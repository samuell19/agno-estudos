"Rural Denmark." "Rural Denmark" doesn't actually exist. To me, the center of the world is where you live. The land of your childhood is wherever you grow up. There's rain, sun, horses in the east wind. "Rural". What is that? Sure, but you speak from a very romanticized perspective. My childhood in rural Denmark was awful. Your book "Rural Tales" reminds me of a provincial version - - of Morten Pape's "The Plan". What made you write it? I think I avoided writing it for a long time, keeping my distance - - but it's a necessary transition before I can write about something else. I do admit that there is a fear of the crime scene. No matter how much I fictionalize, I'll never be comfortable going home. PERSONA NON GRATA Hi. Hello, Laura. Oh my... You look so different. What have you done to your long, pretty hair? I actually really like it this way. - It is very short. - Yes. - It's almost boyish in the back. - Yes. Jannik has been in full swing with the wedding. - And Cathrine has been very helpful. - Well, it is their wedding. - I guess Mogens will do the cooking? - Yes, of course. I can't believe he's still here. Lots of places are closing down. Things aren't looking good. It's after that horrible discount store opened by the highway. So things do happen out here. - There was a break-in at my shop. - Really? - Yes. - What can you steal from a flower shop? - 4,000 DKK in change. - Oh no. Now it's gone. Why can't people behave? There have always been maladjusted young people around here. - They should all go to prison. - No, mom. Instead of bothering other people like that. It doesn't help. They'll just be labeled as criminals. - They are criminals! - They won't develop, then. They have to reintegrate into society, but that's difficult - - if you're young, ostracized and considered a criminal loser. - I guess we don't agree. - That's not the point. It's a fact that it doesn't benefit society to put young people in jail. Then I don't need to say anymore. I'll just shut up. But it is wonderful that everybody's helping out. Where are you getting the cake from? From the main street. Where else? It's been so long since you've been home, Laura. - Mom, please call me Irina. - I can never remember that weird name. But I changed my name a long time ago. First, I couldn't call you Loppenberg. Now I can't call you Laura. My name isn't Laura anymore. I understand that it's difficult, but I'd be happy if you tried. Well, you were named after your great-grandmother, Laura. - Well, I've taken another name. - And I don't get that. Sure... Go in, and then I'll get some potatoes. I never even met great-grandmother Laura, okay? Mom! RURAL TALES Here's your dad! - Hi. - Hi. - Who is she? - That's Cathrine's daughter. - Hello, sweetheart. Hi. - Hi. - Jannik! Grab a bag, please? - Sure. - Good. - They are heavy. - It's Cathrine? - What do you mean? That Cathrine? There were so many people at the store! Hi, Jane. Hi! Wow, your hair sure is short! Hi. - It looks great. - Yes. - Thanks. - And you have a new name. Irine? Irina. - Is that a pen name? - What? A... you know, pen name? You could say that, yes. - You don't look like an Irina. - No, but that's my name now. - Are you from Eastern Europe now? - Jannik! Alternative names are great. Not many Danish girls are called Jessica, right, sweetheart? I named her after Carrie from "Sex and the City". Sarah Jessica-Parker. You never watched "Sex and the City"? - No. - Why didn't you say anything? - Say what? - It's Cathrine. - What's wrong with Cathrine? - What do you mean? She bullied me my whole life. - No. You've never been bullied. - What? Why didn't anyone tell me that Jannik was marrying her? - It said so on the invitation! - It only said "Cathrine". - Why didn't you call me and tell me? - Why don't you call once in a while? - I... I have tried. - Actually, you haven't, Laura. You're home now, and we've looked forward to celebrating this wedding. - Yes, but it can be difficult... - No! I have to make dinner now. - What are you doing? - What does it look like? - You're welding something. - To put on the tractor. - I see. "Just married". - No, no. It's going to say "Born to be married". Across. - And then some cans attached. - Nice. Nice. - Where's your hair? - My bachelor party was nuts. - Cathrine is furious. - How could you do that, Jannik? It wasn't my idea! The boys brought the razor, we were wasted... How can you marry Cathrine? Wouldn't it have been a good idea to talk to me about it? Why do you care? Didn't she freak out over my book? Half of it is about her. - No. - No? And how about you? You just don't...? - Honestly, Jannik. - I don't know. I haven't read it. - You seriously haven't read it? - No. You know that. Me and books... It takes me forever to read a comic book. They haven't even read it! Isn't that good? Shouldn't we be happy about that? Sure, sure... That's good. It's just far out. And seeing my brother together with Cathrine... - That's totally fucked. - Don't let it bother you, honey. - I know. Yes. - Call me later. Bye. Dinner's ready! Everything becomes girlish without alloy wheels. This is "Pop FM". Awesome and more variety! Hi, Dad. - Careful with the dirt. - Yes. What's wrong with it? She can't make up her mind. - About calving? - Yes. There's no avoiding it. She has to do it. - Mom says it's dinner time. - Sure. Jannik's making aquavit for the wedding. But I'm removing the chilies - - because it shouldn't just be for men! - Women can drink spicy stuff too. - Yes... Of course. Just like they can have short hair. It took some courage to get short hair. I've been sensitive about it ever since what you did back then. I don't know about you, but I've grown up. I'd spent all day doing it. And I had done everything like you said, Jane. And I told them: "Yes, you might find it a bit..." Do you want some? "... unconventional with meat loaf, but this meat loaf is amazing!" - Didn't they like it, or what? - I opened the oven and pulled it out. - What do you think happened? - The dog ate it? Yes, dammit. That little bastard ate it! - So you had no food for them? - No, we had nothing! I'm sorry, but someone had turned off the radio. - Then I can't drive them in. - I thought the music stressed them out. No. When they get used to something, it has to stay like that. I can't even change the channel. It has to be "Pop FM". Potatoes? - Is something wrong with the food? - No, it's fine. - How about some meat? - No thanks. I don't eat meat. - What should I make for you, then? - Nothing. This is fine. - No, I'll find something. - Don't worry about it. - Then put some gravy on it. - No. - There's no meat in it. - But there's cream. - Yes. - I don't eat animal products. - What? - But that's our livelihood. You used to eat tons of meat. You were a meathead! - But I'm wiser now. - So now we're supposed to feel bad? I don't mention your food habits. I don't meddle in what you do. It's just that now that the Earth is basically about to collapse... - Here she goes again. - It's not wrong to talk about it. Ruining the good mood is wrong! Mom has been cooking for hours. It's got nothing to do with mom. It's about the environment. Does it make a difference whether we or the neighbor bought that? - It's dead anyway! - There's potatoes and vegetables. - You ate meat, but now it's wrong! - You should think about it. Why should we do anything? It's the US and China who are polluting. Jannik, you have to have an opinion. What do you want? - It's not that I don't care. - Stop it, you two! Let's not talk about the stupid environment. I'd rather like to hear how your life as a writer is going, Irina. - It's going well. - Are you writing something? - Yes. - Is it a novel? - It's a literary experiment. - Interesting. - Does it pay well? - That's not what it's about. - Jussi Adler makes a lot of money. - I'm doing fine without money. You probably get support. Then the rest of us can work and pay taxes. - Mom, are you okay? - I'm so sorry. Don't apologize. We have lots of glasses. Jane, you can't lift things like that. - Is your arthritis very bad? - No. Yes, it is. You take a lot of pills. It is bad. All those pills can be very toxic for you, mom. - She needs to get better. - But there can be many... We'll find some other glasses. Dad knows where they are. Where is he? Iver? Did Jannik tell you how he proposed to me? It was the most romantic dinner. We were at a restaurant. Then I had dessert. I had a... - What's it called, honey? - Crème brûlée. You have to crack the surface, you know? And suddenly, I see something glittering. - And then this ring pops up. - Oh my! I can't believe it. Did you really come up with that? How original, Jannik! I keep telling Jane it's the most beautiful ring I've ever owned. I'm so honored that you let me have it, Jane. Look. Is that... Is that your old engagement ring, mom? - It was just lying in a drawer. - It was your great-grandmother's? Yes, great-grandmother Laura. Then your grandmother, then me. So I thought: "Now, Jannik and Cathrine can have it." - You always said I would inherit it. - You never liked my jewelry, Laura. No, you're right. It's not my style. Not my style at all, actually... Anyway, I simply love it. Benjamin Bang, congratulations on your climate manifesto novel. And it's not just a novel. There's art surrounding it. We shouldn't just consider climate change as something intellectual. We must visualize it, so we can understand the consequences. You didn't do it alone. You've brought an artist. I have to say that Asger has stopped talking, as a principle. He only expresses himself through his art. I greatly respect that. So how did you agree on how the art project should look? - This is my girlfriend, Irina. - Hi. - This is Mike. You know Hanne. - Nice to see you. - It's simply beautiful, Benjamin. - Irina, this is Aya. I read your book. It's fantastic. Your story really touched me. I'm pleased to hear that. Benjamin tells me you also write? Well, it's my first book, so let's see. I'm just glad that Benjamin is helping me. - There's not much I can do... - Yes. No. You're extremely good. Who the hell brings flowers to a climate change exhibition? Hello there. Nice to see you. - You were quite good in that interview. - Oh? Thank you. - Are you publishing something new? - I'm working on something. It's probably none of my business. Fuck it, I'll tell you anyway. I saw Benjamin sitting with a girl at Bobibar the other day. - It looked pretty intense. - Don't... - Really intense. - You know, it's totally fine. Benjamin and I are in an open relationship. I didn't know. I'm glad you told me - - because they were actually making out. I didn't know whether to tell you or not, but you deserve to know. You don't own one another. I understand if other people can't make it work. But for us, it's the right thing to do. And, well, we trust each other when it comes to loving each other. You make it sound beautiful. Maybe I should suggest it to my boyfriend. - Climate anxiety has fucked him up. - In what way? He can't get it up. He's impotent, pure and simple. - He's like: "What's the point?" - Well... In some way, he's right, you know? I just think it's a bad idea. Maybe I shouldn't go. - Wouldn't that be okay? - I get that it's difficult. But if there is a confrontation, then you have to face it. I know the feeling. I'm from Jutland too! Sure you are, but you come from a home with a piano - - and your parents are academics. It's not the same. That may be. But you have to believe that your background - - is your great artistic strength. It is. People can feel it. Do you think it's easy being a writer with a happy childhood? Stop it! Get back to your ice floes, so we can go home. Did you know that climate anxiety can make you impotent? - Who did that happen to? - Emma's boyfriend. Impotent... from climate anxiety? - Yes, Jane. You have cramps. - Odd. I never had that before. - Didn't the pills help? - What's happening? - It's nothing. - Did you fold all those by yourself? I told you to be careful. Don't do anything else with your hands. - And don't work on those flowers. - That's my job anyway. Yes, I asked Laura, or Irina, to help me. - Well, there is a plan for their look. - She helped me in the shop many times. - Jane, I can do it myself. It's fine. - But you have enough to do. - Cathrine is making her wedding dress. - Then you're busy. We'll get it done. Right, mom? We will. Don't feed that to the chickens. It's rice. You're supposed to throw it at your mom tomorrow at the church. To make her fertile, so you can have a little brother or sister. A little Miranda or Samantha, perhaps. - Is your mom nice to you? - Yes. - She also yells sometimes, right? - No. - Is she a bit mean sometimes? - No. - Hi. - Hi. - It's been a while. - You still listen to D-A-D! - And you still listen to Nirvana? - That's not the same thing! What's up? It's been such a long time. - You look the same. - No comments about my hair? - No. - Everybody comments on it. - I can't believe you wrote a book. - Yeah, that's... And it's about us wackjobs out here? Yes. But don't worry, I didn't mention you. You didn't write about the guy who was spectacular in bed? - Next time. - Okay. And... What else? What do you do? - I work at a restaurant, "The Flame". - Is it a nice place? - Yes, if you like buffets. - No, do you like working there? Yes, it's a nice place. - Well, I'm the flower girl, so... - Just like old times. I'm the beer man, folding chair man, pavilion man and cable man... - Jannik doesn't do shit. - He has enough on his hands! - It was nice to see you. - Likewise. See you around. - That's what I call bling. - Cathrine likes them. - And they are purple. - They sure are. Did you know you can get cannabis oil for arthritis? - Cannabis? No thanks. - Medicinal cannabis. It's an oil. It's not like smoking and getting high. - Maybe it could help. - I don't want it, Laura. - I don't want it. - It might help you. Hold this, please. - Do you recognize it, Laura? - Yes, of course. How did they break in? Did they smash a window? No, that's the embarrassing part. When I arrived, the place wasn't locked. The door was open. Stupid me. The young people leave this town - - and then it's only us old people who stay behind. So I almost only make funeral sprays! Thanks to that damn discount store. That's the table decoration. She wants two and three on the tables. - Did you make that? - No, that was Cathrine. - Did you get a new counter? - Well... Do you remember your small counter where you sold lottery tickets? - You sure sold a lot, Laura. - You bought half, mom. No, dad also bought some. You were so happy when the sales went well! You read your "Narnia" books here. You didn't care for the after-school club. And why do you think that was? Why do you think I always spent time here? Hi. There you are! Hi. Your flowers are pretty. Maybe I overdid it, but I was afraid I might have ordered too few. You ordered them? I don't get it. Do you work here now? Well, I'm taking over the store this fall. I'd rather have a family member take over than see it close. Don't place them like that. They'll fall over when we drive. Listen, I usually place them like this, fixed. - You could, but don't. - Why not place them like I did? - Because they'll fall over! - Stop it. They'll be fine. Stop it! Fine, I don't give a fuck. Fine. We'll do it your way. Lesbo Laura! Did you seriously just say that? Ever since you came home, it's put a dampener on everyone's mood! You think you're so fucking important. I feel sorry for your mom. - We must remember to lock the place! - You can borrow my keys. - No, I have my own. - Move. I'll take the van. Laura, will you jump in here? - We can bring them inside. - Yes. No! Shit. And they've snapped... If you don't pack the van properly, it'll go wrong. - I'd never have placed them like that. - I saw you driving like a maniac! You know what? Just forget it. - Are you insane? - Honey? You know she's a bit edgy about tomorrow. And then you accuse her of... She's nervous. I don't want to listen to her. She has been very mean to me, okay? - What? - She has always been like that. You guys have just decided to forget or suppress it. I wouldn't be surprised if she stole the money from mom's store. She's the only one with a key apart from my mom. Do you realize what you're accusing her of? - I'm just saying... - Just relax! - Who's that? - That's Benjamin. - Is that Benjamin? - Hi! - If you don't stop that...! - She stole a lot when we were kids. - I don't want to hear it! - Let's say hello. - Hi. Benjamin. - Welcome. Thanks for having me. Here you are. - You shouldn't have. - Sure. - You have to use that, okay? - Yes. You're angry. All those emotions with Cathrine. - Use it creatively. - Yes. You look so cute there. - Remember? It was your tenth birthday. - You don't need to tell that story. It was quite a time back then. The girls couldn't get along. You know how silly girls can be. You were so angry. She went to her room and packed her bag. Then she ran away from home! She trudged over the fields. Yes. You had such a temper back then. Hi. - Did they put up the wheel? - No. They could use an extra guy. - Yes, of course. - And move your car. It's in the way. - Dad...! - The tractor can't get past. - I'll be in the cowshed. - Of course. I think they're sweet. I'd feared it would be much worse. The place is also cozy, almost. - Can't we just go? - Sure... I'm David. Cool glasses. - Sure. It's the same type. - Yeah, right? They're exactly the same. Funny. We are three men now! Would you take one of these ropes? And throw it over there. Laura, throw that one over there. - If you take... - "Laura"? - Why did you call her "Laura"? - You didn't know, of course. It's... It's because my name is Laura. Or it was, until I changed it to Irina. Your name is Laura? I'm sorry I didn't tell you. It's because I never think about it. It's fine. Let's just... - Oh dear. - Just get it up over. - That's it. - Grab the other one. - Should I take one of them? - No problem. I can do it. Are you sure? It's heavier than it looks. Hold them both. On three. Ready? Nice and easy. One, two, three... - It was heavier... - Benjamin, pull. Pull them both. Use your weight. One of them is lopsided. Pull one, loosen the other! - Which one? - The right one. Your left. - Pull, and use your weight. - Keep looking at the wheel! - Honey, pull that one... - Watch out! - You're standing on that. - Just stop it. - Don't hold that... - Let go of that! It's not working. - We need to get it on the table. - Jannik, seriously... It'll be all right. We just need Benjamin to adjust it. - We'll just try again. Are you okay? - Yes. It's so fucking primitive. It's primitive! It wasn't that heavy. It's not about strength, but technique. Your brother and David obviously feel threatened by a man like me. - I don't think they're that insightful. - Sure they are! I must be put in my place. No threats to the status quo allowed here! This is too much for me! I'm going upstairs. I promised Aya to look at that stuff. I'm going upstairs. - Jannik, please be nice to Benjamin. - What do you mean? You know what I mean. Shouldn't you be nice to Cathrine, then? - I shouldn't have called her a thief. - You always look down on others. I didn't mean... I may not wear the right clothes, vote for some dumb alternative party - - and have sex with men, women and animals. But I'm doing well. I'm happy, actually. Don't feel sorry for me, dammit. I don't have sex with animals, Jannik. - Well, you know... - No. - You know what I mean. - No! What a sick thing to say. - You are from the country. - You live here! Yeah. I found a woman. No more animals for me! Pull! I remember Cathrine lived with a foster family. No one talked about it. - It was cancer, right? - Yeah. We should appreciate our old folks while they're still alive. Where did Benjamin go? He had to work. He's a mentor for another writer. As long as he behaves, I'm happy. Because otherwise you'll beat him up? No, we'll have a little "chat" with him. Pull! - You remember Camilla's guy, right? - Oh sure! He had tons of affairs. Then we paid him a visit - - and he stopped fooling around. - Well, Benjamin has tons of affairs. - What? Yes. - What? - Say what? We have an open relationship, so don't come by with your squad of thugs. I can't believe you two used to date. You are complete opposites. You're in an open relationship, and he lives in celibacy. - Are you celibate, David? - No. You are! When he's into someone - - there's no hanky-panky. Then he's like a monk. - I don't want to talk about it. - Who are you into? - A waitress at the restaurant. - Are you dating? - No, he's done nothing, that faggot! - Jannik, you idiot! Don't say "faggot". - Ask her out, David. - Let's just take it slow. You can say that again. It couldn't get any slower. She doesn't even know that they are in a slow relationship. Tell her! - Do as the lady says. - Leave him alone. Go. - Write her a text. - Pull! Yes! Welcome to the Jessica Disco! We're going to decorate the tables to music. Are you old enough? Never mind! Come in. Dance! This is just for kids. Who is that old woman, Jessica? - Are they yours? Can I try? - Yes. Did you know that Laura can also do an animal, a creature? She can do a Loppenberg. Ask Laura to show it to you. It's been so long. I don't know if I can do it anymore. She can, Jessica. She's just kidding. - It would make Jessica happy. - Yes, but... You meanie. I don't remember Loppenberg. What's going on here? What's all this? - What do you mean? - Why does it look like that? Because it had to look nice. Okay, but what the hell is this green stuff? That was to fill the empty spaces, to make up for the flowers. - Doesn't it look nice, Cathrine? - No. I wanted it simple and purple. I'd already made some decorations, so why has it turned out so bush-like? - No, it's all right... - Wow, it looks nice in here! - It looks like crap. - What do you mean? The flowers, Jannik! It doesn't look the way I wanted. I was very specific. - Do you want to change it, Cathrine? - No, it looks freaking great! Honey? It's fine. It'll just be like this, then. Do you honestly think this is beautiful? They live in a completely different world out here. They don't even sort their waste. No, they definitely don't. Look, it was stupid of me to get provoked by that wheel. - Yes... - It just annoyed me. It was dumb. I'm usually above such things. I've written five novels. Jannik can't boast about that. No, but he's actually dyslexic. I fully understand why you ran away from this place - - and why the two of us could never be happy out here. How come we haven't seen this before? All these modern things are amazing. It's the internet. You can find everything there. Irina and Benjamin, there's some vegetarian food for you in the oven. - I think it's gluten-free too. - Thanks, mom. And Cathrine found this interview with you, Laura. - Do you really want to see that? - Of course we do! No, no. I don't think we should see it. Look! Your hair is so nice. ... rural Denmark is nothing new. "Home" has always been an identity. - I don't feel like watching this. - Quiet. - Let's not watch that. - Quiet, Laura! Look at that nice, long hair. It simply has to die out. Generations will have to die out. It's like plowing the fields. How did you find the courage to break away and move on? I've always felt like an outsider. Staying wasn't an option for me, if you will. It was one prolonged escape. My childhood was awful. I felt completely abandoned. I was systematically bullied. My parents didn't see it nor hear it, because they lacked the strength. That, to me, is rural Denmark. I don't have this romanticized feeling of going home. I don't want to go home. I flee from that place. The people there can't escape. It's like an evolutionary dead-end. Can't we turn it off? I was never able to live in a place like rural Denmark... I don't mean it like that. It's a discussion where you kind of push things to the limit. It's a xenophobic, homophobic and heteronormative society... You have the right to your opinion. They're taking it too personally. Don't be... I'm okay... We hear Jesus said that the last should be first and vice versa. That dishonest officials and indecent women were seen and heard. How loud, blind, lost sons - - doubting disciples, thieves and robbers, even those who no one liked - - were always called forth and attended to by Jesus before anyone else. And with a very surprising result. Jesus never let his view of others be narrowed by norms and prejudice. Or faults. Everywhere, he saw potential in us and our human lives - - where no one else could see there was anything of interest. And that opened people's hearts. Jessica! Don't step on it! Yes, yes. - Do I stand here? - Yes. One moment. Come over here and join us. We're ready now. - Smile now. - Smile, honey. - You're wearing the veil. - Yes, yes! - It's the wind. - Sure. Congratulations! Not that hard! - Bye. - Yeah! What's with the phone? Aya's got writer's block, so she needs my help. - Does it have to be right now? - Yeah, you know how it is. I'm gonna call her and give her some notes. - Hi, Laura. - Hi, Sasha. Jeanette. - Laura... - You chose to wear white today. I don't get it. You're not supposed to do that at a wedding. - I didn't know, actually. - Cathrine said you'd cut off your hair. - It looks nice. - Different, in any case. Perhaps it looks like that time when Cathrine cut off my hair. Remember? It was at my tenth birthday. Cathrine said my hair smelled like cow shit. She made two of the boys hold me down and cut off my hair. Don't you remember that? David, you remember it, right? - What? - When Cathrine cut off my hair. Oh sure. Then she started that rumor about me being a lesbian. Out here, where people will then hunt you with fucking pitchforks! Stop it, Laura. What kind of behavior is this! - Let me help... - No, don't help! Keep your mouth shut. It's Jannik's day today. Behave yourself. Can't you let him have this one day? - Please seat yourselves, folks! - We're coming. Don't worry, it's not a speech! Dear, beautiful people... and Jannik! Welcome to this barn party. This place looks so nice. My name is David. I'm the best man and toastmaster. In other words: I'm on overtime. Make some more friends, Jannik! We have our first speaker, the mother of the groom. Yes... Hello, everyone. I've never made a speech before, but there's a first time for everything. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate you guys. I love you very much. I want to say that it's so nice that we've become a family. Cathrine looks so beautiful... ...in her gorgeous dress that she made herself. You've got to be kidding me! - Cathrine has so many skills... - She didn't make it herself. It's wonderful to see you so happy. That was it, I guess. Long live the bride and groom! Hurray! We are gathered at a wedding party And we have been invited as guests This will be such a lovely day One that we'll remember every day Cathrine is such a lovely girl... Might be dangerous to smoke near those. I don't give a shit. It'll be all right. - We didn't get properly introduced. - No. Karina. The bride's cousin. You probably know me as "Cousin Karina". - Irina. - No, Karina. I'm Irina. But you probably know me as "Lesbo Laura". Oh, that's true. I remember that. What was the thing about that dress? - It's mine. - Yours? Last Monday, she came to me, desperate. Her project was going south. She can't sew, dammit! So you gave her your old wedding dress. - No, she had to pay for it. - How much? As for the wedding night we say: "Break a leg" Has Cathrine even seen it before? We can't promise that it'll get any bigger. Jannik, Jannik...! I thought I might as well get rid of it. It just brings back bad memories. - That's typically Cathrine. - That's damn typically Cathrine. - Cheers! - Congratulations. I need to talk to you. Jannik, I was right all along. - You're always right! - We need to talk. - You'll want to know this. - Laura! You're out of line. I just need to talk to you for a moment, okay? I fucking wish you weren't here. Get back to your loser boyfriend and leave us alone. Yes, yes! Cheers, everyone. - Cheers! - Cheers. Hi, everyone! I'm Jannik's sister, as you probably know. I'll make it brief. Congratulations, you two. You both look great. And it's not that I don't want to compliment your nice dress, Cathrine - - but we should in fact compliment your cousin Karina. Because you bought it from her, so you didn't make it yourself. But there's no shame in that. I just wish you hadn't stolen the money from my mom's shop to pay for it. Because that's what you did, right? I need to add - - that Karina received the same amount which went missing on that very day. You had the key and could just let yourself in. It's just crazy that you can have that on your conscience. She even wants you to take over her shop. So I just hope you'll take good care of it. It's been her life's work for 35 years. Well, that was all I had to say. Cheers, everyone! - Cheers... - And congratulations. Did you take that money? Let's go home. This is fucked. People are... And you seem a bit stressed. - I had to say something. - Sure. You've done all you could. Shouldn't we just go home? Sure. Of course. Iver? There's a cow out here... There are actually two. - They just came around the corner. - I told you they were stressed. Follow me. Come on! Get inside. - It's best if I join them. - What do you mean? - I want to help. - I'm trying to be here for you. You constantly leave me alone with these people. Is that fair? I want to help my dad. We'll go home afterwards. Come. Yes, come on! That's it. That's it... Good. Go on. Go on. Easy. Yes. That's good. David. David. Hey. Can't we talk anymore either? Jannik needed to know about it. - I just don't understand you. - I thought you would. Of all people. You know exactly how Cathrine treated me. It's got nothing to do with that! I don't want to be a part of it. - You know I'm right. - Are you really that self-centered? I was 17. You may have talked about going to Copenhagen - - but one evening, your mom opened the door, because you'd left. You didn't even say goodbye. And now you want me to defend you? You don't even have your own shit together! - That's different. - How is that different? Then a farmer promises 5,000 DKK, but you have to pay 1,000. We spent all this time preparing this event, Laura! Why are you angry at me? You guys should know how Cathrine is. - As if she's a criminal. - She is! The people you want in prison. - I'm sorry. - Jannik, don't apologize. I'm so lucky to have you sorting everything out for me. - Mom, I... - I guess I don't understand anything. You think I'm stupid! Cathrine! You have to go in and fix it. - You should apologize. - Go away. You've ruined my wedding! - You think everything is about you. - Fine. They all hate you anyway. No one wants you here! - What are you saying? - That your family hates you. They hate you, Laura. Even your own mother doesn't like you. Give me my ring. Give me my ring. - No. - Give it to me! No, it's mine. Stop it. Laura, don't. Don't. Laura, stop! No. Stop it! Go away. Go away! It all went wrong. Otherwise, I'd never have taken that money! I told everyone I'd sew that dress, and then it all went wrong! That's not an excuse to rob my mom. We didn't have jack shit back home. I shared a room with my two stepbrothers. But you had your own room. You had a stereo set. At your place, you had dinner together. The whole family. And you guys had fun. I remember - - that Iver put red sausages in his ears. And when we sat around the dining table - - I just felt... I don't know... I had this feeling that I never wanted to leave this place. I can't handle a damn thing. I only know how to be Jessica's mom and Jannik's wife. Maybe. - It's quite a feat being Jannik's wife. - Okay, Laura. I know that Jannik is... the way he is. But... I don't know. I just love him so fucking much. - We have to go back. - Not like this. I look like shit! Ouch, dammit! I think I twisted my ankle. Give me that. There. You look nice now. Are you sure? Yes. Come. Let's have a drink. What do you want? Vodka? - She could've borrowed the money. - That wouldn't have been a problem. - Hi, Jessie, honey. - Mommy! I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean to cry. I'm just a bit upset. - I love you. - I love you too. Could you play "Let Your Fingers Do The Walking" after this? - Please, it's Jannik's favorite song. - No. What a hillbilly dj. - Where have you been? - Where the hell have you been? Well... I had a fight. You had a fight? With whom? With Cathrine. It was fucked. I don't know what happened. - Everything's good now... - What the hell's going on? I'm packing my stuff, and then we're going home. Right? Yes. I just need to say goodbye, all right? Five minutes. Have you seen my mom? It's just because I'm going home now. I don't want to leave without saying goodbye... again. - So you admit it? - It's... Well... David, you were the only reason I stayed for as long as I did. - You were my only friend. - No, I was your boyfriend, Laura. Yes. I understand that you're angry with me. I'm not angry. I just remember you being funnier. Maybe my memory fails me. Like "the weather used to be better in the old days". No, you remember correctly. I was funny. I still am. I am. - Do you remember Loppenberg? - Yes. Loppenberg. Loppen-Loppenberg! Come on! Was that it? You also did... Your legs were funny, right? - Are we there yet? - You want to dance with Loppenberg? Sure. Loppenberg! What the hell's going on? It's a character I do. Loppenberg. My parents used to call me Loppenberg. - Come on. Step outside. - Relax. Come on. - You think it's embarrassing. - You're making fun of disabled people! I don't... We were just having a good time! - What the hell's wrong with you? - Relax. - I'm worried about you, Irina. - Because I'm having fun dancing? - I've been worried since yesterday. - You want me to act a specific way. No, I don't recognize you at all. It's like you're a whole other person. - Get in. We're going home. - No. You can just go. Get the fuck home to Aya. It's all right. That's our deal, right? Go back to her. Where did he go? Are you going home now too? No. That's Jannik's favorite song! What if I had never left... Then we might've tied the knot today. - You think? - No, you would've been bored to death. We shouldn't kiss. - I can't. - No, no... - I'm in love with someone else. - You don't need to explain. - Then you can't just... - No, no. It's just me. Laura. There. You'd have these terrible tantrums when you were a child. Jannik, I could just sent him out to the garage to work on a motorbike. It wasn't like that with you. I don't know... Dad and I... It's not because we didn't want to. It... We just didn't know what to do with you. I know I always correct you and act like a smart ass. That's all right. Never stop correcting me. If that happens, then I know you've stopped caring about your old mother. They just keep partying in there. Well, that's fine, I guess. That monstrosity was our gift to Jannik. It was difficult to wrap! Why didn't you teach me to drive a tractor, dad? Nah, I think we'll leave that to Jannik. On the other hand, you know about stuff that we don't understand. It is, of course, there... - Obviously. - Let's go over here. This room is a bit bigger. It's a bedroom... The view faces west...
