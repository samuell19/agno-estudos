Unless I need to inform mission control that you're not ready for landing. = I'm fine. Okay, then. Maybe we can sing a song that you actually like. I didn't use to mind listening to that song. = oh? But things changed. Status, commander? Systems stable, ready for un-docking. Pressure readings are within nominal limits. Roger, proceed according to schedule. So here's the plan. After we get out of recovery, I'm going to go home. Get to my apartment, kick off my shoes, then I'm walking straight down the hallway right to the bathroom in some hot water. With just a little bit of cold, just a bit. - Yeah. - And I'll climb in, and god help anyone who interrupts me. He will literally need to step in save them. And you? I'm going to rostov. What do you have there? Someone. Another girl, huh? No surprise there. All of them love you. You are not going to tell me. Temperature 23 degrees, proceed to release the latches. Copy that, commander. = the latch is released. Controlling departure from the station. Initiating disengagement. We now have un-docked successfully. Copy. So, as I said, I'll take a hot bath and then get out and dry off with a towel, a big one. Then the Cologne, can't forget that. My wife and I will dress up real nice and finally, I'll take her to the to a concert and that's when she'll sing just for me, j a million, million, million Scarlet roses what's that? Maybe it was the utility module. = t don't see it. - I'm checking out the window. - Copy. Stupid piece of junk. Come on, come on, come on, come on! Hold it steady. You can do it. How was that? = konstantin. Soviet Kazakhstan. 1983 Moscow. Research institute of brain ams ussr Are they coming? Good evening. Good evening. Thank you, we can begin now. There isn't much to be said here. I propose we skip introductions and get started with the interview. = proceed. Do you mind? The sooner we finish with this review the better it will be for everyone, don't you think? =I'm in no rush. That's not the point. We're not your enemies, tatyana. We know your methods are different. No one is accusing you of knowingly attempting to injure a patient. But you must admit that what you did was negligent. If I was negligent it means that I failed to carry out my job. I did what was necessary. And almost drowned your patient. I temporarily cut off his oxygen supply. He was not properly diagnosed. The standard therapy was unsuccessful. You held him under water for nearly a minute. The boy is 17. His mother spent the last two weeks complaining to the health minister. His mother is the problem. He's experiencing psychogenic seizures because she's too overprotective. I've managed to block them, but they're going to come back if you don't prevent her from seeing him. Ms. yurevna, nothing you say here is going to change what happened so let me be absolutely clear. You have exactly two options left. Either you admit that you were negligent and accept our verdict to dismiss you, or we will send your file to the prosecutor's office. I imagine they'd have much more to say. I did what I know is right. Tatyana yurevna, may I have a word? I already told you everything in the inquiry. I'm actually not from the health ministry. My name is semiradov. I would like to get your opinion on something. To help you, or is this for someone else? I have a patient. I'd like you to come with me to examine him. Then you'll have to bring him here so I can look at him before they dismiss me in the next two weeks. Unfortunately, I cannot. However, I believe this is something you'll want to see. = is this a choice or an order? I don't believe in giving orders. In my experience, intelligent people are rarely motivated when they are asked to follow a direct order. Interesting. That doesn't sound very Soviet. I'm not much of a politician. What we do is very similar. I'm in charge of a type of research institute. I also have an interest in neuropsychiatry. This case is quite unusual, but if it isn't to your liking we can bring you back. Oh, and as for the review board, I took care of them. You have my word. How's the weather ahead? In a crosswind. The weather is clear. Good. Please help yourself. When we arrive the cafeteria likely won't have much to offer. Unfortunately, when it comes to that there's not much I can do. If it's not classified, is there a medical history? We have yet to have one prepared I'm afraid. Does a not suffice? I'm sure by now you've heard about the landing of orbit four. = t have. We had to sanitize what the media received. We actually lost contact with the crew before they landed. It appears something went wrong during reentry somehow. The patient is the commanding officer, konstantin veshnyakov. We diagnosed him with amnesia. Do you want me to sign the nda now or after we land? Nondisclosure agreement? Putting your original diagnoses of amnesia aside, suppose this cosmonaut of yours lost his mind. That wouldn't be good. I can't imagine the Soviet governments want people to know that their national hero went insane, so what do I have to sign? Soviet Kazakhstan All-union scientific research institute we already have access to most of the facility, but for now no one will question you while you're with me. Once you have security clearance you may enter the restricted areas on your own. Focus on the sound of my voice. With each count of the metronome, you will feel a pleasant drowsiness begin to settle over you. One, two. A comforting warmth is now spreading throughout your body. Are they able to see us? Three. Tea, coffee? Is there anything else you like that I can get for you? Four. Tea if you would. Five. Let everything around you fade away. You are back in space. I am in space. What do you see? I see something large. Dark blue? A whale. No. Now try again. Tell me your name and rank. Robert duvall, d. Field Marshall Robert d. Duvall. = that's how this is? In case it didn't work? Commander veshnyakov. We're clearly not going to make any progress if you don't want to work with me. Dr. leonardovich, I don't mean to be. Maybe it's because of my training that I can't be hypnotized. = that's bullshit. I am reporting you. Yan leonardovich rigel. He's the research director for our institute. It's a pleasure. A pleasure? God damn it! = colonel semiradov? Tell me where averchenko is. Let me go unless I'm guilty and give me a trial. Are you listening? If you don't say anything I'll stop eating. What do you want me to do? Mm, to begin with, what is your first impression of his condition? What's this? They found another one? Are they really that desperate? Good evening, I'm tatyana. My evening's getting better. Hey, colonel, it's about time. Dr. rigel had me wanting to kill myself. Do you want some tea? = don't mind if I do. You're new here aren't you? I just arrived today. They wanted another opinion on your condition. A toy? Yes, it's mine. I used to play with it. It's a cosmonaut tradition to take something personal with you on each mission. They let me keep it while I'm here. Can you tell me what happened? Again? I began the usual launch preparations and we left the station without incident. We prepared for landing. Beyond that I don't remember how I got here. I've already told them a dozen times. Didn't they make you read it? Not yet but I'll do it later. Tatyana, please forgive me if I'm wrong, but you don't make the decisions here. = t don't. Then you can't discharge me. No, but it's possible I can help you. Yes, you can. Do me a favor. My mother, give her a call when you're done here. 360-7344. Her name is Lydia. Be sure to tell her that you saw me and that I'm okay. She'll want to know. You really should just go home. I feel totally fine. In fact, better than ever. If I can survive in space then I'll manager here, too. May I? It was very nice to meet you. Are you examining him or not? I just did. He has post-traumatic stress disorder and tactile sensitivity in his hands has diminished. It's likely his peripheral nervous system may be damaged as well. But considering the way that you're imprisoning him against his will, it's to be expected. I suppose if we expected it, we wouldn't put him in isolation. Everyone plays their own games. Is that all? You promised I could leave. There is others out there that I could help. = of course. We will transport tomorrow. Please show tatyana to her room. The cafeteria serves three meals a day. = there is no need. I'll be leaving tomorrow. Colonel semiradov hasn't authorized your departure, so you might be here for awhile. Oh, he'll do it. = grab those boards. Try one here. - Who are they? They're cleaners, cleaners. Brought here for. Room 108, at the end of the hall. I can't get a room closer to the stairs? It's what they gave you. Operator. = I'd like to make a call to Moscow. Calls outside the base cannot be made without authorization from the colonel. I see, thank you. Thank you. Go back to your post. You're still awake, excellent. Did you have dinner? I'm not hungry. How long has it been since you ate? I don't know, four hours ago. If you like, you can have a closer look. What is it? = t have no idea. Only that it's not from earth. - It lives in veshnyakov? - Yes, but it doesn't harm him. He's healthier than ever. The creature is able to come and go from him as it pleases every night exactly like you just saw. He lets it? He's completely unaware of it. What? Understand we still have no idea how it happened. Our men went into space alone and they returned with this. = and the other cosmonaut? He died. How? = as a hero. I told you this case was unusual. My job was to find out how this thing got here and how to protect us from it, but I need you to find a way to separate this parasite from its host. Otherwise, you can sign the nondisclosure agreement and go back home tomorrow. I don't understand why you're asking me to do this. I'm not military. I've never worked with classified material. Why me? I heard about the boy. The one that you almost drowned. So you think I have the stomach? Honestly, I don't care about your process. I believe that you can give me results. Whatever it was you did in order to save your patient, you were the only one to actually save him. So, please, I want you to do it again. You are a professional, someone who can save a hero. I need to see all footage you have of the creature and veshnyakov's account of the landing. All of the notes and analysis and two sessions a day, an hour each. After the landing, veshnyakov was sent to a rehabilitation facility. On the first night the creature emerged and attacked the medical technician. We brought him here to prevent it from escaping. So far we have not found a safe way to separate them. It has formed some sort of paracytic bond with veshnyakov's body. When we tried to remove it, his vital signs immediately begin to deteriorate. He seems to be like a spacesuit for the creature, protecting it from a hostile world. At the same time it increases veshnyakov's ability to heal and regenerate. He was seriously injured in the landing but recovered in just two days. The parasite takes up only 30 centimeters while incubating inside of him. He fits easily inside of his esophagus and stomach, increasing their size by only 30%. When the creature leaves his body each night, he releases a toxin that relaxes him, causing him to sleep. It can increase its size by taking in oxygen to approximately 1.5 meters in length. He can then return after releasing that oxygen. The size of the head constantly changes as well. For now the creature can survive outside of veshnyakov for almost two hours. It regularly leaves his body between 2:40 and 3:10 at night. Parasite or symbiote? That should be enough, commander veshnyakov. I can do more. You were badly injured. There's no need. Take it easy, okay? Besides, I barely believe it. It's quite phenomenal you can do this much already. Have you noticed anything unusual? = not much. A little cough. I guess I could've caught a cold. Well, if it bothers you, tell rigel. That's all. Dismissed. = you're still there. Let's go. I don't suppose you could tell me where veshnyakov's son lives? I believe he lived in rostov before his mother died. That's your only question so far? Do you need a better look at what we're dealing with? What are you feeding it? It eats what veshnyakov eats. Let's make one thing clear, doctor. I'm not here to take your job. I don't want your nobel prize either. You've seen the patient, our analysis and ever inch of footage we have. If there's something you think you still don't have, you should ask colonel semiradov. All right. Is this the orphanage? I'm looking for a young boy it may be something else. This again, huh? Always where you shouldn't be. Get down from there. Keep this up and you'll hurt yourself. What have I told margarite? Nothing to say? I asked you a question. Go back to your room! J I believe friends j j can't advance off rockets j j who lead us from one star to another j don't like my singing? I'm sorry, it's for them. I bet you didn't know. No one likes cosmonaut songs more than jaded ground personnel. We always sang different songs in space. Which songs do you like? Nothing special. The melody's all that matters. J a million, million, million Scarlet roses I can tell you're drawn to me, admit it. You probably asked to come here when you heard, right? Actually I was brought here to see if you'd lost your mind. What did you say? They think that you killed your co-pilot. What's she doing? At some point during the landing, something happened that caused the death of commander averchenko, or perhaps you killed him. Colonel semiradov can't allow a hero whose gone insane to walk back into the world like nothing happened. That's great. You're saying I'm some sort of insane murderer, is that it? I'm sure you know that not everyone who's crazy looks that way. Listen, okay? I know you're smarter than this. I spent years preparing for this flight. I know something went wrong but I don't remember what. And now, I'm stuck in this cell behind armored glass. Did they say why they're holding me here? Will someone just tell me? I'm not a spy or some kind of animal. What then? What do you mean? I want to know, if none of those things describe you, what does? Did you read my file? I'm the Soviet's hero. Do you really believe that? You didn't survive tanks or grenades. All you ever did was sit in a tin can while the government took care of everything for you. You call that heroic? What are you saying? I read your file. Why did you abandon your son? Because I'm curious. You never married the child's mother did you? After she died you could have adopted him, but you wanted to go to space so you could be a Soviet hero instead. I guess an illegitimate child would otherwise ruin your perfect reputation. That's why he's at the orphanage near rostov. Did I miss anything? I grew up without a father. Ti still became a hero. Heroes don't abandon their child. You know what, tatyana? For awhile it was nice to see a pretty face, but from now on I think I'd rather see that idiot, rigel. Thank you for your time. What the hell were you thinking? What could you possibly hope to accomplish? You need to test his endocrine profile right away. = you heard her. Yesterday I noticed his reactions were unusually slow. I believe that it's tied to his hormone levels. Severe psychological stress releases adrenalin into the bloodstream making it easier to test how much is produced. The results of those tests can tell me a lot, in particular what the creature might be feeding on. = and what does that do? Our mission right now is to remove the parasite, not make guesses about how to feed it. Colonel, if I may, I want you to order that veshnyakov be transferred to the medical unit during the day. That way he can interact with other civilians. I think we'll start to see a better clinical picture if we allow him to live a more normal life. "I want you to order.” What's this? A reward for good behavior? It was a momentous day for a many who- - don't you see? I'm trying to help you. The meeting with the Cuban representatives was held without any notable incidents. In fact, they went on to express their gratitude to general secretary and chairman of the presidium, Yuri androkov, and the entire Soviet nation for its immense hospitality. The Soviet people are equally excited to welcome our cosmonauts back from their mission in orbit. Kirill averchenko and konstantin veshnyakov are reported to have landed safely back on earth. These brave heroes are currently staying in a rehabilitation center so they can recover from their long stay in space without gravity.. In approximately three weeks, the world will be able to welcome these great men home. In national sporting, the old union competition between the countries strongest skaters draws to a close in this week. Do you need something? I wanted to apologize. I said those things to upset you so I could measure your hormone levels. I'll leave you alone until our session. See you then. I didn't know about my son. She never told me. A week before I left, they told me she had died and that he didn't have any other relatives. He's in an orphanage. Ti don't even know his name. I thought, "when I get back, I'll get him." Maybe I didn't think at all. Would you have done it any different? = t don't know. Ti don't have a son. Why are you here, tatyana? Ti know I don't have amnesia. So, what do they want? You can't say or you won't? = t can't. But I truly want to help you. Do you really think you can? See if you can move a bit closer. Please try not to interrupt me while I'm working. You don't need to worry. We can try one that doesn't have auditory receptors. Yes, but I do. What are you doing? Tatyana, what are you trying to do? Why do I even bother with her? Tatyana, what are you trying to do? Will you just wait? Well, if that's all we needed. Lift the glass. What? Lift it up. You're sure? Yes, no, we can't risk it. We'll give you a suit. Get her out of there, now! Make sure-= movel colonel! We don't have much by way of flower shops on base, so I picked some for you. How are you feeling? Much better, thank you. Well, what you did was very brave. At least now we have a better idea of how not to approach it. I don't think veshnyakov is unconscious. Okay, can you elaborate? That toy is a reminder of the guilt he feels about abandoning his son. You mean that the creature now responds to the toy because it has some significant emotional value to veshnyakov? I believe the creature and veshnyakov are now a single entity. They share his mind. It seems to dull his memories and I think it impacts his impersonal skills as well. Every night it spends more and more time exploring outside of his body. It won't be much longer before it shed his body like a cocoon. Something has to be done. We need more resources. We need to take him to Moscow. Moscow? There are many reasons why we decided not to take him there already. We know almost nothing about this creature. If you're right that it's some sort of nymph that's going to continue to grow, we don't know how much bigger it's going to get. It could be massive. I've been asked to destroy this creature should the risk grow to high. And kill an innocent person, a cosmonaut? He's a hero of the Soviet- as a hero, he's prepared for the worst and that includes self-sacrifice. But everyday I send fake reports to Moscow, all to save him. I make things up. What he eats, his vitals, his mood, exercise. If I don't, they will give me the order to destroy him. When they find out, I'll be court marshaled. I was hoping you could help us both. You mind? Dr. rigel? What? Aren't you concerned? = a technical error? Have you noticed that veshnyakov's hormone levels change radically from day to night? At night they seem to get especially bad. I'm trying to figure out why that keeps happening. I'm not an endocrinologist. Do the work, figure it out. You're editing the videotapes. I know that it's eating more than what veshnyakov eats. What do you feed it? Is it pigs? If I'm supposed to investigate, why is it you're hiding this from me? What, you want more? You want my advice? You should go back to Moscow while you still can. Forget everything that you saw here. The review board will destroy us. Do you think the review board cares about hypnosis? I know why you're still here. You want a nobel prize. You won't get much further without me. I'm willing to help you but you need to give me access to everything. I don't have to tell colonel semiradov about this. You're serious? Open the gates. He's clear. You get one chance at this. The battery only lasts for about 10 minutes. Come on. What do you want? What's going on? No! Please, god! Light. Turn off the camera. Yes, sir. Before we brought him here, the creature attacked a medic. You saw it on the video. What you don't see is veshnyakov's vitals. He began to improve significantly after the murder, so we began feeding it whatever we could, starting with lab rats. We even tried pigs. Finally, semiradov decided to try a human, a convict. Veshnyakov got better but you made me start thinking about his hormones. Did you see the way that it behaved? It's not enough for it to kill. It makes sure the victim can see it so they're afraid. The human brain releases significant levels of cortisol when a person is afraid and on this planet when it comes to fear, you can't do much better than people. That's why it's so dangerous because it's feeding on cortisol. This discovery will change the world. If we started to work together- - rigel, you're letting people die. = I'm not. It's semiradov's idea. Do you think I'm a monster? You're no monster, you're a coward. An adaptive and hearty specimen. Go to... you can't stay here any longer. It's a terrible place. They'll kill you. Let's go. I can't, I can't leave. Go to. Listen to me. You're not a robot, you're a human being. Don't you understand? We have to go. Good morning. Morning. I can't leave. I have to stay here. You know, I think I prefer war films. The ones about spice. Go to. How 'bout you? I thought you might like some exercise this morning. How 'bout a run? Go to. Wait. Of course there's plenty of room to run. Just move the TV back. - We have clearance. - We must go to at once. That tracksuit looks good on you. Were you ever in track and field? = no. Maybe we should try it when I get out. We can't compete professionally but there is an amateur league. I need to tell you something. You brought something back from space inside of you. They're feeding it the convicts. I can separate you but someone needs to tell the government what's going on here. Do you hear me? Are they watching you? = not sure. Is there a guard by your door at night? = t don't know. Find out and meet me, one A.M., my block. Sorry, doctor, I'm tired. Good run. Can't sleep either? = you shouldn't be out here. = t remember. It's funny, right? I can go to space, not the hallway. That's irony. Commander veshnyakov, do you think there's anything there beyond the stars? Like what? Anything. Don't you believe in god? = t believe in what I see. Ti didn't see god there. You know what? You should take a break. They gave me a vcr. We should watch a movie together. It'll be fun. I really can't. = come on. I mean it, I'm really not allowed. Thanks to you the entire planet can now breathe clean air again. Come on. What's wrong? I won't leave you. I am still alone. That's not true. I am alone. I was created without a purpose. - You scared me. - Shh. Shh. It's so strange, seeing my whole life laid out like this so clinically. How much of this did you know? = t am that creature. Every time that it kills, it's hunger, every minute detail, it stays with me. We experience it together. If you knew why didn't you tell them? What do you think? If semiradov found out, he would never let me go. My co-pilot, averchenko. You have to help me. Two more weeks, that's all I need. Just pretend nothing has changed. Semiradov won't have a choice. They'll send a review board from Moscow and release us. T don't want to vanish without a trace. Not like him. If we do nothing people will keep on dying. How can you stand it? Ti can't. What would you do instead? Bash your own brains out? Yes, I'm not the one that decided to start feeding it people. You can't hold me responsible for that. I haven't made it this far just to die in the middle of nowhere. T have a mother. She lives alone. I'm all she has. I need to get my son. I see why it chose you. You'll say anything to protect yourself. So that's what you think. 1 see. You're all the same. Doctors like you sit safe behind their desks. I trained years for this flight. I risked my life. And when you don't like the result you tell me I should die. = it's dinner time. Again? What have I told you? You can't do this. Give it here. Did you see? Some kind of animal this one. I don't recognize him. What group is he in? They are invalids. You see his feet? Could swear he's feral. Look, he drew blood. = colonel. = dismissed. Ms. yurevna, I apologize. I wasn't upfront with you. I should have told you everything from the start. Which part? How you feed people to this creature? We're in a race against time to understand this creature so that we might control it. We've done our best to keep it alive, even if our methods are unsavory. You just see it as a weapon, that right? Yes, do you know why weapons are so important to us? Weapons bring peace. The only way to win the conflict is to wield the most powerful weapon on the field. I believe this creature is that weapon. But you still feed it people. People? Sergei genediavich, born in 1952. He was previously convicted under multiple laws for violent assault. He raped and killed his neighbor. She was a 12-year-old girl. They are not people. Real people sacrifice their lives in Angola and Afghanistan. Would it eat them? When the authorities find out they will court marshal you. = hm. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. I'm sure that's inevitable. But as doctors and soldiers, sometimes we have to make difficult decisions. I hope the victory's worth the cost. I assume responsibility, and you do the same. I won't just stand by. Yes, yes you will. Why don't you come see a feeding up close? This time you won't have to use binoculars from your car. Colonel semiradov, I should have told you about her before. - Mm hm. - But I think she understands us better now. Dr. rigel, how do you manage to sleep at night? Me? I know that you let her see how it feeds. You disobeyed me. Right here. Stay down. Just give me time. We can find another way. Time is not a luxury we have right now. Open it. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. It's me. It's me. J a million, million, million Scarlet roses j up above, up above, up above you can see j J who's in love, who's in love [ J a million, million, million Scarlet roses j up above, up above, up above you can see j it's adapted. J who's in love, who's in love [ it can hear her now. J who's in love that you know j j and he'll cover your yard in flowers j just for you j J who's in love, who's in love, who's in love with you now j No! Veshnyakov, can he control it? = no. Not yet. I need results, tatyana. Nothing will change until we can control it, but I doubt that's possible without you. Perhaps you and I, we can set our differences aside and work together for the time being. I will take responsibility. You can tell Moscow that I forced you. All I need is a few more weeks. You agree? = Dr. yurevna. I found out why the creature chose veshnyakov not averchenko. There is tumor on his kidney, early signs of cancer. But he also developed Addison's disease. It was undetected before he left but the creature could tell. Since it prevents his body from producing certain hormones such as cortisol, it was unable to establish a symbiotic bond with him. I'll need metyrapone and trilostane. = trilostane? I can't do this procedure without you and there isn't much time left. Look here. Do you see his tongue? You're better than you think, a tumor. If both of you escape, tell them semiradov made me do it. And if you don't, say I didn't know. Thank you, rigel. You've helped a lot. Are you allergic to buspirone? Me, I don't- stop. What are you doing? You're going to have to decide. Are you coming or not? Keep an eye on the door. We don't have much time so you have to listen to me. The review board isn't coming. Semiradov isn't going to let the creature leave. I think I know how to separate you. Why did you go in there? I could have killed you. Well, you didn't. I guess you like me. This is a mix of hormones. They will mimic a condition that stops you producing cortisol, starving it. After I inject this, the creature will leave your body. It won't survive for more than an hour, but you will as long as I get you to an emergency room. But what if you're wrong? What if it can survive now? We'd just be releasing it. We'll do it once we get away from here. There won't be any people and it's weaker in the light. = no. No. We just have to get to a hospital. I'll think of something. We can do it. = t can't. T can't leave now. T deserve to be here. The creature won't do anything to me. It literally saved me. = that doesn't matter. Just go. = I'm not afraid. But you should be. I'm the one it chose. It's not you. It's my fault. This is my punishment because I left my son. T chose the mission over him. Ti deserve this. Please go. = no. Leosha. What? = his name's leosha Alexi romanov. He's turning seven. It's by the enclosure. = you have to come with us. They'll kill you. I'll manage something. Don't worry. I'm an adaptive and hearty specimen. Thank you. This is rigel from base Alpha four. I need you to connect me to the operative on duty. I have urgent information to share with you. What's this? They're running, veshnyakov and Dr. yurevna. Send in the response team. Do not fire on veshnyakov but she can die. Stay where you are! Veshnyakov step to the right and lay down. Drop any weapons and keep your hands up. = please don't shoot. Open fire. He had their cause of death listed, killed in a fire. Listen to me, both of them were killed outright and there were seven other victims as well as the convicts. Did you? Did you complete the call to Moscow? Ar. Yan, you're no hero. It really doesn't suit you. No matter, I'll make your death quick. Thank you for your years of service. Go down that road. Sir, no sign of them. They couldn't have gotten far. Syringe. They must be back there. Not yet. = just do it. Efervu, go cover the exits. The rest of you, move in slowly. Try not to startle them. = come on. Faster. I think I hear something. = get out of here. Open fire! Hold it men, get out of there! Control! If the fugitives come your way, do whatever it takes to detain them. Stop now! Out of my way! At ease. = konstantin. I'm sorry. What are you doing? Every minute you're getting worse. You'll die without it. But we have to go. You reconsidered, Dr. yurevna. I was wrong. They can't be separated. They're fully symbiotic now. They'll die without each other. I know, I know. We all make mistakes. But I promise, I won't let them die. It's sad the same thing keeps happening. You try your best to save everyone. But it's impossible. In the end, you always have to choose. We did it. There has to be another way to separate you. We'll go to Moscow. It'll be okay. = t know. We'll find a way. They already have. Rostov-on-Don Do I look like I've changed my mind? It's like trying to stop the sun from rising. What do you even need them for? Where do you plan to go? Is there someone you want to see? Go on. At least stay inside the main complex or you'll get me in trouble. = hello. Tatyana yurevna. = hello. = I'm here for leosha romanov. Look at you, making the best of it. I've been working here for 20 years. We all manage. You will be just fine, boy. I'm a girl. My name is tatyana. Are you leosha? My name is Tanya. = hello.
