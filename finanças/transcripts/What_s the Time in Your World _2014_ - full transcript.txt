Road Film Presents Leila Hatami Ali Mosaffa Zahra Hatami Homayoun Payvar Production Designer Editor Christophe Rezai Sound Designing and Mix Sound Recordist Make up Peyman Jafari Production Manager Producer Written and Directed by What's The Time In Your World? Hello, Antoine? I'm calling to tell you I'm going to Iran. Actually, I'm at the airport in Tehran now. It was a last minute decision. Sorry to let you know like this. I promise to keep in touch. Don't worry. Good-bye. - Hello. - Hello. How do you do? I'm Farhad. Excuse me. Don't you recognize me? I'm Farhad... - I must look completely different! - Are the taxis into town here? No, they're over there. Let me help you. The signs are misleading. They used to stop there, but they're all here now. I'm sorry, let me get my handbag! Are you the taxi driver? No, It's me! Farhad the 'Mr. Idiot'. What are you talking about? Well then, welcome to Rasht. She is going to Sagharisazan. How do you know where I'm going? Thank you. It's Mr. Mehraban! Could you stop here, please? Mr. Mehraban! Mr. Mehraban... Hello! I am Goli, Enayat's daughter... Don't you remember me? Gileh-Gol Ebtehaj... I'm your daughter's classmate. I'm Goli. I'm Goli... Enayat's daughter. Goli means flower and you're no flower... You are a thorn. My dearest son is dead because of you! Because of me?! Which son? You only have two daughters... Maryam and Yasmin. Aren't you the kind Mr. Mehraban I once knew? Who's this kind bastard you speak of? What news do you have of Yasmin? I haven't seen her for years... I should get the house keys from Aroos. Doesn't she still live at the end of this street? That cursed Aroos! Go get your key to that ruined house. May God have mercy on Enayat's soul. And on that foul-mouthed Hava, your mother! Mr. Farhad! Have you finished my frame yet? Please forgive me, Bahman... I've been busy these past few days... It's right here... don't worry, I won't forget it. Who's the artist? It's beautiful. Isn't it? It's French. I really need to take French classes with you. Look how shy she is! How do you know she's shy? Maybe the artist was shy! You have amazing taste, sir! One never gets bored looking around here. You know, I didn't choose all of them. People bring things to be framed and never pick them up. Not all are in a hurry like you. Aroos, dear! Please answer the phone. Miss Goli, it's Farhad. Farhad? You remember Farhad, the frame maker. Wasn't he your classmate? Hello... "Dark eyes... "Intense eyes... "Eyes that wait for my arrival... "Eyes that know all my secrets..." I actually thought you might not remember me at all. I am the Farhad who hung around campus... but wasn't a university student. You might remember me later. It's strange. How did you know I was coming? 3 days ago I didn't know myself! Anyway, thanks for your help today. Will we meet again? Yes, definitely. Let me get settled in. Let me know if you ever need anything. Where is the light in this room? It's turned off. I'll tell Abbas to fix these things tomorrow. My father didn't like to say, 'Turn it off'. Instead he would say, "Let that light rest!" This is for you, Aroos dear. You shouldn't have. - It's beautiful! - It's nothing. I came in such a hurry, there wasn't time for shopping. I wish you had come sooner. When your mother was still here. When I was young, Goli's dad came to our house. He had business with my father. When he saw me... he recited a poem written on paper. We didn't know what to do. It wasn't a time for nightingales and poetry! He was nuts, yet amusing. - Will you stop moving around!? - I'm sorry. What difference does it make? You're drawing something else completely. I've drawn something different? Is it bad if I make you look good? No, it's great. We might show it to Goli one day. There was this guy at university... you know him, Ali Yaghuti. He was cold one day and borrowed my coat. Just like you, Goli was drawing him. She said, "What a nice coat! I haven't seen you wear it before. Is it new?" That really angered me. After seeing me in this coat so many times, she didn't recognize it! And then she told him it looked nice! My blood boiled. And you died from jealousy! Oh, my dearest mother! Mother, I love you so much. I miss the sound of your name. What are you doing here? My dear, beautiful Hava... Come here, girl, see how much you weigh. Yes, of course. 78. What! I am barely 55. Exactly 78. You can read this. It's in French! Do you know me? You are Mrs. Ebtehaj's daughter, aren't you? Haven't you just returned from abroad? Your absence has aged these young men. Does everybody know everything around here? Toujours! "If breaking a heart is an art, then an off-key goose can be a diva." What does that mean? Maybe you should fix your scale for next time. Tomorrow I'm a shoe shine man, I bring the scale every other day. How orderly! Is the old bistro still down this way? Yes. Here you are, dear Goli! Thank you... How nice that you remember me. I've been away for more than twenty years. Dear girl, it is much better to remember you... than the aroma of this porridge. My dad used to bring me here often. But this tastes different! It's bland. Have you been to the cemetery? Your dad's tombstone needs tending. It's cracked. I saw it. I can't do anything alone. I'll talk to my aunt about it. You don't deserve to be alone. Couldn't you have brought a French husband home... while your mother was alive? Didn't this have some mint in it? Mint in my porridge? Never! Well, look who's here! Oh, no! Hello. Here you are. What is this? It's for you. It's nothing bad. - How are you, Rahim? - Thank you. With your permission. Do you know him? How strange! "Dark eyes... intense eyes... "Eyes that wait for my arrival." I used to love this song. "Eyes that know all my secrets..." "... that know all my secrets..." "To my dear Gileh-Gol." - Hello! - Hello! I wondered if my "Guardian Angel" knew I was here! Where can I find good smoked fish? Do you need it to make 'Siliodka'? - Yes. - It's this way. Wait... Mr. Farhad! The Farhad who hung around campus but wasn't a student. Farhad the kind-hearted frame maker! Wait a minute! Stop! Was it your doing? What? It was you, wasn't it? Did what? You sent me that photo when I was in Paris? I didn't send anything. I don't even have your Paris address. Wait a minute! Will you write something for me? What should I write? Here! What should I write? Write something here. Go ahead. - What should I write? - Write "To my dear Gileh-Gol". You call yourself, "Dear"?! So don't write, "Dear". I don't like to be tested. So, it was you! What was me? The smoked fish is over here. Thank you very much. I have to go. Don't you want any fish? Yes, I'll take it later. Then you don't want me to come with you? You might as well. Actually, since you know everything about me... then you must remember Ali. Ali Yaghuti. "Ali Yaghuti, make up your mind slowly... Will you choose Fati, or will it be Goli?" I just forgot that one. What are you? A spy? I'm sure that picture made you think of Ali Yaghuti, didn't it? The one where he's holding the umbrella over you. I'm in that picture, too. In the back somewhere. Hamid took it. Hamid Kashi? Really? That's right. Of course! He always had his camera handy. You have a good memory, don't you? It's not bad. Do you know where Ali is now? He's around. But, in the end it was neither Fati nor Goli. Love is the curse of the times. Shall we go? What? It's a gorgeous day, Enayat Khan! Won't you come out? What did you come here for? I want to go to Mohtasham gardens with my friends. He won't go anywhere these days. I'm tired of searching. I'll find it. Aroos! Bring Mr. Farhad some tea. Mother, this is where you wanted it, right? Mother! It's all over when people start calling you 'Mother'. People have names. Here it is, I found it! It was behind the dresser. Bravo, Aroos! Thank God! You've made me happy. Open that window, I can't breathe. - Happy New Year, Grandmother! - Happy New Year, Grandmother! - Happy New Year, children! - Happy New Year, children! Again. Louder please. - Come in quickly. - Come in quickly. - Shut the door. - Shut the door. Where is Mr. Legrand? It's Mr. Najdi. I'll open it! Hello, pretty girl. Hello, Mr. Najdi. Hello, young man! How are you? Fine! Is it ready? - Did I say today? - Today. Yes, I think... How are you? Here you are. Thank you. You're too kind. Are you satisfied, sir? Sorry to rush you, Farhad. It was no problem at all. Let me wrap it for you. No, leave it unwrapped. Are you sure? Leave it unwrapped so I can walk around Rasht with my younger self. I knew it was you. It took you a while. I'm surprised! Good-bye, children! Good-bye, sir! What year was it taken? How strange of you not to ask sooner! May you bless every day... Even though you make a mess, There is no princess who can compare... to you in the dress you wear. I'll rub this sap on my little Gileh-Gol's wart. Goli, go and see your father, sweetie! He hasn't seen you all day. What's wrong? Hello? Are you okay? Are you sure? Aren't you at work? Goli dear? Miss Goli! Please, come in! What memories! God bless Madame Hava! She'll be right here. Have we come at a bad time? Not at all! These are more recent. My nephew Davood took most of these. Please take a look if these are in color. Let me see. - Yes. - Could you set up a projector some night? Of course! But the way you're doing this, it's going to get tangled up. We can watch them together. Look at me! Having such a companion in my old my age! The Honorable Weirdo of Rasht! I'm not from Rasht, I am Russian. Weirdov! Mr. Weirdov! - Stop pulling! - I'm winding it up! Hello, Madam Hava? This is Farhad. Are you feeling better? Hello, Madam Hava... How are you feeling? Hello, Goli. This is Farhad. Hello, Goli. It's me. How kind of them. Every year your gardeners would make marmalade. Your mother loved it. Even though her own jams were the best. I remember Vaji well. The small shy girl. She has three kids of her own now. Hello? "Not with you, not without you!" What? "Not with you, not without you!" This Farhad of yours has completely lost his mind. Was it the frame maker? Surely he was kidding you. Your mother used to say no one knew if he was serious or not. Exactly the type of person I can't stand. What are you saying? Excuse me! I brought you Ali's address. Ali Yaghuti. Didn't you want it? Hey, weirdo! Who gave you permission to stink up the kitchen? I've made some French cheese for you, is that bad? Why shouldn't you eat what your daughter eats a continent away? Aren't you curious? Just imagine this on her breakfast table right now. I'm starting to worry about you. There is a limit to crazy talk! - Why? - What do I care what she's eating right now? What's it to us? What time is it there anyway? Time for breakfast? It's 11:07 here... that makes it 8:37 there. Breakfast time. You are having your breakfast at their time! I just needed a bite of something. You see, I add salt to soak up the water. Listen, young man. Yes. You have romantic qualities... but you don't know how to show them off. I'm showing them off here! Find yourself a true love... and stick to her. Then put your romantic qualities to use. Goli dear, my dearest Goli... Let's go home. It's cold. Your favorite cake is ready. Hello, this is Farhad. I know you're going to see your aunt in Anzali tomorrow. Don't ask how! Ali is also in Anzali. I gave you his address. I just wanted you to know that I will be there, too. It would be nice if we could meet. I have something to give you. If you don't feel up to it... I can wait. I'll wait. What else can I do? Ali! Yes? Please, come in. Don't you recognize me? Sit down, Miss Ebtehaj. What a surprise! When did you get back? How did you find me? By accident? Is that possible? I looked you up. I imagined that you'd have either an art studio or a gallery. What do you do here? It's the family business. Thank you. Thank you. What brought you back? I heard you didn't make it back for your mother's funeral. How long has it been? Five years have passed. Are these your boys? Yes! I also have a daughter, Golnar. She's the eldest. Let me get some tea from next door. So, what's happening in the art world? They say Iranian artists have hit it big there. Well, it depends. We get news from time to time. Painting, Photography, Movies... Ali Yaghuti! - Hello. - Hello. Thank you for coming. I wasn't aware that all of Rasht knows you, except me. Here you are. - Is it for me? - Yes. - You've given me too many gifts! - My pleasure. First it was the painting which I loved... And now this. What is this? It looks like cheese. It is cheese. French cheese! Well, I tried to make it French. You made it yourself?! Years of lessons at the Cheese Institute! What do you mean? It's a cure for homesickness. I thought you might miss Paris. You did a great job! - Really? Can you tell from the smell? - Don't take this the wrong way,... but in my family we use an expression for some people: 'Sweet minded!' Yes, I knew that. It's good that you know everything! I don't know everything. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't be! It's just a piece of paper. Is Hamid Kashi still into photography? No. He's dead! Hamid died? When? In Ordibehesht, 1378. That would be May, 1999. He killed himself... in Tammela, Finland. What's funny about it? Nothing. I don't know why I laugh when I tell people about a death. He shot himself in the head... Just like in the movies. What was Hamid doing in Finland? I don't know. He left like the others... Some went to America or Canada or France or... He went to Finland. Tammela. It's an island in Finland. Poor Hamid! I'll tell you something, don't get upset. I didn't send anything to Paris for you, if that's what you're talking about. I know a few things about you, I don't know everything about the world. So, you didn't send anything? - And you don't know anything! - No! I've only been away for years, I haven't become stupid. Hello? Yes... I'm not home. No, I'll call you when I get back. Yes, I'm fine. Of course! Everything's okay. I'll call you. Good-bye. - I'm sorry. - No worries. For example, I know who that was. Your mother told me. Antoine! Is he still around? Don't say another word! - Just stop talking. - I didn't say anything! You make me sick! I don't feel like playing games! Mind your own business! I'm not playing any games! Just speak calmly. Ask me how I prepared the cheese, or why I dressed like this. Just talk about something else. Why did Hamid kill himself? How can I make you stop bothering me? How can I make you leave me alone? Why send me my mother's picture when I was in mourning? Were you trying to scare me? - What do you have against me? - Nothing! Please stop! What picture? You do ugly things! They aren't cute or funny, just ugly! What happened? Hold on! What happened? What happened? What happened? Is it a nervous tick? Let me see. No, I was joking! - Are you making fun of me? - I didn't want you to go. Were you making fun of me? You idiot! I swear, if you bother me again... If you follow me one more time... - Don't worry, we're friends. - Sure! Right! You're friends. - What are you doing? I told you we're friends! - What are you bothering people for? - Bothering? Will you tell them we're friends? - Lower your voice! Hey Miss. please tell them! Tell them we're friends! Let me go! Get off me! I hope they didn't beat him to a pulp. That's enough now, Goli dear. Calm down! I thought you would cool down in the fresh air. How could I have left him there to be beaten? He's really annoying! He won't leave me alone! He seems more like some crazy stranger than a friend. It was right over there. Anyone can do it. Your mother liked him. She said he was the son she never had. My God! So you know him, too? Here you are, your favorite cake. Everyone knows him! Ever since I got back, everyone wants me to feel guilty. 'Why didn't you come while your mother was still alive?' 'Why don't you have children?' 'Why do you remember this?' 'Why did you forget that?' As if I had so much fun over there that nothing matters anymore. And now this! Auntie, whoever he is, he frightens me. He called the other day and said, "Not with you, not without you!" Oh, that's so sweet. Sweet?! It means, 'Now that we can't be together... we might as well die.' Wouldn't that frighten you? Your mother was right, he has a head on his shoulders. So, why did you suddenly decide to come back? Why did I come back? Why did I come back? Some things don't have just one reason. I thought I'd visit for a while. Like for how long? Are you giving me a Visa?! How should I know? Three weeks, a month... I've come back to my hometown. Does that upset you? Do you want me to go back sooner? Bother me? Have you lost your mind? He was the one who carried your mother's coffin to the graveyard. Do you know how much he cared for her? Fine! The next time I see him, I'll thank him! How interesting! I've never been beat up before. Just my Babushka, my grandmother, would pretend to beat me when she was very angry. Like this. Well. Mr. Legrand is tired today. - Today. - Today. Very good! - He wants to stay home. - He wants to stay home. - Hello. - Hello. Hello, Antoine! Hello, children. Are you well? Mr. Antoine, is it you? When did you arrive? How did you find this place? Perhaps you would prefer if we speak Farsi? Goli taught me a few things. Are you doing well? Mr. Farhad. Would you frame this picture for me, please? Soon. I want to surprise Goli. She doesn't know I'm in Rasht. I don't have the time, monsieur. There is another frame shop on this 'strit'. Another frame shop. We don't say on the 'strit,' Monsieur Farhad! We say on the 'street'. On... The... Street! On the street! Repeat after me, children... - On the street. - On the street. Very good, children. Very good! But, Mr. Teacher, you should work on your pronunciation. It is not good at all. But, this is Goli's book! What's it doing here? Here it is! Gileh-Gol Ebtehaj. This is just what I was looking for. 'Encyclopedia for Children' Soon, you'll receive a PhD in Goli-ology! You are so kind to me! What do you mean by that? I couldn't sleep last night. I wanted to get up and call her to say... ...'Someone here is thinking about you a lot'. There aren't many out there as weird as you. I'm much better now. As a matter of fact, Goli's friends called me 'Mr. Idiot'. - You told me you weren't close to her friends. - I was close friends with Hamid. Hamid the photographer? I knew him. He took my picture without my permission at one of Goli's parties. Then he never showed it to me. I'm certain I looked awful. No, he was like that. He was aloof and distracted. I'd get the picture for you, but he is in Finland. - You haven't tried these sweets. - OK, thank you. You try some too, Madame. I baked them myself. I had some, thank you. Sati always faces away when she tells fortunes. So, tell us about this man's future. His path is clear... His wife and children love him... He is an interesting person, Hava dear. Yes, interesting! It's interesting to be unique at 40. Everyone is a poet in their 20's! So this is the 'Ambulance.' Yes, it's my 'Ambulance.' Who is this? I don't recognize him. It's me when I was a child. - I brought it along for you to see. - That's why I didn't recognize anyone. You were a handsome child, Farhad. And this is my Babushka. - The Babushka you always talk about? - Yes. Babushka! And this is Goli, right? Mr. Farhad. This is your number, right? I'm calling to apologize for the other day. I shouldn't have left you like that. I am very, very, very sorry! Try to understand my situation. It's not easy to meet a stranger who knows so much about you. And along with the news of Hamid's suicide, I lost control. It would be nice to know how you are. That's all. That's all? That's all! You walk too fast, Mr. Abbas. Be careful! You might slip. Is it much farther? Have you been to their graves or not? Have you seen Mr. Farhad? I'm so sorry to have brought you out in this weather. And here she is. - Are you sure it still runs? - It runs faster than I do! You'll see. Get in. If your mother was here, she'd want to go to the orchard. She liked to get everyone to go out in the rain. It's so nice you kept this. Didn't it used to have a small record player here? Yes, many years ago. Then we replaced it with this. We always had music in the car. Mr. Ebtehaj would say... "Now it's raining, and Hava is nostalgic again!" Aroos says my mother called this 'the ambulance'. Because it always took her to the hospital. Especially, at the end. The doctor's office, the pharmacy, the doctor's office, the pharmacy. - Do you know the frame maker's addre... - Shhhh! "There are sweethearts aplenty... "eyes dark and teeth pearly... "but none can compare to you... "Leila dear, Leila dear... "I'll give up my life for you, Leila dear... "Pretty Leila, Leila precious... O' with your green dress... "Clad in tweedy skirts... "Leila dear, Oh dear Leila." Ma'am, is there anything I can do? Thank you, Aroos dear, I can take care of things, you may go. Hello, it's me again. I am just worried, could you answer, please? Just let me know how you're doing. I've already apologized. And then you call yourself a friend! You are aweful if you are hearing this and don't answer. Hello? Hello? This is Goli, how can I help you? Mr. Najdi? Yes, what can I do for you? I remember your family car well. Your mother sat behind the wheel. There weren't many women drivers in Rasht back then. Do you drive in Paris? No, not really! Only if we want to go out of town. With the Monsieur? There used to be an ice-cream shop here. Mr. and Mrs. Ebtehaj would come every afternoon... Hand in hand. Mr. Najdi, please, tell me what you want from me. Was it you who sent something to me in France after my mother's passing? Was it you? Dear child, don't get upset. I would have never asked you to see me, if I knew it would upset you. Well, I have to go check on my tea-field. How far from Rasht is it? Not too far, it's on the road to Lakan. Lakan is quite close, I can give you a lift. How nice! I'll give you some tea to take with you. You need to give it time to steep, 22 minutes. - Who measured so precisely? - I did! There is still one more floor to go. Mr. Najdi, where is your family? Let's just say you are my family. - You mean you never married? - No! Well, kind of. You won't even answer a simple question! Poori said you'd become a little skeptical. Do you know my aunt too? Such acquaintances are normal in our town. They are missed. Who? All the departed. - It's for you. - Oh, this was for me? - And here is your tea. - How nice! When you leave for France, I'll give you more. - If you decide to go back. - Thank you, very much. I was wondering all along what this was. I first saw your mother at a wedding. During the henna ceremony in fact. I was sitting in a room. Hava walked in with a bowl of henna. She shut the window near me. I asked: "Are you cold?" She said, "Cold?! Don't you see there's a storm outside?" Then she sat across from me and smiled. My body went numb. That's when the picture was taken. Hava's reflection is in the window. When she died, I cut it out and sent it to you. So you two had made plans before she married my father? Then they sent me to Europe to study. When I returned, well... you know, Mr. Ebtehaj... I just wanted to see you. To have a picture of you. I wish someone could take a picture of us now. Are you cold? Cold?! Don't you see there's a storm outside? And where am I supposed to find paprika? Still, it was a nice story. Three months ago, I would have asked you why you didn't tell her? But, now I understand. You enjoyed being the one that knew. I'll give you something else you can use in its place. So, what are you preparing for us? It's just Russian 'Borscht'. Nothing too strange. It smells great! I don't think that 'Anton' guy could ever do such things. Antoine. Like that Russian writer. Lovers always end up broken-hearted in his romantic tales. Yes, something like that. But there was no one as crazy as you were. Your story about making clouds was fantastic. I don't believe that anyone was as crazy as I was. I told you that I still don't know. No, I don't have my ticket yet. I'll let you know. I'm scraping off the excess paint from the windows. Why do you say that? Don't say such things! You worry me! He is crazy! Excuse me, Antoine! What are you doing? Come in. Hello. What should I do with you? Are you well? Shall we? Actually, I've come to apologize for keeping you in the dark. It's alright. I was finally able to stand on my head. Well, I used to know how, but needed some practice. - Wasn't it nice? - Yes, very nice! What should I do with you? Come in. Are you going on a trip? No, are you? I'm dizzy. - Do you feel okay? - I just stood on my head too long. I'm just a bit dizzy. It's nothing. What else can you do? Can you do this? It's not that easy! Are your magic tricks in here?! Yes, almost. What was it you didn't want to forget? That day on the pier you put an 'X' on your hand, What was it you didn't want to forget? I don't know. I always do that. You weren't here... I came here often to visit my dear, dear Madame Hava. I'm not a stranger, Goli. I feel like pots and pans are banging in my head. What's wrong? Farhad! Farhad, stop playing games! Farhad! What happened? That's her voice. My name from Goli's throat! I've been afraid all my life. I never paid attention to anything unless it concerned you, Goli. The sound of your name soothed me. You were 'first' and I was 'last', even alphabetically. Ebtehaj, Gileh-Gol; Yervan, Farhad. Strange, I don't remember anything. He's calling on you. Don't you hear? I remember your tastes. Whatever you liked, I liked. I remember that day the teacher asked what we liked about the winter. Crazy Homayoun said, 'Cold milk'. Laleh said, 'Carrot noses on snowmen'. Andre said, 'Snow'. Yasmin said, 'Nothing'. Nahid said, 'The flu'. Ali said, 'The sound of snow'. I said, 'No-school snow days'. You said, 'The smell of orange peel roasting on the heater on a snowy day'. I knew you would say something completely different. You were different, Goli. Why are you lining these up in the yard? At school, we learned that clouds are made from water evaporating. So, I decided to make clouds myself. Then it would snow. School would be called off. Then we'd play in the snow on your street until dark. I knew you would eventually look down from your window. Are you well, Monsieur Legrand? You go to the countryside on holidays. Even on rainy days. To play: I play, you play, he plays... We play, you play, they play. Do you have any news from Goli, Monsieur Legrand? Where is this? Is it your dream? Yes, I've had this dream often... From the time when everyone left. Who's everyone? So, where were you? Were you invisible? What century is this? I don't know what century it is. I just know that always in this dream... you reach your destination, but I get left behind. Your image of Paris is amusing! - I'll carry this! - I'll bring it! - Let go! - No, I'm better now! Please, let go! I'll carry it! Is this your grandfather's suitcase?! Should I call for a doctor? No, I'm fine. I sometimes get like this. Sorry if I scared you. Let me get you something to eat. Don't pass out before I get back! They did sloppy work here. I told them to leave it for me. The cleaning up is fun. It helps you concentrate. You know that I am a painter, too. Then why didn't you paint this yourself? Here, this is good for you. I put some honey in it. Be careful! Thanks. I dreamt of you last night. - Really? - Yes. I don't remember exactly, just that you were in it. Thanks, that makes me happy. My pleasure! That's enough! Let it be. Sorry! So, you used to come here. You told my mother we were friends. I didn't lie to your mother. I told her I was Hamid's friend. How could she have let you in? It's strange. She wasn't one to talk to strangers. I'm not sure. What did you say to each other? Tell me, please! Nothing special. We just talked. What did I say in your dream? I don't remember. Do you have something to say? Say it now! Just now in the yard, on the ground, did I speak? Not really, just some French. It was amusing, and a bit frightening. You are present in all my memories. Like in the stories when someone wakes up after a long, deep sleep. - What? - What? You did say something. I didn't say anything. But you said something. I really didn't. It's Aroos. She left her key behind. She always forgets her key. Hello, Goli dear. I forgot my key. Hello, Aroos. I heard Mr. Farhad walked into your house upside down. Mr. Farhad himself is completely upside down! The whole neighborhood knows. Aroos, when you finish your chores, look for my cell phone. - Okay. Sure! - I think it's in my father's room. "Who is he who colors your face... "with hopes and fears... "And knows all your games... "Who is he?" "Who is he who gifts your soul... "with the wine of Spring..." What was that? It was so beautiful. "What was that? It was so beautiful." "Why won't it rewind?" "Goli! What did you do?" "Oh, no! I think I pushed the wrong button." What was that? Was that my voice? I had brought this for you all to listen to. It was also your friends' voices. I could never find that song again. Instead, your voice stayed with me all these years. "What was that? It was so beautiful. Why won't it rewind? "Oh, no! I think I pushed the wrong button." Where did you get these? My book! What is this boat? That's mine. These glasses... This encyclopedia... Where did you get these? My alarm clock! Everyone thought it was running slow... Why did you keep these things all this time? These were my happy things, Goli. They didn't make me sad. - Where are you going? - I'm going to wash my glass. Leaving them unwashed brings bad luck. But if you wash them your guests might come back. So, are guests always supposed to come back? Let me pour you a cup of tea. This was steeping for longer than 22 minutes. 22 minutes? How precise! I didn't know. Finally, something you didn't know! Thanks. Why are you looking at me like that? How am I looking at you? I didn't know my mother had a talent for painting. Is it raining? For a while now. How nice, it's the drizzling rain I love so much. Whenever it rained like this my father would call me to say... "Daughter dear, it's raining the way you love." But, it rains a lot in your Paris! That's just rain, this we call 'Varesh'. It's not the same thing. One is missing. There used to be 20. There was a song I always used to sing. I had forgotten one of the lines. The 'X' on my hand, since you know everything, was to ask about that line. Then that terrible thing happened... It's interesting you noticed the 'X' that day. Yes, this is 'Varesh'. It's different from rain. Well... I guess I should go now. Forgive me, Goli... I'm exhausted. I need to rest here a bit. Before the horses come for me. I can see you are exhausted. Sleep, 'Mr. Idiot'. It was worth it. What's The Time In Your World?
