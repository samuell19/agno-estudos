KABUL, AFGHANISTAN Legend - Athens - Legend - BethRockefeller - Review - willy_br - 17 YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF TALIBAN, AFGHANISTAN IS STILL ONE OF THE WORST PLACES IN THE WORLD TO BE A GIRL. MANY WOMEN ARE NEVER TEACHED TO READ. GIRLS GET MARRIED EARLY. FOR MANY, VIOLENCE IS A THREAT IN AND OUT OF THE HOME. HIDDEN BEHIND HIGH WALLS, IN SOME KABUL PLACE THERE IS A PROGRAM THAT SEES POOR CHILDREN AND SUPPORTS THEM TO ENTER THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. We are a war-torn country. Our country has been at war for many decades. In Afghanistan, things are not very good. Everyone is always in danger on the streets. The society we live in it is not safe at all. Especially for girls. The girls arrived. Hello! Hello! What is courage? Courage is when someone goes to school and studies... and when we read the Qur'an and other books. Great. Let's clap for her! Why is courage important? You answer for us. We need courage to learn to read. Great! - And for public speaking. - Very well! - Do you understand? - Yes. What happens to our rights when we don't have the courage? They take it away! They take our rights, and never return them. Did anyone have any doubts? No! Raise your hand if you understand. - You understood? - Yes, I understood. You did not understand? See? She didn't raise her hand because she doesn't have the courage. Even though she understood the lesson, she didn't have the courage to raise her hand. Now, get up. Narges, dear... how can we get our rights? Say, "Reading the Qur'an." Going to school. Very well! By going to school and learning, we guarantee our rights. And we also gained courage. Do you understand, dear? We teach children from poor places and from the streets who didn't start at school before. Here it is safe for girls to learn. And we teach them to skate. LEARNING TO SKATE SKATE IN A WAR ZONE IF YOU ARE A GIRL SKATEBOARD SCHOOL AND SKATEBOARD SPRING PERIOD FIRST WEEK OF CLASS I work for my students, to make their lives better, because once, my life was like theirs. Now, store your books carefully. Hey, these are my shoes! Give them back! Give it to me. HANIFA SKATEBOARDING INSTRUCTOR Silence. Girls, silence! Okay, girls. Are you okay? - Yes! - How are you, teacher? - Did you get here safely? - Yes! LESSON 1 STANDING ON SKATEBOARD What is the first lesson of skateboarding? First, the five standing positions. So, hold it. FRIENDS Okay, put the skateboard on the floor. Put your foot up now. No, the other foot. Put your foot in the center. - A! - A... Two. Put your feet slowly. Do not stir too much. - Three. - Three... Four... Five. Very good! Now, give me your hands. Before Skateistão I did nothing. I was sitting at home with my brother. I cleaned the house and washed the dishes. We cleaned the garden. I took my brother out to play. My brother and I sold gum on the streets when I was seven. And when I turned eight, I came to Skateistão. Okay, listen. Teacher, there are no chairs left. Teacher, listen! Teacher! You are noisy! Class, let's review the lesson from last week. Everyone, read aloud from the board. Teacher, none of us can read or write... Don't worry, you will learn. Take the life skills book. Right. The book asks: "What do you think before you do something?" Here's an example. The boy broke his neighbor's window. Right? Who here knows what a slingshot is? Have you all used a slingshot? So you know. I also had one when I was a kid. Slings are made with two sticks and a strap tied in the middle. You put a rock and shoot at things. Slingshots are not for breaking windows. It is not a good deed. It's wrong. My name is Treena. I teach life skills and math in Skateistão. I love sports. And I love working with children. It is my decision not to want to show my face in the film. How do I write this? I work with children. I am their teacher. I don't need to appear on the cameras. The students, some of them have problems at home, like: they don't have a father, or maybe their mom or dad is disabled. And they are poor. Sometimes they are from places like... very conservative families... closed-minded and strict. They do not encourage their daughters for life. How do I write this? For example, there are families who say their daughters they should never be heard. If they grow up in a very strict family, they repress themselves and fail to make friends. They suffer. We are eight sisters, and one brother. With my mom and dad, we are a total of eleven. Is it the oldest or the youngest of your sisters? Three of them are older than me. Do they come to Skateistan? No. They are not authorized. Why are they not authorized, but you are? Because where I live is a tradition that when a girl grows up, she shouldn't leave the house. If a girl leaves, everyone says: "Oh, my God! That girl left." Girls older than me don't leave the house. How old are your sisters? One is 18, another is 16, and another is 13. - I'm 12. - Doesn't 13 come out anymore? Do not. I do not want to grow up, so that I can skate forever. SUMMER PERIOD A few days ago, my mom told me not to come here because there could be explosions. She said, "Don't go." But I said, "I will". I had already missed school a few days. FATIMA SCHOOL SOCIAL ASSISTANT Can you hear me? When you pick up the kids, tell them to be at the side of the road. Yes bye. Part of my job as a school social worker is to recruit new students. I usually focus on neighborhoods where the poorest and underprivileged people live. Without a school bus it would be very difficult. Boys could go to school, but girls could not. It is very difficult for girls. There are many dangers, harassment on the streets and even kidnapping. It is a problem for their family. They think, "If I send my daughter to school something can happen to her on the way. " They get scared. Some families have enemies that threaten them. And if you have enemies, girls are more targeted than boys. In Afghanistan, kidnap a girl dishonor her whole family. Rinse. Put it there. Is good. She's always asking me to let her sew, but I don't want her to destroy other people's clothes. Otherwise, I will have to pay for them. - So I won't let you sew. - No! - Do not hit me! - Sit down. Do not do it. - Stop it! - Get him out! Get up and get him out of here! Take him. Get him out of here. Did you go to school? No, we didn't go to school. There was a war and we became refugees. I was beautiful when I was young, so they married us. It was too late for me. They need to learn. We are without study, and we know nothing. They need to be better. I want to keep everything organized. Let me take care of him, he's out of control. Go, go! Get out of here! Many families are afraid to send their daughters to school. But I have seen cases where families have been very hostile. But I approach them like a man, without fear. Some families went against girls to skate, because they can get hurt. And our culture does not tolerate families who let girls skate. I told them that it is not good for women to stay at home. Education is mandatory. God said that seeking knowledge is a duty of all the faithful. That's how I managed to convince them. Because I am a brave woman myself. I'm not afraid of anyone except God. So far, 30 people have lost their lives. Approximately 400 people were injured. While the recreated Taliban has become more radical. But this type of attack only shows how Kabul remains vulnerable. Taliban says that this attack in Kabul today is just another... When the explosion happened, I was at school teaching. RAZIA PERSIAN AND MATHEMATICS TEACHER I thought someone had thrown a stone at the window. The glass broke. No one was hurt, but it was terrifying. Everyone was scared. We tried to calm the children, they were very afraid. We told them that everything was going to be okay. "It is far away, it is probably an earthquake." But they knew from the loud sound that it was an explosion. They were laughing, and saying, "Do you think we're stupid?" They live in this society. They are aware of all these problems. They listen on the radio and on TV. They see it on their own. They know that. Hurry up! Drink and get out! It's already good! Go! Sit over there. Fatima! Sit over there. - Give me a piece of bread. - Mom? Come here! Oji, come here. Come here not to choke. Come here and sit with me. Sit down... Don't give it to him. I want you to know that he is a legitimate Afghan. - He's going to get sick. - Legitimate Afghan! Are you going to make him sick to show that he's an Afghan? I have a better idea. Come here, for you to feed me and I to feed you. Those days are over. I got married at 14 years old. Now I'm 35. Thirty five years. Did you go to school? No. Things were different at the time. Schools in Afghanistan have been closed because of the war. We didn't have a chance. But these two they will finish school and university. Then you can think about marriage. Not now, it's early. I won't know what to do when the two get married. I don't want that to happen. They are the main livelihood of the family. Their father is very old. He is no longer able to work. These two are like my children. We will do the tic-tac going in zigzag. Tic-tac zigzagging the cones. Do you understand? LESSON 3 - TIC-TAC OR HOW TO CONTROL THE SKATEBOARD - Do you know the tic-tac? - Yes. The other foot. The next one! Slower! Jameel! Orange! Jameel took an orange. Come on. Read. Jameel... Orange. Jameel took an orange. In our country... Wait, say the letter. Amira! What is our lyrics today? - "J"! - Great! Jameel took an orange. In our country, there are orange trees. Orange or orange trees? - Orange trees. - Very well. Teacher, choose me! Me! Me! Click, free skate, and push. You always bump into me! The students like to come to the front of the room. That's why, even without knowing the answer, they raise their hands. I always say to them, "It's okay. Even if you don't know the answer, raise your hands. " "Coming to the blackboard gives them courage." "If you only know a part, will learn the other on the blackboard. " That is why they are not afraid. "Daddy". When I'm at the skate park, I don't feel like a lazy student anymore. I feel like I've become smart. I’m very happy skating on the ramp, and I do it well, and other people see it. It makes me very happy. LESSON 4 SKATING ON RAMP To skate on the ramps, it is important not to be afraid. We can't think that we will fall or end up hurting ourselves. Are you afraid to fall? Yes... Right! When we are on the ramp, put a foot on the side and the other foot is behind. And we put our weight forward. And then we started like that. You go first. Are you alright? Go get her skateboard. You can sit on mine. I will hold your hands. Do not Cry. Come to the queue. Do not Cry anymore. You do not need to cry. Hold on to me, even if you think you know how to do it. Get your homework, please. Teacher, I got it! What did you do with your book? You need to be a little more organized. Teacher, she is teasing me. Be quiet! A big truck bomb exploded, as a consequence killing at least 90 people, and more than 400 of them were injured, many of them seriously, in the worst attack since last July. The truck bomb exploded near the German embassy, in the fortified diplomatic area of ​​the city, considered the safest place in the Afghan capital, at least until this morning. There were always explosions, at least once a week. Now they happen all the time. We were afraid. If Skateistan didn't exist, I would have to sell tea on the street to support my family. And now it would be very bad to work on the streets. If the Taliban comes back to power, we will be forced to wear burqas again, forced to stay at home. Schools will be closed and children's lives, ruined. They killed women who didn't follow their dress code. We had to cover ourselves. They would go after you, if they found a TV, a phone, or a movie at your home, or if your children did not go to prayers in mosques. They came at night and knocked on your door and asked why their son didn’t go to night prayer. They punished their parents too. It was a terrible time for the people of Afghanistan. We lived in Wazir-Akbar-Khan. I had my 3 year old daughter in my arms. I had no scarf on my head and I opened the door to go buy yogurt. Suddenly, a Taliban came and asked why my head was bare. I said, "I have a husband, and it's not you." "You don't rule me." He hit me with a whip, and I slapped him. He said he was not afraid of him and his peers. But then, they all had to wear burqas. I saw horrible things. May the winds of Kabul never touch their faces again! FINAL PERIOD Form pairs. Come here, please, and stay behind him. Go. Come on, girls. Don't be delicate! Those who are fragile should not come to Skateistão. This place is for tough people. She fell! Girls, get out of the way! Look at her! Someone put a big eye on me! Of course there is fear. This is Afghanistan, and there is always a suicide attack somewhere. We are afraid, but we leave the house because we have to leave the house. We deliver our destiny to Allah. Right. What subject will we learn about now? What is the subject of the article? - Sadness! - Sadness, teacher! Do you know what the emotions are? The feeling of joy and sadness. Show me how a person looks when you're sad. Up front. Someone who is sad. Think about it. You are always laughing and happy, right? Today you are sad! How do you demonstrate this? You are laughing. Shut up! Again, now seriously. Very well. You can go now! You were great! When someone in your family or in your class is sad and you want to cheer her up, what do you do? How do you do? Teacher, I will tell them, "Don't be sad." They will say, "No, go away!" But I will not go. Now let's practice this. You swallowed a 5 rupee coin - and now he's sad. - Yeah, I'm sad now. This happened even to her in real life. Show how sad you were. And she wants to cheer you up. Show how you felt the moment you swallowed. I was sad... How did you feel? Show me. My eyes were popping out! Show us. Don't talk, just show. Why are you upset? Because I swallowed my coin and now I'm upset. Do not be sad. Do not worry. In the end, she will leave. Don't laugh! That poor child really swallowed money. We trust our students' ability to learn, and their willingness to learn. If we work with them, and families support them, and they keep coming to school, they will build a better future. I want to be a pilot... if you allow me. Eye doctor... because then I can fix eyes. Teacher. I want to be like Professor Shogofa, like Professor Hanifa, and like Professor Treena. I want to be a journalist, newscaster. I got married young because I had no choice, but my daughters can become doctors, engineers, pilots. My daughters have a choice. So, can you tell me a joke? Once upon a time there was a girl and her grandmother. The girl was beautiful and delicate, like you. They went to a store and asked the price of 1 meter of fabric. The seller said, "One meter costs a kiss." The girl said, "Okay. I want 10 meters, and my grandmother will pay you.
