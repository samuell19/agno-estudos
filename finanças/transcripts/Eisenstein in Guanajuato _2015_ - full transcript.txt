Eisenstein had a worldwide fame based on the reputation of only three films, all made in Soviet Russia. Strike,a violent tale of civilian unrest viciously crushed by authority, The Battleship Potemkin, a violent account of a naval mutiny over rotten meat. and October, a violent celebration of the Russian Revolution. ﹝glass shattering﹞ In the West. the film Qctober. was called Ten Days That Shook The World.

Well, when they chopped my Hollywood contract, I couldn't go back to Moscow empty-handed. And I d met the film-director Flaherty, who made Nanook of The North, and he got me interested in going to Mexico, which I must admit wasn't difficult. Well, Flaherty makes films with people who are not actors, like me. with people who are not actors, like me. And he convinced me I could make a film independently in Mexico without actors. And when I was in Hollywood... and I was lonely... and miserable... and miserable... and homesick... I spent a great deal of time in the Hollywood bookstore and practically bought up their entire stock of books on Mexico. The owner of the bookstore. who had fought in the Mexican Civil War, who had fought in the Mexican Civil War, said I could make a film in Mexico for $25.000. And I talked to Chaplin, and he agreed it was a good idea. Mexico is fashionable amongst all Chaplin's left-wing friends in California. They all have second homes here.

Von Stroheim shot 100 miles on Greed. It is normal to shoot that much, and we have a project here covering the whole of Mexico. We are not at all doing badly, considering all the language difficulties, the extras that don't turn up or turn up too late, the Mexican authorities who, out of the blue, when we are all prepared, deny us permission, the exceptional heat that is making everyone sick, then--then the heavy rains, not known for 20 years, and then I fall sick with some mystery disease that no one can find a name for, even in Aztec. And what about this letter that Upton sent to the Russians in America. saying that the hacienda story's the only one that makes a film that anyone could understand in Hollywood and that the rest is just aimless pretty pictures? Upton does not simply understand that the film needs to be edited the right way. - Well, he says the rushes are the same thing over and over again. - Jesus! That's the way you make a film, god damn it! Where have you been? We keep shooting till we get it right. Not every single retake is in the goddamn film! He said, anyway, at the end of his letter that he was convinced that it would be a beautiful and magnificent work of art. - And--and look what he wrote to Stalin. " Dear Stalin... " . - You don t address the Premier of the USSR like that. - Upton did, and he s a writer. " You may have heard "that I have taken the job of financing a moving picture, "which the Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein " is making in Mexico. "It is going to be extraordinary work " and I think will be a revelation " of the moving-picture art. " Someday you will see the picture "which Eisenstein is making " and realize that Soviet technique " has advanced another step and been crowned with fresh laurels. " - Well, I'm not sure what else he wrote in that letter, but he must have provoked Stalin somehow, because this is what he telegrammed back to your husband. " Eisenstein lose his comrade confidence in Soviet Union. " Stop. He is thought to be a deserter "who broke off with his own country. Stop. "I'm afraid the people here "would have no interest in him. Stop. " I m very sorry, but all assert it is the fact. Stop. My regards, Stalin." - How did you get hold of a private telegram from Stalin to my husband? - Well, from those very people who apparently have no interest in me. So who's lying? - And my husband wrote back at once. saying he had never, ever thought you were a deserter and had never been disloyal and that you were ferociously attacked by the American rednecks in California and that you stood firm in your principles and had every intention of returning when the film was completed. - There are so many contradictions flying around to your advantage, it is hard to believe that you want us to succeed. - And I wonder what you have not contributed to all these contradictions. You have been nothing but trouble from the moment we started. Even on the train leaving Los Angeles, you get into a fight with the brother of the Mexican Chief of Police. - Well, we weren't to know who he was! He was ravishing some woman on my couchette! - Ha! With nights under hotel arrest until Sinclair phoned Chaplin to persuade them to release you. - Well, see how popular we are. In the end. we had 12 American senators. Douglas Fairbanks, and Albert Einstein rooting for us. And the Mexican President apologized. - What about that business with the young man stealing your gun and shooting his sister? - That was an unhappy accident, which you well know. And it wasn't my gun. This troublemaker, your brother, is being very far from helpful. His poor, not to say, bad management, and his not knowing anything about film production has wasted hundreds of dollars that we could do well with. He has presented me to your husband as a liar and a blackmailer and God knows what else. It is impossible to work under such an ignorant tyrant. What the hell does he know about film production? He's just a stockbroker salesman from the provincial South. You have to get him off my back. I wouldn't be at all surprised... -Señor! - If he was spending the film money on women, drink, and gambling.
