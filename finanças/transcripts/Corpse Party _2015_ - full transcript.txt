Come on guys, let's finish cleaning up Oi Shinozaki, whatcha doing? It's a surprise! Just wait. Why not? I can help you with the count. Aw! You made me mess up some of the good parts. You just need a few so we can go home. We all want to go home. It's Suzumoto's last day here. Transferring, huh... It's going to be a lot less lively without her. Oh oh oh! Earlier today you two looked good together! It's nothing! Good friends! Oh, what is it? It's a secret! Tell me. Sources - Talk about what relationship thing - no What happened to the lights? Eh, nothing. A power outage. I'll be right back. Ayumi well done! Is that from the haunted house props from the class next door? There! It's not so terrible now is it? Still is, I feel creeped out. Because Ayumi is the ultimate horror story school girl. The girl who loves telling ghost stories. Speaking of which, there is one thing we should all do together. Eh? What? Sachiko happily everafter. In our academy, when the moon is full. It is said that before the academy was built, there was a cursed school called Heavenly Host Elementary. There is a school nurse who fell down the stairs and died. Some time later, 3 students were kidnapped and 2 of them were found murdered. One student remains missing to this day. (Corpse Party) The missing student is Sachiko That does not sound happy. Is there any happiness in being missing So that is the story of Sachiko-chan AH! Sensei don't scare us like that! It's your own fault, you scared yourself. Scary Well this is how not to pack. Sorry, we'll finish packing now. It's raining hard in a hurry so get to work. Okay Brother! Yuka That's right. She came to bring your umbrella. Thank you Wow! So cute! Oh! You're really Mochida's little sister right? What do you mean by that? Yuka has come, so hurry and pack it in. Wait, the story's not finished yet! No more ghost stories. This story also follows friends! Sachiko is Kisaragi Academy's patron saint. I heard about this Sachiko charm, with the right incantations She will bless us forever and we'll never part. So we pray together Suzumoto-san, this is so we will always be friends, even though you're transferring. Shinozaki-san... Very good, then we'll do this together. Shinozaki's occult fantasy hobby sometimes comes in handy. It's not fantasy if it's true. Nice to know you really can keep us together. Now then, I'll explain how to do the "Sachiko Happily Everafter" charm. We seize this paper Sachiko doll evenly, chant the words, "Sachiko-san, if you please" You say the incantation exactly by the number of head count There are 9 people, so chant 9 times and then we tear the paper doll when we finish. It is said that as long as we have our scarps of paper, We will not be separated I will surely treasure this scrap of paper. Let's get started. Close your eyes. 1 2 3 say together... Sachiko-san, if you please. Tear together I will not forget everyone! What's happening? Satoshi! Naomi! Naomi, is that you? Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? No It hurts Where did that earthquake come from? Seiko! Naomi... Brother! Yuka! You okay? How did we end up here? This is not our classroom. Open! Is this some sort of joke? The door opened. Stay together everyone. Where are we? What's the situation? Damnit! - Here- You can't move them, they won't budge - Keep trying. Yui Sensei Over there Is anyone here? That can't be right... Shinozaki What's up? -Tenjin Elementary School- No dial tone. Can't get through. TV only has static. Damnit! Hey, take a look at this. (Sachiko Happily Everafter Charm) (Tenjin Elementary-Main floor-Staff room) These have to be fake, right? Could these be manuscripts? (Kibiki Kou) Who is that? Mystery Occult novelist Kibiki Kou-Sensei. He is an occultist that solves and writes about supernatural events. A famous psychic person in the occult Why is this person's manuscript here? Because there is something here that he wanted to write about. Once the "Sachiko Happily Everafter" incantation has been done Those involved get lost in a dimension seperated from ours And that lost dimension... is Tenjin Elementary.The school where children in the serial murder occurred The resentment of the murdered children formed... That's here he's-! Don't you think that I've already figured that out? (A series of missing children) (Girl's whereabouts still unknown) Children in the city lost in a series of disappearances The aftermath ends in a gruesome and unspeakable tragedy. Kanno Yuki, Tsuji Tokiko... The two children's bodies have been found But Shinozaki Sachiko is still unaccounted for The "Sachiko Happily Everafter" story turned out to be true... Rest assured everyone, no ones there. Owie... Naomi, you okay? D-Dead body Don't look at it! Seiko! Please don't leave me! I apologize, I won't leave you! Yuka, I found you. Brother Thank god! You're okay. Let's go find everyone else. Sorry, I gotta go to the bathroom. I'll be here waiting for you. The cultural festival Yuka! Yuka! Yuka! (Tenjin Primary Reference Room, 3rd Floor, Main Building) Shit! Why won't they open! Tenjin elementary school janitor Yanagi Hori Is likely to be one of the perpetrators in the grusome murders He is the guy from before Children were found to have their tongues removed. Tongue. As in tongue? Reading that is not going to help us escape this place. Wait. Reversal incantation If we do the reversal incantation for "Sachiko Happily EverAfter" we can escape. Is that the reverse incantation? How could this be! What is it? A page is missing. Ah, What the hell. (Tenjin primary health center, 2nd Floor Main Building) There. Bandage is all set. Utter perfection! Right Naomi... If I confess that I love you, You would reject me Besides, Naomi's favorite is Mochida-kun Oh no. Your Student Handbook went missing. It probably slipped out of your pocket when you fell. Satoshi The handbook now holds something that Naomi cherishes. Hey, slow down. Kishinama-kun, you're not coming with me. I must go, even if I go alone. Why go to the janitors lounge? The killer is not just the janitor! This is very dangerous! But there may be clues... No. You can't just waltz in there recklessly! Please, let me go. Do you not see the corpses all around us? They got that way somehow. In short, it's very dangerous! I think the "Sachikio Happily Everafter" charm brought us here. I suggested that everyone get involved in it. I will not let this become a tragedy for us. Kishinima-kun, go find everyone alright? Sorry. Well, I have a friend right here. So wait, I'm coming with you. Let's see what can be used as a weapon Nakashima's Student Handbook. What's that? Is something the matter? It's nothing. It's not your fault. Thanks... Come Seiko? Seiko? Ouch... Huh, a pendant. Seiko? Ah, why am I so unlucky! Did something happen? Why is your face so pale? Let's return to the Nurse's office. You'd better get some rest. Don't touch me! Where were you? You left me! Did something happen to you? You've been acting strangely since I got back. The problem is with you! Always smiling.. Like everything is going to be okay. No need to get angry... I want to live too! I don't mind people such as you, but here it's sickening! I'm Just trying to be considerate... Do not come near me, you're sick! Go to hell. Die. Die. Die. This is... Also...oh... Rest assured you are with your big sister now. We will get along nicely. So there is no need to worry. Suzumoto Those are the two children that were killed in the serial murders... Ah! Shinozaki-san, Kishinima-kun Suzumoto-san, no get away! Don't look them in the eyes! They said to find something. Oh yeah, have you seen Shige-ni? Morishige, he's also worried about you. We gotta get out of here fast. Shige-ni... but I cannot leave these kids no matter what. Big sister will also help find what you're looking for together. Suzumoto... Shinozaki! Seiko... Why... Why... Yuka... Who's there? Naomi! Hey, you okay? Naomi! - Satoshi... - What happened. Seiko, she ... she died. How? I said horrible things to her. I'm the one to blame. But I never thought...she would commit suicide! Stay calm! We can't stay here, it's too dangerous Sprained ankle still painful huh. Quickly We need to find a place to look at your foot I'm sorry No need to apologize. How did this one happen? Amazing... Unfortunately, this abnormal situation can't bring salvation to others... This one is in pieces, all are parts of the human body. amazing...amazing... Mayu! Are you alright? Shige-ni... I'm worried about you! Where are you? Don't look at me... so .. .. Do not look at my .. .. .. insides... Don't look... Don't look ... Don't look...Don't look,don't look, look,look,look,look (Tenjin primary school- janitors Annex 2- floor lounge) Okay We must hurry to save everyone How do we do that? I do not know yet Tenjin Primary School seized evidence of spirit activity. Maybe there will be a way to get out of here if we watch that tape. But no VCR... The staff room. Suzumoto turned on a TV in there when we first came here. There was a camera right next to it. The worst thing is, is that he just walks! What is that? Those children are looking for something. I think I just found out what that is. Brother! Oh, that's Mochida's sister... And it seems he got separated from you right? Let's you and I find him... Escape is useless! You must've been very lonely Mayu...If you let me take pictures of it! Now! Ouch! Yoshiki! I'm sorry I didn't know it was you, that was an accident. Ah, Ah, I'm alright. Mochida-kun! You're okay, what a relief! -Are you alright?- Yeah, Satoshi hits like a wimp. When you go for a hit, swing from the waist. You get more power to your hit that way. Long-winded baffoon... If you two have nothing nice to say, then shut it! (Tenjin elementary Main floor staff room) This is so surreal! If we do not find Yuka... Yoshiki, can I entrust the two of them with you? But you know you might be tangling with a very dangerous person, right? Wait! I'll go with you. But you're still hurt. I want to be with you. Alright then. Wait! There's more! Yuka-chan must be alright. What do you mean? The children liked Suzumoto-san. They would certainly like well behaved, sweet children like Yuka-chan. But you told us that those child spirits killed Suzumoto-san... That is because Kishinuma-san and I tried to take Suzumoto-san away from them. - Because you said to...- What makes you think it'll be okay, why should we help them? Also that man killed Sensei! What exactly are you getting at? This tape. It may have the answers we need,those child spirits may have the key to escape this place. I think the first key point is to find out. Then we go together and find Yuka! - But... - Please! Alone, then it is certain that we will fail. So give us a hand. Satoshi... Alright then. Great, absolutely amazing. Kibiki-Sensei. Kibiki-Sensei, are we really here? Tenjin Elementary School-Ah Awesome! Calm Down! I did not expect to really come to this place. We can still go back right? As long as we have the reversal incatantion, we will be able to return to our original dimension and all will be okay. Reverse incantation. I want to record all of this hidden dimension. I want this footage to shock and awe the world over. Prepare the camera. Got it. In this room is a strong magnetic pulse, indicating a strong spiritual presence. Find a good spot to place it. The next one is found in the music room. I can feel a very strong magnetic field. It seems that there are others that have been summoned by the "Sachikio Happily Everafter" charm. Why was the tongue cut out? Huh? Who are you? A survivor. Hey you... Hey, you there. Excuse me... Wait a minute... It is a...! Oh shit! Reverse incantaion failed. The resentment of the child spirits is too strong. Two of my compainions have been slain. I am the only one left .. Therefore, I cannot continue the reverse. The inverse method absolutely cannot go wrong. I would like to ask of whoever finds and watches this video... Please bring salvation to the murdered children. End this curse! Kibiki-Sensei was... Getting out of here really is impossible! Shit! Satoshi. That piece of paper... Here it is! People that have their Sachiko paper pieces... To invert the charm, take the number of people present, plus Sachiko... Shout out the previous incantation.Then put the pieces together. Never use other debris. But the salvation of the children... They cannot hear the inverse incantation So before we can do the inverse incantation, we must bring them salvation. Satoshi, How can you stay so strong through all this... I will definitely go back with Yuka. She has always been protected by me. We also will be able to go back alive! Yes, we'll do what we need to, or die trying! Naomi what's wrong? My piece is gone. I put in my student handbook. But it seems that it fell out somewhere. Quick. Look for it. Satoshi, what do I do? Don't worry, it'll be okay. We'll figure out something. I won't leave you behind. Nakajima-san, use this. that is... When Suzumoto-san died, I picked this up. why didn't you... I didn't want to say anything, but I picked this up to remember Mayu. You... Thank you so much Shinozaki-san! I will never forget everyone... So I can go back too. Then, now what? To discover the bodies in the music room, this has to go back to where it belongs. Are those...tongues? That the killer cut off? Those kids are looking for something. And I am pretty sure that these are it. Cruel Right, let's go to the music room. I'm sorry! You go do what you can. I'm worried about Yuka... And I have to find Morishige. Then, I'll also go with Satoshi. We'll find Yuka and Morishige and then immediately meet back here. Sounds like a plan, we'll go to the music room. Be sure to get back here alive. (Tenjin Primary School-Principal's office- Building Annex 2) The safest place here is in the Principal's office. Thank you. I hope Brother's okay. I think so. You really think so? Sachiko knows. Big sister, you sleep a little and I'll watch over you. But... If your big brother comes, then I will wake you up. Is this.... Hold on a second! The children should have killed three people... There are only two. Hear me out... I'm here to save you. Shinozaki! - My tongue - There it is. Stop all the suffering and the misery. It has been enough, it will all be alright soon. Please, I'm begging you. Thank you, Big sister. So you can go back to where you belong. - What's the matter? - Why haven't they ascended? I thought with their salvation, we could finally fight back and return home. Please, tell me. Please! It hurts...It hurts so much! Mommy's all alone, so I am giving you to her. In hell. No!!!! Are you okay? Oi! Why? What happened? What did you see? The real perpetrator of the murders...The one who killed the children, was Sachiko. Then what about the janitor? He was just forced to assist in her crime. We need to find Sachiko and find out the truth, otherwise these children won't be able to ascend. Don't go, it's safe here. But if we don't make things right, Sachiko will kill Mochida. What are you saying? Mochida is looking for Sachiko! Why is Satoshi so important to you? What is he to you? I do not want you to die and Satoshi hasNakajima with him. I'm going. Fine. Do what you want then! Sachiko-chan? Nakajima-san, here use this. I picked this up when Suzumoto-san died. Now there is no way she can go back. My brother's umbrella... Big brother, big brother...I'm sick and tired of your whining. I guess mommy will still want you. no!!!.... no!!! Stop moving! Yuka-chan! You're okay. You're alright... Kishinuma-kun! This is what happens when you leave me behind. Damn it!! No!! No!! Kishinuma-kun Do not die... Kishinuma-kun ... Yuka!.... Yuka!! That one is... Yuka held my umbrella. Big Brother, Big Brother. WAIT!!! Satoshi! Satoshi! Yuka! Satoshi... (Tenjin Primary Screening Room, 3rd Floor, Main Building) This is Kibiki Kou-Sensei's ghost capture camera... Please! Save me! Help me please! Why are you making me beg? Why would you do such a thing? no...stop. I beg of you, don't do this! No don't! I ... I killed Seiko. I want you to die die die... Why... Why... Why... Seiko. (Sorry to leave you alone) (And please forgive me) Seiko...Seiko. I'm so sorry. (Naomi's cherished thing. Naomi's cherished thing. Naomi's cherished thing.) Seiko. Seiko. Satoshi. Seiko, watch over me. (Tenjin primary health center, 2nd Floor Main Building) Do not die. You definitely must live so you and Mochida can be together. I was not able to ascend and can only linger in the health center. Sachiko ordered for me not to be lonely. The children she killed, she sent here to keep me company. This is all my fault. Hurry to the dark basement, there you will find what remains of Sachiko. You're still alive. Ah, but obviously you've found out you killed your friend. Now die! Naomi I'm Okay. It seems this is what protected me. I picked this up at the health center. Stop it, you don't want to do this... You are not very bright. Obviously, you lacked obedience. You don't listen to me. Then you have the gall not to die. Principal... Mommy, what happened? What a pity. You could have still had a long future. What a shame. No, not my Sachiko...Sachiko. Ah, it does not look like an accident. Sachiko... Are you alright? I saw it. The curse from the very beginning with Sachiko. Sachiko and her mother was murdered, resentment from that generated this curse. So I must help Sachiko or this curse will always exist. What exactly are you saying? We need to find Sachiko's body. Sachiko was murdered in front of these stairs, then taken into that basement. Let's end it. Naomi The Sachiko paper doll piece, do you still have it? Why do you ask? In order not to lose it, I can help you keep it. Why do you want to hold on to it? Do not ask why, just hand it over okay? Thank you. No problem, let's go. Mom... Mom... You are already dead! But you appear every night in my dreams! Stop! Stop it! Cut out her tongue! I cannot do it! Hurry, so she will shut up! I am sorry... Liu is the son of Hori so do as I say! Sorry! Sorry! I have given you all that you have and you still stand against me!? Sachiko... Mochida-kun. Yuka! Yuka? Yuka!!! Yuka... Yuka..Yuka..-Yuka-chan Let go... Stop! We want to help you! You killed them! You killed everyone! Satoshi! Stop! Stop it! Even if you are not happy doing this brings no happiness to your mom! She will be pleased Wrong! "Sachiko killed the children and brought them to me." "Stop it Sachiko I do not want this!" Lies. Here, remember... Sachiko... Mommy... What? Perhaps Sachiko's resentment was relieved and since the curse was lifted, this dimension is starting to collapse! Let's get out of here! Come Snap out of it, Satoshi! Let's go back. Hurry! This way! Naomi! One more step to go! Come on! Come on, in here! The Inverse incatation! Can we really go back now? Satoshi. Start with the count of us present, and a fourth time for Sachiko. Then put the torn pieces together right after. Got it? Understood. Let's get back to our world. Sachiko-san, if you please! Sachiko-san, if you please! Satoshi, we're back! Why?
