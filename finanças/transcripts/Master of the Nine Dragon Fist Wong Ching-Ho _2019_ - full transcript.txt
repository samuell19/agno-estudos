Since the 18th century the British East India Company has been steadily shipping opium into China in order to counter the trade imbalance. Guangzhou bore the brunt of it. The number of opium addicts soared and innumerable families were broken up. Driven by righteousness, martial artists Wong Ching-ho and Wong Yoke-kei mobilised the masses to destroy opium dens and put opium to flames. While this went down well with the commonfolk it angered the unscrupulous British traders. Bravo! James, British trader Mun Sing, pugilist from the north Sir, may I ask where all the martial arts schools in Guangzhou converge? How do I get there? You have to ask? You aren't local, are you? I'm from Shandong. I heard martial arts schools are aplenty here. I'm hoping to earn a living here. Earn a living? Go past this new town and you'll reach the old town. That's where the martial arts schools are. Thank you. Let's go, dear. Come on. Yes, even the rulers don't care. Why the hell is he doing this? Shit! Wong Ching-ho! I've dealt with those foreigners before. They won't give up so easily. They might conspire with the local officials to make our lives impossible. They could be doing that as we speak. Even so, Master Wong this affects the fate of our country. We must stand our ground. We can only take each day as it comes. No, I cannot arrest Wong Ching-ho. Commander Choy. He's the ringleader of those troublemakers. If you don't arrest him who knows what he will do next. We have our goods to think of. Wong Ching-ho is a hero to the locals for his campaign against opium. We will incur the wrath of the people if we were to lay a finger on him. If I'm ousted from my position you can forget about selling another ounce of opium in Guangzhou. Besides, Wong Ching-ho is backed by a bunch of fearless pugilists. Antagonise them and you'll be losing much more than just money. Your Excellency. Those foreigners won't be able to handle Wong Ching-ho and Wong Yoke-kei. This is a lucrative business. The capital has issued a directive. The imperial court is going to clamp down on opium smuggling. At a time like this only the strongest will be able to weather the onslaught. What do we do? Are we going to ship the opium that has reached the harbour back to England? No way. I won't let them get their way. The Chinese are not so united. The commander wants us to fix the problem, doesn't he? Well, I have a plan. I'm going to kill that bunch of pugilists. But what happens after that will be up to me, and not him. This way, please. Ching-ho, everyone is waiting inside. Greetings to all of you. - Master Wong. - Master Wong. Gentlemen. I got you here today to discuss setting up opium treatment centres and forming patrol squads. I hope to have your support. Let's work together to get this done. Take a seat. - You're all show and no substance! - What? - You heard me! - What did you say? Your kungfu is all show and no substance! I dare you to say that again! You just prance around like a fop. Yes, we're talking about you. We'll set up the first treatment centre at my school. As for the patrol squads I'll leave that to you, Master Wong. Bad news, Master. Senior got in a fight with the people from Xiongwei. What? Master Wong, I'll be right back. Let's go! Master Wong, I'll take my leave. I didn't mean to hurt you! Let's go! They went that way. After them! Let's go take a look. - Stop! - Stop it! What's going on over here? They took over our training ground and said practising Hung Fist makes us all brawn and no brains. - What happened? - What? Since when is that your training ground? Master, they started it by calling us all show and no substance. They said we prance around like fops! That way. Hurry! - There they are. - Stop! Stop right there! - Stop! - Stop right there! Stop right there! Stop right there! Over there! Let's not fight. I don't want to hurt you. I said, stop! Just fight back! Stop giving in! Get him! Let's go! - Stop right there! - Stop! - Stop right there! - Stop! Stop right there! Stop! Stop right there! - Stop right there! - Stop! Master, there's a Northerner wreaking havoc! None of us are his match. Let's go! We're all show and no substance? We prance around like fops? Make way! Hurry. Make way! Hurry. Stand back. I'm glad you're here, sir. Your disciples... How dare you wreak havoc in Guangdong? You're asking for this! So that's Hung Fist? I'm not impressed. Let me show you... a proper duel. Master, are you all right? Let's go. - He's running away. - After him! Quit pushing! Come on. Are you happy now? Why did you have to stick your nose in? That man needed help. Besides, I'm a martial arts practitioner. I couldn't just watch and do nothing. Father, I'm hungry. We'll go and have a good meal. I have my money right here. Where's my money? The Iron Shield skill? I'm sure of it. He didn't even bat an eyelid when I hit him. It's an incredibly hard skill to master. Those who do master the skill are practically invincible. Master Yim, are you certain that man was up to no good? Of course I am. We've exchanged blows. Besides, this is Guangdong. Who's that country bumpkin to be encroaching on our turf! I've instructed my disciples to beat him up every time they see him. He's not making Guangzhou his home. Is this all you have? How much more do you want? I had to ask Master Wong for a six-month advance. Clear your gambling debts and don't come here looking for me again. - Get out... - Tin-meng! Boss... Get lost if you can't pay for a room! That's common sense. What else is there to say? I was careless and lost my money but I swear I'll find a job tomorrow and pay you back double. We'll talk again when you've found a job. Boss... I've chased him away, Master Yim. Let's try another inn. Someone will sympathise with our plight. Is he cold? It's your fault if he is! What did I do in my previous life to be saddled with a useless busybody for a husband! Let's go. Looking for the money you lost? Someone from Yim's Martial Arts School took it. I saw what happened. You're a highly skilled pugilist. It must have taken great restraint to not fight back. I'm interested in Chinese martial arts and I'm keen on learning the skill. Would it be possible for you to teach me? Sorry. I don't make friends with foreigners. I hear you're the ones selling opium. You're scum. My friend. You've made an enemy of the locals today. James, looks like he still won't cooperate with you. He'll definitely come around. The Chinese are stupid and selfish. Tell those guys we paid off to start more fights. Yes... over there. It's more eye-catching here. - Be careful. - On the double! Yes, just put it there. This will do. Leave it here. - Master. - Got everything ready? Yes. Look, Master. What do you think? Opium Treatment Centre Get out... Give me a chance! I can even work for free! I just need food and lodging. Go back to wherever you came from! You don't belong here! Get lost! I'll find work as a coolie. Once I've saved up enough money we'll go back to Shandong. Hey, have you heard? He's trying to make a living here after he has made himself the public enemy. These country bumpkins have no brains. Have you heard? Master Wong's setting up - An opium treatment centre. - Really? - Let's go take a look. - Yeah, let's go. Fellow countrymen. Opium has infiltrated Guangdong for decades now. We have all seen the damage it wreaks. As the saying goes, to err is human. To repent, divine. I will do my utmost to help all opium addicts who wish to kick the habit. Master Wong, how much will it cost? We're doing this for the greater good. It won't cost you a single cent. - Everyone... - Master Wong! Bad news, Master Wong! They're fighting! Calm down and tell me what's going on. A fight broke out among several of the martial arts schools. Tin-meng, I'll leave this to you. - Take me there. - Yes, sir. What's going on? - Something's up. - There's a fight? They're causing a public commotion and the innocent is getting hurt. To think they proposed forming patrol squads to maintain law and order. Your Excellency. Now you have every reason to arrest them. Guards. No. It isn't time yet. If you act now you'll only be arresting the small fry. To rid ourselves of all obstacles we need to get rid of Wong Ching-ho. Hold off for now. I'll need to engage help. Help? Stop it! What's going on here? Why don't you ask him? He picked a fight with me. - So my master stepped in. - Nonsense! He accused my disciple of seeking payback for what happened yesterday. But he couldn't prove it. And then he insulted us. You're just a second-rate fighter. Stop showing off already. Remember how you got thrashed yesterday? How dare you! Gentlemen, nothing warrants a fight in public. Look how scared the commonfolk is. They've done nothing to deserve this! Slowly... be careful. Easy now, don't damage the goods. Be careful. - Mister, can you... - What's with you two? Give me a chance, mister. I have a wife and son to feed. - I need a job. - Watch it! I'm strong. Be careful. You can't afford to damage any of it. Am I not strong enough for you or are you worried I'll eat you broke? Both. Most importantly we're not hiring. We're not hiring northern clodhoppers who came with their families in tow. - What did you say? - What do you want? You're in Guangdong now. I have my backers. Country bumpkin! All right... no more for you. Too much wine is bad for you. If you don't mind we can always come here again. So what if I'm a Northerner? So what if I'm from the countryside? What are they so cocky about? I'm a better fighter than any of them. They even stole my money. Despicable scum! This is what those hateful narrow-minded folks do. They gang up on outsiders. Master Mun, I can solve your money troubles. To be honest with you I've been looking for a business partner. Are you able to defeat all the martial artists in Guangzhou? Can you be the top pugilist in Guangzhou? If you can do that I'll set up the biggest martial arts school in Guangzhou for you. I promise you'll be rolling in money. Here, have some tea. - You mean it? - I'm a man of my word. A reconciliation dinner? If the martial artists aren't united we can forget about forming patrol squads. I'm afraid martial arts practitioners like us have become the scourge of the people. Tin-meng. Yes, Master. How is it going at the opium treatment centre? We have people coming in to seek help but not many. That's to be expected. There's stigma attached to opium addiction. Tin-meng. Keep our patients' identities protected. These folks want to mend their ways. We must keep their reputations intact. Don't worry, Master. The patients are quartered at the very back of our school. They won't be seen by the public. I want to take a look. Yes, Master. Let me out... I want to get out of here! Let me out... It isn't easy to kick the habit. Patience is key. We have to make sure they don't sneak out for another hit. This is killing me! Tin-meng. I have a prescription here. Keep it with you. It's a special formulation to help the addicts kick the habit. Get the prescription filled. I will. Let me out... My wife is pregnant. I have my hands full. I'll need you to take charge here. Yes, Master. Don't worry. - Good. - Let me out. I want to get out of here! Let me out... Tin-meng. Why are you here again? Master Wong, where is everyone else? Ching-ho. I'm wondering the same thing myself. Stay away from me... Master! I concede defeat. Here... you can have your money back. You're the better pugilist. Will that do? It's that Northerner again. This is the fourth school he's been to. The masters have all capitulated. - Master! - Looks like this is the end for Master Yim's martial arts school. Master Wong! What is it? More infighting? No, it's someone else this time. It's that Northerner. He's shutting the schools down! Who are you? Wong Ching-ho of Guangzhou. So you're Wong Ching-ho the master of dragon fist. Just the man I'm looking for. I'm all for a round of friendly sparring. But why are you going around shutting down martial arts schools? You're asking me for a reason? None of you gave me a reason when you ganged up on me! Stop! I heard what you said. So you're going to challenge every martial arts school in Guangzhou? That's right! I want the world to know in a fair duel no one in Guangdong is my match. Bring it on. We're not afraid. Very well. I accept the challenge. But if you lose please leave Guangzhou. That's what I want to hear. Tomorrow at noon. I'll be waiting. Be careful. Don't worry. This is not my first duel. I'll buy a sea bass and cook your favourite dish. It should be ready when you get back. Sure. Here's your tea. What is it, Tin-meng? My brother came by again yesterday. He wanted you to take him as your disciple. But don't you worry. I've turned him down. It's a good thing he wishes to learn martial arts. But you know I don't take gamblers to be my disciples. Tell him to come to me after he quits gambling. All right. Thank you, Master. You may go. Don't worry. I'll be back in time for dinner. All right. I'll get going. Wait home for me. I will. Come home early. "Guangzhou's top pugilist." "The invincible Iron Shield"? I can't believe his arrogance! The duel hasn't even been fought. Master Wong isn't afraid of him. But what if Wong Ching-ho loses to him? Shut up! Ching-ho, you're going to be late. Guangzhou's Top Pugilist The Invincible Iron Shield If Wong Ching-ho has gotten cold feet I will go to him! What's going on? Let's go. - Thank you. - Wong Ching-ho! I thought you chickened out. So here you are. Master Mun, pardon my tardiness. It's all right. Let's have our duel here. Ching-ho, he has mastered the Iron Shield. You need to tread carefully. I'll buy time to find his Achilles heel. James, this doesn't look good. Will he really be able to beat the guy? This way. Look at this. And this. Thank you. Nanny, let's get a sea bass. Sure. Let's take a look over there. There are more stalls up ahead. Let's take a look. - Take a look. - Take a look. I'll take this. Here you go, Mrs Wong. Is this to celebrate Master Wong's victory? We don't know if he'll win. It's Master Wong we're talking about. No way he'll lose to that Northerner. Make way! Make way! Master... Master! Mrs Wong was knocked down by a cart! What? Watch out! Wong Ching-ho! You were distracted. That wasn't a fair win for me. We'll have a rematch when your wife is well. What do we do? I smell a rat... James. That fool. It happened before we could react. The cart was bearing down on us. Those scoundrels knocked her down and took off. Thank god for Tin-meng's brother. He helped me with Mrs Wong. I wouldn't know what to do if he hadn't been there. Thank you. You're welcome, Master Wong. You've been so good to my brother. It's only right I reciprocate the favour. Master Wong. I'm jobless right now. May I stick around... Master, is she all right? - Is the baby... - You may all go. I'd like to be alone with Yok-wan. Sure. Tin-meng. Tidy a room for your brother. He can stay and help out for the time being. Yes, Master. Go now. Let's go. Yok-wan, how do you feel? What do we do now? Even Wong Ching-ho has been defeated. There's no one left to bring that country bumpkin to heel. Master Wong. There wasn't a clear winner. How can you say Wong Ching-ho had lost? Wong Ching-ho might very well trounce that arrogant pup in the rematch. Please calm down. I'll discuss the rematch with Ching-ho. I want to revisit the issue of forming patrol squads. What do you think if... There's no way I'll work with Cheung. Master Wong. Wong Ching-ho was the one who proposed forming patrol squads. If he's not doing it, why should we? I have things to take care of. I'll take my leave. Master Yim... I don't want to work with you either! Master Cheung. It's better to end the enmity than keep it alive. Mr James. Is this house really for us? Of course. I made Master Mun a promise. Once he is Guangzhou's top pugilist I'll set up a martial arts school for him. The least I can do is provide a roof over your heads so he can focus on his task at hand. What's wrong with you? Don't be rude. Mr James, my husband is a boor. Please pardon his uncouth behaviour. Bring our son outside. Fine... I'll do as you say. You call the shots now. Stay on his good side. Why did you bring my wife and son here? Why? Don't you like this house? Is it not big enough? Did you send someone to attack Wong Ching-ho's wife during the duel? What if I did? And what if I didn't? Does it matter? Of course it does! If you instigated that incident this partnership is over. Master Mun, don't forget what they made you promise. If Wong Ching-ho defeats you you'll have to leave Guangzhou. Think about it. Imagine slinking back to Shandong with your tail tucked between your legs. Does it sound like a promising future to you? Your wife and son will have to starve again. But you can relax. I have nothing to do with that incident. I had every faith you'd win the duel But I have to say, I'm a little worried now. Now that he has gone one round with you Wong Ching-ho knows how you fight. Could this be his ploy? This is too much of a coincidence. I smell a rat. Yes. I feel the same way. It's too much of a coincidence that Yok-wan met with an accident during your duel. But he's a Northerner. He has neither kith nor kin here. Who could he have gotten to engineer the accident? I can't be sure. Too many names come to mind. Master Wong, how is everyone? Your near-defeat has shaken their faith. They are reluctant to set up patrol squads. Everyone's only looking out for themselves now. If you want to rally everyone you must win in the rematch. The Iron Shield skill isn't as unassailable as its name suggests. Each practitioner will have an Achilles heel. To defeat him I need to find his Achilles heel. When I fought with him this afternoon he was very protective of his sternum area. I think that's where his Achilles heel is. Before you take him on again we need to figure out how you can neutralise his kicks and focus your attacks on his sternum. I don't know how we can do that with the little we know about his moves. Ching-ho. I'll spar with you using his moves while you try to figure out a way to get past his defences. Ching-ho. Thank you for enlightening me. Is it almost time for your duel? There's still time. Don't worry. In order to counter his moves I've created the Nine Dragon Fist with Master Wong's help. The Nine Dragon Fist? I created it based on Dragon Fist. There are nine moves altogether. Namely, Swimming Dragon, Whirling Dragon, Trapping Dragon, Whipping Dragon, Sinking Dragon, Coiling Dragon, Splitting Dragon, Intertwining Dragon and Flying Dragon. These moves aren't fully developed but it should be enough to defeat him. I know you can do it. What a shame I can't be there. I'd love for our child to see how his father makes a name for himself using the Nine Dragon Fist. Tin-leung, what are you doing here? I got Master Wong's tea ready. Let's go then. Tin-meng, you needn't go out today. Stay home and look after my wife. Yes, Master. Master Wong. What's keeping Wong Ching-ho? He's not getting cold feet, is he? You know Ching-ho better than that. It isn't time yet. Just wait a while more. Ching-ho will put Guangzhou on the map after today's duel. Master Wong is here... Master Wong is here... - Ching-ho. - Greetings, Master Wong. Greetings, everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting, Master Mun. Is your wife feeling better? Thank you for your concern. She's much better now. Good. We'll have a fight on equal terms this time. Bravo! Make way! Make way! Hurry! Hurry! Make way! You countered my every move and adapted to the unexpected. I'm impressed. You came up with a set of new moves in such a short time. I'm impressed too. Make way... What are you doing? What's this about? - What's going on? - What are you doing? What are you doing? What do you want? We have an order to search your premises. How dare you resist! Arrest them all! What are you doing? Tin-meng! Mrs Wong! Ching-ho, watch it! Bide your time! Make way. Master Wong? Ching-ho... - Master Wong... - Ching-ho, what's wrong? What are the constables doing here? What? Ching-ho! He took his own concoction of herbs which contains opium. That's impossible. It's a concoction that gives the user a boost of energy followed by what you see now. I can't believe he stooped so low just to win the duel. That's utter nonsense! My husband will never do that! Yok-wan! Ching-ho. Possession of opium and resisting arrest. Arrest him! Arrest him! Stop! Yok-wan... Yok-wan! Enough! Get him out of here! - Yok-wan! - Master, we have to go! Yok-wan! Make way! Run... hurry! After him! Run, Master Wong! How dare you! Run, Master Wong! - Run! - Run, Master Wong! Dragon Fist Martial Arts School Wanted: Wong Ching-ho That's impossible. Master Wong would never do that. They must have made a mistake. What can we do to help? Master, it's time for your medicine. Commander Choy. I got you here today not just to celebrate. Oh? I had a deal with Master Mun. I promised to set up a big martial arts school for him if he proves himself the best pugilist in Guangzhou. Now that Master Mun has defeated Wong Ching-ho it's time I make good on my promise. Mr James, you're a man of your word. Commander Choy. I've already found the perfect spot for Master Mun's school. But I'll need your help to open a martial arts school here. Surely, you jest. We both know how well-to-do you are. I'm sure you can buy any place that catches your fancy. I want Wong Ching-ho's martial arts school. But James... Commander Choy. We must open the school there to get the message across loud and clear. That's going to be tricky. You know we've just seized his martial arts school. It won't look good if we were to turn around and give it to Master Mun. That's right, Commander Choy. Have you done a proper investigation? Was Wong Ching-ho really under the influence of opium? But that makes no sense. His new set of moves weren't fully developed but it's powerful enough for him to take me on. - He didn't need to... - Mun Sing! Watch your mouth! Master Mun, I can explain that. Wong Ching-ho didn't have enough time to fully develop his moves and that's why he resorted to taking opium. He's a hypocrite who would do anything to retain his position as Guangzhou's best pugilist. Besides, we found opium in his martial arts school. We have irrefutable evidence. He's most definitely guilty. It has been days. Master is still refusing to take his medicine. All he does is stare at Mrs Wong's memorial tablet. He refuses to drink or eat. He hasn't uttered a single word. Master Wong, what do we do now? He can't go on without food or water for much longer. You're such an idiot. What were you going on about at the dinner? Mr James was being nice to you. Stop fixating on Wong Ching-ho. You need to learn to hold your tongue. Wong Ching-ho might have gotten away but after that debacle his anti-opium campaign is all but dead in the water. We finally got rid of that thorn in our side but now, Mun Sing is getting in the way. Why don't we... The next consignment of opium will be here in three days. Although we've smashed Wong Ching-ho's coalition there might be other fools who try to stand in our way. We need a new place to stash the opium. The safest place in Guangzhou to do that would be in Mun Sing's school. But why insist on Wong Ching-ho's place for Mun Sing's school? James. You've gotten rid of Wong Ching-ho. - You needn't... - My goal isn't to bring down Wong Ching-ho. What I want is for all the pugilists in Guangzhou to bow down to us. Only then can we rule over this place. Master, someone sent you an invite. Heroes Inn. The day after tomorrow. What is it, Master Wong? A storm is brewing. Tin-meng. I'll go with you to see your master tomorrow. If that doesn't work I'd have to ask my master for help. Memorial tablet of Lei Yok-wan Master, Master Wong is here to see you. Leave. I wish to be alone. Master... Just go! Ching-ho, I'll go after I say my piece. I know you're devastated by your wife's tragic death. But you can't go on like this. Don't you want to clear your name? Don't you want your wife to be able to rest in peace? The events of the past few days are too much to be a coincidence. Each time you duelled with Mun Sing something would crop up. Your wife is dead and you're a wanted criminal. The pugilistic scene in Guangzhou has been turned upside down. Mun Sing is setting up a martial arts school amidst this chaos. Doesn't this mess reek of conspiracy? Ching-ho, don't you want to get to the bottom of it? Don't you want to avenge your wife's death? Memorial tablet of Lei Yok-wan Thank you, Master Wong. You say my master is still not himself? But, Master Wong... my master has pulled himself together and he's practising martial arts again. But he is still hurting inside. His punches are full of hostility and his moves, ferocious and rigid. If this goes on he'll be engulfed by hatred and end up doing something foolish. What should we do then? Don't worry, Tin-meng. I've got someone to enlighten him. Go back for now. I have a meeting with Commander Choy. Yes, Master Wong. Dragon Fist Martial Arts School Put the ladder here. - Careful now... - Get up there. Careful now... you hear me? Hurry up and get it done. Mun's Martial Arts School - Make sure it's level. - Is this all right? Make sure it's all dusted and cleaned. Get firecrackers and the drums ready for tomorrow. You hear me? Yes! Isn't he the one who got Master Wong into trouble? - Hurry. - Master Wong lost everything because of him. Now he's taking over his martial arts school. It's that country bumpkin. That Northerner is too much. He's in cahoots with those foreigners. Come with me! So what if I'm working for Mun Sing now? I have to eat too! Master Mun has taken me as his first disciple. What did you say? Why? You don't believe me? Think about it. If it wasn't for me... could my master have beaten Wong Ching-ho? You're nothing more than a bunch of idiots to James. Tin-leung, what are you doing here? Master Wong's tea is ready. - Who are you? - What's going on? - Let him go! - Are you all right? Here, get up. Good moves. Put more effort into it and you'd be able to set up your own sect. It's a pity you're blinded by hatred. You were so desperate to win every move you made was aimed to kill. Without any control or forethought. There was no flow among the nine moves. No harmony. Young man. The way you're fighting right now... you'd have lost to yourself even before your opponent defeats you. You're blinded by hatred. You were so desperate to win every move your made was aimed to kill. Without any control or forethought. There was no flow among the nine moves. No harmony. The way you're fighting right now... you'd have lost to yourself even before your opponent defeats you. Swimming Dragon Whirling Dragon Sinking Dragon Whipping Dragon Splitting Dragon Coiling Dragon Intertwining Dragon Flying Dragon Nine Dragon Fist. Excellent. You're a quick study. I see why my disciple, Yoke-kei regards you as his best friend. Wong Ching-ho. You've mastered the Nine Dragon Fist and moved past the hatred that poisoned your soul. You're now free to do what you want. Was that Master Wong's mentor... Master Hey Choy? I won't let you or Master Wong down. What? Master Wong's martial arts school has been given to that Northerner? It was seized yesterday and today it's the Northerner's? It looks like... What other reason could there be? He's in cahoots with the officials. Does he think he can ride roughshod over all of us? Where are you going, Master? Calm down. This doesn't concern us. It doesn't concern us? If one of us falls, we all fall. They're walking all over us now. Of course it concerns us! But you can't do this single-handedly. I'm not alone! Wong Ching-ho isn't here - But we still have Wong Yoke-kei. - But... No, there's more to this than meets the eye. But Master Wong, they're... It's never wise to clash head-on with the officials. We know they have the officials on their side. We'd only be courting trouble if we openly challenge them. Let's see what they're up to tonight. What is it, Tin-meng? What is it? Get up and we'll talk. Master... I'm so sorry. - Greetings, Commander Choy. - Greetings. Everyone's here. Here... sit down. Please take a seat. Please sit. Well, as the saying goes a good fight can turn foes into friends. I know there have been misunderstandings between my master and everyone here. Tonight I, Ho Tin-leung, will like to make a toast to everyone on behalf of my master. From now on we'll look out for one another and get along. What do you say? Commander Choy... You have all been led astray by Wong Ching-ho. Look at all the trouble you've caused. The streets of Guangzhou were in constant pandemonium. Are you going to keep that up? Here. Drink this and pay Master Mun a visit at his martial arts school tomorrow. Promise to co-exist in harmony and I'll close an eye to what you've done. Refuse and I'll have all of you arrested for rioting. That carries the same sentence as mutiny. Here... shall we? Here... I'm glad you see the light. Bottoms up! Here... Get up. Don't beat yourself up over it. What you said makes sense. I did wonder if the tea was spiked. You said your brother mentioned James. So you probably got one thing wrong. Mun Sing isn't the one behind all of this. Mr James. We've moved all the goods in. Guard the goods with your life. Don't worry, I will. Mun's Martial Arts School Congratulations... Congratulations! This way, please... This way, please. Thank you... Congratulations. Thank you... this way, please. Thank you, everyone! Yok-wan, I won't be long. Let's go. Memorial tablet of Lei Yok-wan - Master Mun... - Thank you... - Master Mun... - Thank you... Commander Choy. Thank you all for coming. Please take a seat. Please. Greetings to you, Master. Listen up. We have a Northerner setting up a martial arts school in Guangzhou so what's a Westerner learning kungfu from Master Mun? That's right. I've always been interested in Chinese martial arts. That's why I'm here to learn the skills. Master Mun. Please take me as your disciple. James. Don't stand on ceremony with me. Please have a seat. Henceforth, James is my disciple. Anyone who harasses him when he has done no wrong will have me to contend with! Excellent. Master Mun is a man who takes charge. You're the man to lead the pugilists of Guangzhou back onto the right path. Planting evidence. Opium trafficking. Can a man like him lead the pugilists onto the right path? Hu? - Wong Ching-ho! - Wong Ching-ho... Guards! Arrest him. Just a moment! Who are you accusing of planting evidence? Who do you think? - If not for my traitorous brother... - You! you'd never have defeated Master Wong. You're twisting the truth! Wong Ching-ho took opium so he could win... James! So it really was you! Master Wong. You're a hero, I respect you. If you can defeat me I'll shut my school down. And you can have the place back. Bravo! Bravo! - Bravo! - Bravo! What is going on? I hear Master Wong has challenged - The Northerner to another duel. - Really? Did you hear that? Let's take a look. Bravo! Master Mun, you're a worthy adversary. Commander Choy. What are you doing? Wong Ching-ho, you trafficked opium under the pretext of setting up an opium treatment centre. We have concrete evidence of your crime. You're not getting away today. Arrest him! So you're accusing me of trafficking opium? Master Mun. Do you know what's stashed away on your school premises? Commander Choy. I dare you to send your men to search his martial arts school right now. Gentlemen. There has been much infighting amongst us of late. What is the cause? Who has been sowing discord among us? Master Cheung. Why don't you ask your disciple? Out with it! Who is it? It's James. James made me do it! Get lost! You went to such lengths just so you could smuggle opium into China unimpeded. I'm telling you now. While we Chinese are affable to all we will not tolerate despicable miscreants like you! Watch out! Master Mun! Master Mun. Master Wong... I was duped. I have done you wrong. But I'm still a Chinese. Master Mun. So what if you can fight well? You're no match for our guns. You will bow down to our firearms one day. Wong Ching-ho. You've nowhere to run. Surrender now. Forget about arresting him. I'll send him to meet his Maker. - Ching-ho! - Master! What do you think you're doing? Our flesh and bone may be no match against your guns. But... Even if you mow us down to the last man... As long as one of us still stands... We will not allow foreigners to violate our homeland! Don't come any closer or I'll shoot. This is an open rebellion! Guards! Arrest them! Hold it! The anti-opium envoy appointed by His Majesty is here. No one is to move an inch! Imperial Commissioner Lin Ze-xu? I had no idea Your Excellency is here. Pardon me for not receiving you. You're an official of the court. Your duty is to serve and protect our fellow countrymen. Instead, you collude with the foreigners and wanted our comrades killed just to keep your vile deeds a secret. How do you explain yourself? You're mistaken, Your Excellency. Wong Ching-ho and his comrades incited the masses to rebel. Mr James opened fire only to help us round up the rebels. We were not trying to silence anyone. Is that so now? But I hear you're conspiring with the foreigners to traffic opium and murder innocent countrymen! What happened here is of your own making! Commissioner Lin. Please mind your choice of words. I'm a simple trader. I know nothing about the opium. You have no right to be flinging such accusations at me. He's lying, Your Excellency. His opium is hidden in a martial arts school. Conduct a search and you'll see. Everyone here can testify to it. I will conduct a thorough investigation. I'm here on His Majesty's order to crackdown on the trafficking of opium into our country. But, Mr James... the charges of opium trafficking aside I saw you shoot one of my fellow countrymen dead. You can't argue your way out of that. The laws of Great Qing dictate that you pay for murder with your life. Ching-ho, you do it. With the help from Wong Ching-ho and the pugilists of Guangzhou, the anti-opium campaign in Guangzhou gained traction. On the 3rd of June 1839 Lin Ze-xu ordered a large-scale destruction of opium at Humen Beach. The act went down in history as the Destruction of Opium at Humen. Translator: SPECTRA MEDIA
