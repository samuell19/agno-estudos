Gwen, you were marvelous. - Oh, thank you very much. This performance is going to make you one of the biggest box office attractions in the world, Gwen. Do you really think so? Can we have a statement for our paper, miss Taylor? Oh, I'm so very grateful to everyone who's helped me and especially to Dusty Turner, my manager. Thank you. - Thank you, miss Turner. Yes, oh, hello, Mr. Grauman. You were marvelous tonight. Never more glamorous. - Oh, thank you... One of the greatest performances I've ever seen at the Chinese theater. - Thank you, Sid. You know, I've reserved a slab of concrete. May I have your footprints? Certainly, she'll do that. Thank you, Mr. Grauman. - Oh, it's wonderful, and remember, when you take your feet out of that wet concrete, keep them on solid ground where they have always been. She'll do that too, Sid, and I'll send you a bill for the shoes. Thanks a lot. Yeah. Well, listen after tonight, she's the hottest thing in pictures. Yeah... and that's not only what I think. That's what the audience told me. Huh? Well, that's a little better. Now you're getting warmer. All right, all right. I'll see you at 11 o'clock in the morning. And listen, Frank, practice up saying big numbers will you? Goodbye, now. Hey, Gwen, are you dressed? Come in. I just talked to Frank. He wants to tear up that old contract. Let me finish this first. Oh, I forgot this is Tuesday. Hurry up with that, will you? I got some news. What does she want now? Just an elephant tusk. - Elephant tusk? Last month a leopard skin. Month before that, an African voodoo mask. Now an elephant tusk. You're lucky it isn't the whole elephant. All those funny presents. What kind of a girl is she, Dusty? She's just a kid. All kids collect stuff. Dolls, pictures, elephant tusks. I don't know anything abouther I can't even write to her. The kid's all right. She's in a fine school in Switzerland. Why, she's got everything. Everything but her mother. Now don't start feeling sorry for yourself. This is your night, slats. Why you're a big star. Then I can have Gloria here. Look... You're supposed to be a glamour girl. That's what they pay for, and that's what they're entitled to get. But whoever heard of a glamour girl with a 14-year-old daughter? They'll never believe you on the screen again. They'll say you're just a mother with a nice daughter. - But I can keep her hidden forever. So I'm not a star. - No, why wasn't I a bartender like old man wanted me to be instead of managing actresses? Now look, tomorrow I'm to close the deal for you. You'll get a small fortune and do you need it? There are other things more important than money. Yeah? Well, you name 'em. Now look, slats, about ten years ago, you came into my office, remember? You were just a gawky kid from the south, and you had a little baby by the hand. You said you were a widow and that she was your baby. You said all you wanted was a chance, a chance to work for your baby. Well, now, in order to cash in, you got to play safe, and then next year you'll have so much dough you won't have to worry about anything. Then you can go to Switzerland. You can climb up on the highest Alp they've got over there, and you can tell the whole world that you're not a glamour girl, that you're Mrs. Sarah Harkinson, and that you've got a daughter 14 years old. I love to whistle 'cause it makes me merry makes me feel so very I love to yodel everywhere I go yo de iey ee oh you da iey ee oh iey oh early to bed early to rise makes you healthy wealthy, and wise but I've found out I know it's true a whistle does so much more for you so I love to whistle troubles won't come near me 'specially when they hear me I love to yodel everywhere I go yo de iey ee yo de iey ee oh early to bed early to rise makes you healthy wealthy, and wise and I've found out I know it's true a whistle does much for you so I love to whistle troubles won't come near me 'specially when they hear me la da da da da da da la da da da da da la da da da da da I love to whistle 'cause it makes me merry makes me feel so very We sing a trio everywhere we go la la la la la la la la momma mmmmmmm la la la Early to bed early to rise makes you healthy wealthy and wise but I found out I know it's true a whistle does much more for you Felice, what are you doing? Stop it! I thought you were the leader. Look out! Oh, I'm awfully sorry you fell, felice. Yes, you are. Why do you dislike me? What makes you think I dislike you? Oh, don't you? No, I don't dislike you... I hate you. Hurry up, everybody. We'll be late. Almost time. Come on. Come on. Is everybody here? What happened to felice? I think she's taking a nap on the road. Yeah, I bet Gloria pushed her. I did not. She ran into a cart. Well, that's what she gets for trying to pass the leader. Listen, she's my friend and I don't... well, if she is, why don't you go back and pick her up? Oh, it's four o'clock, come on, girls, we'll be late. What did felice say to you when she fell? Nothing. I'm glad she fell. You know what she said today? It was about your father. What did she say about my father? She said she didn't believe he was an explorer, and she didn't believe he sent you all those trophies. Oh, well, who pays any attention to what she says. Nobody, but she said she was going to prove it. Look at her, limping in as if she broke her leg off! Oh, look what she's doing now. What? Something to our bicycles. Where are you going? Never mind. I'll be right back. Pranks that cause willful damage show very bad manners, Gloria. But I didn't do it. Who did it? Well, I didn't do it. You see, I just came down to see if the bicycle... adding falsehood makes it much more grievous, Gloria. But I didn't do it. - Now go to the classroom. Write on the blackboard 200 times, "young ladies must not stick nails "into other young ladies' bicycle tires." But I didn't do it. Start your punishment atonce. Yes, mademoiselle, but I didn't. Enter, please. Oh, so it's you. Is Gloria here? What are they locking the door for? Just answer my question. Gloria gets wonderful letters from her father, doesn't she? Yes, she does, why? - What does she do with them after she reads them to the girls? I don't know. I've got to get dressed. Excuse me. She tears them up, doesn't she? Yes, I guess she tears them up, so nosey people like you won't sneak in here looking for them like last week, that's why. Oh, is it? Who's handwriting is this? - It's Glor... I won't tell you. It doesn't belong to you. It doesn't belong to you, either. It belongs to Gloria, doesn't it? It's part of one of her father's letters. See, girls, she gave herself away. "Africa is so still and quiet and lonely." That was in her father's last letter, wasn't it? What of it? It's in her own handwriting, that's what. Well, maybe she writes like her father. A good many girls look like their fathers, and maybe some write like their fathers. And if... or you'rejust stupid. I bet Gloria's famous father never even killed a mouse. But the pictures prove it. You mean this junk? All you can see is his back. Why didn't he turn around so you could see his face? That shows how much you know about big game hunting. Why, if he turned around, he wouldn't have killed the rhinoceros. Rhinoceros would have killed him. That's Gloria's story. But wait until she gets the next letter and we can compare it with this, then we'll see what story she tells. Oh! Young ladies must not stick nails in other young ladies' bicycle tires young ladies must not stick nails in other young ladies' bicycle tires young ladies must not stick nails in other young ladies' bicycle tires young ladies must not stick nails in other young ladies'... I'll never get through... Felice has been telling lies about your father's letters all over school. What? She says you write them yourself well, how does she kno... How did she happen to say that? It's the most awful lie. I'm glad to see you are at the blackboard doing our little task. You may close the window, Olga. Pierre. Pierre. How was that, pretty good? - Very good. Tonight I lead the singing society. Oh, that's wonderful. Where is the papa now? In Africa. In the back of the book... We'll see where in Africa. The gold coast. That's a 10 franc stamp be careful of it. Give me the letter. I didn't write the letter. What? I didn't write the letter yet. But you write yourself a letter from your father every Saturday. Yes, I know, but... But this Saturday, you've got to write it. Please? Mnh-mnh. That's forgery. No, it isn't, not if I tell you what to write. Let me think it over a few days. And when I think it over, I don't think I'll do it. But I've got to get it when the elephant tusk comes. It's a matter of life and death. That's a good idea. Let's send a cable and say he got killed. Oh, no, we can't do that. I need him. All the other girls talk about their fathers. Well, how about your mother? Doesn't she do something? Oh, no, no, I can't talk about her. Well, all the others do. "My mommy went there, my mommy came here. "In Paris she bought me some shoes, "and then..." Whatever she does. But I guess it ain't as good as killing lions, eh? Please, Pierre. But I can't write so good, my hand shakes. Well, I'll tell them my father has a fever. But when you do it, it's you writing a dream, but when I do it, it's me writing a lie. Well, you can cross your fingers like this. That means you don't mean it. But I can't write when I do that. Well, take doubles on your left hand. See, like this. Oh, please, Pierre. Why do you always make me do something when I don't want to do it? "My dear darling, daughter, "we have just returned from a long trek to the interior. "It was an exciting trip, but not nearly as exciting "to me as a trip to see you would be. "That would really be something I'd like to do." There's your girl. You shouldn't talk like that, Henry. Some of the fellas will hear you. My, she's a very pretty little girl. Cut it out, will you? Have you spoken to her yet? No, and I don't intend to. I just like the way she sings. What's the matter? Nothing. Have you got a fever? Your face is red. No... I'm just warm. It must be the rain. How can cold rain make you warm? Well, it's the rain. Don't do that! That boy's waving at us. Well, don't look at him. Which one's waving, the one on the inside? Well, you told me not to look. How can I tell? Well, look a little bit, but don't let them see you. How do you do, monsieur Pierre? Hello, boys. How do you do? Uh, I say, how'd you like awilling chap to help you pump the organ today? Sure, you can. Oh, it's not me, it's my friend. But I don't know how to... He's so modest. One of the best organ pumpers in North America, this lad. But I can't... good, fine, go right upstairs. I'll be with you in a few minutes. In the meanwhile, you can get a little practice. Young lady, have you a brother over there? Oh, no, I just wanted to see if it was still raining. Yes, it's raining cats and dogs and boys, but that's no interest to you. Run along and take your place. God bless you. Bless you. Thank you. It's the dust in there. Yes, it is Dusty. Very Dusty. I guess that's because there's so much, um... So much... dust. Yes. Yes. Um, I'm to pump the organ today. Oh, pump the organ? Yes, with the pumper there. Oh, that's very nice. Yes, it is nice. Yes, well, I've got to go now. Yes, of course, you've got to go now. Yes, I've got to go now. Vveh, goodbye. Goodbye. No, there's something else first. What? It's about me and you, too. Would you have chocolate at the confectioner's, with me sometime, say Monday, when I have a three-hour off time for winning an essay contest about Napoleon? Oh, Monday... that's tomorrow. And your school goes to the exposition. If you could, I'd like you to have some chocolate and some of those little cakes and my name's Tommy green. I'm from the United States, the southern part, California near Mexico. Oh, from California near Hollywood? Yes, San Diego. I'm sorry. Oh. Sorry? I'm not sorry about being from San Diego. It's very nice there, and sometimes my brother takes me to Hollywood, to the studios. I'm sorry because I shouldn't have asked you to meet me at the confectioner's, maybe. Shouldn't you have? Yes, I shouldn't have. Oh, but I'd love to hear about California. Especially Hollywood and the people in the movies. I know all about them. I get fan magazines from america. You're American, aren't you? Yes. I knew it, Henry said so, too. He's my roommate. He's English. Olga's mine. She's Swedish. Oh, somebody's coming. Vveh, goodbye. Goodbye, andn I'd love to hear about California near Hollywood. Monday? Honest? Three o'clock. All right. Here we are. You bet we are. Your face is all red, and you're all perspiration, and you didn't even practice yet. No. Don't worry. I'm ready. All right, go. Ave Maria gratia plene Dominus tecum benedicta in mulieribus et benedictus fructus ventris tuijesus sancta Maria sancta Maria sancta Maria Maria Maria or a pro nobis nobis pecatoribus nuno et in hora in hora mortis hostrae a-a-a-a-men a-a-a-a-men a-a-a-a-men "With 60 bearers besides our hunters and scouts, "we made up quite a party. "When the charge was over, "three elephants were in our pens, "and the one that charged me was dead." I'm sending you his tusk. "We start north tonight "on another long trek through the jungle "to trap the man-eating lions near a village of a friendly chieftain." It's not in the same handwriting. "I will write to you just as soon as I get back near civilization. "Good night, my dear daughter." And remember that I'm always thinking about you and hope to see you soon. Your loving father." Oh, I wish I got letters like that instead of ones telling me about what my cousins did, and what my uncles did, and what my sisters did, and junk like that. Now aren't you sorry you said what you did? I saw you looking over her shoulder. Is this your father's picture? Why, yes, that's my father's picture. "An original photograph of the elephant "used for the trademark of jumbo cheese company. "Jumbo was one of the largest elephants in captivity." It's very interesting, especially the back. Give me that pic... oh, not till everybody sees it. Look, girls. It's an ad for a cheese company. Oh, my father captured that elephant for that company. He always sells the ones he brings back alive to circuses, and zoos, and cheese companies, or anybody that wants an elephant. Sure, yeah. So your father hunts for a cheese company? What's his name? Ronald or roquefort? Oh, and I bet your name is miss limburger, Gloria limburger. It sounds good, but p.U. Will you get out of here? Oh, I'm just going through your family album, miss limburger. Some of your relatives seem very strong. But don't you worry. Your father's still the biggest cheese of 'em all, and this proves it. "Eat... "Photographs." Olga? Come in here a minute. I shouldn't be in here. You're being punished. I know, I know. Uh, where are you going? I'm going to the exposition. Oh, you don't want to go to the exposition, do you? No, but everybody's going. Um, would you do me a great big favor? Yeah. What is it? Well, um, it's really a big favor now. Would you stay here and write the rest of these for me? Oh, no, I couldn't do that. Oh, please. It's a matter of life and death, really it is. But, no, I... I... please, Olga. You see I'm supposed to meet him at 3:00. Well, it's almost 3:00 now, and if I don't see him, I won't get another chance to hear anything about my mother. Well, I just can't be late because he might not be there. He? Who's he? Oh... well, uh, it's, um... It's my father. Your father? In effelberg? Shh, notsoloud. It's a big secret. It was in the letter in a postscript that I didn't read. He's coming here? Yes, for just an hour. I was supposed to meet him at the station. Will you stay for me? Oh, but why don't you... well! Ah, what have we here Olga Nelson? Don't you know that young ladies must not talk to other young ladies who are being punished? But it's all my fault. I asked her to come in through the window... never mind that. Olga, come with me in the next room and write, "young ladies must not visit "with other young ladies who are being punished." But the only reason I did it was because I wanted Gloria to meet her father. Her father. Gloria's father? My dear child! Oh, it doesn't matter, really. Why didn't you tell us. Olga, you're excused, go along, go along. Come with me, Gloria. Pierre, Louise! Miss... oh, definitely, Pierre! So your papa is coming? Is he bringing an elephant with him? Nobody's coming, you know that. Sure, I know it, but do you know it? I told you that dream father will make you a nightmare. Just drive by the station and then to the confectionery store and I'll wait in there and nobody will know the difference. All right, but in the next letter, instead of your papa shooting the lion, the lion will have to shoot papa. Giddy up! Whoa! I'll just walk through the station and get rid of these flowers. Wait for me. You get rid of the flowers and then we go back home and write a letter and get rid of papa. Here are some flowers for you. Hello. What are you doing here? I had to tell them. Especially her. I wanted to see what a famous explorer looked like. Well, it was very nice of you to come. We want to give him a good welcome. Continental express! Oh, here's the train. Oh, iwonder what he looks like. Stand back, everybody. Continental express. What's the matter? Did your father miss his train? Now my good man, don't scratch all that luggage about. There ought to be seven pieces. One, two, three, four, five, six... Where's the seventh? It's in your hand. I know, I know! Don't tell me! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. There we are, sir. Oh, welcome to Switzerland. Really? Tripps, what does one say on an occasion like this? Oh, just thank you, little girl, thank you, that's all. Just thank you and goodbye. Thank you. Well, uh, this is an old Swiss custom. You see, we always welcome the most distinguished-looking visitor on every train. Howjolly. And I have a carriage waiting for you to show you some of the village and take you wherever you're going. Carriage, how nice. With horses, I suppose? Oh, yes, one horse and a driver, but they'll get you there. Put these with the other things in the carriage will you? All right, young lady. Come on, bring the luggage, will you? Here we are, Pierre. All right, get in. What? We're going to the grand hotel. All of us? If you and the horse don't mind, yes. Oh, we don't mind. Put the luggage in there, will you? I'm afraid we're putting you to a lot of trouble, my child. Oh, no! No, not at all. You don't know what a great pleasure it is to welcome you. Oh, you better get in, and hurry. Hmm. Get up, moonbeam. Well, we're off. Decidedly off, miss. Giddy up. Hello, Mr. Harkinson! Hello, Mr. Harkinson! Uh, would you wave to them? They want to welcome you, too. Hello, Mr. Harkinson! Nyeh. Are you Swiss? No, I'm an American. That's odd, you, an American, carrying out a native Swiss custom to welcome me, an englishman. Oh, you're English? That's nice. Yes, we like it, but I've been in america a good deal, and my home is in Paris. Well, mine's in New York, but I've been over here going to school for the last five years. Mm. It's a small world. What's your name? Gloria Harkinson. Mine's Richard Todd. Well, I'm pleased to meet you. Thank you. Vveh, uh, goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, I mean, I better go across the threshold with you. That's part of the custom, too. Five... six... Now there's supposed to be seven pieces of luggage. Where's the seventh? In your hand, sir. Yes, I know, don't tell me! Hurry up and get the things to the hotel. Come on, now, hurry up! How long are you going to be here? Five days. Oh, that's awful. Awful? I mean, it's awful nice. Not so bad, really. I thought maybe you might be just passing through here on your way to interlaken. Interlaken's very nice, and only 20 miles more. Do you always welcome visitors to effelberg by telling them how nice it is in interlaken? Oh, no, not at all! I like interlaken. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. You'd like it, too. I think I'll stay here. Oh, well, uh... well, there's not much to see around here. I'm not planning on doing any sightseeing. No, I came here to rest. I bet you're a tired explorer. No, I'm a very tired composer. Oh. Oh, that's too bad. Vveh_.goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, well, I'll show you where the elevator is. Well, here are your flowers. Thank you. Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye! I wonder if you could tell me... He doesn't want to be disturbed till after eight o'clock. Very well, miss. And you know, of course, about the mail coming in for Mr. Harkinson and the calls. They're to go to Mr. Todd. Oh, I see. He's traveling incognito. Yes, incognito. Oh, and he told me to say that he won't see any newspaper reporters. I understand. He hates publicity. Thank you. You're welcome. You're next, felice. Can I help you, miss? Now make it fast, I haven't got all day. I'll only be a minute. I'm sorry I'm late. I can't stay. That's all right. I didn't think you were coming at all. Oh, but I said I was coming. Sorry, I have to leave now. I saw you in the carriage with another man. Oh, that wasn't anybody. That's my daddy. Oh, your father, is he here? I'd love to meet him. Yes, yes, of course, sometime, but I have to leave now. Well, I've got something inside for you. All right, well, don't go away, Pierre. Oh, no, I couldn't, really. Oh, please take it. Oh, no, I couldn't really. It's chocolates, and I know how hard it is to get them at school, and I can't eat them or I'll get a toothache again, and won't you please take 'em? Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Now giddy up! I'll tell you how they were Sunday. They're fruits and cream! What? Fruits and creams! Goodbye! Goodbye. Pardon me. Give me a double chocolate ice cream soda. Double? Whee! I think your father was wonderful, and just imagine... Oh, I bet you were thrilled. Is he gonna do any hunting here? Very nice, the candy's nice, best I've ever tasted. I thought he'd have a beard. Can I look underneath? What the beard? No, the candy, silly. Uh, felice, won't you have some of the candy my father gave me? I'm busy. Oh, come on. Have some. I don't eat candy. She's eating crow today instead. I need to study. Young ladies, what is this hubble bubble? Oh, Gloria, you're back. Yes, miss Annette. Come with me to the office for a moment. Come along. We tried to communicate with your parent and tell him how well you were doing here. Oh... you did? You called him? But they didn't know him at the grand hotel. Is it supposed to be a secret that he's here? Yes, it is. You see, he's incog... incognho. He's using his nom de plume... Mr. Todd, Richard Todd. Oh, that makes everything clear. Well, yes it does. But I don't think you better call him. I don't think he'd be interested. Not interested in his daughter? Well, I think he's only interested in resting. Family business upsets him. Oh, I see. You need say no more, you poor child. We shall be the very soul of discretion. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Water, monsieur? Did you phone up a moment ago to say there were two mademoiselles waiting to see Mr. Todd? Yes, sir. Well, that's impossible. Mr. Todd doesn't know any mademoiselles in this town. You waiting to see Mr. Todd? Oh, yes, we're very, very happy to meet you, Mr. Harkinson. My name is tripps. Oh, we misunderstood. We thought she said Todd. Mr. Todd's Todd. I'm tripps. I understand. We come on a very delicate mission. Delicate mission? You may state it, mademoiselle. Thank you, sir. Would you ask him to take luncheon with us at the institute? Luncheon? Is this the delicate mission? What kind of an institute is it? An institute for young ladies. Oh, for young ladies. Oh, Mr. Todd might like that. I know his daughter would like it very much. Yes, of course. His daughter? She's a pupil at the institute. His daughter a pupil at your institute? You mean to say Mr. Todd has a daughter going to school at your institute? We've told you when it was supposed to be a secret. I am his confidential secretary. And you must never betray our confidence in this matter. You may trust me, mademoiselles, even if he doesn't. Then we shall expect him at half past the noon hour. Half past the noon hour. Thank you, mademoiselles. Very sorry, I shall have to resign. Don't argue with me. Things have come to a pretty pass, a pretty, pretty pass. Oh, tripps, you're not really going to leave my service, are you? Yes, I am, sir! Yes, I am! I'm supposed to be your confidential secretary as well as your manservant, but am I? You have secret daughters stuck away in secret institutions. Well, tripps, there are certain things... Never mind, "well, tripps"! Stand still when I'm talking to you. I'm an honorable man. I've always worked for honorable people. And if they haven't been honorable, at least they've let me know about it. Why I've given you the best years of my life and you still refuse to confide in me, telling me you came to this little Swiss village to rest. Poppycock! I know the real reason you came here, Mr. Todd. You came here to see this child you keep hidden from the world. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about! Oh, you wish something, sir? What's wrong with you, tripps? Nothing wrong with me, sir. I was just going over a few things in my mind. I heard you from the next room. Why this packing? Packing, sir? Oh, I'm just checking these things. I don't trust the laundry, sir. Well, never mind that. What's all this about a child? Oh, nothing, sir, except that she expects you at the institute to take luncheon with her and the other young ladies at half past the noon hour. What are you talking about, tripps? Your daughter... daughn Mr. Harkinson. And now young ladies, I'm going to dismiss class a few minutes early today. 'Cause I want you to be ready for luncheon promptly when the bell rings. We have a guest, an honored and distinguished guest. Oh. A man you've heard a great deal about. Gloria Harkinson's father. Please run along, run along. We mustn't keep a great man waiting. Hurry, hurry, hurry! And now, dear, come with me! Come with me. You see? Everything looks very nice. Your father will be very pleased. Yes. You seem so nervous, my child. Yes, I mean, no, I'm just excited. You see my daddy's shy, and maybe won't come. Why don't you go to the hotel and get him? Yes, iwill, I'll try... Don't worry, dear. He'll be here any minute now. Any minute? Oh, well... I should have known about this earlier. We couldn't interfere with your class work, my child. Well, uh, I'll go and try and head him off, I mean, meet him. There's a man coming down ourroad. I'm sure it's your father. Well, I'll be right back. Oh, tell the girls to be ready. Yes, mademoiselle. Oh, she's so sweet, our Gloria. I'm so excited. What's wrong, Pierre? Oh, nothing. I'm a little bit excited myself, uh, I guess. Uh, I thought you'd be here. Oh, I'm sorry about what happened, but I can explain everything. Oh, wait. I'm sorry about what happened, too, but I'll do all the explaining and itwon't wait. But I didn't mean to, really. All the girls were at the station, and I told them my father was coming. I'm not interested. But you've got to be interested. I had to make you up. You had to what? I had to make you up. You see, I haven't any father, and I can't talk about my mother, so I made up a father, and you happened to come along, so you were it. I was it? Well, young lady, I don't like to be it. Oh, but you don't have to. You can go away. Please go away. Not till I've straightened this out. But you mustn't go in there. It's a matter of life and death. I'm sorry. But... I'll have to leave school if you do. I'm sorry about that, too. But they'll know all the stories I told about my father weren't true. You should have thought about that before you told them. Oh, please. You've got to help me. I'm afraid I can't. Well, uh, I'm an American, and you're an englishman. And england's the mother country. That doesn't mean that I have to be your father. Oh, I know, I know, but if you don't go in there, you don't have to be anybody, please. We welcome you to our little institute, Mr. Harkinson. I wish you wouldn't call me Mr. Harkinson. I'm sorry, I forgot. You're incognito. Young ladies, I want to present you to Gloria's father. Before you go any further, I think there's something you should know. When you do me all this honor, you rather embarrass me. Until I realize that you're really paying honor to my daughter. I hope the food is satisfactory. I didn't know exactly what explorers are accustomed to eating. Hmm? Oh, penguin and seal steaks, polar bear chops. In Africa, you had seal steaks and polar bear? Oh, no, no. That's when he's in the north pole. Isn't it, daddy? Uh, yes, yes, the north pole. There are no polar bears in Africa, young lady. Everybody knows that. You have lion meat in Africa, don't you, daddy? Well, sometimes, but, um... Lions are generally pretty tough, you know. Now giraffes, they're quite delicious, especially the neck. Oh, they're quite the thing for big dinner parties. Twenty people can sit down with just one giraffe's neck. Would you tell us about the time you shot the rhinoceros, the one in the picture Gloria has? The, uh, rhinoceros. Well, it was either me or the rhinoceros. And after all, here I am while he sleeps in a lonely rhinoceros's grave. In a museum. Of course, in a museum. What about the elephant you captured for the cheese company? Do you mean the, urn... Elephant for the cheese company? You mean... oh, I... Let me get that. What elephant and what cheese company? They put it on the package. What, uh, oh... Thank you. You, um, do you want to know about the elephant for the cheese factory? Quite a package. Oh, that means it was a big elephant. That's the way hunters talk. For big elephants they say "package." I think it's kind of cute. It also means very wild, untamable. He seemed pretty tame when you were sitting on his neck. While I was sitting on his neck. Well, That's easy to explain. You see, I have a peculiar effect on elephants. I just look them in the eye. In only one eye? Well, it is rather a job to look at an elephant in two eyes. You see, there's one over there, the trunk comes in between, and there's another eye over there. Oh. But how did you capture him? Singlehanded, didn't you, daddy? You tracked him for days. For days and days, uphill and down Dale. Then one morning, I met him face-to-face. He was having his breakfast. He seemed rather cross. I stepped to one Side fixed my stare on one eye, and in a very determined fashion I said, "elephant, I am your master," and he came running toward me. "Stop!" I cried. His steps grew slower and slower, but he kept on coming until there we stood, face-to-face. He grabbed me round the waist with his trunk! Ah! Yes, and raised me up high. I closed my eyes waiting for the moment when he would throw me into the bottomless chasm miles below. Then... I found his trunk slipping slowly from my waist. And I fell... oh! Yes! I fell on the back of his neck where he wanted me. He looked up at me and smiled. Then he lifted his trunk waved it gaily, blasted a joyful call and galloped off with me through the jungles. And brought me to the throne of the white Princess. The white Princess? You never told me about her before. I didn't? Oh, well, I'll tell you now. A boutonniere for a great man, monsieur. Not really great. I say great, monsieur, and I know. Well, the white Princess ruled way back in the jungle. She lived in a castle... I wish they'd get through talking to him. So do I. Monsieur, your daughter is such a sensitive child. Is she? Her grandfather's people were very sensitive, too, on her mother's Side. She will never speak of her mother. And her mother never comes here, only letters and checks. And every young girl needs a mother, monsieur, to see sometimes. You're quite right. Then you will permit her mother to come and visit her? Perhaps, the terms of the divorce are such that... The divorce, yes. On a thing like this, a man in my position needs a little help! Help? Just plain, simple help. Oh, daddy, you said you wanted to hear me sing. Why, yes, of course dear, splendid. I can't disappoint her. I haven't heard her sing since she was a baby. Will you excuse me? I1!mayfiforyou, dear hmm? What's the matter, can't you sing? I can sing if you can play. Do you know chapel bells? I can sing it if you can play it. I wonder what he's gonna play. Oh, probably some little thing he learned from the king of the Congo. Chapel bells I love the melody they bring chapel bells tell of youth and spring through the years they have chimed their story of romance through the years love has found its chance gone is every note ofsadness when the music fills the air when they ring their song of gladness happy hearts are everywhere chapel bells I hope someday that there may be chapel bells ringing out for me Chapel bells Chapel bells full ofyouth and spring gone is every note ofsadness when the music fills the air when they ring their song of gladness happy hearts are everywhere chapel bells hear them ringing loud and strong chapel bells making life a song So I did all this? Every bit of it. I feel quite proud of myself. But you know you told some pretty tall stories. Oh, but I kept my fingers crossed. And when I do that, it means I don't mean it. Did I send you that elephant tooth? Tusk. I mean tusk. Where did I get it? Africa. Lovely place, Africa. And this? The isle of Haiti. And that spear? French indochina. Hmm. I get around a good deal, don't I? Wherever Pierre has a stamp from. Nothing. And this I suppose is me? Oh, certainly. Hmm, quite a chap. Hunter, explorer, family man. Sit down just a second. This is a bit awkward. Yesterday when I came to Switzerland, I was a bachelor. I had no wife. I had no children. Today, of course, I have a daughter and somewhere in the world, a wife. Oh, please don't ask me about my mother. Only what she looks like and where she lives. Those questions come up, it seems. Well, I'll show you a picture of her. I've never let anybody else see these before, but I suppose it's all right to show them to you. Certainly, I'm sort of a relative now. That's my father. He was a Navy flyer. He died when I was a baby. Oh, I'm sorry. Is that your mother? Oh, n-no. No, that's me. You certainly were a cute baby. Is this girl really your mother? Yes, but that's years and years ago. You've grown since then. I suppose I have. You do look like your mother. Oh, thank you. What's her name? Harkinson. Oh, same as mine. Well, I think I ought to be getting back to the hotel. Goodbye. It's been lots of fun being your father. Goodbye, daddy. Whoa, I've got a father and it makes me merry makes me feel so very Didn't you understand when I told you that Mr. Todd was not to be disturbed unfilnoon? But the young man said it was urgent. Where is the young man? Well, young man. How do you do, Mr. Harkinson? I'm not Mr. Harkinson! Mr. Todd's Mr. Harkinson! I'm Mr... Oh, it doesn't matter. I'm his secretary. What is this urgent business? I... I guess it's kind of a family matter. Family matter? Oh, yes, come this way, please. What do you want? It's very important, sir. What's important? Your son, sir. What?! Just another one of your secrets, sir. What's he talking about? He's got it all wrong. I'm not your son, sir. I'm Tommy gray. How do you do? How do you do? And I came to see you about your daughter. Daughter? Oh! Gloria. Now I'm beginning to see daylight. Comeandsfldown thank you, 9n I, uh, I... well, that is, we, Gloria and I, I talked to her yesterday at the dentist's again. We were having our teeth cleaned, and we met there. I was... I was... yes, go on. You don't smoke I suppose, do you? Oh, no, I don't smoke. Can I get you something to drink? Maybe a glass of milk? No, no, thanks, I don't like milk. But I'm very fond of your daughter Gloria and we're very good friends, and that's what I came to talk to you about. Yousee, wshkethb. Vvhoa, notsofast now, you and Gloria are good friends. Yes, that is, I'm a good friend of hers. And I'm going away, but I'll be back. And that's what I came to talk to you about, when I come back. Tell me, do you mind if I have a drink? No, §n thank you. Hmm... You know this is a very trying time for a father. Now I think I get the idea. Well, personally, young man, I think Gloria's a little young to be talking about marriage. No, I don't want to marry her. Oh, you don't? Sit down, young man. This sounds very serious. Now just what do you want? Well, when I get back, you'll be gone away. Mm-hmm. And you might get killed. What? Well, a rhinoceros might Gore you, or a lion might jump on your back, or even a tiger. Well, that's nice of you to think of that for me. Oh, you're welcome, and I just wanted to tell you that if you do get killed, I'll be here. And I want you to tell Gloria that she can turn to me. That's a very comforting thought. I'll remember it, too, when I'm lying out there in thejungle with a rhinoceros leaning on my back. Thank you. Oh, you're welcome. And any little thing I can do like that to make life more pleasant for you, I'll be only too glad. That's all. Well, I have to leave now. I won't get a chance to tell her. That's the reason I thought if I told you, you could tell her. Tommy, you may trust me completely. I'll tell her if I get killed that you're... Well, that you're to be a father to her. Oh, thanks, thanks very much. Thank you. You're welcome. Goodbye. That will be all, tripps. I hope so... sir. Very nice, thank you. Merci, monsieur. Hello, Mr. Harkinson. Mr. Harkinson. Why, hello there. I'm glad to see you. I'm glad to, too. Did you tell her? You know, aboutwhen you go away and I come back after I go away? Oh, no, no, not yet. But I'll tell you what we'll do. Come out and join the party and we'll tell her together. Sure. What, in there? Oh no, I think it'll be better if you told her when I wasn't there. Uh, possibly. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Isn't the one of the girls from the school? She's the one who didn't believe I had a father. Hello, there. How do you do? Do come and join the party. We're waiting for you. No, I have to get some stamps. Oh, the stamps can wait. Come on, please. Well, I can only stay a minute. I love to whistle 'cause it makes me merry makes me feel so very I love to yodel everywhere I go Early to bed early to rise makes you healthy wealthy, and wise but I found out I know it's true a whistle does much more for you so I love to whistle troubles won't come near me 'specially when they hear me Da-da-da-da-da-da-da Pardon me, will you? Is that for me? I hope so. I mean, yes, sir. I think it's you. Gloria. Ihavetoleave for Paris tonight. Oh, I'm sorry. I have to, it's business. I think, perhaps, you better tell the others, huh? Mm-hmm. Hey, girls, girls. Uh, my daddy just received a cable. He's leaving. He has to go to le harve and get a boat. And then from le harve he's going to... To the north pole for polar bears. Polar bears? Polar bears? Who's she talking about? Who do you suppose she's talking about? She's talking about me. Tired of packing? No, it's fun. Fun? Oh, I didn't mean it was fun packing for your going away. I meant that I never packed for my father before, anditsfun. I see. I suppose it is. Now what comes next? Goodbye? No, goodbye comes later. Socks come next. They're over there. I'll put them in. Then run back to the school and get permission to come to the train. Oh, may I? Most certainly, it would look funny if you weren't there to kiss your daddy goodbye now, wouldn't it? It certainly would. I'll see how tripps is getting along with the trunk. Hello. Heho. Heho, oh, heho, hello. Goodbye, I'm in a hurry. I'm in a hurry, too, but I just wanted to ask you, did your father say anything about anything? Oh, yes, he's going away. That's why I'm in a hurry. Oh well, if you're in a hurry, I guess you'd better hurry. Oh, goodbye. Bye. Hello. Hello. Oh wait a minute. I just wanted to ask you if your father was really leaving. Oh, yes he is and I can't waste anytime standing around here talking to you. Oh, well, I wanted to tell you that I think he's the nicest father in the world, and I'm sorry for all the things I've said and... I'm sorry he's going away and leaving you again and... I'm just sorry. Well, don't cry, felice. Maybe this going away is gonna be all for the best anyway. The train leaves in one minute and 20 seconds, sir. Well, why aren't you on it? Are you going to stay behind, sir? Of course not. So your daughter didn't come down to say goodbye. She said goodbye at the hotel. Isee, su, ahowwne. Thank you. If I were your daughter, sir, and you were going away with polar bears, sir, I think that I should certainly... Yes, tripps, but you are not my daughter. Just an example, sir, a mere simile, sir. I'm not going away with any polar bears. Well, I'm glad to hear that, sir. And I'm nobody's father. I've never been married. Does that make everything perfectly clear? Oh, perfectly, sir. We're leaving Switzerland just as we came, with neither kith nor kin. Goodnight, sir. Now forget about all this nonsense about my having a daughter. Gladly, sir. Good night. Good night. No, no, get back here! Pardon me, please. Come back! Come back! Come back! Quick, catch her! Where's your ticket? Hello. Your ticket, please. Well, I haven't got one. You see, my father... I don't see your father. Well, neither do I. That's just the trouble. I'm looking for him. Stop this nonsense. Buy a ticket or get off at the next station. Oh, but I can't. I haven't any money. That's your fault, your father's fault, or the whole world's fault, not my fault! Put her in the Porter's room until we get to the next station. Come along don't you touch me! Come along. You can't stay here. I'll tell my father about this! Let me go! Tell your father. Tell your grandfather! Ihavetolook for my father! (Lmet let me go! You stay in there. You let me out of here! I have to look for him! I have to go to Paris! You want to disturb everybody? Disturb everybody? Yes! You let me out of here! Let me out of here!

Let me through. This is an outrage. This is contrary to all regulations. Hello. You can dispense with the formalities. You'll go to the baggage car. You have no ticket, and you break all the laws. Well, I just wanted my daddy to know I was on the train. You can't fool us. We know your father isn't on the train. Who says he isn't? I'm her father. Yes, sir, but... Come on, dear. Tripps, you tell him. So, he's her father? Yes, definitely, sir. I never doubted it for a moment, sir. He is her father. Yes! All right! Yes, go on. And I found out my mother was in Paris and I just had to see her. Well, couldn't she have come to Switzerland? Oh, no, no, no. She can't come to Switzerland. She's a... well, she just can't. That's why I had to get on the train, to see her. It's a matter of life and death. Yes, it's always life and death, isn't it? Oh, but this time it really is. And, you won't be coming to see me anymore. Oh, I... No, no, it's too dangerous. I think you'll just disappear at the north pole. Get lost. I'm sorry to do it, but it seems the best way. Of course, I'll miss you a lot. Don't worry. A friend of yours has asked me to tell you that when the inevitable happens and I am no more, he would like the job as your guide, philosopher and protector. Tommy? Yes. Well, good night. Good night. Hotel Lafayette, mademoiselle. Well, thank you very much for the lovely ride on the train. Now don't forget, you have my address. Bring your mother when you come over. Yes, iwill. I mean, maybe I will. I'd like to meet her. Well, bye. Goodbye, Mr. Tripps. Goodbye. Savoy hotel, please. Yes, ma'am. Good afternoon, savoy hotel. I want to talk to Gwen Taylor. The line's busy. I'll put you through to her manager in just a moment. Well, just say it's Gloria calling. Well, that's fine, my good fellow, yes. Could you all hold on a minute, please? Yes. Hello? She's not in. I say she's not in. Who, Gloria? Putheron! I have Mr. Turner for you now. Go ahead, please. Hello, this is Dusty. Oh, I remember you from your letters. How's everything in Switzerland? I'm not in Switzerland. I'm right downstairs. In a phone booth. Downstairs in a phone booth? Which one? Number four. Numberfour? You close that door and stay right where you are. Don't you move a foot. I haven't got time for you now, son. Don't bother me now, please. I'm Dusty Turner. How do you do? Oh, I'm fine, thanks. How are you? Very well, thank you. That's nice. Now sit down and tell me how you got here. Well, I came on the train. Well, how did you get away from the school? Well, I just... Well, it wasn't hard. Oh, that's bad business. You shouldn't have left the... Oh, I know. Well, I was lonely and one day I... And I found out my mother was... shh. Gwen. Gwen was here. Thatsbefier andlcame. I only want to see her for a minute. Just to say hello and talk, and then I'll go right back. But that's not going to be as easy as you think. You're not going to let me see her? I'm not gonna stop you. They are. Who? Those people out there, her fans. Oh, well, I can wait. I don't mind. But that's not it. You see, she sort of belongs to them. But I belong to her. She's my mo... Well, you know. I know it's tough on you, and it's tough on Gwen, and me, too. Now I don't want to be cruel. Nobody would find out. Couldn't I see her for just a minute? If she even had you in her arms for a minute, she'd never let you go away again. That wouldn't be good, would it? No, that'd be very bad. You see, everything a big star does, everything about her makes people talk. They guess and gossip and watch every move she makes, everything she does. Then they tell the newspapers, and the newspapers print it. She's got to be different. Why, she's almost like a Princess in a fairytale. I see. And a Princess in a fairytale can't have a daughter as big as I am. Can she? Aw, but next year she's going to be with you, all the time. Goodbye. Isn't there anything else you want, Gloria? Anything I can do for you? No, thank you. Monsieur! Monsieur, uh, Turner! Mademoiselle Taylor has returned. Yeah, well, where is she? In the foyer, surrounded by the people of Paris. Is it not wonderful? Wonderful? Why, that's terrific. Now listen, honey... Where did that little girl go? Hmm? Why, I'm sure I don't know. Well, look around and see if you can find her. And when you do, bring her right back to me right away. Yes, yes. I certainly will, monsieur tal... Taylor, oh! This are for you, miss Taylor. Oh, you darling. Now, please, folks, please. Now don't crowd. Just leave them at the desk and miss Taylor will autograph them later for you. I suppose you think I've got nothing else to do but to stand here and wait for the bell to ring. I suppose you think the dishes wash themselves and my master's things brush themselves and press themselves and that... Oh, good evening. Hello. We weren't expecting you till tomorrow. Is your mother with you? No, I came alone. Well, your fath... mister... He... he's inside. Come in, dear. Come on. Uh? Why, hello there. She's alone, sir. Come in, Gloria. I'm sorry to bother you so much. Bother me? Why, it's a very pleasant surprise. Did you find your mother all right? Yes, I saw her. Take off your coat and hat. You're going to stay for a while, aren't you? Did you have a nice time? Yes, I had a very nice time, thank you. I bet your mother was surprised to see you. Why, yes. That is, she was at first. Is that the song you were playing just now? Yes. How long is your mother going to... Could I sing it? You mean, right now? Yes, I'd like to try. All right, then. Hope you can read the lyrics. A serenade to the stars in the still of the night I'll sing my refrain will I find the one that shines above that will light up my way to io-o-ve a song is there at the start and the words that I sing come right from my heart What's the matter? Come now, don't cry. The song isn't that bad. Tell me, Gloria, what's wrong? Nothing. Remember, I'm your father. You picked me out yourself, you know. Could you send me back to school. Tomorrow? Send you back tomorrow? Does your mother know about all this? She gave me the money to go. But I lost it. Did you tell her you lost it? I didn't think ioughtto. She's very poor. Poor? And stopping at the Lafayette? Well, she's poor in a very rich way. Oh. The new poor. Thank you. But you had a good time with your mother? Oh, yes, we had a very good time. Tell me all about it. Well, I... I met her at the sa... At the Lafayette. And she was so glad to see me that she hugged me till she almost took the breath out of me. Justbecause she was glad to see me. And then she just stood back and looked at me. And then she started to cry. And I cried... Just because we were both so happy. It's funny how you cry when you're happy, isn't it? And then... Then she laughed. Shelaughed, andllaughed. And everybody looked. She's so beautiful. And then we just talked... Because I had so much to tell her. She had so much to tell me. And she told everybody else to... to go away, and we just stayed there alone together. And then... Now tell me what really happened. Just what I told you. And then she had to go to a party. And I said I'd better get back to school, because the fusenot sisters wouldn't like it. They didn't know I was leaving, you see. And she said I was right. And then she gave me the money. And... and I lost it. And then I came to ask you if... I'm glad you did. Do you want to go back tonight? Well, I'd like to stay in Paris till tomorrow. You see, I don't get here very often and... Of course, I forgot. This is a sort of a holiday. All right, we'll make it one. Well, thank you! Top hat, white tie, tails for me, flowers for you and one of the finest concerts you've ever heard. Oh, no, no concerts. Hmm? Ithoughtyou hkedrnuflc. Oh, I do, I certainly do. I'm mad about music. But, well, we have concerts atschool and you said this was a holiday, and I'd like to do something else if you would. Your wish is my command. Tonight, mademoiselle, Paris is yours! Here, blow. Did you not assume this name to conceal certain occurrences in your past of which you are ashamed? No. Is it not true that the man you killed... I object, your honor, on the ground that the question assumes a fact not in evidence. The prosecution has no right to assume the defendant to be guilty of this or any other crime! Objection sustained. The attorney for the prosecution may reframe the question. Is it not true then, that the murdered man had certain information, which, had it been revealed, might have damaged your reputation? I object, your honor! The question is incompetent and irrelevant. Intends to force the defendant into an incriminating statement. Order in the court. Objection sustained. Very well, then. Is it not true that on the night of march 10th, you visited Harrison James and demanded from him certain incriminating letters? I did visit Harrison James, but it had nothing to do with any letters. You visited Harrison James at his apartment on the night of the murder and quarreled with him violently, did you not? We had a disagreement. Disagreement? I think I recognize that young lady up there. Can you tell the court the nature of that disagreement? I said I think I recognize that young lady up there. Well, I should hope so. She's a very famous actress. Everybody recognizes her. That's Gwen Taylor. She looks very much like that picture you showed me of your mother. Do you think so? I hadn't noticed. Are you thatanna haskell? - Yes. Did you know Harrison James at that time? Yes. And didn't he threaten to expose your past? - Well, didn't he? - Iobject, your honor! Gloria, are you sure that isn't your mother? Why, no, she couldn't be my mother. She's too young. If she were my mother, she'd be much older than that, and she couldn't be such a big movie actress. To make known the fact that you had served a term in prison! You can't answer that question, can you? You can't answer it because you know that if you answer truthfully, this jury will find you guilty of willful murder! I object, your honor! What's wrong? Nothing. I'll be right back. Order! I want to go back to Switzerland. Tonight. Right away. Tonight? Yes. You don't mind if we don't see the rest of the picture, do you? No, dear child, I don't mind. And I think it's time you went back where you belong. I'll get it, Anna. Hello? Yes, oh, yes, I put the call in hours ago. Yes, this is Mrs. Harkinson. Hello, miss fusenot. This is Gloria's mother. Yes. What? Oh, but there must be some mistake. In Paris? Yes. She's with Mr. Harkinson. Mr. Harkinson? Her father? He said he was traveling incognho as a Mr. Richard Todd. But I don't know any Richard Todd. I'll call you right back. Dusty! Oh, Dusty! Dusty! What's the matter? Gloria's in Paris! She's here. She's left Switzerland last night with a man who said he was her father! Call the police. - Now, now don't get excited. Sit down here and take it easy, will you? Are you crazy? Gloria's in Paris! I know she is. You know she is? Yeah, I saw her this afternoon. She's all right. Oh, where is she? Where is she, Dusty? Now look, she didn't want to talk to you. She just wanted to see you. She didn't want to talk to me? Now, don't take it that way. I told her what itwould mean if people knew that you had a daughter herage. You didn't really do that? Why, she wouldn't have been with you five minutes before somebody around this hotel tipped off the newspapers. You could have managed. You've managed everything else. What did you want me to do, present her to the press? Hello! Mr., uh, Turner. Well, everybody's here waiting for mademoiselle Taylor. We'll be right down. Yes, thank you... Come on, honey. They're all waiting. I'm not going down there. Aw, now look, slats, you can't do that. They'll know something's wrong if you don't show up. Aw, why don't you use your head? I know you want news, and I'm going to give it to you I have a 14-year-old daughter, and she's right here in Paris tonight. You can't do that to me! Oh, please, I'll wait for you outside. Oh, no, we have a little business to do here. I thought you were a friend of mine. I'm your father, and fathers sometimes have to be stern. How do you do? I want you to see miss Gwen Taylor. Oh, you can't see her! She's out! She's not here. The little girl is right. That is, she's not out, but she's engaged at the moment. I want to see her right away. She's being interviewed by the press and cannot be disturbed. My good man, you may not realize, but it's time she was disturbed, and she will be disturbed. Come on. Butwait a minute. It'll be awfully embarrassing. Please don't do it. It's a matter of life and death. Please. Please! I'm sorry, I consider this a fatherly duty. Oh, but you're all wrong! As I said before, miss Gwen Taylor cannot be disturbed, and that's final. Now wait a minute! Now, listen, please! We're gonna give you a formal statement in a few minutes. Can't you wait till then? Try to help me find her! Please try to help me find her! How can we find her if you don't know where she is? She's right here is Paris! But where in Paris? With a man who says he's her father. Her father? Her father? I didn't know you had a husband. Where is he? I don't know where he is, but you must find him! Here I am. Hold it! That's her daughter! She looks like her. No, this is all a mistake. I never saw her before. My father and I just came to look in. Vveh, goodbye! Gloria... My baby. Oh. Mummy. Mummy, I didn't tell them. Yes! Yes, he's her father! We're going to give you a statement! You've got this thing all wrong! Now if you don't mind stepping over here? Now, miss Taylor... Get back in there. Look out there and smile again, get it! One of you alone, Mr. Taylor? I'm not Mr. Taylor. Now, you and your daughter alone, Mr. Taylor. I hope you don't think me presumptuous. Certainly not. I'll find out! What is your business, Mr. Taylor? Me, I'm not Mr. Taylor. He doesn't do anything. He's a retired capitalist, sportsman, big game hunter. The whole thing's a misunderstanding fine! "Misunderstanding keeps romantic couple separated ten years." Oh, no, that's not what the misunderstanding was about. Just come over here by yourself. We want a big picture of you.
