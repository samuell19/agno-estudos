- Oh. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Shut up. You shut up. Come on. Give it to me. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh, fuck. Oh. - Oh, just, yes. - Yes. Yeah, deeper, yeah. Deeper, Donny. Deeper, Donny. Aww. Aww. Yeah. - Perhaps... - It doesn't work. Probably just as well. - It would be an awkward moment. - To interrupt. Come on, fuck me please. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God! Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Deeper. Yeah. Yeah, just like that. Oh, oh, Donny. Oh, deeper, Donny. Don't stop. No. I... I... I don't think it'll be longer. - Let me come. Let me come. - Me too, me too, me too, yeah. - Very simultaneous. - Yeah. Nicely timed. Oh, my God! How long do you think we should give them? Huh? Not a whole cigarette. A puff or two. Excuse me. Go. Go. You go. Go. Hi. I... I was just in the back, you know, taking, um, uh, the... the phone reservations. Checking in Sorensen. I have a reservation for two nights. - Ah. - And this gentleman. Um, I've misplaced my keycard. Manning, 104. You can take him first. - Oh, no. - Please. Thanks. You must be tired... traveling. - Well, you've been something. - Oh, fuck! Just an expletive. Forgot I was wearing it. See you tonight. Thank you so much. Sorensen. S-O-R... Arrived. Is it closed? It's getting late, I suppose. Um, the girl at the desk assured me that everything was still open. Okay. I'm starving. Long trip? London to Toronto, then a local flight here. Yeah, it's been a very long day. You're not here for the reunion, are you? No, you're not. Reunion? Yeah, high school reunion this weekend. Oh, really? That... that's why you're here? Yeah. One of the stupider decisions in a life of very stupid decisions. And now I could really use another drink. Cindy. - Where the hell's Cindy? - Cindy? Yeah, our waitress. - I... I don't know. - Shit. All right. Um, what... what can I get you? Oh, what soups do you have? You want the soup? Oh, no, no, uh, perhaps salad? Salad. Maybe you could suggest something. Uh, I think the lasagna is excellent. - Lasagna sounds perfect. - Great. - Uh, this gentleman. - Yeah. Oh, uh, yeah, I was just wondering if I could get a drink maybe. Do I look like the bartender too? Just maybe a glass of wine? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll get it for you when I get around to it. Jesus. Cindy, come on. Maybe it'd be easier for him if we, uh... You mind if I join you? Yeah, sure, yeah. Glad to have a company. - I'm Abby. - Ah. Luke. So the reunion didn't go well? God, could not have gone worse. I don't want to talk about it. Maybe we should, uh, what about, uh, maybe we could... England. I spent a... a few years there when I was younger. Had a string of awful jobs, God. I remember, uh, cleaning vomit off a bathroom floor in a pub in Hackney. Hackney, nice. Oh, Meg, is it okay if I go home a bit early? I don't give a fuck what you do, Cindy. Just... Okay, great. See you tomorrow. Could I get a drink? Oh, uh, actually I'd prefer... put it on the tab for Room 1... Uh... - Cindy. - Yeah. - I know you were. - No, I wasn't. I know you were, so don't fucking lie to me. I'm not lying. - Okay, well, something's going on. - Nothing. It's... - Look at yourself. - What? You're happy. No, I'm not. I am not happy. You were smiling earlier and so something is making you happy. Oh, you're telling me I'm not supposed to smile now? Do you think... do you think I'm a fool? You don't think I see what's going on? Everything I do here is for you. Everything is for you and for this fucking hotel. It is not. It is for us, babe, for our future together. Come on. That is why I keep working, I work my ass off every single day. And I don't? I do more to keep this place going than you do. - You would be fucking lost without me. - Fine. Fine. You think... you think I don't do anything here? You think you don't need me. Try... try doing this without me. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. Fuck. Fuck. What do we do now? - My room or... - I'm in 602. Oh, I'm just down here and I... I have a suite. Sure. - I am a gentleman. - And I have a black belt. You won't need it. And they had a band of high school students, current high school students, - playing Frank Sinatra songs. - No. I mean, I don't know if there's anything worse than hearing a bunch of 16-year-olds playing "I Did It My Way." God! Why did I come? Why do we ever go to these things? Curiosity. To see the one that got away. - Yes. - Yeah. Anyway, enough about what an idiot I am. What brings you to a small town in Northern Ontario? My brother. He died. I have to close down his house and the funeral is tomorrow. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. I hadn't seen him in years and, uh, my parents had a divide and conquer approach to raising their children and, uh, yeah, it worked. And he was, pick a euphemism, troubled. Right. Okay, if I raid your minibar, do you mind? Help yourself. So you grew up here? Yeah. My, uh, my dad worked at the steel company but, uh, he had a gambling problem. He found himself in a ton of debt, lost the house, and the day the bank foreclosed, he took off for parts unknown. I was 16. Mom walked out on both of us years before, so welfare paid for me to rent a tiny basement room until I finished high school, which the whole town knew. - The good old days, right? - But there was... - Kayla. - Kayla. Yeah. Who made it all worthwhile. She did, indeed, man. She was springtime, puppies, lollipops and a whole lot of sex appeal and I was, uh, Heathcliff. Heathcliff? Or so I imagined. But, um, she wanted... she wanted stability, you know. She started talking about marriage, a job at the steel company. So, late one night I just hitchhiked away. And regretted it ever since? Flashes of regret which grew bigger and brighter as the failed relationships piled up. Then I heard about the reunion and I was blinded by the light. - And so tonight. - Heathcliff returned. And look at him, he owns his own home. Well, a mortgage in, uh, New York City. - New York? - Okay, Brooklyn. - Still. - And this really nice suit. Yeah, it is nice. I even sprung for the best suite in this hotel. What a man, you know, bow down you small town folks, stand in awe, Ms. Lollipop. And? Ms. Lollipop's married of course. - No. - Two kids. I made a complete fool of myself. God! I mean, really embarrassing. You know, Jesus, I... I even looked her name up online and nothing came up. An idiot would have figured out she was married. She'd probably marry some really great guy. - He'll be laughing tonight when he hears what I said. - No. Take my advice. If you should ever plan a speech for years, do not under any circumstances actually say it out loud. Well, I have to be up early to get started on my brother's place so I should get going. Oh, please, come on. I mean, I hate hotels. Can we not just... we could watch a movie. I swear I am misinterpreting nothing. I see your wedding ring. I respect it. I just want a little distraction from my utter humiliation this evening. How about comedy? You could probably use one, too. Sure, yeah. I just need a quick pee. Oh, yeah, no, be my guest. How is this my life? Kayla? Oh. I... I... I... Listen, I... I did not expect this. Oh, I thought about that wonderful speech you gave and, oh, oh, it's this wine and it's red. Red's my favorite. You drink wine and beer? I can tell you're from New York City. Do you have any drugs? I have always wanted to try crack. - Uh, no, I don't have drugs. - Oh, my God, you're so right. That night we had that fight, why didn't I listen to you? But it's okay because we're gonna know, baby, aren't we? Um... Let's fuck like no one has ever fucked before. You know, fuck like we're teenagers. No, better than that. I mean, you were good as far as teenage boys go, but you're a big city guy now. Come on, you must have learnt a thing or two. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I... I mean, you said... you were very clear, you're... you're... you're married with... with children, two children. But you think those kids even like me? They won't even notice I'm gone. Now let's take those pants off. - No. - Oh, they're stuck. Oh, God, this is a great suit. My husband didn't even wear a suit to his mother's funeral. I've gone too long without a man in a suit. Undress me like the first time we had sex. - Oh, do they have porn here? - Porn? Let's watch porn when we fuck and drink wine and beer. And what else do they have? What else do they have here? Wait, um, you know... Tequila. I think, uh, you've been drinking quite a bit already. So, maybe you've had... maybe you've had too much to drink. - I think you've had quite a bit to drink. - I'm just getting started, baby. Well, I mean I got started a couple hours ago but you know what I mean. You always know what I mean. You always have. My God I never stopped loving you. Where are we going to live? Do you have a condom-minimum... medium? I have a... uh, no, I have a, uh, townhouse. Let's get rid of it and get a condo. Does it have a garbage chute because I have always wanted a garbage chute? Does your husband know? Does... does your husband... does your husband know you're, um... I don't want to talk about Kenny. - Kenny? - Yeah. - Little Kenny? - I know he's not thinking about us right now. You married Kenny, the paper boy? - You know how he had that huge crush on me? - Yeah. So on his 16th birthday I thought to myself, what the fuck... am I ever gonna get the chance to make anyone as happy as I'm about to make Kenny. I mean, I really put a smile on that kid's face. Of course, now it's more of a smirk. But, wait until he reads my "Dear John Letter". - That'll wipe that smirk right off his face. - Wait, you left... you left... You left him a letter? Well, yeah. I stopped off at home on my way over here. Burning bridges, baby. Oh, and to change my shoes because those pink ones hurt like hell. I'm all ready to go vroom vroom. You don't want to talk to him first? If he really loved me, he would have, you know, come with me to the high school reunion to show everyone how happily married we were instead of going to a stupid bowling tournament. Yeah, it's... but it's, uh, it's a tournament. Ah, I love your hands. I love your eyes. I love your lips. Oh, I love your ass. Mine's still pretty good, too, isn't it? - Yeah, it's... - Slap it. You can slap it. - Give it a pat. - Yeah. Wow. It really is. And I don't do any of that Pilates shit. Hey, call me that thing you used to call me in high school. Come on, say it. It always made me so hot. Oh, my God, what are you... oh, my God. Say it. I think I'll come just hearing it. And I... I haven't had an orgasm since... well, since my birthday fuck, yeah. Ooh, what a treat. But with you I think I've come like five times since I walked in this room. Look me in the eyes and watch me explode. I'm so sorry I said no to that beautiful speech you gave me. I don't know why I did that. Thank God you gave me that card because I looked all over for you at the high school and you know, I got a little worried that maybe you were killing yourself over me. No, I... I... I just I... I drank. Drank. Tequila? - Yes. - The tequila is free at last. Free at last. Let's... let's drink teq... but you know, I, uh, I really... - I really like... I like mine with ice. - Really? - I like mine with ice. - This is cold. - It was just in the fridge. - So, I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna head down the hall, um, and I won't be long. - Uh... - Well, hurry. I... I promise. I'm just getting hornier. Hello. And she's left a "Dear John" letter for her husband. I mean, he's away to bowling tournament. I... I don't know what to do. I sympathize but I don't know what I can do to help. She's so drunk I can't reason with her. I... I need something drastic. What if I set off the fire alarm and then just disappear? - That would be... - Too much. - And illegal. - What else can I do? - I don't know. This isn't easy. - Yeah. Yeah, I'd just leave her there to sleep it off but she's left that note and, uh, at the reunion, she told me her kids were away for the weekend, but I have no idea when the husband's due home. Oh, no. And... and I thought you were finally gonna get it together with your dream girl. Oh, God! No. I mean, she's still gorgeous and everything, but a married woman with two kids? That's not... that's not my... and she's really drunk. What can I do? We... oh, no, that's no. What? Well, I was thinking I could call and pretend to be your wife. I've already told her I'm not married. Men who play around tell lies like that. Big city boys. Yes. I'm a player. - Brilliant. - Yeah. But, you know, I... I... I don't think a phone call would do it. I mean, she's out of control. What if you... what if you show up at my room because you were suspicious or you, uh, you wanted to join me at the reunion and your flight was delayed? Pretend to be your wife in person? Yeah. You're right, I'm sorry that was... that's too much to ask. I see that now. I'm sorry. Ah, actually it sounds kind of fun. - It does? - She's not gonna get violent, is she? Oh, no, no, God. She's so drunk a feather would knock her over. Would you? Sure. Oh, now, is what I'm wearing okay? You look lovely. You know, I'm... I'm... I'm proud to have you as my pretend wife. Oh, my God, my kids are never gonna believe I'm doing this. Oh, I... I'm gonna take my suitcase, make it more believable. Okay, you go and I'll be there in... Fast, she's quite a mover. Okay. I will see you very shortly. Hi. You don't have ice? Uh, no, um, they were out of ice. Well, we don't need no ice, do we, baby? Come here, sit next to mama on the big bad bed. Uh, okay. Um, I just, uh, just think I'll get myself another beer first. So, um, Kenny, what's he doing these days? I assume he's not still a paper boy. Kenny who? I don't know no fucking Kenny. You know, I... I never got that whole bad grammar's sexy thing. This is gonna be even better than that time we did it under the bleachers at the county fair and that was hot. - Sizzle. - Yeah, that was... that was something, yeah. Oh, my God! I can't take it any longer. Fuck me now. I wonder who that could be. We don't want no room service. Mama's got plans. Go away! Yeah, it sounds urgent. I mean, there could be a fire. The... the alarm's not working and they're going room to room. Well, then we'll die in the fire fucking our brains out. What a way to go. Burning love, baby. Yeah, I... I think I... I better just go... go check. It's a lady boner killer. Luke. After you left I thought wouldn't it be lovely to meet your high school friends. So, uh, I booked the next flight. There is a strange woman in your hotel room. - It's my wife. - Your... your wife? - Yes, my wife. - You said you weren't married. You lied? How dare you? I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I just... I mean, I... I just... I have no explanation. I mean, I guess it's obvious. Okay, I'm putting two and two and getting five. Ma'am, whatever your name is, I owe you a big apology. Well, it's... if you didn't know he was married... A huge apology. - Really it's his fault. - Men, right? Because I am about to break your heart. Let me tell you what your husband said to me tonight. Your soon-to-be ex-husband. He said, and I quote, and I paraphrase, he said, "Kayla," that's me, I am Kayla. He said "Kayla, you're the only woman I ever truly loved. I think about you when I wake up in the morning. I think about you when I go to sleep at night. - I think about you when I'm happy." - Stop it. - "I think about you when I'm, um... I'm..." - Sad. Sad. "My biggest regret in life." Biggest. You get that? "Is that I didn't know how lucky I was to have you in my world." - Earth. - Life. "And I wanna... I wanna turn back time with the clock and this time I never wanna let you go. I wanna hold you so tight because we belong together for an eternity or for the rest of our lives." And then... hey, are you listening? Pay attention. Then he gave me his keycard and he... he put his lips to my ear, this ear right here and he said, "Room 104, I'll be waiting, baby." - I didn't say baby. - Yes, you did. So you missy would be smart to just take your suitcase and wheel it back to the bus terminal or the airport or however the fuck you got here because I am not giving him up, bitch. Well, I... I didn't expect this. Hmm. But I... I am not giving up my husband. We... we've had years... - I'm not listening. - Wonderful years together. - I can't hear you. - I... I'm not giving him up - for an ex-girlfriend. - I'm not listening. Kayla, my wife's right. I can't leave her. And our children. Yes. We... we have to think of the children. Yeah, well, he doesn't love you. He loves me. - Kayla. - We have plans. Tell her the... the condominium and... and... and then the garbage chute. Fine. You can have him. But you get the children. All the children. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Kayla, you... you do not want to be their stepmom. Wait, stepmom? How... how... how many are there? Several. - And I'll... - Poor kids. I'll admit they're... they're difficult, especially Billy. All you ever do is criticize Billy. He's trying his best. What about that Father's Day card he made you? And then you took them all to the movie with the... the... the giant... - Thing, giant bug thing. - Bug thing, yeah. - Yeah, that was... - Yeah. That was a good day. That was... See? We still have good days, baby. - We can work it out. - You think so? I know we can. Kayla, honey, I have to try, she's the mother of my children. Well, I'm the mother of Kenny's children and I don't give a fuck. - I just want to be happy. - Well, you... you won't be happy with him. You know how many women he's given that speech to? How many times I've walked into a hotel room and... and found a woman with a dress half off? Yeah, well, that's just because he's looking for me in other women. I mean, tell her. Tell her, Luke. You never stopped loving me. Tell her. Kayla, Kayla. - I... - I do. Now, I wish I could say what you want to hear. We had our moment. We loved each other. God, we loved each other. But my wife's right. Time moves on. We have to end it here. But I will always cherish the memories of, you know, the... the best ones like the under the bleachers of the town fair. Are you breaking up with me? Yes, I am. - Again? - It's really over this time. Oh, fuck. I think I left my husband tonight. You know, in the morning you'll be so glad things worked out this way. - Will I? - Definitely. And I've, uh, I've got your slippers. I don't think I can walk. Oh. Oh, I totally froze on that "how many kids" question. Several? She can't drive. No. She'll have to stay the night. - What if her husband comes home and finds the note? - Oh, God! Maybe you shouldn't have given such an impressive speech. Let's not talk about the speech. It's quite hard not to. The point is how do we get her home? - We? - Well, I can't drive. I've had too much to drink. You've only had a half a glass of wine. We could put her in a taxi. It's a small town. We have to destroy the note before Kenny gets home. We can't ask a cab driver to do that. Do we really need to care about this Kenny person? No, yeah, but what about the kids? Okay, I will drive for the sake of the kids. But they must be pretty screwed up already. There's no point in making it any worse. All right, let's get on with it. Okay, I've got her handbag, presumably, her car keys are in here. And her driver's license. We need her address. Oh, she's lost a slipper. Give me kiss baby, just... just one kiss. - Hurry. - Got it. Of course, it's not just the sex. Are you crazy? I love you. Wait, wait, I'm... I'm... I'm still pretty, aren't I? - Yeah. - You're lovely. - Do you really think so? - Definitely. You are a knockout. Okay, I don't... I don't think that Kenny notices anymore. How could he not? - Oh. - Evening. Sorry. - Thank you. - You got it? She's nice. I don't even like hotels. Which one's your car, Kayla? Kayla. - Kayla. - I'm not telling you. I don't want to go home. It's okay. Thank God one of us is sober. I don't want to go home. I want to go to New York City. He promised me a garbage chute. Yeah. Well, you'll feel differently in the morning. Come on. It's this way, Kayla. Do you remember that time when we had sex in my parents' bedroom just because we thought it'd be really naughty? We were teenagers. I love teenage sex. Oh, my God! "Come here, hot bunny fuck girl." Hot bunny fuck girl. That's... Do you remember the time that we would read all those magazines and do anything no matter how kinky... Can we, uh, move things along a bit? Do you remember the time we did it in the woods? Oh, sorry. Let's just get her to the couch. Let's have a quickie for old time's sake. Your wife won't mind. - She will mind. - No, she won't. You tell her you'll mind. Yeah, Kayla, I would mind very much. Let go of him. Come on, he's not yours. Okay, uh, the note, then we're out of here. Yeah, well, I'll check down here and you do the bedroom. On the pillow, that's where I'd leave it, not that I've ever thought of that. Of course, not. I'll go upstairs. Kayla needs a drinkypoo. - Oh, I... I don't think that's a good idea. - I do. He loves me more than he loves you. Maybe. But you know, Luke and I, we have a history and those kids. Well, every time he fucks you he's gonna be thinking about me. So, think about that, bitch. Why, I guess I'll just have to live with that, Kayla. Fucking Tupperware. - Oh, Kayla. - What am I here for? A drink. - No note on the bed. - She wants another drink. Kayla, why don't you let Abby make your drink? I think you should sit down. - Come on. - Pow. I don't want to sit down. God, this was so hot in high school. Now I just think who's going to clear it up. Come on, this way. Right, well, I'll, uh, I'll clear this up, shall I? Yeah. Over here. Why don't you, uh, sit down here with me, Kayla? See? I'm sitting down. You keep leading me to couches. I think that's your subconscious telling me you want to get it on. There's Kenny. Kenny. Hi. I'm sure you don't remember me. I sure as hell do remember you. Luke Manning. - What... - Uh, this is my wife, Abby. How nice to meet you, Kenny. We were just, um... We were just having a little afterparty. It was, uh, it was quite a reunion. Luke Manning's wife. I always knew he'd marry a looker. It is really nice to meet you. Luke, maybe we should get back to the hotel. It's been a lot of fun but the party's got to end sometime. You're... you're not going anywhere. Well, maybe we could... don't, don't you want to have a look around at Kenny and Kayla's lovely home? Um, I'm sure they won't mind if you go alone. Kayla is a lovely little decorator. Okay, I'll just... uh, yeah. I'll give myself the tour. Luke Manning. I want to catch up with you. Abby, uh, get back here now. Yeah. Maybe you do want to hang out with us for a bit, you know, um, get to know Kenny better. I mean, he, uh, he really is a... a fascinating guy. A fascinating guy. Honey, if it's not obvious, we won tonight. Best bowler in the league. That was amazing tonight. - That seems unlikely. - No, really. It was spectacular. I hate bowling. Well, that's because you don't understand the skill that's involved. Well, I hate anything where you have to wear ugly shoes. - That's a nice trophy. - Thanks. The other guys were gonna go out and celebrate and I was like, "No." I'm gonna take that long drive home so I can get back to my little Kayla. It's her special weekend, right, the big reunion. Oh, I was hoping to be back here for the party but it looks like it's over. Yeah, well, this party ended a long time ago. Well, on that note... Yeah. Yes, on... on that note. Oh, Kenny, I... I've heard so... so much about you over the years. What? Wow. I didn't think Luke Manning would remember me. I was a little younger. I had a paper route. - And I got to tell you, it was pretty scary stepping into... - Sorry. ...Luke Manning's shoes, uh, when I started dating Kayla because, you know, he was a legend, so smart. And he was always in trouble and all the ladies loving him, you know. So how's it worked out, Luke, since other than marrying, uh, this, uh, pretty lady? - Comfy sofa. Really nice. - Yeah, they're kinda. Well, you know, I, uh, moved to New York. I work for a publishing company. Books. Aren't they kind of on the way out? No, no, not quite yet, no. Books? I think they are. I've been doing some reading. Huh. Did you tell him, Kayla? I didn't. I own six trucks. - Six. - Six? Yeah. Probably gonna buy two more in the spring. That's incredible. I... I don't have any trucks. Hmm. So you're the best bowler in the league? - Not many men can say that. - Nope. Oh, I love a trophy. This one is so, so big. Big. Wait a minute. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the situation here, but I show up unexpected, I find my wife dressed like that with her hand on her ex-lover's leg and then this pretty lady comes out of nowhere, never met her before and sits beside me. What's going on here? Are you guys looking for a foursome? No. No, no, no, thanks. We're just catching up, you know, and, uh, but, uh, Abby and I really, we... we have to be going now. You know, long... long trip. Yeah, we're... we're leaving now. This, I want to make it clear like you understood. Like, if you're looking for a foursome, I'm totally in. I find Luke very attractive. Huh. Well, this night has been a lot more exciting than I thought it would be. I can't believe he thought we wanted a foursome. You've been a great sport. Oh, well, my brother lives... lived on this street. I have the keys. Do you mind if we... Of course, not. Those are pretty good. - Was he a photographer? - They're mine. I'm a photographer. He must have got them online. I assumed he never thought of me. We hadn't communicated for years apart from Christmas cards. And he only ever signed his name, Josh. I always sent some stupid cheery note telling him how the kids were and nothing real, not I'm restless, I'm pissed off, I miss you. Now it's too late. How did he die? Heart attack. Yeah, I think he'd had health problems for a while. Apparently, he's on disability pension. Neighbor found him. And I called her. She said, uh, he kept to himself. She didn't really know him even though he'd lived here for years. I don't even know who his friends are, if he had any. The information's on the funeral home's website but who knows who'll see it. Who's this? I don't know. Does she even know he's dead? How come the two of you grew so far apart? He was quirky, liked to argue. He had a mean streak. Old stuff I don't care about now but back then. "Until the last hour comes you never know how much you can forgive." - Charlotte Bronte. - You're in publishing. Actually, it's my mother. She, uh... she loved the Brontes. She was a romantic type. Hmm. Says the man who came in search of his high school sweetheart. Yeah. You said your mother left when you were little. Did you ever see her again? A few times. Awkward meetings, you know. She had a whole new family, uncomplicated, smiley face people who just stared at me like I was from a distant galaxy, you know, one where people drank too much, got fired from their jobs, slept with too many women. Generally, fucked up our lives forever. Maybe not forever. Yeah, maybe. I should look for anything personal, letters, tax returns. I've hired someone to clean out everything, take anything of value to a charity, get rid of the rest. I can't handle it when I'm this tired. I think I'll come back tomorrow after the funeral. Right. You okay? Mm-hmm. It wasn't just me, you know. He could have tried harder. He had my number. He knew where I lived. And now he's gone and I have all the guilt for the rest of my life. It'll get easier. And is that a good thing, the day I stop missing him? I hope she made him happy. - I'm going up. - I'm this way. I guess this is it. You'll be heading home tomorrow. Actually, I'm... I'm booked to stay another night. I thought Kayla would need a day to pack and tell everyone the happy news that she was coming home with me. It'll cost more than it's worth to change the flight. So, we, uh, we might see each other again. - Breakfast? - Yeah. Uh, it's late so, um, 9:00? - Nine. - Yeah. Night. Night. Excuse me. Hi. - Hi. - Yes, Sir. I'm sorry. I'm, uh, I'm due to leave tomorrow morning but I'd like to stay another night. It's Manning, 104. - Yes, I can do that for you. - Thanks. Luke Manning. I didn't know you were staying here. It's Ted. Ted Simpson. Ange. Rega rega boom boom win win win. Come on, join in, join in, join in. Rega rega boom boom win win! Rega rega boom boom win win win! I don't... I don't remember that one. You know, uh, not that I was watching but I saw you and Kayla talking last night pretty intense. And then you just disappeared. I figured that you had slipped off together but then I saw Kayla knocking back the shots. So I figured whatever you were offering, she said no. Guess you crawled away to lick your wounds while she got the last laugh, huh? I, uh... - Hi. - Hi. - This is, um... - Luke's wife, Abby. Nice to meet you. That is your old high school friends, baby? Yes, they are. You brought the wife? Uh, uh, I'm... I'm Ted. This is, uh, my wife, uh, Angela. You remember Angela, don't you, Luke? Oh, I remember you. Angela. Hi. - Nice to meet you, Angela. - Hi. - Join us. - Oh... Oh, it'll be fun to catch up. - Uh... - Why not? - Two chairs. - Sure. Great. You find a better party last night? Oh, I got in late... - And we were just... - Having such a good time together, weren't we? That we forgot to go back... Don't know when our waitress is coming back with our order. Oh, we have a plane to catch. So you're the one who landed our Luke. - Yeah. - Wow. I didn't think any woman would ever tame him, especially when Kayla couldn't. You do know about Kayla, don't you? Of course, I know about Kayla. They were like a Taylor Swift song. But you don't get second chances with a girl like Kayla. So if you blow... the first one, no coming back. Am I right? Mm-hmm. Excuse me, are you actually saying these things in front of my wife? 'Cause I think you should show a little respect here. And let me tell you something about Abby. She's a world-class photographer. - Oh, I'm really not that good. - You are. And she's... well, you can see how lovely she is and she's quick on her feet. I would even say inventive. She's generous with her time, compassionate, an amazing woman. And I am very lucky to be able to sit here today and say this is my wife. I'm really sorry. - Uh, we were being a little rude. - A little rude. It's all right. He's... he's very protective of me. So you're obviously not missing Kayla? Not at all. Yeah, finally. - Ugh. - Could we order? I... I ordered scrambled. - I can't do everything. - Scrambled. It's... I think we should have picked another hotel. I'm very glad I picked this one. Rega rega boom boom win win win! Rega rega boom boom win win win! I think I've got it. - Hon. - I really hope you come to the next reunion. - Time to go. - I hope you get that promotion. Give me a hug. - Show me the next bit. - Yeah. Everybody... I totally understand why you wanted to ditch the reunion to spend a night in a hotel room with a woman like that. Join in to the beat. Rega rega boom boom win win win! Excuse me, sorry. I'll do this. - You try cooking. - Cooking? Rega rega boom boom win win win! I've forgotten how small this town is. - Everyone knows everyone. - I've only lived in cities. Just London? I realized that, uh, I don't know you very well. Well, we haven't been married that long. No, I had a lovely gap year in Paris, a horrible job in Manchester, but mainly London. You, apart from the pub in Hackney? Yeah, uh, well, uh, after I escaped this place, I went everywhere I could. I couldn't really settle. - You never married? - No. Not even close. It gets lonely. There's lots of ways to be lonely. I hope my brother had someone. You know I'm gonna try his neighbor, the one I spoke to on the phone. Maybe she knows who the woman in the picture is. Yeah. Still got time before the service. Sure, let's go. Yes? Hello, I'm Abby Sorensen. My brother Josh lived across the street from you. - We spoke on the phone, I think. - Yes. Hello. I, uh, I just wanted to let you know that his funeral is at 11 this morning at Binders. On Cartwright. Yeah, I didn't, uh, know him very well at all. It was just a chance that I stopped by last week and found him. His mail was delivered to me by mistake and the door was open. So, I just thought I'd leave it on the counter for him while he was out but, um, he was... I don't know if anyone else is gonna show up, which seems a little sad. Well, we'd better get going. Nice to meet you. - That's... - The woman in the photo, yeah. That's weird. Yeah. You don't have to stay. I owe you. You've gone way beyond the call of duty for a random guest at the same hotel. So, just tell me what you want. I'll do it. - Yeah, it would be nice not to sit there all alone. - Okay. I'm sure more people will show up. Oh, my brother had a real talent for pissing people off. People change. I bet he made a ton of friends since you last spoke to him. It'll be packed. - Front row? - Yeah. The funeral director said he'd arrange for a minister to come, so. I should have flown his ashes back to London. I wasn't thinking. God! It was such a shock when I got the call. At least my friends would have been here, it wouldn't have been so empty. Sorry. Sorry, sorry, I'm here. I'm here. Here I am. Okay. Many apologies. Apologies. I just had some... some car trouble. I was just taking care of. Uh, what are we doing here? Uh, yes, yes, yes. Um, we are gathered here today to pay our respects to the dearly departed who I unfortunately didn't know that... Holy shit! What, Luke Manning? What... what the hell are you doing here? I did not... I did not expect to see you here. That was... I apologize. You're right. I'm sorry. That was, um... uh, wow. Where was I? I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to since there's no one here who knew my brother except for me. So... I guess I'm speaking to myself. We hadn't been close in years. I... I can't pretend we were. But there's, um, there's something about the shared flesh... All those little memories of growing up together, the times our mom would give us whipped cream on our cocoa as a treat. The night we got a puppy, Mr. Slippers. Going for long walks together when our parents argued. I always struggled to keep up with his long legs. Really no one... no one knew mum and dad the way the two of us did. He protected me sometimes. He hurt my feelings sometimes. And then he moved away and moved again and again and somehow ended up here, some job he probably didn't like any more than the others. But we all get tired of trying, of change. I went on with my life. I didn't think of him enough. Maybe I thought someday in the future he'll come into town, we'll go out for a drink, forgive and forget. He'll be back and he will love me and I'll love him and we'll both feel so much less alone. I know. I never thought about the phone call coming from a stranger saying, "You will never see him again, you'll never hear his voice, you will never even see his names scrawled at the bottom of a Christmas card that you shove in a drawer and forget about too soon." All the way here I was, um, I was hoping his death was some kind of trick, a way to get me here to... to reconnect. I mean, how can it be that the only thing that gets me on a plane to see my brother is his death? My... my son and daughter never even got to meet him. Even now, I... I keep thinking, uh, if I just look up at the... the right moment I'll see him out of the corner of my eye grinning at me as he slips away from his problems. It's like we all dream of slipping away sometimes. But he's not there, is he? He's right here. My one and only big brother. Okay, beers all around. Beers for everyone because today we are celebrating a man's life. I should really get home. I don't even drink, hardly. You're gonna have one little drink. One little drink's not gonna kill you. Come on, just hang out and let's have some fun. I still can't believe it. My best friend in the whole world who... who didn't look me up when he got to town by the way. I never even thought you'd still be here, especially as a... What? Oh, yeah. Well, you know, I mean it was either this or real estate and I'm just not very good at commission work. And what other job do you get a free house? And, oh, did you know this? This is one of the few professions that has zero unemployment. Zero. So, no regrets. Not a lot of people can say that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So, you gotta fill me in. I'm still confused. Are you here for the reunion? Are you here for the, um, sad event? I couldn't make the reunion personally because someone died last night, needed hand-holding. But I guess every job has its overtime, right? Well, a little bit of both as it turns out. Um, I did... I did stop in at the reunion for a bit. Yeah, yeah. I was wondering if you'd stop in to see Kayla. Oh, I gotta tell you, she is still pretty special and she married Kenny, the paperboy. What... oh, my God! I would have just sliced off my right nut for a shot with her. Oh, excuse me, ladies, that was rude. Testicle. Oh, but just between us, I've been giving them marriage counseling. - Yeah. - Oh. And it's not going well. Not going well. But I mean you guys look like you're doing okay, you know. I mean, obviously, the Missus here is dealing with the loss of a loved one, which is very tragic but, um, that's why we need more beer. Jimmy, beep-beep, we're empty here. Just... just keep them coming, all right. And, uh, I don't know, some food. You guys hungry? Some food, like the... the saltiest and the greasiest you've got, okay, because today... today, we are pretending that we are immortal. To Jesus. He's my boss. Oh, yeah. Come on, you two. Come on. Everybody, come on, let's get up and dance. Everybody let's get up here. Come on. Hey! This is it. Okay. Let's get you seated. Let's get you out of here. You know what I hardly ever drink but this... - Okay. - ...salty food is just making me so thirsty. Listen, I'm, uh, you stay right here. I'll be right back. Hey, guys, I just have to say something. And I know that you went through that really rough patch back when your dad took off and then you had all that stuff with your mom and then I... I was... I just got worried about you, you know. I was worried you would... you'd fall down and... and then you wouldn't be able to get back up. That's why you'd understand I'm so thrilled to see that someone like you could be so happily married because, look, I see it, you love her so much, it's just your eyes, they just shine when you look at this lovely lady. Oh, it's... it's amazing. Excuse me. Just... Abby, I'm sorry about that. It's fine. We're pretending to be a couple so, uh... Just, uh, he... he still talks to Kayla so I... I didn't want him... If she found out the truth, her feelings would be hurt. Exactly. I'm gonna get some fresh air, check my emails. Can I confess something to you? Ah, I mean, I'm not Catholic but if you want to talk. I was having sex with Josh. Okay. I don't know who... oh, oh, the departed. Oh. -Oh, whoa, and are you married? - No. - No? - Never. - Oh, okay. Well, I... I mean, listen, if two adults wanna, you know, I'm... I'm not very judgmental, I'm Anglican. I didn't love him though. Oh, you didn't love him? He could be really mean sometimes, oh. But I don't love anyone. And sometimes it's just really nice to be touched, you know what I mean? Yeah, I do. I hid it from everybody. That day I went over there. He didn't leave the door unlocked. I had a key. And I found him lying there. I looked down at him and his arm was kind of twisted and he looked kind of cold. And I knew he was dead. But still... I still didn't love him. But I miss him. That's kind of like love, isn't it, missing someone? Yeah. Yeah, it is. It absolutely is. I thought so. So we do movie nights on Tuesdays. Yeah. Um, I don't do bingos because that's for the Catholics and I respect that. Okay, uh, Tuesdays. I love movies. - Great. And we should do dances. - Yes. - Yeah. And you should organize them. - Oh, no, I'm not organized. You'd be great at it. And I have a lot of bachelor friends who'd love to go. - Really? - Yeah. - Gotta go, buddy. - What? Oh, yeah. Um, it was so great seeing you. - Look me up next time, would you? - Definitely. Okay. Awesome. Oh, and I'm being serious. If you need anything, if you need anything at all, you give me a call. - Thanks. - All right. - Good to meet you. - Bye. Hi. Just restless. Well, they seem to be doing fine without us. You want to get started on your brother's place? Yeah. Oh, I don't know if we're gonna get this done. I'm on the first plane out tomorrow. Are you? Yeah, I... I didn't want to waste any more time here than I had to. Well, I get why someone would want to leave this place as quickly as possible. "Hi, Josh, hope all is well with you. We're fine. The kids are really growing. Time flies, doesn't it? I hope you have a nice Christmas. Love, Abby. PS, Peter says hi." "Peter says hi." Abby. Oh, God. Oh, I fell asleep. Sorry. I'm so awful. No, not at all. I... I... I think I finished everything that needs to be done. I have a shoe box of the things you probably want to keep. And there was a stack of Christmas cards signed "Love, Abby." He kept them. Thank you for everything. Hey, you didn't ask me to carry a drunken ex-lover home in the middle of the night, so, I think I still owe you. Anything you want... ...just ask me. Hi. Yeah, I... I should have called earlier. Sorry. It was, uh, yeah, it could... it could have been worse. Everything okay at your end? Good. I should pro... Good. Good. I should... I should probably, um... Yeah, okay, sure. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Thank you again. You've been really kind. Are you hungry? We could... I have to be up really early tomorrow, so. I think we'll just call it a night. Well, hello and hello. I thought it might be nice before you leave town to get reacquainted while I'm sober. And I think you owe your hot bunny fuck girl that much. Wouldn't you agree, Mrs. Manning? You know I think I'll have a drink after all. Cindy, can you make us three vodka martinis? Three vodka martinis coming right up. If you don't know how, Luke here will show you. He's real good with his hands. Isn't he, Mrs. Manning? Don't worry, I make a great vodka martini. Actually, I don't want... Don't be ridiculous. Everybody wants a vodka martini. So, tell me all about your life in the Big Apple. You two lived there long? - Oh, uh, how many years is it now? - Twelve? Yeah, 12. - And you have kids? - Yeah, three. Yeah. What are their names? I think we've answered enough questions, don't you? Maybe not quite. See, I may drink too much on occasion but that doesn't mean I'm stupid when I'm sober. So let me tell you something about Luke Manning's wife. When Luke Manning's wife hears the beautiful speech he gives to his high school girlfriend, she's not amused. She is so mad that she rips my heart out of my chest and eats it right in front of me. But you, huh, you were amused, ergo, see, smarter than you think. You're not Luke Manning's wife. No, I'm not. Cindy, these look delicious. Why don't you get started on the next batch? - So who are you? - I'm just a friend. - Not even that. A hotel guest. - I can explain. This has nothing to do with... Oh, you'll get your turn. This is a damn good vodka martini, Cindy. Thanks. Are you in love with him? I don't even know him. - That doesn't answer my question. - Actually, it does. No, it doesn't. Who are you? Fucking Dr. Phil? Kayla. You're missing out the most important thing. At the reunion you told me you were married with two kids. Now, I'm not a homewrecker. I would never... I would never get between a woman and her husband and her kid... kid. Maybe the specific circumstances matter. FYI, the specific circumstances are that I'm fucking miserable. Look, if you're telling the truth, if the only thing stopping you is Kenny and the kids, then I'm here to tell you, I am willing to go wherever you want to take me and... and that covers everything from an hour in your hotel room to back home with you for the rest of your life. I mean, I'm... I'm willing to, uh, start with option A and give you a chance to think about option B. And I'm sure you'll recollect the one area I never disappoint... Is in the bedroom. Do you two want to... I need to pack. Please don't go. Luke, we meant everything to each other once. I mean, I know I'm all smudgy around the edges from too many years in this fucking town married to a paperboy, but we can make it happen again. If we really want it, we can get it back. Hey, Cindy. How's it going? Can I go home early? Could you please make me a coffee before you close up? It's been the longest 24 hours of my life. Okey-dokey. But it's gonna be a fresh pot. I could really use a coffee. I mean, seeing as there... would you like a coffee? Sure. Ah, can I get two coffees please? Okay. But FYI, my coffees are not as good as my vodka martinis. That's all right. Luke never did like to tell people anything that would hurt their feelings. Kayla, I don't know you, so maybe I should mind my own business but... Well, you seem pretty involved, though I'm not exactly sure why. So, say whatever you have to say. Do you really wish you were on a plane with Luke right now? Yes. God, yes! What if it... it didn't work out with Luke? You'd be left all alone. I'm alone right now. Having other people around the house doesn't change that if they don't love you. The... the time I had with that man even if he was just a boy then was the luckiest time of my life. And if I've lost him for good, it has nothing to do with Kenny or the kids or because I got drunk or I'm not 17. That's because of you. And since you've been giving me unsolicited advice, let me give you some. You have a chance with that man, you grab it now fast. That man falls in love with you, you do not walk away. He's too good to lose. Is what you have at home really better than what you could have with him? Because, uh, you and I may seem really different but something about you really reminds me of me. I think I need these more than you. Where is she? Meg. Here's another one. - Who the hell are you man? - I'm just a guest. - I'm a guest at the hotel. - He's... he's Room 104. I don't even know him. - Sorry. - It's okay. Oops, you forgot your cream and sugar. Okay, thanks. Meg, his car's out front. You. You are fired. - You can't fire him. - Yes, I can. An employee sleeping with your girlfriend is not a firing offense. I bet it is. I'm going to call the Ministry of Labor. You always want to make up all the rules. You never think about anyone other than yourself. Ah, this is all going wrong. Just, um, just listen to me first. I... I can... I can fix this. I have, um, I have a, uh, I have something I need to say publicly and you guys are gonna be my witnesses. All right. This is... this is my public apology. I know I have neglected you, Meg Danson, but I see the error of my ways. I will even give up this hotel, which I have sweat my soul for, because nothing matters to me more than you. I love you. I'll always love you, Meg Danson. So, um, please accept this apology and tell me you love me, too. I love her, too. And maybe I don't have a hotel to give up, but that doesn't mean I love her any less than you do. Meg, we can just leave. The only thing that matters is that I'm with you, Meg. I was crazy to think that we could all still work together. But I have to go with him. I didn't mean to fall in love with someone else. But sometimes it just... it happens. Come on. We can get our things and we could just leave right now. I'm sorry. That... that was awesome. I used to be awesome. You're still a very beautiful woman. I know. But beautiful though you are... I love Megan. That's okay. I love that guy over there. He's a lucky man. He doesn't love me. Not anymore. Oh, sorry. Come on. It's just... I thought that would work. Sometimes speeches work. Sometimes they don't. Sometimes it's a matter of timing. - Maybe I should go out... - No, you should go home. So should I. Otherwise it is just downhill for both of us, okay. Come on, I'll walk you to your car. Take my advice. Well, this is me. It's been, uh... I will never forget this weekend. You sure you don't want to get some more of that delicious junk food from the vending machine? Oh, I need to pack. I have to be up at six. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, my God! I'm so glad you came. I knew... I knew you couldn't just leave. I... I knew you felt the same way. You have my suitcase. Um, yeah. So... Thank you. I should have thought of it earlier. That's fine. So, bye again. What you said just now when you opened the door? - I was... - I have never led you on. - I never said you have. - I'm married. I never hid that. - I wear a ring. - What are you accusing me of? Maybe I shouldn't have gone to your room last night but you said you were a gentleman. - I'm a gentleman. - You wanted company. - I haven't laid a finger on you. - Yeah, because I'm married. I know. How could I forget. You're reminding me every three seconds. You... if you wanted a married woman with kids, you could have Kayla. - I don't want Kayla. - She's crazy about you. - Huh, we're strangers. - Never said we weren't. I just wanted everything to be clear because this is the last time we're ever gonna speak to each other. It is clear. You're married. I'm a gentleman. There's nothing else to say. No, nothing. - Nothing. - Fine. I don't know if I've fallen in love with you but I... I... I... I... I want to have sex with you. I... really want to have sex with you but I can't. I should go back to my room right now, but I'm... I'm not ready to give you up. Is there anywhere we could go and we could be absolutely certain we wouldn't... - Do anything? - Yeah, do anything. Wow. This is, uh, yeah, I really appreciate this and we... we just wanted. Oh, no, no explanations necessary. Just happy to help out a friend. So here's the key. Uh, just remember to lock up and put it under the mat when you're done. Yeah, we still do that. - Thanks. - Okay. Thanks. Anyway, so there I was... so there I was behind bars in the town jail feeling like an idiot. A lot of your stories have you feeling like an idiot. They do. Thanks for pointing that out. Anyway, there's these two cops, right, and they're... they're really laying into me, you know, "We know who you are, kid. You're gonna go to prison for this." They even threw in a few nasty remarks about my dad's unpaid debts. And then the two of them just go out, I don't know, for donuts or something. So I'm sitting there all alone locked in a cell and I'm petrified, you know. I don't even have a parent who'll take custody of me. And then who should walk in, but Greg. - The same Greg? - Yeah, Father Greg. He strolls into the station, he sees the... he sees the weed on the desk. He sees I'm all alone. And he just... he walks straight up to it and he shoves it in his mouth as fast as he can and he eats it, all of it. He's just... oh, God! And then the cops come back and they... they see the weed's gone and they say, "Where's the marijuana?" And, Greg, he stands up as straight as he can and he says, "I ate it." And these two cops they just, uh, they just started laughing. I mean, what else could they do? They... they unlock the cell, they let me go. I mean, they couldn't admit that they... they were stupid enough to leave the evidence out. Wow! That is friendship. Yeah. I should have stayed in touch with him. I will from now on. These are amazing. I'm proud of this one. - I love these. - Thank you. Wait, let me take one of you. - Would you email it to me? LukeManning@... - No. I don't... I don't want to be having a fight with my husband over how to load the dishwasher and thinking, "Well, I'll email Luke or I'll go to New York." Sorry, I... I didn't mean to be presumptuous. - You haven't in any... - You're not being presumptuous. I love you. I think you feel the same. Let me tell you about marriage. I don't think I want to hear this. Marriages have good years and bad years and mine is having a bad one. I think huge. Just getting on each other's nerves, spending too much time apart, but it doesn't give me permission to walk away. You know, if we... if we were having a good year, I probably wouldn't even be tempted. Don't. What we have is more than that. Don't put it down to restlessness. - I didn't mean... - I could move to London. You wouldn't have to disrupt your kids. My kids are disrupted by my coming here for two days. You have no idea how easily children get disrupted. You do, I'm sorry. My flight. I have to go. Are you sure? No, I'm not sure. That's why this is hard. Just say it once. I love you. You, uh, you had space for all your brother's things? Yeah, managed to squeeze everything in. You want a... a snack for... for the trip? There's a few things left in the vending machine. I'll get something at the airport. Taxi's here so... bye. You know, it doesn't seem right. The only person I kissed on this trip is Kayla. Love someone. Love her with all your heart. She'll be so lucky.
