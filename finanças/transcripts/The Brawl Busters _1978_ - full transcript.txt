(film crackling) (dramatic gong clanging) (drum pounding) (dramatic clanging music) - Gen-Who's kung fu is the best on the world. When you fight him, do so calmly and carefully. (laughing) - So you dare to challenge. - That's right. You're scared you can't beat me. (laughing) - I keep my word, when I say I'll take on anyone. You're no exception. Tell me young man, with which style of kung fu do you intend to beat me? It had better be good or you will die. Aren't you afraid of challenging me, the greatest? I am sure you will die. Do you know that no one has ever beaten me in kung fu? - Even the sun must leave the sky, I will not budge. - You will die! (grunting and scuffling) (dramatic instrumental music) (shouts) (scuffling) (shouting) (shouts) (shouts) (laughs) You scare off all the other young idiots who waste my time by challenging me. You guards will make an example of this one! (water splashing) (dramatic instrumental music) (footsteps approaching) - Who goes there? Identify yourself. - Who are you to dare stop my sedan chair? Now let me pass. - Please forgive me. - Let's go. - Who are you then? (whooshing) So you wanna fight, huh? (grunting and scuffling) - Who's there? You are? - My lord, Mai-Yen was not feeling all that well today so I came here to serve you. Please forgive me, if my lord doesn't like me, I will go. - What? Don't be so silly, come closer. - Sir. (gentle instrumental music) Turn off the light. - Yes. (dramatic music) (dramatic drumming) - She-Ya has been murdered. It's unbelievable. - I heard that the assassin disguised herself as Mai-Yen, master. - You mean to tell me that Mai-Yen was involved in this? - Mai-Yen was on a mission when a woman stopped her party and held them up. It must have been coincidence. - Damn! When a woman kills one of our people it looks very bad. We are the Tum-Chang Party. You must find that damn woman and kill the bitch! (gentle instrumental music) - Father, I will never cry easily. To cry out of hopelessness or grief is wrong. From now on I will devote my life to getting those murdering bastards who killed you. Dear father, I will show them what you taught me in martial arts. The grief and pain inside me has turned to hate. I will avenge your death, father. For one, no for 10 years, I will devote my time to finding them. I'll sacrifice their lives in your memory. Goodbye, father. And who are you? - Your father was always respected. - Only if the good are rewarded, the bad punished. (dramatic suspenseful music) (whooshing) We shall meet again. (dramatic instrumental music) - How dare she come after murdering our friend She-Ya, the cunning bitch. We ought to be ashamed. What were you thinking of? Why the hell didn't you get her? God damn her. God damn her! We must kill the elusive bitch! - Please don't worry, my lord. - They aren't capable of doing a goddamn thing. She will think we're fools. - Leave it all to me, my lord. I have a good plan. (low mumbling) (suspenseful instrumental music) - Welcome, sirs. - We will be staying here for the night. - Yes, sir. - First you can get us some food and drink. - Yes, sir, follow me. - Is the mistress of Very Tea Lodge really so great? - Yes. - You go to Very Tea Lodge right away and say that you were sent by a rich woman to talk with their mistress. - Yes. - She can name the price. - If we pay her a good price, I believe she will do a very good job for us. She is a very unusual type of person. She has never failed at all in her life. She is very good. - Is she powerful? - You can bet on that. But she has never worked for a bad cause. The funny thing is that she gives all her money to poor people, I heard that she was a thief. (low intense music) (laughing) (soft intense music) - Who are you? (laughing) - We met once. - What do you want? - You really wanna know? - You only become well known after winning the kung fu contest we organized and winning the world's greatest sword, which is an insult to the Tum-Chang Party. - As you well know, I obeyed the rules of the contest. - You're an outsider. You must return it. Now. - You cannot force me to give it back. - Water! (shouting) (dramatic instrumental music) (laughing) - Oh no, oh my god! (laughing) - Search everywhere. Kill everyone. - Those murderers! (suspenseful dramatic music) - You stay there! (suspenseful dramatic music) (birds chirping) (baby crying) (dramatic instrumental music) (baby crying) - Buddha have mercy on your soul. - [Woman] Whoever finds this little girl please care for her. She is the daughter of Kow-Kwa Chen who was murdered by the Tum-Chang Party. - May Buddha bless you and this little baby girl. - How ridiculous! You stupid fool, how can your partner Chung-Ting be murdered when you're both sleeping in the same room? - My lord, the mistress of Very Tea Lodge didn't seem interested in meeting us. - Lord Chi. - What is it? - Someone asked for 2,000 tales of gold to tell you how to get the mistress of the lodge. - Who was that? - Shao-Shen, a lady. - A woman? - Yes. A woman trusted by the mistress of Very Tea Lodge. - Okay. It's a fair price if we can get her. (fire crackling) (shouting) (grunting and scuffling) (people chattering) - Come in, take a seat. Now, what are you having? - Get me some meat dumplings. - Yes yes. (low drumming music) - She is the mistress of Very Tea Lodge. - Right. - Good. (suspenseful drumming music) (shouting) (yelping) - How's business been, my friend? - [Restaurateur] Not bad. Not bad. - [Bandit] Where's my share then, huh? I hope you're not trying to cheat me. - [Restaurateur] I wasn't. - [Bandit] Give me the money, quick. (chuckling) I think my dear that you should pay some road tax. - I have neither money nor time for people like you. (grunting and shouting) - God damn it! (glass breaking) (grunting and scuffling) (ascending music) (glass breaking) - What time is it now? - Just after two. - Damn! (door knocking) Come in. - Someone asked me to deliver this to you. (dramatic music) - [Woman] Tomorrow at noon, the mistress of Very Tea Lodge will lead four women to the entrance of Red Cloud Lodge. She is Kow-Ying Len, your father's murderer. - Yes. Now is my chance for revenge. (dramatic suspenseful music) Is this the place? - Yes, this is the entrance of Red Cloud Lodge. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. They'll be here shortly. (dramatic instrumental music) - I have no wish to harm you. - We're in a hurry, will you please step aside? - Hurry up, get out of the way. (chuckles) - Why are you rushing? - Who are you? Sir? - I would like you to help me. (clapping) (dramatic drumming music) Here are 10,000 tales. I want you to avenge my father's death on my behalf. - I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do it. Yeah, She-Hao the devil killer. - And you're the mistress of the lodge. - How do you know? - You should know that money can buy almost anything. - 20 years ago, the dumb Tum-Chang party murdered my father, I was only taking revenge for him. (dramatic instrumental music) Since my friend, you have now discovered my real identity I can't let you live. (laughing) - Bloody bitch, I never dreamed it would be so easy. Kill her. - Sir. (dramatic instrumental music) (scuffling and grunting) (mystical instrumental music) (grunting and scuffling) (grunting and scuffling) (shouts) (grunting and scuffling) (mystical music) - You are? - Thank you for your help. We have met before. - Tell me, who the hell are you? - I am a wanderer, with no place left to go. I hope we meet again. (low suspenseful music) - What, who are you? (dramatic suspenseful music) (laughing) (bell ringing) - What are you doing here so late? - My lord, She-Hao has been killed by the mistress. I only just managed to escape on my own. - What? She-Hao, the devil killer? - The mistresses is the daughter of a man called Kwa, whom you killed more than 20 years ago. She uses tornado feet. - I remember she was She-Ya's funeral. (dramatic suspenseful music) We cannot allow the Tum-Chang Party to be treated like this. You go and find that woman and kill the damned bitch! - Her kung fu is excellent. It's hard to believe she's a woman. I saw it with my own eyes. Even her four assistants were much better than we are. - All this means is that the mistress of Very Tea Lodge is only pretending to help us while really waiting for a chance to take revenge. We have been tricked. - Why the hell don't we get rid of her now? - My lord, please let me handle her. - Chum-Chi, you go and take revenge for She-Ya. Shai-Chang you go with Chum-Chi to get that mysterious man. - [Shai-Chang] Sir. (suspenseful instrumental music) - Oi, bitches in there. The lord of hell commands you to come out! You will not get away. (windows breaking) (screaming) (dramatic suspenseful music) (screaming) (dramatic instrumental music) She's dead already. She can't get away from that poison. (dramatic suspenseful music) (gentle flute playing) (chuckling) (grunting and yelping) - Who the hell are you? - How dare you try to scare a woman you bastard. (grunting and scuffling) (dramatic instrumental music) (grunting and scuffling) (shouts) (dramatic suspenseful music) (shouts) (grunting and scuffling) (low intense music) - How ridiculous. First the Tum-Change Party gets attacked by a bloody woman and now there's a mysterious assassin no one knows about. I want to know who the hell that bastard is! - Don't you worry your lordship. I will make sure that mistress of Very Tea Lodge will suffer more than you can possibly imagine. - Good men. Now you listen. We must catch them both alive so that we can torture them to death. Do you hear me? - [Men] Sir! - We will not let them take any refuge in death! (mellow instrumental music) - Is she alright? - If the poison gets inside her bones, she'll get amnesia. - You mean she'll lose her memory? - It's already a miracle for her to last so long. (mellow instrumental music) - Is she any better yet? - We should know more in a day or so. - We better send her away. I don't think she has the money to pay your bill. - What do you mean by that? - My brother, do I have to remind you that I am the one who earns all the money? - Now you've learned the 12 Fish of Shaolin you can go and challenge Gen-Who. Go to your work now. In the name of Buddha, go and teach the people of the Tum-Chang Party a lesson and while you're on your mission you can help Kow-Ying Len to destroy them. (mellow instrumental music) (gasping) - Mistress? Mistress? (gentle instrumental music) - There has been a traitor trying to deceive me. I will not forgive anyone who dares to betray me. - [Man] If your brother is as patient as Kow-Ying Len, you should know what to do. - The Tum-Chang Party! - My friend, I think it best we get her another doctor. - No, you can handle it. (gentle intense music) (suspenseful instrumental music) (dramatic instrumental music) - Shao-Shen. - Brother, what's wrong? (dramatic foreboding music) - Why did you do it? Tell me. What is your reason? You certainly didn't do that because you were afraid she had no money. - She's the Mistress of Very Tea Lodge. - Sure about that? - Brother, she stays here, we will all die. - What's this all about? - I will tell you the whole story. The Tum-Chang Party already knows that the Mistress of Very Tea Lodge is staying here. They're the ones who asked me to kill her. - But how do you know so much about the Mistress of Very Tea Lodge? - Our expenses for the next two years come from her own pocket. - What's that? - Please, forgive me. I have already told the Tum-Chang Party about her and they paid me very well for it. Money was my reason. - What was that you just said? Those two are staying at Shao-Shen's house? - Yes. I saw them both going in there late the other night. - Well done, man. You will be rewarded. (laughing) (crashing) - [Man] Don't kill me. (glass breaking) (yelping) (laughing) (groaning) (shouting) - That bastard loved money too much he was a traitor! Now go and tell Chum-Chi that I want to see him! (suspenseful instrumental music) (whooshing) (whooshing and grunting) (grunting and scuffling) (intense suspenseful music) (whooshing and grunting) (groaning) (dramatic music) - Where have you been so late? - Just outside. - Anything wrong? - Miss Kow has disappeared. - Miss Kow? - There's no trace. - What shall we do? - What's the matter? Something seems to be troubling you. - Trouble, what do you mean? - I know enough about the kung fu of Wu Tong to know that it was you out there. - What's that? - I know it was you because of the way in which you use your sword, which I have here. - Tem-Lung. - I want you to tell me why you were trying to kill Miss Kow a moment ago. - You knew all? She is the Mistress of Very Tea Lodge. My sister betrayed her secret to keep our family, I wanted to help her. Since she arrived, Shao-Shen's been so upset. She's been so secretive, so peculiar. There's even a tunnel leading to a hut in the garden. - Let's go check. (dramatic suspenseful music) (grunting) (grunting and scuffling) (wood breaking) (swords whooshing) (grunting and scuffling) (doors breaking) (loud creaking and slamming) (laughing) (dramatic music) (shouting) (groaning) (dramatic music) (intense instrumental music) (shouts) (dramatic music) (low intense music) - [Woman] Debts in blood should be paid in blood, I will attend the duel, The Mistress of Very Tea Lodge. - Goddamn! What the hell is Wong-Ying doing there? You go and stick up the poster, the duel will be at the stone pagoda. Now get out of my sight! There'll be no more foul ups, go on, get out of here! - [Men] Sir. (clattering and whooshing) (shouting) (whooshing) (laughing) (whooshing) (whooshing) (shouts) (grunting and scuffling) (dramatic suspenseful music) (grunting and scuffling) (shouts) - Where the hell is Gen-Who? - Gen-Who has already set off for the stone pagoda. - The pagoda? - Please have mercy! Please! (grunting and scuffling) (dramatic instrumental music) (whooshing) (grunting and scuffling) (groaning) (grunting and scuffling) (suspenseful instrumental music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (whooshing) (grunting and scuffling) (whooshing) (shouting) (grunting and scuffling) (intense instrumental music) - Thank you for coming. You needn't have. - One of us must die on the grounds of this pagoda. (laughing) - It will certainly be you. (low intense music) (whooshing) (grunting and scuffling) (groaning) (dramatic music) (whooshing) (groaning) (intense suspenseful music) (grunting and scuffling) (shouts) (grunting and scuffling) (shouts) (groaning) (grunting and scuffling) (grunting and scuffling) (grunting and scuffling) (grunting and scuffling) (laughing) (dramatic music) (intense suspenseful music) (laughing) (grunting and scuffling) (shouts) (whooshing) (intense suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (mystical music) (shouting) (dramatic music) (gentle instrumental music) - Buddha is with you, my children. - Master! - Teacher. - You have done well. - Teacher, I'll become nun. I'll follow you for the rest of my life. - Stop it. I taught you kung fu for your revenge, now I must do penance for it. Come along, you will. From now on, this place will have peace. Thanks to you.
