UFA Cinematic Art presents IMMENSEE A German Folk Song Screenplay by Color photography Decors Music Production management Featuring Production and direction Philharmonic Orchestra Hamburg THE WATER LILY Lyric Suite We have about an hour, right? Drive ahead with the luggage and wait for me at the gate with my ticket. - When's the plane to Amsterdam going? - At 10:20. Water lilies, as Mister Torsten explicitly wished for. We had put orchids on the table. Something personal, I suppose. - Elisabeth. - Reinhardt. - That was fast, Reinhardt! - It has to be fast... in an hour I will be on the plane again. But we don't want to rush at this very hour, Reinhardt. When I said I'd have an appointment with the General Music Director, they made deep bows all the way to the floor. A little of your light is even shining on me now, Reinhardt. You've become a great man... Don't embarrass me, Elisabeth. It's just the time... the long time we haven't seen each other. I thank you for the water lily, Reinhardt. The water lily... Elisabeth... When you played the suite for me, I thought it is for me alone, and not for all the strangers around. And so it was. ...The water lily. What would the water lily be without you, Elisabeth? It is... it really is the symbol of our youth. Yes... It was beautiful, your concert, Reinhardt. I haven't been out since Erich's death. "Since Erich's death"... how that sounds... I was on the passage at that time... when I came to Buenos I got my father's letter... all was already over. And I didn't even write to you. That's how I recognize you, Reinhardt... you haven't changed at all. But I have a letter for you. Actually, I wanted to send it to you for the concert. But I'm happy to be able to give it to you now. To give it back, that is. It was painful for me at the time you sent it to me. Because... this is not how our parting was meant to be. Look... people are connected by more things than just that what we had to say goodbye to then. O Lord, how long ago! To my dear Reinhardt, faithfully Elisabeth. Like a thousand years. And suddenly, at a fleeting hour... in between hotel and airport, everything comes back again. As if it were today. The sun is rising. The sun rises... ...over our entire life. Yes, Reinhardt... I was waiting the whole time for the bird to start singing. A bullfinch! Until now I woke you up. Early in the morning with my whistle. And when I'm gone now he will do it for me. And every time he whistles, you should think it's me. - What's his name? - No name... just bullfinch! - But he needs a name... - Name him Reinhardt! Reinhardt is your name only. Nevermind, we'll find something. - Haven't your mother heard you? - She's still asleep. - Come! We put the bird down here - I have to show you something. I finished it just the other night. - You made it yourself? - Yes. What a prospective musician is able to do! You shall sit here... ...in the evening... - Marvelous! - ...or in the morning if you like... ...and then think of me. If you still want to think of me, that is. All right, then. ...in the morning and evening. And then we will write each other. And we'll appoint a day and an hour... ...and then... ...we'll point out a spot in the sky, the moon, or Mars... ...or Venus. Yes... That one suits best. Then I will look up from my music desk... ...and our gazes will meet each other up there, on Venus. Our hearts, Reinhardt. Look over there... ...the sun. I would like to be there, where the sun now rises... And when you'll be there, where you think the sun rises... it will go on the same way. And you'll be saying again: "I'd like to be where the sun rises..." That way we'll be separated more and more. Do you think I could stay here, all my life? That's not for me. Perhaps for Erich... ...but not for me. Nah, I have to get out! Out into the world. Other countries, other people, something new all the time. I don't want to hear this... You're frightening me - my mother would say... Now what would she say? "That's how gypsies are," she'd say. "Gypsies"? What you're saying... I don't say that. I mean, my mother says that. Don't make that angry look. I want to come along to where you're going. Be very quiet. It's so beautiful to look at the rising sun, and be quiet together. - You'll get cold, Elisabeth. - Erich, you scare us. I didn't mean to. I just wanted to surprise you. This is Reinhardt's last free day, you must make use of that. I wanted to invite you to the Immensee estate this afternoon. - Are you coming? - Oh.. no, we won't be able to. I see... well. Don't be upset Erich, but later, after Reinhardt is off to the city, I will have enough time to come to Immensee. This afternoon we'll drive past the lake once more, with Reinhardt's dad ...towards Rehwiese, you know, the road we always took. Now kids, you can tell me whatever you like... If one wants to enjoy a ride like this, one shouldn't be in a car. Of course, a car is nice when one needs to get somewhere fast but over here, one should take time, and look around. Mr. Torsten, being a violin maker and Bach friend, you aren't modern. You rather belong to the old... I mean to the good old times. Don't say that, Mrs. Uhl, I'm quite modern already, at least I hope so. But... the haste, you know, the haste doesn't suit me. The young people of today have found a quite distinct, sometimes rather formal word for "tempo." I prefer the word "diligence." Ah father, one with a one hundred horse power gets you much farther than this carriage. Yes of course, farther, but not closer. You know... not close enough... so you can have the leaves of the trees you love sliding through your fingers, when one drives by... Ah, Reinhardt wants to go to China, or Honolulu, or wherever... Hear, Reinhardt? She doesn't agree at all. But Elisabeth.. people aren't all the same! One likes to stay in the homeland, and the other wants to see the world! Exactly! Leave it, dear Elisabeth, he will soon learn otherwise. I think Elisabeth is more like us, a homely girl. Isn't that true, Elisabeth? I don't know what I am. Dad, with all due respect to your coach, but I'm quite glad we can sit on the meadow and have a coffee for now. Where are you going? We're already at the Rehwiese. Yes, but shouldn't we go down to the lake? No please, it's too humid down there. One's not getting younger. Of course. Well then, let's stay up here where it's dry. Stop it! You know I don't like this. There's climbing plants underwater all over the place. It's creeping me out when you're away for so long. "Away for long"? You'll soon have to get used to that. Come, let's swim to that drift wood. Actually, it isn't very nice of us to swim right in front of the Immensee estate. Why not? If Erich sees us he'll be sad. - Don't turn the log around! - Scaredy cat! Ah, scaredy cat... I can't come to the afternoon tea with my hair all wet. By the way, we have to go back. Just leave the old folks amongst each other. We're going to swim into the wide world, and the first stop will be water lily island. No, not to the water lilies! I don't want to. They wrap around one's legs and cling on. Goodbye! Don't swim towards the water lilies! Do you worry about me? That's sweet of you. Water lilies are your favorites, I know, and today is our last day. If you don't return immediately I will swim back. I will join the others by myself. Come back already! Not without a water lily! Shame on you! You're mean. What stupidity! Stubborn rascal... Dammit... I can't... get on... Yes... they're holding me... The twines are holding me... I'm sorry Elisabeth, but I'm coming without water lily. Well, Erich, what are you looking at? Just at the Rehwiese over there. What's there to see? Not much, Dad. Just Reinhardt and Elizabeth, celebrating farewell. And you're not there? Guess they don't want me there. They want to be alone. You're watching them like knight Toggenburg... I wouldn't look out for one who doesn't want me. One needs to stay proud. Won't be long till I finally can put all this behind me... ...then I will be pushing up the daisies. - But Dad, sometimes you're... - Well should I cry? And then you'll be master of the Immensee estate. - Stay proud, Erich. - But Dad, why talk about dying? - It is not the time yet. - Unfortunately it is. - I really don't want to leave this beautiful earth. - But Daddy... What's the saying again? People are getting older, legs are getting colder, after dying life is dust, young ones can, old ones must. I'm angry. Don't be angry Elisabeth. We don't have time for that today. Same time tomorrow I will be in Hamburg, at the conservatory. Life begins tomorrow! Life begins tomorrow... without me. I'll take you to the train station. No Elisabeth, little girls should still be in bed that early. I can't stand farewells at train stations. Where father, mother and brothers stand there with their handkerchiefs, and waving and all that, "Please write a postcard!", you know all that... that's not for me. We'll say each other goodbye on our own. We will say each other "see you again..." ...don't we? Don't cry... you don't have to cry, Elisabeth. I may, just a little bit... It eases it. Thinking that you won't wake me up tomorrow morning as always, with your whistle... As of tomorrow someone else will do that, Elisabeth. See, you're already awake, too. A bird like that doesn't belong into the bedroom. His screaming wakes up everybody. Don't be sad Elisabeth, nothing against that bird, but he has to go down to the living room. You don't have to hide Elisabeth, I know what's the matter. But believe me, it is good he's gone. See, one should not commit oneself too early. You don't know much of the world and of life yet, and perhaps something better is awaiting you. I don't want anything better. There's nothing better than Reinhardt. Yes... one always thinks that. But believe your mother, such a separation has its good sides. First wait what Reinhardt will think of it when he's back for holidays. He will come - for Christmas, or the summer holidays...? No... No? He won't come? But yes... he will come, earlier. He promised me he will come on his birthday. Check... What is it? I see my father before me. He didn't think sadly about dying. He always looked at me so... peculiar lately. Did he actually like me? I think so. He just didn't like me looking out for you all the time, Elisabeth. Did Reinhardt write to you? He wants to come for his birthday. When we're apart... and I live without you... just be content... you are my other self. Elisabeth... Go, oh winds, and deliver this kiss... to the beautiful child far away, who has to wait for me. Elisabeth... Kiss her cheeks, is what my desire tells me... deliver her my message... ...I will always remain faithful. Elisabeth... You are really moving me. You're only mistaken on the date. My birthday is tomorrow. In two minutes it will be "tomorrow". Good heavens, it's already midnight? But you are making everyone rebellious here with your singing. Don't worry Mr. Torsten. Where people sing so beautifully no one complains. And we talked to the porter before. It was meant to be a surprise. I thank you. But I have nothing to offer you now. That's what we expected. Max! It's about time. Heavens - don't miss out on the time! On your birthday today... we, your classmates... ...congratulate you most sincerely . How sweet you sung. But tell me, where did you get the score? The professor gave it to us. He used your song as an example! - See? - Gosh! Enough serious talking. It's time to get terribly drunk, to Elisabeth! Burnt punch... ...mixed with piquant conversations about art and love... that's what I like. Flames go up! By the way... ...who, actually, is this Elisabeth? Please stop about Elisabeth. You see, he doesn't really like it. Doesn't mean you have to go now. I want to put at least a bath robe on. Maybe you're so friendly to let off steam in my absence. Children, I know who Elisabeth is. Here, "only to be opened on birthday." The cute hostess wanted to give it tomorrow, but I said today is the day. Sender: Elisabeth, or rather Elisabeth Uhl, Immensee. - But Werner... - Play a little louder, so he won't hear us! Wait... "Twelve Songs to Elisabeth"...? - What? - That's hot... Even twelve at once? Cheaper by the Dozen? "The Wooden Bench at the Lake", "Elisabeth, a Bullfinch and I", "When I tried to break the Water Lily" Rosie, Rosie, Rosie white, Rosie on the water... I told you this is hot stuff. Kids, don't lose your manners, that's indiscreet. Put it back! Why indiscrete? These aren't love letters... Maybe they are? Why? - No need to become jealous, Jesta. - Keep your hands off. What a pity. Play. Should these songs, love, as they fleet, Chance again to reach thy hand, - Give me the album! - Noooo! Come 'ere... Now it's getting hot! But Reinhardt, take it good-humouredly! Damn it, you shouldn't bite you beast! Say... is this a fight, or a love scene? I think they both take it differently. For Jesta at least it's a love scene. But gentlemen, you are embarrassing me too much. Mr. Torsten...! - Let go of the album! - No! Hot stuff...! Stop being silly! Give me the book! I think the fun is getting out of hand. I think so too. - Here... better open your package. - What? The birthday child has his solo party next door... Jesta's crying... ...a birthday celebration full of atmosphere. But we won't let our good mood get disturbed. Burnt punch... for everyone! To our son To Reinhardt Dear Reinhardt! The water lily on the cake shows you that I assisted your mother with baking. Think of me when you're eating it. Think of our day of farewell. It is very lonesome here without you. Why didn't you write me? The fact that we had to send you the package shows me that I must not count on you to come as you promised. Greetings, with all my heart Your Elisabeth. It is sad, yes... but don't be sinful, after all it's just a bird. No. It is more. Anyway, it has to leave. It's unreasonable. Furthermore, how's it look like - we're expecting Erich - when he comes, and you're still standing there crying for a dead bird. But I'm not crying... Now finally go outside and bury him. Or I will do it. I'm on my way. Our love's little grave. She was so sad about the little bird. She'll be right back. But I'm happy to have you here alone with me for a second. I'll just look for her. You could do me a big favor, Mr J?rgens. I would love to have a picture of Elisabeth, and you draw so fine... One could have her photographed of course... ...but a drawing is more personal - an artistic adornment for a room. But sure Mrs. Uhl, if it gives you pleasure... I suggest you come over here once or twice a week. I'd also appreciate if you'd become a visiting friend to our house. That child's too often on her own in my view. You mean, since Reinhardt left. Oh well you know, it's only puppy love, and it's a good thing you know about it. But will it be all right for Elisabeth? No reason to be modest. It should be a great joy for her. You think so? Now don't hesitate to speak out, Mr. J?rgens. And be sure I'll be a motherly friend to you. There's not much to say what the three of us - you, Elisabeth and me - wouldn't already know. I'm all by myself down there at the Immensee estate since my father passed away. And I cannot think of any better partner for my life than Elisabeth. Is that so? But I know Reinhardt and Elisabeth made each other a promise. I don't think much of it, to be honest. Reinhardt's surely a lovely person, but he is too restless... ...and he certainly won't make Elisabeth happy. Reinhardt has no qualities to built a marriage on. With me she would have a quiet happiness, on the Immensee estate. And no one else in this world can love her more than I love her. There she is. Look, how thoughtful of Erich. Yes... I don't understand you, Mama. Wasn't it right? Your mother told me you're so sad about losing the bullfinch, and... ...so I thought it appropriate... That's very sweet of you Erich, but... ...where's the wooden cage for my bullfinch? - Yes, Reinhardt! - But where is he? Now where could he be, mother? Finish off, five o'clock, closing time. - Now please... - Wait until they have left. My boy comes home on his birthday and doesn't even say Hello to his mom? Mom, now he's not just your boy anymore. Some day that's over. But Papa, I don't get you. Well it seems so... but it'd be better for you to understand... - Even if you don't, it is like that. - I am apalled. You're not apalled, you're jealous. But that's alright, mommy. Just don't let our boy take notice, it's his birthday today. I am so happy you're back now and that you kept your promise. But you aren't happy at all. Something wrong? I can't stand that yellow bird. I also did like the bullfinch more, but... mother likes the yellow one better. That's because of the golden cage. The Immensee estate. It's so sad that you have to leave again so soon. Now Erich should come visit us twice a week to draw me. Mother wishes a portrait of me so much... I don't like it... What is it you don't like? That someone else gets to know my face so... by heart. I often complained to your father about your unfaithfulness. What are you telling me now? Your father thinks you now don't have no more time for such... childishness. Why haven't you written me? I have written you. Often... ..but only in the way I can write. But that's no letter... "Twelve Songs for Elisabeth" "To Elisabeth"... "Elisabeth, a Bullfinch and I" Beautiful! Now I have a birthday wish to you. Will you sing them tonight? [Dedication to Elisabeth] Should these songs, love, as they fleet, Chance again to reach thy hand, At the piano take thy seat Where thy friend was wont to stand! Sweep with finger bold the string, Then the book one moment see: But read not! do nought but sing! And each page thine own will be! Ah, what grief the song imparts With its letters, black on white, That, when breath'd by thee, our hearts Now can break and now delight! Nice. This is for the singer, Elisabeth. And who is the composer of the the song? Ah father, your old organ doesn't have the range it takes... At our conservatory it sounded much better. Don't be so cheeky, boy. What was good enough for Johann Sebastian will be good for you too. Don't you think so? But you made that quite nicely! Show it to me... - What? - Show me, the sheet music. These are mine. I don't want to take them away. I only want to take a look. Or should I not see what's in it? Yes, but... I see! Oh I see. Well... And now you think they belong to you alone? Well, these are... - These are Reinhardt's letters to... - To you, Elisabeth? Yes. And... One doesn't want anyone else reading it. I understand that. Now, put away your private correspondence... ...and come sit with me. Elisabeth's mom and Erich will be there soon too. Take your time. How sweet of you, to want my songs for yourself alone. Never shall anyone else have them. They're our's alone. When we will be sitting at the table with the others... ...it will feel almost as if you're already gone again. This time I will bring you to the station. One more time the two of us together... tomorrow morning. I want to tell you something. Something important. Our very future will depend on it, but... Don't stop. It strikes six o'clock already. You will be late. We won't see each other for a long time. Will you love me as much as you do now when I will be back? - Sure... - Yes? - I defended you. - Me? Against whom did you need to? Against my mother. We talked about you last night for a long time. - She said you've changed. - What? She thinks, not like you were before. You think so too? No... Come, we have to go now. - There's your train! - So what... It will hold on for a while. I wanted to tell you something. Something very important, I mean... ...that's important for our whole life. I already know it from your songs! Yes, you know it and you should know, but... one has to say it as well. And that's what I want, but only when I have finished. Only when I have advanced, when I know where all this leads to. When I can face your mother and tell her: I am somebody. I want to take Elisabeth with me, out there into the world. - Ah...? - Yes... See, then we won't have to part at the station. Then you will come along. All aboard! Are you looking forward to that? Wait, see me at the window. Oh, I thank you, Elisabeth. Farewell, Elisabeth. Farewell, Reinhardt! In two years! [To my dear Reinhardt faithfully, Elisabeth] Three years went by... Do you believe it now? Come... You don't have think of the worst, Miss Uhl. There's not much more to think. Well they're artists, and somewhat more free in how they conceive this. And I always wondered why he doesn't write me. It won't be as bad as it looks like. See, yesterday they had a shindig, as they call it... ...a large party, many people, it got late, and so she stayed over. - Not nice. - No. If you knew what troubles I already had with other lodgers about this foolery. But he won't become reasonable. "Philistines" is what he says then... ...though he's such a nice person. It's all the fault of those darned females who all run after him. No wonder, he is a handsome boy. - Is it often like this? - What? Don't ask me, I'm so bad at telling lies. It's alright. Where is he now? He is rehearsing in the conservatory. For his final exams. I see... I want to ask you a favor. Don't tell Mr. Torsten that I was here. But... are you leaving without seeing him? Of course. The board of trustees of the conservatory grants Reinhardt Torsten after completing his three year studies the predicate Master Student. As reward for the best composition, he will be the first out of three laureates who are also amongst us, in acknowledgment of his special talents who will be awarded a scholarship for the conductor's academy in Rome. Congratulations! At your age, my dear son almost every year still has its own face, because youth doesn't let itself be impoverished. Many a thing has changed over here, too, what will probably hurt you if I understood you well. But Dad, do you have to tell him now, after he got his scholarship? He needs to know. Imagine him coming home and learning it from someone else... Elisabeth would've written him. But Mama, how do you think this should go? Of course Elisabeth did not write him. Leave it to me, I know what to do. Yesterday Erich and Elisabeth had their wedding. He asked her twice before, to no avail... since he became head of the Immensee estate after his father's died. As much as I can imagine how much your work must have captivated you, you nevertheless shouldn't have forgotten about Elisabeth entirely. I'm very proud of the high award you have received... Your loving father. At the Elbe I did write my songs. Flow, oh songs I loved so well... ...into the ocean of oblivion. No enraptured youth will ever sing you now... ...nor maiden in the time of bloom... You were the songs that witnessed of my love... ...but now she holds my faithfulness to scorn. You were written on the water... ...now flow away as the water flows. How far is it to Immensee? Not far, five minutes left. Then I will take down your suitcase. Does anyone have an envelope? Yes. Want a sheet too? No! - What's that about? - Tcha... I've made up my mind... ...I will travel on with you. Gentlemen, now that's hot stuff... Yesterday you drove us mad, we begged you to go straight to Italy with us... ...and now suddenly not? No...! To Mrs. Elisabeth ...J?rgens Hey boy... come here. Here's two mark. Take this letter, put a stamp on it, and put it into the mailbox. - You can keep the change. - Thank you! Thank God, we made it, we're rolling on. Sit down, leave the window down, don't be so curious. Perhaps he did got off. Nonsense. Suitcase, hat, and jacket are still here. Perhaps he's running there, shouting to drop him his stuff. I wouldn't put it past him! Outrageous. What buildings! All built with a... zeal of faith. - We don't have that anymore. - Why not? We have our own kind of faith, Werner. You are right. I believe in Bach... ...Beethoven... ...in the Ninth, in the 'Song To Joy'. And in that tiny bit that God gave me. You sang heavenly today. Today you sang divinely. My dearest, my dear blonde boy... Why didn't you come to my dressing room this evening? Why didn't you come to my dressing room? It was full of flowers. - Lots of flowers. - Yes. I love you very much. Every hour without you seems a lost hour to me. But it's better if you learn Italian, you know. The language of my fatherland, and above all of my heart... understand? - Yes, yes... - "Yes yes..." Not understand. I wanted to be proud for you. You should have with nessed my triumph. - "witnessed". - witnessed... And how they all love me - much more than you do! Did you know it? She really wanted it. I didn't want to deny... Your song appears entirely changed! It is much more Italian now. That's no longer you, that's Verdi! That she would change it so much, she didn't tell me anything about it. That's pretty steep. But the woman sings fabulous. But this is not my song anymore. This is not Elisabeth. No... that's Loretta. What's the matter with you? You seem so nervous. Nothing so fortunate how I want to see you, when you're with me. Not really nervous, just... if you only had told me earlier we'd have dinner together. Earlier? I wanted to surprise you. You succeeded in that... It's... too bad, I already am meeting some friends at a German restaurant. Where are you appointed? Which restaurant? Well, at the German restaurant, near the Spanish Steps... What a joyful night. Nicer than in a German restaurant... The Italian night, the Italian sky. You are my soul. I love you. Yes... The stars here are lower in the sky. One thinks one could grasp them. Venus... Yes... Venus... is so beautiful. So close... It's hard to believe this is the same Venus as the one in Germany. Is not the same. Is another Venus. Is the star of love. Well? Better put on a hood, or don't come too close. The bees are angry today, buckwheat is flowering. The bees won't do me no harm. Wherever you are is paradise, no? You are right. Here the lion lays down with the lamb. Well, that's not what I meant. Something is depressing me here in my peace. What is it, Erich? Whether you... I mean... whether you are as happy as I am? But Erich... Why do you ask this? See, loosely speaking... You are doing the household all day long... ...then you give me that little sisterly glance... - Still, I often wonder... - What do you wonder about? Now what is it? I want to answer you. Look, up on the wheel, some bird stood there yesterday on one leg, and he pondered starting to build here. You're a foreign bird anyway, I thought... and then he reconsidered and moved on, the long stilted Egyptian. I ordered the wheel up there myself. One day he will stay, if not this year then the next one. Mr. J?rgens, I braced it. I must go to the factory, are you coming? Go without me and come back soon. I've got hands full of work. I'd expected everything, but not that... - Where do you come from? - I've been here for three days. What? And you haven't been to Immensee yet, you unfaithful one? I'm on my way to you now. What a fortunate day, what a joy. It's been more than three years, no? You've become a little slender. - Is it really you? - Of course, it's you too! - It's only you who changed. - Do I? You look much more cheerful now. Oh, I see... ...well... But we will still stay good friends, no? Eh.... and Elisabeth will be glad, for heaven's sake... We sold the house... Reinhardt. My mother lives with us now. The bench... I think we've seen enough photos now. I think so too. We've told enough about ourselves - you don't tell anything about yourself! Haven't you seen anything, in Italy?! I could tell you a lot about Italy... ...but we'd need a whole evening for that. I think we have to postpone this for some other time. I believe I already stretched my visit quite a bit. At home they must be waiting for me for dinner. But you're not about to leave already? That's out of the question! Elisabeth, say something! We didn't even have a toast on his visit. I will dish you up something you surely haven't drunk before. Right, Elisabeth? Here, try it. That is, first you have to take a sniff. Well, you world wandering soul who nibbled at all wells, what is it? - A liqueur... - Yes, but which one, what brand? I'm no expert... a good old Benedictine I'd think. Hear this Elisabeth? Reinhardt knows what he's talking about. - Cheers. - Cheers. Now I will tell you what you just drank. - A real J?rgens. - J?rgens? - Yes, a real Erich J?rgens. - Another one? - No thanks. Where the old barn used to be, we're building our new liquor factory. We already installed a small distillery. These are the first tests. I tell you this good drop has a future, we will become well-known. Don't think you're the only one to become famous. How eloquent you are, I haven't known you like this. Well, in the meantime I hit the jackpot, but you know that. How long do you want to stay at Immensee? My first concert contracts start not until fall. Until then you will have to bear me... And until then you're on vacation? That's great. No vacation... I have to work! But for that there's no place better than here with us! What nonsense to squat down there in the crowded town. Move up here. We will set up the old surveyors house in the garden, we'll bring down the piano, you may compose as much as you like! No one will bother you. Very kind of you Erich, but my parents are around as well. They can come up here as often as they want. See, that's a great idea! Elisabeth, you say nothing. Now invite him and ask him to stay with us. As you think, Erich... Reinhardt, if you want to stay with us we would be very happy. Water lilies... do you remember? Why do you look at the water all the time? Look at me for once. Our silence is dangerous, don't you think so too? These are the bells of Marien, no? How clear they sound today... ...your wedding bells. Why did you do this? Don't ask. Why don't you knock before coming in? I did, but you did not hear. You were so immersed in our letters and in the picture? That image of course doesn't belong in your album. Neither does the bullfinch. Doesn't fit in the golden cage. To whom belongs my image now? - I don't know. - Where's Erich? - In town. - And we're all on our own now, like before? He has courage... Can he be so assured, Elisabeth? We must not do this anymore. What were you looking for in my letters? - I just saw how few they are. - But what were you looking for? Our youth. Not also our love? - Our youth. - They are the same. "In faithfulness, Elisabeth" Did you want to give me back the picture? No. Over our heads, in the woodwork of the new building today the ribbons are crowning the topping-out ceremony. And we, who erected these walls... want today - revered constructor and revered constructoresse... ...following an old tradition, recite the topping out speech. Let me put this down. Just as it's standing here now in miniature, it will once stand there large and completed - You may sit down again. ...and it will tower high over the Immensee as a sign of diligence... ...and development, by giving to the holy fruits of your fields... ...a new purpose - I mean the potatoes. You acknowledged the spirituality of this fruit! Spirit! And it's spirit that counts! And once we get the machines in here... ...then it's not only a matter of squeezing the spirit out of the potato... ...no - it will be your duty to carry out the fruits of our labor... ... in barrels and bottles, as the machines' real engine. And, and, very important, if I may say so... in refined condition in the form of brandy! Bravo! Also as an engine for happy people in happy hours! Bravo! What do you say about Elisabeth? I haven't seen her so lively before. Don't you dance, Erich? No. I can't dance. I never danced in my life. Anything wrong, Erich? What? ... Why? No. I know what I'm doing, Mama. What are you doing? See, so lively, I never can be like that. Reinhardt is an artist. He can express his joy very well. And Elisabeth... ...it seems to suit her well. So why did you invite him? - Am I not allowed to? - Sure, of course. - Of course... - See, Mama... I also think so. Elisabeth is more beautiful when she is happy like that. All people are more beautiful when they're happy...! I'm getting dizzy. Too much turmoil for me here, I have to prepare some things... ...if we want to go over there afterwards... That's alright mama. You're running away from me Elisabeth? I got too warm from dancing. I'm afraid of getting a cold. But it's so warm, Elisabeth. Yes... that's why. Now, what are you then? Warm or cold? - I don't know. - I think you don't know lots of things. - What's that supposed to mean? - Why do you want to go home suddenly? The others already went ahead. They'll be waiting! Let them wait - doesn't matter! Are you afraid of... being alone with me? - You should know if I should be afraid! - Oh yes... I do know that. When I just held you in my arms while dancing, it all was just like then. - You must not think of that. - I have to think of it! - Let me go - You think of it too! - No! Yes you do. You had wished for this dance to never end. It must have an end, Reinhardt. - Why, Elisabeth? - Oh, Reinhardt. Elisabeth, if I would ask you... Elisabeth, do you want to come with me? Out into the world, just as you once promised me. I have a right to ask you this. What would your answer be? Mother is calling! Is this how you wanted it? He always stood between us. Even when he wasn't here. Isn't it so? See... One cannot enforce one's own happiness. But it's not about my happiness... it's all about yours. In the last few days I've seen lights shining in your eyes for the first time. Because of Reinhardt. I let you go, Elisabeth. You can do that? You can really do that? Because I love you... ...I want your happiness. Watching the bees? Yes... I enjoy it, seeing how... ...they come and go... the hive-bees of Immensee. [ lit. Bees' Lake ] There on the lime tree, there's an entire swarm. Yes it is time to swarm. High time of the bees... Now the struggle for the queen begins. The one who flies highest with her, the strongest, will conquer her. To be free for the strongest, that's the right of the hive-bee queen. See? Nature is just! Can't you be clear about what you want to say? Not anymore. I am not allowed anymore. - Why didn't you take the yellow coach? - Madam prefers the black one. I'm going to town alone. Shouldn't I ask Madam if there's anything to do? - No! ...whether there's anything to get from the butcher or the grocer? Nevermind, I'll do it myself. You can stay here. I'll be back home in the evening. I am free. Erich let me go, last night. Forever. Do you know what you just said? Oh yes... Then... you are my Elisabeth? No. He is the stronger one. Now I know. You want to sacrifice yourself? Your happiness? Your life? Me? Your love? - But it's not about Jesta. - But apparently it was... ...at least for you. Never for me. - Never? - Never! I see... If I had known that at that time, then... What then? What would have been if you had known it back then? Then... it would have made me very ... happy, back then. But Reinhardt, do you think that in these circles, among these people, in this kind of freedom, I could have been living? I don't want to rise above them, it all may be very nice, but... that's not my world! Do you think I could have lived up to what you experienced in Italy? See? I am right, isn't it? I was on my way home, back then... ...I was on the train coming from Hamburg... I was so embarrassed when people looked at me me because I was crying. I was saying farewell to you, Reinhardt. I was saying goodbye to what was dearest to me. See, I realized in everything that we don't belong together... that our roads through life don't match. See, you belong out into the world. You have to be in Hamburg today... ...and in Rome tomorrow, and after that in Athens, or wherever... ...and I... And you? I became... rooted... here. Rooted... here... I see. And now? Yes... Now I love Erich. When he let me go yesterday, letting me go because he loves me, for you... I knew that I belong to him, indissoluble, forever. And that's why we have to say farewell. I'm not sleeping, Elisabeth. Forgive me. I love you, Erich. Do you believe me? I believe everything you say. But you're crying. Even happiness has its tears. "To my dear Reinhardt - faithfully, Elisabeth" No, it is not appropriate to take the picture back. But yes, Reinhardt. We were faithful, both of us... ...you to your work, to the star that was guiding you... ...to the whole world you belong to. And I... to my small world, where I became rooted in... ...and to my duties that I accepted since Erich passed away... ...to conserve and expand what he started to build at Immensee. So let us remain faithful, both of us, even if we don't hear from each other for years... ...and when the oceans and continents separate us. Faithful to our youth, faithful to ourselves. I will always remain faithful... Elisabeth... End Subtitles: mysteriousmountain and Kurosuke for KG.
