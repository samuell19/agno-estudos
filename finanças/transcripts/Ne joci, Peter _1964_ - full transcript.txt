DON'T CRY, PETER SCRIPT STARRING DIRECTOR I'm sick of this itch! You keep on scratching, pal. I don't have a single one. Blimey, I didn't mean lice! It's the track. How many times were we at it this month? Twenty-one times. We lay the mines at night, then the Germans patch them up. How dull! It's really not that much fun. How is this a task for a warrior? It's not, but what can we do? Orders are orders. Opportunist! Look at Matija's Company, they're going into battle! They're 1st Company, is that clear? We are 2nd. What's clear, is that others, not us, are given great battles. After the war ends, they'll scoff at me, "You were a Commander of that unit that shifted railroad ties." Well... someone has to. You know what's real warfare? A bridge... at least a 100 metres long. Or a viaduct, ammunition dump, a hangar full of aircraft... - I know what you want. - What's that? - You want to go to Berlin to bomb Hitler. - Well, why not? Because we barely have enough explosive for a narrow-gauge track. Well, then... let's find the brigade and speak to the Commanding Officer. I want battle... or I'll herd donkeys. - Mark my words. - Fine, let's go. It's a bomb! - And another! - The next one will be a snag. Stop! Stop, or I'll shoot! Are you mad? You could kill me! What's the password? Are you mad, how should I know? Lie down! - Do you have a permit? - Will a birth certificate do? - Only if the Commissioner signed it. - Let's pounce on him! - Are you crazy? He's a newbie. - Silence! Lie down! - Don't you want me to get the permit? - You must be serving long. Bloody hell, I thought that we've been fighting only three years. I said four weeks. I knew he was only just mobilized. Stop dawdling! Give him that permit already. I can't find it. We'll have to sleep out here. Look at that, I've got it. Here you go. Learn it by heart. You're Dane, the Commander? Yes, if it suits you. And you're Lovro? You must've guessed it. It says "company", but it's just you two. Where's everyone else? I've had enough. We will meet again. - Hello, tigers! You're still alive? - More and more by the day. Rumors are you fell under an express train. Phoney propaganda, comrade! You're right on time. The Commandant is waiting for you. Look out! The train's approaching the 3rd rail. Look at him. He's getting ready for his next job after the war. - All right, Matija? - You know that us miners have a guardian angel. - What mysticism, comrade Matija! - You almost make a battalion. - Yes, we're expanding. Where to? - To headquarters. Great, let's go together. How many times? Twenty-one. And you? - Airport, three aircraft. - Boy, are you lucky! Plan, Dane, plan! What plan? A plan of the airport. Change of guard, telephones... - Where did you get it? - The brigade. - How come they had it? - Secret service. Captain Brina got hold of it. Captain Brina? - Never heard of him. Is he new? What's he like? - I don't know. These informants are so well camouflaged, you can't find them with a candle in daylight. Hey, Commander! - We said, the kitchen first. - All right, let's have a bite, then. - The Commandant will buy you lunch anyway. - Yeah right, in a hotel. - Did you hear that? - What? They are swarming, but were given an informant anyway. They got a plan, not an informant. Same thing. Were we ever given a plan? - We know the track by heart. - Stop with the track already! We just got here and Commandant wants to see us. Don't you see? - I'm not psychic. - Mission, pal, a mission! - What mission? - A real, genuine mission. You'll see. Listen. Don't mess this up. The headquarters are no pub. We have to think before we speak. The things you say... It's best you keep your mouth shut. Stay quiet? Understood, Commander Sir! Evening, lads! Well done, 21 missions. You served them right. We'll send the report to division. But now, something different. You know, the offensive has begun. It will get hot. A lot of force. - I have an important job for you. - Mission? A dangerous mission and a long journey. Are you tired? - Can you depart ASAP? It's urgent. - We're as fresh as a daisy. Good. Depart today. You will take children with you. I beg your pardon? You will take children to liberated territory. - Children? - Yes, three children. - What, whose children? - What do you mean whose? Ours! Ours? I never had a kid. We rescued them from transport. Meaning, they're ours. We can't keep them here. The courier network is gone. - What is it? - But, Comrade Commandant... The two of us, we worked in the mines. But we're miners now, Commandant. Miners, not babysitters. Exactly, you're skilled soldiers. You can get through an ambush. That is why I picked you. Mission? How is that a mission? A mission fit for two warriors? - The whole division will mock us. - Now, listen-- I give you my word, we know nothing about children. He can't stand children at all. It's why he's not married! He might get used to them now. Who knows, he might even get married. You have to make your way to the river. You'll have to avoid the Germans even more now, when leading the kids. An extra day or two of travel is much better than a bullet. - I'm really sorry, but that won't work. - Why not? I can't resist shooting whenever I see a German. No, I can't. You know us, old soldiers. Damn you, halfwits, haggling with me. Wait. Here... this will help you to safety more than a machine gun. - It's all your fault. - Of course. Now it's my fault. You didn't say a word. Even when I mocked you, you sabotaged it all. The order was to stay quiet. I am a disciplined man, comrade. You said you'll do all the talking, make a stand. You saw it's all muddled because of the offensive. Me not getting married because of kids, that was something. Didn't you hear how hard I tried to change his mind? I heard alright. A friend, comrade and brother in arms. To disgrace your own company in front of the Commanding Officer. - Not you too. - I'll ask for a transfer. I'd rather be a cook than be with such a Commander. Will you put on a shirt, Peter? I'll put it on later. - Is it them I'm taking? - That's right. - But where? - Commander Dane will tell you. Dane... that miner? Have you ever thought about deserting? Not until today. Look at us. The Germans won't have to fix the track today. They have a day off. God knows if they're bored, too. As your political officer, I have to tell you that your morale is low. How's yours? - Isn't this ride lovely? - No, it's not. And why is that? Because it's shaking. Calm down, Peter, we'll be able to walk soon. I'm not going. You have to. We will all go. I won't have to. I'll be tired. Where are we driving to? - To the brigade's guard. - And then? Dane and Lovro will take you from there. - That man looks strict. - Which one? The short one, Dane. - Did you see Matija's Company? - Yes. But I really didn't want to. They must have given them a super important mission. - Darn it, how little they trust us. - But why? - We're skilled soldiers, good miners. - Could it be political? Use your head. You're the political officer, you find out. I'll ask around what's wrong with you. On our way back, I'll try to find that informant, Captain Brina. I'll have a little word with him. What are they waiting for? Go on, move! I beg you, move. Come on, girl. Come on, sweet darling, please. You filthy fascist monster! Giddy-up, horsie! Crazy beast! Whoa! Stop! - Blimey, she's gone wild! - Holy cow! Giddy-up, horsie! Giddy-up! Giddy-up, horsie! Giddy-up! Giddy-up! Giddy-up, go, go, go! Won't the horsie run anymore? - Have you become coachmen? - You must be forming a Pioneer unit. - I don't envy you. - Orders are orders. It'll be hard to break through. Brina said it's chaos down there. - Captain Brina? He's in the brigade? - He made contact two days ago. The Commandant is afraid they will find him out. I'll send him your best when I find him. - What's your mission? - We're going to bomb the hell out of the devil. Good luck! Goodbye! Let's go. - Put on some speed! - Giddy-up! Is that your rifle? Did you mean it when you said you wanted to be a miner? - Of course. - It's not that simple, comrade. Miners are special forces. The elite, so to speak. I know, miners need to be experienced. True, not everyone can be a miner. I was a sniper at first. You were a sniper? Yes. I made many a hit. Obviously, you need the right kind of weapon. With this one, for example, you can hit a target from a mile away, if you're a true anti-fascist. Is that why it's so long? Damn right it's long! How else should it look like? - A sniper has to hit, not just shoot. - I get it. They only gave me a small one. You know, they don't take us newbies very seriously. Bad human resources politics. But things are changing. If you truly believe that it'll help you become a partisan... Take it. - Do you mean that? - I meant what I said. I'll try to modify this one, if I can. Don't you get it? This is a special mission. Miner, intelligence and sabotage. Top secret, of course. - Won't the children get in the way? - They serve as camouflage. - Because of the fifth column. Capiche? - You're as sly as a fox! Tactics and strategy, comrade. Stop right there. - There we go! - Give me your hand. - They're not both for us, are they? - No, just the first one. - Drive safe. Send our regards to the brigade. - Yes. Goodbye! Good luck with the mission! - You snatched that right up. - This rifle is not for a recruit. - He gave me the rifle himself. - Yes, I saw that. - You'd make a good political officer. - Why's that? - You can spin quite a story. - From now on, there will be order. You take care of the little one. And you're responsible for both. You make sure they follow orders. Form a line! March! Halt! They're in the company now? Yes, what did you think? - Are you out of your mind? - What's wrong? - You're shooting as if you're at home. - At home? I was just trying it out. Soon you will have to. Move! We'll have to leave any minute now. Feed it. Can't you see it's hungry? You can't even lead a mule. - Goodness me! - Is it a pig in a poke? Idiot! Your sniper made a blunder. - What will we eat now? - We'll find something. Let's go! I'm not going. Why not? I'll get tired. Of course, he's so little. When I was his age... We won't travel far this way. When I was a boy, I had an afternoon nap every day. There's no other way, comrade. We'll have to carry him. Carry him? - There's no other way? - I don't think so. Well, you carry him, then. Why me? - Aren't you keeping guard today? - Keeping guard? Since when? You can remember your childhood, but not being on guard duty today. - I'll carry him tomorrow. - The orders might change tomorrow. You never know what's going to happen in the partisans. Now I won't get tired. Is he going to whistle all the time? You tell him. He might listen to a Commander. Peter, dear, won't you stop whistling? - A train whistles, too. - Yes, it does. Are you a train? No, you are. Break! Here, hold this! I don't think this is good for the child. - What now? - You carrying him. You're going to spoil him. He will never gather his bearings if he becomes a partisan. - He'll never be a partisan. - Who can tell? In school, I was taught that a war lasted 30 years once. Let me down. It's nothing, Peter. He is overreacting. What? I'm not overreacting. You need to be more mindful to preserve senior authority. Please! Our authority has long gone down the drain. Luckily, I had some provisions in store, after your sniper walked off with our rations. I'm sure we'll pass by a house soon. While Matija's Company are strolling down the valley, I'd love to know what they're scheming. What? - Just checking if you're green. - Green? - They say envy is green. - Just shut it! You want to know, too. Only a little. Listen, Dane. Is what we are doing a mission or not? The Commandant thinks so. I think it's a nursery, and not a mission. We'd be all right if it weren't for the little one. If there were a partisan deity, I would believe he was sent to us as a penance. Ljuba is a good girl. Look at the dinner she made us! Miran will make a good partisan. But he will make our blood boil. Does he mean to sleep till noon? Does he want breakfast in bed? Where's your trumpet? - Lovro! - What's up? - It's not working! - You blew too hard, and broke it. No, I didn't blow anything. Fix it! Mister Dane won't let me. - Why? - Because. Why because? Ask him. Dane! What are you two doing? Silence! I'm going on patrol. Let me down! Here, hold this! There we go. Mister Lovro, where is Dane? There was a courier outpost somewhere around here. Can't I be a courier in our company? Who will wipe your tears away when you're scared? Be quiet when we men are talking! You're too young to be a courier. But if Dane was right about that 30 years long war, then it could happen. So? No one in sight, and the hut is burnt down. It will be no picnic crossing that pass. - Where's that tyke? - Peter! Silence! Peter! Peter! Forward! What the hell? Who knew these hills would be so alive. I have a feeling that our nice stroll has come to an end. - That wasn't right, comrade. - What? Beating him up. - Now you're on his side! - I'm not taking sides. We're fostering new relationships between people. Surely we're not going to beat children after the liberation. - Are you being political again? - Your politics are problematic. No wonder they don't trust us. Now listen, comrade! I think you're right about several things. That there won't be money, there will be no banks or taxes, all that you political officers say. But that I won't be able to give a child a well deserved beating? I'm telling you, it's against the politics. There were so many faults, I'll have to hold a meeting. You do that! Just wait until we lose the Germans. Let's go! My shoes! - My trousers! - It's all in there. Is there any food? It's your sniper. - What are you doing here? - Looking for you. - Me? - Yes. Everything got mixed up, so they told me to find you and then go with you. - What? With me? - Yes. Whose dumb idea was that? The Commanding Officer's. Really? First the children, and now a recruit. Were you shot at? - Yes. - You started with a bang. You have to be on your best behaviour, now that you're taught in my company! If I can't make a soldier out of you, no one else can. Is that so, political officer? Now stop being foolish! Complete silence and strong discipline! - Understood? - Yes, sir! When you reach a clearing, be careful. Get it? Of course. Stay still until you see or hear something. Only if it's all clear can you go forward. Understood? Of course! - You see anything? - Yes. What? - The Germans. - Go to hell! The only thing you see are Germans. Good heavens, it's really them. Are you mad? Partisans use their heads to think, - and their legs to run away. - He only shoots if he has to. Retreat! Darn it, I wish I had my machine gun! - They've been gone a long time. - Do you even know what a patrol is? I know just as much as you do! Lovro, why is your company so small? Why? Girl, we're a special unit. We have four men now. - Do you want to be on the register? - Of course! Instead of a rifle, you will get a rocking horse. Ouch, you pea-brain! Quiet! - I'll tell the other man. - What will you tell him? How you threw me on the ground. Did you forget how that man whacked you? I want to go home... Who's at home now? Tani... He was so sad when I left. Did he cry? - Who? - What do you mean, who? Tani. He didn't cry. He whined and barked! Who was barking? Why, Tani! Don't you know that Tani's a doggie? He's a dog! Oh, boy! Germans! Look, Lovro! Cherries! Are they good? No more cherries? Can you hear that? Someone's playing the pipe! It's just birdsong. Can you teach me? You can do it, give it a go! Let them look for us up there. We'll be safe in the valley. - I told you, it's quiet on this side. - Ambush after ambush over there. - I felt like a hounded rabbit. - The Commandant won't be happy. We failed to find Captain Brina, and didn't even get close to the warehouse in the cave. - Should we go back to the brigade? - What else we can do? Luckily, Dane is leading the kids on this side where there's no Germans. Let's go! Did you see that? The Germans went up there, but it's so peaceful here. You need to have a knack for these things. Peter, come here! No, I want to climb in the rucksack. You have to walk beside me. Carry me! No, comrade. I won't pamper you like Lovro. - You will walk by yourself. - Fine, then. Hold out your hand. What's wrong? Come on, tell me! - Wee-wee! - What? - I have to pee! - Right now? Can't you hold it in a little? I can't. Ljuba-- No, Miran! You take me! - I'm thirsty too. - Where will I find water around here? Wherever. - I'll go. - Let him go, he's old enough. Fine. But come back quickly. Wait! What if you run into Germans? - Like, unexpectedly? - I'll scram. That's just like you. Why wouldn't you shoot? - Me against them? - What if they take you hostage? - I'll be taken, of course. - What would you think about? - Probably what they'd do to me. - I'd love to stick one on you! It's not your problem what they'd do to you! It isn't? I thought it was mine. No, you only have to think about how you're going to escape. Of course! That would be one of my worries. - That should be your only worry. Understood? - Yes, of course. - It will all make sense one day. - Don't worry. Break! Do you think that we're going to open a butcher's shop? - We'll milk it. - Milk what? Why, the cow, of course! Ox! Where? That cow! Darn it, you're right. Please don't bring back an elephant. He'd be great for a culture group. He makes a spectacle of himself. What are you laughing about? Where there is livestock, there are people too. You're a little genius. Let's have a look! They're at home, cooking. I knew it. Will we have something to eat? - Yes. - You don't know who's inside. I'll go have a look. They might need convincing. - Be quick, the kids are hungry! - I'll wave my handkerchief. At least we'll hear if you walk into an ambush. - Do you know who I am? - No. Can't you see I'm a partisan? I-I rarely go anywhere... You really don't have to. Partisans... visit on their own. Where is your husband? I'm a widow. - And the boys? - In the city. Are they for working for the Germans? That's a man's business, I don't really understand it all. How well... - do you understand a woman's business? - What? Cooking, for example? Make some polenta and milk. Fine, if that's an order. I'm not giving you orders. I'm just trying to convince you. - I'll get some water for the polenta. - Good, be quick about it. There's a spy in the house. Hands up! What are you waiting for? Who gave you permission to behave like that? There'll be no discussion here. Who are you allied to? - Answer me! - My gosh, - now I have to answer to every brat I meet. - You'll have to! Why are you here? You know what, we're not going to talk like this. What are you doing? Did he attack you, miss? - "Miss"? She's Gestapo! - Oh, my god! She's no Gestapo, she's a partisan! Dear me, who's who, now? They're partisans, too. They're taking our kids to the liberated territory. At least we know who we are now. - Well, you cooked up a storm. - It's not my fault. Your weird behaviour confused me. I thought he was sent by the Gestapo. Me, Gestapo?! These field agents are stark raving bonkers. What would you have done if you were me? - I'm Magda. - Lovro. This is Dane, our Commander. He's a great guy, but sometimes he can get quite worked up. What's happening? Won't I get something to eat? Of course you will. Follow me. What are you doing here? Are you a field agent? What's the situation around here? It's so critical that every sensible man ought to set up a guard. The Germans are everywhere. Hear that? We have a new Commander. She's right. I'll go have a look, just in case. - Are you planning to cross here? - Over here. With the children? As far as I know, they are my responsibility. But I know that you can't break through here even with a battalion. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. You're a woman, but I am a partisan. And they are just children! Why are you looking at me like that? Haven't you seen a partisan before? You're the most irritable one I've ever seen. - You say you know the area? - Somewhat. Have you heard of Captain Brina? I have, several times. See, I'd love to meet him. Matija's 1st Company are looking for him. He's probably on a mission. Have you heard anything? It's probably about that cave. What cave? The Germans are planning to attack the liberated territory. Where? The liberated area. Since they can't drive up to the river, they gather material and ammo in an underground cave. They don't want to be dependent on transport, you see? That's quite something. Where is this hole, anyway? If you're going to pass through here, you'll be quite close to it. The Germans have fortified the entrance. It's a real fortress. Where's Matija's Company, then? And Brina, the devil of a man? They couldn't break through. I'm not sure how you got here, either. You're coming with us, girl! - You don't say? - That's right. Why is that? - You're needed on the field. - Is that so? Didn't you say you're responsible for the children? I did. But that's my problem. - Not a word of this to the political officer. - What officer? Lovro, of course. Dear Commander and Comrade, I'm taking the fastest way to the liberated territory. I have to warn them about the cave. You two are on a different mission. It's an offensive, and I'm the Commander here. Is that clear? I'm in charge! Where would we be if a woman started to meddle in giving orders, especially during the offensive! Dane, why are mad at the lady? Here we go. Polenta, children! It's all for me! I will go find your comrade. Go eat, while it's still hot. I'll keep watch. I really am hungry. You're starting to grow on me. Give me the rifle. - Do you know how to shoot? - Don't you worry about that. Women are truly in charge in this house. Eat up, Peter! A partisan always cleans his plate. Miran, do you know what a real partisan says when he enters a house? "Madam, do you have any water? I'm hungry and need a place to rest." If mister Dane used those words before he entered the house, Magda would have taken him seriously and wouldn't have pounced on him. She wasn't even listening! She was far too scared. If it weren't for Lovro, I don't know what would've happened. Lovro always knows when to turn up. We have a deal. When I grow up, I want to be Lovro. I will never bathe at all. - I'll be a miner! - There we go, we might even form a battalion. - Germans are here! - Where? At the meadow. They're going up. It's a good thing we had our meal. - What about Dolfe? - We can't wait for him now. If he managed to find us once, he'll find us again. If he comes looking for us, hide him. - Put him in my bunker. - I'll do that. Good evening, chief! Partisan? Haven't you seen one before? I have, but during the offensive, this place is swarming with Germans. Then make haste. A loaf of bread, a piece of bacon, liter wine, and a liter of milk. Be quick about it, I'm in a hurry! This is all we have. Goodness me, is that how empty your larder is? What about bacon or sausages? Should I go find them myself? Germans! I've heard that one before. - Run! - Where? Please, come in. A liter of wine. And a bite to eat. Quickly! Where are the cups, boy? Fine, that's good. Cheers! One more liter! Good. You're a sweet lad. That's right. Partisans! Partisans! You're tired. You won't help me? He's a sweetheart, our Peter. Isn't he? Such a good boy. Magda! What is it? Is it true what you said about the cave? Of course. I believe you, I just had to double-check. Good. Have a good night. We have a long way to go. Don't you want to have a little nap before keeping guard? What a beautiful night. So many stars... Goodness, there's probably millions of them. Are you sure you don't want to sleep? It will do you good. I read this poem once, a real piece of art. It said that every man has their own star. The higher the rank, the more stars you have. You're always political, but when I try to be cultured, you poke fun at me. So that was cultured? As you're being all smart already, I'll tell you something. - I think I know already. - Balderdash! Then tell me. Matija's troops are looking for Brina to lay mines to an underground cave where the Germans are gathering ammunition and equipment. - Did Magda tell you this? - The company is nowhere in sight. And we are right next to the cave. What is it? Well, you know, the children! Could you turn a blind eye when passing a cave like that? - Never in my right mind. - Exactly. Why don't we come back to the cave as soon as we get the kids to safety? If it's still there. Gosh, what an opportunity, Lovro! What an opportunity. That's the thing. When it rains, it pours. With our luck... we'll be shifting ties till the end of our days. What a war. It takes all the fun out of it. Dane. We can't go there! - Why? - You know why. The cave is under that hill. The Germans are waiting in ambush. I know. Listen, Dane! Have I ever let you down? Think of the children. If I managed to bomb the cave, all havoc would break loose, - so we could make our way to the river. - It's true. But this is not a one-man job. Believe me. Damn it, they're following us. - Peter's not here. - What? - Peter! - Peter! - Peter! - Peter! Dane! Mister Dane! I fell down here. - Are you mad at me? - No, I'm not mad. Dane! They're on our tail. Everyone inside! This was a very good plan. Peter! The Commander commended you. Now be a good lad, or I'll give you a beating, - even though it's against my morals. - Lovro, light! This tunnel leads somewhere. Magda! Take care of the children. We'll be right back. Share a cig? Do you have any ideas? Let's say this tunnel leads to the German magazine. But... how will we lay mines? - Don't you have some explosives? - Yes, but I don't have any igniters. I have them. My god. Peter should be awarded a medal. Where did Dane and Lovro go? Did you fall down, too? Come on! - Is it alight? - By Jove, how I'd love to see that! You'll hear it. Let's go! General major! General major! General major! Don't get too excited! It's not over yet. - You think the boat is still here? - I hid it here myself. I doubt they found it. Here it is! Germans! They're coming this way! Push! Charge! Battalion ahead! Forward! Brigade, attack! Division, move forward! Charge! Are you planning to lead the headquarters into attack? - Retreat! - A partisan never retreats. - We must lure them away from here. - Oh, I see! Tactics! No sign of him. Bastards! You killed him! The best Commander, miner, comrade! The best friend! Please continue, I might shed a tear. Now you make fun of me! You had such a lovely speech. My god, Lovro, we got them! His boot got lost. Don't cry, Peter! - Goodness, this is worse than being hunted. - Oh, well. You'll have to get used to it. There's no order in place here. No discipline. You can't tell who's in charge here — everyone is! No, you see, they're laying the groundwork for freedom. What is it? Nothing, I thought I heard them. So they're well taken care of? Enough room to sleep? They all have their own bed. - What about food — is there enough? - More than enough. You know, wee Peter asked me if you bought new shoes. In a way, it's nice to have children. Do you know anyone from the partisans who got married? I mean, for example, a good old soldier. Will you invite me to your wedding? Me? Why? I was just asking. I was asking in general. As a Commander. Get it? - Yes, I understand. - 2nd Miners! Hello, boys! - Have a sip. - So these are the knuckleheads. Cheers! Cheers! - You plan to roam the liberated territory? - Sure. No, we're going back. But if it's at all possible, we'd love to be assigned a good informant. - An informant? - Yes. For instance, Captain Brina. So we wouldn't lay mines just here and there. - So we follow a plan. - We were just discussing you two. Captain Brina has a plan for you. A fiendish mission, boys. It's a big one! Captain Brina! Hello, boys! - Don't you know each other? - We do. Really well, in fact. But I think they like me more as Magda. This part here is heavily protected. Not a railway again? We need to obstruct German transport to the front lines. No one would do this better than you two. - You know what... - But Dane, there are two viaducts and ammunition wagons. Let's get a move on, so we can catch the first train. I'll never board a train again. That's how much these railways have turned my stomach. You wanted Captain Brina. Why are you complaining now? - I'm reporting for duty! - Where? I was assigned to your company. - Why did they assign you to me? - Because this is my area of expertise. Is it? I used to work on a railway. What did you do? I sold tickets on a train station. Didn't you say, Lovro, when it rains, it pours? Good! Wait! Here's your rifle. I don't want anyone thinking I stole it. Let's go! Company, forward, march! Darn it, I forgot to ask for her address. The Captain's? Goodness me, she's not going to be an officer forever.
