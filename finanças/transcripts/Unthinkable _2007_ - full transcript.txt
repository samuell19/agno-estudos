It's not even a discussion. You are dating the assistant district attorney. We have gone out a few times. We are definitely not dating. That depends on whether it's once or twice. The distinction is critical. If you've gone out once, then you have dated. If you're going out more than once then you definitely are dating. Hey, this is a robbery... You've been out of it for a while, but I'm actively on the scene... So I want to give you some free advice, okay? Cash, from the till, come on. Why stop at the A.D.A.? Shh, shh, shh! What? We got a problem. Get up. Against the wall. Stay there. Stay there. Hey... Hey! Uh-uh. Put the gun on the counter. Put your hands where I can see them. Up, up! And step back. He's going out the back door! Out of the way! Stop, stop! Hey! Freeze! Get down! Cross your ankles! Are you kidding me? Where were you going, were you going to fly off of here? You are in some serious, serious trouble, making me run up those stairs in these heels. Jamie... "Have dated," "are dating," big difference. Enough. Hello, Dan. Hi, Dan. Hello, Glenn. So, uh, I understand congratulations are in order. For what? This guy, Andrew germaine. Drug dealer, armed robber. You brought him in all by yourself. Well, actually, I did all the running, but Glenn did the handcuffing, because I still haven't worked out those things. I still have to practice a little bit. So... What do you think, celebration? Tonight? Mmm, can't tonight. Already have plans. Oh... All right. Well, we'll stick to the weekend. See you tomorrow, boys. Hey there, stranger. What are you doing here? Well, I thought I'd come down and find you since apparently you've chosen not to return my phone calls. Peter, look... I know that I didn't react the way you wanted me to, but you didn't react the way I wanted you to either. Well, thanks, mom. No one turns an apology into an accusation the way you do. I... I didn't mean it like that. Look, you don't decide where I live, who I live with, or what I do with my life, okay? You have no say. No, I-I don't decide, but I definitely have a say. I'm your mother, and that's what mothers do, or so I've heard. What do you want? I want US to stop fighting about all of this, and I you to come to dinner, tonight. It's a bad idea. Why is it a bad idea-- mom, Kelly is not-- yeah, no, I want Kelly to come too. I want you and Kelly to come. I can't stand this, Peter. You know, we haven't spoken since this started. Yeah, well, you and Susan started it, mom. No... I think you and Kelly started it. You guys said some pretty hurtful things. What, you think you didn't say hurtful things? Okay, you see what I mean? That's why it's a bad idea. You want me to beg? No. You want me to beg? No. I will go down there, and I will humiliate you in front of your friends, and don't think I'm above it, and you are not too old for that, pal. Okay. Wha-- what? Okay. And a smile to boot. Was that so hard? Okay, we'll come. We'll be there. I'm exhausted. 7:00. Sounds like a party. Okay, don't be late. Hey... So did you ask him? Somewhere between asking and pleading and begging, yeah. Are they coming? Well, so he says. Actually, his exact words were "sounds like a party." Hmm... Well, it's not like my daughter to miss a party. No, it's not. Not like me to go to one. I'm so not looking forward to this. Come on, it'll be fun. Is that a new coat? Yes, do you like it? Very nice. 7:00! I'll bring the wine. All right, go on. There's more bread, if anybody wants any. Well, congratulations. This is a new world record for avoiding the subject. We're not avoiding the subject. No, we're just dancing around it. Look, we know what we're doing. We're adults. You're 21, Kelly. Peter's only 19. Adults don't date for five days and then get engaged without any discussion. Why don't you try living together for a while? Well, we have known each other our whole lives. I don't think anyone is debating that that's a wonderful thing, but Kelly, sweetheart, you just came out of this long relationship with this guy-- mom... Shh. And... You just moved out of his house, you move into your mother's garage apartment. Now you're living with Peter, and now you're engaged? I just don't understand. Did you ever think that there was a possibility this could be a bit of a rebound relationship? We know what we want. Five days of dating and two weeks of living together is not enough time to make a judgment about what you want. What we want is to get married, okay? Yeah. Sooner the better. The sooner the better? What is the rush? Kelly, you're going too fast. You just broke up with ray. You were supposed to marry him, remember? They're going to revoke my licence and kick me out of high school. I'm not fit to be a guidance counselor. When were you two thinking of doing this? End of the month. That's 10 days from now! What kind of a wedding are you going to have in 10 days from now? Who are you inviting? I mean, do I even know them? I knew this would happen. Okay, Kelly, just sit down... No. Where are you going? To celebrate. That's if we're all done celebrating here. Kelly... I'll be outside, Peter. Great. Don't say I didn't try. Thanks for dinner. Okay. Well, that was fun. You should have said something. I did. I said that we've known each other our whole lives, and now we want to get married. Yeah, but you just sat there like it was nothing. Like you didn't really mean it. You should've stood up and gone crazy on them. Crazy? Kelly... This is nothing to get crazy over. Come on... They can't stop US. They're going to get used it, okay? All right? They can't stop US. Don't you ever lose it, Peter? Hmm? Just... let it go? Is that what you want? Mm-hm. Why is she doing this? To make you crazy. Well, it's working. She's not over ray. I think they're making a mistake. Perhaps we need to come at this a different way. I think chaining her in the closet until she's 30 is against the law. Good idea, but, yeah, I do think it's illegal. Isn't this just parenting 101? You tell them not to do something, they want to do it even more? Yeah. So? What are you saying? I'm saying maybe it's not the end of the world. I'm saying maybe we have to let them make their own mistakes. Do we have to? Yeah, you're right. I can't believe Peter was three when we moved in here. Yeah, and Kelly, she was what, she was five? Sure didn't plan on this, did we? Hell of a lot we didn't plan on. Right. I say we go to Renee's, have a glass of champagne, and we tell those two crazy kids of ours that if this is what they want to do... They should go ahead and do it. They should just do it. I say we go to Renee's, have the champagne, and secretly sign them up for the peace corps. Two years, different continents, kind of like an adult time-out. Oh, is that a jungian concept, is it? It's called "if all else fails" therapy. You're not really a child psychologist, are you? Not tonight. Come on, let's go. Hey, can we take your car? Yeah. You got lucky. He's supposed to be out of town. Well, he's not. He's looking at me. So don't look back at him. Who cares about him, kell? It doesn't matter anyway. The guy's an a-hole. You're not going to do anything? Kelly... He's over there, and we're over here. Just let it go. Please. All right. This is crap, kell. I don't have to be here. I can go. Why don't you finish your beer, you can dump your chump-- hey... And let's get out of here. What the hell do you-- you shut up, arsehole! Want to show me some I.D., bud? All right, kell, let's get out of here. Come on, let's go. Get lost, loser. Get back here. Hey, what the hell are you doing, man? Screw you, ray. Don't you get it? We're so over. I don't want to see you ever again. You're going to pay for that, you stupid witch. You'll see me real frigging soon. You did that on purpose. You set him up. You set me up, Kelly, and I don't work like that. That's because you don't love me. That is stupid, Kelly! Of course I love you. Just, why do always have to test me? Why can't you just believe me? Wait... What... Where are you going? To my mother's. Just stay in the apartment. I don't want to see you. I don't want to see anybody. Kelly, wait, just let me... Kelly... Kelly! Dammit! I have school tomorrow. Innocent students that need comfort and guidance. That's why I hate staying out so late. It's 1:00. Stop your whining. We'll be home in 10 minutes. I remember when you used to be fun. Hey... Give me the keys. I'm driving. What if you get pulled over? I'll show them my badge. You do have it with you, right? No. Oh, good plan. I wonder where he's going in such a hurry. Ow! Switchblade key. Lovely. Shamelessly flirting with him. I couldn't believe it. Oh, my god. My house, Jamie! Oh, my god, Susan! Where's Kelly? Kelly... She's staying at Peter's, right? I don't know. I don't know either. I live here. This is my house. Is my daughter in there? Is there anybody in the house? It's her house. I'm detective mcdowell. Did you check inside? They went in a few minutes ago. If anybody's in there, they'll find them. We've been here maybe five minutes. The place went up like the fourth of July. Is that Kelly? Kelly! Aw... Aw, Kelly... Kelly? Oh... Not my Kelly... My son was with her. You go. Tell somebody to go look for my son. Kelly... Tell someone! My son was with her! Kelly, no, no... Kelly... Kelly! Shh. She was the only one. Are you sure? Oh, my god... She's going to be okay. Kelly... She's going to be okay. Come on with me. She live here full time? Off and on since high school. How old was she? 21. She smoked in bed. Her mother was always on her about it. I see a dresser reduced to ashes. That's got to make me wonder. What dresser? Oh, jeez... Okay... Girl comes home, passes out, her cigarette sets the sheets on fire, that lights the bed on fire. So our bed is the heat source, right? That's what we call "a set." You know, what we should be seeing is a single "v," coming away going up the wall from this original set. Now, why do I see a "v" here and another one here? Multiple sets means multiple points of origin. No... This is not the cause of the original fire. What? Yeah... Presence of an accelerant. Hell, you can still smell it. It's a petroleum product. Gasoline, kerosene, diesel. The lab will tell US what it is for sure, but it's definitely petroleum. You keep gasoline in your bedroom, detective? No. Uh, so-so we have multiple sets and evidence of an accelerant? Someone poured gasoline on the walls, the furniture, the bed, and then just lit a match. Hey, tape this off, secure it as a crime scene. What we have here is arson. You all right? I'm actually more concerned about Peter. He's a mess. He was with her last night. We're going to need to ask him what happened before the fire, right? Yeah. No, I know, I know. He's at his house. He's not going anywhere. I found this cloth... Stuck on that fence, near the top of the driveway. It smells of gas. I'll be up there. I want you to print this whole area here. Bring in the team. Yes, sir. Why would anyone want to do that? I just don't get it. People intentionally set fires for a lot of reasons. Insurance claims, structural assault, juvenile delinquency. We change our investigative approach when the arson includes a homicide. Peter... There's going to have to be an autopsy. What if it was a mistake? What if it wasn't arson? There was no mistake. There was gasoline everywhere. Peter... Can you think of any reason why someone would want to kill Kelly? I... I should never have let her go home alone. I don't know what I was thinking. You can't blame yourself. Well, if there's going to be an investigation, I want you to lead it. I can't do that. You know I can't. Don't worry, we'll find out who did this. What happened to your hand there? I hurt it at work. You asked me who I thought would hurt Kelly. Try her ex-fiance. Ray rankin. He was at the bar last night. Kelly threw a beer in his face. He threatened her and then he took off out of the bar. Ray threatened her? Yeah. He... He said she'd pay, said... She'd see him real soon. Anybody else hear him say this? Only the whole bar. Kelly was... Really upset. She got into a cab, and she went to her mother's. We're so wasted. We don't even know what we're saying right now, okay? Let's just go home, come on. Let's just go home, Kelly. Where are you going? To my mother's. Just stay in the apartment. I don't want to see you. I don't want to see anybody. Kelly! You should let me drive. No. Or wait in the car? Nope. Uh... let me do the talking? Probably not. Ray rankin? What do you want? There was a fire at Kelly's last night. Did you know that? No, I didn't, bro. 'Cause we're not together anymore. It was a sex thing anyway. Oh... you're a champ, aren't you? Yeah, thanks, buddy. She's dead. Where the hell were you last night? I don't have to answer that. Yes, you do. You're the ex-fiance with the stellar record. Assault and battery, possession with an intent to sell, grand theft, huh? You threatened her. You stormed out of there, you waited for her, you followed her to her mother's house, you killed her, and then you burnt that place down. Why don't you get the hell off me? Jamie... Breaking and entering, arson, homicide. Three aggravating circumstances. That is the death penalty. Jamie! Screw you, mcdowell. Screw you, and Kelly, and both your families! I'm calling my lawyer. Third degree burns to 80% of her body. All the physical evidence of death due to severe exposure to fire, except... Except what? Except there's no smoke in her lungs. Asphyxiation occurred before the fire. It's not what killed her. The fractured hyoid bone, the depressed larynx seem to suggest strangulation, and she'd had intercourse either before or during the strangulation. I've got semen samples. We'll run them in the lab. It's hard to know for sure whether or not she was raped. There's a lot of burn damage in the area. I do see some evidence of forced entry, but, well... Maybe it was rough sex that got out of hand. There's a very high level of alcohol in her bloodstream. If the killer was drinking as much as she was, I can see it all going south in a hurry. So you're saying it's a... Possible rape and strangulation? Something like that, yes. Right, uh... I'm going to let the guys know, okay? I'll be right back. Any idea who did this, detective? Yeah, we have a suspect. Yeah. Thank you, Miriam. You're welcome. He raped her? That son of a bitch. I know. Well, you got to get him. Yeah, we will. Does Susan know? Glenn's with her now. He's telling her. Listen, Peter, I know how difficult this is for you, and I hate having to do this, but I need you to go through that night again and tell me everything you remember, because we're trying to re-construct the time-line, and what we know is that ray has no alibi after he left that bar. Yeah, that's because he followed her home to her apartment and killed her. And that's exactly what we're thinking, but if you can, let's go through it again. Okay. After we left your house, we went to Chelsea's and the avalon first. Then we went to the copper penny to play some pool, and I guess it was, like, 10:30. Was ray already there? No. No, Kelly said he had the night off, but he showed up for a shift anyway. We had a couple words, but it was really nothing. How long before the trouble began? Mmm... 45 minutes, maybe. 45 minutes... So that would put it 11:15. Ray leaves, he's completely hammered. What time did Kelly leave? Maybe 20 minutes later. I mean... She was drunk and pretty pissed off. At you? She was taking it out on me, but... Well... She was drunk. I don't even think she knew what she was saying. Yeah, the cabbie said it took 25 minutes to get from the copper penny to Susan's house because Kelly was so drunk, she couldn't give even him proper directions. Anyway... That puts her inside at 10 after midnight, and we checked her phone records. It looks like she called you as soon as she got home. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah, but I wasn't home yet. I thought she'd blow off some steam and come back. I left at midnight and went home, just hoping she'd changed her mind and went to my place. It's me. I'm sorry, Peter, but this isn't working. I'm going to stay at my mom's for a few days. Just leave me alone for a while, okay? So Kelly gets home at 12:10, calls Peter 12:15 and leaves a message. That checks out, right. Yeah, and then sometime after 12:15, rankin breaks in, rapes and murders her. Kelly expires... 12:40, 12:45? Give him 10 minutes to figure out what to do, goes to his vehicle, gets his gas can, douses the place, sets the fire. That's about 12:50, 12:55. Right, then he bolts out the door, leaves a piece of clothing behind... And you get home at 1:00 am, fire department's already on the scene. It works. Yeah, it does. Only thing is, we don't have any witnesses. That we know of. You're thinking reward? Well, I'm thinking somebody had to have seen him, and now we just have to give them a reason to come forward. True enough. Okay, so you talk to the captain about the reward, and we'll... We'll canvass the neighborhood one more time. Also, how you doing? You okay? Look, um, Glenn? I'm going to get out of here. I'm going to call you back, all right? Okay, well, stay in touch, all right? All right. What? You got a minute? No. It's funny, I distinctly heard myself say, "no." Yeah, that happens to me all the time. It's called parenthood. I want US to offer a reward on the Shaw murder. It's not your case, Jamie. I want US to offer 10 grand. Mcdowell, that's more than three times department standard. We can't afford it. But I know who did it. I just need a witness to come forward. You're too close to this case, Jamie. Yeah, that's right, I am, Paul. It's my best friend's daughter. I've known her since she was three years old. Now, I want US to offer 10 grand, and I'm not leaving this office until you say yes. Okay. Okay? 10 grand. Thank you. Hey, mcdowell... You've done what you can. Let US do the rest, all right? Thanks for coming down. Can I get you some soda, coffee? Water? Are you sure? Did you get him? No, not yet, but-- but we have offered a reward, for 10,000. It's a hell of a lot more than I thought my captain would go for, but he did. Has anyone come forward? Yeah, a few people, but nothing we can use yet. But the good news is, is that now ray knows it's just a matter of time. He will make a mistake, he will slip up, I promise you. Just... I just, I wish you were leading this investigation. You know I can't. But between you and me, I'm very much a part of this investigation. I'm just working through Glenn. Yeah? Come on, let's get outside. Let's get some fresh air. This is much harder than when Steve died. You lose your husband... You're heartbroken, but you have a child, so you soldier on and find a way to keep living. Remarry, whatever. Did you feel like that when Mike died? Yeah. I think so. It was a long time ago. One day we're double-dating, the next, we're single moms with little kids. Yeah, I know. But when your child dies... Especially like this, you're not just heartbroken... You're dead. You die with them... And there's no soldiering on. There's just nothing. There's nothing. Susan, I'm so sorry. Sweetheart, I'm so sorry. Well, here we are. It was a great meal. It certainly was, and thank you very much. You're very welcome. I think a nightcap is in order. Absolutely, yeah. Dan... Sorry. That's okay. No, that's okay. I'd still like a nightcap, though. Absolutely. Okay. White wine, is that good? Perfect. I have some open in the fridge. It's a nice place you got here. Oh, thanks. Oh, my god... Oh, my god... My... my cat... My cat, my cat... Oh, my god. Come on, let's get out of here. Why? Fat lady's in the house. She's not singing yet, but she's warming up. We got a reward. People are coming forward. It's just a matter of time. One of the neighbors down the street walking her dog, saw some punk in a red hoody jump into a pick-up and take off just before the garage went up in flames. A red hoody with white print on the front. Blue jeans, work boots. Huh? It wasn't me, bro. We got a piece of the sweatshirt. We got a warrant, too. We're going through your place right now. We're going to find it. We're going to find that sweatshirt. My client came down here as a show of good will. It's called cooperation. If you're going to make accusations without charging him, we're done here. You threatened her in front of everyone. You told her you'd see her real soon. You waited for her in the parking lot, and you followed her. We got witnesses for all of that, and guess what? You got no alibi! No one knows where the hell you went after Kelly made you look like a chump in front of all your moron buddies. Mr. Rankin went for a drive to cool off, just as he said. There you go. You killed my cat. Oh, yeah, someone killed your cat? That's sweet, because I hate cats. Oh, no... You murdered Kelly, and you feel nothing! You feel no remorse, no regret! You feel nothing-- Jamie, easy! Enough, mcdowell! How dare you! You want remorse? Screw that. I'm glad the witch died! All I have to do is put you in that room! Shut up! Mcdowell! I will put you in that room! My office, now! Okay... That was way past unprofessional. It was reckless. It was illegal! You're looking at being suspended without pay! I know, I'm sorry. You're sorry? What the hell were you thinking, detective? He murdered her! And you want him to walk because you screwed with his rights? You beat him up during an interrogation, in front of witnesses, in front of his lawyer! He's not going to walk? You're losing it, detective. Look... Just sit down. Jamie, I know how you feel. When my partner got killed, they dragged his greasy scumbag murderer in here so I could question him. It was everything I could do not to strangle him with my bare hands... But you have to be a professional. So you know, ray rankin is suing US. Assault, harassment. I'm sure he'll say his rights were compromised if we bring charges. We'll see. Now, stay away from this damn case. 6958... 6958, all right, you've been very helpful. I appreciate it. Jogger at the reservoir sees a bag of clothes washed up in the bushes. Knows we're looking for a red sweatshirt and blue jeans. Calls it in. Red sweatshirt, blue jeans, smells of gasoline. I got to take up jogging. Huh? I would rather be lucky than good. Yeah, this is detective dasher. Yeah... Yeah, I need a back-up unit to assist in a pick-up. All right. Yeah, 10 minutes down there. I'll meet you downstairs. Yeah... Jamie, we're going to go pick him up. Jamie, where are you going? Jamie, what... We got him, what are you... Where are you going? Just a sec. You want something to drink? No, thanks. I'm going to have a beer. You sure you don't want anything? No, you go ahead. So, what's up? I need you to tell me again about the night Kelly died. I told you what happened. I need you to tell me again. Okay... Um... We went to the copper penny, and ray was there, and then when we-- after that. Kelly... Kelly threw a beer in Ray's face, and-- after that. After she left, and you were there drinking alone. I came home, and then I... Punched the wall, and I passed out. You tell me the truth. I told... I told you the truth. I listened to Kelly's message, I punched the wall, and, uh... And then I went to bed. No, you didn't. Yes, I did. 'Cause... 'Cause my hand... You tell me the truth. My hand was... Killing me, and the room... The room was spinning, and then I passed out. I passed out. We found the red sweatshirt. I don't... It's not... mine. Yes, it is. There's a lot of people that have this... This sweatshirt. It has "pm" written on the tag. Peter mcdowell. I put it there. We found a gas can in the garbage behind the construction site at Peter's work. It's at the lab with his clothes. And we have semen from the victim. Kelly. Her name is Kelly. Kelly, sorry. We need Peter's DNA. Well, I think he's sat in there long enough. Why don't you go in there and see what you can get out of him? I want to talk to him first. Jamie... Paul, he's my son. All right, go ahead. It was a mistake to bring me here. I didn't do it. Then tell them that. You tell them that. You brought me here. You're my mother. If you're going to tell them, they're going to believe you. Gasoline is like a fingerprint, and they found gas on your clothes, at your job... And at Kelly's house, and if it comes back a match, it is a clear chain of evidence. I-I told you already. I came home, and I went to bed, and there's the timeline. You got Kelly's message at 12:15. I takes you 15 minutes to get to her house. That puts it at 12:30. It wasn't me. I loved Kelly. Why can't you just believe me? I know you loved her. I want to believe that you went home and went to bed, but that is not how it's lining up, because you're not telling me the truth. She's interrogating him. Yeah, and he's opening up. Just sit tight. How are any of US supposed to believe that you didn't mean to do it, if you don't admit to doing it in the first place? Peter, what happened? What happened? Are you a detective... Or are you my mother? You heard the message... I need your help. Peter, tell me what happened. I can't do it. You went home... Mom, please... You heard the message... Please... Tell me what happened. Why are you doing this to me? You went home. You heard the message... Mom, please. Please, please, please... You went home, you heard the message... I loved Kelly. I loved her with all my heart. You went home... You heard the message... I got in the truck. I got in the truck. I got in the truck because I had to see her. Kelly? Kelly... Kelly, it's Peter. Let me in. I don't want to see you anymore, okay? Kelly... I just... I just want to talk to you, that's all. Just let me in. Let me in your place. You know what? Ray was right about you. You're a mama's boy, Peter. You always will be. Kelly... You don't mean that. Look, so I didn't punch out some loser at the bar for you. Kelly, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you. You have to believe me, Kelly. We can fix this, please-- no, okay? We're over. No, I just want to talk to you, Kelly. No! Look what you did to my hand. No. I just want to talk to you, Kelly. No, Peter. No! Come on, please, Kelly. Just hear me out, Kelly. Oh! Ah! Ow, you're hurting me! Please! Stop... No! Peter, don't! Please! Kelly... Stop it! No... Kelly? Kelly. Kelly... Kelly! Kelly, Kelly, Kelly... Kelly, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, god. I'm sorry. Kelly. Please. Kelly, Kelly... Kelly, no... Oh, my god. Oh, my god... Kelly, Kelly... Okay, okay, okay, okay. Oh, god! What am I going to do? Okay... Will you prosecute him? Uh... People know I've been seeing you. I recused myself. The d.A. Is deferring to the Attorney General. I don't like the a.G. He's going for the death penalty. He can't do that. Well... There are three aggravated circumstances. And several mitigating ones. Unfortunately, he can't ignore, uh... Arson, rape... Murder. But he doesn't have a criminal record. Well, he's being booked. They're arraigning him later today. Attorney General's asking no bail. Violent nature of the crime... So, who's defending him? Jamie... Do you have someone to defend Peter? Um... I don't know yet. I-I don't... You know what, I'll give you a list of names, all right? Okay. Look, Jamie, would you like to take some time off? What? I mean, it's your call. Um, maybe, I don't know. I-I don't... I don't know. So, what's going on? Was there an arrest? Yeah. Did you get him? Did you get ray? It wasn't him. Then who was it? Jamie? Who did it? It was Peter. What? My Peter killed Kelly. That... That's not true. It can't be true. Susan... Susan, he confessed. Oh, my... Oh, my god. Oh, my... He... He raped her? He strangled her, is that's what you're saying? Oh, god... They got into a fight at the bar. She wanted to break it off with him. She was breaking it off? He was angry, and he was very drunk. He wanted to talk to her. He just wanted to talk to her. He just wanted to talk to her. It's so hard to understand. No, it's not. She was breaking it off, so he... He killed her. He raped her, he murdered her, and he... Lit her on fire to cover it up. He was drunk. They were both very, very drunk. You're saying it's okay to kill my baby because they were drunk? Are you trying to justify it? No! No... You think it's excusable because they were both drunk? That's not what I'm saying. Kelly is dead! Kelly is dead, and Peter killed her! That's inexcusable. That's unforgivable! Oh, god... Get out of my house. Get out. Get out of my house! Oh, god... No... No... I came home, and then I... Punched the wall, and I passed out. My hand was... Killing me, and... The room... The room was spinning, and then I passed out. There are three aggravating circumstances. He's going for the death penalty. Are you a detective or are you my mother? Because you need to help me. Help me. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? I need to talk to you too. I hired an attorney. Oh, that's good. Who? Ed Callaghan. What? Ed Callaghan. No, I heard you the first time. What I meant to say was what the hell did you do that for? Because the ag's going for the death penalty. Ed Callaghan defends cop killers. He likes defending cop killers. You can't hire him. Every cop on the force, including me, will take offense. Well, let me ask you this. What if were your son? He's a dirtbag. It's a bad move. Yeah, you're right, he is a dirtbag, and he also costs a fortune. So you're making my case? No, I'm claiming that reward money. You expect me to hand over 10 grand for bringing in your own son, so you can turn around and hand it over to ed Callaghan? That's not going to happen. I'm not asking you. Police money is not going, it will never go to ed Callaghan. It's not police money. It's my money. We both know that the only way this case is clean is if I bring him in as a mother. There is no way I'm letting you do this. You want me to say it? I'll sue you for it, Paul. Child molesters, drug dealers, and cop killers, that's who you want to be in bed with, huh? Why are you acting like I have a choice? Ray rankin is suing everyone in the whole damn county! Well, that's no surprise, is it? No, but it doesn't make it any easier to swallow, does it? He's asking for a ton of damages. The papers are going to run with this for weeks. It's bad press, mcdowell. It's bad for you, it's bad for the department, and it's bad for me. That's not what I wanted, and you know it. I know, and I'm sorry, but you leave me with no choice. I have to suspend you. Leave your weapon. I want that money. Jamie! Jamie, what's up? Huh? I'm suspended. What? And I hired ed Callaghan to represent Peter, and I want you to tell you myself before anybody else tells you, all right? I told you. Yeah, I understand. Look, you're going to lose a lot of friends. You know that, right? Then they weren't friends to begin with. All I'm saying is that maybe you ought to sleep on it a night before you go ahead and do that. You want me to sleep on it? You want me to sleep on it? I don't sleep anymore. I don't sleep anymore. There's no sleep for me. None. I didn't know you smoked. Yeah, I don't. Jamie! I'm fine. God... Darn it. So the foundation's still good, but as far as the house goes, going to knock it down, start from scratch. Uh, we can possibly start this week, but for sure next week. Prices-- hang on a second. Certainly. I read about you in the paper. Do you think the world feels sorry for you now that you've been suspended? What do you want me to say? I don't want you to say anything. I want you to listen and think. Think about all the lives Peter ended. Not just Kelly's, but mine, my family's, all of my friends, all of Kelly's friends. We will never be the same. You think I will? I think you've lost your mind! How dare you claim that reward money to defend Peter? Susan, you'd do the same. Peter killed Kelly! He deserves to pay for that with his life. You need to feel what I feel. That's justice! Look, if this is going to be a problem for you, detective mcdowell, you can always get yourself another attorney. I'm here for my son. I highly doubt we're going to be friends. All right? Oh, I imagine we won't be. Now, I already spoke to the Attorney General's office, told them I'd be representing Peter. I'm sure they were thrilled. Not really. We're meeting with judge waller this afternoon. What do you mean, this afternoon? Well... The child of a birch hills police detective violently rapes, murders, and burns a local young woman. Now, that's what you call a very public, very high profile death penalty case. Top priority for the a.G. Oh, he thinks he's going to win this one big. In fact, he's sure of it. And what do you think? I think all the evidence is against US, and there's a confession. I think we're going to lose. Well, guess what, I'm not paying you to lose. Well, regardless, we're going to lose. We expect to lose. We're not even trying to win. Well, then, what are... I don't... What are we doing here? What are we doing? What are we doing here-- we are trying to avoid the death penalty. Okay? Peter's going to jail for the rest of his life is what we're shooting for, because what's the alternative? The alternative is they strap him to a gurney, they inject him with sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride, and his life ends right before your eyes. Am I wrong, detective? Is that not what we're trying to do here? Save a murderer's life? My god. You're crueler than I thought. That's why people come to me. People just like your son. Do we understand each other? Yeah. I'm ed Callaghan. Your mother hired me to defend you. We are going to save your life. Did you kill your mother's cat? Yes. Why? Because I wanted her to think that rankin was trying to scare her off. You knew she'd go after him even harder. Yeah, something like that. So, uh... We'll say that it was simply a continuation of your moral confusion, that it wasn't an act of deception, but rather part and parcel of this crime of passion. Okay, that's... So we got that one. So let's go back now. Um, Kelly Shaw left you at the bar, got in a cab, and you did what? I went back into the bar. Stop. Every sentence that you utter on that stand must begin with a disclaimer. At no point are you to appear certain of yourself or of your story. But I know what happened-- no, no, no, the facts are all very sketchy to you now. They're fading into the background like some old photograph you can hardly see. Yeah, well, I can see that old photograph because it keeps playing in my head, over and over and over, and it doesn't stop. You make it stop. Tell me again. Kelly left you at the bar, and what happened after that? I don't remember. Good boy. I think... I went back into the bar and had a... A couple of beers, I don't know, maybe some shooters. And then what? I can't be sure anymore. Very nice, very nice. I think I went home and listened to Kelly's message. I don't know, this is really confusing me. Oh, of course it is, of course it is, and after that, you did what? I drove to Kelly's-- no. That's what I did. No, it doesn't matter what you did or didn't do. All that matters now is that the jury finds a mitigating circumstance-- but I deserve death. Just stop being so stupid and just do what he tells you to do. Now, we have to cast doubt on the confession. We have to cast doubt on Kelly. What? Yeah, her character's in question. No, it's not. Oh, yes, she used you. She used you as emotional leverage against Mr. Rankin, with whom she'd recently broken off her engagement. Stop it. She lied to you--that is enough. She used you, and she ultimately brought you to this point of blind rage. Enough. She's as much to blame for this as you are. No one deserves what I did to Kelly. Likewise, the jury has to be made to believe that you are as much a victim as she is. I killed her! She was asking for it! That's the picture we're going to present to the court. Your innocence was no match for her emotional prevarications. Okay, that's it, you get out. Your, uh, misguided, blind love for her-- get him out of here. ...led to this spontaneous act of passionate violence-- what the hell is going on? ...resulting in the unfortunate death of Kelly Shaw. She brought it on herself-- it was manslaughter, not murder. Get the hell out of here! Don't you get it? I'm finished. It's over. I don't want to live. So you can save your time, okay? And even if I did want to live, you think I would want to go in there, to that litter box with all those animals? You tell them. I want death. Dr. Post, you are the king county medical examiner? That's correct. You examined Kelly Shaw's body the morning after the murder? Yes, I did. Do your findings coincide with the defendant's confession? Yes, they do. Miss Shaw was strangled to death during forced sexual intercourse, and her body was then burned using gasoline as a fuel source for the fire. I see. Were there semen samples, or fingerprints, or any other crime scene evidence that could lead to DNA confirmation of the defendant's confession? Yes. There were semen samples, and fingerprints on miss Shaw's neck and body, and the defendant's clothing was found both near the reservoir and at the crime scene. Can you tell the jury your findings after testing the evidence? All the tested evidence was a direct DNA match for Mr. Mcdowell. The semen, the fingerprints, and the clothing all belong to the defendant. So it's reasonable to conclude that as his confession states, Mr. Mcdowell raped, murdered, and burned miss Shaw? I just want to talk to you, Kelly. No. Stop it. Ah! No, Peter! Police look for unimpeachable evidence, evidence that links the accused to the crime without question. Sometimes we get luckier than others. What about this time? Even without Mr. mcdowell's confession, the evidence is irrefutable. Nothing further. Is that the case? Just off the top of your head, detective, do you happen to know what percentage of death penalty cases have been overturned since 1977? No, I do not. Well, according to a recent study out of Columbia law school, 68% of convictions in capital crimes are overturned. 68%. Often as a result of flawed DNA evidence. Now, isn't it possible that in this particular case, the evidence is flawed? In this particular case, the defendant confessed to the crime. The evidence, the DNA results, are bearing with that confession, not at odds with it. But of course, that presupposes that the confession was obtained under incontrovertible conditions. Now, would you like to tell this court how this particular confession was obtained? Kelly, Kelly... Ms. Mcdowell, are you able to answer the question? Ms. Mcdowell... Are you telling US that Peter couldn't have committed the crimes of which he's accused? No. He did a terrible thing. He made the worst choice I could think of... But there have been 19 years of good choices. 19 years of no mistakes, no wrong choices-- objection. Your honor, she's making a speech. Ms. Mcdowell, just try to answer the question. He's a good son... And he's always been a good son. It's just that something... Something just went horribly wrong. For one moment, one moment, something-- your honor... Please. All right, Mr. Callaghan, let's have another question, please. Final question, your honor. Final question. Is Peter remorseful? Yes. He knows what he did... And he expects to be punished for it. He expects to be punished... Because he loved her. It's because he loved her. Susan, I hope that somewhere you still understand that. He knows what he did was wrong. He knows it. He expects to be punished. You can punish him. Please don't kill him. How much longer? There's no way to know. Two hours, two days. His guilt isn't in question, of course, just his punishment. You have to be prepared for the worst result. Is that what you think is going to happen? I never know what's going to happen. Juries are unpredictable. Sometimes they just can't look past the facts under any circumstances, completely devoid of emotion. But your feeling is it doesn't look too good. My feelings are immaterial, detective, but... No, they're not good. Fit to stand trial, fit for execution, right? We can appeal, of course. For how long? Years. Is that going to save his life? Well, I can't guarantee that it will. Sometimes the appeal process runs out and execution occurs, sometimes it doesn't. But either way, you stand to make a fortune, and my kid still lives his life out on death row. Not exactly the way I'd put it, but, yes, I am paid well for my services, and your son lives his life on death row. And is that an acceptable outcome for you? It's an outcome I've learned to live with. Are you married? Never. Got kids? None that I know of. Well, that's why you can live with it. Jamie... The jury sent word. Five minutes. See you inside. I suppose Callaghan told you. What, to expect the worst? To expect the death penalty? Yeah, he told me. It's... It's not a given. It doesn't look good. No, not too good. I don't even know if I still have my job... And I just realized I'm probably going to have to sell my house in order to pay for Peter's appeals. How is this happening? How is this happening? I'm here for you. Thank you, Dan. You're such a good guy. We should go. I don't want to go in. Okay, okay... Okay... Okay. All rise. Please be seated. All right, madam foreman, in the matter of the state of Washington vs. Peter mcdowell, has the jury reached a unanimous verdict? We have, your honor. Will the defendant please stand? Bailiff... Thank you. And how do you find the defendant? Guilty on all charges. And has the jury decided upon a unanimous sentence? We have, your honor. And what is the sentence, madam foreman? Life without parole. It's what we wanted. Order... We must have order in the courtroom. What? Hey, you got a minute? No. You know, it's funny. I thought I heard myself say, "no." How you doing, Jamie? I'm all right. That's good... And how's Peter? He's hanging in there. I'm proud of him. You know... It's hard adjusting, but he's in therapy, and, uh... And so the world moves forward. Well, what can I say? Ray rankin dropped the lawsuit. Is that right? Yeah, Glenn arrested him on drug charges. Possession with intent to sell. Selling drugs right out of his old man's house. Hmm... Anyway, we made a deal, less jail time if he drops the suit. Glenn's case from start to finish. Well, good for Glenn. You ready to come back to work? No... No, I'm definitely not ready yet. I really just wanted to come by and just thank you for everything that you've done. Door's always open. That's really good to know. Anyway, I got to scoot. I just wanted to... Yeah, I, uh... Well, you know. I'll see you. How are you? Up and down. It's not easy to find your footing when your whole world changes. No. I'm trained to help people through hard emotional transitions. Now I need someone to help me. That used to be me. It can't be me anymore, can it? No, Jamie. It can't. I see... I see you got a new cat. Named her Abby. That's nice. I know you like cats. And I know you don't. I'm allergic. I know. I remember. You're moving. Yeah, I can't stay here. Well, maybe when you get where you're going... You'll call me. When I get where I'm going, I'll call.
