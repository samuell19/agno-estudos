Wow, you came this close to bringing me the entire Spain! - So what do you say, guys? - Thank you! I left the presents for Elena and Cristina in the other room. Listen, Sandu, how can I reach Cristina? I'd really like to see her Maybe Toni knows some friend of hers who knows where she is... I'll ask him. If you hear from her, give her my phone number, OK? Please. I will, but I don't think she'll call You know how teens are... Alright. I'm going to see Elena at the hospital now. Afterwards I'll pay Dad a short visit too. Here's the thing: Do you think you can persuade the old man to sell? The doctors' fees are killing me! I don't know how to get by anymore. Sometimes I think I would be better off taking her to a... um... home... - God forbid! Take her to a home?! - What else can I do? You tell me! Isn't your mom beautiful? Come sit next to her. You know, if you talk to Mommy, she's gonna get well. - Daddy says she's gonna die. - Really? Dad says if Mom dies, he's gonna marry Miss Flori. - Who's Miss Flori? - Some ugly woman. Listen, can you also tell me what Daddy says about Cristina? - About Cristina? - Yes. "Cristina, that filthy cow." "Cristina, that goddamn tramp." That's all I remember... - And what does Cristina say? - Cristina got pissed off and left. - Where did she go? - I dunno. She didn't come back. - When? - A while ago. Good afternoon, where can I find Mr. Groza? - Check inside. - Thanks. - Good afternoon. Mr. Groza? - 'Afternoon. The office straight ahe - Hello, Sandu. - Hey. You know, I feel so exhausted. Why didn't you tell me about Cristina? Well... Excuse me, I have to get that Hello? No, I don't want no tires. You're all over me now! Yes, some nitrogen and some oxygen tubes. That's all! - What can I say? She kindda left... - Why didn't you tell me last night? I didn't want to upset you. Would you like to get something to... No, I don't want anything! So what happened? She found herself a hard dick, that's what happened! Hey, Gelu, stop using so much shampoo! Use more water! What the hell? How many times do I have to tell you?! Why didn't you let me know? What for? What could you have done from there? Have her tied up? There comes a time when people go crazy and start acting weird. That's what you've done too, isn't it So don't come to me and act like you're some big shot! I'm the one who took care of her for I got her off your back. - You got her?! - When you came to me whining... You were afraid to go to your father knocked up and with no husband, remember? You know what Father's like. What was I supposed to do? Raise her on your own, that's what! Where do I leave you, Ma'am? - At the University. - Fine, at the University. - You haven't changed a bit. - Neither have you. - Sit down, please. Coffee? - No, thanks. - When did you arrive? - Last night. Elena's had a stroke. I'm sorry to hear that. How about you How's everything going? Fine. Felix, do you know anything about Cristina? No, why? Is something wrong? Cristina's run away from home. I don't know what happened. I was kind of hoping you know something... But you shouldn't panic, she'll get by... - Thanks. - Kids like her always do. What is that supposed to mean? I've got plenty of cases like hers here: The psychosocial consequences of parent abandonment. I'm the author. What cases are you talking about? Children abandoned involuntarily: Their mothers left to work abroad Children abandoned involuntarily: Their mothers left to work abroad and their fathers can't take care of them, so they leave this job to other families. Such children feel underprivileged in front of the legitimate offspring of their adoptive family. It's really interesting, you know. I'll write a book about her. Do you actually realize it's our child you're talking about, Felix?! Hello, Toni. Silvia, you say? Silvia what? OK... and where's that? Have you talked to her? Alright, it's OK. Thanks. Oh, I checked in at the Opera Hotel. Silvia? I'm Cristina's mother. We've talked earlier on the phone. Oh, cool! I'm Silvia. Nice to meet you. Er... Can I ask you a few questions about Cristina? - Got a cigarette? - Yes. Thanks. I'm out of cash. Somebody was supposed to bring me some, but... Do you know where I can find Cristina? Does my face show? Come on, focus, please. Tell me where to find her. I'll take that! - You tell me if my face shows! - No, why? That's good. As long as my face doesn't show, it's all good... Don't know where you can find her. But it must be in Bucharest... Where in Bucharest? When was the last time you spoke with her? I'm not sure, New Years' Eve I think... Where was she then? Was she OK? She was just fine. Both of them were - she and her boyfriend... - What's the name of this guy? - Glont. - Glont who? - I don't know. Just Glont. Do you know where I can find this Glont guy? - "Twice". - What's that? You know what? How 'bout I give you Dita's number... - Who? - Dita. He's working with Glont. They've been friends since high school. I'll give you his number, but you have to call him after 10 o'clock. - OK. - Tell him you got it from... Lizuca. Like the name of that character in "The Magic Woods", get it? Mr. Dita? We've talked on the phone earlier. I got your number from Silvia or Lizuca or whatever... I'm actually looking for Glont. Or, more specifically, for Cristina. I'm her mother. - Good evening. - Yeah, so? So... Lizuca told me you know Cristina's boyfriend, Glont. She said you went to the same school together. That's right. - And that you're friends with him. - True. Do you know how I can find him? A phone number, an address, anything... Yeah... Wait here. - Are you Cris' mother? - Yes. - Cool! I'm Dorothy. - Luiza. - As in... - "The Wizard of Oz", I know. Nice to meet you. It's milkshake. Excuse me... He doesn't answer the phone. I really have to find him. Can you try to phone him again? Maybe he answers. Silvia said something about "Twice"... Yeah, man. We're in "Twice". Wait, I'll come downstairs right now. See ya! It was Dacos... I'll be right back. Here. - That lipstick's hot! - You like it? Here, you take it. - It's too red for my taste. - You serious? Sure. And it's not like I paid for it it was a gift. It looks good on you. It's too cool to say no. Thanks. What? Don't you remember me at all? No, I don't. I'm your mother... No shit! You're kidding, right? No. Then what the fuck are you doing in Romania? I thought you were away. I came back. Man, it's like a bad movie... So you were like following me?! - Yes, I've been looking for you. - What for? I wanted to see you. I wanted to talk to you. What about?! You wanna give me money so you can make it up to me?! I mean, you can give me money if you want to... If you wanna prove how much you love me. How much? How much... 3,000 euros. OK, I can give it to you tomorrow. But promise me we're gonna talk for at least one hour. Do I get 6,000 if we talk for two hours? Cristina, I know you have all the reasons in the world to hate me, to... Get lost! I'll pretend I had a bad trip... One in which my mother's ghost walked into the toilet... Then we'll both forget we've ever met! Fuck this, I can't spend one normal evening in the city without all the shitheads fucking it up for me! Then I'll see you tomorrow. As for the talking part, we'll see about that! How 'bout I fix us a quick one? Yeah, good idea. Man, are we fucking lucky or what? Can you believe this luck? You still have a long way to go till you raise all the money. Yeah, I'm just saying we're so lucky with this coming out of the blue! Hey, listen, you think you could ask for some more? Look, I really don't wanna have anything to to with her or her money. - Know what I mean? - I know you hate her as it is. But remember we owe 10,000 euros, not 3,000... We'll get by somehow. Listen... What if tomorrow she actually intends to give us more? We're in for it, right? I don't know, we'll see. I mean, what the fuck? If she wants to pay, then let her pay it all! Look, I just wanna erase this whole thing from my head, get it? I really do! I thought you weren't coming anymore. - Hello. - You must be... - Ionut. - Luiza. Nice to meet you. Sorry we're late: We couldn't find a parking space... It's alright. Would you like to go somewhere more quiet for a talk? - Sure! - Not really. Oh, I went over to the bank and got the money. - Do you need it in local currency? - No, we don't. Do you mind my asking what the money is for? You got debts? Yeah, sort of... Afriend of ours helped us a while ago, when there was a fire at our place. So now we have to pay him back... Well, anyway, thanks a lot. I mean, it's quite a lot of money... - I'd like us to talk some more... - That makes one of us. I'm going over to my father's today. Would you like to come? - In the countryside?! - Yes, he'd be happy to see you... - I have stuff to do this weekend... - I'll take care of that for you. - Really, you can go. It's OK. - Thanks, but no thanks. - It's OK if you don't want to come... - I thought I was clear about that. - Come on, it's only one weekend. - Have you lost it, dude? All you gotta do is act like you're mommie's girl, have some brandy and some corn mush with them and return with 10,000 euros in your pock This isn't happening... We're in deep shit and you wanna waste this opportunity? Where else can we get the money from? Can I stop by my place to get some clothes and stuff? - Yeah, sure. The bus leaves at 4. - The bus?! I'll send my chauffeur! - You have a... chauffeur? - It's just a manner of speaking... It's a guy who helps me out every once in a while. - What's keeping him? - He's gotta put some gas... - He's got stuff of his own to do. - I should give you some money. Relax, Ma'am, it's on me. My treat, so to speak. - Anything for my mother-in-law! - Oh, put a sock in it! So how's school and everything? I'm on my way to graduate the Romanian-American University. - What's that? - Business, finance, stuff like that. - What about you, Cris? - What about me? What do you plan on doing next? You mean when I grow up and shit? Yes, something like that. I don't know, but I guess you can come up with something, now that you're here and you care so much about my future and stuff. He's here! - Hey... How are you, bro? - Hey, man! Everything ok? Thanks a lot, dude! This lady here is Cris' mother. She's come from Spain. - I'm Luiza. - Costica. Allow me... Let me get you your bags. There we go... - I left the money on the table. - You'll be there around 7, right? - Goodbye, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Maybe you'll stop by our place when you come back. We'll have some tea... - Yeah, sure... Bye! - Goodbye. Yes, man. It's being taken care of. Do you like this music? I can play something else if you want. Reggae perhaps? - Bob Marley! - No, this one's just fine. Hey, pull over for a second! Are you OK? - No. - What's wrong? I think I'm having an attack. A panic attack? Don't worry about it, I just got a little scared, that's all. Yeah, these attacks really suck! What causes yours? I haven't met my father since the time I got pregnant with you. Father? - Hello, Father. - Hey, welcome! - Did they fix the road? - Yes. Well, that's a surprise... - What are you doing here? - Trying to get rid of these moles. They're all over the place this year! - Welcome. - I couldn't visit you any sooner. - But at least I'm here now. - So you are. I'm happy to see you. - Father, meet my girl, Cristina. - Hello. - Do you know her? - Where could I know her from? Hello. Now that you're here, let's sit on that bench over there! Come on! Look what I have here! - Sandu would like to talk to you... - What, you're his lawyer now? - Is this onion from Bucharest? - No, it's your onion. Grandpa... The onion's a present from Spain. You can tell she's your granddaughter She's just like you. Perhaps, I just can't remember her. I can't rememberof you! You only come by when you need something from me. - Come on, why do you say that? - You know very well why... This isn't real onion. It's not mine! This>is real onion, my onion! - Did you find out about Elena? - What about Elena? - She's ill. Didn't they tell you? - No. She's got... She had a stroke. I can't believe they didn't mention anything to you. At least now you know what kind of man Sandu is. I'm going for a walk. Cristina? Cristina! Cristina... Could you... What? Could you enter the message editor? I'll write the message for you, just tell me what to write. Cristina? No... I don't want to... I don't want to... write anything... I just wanna rest... Can I sit next to you? Of course. Are you OK? Yeah, why do you ask? What do you need all that money for? - Relax, I won't take it from you... - I just want to know. Why the sudden worry? I saw a syringe next to you. - It's glucose with calcium. - Cris... Seriously, I have weak bones. If you had stuck around, you would've known that. Is it heroine? OK we'll stop talking about it. - You have no right anyway! - That's true... But I would really like to know you better. Don't you think it's a little late for that now? I wanted to come and take you with me, Cris, but I couldn't. I couldn't leave Spain before I got my citizenship. - What about now? - I got my citizenship. And? And I got married. I have two Spanish children. You talk about them like they're puppies or something. Yeah, man. Not yet. What am I supposed to do? Wake her up, get the money and leave? Yes, of course I have. So get the fuck off my back! - How much do you guys need? - 10,000 euros. - 10,000?! - Then we'll be clean. That's a lot of money. You don't have to give it to us... We'll talk about this tomorrow. I have to think about it. But, mind you, Chris, this heroine thing is really wrong. Don't you wanna go see a psychiatrist? You think I don't know heroine is wrong? But we're planning to quit anyway. I need a stone from the river. Make sure it's not too big. Alright. And get me some sour cherry tree leafs too, to put on top! Do you think this stone is right for the pickles? Well, a bigger one would've been better, but this one will do. That's all I could find. As for these, I don't know whether they're sour cherry or red cherry... They're fine. Trick or treat! Who's that? Sandu. He must be insane to bring Elena here after she's had a stroke. He couldn't care less as long as there's money in it! If Mohammed won't come to the mountain, the mountain will come to Mohammed! Look, Pops, your family is reunited. I've even brought Elena, so you can see her. - Hello. - Leave those there. How could you bring her over with the state she's in? Do you really wanna see her dead? Get real! She'll bury us all. Lunatics live longer than us, 'cause they don't worry about anythin What's up with you? Why didn't you bother to let us know how you were? So what did you do? You got by? What do you think? I wouldn't worry about you... And I thought you couldn't sleep at night because you worried about me... You look hot. Get away from me! I'd really stick my cock in you... If you had a cock! What's it to you? See, you worried for nothing. This generation is tougher than ours. So, have you talked to the old man yet? I brought it up, but I don't think this is the right time for this... Hell, it ain't! It's the perfect time for it! Would you please call Chidu and tell him to get me out of here? Yes, I'm done... No, I can't take the train, 'cause it doesn't run, Glont! - Why can't you come yourself? - What are you doing? Hello! Glont! Cris, what are you doing? Cris! Cristina, can you tell me what happened? - Cristina! - Back off, will you? Cristina, calm down and tell me what happened! Will you please get the fuck off my back?! I don't need your money, I don't need anything. Just leave me the fuck alone! - But I want to help you, Cristina! - No, you don't! You just wanna help yourself! Go back to fuckin' Spain! Stay away from me, you and your fuckin' family! Cristina! - Look, I also found these. - Let me see. This isn't it, Toni. We need the tabulation form! Keep looking. Check under the mattresses! And make me a cup of coffee. A strong one, like you know best. Greetings, Senator! I'll be there first thing in the morn No, I just want to check if he's got a will or anything. I've got the rest. Everything, yes. No, my wife's the only heir. Her sister gave her share to my wife. Yes, I do have the papers to prove that. Pops, you're really something. I wasn't expecting a st... - Give me a break! - Let me give you a kiss! The tabulation form! Do you know anything about it? Look, after I'm gone, you can do whatever you want! But, as long as I'm around, ask for my permission before going through my stuff! Where's Cristina? Why isn't she here too? Cristina went back to Bucharest. - Any luck, son? - None of them matches... - Any luck, son? - None of them matches... What is it? What happened? He's lost it, my dear. He's locked himself inside. And where is Elena? He seized her! - What do you mean he seized her? - Just like that: He seized her! Open up, Dad, it's me, Luiza. He's got a rifle, you know. Can you hear me, Dad? Open up! Come on, Dad! Kick that crook out of my courtyard or I'll come out and shoot him! Father! Yes, Glont. - When did you talk to her? - Half an hour ago. Do you know anything about a cross? She said something about a cross, where her grandma's buried. There's a cross nearby, but it has nothing to do with her grandma. She gets confused when she's high... Cris! Cris! Cris! - How long has she been on heroin? - She was doing it before I met her. Like two years ago or something. You're killing yourselves. Cris! Glont! Cris! Cris! Step aside! I'll be damned! OK, don't panic, we've been through this before! Come on, grab this! I'm her mother. She took a dose of heroine. This is how I found her. - OK, Ma'am. Please wait outside. - Alright... Find me a vein! Could you please wait outside, Ma'am? I need an EKG! She's in respiratory failure. I need peripheral saturation. I need 10 milligrams of nalorphine. 94... She's got respiratory trigger. I need oxygen in this mask! Give her 1,000 serum. Somebody bring a sheet! - What's wrong with you? - I ran out of cigarettes. - I have some. - I don't change the brand. - I'll call room service. - You don't fucking call... Let me get out! I'd like a cigarette. You really turned into a wise guy, huh? - Wanna spend an extra week here? - No, Doctor... What then? Stay here, we'll write you the papers, and you can have your methadone on Monday if that's what you want most in life. - I see, Doctor... - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - We're here to... I think I know why you're here. Take a seat. Don't be shy. - Pretzels? - No, thanks. - Pretzels? - No, thanks. Andrada, I have a pretty girl in here! - What's your name? - Cristina. Well, Cristina, I'll leave you to Andrada, the nicest girl on Earth, who's going to take you do some tests. Just to see where we stand. Mom will stay here with me. I won't let her go anywhere, don't worry. - So, Mrs. Groza... - My name is Sanchez. She is... She's got her father's name, I get it. Actually, it's my brother-in-law's name... I left the country when Cristina was 3 and a half. She was raised by my sister... But I talked to her on the phone, I sent her money... She had everything she could've wished for... Alright, I didn't state the contrary... Yes, it's just that you give me this look... And what would be the right look in this situation? Glont? Get me out of here, please! Where are you? What the fuck are you doing in the mountains while I'm stuck in this rat hole? Can't you leave for a little while and come pick me up I'm dying in here! Hello. And how are my pretty young ladies today? You're going to get me upset, you kno You promised me something! - Give me your phone... - I can't take it anymore. I wanna go home! You promised you wanted to get well. For that, you have to behave. I promise I'll keep clean. I talked t Glont about it and we're both gonna q But I can't stay here anymore. Everything just narrows down on me... I'm claustrophobic! - They're so itchy! - Itchy? The blankets! Give me my phone back, I wanna call Glont. Your mother called. She wants to know if she can come by to see you. Tell her I'm asleep. She's not even my mother! She came all the way from Spain just to fuck my day. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Did the nurse tell you? Cristina refuses to see me. Madam, that should be the least of your worries... She'll get over it in 2 or 3 days. The problem is what will happen to her when she gets out of here. Who is she staying with? - Her boyfriend. - That's real problem! Did you know he tried to get her out of here last night? No. Do everything you can to rid her of this boy, Madam! Methadone alone won't fix the problem It can diminish the addiction if taken on a regular basis and for a long time. But if the girl stays in the same cir she's going to start over. It's always like that... - I love you a lot. - How much? - Enough. - Enough? Bye! - Cris! - Hello! - What are you doing? - I came to see Cristina. Listen! If you ever approach less than 20 meters from Cristina, you won't be fine. What?! You just forget about Cristina. Erase her number in your address book What if I approach less than 20 meters from her? You won't like it. - I can't guarantee that. - Think about it. OK, let's say I leave her alone. What do I get? - How much do you need? - 8,000 euros. Pretty cheap. - 10,000 and I never see her again. - All right. And I tell you of drug dealing. - Hello. - Good afternoon. Let's go. - Glont told me he'd pick me up. - We decided that I'd do it. - It's OK, he picks me up. - Cristina, I spoke with him. - He's not coming anymore. - Let me call him myself! I'm telling you the two of us talked and he said I can come pick you up. We have to go to the methadone center to register. We promised the doctor we would... Do you really want to spend more time in here? The moron keeps rejecting my calls. You can drop me at my place. No, you're coming with me to the hote You and I are staying together. Staying? What do you mean? You heard me. We'll "hang out" together. Isn't that how you call it I can't believe this! What the fuck do you want from me?! Why the fuck do you barge into my shitty life like this? Back off! And what the fuck did you tell Glont to make him avoid me? You fuckin' paid him or what?! Miss, I won't tolerate this kind of language in my car. You may be used to it from home, but... Cris! Move on, you don't own the fuckin' street! You mother fucker! What's your problem, asshole? Fuck off, dickhead! - Please excuse us... Come on, Cris! - Blow me! Jerk-off! He almost had a heart attack. Did you see the jerk's face? Go on! What?! Why don't we sit there for a second, to catch our breaths? Come on, it's a nice place. How would you like to come with me? You could use a holiday in Spain... I want to see my Andreea...

We'll take her with us. - Do you really mean it? - Yes, I do. - Does your family know about me? - No... So you gonna keep us hidden under the bed or something? Don't worry about that. Of course I'd love to come... Although I barely know you... But yes! Look how beautiful she is, just like a little doll, see? How you doin', crocodile?

It's a book about children living in abnormal families. I mean children who... you know... - Cool! You are a deputy dean... - He's a deputy - That's right. - Why didn't you ever look for me?

Would youto make fun of? - Tell me, do you still love Luiza? - Cris... - She still loves you. - Life is much more complicated. - You'll figure it out one day... - I'm 19 and a half... I'd say I'm already capable to figure it out... I even have a kid So I'm fully grown up. If you'd use your teaching skills, I'm sure you'd make me understand. You're father's a professor, so his explanations might just be too hard to understand for both of us. This is for you... That's a hell of a trip. - And this one is for you. - Thanks. I've been looking forward to this. Mother, father and granddaughter. Another reunited family. Cris, it's me. I fixed you breakfast. It's over here. Are you OK? Did you sleep well? Yeah, I just wasn't sure what reality I woke up in... I have to get going now. I need to go some places... I have to check on Elena, I haven't h from her since I left the countryside When are you guys going to get the passport? - They open at 2. - Alright, make sure you get there. And don't forget to take your methadone. Please. Don't worry, that's one thing you can't forget. Alright then. - Give Elena a kiss from me. - I will. Bye. - What's up with you? - Johnny sent lani and Dacos... - He's expecting the money tonight. - Shhh. Let's go to the balcony. Can you give Johnny a call? What can I possibly tell him? These guys will kill me, man! Do you want them to kill me? Give me your phone. It's switched off. Well, that's what happens when you can't stay away from trouble... You were in this too! Don't deny it, you touched Johnny's stash too! All there's left for you to say is that you did it for me! Oh, and thanks a lot for pulling out after that talk with my mother! Why do you have to take it like that You know I'm in deep shit and I gotta get out of it fast! Can't you see how fucked up this is? Besides, I knew she was gonna take care of you. So they fixed you up... Yes, I'm on methadone. Really? Can I have one? You need a prescription for that. Go to the hospital and get one... Come on, I just wanna taste it... I'm going to Spain with my mother. You are? How long are you staying? As long as I want to. Maybe for ever. I'll get a job or something... I've taken Andreea from the home and we'll both stay at my mother's. Great, so you don't know how long you're gonna stay. What about us? - What about us? - Us! I don't know. Great! - I wanna quit. - So do I, Cris, but... - And I want us to take a break. - Man, she's brainwashed you! - Fuck you! - You too! Fuckin' retard! You sure you wanna do this? - Do what? - Go to fucking Spain and shit! - And break up with me... - Yes, I'm sure I wanna do this. What about me? What am I gonna do, Cris? Come on, call the guy. Hello, Johnny. Hello. Hey, you're right on time. There's no one here to help me. Let's switch places for a second. I'll go check on that porridge. Cristina? Cristina? What? Er... Dunno, you didn't use to be so high on religion and shit... Such is life... It changes people. How are you, Cris? How's your life going? Well, I haven't changed that much... I've thought a lot about you lately. Maybe that's why you called me today... - Why would that be? - Cause I thought a lot about you? Oh, well, I've thought a lot about you too lately! Yeah. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about a friend of mine... He did a really stupid thing, he tampered with some of your stash... - You mean Glont? - Yeah... He thought he'd hit the jackpot, but... And now you wanna save him from burning in hell? Kindda... And what would people say if I let this guy get away unpunished? I'm not saying you should let him get away with it. Just give him more time to raise the money. It's a lot of money... His sins are plenty too: He cheated, he lied, he stole... Your friend has got to pay me back! What if I gave you the money? I'm going to my mother's in Spain, so... This isn't about money, it's about principles! Romanians don't have principles anymore! They're all a bunch of cattle, of wiseass worms! They need someone who sees things more clearly, don't you think? - Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure... - You used to be smarter as a child! I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand what you mean... I mean the only way to redemption goes through the flames of hell! Excuse me for a second. Yes. At a friend's place. I don't know, 10 minutes, 15 maybe, why do you ask? Stelea Spataru 8... Why, something happened? OK, bye... Could you please tell me where the bathroom is? It's over there. Yes, she's in the bathroom. No, she doesn't know anything. I'll come up there. Cristina! - What's up? - Where's Andreea? - I left her with Glont at the hotel. - That's where I'm coming from! Let me call Glont. - Are you alright? - Yes. He's rejecting my call. Keep trying. - Man, why is he rejecting my call? - Shouldn't we call the police? Cristina! Johnny! I'll call you back! Hold on a second, Johnny. While I was at your place, I left my girl at the hotel with Glont. - Yeah, so? - They're and I can't reach Glont. - Yeah, so? - They're and I can't reach Glont. I can't help you, Cris, I'm sorry. I have a really important meeting. Fuck it, Johnny, please help me find Andreea! Try to understand, Cris, I really can't. All I can do for you is this. Dacos, there's something I need you to do, man. There's this guy I asked you to keep an eye on... - Glont. - Glont, some guy named Glont. Yeah, the one with the stash. It looks like the guy kidnapped Cris' baby. Yeah, great! I'll let you talk to her. Here! Hey, I left them at the hotel to come to see Johnny. What park? He was a fucking mess after your visit. - Gotta get some flowers and then... - So you won't help me! You haven't changed a bit! Relax, you'll be alright! You, on the other hand, are a completely different person! Are you free? Listen... Follow that BMW. - I beg of you, make that call now! - We know what we have to do! Dispatch? Who's on patrol at Sfanta Vineri? Gullit? Put him through. Simona, would you be so kind as to give the lady a form to fill? Hello, Gullit? Yes, Mastacan here. Don't you know my voice anymore? Or are you too busy doing something in the car? Listen, we got a kidnapped child! Yes, we're still on for six, I told y It involves junkies, man. The guy's name is Glont. Wait for me here. Good evening, I'm with Johnny. I just been to the beauty parlor and I'm a little late, you know... He came in before me. I called him to wait for me, but he was in another call. You want me to call him again? - Have you been here before? - Of course! Then you know the way. We should ship them via Bulgaria, then Greece, then on to South of Italy by boat. We have our people, why should we risk? - What about the papers? - It's OK. You know those who get the organs get the doners' craziness. Are you gonna join us, Violeta? I thought you didn't like fish. You Romanians like pork... I brought an extra portion for the young lady who's with Mr. Johnny. - Did you bring someone? - No. There was a young lady who said she's here with Mr. Johnny, that she'd been to a beauty parlor, what do I know? Wait a minute, I know what this is about. - Is the security system on? - Turned it off when Mr. Johnny came. - Turn it back on! - Yes. Hi! I thought you were... I couldn't.
