[Aaron] Got anymore room in that basket? Wow, you didn't have to do that. Yeah, it's no big deal. I'm still trying to get the rise in the bread right, though. It's not quite there yet. Tasha's going to love it. Hey, this looks good. For real. It's just a meal. And you made most of it, mister chef extraordinaire. Wannabe chef. And it's more than just a meal, it's... It's comfort. It's opening the fridge and knowing you have one less thing to do on your list. Wow, that was quite the pitch. I've been working on it for a while. - [Aaron] Did it land? - Ten out of ten. Nice. You know, I think we could make a real go at this. Make a go of what? Make it a legit business. Ha! Very funny. I'm not kidding. [Aaron] Think about it. I could go back to culinary school. I'll develop all the recipes. You can handle the business side of things. - [water running] - [Renee] Oh! [Aaron] Whoa. Oh, hey, hey, hold on. We need to call a plumber. I'm going to fix it tomorrow. I promise. Seriously, what do you think? I think that you can't just start a business. Takes money, a lot of it. And we're barely able to keep our head above water as it is. [Aaron] Okay, well, what if we move back to New York? We could rent that place in Brooklyn again. Maybe start a family like we always talked about? I can't afford that. Or have you conveniently forgotten about this mountain of medical bills? We could if we sold the house. [soft music] I can't do that. [Renee] My mom loved this house. It's all I have left of her. [Aaron] I know, I know. But I don't think she would want you working yourself to the bone just to pay for it. Don't you think she would have wanted us to sell the house? It's not the right time. [soft music continues] [footsteps clomping] [soft music continues] I just want to know one thing, and then I will let it go. - Okay. - Are you happy? For real. Because if you are, put on the shirt and tie and I'll sell insurance till I'm blue in the face. But if you're not. Let's start over. - Aaron... - Renee, this is your life. Our lives. They're going by fast. I just don't think there's ever going to be the perfect time to take that next step. [soft music continues] Sometimes you got to take a chance. Think about it, okay? [Aaron] See you after work. - [footsteps clomping] - [soft music continues] [upbeat music] - [brakes squealing] - [car stalling] [car door clicks] [car door slams] [upbeat music continues] [car beeps] [Tasha] That garland looks amazing above the door. [Tasha] Would you mind hanging this one in the back? Thanks so much. Hey, Santa. Welcome, your station's over here. And an elf. I love the outfit. [chuckles] Good morning. Hey hey. - What is all this? - For you. - No way. - Way. I mean, Aaron made most of it. I just put it together. You didn't have to, but is this fresh bread? Is it warm? Bless you. - [footsteps clomping] - [ambient jazz music] Is everything okay? Yeah, it's fine. Nothing a brisk walk and a piece of pie won't fix. Well spill it, girl. I can't take any more questions about the baby or how I'm feeling. I need that good old fashioned drama in my life. I think Aaron's having a mid-life crisis. - Why? - [gentle music] He wants us to quit our jobs, move to New York City, sell the house, and have a kid. -Wow -[Renee] I know. Isn't that insane? Oh, no, not really. Are you kidding? I know you. Me? I couldn't wait to quit my job at the diner and move to the burbs. But you? You love New York. I only lived there three months before Mom got sick, so. It's long enough to miss it. I think it's a good plan. That's all I'm saying. Well, I don't think it's a plan at all. I think it's a pie in the sky fantasy. [Tasha] Do you really want to work here until the end of time? Jeff's going to retire soon and he's going to make me manager. Jeff has been about to retire for five years. And when he does, that means better pay, better hours. Do you really want to run the store? [Jeff] Good morning, ladies. Good morning, Jeff. - Morning. - Well, we only have one hour before showtime. And we're ready. [Jeff] Good, because it would be a buzzkill for the kids to find out that the presents are all just empty boxes. [all laugh] We sell the magic here, ladies. That's what we do. - So, make them... - [Renee] Magical, yes. What's this? Oh, that's um. I thought we talked about this? You cannot go ordering merchandise without my approval. Oh, I, I wouldn't... I've already made a deal with the vendors about placement. There's just no room for this. - [Jeff sniffs] - It's... - I, uh... - Maybe next year though, huh? - [Renee] Uh. - [footsteps clomping] He's going to eat that all himself, isn't he? - [curious music] - Yep. - [cheerful music] - [people chattering] Hi! Just a few more weeks, and I'll know for sure that I created my husband's clone. Do you think it's a boy? Yeah, my parents have put money on it. I have three nephews and counting, so it kind of feels like my genetic destiny. What do you think? I think it'll be the luckiest baby in the world, no matter what. Because they'll have you as their mom. Aw. You can't say nice things like that to me. I mean, nothing's going to deter customers like a crying employee. [both laugh] Hey, there's a break in the line. You want to make a wish? - Oh, it's okay. Thank you. - [curious music] [Cici] Are you sure? You get a toy. [Tasha] Oh, well, in that case. - Seriously? - Hey, I'm not above this. I can take all the help I can get right now. [Tasha] Hey, Santa. The thing I would like more than anything else on the planet is a very short and very painless labour. - Aw. - But if you can't get me that, I would take an air fryer instead. - [laughs] Tasha. - [Tasha] Thank you. It's your turn, Missy. Uh, it's okay. Really, thank you. [curious music continues] Hi. Are you sure? You never know. Your wish just might come true. Oh, maybe next year. Well, in the meantime, take this at least. If you change your mind, make a wish and ring that bell. [people chattering] Thank you. [broom sweeping] - [footsteps clomping] - [suspenseful music] - [door knocking] - [Jeff] Come in. - [curious music] - [Jeff] Hmm. Renee, good. Uh, look. Do you mind locking up? I'm late for supper with Tess. Oh, sure. Yeah, of course. - Want some? - No, Thank you. Your loss. - [basket thuds] - [Renee gasps] - [Jeff sighs] - [Jeff grunts] Before you go, I was wondering if I could talk to you - about... - About what? You had mentioned that you would be retiring in the new year and we had briefly discussed me stepping into your role. So, I was wondering... Retirement? [Jeff] Not this year. Tess wants to go to Italy, and I just bought a new electric car. Wow a car. Let's reconvene next year, all right? - Mhmm. Yeah. - Great. [footsteps clomping] [Jeff] See you tomorrow. - [curious music] - [bell jingles] - [door slams] - [bell jingles] [gentle music] - [Renee shrieks] - [body thuds] [curious music] - [Renee grunts] - [car door clicks] [car door slams] [Renee shrieks] [sighs] - [keys click] - [car stalls] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. [car stalls] [phone chimes] [Aaron] Hey, babe. I'm stuck in a meeting. I'm going to be home late. - I love you. - Aaron. [sighs] [enchanting music] No, no, no. [sighs] [gentle music] I wish for... [gentle music continues] A different life. [bell jingles] [wind whistles] [bell jingles] [chuckles] Of course. - [hands thud] - [sighs] [gentle music] [gentle music continues] [phone ringing faintly] [phone ringing faintly] [footsteps clomping] Wait. [chair thuds] [phone ringing faintly] [dramatic music] Whoa! Okay. [faint traffic noises] - [dramatic music continues] - [Renee shrieks] [face slaps] Wake up! - [feet stomping] - Wake up, Renee! [Renee hollering] Ow! Ow! Okay. Okay. - [curious music] - [tree rustling] Oh! So, we're here. It's a really nice bag. - [phone beeps] - [phone rings] - [Aaron] Hello? - Hey, Aaron, babe. Okay, did I crash my car? Because I woke up in a very strange office in New York, and I think... you're not Aaron? Sorry, what do you mean, you don't know who Aaron is? This is his number. Please put him on. This is not the time to play jokes. Hmm? [curious music continues] Did I get the number wrong? [phone thuds] Hey, morning. Morning. Ready for this meeting? What meeting? - Who are you? - [Jerry laughs] That's funny. Come on, let's go. [curious music continues] So I know this was supposed to be department heads only, but we're going to have all of marketing sitting in just in case we want to pull the trigger on your plan - right away. - My plan? Yeah, or plans. Do you have more than one? You know what? Don't tell me. Tell the whole team. [Jerry] Good morning, everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting. [footsteps clomping] Sorry, good morning. [curious music continues] We have fun here, right? [Jerry] Please open those binders in front of you to page three, if you will. As you can see, after five years as the world's fastest growing meal kit delivery service, which we should be proud of, profits have started to slow. There's no need to worry. We're not in the red or anything, but we will be by the end of next quarter if something doesn't change. [curious music] Oh, that's, unfortunate? Yes, it is, because for the first time since our inception, unfortunately, Harvest Plate has overtaken us in market cap. [Renee] What? This was more profitable than harvest plate? It was. And you know what? It will be again. Thanks to our fearless leader who has spent the entirety of last week outlining a plan to boost sales before the end of the year. I can't wait to hear what this plan is. Take it away, Renee. [Jerry] Take it away, Renee. Right, because I am the CEO? [Jerry laughing] I think someone maybe forgot her morning coffee. [Jerry laughs] Um. [clears throat] Right well, [clears throat] thank you. As they say in business, I got a lot of irons in the fire, so I'm going to need to study this thing thoroughly and come up with our next plan of action. [curious music continues] Can we reschedule? Reschedule this meeting that we literally just started right now? - [Renee] Yeah. [Jerry] Um, of course we can. Great, okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [footsteps clomping] [Jerry] Renee, I don't know what's going on with you today. I hope you're taking this seriously. If we don't figure something out by the end of the year, we're going to be getting into layoff territory. And you can forget about our European expansion. That'll be off the table. I'll figure something out, I promise. [Jerry] All right. Thank you. [footsteps clomping] [Jerry] All right, let's give the boss some space today, okay? [panting] [Maria] Hey, honey. [gentle music] I hope it's okay. I had to come downtown for a hair appointment, so I thought I'd just pop in for a quick hello. Mom? And I made some treats for you to share with the office, so. - [Maria] Renee? - [body thuds] [Maria] Renee? Wake up, honey. Come on. Come on. Hi, hi. Are you okay? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - [Maria] Are you okay? - One, two, three, four, five. - What do you need? - One, two, three, four, five. - Some water? Can I get a doctor, honey? What can I do? There was something in the coffee. How many cups did you have? You know you can't handle more than two or you get the shakes. Here, here, sweetheart. Wait, wait, wait. I have some, yes. Okay. Drink this. Drink this. Come on. Take it, take it. Drink it back, honey. Drink it back. That a girl. [Maria] Yeah, uh huh. [Maria sighs] You're real? You've been burning the candle at both ends. Here, honey. Eat something. - Give me that. - Thank you. Come on, take one. - Mom? - Well of course. [gentle music] [Maria] Oh, oh. [sobbing] Oh, I missed you so much. I missed you, too. You're back. You're, you're, you're okay? - Well... - I mean, you're, you're, you're feeling good? You look... Yeah, I'm great. But you, you, my beautiful girl, you clearly need to rest. So I want you to lie down. Head down. Head down. Okay, all right, now listen to me. You're not going to like what I have to say, but I really think you should cancel the rest of your meetings for today. I think that's a great idea. - Really? - Yeah. - Great. - And you're okay? [Maria] I'm okay. Then I'll guess I'll leave you to it. Yeah. [Maria] Okay. No, wait. What? Where are you going? Oh, I'm just going to go home. No, no, no. Please, please stay. We can, um. - We can go to lunch. - [Maria] Lunch? Oh, wow. We haven't done that in years. Really? Actually, can I take a rain check? Obviously, you're not a hundred percent, and traffic's about to get bad. And I heard that we might get some snow, so I really should just be getting home. Home, in Maplewood? Yeah. So you live in your home on Birch Crescent? Yes, and honestly, I'm one more question away from taking you to the emergency room. Oh, no, no, don't. I would like to stay. I would like to not go anywhere. Yeah, no, it's just, um. It must have been low blood sugar. We had a crazy meeting and... Okay, well listen, you eat at least half of those cookies. Thank you for making me cookies. Okay, I'm going to go, but I'm going to call you later. Call me later? [Maria's lips smack] Okay. [lips smack] - Half of the cookies. - Mmm! I love you. I love you, too, honey. - [door clicks] - [footsteps clomping] [curious music] [gentle music] Months of texts. Look at all these text messages. Can't sleep. Canceling on her. Oh, look at the sweet pictures. Oh, Aaron. Aaron. - Aaron, where are you? - [curious music] She's at Maplewood. We would be at... Oh, okay Renee! [upbeat music] Okay. Okay. [keys jingle] Yes. [curious music] Ah! - [planter thuds] - [Renee] Yes! [door clicks] Aaron? Honey, I'm home. Oh, boy. Wow, something very weird is going on. I don't know if this is an intense, lucid dream or what, but I fell asleep in our car and woke up in a very strange office. My office, I guess, because apparently here I'm the CEO of a company. My company. And I know you would say that that makes sense. But babe, to me, this is all feeling a little bit insane. Kind of like this room. What? We can do so much better. Oh, and then there's my mom, who is alive... [both scream] Babe! - Renee? - Aaron? Renee, what are you doing here? Oh, my mom said, "Renee, you could take the day off." - And so... - No. no. What are you doing here? In my apartment? Our apartment? - Funny. - [Renee] I don't know. I'm not trying to be funny. I'm not trying to be funny. [Aaron] I don't know what kind of game you're playing here, but I'm pretty sure I gave you all your stuff back when we broke up. [gentle music] Apparently I should have asked for the key back. Are you eating my food? Huh? Nope. So, um, what is it? Is it your Game of Thrones books? Your DVD collection? You know those are obsolete now, right? They're not, because the bloopers are on the DVD and also the director's cut. Fair. Okay. Which one is it? Can we make this quick? Because I don't want to be late for work. No, of course not. Where do you work? Salt and Stone. The restaurant in Tribeca? I'm the chef? Wow Aaron, that's amazing. You did it? A real chef? Yeah, I've been there five years now. Part owner, too. Started there right after we, um. Oh, I see. - So, um. - Yes, right. Just grab whatever you... Oh... [items rustling] Ah! This is it. Wow, gosh. Been missing The True Meaning of Christmas. [curious music] Right. I'm so sorry for barging in. [Renee] Oh, not cool. - [footsteps clomping] - [curious music continues] I'm just going to, yeah, I'm going to go. [footsteps clomping] [curious music continues] - [car honks] - [Renee shrieks] It looks like you could use a ride. Oh, no thank you, Renee. Renee. Trust me, you're going to want to get in. I'm sorry. Do I know you? What do you think? [bells jingle] Oh, you're the elf. [Cici] Ding, ding, ding. But just call me Cici. Now get in. [dramatic music] - [car engine revs] - What is going on? [tires squeal] [Cici] Well, let's start at the beginning. What's the last thing you remember? Um, okay. I was in my car, it wouldn't start, and I was really upset and... [dramatic music continues] - Oh. - Yeah. - But no. - [Cici] Oh, yep, yep. - That's impossible. - [Cici] I assure you it's not. - So, me here is... - A different life. Oh, great. - Okay. - [Cici] Take some deep breaths. In and out. Trust me, this happens all the time. I don't know, I don't understand. Why would Aaron and I break up? Sounds like something you should ask him. Oh, yeah. No, that's a good idea. I'll just go back into his apartment and play a quick game of twenty questions. May I suggest a different tactic? Oh, well, my mom is she, is she better or does she not get sick at all? - I mean... I should ask her. - Again... There you go! You're catching on. - Okay. - Let's keep doing that. Yeah wait. Wait, no, I don't understand. What am I supposed to do? Well, you wished for this life, and now you get a chance to live it. So go on, live it. Embrace it! How do I, how do I get in touch with you? What if I need help or something? - Or... - Ring the bell. [curious music] - I don't have the bell. - Check your purse. Whoa. So if you ring that bell, I'll be right there. But try to use it sparingly. Christmas is a busy season for me. - I bet. - Actually, I've got a jet, so. - [tires screech] - [bells jingle] What? I don't know where I'm going. Renee, you lived here before. You'll figure it out. [car engine revs] Okay. We are... Oh, come on. Really? Not cool. Tasha! [upbeat music] [Tasha] Coffee? Tasha! Hi! Oh wow, I'm so happy to see you. I'm so sorry. Have we met? We get a lot of regulars in here. No no, we haven't. And I'm starving. Do you recommend anything? The turkey sandwich and fries. And I make a wicked hot chocolate. Yes, that, please. Thank you. So, are you from around here, or are you just visiting? Oh, I just moved here. I guess. I'm having a little bit of a day. [Tasha] Well, lay it on me. Is it work stuff? Family stuff? Relationship stuff? Kind of all three? - There you are. - [Renee] Thank you. So, what's going on? For starters, there's my mom, who I thought was... Sick, and it turns out that she's not. Okay, that seems like a good thing. Definitely, so good. And I have a job. A new job that is so much work and I have no idea what I'm doing. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, Imposter Syndrome is a beast. No kidding. And the funny thing is, this is actually like my dream life. Only it's not because my husband and I... Well we're not together anymore. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - [gentle music] I never even considered a world where we weren't together. Are you sure it's over over? Oh, well, apparently it's been a while, so he's probably moved on. Okay, but do you know that for sure? No, I guess not. Then you know what you got to do. Get him back. To having it all. - [upbeat music] - [glasses clink] To having it all. [Tasha] There you go. [curious music] [Maria] Renee? [Maria] Hey, Renee? - Hey, Renee. - [Renee gasps] [laughs] What are you doing here? Lost my key? How did that happen, honey? You have a doorman 24/7. - I do? - [Maria] It's Manhattan. - It's kind of standard. - [doorbell rings] Oh, I'm so sorry about this, but I wasn't expecting you. And I have plans, so. Oh. Coming! - Manhattan? - [Maria] Hello. [Maria] Hi, ladies. Good morning. There's some coffee in the kitchen help yourself. - [woman] Thank you, Maria. - [Renee] Good morning. Hi, nice to see you. [Maria] We're packing up the Christmas dinner donations for the food bank. Hey, you know, you could stay and help if you want? You used to love doing this stuff. Of course. Take that. [laughs] [Maria] Over here, sweetheart. [Maria] Are you sure you're okay? Fine, never better. - Uh. - [curious music continues] I ran into Aaron yesterday. Oh, wow. How'd that go? Good, I can't stop thinking about what went wrong with us. Oh, honey, that was such a hard season in your life. You really have to stop blaming yourself. I left him? Yeah, but you were trying to build your company, and then Jerry came on board and things really took off. I mean, you got busy. Yeah, I was, I guess. And look what you've done. You built an entire company, and it's thriving. Was thriving. What are you talking about? Jerry says I have to come up with an idea or we have to lay people off. - [Maria] Oh no. - I know. Oh, dear. People are depending on me, and I don't know what I'm doing. [Maria] Well, that's not true. Honey, you have been doing some version of, I don't know, this, your whole life. Well, before you turned it into a business. - Sugar? - Yes please. Try to remember why you started the company in the first place, hmm? Do you remember, to help people, to give back to the community? Right, just like you. What? Oh. - [both chuckle] - [lips smack] [gentle music] That's it. What's it? - Christmas dinner boxes. - [Maria] Oh. And for every one purchase, we could give one to a family in need. Renee, that is such a great idea. And we'll make them available to everyone, not just our subscribers. Now you're cooking. Oh, I wish we could make them fresh. You know, not just frozen meals in the mail. You could hire a chef? Aaron. And that might be a good way for the two of you to spend some time together again. You know, if that was something you were interested in. Yeah, that would be something that I'm interested in. [Renee] Oh, I love you. [Maria] I love you, too. [Renee] Thank you. Oh, no, don't thank me. This is all you, sweetheart. I get all my best ideas from you. Aw, just promise me one thing. You won't let Jerry talk you out of this, right? Okay, not this one. Okay, so what are you waiting for? Go get him. Okay, I'm going. This is me going. - Are you sure you're okay? - [Maria] Of course. I have everything that I need. Oh, but you don't. Cut yourself a new key, sweetheart. Right. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay, I'll see you soon. I love you. Yeah, I love you, too. Hey, Siri, what's my address?

I can see if he has a minute. [curious music] - [Aaron] Renee? - Hey! - Hey. - [Renee] Hi. What are you doing here? Oh, I just wanted to talk to you about a business proposition. Oh. Um, maybe we could have a sec... Maybe we could... [chuckles] Maybe we could sit, just the two of us, for a second. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Thanks.

Yeah no, they would be, huh? Anyway, you were saying? Right. I was saying that my company is developing a Christmas dinner meal kit, and I want to hire you to design the recipe. Oh. Wow. Yeah I mean, you're an incredible chef, and our brands are compatible. Home grown comfort food with a twist. And you're perfect. You'd be perfect for this. Um. Right. That's interesting. We're just, things are a little crazy. It's very busy right now, so I... It wouldn't be that much of a time commitment. No, no, no, no, no. These boxes are going to have to be out ASAP. And so, Christmas Eve? Max, and we would be working together? Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem, right? No, shouldn't. But now's just not really a good time. But, hey, there's tons of amazing chefs in the city. I'm sure you'll find somebody great. Wait, wait, Aaron, I don't want some other chef. I want you, for the job. I want you for the job. I'm sorry. I can't. What, I don't understand. Is it me? Is this about yesterday? I'm sorry. I didn't know. It's not that. Then what is it? [soft music] Closed? Everything I use in my kitchen is from a local farm and it got bought up by a developer and... Till I find a new supplier, - It's... - Oh, wow. I'm sorry. [Aaron] Perils of doing business, I guess. I need to lay off half the staff temporarily. It's been hard. That's terrible. I wish there was something I could do. [curious music] - I can help you. - Renee. I'm not looking for a favour. No, it wouldn't be a favour. It would be a business deal. You help me with the recipes, and I'll connect you with our suppliers. I mean, at least to bridge the gap of time until you find a new farm. I can tell you want to say yes. So you might just want to say yes. [curious music] Do it. Do it. - Do it. Do it. - Yes. - Yes! - All right. Oh. Deal. You won't regret it, I promise. We'll see about that. [cheerful music] So what do you think? I'm going to have to run the numbers. Can we just sell the boxes? Do we really have to donate meals? Jerry. Yes, that's the whole point. This affirms our values and gives us a chance to give back to community. I think that that's what our customers care about. Yeah until Harvest Plate gives away the same thing for $5 cheaper. Harvest Plate, shmarvis plate. Think about the numbers. See our subscriptions skyrocketing. Choo-choo. Choo-choo, choo. - That's not the sound of money... - Cha-ching. - Cha-ching. Cha-ching. - Cha-ching? It's just... It feels like a gamble at an inopportune time. You know what I mean? Maybe if we did a big media blitz, maybe. Yes, yes, Jerry. A big media blitz. See, now we're on the same page. And they're going to be so high quality. In fact, I've already gone ahead and hired a chef who's going - to design the whole thing. - Who? Aaron Thompson of Salt and Stone. Your ex-boyfriend, Aaron Thompson? Um, yeah, I think he was my ex-boyfriend. But now we're just, we're friends. Are you sure that's a good idea? Yeah, absolutely. He's the best guy for the job. [curious music] I don't know. You know what? I think you're just going to have to trust me on this one. Think about how long we've known each other. How long have we known each other? A long time. A long time. I was going to say the same thing. - I just, I have this feeling... - Which I respect. It's just the numbers tell us that... The numbers are telling us that what we're doing now isn't working. We got to be bold! I think this is the answer we've been looking for. [Jerry sighs] - Okay. - Really? - Yeah. - Yes! I'll get the pitch over to marketing and we can get started. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the idea. It's my first pitch. It's definitely not your first pitch. We've pitched together many times. Yeah, of the day. - [Jerry] Ah. - It's my first pitch today. [Jerry laughing] What? [quirky music] Oh! [soft music] - [Renee] Hey! Hey. - [Aaron] Hey. It's beautiful. Oh, thanks. It's usually a little busier. Do I sense some nerves in your voice? What? No. Well, you know, you don't have to worry around me. I can barely make a piece of toast. So whatever you come up with, I'm going to love. Okay, I'm going to hold you to that. I'll just walk you through these sample recipes here. Sounds great. And hey, thanks for seeing me so last minute. No problem. I'm here every day anyway. Every day? Oh, yeah. No Thursday night hockey? No. Oh man, I haven't played hockey in years. Well, that just won't do. Wait where are you going? Come on.

Yeah, shoot. What happened between us? You know, from your perspective. Straight for the jugular, huh? Yes, sir. Well, you would have started the company by then. And you had just hired that guy, Jerry. He had big plans for expansion, and suddenly we were spending less and less time together, which, don't get me wrong, I completely understood. But then.. What? You asked me for a break. [people chattering] - Remember? - Right. Yeah, right. I did wait for a while, but. Eventually, anyway. Are we going to do this? I'm ready if you're ready. - [stick thuds] - Okay, tell me about this menu. Well, we got a few options. - [stick thuds] - Hit me. Ha ha! Okay, option one. Seared turkey breast, but Valentine style to kind - of elevate it a little bit. - [Renee] Ooh. Bacon pan fried Brussels sprouts. - Ooh. - Tureen, roasted potatoes. And I thinking maybe a yam pecan mini tart for dessert. Sold. You don't want to hear option two? Nope, when I see something I like, I go for it.

Oh. Yeah, definitely. Come by the restaurant, tomorrow night? I'll be there. -Great -Great. So I guess this is a good night. Night. [gentle music continues] [uplifting music] [footsteps clomping] [wall knocks] Hey, hey, the official taste tester has arrived. Oh, what's this? She comes bearing gifts? What? For me? No, for Ashley. Is she here? [chuckles] Yes for you. Thank you. You look nice. Thanks. So do you. Thanks. [Renee chuckles] - I love it. - [Renee laughs] Oh, wait, there's more. There's more. Yeah you haven't loved all of it yet. Okay, let's see what else we got. Oh, Wow. - Yeah this is... - Perfection. Took the words right out of my mouth, here. Yeah, I was going to go with excessive. - But, sure. - Oh, no way. [gentle music continues] I need a picture of this. [laughs] Yes, that. All right, okay. [Renee] Oh, yes. Okay this isn't going on some website or something, is it? That's brilliant. - What? - For the website. - No, no, no, no. - Please? No, no. You have no idea how endearing you look right now. We'll sell out instantly. How endearing? - Excessively. - On a scale of one to ten? Eleven. Well, in that case, yeah, let's do it. - [Renee] Great! - But I expect royalties.

[Aaron] So he's always like... [soft music] [both laughing] So did that live up to your expectations? Should I be pitching option two? [Renee] Oh, no. No option two. That was better than I expected. Good. Honestly. Thank you. This has been... Yeah, for me too. [soft music continues] - I'm sorry. - No, don't be sorry. - No, I... - It's not. It's just... - It's just a lot. - Yeah. I mean, I haven't talked to you in years, and then suddenly you're here and you're acting like nothing's changed. It's just. I get it. I get it. Also I'm not sure how long I'm going to be in the city. [Renee] What are you talking about? I've been thinking about selling my shares in the restaurant. What? But now that we have a new supplier, thanks to you, it feels like the right time. And if I don't do it now, I might regret it, you know? Aaron, food. It's your passion. Let's just say cooking for you tonight is the most fun I've had doing it in years. [soft music continues] Wow, what are you going to do instead? Probably go back to Pittsburgh and stay with my folks for a bit. Start up something out there once I've had a chance to reset. And when do you plan on doing that? I'm heading home tomorrow for the holidays and I'm going to get the ball rolling from there. Wow, so soon? [footsteps clomping] Oh, hey. Hey, wow, it's late. - What are you doing here? - [Ashley] I know. I just wanted to add a couple of things to the order going out tomorrow. [Ashley] Uh, do you want to go over it? Uh, yeah. I probably should. I can let myself out. It's easy. Thank you for dinner. [soft music continues] You're welcome. Night. good night. [gentle music] [classical music plays from alarm] [alarm thuds] [enchanting music] [bell jingles] [doorbell rings] Woo hoo! Nice place! Yeah it's great. So you rang. I need to ask you a favour. - Okay. - I need another wish. No, don't get me wrong. No, I appreciate everything you've done for me already, - But? - I need Aaron back. I'm sorry. That's just not how this works. Nothing in life is guaranteed. All we can do is appreciate the time that we have with one another, and then the rest is out of our control. [gentle music] [elevator dings] - [gentle music continues] - [people chattering] [Jerry] Pretty crazy, huh? It feels like yesterday it was just and me in here. We've come a long way. Yeah, I guess we have. - [footsteps clomping] - [phone ringing faintly] So, did you see the pre-sale reports? I did. Those new subscriber numbers are growing, and all the press around the donations has been really incredible. So that was a nice touch. Right but it wasn't just for the good press. Oh, no, of course not. Of course not. Actually, can we hire someone to check with Food Bank and make sure they're receiving everything okay? You know, that's not really in the budget, huh? Hmm? But yeah, sure. Thank you. Oh, and before I go, I'm just going to need you to sign this right here. What's this? Did you not read the email from the board? If we manage to get six thousand new subscribers before Christmas they're going to approve the European expansion. Oh, right. I got to say, launching this expansion on the heels of this holiday success? It's the perfect springboard. Everything we could have hoped for. It's the perfect springboard we've been waiting for, Jerry. Okay, I will look this over. No, no. It's the same thing we laid out a year ago. Okay. [Renee] Yeah, woo. [Jerry] Great, I will take this to legal immediately and I'll see you at the Christmas party tomorrow. Christmas party tomorrow? No. Oh, you should see your face, Jerry. I got you good. - Renee, you're killing me. - Of course, I'll be at the Christmas party tomorrow. [Jerry] Not funny. Hey, if this gets approved, we'll probably need more staff, right? [Jerry] Oh, absolutely. Tons of people. [gentle music] Thanks for coming. Are you looking for a rematch? Because I'm not going easy on you this time. Oh, wow. You did not go easy on me last time. That's true. No, I wanted to talk to you about something. - [gentle music continues] - Okay. What if you came to work with me? Permanently. You could be our resident chef, you know, design all the menus and hire your own staff. You would be free to do all the things you do best, and I would handle the business side of things. Wow. I know this might sound crazy to you, but it doesn't to me. I always pictured us doing this together and... This could be our chance. [gentle music continues] We could really start over, Aaron. Um. That's very generous offer. But I do think I owe it to myself to really think this through, you know? Yeah of course. Listen, my company is having a holiday party tomorrow, and I know you're trying to get back to Pittsburgh, but maybe you could just swing by, meet everyone, and selfishly, we could talk one more time before you go. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. [gentle music continues] [Maria] Are you sure you want me to be there? I mean, it's a company party. Exactly, you have to be there. You are the Maria of Maria's meals, after all. [Maria chuckles] Oh, perfection. - It is nice. I love it. - You love it? Oh, and I was thinking we should do New Years together. You know, we could go out to a really nice dinner, go dancing, the works. I'd love to, honey, but I'm leaving on my trip. Remember? What trip? I fly to Japan the day after Christmas, and then I'm off to Bali, Australia and New Zealand and then across to Chile. Wow, right. No, I forgot. I just felt like this was the right time. It's time to seize the day, as they say. Oh, of course it is. You, you are going to go and have so much fun. There's something else. Come. [clears throat] I'm putting the house up for sale in the new year. [gentle music continues] Wait what? I know it seems sudden, but I really have been thinking about this for a long time. But you love that house. I do. Yes, I do. But at the end of the day, it's just a place. There's a whole world out there, and I want to see it. Hey, why don't I come see you on the trip? - Are you? Oh, I would love that. - Yeah. - Really? - Yes! Me too. [gentle music continues] So there's really just one question left. What? What are you going to wear? Hmm? The green one or...? Oh, no, the green one. - [both laughing] - [upbeat music] Oh, this is beautiful. Did you do this? Yeah all for myself. You didn't, no. [both laughing] He'll be here honey, don't worry. Thanks. Ah, there you are. - [Renee] Hi. - [Jerry] Hi, Maria! Good to see you. Glad you could come celebrate with us tonight. Well I'm happy to be here. I hope you don't mind, but I need - to steal Renee for a minute. - Of course. Yeah I'll just... I'll come find you after. So the whole board is here. There's a lot to discuss, trust me. But first, your annual toast. What? My toast? You have to be kidding. I have been practicing all day. Jerry, you walked right into that one. Okay. Yeah, I did. - Ah. - Oh, Thank you. I got this. [Renee] Ooh, it's a lot of people. - [ambient jazz music] - [people chattering] - [glass clinking] - Good evening, everyone. That one worked. Oh, that's bright. Ter than last year. Okay, um, we all know why we're here. Oh, wow. There's a lot of you. [Renee sighs] [gentle music] It has been quite an end to another great year here at Maria's Meals, and the success of our Christmas dinner meals. I mean, that was all, thanks to you. [people clapping] Here, here. Ah, Jerry, thank you for being a yes to my crazy plan in the first place. - It was worth it. - To all of you, really, for working so hard to make this more than just a pipe dream. I have been in your shoes having to jump when the big boss says jump. More recently than anyone would believe. And I just really need you to know that none of this would happen without you. [gentle music continues] And to Aaron Thompson. [Renee] Who not only designed this incredible recipe, but who reminds me to be grateful every day. You are one of a kind. And I couldn't imagine doing any of this without you. [gentle music continues] To Aaron, a phenomenal chef. Yes, thank you, everyone. Merry Christmas. [all] Merry Christmas. [people clapping] - Hi. - Hey, that was a really, - really great speech. - Oh, thank you. Just one second. -Hey -Hi. - Incredible. Yeah. - Really? Thank you. You came? Yeah. [Jerry] Hey, I owe you a big thank you as well. It's good to see you again, Aaron. We really appreciate everything you did for us. [Aaron] Yeah, well, it's my pleasure. And hopefully we get a chance to do it again If you're still up for that? Absolutely in fact, I was thinking we should bring Aaron on as our full time chef. Yeah, yeah, why not? That's a good idea. You know what? I'll put you in touch with Sam in R&D. She's in charge of new hires while we're away in London. What? Yeah, we did it. We got the six thousand new subscribers. The European expansion is officially a go. Thanks to you. Wow no, that's great, Jerry. But did you just say we'd be in London? Yeah, yeah, that was always the plan, right? You signed off on it. Anyways, this is huge for us. I mean, under ten years? That's amazing. It's incredible, right? Yeah, it is. - Congratulations. - Aaron. I should get going, but... Merry Christmas. - Aaron, wait. - [Jerry] Merry Christmas. Will you hold this, please? - Thank you. - What? [Renee] Aaron, wait! Aaron, please wait. [Renee] Let's just talk about this. [Aaron] What is there to say? These are good things, Renee. I didn't know about London, I swear. And I know that sounds crazy, but you just, you have to believe me. [soft music] You still got to go, right? I don't know. But we will find a way to make it work, okay? I already know how this plays out. You move out there and at first we talk every day. But then once a day turns into once a week and you start feeling guilty about it. And next thing you know, you're asking me for a break. I promise you, I will not let that happen. You can't promise that. Yes, I can this time. I just, I just need to figure out a few details. I need a little more time. That's just it, Renee. You always need more time. Meanwhile, life's just passing by, and I'm... Waiting. I can't do that again. No, don't say that, please. I know what we can be now. We can have it all. Maybe we could have. But it's too late. I'm sorry. Goodbye, Renee. [gentle music continues] [Tasha] We're actually just about to close. Oh, hey, it's you, my long lost friend. Hey, if you need to lock up, I can leave. No, no. Come sit. Is this how you normally like to spend your Christmas Eve? No. I usually watch old Christmas movies with my husband on the couch until I fall asleep. But that's not going to happen this year. I'm guessing that means project have it all was... A fail? Yeah, an epic one. Do you want a slice of pie? How about the whole thing? How about we start with a slice? We'll go from there. Thank you. This one's on me. [plate thuds] Tell me about you. About your Christmas plans. Well, um, normally my husband and I will order Chinese food, and then we go for a walk to look at all the lights. But this year's a bit different, because we actually have a daughter now. [ambient jazz music] You have a daughter? Yeah eight months old and teething like crazy. We're also, uh, we're moving to the burbs in the new year, so. Right. Wow. Yeah, we're, we're super excited to have more space, but I just hope I don't miss the city too much. You won't. Mmm, I'm sure you won't, I mean. It's funny, at a certain point in your life when you've met your person, home becomes less of a place and more of a feeling. It's wherever they are. Exactly. Hey, you're going to find that again someday. Thank you, Tasha. Anytime. I should let you get home. Thank you for the pie. Have a very Merry Christmas. Yeah, you too. [gentle music] [bell jingling] [gentle music] [footsteps clomping] [Renee] I had him. I had him and I didn't appreciate him enough. I know I'm not allowed to make another wish. But I was just hoping. I could send a message to Aaron? My Aaron? What message? Just that I'm sorry for not being a better partner and making him wait while I just sat there afraid. Afraid of what? Afraid of moving on. Afraid of letting go. I'm afraid of failing. I guess it was easier to focus on her problems than move forward towards our dreams. I just want him to know that I love him. [gentle music continues] Tell him yourself. What? How? This was never meant to last forever. What do you mean? You're going home, Renee. What? Tonight at midnight. [gentle music continues] So that means I haven't lost him? [Renee gasps] But my Mom? - No. But why? - I'm sorry. You know why. I wasn't ready to say goodbye. Now you get your chance. [gentle music continues] [Maria] Oh, hi, honey. Sorry I dipped out of the party early. How'd it go with Aaron? It's complicated, but I think there's still hope. You have any more room over there? [couch thumps] [footsteps clomping] What's wrong? Nothing. I just, uh... I wish we had more time. I'm only going to be gone for a few months and we'll talk all the time. Yeah, what if we don't? You know? What if there's bad service or something? Easy. I'll just close my eyes and picture you doing million dollar deals and taking over the world like the boss that you are, in between fancy dinner dates with Aaron. Of course. [both chuckle] And you can picture me next to George Clooney look alike as we sail off into the sunset. [gentle music continues] Then you can send me a hug and I'll send you one back. And we'll both feel it, of course, because... That's love, right? - Sorry. - No, don't be sorry, Renee. I guess I'm having a little bit of trouble with all this change, you know? It's just a lot of change. Yeah, but change is good, honey. Even when it means you have to say goodbye? Even then, goodbyes are a part of life, an important part of life. You can't start again without them. What if I'm not ready? [Maria] Oh, honey, no one's ever really ready. Listen, all I know is that you need to make the most of every moment. And you, my beautiful girl. You have so much good. Left to do in this world. [gentle music continues] You just have to go out. And do it. I'm going to miss you. I'll miss you, too. But I cannot wait to see what you do next. Want to watch a movie? For old time's sake? - Yeah? - Yeah? - Good. - Good. [gentle music continues] I love you, Mom. I love you, baby. [lips smack] I'll picture you sailing. [gentle music continues] [gentle music continues] [alarm beeping] [alarm thuds] [upbeat music] [Renee] Aaron? [soft music] - [Renee sighs] - [gentle music] [upbeat music] [car engine revving] [car door slams] - [bells jingle] - Tasha, good morning. Hey, what are you doing here? You're not scheduled until after Christmas. Let's try this again, shall we? Oh, you didn't have to. Is Jeff here? - Yeah. - [Jeff] Ah, Renee. Good. I need your help to move the filing cabinet. Jeff? Jeff. I just want to thank you for the last five years. You gave me a job on the spot when I moved here, and you are so flexible with me when I needed to take care of my mom. - I appreciate you. - Okay. And I think it's time for me to move on. - It's my resignation. - Oh. I'll help with anything you need. As far as the transition is concerned, I'll train my replacement. You say Renee, I'll be there. I appreciate that. I'll be sad to lose you, Renee. Oh, Jeff. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I'm not going to be sad at all. [Renee] Okay, easy now. [Tasha] I'm so happy for you. Thank you. For everything. - Aaron must be so pumped. - Aaron. - Have you not told him yet? - He was out, so I came here. Go, go, go! Tell him! Get out of here. Oh, wait! I need to buy this immediately, please. Thank you. Why do you need this? That's for you, silly. It's a girl. - Renee? - Yes? You've lost your mind. Nope. Just the opposite, in fact. I love you. Merry Christmas! [uplifting music] [Aaron] Hey, sorry I was gone so long. Had to go to two different hardware stores. The part that I was looking for... [Aaron] Oh, hi. Oh, good morning. Good morning. - You okay? - Yes. I have something for you. - Okay. - [Renee] Open it. Okay, but I have not wrapped your gifts yet. I was going to do it tonight after you fell asleep watching a Christmas movie like always. [soft music] - Renee... - You were right, Aaron. No, I pushed you too far. No. You did not. When mom died, I got stuck. I didn't want to let her go. And I trapped us here. I didn't even realize the years were going by and I had forced us to put our whole life on hold. And you? Wow, you were just waiting. And I'll keep waiting. No, no. It's time. You deserve this. [uplifting music] I've seen it, you know. Our future. Oh yeah? How'd it look? It looked like you cooking delicious meals for me. Thank you so much, by the way. It looked like me learning, how to play hockey. And you laughing at me a lot. Yeah, that checks out. And it looked like us running a business together. Just like you always said. - Really? - Mhmm. And I have a feeling it's all going to work out. But what about the house? We're going to sell it. Are you sure? At the end of the day. It's just a place. I'm ready. For all of it. [soft music] For all of it? But if we have a baby, I need a new car because that clunker is a hazard. And that's what I keep telling you. - Come here. - [bright music] [lips smack] - I love you. - I love you. Do you smell something? [gasps] Oh, no. - [fire alarm beeping] - [bright music continues] - [Renee screams] - Fire, fire! [water running] Okay, I swear, I am going to fix this for you. [curious music] [curious music continues] [curious music continues]
