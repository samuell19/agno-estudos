The car is ready sir I don't know Father! Father! - My child! Go inside! Where did you hide it? Talk! Leave it for God's sake. -Please leave my dad, he doesn't know anything. What's all this? - All this? I swear, I don't know anything about it. -We do not know... You don't know, huh! - Dad! Where is your son Ansari? Where's Ansari? Tell us the names of the people you're with Talk! -Traitor! Biting the hand that fed you huh? We will get you talking at all costs . Speak ... say something! You traitor! Swine! Why aren't you talking? How are you interested in ISI? Put your eyes down. Where did you get the guns? - Talk! Hain! We found all this in Iqbal Ansari's house. This proves that he is an agent of ISI. And it belongs to a terrorist group. In his recent riots, too Perhaps he had a role to play in the riots that broke out recently That's why we arrested him. We have ... many places in Mumbai, have clues proving that these people are in some plans ... He will be tried in a special court. Inspector Karte and his team pick him up and leave Mumbai tomorrow morning. This is not a problem I encountered at the time of my election in Chandangadh. This is a problem facing the nation The police team was attacked by an armed terrorist on the main street. This is the result of our war with the neighboring country Intelligence agency ISI. declared through. First of all, illiterate people are affected And they support ISI. But now even educated people like Ansari have become their agents. This is a dangerous sign. We have to find a solution to this. So the Mumbai police should immediately send a team for Chandangadh, that's what it takes. And from here the terrorist must take Ansari and take him to court. Yes, I know it's not an easy task at all. That is why I add Mr. Naidu ... he knows he has to be very careful when choosing that team so he is sent to Chandangadh. While trying to capture Ansari in Mumbai, 8 police officers have been martyred so far. Nothing has changed. The situation and studies have not changed either. Same danger ... - Have you thought of someone? DCP Anant Srivastav. And we all serve the nation ... The only difference is that we serve the world by wearing Khakee And people, wearing Khakee People want to shut up by applauding him. But she... I know people want to hear much better than me. But due to the limited time Thank you. Now Shri Anant Kumar , the head instructor of this academy, will speak in a few words. Shri Anant Kumar Your father is sleeping. Anant Forgive me for eye splash. In fact, I do not know what I can talk about after the minister's speech ... The year is 1942. I would listen to every conversation between 75 then then I fell asleep. But you can't blame the Speaker .. my fault is to be old now. I am very grateful to the Minister and your friends because they always watched over me. Whenever there is a riot or an incident in my area They immediately transferred me to a deserted place for the sake of peace . My transfers have always continued From one place to another and And when they can't find a place to transfer They appointed me as head instructor for this academy . It was perfect, sir. You were great. - It was a good speech. Well okay. - Thank you. This much praise is enough. We are very lucky ... ... we are our instructors to have you Yes sir. - Real education starts now. And you will have to pass a test at every step . While performing your duties Dirty politics, corruption and In the midst of communalism You will then only have one tutorial This is your conscience, your wisdom Don't let them die. What else can I say? Whatever happens, I wish you success You reach the best places in your career. Yeah? Yes I'm coming. This is another task, this is my wife. My daughter is getting married and I have work to do. Look, I'm waiting for you all to the wedding. Did you just put it here? I want them there too I want lights everywhere. - Well, Madam, all will be done. Two more weeks to the wedding Just two weeks, guests will start arriving in a few days. The gentleman is very angry. Here three Here is a Why are you acting so heavy? I want the house full of flowers. - Miss don't worry Be sure that I will fill the house with fragrant roses. Mom, can you come here please What happened? - The dress is too boring. I can not breathe. - Measured properly, right? I got the measurements right, sir. But she looks like she gained some weight Because she is excited about marriage When was this picture taken? - May 1988. My sister was here for vacation in Banglore. And we went to Mahableshwara. You would even come there. But you could not come due to some circumstances. Which case I was working on and when... you even remember the day, month and the year But I know nothing of what you were doing and when I don't remember half of these photos And I've always been missing from them. These are just pictures. No They're about a whole lifetime Which I've just witnessed... not participated in You have always done your duty, which was very important. I gave my department 30 years. I have always worked properly, I have never complained about these studies. It's all in the past, sir But I don't know why, but today I understand This deal cost me dearly, sit down sir. The department has never seen me as a good police officer. In fact, my wife and daughter have a lot to complain about. My daughter always kidnapped me. His father was never around him. Tomorrow he will leave us all. At least let me see him off. I understand you, Anant. But this is what you've always been waiting for .. don't you feel it's a duty? Anant, this situation is extremely sensitive And I can't trust anyone but you. But sir, there are 12 days to the wedding. -But this is a 3-day affair! You will then return home. But those who were killed in Chandangadh We owe them Anant. We know this is not an easy task. They will do their best For Ansari not to reach Mumbai. Sir, forget the difficulty. We'll take care of that. 71 people died, many were injured Thousands of people were left homeless. They count on me being chosen. They trusted me to be elected. My loved ones - Sir I do not know how to compensate for these. But at least we have to get justice. The whole state trusts you I promise I will never let my uniform (Khakee) be humiliated. It was a high level meeting today. Commissioner Naidu and his minister They chose your husband for this important task. You should be proud of it. Oh yes, I'm proud. Twelve days before our wedding, Mr. DCP. As I understand you're worried that you can't be at the wedding, I won't be at the wedding What nonsense! Police commissioner Anant Kumar Srivastav will attend in my place What? Really? That's what I heard. That I'm surely getting a promotion this time Naidu said. We are not revealing to anyone yet. This can go to the press. Finally, common sense prevailed. You should have been promoted 10 years ago Never mind. It's okay You're happy aren't you? - Yes. After all these years I feel worthy. Good morning sir. Hello, Ashwin - Hello, guys, how are you? - How are you? Hello everyone, how are you? Why is this attitude, inspector. - Not like that, buddy -Come on!

Even on a cross road there is danger. Don't listen to them like a fool. then they come to start eating my brain. - I mean... I said shut up! Cut that bullshit. Why are you screaming at me? You can try to understand me kindly. It's your wife you're talking to You aren't talking to a thief or a thug OK, don't cry. - What do you mean? I've been telling you for a year that I want to see my mother . You say yes, but then you go away on duty I'll be back in three days. We go to your mother together. Promise? - Of course. When I come back, I will buy an embroidered saree for you. Don't tell me - Dad, my stick is broken. - We'll buy a new one. You are my only Sachin Tendulkar. Nice to see him awake. Another time when I come he is always asleep. It's as if he grew up in his covers. You can't say it's his fault? You go away for days on end. That's how your duty is Don't make fun of me. - Don't make fun of me Wait, let's go Officer, why are you sitting here? Get down. Why are you so angry lady? Many events happen around here today. That is why the government made such a decision to ensure the safety of the ladies. We will go to a picnic after tomorrow. Are you coming No man, I'm in a mess.

Are you playing games by hiding from me. Where did you hide it? Where did you hide it? Tell me quickly! What? - Cocaine, drugs! You quit smuggling. You're dealing drugs now, aren't you? I have confirmed information this time. No, sir, whichever enemy is my enemy has given you false information. And you are always looking for my home. Do not lie! I couldn't sleep properly all night because of you. I'm telling the truth, I'm not doing any illegal business, sir. Why don't you ask her? Talk. She has said and done all she had to Now all the work is up to you. Otherwise you will be locked up for 10 years What are you giving me? - Get the full amount. Stay alert Don't lie to your wife, I can raid your house anytime Never come back early. Do you understand? Enjoy. No, no ... Am I crazy enough to go to Chandangadh? But sir, we have an important job. - Is this job more important than my life? Don't you know what happened in Chandangadh to the 8 police officers What happened to them? They were killed on the way. They collided there. Fortunately I have political connections I will avoid going there. Listen to me. Find some excuse. Get out of it. Sorry sir I can't do that - Is that so? Tell me something. Why did you become a cop? Come on, tell me. Sir, I've had a dream since I was a kid Enough, I know this story. Your father was a freedom fighter, your mother was a school teacher. I'm tired of listening to such films stories Tell me the truth. Did your family force you? Or are you working to earn some extra money? Am I right? - If any person tries to bribe me I'll break his jaw - Bravo! Everyone says the same thing in the beginning. But then they wreck the one who doesn't bribe Stop the car sir Stop the car DCP ordered us to be at the Police station tomorrow at 9 am. Goodnight - Goodnight This is fine. This is not good. There is a problem with the handle. This works, sir. - Sir, do we have an insurance policy? So if they don't work properly we're done. Forget it. Why should the minister leave early in the morning to serve the world? We contracted him last night. He told me to call that morning. Please connect the phone, please. I only have 4 bulletproof jackets. The rest is gone. What? Is he busy with prayer? My life is about to end. Tell me it's an emergency. - We only have 4 bulletproof jackets. That's enough for you lot. - Sir, aren't you coming? I will come to present flowers to your grave. Mr Patil, Shekhar here. - Shekhar? Who? Your inspector Shekhar. - Talk How are you? - I'm fine. How is your sister and grandmother? - Come to the reason. Sir, I told you about Chandangadh last night. Take me off the list. - No, that's impossible. - Find a way, please. I told you it's not possible, you don't understand Your wife called me last night. He talked about Shahrukh Khan's new movie premiere She wants her children photographed. - Pandya will take them. Okay, sir, please say my greetings to your wife Okay. -And tell the kids I'm not available and convey my regards to grandma. I am closing now. - Yes, sir. Bloody swine. Good morning Sir - Good morning guys. Is everything ready? - We have everything that tops the list. Does anyone have a personal weapon on them? I was making some adjustments. I have no more weapons. How many bullets do you have? - Thirty. Keep them with you. All guns checked? Mr. Gupte made a very thorough check. He wins a gold medal in this shot. Cardboard target - Did you say something? - Actually, sir on the shooting range It is very easy to shoot at the target. Because the target never responds to you. And a person can do that. - Yes. Anyway We will go out to Chandangadh at 11:30. And if everything goes as planned and goes well We return with Ansari the next morning But we must act cautiously Under the law, stay alert. Follow the rules. The enemy we face has neither a name nor an identity. How many of them there are, we don't know. But we know they are too much. We do not know their weapons. But we know they have bigger guns than us. We do not know when, where or how they will hit us. But they will definitely hit us. We know that. They will do anything to rescue Ansari. So be careful. Any questions? Beautiful. We will be leaving in 10 minutes. Good luck guys. A lot of bets. What do you think? What are our chances? 100%. - To come back? No no. To go to heaven. There is a photographer outside the compound. Get him. Hey, let's go Where are you taking me? Sir I'm a freelancer, here is my card. I earn 200, 250 dollars per photo And I am making a living. I knew a special team was going to Chandangadh I thought I could earn a few extra dollars What are you doing, sir? Sir, this is my livelihood. I will not handle this error again Please sir Don't pick up. My wife didn't say she you are here. I've already sent the photo packs. I have nothing else. So how did this get here then? This was made for a test. I don't know how I forgot this? My mistake. I am eliminating this mistake. But what do we do with the second mistake? - Second mistake? Police The ones you brought along, they are waiting for you outside. I'll take care of them, I'll handle them Don't get tensed. Now your silence is the only solution for me not to get tensed. You mean... You will... No... look, you can't do this. We have been good friends for a long time. My wife thinks of you like her brother. You can't kill me. Please forgive me. I will not make this error again in the future. I'm ready to do whatever you say. If you want, I can leave this city. Look, I have a wife A daughter They have nobody but me My daughter will be orphaned Don't kill me, please don't kill me. What can you do for your family? I can do anything... anything. Can you betray me too? No... I didn't mean to say that. I would never do such a thing. This family thing is very strange. Sometimes you turn from a human to a monster And sometimes you turn from a monster to a human. You're lucky. You won. - When did you arrive, brother? - Just now What's wrong with him? - He's a little emotional. He loves his people very much. - It's okay, but What does his father's baby want to be? She wants to be a singer. She loves to sing. Sing. - Sing a song for your uncle Life can change at any time Sometimes there are shadows Sometimes life is sunny Let's go see it. Super. I'm going now. Have something to eat before brother goes. Another day. Thank you. - What's wrong with you? Why are you crying? Why are you so worried? Nothing. Who is this? - Police Open up. - Police? Here? Don't be afraid. I'll take care of them. Open the door. Answer the phone, Shweta. - All right, Mom. Live this moment to the fullest As soon as tomorrow Dr. Iqbal Ansari Because of some selfish people like you the whole society was slandered. But you don't care. Because you are selfish ... you would even sell your mother for your own benefit I have been informed you haven't broke your silence yet You didn't speak to anyone. We are not here to talk or listen to you either We are here to take you to Mumbai court And we'll definitely get you there. In an attempt to save you your terrorist friends killed 8 policemen I have to settle that score too We are not here to kill anyone. Now listen, Ansari, look There are two kinds of justice One, justice is provided in court. DCP Sir just explained this to you. And second, it happens outside of court. It suits me And to me, this method will be more suitable for people like you Remember If you try to make a smart move as we leave town, you'll remember Without any court or lawyer, judge Just one bullet and then case dismissed. I put the bullet in your head, it comes out on the other side. Do you understand? Hey junior did you see how I threatened him Was that a display of courage? He's a cardboard target. He couldn't fight back Good good! It's settled between us. Riots Ansari, his silence and attacks This is not a good sign, Mr. Shrivastav. If he leaves that place as soon as possible, we can achieve peace. My best wishes with you. - You wish me luck? Or are you giving bad news? He's looking for a lady named Mahalakshmi. She called from Little Angels School. She suspects that people staying in her place are terrorists. Little Angel school ... Thembi Naka Tell her not to leave the phone booth and wait for the police. Tell her not to speak to anyone. - Yes sir. Sir, if you don't mind can we go with the team? - Of course. Yes sir. - The photographer you wanted to watch Someone killed him and his family. There was an explosion at their house. Even 4 policemen were killed. Did Ansari say anything suspicious? Any leads? We have fresh information about a terrorist hangout We're about to go there sir Look, I can walk. I can even run. We can't leave you, Darky. Thank you sir. You cannot continue with us either. I'll assist you, sir You are exhausted, you are weak You are not healthy. You need to rest, not work. Do you have petrol? You seem quite relaxed. You aren't wearing your bulletproof jacket? Mahalakshmi had called Damn Mahalakshmi! From the name she's a 75-year-old witch Born in 1936, she was bored watching TV She thinks of making a name in the neighbourhood she called the police so she can get herself on TV Sir, how can you be so sure? - We cops have an instinct Not every cop has this. I have it by the grace of God. I have a very strong instinct. I can never go wrong, watch Those in uniform stay here. Those in civilian clothes will come with me. Like we always do. Let's go. I told you. Excuse me Sorry, did you call us? - Yes, I called. Fantastic. Were you born in 1936? - You are right, how do you know? Where are they? - At home. They are crying. Cry? Why are they crying? - I told them you are coming. Why did you tell them? To calm them down. They are waiting for you. - Waiting for policemen? You chaps are policemen? - What did you think? Are you not cable guys? Cable guys? - My grandsons were watching a TV match and the tv suddenly went off. So I called the technicians. I'm waiting for them. Aren't you Mahalakshmi? -I am Sapna Sir, your instinct has failed. That one passed. Those blue eyes will kill me. Miss you tell me - Wait a minute, wait You can tell me. Inspector Shekhar Verma. I am above him. Yeah? His senior has arrived, DCP sir. Talk to him. Are you sure nobody has left yet No. I was watching from the shop, nobody came out. Which room? That one What is going on here? There is going to be shooting? Yes, it's possible. Tell the staff to lock the kids inside. Nobody should go out until I say. Sawant - Yes sir? Come on children. The cap is hot, sir. - He must have just escaped. Tell them to block all roads. - Yes sir. Even his mother won't recognise him Face smashed at point blank, and the gun is shoved inside. Sir, they burned his hand, no fingerprint chance. No! I will answer all your questions at the police station But first clean this corpse. Lady, why are you screaming We didn't put the body here. They have been staying as your guests for 10 days. Look, the trustees rented the room out How were they to know that they were terrorists? They said they were here to make a documentary on the riots They were honest criminals They kept their promise to make movies. They shot, and then disappeared. You think this is funny? Is this some kind of joke for you? She's angry. Give the lady a cold drink. - Just one second, ma'am. What made you inform us today out of all days? Because of this. A bullet. One of my children was playing with this today That is the reason I called today. Ok? Look, ma'am, this is very important. Is it possible for you to recognise these people? I'm telling the truth, I haven't seen everyone but I can recognize one or two of them But Today The man who came in the morning His face I can never forget. Miss I don't think you are safe here anymore We must ensure her safety. Talk to SP Wagh and ask him to send security outside her house . Look, I'm not staying here. I'm going home to Mumbai I have only been here for 3 months to do a workshop with the children. Look, as a responsible citizen I fulfilled my duty and called you here. Now it's your turn to do your duty. Why are you getting me involved? I don't want your security, damn it! - You may not want it. But you need it. Look madam, the man you came face to face with today... will not forget your face. He's a very dangerous man. He never leaves a clue behind. As you can see with the corpse. Sir, we're leaving for Mumbai tomorrow, why can't we... Sir, good thinking. Ashwin's right. - One minute, one minute I have to talk to the Center. We cannot take her with us as a procedure . What's the guarantee that I'll be safer with you lot? They were here for ten days, and nothing unwanted happened. I made one phone call I didn't say anything to anyone. And suddenly they ran away. This is shocking. Don't trust anyone Anant. Do what you think is right. Sir, I want to change my travel plans. - If you think it's right, do it. Right, sir. What should we do with this girl Mahalakshmi? As you said, her life may be in danger. Take her with you. This can be useful in court. - Right, sir. Yes sir. Why do you want to change your travel plan? All arrangements have been made. Yes, arrangements have been made. Tickets are reserved for tomorrow morning at Mumbai Express. Cabin no. S1. seat no. From 24 to 29 How do you know? The tickets are in my drawer. I only know about them. Other people knew these details. I found this piece of paper next to the body. Under this piece of paper the details are written on paper like an article. The storm is about to come from somewhere. Sir. Wait a minute sir She's Ansari's mother, sir He ain't talking to nobody, and this old witch-looking woman doesn't want to understand She's been waiting here for a long time. And she insists on talking to you today. Wait a minute, sir. A minute - She's going to scratch your brain. I'll shoo her away. - Wait. Open the door. Sir. Ansari's son. I am an illiterate woman. I don't know what's going on here. But everyone says my son is a traitor. He was responsible for the blood spilled here. If this is true then I would be ashamed. Because I gave birth to such a child. But a mother's heart says that's not possible, he is innocent. The court will make the best decision. If he is a criminal, send him to the gallows. But for heaven's sake take him to court at all costs Don't hit him on the road. You will see your son in court. What are you doing? Staying close to doors and windows is dangerous in this situation. That way, you can be an easy target. Excuse me. Did you get hurt? - No problem. I was a little rude to you in the morning during questioning. No problem. -I'm a little clumsy when it comes to a girl. Shy, angry ... always like this. Why not take a medicine for cough? You were saying something, Miss Mahalakshmi. No. You were saying something. Look, I don't know what happens to me when I run into a girl? I really don't understand. How strange. You're a cop, but - A beautiful girl like you that surprises me... He runs a major social service in a small city like Chandangadh. I'm really a fan. I have loved social work since childhood. But then I saw violence, politics and… I hate it. I feel like I want to drop everything and be with you. Mhatre! Why don't you take medicine for the cough? Yeah, you were saying something? - No This time you were talking. Again... These are the good drivers of the city. They know the city of Mumbai very well. This one ... - Ghorpade, you will go with them. Yes, DCP is here. Tell me your name. Who is it, Ashwin? - Someone wants to talk to you. He says he's your old friend. But he doesn't say his name. Hello ... - Welcome, welcome to Chandangadh. Who? - When you come to my house I wasn't there... ... sorry that I could not afford it. I tried to talk when you were there. I had the phone ring, but you did not pick it up. You're still sharp, Mr. DCP. A hunter enjoys when he has a smart and sharp victim. Who is the hunter and who is the victim ... We will see soon The call cannot be traced. - I can hear the sound of a train -Why did you keep quiet my friend? Are you trying to remember something? You speak like you know me You may have forgotten your old friends, Mr. DCP. But I'll never forget Sir, all the stations' lines have been cut. -In a bar or a restaurant near the station... I can hear it. I do not forget orforgive. All bars and restaurants in the city are closed. Because of night curfew Sarika, look who came. - A minute I am working. You can look if you want. Who are you? Who are you looking for? - He's inside my house. My house - I can reach everywhere DCP sir. I can even reach Ansari. You are lucky today. You are not defeated You can't always be lucky. And I only give a chance once. Hello, hello ... if you do something to my wife and daughter Good night. Damn it! Come on, pick up the phone. Hello Jaya! - Yes Anant? Anant? Speak Is everything okay? - Yes, why? Where's Sarika? - He is here. Hi father! What is the problem? - Nothing I just missed you. The constables are outside? - Yes. - Ok Anant, you sound anxious? It's alright, you sleep. See you soon. Bye. I feel better. - What do you mean? Whenever I run out of danger, I feel good I am always on the lookout for such dangers. Where there is danger, there is Shekhar. There is Shekhar, where there is danger, Now for example this Chandangadh mission As soon as I learned about this duty, I went to the commissioner. I told the commissioner to take it if the task was dangerous He told me we had to choose a group leader first I said, sir, go ahead. I'm with you too. But first say that you will get me because this is a dangerous mission. And Shekhar is leaving. You know the politics of the cops. Right? But I didn't want to take any risks. I called the minister and told him to speak to the commissioner. He persuaded him to include me in this mission, because Shekhar was honest ... Shekhar is -Brave. Right. Shekhar is - Brilliant Shekhar is a good boy. This mission is not possible without Shekhar. Listen to me. Do you know where they want to send me? To escort his children to the premiere of Shah Rukh Khan movie. Now is this a job for brave people like us to do. A hot tea Hey traitor, Iqbal bhai Have some food, you will starve. We already have a bad reputation. If you die They make us miserable. Why are you bothering me? Eat... Why are you bothering him? - He doesn't eat at all. He will eat when he is hungry. Hey you want something to eat? He doesn't want to eat. Do you want something to drink? No. When he feels hungry, he will want to eat. Sir ordered me to definitely feed him. - Sir said? - Yes. Look bhai, sir wants you to eat something. Traitor, can't you digest our food ? Say to sir that he ate what he can. He will not feel hungry until evening. Give it to me. Yes Jaya I made all the arrangements for the purchase I talked to caterers. Nothing will be missing. The florist will come and show you the catalogs. Choose the ones that best fit the budget. I will buy a gift for the groom. Do not worry. Tell Sarika. I'll buy her a big watch. A minute. Which brand's product is this? Panera sir. Made in Germany. - I'll buy her a German brand Panera watch. What is the cost? - 5,000 sir Ask him to show us half a dozen of those watches... No sir, not 5,000 rupees. But 5000 dollars. Jaya, listen Let's buy him an Indian watch as a gift Yeah, we'll talk to you later Someone gave it me as a gift Did I ask him anything? Mahalakshmi, get up. Mahalaxshmi, wake up. If you are sitting next to a driver, no sleep, your eyes will be driving... otherwise I will feel sleepy. Talk to me - You're the one who talks all day. Go on You're teasing, huh, okay. So tell me where the name Mahalakshmi comes from? My family put it. Is there any problem? No. No problem. When I'm talking to you, I feel like I'm talking to a building. What? - Oh yes! True. Many of the Mumbai buildings have your name. Mahalakshmi apartments, Mahalakshmi apartments, Mahalakshmi rooms Mahalakshmi Communities, Mahalakshmi station, Mahalakshmi race stadium And Mahalakshmi lottery I often buy lottery tickets But the jackpot has hit today. Shooting -Shooting? Where? I'm talking about a movie shoot. Don't hug the guns immediately. If it resembles only those movies in our life. That would be fun. How so fun? - That would be great fun. One person sings cheerfully and everything in it poured out. It's fun! Do you know how to dance? God, those blue eyes will kill me!

Who asked you? Thank God, nothing undesirable happened But why didn't it happen? He's not that stupid, risking his life running away after showing his face He was here to do something But why didn't he do it? Or did he run away after doing something? I was on top of the van I did not let anyone come close to it. Now the question is this jeep Who was standing next to the jeep? Get out! Reverse! Back! Back! Reverse! Let's go! Boys, are you okay? They must be civilians, they may be scared when they saw it. Or did they come to see who died and who survived? There is a problem, sir The van does not start. Our van broke down. - What should I do? We want to stay here for a while. -Mr D'Mello is not at home. I'll talk to Mr D'Mello. Just a few hours. The master won't agree. - I just said a few hours. Our master will not say anything. Isn't he the agent from Pakistan? I saw him on TV at my home -Who else is in the house? - Ramdas Uncle and me Nandan, I'm the cook. I have no signal here. What about you? -There is no network here, sir. Yes, but our phone works. Please sit down. I'll get some water. Kamlesh - Yes, sir? - Take the Ansari inside and stay by him. Come on ... - Ghorpade, fix the van. - Shekhar, Ashwin and Mhatre. Block all entrances and exits of this house. Yes, sir. Sir. Who? Sir, this is Anant speaking. Our jeep was attacked. There was an explosion. No casualties. But we need help. Tell me exactly where you are. I will immediately send the police team. Sir, it's the house on the dusty road along the Pirbar Road.. OK. Listen, don't move. Do not move. - Yes sir. Thank you sir, thank you Who will pay for the call? Why are you asking my master for money? How much? I'll pay you. Yes sir. How much? - 30 rupees. Don't you have any money in your pockets? Do you get everything for free? I will pay it. - I'll pay you later. Don't forget to take your money. These people never give anything just to raise money - get lost. Come, Miss Mahalakshmi, don't be afraid. - I'm not afraid. -You can find everything here. - A mouse, a scorpion or a snake. -I am not afraid of them. No problem. Aren't you afraid of these too? - No. Aren't you afraid of anything? I was scared when I was a kid. - Of what? When I wouldn't sleep, my mother used to say "Go to sleep, my child..." "else the police will arrive" - You've made bandits out of the cops Know what? There could be ghosts here, even spirits of the buffaloes Ghosts? - But no need to be afraid. I am here. Where is the danger, Shekhar is here. Sit here ... All night I'll stay with you and protect you. Do not worry. To hell with the ghost. Do you know what? Take this blanket and go to sleep. Sleep ... -I'm fine. Do not worry about me. -What are you saying? A ghost can do anything! - What can a ghost do? - God! Hey uncle are you scaring a cop? - There is no light Are there any ghosts here? - Yes, 18 of them. Have you heard? 18 ghosts... have you heard? What will you do now? 18? How exciting! Actually, I've heard a lot about ghosts, but haven't seen one. But the ghost will not come here when a brave man like you is with me. Go now and give me this experience! Goodnight! Listen to me, Mahalakshmi ... Listen to me! At least give me the torch! How am I going down? It's too dark Hey Uncle! At least take me with you! Sir, tea You may have forgotten your old friend, Mr. DCP. But I do not forget. I also do not forget. I also do not forgive. Good afternoon. What is this, inspector? These are 5 thieves who were involved in the bank robbery 3 days ago I've found that they are hiding here. I said surrender they opened fire. They dared to shoot a police officer. I shot in self-defense and those poor people died. What could I do? Don't try to be smart, Aangre I know very well the guys who robbed the bank I can see everything clearly. For money You killed these innocent people. Thus, the case can be closed But you can't make me believe this story I was thinking the same thing. Something is wrong in the story. Four of them lie there. One lies here. But not a single cop dies to their firing? At least one police officer have to die and if it's a senior officer, then it'll breathe life to the story You will regret it. You will regret it very much! Hello Yes, Mr D'Mello. I had called. Actually... Hello? Hello? How did it get disconnected? Call everyone. We're leaving. - Sir Stand back! Oh God! What does it say? Send Ansari out, else we'll go inside. Ashwin, how many bullets do you have? - Three. Seven, sir. - Mhatre? Two, sir. I only have one. This was a nice move by the enemy. They make us waste our bullets And then negotiate with us. How many bullets do you have, Shekhar? Shekhar! Shekhar, what are you doing? - I'm throwing this dog out! Are you mad? We cannot let him go. -We can't keep him with us. - I called Mr. Naidu... The police team is almost here. When will the police team arrive? After we're all dead? To write a report? To count and collect our corpses? What are we gonna do? Should we all die here with this hope? We will fight, Shekhar. - How are we going to fight? How? We've seen how many bullets they have, how many do we have? Seven, three, two ... One? Sir, let's let him go If he lives, we can catch him again in the future. They left us no other choice. We don't have any chance. We will all die for no reason. If you're so afraid of death, why did you wear this uniform? Do you know what this uniform (Khakee) means? Your mission is more important than your life. Did you understand! - Yes, I understand. I understand you, old man. You're a failed cop. An unsuccessful cop! I admit that you have not accepted bribes for your whole life! But you did nothing! You have always been a permanent buyer in the department all your life. You have gone mad, oldie! If you die for your duty, you will be a martyr, you will be famous your family will receive a medal. But we cannot die for your selfish motive. Get out of my way! Move! I am alive and responsible for this mission until I die. He's not going anywhere. This is my command. To hell with your command. To hell with the duty. And to hell with you I knew you were a corrupt cop . But today I also witnessed your cowardice. Fool! I'm fighting for everyone. The problem is not your life or my life Now the question is what my conscience says. And my conscience says DCP is right. Put your revolver down. - Are you going to shoot me? Are you going to shoot me for this ISI agent ? Because of this traitor... - Kill me! Finish me! Do you think these people are here to rescue me? No. They want to kill me. Yeah. I've been hearing taunts for a long time Traitor, ISI agent Pakistani? I am paying the price of being an Indian. I am paying the price of being an honest Indian. I can not act against the rules. Autopsy is required for these three corpses I can no longer give death certificates. Why is that? RMO is angry. -They didn't die in the riots. They were poisoned and the wounds were later made by torture. Your job could be in jeopardy, doctor - I'm sorry. Even if my job is at risk. I will not issue false death certificates. Listen Doctor I'm Bhaskar Joshi. I am a freelance journalist The reports of the corpses - I can't say anything about that. This is a policing situation. - Even the police are involved, sir. And a very influential person is behind all these events. Devdhar? - Yes, our minister, Devdhar. Now he is fighting for peace. But he's behind these riots. Why is that? - There could be many reasons. God knows what crimes he committed for the sake of that power Three social workers Ashish Garg, Narayan Rane and Vaishali Shinde gathered evidence of what he did against him. So he could be caught. But Devdhar knew everything about it. He's on the pretext of a meeting by searching for them, poisoned them and punished them by inflicting wounds on their dead bodies. and threw the bodies into the area where the riots started. So everyone thought they died in the riots. What can I do? I have a file containing Devdhar's evils If you give me autopsy reports of three bodies I print them in newspapers with evidence Here are the reports. And if I learn more information I will let you know. Here is my card. Read tomorrow's newspapers. You haven't eaten anything since last night. There was a card in my pants pocket yesterday . Can you give that card? You would have eaten something first. - Come on, brother. - Someone with such great love to me would I eat it if it offered poison? - Shut up You came home late again last night, you know the state of this country. - Nothing happens in our neighborhood. People here are very nice. - Every person is a beautiful person. Whether a Hindu or a Muslim. Everyone wants to live in peace. But these politicians - Iqbal Yeah, mom? What's the matter, son? Your wife said she was worried since last night Nothing. - Don't worry, I'm going to pray. I will pray for peace. Even Zafar wants to visit the shrine. Its holiday today, too. I thought too ... -No, not Zafar. Please, dad! Please! - No no Please! - Ok But you won't bother your grandmother. - I'll bother her a little Naughty boy. Would you drop us off on the train at 5 o'clock? Mom, I'll drop you on my way to the hospital . Mom, get some tea. Bhaskar, you said you would write everything about Devdhar in newspapers today with my reports. Nothing was written. Who is it? - I'm Doctor Iqbal Ansari. Hey smart man What do you know about Devdhar? What did the reporter say to you? You don't know me yet. Don't worry, he's fine. Hello sir, I am Jayanti from Bhatia Aaj Tak. We want to ask about the riots ... Talk to the RMO Please sir Bhaskar? Bhaskar? What happened? Get the operating room ready, fast! What happened? What? What? Bhaskar! Sir, the phone call is for you Hey smart man! What did Bhaskar tell you before you died? Tell me everything. Where is the file? You guys killed Bhaskar! - Forget him, he's dead. Think about who's alive. Things aren't good for humans these days. Did you understand? Hey! Stop the nonsense! I don't have any file either. Even if I had it I wouldn't give it to you. People like Devdhar deserve to be hanged in the street square. You should be ashamed, doctor! Everyone is slandered for dishonest people like you - What the hell is this? -Go and check your house. Weapons and ammunition were found in your house... What? - Yes, go and see! The rebels burned your house Go! Father! Father! Farida! Have you seen my dad?! Has anyone seen my family? Has my family come here? Why doesn't anyone talk?! Talk! Hey smarty We can save your life. Tell us where the file is Did you see? We filled an empty box with ammunition and burned your house. Why have you been silent for so long? - What should I have said? To whom should I have said all this? To the police? The ones who put firearms in my house and then held me responsible. Or to the press? Who stamped me a terrorist without even asking the truth Who should I have told? I can't change what will happen now. I will definitely die If you people want to save your lives, you can leave me here. Because you were not sent here to take me, you were sent here to die with me. Shekhar, take Ansari! Move! Good evening. Sorry I think I came at the wrong time. What can I do? These things happen. Why are you amazed, Mr. DCP? I am doing this job for the government you work for. The only difference is that you get a check every month. I get cash and get paid a little more than you. Politics is very strange. They sent you in to stop me and me to shoot you. Where's Doctor Ansari? Smarty Shekhar is missing, and that little one Ashwin is missing too. Would you like to play? Let's go. Natwar, find the rascals! Mahalakshmi do you want to check me out? Leave me alone. What have I done? What have I done? - Shut him up, Mack. Leave him. You are always ready to die, DCP. You have a very beautiful wife and a very beautiful daughter. But they're unfortunate as well, you've never been with them. You spent your life thinking about the khakee So I'll take care of your wife and daughter after you! Mac put the gun to his temple. If DCP moves, riddle everyone with bullets Slap your sir. No I.. No.. I'll blow your sir's head off. No.. I.. no.. Kalwa? - Yes, sir? Did you hear that? - No, sir. Did you hear when he slapped me? - Yes sir. He should hear it. Kalwa - Heard, sir. Kill me. Kill me, sir. Later. First, your sir's head will be blown off No no. Sir don't do it Sir don't do it. I understand, Mac! No sir. This is called true slap. It hurts both the hunter and the victim You slapped me here right on the skin But I attacked your soul. This is called true slap. For what you've done to me I would kill you the moment I got out of jail. But your life doesn't mean anything to you, I know. Duty, honor and self-respect That's what matters in your life. I'll take all of it away slowly I have the opportunity today. You will fail this mission. They'll strip your uniform. People will spit in your face. Only then will there be peace for me. Your ideas hardly matter Only the tempest will decide the fate of the light The lamp that has the gas will stay lit Sir ... There's some people hiding in the storehouse Come on, gold medalist, let's see your success. Come on! Get out! Move! Move! Move! Ansari! Sir, I can't stop the bleeding. We must definitely take him to the hospital. Shekhar to the hospital. Fast! Quickly. Did Ansari say anything? We have some clues about terrorists How did they know that you were coming? I want to change my travel plans. Hello - Where are you, Anant? I sent the police team there. Where are you? How is Ansari? Was he shot? Ansari is shot How do you know? Actually, Anant - Only we knew that. And Aangre. Ansari is still alive. We will definitely take him to court. Tell this to your father! Devdhar! I got the bullet out. However, the health of the patient is critical. He may need to be observed here for a few days . Right sir. You people can go back. This mission is over for you. The truth is very different from what we know. Those who sent us for this task do not want us to be successful. Ansari must be brought to court. And still if we keep fighting, We will fight the Government. We have to find the whole system. In this case it will be nearly impossible to bring Ansari to court. Besides, let's say we managed to get him to court The government will definitely take revenge on us. We will get suspended. They will throw us on fire. They will even throw us behind bars. I decided to fight to the end . You people are still too young. Your lives lie before you. You can go back. Very good, sir. Very good. You want to do all the good things alone. Very good sir. Ok, I have been a bad cop. Fine, I've done a lot of bad deeds. But now this is a great opportunity to get rid of my sins. And you want to snatch it from me? I'm not returning. Last night I was rude to you please forgive me. But please, sir, I'm not going back. I will come with you too. Take me with you or else I will follow you till the end. But sir, I will definitely come. I will come with you until the end. I'm with you too sir, I don't care if they fire me. I'm with you too, sir Once we are finished with this mission I am going to resign I am also with you too, sir. Ok. We will cut contact with Mumbai from now on. No phone calls, no cell phone, nothing. What are you up to, my friend? You're thinking of quitting. A person like me should quit. But look at me This is a new beginning for me. And you say you will resign Why are you going to resign? Why? Why should I do this job? I learned this during this mission the reason why I joined the police force. I am not allowed to do. And what they want me to do, my conscience does not accept it. Then why? To please criminals like Devdhar and Naidu? Whatever happens -Did I wear this uniform to confirm to this order to serve them? No sir. Tell me a good reason why should I wear this uniform? Sir SP sir is here. Sorry I had to inform. You have to come with me to the police station. Tell the minister and the commissioner whatever you want to say We have the order to detain Ansari and the whole team. We are just doing our duty. What is your duty? Can you tell us? What is our mission? Protect good people Destroy criminals, that's our motto, isn't that what's written on the back? This is our goal. Protect good people. Destroy criminals. But What are we doing? For the sake of money and success We will lick the feet of politicians like Devdhar. Doctor Ansari was doing his duty in Chandangarh This crook Devdhar turned his life upside down. Inspector Fateh was doing his duty. And Ghorpade. The police officers killed in Chandangadh were doing their duty. For this mission, we have been fighting death for 48 hours. And our department are set to trample all over us. This bastard Devdhar has been constantly raping the law Because our officer Naidu has become his pimp Damn it! Let alone the criminals If the police department so wishes, and Governments allow No one can grab a toy from a child in the city. But actually why did we become cops I know why we wore this uniform Spreading savagery to desperate and weak people. That's all. A municipal worker is a better person than us. They wear khakee like us, but by going in the groove cleans the mess of the city. Mr Satam Our duty is to get Ansari to the court. ... and giving him justice. We will definitely do that And if you say your duty is to stop us then you can shoot us. OK? So... Pull that bloody gun out of your holster and shoot. Because we're taking him out of here Hello Sir, Additional Commissioner Naidu is on phone Hello? Satam is speaking. I went to the hospital, sir. We brought them to the police station. - Don't let them go. - Yes sir. - Listen to me carefully. This is a matter of prestige for us. This is an order of the ministry. -We brought them to interrogation. But they are not who we are looking for. We will inform you if there is news as soon as possible. Thank you for reminding me of what my mission is. You can stay here until Doctor Ansari is rescued. What are you doing here, Shekhar? What do you think? What can I think of, Mahalaxmi? What I was thinking was wrong. Everything I did was wrong. What I understood was wrong. I don't know anything about my family. I've never seen them. Nobody thought of me. I've always thought of myself. I could never become a good human being ... nor could I be a good cop - Don't say such things, Shekhar. Today, we are all alive thanks to you. Thanks to you, we escaped the explosion, we managed to get out of that house thanks to you. This is not the case. I was not even well-intentioned for you So now? Now I want to be a good person, like DCP I know there are many difficulties on this road But I will definitely walk down this road. I'm with you, Shekhar. Promise? Promise Have you seen them here? - No, sir. Is there any news? - Aangre is busy finding them. And the police are looking for them everywhere. -You are responsible for all this, Naidu! You! With your help, I had weapons found in Ansari's house. You also got him arrested. But you couldn't do anything to that stupid man, You couldn't find the file! And you don't say a word. Do you know why that silent? Because he no longer trusts the police. And he wants to rip me apart in court. Now he has run away. - I told you to kill him in Chandangadh over there. But you refused. First, you asked for the file. In case it fell into someone else's hands. Do not worry. We will find Ansari Naidu, how did you get here? I took the elevator. But I went up the stairs. I climbed the crime ladder to reach this place . I reached here by walking over the corpses . I even crushed my loved ones and reached here. These sins of mine are in that file. If it gets into the hands of the media I will be the minister in a few months No never! I do not want to lose this game I put my life and everything on a bet. Ansari should not be able to reach the court. And I should have that file. Sir, the media are here they want to talk about the Ansari case. Tell them we have nothing to say. - We do We're coming right now .. tell them. What you and Aangre couldn't do, the public will now do it. Minister accuses Anant Srivastav and his team During the riots in Chandangadh, Mumbai, Dr Ansari went missing. There are suspicions that the police team have also joined the ISI organisation . And they kidnapped Ansari for money. DCP Anant Shrivastav and his team are composed of: Senior Inspector Shekar Verma, Sub Inspector Ashwin Gupte, Chief Constable Kamlesh Sawant and Constable Gajanan Mhatre. If you get any news about them inform the nearest police station. Ansari! What are you doing? Why do you want to save me? Let me die! You have to live, Ansari! You have to! - Why? For whom? Many things have happened to me. Should I live to see the downfall of myson and mother's lives? I have no reason to live. Look, whatever happens, Ansari we cannot change your destiny. But at least we can try to save the lives of others. Together we can try to ensure that any other Ansari doesn't go through the same that you did You have to be with us. You have to come to court with us. So we can fight for justice. Sir Satam called. He said that the news is saying that we are united with ISI. And we disappeared with Ansari. Sir, people are attacking with swords and sticks. We can go through the back door sir No, we'll go through the front door. Come on. What are you guys looking at? Kill Ansari. Hey! Who said that? Who said that? You? Did you say that? Will you kill him with a sword? Come, kill Ansari, come Kill him! Kill him! Why aren't you killing him? Hit me. Come on. Hit me! Get lost! Who else wants to kill Ansari? Talk! Talk! Show me your face! Bloody vultures! You attack like vultures. Why can't you look me in the eye? It takes courage to hit someone in the eye . And only an honest person will dare to do so. Ansari is a traitor. He must be punished. Will you punish him? Are you a cop or a judge executioner, who gave you the right to do this? If he is guilty, he will be punished by the court! We are taking him to court! How you gonna take him to court after selling your conscience I pity people like you. Every time, all the time, you are led astray You are used! They make you burn your own houses with your own hands... while they watch in glee, and yet you refuse to see the truth? This is what happens today. Without knowing the truth, you'll spill out on the roads And you're ready with the sword. Look, we know what the truth is, our blood was shed because we knew the truth. We fought with the death. If you think I'm not telling the truth and fighting to death stand out and stop us. Otherwise, get out of the way. Satam has called. Normally, no train stops at this station during the day. But since it is a special service, a train will pass for you here. Until the galleon, then it will be your job. Yeah. Thank you. - Well, sir. Yes dad. I'll get there soon We were warned not to call anyone. You are the police, your family members can understand this. But my father doesn't understand all this. He heard my voice and took a sigh of relief You didn't tell him where we are right? Inspector Shekhar Varma, after I started staying with the cops I started thinking smart. I know what to say and not to say. But of course we talked about you. About me? What did you say? Just a handsome and dashing police officer will take me home And one day he'll take me out of the house forever, I said don't you worry. - No! No! Really? Swear to me Did you say that? This promise This promise is from my love to your love We will no longer be separated. This promise is from my love to your love We will no longer be separated. God hears my heartbeat. How much my heart wants you You do not know. God hears my heartbeat. This is a promise. I forgot both worlds ... with the love I got from you. You can also use libertinage, Whether madness too The heart spoke, the heart listened. I chose you as my lover There are no longer distances between us. Our loyalty has brought glory to our love. God hears my heartbeat. This promise is your love from my love, we will no longer be separated. We will no longer be separated. God hears my heartbeat. Sir Sorry to bother you. Damn, junior I was having a very beautiful and romantic dream. You know, when Ansari's case is over I will marry Mahalakshmi. We will be a couple with many children. I will buy a new flat - Ansari's condition is serious. We have to rush him to the hospital. Come on! Kamlesh! Come on! Kamlesh! Come on! Faster! Faster! Come on! Kamlesh! Come on! Kamlesh! Faster! Come on! Come on! Come on! Faster! Kamlesh! What are you looking at? Mom, there's someone here. What's your name boy? - Who is it? I am Inspector Ashwin Gupte Oh yes I know! I know my husband told me You were with him in Chandangadh. When did you arrive? -Today -This morning. - I was very scared when I heard the news about you from tv. I prayed for you everyday. I was going to pray now. Where is he? Went to get a cold drink for you? Please come in - No I'm fine like this. What is the problem? Is everything okay? He ... isn't he here? Is he... What happened? He will not come Never. Your husband was a very brave man. He fought heroically. He was never afraid. He always remembered you until he took his last breath. He said you were a brave woman. You will take good care of the house and your son. You are right. These must be his words. I was so scared when he said he was going on duty that night. I tried to explain it to him. The other men come home in the evening after their duties are over. They play with their children and sleep peacefully. Look now, everything I told him to leave the job. Later, I wanted him to understand me with a little affection. He used to say, "Are you crazy?" Men in uniforms ensure safety on the streets so everyone sleeps comfortably. I told him to quit this job. Look now, it's all over. Mom, what happened? When will father come? Kamlesh Sawant. Slowly Be careful. Hurry, fast Take the survivor away fast. Sir, I want to talk to you. Wait, sir, he's dead. No no no. Lets! Lets! Come on! Ansari You can't do this to us. You cannot betray us. Come on, get up. Stand up! Stand up! Why don't you say anything, sir? Is it true that you took bribes from ISI? Your uniform is stained with blood. When will these murders stop? What did you gain by killing Ansari? Will you be saved this way? Why are you silent? Say something. I don't care what people think of me . That's why I I think it is my duty to say everything. The truth is that Since when have you been waiting here. We will deliver the dead to the municipality. Your son was a traitor, you won't find anyone to carry his corpse. O my Lord O my Lord sorry O my Lord O my Lord I'm sorry, I'm sorry O my Lord I'm sorry, I'm sorry O my Lord, forgive sorry O my Lord, forgive sorry We beg you We beg you O my Lord, forgive Have mercy on us. Have mercy on us. Have mercy on us. Let the poor be a support Someone who is drowning can reach the shore. An unwanted storm can be prevented If this is a sign If you have mercy, my lord There will be no worries around Forgive my Lord Forgive my Lord ... Whatever people say, my Lord knows the truth If my son was a criminal these good guys wouldn't be carrying it on their shoulders today They wouldn't be saying goodbye to him with such honor What's the difference now? Ansari died and the matter was closed. The case has not yet been closed. We buried Ansari, the case continues. Have you heard? Did you hear what he said? Today the criminal died buried with him in the trial And he talks about the trial of a dead man. You chose this officer. His words do not matter. - This is not important to you. You only care about the seat. Don't worry, I'll talk to him. Drink tea. Look, you don't have to worry. Investigation, press conference, etc. Just nonsense. Nothing will happen. In other words, it is necessary to stop silly statements with a short phrase. And try to understand me. I'm assigning you as deputy police chief. And then we'll make you Commissioner. When you retire, you will get a lot of money I will also encourage friends. And Ansari? - Ansari? He was a traitor. He died Don't think so much, with your daughter's wedding expenses I'll take care of it. Thank God I still believe in the law. Otherwise, I would cut off your tongue. Listen Anant - Say what you want In court, okay? Hey, what will happen in court? History is witness, and ministers and politicians have often been involved in fraud. I had clues, was the interrogation executed, there was a big commission, But what was the result? Nothing No minister has been punished and will never be. This is the law of our country. This law will change, Devdhar. And it will start with you. I pray it happens like this. Because if this doesn't happen I will beat you mercilessly I will inflict a lot of wounds on you Your pain will never end, you will be miserable. Be careful! We don't have much time. Devdhar is watching us They can come to arrest us at any time What are we going to do, sir? Poor Ansari died in vain. We do not have any witnesses or any evidence. We don't have any clue to find out the truth Yeah. A minute. Yes say it. Yeah? OK. Okay thanks. Mhatre called. I told him find the family of the deceased journalist Bhaskar He found where his son was. Here is his address. What a spell has poured over me ... What a spell has poured over me ...

My father never didn't mention about devdhar or any files. Try to remember, Chandu. Your father died fighting for a good cause. Wouldn't you like his work to find its place? So what should I do? Lots of people bother me by asking the same questions. They beat me. And I'm hiding from them. My father died, but my mother went crazy watching him die. One minute. Your father died in Chandangadh. How did your mother see it? It was broadcasted on TV. I was recording it while it was airing . So far, 71 people have died in communist riots in Chandangadh. 213 people were injured. And 3,000 people were left homeless. Ok now we zoom in Zoom in. Yes. More Zoom in. Zoom in, more G. P. O. The first word is definitely "GPO". - Ok. Postbox, 11... 5 Mumbai - Postbox 115, Mumbai.

He was about to ruin our business by creating an uproar. That's why I killed him. Found the file? Give it to me. Here, take this. I'll take care of them. But you? - Do not worry about me. This package should be given to Mr. Anant at all costs. Just give it to him. Understand? - Ok. Hey, I love you. I love you too. Be careful. Shekhar! Mahalakshmi! Watch Out! Stunned! miserable! What can I do? Love is a very strange feeling. Even a smart person turns into a fool. You were working for the Government. But my girlfriend was working for me. And you lot didn't have any doubts. She came with you at my command. So we can locate the file. She fooled all of you. Shekhar we have been to the GPO, where are you? Very smartly, she stayed with all of you. -Hello... So she gave information about your every move and every plan you make. I suddenly came to the haunted house I came to the empty station by train All thanks to these beautiful blue eyes. Mahalakshmi? With Aangre? She called me in front of you. I am her unfortunate and ill father. Shekhar, get out of there! Sorry, Shekhar. It is not good to have love in your works. You failed your duty, but I didn't. Now this advice will be useful for his next birth. Do you have any last wishes? - Come on, Shekhar! Get out of there! Don't tell anyone how I died. Otherwise, people will never believe in love anymore. Also, she will shoot the first bullet. I'm your mad lover I'll do everything for you. I will follow you to the end, even if you don't buy it. But sir, I will follow you till the end. I'm proud of you, Inspector Shekhar. You performed your duty till your last breath. No ... try to understand, Anant. Devdhar is a very powerful person. Even you can't do anything If a desperate person standing in the streets is saying this, I can understand. I understand it. I can understand! Liar because of his obsession with power ... ... if a politician like Devdhar utters this word, I will understand. I can understand ..! If a mad and berserk monster like Aangre says that ... I can even understand that. But you, you, bastard! You, you swore with me to protect the law. And you're telling me that! You say that! Please don't hit me! I'm with you I do not need you! I do not need you! I do not need you! Sir, I am following Mahalakshmi. She came out of the building. She's waiting to take a taxi. - Follow her. He'll take us to Angre. Keep me informed. I'm coming. Naidu said: Anant is seriously injured, he is in the hospital. Now there are no thorns in our way, Devdhar. No, no, Devdhar, I will not give the file. First of all, money will be transferred to my account . And then I will give you the file very fondly. I said no file. The fool, he still asks for the file. Ok then, otherwise this file will be published in tomorrow's newspaper. He transferring the money to our account. What is the price of this file, dear? - 5 million dollars. But it's not more valuable than you, my love. You were useful in life. You are useful while dying. You helped me in life and death. Nobody come down. Sir, stop! Please! - Leave me! Let me go! Sir, please stop. Let me go! Sir, please! Let me go! Considering all available evidence. The court reached a conclusion. It was understood that the accusations on Ansari were false. Therefore, this court sentences Minister Devdhar Additional Commissioner Shrikant Naidu and Yeshwant Aangre to life imprisonment. Always keep your head high, son. Your father was a very good man. His upbringing and education is now my responsibility. Good evening. Revenge is a strange feeling. It is like wine. The taste of old wine will be harsh. You will regret. You will regret it very much. Ashwin - Sir! Take him away. - Yes sir. This child is going to take me? I'm going. But I'll see you soon. Stop the car! Load quickly shoot two bullets at the van - Yes, sir. Sir, Sub Inspector Ashwin Gupte speaking. Bad news, sir. Sir, Aangre grabbed the officer's gun and tried to escape. I told him to surrender. But he opened fire on the police. Then I shot back and he got hurt. Yes, we are taking him to the hospital. But his chances of survival are slim. Yeah.
