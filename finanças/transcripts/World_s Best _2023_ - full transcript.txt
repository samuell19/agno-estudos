Well, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the New Jersey Mathlympics State Final. I've seen the best of the best, but I have never seen anything like this young man here. [presenter 1] Remarkable. Prem Patel of Jersey City has dominated this contest - since the very first equation. - [presenter 2] Absolutely. Twelve years old, 75 pounds, 5'1", the kid bleeds numbers. [chuckles] Now the question, of course, on everyone's mind here today is, "Can this youngster win it all?" Come on, Prem! You got this, baby! Go, go, go! - Bring it home, my dog. - [presenter 1] Working in parentheses, some of the most difficult work you'll ever have to do. [presenter 2] I've never seen some of these numbers. [presenter 1] I still think square root has something to do with gardening. - [both laugh] - Whoo! That's my son! - [spectator 1] Yeah! - I made him. [spectator 2] Amazing! [presenter 1] And here it comes. Wow. Uh, wait a second. Now hold the phone. A bit of a changeup here. With seconds left on the clock, Prem is heading back to his own bench. Prem! What are you doing? Get back over there! [presenter 1] Favorite teacher, Mr. Oh. No surprises there. [presenter 2] There's Jerome, Prem's best friend. [presenter 1] You may recall, of course, that Claire, Prem's teammate, was the actual favorite heading into this final. - [presenter 2] Now he's eating her lunch. - [presenter 1] He is. Look at... [presenter 2] Chugging that chocolate milk like it was water. [presenter 1] Wow. No lactose intolerance there. [sighs] Tastes like victory. [cheering] - [presenter 1] Wow. What a showboat. - [presenter 2] Ooh! [presenter 1] Getting down to the final crunch now. And, looking good, yes. - [presenter 2] Yes. - [presenter 1] Here it comes. Wow. - [buzzer blares] - [presenter 1] Prem Patel at the buzzer! Do you believe in miracles? We're number one! We're number one! [mother] We're number one! That's my baby! [crowd cheering] [spectator 3] I love you, Prem! [presenter 1] Prem! Prem! Prem, you just won the Mathlympics with the best score in history. What is your secret? Hard work. Like my dad used to say, "The world's best never rest." [cheering] Absolutely beautiful. Let's take some questions from the audience. [crowd member] What's up, guys? It's your boy, Brooklyn. Wait. Why are we taking questions? Well, it's really more of a comment. Remember, Prem, math is for losers. [Mr. Oh] Oh, wow. He's right. - Math is so lame. - No, listen. - What am I doing here? - Later, nerds. - Let's go do something cool. - Finally. I'll drive. - [Brooklyn] Shotgun. - Wait. Come back! Math is cool! I promise! [alarm clock rings] [ringing stops] [sighs] "The world's best never rest." [sighs] [sighs] ♪ Whoa-oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh ♪ Happy first day of seventh grade. - Did you have another math dream? - Yep. - Did you win? - Yep. Nice. [podcaster on headset] Welcome back. Today we will explore how the loss of a loved one can keep us from becoming our best selves. Stop moving. Find a quiet place to reflect on your loss. A caterpillar who loses a leg can regrow it by becoming a butterfly. [podcaster] But first, its whole body dissolves. Dissolve to evolve. Say it with me. Hard pass. Your egg whites are on the table. Have you considered my proposal regarding Pop-Tarts? Have you considered living in reality? You need brain food today. [podcaster] Float away from grief and face the future with an open heart. Which brings us to our next sponsor. Got Oat? Oat Milk. Use the checkout code "Yogi" for a 10% discount on Got Oat? - 324? - Eighteen. - 676? - Twenty-six. - 121? - Eleven. - Negative nine? - Trick question. The square root of a negative number isn't a number. Not a real number. It's something called an imaginary number. - No way. - Way! How else do you think my math club won Nationals? We partied so hard afterwards, we shut down the hot tub at the Motel 6. [chuckles] Cool. Yeah, I was so excited, I threw up everywhere. Oh. [student 1] Wow, that little boy brought his mommy. [student 2 laughs] - What's that girl looking at? - [students laugh] [sighs] It's cool, Mom. No. Somebody should tell her, "Staring is rude." - I'll get her parents' names. - [sighs] Mom, please. Hey! The last patient I had that ate Pop-Tarts? - Completely toothless. All gums. - Please, stop. - It's my first day. Mom! - People called her Gummy Bear. - There's no tooth fairy for that, honey. - [Prem] It's my first day. Okay. So, after math at the high school, you'll take the bus back to junior high - for the rest of your classes. - Like we talked about. I'll pick you up at the rec center when I get off. - Hopefully around 5:00. - Just like last year. No synthetic sugar, no car rides from strangers. - If something happens, you... - Nothing is gonna happen, Mom. Seriously, I got this. You got this. - [student 3] Zach, go long! - [Zach] Over here.

We have Prim Patel. Did I say that right? It's, uh, Prem, like name. - Prim. - Prem. - Preem. - Prem. - Praheem. - Prem. - Prahahaha. - Perfect. Okeydokey. And we have Claire Beauséjour. You two are the only junior high students who passed the entrance exam. You must be quite the dynamic duo. - Affirmative. - Yep. [Ms. Sage] Well, who knows what time it is? It's time for our first math quiz! [chuckles] Oh, and listen, for those of you who are worried about grades, I make a deal with all of my classes. Does anyone from last year remember? Anyone? You know, my deal that I make? [grunts] Mercedes? If the Mathlympics team finishes in the top three, everyone on it gets an automatic A. That's right. It was so much fun last year, by the way. - Ma'am, we got destroyed. Like, dead last. - Winning isn't everything. Unless you need that A, right? You literally just said... This is our year, because we're hosting the event. I rented a disco ball! [chuckles] Dope. Do we still get to eat at Olive Garden after we lose? Uh, well, this year... [chuckles] ...um, our budget includes Taco Bell. - Is that as punishment? - No, no. Now, no. You don't have to write this down. Okay. On your marks, get set, solve! [school bell rings] All righty. Oh! Okay, everybody, for your first homework assignment, what I want you to do is write an equation with you as the solution. Okay? And then you work backwards to show how all the elements of your life make up who you are. It's gonna be so much fun. So, really, have a lot of fun with it. Okay? And you might even surprise yourself. All righty.

Help me stretch my hammies, bro. I need to get loose. Sorry I'm late. I was, you know, in high school. Oh, yeah. I texted you good luck, right? Nah, it's cool. Cool. My phone was blowing up this morning. Like, I didn't have enough thumbs. - You know what I mean? - Totally. Class was great, by the way. But some of those kids, no wonder they always lose the Mathlympics. That's before they had you, right? [sighs] Math champ. You'll pass the AP exam this year for sure. Then they'll have both of us. The Dynamic Duo. [phone pings] - [Prem] How's Amanda? - Amazing. She's the best thing that ever happened to me. Wow. - Actually, I need to tell you something. - [student] Amanda! Hey, girl! I think we should take a break from hanging out. - Just for a while. - Whoops! Sorry, fellas! Sorry, man. What do you mean, a break? You know, just a break. I need to make some time for Amanda. - Now there's school... - We crush school. Everyone knows it. That's not what I wanna be known for, you know? I mean, I'm not the math guy. That's just what people think when we're together. The math guy? Sup, dorks? - Just ignore him. - Sup, BK! J-Dog! Peep my new dance. - Stop. - J-Dog? But Brooklyn's so mean to us, and Sharn was held back. BK's nice to me. And Sharn says eighth grade's nothing but a number. They need one more in their dance crew for the Fall Talent Show. You're not a dance guy, are you? I don't know. My dad says if I just put myself out there, I might like it. - [Brooklyn] Yo, J-Dog. - [Sharn] J-Doggy Dog! Come here! - J-Dizzle. - [Brooklyn] J-Dog! Yo! [Sharn] J-Diggity! [chuckles] [Jerome] Yo, B. Did you see my video? It just dropped. [thunder rumbles] [raindrops falling] [mother] Prem, you will not believe what happened at work today. Ronda was measuring a diuretic for a patient, and she was using deciliters instead of cubic centimeters. I was like, "Honey, he's gonna pee forever." Ronda, more like Wrongda. [chuckles] Wrongda. Mmm. So, how'd you do in math today? It was good. We had a quiz. - [mother] And? - I was the only one who finished. There it is. How was the rest of your day? I actually need some help with something. A homework assignment. Of course. Math homework? It's about Dad. Sorry. I know you don't like to talk about him. Suresh would want us to be happy. Not dissolve into tears like some sad caterpillar. - Huh? - This needs pepper. So, what do you need for your homework? - What was he known for? - Known for? - I mean, was he smart? - Definitely, but he wasn't a math guy. - What kind of guy was he? - [sighs] There it is. I'll never know who I am unless I know who he was. He was... funny, confident, handsome. - He was like you. Everyone loved him. - Doesn't sound like me at all. I'm sorry. I don't really know how to help. Just tell me anything. Tell me about the night that photo was taken. That was a very long time ago. What's the Leopard Lounge? It's the club where we met. - Like a dance club? - A hip-hop club. Your father had a real way with words. Wait. Dad was a rapper? How else do you think he came up with, "The world's best never rest"? Mom, that is so cool. Was he good? He was... one of the best I've ever seen. I wish you could've seen him. Sometimes I forget how he looked and how he sounded. Okay. [chuckles] So, when I was in nursing school, we used to go dancing on the weekends. My girlfriends told me about this place. It was poppin'. [mother] And the Leopard Lounge had this thing called Freestyle Tuesdays. You said you only went on weekends. Well, some Tuesdays. Not if we had exams. I don't need to explain myself. Anyway, you were at the club. We were at the club, and my girlfriends were saying... This emcee's an underground legend. - Blah, blah, blah, blah. - Blah, blah. - Blah, blah. [chuckles] - Why are they... I wasn't really listening. - Blah, blah, blah. - Blah, blah, blah, blah. I had a lot on my mind, like school... Priya, stop thinking about Doug. Okay? It's over. He's not even that cute. Who's Doug? Who? I don't know. I can't really remember... Good thing we stopped you from getting that tattoo of his name, huh? We literally saved your butt. [friend 1] Hey, girl. We'll go grab our drinks. So, we get in, and we're waiting for the show to start when... [person] Excuse me. ["My Heart Will Go On" playing] I don't have a line. I just wanted to meet you. My name's Suresh. - I'm not interested. - [song stops] - Okay. [chuckles] - That's what you said to Dad? I didn't feel like being hit on. - Would you like to have a drink? - No. I don't drink anything ever. - Then why are you in a nightclub? - Thank you. Bye. I wanna walk away. I really do. - Please do. - Yes. You've set a clear boundary. The only problem is you're the prettiest girl in the room. - Oh? - And I just have this thing inside of me that also tells me that you're the smartest. Like you probably got a... What, 1550 on the SATs? [scoffs] Excuse me? - 1600, see? - Thank you. - I went low so that I... - How did you know I was smart? I could tell from your footwear, 'cause it's very sensible for a nightclub. - Also, if it gets cold... - [Priya] Uh-huh. You've got the turtleneck motif. - It's mesh. - Mm-hmm. Mom, don't shut him down. You need to make a baby. Listen, I got a thing to do, but if you change your mind about that drink... - Don't hold your breath. - You remind me of my mother. I love you. Goodbye. So cold. Well, yeah, 'cause you know he's your dad now. For all I knew back then, he could've been a psycho axe murderer. So dark. It happened. 2000s were a very dangerous time. - [crowd cheering] - [deejay] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the World's Best Emcee. - Let's make some noise. - [crowd] Whoo! It's him. It's the legendary emcee. He's gonna use his music to melt your cold heart. - [phone ringing] - Hmm? No, wait. What are you doing? Don't you answer that. No, Mom. Mom! - [Doug] ...what to do, but you were gone. - Doug, listen. You're so checked out. I can't believe you missed the show. - I can't believe you're so judgy. - Are you listening to me? Doug, I'm sorry. I think I just fell in love with the idea of you. But you have no culture, Doug. Name all four members of Destiny's Child. There's no one named Shelly on Destiny's Child. - [sighs] - [friend 2] Blah, blah, blah. [chuckles] Blah, blah, blah, blah. [friend 2] Blah, blah, blah.

Did he go on tour? No, it wasn't like that. You have such an overactive imagination, Prem. But you said he was a legendary emcee. That he was the best in the city, maybe even the world. I mean, Suresh didn't care about that stuff. He didn't need anyone to tell him how great he was. He knew. He did it because he loved it.

Like my dad is "just friends" with Brooklyn's mom. Kiss her to say thanks, Prem. Give me that. We're not even friends, okay? Creepy Claire. [Mr. Oh] They found your jacket at the gym. What's going on over here? [school bell rings] Is this what living at a hundred feels like? 'Cause it sucks. I didn't tell you to pick on Ginny Weasley. You said hip-hop was 50% confidence. Whoa. Phony rappers knock other people down to build themselves up. Real emcees, like us, we own who we are. That's what makes us untouchable. Like Mercedes's superpower? Exactly like that. Let me see that. Look, it's the difference between running your mouth and having something to say. Yikes. Oh. Hey, Priya. How have you been? - Busy. Stressed. So, the usual. - [Mr. Oh] Hmm. Yeah. - I get it. [chuckles] - Yeah. You? Same. I feel like a fifth of my former self. But my therapist says I'm two-tenths. [chuckles] [chuckles, snorts] Okay. - That's really bad. - I couldn't resist. [both chuckling] - We should... - Sorry if I made it weird. - No. It's fine. - I was out of line to ask you out. No, no. Not out of line. It's just... Tacky. You're Prem's teacher. Well, technically not anymore. He just might not understand if we... He-He understands calculus, but... Emotionally. Emotionally. He's so into her. - [Priya giggles] - I told you. So, have you told the girl's parents what happened? You know, their houseboat doesn't have a phone. So I could try writing them a letter or something. But you know, I think Claire will be fine. It's uh... It's Prem who worries me. Yeah. The fight was over an old notebook. Prem said it belonged to his dad. He signed up for the talent show as the World's Best... Riding in cars with high schoolers? What are their names? [gasps] Do they vape? - Mom. - And what happened to your hair? They're helping me get ready for the show. No, you're quitting the show. You need to focus on your schoolwork. Mom, please. I can't let the haters win. - Winning isn't everything. - Since when? You push me to be the best at math, but when I wanna be the best at something else, it's not important. You love math. You have a gift. It's just not cool anymore. Give me the notebook. It's a rhyme book. You didn't even know it existed. You just threw his stuff in a box and shoved it in a closet. - Prem. - I need it to learn how to rap. - My dad was the World's Best Emcee. - That is not... This obsession with your father isn't healthy. We have to move on. I listened to a whole podcast... Acting like he never existed isn't moving on. I'm not doing this with you. - Give me the notebook. Now. - No. - He'd want me to have it. - You don't know what he'd want. You didn't know him. I mean, Suresh didn't want you to be him. He wanted you to work hard and get good grades, a good job... So I can be you? [sighs] [Ms. Sage] Okay. I've got the 50 Lunchables. I'll add the 30 granola bars. And that'll be enough for the State Mathlympics snack table. [gasps] It's right around the corner, people. We still haven't locked in a judge, but I got a soft yes from Neil Patrick Harris. [laughs] You know, I taught Neil.

Cream soda's five bucks. My father used to perform here. He was an emcee. - Maybe you saw him? - A lot of people perform here, kid. But he was an underground legend. The best rapper in the city, maybe even the whole world. Sick. Can he do a set here tonight? No, he can't. - [sighs] - Wait. You're Suresh's kid, aren't you? Man, Suresh. [laughs] Nobody did it better. So he really was here. [chuckles] Yeah, he was here all the time. Man never knew how to shut up. - [all chuckle] - That's definitely him. Yeah? [chuckles] I heard that he... I'm sorry. Hey. I-I have a picture of him down there. You wanna see it? Yeah. [bartender sighs] Yeah. What's this? [bartender] That's your dad doing his thing. But he was an emcee. Oh, I know. [chuckles] We worked together for five years. He talked a better game than anyone. And his favorite thing to talk about was hip-hop. [Suresh] Nas had Primo. Pac had Dre. Biggie made "Juicy Fruit" a hit. Treach, Krayzie Bone, Slick Rick. Don't sleep on the West Coast cats like Gift of Gab. Hey. What about Fred Durst? He can spit. What? Eddie, that sentence is not gonna age well. Listen, I'm the expert, okay? And I'll tell you all, I'm gonna be at the top of the list one day. Yo, Skee-Lo. One more. I've been waiting. Fine, but only because I'm scared of you. Dad? Suresh had big dreams. The way he talked about it, it was like he was his own hype man. All right, grumpy. Here you go. This one's on me because I made you wait. But just so you know, the man pouring you your drink right now is gonna be a world-famous rapper. [scoffs] Okay. Oh, you laugh. But I've been grinding on my rhymes. I will be doing shows. I'm gonna do features. I'll put out a album. And everything in this book will make me the World's Best Emcee. Okay? You heard it here first. Hey, Corey. Make your next move your best move, huh? - Put me on tonight. - I can't do it. I need you back here. - We have that bachelor party later. - [sighs] [Corey] I should've put him on too. I mean, I would see him at open mics after work with the fellas. - He had skills. - But what happened? [Corey] Well, nothing happened. One day he quit, and I heard he moved to Jersey and settled down, you know? Typical story. [glass shattering] - Yo, Suresh. Can you get that for me? - Yes, sir. One second. - I'm leaking genius over here. - [sighs] Come on, brother. Now, please. [chuckles] The world's best never rest. Am I right? [laughs] [Suresh] Okay. Oh, right. Give the man a free drink and he drops it on the ground. Well done. I got it. I got it. You're not getting another one. Hey, Corey. We need a smaller broom. I'm gonna get carpal tunnels. [Gabe] What does that dude even know about rap anyways? - He's just some bartender. - Gabe! [Gabe] Which is a great job obviously. [Mercedes] So your dad wasn't a rap legend. Doesn't mean you won't be. Shoot. My dad's a dentist. [Gabe] Yeah, my dad's legit into camping. Like... [Mercedes] See? It doesn't mean anything. He failed. It means that's a part of my equation.

Oh, my God. [chuckles] [footsteps approaching] Suresh got this when you were born. Prem means love. And Krishna is the god of love. I was the thinker, and he was the dreamer. I forgot how much I missed that about him. Until I started seeing it in you. You're more like him every day, Prem. I wasn't ready for it, but I'm sorry I ever asked you to be anything else. I'm sorry too. You know, hip-hop was the love of your father's life until... He met you? Until he met you, Prem. Suresh loved being your dad more than anything. That's who he was. He was the best dad. I know. Hey. I called in sick. I thought maybe we could go into the city. Leopard Lounge is played out, but I know this sick spot in Harlem with a killer open mic. Suresh took me there to see Naughty by Nature. ♪ Hip-hop, hooray Ho, hey, ho ♪ - [chuckles] - You think I don't know hip-hop? It's just like math. When it's right, it just flows. It makes sense of the universe. [Prem sighs] There's something else I have to do today. To help my friends. Something I love to do.

[crowd chanting] World's Best! Sounds like the right answer to me. What am I looking at? It's destiny, baby. [Ms. Sage] It's time to make math-e-magic, people! Guess what?
