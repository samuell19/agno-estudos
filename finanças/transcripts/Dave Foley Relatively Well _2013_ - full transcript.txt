OH, KEEP IT GOING. KEEP IT GOING. KEEP IT GOING. KEEP IT GOING. KEEP IT... KEEP IT GOING. SERIOUSLY, KEEP IT GOING. KEEP IT GOING. YOU'RE NOT KEEPING IT GOING. KEEP IT GOING! KEEP IT GOING. EVERYONE ELSE IS KEEPING IT GOING. YOU KEEP IT GOING TOO. KEEP IT GOING OR YOU'LL ALL FUCKING DIE. I SWEAR TO GOD, YOU'LL ALL DIE IF YOU DON'T KEEP IT... KEEP IT GOING! KEEP IT GOING! KEEP IT GOING! OR, I SWEAR TO GOD, WE'LL ALL... KEEP IT GOING! WE'LL ALL FUCKING DIE. I SWEAR... KEEP IT GOING! KEEP IT GOING! KEEP IT GOING! KEEP IT GOING! THAT'S A MOVIE IDEA I'M WORKING ON. UH, IT'S CALLED KEEP IT GOING. IT'S ABOUT A NIGHTCLUB MC WHO HAS TO, UH... HE HAS TO KEEP IT GOING, OR A BOMB'S GONNA GO OFF. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE HUGE. I THINK IT'LL BE HUGE. WHAT ELSE CAN I TELL YOU? I'M NOT GAY. THERE YOU GO, I'M NOT GAY. I'M JUST PUTTING IT OUT THERE, I'M NOT GAY. UH, SORRY, LADIES, I'M NOT GAY. AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK I'M GAY. A LOT OF PEOPLE THING ALL OF THE KIDS IN THE HALL ARE GAY, AND I GET THAT, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE DID A LOT OF GAY STUFF. WELL, WE DID A LOT OF GAY MATERIAL IS WHAT WE DID. WE DID... ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, ONE OF US DID DO A LOT OF GAY STUFF. I THINK... I'M PRETTY SURE SCOTT COMPLETED HIS CHECKLIST. HE CAN RETIRE OR BECOME STRAIGHT. THOSE ARE HIS OPTIONS NOW. BUT I'M NOT GAY. AND THAT'S GOOD, 'CAUSE, UH, 'CAUSE BEING GAY IS WRONG. BECAUSE GOD... GOD HATES GAYS. UH, ANYONE HERE GAY? OH! GOD HATES YOU. SORRY, I HOPE I'M NOT THE FIRST ONE TO TELL YOU. I'M SORRY. THAT'S KIND... THAT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL, GOD HATING YOU AND ALL. I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE, LIKE, TAKEN YOU ASIDE AND TOLD YOU PRIVATELY. JUST LANDING IT RIGHT ON YOUR LAP IN FRONT OF PEOPLE, THAT'S RUDE. PROBABLY PLANNED, "OH, I'M GOING TO GO OUT AND SEE DAVE FOLEY. IT'LL BE FUN. WHAT? GOD HATES ME?" BUT HE DOES. GOD HATES YOU, AND IT'S SAD. MAKES ME FEEL BADLY FOR GOD, BECAUSE GOD'S BEEN CREATING THE UNIVERSE FOR A LONG TIME NOW, AND HE HATES THE GAYS, BUT HE CAN'T SEEM TO STOP MAKING 'EM. THAT'S GOT TO BE FRUSTRATING FOR GOD. HE'S UP THERE IN HEAVEN MAKING SOULS, AND ONE OUT OF TEN KEEPS COMING OUT GAY. UP THERE IN HIS WORKSHOP, JUST, OH, MAKING SOULS. HERE WE GO. SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE... AW, FUCK, IT'S GAY. OH, WELL, JUST KEEP FOCUSED. SEVEN, EIGHT... OH, FUCK, ANOTHER GAY ONE. THIS IS BULLSHIT. BUT IT'S... I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE HE, LIKE, TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT. IT'S NOT LIKE HE, YOU KNOW, GOES... COMES OUT AND SAYS, "HEY. GOD. I'M HERE, AND I'M SORRY. "I KEEP MAKING ALL THESE GAY SOULS, AND I DON'T MEAN... "'CAUSE YOU KNOW I HATE THE FAGS. "YOU'VE READ THE PLACARDS, UH, "THAT MY CHOSEN SPOKESPEOPLE CARRY "TO MILITARY FUNERALS FOR SOME REASON. "YOU KNOW I HATE THEM, BUT I CAN'T SEEM... "WE HAVE SOME... IT'S A PROBLEM IN PRODUCTION. WE'RE WORKING ON IT, BUT RIGHT NOW I CAN'T HELP IT." INSTEAD HE COPS OUT AND MAKES EXCUSES THE WAY HE ALWAYS DOES WHEN HE FUCKS UP. HE ALWAYS THROWS IT BACK ON THE SAME BULLSHIT ANSWER, YOU KNOW. "IT'S FREE WILL." IT'S LIKE, "GOD, WHY IS THERE EVIL?" "IT'S FREE WILL. MY HANDS ARE CLEAN." IT'S FREE WILL. WE NEED EVIL TO APPRECIATE THE GOOD, WHICH IS BULLSHIT. I THINK I WOULD TOTALLY APPRECIATE A WORLD WHERE NOTHING SHITTY EVER HAPPENED. I'D BE FINE WITH THAT. I WOULD BE SO FINE. I DON'T THINK I'D EVER GET BORED AND START GOING, "OH, I WISH "I COULD EXPERIENCE PAIN AND SUFFERING. "I MEAN, 'CAUSE I REALLY ENJOY EATING MY PIE RIGHT NOW, "BUT, YOU KNOW, IMAGINE HOW MUCH MORE I WOULD APPRECIATE MY PIE "IF PEOPLE GOT AIDS. "I MEAN, IF YOU JUST COMPARE HAVING AIDS TO EATING PIE, "THEN YOU REALIZE HOW GOOD IT IS TO EAT PIE. IT'S WORTH THE SACRIFICE." BUT GOD SAYS IT'S NOT HIS PROBLEM, IT'S CHOICE. IT'S FREE WILL. THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE, GAY RIGHTS. IT'S NOT A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE, 'CAUSE IT'S A CHOICE. PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING TO BE GAY. WHICH SEEMS STRANGE, 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE CHOOSING TO BE GAY, THEN IT MUST BE A CHOICE TO BE STRAIGHT. 'CAUSE YOU GOT TO HAVE AT LEAST TWO CHOICES FOR A CHOICE TO EXIST. THAT'S HOW CHOOSING WORKS, YOU KNOW? SO, IF GAY IS A CHOICE, THEN STRAIGHT MUST LOGICALLY ALSO BE A CHOICE, AND AS A STRAIGHT MAN, I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M CHOOSING TO BE STRAIGHT. I DON'T FIND MYSELF AT THE END OF THE DAY GOING, "HEY, DAVE, "WHAT A LOT OF GREAT CHOICES YOU MADE TODAY. "WAY TO NOT SUCK A COCK ALL DAY. "AWESOME CHOOSING, DAVE. "WHEN YOU GOT HOME AND WATCHED TV, "WAY TO NOT DO IT IN THE ARMS OF A LOVING MAN. WELL DONE, DAVE. I'M PROUD OF YOU." YOU KNOW, SO I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW? SO I'M THINKING, LIKE, IF YOU ARE A STRAIGHT MAN, AND YOU DO FEEL LIKE THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING TO BE STRAIGHT ALL THE TIME, GUESS WHAT? YOU'RE GAY, JUST GAY. AH. BUT AS I SAID, I'M... I'M NOT GAY. MM-MMM. I'M NOT. A LOT OF TIMES, I WISH I WAS GAY, UH, OR STRAIGHTER, UM, OR STILL EXCITED ABOUT FUCKING. I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I WISH. I WISH FUCKING STILL EXCITED ME THE WAY IT USED TO, YOU KNOW? 'CAUSE I'M AT A POINT IN MY LIFE NOW WHERE WHEN I'M FUCKING, I'M JUST HOPING ONE OF US COMES BEFORE I GET WINDED. THAT'S... THAT'S THE HEIGHT OF MY AMBITION RIGHT NOW. TO ME, FUCKING IS LIKE BEING AT BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN CONCERT, WHERE I GO, "OH, THIS IS AWESOME. "I CAN'T WAIT TILL IT'S OVER AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT A GOOD TIME WE HAD." YOU KNOW? 'CAUSE LIKE, WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG, YOU'LL, LIKE, TRY ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT POSITIONS, 'CAUSE IT'S HOT. I MEAN, "YEAH, LET'S FUCK UPSIDE DOWN IN THE FRIDGE." BUT IF I'M TRYING DIFFERENT POSITIONS NOW, IT'S JUST 'CAUSE I'M SEARCHING FOR ONE WHERE I DON'T HAVE TO CARRY ALL MY WEIGHT ON MY ARMS, OR I'M NOT GONNA THROW MY BACK OUT, 'CAUSE IF THAT HAPPENS, I'M NOT COMING. OH, YOU KNOW, ANY DISCOMFORT, I WON'T BE COMING. I'LL KEEP FUCKING, 'CAUSE YOU GOT TO PLAY HURT. THAT'S WHAT I LEARNED FROM HOCKEY. YOU GOT TO PLAY HURT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE BIG LEAGUES, AND I DO, BUT ANY DISCOMFORT, AND I WILL NOT BE COMING... OR DISTRACTION. IF THE TV IS ON, I WILL NOT COME. AND THIS PROBLEM IS EXACERBATED FOR ME BECAUSE, UH, BECAUSE I TAKE ANTI-DEPRESSANTS, UH, BECAUSE LIFE IS GOOD. ANYONE HERE ON ANTI-DEPRESSANTS? ANYONE? male audience member: ALL RIGHT, I THINK ME AND WHOEVER IT WAS THAT RESPONDED LIKE THIS, WE NEED TO GET ON YOUR PRESCRIPTION. BUT IT'S TRUE, IF YOU TAKE ANTI-DEPRESSANTS, SOME ANTI-DEPRESSANTS... YOU MAY BE AWARE OF THIS... CAN INTERFERE WITH ORGASM. AND BY INTERFERE, THEY MEAN YOU'RE NOT FUCKING GOING TO HAVE ONE. YOU'LL GET HARD, BUT YOU WON'T COME, WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN I FIRST STARTED TAKING THEM, BUT THEN I THOUGHT THIS IS AWESOME! I CAN FUCK FOREVER NOW. I CAN FUCK FOREVER. I'M A FUCKING MACHINE. I CAN JUST FUCK AND FUCK AND FUCK. FUCK AND FUCK AND FUCK AND FUCK. FUCK, AND I'M LIKE STING, BUT WITHOUT ANY OF THAT DISCIPLINE... OR SHITTY WORLD MUSIC. BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT, YOU REALIZE IT'S NOT THAT AWESOME. WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN AT THE WOMAN THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY FUCKING, AND REALIZE THAT SHE'S JUST BORED. SHE'S FUCKING B... SHE'S PLAYING WORDS WITH FRIENDS... WHO ARE ACTUALLY IN THE ROOM. SHE'S INVITED PEOPLE OVER. SHE'S LIKE, "COME ON OVER. KEEP ME COMPANY UNTIL THIS ASSHOLE COMES, WOULD YOU?" AND, WOMEN, YOU DON'T TAKE IT WELL WHEN A MAN DOESN'T COME. YOU'RE NOT USED TO IT. LIFE HASN'T PREPARED YOU FOR A MAN NOT COMING. YOUR EGO REALLY DOES NOT TAKE IT WELL AT ALL. YOU'RE PREPARED FOR US COMING WAY TOO FAST, AND THEN BITCHING ABOUT IT TO YOUR FRIENDS. BUT IF WE DON'T COME, YOU JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT, YOU KNOW? WE'RE USED TO IT, BUT, UH, YOU KNOW... BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NOW MEN CAN FAKE ORGASM. WE CAN. WE CAN FAKE ORGASM. YEAH, NOW THAT WE ALL WEAR CONDOMS, THANKS TO AIDS... AND THANK YOU, AIDS... THANK YOU, AIDS, FOR THE CONDOMS. 'CAUSE NOW, AFTER, LIKE, A COUPLE OF HOURS OF POINTLESS FUCKING, YOU KNOW, WHERE, LIKE... WHERE HER LABIA'S, LIKE, POLISHED TO A SHEEN AT THIS POINT, YOU KNOW? IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S GOT A PAIR OF PURPLE PATENT LEATHER SHOES BETWEEN HER THIGHS. YOU KNOW? I SHOULD JUST LET YOU SIT WITH THAT IMAGE FOR A WHILE. BUT I CAN LET HER OFF THE HOOK. I CAN JUST... I CAN GO, "OH, AWESOME! "OH, OH, GREAT. "I'M JUST GOING TO GO TAKE THIS THING OFF NOW. "YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE THIS, BUT TRUST ME, IT'S QUITE A LOAD. "YOU CAN BE PROUD OF THE WORK YOU'VE DONE TONIGHT, MISSY. NO SHAME SPIRAL FOR YOU." DOESN'T WORK AS WELL DURING A BLOW JOB. YOU CAN'T FAKE IT DURING A... I'VE TRIED. YOU GET CAUGHT. AND BOY, WOMEN, YOU REALLY DON'T TAKE THAT WELL. IF WE DON'T COME DURING A BLOW JOB, OH, THAT REALLY GETS YOUR EGO UP, 'CAUSE IT'S A SPECIAL GIFT YOU'RE GIVING. BUT... AND HERE'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED. WOMEN WILL NOT GIVE UP ON A BLOW JOB. WOMEN WILL FUCKING JUST NOT GIVE UP ON A BLOW... WOMEN BECOME LIKE TV E.R. SURGEONS WITH A BLOW JOB, AND IT'S LIKE, "NOT TONIGHT. NOT TONIGHT, GOD DAMN IT. NO." KEEP GOING AND GOING AND GOING UNTIL, LIKE, YOUR LIPS ARE SWOLLEN AND NUMB, AND YOUR JAW IS SORE. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU JUST GOT OUT OF THE DENTIST'S CHAIR. AND I CAN SAY, "I DON'T NEED TO COME. COMING ISN'T EVEN MY THING, REALLY." "OH, JUST SHUT UP AND COME, YOU SON OF A BITCH." AT WHICH POINT, I MEAN, I CAN, LIKE, CLOSE MY EYES AND TRY TO FANTASIZE ABOUT SOMETHING TO HELP ME COME FASTER, BUT I'M ALREADY GETTING A FUCKING BLOW JOB. THAT'S MY GO-TO FANTASY. I'VE GOT NO ROOM TO MANEUVER. AHH! LET ME TELL YOU... LET ME TELL YOU HOW FUCKED UP I AM SEXUALLY. IN CASE I HAVEN'T MADE MY CASE YET. HERE'S HOW FUCKED UP I AM SEXUALLY. I HAD A DREAM RECENTLY, A SEX DREAM. I HAD A SEX DREAM, AND THIS IS TRUE. IN MY SEX DREAM, UH, I WAS JUST JERKING OFF. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? HOW FUCKING ANTI-SOCIAL HAVE I BECOME THAT THAT'S MY SEX DREAM? JUST JERKING OFF... I'M JUST JERKING OFF. I MEAN, I COULD BE FUCKING ANYONE. I COULD BE FUCKING ANYONE. I COULD BE FUCKING HISTORICAL FIGURES. I COULD BE DOUBLE-TEAMING CLEOPATRA WITH WINSTON CHURCHILL... IT'S MY DREAM! "I WILL FUCK HER IN THE MOUTH, "AND YOU WILL FUCK HER IN THE ASS, AND WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER!" THAT COULD BE MY DREAM. I COULD FUCK ANYONE. BUT I CHOOSE ME... I'M FUCKING ME. THAT'S WHO I'M FUCKING IN MY DREAM. I'M JUST JERKING OFF, AND IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A SHAME DREAM, WHERE I'M JERKING OFF, AND THEN I REALIZE I'M ON A PUBLIC BUS, AND I GO, "OH, FUCK, I'VE GOT TEN STOPS TO GO. BE COOL." I HAVE HAD THAT DREAM MANY TIMES, TRUST ME. NO, THIS DREAM, I'M JERKING OFF IN MY BATHROOM. AND IN THE DREAM, I TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK OVER AT THE DOOR AND GO, "OH, GOOD, IT'S LOCKED." I'M JERKING OFF IN A LOCKED BATHROOM IN MY APARTMENT, AND THEN I WAKE UP, AND I'M DISAPPOINTED IT'S A DREAM. THE BATHROOM IS TEN FEET FROM MY BED. I CAN GET UP, GO TO THE BATHROOM, AND LIVE THE DREAM. BUT I JUST LIE THERE AND SULK. YEAH, THAT'S FUCKED UP. BUT I AM STILL... I'M GRATEFUL THAT I STILL GET FUCKED OCCASIONALLY. WELL, MORE THAN OCCASIONALLY. I'M FAMOUS. IT HELPS. AND I THINK... I APPRECIATE THAT I STILL GET FUCKED. I THINK I PROBABLY APPRECIATE IT MORE THAN MOST OF YOU DO. IN FACT, I DON'T THINK SOME OF YOU APPRECIATE THAT I GET FUCKED AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU EVEN TAKE THE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT. ALL ABOUT YOU, ISN'T IT? BUT SURE, I DO APPRECIATE IT, BECAUSE I WENT FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE I DIDN'T GET FUCKED. I WENT 11 YEARS WITHOUT BEING FUCKED. YEAH, IT WAS DURING MY FIRST MARRIAGE. IT'S A TRUE STORY. YEAH, I WAS MARRIED TO THIS WOMAN FOR 11 YEARS WHO WOULDN'T FUCK ME, AND TO BE FAIR, IT WASN'T ENTIRELY HER FAULT, BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED AS BEING A CUNT. I MEAN, TECHNICALLY THE DIAGNOSIS WAS BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER, BUT TRUST ME, "CUNT" COVERS IT. AND I EXAGGERATE SLIGHTLY, 'CAUSE SHE WOULD ACTUALLY FUCK ME, LIKE, ONCE A YEAR. SHE WOULD FUCK ME. IT WOULD BE JUST... OUT OF NOWHERE, SHE WOULD SUDDENLY JUST GO, "ALL RIGHT, JUST DO IT. JUST FUCK ME NOW. JUST DO IT. GET IT OVER WITH." NO, I'M NOT GOING TO FUCK YOU LIKE THIS. NO, YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A RAPIST. I'M NOT GOING TO FUCK YOU LIKE... THAT'S RIDICULOUS. SHE'D GO, "FUCK ME NOW OR I'LL KILL MYSELF." OH, GREAT. THAT'S A SEXY CHOICE FOR ME. I CAN FEEL LIKE A RAPIST OR A MURDERER. WELL, I'LL JUST GO CHECK ON MY BONER, SHALL I? AND, SADLY, IT WOULD BE THERE. ONE OF THE MORE PATHETIC THINGS IN THIS RELATIONSHIP, I THINK, WAS WATCHING AN UNOPENED BOX OF CONDOMS REACH ITS EXPIRATION DATE. 'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT BANANAS. THEY LAST A WHILE. EVENTUALLY I JUST STARTED BUYING, LIKE, ONE CONDOM FOR THE WHOLE YEAR. AND I'D KEEP IT UNDER A GLASS DOME, LIKE THE ROSE IN BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. IF THIS CONDOM EXPIRES, I SHALL FOREVER BE A BEAST! SOMEHOW MADE IT MAGICAL. BUT AS I WAS SAYING, I WAS WITH THIS WOMAN FOR 11 YEARS, UH, AND NEVER CHEATED ON HER IN THAT 11 YEARS. A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY, "WELL, YOU WANT A FUCKING MEDAL FOR NOT CHEATING ON YOUR WIFE?" YEAH, I'D KIND OF LIKE A MEDAL. I MEAN, A TROPHY, OR JUST WALK AROUND TOWN WITH A PURPLE SASH THAT SAYS "FUCKING GREAT GUY," 'CAUSE I EARNED IT. IT WAS NOT EASY. 11 FUCKING YEARS! IT WAS NOT EASY, 'CAUSE THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES, YOU KNOW? AND, UH, IN FACT, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT ONE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES, JUST TO TELL YOU HOW HARD IT WAS TO NOT CHEAT ON HER. ALL RIGHT, IT'S FIVE YEARS INTO THE RELATIONSHIP. I'M 25 YEARS OLD. SO, 25 YEARS OLD. FIVE YEARS WITHOUT BEING FUCKED. ALREADY A LIT FUSE. AND IT'S THE FIRST YEAR OF THE KIDS IN THE HALL SHOW, AND WE'RE SHOOTING A FILM PIECE FOR THE SHOW, AND OUR AGENT COMES DOWN TO THE SET, AND HE BRINGS A GUEST WITH HIM. AND THE GUEST THAT HE BRINGS TO SET IS UMA THURMAN. YEAH, IT'S ALREADY A GOOD STORY, BUT IT GETS BETTER BECAUSE UMA'S A KIDS IN THE HALL FAN, AND IT'S HER 19TH BIRTHDAY. SO THE KIDS IN THE HALL ARE GOING TO TAKE UMA THURMAN OUT FOR HER 19TH BIRTHDAY, HER FIRST NIGHT OF LEGAL DRINKING, 'CAUSE THAT'S THE DRINKING AGE IN CANADA. SO WE'RE TAKING UMA OUT, AND YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER, HISTORICALLY, WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW, 'CAUSE THIS IS '89. '88, DANGEROUS LIAISONS CAME OUT, AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE A FILM BUFF LIKE ME, IF YOU'RE A CINEASTE, UH, BUT IN THAT MOVIE, THAT'S WHERE WE MET UMA THURMAN, AND IN THAT MOVIE, THERE'S A SCENE IN THAT FILM WHERE SHE REMOVES HER NIGHTIE. AND FOR MEN OF MY GENERATION, THAT IS A J.F.K. MOMENT. THAT IS A MOMENT... EVERYTHING IS FROZEN IN TIME, BECAUSE UP TO THAT, SHE'S, LIKE, A GAWKY TEENAGE GIRL, THEN SHE TAKES THIS OFF, AND SHE'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL... NOT JUST WOMAN, BUT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING OR EVENT YOU'VE EVER SEEN. SHE'S BETTER THAN A SUNSET. SHE'S BETTER THAN A MOUNTAIN RANGE. SHE'S JUST UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL. SO THIS IS THE WOMAN THAT WE'RE TAKING OUT TO DINNER FOR HER 19TH BIRTHDAY, AND PEOPLE CAN'T GET OVER HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE IS. THEY'RE JUST AGOG. THEY'RE SLACK-JAWED, STARING AT HER. PEOPLE FOLLOWING US UP AND DOWN THE STREET. WHEN WE'RE EATING AT OUR RESTAURANT, PEOPLE ARE PLASTERED AGAINST THE WINDOW STARING AT HER. NO ONE CAN QUITE COPE WITH HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE IS. ALL RIGHT, NOW, THE EVENING WEARS ON. EVENTUALLY ALL THE OTHER KIDS IN THE HALL GO HOME, AND IT'S JUST ME AND UMA IN AN AFTER-HOURS BAR IN TORONTO AROUND 2:00, 3:00 IN THE MORNING, RIGHT? AND SHE'S INCREDIBLE. SHE'S SMART. SHE'S FUNNY. SHE'S GORGEOUS. AND WE'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME. AND WE'RE CUDDLED UP ON A COUCH, KIND OF, YOU KNOW. AND WE'RE FLIRTING, BUT AGAIN, IT'S SMART PEOPLE FLIRTING, 'CAUSE, LIKE, I'D READ THAT HER DAD WAS A PHILOSOPHER, SO IT'S LIKE, "I DO BELIEVE IMMANUEL KANT "ONCE SPINOZA'D KIERKEGAARD. I HOPE THAT MADE YOUR NIPPLES HARD." BUT THE EVENING GETS TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S CLEAR IT'S TIME TO SORT OF MOVE ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL, AND UMA'S GOING "WELL, SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?" AND I SORT OF GO, "I'M IN THIS RELATIONSHIP." AND I HEAR UMA SAY TO ME, "OH, WELL, I REALLY RESPECT THAT YOU'RE FAITHFUL TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND." THOSE WORDS HAVE HAUNTED ME EVER SINCE. THEY HAVE ECHOED IN MY HEAD EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE SINCE THEN, AND I GUARANTEE THIS RIGHT NOW... I GUARANTEE NOWHERE ON EARTH TONIGHT... NOWHERE ON EARTH TONIGHT, IS UMA THURMAN TELLING THIS STORY. IT HASN'T CROSSED HER MIND. THERE WAS NEVER A NIGHT WHEN SHE WAS IN BED WITH ETHAN HAWKE WHERE HE WOULD GO, "BABY, WHY SO DISTANT?" "OH, JUST THINKING ABOUT DAVE. JUST WONDERING WHAT MIGHT'VE BEEN." BUT I DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH A 19-YEAR-OLD UMA THURMAN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING, SIR? I DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH A 19-YEAR-OLD UMA THURMAN. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT! NONE OF YOU CAN SAY THAT! WELL, TECHNICALLY ALL OF YOU CAN SAY THAT, BUT FOR ME, I BELIEVE IT WAS AN OPTION! AND EVEN IF IT WASN'T REALLY AN OPTION, I BELIEVED IT IN MY HEART THAT IT WAS AN OPTION, AND I WALKED AWAY. AND I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT STORY INTO COURT AS EVIDENCE AGAINST MY FIRST WIFE. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY "YOUR HONOR, I WOULD LIKE TO HUMBLY SUBMIT I DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH A 19-YEAR-OLD UMA THURMAN." AND I THINK A REASONABLE COURT WOULD SAY, "WELL, TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT, "IT IS THE OPINION OF THIS COURT THAT, FUCK YOU! "THIS MAN OWES YOU NOTHING! "THIS GOOD AND NOBLE CREATURE. "WHY, WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A STATUE, AND BILL IT TO YOU, YOU CUNT." ODDLY ENOUGH, THAT ISN'T HOW IT WENT IN COURT. I WENT TO COURT WITH MY FIRST WIFE ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, AND I WAS THERE FOR AN ENFORCEMENT HEARING, AND THE ENFORCEMENT HEARING WAS THERE TO ENFORCE A PREVIOUS RULING. AND THE JUDGE IN THAT HEARING, HE RULED THAT I HAVE TO PAY MY FIRST WIFE $17,700 A MONTH. YEAH, OR GO TO JAIL. I HAVE AN OPTION. UH, SO, UH, SO I DON'T GO TO CANADA MUCH ANYMORE. BUT THE RULING THAT HE WAS ENFORCING WAS EVEN CRAZIER, 'CAUSE IT WAS AN EARLIER RULING WHERE I WENT TO GET MY PAYMENTS ADJUSTED, 'CAUSE WHEN MY SHOW NEWSRADIO WENT OFF THE AIR, MY CAREER BECAME SOMETHING CALLED SHITTY. SO I WENT TO COURT TO GET AN ADJUSTMENT, AND I LOST THE CASE. THE JUDGE RULED AGAINST ME. AND SHE DIDN'T RULE AGAINST ME BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT MY INCOME HAD CHANGED. THIS WOMAN... JUSTICE BACKHOUSE WAS THE JUDGE... SHE RULED THAT MY ABILITY TO PAY WAS NOT RELEVANT TO MY OBLIGATION TO PAY. YEAH, WHICH IS LIKE SAYING MY ABILITY TO FLY IS NOT RELEVANT TO MY OBLIGATION TO FLY. NOW, OFF THE ROOF YOU GO. OH! OH! WELL, HE'S IN VIOLATION OF THE RULING. OFFICER, ARREST THAT PUDDLE. SHE EVEN ACTUALLY... SHE DID ACTUALLY RULE THAT MY DEATH WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A MATERIAL CHANGE TO MY CIRCUMSTANCES. WHICH IS REALLY MORE OF A RELIGIOUS OPINION THAN A LEGAL ONE. SO I REALIZED, OKAY, SO IF I DIE, I HAVE TO KEEP WORKING, OR MY CORPSE GOES TO JAIL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY CORPSE CAN DO. MAYBE MY CORPSE CAN BE IN A BIG BROADWAY MUSICAL VERSION OF WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S. BUT I DON'T WANT MY CORPSE TO GO TO JAIL. THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT, 'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE THAT CORPSES ARE THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT ON THE PRISON RAPE TREE. PROBABLY... PROBABLY JUST BELOW DWARVES, YOU KNOW? AND I DON'T WANT MY CORPSE BEING RAPED. SORRY IF THAT'S EGOTISTICAL. DON'T WANT DWARVES RAPED, EITHER. THERE, I SAID IT. DON'T RAPE DWARVES, PRISONERS. SORRY IF THAT'S CONTROVERSIAL. I'LL BE AT A RALLY WITH PETER DINKLAGE NEXT WEEK. "STOP THE RAPING OF DWARVES!" IT'S A PROBLEM. NOW... WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN SINGLE, AND THEN MARRIED AGAIN... 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN MARRIED TWICE AND DIVORCED TWICE, 'CAUSE I LOVE PATTERNS. BUT WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED FOR A LONG TIME, THEN SINGLE, THEN MARRIED AGAIN, YOU SORT OF SEE THE SEXUAL WORLD IN IN THESE STARK SNAPSHOTS. IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED, YOU'RE IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION, AND THEN THEY WAKE YOU UP, AND EVERYONE'S WEARING JET PACKS, AND YOU'RE FREAKED OUT, AND THEY KNOCK YOU OUT AGAIN. AND AN EXAMPLE IS, UH, IS PUBIC HAIR. AND HEAR ME OUT ON THIS. UH, I'VE PUT SOME THOUGHT INTO THIS. BECAUSE I LOST MY VIRGINITY IN 1980, RIGHT? AND IN 1980, IT WAS A DIFFERENT WORLD. IN 1980, WOMEN JUST HAD PUBIC HAIR. THEY JUST FUCKING HAD IT. WHATEVER GREW, GREW, AND IT WAS LIKE IT WAS A NATIONAL PARK, AND IT WAS ILLEGAL TO CUT ANYTHING DOWN. JUST GREW. AND YOUNG MEN... YOUNG MEN HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOUNG MEN HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED... YOU'VE NEVER PROBABLY EXPERIENCED, LET'S CALL IT FREE RANGE PUBIC HAIR. YOU'VE NEVER FELT... YOU'VE NEVER FELT... YOU'VE NEVER FELT WET PUBES ON YOUR CHEEKS, YOU KNOW? IT WAS THE CLOSEST I'VE EVER COME TO HAVING MUTTON CHOPS. IT WAS AWESOME. AND YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW. YOU JUST DON'T KNOW. THEN I GOT MARRIED, AND I WAS MARRIED FOR 11 YEARS. I MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WELL THAT WENT, AND THEN I BECAME SINGLE IN THE '90s. AND IN THE '90s, WOMEN SUDDENLY HAD THE MOST METICULOUSLY MANICURED PUBIC HAIR. IT WAS AMAZING. IT WAS SUDDENLY LIKE WOMEN JUST HAD, LIKE, HAD, LIKE... EVERYONE HAD, LIKE, THE GARDENS OF VERSAILLES GROWING ON THEIR PUDENDUM. THERE'D BE, LIKE, ORNATE MAZES AND TOPIARY. THERE'D BE, LIKE, AN ELK JUST POSED MAJESTICALLY. LIKE, I DON'T KNOW HOW WOMEN DID ANYTHING ELSE IN THE '90s. MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE, "DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT TONIGHT?" "NO, SUMMER'S SIX MONTHS AWAY. I GOT TO WORK ON MY PUBES. I'LL NEVER BE READY." AND THEN I GOT MARRIED AGAIN, AND I WAS MARRIED FOR EIGHT YEARS. AND WHEN I BECAME SINGLE, UH, ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO, PUBIC HAIR WAS JUST GONE! IT WAS JUST FUCKING GONE! AND NOBODY WAS DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. EVERYBODY WAS FREAKING OUT ABOUT THE BEES DISAPPEARING, BUT NO ONE WAS DOING FUCK-ALL ABOUT THE PUBIC HAIR! WHAT IF IT'S AN INDICATOR SPECIES? WHAT IF THIS IS A SIGN OF AN ONCOMING ENVIRONMENTAL COLLAPSE? WHERE THE FUCK IS THE SIERRA CLUB? WHY ISN'T THE LORAX SPEAKING FOR THE PUBIC HAIR? AND MEN ARE SHAVING THEIR BALLS NOW. THAT'S SOMETHING MEN ARE DOING. I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF FRESHLY SHORN BALLS IN THE ROOM TONIGHT. MEN ARE SHAVING OFF THEIR PUBES, AND, YOU KNOW, IT STARTED... IT STARTED OUT WITH, LIKE... IT'S GAY PORN STARS STARTED IT, RIGHT? AND THEN STRAIGHT PORN STARS SAW THAT, WENT, "AWESOME! I'M GONNA DO THAT." AND THEN JUST REGULAR PEOPLE PICKED IT UP. SO YOU GOT, LIKE, A GUY DRIVING A GARBAGE TRUCK. HE'S GOT SHAVED BALLS. COP WRITING YOU A TICKET. HE'S GOT SHAVED BALLS. I SHAVED MY BALLS ONCE. I DID. I WAS... I SHAVED... I WAS DATING THIS GIRL WHO ASKED ME, WOULD I SHAVE 'EM? AND, FUCK IT, ALL RIGHT. I'LL TRY. AND IT WAS, UH... HORRIFYING, IS WHAT IT WAS. IT WAS HORRIFYING, 'CAUSE I DISCOVERED THAT I HAD FAT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT. I HAD PUBIC FAT. I HAD PUBIC FAT, AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT IT WAS FORMING THIS, LIKE, THIS RIDGE OVER MY COCK. IT WAS FORMING THIS, LIKE A CAVE. MY COCK LOOKED LIKE IT WAS LIVING IN A CAVE. MY COCK WAS, LIKE, POKING ITS HEAD OUT OF THE FAT CAVE. JUST POKING HIS HEAD OUT GOING, "WE DOING ANYTHING TONIGHT?" NO, WE'RE DOING FUCKING NOTHING TONIGHT. THIS SHIT GOES NOWHERE TILL THE HAIR COMES BACK. THE WORLD MUST NOT KNOW ABOUT MY FAT CAVE, COCK. I'M GOING TO TRUST YOU ON THIS ONE, COCK. DON'T LET ME DOWN THIS TIME. AND, APPARENTLY, THE RATIONALE FOR MEN SHAVING OFF THEIR PUBIC HAIR IS THAT IF YOU SHAVE OFF ALL YOUR PUBIC HAIR, IT'S SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOUR COCK LOOK BIGGER. RIGHT? UM... BUT I'M OF THE OPINION THAT AN OPTICAL ILLUSION DOWN THERE IS OF DUBIOUS VALUE. 'CAUSE I MEAN, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD, LIKE, TATTOO A FORCED PERSPECTIVE DRAWING OF A COUNTRY ROAD JUST WINDING OFF INTO THE DISTANCE WITH, LIKE, SOME MOUNTAINS OVER HERE AND A CITY SKYLINE. SEATTLE, LET'S MAKE IT SEATTLE. AND A WOMAN WOULD LOOK AT THAT AND GO, "OH, MY GOD, HIS COCK IS THE SIZE OF THE SPACE NEEDLE. I MUST HAVE IT!" BUT WHEN THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD, AS IT WERE, SIZE IS GOING TO MATTER. BECAUSE THE MOST YOU CAN REALLY HOPE TO ACHIEVE IS TO CONVINCE THE POOR WOMAN THAT SHE HAS A GIGANTIC VAGINA. SHE'S GOING, "MY GOD, IT LOOKED SO HUGE, AND I FEEL NOTHING. "WHAT KIND OF MONSTER AM I? OH, THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE THE CAT WENT." HERE'S THE DEAL. I THINK IT'S WEIRD THAT WE CAN HAVE PUBIC FASHIONS. THAT WE CAN HAVE TRENDS IN PUBIC HAIR. I THINK THAT'S ODD. I DON'T THINK THAT USED TO HAPPEN, YOU KNOW. I DON'T THINK THAT EVER HAPPENED IN THE '40s AND '50s. I DON'T THINK THEY HAD PUBIC TRENDS BACK THEN. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. I NEVER ASKED MY GRANDMOTHER. I SHOULD HAVE. SERIOUS. IT'S THE CONVERSATIONS WE DON'T HAVE THAT WE REGRET, PEOPLE. SO IF YOU TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM TONIGHT, TAKE THAT AWAY. PLEASE, TONIGHT WHEN YOU GET HOME, CALL YOUR GRANNY. ASK ABOUT HER PUBES. YOU'LL BE SURPRISED. "I DIDN'T THINK ANYBODY CARED. I LOVE YOU, SONNY." BUT IT'S TRUE. WE HAVE TRENDS IN PUBIC HAIR. AND I THINK THE REASON THAT CAN HAPPEN IS BECAUSE OF THE MAINSTREAMING OF PORN. AND THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THAT PORN, HARDCORE PORN, IS NOW MAINSTREAM. IT'S NOT A CULT THING. IT'S NOT A SUBCULTURE THING. EVERYONE'S BEEN EXPOSED TO HARDCORE PORN. IT USED TO BE IF YOU WANTED TO SEE, LIKE, HARDCORE PORN, YOU HAD TO MAKE AN EFFORT. YOU HAD TO DO THINGS LIKE, OH, LEAVE YOUR HOUSE. GO TO THE CREEPY PART OF TOWN. GO INTO SOME OLD, FILTHY THEATER. WADE THROUGH POOLS OF JIZZ. DEAL WITH SOME GUY MAKING, YOU KNOW, INTENSE AND INAPPROPRIATE EYE CONTACT, LIKE... "YOU AND ME ARE DOING THIS TOGETHER." THAT WAS THE PORN EXPERIENCE. IT'S NOT COMFORTABLE, IS IT, SIR? IT WAS A COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE. NOTHING PRIVATE ABOUT IT UNTIL HOME VIDEO CAME ALONG, RIGHT? AND THEN IT CHANGED. THEN, SUDDENLY, THE PORN EXPERIENCE WAS YOU'D GO TO YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, AND YOU'D, LIKE... YOU'D CIRCLE THE DISNEY SECTION FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS, WAITING FOR THE CROWD TO THIN OUT. AND THEN, WHEN YOUR MOMENT WAS RIGHT, YOU'D RUSH THROUGH THAT RATTY CURTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE PORN FROM THE DECENT FILMS, AND JUST GRAB UP AS MUCH PORN AS YOU COULD, AND THEN YOU'D TROT HOME WITH 'EM LIKE WILE E. COYOTE WITH HIS ACME SHIPMENT, AND JUST HOPE THAT YOU DIDN'T ACCIDENTALLY GRAB ALL GAY STUFF, 'CAUSE YOU'D MAKE DO. YOU'D GO, "I'LL PRETEND THAT ASSHOLE IS A VAGINA. "I'VE GOT WORK TO DO. CAN'T BE RUNNING BACK AND FORTH TO THE PORN STORE ALL NIGHT." BUT NOW IT'S JUST EVERYWHERE. PORN, IS JUST... IT'S IN OUR HOMES. YOU KNOW, IT COMES ON CABLE AND SATELLITE. IT'S THERE WAITING FOR YOU WHEN YOU GET HOME, LIKE A FAITHFUL DOG. IT'S LIKE, I CHECKED INTO MY HOTEL, RIGHT, AND I TURNED ON THE TV IN MY HOTEL, AND THE FIRST THING THE TV SAYS TO ME IS, "PLEASE CHECK OUT OUR ADULT SELECTIONS," WHICH IS PORN, IS WHAT IT IS. IT'S NOT MOVIES ABOUT PEOPLE BEHAVING PARTICULARLY MATURELY. IT'S NOT MOVIES ABOUT PEOPLE GOING, "YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO PUT MONEY ASIDE EVERY MONTH FOR RETIREMENT." TRY JERKING OFF TO THAT. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK. IT'S PORN. SO IT'S LIKE... WHEN THE HOTEL SAYS, "PLEASE CHECK OUT OUR ADULT SELECTIONS," IT'S LIKE THE SHERATON IS SAYING, "PLEASE JERK OFF IN OUR BEDS." AND I'M CANADIAN. YOU ASK ME NICELY, I WILL ACCOMMODATE. I ACCOMMODATED MY HOTEL SEVERAL TIMES TODAY. WHAT AM I GONNA DO? I GOT A DAY TO KILL. I DON'T WORK TILL NIGHT. AHH. ALL RIGHT, WELL, I FEEL LIKE... I FEEL LIKE WE'RE KIND OF GETTING ALONG PRETTY WELL AS AN AUDIENCE AND PERFORMER, RIGHT? WE'RE GETTING ALONG ALL RIGHT. PRETTY GOOD. SO IT'S PROBABLY TIME TO WRECK THAT. I'M GONNA TELL YOU... ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA... I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING PERSONAL NOW. THIS MAY CHANGE HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME. I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT. I... ALL RIGHT, I'LL JUST SAY IT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I'M SMART. OKAY, AND I KNOW THAT WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE SMART, I KNOW THAT A WAVE OF HOSTILITY CAN GO THROUGH THE ROOM, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE BEING SMART'S NOT VERY POPULAR IN OUR CULTURE ANYMORE. IT'S KIND OF FROWNED UPON. WE'RE LIVING IN THE POST-, YOU KNOW, JACKASS WORLD. YOU KNOW, THE WORST THING YOU CAN CALL SOMEONE IN OUR CULTURE RIGHT NOW IS AN INTELLECTUAL ELITE. THAT'S THE WORST INSULT YOU CAN LEVEL, TO CALL SOMEONE AN INTELLECTUAL ELITE. WHICH IS WEIRD TO ME BECAUSE WE DON'T FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT THE PHYSICALLY ELITE. WE DON'T RESENT THEM FOR BEING BETTER THAN US AT THE GAMES THEY PLAY. THAT'S THE FUN IN WATCHING THEM, YOU KNOW? LIKE, NO ONE EVERY SAID, "DO YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE "ABOUT KOBE BRYANT? "HE PLAYS BASKETBALL JUST LIKE ME. "HE GETS WINDED EASY, CAN'T HIT THE BACKBOARD, "SHOWS UP DRUNK MOST OF THE TIME. "HE'S AWESOME. I NEVER FEEL THREATENED WHEN I WATCH HIM PLAY." BUT THAT'S HOW WE FEEL ABOUT THE INTELLECTUALLY ELITE. WE FEEL THREATENED BY THEM. WE DON'T LIKE IT. IT MAKES US ANGRY. PEOPLE SAY THAT'S THE REASON THAT BARACK OBAMA HAS TROUBLE, YOU KNOW, CONNECTING WITH ORDINARY PEOPLE, AND BY THE WAY, THANK GOD HE GOT REELECTED. THANK FUCKING GOD. REALLY, YES. THAT WAS TERRIFYING. THAT WAS TERRIFYING. I WAS SO TENSE. I DON'T THINK I SHIT FOR A YEAR. I WAS SO CLENCHED WAITING FOR THIS ELECTION TO END. BUT HE'S BACK. BUT PEOPLE STILL SAY HE... THAT HE'S CONSIDERED... HE SEEMS TOO MUCH OF AN INTELLECTUAL, SO PEOPLE CAN'T RELATE TO HIM. YEAH, IT'S LIKE, "HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE BIG OL' BRAINY-BRAIN, OBAMA? "ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS RUN THE FUCKING COUNTRY. IT DOESN'T TAKE AN EINSTEIN." BUT, LIKE, IF EINSTEIN WAS STARTING HIS CAREER IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, IN AMERICA, I THINK HE WOULD FEEL COMPELLED TO PREFACE HIS EVERY STATEMENT WITH, "HEY, I'M NO GENIUS, BUT..." IT WOULD'VE BEEN, HEY, I'M NO GENIUS, BUT I GOT AN ITCHY OL' FEELING IN THE BACK OF MY NOGGIN. MAYBE "E" EQUALS "M-C" SQUARED. BUT WHAT DO I KNOW? I'M JUST AN OLD COUNTRY BOY. LIKE, THERE ARE SCIENTISTS RIGHT NOW WORKING AT CERN, RIGHT, WITH A LARGE HADRON COLLIDER. AND THEY'RE DOING EXPERIMENTS THAT MAY HAVE ALREADY YIELDED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY, YOU KNOW. BUT THEY'RE STILL FOLLOWING IT UP, RIGHT? AND LITERALLY, A FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERY ABOUT THE VERY NATURE OF REALITY. BUT IF THEY WANT TO ANNOUNCE IT WITHOUT ALIENATING EVERYBODY, THEY BETTER DO IT AS, "HEY, WE WERE JUST FUCKING AROUND WITH A COLLIDER, RIGHT? "WE THOUGHT, WHY DON'T WE COLLIDE A COUPLE PROTON BEAMS "HERE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT, SEE WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENS? "AND WE DID IT, AND IT WAS FUCKING AWESOME! "AND WE DISCOVERED THE HIGGS BOSON. "NOW WE KNOW WHY MATTER HAS MASS, BUT FUCK IT. LET'S GO TO A TITTY BAR." I THINK IT'S... IT'S THAT ANTI-INTELLECTUAL MINDSET THAT I THINK MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE LIKE A GEORGE BUSH TO BECOME PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW, OR SOMEONE LIKE A SARAH PALIN TO, I DON'T KNOW, GET A FUCKING DRIVER'S LICENSE. FUCK, I HATE HER. I HATE SARAH PALIN SO MUCH. OH, I HATE HER. OH, I HATE HER SO MUCH. BUT SHE'S HOT, AND I WOULD TOTALLY FUCK HER. I WOULD... I WOULD TOTALLY... I'M NOT MAKING THE UMA MISTAKE TWICE, PEOPLE. OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF, THERE WILL BE SOME PALIN FUCKING GOING ON. BUT I'LL FEEL BADLY ABOUT IT, AS A LIBERAL. I'LL FEEL BADLY. I'LL DEFINITELY HAVE TO LIE TO MY FRIENDS. I'LL HAVE TO... HAVE TO CLAIM, LIKE, I THOUGHT IT WAS TINA FEY, UH, JUST... IT'S... AND IT WAS WEIRD, DUDE. SHE WOULDN'T BREAK CHARACTER, MAN. SHE WAS ALL JUST, "WE THE PEOPLE," THEN SOME GIBBERISH AND DROOLING. BUT FUCK IT. SHE'S A COMIC GENIUS, AND I WANT TO BE ON 30 ROCK, SO I DID IT. BUT I'LL TELL YOU, YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE? I LOVE SCIENCE. I LOVE SCIENCE. I THINK SCIENCE IS AMAZING. SCIENCE, I THINK, IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS OUR SPECIES HAS EVER DONE. SCIENCE, IT'S JUST FUCKING AWESOME. AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE SCIENCE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO REALLY ARE SUSPICIOUS OF IT AND RESENT IT, PEOPLE LIKE MICHELLE BACHMANN AND SARAH PALIN, YOU KNOW, WHO JUST DO NOT TRUST IT AT ALL. THEY DON'T TRUST SCIENCE. THEY THINK IT'S SOMEHOW CONSPIRING AGAINST THEM AND THEIR BELIEFS, AND... AND THEY LOVE TO COME UP WITH SORT OF PSEUDO-SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTS TO SHOOT SCIENCE DOWN. YOU KNOW, THEY LOVE SAYING THINGS LIKE, "ALL THE SCIENCE ISN'T IN ON THAT." THAT'S A FAVORITE PHRASE AMONG STUPID PEOPLE. ALL THE SCIENCE ISN'T IN ON THAT, LIKE ALL THE SCIENCE IS EVER IN ON ANYTHING. LIKE THERE'S EVER A TIME WHEN SCIENTISTS JUST GO, "WELL, WE'RE DONE OUR SCIENCIN'. "THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH. "JUST TAKE IT. DO WHAT YOU WILL WITH IT. BACK TO THE TITTY BAR FOR US." THAT'S NOT HOW SCIENCE WORKS. SCIENCE IS AN ONGOING PROCESS. SCIENCE IS NEVER ALL IN, LIKE YOU SAY, SCIENCE ISN'T ALL IN ON GLOBAL WARMING. YEAH, 'CAUSE ONLY 99.999% OF THE WORLD'S SCIENTISTS AGREE THAT IT IS MAN-MADE, SO UNTIL ALL THE SCIENCE IS IN, I SAY WE JUST SET FIRE TO ANYTHING THAT'LL BURN. THAT'S WHAT WE GOTTA DO. THAT'S... GOD MADE IT... GOD WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT FLAMMABLE IF HE DIDN'T WANT US TO BURN IT. THAT GOES FOR YOU, FAT BILLY. WE'RE GOING TO BURN YOU. SORRY. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT. THEY SAY THINGS LIKE, UH, YOU KNOW, LIKE "THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION". THEY LOVE TO SAY THAT THAT'S JUST A THEORY. IT'S NOT THE FACT OF EVOLUTION. IT'S THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION. THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT A THEORY. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS A THEORY? GRAVITY. YEAH, GRAVITY'S JUST A FUCKING THEORY. THEY HAVEN'T DISCOVERED THE GRAVITON, THE PARTICLE THAT CONVEYS GRAVITY TO MATTER. THEY HAVEN'T COME UP WITH THAT. THEY HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET, AND UNTIL THEY DO, I THINK IT'S ALL JUNK SCIENCE. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S ALL A NEWTONIAN HOAX. AN EINSTEINIAN BOONDOGGLE, I CALLS IT. TILL ALL THE SCIENCE IS IN ON GRAVITY, I REFUSE TO BE A SLAVE TO IT. WHY, WHEN I'M ON THE 15th FLOOR AND I NEED TO GET TO THE GROUND, I JUST STEP OUT A WINDOW. DOING ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE GIVING IN TO LEFT-WING MEDIA HYSTERIA. SCIENCE HAS ONLY RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT 95% OF OUR UNIVERSE IS UNACCOUNTED FOR. I MEAN, THAT BOGGLES MY... 95% OF THE UNIVERSE IS COMPLETELY MYSTERIOUS. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS OR WHERE IT IS. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE CALLING IT, YOU KNOW, DARK MATTER AND DARK ENERGY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS. THEY JUST KNOW IT HAS TO BE THERE, 'CAUSE OTHERWISE, THE LAWS OF PHYSICS DON'T WORK, BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS. THAT'S ASTONISHING. 95% OF EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE A COMPLETE MYSTERY. BUT I WAS THINKING, LIKE, BUT WHAT IF... WHAT IF SOMEWHERE OUT THERE, THERE WERE CREATURES MADE OF THIS DARK STUFF? YOU KNOW, WHAT IF THERE ARE... THERE ARE RACES MADE OF DARK MATTER? AND WHAT IF THEIR SCIENTISTS ARE LOOKING AT THEIR UNIVERSE, AND THEY'RE GOING, "OH, MY GOD, 5% OF THE UNIVERSE IS MISSING. FUCK IT. I CAN LIVE WITH THAT." FUCKING DARK MATTER PEOPLE, THEY DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT THE 5% OF THE UNIVERSE THAT IS EVERYTHING TO US. THEY'RE SO FUCKING ARROGANT, THOSE DARK MATTER PEOPLE. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY? I SAY FUCK YOU, DARK MATTER PEOPLE. MAYBE THE UNIVERSE IS A LOT LIKE AUSTRALIA, AND 95% OF IT IS JUST SHIT. YEAH, MAYBE WE GOT ALL THE COASTLINE OF THE UNIVERSE, AND YOU GOT THE FUCKING OUTBACK. FUCKING DARK MATTER ASSHOLES. YEAH, YOU TELL 'EM I SAID SO. BUT AS A SPECIES, UH, WE JUST LIKE KNOWING THINGS. IT'S JUST IN OUR DNA THAT... WHICH, IF... YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE IN... UH... THAT WE JUST WANT TO KNOW THINGS. WE WANT TO KNOW THINGS EVEN IF THERE'S NO REASON TO KNOW THEM, IF THERE'S NO USEFUL PURPOSE IN KNOWING IT. WE JUST WANT TO KNOW THINGS. AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS A STUDY THAT A GROUP OF SOUTH KOREAN SCIENTISTS DID, UM, WHERE THEY... THEY FOUND A CORRELATION... THIS IS A TRUE STORY. I READ THIS IN THE L.A. TIMES. UH, THEY DID A STUDY WHERE THEY FOUND A CORRELATION BETWEEN, UH, THE RELATIVE LENGTH OF YOUR RING FINGER AND YOUR INDEX FINGER AND PENIS SIZE. THEY FOUND THAT IF YOUR RING FINGER IS LONGER THAN YOUR INDEX FINGER, THAT THAT WAS AN INDICATION OF A LARGER PENIS. AND I'LL JUST TAKE A MOMENT FOR ALL THE MEN TO CHECK OUT THEIR HANDS. AND WHILE THEY'RE DOING THAT, I'LL LET THE LADIES CHECK OUT MY HAND. CHECK IT OUT, LADIES. LOOK AT THAT. THAT IS ONE LANKY MOTHERFUCKER OF A RING FINGER, LADIES. I'M JUST SAYING. IT'S SCIENCE. AND THE STUDY THAT THEY DID... THEY WERE UROLOGICAL SURGEONS. THEY HAD LIKE 140 PATIENTS THAT WERE BOOKED TO COME IN FOR UROLOGICAL SURGERY, RIGHT? AND THEY BROUGHT THEM IN, ANESTHETIZED THEM, AND PROCEEDED TO MEASURE THEIR FINGERS AND DICKS. AND... FIRST, SHOULD THEY BE DOING THIS, FIRST OFF? 'CAUSE YOU GO IN FOR SURGERY, YOU KINDA WANT TO HOPE THE DOCTOR'S TAKING IT SERIOUSLY, THAT HE'S NOT GONNA FUCK AROUND WITH YOUR DICK FOR 20 MINUTES OUT OF SOME WEIRD CURIOSITY. BUT THEY DID THIS. THEY MEASURED THEIR FINGERS AND THEIR PENISES, AND THEY MEASURED THE PENISES FLACCID, 'CAUSE, WELL, SERIOUSLY, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? UM, BUT THEY... BUT THEY ALSO MEASURED THEM... THEY WERE ANESTHETIZED. UM, THEY ALSO MEASURED THEM, UH... AND I'M QUOTING... "STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT." BECAUSE THEY SAID... IN THE STUDY, THEY SAID THIS... THAT IT IS BELIEVED THAT STRETCHING A PENIS TO ITS LIMIT APPROXIMATES ERECT PENIS LENGTH. BUT IT'S JUST A THEORY AT THIS POINT. ALL THE SCIENCE ISN'T IN ON THIS ONE. WE NEED TO DO A LOT MORE PEER-REVIEWED PENIS STRETCHING BEFORE IT'S A HARD FACT. RIGHT? LIKE, HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU'VE STRETCHED A PENIS TO ITS LIMIT, UNLESS YOU HAVE AT SOME POINT STRETCHED ONE PAST ITS LIMIT? UNLESS YOU JUST RIPPED ONE THE FUCK OFF, AND IT'S LIKE, "DO WE STILL MEASURE THIS ONE?" NO, WE DON'T FUCKING MEASURE IT! OH, AND YOU'VE RUINED THE SAMPLE SIZE. NOW NO ONE'S GOING TO TAKE MY PENIS STUDY SERIOUSLY. I'LL NEVER GET OUT OF SOUTH KOREA. I'M AFRAID OF MUSLIMS. I MEAN, NOT ALL MUSLIMS. OBVIOUSLY, THAT WOULD BE... THAT WOULD BE WRONG. UH, I'M AFRAID OF, UH... IT MIGHT BE A SMALL GROUP OF MUSLIMS THAT I'M AFRAID OF. I'M NOT SURE. MIGHT EVEN BE JUST, LIKE, ONE MUSLIM THAT I'M AFRAID OF. UM, I'M AFRAID OF THE MUSLIM WHO MIGHT HEAR ME TELL A JOKE TONIGHT AND THEN SAY TO HIMSELF, "HEY, WOULDN'T IT BE COOL TO KILL HIM?" THAT MUSLIM SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF ME, 'CAUSE HE'S OUT THERE. HE'S DEFINITELY OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. I MEAN, THERE WAS A GUY WHO WAS PLOTTING TO MURDER MATT STONE AND TREY PARKER, THE PRODUCERS OF SOUTH PARK, BECAUSE THEY PUT MOHAMMED IN A BEAR SUIT ON AN EPISODE OF SOUTH PARK, WHICH WAS THEIR WAY OF AVOIDING DEPICTING THE PROFIT MOHAMMED, WHICH SHOWS THEY'RE ALSO AFRAID OF MUSLIMS. ALL COMEDIANS ARE. ALL... MUSLIM COMEDIANS ARE AFRAID OF OTHER MUSLIMS, RIGHT? 'CAUSE, LIKE, I WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU A JOKE ABOUT MOHAMMED TONIGHT, UH, BUT I WON'T, 'CAUSE I'M A-SCARED TO. JUST TOO AFRAID TO DO IT. BUT I CAN SAY THE MOST OFFENSIVE THING I CAN THINK OF ABOUT JESUS CHRIST TONIGHT. IT'S TRUE. I CAN SAY... I CAN SAY, JESUS CHRIST WAS A PEDOPHILE. HE WAS... WITH HALITOSIS. HE WAS A PEDOPHILE WITH HALITOSIS. LIKE, THAT'S WHAT THE KIDS WOULD OBJECT TO. THEY WOULD SAY, "JESUS, WE DON'T MIND THE RAPIN' SO MUCH, "BUT FOR FUCK'S SAKES, FLOSS OCCASIONALLY. YOUR MOUTH SMELLS LIKE ASS." NOW, I CAN SAY THAT, AND I WILL AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT'S PRETTY OFFENSIVE. BUT I CAN SAY THAT TONIGHT, AND THEN I CAN LEAVE HERE, AND I CAN WALK HOME THROUGH THE MOST DANGEROUS CHRISTIAN NEIGHBORHOOD IN TOWN AND LIVE. I CAN LIVE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING, AS A CULTURE, THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF. WE CAN BE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOTTEN TO A POINT IN OUR HISTORY WHERE WE CAN HEAR SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HORRIBLY OFFEND US, BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO MURDER THE PERSON WHO SAID IT. WE COULD SATISFY OURSELVES WITH A HEARTY TSK, TSK. YOU KNOW, WE DON'T THINK GOD NEEDS US TO HAVE HIS BACK. GOD ISN'T IN HEAVEN GOING, "DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID? "DID YOU? AND YOU JUST SAT THERE? YOU JUST... YOU DON'T LOVE ME!" GOD LOCKS HIMSELF IN THE BATHROOM ALL NIGHT. THAT'S A FUCKING SHITTY GOD. BUT WE DON'T... YEAH, WE DON'T. WE'VE GOTTEN A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG, RIGHT? WE CAN BE PROUD OF THAT, BUT WE SHOULDN'T GET SMUG ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW? WE SHOULDN'T GET SMUG ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT BETTER THAN THE ISLAMIC WORLD. WE'RE JUST SLIGHTLY FURTHER DOWN THE EXACT SAME ROAD, RIGHT? 'CAUSE YOU GOT TO BEAR IN MIND THAT CHRISTIANITY HAD A 600-YEAR HEAD START ON ISLAM, RIGHT? SO YOU WIND THE CLOCK BACK 600 YEARS ON CHRISTIANITY, AND I'M A STANDUP COMEDIAN WORKING DURING THE INQUISITION. I JUST MIGHT SKIP MY JESUS BIT. I MIGHT GO STRAIGHT TO MY WITCHES BE CRAZY MATERIAL. YEAH, WHITE WITCHES ARE ALL "BLAH, BLAH, BLAH." BLACK WITCHES ARE ALL "OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T." SO WE'RE NOT BETTER. WE'RE JUST FURTHER DOWN THE EXACT SAME ROAD, RIGHT? AHH. I'M NOT A RACIST. I SAY THAT JUST IN CASE I'M WRONG. UM... AND I KNOW RACISM IS COOL AGAIN. I KNOW IT'S BACK. UM... WE GOT A BLACK PRESIDENT, SO NOW IT'S OKAY TO BE RACIST AGAIN. UM, AND I GUESS, YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE, I MEAN, IT'S PROBABLY FUN BEING A RACIST, YOU KNOW, HANGING OUT WITH YOUR RACIST BUDDIES, SINGING DOO-WOP SONGS, AND SAYING THE "N" WORD, UH, WHICH IS NIGGER, BY THE WAY. UM, I DON'T KNOW IF... IS ANYONE HERE NOT IN ON... IN ON... ANYONE NOT KNOW THAT? THAT'S... IT'S... THAT'S WHAT IT IS. IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW... ANYONE HERE NOT IN ON THE CODE? UH, IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S PARTICULARLY GOOD CODE. IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S... NOT LIKE IT'S ALGEBRA. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S... UNLESS, OF COURSE, THE EQUATION IS, IF "S" EQUALS SOCIAL DISCOMFORT AND "L" EQUALS LIBERAL WHITE GUILT, THEN "N" IS NIGGER. 'CAUSE THE ONLY TIME YOU EVER HEAR ANYONE SAY THE PHRASE "THE 'N' WORD" IS WHEN THEY WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE THEY HEARD SAY NIGGER, AND THEY WANT TO TELL YOU HOW OFFENDED THEY WERE AND WHAT GOOD PEOPLE THEY ARE FOR BEING OFFENDED. SO THEY'LL BE LIKE, "YEAH, ME AND MY BUDDY WERE OUT "THE OTHER NIGHT, AND WE JUST... "WE HEARD THIS GUY SAYING THE 'N' WORD. "WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. "HE WAS JUST SAYING IT, JUST SAYING THE 'N' WORD. "WE COULDN'T... WE COULD... WELL, I DID THE ONLY THING "I COULD DO. "I GAVE MY FRIEND A LOOK. I WENT... "I MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR I DISAPPROVED. "I FELT LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. THAT NIGHT. I WAS A DIFFERENCE-MAKER." 'CAUSE...'CAUSE IT'S LIKE PEOPLE WHO SAY, UH, "SUGAR" WHEN THEY MEAN SHIT AND THEY THINK THAT MAKES THEM NICE PEOPLE, AND IT DOESN'T, 'CAUSE WE KNOW YOU MEAN SHIT. WE KNOW YOU MEAN SHIT BECAUSE NO ONE EVER GOT THAT UPSET ABOUT STEPPING IN A PILE OF SUGAR. NO ONE EVER SAID, "WHY IS THIS STEAMING PILE "OF SUGAR HERE? OH, IT'S IN MY FAVORITE SHOES "WITH THE DEEP, INTRICATE TREAD. I'LL NEVER GET IT OUT. "MM, MM. OH, WELL. I'LL JUST LICK MY SHOE. AGH, LAH, LAH, MMM." OR, WHAT SHOULD BE THE MOST OFFENSIVE SUBSTITUTION, UH, IF YOU BELIEVE IN GOD, WHICH, AGAIN, IS CRAZY, BUT IF YOU DO, UH, IS GOSH DARN. THAT SHOULD BE THE MOST OFFENSIVE PHRASE ON EARTH. 'CAUSE THAT IMPLIES THAT YOU CAN TRICK GOD. LIKE GOD'S TOO FUCKING THICK TO FIGURE IT OUT. LIKE GOD'LL BE THERE JUST GOING... WHAT WAS THAT? OH, OH, OH, GOSH DARN. I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID SOMETHING ELSE. I'M SORRY. I WAS GONNA CONDEMN YOU TO HELL FOR ETERNITY. OH, MY GOD. OH. THAT WAS... THAT WAS GOSH DARN. I DON'T EVEN... I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. I DON'T EVEN THINK THOSE ARE WORDS, FRANKLY. I MEAN... OH, I BETTER GET THESE OLD EARS CHECKED OUT, I GUESS. I DON'T... MIGHT WANNA GET SOME THERAPY. WHY AM I SO QUICK TO ANGER? UGH. I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE BECAUSE I NEVER HAD A FATHER. I KNOW THAT'S WHY I CAN'T RELATE TO MY SON. GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS BULLSHIT. "OH, FATHER, WHY HAS THOU FORSAKEN ME?" OH, GROW A PAIR, WHY DON'T YOU, JESUS? BUT THE "N" WORD WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT, AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE BAD WORDS, YOU KNOW, WHICH I DON'T THINK IS TRUE. I DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THERE TO BE BAD WORDS, BECAUSE WORDS DON'T HAVE A CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. THEY CAN'T TAKE INDEPENDENT ACTION OR MAKE ETHICAL OR MORAL DECISIONS. THEY'RE JUST NOISES WE MAKE. THEY'RE JUST NOISES THAT WE MAKE WITH OUR MOUTHS, AND THEN WE ALL GET TOGETHER AS A SOCIETY AND AGREE ON WHAT EACH NOISE MEANS. WE GO, "THIS NOISE MEANS CHAIR. SIT DOWN, RELAX." THAT'S HOW LANGUAGE WORKS. SO WHEN YOU SAY "THE 'N' WORD," EVERYBODY STILL HEARS "NIGGER" IN THEIR HEAD, RIGHT? SO ALL YOU'VE DONE IS MADE EVERYONE ELSE RESPONSIBLE FOR HEARING IT. AND THAT'S PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE, AND STOP IT. 'CAUSE IT'S ABOUT INTENTIONS. IT'S NOT JUST THE MEANINGS OF THE WORDS, 'CAUSE, LIKE, IF ALL YOU HEAR ARE THE WORDS I SAY AND NOT WHAT I SAY WITH THOSE WORDS, THEN WE CAN'T COMMUNICATE, RIGHT? 'CAUSE YOU CAN SAY THE WORD. YOU CAN SAY THE DREADED WORD WITHOUT ME NECESSARILY THINKING YOU BELIEVE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE THING TO CALL ANOTHER HUMAN BEING, 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK IT IS. ALL RIGHT? BUT I CAN HEAR SOMEONE SAY, "I HEARD THIS PIECE OF SHIT GOING ON AND ON "ABOUT THE TROUBLE WITH THE NIGGERS. WHAT A PIECE OF SHIT THAT GUY WAS." I CAN HEAR THAT AND THEN, LIKE SHERLOCK HOLMES, FIGURE OUT FROM THE CONTEXT, MAYBE YOU'RE NOT A RACIST. BUT CONVERSELY, IF YOU SHOUT, "HEY, YOU 'N' WORD, GET AWAY FROM THAT WHITE LADY!" THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE SENTIMENT OKAY. 'CAUSE IT'S ABOUT YOUR INTENTIONS WITH THE WORDS. IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU WANT THE WORDS TO BE HEARD AND INTERPRETED, NOT THE WORDS THEMSELVES. 'CAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO THINK THAT WE COULD REALLY DEAL A BLOW TO RACISM BY JUST ALL SAYING "THE 'N' WORD." THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC. I'D BE ALL FOR IT. AND WE COULD JUST MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE, RIGHT? BE LIKE... LIKE LET'S DEAL WITH VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN. OKAY, FROM NOW ON, UH, RAPE WILL BE THE "R" WORD. OH, RETARDS ALREADY GOT THAT? FUCK. SORRY, LADIES. THE VIOLENCE CONTINUES. WE DID ALL WE COULD. WE CHANGED THE WORD. BUT THE "N" WORD. SO IT'S... IT'S ABOUT THIS CONFUSION BETWEEN INTENTION AND MEANING. AND I THINK, UH, A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT WAS WHEN A PUBLISHING HOUSE DECIDED THEY WERE GONNA PUBLISH A VERSION OF THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL HUCKLEBERRY FINN, UH, WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO, UH, REMOVE EVERY USAGE OF THE WORD "NIGGER" IN THE BOOK, UH, BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SELL THE BOOK TO THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF THIS, RIGHT? WE USED TO STUDY IT IN SCHOOLS, BUT WE DON'T ANYMORE BECAUSE TEACHERS DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANGRY PARENTS COMING IN AND SAYING, "WHY DOES MY CHILD HAVE TO READ THIS HORRIBLE WORD?" AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CHILDREN ASKING QUESTIONS AND INADVERTENTLY BECOMING EDUCATED. SO SOMEONE HAD THE BRILLIANT IDEA OF, WHY DON'T WE JUST... JUST TAKE THE WORD OUT? WE TAKE THE WORD OUT, AND WE CAN SELL SOME FUCKING BOOKS. WE'LL TAKE IT OUT. AND I SORT OF SYMPATHIZE, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, BECAUSE, I MEAN, THE WORD, YOU KNOW, HAS A LOT OF UGLY CONNOTATIONS TO IT. THE WORD HAS BEEN USED TO... TO DEMEAN AND DEHUMANIZE AND DIMINISH OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THERE'S A LOT OF UGLINESS CONNECTED TO THE WORD. SO I UNDERSTAND THE... THE DESIRE, RIGHT? SO THEY SAID, ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE THE WORD OUT BECAUSE OF ITS CONNOTATIONS, AND WE'LL REPLACE IT WITH "SLAVE." BECAUSE "SLAVE" HAS ONLY POSITIVE CONNOTATIONS. AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, NEXT TIME YOU SEE AN ANGRY-LOOKING BLACK GUY, JUST SHOUT OUT TO HIM, "WHAT UP, MY SLAVE?" YOU WATCH HIS FACE LIGHT UP. AND, UH, AND JUST BEFORE I GO, I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY. I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT THE FIRST TIME THAT I EVER DID THAT BIT, THE BIT I JUST DID. UH, I'LL CALL IT THE "N" WORD BIT. I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND ANYBODY. UM... THE FIRST TIME I DID IT, IT WAS ONE OF MY FIRST ROAD GIGS, UM, WHEN I STARTED DOING STANDUP AGAIN. AND I DID IT IN, UH, IN ST. LOUIS. female audience member: I KNOW, I KNOW. REMEMBER EARLIER, WHEN I SAID I WAS SMART? THAT WAS A JOKE. I'M NOT VERY SMART. I'M NOT VERY SMART. BUT I DID IT IN ST. LOUIS, AND, UM, AND LITERALLY 2/3 OF THE AUDIENCE WALKED OUT. 2/3 OF THE AUDIENCE WALKED OUT. AND IT STARTED WITH, LIKE, THIS... THE FIRST TIME THE WORD "NIGGER" DROPPED FROM MY LIPS, SOMEBODY JUST LEAPT UP AND WENT, "AAH! BWAH! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!" AND ONCE ONE PERSON DOES THAT, THEN EVERYBODY ELSE FIGURES, WELL, I'D BETTER "BWAH-WHOA" MY WAY OUT TOO. I DON'T WANT PEOPLE THINKING I'M ON HIS SIDE. SO THEY KEPT LEAVING, AND EVENTUALLY, IT WAS JUST ME AND ALL THE BLACK PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE STARING AT EACH OTHER, GOING, "I DON'T KNOW." AND... ONE WOMAN... ONE WOMAN WAS SO OFFENDED, SHE WENT OUT INTO THE LOBBY, AND SHE JUST KEPT SCREAMING, "HE CAN'T SAY NIGGER! "HE CAN'T SAY NIGGER! NO! HE CAN'T SAY NIGGER!" UNTIL EVENTUALLY, THE MANAGER HAD TO COME UP TO HER AND SAY, "MADAM, WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP SCREAMING NIGGER IN OUR LOBBY?" AND THAT MADE ME VERY HAPPY. AS HAVE ALL OF YOU TONIGHT. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN FABULOUS. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN GREAT. LET IT GO. IT'S GONNA GO ALL THE WAY! OH!
