My dear, my love I have lost you My child, my jewel Being apart causes me a heartache I cry a river of tears Missing you Through the windows I looked at the babies I just want to get closer But they fret and I leave I cry a river of tears Missing you Oh, why Why did you pull the nail out of me? Give it back to me The cries from the cradle The vengeance in my heart I will hunt all the men With my claws and fangs I cry a river of tears Missing you THE RETURN OF THE PONTIANAK - Run! - Run quickly! Villagers, listen here. When we see her, we must kill her! - Yes, kill her! - Yes! - We'll kill her! - Yes! - If you're with me, let's go! - Kill her! - Let's set out! - Kill her! - Let's go! Kill her! - Let's kill her! Over there! - After her! There she is! - Where? - Dollah! - What? - Chase after her! - What is it? - We need to catch up to them. - I need to pee. You're very troublesome, go quickly! I'll go with them. Wait, Dollah. Can you come with me? My gosh. Fine, hurry up. Go over there! Dollah. I'm scared, Dollah. Hey. What kind of a man are you to be scared of this? Hey, Dollah's here, so don't worry. Seriously. It's a worm. What the hell? You tell me not to be scared, but you are scaring me. The worm startled me. Dollah. Do you feel anything? I feel like… I feel like there's something behind us. I know. I'm getting goosebumps. My hand too. Let's take a look. Let's do it together. Thank God, there's nothing. You're scaring me. Mom! Help me! Take a look. What did you see? I didn't see anything! Let's take a look. Hi. What's wrong with you? You're embarrassing me. Why did you carry me like that? I told him many times to not carry me. Miss, where are you going? You're pretty. That's not it. You're very pretty. Are you alone? If you're all alone, you might get lost. Let me help you. I can also help you. Let me help. Let me help you. I'm looking for my baby. What are you looking for? - Your baby? - Baby? Give us a second. It's okay, let's help her since she's pretty. You'll help her just because she's pretty? Wait for a moment. - All right, we'll help you. - I'll help you. Quick. Wait for us. Quickly. This way, please. What's with you? What's that sound? It's a baby. Don't say it! Let's go. Excuse me. Miss, why is it so far? What are you doing there? Have you found your baby? Miss. What are you looking for? Miss, what are you doing over there? - What's that sound? - Over there! - Over there! - Let's go! - Killer! - Burn! Through the windows I looked at the babies I just want to get closer But they fret and I leave I cry a river of tears Missing you Oh, why Why did you pull the nail out of me? That's your scene. - He can do it too. - It's okay. For this particular scene, what you should do is, you should move the camera. - Okay. - Right? - And try... - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi. How are you? - Nice meeting you. - How is it going? - Fine. - I'm fine. - Are you here to support us? - Yes. - Can we go to one side? - Sure. - It's okay. - See you later. See you later. Take care. - Yes. - That's right. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Good job. - Good job. - Thank you. - Good job. Thank you. Good job and well done. Okay, let's do it. Sound. Camera. Action. My dear, my love I have lost you My child, my jewel Being apart causes me a heartache I cry a river of tears Missing you Through the windows I looked at the babies I just want to get closer But they fret and I leave I cry a river of tears Missing you Oh, why Why did you pull the nail out of me? Give it back to me The cries from the cradle Look. When you see these questions, you have to be careful. Because there are so many traps within that you can easily fall into and will kill you before you know it. Look. Here's another trap. But for me, these questions are a piece of cake. Look carefully, I'm going to use my ultimate move. For the first question, you have to minus three. Then add this number. Move this, add this, and do this. This is a trap. So how do you deal with this? Deduct this and move it to the front. Lastly, you have to remove this number. The answer is this. Okay? I finally found you, little brat! - Damn it! - Don't run! - Damn brat! Don't run! - Stop! - Crap. - Don't run! Cai Yun, what are you doing? - Why do you look so restless? - Nothing. Where's your purse? When you go to school, give this money to the grocery shop owner. It's for your grandma's medicine. Don't lose it. I have no more money. - I know. - Be careful. I'm going to school now. This is for you. - What the hell do you want? Go away! - Don't go! Damn kid, stay where you are! I curse your whole family! Stop! Stop right there! I said stop! Stop! Damn you, stop! Stop, you damn brat! - Shit, he's fast! - Stop! Stop right there! Stop, you damn brat! Stop, damn kid! Don't run! Damn kid! Don't run! You damn little brat. You're wasting my time! Die! You ride the bicycle so fast. It's like you're riding a motorbike. If you have the guts to gamble, then don't run. No matter how fast you are, you can't escape us. I don't understand. I curse your family. Your dad has STD. Your mom is a prostitute. Your kids are born with no butt. He really doesn't understand me. I understand you. I know you understand, but he doesn't. You have to explain it to him. But I don't understand either. Eat shit! I curse your family! You still don't understand Cantonese after so long. - I understand those two sentences. - Forget it! You explain. Listen up. - I'll give you two days' time. - Two days' time. - Otherwise… - Otherwise… - Ten dollars will become 100 dollars. - Ten dollars will become 100 dollars. I have no money. I know you have no money. Didn't you realize that when you were gambling? I haven't even hit you and you already dodged. You actually dodged? But you don't even dodge when I actually hit you. You owe me money! You don't understand Cantonese! You owe me money! You don't understand Cantonese! You owe me money! Who hit me? Come out if you dare! Throw it again! Shame on you! Three against one! Bullying the weak! Get her! - Don't run, you little brat! - Hurry! You're dead if I catch you! Crazy girl. What a busybody. FOR SHUN Be gentle. Are you okay? I'm okay. Your wife is so caring. So sweet. Hey, isn't your mistress here yet? Don't tell me the gangsters fed her to the crocodiles. Don't talk nonsense. Sorry, I forgot your wife was here. So childish. Show some respect. Here comes your mistress. Goodness. A heroine went to save her beloved just now. So brave. Who wanted to save him? You gambled, owed money, and got beaten up. You deserved it. Yes, I was beaten up, but it's none of your business. I'm warning you. Don't follow me wherever I go and please don't give me this. Give it back to me! Give it back! Give it back! Don't look at it! - Give it back to me! - The teacher is here. The teacher is here! What the hell? I asked you to collect money for me to return my debt. But the whole class only donated 40 cents. This is only enough for snacks. I need ten dollars. Ten dollars. We've tried our best. All our classmates are very poor. I have some spinning tops and marble balls. Do you want them? They're limited editions. You can burn them for your grandpa on Tomb Sweeping Day. We can't get ten dollars in a short time, unless Goddess Guanyin throws money down for you. That gives me an idea. What? A wise man has his wise plans. DONATION BOX - Steal money from the donation box? - No, we're borrowing. The rich donated this money for the needy. - You're one of the needy. - That's right. No, I have to ask first. Goddess Guanyin. I know there's money in the donation box. I need it urgently. I don't need a lot, just ten dollars. Could you please lend it to me? It's still a "no." Actually, you don't need to throw the blocks. Why not? Because Goddess Guanyin already said okay. - Did she? - Look. She already said, "Okay." You're lame. She already said okay. Why don't you take it? - She already said okay. - That's you. I don't want to steal. This is not stealing, it's borrowing! - Don't bother me! - We're trying to help you! - We're helping you! - We're trying to help you! - It's for your own good! - It's for you! Why is there a purse here? Why is there a purse here? Someone must have dropped it. Open and see if there's money inside. Ten dollars! Exactly ten dollars? I told you. Goddess Guanyin means what she says. You damn brat. Where's the purse? You'd better find it! I told you to be careful, but you still lost it. Hey, boy! This purse looks so familiar. Isn't it yours? Boy, this purse belongs to us. Can you return it to us? Sure. Where's the money? I don't know. Did you take it? No. Don't lie in front of Goddess Guanyin or you'll be punished. - No. - No. Really? - Absolutely. - Absolutely. Look at this! Where's the money? Do you know how long I've owed the money? We can't buy medicine for your grandma now. When your dad is back, you're going to get it! How can you be so careless? We can't afford her medicine now. When your dad is back, you're going to get it! You'll get it! Aren't you going to return her money? Okay. Do you know why I didn't return her the money? It's because I have an idea to make more money from this money. -What? Can you do that? - Sure. The first prize of the lucky ticket at Ah Li's shop is 20 dollars. There are only a few pieces left. If I win, I can return the money to those gangsters and I'll still have an extra ten dollars. Do you still want to gamble? - Lucky ticket isn't gambling. - It's not? Only the lottery is a form of gambling. You're lying to yourself. - It's none of your business. - Where's my money? What money? I know you took it. Give it back to me! I didn't take it. Crazy girl. You're so fierce. Ah Shun won't marry you. Give it back to me. Ah Shun, I think you should return her money. - What will I do without the money? - What about her then? I'll give it back to you. So annoying. Crap. I really have no money now. Stand! - Bow. - Bow. - Good afternoon, miss. - Good afternoon, miss. Be seated. Latecomers, stand up! I hate students who are late. Crawl out, pull your ears, and do 100 squats! The new word we're learning today is "dou." "Qing dou chu kai." You can't simply read this character. It's not "mai," but it's "dou." "Qing dou chu kai." Yes! The class is over! Cai Yun! Stop right there! How dare you run when you see me. Come here. Are you asking for a beating? Tell me. Who took your purse? Tell me! Sir. It was me. So it was you. You returned an empty purse. Where's the money? Didn't I return… Dad, don't blame him. I was the one who lost it. It's not him. He's not involved in this. So you finally admit it. You'll get it when we get home. But that money… Ah Shun, we should've given that money to the gangsters. Who knows what Cai Yun did with it? Now, her dad is chasing you for money. Exactly. I can't even walk home feeling safe. Let's walk here. It should be safer. Those gangsters always come from there. You must be aware of that side. I'll be dead if they appear from there. I know you'll feel bad if they hit me. I'm thinking for you guys. What are you doing? Hurry up. - Crap! - Hey, don't be afraid. I'm not here for you. Come here. Come on. Your debt is cleared. What are you afraid of? You're a gentleman for returning the money. It's good that there are people like you. I don't understand. Didn't you ask that little girl to return the money for you? He said a little girl paid off your debts. A little girl paid off my debts? It's that girl who has a good aim. Cai Yun? We have work to do. We need to hurry. - Otherwise, he'll escape. - Yes. Cai Yun didn't return the money to her mom. No wonder her parents kept looking for me. You can't even do a simple task! I asked you to buy medicine, but you lost the money! If you can't find the money back, I'll hit you until you become crippled! Do you hear me? We're in trouble. What now? If you don't return the money to her, I think her dad will really make her crippled. - Do you understand me? - Stupid girl! What should we do? The lucky tickets you mentioned that day. You're right. Let's try it tomorrow. Okay. There are only eight pieces left. We'll win for sure. Boss. Six pieces, please. Take two each. THANK YOU, PLEASE COME AGAIN THANK YOU, PLEASE COME AGAIN THANK YOU, PLEASE COME AGAIN Boss, two more pieces, please. - These two are not for sale. - What? Boss. Boss, we want the previous sheet. Buy these or leave. Boss, don't try to cheat us. I'm not. I'm an honest businessman. - How much money do you have left? - Ten cents. Ten cents for two pieces. I'll give you three. Fine. I'll give you four pieces. Pick this one for a guaranteed win. This is weird. Why are these lucky tickets prizes? My problem is still unsolved. What do I do? We only have one solution now. Trust me this time. What's the solution? Follow me. Are you sure we can use these as offerings to Goddess Guanyin? I know it's not suitable, but we only have these. My grandma told me that praying is all about sincerity. What you offer is secondary. Is that so? Yes. Can we just take the money after praying? Yes. Didn't I say this before? Just tell Goddess Guanyin what you want. She'll always say, "Okay." Look. Ah Shun, let's do it. How can we get the money out? Where's the lock? Is there any opening? It turns out stealing is not an easy job. We're not stealing, we're just borrowing. Ah Shun! Cai Yun is moving out. Moving out? I saw them loading things onto a lorry. Once they move, you won't get to return her money. You'll owe her for the rest of your life. Right, I found this when I was packing my bag. We need to get the money out now. Ah Shun, Cai Yun did many things for you, but you always ignored her. No matter what, you must say goodbye to her in person and return the money you owe. Or else, you'll really owe her too much. You'll owe her for the rest of your life. I'll just take ten dollars. Return the rest to Goddess Guanyin. This is my last year in this village and this school. I'm moving soon. Cai Yun, what are you doing? Hurry up! No matter where I go, I'll always wish you the best. Bye. Cai Yun. More rain is forecast for most of Singapore and Southern Malaysia. There will be light showers in Central and Eastern Singapore with heavy rain forecast in the North. And now, the end of an era. Today for the first time in 150 years, Singapore will wake up to find itself without any British military presence. It was once one of the biggest British military bases in the world. Now, the last horn has sounded and the Union Jack taken down from the post. Did it rain last night? Be careful. It's fine, ma'am. Look at the sky. It's still clear. Do you want me to help you? You don't need to, ma'am. There isn't much laundry to dry for now. There will be more to wash and dry in a few months. Sorry to interrupt the broadcast. We bring you an important news headline. The final departure of the British military forces from Singapore marks the end of an imperial presence in Southeast Asia which has lasted for 150 years. The 56 British outposts… There's a moth on my mom's photograph. It's because a new visitor is coming to our house soon. That's the reason. Sign this document. We have to leave for the office soon. Ask Leela to sign it too. Dad. Actually, both of us don't want to go. What are you talking about? I've made the decision. Just sign it. Don't waste my time. No, Dad. Leela and I have decided. You don't have a job here. In England, the British will provide. Why do you want to stay in a country where nobody will take care of us? We came with the British, we'll leave with them. Just sign it. But… I think I can find another job here, Dad. Who's putting these ideas into your head? Is it your wife? Just sign it. Both of you, now. No, Dad. I can't do this. You dare to defy me? You won't go? No one here has the right to be so disrespectful to the father of my child. Do you think we'll be happy if we migrate to England? Tell me. Why do you fear your dad so much? Am I not important to you? I'm carrying your child. Have you forgotten that? Weren't we born in this country? Then our child should be born in this country too. No matter how much we'll suffer, I don't want our child to grow up in a place where he or she will be treated as a second-class citizen. I really don't know how to get out of this. I don't know how to do any other kind of work. You'll definitely find a good job here. I don't know what the future holds for us, but I'll always be with you no matter how difficult it gets. Why do you have to be afraid? I'm not leaving. Tell your dad that we'll remain here. I am filled with grief and tears When you leave for the land of fears I'll pray every single day Pray for you when you're away In this final moment Together Let us remember this Forever A pair of tearful eyes Watches another While a grieving person - Sends another - Sends another "BUNGA SAYANG" Hello, is Mrs. Lim there? Hello, Mom. Why isn't there any water at home? Did you turn on the tap? Yes. My whole body is covered in soap. What should I do? My goodness. I think your dad forgot to pay the utilities bill. What should I do? Go look for our neighbors. Be polite. Hello, is anybody home? Is anybody home? Ma'am, there's no water in my house. Could you let me take a shower inside? What did you say? I don't understand. Inside… Here… I… No water. Can I come inside, please? In a village by the sea There stands a tall and ancient tree Which is a place of shelter And a place where lovebirds meet It shares our joy and feels our pain It grows with us through sun and rain "Bunga Sayang" is my favorite song. I've made too many kuih. I can't finish them all. Would you like some? Bunga sayang Bunga sayang You are Heaven's Own work of art Faizal, what is bunga? Bunga is flower. I see. I thought it was kuih. Don't bluff me. Bunga is flower. Ma'am. Is there no water at home again? Ma'am, bunga. Bunga. Bunga is flower. Bunga, flower. Bunga. Sayang. In a village by the sea There stands a tall and ancient tree Which is a place of shelter And a place where lovebirds meet It shares our joy and feels our pain It grows with us through sun and rain It stays so green the whole year through And flowers when a dream comes true - Bunga sayang - Bunga sayang - Bunga sayang - Bunga sayang You are Heaven's Own work of art - Bunga sayang - Bunga sayang - Bunga sayang - Bunga sayang Gentle flower Of the heart How about this? Too formal. You mean, make it more casual? Something like this? Is it better? And I wouldn't wear the jewelry. I know what you mean. The last thing I want to do is to outdress her. But I also don't want her to think that we can't afford a family either. Li Ning. Are you really sure you want to meet her? What if she sees you and wants Michelle back? She can't do that. We've already got the adoption order. We've waited so many years for this. Why complicate matters now? Kang. When your daughter grows up, she will want to know about her birth mother. I want to be able to tell her. When I see her tomorrow, I will thank her. Okay? I will tell her that her daughter is very much loved. Yes. Maybe she had a nightmare. I'll get her milk. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Just the two of you? Sumathi Rajendran. Soh Li Ning. Are there many parents like me who want to meet the birth mother? You're the second client in all my 15 years who has made this request. Second? I thought more would ask. Most people don't want trouble. Why do you want to know? I'm only doing this because you keep calling me. So how did that meeting go? Mrs. Wong, a banker. She also wanted to meet the birth mother of her son, but only wanted to observe her from a distance. So I said, "Okay." And we drove up to Malaysia like we're doing now. And we observed the mother from a distance. After she saw the mother, she asked me, "Why does she dress so badly and only wearing slippers?" I said, "Mrs. Wong." Do you think if the mother was as comfortable as you, she'd give her baby up for adoption? Have you met Michelle's birth mom? What is she like? She's in her early twenties, it's her first child. I remember she signed the adoption papers without any hesitation. I asked her, "Are you sure?" She said, "Yes." She just signed and walked off. Hello? Yes. We just crossed the checkpoint. We'll be there in five minutes. Wait for us. I have something to tell you. My Malaysian partner cannot find the mother. What do you mean? She's not here today. Then why have you taken me all the way here? My partner will explain everything to you. Come. Hi, sorry to keep you waiting. Don't worry, we started first. This is Kim Leng, my Malaysian partner. Her signature is on all your adoption papers. Ah Gek, how are you? I'm good. This is Ah Gek. She introduced us to the birth mother. I said you'd explain everything to her. Come, let's order some food first. What do you want to eat? Nasi lemak and tea. I'm sorry you had to come all the way here. Sumathi wanted us to speak with you. We really tried to reach the birth mother, but we just couldn't find her. We even went to Pekan Nanas a few times to look for her, but there was no one in the house. Pekan Nanas? Where is Pekan Nanas? It's about an hour from here. So you called her? We did many times, but there was no answer. Was her phone disconnected? I don't know. Auntie. Was her phone disconnected? I don't know. I went to her house many times, but no one seemed to be at home. After she gave birth, she said she wanted to go to Penang to take a break. So she moved back to Penang? Have you asked her neighbors, colleagues, or family? We tried. Auntie, how did you meet her? I met her in a coffee shop one day in Pekan Nanas. She was sitting by herself, looking very sad. I asked her what the problem was. She said she had troubles and didn't know what to do. So I introduced her to Kim Leng. Once she agreed to the adoption, we took her in and looked after her. She stayed with you? No, she stayed at her own house. But we visited her very often to make sure she was well taken care of, that she took her vitamins, and that she kept her doctor's appointments. Did she mention the father? Did he come to see her? We don't ask too many questions. If they want to tell us, they tell us. Did her family come to visit her? What language did she speak? She speaks Chinese, but she can speak a bit of English. She worked as a clerk in a factory. Was she an account clerk? A clerk. But she stopped working soon after we took her in. Was that where she met the father, in the factory? Yes, I think he worked in the same place. But he was not involved in the birth? So leading up to the birth, there were no visitors, no colleagues, or relatives. Auntie, did she have any visitors when she was expecting? No. But I visited her often. I brought her snacks. She liked oyster omelet best. Oyster omelet? What did she look like? She's plump and quite tall. Is she about your height? She's a bit taller than me. I brought a photo of our family to show her today. This is Michelle, my husband, and her grandparents. She's growing very well. She's a pretty girl with big eyes, so cute. - She has very curly hair. - Yes. Can she walk yet? Not yet, she only crawls. But she crawls quickly. One last question. On my daughter's original birth certificate, she had called her "Amy," a Christian name. Do you know why she called her that? I don't know. Come, let's eat. Mom, are we there yet? Soon, another 30 minutes. Michelle, do you know where we are? This town is Pekan Nanas. Pekan Nanas? It means Pineapple Town. Pineapple? That's so funny. They used to grow pineapples here. Do you remember I told you that you were born in Malaysia? This town is where your birth mom gave birth to you. Put it on nicely. So pretty. One, two, three. Pineapple! My dear friend, Ismail, how have you been? First, I would like to apologize for not writing to you in the past year. Many things have changed in Singapore. Be careful. Excuse me, is this train going to Tanjong Pagar? Tanjong Pagar? There's no more Tanjong Pagar. Everyone gets off at Woodlands now. Where are you staying in Singapore? I'm not staying. Do you have a return ticket? Sir, do you have a return ticket back to Malaysia? We called the clinic in Kelantan. His dementia is in the early stage. He's fit for travel. What about his daughter? They'll try and contact her. Okay. This is your return ticket. Make sure you remember where you keep it. Okay. Uncle. Next time, ask your daughter to come with you. Don't travel on your own. The number you've just called is not in use. Thank you. The number you've just called is not in use. Thank you. I'd like to go to Tanglin Halt. Tanglin Halt? Sure. How much? 20 to 25 dollars. It depends on the traffic. My little brother still asks about you. I brought him to the Capitol last week to watch a rerun of The Sound of Music. Did you know that the Von Trapp Family ran away not by hiking through the mountains like in the movie? They took a train instead. These movies always make things so dramatic. We miss going to the movies with you. Excuse me, do you know this address? Sorry, I don't know. Do you know where Block 74 is? Block 74. Do you know where Block 74 is? I don't know, sir. Block 74? It was gone a long time ago. Who are you looking for? My old friend. Can I see it? Is this you? Yes. It's so long ago. What's that? Her phone number. I tried calling, but it didn't get through. Did you dial "6" first? Okay, let me try. There, it's ringing. Welcome to Chung Cheng High School. To select English, press one. Where is Chung Cheng High School? You asked why I wouldn't leave with you. I didn't have an answer. When I stood on that platform and watched you depart, I really wished I could jump on board the train with you. But I didn't follow my heart. Maybe I was too much of a coward. Or maybe I'm really just happy here. Does that answer your question? So you mean you haven't come back to Singapore since then? No. Ma'am, could you please come over? I have something to ask you. This man here is looking for a teacher who used to teach here. Do you recognize her? This is Mrs. Heng. Mrs. Heng? She's a very nice person. When my son was studying in Australia, they helped to watch over him. Her husband's also very nice. So did they move to Australia? Yes. She said they migrated to Australia. Are you still in contact with them? No. It has been so long. Something else has changed, Ismail. Wee Beng proposed to me. And I said yes. I'm not sure how you'll take this, but I would really like you to come to our wedding. That is, if you're willing to come back. I don't care what my dad might think. I'll reserve a seat for you. I'm sure my brother will be thrilled to see you. I enclose the photo that we took on the day you left. It's for keepsake. Are you really not coming? And cut. Okay, try saying this. "Awak kacak." "Awak kacak." What does it mean? It means, "You are handsome." My god. Let's take a picture. Okay. Okay. One, two, three. Nice. Hashtag, "Awak kacak." Recalculating. In 100 meters, turn left. Please follow the highlighted route. Turn left. Turn left again? Didn't we just turn left here a while ago? We should've waited until next week. There's not a single car today. We can't even follow anyone. You know it's going to be really crowded next week. We come here every year and we still get lost. Should we turn left? - Go straight. - How should I know? Every road looks identical. - Check the map on your phone. - Are you crazy? It's expensive to use the Internet out here. What should we do then? - Do we turn or not? - Go straight. Grandma says go straight ahead. Are you sure, Mother? The GPS tells us to turn left. Go straight ahead. Okay. We'll go straight ahead. I think we're on the right track. Your grandma is even more accurate than the GPS. I'll ask them to help. Ah Soon. Come and help me with this. Don't drop it. - Be careful. - I can't. We just reached. - Stay here. - You guys go ahead. Ah Leng, call your friends when we return to Singapore. - Long-distance calls are expensive. - Okay, my mom is freaking out. - I'll text you when I reach immigration. - Mom, here. Bye. Mother, this is heavy. Leave it to the kids. - No problem, I can handle it. - No, Mom. - Ah Leng, take this. - Okay. - Grandma, let me carry it. - You can hold the umbrella. - Let's go, Ah Soon. - Hold on to your grandma. Be careful. Help me with this. It's very heavy. I have a viewing later at two. If Mom goes into her long speeches again, you've got to help me. Why are you always making me play the villain? You're the one who wanted to come here today. Can't you change your appointment? The client is only available today. He wanted to check if the unit is affected by the afternoon sun. Did you bring what I asked you to? Here you go. This doesn't make any sense at all. Those were 67, 68. Then the number jumps to 75. Grandma, Grandpa's number is 95, right? - Yes. - Is this the right way? Just head towards that tree in front. Okay. Grandma, can you walk slower? I don't want to go home too early. Don't you have swimming lessons in the afternoon? My gosh. I always come in last. The coach says I'm fat. Grandma, can we walk slower? Okay, I'll walk slower. IN LOVING MEMORY Dad is done with the food. Ah Ban, since you've eaten your fill, it's time to listen to me. You must bless your son and your grandchildren. Your son, Ah Huat, has been unlucky these days. His business has gone downhill recently because of the government's "pitiful noodles." - It's "cooling measure." - Fewer people are buying properties. It has been really tough for him. You must help him. Since you're up there, can you look for Goh Keng Swee? He was a big shot. He might be able to tell the government to loosen the regulations. Please bless your son. You must also bless your daughter-in-law. She prepared all the dishes that you ate today. She looks after the entire family all by herself. It's really tough on her too. Ah Huat is lucky to have her as his wife. You must keep her safe and healthy. Your two grandchildren are here today to pay their respects to you. Come and pay your respects to your grandpa. Ah Leng is 18 this year. She'll be going to a college in America in a few months. Make sure that she finds a boyfriend there. It doesn't matter if he's White, Chinese, or Black, as long as he's a good man. Ah Soon is seven. He's in first grade. He'll take his first exams at the end of the year. You must make sure that the exam questions are easy enough, so he can be the top student in his class. Don't forget to bless us. Grandma, can we burn the offerings now? Yes, you can. We can start? - Okay. - You can burn these. - Okay. - Watch your brother. - Don't let him burn himself. - Mom, don't do it. - You'll hurt your hip. - All right. - Do you have any matches? - No. But I have this. - Where did you get this? - Your drawer. Don't worry. I won't tell Dad and Mom. Mom, it's really hot here. Leave it to the kids. I'll take you back to the car to rest. There's air conditioning in the car. No. After we're done with the burning, I have more things to tell your dad. You tell Dad the same things every year. He must be bored to death. Mother, look at this. This phone is the latest. It has a built-in GPS. With this phone, Father will never get lost. Hello, Mr. Tan? This is Simon Ong. Sorry, I'm still stuck in Johor Bahru. There has been an unexpected delay. I'm so sorry. Why don't we fix another... This is bad. Ah Soon has swimming lessons at 3 p.m. Dad, do you think we can reach home by 4 p.m.? I'm meeting my friends. One of them has swimming lessons, the other is meeting friends. Don't ask me. Ask your grandma! Once you've passed the immigration, head towards Woodlands Road and you'll reach the old Malay village. The village is gone now. It was torn down by the government in 1989 to make way for a newer and bigger Woodlands checkpoint. Continue straight to the police station at the tenth milestone. It's no longer there though. It has been replaced by a huge shopping mall. Do you remember your cobbler friend, Zhim, who stays next to the Taoist goddess temple at Bukit Panjang Village? The entire village is gone now. It has been replaced by public housing. After the tenth milestone, the battery factory that used to be there is also gone. The railway tracks on the right are still there, but there are no more trains. The railway station moved from Tanjong Pagar to Woodlands three years ago. Go straight until the Beauty World Amusement Park. The whole area is a car park now. When you reach the seventh milestone, you'll see Bukit Timah Market and Food Center. Your favorite carrot cake and satay noodles are still there. As you continue straight, you'll see that Bukit Timah Road has changed a lot. The Yeo Hiap Seng Sauce Factory is gone. The Singapore Turf Club moved to Kranji in 1999. The villages there are gone now. They're replaced by luxury housing. Continue to Adam Road Food Center at the fourth milestone. It was renovated six years ago. It's very nice and clean now. Do you remember how you used to love the ginger tea there even though you got diarrhea every time you drank it? You were such a stubborn mule. Turn left at the food center and walk towards Coffee Hill. They're exhuming the graves there to make way for a new road. Continue walking straight towards Bishan. After Mount Alvernia Hospital, at the fourth milestone, you'll see a bus stop on your right. Turn right and go up the slope. The first block in front of you, on the 18th floor, with the green door, is our home. It's number 95, right? Yes, it is. This is so odd. The numbers on the gravestones are all messed up. Seriously. I know. Head towards that tree. Are you sure? Yes. That's right. The unit is 1,500 square feet. It doesn't get the afternoon sun. The seller is in a hurry because he's immigrating. That's why the price is so attractive. IN LOVING MEMORY This afternoon? At 1 p.m.? Okay, no problem. I'll see you later. We can go now. Let's go. But the fire is still burning. Let it burn on its own. Okay. Ah Soon, let's go. You have swimming lessons at 3 p.m. Hurry up, let's go. Ah Soon, we're leaving. Recalculating. Turn right. Turn right. Turn right again? Didn't we just turn right here? Pass me the map. This is bad. They're delivering the new TV at 12 p.m. If we're not home, we'll have to reschedule. Is this the road? You're blocking me. Where on earth is the main road? - Ah Soon! - Ah Soon! - What are you doing? - Ah Soon! - Ah Soon! - Ah Soon, stop running! Ah Soon, stop running! Hey! - Ah Soon! - Ah Soon! Previously, there was no entry fee. But now, you need to pay 2,70 dollars to enter Singapore. I think it's best if you and Grandpa walk across the immigration and grab a cab. This way, you won't have to pay. Grandma, we moved to Redhill last week. It's easier to get to our new house from here now. Once you've passed the immigration, take the old Woodlands Road. I remember you telling Grandpa that the Malay village there is gone now. It was torn down to make way for a bigger Woodlands checkpoint. Grandma. From Woodlands, continue straight to the tenth milestone. The police station there has been replaced by a shopping complex. Do you remember Grandpa's cobbler friend, Zhim, who stayed next to the Taoist goddess temple at Bukit Panjang Village? The entire village there is gone now. It has been replaced by public housing. After the tenth milestone, the battery factory at the ninth milestone has also been torn down. The railway tracks on the right are still there. However, there are no more trains. I remember you telling Father that the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station moved to Woodlands four years ago. Go straight until the Beauty World Amusement Park. The whole area is a car park now. When you reach the seventh milestone, you'll see Bukit Timah Food Center. Dad. Your favorite carrot cake and satay noodles are still there. Mom. I remember when I was still a boy, every Sunday morning, you and Dad would always take me there for breakfast. Do you still remember?
