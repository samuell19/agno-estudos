- [Man] Come on out! - Is it time for execution? - Hurry! Go on. Hurry. - Hmm. Silvaki. - Sir! - Metuni. - Sir! - You want to be spared? - The two of you have spent a lot of time in China. You speak Chinese, and you know the country. At least you ought to. Now, then. We'll give you a job. You do it, and you live. Well don't you have tongues? - [Prisoners] Sir! - There's an order just come in from imperial headquarters. You will be given a certain time to fulfill that order, and if you should fail, well then, you'll die. - [Prisoners] Sir! (train whistle blowing) (dramatic music) (man shouts) (men grunting) - Damn you. Don't you know that I'm the foreman around here?! - Didn't mean it. - Dammit, I'll teach you! (men grunting) - Hold it! Wong-Seng, what is all this? Why are you beating him up? - Listen, that's my affair. (men grunting) (dramatic music) (men grunting) - [Man] Wong-Seng. - Hey boss. He's dead. - Serves him right. He asked for it. And still, who started this? - Cheng-Wu. - String him up. (dramatic music) - Hey look, look. - Let's get Wong-Seng. - It's all his fault! - Right, let's get it! (men grunting) - Hey, hey, hey hey. Now just wait. - You scared? Are you? - I'm not scared. But after all, this place is controlled by the Japs. Well, I don't give a damn about that. We're Chinese, and the Wong-Seng isn't a Jap, so he shouldn't treat us like this. - Right. Let's go. - Come on. - Come on. - This way. - Hey, who do you want? - Wong-Seng, listen. You were the one who started that fight. Why did you lie? - I wanted to. So what? - You ought to be hanged. - What's that? - You heard. Damn you. (metal bonking) (men grunting) (metal clanging) - Wong-Seng, let's discuss this. Just calm down. (tense music) - Tell me, who the hell cut him down? Was it you? Did you cut him down? - I did. - I did. - You... Who? I gave orders to leave him right there. Damn it. Who the hell do you think you are? - Manager. This man's badly hurt, though. - Hmm. I'll take the responsibility. - But still. - Still what? You just look after your clinic here. As for the men, I'm the one who decides what's best. - Manager. What about these two here? What do we do with them? - Got it? - Good. (men laughing) (tense music) - Listen. We're all Chinese. How can he treat us like this? - It's Wong-Seng. He's a troublemaker here. Dil-so, the manager. He always backs him up. (tense music) - Mr. Feet, Mr. Feet. Mr. Feet. - So-Hu. Why are you here? - My sister told me to bring you water. - Oh. Did she say anything? - Oh, she did. She said she'd try and help you, and that I should be careful. (tense music) - So-Hu, please give me some of that. - [So-Hu] Right. - So-Hu. - Just wait! - You started that fight today. I know that you did. And you want to know just why I haven't punished you for that. Huh? And instead of you, Ching-Fu got punished, didn't he? - Hmm. You and Pei are nice guys. And you want the job finished. That's the main thing, - Right. (man chuckling) And work harder now. - Mm. - And I'll give you more time off, huh? Huh? To see your girl? - Manager? - Huh? - What is it? - Manager. - Huh? Damn girl. (boy laughing) (dramatic music) All right. Why'd you take him water? - I didn't! - Tell me who sent you. - It was me. Miss Yu, I know that you're the master's young niece. Still. You have to obey the rules here. Understand that? - No, I don't, rule? - Now come on. You know what I mean. - I don't want to know. - So-Hu, come on. - Hmm? - What do you want? - Before you go, I'll make myself quite clear. Now, I'm the manager of this timber yard here, and I make the rules. All right? Got that? That clear? - Don't scare me. - What's making you so mad? - Uncle, I tell you, this is getting me down. I just can't stand it anymore. - What are you talking about now? - I tell you, it's these poor workers. The way that they're treated, it's terrible. - Oh? What's terrible? - Well, they're not slaves or prisoners, but they get treated as though they were. I don't like him. - Ah, now Feng, you don't understand. The workers are very stubborn men. You try being kind to them. It won't get you far. - (indistinct), but why torture? - Oh? Has something happened, then? - You come see for yourself. (tense music) Uncle, see what I mean? (solemn music) - Who did this? - Uncle, as the manager and foreman. Who else could order this? - Untie them! - You- - You. - What's this? I'm the owner of this place. Untie them! - Yes, yes. - Yes. (solemn music) - Thank you. For helping us. - It's all right. - Mr. Cheng. The deadline, it's changed. - What? - They dropped the date forward by 10 full days. - How can they? - Huh, well they have and that's that. So that means night shifts. - I can't make the men work night shifts. There's no provision for that in the contract. - Huh, yeah. Well, we have to meet that deadline. So then, double shifts. (tense music) - Move! Move! - More overtime. - They can't do that to us. - Hey, I hear we're going on double shifts, night and day, day and night. Even a machine needs some rest. - Sure. - Hey! Come on. Dammit! Come on. You talking again? - Listen, don't push us too hard. It's unreasonable. - Dammit. I'm in charge. Go on, come on. - Hey. You hit (indistinct). - I sure will. What did you say? Dammit. Want trouble? - I said nothing. (man grunting) (men grunting) - Damn him. Come on, let's get him! (men grunting) - Come on, I'll fix you. - Oh yeah? We'll see about that. (men grunting) - Wong-Seng? - God damn you more. (men grunting) (man mumbles indistinctly) - Hmm? - Wong-Seng's fighting again. You've got trouble. - God damn, not again. The workmen need a diversion. Give 'em a night off. Tell the manager I said so. - Hey, stop fighting! Stop fighting! - Listen now, don't have to work tonight. You can all have a night on the town! (men cheering) (men laughing) (men cheering) (mysterious music) - My father died years ago. So Uncle took me and Sister in. Treated us like his children. - You're lucky, to have an uncle like that. I have no one. - Really? - My family was from Canton too. We had a good life there. But then the Japs came. Those swine. - Your parents? - Both of them were murdered by the Japs. So now I'm all alone. - You mustn't give up, though. One day the Japanese will leave here. Then you'll have a bright future. - You're very reassuring. - You respect others, and respect yourself. The others have all gone into town for a good time. But you didn't. - Why should I? I much prefer to stay here with you - Really? - Although you are a woman, you're determined, and brave too. - Don't think so. (people laughing) - I want you, eh? (people chattering) (people laughing) (men laughing) - Hey. - Hey. (people chattering) - Mr. Wong. Oh. You've had far too much to drink. (man laughing) Hey, I've got a nice new girl here. - Oh? - Would you like her? - No thanks. I'll stick to my old girl. Hey, she here? - Oh dear, I'm sorry. She's out for a while. - She's out? - Yeah. - You're lying. She's in here somewhere. - Hey, hey hey hey. - Sorry, sorry. (man grunts) - Dammit! - Sorry. Sorry. - You. - Oh? - Where's Sang Hung gone. Talk! - Now look here. I told you she's gone out. - Where'd she go to? Come on. - I don't know where she is. - Hey, what is all this, huh? - You talking to me? - That's right I am! (people gasping) - Now look. Why do you always pick fights, huh? (man grunts) (people gasping) (men grunting) - Wong-Seng! Wong-Seng, you're a fool. (woman grunting) - Hey. Sei Wong, Sei Wong. (tense music) - Sir! - Please, please, go ahead, come in. (people chattering) - Huh? Hey. (men laughing) (men talking indistinctly) will you come with me, then? - With you. (men laughing) - Hey, Wong Seng. Don't get too worked up, now. She's come to see the foreman this time. (men laughing) (men shouting) - Back up, come on! Come on, you. Come on. - Idiot! I set the speed up for work. And instead you give all the men a night off? Why the hell'd you do that? - Listen. Don't worry. We'll meet the deadline. I'll get the work done. I promise. - As from now, no worker is to leave the campsite, and anybody who disobeys that order will be executed! - And you be careful. - Sir. - Get this. There's orders from headquarters. - Sir. - By the third of the month, the job here has got to be completed. And then on the very same evening, move all the workmen to another forest area. - And when you've finished your job there, returned to the military and let me know. All right? As for the workmen, you kill the damn lot! Got that? Huh? (tense music) - And if you should fail me, you're finished! You'll be shot! - Yes! Yes sir! - That's odd, where's Wong Seng, then? - Hey, listen. Sheng Hung's here. - Huh? Where is she? - There. Hey, she's getting on fine with Yung Si. Huh? - Huh? (tense music) Damn you! - Hey, stop that! (men grunting) (solemn music) (logs clattering) (men grunting) - Just listen, will you? - Shut up and fight. (men grunting) (suspenseful music) All right. That's it. (men grunting) (man shouting) (tense music) (suspenseful music) - Come out! Come out! Come out! Fight like a man! Huh? (tense music) (men grunting) - Wong Seng. Now listen. We're both workers, and Chinese. Why the hell should we fight? (Wong Seng grunts) (solemn music) - Hey, listen. What about me? Huh? Now come on, I'm hurt too. - [Woman] All right, I'll fix you up now, an injection. - Huh? Injection? - I'm afraid so. - No, I don't want it! - Come on, and please take your pants off. - Huh? (man shouting) (men laughing) - You know what? Wong's a big guy. But with that needle, one look and he was terrified! (men laughing) It is funny. Hey, you know, it's the first time we ever saw you fight, and I must admit, you fought damn well. (chuckles) - Hey, he's right. And Wong Seng isn't used to being beaten. Perhaps he won't be so damn cocky anymore! (men laughing) - Hey. Or if he is, we'll soon remind him. (men laughing) - Hey, hey, listen. You're a real tiger. And we're really hoping you're going to stay that way and not change back into a sick pussy. (men laughing) (suspenseful music) (tense music) - Listen, I want to be your friend. Think I know you better now. Come on, come and have a drink. - That's odd. Wong acting friendly. Wonder what he's up to, then, eh? - Sure. - Cheers. - You know what? You're too hot tempered. You got mad with Sang Hung when she came here today, you wouldn't listen to her, just went crazy, then went for me. - Ah. Sorry. Sorry. - Ah. That's all right. I don't mind. But you ought to apologize to her, right? - Yeah, you're right. I was out of my mind. - Mister Si, Mister Si. - Huh? So-Hu. What is it? - It's time for your medicine now. - Right. I'll come now. - Hey, you see So Feng, I'll see Sang Ho. (men laughing) Right, drink up, huh? (solemn music) - Being foreman? I'm not interested. - But still, I was thinking. You ought to be. - Then what? - None of the workers are united here, so they have no strength. That's obvious. So if they had a leader, well then, they could make themselves felt. That way, they'd have a voice. The bastards would have to listen. - Hmm. Yes they would. But still, your uncle was the owner, and he can't help us. So even if I became the foreman, I could do nothing. The manager. Do you think he's funding for somebody? - I couldn't say. But still. Two strangers came here today, were speaking Japanese. They were saying when this job's finished, then they'd take the workers somewhere else. - You sure of that? - Hmm. You know, I thought Wong Seng would help the workers, but still all he does is start fights. Nothing else. - Well, and me? - Cheers. That young kid suddenly pops up on the scene and beats the hell out of Wong Seng. And now the workers are looking up to him. - Perhaps we ought to rethink this one. Maybe this kid could be useful to us here. - Hmm. Maybe he could, But this guy won't be as easy to control as Wong. Still. We'll try it. - It's all very odd. How come he's such a good fighter? And where'd he come from? - Ah, why should we care? If we can control both the new guy and Wong, then we should have no problem with the workers. And when this job's finished, we'll be free again. And if we do this other job too, they tell me we'll get a bonus! (men laughing) - Hey, it just shows. You never can tell when your luck's gonna change, can you? (men laughing) - Right, that's settled. We'll push the workers harder and get more guards. And in the meantime, I'll make the new fellow a foreman. (men grunting) - Move it! Move it! Come on! Move it! Hurry. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hurry. Come on. (men grunting) Hurry. Hurry. Come on. (men grunting) come on, come on. Hurry up. - What the hell do they think they're doing? If we go on like this, we'll soon be dead, won't we? - Huh? Hmm. - Sir. That's right. The work down here is almost finished now. Don't worry. I'm not scared of these Chinese. - Hmm. - Got it. - Sure. Thank you, huh? (chuckling) Know what? That was a real smart move. To get those two guys in charge. They can get all the men working. Then we won't have to worry about finishing on time. - Long as we control those two guys, well then, the rest will be no worry. - Manager! Manager. Manager. - Gone? How could they have gone? Hey, you. Go get 'em! (tense music) - I'm finished. Can't go on. - You have to. Come on. - I can't. I'm finished. You go on. Just leave me. Go on! - Come on. You can make it, we're nearly there. Come on, we just got to get up to that hill. - Go, you go on. Go. - Listen, we can't hang around, or else they'll catch us. Come on now. (solemn music) (dramatic music) - Hold it. I said hold it! (dramatic music) - Listen, listen. I'll come back. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please give me another chance! (man grunting) - Damn you! You'd run. - No I won't. No I won't. I won't! I won't! (man grunts) (tense music) (man growls) (men grunting) - Hey, your turn. (man grunting) That'll teach him. (man grunting) - Quick, come on. - Hey. Where's Wong Seng? Have you seen him anywhere? - He's not here. He's not back yet. - What now? - Listen. If we don't stop them soon, they'll beat him to death. - Even Wong couldn't help us. - We can't just stand here now. (man grunting) - Hold it! - Get him! (men grunting) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (men shouting) (men grunting) (suspenseful music) (men grunting) - Ko Sing. Ko Sing, Ko Sing. - Quick, they're killing the men. - Huh? - Huh? - Wong, quick. - Right. (suspenseful music) - My god. Who did it? - It was that manager, of course. - God damn it. He'll pay for it. - Listen! - Let go. - Wong Seng! Come back! (suspenseful music) - What do you want? - Who killed those four men? Was it you, huh? - And so? Huh? We'll kill anyone who leaves. (men grunting) Listen. Let him go. - Right. But just for you. I should really finish him. Take him. - Smoke? Listen. I could make you a foreman. You like that? - No thanks. - And why not, though? - I'll tell you why. I'm not good enough. No skill. - But still, the supervisor and me could help you to learn the job. - I'll let you know. - Hey wait, come back. - It's you. (tense music) Tell me, have you accepted the job? - I couldn't work for him. I just couldn't. (solemn music) - But still, it would help the workers. And I think that you ought to take it. - Hmm. They just want to use me, just like they do Wong. The fat guy and the manager. They're bastards, both of 'em. Let them do the job. I don't want it. - Right. We've had enough. We'll take no more. - Yeah, that's right. - That's right. - You're right. - He's right. - They beat us up. Work us to death. Well, I've had enough. I'm leaving here now! - Right! (people chattering) - Let's see what Wong thinks. Wong, what do you think? - But still, try and leave? There'll be big trouble! (people chattering) - You used to be so tough. So how come you're so chicken now? - Now look, we relied on you. We can't make it without you! (workers shouting) - You're just not fit to be our foreman! (men shouting) - All right! If that's what you want. I'll tell the men. We're quitting! (workers cheering) (tense music) - So that's it, huh? They're all planning to quit their jobs. - Yeah, that's right. And Wong seems to be the leader, too. He's been going around talking to the men. I mean, I saw him. - Hmm. Wong Seng? You'll be sorry. I'll have your hide! (whip cracks) All right. Let's get him! - Hey boss, hey boss. - What is it? - Listen, that new guy isn't going with them. He said they'd only be trouble. - He's a smart guy. - Yeah. He's tells Wong to be patient, but still, Wong wouldn't listen, though. And now he's gone, spreading the word. - Where is he now? - He's just left. - Do you know where he's going to? - I'm not too sure. I think he said he'd go to the clinic. - Let's kill him! (suspenseful music) - Sister? Sister! - Ho, what's wrong? - Really? How do you know they want to kill Wong? - I was in the tree, and I heard them talking. - Did they see you? - Of course not. - We must warn him. You go down to Wong, find him. - All right. (tense music) (man whistling) Mister Wong, Mister Wong! Mister Wong! Mister Wong! (suspenseful music) (men grunting) - What's this? - Wong Seng, you double-crosser. (men grunting) (dramatic music) (men grunting) (suspenseful music) (man shouting) - So-Hu, you go and ask Mr. Si to come here. (men grunting) (dramatic music) (men grunting) - What do you want? Looking for Wong Seng? - That's Wong Seng there. - And you better get back to work, or you'll get the same. Hear that? - Go on. - Right. - Uncle, you must do something about this. - There's nothing at all I can do. - Uncle, sure you can. I mean, you own this place. Just tell those two to stop all this. - Now then. You don't understand. - I know one thing, Those two men have got some sort of hold over you. - Huh? What gives you that idea? - Because you seem afraid of them. - I'm not afraid. But think, though. The Japanese control this area, and they're very interested in everything that goes on here. - Those two men are Japanese? Huh? May as well tell you. You're quite right there. They are both sent by the Japanese army. (solemn music) One is Sergeant Mituni, and the other Captain Silvaki. - So that's it. But why are they here? - The Japanese army needs timber for their war supplies. It's one of the things that Japan is very short of. So then, those men have been sent to supervise. - In that case, you are nothing but a puppet, working for the Japanese, betraying our country. You're simply a traitor! - I couldn't help it. - Uncle, that's all we live for, to get rid of them. That one day we can live in peace again, and that time is not too far off, but you're helping to strengthen their position. - I know what you want, but I just can't. I can't. I just can't. (solemn music) - Japanese, Japanese. (grunts) Dammit. Of course I should've guessed they were Japanese. - Wong Seng is dead. So perhaps you can be our leader now, - Listen. What do you say? Do we keep collaborating? - No. But I won't put you in danger. I've got a plan. - Uncle! Quickly! The new man's going to destroy the bridge! Quickly! (men whispering) Come quick! Quickly! Uncle! Uncle. - What's wrong? - It's awful, awful. They're going to destroy the bridge. I know, I saw them. - Listen, it's the new guy. - Only he would have thought of that. - The bastard. The nerve of him. Damn him. And after I promoted him as well. - Your fault. I told you you couldn't trust him. - Uncle, what are we going to do? - Hey, come on. - Right. (dramatic music) - The bridge, it's gone. - No, wait. - What will we do? - I don't like the look of this. I think it's all part of a trick. They're trying to trap us! - This is going to mess up the schedule. - We'll see. But he's gonna pay. Listen. You tie up the girl and the kid. - Huh? Come on. You can't do that now. - Shut up, old fool! I need those two as bait for a little tap! (suspenseful music) - It's no use! Hurry! Tell the men, get out! - Hey, quick, follow me, come on. Come on, quick. This way. (suspenseful music) - All right. What's this? - No use. Japs too smart. Plan didn't work. I think Si's in real danger. - Well, if the Japs get hold of him, the rest of us are finished! - Right. - Right, what do we do? - Only one thing to do. Attack 'em! (workers chattering) (tense music) (men grunting) (men grunting) (men shouting) (men grunting) (eerie music) - Sister, I'm thirsty. I want a drink. - So-Hu. Quiet. It's all right. Patient. Be patient. - Sister? Uncle Si, will he come and help us? - But he can't come here. All those men'll catch him. - Sister, I'm so hot. Why doesn't Uncle Si come and help? (woman gasping) - Go away! It's a trap! (suspenseful music) (men grunting) (dramatic music) - All right, you. We've got you now. - Have you? You lousy Jap. You're gonna pay for everything you've done to date. - You've got no chance at me. (man shouts) (men grunting) (suspenseful music) (man groaning) (men grunting) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (men grunting) (man shouting) (men grunting) (suspenseful music) (men grunting) (man shouting) (dramatic music) (man groaning) (people chattering) - Quickly. (woman gasping) (people chattering) - All right you all right? - Uncle. - [Woman] Wake up. (solemn music) (sign clatters) (fire crackling) (man shouts) - Now burn it! Now burn it! Now burn it all! Burn it all! Burn! Burn! Burn! The Japs won't get it! Burn it! (solemn music) - The yard's on fire! Your uncle did it! - He did it? (dramatic music)
