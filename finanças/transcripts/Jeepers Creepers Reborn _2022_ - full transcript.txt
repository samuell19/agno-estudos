Texas. Now I'm in the lead. Oh, that's mine. - Uh, uh! - Yeah. Coming out of Greenburg it pa- - No We passed it and it's passing us now. No, that was not Texas. That was Georgia and it was a blue van and I remember it distinctly. No, no, no, no, no. Mhm. - You are stealing my plate. - No. Not even a local station. Well, the best bargains are in the most far flung places. Far flung places. Oh, I hate that commercial. Ah, such a pretty day. Yes, ma'am, it is. BEAT-NG-U'? Beating? I'm the one that's in the lead. Or is it B-EAT-NG-U? Ha-ha, either way, it's a vanity plate, so I get doubles. Mmm! Jeez, hey now... Ronnie, he's so close! Go around. Go around! My gosh! Hey! You okay? Phew, yeah. Oh dear. Is that the same truck? Hmm... I don't think we were supposed to see that. What in the name...? Oh! He must have seen us. He couldn't have. Oh no... Hang on, honey. What's he doing?! Ah! Ronnie! What's he... ah! Oh, Ronnie, be careful! Oh! Oh! Oh! Are you okay? You all right? What just happened? He's long gone now. Just... just a road hog. Oh... - You all right? - Oh, God. Oh... Uh... Ah... What are you doing? Honey, I'm gonna call this in to the police. - What? - Well, yeah. We can't pretend that what just happened to us didn't happen to us. They gotta know about this. Oh, I don't like it, Ronnie. I don't like it one bit. Was it "I'M BEATING U?" I don't know. Okay, all right, all right, all right. We're gonna go to a gas station where they have a phone. Okay? Okay? We're gonna call this in. Oh... All right? It's going to be okay. Okay, it'll be okay. I wanna go home. I know you do, honey. Okay. Ronnie? We should stop and see what was going on with that sheet. And then we can tell the cops all about it. We gotta do it, Marie. Turning a blind eye is not an option. Love you, baby. Ronald... Come on. Okay, all right, it's all right. The sheet... Yeah. The horrifying sight that police believe Ron and Marie witnessed that day was the infamous bodies in the pit. Ron and Marie themselves have never been seen since. Just another macabre mystery from the deep south. Surely you've watched that video so many times you have it memorized by now? No, real talk. This really happened. Somewhere in this area, actually. Come on, there's a reason those things are unsolved. It's all myths and legends. Move over. Nah, this YouTube video's out of date. This was from, what, twenty plus years ago. Now this was... Ch-ch-ch... Oh it's just like Bigfoot, Mothman, Spring hill Jack, Chupacabra or any others. Yeah, and you'll be meeting fans of all of them by tonight. I can't believe I let you drag me to this nerd fest. Yeah? Explain me this. Now, this is real footage. Even you can't deny it. You can't even see it. Ever wonder why those proof videos are always shaky and murky, never crisp and clear? It's old. The Creeper only comes back every 23 years. And the earth is flat. Nazis are camped out on the moon. Elvis lives. The Apollo landing was faked... Your precious science doesn't have all the answers! Conspiracy theories have no answers. Y'all get it wrong all the time. Copernicus, Aristotle, ev... Don't do that. Don't do that. Newton, Einstein, Hawking? It's a big world. Strange things happen all the time. Occam's razor. That's why I'm a scientist. The simplest explanation is most likely to be true. Well, this is also pretty simple, brainiac. All right, the Creeper comes back every 23rd spring. It kills for 23 days... Then what? Then it disappears. I don't know. Sounds like a love bug. They were a breed of bugs made in a lab to kill mosquitos. All they did was mate and die. Complete failure. Now they serve zero purpose. They have no function, but twice a year they appear like a storm, blindly chasing anything white before dying when they come into contact with it. So, you think the Creeper was made in a lab. I think the Creeper was made in your brain, you half-wit. Well, the Creeper doesn't mate. It kills... It's said to have killed almost hundreds, maybe thousands. Wait, didn't they make a movie out of it? Creepy Creeper or something? Three actually, but none of that is real. And it was named after a cheesy LA cable access show... Baby? Baby! Laine! Baby, I told you that burrito would come back to haunt you. Ugh... Erm... Pffff, all right, you know I suck at typing. Erm... I'm gonna ask her tonight. I've got the ring so... Wish me luck. I love you, Mom. What is up girl? How are you? Everything hurts and I'm dying. Oh, that good, huh? Ew, are you all right? It's too late for me, save yourself. So, did you take the test yet? I brought it with me, but I think this counts as a positive. You are always the optimist. Not at all what I meant and you know it. Well, I was trying to hold it till I got there, but I need to tinkle, tailor, my soldier spy. I'm gonna have to call you back. I'm not hearing this. Just call me when you get to the hotel, okay? Oh, oh, oh... Oh, make sure that you do not puke on those Air Force Ones. Don't even joke about that. Laine, when have I ever joked about fashion? Sam, I swear if you jinxed me, I swear to God I'll... Laine, I love you, but you're buying me some more shoes. Fuck... Do I look like I'm built for the woods? Agghhh! You bring me to the most charming places. Remind me why we're here again? Baby, I can't wait to show you this place. Are you sure this is where we're supposed to be? Yeah, we should be close. Now you know that's where we're going... Really? Lady Manilla, how could you not?! Hey, maybe she'll read your palm. Yeah! Trust you to find the strangest place to ask for directions. Damn, look at all this cool stuff. I don't get it. Come on, Chase, nobody's here, let's go. Chase, don't touch everything. You scared the shit out of me! Take a look at this. I didn't know they had whaling this far from the coast. Anything strike your fancy? We're looking for this address, but I can't find it on any map. Ah, it's not on any maps. The satellites are kind of screwed up over our town I guess. There. And we are here. Just take 68 five miles to south and turn left when you see the signs. Uh, thanks. No problem. That'll be $50 please? 50... It's antique, honey. Antique, okay. Now you come back any time, you hear. Oh, and congratulations to you both. Oh, he doesn't know? Neither does she. Interesting. Okay, this was, er... We have a tree bearing fruit. He will be most pleased. Wow, look at this. Are we the only ones in this place? Babe... Wait there. I've got another surprise for you. Chase, where are you going? Hey, this is Sam. I'm just busy living my best life. Sam, where the hell are you? Boo! Mah! What is it? It's your surprise. Are you serious? What are those? We're gonna cosplay. You and me. I brought everything we need. All you need to do is choose who you wanna be. I'm not putting on any of them. What? Yeah... Yeah, I mean it was a stupid idea anyway. So, I mean, I knew you wouldn't wear some of this stuff. It's tacky anyway, so I don't even want you to wear it. Maybe I'll wear it. I dunno. - Can I watch? - No! Coming to you live from Horror Hound 2021. I'm Carrie and I'm here to find the biggest Creeper... Hey Laine, they're talking about the Creeper. The one in the YouTube clip. So, clown outfits tell me more. Well, they say that clowns are frightening but I say that we are everything good and bad in life all at once. Look at all the love the clowns... Mommy's gonna paint these streets with blood. Stumbling around in our little old and shattered community... Try this on. And guess who else might turn up... Okay, Mr. J. That's right, local horror legend, the Creeper. Now that I've satisfied your fanboy fantasies, what are you gonna wear? What? Oh, this. A T-shirt? Not just any T-shirt. This T-shirt. What am I gonna do with you? Ahhh! Laine?! Baby, you all right? It's just a bird. Scared the crap out of me. Babe... Let's start going... It's party time. Come on. Ahhh! I had no idea so many people attended these things. This is the Coachella of cosplay. Yeah, for psycho killers. It looks like a gathering of juggalos. Oh please, you love Insane Clown Posse. I've seen your Spotify. Stay off my phone you stalker! And the angel answered and said unto the people, fear not, ye, for I know ye seek the Messiah. For it is risen. Hallelujah! I'm pretty sure the correct phrase is, "He is risen." Agh... ahhh! Argh! Argh... aggghhh! Argh! Aaargh! Aaagghhh! Jesus Christ! Aah! That's right, welcome to Horror Hound! Let's go! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! Wow, these people are really fucked up. You should have seen your face... hook, line, and sinker. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Shitting their pants. The looks on their faces. Shit. Mmm... mmmm. Urgh! Aagghhh! They are glorifying actual killers and you're honestly okay with that? No... No, they're not. It's all just for fun. What if there's a psycho lurking in the crowd? How the hell would you know? Baby, there's no psychos. Just a bunch of people having fun. Even big music festivals have a body count. I dread to think what it's like here. Crowds of people, everyone drinking, partying, cars... Sharp things. Chase... Okay, I'll get the drinks. Hey. I'm doing that right freaking now. The sign says "closed." Chase! You cut yourself, Sir? Sorry folks, I got held up preparing for tonight's big show. Special effects and such. No big deal. It's three for five, pick them from the center. Er... - Is that all right? - Great. From here? In the center. Center. - All right, cool. Baby, stand back and watch... me... work! That was close! I'm gonna use my other hand, okay? Babe, you watching? Ah, okay, it's my last one. You like that? I've never seen anything like this. That's because they're all unique. Each one handmade. Creeper style. You ever heard of the Creeper? Don't get him started. It... it's like a local legend, right? Kills hundreds of people every 23 years? Something like that. I told... Now you try. Me? No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. - You're doing this. You are doing this. You're doing this. Come on, this way. Successfully throwing blades at a human target was an art form. Now, first you find your throwing line... That's this. Okay, now the key to successfully throwing a blade is the distance between you and the target. Now, if you've found your throwing line, you're gonna take a step back. And you're gonna turn 45 degrees and to your left. Okay, now you're gonna step up to that line and throw it just like a baseball pitch. Hard as you can. Hmm. What! Baby, that was sick! So, how is this related to the Creeper? They say these are some of his favourite toys. Seems inefficient. To prolong the hunt. There is the minor drawback that even if you hit your target, you throw away your weapon. You need something else to finish the job. Hmm... Or if the Creeper throws like Chase, then he would need it. Oh, she got jokes today. Ow! Ah, damn it. I got it, I got it. Just a cut, just a cut. Boy Scout. Always be prepared. You guys coming to the big Creeper Draw? Mm... What's the draw? Starts just before midnight after the cosplay show on the main stage. You guys should definitely check it out. Who knows, you might even win. Ow! Baby, it's all right, it's a cut. Are you all right there, Princess? Come on, come on. You all right? Ahhhhh! Hey, you're here for the Creeper Draw, right? Any idea where Brent is? Has anybody seen Brent? Anybody at all? Did he do the arrow stunt already? The arrow guy? We filmed him. We got it on tape, right Mikey? Yeah, yeah, it's on tape. Well then, where the hell is he? I mean we're supposed to be on stage in five minutes. All right, Brent's gonna get his ass kicked for this. Listen Carrie, I'm afraid you're gonna have to do this one alone. I mean, Brent's not here and it's nearly midnight. Come on, I'll show you the ropes. It's easy. - Perfect. Jamie, grab my stuff please? What you're gonna do is you're just gonna... Oh, can I get a ginger tea before I go on? No, you absolutely cannot. All right! Thank you for the show, uh, sexy version of Jason, I think. Anyway, congrats. Hey, come on, let's check this out. It is time for our Creeper Draw! And revealing our grand prize is former Miss Universe, Princess of Darkness, our Master of Ceremonies... Madame Carnage! Argh! Silence, you peasants! I have travelled the world injecting fear into the hearts of mere mortals like y'all. But we are here for something very, very special, the Horror Hound Festival. It's the devil child of my making 'cause it's back in my spiritual home of Jackson, Louisiana! The very place that through the ages we have lured and devoured sad souls like y'all. Come on now, carnage! Ya-whoo! So, tell us what the grand prize is. An escape room for two, Creeper themed. A haunted little house for all you creepy little freaks. That's right, creeps, the unlucky winners of our grand draw will be taken at will to the historic Barnabett house where you will thirst for disturbing myths. And the bloody macabre will be tested to the limit in an escape room with a difference. Accompanied by internet sensation... There, you heard her. The Creeper's a real thing! I don't think anybody knew what she was talking about. But okay, I give you that, it's niche. And there are other people that believe it too, so you're not a complete freak after all. You're loving every single second of this ain't you, you big nerd? - I prefer biologist. - Oh, yeah. And now, to draw the winner, Jackson's very own Lady Manilla! Number... 5... 1... 4! - Oh my God, that's me. - What? How is that possible? I never win anything. Its voodoo, baby. 514 is us! Yeah! All right! That handsome guy over there is our winner! Can you believe this? Thanks! And remember if you get out by daybreak, you'll win a special prize. Now, round of applause for our winner. Come on backstage and we'll get you guys going in no time! That was amazing. Right this way, just watch your head. Do you really wanna do this? I mean... It's the Creeper house! I know everything there is to know about the Creeper. We'll be out of there in no time. Yeah, I know, but... Trust me... trust me! Congratulations, right this way. It's just through here. There we are. Okay, just sign there and there. - Uh, what are these? - Standard release form. We get to use your image forever and ever, ever in the universe. We're not liable if anything goes wrong. The usual blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Uh, but why? Oh sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Jamie, the producer of her show. We're coming along to film all this. It's part of our deal with the festival. Hey Laine, we're gonna be on TV! Internet, not TV. Even better. Sign me up. All right! Just down there, Miss. In your own time. Okay, all right, team, let's go! Let's move it! Hey there, winner. - I'm Carrie. - Carrie. Nice to meet you. Laine, the drooling jerk is Chase, my boyfriend. How are we gonna get there? Uh, Stu's going to take us there, so follow me. "Follow me." You'd better be right about getting us out of there quick sharp. Baby, come on. Thank you. I can't believe this is happening. The horror gods are on our side. Chase, isn't that the guy... You wanna take a look at this? What am I looking at? Guys, are we really going there in that thing? Don't worry, he looks a little bit creepy, but he's a sweetheart. A bit? Go on, get in. Hey, wanna get killed by a crazy redneck? Because that's how you get killed. Come on, you two. I love you. Are you ready for the big night of terror to begin? We've got ten seconds to go! 10! 9! 8! 7! 6! 5! 4! 3! 2! 1! Hey, play some music, the crowd's going wild out there! - The internet dropped, man. - Well, do something! All right, folks, we're out of wi-fi, but never fear. A good DJ never leaves the house without a few vinyls! So you're not gonna talk to me for the whole journey? At all? - What is that? B-roll. What is that? - Baby... - Shadow? Can you at least look at me? I'm not sure. It looks like a Creeper. Wait, wait, wait, you mean to tell me you got the Creeper on tape? This is real footage? Well, a Creeper. It's probably just some asshole in great cosplay. Or is it? What's the resolution on that? Native 4k, why? See? Crisp, clear optics makes no difference. Great. If that John guy turns out to be missing we might have something. This is interesting. Uh, yeah. So I guess I light this using cellphones? Welcome to the Barnabett family cemetery. This was the final resting place for souls back to the 1700s. The natives believed that this was holy ground. Back to the dawn of man. Sacred. But very, very haunted. Awesome. I wonder if I could be buried here. Uh, be careful what you wish for. Shut up. What are we doing here again? Weren't we supposed to go to the haunted house or something? Yeah. We walk from here. You see that? What's wrong? Come on, we gotta get this. Camera won't work. I dunno. No, no, no, dunno ain't gonna cut it, pal. I didn't pay you to bring the film crew down to Whistling Dixie for my health. Now what do you mean it won't work? It doesn't turn on? It won't focus? Won't record? Won't fuck itself? What am I even doing out here? See, now, nobody wants to sound like that guy. I have got an Emmy, God damn it. Laine... Laine! I don't give a fuck about your Emmy. It's not my fault the camera doesn't work. Laine! You can go fuck yourself. You're such an asshole sometimes. Laine! Babe, is everything all right? I don't know, you tell me. Is everything all right? What do you mean? I know there's something going on there with that blonde bimbo and you. Honestly, it doesn't bother me. I just find it so "interesting." Oh, come on. I didn't even notice her! - Really? "Awesome, bury me here please, I'm a bimbo!" You want me to give you a cup to catch your drool? No, I didn't say it like that. And that's not fair. Laine! No, really, I love her. She's deep, I get it. Come on, I... Hello? Hey, are you with the festival? It's me, Michael! The camera guy... hey! Do you have a phone? I just need a bit of a tethering in order to get my stuff online. Look, I only need it for a bit. My producer's gonna kill me if I don't get this stuff online right now. Hello? Fuck! Well shit... Argh! Aaagghh! What are you looking for, your banjo? - Aagh! - Ahh! Jesus, man... fuck! Your face! Oh, I did pee myself a little. Now we can go. Where are the others? Michael? Michael! Where has that no good shit for brains gone to? This is definitely the last gig I'm working with him. I'm a YouTuber, get me out of here! Ugh, it was nothing! I just wanted to see what was on that vide... Oh... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait... You're jealous. - I'm not jealous. - You're jealous. Mm, it's cute. Jealousy is the sign of a weak mind. So, bimbo jokes. Wait, baby... Laine... No! Maybe something got him? Like a big animal. There are no big animals 'round here. Come on, this is Louisiana! There's like... gators, snakes and black fucking bears roaming all around. They wouldn't come here. Laine! Laine! - Laine! - Hey man! Hey... hey, man, take it easy! What's going on? Where's your girlfriend? Some... Something big took... I told you, black fucking bear! Bears don't fly. Now calm down, man. What happened? We have to go. We have to go, call the police. What? Call the fucking police! Ugh! Oh, fuck! It's Michael... oh! Something got him. It's fresh. Really fresh. If something got him, it's still out here. Inside. Quick! Argh! Agghhhhh! Laine! Oh, be careful. It's an old house, you dunno what's in here. - Open up! - God damn it! Hey! - Open up! - God damn it. Hey! Hey! - They're all yours now. - Come on. Come on! Fucking shut! - Come on, you assholes! - Open up! - God damn it! - Hey! What the fuck? Come on! Fucking shut! So this is your escape room, huh? Is this some kind of game you're playing here? 'Cause you can stop the show and open the door. We're all very scared of your hillbilly tricks. Shut your fuckin' mouth. Hey! Open up! Hey! I didn't sign up for that. Michael's dead and you all saw it. Now open that fucking door. What did you do with Laine? Where is she! Hey! Calm down. I don't know, all right? I wasn't even supposed to be here! All I was hired to do was scare ya up a bit. And that's all. Hired? Hired by who? Giselle... Manilla. She said there's a surprise waiting here for you. A surprise? I'll show you a fucking surprise. You tell me where Laine is right now or I'll stick this thing so far up your ass, you'll taste the fuckin' metal. Yeah, hillbilly, it's time to start talking. All of you take a step fuckin' back! Woah, woah, woah! Or I'll blow your fuckin' brains out! My ears are fucking ringing! I warned you! Step back! Jesus, Stu, you didn't have to fire that thing! Next time I do, you won't hear anything anymore. Okay, let's figure this out. It's an escape room, right? It's not a fucking escape room. It's a trap. And who's the trapper? The Creeper. The Creeper's a fairytale, son. I saw it. You guys are fucking nuts. It's got Laine and I'm gonna find her. - We're staying put. - What? Oh, don't tell me, this interrupts your hectic schedule of country hick incest and intermittent horse loving. Fuck you, Hollywood. Hey! Hey! We've gotta start working as a team. So as difficult as I know it is for you, I need you to stop being a fuckin' asshole! You're stuck with us now. Put it down. Put the gun down. Put the gun down. Nobody's going anywhere until I find Laine. It's coming. Upstairs, now! Go to the attic! Ah... ahh! When we were outside, I saw a light in here. I'll find a switch. The roof is leaking. But it's not raining. Ah... ahh! Oh, you gotta be shitting me! Who the hell is that? That's Sam... Oh, what the hell is that?! You're real. Agghh! - Ugh! - Where is she! Where is she! Where is she! Get off me! Talk to me! Get off me! Get off me! Help! Ahh! Ah! Agghh! Argh! Ugh! Chase! Help! Help! Where the hell did she go? She's gotta be here somewhere. Come on, Carrie! Carrie! Argh! Ugh! Aggh! Ugh! Ugh! Aggh! Ahhhh! Fuck. Aghhh! Agggh! Carrie! Hey, hey. It's coming... it's coming! Where's Laine... where's Laine? - I don't know. - Where is she? Where is Laine? - I don't know. I don't know. - Where is she? What's that? In here... In here. Go! Come on. There's no way out. We're just gonna have to kill it. Yeah, with a rolling pin. It won't work. It's immortal, trust me. Our only hope is it loses interest in us, or we wait out the hunting cycle. And how long is the hunting cycle? 23 days. We're fucked. We are fucked. I'm getting a real sense of déjà vu. Laine! Laine! - Ah... ahh... ahhh! Laine, it's me! It's me, it's me, it's me. Laine, please, please! It's me, baby, it's me. What happened, baby? - We have to get out of here! What... what happened to you? He'll get you all! Anyone who's near me. - Baby, you're bleeding. - It's me it wants. The only way out is upstairs. Let's go. Let's go! Everybody stick together. I got you, I got you. - Oh, the phone! - Wait! Aggghhh! Oh, fuck! Oh, my leg! Oh... oh, fuck! No-ho-ho! Agh, my leg! Oh, fuck! Oh... oh! 911, what's your emergency? Erm... What's your location, sir? Where the hell are we? - The Barnabett House. - The Barnabett House! - Sir? - Yeah. What's the problem, sir? The... the... the Creeper. Something is trying to kill us. Have you been taking drugs... Sir? Do I sound like a fuckin' stoner to you? I need you to get some help to the Barnabett House or I swear to God... Sir, are you okay? - Fuck, please! - Come on, let's go! Let's go! Come on! Hold him, hold him! Agh! Come on! Oh, shit! Quick, quick. Baby... Wait, what? Why are you stopping? Even if we get outside we're sitting ducks out there. Help me over here. Do we risk it or hole up in here? I vote hunker down. The police are coming, so that will slow the Creeper down. Are they? Well, they're not just gonna ignore a 911 call, right? Oh, my sweet summer child. Oh fuck, I need a fucking doctor! We're like flies in a spider's web. It's calling the shots. The only way we end this is to kill it. Well, your boyfriend said we can't, so... I'm not so sure. I've seen it up close. How then? It's old and decrepit. It stinks of death. Well, where the hell is it, anyway? It's toying with us. He likes to play. We need to trap it. With what? - Carrie! - Run! Fuck! Go, take him! - Carrie! - Agh! Carrie! Carrie! Come on! Aghh! No! No! No! Quick... quick! Come on! Here, here, here! Quick! What the f... Holy Mary, mother of God. Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen. Amen. What is this place? Ahhhh! What can you see? Jesus! Oh, fuck. Looks like it's gone. It took Carrie. Oh no. No, Jesus! Oh, fuck. No, please, Lord, not like this. No, not like this. Maybe there's something in here that can help us. Maybe, erm, information or... One way or another, we're done running. Yeah, literally. I don't understand how this place isn't burnt to the ground yet. - Please? - Oh, shi... I'd give my left arm for... Careful, you might. Yeah, I instantly regretted saying that. Sorry man. Yeah, it's just nerves. What the hell is that? Voodoo doll? What the... Holy son of Jesus. Guys, the stone. Baby, wait... Oh my God, they're feeding it. Baby, why did you say he was after you? Where did it... Where did it take you? What really happened? - Chase, I'm pregnant. That's why it's after me. What? It wants what I've got. And, yes... I will marry you... If we ever get out of here alive. But why the hell would they be feeding this thing? Look at all this crap. What is this? A shrine? I thought these were stories. Legends. But it all seems real. And what, it has a cult fan club that helps feed this thing? Then maybe they want one of us. What? We can't fight it. But we can beat it, maybe even stop it. We're in its twisted web right now. But it's time to turn the tables. We need a plan. I think I know what we need to do. Go, go, go, go... Ah! - Agh! - Stu! Agh! Ugh! I've got him, I've got him! Aggh! Argh! Argh! Come on, asshole! Ugh! Take the baby, its life force belongs to you. Live forever, take the baby. Its life force belongs to you. Live forever, take the baby. Its life force belongs to you. You can't have it! Ugh! Come on. Ugh! - Ugh! - Argh! How do you like those peepers, bitch? Now! Aghh! Oh, no. Aggh, get off! Get off! - Aggh! - Stu, no! Agh! Stu! Laine!
