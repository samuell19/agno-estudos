BAGATELLE INTERNATIONAL ROSE CONTEST Don't bang the roses together! Be careful with the bumps and holes. Go left. THE ROSE MAKER It's heavy. You didn't have to get 4,000 brochures. Maybe you can help me? Turn for Christ's sake! Come on! Wait. Hold this! -The Vernet Roses. -Hello, Madam. Exhibit 86. But hurry, the jury's on its way. Your booth is... We didn't take one this year. Really? Madam Vernet, I told you. We can't afford it. Give me that. You're on now, Véra! Our new rose "Montherlant." Hello, the Vernet Roses. Please check out our new rose, "Montherlant." No, thank you. Hi, Eve. Another pearly white. It's pretty. The roses I create-- That your employees create for you. How do you expect to survive with just one new product a year? I heard you've been having trouble. It hurts me, you know. Well, I'll go away. See you at the cocktail party? It's on me. What an asshole! Excuse me. So, how's it going? Good? We should have called it "Sophie Marceau." I already said no actresses. We want things that last. Ladies, our best seller: "Beyoncé." No, thank you. Mr. Lestrade! Hello! Did you give Mr. Lestrade our brochure? I'm meeting Mr. Lamarzelle. I'll stop by your booth later. See you. Don't just stand there. Dear Friends, may I have your attention. The time has come for our coveted grand prize, the "Golden Rose." This year, again, we will reward an exceptional rose. It is therefore my pleasure and unique honor to give our "Golden Rose" to "Ruby Lolita," a "Lamarzelle" creation. Thank you very much. It's the eighth time in a row, I believe, the Lamarzelle house has been awarded. I'm speechless. Thank you so much. It's over. Don't say that. You'll bounce back, Madame Vernet. You've done great things. There's always a solution. What solution? There's no solution! Temperatures are rising starting today. This afternoon between 68 and 77 degrees in Lille, 75 degrees in Paris. Thank you, Alain. Tomorrow, the French Board of Labor will publish its annual report. We will report back to you in the morning. Madam Vernet? Madam Vernet? Anybody here? Madam Vernet? Is anyone here? -Yes? -Good morning. I'm Mr. Papandreou. I'm here with your new staff. No, I'm sorry, it's a mistake. Excuse me! I was on the phone. I contacted you. I have the signed forms. Well then... They'll introduce themselves. It's a good exercise. I'm not rehabilitating here. Look at them. Relax, okay? Everything's going to be fine. -I have to go. -Okay. -Have a nice day. -Good day! Véra. -What's going on? -That's my solution. We can't afford seasonal workers. Do they know we can't pay them? They're exempt from charges. It's much cheaper. -In the name of what? -Rehabilitation. Where did you find them? An association. They have horticultural background? That's the thing. We have to train them. Is there a problem with us? -No. No. -I'll be right there. Thank you, Véra. Fuck, it smells like old lady here. So... I hope you like roses. Put your phone away. Thank you. What are those shoes? Flip-flops. Let's start from the beginning. To reproduce a rose, we grow rootstocks first. The rootstocks are the wild roses, of no aesthetic interest, to which we graft creation roses. The graft. For example, we have here a stem on which we're going to graft the neighboring roses. Here, two centimeters above, two centimeters below, we put the graft after we make a T, then you ligate. And it's done. There you go. That's it. Anyways, you won't do this right now. Don't worry. The other employees do it? There are no other employees. We are a small family business. You take care of this all alone? Yes. We hire on a case-by-case basis. Thank God for cheap labor! -Excuse me? -Nothing. How long do you plan on keeping us? How am I supposed to know? We'll see. One thing at a time. So, we reproduce July to September, then pluck the rose bushes. When do we make bouquets? -What? -When do we make bouquets? We're not florists. We sell bare roots or in pots. Come on, follow me. Here you have the patented roses I gave birth to. You gave birth to roses? Yes! You think you just find roses anywhere in nature... growing on trees? You're completely uneducated. No, I hybridize roses. I invent roses in the two greenhouses over there. No entry allowed. These are my best sellers, all multi-award winners, "Annapurna," "The Queen of Violets," and "Madame Beaumarchais." It's beautiful. Smells so good. These are my latest creations. I've done a thorough job these last years on the pearly ones, and the subtleties of reflection. Observe the nuances. Come closer. Smells like nothing. Yes... No... The pearly ones don't have a pronounced perfume. Come on, follow me. Take this. It'll be more convenient for work. And it'll coordinate your outfits. You have a rose tattoo? No, it's a lion. For the band "The Lion." "The Lion..." It's a rose too, you know. Besides... Wait! China. No, it's not that one. "Rosa Wichuraiana." Ideally, I'll need someone at the shop. And two people in the fields to weed and spread fertilizer. By any chance, do one of you know how to use a cash register? Hello, The Vernet Roses. I'm calling about our March order. We still haven't received it. Yes, indeed. We didn't pay the last one. But it's probably on its way. As for you, gentlemen, weed the rows behind the big greenhouses over there. I have things to do. Yes, of course we sent the payment. Not six months. Five months and three weeks. Please, be precise! I was wondering about the order you canceled in August... February! Yes, February. I would like to know the reason why... Really? Yeah, well, fuck you! I can't believe this! Who turned the heat up?! It was cold this morning-- Who told you to touch that?! "Set on four for daytime and six at night." That's during winter! No natural disasters for over a year. Then you arrived. You burned 200 rosebushes all at once! You fucking idiots! You need to respect us or I'll call a lawyer. Well... I'm fed up. You're fired! What? That's not fair! I wasn't even there! I was working out in the greenhouse. Good, let's start with you. Come on. I think your probation officer will appreciate it. November 2015, theft with violence. March 2016, criminal conspiracy. January 2018, gang violence. You're getting more prestigious. And then, breaking and entering. One, two, three, four, five, six burglaries. What's your business? Pensioners? Jewelers? No, warehouses. Stocks of goods. But I stopped. -Isn't it full of security? -Yeah. You just need to be prepared. You got caught each time. That's not true or else the case would've been bigger. You remember that I create roses? So, I had the project to put these two parents together. With these two roses, I can create a luminous rose, disease resistant and highly fragrant. It could be a hit in contests! So, it turns out that "Wichuraiana" I have, but "The Lion" is in the hands of an asshole who keeps everything to himself. That's too bad. I'm not going to let it happen. And you're going to help me. You want me to boost some roses? -Excuse me? -Boost, swipe. You know, steal. No, let's say, "borrow." I got early release and you want me to go back? Your early release depends on your rehabilitation, right? What are you doing? I'm giving them a second chance. I'll explain the job to them and the new market rules. -In the hangar? -Yes. This is "Rosa Wichuraiana," a very strong botanical rose. Very bright. It's from China and no one has hybridized it yet. Here we have "The Lion..." an old rose created by Pernet-Duchet in 1848. Unfortunately, very fragile and rare. I've got her perfume here. Smell this. -It's strong! -Yes, it's a powerful scent. It's classified as the most fragrant in the world. Multiple award-winning. Unfortunately, its owner refuses to lend the parents, like we've always done. He privatizes the plants in order to strangle out its competitors. I think I found it. Good job! That's it. Here is the production zone. Behind the wall is the Lamarzelle Castle. Do you know where "The Lion" is? No. We'll have to scout around. We need a driver and a spotter. Madame Vernet is offering you a second chance now. What? You want us to steal? No, Nadège, no. These are Bach flowers... Essential oils. It's helpful. Take this. I've already explained, we are not the thieves! Forget about it. I'm out. It's over. I'm not doing it with them. Look at them, they're useless. Go find some professionals then! Professionals? To rob roses? I'm not willing to take a risk to keep this job. Maybe that's the problem, Samir. You wouldn't be in rehabilitation, you'd have a permanent contract. She lost a lot of money because of me with the roasted rosebuds. -What is she saying? -I don't know. Let's say I'm okay going after the big business. I still won't agree without a quid pro quo. What's in it for us? Well... um... See! A boss never thinks about the quid pro quo! If I win a prize, I'll give you a percentage. No, no, no! That's another trick to confuse us. I'd prefer something more solid. You talked about permanent contracts. -A permanent contract? -Yes. Permanent or nothing. I want an apartment. What do you want? -A permanent contract too. -You know how much that costs?! We have no other choice. Okay, fine. You have my word. Let's put it in writing. So, I commit... I'll take the percentage. I have something important on Friday. Yes, fine. -Véra's coming. -Not a word to Véra. -She's too honest to understand. -Really? Excuse me, but... Do you really have to take my car? Well, yes, Véra. These are cost-saving measures. It uses a lot less gas than the van. And this field trip is essential? You wanted me to train them, right? The business environment is important. Our buyers and sellers, the competitors, the distributors, etc... And Fred's hourly obligations is... I have an authorization. The shelter gave it to me. No worries. We'll be back in two days. It'll be fine. What are you doing here? Fred told me to drive. I prefer when a man drives. What does that mean? Aren't you tired of that bag? It's not a bag, it's a fanny pack. Who took a perfume shower? We're going to an actual castle. Who wants a pill for motion sickness? Cut the crap! Are you sure they won't notice we changed the rosebush? Stop stressing us out! You're a pain the ass. Do you ever talk nicely? As long as you don't piss me off. HI, STILL OKAY FOR FRIDAY? Writing to your girlfriend? What do you care? You're watching me? He's writing to his mama! Eat your M&M's and don't fuck with me. -Oh, all right, calm down! -Drive! This is it. This isn't a fucking girly company! Enough with your sexist remarks. -No, I mean it's not a faggot thing. -Don't talk like that! You could hurt someone! It's homophobic! What if Samir were gay! What do you have against gays, women, and everybody? We're listening. I don't know! Get off my back! If that's all you have to say. I can go. -Don't forget this. -Right, thank you. See you later. Eve Vernet, I have an appointment with Mr. Lamarzelle. Just a minute. I have Madame Vernet for Mr. Lamarzelle. RECEPTION DELIVERIES -All good, you can go. -Thank you. LAMARZELLE THE ROSES OF EXCELLENCY Eve! Welcome! Your phone call surprised me. You finally accepted my invitation to come see me. Let me show you the greenhouses. We started hydroponics this year. It's much more effective. -Impressive. -It's nice, right? Here we have 400,000 cuttings. We don't graft anymore. By heating and using rooting hormones, we produce twice as fast. The roses won't be very resistant. They'll only last 5/6 years. After that, they'll buy something else. Anyway, it's for the Chinese market. Come here, this should interest you. How much do you sow per year? 300 to 400 seeds. Oh yeah, pretty good. We do 250,000! I have a team of six who hybridize. You could be their boss. You're a talented creator, Eve. You created some landmark roses. My talent is business. So, us two together, we could go very far. We could create a prestige line with your name... "Vernet Prestige." What do you think? What could interest me... is working with rare fathers and mothers. This is the perfect spot. I've just increased my collection. -Really? -You want to see it? -Why not? -Follow me. It's pretty secure, huh? I change it every day. I hope you're not car sick. There. It's a pretty nice collection. I bought Fisher in Geneva. Beales in Leads. Now we have about 2,000 cultivars, including a lot of rarities. This collection was my father's dream. -We're not going in? -Join my team. You'll have a pass. Scroll to the other ones. You messed them all up. You just had one button! The glasses system didn't work. -I knew it! -Yeah, right. No, it's not... We can't see a thing. There's a camera! We can see it well. The door to access the park, the code changes every day. Yeah, okay, I see. There's an alarm. -I can handle it. I'll do a shunt. -A shunt? It's an electrical thing. I'll take care of it. The greenhouse is locked. No big deal, but I'm worried about the security guard. I timed his runs and it's not enough for us to stall. We need to get rid of him. What? -Isn't that a bit extreme? -We just need a diversion. Someone needs to take care of it. I'm the only one who knows the place. So I need to stay inside. Oh shit! Give me that! Come on, hurry! Do you have a problem? Hello, sir. My car broke down at the worst time. -Can I have a look? -Yes, please. Give me the wire. -Fuck, it's too short. -What? Change of plan. We both can't go inside. Keep the wires connected or it sets off the alarm. Hold the wires. Why me? You'd rather go and pick a lock? Come on, take both ends. -Wait. -What? Look, it's this one. -Not another one. -All right. Hold them. Don't worry, it's low voltage. It doesn't hurt. Don't let go, otherwise the alarm will go off. Plant the rose bush like I showed you. -You need to call a tow truck. -No, we can't afford it. I knew we shouldn't have agreed to go see your mom! Is your husband giving you trouble? What are you implying? She's emotional. Shut up! I'm not talking to you! -You're a racist! -What!? I'm racist? You know where I'm from? The Beau-Brown district! My brothers are Algerians! You're still a racist! -I'll shut you up! -Oh really? Finally! What took you so long? What the hell happened with the alarm? How wonderful! I haven't seen it in over 20 years. You don't want to smell it? We don't have time. Hurry up! The door is the contact now. You really didn't understand? They're not here. Where are they? Fucking charity cases! What are you doing? I'm going to hybridize. Can we watch you do it? No. It's too important. Unbelievable. Can we at least have some coffee? We helped you. I almost lost an eye! Shit! This is how you thank us? We could rat you out! Shut the fuck up. Véra's coming! Hello. What are you all doing here so early? Yes, Véra! We're still in training here. She's going to teach us how to hybridize. Great, we're going to see your work. You guys are lucky. No one's allowed inside her greenhouse. What happened to you? Oh no, it's nothing, I'm fine. Well... What happened? I wasn't driving. That can't be possible. But... -Shut up and say nothing. -We're going to prison? -Hello, Gentlemen. -Madame Vernet? Yes, follow me. We're looking for Madame Vernet. Yes? There's been a robbery. We think it's a gang who goes after companies. We're warning everyone to be vigilant. A gang? They stole the stereo from Harvey's. We don't think you're at risk. This isn't valuable stuff. What kind of idiot robs roses? -There are some rare ones. -Shh... Don't we know each other? I don't think so. Do you buy a lot of roses? No. Is the lady okay? Yes, she's fine. She's ultra sensitive to birch pollen. That's all. Have a good day. Good day, sir. -Goodbye. -Thanks for warning us. Well... I'll let you train them, but I need to see you. It's important. Okay. You ready? It seems lighter than I remember. So, in order to hybridize... First of all, we collect pollen from "Wichuraiana." We delicately collect... the pollen grains, without losing one. This part is invaluable. Right here. There. And now, the most delicate part. The wedding. We gently remove the petals. Right here. We undress the rose. We release the pistil. Don't cut it off. It doesn't bloom much, so if we break the reproductive organ... Stay focused. Now, we have to bag the whole thing to avoid natural pollination. Oh yeah, no bastards, right? Yes, exactly. We select the best fathers and mothers. That's eugenics! Yes, a little. We are hoping that the chromosomes are assembling while keeping the best traits of both parents. We won't know until it blooms. Nothing indicates if it will become a specimen of value. Recessive and dominant genes. What? I went to school. Then, Madame Vernet? What did you want to tell me? We just lost Bourg-la-Reine. 11,000 euros less per year. Vernet Roses... It's the receiver. Let me talk to him. Hello, Madame Vernet . I'm legally obligated to inform you that a buyer has made an offer to buy your company. Out of the question. I'll never sell. If you close and go in receivership, this could save your staff. What do I care? If things don't turnaround, I'll close. No one will take over my father's name. That's it. Goodbye, sir. SEPTEMBER HARVEST -- SEEDS SEEDING DECEMBER TRANSPLANTATION APRIL HYBRIDS BLOOM JUNE BAGATELLE CONTEST What the fuck?! What's fucking happening?! What are you soaking me for? Shit, you scared me! What are you doing here? It's none of your business. Are you kidding? This is my home! Who allowed you to leave this morning? This isn't a hotel! You won't be paid. I don't give a shit. Okay? Why aren't you at the shelter? I was late. It was closed. I couldn't go in. What are you saying? I'm calling them now. No. I'll tell them you made me do it! You're blackmailing me? What did you do? You shouldn't have said yes. You've got to be fucking kidding! Like I had a choice? It's just you and your shitty roses! I'm making the call. Wait! If you call them, I'll be in trouble. I'm not bothering anyone. It bothers me. Fuck. You're a fucking selfish bitch. How dare you! I didn't spend my day doing nothing. What do you know about my day? Do you want to hear my day? I was supposed to see my parents. They never came. I waited for hours. I don't know where they live. They don't answer the phone. It's been four years. For four fucking years I haven't seen my parents. How's that for a day? You have a big home. How many people live here? No husband. No children. Alone and just fine. Who's the old geezer in the picture? My father. The roses were his life. It was just the two of us, so it became my life too. That's it. Dead or alive? He passed away 15 years ago. He left me his dreams... and all the shit that goes with it. I need to tell you something. Getting your rosebush wasn't easy. There were two that were the same. The name tags were mixed up. There was "The Lion" tag and the second was "Soleil d'or," I think. So what? I have them. Which one did you take? If I hybridized "Soleil d'or," it won't repeat-flowering. No chance to compete. This one. Yes, it's the good one. How'd you do it? They almost smell the same. I smelled it last time in the bottle. You still remember after a week? Well, yeah. You have an olfactory sensitivity. I have no sensitivity. We should test you. You might be gifted. I have no gift, okay! And no tests! This never ends well for me. Well, we'll talk later. I'll go get you a blanket and a pillow. I called your shelter. I told them we finished late and that I needed you. There. Well, thanks. -You're already here? -I slept here. You took him in? Yes, so what? What's going on here? It belongs to the co-op, since we can't pay. And next time it's the vans. This is a disaster. How can we hold on until the contest? I can't believe this. Find a solution, Véra. I don't know. Come on, Véra. Well... So... We need to earn more money. Why? Is there a problem? Are you going bankrupt? What about the permanent contracts? -What permanent contract? -Nothing. What do you mean "nothing"? I promised a contract if we turnaround. You didn't say, "if we turnaround." It was implied! No company, no contracts. No need for a college degree to understand that. You're really a scumbag. -Careful, Samir. -What about? Calm down! Enough. What's the deal? Insolvency. I can't fucking believe it! If she wants to pay you, save the staff and hang on, we need to increase the sales. We have to sell more roses. How much do have to sell? 300 rosebushes more a week. Is that a lot or a little? Follow me. It's about that much. All that uh... All the way to the back. We'll never make it. Why bother with roses when we can grow weed in the greenhouses. No, we're sticking to roses. When do people buy a lot of roses? Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, but they've already passed. All Saints' Day, but that's not for us. Why not? For cemeteries, it's chrysanthemums, not roses. Why not? It's not the flowering season. Can't you change the season? Technically, we could force them into a greenhouse. But the tradition is chrysanthemums. Just because there's nothing else. True. If there are roses, maybe people would prefer... They have a point. Anyways we can't wait until October to make money. I have a feeling you're going find a solution, right? -I know more people who buy w-- -Stop. Roses are for any occasion. You can give one to your wife. You can buy some for a dinner party. Instead of wine or chocolate. I've got goods, guys. Oh, you're back in? What do you have? Phones? Sport jerseys? Rosebushes. Or for a birthday, a baptism, a wedding. A hospital patient. For a funeral too! What did she say? Any occasion to say thank you! Roses for your girls! How's that? It's 5pm, you're all totally wasted. If I were you, I would... do something nice so my babe doesn't get pissed. -How much? -20 bucks. The last two and that's it. I brought you more stock. Here's your paycheck. Thank you. Fred, any news from your parents? No. -Hello. -Hello. They're coming along. They're changing. Okay. What's wrong with Fred's parents? They lost custody when he was 14... for negligence. And they never got him back? No. It happens quite often. Some families jump on the opportunity... to get rid of their kids. Hi, guys. SEPTEMBER HARVEST -- SEEDS -- SOWING Fuck, all this for that?! Seriously?! There, just like this. Could we try too? Not with my seeds. I don't have enough. If you want, you can go practice in the fields back there. Go get seeds from natural hybridizations. You'll be able to sow them over there. Get to it. It's starting to rain now. Yeah? So? Okay, thanks, man. Fucking hell. Your parents? My friend called and they answered. They pick up the phone when it's not me. You know, at some point, you got to let it go. You need to move on. You shouldn't smoke with your nose. I don't give a shit about your advice! Yes, we fold the sterile stems. Completely. Exactly. Here are the faded flowers... at three eyes. Here, one, two... That's it. Eve! Oh, boy. Hello, Eve. I was passing through. I brought you a bouquet of my latest creation. It just won an award in Baden-Baden. It was a shame not seeing you there. You know I can't afford the trip anymore. I'd love to help. Gifts are never free. What brings you here? Oh no, nothing. I was wondering if you thought about my proposal. Yes. I'd rather stay independent. It's better to lean on someone stronger than yourself. You mean a man? No, that's not what I meant. It would be a terrible thing to shut down your father's company. I'm fine. Don't worry about me. Thank you. No, wait! Eve... I can make you a good offer, but it has to be now. If you go into liquidation, it'll be cheaper. Be reasonable. I admire you. Because I resist you and you can't complete your collection. I'm just trying to help. Don't push away people who can help you. You'll think it over again? -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Was that Lamarzelle? Did he realize... I mean... Nadège, it's okay. Don't panic. I don't trust him. Walking around like a faggot... ...like a jackal. What? I said jackal. He smells like cigarettes and gum. I didn't notice the gum. What scent? Strawberry. That confirms your sensibility. We're doing the test. It doesn't confirm anything. And here's 200 forced rosebushes! Fred? Can you put music on your phone? Yeah. Samir? Could you get your music device? We're going to try something. Come on go! Today is Sunday Here's my beautiful mother Whites roses... You don't beat around the bush. We need to sell! It's working. When I grow up I'll buy from the merchant All the white roses... 10 euros for the small ones, 15 euros for the big ones. Good, thank you. Small? The big ones are nice too. Get ready to put on "If you go away." We're at your service. Prosperity! Cheers! My father always said, "Never give up on your dream." Thank you. To the Vernet Roses! And to all the employees! Cheers, Nadège. It's good. It has a nice mineral nose. What do you think? Seeing as you'll never let it go, I'll do your damn test! These are extracts of rose perfume with different notes. Tell me what you smell. I smell... Lipton... with lemon. That's it. An English rose "Golden Celebration," with hints of lemon tea. This one. Easy, that's apple. Very good. It's a "Rosa Chinensis" hybrid. An Asian rose. Here? I smell orange and... the boxing gym. What does a gym smell like? Sweat? Yeah, but what else... It smells like gloves, bags. -Leather? -Yeah, leather. Exactly! Orange and leather. Incredible. It's a modern hybrid. A floribunda "Lady of Chenonceaux." And that? There's apricots and... a warm smell... Kind of like spices. It's perfect. Good. There's a hint of myrrh at the end. But you've probably never smelled that before. You need to be trained to go further. For refining. But you are gifted. You really think so? Oh yes, I'm sure. I could introduce you to a perfumer for a training session, huh? Sabrina, come here. We're in a hurry. Hurry up! Sabrina! Come on! Can't you hear me when I'm talking? Mom! What are you doing here? You're all grown up. Why don't you answer the phone? It's been months. I found a job. They say I'm gifted. Really? I'm sorry but we're running late. She has speech therapy. We already missed two sessions. Come by some other time. That would be better. We're over there near the buildings. We have to go. DECEMBER TRANSPLANTATION Here, a handful per foot. Thank you. Oh, that's not good. Cover the roses! Fred! Get the tarp! Give it to me! Catch it. Come on! Hurry! Help! Here, pull. Pull. No, not like that. Pull. Wait. Let's go! It's too late! -Samir! -I'm coming! The glazing saved the nursery. Whew! So... we'll use our insurance. Yes for the greenhouses, but the forced roses are not insured. By the time they grow their foliage... We have nothing to sell for two months. No more company turnaround! No! It's impossible! We will turn it around! This is my mom's jewelry. How much can we get for it? This won't be enough. We need at least 120,000 euros. But... Madame Vernet... I've looked around. I can offer a loan of 95,000 euros. I'm sorry. That's all I can do. I'm almost there! Almost there! What about you, Véra. Do you have any savings? I have only 6,000 euros. My dear Véra! Thank you. It's exactly what we need. It's just enough until it blooms. Okay! Here's a gift for your nose. PERFUME HYBRIDS BLOSSOM NURSERY Madame Vernet! Stop it! Stop! Calm down! -What did you do? -What's going on? The crossing didn't work. It's no good for the contest. It's over. What do you mean? This one is beautiful. Yes but look, it's already stained by disease. There's no resistance. This is crap! The foliage is good here. Look at the flower. It's falling apart. I checked. There's not a single one. How about this one? Yes. Smell it. No fragrance. Nothing. All of this for nothing! All of this for nothing! It's the end of the story. I'm so sorry. I... I'm closing down. Are we getting fired? I can't sell my father's name. I can't do that to him. It's impossible. No. I'm closing, I'm sorry. You're closing for someone who died 15 years ago? What about us? We don't count? With all they've done! You know why I stayed? Your father made me promise to never let you down. He knew you'd end up alone. What are you talking about? It's all right. You're hired with a permanent contract! I'm so happy! We're staying together! You will, not me. I'm not staying. What do you mean? You won't be with us? No, I could never work with Lamarzelle. We're much too different. For him, roses are products. No! Shit! We fought to stay independent. To do things well. And now we get some guy who has a calculator for a brain? No! She's fucking right. You're leaving us. I sold everything! You can't ask me to disown myself. I can' t work with Lamarzelle! I can't! Roses are my life. You got your damn permanent contract. What else do you want? You. Yes. Not sure I like this job without you. Okay. So, what do we do? We cancel everything? We close down? I'm sorry, I agree with you. But I really need this job. I'm 50. I've spent 20 years living in 100 square feet. I'll go sign and come back to say goodbye. You already took my seat. Sorry, I didn't know. No, stay seated. Make yourself at home. So... I've incorporated the patents assignment, like we agreed. Can you photocopy the contracts, please? Thank you. Can we get some coffee? Thank you. Read the contract and we'll move on to the signature. Guys! Come here! Come on! I need you. Come on! Madame Vernet? Madame Vernet! Listen. I have something to say. What is that? A rose from our square. Where we planted our natural hybrids, the ones we did for practice. We checked. They look good. Healthy foliage, shiny, disease-free. Balanced growth. Beautiful flower hold at all stages of flowering. Two-colored. Bright red and pure white. And wavy petals. A powerful scent. A hint of vanilla and lemon at first. Then... like an exotic fruit smell... Pineapple mostly. At the end Nesquik... I mean, chocolate. It has every right to be in Bagatelle. We may have brought you in for nothing, Constantin. When you're ruined, don't come crying. It's up to you to find it a name. We didn't do anything. Don't say that. Even if it's thanks to a bee or luck, you planted it, pricked it. You took care of it until it bloomed. You are its creators. We could call it "Perpetual Countess." Same initials as "Permanent Contract." Cathy! Fred's here. I came to bring you this. We create roses where I work. We try to create new flowers. You know how it's done? You put pollen on a pistil. But that's not... the most important part. It can happen by accident. The most important is taking care of it until it blooms. And these are to say goodbye. Keep in touch, right? Well, yes. Say the word and I'll hop on a train, okay? Paris isn't that far. Samir... Here... I saw you checking it out. Thanks. Take care. You too. -Have a nice trip, kiddo. -Thanks. Take this. You'll open it later. Have a nice trip. You were made for this. You'll make sparks fly. But I felt good here. You might be even better over there. You have to try to know. You're going to make perfume. This may sound superficial, but... it's wonderful! It's beautiful. What is life without beauty? But if you don't like it, don't stay there to please me. We don't necessarily like our talent. It's your life. It's your dream that counts. Okay? And if you feel lost one day, you know the way home. You'll always be welcomed. Come on. Get out of here! Get out! THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS "CAMPANULA": THANK YOU "BLUE PANSY": I'M GONNA MISS YOU. "FORGET-ME-NOT": MEMORIES. Thank you very much. I'm very happy. But I must confess something to you. I'm not the creator of this rose. The true creators are unknown here. They're newcomers in this profession. And we've been working together for... yes, about a year. And I would like to thank, warmly, my lifelong collaborator, Véra, for hiring them. TO MY MOTHER.
