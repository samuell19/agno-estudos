December of 1978. In Ayacucho a radical Maoist group quiety goes into the underground. Their aim: to lay the groundwork for the beginning of an armed struggle. May of 1980. An armed group attacks a rural community of Ayacucho, inhibiting the carrying out of presidential elections. The incident remains almost unnoticed by the newspapers. However, it means the beginning of the bloody regiment of Abimael Guzm?n and his subversive organisation, The Communist Party of Peru Shining Path. In the subsequent years, Shining Path tries to take possession of the country's central mountain chain. Terrorist attacks on rural communities and police stations, "executions" of civil authorities, sabotages and dynamite assaults are becoming a daily routine. Nothing seems to stop the "terrucos". The government imposes emergency rule on the zone. December of 1982. The Armed Forces take political-military control over Ayacucho. The spiral of violence enters a new phase. Shining Path responds to the military offensive with summary proceedings and bloodthirsty executions, with the aim to intimidate the peasants and make them collaborate with the Armed Forces. The "Dirty War" has begun. More than 10.000 deaths, enormous economical losses, thousands of peasant families fleeing from terror to the urban centres, these are until today the results of this "war" which few people had foreseen in 1980. This film is based on events that took place between 1980 and 1983. THE TRAITORS WILL DIE LIKE PIGS THE MOUTH OF THE WOLF I came to Chuspi to change my luck. I wasn't born to remain a subaltern all my life. No way. I wanted to make progress, to make my career. My uncle Roque, who was a captain, told me there was a more secure way to get into military school, by serving for a while in an emergency zone. If one got out in one piece, and had given a good performance, things were fixed. That's why I volunteered to change to Ayacucho. At a first glance, Chuspi seemed neither better nor worse than many other forsaken small villages in the mountains. The same sadness, the same misery, and the same state of neglect that we had seen on our entire route. But after a while one sensed that Chuspi wasn't the same, for they had been here. Were they still in the village? The infantry had cleaned this zone, at least they assured us of that. Regardless, I know that we all thought the same... that they could be here, on this market place, watching those new ones arrive, who they would perhaps kill that very night. Let's go! Let's go! Get a move on! Quickly! Unload! - You can depart. - Understood, my lieutenant. What? Have you still not finished unpacking all this? You have to hurry up! You have to hurry up, sergeant! We still need to dig the ditch. - Yes, my lieutenant! - Let's see! Everyone listen for a moment! I want two men here, at the window, and two men in the courtyard over there, with the machine gun. This is always going to be our defence. - Sergeant. - Yes, Sir. You're going to take care of determining the changes of shift. - Yes, Sir. - Any questions? - Luna. - Lieutenant? Fly the flag from the flagpole. Hey. Hey! Vit?n? Are you awake? Yes. What's the matter? What time is it? Wait. 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock. At this hour we used to be at V?ctor's place, drinking some well-cooled beers. Then getting to pick up chicks. Where would we have gone, Vit?n? I don't know, dancing, I suppose. It's Friday, isn't it? Friday... That reminds me: while those fellows in Lima enjoy their lives, we are here, in this shitty village, freezing, and without seeing a good chick for three months. But it's only for a while, a small sacrifice and that's it. We'll return to Lima as heroes, and go directly to military school. Do you realize, Kike? Becoming a sergeant! Lieutenant, damn! And after that a general. What do you say? No... it's not that easy, Vit?n. And if the terrorists return? Damn! The last thing I need is that they kill me because of your fault. Listen, listen! Hang on! Hang on, buddy! Do I actually oblige you? Did I put a pistol against your head? Let us sleep! Damn! - No, but... - Then don't tell me that nonsense, Kike. How quickly you forget. Don't you remember how it went in Lima? Eh? They almost kicked you out due to lack of discipline. - If I hadn't talked to my uncle Roque... - Enough, stop it. It's no big deal. One has the right to grumble a bit, right? But in the end we are friends, aren't we? Hey, Vit?n. Are we friends or aren't we? What? Are you going to run? One shouldn't neglect the physical aspects. Right? That fellow is crazy. Fuck! Escalante! Quispe! - What happened? - The flag! The flag, damn it! Attention! My lieutenant. Thus you didn't see anything. They put a flag under your very noses and nobody sees anything. They climbed up from behind. We didn't notice, my lieutenant. Ha! You didn't notice? Well then, I'll teach the two of you seriousness, so that you'll notice next time, idiots. They climbed up the wall next to the street, my lieutenant. The footprints clearly indicate that. Yes, it would be a good idea to position a man in that street. - Anyone can enter the post. Nobody covers it. - It's all right, Luna. I'll ask you if I want your advice. Excuse me, my lieutenant, don't you think it would be convenient to start at once? - If something happens... - I know! I know! Let's register the whole number of inhabitants, in groups of two. I want you to check every single household. - Sergeant! - Yes, Sir. You allocate the people to sectors. Anyone suspicious should be brought here, to get interrogated. - Understood? - Understood! Ah, and even if it doesn't seem so, these people already learned how to file a complaint, and I don't want any problems. Here we need to be very cautious. I want neither thefts nor debauchery with respect to the inhabitants. - Is that clear? - Yes, Sir. - Freeze! - What's the matter? Against the wall! Check up, Kike. And? Eh? - Fucking cat! - Let's leave. Come on. Go upstairs! Holy shit! - Come on! - Let go of me! - Quickly! Against the wall! - Leave the kid alone! - Walk! - Let go of him! Listen... leave it there. Don't be a spoilsport. You don't change, do you? Freeze! - Leave my house! You have no right! - Why are you resisting? You're screwed, damn it! - What's this? - I won't tell you anything! Ah! Shit! Listen, check it out. Damn! What's that? Shit! There's the market place... The post! This is an attacking plan! Very good. And the detention protocol? What? Haven't you brought it along? But... But when, my lieutenant? You said that... I said that things should be done as the law demands. And I think you know very well how this should be done. Right? That's right, my lieutenant, but when it comes to people like him, we can't waste time with details. - He is a terrorist. He tried to escape and assaulted us. That doesn't interest me! Here things shouldn't be done as you like, they should be done as the law demands. Leave with the detainee. I'll be there in a short while. Well then, half-breed? Will you now stop the fooling and start talking? Where does that plan come from? Talk at one... talk at two... You're a bit tenacious, aren't you? Let's see who of us is more tenacious. - Do you have a match? - Yes. Light it! Come on, fricking light it! Do you know what that cigarette is for? I will give you a hint: not for smoking. - No, no, no... - Ah! You're already guessing it. Then talk. Where does that plan come from? Enough! Enough, Gallardo! What's the matter, lieutenant? He doesn't understand Spanish, damn! This way we won't get anywhere. Of course he understands! At his house he talked intelligibly. He wants to delude us, that's all. I said that it's enough. Enough! It's over! But that way he'll never talk! Shut up and get out! What's the matter with you, Gallardo? Are you stupid? - Who do you think you are? - It's just that this asshole... Excuse me, lieutenant, but this asshole is making fun of us. Here I'm responsible for anything that happens. Here you do what I tell you! - Why do you defend this terrorist? - We don't have any proof! And the map, lieutenant? What else is there to prove? - That's no proof. - Why not? That's why, lieutenant. We need to get rid of the doubt once and for all. We don't enjoy obtaining information like that, it's a matter of security. Do you think that I don't know the system of rules? It's one thing to interrogate, but another to torture the detainee. This is not a concentration camp. But it's no kindergarten either, lieutenant. This is a liberated zone. Here they killed people! But in the end I'm the commander and you have to obey. Here it's my business what I do. Not just yours, lieutenant! Here we're all together, aren't we? Luna, damn it! You lack respect! - Well, you also lack it. - You're insolent! I'm through with you! This will appear in your letters of reference. I will report this misconduct. And now get back to your room! Today I don't want to see your faces anymore! You asked for me to come, lieutenant? Yes, Moncada. Sit down. I want you to provide a vehicle for tomorrow. - Somebody must have one. - Will you leave tomorrow? Yes, as early as possible. I'm going to San Miguel. - I will hand over the detainee. - But... I don't understand, my lieutenant. It's for the best, Moncada. They should consider what to do with him. He belongs to Shining Path, and it's not beneficial to have him here for a long while. Besides, any moment they may come for him and unfortunately we are not prepared to withstand an attack. But, if you excuse me, my lieutenant, don't you think that's a bit too quick? We're supposed to have 15 days for the interrogation, aren't we? No, Moncada, no. I already did my job. We take the suspect along and consign him. The rest isn't my business. For that we have the Intelligence Service, right? I don't want any problems here. And you are going to consign him yourself? Yes. It won't take me longer than 6 hours. Can I count on you, Moncada? Yes or no? Yes, my lieutenant. Excuse me. Fuck, I can't believe it. How can he consign him? He's scared shitless, that's it. Of course, he has been working at an office desk for 20 years. Can't you see that I was right? They should have send us a man, not this... Chief, are we going to San Miguel? There and back, nothing more. Don't worry, we are going to pay you. Sergeant, make sure that everything remains in order. - Yes, my lieutenant. - Let's go! Listen, don't lie to me, don't try to cheat me. I already told you that I'm man enough to forgive you. Because I love you. Good, Luchito. You did it, brother. This Way?u (Andean music) has already made my balls swell up. - Listen, Sambo, you brought various tapes, right? - Five. I haven't come to dislike Creole music! One never loses track, Sambo! One needs to be from the mountains to like this music. Yes or no, sergeant? Listen, don't ask me, I'm from Julieta. I don't know... I refer to the mountaineers... Of course, sergeant, this one was born a half-brute. One notices, one notices. - Fuck it! Once again this shitty food! - What? Don't you like it, Chong? It's the last ration that remains, so you should be rather thankful. And better get used to the taste, because from tomorrow on everyone will get tasty quinoa and tasty legume. And furthermore everyone should compensate for what he eats. Those who don't work, won't eat! Well, when will I again eat a fine Ceviche? Ceviche? Don't be bad, little Indian boy! Calf's head! He's hairy. Do you think anyone here could prepare us a Ceviche? Listen, Ceviche with what? With lama, legume and potatoes? - Ceviche with lama, and what else? - That joker! And the second dish? Dried lama meat with potatoes! The dessert, the dessert! Icy roots. And that's "La Palizada" (Peruvian valse), right? We are the most well-known kids in this noble and beautiful city. We are the most spoiled kids, because of our agility. When having a night on the town, we are gentlemen, we make a bouquet of flowers, and if there should be a brawl, then we're also unhesistant. Give me a drink, a drink, a drink, I won't let you have that mestiza, I won't even think of it. Reati! Hey, come here! Come here! THAT'S HOW THE MURDEROUS DOGS OF THE VILLAGE DIE What a massacre! It all seems quiet, but we're under forthcoming attack. Will a petition to change posts be considered? Over! Negative, negative. It's impossible to concede the territory. I repeat, it's impossible to concede the territory. Over. In that case we need reinforcement and arms. When will you arrive? Over. I can't determine the date, but measures are being taken. The lieutenant who will be in charge has already been assigned. Something else? Over. Positive. I have an alimentation shortage. 10 days ago the rations have been used up. - I soon need a consignment. Over. - Negative. Use the farming products of that place. I repeat, use the farming products of that place. Call for the help of the population. Is that all, Moncada? Over. Yes... that's all. Over. Don't lose courage, boys. We're with you. The aid agency of Huamanga will soon send medicine and a pile of magazines for leisure activity. Courage! Over and out. Over and out. Come here, buddy, let's see if you can convince her. What's it? - Ask her for a beer, she won't sell me. - He wants to buy it on credit. I already said no. If he wants beer, the he should pay for it! She's as stubborn as a mule. I already told you: As soon as I receive my wage. Will your wage be enough to pay me? Look here. That's all he owes me. What a bill, buddy! Not even a general's wage would be enough. Get out of here, idiot! Don't believe him, Julia. He's a boor. What a consuming habit! Tuna, cookies, beer... Listen, it seems like this store is yours, right? - A bit more and you can sleep here. - What else would I wish for! In fact I only come here to look at her. With every passing day she becomes more beautiful. Don't you think so, Vit?n? Let's see, Julia, look at me. What's the matter with you? Who said that you could talk to me like that? She's still being brash! I tell her that she's beautiful and she gets annoyed. You should thank me and treat me to a beer. You're so smart, right? I won't sell you anything. But if your friend wants to... You invite Vit?n, but not your admirer? All right! All right! What are we going to do? Put it on his bill then. Listen, without kidding, the half-breed isn't bad, right? Look. She got nice feet. Damn! I hadn't even noticed, but looking at them now... Hey! Come on! Everyone to the camp! Hey! Come on! Hurry up! Stand in a column! In a column now! Attention! Sergeant Justo Moncada, my lieutenant. - Lieutenant Iv?n Roca. - Welcome to the garrison of Chuspi! The troops awaits your military review, my lieutenant. Does anyone of you know what's a manatee? Nobody knows? - You, sergeant? - No, lieutenant. The manatee was a mammal living in the river, a bit similar to the seal. It lived near the Atlantic coasts of Central America and Africa. And where does it come from? The amusement park? What did you say? - I'm talking to you, idiot! Do you you have something to say? - No, my lieutenant. - Reply like a man! - No, my lieutenant! - Then shut your mouth! I said that the manatees lived near the Atlantic coasts. And I'm saying "lived", because today there are only a few exemplars left, they hunted them to get their flesh and fat. The manatees went out in flocks to eat grass at the riverbanks, that's where the hunters discovered them. Then they chose one of them, only one of them, and harpooned it. What do you think the others did? - Did they escape? - No. They lamented the hurt fellow and surrounded him in order to help him. They were very loyal, right? But also very dumb, because that way they killed them all. They gave the enemy a cutting edge. That why today they're almost extinguished. Three of our men died due to treason. Shining Path killed them like dogs. I respect the memory of the deceased, but I tell you one thing, the lieutenant Basulto gave the enemy the cutting edge! He went into the enemy lines, and that's why he and the others are dead. Here one is obliged to be cautious. If not for oneself, then for the sake of others! Because they stole the arms of these men, and with these very arms they may attack us any day! They are already dead and there is nothing to be done about it, but we, what are we going to do? Should we lament? Start crying like the manatees? No, men. Definitely not! We're not here to cry for anyone, but to finish with the subversion. And that's exactly what we're going to do! Those you didn't already know this, know it by now. We're at war, and a war isn't won by hiding under your roof. The war is won by attacking! Let's see, sergeant. - Yes, my lieutenant. - How many detainees have you captured? - Well... we interrogated... - Detainees! I said detainees! How many are there? What? You haven't captured anyone? It's that we didn't find anyone, lieutenant. Three men are dead and you're just crawling your balls? There is a mayor, right? Didn't it occur to you to bring him along? Bring him here immediately, I want to talk to him! No, lieutenant, no. Nobody here knew that man. He also didn't have relatives here. Where do the terrorists hide? The terrorists? I don't know, lieutenant. Here in the village we don't know. They say that they stay in the hills, far away. Well, sometimes they come down. - But we don't know anything here. - The attack on Basulto had been prepared here and you know it well. In Chuspi there are Senderists, and friends of Senderists. - You could be one of them. - Me? No, lieutenant. I swear you that I'm not. There were terrorists, as you say, but I don't know anything. I haven't known anything. If I knew, I would tell you. You don't know, but if you knew you would get here immediately to tell me. - That's what you want to tell me? - Yes, lieutenant. Yes. But I don't know anything. I don't know them. I never wanted to get involved. No? Well, you will need to get involved if you want to save your skin, in order to convince me that you're not a terrorist. Yes, lieutenant, yes. And do you know how you're going to convince me? You'll have to demonstrate that you're on my side. Yes, lieutenant. If I should get to know something... if I get wind of something regarding Shining Path, I will tell you, lieutenant. No, mayor, not like that. Not if you get wind of something. You got seven days to. Find something out. I'm going to wait for you here. - This time someone beat you, Vit?n. - What? Look at him. - Hello, my lieutenant. - What are you doing here? I always get up at this hour. I didn't expect to meet you here. You better preserve your energy. In one hour I'm going to make you all run. But running like men. All right, my lieutenant. I got no problem with that. - What did you say your name was? - Luna. Luna? Are you related to Captain Luna? Roque Luna? I'm his nephew. - He's my father's brother. - Roque's nephew! Gosh! I've been a good friend of your uncle, he's a great guy. Yes, very straight. One could say that I'm practically here because of him. - Following in his footsteps? - More or less. I applied to military school, but got rejected. I was drifting around aimlessly, until my uncle Roque convinced me to start as as a corporal. - And apply again? - Yes. - That's why you're here? - Yes, I want to merit. Very good, Luna, but one has to earn merits. I already told you, lieutenant, With me there won't be any problems. No? Because I don't want to have any problems. Come on, Badilla! You sing! The one you know! - We arrive! - We arrive! - To sweep them away! - To sweep them away! - We arrive! - We arrive! - To destroy them! - To destroy them! - Little terrorists! - Little terrorists! - Don't hide! - Let's go, boys! Louder, damn! - So that the terrorists can hear you! - I want to see them! I want to see them! - In the tomb! - In the tomb! - From their bellies! - From their bellies! - I fetch food! - I fetch food! - And I give it! - And I give it! - To my dog! - To my dog! - Little terrorists! - Little terrorists! - I want to see them! - I want to see them! - We arrive! - We arrive! - To sweep them away! - To sweep them away! - We arrive! - We arrive! - To destroy them! - To destroy them! - Little terrorists! - Little terrorists! - Don't hide! - Don't hide! - I want to see them! - I want to see them! - In the tomb! - In the tomb! - From their bellies! - From their bellies! - I fetch food! - I fetch food! - And I give it! - And I give it! - To my dog! - Up! - To my dog! - Down! Up! Down! - Don't hide! - Don't hide! My sergeant! Look! Well? What do you say? Now we're going to eat like real people. Chicken broth with potatoes! Listen, it looks good, right? Yes. Why that? This Roca won't stop, damn. He won't stop pestering, you mean. He already annoyed me with all that running. He thinks he's a soccer coach. That's how it has to be, Kike. We need to be in good shape. - What for? - What the fuck do you think it's for? To fight the enemy. Roque knows what he's doing. That's how it has to be! We can't just lie around and wait for the terrorists to come. We have to go out and sweep them away! You learned your lesson well, Luna. That Roca is his teacher. His guide. Don't you agree, sergeant? - No, I got my own ideas. - That means you don't agree? No, I'm not very convinced that this is the solution. Even God won't change that. But don't you think it's better for us to train? And don't we eat better now? Yes, but we are only 14 men. And 14 men have never won any war. But, sergeant, that's why we have to collaborate with the population. The population? Listen, the population must hate us. Would you collaborate with someone who steals your chickens? Roca gives himself the appearance to know a lot, and with that he can impress some of the people here. But what is he? A major general, a colonel? He's not even a captain! He must have been really dumb not to achieve a higher rank. No, that's not it. Roca didn't ascend, but not for being dumb, I heard some talk about him in Lima. He was promoted a honorary officer and had a bright future ahead of him. Then what happened? He fucked up his letter of reference when he got into a dispute one night, with some asshole at a party. A jealousy affair. They wanted to resolve it with pistols, playing Russian roulette. - Russian roulette? - Yes. The guy blew his brains out. They almost threw Roca out, but his merits saved him. Though he never ascended. Speak, what did you find out? - Last night they were in Chuspi, lieutenant. Ten of them. - What? - Ten terrorists? - Yes. They came through Faustino Sulca's estate. - I was told that they came last night. - Last night? And you report it now? It's because I haven't seen them, lieutenant. - I asked, that's all. - Who is that Faustino? Faustino Sulca. He has an estate at this side of the hill. They took away some of his chickens and two calves. And why didn't he come here to report it? Doesn't he know that he is obliged? It's because he doesn't want anyone to know about last night. The terrorists may come back and ask: "Who is the snitch?" "Who is Yana Uma (black face)?" They kill snitches. Faustino is afraid, lieutenant. The major says that last night there have been terrorists. Is that true? Don't you know that it's a delict to withhold information? No, Sir, they entered by force. I've never seen them before. They entered with covered faces. I swear. - How many were they? - Around ten. They came through that loophole, Sir. And you don't know either that anyone who helps a terrorist is one himself? No, I'm no terrorist, Sir. They threatened me. What was I supposed to do? You now talk like that because you got no other choice. But what if we hadn't come to ask you? They took two of my calves. They stole my chickens. They stole from me. They killed my animals. If I report them, they kill me for being a snitch. No terrorist should eat better than us. You and Chong take care of the part that is our due. Why did you kill my cow? Why did you kill my cow? Such a wretch! What are you looking at? Get a move on, it's for today! Why did you kill my cow? What's happening? What? Don't you know? We're going on patrol. On patrol? Luna, come here. The meat needs to get picked up in one hour, my lieutenant. I'm a piece of shit, right? What are you saying? That I'm a son of a bitch for doing what I did. Yes or no? My lieutenant... You're still a greenhorn, Luna, you haven't understand anything. What...? Do you feel sorry for that Indian because I killed his cow? Do you think I don't? But here one has to leave that kind of sentiments aside. If one doesn't take drastic measures, these people will never collaborate with us. Do you understand? Now I can be sure this Faustino will never again hide anything from us. Yes, of course. Your uncle Roque would have done the same. My lieutenant. The guide is outside, should I let him enter? - No, I'm coming. - Fine. Get prepared. We're going to leave in one hour. Ready? Campaign march in one line. Let's go, Rogelio. Hand it over, Kike. That's what you're good at. Having a drink. Enough, men. Leave something for tomorrow. Gosh, lieutenant, one more turn against the cold. - Do you think this is a camping site? The enemy is close. If he attacks us, it's better to be in good health. Not like that one who already has a tumid face. Or am I wrong? You're never wrong, my lieutenant. What a lieutenant! You should be a colonel, I swear on my mother! I'm sorry, my lieutenant. I didn't want to... Do you want me to shoot, Luna? What are you looking at? Come here. Sit down. What did you think? That I was going to kill myself? I didn't think anything, my lieutenant. Yes, you thought that. I know. But I'm not that crazy. At least for now. Drink. People like to judge what they don't understand. "That one is crazy!", they say. "That one is a piece of shit!". They don't understand anything. How would they understand? They only judge. That's how people are. Bacigalupo didn't mean to offend you, my lieutenant. But there are times when one does what one has to do. Against whomever. At times to forward one's career, at other times for the family, or to save one's own life. It doesn't matter. One does what one has to do if one is a man. That's what the weak people will never understand, Luna. Never. But it's them who make the laws... the weak people. Do you know why my career got fucked up? Do you know what my sin was? Being a man. Having honour. That was my delict. I heard something. What did you hear? Well, that... That years ago you played Russian roulette with some guy. And that... And that his brain splashed in my face. It's true. That's what happened. I didn't want that dispute to go so far, it was him. He brought things to a point where nothing could be fixed anymore. He treated me disrespectfully in front of the others. He told me that I had to show him right there if I had balls or not. A man can't let himself go like that. I did what I had to do. What would you have done? I don't know, my lieutenant. It's easy to hesitate in the cold, but if you have to do something like that one day, that day you're going to know well what you're up to. That is: If you have balls. Because one has to be a real man to put a pistol against one's head and pull the trigger. A real man, damn it! This war is also a game for men, Luna, like the roulette. Here you can also demonstrate what you're worth. That's why I came here. You came here voluntarily? Just like you I asked to be transferred. And do you know what for? To demonstrate all those fags in Lima who is this little lieutenant that hasn't ascended in years. And I swear you they're going to know. Cheers! Damn Puna, fuck! After this Chuspi is going to seem to me like a paradise. There are at least people. At this rate, when you get to Lima it will seem to you like coming to the US. That's right, that's how life is. Who could have imagined that I would dream about an Indian girl? Fuck! What a dream, Vit?n! I'm so crazy about that little one... - You won't imagine how I woke up. - Which one? Julia? That's the thing with having to bear up. Charo would laugh if she knew, but: "In times of war, every hole is a ditch." Listen, I think she also wants to. Did you see how she looked at me when we left? It's just that she plays coyly when it comes to me. I can see that she trust you more. I think that you could help me with this, Vit?n. Help me a little, so that I can... - I'm desperate, brother. Understand me. - Shut up. I'm not good for that, man. What's the matter? That's being unfriendly! How is that? Are we friends or not? Quiet over there! Get down! - Where did you say? - Over there, lieutenant, over there! Two men. Look well! Here! Don't shoot! Lieutenant! - It's me! - What do they say? Don't shoot! Here! It's me! Quispe! - Don't shoot! - Quispe! - Here, lieutenant! - What's it, Quispe? Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Finally I find you! They attacked the post! They attacked us! LONG LIVE THE ARMED STRUGGLE P.C.P. (Communist Party of Peru) ROCA DOG: WE WILL COME BACK FOR YOU. LONG LIVE MARXISM - LENINISM - MAOISM REASONING GONZALO! THAT'S HOW THE SNITCHES DIE. TRAITORS OF THE PEOPLE. LONG LIVE MARXISM - LENINISM - MAOISM REASONING GONZALO! PERUVIAN REPUBLIC COMMISARY - CHUSPI Lieutenant! Lieutenant, luckily Quispe found you. You can't imagine what happened here. He had been too afraid to leave. We asked him to, but he was frightened. He thought that he would be safer here. Lieutenant, we all need to leave this place. We need to leave right now! - They might return and... - Shut up! What exactly did they take? Three FALs... and three boxes of munition. We had to abandon the post, my lieutenant. - We defended ourselves, but there came a moment... How did that happen, sergeant? I don't know how it happened. There were like 15 of them, lieutenant. They shouted while entering, firing their machine guns. We tried to defend ourselves, but it was hopeless, my lieutenant. They had far more firepower, and you had taken almost all the arms with you. For the better, because if not they would have stolen them as well! But what would you have wanted us to do, lieutenant? We resisted for more than two hours! They were far more people! You don't know how it was. You weren't here! Of course I wasn't here! If I had been here, nothing of this would have happened these sons of bitches wouldn't even have gotten close! I left one man with a machine gun at the camp. Where the hell is that man who didn't see anything? Where? This is your fault, Moncada. Only yours! This boy is dead because I left the most inapt one at the post. - But lieutenant! - The most inapt one! Luna! You go to that Faustino's place and bring him over immediately. Chong, go with him. Leave your equipment here. Gallardo, you and Escalante look for the mayor. - Bacigalupo! - Sir. - You and the rest scrape off the paint. - Did you find any clothes? - No. Me neither. If you ask me, that asshole ran away. Open the door, damn it! There's no one. I don't know. Step back. Shit! THAT'S HOW SNITCHES DIE My God! Fuck! These brutes! Murderers! Murderers, fucking bastards! - Fucking bastards! - Calm down, Chino. They want to kill us all, Vit?n! They want to kill us all, just like Polanco! - Fine, Chino, calm down. All right? - They are not going to kill me! These fucking bastards are not going to kill me. They are not going to kill me! - Come out, you fucking terrorists! - Keep quiet! Come out! Damn it! Show your faces! - You are not going to kill me! - Keep quiet! Come here, damn! Keep quiet! Cripes! Quiet. Damned. - Excuse me, my lieutenant, I didn't know that you were... - Just come in. - Thank you. - Can't you sleep? No. - I got up to drink a bit of water. - Help yourself. Thank you. And... Did they already tell you when they will come for Polanco? Tomorrow. Tomorrow afternoon, for sure. And did they say anything else? Anything else? - Like what? - Well, I don't know... if they already considered our petition. We can't continue to stay at this post. And to think that it could have been anyone of us. This time it was Polanco. - But I don't understand how we can be so calm. - Calm? Who is calm here? Not even Roca is calm, it's only appearance. He doesn't care what might happen to us. When he found out that Polanco had died, he looked at the corpse as if he had been nothing but a stranger. It's not like that, Chino. This afternoon he dictated me a letter to Polanco's widow. He told her that he laments him. That doesn't mean anything, he just complies with his duties. - He was already married? I didn't know. - Yes. He was going to have a child. - It was to be born next month, I think. - Yes. Poor Polanco. - He was a good person, cheerful. - And always in good temper. I could have been in his place. I asked him to patrol, but he wouldn't leave. On that occasion he told me about his kid. - Gosh, if I had convinced him! - Damn! - What's it, Kike? Where are you going? - I'm going for a stroll. - I'll soon be back. - Listen! You're crazy, right? Where to? - Listen, Kike... - Let him, Vit?n. He wants to be alone. - What? Are you already closing? - Yes. Should I help you? No, I'm already finished. Step aside, I need to close. Close it, better for me. That way you'll have me for you alone. - I no longer sell. Come back tomorrow! - Tomorrow? No, tomorrow I may suddenly be dead. With your folk one never knows. Please come back tomorrow! I have to close. Then let's close! - Good night! - Good night! Kike! Kike? Kike? Vit?n... - What happened? - No, nothing. Hey, Vit?n! Wait, don't be that way. - Let's talk! Wait! - Don't worry, - I won't tell Roca anything. Happy? - Well... You got upset. Why worry? Hey? Or did you like that half-breed? Is that it? Did you want Julia to be your girl? Listen, damn. I'm talking to you! Look, Vit?n, I don't want to bicker with you. You are my pal, you are like a brother. Why do you tell me that, eh? I already told you that I won't tell Roca anything. - Why the hell should that matter to me? I didn't ask you for anything, I'm talking to you! - You look at me as if I were trash. - What else are you? Fuck, and who do you think you are? You think I did something bad? Fuck! We're all humans, Vit?n. That happens to anyone. Are we going to fight because of that? It's not worth it, brother. We are going to fight because I slept with a half-breed? Those are trifles. Look, let's not argue and make peace again. Ok? How about it, partner? Are we friends or not? No. Come on! Let's go! Faster, faster! Open the door! Now let's all go to the market place! Get them all out! Hurry up! Come on! This way. Hurry up! Faster, faster! Halt! Pay attention! From today on, if you hear this bell, everyone is obliged to appear here. Wherever you may be! Is that clear? Everyone! We all well know that there are terrorist Communist elements in Chuspi. I know that these enemies of the country are right here, on this market place. I know that those who cowardly attacked the post are here, but they won't show their faces! I'm telling them that their days are numbered. Because I came here to exterminate them, and I won't leave before I have finished off every single terrorist! From today on all inhabitants should participate in the antisubversive fight. Anyone who knows a terrorist or notices something suspicious, but doesn't inform us, will be detained! From today on there are no more innocents in Chuspi, there are no more half-tones! You're either with me... or you are against me! And now we're going to pay homage to our only flag, the flag of the motherland! Intone the national hymn! Everyone! We are free! May we always be so! And let the lights be denied before, the lights, the lights of the sun! Before we break the solemn vow which the motherland elevated to the Eternal. - Come on! Sing! Before we break the solemn vow which the motherland elevated to the Eternal. Before we break the solemn vow which the motherland elevated to the Eternal. Come in! - What do you want? - We'd like to talk to you, lieutenant. Yes? We came to file a complaint. She's my niece, Sir. Last night she got molested, lieutenant. She got violated, she was retained by force. That's why we came to complain. Violation... Let the seminary take care of it. No, lieutenant, we want to talk to you. One from here abused her. What do you say? Last night he entered the store. Wearing his uniform, she says. It was him, lieutenant. I know him. He always came to shop. Gallardo... What are these people talking about? Did you listen, Gallardo? - Did you do something? - Me? They are crazy, lieutenant. How would I...? How would that occur to me? It was him, lieutenant. He took advantage of me being alone. It was already late. Last night. I think he was drunk. He smelled of alcohol. How could you believe that, lieutenant? I don't believe it. I don't believe that one of my men should be capable of such a baseness. You should have some proof if you dared to come here. I'm not lying. How would I benefit from lying? He's a lout. He wants to cheat you, lieutenant. Get out. You heard what the lieutenant said. You don't even have a proof. Yes, I do. He saw it. He saw how that one left me behind. Tell him what you have seen. Did you see something, Luna? What should he have seen if nothing happened? An accusation is a very serious thing. If you insist on accusing Gallardo, you can do it, but yes, you need to have a proof. I can't sanction a subaltern just because two people come here that easily, saying he did this or that. If you bring along a proof, I'll be the first to deal with your complaint. Is that clear? - Now please... - What proof do you want? What should we bring here? Seminary. Would you be so kind? That's how they are! They always protect themselves! That's how they are! Damn. These half-breeds! Right, lieutenant? They seem meek, but... It's one thing to play the fool, Gallardo, but a very different thing to be one! We're fucked, buddy. The one who's fucked is me, pal, because I have to replace you. Your turn is over, lucky guy. Drink it. I was already freezing, brother. - See you, Kike. - Buy, buddy. Damn, what a cold! One has to move around. Can you hear that? Seems like there is music over there. - Should we go over? - Let's go. Listen, Kike, should we take part? What do you say? Let's ask for a drink for the antisubversive fight. After all they can't tell us anything. Open up! - Yes, chief? - What's happening here? Nothing, chief. We're having a party. Quietly, nothing else. We're celebrating my daughter's wedding. Yes? Let's see, show me your permit! Permit? No, we don't have any. What a pity! Right, Julio? Without a permit this party can't continue. But... what permit, chief? We don't know anything. You should have talked to the lieutenant. Didn't you listen on the market place? I'm sorry, but the party is over. We need to enter to make an inspection report. Come on, let us in. - What's the matter, Taita? - They say we have to stop the party. - They say we lack a permit. - Permit? What permit? A permit for parties? Since when? From now on! It's an order! Do you understand? Let us in. Permit, permit! They just want to get inside! Our comrade is right. We are not stupid! Go back to where you came from. Take care of the village, that's what you're paid for. We're performing our duty. I'm talking to you benignly. If you don't want trouble, then let us in. We have no reason to let them get in here. - It's our party! - Right. It's our party! They want food! They want our liquor! They want everything! They always steal from us! They want to take everything away from us! Yes, my comrade is right. You are gluttons. Go away! - Get out! Damn! He steals chickens! - Be quiet! Damn! - If not I'm going to detain you all. - You should get detained. - For abuse! - It was him who abused Julia! Be quiet! Damn! Or I'm going to shoot you! Fucking Indians! Damn! They fucked you up, brother. Let's get back to the others. The are screwed. Now they're really screwed! We only came by there, lieutenant. As soon as they saw us, they began to insult us. Just like that. What did they say? They called us "cowardly dogs", "murderers of the people". They are all terrorists, lieutenant. It's them who attacked the post and killed Polanco. Where were they? - In a house, you say? - Yes. - No idea what they were celebrating. - They hurrahed the armed struggle! They shouted: "Long live Comrade Gonzalo!" and "Long live the war of the people!". And what did you do? We wanted to enter, lieutenant. How could we have allowed that? Then they threw a stone at me. We had to run, lieutenant. They almost killed us. Select ten men, Moncada. Quickly! They said that? Are you sure? Of course, sergeant. We are not deaf. Ballsy Indians, damn it! Who do they think they are? You didn't drink, did you? Just one drink. A cold beer. Bacigalupo! Everyone get inside! Search for the guns! Don't move, damn! There are none, my lieutenant. What should we do? Remain in the group, damn it! Let's see, make these three stand up! I swear! We didn't do anything like that! - These are all just lies! - Fucking terrorist! - No, chief! - Speak, damn! - Chief. Chief... I'm Rogelio. The guide. Don't you remember? Yes. You know me, chief. You know who I am. - How can I be a terrorist if I helped you get around? It's all right. Now keep quiet. Will you remind the lieutenant when he calls you? You should tell him! - Nobody listens to us. - Do you want to convince him? Then tell him who threw the stone. Tell him who hurrahed the armed struggle. Tell him and he will release you. Who? No! Nobody did that, these are lies! You attacked Gallardo and Escalante. Or is that also a lie? That's not how it happened. That's not how it was! I swear to God that's not how it was. They first came to get inside, insulting us and threatening us with the gun. What? They wanted to get inside the house by force. You can ask anyone around if you don't believe me. Ask them. - You fucking terrorist! - I swear! It's not true, chief! We haven't done it! We haven't done it! No, that's a lie! That's a lie! - It's a lie! - Who's the terrorist? Speak! Fucking bastard! No, chief! Who's the terrorist? Speak! What do you say, my lieutenant? - It seems to me like... - What's it? It's that... these three all say the same, my lieutenant. - Exactly the same. - And? What if they are telling the truth? And what if Escalante and Gallardo...? You called for me, my lieutenant? Do you recognize any of them? That's one of those who shouted the loudest at the party, my lieutenant. Will you rather believe them than your comrade? But isn't that quite a coincidence, lieutenant? And would've any of them stayed, if it were true what Escalante said? Please, Bacigalupo! Do you now want to tell me that these Indians are Saints? You still don't know them. None of you will leave before you have told me what you know. Did you hear me? And don't tell me you don't know anything, because I'm not an idiot. Who of you are with Shining Path? Who of those outside are terrorists? Talk, damn it! Are you not going to talk, you moron? Who do you think you can spit at, you shitty Indian? Eh? Eh? He didn't do anything! Leave him alone! He hasn't done it! Calm down, my lieutenant! Calm down, my lieutenant! Calm down! Calm down! Look what he has done! Get this trash out of here! And where did you hear that? You're crazy! Answer me, Kike, is it true or not? What I had to say, I already told the lieutenant. I don't have to explain you anything. Why don't you answer me? What happened in that house? Damn, Vit?n! What do you want me to tell you? That Escalante and I screwed them all up for fun? That we are delinquents? Is that what you think about me? I don't know what to think, Kike. You tell me! Think whatever you like, I don't give a shit! But it matters to me, because outside there are thirty detainees. Thirty people who are going to receive war treatment because of what you and Escalante said. - Look, Vit?n... Did you notice there are also women and kids? - No. - Kike, listen... Look, do you know what is going to happen if al of this is a lie? Not only Escalante and you will be fucked, but all of us. - Don't you fucking understand? - Get lost! If you think I'm a liar, then you should go and denounce me. Go to your Roca! Tell him some Indian says that Escalante and me are cynics. Go! Let's see if he'll believe you! Kike... Please, Kike... You can tell me. We are friends, aren't we? We are no longer friends... don't you remember? What happened? They brought him here like that. - Dead? - No, he was still breathing when they brought him over. He suddenly started to vomit, after that he didn't get up again. That can't continue like this, Luna. Do you realize what Roca has done? He already screwed us! Half the population of Chuspi has seen what happened here. Let's go. We have to talk to Roca. Come with me, Vit?n. What's happening here, Moncada? Can't you maintain order? Can I talk to you, my lieutenant? What's it? There's a dead man outside, my lieutenant. - What? - The one you ordered to bring outside. That can't be, Moncada. How can he be dead? If you like, you can come out and look, my lieutenant. The people have already seen it and are screaming. Fucking shit! They scream "murderers", my lieutenant. - Dead? - Yes. And what are we going to do now, my lieutenant? - There's an uproar outside. - And what do you want? That I should just let them get away? No, no. You can't do that, my lieutenant. - Your hand slipped, right? They can screw you up. Shut up, damn it! Impose order outside. You get them out of here! And await my instructions. Yes, lieutenant. I need to think. Sergeant! Tell me, my lieutenant. Strap the corpse on a mule. - Are we going to leave, lieutenant? - Some of us. You stay here. What are you waiting for? Get a move on. Bacigalupo, Luna, Chong. Make the detainees stand up. All of them. Put them in a queue. What are we going to do, Vit?n? What does he want? I don't know, Chino. I don't know. Quiet! Gallardo, Luna, Escalante, Chong, Bacigalupo. Come here. Come on! Come on! Get all back! Quick, Luna! They are going to kill us. They are going to kill us! What have we done? What have we done? Take aim! Fire! What are you punishing us for? Fire, damn it! Stop firing! Luna, come here! I told you to come here! You didn't fire a single shot, Luna! Kill him. Help me! Don't kill me! Help me! What's it? Don't you have the balls? Kill him! Shoot! I told you to shoot! Shoot if you're a man! I don't want to! I won't shoot, I don't want to! Coward! It can't possible, all these people... It can't be possible. We... We didn't want to, sergeant. Fuck! And what is going to happen now? Who is going to explain this barbarism? We won't have to explain anything if they don't to ask us. Listen, are you dumb or do you pretend to be? Do you think that no one will notice what has happened, you asshole? More than thirty people disappear and nobody is going to say anything? - They were all terrorists, sergeant! What do you want? Can we prove it? Do you have any proof? In there we made one of them talk, he confessed everything. And the women and children were also terrorists? And what should we have done with them? What you have done is unspeakable! - It's unspeakable! - We did our duty, sergeant. Go to hell! - No one can oblige you to kill children! - You're not innocent, sergeant. - Remember we're all in this together. - There's no sense in lamenting now. - It has already happened. - Now it's important nobody falls out. No one should fall out! Criminals! Fucking madmen, damn! - Stop talking like that. - This is going to come out. Some day people will know! Then there will be no way to justify this barbarity. Calm down, sergeant! Holy God! How could you do that? That Roca is crazy! Completely crazy! I'm not crazy! This is not a game, this is a war. And it's a dirty war, Moncada. Here we can't sicken at these things. It's them or us. Nothing else! Do you think that Shining Path gave Basulto a fair chance? Or Polanco? We came here with a responsibility, to finish with subversion. That is our duty. Whether you like it or not! To comply with this obligation, one sometimes has to do things against one's own will. But here one can't just start sobbing. Here one can't give in to sentimental nonsense. One has to act, and we acted. We acted for the well of the country, and no one can judge us for that. No lawyer or journalist can accuse us of anything! They don't know what it means to fight the enemy. They don't know what it means to leave everything behind for an obligation. Shut up, you liar! Fucking liar! You shouldn't talk, fairy! - You're a liar and a fag, Roca. - Shut your mouth! Why are you lying to them, fag? Why don't you tell them the truth, eh? Listen...! - Shut up, damn! Shut up! - He made you shoot them to save his position! Roca made you kill because he was scared shitless! Tell them, Roca! Tell them that you killed the detainee! Murderer! You have no right to open your mouth, douchebag! You're not even man enough to have the balls and shoot. And you, Roca? Do you actually have balls? - Fucking bastard! - Show me! Show me if you are a man, Roca! Show me right now if you have balls! You told me how, didn't you? What's the matter, Roca? - Are you afraid? - I'm not afraid! Prove it! Prove it to me and everyone else. You know how, don't you, Roca? Or what? Was that also a lie? Prove it me like a man, with a pistol. I'm not afraid of you, asshole. Open this door. What are you going to do? - What are you going to do, lieutenant? - Open it! Lieutenant... Lieutenant, please, think about it. You're not just anyone, you're the official here. You can't allow this to happen! And you, Vit?n... Have you all gone crazy? Don't be brutes, for fuck's sake. That's not a game! Here someone can die. What? Don't you understand? Damn it, Moncada! Take it! Why him, lieutenant? That's not fair. Happy? Six shots, Roca... whoever's turn it may be. Whoever's turn it may be. - Don't shoot, Vit?n, you're going to kill yourself! - Shut up, damn! Yours, Roca! Stop it! Stop this nonsense! What are you trying to achieve? Both of you have already demonstrated that you have balls. And we know that you're real men! Why continue? What for? - Be quiet, sergeant. Let them. - Let them, sergeant! It's their business. Will you leave things at this, lieutenant? No! Enough already, damn! Let go of me, shit! Have you gone crazy? Do you want them to kill themselves? You shouldn't intervene, sergeant! You shouldn't intervene! Your turn, my lieutenant. I said it's your turn. Haven't you heard me? You already won, Luna, you can't oblige him to shoot. - You're not a murderer! - He is the murderer... and you know this very well, sergeant. - He got no option, you can't oblige him! - I don't oblige anyone. If he isn't man enough, he'll leave it at that. I didn't invent the rules. What's it, Roca? Did your balls shrink? Shoot! Shoot! Shoot if you're a man! Shoot! You shoot! You shoot! I'm not afraid of dying! Kill me! I'm not afraid of you! Kill me, I'm not afraid of you! Kill me! What are you waiting for? Kill me! - Fucking shit! - No, Luna! No! - Kill him, Vit?n! Kill him! You're dead, Roca. Vit?n. Listen, wait! Where are you going? What are you going to do? Damn, Vit?n, I'm talking to you! Where do you think you're going? Do you think you can just walk away as if nothing had happened? Eh? Don't be stupid, Vit?n! You don't have a place to go. We have to settle this right... among us. If we all stick together, then they can't do us anything. Fuck it! You're a jerk! You're a poor jerk! That way you're not getting to Huamanga, idiot. They are going to accuse you of being a deserter. You yourself are ruining your life, Vit?n! Goodbye school! Goodbye career! Goodbye everything! They are going to search for you! Any day they might catch you, wherever you hide! Do you understand me? Vit?n! He was right. Abandoning the post is a delict they sanction with expulsion and imprisonment. So what? I didn't care anymore. Anything was better than staying, anything.
