Black Panther Tell him, you can take it down to eight and we can deliver until the nineteenth. Hello. Just a trim? Yep. Jakob. Man, he's all grown up. - You're bigger than I am now! - Yeah. How was your flight? Was good. - Good? - Easy. That's definitely the amount that Mrs. Brinkmann would get. Yeah, I think so, yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, Mrs. Brinkmann would then stay here. prepare the house for sale and then... Yes... Yeah, Ok. He sounded trustworthy. We're gonna make it. Jakob. Can you already get started in the kitchen? Danger in the alps: Black panther has appeared. Ok. I'll call you as soon as I'm there. Hey. Jakob. I'm gonna leave now. Have a safe trip. Bye. And Jakob... Give a bit of support to Emelie. You really owe her that. And your parents too. Idiot. Hey. - D'you go skating? - Yes. Have to train a lot, right? Nah, just a bit. You already like a Pro? Yes. You think I'm not gonna sign. What? Why would I think that? Because you're neck deep in debt, frustrated and you don't know me anymore. What? What do you mean I don't know you anymore? We've been through this already. you're also getting something, your share. What? I don't need the money. Jakob! Hey you, hello. Well? Yeah, all good, yeah. I cleared out the basement today. No, it was all kinda rusty, I'm afraid. Hey, what I wanted to ask you about Sadelmayer. He doesn't have it? Shit. You wanna call again? But don't let them put you off. No. I wouldn't do that. Wait a second, can I maybe call you tomorrow? Ok. Have a look what was in the papers today. Someone saw a black panther. He's hiding in a residential area. Near here. Already killed two calves. Oh god, it really says that. You see. I told you. Jakob. Jakob, that's you. What? I'm just standing here, drinking tea? You're not going to get it going anyway. You'll see. It's gonna start. And when it starts, we're gonna take a trip. Yeah, sure. What do you think, how long will it take to fall from there if you jump? From up there? 5 seconds. Nah, two at most. You're dead either way if you fall from there. Do we have to go left here? Nah. We're going up there. Look, from here you can see it better. See that field up there? From there you can cross two rope lengths. Then three secured ones up and the last one you can go without. And then, on the one before last, they fell. Mum was here, and dad underneath her. And made his jokes again. He slipped and took her with him. That's not true at all. Why not? How can you be so sure about it? I just figured it out for myself like that. And you've satisfied yourself with that, or what? Yeah. Look. Mum's hiking dress. Nice. Check it out, dad had some cool stuff too. Jakob? Mum told me you don't want to help out in the company during the holidays. L think it would be really good for you to take on a little responsibility. What kind of an idea do you have of dad anyway? It's not like that. Yeah, then you do it. You can do it better anyway. Look! He knew about us. He knew that we slept in one bed together. Are you going CFaZV! Dad always wanted to go up there with me. But we never made it. - Hello. - Hello. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Cheers. Have you ever met anyone special in a bar? Sure. Did you chat them up? No. Did they chat you up? Yeah. Sad, that we never got to know each other. It's strange. You have a cigarette? Nah, sorry, I don't smoke. Whose is this glass of wine? No idea, it was already here. Can I have a sip? Cheers! Cheers! Can I kiss you? Ok. Andreas. Is it not important? Nah, I'll call back. How's the business doing? ls it that bad? Nah. We just have a bit of debt. We're gonna make it though. Do you regret it, that you took over the company? No. - No. - No! If I hadn't done it, it wouldn't be around anymore. Hello, you are Mrs. Brinkmann? Yes. This is Mr. Brinkmann. I've come to visit the house. No. It's actually not possible now. You'd better... call my Your husband? Yes, my husband. That would be best. OK. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Could you please stop! I wanna sleep. Just lie next to me. I was sleeping already Get lost! Stop m Stop! I can't stand it anymore! I just wanna sleep. Stop it! Good Morning. What are you doing? I've been sitting here for a while. I want to go to America together with you. What? Yes. Then we can finally be together. Don't be childish, Jakob. You don't even know what you want. I just don't get you. I don't get it why you're making fun of me. Jakob. You know it won't work that way. Why won't it work? I don't even know why I'm here. Nothing really matters at all here. Ifyou don't sign here, then I'm going to lose the company, you know that? Yeah, but that's your problem. Not mine. Yes. Right, you have nothing to do with it. You just left me there. The plan was that we would leave together. The plan... And you, with your shitty, responsible conscience. had to take over the company. Yes. Yes! Because I can take on responsibility. and I'm not the one who thinks... that she can just do her thing and go out into the world and leave people behind. You're just afraid. Cry me a river! Emilie? Hey. Morning. That's great. It's midday. Are you 0k? Yeah, yeah. Did you listen to the voicemail? Lemaitre wants to buy the house. Really? We have to be out by this afternoon. Where is Jakob? I don't know. You're hardly packed. Hey. Jakob. How are you doing. Where've you been hiding? What are you doing? Jakob. I don't know if you've heard, but there's a new buyer for the house. Lemaitre. I've got the contract here. You want to sign it right now? I'm not signing anything. What? I can't. I want to stay here with you. I want to be with you. Emilie, that's not gonna work. I can't do it anymore. Where do I have to sign? Here. Jakob. Are you leaving now? Are you like that? It can't go on like this. Yes. I'm like that. Please. Please don't, please. Synced by Peterlin
