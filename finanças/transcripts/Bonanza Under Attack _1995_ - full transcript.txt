Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Gentlemen, I have been empowered... to execute the law here as I see fit. Brook no interference. Is that clear? Questions? - What about the Cartwrights? - Damn the Cartwrights. - Let's go. What do you think, Jacob? Shorthanded as we are, we'll be hard pressed to round up all those horses before the bad weather sets in. Ah, we got a chance... if we put in some long days. I don't know about you, Bronc, but I sure am hungry. Hey, Bronc, Jacob. Evening, Josh. Hello, Josh. 5:00 is dinnertime. Half the time nobody shows up. Then when they do show up, they're late. You know how much trouble it is cooking for this bunch, trying to keep things warm? - What is that, Buckshot? - At 5:00, it was meat loaf. Not bad. Not bad? What do you mean "not bad"? I bet you a dollar you can't do as good. Okay. Sure. Okay, it's all yours. Huh. You know, I've been thinking. What do you suggest I do about that offer? Are you asking my advice? Yeah. You're my sister. Who else am I gonna ask? Benj, I don't know. What about your idea of setting up a small law practice here? I know. I guess it's just a question... of what I want to do with my life, Sara. I mean, we are talking about one of the biggest law firms on the east coast. I have to consider it seriously. What about the family? - No! Supper's getting cold. Gets any colder, I'm gonna throw it away. - We're coming, Buckshot. Will you hold this, please? That's pretty good shooting, brother. Not bad. Who won? I did. Isn't A.C. coming to supper? No. I haven't seen him all day. Well, he rode off late this afternoon... to fix that corral down on the south side. Hmm. It's not like A.C. to miss supper. Well, I think A.C. has other things on his mind besides eating. Adam, this is madness. What if my father finds you here? I don't care. I have to see you. Papa's due back any minute now. He just went to make special arrangements for a train force. Our plans have all changed. We're leaving Sunday night. Sunday? Yes. He has a meeting with the president... and the secretary of interior on Friday. We have to leave. Adam, come with us. Please. Oh, please, Adam, come with us. It would be so much fun. Now you and A.C.'s got three days to get those line shacks stocked. I've given orders to the winter line riders to move out... first thing Monday morning. And we're gonna set up base camp at Kane Lake. You boys get your work done, you can meet us there. We've got a thousand head of horses to round up... and deliver to the army by the end of the month. So, we do have our work cut out for us. -I wanna move at first light. -You're not talking about tomorrow, are you, Bronc? - Yes, sir. - Me and Josh are going fishing tomorrow. That's right. We tied a whole bunch of new trout flies. Thought we'd try to coax Old Moe out of that deep hole in the forks. Old Moe will have to wait. We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to get it done. Yes, sir. Bronc. You know, Annie's leaving next week, so... why don't you let me take A.C.'s place? A.C. only has a few more days to spend with Annie. Bronc, I can do it. I can ride as well as any of you. Miss Sara, this is no job for a lady. Come on, Bronc. You're not being fair to A.C. You'll give me your answer then? Promise? Promise. Noon tomorrow, our meadow. It's a thousand years until then. Adam. I don't want you to go. Come on, Bronc. Send somebody else. Let A.C. be with Annie. Are you questioning my orders, Benj? Well, in this case, yes, I am. Don't do it again. You've lived so long, you don't remember anything you've ever felt... about being young and in love? Benj, maybe someday you'll find out just how dumb that question was. Our visitors normally use the front door, Mr. Cartwright. Yes, sir. Perhaps you can explain to me... what you were doing, jumping off the balcony. Well, I came to see Annie, Mr. Stewart. I've asked her to marry me. Ah, I see. Well, times have obviously changed. When I was a boy, we asked the young lady's father for permission first. I'm sor-- I must tell you that Annie's happiness... means everything to me, Adam, as it should to you. I love her very much. She loves you. Therein lies our dilemma. Dilemma? Annie is gifted with a God-given talent... that is meant to be shared with the world. A genius that belongs to the world, not just to you nor to me. Do you understand? I think I do. Let me ask you, Adam. Do you love Annie? Truly, do you love Annie? Yes, sir. Then you must be man enough to let her go. I don't know much about poetry, but what I've heard I've liked. Would you like to hear one of my favorites, Josh? I'd be pleased. Um, this is by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. She wrote this poem for her husband. I like it too. Our mother loved this poem. "How do I love thee, let me count the ways. "I love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach. When feeling out of sight for the ends of being and ideal grace." I wish I could write like that. Mm. That's beautiful. A.C., you're back. Hey. What's wrong? Nothing. Did you see Annie? What did she say? - We've been waiting on you, A.C. - What's wrong? I don't feel much like talkin'. Yeah, maybe I should go talk to him. I don't think so, Benj. You ain't said a thing since we left. I'm sorry. I just got a lot on my mind. Oh, look at this view though. Mm! Isn't it somethin'? The Ponderosa. A thousand square miles... of the most beautiful country in the world to call our home. Dad burn it, A.C. We gotta be the luckiest guys alive. Mm! My, my. - What is it, A.C.? - Saw somebody in the trees over there. I don't see nobody. What'd he look like? A man on a horse. Just seemed to vanish. Maybe it was just shadows. Maybe you saw a ghost. Boo! Sure. I'm just trying to help, cousin. Hyah! Whoa! Whoa! Come on! Well, here we go. We got this one and the shack up at Bear Tooth Pass today. And then, uh, them two tomorrow at Copper Basin. We still gonna have to go like something to make it, A.C. That we'll do. You're going to Europe? Annie wants to get married in Paris. We'll live there so she can study music. You mean you're gonna leave the Ponderosa? Yeah. Hyah! I already picked out the site where I want to build my house, if I ever find a woman that'll have me. Oh, wish you could see it, A.C. Right on a hilltop. Dang, you can see forever. The mountains, lake. Dad burn it! I was hoping that we could... all be a family. Me, you, Benj and Sara-- live out our lives here. Raise our kids. You know what I mean? I don't know, Josh. The Ponderosa just doesn't mean as much to me as it does to you. I guess I just wanna go my own way, be my own man. Well, you go away, and I'm sure as heck gonna miss you. Josh, hate to ask you this, but-- Ask. I need a favor. Anything. Sure you don't mind doing this alone? No, don't worry about it. I'll take care of the lines at Bear Tooth Pass. Meet you at Copper Basin in the morning. All right. I owe you. Get outta here. Have fun. You sure? Get outta here, dad burn it. I'm tired of looking at you. All right. I'll say hi to Annie for you. Dad burn it. If Benj rounds up those strays, we can call it a pretty good day's work, Bronc. Yeah. We'll set up base camp over yonder under them big trees. Right on the point. Uh-huh. Wonder what's happened to Benj. He shoulda been here by now. Oh, you know how he is. Pretty independent in how he does things. Takes his own time. He'll be along. I don't know what I'm doing wrong with these boys, Jacob. There's something missing. Missing? Yeah. Ben Cartwright kept his sons together as a family. They worked together. And by God, they really loved the Ponderosa. Well, different generation, Bronc. Different values, I guess. Uh-oh. Whoa, girl. Whoa, girl. Hold on there. Whoa! What have we got over here? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Put your hands up. Dad burn it. Well, you ain't thinking of leaving us, are ya? Oh, Buckshot, I don't know. I love it here, but Boston is where I spent most of my life. I do miss it. All my friends are there. The only friend I have here is Annie, and next week she'll be gone. She sure turned out to be a pretty thing. Seems like just yesterday you and her was running around with freckles and pigtails. Did you ever hear her play? Once. Me and A.C. went to San Francisco. It was outside on a stage... and a big symphony orchestra behind her. You know, they're saying she's a musical genius. She brought tears to my eyes. Did you know she's gonna play for the president at the White House? For Teddy? President Roosevelt. Yeah, Teddy. Teddy. Penny for your thoughts. I was just thinking about something Josh said this morning. He's right, you know. This is the most beautiful place on Earth. Maybe I am gonna miss it. Just wait till you see our house in Paris. Adam, it's beautiful. It's right on the tip of Villa St. Louis, overlooking the Seine and Notre Dame. And we're gonna be so happy there. Yeah. I'm just afraid you don't know how much I love you. I'm sorry for intrudin'. Truly, I am. But I sorely need your help. Whoa! Whoa! Well? He's about a mile up ahead, sir. Hurt bad. All right, gentlemen, let's put an end to it. Is that really Frank James, the famous outlaw, Jesse James's brother? Yeah. He says he's a friend of Bronc's. Rode with him in the Civil War. Adam, he and his brother are legends. Look, go. I'll take care of him, and I'll see you as soon as I can, okay? Are you sure you'll be all right? Sure. Go. Okay. All right, son. Gimme a hand here, will ya? Yeah, fine. Some Pinkertons bushwhacked me last night just before dark. And they were set up waiting for me when I crossed onto the Ponderosa. They've been chasing after me ever since. Why are they after you? Are you still wanted by the law? No. No, no. After Jesse was killed, I paid my debt. I stood trial three times, acquitted each time. All the charges against me have been dropped. Why are the Pinkertons after you? One man, Charley Siringo, to him it's personal. The law don't count. Now, son, I thank you, but it's best you leave me. You clear on outta here, because they can't be too far behind me. You said that right. There they are. Well, well, well. After all these years, Siringo's finally gonna get his chance to kill me. No, he's not. Not on the Ponderosa. You don't know who you're dealing with, son. Gentlemen, I'm Adam Cartwright Jr. My family owns the Ponderosa. Mr. Ketchum, disarm the prisoner, put him on his horse and be quick about it. Wait. Can't we just talk this over first? Stand aside, young man. - I'm sorry, I can't. - I said stand aside. I heard you the first time, but I'm sorry, I can't. I just can't do that. I'm sorry. I warn you, you're obstructing justice. Justice? What do you mean by justice? Are you gonna shoot him again? No, sir. I'm gonna hang him. - No, you're not. Who's gonna stop us? You? I don't see anybody else, do you? You see, gentlemen, like I said, on this land... those railroad badges of yours, they don't mean much. In fact, I hate to tell you this, they don't mean a damn thing. Legally, you're trespassing. Mr. Cole. Mr. Siringo. Handcuff this insolent little pup. With pleasure, sir. And then teach him a lesson he won't soon forget. Whoa, wait a minute. I got a better idea. Why don't you let me take Frank here to the hospital, and you take your thugs off the Ponderosa. What do you say? Hmm? You move that hand again, I will blow his head off. You realize how much trouble you're getting into, boy? I don't do well when I'm in trouble. Makes me nervous. And when I get nervous, my finger twitches. It's an involuntary reaction. I can't stop it. And in case you're interested, there's a hair trigger on this gun. Just so we don't have any accidents, why don't you tell your playmates... to throw down their weapons, on the ground, now. - You're bluffing. - I wouldn't bet on that, Siringo. But if there's any doubt in your mind, I'm not. All right, gentlemen, do as he says. Throw down your weapons. And the rifles. Don't forget the rifles, gentlemen. Do it. And the automatic, Charley. Fancy. A gift from Mr. Pinkerton for services rendered. I've carried it for more than 20 years. You're the first, beside myself, to put a hand on it. Really? How come? Because I'd kill anyone else who touched it. Well, I guess I should be scared to death then. - Yes, you should. - Is that what you intend to do, Mr. Siringo? Not only kill Frank James but kill me as well? You're gonna be one busy boy. Now ride outta here and keep riding till you're off the Ponderosa. Enjoy the moment, Mr. James, you and your young friend here. You won't get out of here alive. That I promise you. Let's go. Not bad, son. Not bad. Frank James, the outlaw? Yes. He's been shot. He just appeared out of nowhere. We did what we could for his wound, but-- Who shot him? I don't know. Annie, we have to go back up there. Miss Sara, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. We can't leave A.C. alone with a wounded man. He needs help. Yeah, maybe you're right. Besides, it'd make a heck of a good story for my newspaper. Let's go. No. Buckshot, this is news. - I can't just ignore it. - Wanna get your head blown off, Finster? Annie, them fellas that your father saw riding past your place last night, did he tell you what they looked like? Did he say whether they were wearing dusters or suits? Yes, they were. Why? Damn it. Pinkertons. What, the national detective agency? Yes. This is all planned. That's why they're here, to get Frank James. Buckshot, what are you talking about? What is going on? Frank's here because of Bronc. Maybe me. See, we was together-- me and Bronc and Frank and Jesse. We fought out of Texas in the Civil War. You? Well, I-I wasn't always an old man. Track 'em and find 'em. Yes, sir. Frank James, you're a dead man. War was over. We rode out of Texas into Missouri to surrender. Charley Siringo was there with the Union boys. None of them hardly old enough to shave, on either side. I think Jesse was 16. He carried the white flag for us. They heard that Yankee officer give the order, and the Union troops started shooting. And they mowed us down like we was nothing. Saw Jesse take a bullet. I got hit. Still carrying the Yankee lead in my leg. If it wasn't for Bronc, I wouldn't be here. He got me out. I'll tell ya, we were the lucky ones that day. We have to do something to help. Will you come with us? No, Annie, and neither will you. We'll just get in the way and probably get themselves killed worrying about us. Buckshot's right. Thing to do is to get the sheriff. I was surprised to see that old log house was still there. We used to play in it when we were kids. Yep. Your grandfather put it up, solid like a fort. It's the first place the Cartwrights built when they came to the Ponderosa. I remember. We used to call it "the old homestead house." Yeah, that's where it all began, Benj. Yeah, it's a shame it's been let to go to ruin like that. Whoa, son. Whoa, boy. We've got trouble, Bronc. Gimme a hand with him. Frank? Hello, Bronc. Been a while. Yeah, it has. Let's get him off here. Siringo come after us, Jesse and me, from the time we come home from the war, Bronc. He wouldn't let up on us. He was the youngest detective in the agency. And he was bound he was gonna make a name for himself. You know how bad things got during the fighting. Both sides, Union people, and us, we did terrible things. No quarter asked nor given. Women, children killed. Old folks. People's homes burned. Things I don't like to remember. None of us do, Frank. We were bitter. We were guerrilla fighters. We hated the Yankees, and the Yankees hated us. But even after we surrendered, things didn't get any better. Yankees declared us outlaws. Not soldiers from a defeated army but outlaws. So, Siringo hunted us, Jesse and me. He run my blood kin off their farms. He surrounded my mother's house and blew her arm off with a bomb. Killed my nine-year-old brother. I heard. I'm gonna have to cauterize that wound. A.C., grab a hold of him. Gentlemen, thank you just the same. Let's just do it. It's gonna hurt you now. I know. Let's get on with it and not be jawing about it all night. Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh. Done. I didn't catch you enjoying that, did I? Well, that's the most fun I've had today. Yeah. Thanks. The Ponderosa's always been a safe haven for people in trouble. I think A.C. did the right thing. I think he did too. But if we give Frank sanctuary on the Ponderosa, it'll be dangerous for all of us. We'll be putting our life on the line. Can't we go to the law? And what about Sheriff Russ? Out here against Siringo, he hasn't got a chance. Those men with him are professional gunmen, hired killers. They don't give a damn about the law. Now, if we do this thing, we're on our own. Now, I can decide for myself, but I can't decide for you three. - How can you be sure? - 'Cause I know him. We fight fire with fire, Benj, or we forget it. We'll just let him go off alone? They'll hunt him down and kill him. That's exactly what they'll do. Over my dead body. And mine. Jacob? Bronc, you know where I stand. Benj? Yeah, I'm with you. This is the plan. Me and Jacob will take Frank down to the sheriff's office in Virginia City. Then you two can head up to Copper Basin and get Josh. All them Pinkertons running around with their guns, I don't want him up there by himself. Right. You go back to the house and wait for us there. And keep your eyes open. If you run into any of Siringo's gunmen, give 'em a wide berth. - Don't worry. - And good luck. Could be 100 men in these trees. We'd never see them till they were right on us. I don't like it. Think I do? Keep your eyes open and quit bitchin'. Bitchin'? Who's bitchin'? You are. I'm not bitchin'. I'm nervous. When I'm nervous, I tend to talk a lot. - What's that? - What? Over there, something moved. See? You're seeing things. There's nothing there. I'm not seeing things. There's something there. Look. You're right. There's something there. Go see what it is. I'll cover you. You'll cover me? You ever shoot that thing? Of course I've shot it. I'm a good shot. Go on. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Come on. This is the pack of horses Josh had with him, aren't they? - Yeah. - Where's Josh? Look over here. I don't see anything. Looks like Josh met up with two horsemen here. They rode off in that direction. - How can you tell? - See these tracks here and there? See the way they go? You can barely see them. Where'd you learn to do that? Outback, Australia. When I was a kid, an old Aborigine hunter taught me. He could trace a dingo dog for miles across bedrock. Think the Pinkertons got him? Could have been anybody. I thought for years about coming to see you. Ain't many of us left who rode with Captain Quantrill. You know that he was only 28 years old when the Yankees killed him? Yeah. I guess we were all young'uns in them days. I don't look back on those years with too much pleasure, Frank. What were you doing over in California? Visiting my uncle. He's got himself a big ranch there. Paso Robles. I run into a buckaroo friend of yours there. Tom Mix. You remember him? Sure. Last time I saw Tom, he was just a boy. Rode line for us years ago. That's when I first come to the Ponderosa. Hmm. How's he doing? Oh, all right, I guess. Wanted me to throw in with him, making something called "moving pictures." Whole business sounded pretty silly to me. New century, new time, Frank. The life we lived is no longer possible. Mm-mmm. Bronc, ain't no way outta here. Pinkertons got every trail blocked. Can we get out through the canyon? Not in the shape he's in. Can you ride, Frank? Where to? Back to Kane Lake. We'll take shelter the first night in the old Cartwright house. That's our only out. Now, you sure you can ride? I have to, don't I? Yeah. Sure hate getting old, Bronc. Oh, you ain't old. You're wounded. Come on. Okay, boys. Stop right there. Mr. Siringo wants to see you. Well, Mr. Cartwright, we meet again. And you, sir, who are you? My name is Benjamin. Cartwright. That's right. And who are you? I'm Charles Siringo, Chief Detective Pinkerton Agency. I'm a lawyer, Mr. Siringo, and I demand to know why you've put handcuffs on my cousin. Well, sir, I don't, uh, care who you are, what you are, nor do I give a good damn about what you demand. You are here alive on my orders. Now I believe we have some business to discuss. You okay, Josh? Yeah. Yeah, just a mite hungry is all. Let's get down to it, shall we? These are my terms. We'll make a trade. You give me Frank James, and I'll give you Josh Cartwright. - Frank's gone. - We don't know where he is. Gentlemen, it is now... noon exactly. I give you 24 hours. If I don't have Frank James by noon tomorrow, I'll hang young Mr. Cartwright here in his place. Where do you want to make this trade? Here will do. Noon tomorrow then. Mr. Cole, show our guests the door. Oh, one more thing. If you try anything heroic or attempt something foolish, I promise I'll blow his head clean off. Gentlemen. There's Pinkerton guns on every trail. They're swarming all over the mountain, but I think I found a way. Down that canyon. Probably how Bronc and Jacob got out. They didn't get out. They doubled back to Kane Lake. Come on, let's go. They got Josh. Come on, boy, dance! Show us how you can move them feet. Come on, boy, dance. Keep yourself warm. Well, what'd you stop fer? I said, "Dance." That's enough. We was just funnin' with him a little, Mr. Siringo. No harm done. Take the cuffs off of him. Bring him to me. Lucky. Coffee? No, sir. - Whiskey. - I don't drink. Well, I know that you're hungry. How about some food? Please, be my guest. You're sure? Tell me, is it, uh, Josh or Joshua? Josh. And what Cartwright son did you spawn from? Hoss. They called my father "Hoss." You bear a strong resemblance. You're the bastard child. Yes, sir. I had an acquaintance with your grandfather, Ben Cartwright, years ago. It was a brief acquaintance. I can understand why your acquaintance with my grandfather was brief. He was a hardheaded man. Stubborn. It was not a friendly encounter. As I recall, it was a dispute over Bronc Evans. He wanted to kill me. It's a pity he didn't. You know, Josh, years ago, I made up a list... of the men that I thought most evil. I've scratched every name off that list but one. And until I scratch that last singular name off that list, Frank James, well, I just don't feel that my life would have been justified. That's why you're doing all this? It's as simple as that, my young friend. I'm not your friend. Well, anyway, I'm gonna hang Frank James... here tomorrow. My family's not gonna let that happen, Mr. Siringo. Well, then you and your family are all going to die. How you gonna explain that? Simple enough. Frank James, a known and dangerous killer, went berserk. And before I can get to him to save you, he wiped out the entire Cartwright family. You think anybody will believe that? Why, Josh, who would possibly question my word... on what happened here? Ben Cartwright, maybe you picked the wrong man. Siringo killed Bronc's wife? Yep. Didn't know he ever had a wife. He ain't spoke about it since the day it happened. When did it happen? That's a day I'll never forget as long as I live. Him and me was trying to finish building this house... before the baby came that fall. Karina came out of her tent that morning, all dressed to go to town. She kissed Bronc. Said she'd be back before dark. That was the last time we ever saw her alive. How was she killed? The Boyd gang was in town to hit the bank that morning. Siringo and his men were just lying in the wait. Karina was just coming out of the general store across the street. Witnesses said that Siringo reeled around and didn't hesitate, shot her in the back. - What'd Bronc do? - Went plumb crazy. Didn't care about anything. All he wanted to do was find Siringo and kill him. Why didn't he? Your grandfather. Ben liked Bronc. Took him in. Comforted him. Talked to him for days. Made him stop thinking about killing. Then he hired him as his foreman. Gave him a fresh start in life. The other night, you asked him if he remembered ever being young and in love. Benj, he never forgot. Wake Frank. I got a plan. Just before first light, while they're all still asleep, you boys head down to their camp, get Josh and get out fast. - Is that clear? - Yeah. - Let's go. - Now, when you go to get Josh, you're gonna stir up a hornet's nest, so cover your trails, make sure you're not being followed... and get back here. Right. Good luck. That was a while ago. My son's grown now, and I'm real proud of him. He's a good man. I do love my family, Bronc. I never had a family of my own. I always wanted one. But Siringo took that away from me. How's that? He killed my wife, Karina. I'm sorry, Bronc. I haven't mentioned that name aloud in... many years. When Ben Cartwright died... and left me the responsibility of running the Ponderosa, all the kids come back. I says to myself, "Bronc, "this is your family. Be a father to them." And how you doing? Not too good. Not too good. Anything happens to this family, Frank, I don't know what I'll do. Gone. Well, Siringo suckered us. Held us here. Wasted three hours in those woods just looking at this. Yeah, well, he's smart. Yeah, so are we. They're riding horses. Had to leave tracks. Let's go. Hey. Sheriff, look! You wait here. Uh, Sheriff, I'd like to go with you. Whoa! Yeah, you'd better let me go up and check it out by myself. He might not cotton to having a newspaper man around. Welcome, Sheriff. You have no authority on this property. Here's my authority. Holy God! Let's go! Unarmed man! Unarmed man! Siringo. He's-- He's gone too far. No way out. He's got to kill all of you. Stay in the woods and off the trails. They've got men posted everywhere. Right. When you get to the canyon, stay on the west side in the shadows, understand? And if you get through, telegraph the U.S. Marshal in Carson City. You tell him what happened here, okay? Good luck, Finster. We're counting on you. Thanks. I'm gonna need it. Hey! The kid's gone! Huh? What? Wake up! Damn! He's gone! Siringo will skin us alive if he gets away. Let's get him! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! How you doing? They were shooting at him from here. - Where'd they go? - Down there, towards the river. Can't be far behind them. - We're not. There's one. Oh! Hey, that's pretty nifty. How'd you do that? Yeah. Practice. Years of diligent practice. Here, help me off with this boot, will ya? Sure. My wife knitted these socks for me. I had to talk like a Dutch uncle to get her to leave the holes for the toes. She didn't understand the principles of ventilation. Oh! That feels good. Man. I don't know why. It didn't used to feel that good. I guess because I'm older, huh? What's the matter, Josh, you cold? No, no, I'm fine. Really, I'm just hungry as all get-out. Oh, well, here. In the bag, help yourself. Something wrong? What is it? It's runnin' vittles. Bacon pot of pone with bacon, beans. In the old days, we'd cook up a batch any chance we could. Enough to last for days. That way, if you were on the run and you couldn't light a fire, you'd have something to put in your belly. - You eat this? - Sure. It gets cold or soggy or stale. But if ain't gone too ripe, it'll keep a man going. Ain't much of a life, being an outlaw, is it? Oh, it ain't too bad. If you're young, and you don't mind eatin' some dust. Or fryin' in the sun. Or ridin' for days with soaking clothes... when you're ridin' in the rain. Or sleepin' on the cold, hard ground... under a wet blanket. Or if you get sick, pneumonia. Or worse-- toothache. Toothaches are the killers. That's the worst. But if you can put up with that, it ain't a bad life. We best get movin', Josh. Them Pinkerton boys ain't too far away. Well, how you know that? I can hear 'em. I can't hear a thing. You make a damn poor outlaw. Let's go. Here. Put this on. How far is that wine shack? Up at Copper Basin, about four or five miles. Carryin' two of us, this horse won't last too long. Him and me's both gonna need a rest. We'll hole up there for a while. Looks like we lost 'em. They're out there. Come on. We got 'em now. Yeah. You two stay here and keep an eye on 'em. I'll ride and tell Siringo. I got a better idea. Siringo ain't gonna like it. Why not? We get the job done. Get the hell down! How do you know they're dead? That cabin was blowed all to hell, Mr. Siringo. Nobody could've got out of there. Right, fellas? That's right, Mr. Siringo. He's dead, all right. Him and that Cartwright boy. And this here's his horse, Mr. Siringo. Well, you're wrong. Frank James is not dead. He's alive and I can feel it. And we're gonna find him... right now. You all right? You hear 'em? I don't hear anything except those birds. Horses. Yeah, now I hear 'em. What do we do? Can't outrun 'em. Come on. This the boy you're looking for? It sure is. Good to see ya, Josh. Glad to be here, Bronc. Found him under a rock. I wasn't under a rock. I was behind it. Looked to me like you were under it. Dad burn it. You ever consider there's a strong possibility... there's something really wrong with you two? Who, us? Not us. Could use a bath. - You all right, Bronc? - I am now. Thank you. Least we could do. You should have seen it, Josh. Huh? Blood all over the place. Everywhere. And then Jacob, he reached in, he took this big ol' knife right out. It was red hot, right out of the fire. Yeah, yeah. And then he took it and placed it right on his skin. You could hear it smoldering on his skin. Mmm. It made me sick. Make you sick? It was horrible. And that noise. Oh, the noise. That noise that Frank made. Huh? It was-- It was like-- It was like-- No, no, no. It was like-- Yeah, that's it. That's it. Well, I'm just glad he's all right. Hmm? Buckshot, U.S. Marshal's on his way with a posse from Carson City. - They'll be here before noon. - We're to wait here for 'em. When were they to make the exchange-- Frank James for Josh? Noon, why? They won't do it. They'll fight. Annie, I need your horse. It's faster than mine. Take it. Hey, where do you think you're goin'? To join them. A gunfight's no place for a lady. Buckshot, they're my family. Hey, wait. You ain't goin' alone. Sara, tell 'em I'll have dinner ready. 5:00 sharp! Whoa! They're here. Go on. Get goin'. Bronc Evans, you hear me? Yeah, Siringo, I hear ya. It's a trick, Bronc. They're gonna try and flank us. Yeah, I can see that. Benj! You're surrounded, Bronc. Give us Frank James and we'll let you and your people ride out of here alive. You want Frank James, Siringo, you come and get him! Bronc, if I ride outta here, they'll follow me. - Don't even think about it. - Send him out, Bronc, or I'll drag your whole bunch out like they were rabbits. I'm waiting for my answer. You heard it! Fine! Lordy, am I glad to see you! Sara, what are you doin' here? I'm a Cartwright. What are we waitin' fer? Patience, Mr. Ketchum. We'll allow them to spend their ammunition. When Luke and the rest of the boys get back, we'll finish it. Here's your hat. That's my favorite hat! Do you know how long I've had that hat? Isn't that the hat you bought last year in Virginia City? No, before Virginia City. I bought this in New York. Huh. I love this hat. Bronc, you think they'll rush us? I don't know. They should've come at us by now. Must be waitin' for somethin'. Yeah. Kind of gun is that? One of them new ought unloaders. Mean. You can say that again. Very mean. Dad burn it! I ain't hit a thing I aimed at yet. - That's 'cause you're nearsighted. - I ain't nearsighted. It's this gun-- don't shoot straight. Josh, you can't see past the nose on your face, and you know it. Where are those glasses Sara bought you? - Here in my pocket. - Put 'em on. - Nope. - He's just too vain to wear 'em is all. - Make me look like an old schoolteacher. - Put 'em on, Josh. Nope. - Dang it! - You don't put 'em on, you can't see to shoot. And if you can't see to shoot, we're dead. There. You two happy now? He's right, you know. Looks like an old schoolteacher. Can you see? Like an eagle. - Oh-ho-ho! Amazing! That old boy's starting to get on my damn nerves. Yep. Where's Luke and the rest of our boys? Shouldn't they be here by now? Yes. Yes, go on. This all the rifle ammo we got left? Yep. Hmm. I'll get 'im. You all right? You all right? Hmm? You all right, Jacob? Yeah, Bronc. There. That'll stop the bleeding for a while. Thanks. I don't have any more cartridges left, do you? No. Mm-mmm. What'll we do? I don't know. One of 'em just rode in fast! The rest of 'em won't be far behind. U.S. Marshals got Chief Detective Pete Morgan... out of our Chicago office with 'em, Mr. Siringo. They're fixin' to come up here and arrest ya. The rest of the boys, they-- they all lit out. Anybody got any ideas? Well, if we had some rocks, we could stone 'em to death. Stone 'em? Hell, handful of Buckshot's biscuits could do more damage. You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? How many rounds you got, Frank? I got two. I got five. Let's do it. - Siringo! - What do you want, Mr. Evans? He wants to make out his will. Shut up. Hold your fire. We're comin' out. What's goin' on? Bronc, I'll take this to mean you're calling me out. This ain't their fight, Siringo, it's ours. How's that arthritis, Frank? I understand that it's a painful disease, and that sometimes you can hardly bend your finger. Is that true? Let's find out. What are we waitin' for? Yeah, I second that. You stay out of this. You killed my wife, Siringo. You waited a long time for this, Bronc. Get it over with. Don't do it, Bronc. He ain't worth it. You listen to him, Bronc. He's right. He ain't worth it. Mr. Siringo, I'm Captain T.J. Fox, U.S. Marshal. Of course, you know Detective Morgan here. Charley, the agency warned you about doing this. You and your men are under arrest. We'll treat your wounds, then escort you back to Virginia City. This incident... was Mr. Siringo's personal vendetta. You have my apologies, gentlemen. Understood. Thank you. Frank James. You just keep looking over your shoulder. One of these days I'll be there. Don't wait too long. Bronc, you had me worried there. Thought you were gonna kill him. Yeah, I thought I would too. Why didn't ya? 'Cause I got better things to do. Bronc, my father spent his life running away from the Ponderosa. Never had a real home or a family. Until all this happened, I didn't realize how much this place meant to me. Bein' here, bein' a part of this family. Did you say that to Annie? Yeah. She, um, she wants us to live in Paris. But she said if I didn't want to leave the Ponderosa, she would give up everything and stay here with me. Hmm. She loves you, son. I love her. I don't know what to do. You'll do what your heart tells you to do, son. You know, love is a strange, wonderful thing. I had a wife... a very long time ago. And her love was... the greatest thing that ever happened to me. Long as I live, I'll never forget her. She taught me the greatest thing... anyone could ever learn in life, A.C. She said... when you're in love-- I mean, when you're really in love-- you'll do anything. You'll sacrifice anything for their happiness. Oh, there's a few rough spots along the way, but... not very many. I'll be here. I'll wait for you. I love you. I love you. So you got yourself shot again, huh, Frank? I did. I surely did. Builds character. Buckshot, that hurts. Mr. James, we didn't get much of a chance to talk. You might not know this, but I'm a newspaper man. Oh. So you're lookin' for a, a yarn to tell your newspaper readers, Mr. Finster? Yes, sir. Uh-huh. Well, truth be known, there's not much to talk about. Well, no need to be modest, Mr. James. Will you be coming to town tomorrow? I am. I'm gonna see the doc, have these bandages changed. Well, after you seen him, perhaps we can talk. Sure thing. I'll buy you a sarsaparilla. Maybe two. I'd appreciate that. Night, gentlemen. Good night. Sarsaparilla? You're losin' it, Frank. Buckshot, have mercy, will you, please? Come and get it! We're waitin' on ya! I'm on my way, Buckshot. Now that Bronc's here-- without any ceremony, Josh. The family thought you oughta have this. To replace the one you lost. Well, don't you want to try it on, see if it fits? Yeah. Why, sure. Oh, my. Oh-ho. Very stylish. Very nice. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. You're at the dinner table, son. Oh, yes, sir. Oh, my. It's nice to have the family back together again, isn't it? - Right. Oh, yes. Ain't it the truth. Dad burn it.
