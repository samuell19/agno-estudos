CORVETTE IN ACTION Tanguy MASSANGE 7/02/2023 It's the story of a corvette, a small boat, a combat boat. And officers and men of the Royal Canadian Navy, who made the corvette name synonymous with resistance and sacrifice. Among the submarines of the North Atlantic route. Without the active assistance of the men and ships of the Royal Canadian Navy this story could not have been told. 1943... A destroyer with convoy returning to Canadian waters. - The lightship is not responding. - Maintain communication. Hello, Lt. We report to the fireboat. We will arrive around noon. Take a deep breath, it smells like Canada. It smells good. A 28-day leave is not nothing! I receive an order, but I can't get my boat. - But they gave you another boat. - I like this one. They all say that. In six months, aboard another corvette, you will say: it is the best of the Canadian fleet. You should ask for a destroyer. Can't get enough of these ducks? The lightship responds. Take this message: "The Yukon with convoy 63 is accompanied by 37 ships and survivors of the two Norwegian and Canadian freighters. Ambulance requested on arrival. We will cross the pass at 12 o'clock. "Ambulance requested on arrival." - Shall we have a drink? - Good idea. Have the butler bring a drink to my cabin. Helmsman, call the captain's butler. Butler, on the bridge! Captain Stewart is wanted on deck. At least when you're torpedoed you get a new uniform. I no longer risk jumping with a ship. From now on, I stay on the ground. - You said that before the war. - This time it's true. How will you do? I will say to the company adjutant: "It's not that I don't like the sea, it's my ulcer." He will answer: "O'Meara, for your loyal service on the corvettes". we'll untie you ashore Well housed, a few extra dollars a day, sitting behind a desk in immaculate attire. - You see that? - No I can not. They're not short of recruits. They don't wait for me. T'as raison. Besides, Stooky. I heard the major mentioning you to Mr. Rawlins. He will reform you. Re-form? - Reform? - You're getting old. A corvette is too hard for you. He said that? The old man said that? - Yes. - He wouldn't go to sea without me. I'll be on his next ship. I'll be on the last boat, and you can't leave me behind. That is what he said. We arrive. Are all the men okay? - Yes sir. - GOOD. We'll be ashore with the first hawsers. (Large rope used for towing or mooring) - Thank you sir. - Very good sir. The best brand we have! Glad he got away with it. - Glad to save... - Listen, gentlemen. What they said makes no sense to me. I am a baby. I barely have a wrinkle. They have your number, Stooky. Come on guys, let's go on deck. What's up with you, Cricket? - I was thinking about Shakespeare. - He had fleas. Sure, he had fleas, but he was the prettiest puppy in the fleet. He was swimming towards the raft when they strafed him. The Nazis will pay me for it. - You're right. - We will know. - Everyone on the bridge. - My favorite sentence. - I support corvettes as well as you do. - Before Yes. Who lifted you onto the raft? I saved almost all of you, so don't talk to me about "before". - Who was it? -Tommy Roberts. - Check with the warrant officer for your leave. - At your service. - Do you know what you're going to do with it? - Yes sir. - And you, old man? If I was a drinker, I'd take a good binge. Good thing you don't drink... It's curious, there are errors on the sheets. They made me ten years older. It's a giddiness a bit awkward. Ages me prematurely, doesn't it? - Well... - Excuse me, sir. I would like to take care of the wounded. - Alright. I'll be in the Admiral's office. - Yes sir. - Stay out of trouble, guys. - Yes sir. - Well, here we are. - A man wouldn't do that! - I'm sure. I'll be on his next ship. No way! He belongs to someone. But he looks very lonely. - Officers. - Glad to see you, sir. I will notify the Admiral. - Hello Tom. - Glad you're home. You've been gone for a while! - Lieutenant MacClain is here, sir. - That's good news, officer. - Good morning. MacClain. Come on, come in. - Thank you sir. Take a chair and make yourself comfortable. Take a cigarette. We have received your signal. What happened to you? We were in a ten foot storm, we caught a torpedo that was targeting the tanker on the port side. We were lucky. - Where have you been? - Best Bridge, minutes from downtown. - Submarines? - A tap. - Have you had any? - During the first attack, we forced one out. I sent men on board, they jumped with it. - I didn't know. - There were no traces. And now? We hit another one with our last grenades. Then the Yukon finished the job. The Boches did not come to the surface. - Well done. - I have a good team. I know it, MacClain. I checked the list of men today. Only six of them had been at sea before. The others came from the Ontario plains and regions of Quebec. Where is your first mate from? - From Regina. A pharmacist. - And your signs? One was studying law in Vancouver. The other was from here and out of high school. They honored their name and yours. Do you plan to stay ashore? - I want another ship. - I thought so. - We'll talk about that later. - I wish it was now, sir. And your leave? I would like a ship as soon as possible. Why so fast? - It's my job. - No. There is something else. Yes sir. The submarine torpedoed us and then surfaced. We pulled out the starboard boat full of men. The German submarine strafed them all. I watched helplessly. We will find him. He had an iron cross on his kiosk. We will recognize it. Approach. I have no mission for you, but here are six corvettes ready to be launched. You had one of the first, these are superior. Take a little rest, then come back and choose one. I would like to do it today. Yes sir. - Inform me of your choice. - Thank you sir. MacClain? You did very well. Thanks again. Attention. What are you waiting for? - Have you seen the warrant officer? - Yes sir. But... - Excuse me sir. - What is it, Bailey? - Were you assigned a ship? - Yes. Are we going with you? And how! - That's what we wanted to hear. - Me too, sir? - You all. - It's good to hear that. Sir. Great, sir. THANKS. You lied to me, filthy vermin of the seas! Make me think I was reformed! When I'm done with you you'll look like a pickled herring. Stop that. I'm tired. - What are we painting here? - They weren't baptized. I ask you what it is like gear?. It's not a destroyer nor an aircraft carrier. - But it's a corvette. - To me, it doesn't mean anything. - When you arrived? - Yesterday. They put a cannon on it? Oh my God. 40,000 men build corvettes in Canada. One completed every four days. And you ask me if they put cannons on corvettes? They may not be very pretty, but they have guts. Who is risking it? Guys who don't have life insurance. Are there many of these sea locusts? The navy is discreet. Then I do not know. But we've been building them since the beginning of the war. And you better keep going. - Who was it? Is it the foreman? - I don't know, but I wouldn't. Where can I find Mrs. Cartwright? I think you'll find her in the kitchen Merci. Excuse me. I would like to speak to Madam. Cartwright. Joyce, someone wants to see you. My name is MacClain. - Lieutenant Commander MacClain? - Yes. I think we better talk outside. You came to talk about my brother, right? Oui - When did you get back, Mr. MacClain? - Today, a few hours ago. - How many came back? - 12. 12 out of 65. GOOD... It's better than nothing. You are a lucky guy, Mr. MacClain. It's always a matter of luck. In a way, I always thought my brother would be one of the lucky ones. I'm sorry. How did it happen? The boilers were hit. On a corvette, it's fatal. J'imagine. Where was Dick when it happened? We lost it before it was torpedoed. How so? We brought a U-boat to the surface. I sent men aboard and they jumped with the U-boat. This had been hidden from me. - What was Dick doing in the submarine? - I sent him there. For what? We had to catch the sub getting scuttled. And... is that how he died? - Without a chance... - There was. On a sunken submarine? Why Dick? Somebody had to go. He was available. Available? A boy must die because he is available! You sent someone who knew nothing about it, He had never been to sea. - He was one of my officers. - He was just a kid. When he first joined your ship , he was talking only about you, how hard you were, how unhappy he was. You were never happy. He had to learn. He paid a terrible price for your teachings. Mr MacClain? Why did you come to see me? Will you see all the families of the men you lost? - No. - Is this a special case? Was there something that bothered you that made you come here? I'm really sorry, miss. Cartwright. Did you know he was going to be killed? And that you shouldn't send it? No, it's not for that. Why not a more experienced officer? - Where were they? - Only one came back with me. He was 22 and the others were dead. I came to give you what belonged to your brother. He was an excellent officer. I sent him because I trusted him and he wanted to leave. Good bye, young lady. Cartwright. JOYCE 'S COCK - Hello, Captain. How do you find that? - Alright. The forecastle isn't too long? It will keep the tubes dry. She will be ready soon. Excellent. Mr MacClain? I was told at the office that I would find you here. - I came to apologize. - There 's no reason for that. - I came to apologize. - You're welcome. I was rude to you. I was angry. One of those futile gifts You came to bring me this memory of Dick. to which we are attached. It wasn't easy, and I didn't help you. That's not true, lady. Cartwright. Thanks for telling me that. Can I... sit with you for a moment? But certainly. This is your new ship, isn't it? I saw you staring at it. I'm from Nova Scotia. I have always seen men looking at ships. It is easy to guess who they like and what they want. You can't wait to go - at sea, because it is yours. - You know your stuff. In Nova Scotia, we know about boats, and fish. The best in the world. Have you tried Frazier's salmon? Non. In other words I... I want to tell you that I was wrong last night. I know where to find trout like that. But you have to fight to catch them. Thank you so much. When will it be ready? Soon I hope. You are impatient, aren't you? Well...I like escorting convoys. For what? I guess it's because ... Well. When we hand over the cargoes to the English on the other side, it always affects me. I don't know why, but... I like it. Thank you Mr MacClain. I would love to come back. It's almost time to eat. We could stop in town. Fish from Nova Scotia? At least we could discuss it. There is a stone in my shoe. - We've come a long way. - I did not notice. Me neither. King's College is a lovely place, isn't it? - You come here often? - As far as I can. The callback is coming soon. - Paul? - Hello Joyce. Paul, this is Lieutenant Commander MacClain. - Ho are you doing? - I was looking forward to meeting you. It is my brother. I know you told him about Dick. - We appreciate that, sir. - I didn't know you had two brothers. - You follow a good example. - Thank you sir. - Where are you? - I finished my maneuvers course. When are you finishing? One more month of artillery and it's over. The reminder! Delighted. - See you later, Joyce. - See you later, Paul. Watch out, division. Coaching. They are so elegant. So young. You hid this brother from me. Non. I know. Thanks for coming to see me. You didn't have to apologize. I think so even more now. To the right. Rest. Left, walk! It's booze, this beer. - Well... - I know, he seems all alone. - Hey Stoky. - Pushes you. - Where were you? - On site. The commander goes there every day. Speaking of ships. When will it be ready? We wet his buttocks tomorrow! Stooky, there's something we don't understand. We were told there are six corvettes under construction. - Yes. - He picked one. Yes, the 225 is a very pretty lady. Why did he choose this one? All the same? - It's ridiculous. - For what? - You do not understand. - Understand what? A ship has it or not. What? The old man and I saw it right away. We gauged them from start to finish. Then we sat down, and we have seen it: number 225. We looked at each other and said, "That's the one!" - I still do not understand. - Of course! There are things that only a true sailor can see on a boat. How to say... let's say... It's psychic. What does it mean? - How can I put this... - Well Stooky. The old man and you, maybe you can look at six hulls and say, "That's the one." But to me, a boat is just a boat that goes on water. Evans, a ship has a soul. My eye! A ship only has character and... So go home. So take your 28 days off that you talk about so much. - Bailey, could you... - I want to leave one last time. - What's the matter? - I want this mug. - There are three more. It's the same. - But I want this one. - For what? - You can not understand. Only true beer drinkers can recognize a mug. - It's psychic. That's right. Psychic. Isn't it something prescribed by the doctor? Non, Cricket! ...for he commanded the storm to blow, and raised the waves. Then the storm had to calm down , and the waves subside. He who is wise and respects these rules will be able to understand the love and kindness of the Lord. Guide them in peace to the havens where they will go. with your mercy, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. I baptize you "Donnacona". May God be with you and with your crew. - Madam. Guillaume. Well done, great launch. - THANKS. - Good luck, MacClain. - Thank you sir. SHIPYARD WORKING AREA CONTRACT 228 - K225 HMCS DONNACONA SHIPYARD WORKING AREA - JULY 1943 NAVAL MESSAGE - FROM THE GENERAL TO THE HMCS DONNACONA COMMISSION THE DONNACONA WILL DEPARTURE AT 1300z/10. 15 ensigns leave for the west coast. - Give me the list. - Yes sir. Hi Mac. Ready to sail? - All that's missing is the crew. - Here it is. The men have their equipment. The office has been notified. I know what you think. It's mostly bruises, but you've had them before. You will also have elders. Most have never seen salt water. I have no more experienced men to offer you. As for the officers, Rawlins leaves with you. And First Lieutenant Bill Gardner knows all about the Atlantic lines. And your ensign will be Cartwright. I believe he's the brother of the guy who was with you. Oui. - GOOD. Good luck Mac. - THANKS. Hello Blake? Tell Barracks that the men from the Donnacona should be ready to board tomorrow morning. Tell the company officer they must be impeccable. An Admiral's inspection is nothing compared to it. Rogers, Seaman Third Class. - Already served on a corvette? - No sir. I am a new recruit. We expect a lot from you. On a corvette, service is tough. Here is your card. The orders are at the crew's quarters. Yes sir. All right, Jimmy Number 1. A former hockey champion. - What's his name? - The naval lieutenant is still called Number 1. - Never been to sea? - No. I have lived all my life in Saskatchewan. - A hick, right? - Must believe. What is the little house on the catwalk? Asdic. The strategic position of the ship. It's for submarines. A trick allows them to be detected and tracked. Salut Smith. How come you board? You wanted to stay down. I was offered it, but I got married. - Congratulation. - Oh no! - Then my condolences. - Yes sir. You haven't forgotten the rules of the Canadian Navy or the duties of a sailor? - I hope so. - Very well, Mr. Lawyer of the Seas, but if you miss to the regulations, watch out. - Go put your bags away. - Thank you sir. - Smith... - Yes sir. Cut your hair, by the beard! Yes sir. Just old friends. - How are you, Cricket? - So-so. You've put on some belly fat since the last time. - What race? - I don't know, sir. Let's see. He is very small. Nothing to talk about. He was all alone, he needed a home. But where do you find them? - He is cute. - His name is Milton, sir. Well, Milton, I agree, if the crew agrees. Thank you sir. Come on, Milton. I'll show you the ship. Here we are. Cook, can you give me a haircut? I take my scissors and I arrive. - Are we going to live here? - Yes, do you like it? It's small, but I've been waiting for this for a long time. Me too. Take this. Not too short, Cook. - It's not the cook! - Yes, it's him. Non. I regret having taken you. We're going to be skin and bones if this skeleton feeds us. Don't worry, I'll find you a cozy corner. - Where did you pick that up? - It's Milton. Milton, the boys. Hi Milton. - It is the last. - No sir. We miss them. Unfortunately, we were stuck with Walsh and Jones. We fight against Hitler and Walsh, against Jones. Wait a moment. Not so fast. - Who goes first? -Walsh, Jones. Climb on board! - First class driver, Jones. - And Stoker First Class, Jones. We were aware. You fought on half of the fleet... We've only been on six ships. - Sept! - Six! The other was at the quay, - It does not count. - No more fights, okay? - Oh no! It's finish. - Yes sir. It's finish. - Is it really over? - Yes sir. And what's on your eye, Walsh? - That's old, sir. -It was from yesterday. I repeat: the ship's boiler is not a ring. - Yes sir. - Yes sir. All officers must go to the commander. - THANKS. Carry on, Cox. - Yes sir. - Help yourself, Rollings. - Thank you sir. I love housewarmings. I can't wait to take it offshore. Have a drink, Number 1. Thank you sir. The crew is complete. - What do you think? - It smells of wheat grass. Salt water is an excellent deodorant. They'll get used to it. - What is the program? - Escort on the high seas. My wife has returned to Montreal. She is single again . We will come back. - What do you think, Rawlins? - Very good sir. I like the wide. Me too. Oui. Your fellow officers... Gardner. - Hi, Cartwright. - Good morning sir. Your fellow officer, Mr. Paul Cartwright. -Gardner. - Nice to meet you, sir. - Head look. - Ho are you doing? -Rawlins. - Hello. - Have a drink, Cartwright. - Thank you sir. - From Dick Cartwright's family? - He was my brother. - Welcome. - Do any of you like speeches? - No, not at all, sir. - I hate. Especially when I'm at an officers meeting. We'll get over it. - What's your specialty, Cartwright? - Anti-submarine defense. - So you'll be on asdic. - Thank you sir. No problem. Don't like sherry? - Yes sir. - Drink. We won't have much time to drink from now on. Stop! Only ten minutes on the boat and they fight again. What is going on? I wasn't doing anything special when... - Stand up! - Are you kidding? Drop it, jerk! Who started? - Not me! - It's him! - You lie. - Who are you talking to... Want to be transferred to separate ships? - No, not that, boss! - Another fight and you go to Number 1. Yes sir. Remember what I told you. Walsh, get changed and go downstairs. - You heard what was said, didn't you? - Yes yes. No more fighting. Imagine we're not on the same ship... It would be a good reason to share a beautiful friendship. Here is. Merci. GOOD. In the bright lights of the city. What are the evenings like? I forgot. It has been such a long time. There's a refrain on this ship: Everyone down, except Cartwright! - You work a lot. - I'm a duty officer. - What is it, Paul? - I don't know, Joyce. - You don't like being on duty? - No. It's not that. I learn a lot. But... He is never satisfied with me. - You're talking about Mr. MacClain, aren't you? - Yes. Tell me. Every day, we take for our rank. We did a test trip, and he set us all on fire. Especially me and the blues from the crew's quarters. We are supposed to already know everything! Even when we do the right thing, he groans. - I guess it's not easy, is it? - It could be worse. He thinks he wins alone the Battle of the Atlantic. Mac, come to dinner on the ship tomorrow. This floating powder keg? Certainly. We serve the Navy's greasy mesh ! - GOOD. Good night. - Good night. - What are you doing? - I don't know. We were told to put that down. It's an ammo hatch! Marin. - Yes sir. - Where's the quartermaster? - He was there. - Where's the duty officer? - I think he's underwater. - Show them how to secure these bottles. Come on, get them out of that hatch. - Good day sir. - Hello Mac. - Hello Joyce. - Kept you company with Paul. - A drink, sir? - Thanks, I'll help myself. By the way, we won't get far by attacking the Germans with soda. - Pardon? - Bring civilians on board and put... ...bottles and magazines in your hands. There was no officer on deck. - Are you the officer of the day? - Yes sir. Yes, for three days. I don't think that's the question, sir. Cartwright. - Very good sir. I'm wrong again! - I don't like your attitude. What are you expecting from me, I provide my share of work! That's for me to judge. Nothing satisfies you. Go back to your cabin, stay there until further notice. Very good sir. Good night Joyce. I think I better go now. I regret that you were there. It's serious, what he just did? It could be if it went further. I guess I should have realized that. No one can shake your beliefs, can they? This ship is under my command. That's all. And it's not easy for you to take Paul, is it? Everything depends on you. You will leave this ship with a tragic look on your face. or you say to yourself: "A young officer was put in his place by his commanding officer." - He deserved it. - Everything will be alright. - Good choice. - I'll see you tomorrow evening in the canteen. Mac? I know something else: I know that a ship is nothing without the men who sail it. And when you're gone. I know you and Paul will be back. Good night. Helmsman. Tell Mr. Cartwright to report to my cabin. Yes sir. - Yes. - The commander asks you, - ... in his cabin, sir. - Alright. Come in. I owe you an apology, sir. Cartwright, when you arrived, I saved you a speech. I was about to make you one now, but I prefer to make you think. There are 65 men aboard this ship. Their life is at all times the responsibility of the officers. Nothing else matters. Yes sir. - Do your rounds. - Yes sir. CONVOY CONFERENCE FOR OFFICERS COMMANDING UNIT 3-B Bonjour. - Hello, Captain. Among us again? Are you in Aukland City? Yeah, remember that attack in Iceland? - A little! - What show! - Hi, MacClain, how are you? - Well and you? MacClain, what are you doing here, young man? - Captain Smith, how are you? - I'm doing well. Yes, I am sailing on an Etoile d'Egypte tanker. - What are you doing? - I have a corvette. - You will protect me! - Yes. Don't weave past my bow. Remember when I was three grades below me? You were awful. I've only had one worse than you. I went overboard on the south side towards Jamaica. If I had been that bad, I wouldn't be the best source for your cigarettes. You stole me from Halifax to Hong Kong. I was a little distracted, question cigarettes. - Hi MacClain. - Good morning, John. Nice to see you. - Do you have the orders? - Yes sir. - Captain. - Glad to have you here. - Thank you so much. - Sit down, please. I have a small thing to say about the presentation. Many of you have sailed with Commodore Ramsey before. And I think everybody was part of a convoy in that port. Sealed orders have been given to you and they can speak for themselves. Here you will find your position in the convoy. You absolutely must keep it. Corvettes are there to protect your maneuvers. If you lose your position, corvettes will not leave the convoy for a straggler. In case of fog, tighten up as much as possible. The commodore's ship will send flag signals. At night, only urgent counterorders will be given. I wish you a pleasant and safe crossing. Sir.. Are you all sure of your shipments? Let me tell you this, Last month, two merchant ships sank, because... ...for poor lashing. Negligence or willful action. I would go for the latter. At sea, it is difficult to parry enemy actions, but we can avoid leaving defeated and therefore parry to sabotage. Thoroughly inspect your freighters. Let's see where we're going, and how... The escort leaves at 0900 tomorrow as an anti-submarine scout. We follow them by forming the convoy leaving the port. There will be six corvettes in the escort, ..under the command of Roland, the senior officer leading the escort. There will be six file lines of five ships. Here is our road and here is the Ethel. Our positions have female names. Ethel is a bit risky. The Germans revolve around... Let's drop this lady and move on. I prefer that, you looked gray. From there, we will hold our course for 24 hours. If we manage to maintain a speed of nine knots, we got off the hook for a while A propos... I don't want to see any lights after dark. Watch the galley hatches. They tend to open at night. Now we rule to the north, heading 3-5-2, to our new position, Mary. Then, to the east, for 24 hours. to reach a named Marguerite. Sorry to let you down, but it's urgent. I come back tomorrow morning. We're leaving tomorrow morning, Joyce. - Oh no! - Those are the orders. I didn't think it would turn out like this. I have to go Mac. I would like to stay, but they need us. - Ready to go. - Goodbye Paul. The ships of convoy 94 must weigh anchor, and advance in order at the times indicated. - Hello, did you sleep at home? - Yes. Commander let me in. But I haven't seen my sister, she was on duty. - I knew it. We manage to ensure that the new ones are on duty. Finally, we try. You don't blame us? No. We are about to leave. Tell me, how is it going? Not too bad, if you have a sense of humor. You won't see anything once you take the first dark corner. We are about to leave. A final warning. Put away everything that is fragile, it will stir a lot. We will go full speed when we set sail. And for God's sake. Don't open that porthole, if it's too heavy, the Atlantic would flood in. - I look forward to seeing you on deck, sir. - THANKS. I'll meet you upstairs. Cast off. Prepare to maneuver. Prepare the machines. Drop ahead! Untie the ropes! Drop behind! Before dropped! Back dropped! Forward, slow! Starboard, everything! Forward, slow! Starboard, everything! Turn full throttle, we've got a long way to go. Well, you won't see Canada for a long time. Take a deep breath, Milton. It is a beautiful country. It's when we leave that we appreciate things. You're a lucky guy, with your 28 days off. - Hey, when do I have to leave? - In 1952... We leave the harbour. I'm taking you down, Milton. First ship. 1-0-3-0. British. The Star of Egypt. Ship number two. UNITED STATES, Benjamin Franklin. - Hello, Anderson. - Good morning sir. - Good morning. - Hi, Jack. No thanks. Convoy 94 leaves port. - What's your total cargo, Anderson? - 400,000 tons, Ralph. Especially planes and tanks. There is also a lot of oil. How many convoys left in all? I do not know anymore. I still love watching them go. I remember the first convoy. There have been many new flags since. What sounds on U-boats? Rather bad. But our little guys are there. You have a thing for corvettes. Well, I spent many years at sea. But nothing beats a crossing on a corvette. Look at them. As I said before. I love this view. Rum tour! Rum tour! - Here comes the bagpiper! - It's good, tradition! According to the regulations, the rum is ten minutes late. Your rules! Even late, it's rum! I thought you didn't drink, Stooky! It's true, but I caught a cold. -Quartermaster Simon O'Meara! - That's it! A corvette... - ... it rolls and pitches. - Sailors at work. You are at sea! May heaven be with you! We get there sooner or later. Are the fish hungry? Quartermaster Smith. - Quartermaster Long. - THANKS. Matelot Shepherd. Sailor, Rogers. How much do we govern? 0-9-0. We keep this course until Ethel, then northeast towards Mary. There are three U-boats south of Ethel. - When will we get there? - Tomorrow evening. SUBMARINES REPORTED IN THE NORTH What are you doing? If you drop that, the U-boats will be tracking us. They watch for garbage. Return to your post. We wondered for a long time if this was going to happen to us, Chum. Do you remember? How do you feel? Don't tell me. I am in the same state. 52, 54. One day, he will miss his shot and meat himself, the Irishman. The farm! We can't sleep with all that noise. Great comfort, right? Here is the moon. The lights are masked? The men at their posts? Yes sir. Everything is in order. The moon made me romantic. Interception: ship torpedoed. He was hit 20 miles from us. Near Ethel. He must escape from a submarine. Probably unescorted. These solitary ducks take risks. We received an optical message: Heading to 0-2-5 for one hour. All right, obey. - It's in the direction of the intercepted ship. - Yes. We swept the whole area. Dinghy at sea in starboard 45. Looks like he's dead, sir. There's nothing else to say. Forward, very slow! Forward, very slow! Hook the canoe to the passage. Then we join the convoy. Yes sir. That's what I meant when I said, keep your sense of humor. HAVE RESEARCHED LIFEBOAT , NO SURVIVOR 5TH DAY 7TH DAY The sirens emit a signal in Morse code. They confirm their position in the convoy. U-boats can't hear? If they were this close, they wouldn't need this. It's mashed peas. - Should be foggy here. - For what? - So that you don't see your dirty face anymore. - It makes me crazy. - The farm! - I'm sick of you two. - What are you tired of? GOOD. Seven days since we passed Ethel. Continuing like this, we will arrive on Sunday afternoon. Maybe the Germans will stop fighting. How to know? - No radio, no news. - I doubt. Convoy 83 westbound from Iceland was attacked last night. - - Who are you? - The Star of Egypt. - Is that you, MacClain? - Yes. That Commander Smith? We leave the convoy. A machine problem. - How long to repair? - I do not know, but we can no longer follow. We'll catch you later. Don't hit anything with your small MacLain motorboat! Beware of salt water! Bye. We are alone now. Rally the gunners, double the day before. What's wrong with you? There were too many of us in this convoy. - I like them. - Who is that? The tanker guys. Glad they're with us. Me too. Mousse? Contact the Commodore's ship and send this message. "Star of Egypt leaves convoy Machine problem. Follows alone" - Yes sir. Hey! Stop that. What a rotten night! - Stop that noise! - I have enough salt in my eyes... ...to season the marinade. What's up guys? Happy to be in the army? - What is this? - Dinner. Do they cook anything here other than beans? It has eggs, but no longer very fresh! How can you cook in these conditions? Food is soaked! I can't take this noise anymore. Does anyone have a pair of dry socks? - I would have them on my feet! - Hope gives life. Hey pierre. Give me slippers. Next time I meet Winston Churchill. I will tell him: "Mr Churchill, does England really need parcels so badly? OK A grenade came off. Stay here. It's too dangerous. - Come down, we'll take care of it. - Check the other strings! Stuart, how many times are you going to play this record ? - No, sir... - Turn that off. Take it off! We've been hearing it for days , I can't take it anymore! Where have you been? The asdic is down. - I was busy, sir. - We did without you. - And the lemonade. - And in a plus. - Coffee. - It's purple - There is oil in the water. - What you find. Yes sir. - Nervous, Cartwright? - It's that record. - This record gets on my nerves. - We don't have to be nervous. To the machines, the men. When the action begins, the Boilermakers stay put. Then you will see that in corvette, you will not be the only one to be nervous. But nothing happens. Necessarily, we zigzag across the ocean to avoid trouble. We protect 40 ships and we are important to them. I know, I've been staring at them for days. Aren't you going a little strong? - How so? - This guy. he does a good job. - He's making progress. - A game of cards? You are tough on signs. You burned down Rawlins, one of the best. He's not bad. So this part? And Cartwright isn't always wrong. He is right several times. The first day he fished out our pup. I liked it. He's on watch with me. We can trust him with the ship. Could he watch alone? Not yet. But he learns faster than the others. It's up to me to decide. Of course, but I am your lieutenant, and I find you too severe. You demoralize some men. - Excuse me. Is Mr. Cartwright here? - No. I'm going to look in his cabin. He took a bad beating. How so? - What happened? - He was putting a grenade back in place. ...Which caused Cartwright to be hit. His head hit the railing. A bad shot. - Everything okay, son? - A bit better. - I'm just a little dizzy. - You should have told me. Are you injured? - Was it in my head? - No sir. - Let me look. - It's just a bump. He hurt himself. - What are you doing here? - I'm not awake. You always have to be. We fixed the asdic, but you have to watch him. - No other orders? - Do you want more? - I don't refuse them. - Excellent. Check the asdic and then, the stowage of grenades to avoid getting hit on the head. Help me! He passed out. We're going straight for a freighter! We no longer govern! - How are you? - Yeah, take care of Evans. - What's the matter? - It's his neck. He is dead. Take it down. Hang in there and steer upwind. Get help and block those windows. Cover the gangway. Add ropes to the railing! We lost the convoy. God knows how far they will scatter. I don't know what condition my feet are in. - You talk about your feet, while Evans. - Calm down! They are wet. Put that. Sorry. THANKS. The old man did a good job. A little more, there was no more Donnacona. Yes, it's true. - Dick got along with him? - Yes, like all of us. - With the exception of me. - Asks to be transferred. He's the one who doesn't love me. During your classes, was your boss in love with you? When you dropped a shell, the gunners kissed you? During training, you are not harassed as much. No, but in training they don't fight you for being a rookie. Has it ever occurred to you that this could be you? Stop greeting each other in front of the mirror. Am I doing this? When I joined the corvette, I was afraid of the commander. I was on the defensive, then I calmed down. Mr. Cartwright, the captain wants to see you in his cabin. - Try it. - THANKS. I want a ham sandwich with mustard and coffee. - Me too, sir. - What? I'd like a sandwich, but we're out of bread. And we're out of ham either. And sir, the is red-violet, I wouldn't recommend it, sir. - I was joking. Bring me some beans. - Yes. We stay on course until dawn, I hope we see freighters. Yes sir. You wanted to see me, sir? Let the helmsman know that we will be arranging a funeral. Yes sir. Can we do a quest for his family? - Certainly. - How's your head? How are you. It's tough enough to withstand a grenade. Do you play cribbage? No sir. So learn. I've beaten the lieutenant enough . Yes sir. 9th day: Storm. Convoy lost. 10th day: funeral. We immerse his body waiting for the resurrection and the light of the world through our Lord Jesus Christ. When he returns in his glorious majesty to judge the world, the sea will give up its dead and the bodies of those who sleep in Him in His glorious body, for he has the power to subjugate all things in his image. I am now immersing you in the sea. Amen. Shoulder weapon. Fire! Fire! Shipping company. Put your hat back on! Shipping company. U-turn, right. Dispersion! Merchant ships in 30 and 40 starboard. - They look big. - What's the heading? - 0-7-0. - Steer at 0-9-5. 170 rpm. Steer at 0-9-5. 170 rpm. We don't come empty-handed, we caught up with the convoy. What is our position? We are 300 miles from the Irish coast. - The sea looks calm. - Sir? Another tanker approaches. It's the Star of Egypt, sir. He said, "Hi, MacClain. Can't wait to see you." Tell him, "Let's take the next left towards England. - And: "No, I don't have any cigarettes". - Yes sir. Cigarettes. M. Send another message: "Trailed by U-boats since we left the convoy." That's all. We resumed our position on the starboard side of the other ships. Yes sir. Right, 30. We're going to zigzag 1,000 yards ahead of them. - It's good to see them. - So true. From the Star of Egypt, sir. They are followed by submarines. Be vigilant, watch the Asdic. Yes sir. It's pretty quiet. We should arrive the day after tomorrow. Cigarettes? - How's Stone? - He is fine. He dreams of his land in Saskatchewan. The coffee is getting worse day by day. I have two acres. I'm saving to buy more after the war. - What are you going to do? - Are you blind? As long as Her Majesty has a fleet, I will be part of it. - And you? - Me? Him too. He got married. We are safer at sea. - Can you identify them? - Yes sir. They are boches. - To DCA positions! - Yes sir. PULL. - Cease fire! - Cease fire! Gunners! Watch them scatter! This one wants it. Hello, the fold! He will surely not be able to reach the coast. Sir, a radio call. WTWT The pilot calls his ship. I hook you up. Hello, D like Danny, we hear you. I chase the other, he's heading for Berlin. You won't. Jump, we'll get you back. He escapes. Hi, finished. Good luck. The Boches must have given our position to the U-boats. Rally the gunners. Double the day before. Yes sir. AIR ATTACK U-BOATS REPORTED IN THIS AREA Rocket in starboard 35! One is touched. It is the Star of Egypt. To your posts! Close this shutter, so that no more light passes through. To the evacuation landings! Nice dog. Be good, Milton. Wear it down. Keep the canoes away. Leave the ship! Objective in starboard 30. - Submarine. - On the right, 20 and 120 rpm. Get away from the ship! He will jump! Aim straight ahead. How far? - 1500 yards. - 150 t/m. 150 t/m, Steve. Here we go again. Aim at 1000 yards. - Prepare to attack! - Grenadage by 10, sir? Grenade par 10! Prepare depth charges. Goal at 800 yards. 700. 600. 500. 400. 300. 100. - Fire! - Forward launchers, fire! Fire. Fire. - In the center, Fire! - Fire! - Last grenades. - Fire! Oil on the surface on the port side! Stop the machines. Prepare more loads. Prepare more charges for shooting. Just a minute, Joe. It's my finger that's there. - First charge! - First charge. Fire. Feu. - Second charge. Fire. - Fire. Enough explosive, isn't it? Return to 130 rpm. Good job, master. Thank you sir. And There you go! It flows. What do you think of the corvette now, Cartwright? It's the best ship in the navy. Tube number 1, ready to launch! Torpedo number one. Fire. Torpedo wake. Torpedo wake. Machines at full power forward. Zero the bar. - Tell the freighters to disperse. - Yes sir. At the evacuation levels! At the evacuation levels! Cartwright, what are you picking up? Objective, in starboard 150. Right, 30. Objective in starboard 45! Submarine! - Connect the fire hoses. - Yes sir. Maximum charge! Fire! 12 degrees to the right. Rear cannon, fire! Feu! Feu! Port launchers! Right, 30! We are getting closer. The commander is going to run into them! Bravo, Rawlins. Excellent! He's diving, sir. Come on! Stabilize. You got it! He breaks. Well O'Meara? Those bastards won't strafe lifeboats anymore. - Who fired on the starboard side? - Cartwright. THANKS. We got our revenge. Looks like there's something wrong. Lean on me. - Send me the chief engineer. - Yes sir. Do you know how to heal, O'Meara? I know how to pierce boils, sir. Take a look at this. We must get dressed right away, sir. I'm going to the infirmary to find what I need. - Good morning sir. - Hello chef. How does it happen? - I lost five men. - Is the hull holding up? - Yes sir. - Can we follow the freighters? It's tinkering. We should follow, unless it jumps. It's good. Tell them I'm proud of them. - Thank you sir. - Hello chef. Hello Mr Rawlins. - How are you sir? - Not bad. You are covered in blood. - Congratulations on the shots. - Child's play, sir! - Cartwright got them. - Yes, it's true. - Where's the navigator? - He's seriously injured. We lost 15 men, sir. Number 1 is dead. Smith is the sole survivor. Cartwright and you must assume. Get as close to the freighters as possible. At this speed, we have no chance. Yes sir. - The armament is in what state? - Equipment service won't be happy, sir. - Good, go back to your post, Rawlins. - Yes sir. - Well, doctor. Ready to start? - Yes sir. What is this? Whiskey, sir. To take a nap - while I... - Thank you, O'Meara. Need medics on those cans. For what? Do you have a corn on your foot? - Could you bring me more bandages? - There is none left. The tank is full of oil. Get up here and stay there. Come on, come up here. You can't do anything for them. Stay here. I will hold you. - Hi Tom. Ho are you doing? - GOOD. Wipe my eyes, they're full of salt. Of course. Merci. Don't move, Mike. It will be easier if you keep quiet. - Come on, John. I'm doing well. - Shut up, show-off! Driver Jones is the boss now. Steward, is there any sherry left? - Just a quarter of a bottle, sir. - Do you know driver Walsh? - Yes sir. - Bring him the rest. Sir. Men appreciate the way what you've been caring for them for the past few days. Merci. - What are you sniffing? Ireland, sir. I hope you are right. Raise the back watch. - How do you feel, sir? - Well, I... - You don't look well. - I'm doing well. I guess there is still no sign of land. Not yet. But with luck, we should arrive tomorrow. - Are you keeping an eye on the freighters? - Yes sir. They don't know what being we are in. We can still drop grenades. - How are the injured? - I think they'll be better soon. Men who need hospital treatment. - Yes I know. - But they're not complaining. Since they sing at the crew station. Help me, I'm going to stretch my leg. - Do you think you can, sir? - We will try. Mr. Cartwright sends this for Walsh. Commander. Repos. I don't have much to say. I just wanted to see you. I also heard that someone here still had cigarettes? - Here's one, Commander. - Thank you Tom. We'll be a little late getting there. But we have our six ships with us. That's what we wanted, isn't it? We won't be safe from danger only when they drop anchor. Then we'll have a good bite! A shot of rum is the best tribute... - A plane! - Look, he's English! Corvette Donnacona in sight, with six freighters. The Donnacona enters port with her brood. They call for help on board as soon as they dock. They waste no time. Green light from the docks, sir. A care team is waiting for us at the port. - Excellent. Forward, slow. - Forward, slow. Tell the freighters to anchor on their side. Yes sir. Cartwright. We arrived! I never doubted it, The convoy asks us to pass in front of them. - Why? - I think they want to greet us, sir. Alright. Williams! - Everyone on the bridge! - Yes sir. We just did our job! Will we be ready in time to bring them back? Otherwise, others will do it. She will continue, and others will follow because they are legion... Her legend and that of the men who fight for her... are an example of courage and hope. FIN
