Ok, ok, ok baby, alright. Hush now... Miss, didn't you hear little Amanda crying? Good thing you heard her, Ester. I just can't hear anything with headphones in. When you're busy, call me. I'll check on the baby, that's why I'm here. There's no need. The reason I'm here is to take care of her. I just didn't hear her because I had my headphones in. Head on back to the kitchen, thanks. I don't see you wearing headphones. Thank you, Ester. I just wanted to… Thank you. What do you like least about Chile after returning? I lived in Dubai for four years, um, Dubai! I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss it. A lot of things have changed since I left, though.. Four years ago, Instagram wasn't as important. Now it's weird seeing everyone promoting their lives, not just people like me. Is Instagram a big part of your life? Do we have to do the photos and interview at once? What does it mean to be Javier Matamala's wife? I don't think I've let it sink in. It means having... Assuming we'll live wherever Javier is playing. Is being a football star's wife a big sacrifice? Look around you. It's funner than anything. Rodri, take a photo of me and Andrea. - Of course. - Come here! I'm really... no... - I'm horrible. - You're beautiful, Rodri can do you over. Beautiful. Let's carry on the interview here. Rodri, Andrea is writing an authorized biography about me. She'll stay here with me a few days. Wow, great. Go ahead, ask me. Not like this. Alright, then I'll ask you. Why are you writing about me? I've been following your life for years. Did you get work done? A little. I could tell, but you should've gone a bit bigger like mine. Should we Instagram this? No! No. No, no, none of that will happen to you hon', because I can tell you how things are. How are they? He was looking at her all afternoon and she was looking back. Men are just dumb, Laura. They sneak peeks. But if you defend what's yours, you can tell him where he has to look. Right, when has that happened to you. Everyone knows my uncle is super-husband and dad, super faithful, and only has eyes for you. One time we were at Milan Fashion Week, Javier had been invited as the face of several brands, and a Russian model, named... We'll call her "Sluttanova". Sluttanova looked at him and approached him and when I saw Javier looking back, I went on alert, and that's what you should do, brat. Then at a reception, Sluttanova go there hotter than ever. And what did you do? I went up to her, looked at her and said: "You giant motherfucking tramp, son of a bitch, asshole slut". You made that up now. "Giantmotherfuckingtramp sonofabitchassholeslut" I'll never forget, I remember perfectly. Say it again. Giant motherfucking tramp, son of a bitch, asshole slut. And what did she said? Nothing, she didn't speak Spanish. Then what? I pounced and beat the shit out of her right there. No. And your uncle lost two of the brands because of his crazy wife. Was he mad at you? Don't know, don't care, he was looking at the slut. Plus... Plus what? I don't know, I think he liked it a little. He's so in love with you. So am I. Laura stayed over last night. She's a full-grown woman now. When she visited Dubai she was a little kid, but now she has boy problems and all that stuff. When I told her I came to visit you here she looked at me like "are you crazy?" and I told her I come here a lot, and you never say anything. I told her we were more friends than mother-and-daughter-in-law and that you're the best listener I've ever met, and that I bring you nothing but trouble. I'm not doing so good, Ms. Valeria. I've been having a hard time since Amanda was born. I don't know how it's done because... I'm annoyed by her crying, I'm annoyed when she's quiet, she bothers me, just being there… I tell you these things because I know you don't judge, because everyone else judges me, especially Javier, because he doesn't understand... how someone couldn't know how to be a mom, not with you as his example. Remember when you told me that... on Earth there are volcanoes... and whirlwinds? There are those who explode things and those who attract things. And you told me I was a big whirlwind. And that suffering a lot was part of that, but I'm suffering a lot and I don't know if I'm a big whirlwind. Or if I'm nothing. Maybe I'm not what you thought I was. And how are you? Have you been treated well here? That's not how you do it, dummy. Like this? No, it's the other button, you're shutting it off. I'm used to someone else taking my picture. Let me see, come here. Can you make a vacuous face? Yes. Shit, Moni. I'm sending you it, post it now, ok? Ok. I'm doing test photos for Beaut lipstick. Bitch, you got it! No, it's just a test for candidates. They told me I need 2 million followers to be the face of the brand. What are you gonna do? I don't know, they notice if you buy followers. I have to do something incredible. Moni. Bitch. I'm posting the photo, Vero. Listen to me! I am! Ok. I'm saying... What? That I'll have to do something incredible. Yeah, Vero, something incredible. And he said we might have to go back. Go back? Yes, but he wasn't serious. He was just mad. Well Javier, if we have to go back to Dubai, so be it. Alright, love. Let's just go back then. I don't know, Vero. I'm fine here. Well Javier, that's your job. We have to move all the time. Yes, but I already did my job and… Alright! And? Shh, calm down... What? You said "I already did my job and..."? Yes. Yes what? Oh Vero, that I already did my job, and I'm fine here, with our family, we're comfortable. Comfort has never been a priority, Javier. It could start to be. Wouldn't you like... What? What? Oh Vero, I'm putting the baby to sleep, please. Finish your sentences, Javier. Can I put her to sleep? Fine, then do that now, then come talk to me, ok? I can do two things at once. Clearly you can't, Javier. What's your deal, Vero? Nothing. No, really, what's your problem? Nothing. Tell me what it is. Nothing, Javier, nothing, just... I'm sorry. I get nervous about us having to leave again. But that's what I'm saying. It's just that, I also... get nervous about us stagnating because I'm used to us moving all the time. Honey, I understand, but relax, ok? Everything's gonna be fine. Yes, I know, everything's gonna be fine. With you everything is always fine. I love you, honey. What's wrong with her? Did she eat? Yes, she's just cranky. Who's my cranky girl? Who is it? I need it to be as detailed as possible. I understand. It's the way the procedure goes. I understand perfectly. Alright, I'm going to record then. Ok? Go ahead. I woke up early in the morning thinking I hadn't heard her for hours, I went to get her from her crib and I didn't find her, so I went running to my mom's room to see if she was with her, and on the way there, I saw the stair gate open. I must have yelled because I remember my mom asked me what was wrong with me. The light was off, the stair light, so I turned it on and saw her body on the floor. I ran down, I picked her up, she was cold, pale. I know I didn't react, I stayed there, on my knees... on the floor. Hugging her. I remember my siblings and mother screaming while I could do nothing. I just hugged her because I didn't want her to be cold. I thought that if she started breathing again, her little hands and feet would be cold. That's all I remember. That's it? I think so. Do you have a problem with this investigation, Ms. Lara? I don't think this is enjoyable for anyone, Prosecutor. Stating the truth can be enjoyable. Don't you understand I want to leave all this behind me? Look, I don't want to bother you more than I have to, but... You have to give into this situation, understand? Do you think I don't want to cooperate with the investigation? No. But I think you don't feel comfortable in this place so, you want me to be glad to be here? Why don't you understand this is very painfull to me? Calm down, please and please try to understand. I really want to finish this investigation, just like you do. I think you're kind of enjoying all of this, prosecutor and even if I don't think it's fair to do this all over again, I'm going to... so it can be solved. Princess, you're everything I need. Your love is what I needed to save the galaxy. Don't do it, Princess. Let's leave this place, let's let the galaxy explode into 1,000 pieces. No, Captain, my duty is to surrender to save everyone else. But it'll all have been in vain. No, you saved me and gave me your love, now I may fade away for everyone else. No, no! Princess! Captain, we have to get out of here. This place is going to explode. Princess... Goodbye, Captain. Princess, I will love you forever. Hey, you did awesome. Yeah, Vero's an actress, dummy. Thanks. I saw all of "Captain Legend" in one weekend. Isn't it awesome? I love that kind of animation. What the heck? You talk like a man. What? You sounded like a boy saying that, not a girl. Yeah, but girls can like animation too. Yeah, but they don't focus on the animation. They focus on other things. What else do you like? Dragon Ball, Evangelion, Robotech, Saint Seiya, I play FIFA too. Seriously? Do you play as Uncle Javier? No, He looks terrible, I hate his 3D character. Yeah. They made him too skinny. Right? Javier is a lot hotter. And how's Uncle Javier at playing FIFA? Terrible. Amazing on the field, but a terrible gamer. Where did you learn how to play? If I have nothing to do, I play the console. That must be pretty often. But out of everything you do, what's for you? Everything is for me. My husband is for me. My daughter is for me. You mean that family is most important to you. I love Javier. And little Amanda drives me crazy. And it's true that I'm wearing what some people earn in a month, but I need those things, I need people to look at me and... to be famous. And if you had to choose between that and family, what would you choose? When we went to live in Dubai I didn't enjoy it much I just had nothing to do. Javier trained all day, but not even two weeks went by and Javier got me invited to a TV program there. The show was only in Arabic but the production was done in English and there was one assistant who spoke Spanish. Horrible. I got to the set and proposed a character who was a model who didn't understand what was being said. It was a hit. So that means you'd choose... Family. Javier. Javier would make sure to fill everything else, as always. If you open a door for me, I'll do the rest. And Javier... Don't you feel he's a bit distant at times? Because, well, he travels a lot, plus, he works all day. But we've known each other since we were kids, I knew it'd be like that. He's always told me I'm his first priority. And being a mom? Being a mom? You saw me yesterday. I adore little kids. My life is for Amanda. You don't pay attention to me anymore. What are you saying, Vero? Just that, you don't pay attention to me. Since Amanda was born, you only see her. The same thing as before. Cut the shit. Love, look. You get home and you only spend time with her and I wait for you in the room and you never come. You only pay attention to her. She's your daughter, Vero. Because you care more about her than me. She should matter more to you too, she's our daughter. I want you to pay attention to me like before. I can't... because now we're parents. Why not? Am I ugly? No, you're not ugly, Vero. You're a mom. Am I old? No, love, you're not old. Put it into perspective, she's our daughter. Plus... Plus, I... I'm having a horrible time with the investigation and you haven't asked me anything, like how I've been, how I am... You're right. I'm sorry. I haven't asked you at all, I'm sorry. How is everything? Bad. Horrible. The same as before, Javier. Have they told you how long it'll take? I don't think they even know. You must be tired. Yes. That's why you're like this with Amanda. I don't know why I'm like this with her, Javier. Yesterday, Manuel, Jaime and I had a great time. I've never had a problem with kids, you know that. Yes, I know. It must just be the investigation. Yesterday I started looking things up online. Ok. And I deleted the history because I'm afraid someone will see what I found. What did you find? I guess it's pretty normal. Alright, see? Just relax, it's normal, everything will be fine, ok? Ok. Relax, love. Love? What? Let me do the photo with Amanda? So that's what this show is about. What show? All of this. To do the fucking photo with Amanda. No. No, love, think about it, I... I'll feel closer to her that way. I already told you what I think. We're not doing business with Amanda. Javier, please, I need this, alright? Beaut Lipstick has a lot of moms, and, if I do that photo with Amanda, I'll secure the account. We already talked about this shit. I told you what I think. So the show's over, cut the shit. Let Amanda be. Yes, ma'am, and she's highly recommended, she's even my cousin's wife's niece. How old are you? She's 22, ma'am. Let her respond, Ester. How old are you, Julita? 22, ma'am. And what do you like? What do you like? I like to work. And your only defect is an obsession with cleaning? What? I want you to tell me what you like. Ah, I like taking care of my siblings. I think that will be useful, - for your nieces, nephews and daughter. - You, you, for you, not for work. Answer her question. Ah, ok. I like your husband. Oh, I'd better be careful then. No, no. I'm sorry, I don't want you to misunderstand, it's just that my dad liked Temuco FC and we saw your husband score so many goals in 2002 before he left Chile, that is. Football fan. That's good, because Ester doesn't even know what a goal is. And I like you too, ma'am. That dress you wore last year at the Viña Gala. I dreamt about that dress. I imagined myself in it. How could you imagine yourself in the woman's dress? Ester. She's an ambitious girl, it's fine. Ok, ma'am. To be honest, I had a job back in Traiguén, but when Ester asked if there was someone, I said ”I'd drop everything to work for Ms. Verónica... That house must be full of celebrities, loaded with money. - Don't say that, honey. - Ester. I want to listen to her. It's just, why would I lie, I think my life could be looking up from now on. I'm a hard worker, or else Ester wouldn't have brought me. And it's not like I really believe that I'll be famous or make money, but if I stay working with you, maybe my life will change. I like you. I like you, Julita, welcome. And if you stay this honest, we're gonna be friends. Hey guys, how are you? I'm here at my pool, relaxing, sunbathing with these hotties behind me. Say hi, girls! Hey! And I want to invite you to share this video with a friend who you love enough to show it to. What? When I say "show it to", you have to put sunblock on Roberta, Moni. I know, I got it. Then why didn't you? You didn't say it! Pay attention, Moni, for fuck's sake. Hey guys, how are you? I'm here at my pool, relaxing, sunbathing with these hotties behind me. - Say hi, girls! - Hey! And I want to invite you to share this video with a friend who you love enough to show it to. Faster please!! Hey. Roberta has to go to the bathroom. She can hold it. Make a vacuous face. Hey guys, how are you? I'm here at my pool, relaxing, sunbathing with these hotties behind me. Say hi, girls! Hey! And I want to invite you to share this video with a friend who you love enough to show it to. I need 2 million followers to be the face of Beaut's new lipstick. Two million followers, that's a ton, what are you gonna do? We're trying with the horny old men demographic. It's the one that works the fastest. Vero! But how, posing naked? No, doing kind of dirty stuff on Instagram. That's what gets shared the most. A guy sends it to his friend and the friend starts following you. You're quite an expert. I like spending time with you. It's like as if you understood things. No, you have to put the eyeliner on in the direction of your brow, because if it's parallel, your eye will look tired. See? What? You know why things are one way and not the other. Can I ask you something? Ask me anything you want, grasshopper. There's a boy. Of course there's a boy. I like him, that's all. Yeah, I got it. But he just talks to me because I'm Javier's niece and because he's seen you in my stories. Ok. He "likes" all of your photos in the pool. Ok. I wanted to know if you could teach me how to do that. How to do what? I don't know, Vero, to take photos like that, to be... sexy. Then I'll take them at my own pool. What? What's his name? Who? The boy you like, dumb-dumb. Cristóbal. We're gonna make Cristóbal shit his pants. What are we gonna do, Vero? Make a scene, little brat. We're gonna make a scene. Do you want a tea? No, Mom, I have to take this for the diet. How's Javier? Good, around. We fought the other day. That's how marriage is. - There are good times and bad ones. - I guess so, Mom. Hey, do you want to come here for the eclipse? Your siblings are coming. No, I don't think I can, it's on Javier's birthday. I'll be doing a live video. Say yes to something, at least. Oh don't be dramatic, Mom. I always visit you, don't I? Yes, I know you do. I've always cared about you. Since Dad died, you haven't gone without anything. Yes dear, you have always cared about me, it's just that I'm older and I'm getting a little dumb. You know I love you, I'm not going to leave you alone. The thing is, Vero, I'm afraid I'll die without having seen little Amanda. - You know what scares me? - Yes, I'll bring her, Mom. Meanwhile, can I ask you a favor? Yes. If someone comes asking tell them you don't know my mom. What? There's a journalist writing about me and she could end up finding things out that shouldn't be public. You mean you don't want me to say I'm your mom? No, Mom. No, I'm saying that if they ask, you tell them you don't know her, you play dumb. She doesn't know about you, but if she finds out where you live or calls you, say you don't know me, ok? But sweetie... Do you want something bad to happen to me or Amanda? - No, no... - Then you have to help me, Mom. Alright. But bring little Amanda over. I'll bring her over when I'm not as busy. Do you want to take her, ma'am? No, leave her there, I'll watch her from here. Isn't the sun a little strong? I don't think so. But ma'am... Julita, are you going to obey me or not? Yes, ma'am. Could you get me that umbrella over there? Yes, of course. No, hon', it's for me. I feel like my skin is drying out a bit. But ma'am, hey, no, no... Julita. Yes, ma'am. You know, I have a couple of needs and I want to know if you can satisfy them. I can do whatever you need, ma'am. Good, we're gonna get along great then. Do you like taking care of her, cradling her? Yes, I love it. I'd stop her from walking if I could, she'd stay like that forever. Do you have enough time with her? Not as much as I'd like, actually. Since I travel a lot... when I leave, I get sad. But I know she's with Vero and that puts me at ease. Tell me a bit about your relationship with Verónica. Vero... Vero is everything to me. I'd never have gotten anywhere without her. That's why... I couldn't just call it a relationship because she's the world to me. But you had other girlfriends before. Yes, I had two. But my mom didn't like them. So that was a bad sign. And I can't tell you much about that because... Vero doesn't like that very much. Javier, say whatever you want. Then my biography will say "Verónica Lara is a jealous freak". I don't know what else it would say. I was a little kid, there were two girlfriends that weren't serious. What was the first thing you saw in Verónica? The first thing? When I saw her, I said. "She's super hot". "Wow, beautiful." I was pretty young, becoming an adult and I noticed that right away. I said "that woman is so beautiful, she drives me crazy." What did you like most about her? That she was always worried about everyone else. She's so nice. She lives for others. Is she the perfect mother? She will be. Then, She's not the perfect mother yet? No, no. She is perfect, she's the perfect mom. You should see my niece and nephews with her, they love her. Yes, I've seen her with them. She's sweet. Right? Mom's perfect isn't she? She's so sweet, isn't she? Yes? Amanda says yes, so it's a yes. She's hungry. Why don't you call Julita? No, she's fine with me here. No. She's hungry. Call Julita, ok? Do you want me to get her, Javier? I don't know, Vero. Should I call her? Alright love. Julita! The night of the baby's death, you didn't even call the ambulance or the police until three hours after finding the body. Is that correct? Correct. In your first declaration, immediately following the event, the night of the death you stated, "the little brat needs to be the center of attention". Is that correct? Yes, that's correct. Could you explain that statement to me? I was in shock for three hours, when the police finally came in, I started yelling, just then I realized what was happening was real. What I felt when that officer made me get into a van, was rage toward her. You felt rage toward your dead daughter? You've never heard of someone hating dead relatives because they died? Answer my question. Did you feel rage toward your dead daughter? Ms. Lara, I... I understand that you're used to always getting what you want, but here you'll have to follow the rules. Yes, Prosecutor, I felt rage toward my dead daughter. I was a kid. I didn't understand why that was happening to me. At the time, I thought I'd never be able to overcome it. From the declaration of your mother, Mrs. Anita Gómez de Lara, I've taken the following paragraph: "Every time little Camila got sick, Vero got very worried and told everyone, a lot of people came over because she wrote it on the computer." We also recovered information from the blog that you wrote back then. Let's see if you remember this entry. "Little Camila is burning up, I don't know what to do, I feel desperate as a mother, I want to die... I don't understand where you're going with this. Did you publish that entry? Yes. What's strange about it? How many times was Camila sick in her year of life? Several times, I don't remember. More than ten times? More. She was quite sick. And you published that information. What's strange about it? I was a little girl with a blog. Now girls publish all kinds of things on Instagram or Facebook. Answer my question. I guess it was a way for me to yell to everyone what I was going through. And did it capture the attention of those close to you? People worried. Like any friend would. Ms. Lara, Do you understand that we haven't closed this investigation because we're investigating you? That means that you are the main suspect in the death of your first daughter. Ms. Vero, How can you have the music on so loud? What? Give me the baby. The baby's so little, how can you have the music on so loud? What about it? What does that mean? She's just a baby, she's tiny. I didn't realize. "I didn't realize". You're a grown-up, you're too big not to realize. I'd just gotten a thought. You don't need to think, you need to take care of the girl. Who do you think you are, telling me how to raise my daughter? I'll just take care of her, ma'am. Give me her. Give me her. - But ma'am! - Go to the kitchen. From now on you'll have no contact with Amanda, now go. But why, ma'am? Julita will take care of my room and of Amanda, get out of here. Go or else I'll make you! I can't, Javier. She puts even more pressure on me. Yes, I understand. But I'm just saying, it wasn't necessary to threaten to fire her. She pushed me overboard. You know her. Yes, I know. But was the music on loud or not? Shit. Shit. Are you gonna blame me now? No Vero, it's not that. I just wanna know why she got like that, too. I don't know. Maybe the music was a little loud, nothing out of this world. Plus, you know Ester exaggerates when it comes to Amanda. Then what now? Now I want Julita in charge of the bedroom and taking care of Amanda. Ok. Ok. And I'm going ot talk to Ester so she isn't upset because I know it's important to you. Yes, Remember that Ester took care of me- -when your mom had no money, I know. Is Julita responsible enough? You'd die over how responsible she is. Ok, but so responsible that you'd leave her in charge of Amanda? I fully trust Julita, Javier. Ok. Love? Should we go out? Where? I don't know, dancing, to laugh a bit, have a good time. Seriously? Yeah, seriously. It'd be good for us, to release stress. It's been so tense here. Awesome! Thanks! It's great to see you like this, like before. We're gonna be fine, Vero. Ok? What's wrong? I want to go. What? I want to go, Javier. But why? I want to go, ok? Oh fuck. Don't play dumb, Javier. Why would I play dumb? You've always been a bad liar. Who's lying, Vero? You flirted with a girl right in front of me. I did? No, I did, idiot. What are you talking about? I don't understand this shit. You ask me out to get over the slump and here we are in another one. Vero, I didn't do anything. Oh you didn't? No. I saw you. You blew her a kiss when I was coming back from the bathroom. I saw you. Yeah, but she was a fan, that's how I have to be with them. That's your problem. Always. You thinking that I'm an idiot. I don't think that. Don't say that. I don't understand. Did you think I wasn't there? No, honey, why do you say that? I saw you. What? You showed the girl you had a hard-on under your pants, you fucking trash. What the fuck are you talking about, Vero? Look at me. I'm looking at you, what the Hell... Look at me. See, jerk? See, Javier? I'm sorry, love. Know what? Do whatever you want when I'm there, but please don't do anything behind my back, ok? Calm down. I'm going to be scared shitless all week that you're cheating on me. C'mon, calm down. Don't mix things together, don't exaggerate. How do you want me not to exaggerate? You ask me out to get over the slump and end up showing your dick to a girl in front of me. Fuck, alright. I fucked up. I was stupid. Forgive me, love. What do you want me to do to fix all this? Which of my friends do you like the most? No. - I'm not doing that shit. - I'm sorry, Javier. You know it's the only way to stop my jealousy. Moni, I need you to pay attention to me, ok? As if I didn't always pay attention to you. No, you don't, you're pretty dense. I need you to make a vacuous face, we're gonna try a selfie. I don't get your obsession with that. I told you I'd explain it to you, Moni. Hey, who are you watching the eclipse with? Dammit, you're doing a terrible job. Are you kidding me? C'mon, I don't understand. No, because you're thinking right when I take the photo, it doesn't work. Vero and her general theory of vacuousness. Why, is that a thing? Ah, I guess she hasn't bored you with that yet. Hey Roberta, could you please shut up? I'll explain it to you, Moni, ok? You know when people make fun of models for being vacuous? Story of my life. Yeah, but no one makes fun of vacuous actresses or vacuous singers. It's less common. Yes, that's because actress in general have to know how to act, and singers have to know music. Ok. The more you know the more you have to think, and if you're thinking you're not living, and if you're not living you can't enjoy it. I thought you'd say “ergo, blah... When people see a photo of you, what they want is to see you enjoying yourself.. Because they need to enjoy through you. Damn, you're right. If you're thinking, you're not enjoying it, and the photo doesn't work. It's less effective. This bitch is onto something. That's why we're her disciples. Verónica. I'm sorry, I didn't wanna interrupt but I'm ready, can we start? Ah, my style references? My parents... and some philosophers. It's like the clítoris... I mean, no, it's really like not having a clitoris. But for real... being vacuous is spiritual, too. Being vacuous is spiritual, too. I'd take out my ankles and... I'd get rid of, like, the double knee. Like not having a clitoris. Being vacuous is spiritual, too. How do you feel when you see this video? What do you think, it's embarrassing. It was the second most-seen viral video in 2014 outdone only by the drunk cow in Colina. Remember? Yes I know. Then you came out to explain yourself.. Huh? Look, I'll quote you: "Just as Buddhists seek the void, feeling so vacuous and with nothing to think or worry about, I can find a mental state in which I feel nothing, and I feel free at last. It's really cool." Are you trying to make fun of me, too? No. No, of course not. No. I want to understand you. To me it's quite clear, I just saw you outside and it's so clear to me that everything you say is for a reason or means something. Back then, we still lived in Dubai. And I came to Chile for two weeks, took advantage and did everything, interviews, to stay relevant here. I spoke a lot with Antonio Ovalle who was my makeup artist back then and he's so into that hype, of Buddhism and meditation. You could tell he didn't know anything, but he talked about it all the time. Those things happen to famous people. Ah, ok, and why did you make that comment? Do you want to listen to me or not? Yes. I went to one of the meditations with Antonio and it wasn't hard at all to do what the guide said, breathe, concentrate, let the thoughts pass. Then I bought some books about meditation, I started doing some meditations with YouTube, and I realized that the state I reached was similar to the feeling I had when I was carefree, when I felt everything was under control and I was here, which is what I felt with some drugs or when I go shopping. When you shop. When I go to the mall. The mall. And you realized all that in two weeks. Three or four days. I don't know, everyone who talked about what I said, pop culture people, actors, there was Dr. Flores. The psychiatrist. And playwright. Yes. I saw his interview, too. You're making that face because I know the word "playwright". Anyway. He tried to help me and no one believed him because a playwright-psychiatrist isn't interesting for TV. Ok. He called me, asked for a meeting, and I went to a café, my eyes were red from crying so much, and he was with a Sufi master. They asked me to explain what happened to me, what I felt, and told me that the emptiness was Sunyata. They validated what I was saying, even though they didn't really have to because that had happened to me. If everything you're saying is true, why haven't you explained it to the public? Well, first because Dr. Flores, who was the only kind person who approached me at the time, even if it doesn't matter to him, saying he validated me would be to ruin his reputation. We're the trashiest thing alive for intellectuals. Secondly? Because to continue explaining it would be to continue to provide material for misinterpretations. I'm a dumb woman, and that's what public opinion wants me to keep being. Everything you're saying seems so incredible to me. Yes, because you belong to a class of intelligent people that's so worried about what it means to be intelligent that you're not worried about being intelligent. The same thing happens in fashion. You're calling me dumb. No, I'm the only dumb one here. Dumb but enlightened. Not that it matters. I don't care either. You feel like you don't matter. Are you tired of coming all the way here, Ms. Lara? I want it to be over quick. Me too. I want to solve this case as soon as possible. Look... I'm going to be named Eastern Metropolitan Regional Prosecutor, so I have absolutely no interest in wasting time. Are you gonna turn your recorder on? Tell me, Ms. Lara, Why isn't your first daughter's death public information? And why should it be? Well, you even publish what you eat, I imagine a case like this would be very attractive for daytime TV programs. I'm terrified of being a bad mother in the public eye. And why is that? I'm actually terrified of anyone thinking I'm a bad mother. Explain. What do you want me to explain? No woman would want someone to think she's a bad mother. Why? Because I guess it'd be failing as a woman. You can be a permissive mother, a tough one, friendly, unfriendly, as long as you're in some way a good mother. Does your husband know about your first daughter's death? Of course. How could he not? I understand that... you hasn't started dating when the events took place, correct? Correct. It was immediately after, Javier saved me from the depression, accompanied me in mourning and was very understanding for years. Why didn't you have children before, then? That's why. Because when your child dies, you doubt bringing another into the world. How curious... Everyone who has made a statement in this case has highlighted your capacity to interact with children. I've always really liked kids, motherly instinct I guess. What children do you interact with nowadays? Mainly with Javier's niece and nephews. Laura is 15 and Jaime and Miguel are 13 and 11. And do you feel emotional when you think of them? I love them. Ms. Valeria, you're the only person I've never lied to in my life, and you know I visit you because I love you so much, and also because I need someone to listen and understand me. I haven't been getting along with Amanda very well, the attention she gets from everyone makes me desperate, I hate when Javier hugs her, I die of jealousy. I know that's so stupid, I know it's bad, I read that some mothers get jealous of their children but I've surprised myself feeling pleased... when something hurts her. I think... that I enjoy making her suffer, I don't know what to do, I'm burning from the inside out. Plus everything with the Prosecutor who's investigating me over Camila's death. I'm afraid because if they find out what I'm doing to Amanda, they'll think I killed Camila. I feel cornered, because... one thing is feeling this jealousy that causes me so much guilt, but another thing is killing someone, another very different thing is being accused of killing a child, it's terrible. Could you tell them what I'm telling you now? Hello. I'm Verónica Lara and I want to talk to you about a truth we cover up. Burn victims suffer discrimination every day from those who cross their path in the street and look away, lowering their heads, avoiding eye contact. For years, burn victims have hidden from the view of others. The time has come to change that reality. Burn victims can be unpleasant to the eye, but they have rights as much as you or I do. This month is National Burn Victim Acceptance Month. Care for them... they're like you. Cut! Is what I said alright, about them being unpleasant to the eye? Yes, we want the campaign to be direct. Of course, I'll do what you ask. I just got a call from the main face of the campaign and she's out. Who's going to replace her then? I don't know, I don't have time to search. The budget doesn't actually cover casting, we're doing this out of kindness. Well Vero, you did great in the video, Would you want to be the face? It's a national campaign. You think I could? Of course... you're Vero Lara. Everyone loves you. Alright, stop there, I'll do it. Hey Rodri! We might take a bit longer with the photo today, ok? No problem, however long it takes, what's important is that she's comfortable. Moni, come here! What? Come here! I need you to be nice to Laura, ok? Relax, she'll be fine. Yeah, remember how you were the first time you did this. How did you turn out? I don't know, I feel weird. Come here. You look incredible. Vero, did you tell Javier we were doing this? We're not gonna tell him. But what if he gets mad? Why would he? Wouldn't it embarrass him? Hon', that would mean me doing it embarrasses him. True, you're right. When will we post them? For the eclipse. Cool Vero, thanks! Ok, but I don't know how to do it. That's why you're with the best. Cristóbal's gonna drool all over himself. Who's Cristóbal? Laura likes a boy. C'mon, Vero! It's embarrassing. Relax, I fully trust Moni. Laura likes a boy who always looks at my Instagram. Should've told us before, let's make him kneel. Ready. Stand back here, don't think at all, enjoy yourself. Ok, Rodri. Now smiling. 1,2,3... Will you let her see the eclipse? With some tiny glasses? I don't know yet. What'd happen to a baby seeing the eclipse? What's the first thing you thought when she was born? That she looked like her dad and I loved her just for that. Laura was telling me what you did with her. We have fun. You're so good with kids. Since I've been here, I've noticed you're more distant with Amanda. Why? I'll tell you if you leave it out. Sure. Can I trust you? Did you know my dad and my children are communist militants? And when I publish this book, they'll never talk to me again. Why are you doing this? To be honest with myself. What do you want out of all this? A bit of what you have, to be close to you. I'm afraid of the attention her dad gives her. You're afraid he loves her more than you? What are you afraid of, Andrea? Publishing this book. I don't know what to do, Mom. I need to reach two million followers. Oh, honey! And how can I help you? You can't. I don't know why I come to worry you, sorry. No, you can always come to your mom's house, and if I knew how to help you, I would. I don't know what to do. And why is it so important, Vero? So I can be the face of Beaut. I have a camera test this afternoon, and next month they decide who stays. But... there's something you're not telling me. Just that if I get it, I can earn a little money, I can bring money home and Javier will respect me again. Oh love! I didn't know that was so important to you. You'll figure something out. You'll figure something out. Yeah, I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out. Raise your chin a bit. That's it. Turn to your right, very good. A bit more diagonal. Perfect. That's it. All set, thank you! Vero... did they call you last week? No. I guess they called other girls. And what did they tell them? Seems like they decided. At least in the next 2 weeks... it's hard. You have 1.1 million and they have 1.6 and 1.7. Then there's nothing we can do? Vero, you know I'd love to work with you. C'mon, don't be like that. I'm not saying it to make you feel bad. Juanjo, can you come see the photo? You can still get the followers. I'm going, I'm going, give me a second. Vero, the baby's crying, should I bring her to you? No, don't worry, I'll stay with her. Ok dear, I'll bring you to Mommy. Julita! Julita! Come here, what's wrong? C'mon. Amanda! Seems like she needs to be changed. You know, sometimes babies need to be smacked up to stop fussing. What? You ma'am, at home. You won't believe who we have here in the studio. She's a model, promoter, the first lady of national football, and she's here to tell us about a new campaign she's in. Let's welcome to Good Morning Chile our beloved Verónica Lara, an applause! Thank you. Hi, how are you, Carola? Very happy to have you here, Vero. Thanks so much for the invitation. So I heard you're here to tell us about a beautiful campaign promoting the Dahlia Foundation. But first, I imagine those at home also want to know, how has the return to Chile been? It's been a dream, Carola. I'm happy to be back home in my country. It was everything I wanted, really. I imagine, and how has your new life as a mother been? It's been a dream. I feel like, I don't know, I'm living the best part of my life. It's what I always wanted, to be with Javier, be a mom, watch little Amanda grow every day. I live for her now, Carola. That's lovely, Vero, wow. We're so happy you're here on Good Morning Chile. Thanks for the invitation. Now tell us, what's this beautiful campaign for Dahlias Foundation? Yes, it's beautiful like you said, I'm very content to have been chosen to be the main face of this campaign. It's called "Care for them... they're like you". Right, I'm told it's a campaign to create consciousness about burn victims, right? Yes, about how hard it is to be them every day, For me it's hard, and maybe you don't either, but I don't surround myself with burn victims, so… No. But when people see them in public, their burned faces, they don't look them in the eye. Oh! How scary! Yes. And that's because we're sensitized to the topic, we've naturalized that behavior. We're not used to seeing burn victims in public, Carola. No, and this campaign is precisely about sensitizing people to it, right? Yeah, actually. Today's the debut of the digital campaign. It should be coming up on my Instagram now, right? No? Yes? Is it on my Instagram now? Yes! Anyway, you can also see the videos of everyone who participated in this wonderful campaign, this incredible occasion, and the national campaign debuts on Monday. Alright, I was also told that it involves some beautiful photos you did with a burned girl, Yes, we're going to do them. Ah, you're going to. We're doing them tomorrow. She's a beautiful, lovely girl and... that's it, I'm happy and thankful, Carola, to make sense of all that we're doing. Thanks for sharing that experience with us, Vero, an applause for Vero! Thanks, guys. Thank you so much. We're going to a commercial break, but stay tuned. See you when Good Morning Chile is back, and look! On the bottom of the screen will be. Vero's Instagram to follow her now as well as the Dahlias Foundation's. See you when Good Morning Chile returns! Oh Vero, can we take a selfie? Of course! Oh! I'm excited. Alright. Another. You don't like it? No. Portrait mode? There. Thanks. There we go. There, pretty. It's so nice what you're doing. Isn't it? Very beautiful. Yes, and it's also in part to get followers, right? What? Just that. I was told you're hoping to be the new face of Beaut, but you need to reach two million for that, right? Carola, I'm doing this because I was asked to, not for that campaign. I'm not asking with bad intentions, on the contrary, I was the face of Beaut too, and... I think you fit perfectly with the brand's profile. Then you know perfectly well that to reach that goal you need much more than a campaign like this, Carola. Oh, then you're focused on that after all. I don't know. Give me a bit of a diagonal. That's it, excellent. Girl, I don't get why you wanna do the burn victim thing. Why, they offered it to me and I accepted. What about it? It's disturbing. It seems like you like it. Well, I do, so what? So then, it's not to get more followers? That too, and also because I like it. What do you like about it? Come here, Moni, I feel weird posing without you. But I'm not dressed. C'mon already, Moni! Ok. Ever noticed when you enter a room looking incredible... and everyone turns to look at you? Yes. All eyes are on you and in that moment, you're adored. Ok. When women have kids, they give in, and what do they get in exchange? Loving kids? No bitch, the kids love them, they need them. Ok. When you're with someone who feels pain and suffering, that multiplies by 1,000. - Sick bitch. - "Sick bitch". How long have we known each other Ms. Valeria? Fifteen. I came to tell you something that makes my stomach drop. I'm holding it in. And sure, I thought about telling you before, It's not that it bothers me, I don't feel guilty, I just wanna say it. And I know when I tell you, you'll want to tell Javier. I think saying it will help me do what I have to do. Nothing will change how grateful I am. Ms. Valeria, I threw Camila down the stairs. Make a vacuous face. More. Why do you do this? It's the only way to stop feeling jealous. More. Do you like that my lovely slut? Answer. Yes... yes. Goddammit, the same shit as last time. Are you gonna say I forced you? I told you I didn't want to, Vero. But you did it anyway. Because you insisted! You mean you didn't enjoy it? You didn't enjoy it, Javier? I don't know. Did you or didn't you, Javier? You were there watching. What does that mean? You saw me enjoying it. For fuck's sake, I'm sick of this. You're sick of me. I'm sorry, Vero. I'm sorry. What do you want, to feel better? Why do you want one of these? For Javier. Are you giving it to him for his birthday? I'm buying it with his money. And may may I know why? I need a garment of yours to trust you completely. Wasn't the thing about family enough? That's a result of the side you chose. I want a garment, find it and give me it. Why are you hiding your mother? You don't want people to find out about Camila? Or are you embarrassed? This is much better than a garment. Why are you obsessed with being the face of Beaut's new lipstick? Because representing a big brand and being on billboards nationwide is the highest thing I can aspire to. I thought you wanted to get higher. Like what? Like starring in a movie, modeling for a famous designer, going to Hollywood. You're crazy, I can't act. I'm not gonna fake it like a ton of other dumb bitches. Plus, modeling for a famous designer doesn't make you more famous. That's true. You have to know your limits. And being the face? What does that mean? It's like leaving your body. It's a bit pharaonic, right? The giant billboards. Yeah, maybe. Your face the size of a building. Promoting made-in-China lipstick. I'm not going to use it, it doesn't matter. Since you think so much about others, have you ever thought of those who have less? Of course. And how do you feel? I love them. I'm ready. Ok! Here comes Vero. Ignacia, can you change seats please? Hi, Ignacia. Hi. Beautiful, how great that we're doing this together. Yes! Are you nervous? Are you going to be famous? I hadn't thought of it like that. Alright, we're going to start. Ok. Vero, I need us to try different poses, affectionate ones. Closer to Ignacia. That's it, good. Let's go, we're going to start. Good, that's it! More affectionate, closer... Good, that's it, as if she were your family. Your sister, for example. That's it! And you're lying with Ignacia on a weekend. Good. Remember underneath it'll say " Care for them... they're like you". Ok. Hey! The client is asking if there isn't a girl with worse burns. What? They recommended Ignacia. I don't understand them, really. I'm sorry, Ignacia. Let's stop for a while, guys. Relax, honey, these things always happen here. - Hey, can we take a photo? - Of course. Now a sexy one. I like you. I'd bring you home, I'd adopt you! C'mon more sexy! Sexy. Ok Mom, it's fine, don't worry. I didn't know how to tell her that I wasn't your mom. Yes, I think that was better after all. Yes? It's easier to work with her that way. Alright. And how's Aunt Angélica? Your Aunt Angélica is fine. She complained that you don't visit her now that you're famous and all that. I'll go visit her so she'll stop the nonsense. Good, honey. Thank you so much. Don't be silly, Mom, I'll go because I miss her, what are you thanking me for. I just know that you're always busy. No. You have so many commitments. No, I'm not too busy. No, no, no. It's just that I exaggerate and fuss like you. You have a temper like your father. I'm sorry for always coming in a bad mood, ok? Now it's nothing, but when you were 15 you were difficult, alright. Dad loved you. And Javier loves you. Yes, I love him too. How did you do with the followings? The followers. That's it. I've got it figured out. That's why you're in such a good mood. Maybe. And what did you do? What I always should have done. I hate the Zonoids! Because they killed you. Because they invaded the planet. You don't like them because they killed you. No, it's because they're bad. What's bad about them? There shouldn't be bad guys. Without bad guys, there's no game. Vero likes to play with bad guys. It's comfortable being a good guy. Alright Vero, what's the worst thing you've done. No. I wanna know the worst you've done. I don't do bad things, Manuel does. The ones who do no harm are the worst. What did you do? What did he do? Once he went to the English teacher's and told her if she didn't show us her tits, he'd accuse her of abusing us. You're such a snitch, Manuel. What did the English teacher say? She called my dad right away. Why did you tell Vero? What a boring English teacher. And you, Vero? What's the worst thing you've done? An adult in my position owes herself to her audience, you have to do what your audience asks, even if it's bad. Like the photos you take with Moni at the pool? Like that, yes. And are we your audience? You could be part of it. But the audience is when you're at a place, when you go to a concert, that's the audience. At Uncle Javier's training there are 10 people. That's an audience. That's one way to look at it. And we're here with no one else. We're your audience. That's a very well-formed argument. And you owe yourself to your audience. Stop pushing it, Manuel. You're doing fine, but don't push it. Let's see, Vero. Show us your boobs. Only because I owe it to my audience. But first I have to make sure you won't tell your parents. Look, Manuel and I smoked marijuana and our parents don't know. If we tell, you tell on us. Jaime! You can't use dark sunglasses, they have to be special ones. Don't play smart with me, Julita. I've seen other eclipses with sunglasses, not these weird things. That's why you can't see a thing. Don't disrespect me kid, learn to respect your elders. Ester, Julita's right, you can't look at the sun without special glasses. What's special about them? They're paper. Listen to Ms. Andrea, she studied, not like you, dumb old lady. Don't speak to Ester like that, Julita. Yes, ma'am. And Ester, put the glasses on, ok? But I can't see anything, ma'am. If you look right at the sun, you'll see perfectly how the moon is blocking it. Ohh! Now I see it. It's kind of cold. Here comes Mr. Javier. Great, he's here, I thought he'd miss it. You made it, the darkest point is coming now. Ok! Ok! Happy birthday love. What's wrong? Let's talk later. What's wrong, Javier? Let's talk later, ok? No, what's wrong? Why are you like that? Why would you take that photo with Laura? And post it for the whole country? What about it? She's almost naked, Vero. Who cares, we did them for a boy she likes. Yes, Laura told me everything, and she tried to defend you. I don't get it, what's wrong with the photos? She's a child. No, she's not, she's a woman. She's 15. But not that kind of woman. What kind of woman do you mean? Stop messing with me. What kind of woman do you mean? My niece isn't a-. A slut. That's what you mean. Go to Hell. Honey, I know you're mad at me, but I really need you to let me throw you this birthday. It's ok Vero, I want to apologize too. I don't know why I reacted like that. No problem, love. And why are we here? I have a surprise for you. Oh yeah? Yeah. Can we turn on the light? 1, 2, 3. Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday dear Javier, Happy birthday to you! Surprise! No, Vero. Honey. I know I'm the one who's wrong. I ask you to do it, then I cry and blame you. But now it'll be different. I don't believe you. I won't do it. I want to give you a gift that's for you, for real. Tell me how I can prove to you that it'll be different this time. Nothing, because I'm not doing it. Remember what you told me, Ms. Valeria? In the world, there's volcanoes and whirlwinds. Those who erupt and those who carry water over it. Someday you'll be a great whirlwind, you told me. But we both know Javier isn't a great volcano. He's a world football star, a multi-millionaire, clean-cut, a great dad. I've actually never loved him more than I do now. But that's not being a volcano. Come in. What's this? It's a room I have for me. And that? Ms. Valeria. Mr. Javier's mother? Yes. I thought she was in the hospital. No, she died years ago. But when you told me you'd visit her and she wouldn't say a thing... I visited her and she didn't say a thing. Is that an altar? Something like that. Did you love her? A lot. Do you always come talk to her here? Always. As if she were listening? Yes. How come? To make a scene, Julita, why else? Take off her necklace. Put it in her mouth. Why? My daughter! My daughter! No! Why? Why? My daughter! "The Strength of Verónica Lara." "Vero Lara, the Mother of Chile." "The Death of Amanda Matamala." "The Cavalry of Verónica Lara." "Our Little Amanda." "The Lurid Javier Matamala." That one! Read that one. In the morning of last week, after news of Amanda Matamala's death shocked Chile a dark video of the national midfielder, the baby's father, was posted online, and the video exploded on social media in minutes. It shows the former UAE star having sexual relations with five women inside a sports car. His wife, Verónica Lara declared "I don't know how to deal with this, I'm mourning my daughter all at once." Surpisingly, in the first and only declaration by the national player, he said: " It was Vero who forced me to." He hasn't wanted to give any further statements. Meanwhile, the whole country mourns the death of Amanda. Listen to this comment. God be with our Vero, what an exemplary woman. Her baby dies and the disgusting bastard does this to her. She's like our greatest Patron Saint Carmen. There's nothing in Chile better than Vero Lara. She was just helping children with burns and now this happens with her husband and baby. An exemplary woman. The publisher wants to release the book right away. That's great news. How much did you charge for the video? Good enough. But why that car, Vero? To make a scene, Andrea. It keeps going up, how many is it at? It's about to be 3,000,000. And how are you? How do I look? Good. Listen. "Vero, you're Chile's light. I wish you strength in this dark moment." You're like a saint, isn't it annoying causing pity? Girl, I love it. What about Javier? He's destroyed about Amanda, he'll never forgive me. He doesn't care about the video, though. I bet it'll be cool in the future, to have a video having sex with some girls on a car. But he insists in blaming me for Amanda. What did he say? That I'm a bad mom. That it's my fault she died, it was my carelessness. What so you think will happen to Javier? With deep respect for her fortitude as a woman, we welcome Vero Lara as the new face of Deep Red Woman Lipstick. I'm so sorry about your daughter, you're a grand woman, a symbol for Chile. Thank you so much. What just happened only adds information to our investigation. So there will most likely be another one about the recent events. What do you want from me, Prosecutor? You seem recovered. I'm better. Not precisely at the moment. Yes. You were never comfortable here at the Prosecution Office. What's your obsession with me? Why do you do this? I wonder, how do you do things? How do you work? I don't understand. What don't you understand? You're sloppy, careless, impulsive. Prosecutor, I think there are people who like to talk and people who do things. And you, do you do things? Yes. And when I leave here, I'm going to tackle this problem. What problem? This misogynist persecution you're carrying out. What persecution? This intimidation. Are you going to publish it? And the public is going to find out. I thought you wanted to keep this investigation private. No, I don't care, the whole country knows I'm a bad mother. I don't think that's the whole country's opinion. No. It's not the whole country's opinion, in fact, there are many who think the contrary, and when the public finds out, they'll judge you. Well, that's part of my job. And it's going to keep being part of it. You won't be named Regional Prosecutor during a media scandal. Verónica Lara is not just a mother, wife, or celebrity. She's a mourning mother, a betrayed wife, a celebrity under the judgment of those who hate what shines too bright. Verónica isn't just the face of a lipstick brand or department store, she and her pain are the face of an entire nation that lives in shame, the face of an enormous woman who overcomes all. She's the poem to our women's fortitude. This book is an attempt to answer the question: What's hidden behind that face? I love it, Andrea, really. Really? Really-really. Selfie? Selfie. Send it to me, please, to post it.
