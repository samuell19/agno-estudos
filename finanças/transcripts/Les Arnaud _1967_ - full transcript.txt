THE ARNAUDS ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY BY LEO JOANNON -Good morning, Mr. Arnaud. -Hello. How about this weather? Beautiful. It's funny how happy you always are, considering your line of work. It's the bicycle. It gets me going. All these nuts with their cars-- it stops you digesting your food, and it makes them all upset. -Good morning, Mr. Arnaud. -My respects, Mr. Arnaud. -Good morning, Mr. Arnaud. -Hey, dear friend. How was your ride in, Mr. Arnaud? Top of the morning to you, Mr. Arnaud! Chin. Liver. Plexus. Face. Liver. Plexus. Liver. Don't run away. That's it. All right, Michel. You're hitting better. Your left is a little soft. But your right... -I hope I didn't hurt you! -No. Oh, damn! Here, Andre. That's too much. Shh. I won. -No! -Yeah. For once. So don't complain. You can thank poker. Thanks, poker. You can taste them both. Here. And these two, if you want. 60 francs. -How's the Saint-Marcellin? -Smell. Listen, if I buy three, can you give me four? You haven't changed. Why are you always so tight-fisted? Because my money's always trying to get out of hand. -Here. -Thank you. -There you go, handsome. -Thanks, ma'am. Thank God I've got you to run my errands. With these legs, I'd never eat. This looks delicious. That's my special tripe! Tripe for a man! Tripe that sticks to your ribs! Just what you need after boxing. What's this? An anniversary present. Saint-Marcellin. Whose anniversary? Ours, Mrs. Bouvier. I've been living here three years. 3 years of home-cooked meals! Oh, this devil! So, Zorro, you just come in without knocking? The door was ajar. I just followed my nose. Smells good in here. Brochures? No, it's the young man's money order. From his uncle. His uncle from Manosque. There. Thank you. Thanks. Bye. Can't wait to see you again. -Bye. Bon appetit. -Bye, thanks. For the room, and here, for the food. That should cover it. There's no rush. There's always a rush to pay debts. I'm sorry, Mrs. Bouvier, but I start early this afternoon. Let's dig in to this tripe! Here. Careful, it's very hot. JUVENILE COURT No admission. -My lawyer. -Right, I know you. Mr. President, I am here as legal guardian. My brother, who's in Africa, asked me to look after his son Bruno. It is thus within my rights as representative of the victim, who is a minor, to demand, in addition to the criminal sanctions the young assailant should be charged with, compensation correspondent to the damages inflicted. We have had to pay significant medical costs. And also I hurt really bad. Poor thing! We must also take into account the physical suffering, the pretium doloris. May I ask the social worker how much the assailant makes? Small-time shepherd,120 francs a month, plus room and board. "Plus room and board." Which means 120 francs pocket money. He can pay. It'll teach the little brute a lesson. Have a seat, Mr. Jassoron. Could you summarize what you were told regarding the incident, since you did not yourself witness it? My nephew, who is a peaceful child, had gone to play in the neighbor's field, where the shepherd Ange Martin's herd was grazing. All of a sudden, without my nephew provoking him in any way, this little thug came after Bruno with a sickle. I didn't do anything to him. Nothing at all. Ange Martin, do you confirm this version of the facts? Well, Ange Martin, speak up. Well, Ange Martin? Cat got your tongue? This court is going to have to punish you without having heard your side. This is outrageous! Everyone has a right to a lawyer! And you are? Andre Arnaud, fourth-year law student. "Arnaud"? With a D? With a D, Your Honor. You're a student, and you're already a member of the Bar? That's miraculous. I'm not a lawyer, but the law-- The law is my concern. Apparently. So if you'd like, follow what happens next and learn something. Tell me, Ange: Is it possible you're intimidated by French? What about Provençal? Do you like caramels? Oh, right. You're a man. You'd prefer a cigarette. I like caramels more. I'm the same way. -Ma'am? -Thank you. Thanks. If the clerk would be so kind as to give the defendant one. My nephew will take an ice cream bar. My most sincere regrets, but the court has none. So, Ange? Will you tell us what happened now, you and Bruno? Do I still scare you? Do I look like the police? What about my rabbit face? Have you seen that one? Watch. So it's a circus now? Tell me, Ange: When Bruno came into your field, did you argue a little? Yes, but he started it. That's not true. I didn't do anything to him. He was saying how at home he eats steaks and cream puffs. What do I care what he eats! I take care of my sheep, that's all. And then he said some bad words to me. What "bad words"? He called me a "fosty." A "fosty"? Because I'm in foster care. Provocation. Yes, I heard him, sir. When did you grab your sickle? When he started scaring my sheep with his rifle. Your nephew had a rifle? You didn't mention that. It's a toy, Your Honor. But his sickle was no toy. He cut my arm. Your arm fell off. The court will postpone its ruling. I intend to take some provisional measures. Miss, Ange Martin is to be immediately released from jail. Excuse me? I say, that's not fair! Indeed, Mr. Jassoron. Prisons aren't made for children. In the Basses-Alpes, I believe there are honorable families who have requested aid for work in the fields. The assailant, Ange Martin, must be put some distance away from his pained victim. Please take care of this at once. What about my damages? If not prison, then at least money. Mr. Jassoron, I know you well. We're neighbors. You are a very wealthy antique dealer. So wealthy, in truth, that you have a reputation for lending money at usurious rates. That's not the point. This court is adjourned. Might I have a moment of the student's time? Say, young Arnaud... We might be cousins, you and I, even though Arnauds in Provence are as a common as Duponts in Paris. I've seen you here before. Yes. Are you interested in juvenile delinquency? For my doctoral thesis: "Minors and Responsibility." So that's why you're a regular here. What does your father do? My parents are gone. I'm sorry, excuse me. Has that been hard? Financially, I mean. Yes, but I'm managing. I have an uncle who's been really cool to me. He sends me money. The poor guy's only a bricklayer in Manosque. Soon I'll have my law degree, though, and leave him alone. If you're interested, I have some books on juvenile delinquency here that you won't find elsewhere. Feel free to borrow them whenever you like. Thank you, Your Honor. Caramel? Say, what you did to the antique dealer back there... What can I say? A man who doesn't like caramels... See you soon. Peking! Peking! Murderer! Law to the liberals! Go back to Peking! Murderer! Go back to Peking! Murderer! Liberals! How long has this been going on? Five minutes at least. Cluzet can't teach. It's starting to wear on me... Make them shut up! A professor comes back from China... Long live Mao! China to Peking! -Long live Mao! -China to Peking! Long live Mao! Finals are going to be great with all this noise, just wait. All right, you put on your show, now maybe we can work a little! -Ass-kisser! -Excuse me? I said "ass-kisser." Clear enough? No, I didn't quite catch that. Can you repeat that for me? Ass-kisser! Ass-kisser! You brute... I have just said, in the dialect of Peking, that constitutions are like pretty women: made to be violated. Which brings us to the overhaul of matrimonial law by the latest legal measures. In the history of societies, at least European ones... Are you coming to Youth Club Friday night, Andre? Friday? What's on Friday? You know, the TV report. Friday's not Sunday. I'm working. You're starting to be a pain with your work. I'm asking you to come. For me. He beats up Dominique and Paolini; now he's feeling up our cousin? -This is getting to be too much. -Don't worry about it. It's Tina Marcacci! I'm a Marcacci, too, and I mind my own business! -So shut up! -The contract should be identical to that of the first marriage. Save some for Friday. A recent law, dated July 13th, 1965... Poor darling, you bought enough for a whole regiment! You never know these days. I'm being careful. Long live the King! I'm just warning you, dear sister, that you're becoming an old maid. Already happened. -Give me that. -Hands off! Now's not the time to get dirty. -Why? -Mrs. Raynaud is on the patio. Nelly? You won't even recognize her boys. They must be 20. Nelly has a favor to ask. You should spiff up. -For Nelly? -Yes, for them. I'm irresistible regardless. -Don't you know it. -Right... That used to be the kennel, what's left of it. This is the deer run. There's still some. -Back there... -Nelly. Henri. My sons. Jacques, Philippe. Right? -Righto, Mr. Arnaud. -Hello. -How are your studies coming? -I'm going to Navale. I'm at the École Nationale d'Administration. Congratulations. I'm so proud of them. I hope you spoil them. That's what I'm here for. I came to see the huntsman. Yes, but they want very nice ones. And you know me and guns... So I said to myself... You came to the right place. Come on, chaps. Let me show you around the artillery. At your age, you want a 12-caliber. Come here, kids. A Pardner! And this is a Holland. Mom will never buy us this. She doesn't have to. They're my gifts to you. No, we can't accept that. I don't hunt anymore. I got my share of birds. That's quite right! A whole flock of floozies! No, darling... Oh, you were referring to game! Right. -How can we thank you? -No need, my boy. Henri, this is really too much... The hearing is adjourned. Give them some cartridges at least! -Don't go killing my pigeons. -Of course not, Mr. Arnaud. Pigeons! For once we could eat them! Thank you again for the guns, Henri. No, no... I'm actually here about something else, though. What is it? A marriage proposal. One of your sons? No, I'm getting remarried. Congratulations. With whom? With you, Henri. With me? With your consent, of course. Seriously, do I look like a widow? Not at all. Nice grouping! Look at that! At that distance! You're a real pair of cowboys. You think it's going to work out between Mom and Mr. Arnaud? -Oh, boys, you know... -We'd really like it. Your brother is a swell guy. Please understand, Nelly. It's not that you're not charming. You're very beautiful. A lot of good that does me! You're as attractive as ever. Do you remember our first balls? When you preferred your warehouse girl to me. Lydia? Yes, that's right. I loved Lydia. Should have married her, then! Yes, I should have. You haven't forgotten her? Some of the dead aren't forgotten. If I could have imagined that that girl-- That shade. Would still be between us today? No. There's something else between us, Nelly. Your success. You have everything: fortune, beauty, two brilliant sons... And no husband! "No husband..." Look, Henri: You love kids, and mine adore you. I only get attached to children in prison. On the outside, they don't need me anymore. -St. Vincent de Paul... -It's not that. Besides, he only took them in as infants. If I understand you, you're reserving yourself. Perhaps. Who knows? Perhaps one day someone will knock at my door. Someone with nothing. There are people who have nothing, Nelly. Nothing. How's it going in here? -Well... -I see. It's over. Don't despair, my poor Nelly. Come back to see us. Perhaps the pastry chef won't figure in. The pastry chef from the Rue Thiers. -Is it that important? -Yes. Because from time to time I'm going to buy an apple pie, supposing... And Tuesdays, a Saint-Honoré, and Fridays, a frangipane... And on and on... -Here you go! -Thank you, sir. Thank you again, Mr. Arnaud. Come back soon, Nelly! Promise! No. No. Goodbye, Henri. Too bad for your boys. They were all right with it. You know I love you, but here we are, alone together, like every other night in this great big house. For our series on today's youth, we've come to the Cultural Center of Aix-en-Provence. The University of Aix-Marseilles, specifically the law school, has many foreign students. -Canadian. -Canadian. -You're English? -Yes. -And you too? -No, British. Oh, excuse me. Nuance. -And you're German. -Yes. -And you're Swedish? -Yes. Dutch? I'm from Marseilles. Third year in Law. Oh, sorry. Now to the islanders. Long live Corsica! Now let's go see our friends, the American students. What do you think of parents? Our parents are too far away for us to judge them. The whole Atlantic Ocean is between us and them. What an answer! He must be from Normandy, not the US. Do you agree with those from Aix who think that parents are at fault? Parents are always wrong. That's a good principle. Like, about sex. They're hypocrites. They say it's all we think about. What about them? If we're here, it's because they thought about it. All right then. Let's speak to the others now. What do you think of mothers and fathers? That's tricky for us. Why? Because we're already parents. They're so young. That's crazy. I don't think so. You don't seem to agree. About parents, or money? Money. I don't agree when they say we don't care about money. We act like idealists, but we're like everyone else. We care about money. You'd like to make money? I think about it. Are you ambitious? I don't know. Maybe. I mean, we're all ambitious. We're studying so we can succeed. Success isn't bad. -Oh, it is bad? -No. What about not succeeding? It's stupid. I think we've just about run out of questions. A telegram for Andre Arnaud. He's at the youth club. I can't go, with my poor legs. I'll take it. Thank you. You're such a good boy. Thank you. Look at them. -Look! -Forget it. Are you nuts? -Forget about it. -Idiot. There's vendetta in the air. -Last warning, Tina! -Last warning, Pascal! Let me handle him. I said leave him to me! This doesn't concern you all! Dance! You, idiot... I'm an adult, I'm vaccinated, and I'm free to do what I want. Yes, but you're a Marcacci! Darn right I am, and we fight back! When your brother joined the army, he said to me, "I'm trusting you with my sister." You two are exactly the same. Primogeniture is over! This isn't the Middle Ages, and we're not in Corsica here! Andre! What's going on? My uncle just died at a construction site. This is all we found at his home. I'm not surprised. I always wondered how he managed to send me money. He loved you. That's all. When you love someone, you make do. But there's something else. His gold watch was his only luxury. He wore it on Sundays. If I were you, I wouldn't sell it. I wouldn't think of it. We're going to head back. That's the job. I'm going to wait for the coach. Please excuse us for leaving you alone. It's time I got used to it. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Bye. -Why didn't you tell us? -You know, funerals... In Corsica, funerals are sacred. It's nice of you to come, especially you. There's fighting, and then there's hard times. They're different. -You got hit hard... -So we're friends now. True friends. It's a nice watch. Come on. Let's not stay here. -We're sticking by you. -Come on. Your Honor, we should go to the public prosecutor with Mr. Deschamps. For Rose Gabrieli, aggravated theft. Repeat offense. Go ahead. Speak to the assistant prosecutor to get him to be lenient. So many indictments he has to send down. Here. One for you. -Caramel? -No, no. How are you going to manage now? Apply for a scholarship? Yes, but I can't until October. So? My friends are looking for work for me. They have family in Aix. And your law degree? I'll keep going to school. I need a part-time job with mornings off. My landlord is really cool. I don't have to pay her rent until after my exams. All I have to pay for is my food and tuition. With 2,000 francs from here to July, I'll be OK. It's not hard to come up with 2,000 francs. 2,000 francs... I promise I'll do what I can to help. Thank you very much. Where can I reach you if I find something? At Mrs. Bouvier's, 4B, Rue Celony, with a Y. He's not Corsican, but he's a friend. No, cousin. Part-time secretary, you're not serious! It's not possible. Too bad. Thank you. Say hello to your family! An employee who doesn't work mornings, that's half an employee, and that's not enough. I'm sorry. I can't help you. SALES DEPARTMENT Too bad. Give my best to Uncle Paolici. Miss... So what, you want me to send my morning customers over to the law school? Come on. OK, I'm sorry. Thanks anyway. -Three of a kind, queens. -All right. Say, Fred, have you thought about my pal? Your part-timer? No can do. The unions don't like part-timers, and I don't want any trouble. -Too bad. -Ante up. UNIVERSITY FINANCIAL AID OFFICE So? Still nothing. It's down to the wire. I've got to find some dough, or it's "So long, law degree." I'd even work as a waiter. -Oh, no. -Excuse me. That's silly! 4 months before finals... Listen, Andre, we'll go to my bank... Right, I'll take out a bunch of cash, put on a suit and some fancy shoes, is that what you want? You disgust me. Tina, I told you already, I don't want your money. You're stubborn, but less than me. It's stupid! My money's just sitting there. I need money, but I know where to get some. Where? I know someone. Going to the courthouse pays off. March days are still quite cool. I get cold easily. Obviously you don't. Youth... 2,000 francs, that can't be much for you. No, no. I have it here, and more. This week's receipts weren't bad. Say, I haven't offered you a drink. Have a seat. Sorry, the house is empty. That's Sunday for you. The help's all gone. It's a desert. Don't offer me anything. Just lend me something. The 2,000 francs? Why would I lend it to you, my boy? What's your collateral? Your brilliant future? You've got to be kidding me! Say, it's you... You're the one who intervened at Judge Arnaud's hearing. "Outrageous! "Everyone has the right to a lawyer." Like some Don Quixote. I get it. You don't want to lend me the money. You're getting revenge. Not at all! I thought you were a hit back there in court! A real bull! What makes you think I won't lend you the 2,000 francs? Here. Here they are. Do you need a receipt? For the guarantee? No. You and I can work it out another way. "Another way"? How's that? I said, "You and I." What am I'm asking for? A little emotion. Life has been such a disappointment for me. So having some company, preferably handsome company like yourself... Beauty... To have beauty and youth around me... I hear you're a boxer. You're strong, quick, and you have soft skin... Don't go anywhere or I'll shoot! -Go ahead! -Stop! Stop, or I'll shoot! 1 million, market price. Oh well. And his little brother; 500,000. There. Now listen, and listen carefully. I'm going to call the cops. I'll tell them you attacked me to take my money. The shot fired, that was you, not me. But you missed. So we fought, and we broke everything. Then I took your gun off you. You understand, now? You see that you're good and done for, you little bastard? You can always deny it. With no money and no family, they won't believe you. You agree? They'll believe me, right? Don't do this! This is my whole life you're ruining! I'll do it! You'll get hauled into court, and they'll give you the maximum! Hello? Police? Don't call! Don't call. Police here. We have your location. Villa Jassoron, Galice Way. We're on our way. See you later, Gaston. -Till next time. -Yep. Arnaud! Arnaud? Arnaud! You don't like it? No, it's good. You've barely eaten a thing. -You're not sick, are you? -No, I'm fine. Oh, by the way... Here's for the room. I told you, I don't need it now. I don't need it anymore. Yes, you do. No, I worked it out with a friend. But I don't have any change. We'll see about it tomorrow. I'm full, Mrs. Bouvier. Goodnight. There'll be no prints on the gun with the fire. What else do we have? Jassoron was sentenced three times for receiving stolen goods. Looks like a score was settled. What do you think? If Jassoron was hanging around with the wrong crowd, it often ends this way. The killer didn't touch the money. Excuse me, sir. There's 2,000 francs missing. Really? I checked his weekly receipts. There's 2,000 missing. Yeah. That doesn't mean much. He could have lent out 2,000 to someone this morning. And if that someone killed him? Why would they leave two million? It doesn't add up. It's simple. Jassoron wasn't honest, and he paid the price. Let's head to Marseilles. Toulon, Nice, Frejus, and we'll still be working... ANTIQUE DEALER KILLED "Jassoron affair: "Ange Fantacini, 28, "from Bastia, no profession, "was interviewed by Inspector Gambier before being released." It's always us! Corsicans, we're either cops or crooks! He's playing emperor... Long Live Napoleon! Members of the jury, despite my client's ugly mug, he did not bump off the antiques dealer. What's more, he's a half-witted good-for-nothing, -a worm... -When cousins marry! Where are you going? I'm going home. I have to work. Isn't Ange Fantacini a cousin of the Francis? -You think so? -Yeah. They're related to the Santucis. Come in. Hello, ma'am. My name is Henri Arnaud. -The judge? -Yes. -Would you like to see Andre? -Yes. Is he here? No, but he usually comes back around now. He should be here soon. Come in. Excuse me. -Is this his room? -Yes. It's not much, but... In any case, Ms. Bouvier, I congratulate you. I know you help the boy out. And he deserves it. I guess I help... Sure you do. You give me credit. He told me. And credit, these days... It didn't last long. He's an anti-debt zealot, that boy. "Anti-debt"? He doesn't like to owe people. Sunday night, he paid me back everything he owed. Sunday night? So he found some money. Yes. A friend lent him some. A rich friend at that. He had quite a sum. -Really? A schoolmate? -Yes. I hear him now. I'll leave you with him. Andre, you have a visitor. -Hello, sir. -Hello. I have some good news. I found you a job. Really? A friend of mine, an attorney, Mr. Lacassagne, agreed to hire you part-time. 500 francs a month. That's great. Here. An advance. An advance is better than a loan, right? Of course. Excuse me, but I have to be going. -I'll walk you out. -See you soon. ANTIQUES Nine... And ten. -There's no one here. -I'm getting the posters. Go ahead. FACULTY OF LAW EXAMINING MAGISTRATE OZIOULAR JASSORON AFFAIR Hello, sir. Have you heard the news? The murderer was arrested. What? They arrested him early this morning at his home. He confessed? No, not yet, but he will. The evidence is overwhelming. The examining magistrate has been grilling him all day. -Do you know who it is? -A young man. -A client of mine? -An accomplice: A fourth-year law student. -Do you know his name? -No. Try to find out. I have a meeting at my office. Let's go to reception. Your obstinance is absurd, young man. I'm telling you, I didn't kill Jassoron! We need to finish up. Yes or no, did you lose 1,800 francs two weeks ago at the merchants' poker game? I never denied that. But you couldn't pay your debt. You didn't have it. You asked for some time. -Yes or no? -Yes! Yes! On Sunday evening, March 12th, the night of the crime, you came up with 1,800 francs and paid off your debt. Is that true? Yes. You know that 2,000 francs were missing from the antique dealer's home. -What proof is that? -It's proof. As long as you haven't told us where you found those 1,800 francs, we'll never believe you didn't kill Jassoron. I swear I didn't kill him! Then for the hundredth time, how did he acquire the 1,800 francs? I gave the money to my son. It's a little late for that, ma'am. Let's be serious. We're going to ask you where you found it. Mr. Dieudonné, could your wife have been in possession of this sum? No. Well, ma'am? Where did you get this money? Did you win at the races? Ask Dr. Martin, the dentist. I have the name of the student who was arrested, Your Honor. Michel Dieudonné. It's all over, he's done for. I have to go. I have a defense to plead. I need to attend to something. I'll be back in an hour. But we still have several cases to go over. Do them with Mr. Deschamps. Today, the practical work of criminal law, a subject too often neglected in fourth year. As usual, I need a student to take my place to lead the debate. Arnaud! Arnaud! You love your champion, I see. Well then, Arnaud. Yeah! Bravo! What do I get, professor? Forgery, part two? No. A legitimate defense. OK. Ladies and gentlemen, which circumstances can absolve an individual from having committed manslaughter? Mr. Foffa. The president speaks! Article 328 of the penal code states that manslaughter is legal if cases of legitimate self-defense. The president has spoken! Good, Mr. Faffa. OK. Now, the statutory grounds for exemption. Mr... Ms. Tina Marcacci. Teacher's pet! Teacher's pet! Silence, please. Even if it's true. Ms. Marcacci? Exemption from punishment is rare, but it can occur in certain cases. These are? Cases in which the victim was wounded without his life being directly threatened, or in self-defense against a burglar, as stipulated in article 322. And finally, article 324, which as a woman I find disgusting, which permits a husband who finds his wife committing adultery -to kill her on the spot. -Vile! Horrible! -Sick! -Awful! Disgusting! Two cheers for 324! That'll teach the little slut! Which conditions besides the threat of death and adultery can be grounds for exemption? None other. Well answered, Miss. Is that your opinion, colleague? Not quite. Criminal courts have in the past excused manslaughter in cases of blackmail. That's correct. But careful, Arnaud. Blackmail in these cases assumes the existence of a shameful act the individual needs to hide. Not necessarily. Please explain. There could be conspiracy. Indeed, that could occur. Listen closely. This is very interesting. Go ahead, Arnaud. Give an example. I don't know... Say there's a crazy person who wants to lead an honest man into depravity. The man refuses. To get revenge, the other person devises a situation that could ruin the honest man. He's caught in a trap. He knows he's innocent, but he can't prove it. So, faced with the threat of a ruined life, a life so rich in promise, he kills... He kills to survive. That's a legitimate defense. Yes, in a sense. According to what is fair, perhaps, but not according to the law. But it's entirely plausible. Yes... Not bad. I hope your peers took notes. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Let's move on to forgery. Forgery, which we'll discuss just a little of today, comprises two main subdivisions: the forgery of public and private documents. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5! 1, 2, 3! Yeah! -Blackmail! -The lawyer you'll make! No. The judge. I can just see you now attorney general. "You murdered the landlady. You cut off her head!" "With a handsaw!" Look, it's Judge Arnaud. -Hello, Your Honor. -Hello. Ms. Marcacci, the Honorable Judge Arnaud. -Good morning. -Miss. Say, Andre, I had no idea you were such a good lawyer. -You were in the lecture hall? -Yes. I'm an old student. Speaking of students, I have some bad news. Bad news? Your fellow student Dieudonné has been arrested. Michel? Why? He's being accused of killing the antique dealer. Really? It can't be him. It's a mistake. The evidence all points to it. He's a gambler. I know Michel... There's no way he could... You have to do something, sir. Get him out on bail. No. No, I'm all for punishing the guilty. Criminals in prison and good boys hard at work. Speaking of which, did you meet with Mr. Lacassagne? Yeah, I start on Monday. I'm glad to hear it. You'll be able to pay back your friend. My friend? The friend who lent you money. That's what Mrs. Bouvier said. Right, of course. That proves that there are very good people in life. Am I allowed to know who this good Samaritan is? Does he have a name? It's me. Is that so! You, miss? Yes. I lent him some of my savings. Do you know a more honest person to lend to? No. You made a very wise investment. Andre has a bright future. See you later, kids. Tina, I need to tell you-- No, Andre. It's my turn to speak. If you ever have something serious to tell me, there's only one thing I want to hear, that you love me. JUDGE'S QUARTERS "Article 61 of the penal code: "Any individual who helps "or tries to help a criminal avoid arrest "shall be punished." Excuse me, Mr. Arnaud. An urgent letter, Your Honor. You wished to see me? -If I'm not bothering you. -Give me one moment. "Any individual who helps or tries" "to help a criminal avoid arrest..." The witness, Martin Paul, dental surgeon, single, residing at 23 Cours Mirabeau in Aix-en-Provence, declares the following: "On Sunday March 12th, around 11 in the morning, "Mrs. Marguerite Dieudonné, with whom I enjoy friendly relations, "paid me a visit "and asked me to lend her the sum of 1,800 francs "so that her son Michel could pay a gambling debt. "I acknowledge having given her this sum." By signing below, you hereby confirm the contents of this deposition, Mr. Martin. This hearing is adjourned. Michel Dieudonné is free from further proceedings. -I'm free? -Yes, but give up gambling. It often ends up poorly. Is that a promise? Goodbye, poker? I promise. -Come in, dear friend. -Excuse me. I need another moment. I've just been brought an urgent letter. Please. Back to square one. See, Your Honor, our first instinct was right. This was gang violence. We should head back to Marseilles and Nice. No. Likely the Jassoron affair. Here's the 2,000 francs that were missing. The killer sent them back. -How nice. -Touching, even. Yes, except that I don't know any crooks who pay you back. It's not a professional. There's no doubt about it. Posted from Aix. We should be looking here. What? -May I? -Go ahead. The envelope is signed. What? Look. The "S" on the typewriter is damaged. "Osioulas," "Jassoron." There are more than a handful of typewriters in Aix. -Then I should get started. -Don't waste time. I'll get you a search warrant. Clerk, "Conformant to Article 251 of the criminal procedures code, "I, the Honorable Ernest René Osioulas, "in charge of the case regarding the murder "of Mr. François Denis Jassoron..." Don't leave, dear friend. I'll come back at a better time. "... hereby request..." The police chief. "Police constable." "... to process all information "regarding the murder of Mr. Jassoron." -Where are you going? -To see the judge. To tell him your friend is innocent? There's no need. Michel Dieudonné has been released. He was able to prove his innocence. See? I was right. Come with me. You need to forget about this, Andre. Focus on your studies. And get some fresh air. You don't look so well. What would you say to going fishing? Fishing, you know... It's fun. I'll teach you. How about tomorrow? No, I have to study tomorrow. We'll study together. On the shore. Is that a yes? I won't take no for an answer. Great. So, you know the Cadenet bridge? Take the road that heads down toward the Durance. I'll meet you there. I can count on you, right? 8 a.m. How am I supposed to get there? You have some good friends. Borrow a bicycle this time. If it's important to you... Great. See you tomorrow, then. Sausage, chicken, pâté, sardines, cheese, and four hardboiled eggs? Just for you? Yes, well... Fishing really takes it out of me. You have two glasses. -Two glasses? -Yes. Ah, you're right. One for water and one for wine. The... salt. It's in the sideboard. Right. I wanted to tell you, if something were to happen to me, I don't know, an accident... Everybody's mortal. You should know that there's some cash in my desk, along with my will. Your will? You never know what could happen. Why are you talking like this? I'd just die, are you OK? I feel perfectly fine. Look how hungry I am! -You're going fishing tomorrow? -Yeah, so? You can't swim. What if you fall in? I'd shout. There's no one on the Durance on weekdays. Let me come with you. No, no way. You talk too much. You'll off scare the fish. -I'll tell Gaston to come, then. -Gaston? He works on Thursday. Who goes fishing on Thursday! I see... This is about the baker woman... Pretty quiet out here, huh? No one comes here during the week. Peace and quiet is very important. That's what fishing's about, first and foremost. Fish don't like rocks. Are you bored? Yes. Well then... Let's get to work. Obligation of the buyer. Civil code, 750. "The obligation of the buyer is to "pay the price stipulated in the sales agreement." Good. I think I've got a bite. So, little fishy, have you decided? You don't know that I see you, do you? Little roach. You're not scared of me, are you? You think I'm Officer Certain? Except that I pick up my line, and... Missed it. For now. Real coffee! Better than their instant stuff, right? My line... I've got him this time! Look at you. I'll keep you for the Fromentane pond. Into your prison your go. Speaking of prison, Andre, there's news in the Jassoron affair. The guilty party sent back the 2,000 francs. I guess there is such a thing as an honest murderer. Sugar? What's interesting about it is that it reveals a lot. At least, I can imagine pretty much what must have happened at the scene of the crime. Call it my judge's instinct. Jassoron was accustomed to lending money. So someone who needs to borrow money winds up in a room with Jassoron, who's a bad guy. I know as much, I judged him myself. Really, a bad guy. Don't you agree, Andre? You were there. So, what happened at Jassoron's villa? What did this bastard say or do? We have no idea. But it's clear that the borrower became furious, and the two men fought. And the unlucky borrower shoots... And voila. It's almost an accident. But it's still murder, Andre. What do you think? That is how it happened, isn't it? I'm not mistaken. And now... I'm going to take a little nap. I'm going to go over there and lie down in the shade. It might be a bit close to the edge, but you're here to keep an eye on me. Don't let me fall into the water. I can't swim. At my age... Plus, I've got a cruddy heart. I'd sink like a stone! See you later, Andre. I can't swim. At my age... I'd sink like a stone! No one comes here during the week. Don't stay there. It's dangerous. Thank you, my boy. Let's get back to my lesson. Provocation to murder. The guilt of the person who incites someone to kill. No. What's important for me is recidivism. How can one know whether they're dealing with a one-time criminal or a real killer? How can you know, Andre? By testing them... No! Don't go! Listen to me! Don't go! Wait for me! I'm not done! Adoption. -I'm sick of your lessons! -Article 343. I'm done! I'm being serious! Let me adopt you, idiot. Now it's time to adopt? "Adoption can only take place if it presents an advantage." "The adopter may not disown a child or legitimate descendent." "The adopters must be at least fifteen years older." See? It's all here. Are you kidding! If I adopt you, tomorrow we'll go to the notary. We're already halfway there: We have the same last name. Arnaud and son. What if I refuse? You won't, and you know damn well why. Right. Because I made a mistake. Not "because." If I adopt you, it's simple. My solitude, and yours. Your future, and for me, my duty as a man to help another become one. That's all. It's absurd. We're not from the same world. I've got a real moron for a son. Listen up, blockhead: When I was 23, I almost married a poor working girl named Lydia. You could be her son. Our son. As it happens, you have her eyes. So if you want to talk about different walks of life... Come on, my boy. Let's pack up. Come on. Help your father pack up. And stand up straight. And you, little guy, let's let you go. You're not strong enough yet for prison. Maybe later, though. Yep. Not now. Good luck. Your search warrant is a convenient scapegoat. But I won't violate mail protections. I'm not opening anything. I'll just compare the handwritten letter from Aix to this envelope. Your list is complete? Names and addresses for every rented typewriter in Aix? Yes, sir. Thank you. You don't use any other typewriter? This is the only one I have, detective. Very well. Thank you. Sir? EQUESTRIAN CONTEST -Your typewriter is new. -Eight days old. Ah. What did the officer want? To see the typewriter. Impossible! Sure it is, dean. My detective isn't mistaken. The envelope addressed to the judge was typed up here, on this machine, in your university, in this room in the law school, where any student can enter. In my opinion, one of your students is suspect. But that's the clock from your room. I don't need it. I can't hear a thing anyway. He can use it. Students are always checking the time. Henri! Leave the poor boy alone! -What? -These ties! Young people don't wear them anymore. But it's Sunday. And besides, he's my son. Speaking of which, I saw the notary. We're signing the adoption Tuesday. Tell me, Henri. Just between us. I'm your sister. What do you want me to say? -This boy... -Well? Did you have a little "bastard" with Lydia? No! I would have recognized him a long time ago. But then... -He knocked at your door? -Yes. Good thing. Yes. What's going on? I have no idea. That does it, a professor skipping class! It's been three hours. Where the hell is he? Refund! I don't understand. He only wants what's best for you. Sure, but the idea that he'd be my father is too much. You've always been a rebel. Yeah, well, for you, the idea of being a judge's daughter-in-law someday... How dare you! I was kidding. When are you moving in with him? Tonight, theoretically. Students, Detective Certain has a search warrant to question all students. As president of the law students' association, I protest vigorously that violates the secular traditions of our university, which, like the Sorbonne, is a sovereign institution. This is justice, not the police. Power must remain with the law. Silence! Chief. I will proceed in alphabetical order. -Almirez, Jean-Pierre. -That's me. Please follow me. The school's surrounded! No. You can come in, but you can't leave. I had an alibi. My in-laws. Arnaud, Andre. We have to stop it! What are you waiting for? Go! What a mess! The attorney general called. Do something. I'm the president of the student's association. None of us will evade justice. I guarantee it. But get the police out! -Out? -Yes, out! Get out, cops! Get out, cops! Get out, cops! Where were you the evening of Sunday, March 12th? That's a while ago. Usually, I go to the boxing club. You must have had a partner? Of course. His name? Hang on... Well, sir? Your partner's name? You haven't forgotten his name, have you? Hang on, I remember. I didn't go boxing. Then what did you do? What's this about? Get out, police! -Get out, police! -Quiet! Quiet! Calm down. Inspector, do me a favor and suspend your interrogations. The students' are very upset. This could go south. I won't give in to threats. It's not about giving in. The students association has promised me that they'll answer all questions as long as the interrogations are held outside the university. Justice, yes. Police, no. Help me out, Inspector. Fine, but this only buys them time. I'll walk you out. You OK? And you, Joan of Arc? I'm Andre Arnaud. And I'm Aunt Belle, your father's sister. Let me give you a kiss, nephew. You have nice eyes. That's important. You have a certain person's eyes. Where's your bag? -I'd like to see the judge. -"The judge"? You have nice eyes, but you're formal. That'll pass. Come on. "The judge" is in his room hitting his fingers with a hammer. I've brought your son. Andre. So? You two met? Yes. -And your bag? -I'd like to speak with you. Alone. -Alone? -Yes. I'll go back to my Ferrari. What's going on? I came to tell you that I'm turning myself in. What? Enough of this game of cat and mouse. I'm the murderer, and you know it. Yes, I know. So? You don't know what Jassoron wanted me to do. No, but I believe you. Have a seat and calm down. I didn't confess because I knew I wouldn't be acquitted. I didn't want to lose everything because of him. I've worked too hard for that. Yes, but... Now? Now, I know I'll never make it out. I'll be found out sooner or later. In the meantime, I'm making a mess for everyone. The police surrounded the law school. Even for you, I know what you're risking by not turning me in. You could lose your license or even go to jail. Yes, well, that's my business. It's my business, too. I'm turning myself in. You won't get past me. I don't take my orders from you. Yes you do, my boy. I'm your father. No. I never signed anything. We have a meeting at the notary next Tuesday. Go to hell! I'm an adult. Listen to me! It's fine this way. I thought that if I worked hard, I'd end up on the right side. Nothing doing! We all have our role to play. You as a judge, and me in my hole. Come on, Andre. I'm going to see my people, the born losers! I studied law, well, now I can give them some tips! Come on. Come on, Andre. No! I'm going to the station! That's out of the question! Not in the state you're in. You have no idea what prison is like, Andre. The hopelessness of being in a cell, the inhuman lack of privacy... You need an iron will to survive in there. You hear me? Later, when you're stronger... Tell it to the fish! I'm going to the station. I'll stop you. I'll stop you! I'd like to see you try! Just wait. You can go three rounds against a featherweight, so you think you can hold your own against someone 45 pounds heavier? Get this! The judge is a boxer! Yes. The judge in question went varsity, kiddo. And he can still put 'em up, -if you want to find out. -What's wrong with you? I'm very sorry. You all right, my boy? I'm OK. Dad... Yeah, not bad. The nitroglycerin... -In my jacket. Quick. -Which pocket? The right. It's true, what I told you out fishing. I've got a cruddy heart. You shouldn't have fought. I had to. I'll do whatever you want. Listen, Andre: I think I'm going to be all right, one more time. But if I ever have to leave, promise me you'll live here with your aunt. You'll replace me till you have your degree. Then, when you're a man, an Arnaud, then you can turn yourself in. I promise. What's going on? Nothing. Everything's fine. I'm here with my son. I like him just fine, your son. Yes, but he has one small problem. He doesn't wear a tie. Well. Wonderful. Congratulations. What's for dinner? "In the presence of Mr. Jacquet, notary in Aix-en-Provence, "Mr. Henri Arnaud, judge, residing in Aix-in-Provence, "Galice Road, who, by this document, "declares having adopted Mr. Andre Arnaud, law student, "residing in Aix-en-Provence, 4B, Rue Célony, "who consents to becoming his adopted son." Your tie. "The ratification of this adoption contract will be "carried out by request at the court of Aix-en-Provence. "Contract read and approved in Aix-en-Provence "by the undersigned notary, and upon approval, "signed by the parties with the undersigned notary." A pure formality, but the adopted has never been convicted of a crime? No. Not yet. Nor have I, for that matter. I had no doubt. Now comes the solemn moment. If you would sign the agreement, gentlemen. Congratulations, my dear judge. But I have to add a note of regret regarding the news I heard this morning of your resignation. What? I'll explain later. You made the juvenile court a model of excellence. It was your entire life. Now it's time to devote myself to being a father. I had many children, but never a son. Excuse me, sir. One moment. -Excuse me. -Go ahead. Why did you resign? When we go down the station to turn ourselves in, I don't want it to be a judge being arrested. Follow me, featherweight? Stand up straight. Excuse me. May I? Ah, here she is. Have you heard? She had the delivery in Switzerland. The judge took his time. Look closely: He has the same chin. The Arnauds use to have a lively young cook. He's the spitting image of his father. They're awful. As you can see, it's a charity sale. I can tell they don't like me. They won't accept me. You think so? Mothers are always looking to marry off their daughters. You're already a member. -It's awful. -Mothers never change. You know the Huguette girl? Perhaps Andre would like to come to the country and play some tennis? He doesn't have time. Before his exams, we'll mostly be playing civil law. -She's charming. -Indeed. Excuse me, I believe we know each other. A few days ago, at the law school. We were chatting when that gang of savages arrived -with the lady. I recognize her. -Exactly. You know, I'll be continuing my interrogations. What with Pentecost, I couldn't resume them, but come Tuesday, just wait. Since I have you here, Mr. Arnaud, tell me what it was you did on March 12th. That way, I won't have to bother you. Sunday, March 12th, Andre Arnaud. Andre was with me. Perfect. Thank you for your statement, Your Honor. Of course. Miss, since you handle a crowd so well, could you get me an orangeade from the buffet? Certainly, sir. You lied. Yes. For the first time in my life. I couldn't avoid it. Whose turn is it? Will and testament. -Again? -Yes. You say it's the notary's problem, then you get blown off. Article 967. "All persons can benefit from a will, "either as an heir, "or according to a legacy, "or any other act of denomination indicating a will." "One's will." The same will can be written by two or more people. Are you kidding? No. "A testament cannot be created by two or more people..." -"Either for the benefit of..." -"Of a third "party, or for their mutual benefit." -Good. -Form. "Form: Handwritten, public act, or sealed will." The nature of the contracts. That's more interesting. Andre Arnaud, it is with great pleasure that, in light of your final exam, passed with honors, the faculty hereby awards you the gold Gabriel de Lumière medal. Thank you very much, sir. Pierre Thomieu, it is with great pleasure that in light of your final exam, passed with honors... What is it? Don't you think it's time? For what? To go to the station. Not yet. First you need to stock up on hope, that you know what's waiting for you outside when you're on the inside. OK, father. I'm good. I've never been so good. I think it's time to go. -Now? -Yes, now. It's going to be hard. What are you going to tell them to defend me? The truth. That you're not a killer, but that you were unfortunate enough to kill to defend your future. And I'll also tell them: "Return me the one I chose, for he was in danger of losing himself. "Because one day he had to be brought, freely, "to justice, justice he himself demands now. "Return my son to me, my son whom I have forgiven, "I, the judge, "at the selfsame moment I chose him to be my child. "Don't let him languish in your prisons. "Return him to life." Subtitling: Hiventy
