Sussex England, 1905. Stop it! I said stop it! Right. I've had enough. Juliet! Mother! Mother! Mother! David! David! Please! David! Please! After the loss off my twin sister, my mother took me back to her home in America. I didn't return to England until 1928. As professor of psychology at Camberley University. Psychic phenomena. Does it exist? Sir, your book denies its existence. As I have said before, the purpose of these lectures is not to discuss the contents of my book, which, by the way, is doing fabulously well, and I urge all of you to run out and buy a copy. What my book simply begs for, Liam, is proof. I am not here to change any of your precious beliefs. But what I am here to tell you, is that when you investigate psychic phenomena, you must adopt an objective and scientific position. Now, if you want my opinion: There are no ghosts. No spirits. No angels. There is only the longing that there should be. To ease our pain and our fears. Bless you for coming this evening. I can feel the excitement of our loved ones on the other side. Join me. There is someone here who... who wishes to speak to Clare... I'm Clare. Jeremy? Hello, Clare. You must stop worrying about me. I am very happy here. Come and talk to me again. I have lots to tell you. Will you do that, Clare? Jeremy. Is there someone named Brook here? Ed? Edward Brook? Ed Brook? There a... There are so many who want to speak. Charlotte... asks if her son is here. My mother was Charlotte. Hello, dear. I want you to know I'm very proud of you. I can see your doing very well. Are you all right, mother? Is aunt Lily there with you? Yes, she's here. Does your broken hip still hurt you? Oh, nothing hurts anymore. Except being away from you. Ladies and gentlemen. My mother wasn't named Charlotte. She was an American. Never broke her hip. And I don't even have an aunt named Lily. This woman is a despicable fraud. Oh my God! Brooks! Get him out. Get him out of here. Hello. Ladies and gentlemen. This is my mother. This is a fraud. Madame, you are despicable. Why its terrible, its terrible., I mean why did you do it? You should be ashamed of yourself. Have you no conscience? Look... I... its... different... Wrong... You can stop the performance now, they've all gone. Leave... can't... do... this.. You'll... tell... ever... You're pathetic. David! David! Please... Please! Where have you been? Come on! Race you home. Post. Thanks, Kate. Is all that for me? Your book appears to have hit a nerve. They all want you to come and investigate. My article on Madame Brontski... I hope it will put her out of business. She's written again. - Who? - A Mrs. Webb. Mrs. Webb? Let me see. Oh, yes. Older women. Isn't she the one who thinks she's being held prisoner by evil spirits, or something similar. That's her. She says you promised you'd come and see her. Promised? I most certainly did not. And I don't have time at the moment. Her letters have become more desperate. Is she local? Sussex, I think. Edbrook Hall. Edbrook? Edbrook Hall. I suppose I could look in on her. David Ash? - Mrs. Webb? - No. I'm Christina Mariell. Nanny Tess asked me to meet you. - How do you do. Nanny Tess? - Mrs. Webb. We've always called her Nanny Tess. - I'm so sorry I'm late - Oh, it's quite all right. Quite all right. And you weren't quite what I expected either. - Shall we go? - Yes. So, you're from the colonies? Chicago? You're very clever. Not that clever. It was in the authors note of your book. At least your honest. Oh, doesn't mean I'm not clever, just means I can read. I've never met a real American. Actually, my father was English, and I lived here until I was eleven. So you still haven't. Nanny would have met you herself but she's afraid to leave the house. Its quite disturbing to watch someone you love begin to slip away like that. I fear this will be a dreadful waste of your time. Well, hopefully I can be of some help. And I promise to keep you entertained. You drive this? Sorry. Put your luggage in the back. Where did you learn to drive? I didn't. This is my first time. What? I'm only joking. I watched my brothers and picked it up as I went along. You're very funny. Welcome to Edbrook. I found him, Nanny Tess. Hello. She can be a bit strange. It's this ghost business, she's obsessed with it. Have you ever seen one? No. Mrs. Webb? Nana Tess, don't be rude. He's come here for you. Thank you, Professor. I'll show you to your room. Oh, don't worry, Nanny. I'll do it. We'll speak later. What a fabulous house. Is there just the two of you living here? No, my two brothers, Robert and Simon should be around somewhere. And of course, Nanny's ghost. Oh dear... I know I shouldn't, but I can't resist teasing her. We teased her so much as children. I hope you'll be comfortable in here. Oh, I'm sure I will be. When you've unpacked your things, I'll show you around the house if you like. Oh no, no, please don't trouble yourself, I'll show myself around. Help yourself, go anywhere you like. Dinner's at half past seven. Do you think she's imagining everything? Don't you? I beg your pardon. Hello. Do come in. Robert Mariell. - David Ash, how do you do? - Yes, yes of course. Well, quite a novelty having a professor in the house, hm. Is it? You being looked after? Yes, yes, the room is very comfortable... - Good. - And, um... This house, it's magnificent. My great-grandfather bought the place. The Mariell with the money my father used to call him. I suppose we do rattle about a bit. We try to use just the parts we really need. Rather difficult to run a place like this, without a proper compliment of servants nowadays. Oh, yes. It must be. Things aren't quite what they used to be for the Mariell family. No doubt poor old Nanny will be telling you. Yes, Mrs. Webb... You know, it really is awfully good of you to come. And I think I owe you an apology. An apology? I gave her the book. Nanny. Your book. And that started all this nonsense of you coming down here. Anyway, now that you are here, I want to give you all the help I possibly can. Good. Listen, you don't think someone could be playing a practical joke on Mrs. Webb? - One of the locals, perhaps? - Oh good Lord, no. We're so isolated here. And Nanny hasn't had much to do with anyone for years. She a bit of a recluse, you know. - You met Christina, of course. - Yes. You painted the portrait in the corridor? Yes, yes, I did. Do you like it? Yes, I do. It's a... very striking. Funny thing painting, you know... At its best it captures the soul of both painter and the subject. It makes them both immortal. - Hello David. - Hello. It's so peaceful here. Makes one wonder why we choose to live in towns at all. - Have you met Robert? - I did. He's very charming. He must think the same of you. He normally doesn't let anyone watch him paint. Oh, then I'm honoured. Tell me, does he always use the same model? Could you suggest a better one? It was a joke... It was a joke! I didn't mean to give you a freight, old man. I'm Simon, the joker in the pack. How do you do. The last swim of the season, you don't know what you're missing. Fancy a dip? No thanks, it's a little cold for me. As you wish. I'm coming! Here I come, I'm coming. Hey, give me that! Christina! Christina, give me that! - Thank you, David. You're a gentleman. - Come here... Which is more than I can say for my horrible brother. Hey, give me that! Hey give me that back! Give me that! Admiring our pet mermaid? Quite stunning, isn't she? Yes, she is. We're all mad, you know? Fancy some tea? Yes, I'd love a cup of tea. - Good morning. - Morning, David. - Hello. - Hope you slept well? As a matter of fact, I didn't. Oh, sorry to hear that. What was the matter, did things go bump in the night. Why did you say that? Oh dear, you do seem a bit edgy this morning. Yes, I am. You see I don't happen to like childish tricks. Tricks? There was a peculiar scratching at my door last night. Rats. One expects them in an old house. Then a tapping began, it got louder and louder. That was me, thumping the rats. I got three last night. Oh, I hate rats. This wasn't rats. When I went to open my door, I was prevented from opening it, because... someone was pulling from the other side. Someone as strong as I am. Must be Nanny's ghost. Poor Nanny, I'll help you. Careful. Oh, David. Do sit down and have your breakfast. No compensation, I promise, no...! Right, it's all right. ...persecution... What would she want from me? Haven't you had enough? Leave me in peace, I beg you. May I come in? Oh, of course, Professor. Are you all right? I was hoping we could have a little talk. Mind if I sit down? Please, sit. Mrs Webb, you asked me to come here, because you expected me to find something. What did you expect me to find? Have you always lived here at Edbrook? Many years. The children were born here. Their father was a diplomat, he was abroad a great deal. Mrs. Mariell went with him. And the children? I looked after them until they were old enough to go to boarding schools... in England. They couldn't wait for the holidays... to get back to Edbrook... to be together again. And where are the parents now? They're both dead. Did they die in the house? No. They... they died in India. Is it the parents, you think, you see? The mother? Or is it the children's father, Mr. Mariell? He was a fine man. God rest his soul. Mrs. Webb... Why don't you tell them that you're still here... and that the children will come to no harm... and that they can leave you in peace. - Christina. - David. I couldn't tell you at breakfast... It might have been Simon, in spite of what he says. He's so bored. Well, I figured it was him at my door last night. But why? Why in Gods name would he want to torment your Nanny like that? Torment her? Christina... She's a disturbed women. She doesn't need me. She needs a doctor. So you don't think we're haunted? Haunted? I'll sleep easier now. Does that mean your leaving? Well, I'd like to stay, to... try and convince your Nanny, that there are no ghosts haunting Edbrook. Good. That means you'll be here for ages. Push me. - Push you? - Push me. - Harder! - Harder? I'll call Dr. Doyle and ask him to stop in. He's known the family for years. Oh, good. Do you mind me asking... what's in the locked room upstairs? My parents bedroom. Nanny Tess likes to keep it a shrine. Harder! I didn't realize you'd be dressing for dinner. Well, normally we don't. Not when it's just us. Well actually we're going out this evening. Is that terribly rude of us? No, no not at all. Long standing engagement. I'm afraid we can't break it. Nanny will look after you, she's an excellent cook. I do hope that you'll.. make yourself at home. I will. I feel really awful about this. Oh please, I have plenty of work to do. Christina. We shall be late. Thank you, why... Please, Professor, sit. Who were you talking to, Mrs. Webb? Are they still here? They'll always be here. Mrs. Webb... I have been to hundreds of houses... and countless seances... and I have never yet seen something that can't be explained in rational terms. The people I have met all have one thing in common. Pain. I thought you came to help me. Mrs. Webb, I'm trying to help. You mean to tell me that you see... nothing? I see nothing. But the point is, you do. And If you just give me a few simple details, I intend to prove to you that there's nothing in Edbrook House to be afraid of. There are spirits in this house. I know you see... Mrs. Webb! Breathe! Just breathe deeply. Are you all right? Just breathe deep. You just sit yourself down here. I have some work to do, but I'm here if you need me, all right? Oh dear God, no... no...! What are you doing? No! Hello. Huh... If I'd known what you intended, I'd have tried to manage a smile for you. Dr. Henry Doyle. Dr Doyle, thank goodness you're here. You can thank goodness if you like, you might also thank Christina. Mrs. Webb is not at all well, her nerves are shattered, I'm afraid. So Christina said. - Where is poor Nanny? - I'll take you to her. Most kind. Tell me, if you don't mind my asking, what do you hope to discover with your wires and flash powder? Poor Nanny's ghost, perhaps? Or someone masquerading as her ghost, yes. I was in mid conversation and she suddenly began convulsing. Grabing at her throat as though someone were choking her. I'd hoped she'd come to grips with this ghost businesses. She used to be such a strong women before Mr and Mrs. Mariell died. You known the family long? Oh, I feel as though I've known them forever. I delivered all the children. Oh, I see. Well I may be doing more harm than good here. A familiar face might help calm her down. Mrs. Webb? Oh no... no... no...! Just leave us alone for a moment, will you? No, please! I'll be all right! Off course you will, Nanny. No! You did quite right to send for me as you did. She's suffering from emotional trauma. I've left her something to help her sleep. Is there anything at all I can do? Try to persuade her that Edbrook is not haunted. I will try. Well, she's resting now. I'd leave her for the moment if I were you. Christina knows where I am if you should need me. Good bye and... I know my way out, thank you. Thank you, doctor. Did I scare you? You... you most certainly did not. I'm sorry, I couldn't resist. You naughty girl. So, perhaps underneath that cynicism, there is just a glimmer of doubt? Well, doubt is healthy. It... It tests ones convictions, don't you think? What did you think you'd find when you opened the door? Someone playing the piano. Who? I didn't know. But you opened it. Your awfully brave. An adventurous spirit. What is it? A rat? No... The shadow moved, it's nothing. You're back early. Yes. It was a boring party. I said I had a headache. The son of the house drove me home. He's got a thumping crush on me. Does that sound conceited. No, not in your case. Oh, that's beautiful. Thank you. It reminds me of my mother. Isn't it funny how music makes memories so vivid? Ye... yes. What the hell was that? - Are you all right? - Yes. I see your working hard, Professor. Did you touch that? Yes, it was flickering so I just turned it up. Well, don't touch the gas in this part of the house, it's very dangerous. Yes, well, somehow I've gathered that. The whole place is a firetrap, you understand. I think its time for bed, Christina, don't you? Morning. How's Mrs. Webb? She's no better. I'll be honest with you, David. I didn't particularly want you to come here. I went along with it because I thought perhaps it might help Nanny. She seems to become much worse. I'm not a healer. You don't believe that Edbrook is haunted, do you? No, I haven't found any evidence of that, so far. So, is there any particular reason why you should stay? David. You were invited into our house to help Nanny. Don't abuse my sisters hospitality, will you? I'll finish my work tonight, and I'll go tomorrow, as planed. Unless, of course, you want me to leave now. Oh, no... No. Tomorrow will be adequate. Good morning. You and Robert looked as you were getting along. Did we? Sleep well? Very well, thank you, and you? Terribly. I dreamt the whole night. Well, what about? You. Catch anything in your traps? No, I'm afraid not, no. Don't look so disappointed, that's good news. Have you told her? No, not yet. Nanny. Nanny, good news. David hasn't found any ghost. It's sad, isn't it? She's so far gone. You know I'll be leaving tomorrow? I have work to get back to. I may not let you go. Oh, stop it. David... would you sign my copy of your book? I'd be delighted. Do you want to borrow my back? Don't... Oh, please don't wriggle. My writing is bad enough as it is. Stop. To the audaciously charming Christina. I shall never forget you. Thank you, David. Simon! Caught you, didn't I? You shouldn't do that. He's impossible. Oh, you're becoming so boring, Christina. We have to do something to liven things up around here. Robert's always glum and Nanny Tess is mad. They're always spying on me. Come on, lets go. Go where? I'd like to spend some time with you without my brothers to bother us. - Well... - Don't argue, I've made up my mind. As this is your last day, then I intend to enjoy it. Why did you come back to England? The irresistible pull of one's roots, I suppose. What? You sound like a vegetable. On behalf of the entire empire, we're honoured to have you. - Hey! - No... err.. no... Lucky heather? No, thank you. Tell your fortune. Sixpence. Go on, then. Huh, you don't believe in that rubbish, do you? Oh, don't be so boring. I want to see what's gonna happen to you. Sixpence? There you are. I will marry soon. You will marry soon. This year. I will have a long and happy life with my wife. You will live long and be happy with your wife. Many children. You will have many children. One, who will be named... after the loved one, you lost as a child. Thank you. It's your turn. There is nothing I can tell you, you do not know. I must be going now. Pardon me. Oh, I didn't like that. Was it true? What she said happened to you as a child? I had a twin sister. And she died when I was very young. I'm sorry. What happened? She drowned. Oh David, I'm so sorry. I was with her when it happened. I suppose I took up psychology because of it... To prove that she was really gone. She'll never really be gone, David. There's magic in our sense of longing. If you take away the magic, you take away the capacity to love. This is my magic place. Is it? My mother adored it. She used to come here every day in summer. I can picture her now... sitting in that chair with a book. It's my clearest memory of her. How old were you when she died? It was the day before my 14th birthday. St Valentine's Day. Year after year, every Valentines day I'd come up here and just... sit... trying to get a sense of her. I couldn't accept that death was so final. It's a difficult thing to accept. Your parents died in India? They were on their way to the hills. The monsoon came early that year. They... just disappeared. Nanny is convinced that mother comes back here every night. She says she once saw her. She says she saw her here? That was the beginning of Nanny's troubles. I'll race you to the house! Where have you been? Out riding. Riding? At night? I'm sorry, Robert. Sorry? You should be sorry. We waited ages for you for supper. I was worried that something might have happened. It wasn't our intention to be this late. You were asked here to help Nanny, you haven't been terribly good at it, have you? Stop it, Robert, it's not David's fault. I'm sure it isn't. Nanny was worried sick. It's terrible to do that to her. Sorry. Your sister is a grown woman. And it was entirely my fault. Good night. David! Let me help you! That's it. Thank God you were there! It's the weeds. I couldn't get out of those weeds! Weeds? What weeds? They were holding me down. Smothering me... Well, there aren't any weeds. They were around my neck. Choking me. And then... suddenly... I was free. That was me! David! David... that was me. Come on, dear chap, let's get you inside. Come on! I came to collect your wet clothes. And your very welcome to them. I'll take them down to the kitchen, they'll be dry by morning. I'm worried about you, David. How did you fall in the lake? Christina... I didn't fall. I was pushed. Pushed? Someone pushed me. Oh, you're you not thinking about what I told you? Mother was a gentle person. She'd never push anybody into the lake. Not your mother, for Gods sake, a person! A person who pushed me. Well, who would do that? Perhaps the same person that's frightening your Nanny. The same person that was scratching at my door that night. - Where was Simon? - Asleep. How did you know I was down at the lake? Oh, you're not accusing me? No. I'm surprised you haven't accused Nanny. Why would any of us want to hurt you? You could have drowned, David. I thought you might be grateful. I am sorry. I am sorry... I am most grateful to you. I'm... just confused. It's all right. I'm sorry I was cross, it must have been horrid for you. I think perhaps you better get this down. It'll kill the taste of the lake. You must be exhausted. Jolly difficult day. A lot happening. You probably need your sleep. Christina? I'm not mad, am I, professor? Take me with you tomorrow. You're my salvation, I beg you! No, no! Let me go! No! No! No... no! - Good morning. - Good morning. When your packed, Simon will help with your bags... Christina will drive you to the station. I'm afraid I'm not leaving. Just as you wish. - Number, please? - Camberley 284, please. Professor Ash's office. Kate, its David. Listen, I need your help. Are you all right? I called round to see you last night. I though you'd be back! Listen, you're going to have to cancel my tutorials tomorrow. I'm going to be a few more days here. David you d... don't sound well. I'm fine. Listen, I need you to do something for me. Will you look up the 'Times' for February 17th, 1923. Page 13, top left hand corner. All right? Yes, I'll do it straight away. I'll call you back later. - All right David, bye. - Okay. Robert! Oh, Robert, please don't! Stop it! Robert! Stop it! - Please! - Go on. Go on. Go on. Go on... This way... Come here... No, that's not it... Messy... Come on.. Come on. Come on over here... It's David. I was right, I knew it was David. Now there's four of us, we can play the Edbrook game. Five, with Nanny Tess. Yes, Nanny can play. Oh come on, Nanny. It is your birthday. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Nanny. Happy birthday to you. Of course she will play. Now... The Edbrook game! It's very simple. - We all put a shilling in the kitty. - One of use goes and hides. Whoever finds it, wins. - And if nobody finds it... - ...then he keeps the kitty. Simple. I'm not a great one for games. Oh, David we need you. Do be such a spoil sport. We're trying to cheer up Nanny. You never know who you might find. David, you hide first. And we'll find you. We'll count to 100. Slowly, though. It's got to be slowly. 1, 2, 3... Go on David, you better hurry. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16... I always look here first. I found you. I win. - Kate? - David? - Have you found it? - I've got it. It's a report of a coroner's inquest. Tragedy at Edbrook Hall. Mr. Anthony Yates, the county coroner... Quickly, Kate. Just tell me what happened. Apparently, Mrs. Mariell drowned herself in the lake. They brought in a verdict of suicide, while the balance of her mind was disturbed. David? Thank you, Kate. What's the matter, David? What's the matter? I don't know who or what to believe, anymore. That's what's the matter. I'm worried about you. Oh, yes? Well, I'm worried about me, as well. I don't know if I'm imagining things. I don't know if your Nanny's mad. Am I now seeing what she sees? I don't trust anyone or anything in this house. You can trust me. Oh, really? Can I? Does this date mean anything to you? Oh, David... Why did you lie to me? We invented her dying in India, because... we couldn't bare the truth. Why did your mother commit suicide? After father died, she became terribly depressed. Coming home to Edbrook only made it worse. So many memories... Miss her so much. Who found the body? She's dead. That's enough, isn't it? Now you know our dirty little secret. Do you have to ask all these questions? Yes, I'm afraid I do. So you want to know what the body looked like, do you? How her lips were blue... how her skin was bloated and cracked, her eyes frozen open. You're fascinated by the dead, it's ghoulish. You should see a doctor, David. Nanny Tess found her. She's never been the same. Are you satisfied? Christina? Mrs. Webb? Help! Christina! Christina! Help! Christina, help! The whole place is on fire, I could not get out! David, stop it! - The cellar's on fire! - What fire? The cellar! Come on! Christina! David, there's no fire. You can see there's no fire. I don't understand... what's happening to me? There was a fire. David, you're imagining things. Come, David. They'll take you. I'll be waiting in the car. The things you've described you've seen... are symptomatic of somebody who is suffering from great emotional distress. The experience in the lake, the fire. Is this the first time that you've experienced these illusions? Did you fight in the war, David? Argonnes, Sedan. But you survived. Yes, I survived. And your sister, you survived her to. Yes, Christina told me. She drowned. That's right. You blame yourself? It was my fault. I pushed her. And then I wasn't able to save her. You know, I find it fascinating... that you've devoted your life to disproving spiritual phenomena. Belief in the afterlife helps us mourn, helps us heal. You can't allow yourself the benefits of faith. You feel you don't know how to explain anything, do you? You know, I've known strong men, men who've survived war... Destroyed by their own guilt. My guilt does not explain what is happening at Edbrook House. Nanny Tessis' symptoms are very similar to yours, you know. She can't accept the fact that she's survived people she's served all her life. You agreed with my diagnosis of her. You're alone, no family. Not able to come to terms with many of your experiences. The minds a very fragile thing, you know, David. Christina tells me you are not sleeping. Here. Here, try taking one of these if you can't sleep. It may help you. Thank you, you've been very helpful. Well, good bye, David. And good luck to you. And always remember I am here if you want someone to talk to. I thank you. And if you must have an obsession... remember, Christina's a healthy one. Yes, she is. Bye. Are you all right? I'm fine. David? Are you sorry you came here? Oh, no... I don't ever want to loose you. You don't have to. I want you to leave with me tomorrow. I can't. I can't leave Edbrook. Why? Robert would never let me. Robert? This has nothing to do with Robert. No, it hasn't. Sleep, David. Christina? Christina? Christina! Dr Doyle? Dr. Doyle? Dr. Doyle? There is no Dr. Doyle, David. He died here many years ago. Juliet? Is that you? Let me take you. No, no this can't be. Take my hand, be safe with me. David! David. Don't go to her, David. David! Are you all right? I was so worried about you. I'm here, David. Be with me. Give yourself to me. Don't stop yourself. Get in the car. I'll never leave you, David. We'll be together forever. Is that what you want? Christina! Watch out! Christina's dead. Of course she is. Forgive me. I should never have asked you here. They'll never let us go. I want to know what's happened here. And I want to know right now. One day, Mrs. Mariell came home unexpectedly. She went upstairs to find the children. They were in her bedroom. Simon was drunk. Robert and Christina were... she told me what she saw. She couldn't face the horror of it. And that day, she drowned herself in the lake. And then what happened, Nanny? Go on. It was you. You were born evil. Who's evil? I never murdered anyone. You corrupted the others. You locked us in the bedroom, you set fire to it. They... they deserved to die. She killed us, you see. She thought she'd be rid of us. Well, now I'm afraid we don't need you anymore, Nanny. You don't. No... No... No! I wonder how I could have gone so long without you. Do you feel the same way? That must be what love is, David. Making a sacrifice for another person. Facing eternity with them. I'm so happy to have found you. Stay, we'll be together. Sleep well, David. You've been terrific fun, David. You had your chance to leave, David. Die for me, David! I'll never forgive myself for what happened to you. It wasn't your fault, David. It was an accident. We would have been so close. And we always will be. Goodbye, David. David, welcome home. Did you scare all the ghosts away? Most of them.
