I've seen someamazing places. Still, it's not exactlywhat I saw myself doing when I started out. What do you mean? Well, you know whenI began my career I wanted to be thenext Diane Arbus. Who's that? A greatphotographer. She did these hauntingportraits of misfits and outsiders. You know Diane Arbus's work? Yeah, contraryto appearances, I'm not a completeidiot. No one said you were. I like a lotof photographers. I like Adams, Edward Weston, I love Mary Ellen Mark. Oh, I'm surprised. Yeah well, I'm a man ofmany surprises. Whatever. Wow this is so cool. It's a Leica. Can you take a pictureof me and my dad? Sure. Can I have anice face please? One more. That's a nice one. Oh, oh! Wow, I didn't know I couldget reception out here. Wow, I'm surprised. Hello? Lorenzo... hello... Hello? Damn I lost the signal again. Can you back up? I'd really rather not. Oh look this couldbe important. It'll just takea second, please. I don't thinkthat's a good idea. Please? Okay, but just for a minute. We're really takingour chances here. Okay, I'll be quick, I'lljust find the signal. No bars, no bars. oh, one bar, Go that way, that way, no bars again, wait, onebar, one bar, a little more, little more, ohI got two bars... I got nothing, I gotnothing, I got nothing. Oh god, I got nothing! Will you stopyelling at me? What are you doing? I'm trying to findyou reception. You're doing a terrible job. Do you want to drive? Oh no!What's wrong? We're stuck.

Will you two stop it? Okay, so what do we do? Well, we don't havea lot of options. We can stay here and wait forsomeone to give us a tow... We haven't seen anothercar on the road in the last two hours. Or we can walk out. Oh, you've got to be kidding. You got a better idea? What about helicopter rescue? Are you crazy? What about the Mounties? I think they're in Canada. Well, is that far away? Hello? Okay forget aboutthe Mounties, why don't we send up a flare? What good would that do? It might attractthe attention of a St. Bernardor something. What, do you think there'sarmies of St. Bernards roaming themountainsides waiting to rescuestranded motorists? Okay forget aboutthe St. Bernard. You're Grizzly Adams,you think of something. Why would you call me that? I am nothing likeGrizzly Adams. Okay forget it. I'm sorry I said anything. I just find it hard tobelieve that this is the only option for us,to walk out. Think of it as one oflife's little adventures. We're in themiddle of nowhere. Actually,that's not true. My mom's place is just10 miles up the road. If we start walking now wecan probably make it before nightfall. Walk? We'll freeze todeath. I've got an extra pair oflong johns here in my bag. Oh, you're not Grizzly Adams? Got to be preparedfor all possibilities. I have never metanyone who carried a second setof long johns. You never met my dad. Here, I hope they fit. Where do I change? Jack ass. Take this too, here. Is everybody ready? Yup. Let's go. Mush! What? Is that what you say? That's witha dog sled. Oh, well what do yousay when you're hiking?

Mack got here about daybreakso they got an early start. He'll be back soon. Oh no, no, let me do that. You relax. Thanks. Do you mind if I take awalk around your place? Well there's not muchto see, but be myguest. Hi. What are youdoing in here? Oh, I was just looking around. I'm sorry. You're mother didn't tell methat this was off limits or... It's not, I guess. Who did these? They're amazing. I did. Are you serious? I didn't know youwere an artist. I'm not anymore. These were all donea long time ago. Why are they here? They're brilliant. They should be exhibited. They were. Now I know why theseseem so familiar. I've seen these,didn't I, years ago at theContemporaryin Chicago? Yeah. Well what happened?Why did you stop? Life intervened. After Angie... after my wife died, I just couldn'tsee the point. And there was Hilly. That's right. Why? Because they're beautiful. You gonna watch TV all day? Sure. Why don't you gooutside and play? I was outside allday yesterday. There are poorkids in the world who'd givetheir eye teeth to be in thecountry for Christmas. They can have it. Besides I'm getting tiredof hearing about gangsters, rappers, cribs. The least you could do isput on the food network. Yuck. Or better yet go and find outwhat you're dad is up to. We need a few thingsfrom the store. This one's my favorite. Want to know why? I was midwayinto the piece when I discovered thisflaw in the metal. See it, here? Oh yeah, I neverwouldhave noticed that. It's subtle, but completely at oddswith my original design and I almostabandoned the piece. But then the more Iconsidered thisimperfection, the more it seemedlike a gift so I followed it to see where itwanted me to go and, I know itsounds strange, but it's as if thispiece of metal revealed itself to me. I don't think it'sso strange at all. No? No. What'sgoing on? I was just talking toClaire about this piece. Oh, okay. Yeah, he was just talkingto me about the piece. Cool. Grandma said she neededsome stuff from the store. Okay. I think shemeans like now. Tell her to hold herhorses,I'll be there in aminute. You tell her. I'm going to go play inthe clean country air for all the poorkids who can't. Guess I'm goingto the store. I guess so. This is sucha good idea. I've never donethis before. It's justpopcorn. But it's so festive. Oh we don't doit to be festive. We do it becausewe're broke. You didn't tell meher dad was an artist. You didn't ask,besideshe's not anymore. He's a teacher. You like himdon't you? Yeah I think he'sa really nice man. No, I mean you like him. I'm not sure whatyou're getting at. No big deal. He likes you too. He does?How do you know that? Are you kidding? He acts like a totalspaz around you. Well that's very niceand I'm flattered, but I'm about to getmarried to someone else. He could be the wrong guy. You never know. Just heard some good news.
