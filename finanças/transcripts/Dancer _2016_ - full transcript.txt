- [breathing deeply] [instrumental music] II [music swelling] II [gentle harp music] [orchestra warming up] [indistinct chatter] It's for my heart. This for energy. I always perform on it. Always leave a little bit for second act. - [over intercom] Attention, dancers. The show will begin in 20 minutes. - I heard it was, like, some of it was made for US. army. It's like, I won't even remember performance. It's like crazy kick in. Nurofen. 20 minutes. [steady drumbeat] II In a bit, I will get so high. [electronic guitar music] - ♪ I am Iron Mani - That's it. Let's go. II [indistinct chatter] - [over intercom] All patrons." please take your seats. The orchestra is ready. And so are the artists. The show will begin shortly. II [cheers and applause] II - May I have your autograph? - Of course. - Why do you need his autograph? All you need is for him to look into your eyes. [laughter] - Sergei Polunin's athleticism, artistry, and temperament have drawn comparisons with Rudolf Nureyev. - Girls, let us through, please! - Mama, I want a photo with him! [cameras clicking] - The 23-year-old Ukrainian-born dancer is regularly hailed as the greatest of his generation but also one of the most unpredictable. - I Has he lost his mind I I Can he see or is he blind I - He has the elevation, the jump, the spins. It's almost too good to be true. - His walk is arrogance. He's a god. You cannot keep your eyes off him. II - I Is he alive or dead I I Has he thoughts within his head I I We'll just... I - Dancers have to be tough, and they have to understand every time they go out, they've got to be excellent. - They become so immersed and so concentrated in trying to get the success that that means ifs a detriment to every other thing that they do in their life. II - Polunin has spoken frankly in the past about recreational drugs, depression, his often strained artistic relationships. Oh, and he doesn't turn up for interviews. [tattoo machine buzzing] II - The audience were shocked. Why is he not happy? What can we do to make him happy? And he's like, "Well, nothing." He pushed and pushed and pushed, and that's why at the end, he just exploded. II [boat horn blows] [bell clangs] [engine rumbling] [seagulls calling] - {grew up in Kherson. It's the southern of Ukraine. Everybody was poor. You know, nobody had money. And when everybody's poor, you don? fee! the difference. And when you're a kid, especially. You're just having fun. You don'? know any troubles. [soft piano music] - When Sergei was born, I remember the maternity nurse came to check for defects in the joints. She spread his legs apart the normal amount, but they just kept spreading apart. The nurse got scared. She wasn't expecting that. He was flexible from birth. - I remember I didn't enjoy school. I didn't enjoy sitting at the desk. So I loved gymnastics. - In Kherson, the situation was not very promising. I was always thinking about his future. - And now for the third-place award. Sergei Polunin. [applause] - Boys first have to do gymnastics. Then the trainer says What's next. Ballet or more gymnastics. I knew it had to be ballet. I just had this gut feeling that this was the right decision, and it was. II - {love ballet and f took as gymnastics. You know, I was like, “S want to be the best.“ And I didn't know Where it will take me. [applause] - He was Mile, playful. He didn't yet understand Why he was here. He was long, flexible, strong. But he had a problem. We had to redo his muscles. He had the muscles of a gymnast, and for ballet, they need to be long, classical-looking. - Galina lvanovna was the one that made him fall in love with dancing. Watching his shows at the school... I remember I had tears in my eyes when my little crumb came out onstage and began to improvise a ballet. [man singing operatically] II - I did have a happy childhood, you know? My mom mainly raised me, bull loved spending time with my dad. [applause] - In Kherson, We spent a lot of time together. We enjoyed the outdoors, went to the beach, wrestled, and fooled around. I refused to believe we were going to be separated. II [classical piano music] II - When l dance, I don't think how I dance. H's who I am. II Ballet is just putting the restriction on the dancing, like some directions to it. But I dance just how I- you know, how I feel, how my body moves. II And when you take off and you hover in the air and your body lets you do that, you know, those couple of seconds, it's worth, like, dancing for. [bouncy piano music] II [majestic orchestral music] II [applause] [cheers and applause] [soft instrumental music] II - I Wanted him to accomplish something... So that he could live a better life than We did. The choreographic school in Kiev was the best school in the Ukraine. But to study in that school, it was impossible, because H was very expensive. [indistinct chatter] - Turns out Dad is the breadwinner, and to enable Sergei to go to the school in Kiev, Grandma and I drew straws to decide who would go where. Grandma left for Greece, and I left for Portugal. Galina stayed with Sergei. - Vlad went in one direction and you the other. - Yes. - That enabled them to pay Sergei's tuition. II - When I was nine years old, my grandma went to work to Greece. My dad went to work to Portugal to support me. And me and my mom went to Kiev. That's when, I guess, fun was over. - Assemble and then relevé. Can you do it, or are you scared? - I'm not scared. - Well, then! - It's okay if it's not right at first. Just practice! - My life in Kiev was ballet class in the morning, some academics, and then ballet in the evening. - Sergei, what was that? Don't try too hard! You should be natural. - At home, my mom would make me stretch, and I would sit in a split for hours, watching TV. I think she was angry with her parents, that they didn't push her, so she makes sure she pushed me enough, you know, that I don't have that regret. II - AH I had were his problems, his school, his practices... Do it again! His homework, tailoring for him. I had no life of my own in Kiev. - Higher! See, that's it! I'm hardly holding him! That's it! - I did feel a lot of pressure when I was in Kiev because my family moved around the World to support me. I really did. - In Portugal, {met some Germans, and I worked as their gardener. All the money I earned, I sent to Galina. - I Worked taking care of an aged grandmother. It was so difficult, morally and physically. I felt so sorry for myself. [laughs] - We clearly had a team. And this little boy was our hope. - Sergei was accepted into the Kiev Choreographic School. In the same year, he won second piece at the National Ballet Competition. Sergei, what are you passionate about? - I have a lot of passions, but my favorite is dancing. I want my dancing to give people joy. I want my figure to be more beautiful. To get skinnier so that it's pleasant to took at me. To be the best so that I am remembered. [dramatic rock music] II - After a couple of years in that school, he was already the best student in his class. But I Wanted to make sure he could reach the top. II I then realized that it would be much better for him to study abroad. II I took photos, made a video, and mailed it all. We got the invitation for an audition. So we went. [upbeat music] II - Ladies and gentlemen, We have started our descent and will shortly be landing at London Heathrow. II - London was very different from Ukraine. Everything was beautiful and magical. - Sergei took out the camera and filmed. We laughed a lot! - We spent long time to find the school because ifs in the middle of the park. Mom, are you filming the deer? H was deers outside, parrots. School looked like a painting. It felt like I was in a "Harry Potter" World. - When We arrived at the Royal School, there were a lot of children. He auditioned, then a teacher came out and said to expect the results that Monday. A whole week passed by, and we stopped waiting. Serezha is ready to eat. But then we received a letter saying, "We're happy to accept you to the Royal Ballet Academy." And I remember being so happy to hear that he got in. But... Complications began with my visa. I could have stayed illegally, but H would have compromised the status of Sergei's documents. I didn't want 10 risk H. [somber piano music] - Being far away, you lose familiarity with each other. When Sergei went to London, I didn't see him for six years. - Our family practically separated by itself. Everybody parted like ships at sea. - He didn't know a Word in English. It was really hard to let him go, to say good-bye. [sniffles] That was my ultimate sacrifice. [crying] I didn't know what to do without him. After he was gone, I couldn't put myself together for a Whole year. II - Whose camera is that? - Mine. - Is it? - Yeah! - Serious? - Yeah. [laughter] [bell tolling] [laid-back guitar music] - I Where do we go, nobody knows I II I I've got to say I'm on my way down I II I God, give me style and give me grace I II I God, put a smile upon my face I II - The Royal Ballet school is really good at picking kids. Like, thousands of kids turn up to audition for 13, 14 places. So they know exactly what they're looking for. And Sergei, you could just see it in abundance. He just had so much, you know, raw talent. - He was always Way ahead than everybody. I used to call him the... the graceful beast or something like this. Because he's sort of like a lion, you know, the way he tackles a step. But then as soon as the step is airborne, it's just so in control and clean and pure, which is a really rare mix. II He was always in the studio right until the school closed. He was really dedicated. - I would do ballet class twice more than normal kids because I knew that's my chance to get my family back together. And I knew if Pm gonna mess it up, they're gonna just send me home. - Sergei, is that one of our T-shirts'? - No! - Oh, Sergei! [indistinct chatter] [lively piano music] II - His dancing standard was so high, they bumped Sergei up three years. II - You can tell he was the best. You can tell he was gonna be famous. You can tell he's going to do the best he can. And you can tell he's gonna be over every single one, you know, in the class, and he did. [dramatic piano music] II [dramatic orchestral music] II - First year, he was learning parts that corps de ballet don't Seam. In his second year, he was {earning soloist and principal parts, which never happens. He was inspirational to watch. II [applause] - The school, of course, was very aware of his talent, and they pushed him in Whichever Way possible. But we had a lot of fun when we were in school. I mean, we got in a lot of trouble. - Sal is smoking. He's so bad. - Oh, shut up! [laughter] Get it off, you twat! - It's for my mum. [laughter] Jade is smoking. I'm smoking, but not really. We need more shots. - No, no more shots. - Yeah. Definitely. I'm not- I'm sober. [laughter] - [whispering] This is a pen, and that's Sergei. And we're gonna draw on his face. Okay? Okay. [Upbeat pop music] II - Sergei used to arrive at parties and drink a stupid amount of alcohol for the first 20 minutes, party really hard for ten minutes, and then knockout deed. And I mean knockout deed. Like, just knocked out, you know. No nothing. Unconscious. So people started to... First of all, it was toothpaste. Then H was drawing. - I Like a shotgun needs an outcome I - Then we actually once- and I'm guilty of that- we shaved one of his eyebrow. And that was a week before his big competition. And he won the competition, the Grand Prix. And that's Why there is actually this famous picture- Not many people would notice because it's very slight. But there is a picture of him, like, getting a medal, and if you actually look close, you can see slightly here, he still didn't quite grow back. [laughs] So... I mean, we understand that it was a dangerous thing to do because we had the blade close to his eyes, but we know that when he's out, he's out. - Sergei. Wake up. - Fuck off. - Come on. - Will! - What do you mean Will? I'm Jade. Sergei, come on. - I Got you around my finger I - Sergei. He's a knob. - I Like a lonely lover's charm I - Serezha. - Sergei, I think he's always suffered silently. We sort of cheered each other up. We never really wanted to bring each other down by talking about, like, whatever our families were going through. - I do remember when we did talk about his family, he always made it seem like there was a family. And then I guess when we became friends, when we became closer friends and you find out more about each other, it became clear that they were separate. [somber music] II - After Sergei's first year there, the divorce happened. - When my mom told me that they are divorcing... I was in dormitories for kids, and I was probably 15. And I remember there was, like, kids at the back, and somebody was, like, teasing me or something, and I was just like, "What the..." But... So I guess I was more angry with my mom because she was the one. - Sergei called me in Portugal and, with a certain pity toward me, started asking, "How are you? How are things going?" I couldn't tell him about it. Then I found out that he already knew. [indistinct chatter] - One of the most important things is family. And by doing ballet, I hoped I would bring them more and more together, but I wasn't able to bring them together. I Wasn't able to make everything fine and good. There was- You know, I was so upset that I was like, "I'm never gonna be upset again "and I never will feel sorry for anybody. "I will never miss anybody, and I don't want any memories about anything." II And that was last time I cried for years. [dramatic orchestral music] II - From day one, you cannot give him anything at all except principal. And he was a soloist because that's the way it works. But then he was too big for a soloist. II For him, it's more a role like a bronze idol. You know, people used to look at him and not look at the principal. You know, he was too big. II [cheers and applause] And that's why they gave it to him as a principal. - The fastest that's come through the company. The youngest principal the Royal Ballet's ever seen. Because he was that good, and you could see it. [rock music] - I Having trouble telling I I How I feel but I I I Can dance, dance, dance I I Couldn't possibly tell you I I How I mean but I I I Can dance, dance, dance I I So when I trip on my feet I I Look at the beat, the words are I I Written in the sand I I When I'm shaking my hips... I - That's What everyone Worked for every day at the Royal Ballet School was to be in the Royal Ballet Company and to be a famous principal there. II - I I was a dancer all along I - Whoa. - I Dance, dance, dance I I Words can never make up for what you do I - He was amazing because there is rules and regulations in the ballet. H's choreography, you know. You have to do it a certain way. For him, if you go and see him Monday and you went to see him on a Wednesday, he didn't do the same thing. He will do something different in it. He will follow the rules of the ballet, but he will put something that belongs to him in it. - I I was a dancer all along I - And, you know, the audience flock there. - People book their tickets to see him perform two years into the future. - I Words can never make up for what you do I - That's incredible. - I Dance, dance, dance I - He was performing so Well, but he was really reluctant to dance in front of his mom and his dad. And the Whole time he was in the Royal Ballet, his family never saw him, which, you know, it's really weird. [somber music] - My mother was very demanding when I was a kid, sol promised myself never Set her watch me because I was angry. - l asked Sergei, and he said, "Please don't come. I get really stressed out when you watch me dance." - It was hard for me to get a visa, being from the former Soviet Union. - So we never went. [cameras clicking] - After his parents divorced, Sergei's motivation changed and he felt like, you know, "What's the reason for me dancing? What's the reason for me pushing this hard?“ [cheers and applause] I think, Whenever you have a goal and there's no reason behind your goal, with anyone, it's gonna end badly. [rock music] II - The life of a principal dancer in a company like the Royal Ballet is famously tough. Their lifestyle needs to be one of self-control or even abstinence. - Sometimes he didn't come to class for three or four days, you know. And the day before, he will say, "Oh, what's on tonight?" And I will say, "Oh, Nutcracker.“ "Oh, yeah." - You've admitted in the past that you danced on drugs or after taking cocaine, and you claimed you dance better. - When you take some painkiller or cocaine, you don't feel pain, so you enjoy yourself. - And you're talking as if that was in the past. You don't dance with the aid of drugs anymore? - Uh... [laughs] [cheers and applause] - There was discussion of partying at clubs, his skipping of rehearsals, and purchasing a tattoo salon. [tattoo machine buzzing] - When f found out Sergei had eight tattoos, I almost lost consciousness, honestly. [cheers and applause] - Polunin said that, “I don't have enough friends and parties, and sometimes such things are important." - He's often used Twitter to talk about nights out. “Party time. Probably no point in going to sheep tonight.“ "Just Woke up at 4:30 sideways, and the lights are still on." - I didn't know about his tweets. Only when the bad press started, then I saw what he was doing. - He was on the phone with "Daily Mail." He was on the phone with the “Times? He was so controversial. The media propelled him to stardom in a way. II - The company pushed him to the max. Rehearsals until 7:00 in the evening and then a show and finish at 10.00. - You haven't got time to do anything else, really. - Every now and again, you'll have one or two dancers who are in everything. And so they feel- they get exhausted. - I think, from there, things started to slowly crumble in his head. - I told them, you know, like, I want some help, you know? - He was thinking, like, "Okay, what's next?" But there was nothing next. [cheers and applause] - The applause and people Waiting for him at the stage door. Everybody adore him. Letters coming up. That kind of thing that you get. It was a kind of substitute for what he couldn't get because he was away from home. - He told me, "Don't worry. Everythings good." Well, it wasn't good. But that's what he said. - He was clearly missing his family. That was our mistake. [seagulls calling] - That morning, he Went in to work and he came back halfway through the day. And it was... I think it was one of them things where he was fighting with himself. "Do I want to do this or not?" - I woke up; it was everything fine. The rehearsal didn't go well. And then I sat down and I just made the decision. [dramatic music] - Now, he was the Royal Ballet's youngest-ever male principal dancer, but yesterday, 22-year-old Sergei Polunin suddenly walked out of his job amid claims that life in the company was too restrictive. - We were having a Chinese meal in Chinatown, and I was facing a television. And we were just eating, and I said, "Oh, you're on television." And he said, "What?" - Now the Royal Ballet has been rocked by the departure of its youngest-ever principal male dancer. - Sergei Polunin, a Ukrainian, shocked the dance world in January... - Ukrainian-born dancer Sergei Polunin was given the name "the bad boy of ballet" after his scandalous departure from the Royal Ballet of London. - For a 22-year-old dancer who's done so much for us, who has so much promise, to leave us at this point is shocking. [melancholy music] - I Will you let me out of here I I Will you let me out I I Will you let me... I - He really was just going through a lot. And people were expecting him to make statements, to make interviews, to express his feelings of why he left. I think the press forgets that he's still in his 20s. - I Oh, it's been so long I I Will you let me out of here I - Principal at the Royal Ballet. - No, principal- principal at question mark, no? - Exactly. - Hey. - Still can't take off his shoes. - [laughs] Sergei, don't take your socks off! Oh, wow. - When he came home, I could see the relief on his face. - Wait, wait, wait. - I'm gonna take- I'm gonna lie down in the snow. You have to take a picture of me just lying down there. - It was the first time in his life he was finally free. [laughter] II - Ahh! [laughter] II - Sergei. - Thanks. And I wanted to dance but not in London. - Oh, shit. - I Wanted always to go to America after Royal Ballet, but nobody would accept me. And they didn't- I guess they didn't want to risk it. And they thought I was crazy, you know. II So I had to go to Russia... Which Wasn't in my plans. [dramatic musical flourish] [cheers and applause] - Ladies and gentlemen... - And those watching at home... - We are excited to bring you our newest show... both: "Big Ballet"! [cheers and applause] - Our first contestant is Sergei Polunin. Sergei recently left London for Moscow. - Did you know Sergei is a real star in London? The papers are constantly writing about him! From London to Moscow especially for this show, Sergei Polunin. [applause] [dramatic orchestral music] II [cheers and applause] - Vladimir, your verdict, please. - Ten. - Thank you. Azzari? - Ten. - Thank you. - Ten. - Thank you! [cheers and applause] Vladymir? - Ten. - A perfect performance! - When Sergei got to Russia, he didn't get the value he deserved from being a principal at the Royal Ballet. - I see scars on your body. These scars are not real, so what are they for? - They are tattoos. - I get that. But Why'd you get so many? - Um... - What's this say? - "Dirty Money." - Why? - I like the song. - Whose song is it? - P. Diddy. - He should have been a mega star, and instead he was on a TV show trying to prove himself to the Russian audience. That's one of the hardest audiences to prove yourself to in the ballet world. - Recently, Sergei Won the "Big Ballet" competition, becoming a name in his new homeland. [laid-back music] II - And in Russia, there was Igor Zelensky, who wasn't scared, you know, and who I believed in and who believed in me. - Sergei is loved by the people. He has so much going for him as a dancer- his jump, his charisma, his physique. In our modern-day ballet, he is exceptional. - I You say you don't belong I - Igor showed up at just the right time. {always wanted Sergei to have a person who was older because he responds to authority. And in that area, Igor is really capable. - Igor is one of the most famous dancers in Russia. If Igor is your friend, you can be a superstar, and that's how much power he has. II - I I know what comfort you are I - West and East, they are two separate Worlds. So when I went to Russia, I had to build my name from beginning. - I Comfort you are I II - Igor was a father figure. I think that was an easy part for Sergei to accept after his father was away and his family was broken. - f was watching TV, and in a show, they said that lgor Zelensky had replaced me. I was hurt. Because until he was nine, I was always with him. - I think Sergei thought when you go away that you're gonna have some exciting experience. And I guess, when he went to Russia, a lot of it was at the beginning. - The romance between Polunin and Russia has lasted for over one and a half years. After the Moscow premiere of "Paquita, " the standing ovation lasts for ten minutes. The dancers once again go out to bow. - Are you serious? - This is it. - They won't clap anymore after this. [cheers and applause] - I I know what comfort you are I II - For first two years in Russia, everything was new. New ballets, classical ballets I never did. But yeah, after a while, {felt the same as in London. H was getting very repetitive. II - Russia didn't give him What he Wanted. Instead of a step up was, you know, a side step. - I I know what comfort you are I I I know what comfort you are I "SERGEI POLUNIN AND IGOR ZELENSKY IN SPARTACUS" [man singing operatically] II [orchestra warming up] - Polina. Could you cover me up, please? - Of course. - F hated the fact that f had to dance and you have to do H. Don't, the costume will cover it. Don't! - Okay. - It's like, Why do you have to do anything? You know? Because you're good at it. [dramatic orchestral music] II [applause] [melancholy orchestral music] II Every time I dance and I get tired, I'm just like, “Why am I doing this,“ you know? I cannot skip a day because Pm in too much pain. And if I skip a day, and I'm like- my shoulders get stuck and my back starts to hurt. So you-you feel like a prisoner to the... to your body, to the urge to dance. Polina, where's the water? - Over there. - Where's there? Why's it there? All right, go. Go get the water. [labored breathing] [frenzied orchestral music] II [cheers and applause] - [groans] So tired. - Do you need help with something? - No, thanks. - Beliefs tedious. And ifs deteriorating. Ballet requires a lot of motivation and discipline. And I think he lost that. - Hang in there, Sergei. - Thanks. - You finish your training, you're 19 years old. You started when you were, like, four or five. And the time it's finished and the time you've got a second to, like, step back and look at your life, your whole entire Childhood's gone. You can't really do anything else because you might get injured. And you put so much time and effort, the time you get to the end, you think, "You know what? "I'm gonna have to go and, you know, be a professional dancer." - Ballet takes a lot of energy from you, and it's... You're getting skinny. Like, your body's, like- You have no energy. You have no fresh thoughts. Then getting my own, like, demons in a way. You know, when I don't see the way forward. [applause] [indistinct chatter] Millions of people, millions of opinions. And when people tell me, like, “Oh, you should do it that way,“ it's like, "Why do/ have to listen to you?" - We'd Skype- And I was like, you know, "What do you do?" And he was like, "I just sit in my apartment on my own.“ - How nice that the laces are only dyed on one side. [tense music] II ls there water over there? - Where you left it. Will you have time in between to drink? I'll go refill and put it to the side for when I won't have time. Before they kill you. - It's too late. II Every time I go onstage, ifs a fight with your own emotions, with tiredness, anger, frustration. [coughing] - I was trying to help him do what he wanted. Because ballet is a young persons business. It's important not to waste time. II - I didn't choose ballet. H was my mom's choice. And I always hoped I will get injured so I Wouldn't have an option to dance anymore. II [train horn blows] - Tea. Tea. - Tea? Sure. Come on in. [cat meows] - What did you say to the cat? - Nothing. - Food was not promised. Well, that was a pretty serious decision. Because I didn't see any prospects for you in Kherson. I didn't see any at all. You remember, don't you, that I always sat at gymnastics and waited for you? It wasn't because I liked being there. I had no money to take the trolley back home. On the other hand, I saw prospects for you in Kiev. Of course, I didn't know anything about ballet. I didn't understand anything about it. But I saw that it made sense to move to Kiev. And I thought, "We'll move, then figure out the rest." We had to spend so much money... the apartment, your education. Everything was very expensive. That's why I was so strict. That's why I expected a lot from you. - But I wanted to achieve things by myself. You didn't trust me. But I knew I could do it myself. - What do you mean I didn't trust you? I controlled you. - Well, controlling me is not trusting me. - Actually, it's belief in you. - Well, it was very stressful for me that Dad and Grandma left. - Well, that's life. There's always responsibility. One can't be without any responsibility to anyone. Every person must be responsible for something. - Galina did everything systematically. She always knew where to go. Where to drive to, where to arrive at, with whom to practice. Sergei got lucky with a mom like that. [melancholy music] II - Hello. - Galina lvanovna! Galina lvanovna! Hello. - [laughs] Galina. Hello. It's great to see you. - My sunshine! - This is for you. Everythings new here. - You used to perform on this stage. Remember? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember. [indistinct chatter] II - Remember What you used to dance to? - Pavarotti, yes! Pavarotti, I danced everywhere. - For you, it's like a talisman. - Well, yeah. As a matter of fact, it is. My first show in Kiev was Pavarotti. - Do you remember what you called him? I asked, "What music do you want for your improv?" You said, "What I had the previous lesson." I said, "Well, I don't remember. Maybe you remember what disc?" And you said, "The one with some dude with a beard on it!" [laughter] That's what you were like. [man singing operatically] II - Let's go get Galina lvanovna! II - [laughs] II [applause] - Children, come over! [indistinct chatter] [laughter] [scattered applause] [melancholy music] II - When Sergei was young, he loved to dance. He danced with his very soul and transported himself right into the music. II - We were meant to go on holiday to Spain and we were about to go to Spain, and he was like, “Dude, we can? go.“ And I was really pissed off, and I was like, “Oh, man, I've been Waiting all summer." And he said, “5 need some help "And, you know, a friend to just hang outwith and, you know..." And yeah, of course I'm gonna come. Yeah. - I want to do, like, a different style from classical style. Um... I want to have a lot of dancing but a lot of emotions too. So it's gonna be... - He told me, "/ don't Want to do this anymore, and I would like you to choreograph my {est dance.“ And I didn't say anything to him. He's old enough now to make his own decisions. I didn't try and, like, fight him on it, like I used to. What's the music? - The music is "Take Me To Church." It's amazing song. - All right, well, as soon as I listen to the music and feel the vibe, and then we can try and build some type of, like, story line to it. [soft piano music] II Being his best friend, being one of the closest people to him, I can't say I was surprised because I guess I knew it was coming. But the fact that he can just stop it all, I think it would- I think it would crush a lot of people. II As soon as you catch heaven... Barn, barn. II Barn, barn, barn. I'm trying to tell a story to Sergei's fans. I didn't want to make everything too obvious, but I definitely know that when people see the piece, the fact that he worked so hard, problems that he's had, they'll get it straightaway, and if this is his last dance, I think it's a great dance. II - So what time do you think you're gonna be doing this? - Tomorrow around 9:00. - So "Take Me To Church," it's not a music video, you know? So it's the opposite. It's just, like, you know, really showing off Sergei's artistry, his physicality, his height of his jumps. This is kind of a key. So what we should do, Jade- or maybe we should do a quick run-through, even if we don't do all the jumps right now. I don't know if you're warmed up or not. So you could just say, "Okay, big jump," and you can just kind of walk it through. - Earlier. - Right now, we've got a 5:40 a.m. call, so you want to start at 3:45? - Tomorrow? Are we shooting at another location? [voices fading] [somber music] II - Watch your head. - Okay, that's good. Good, good. [indistinct chatter] [smoke whooshing] - Can you get me a flathead, Danny? II - I did everything dance I Wanted to do. And I just Want to get a normal life now. - Okay, roll music. [waves crashing] [melancholy music] II - I My lover's got humor I I She's the giggle at a funeral I I Knows everybody's disapproval I I I should've worshipped her sooner I If the heavens ever did speak I I She's the last true mouthpiece I I Every Sunday's getting more bleak I I A fresh poison each week I I We were born sick I I You heard them say it I I My church offers no absolutes I I She tells me, worship in the bedroom I I The only heaven I'll be sent to I I ls when I'm alone with you I I I was born sick I I But I love it I I Command me to be we“ I Hey I Amen I I Amen I I Amen I I Take me to church I I I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies I I I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife I I Offer me that deathless death I I Good God, let me give you my life I I Take me to church I I I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies I I I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife I I Offer me that deathless death I I Good God, let me give you my life I II I If I'm a pagan of the good times I I My lover's the sunlight I I To keep the goddess on my side I I She demands a sacrifice I I Drain the whole sea I I Get something shiny I I Something meaty for the main course I I That's a fine-looking high horse I I What you got in the stable I I We've a lot of starving faithful I I That looks tasty I I That looks plenty I I This is hungry work I I Take me to church I I I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies I I I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife I I Offer me my deathless death I I Good God, let me give you my life I I Take me to church I I I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies I I I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife I I Offer me my deathless death I I Good God, let me give you my life I II I No masters or kings I I When the ritual begins I I There is no sweeter innocence I Than our gentle sin I I In the madness and soil I I Of that sad earthly scene I I Only then I am human I I Only then I am clean I Oh I Oh, amen I I Amen I I Amen I I Take me to church I I I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies I I I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife I I Offer me that deathless death I I Good God, let me give you my life I I Take me to church I I I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies I I I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife I I Offer me that deathless death I I Good God, let me give you my life I II - While I was dancing "Take Me To Church," I didn't talk to anybody. ll was a long shoot, and almost all those hours, I was crying. Everything went through my mind, what Pm leaving behind. I thought I just could Walk away. It would be... H would be easy. - I think a lot of people think that Sergei needs to keep dancing. That's a hard thing, though, because not everyone's Sergei. And he must have a lot of pressure on him. [gentle piano music] II - [laughing] You're push- - Throw me up high. - loan? throw you up high, darling. One day, you will jump as high as he jumps, okay'? II [shears snipping] [razor buzzing] [piano music] II [indistinct chatter] ' See? When Sergei worked here, there were a lot of pictures of him. They took them away. - When Sergei was Mile, I didn't understand family is the main thing. I understood that I had to feed my family. If I could turn back time, I would've spent more time with them. II [cheers and applause] II I never thought I'd be at one of Sergei's concerts. As I watched him, I couldn't believe my eyes. It's just impossible to explain. II - I used to get very nervous when my parents were watching, but I think it's a joint effort where I'm at. And I don't know why, but for some reason, now it feels good to share it with them. II [cheers and applause] [indistinct chatter] - Oh, look who's here! - Dad! - Hi. [laughter] Great job! - Goodness, how great it is to see you! Thank you so much, sweetheart. - You're so warm! - Yeah? - You must be so tired! Forgive me. - Forgive you? For what? - Oh, goodness, my love. I love you so much. You are the best! The very best! - How long have we not seen each other? - A year and a half. A year and a half, right? A year and a half. - Well, we have to do it more often from now on! - Do try. - My sweetheart. - F would He if! would say f don'? love dancing. Because it is the most enjoyable time when you're actually at your top and you are dancing through the air. You jump, and then this is... you know, this is who you are. - Take a picture of us and Sergei. Just don't cover the camera. Don't put your hand there. We made a lot of sacrifices. We tried to give him everything we've got. We did everything we could. And if necessary, We would do it all again. - Sergei, darling... come over here. - To your family. - Show the camera how tough you are! - That's enough. [bright instrumental music] II [rock music] II - I Having trouble telling I I How I feel but I I I Can dance, dance, dance I I Couldn't possibly tell you I I How I mean but I I I Can dance, dance, dance I I So when I trip on my feet I I Look at the beat, the words are I I Written in the sand I I When I'm shaking my hips I I Look for the swing I I The words are I I Written in the air I II I Oh, dance I I I was a dancer all along I I Dance, dance, dance I I Words can never make up for what you do I II I Easy conversations I I No such thing I I No, I'm shy, shy, shy I I My hips, they lie 'cause in reality I I Aye, I'm shy, shy, shy I I When I trip on my feet I I Look at the ground, the words are I I Written in the dust I I When I'm shaking my hips I I Look for the swing I I The words are I I Written in the air I I Oh, dance I I I was a dancer all along I I Dance, dance, dance I I Words can never make up for what you do I II I Oh, dance I I I was a dancer all along I I Dance, dance, dance I I Words can never make up for what you do I I Dance, dance, dance I I Oh, I was a dancer all along I I Dance, dance, dance I I Words can never make up for what you do I - I Dance, dance, dance I I Dance I I Dance, dance, dance I I Dance I I Dance, dance, dance I - I I was a dancer all along I I Dance, dance, dance I I Now words can never make up for what you do I - I Dance, dance, dance I I Dance I I Dance, dance, dance I I Dance I I Dance, dance, dance I
