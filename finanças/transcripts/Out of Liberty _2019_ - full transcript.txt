[DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING] [HORSE WALKING] [HORSE SNORTS] [MEN CONVERSING SOFTLY] Tillery's on his way back. - He's got the basket? - As usual. We're doing this. Lyman. Lyman. Are you good? [COUGHING] [HORSE SNORTS] [FOOTSTEPS] [WHISPERING] What about Doniphan? - He'll leave. - And if he doesn't? You think he wants to eat with us? Tonight is the night. We all agreed on it. Even Joseph. [ALEXANDER MCRAE] We all prayed about it. Not all of us. I don't need to pray to know that I should leave this wretched jail. [LYMAN COUGHS] You can do this, Lyman. [DOOR CREAKING] [JOSEPH SMITH] We need you to petition the state for another court of inquiry. They won't hear it. We need to find a judge who will hear our case. One that isn't biased against our people. Joseph, that's not likely. General Doniphan, the Saints are being driven from their homes. Governor Boggs' extermination order is being seen by many as justification for the increased hostility towards our people. They're ransoming their property to the state in exchange for their lives. They have nothing left. Not a lot of people are for you right now. Emma will be leaving for Quincy soon. We need to be with them. You have to convince the state to release us. That's unlikely. This was printed last week in the "Missouri Republican". What is taking so long? Joseph knows we're ready. Another minute won't kill you. If we could be so lucky. "The situation with the Saints grows increasingly difficult." Being forced from their homes, they are generally poor, facing starvation, destitute. As leaders push their writ of habeas corpus, questions arise about the legality "of their imprisonment in Liberty." That's enough. Enough? This type of awareness has the potential to change opinions. Opinions are not truth. I need you down. [GROANS] You're not gonna let them up? After I have a word with your attorney. - Are we not... - Shh, shh. General, these men are being held for treason. I can't tolerate plotting against the leaders and laws of this state. Nobody's plotting against the state. My clients have been here for two months. It's okay to help them out a little. Doniphan's filing the petition. - What's the timeline? - Nothing yet. So we wait? No, it's not worth it. We will never get anything fair here. Not in northern Missouri at least. I will not spend another night in this wretched pit. There's been no ruling on the charges. Don't be quick to judge. The state's not holding them for no reason. Treason and murder. [DONIPHAN] I've heard the accusations. These ain't light charges. - You been studying law, Sam? - Some. And if half the charges against these men are true, they are the most scurrilous, degenerate men in all of Missouri. And if half are untrue? If half of them are lies? What does that say about the men who falsely accused them or rushed to judgment? Are you well enough to make it to the brush? I don't know. We're not gonna leave you behind. - [LYMAN COUGHS] - Since you brought it up, you've got a commission from the state to take care of these men. I treat 'em right. What's that you're feeding them? They get what they need. They get visitors, they get letters. Sheriff Hadley knows I keep a good watch. Sheriff Hadley knows the stories like the one in the Republican are gonna stir things up for you here. He trusts me. Is that who you're trying to impress? Sheriff Hadley? Trying to become deputy? A lot of people want to see my clients dead. Seems keeping them safe inside is a good thing till things settle down. You've got the most hated men in Missouri in there, a governor who wants to wash his hands of them, and a press that's happy to confuse the issue as long as they keep selling papers. And you think things will settle down? Just get them better food, Sam. Lyman, you follow me up. Alexander, you come up next. Be sure to block Tillery's sightline. We quietly make our way out the door. You come last. Then we lock him in. Be sure to get the keys. - They'll be by his books. - How do you know that? - Because that's where he puts them. - [TRAPDOOR THUDS] [SAM] Come up. Stay together. [SUSPENSEFUL THEME PLAYING] Just get to the door. I'll take it from there. [HYRUM SMITH] Block Tillery. You stick with me. I'll get us out of here. [MEN CLAMORING OUT OF CELL] [LYMAN COUGHING] Help... Help me. [LYMAN, WHISPERING] I can't. I can't do this. [COUGHING] [JOSEPH] Hyrum? [SAM] Food not good enough for you? [ALEXANDER] Has it ever been? [COUGHING] [LYMAN COUGHING] [LYMAN] Bucket. [VOMITING] I can't make it. You take one more step, you'll make a Missouri hero out of me. [JOSEPH] Sam. We just need you to listen to us. [SAM] You listen to me. [SIGHS] That's it. [VOMITING] We'll force our way out the next time we're up there. And if that doesn't work? Then we'll try every day after that until we're free. If you really want to know how we got here, start-start... start back from the beginning. You best pull yourself together. Before we all die in here. [SIDNEY RIGDON] Independence, Missouri. [SOFT THEME PLAYING] [SIGHS] Leaving late tonight, Sam? Tell your friends to stop pestering these men, Neil. [NEIL] I don't control what everyone does. There's a lot of angry men about. I'll be sure to keep the door locked. How long you gonna keep protecting them, Sam? It's four feet of rock and timber that's protecting them. Has nothing to do with me. I don't got a key. - You got a key, Neil? - Comes with the job, Parker. You want yours back? I hear the state's hiring. Listen, we want justice just like you. There comes a time when you can't just sit there and do nothing. People got to pay for their crimes, and them turning the legal system against itself, that only hurts the good people of Missouri. You're letting the Mormons make a fool of you. You're sitting in there with them, reading from your book. Bringing them food in your little bucket. Your time here... it ain't gonna make up for what you've done. Stop pestering these men, Neil. Let the law handle it. It's not for you or for me to interfere. [HORSE WALKING] [NEIL] Sam Tillery. The traitorous captain of Liberty Jail. Running from a fight like he done in the war. Don't you worry! We'll keep an eye on Liberty for you. [ROCK PELTS DOOR] [SAM] Liberty will be fine without you. [ROCK THUDS] [SAM] The Mormons showed up on our side of the river, well, maybe seven years ago. Refugees from a war they got themselves into down in Jackson County. The leaders, they were transferred here a month ago from the jail in Richmond. And y'all are here to help with the attention that they're bringing. Joe Smith, the leader of the Mormons, in Clay County Jail right here in Liberty. You get to talk to him? He tell you about that gold Bible he got? I haven't asked him to. You reckon it's true how he got it? None of my concern. Joe Smith. Oh, hold up. [SUSPENSEFUL THEME] [JOHN BRASSWELL] Who is it? [SAM] I don't know. [JAMES FORD] What do we got here? - Cyrus, get back. - What is it? Shh! There ain't nothing for you here! Hold up. Porter? That you? He's a friend of theirs. Porter, put it down. They still got friends? [PORTER] Pretty quick on the draw, Sam. Just protecting my jail. Who were you jumping to shoot so bad? Just a couple of locals making threats, that's all. Say they're gonna kill my prisoners before the lawyers can set 'em free. That sounds more than a threat. I haven't seen you two before. Old Porter and I, we've been here quite a few times, getting letters from the prisoners, taking them to the Saints. They stirring up trouble for you? Protecting the prophet? My job is to keep the prisoners till justice can run its course. Ain't got nothing to do with religion. Course it's hard to find the Saints to give them their letters because they're all so displaced, you know. We caught up with Brother McRae's kids just the other day, and his wife. They were all there. Fact, there was 11 of 'em. You know he has ten daughters? They were taken from their homes... not fair. They ain't got no place to go. And now here we are, here in this, you know, whatever we want to call this place. - Thick walls. - [SAM] It's a jail. [CYRUS DANIELS] Absolutely. Yeah, this a jail if I ever saw one. I'm gonna need your weapon. [CYRUS] Yeah, once these men are released, we're gonna take them to the Mississippi to meet up with the Saints. It's gonna be a reunition like ain't nobody ever seen. Maybe you'll be there. I don't know. Whoa! [ALEXANDER] Time to change the bucket. [MEN GROANING] Smells a lot like you, Porter. I ain't touching it. Now bring it up with you. [LAUGHING] That one got them. [WHISPERING] Okay, okay, listen. This is it. Just look to me. As soon as he leaves the door, we make our move. Lyman, you good? I'll make it work. - [COUGHS] - Attack at the door. As soon as you're through, head for cover. Alexander, make sure... [CALEB] He's got it. He's got it. - Sidney. - Hyrum. [HYRUM] Joseph. Just don't make any sudden moves. [QUIET LAUGHTER] For God and Liberty. [MEN] For God and Liberty. [STRAINING] Thank you. Brother Cyrus. Brother Joseph. We almost brought you some supplies, but we... Brother Porter. Be ready. Gentlemen, Joseph Smith. Figured you'd be taller. [CHUCKLES] There's a lot of stories out there. That's typical for a con man. Friends of yours, Sam? [SAM] John Brassfield. James Ford. State sent some help. Ugh. Take it out. I'll do it. [SUSPENSEFUL THEME PLAYING] Go on. That's far enough. Please, Lord. Let this be right. I hear y'all are trying for a new trial. I think that's a great idea. The more people this case can get in front of the better. - If you guys can... - Cyrus. Just... Mind if we sit? [ALEXANDER] One of you gonna be here at night? Take care of the degenerates yelling in the window all night? That not your job? They say they're gonna kill us before the hearing. Any of you bring any kind of food, something? - No. - No? [CALEB] How about you? Good thing the state sent in more help. - Mm-hmm. - Treating us like animals. You have an hour. - Don't hurry back. - [DOOR CREAKS] Now! Go, go, go, go! Push! Push! - Push! - Push, Caleb! [MEN SHOUTING] - Don't let him close the door! - Push! Push! Come on! Come on! [HYRUM] Cyrus, push! Get the keys! My keys! - Get the gun! - I got it! I got it! [MEN] Push! [HYRUM] Get the gun! Get the gun! Aah! Aah, my hand! Get the Gun! Push! [MEN SHOUTING] [GRUNTING] [SIDNEY] They shot him! They shot him! They're gonna kill us! They're gonna kill us! All prisoners down in the hole! Now! Anyone still up, I'll put you in irons. Joseph! Is Porter's gun put away? It is! John? [JOHN] We're good! [UNLOCKING DOOR] [EXHALES] [JAMES] I see you breathing. Roll over. No, please. Don't. You ain't so talkative now, huh? [HYRUM] Cyrus is up. He's okay. He's okay. Open up in there! Let the sheriff know we're holding two more. [TRAPDOOR THUDS] [SAM] Next. It's pointless and wasteful to chain anyone else. We're not going anywhere. And if we were to try, we certainly wouldn't leave anyone behind. Since when would the state make any logical decisions? That's enough about the state. Next. What company were you in? I can always tell when a man has seen battle. It don't matter. You a Marine? You want out of here, you get out by the law. And I will stop any man, veteran or not, who tries otherwise. Next. [CYRUS] You plan on keeping us here all night? [SAM] They'll come for you when they can. Well, we got to eat something. [JAMES] No, you don't. [CYRUS] That's unlawful. [JAMES] Coming from the fool who tried to attack me today. [DISTANT THUNDER RUMBLING] You know, those men you got down there? The ones you say is breaking the law? You know they're innocent, right? People saying things about them just to get a rise. Before you know it, you don't know what to believe. [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING] What's truth, what's lies. What's in between. Enough confusion surrounds a man, he becomes a threat. Pretty soon, you begin to hate him without really even knowing why. And then you're blinded by that hate. [DISTANT THUNDER RUMBLING] And the truth don't matter none. You know that man down there, Joseph Smith? Why do people hate him so bad? What'd he do to earn the disdain of men from here to New York? Where they curse his name just at the sound of it. What'd he do, hmm? Print a book? Form a church? Build a city? No, I'll tell you what he did. That man you got chained up down there like an animal... so everybody in Missouri can let their hate fester? That man saw God. He communed with the almighty Jehovah, just like Moses and Isaiah before him. What, you think he's the first prophet of God to be locked up? Hmm? Falsely accused? It's a pattern. People don't like being told what to do, especially from men of God. So you cast him out. You beat him. You stone him. You curse him, you strip him, you starve him, you spit on him, you do every unthinkable thing. And that fuels your hate. That fuels your hate. No matter. God proves his prophets. He'll prove this one... and he'll make sure you know about it. In this life or the next. [MEN SHOUTING OUTSIDE] [NEIL] Tillery, you in there?! Come on, Sam! You want a trial?! Well, we've got a jury! We're ready, Sam! Get away from there, they'll see you! [NEIL] Tonight's the night! [MAN] You make me sick! [NEIL] Bring 'em out! Come on, Sam! Bring 'em out. Or this place goes up. What are you doing, Neil? Your deputy said they tried to make an escape. Get out of the way, Sam! Go on home to your wife and kids. My family knows where I am. Does yours, Ben Miller? We told you things would get worse for you. Hold up there. Sam, Missouri has served us up an opportunity to punish these men for what they've done. They broke the law. New order. Says to get rid of them. What are you saying to do, Neil? Joe Smith killed my brother at Crooked River. I'm sorry, Sam. But justice got to be served today. - [THUNDER RUMBLING] - Let's go! The right to punishing crime, like murder, is, in a state of nature, vested in each individual. But, in a state of society, that right is transferred from the individuals to the sovereign power. As such, preventing men from being judges in their own causes. You learn that from your book? I did. Yeah. Well... that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. [LAUGHTER] Listen, Sam, I don't want you to get hurt in this. But I'm not going to let these men escape. That's close enough. These men are an infection in the state! It's time to burn 'em out! [CHEERING] No! I don't want them over here! [MAN] Here you go! Fire! [ALARMED SHOUTS] - [ALEXANDER] Hey! - [POUNDING] Bring a gun down here! - Hey, where you going?! - I don't know. [GRUNTS] Are we gonna die tonight? They got a guard with a gun in their dungeon. Just let 'em out, Sam. Now, I don't have a whole lot of say on what you raise out here. But if you or any of your men interfere with my job to keep these men jailed, I'll put a bullet in your head. Now get your foot off my jail. Got some fight in you after all. It's up to you, Neil. How do you want this to end? - [GUNSHOT] - [HORSES WHINNYING] Evening, gentlemen. Are we having a meeting I don't know about? Sheriff, we were just coming to check up on Sam. Heard something about the prisoners trying to escape. [SAM] These men were just leaving. Ah. Leaving now, huh? Gentlemen, Sam Tillery here may like it when his friends stop by and visit him each night, but as Justice of the Peace, I'm afraid I can't have that. Man has a job to do. And you're interfering. So, uh, why don't you go on home and give my jailer a break, or I'll throw you in there and let the Mormons preach at you. You just holler if you need anything. - Sheriff. - Huh? Things getting tough for you, Sam? I was handling it. They know that? Hear you got yourself a couple of stowaways in there. Visitors. Tried to help them escape. We stopped it, though. Well, good work, son. Tell you what. Why don't you bring 'em out to me, and I'll, uh, be happy to take 'em off your hands for you. Cowards. They never want to stay and play. [LAUGHS] Whoo! What's he doing with your gun? - Give me that. - Hey. [HYRUM LAUGHS] Slow down. And oil that hammer. Hey, you need to shut your mouth. Is that your grandma's rifle? I won't tell anyone. - Is it? Is it? - That ain't funny. - Shut your mouth. - That ain't funny! That ain't funny. [CHEWING] [WIND BLOWING] [SPILLING] [LIQUID POURING] [SOMBER THEME PLAYING] Emma. [BABY COOING] [CHUCKLES] [SAM] Ma'am. We'd like to see our husbands. No one here except for me and the prisoners. Joseph Smith. Hyrum Smith. We are told they are being kept here. Visiting rights have been suspended. On whose orders? Mine. A father should be able to see his newborn son. [FUSSING] You shouldn't have brought him here. This isn't a safe place to be. Safer in there than standing out here. Most visitors want to break them out or kill them. And of which do you suspect us? I thought Joseph was persuasive. [SOFT THEME PLAYING] [BABY COOS] Oh. [BABY FUSSING] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [HYRUM] What is it? - It's a date for the hearing. - Hmm? Two weeks, Clay County Courthouse, Judge Turnham. [JOSEPH] What do we know of Turnham? [DONIPHAN] Not much. Judge King had grievances with your people. Turnham doesn't, that we know of. A judge should withhold any personal bias in order to offer a fair judgment based on law. Even those appointed to judge are subject to the persuasive leanings of the masses. Not the way I see it. [JOSEPH] Well, Mr. Tillery, were there a way to have you hear our case, we'd gladly appoint you. [MAN HUMMING] ♪ Save Missouri from the Mormons ♪ ♪ Grab your torches, grab your guns ♪ ♪ Lock your doors and stay up late ♪ ♪ Protect your daughters from their sons ♪ - [MEN LAUGHING] - ♪ Ohhh ♪ [MAN 2] That's real dark burnt meat. - [MAN 3] That's Mormon meat. - [MAN 2] That's right. [THUMPS] [MEN] ♪ Save Missouri from the Mormons ♪ ♪ Grab your torches ♪ - Hyrum. ♪ Grab your guns ♪ ♪ Lock your doors and stay up late ♪ ♪ Protect your daughters from their sons ♪ [SKITTERING] [QUIET LAUGHTER] [THUMP] [THUMP] [SIDNEY, MUMBLING] You really want to know how we got here, start... Start... start back from the beginning. So it was agreed to build fortifications throughout the night and... If we must fight, we would save our lives as dearly we could. The cattle and pigs, they... They wandered in. They... They wandered in. The... Children of Israel. It's all we could do. Mr. Don... I... I won't allow Mr. Doniphan to represent us. Did you hear me, Joseph? Uh-huh, okay. I'm not a lawyer, but I can do a better job of getting us out of here than... than he can. That's a dumb fool idea. Likely to get us all convicted. The hearing, Caleb, isn't to get a conviction. It's a court of inquiry to determine the need for a jury at an actual trial. Still, our lawyer should handle it. Not somebody in your condition. [SIDNEY] My condition? [CHUCKLES] You criticize me while we sit in this cesspool for months? We're all sick. Half-starved. [COUGHS] Poisoned. And our lawyer is incapable of coming to our defense. At the last hearing, all that he proved is that he was ill-prepared and that he spoke without a plan. [ALEXANDER] You weren't even there, Sidney. Turning jail into sick bay while we endured a mock trial. There was not one fact that was not misrepresented. And not one witness that did not swear falsely against us. Because they'd have been killed if they'd spoke. They had to protect the witnesses. He should have protected us, not the witnesses. He acted in fear. General Doniphan stood up for us against an execution order. And look where that got us. The truth will protect us. Not if it's unable to be heard! And a mumbling fool is going to make them hear it? No. I am not going to let your childish tantrums ruin the one chance that I have of seeing my wife and daughters. - You're not the only one with a family, Alexander! - That's enough! Sidney's right. It was a mock investigation. A farce. Judge King's brother-in-law got killed in Jackson County, and he held us accountable. Sidney's a skilled orator. He's at liberty of choosing his own representation. Joseph. His pride has clouded his judgment. They'll think he's a mumbling wretch who lost his mind. Have no fear. Huh? If you go without fear, not a hair of your heads will be harmed. And in time, we will be released. Oh, stop it. You don't know. I do! And if you knew, this would be an easier time for you. For all of us. [MUMBLING] It started... It started in DeWitt. Ah... with... Four months ago. With winter coming. We... We went down there. Because they had no houses. We had no sustenance. God is with us. [SIDNEY] We were abandoned. He is our friend. [SIDNEY] Everything was lost. He will save our souls. Our wives and children are out there being harassed by the mobs. And those who fight against us will reap the fruits of their labor. [SIDNEY] There is no justice for the wicked. Walls and irons. Walls and irons. Doors and creaking hinges. Half scared to death guards stopping innocent men from escaping are calculated in their very nature to make the soul of honest men stronger. Walls and irons. Stronger than the powers of hell. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SOFT THEME PLAYING] - So how was your day? - Fine, I guess. - [GROANING] - [WATER SLOSHING] Little early for the liquor. Now, now, it's rude to stare. Are you still here? - Hey, Smith brothers. - Hey. - Lyman. - Porter. You and Cyrus made it out? They charged us with aiding in you escaping jail. An act for which you're clearly innocent. [LAUGHS] Well, we'll try harder next time. Uh, any news from our families or...? No. Not from yours. Most everybody's gone from here. Sidney in there? [ALEXANDER] Yeah. Nerves have got him. Hey, Sidney! - How are you doing? - Come on, come on. You hold on, okay? I saw your wife and daughters. How are they? Are they... Are they safe? They're fine. I told them you were fine, too. Then you lied to them. [CHUCKLES] Hey, I brought you something. Here. Go on take it. [JOSEPH] Here, here. Careful. You take it. I have not had clean water for days. [JOSEPH LAUGHS] Are you still looking to escape? It is our obligation to escape. The men here, they don't care about justice. They only care about our destruction. I know. So you told us. Here, I got something else for you. I think you're gonna like it. Here, take it. [ALEXANDER] What in the world? [PORTER] I got another one for you. Here. Here. Got it. - How did you... - Don't ask. Got a lot of funny looks, though. More than usual? Now, what you're gonna do, these walls are four feet thick. So if you cut through three, four inches a day, you can get... get out in less than two weeks. But you got to... you got to use 'em both together so you can make a hole. Porter, we... we got it. Right. Okay, sorry. Here. Here, just another sip. I got it. Here it comes. Here it comes. Okay, okay, okay. Careful, careful. [PORTER] You take care now. And remember, you got to use your shoulders. Your arms will get dead tired if you just use your arms. Thank you, fellow wanderer. For everything. You just get yourself out, Joseph. We miss you. Godspeed, friend. Yeah, okay. Well, I got to go. I'm jumping bail. [LAUGHING] Don't tell anyone I was here. [LAUGHING] Here. Right here. Through these walls? With those? He is an innocent and noble man. And was an innocent and noble child. - [THUD] - [GRUNTING] [SIDNEY] It won't work. It'll never work. It'll never work. No, my soul loves him. [HYRUM, GRUNTS] I think it could work. [STRAINING] Got it. It's an exercise in futility. Adding insult to injury. I... I won't watch. [GRUNTS] You know what is an exercise in futility? Turning water into wine. [LYMAN] And telling a lame man to walk. Or healing even one blind beggar when there's hundreds of others suffering. Or raising the dead for that matter. I'm familiar with the miracles in the New Testament. At this moment, they bring me no hope. Perhaps you prefer the miracles of the Old Testament. Or the Book of Mormon. Jesus still suffered, despite the miracles that he performed. We'll be dead by the time those things dig us out of here. Then don't watch. [GRUNTS] Here bring the other one over here. Let's go, at the same time. Joseph, here. Let's get them both going. Oh! Two of them! [SIDNEY] Walls that are four feet thick. Why have you forsaken us?! There's no escape. - We will never survive this! - Get a hold of yourself! - You're hopeless. - We're hopeless! Not even Jesus has suffered as much as I have! [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING] [CRYING] [TOOLS CLACKING] [VOICE WHISPERING] [SIDNEY, MUMBLING] We... We all went to DeWitt. [MUTTERING] We all went on to DeWitt. - [LYMAN] Sidney. - They... They told us that we couldn't. That we shouldn't. - Sidney. - They retaliated. They... They attacked us. They attacked us. They attacked us for trying to help our people. Joseph. Joseph, I don't know what to do. Shh shh shh shh. Sidney is a... is a very great and good man. He is, though, selfish. I'm sure it destroys your confidence in him. We can suffer him, though, for a while longer. He is a man whom God will uphold if he will continue faithful. [MEN STRAINING] [BLOWING] [GROANING] - Here, let me have a go. - [GRUNTS] [NEIL, SING-SONG] Joseph! Joseph! It's me. Your guardian angel. - Stop it! - What are y'all doing in there? Stop it! Stop it! - Hurry. Hurry. - Hurry! - [LAUGHING] - Good morning! [NEIL] I bring warm regards from your wives and your people. God and Liberty. Sound familiar? It's what your people shouted when you attacked us at Crooked River. We were ordered to protect Ray County, and you come fire on our camp. You killed my brother, and you got nothing to say about it? A man was shot after a group of vigilantes raided the homes of our people. No. He was a member of the state militia, and he was murdered by a mob of Mormons! He was a wolf, who hid his hair, teeth, and tail in a militia's sheepskin made of wool! That's who your brother was! Come here! [STRUGGLING] Hold his arm! Hold it! - Kill him! - [NEIL GROANS] - You attack unarmed men! - Come on! You think you're the only one to ever fight in a battle? [GROANS] - Hold his arm! - Get it! [CALEB] How does it feel now?! [GROANING] I'll kill every one of you! You think you're safe in there?! Show your face! I'll kill you right now! - Aah! - Shoot them! [NEIL GRUNTING] This is my jail! Oh! That-a-boy, Neil! Hold him! Hold him! [NEIL] This has gone on long enough! Neil! The hearing is in a week! Then they're out of my watch! You hear that?! Only one more week in there! No more walls to hide you! - [SAM GROANS] - We're going to court! [SAM] Let the law handle this. [GROANS] Go inside, Sam. Getting too rough for you out here. [PARKER LAUGHING] Ahh... [MEN STRAINING] [GRUNTING] What's the point anymore? We're gonna be out of here before you can dig that hole. We won't need a hearing if I can just get to... [GRUNTING] - Hey, need me to spot you? - No! I think you're stuck. It's no use. [STRAINING] [HYRUM] Caleb. Caleb, hold on. Wait, Caleb. - [HANDLE SNAPS] - Aah! - Caleb! - Aah! [CALEB GROANING] [HYRUM] Useless. Sorry. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You hit something. [CALEB] What? [STRAINING] Unh! Rock. [CLACKING] This could go quickly. - Ha ha! - This is it! [STRAINING] [ROCK CLATTERING] Here. Here. Here's another one. [ROCK CLATTERS] We'll keep trying. Thank you. You think Sidney's going to argue his way out tomorrow? [KINDLING SNAPS] Sidney was the first man that taught me my religion. Or taught me to care about it. Me and Caleb both. I forget that sometimes. [ALEXANDER] Yeah. I went to a revival that he was preaching at. Harriet and I went out of curiosity. And Sidney preaches this magnificent sermon, like he always does. It was intelligent, logical, direct. And at the end of it, he asked people to come up and be baptized, and I just felt something pull me up there. He spoke in a way that brought a Holy Spirit to stir hearts that could change their very beliefs. So when he joined Joseph in the church, it was impossible not to want to join as well. I don't think that's the same Sidney anymore. [CROWS CAWING] [SPITS] Listen up! This ends today! No one gets in that courthouse, understood? There will be no court today. [STRAINING] Get him. Get him. [EXHALES] You really ought to reconsider this, huh? Let me govern myself, Joseph. Yeah, yeah, come on. You think you guys are getting out today? One way or another. But I need a favor. What? - What's that? - Shh. Take it. Fix it. Bring it back. Hope we're not being judged on appearances. - Where are you going? - I'm a visitor. Don't shoot at me. Gentlemen. We'll need to move quickly before more men gather at the courthouse. The state's gonna protect my men? The state doesn't have the resources to escort you to the courthouse. A couple of deputies on horses? What are we supposed to do? - We go! - No, we wait. We cannot let a gathering mob impede our justice. We should go once we are assured they have disbanded. [DONIPHAN] We'll need to postpone the hearing. We'll file for another petition, and then we'll... Joseph. I will no longer abide this. [DONIPHAN] Wait! Joseph! This is not the way to handle this. Now, James, wait. Keep them here. I will take you to Turnham. Renegades, liars, and murderers have poured down a flood of filthiness and vomit upon our heads, and most men see and acknowledge that it is incorrect. Let Doniphan present that today. Let the system function as it is intended. [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING] Turnham's moved the hearing, but we got to go now. [WHINNIES] [ASSISTANT] All right, we will get started with the court of inquiry with Judge Turnham presiding. It has been noted that we have relocated to the schoolhouse by request of the court. This should be in a proper courthouse. Would your client prefer this in a more hostile setting? [DONIPHAN] No, Your Honor, this is a fine setting. - He doesn't speak for me. - Sidney, enough. Move on. In Daviess County, under the jurisdiction of Judge Austin A. King, charges of treason were upheld and supported by the laws of the county. The state has granted this court of inquiry by request of the defense. [TURNHAM] Mr. Doniphan. Are you ready to proceed? Absolutely. Gentlemen. [GAVEL POUNDS] Where they at, Neil? They ain't coming! There's a group of folks gathered down by the schoolhouse. [MAN] We best be on our way. [NEIL] Sam Tillery. Always running from a fight! [DONIPHAN] Your Honor, in response to the charges of treason against my clients, charged only for the reason that it is unbailable, we request the court consider the legality of such claims. [DOOR OPENS] [MAN] Halt! Stop! Keep out of here! You start without me, Sam? Gentlemen, please! [NEIL] Apologies, Your Honor. [DONIPHAN] Your Honor, as I was saying, with regards to the constitutionality of treason, dating back to 18... [NEIL] Speak up! Let us hear why these men shouldn't be held to the same laws as the people of Missouri. Your Honor, may I approach? Your Honor, my clients cannot have a fair hearing in this setting. For the safety of everyone involved, I request we reschedule before someone gets shot. [CLEARS THROAT] It seems it's in the best interest of the court to return the defendants to the protection of the jail at Liberty. Protection? [CROWD MURMURING] [NEIL] That's right! Back to Liberty! Let's go, boys, this is over. - [TAPPING] - No hearing today. No! - [NEIL LAUGHS] - [SIDNEY] No! [CANE TAPPING] No! [SHOUTING] No! No! I will not allow it! I have suffered to come today to make my case before an honorable court, and so help me, with or without God, I will not allow the intimidation of any man to interfere with my right to be heard. Stand up if you want to speak. Quiet. Let him speak. [SIGHS] All that has been required to persecute a man or a woman in the State of Missouri as of late is a suspicion that they are in what the mob calls the Mormon religion. As leadership of the Restored Church of Jesus Christ, we chose to evacuate one of the settlements which was experiencing extreme persecution. However, thus protecting our people, only gave the mob more courage to increase its violence against us. Can't you stand up, Mormon? [SOMBER THEME PLAYING] The State of Missouri, seeing the increased persecution to our people, brought in a militia to protect us. But instead, they abandoned their posts, leaving us helpless. Some of them even joined the mobs against us. Their job was to protect, yet they fled. After the state had recalled its forces, the mob began setting the prairies on fire, burning our homes and destroying our farms. Our people were forced to live in tents and wagons. One moment, we heard of a planned attack, so we built fortifications throughout the night to protect our lives as dearly as we could. When the morning came, there was no attack. Instead, there was a demand set on our lives. We were taken captive. An order from our governor. For the protection of our people. When our abandoned livestock wandered into our camp, it was thankfully used as sustenance. From that went out the cry that the people of DeWitt were thieves and plunderers, stealing cattle and hogs. [VOICE BREAKING] It was all that they could do to survive. [CROWD WHISPERING] Our people are being torn from their homes and being subject to every ungodly deed of man, and it continues as even we, their appointed leaders, are being held captive in Liberty. You attempt to prove us guilty of treason in consequence of a night of building fortifications for a people in desperate need. You attempt to prove us guilty of murder for an act of defense in which we were not even there. Your charges of theft, larceny, burglary, arson, and stealing are all based on accusations for which I was not even there at the time. I am innocent! And my fellow church leaders are innocent! And the State of Missouri has forsaken justice if we are not to be released this day! [WOMAN] If this man does not go free, that disgrace is on all of you! [NEIL] If this man goes free, they'll all be dead by nightfall. [GAVEL POUNDS] I will not have your threats in this court! Hey, Your Honor, we have money for bail. [MAN 1] There's no bail for treason! - He's buying you out, Judge! - [MAN 2] It's hush money! [MAN 3] What about the extermination order?! Clear this man's charges! Give him immediate release! Never have I had the fortune of hearing a discourse such as this. [WHISPERING] You did it. You did it. The rest of the men are to be taken back to jail to await their trials. This is not the law. You forget yourself, jailer. It's enough, Neil. Let them free. - Your Honor... - Hey! Hey! A Missouri liar! Order! Order! [CROWD SHOUTING] Another time! You're free. You got what you wanted. This is not how I wanted it to be. No. No. Please, please, take me back! Please! Please, Joseph! Please! - He wants to go back. - Then take him! It's not my job to hold an innocent man. I've done all I can. [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING] Drink. [SAM] How do you do it? I've never seen anything like that before. It turned like that. It was something quite unexpected. It's just a matter of taking matters into one's own hands. Not relying on someone else to fix the injustice. I meant turning your back on your friends. Do you have a... a wife, jailer? Are you married? Do you have a family? While I sat in chains in Richmond, and was subject to listen to every vile act that was committed against women by those despicable reprobates, one thing became very clear. That if I had a choice to sit in jail and wait for the state to figure our innocence, or if I could find any way out so that I could be with my wife and my daughters, you can bet, as sure as the day is long, I'm gonna move heaven and hell to get out of here. There's not a man in that cell that wouldn't do the same. Sitting in a jail day after day isn't a position that any man should aspire to. Listen to me, you insufferable drivel! You think I want to be here?! Watching over the likes of you?! Sam. [SIDNEY GASPS] I fought in Bladensburg. Under command of General Winder. We were outnumbered. The enemy marching on us, and we had nowhere to turn. He commanded us to retreat. We ran for our lives while the British set fire to Washington. Ever since that moment, I have been accused of being a traitor and being the cause of the loss of our capitol and of the lives of the men who fought beside me. You can leave your men here tonight, but this will haunt you the rest of your life. You church people think you're the only ones that know suffering. Who have seen an injustice. You go back to your wife, to your daughters. You take them out of Missouri. You find yourself a nice piece of land to settle. The sooner you stop preaching yourself above others, the sooner we'll be closer to living side by side in peace. [KNOCK ON DOOR] [SAM] Who's there? [PHOEBE RIGDON] I'm here for my husband! Sidney. Phoebe. [CRYING] [SIDNEY] I missed you. Look at what they've done to you. You came alone? Cyrus drove right through. He's with the wagon about three miles down. Your friend is leaving! Joseph. Thank you for coming. Phoebe and I are off. Tell our families not to lose hope. I'll do everything that I can to look after the church. Be well, Sidney. Do you suppose there's somebody waiting out there to attack? It's none of my concern. Suppose that we were to wait in... [ALEXANDER SIGHS] It just doesn't sit right with me. He complains himself into jail. Complains the whole time he's here. And then complains himself right out. We just got to suffer it. Right, Joseph? I suppose. [STRAINING] [CHIPPING STONE] [SAM] We're coming down. Everybody against the wall! Now! [SIGHS] Son of a... You allow them to do this to my jail. Here. How'd he get found out? He was bragging about needing a replacement. Fool never could keep his mouth shut. Take care of this. We got a wall to fix! And bring the irons! That's not necessary. Neither was this. [IRONS THUDDING] You carry on for months about how the law is gonna set you free, the whole time trying to scratch your way out of here? We are a target in here. And you of all people know that. You escape, I'm liable. So we're protecting you now. - Leg. - No! You're gonna have to kill me to put those chains on me. Don't make this worse. - [SHOUTING] - Ohh! Hey! Hey! Get back! [SHOUTING] Ooh! [SOUND MUFFLED] [SHOUTING CONTINUING] - [SOUND GROWS CLEARER] - Stop! Stop! [MEN PANTING AND COUGHING] Lock 'em up. Won't be but a minute. Sidney gone? [SAM] Yep. The others? Locked up. You've done right, Sam. Clay County is lucky to have a man like you. You handle this right, we're gonna have a new Justice of the Peace on our hands. Their lawyer's gotten a change of venue from Gallatin to Boone County. Another trial's not gonna help if he's afraid to plead their case. He's not one you should accuse of being afraid. He's risked his job, his reputation, even his life for these men on more than one occasion. Alexander Doniphan's got nothing to prove to anyone. Governor Boggs thinks that Boone County will be safer than Gallatin. Or here. Likely to change the ruling. How does the state, in a course of four months, go from protecting the Mormons with the militia to signing an executive order to have them killed? [SIGHS] Public opinion's a funny thing, Sam. You try to do what's right for the people, but you can never please everyone. One side hates the other. Each is convinced that the other is driven by selfishness, greed, corruption. Anything but the truth. But their voices aren't the loudest. The loudest voice is that of public opinion. It yells, shouts, threatens, and acts out like an unfettered child, demanding whatever it feels, regardless of logic. What are you trying to say? The state now thinks they could be innocent. [SAM SIGHS] I don't know if they are. But I do know that you and I should not be getting ourselves killed for these men. So you surrendered judgment to the people. Our lives were being threatened. A mob becomes the highest governing body? - Careful, Sam. - I have innocent men in chains. You've done right, Sam. Just get them to court in Boone County, and you're done with them. They're someone else's problem. You've done your job, Sam. You've done all that was asked. It's not enough. [FIRE CRACKLING] [SOMBER THEME PLAYING] [SHOUTING] Calm down! Sam! O God, where art thou? Hey! Get back! I want everyone calm! Calm down! And where's the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place? You think I want to be here?! God, how long shall thy hand be stayed and thine eye behold the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants and thy ear be penetrated with their cries? I have been accused of being a traitor... [CRYING] How long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions before thine heart shall be softened towards them and thy bowels shall be moved with compassion towards them? Public opinion is a funny thing, Sam. Not a lot of people are for you right now. Before you know it, you don't know what to believe. Opinions are not truth. Stretch forth thy hand. And let thine anger be kindled against our enemies. There comes a time when you can't just sit there and do nothing. It's not my job to hold an innocent man. Remember thy suffering Saints, O our God. [CRYING] [CHAINS RATTLING] - I never meant for... - [JOSEPH] Shh. Is there any mercy in the law? [SOFT THEME PLAYING] [CRYING] [JOSEPH] Peace. Peace be unto thy soul. Thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment. If thou art accused with all manner of false accusations, if thine enemies fall upon thee, and if thou shouldst be cast into the pit or into the hands of murderers, know thou that all these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good. Walls and irons. Calculated to make the honest soul feel stronger than the powers of hell. [ROOSTER CROWS] Mr. Doniphan. Mr. Tillery. Wasn't planning on seeing you today. Yep. Is it true that you risked your job for these men? I took a stance. Nothing more. [SAM] It would be best if you stayed here. [DONIPHAN] The job's not done till we get them to court in Boone County. My men will handle it. Do you mind? Not at all. [KEYS RATTLE ON TABLE] [DONIPHAN] Food looks better. - Oh! - [SLOSHING] - [LAUGHING] - [SAM] It's not funny! You're going to miss that. I will miss nothing about this place. Nor shall I. [LYMAN COUGHING] You said that we'd get out of here alive. At the time, I found it hard to believe. No doubt that God has placed you here for His purposes. We all leave here changed men. [BUCKET CLANKS] My men will be here any minute. We'll take you to Boone County. It's several days' journey. As prisoners of the state, you all need to be in irons. All of you. [DONIPHAN] I've arranged for a militia escort to go with us. We will not require any militia escort. We will trust in God alone. Joseph, they're to ensure our protection. Here we go. If we rely on the guards, we will be destroyed. It's time. There's a mob assembling. We got to hurry. Your men coming? They'll be here within the hour. No. We will go now. Without 'em. Sam, those men out there want them dead. Half-scared guards. Don't be alarmed. Okay? I know what I'm about. [SHOUTING AND WHOOPING] [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING] Joseph Smith. No more walls or bars to protect you. No sheriff to come and save you. Just a bunch of guilty murderers trying to escape justice. If we are guilty, we refuse not to be punished by the law. Oh, you are guilty. You come into Missouri with all your thoughts and ideas about being a chosen people. Thinking you're better than all of us! - That's enough! - Oh, is it? Is that enough? We're done listening to you, Joe Smith! We're done listening to all of you! [SAM] Leave these men alone, Neil! [NEIL] These men aren't under your protection anymore! He's right, Sam. You've done your duty. Is it the law you want? Is it justice you want? A mob of anonymous cowards gathering to attack the accused. Is that justice? Under the mandate of the governor of this state, these men will be taken to Boone County! Justice will be executed in a proper court of law. Any man who has a problem with that can take it up with me. Well, I do. This worth it to you? Protecting these murderers? They killed my brother. Who murdered women and children. You were there. Killed by a farmer who was protecting his family and his property! And you can switch things up, make the events different. But truth is unchangeable. You watched over these men for five months. Making them suffer for what they've done. Now you want to die for them. Nobody needs to die today. We'll see about that. No! [GROANING] Nobody needs to die today! You're a traitor, Sam Tillery! You always have been! You watch out, I'll be coming for you! I'll be in Boone County! [SOFT THEME PLAYING] [WHINNIES] [JOSEPH] That's a fine animal you got there. Her name's Medley. I paid $100 for her at auction. She's worth every bit of 125. Medley, huh? That's a good name. Whoa. Four days' journey to the Mississippi from here. Do you think your friends are there? [IRONS CLANK] [JOSEPH] God willing, yes. Never took you for a man who'd enjoy a drink while on the job. It's no longer my job. It's my duty. This is my duty. You go to Boone County for jury trial, you're gonna be found innocent and set free. That's the idea. That's what we want. You know what kind of aftermath that's gonna cause in this state? Across the country? The people won't allow that. No. I think the best thing is for my men and I to finish our drinks, take a nice, long rest. And then you just be on your way. The governor knows you're innocent. So does the sheriff and Turnham. - [LYMAN] How? - Everything. Sidney, the Saints, the militias, the extermination order. So we flee, and what comes of you? Your job, your reputation? It's better that ten guilty escape than one innocent suffer. You read that in your book? "Blackstone's Law." That's what this is then, an escape? 125, right? Yes, sir. Okay. How about 150 with all the supplies? I'll make good on it should you come see me. You have my word. Is that the word of a prophet or a con man? Come see me, you'll find out. If I catch any of you in Missouri again, I'll shoot you dead. You shoot any of us dead, I'll kill you with my bare hands. Glad we're straight. You're four days' journey to Quincy. Stay off the main roads. You'll find your way. Thank you, Sam. May you find yours. Let's go. Hyah. [SOFT THEME PLAYING] [KEYS JINGLING] [SOFT THEME PLAYING] [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING]
