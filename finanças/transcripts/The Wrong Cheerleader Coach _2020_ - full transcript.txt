I've seen the other girls, and it comes so natural to them. So I want you to go home, and next week, I want to see you with all the confidence in the world. All right, I'll see you next week, alyssa.

Don't move a muscle. I got it. Hoo! Oh, god. I feel like I've been... Inside of one of these boxes the last 10 hours. You're just getting old. That is true. I am. This place looks smaller than in the photos. well, I wouldn't complain. At least we got a house. We could've ended up in a corporate apartment. Or they could've not made you move at all. Ah, stop that. We've been over this a million times. I don't want to hear any more about it. Sure we can't just get back in the car and head back to chicago? Hey, honey, let me tell you something. You are going to be... Very happy here. Why? Why? Uh, why. Why, because, uh... Because I am going to let you choose whichever room you want in the house for your bedroom, that's why. I'm going to choose the biggest one. Th-that's what, that's what I figured! Um, I would expect nothing... Nothing less! Dad, be careful with my trophies! I know, I know. I'm a pro. I'm a professional. I got this. I just kind of forgot how... Heavy these things were. Geez. Okay, uh... I'll be back as soon as possible. Where are you going? Um, I gotta go by your school, drop off all your registration forms. But school doesn't start until tomorrow. Yes, that's true, but the staff is there today, and they want all of your forms ahead of time, before you start. I will see you back here before dinner. - Okay. - Okay. All right. It's gonna be fine, I promise. Everything's gonna be fine. All right. Bye. Ohh! Oh. - Sorry. - Hello. I'm just trying to find the main office here and get my daughter registered for school. Oh, I assume she's a freshman? Senior, actually. We just moved here from chicago. Today, as a matter of fact, if you can believe that. It's a good thing you allowed yourselves plenty of time. Yeah, yeah, no doubt. It wasn't by choice, I can tell you that. It's all work-related and very last-minute. Yeah, well, I'm sure she'll enjoy her senior year here. I'm janice burke, one of the physical ed teachers here, - and this is... - Devan walters. Jon thompson. Daughter's name is hanna. - Hanna. - Yeah. Well, as far as the main office, it's... I was actually heading that way. I could show mr. Thompson where that is. Oh, okay. Well, thank you, miss walters. - A pleasure to meet you. - You too. - All right, well, take care. - Thanks so much. - Come on, this way. - Sure, thanks, appreciate it. You're not a teacher here, are you? - No. - You a student or... oh, you just made my day. I'm actually on the faculty. I'm the cheerleading coach... well, assistant coach. Coach burke is actually the head coach as well as being a phys-ed teacher. Oh, who I just met. I wish I would have known that. My daughter's a cheerleader. She's pretty good too. Well, I hope she tries out for the team. Oh, she definitely will be. Don't worry. I'll keep an eye out for her, I promise. It's my first year at lincoln too, so we have something in common. Oh, okay. Well, I appreciate that. - That sounds very nice of you. - Yeah, no worries. So is it just you, your wife, and your daughter? Uh, well, no. My wife's no longer with us. It's just hanna and I, yeah. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I guess that's something else we have in common. My father raised me alone as well. Oh, uh, yeah. Well, it's, uh... - Glad to meet you. - Must be fate. Hey, that's certainly a way of putting it, all right. So you see the double doors right there by the flagpole? - Yeah. - You're going through there. Okay, all right. I owe ya. And I intend to collect. Push. doin' good. Don't forget to breathe. Nice! Good job. Two more than last session. I really needed this workout. You're a lot more fun to work out with than my regular clients. I'm getting tired of telling blue-haired old ladies how to turn on the elliptical. So what is it? What's bothering you? Oh, nothing. It's complicated. Of course it is, or else it wouldn't be bothering you. It's just... The father of one of the cheerleaders I coach. What, are you seeing him or something? Like I said, it's complicated. Well, that's your first problem right there. - What is? - Dating an old man. You need somebody your age, somebody that can hang with you. You think because you have perfect biceps and that your hair isn't yet gray and that your chest is as smooth as a baby seal that you're so much better than him? - What are you talking about? - Let me tell you something. You want to know what older men have? They have class. They have experience. They have sophistication. You can't find any of that on the lat bar. I didn't mean anything by it. It was a joke anyway. Well, it wasn't funny. You could learn a thing or two from older men. Now, come help stretch me out. I have to keep up with a bunch of teenagers. This is not pizza. You know, it's... Pizza's not, uh... Bad. Sure, if you've never tasted pizza before. Oh, there is a rumor that there is a proper chicago-style parlor down the street from the office, okay? I'll believe that when I taste it. I, myself, am looking forward to experiencing the culinary delights that this town has to offer. Sure, if you like tofu and meatless burgers. Oh, now, that is a complete myth. You saw when we were driving through town. There's a taco shop, a hamburger joint, a hot dog stand on every corner in this town. Hey, babe, you gotta give it a chance. I just wish I wasn't going into my last year of high school. Well, honey, unfortunately, I am the only architect at the firm that they trusted to oversee this project. You could've said no. Not with college coming up next year, I couldn't. If I go to college. If? Hey! You know how important education was to your mother. I know, I know. I was only kidding, dad. But it doesn't mean I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in college like mom did. She didn't spend her whole life in school. Now, granted, it did take a long time for her to get her phd, but, you know, research was important to her. Yeah, a lot of good it did her. Hey, that's enough of that. Come on. Just relax. Enjoy your night. Stay fresh for school tomorrow, okay? - Yeah, you're right. - All right. As for me, I'm beat. That's it. I can't take anymore I'm gonna turn in. All right. I'm gonna hang out down here for a little while longer. - Okay, babe, not too late. - I know. - Love you. - Love you. Oh! I completely forgot. I ran into your cheerleading coaches today. - Both of them. - For real? Yeah, the head coach and the assistant coach. I think the assistant one is just new to the school as well. What was she like? To be honest, I don't remember. I was I was very distracted. But she did say that she would look out for you. Well, if that's what it takes for me to make the team, then I'm in big trouble. Oh, come on, honey. Honey, you'll make the team. You know why? Because you, you're great. You've always been great. - Love you. - Night. Hello, daddy. hello? Is someone there? Hey! sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. You didn't think I might be afraid of a stranger lurking around my property in the middle of the night? Um, I didn't realize anybody had moved in. This house had been empty for a while. Well, we did. Just today. My dad and I. I live like right there. Our backyards practically touch. Hmm. It's easier to see in the daytime. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm ben. Ben fremont. Hanna thompson. So you go to lincoln then? I do. Yeah, one more year. At least I'll know one person tomorrow. You on the football team? Let me guess. Star quarterback. - Really? - I don't know about the star, but, yeah, I'm the quarterback. Well, I'm a cheerleader. At least I was. I'm trying out for the team though, so... Cool. Hey, so listen, I'm probably gonna go back inside, but, um... Do you have a car? I wish. We have one, and my dad is always using it for work. Well, uh, you should let me give you a ride tomorrow. - Yeah? - Yeah. You don't wanna take the bus on the first day. It'll be a disaster. Okay. Cool. So I'll pick you up at 8:00. Sounds good. Morning! Hey, sweetie. How'd you sleep? Deep. I was a lot more tired than I thought. How come you're dressed like that? Um, because I am going to go by the work site before I go to the office. We're gonna have to get going here pretty soon. Actually, I got a ride. I'm sorry. Uh, you got a ride? Yeah. I met someone. He's driving me. Okay, what kind of weird interdimensional portal did I just step through? I met him last night. He's our neighbor. It was right after you went to sleep. Heard him walking around the backyard last night, and he came over to introduce himself. I-I don't know about this. Dad, come on. He's a senior at lincoln too. He's our neighbor. He's shy. Trust me. I'm in good hands. That's what I'm afraid of. All right. I mean, you know, you're almost an adult. I trust you. I'm gonna get out of here. You have a great day. And, uh, I know for a fact that you are gonna kill it. - Thank you. - "kill it." that's what the kids are saying, right? Kill it? - No. - No? Okay. Back to the drawing board. - Hi. - Hey. I didn't know if I should come get you or... no, it's fine. I saw you pull up, so... - You look nice. - Thanks. - Let's go. - Yeah. Yeah. Morning. This message is for philip beck. Phil, this is jon thompson at brunswick construction. I'm the architect overseeing the project here. I really need to talk to you and, uh... As a matter of fact, why don't you just come by the site, instead of the office this morning? I think that would be the best. Thank you. Unbelievable. So you're sure you don't mind doing this? Of course not. Besides, I think you'll need it. Your sport can be a little intense. - Now you're making me nervous. - No, no. It's just she takes cheerleading really seriously. But she likes me for some reason, so it's all good. - hello, ms. Burke. - Mr. Fremont. Welcome back. I hope you had a nice and productive summer. Don't worry. I was training every day. Good. Have a seat. I wanted to introduce you to someone. This is my neighbor, hanna thompson. She's here for senior year. Hanna. I met your father, mr. Thompson, the other day. Welcome to lincoln. - Thank you. - She's a cheerleader, so I wanted her to meet you right away. Hanna, I'm sure you've heard that cheerleading here at lincoln is different than most other schools, and I'm sure mr. Fremont told you that I hold our cheerleaders to high standards, both athletic and academically. It was like that at my other school, ms. Burke. And don't worry. I've been cheering for as long as I can remember. In fact, my dad likes to say I was born next to a pair of pom-poms. Let me be honest with you, miss thompson. It won't be easy for you here. I've had dozens of girls that have tried out year after year, and they've yet to make the team. But if you do make it, I can promise you that nothing will be more challenging or rewarding. Understand? Yes, I understand. Good. Excuse me, are you jon thompson? I am, yes. Melissa ross. Phil sent me. Oh. Gotcha. Sending somebody else over to deliver the... Mea culpa. Unfortunately, sometimes that's part of the job. So the concrete wasn't ready when you arrived? Um, I'm sorry, the what? Oh, the, uh... no, no, no. It's not... it has to do with the forms being not built yet. They were supposed to be done days ago, the concrete. Well I'd love to tell you that nothing like this ever happens, but the truth is sometimes it does. And since we can't go back in time, how about I have a carpentry team out here tomorrow? They're good. They work quickly. Yeah, I would really appreciate that. So you moved out here from the midwest, right? I did. Chicago. With my daughter. Well, if you need any recommendations on anything, restaurants and whatnot, just let me know. I've lived around here my whole life. I won't steer you wrong. I-I would really appreciate that. Yeah. Miss ross or mrs. Ross? - Melissa. - Melissa. A restaurant recommendation would be great because I, myself, I'm a bit of a foodie. Well, my personal cell is on there. Oh. Use that. Yep, that's right on there. There it is. Got it. So how's it going with that guy you told me about? I don't want to talk about it. You sure? I might be able to help. Yeah? Can you moonlight as a hitman and dispose of a rival for me? yeah, see, I knew you were useless. Devan, what are you talking about? I think he might be seeing someone else. - Well, were you two exclusive? - Of course! What kind of girl do you think I am? One that deserves to be treated right. What are you doing, jack? Nothing. I just thought that... just thought because I'm having relationship problems that I'll forget everything and jump into bed with you? No. Devan, really? That I'm dating an older man, so, hell, she really must be desperate. Let's see if I can get a piece. I swear, I didn't mean anything like that. Let me tell you something, jack. You lay another hand on me in a nonprofessional way, and I'll scream sexual harassment so fast, you won't have time to grab your jock strap before they throw you out of the club.

Cheerleading is not just an extracurricular activity. It's a calling. So if any of you think that this is a joke, or you think that I'm being funny, you probably won't make the team. You will have three days of tryouts to make a good impression. So, ladies, if I was you, I would make the most of them. - You ready? - Yes.

Thank you so much for coming. Everyone can head to the locker room. - Hanna. Hanna, right? - Yeah. I was watching you. You're pretty good. Thanks, but not as good as you, obviously. - Claire. Claire harris. - I know. Yeah, ben told me that you were trying out and made me promise to keep an eye out for you. Oh, you and ben are friends? Yeah. Close friends. Oh. Not like that. We got that out of our systems a long time ago. Trust me. We're just friends. But he's a good guy. For sure. Yeah, he is. Well, I just wanted to introduce myself. Maybe we all get together and hang out sometime, if that's cool. Yeah, I'd like that. - Awesome. Later. - Bye. Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there. So you're the new girl, right? Yeah, I made it pretty obvious, didn't I? We're both in the same boat. It's my first year too. I'm hanna. Hanna thompson. I know. I was told to look out for you. My father. Don't worry. He didn't say anything embarrassing. He was just being fatherly. That's typical, I guess. He can be a little overprotective. I'm sure, especially considering your situation. The move? I mean, your mother. Look, hanna, I was watching you. You're good. Very good. But I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you. It's your first year at lincoln, and you're a senior, so you have some things stacked against you already. Really? I thought I held my own pretty well, even better than some of the girls, honestly. That may be true, but... I really shouldn't say anything, but... Coach burke has admitted to me that she favors girls that had been with our program a while. So what are you saying? No matter how good I am, I have no chance? Not without a little help, I'm afraid. Hey, I don't know if you would be interested, but I could possibly give you private lessons. You're allowed to do that? Well, technically, I'm not supposed to. And you have to check with your father first. Yeah, yeah, it's just me and my dad. I know exactly what coach burke is looking for. I like you, hanna. I'd really like to see you make the team. And remember, this stays between us, okay? Yeah, okay. Good. I think it is a fantastic idea. Really? Yeah, of course. Why wouldn't I? I've always supported you 100%, babe. You'll be spending money on something I don't really need. Plus there's no guarantee I'd make the team. Well, it is the least I can do. I know you didn't have much say in moving out here and leaving all your friends behind. Even if it's just for a year, I know that that is extremely difficult. I have felt very guilty about the whole thing, so if there's anything I can do to make it easier on you, I'll do it. Thanks, dad. - Um, hey, dad? - Mm. Did you mention anything about mom to devan? Um, I don't know. I might have. I don't recall. Why? I don't know. It just... she sounded like she was trying to make me feel better about it. I don't know. Probably just trying to be nice. After all, it would've been your mom involved in this stuff, not me. Yeah, trying to relive her glory years. Hey, watch it. Your mother was an excellent cheerleader in her day. Besides that, how else was school? It was fine, I guess. - Your teachers any good? - Same in chicago. They all sounded like they'd rather be anywhere else. yeah, well, who could blame them? What about new friends? Any new friends? Ben introduced me to some people. They're cool, I guess. Ah. Ben. Old ben. Old neighbor ben. Mystery man. How is he? Is he a nice enough guy? - Yes, dad. - All right. Well, just because he's showing you around, introducing you to folks, doesn't mean you owe him anything. - Ew, dad, stop. - Well, it has to be said. I have to say it. I'm the only one here. Besides, if cheer is really as tough as it sounds, I'll be spending most of my time at practice anyway, so... Well, that's good then. I'm happy for you, devan, I really am. I'm glad because I intend to get to know him a lot better. You're very taken with him, yes? Yes, but it's not just him. It's his daughter as well. You've met her? Briefly, but... She reminds me a lot of myself when I was her age. Well, that may be true, devan, but we need to be cognizant... what? You just need to be sure that you are not repeating old, familiar patterns. What do you mean? I mean that your mother walked out on you. And you, more than anybody, know what it's like to be raised by a single father. And it's only natural that you would gravitate towards someone like his daughter, to protect her from what you went through. No, it's not like that. A lot of times we are not consciously aware of why we're attracted to someone. I said it's not like that! Okay, okay. I just want you to remember what happened the last time you were involved with a single father. I swear to god, jack, if I had to see the therapist for two more months, I'm really gonna lose my mind. Is that what they told you, two more months? At least two months. And as usual, they'll review the reports and see where we stand. I'll bet she cares about you, you know. What are you talking about? The therapist. I'm sure she cares about you. She's the shrink from hell. Just like I do. Jack, what are you saying? Promise me you won't get mad. As long as you're honest with me jack, I promise. Okay. Remember when you were sentenced? It wasn't just your therapist that was required to sign off on your progress. You had character witnesses too. Friends. I recently met with one of the caseworkers. She wanted to know how you were doing. And what did you tell her? I told her... Honestly, I told her that I thought you could benefit from some more sessions with dr. Gordon. I mean, your anger, your aggression, it's a lot better... I mean, much better. But I still think there's a lot of improvement or room for improvement. You're gonna try and improve me? Me? It's for your own good, devan. I wish you could see that. I just want what's best for you. We all do. You're not mad at me, are you? No. You only want what's best for me, just like you said. Now keep going. Come on. Nice. Push it. That's it. That's it. Okay, ladies! That's all for today! Practice is over! Except for claire. What's going on with you? What do you mean? If I don't see more energy from you tomorrow, you're not gonna have to worry about making captain. You're gonna have to worry about making the team. Got it? Okay. When I was cheering, I would've been embarrassed by a performance like that. You're lucky coach burke is a lot more understanding. Hey, you okay? No. Coach devan. If she goes up ms. Burke's butt any further, she'll turn into a hemorrhoid. - Claire! - No, I can deal with ms. Burke. I've known her for years, and her bark is way bigger than her bite. But coach devan, she's only been here for a few days and acts like this is her team. I mean, I guess. Plus she's totally sketchy. - What do you mean? - I don't know. She just gives me that vibe. Something's up with her. Hmm. I'm going home to lay in the tub. At least two-a-days are over, now that school has started. Oh, god. Can you two stop complaining? I swear, every time I see you on the practice field, you're just standing there. I bet we probably burn at least 10 times as many calories. For sure, yeah. Speaking of calories, you guys want to stop at nino's for a slice? I thought you just said you need to soak in the tub? I need energy for that. I'm in. Hanna, what do you say? Oh, I have to go home, unfortunately. I have an appointment. Next time though, I promise. Next time. Believe me, I would never criticize coach burke, but I've been spending a lot of time with claire these past couple of days, and nobody works harder than she does. Trust me. Coach knows these girls a lot better than we do. She can tell who's putting in the effort. I know, but she didn't have to talk to her like that in front of everyone. Hanna, I think it's really nice that you care about your friend, but right now you should be looking out for yourself. Come on. Let's practice the turnover cheer. That one gets tricky because of the splits. Okay. - Okay, one more time. - Okay. Oh, god. What a day. - okay? - Okay. Over. Good! That was really good. Hey, I think your dad is home. Oh, yeah. You want to go say hello? I'm sure he'd be happy to see you. Actually, we only have 10 minutes left or so. You stay here, practice the first-down cheer. I'll just run in, say a quick hello and then be right back. Okay. Hello, jon. Oh, hey. I'm so glad you agreed to this. Oh, of course. It would mean the absolute world to hanna if she made the team. Well, what about you? Me? Yeah, sure, of course. Mean a lot to me too. Uh, do you mind if I have one of those? I'm kinda hot. Oh, sure, yeah, follow me. Right this way. We should have some over here. Oh, as a matter of fact, this is the last one in that fridge, but I have more... uh, this one will be fine. Oh, uh, it's all yours. Thank you. Sure. Um, I'll tell you what. Let's see. I suppose that paying you in cash is going to be okay, huh? So hanna tells me you're overseeing a construction project. You must be really good with your hands. Well, you know, uh, I'm an architect. I'm okay with a t-square and use a protractor, but that's about it. Here you go. Thank you very much. Pleasure is mine. Oh, hey, there you are. I didn't know if you were coming back out. Sorry. Lost track of time talking with your father. Fantastic. Eh, we'll see. Uh, dad we're out of water. Oh, yes, I was just going to... you can have the rest of that, if you like. I will grab some more sodas and water from the garage. So how do you feel? - I think I'm ready. - Just do your best. Everything will fall right into place. - Promise. - I hope so. I gotta tell you, that crew you brought in, they did a great job. Really got us caught up. I appreciate it. Like I said, I felt bad. I'm glad we could make it right. Well, you can officially let phil know that he has a happy customer. Phil didn't send me. I wanted to come myself, just to see how you were doing. Oh, well, I appreciate that, too, 'cause I was thinking about those restaurants that you were going to recommend and thought maybe you might want to go to one sometime or meet there or something. Or maybe that's just way too forward. No. Of course I want to go out with you. really? I'm only laughing because I was kind of hoping you would have called by now. Why else do you think I'm here? To be honest, I didn't realize because, generally speaking, I am completely oblivious. Yeah, I'll say. If I left here today without an invite, I was gonna be forced to ask you. Oh, well, I assume you will be picking the restaurant then. - On one condition. - Yeah? I pick you up. I know the area, and I can show you around, instead of giving you directions the whole time. Wow. Dinner and a chauffeur. That is something I could get used to. Don't worry. I'll let you pick up the check. I can handle that. I should warn you. I'm not a cheap date. Um... Wow. Congratulations. You're the lucky few who made the team. I'll see you all tomorrow, and we'll start the real training. Coach burke? Yes, hanna. I just wanted to thank you. You have no idea how excited I am. The only person you need to thank is yourself. Trust me, if you didn't deserve it, if you weren't one of the best, you wouldn't be on the team right now. I know, but you helped me so much, you and coach walters. She spent hours with me, going over all the cheers and routines. - Hours? - Well, not here. What do you mean, not here? Uh, I mean I practice on my own, too, at home, by myself, alone. Um, she... You guys just inspire me. Hanna, is there anything you want to tell me? Just that I won't let you down, I promise. My girls never do. Congratulations again. Thank you. Hanna! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! Don't thank me. If coach burke didn't think you deserved it, there would have been nothing I could do. - But you helped me so much. - It's my job. Hey, you know what we should do? Tell your dad. He'll be so happy for you. Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely. I'm gonna tell him tonight, right when he gets home from work. Um, I'm gonna get going. I want to tell some other people the good news. And thank you, devan. Thank you so much for everything. I owe you one. - You made it? - I made it! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! How do we go out and celebrate? Absolutely! You grab claire, I'll get joey. That sounds great then. Thanks! Oh, what a day. I am exhausted. - What is it? - I made a team! - No! - Yes! oh, god, jon. Oh, and devan gave me a ride home. You should've seen your face. That's very funny. Congratulations, honey. I know. Isn't it wonderful? She's amazing. Um, dad, I know you probably wanted to celebrate tonight, but I'm going out with the girls from the team for dinner. Oh, yeah, sure. No problem. Don't worry about me. Okay, yeah, you're okay alone? - I'll figure something out. - Okay. Are there gonna be boys at this dinner? Um, I don't know. Maybe. Come on, hanna. I think your dad has a right to know. What boys are you going with? Honestly, I trust her completely. Don't worry about a thing. It's not really a matter of trust. It's about you being her father and wanting to know where she's going and with whom. I'm just getting pizza with ben, claire, and joey. It's okay. Hmm. I'll see you tomorrow, coach devan. Thanks again for everything. Have fun, babe. Remember, school night. I know. Be home early. Love you. So, about celebrating... - Uh... - How about a drink? Um, yes. I did restock the fridge. We can do either water or soda. I think the two of us can handle something a little harder, don't you? Well, to be honest, I don't keep alcohol in the house. In fact, I rarely ever drink, so... How about we go out and grab a drink then? A toast to hanna. You know, I really do appreciate everything that you've done for us here, but this, uh, I don't think this... Well, I don't know what "this" is, but I was just being friendly. With you just moving into town, I figured you might be lonely. Um, right. Well, um, no, I actually have plans this evening. That's not what you just told hanna. Look, whatever I said to my daughter really isn't any of your business. Now, um, I think that you are a lovely person, but... it's because I'm hanna's coach, isn't it? Uh, well, that's, that's one reason. So I help her make the team, I put my neck out on the line, for her, and this is the thanks I get? Um, first of all, we paid you to give her private coaching lessons, and hanna deserved to make the team. Now, as far as this goes, I just don't think that it is appropriate to mix any kind of business with... Pleasure, whatever you want to call it. And I don't want to give hanna the wrong idea. I bet I can change your mind. I don't think so. I have plans tonight you don't know what you're missing. what? Coming! Coming! Hey! Come on in, please. Usually I'm the one who's running late. You just can't believe what I had to, um... My goodness, you look... Stunning. Well, thank you. Now, what were you saying? Um, I completely forgot. oh, I'm running late. I'll... just give me two seconds. And make yourself at home. Drinks in the fridge. I'll be right back. So, hanna, what's the pizza like in chicago? Well, first of all, the cheese is an inch thick. So you're biting into an inch of cheese. - At least. - Hmm! I don't know. That sounds pretty good to me. Joey, anything sounds good to you. Okay, okay, guys, cut her some slack. She's still learning to call soda "soda." - what? - Wait, what do you call soda? Well, we call it "pop." look, all I'm saying is, if coach burke ever caught you biting into a pizza of an inch of cheese, you're definitely going to be running some sprints up the bleachers. What? I thought you said her bark was worse than her bite. It is, but that doesn't mean she's not tough. I had her once for gym. She terrified me. Okay, believe me, coach burke isn't the one you should be worried about. I did some more digging on coach devan. Yeah? What'd you find out? Well, do you know mandy fell? The sophomore. Tiny, but talented. I haven't met everyone yet. Well, you'll meet her soon. She actually made the team, and she was the captain of the freshman squad last year. But anyway, after the first tryouts, in the locker room, coach devan went to give her some advice. And then mandy rolled her eyes, or at least coach devan thought she did. I don't believe that. That girl's as quiet as a mouse. She was in computer science with me last year. I never heard her say a word. Look, it doesn't matter. Like I said, coach devan thought she did. So when she thought nobody was watching, mandy was on her way to the late bus, and... Coach devan gave it to mandy. What did she do? She started screaming at mandy in front of everybody, demanding her to give her some respect. And you saw this? No, kristen did. But she swears it's true. Look, she said that coach devan looked like something was wrong with her, like for real, like a mental patient. She sounds crazy. Yeah. Look, all I'm saying is I'm gonna keep my distance away from her because somebody like that could just snap... Again. So did you always want to be an architect? You know, work on those big projects? Thanks. Oh, no, not at all, actually. Originally, I wanted to be a fine artist, if you can believe that. I used to paint all the time. Well, what happened? Well, eventually, I realized that oils and acrylics are not nearly as lucrative as blueprints and lot more expensive to keep in stock. Yeah. no, I just realized after a while that there was not going to be a living in it for me, you know? Hmm. I can sympathize. I thought I was going to become a psychiatrist. I enjoy listening to people's problems and giving them advice, you know? But nobody told me that I would not only have to take chemistry, but pass it. Sure, sure. I guess we're a couple of successful failures. - To failure. - Hey, yeah. Failing upwards. Well, to be honest, I wasn't exactly devastated when I heard the news about the move. I mean, everything that happened, hanna's mother and all of that, I mean, I just think that she really needed a fresh start, even if it was just for a year. Just... Too many ghosts back there, you know? Probably for me too. I can tell that... There is nothing that ruins a first date faster than going on about your late wife. I'm sorry. No, no, it's okay. It's a part of you. Will you tell me what happened? Well, she, um... She passed away a little over a year ago. Cancer. And, uh... It just happened so fast. There was nothing they could do for her by the time it was diagnosed, except keep her comfortable, you know, until, uh... Until the end. But she, uh... She passed peacefully, so there's that. I'm sorry. Took some getting used to, I can tell you that. Haven't really had a good night's sleep in over a year, if you couldn't tell. Lost ten pounds I didn't need to lose, and, boy, the whole dad doing mom things, that was way out of my league. I mean, the first time my daughter asked me to pick up a face mask for her on the way home from work, I literally thought she was joining the softball team. No, literally. I thought it had something to do with sports. I had no idea whatsoever. It was just... Ohh... Well, from what I can tell, it looks like you're doing a fantastic job. Well, just one day at a time. That's what I keep telling myself, right? Ay yi yi. Enough about me. I mean, I am tremendously boring and in desperate need of a haircut. You, on the other hand, are the curious one here. What is your story? Well, I got married really young and then divorced. I guess nowadays they call it a starter marriage. But for me, the starter was all there was. And then slowly, my job just started becoming more important than my personal life. And now here we are. From where I'm sitting, this is not a bad place to be. Not too bad at all. Cheers to that too. what is she wearing? - What, her glasses? - Yeah. - She looks... - Like a librarian. I don't see coach devan carrying a book. Neither can I. I think they look kind of chic. Maybe for chicago. Hello, ladies! Hi, coach. Uh, I like your glasses. Thank you. You know, my father once told me it's impossible to turn down a woman in glasses. All right, let's get warmed up. We have a lot of work to do today. ♪♪ All right, great work. That's enough for today. Hit the lockers. - Hanna, how about a ride? - Oh, no, it's fine. I can take the late bus. Thank you though. Don't be silly. I'd be happy to. I wouldn't want to trouble you. It's no trouble at all. Come on. So I see you've made some friends on the team. All the girls have been really nice. I didn't expect that. Well, you just make sure that they're the right kind of girls. What do you mean? The kind that takes this as seriously as you do, who do it for the right reasons, who don't like to rock the boat. You know what we should totally do? Bring your dad dinner. Oh, I don't know. Oh, you already made plans? No. It's just we usually plan our dinners together when we're both home. Oh, even better. It'll be a nice surprise. Well, okay. Let me call him and see if it's okay. Like I said, it'll be a nice surprise. We're home! Oh, uh, miss walters, hello. You're... you're wearing glasses. You like? I just didn't realize you needed them. Why else would I have them? I also thought you would like some of that: Chinese! Hanna said it's your favorite. It has been... In the past. Mmm! Jon, you've got to try this mongolian beef. Um, yeah, I'm gonna pass. No, seriously it's some of the best I've ever had. Mmm! Yeah, uh, I think the answer to that is no. No need to get so angry about it, especially after I took the trouble to prepare it all. Well, that's just it, miss walters. Nobody asked you to. Is that what it's like in chicago? You have to be asked to do something nice? Oh. Really feel sorry for you guys. Miss walters, hanna and I appreciate everything that you have done for her so far, but I think it's probably time for you to go. Jon, don't be silly. We haven't even had dessert yet. No, come on. Maybe I'm not making myself clear. Uh... I don't want to see you again. And outside of your position as my daughter's coach, I don't want you to see her again, especially outside of school. Now, is that clear enough? if you could just trust me, jon, you'll see that I know best. You know what's best for my daughter, huh? Unfortunately, I do. I told you I was also raised by a single father after my mother walked out on us. There's not a day that goes by that I don't miss her. So I know, more than anyone, the problems that occur in a single-parent family. But lucky for you both, I'm willing to be in this for the long haul. I'm sorry, in what? Your lives. Yeah, but we don't want you in our lives. As a matter of fact, as of right now, we don't even want you in our house, so, please, go. How dare you! After everything I've done for you, after everything I've done for your daughter, this is how you treat me? All right, that's it. Just, uh... Leave, all right? Just go. Go! Go. Out. what was that? I have no idea. That lady is out of her mind. Look, I promise you, babe, I will take care of this. Okay. Maybe I should at least let the school know. Oh, no, dad, please don't. That's the last thing I need. I mean, everything is going well, and then the new girl's father complains about the cheerleading coach? No, no, please don't. I gotta do something. I mean... And then it'll come out that we hired devan for private lessons. All right, maybe... Maybe I just let the head coach know. That's an even worse idea! We have no idea how coach burke will react. She could easily throw me off the team. Dad, please promise me you won't do anything. Okay. For now, I will not do anything. We will just see how this plays out, but back off of her. Have as little to do with her as humanly possible, okay? Okay, I promise. All right, all right. ♪♪ ♪♪ hanna thompson, what are you doing? I was doing the routine. You were phoning it in, that's what you were doing. Being on the squad means you have to work even harder, - not rest on your laurels. - I wasn't. And don't interrupt me! You forget which one of us is the coach. The way you're representing this school is a disgrace. Practice is over. Wow. That was a little much, coach walters. Sorry. I've just been watching her lately. She's not taking it as seriously as the other girls. It's making me furious. That's for me to decide as the head coach. Yes, ma'am. And why all this focus on hanna? You've never been like this with any of the other girls, and hanna wasn't performing any worse than any of them. I guess... I guess one reason is she reminds me of myself. Well, whether she does or doesn't, you know how I run my team. All members are to be treated with respect. That means all cheerleaders and coaches. Got it. Hanna, hanna. That bitch! She can't talk to me like that. Okay, just calm down and take a deep breath. She humiliated me in front of the entire team. She did not humiliate you. She humiliated herself. Trust me, the whole team got your back. Coach burke just stood there. Well, that's because coach burke is old school. But I'm sure she's not happy about it, I can tell you that. Thanks, claire. I don't know what I would do without you. Yeah, that's what friends are for. Now let's get back out there. I need someone who can actually dance. Hello, hello! there you are. uh-oh. What is it? It's devan. Miss walters. Yup. What did she do? She's gone too far this time. She's crazy. I assure you, mr. Thompson, the well-being of our students here at lincoln high, especially the girls on my cheerleading squad, is of the utmost importance. Of course they are. I just appreciate you being so responsive. I promise you, I am not one of those parents who just swoops in every time his kid has some kind of, you know, adversity, but this situation just... it really... Shook her up. I can't go into details, as that would be a breach of confidentiality, but I can promise you, I will deal with the situation. Matter of fact, I was there when it happened. - Well, uh... - And I can also assure you that I nor anyone on my staff are trained to deal with our student athletes that way. Well, I just... Thank you again. And on a happier note, I really want to personally thank you for having hanna on the team, the squad, whatever you call it. she certainly earned it. Well, I just appreciate it very much. It's gonna make her transition into this new school so much easier on both of us. Yeah, well, I can relate. I'm an army brat. Ten schools in twelve years. Oh! Can't imagine. Okay, well, thanks. I appreciate your time. You're welcome, mr. Thompson. You bet. Before you leave, does hanna have any idea what she think might have led to this episode? Uh... - Can I be candid with you? - Please do. You gotta promise me you won't hold this against hanna after I tell you. You have my word. Uh... Well, I guess I took it upon myself to hire miss walters to give hanna some private lessons. Cheering lessons. - Private lessons? - Yes. So that she could get a leg up on the competition. I heard how tough you could be as a coach. When exactly did this happen? Well, that would have been the lead-up to the tryouts. - At the school? - No, no, no, no. They didn't train here at the school. No, it was actually at our house. At your house. I know that it was probably not the best idea. I just didn't see anything in the rules against it. But I think that's where she got kind of infatuated with me. And I put... I put it strongly down that that was completely not okay, and that it was totally... Unprofessional. I ended up severing the working relationship there as well. How did miss walters react to that? Uh... Not well. I appreciate you telling me, mr. Thompson, and I can assure you I'm well aware that most parents will do almost anything to help their children. Hi, coach burke. Hi, coach burke. Hey. Hi. Coach walters, a word? If this is about yesterday, I was completely out of line. - I know that. - Yes, you were. And I won't allow that to ever happen again. You're absolutely right. I'm embarrassed about it. You have to understand. This job is very important to me. I just wanted to make sure the girls were taking it as seriously as I am. Trust me, no one takes this job more seriously than me. But there's a right way and a wrong way to discipline our cheerleaders. And when I hired you, I thought you understood that. I did. I do. It won't happen again. - You have my word. - Good. That's not what I wanted to talk to you about. It's been brought to my attention that... You've been giving private lessons? Was that wrong? I had a long discussion with the vice principal about it. And although it's not technically wrong, I think you know it's something that I wouldn't approve of. I'm sorry. I have a reputation for running a squeaky clean program, and if it got out that one of my coaches was giving private lessons, it would appear as though we're giving preferential treatment, and I can't have that happen. I understand. It's just... hanna needed me. The other girls needed your help too. Hanna didn't just need a coach. She needed a mother. Be that as it may, I don't want to hear anything else about private lessons. - Got it? - Got it. Thank you. I'm just shocked that you wanted to spend the weekend with me, especially here at work. Why? I'm curious to see where you've been going every day. Besides, ben has to go with his parents to visit his grandfather. He lives in a retirement community. Ah. You really like this guy, huh? You met him. What do you think? Well, I'm not the one dating him. Yes, dad, I like him. Ah, just remember. There's no reason to hurry into anything. You only just met. I know, dad. Besides, if I'm being honest, that whole devan thing really freaked me out. Yeah, yeah, well, I think that's over now, sweetheart, you know? - Thank god. - And granted, she is definitely missing a few tools from her shed, but I don't think that she's crazy enough to jeopardize her job over this. I sure hope not. But there is one thing that I've been wanting to talk to you about. Well, if it's what I think, mom already had that conversation with me in eighth grade, so we don't have to go there. Oh, no, not... no, no, not that. No. It's just, I... Well, I met someone, you know? A woman. Here? Already? She actually works for the construction company as a project manager. But turns out she's a foodie, too, so we met for a couple of dinners while you your friends were out. For real? Yeah, yeah. I just didn't know how to approach this with you. I mean, I haven't been alone with another woman since your mother passed away. I didn't want to upset you, especially with everything else that's been going on. This crazy stuff. You like her? Oh, I mean, I'm just getting to know her, but yeah. She's... She's really cool. Well, I can't wait to meet her. You deserve to be happy, dad. That's what mom would think. As long as it's not devan. Hey, now, that I can promise. I swear, he had me go from my bedroom door to my bathroom, swinging around like some kind of tree sloth. That doesn't sound like your father. - Ask him! - Look, I... I thought that she was faking it. In my defense, you know, I just figured that she had some kind of test or something she was trying to get out of. I mean, who's ever heard of synovitis? Synovitis. I don't even know how to say it. - Syno-what? - Exactly. It's not that serious. Only lasts a couple days. But my legs wouldn't work. And she will never let me live it down. Nope. You want to hear some great stories though? This one right here. I gotta tell you. Oh, yeah. Some of the stuff that you have dug up when you're breaking ground on a new site? Oh, she doesn't want to hear about those. - Yes, she does. - Tell me! There's one about the forensic archaeologist. That one. Okay, that's a pretty good one. It's a long one. I will tell it when I get back from the ladies' room. - How 'bout that? - Oh, the suspense! Suspense! Uh, dad, I think I just saw devan spying on us. What? Here? I mean, her hair was tucked underneath her baseball cap, but I know how she walks. Sure it was her? She was right there. Who else could it have been? How have things been with her at practice? I mean, actually ever since you talked to coach burke, she's been completely ignoring me. It's pretty weird. God, I wish they could have just fired her. That's what I wish. It's the way that lawsuits are nowadays and all. You can't fire anybody anymore. What are we gonna do? I don't know. If she was spying on us, that is just straight-up creepy. All right, just... Don't say anything about this. - Okay? - Okay. - hey, how are you? - Okay. So the story, it's a pretty good one. What do you think? You believe me, right? Of course I believe you. We already knew she was nuts. Yeah she's nuts, but is she crazy? I mean yelling at me and the other cheerleaders, completely losing it, that's one thing. But stalking me and my dad at that restaurant last night, that's a whole other level of unstable. It's scary. You're right, but what can you do about it? That's what I've been thinking. I mean someone who's crazy, you gotta figure they've done something before, right? I guess. That's what we have to find out. What do you mean? Come on. Have a seat. How about you take a break from this? You want my dad to take his power sander to you? I thought your dad liked me. He does, but if he catches you in here with his only daughter, trust me, the honeymoon is over. Look. Look at this. What? Well, when coach burke introduced devan to us, she said that she was the team captain of the cheerleading squad at plainfield junior college. - The one right up the coast. - I guess. Okay. So? So this is their website, and it says right here that janet hughes, their head coach, has been there for ten years. So she's been there when devan was there. Exactly. And I'm guessing you want to pay her a visit. You're pretty smart... For a football player. Finally! Sorry. I got ready as fast as I could. By the time we get there, she's not gonna be there anymore. Probably not. What, you're the only one who can play detective? Is that her home address? Pretty smart for a football player. Let's go! hi. You hungry? So hungry I forgot to eat. well, I'm just wrapping up things here at the site. We can grab a bite to eat. Actually, I have to run over to one of our properties. I'm meeting someone, but it shouldn't take too long. I can meet you at the restaurant? That's fine with me, if that's all right with you. Hanna coming too? No. She's got early dinner plans with her friends and then they are going to the library to study after. Oh, the library. I remember what that meant in high school. - Don't remind me - okay, okay. I'll call you when I'm on the way. Okay, sounds good. See you then. - This is it. - Okay, let's go. hi, can I help you? Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but are you coach hughes of plainfield? Yes. My name is hanna thompson. I'm on the senior cheerleading team at lincoln high. This is my friend, ben fremont. Hi. We were hoping to talk to you about devan walters. Devan walters? What would you possibly want to know about her? She's my assistant coach. So? What is it that you want to know? Well, what can you tell me about her? Well, she was definitely a dedicated cheerleader. She was great to the squad. She was a great leader, and we were happy to see her graduate, but sad to see her go. Ah, hell, what did she do? Well, she's been verbally abusive to me and other girls on the team, but we have reason to believe she might actually be... Dangerous. Devan came to plainfield right after high school. She was incredibly talented and an incredible problem. She became close with another cheerleader named krissy riggins. She came from a divorced family, and she lived with her dad, and her dad was super cool. He was always around. All the girls liked him. - He was just a nice guy. - Mm-hmm. And then, um... Things got complicated. Devan fell in love with him, didn't she? I wouldn't call it love. I would call it an obsession. Oh, my gosh. That must have caused quite the scandal. It might have if there was any hint that krissy's father had acted inappropriately, but there wasn't. But the problem is devan didn't care. She didn't care. She was gonna make sure it looked like he did. She'd threatened him that she'd go to the police and accuse him of sexual assault. - Was he worried? - Anyone would be. At the end of the day, look at the story. It's totally feasible that the dad falls for his daughter's friend, especially one who looked like and acted like devan. Did he go to the police? He couldn't. He was stabbed to death. And the police, they called it robbery because he didn't have his wallet. You don't believe that, do you? Look, guys, I've already said too much to you. But please just promise me. Leave her now and never say I told you a thing. We won't say anything. Hmm. be careful. Just down the road. Oh, my god. Are you okay? Oh, I think my modeling days might be over, but I'm okay. This is all my fault. No, hanna, don't be ridiculous. No, you don't understand. Honey, honey, I already told her everything. She knows all about it, even some stuff I didn't mention to you. Like what? Well, uh... A couple times while you were practicing with miss walters, she came inside and, uh... I don't know, I mean, she came on to me, and I told her that's not happening and completely inappropriate. I just didn't mention it to you 'cause I didn't want it to become awkward for you. I just figured she would get the point and go away. We have to call the police. We already have. They're on their way right now. Did you see anyone? It just happened so quickly. As soon as I looked up, the car was right there. I didn't see anyone behind the wheel or anything about them. Yeah, she hit her head pretty bad. It's amazing you weren't hurt a lot worse. Yeah, well, thankfully I had the presence of mind to just roll under a car as soon as I hit the ground. That's what saved me. You must be exhausted. Let's get you some sleep, huh? Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Mm-hmm. Okay. I think those painkillers are starting to kick in. Oh, really? Save me some. - hi. - Hey. So where were you today? Oh, at home. We were just... me and ben were studying and doing some research. Nothing crazy. Hey, detective sherman. Great to see you. - That's my daughter, hanna. - Hi. Do you want me to wake her up? She just laid down. Let's let her sleep. Unfortunately, there's nothing she needs to hear immediately. What do you mean by that? Did you guys talk to miss walters? We spoke to her, yes. And what did she say? That she was home all night. Well, that's obviously not true. A friend of hers was there when we arrived. That friend confirmed that they watched television together all night. We have no reason not to believe her. That's not possible. I know that this isn't what you want to hear, but that young lady in there can't remember a single detail, not even the type of car that struck her. Could be anything from an suv to a mini cooper. And mr. Thompson, what you told me before about devan walters' behavior, I'll admit it's strange, but we can't go around locking people up just because they're acting a little odd. - What about for murder? - Of course. But I already told you that... no, this is something that I just found out today. You don't know about this. When devan was in college, she was a suspect for the death of her ex-boyfriend. Okay. Was she tried? Convicted? - No. - Was she even arrested? They questioned her, but there wasn't enough proof. I'm afraid that's exactly what we don't have here: Proof. But what about the death threats and the spying? It's all circumstantial. It's not even enough for a warrant. And if we did bring her in for questioning, even a semi-competent public defender would have her out in minutes. Okay, let me get this straight then. We just have to wait around until this lunatic attacks one of us again? Now that I've spoken to her, she's on our radar. I really don't think she'll try anything else. But what if she does? I know that this isn't the answer you want to hear, but unfortunately, you can't really do anything else. Devan, I have to ask. Is there something wrong? Why would something be wrong? Well, we've been sitting here for almost an hour, and I have a feeling you haven't heard a word I've said. I've heard you. It's the same old crap. Excuse me? I said it's the same old crap, isn't it? My father cheated on my mother, my mother walked out on us, we learn by watching, so we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes as our parents. Okay, well... I think we're done for the day, devan. Mm, did I hurt your feelings? Like I said, I think we're done for today. devan, that's completely inappropriate. Ooh, you are angry. hey, coach, you have fun last night? I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, sure, you don't. If I were you, hanna, I'd watch yourself. It'd be a shame if something were to happen to you. Oh, like what happened to derek riggins? How do you know that name? I know all about him, devan. I know you think you might have gotten away with it, but you won't get away with what you did to melissa. That, I can promise you. Walk away, hanna. That's the kind of person you are. But I would never walk out on you. And your father knows that. I just don't understand. How could the police not do anything? They don't have enough evidence, apparently. At this point, it's her word against ours. It's almost like they need someone else to get killed. Tell me about it. - Ah, shoot! - What? I forgot my keys in the locker room. How could you do that? I'm not used to having the car. My only dad let me have it because he's taking care of melissa. Do you want me to wait for you? No, it's fine. Go ahead. I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. See you later. - Bye. hanna! Ben! Hanna! please, devan. Put the knife down, so nobody gets hurt. Oh, you're really not in any position to be giving orders, are you, ben? Please, devan, it's not too late. We can all still be together just like you wanted. Just like my father wanted. No! It's too late for that, hanna, just like it's too late for your father and that bitch girlfriend of his! Just like it was too late for my mother when she walked in on my father and that whore. looks like I hired the wrong cheerleader coach. suspect is on foot. Disappeared from scene at approximately 1700 hours. Suspect is a tall white female. I don't get it. How could she have just gotten away? There are many ways to escape this place. Oh, come on. She must have gotten away while the emts were checking her out. Well, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't still be alive. Okay, so now what happens after this? Won't be much longer.
