- Rufus. Come here, boy. - Rufus. Rufus, stop playing around. Come on here. Oh my God. Rufus, where you at? Oh, Rufus. What happened? - Hey, Jessica. I thought I'd find you here. - Hi, Kathy. Just when I think I'm out of tears, you know. - It's okay. Nobody's judging you. I miss her too. - You know, everybody says it gets easier, but I don't think that's true. - It does, eventually. Everybody grieves differently. All those self-help books you've been reading are just ideas. You're the one who has to actually do it. - So, what brings you here? I'm sure you didn't come to hear me catch Mom up on current events. - The last bit of business from your mom's will. - What's going on? - The inheritance for your Aunt Susan. - What do you want me to do with this? - I haven't been able to get ahold of her or your Uncle Lawrence in a while and someone needs to drive out to the farm. - What? You want me to do that? - It could be a real nice trip. Take Sam with you. Make a weekend of it. - I don't know, Kathy. I don't think I'm up for that type of socializing right now. Maybe you could put it in the mail? - Oh, no. It's too much money to trust to the mail. Besides, you should be with family right now. You know, get away for a few days. How long has it been since you've seen your aunt and uncle? - Honestly, since I was a kid. It's hard to stay in touch. - So, go rebuild that connection. Your mom may be gone, but you still have family out there. - When was the last time you talked to them? - A few months ago when we were settling the will, but they haven't been answering their phone in a little while. You know how country folk get about technology. Well, anyway, I left a message saying that you'd be coming out for a few days with a check, so it shouldn't be a surprise when you get there. - Thanks, Kathy. I'll think about it. I promise. Well, that's just irresponsible. What is? - Why would you ever make out a cashier's check for that much? - That's a lot of zeros. - I know, right? - Did you know your mom was sitting on this kind of money? You could have hired a nurse with that, take some of the strain off of you. - Yeah, she would have hated that, having to let someone see her vulnerable and struggling. No. She took care of us. Anyways, I got to spend more time with her the past few months than I had in years. She was my roommate. My best friend. - You sure you're ready to do this? We can take some more time. You can try and wire the money to them. - This is their money, so we need to get it to them. - You sure? Do they even want it? What do you mean? - I'm not trying to be a jerk here, okay? I just, but think about it. You barely know 'em. They didn't once offer to help. They didn't bother to show up for the funeral, and now, suddenly, you're just gonna show up and hand them a bunch of money. - It kind of feels like a reward for bad behavior, huh? - Exactly like that. Why should you give them this? - It's what Mom wanted. - Yeah, you're right, and that whole other thing. - What thing? - You hate the country. - I don't hate the country. - Yes, you do. Every time we have to drive outside the city limits, you start complaining about the bad food. - This is family. It's not some poorly planned camping trip with you and your friends. - Hey, that poorly planned camping trip was a milestone in our relationship. Besides, now we all know what poison ivy looks like for sure. - But they're still family. I'm sure they'll be happy to see you regardless. - You know you don't have to come with me, right? - I've got more vacation time than I know what to do with. It'll be good to get away for a bit, get some fresh air. Maybe drink some lemonade on a porch swing while somebody plays banjo in the distance. - Thanks, Sam. I love you. - I love you, too. ...that were shot and killed that day. We appreciate you taking time to spend with us. Please make sure you subscribe on the socials. That was pretty good. I mean, it could have been shorter by a couple episodes. Jessica. Jessica! Sorry, what? - I asked if you wanted to pick the next podcast. You okay? - I think it's just sinking in that we're doing this. It's not too late to turn back. - No, we're not turning around. I just hope they got my message. - You still can't get ahold of 'em? - No. I tried again at the gas station and still nothing. What if they're out of town? - I don't think they get out much. - It's just a lot. I feel like I'm about to meet 'em for the first time. - Come on, babe. I mean, you've told me all about 'em. - But those are childhood memories. What if the people I'm remembering are from some commercial I saw when I was eight, and not actually them? - I think you're getting yourself all worked up over nothing. - Right, maybe, but it's hard to not overthink this. I'm just saying that, until there's something to be worried about, there's nothing to worry about. Just focus on rebuilding the relationship first. Everything else is secondary. - I suppose you're right, and if it gets awkward, we can just leave. Exactly. Besides, if you want to be worried about something, it should be about us getting lost out here. The cell service is sketch. - That's not a bad thing. No notifications for a few days sounds nice. - Yeah, except, if podcasts have taught me anything, it's that pretty city people like us go missing in the country. Years later, they find our bones in the compost or folded up in the trunk of a car. This must be the place. At least I hope so. - Here we go. - Hello, little Jessica. Oh, come here. - Hi, Aunt Susan. It's been awhile. - I have missed you so much. Oh, I am so sorry that we could not come down for the funeral. I mean, we really wanted to come, but it was so close to the harvest, and then we had an irrigation leak, and we had to bring in a water truck while the lines were being fixed, and then, out of nowhere, a pipe burst, and then it was this whole back and forth thing with the county. I'm sorry, you don't care about any of that, and there's plenty of time for that later. Right now, I'm just so glad you're here. I missed you too. - Yeah. - Well, what a pretty sight. - Hey, Uncle Lawrence. - My, my, my. You certainly have grown up. We don't even have a picture of you in the house from the last decade. Get in here. Give me a hug. - It's been a while. - Yeah. Good to see you. - Hi. I'm Sam, Jessica's boyfriend. - Hi, Sam. Lawrence. How do you do? - Hi, Sam. I'm Jessica's aunt, Susan. - It's a pleasure to meet you two. I've heard a lot. - Well, let's get inside and get reacquainted. - Yeah. - I'll get those bags. You gotta understand that you guys got here a little bit sooner than we expected, but that's perfect. You can unpack, freshen up, and then we'll sit down for some good, old-fashioned country cooking. Something smells good. Well, make yourself comfortable. Eat. Oh, you didn't have to do all this for us. - Oh, this? This was nothing. - It doesn't smell like nothing. It doesn't taste like nothing either. I just, I'm blown away. How'd you have time to do all this? - Oh, don't worry about the food. Feeding hungry souls is the Lord's work. - Amen, reverend. - How was your ride here? Any problems on the road? - No, there was some traffic this morning, but smooth sailing otherwise. - Yeah, once you get out of them unholy cities, things start to look right decent. - Don't start that again, dear. - I'm just saying, cities, you know, that's where crime is. That's where the bad stuff happens, you know? I mean, you can look that up. It's a fact. - Oh, come on, Uncle Lawrence. The city isn't all that bad. - You put that many people in a small space, bad stuff is bound to happen. Now, out here, I've never had a raccoon trying to steal my wallet. - No, you put a little puppy chow in that wallet, I'm sure the raccoon would be after it. - No, ma'am. Thievery is a man's invention, not the Lord's intention. - You've never seen an animal steal? - I'm just saying, there's not a creature out here that matches the wickedness of a man's heart. - Maybe we should just wash up a bit first. - Where are my manners? You two must be exhausted. Why don't you go, freshen up, unpack a little, and then we'll sit down for a good, old-fashioned country meal? - Yeah, that's a great idea. Unpack a little, have a nice proper dinner. - Thank you for the spread. - Yeah, follow me. I'll show you where you're sleeping. Right this way. We got y'all set up here on the right. Yup, here you are. Deluxe accommodations. Sammy will have to move a couple of them boxes off the bed there, and the bathroom's just down the hall here. What? Y'all thought you were gonna be sharing? Uh-uh. You're not married. - Technically, no, but-- - But nothing, young lady. Y'all can sin under your own roofs, but this here is my home and I don't tolerate no hanky-panky under my roof. This is a house of the Lord. And you, you ought to be thanking my dear Susan, 'cause if it wasn't for her standing up for you, you'd be sleeping on the couch. You hear me, mister? - Yes, sir. - And I don't want to see this door closed neither. Now, I'll see you downstairs for dinner. - Oh, he seems nice. - I'm just glad he didn't ask us to sleep in separate rooms. - He might as well have. - Mom always said they're old school about sex. - Seriously. So, now that we're here, how long do you want to stay? - Are you ready to leave already? Grumpy ol' Uncle Lawrence scared you that much? - I'm not trying to leave, certainly not before dinner. I'm just curious is all. - I don't know. Is it weird to want to play it by ear and see how it goes? - Not at all. - I just don't want them to think we came here just because of the money. - I get that. - I wanna live in the moment for a minute. - Of course. Do you have one of those USB wall things? - Maybe in the car. - I'll grab it later. You feeling okay? - I'm just a little anxious. - It's gonna be just fine. We can stay as long as you want, as long as Lawrence keeps cooking. Give 'em the money when you feel good about it. - Thanks, babe. No cellphone service is sketchy. I hope they have cable. Otherwise, it's gonna be a long trip. - I don't know. No distractions. No appointments. No football. Clean air. The sound of the birds. - And the bees? - Okay, later, Farmer John. - No, no, no. - It's time to eat. - Okay. Here you go. Here, Jessie. - Jessie. No one's called me that since I was a girl. - You're still a girl. - I mean a kid. - I'm sorry. It's just old habits. Jessica. Sorry. - Whoa, easy there. - We still gotta say our prayers. Oh, I think that's a wonderful idea. Yeah. Don't be shy. Heavenly Father, we pray to you to thank you for this wonderful meal we're about to eat, this delicious food, the gifts coming our way, and our, and our family, and, uh, and, uh, for all of the wonderful things uh, in, in, in this life. Um... Uh, in your name, we pray. Amen. Amen, amen. Let's eat. Dig in. - Oh, uh, yeah, can I have another plate? - Well, now, somebody is hungry. - Actually, I'm a vegetarian. - Oh, sh- Pardon my French. Um... Well, how long have you been a vegetarian? - Pretty much my whole life. - Oh, really? - It's fine, Lawrence. I'll just grab a new plate. - Oh, no, no, no, you stay there. You're our guests. I'll grab one. - I'm sorry, Jessica. It's just, it's been so long. - It's okay. Mom and I were always reminding people. - Oh, that's right. - Right, yes, yes. Betty was a vegetarian too. - Vegan. Mom was vegan. - Uh, a veg-- Oh, yes, a vegan, and why are you not? - Well, I was for a while, but I think I'd die if I had to give up cheese again. - Well, listen, you do not hesitate to ask if you need me to make you something else, okay? It is not a problem. - No, there's salad and potatoes. I'm perfectly fine. I promise. - Okay. - I guess you two have quite a bit to catch up on. - Well, every journey starts with a single step, right? - Well, all right. Here you go, Jessie. - Thank you, Uncle Lawrence. - Yeah, and as luck would have it, I found something that I forgot to remember in the kitchen. - Have a little red with your greens. I don't imagine y'all run into many vegetarians around here. - No, no. I mean, Lawrence calls salad rabbit food. What I have to do just to get a little vegetable in his diet is astounding. - Now, hush. I got a whole bunch of grapes right here. - That's fruit, honey. - Well, all right. Cheers to that. - So, how's the farm going? It looks great. It's so beautiful here. - Thank you. You are a real sweetheart for saying that. Yeah. I think the best part is the view. Yeah, you just don't get that in the city. - I'll say. Out our window is just another apartment. Sardines in a can. - I suppose, but it's really not that bad if you get to know your neighbor, kind of build a community, seeing people in the office, in the parking lot. Yeah, I don't need to know my neighbors. I'm fine with my neighbors being across the street. I like 'em as far away as they can be. - Doesn't the good book say something about know thy neighbor? - Well, I don't mind knowing my neighbor as long as they're across the street and behind a locked gate, you know. - I suppose no one's gonna be knocking on the door asking for sugar any time soon. - Well, it's not that I don't like people. I like people just fine, but this is my house. This is my farm. This is my kingdom. If I want to make plans, if I want to see someone, then I'll see 'em in town or something, but I don't want someone coming over here, knocking on the door, asking for something. - Jessica, why don't you tell us what you remember about this place? It's been so long since you were here with your mom. - Oh, um, not much, really. Mom had a few photos. so I guess that's where the memories live. She talked about this place a lot, especially towards the end. I'm sorry. I really miss her, and, you know, really, not a day goes by where I'm not thinking about her, or you. - Oh, thank you, Aunt Susan. That really means a lot to me. It's not been easy, but it's getting a tiny bit easier each day. - So how long have you two been living in sin? Lawrence! - It's just a question. - Well, that depends, I guess. - A while then. - I don't think that's a topic we need to discuss at the dinner table. - I completely agree. - We're abiding by your rules while we're in your house. - Damn straight. - But I think maybe we should avoid talking about politics. - Well-- - I think that's a wonderful idea, hm? Yes? I know you two just got here and we're just from different walks of life, but I would really hate for that to get in the way of us getting to know each other. Right, dear? - Yeah. So, let's all eat and then we can all get a good night's sleep, okay? - You asleep? - No. - I'm sorry that didn't go better. - It's okay. Honestly, it went better than I thought it would. Was I out of line at dinner? - No. Your uncle was out of line, and he knows it. He's just a little rough around the edges. He asked if eggs were okay for breakfast. - I love eggs. Sounds great. Says he's gonna get them fresh for you. - Fresh eggs? - Well, technically he said, "Still warm from the chicken," but I translated that to mean fresh. - Gotta love the country. Uh, what do you think you're doing? - Moving the stuff off the bed so I can crash? - No, not over there, you're not. - Uncle Lawrence said-- - Well, he can have his opinion. Doesn't mean we have to stop being us. Besides, we're adults. - Well, heads up, my feet are freezing. - Lucky for you, I'll warm you right up. - Good morning. - Well, by the way you were looking at them trees out there, I didn't think you were ever gonna come back in. - You saw that? - Well, just while I was out rustling the eggs. It's beautiful, isn't it? - Extremely. - Coffee? - No, thank you. There you are. - Oh, sorry. I took a walk. - Sam, would you mind helping Lawrence finish up in here so us ladies can go outside and catch up? - Sure. Yeah. - This way. - How are your kitchen skills? - I order a mean pizza. - That's about what I figured. Why don't you grab me a cup of coffee? - That I can do. - Now, about last night-- - Forget about it. Really, it's no big deal. It just caught me by surprise. That's all. - Lawrence, he is so set in his ways. - I promise it's fine. - Okay. Fresh start? One day at a time, right? - Fresh start. One day at a time. - On a different note. I want to apologize to you and Betty for not being there for you, in the end and after that. - It-- it-- - Aunt Susan-- - No, I really want to say this. Betty and I... Betty and I drifted apart. I don't think either of us intended it to happen. I loved her. I love her. But, you know, relationships take work, and I stopped putting in the work, and then it just became easier to keep our distance, and then it started to seem like work to rebuild, and so that became a wall between us, and you're the only family I have left, and I don't want something like that to keep us apart. - I'd like that. - It's okay. You are always welcome here. - Thank you. - You always have a place here with us. - That sounds wonderful. I could really use some extra family time right now. - Yeah. It just goes to show you, you never know what's gonna happen. - Don't you start crying too. - Oh, God. I'm sorry. Well, sweetie, don't make the young lady cry at the breakfast table. I know. I didn't mean to have an emotional breakfast. - Well, speaking of emotions, I, uh... I'm sorry about last night. I can be a bit adversarial sometimes. - No need to apologize. I could have handled that situation a lot better. Really, Lawrence? - What? I didn't see you on your hands and legs, crawling around the chicken coop, grabbing huevos this morning. - So, how long have you two had the farm anyway? - Well, I couldn't really tell you exactly. It's been a while. What would you say, Susan? What do I say? Yeah. - I'd say that the days are long but the years are short. Now, I want to hear about you two. Now, how long have you two been dating? I mean, it must be serious for you to drive up here together. - Yeah, I noticed one of you didn't make their bed this morning. - Oh, Lawrence, relax a little. I swear, the second men retire, they get insufferable. I don't have enough work for him and he becomes nosier than a nun in someone else's confession. - You hear that, baby? You don't get to quit working. He's nosy enough already. I am not. - Oh, you most certainly are. The other day, I saw him going through our neighbor's trash. - Ooh. - They did not separate their recyclables. Look, on a completely different topic. I heard a story the other day about how farms are becoming less profitable due to water licenses. Well... you need water for farming. I think it's mostly an issue is what crops are historically grown, where coupled with the cultural expectations of those same communities and the industrial processes that have become entrenched surrounding them. - Oh, yeah. Mm-hm. - Yes, mm-hm. - Yup. Babe, that's really insightful. - I mean, it's from a podcast. I find agriculture fascinating. - We don't do much farming anymore. We're kind of retired, you know. - I didn't figure the two of you for retiring. Mom said you loved working with your hands. - Well, I mean, you know, it gets to the point where you don't work if you don't have to. - I get that. - Sam, now, what do you do for work, and how are you gonna support our niece? - Aunt Susan. - Yes, give us some little grand nieces and nephews running around. - I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves. - Yeah. That is a far way off. - Well, I wouldn't exactly say that after last night. - Really, Lawrence? - You need to stop wandering off. I can't help it. It's so nice to be able to just walk around and not worry about anyone or anything. It's nice not to hear helicopters every night. Yeah, and that dumpster smell. Well, maybe there's a little bit of that city smell here. - It's different. There's supposed to be crap on the ground out here. Well, either way, all that sex talk at breakfast got me thinking. - Gross. That made me think the exact opposite! Come here! Come here! Good news, bad news. The bad news is the only place that gets any sort of cell service is the sort of top left corner in the living room. - The top left? - Yeah, by the couch, by the window. Well, the upside is no distractions, so the whole focus is still on you. - Is there a downside? - Now, a downside is there's nothing stopping your aunt and uncle from keeping on me about kids and marriage. - Everything's certainly simpler out here. Nothing to worry about except what you can see. No pressure. No bosses. - Oh, crap. I got a bar. It's the clinic. Oh, come on. Just a little bit more. - Go use the phone inside if it's so important. Hi. Can I help you? Now, who are you? - I'm Jessica. Who are you? - Jessica. That's a new one. Yeah, you must be new to the crew. Fresh blood is always good, I guess. - Oh, sorry. I don't work here. - Yeah. No one works here. - Perks of retirement. - Retirement? What the hell are you talking about? - They're retired. They don't work on the farm anymore. - Hold up. Just what do you think this place is? - My aunt and uncle's farm. - Aunt and uncle? - Yeah, I'm just visiting. - Family. Wow. Yeah, I never saw that one in the cards. So, which one of these are you related to, huh? - Both of them. - By blood? - Oh, no, my aunt. My mom's sister. - Julie. - Susan. - Who the hell is Susan? - Hey, buddy! What are you doing here? - There he is. Hey, I was just having a real interesting conversation with your niece over there. Oh, are you? Yeah, she's staying with us for a couple days. Do not start that with me. - There you are. I've been looking all over for you. Now, come on. - What was that about? - You said I could lay low here. - Yeah, I know what I said, but I also said I needed you to cut out your usual crap. Give me a break. You expect me to believe that you bought all this stuff? - Will you relax, pops? Besides, when did you have a cute little niece? I mean, she is cute. - All right, stop it. Just cut it out. I need you to listen to me right now. You need to leave, okay? - Hell, I mean, I just got here. So I guess I'm staying. - All right. Fine. Park the car around the side with the other ones so you're not out here in front like a jackass. - Jackass. Yes, sir. Jackass. - Jerk. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Come on. Almost. Geez. Well, that was graceful. Oh, I didn't know these things still exist. - Hi, Susan. - My name is Kathy Simpson. Well, as you know, we read the will today, and Betty left quite a bit to you and your husband. Call me back so we can coordinate the transfer. I wish you could have come down for it. What are you doing? - Huh? What? Nothing. Not doing anything. - Stop snooping around. - I'm just surprised these things still exist. Besides, anyway, this confirms now there's a phone around here somewhere. - Who wants pie? - Oh, pie sounds wonderful. Sam, give the phone a rest, okay? Come have some pie. - Pie sounds nice. - Yes, it's about to get much, much cooler, so... - Really? - It's a good time for y'all to come visit. I see you broke out with the pie already. - A little afternoon snack. - Seriously, though. Where did you learn to bake so well? - I worked in a kitchen up north 100 years ago. - Up north? - Yeah, yeah. Practically Oregon. - Is your friend joining us? - Who, Kurt? No, he took off. Yeah, he crashes with us when he's on the outs with whatever little filly he's been horsing around with, but, I'll tell ya, he's better off alone. Well, I hope he didn't leave because of us. We wouldn't mind more company. - Oh, no, trust me, no. He's not good company when he's like this. - I just don't want him stumbling back here later. - I made it very clear. - You better have. - Very. - Low battery. Excuse me. I just gotta grab the charger out of the car. - Jessica, would you mind joining me for a moment? I've got something I want to show you. - Sure, Aunt Susan. Hey, Hank, we got a call that the general store on Mill was robbed a little while ago. - And here I was trying to enjoy my coffee. Who's the closest unit? That would be you, boss. - Crap. Anybody hurt? No, but he sounds pretty shook up. - All right. I'll go check it out. Another day. - What? Great. I guess it's better than nothing. Super. Okay, come on. I know it's a lot of stairs. All right, now, I believe it is somewhere over here. Oh, yes. There it is. Now, I remember your mother used to pester my mother, your grandmother, about this all the time when she was a little girl. - Mom was stubborn. Oh, yes, she was. We used to sit on the front porch and watch the sunset and she would say the twilight would get caught in here and make it sparkle forever. I only thought of it when I saw you on the porch earlier. Betty loved this necklace, and I would love for you to have it. See, the older you get, the more you gotta look at what you've done in the past and what you're gonna do in the future. - What do you mean? - Well, I guess I mean that I don't want to look back at this moment in a year and have any regrets. I can't change the fact that I wasn't there for Betty. That's something I'm gonna have to live with for the rest of my life, but... you taking that necklace sure does make it a little less bad. Well, Aunt Susan, relationships are two-way streets. It wasn't all your fault. - I guess it didn't feel that way. - Well, I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere. - Oh, look at me, getting all emotional again. - Oh, I get it. I felt the same. I mean, I love my mom, and it was so hard seeing her like that. - Cancer sucks. - Cancer sucks. - I also know what it feels like, to feel like you don't have anyone to depend on. I don't want you to feel that way. We're here for you, your uncle and I, no matter what. - Thank you. Dead men don't open doors. - Hey, it's okay, kid. Everything's fine now. - It's not fine. The store was robbed. - But all that he got was the money in the drawer, right? $273.18. Your father is not going to beat you over $273.18, yeah? - Easy for you to say. It's probably coming out of my check. - You know, if that's the worst that happens, it's no big deal. - Not a big deal? Hank, he pointed a gun at me! Whoa. Calm down. All I'm saying is it could have been a lot worse. You get to go home, safe and sound. - I guess. - You guess? Guess what else? It's gonna be a pretty good story to tell the ladies, huh? - Yeah, I suppose it is. - Jessica. Jessica! Jessica? Oh, thank God. 911, sheriff's station. - He killed someone. I need help. Sir, are you in danger? - Yes. There's a killer here. - Okay. - It's important to remain calm. - No, no. Calm people always die in the podcast. The panicked people, they live and they get the cops! Can you tell me where you are? - Yes, I'm at the farm! The farm? - Don't you have GPS? It's a farm! That's not how it works. - It's a farm. It's just off the 16. There's a lot of trees. Old general store, a beat-up old general store nearby. - Hello? Hello? Jessica! Jessica! I was so nervous coming up here. - What were you nervous about? - Well, I mean, we hadn't seen each other in so long. I didn't know if you were a different person, if I was a different person, if we would get along. I'm just so relieved you two are still here. - Oh, yeah. - We're still here. - I've been going to Mom's grave, telling her about all the gossip and the current events. I was just scared, you know, going on without anyone in my life. - Well, you have Sam. - No, I mean, like family, like real family. - Well, we got you, Jessie. Come on. - Actually, I have something to give you. Jessica! Jessica! Oh, Jessica. Thank God you're okay. - Sam, what happened? - Look, we gotta go right now. - What are you talking about? - No, we gotta go right now! - Sam, you're scaring me. - Look, it's Lawrence. He killed that guy, the guy in the car. - No, no, you got that wrong. - How would you know? Did you notice he didn't mention anything about God or faith when he came back in for pie? That's because his brain was too full of murder thoughts! Look, we gotta go, like right now! - Okay. - Susan, do you have the keys to your car? - The keys are in the kitchen. - Look, we can take ours. - No, no, no. The battery's dead. - Since when? - We gotta go! Come on! Wait up! Come on. - Sam! - Sam! - Go, go, go! Oh, God! Come on! Come on! - What? - Go, go! Is there any other way out of here? - I don't know. Baby, you're scaring me. What is happening? - I saw a dead body, okay? And Lawrence was trying to destroy the evidence with a bottle of bleach! - Okay, don't jump to conclusions about my husband, but, you know, if Kurt did hurt someone, then we should call the police. - The phone's dead. - Look, Lawrence is uncouth, but he would never kill anybody. - Honey, I need you to trust me on this before we become the opening on next month's episode of "Farm Towns and Body Dumps!" Sam, I think you're under a lot of stress. And I think you are far too calm right now. - And I think you are far too panicked. So let's just come back here and calm down. Then we can find Lawrence and figure out what's going on. - Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh. - Now, tell me again. - What happened? - It's not much, really. He came in, grabbed a case of beer and a pair of sunglasses. I thought he was going for his wallet. He pointed that gun at me. I don't remember much after that. I must have emptied the drawer for him. Really, I was just relieved that he left. I came down here and hid by the scratchers until you got here. - Damn, Ben. That sounds all kinds of harrowing. - You know, stuff like this isn't supposed to happen out here. - Yeah, you're right. It's crazy what's going on in the world today. It's not supposed to happen. Now, listen, can you describe him for me? - Yeah, he had light brown hair, and it was short on the sides, you know? His goatee was going gray at the bottom. - Yeah. It always starts at the chin. - He was thin. He had a real angry feel about him, like a coiled up snake. Hank, you out there? - God, it never ends. Go for Hank. We got a call, a potential homicide. - Murder? Are you sure it's not just some kids playing a prank? Not sure, but first the robbery and then this? Seems like an unusually busy day. - You can say that again. The call dropped before I got a location. The caller ID'd an old farm off the 16 near the general store that got robbed. Hold that thought for a minute, Darlene, okay? Just calm down. I guarantee you he isn't coming back here anymore. Thanks, Hank. - Now, work on that story for me, all right? Those ladies are gonna love it. - I'll try. Ha! Look at you. All right. Thank you. - Yeah. Hey, Darlene, it sounds like the Freeman farm to me. I'm gonna go check it out. Listen, you better call the rest of the boys, and if this thing gets any bigger, we could use the help. Copy that. I'll get on it. Oh, and, Hank, be careful. So, why don't we all just calm down and we can find Lawrence and figure out what this is all about? - Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh. - Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh. I don't hear him anymore. Sam, this is ridiculous. - Aunt Susan? - Yeah, that's nothing. - He's coming. - Sam, wait! - Sam! - Damn it, Brandon. What took you so long? I was having trouble stalling. Well, you got what we need. He knew we were working something here. Unless you suddenly wanted to cut him in, I had to make a choice. - Oh, yeah, so you and your quick thinking you ruined the best dang thing we had going. Well, we've been sitting around here forever. I mean, you know, I was getting kind of antsy. - Oh, you were getting antsy, so you blew the biggest score we had in years? You're an idiot. - I'm not an idiot, and we still have the score. And enough bodies for a football team, and don't forget what we had to do to get this place. We've been dodging the authorities for months. look who's awake. - Oh! Hello, Jessica. Hello. How are you? Are you feeling good? Okay, great, so everything's gonna be just fine. - Hey, Aunt Susan. What's going on? - Well, we know you got a big pile of money for us, so why don't you just tell us where it is? - I already told you two we didn't bring it! It was supposed to be wired to you! - Stop using that line. We know you're full of it. It's the truth! - You keep trying to play hero, that truth is gonna get yourself hurt. Hey, look at me. I said look at me! - Leave her alone! - Hey! Just tell me where the money is and then we'll be gone. We don't give a damn about this farm. You will never hear from us again, and nobody else is gonna get hurt, so where is it? - Where are they? - Who? My aunt and uncle. - I think you're worried about the wrong people. - What did you do to them? - Brandon. - Do it. - Yeah. - No! No! - Don't touch her! Leave her alone! Yeah, these oughta work. These are good. - Simple. - Stay with me, okay? - Look at those man hands. - Get off me! Get off me! - Yeah, looks like somebody gets himself a mani-pedi at the old salon. Why don't we save you some money next time around? - No, no, wait, wait! - Stop! - Stop? Yeah, we got company. - Just stay with me, okay? Stay with me. Ah, they found us. - No, listen, we don't know that. Get out there and handle it. Fine. - And, you guys, we're gonna play the quiet game, okay? Or else things are gonna get real messy in here. Shh! Shh! - Howdy. I'm looking for Lawrence Freeman. Do you know where I can find him? - At your service. There any trouble around here recently, Mr. Freeman? - Well, if you count the lack of rain. - The heat does bring out the crazies. Yeah. The reason I'm coming around is we got a call from someone saying they might need a little assistance. - Huh, well, it's been quiet as a church on Monday around here. - Understood. Just the same, you mind if I take a look around? - Oh, not at all. Be my guest. - I told you to be quiet, okay? Isn't that what I said? - Jessica, run! Get out of here! Where you going? - Where are you going in such a hurry? Don't you want some of this? You couldn't just play nice, could you? - Don't move, Freeman. - Sheriff. You are tougher than you look. - Yeah, I get that a lot. Oh, thank God. - You all right, missy? - I am now. - I'm gonna need you to put the weapon down. Put your hand on your head. - Weapon? Oh, my farm implement. - Best get up and get over to the house. - Sheriff, there's another one in there. - Yeah. I don't know why you're doing this to yourself. It's not like it's your money anyway. - It's not your money either. - I think you're misunderstanding your situation. I don't care about you. I don't care about this house. Stop it! The only thing I care about is that money, and the longer you take to give it to me, the more upset I get. The more upset I get, the more terrible things I'm gonna do to you. - Where's Jessica? - Playing outside with Brandon. - If you hurt her... If you would just give me the money, then we could go! Stop that. Stop it. - What is with all the noise? You're complaining about this? I'm hearing gunshots out there. - Let me go! - Did you hurt her? - Nah, Chipmunk's fine. You that's in a world of hurt. - Yeah, he seems to think there's something chivalrous about keeping the money from us. - Oh, that's stupid. - Screw you! If I give you the money, you'll kill us. You watch too many movies. You give us the money, we disappear, or you can not give us the money, we beat you very badly, and then we disappear. I mean, that seems like an easy choice to me. - Aunt Susan. - Just let me go. Just let me go. - Would you just be quiet? - Okay. - No. Shall we begin? Let's have a little conversation, shall we? Samuel Richards. I bet money that you'd be one of those candy-asses that went by Sammy or something, but, my baby, she had you pegged as a Sam from the get. That's why she's the brains of the operation. I'm just the good looks. So, let's see here. You graduated in 2016. You're a registered nurse. Wow, congratulations. That is impressive, Samuel. And look at this. Here's the answer to the million-dollar question. You've been dating for a year and a half. Couldn't even share that with us at the dinner table. All right. Mom, dad, brothers. Okay, so your whole family lives in San Diego. You have a cat named Montgomery. What is it with kids these days? - All right, come on, baby. Come on. Stay on task. - No, no, no. - Alright. So... here's how it goes. I'm gonna ask you a series of questions. For every question you answer incorrectly, you will lose a finger, and when you run out of fingers, things will get nasty. - Please don't. Please don't, no. No, no! - It's here. It's here. The cashier's check is in Jessica's bag. - Sam, that wasn't so hard now, was it? Yes. - All right. - Yes. - Oh, shoot. Little Miss Emotional is going for the cruiser. - I'll get her. - No, Brandon, just leave her. We can take the check and we could be outta here. - Oh, to hell with the check. I'm gonna go stick that chipmunk. - Damn it! Car trouble? - Screw you! - Oh, with pleasure. - Where is it? Oh, God. Okay. - Why are you doing this, huh? I know that you killed my aunt and uncle. For what? For some dumb inheritance money? - Oh, they were dead long before we knew about the inheritance money. We needed a place to lay low and we found this house. Nice and secluded, off the main road. A couple of people who didn't have many friends. The inheritance money, well, that was just... that was just a happy accident. - A happy accident? You're monsters! - It's not my fault the youngsters don't check in on their elders anymore these days. - Come on. Come on. - I'm gonna make you a deal, Sammy, okay? I don't want to kill you. I mean, more bodies, more problems, honestly, so I'm just gonna leave you tied to this chair. I figure it's gonna take the police like four or five hours to get here, and then, when they come in, I want you to just have amnesia about my appearance, okay? - Deal? - What's the point? Even if you don't want to kill me, do you think Lawrence is gonna let me live? - I'm about to go grab him and we're gonna hop in the car and we're gonna be like dust in the wind, or I could just take care of this right now. No, no, Jessica won't go along with it. - Why don't you forget about her for a second? - Where is she? - She is being tended to by Brandon. - What do you mean? - It means that I need you to make a choice right now! Jessica! Wrong choice. So, what's the plan, sweetheart? Are you gonna stay in the car all night? Why don't we just get this over with? I promise I'll be quick. - Screw you! - Ooh, still feisty, I see. I like that. This oughta be fun. Come in, sheriff. You out there? Help, help! - Hank, you out there? Please, please, please! - Someone help me! - Hank? - Someone please help me! No, help. No, no, no, no, no. What's fricking happening? You know you love me. - You two, you couldn't do it the easy way, could you? You just couldn't eat and get out. - You gonna shoot me, hm? - If I wanted to shoot you, I already would have. - Then what are we doing here? - Well, I'm gonna take the money and go. I don't care what you do. You little idiot. I was gonna let you live, huh? Come out. - You're running out of bullets, Suze, if that's your name! They're gonna find you. - Oh, Sammy boy. Why don't you stay back there and think about what you've done? - Jessica. - Knock, knock. - Jessica. Jessica. Don't come near me. - Why? What are you gonna do to me? - Don't try me. - That's all I want to do. You know, I really oughta thank you. You are just so much more fun than your aunt was. - You're an evil pig. - Is that supposed to hurt my feelings? - You killed an innocent couple who did nothing. It was the only family I had left. You have no feelings. - Oh, but I do. Come here. Let me show you. - What's with the scotch? - It's, you know, for whacking stuff. Oh my God. I thought you were dead. - Thanks for not giving up on me. - Never. Looks like help is finally coming. - I'm not sure what there's left to help with. - Well, maybe they caught Susan, or whoever she was. - Maybe. - You're sure about your aunt and your uncle? - They're gone. - I'm sorry, babe. - It's okay. I don't think I have any tears left to cry today. - You sure you're okay? - I will be. - I love you. - I love you too. Um... How long do you think it's gonna take to figure out what actually happened here? - I imagine this place will be a crime scene for a while. - So much for the farm. - You disappointed? - Absolutely not. You? - I think we're definitely gonna end up on a podcast about this. Copy 22, this is 10-6 on 187. 22, be advised your 10-15 came back wanted in multiple states under multiple aliases. 22, copy.
