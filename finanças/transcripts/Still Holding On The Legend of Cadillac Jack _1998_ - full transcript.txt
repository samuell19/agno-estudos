LEMBECK COULDN'T PROVE IT, SO THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD REALLY DO, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. HE SHOULDN'T BE GETTING AWAY WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS. I DON'T WANT A JUVENILE DELINQUENT ON MY HANDS BY THE TIME HE'S 10. - ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. - I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE A TALK WITH YOUR SON, A SERIOUS TALK. - OK. I'LL TALK TO HIM. - THANK YOU.

FOR NOW, I'M GONNA TELL YOUR MOM I GAVE YOU A GOOD SCOLDING. YOU BETTER NOT TELL HER ANY DIFFERENT, YOU HEAR? - NOT IN THIS LIFETIME. - OK. HERE. LET'S THROW SOME ROCKS. HERE YOU GO. TRY THAT BIG ONE THERE. THERE WAS 3. - CHESTER ANDERSON, SIR. - I'M DISTRICT ATTORNEY EARL WIGGINS, AND THIS IS DEPUTY SHERIFF GERKER FROM BOSSIER CITY. WE DROVE A LONG WAY TO GET HERE.

NOW YOU HAVE TO KNOW, I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS. - WE KNOW THAT, NESTOR. WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT? - WELL, THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO EXTRADITE HIM TO LOUISIANA. - WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? - ACCORDING TO THEIR COURT PAPERS, THEY HAVE AN EYEWITNESS. - WHO HAPPENS TO BE A CAREER CRIMINAL. - HOW CAN THEY TAKE A CRIMINAL'S WORD OVER A MAN LIKE MY HUSBAND? - IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE. SMART CONS TRADE JAIL TIME FOR TESTIMONY. YOU FACTOR IN IT'S A ELECTION TIME IN LOUISIANA, AND STRANGE THINGS HAVE A HABIT OF HAPPENING. - I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN TO BOSSIER CITY. - LOOK, GUYS, I'M YOUR FRIEND. YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONVINCE ME, BUT YOU NEED TO GET YOURSELF A LAWYER AND FIGHT IT. - HEY. I FOUND ANOTHER BOX UNDER THE BED. HOW ARE WE GONNA FIND ANYTHING IN ALL THIS MESS? - IT'S IN THERE SOMEWHERE, OK? DON'T WORRY. IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT. - I KNOW. I'M JUST SCARED. - WELL, WE'RE LOOKING FOR MY APRIL ROAD RECEIPTS. IT HAPPENED ON THE 16th. IF WE FIND THOSE, THEN WE'VE GOT MY ALIBI. - DON'T SAY THAT. YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE YOU NEED ONE. - WELL, I DO. - OH, WAIT! OK. HERE'S ONE FROM A RESTAURANT IN LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS. - OH, GOOD. THIS IS THE BOX. LET'S LOOK THROUGH HERE. GAS--ENID, OKLAHOMA. - GREAT. I'LL TAKE IT. - THAT'S ALL WE NEED RIGHT THERE. - THIS IS SOME BOOKKEEPING SYSTEM YOU GOT HERE. - HEH HEH HEH! - WHAT'S SO FUNNY? - WELL, I JUST--I JUST FIGURE WHY WAIT TO LOOK BACK AND LAUGH AT SOMETHING WE CAN LAUGH AT NOW? - YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND ENJOY YOURSELF. - YEAH. I GOT THEM IN FRONT OF ME. ON THE 16th, I WAS IN A RESTAURANT IN ARKANSAS, AND I GOT TWO MORE THAT PUT ME IN OKLAHOMA LATER THAT DAY, SO IT'S OBVIOUS I WAS HEADED THE OTHER DIRECTION. YEAH. WE CAN CLEAR IT UP THEN. I'M A MAN OF MY WORD. I EXPECT YOU'RE THE SAME. I'LL BE THERE. - WHERE? - I'M GOING TO LOUISIANA. - WHY, JACK? WHAT HAPPENED? - I MADE A DEAL. - WHAT KIND OF DEAL? - WELL, SHOW THEM THESE RECEIPTS, THAT AND PASS A LIE DETECTOR TEST, HE'S GONNA DROP ALL THIS NONSENSE. - WAIT A MINUTE, JACK.

I LOVE YOU. - I LOVE YOU. - ♪ GOT MY GUMBO ♪ ♪ BRING MY CRAWDAD CUP... ♪ - THANK YOU, DARLING. - I THINK WE GOT OUR MAN. I GOT A WAITRESS WHO WILL PLACE FAVOR WITH ANDERSON AND HIS PARTNER. I GOT ANDERSON'S EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY. - I NEED A LITTLE MORE CORROBORATION. FIND ME THE PARTNER. - UH, EXCUSE ME. DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S AN ATTORNEY HALSEY HERE? - UM... OH, THERE HE IS. - LEON HALSEY AT YOUR SERVICE, MA'AM. - HI. - YOU WANT TO HAVE A SEAT UP HERE, AND WE'LL HAVE US A TALK. - SURE. LET'S DO. - I--I AM SO SORRY I'M LATE, MA'AM. I WAS HELD AT THE COURT. - OH, THAT'S OK. I, UH, I'M TOLD THAT YOU PEOPLE PRACTICE PEOPLE A DIFFERENT KIND OF LAW HERE. - WELL, YES, MA'AM. MATTER OF FACT, OUR SYSTEM IS BASED ON NAPOLEONIC LAW, WHEREAS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS BASED ON ENGLISH COMMON LAW. - WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT. - OK. MISS FAVOR, YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THIS IS A--WELL, IT'S A UPSETTING CASE AROUND HERE. - MM. BEING AN ELECTION YEAR AND ALL. - OH, YES, MA'AM. AND THE CASSETTS WERE WELL-LIKED. HOWEVER, I HAVE NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT A JURY IS GONNA SEE IT JACK'S WAY. YOU HUNGRY? - OH, NO, SIR. I'M FINE. - DID YOU BRING THE MONEY? - YES, SIR, I DID. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD THIS WAS. IT'S EVERY PENNY I COULD SCRAPE TOGETHER, AND THE REST OF IT WAS RAISED BY JACK'S FRIENDS. I SURE HOPE YOU'RE WORTH IT. - DEAR PONDER, I'M SORRY TOMMY'S TAKING THIS SO HARD. THERE'S JUST NO WAY I'M GONNA LET HIM SEE ME CAGED UP LIKE THIS. ATTORNEY HALSEY SAYS WE'LL BE GOING TO TRIAL SOON. I SURE HOPE SO. I'VE RIDDEN THIS HORSE ABOUT ALL I CARE TO. AND I MISS YOU, PONDER. I COULD TELL THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU YOU HAD THE RIGHT ANSWER TO MY QUESTION--"YOU THINK YOU COULD EVER LOVE A COWBOY?" - "ABOUT AS MUCH AS A BROKEN HEART." - HEY, TUBBY. IF ME WORKING HERE IS GONNA BE CAUSING YOU TROUBLE, I CAN GET A JOB SOMEWHERE ELSE. - AW, DON'T PAY THEM ANY MIND. THEY AIN'T GOT THE SENSE GOD GAVE A GOAT. THEY'RE EATING HERE, AREN'T THEY? HA HA HA! - YOU'RE A REAL FRIEND. - NICE AND HOT. IN CASE YOUR WONDERING, I AM MRS. JACK FAVOR AND PROUD OF IT. - ONE HAND WASHES ANOTHER IS THE WAY I SEE IT. LOOK OUT THERE. YOU SEE HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE WHO HELP US? - SO I WALK FREE JUST LIKE HIM? - OH, HE'S NOT FREE. HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE TO LOOK OUT OF BARS. - YOU MAKE AN AWFUL CONVINCING ARGUMENT, MR. WIGGINS. - GOOD. SO I CAN COUNT ON YOU TO BACK UP YOUR PARTNER'S TESTIMONY AGAINST FAVOR? - YOU KNOW, MR. WIGGINS, I AIN'T A GOOD MAN. THAT'S HOW COME I KNOW ONE WHEN I MEET ONE. NOW I LOOK AT YOU, AND I SEE MYSELF, JUST A DIFFERENT KIND OF CROOK, THAT'S ALL. - DON'T YOU TRIFLE WITH ME, BOY. - I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GOT SUCH A THING FOR JACK FAVOR. THE MAN IS SOLID GOLD. KNOW WHAT ELSE? I'D SOONER SWALLOW A LIVE SNAKE THAN TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE. - GET HIM OUT OF HERE. - LET'S GO. - BURN IN HELL. - WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO WITH HIM? - OH, TAKE HIM TO TEXARKANA, SOMEWHERE WHERE HALSEY CAN'T GET AHOLD OF HIM. - THINK WE OUGHT TO GO TO THE JUDGE? - WHY? - THE GUY MIGHT BE INNOCENT. - RIGHT NOW, WE GOT ANDERSON VERSUS KELLY, ONE CRIMINAL'S WORD AGAINST ANOTHER. - SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS, WHICH LIAR DO WE BELIEVE? - LOOK. EVERYBODY KNOWS JACK FAVOR, BUT HIS POPULARITY HOLDS NO SWAY WITH US. THE VOTERS ARE GONNA KNOW THAT WE'RE JUST DOING OUR JOB AND THAT NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW. AND IF HE'S INNOCENT, THE JURY WILL SET HIM FREE. KNOW WHAT I MEAN? - YOUR CASE IS COMING ALONG. JUST A HITCH OR TWO WE NEED TO VISIT ABOUT. FOR INSTANCE, YOU NEVER TOLD ME, JACK, THAT THAT CAFE ON OUT THERE IN ARKANSAS WAS COLORED. - WHAT THE HELL DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE? - SON, I MARCH A COLORED WOMAN IN THAT COURTROOM, PUT HER UP ON THE STAND AS YOUR ALIBI, I CAN PROMISE YOU, KNOWING THE JURY POOL IN THIS TOWN LIKE I DO, IT'S GONNA HURT YOU MORE THAN IT'S GONNA HELP YOU. I AIN'T GONNA DO IT. - WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE GUY AT THE GAS STATION? - EH, HE'S JUST SOME VAGRANT PICKING UP A FEW BUCKS ON HIS WAY OUT TO CALIFORNIA. OWNER PAID HIM IN CASH. GOT A NAME HERE BUT NO KIND OF FORWARDING ADDRESS. - THOSE RECEIPTS ARE ALL I HAVE TO PROVE THAT I WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT DAY! - I STILL INTEND TO OFFER THEM INTO EVIDENCE. HELL, BOY, IT'S ALL WE GOT, THAT AND YOUR WORD. - JACK FAVOR IS A MAN WHO THINKS HE CAN HIDE BEHIND A SHINY SILVER BELT BUCKLE, A MAN WHO THINKS HE'S BETTER THAN YOU AND ME, BEYOND THE LAWS THAT GOVERN US ORDINARY FOLK. HELL, HE'S A CHAMPION RODEO COWBOY, BUT WHAT THE PROSECUTION WILL PROVE IS THAT HE'S NO MORE THAN A THIEF AND A KILLER, WHO BELIEVING THAT THE CASSETTS HAD A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF CASH AT THEIR STORE ON THE DAY OF APRIL 16, ENLISTED THE HELP OF TWO VAGRANTS AND IN A DRUNKEN RAMPAGE BRUTALLY AND MALICIOUSLY MURDERED TWO GOD-FEARING PEOPLE. SO I WILL ASK EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO LISTEN TO THE EVIDENCE AND RENDER THE CASSETTS THE JUSTICE THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU. - "THINKS HE CAN HIDE BEHIND A SHINY SILVER BELT BUCKLE." FOLKS, I THINK MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE HAS SEEN "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD" ONE TOO MANY TIMES. JACK FAVOR DON'T NEED TO HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING BECAUSE HE CAN STAND PROUDLY BEHIND HIS WORD. WHAT THAT MAN THERE REALLY WANTS Y'ALL TO DO IS TO BELIEVE THE WORD OF A CONVICTED CRIMINAL, A KNOWN LIAR, AND A THIEF, WHO HAS ROBBED AND ASSAULTED ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. - YES, SIR. THEY TOOK THEIR TIME EATING, AND I DO REMEMBER. I DID SERVE THEM BEER, A LOT OF IT. - IN 20 YEARS IN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, THIS WAS THE MOST BRUTAL CRIME SCENE I EVER SAW. POINT BLANK. ONCE IN THE HEAD, ONCE IN THE CHEST. - THE BULLET ENTERED JUST TO THE LEFT SIDE OF MISS CASSETT'S NOSE AND CAME OUT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE OCCIPITAL BONE OF HER HEAD. IN BOTH CASES, DEATH OCCURRED INSTANTANEOUSLY. - MY JOB IS WHAT WE CALL A JIGGER. I STAND WATCH, YOU KNOW, DRIVE THE CAR. NOW JACK FAVOR AND VERNON KELLY, THEY COME UP ON MR. CASSETT WHILE HE'S ASLEEP. JACK--HE PUTS THE GUN TO HIS HEAD. HE SAYS, "WE COME FOR YOUR MONEY. SHOW US WHERE IT IS...NOW." WELL, I WENT OUTSIDE TO STAND WATCH BY THE FRONT DOOR. HEARD SOME BREAKING INSIDE. THEN I HEAR 3 GUNSHOTS. JACK--HE COMES BACK THROUGH THE DOOR, AND HE SAYS... JUST ANOTHER DRY HOLE. - YOUR HONOR, AT THIS TIME, THE DEFENSE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER INTO EVIDENCE RECEIPTS WHICH PLACE MY CLIENT ELSEWHERE AT THE TIME THE CRIME TOOK PLACE. - UNLESS THE DEFENSE HAS THE PEOPLE WHO MADE OUT THOSE RECEIPTS IN THE COURT TO VERIFY THEM, I'M GONNA HAVE TO OBJECT. - WELL--WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS, JUDGE. UNLIKE THE STATE, WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GO CHASING OFF AFTER FILLING STATION WORKERS AND THE LIKE THAT GO FROM JOB TO JOB. - OBJECTION SUSTAINED. - JUDGE, THESE RECEIPTS ARE INTEGRAL TO OUR CASE. - GET ON WITH YOUR CASE, MR. HALSEY. - YOUR HONOR, CAN I AT LEAST SHOW THE RECEIPTS TO ESTABLISH THAT MY CLIENT WAS TRAVELING FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES? - DO THOSE RECEIPTS HAVE DATES ON THEM? - THEY DO, YOUR HONOR. - THEN HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT WITHOUT VIOLATING MY ORDER? - ALLOW ME, YOUR HONOR. I THINK I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU HERE. - WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, BOY? - THERE YOU GO. - [LAUGHTER] - WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, JUDGE? - THE ONLY THING I HAVE ARE THOSE RECEIPTS! - IMPROPER PROCEDURE! - JUDGE, I DEMAND A MISTRIAL! - DENIED! PROCEED. - IN ALL MY 40 YEARS OF PRACTICING LAW, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE! THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE MAN YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THE BAILIFF PUT THE HANDCUFFS ON. TAKE HIM OFF TO THE JAILHOUSE! - I'M GONNA CHARGE YOU BOTH WITH CONTEMPT! - THEY PAINTED A HORRIBLE PICTURE OF YOU OUT THERE, JACK. - I GOT UP THERE, AND I TOLD THE TRUTH. THEY GOT TO SEE THAT. - THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TRUTH. IT'S LIKE THEY'VE JUST BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO COME ALONG AND PIN THIS ON. JACK, THEY WANT TO SEND YOU TO ANGOLA. DO YOU KNOW HOW BAD THAT PLACE IS? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA? OH, BABY. I JUST WANT US TO WAKE UP FROM THIS NIGHTMARE. - SO SAY YOU ONE, SO SAY YOU ALL? - GUILTY. - Y'ALL GOT TO BE CRAZY! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU PEOPLE? - OH, MY GOD, JACK! - ORDER IN THE COURT! MR. FAVOR, I REMAND YOU TO THE CUSTODY OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. - OH, GOD! - WE WILL HAVE ORDER IN THIS COURT! - HE DIDN'T DO IT!

WHY DID YOU ATTACK ONE OF MY GUARDS? - HE WAS BEATING A DEFENSELESS ANIMAL. - HE WAS BREAKING A HORSE. THAT'S HOW WE DO IT HERE. - THEN YOU DO IT WRONG. - YOU GOT A MOUTH ON YOU, FAVOR. - YOU GOT CONVICTS DOING YOUR ROADWORK, COOKING YOUR FOOD, MAKING YOUR FURNITURE. WHY DON'T YOU LET SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING HAVE AT YOUR HORSES? - AND THAT SOMEONE, I PRESUME, WOULD BE YOU. NOW WHY EXACTLY WOULD I DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT? - BECAUSE I'M THE BEST YOU GOT, AND YOU KNOW IT. - CRACKED THAT HOOF. - NAH. IT'S OK.

UM, LEG OR WING? - OH, NOTHING, THANK YOU. - YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU. WHEN I FIRST AGREED TAKE OVER HALSEY'S CASES FOR HIS ESTATE, I WAS PULLED UP SHORT BY YOUR HUSBAND'S TRIAL. I HEARD THAT THE PROSECUTOR ACTUALLY WENT INTO THE JURY ROOM WHEN HE FOUND OUT THEY WERE HAVING TROUBLE REACHING A VERDICT. - WELL, CAN'T WE USE THAT AGAINST THEM FOR AN APPEAL? - YES, MA'AM. - THAT DEPUTY--HE GIVES ME THE CREEPS. - YEAH.

THAT'S WONDERFUL. I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS, TOO. YOU KNOW THE ATTORNEY WHO FINALLY TOOK OVER ALL OF HALSEY'S OLD CASES? I FOUND HIM, AND HE'S AGREED TO HELP US. HE SAYS WE'VE GOT MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR AN APPEAL. WE DID IT, JACK. WE FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE TO LISTEN. - YOU DID IT. YOU NEVER QUIT ON ME. - QUITTING WAS NEVER AN OPTION. AND I STILL WANT TO BE YOUR WIFE. - YOU ARE MY WIFE. ALWAYS. AS SOON AS WE GET IT UP AND RUNNING, THE RODEO, I WANT YOU TO BRING TOMMY. - OH, JACK. HE WON'T BELIEVE ME!
