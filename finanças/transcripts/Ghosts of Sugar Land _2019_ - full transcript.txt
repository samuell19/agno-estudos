[birds chirping] [mask 1 breathing heavily] -[indistinct chatter] -[child shouting] [mask 2] Is there a red light that tells me it's recording? [interviewer] It's recording. [mask 2] What am I supposed to call him? [interviewer] Uh, let's call him... -[mask 2] Mark? -[interviewer] Steve. -[mask 2] Steve? -[interviewer] Or Mark. [mask 2] What's wrong with "Mark"? Mark's easier. It's a four-letter word. [interviewer] I've started recording, just so you know... to have the masks on. [mask 3] Okay. How's this? What sparked this? 'Cause it's always kinda been there, but... why the sudden, you know, interest in focusing on Mark? I'm sure you've come back, you know, to Houston and... heard stuff here and there. You've seen the stuff on Facebook. Like, why now? [mask 2] He was a good guy. I mean, you'd never think... whatever happened to him or whatever he... did would be possible. [upbeat instrumental music playing] -[typing] -[Mark] A few months ago, I, along with several other people, -ran across the Turkish border. -[blasting] [Mark] I am now currently living in the Islamic State. I saw, like, Facebook posts that he was going... to join ISIS. And ever since then, I-- I just cut him off of Facebook as well. [mask 4] When I found out he was actually living there, the first stage of, you know, is just denial. Like, "No way. It can't be true. It can't be one of the people I grew up with." [mask 2] Uh, I think he just went full throttle with that. The other rumor is that he is an FBI informant. Because his conviction... was too strong. [mask 5] Especially in the Houston area, there were a few converts who were... FBI informants. Like, that has happened in the past. This is not just paranoia, right? This is, like, real. [mask 3] He was assigned a case, to work this area, his group of friends... -and, uh, he flunked-- -[mask 2] Yeah, it sounds-- it sounds more like that. Yeah, it sounds more like that, but at the same time, if that's true, then that sucks! 'Cause we were his friends. Like-- Maybe he never saw y'all as friends. Maybe, since day one, you know, y'all-- y'all were a target. Y'all were a target! [men speaking Urdu] -[mask 3] Moses. -[interviewer 1] Did you see the toys? [mask 2 clears throat] [interviewer 2] We'll just keep an eye on 'em from behind you. -[interviewer 3] What? -[mask 2] Keep moving back. [interviewer 2] Yeah. [mask 6] Even if he knew that this was about him, I don't think he'd watch it. I just feel like he wouldn't watch it, 'cause a lot of things don't phase him if it's against him. -[mask 1] It's not like-- -[mask 6] Wouldn't matter to him. [mask 1] It's not like we have to wear these masks because of something we did. We have to wear these -because of what he did. -[mask 3] Yeah. [mask 1] And that's important for him to know. [interviewer 2] Yeah, so if Mark saw this, he'd be like, "Look at these Muslims. They're covering their faces, and they've done nothing wrong." I mean, yeah. I mean, that's the state -of a Muslim in this country. -[mask 1] Yeah. [mask 3] It's to be scared. [mask 2] It's not all scared. Also because we're not-- We can't be selfish, right? -We have other people depending on us. -[mask 3] Yeah. [mask 2] And for us, being in this sensitive state, that's selfish, man. [stammers] That's very selfish, knowing that you could put your friends at risk, especially preaching this stuff. [mask 1] The things that he sends out and things he tries to get us to do are so over-the-top that it almost seems like he's purposely trying to bait us into something. And that's the only reason, I imagine, why people would think that he's a spy, because, uh, it just seems so... bad. Right? So cliché that... it's almost unbelievable. [instrumental music playing] [mask 1] He was my best friend. When I met him in middle school, I don't remember him having many friends, if any at all. Socially, in a-- in a group, I-- I saw that he was an outcast. He knew it, and I knew it, and everybody knew. I remember, one time we were playing volleyball, and somebody needed something, and he was like, "Here. I'm wearing an extra pair of jeans." He didn't have a belt to wear, so instead, he wore two pairs of jeans. It's just the weirdest thing in the world, but Mark did Mark. [mask 1] He kinda... He stood out, though. He was the only black guy in a... a group of brown people. When we turned 18, we decided to try the club scene. And that's always fun and interesting, uh... 'cause Mark doesn't drink or talk to girls. [chuckles] So I don't really know what he was doing in the clubs with me. But he basically went there to take care of me. I would find ways to sneak drinks, and he would watch my back while I did it. And then, uh... I would try to say, "Hey, let's-- let's go dance with some girls," and, uh... he would say, "You know, you go ahead and dance. I'll just-- I'll keep an eye on you from back here." He wasn't-- He wasn't a judgmental person. He said, you know, "You do you, and that's fine. You know, I-- I do me." And we-- we still got along. [upbeat instrumental music playing] [mask 4] Looking back, all of his troubles were with him trying to find somebody who he belongs with. And growing up in Sugar Land, Sugar Land was all about a melting pot. [mask 5] A lot of Desis moved here, a lot of East Asians. And it became incredibly diverse, but the African-American population always remained low. [mask 1] There weren't any black kids at school. Or really have any other, you know, black kids to relate to. [teens clamoring] -[typing] -[Mark] Today someone said, "You're the nicest black person I've met." Why can't I just be a nice person? [mask 1] He couldn't wear what was traditionally considered "black clothing," 'cause he, you know-- people would say he's not real black. Uh, he tried the goth, emo, punk, you know, stuff from Hot Topic. It didn't really work. Kinda just tried everything, you know, just throw a bunch against the wall, see what sticks type of thing, and nothing really stuck. Because he grew up around us, like, he liked our culture, too. [player clicks] [young men shouting in distance] -[car door shuts] -[young men chatting and laughing] [mask 2] Our friends and I were just debating with him, like, "You're already hanging out with us this much, you already believe the same things we believe. Why not just say a few words, accept the religion, and just pray with us so that you're 100% Muslim?" We were just hanging out in my car, and I told him what to say and what to repeat, and he did it. And I was like, "Did anything change? Do you feel any different?" And he was like, "No, I feel exactly the same." I'm like, "That's all it is. It's what's in your heart that counts." He converted at least three times. Went to the Shahada, which says you officially converted. And every time he converted, he got those big group of hugs he gets from uncles and people. [young men laughing in distance] [mask 1] We-- We tried our best to include him in everything. Mark still never really fit in, even when he became a Muslim. He was always that "black Muslim." [mask 7] We used to call him Beyoncé. [laughs] I remember we called him Beyoncé. [mask 1] The effortless joke. Uh, you know, something about... black people and fried chicken, or black people and watermelon. He would fire back with... you know, Pakistanis owning convenience stores and gas stations. [mask 2] He was still a black guy with a bunch of brown folk. We still had our language, we still spoke our language. We did our best to keep him involved. I don't think we ever did, uh-- made him feel isolated. [mask 3] A Muslim is the bottom of the barrel in this country. Like, period. Like, the blacks have it better than a Muslim. The whites have it better than a Muslim-- -[mask 6] Oh, no, no, no, no, no. -[mask 3] What you mean? [mask 6] He was the butt of the jokes, you know? He was the one that was getting picked on, and, like, he was going along with it at that time, but... over time, people start getting more sensitive to things, and you just don't know where, you know, things go wrong. [mask 4] After he accepted Islam, he only did more good things to, uh... to spend more time at the masjid. While the cultured, first-generation American-Muslims who were born and raised here all did the bad things that any other high schooler would do, Mark never did any of those things. [mask 1] He started asking questions about Islam, and, you know, we tried our best to answer 'em. A lot of times, we didn't have the answers and we told him to, you know-- We told him, "Look, um, we don't exactly know. You should probably seek out the answer." And, uh, I think that was where things started going weird. -[typing] -[Mark] Why is it that I see so many people born into Islam forming opinions and-- and patterns of behavior outside of Islam? Is it out of misinformation? Or do people simply not care about right between wrong? [solemn piano music playing] [mask 8] I think it was after college when we started seeing a change. He couldn't get a job because he did poli-science. And, uh, yeah, he couldn't do it. He-- He didn't, like-- He didn't have the opportunity of getting a-- a proper job. He finally got a job, and he left. He left for a good six months to a year. [mask 1] He did contract work as a truck driver for some oil place in some very, uh-- [sighs] Uh, white town. [mask 8] The individuals that he dealt with didn't like Muslims at all. I think that's when it started-- started changing a little bit. Like, he was almost solidified in his belief that, uh, the non-Muslims are the enemies of the Muslim, right? And then, uh, we have to establish a caliphate. [mask 9] He was passing out CDs of Anwar al-Aulaqi, calling for Jihad, I believe. And people were like, "Dude, you can't do this. Like, this is... a really, really bad situation. You're gonna call undue attention on these Muslims, and they don't want to get any attention from the feds in any way." So once that happened, I think he was kicked out. [mask 4] He hated everything that was happening to the Muslims all over the world. Um, and he blamed, I guess, the Muslims who were having fun more than they should. I remember walking into Kroger's in Sweetwater, and I saw him... stocking. And he had, like, a huge beard at that time. I was like, "What's up with the beard?" This, that, the other, and he's like, "You know... You guys don't know the religion right. You just... You-- You don't know anything. You just-- You're by birth." [mask 6] He goes on to say that, "You guys are coconut Muslims. You know, you justify your Western society, you know, to-- to-- to fit in with Islam. Right? But you're not gonna do the opposite. You're not gonna take your Islam and, you know, justify it into your own life." [typing] [Mark] It's a very sad moment when you go to the masjid for Friday prayers, and you see people selling beard trimmers outside. Why do Muslim men wear shorts? No one wants to see their private parts. American Muslims, you have done a great job at staying silent as your government killed and pillaged people in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. [mask 1] He's happy American soldiers are coming home in body bags. He would alhamdulillah, and, uh, hopefully-- And, uh, you know, "Let's keep praying for the destruction of anybody who stands in our path." He sees the brothers and sisters over here living nice and comfortably, not really being able to care for the people over there that are being hurt, that are being killed. [mask 2] When you tell me that he converts to Islam, "Bam, now I feel bad... [stammers] ...about people." Just to show people how-- how strong, how I believe. That-- That's not-- That seems more immature, and that seems even selfish. You are over here living comfortable, living cushy with, you know, your schools, and your, uh, degrees, and your jobs, and, you know, this whole, you know, life. [mask 2] You almost sound like him right now. You almost sound like-- like this is us versus them. You're doing what the-- what the Sith do, talking absolutes. He's putting himself in their shoes. That's why he's getting... angry and upset. So, in that sense, like, I do agree with him. You know, somebody needs to step up and do something. Because the world is just watching these people get basically pummeled into the ground. [soft piano music playing] I still felt like this guy is legit in what he's saying. He's just not articulating it properly, because the audience that he's catering to has just, you know, embraced Western culture. The suburban Desi, the Sugar Land Desi, he's tryin' to be as American as possible. [mask 1] With everything that was being said bad about... Muslims on the-- on the news and on the Internet, I guess everyone wanted to say, "Hey, look, I'm not like that type of Muslim. I'm not like Osama Bin Laden. You know, I'm... I'm born and raised here in America. I'm different." [mask 9] You know, I was told, "Don't go paintballing, at least until things cool down." Any other activity like that, that could be construed as a militant activity, we were told to stay away from, for your own good. You don't wanna get on the hook for that. [mask 5] Like, after 9/11, I remember... I had all these, like, T-shirts. Like, I had, like, a-- an MSA, Muslim Students Association, shirts. Uh, my mom was, like, not cool with that. One day, she threw them all away. [laughs] 'Cause she was like, "I don't want you wearing these, and I don't want people to, like, know... you're a part of this community," because she was afraid that I would be targeted. [fireworks crackling] -[excited chatter] -[fireworks whistling overhead] [Mark] American Muslims, -please wake up. -[whooshing] -[explosion blasts] -[Mark] If the kafir truly feared the Muslims... -[weapon fires] -...they would not be killing us globally. -[fireworks crackling overhead] -[Mark] The fact they don't fear us is why they keep shedding our blood. It is obligatory for Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan to engage in jihad. [mask 6] How the fuck is he getting away with this shit? He was on Facebook posting for how many months? [mask 3 stammers] That's why there's two sides to what I believe in. -[mask 1] Right. -[mask 6] And you can make really strong arguments for both sides. -[mask 3] For both sides. -[mask 6] Very strong. [mask 3] Mark got away with murder. If anybody said what-- the shit that Mark said-- [mask 6] If we said, yeah. Yeah. If any brown person with a Muslim name said the shit Mark said, we would be locked up doing life. Openly talked about jihad on, you know, online, on the Internet, on YouTube, on social media, right? In high school and during college, there was none of that. But then, all of a sudden, this huge change, post-graduation. [mask 5] It's not out of this world to believe that... that a convert, somebody who converted to Islam, was found out to be an FBI informant. [mask 9] A lot of people were just kind of shocked at the fact that, you know... um... FBI agents had been embedded so firmly in the Houston Muslim community. An FBI car would be parked outside of my house because my brother was at madrassa. And we'd know that we were getting, you know, tracked. Always happens. Mom and Dad is ex-military. Right? None of this is going on before graduation. Post-graduation, Mom and Dad is like, "You know what? Our baby needs a job." Get him up there to DC, do some training for six, seven months, send him back down here as a mole, and, uh... uh, get to work. [mask 6] Mark, on his Facebook, checks into Turkey. And that's when I'm like... -"Fuck." I was like... -[mask 3] "What?" [mask 6] I went around telling everybody, 'cause Turkey, at that time, was known as, like, this portal into ISIS, right? So, a couple weeks passed by, and bam, there it is. I wake up this one morning, and there's a fucking big ass message. And I get this huge hard-on -'cause I'm about to read it. -[laughs] [typing] [Mark] I am now currently living in the Islamic State. I'm sure some people want to know what life is like here, so I'll tell you honestly. So, he was open about himself being in Syria. He gave, like, a full-on, thorough, Yelp-type review about ISIS. [Mark] Food. You won't find Chinese takeaway, Mexican, or sushi. Cell phones. Cell phones are available here. However, all service has been banned due to American drones. Slavery. Slaves do exist here. I personally haven't seen any. Television. The Islamic State allows television. [mask 6] Two out of ten for this shit. -Four out of five for this bullshit. -[mask 3 laughs] [mask 6] You know, Internet, fuckin' zero out of ten. So it was very like Mark complaints. But it-- it-- it's just, you know... It's sad, sad to see where he is. Sad to see what's happened to him, if it's true. If he's an FBI informant, then at least he got a job. [chuckles] [mask 5] I go back and forth. I-- I think a part of me thinks he did. Uh, now. Like, at this point-- if you ask me tomorrow, I'll probably be like, "Nah, he's an FBI informant." [mask 1] I would 100% rather have him be an agent than to be radicalized. Because it is-- it is more heartbreaking for me... to believe... to know that he, uh... that he really believes the things that he says. That, to me, is more heartbreaking than for him to be an agent tryin' to, you know... Or being an informant, tryin' to save his own ass. That, to me, is not as heartbreaking as it is to know that he actually believes the bullshit that he preaches. [slow instrumental music playing] [mask 1] You know, I-- I feel like... like I let him down. That I'm somewhat responsible. Because, like I was saying earlier, it's that... you know, he asked us these questions about Islam. And if I could have just answered those questions for him, even if I didn't have the answers, if I could have guided him to the right sources... he wouldn't be this way. He would say, "Hey, why is-- Why does the Koran say this?" Or, "Why does the Koran say that?" And we'd say, "I don't fucking know, you know? Go look it up." And I feel like that's-- that's where everything went wrong. That if I could have just either answered those questions for him, or if I didn't have the answers, taken him to somebody who did have the answers, maybe he'd still be with us... one of us, today. Has anyone here prepared for the possibility that he may not even be alive at this point? That's what-- More and more, that-- that question plagues me more than, "Oh, was he a spy? Or was he... was he really radicalized? Did he do this on purpose, or is it just what happened? Is it a mental thing?" That, I think about that far less than I actually think about the-- the idea that, "Is this guy--" [stammers] -"Has he passed? Is he dead?" -[mask 2] Well-- [mask 2] I'm pretty sure-- I'm assuming-- [mask 1] That's something I struggle with more than anything else. [soft instrumental music playing]
