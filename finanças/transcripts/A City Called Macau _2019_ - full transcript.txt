(On 20th of Dec. 1999, Macau is officially handover to PR China.) Lower the flags of the Republic of Portugal and Macau. Raise the flags of the People's Republic of China and Macau SAR. Lower the flags of the Republic of Portugal and Macau. Raise the flags of the People's Republic of China and Macau SAR. (October 2002.) That day, I shivered in the sunlight. The eye of the typhoon was about to pass. His flight was 5 hours late. Lucky it landed before the eye passed, or I would have had an even longer wait. Be sure to call him Kevin. Mr. Duan likes the ladies to call him Kevin. He's a wealthy real-estate developer with one project in downtown Beijing, and a new one in the suburbs. Here he comes. I realized I'd met this "Kevin Duan" before. This wasn't our first encounter. I think of everyone I meet as "clients." I make a point of ignoring their names, so that I won't get emotionally involved. There's no room for emotion in my line of work. Not that I dare think much about what I really do. Zero. Odds are it won't land on zero again. What exactly are the odds? Depends on your luck. Don't bet on zero again, Mr. Duan. Macau hasn't had a war in 400 years. Nor famine or plagues. It's blessed with luck. Zero! Nice one, Mr. Duan! Amazing. You're on a roll, Mr. Duan! Share it with the others. Thanks, Mr. Duan! You brought me luck. Buy yourself something nice. - Let's go. - Yes, sir. - Liu. - Mr. Duan. This is Kevin. Hello, Mr. Duan. - This is Ms. Mei. - Hello, Ms. Mei. Here in Macau, "Mei" also means bad luck. Best call her Xiao-Ou. Sorry to keep you waiting, Ms. Ou. After that stiff introduction, the ice between us melted. I wasn't sure if the change came from him, or from me. And I wasn't sure if he didn't recognize me, or simply didn't want to. He wasn't at all like Liu described, but he was still the same man I'd once struck up a conversation with. I didn't mind. Ms. Ou... that's a nice-sounding name. Thank you, Mr. Duan. You're from Beijing, Ms. Ou? Yes, but I've lived down south for years. Have I picked up the accent? Or not? Mr. Duan. Mr. Liu. This way, please. Don't go too far. I won't be long. Would you like a drink? Gambling and drinking don't mix. One vice per night is enough. That night, I found myself alone with Kevin Duan. I felt uncomfortable after Liu left us, like we'd suddenly lost our chaperone. Turns out Kevin Duan had better luck than I'd expected. Can we switch dealers? Yes. Good luck, sir. Your cards, sir. Show them. Player wins. Your winnings, sir. What's that about? Just exchanging chips. Place your bets. Player wins. Cheers, Mr. Duan! What does that mean? It means that you should tip Zhuan. This is fun. Who came up with this? If there were a Nobel Prize for math, he'd win it. Excuse me, I have to make a call. Zhuan will look after you. Don't go. You're my good luck charm. That's baccarat. He's about to win three in a row. He's hardcore. That's how to play. Player wins. If you want to play, just drop my name to get chips. Thanks, Uncle Hua. Don't mention it. Good afternoon, Mr. Duan. We'll arrange a private car for you next time. That's excellent service. You played so well, you earned it. Kevin Duan never talked about himself. Each visit, before he left, we'd stroll by the beach, enjoying the pristine beauty of a place that didn't belong to us. But I was labouring under a delusion. Macau was just the stage on which we acted out an impossible ideal of platonic male-female friendship. an impossible ideal of platonic male-female friendship. Not long after that, I went to Beijing to collect Liu's debt. Not long after that, I went to Beijing to collect Liu's debt. While there, I made some enquiries about Duan. Seems he'd used a recent windfall to buy a tract of land. He was rumored to be well-connected. I didn't give it much thought. When I cornered Liu at an art exhibition, I met another person who would shape my life: Shi Qilan. Mr. Liu. How'd you find me here? It wasn't easy. About your debt, we've... Listen, Xiao-Ou... Now's not the time. Don't embarrass me. I already gave you three month's grace. We settle this today, or I post your name to our debtor website. Don't do that... Liu? Let's talk another day. Wait! Actually, this is the friend I'm buying your artworks for. Wait! Actually, this is the friend I'm buying your artworks for. Wait! Actually, this is the friend I'm buying your artworks for. Let me introduce you two. His works are very valuable. And they'll appreciate. Take a few as collateral. Allow me to introduce Ms. Ou from Macau. What's so good about these? They're not as good as the ones over there. Why's that? What do you mean? Those are my early works. I want to know why you like them. I don't know. It's just a feeling. Ms. Ou has quite an eye for art. Say, why don't you invite her to your studio? Say, why don't you invite her to your studio? Walking into his studio, I felt like I understood him. He was unlike anyone I'd met. He was unlike anyone I'd met. He was unlike anyone I'd met. There was a mingled scent of plaster and metal, wood and plants. He seemed more artisan than artist, a master craftsman. I couldn't guess his age, or that he was married, with a baby on the way... We have a guest? Hi. I'm Mei Xiao-Ou. I'm Xiao-Xiao. You're pregnant. That's right. When's the due date? June 17th. You two talk. I'll make some tea. What are you doing? Sculpting you. Do you mind? What's interesting about me? My husband's like a madman when inspiration strikes. Don't mind him, Ms. Mei. Call me Xiao-Ou. My surname isn't very lucky. You haven't told me what a casino broker does. Does that have something to do with the sculpture? Sure it does. Sculpting someone is a process of getting to know them. Knowing about your profession, life and personality helps me bring it to life. Well, basically... I work in customer service. What kind of service? Depends what the client wants. If a client wants chips, he can buy them in cash from the casino, or get a line of credit with us, then pay back the credit line with cash. I'm like a middleman. Or a walking credit card. You could say that. Isn't it more convenient to buy chips with cash? We provide anonymity. That's great if your clients win, but what if they lose? We make them pay back the debt. Sounds risky. If a few clients renege, you could go bankrupt. That rarely happens. Look me up if you come to Macau. I'll show you around. Great. Let's go after the baby's born. You can show us around then. Sure thing. Have some tea. Liu paid his debt in full. Ms. Fay is really happy with you. She upped your quota, and she's letting me work with you in the VIP room. I didn't realise Liu was so easily spooked. Ms. Fay's been talking you up to everyone, saying what a great job you did. Not long after that, Shi Qilan really did visit Macau. He said that to sculpt me, he needed to understand me, to understand my work and my environment. I wasn't keen on it, but I agreed to satisfy his curiosity. Can you take me to the casino? Fine. I suppose gambling's inevitable, here. I'll give you a tour, but don't miss your flight. You have three hours. I'll get you some chips. Okay. Let's go. We win! Okay, let's cash out. I get it now. Give me the chips. Place your bets. All bets are in. Your cards, sir. What did you get? Banker has 5. Did I win? Yes, you have 9. Your winnings, sir. This is fun. Really fun. See? If I hadn't become your client, how could I understand you? Right away, my suspicions were confirmed. Right away, my suspicions were confirmed. He took to it too quickly, too enthusiastically. He couldn't possibly be new at this. I had a bad feeling about him. Hello? I have to take care of something. Go ahead. Don't miss your flight. Your cards, sir. Hey, you're on a roll. Player wins. Your winnings, sir. Your winnings, sir. How about a side bet? How about a side bet? Under the table, triple your fun. If you win, I'll pay you triple your table winnings. How does that sound? How does that sound? The phone number you're trying to reach is unavailable. (April, 2003.) At the height of the SARS outbreak, airports and ports closed. Business deals fell through. Many of my clients fled to Macau. They spent a month in the casino, waiting for the outbreak to end. As of today, April 27th, 2003, the nationwide death toll from SARS stands at 18. One death was reported in Beijing. All train stations and airports will begin scanning travelers' temperature... Nine! Wow! That's amazing! Player wins. That's amazing! Mr. Shi! When did you arrive? I never left. There's a SARS outbreak in Beijing. Why didn't you call me? I figure I can buy my own chips. Why don't we talk later? Your cards, sir. I start losing when you're watching over my shoulder. When did Shi Qilan show up? Are you hiding something from me? Hey, Cat. I got a package here that I can't handle on my own. This way, Cat. Hua. Is the package still winning? Come here. I'll cover the losses from before. But our new contract means a three-way split. Sound fair? Player wins. I've won enough. Let's call it a day. Get your boss to cash me out. Good job, Mr. Shi! You're on a roll. It'd be a shame to stop now. Make Mr. Shi some of my special tea. Is this one of Hua's scams? How could you get mixed up in this? Stay away from Shi Qilan. He'll never be a client of mine. In October 2003, Beijing lifted the SARS travel ban. Right after that, I got a call from Xiao-Xiao saying Shi Qilan had gone missing. (2004) By 2004, Duan's business had expanded and he was bringing us more clients. We became business partners. Hello, Mr. Duan. Welcome. Hello, there. My friends and I were in France inspecting vineyards. Thought we'd stop by. These are my friends, Xiao-Ou and Cat. These are my friends, Xiao-Ou and Cat. Welcome. The car's waiting. Welcome. The car's waiting. - Let's go. - This way, please. Xiao-Ou! Liu. What brings you here? I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel, hoping the high-rollers drop some crumbs for me. Things can't be that bad. Listen, Duan's buddies are rich, powerful guys. They want to up the ante with a five-fold side bet. I won't do anything illegal. Besides, people who bet like that end up losing everything and are never heard from again. I understand... Mr. Duan. Mr. Duan. Show my friends a good time. But don't go overboard. No worries. I can tell that you don't want me making side bets. Of course not. Why not? Will we still be friends tomorrow, whether you win or lose tonight? I don't see why not. You can gamble against a casino, but not against a friend. What did Cat want with you? Zhuan will fund your play at the amount we agreed on. I'll be back soon. This way. He's upstairs. Mr. Shi! How's the food here? Tell Ms. Ou what you told me. You're just going to sulk? Xiao-Ou... I know I should have gone to you first. You're a grown man. At least call your wife. The loan sharks have moved into your house! Waiter! Couldn't you have picked a better place to hide? It's called hiding in plain sight. Right, Cat? I'm safer in Macau. One of these days, you'll lose your wife, too. I can stand to lose everything, except her. How the fuck can you say that? Go to hell! I brought some expensive rosewood. I'll give you the sculptures as collateral, to finance my comeback. I'm still your client, after all. You've never been my client. Looks like you're done. Time to go. Looks like you're done. Time to go. I can leave on my own. Xiao-Ou, find me a place to stay. Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Duan. You were gone for a while. Don't play if luck isn't on your side today. Have a sauna and get a good night's sleep. We'll meet again tomorrow. Sure. It must've been a serious problem. Do you have to get back to it after this? Do you have to get back to it after this? It's all settled. I've settled things, too. I've wired you what I owe. Thanks, Mr. Duan. Take your time. Time is important in your line of work. When did you get divorced? When my son was two. Lu Jin-Tong is my son's father. I loved him deeply once. A child is a woman's ultimate trump card. I've been playing that card since before my son was even born. I've been playing that card since before my son was even born. Jin-Tong, if you don't stop gambling, I'll get rid of the kid. Don't make a scene. I'm winning here. I'm not messing around. Quit while you're ahead. Don't you want a house? This will pay for a house, a garden and our kid's tuition! You're still betting? Did you not hear a word I said? I'm going to start jumping. You hear me now? I'm going to start jumping. You hear me now? Stop that! What if the kid falls out? Exactly! I'll keep jumping until you quit gambling. You hear me? Let's go, now! Just one peek. Stop it! Let's go! Blackjack. Dealer wins. Come on, let's go! What the hell? I was doing just fine until you showed up! I was doing just fine until you showed up! You know how much I had riding on that? You screwed my winning streak! After that beating, I knew I needed a place to hide. Jin-Tong's friend Shang had gotten him hooked on gambling. When Shang heard I'd left Jin-Tong, he tracked me down. Shang told me he loved me. And I needed a place to stay. When Shang got me a job in the casino, I found I had a talent for identifying lucrative clients. I found I had a talent for identifying lucrative clients. Xiao-Ou. I'm leaving Macau tomorrow. Will you come with me? I've already cleared my debt to you. You can have the house. Take care of yourself. I may not come back from Europe this time. Xiao-Ou, it's Hua. You stalking me? I spotted Shang leaving. I thought he was taking care of you. Listen, men like him only care about themselves. Listen, men like him only care about themselves. They run at the first sign of trouble. Go away. What the hell? Did you forget that you're Chinese? The handover's coming up. Soon, this'll be our turf. Hua was the first man I met in Macau. He was Shang's man then, but he always had his eye on me. You need someone like Hua or Cat to survive in Macau. Shi Qilan gave us the slip, and he's back at the tables. Shi Qilan gave us the slip, and he's back at the tables. He even pawned his watch. Come on. Come on, nine! Yes! A winner! Ms. Ou. Cat. How long's he been here? Since dawn. He started with nothing. At first, he just wandered around... Then he found himself a lucky table. Place your bets. Trust me, bet on the player. Who pays if I lose? I do. Just tip me if you win. We'll split it 50-50. Deal. Your cards, ma'am. Nine! Nine! Yes, we won! Thank you. Same bet. She left, but he kept playing. She left, but he kept playing. I'll go call him off. He'll go bust soon enough. I knew I should've taken him on. I told you, we don't want him as a client. Did you lose it all? I was up 980 grand at one point. I should've cashed out then. But the banker was on a streak, and I didn't want to miss out. One hand was all it took to lose everything. The banker had won 15 hands straight, but I should've bet on the player. Even the smartest player gets it wrong sometimes. Let's go eat. A receipt? (I here by confirm that I have received several rosewood artworks from Qilan.) (Mei Xiao-Ou. 18th of Oct., 2004) There's no rosewood in that suitcase. What? I don't have any rosewood. What's in the suitcase, then? A bag of rice and two bags of noodles. Shall we go? You bastard! You spent thousands lugging around rice and noodles, you piece of shit? You spent thousands lugging around rice and noodles, you piece of shit? How could you screw me over, of all people? Calm down and let me explain. Explain what, you asshole? Explain what, you asshole? There's not an ounce of truth in you! I did have it. You weren't sleeping yesterday, were you? You went out, sold the wood cheap and gambled the money away! You didn't see how well I was doing. Of course I didn't! Ms. Ou, Cat. Ms. Ou, Cat. What are you doing, Qilan? Meditating? Have you had a chance to think, these last few days? It's time to go back to your wife and get on with your life. She's already on her way. You might want to shower so you look decent when she arrives. He was a decent person at heart. I knew he was just doing this to get back at me. I'd caged him like an animal, so now he was acting like one. It was a way of marking his territory, a form of possession. It was a way of marking his territory, a form of possession. - What are you doing? - Let me go! What are you doing? Xiao-Xiao's almost here! Get down! Let me die! Let me die! Let go of me! Xiao-Xiao took Qilan away, and I became her scapegoat. My pity for him had turned into a weapon that could be turned on me. Stop that! Women so often treat pity as their own worst enemy. Get away! Stop it! Why did you force him into that apartment? Why did you force him into that apartment? Why did you hide him away from his family, friends and me? You did this! Let me go! Mr. Shang, why are you here? Where's Yang's father? I'm his father. I'm here to settle his debt. Please take a seat, sir. He's my mistress' kid. He has her last name. But I'm his father, so I'll pay his debt. How much does he owe you? Everyone knows you're a man of his word. I'm a decent man, too. Let's forget the interest. But he still owes 160 million. That's the lowest I can go. I was in this business, too. I won't renege. Sit down right here. You, too, Hua. Dad. Punch him. He owes you money. This way, he'll know he has to pay. Hua will scam anyone. He's done it to me, too. This is my last time in Macau. I left everything to the boy and his mother. The kid's had it tough. His mother ran off with some guy. So I left him my money. I didn't think it'd be his downfall. I think now you know that I have nothing left. There's still the place you left me. You can live there. Xiao-Ou, you know why I wanted to be with you? Because I knew right away that Lu wasn't good enough for you. That's in the past. I don't want to hear his name again. I'm taking my son to Europe tomorrow. Be careful of Hua. (October, 2008.) Ten years after the handover, Macau was more popular than ever. Every day was like Golden Week holiday. The Macau border crossing was packed with tourists day and night. I'd almost forgotten that I hadn't seen Kevin Duan that year. But this day would change everything I knew about him. Ready for some fun in Macau? Yes! There's gambling and entertainment in the main hall, There's gambling and entertainment in the main hall, and a shopping center on the third floor. Feel free to roam around tomorrow. That's what makes this place unique. Have fun, everyone. I'll take 3000 in chips. (You look well.) (Look ahead of you.) What's a big shot like you doing in the main hall? It's more fun here during the holidays. Sit. I haven't seen you for six months. Why are you spending Golden Week here? The city's empty. All the businessmen are down here, so I came along, too. Let me take you to the VIP room. To make up for last time. No credit limit. No rush. Hello. Ms. Fay, Mr. Duan is asking for more than my limit. Can I apply for more? Can you vouch for him? Yes. Besides, I have the house. Yes. Besides, I have the house. Your house wouldn't begin to cover his debt. Watch your back, then. Cheers, Mr. Duan. Thanks. Your three pots of tea, sir. Enjoy. Can I switch dealers? Good luck, sir. Pass. Place your bets. Player, banker, player, banker. Player has zero. Banker has seven. Player gets an extra card. Pass. Player, banker, player, banker... It's a pity not biding on this. Hey, you're thinner. It's been two months. This reminds me of that hand at the Grand Emperor that night... I'm about to go to work on this. Sure. I won't bother you, then. Pass. Pass. (Quietly ask Liu ) (if Duan came to Macau in July.) Pass. (He didn't.) (What about mid-August?) (No.) (Forget Liu. I doubt he knows anything.) That's enough. Cat, check if Kevin Duan has played in other casinos the last two months. No need. I'm sure he's made side bets in other casinos. He lost big time and decided to come back to you. He wouldn't do that. Oh, no? Want to bet? Listen, I grew up here. And there's a saying for people who play like him: He's either flush as hell, or broke as hell. Your Mr. Duan isn't doing so hot today. He's not betting normally. He must've lost a ton out there. If he wins today, then we've helped him cover his losses. If he loses, then he's dug another hole on our turf. Pull him out before he loses, and you might survive this. You're back. Look at how much I've made. I told you this place brings me luck! I told you this place brings me luck! Let's call it a day, then. No way. Let's get something to eat and go shopping. There's a watch I want to buy. What watch? I'll buy it for you. I'll set these winnings aside, and buy your watch with this. You'll have one too, Zhuan! Cheers, Mr. Duan! Good luck! Player has nine, dealer has three. Player wins. Player has nine, dealer has three. Player wins. Let me get you some hot water, sir. Don't move that! What are you doing? Sorry, sir. Don't like to see me win? Sorry, sir. I'll get you another round. Forget it. He didn't mean it. You've already won so much. Let's call it a day. I'm fine. Here you go, sir. I'm fine. Let's go. No more bets. Player has seven. Banker has six. Player wins. Go. I've got you now. As I sat there watching him lose, I could feel my house being dismantled piece by piece, my garden shrinking with each losing hand. My future, like an ocean being reclaimed, filled with dirt and rubble and stones... That azure bay was disappearing fast, along with the sunlight and the seagulls... It's too late. He's on a downward slide. He was on a streak. How'd he start losing? It's my fault. I tried to get him out by saying I wanted a watch. Now you've lost the watch, and you're saddled with his debt. I told you I'd pay. How? Even two houses wouldn't be enough! How? Even two houses wouldn't be enough! Ms. Fay. Xiao-Ou. I've looked into it. Duan started accounts at two other casinos a few months ago, and lost big. You let your emotions get in the way, Xiao-Ou. You let your emotions get in the way, Xiao-Ou. I never thought Duan would screw me over like this. The holidays are coming. Buy something nice for your family. That's a bit much... Is Mr. Duan having money troubles? Are you worried about him? Of course I am. Don't worry. He's got plenty of money. Did he get it from other casinos? I don't know. He's your client. Ask him. I don't know. He's your client. Ask him. What are you implying? That I helped him make side bets? What are you implying? That I helped him make side bets? Did I mention side bets? You know how I am, Liu. I can personally vouch for him. He'll pay up. And what's your character reference worth? Do you know how much money he cost us? He set me up! There was this one time... he went to the airport and came straight back. That's how it started... He's got such a huge business, but maybe he was short of cash? Needed it for something he was bidding on, or the project would go to someone else. So who set the bets up? Hua? I think so. Did you introduce him? It wasn't me. I swear. I suspect Hua had him in his sights already. I blame Duan hitting his stride too early. Too much luck, too soon, made him cocky. Rich guys like him all have the same problem: they don't know when to give up. Too much pride. (wire 300 grand to each of my HK account.) Seems like pride brought him low this time. Duan may have his pride now, but he came from nothing. In his fourth year of college, his parents gave him a sack of fried pancakes to last the semester. When they started to get moldy, he hung them out in the quad to dry in the sun. He hung his poverty out for all to see! He's made of different stuff. You keep bragging on him, then. Xiao-Ou, I like to keep track of my accounts. Despite his 100 million in debt, Duan managed to get ten hours of sleep before inviting me out to dinner. He'd even tidied himself up. The only tell was a tiny nick on the right side of his neck, like he started every day at knifepoint. This is what my friends owe you. I'll cover that. This is what I owe you. I'm good for it. How many days do you need, Mr. Duan? Don't I have ten days to pay? This debt is enough to destroy me, Mr. Duan. We've known each other for so long, Xiao-Ou. Have I ever made trouble for you? Then ten days it is. Okay. Eat up. Happy birthday, Ms. Fay. Thank you. Birthdays come once a year, but not all of them are happy. Is something wrong? Xiao-Ou, as of today, this casino isn't mine anymore. Then... whose is it? Hua's taken it over. Hua? How'd he become so powerful? You know what he's like. He got Shang's son into debt, and Shang had to pay up. Shang gave his company to Hua to cover the 200 million debt, and Hua came out 500 million ahead. Ms. Fay! Hello, Hua. I came to toast you on your birthday. Of course. Happy birthday. Join us, Ms. Ou. Thanks. I won't intrude. I have business to attend to. Sure. Enjoy yourselves. Come back later. Sure. Kevin Duan's debt to Hua is several times bigger than his debt to us. Hua offered me 300 million for the casino. How could I refuse? Now he's Duan's biggest creditor. And you're Duan's guarantor. If he misses the deadline, Hua will turn against you. Best set some new rules with Hua. Otherwise, you're vulnerable. Today's the sixth day, Mr. Duan. You have four days left. Just a reminder. Ms. Ou! Today's the 7th day. Any news from Duan? I've been calling him every day. It was me. I set up his side bets. He wanted to bet five-fold. I only gave him three. Otherwise, he would've lost even more. I don't care about your rules with Ms Fay. Now that I'm the boss, I call the shots. You'll collect your debts, one way or another. You'll collect your debts, one way or another. Le-Le. Where are we going, mama? We're moving back to our old place. Why? It's closer to where I work. Can I help you? I have an appointment with Mr. Duan. Just tell him it's his friend from Macau. He invited me. Just a moment while I call to confirm. There's a lady here for Mr. Duan... Miss, you can't go up there! Miss... There's construction going on! It's dangerous! Besides, Mr. Duan isn't here. I just confirmed it. Miss, please... why don't you come back another day? Leave your name at the front desk, and we'll make an appointment. This way, please. Miss, you really can't go up there! Please, miss, don't make this difficult. Spectacular. Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I'll wire this much to you tomorrow. The rest will come over the next few days. If you pay up, I'll pay for the chandelier. One debt for another. No need. Consider the chandelier a reminder. And what a reminder it was! Thanks. I've been overseeing my projects in Qinghai and Xinjiang. I just came back yesterday. That's why I couldn't wire you the money in time. Sorry I made you come all this way. Don't worry. Did the loan come through? You're doing okay now? You needn't worry. Leave it to me. It's all taken care of. Is that so? Usually the hole only gets deeper. What you have now is worth a hundred times more than those pancakes. Isn't it enough? You're like a dumb kid playing with blocks, building higher, wanting more. If you have a hundred, you want two hundred. If it falls to 99, you start to worry, and don't eat or sleep for days. you start to worry, and don't eat or sleep for days. You must have a number in mind, right? How much is enough? Think you'll ever get there? Do you realize that when you reach a certain point, it'll come crumbling down... Xiao-Ou, I'm trying to make enough to pay you back. Xiao-Ou, I'm trying to make enough to pay you back. I know that you're bearing all my debts. You had to put your house up to pay the casino. I feel like you're not the same person I knew in Macau. Of course, things are different in Beijing. You're a boss. You're a husband. Perhaps a lover to another woman. I don't know... Even after losing so much money, you're still not sincere. (One message. From Cat.) You know, I've never felt that mine is a lowly profession, but your attitude makes me feel that way. I haven't had a word of apology from you. Is there any truth in what you say? No matter. You want to be high and mighty. I'm just a peon. Despite our long friendship, I'm not worthy of your sincerity. The moment you started betting behind my back, you stopped being that cool and debonair Mr. Duan. You've got a lot of creditors waiting for you back in Macau. All it takes is a loose pillar or two to bring the whole building down. All it takes is a loose pillar or two to bring the whole building down. And still you act so smug... (Two new messages. From Cat.) Is something wrong? Are you going to tell me about all your big projects? That you've bought land all over the country? That they all have great feng shui, they'll all make tons of money. You can't pay me back in cash, but you can pay me back in land, right? The world is changing every day. Beijing's changed a lot, too. Yet I'm still the same old idiot... believing other people's lies. (Five new messages.) Hello, Xiao-Ou... talk to her yourself, Mr. Shi. Xiao-Ou, I've got a show in Hong Kong. Thought I'd stop by to see you... Hello? Hello? Xiao-Ou, can you hear me? You promised your wife and me that you'd stay away from casinos. I know. I'm not gambling. Shi Qilan, if you stay away from gambling, I'll forgive your debt. Are you trying to buy my love for 30 million? Are you worth that much? I just feel sorry for your wife and child. You were drinking too fast. Have some soup. Having problems with a client? Tell me. He's my problem, but he's not my client. And you don't want him to be. You seem worried about him. Are you in love with him? I brought him into the casino. He's my responsibility. Let me tell you about my friend's strange theory. He thinks you brokers have made enough money off him. Every penny you make comes from him. Win or lose, you take one percent of what he spends on chips. Win or lose, you take one percent of what he spends on chips. A hundred grand might pass between a gambler and a casino in one night, A hundred grand might pass between a gambler and a casino in one night, But during those eight or nine hours, brokers are typically moving millions back and forth, exchanging chips. brokers are typically moving millions back and forth, exchanging chips. Let the little fish fight it out. The fisherman always wins in the end. So my friend thinks the best solution is to not repay the debt. Those casino brokers make a fortune off him. Why should he pay them? Let the broker pay the casino. So you think I'm a fisherwoman, Mr. Duan? Kevin Duan used his fish and fisherman allegory to justify skipping out on his debt. I had my doubts, but they're gone now. Right from the start, he never intended to pay. The key to my house. Take it. That should clear Duan's debt to the casino, right? Don't resent me. I'm just going by the book. He still owes me for the side bets. How will you get that back? I want to give him another chance. That's what I like about you. We haven't had a proper chat in years. What's there to chat about? Drink with me, Mr. Wu. Xiao-Ou, we all know that as long as a broker doesn't gamble, he'll end up rich. If he gambles, he'll end up a broker again. But you don't gamble. So why aren't you rich? Because you gamble with your feelings. I want to help you, Xiao-Ou. Work the side bets with me. I'll cover the debt. Just give me more time. No, no, no. Remember: you're not paying me, you're paying off those side bets. Out of respect for Shang, I'll give you six months. Shang is a stand-up guy. He covered his son's debt, and asked me to look after you. Very generous. I'll give each of you a card (2010) that allows you to gamble anywhere in the main hall. Just swipe the card, and return it to me when you're done. I'll go get some chips for you, okay? You doing okay? What else can I do? The VIP rooms won't spare me any credit. Because of Hua? No problem. I'm making money now. I won't let you eat scraps. Shi's in the main hall. I don't know where he got the cash, but he's up 100 grand. What's this? Stop or I'll scream. There are cameras everywhere. I went through this once with Lu Jin-Tong. If I go down this road again, I'm terrified where I might end up. What are you doing here in Macau? I came to see you. You've got some nerve. I also wanted to work out a repayment plan with you. I've got a great plan. You could say it's a scheme. What plan could you possibly have? I really do have a plan, but since you wouldn't see me, I thought I'd play a few hands. You wouldn't have shown up otherwise, right? But fortune strikes when you least expect it. I'm up almost 200 grand. And for this plan, you had to come to Macau? I couldn't talk about it on the phone. Where are you going? A once-noble bird has found its way into a humble home. What does that mean? You've been playing all day. Time for bed. This casino owner bought some of my sculptures, and he thinks I'm big shot. He wants me to lure rich mainlanders to his casino down south. I have some relatives in business. They're loaded. If I can get even one of them down south, I can pay you back. How do you plan to do that? By taking a cue from you. I'll be a casino broker. The boss will lend me the money. I have three options: One, I take a commission. Two, I get a cut of the winnings. Three, the best option, the player loses everything, I collect the debt and pay you. How's that sound? Won't that screw the casino boss over? I didn't say I won't pay him. He'll have to wait his turn. I'll repay him with interest. Just don't ask me when. I want no part of this. You don't have to do a thing. You can't afford to pay him back. Of course I can. Since you're so confident, I'll be waiting. You've got this big plan, running all the way down here to cheat some casino out of its money. I didn't want to keep you waiting. I want to pay you back first. I said there's no hurry! Why not, mama? It's our money. Why are you still up? This is grown-up talk. When I lent five dollars to my classmate, you said to get it back. It's not the same thing, okay? How is it not? Your mother works hard to support you. It's not easy. You shouldn't throw money around. Have you showered yet? Go on. Does your wife know? Wouldn't that make her hate you even more? If you tell her I've forgiven your debt, would she still hate me? I didn't tell her. First, I want to pay you back. Second, my wife hates you already. You're a double victim. I lost tens of millions, and took a slap from her. Now she hates me. Why is it so hard to be a decent person? When I returned to Beijing, she kept saying that she could tell. You did everything you could for me and didn't even slap her back. She's sure there's something between us. If you cancel my debt, wouldn't that just make her more suspicious? Not even my parents have done this much for me. I feel guilty about what I've done to you and Xiao-Xiao. Stop mentioning me and your wife in the same sentence. I don't owe anything to anyone, except to you and Xiao-Xiao. Qilan, all you have left are your hands. The 2008 U.S. mortgage crisis set off a financial tsunami in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng crashed, sending ripples through mainland Chinese markets. The real estate market took the worst hit. Not surprisingly, Kevin Duan vanished again. Then I heard that he and his family were spending Chinese New Year holiday in Sanya. Then I heard that he and his family were spending Chinese New Year holiday in Sanya. Hello, you must be Mr. Duan's wife, Ms. Yu. That's right. Are you looking for him? Yes. He's not here. Why don't you take a seat? Thanks. Tea, please. I'm a television journalist. My name is Mo. I'm doing a show about the families of successful people. I heard that you and Mr. Duan were staying here. Sorry to show up uninvited. I was hoping for an interview. But he isn't in town. My daddy bought some land in Haikou. He had to go deal with it. Maybe I can talk to you, then. Xiao-Ou, I've brought my cousin down south. I'll be able to pay you back soon. Don't get into trouble again. Remember you're borrowing real money, not just plastic chips. Understood. Gotta go. I've got a family to feed! Chinese New Year is coming, and I can't even afford rice... You don't need to yell... The contract says that we're paid monthly, but the workers haven't been paid for months... Why are you here? You naughty girl... I've got a guest. Why don't we talk later? I'm here to solve your problems. Okay? Tell everyone out there. I'm in Hainan dealing with this property so that I can pay you back. I hate to part with it. Land values are skyrocketing. You know the casino rules, right? Of course I do. You need to pay interest if you're late. Let me calculate the interest... It's too high. When you borrowed from us, you agreed to the terms. But looking at it now, the interest rate really is too high. It's usury. I don't make the rules. Rules? More like extortion! You didn't mind when you needed money in the casino! Didn't I beg you stay away from side bets? Did Hua send you? Don't mention him. This is between you and me. Tell me the truth: how much did you pocket from side bets? Have you no gratitude? What do you take me for? I've begged, borrowed, even sold my house for you! I've begged, borrowed, even sold my house for you! I gave you an extension because I know you're in trouble. Because we've been friends for over a decade. Because I want to help you get through hard times. Get it? No! I see you as an older brother, a friend. That's the truth, believe it or not. You keep saying you'll wire the money. Do you even have it? Aren't you ashamed of doing this to a single mother? You said this is between us. Don't bring your kid into it. I have to answer this. Hi, Wen-Wen. I'll be back tomorrow. What interview? Hey, my cousin's winning. He's won a lot! I'll get a piece of it. Go screw yourself, Qilan! What the hell did you do? How dare you! What did you tell my wife? You know what I said. I'm warning you. Stay away from my family! Don't worry about me. Worry about how you'll pay me. You know, Bank of China is open during Chinese New Year. I'll give you my account number. Are you blackmailing me now? It's just a friendly reminder. Xiao-Ou, it's true I've been having money troubles... That's your problem. What the hell do you want? I'll read this for you: Debtor Kevin Duan hereby promises to settle his debt of 110 million RMB to creditor Mei Xiao-Ou with interest within five days. his debt of 111 million RMB to creditor Mei Xiao-Ou with interest within five days. If the debtor fails to pay on time, the creditor retains the right to pursue legal action." My new development is on the market now. In three to five months, I can pay you back. In three to five months, I can pay you back. You've dragged this out for months. I told you I have money problems! Did you think about that when you made side bets? Why can't you help me? I've already helped you! I've given you six months! You've asked me to make side bets. If I hadn't stop you, how much would you owe me now? Why couldn't you quit when you were ahead? You have ten days! Good news. My cousin is starting to lose! Listen to me. Quit gambling right now and I'll cancel your debt for good! Just end this once and for all! After getting Duan's signature, I returned to pick up Le-Le in Sanya, where I encountered another tragic scene. Stop letting him bet, Qilan. I beg you. It's you! Duan's told me everything! Didn't he just lose a few bucks? How serious could it be? Pretending to be a reporter to get to me? She came to my home pretending to be a reporter. I can call the cops and lock you up! Mrs. Duan. Your husband lost at gambling. The rules say he has to pay. What's wrong with that? Don't tell me about rules! What do you do? Do you have the guts to tell everyone here? Do you? Why come all this way to hound us? She's lucky we don't throw the book at her! How many men have you corrupted?! This woman takes people to casinos, then cheats them out of their money. My husband's from a family of cadres! How would he know about people like you? How would he know about people like you? You set out to swindle him, and now you're harassing us. I'm warning you. If you bother Duan again, I'll make your life hell. Come with me. What's all this? Who do you think you are? Who's that man? Do any of you know him? How did you know I was here? I'll tell you later. What the hell does that mean? How did you find me? Maybe Shang is getting soft in his old age. He told me everything. Xiao-Ou, I came here to ask you to let me see my son. No. I have pancreatic cancer. It's terminal. I only have one son in this world. I have to see him. Please let me see him, Xiao-Ou. What does he look like? What's his name? Le-Le. Does he know about me at all? He does. When I die, I want to leave him everything I own. When I die, I want to leave him everything I own. Send him to the best college. He'll be fine as long as he doesn't gamble. Let me see Le-Le. I have to answer this. Xiao-Ou, my cousin's about to lose everything. Can you call back later? I wanted to share the good news. Stop, enough already. How can I stop? Le-Le! I said to wait in the lobby. Where did you go? I saw you arguing with that lady, mama. Remember how you wanted to meet your dad? Well, if your dad came to see you, would you want to meet him? Xiao-Ou, I've been a burden to you and your son all these years. That's been like a bottomless pit in my heart, but now that pit has finally been filled in. I'll wire you the money within ten days. You should quit the business. Live your life in peace. You should leave here today. Why do I always attract troublemakers like you? You know who came to see me yesterday? Who? Lu Jin-Tong. He came to see his son. When we got to Urumqi, we found out that Duan's so-called property project is all hot air. There's nothing there. All the signs indicate that Duan's funding has dried up. We have to take him to court. That's right. Sorry, I heard your lawyers arrived right after I left Urumqi. I fell seriously ill in Xinjiang. I'm in treatment right now. Can I get an extra week? I'll pay you back once I recover. I've been sending him one message a day since he missed his deadline. These are very useful for us. They can be used as evidence. They can be used as evidence. (Take care of yourself, Mr. Duan.) (We'll sort out our problems in court.) (Sorry to hear that. I'll see you in court, then.) (But remember, you're not all that clean yourself.) (You think you can hold your head high in front of a judge?) (I've done my research.) Hello? One of my men just saw a guy that looks like Duan in The Golden Dragon. Go check if it's him, then. Player has five. Banker has seven. Banker wins. Xiao-Ou. It's him. Is he playing? It was Hua. He set up a 20-fold side bet. The game he's put together has scared all the casinos in town. The game he's put together has scared all the casinos in town. Looks like Duan is going for one last hurrah. A lot of brokers want a piece of this game. I see a bunch of lackeys watching him. Why's it so crowded? Can't they wait outside? Mr. Duan, you're playing 20-fold today. Your creditors need some assurances. Fine. Let them watch me kick their bosses' asses. Let's go. Banker. Banker wins. Go tip the kids. Thank you, sir. Good luck! Go away. He's won again! He's on a streak! (I just arrived in Beijing. Can we meet?) Player. Banker. (I'm sick. Maybe after I get better.) (Can I visit you, then?) Pay up. (I'm contagious. The doctor says no visitors.) (Can I send you some gifts?) (No need. Got plenty.) (Best gift: your leniency.) Xiao-Ou? Leave him alone. Let him keep playing. Let's see if he's still arrogant when he loses everything. Letting him settle his debt to me now would be like a slap in my face. Leave him be. I stayed in contact with Cat, who kept me updated on how Duan did in every game. Go. No more bets. Player has eight. Yes! Banker has eight. It's a draw. This is his longest winning streak yet. If he leaves now, his creditors are in huge trouble. I'm on my way back now. Keep an eye on him. By the time I got off the ferry, Duan was up a hundred million, plus 20 times more in side bets. It's almost enough to cover his debt to Hua and me. I only had one thought in my head: Please walk away, Mr. Duan. No more bets. Flip 'em. Banker has eight. Great! Busted! Come on, bro, one or two is all you need. Zero for the player. Can you tell them to shut up? How many games now? Over 50. The streak's almost over. Banker. No more bets. Cards for the banker. Player has eight. Give me a moment. Sure. Security. Banker has six. Player wins. No more bets. Player has zero. Banker has zero. Player gets a card. Banker gets a card. Player has five. Banker has four. Player wins. He said he's waiting for you in his room. This is the deed to a good piece of land I own in Haikou. It's worth more than what I owe you. Take it. The deed is authentic. But here's the problem: Duan has already mortgaged the land. Judging by the date, the deed's already invalid. If we take this to court now, we'll have trouble. Duan bolted after giving me the deed. He vanished into thin air, making sure that I wouldn't be able to find him. Some say he got implicated in a scandal, and went into hiding overseas. Give that back! Give me that... You can't take that! Who are you? Three weeks after Duan went missing, his wife had a stroke. She and their daughter lost their mansion, and moved into two-room flat in the suburbs. Macau saw a large-scale reclamation project in 2011. Artificial beaches replaced natural ones. Tides once governed by Earth's rotation now seemed driven by motorization. Macau was looking newer by the day, but I was back to where I started. It's full. Just wait. Look. Waitress, clear the table. Sure thing. Two bowls of lamb soup and two roasted pancakes. - Just a moment. - Thanks. Xiao-Ou, I've got a huge development in the works. A shopping mall in Linyi, Shandong. Look, I could make billions in profit. This one deal would clear all my debts. Two bowls of lamb soup! Take a look. With my connections and experience, this project could put me back on track. What do you want from me? Bidders have to put up a deposit. I don't have enough, so I need your help. You're talking to the wrong person. Xiao-Ou, rescuing my project means rescuing the money I owe you. Mr. Duan, it's been two years since I last saw you. What have you been doing? Nothing, really. I went into hiding abroad for two years. I hear Mrs. Duan had another stroke. You should be careful. She could be in danger. Everything's changed. I'm all she has now. All she has left are your protection and love. I came back to take care of her. Enough. Can we not talk about this? Do you still gamble? For the sake of my family... I quit. Besides, I've got nothing to gamble with. Xiao-Ou. Lend me two million. Even if I fail, you'll get it back in two months. I'll pay you 10% interest each month. It was April when I finally got Shi Qilan's address. The sandstorm blanketing Beijing had traveled thousands of miles. By evening, the storm had exhausted itself and died down. Mr. Chai. Hey. Have you heard from Shi Qilan? Oh, him. He's hiding from his creditors. He showed up here one day and borrowed 200 from me. He mailed the cash back in this envelope. Luzhai township, Liuzhou, Guangxi Province. A sculptor? We haven't heard about anyone from Beijing. The postmark is from here, though. Luzhai township is miles away. Over that mountain. Sir? Sir! Can I help you? Do you know this address? It's a lumber mill. There are a few up the mountain. Ask around up there. Ma'am. Is there a lumber mill around here? Yes, it's just around the corner. Thank you. You're welcome. It's nice and peaceful here. Not even the police know you're here. So your new incarnation is a hermit? Well, losing everything was liberating. I can sculpt whatever I want. Is this me? It's not done yet. It's just a rough model. The clay here's no good. I want to make a copper cast instead. How did you find this place? How's the wife and kid? Xiao-Xiao left me two and a half years ago. She said she never wants to see me again. Told me not to look for them. Sell these to me. Why? Why what? Because I like them. How can we talk about money? Just name your price. Don't get angry at my price, then. Why would I? Xiao-Ou, if you want these, you can have them for free. I have a condition, then. What is it? I haven't touched any of the money you gave me. Use it to cover your debt down south. Then you can make a proper comeback. Now that you've quit gambling, even your scent has changed. Thanks. Aren't you going to sleep? I want to get some work done. You didn't come to bed until morning. You barely slept. Go back to bed. The way you tie your hair up reminds me of Monet's haystacks. I don't get it. Ma, where are the instant noodles? Can't you see I'm cooking already? Just wait a few minutes. Dad called me. He's in critical condition. He wants me to visit him. Again? He's been in critical condition a few times already. He doesn't even have the right to be sick? What are you crying for? I didn't say that you can't go. I'm not crying. These last few years, I've let you visit him whenever you have a holiday, right? Has your father really stopped gambling? Didn't Uncle Shi used to gamble, too? They're different. Le-Le. Xiao-Ou, Mr. Duan is at I'Arc, Xiao-Ou, Mr. Duan is at I'Arc, spending the two million you lent him. Thought you might want to go take a look. Cat, please. Deal with Duan for me. I'm in the wrong line of work. I can't do this anymore. Xiao-Ou, I wish I could. Xiao-Ou, I wish I could. Duan says he'll only pay his creditors, not a middleman like me. You have to collect from him yourself. Come on, three! Come on, four! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Mr. Duan. Let me finish this game. I didn't recognize those hands anymore. Those hands that started with humble pancakes, and went on to build skyscrapers, now folding cards like a two-bit gambler. How embarrassing. He's no longer the man he was, but he still has intensity and sophistication. He mustered up the same smile he gave me when we first met. Xiao-Ou. I was looking at some land in Zhuhai. Thought I'd play a few hands. How are you? I'm fine. I quit my job, and handed most of my clients to Cat. Xiao-Ou says I'll be handling your account from now on. He can do that? I'll lend you what you owe her first. You pay her back, then I'll collect from you. I'm still your Mr. Duan. How can you sell my debt like this? Slavery's been over for ages. Now you're selling your debtors away like slaves? The court didn't say a third party could do this. I won't let him do this. I have no connection to him! Stop fighting! Stop! You lowlife! There are cameras in here! Stop fighting! Stop. You hear me? Stop. You hear me? Stop fighting. Get him out of here. Stop. You told Xiao-Ou that two mil was for a bid! What happened to the damn bid? You made up some bullshit story and passed off a fake land deed! The deed was real! Ask her! You're right! Can I talk to Mr. Duan alone? No! Ask him if he blew the two mil "bidding" in the casino! Fine, I'll ask him myself! Back off! Hey! Tell him to pay back that two mil first! Cat had stripped away Duan's last shred of dignity. I heard that he was arrested at the airport in Beijing. His business was shut down for investigation. His unpaid debt and the home I'd mortgaged went down the drain. Passport please. Here. The boarding gate is that way. Thank you. Don't be gone for too long. Thanks. Unwrap it. The anti-graft campaign has hit Macau. Mainland tourism has dwindled. The gaming industry saw negative growth for the first time in a decade. VIP rooms, once packed, are now empty. Many of them are shutting... Xiao-Ou! Hua's disappeared. He was afraid of being dragged into Duan's case. He fled with two billion in dirty money. His VIP rooms are closed, and even Ms. Fay's in trouble. Everyone's looking for him, even Interpol. Le-Le. Melbourne police recovered a body from the beach yesterday. The victim, a Chinese man, was apparently stabbed to death two days go. The body later washed ashore. The case is under investigation. Police has found a dead body. The body has not been identified yet. However, the victim seems to be Asian. The police is gathering evidence and questioning the witnesses. - Xiao-Ou? - Cat. My friend saw Le-Le gambling with some rich kids. Who? Le-Le! Yes. Come on! Bet on the player! Deal the cards. Nine! Nine! Nine! Nine! Two on the side! Two! Two! That's enough. Seven. Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! You're doing pretty well. Go all in. Ma. Where did you get the money? Dad left it for me. How much? 200 grand. I wasn't gambling, Ma. I'm the dealer. I'm the banker! The odds are on my side! I've already won 70 grand! You and Uncle Shi want to open a gallery, right? I'm raising this money for you. What are you doing, ma? I was making the money for you! Ma... Where are you going? What are you doing? Ma! Why couldn't you inherit the good qualities? Why couldn't you inherit the good qualities? Ma! Stop it! Ma. I'm sorry! I was wrong! Please don't burn the money! It's my fault! I'm sorry! I won't do it again! Ma... please! I won't do it again! Don't touch me! Ma... Take your hands off me. Touch me again, and I'll burn this house to the ground. You hear me? Think you can make money now? It's on fire, Ma. It's on fire! Poverty drove us mad. Our ancestors were poor. It made us money-crazy. Made us not care where the money came from. Then it made us poor again. Uncle Shi! Uncle Shi! What's wrong? My mom's burning cash. Call someone! What are you doing, Xiao-Ou? Are you mad? (December, 2014.) Mr. Shi, do you have any comments about your show here in Macau? I want to thank everyone for being here. I've always wanted to have a show in Macau. Ms. Fay, you're here, too. Hello. Mr. Duan sends his regards. He said that he wasn't trying to run out on his debt. His older brother had to flee the country, so he gave your money to his brother's kids. His brother's been arrested, and Duan will be released soon. What for? He's well-fed and has a roof over his head. He should stay in there. Don't say that. He still has to pay you back. I vouched for him. I have a responsibility, too. You can give him those when he gets out of jail. I have a phone to answer. Say something, Xiao-Xiao. I know it's you. I'm busy. Qilan's gallery is opening today. Auntie Mei, please give my daddy back to my mommy. I need my daddy, Auntie Mei. I miss him... Give the phone back to your mother. My daddy's scared you'll be heartbroken, that's why he can't come back. I put a lot of emotion into each piece, but if I had to pick a favorite, it would be "Mother and Son". Listen, Xiao-Xiao. Qilan isn't a thing. You can't just throw him away and then ask for him back. Xiao-Ou, please let him come home. Please don't destroy our family. What's wrong? Have you talked to Xiao-Xiao lately? No. Why would I do that? Qilan, you and Xiao-Xiao are still legally married. You don't have to sneak around. We're doing just fine. Why did you have to mention her? I just asked a friend to tell them that I'm doing fine. So you did contact her. What do the two of us have to do with her? Xiao-Ou, I didn't talk to her. You can check my phone and e-mail. I don't even go online much. A journalist friend found out about the exhibition and told her. Ask him if you don't believe me. What are you doing? Xiao-Xiao called me. She asked me to "give you back"! She can have you! Go! You're amazing, Qilan. You just had to go behind my back and call her, didn't you? Where was she when you needed her? Where was she when you needed her? Go away! Why didn't she remember your marriage then? Now you're doing well, and she suddenly remembers. And you told her I'd be heartbroken. Why would I be? Plenty of guys want me! Don't get upset. Who's upset? Get out! Leave. She wants me to give you back, right? What are you looking for? My hat. Your hat? Who gives a shit about your damn hat? Take it. Now, go! I'm not going anywhere! Get out! What? You really think I'll be heartbroken if you go? Don't you worry. I'll be fine without you! I'll find another man. I've wanted you gone for the last two years. Why are you still here? Let me go! Ow! I'll never let anyone know how much I didn't want him to go, or how hurt I was. Shi Qilan was the last man I loved. My romantic history ends with him. I don't know why I love him. I don't know what I love about him, but I do. It must be true love. I'm on the way to the airport. Let me talk to Xiao-Ou. Xiao-Xiao wants to talk to you. Thank you, Xiao-Ou. Xiao-Xiao won't ever let you come back here. This way, everyone! Watch your step! Wait for me! Got the itch? I don't know. Quitting gambling is like quitting drinking. Avoiding it doesn't mean you've quit. Quitting means taking a drink without getting drunk. In gambling, walking away while you're ahead means you've successfully quit. I've been watching over you for two years. If I leave you alone, you'll probably gamble again. Give me 15 minutes. Place your bets. No more bets. Player has seven. Banker has six. Player wins. Your cards, sir. Ok. It's Mei Xiao-Ou. Put Qilan on! He's in the casino... You've dragged him gambling again! Your cards, sir. Banker has zero. Player has one. Player wins. He won three in a row. Here you go, sir. My winnings. Your flight's delayed. Let's take a walk. I walked away after winning three games. I've quit gambling. But the problem is, I can't quit you. What should I do? This is for you. Why are you here? To see you. Can't trust that Liu. I told him not to tell anyone, including you creditors. I'll never beg for mercy. Everyone has to die eventually. Don't worry, Liu's been taking care of your wife. It's no big deal. Someone had to take the fall. I can start feom scratch when I get out. There is nothing to be afraid of. There is nothing to be afraid of. I'll be waiting for you to repay me. Xiao-Ou... I never understood why you chose this job when you hate gamblers so much. With your smarts, you're more than qualified to be my company's vice-chairwoman.
