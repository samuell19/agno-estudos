The Dow Jones stock average dipped under 4000 points today. You see it in the market's volatllity. Violent wea th loss. If it's bad for the rich people, can you imagine how bad it is for me and you? Good evening, America, I'm Jay Knight. Our nation is slipping deeper and deeper into a crisis never seen before. Oil and gas shortages have crippled manufacturing and transportation costs... While conflicts in the Mldeast... ...have virtually cut off all oil imports to the Unlted States. Well, what are you saying? Are you saying that the American people aren't taking care of thelr own country? Global States Oil Corporation... ...suffered yet another major spill off the Gulf Coast. We're seeing an unprecedented... As a result, rail travel has reemerged as the only affordable means of frelght... ...and passengertransportatlon. Mr. Speaker, we would like to propose a bill... ...to make it Illegal to flre employees from profitable corporations. Our government has put a moratorium on all wage increases... ...and recently passed the Fair Prlce Bill... ...restricting Increases in the price of most goods and servlces. Thls is your wake-up call, America. Another government relief shlp was hijacked... ...by pirate Ragnar Danneskjold. Violence and crime are skyrocketing throughout the nation. Shifting to manual. Good evening, and we come to The Jay Knight Hour. My guests tonight are James Taggart, CEO of Taggart Transcontinental Railroad... ...Wesley Mouch, a noted Washington lobbyist... ...from the Ph ade phia law firm Young, Stephens and Sachs... ...and Ellis Wyatt, the o and gas entrepreneur... ...who is responsible for the current economic boom in Colorado. My first question is to Mr. Taggart. Sir, your company is one of the few managing to survive... ...ln our current economic downturn. Yet, there have been dozens of derailments on your lines in the last year alone. How do you explain that? With any growth there can be growing pains. People shouldn't have to worry about how they're gonna get where they need to go. We must act to benefit society as a who e. People aren't gonna be going anywhere without oll. That means the railroads like Mr. Taggart's need to be flxing their railways here... Can I get you something? A cup of coffee. He makes a very good point, Mr. Taggart. Do you have any money? I got plenty of money. Taggart Transcontinental is committed to sharing the burden... Hey, what happened to you? Who's John Galt? We don't need more rail lines. We just need the ones we have to be rellable. Well, prices are too high. We have a nation in crsis. Every business must lend a help ng hand, Mr. Wyatt. Gasol ne prices are 37.50 a gallon. The Mideast has imploded, creating a worldwide o shortage. We have plenty of oil right here In the U.S. Hello, Joy. But because of political shenanigans and back room deals... One slice of cherry pie. As usual. Punctual, as always. Thank you, dear. And Taggart Transcontinental is providlng Wyatt Oil excellent rall transportation... ...ln orderto get his oll to the people. Your Rio Norte Line is so incompetent... ...that I've had to switch to the Phoenlx/Durango. After years of excellent service from us. From yourfather. Slnce you've taken the reins, that company's gone downhill. Oil prices have caused consumers to be less reliant on trucks... Stay dry now. See you tomorrow, Mr. Mull gan. They've gone to the railroads for the benefits that they provide. People can't count on companies llke Taggart Transcontinental to dellver. Midas Mul gan? Who's asking? Someone who knows what it's ike to work for himself... ...and not let others feed off the profits of h s energy. That's funny. Exact y what I've been thinking. We're a ike, you and I. Who are you? Eddie. What? No. Uh... Hold on. Hold on. The Dow Jones stock average dipped under 4000 points today. This is the deepest one-day drop... No, not yet. I'm trying another channel. Simply one of the worst railroad accidents in recent history. A Taggart Transcontinental freight train has crashed... ...and derailed in Colorado's Rocky Mountain reglon. Early reports put much of the blame... ...on the poor conditlon of the 100-year-old railroad llne. This rail disaster could delay eastbound oil shipments by at least two weeks. The accldent is yet another downturn for Taggart Transcontlnental... ...the largest rallroad remainlng in the U.S. I'm on my way in. I already know about the derailment on the R o Norte Line, Eddie. Cance lations. People are giving up trying to use the line. Their bus ness is going to the Phoenix/Durango. I have new steel rails coming from... That order is 13 months old. The Phoen x/Durango has cut deep y into our bus ness. They expect to have Wyatt as their main account. He needs us just as much as we need h m. Ellis Wyatt has put Taggart Transcontinental on notice. He'd rather back og w th any competitor than ship anything... Wyatt's a greedy bastard. We've been serving the Colorado Reg on... ...since my great-great grandfather ran this company. What happened to loyalty? Perhaps the problem is we haven't updated that branch... ...since your father ran the company. Are you accusing me of not do ng my job? Careful, Eddie, it's one th ng I learned from my father... ...everyone's expendable. Let me be very clear, James. Colorado s our last hope. If we don't do someth ng about it, there's not gonna be a railroad. I'm still the president, regardless of my s ster... Morning. Eddie, can you give us a minute? I need to have a conversation with my brother. A meeting without your right-hand man? Must be real important. I've ordered the replacement rails from Rearden Steel. I have a contract with Orren Boyle. You had a contract with Orren Boyle. Canceled. You've no authority. As much authority as you had to do a backdoor deal with Orren Boyle. There are consequences to this accident, Jim. We have to service Ell s Wyatt. He is this company's main priorty. You just ove to keep feeding the monopolies. You keep pissing off the heart of this operation... ...Wyatt s gonna stop providing the blood we need to keep this company alive. You understand that? Why Rearden Steel? There are companies that need the money. It's his new meta. That metal's complete y untested. The consensus of the best metallurgical authorities are h ghly skept ca. I'm not interested in their opinions. Then who's do you go by? My own. And what on earth do you know about Rearden Metal? It is tougher, cheaper, lighter than stee... ...and will outlast any metal in ex stence. Says who? I studied engineering in college, Jim. When see things, I see them. What'd you see? Rearden's p ans, research he's done. This is the greatest metal on the market. Dagny, nobody's used Rearden Metal. We will. Why do we have to be the first? Do you wanna save Colorado or not? I'm not taking respons bility for any of this. You don't have to take responsibility, J m. I will. Just know that this is the consequence of your policies. Which policies? Your 13-month experiment with Orren Boyle, for one. The Mexican catastrophe, for another. The bottom ine is that... ...we are going to fix the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Meta. I'm going to Philadelphia tonight to f nalize the dea with Hank Rearden. You're lucky. What? Other people are human. They're sensitive. They can't just dedicate their whole lives to metals and engines. You've never had any feelings. I don't think you've everfe t a thing. No, Jim. I guess I've never felt anything at all. Allpassengers for Traln 1210. Taggart Transcontinental... Thanks. It's here. And it's very n ce. Gwen, it's beaut ful. You have more messages, Mr. Rearden. National Council of Metal Industries. File it. The State Science Institute. File it. Your ast appointment of the day is here. Miss Taggart? He'll see you now. Mr. Rearden? Miss Taggart. If you're here for your rails... ...they won't be tempered and cooled for a few days. I'm just here to discuss our deal. Please, sit. So, what's the premium to rush thesee rails? Forty thousand dollars a ton. That's the best price you can g ve me? I could charge you double and you'd pay. You could. And I wou d. But you won't. Why won't I? You need to have the Rio Norte rerailed with your new metal. It will be its first showcase. And I'm gambling your new metal can do what you say it can. I'm staking my business on it. I know what you mean. Like I said, we need each other. So if you can have the Rio Norte complete y rera ed in nine months... ...I w give you $20,000 a ton. Deal. I'm curious. Is t all right with you... ...that I'm squeezing every penny of profit I can from your emergency? I have to get the Rio Norte complete y rera ed in nine months... ...or Taggart Transcontinental w I crash. Doing their best to make it harder for you. Yes, but it's useless to get angry wth people... ...ike my brother and his friends in Washington. I don't have time for it. I have to undo what they've done. And after? After, they won't matter anyway. I was just heading out myself. Can I wa k you to your car? Do you need a ride? No, thank you. I walk home most nights. It gives me a chance to think. Well, I hope that doesn't catch on. It would put me out of business. If your new metal works, have you thought of the implications? Yeah. Their uses are almost endless. Naval ships, armor plating, even spacecraft. Can you imagine a commercial jet twice the size with half the weight? Commercial airlines. You real y do wanna put me out of business, huh? Remember, there was 20 peop e... I love this. I can't be ieve I did this. And then... Well, look who's finally home. Henry, Paul's been waiting here for hours. Hello, Henry. Hey, Pau. I know. I'm late. Could have called. Henry, do you mind hold ng the 10th of December open for me? That's three months away. I don't know what I'm doing next week. We started a major new pour today. Oh, cheers. It's our wedding anniversary, Henry. December 10th? Henry isn't nterested in anything that doesn't tie in to his work. I know that you are very busy... ...but I would very much ike for ycu to be there. Of course, Lillian. I'll be there. Thank you, dear. I want it to be spec al. Everyone will be there. Have you had any dinner, Henry? No, I was busy working, but I'm not hungry anyway. That's the trouble w th you. You work too hard. Mm. Ooh. What is this? I had it made from the first pour of Rearden Metal. You're giving me a ra road spike? It's wonderful. T is. It's original. I'll be the toast of the town wear ng a p ece of the same metal... ...used to bu d railroads and bridges and sewer pipes and oi tanks and... You are so self sh, Henry. Oh. Phillip, it is not the gift, it's the inteention. The intention's pure selfishness, it seeems to mee. I mean, another man wou d have given h s wfe a diamond bracelet... ...if he wanted to g ve her a gift for her pleasure, not his. No. The, uh, chain is approprate. I think it's the chain by which he holds us al in bondage. Henry's poured his metal today and I have the first trophy. It's sweet. It's pathetic, Lilly. Thank you. I hope you didn't come here for anyth ng. Henry. Ph ip. What are you doing with yourself these days? I'm working for Frends of Global Awareness. I know them. What do you want? Money. Doesn't everyone? Call my office first thing in the morning. I'll authorize a hundred grand for you. You don't care about he ping the underprvileged. No, Phill p, I don't, but it will make you happy. It's not for me, Hank. It's for the benefit of the less privileged. Do you think I can have the money w red to my account? A wire? Why? Well, the th ng is it's a progress ve group. They wouldn't appreciate your name on a check. You're k dd ng me. No. T wou d embarrass us to have you on the ist of our contributors. You shouldn't have given Phlllip that money. By the way, I don't care what the industry says, Henry. Rearden Metal, it's terrfic. I just hope you don't run into any trouble. What trouble? Well, you're not very popu ar, Hank. I haven't had any comp aints from my customers. Yeah? That's not what I mean. You know what you should do? You ought to get yourself a good press agent to sell you to the public. It's my metal I'm sell ng. Not me. Thank you. But you don't want the pub ic against you. Public opinion, you know, can mean a lot. As far as I can tell, it doesn't mean a damn thing, one way or another. The press is against you. They have time to waste. I don't. Well, they say you're intractable, you're ruthless. Your only goal is to make money. My only goa is to make money. Yeah, but you shouldn't say it. Hank, I'm on your side. How's your man in Washington? Wesley Mouch? Well, he's fine, I suppose. Good. It's important that your man in Washington is fine. What are you try ng to imply, Paul? Is there something going on that I shou d know about? No. It's nothing. It's just you don't know who's loyal these days. What is wrong with the word, Paul? Why ask useless questions? How deep is the ocean? How high s the sky? Who is John Galt? Henry Rearden claims that his steel is lighter than even the cheapest brands... ...but it's 10 times stronger. This is physically mpossible, Jim. You're nv ting disaster if you use t. Dagny is, not me. Well, something has to be done. Agreed. I be ieve you know Wesley Mouch, Rearden's man in Washington. You know what I like about you, Wesley? You're a one-word man. True. All right, something has got to be done about the iron ore shortage. It threatens the very existence of the stee industry. I don't think it's fair that one company has its own supply. Rearden Steel. Exact y. It's not n the public interest to let one man destroy an ent re industry. If we're gonna bring Rearden down we shou d do it from the inside. Under my guidance, of course. The Nat onal Council of Metal Industries has completed a report... ...that draws public opinion against Rearden Metal. Excuse me. I just wanna make sure that Hank doesn't get hurt. Paul, it's his own fault. He's not exactly open to compet tion. A monopo y. To be exact. We are work ng on a bill. It's ca ed The Equalization of Opportun ty. It proposes to limit the number of businesses... ...that any one person owns to one business. However, we're gonna need your help, Jimmy. We need you to grease the palms of your politicians... ...in order to get legislation we're spearheading passed. What will Taggart Transcontinental get in return? I can see to it that the exclus ve grip... ...that Dan Conway's Phoenix/Durango railroad has in Co orado... ...can come to a halt. Paul, th s is not personal. Everybody needs to share the burdens we facee. Espec ally Rearden. Isn't that Francisco D'Anconia? That's him. Francsco. Throwing away his daddy's money. Did you get in on that ore mine deal in Meex co? We all did. He may be a slacker, but he makes business investments that pay off. Well, that's it for me, gentlemen. I have to go too. Um, Mr. Taggart. Orren. Uh, Pau, uh, maybe you'd like a lift in my I mo? Of course. Thank you. Please. This way. Gentlemen. Good night, Paul. Orren. Wesley. Jim? What is it? Well, if he's such a great bus nessman... ...then why hasn't a single train filled with ore left Mexico yet? Isn't that what we invested in? D'Ancon a has invested b lions developing their infrastructure. But he also bought in himself. He must know something. What are you thinking? I think t's the ore reserves. I think they must be huge. Well, the success of my Mexican expansion depends on those m nes, Orren. Uh, sure. This t me next year, Phoenix/Durango needs to be a memory. Thank you, Mr. McNamara. I ook forward to working with you as well. McNAMARA: Frankly, I appreciate working directly with you. My pleasure. Goodbye. McNAMARA: Goodbye. Who was that? I found an excellent contractor to takeover the rebuilding of the Rio Norte Line. That was quick. You'd be surprised how quickly things get done when you do some actual work... ...and don't re y on political favors. Is this accurate? Just one passenger tra n per day on the Mexican ine? And one freight every other n ght? Yes. How are the Mex cans gonna deve op the area... ...with a s ngle passenger train once a day? They're not, J m. You should know I moved everything of va ue out of Mexico a month ago. There's nothing for looters once the Mexicans nat onalize. That Mexican line was helping those destitute people get back in the game. And it was great PR for this company. I would have happily put a rai road in Mexico... ...f there was a reason to build up the region... ...but I d dn't see one. You can't just take everyth ng away from people who need our help. Move. Okay. Miss Taggart? Oh. Hello, Owen, please, have a seat. Thank you. Um... I've have come to give you my resignation. Effective immediate y. Why? For a personal reason. Are you dissatisf ed here? No. Have you received a better offer? No. I'm sorry, I don't understand, are you II? No. Are you leaving the city? No. But you no longer wish to work for Taggart Transcontinenta? Miss Taggart, I assure you... ...um, no person, matter or event connected to my job... ...has anything to do with my decision to leave. I actually ca ed you in here today to offer you a promotion. I wanted you to manage the Rio Norte Line. That's very kind of you, M ss Taggart... ...but, um, my dec sion has been made. I' double what any other railroad is offering. I won't be working for any railroad. But you will be working? Yes, um... Look, I came to tell you I'm leaving... ...because I promised you once that I would and I wanna keep my word. Write your own ticket, Owen. Name your prce. I want you to stay. I'm sorry, g?ice Taggart. So there's nothing I can offer you? Noth ng, nothing on Earth. I'm sorry, Owen, I have to ask and I'd I ke the truth. Why are you leaving? Who is John Galt? All done then? Where are you going? I have some work to do. Fix me a drink? Of course. Miss Taggart? Am I calling too ate? Not at all. What's go ng on? Nothing. Well, um... ...something. I don't know why I thought of calling you. It's flne, Dagny. What happened? One of my best employees quit today. Owen Kellogg. I was actually grooming him for a management position... ...and he just up and left. He cou dn't even tell me why. He just sa d: Why are so many great men disappearing? It's going to be okay, Dagny. You know, when you say that, I actually believe it. Dagny, what we're doing... ...my metal, your railway... It's us who move the world... ...and It's us who will pull It through. I know. Goodnight. Goodnight. Richard McNamara? I'm McNamara. Are you here from Taggart Transcontinental? No, I'm not. What are you selling, pal? Nothing, I'm simply offering a society that cult vates individua ach evement. I know where such a p ace exists. And then we do what? We say its purpose is to prevent destruct ve competition between ra Iroads. We build public opinion... ...against encroachment on existing train routes then... And then the Nat onal Alliance of Ra Iroads proposes a rule. The Anti Dog-Eat-Dog rule. Every member must subordinate... ...his own nterests for the collective needs of the industry. But, in fact, we're squeezing Dan Conway out of Colorado. You are think ng like a po itician, Jimmy. Mexican authorities seized land throughout the country today. Most affected were the San Sebastian Mlnes... ...where international playboy Francisco D'Anconia... ...and other investors, including Taggart Transcontinental... ...and Associated Steel have reportedly lost billions. The San Sebast an Line has been seized by the Mexican government. It's been national zed as Dagny predicted. An emergency board meeting has been ca ed. I can assure you that there is no need for panic. And have fu I confidence that our government... ...will negotiate an equitable settlement with Mexico. I foresaw the poss bility of this type of event... ...and took every precaution to protect the interests of Taggart Transcont nental. Severa months ago, ordered Operations to cut the schedulee... ...on the San Sebastian Line down to a s ngle train a day... ...and to remove everyth ng of value from Mexico. Now, because of my actions... ...b I ions of company dollars have been saved. No, this is no trick. I checked it al out, Jimmy. D'Ancon a used h s own cash and now he has lost t all in those mines. He is too smart for that. He must have something up his sleeve. Well, let's hope so. What do your friends n Washington think? They don't know anything. Well, he knows something. And we need to find out what it is and get in on t too. Ruth Anne, why haven't you gotten me a meeting with D'Anconia yet? I wasn't able to get a meeting. Why not? Senor D'Anconia says that you bore him, Mr. Taggart. Yeah, okay, yeah. There's someth ng e se, Dagny. There was a call just now from the Rio Norte branch in Colorado. Richard McNamara never showed up for work. Well, go f nd h m. Well, we've looked and we found a note. What did it say? It said, "'Who s John Ga t?" What does that mean? Was explained once. "Don't ask quest ons nobody can answer." Can you get Hank Rearden for me? He actually called earlier. He's in town and he wants to know if you're availab e. And what did you say? He's meeting you at 4:30. Thanks, Eddie. We need to talk. You guys carry on, I'll catch up. You think I've ruined this company. Do you and Orren Boyle have a plan for making up for the Mexican line's losses? Yes, I do. The Anti Dog-Eat-Dog rule. Wyatt will have to use Taggart Transcontinental... ...because we will be the only railroad in town. The Phoenix/Durango is a good line, Jim. Conway put h s lifeblood into its success. You have to take radica steps to surv ve. What does that mean? Go see your o d boyfriend, Francisco... ...find out why he screwed us out of b ions of dollars? It will never happen. You'll never open those old wounds. Get me Dan Conway. I'm El s Wyatt. How can I help you? I'll make this qu ck. I came here today because, well, I met your brother... ...and I was hoping someone in this business still had a brain. If you and your brother try to undermine me... ...or go to the government like you did to destroy my best friend, Dan Conway... Maybe you should let me explain... Maybe you should let me f nish speaking! Okay. Dagny? Okay. Now that you have effectively closed down the Phoenix/Durango railroad line... ...because of this new Anti Dog-Eat-Dog bullshit... ...I have no choice but to get back into business with you Taggarts aga n. I had nothing to do with the creation of that bill. I will not lower my business standards to your ousy level of incompetence. Shall I explain what I intend to do n... No. Now that I'm forced to use your ra road... ...all I want from you is dependable transportation. You will get the transportation you need, Mr. Wyatt. I prom se you that. We' see. Is everything all right, Dagny? I don't know. Eddie? Yes, Dagny? Can you get me a dinner appointment with Francisco D'Anconia? What about Henry Rearden? I guess I have two dinner dates then. In the end, he's rght. If Wyatt fails, Taggart Transcontinental and everyone else around h m goes down. I have 50 miles of my new rail tempered and ready to roll. With your new rail, I can triple my load capacity but I need more diese engines. I barely have enough parts to keep the ones I have work ng now. Hmm. Engine parts are hard to come by these days. I have engines I ordered two years ago and still have not received. There was a company that made terrif c engines years ago... ...uh, in Wiscons n, I think. It closed suddenly, but they might have machine tools and parts that you can use. I can look into it f you like. Theree s so much at stake. We have to make it. Did you get L I ian's invitation to our anniversary party? I did, thank you. I can't speak for James, but I will be there. Good. Did you hear about R chard McNamara? I did. Can you imagine what will happen if this trend continues? Who w I be left to keep things running? Your brother and his friends in Washington, people like that. That's depressing. I have to go. Ha, ha. Whoo! That was refreshing. If you came here in order to rem nd me how lovely you are... ...well done. San Sebastian, you did it cold-bloodedly and with full intention. W ne, please? No. Yes. What s it that I d d with full ntention? You knew those mines were worthless. Why d d I invest? Can you think of a motive? You knew they were gonna se ze those mines, d dn't you? What you were after were your American stockholders. That's part of the truth. What s the rest of the truth? It's for you to figure out. And here you are, sir. I came here because I want you to know I'm beginning to understand your motives. If you did, you wou dn't come. You get a thrill from swindling people in order to watch them squirm. They provided a spectacle on a grand scale, especially your brother. He trusted your name and your honor. They did, they did. I'm aware of that. Do you find this amusing? Not at all. Your brother and h s friends know nothing of the copper min ng industry. They consider knowledge to be superf uous. So you did betray them intentionally? That's for you to decide. They rode on my brain and on the premise that I wanted to make money. What happened to you, Francisco? Where is the man I used to love? You'll figure it out n time. Just answer the quest on, please. Who is John Galt? Plans for a rainy day, national... Happy anniversary. I know you're famous for skulking in corners, but be sociable ton ght. For once, please, for me. The Equalization of Opportunity Bill is set to appear before Congress next week. The blll, In an effort to control big business monopolies, proposes... ...to limit the number of businesses any one person can own to one. Lawmakers feel the bill wlll help... Wes ey Mouch, please. Hank Rearden. Police have no leads on the disappearance of Midas Mulligan. He's not? A banker by trade, Michael... No, have him call me back. Changed his name to Midas... Can I have one n ght? Thls week, gas prices reached a historic hlgh. And here you are, Mr. Rearden. Thank you. You're quite welcome. Oh, darling, thank you. Where are you going? Pardon us, Phillip. Henry, dear... ...try to have fun. How could I possibly have more fun than this, L Ilian? You're really a wretched liar, aren't you? Behavee. Mother? You look beautiful, Mother. Hello, Lillian. Congratulations. Pardon me one moment. Hello. James Taggart. Lillian. A litt e ate and a ot gorgeous. And Dagny. Mrs. Rearden, how are you? I'm wonderful. Tell me, who are you wearing? Oh, Lennon Couture. I have ofteen said... ...he is someone who should come back into fashion and here you are. That is a beautiful bracelet. Yeah. Well, you know, Henry had that made for me from his new meta. He tries, poor thing. Now, come. There's some gentleman who wants desperately to meet you. Here he is, as promised, James Taggart. Hank. Dagny. Oh, excuse me. To a successful business partnersh p. I'll drink to that. Glad you could make it. Pardon me. Honey, uh, there's someone I want you to meet. Excuse us. You have to pose for photos later. No. You promised. You will do it, I own you tonight. I'm having a magnificent time. Good, I'm so glad. Are you glad? Here... Okay, what the hell is he doing here? Well, you can't have a party without inviting Senor D'Anconia if he's around. You keep him away from me. I mean it. Grow up, Henry. Francisco. L ian. Pardon me. How are you? You rogue. Good to see you. Two, please. Did you hear? Balph Eubank is here. Good. He sa d, "Happiness is a delusion of those whose emot ons are superf cia." The guy is a gen us. Who are you? I'm Phillip Rearden. Thank you. Well, congratulations on your 10th anniversary. Cheers. Hit it. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Try the cake, Ph I ip. Well, what's great about it? Okay, Paul? Well said. I picked it out because I know that you love banana... ...and I like chocolate and Mother I kes the butter cream. Mr. Rearden, allow me to introduce myself. Your reputation precedes you, Senor D'Anconia. I'm not a fan. Then I'll be brief. I came here tonight just to meet you. And what d d you wanna meet me for? Help me lose money? I don't wanna sell anything to you. Matter of fact, I didn't try to sell the mine to James Taggart either, he came to me. You wouldn't have. Exactly. So, what do you want? I want to learn to understand you. What for? If it wasn't for you, most of these people would be left help ess. Why are you willing to carry them? Because they'ree a bunch of miserable children... ...trying to stay alive desperate y and very badly. Have you told them? To d them what? You're working for your sake, not the rs. They know. Yes, they do. But they don't think you do. And what do I care what they think? Because it's a battle. A battle in wh ch one must make onee's stand clear. What battle? Don't f ght the disarmed. Oh, they have a weapon against you. It's their on y weapon, but it's a terrible one. Ask yourself what it is sometime. There's a reason you're as unhappy as you are. What exactly s your motive here? Let us say... ...to give you the words you need for the time when you'll need them. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Rearden. Good evening. Are you having a good time, Dagny? I am. Good. And I really do ove that bracelet. I would throw it into the fire if t would burn. Perhaps, I can take t off your hands? Are you serious? Was plann ng on g ving t to the maid for her birthday. Maybe the maid wou d I ke this instead. That's enough, Lillian. Dagny is just being kind. For God's sake, Henry, be quiet. Dagny and I are having a negotiation, it seems. You were saying? A simple trade. That bracelet for this necklace. And it's yours. Sorry, Hank, I had to. No, you didn't. Yes, I did. And we both know why. It's nothing. It's just a useless hunk of metal. Nice try. I had a lovely time. That party took a lot out of me, Henry. Don't worry. I didn't come in heree for sex. Thank you, dear. Why are you here? The next time you decide to throw a party, can you stick to your own crowd? Don't bother inviting people you think are my friends. But, Henry, you don't have any friends. And in Colorado thls morning... ...work commenced to replace 100-year-old track on the Rio Norte Llne... Some sections of this rail line, one of Taggart's most important... ...have fallen into disrepair over the last decades. The ralls of the Rlo Norte Line have not been replaced in over 100 years. This marks the first tlme Rearden Steel has been used this extensively... ...in a major railroad construction project in the country. Going slow and safe, slow and safe. Get two men on that side. Pull the pin. Your speech at this dinner tonight better inspire conf dence. The Nat onal Council of Meta Industries... ...s quest oning the structural ntegrity of Rearden Meetal. I just hope you can defend Rearden Metal against Bertram Scudder. Scudder? You didn't tell me there would be other speakers. Wee want to be objective, hear all sides. Especially in front of the med a. Objective? Did you read the hatchet job he did on Hank Rearden in his magazine? And why is there media at a prvate dinner? You're gonna debate Scudder on the safety concerns of Rearden Metal. Driver? Pull over. What are you doing? I don't need to defend my dec sion to use Rearden Metal. But, apparent y, you do. Good luck. How s it gonna look when we're not there to defend our own proposa? Taggart construction crews reached the foot of The Rockies this morning. Over 125 miles of track have been replaced in little over a month... ...with still almost 200 miles more to go. This is Tawny Johnson reportlng from Granby, Colorado. Ease off on that, big bro. The State Science Inst tute... ...is simply requesting that you stop product on... ...until the economy can stabilize. The answer s no. At a time of desperate stee shortages... ...we can't afford to allow the expans on of a company which produces too much... ...and might rep ace companies which produce too little. That is how you create an unbalanced economy. Oh. Well, I tel you what. If you can answer me one simple question truthfully... ...l'll consider your request. Is Rearden Metal good or not? I'm authorized by the government to pay you a very generous sum... ...for the rghts to Rearden Metal. What would seem fair to you? Tel me if Rearden Metal is good or not and I'll sell you the rights. I think that's a very selfish question to ask at a time of great economic uncertainty. Is Rearden Metal good or not? Answer the quest on, doctor. The question of Rearden Metal being good or not is rrelevant. If Rearden Metal is not good, it's a physical danger to the public. If it is good... ...t's a social danger. If you have any proof that Rearden Metal poses a physical threat... ...show it to me. Otherwise, we're done here. Why is it so mportant for you to struggle for years squeezing out meager gains... ...rather than accept a fortune for Rearden Metal? Because it's mine. Do you understand that concept? M ne. Why are you taking such a hard-line position? I don't understand. I don't think you'll ever understand, doctor. And Rearden Metal is good. I can't risk mak ng more sw tches for ycu... ...out of that unproven metal. Too many people think it's unsafe. What peop e? I just don't want any trouble. Herbert, look. You've been work ng with Rearden Metal for four months now. You know it is the best materal available. What's go ng on? I got a fam y. I need to make money. I'm trying to survive here. And you will. Continue manufacturing my main ne switches. There have been threats. Who is threatening you? The State Science Inst tute has issued a statement... ...warning people against the use of Rearden Metal. And what are they say ng, exactly? It's what they're mplying. It was ssued under your name. Make it a habit of letting the Institute speak for you... ...even if the words it uses are false? Miss Taggart, it is publ c opinion that Rearden Metal is unsafe. What about the truth? That Rearden Metal is the best materal ava lab e on the market today. It's strong, it is safe. You know that. Please, have a seat. Please. Cons der my s de, g?ice Taggart. I work for the ast center of science left on Earth. We do rely on public funding. Which do I sacrifice? An excellent piece of sme ting or the future of this institute? Miss Taggart. Please sit down. I had threee brilliant students... ...that I shared with another Ph osophy professor, Hugh Akston. Doctor Stadler, I don't understand what this has to do... We eeven had a bet. Who would win over their hearts and minds first? One of them became a depraved playboy. His name was Francisco D'Anconia. I know who he s. The second, Ragnar Danneskjo d, became a pirate... ...stealing to g ve to the rich. And the third? The third one simply vanished. We were expecting such a magnificent future for them. I do wish you best of luck, g?ice Taggart. Sorry, I'm late. Please, continue. Today, the Rio Norte Line... ...completed 211 miles of replaced track using the new Rearden Steel. According to studies, Rearden's new steel, mined with the latest standard... Thls extensively In a major rallroad constructlon project in the country. Hello, Dagny. Mr. Wyatt. He o. There was a big-rig p eup a couple of weeks ago. Landslide closed down the supp y line for workers and the rail. I thought we'd be down for a couple of weeks. We were back up and running in 24 hours. I figured someone knew how to manage a crsis up here. Nice job. Can't afford to fall behind. We have to geet those rai s in place before the first snows come. I underestimated you. Hey, Dagny? If you ever want a job... I'll keep that in mind. It comes from the reservoir. Make sure it's clean. I was watching you with the workers there. You look as at home there as you do in that office of yours. I'm needed here. This is important. Yeah, go ahead. What you need is to replace that brdge. Not a chance. I have to be ready in six months. Plenty. What f I told you I could have it made in three months... ...and that it would last for ceenturies? Let me check my budget. I can make it happen. Now, I'm staying in town ton ght. I was wondering if you'd like join me for dinner. I can't. I have to get back to New York. But walk with me. Do you think it can be stopped? This new line or us? Both. What's going on, Edd e? Ben Nea y's quit. Kel ogg, McNamara, now Nealy. That's not all, Dagny. Taggart Transcontinental stocks have plummeted... ...because the State Science Inst tute has denounced Rearden Metal. Your family's railroad is in rea trouble. Eddie. I think it's time to stand on our own. In order to save my family's business... ...l'm gonna have to abandon it. Good morning, g?ice Taggart. Taggart Transcontinental is done. What are you ta king about? We're f nished. We can't stop and we can't go on. In weeks. Our stock won't be trading anymore. You're paranoid. Orren Boy e has assured me there is pending... Here's what we are gonna do. And, J m, this is not a proposal. Just listen and accept. I'm gonna take a leave from Taggart Transcontinental. Start my own company. You're leaving? Shut up. You and the board are gonna transfer the Rio Norte L ne over to me. Our stock will go back up. I w I act as my own contractor. I wi I get my own financing and finish the line on t me. And where are you gonna get financing? That is not for you to worry about. Once we see how the rails perform... ...I will transfer the ine back over to Taggart Transcontinental... ...and return to my job. Okay. And what are you gonna call this new I ne of yours, Dagny? You're not dragging the family name through this. I won't allow it. The John Galt Line. Now we know why you've gone off the rails. That's the name. It's your disaster. And what's the plan if you fail? I go down alone. Taggart Transcontinental remains in your contro. Two last things. What? First, I'm taking Eddie W I ers. Oh, no, no. I need him here. Tough. You're gonna have to do your own work. Second, keep your cron es in Washington off my back. Make sure I get a my permissions, grants, authorizations... ...and any other political crap I need from those sons of b tches, otherwise, no deal. I'll see what I can do. And one last warning, brother dear. I have never done anything to hurt a ving creature in my entire life. But if you double-cross me in any way... ...I w destroy you. The money would mean nothing to you. You've wasted that on sense ess parties. You've wasted more in the San Sebastian mines. I'm afraid I can't. Money's tight. I've got too many expenses. Okay. So, what do you want me to do, Frisco? Do you want me to beg? Because now 'm begging. Ha. You don't know how. I thought that you of all people would understand. Then is it me that you want? Don't ask me such a thing, Dagny. If I ever meant anything to you... ...loan me the money that I need. I can't. What s this savior I ne gonna be ca led? The John Galt Line. What? Because I am tired of hearing that name. It means quitt ng, giving up. And am not giving up. I am not going to quit. I'm going to win. I'm sorry, g?ice Taggart. So, what do you think? Just one ast thing. I'll make sets for you. No. Okay. So maybe you can see about an opportunity... Dagny? Ken Danagger. I have some good news. Mr. Rearden, g?ice Taggart is... As president of the John Galt Line... ...I would like to commiss on a Rearden Metal brdge for Wyatt Junction. Excellent. I'll start roll ng the metal. Aren't you curious as to how I'm able to finance this? Okay, I'll bite. Ellis Wyatt, Ted Nie sen, Lawrence Hammond, Kenneth Danagger. I'm not at 100 percent bonds sold yet, but I am close. Hmm. There. I just made up the d fference. I would never ask anyone to take a risk I wasn't will ng to take. You're a good man, Hank Rearden. Can I show you something? Mr. Rearden's office. No, he's in a meeting. May I give you his vo cemail? Thank you. Looks ike an engine. Not like any engine I've ever seen. Where did you f nd this? Remember that motor company I was telling you about in Wisconsin? I did a ittle digging around and I found these. Twent eth Century Motor Corporation. It's a prototype for a new engine. It never went nto production. I'm not even sure the th ng works. Well, it's worth a look. Once the John Galt line is comp ete, I'd like to look into th s further. Care to help? Let me see what I can do. Abso utely. I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Rearden. There's an urgent call on line two. Hank Rearden. What? Find Mouch. What is it? The leg slature passed the Equa ization of Opportunity Bill. So quickly? How is that even poss ble? I don't know. You know what this means? Nobody can own more than one company. We'll f x this. I'll sign away my other companies, but they are not getting my metal. What about Wyatt's bridge? I gave my word. It will be done on time and on budget. This is just a technicality. Hank. Okay. I'll always consider the ore mine as yours. No. I either own the property or I don't. You can trust me. You know you'll always have as much ore as you need. I don't know. I've never g ven you any reason to mistrust me. The mine is yours. If you intend to keep your word, then keep t. If you wanna give me f rst call on the ore produced, f ne. If you intend to double-cross me... ...so be it. It's not fair, Hank. It wasn't me who passed the aw. That s correct. The first train on the John Galt Line will run July 22nd. Great news. Thank you, Dagny. My pleasure, thank you. Dagny, this is, uh, Mr. Brady, a delegate from the Union of Locomotive Eng neers. You're busy. I'I be brief. We're not gonna allow you to run that train. Get out of here. You do not come and tell me what you wi I or will not allow me to do. What I meant to say was a committee decided... ...that allow ng men to run your train on that untested metal... ...would violate their human rights. Are you serious, Mr. Brady? You can't force men to go out and get killed for profit. Put that in writing. That you want to stop your men from working and earning a wage. Miss Taggart, you don't understand... Oh, no, no, no. I understand perfectly. You want me to provide the jobs... ...and you wanna make it mpossib e for me to have any jobs to provide. You can do whatever you want with your men. But that tra n will run if I have to drive myself. Because, Mr. Brady, if that bridge collapses... ...there won't be any railroad eft in existence. But if it does not co lapse... ...no member of your union will ever get a job... ...on the John Ga t Line. Now are you going to forb d your men to run that train? I neveer used the word forb d. I'm on y stating that you cannot force anyone to take that run. I would never force a man to do anything. I'll ask for volunteers. Then it will be my problem, not yours. I'll advise them to refuse. Do what you want, Mr. Brady. But leave them the choicee. We have breaklng news from Cheyenne, Wyoming... ...where the maiden run of the John Galt Line Is about to commence... ...despite numerous warnings from the State Science Institute. Two hundred ffty miles per hour a I the way. The John Galt Line's the future of rail travel. We're gonna prove it today. Miss Taggart, who is John Galt? We are. One hundred. One ffty. One seventy-f ve. Two fifty. That's faster than any train has ever gone in th s country. There she is. We did it. Today in Colorado, the John Galt Line made a successful run... ...over its new Rearden Metal bridge. The controversial metal bridge held up perfectly... ...despite strong warnlngs from the State Science Institute. Three hundred miles in less than 90 minutes. Was there ever any doubt? No, because there was no doubt I prepared a meal for the two of you. Orren Boyle is on the line. Did you see? I'm watching it now. If the John Galt Line succeeds, it's gonna make Wyatt unstoppable. Now, what can be done? Don't you see? It's his own success that provides us the tools to bring him down. He's not only given us the rope, he's tied the knot. All we have to do is slip it over h s head. This might work to our advantage. I love it. Here we go. Oh, yeah, you want that. So? And he said. "It smells like museo de las pooplas." I want to tell both of you something. Do you know the Buena Esperanza Pass? Well, yeah, the Buena Esperanza Pass. That area has been dry for years. Ah. To conventional drilling, yes. There is an untapped reservoir of oil in those rocks... ...which is larger than any known reserve in the Saud Peninsu a. And underneath is an ocean of natural gas. Soon everyone will be wanting to get on the bandwagon. And, my frends, we are the band. I will drink to that. Hear, hear. To Co orado and the New Renaissance. And forget about the Stone Age and the Iron Age. Let's have a toast to the Age of Rearden Metal. And the John Galt Line. Ahem. Well, I can see that the market has opened in Hong Kong. I have some phone calls to make. You have been charming company, but I must excuse myself. There are guest rooms upstairs. Help yourse f. Thank you for everything. My pleasure, partner. S r. Sir. My, uh, casa es su casa, and so on. Good n ght. Good n ght. Good n ght. It's good to know there are men I ke Wyatt left n the world. I wish I could hold myself in the same esteem. I have a w fe. And somewhere I have a company that's being pulled apart. Yet here we aree. And al I wanna do right now is kiss you. What's stopping you? Ellis Wyatt? Yes? Could I have a moment of your t me? At this hour? Who the hell are you? My name is familiar to you. Good morn ng. Where's Wyatt? Morning. You're up early. I didn't want to wake you. Look at this. He thanked us and he's looking forward to the Second Renaissance. That's it. Odd. Mm-hm. So I was thinking. I thought we might take a trip, a ittle getaway. How scandalous. You're a married man. There you go, s r. Where are we going? You remember that folder with the strange engine? Yeah. I thought we might vis t the Twentieth Century Motor Company in W sconsin. It's a real mystery why the Twent eth Century Motor Company failed. It's no mystery. Bad ideas brought it down. Ideeas? As I understand it, the company flattened the wage scale... ...and stil paid everyone according to their needs... ...not according to their contribut ons. Why all these stup d altruistic urges? T's not being charitable or fair. What s it with people today? So after a short while, no surprise... ...the smartest managers and the better workers left the company. But hundreds of remaining staff couldn't handle it alone. Service dropped... ...quality in their once-great products was gone, and that was that. The Twentieth Century Motor Company went under. That's depressing. Looks ike they just wa ked away. Not much heere. It's too bad. I'd really ike to figure out what happened here. Dagny. This is it. This is where they made the engine. Do you th nk it's here? Why would they leave all this stuff here? Some of this is incred bly sophisticated. It's unbel evab e. Hank? Atmospherc vacuum. What? This motor uses the Casimir effect. It's this small particle accelerator. It throws sma helium particles into heavier particles. And this must be a secondary cooling system. Probab y designed to el minate excess heat generated during the process. Exact y, and this creates a magnetic fie d in place long enough... ...for the collapsing vacuum pressure to be captured. An engine that uses atmospheric vacuum to create stat c electricity. Now, does it say anywhere on this document who designed this thing? I don't see any names. We could get a list of the bu ding employees. We'd go to the town hall of records. Find the ast owner of the factory. We'd track it back from there. Dagny, this could change the world. That factory has had a ong line of owners and the records are not complete. I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay. So I guess this s our start ng point. I bought it n a bankruptcy sale. From a guy named Eugene Lawson. Do you got any idea how we might contact Mr. Lawson? He's in Washington now. At the Bureau of Economic Planning and Nationa Resources, I think. My goa is socia progress, un versal prosperity. Welfare of the nation is my pr mary consideration... ...to which I wou dn't hes tate to sacrif ce anyone's profit. Well, Mr. Rearden, you must be awfully proud of your man Mouch. He's doing big things in Colorado to help the nat on. I no onger have interest in Mr. Mouch. Oh. I see. Well, that's, uh... That's too bad. Jed Starnes. Excuse me? Jed Starnes. He was an eng neer at the Twentieth Century Motor Company. I hope that he ps. My father was an evil man. But surely, he must have mentioned something about work? A motor perhaps? The chief engineer was W iam Hastings. He quit the day after we introduced the plan. You'll find him in Brandon, Wyoming. My husband died five years ago, g?ice Taggart. Did he eveer mention a motor he created? It was h s young assistant. William always said he was, oh. Ahead of his time. Called him a genius. Do you know where we might be able to find that man today? Oh, I have no idea. He did keep in touch with a professor that he had at the Patrick Henry Univers ty. Hugh Akston was his name. I know that name. Do you know where he is? Well, Mr. Akston was rumored to have opened a roads de diner near Cheyenne. I gotta get back to my mills. Now? I have a business to run. We can't quit now, Hank. You're so c ose. Imagine what will happen f we find the inventor and get it up and running. Okay, give me a few days. I'll meet you in Colorado. Hi, Dagny. Hank. I'm back. I just want to see how you're doing. I'm great. I'm heading up to Akston's d ner now. Eddie on the other line, I'll call you back. Hey, Eddie, what's up? The Union of Locomot ve Engineers is demanding... ...that all trains on the John Galt Line be reduced from 100 to 60 miles an hour. If we don't comply, as of right now... ...Wyom ng, New Mex co, Arizona and Utah are not allowing any trains into Colorado. This is madness. That's not all, Dagny. Orren Boyle is campaigning for a b... ...that would limit the production of Rearden Metal. Is that my sister on the phone? Let me talk to her. Where the hell are you? Do you have any idea what's happening here? Jim, this s your battle. I've fought mine. They're your frends. You stop them. Dr. Akston, I was wondering if you remember a young engineer... ...who worked at the Twent eth Century Motor Corporation about 10 years ago. He worked w th a man named W I iam Hastings. Could you tell me where to find him? Does this car get good m eage? Is he still alive? Is there anything that you can tell me? I've traveled a very long way to be here. Yeah. You got a long way to go too. Excuse me. I have to be heading home. Dr. Akston? One more question. I need the name of your student who worked at Twentieth Century Motor... I know why you're here, g?ice Taggart. Do you? The secret you're try ng to solve, it's greater... ...and I mean much greater than an engine that runs on atmospheric electricity. Good luck. I'm not gonna give up trying to find the nventor of that motor. Oh, don't worry, g?ice Taggart. He' I find you. You all set? Yeah. Okay. The Equallzatlon of Opportunity Laws. Coffee? Yes. Anything else? We got rhubarb pie. Made it myself. No, I'm good. Thanks. Agaln, I thlnk it's slgnificant In helping the broad spectrum... Cou d you turn that up, please? Government is overstepping its bounds? Colorado is a rich state. It's quite unique. It's in a position where it can help lts neighborhood needier states. So I think it's a good thing, yes. And It's fair to penallze one state? Please. You're not penallzing another state. You're helping another state. Like a Robln Hood of taking from the rich, feeding the poor. I mean, rich people are gettlng rlcher. Poor people are gettlng poorer. I heard about what Orren Boyle is up to. Call me. Breaklng news out of Wyatt Junction, Colorado. A major fire has erupted at the Wyatt Oil Field. Reports are coming In that several explosions have rocked the hillslde. Our news team has captured this unedited footage on the scene. As you can see, the hlllside behlnd me is completely engulfed in flames. Fire crews have been brought In from as far away as Denver County... ...to help battle the blaze, as many as 40 acres... And zero contalnment at the moment. My fellow Americans, Mr. Wesley Mouch. Thank you. Thank you. As the new coordinator... ...of the Bureau of Economic P anning... ...and National Resources... ...I have issueed a set of directives. I am placing a morator um on a I railroad lines. Add tional y, under my direct on... ...all stee mills must produce steel at the same level and output... ...and distr bute it accord ng to the needs of the people. Furthermore, big compan es will no onger be permitted... ...to abandon their present states and move to wealthier states like Colorado. Finally, a federal tax will be applied to the state of Colorado... ...in order to equa ize the national economy. Thank you. He gave a good speech. Thank you very much. Thank you. Welcome to my town, James. Move it. Lady, stop. You can't go in there. Ellis. Ellis. Ellis. Ellis Wyatt? Who the hell are you? My name is John Galt. I live In a place we call Atlantis. And I think you'd fit in there. It's a place where heroes live. And where those who want to be heroes llve. The government we have there... ...respects each of us as indivlduals and as producers. Actually, beyond a few courthouses, there's not much of a government at all. Bottom llne, Mr. Wyatt... ...lf you're weary of a government that refuses to limlt power over you... ...and If you're ready to clalm the moral right to your own life... ...then we should leave. And I'll take you there. I'll take you to Atlantis. No! This is Ellis Wyatt. I'm gone. Don't try to find me. You won't. I am on strike.
