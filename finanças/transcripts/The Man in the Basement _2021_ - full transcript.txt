It's bigger than I thought. It's a mess. I can't throw things away. I stick it all down here. I understand. Why sell it? Cellars are useful. We have another one. We're redoing our kitchen. It'll cover the cost. I had it inspected. No humidity, no mold. No dry rot? Dry rot eats away at the wood in no time. No, no dry rot either. We kept my kid's clothes here for years. They were fine. Then, straight to charity. I'll have to do the same with my mother's. She died two months ago. I must clear out her place. I'm sorry. In the end, mothers are weird. We're supposed to grieve, to be sad. If you're not sad, you wonder why. Because mothers are mothers, we can't say a thing. If you're not moved when they die, it'll be much worse later on. I have to go to a construction site. Will it do? It's exactly what I want. A wood door isn't too fragile? I strengthened the hinge, 3-point locking. We got robbed last year. They took a hundred bottles. I adore wine. One of my weaknesses. Can we negotiate? Because 10,000 for a cellar... You won't find that size cheaper. - Can't we say 8,000? - I can do 9,000. No less. You're an architect? Yes. Nice profession. Well, nice profession... Thank you. THE MAN IN THE BASEMENT He's a moving man, 225 pounds, carries furniture all day. I'm about to draw his blood and he panics. Tiny little needle! He was livid, about to faint! It's a thing. It's called "needle-phobia". I'd love to jab needles all day like Mom. Seriously, I'm into watching guys panic. I saw a nice guy for the cellar. He seems very calm. He needs storage space. We can meet him tomorrow. Honey, I spoke to the orthodontist, he cancelled for Wednesday. No, Mom! Now when is it? - In 3 weeks. - 3 weeks? He should have taken off my braces two months ago! I'm fed up! Justine! Mr. Fonzic. My wife, Hélène. Ahmad, 3 mint teas, please. I drew up a contract. Sign here. My lawyer will whip it into a sales agreement. Okay with it? I'll keep this one. You take the other. And you signed it. Fine. We said 9,000. I'll pay all at once. No deed first? This way it's taken care of. What kind of work do you do? I taught History at Chaville High School. I had to stop for health reasons. Pity, I love contact with students. Mr. Fonzic lost his mother two months ago. My condolences. Well, she was 87. At that age... It's always hard to lose a mother. What do you know? His mother's a bulldozer. Not since her hip replacement. In the meantime, she gardens, works for two charities, and we must go to Sunday lunch. Must? We don't have to! We all enjoy it. My mother rented a two-room apartment in Chaville. Now the landlord harasses me to clear out her stuff. There isn't much, 2 or 3 boxes, some furniture. Can I drop it off before signing the deed? Why not? We trust each other. Here. You should clear out your stuff first. I'll do it on Saturday. I'll leave the key with the caretaker. You're doing me a big favor. I was in an awful state. Is there a leak upstairs? That stain's been there for ages. - What's this? - From the cellar. Something rusty? An old wine rack. It'll be fine. Ever hear of tetanus? Tetanus, no, what's that? Oh yeah! I hear it's mega contagious. Watch out for tetanus! She'll say I'm pale and I don't eat enough. She always wants me to eat red meat. Here already? I'm running late, how awful! Hi, Mom. - All good? - I brought pie. Hi, Nelly! Smells good. You're good, honey? Justine, you're pale! - Do you eat enough? - I eat, Grandma. Do you eat meat? Red meat? Yes, I eat red meat. How's your hip? I tried your anti-inflammatory but I was allergic. I'll end up in a wheelchair. What are you doing? Careful. - You'll fall into your gratin. - Wait. Hey, family. How are you, Jérémie? And you? Your hair looks great. You good, David? - I brought this. Mom. - Hello, son. - You're dead! - We'll see! We'll see. That's right. Ready? I organized a dream vacation, Sinai to Jerusalem... 3 days at the Dead Sea, straight to Safed, the Ari Mikvah, and we finish in Eilat. 10 days, 1,200 euros with airfare. Can't beat it. So... computer crash. Hilton overbooked, 10 couples sleep in the bus. They're freezing. I fear the worst, having to reimburse them. Not at all. It was the best part of their trip! The one thing not planned. We're eating! You won't get me. Pass! Any news from Judith? 10 days late on alimony, she had my account blocked Now you won't be late. You put her through hell with what's-her-name. Constance? It lasted 3 months. It means he was unhappy at home. - Thanks, Mom. - You're late. - It'll be cold. - Sorry. I want to do krav maga. Like Jérémie. Do what? Krav maga. Israeli commando combat sport. - You enroll him in krav maga? - He did it. Girls can't do krav maga. I'll whip your ass at it. Where do you do your krav maga? Saint-Denis. - Outside Paris? - I'll go by metro, alone. It's far! - We didn't say yes. - It's a good idea. How are your projects? All well? Yes, very well. I'm restoring a hotel near the Champs-Élysées. 7 stories, basement, pool spa. But we're late. Invite us for a swim! It's concrete for now, so wait a bit. Your Pope is incredible. He accepts gay marriage now? "My Pope", you always say "my Pope". But it's good! It's great, if gays can get married in churches. - Yeah. - Sure. Jews should do the same. You stumped me. Jews don't... Us Jews can't... Are you kidding? 4,500... for the sale of the cellar. 4,500? Didn't we say 10,000? He talked me down to 9,000. I can keep it if you prefer. Idiot. Thanks, buddy. You're a lifesaver. I'm Jacques Fonzic. I bought Mr. Sandberg's cellar. - Hello, I'm Mai Phuong. - Hello, Mai Phuong. So Mr. Sandberg must have left a key for me? The van can't stay in the courtyard. I'll just be 20 minutes, time to drop off some crates. So, Mr. Célestin, feeling any better? I am, and thanks for asking. No one took care of the plants when I was sick. I watered them at least 3 times. I fought with the board to authorize them. - Give my regards to Mr. Martini. - I will. Krav maga isn't about strength. I thought: minimum weight, 500 pounds. 1,000-pound Sumos. Even dwarves would destroy their opponent in a sec. You strike vital centers. The guy dies! Thanks, I'd rather you not become a murderer. - Can I have a check? - No way. - A check please, Dad! - Don't even try. I want to do it. Sure, but first take down the garbage. What? You'll let her do krav maga? Girls must know self-defense. Imagine if someone tried raping me. I'd rip off his balls, smash his cock! Enough, enough! You're scaring me. Okay, girls. Take down the trash. - All good? - Yes, you? - The kid? - Good day! Have a good one. Mr. Sandberg. The man who bought the cellar slept in it last night. What? He slept in the cellar? He came up the service stairs to use the toilet here. I said they're locked, he went to the café. Okay. Thank you, Mai Phuong. There's a problem. No way! What problem? We sold storage space, not living space. Think I enjoy living down here? I'd found a studio to rent. As usual, people make promises they don't keep. People lie all the time. All they do is lie. I'm not referring to you. You were pretty amicable. You did me a favor. - Why not a hotel? - Too expensive. This building is full of sticklers for rules. Staying will cause a scandal. Who cares? I'm bothering no one. Not here! It's a question of decency, yours too! I bother no one. When's the studio for? Two weeks, maximum. I have a 6th-floor guestroom. You can sleep there two weeks. Today's the 20th? Leave the 5th. The 5th? I'll be gone before. Thank you. I'll talk to my wife and confirm. Thank you. Aren't you going overboard? Who is this guy? We don't know him. We owe him nothing. We can't leave him homeless. You never change, you feel you have to help everyone. Like that hitchhiker in Brittany, remember? You handed him 50 euros. A twenty year old, alone in the world. He harassed you for weeks, it drove you crazy. Let me see your hand. Poor thing, it's time to amputate. How's Jérémie? In love with you? Of course he is. Justine, you can't date your cousin! It's forbidden. - Bullshit. - It's true! If you have a child, it'll be abnormal. - Says who? - It's known, a blood thing. I'm not having kids with Jérémie. You crazy? With kids you never know. It's slam and bam. He'll be retarded, drooling all over you, it'll be gross. Can you hold this for a second? Thank you. Enjoying high school? Yeah. What subjects do you like? French, History too. History? I'm a History teacher. Where? I was in Chaville, but not anymore. - What era, now? - French Wars of Religion. Excellent. What's your religion? I'm Catholic, why? - Catholic? - I'm baptized but non-practicing. "Sandberg" isn't very Catholic. No. Sorry, I have a report. Sure. A report on what? The American frontier. You'll mention Indian extermination. What? Massacring of Indians by White colonists. There were almost 12 million deaths. No one mentions it. I didn't know. - Take care. - You too, and thanks. What's wrong? Problem? That guy you sold your cellar to, he's your friend? We made a deal, no more. He uses my restroom every day. I say nothing. I let him. He could thank me. The other day I said, "Maybe order a coffee." He started shouting, insulting me, he said "Dirty Arab!" Unbelievable. He's a racist, a true racist! Is this Diderot High School? I'd like to speak to the principal, Mr. Mazier. My name is Simon Sandberg. I called an hour ago, he said to call back now. Sure, I'll wait. Car keys? Mantle. - Where are you going? - Chaville. We sign at 11. Quick round trip. See you at the lawyer's. Principal Mazier? Simon Sandberg. I called concerning Jacques Fonzic. I had to ask you to come. Not stuff to be said over the phone. We had a problem with Mr. Fonzic. After you. Real Estate Law Hello, Mr. Fonzic. I'll tell Ms. Rivière. Coffee? Tea? Coffee, please. My husband's late. Hello, Hélène. They put me down the hallway. You may say I've reached retirement age, but I'm not ready to go. Hello, Mr. Fonzic. Coffee? Water? I spoke to Nelly. She gave me power of attorney. She told me her problems with City Hall, what a riot! So... Hurry! - Ms. Rivière? - Conference room. Is that the deed? You signed it? What's wrong? Simon, what's the problem? I spoke to Chaville City Hall. You lied to us, Fonzic. Your mother died 10 years ago, not 2 months. You owed 7 years of back rent. What's it to you? And your revoked teacher's license? The principal in Chaville told me everything. This man was fired for expounding political revisionism. What do you mean? He says he's free spirit. Did Napoléon really die in Saint Helena? Joan of Arc on a stake? I ask questions. Can we ask questions? If the gas chambers existed? The school board found out. He was reprimanded and did it again. He was terminated for being a Holocaust denier! You call the gas chambers "supposition". We're entitled to discuss. I don't discuss with your kind. Counselor, I cancel the sale. You're perfectly entitled to. Bravo, democracy. Stray from the consensus... Thrown outside like a dog! You signed a promise of sale! Look what I'll do with it. Give us the keys. The room on the 6th-floor. Here's the key. I planned to return it. Think I'm a freeloader? Now the insults. - Cellar keys too. - No, the cellar's mine. I bought it, you deposited the check. You were happy to take it. Here's your check back. Easy. 9,000 euros. Think you can cancel what you do? Snap a finger: Fonzic's cancelled! That's not how it works. Actions have consequences. Yes, consequences. What does Ms. Rivière think? You didn't sign the deed. Counselor, I know the law. I know it very well. An agreement on the object and the price closes the deal. Yes or no? Yes or no? You deposited the check? You gave me the key. Cellar's mine, I won't go. Give me the key back! Not at all, way too easy. One day black, next day white. And every man for himself. I suspected as much with your kind. "Your kind"? Explain. I don't mean you. I mean Mr. Sandberg! What does "your kind" mean? Tell me. You know. I don't know! Tell me! Beat it! Leave, Mr. Fonzic. Mr. Fonzic says fuck you! Get lost, enough of this crap! Careful! Hands off, I'll file a complaint! I'll go. I'm going home, if you care. And you can't do a thing. We'll sue. France has laws against his kind. We'll get an emergency injunction. - Your lawyer's name? - Massart, from the lab? Massart. I'll make an appointment. To think we sold him our cellar. We trusted him. It can happen to anyone. We'll push back hard. We'll squash that vermin. We'll crush him. I adore you! Indian massacres from 1750 to 1890 12 million Indians killed Can you come? We'd like to talk. - What, now? - Yes, now. Have a seat. Did you ever meet Mr. Fonzic? The guy who bought the cellar? Did you ever speak? A few words. Don't ever speak to him again. What did he do? Rape little girls? This is no laughing matter, Justine. He's a revisionist. A revisionist? What the fuck? Someone who denies the Holocaust. Come on, Dad, I know what a revisionist is. The guy down there? Unbelievable. We can't believe it either. - Who are they? What do they want? - Anti-Semites. They say Jews play victim, that the Holocaust is a big lie. What about the proof? The film footage? They say the footage is fake, that the witnesses are liars. He's a motherfucker! Don't talk like that! - Isn't he? - Don't talk to him. I'm not a baby. And I'm not scared. Promise us you won't. You're such pains! Okay, I promise. You'll go back into the cellars. Cellar beast. We know the liars. This is my home. I am the owner. The cellar is mine. I suffer from the lie. You are the executioner. You act like victims. I suffer. You are moralizers. You play victim. You must leave, not me. I live here. You won't make me leave. Mr. Sandberg! The man... he went back to the basement. He broke the lock and used the toilet. I'm warning you, this is last time I clean up! No one said to clean up. I'm seeing a lawyer. Trust me, we'll kick him out! Good day. Your mother owns the apartment. Got power of attorney? For my mother and my brother. Joint inheritance. We can cancel the sale on that alone. Know the Banca Aquila? A Spanish bank catering to far-right groups. In Spain, Belgium, Holland. The check Fonzic gave you was drawn from Banca Aquila. No way! He's in a neo-fascist forum based in Barcelona. He writes so-called "scientific" reports on the lack of hydrocyanic acid in Treblinka gas chambers. Or he measures the surface area of a gas chamber and he counts the victims based on the area to show that the 6 million were only 80 thousand. It's all online. He feeds the theories of historians who are lauded in Iran and give packed lectures. He spread his poison at that high school. He was fired in 2016 and got immediate support: phony historians, anti-Semites, conspiracy theorists, the usual online crazies. And since he was fired, he's become their martyr. Can this help us? Of course. I requested an emergency injunction to cancel the sale. - Will it take long? - No. 10 days, two weeks. Rest assured. We can even send him to prison. As long as he leaves the cellar. Why are you here? Your husband got carried away. Can we talk? No, I won't speak to you. I'm sorry. We all lost our tempers. I don't want bad blood between us. We're neighbors. We're not. My husband's cancelling the sale. What did I do? Tell me. Did I harm you? What are you doing? Get out of here. Get out or I'll call the police! The police now? You're wrong, you're wrong about everything. Your turn, miss. Thanks for coming. I got your message last night. It's a bad time. I'm self-employed. This way. There. Definitely a problem. I redid the plumbing. Give me your insurance info. They'll deal with it. They're crooks, they pay for the paint. For the rest, you're fucked. Water damage is normal. What's not normal is the guy in the basement. You let him move in? We sold him a cellar for storage, not for living. He said you kicked him out from the 6th floor. Nonsense. That's a total lie. I lent him a room up there. He refused to leave. I don't know who's wrong or right. Don't care. But he has to leave, for sure. Jose, don't let up. - Sure thing. - See you Thursday. Simon! Steiner! - Lukas Steiner! - No way. How are you? Simon Sandberg, an old college buddy. Sigried Anderssen, my assistant. Why are you here? I came for my suits. Bespoke. Monsieur buys bespoke suits! Yes, my friend. Where do you live now? Amsterdam, Brussels? London. Corporate law in the City. You, a corporate lawyer? No way. Simon and I were joined at the hip. We lived together, demonstrated together. - Hit on girls together. - I tried. He stole them all. - I tried calling in vain. - We'll meet up. And Hélène? Is she well? You managed to keep her? As long as you keep a distance. I'm running late. Call me! I'd love to. Hello, Counselor. The emergency injunction was rejected? You said we could. How long will it take? Lukas Steiner. Of course! He wanted to defend widows and orphans. His hero was Badinter and now he does corporate? He must make a fortune. He used to hit on me like crazy. You'd never say a word. You'd let him. I couldn't hold it against him. He's a seduction machine. He was with a blonde bombshell he introduced as his assistant. He could have helped evict Fonzic. Massart didn't call? He was supposed to. I thought I'd say hi to my kid brother. Great. - Glass of Chablis? I just opened it. - Why not? Hello, Hélène. I'll get you a glass. Work's good? Construction, permits... And Justine? She's great. Doing homework. So all's good. This Chablis is delicious. Really excellent. And the guy in the cellar? How's he? Who told you? Justine. She told Jérémie, who told me. Because we talk. It's true? You sold the cellar to a Holocaust denier. It's not a joke? Because, it's fucking hilarious. Totally crazy, but true. My lawyer's contesting the sale. Okay, and you said nothing. You kept it to yourself. I wanted to settle it first. Don't think it concerns me? And Mom? - We co-own this apartment. - I know. This is you to a T. You say nothing, ask for no help. Aren't we a family? We're fucking brothers! I should have told you. And your blind trust! Giving the keys before closing? You're reckless! - Think everyone likes Jews? - Okay... Okay? It's not okay! It's not okay! When is the trial? Emergency hearing in 3 weeks. Listen, I spoke to Massart. It was rejected. We must follow normal proceedings. - When did you find out? - 2 hours ago. You didn't tell me? I was going to. He called on my way home. How long will it last? At best, 6 months. Worst, a year. A year with him down there? I'm going. Will you walk me down? That him? The cellar guy? Yes. It's you who says gas chambers never existed. I'm talking to you! Why did my great-uncle never come back? Auschwitz, Treblinka? Dachau? How do you explain it? I should beat him up. Get lost. It's simple. France punishes Holocaust denial. It's forbidden. - He should be behind bars. - Mom... We can't sue over ideas. We need to find a way to nullify the sale. How can we? Start by changing lawyers. I met Massart, he's full of shit. Why is that? See the suntan and the 3-piece suit? He's a total show-off. He's publicity-hungry, I hate his type! He's been on the case for a month. I can't switch because of his tan. We're in enough trouble, I'll choose the lawyer. I won't fire him to please you! Your brother has good ideas. - Got someone in mind? - I sure do. Carole Vasquez. The desecrated Jewish cemetery in Alsace was her. She won against the neo-Nazis who beat up the mechanic. It mustn't become a fight about anti-Semitism. What is it then? He's right! Fonzic is a true-blue Jew-hater. It's not the point. We have to attack his ownership claim. Do you trust Carole Vasquez? She's a Rottweiler. No letting up. Yeah, right. Sleep with her by any chance? Know what? You're so pathetic, I won't answer you. All right, David... can you call her? Just waiting for you to ask. Go on, call. Sure, I will. You can't always decide how things turn out. Like before Dad died. What? I planned a big family trip to Haifa. Simon backed out at the last minute. There's no link! I told you, I couldn't leave the construction site. So we never went and Dad died. I'm to blame for his death? That's enough, you two! Show some dignity. Think about your father. What he passed onto you. We should have sold the apartment. It's full of unhealthy memories. He'd never have wanted us to sell. And those unhealthy memories... are the story of our family. I thought you quit. So did I. Pictures, letters... Stuff going back three generations. This is Simon's grandfather. With his brother Samuel. He got deported, right? Samuel was arrested in April '42, with his wife. They were interned a month in Drancy then sent to Auschwitz She went straight to the gas chamber. He died a year later. It's nice talking to you. I missed out on having a girl! Look, this is from their last Hanukah. - The fireplace looks like ours. - Of course. It's where Samuel used to live. In your apartment. Mrs. Sandberg. I was about to send you a certified letter about Mr. Fonzic. He scares us. You must do something. Why is he in your cellar? You invited him. What'll you do? My husband's taking legal action. That will take months. Meanwhile we bear his presence... I have to run. Unbelievable! Mr. Sandberg. Hello, Counselor. - David's not here? - He's on his way. There's no use trying to evict Fonzic. You gave him the keys. It's his home now. - That's all there is to it? - Yes. In France, the right to housing is a human right. Which is great. Imagine evicting people for being far right! Or far left. Even Landru deserves lodging. So what do we do? Revisionism in France is 30 guys fantasizing off on their own. But with internet, their poison gets spread all over. With the last survivors are dying, it'll be their word against the revisionists'. This is the age of doubt. Rumors are taken at face value. It's disgraceful, but too bad. I get 50 emails from him a day. 50 a day? Excellent, that's harassment. What do his emails say? They're a mix of insults, claims... It's his cellar! It's his home! It won't be home for long. Save all the emails and send them to me. Above all, don't show you're rattled. It's what he wants. To smell your fear. I know it's hard, but hold up. Sorry. There was a lot of traffic. I was telling your brother to be patient. We'll plead our case in six months. But you won't be sitting idly by. File a lawsuit with the other owners. Fonzic's presence is a co-ownership issue. Call for an emergency co-op meeting. With a majority, you can undertake eviction proceedings. And I'll try to have the court date moved up. As usual, you're never on time. Okay, whatever. Vasquez is good, right? Isn't she? Yes, she's good. It's what matters. Grab a coffee? Sorry, I'm in a rush. You're always in a rush. - You got a burger? - Yeah, why? 50% of meat-eaters in France die of cancer. 50 percent? That's 30 million people. Meat is totally toxic! - Says who? - The internet. - So now you're vegetarian? - Yes, fortunately. What about your nuggets? Nuggets are different because they're white meat, not red. Since I eat no meat and no vegetables, this is all I have left. My mother tries. She makes me try carrots, broccoli, zucchini. I can't get it down. Beets must be the worst. See that guy there? He's our cave dweller. Seriously seedy. Want to play a trick? - Why not you? - He knows me! Walk past him and knock over his tray by accident. It'll work. Go on, I'll watch. Be careful! It wasn't on purpose! - I'm soaking! - No biggie. "No biggie"... I don't believe it! Why did you do that? I didn't do anything. You asked her to spill her tray on me. Why? I found it funny. Heard things about me? Don't believe what you hear, my child. I'm not your child. I know you're a revisionist. You know what a revisionist is? Sure I do. Scum who says Auschwitz was fake. Nonsense. Of course Auschwitz existed. As for what happened there, I question the official truth. I'm a researcher. I don't have every answer, but I search the truth. Researcher, my ass. You're not searching. Our uncle got gassed in Auschwitz. There are witnesses, there's proof. You know witnesses aren't reliable. Ever see a car accident? Why do some witnesses see a red light, and others green? They all witnessed the same thing. After his arrest, the apartment was seized. "The Aryanization of Jewish property". Imagine! The Aryanization. One month later, Mr. and Mrs. Jacques Briançon bought it. Transactions made during the Occupation were voided. Rightful owners got their property back. My grandfather. Look. Deed of Sale, 1942. The Prefecture's stamp. Can't get more official. Where's the new deed? Mom has it. You never said this was your uncle's place. Mom tells everyone. You never mentioned it. So? - You don't care what happened here? - Sure I do. I've heard the story all my life. I don't want to get hung up on the past, like my brother. I don't know... I want to move forward. Understand? You never hurt me. When was your last bloodwork? Six months ago. Excellent. You're in remission? Yes, well... Too soon for a victory dance. - Any news from your mom? - She called. She says it's too hot. She knew what Miami would be like. Want to grab a couscous? Inviting me to lunch? - Want a merguez? - No, thanks. I'll take it. Deep down, this cancer did me good. It's true. I'd lost the taste for life, your mother had left. If it weren't for Dr. Cohen, I wouldn't be here. You owe it to yourself, Dad. You fought hard. Still... Jewish doctors are great. - Dad! - What? What did I say? I just said Dr. Cohen is great. No, you said "Jewish doctors"', not "Dr. Cohen", So what? Lots of doctors are Jewish and everyone knows it. Oncologists, neurologists, cardiologists... Thanks, I get it. That's politically correct. We can't speak because... Because what? Because... Too bad if you see evil everywhere. He popped out in the courtyard and scared me. That's why I need your permission to call a meeting. Mr. Sandberg wants a co-op meeting about that man. The man in the basement. He doesn't seem mean. He helped me carry my bottles of water. Can we say November 22 at 6pm? The 22nd... - Isn't Delphine coming then? - Yes! Delphine's our oldest granddaughter. To my dear children... They all want something done, and then they disappear. Fonzic watered the flowers, now Martini adores him. If your Nazi neighbor prunes his roses, he's wonderful. I have two more people to see. I can go, if you want. Let me participate. It's normal that I deal with this. Normal? Because it's your place? I didn't say that. It's just that... That what? Look, a letter from your grandfather. You know your uncle was denounced? No. Maybe the Briançons did it for the apartment. Denunciation, France's national sport. Before being deported, he spent a month in a cellar. The one Fonzic is in. What are you doing? You don't use this toilet? Yes, I have one in my lodge now. Well, neither will Mr. Fonzic. Pivot on your foot. Move, move, no downtime. Jérémie, put these on... Wait! Let him put on the pads first. Right, left, right, and so on. 1, 2, 3... Go on... Hit! - I can't anymore. - Are you? That was great. - Was it? - Yeah, it was excellent. I'm exhausted too. - You took a while. - I shampooed. - You smell like orange. - Grapefruit. Wanna get a Coke? I don't have any time. I'm off. See you later. Bye. What is it? Something wrong? Did I talk to you? No, I didn't ask a thing. Why are you here? Beat it! I can buy tomatoes. If you're sad, don't take it out on me. I don't give a fuck! Get lost, you reek! I reek because I live in a cellar and have nowhere else? I'd like to be warm in a nice place. Your father's evicting me. He's suing me. Know what? I'm not even angry. I just want people to stop railing on me. I'm just trying to understand. Is searching for truth a crime? - Just trying to understand! - It's true! Check about the American Indians? They go on and on about the Shoah, but 12 million Indians were massacred. No one mentions it. It's a taboo. And I'm the crazy one? All that matters, Justine, is to learn to be a free thinker. Question "official versions". You done? Can you stop now? Beat it! - Forget your keys? - I can't find them. - You had them this morning? - Of course I did! Check your room. Don't be a pain, I said they're not there. - Where were you before? - School. - After school! - At krav maga. Maybe they're in the locker room. You've totally lost it. Get me their number. No, there's no one there! Give me the number! You're crazy! We can't go now! What's wrong? Justine lost her keys. I'll get a locksmith. It can wait. No, I won't stay here if a stranger can come in! Whoever comes across the keys won't find the apartment. - Is there your name and address? - No! What are you doing? Stop! Let go of me! Get lost! What does he do all day in the basement? It's simple. He goes online... emails his so-called truths to the entire planet, and goes to bed in the cellar. You don't mind? Of course I mind. But I won't let him obsess me. He's alone with his hate. We're together and we love each other. Go to sleep. Mr. Leroux! Sorry I'm early. The insurance company said to need to sign the form. I forgot to. I can get a signature? I can't now, I'm in a rush. To get rid the guy in the basement, want a signature? That's a different matter. I don't mind him. Why does everyone hate him? The co-owners will decide. That's why I want a meeting. A meeting. More talk. I saw him go up to the 6th floor. To use the toilet there. I didn't know. Right... You don't know much. Why are you here? For a blood test. I have a prescription. I fainted the other day. Maybe it's... hypoglycemia. You want me to pity you? I'm not a whiner. Even with everything you do to me. I won't draw your blood. Leave here. Why? My blood's no good? It's like yours. If you prick us, we bleed. I asked you to leave. You have no right to refuse. Karine... can you tend to this gentleman? I'm sorry, I have no time. Want me to draw blood? Sure. Follow me. Roll up your sleeve. I'll hurt you. "By accident". So? Something wrong? What is it, hon? Go away. Leave me alone. Tell me what's wrong. It's the dentist! My braces should have come off in September, then September became October and now it's December! December is soon. Fuck it. If he doesn't take them off, I will. With a wire-cutter. A wire-cutter? Great idea. He'll do it, and you'll have a dazzling smile. - Meanwhile, I'm a monster. - Stop! You're beautiful. Totally, amazingly gorgeous. Whatever. - You say that because you're my dad. - Yes, I am. And I love you. THE JEWISH THREAT JEWS! What's all this? Where's it from? Can you answer? Where did you get it all? Online, like everyone. One-click shopping. You bought revisionist books online? I need to know what goes on in their heads. And this crap will help you understand? Look, one of Fonzic's articles. Straight from his blog. He attacks a survivor of Bergen-Belsen. He refutes her testimony. She says she arrived there on April 18, 1943. He claims there were no trains that day. So he says she lied, then methodically refutes her testimony. You went on Fonzic's blog? Why? I need to understand... unlike you. I need a Holocaust-denier in my cellar to understand myself? Why not? You always avoided your origins. He's giving you a chance. - He makes you confront your past. - Don't lecture! Listen to this. "The alleged extermination of the Jews" - alleged! - "in Treblinka has been easily debunked." Stop! "Quote-unquote 'witnesses' say they were thrown into boiling water. "Others 'witnesses' say they were burned at the stake. "We don't know what to choose "between the lies and propaganda of the fake war and those of the fake witnesses." Can you imagine? Give that to me! Simon, please! Open up! Open up, Fonzic! I know you're in there! Open! Open up! I'm leaving. You okay? You okay, Mom? Teacher fired for Holocaust denial Must we believe the "witnesses"? The number of complaints nowadays! Last week 3 guys attacked a boy. He wore a yarmulke. This man moved into your basement? We're trying to cancel the sale, but it's not easy. We'll summon him and file a complaint with the Prosecutor's. What if he doesn't come? We'll pay him a visit in his cellar. You don't have any trouble with your neighbors? Sure it's him? Yes, who else? It's like he signed it. Anyone in the building could have done it. We'll go take a picture. That'll be hard... I removed it. Why did you do that? So my wife and daughter wouldn't see. When you file a complaint, you don't remove the evidence. Line up! Face me, in order of belt color. A nice line. Jérémie, hurry up! Move over for him. Okay, everyone. Start with light sparring. Gloves, mouth-guards, and pick a partner. You okay? Let me see. - It was an accident. - I know. - The nose isn't broken. - Let's see. You're fine. I'll take you home. - Sure? - Leave me the hell alone! Mom? Call me. The code's broken, I'm locked out. Call me back! Problem? I'm locked out. The code doesn't work. They changed the code. You dad didn't tell you? Me neither. Someone else was nice enough to give it to me. - What is it? - Your father could have told you. No one tells me anything. What happened? - Nothing. - Got punched? - No, it's nothing. - Wait. I have a healing ointment that works wonders. You'll see it heals twice as fast. How do you know that? I got beat up by 4 guys a year ago, I couldn't walk for a month. Serves you right for being a hate-monger. What's the code? You know, I fight for my ideas. But when people don't agree, they destroy you. They just want the official version. I say we must reach our own conclusions. - That's being free. - Free? You're not free. You live like a rat in a hole! Why do you say that? I'm freer in my basement than most people. Yeah, right. - Want to see? - You crazy? - Are you afraid? - No, I'm not afraid. Come and see. Come! Côte-Rôtie. The wine merchant said it's wondrous. Speaking of wonders, the prettiest of all. Give Grandpa a kiss. What's this? Gorgeous! That blue and purple go well together. Give me your makeup artist's name! He forgot to do the other one. - What happened? - Nothing. Didn't break your nose? You're too old for schoolyard fights! It was during training, I took a blow. - Training for? - Krav maga. What's that? She's not doing judo? Judo's tacky. Tacky? Wait, look. Don't let it spoil your appetite. Chocolate éclairs, lemon tarts. Sorry, I thought it was tomorrow. We didn't wait. You're overworked, but otherwise? I'm fine. - What happened? - Nothing. It's no big deal, unimportant. My father brought wine. Côte-Rôtie, tell me what you think. Excellent. Children, I want us to toast to my status of "official survivor". My last blood tests came back great. Congrats. "Survivor" is saying a lot. I wasn't clowning around 6 months ago. You're in remission. Not a survivor. Remission, survivor, same thing. I'm cured. That's what matters. Grandpa's taking me to Miami this summer. If you're not blind by then. One eye is cool. - Simon, no! - I have to answer. Problems with the co-op board. Don't I know it! Same in my building. A big Senegalese clan moved in. What a racket, music till 2 am. You can't imagine. The kids block the elevator. It's pure hell. But there's no evicting them! Why so rude with your dad? Be nicer. You come late, make calls and I'm not nice? I got one phone call. We see your mom once a week and you blow off my dad. But I'm not aggressive with him. I'm aggressive? He comes to celebrate his remission and you jump down his throat. - Hear what he said? - No, what? - That he's a survivor. - What's the problem? Survivors are for camps. What? There are lots of kinds of survivors. Survivors are from concentration camps. Nonsense! Want to check? Come and check. I'll get my phone. No need. Simon, no need to check! So... - Stop! - Wait. "Survivor... "Refers to a person surviving an accident, a loss, a disaster. "Crash survivors. Synonym: unharmed, "safe, saved, surviving. Shipwreck survivors. "A person who continues living, perseveres." Where are the camps? But you're not shocked by what my father says? He's right-wing, but it's no big deal. You take it personally, like you're complicit. Don't you see how he talks, how he comes off? He could have collaborated in '40! Do you hear yourself? You're... - What are you making him pay for? - Nothing, stop it! In the meantime, Fonzic's still here! I'm on it day and night! I saw two lawyers, I'm trying my hardest! It beats going haywire nonstop! Know what? If you really want to take charge, go downstairs and beat him to a pulp! We're in France and there are laws! We'll beat Fonzic with the law, like it or not. You hide behind the law! You're to blame for giving him the keys! It's your fault he's here! - It's your fault, Simon! - Calm down! What are you doing? You're fighting. You're totally crazy! Fonzic is a manipulator. He's playing with you. At first, he sends you emails. Then vandalizes your door. You wipe it clean and the police can't do a thing. So what does he do? He starts over. Tightens his grip. No matter what, you mustn't play into his logic. We'll talk to the press. I strongly advise against it. These people get off on that. Claiming they're gagged, acting like they're the victims. Simon, I see you're at the end of your rope. Why not move for two months? He's the one who should move! Rent a place to calm things down. You're on edge and he uses that. I'm just trying to protect you. These guys can blow a fuse, but if you move... This is unbelievable! You want us to move because we're in the way? I didn't say that. You're defending us! This is pathetic! How infuriating! That's just surrendering! - David... - Don't "David" me! I lost my temper. I shouldn't have. You can't help it. As always. I know. I'm an ass. Now we have no lawyer. What do we do? What do you suggest? Hello. Your healing ointment. Thanks. Show me your eye. It looks better. I told you this ointment was great. I wanted... I wanted to ask... How do you manage in the cellar? For washing... Public showers. I'm very careful about hygiene. If you knew how filthy people are... My wife loved bubble baths, she'd soak for hours. You were married? To a beautiful woman too. We lived in Belgium, near Ghent. My wife was like me. She was allergic to preconceived ideas. She was a free spirit. Then she died. A car accident. I don't know if you're lying or being truthful. I always tell the truth. That's what irks people. The truths they don't want to hear. Disappear! Sweep the dust under the rug. But the dust remains. People breathe it in without realizing. There are no rugs in a cellar, so no dust. - But there are rats. - Rats... At least rats stick together, they're united. Not like human beings. People were supposed to help me find a place. Yeah, right! Never got betrayed by people who love you? None of your business. He uses our water, our electricity, it's not right! The other night, I saw him butt-naked defecating in the basement. Trust me, it's nauseating. This can't continue. It's unbearable! He has to relieve himself somewhere. Mr. Sandberg sealed off the toilet. Hygiene is necessary. How does he manage? Public showers. Rue de Meaux. I often see him walking by my shop. Not to fan the flames, but it's your fault he's here. That's why I requested this emergency meeting. Unfortunately, this concerns us all. By taking joint action, we can remove Fonzic. A group complaint will get him evicted. We'd need a lawyer. Who would pay? Legal fees cost a fortune. Don't worry, I'll pay. It's only normal. As long as we all agree. It's too easy to ask us to rectify your mistake. You're to blame for his presence here. It could have happened to anyone. He's not a poor homeless guy. He's no bum. He's a racist, an anti-Semite, spreading hate online. So what? Don't lump us all together. You can't say that. Anti-Semitism concerns everyone, not just Jews. We can't tolerate these things. Look at his texts, they're enlightening! He says you rented him your 6th-floor room and evicted him for no reason. He told me that too. That explains it! I never rented him that room! I lent it before realizing he was an anti-Semite. Mr. Sandberg, two days ago I received this deed, which came as a surprise. It seems you're not the owner of your apartment. What's this? That shows that your apartment belonged to Mr. Jacques Briançon. Your grandfather evicted the legal owner before moving in. It's the opposite. I received the same document. Me too. Yes, I think we all received it. By magic, you all received it without wondering why. It seems perfectly authentic. Of course it is. It dates from 1942. Still something's fishy. You must admit it's suspicious. Fonzic sent them! It's a scheme, that's all! Where is your deed? Can you show it to us? I don't have to prove I own my apartment! Do you have your deed, Leroux? That's not a problem. I can show it to you. My family's lived here for 3 generations. My great-uncle, my grandfather and my father! I was born here. I came after my father died. That's not enough? There's no use yelling. You know what we'll do? Bring your deed to our next meeting... There is no next meeting! We'll solve this here and now! Hélène... you all right? How much you want? How much? Let's make a deal. I'll pay you twice the price and you leave. And go where? Rent a room, a studio, whatever. A studio will last a year. The cellar's my home, I own it. You don't own it! You'll lose in court and have to leave. The only thing I own is that cellar and you want to steal it. You seal off the toilet, you treat me like an animal. And then you lecture me? You put racist graffiti on my door! What do you mean? Maybe people here don't like Jews. Ask Mr. Leroux! Harassed for a supposed leak! You get off living in a Jew's cellar, don't you? Is that it? No, that's terrible. You contained yourself? Did you hit him? Go on, hit me if you'll feel better! Only the guilty resort to violence. You call this a democracy, what nonsense! Once we refuse your preconceived ideas, we're hunted down, like dogs! Bastard! Good thing you didn't hit. As long as you respect the law, you win. Don't strike back. - Easy to say. - I know. Binchotan-seared filet mignon with Korean pears. Roasted sea bass with baby carrot confit. Enjoy. You mind? I'm starving. Amazing meat. So will you take on my case? Of course I will. How could I refuse? Nice change from financial scandals. I know exactly how to proceed. We focus on the guy living in the basement. Know what we'll do? We'll argue the misuse of the place and its function. Meaning? For example, you can't sell clothes in office space. Or start a restaurant in an apartment. It's the same thing. Fonzic works, sleeps, eats in the basement. Takes water from the building. He shits in the entrance. - I sealed off the toilet. - Excellent! It's not in the ownership regulations. This is important, Simon. Each time he does something, you take note. Graffiti, insults, threats. And not fight back? Stay cool, let him dig himself deeper, and we win. I'm here. Your friend Lukas is here. Simon thinks he can settle everything with a big smile. It's not that easy. He does his best. And nothing's happening. He doesn't accept his roots. That's his problem. He's brave, he's loyal. Loyalty isn't enough. To finish warming up, one stick, one knife for 2. We start in 5. Hurry, hurry! Here we go! Focus! Shoulder, hip... - You good? - Hey, Amos. Glad you came for the belt test. Justine will be happy. Your brother told me about your cellar. I can take care of it. Great! - You blab to everyone. - Listen to him. This goes beyond you personally. It concerns all of us, the whole community. What are you suggesting? I don't understand. Relax, we're helping. I don't want to relax! So what do you suggest? We go see him with two of my guys, and we talk. Talk? With iron rods? We'll just scare him. - No more. - Great. It's time to stop this. You know, Simon, Jews silently accepting persecution, those times are over. We fight now. I'm not "the Jews", not "the community". I'm Simon Sandberg. - I do as I please. - So why not act? I'm taking action! Fonzic is still there! Our offer is concrete. Let us deal with this. Set foot there and you'll fight me. You fight your brother and defend him? Time to choose sides. You self-hating Jew! What the fuck? Calm down! Butt out! Dad! You okay? You okay? Get lost! You're crazy, you all are! Let go of me! Get in the car! - You're crazy! - Get in! Leave me alone! I'm walking! Come back! Go away! Lukas! I can't stand it. What? I told you I'm busy. Everything's falling apart! Help me! Simon, calm down. The hearing is on January 10th. One more month, you have to hold up. I can't! Not a month. The health department will inspect the basement. I asked for a full report, with samples. Samples of what? Fonzic's shit. Pick up his excrement. The judge will react when I drop it on his desk. Your Honor, observe Jacques Fonzic's feces, left daily in the basement. In the ownership regulations, nothing allows owners to defecate in the basement. Imagine? Be brave, my friend. Don't cave in. We've got your Fonzic. Vandalism? You left it? Of course I left it. You live in rue Marx Dormoy? Is your husband Simon Sandberg? He came a month ago for a tag. An anti-Semitic slogan. A tag? I live here, I'm your daughter's mother and you said nothing! He could have hurt her! - Think about that? - He's out to hurt me. He researched the building, my family. Please... Don't go. I need you. You don't. You need no one. You do everything on your own. You protect yourself, not us. Take Justine to my father's? If you want that. I do. She won't spend another night here. Pick her up and take her to my dad's. - Why are you here? - To pick you up. To take you to Grandpa's. What the hell? Your mother left the house. You're going to Grandpa's. You're separating? It's temporary... We need... for things to calm down. I packed you a sweater, a T-shirt. Underwear too? You took my computer. Why are you smiling? You panicked so much over that guy in the cellar. He does nothing bad. He's alone. He just asks question and everyone attacks him. Know what kind of questions? Unsettling questions. Questions that are forbidden, so people stay docile. Questions that challenge official truths. You spoke to him. Didn't you? Tell me the truth. Yes or no? Yes. I spoke to Fonzic and I'm not dead. What did I say? I forbade you! You can't. I'm not a baby! He's dangerous! Not at all! He's alone in a basement. You're the scaredy-cats! I pity you and Mom, you can't even stay together! Your fear is pathetic! What scares you? The truth. Don't budge! Lay off my daughter! Don't speak to her! Open! I'll never leave! I live here! You don't get it? I own this place! You won't leave? You won't leave. You'll see. You won't leave. You won't leave? You'll see. What are you doing? You'll burn down the building! We're done with him! I'll kill you! There are thousands of us living in basements. We have nothing to lose. We're rats, but we fight! And you don't fight? You reap profits, even from your dead! Filthy kike! Dirty Jew! Go on, strike me! No balls! Little Sandberg... So sensitive, with his little family! Little uncle gassed. Shut up! Think your wife left because of me? Think your kid scorns you because of me? Didn't even hurt! You can't even strike, you wimp! Little Jew wimp! I'll kill you! Dirty Jew! Dirty Jew! We didn't gas you all. Our mistake, but we'll make up for it. We'll be back! One day in custody, consider yourself lucky. You should get preventive detention. You owe me one, but you'll be judged. You, not him. Because Fonzic lodged a complaint. He's suing you. Property damage and assault. We had him, he was ours. I'd have chased him to hell, I'd have slain him! You fucked it all up. We can't even plead now. My client sets a fire! What do I look like? Fonzic disappeared. Disappeared? How so? Disappeared. But you're not out of the woods. Nothing is settled. Fonzic is still the owner. He can come back whenever he wants. Understand? David? My brother. Sorry. Sorry, Dad. THE MAN IN THE BASEMENT
