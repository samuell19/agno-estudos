[SIREN] -Call the ambulance. [WHEEZING] -My god, this man's still alive. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Welcome home, sir. -Thank you. Here we are, my dear. Mason, this is Miss Wheatley. -Ma'am. -Miss Wheatley's room is prepared? -Yes, sir. -Splendid. Be a good fellow and take her bags up, will you? And Master Clive and Miss Christina, they're here? -In the library, sir. -And Master Giles, too? Yes, sir. -Fine, fine. Now I can assure you, my dear, there's absolutely nothing to be nervous about. They'll take to you. Of that I'm convinced. -What a pity all our new family couldn't be here. -Yes, I had to leave Elizabeth behind in Switzerland. She's bitterly sorry to miss the wedding, but her absence is unavoidable. -Oh, I'm glad he's marrying again. I'd been suggesting it for years. -Oh, come now. You make yourself sound like an old crone. -So he's finally decided to take the plunge. -Oh, here they are. -Clive. Clive, my boy. Welcome. Anna, my darling. This is my son, Clive. -How do you do? -Hello. I'm delighted to meet you. -And my daughter, Christina. -You'll have to nag him. He never wraps up warm in winter. -Are you trying to tell me I'm an old man? And this is my adopted son, Giles. -Hello. Always the last card in the pack. -Some might say the joker. How about a drink? Do sit down, everybody. Don't stand on ceremony. Miss Wheatley's bags are in her room, sir. And I thought some refreshment after your journey-- -Good man. It's all right, I'll see to the drinks. -Very well, Sir Hugo. -Mason, I hear your sister is unwell. Quite poorly, sir. -If there's anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to ask. -Thank you, sir. -Now. Everyone having their usual? -Clive. -Champagne. -Oh. Anna, darling? -Yes, of course. Now, I have a little surprise for you. -Father? -Anna and I have decided to get married at once. -When, exactly? -This Saturday. -Oh. You have discovered that my father is a resolute man. When he sets his heart on something, nothing will stop him. -May you both be very happy. -Here, here. -Anna. -Anna. -They've taken you to their heart. I was naturally very anxious to make a very good impression. -And what impression did my progeny make on you? -Christina is delightful. -And already spoken for, I suspect. She and Giles-- -They seem devoted to one another. -They'd have me believe they're mere acquaintances. And what did you make of Clive? -He has your sense of humor. -He himself will be marrying shortly. -I'm surprised you didn't suggest a double wedding. -We'd steal his thunder, and he knows it. -I feel relaxed now. I hope your children feel the same. -My children are full-grown. They'll all be going their own separate ways before very long. -Then I will give you children, Hugo. -Nothing would delight me more. Dearest Anna. [CHIME] The time. -You'll be late. And you said the meeting can't start without you. -I'll not be away for more than a few hours. -Psychical research. How long have you been involved in it? -Oh, some years now. -And your photography? -Uh-- early days. -Are you as reticent with Christina about your work as you are with me? -It is not something that would interest you particularly. -Everything you do interests me. What exactly do you photograph? -You wouldn't believe me were I to tell you. -Try me. -I think not. -Darling, is something wrong? -Nothing. -I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked. -Very well. In all fairness, I ought to tell you. You will think it preposterous, if not positively macabre. -I can think nothing unless you explain. -My colleagues and I-- -Sir Edward, whom I've met. -Photograph the dead. I see. -You disapprove? -Well, I don't know. Why photograph-- -Cadavers? What can you learn by-- -Someday I'll tell you. -A morbid preoccupation with-- -The dead? -What good can it do? -Am I tempting some kind of providence? -Possibly. -No. A smudge here. And another one here. And finally another, here. At first I was tempted to explain away the smudges I've shown you by bad exposure. -But Sir Hugo, three different pictures, taken on three different pieces of equipment, by-- -Three different photographers. -It is perplexing, to say the least. -All three slides, apart from the smudge you've seen, have one thing in common. Your president will explain. Sir Edward. -Each of the subjects in the slides Sir Hugo has shown you was about to die. I myself took the first slide at the moment the subject died. And Sir Hugo took the second slide-- -And also recorded a man in the process of dying. -The third photographer has testified that he, too, waited until the moment of death before recording the subject. -And each slide is characterized by that smudge. Your president has suggested what that smudge might be. -I examined the slide I made and the equipment I used most carefully, lest the smudge was due to a faulty recording. -I, too, needed to assure myself that nothing could happen to prevent an accurate recording. Your president and I then worked closely with the third photographer, examining the equipment he used, questioning him about everything he did. -Circumstances were perfect. Nothing technical could have gone wrong. -The three of us were therefore obliged to conclude one thing, and one thing only. I myself prepared the plates and designed and developed the impediment used in the recordings, and I am satisfied it was used properly. Gentlemen, what you have seen, what we have recorded, is the soul at the moment it departs the body. At death. -You don't really believe that, Father. You can't photograph the soul, given it exists. -What were those smudges? Thumb prints, I suppose? -Probably. -I've always taught you to keep an open mind, but I little did I know you'd turn out to be such a skeptic. -I'm cautious, that's all. Wary about claims made by researches into so-called psychic phenomena. -When do you return to Switzerland? -Elizabeth is expecting me in a fortnight's time. -You've chosen wisely. She'll make you a fine wife. -And you and Anna. You're ideally suited. -Good evening, sir. -Oh, Mason, about your sister. I don't want you worrying about money, so refer the doctor to me. -That's very kind of you, sir. Thank you again. -Tell Miss Wheatley I'm home. -Very well, sir. -Father, you're generous to a fault. -We Cunninghams have our obligations. For 500 years now we have enjoyed enormous privileges. Privilege means power, and we must never abuse that power. We're in the midst of change, and we must ensure that change is for the best. -How do we do that? By peopling the parish with successive little Cunninghams to ferret out the mischief-makers and bring about social reform? -And why not? I'm sure you and Elizabeth will have no objection to making your contribution. Your mother was only your age when she died. We had hoped for other sons. I thought I'd never marry again. When you and Giles and Christina have gone your ways, Anna and I will have children. It is my intention to do my part to ensure the continuity of the Cunningham line. -Well, speaking on behalf of the family, all contributions gratefully received. -I suppose your father would approve of our engagement? -Well of course he will. But I think you better say nothing until after he and Anna are married. Look at you. He's behaving just like a schoolboy. -Only your father would think of a day on the river in March. Here we are. -Stay like that, now! -Like this? -Fine. Now, get ready. Well, don't take all day! It's freezing! Now-- row! All right. Excellent. Excellent! -I'm not very good at that, am I? -Thank you. -Let's hope it works a second time. -It will. Where are Clive and Anna? -Right over there, lurking behind that tree. -Are you ready, Father? -Stay just where you are! -Like this? -That's fine. Now, after three. One, two, three! -The pole's stuck. -Clive! Mind that branch! -Ah! -Clive! Anna! -I can't swim! -Fetch a boat! Anna can't swim! [SHOUTING] God, no! I can't see them! The water's as black as night! -It's Anna. We've had to call off the search. She must have been swept over the wier. -I could have saved him, if only I'd been quicker. And Anna-- -Did all you could. That water was black as pitch. -You must not blame yourself. -My father's right, Giles. -Giles. -What are you doing? Why are you working so late? -I've been developing the pictures I took when-- -You mean of Clive? -Of Clive and Anna. -Oh, you can't. -Why not? It's the only memento I have. I must see them again. I must see them now. Turn down the light, will you? The smudge! -What is it? It moved. -You saw it for yourself. It bore a marked similarity to this smudge, here. And here. And this one, here. -What on Earth is it? -The psychical research society maintains that they are photographs of the soul departing the body. -And that's what you recorded on your moving pictures? That's what we saw, just now? -No. -Then what? -What we saw was moving towards Clive. You said yourself, it moved. -Yes. -Was the smudge trying to warn Clive of danger? Did Clive see it? Did he know he was about to die? I must find out. -How can you? It's impossible. -I have to take another photograph. -Of what? -There is a widely held belief that a dead man retains the indelible image of death. -That's superstition. -Possibly. I have to photograph Clive. -Now? After all this time? After two weeks? -Not a pleasant task. But one I cannot neglect. -But even if that belief turns out to be true, what do you hope to achieve? -I've got to determine the true nature of what we've just seen. On that sheet, and on those slides. -By photographing the remains of your dead son? I can't imagine that-- -I've got to know if Clive knew he was about to die. I shall go out of my mind if I don't know. -And you expect me to help you? -I beg you, Giles. Light the flash when I tell you. Now. Nothing. Not a mark. -May I turn the light up on that? -If you like. It's all right, my boy. You needn't pretend. -Afraid I don't understand. You don't approve of what I'm doing, do you? -It would worry Christina. -You've told her? You must never tell her. Ever. -Of course not. May I speak frankly, sir? You're exhausting yourself on experiments that can prove nothing except harmful. -So you presume to know what it is I'm looking for? -By some chance your camera has recorded a strange manifestation. Well, neither of us know what it is. -Don't we? My researches into psychic phenomena show me that in Greek mythology they referred to the spirit of death. They called it the asphyx. It manifests itself only in times of danger, having existed in eternal agony. It seeks out the dying or the damned. For only by possessing those about to die is it at last released from unspeakable torment. Don't you see? The smudge we saw, the shadow. It disappeared the second Clive hit the water. -Presumably possessing him? But why doesn't it appear in the new photograph? -Possibly because it was absorbed instantly and vanished instantly. -So it manifests itself only briefly? -I should have photographed Clive's body the moment we recovered it from the water. -Please. Stop what you're doing. Now. This isn't science. You have no right to experiment with this. -It? The spirit of death. The asphyx possessed my only son. Sought him out, and in him, found release. And you say I have no right? -So you invoke your inconsolable grief as justification for a series of pointless and dangerous-- -They are not pointless! I will not have you call my work pointless! -I'm sorry. I spoke out of turn. -No, it's I who should be sorry. I didn't mean to shout. -To what do you attribute your ability to photograph the asphyx once it appears? -It can only be due to the chemical composition of the fluid I used to sensitize my photographic material. -Do you mean this stuff here? Smells pretty repugnant. -Don't touch it. It's undilute acid. -Ooh. All that you have told me is no more than mere theory. And then based only on myth. -It's only speculation, I know. But I must put such theories to the test. -How? -Well-- premise. The asphyx appears only when death threatens. Well-- -What are you doing? -You know how to operate the camera. I want you to photograph me as I go to drink from this cup. -Uh-- pointless. -Exactly. Because the asphyx knows I have no intention of killing myself. -You mean it's got an intelligence of its own? -How else would it know when to manifest itself? -Well then-- do you suppose it's intelligent enough to create danger for someone? -I doubt it. The asphyx would otherwise possess a man when he is most vulnerable. As an infant. No. It must be dependent upon circumstances which are beyond its control. So far I've only been able to speculate. I must find some way to photograph it clearly. -Yet to do that, you need to know for certain when someone's about to die. -It's all right. I won't resort to murder. -Yes. Well, neither must you put yourself in danger. -How else am I to summon up the asphyx? -But if it possesses you, you're-- -A dead man? Well, Giles. What ideas have you? -Everything points to you having to abandon your experiment, sir. -You mean, written in the stars? Don't tell me you're becoming superstitious. -Tempting providence is a pass-time of fools. -And the destiny of the great. -Sir Edward Barrett. -My dear Barrett. -You will have heard? -Heard? Heard what. -He stepped back into the dark ages. -At times you're so imprecise. -A public execution. -A hanging? When? -Tomorrow. In the market square. -Well-- is there nothing you can do to prevent it? -Nothing. With all due ceremony the authorities will intone a prayer, ritualistically snap a man's neck, and then leave him hanging there, lifeless, at the end of a rope. -I dare hardly believe it. There hasn't been a public execution for years. Who ordered it? -Judge Hall. As an example, he says, necessitated by the appalling increase in crimes of violence. Oh, the reform movement has pleaded for clemency. Deaf ears. Hugo, I want you to record it. -You mean-- photograph it? Photograph a hanging? -So that the whole barbarous spectacle is put on record. -Well-- this is not the first time we have campaigned together, and I always do everything I can to help bring about reforms. But-- I see little point in-- photographing-- -If we're to succeed in our efforts to reform then we must show people the revolting acts that are carried out in their name. Hugo please don't fail us now. -All right. I'll do it. [PEOPLE TALKING] -The Lord said thou shalt not kill. -Blessed are the merciful! -May God judge those who are responsible for this outrage! -I beseech you, in the name of humanity! -The Lord said thou shalt not kill! -Blessed are the merciful! [PEOPLE SHOUTING] -Hugo, thank you. -Good morning. -Why don't you admit what you're doing? -I'm here to put on record the violent excesses to which the authorities go in the name of law and order. -And how far will you go in the interest of your science? -Say, what do you mean? -You're here because you want to try and record the condemned man's asphyx. -Since there's no hope of saving him? -Yes. Yes. Here. Go away. -One day, Giles, I'll tell you exactly what I'm trying to do. You'll learn to see the wisdom-- -I can see no wisdom in photographing some poor wretch dangling lifeless-- the force of the drop when that trap opens will tear his backbone four inches from the base of his neck. And then they'll leave him there. -For the rest of the day. To make sure he's dead. I do find it distasteful in the extreme. But my presence here is vital to my-- -Yes. -Mine isn't. Home. MAN (OFFSCREEN): The Bible says thou shalt not kill! That scripture applies to those administering the law as well as to those living under the law! MAN (OFFSCREEN): He has no right to take a life! [PEOPLE SHOUTING] -Now get right back. Come on. Get right back. Get back. Now, get back. -It has been your last wish that no prayer be said, but is nonetheless in your interest that I beseech the almighty to have mercy upon your unrepentant soul. -Such persons as stood convicted of notorious sin we are put to open penance and punished in this world. That their souls might be saved in the day of the Lord, and that other, admonished by their example, might be the more afraid to offend. [GASPS] -Stop the execution! Cut him down! WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Let him go! He must be innocent! -Enough! That is enough! -Ah. You have the slides. -I've just this minute finished drying them. -Thank you. These will be most useful to the movement. -They're slides and moving images. -Moving images? I don't understand. -Well, I mentioned before I'd invented a device whereby I can record moving objects. Then we must show both sets of images. -No. The moving pictures I wish to keep from my own private purposes. -And what are they? -I'm afraid I cannot tell you. -Oh, come now, Hugo. We have no secrets. We must share what knowledge we glean from our researches. You've made some new discovery? -Possibly. But it is not something I wish to discuss. -You have other theories, I can tell. About what, though? The apparition at the hanging. Have you recorded that in moment? -I've told you, I don't want to say anything to anybody. -Until you're absolutely certain, of course. -Perhaps. -But Hugo-- -That is all. [CATS SCREECHING] -You do nothing by halves, do you? -No sign of the asphyx. -So what do you conclude? -It manifests itself, but for an instant. And then it's gone. Now, let's compare it with the moving pictures. -Good grief. -Shh. -I tell you, it saw me. The hanged man's asphyx, it saw me. And stopped. You saw for yourself. It seemed to be-- struggling. -It couldn't possibly have seen you, unless it's possessed of some unearthly intelligence. -Then what explanation have you? -It seems more likely it was halted by some kind of barrier. -Such as? -Well, the man didn't want to die, obviously. So perhaps he was generating some kind of resistance. -Generating? -Well, if not resistance, then-- -Well, resistance could have been generated, yes. But not by a dying man. -Well, then, by whom? -Not by whom. By what. The "Times" report speaks of some strange light. Well, they're right. It was my strange light. On the film I've just shown you, the asphyx halted. But at the precise time I was using my light booster. -I don't follow. -If I'm able to recall the asphyx because of the fluid with which I sensitized my photographic material, then why shouldn't the light my booster generates determine the asphyx's movements? -How is the light generated? -It's a phosphate compound. When I press the trigger it releases accurately measured droplets of water onto these crystals, generating a brilliant beam-- -A blinding blue light. -So. Your curiosity is getting the better of you after all. -Well, it was you who taught me the value of an inquiring mind. So tell me, what exactly are you up to? -When I've put my theories to the test, I might tell you. But you must make me a promise. Not a word to Christina. -Oh, I really think you ought to take her into your confidence. -She'd never even begin to understand. -Very well. If you think it's in her best interest to say nothing, of course. You have my word. -Good. Giles. Find me a guinea pig. -No wonder he's complaining. You've not fed him for two days. -He shall have something to eat now. Come along, boy. Food. -You're going to kill him? -I know what I'm doing. Now, let's line our little friend up. Get him into focus. Are you ready with the booster? -Yes. -The second I say now, press the trigger. Now. Save your booster. The booster! Turn on the booster! [SCREECHING] There it is. There's its asphyx. Turn off the light. You'll be able to see it better. Keep your booster on. Train the light on the asphyx. There. At the left-hand corner of the cage. Now, the next step. Let's try to transfer the asphyx into this container. Do exactly as I tell you. Now carefully-- very carefully-- bring the beam across towards this box. -I'll try. It's not easy. -Then take it slowly. Very slowly. [SCREECHING] -My left. Left! An inch more. And another. There, Giles, you're almost there. Now touch and merge. They will merge. They've got to merge! -One seems to be rejecting the other! -The one with the asphyx seems to be the dominant one. The stronger. Just keep your booster on. [SCREECHING] There, it's working! Turn off your booster! Watch and learn. -You've got it! -If we wanted to keep this asphyx we'd only have to transfer this container to the vault. The water pipe that's there, by the spring. We need only link the container to the pipe by a drip tap, and the drops of water falling on the crystals would sustain this light forever. Do you realize what we've done? -Yes. That guinea pig can't die. -There's nothing in the world can kill it now. Unless we release its asphyx. Hand me that dropper. -An antidote? -Mm-hm. -You have every reason to smile. Your experiment has been a triumph. -The little beast will be as right as rain by morning. -Can we ensnare a human asphyx? -We can try. -Father? Why are you going out? -Get along inside. You'll catch cold. We shan't be long. -But where are you going? -Do as your father says. Go inside. [SQUEAKING] -Hello. If only you could talk. You'd tell me, wouldn't you? What are they doing? Ouch! Oh. There's no need to be frightened. I won't hurt you. [SQUEAKING] What's the matter? [INAUDIBLE] to go? Very well. No biting, now. -Giles, there is something I have to tell you. And now is as good a time as any. Wait here. -Yes, sir. [COUGHING] -I've not eaten for two days. Why have you kept my food from me? -You deserve to be punished. Because you can read and write you got these wretches to protest about conditions here, didn't you? You got me into trouble, didn't you? You think yourself better than me? At least I'm strong enough to work and earn a living. -I need a doctor. Please. Get me a doctor. -You get down on your hands and knees. Or there'll be no bed for you tonight. Oh, Sir Hugo. What can I do for you, sir? -You have a fever. -A fortnight. No. Oh, please, get me a doctor. -This man is desperately ill. He is to come with me. -But Sir Hugo, you can't possibly-- -Why's he brought that poor man in here? Where did he come from? -The institution from which your father took me. -What? I don't understand. -B House. -B House? -Yes. Yes, I'm a foundling on a doorstep. I could be-- any-- I'm no match for you. -Why should that stop me loving you? -Perhaps in time it might. -No. -Then let's ask your father now. -Yes, Giles. But please tell me what you're experimenting with? I went into the laboratory? -What? -There was a-- a sort of box. Something was in it. -I'm sorry. You weren't meant to see that. -What is it? -You mustn't say anything. -Giles, please. Why won't you tell me? -Your father has sworn me to secrecy. That's the least I owe him. -But that man-- why is he here? -So, do you agree to my proposals? -I have no choice. Your hospitality has been lavish. The condemned man ate a hearty meal. What did the doctor say? -You're an educated man. A civilized man. -So you'll bury me like a gentleman? I'm to be grateful? -The doctor has done his best. -His best is not enough. -It's tubercular spine. -And the tuberculosis-- -Tell me. -Has spread to your lungs. -How long have I got? -A day. Perhaps two. -If you've no objection, I-- I should like to go to my bed. -Giles here will help you. -I need no help. I've slept in hovels and doorways. But never, I confess, amidst the paraphernalia of an laboratory. But if that is my lot, who am I to question the wisdom of my maker? Before I go, I-- I would like to ask one thing. -And what is that? -When I'm dead, spare me the dissecting table. Bury me in the earth. In life I've been to use to man nor beast. But dead, I may feed a few dried tubers. Goodnight. [WHEEZING] [SCREAM] [SCREECHING] -The trap, Giles. Trap! -Release it! He's in agony! -But first we must seal it off, to prove it can be done! [SHRIEKING] Turn your booster on. [WAILING] -Turn the box towards the asphyx. -No, please-- [SIZZLING] -Ah! My face! My face! [SCREAM] Remove the bandages. -The doctor said-- -Now. This moment. -Please, Father. Be patient. Let the doctor remove the bandages. -Leave me, child. One day I will explain. Send Giles to me. -Yes, Father. -You wanted to-- -Ugly? Yes. But I'm not required to look at it. -You shouldn't have removed the bandages. -It handicaps me in my work. And my work cannot wait. -Yes. You mean your real work. The true nature of your experiments. -So you have guessed. -Immortality. -Yes. You've seen for yourself that it is within my grasp. Trap a man's asphyx in that beam of light and seal it off so that it has no way of escape and you have immortal man. -I can't even begin to grasp such a concept. -Why? Because of the time it would take? The duration of a mere heartbeat. The blinking of an eye, so vast is eternity, having neither beginning nor middle nor end. -But why pursue immortality? -I once told Clive we are in the midst of change, and we must ensure that change is for the good of all. Well, once immortal, one could govern the course of events perpetually. And with the wisdom of each successive age and civilization. -Sir, you've lived a fine and honorable life. You have responsibilities, yes. But one of them requires you to know when to relinquish power. -Giles, I need your help. I want you to sum up my own asphyx, to trap it, and put it in the vault next to my son. -Think of the future. Imagine your grief when Christina predeceases you! -You give me an idea. -What -You love Christina, don't you? -Yes. Should you approve, we'd like to marry. -I had expected that. Help me to immortalize myself and I will immortalize you and Christina. Well? What do you say? Let me tempt you more. Think, man. Think of the power. -How can you be sure that nothing will go wrong? -For myself I am prepared to take the risk. If the experiment fails and I die, then it is God's will. If I survive forever, then it is also God's will. -What do you have in mind? -Tomorrow I will show you. Let me explain. If the experiment works, you and I will seal off my asphyx in here. Giles, I want you to order me a lock for the door of the vaults, a lock for which there is no key. A lock that will make that door impregnable. -A combination lock. -Exactly. I must ensure that my asphyx cannot escape, and that I must never be tempted to release it. The number of the lock you will write on a piece of paper and put it in my desk. When I am immortal I will destroy the paper. -And should the experiment fail? -And I die? Then it is here I wish to lie, alongside Clive. In the event of my death you will take a letter to my executors. You'll find it in my bedroom. Do you understand? -Perfectly. How do you propose to summon your asphyx? -What form of death have I chosen? -You speak with great confidence. -I have spent much time praying for guidance. -But what method? [SQUEAK] -How on Earth did you get here? What's the matter? Now, you stay there. Quite all right. Come on. I better let you out. -I have built a small lever in the side of the chair so that I may increase the current while you operate the beam. I must allow the voltage time to build. Otherwise you will not have time to contain my asphyx. Is that clear? -Off you go, then. Off with you. -As tightly as possible. Now take the straps and fasten them. Across my thighs and across my chest. -Father? Father, are you asleep? -You are very quiet, Giles. -I'm afraid. -Of what? There is nothing to fear. -I don't think I can go through with this. -You have spoken of a debt you owe me. If you mean what you say, just do as I ask. -But if you were to die-- -There is no turning back. As tightly as possible. Are you ready with the booster? -Yes. -There are enough crystals? -I've allowed for the widest possible margin of error. Switch on. [SCREECHING] The other booster! [SHRIEKING] -Father! -For God's sake, don't touch him! Come here! -Giles! -Come here! -My father! What are you doing to him? You must help him! -Listen. Every second is vital. So just do as I tell you. Put your hand on this trigger. Whatever happens, don't let go. -Is he all right? -Yes, I think so. Now, you're going to swing your light on its pivot. By doing so, you'll double its progress. Slowly. Slowly. Swing your light towards me. Towards this light. I've got to absorb your beam into mine, do you understand? I've got it! You can let go now. Don't touch! -Father. -He's going to be all right. -Father, it's me. It's Christina. -You saved his life. -Giles. Giles, that thing in the box-- -He'll sleep until morning. In two or three days he'll be fine. We were conducted an experiment with electricity. It got out of hand. -You're not telling me the truth. -Very well. Come with me. What, we're to leave him? -I promised your father that whatever happened I'd tell you nothing about his work. -But Giles, he nearly died. You owe it to me to explain now. -Help me with this. If I tell you, you must promise to forget everything I've said. -I can make no such promise. Unless you explain-- -Just do as I say. Take the other handle. Oh! 83, 92 86-- By ensuring a constant but regulated flow of water falling into little drops onto the crystals, your father's asphyx will be ensnared for eternity. -Then, whatever happens, he cannot die? -Never. He's now immortal. -How can I believe you? -If she hadn't arrived when she did, you might have died! That the experiment might need two pairs of hands was an oversight that could have proved fatal. So I had to tell her. -And of course she doesn't believe you. -Why should she? -Then we must convince her, Giles. -I've just taken your father to the station. He's going to London with Barrett to-- give a lecture to the psychical research society. -Oh. When will he be back? -Later tonight. -Then we have an evening together. -You seem upset. -No, Giles. -You're not telling me the truth, Christina. -There's nothing I'd hide from you. -Christina, my darling, if something is causing you anxiety, you mustn't hesitate to tell me. -Very well. I'm afraid for my father. -Afraid? Why? Because he's immortal? -Yes. Because it's wrong. -Your father believes his experiments are only for the best. -How can they be? He should realize that none of us was every meant to be immortal. That we're, all of us, merely creatures of God, not God. -There is so much he can achieve by being immortal. For you, for me. -How? -You want us to stay together for as long as we can? -Nothing would make me happier. -Then let him immortalize us both. Christina, are you afraid of facing everlasting life with me? -Oh, if only I could believe. Truly believe it was possible. -Your father is a brave and brilliant man. He will prove to you that immortality is possible. -Giles, how? -Tomorrow I will show you. -You must tell me now. -Tomorrow. It's time for dinner. -Good morning. His bed's not been slept in. -He's all right. -Tell me where he is! -Come with me. -Why did you lie when you said he'd gone to London? -There's nothing to fear. -I am afraid, don't you understand? -Your father and I will put your mind at rest. -Why the secrecy? -Fetch me a class of water, will you? -Oh! -My eyes. My eyes. -Put the lamp down. Take this. Slowly. Slowly. -Your father's quite safe. This coffin was airtight. He's been shut in it all night, and he survived. What further proof do you need? -Rose, tell Jenkins I am not at home to callers. -Yes, sir. Well, Christina. Have you decided? -I'm still uncertain. -Giles has told me that you would like to marry. -That is so. -Then you have my blessing. -Father, thank you. -Have you decided when you would like to marry? -At once? -We have your father's permission. -But there are conditions. -What? -Conditions? -You have had plenty of time to think about it, and you know there is nothing to fear. You must allow me to immortalize you. -But I am afraid. -Unless you overcome your fears, there will be no marriage. -How can you? How can you use-- -Christina. Please leave us. I wish to talk to your father. I'll not allow you to force her into anything. -She is so obdurate. -She has every right to be. I was, too. -I've told Sir Edward the master's not at home, Miss Christina, but he insists on seeing you. So I've shown him to the study. -But I-- all right, Jenkins. -Yes, Miss Christina. -Ah, my dear Christina. Do you know when your father is returning? -I'm afraid I don't. -I see. -Then please tell him I shall call again tomorrow. -No, please don't go. I-- I'd like to talk to you. -I can make her. And I will. -Let me talk to her again. -Very well. Allay her fears, if you can. -My dear, you must tell me what it is specifically that upsets you. Explain to me the precise nature of his work. -He's been able not only to-- something-- on moving pictures. But he's also-- -Christina. -I'd like to talk to you. -Giles, I can explain. -Giles, I want to know what it is that Sir Hugo is doing that so upsets his daughter. -I'm sorry. I can't tell you. -I urge you explain. Is it something to do with the moving images he told me about? Of the hanged man? What has he recorded? What does it show him? What has he discovered? For the sake of everyone, I must know what his work entails. Its ramifications. If Sir Hugo has made a breakthrough, then-- -I have. But I do not wish you to know what it is. You have no right to pry. How dare you insinuate yourself into my household? -Hugo, I'd hoped-- -Hoped to what, exactly? Concern yourself with my work when it's none of your business? -I called to ask you if you'd chair a special seminar. And to tell you about a very exciting new research project. -I have projects of my own. And they have nothing to do with you. Now, if you will excuse us. Jenkins! Sir Edward is leaving. What did you tell him? -Nothing, Father. -I always thought I had my own daughter's trust. Her absolute trust. -You do have. I-- -No one must know anything of my work! Do you understand? -I only said that you were making yourself tired. -I am not tired. Merely impatient. Have you made up your mind? -She's in no condition to decide anything now. -Ever since Clive died, and my beloved Anna, I've wanted only to ensure that the Cunningham line should be continued. -But if it has come to nothing-- -Do not question me. I want to marry Giles, I want you to have children. I will immortalize you all. The Cunninghams shall survive forever. Having lost Clive, your brother, I must never lose you. -Then I will do whatever makes you happy. -Christina, my dear, you must try to understand, if you can, what compels me. -I do, Father. I can't! Please. Please let me use the chloroform. -You must remain conscious while the blade descends. The asphyx must sense your fear. It will otherwise not appear. -Your father loves you, and I love you. And we've made sure that nothing can go wrong. Gently. So -As a precaution I have linked the drop taps direct to the water main by this rubber pipe. So there shall be no danger of the water supply running out during the experiment. Giles has the brake of the guillotine and his booster lever at hand so that he can use both at the same time. Giles? Then release the blade. But very slowly. Give the asphyx time to appear. Then, when I have trapped it, hold the blade. [SHRIEKING] More crystals! Give your light more crystals! It's failed. It's failed. -No. No. We've got the asphyx. It's no good, I tell you! -We must save her! -It's too late! -You've killed her. Oh, you've killed Christina. -I had to let her die. She couldn't have lived. Her head, it was-- -You-- -You can't kill me, Giles. No one can kill me. Ever. -What are you doing? -The number of the combination lock. -What do you want it for? -I want to go to the vault. -Why? We've laid Christina at rest. There's no need to go there. -I have really need, Giles. -I don't understand. -My asphyx. -What? It's sealed off, no one can get to it. -But I must. -To ensure that it's safe? I'll do that for you. -I'm going to release my asphyx. -You no longer want immortality. -Damned to eternal guilt? Damned to eternal remorse? -And if you release you asphyx-- -The key to the combination lock. It's here somewhere. -I asked you, if you release your asphyx-- -There's nothing stopping me. I want only to atone. I want to join my children whose deaths I hold myself responsible for. I want to join Anna. -We made a pact, remember? -And now I ask you. Release me from my obligation. -You were to immortalize me. -But can't you see that providence is not to be tampered with? -Between us, we have killed the woman we loved. How am I to expunge my guilt? That may take time. So I must become immortal so that time is mine. Besides, I must survive. To carry on your work. -Then I will keep my promise. If you feel impelled to carry on with the experiments, then you surely must. But in return you must make me one promise. When I have immortalized you, release my asphyx and let me end my life. Let me join my children. -Hello. [CLICKING] Hugo plans, and Hugo schemes. Hm? I, too, can plan and scheme. [RATTLING] -I have refined the light booster so that the trigger, once pressed, holds itself fast. It is then safe for me to attend to the second booster-- -I've done that. I've renewed the crystals. I've been patient. -You must not forget your promise to me, Giles. -Rest assured. Everything will go as planned. -Don't fail me as I failed Christina. The number of the combination lock. Is it in my desk? I'll go and look. -Don't worry. If anything should happen to me you'll find the number written in this envelope. -You are wise to take every precaution. -Now I tested the block for the area. -And the gas? -And the oxygen. -What? -Well, once I'm in there, it may take you some time before you can hoist it up and release me. So if anything does go wrong, god forbid, you can turn off the gas and feed through the oxygen. -Well. Are you ready? -And waiting. [GAS HISSING] -The light booster! It won't work! Oxygen! I'll give you oxygen! -Christina. [CRASHING] -Oh my god. Giles! I've killed you. I've killed you, too. GILES (VOICEOVER): We made a pact, remember? You were to immortalize me. Between us, we killed the woman we loved. -My asphyx. My asphyx. GILES (VOICEOVER): We killed the woman we loved. How am I to expunge my guilt? That may take time. So I must become immortal so that time is mine. You were to immortalize me. How am I to expunge my guilt. That may take time. Time. HUGO (VOICEOVER): I only want to atone. I must survive. I must be immortal, so that time is mine. [SQUEAKING] -I obey God's will, my friend. My only friend. My eternal and everlasting friend. My companion in immortality.
