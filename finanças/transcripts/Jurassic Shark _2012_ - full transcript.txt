Megalodon, which means "big tooth" is an extinct species of shark that lived approximately 1.5 to 28 million years ago. Regarded as one of the largest and most powerful predators in vertebrate history. Megalodon probably had a profound impact on the structure of marine communities. Fossil remains of Megalodon suggest that this giant shark reached a length of 16 meters. Are you sure we're allowed to be here? What do you mean? It's quiet, no one here to bother us. Yeah, that's what bothers me. This is the perfect piece of beach in the middle of summer. Where is everybody else? Who cares, let's just enjoy it. Mr. Chairman, sir, Lincoln Grant here. Oh, well, have you some good news for me, Dr. Grant? Yes sir, I do. Stage two is about to begin. You wanted to be informed. Fine, now I received a memo from one of your people regarding some previously undiscovered pocket in the earth's crust. What is that all about? It's just an overexcited scientist trying to make a name for herself. We discovered an ice pocket above an oil bearing zone. No, she seemed to think there was some safety and environmental concerns? The ice started to melt the moment we broke the seal. We're draining all the water into the lake. There's nothing to worry about, it's just water. I've invested a lot of money into this wildcat well of yours, Doctor. Well then, you may be pleased to hear, Mr. Chairman, that the oil reservoir we're looking at is three times the size we first surveyed. Three times, hey? That's right. Now, you are satisfied that all safety and environmental protocols will be met. Yes sir, I am. Well then, I don't see any need to delay any further. You may proceed, Dr. Grant. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes. So, what's the deal with this place anyways? Some kind of secret retreat or something? I used to paddle past here all the time as a kid. I always thought it would be a cool spot to hang out. Looks like a total dive now though. Yeah, this company used to own this island, like an oil drilling company or something. If they're drilling for oil, why's it so quiet? They're not drilling anymore, you spaz. I heard they abandoned the place. So, what's up with this place now? If they're not drilling anymore they should totally open this up to the public or something. I don't know. Once they stopped the drilling folks just left the island to itself. Oh, that's like totally depressing. I know, you wanna go for a swim? Like in a pool or something? No you spaz, in the lake. I don't think so. What're you like scared or something? No. Are ya? No. Are ya? No! You sure? Okay, maybe a little. Why? You're gonna think it's stupid. Don't worry, I already know you're stupid. Thanks, you're such a cow. I'm kidding, seriously, why? You gotta like promise you won't tell anyone. All right. Swear. I said, all right. Okay. So, I don't like swimming in lakes, because I'm afraid of sharks. You serious? Serious. That's like totally stupid, you know? Oh God, you're such a bitch. You know there's no sharks in fresh water, right? I told you you'd think it was stupid. You watch too many movies, you know? Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant! What is it? We can't proceed with the second stage. We've already had this discussion. All safety protocols have been met. What protocols? We've never dug this deep before. I mean, the early samples show... The early samples were inconclusive. As were the samples from site B, now calm. Well, I just need another day to confirm the readings from the underground cavern we found. You've already had a week. The cavern was just full of ice. It's just a bubble in the crust, who cares? I disagree. When it melted God knows what was released into the lake. What kind of bacteria or worse. Now, you're just being overly dramatic. Look, the samples we got are 80 million years old. I just need some more time to make sure we didn't release some deadly toxin, or bacteria into the water. I'll go to the board. Go ahead, I've already spoken to the Chairman. Ooh, trumped! Really? It's too deep. You're drilling too deep. You worry too much. Besides, stage two began 20 minutes ago. What could possibly go wrong? Oh no, we drilled too deep! What the F? Relax, we used to get earthquakes all the time in this area. And that huge explosion? Probably just some bored hillbillies or something. You are like a total psycho. Totally. We should get the hell outta here. You need to relax, you know. Come on out for a swim. You have totally lost your mind, you know. You see, nothing to worry about. Stop it! What're you gonna do about it? Ugh, you. Oh my God. Oh, you're so gonna get it. Tiffany? Tiffany, Tiffany! Tiff, Tiff? Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany! Haul ass boys! Move, move, move! Oh man, oh man, the cops. Take it easy man, we're good. She killed that cop man. She put the gun in his mouth and blew his brains out. Yeah, yeah, help me with this. She's crazy. Hey, don't let her hear you say that. But. Look, you're my only brother. Now help me with this. 62 million, can you believe it, Doug? A cool 62 million. Shut up, just help me with the gate. What're you gonna do with your share? Jack, the gate. Right. Idiot, you damaged that painting, and I'll take it out of your hide. Sorry, Barb. Look Barb, don't worry about my little brother. He's slow, but he's dependable. He better be. Now, get it on the boat. Don't talk to me that way. I just saved your miserable life. Now, help me get this thing on the damn boat. Barb, we gotta go. No motor, I don't want them to hear us. We did it, we're free, we got away. Cops never expected a water getaway. Was there any doubt? What direction boss? There's an island a couple of miles ahead. We'll hide out there. Roger. There it is! Sit down, you dolt! You'll tip us! Steer toward that land. What was that? Did you see that? I saw it too. There's something in the water. The painting, where is it? I think it went into the water. What was that? I don't know, but holy shit it was big. Everyone, just shut up! I think it's gone, it's gone. Something just brushed past my leg. What? Something's got me! Grab, grab my hand! Grab it, grab it! Grab it, grab it! We're totally here. Oh, my God! Yes! Look at this place! Woo, woo! Oh my God, it's gonna be amazing. Let's go, let's go. Can we get a little help here, please? Mike, could you? Sure. I bet ya they didn't even read my proposal. They just saw a chance to spend a day at the beach. I thought you wrote a terrific proposal. A major oil company illegally drilling out on Elber Island, and the prop liked it too. Nice throw, and here I thought you did everything like a girl. I do do everything like a girl. This isn't a holiday, ladies. Can we get a little help here, please? Oh, chill out Jill. We're just checking out the scenery. This isn't a day at the beach. Well okay, this is a day at the beach, but you know what I mean. I need this for my journalism class. If I can expose the illegal drilling, I'm a shoe-in for that internship at C-News. Ah, you need this, we don't. It's two days on a private island with nothing but the sun and a beach before spring break ends. So, why did I even bring you? Oh um, because my car got us to the boat. And my credit card paid for the boat. Oh besides, you might just enjoy yourself out there as well. What're you talking about? Uh, you don't see it? See what? I uh, I got everything, so, we ready to go? Yeah, let's load up. Yeah, let's just go. What the hell was that thing man? It looked like a shark. A big ass shark. No way, sharks live in the ocean, that's a lake. Yeah, there's some freshwater sharks. That's crazy man. That's enough. One of you need to go back out there and fetch it. Fetch it? Barb, with all due respect, did you see what just happened there? A flippin' shark ate Jack. Ain't no way I'm going back in there. Whoever retrieves the painting gets half of Jack's take added to their own. Fine. Jerry, no. Don't worry about it man. What if that shark's still out there? I'm sure it's long gone. Besides, it just ate. It's about 300 feet out. If I calculated it right, parallel with that strip of land. So, my share and half of Jack's. That's right. Fine, but if I don't make it back, my share goes to Rich. Won't be gnawing on Jack forever. Right. You really are a heartless bitch. Look, there he is! Oh shit, look! Shark, Jerry, shark! He's gonna make it, he's gonna make it! It's gone. Jerry. I can't believe it. He was almost ashore. He should've made it. Ooh, ooh, oh yeah, work it. Okay, don't waste the batteries. Oh, how much further? What, oh, we should be seeing it anytime soon. There it is. How much longer? Five, 10 minutes, tops. Thank God, then nothing but surf, sand, and sun. Ah, paradise. You guys really aren't gonna help us. You and big strong Mike can manage on your own. Besides, we don't know anything about what you're doing, so we'd just get in the way. Yeah. Whoa, whoa, watch where you're steering. Did we hit something? I don't see anything. It came from over there. Oh my God! Go, go, go, go, go go go! Guys, what is that thing? It looked like a shark. No no, it didn't look like a shark to me. Oh my God, there it is! Where! Oh my God, there it is! Go, go, go, go. Faster, faster! Anybody see anything? Guys, maybe he gave up. Oh, I hope so. Whoa! Tia, Kristen, Mike! Jill! Oh my God, oh my God! Oh my God. Oh my God, what happened? I don't know. After that thing hit the boat we just, we started swimming and then... Oh my God, what happened to you? It's nothing, it's nothing. Did either of you see Mike? Did he make it to shore? I don't know. God, Mike, Mike! Mike! Mike, Mike! Mike, Mike, Mike! Mike! Mike, over here! Mike! What is it? The camera. Mike had the camera. Oh my God! What the hell? What the hell, is that Mike? Let's just go. No no, no no! Keep it together. But Mike, but Mike. I know, I know! Hey, hey, hey, over here! Remember what I said. Play it cool. Get away from the water. There's something in the water. Are you guys okay? Are you hurt? We're okay, but, but Mike. That thing in the water killed our friend. Oh, I'm so sorry. It killed two of our friends as well. Do you have a boat? That thing capsized it down by the rocks. It must be on the bottom by now. Who are you and how did you get here? Oh, I'm sorry. My name's Barb and this is Rich and Doug. I'm Kristen, this is Tia and Jill. Well, what was that thing? It looked like a shark. I have never seen a shark that big or ugly before. Come on, let's get you three warmed up. Here. Thanks. This is all Jill's idea. She wanted to come and check out the refinery. Bug up her ass about big oil. Refinery? Some big oil company decided to build a research center out here. You mean, there are others on this island? There's a lab complex just on the other side. It's where they did their illegal research, but it's deserted. I was hoping to find a working radio still there. Ours got smashed and there's no cell service here. Do you have a radio? Illegal research? Illegal research has been going on here. Stop it, Jill! Mike is dead because of your vendetta. You're blaming me? How dare you. Stop it ladies. This is not the time, Jill. Let her go. She just needs a moment. What happened to your boat? That thing trashed it. That thing is a megalodon. What? Rich. It's a shark, a monster shark. Forgive him. He just lost his brother this morning to that thing. How did you guys get to be here? Hey, get that camera off me! Hey, I was just, this is important. We should document what's going on here. Fair enough, but my friend doesn't like his picture taken. Why are you here? I already told you. No, you didn't. We're tourists. We were out for a sail when that thing sank our boat. Someone's gonna find us, right? People know we're here. Somebody's gonna realize we're missing, and, and they'll send somebody out to find us. That's if the monster doesn't get them first. Rich, that's enough. You're scaring the girls. You saw that thing. No one's gonna be able to get near this island without being eaten. Jerry would've known what to do if you hadn't sent him back into the water. That's enough. Rich, what happened to Jerry was an accident. Both him and Jack are accidents. Right. My camera, please. I promise I won't film you guys. I just want footage of that shark thing. It's gonna be dark soon. I suggest we spend the night here. Build a fire, and explore the island in the morning. See if we can find that research center, signal for help. And we should keep the fire going in case someone sees it. Good plan. Oh, this is really happening, right? We should get moving before it gets too hot. The research center's on the west side of the island. About a five hour walk. We could go by the beach. No, I'm not going near the water. I agree with the lady. I say we cut across the land. It might be quicker, but I don't know what animals live on this island. It might be more dangerous. More dangerous than the shark? I thought this island was abandoned. Why do I keep hearing machinery all the time? I don't know. Let's just go. What're we gonna do about them? Don't worry, I've got a plan. Still have your radio? Yeah, and I turned it off like you said. What about Rich? He doesn't have one. He doesn't know we have one. Good. What about the rendezvous? How long's the buyer gonna wait? The pickup wasn't until tonight. We have that long to get the goods and get off this God forsaken island. Amen to that. What about the camera? I palmed the tape. How? When I took it from you. I'm sorry about Mike. He had a thing for you, you know. He what? Why do you think he gave up his vacation? To carry around equipment for you? I thought he was coming because of you. Me, no. Aren't you missing something? You seriously can't be this clueless. You're crazy. How long have you known? Since the second grade. How much farther? It should be just over that rise. Listen, if anything was to happen to me. Don't start with that. We're gonna be fine. Tell that to Mike. I'm sorry, that was uncalled for. No, you're right. I guess I knew. I just sort of tune you out. I don't have time for a boyfriend right now. If not now, then when? If anything was to happen. Nothing is gonna happen. But if it does promise me you'll look after Tia, okay? She's the only sister I have. Okay. Oh, thank God. Hello, we need help! Oh Tia, wait for us. She's like a two year old. What is this place? Hello, hello! Hello, is anybody here? I knew this place was here up to no good. Now is not the time to piss off the only people who can get us off this island. Fair enough. Now what? See if anybody's here. Try and find a radio. What if they recognize us from the news? We kept our masks on, so there's no way. We just stick to the plan. We should split up. You and Rich, try and find a radio. Got it, come on. Look! Tia, like I said, a two year old. Tia! Oh my God! No no, no no, no no, no. Jill? Wait, that man's still alive. What? We've got you, we've got you now. Help me, help me. It's okay. I need water. I'll go get you some water. No no, no no. Stay away from the water. What is that thing? Too deep, we, we drilled too deep. Unleashed a predator we haven't seen in two hundred million years. How's that possible? This is getting tiresome, who cares. Excuse me, but rude much. What the hell. Oh my God. I knew something seemed off about your story. Whatever, help him up. Here, come here. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We need a boat or a plane. Something to get off this island with. There's nothing. The shark destroyed them all. What do you mean it destroyed them all? It cut off any means of escape. It's not gonna let us leave the island. Bullshit, it's just a fish. No, it's not. That's enough. You two, help him, come with us. Where are we going? Fishing. When your shark tipped us into the water we lost something very valuable. Now you're gonna help us get it back. Wait, we're not going in the water. I wasn't thinking of you. Since this is all your fault, I hope you can swim. No, no, you can't. Well? Then you might as well shoot me. I go in that water, I'm dead anyway. Hmm, how about to save a life? No, no. No. No. She's just a kid. And now you get to decide if she sees her next birthday. Okay, okay, okay, I'll do it. Wise choice. Hey Doc, you might wanna lose the bloody lab coat. It would be like barbecue sauce to the critter. It's about 300 feet out. Can't miss it. Cool. All right, now that he's feasting, we'll send somebody else out. Who's next? Idiots, they've gone into the woods. After them! Where to? Over to the building. Maybe we can find a radio or something and call for help. Oh my God, they're shooting at us! Run, run! Do not shoot them. We need them alive. That wasn't me. What, Rich, can you hear me? Do not shoot them. We need them alive. Forget it, we need to sacrifice the girls for the shark. Dead or alive. Rich, what the hell man. No! I'm sorry. A good swing. Geez, wait long enough? Sorry, can we go? Yeah, wait the gun. Go, go, go, go! Are you crazy? We need them alive. They're gonna feed the shark while we get the goods. It's never gonna let us off the island. Get a grip. I'm sorry about your brother, but it's just a fish. Doug, Doug, are you there? What's happening? Get it together or she's gonna skin you alive. Yeah, I'm here. They ran off, but I think I know where they're going. We're gonna cut them off. Are you with me? I'm with you. Are you with me? I'm with you. Good, I don't wanna have to kill you. I don't wanna be left alone with the ice queen. No, no, no, I can't guys. No, come on. We can still find a radio or a boat, come on. What's that? No, no, no, no! Don't do that again. Here are the lovely ladies. All ready to be helpful. We'll have to wait until morning. We can't see anything out on the water. What about the rendezvous? There'll be another, but it won't matter if we don't get the package back. Now, are you ladies gonna give anymore trouble? You're chum, bitch. Tie them up and then let's all get some sleep. Tomorrow's gonna be a busy day. It's my turn now. You get some sleep. Yes, ma'am. I know you're awake. I heard the change in your breathing. From one girl to another, thank you. I wouldn't be too quick with the thanks. You know what I mean. You're welcome. So, what did you steal? A painting. Anything I would know? No. What's so funny? It's a Copley. Art's never really been my strong suit. To me painting means with a roller. John Singleton Copley. He was an American painter from Boston. He died about 200 years ago. So it must be worth a lot of money. Maybe not to you, but to the right collector. So how did you steal it? Slight of hand really. That and a distraction. Keep a cop busy at the bank next to a museum. While they evacuated for safety we were posing as security helping to secure the museum. So when the cops made their move on the bank we were already securing the priceless artwork. Hmm, whoa, but then it didn't turn out the way you'd hoped. No, we got pulled over by a fuckin' traffic cop for running a stop sign. By then, our timetable was blown. We barely made it to our getaway boat and now this. You never did say what was so funny. The painting, it's Copley's Watson and the Shark. A depiction of the first recorded shark attack. I know how to get your painting. How? No. I don't think you have a lot to bargain with. See, that's where you're wrong. I know something you don't. And what might that be? I know you're more worried about missing your rendezvous than you're letting on, and sooner or later someone's gonna realize that they haven't heard from research center and come looking, and I know how to scare off sharks. Even big ass ugly ones like that. And what might that be? Dynamite will keep it away. Yeah, that'd be great if we had any. I'll tell you where you can find some. On the condition that you let us go. If you can keep that shark away you have a deal. I'd shake your hand, but I'm a little tied up right now. First light's in three hours. You really need to work on your negotiating skills. Once you told me that there was dynamite on this island, how hard did you think it was for me to figure out where? I told you there was dynamite so you'll let us go, right? You're a funny girl. I like that. Now, get her up. What, what's going on? Frying pan, fire. Okay ladies, so here's the plan, and if you don't follow my plan as I describe, Mr. Doug here will take out his gun and blow your brains out. Any questions? No, good. Our friend is out there, see him? Rich, you're up. He's coming in! Good job kid, now keep a lookout. Ladies, your turn. What, no no, no no, no. We're not going in that water. Tia, I'm going in with you. They need us alive. They'll keep the shark at bay. Jill, Jill, I'm not, I can't. Tia, nothing's gonna happen to you. I'm gonna be with you the whole time. Oh my God. The explosions will keep it away. We'll go in, we'll get the painting, and then we'll come out of the water, and then you'll leave us alone, right? That's right. Nothing's going to happen to you. I promised Kristen. Kristen? This is all cute and such, but can we get a move on ladies? Let's go. Throw another one in. Here it is. On three. Okay. One, two three. Shark! Dynamite! Shark! Dynamite! Oh no you don't. What're you doing? Oh. There's no way. It's stuck to the bottom. I can't lift it. Try harder. Try harder? Get rid of the shark first. Shark's off again. Back to work. My God, they're gonna kill us, aren't they? Not if the shark kills us first. What're we gonna do? I'm thinking. Rich, he's got the gun and the dynamite. We take him out we got a chance. Time's a wasting ladies. You don't play with a shark. Rich, throw in another stick. You two get back out there. Just give us a second. We just need to catch our breath. Where are you going? We just need to catch our breath. Rich, any sign of that shark? I don't think so. Shark, there it is! Drop the gun. Jill! I'm fine, hurts like hell though. Drop the gun! Put the gun down girlie. You first. Doug, Doug! What? Focus. Oh Rich. Doug! Huh? I need you to go over there, and grab that gun from that girl. What, what if she shoots me? Then I'll shoot her. Right. All right Missie, I'm gonna come over there and relieve you of that gun. All right Missie. We don't want anyone else to get hurt now, do we? Look out! What? Tia, Tia, the gun. It doesn't matter. You silly girls. You wasted all your bullets on a God damned fish? Now, you're gonna get your ass back in that water, and get me my painting. No. Wrong answer. You, little bird, are gonna get your skinny ass back in that water, and bring me my painting. Or what, you'll kill us? Lady, between you and it you're no threat. How dare you! Oh my... God, we have to kill it. What? We have to kill it. Why, if we stay on shore that thing can't get us. Help will come. It may only be an animal, but it's a smart animal, and sooner or later it's gonna realize it doesn't have any more food, and it's gonna go looking for some. We're so close to the shorelines, oh no. What would happen if that thing found a populated beach elsewhere? How do we kill it? The hillbilly way. This isn't working. I know, we need bait. I'll go. No, I'll go. Jill. I promised Kristen I'd look after you. I'm bleeding. Even if that thing is a hundred miles away it'll still sniff me out. Besides, I throw like a girl. I throw like a girl too. Hey you ugly fish enough with the junk food. You want gourmet? Tia! I see it! When I yell duck! Tia! Be ready! Tia! Now! Tia, Tia! Is it? It's dead, you got it. Oh my God! Oh my gosh, what do we do now? I don't know. I'm sure help will come soon, I hope. I can't even think about that now. Fair enough. What do you wanna do? Here you go. Thanks Lisa. You're welcome. I don't get it. I swear, I don't. What don't you get? You're telling me that that is your stepdaughter? Yeah. That beautiful specimen standing right over there is your stepdaughter. Careful, don't make me knock you out. Well, what I mean is I've seen your wife. Didn't I just say I'll knock you out? Look, you and I both know that your wife is a large, burly, Rubenesque woman. Now, that does not look like she shares any genes with that, with your wife. Well, it's like they say, even big, ugly things can have offspring.
