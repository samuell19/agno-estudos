Sir, SP Zaman is here to meet you. Yes, what is the issue? Abdullah has been transferred to judicial custody. I wish to investigate him in prison. Why do you want to do that? He is ready to record his statement. The case is very important, sir. The media is relentlessly following up on it and trying to prove these terrorists innocent. I don't want to take any risk. Okay. You will be given the permission by tomorrow. I have another request, sir. Yes, tell me. I suggest that we confine Abdullah under foolproof security and strict vigilance. He should not be allowed to meet his family until the questioning is over. He should be kept under solitary confinement. I understand your concern. We will ensure that special arrangements are made for the prisoner. Both of you will assist SP Zaman starting today. -Ali? -Yes. This is Mirza Khan. DSP Special Branch. Mirza Khan, this is Mr. Ali. ASP Crime Branch. I hope your team will perform efficiently. For how long have you been in this service? I joined six months ago after the completion of my training. Are you a junior officer? I have been serving for 20 years. I was appointed as an ASI when the IG was an ASP. I hope that by the time I am promoted as the IG... you will not continue to be the DSP. The file gives an incomplete account of the story. Only Abdullah can give us a clear picture. Sir, you don't need to worry. There are many Pakistanis who are gunned down on the borders of Iran, Turkey and Greek by the forces, in a similar way. Although, nothing is mentioned about it. And here, the media is creating a fuss. You are right, Mirza. Sir, are you sure that they are terrorists? Some of the facts are missing. As soon as I get hold of them, I will forward my report to the higher authorities. Please arrange my meeting with Abdullah, immediately. We know of each other by now. This is my third year at the Special Branch. This is a really tough job, Abdullah. I'm far away from my family. Well... what about your family? What about your son Gullalai? Has he got a job yet? Or, is he still jobless? Sir. How do you know about my elder son? Not only about your son... I'm aware about your entire family. Your daughter Gullgotti got married and left for Swat. You and your wife visited her when her son had a bout of Hepatitis. Seventeen installments of the truck are yet to be paid. Five months to go before you can get the amount from the committee scheme draw which is worth 2500 rupees a month. You have a debt of 1300 rupees with a general store. It's strange, sir. You know everything about me. But, why don't you have the facts regarding my case? Well, that's true. This is what all policemen do. We are aware about every nook and corner of the world except what we are looking for. I mentioned some facts about your life which signify that... you were in dire need of money at that time. A poor man has only one craving, sir. Money. How can I deny it, Abdullah? That the need for money may have convinced you to help the terrorists. This money could be from some other sources too. Sir, I am a poor laborer. I earn by selling my skill and not my faith. Let's see. Let time decide. I just came to introduce myself. We will meet again. But certainly, our next meeting... will not be confined to mere introduction. Be ready. Get more information about this driver's whereabouts. Try and get some information from the place he resides. If necessary, arrest and interrogate some people. -I need some proof. -Okay, sir. I need solid and accurate proof against this driver. Hello, constable! Constable! Please listen to me. What is it? Where is my friend, Shinkai, the cleaner? Where is he? He is having a hard time in prison. He has not even been transferred to judicial custody. Please don't torture me. I have not committed any crime. You will have to record the statement. He has not even spent 48 hours here bearing this torture. If he is here for another day, he may also admit to Lady Diana's murder. He is not a novice, sir! He will gradually surrender himself. Please make a note of this. Until Abdullah's statement is recorded in front of the tribunal we'll keep both of them under strict vigilance. Indeed, sir! But I have heard that SP Zaman is taking a keen interest in this case. He could be a hurdle. Please come in, Mirza! Have a seat. What's new? Sir, this is the master file of those foreigners. You might find some relevant details in here. Okay, I will go through it. Well... what about the hard disk that was found from their belongings? That has been sent to the record room. I will inform you as soon as I receive an update. Okay, thank you. Stop! Both of us have to change our attire before we reach the main road. Just wait here. We need a place where we can get changed. Let's go! Come on! Hurry up. SP Zaman... has called you. Yes, yes! You've mentioned this time and again. And I have heard it so many times. I know that you picked him up from Kuchlak road. But this is not the answer to my question. My question is... why did you pick them up without knowing anything about them? Why did they accompany you if they were strangers? Sir. It was just bad luck. I picked them up for some money. That's it. Abdullah! Every day there are thousands of vehicles that pass by the highway. Why did they get into your truck? What was your intention while passing by the Kharotabad police station? What was your plan? Were the Tajiks planning an attack with bombs on their bodies? -Tell me! -I never even met them before. Then why is your name written on that hard disk? I don't really know. I am not an accomplice to any of his intentions. Sir, he'll not admit it. Hand him over to me, for five minutes. Okay, Abdullah! I'm not hasty. You have ample amount of time to think. Relax for now. After that, a long journey is waiting for you. What are you thinking? Have your tea, it's getting cold. I don't want it, constable. But, thank you very much. I am Rahim Bakhsh. Head constable. Number 713. If you need something, just tell me. You are always lost in thought. Constable, when will my family come to meet me? I will let you know. Do you have anyone who will come here? I have a son named Gullalai. If he will come to meet me, his mother will be happy. Alas, my fate! Today seems to be an unlucky day. What happened? Is everything okay? It seems like your mother has reprimanded you. Dear friend, why don't you accompany your father as a cleaner? You'll earn some money, at least. Are you in your senses? Dare you give me your advice again. -You've spoiled my mood. -My friend, listen to me. Why are you upset? -He is short-tempered. -Yes. Ignore him! Mother! Mother, I'm hungry. Get me something to eat. For how long will you rely on your father's income, Gullalai Khan? Why don't you setup a business, if you can't share his burden? Your father has advised you to accompany him so many times. For God's sake, don't repeat all that. I've already told you that I don't want be a cleaner or a laborer. Look at you! Your father is in prison and you are always gambling. This is why I tell you to get me married to Zarmina. But no one pays heed to my words. Look at this. It's a special something for you. Let me help you wear it. Give it to me. I'll do it on my own. Why? Why can't I help you wear it? No... Give it to me. It's very pretty. Isn't it? Sir. Yes? Sir... let me drive the truck today. Please give me the keys. I really wish to drive it. Quiet! I thought you were about to say something important. You've spoiled my mood. I never thought you could be a driver. Am I supposed to fly an airplane? I'll drive this truck. Give me a chance. You need to get wiser before you think of driving the vehicle. You've spoiled my mood. Go and take your seat. You are such a fool! -I want to drive the truck. -You don't know how to drive. Come on! -This is not fair. -I'll decide what's fair. Greetings, constable! Where are you coming from and where are you headed to? What are you carrying in the vehicle? Constable! We are carrying a generator towards the border. You need to have dowry to be able to get married. And you need money for that. But we're in a condition... where we don't have enough. Hey, Gullalai! Your father is a successful transporter. Is he unable to find a job for you? What are you saying? Some installments for the truck are yet to be paid. He can plan my wedding once he is free from the anxieties of his silly ventures. He just wants to hurl his difficulties on me by making me the cleaner. Why should your fianc√© bear the brunt? Her elder brother is also very fussy. Isn't he your paternal cousin? That is the issue. On one hand, my father is not cooperative and on the other hand, my to-be brother-in-law wants to get his sister married to someone else. Listen to me, Mother. Uncle Abdullah is a gentleman. But his son Gullalai... is a gambler and a cock-fighter. I will never get my sister married to him. Gullalai is naive. I am confident that Brother Abdullah will get him a job. That's impossible. He has borrowed money from half the bazaar under his father's name and drowned all the money in gambling and cock-fighting. No more arguments. I have decided to clarify it with Uncle Abdullah that it is difficult to let this wedding take place. Shinkai. Yes, master. -Get the vehicle ready in the morning. -Okay. And stop oscillating the vehicle back and forth. You always do that for no good reason. Master, that's not true. Your training has helped me polish my driving skills. You can test my skills. Just give me a chance to drive on the highway. This is what I desire the most in my life. I swear by the Almighty God. I have observed your driving skills. You are deeply mistaken, my dear. You cannot drive. Stop talking and clean the vehicle. Come on. Fool! I am tired of being a cleaner. When will I drive the vehicle? The day isn't far, when I will drive this very vehicle on the highway and I will prove my skills. Where is Gullalai? Where else could he be? He must be sitting with his useless friends. Or he must be engrossed in cock-fighting. May God instill some sense into him. Why don't you talk to him? I am tired of doing that. I have repeatedly told you to take him along with you to work. If it is difficult, then let him have a vehicle on wages. It's not easy to have a vehicle on wages. It is already very hard to pay the installments for this vehicle. Alas! He is such a hapless person! Marriage is not a game. How can we let our sister marry a jobless person? Zarmina is not just your sister, Sher Khan. She is like my daughter. Until Gullalai finds a job and gets settled I won't be proposing the alliance. For how long will this go on? It is not quite desirable to have an unmarried sister at home. It's quite difficult, actually. I cannot wait anymore. You are absolutely right, Sher Khan. I won't hurl you into more complications. Just give me an extension of another month. If Gullalai gets convinced to be a laborer with me on my vehicle then all will be settled. If not, you will be free to take any step. Goodbye. When are you going to stop wandering? When will you reform your ways? What do you expect, Father? I will definitely work when I get a job. You have not even cleared your primary level. And you are dreaming of becoming a collector? Please get into the same profession which was conceived by your father and forefathers. Labor! Please make arrangements for a vehicle on installments. I've spoken with the supervisor of the chief. I need only two lakh rupees initially. I will payoff the debt by earning wages. Two lakh rupees! I haven't even dreamt of such a huge amount! Where will I get that kind of money from? Stop hovering uselessly, my son. Accompany me to work tomorrow onwards. This is impossible, Father. I've already planned a few things with my friends. I will go to Dubai and earn money to buy a vehicle of my own. Dubai! And what about the girl you are seeing? Who will look after her? Sher Khan is in a hurry. Let it be, Father. He is setting me up for failure. Menial tasks like cutting wood and washing pots at the hotel. It is against my grandeur. What? Your grandeur? -What is your grandeur? -Father! Stop it. What is your grandeur? You rascal! Master! What's the matter? Since yesterday, I have been observing... that you are lost in thoughts. Even now when we are going back, you are troubled and anxious. Is everything alright, master? Nothing serious, Shinkai. I had to talk to Sher Khan regarding Gullalai's wedding. He is not going to wait anymore. Master. You're very funny. Gullalai is stupid. He is embarrassed to join his father's occupation. I hope God guides him. Pray for him. God is the most beneficent one. Don't worry. The people of the young generation are very reckless anyway. You are late. I have been waiting for you since so long. I came here with great difficulty. I told them that I'm off to visit Pashmina. It would have been impossible, if Jan Bibi wouldn't have help me. For how long will we meet secretly? Why doesn't your brother give us his consent? Get a job soon. Prove yourself through hard work. You know how my brother is. He will never even think about our wedding amidst such circumstances. What should I do? I cannot do labor. I have thought of purchasing a truck. And when I will go on long routes... I will take you along! Okay, be happy with your daydreaming. Call me when you go on long routes. Get it? It's getting difficult to meet secretly. Brother doesn't allow me. Please don't be upset. I will think of a solution. Leave my hand. Somebody might see us. I am not scared of anyone. Hello, Brother! What are you doing here? Is everything okay? I just felt like meeting Zarmina. You met her last evening and you both were engrossed in talking. And you're here to meet her again? I just felt like meeting her. Listen to me. You rather go elsewhere. Get it? What nonsense! If her brother doesn't want me to live, does that mean I should stop living? You must immediately arrange for dowry and take Zarmina to your house. I'm tired of serving as a messenger. Is it impossible to love without dowry? Please do me a favour. This is... Give this letter to Zarmina. How are you? Forget about me. Today was an awful day because of your brother. He would have killed me for sure. Tell him that I can't meet him anymore. I told him, Zarmina. But you know him. He says he will die if he doesn't meet you. Don't say that! Dare you say that again! I understand, Zarmina. What is it? Zarmina. Let's go. We are getting late. Zarmina! -What's wrong with you? -What happened, Sher Khan? Ask her... Ask this naive girl! What was she doing with that lunatic? Remember this, Mother. She is not allowed to step out of home anymore. No need to study. What are you saying, Sher Khan? Didn't you permit her to study? Gullalai is not a stranger. He is your cousin and her to-be fianc√©. Your father had proposed this alliance at the time of his death. I don't acknowledge that commitment. He is not her fianc√©. It was a mere consideration and their proposal was not fixed, Mother. I can't give my consent to their relationship until Gullalai stops wandering and finds a job. He is a gambler and a cock-fighter. I will never let my sister marry someone like him. Pay attention to these pictures, Abdullah! Will you disagree that these foreigners were not trained terrorists? There is a huge difference between getting trained and practicing terrorism, sir! I have stated what I observed. What are you trying to say? Should we allow these terrorists in our country? And should the police keep arresting them? Okay. Even if I agree that they were the terrorists, there were three women among them, sir. One of them was in the seventh month of pregnancy. And it is strictly objectionable to hurt a woman or a child even in the state of war. We belong to the same religion, Mr. Zaman. Isn't it strange, sir? The court has refused to sign the remand papers of Shinkai and directed us to transfer him to judicial custody. The truck driver has refused to give a statement in our favor. He will give us the statement at any cost! There is a message for you by the ASI and the SHO. Not only will they try to give you a bail, but also recommend the Government to give you a two lakh cash award. Oh, hapless person! Two lakh is not a small amount. Your life will change. You... should think again. I, Abdullah Khan... son of Allahdad Khan and a resident of Kuchlak... hereby solemnly state that I did not know those Tajiks before I met them. I boarded them as passengers from Kuchlak to Quetta. When we got close to Quetta, there was a snap checking initiated by the police. The police stopped the vehicle for a thorough checking, sir. There was a quarrel between them and the police. Meanwhile, a Russian took out a hand grenade. "God is great!" That's the slogan they were shouting out. They ran towards the police station. The police started firing the terrorists. Suddenly, a blast occurred and all the Russians fell down. This is all that I have to state, sir. Okay, Abdullah, you may go now. Mother. Mother. Congratulations, Mother. Father has been released. He will be back home tomorrow. Great news! Thank God! Hats off to you, Abdullah. What a brilliant statement at the tribunal! Congratulations for the acceptance of bail. You are such an opportunist! I could have also made arrangements for your bail, but it would have been without any cash award. This made you manipulate the truth with a lie. Sir, I didn't change my statement for the sake of money. You were right, Abdullah. "The poor man has only one craving." "Money." "And just, money." But it's unbelievable that you betrayed your faith and beliefs for the sake of money. What a brilliant statement at the tribunal! This amount will help you pay off the debts and the installments of your truck. You can now prepare for the dowry of your son. Abdullah! Please clarify before you go. Which of your statements is based on the truth? Is it the one that you iterated to me? Or the one recorded in front of the tribunal? Abdullah Khan. Why do you look so troubled? Gratitude to God, every trouble has been wiped out. Shinkai was telling me that the government is awarding you a huge amount of money for denouncing the terrorists. I will renovate the entire house, arrange for Gullalai's dowry and prepare for his wedding without any worries. I will fulfill all the desires of my children. Don't be a miser. Why aren't you listening to me? Okay, as you wish. Is there a problem? There is no problem. What's the matter? It's nothing serious. Please go to bed. Abdullah Khan. The call for worship has been announced. Let's go and offer our prayers. You may proceed. I will be joining you shortly. Abdullah Khan. You spend so much time bowing to the laymen. Instead, surrender yourself to the will of Allah and your life will change. Hurry up, now. I don't want my brother to catch us. Don't worry about that. My father is soon going to get a huge amount of money and all our troubles will be solved. Tell your mother to start preparing for our wedding. Are you serious? How can I tell that to my mother? You must ask your father to do that. Brother is already annoyed with me. He won't wait anymore! Once we get married, I will teach your brother a lesson. Just stop! Not a word against my brother. Then whom should I blame? You? No. Blame Gullalai! Oh, my beloved! Master, stop worrying. Render gratitude to God for our lives have been saved. And most importantly, we will be rewarded! -What else do you wish for? -This is all a lie! If not yourself, please have mercy on me at least. I don't want to be imprisoned and get tortured once again. Stop being obsessed about the truth, master! Shinkai Khan... I'm helpless! I can't sleep at night. Their faces keep hovering in front of me. What was bound to happen has happened, master. If you change your statement, you will be imprisoned for a lifetime. Pay heed to my words and please bury this matter now. And this is the truth that they let the terrorists in, without any visa permit. Please forget this issue and start preparing for Gullalai's wedding. Forget it. Please stop thinking about it. Take a look at this, Mother. I know. Keep it here. Mother! You are always grooming yourself. I know how handsome you are. Let me check, Mother. You look into the mirror time and again. You have nothing else to do. Look. Your father is here. Father, she has shopped on credit. What is all this? From where did you get this? Return it right now. Who will pay for all this? No way! Why should I return it? It is obvious. You will pay for it, Abdullah Khan. These are merely some clothes for me and my children. The jewelry is yet to be bought and this house needs to be renovated. But, not now. We can do that after we get your cash award! My God! Why don't you understand? It is not some award. It is a curse in disguise! It is a curse indeed. This reward has tormented my peace and comfort. Oh God! I'm tired of him. Abdullah Khan. What happened? Why do you look worried? My fate has entangled me in a misery. What else could be more entangling than life itself? Well... how grave is this perjury in our religion? Perjury is a huge sin. Allah has cursed upon the liars. And, did you know... on the day of judgment, he will be resurrected amongst the liars. Even if the accused perjury is proven truthful by some other party? Let the truth of others be confined to them, Abdullah Khan! Your truth is merely that which you have witnessed. Man should be a witnesser to those incidents for which he is an absolute eyewitness. Because sometimes truth turns out to be a huge expiation. Expiation? Isn't expiation a huge sin? In our religion, every sin is liable to be forgiven except practicing idolatry. But before you receive forgiveness you need to repent for it. Repent for the sins and you will be forgiven. It is also worth considering that if the sin is pertinent to human rights then the prime forgiveness is from the sufferer. God will shower His salvation, if it is His will. But remember this, Abdullah Khan... the path of truth is very strenuous, but the destiny is very peaceful. Sher Khan, listen to Khan Bibi. Listen to me. I have no personal enmity with you. I don't want anything for myself. I want you to guarantee my sister's good future. When Gullalai will buy a truck on installments I will bid farewell to Zarmina on that day. I can understand your worry, Sher Khan! Every brother in this world is worried for his sister. But, give me some more time. I will try to convince Gullalai's father. I will spend all the money received as cash award on Gullalai and Zarmina's wedding. I have already been very patient. What else do you expect? Okay. I am giving Gullalai two weeks to prepare. If he manages the matrimonial requisites within fifteen days, then it will be good. Otherwise, I will have Zarmina married to the headmaster Fazal Mohammad's son. His son is a teacher at the school. And this is my final decision! Listen up, Abdullah Khan! You haven't given me a single moment of happiness in my life. I never complained. And now when we are being blessed with hope why do you want to destroy everything? For God's sake, don't hurl this injustice upon us. Otherwise, I won't be able to celebrate my son's happiness. Forget it, Mother. Father is not concerned about our happiness. If we are left to his mercy, he will detain us out of his helplessness. He is actually jealous of our happiness. What are you saying! Why will a father be jealous of his son's happiness? Then, why do you want to let go of the cash award? Nothing will change if you go ahead and change your statement. Everybody is wise enough. One useless truth will hurl our family into a state of suffering. My son, truth is never useless. Truth is like a debt that keeps pinching the conscience throughout life. It keeps chasing the human mind until one dies. Fine! Before changing your statement, you must give us some poison and bury us in the graveyard. Shut up! Father! What are you saying? I will die. It's true, Gullalai! My brother has fixed my alliance with the headmaster's son. I shall be married to him in the next week. No! That's impossible. I will not let you marry someone else. I will plead in front of your brother. I will beg for you. -I will... -You have wasted a lot of time, Gullalai. Instead of being dreamy about setting up a business, if you would have worked hard then my brother's trust would not have flickered. Now, you can't do what my brother expects you to do. You can never do it. Zarmina! Your brother cannot decide our fate. Let's elope! No, Gullalai! We have loved each other. Don't make it a crime. Everybody tried to convince me about the fact that you are lazy. That I should forget about you. But I loved you. I have only loved you. But we are not destined to be together. I am not just the love of your life. I am also the honor of a brother and the reverence of an old mother. I have complete faith in you. I am sure you will not sabotage my brother's honor and keep up the respect that my old mother holds. This was our last meeting. Take care of yourself... and forget me. Zarmina! Zarmina! O God! Gullalai. Zarmina has returned your gifts. Hello, sir. You are very late, Abdullah. Tomorrow is the burial of those Tajiks and you are here to say that you want to change your statement. Do you know what will happen? I know, sir. Probably, a life imprisonment. But, sir. Imprisonment is better than a tainted conscience! You will not only lose the cash but also risk the jobs of many policemen. Do you want to invite a lifetime of enmity with the policemen? It is much better than self-enmity, sir. And I didn't change the statement for the sake of money. Sir, you told me that we are going to court. Why have you brought me to prison? You're here, Shinkai! Don't beat me! -For God's sake, don't beat me! -Speak up! Hey! How brutal! May God bring misery upon you. Why have you beaten this innocent? You are responsible for his predicament, Abdullah Khan. Me? What! Why am I responsible? Yes! You and your obstinacy has cast this misery upon him. My obstinacy? Indeed, it is your obstinacy. Why are you reluctant to record this statement that those Tajiks advanced towards the police station for terrorist purposes? And that they were shouting the slogan "God is great." -But, sir! -No arguments! Even the government has accepted them as terrorists and we are receiving a huge reward for their encounter. So what is the problem with you? Sir. Okay... as you wish. Be imprisoned with pain and misery. Don't complaint if you and your friends are executed to death. Let's go, Pervaiz. I think the prison is their fate. Sir. Okay, sir. I will say whatever you want me to say. But please release this innocent friend of mine. Sir. Sir, I cannot live with this burden anymore. Please have some mercy on me. Okay, Abdullah. I will make arrangements for recording your statement in front of the tribunal. You will be presented in front of the tribunal tomorrow. Abdullah, so you say that your previous statement was backed by police pressure. Is the pressure not persistent now? No, sir. I am merely under the pressure of conscience and faith and there is no compulsion anymore. Okay, Abdullah Khan, you may proceed with your statement. I want to say that those Russians were mere passengers. Stop the vehicle, master. There is a lavish income standing by the road. Shut up! We don't know them. Please stop the vehicle, master. I'll talk to them. Stop! Hello! How are you? Where are you going? -Kuwait! -I'm going to Quetta not Kuwait. I don't understand what you are saying. Listen to me. -Oh good, you know Pashto. -We are going to Quetta. I see. You are going to Quetta. -How much money will you charge? -Let's settle on ten thousand. No, I will pay you five thousand. Do you have a passport or a visa? No, we don't. Five thousand is too less. Shinkai! Come here. Yes. Master, these people are headed to Quetta. They are ready to pay 5000 rupees. What do you say? Oh, so you have settled the amount? Are you trying to dictate me? So, you've sealed the deal? Who are they? Where are they going? Do you know them? You are such a fool. Don't you know what a risk this is? Master, we've got nothing to do with who they are where they're going, or their purpose. We should only be concerned about the 5000 rupees. If we don't take them along, someone else will. Shall I call them now? Do they have a visa? Why would they pay 5000 rupees for such a short distance, if they had a visa? They don't have a visa. We can't take them along. You are stupid. You're calling for trouble. Come on. Just get in! Master, they are good people. And most importantly, they are Muslims. If we don't take them along for 5000 rupees, someone else will. 30 kilometers is all we need to deal with. What about the police station on the way? Who will be responsible to handle the police? Master, you are a coward. They will handle the police and give the money as well. Don't over-think. Who are these five people? One is a Russian, and the rest of them are Tajiks. Where have they come from? Why are they going to Quetta? They've come from across the border. They're headed to Iran via Quetta for a pilgrimage. How do you know all this? Do you know their language? My father used to speak Russian. They know a bit of Pashto. They've explained everything to me. How are they related to each other? One of them is a couple. The others are all relatives, master. Let's forget it. Make them board the truck. Otherwise, someone else would grab the amount. -Okay, make them sit. Hurry up! -Yes! Hurry up! There we go. Okay. I've settled the issue with great difficulty. Board the vehicle. -We settled at five thousand. -That's right. You are behaving as if you've paid me 5000 dollars. Come on. You can sit with me on the front seat. Thank you too. Come on. One after the other. Yes. There you go! Wolga, are you tired? Yes, I am quite tired. Don't worry. We are near the city now. There, you will get complete rest. Greetings, sir. -How are you, sir? -All well. Greetings to you. -Take a seat. -Yes. Sure. -There you go. -This is for you. Is everything okay? Can we have some tea? Oh, yes. Listen to me, carefully. Okay, listen. We are at a hotel. The tea is ready. Join us. Sisters, wait here. The men may join us. Sure. Stay here. We will be back after having tea. Come on. Sisters, tea for you. Madam, it's tea. Please have it. Please give me my tea. We need to leave soon. Hey! Listen! What are you doing? What's happening? There you go. -Please keep this money. -It's okay. Let it be. -Please keep this money. -It's okay. -Please keep it. -It's okay. Please take it. Keep your money inside. Why are you fighting? Please pay. Why do you want to pay? I'll give him the money. You are our guest. Keep your money aside. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. -Wait a minute. -Hurry up! Come on! See you soon. Goodbye. -Greetings, Brother. -Greetings. How are you? Check the vehicle. How are you doing, Brother? Hope you're doing good. Open it and stay away. See. Everything is okay. Where are you taking these passengers? Going to Quetta, sir. I am not asking about you. I am inquiring about those people sitting at the back. Sir, they are travelers and were standing by the road. We are just taking them to Quetta. There is nothing more to it, I swear! Oh, such a sympathetic man! Get them out of the vehicle. -Wait a minute, sir! -Stay quiet. Listen to me. Sir, please listen to us. Sir, wait a minute. Listen to me, please. The matter is... Come with me. Wait a minute, master. Brother, come. Okay, sir. Everything is alright now. Why are you staring at me, sir? This is such a huge amount. They are poor. They are headed to Iran on a pilgrimage. They will pray for you and for us. All of us will be blessed. You've got money and now you'll get blessings too, by the grace of God. If you're destined to get it. Okay. Let's go, master. Let's move forward. Okay, I will accompany you. I have some work in the city. Okay. Come and sit on the front seat. No. I will sit at the back. You can sit here. -Want to sit here? Okay. -Yes. Sit quickly. Make it fast. Sit down. Quick... Come on in. Hey! What are you doing? Don't beat me. Stop! Don't beat me. Stop it! Don't beat me. -Don't beat me... -Brother? What happened, Brother? Why are you angry? What happened, Brother? Watch out. Inspector, what's wrong with you? Hey, Brother. Why are you running? Hey, Brother. Don't run away. Where are you going? Listen to me. Don't run away. Stop! Listen to me. Brother! Sister! I had arrested five terrorists and I was bringing them to prison... but they disembarked the vehicle threatening me with a hand grenade. Inform all the police mobiles that they are heading towards Kharotabad police station with an intention of a suicide attack. Roger control! I am informing them. That's the check-post. Look. Right there! Let's go. Don't fire! Hey, you! Hey, you. Stop! No! Stop! What are you doing? Please stop this. Oh God! Sir, it's surprising. The person whom you used to reckon as a criminal, some days ago... has totally changed your views about him. What will we tell the media, sir? We will present the truth to the media, Mirza. The entire nation should not be guilty for the crimes of a few individuals. It should be reverberated in the whole world that the active police force brought the realities into the limelight. At the time of death those five foreigners were without weapons. What are you saying? Let me remind you that a detonator and safety pins were found from the belongings of those foreigners. And I am really surprised that you are talking in favor of that driver. You... are someone who strived hard to elicit the truth from him, at any cost in order to wipe out the blemish on the stature of the country and the nation. Indeed, sir. I am still willing to do the same. I shall communicate the truth to the whole nation and the world. And, what is the truth according to you? It is indeed unfortunate, sir. Those foreigners had no weapons and they could have been easily arrested alive. If the police had doubts that they had bombs on their bodies, it would have been easily detected through scanners when they were injured. They should have been taken to the hospital, sir. Their lives would have been saved. We were facilitated by the equipment which could have easily scanned their injured bodies from a specific distance, sir! Think carefully, officer. The truth that you are advocating could risk multiple lives. Even the CM has announced a huge reward for the police department. How would we face them? Truth is truth indeed, sir. It doesn't require any justification. Our answers should be based on truth alone. Everything is ready, master. Shinkai. Yes, master. Take the keys. Are you serious, master? You are the driver, today onwards, throughout the route. Really? What are you saying? I can't believe this! Are you kidding me, master? -Take the seat! -As you say, master. -Wow! -I'll be the cleaner now. No, Father. Now onwards, I am the cleaner. Gullalai! My son! Go, my dear. Starting today, you are the cleaner of the vehicle. Do as I say. Sure, Father. I'll take your leave. Take care. Come on, master.
