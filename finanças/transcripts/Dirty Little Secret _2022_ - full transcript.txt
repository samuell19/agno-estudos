[♪♪] Okay, we're on the same page, right? Nothing crazy for my birthday. Just the Chinese food and television. Yes, mom, I heard you the first several times. Okay, I'm just checking. Have a good day. [♪♪] [Lucy] The thing about a secret is, you could lose it. It could stop being a secret and become common knowledge. The more people you get close to, the more likely that is to happen. Hmph. Look at them. Cheerleaders and athletes... Guys in bands. Could they be more predictable? They have no secrets. Maybe they did once, but how can you keep something private when people are watching every move you make? You blend in. Be invisible. Have one friend. [♪♪] [Teacher] Take your seats. We're talking about the great depression. What time do you have to be there? As soon as my mom's shift ends. Nadine has the whole surprise party set up like it's some invasion of a small country. [Teacher] Lucy, unless you and Kaylie are discussing the impact of the wpa on the great depression, I suggest you let it go. Okay... We are entering the end-of-term presentation time, which means three things. First, rather than pick a topic everyone has heard before, I want you to choose an area in history you think your classmates do not know a lot about. Yes, that will require some research. This is a two-person presentation. Everyone will have a partner. And third, you'll be presenting in character, which is to say as a person from the past who knows the subject you're talking about. We could do Alexander Hamilton and Aaron burr. I could kill you in a duel. Yeah, because nobody saw that musical. Okay, pairs. Emily will work with Robin. Josh... I'll put you with Lucy, and Kaylie will be with Jessica. Lisa... Um, Mr. Duran, could I please work with Kaylie, if that's okay? It's not okay. I don't want people sticking with friends they always speak to. Let's get some cross-pollination. Yes, but I don't... I don't always talk with Kaylie. "Because no one saw that musical." [Class laughing] Out of that comfort zone, Tompkins. Bryce and Israel, Amelia and Jake, Tate, Emma. Okay, now please open your textbooks to chapter two. Josh told his friends on Snapchat that he's going to be working with "the shy girl." Great. So he still hasn't retained my name. Hey, at least your partner doesn't call you Haylie. I mean, how hard is it to say Kaylie with a "k"? What do you think? I love it. Why do you use the gym showers? It's just easier to get to the hospital from here. Yeah, tonight, but I've seen you come out of this place a lot of mornings. Wouldn't it just be simpler to do it at home? I wake up at the last minute, and my mom can't wait for me, and then I have to get ready here. Why the interest? I just wondered. Whoa, Lucy. Looking good. -Thank you. -Check this. Nice! I called some of your mom's ex-patients, and some of the staff are going to stop by as they get time. Yeah, and you put them to work. You are so efficient, it is scary. You should be in Washington. Hey, where's mom? Luckily, she's still in with a patient, -so... -Okay. [Man] It's starting to quiet down. That's because we changed the medication in your iv. Oh. I'm sorry. I know I'm supposed to tell the doctors everything when I come in, so you can watch out for interactions. It's okay. I couldn't remember. I can never remember them all. We didn't need a list, did we? We figured it out. You looked at your palm, and you remembered how many pills you take in the morning and what color they are. It was all there, in your memory. Nothing's ever really lost. We keep it all... Somewhere. Need a hand? Oh. No, I'm good. Thank you. This is the cardiac care unit, and you're not wearing a uniform. Oh, I don't work here. I'm the daughter. Lucy. Oh. Drew Armitage. -So were you a patient? -I was. Doctors put a pacemaker in me. Then I got sick, so they put another one in. Then I got sick, so they put in another. Is that something that they can just keep doing? No. But someone finally figured out that I was just allergic to the titanium parts in the pacemakers. So now this thing in my heart? Solid-gold components. Wow. Well... I'm glad that you're okay. Me too. So, when Nadine called, asking if I wanted to celebrate the birthday of the woman that figured that little thing out... Your mother is damn smart. What's going on? Happy birthday! -It was all her. -Damn right. What are you going to do, walk away from red velvet cake? [Applause] Mom, did you really diagnose something that a bunch of other doctors missed? Yes, but it's not because I had to Sherlock Holmes it, it's because I listened to the patient. Okay, well, pacemaker guy was spending a lot of time talking to you. His name is drew. Well... You did save drew's life, so maybe he wants to marry you. Maybe he wanted to be nice to one of his nurses. Ooh, it's cold in here, mom. Do you think you could turn on the heater? Mm-hmm. Why do you always ask for forks and knives when we order Asian? Oh, I'm a klutz with chopsticks. You know, all my nurse's training goes out the window as soon as I start to eat. Okay, well, I'm going to go grab some, then. Okay. [♪♪] [Cell phone buzzes] [♪♪] It is definitely too late for a movie. Do you want to watch home renovation or cooking? Ooh, definitely home renovation. Okay. Nice. Can you pass me those? Thanks. Okay. [TV playing] You are joining me for potstickers, right? Yes, but then I have to go study some history, because if I don't, who knows what stupid idea my partner might come up with. Here you go, mom. Oh. Happy birthday, mom. [♪♪] [Flushing] [Clattering] -Hey, mom. -Hi. I wanted to create some space in the living room and dig out the sewing machine for some drapes I was thinking about making. You don't mind if I keep this in here temporarily? Uh, do we even have a sewing machine anymore? I haven't seen it since I was a kid. Of course we do, and it's high time we unearthed it. We don't have space in the living room, mom. Well, we won't if you don't help me. Okay. Well, good night. I'm going to watch a little TV. [♪♪] [TV plays faintly] [♪♪] They're just... They're something that I do for myself. I mean, I was hoping that maybe one day I could do... I know nothing about how fashion works... ...but even I can tell these are good. Are you serious about a career? Yes. Then I say aim high. You can't do better than F.I.T., the fashion institute of technology. They must get a lot of applicants. And there's no reason you can't be one of them. I'm not sure. It's not high-risk. All you'd be out is the application fee. They're in New York, right? I wasn't really planning on going away for college. Is it the expense? There are grants you can apply for. They might not pay for everything, but they'd certainly help. I don't know. I don't think so. Are you going to give up without even trying? Aren't you curious if you'd get in? Honestly? Yeah. Let's print up some application forms. [Lucy] Sara, come on. [Lucy] Sara! Finally. Did anything happen to mom? No, no. I just need you to pay attention. To what? Well, the school counselor wants me to apply to F.I.T. Well, put her off. She can't make you do it. You can't possibly be considering it. No... Not really. Um, so, Sara, how did you and Phil keep people from coming by the house? I mean, aside from the usual excuse. What's your usual? "My mom doesn't like me having people over when she's at work." Well, what's wrong with that? It's a classic. What do you tell Kaylie? Nothing. She already knows something's up. Did you say anything to her? No, are you kidding? I haven't let anyone inside since I was eight and Janet Bester ran in to use the bathroom, and I got called "garbage girl" for the next two years. Lu, you have to be careful. Seriously. Do you want child protective services to get involved? Because then we lose all control of the situation, and anything can happen. The best thing to do is just to keep your distance from people, okay? Then the problem doesn't arise. Does it get better? It'll be fine. Look, I have to run, but I'll come see mom this weekend, okay? Bye. [♪♪] Are those for... They're for everyone on this floor... With my thanks. How nice of you. Thank you. I was hoping to talk to you for a minute. Sure. What about? I was thinking... About the night I was in that room. I was sure I wasn't going to make it, not through another failed surgery. And you must've spent half the night with me. I mean, you'd get calls, but you always came back. I never met anyone so easy to talk to. Thank you, but you know, I didn't do anything special. I mean, if you hadn't told me about your other allergies... I'm not talking about that. Okay... You saved my life... ...and I am grateful. The whole surgical team also saved my life, and I feel no impulse to date them. Would it be crazy to think you might like to have dinner with me? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. It wouldn't be crazy. I'm just... Seeing someone? Busy. Usually here. Even the greatest nurses in the world need to eat some time. Yes? Maybe Friday? -Okay. -Okay. I'll pick you up at your place. Let's meet at the restaurant. Just text me the address. All right. Yeah. [School bell rings] Books to page 35, please. We're going to be discussing where the great depression started, what year it started, -and what year it ended. -[Text alert buzzes] Okay? Now, does anyone know what ended the great depression? -Anyone? Anyone? -[Text alert buzzes] Anyone? Okay. It's right there in the text. I want you to make sure, because in your projects, these are things I want you to cover. I want you to cover the year that it started, the year that it ended, what companies were most affected by it. Um... What was the global impact of the great depression? -[Text alert buzzes] -Okay. Well, if you look down into your textbooks, you'll see that the words are right there. It's been a long day, everyone, I know, but please wake up. Sorry. [Teacher] Who can tell me what the new deal is? Emily? Nothing? We are already working so well together. [Teacher] All right... [Woman host on TV] Just look at the timeless elegance of this mid-century-modern living room, featuring brass tables... [Mom] You know, I've been thinking. Maybe it's time to fix this place up. Like, uh, how? We've watched so many home-Reno shows. I mean, some of them done on a shoestring budget. We... we're practically professionals. Yeah, we are. Yeah, I say we make some space and, you know, use our creativity. Okay, um... Where were you thinking of making that space? Living room. Yeah, let's start going through the boxes and confirm what's in them, and then, you know, and then we can get rid of what we don't need. Yeah, okay. Okay... Mom! Dishware. I've never seen this set before. Oh, we can't throw that away. You know, this is what we're going to use when we throw parties here after we fix this place up. Okay, so... It belongs in the kitchen, then. Yeah, but no room in the kitchen. You know what? Let's just leave it here for right now. Hmm. Ah. Old essays and test papers. You're not seriously suggesting I get rid of... Look at that. -What? -That mid-century chair. Gorgeous. Okay, I think we should base the entire living-room design on that chair. Um... You know, let me see if I can find it in one of these catalogues. Yes, yes... These. I'm sure you don't want these anymore, right? Honey, you know how cold it gets in here. Have you seen a blue box? Blue box, blue box... Oh, I actually remember seeing one back here. Okay, yeah. This one? Yes. So I've been saving some ideas. Look. Look, honey. Wouldn't that be great? It's so clean. Pretty, right, airy. I always told you, honey, it's messy right now, but it's just temporary. See, look. What I'm going to do is I'm going to find the chair that we want. I know I saw it in one of these last week, and I'm going to cut it out, I'm going to put it in here, and it'll remind me of what we're looking for. Okay? Oh, can you get my scissors? Where are they? I don't know. You were the last one to have them. The ones with the black handles. I don't think I did. Not recently. -I don't think so. - Yes. Yes, I remember. You were standing right here, and you wanted to cut the tag off your backpack. Mom, I haven't had that backpack in a year, and I've seen you with those scissors a few times. Lucy, you always borrow my stuff and you never put it back where it belongs, and then you shift the blame to me! Mom, I swear, I didn't take them. You know, I work 12 hours a day, and then I come home and take care of you, and nothing is where I left it! Nothing is where I left it. You know, I work, and I clean, and you don't care! I have tried. I have tried, all right? God! But I can't live like this. No one should have to. It's not normal! Well, I'm sorry I don't want to live in a pigsty! Clearly, I'm the strange one. If you don't like it, why don't you just leave? You are crazy! And you're making everyone else crazy! Then leave! Don't you walk out on us! [Door slams] Well, where did you last see the scissors? I don't know. You had them last. Maybe they're... In here in the desk. Here they are. These aren't mine. I want the ones with the black handles! You know, this is why we can never get anything done in this house. I can't live like this! Have a seat. Okay, what have we got? Oh, so far, nothing. I mean, with all of America's history to choose from, I was expecting this to be easier. Want to hear my idea? It's not some famous couple, is it? I don't want to be George and Martha Washington, or... It's not a couple at all. I also don't want to be some super-famous person that everybody's tired of. Hear me out. What do you think about this? John Muir and Mary colter. Never heard of them. Did you not just say a minute ago... Okay, okay. All right. Who are they? Have you ever been to Yosemite? Oh, you should go. It's amazing. You don't have to bring anything but food. Live minimally. It sounds like heaven. It is. The mountains all around... My family stayed in a cabin on this... On a valley floor. John Muir was known as the father of our national parks. He was one of the first people to speak out about preserving our wilderness. He lived in Yosemite for years and defended it from development. Okay... And Mary colter... Oh! She's an architect. When women weren't architects. She designed buildings in national parks... Places that were in Harmony with environments around them... Using indigenous art. What do you think? You seem to know an awful lot about this. Well, it's what I want to do... Create buildings that are beautiful and aren't energy-sucking vampires. Hmm. Of course, I also want to be the most famous bass player in the world, so there's that. [Lucy] Oh, okay. So she was designing a hotel in the Grand Canyon in the 1930s. I can make an outfit with vintage design. We're going to be dressing up? Oh, we are most definitely going to be dressing up. Man, you are not shy at all, are you? Your house next time? My mom doesn't like me having people over when she's at work, so... That's okay. I have soccer practice tomorrow, so I wouldn't be able to meet till the evening anyway. [Lucy] I think mom's getting worse. Thanks. Thank you. What did happen when dad left? I was thinking about that night. You... You were so little. I didn't think you remembered. Am I crazy, or was the house different back then? Everything was different. "Take your shoes off at the door. Line them up evenly." "Vacuum the rug... In straight lines only." "Is that dust underneath your bed, Phil?" Dad couldn't take it anymore. [Sara] She changed when he left. We didn't know if she was going to come out of it, but it seemed like a good sign when she started taking interest in things. Yeah, she was buying new cookware, and... It's like she went from the south pole of ocd to the north pole of ocd. [Phil] You remember when mom was in the hospital for a couple weeks? After that car accident? Oh, my... [Phil] Aunt Jean came to take care of us. Sweeties, what happened? [Phil] The corolla got rear-ended. I mean the house. How long has it been like this? A while. What do people say when they come over? No one comes over. Aunt Jean! Hi, honey. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. I thought... It's all right. Your mom has been through a lot. You all have. She's been trying hard to keep things together for you, and we have to help her by cleaning this place up. Okay... What if we changed the house? What if we got in a cleaning crew when she was away at work one day, or... No, no, no. No, no, no, no. No. Where is it? Where is everything? [Jean] Everything important is here. We just straightened up a little. But... But my... My papers, my photos, my files, my magazines... Some of that stuff was irreplaceable! I swear, Jo, we kept everything that was valuable. It's all put away. You should be proud. The kids did such a great job. You... You made the kids do this to me? Jo. Jo, Jo... Jo, no! Jo, it's... [Shattering] Jo, Jo... Sara, honey... Could you grab a dustpan? You will do no such thing. Aunt Jean said you'd like it! [Jean] For god's sake, Jo! Wake up! Don't you remember what it was like with mama when we were kids? Can't you see you're living just like her? I am nothing like her! Everything in this house has a purpose and a meaning. How dare you come into my home and get rid of my treasures! Treasures? Dirty old blankets? Broken appliances? Are those your treasures? Get out! Jo, think! What if Sara and Phil's friends found out? I remember what it was like when we were kids, even if you don't. Get out of the house! Go! I never want to talk to you. Don't ever talk to my children again! Fine. You're on your own. I can't help you if you love your garbage more than you love your kids. My treasures... All the things I kept safe. [Sara] She shouldn't have encouraged us. Learn from experience. There's nothing you can do about mom. So I should just write her off? No. You guys freaked her out. Aunt Jean went too far. What if I just... Worked around the edges? It's pretty clear that mom doesn't know where everything is. If I just took a couple of bags from the living room, would she even notice? What's good is a couple of bags going to do? And then, every few days, a couple more. Eventually, she'll notice, lu. But then maybe she'll see that it didn't hurt so much. I'm not planning on flipping her life upside down. I'll go slow. I'll be stealthy. I don't know, lu. You guys left me there all alone. I want to help mom. I didn't guess how bad it would be after I lost Jane. It may sound stupid, if a spouse dies, you expect to be devastated, and I was, but it went deeper. For a while there, I barely knew who I was. It was like part of me just wasn't in the world anymore. I know what you're saying. I'm not going to compare a divorce to what you went through, but... ...but the person you were, you can't be that person any longer. You look the same, you talk the same, people don't know. How did you cope? Was it just time? Time helps. And one day I decided, well, if I'm going to be a different person, maybe I should have a different routine, as opposed to doing the same thing for the next 40 years, just without the woman I loved. Is this one of those things where you buy a fine German-made sports car and want to own a vineyard? I think that's a whole other level of transformation. No, no, I... For 20 years, I had a toasted bagel every morning. I loved my toasted bagel. With cream cheese? Well, of course. One day, I thought, I wonder what I'm capable of when it comes to breakfast. I taught myself to make a full Japanese-style meal. Rice, miso soup with wakame seaweed, tamagoyaki eggs... You learned to cook. [Laughs] I wanted to learn if I could do it, but more important, I wanted to learn if I would like something so different. If I was capable of change. And? I'm telling you, Joanna, never say no to tamagoyaki eggs. [Cell phone buzzing] Hey. I asked my mom if we had a sewing machine, and she said there was a portable one in the closet. Does that work for us? Oh yeah, yeah. No, that's great. I've only ever used the one at school, which is a piece of crap, so... Um, look, we'll be meeting at your place, though, right? You know, just because there's no point in lugging that thing back and forth. Makes sense. Hey, I hear we're not the only ones doing costumes. They won't be as good as ours. It's nice one of us has confidence. Bubble wrap. What about it? I am going to throw it out. Live it up! I'll see you tomorrow. She won't notice, you guys. I feel like I could have done better with Phil and Sara. You know, they had to hear all the fights. It's not surprising they don't want to come visit more. They must hate that house and those memories... ...but, hopefully, I've redeemed myself a little with Lucy. You know, I tried to protect her from anything like that... ...to keep her safe and secure... ...but I'm afraid I've built a wall around us both. A big wall? Great wall of China big, yeah. Well, hopefully, I could knock on the gate from time to time. This is me. [Car door unlock chirps] Well, if I couldn't see you to your house, at least I could see you to your car. I was taught to always make sure the door closes safely behind the girl you're with. Stop me if this is a mistake. Good night. [Car engine starts] [Doorbell rings] There's a third one in the can. You can get that. You went through the trash? The cans were out of alignment. They weren't like that when I left, so I wanted to see what was going on. Wow, mom, you really are a detective. What the hell were you thinking? You said that you wanted to clean out the place a couple days ago. Oh, so you decided unilaterally what things of mine you could get rid of? It's bubble wrap. Yeah, for sending packages, gifts. What if I want to send something to Phil or Sara? We could buy more. You have no idea what anything costs. Yeah, some people in this world are okay tossing away 20 or $30. We are not those people. We have to be careful. We always have to be careful. Mom, you shouldn't get upset, okay? Your asthma's bad enough without stress. [Wheezing] I'm fine. See? I can handle an argument, baby girl. Okay? I see worse than this at the hospital every day. [Text alert chimes] Is that pacemaker guy? I guess you guys had a nice night. It was pretty good... Till a few minutes ago. I'm sorry. We already have two bags of this stuff now. Do I really have to go out and get the last one? [Mom] Nice house. Well, you're quiet today. I was thinking about college. Oh? I want to study art and fashion, and the school counselor thinks that I might be able to get into F.I.T. in New York, and there are other good schools. Those places cost a lot of money. Yeah, but there are grants and scholarships that I can apply for, and internships. I won't know until I try. That sounds so great, honey, but remember we talked about all the hidden expenses they get you with? Community college is really your best first step. I could get a part-time job on campus. You wouldn't have to pay for anything. Well, we don't have to settle it today. Yeah, right. It's just, um, the thing is, I'm a senior, and it's getting late in the process for applying, and, mom, if I don't commit soon... Jeez, Lucy! I just got done with a long shift. Can you give me a little time to think before you start badgering me? Baby, you are 17. You have your entire life to live out on your own. Are you really in that much of a hurry to leave me? No, that's not it. You're my sweet baby girl. I'm just not ready to let you go yet. My god, I can't believe that I've never heard of Mary colter. I mean, did you see the place that she designed on the floor of the Grand Canyon? You know, when she showed the park service her drawings, they loved everything but the name. They wanted to name the building something like "Roosevelt's chalet," so she picked up her blueprints, and she said, "not if you are using my work." And today it's called... The phantom ranch. I mean, could the name be any cooler? You did not want to screw with this woman. Make the ranch your next vacation. Uh, we don't travel much. Oh, I forgot to ask. So many people have peanut allergies. I shouldn't have assumed. Oh, not me, Mrs. Lee. -I love peanut butter. -I think we're good. Let me know if you need anything. I have a conference call at 5. Other than that, I'm around. Is the sewing machine working out? It's great. Thanks. Sorry... She's a little hover-y. She's nice. Yeah, she is nice... Now. Now? She's making up for stuff. Mom's an alcoholic. Things were bad here for a while. I thought your life was perfect. On the outside. She only ever drank at home. My dad, my sister... We were the only ones who saw the truth. And you're okay with talking about it? She's upfront about the situation. Says it's not a secret. And my therapist said that we have to... You're in therapy? Sometimes, it helps to talk. You know, my therapist said that you can't carry someone else's burden. What are you thinking so hard about? Just not feeling responsible. It must feel... Free. Okay, so... Which one of us should go first when it is showtime? -Not me. -Not me. [Laughs] [School bell rings] Lucy, good to see you. Have you thought any more about school applications? Um, yeah, but before we talk about that, I sort of had a question. Oh. You're, like, a counselor, right? Which is sort of like a therapist? It's "like," but it's not the same thing. I can recommend a therapist. No. All right. Can people change? How do you mean? My friend, he said his mother's an alcoholic, and when she drank, bad things happened. Your mother is who she is, and you can try and change her, but... It doesn't always work, you know, and some people, they can pull it off. How? And why is it so difficult? It seems so simple, doesn't it? Why can't the person just stop doing the thing that causes everyone so much pain? Yes. Why can't they? It seems easy from the outside because it would be easy for us. From the inside, it's totally different. It's a major undertaking. It's scary. But there must be something that the person near them could do to help. There may not be. But there is something you can do for yourself. We talked about a therapist earlier... No, no, you know, I just came here to ask a question about a friend because I was curious. I actually think that I'm late for class. Okay, but if you want to talk, I'm here to help... No, no. There's nothing to talk about. Thank you, though, for your time. Call the department of children and family services. Almost time. You sure you don't want to come in with me? And just stand there like a lump while you're talking? Not happening. [Applause] You really want to make an entrance, don't you? Oh, yeah. Next up, Josh. Good luck. Here I go. Hi. I'm John Muir. How many people have heard of me? How many people have been to Yosemite? Well, I'm the guy you should be thanking. Thank you. [Applause] Here's Mary colter. [♪♪] ♪ So I'm gonna live my life ♪ ♪ spending every day knowing what I like... ♪ You may address me as miss colter. I am one of the few female architects in my day. ♪ Don't care if it's rain or shine ♪ ♪ I'm alive ♪ ♪ I feel like I'm in paradise ♪ [School bell rings] Did you see his face? Oh, my god, they clapped. They clapped for us. They did. They did! Applause, Josh. No one's applauded me before. I'm just going to say it. I love us. God, I wish I could pretend to be her all the time. You know, be sure of myself like she was. Maybe someday. Lucy, don't you get it? You're like that now. Lucy. Lucy... I wanted to talk a little. I have time later. You want to come by my office? I'm pretty busy, and I have to get ready for class. I'd like to convince you to give me a chance. A chance to do what? Okay, you don't have to talk. I will. You're a bright young woman. You get good grades, you stay out of the spotlight. There's nothing wrong with that, but it won't save you. You're 17 years old. Your problems should be simple. You shouldn't have to worry about whether something you do or say might... Upset someone. You shouldn't have to protect anybody. Protect anybody? I'm not protecting anyone. That doesn't even make any sense. I swear to you, on my honor, you can trust me. Is that it? Can I use the bathroom now? [Cell phone buzzing] Hi, drew. I just got an email reminding me that the ransome gallery's having a group exhibition, opening tonight. The gallery just sends me these things because I bought something there once. Do you want to go? We can mock any of the art that we don't like. We'll do it in low voices so we don't hurt feelings, okay? So what do you say? Well, it sounds like an adventure. Text me the address and I'll meet you there. Yeah, uh, I look forward to it. See you tonight. What? Hey, he's alert, oriented, and ambulatory. Just your type. [Cell phone buzzing] Maybe he can't wait till tonight. It's Lucy's school. They never call. Hello? I don't understand. If Lucy was having a problem at school, I think she would have told me. She seems distracted. I was wondering if you knew of anything in her personal life that might be causing it. I don't really know any of her friends, except Kaylie. Maybe you could ask one of them. And I'm not sure I know what you mean by "distracted." Her schoolwork is okay, isn't it? So nothing at home? Would you say your relationship with Lucy is a good one? Can we drop the vagueness and mystery? I drove here in response to your request, so if you know of some problem my daughter is struggling with, please tell me what it is, because I am not aware of any. All right. As someone with years of experience in this field, I can say Lucy seems burdened. She's carrying something too heavy for a girl her age. I'm sorry to see it, and maybe we can work together to help her. I can help my own daughter. I intend to speak to the principal about this, and I don't need to be concerned about Lucy's welfare by the vague imaginings of a high school guidance counselor, so I suggest you stick to advice on colleges, because that would be something useful. [Lucy] Oh, mom! Wait till you hear. Josh and I killed it. What's wrong? How could you call the school counselor on me? What? No, I... I didn't. I don't know what her problem is, because I didn't mention you at all. Not by name or anything. How, then? I asked if people could change. What does that even mean? Why would you do that? Why do you think? Look, mom, I know that you didn't mean for things to be this way. I looked this stuff up. Nobody really knows what it is. Some people think that it might be, like, related to ocd or something... Wait. You think I'm some kind of crazy hoarder? Look around, mom. Yeah, okay, I know it looks bad, but it's temporary, okay? I work hard, and then I'm tired when I get home, and yeah, I know some of it needs going through. -It needs throwing out. -Yeah, some of it. Which some of it? Well, when I go through it, I'll let you know which "some of it." But, you know, we can't afford to be getting rid of things we might need. We're not wealthy! Mom... Mom! Please, please just let it go, okay? I can't keep lying to people. You don't understand! No. No, I don't understand. Why does everything have to be so difficult? Why do I have to shower at school? Why do I have to move things around so that I can get to my closet? Why do I have to pour a bunch of water down the toilet just to flush it? I get it, it's inconvenient! But you know what you're forgetting is that it's all for you! I work hard for you! For me? Is it? All of this is for me? Are these dishes for me? -Are they? -[Dishes smashing] [Door slams] [Wheezing] [Cell phone buzzes] Hi, drew. I'm so sorry. No problem. Did you get stuck at the hospital? No. Actually, I'm feeling really under the weather, and, um... I'm sorry. I should have called before. I thought I might improve, but... Now I think I'm going to have to call it a night. You don't sound good. It's probably just something I ate. Take care of yourself. And don't worry. We can mock bad art another night. Okay. Thanks for understanding. [Sniffs] Okay, good night. [Sobs] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Cell phone ringing] Hey. Joanna. I hope you're feeling better. Yes, thank you. I'm calling for a reason. Okay. I've been thinking, and, um... I think we should take a break. A break from us? I mean, we've barely started anything. How can we have a break? It's just that I'm incredibly busy right now. You know, we're understaffed at work, and Lucy... Lucy really needs my attention. Oh. I want to see you again. Maybe some time in the future. It's hard to say when exactly. Well, it just didn't work out. It's... it's okay. You don't owe me an explanation. I mean, things happen, right? And... ...thanks for... Everything. How could you do that? You let him go because you couldn't let him into the house. Someday. I found some envelopes sticking up in the box that you left in my room. So I opened them. Is this why we can never go on vacation? I always have to say no to school trips? Why we can't afford the application fees for college? They... The amounts are misleading. There's a minimum you can pay. The minimums look pretty big. What's more important to you? You, me, and our life? Or six red enamel mixing bowls for the cooking that's never going to happen because we can't even use the kitchen? I bought them for us, so we can make soufflés together someday. Someday? Mom... Everything in this house is someday. [School bell rings] My band's playing at a birthday party tonight. You know, 18th birthday, entire small countries have been invited, and the parents are away, so this thing might run late. I'll be too busy playing for us to hang out much, but if you feel like showing up for a while... Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'll be there. Cool. I'll see you there. See ya. Hey, Phil, what are you doing here? Just on my way out of town. Thought I should check up on you before I go. Where are you going? Tahoe, for the week. My roommate's family's got a cabin up there, so the price was just right. Nice. Well, have fun. And... You don't have to worry about me. I don't? I've made up my mind. I'm going away to college. Far away. Mom's not going to be too happy to hear that news. I'm not going to tell her. I'm used to keeping secrets. Whoa. Look, I'll be 18 before summer. I'll get a job, a roommate... Survive until school starts. God, lu, this is a total 180 for you. Have you told Sara? No, and don't you tell her either. I won't. It's our secret. You sure you're okay now, leaving mom totally alone? You left her alone. Sara left her alone. Yeah, but that's because we knew you were with her. Was that fair? No. No, it was absolutely not fair. You didn't know how much I needed to hear that. I'm sorry, lu. I'm sorry. We haven't hugged since we left. We should do it every few years to keep in practice. Okay, all right, I'd better get going. I don't want to be driving on the dark mountain roads in a car whose battery is not that reliable. -Go. -Take care, lu. I'm sorry I'm not there with you right now. I'm just... I'm having one of my migraines. You have to get those checked out, Jo. I will, I will. Anyway, Dr. Ramirez said that if the patient doesn't respond well, we should call her at once. It's a big hospital, lots of staff. You don't have to be responsible for every patient. Look in on him once in a while, okay? Because he doesn't know how to use the call button. Do I have to come over there? No. No, no, no. No. No, um... Aw, hell. Calls are lighting up. I have to go. Take care, all right? [Rages] [♪♪] [♪♪] Can I ask what changed your mind? You were pretty set on a local school. I want a complete change. And how does your mother feel about all this? Well, legally, I'm almost an adult. Which means I'm going to start acting like one. I'm going to tell my mom about my plans. I don't want to go behind her back. Thank you for your help. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Wheezing] [Wheezing] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] Hey, mom? You dropped your inhaler. Mom? Wait. Mom, mom! No! Mom! Please! Mommy! No! Okay, okay, okay. [Sirens wailing] When paramedics responded to the call, they were shocked to find Joanna Tompkins dead in her home. She and her daughter, Lucy, lived here in one of the worst cases of hoarding imaginable. No, no, no, no, no... Oh, no, no. Um, um, um... Phil, Phil, Phil. Yes, Phil! Phil, please! I can't hear you! I can't hear you. Please. Mommy! [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] Mom, I'm not going to let them know. I promise. I'm not going to let them find out. No one will know. [♪♪] No one's going to know. [♪♪] [Cell phone buzzing] Hey. Luce, why didn't you tell me about this big party tonight? Oh, I must have forgotten. Aren't you going? No. It sounds like everyone on the planet is going. Look, Kaylie, I'm pretty tired, so... Ethan wants me to come. He's going to pick me up and said he can pick you up, too. No, okay? I don't feel like a party tonight, all right? I have to go. [♪♪] [Cell phone buzzing] Hey. [Kaylie] Ethan agrees we shouldn't let you miss this. We're coming over with fireworks to blast you out of bed. No, I told you that I can't. It's a semi-date. Come on, Luce, I could use some help. What if we languish in silence during the car ride? You'll be fine. I'm just asking you to help keep things from getting awkward on the way, maybe have a drink when we get there. Look, I know you've got some kind of neurotic thing about your house, but we are friends. I don't ask much, and I'm walking toward the car now. [♪♪] Your hair is getting so long. [TV playing] Oh, look. Lucy, don't you need a new wallet? [Lucy] Sort of. I mean, mine is falling apart. Well, Christmas is just around the corner. Maybe Santa will bring you one. They're expensive. They're 20% off. What color do you think Santa should bring you? I don't know. Just anything but pink. Oh, mom. [♪♪] [♪♪] [Car approaching] -Hey, Luce. -Hey, guys. Um, look. I'm not really feeling up to it tonight. You always say that, and then you have a great time. Look, if you go inside, we're coming in after you. I'm not kidding. Okay. Yay! [Party music throbbing] Yeah, everyone is at this party. Sorry I was such a pain earlier. I knew you'd feel better once you got here. Yeah. I'm actually going to head inside and look for a washroom. I'll be right back. Okay. Find me, okay? [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] Didn't you just get here? Don't tell me you're bored of the music already. Hey, are you okay? Don't be nice to me tonight. I'm on thin ice. What happened? I can't stay and talk. I have something that I need to go and deal with. You look like you're about to go do battle. Yeah. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Lucy] What are you doing here? You're asking me? You texted there was an emergency. I called mom at work and they said she was home sick, and she didn't answer her phone. She wasn't feeling well earlier. She's fine now. She just... She went to bed early. Well, maybe I should check on her. And wake her up for no reason? She's fine. I told you. Okay? How do you know? Wait, where were you just now? I was at Mrs. Ray's place. She was panicking because her dog's sick. The dog is fine, too, just in case you were wondering. Are you trying to get rid of me? Yes. Go away. I didn't do anything. Yeah, that's right. You did absolutely nothing. You just disappeared. Dad left, you and Phil left, and I was the only one here to take care of her, and I don't need you. Mom doesn't need you. Because I am here for her. Fine, I'm out of here. I'll talk to mom tomorrow. You do that. [♪♪] [♪♪] Hey, mom... I'm sorry that I had to leave, but I'm here now... And I'm going to protect you.
