"...and when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbors, saying..." Ouch! "...he calleth to his friends and neighbors saying unto them, 'Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which were lost.'" I recollect the time Sam Hawkins lost his old sow. He come out one morning, the pen be busted down, the sow was gone. Sam lit out after her to find her. He had 67 other pigs that didn't run off but did Sam get down on his marrow bones and thank the good Lord for that? No, sirree. Not Sam. He hunted high and low for that old s... As I was saying, he hunted high and low for that old sow. About all he... About all he'd done that summer was hunt for that sow. Wouldn't even stop... Wouldn't even stop hunting when winter come. Sure enough, one night, when he's plowing home... One night, when he's plowing home through the snow, he seen something move in the shadows. Sam's... Sam's right scared. Figures maybe it's a bear. Then the... Then the... Then the bear grunts, and it ain't no bear at all! It's the sow! Well, Sam was fitting to be tied. The rejoicingest man you ever seen. Ten times as rejoiceful for the lost one as for them that stayed in the fold. Now this here... Now this here... Now this here is the point! Appears to me the devil be a-knocking at the door of a house of worship. If there's any of you want to go get him, you... you'd be free to go 'cause the meeting's over. Lookee here, Pastor Pile. Alvin York done shot his initials in this tree, "AY," plain as day. It were Alvin York, Ike Botkin, and Buck Lipscomb in their liquor. Who was you saying it were? Who was you saying it were? It were Alvin, Mrs. York. How be you knowing? It weren't Alvin, Mother York. It were the liquor.

How's it going? - Howdy, pastor. - Howdy, Luke. We were looking for you Saturday. Couldn't get here no more than fly. Roads are getting soggier and soggier - between here and Rugby. - That so? Water is so deep in some of them creek beds, had to use old Betsy's belly for a boat. Hiya, Zeke. I reckon you could have got here quicker if you'd have carried Betsy. Yeah. I wished I could get me another mule like old Flora. They ain't turning out mules like they used to. No, sir. What you got there, young fellow? The very latest thing in ladies' hats, the cloche model. Womenfolks around here wear split bonnets. Young 'uns goes bareheaded. Maybe so, but in modern merchandising the storekeeper endeavors to create a demand. Now, in this line of ladies' bloomers, very moderately priced, has the finest elastic in the waistband also in the knees. No amount of washing will make it lose its snap. Your first trip in these parts, ain't it? Yes. And we have them in three lovely colors which we absolutely guarantee will not fade or shrink. Plenty of room in the seat, too. I can tell you these garments are mighty popular with the ladies. - You can, huh? - Yes. Well, folks hereabouts wouldn't know what them things is for. - Lem? - Yeah. Here's your Nashville papers. Thank you, pastor. I got letters here for Tom Carver and Ed Watson, both back tax bills, I reckon. What does it say, Lem? Well... They're a-telling Cordell Hull's speechmaking over at Jimtown. Appears he's out running for Congress again. - It says... - I mind when Cord Hull weren't knee-high to a toad frog, running around in his shirttail. Just goes to show you what a fellow can do if he gets book learning. That paper's four days old. I read it over in Nashville. Yep? It took Luke three days of mule paddling to bring the mail from Rugby. I can believe that after driving over here from Jamestown. Jimtown. I thought it was Jamestown. It are. Well, anyway, since driving over here what I'd like to know is how do you fellows get into this valley? We were born here. Now look, Mr. Pile. I'd like to sell you some of these garments before the price goes up on account of the war. What war? Why, the... the war in Europe. Oh, that war. Yes. Certainly. Looks like the Germans might get into Paris. Don't you think? Well, we ain't done much thinking on it, mister. 'Tain't in our corner nohow. If you're hankering for trouble, it ain't scarce right here in these mountains. Oh, I ain't looking for any trouble. Yep, fighting could have been mighty plentiful down at the meetinghouse last night. Did you hear? Alvin York and two other fellows done busted up the meeting. That ain't a smithering to what he done in Jimtown. - Nigh split the jail, he did. - No! Raised such a rumpus, I had to turn him loose. Do tell. Old man Jarvis up Bear Creek Way told me he seen the three of them riding their mules hellbent for letching towards the Kentuck border. They reckon the liquor were getting low and they wanted to get there before they sobered up. Psst! Howdy, Mrs. York. Howdy, Luke. Howdy, Mother York. Tolerable, pastor. What can I do for you today? Could I be getting a can of baking powder and a poke of salt? Sure thing. I ain't having but five eggs and they're kind of puny. Oh, eggs are eggs, I reckon. I was plumb out of salt. Don't be taking it hard, Mother York, what you just heared. I ain't a-taking nothing hard, pastor, and I ain't making excuses for Alvin to nobody. Course you ain't, and I ain't asking you to. I'm right proud of Alvin. Got a right to be. Works hard, Alvin does, patching and scratching that poor land. It's mighty hard work getting corn out of rocks. Indeed it is. Who's to blame him if he busts loose now and again? Nobody, Mother York. Nary a soul. Of course, I ain't for Alvin doing like he does. A little religion wouldn't do him no hurt. No, it wouldn't. Pastor, I wouldn't be agin your talking to Alvin. You reckon it could do any good? Well... wouldn't do no harm. I'll be riding up and having a talk with him. I'm a-thanking you, pastor. George. Yes, Ma? I reckon I know where your brother's at. He's up the Kentuck border. Go fetch him. Yessum. Better be taking a piece of pone for your supper, son. Yessum. - Hiya, Marty. - Hi, Alvin. Marty, we wants to get us a bottle. Now look here, Alvin. You know, I know, and so do the sheriff you're from over here in Tennessee and I can't sell you no liquor unless you gets over yonder in Kentuck. Marty, you are the legalest fellow in these here parts if you ain't nothing else. Gotta be, in this business. Maybe our credit ain't no good in Tennessee. Ha! Bet it ain't no better in Kentuck. What will you be having, Alvin? You got any corn without no lye in it? No poison oaks leaves in it either. Ain't no lye in this liquor. Here. Plumb hollow I am, like an old, burnt-out stump. Me, too. What are we drinking to, Alvin? What will we drink to, Ike? Well, I reckon we drunk to pretty near everything there are. Can't think of nothing new. Me neither. Reckon we better begin all over? If... if we can't drink to something, why don't we drink agin something? Agin something? Agin what? Oh, agin something or somebody we're agin. I ain't agin nobody or nothing except getting sober. Well, drink agin that. You'd be a-killing two birds with one stone. Go on. Swear. Ain't never gonna get sober. Hmm. Never going to get s... Well, I'll be blowed. What are you doing here, George? Young 'uns like you ain't got no business in a place like this here, nohow. Now just you skedaddle. Ma wants you, Alvin. - Now, look here, George... - Ma wants you. Shucks. A gun. Well, reckon I better go. I'll be seeing you. His ma wants him. - Get up. - Whoo! Hey, quit that! Hold your horses, Marty. Here we go! Here we go again. I'm still a-coming. Say when you got enough. Say it. Enough. Enough. Ma wants you, Alvin. Ma wants you. Coming, George. - I'll be seeing you. - So long, Al. Here he are, Ma. Took a heap of looking, but he come easy. Fetch me a pail of water, George. Yessum. Breakfast ready now, it is. Better be getting at it. South field needs a-plowing. The Lord bless these vittles we done got and help us to be beholden to nobody. Amen. I'm a-reckon you'll want some salt on your pone. Whoa, Fred. Get up, Noah. Whoa. - Howdy, pastor. - Hi, Alvin. I been kind of expecting you. I'm right sorry about... the other night. I... I reckon I done the wrong thing. Hmm. See that rock, Alvin? You been plowing around that rock a heap of years. Sure have. Did you ever think when you start plowing your furrows crooked, it's mighty hard to get them straight again? I never thought on it much. Well, it's that-a-way, I reckon with other things 'sides plowing. Satan's got you by the shirttail, Alvin. Sure has. Get up, Noah. He's going to yank you straight down to Hell. You are plumb right, pastor. You got to make him let loose of you before it's too late. I sure wish I knowed how. Wrestle him, Alvin, wrestle him like you would a bear. I done wrestled him, pastor, but... Whoa there, Noah. Whoa. Whoa, Noah. But old Satan, he hangs on tight. You and the Lord could throw him, Alvin. Why, 'twixt the two of you you'd have old Satan down in a jiffy. I sure wish the Lord would throw in. He will if you ask him. Oh, I done prayed, pastor, till I was black in the face. But it weren't no use. It ain't only praying, Alvin. It's believing. Now, you see here. Take a look at that old oak yonder. Looks mighty strong. Been standing there since your pa was a boy a-plowing in this same field. Looks like it can go right on standing all by itself, don't it? Yeah. Just a-resting itself and a-feeding on the earth. Well, it can't. It can't stand there without there's a lot of deep roots a-holding it up. Can't see the roots, but they're there just the same. It appears to me it's been planned a fellow's got to have his roots in something outside his own self. I reckon I ain't found no roots what will hold me up when... when I'm hellbent to fall. And then take the animals in the woods. Squirrels would go mighty hungry if nothing made them store up - nuts for the wintertime. - Sure would. How do you reckon birds get to fly north in summer if there ain't something a-guiding them? A bird ain't got no way of telling north from south. And then there's the bees. Bees would sure be in a fix if they weren't beholden to something to show them how to get back to the hives. Well, I ain't no bird and I ain't no squirrel and I sure ain't no bee. - Well, that's right, Alvin. - The way I figure, ain't no use for a fellow going out looking for religion. It's, really, it's just got to come to a fellow. It'll come, my boy. You'll see. Maybe slow like the way daylight comes and maybe in a flash like a bolt of lightning. - When? - Uh.. When you ain't even expecting it. Well, I hope so. Get up, Noah. I'll be seeing you. Get after him now. It's mighty fresh, less than an hour old. Reckon it's a red fox? Might be red, might be gray. He's making a big circle. Can't tell about his course till he gets out on the flat. They took to the hi" there. Yeah. That-a-way. What's the matter, Alvin? Howdy. - You're Alvin York, ain't you? - Yessum. Let's get going, Alvin. I ain't seen you in a coon's age. Where you been keeping yourself? - Hereabouts. - What's ailing you? Are you coming, or ain't you? You better go get that fox, George. You're just touched. How's your ma'? I asked you how your ma was. Tolerable. I figured it was you out a-hunting. No mistaking the voices of them hound dogs. One's a-having a hook to the end of his bay you could be hanging a bucket on. The other's a croak, just like a frog about moonrise... which... You ain't Gracie Williams, are you? Oh, well, I ain't nobody but. Why, you was only just... You sure growed up, all of a sudden-like. Reckon I have. Sounds as if they run that fox to ground.

Mmm. Asked her yet? No, I ain't. Hmm. What's the matter? I ain't said nothing. Reckon that'll hold. Reckon it better. - Hold it that-a-way, Zeb. - Hmm. Figuring on going to that there shindig next Saturday night, Miss Gracie? Oh, I ain't been asked. Well, you've been asked now. Can't say, Zeb. I'll have to think it over. - Well, I... - Joshua, book 10. Verse nine. You could be a-coming if you wanted to, Miss Gracie. Maybe I could, and maybe I couldn't. - Why, it's Alvin York! - Hmm. - Howdy, Miss Gracie. - Howdy, Alvin. You're knowing Zeb Andrews, ain't you? Howdy. Knitting, Zeb? He was just a-helping me. I weren't expecting you to be a-calling so soon. I said I'd be seeing you. Last time I seen Alvin, he was chasing a fox. He stopped here for a spell to... kind of catch his breath. - Did you kill that fox, Alvin? - I sure did. We run... That a gray fox or a red? Red. Just to... A red fox skin ain't worth nothing this time of year. That little hollow... This one were. "...and Asa begat Josaphat and Josaphat begat Jo..." It's just Uncle Lige talking to hisself. Zeb here was telling me there's going to be a dance over to Thompson's Mill. Yeah. I hear that... Ed Morgan's going to do the fiddling. And I was figuring that... Just about the best fiddler in these here parts, he is. - He ain't. - If he ain't, who be? - Todd Haskins. - Ah, can't hold a candle to Ed. You're a-thinking. - I'm a-knowing. - Oh, you are, are you? Now, now! Hush up, you two. There ain't no call for fussing over a fiddler. We weren't a-fussing. I were telling him. - And I'm a-telling you... - Shh-shh-shh! The way I figure, Ed's better at the jigging and Todd can sure fiddle a square. "It biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder." Uncle Lige there was a-telling me the corn's right good this harvest. How's the crops up your way, Alvin? Oh, we figure to get about 20 bushel to the acre. We're going to get about 60. Well, there's a heap of difference 'twixt farming - the bottom land and the top. - Well, there sure is. - I reckon... - I don't see how you could get five bushels off that there land of yourn. Now, look here, Zeb Andrews. Miss... Miss Gracie, I'd sure be much obliged if I could have a cup of water. Got some nipping cider. Well, that'd go mighty good. I'll be getting it. "...and the lion shall lie down with the lamb. And the..." Here's your cider. It's coming from the... Where's Zeb? Well, what's he... I reckon he lit out. Well, ain't he coming back? No'm, he ain't. - That strikes me mighty queer. - Yessum. "...whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might." Alvin, you did... You was fighting! It weren't much. Alvin York, I... You ain't a-fitting to come a-visiting a girl! He ain't got no business around here anyhow. As much business as you have, Alvin York. - No, he ain't. - Well, why ain't he? - Well, he ain't because... - Because why? Well, because, because I'm a-going to marry you. You what? I'm a-going to marry you. Now, now, now, now, Alvin, you stop that. Don't you be saying things like that. - Don't you be saying them. - Well, I are. Well, you damn ♪... - Well, you are, are you? - Yessum. Well, you ca... Well, you might have told me about it! That's what I'm a-doing. Well, I never... You look here! I wouldn't have you on a Christmas tree, Alvin York! Hmm. Fine husband you'd make. And Zeb Andrews would make a better one? Oh, how should I know? Maybe he would. Zeb Andrews got a piece of bottom land. That's it, ain't it? You're thinking that's it, are you? Folks say you're no good except for fighting and hell-raising and I'm thinking they're plumb right! If I had a piece of bottom land, I guess it'd make a heap of difference, wouldn't it? - A piece of bottom land! - Well, I can get some. Well, go and get it. I ain't a-caring. There ain't nothing I can't get if I set my mind to it. You don't think much of yourself, do you? Yessum. I do. Amen. That there is bottom land soil, ain't it? Queer how the folks that lives on the bottom looks down on the folks on top. Were always that way. Ain't no changing it. Well, I'm a-gonna change it. I'm a-gonna get us a piece of bottom land. Your pa set out to get hisself a piece of bottom land once. Nary a man ever tried harder. Like to kill hisself trying. Was a long time 'fore he give up but he had to in the end. Well, I ain't a-setting myself up as a better man than Pa. I reckon I ain't half as good. But I'm a-knowing where... where there's a piece of bottom land to be had... and I'm a-gonna get it. Maybe you will. How old you say this here mule be? Nine year, but Abraham's sound. Yes, he are. He's kind of pussle-gutted, it appears to me. Nary a bit. He's just mighty well-fed, that's all. Well... I reckon I might allow you.. Thirty dollars on him. - Thirty dollars? - Yes. You say 30 dollars? Well, he's worth 40 if he's worth a cent. Then he ain't worth a cent. What's all this here you got? Well, there's two dozen pullets. Six dollars. Well, that's 25 cents apiece. They're worth twice that much. Not to me, they ain't. What are these? Them's prime winter pelts, Mr. Tomkins. Mighty poor. They won't fetch much. I... I might allow you a dollar and a half apiece on them. Well, I can get three dollars apiece for them in Jimtown. It's quite a ways to Jimtown. Let's see now. That's 40 dollars and 50 cents. What else you got? Well, there's two sacks of rabbit skins, this here clock, and a sack of goose feathers. Well... I tell you... I tell you, Alvin, I'll give you 50 United States dollars for the whole caboodle. Fifty dollars for everything? That's the best I can do. Sounds like an awful little. Take it or leave it. Can you... can you do any better on the price of that land? Not a cent. 120 dollars. How much time have I got to pay for the rest? Sixty days. It's a bargain. I'll take it. Well, then, I reckon we can put it in writing. You understand now, don't you, Alvin, if I don't get my money afore the 60 days, you lose the whole caboodle, and you don't get the land. Now, 70 dollars is a lot of money for a fellow like you to get his hands on. It's more than a dollar a day. Now, then, 60 days is all you got. Sixty days and 60 nights. What? Well, the way I figure, if I count the nights, too, I got nigh onto four months to pay you off. Well, that's one way of figuring it. Well, I'll tell ya, I was figuring on taking them rocks out myself, Alvin, but if you're willing to take on the job, it's 75 cents a day. Well, I... - I'll take it. - All right. Yes, sir! Well, I'll tell ya, I was thinking maybe I could shoe your mules for you. Sorry, Alvin. Had them shod just yesterday over at Possum Trot. Might give you two, three days' work, though, splitting rails. That's good. Oh, reckon it's worth about... - Three dollars. - Three dollars? Why, that's a right fair price, pastor. I only worked two days to get it. It's worth it... to me. All right, George. Here we go. Giddyap. Giddyap. Come on. - Giddyap, Noah. - Giddyap, Noah. Come on, Noah. Come on. Whoa, Noah. W-Why, Miss Gracie, I... I was thinking you was to the dance. No. I ain't at the dance. No. No, I can see that. Alvin, I... Yeah? Alvin, I just... Yeah? I... Alvin... Oh. That's what I was wanting to tell you. Giddyap, Noah! Lord... Lord, if you can, help him to be a-getting his land. Amen. All right, George. Again. Again. Got to get under there. 'Tain't no use, George. I can't do it. Yes, you can. I tell you, I can't do it! My time's up tomorrow night. There ain't enough money for the bottom land! I can't get the rest! How? How am I going to do it? Howdy, Alvin. Mr. Tomkins, I got to talk to you. Well, I reckon it's money what talks the loudest. You got the rest of your payment? - No, I ain't got it all. - That's bad. But I can get it for you by Saturday. Saturday ain't Tuesday. All I'm asking is for four extra days. How can I be sure you'll get it by Saturday? Well, there's a beef and turkey shoot a-coming up. - You must have heared about it. - Yeah. Well, I'm aiming to cut five targets and win the beef critter and then put him up for cash money. - It ain't likely. - Oh, yes, it are. That'll take some shooting, Alvin. - I could do it. - Well, uh... - I'd like to do you a favor. Alvin, but... - Will you? There's another fellow asking for that land. - You ain't letting him have it. - Um... I was telling him, uh, your option was up Tuesday and... But I-I got to have them extra days, Mr. Tomkins. - I just got to. - Oh. I oughtn't to do it, but I reckon he can wait till Saturday. Oh, thank you, Mr. Tomkins. I'll sure get it for you. Yes, I sure will. Plumb missed him, but you cut wood. It ain't the log you're supposed to shoot, Zeke. It's the critter behind it. You better get yourself a pair of them specs, Zeke. He won't stick his head up so I can get a shot at him. Jim Corey, next shooter. Reckon he's laying an egg back there, Jim? Yeah, he might be. - You missed! - Doggone it. That turkey can sure hide. Maybe he wants to keep his head. Alvin York, next shooter. Bust him in the eye, Alvin, if he winks at you. Shoot him when he ain't looking. You better sight him mighty fine, Alvin. That there's the last turkey. You can't hit him if you can't see him, Alvin. Better wait till he goes to roost, Alvin. - You got meat! - Yoo! He sure busted him wide open. I reckon you just got to talk their language, Alvin. - I reckon you do. - You sure got him, Alvin. Ought to be eating good if he ain't too tough. This here bird ain't for eating. Oh, fellers, get your targets ready for the beef shoot. Rules same as always were. Shots are a dollar apiece. The two best shooters get the hindquarters. The next two get the forequarters. The fifth man gets the hide and the tallow. The sixth man gets to dig the lead out of the tree. All right. Pay your dollar and draw your number. Load her up careful, George. We got a long ways to paddle. - Here you be, Alvin. - Thank you. Hey, Zeke, you ain't paid your dollar yet. Why, sure enough. I reckon it just slipped my mind. How much for this here bird? I can't give anymore than one shot, I reckon. I'll be a-taking it, and give me four more. Five shots? Am I hearing you right, Alvin? I'm a-wanting five shots, Lem. You figuring to get that whole critter? My mind's sort of running that-a-way. Where did you get them ideas, Alvin? You sure got some shooters agin you. They'll get a chance when I put the critter up again. I'm a-needing cash money, and I'm going to get it. Hm, ain't nobody ever cut five centers unless'n it were Daniel Boone. And you ain't wearing no coonskin hat. I ain't a-needing one. Number eight, next. Number nine. How do they stand so far, Luke? Ain't nobody cut center but Alvin York. Alvin, you cut dead center all four time. Two more shooters. Tom Carver, you're first. Alvin has got one more coming. Get going, Tom. You better draw down, Alvin. Alvin's got to do it. He's been shooting to beat that. You got to beat Tom's shot if you want to get the whole beef, Alvin. What do it look like? Looks like plumb middle to me. I never thought he could do it! I tell you, he had good aim. Hm. Well, Tom ain't more than a hair off but Alvin done cut dead center fair and square. Howdy, Daniel Boone. There's your beef, Alvin, all yourn. Five centers is right smart shooting. Haven't seen the like since the big one. Well, any of you fellers want another chance at that critter why, just drop a dollar fees in this here hat. Are you shooting agin us, Alvin? - No, I ain't, not this time. - I ain't got a dollar. - Lend me a dollar. - Here's my dollar, Alvin. You... you lend me a couple of bucks... - Howdy, Ms. Miranda. - Howdy. - Hello, boys. - Hello there. Y'all come over to see the shooting? - Yeah. - It's all over now. Alvin York cut center five times and won Lem's beef critter on the hoof. - Alvin won Lem's beef critter? - Sure did. - Well, I'll be damned. - And he's putting him up again. Well, boys, get your targets ready. Oh, Mr. Tomkins, I was just coming over to see ya. There you be, 26 dollars, and I got the rest of it right here in my pocket. Well, I-I'm right sorry, Alvin but I just sold that bottom land to Zeb here. What? You're telling me you... Now don't go rearing up, Alvin! I never figured you'd get that money. Anyway, your time was rightly up last Tuesday. Why, you allowed I could have more time. Yeah, but it weren't in writing. But I was a-taking your word for it. And Zeb here paid me cash money all down! - He did, did he? - Now it ain't my fault. - He sold it to me. - Now, look here! Alvin, Alvin, but you're high... Wait a minute! Say, get out of here. - You better git, both of you. - It ain't no use, Alvin. You'll only be fixing yourself for trouble. I was... I was aiming to get that piece of land. Well, it weren't to be. Mind you, Alvin, we can't always figure the ways of Providence. Alvin... Alvin, i-it don't make no difference. It do to me. Come on, Buck. Whoo! Whoo! Swing her, Buck! Swing her! I sure do admire big women. She's about the biggest one I ever did see. Ho-ho, ho-ho! Three women in one she is, Alvin. A whole passel of women. Hey, a fellow who marry her be a, a bigamist. See? Big? Muss? Yes, sir, a bigamist. Told me I could have them extra days. Aw, come on, Alvin! His word weren't no account. Forget about Nate Tomkins, will you? Quit pestering yourself. It ain't no use. Look at that there big woman. Why don't you have a turn with her, Alvin? Take you back to your log-rolling days. Business is business. Well, once to round her is, is twice to round Bear Mountain. - Whoo-ha! - Look at Buck here, Alvin. - He's plumb tuckered out. - I sure am. Well, he might be, dancing around a whole passel of women that-a-way. 'Nother bottle, Marty. That land were mine. Ain't nobody going to get it away from me. I'd sure like to see you toad-hop her about, Alvin. I'm a-drinking agin Nate Tomkins. Now, how about that there big woman? Alvin, you better be a-staying here. - Let go of me. - We go along with you. What I got to do is my own. It sure ain't a good night for a-killing.

Look here. Stand where you are. Don't you come any closer. Mr. Tomkins, I just wanted... Come closer, and I'll hit you. No need of getting riled, Mr. Tomkins. I ain't a-looking for no trouble with you. What you doing around here? Well, I want to talk to you about... - What about? - About Abraham. That mule's legally mine. You ain't got no claim on him. Well, I ain't denying he's... Stay where you are if you don't wanna be laid out in two pieces. Well, I was a-figuring on a-buying Abraham back. - Buying him back? - Yes, sir. My mule's kind of poorly, and something done happened to him and... and I sure need a mule. - Are you meaning it? - Yes, sir. No hard feelings? Well, shucks. No, Mr. Tomkins. Well, I'll be damned. And, uh, and there's one more thing. I'm asking your forgiveness for a-flaring up at you the way I done. It were Satan a-speaking out of me. Hm. Zeke was a-telling me, but I, I couldn't believe it. - About what? - That you got religion. Well, that's a fact, Mr. Tomkins. Well, I'll be damned. Well, I sure would like to be a-buying that there mule back. You would, huh? Yeah. How much would you be asking for him? Well, let's see. You said he was worth 40 dollars, and I allowed you 30 dollars. That's right. Well, You can have him back for 20 dollars. Oh, Mr. Tomkins, Abraham's worth a sight more than that. Maybe he is, but seeing as how I'm trying to do the fair and square thing, Alvin twenty dollars, Well, I reckon I know what you're thinking. It's more blessed to give than to receive. Maybe. Come on. Get your mule. And another thing, I'm going to give you back - the clock you sold me. - You are? Yeah, it don't run, nohow. - Howdy, Mr. Andrews. - Howdy. I'd kind of like to see Zeb. Are he here about? Maybe he is. I sure would like to have words with him. You coming peaceful? Yes, sir, Mr. Andrews. I ain't looking for no trouble. Zeb! Come out of there. There he be. Howdy. What you be wanting with me, Alvin York? I want to talk to you, Zeb, about, uh, about that there piece of land. I bought it. It's mine. Well, I know it, but, uh... uh, sure, it's yours, Zeb, but... but Nate Tomkins was, was a-figuring that... I ain't a-caring what Nate Tomkins was a-figuring. Well, Nate was just thinking... It's mine, and I'm going to keep it. Well, sure, it's yours, Zeb, but if you only allow me to talk, why... Ain't nobody a-holding you. Oh, yes, they are. Well, anyway, Nate was a-thinking that you as being so busy here maybe you need some extry help on t'other piece of land. Well, what's that got to do with you? Well, I'm asking you for the job. You mean, you're, uh, aiming to work for me? I'd be, if you allow me. Why, shucks. That sure got me stumped. I was a-buying that land just to spite you. Well, I, I sure don't blame you none. Well, maybe we can figure it so you can sharecrop the piece. Then you'd kind of be a-working for yourself. No, I ain't asking for anything extry. Well, if you can farm that bottom land like you been doing the top, I reckon that land will be yours in a couple of seasons. Well, with the help of the Lord, I'll make you a good crop. Like I'm saying, Ms. Gracie, I ain't ever seen a prettier piece of land than that there Andrews farm. Corn is thicker than fur on a squirrel and I seen eight beef critters a-grazing in the pasture there. That are a lot of critters. And that Zeb Andrews sure are a forgiving man. - Are he? - Yes, sir. Be a-sitting, Alvin. And a Christian man if I ever seen one. Reckon so. What I done to him that night we were visiting you weren't right. The devil was a-pushing me from behind. It were too dark. I couldn't see. I didn't have no call to come 'twixt you and him. What are you getting at, Alvin York? A-all I'm aiming to say, Ms. Gracie, is a upstanding man like Zeb Andrews would make a gal a right smart husband. - What's that? - And... and if'n you change your mind about Zeb, well, I, I reckon I could... You could what? I could rightly understand. Oh, you could, could you? Looky here, Alvin York, if I wanted Zeb Andrews for a husband I reckon I could get him without your acting so noble. - I done kissed you, didn't I? - Yes. Well, I don't go around kissing men I ain't going to be a-marrying. Now you be a-listening to me. Am I marrying a piece of land? - Yessum. No'm. - Or a beef critter? - No'm. - Or a field of corn? No! It's you I'm marrying. Ain't nobody else in this here world. - Are you hearing me? - Yes. Well, then don't you talk that way to me again, - Alvin, now, don't you ever! - No. Oh! The Lord sure do move in mysterious ways. So that's what the Lord done said to Cain when he done killed Abel. It was a way of telling him that he wouldn't get no crops no more and anybody that's a farmer knows what that means. Alvin, how do you know that it happened just that-a-way seeing how you weren't there? Well, the book says so, and there ain't nothing written in the book that ain't the truth. So a long time after that, when the Lord was a-giving Moses the Ten Commandments he was a-saying, "Thou shalt not kill." Now, now go ahead with the reading. Hey! Hey! War! Hey! Hey, Pastor Pile! - What's happened, Luke? - It's war! President Wilson done declared war agin Germany. - You don't say. - Yes, sir. Says so right here in this here paper. Here you are, Jim. I reckon I won't wait to be drafted. I'm joining up as soon as the corn's in. - Me, too. - Attaboy, Tom. I heared my daddy talk about fighting Yankees and my granddaddy done fought in the revolution. Sure wish I was a young fellow. Well, come along, Zeke. You load 'em, and I'll shoot 'em. - Hi, Alvin. - Hi, Alvin. Hey, Alvin, what about you? You joining up now or are you waiting to be called? I reckon I'm a-waiting. - Howdy, Ike. - Hi, Alvin. - Oh, howdy, Alvin. - Good morning, pastor. - Reckon I need some coal oil. - I'm glad you come in, Alvin. - I were going to send for you. - You was? You ain't registered yet, have you, Alvin? Course I ain't. I-is that the new seed you was a-gonna send for? It's Tuesday, Alvin. You only got till six o'clock. I ain't a-going to register. Come here. You got to register, Alvin. I ain't a-going to. I ain't a-going to war. War is killing, and the book's agin killing, so war is... is agin the book. You're plumb right, Alvin. You've got the using kind of religion, not the meetinghouse kind, but... The kind I got's the kind you teached me. Yeah, I know that, and I hate to be telling you, but I don't want to see you get in no trouble. Now, you got to register, and there ain't no way you can get out of it. You mean they can make you go to war even if it's agin... No, no, no. They won't make you do that. It's what I want to tell you. Come here. It's right here. Yes. Now, wait a minute. Yes. There it is right there, see? "Members of well-recognized religious sects whose existent creed forbids its members to participate in war are entitled to request exemption from military service." What, what's that there exemption? Well, that means, uh, if you're exempted you don't have to go. Well, h-how do I get this exemption? Well, you got to write a letter to the draft board. Is that all there are to it? - Yup. - Well. Well, sure, I'll register. Well, w-will you write the letter for me? I'd be glad to, Alvin. Come on over here. "Therefore, we find that we can't consider your church a well-recognized religious sect organized and existing May 18th, 1917. We find further that it has no special creed, except The Bible, which can be interpreted by its members as they choose. And, finally, there's nothing in the creed of the church expressly forbidding its members to participate in war. Therefore, your application for exemption is denied." Uh, is this here the last word or has he got someplace to appeal? He can appeal to the District Board at Nashville and finally to the General Board in Washington. - Well, thank you, sir. - Thank you. You're welcome. I'll be writing them appeals for you, Alvin, so don't you be worrying. Oh, I ain't a-worrying. We'll be a-fixing this here bridge. There it is. We'll be a-building the house right over there by that tree. And the big room is gonna be... The big room's gonna be right, right here in front just like this, and it's gonna have three windows. And the kitchen will be here and it's gonna be good and big, too. - And there'll be a stove. - Where? Well, right about there. And I'm gonna build you one of them sinks and I'm gonna give you a pump so you won't have to carry no water from the spring. - A pump, Alvin? - Sure. Alvin, pumps cost a heap of money. Well, we're gonna have curtains in the windows and carpets on the floors and it ain't gonna take very long, either if the Lord keeps a-showering His blessings on me. Won't take more than two or three years, I reckon. Just to think, in two, three years a house right there where we're looking. And it'll be our house. Alvin! What do you want? Pastor Pile wants to see ya, Alvin. Well, Gracie and me's kind of busy right now. Well, tell him I'll stop by the store on the way home. He said he wants to see you right off. He said you'd best be a-coming. Well, tell him I'll be there. Shucks. Just when we was having fun. Would you be a-telling me again sometime? I sure will. - Howdy, pastor. - Howdy, Alvin. I got right bad news for you. Word just come. They're a-taking you for the army. Well, that can't be, that letter we done sent to Washington says that I was agin fighting, and... They ain't going to exempt you, Alvin. You got to report to Nashville tomorrow night. Well, I ain't a-going. You ain't got no choice. This were the last appeal. I don't care about that. I ain't a-going. You've got to go, Alvin. It's the law. What... what kind of law is it that says a man's got to go agin the book and its teachings? Well, I reckon there ain't no answer but... if you don't go, they'll be a-coming after you. Well, they won't get me. I'll go back in them hills. Yeah, and they'll put hounds on your trail and they'll follow you no matter how far back you go. Then they'd better not catch up with me 'cause they'll be a-wishing they hadn't! I... Sorry, pastor, I... Th-them's sinful words. I wasn't thinking of what I was saying. I'll go. War's away to t'other side of the ocean, Alvin. Lots of things can happen afore you get there. You put your trust in the Lord, and... He'll look out for you. I done forgot the Lord. Ain't never gonna forget Him again. Goodbye, Alvin. Well... I reckon these will do till I get fixed up in government clothes. The corn's doing right good on the south hill. Might need a little extra hoeing. Mule's at the gate. You got a long ways to go. Well, you'll be taking care of things from now on, George. Sure will. I guess you'll be needing a man-sized gun. You can have my rifle. I'm a-thanking you. Well... I'm going. I-I had to see you again, Alvin. I just had to. Now, now. No, no. Don't you be looking at me, please. Don't want you to be remembering me like this. Close your eyes, please. Yessum. Are they closed? Bye, Alvin. I'll be a-coming back. Bye, Alvin. I'll be a-coming back. Ma... what are they a-fighting for? I don't rightly know, child. I don't rightly know. Come on, you guys. Hit the dirt. Hit it hard. Okay, sarge. Look, Ross, that's not a teaspoon you've got there. It's a shovel. Lay into it. Okay, general. Dig, soldiers, dig! Dig your way straight down to China. - Okay, sarge. - China? What's the idea of going to China? I thought this war was in Europe. Parsons, Sergeant Early. Yes, sir. Which one of your men is York? Uh, he's the big, lanky fellow fourth from the end, sir. - Having any trouble with him? - No, sir. Why? He's down here as a conscientious objector. Keep your eye on him. I want a weekly report. Yes, sir. That'll be a big help. Dig, dig, dig. Phew! I've been working in a subway all my life. Never thought about the guys that dug it but since I'm in the army, I sure take my hat off to them. - Subway, you say? - Yeah. What's this here subway you're talking about? You mean to say you don't know what a subway is? That guy kidding? No, they don't have subways where he comes from I guess. They haven't? Ain't they civilized? - Where you from? - Pall Mall. Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf. - Where's that? - Tennessee. Ain't you ever even seen a subway? Ain't never even heared of one. You never what? Heared? Heared? What kind of talk is that? Do they all talk that kind of English where you come from? Well, there ain't any English people down our way, just Americans. Well, look, a subway is a big hole in the ground, see? - It goes for miles. - Straight down? Y... no, it doesn't go straight down. It goes this way. - Oh, this-a-way. Uh-huh? - Yeah. - U-under the ground? - Under the ground. - And trains run through it. - They run through it? - Yeah. - Steam cars? Stea--no. Steam cars. They're electric, Alvin. I sure would like to see one of them. You see, they have to run trains under the ground in New York because it's so crowded. Crowded? I'll say. Look, it's the rush hour. The Bronx Express is just pulling in. I'm standing on a platform holding back the mob. The doors open up, and I... You know what I'm talking about? - Oh, just a word now and then. - Well, you see, the people are just coming from work and they wanna get home, see, and they wanna get into the cars all together. They start pushing, I'm trying to hold 'em back. Well, anyway, the doors open up and now, buddy, this is where the fun begins. "Move back in the cars," I yell. There ain't no room in there, but I yell, "Move back in the cars." Boy, how I used to push 'em in. I used to pack 'em in like sardines in a can. That's why they call me Pusher. All right, Pusher. That's mess call. - Get a move on. - Yes, sir. This is the one bugle call I ain't got no arguments with. - Two-four-one-eight-double-oh. - Tudanopolis, Nick. Two-four-one-eight-oh-one. - Two-four-one-eight-oh-one. - Ross, Michael T. Hey, this one's full of grease. Ain't you got a clean one? Clean it, buddy, and keep it clean. Sure. Two-one-eight-one-oh-two. Two-one-eight-one-oh-two. York, Alvin C. Anything wrong with it? That sure is a fine rifle-gun. I thought maybe you might have some conscientious objections to it. No, sir, I ain't. Careful you don't kill anybody with it till you get to France. - Next man. - There you are, York. Two-one-four-eight-oh-three. - Two-one-four-eight-oh-three. - Thomas, Bert E. Boy, look at that shine! Is that clean or is that clean? Look, sarge, you can eat right off the trigger. Not bad. You call that clean? What's the matter with it? Look. I don't see nothing. It's full of grease. Won't that make the bullet come out faster? Clean it. That's a good job, York. Did you ever clean a rifle before? Ain't never cleaned one like that before. I done cleaned my own, though. So you've got a gun of your own, have you? Yes. I wouldn't think you'd have one. Well, the next time get your sling a little higher on your arm. Okay. Pull in your necks, soldiers. Those rookies are gonna start shooting. Now, remember, you guys you're using real, live ammunition. A bullet hasn't got any brains. It'll hit whatever you aim it at, so don't start murdering each other. All right, let's go. Ready on number 30. Ready number 30. Not yet. We'll try it first. Relax, Ross. Loosen up. That's better. Take a deep breath. Blow. Let a little of it out. Hold it. Remember, keep your sights on the center of the bull's-eye. Take up the slack in the trigger gradually. Don't pull it, squeeze it slowly, just like you were squeezing a lemon. - Ready? - Mm-hmm. Aim. I can't hold it no more. All right, boss. Take another one. Aim. Fire. Look, Ross, you had your thumb sticking straight up in the air, just like that. Oh, yeah, that gives me balance. Oh, it, uh, gives you balance, does it? - Yeah. - Here. Load. Aim. Fire. Oh! Ow! My eye. Maybe that'll teach you to keep your thumb down. That's something for the rest of you men to remember. - A miss! - Miss! - Ready on number 29. - Ready on 29. Ready 29. All right, York, let's see what you can do. Aim. Fire. I ain't much good at this here practicing, sergeant. All right, next time get the sling a little higher on your arm. Press your cheek a little closer to the stock. Yes, sir. Make sure that front sight divides the rear sight in half. I reckon I know about that, sergeant. Oh, you reckon you know about that, do you? We'll see. Here. Here. Load. Aim. Fire. - A miss! - Miss! So you know about sighting, do you? I sure thought I cut plumb center that time. You did, huh? I can't no way see how I could miss that whole, great big target. Sharpshooter York requests a re-mark. - Re-mark 29. - Re-mark 29. - Uh-oh. - I didn't see that one. - A bull's-eye, four o'clock. - Bull's-eye. I can't figure out how I got way down there on the edge. Well, I reckon I can do a little better when I get used to this here rifle gun. Here's five chances to do better. Fire when ready. Hey. What are you wetting that front sight for? Well, it kind of cuts down the haze. I always wet my sights when I'm fixing to do some shooting. Okay. Do some shooting. - Bull's-eye, dead center! - Bull's-eye. Okay, York. You're on your own. - Bull's-eye! - Bull's-eye. - Bull's-eye! - Bull's-eye. - Bull's-eye! - Bull's-eye. Hey, look at this. Right through the marker. That ain't no rookie. That's Buffalo Bill. Let's see that target, sergeant. Bring 29 to the firing line. There's the first shot and here's the other five here. I reckon that there gun shoots a mite to the right. Where'd you learn to shoot, York? Well, I ain't never learned, sergeant. Folks back home used to say I could shoot a rifle before I was weaned. But they was exaggerating some. Yeah. Now, supposing these here cartridges is a flock of wild turkeys a-flying across the ridge coming this-a-way, see, right at me, now, which one of them would you shoot first? I'd take a crack at all of them and trust to luck. But you wouldn't have no luck that way, Pusher. No? Well, then I'd pick the motorman. - The what? - The motorman. The guy out in front. Well, that ain't right either if you wanna get more than one turkey. Uh, which one of them's got the most meat on them? Yeah. What's the answer? Well, if you shoot this one here, the leader, the rest of them will see him drop and fly off, see? So, you draw down on the last turkey here and then the next one, see, kind of coming from back to front. Then the rest of 'em won't know they're being hit. And, of... of course, they might flare off some when the shooting starts but if a feller's got himself a repeating rifle he's got a good chance of getting the whole flock. - Sounds all right. - Turkeys sure is dumb animals. Seems you picked up a good bit down in the hills, Alvin. Oh, anybody that's done any hunting knows that. Alvin C. York, report to Major Buxton immediately. - Yes, sir. - What have you been up to now? I don't know. I been aiming not to make no trouble. It's your move. Private York reporting, sir. Yes, York. At ease. York, uh, Captain Danforth has just handed me a report concerning you made by your company sergeant. Yes, sir? You have a very excellent camp record. Well, I'm mighty glad to hear that, sir. You applied for exemption, I believe, as a conscientious objector. Y-yes, sir. Well, I think we can disregard that. York, Sergeant Parsons recommends your promotion to the rank of corporal with special detail as instructor in target practice. Captain Danforth and I heartily approve. I congratulate you, York. Well, well, I'm much obliged to you, Major Buxton and Captain Danforth. Well, I'll learn them fellers to shoot the best I can like I already done with Pusher and Bert. I... I mean... Privates Ross and Thomas, sir, but... Well, I don't wanna be no corporal. What's that? I said, I don't wanna be no corporal. - Why not? - Here, wait a minute, captain. Let him talk. W-well, you see, I... Is it because of your religious convictions, York? Yes, sir. That's it. You see, I-I believe in The Bible and I'm a-believing that... that this here life we're living is something the Lord done give us and we got to be a-living it the best we can. And I'm figuring that a-killing other folks ain't no part of what He was intending for us to be a-doing here. Well, yes, in a way I agree with you. York, uh... With your permission, major. Certainly, captain. Sit down, York. - All right. - You, uh... you say you believe in The Bible. - Yes, sir. - Well, I do, too. But do you believe that The Bible means that a man shouldn't fight for what he believes to be right? Well, it done said, "Blessed are the peacemakers." Yes, I know, but, um... you remember that, uh, verse, I think it's in Luke, where he says, "He that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one?" He said that to Peter. But he done stopped Peter from using a sword. He said, "Them that lives by the sword will be a-perishing by the sword." That, uh, uh, further on. Yes, I remember, but... No, go ahead, captain, go ahead. But according to Saint John, he said, um, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world then would my servant fight?" Well, that's just the point, captain. He done said His kingdom were not of this world and that, uh, that are different. - Yes, but, uh... - Just a moment, captain. York, have you ever read this? History of the United States. Hm, sure are a lot of writing. Hey. Daniel Boone. Yeah. You know about him? Well, everybody down our way knows about Daniel Boone. First man into The Valley of the Three Forks. Yeah, he was quite a man, one of the greatest. And that book's full of great men. York, what do you suppose that Boone was looking for when he went out alone into the wilderness? Well, I never thought much on it. Was he looking for new lands? - Might be. - Maybe. Maybe for something more, something that a man just can't see with his eyes or hold in his hands, something that some men don't even know they have until they've lost it. Yes, sir? To be free. Now, that's quite a word, freedom. I think that's what he wanted. I think that's what sent Boone into your Tennessee country. Is that what... that what this here book's about? Yup. That's the story of a whole people's struggle for freedom from the very beginning until now, for we're still struggling. It's quite a story, York, how they all got together and set up a government whereby all men were pledged to defend the rights of each man and each man to defend the rights of all men. We call it a government of the people, by the people and for the people. Why, why, I never knowed it was all written down. You're a religious man, York. Yes, sir. You want to worship God in your own way. Yes, sir. - You're a farmer. - Yes, sir. You want to plow your fields as you see fit and raise your family according to your own lights. And that's your heritage and mine, every American's. But the cost of that heritage is high. Sometimes it takes all we have to preserve it, even our lives. How are you going to answer that, York? Well... you done given me a powerful lot to be a-thinking about. - I... - Well, take your time. Well, if I could only... if I could only get home back in them there hills, I... What would you do? Well, I could... I could figure something out. I done a heap of thinking up yonder there once. All right. Take ten days' furlough. You mean I can go home? When you get back, if you still can't see it our way, - I'll recommend your exemption. - You will? Report to me as soon as you get back. I'll arrange your furlough, York, starting tomorrow. - Thank you. - Good luck. I sure would like to read this here book. Go ahead. Take it with you if you want to. You can borrow it. Thank you, Major Buxton. Thank you, Captain Danforth. Come on, boy. Want me to be a-setting four places, Ma, or just three? Can't say, child. Ma, ain't Alvin ever going to eat again? The book says man don't live by bread alone. Well, what about that there hound dog he's got with him? He can't read the book. Get the table set. He's up at the point. Been up there all day. Want George to go get him, Ma? Let him be. Put your trust in the book, Alvin. But here's another book, York, The History of the United States. Them that live by the sword will be a-perishing by the sword. The government of all men to defend the rights of each man. Each man to defend the rights of all men. Remember the Lord done said thou shalt not kill. But the cost of that heritage is high, sometimes all we have to preserve it, even our lives. Obey your God. Defend your country. - Your God. - Your country. - Your God. - Country. - God. - Country. - God. - Country. - God. - Country. - God. - Country. "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's." Unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's. And unto God... God's. Private York reporting, sir. - Have him come in. - Yes, sir. All right, sergeant. I'm a-bringing your book back, major, and I'm a-thanking you. You're welcome, York. I done what you told me. I thought things over. Well? I'd like to stay in this here army. I rather hoped that you would, York. But there's just one thing, sir, that I ought to tell you. There's lots of things... there's lots of things I ain't figured out yet, lots of things still a-going on in my mind. But it's, well, it's just like Pastor Pile done told me. I reckon I can just be a-trusting in something that's a heap bigger than I be. York, as your superior officer, I don't feel called upon to look into your conscience. It's enough for me that I trust you and I believe that when the time comes you'll conduct yourself as a soldier should. Thank you, sir. And I'm going to approve your promotion to the rank of corporal. Why, I'll sure take care of my men the best I can, sir. I know you will, York. That's all. Thank you, major. Aren't you, uh, aren't you taking quite a chance, major? You mean as to whether he'll fight or not? No, I don't think so, captain. I don't think I'm taking any chances at all. "Dear Ma, am feeling just fine and have taken in all the sights and Bert took me to a church called Notre-Dame Cathedral. It's big enough inside for a fella to plant a crop of corn." "Pusher just come in. He's saying our outfit is moving up to the front pretty soon. I reckon that's so 'cause we got all our training and they ain't brought us here for no sightseeing tower-tour, nohow. Gracie wrote in her letter she was a-worrying. Tell her don't." I was fearing. I'm afeard for Alvin. It ain't right for us to be afeard, Gracie. Alvin's in good hands. The Lord takes care of them that's a-believing in Him. Any of you blokes got a cigarette? Yeah. Here you are. Thanks. You know, you yanks just got here in the nick of time. We're running shy of these. Besides, we could do with some help. Look out. It takes a while, but you'll learn when to flop and when not to. They say you never hear the one that's hit you. Ah, that's only half the truth. Nah, the whole truth is if you hears it, you've got a chance. Duck. See what I mean? Heinies got the range good. Yeah. A guy can get killed around here. Look out. Don't be afraid. This one will pass over. See? Takes time, it do, but you'll get the hang of it. Duck again. If that was shrapnel, now, we wouldn't be flopping at all. You know, you only flop for, I, uh... Okay, Bert, the express has gone through. Hey, Bert! If one's got your name on it, there's nothing you can do. So you see, gentlemen, the grave responsibility rests upon us. This entire German salient holding up the Argonne advance depends for ammunition and supplies on the Dakolva railroad, which as you know lies just beyond these hills. It must be taken. This is all open country ahead. But you can expect heavy machine-gunfire from these wooded ridges on the right and the left flanks, but we've got to get through. Synchronize your watches. Use as a mark four hours, 32 minutes. It is now minus ten, eight, six, four, two, mark. Any questions? What about artillery support, Captain Tillman? Artillery will lay down a rolling barrage at six hours. Zero hour will be six hours, ten minutes. I'd like to know where that barrage is that we're supposed to have. Runners, notify the platoon commanders that we go over, barrage or no barrage. First platoon at 6:10, second and third platoons to follow in waves of 100 meters. Yes, sir. - Six-ten. - Six-ten? All right. - Come on! - March! Fire! Halt! Take cover! We'll never get through. We got to wipe out those nests. Early, take what's left of your section and work your way back around that hill. Maybe you can jump them from behind. All right. Savage! York! Cutting! Bring your men. Come with me. Take cover. Listen. Heinie! Listen. We're not far enough back. Savage, keep the men quiet. Cutting, come up here with that banner. We're right behind their lines. We skirt this ridge and flank them. Look! Heinies! Come on! Get them! Hold your fire! Fall on down! And keep them covered! Spread out, men! Spread out! Line them up and disarm them! Get back! Go on. I'm hit bad, Cutting. Me, too. Savage. Savage. Where's Savage? I seen him go down. They like to cut him in two. You're the only noncom left. York, take over. - Did you hear what I said? - I heared you! Watch this feller. The rest of you, keep under cover. Come back here. Where are you going? You done give me command. Hey, Alvin! Well, he cleaned out that machine-gun nest. Zakini! Donahue! The rest of you guys! Keep your eye on them heinies so they don't try any rough stuff. Don't try anything funny. Bellies to the ground, you babies! We better get up there. No, we better keep an eye on these prisoners. Five will get you ten that guy knocks off your whole sauerkraut army. There are 25 machine guns on that ridge. - Tell him it's useless. - What did you say? I said, tell him it's useless. You tell him. You talk better English than I do. [Pushed Just like a flock of turkeys. All right, come on out of there, all of you! Come this-a-way! Tell the rest of them fellers to quit shooting and come on out of there! Keep them hands up and start a-going down the hi" there! Keep a-coming! Go on! Move out of there, down the hill! All right, keep a-coming! Hey, down there! Don't do no shooting! All right, get on down! Fall out and keep your hands up! Boy, I told you. Look at that mob. Hey, we can't handle all that gang. Sure, we can. That's my meat. Come on! Step lively! Move forward! Get along! Step lively! Move forward! Go on down there! Git! Move forward there! Come on! Step up! Step lively, there! Come on! - All right. - Get those hands up! Get in there! Come on! Come on! Get going! Nice going, York. Come on there! Come on, get in there! Get those hands up! Come on! Move fast! - Move! - Hiya, Pusher. - That was a good job, pal. - Where's the sergeant? Over there, hurt pretty bad. How many men we got left? Eight besides you. Watch them fellers. Get in there, you guys! Move forward! Move... Pusher! Pusher! This is where we change cars, Alvin. The end of the line. Who done that? Who throwed that grenade? Come on, you! Put your hands up and keep them up! You know what I'm a-saying? - You understand? - Yeah. Tell them men of yourn if any more of that happens you and a lot more of them's going to be mighty sorry. Go ahead. Tell them to drop their belts. Look them fellers over good! - You ready back there? - Okay here! - Okay! - Ready here! Watch them! Now get going. Tell them to halt. If you wanted to get back to the American lines which way would you be a-going? Up there. We'll go this-a-way. Go on. Hey, tell them to halt. What's up? Sounds like them heinies is making a heap of trouble. What are we gonna do about it? Get them. We got enough to take care of already. Then a few more won't make no difference. Hey, you, signal up there and tell them they're surrounded. Tell them to drop their guns and come down with their hands up. Hey. This gun touches off kinda easy. They sure are trained good, major. Hey, sarge, look. Looks like heinies. Stand ready. Hello there! A yank. Maybe some kind of a trick. There's something funny here. Let them get a little closer. - Hello there! - Who are you? Detail of the 328th! We got some prisoners! - Halt where you are! - Halt! That's a yank, all right. Come out! Let's have a look at you! Watch them, fellers! Keep them covered. Where you going? Can you tell me where the 328th be? It's up that way someplace. Where did you pick up all this bunch? Back up the line a ways. You couldn't be taking them off our hands, could you? What would we do with them? Well, I don't rightly know. Can we be a-going? - Sure. Go ahead. - Thank you. - Come on. - Forward! All right. Halt! Prisoners, hold right there! Be a-watching them, Joe. Beg your pardon, sir. - Yeah? - We all got some prisoners. Can we be a-leaving them here? Mm-hmm. Put them right over there. Wait a minute. How many have you got? Well, I done counted 132 head, sir. We haven't room for that many here. Take them back up the line. - Yes, sir, but... - But what? Well, sir, we can't find our outfit and we tried to drop them off two other places and there ain't but only eight of us to handle them. You should have brought more men. But that's all there were of us, sir. You mean to say that you and seven others captured all that bunch? Yes, sir, and we'd kind of like to get rid of them. Well, Good Lord! I guess we can give you some help. - Come on, sergeant. - Thank you. Hey, sarge! York by himself captured 132 Germans. Guy named York got 132 heinies all by his lonesome. - How did he do it? - Must have surrounded them. - Guy named York? - That's what they say. Gee, he captured hundreds of Boche and machine guns. Guy named York! All by his lonesome! Hey, what's that? How many? A whole division and a lot of high officers. - I'm telling you. - York was there. Yeah, about half the German army and their generals. - I don't know. - One guy. How could one guy... - Guy named York. - What's that? Say, he captured Hindenburg and the crown prince, brought them all back. - You see? - Hey... Say, sarge, did you hear? York captured the Kaiser. As I understand it, York, your detail came over that ridge there and captured about 30 men right down here. Yes, sir. And then you were forced to cover by a machine gun that was right up on this other ridge. Yes, sir. Right up there. Where were you? Well, I was, I was a-laying behind that log there. They was machine-gunning us pretty heavy, so I worked my way across up behind that log there under the hill. Rather incredible, wasn't it, York, your being able to cross so much open ground without being hit? I reckon the Good Lord was a-protecting me, sir. What did you want to go over there for? Well, I figured that was a good place to be because they had to rear up and show themselves in order to shoot at me and the rest of the boys back here and whenever they did, I could touch them off. I see. So, I went up the hill, up around that-a-way, then worked my way down the ridge to a place where they was flanked and couldn't show themselves without being hit so they, well, they finally give up. How many did you kill? I don't rightly know, sir. I think Captain Danforth is familiar with that, sir. We counted about 20 bodies altogether up around there. What were your men doing all this time, corporal? Well, I couldn't just answer that, sir. I was pretty busy, and I reckon they was, too. According to the statements of the others, they were guarding the prisoners and couldn't expose themselves to the fire from the ridge. All right, gentlemen. That's all, corporal. Oh, uh, corporal... there's something that I 'd like to know. Yes, sir? That night that you reported back to me at Camp Gordon, you as much as told me that you were quite prepared to die for your country, but not to kill. What made you decide to change your mind? Well, sir... Of course, if you'd rather not tell me why, that's quite all right. Well, I'm as much a-gin killing as ever, sir, but it was this way, colonel. When I started out, I felt just like you said but when I heared them machine guns a-going and all them fellers a-dropping around me, I figured that them guns was killing hundreds, maybe thousands, and there weren't nothing anybody could do but to stop them guns, and that's what I done. You mean to tell me that you did it to save lives? Yes, sir. That was why. Well, York, what you've just told me is the most extraordinary thing of all. Sergeant York. Thank you, sir. And for conspicuous gallantry beyond the call of duty you have been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Sergeant York, I am proud that you were of the all-American division. It's a privilege to command such men as you. Sergeant York, as commander-in-chief of the American Expeditionary Forces, it is my pleasure to confer upon you the United States Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism beyond the call of duty. Thank you, sir. I'm Cordell Hull, Sergeant York, representative from your district in Tennessee. I'm mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Hull. This is Mr. Harrison from the Tennessee society. Tennessee is indeed proud, sergeant. - Thank you. - This way, sergeant. Well, sergeant, what do you think of it? Appears like everybody's having a mighty good time. So, sergeant, in the name of the people of New York, may I present you this key to our city as a token of our very great esteem and may God bless you. Thank you for what you said and I'm sure grateful to you for this here key. Well, thank you. And thank you all. Well, sergeant, the people of New York would like to show their appreciation. Is there anything we can do for you? Well, there's just one thing I'd like to ask you. And that is? Well, if it's all the same to everybody, I sure would like to ride on the subway on the Bronx Express. I think we can arrange that. Well, here we are. Yeah. I hope you will be comfortable here, Sergeant York. Well, if I ain't, I'd be pretty hard to please. If there's anything you require, all you'll have to do is ask for it. Thank you. Thank you, sir. An awful lot of room for just one feller here. This here is mighty thoughtful of you gentlemen. I reckon you know I ain't seen my ma for quite a spell. So we understand. Representative Hull. Oh, yes, yes. Are they ready? Put them on. Somebody for you, sergeant. Me? Thank you. Hello? Hello there. What? Who is it? I-I-I can't hear you. Who is it? What's that you're saying? I can't hear you. Put it up to your ear, Mother York. Stand closer, Ma. When are you coming home, Alvin? I said, when are you coming home? Oh... I'm glad, son. I'll tell her. She's right here. He wants to talk to you, Gracie. It's me, Alvin! It's me, Gracie! We're all here in Pastor Pile's store. He's got this here phone in here now! Oh, I just can't wait to see you again, Alvin. I can't wait to see you! Yeah. Yeah, I'll be coming home, Gracie, right away. Yeah. Goodbye. Goodbye, Gracie. Goodbye, Alvin! Bye! Sure was nice to talk to the folks. I'm a-thanking you. You're welcome, sergeant. Just like the electric signs down the street. How do you like New York, Alvin, as much as you've seen of it? Mr. Hull? Yes, Alvin? I want to be a-going home. When do you think I can go? You're pretty anxious, I reckon. Yes, sir, I am. I've... I've got to get to work. Well, as far as that goes, there's plenty to do right here, Alvin. What do you mean? I've been wanting to talk to you about this. You're a pretty famous man now. Judging by all these offers you've been getting, it seems a lot of people realize it. For instance, two companies want you in motion pictures. Ziegfeld wants you in an act in his new follies. Here's an offer to appear at the Winter Garden. That's a theater. And here's a breakfast-food manufacturer who wants you to endorse his product. What do that mean? Well, to tell him how much you like it, how much good it's done you. Ooh. I ain't ever ate any of that there breakfast food. Doesn't seem to make any difference. Anyway, I have totaled the offers so far at the amount of around a quarter of a million dollars. They're offering me all that money? It's just a plain business proposition. I sure could do a powerful sight with that money. There was a piece of bottom land I was a-trying to get. Here's your chance to get it. Are they offering that money because of what happened over there? Well, uh... That's it, ain't it? That's it. What... what would you do, Mr. Hull? Well, I think that's up to you, Alvin. I reckon it is. Take all the time you want to think it over. I've done thought it over, Mr. Hull. I ain't proud of what happened over there. What we done in France was something we had to do. Some fellows that done it ain't a-coming back. So the way I figure, things like that ain't for buying and selling. So I reckon I'll have to refuse them. Would you be a-telling them that for me, please, and tell them I'm a-going home? I'll be more than glad to, Alvin. Thank you, Mr. Hull. There she comes, Zeke, right on time. There he is! Alvin! Alvin! Oh, Alvin! Well, Ma, I'm back. I'm right glad, son. Hey, Alvin, how about your medals? What about them, George? I thought you'd be wearing them. You'll be a-seeing them. They better be something big. As I was saying, Alvin, of course, I always figured on marrying you and Gracie myself but I ain't one to take the job away from the governor of the state. You're the dang swankest hero raised in these parts since Daniel Boone and Andy Jackson. Sure are, Alvin. Whee! Hang on, Rosie. Hey, uh, what about that there piece of land I was aiming to get in Tomkins' hollow? - Still there, I reckon. - Yup. Still there. Somebody else has got it by now, I suppose. Well, I... I couldn't rightly expect Zeb to hold it for me all this time. I sure would like to see that there piece of land, though. I reckon there ain't no harm in you seeing it, Alvin. I'd like to be a-seeing it, too. I'll let you off at the fork and you and Gracie can walk over to the hollow. Whee! Hang on, everyone. Hey, look here. Somebody done fixed up this old bridge. Yeah, they have. Gracie, I... I got to talk to you. It weren't just the land I was wanting to see. There's something we got to talk about. Miss Gracie, I'm plumb worried. What about, Alvin? Well, what with the governor a-fixing to marry us and all them people coming here from all over... Sure takes a body's breath away, but I reckon we'll get through it all right. Well, it ain't just that I'm worried about. Well, what, then? Well, it sure looks like I ain't got nothing to offer you excepting a big wedding. Some girls don't even get that. I reckon you'd like a place to sleep, wouldn't you? Oh, I don't know. I done a heap of sleeping while you was away. You sure ain't expecting too much of a husband. I'm expecting my husband to love me. I reckon the Good Lord will take care of the rest. Looks like he's done a heap already just a-having you but, well, I was expecting to take over from here on myself. I reckon you'll get to do your share. No, Gracie. It can't be that-a-way. We got to wait. Maybe in another two, three years, if you're willing to wait. Oh, but I ain't. That's the point. You mean you won't wait? There ain't no need of waiting. Now, Alvin, you keep a-looking down and don't you be looking up till I tell you. Come on. There! Now you can look. What do you see, Alvin? Tell me. It's yours, Alvin! It's all yours! They give it to you, the people of the state of Tennessee, for what you done! - You mean... - Ooh. It's 200 acres. And the house is bigger, with--with more windows a-and the kitchen's got a pump! And it's for us. The Lord sure does move in mysterious ways. Come on.
