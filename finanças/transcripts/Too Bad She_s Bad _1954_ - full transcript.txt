Hi Paolo. - Ah, are you here? - Hello good day. - I'm taking them to Ostia. Today ... - I have made a career. It's 11. Come take a bath. Yes, come on, Mr. Paolo! Are you crazy? I have to work to pay for it. Stop polishing and rubbing it. You are going to spend it before paying it. - See you later. - Goodbye. - Do you have dinner at home? - Yes, but whatever ... Be careful where we go! Goodbye! - Cab? It's free? - The bus is coming. And who pays me the lowering of the flag? - But hey ... - Us. Good... - Take your foot off the taxi, it's new. - My shoes too. But I don't step on him with the wheel. - Sorry. - No, excuse me. We want to go far. Towards Anzio, a little earlier. Where is the pine forest. A Lavinio, ¿no? Are we going with a meter or a fixed price? It depends. What time will they return? - Who knows? - When we get fed up. Then metered. - And how much will come out? - It is easy. It is 50 kms, if not more. 50, 100. Two hours standing ... Let's put 8,000 and no more talk. 8,000 until 5. The rest by meter. It's okay. - Let's go. - I want to take a nap. Okay, go to sleep. I already wake you up. Needless. Get in the folding seat. Is hot. No, me by your side! And the other? You're an Idiot. Come on what! It is true. I listened. I listened. Stop by S. Pietro. There I already indicated. Come. It's here? - Say, miss. - Will the folding seat lift me? Of course not. Ok, but I have a lot of work and we should start with that. Sure, you have to give it precedence. Okay, bring it to me and we'll see. Ah, the tires nothing. The tires are our thing. They are gorgeous. - Do you keep them? - But when bringing it ... give us a sneak peek. - One hundred. - And later? - It won't be much more. When do you bring it? - In a couple of hours. It is going well? - Good. And what's all this? What happens? So I am cooler. Come here. He sits on the folding seat . - And that one isn't coming? - No. Are you happy? All ready! #Bingo, bango, bongo. It's only # #good in the Congo. I don't move. # What are you guys saying? Shall we bathe in the marinara? - How? - Without going to the spa. We bathe as we came into the world. Voucher. Thus we save the booth. And I don't bring a swimsuit. - And what were you planning to do? - Rent it. - Gross! - Why? - I like my things. - Not the others? - No, I like my things. - What do you say? And that bag doesn't ... Wasn't it from Amalia? It was, and I didn't like it. Now it's mine and I like it. #Bingo, bango, bongo. It's only # #good in the Congo. I don't move. # - There is. Have you seen what sea? - Oh my! - So how did we come into the world? - For me... - Lina, you too? - I take off my dress and ready. Turn around here. Then there will be another way. Yes, and you pay for the plates . Of course. But you are very good. Slowly. - Stop here! - At least in the shade. He said it to do the maneuver later. You calm down, the maneuver is my thing. Clear. It's up to you, right? What if he's hungry later? No, don't worry, miss. Then we go to eat. - Are you not coming to bathe? - In this heat! No thanks, I'm fine here. This is our booth. Miss, please. No, get naked before. You can accompany us, do not bother. If he doesn't get shocked, why do we ... No, Lina? Clear. We want to feel free. A pinion. Another, look. There is a lot. Is that how we came into the world? You first. I did not want to bother you. - Come! - Desnúdate. No! What's the rush? You know what? I'm hungry already. - We buy something and bring it here. - I'm going with him. And what are you buying? If they tell me what they want I'll go with the car. No, we are running down the beach. - That is good. - And so we choose. Do you mind taking care of things for us? Thank you. - You have money? -Yes. - Come on, Lina, let's go! - No! Go fast. Take off your shoes, they will fill up with sand. Don't you see them? They have reached there, but they are far away. But they can still be seen from here. It makes me laugh with so many clothes. Take off at least your jacket. Ah, do you see? He is dark. You bathe too. If only I saw how strange. The water is green, green. You are right. It's so good in the sun. - But I would need a cushion. - Look, get here. - No, it's too low. - No, look how well it is spreading. That. Make me my cushion. This I needed. Hey, if you want I'll get a cushion from the car. Why? Is it that bad? - I just don't feel comfortable. - What does it mean? - Does not understand? - No. It is that you do not realize that a man, well ... AND? What is so extraordinary about a man? Listen, miss, you have been accompanied, I am a good person ... When he speaks he moves his stomach and it has a very strange effect on me. - Has your wife never told you? - What wife? I am not married. - And that? - The alliance is worn here. This was from my mother. - Hey, I'm going to get you a cushion. - Stay still, I'm fine. - Have you been wearing it for a long time? - It's the only thing I have left of the family. Two grandparents, grandmother's sister, father, mother, four brothers ... Bombing. - No one was left. - What a cross. - And you don't have a girlfriend at your age? - I know people, but ... is not the same. - Oh my God! The anti-theft! - What happen? - Car! - Does the car ring by itself? It's the anti-theft! Criminals, crooks! Rascals! - You will see! - What does he want? - What happens? - We wanted to go get bread. I'm going to give you bread! It was you who was hanging out with her. Passing with her! You were trying! Taking! Dammit! Look how I left the car! - What did they want to do to him? - Rascals. Did they want to steal your car? Take. It was crystal clear. Rascals! Rogue! What does? Why don't you call someone? Help! Burglars! Leave it, I'll get them. If you don't hurry ... But check this out. I should have noticed. It was enough to look at all three of you. Hey, watch what you say. I have nothing to do with this. Sure, you didn't agree, you weren't together, right? Okay, explain it to me? - Do I have to explain it to you? - And don't tutee me. - Do you take me for a fool? - Well, I get to know you too. But I'm not going to go looking for them. I will take you to the police station and you will give names, surnames and addresses. - Whose? - Yours first. Because you are the worst. I can see that. Watch this. And then you will give the name of your buddies. I don't know them. He had just met them. Oh yeah? A greeting. Goodbye. The mirror is for looking at the road. #Bingo, bango, bongo. # # It's only good in the Congo ... # When they lock you up, you will lose the desire to be funny. - But do you think he knew them? - No. You are stupid. I told you I don't know them. I was going to Ostia when I met them. "Do you want to go to the beach?" They say. "Sure, I do." "Let's go together?" And I answer: "I don't know them." "Has a car?", the tall person asks me. "If I did I wouldn't be waiting for the bus." And then they told me they were bringing me by car. And so we get to your taxi. But if they tuted you. I think they are not the only ones to befriend me. I saw right away that you are not a good woman. One that goes with the first to meet ... It was not one, but two. Is different. - Oh yeah? - And with you three. What were they going to do to me? I wanted to bathe. Well, you will pay dearly: You will pay for the race and the damage to the car. Me? What I have what see? They invited me to come, and now you want to take me to the police. And I'm going. You are strong, huh? Yes. Listens. At least we could both take a bath. How vulgar you are. Who do you think you are with? Look, I'm asking for help. Because I let you tutee me, Do you think you can take confidence? I'm the one going to the police station. And don't be angry. In any case, I should be angry. Sure, since the car is yours! Two years of work for the first term. PROHIBITED ADDRESS Pita, pita. Who cares? We'll do the math at the police station. Well, I'm done. You are exalted. Come here! Do you intend to escape? Give me a minute! I'll be right back! The papers and the card. - I'll be right back. Catch them, they are there. - Get the car out of there! Don't you see that it's obstructing the traffic? - It didn't stop when I whistled. - She's a thief! - But is he crazy? - Yes, I'm crazy. I shit on Nero. They entered this portal. I've looked at every floor, this is the last. Do not insist. No one has come here to look for anyone. I am alone, and I assure you that the desire to go to the sea passed me long ago. - What does he want? - Look for the friend of two young people that they wanted to steal his car. Chief. Listen, boss. I already explained it. See what mess? If this happens to me at the station with all the people ... I already told you, but you ignored me. There's nothing to do. You have to throw it all away. Like everything? You need a new spring, hinges, a hook, well, everything. And the dock can't be repaired ? I do it for me. But it is a waste of money. Trust me, pay it and forget it. Put the spring in and you will see that the suitcase is damaged first. Good morning, may I? You can still give me some information. Won't you meet two young men? A tall one like me, dark another shorter, blond, with glasses that they always go together. 18, 20 years old. American pants, curls on the neck ... Black and white loafers. - Yes. Do you know them? - No, they are all the same. Typical exponents of the new generation. They are everywhere. Can I see that German dock? Fear nothing, it's good. Dammit! As I caught them ... - Problems? - They tried ... steal my car. - But they will see. - A taxi? - Totaly new. - They are crazy! How can you steal a car today? It is something that could be tried in 44, 45, 46. ​​It could even be tried in 49. But today! With the new and promoted police. A car is not stolen today! - Do you have a radio? - No. Fans, my dear sir! Fruit of war, burned generation. They do things to do them, without need, or encouragement, or technique. - How much? - All new? 3,000. 3,000 for a dock? Spring and hook. And the workmanship. So you don't know them? No. I avoid certain people. They make me sad. They are dangerous to themselves. What if he catches them? To jail and learn. They will learn to steal seriously. A generation burned. They don't love work, they don't apply. They believe in the black market, in adventure. While life is hard, daily, continuous effort . - Okay, 3,000. I need it tomorrow. - At 10. What you say, but me before anything else, ... report them. - Letterhead of 100 lire. If you buy it before you save a trip. 100 lire letterhead? To make the complaint. It is normal. Good luck. - Five nationals. - 100 lire stamp paper. - Lazio should hide. - We don't come second either. Give me a cigarette, come on. How much stamped paper? - Stamped paper? - Give me five nationals too. Soft. - 5,000? - And because you're on my side. Today for less than 10,000 they do not. And where do I get them from? Watch this. A new car. But now pass him a cloth ... - Leave me alone! - No. - And the complaint is underway? - I'm on that. How, you haven't done it? You've seen? It's okay to be cool, but a bit of responsibility, for God's sake. They could be murderers instead of thieves. And don't steal this. But the 5,000 lire is up to you, eh? - I listened. - Where is he going? - You can not pass. - I'm in a hurry. - It's urgent. - Calm! Yes, yes, okay. Hey, are you crazy? Have you seen how it has braked? Your wait. Come here. I've been looking for you for ten days. You don't escape me. - Who did you take me for? - Come on, this time you don't run away. - Have you seen what he's done? - What happens? On top of that, it destroys my bumper! And it gets like this! He drives like crazy, I tell him. Everyone has seen that it has stopped hard. Sure, he was going to run one over. It has saved him by a miracle. And what do you know? He has come down to be your witness. He stopped to talk to the lady. I have seen it. Can not? Don't you talk to your witnesses? Do you know them? Enough already. He has left the car in the middle of the street. The card. Of course, whoever works is always trampled on. And he who does not have an occupation ... I do. I work as much or more than you. I am an official of the Caja del Mediodia. Well, it's after noon, he should be working. What are they laughing at? The damages are paid by him. I have witnesses and their license plate number.

Three rooms, kitchen and terrace. In Via Giulia, Plaza Colonnette, 35 A, if you don't mind. Plaza Colonnette, 35 A. Very good. Please. Imperial forums? - Yes, Trajan, Trajan Forum. - Yes, imperial forums. This section is the Trajan forum, built by Apollodorus of Damascus. And there is the Ulpia basilica and the Traianei market. Ah, wonderful. - What do you say? - You don't know anything about anything. That's what George admired so much , but here it says Forum of Caesar. And what will this know? Forget it and read the guide. You are wrong. The forum of Caesar is near the temple of Venus, ...fool. - Say it again. ¡Tonto! - And what is that? - The Basilica of Massenzio. And there is the Colosseum. The Colisseum! Speak English. Thank you. How much is it? - A thousand lire? - Give me a thousand lire. No sir. There are 500.

He has even done mercantile. - Good result. - You can say it. - And I love him very much! - Even! - Yes. - Well, marry him. If great. He's my brother. Who, that one? Do not you believe it? I'll prove it to you. Come home. They are there. They are the product of war. A generation burned because no one has led them, who believes in adventure and the black market. And life is a daily effort, a continuous effort. Listens. I could tell you the first day But I didn't want my father to know . He is older, an artist. It would be like hurting a creature. Was I wrong to avoid displeasing my father? - Who says that? - Am I wrong to love my father? What's up, you're doing very well. If I had my father ... You're very good, I knew it. Thank God. - No goodbye. Come here. - Where we go? To your house. To Plaza Colonnette, 35 A. Are you crazy? But if you have given me reason. That's why I want to talk to your father. - You don't understand anything. - Goes up! Or do you want your brother to end up in jail and drag you with him? Do you want to end up like this? Thanks a lot. Brunetto. Take a look at this car. Both. It's okay. I'll take care of it. - You've seen? - What wheels! They are good wheels. We take them now. They are from my father. He loves suitcases. - Didn't you say he's an artist? - A traveling artist. - Who? - It's me, dad. Come. Father. Someone wants to talk to you. - Who's the boss? - Hello. But I know him. Yes? I think not. Lina, what do you think this is, a radio or a cinema? Electrical mechanism , that is clear. And the wheels turn. You. Understands? - No, what is it? - A mystery! A mystery from the mechanical world. And where have we met? That's what I was thinking, I'm sure I've seen him. But it does not matter. - What I want to tell you ... - Where did the military go? A little everywhere. In the war. I also. But in another. - Already. Well, listen ... - You're right. His face is not unknown to me. Ah, in the races, in the horses. Nerd. Does not matter. Do you have a coffee? Yes, I do, I do. No, Mom. You go, Lina. Well I would like to know what is this long thread. This is not a plug, this is not a socket. - For you the sugar aside. Voucher? - Yes, dear, thank you. It has to serve ... - How hot, right? - Tremendous, ma'am. What could this be? Yes it's hot, mom. But it will get better. The press says a storm is coming from France. - I've read it too. - Truth? Good... And are you interested in furs, leather, suitcases? No. What I wanted to tell you ... Dad, I want to tell you something. Forgives. Here, leave it there. Do you really think that French storm will come ? - Father! - But what do you want this young man from me? How do you know it? I've known him for years. Don't you remember I told you? No. Do you work with Toto? I don't want you to frequent those people! - Yes, I know. - Did you tighten it well? Yes. That's one that courted me. I have been telling him no for years, and he has nothing. What a story! Every time he left the house, he was there. And once to drive him away I told him: "Hey, I have a father who ..." No. "I have a brother who can break your face." And so he calmed down. And later? Well today I met him again . He was very nice. I say: "How are you?" "Well, it's over. Shall I take you home?" Since my shoes hurt me, I said yes. And why did you? Why... as I wanted to be nice I told him to go up. Hey, excuse me, I think I know what it is. Come a moment. I have hit a button and the wheels have started to turn to the other side. We are! And this is ... what they put in the squares to talk. Ah, the microphone. It's a tape recorder. - Sees it? Look at it. -Yes. - This is how it stops. -Yes. So it comes back and recharges, and so it can be heard again. It is crystal clear. The "Stop". And here the "Go". It is underway. Talk, talk. - She fell asleep. - No way. He does not stop sleeping. - The coffee. - Lina say something into the microphone. - Sing. - What I sing? Sing #Bingo, bango, bongo, I want to # #irme to the Congo. I do not move. # #Bingo, bango, bengo, whatever it is # # I'm not leaving. I stay here. # What a wonderful device. You have brought me luck. At least I bring it to the others. Because I ... How much did you pay for it? It was a bargain. What really attracted me was the case, the color. Do you believe in colors? - Is the coffee good? - Yes, it reminds me of my mother's. My mother made coffee ... Lina is magnificent. For the rest too. Wash, cook, iron ... We try to make her a good housewife. It is wonderful. Very good very good. When he entered I felt, those things that feel, as a beneficial flow. What do you work on? - He is a taxi driver. - A magnificent profession. So many people arrive, people in a hurry, distracted people, tourists full of suitcases. I really envy him. What's up, he's been awful lately. Would you let me? They are Norwegian slippers. Thank you. If not indiscretion, how much do you earn? It depends. Some days it goes well, others ... You can see that he likes home. Yes. Look, really ... I came here for ... - For me the house is an island In this crazy world This is mine. #Parva sed apta mihi #. - Do you know Latin? - No. Does not matter. Dead language. You have to know the modern ones. Which ones does he speak? - None. - Very well. Better this way. Well, I said that this is my house small, but it lacks nothing. Good view ... look, look, the Gianicolo, the Tiber, Regina Coeli ... Father! My family can't stand the sight of jail. I do not understand why. Seeing it from here gives so much peace and security. Sometimes I open the window, I look, I make sure the jail is there, and I breathe easy. The problem would be if the perspective changed . See my house from jail. But like this ... this is how a symbol: The jail, my house, and the river in between. A symbol that is a warning. - Excuse me, I'm sentimental. - No, what's up. - He's a magnificent young man. - Thank you. I'm the one who thanks you for coming to meet some old men Young people today are selfish, they leave us alone, they do everything between themselves. We are on an island ... In an island. - What have you done? - It was the spare wheel. Come on, going. Come quickly. Leave her right where she was. I whistle like this. Well, Mr. Stroppiani, I'm retiring now. I have loved meeting a great person, like you. Today it is so rare. - I wanted to tell you something ... - What? But we better leave it. - You're leaving now? Stay a little longer. - Yes, let's have a glass of anise. After coffee ... So we see together how the recorder works. I also want anise. Yes, mom, you too. How much can something like this be worth? - Come on, let's hurry. - One thing is missing. - He has a house full of things. - I pick them up. - Manias. - I don't mean the suitcases. I mean everything. It's very good. If you are interested, come, come see. Look at the bathroom supplies ... - Well, goodbye. - How? - I accompany you. - Why? Paolo has his job. We have already wasted too much time. Good. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Mother! - If you need me, S. Teodoro garage. - Good. - Thank you and goodbye. - Bye Bye. Goodbye, and don't give up. Well, are you happy? San Teodoro Garage. See you one of these nights. Come find me and let's go to the movies. - Fanatic. - The caresses on the neck ... Come on, go! But what did that guy want? In order not to know how to read or write, I have played his organ. Mother! How many times must I tell you that theft is degrading. A thousand lire! He believed that taxi drivers earned more. - Kids, get down from there! - It's new? - Yes. - Why does he have a bump? I'm going to give you a hit. Hey, hey. His wallet has been dropped. Oh my! Thank goodness. I have my card inside. Good thing you have seen it. Stroppiani House hides, but does not steal. I know where we have met. About ten days ago. They tried to steal his car. In that workshop. Is right! I listened, I listened, will be the destiny. I didn't want to tell him anything but you are such an honest person . Look, I was ... - I'm talking about your oldest son. - Brunetto? It will be Brunetto. I will not file a complaint, but I wanted to warn you. But my son Brunetto is 9 years old and is in fourth grade. 9 years? He is in his twenties. I was with another. They tangled up his daughter and they tried to steal my car. The other Sunday. Wretched! I knew it! It was her! It was her! What a liar, what a scoundrel! But I kill you! - I kill you! - Come now. Who was? Who was that brother? Was it Toto? It sure was Toto. Don't I have a brother? We are crazy? I don't have a brother, if not two. And that? Fortunato, I'm coming. Well, I have one too many. That's enough! That's enough! Tell me what you did or I'll kill you! You will end up in jail! You will end up in jail! - You disgust me. - Oh me? If you! You gross me out, okay? Who has done anything to you? Let's be clear. No useless chatter. First, was your car stolen, yes or no? No, okay? Because you couldn't. First I speak, then you. Let me talk or I'll get mad and it'll be worse. - Oh yeah? - Yes! Good. Nobody stole anything from you and you go around tormenting people. Second: You say I don't have a brother and I happen to have two. - But if you told me ... - Will you let me talk? I want to be clear. I just want to be clear. I have a brother. Two. Third, Whether my brother's name is Toto or Brunetto it doesn't matter. If he was my brother, you wouldn't report him, but since he's not ... If something had been stolen from you, you would have reported it, brother or not. Since they didn't rob you, you were a hero: "He's your brother, I won't report him." What a moral is that. Sure you gross me out. First: You are a liar. Second: You are a braggart. And if you have something to say, say it. But do you hear it? I hear it, I hear it, of course I hear it. Yes, Lina chooses her companies wrong , Okay, but the reasoning is valid. - Daughter, you have convinced me. - Oh yeah? Do not be late. I finish with Fortunato, and we eat. - I'm coming, dad. - And leave Termini station? Now in the Ostiense two rapids stop. Well, if only to change. At home were my parents, 2 grandmothers, a great-aunt, 4 brothers ... - I already know it. - And when they spoke at the same time they did not get to put my head like you alone. Go away. Don't stay here for a minute because I become a murderer. And I don't even want to see you in photography. And who has looked for you? Who? Have I gone looking for you? Tell the truth! Be sincere once in your life. Just once. - I shit ... - Are you going to blaspheme? Dammit! Who disgusts you? And give him that I hit you. Of course... give me the same. Although for me, it's over. Cross and line. Enough! - How many kilometres? - 340. But don't you see what you've done? - You've destroyed everything. - Leave me alone. Sees it? She is gorgeous, like you. - Hello. - Get out of here. - Weren't we going to the movies? - I said go. Go bewitch another, here is leftovers. Can't I chat with your friends? - What's wrong with talking for a while? - You do not mess. - Stop mistreating the lady. - You have no right to be jealous. I'm not jealous! What have you told them? Nothing! What is my fault if when they see us together they believe that? What do you think? What? Paolo, either you leave it or I'll break your face. - It will be possible! - Sorry, it's my fault. I should have told you what I came for. To bring you the 5,000 lire to fix the car. - What? - Dad sent them to you. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon! - Miss, I apologize for him. - We are sorry. He's half crazy. Why are you getting involved? Don't you know who that is? I see who you are. - If you even took the money. - 5,000 lire. But how... Lina, wait. Come here. Come here. Listen, I don't want anything from you. I want nothing. Just don't show up again because if you don't, Damn, I send you to jail, or you to me. It's okay. - As you say? - That you are right to humiliate me. What do you say? Who wants to humiliate you? Well yes, because I know, what do you think? I know what my destiny is. Goodbye. - What do you mean? - Let's leave it, it's better for you. No, when you start talking, you stop. What destiny? The one with women like me, doing the street. Spend the night in jail. When they are young, someone helps them, pays them. Then they are sold cheaply in ports. But what ports? What do you say? One day they were repatriated from Paris, crazy about alcohol and drugs. I'm going to give you drugs. Leave that hand alone. - Let me finish! - Are you going to keep talking nonsense? Dear boy, What will you know about these things? I, who am already like an old woman and am disenchanted with everything ... - What are you? - Disenchanted. What am I giving you a slap? Disenchanted! I am a thief who will end up in the sewers. And I tell you that you will not end ... - Yes! - No! And don't try to comfort me. That hurts me more than anything. But listen to me ... See? You see it? Dammit! You make me lose the thread by interrupting myself. Do you like cars with this bodywork? The color maybe ... Why are you doing this, Lina? You pretend to be cynical and you are not. You are young, you are smart, you are ... Anyway, you should not be discouraged, react. If you want, I'll be close to you, and I'll help you. It is enough for me that you want. Sure, Paolo, sure! That is why I have come. - You've been slow to understand. - The what? Didn't you say you want to be close to me? Well, let's go to the movies. I haven't even seen the title. What movie is it? I don't know, dad chose her. I think it is "Dangerous hand", right, grandma? Yes, "Dangerous Hand", one of thieves. We shouldn't have brought the children anyway . - Why do women come out naked? - No, they spoil. Who steals like this? - Looking for cigarettes? - Yes, I have smoked them all. - I will buy. - Are you crazy? I have. Also, take. You are a Sky. - I give it to you. - But how are you going to do that? I brought it to make amends. It's a little thing of nothing. Above all is the detail. - But if it's gold. - No way! It just looks like it. I bought it for nothing. If we worked like this they would catch us all. - Good Morning. Are you sick? - No. Why is it late? Well ... I woke you up because I have to go. Good grief, how I slept. - Permission, Mr. Paolo. - Ahead. Excuse me, since you have been disturbed I take the stairs. Yes, take it, Mrs. Palmira. - Have you changed your shift? - Not because? As I heard him come back late last night ... - Good morning, Paolo. - Good Morning. - It's cold, do you want it the same? -Yes. Hey, come a minute. Clara, come see this! - Watch this. - What is it? - You like? - Come on, Paolo. Wow, are you still like this? What happens? It happens that "Bingo, bango, bongo. It's only good in the Congo." - Look how the cigars come out. - Congratulations. - Huh? - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Congratulations on what? Because we are already with "my eternal love". You have understood? No? Take, take. A kiss to dad. And be good. Well, I'm going. Do you know this one? "Bingo, bango, bongo, it's only good in the Congo." - No. - Well, I'll show you later. It is very pretty. That's how you sing it on the exam. #Bingo, bango, bongo. # # It is only good in the Congo. # Have you seen what time it is? Where are you going? Good Morning. Good morning to all. Today the boss was bitten by a tarantula . He says something was stolen from him. - The what? - Something. I do not know? Your problem. What can I do? - Hello? - Miss Stroppiani? It is urgent. - There is no stop here for emergencies. - Who? They look for Mrs. Stroppiani on the phone. - Stroppiani? - Yes, on the phone. You don't have to call her. Tell her I called her. Thank you. Thank you. - Hello? - Hello. Lina, were you sleeping? I wake? It's you? But are you crazy? I don't know what I had thought. Yes, I'm crazy. Whose fault will it be? Hey, I wanted to thank you. I had not seen the most beautiful. - What haven't you seen? - It is true? Lina ... Lina, can you hear me? What is the most beautiful? Like what what? Tell me if it's true. I don't understand anything, imagine. If true, what? Tonight. Why don't you tell me now, since you've written it? How can you not? What a scoundrel. What are you going to do this morning? I do not know. I'm still going to accompany dad ... to Ostense station. - It goes? Who says go away? You have an affair at the station. Goodbye. And you tell me like that? How am I going to tell you? Goodbye. Goodbye. Did you have it? Your dead! Do you know what these jokes are called? What anguish I went through last night. Were you going to be smart about that one? The funny one? I've turned the garage upside down. It was not so much for its value itself, but for the dedication of my wife. It must have been a joke. Well, I have a right to know ... ¡Eh, Paolo! Good afternoon. "How are you?" "Good. " "Where did you get the cigarette case?" "How?" "You stole it! You are a filthy thief! You stole it from the garage boss. But I send you to jail. Yes sir. Nothing, I don't want to hear anything. Goodbye. Cross and line. It's over. " Hey, go call your sister. No this. If he was talking to me. - He's gone, we don't know where. - To the station, with the teacher. I have earned them. You were right to get back in touch. And in taking it to the movies. I did it like that, without further ado. A taxi driver is someone, in his own way. Sure, at first I would not be a supporter. But if not, what? A bourgeois? Those who only write and think while others do. - Do you like the hairstyle? - Horrible. - Do not be bad. - Shame. Good trip. In the background is a wild boar briefcase. Wild boar is not for sale. I wait for the Rapid who is late. Good trip. Miss. Those who arrive on a late train are in a hurry, worried, distracted. And we work with distractions. Good, a taxi driver is someone, in his own way. And also for me, for my profession, I 'm not hiding that a car would be good for me. Fabric and fiber. A traveling salesman. Contents: Used slippers, pajamas, toothbrush. If you don't understand these things, you better get married. Are they interested? Like gold. May I have a present, miss? Pick one up too. You leave them here and there, and who doesn't pick them up? Then they turn around. "With the gunpowder of the Moor, everything shines like gold. " You understand? Arrival on track 4 del Rapido from Milan. - Wait for me at the exit. -Yes. I'll pass the suitcase to you, and you to Fortunato. - Yes Dad. - Come on. Goodbye dad. Permission, permission! We will carry your luggage. The coach awaits them at the exit. This way, ladies and gentlemen. Over here please. Sorry. Are you waiting for someone? - Yes because? - I can't find my husband. I have to find him. Will you take care of my suitcase? - Have you found him? - No. To be outside. He took my suitcase, how nice. - Yes. - Thank you very much. Permission, permission! There is the grandmother. - Dear. My precious little granddaughter. - Excuse me, ma'am. Cares? Excuse me Thank you, you have been very kind. You only pay the quick supplement. - The girl told me. - And the extra-luxury. - Holy God! I am telling you no. - We gamble? I'm not going to go second anyway . And on the train you will have to pay the fine. It will cost you as much as going to the Belvedere. I'm going to ask. If you are not right, I will drive you. The toiletry bag! Carletto! - Valeria! - They took my toiletry bag! Moron! But where have you put it? I don't know there. There was a man in a raincoat. Guards! Where is? To the thief! I was just looking for him. And Lina? - Here, son. - I better tell you, period. Your daughter is a thief! - And we will settle accounts. - I'm in a hurry. - But don't you understand? - We'll talk to Lina. - Move on! - He's cheating on us both. I'm leaving! She is a born criminal. - Wait! - Come on. If not, I take another taxi. I take another taxi. You were there when you gave me the cigarette case. Come, come, come! But where is Lina? There, there. Come on, quick. - To the thief! Scream you too! - To the thief! But can you tell where it is? - Who? - Lina! Where you will be? At home. What a thief. With that a German dock. So this was the mania for suitcases. The suitcases of others! Rascals, you and your daughter! - What are you thinking? - It's over. Let's go to headquarters right now. I am an honest person. Nurse! Peter! Peter! Is the taxi driver injured? - Serious? - No. Is it your family? - Yes. - Sister? Take him to X-ray. Take a good look at his chest and right arm. Then bring him here. - Get out, get out! - Quiet! I said hold on! Quiet. The lady is very brave, see? Braver than you. He is not impressed. Very well. Put it on so you don't get cold. You will be happy now. Poor Paolo. You feel bad? Something must have broken. Do not be silly. And try to get a good part of it. If you have a broken bone, it 's a fortune. - Ah, thank you very much! - Dad is at the Indian embassy. ¿Vale? Come on, come here! - What a nice device. - Never seen it? - I can not? - Please. In the midst of misfortune, there has been luck. By chance my father witnessed the accident. Be still and let your arms hang down . How nice! Paolo, you are very funny. But they are broken, right, doctor? - He's got all his ribs broken. - No, he was lucky. Excuse me, miss. Please. Well, as I was saying, a huge and crazy Indian car jumped on him. Paolo's car was stopped. My father he has gone to the embassy with the witnesses. - But that it does? - Go away! Didn't you hear me? - But what is wrong with him? - Calm down. The car didn't hit me! They are thiefs. I do not get it. It will be because of the blow. Write it down in the part. Send a guard to the embassy. These will put us at war with India. Take it easy! I'm leaving. - The lady has a lot of patience. - Why do you leave? It will be better, given the effect I have on it. Tell him to be calm, that the Indians will pay for everything. Goodbye Miss. And I saw the huge car that was running. - Where? - To the left. - While the taxi ... - It came slowly regularly respecting the right. The voice of innocence. I came because that poor young man begged me to help him Before they took it away The consul says the report states that the responsibility ... it's from the taxi. - I can see it perfectly. Because if we were in India with an elephant and hit another, we would think that we had been beaten and we would ask for damages. But it would be an evaluation error due to to inexperience to maneuver in the middle. Truth? Consul says there are more cars in India ... what elephants. - Here too! But it is something psychological. Tell His Excellency that the victim is someone honest, a poor young man who has worked many years to be able to buy a piece of taxi, just a bit of the whole car. Specifically, the one that has been shattered. So I ask him: What does it cost your subject, who owns a whole huge car like a wagon, be generous to our poor young man? The consul wants to solve it quickly, but he wants to hear other testimonies. Right away! Come on children. Thank you, Mr. Consul. I have never doubted the ancient Indian civilization. Gentlemen, stand up. The consul is here. Good morning, Excellency. Are these? Yes, these are the most willing. I make them accompany them to the Italian police station. What happened, dad? Those Orientals, if they are of race , surpass us by far. - Did you touch this? - No and? High Lord, the Consul. Sympathetic, willing to compensate the damages. - How much? - Whatever, I tell you. He had money in his pocket. How? The light is missing. - Forget this. And so? - All right, I tell you. But we went to the police. - AND? - They arrested the witnesses. To all. Even Fortunato. So nothing! You promised ... I promised you! If things had gone as they should ... But nothing is going as God intended. Look at the press, the world is crazy. You can no longer promise anything. - Let's sell this! - Impossible, it's from the RAl. If they catch someone with this ... #Bingo, Bango, Bongo, I'm sorry # #but I'm not going. I stay here. # #You have brought me luck. # # Thank goodness I'm lucky # # to others, because I ... # They don't buy it because if they find it on top ... - Confiscated and jailed. - How much? From six months to a year. - As for a robbery? - According to what theft. They are from one to six years old. Art. 624 and 625. But forget it. And who thinks so? I have no wood. I better get married. Mr. Paolo! Don't you see the lady is here ? Leave it, leave it. I'm glad to see that you've recovered. - Get her out of here. - Mr. Paolo ... Lady, ask him if an Indian has come, an ambassador, and he has brought it all. I asked him for 90 thousand lire. That's what they told me in the garage. And tell him to deign to thank my father. But are you hearing it? Get her out of here! Don't be like that, Mr. Paolo. And do not leave her alone because she is capable of taking the furniture from the house. I already speak with her. Where is? - Where has he been? - It will be gone. As he has treated her ... Well, better. Ah, are you here? Don't close the door, it's not okay. Do you want the landlady to imagine things? Or do you usually bring girls here? Rather you should close the balcony. Enter the heat and the flies. Go away! What do you want? - May I know? - You told me to come. - Me? - If you! Or was it me? Well, it doesn't matter, one of us said it. And how is it possible that today I have to go, same for a year ... From one to six years ... Well, let me go and we won't see each other again. Well, I'm glad everything went well. With dad we are always calm. So, goodbye. Listens. What is going well? Don't you know what will become of me? Wretched! A ruin, the worst of ruins. They have repaired the taxi, And I'll have to kneel before the boss to get me a job. "Let me work, I swear I'll pay." Day after day, throughout life. That's what you've reduced me to! You don't mean to say you didn't get the money. - Oh my! - No! What money? Who would have to give me money? The Embassador! He agreed with dad, with the commissioner. Insurance. If not, with what face would it have come? Quiet, I will go to the embassy. I'm meeting dad. You are not going anywhere because it is not necessary. But don't let him see your father again. Dad says the same. He doesn't even want me to see you. - How? - Look, I don't feel like arguing. Anyway nobody changes his mind. Let me go so they'll pay you soon. But who is going to pay me? Why? The fault was mine. I did not put the blinker. I spun suddenly! - I turned left ... - See? You do not know. Also, to start ... First, today the rich are never right. Second, the ambassador is Indian. What will an Indian know about turning left, or turning signals? Why do you want to complicate it? Indians are Indian and very friendly. Not to mention that they have the best jewelry. - Listen ... - And above all you're presumptuous! - Will you know more than the ambassador? - Dammit! - So you know ... - I just know that you only tell lies. You don't know how to do anything else. Since I've known you, you've only lied to me. What if your brother, what if the cigarette case ... - Slow slow. - Slow what? What about the cigarette case? What a tough face you have. Well, where did you buy it? I didn't buy it. They gave me. And I can even tell you who. - Yes, tell me. - The owner of your garage. But if he looked for her like a madman. Your boss offered me a cigarette. And then I ... look, I remember perfectly, I was in that cabin that I don't know how you can bear. You can't breathe. - And what else? - And what else? How much history! To show off he showed me how the cigarette jumped. - AND? - Stop. You make me mad. With you everything is a story. What if I do this, or do the other ... And to think that I was so happy giving you a gift. He would give me cakes. Do you hear me? Of cakes! You will admit that with you you cannot reason. Listen, let me ... But will you let me talk or not? - And what have you done so far? - How? I said talk. Speaks. Dammit! Speaks. Paolo, what are you doing? Hadn't we fought? Stop, you take advantage because you know that I like it when you hug me. But I have never hugged you. And what are you doing now? Hey, what is this that you're leaving? You told me to make me angry. - I have to go. - Why? How? When? - Tonight. I hope not ... - But how is it possible? - The contract ... And you don't know for how much? - It's not up to me. - I don't set it. - AND? You have to see how things go. Things go like this ... ... and no more talk. Do you accept? - Paolo, the boy from the garage! - Excuse me, Mr. Paolo. Would you let me? Yes Yes of course. The one in the garage says go right away. I get it. I believe in signs. Do you want to see it? It's the boss who ... Very well! I also have good news for you. Now low. You've heard? I put the ring on you and the boss sends me to call. Do you know what that means? - That today we start from scratch. - Agree. Zero! - And my keys? - I put them in your pocket. - Thank you. Will you accompany me - To the portal. - Why? - Didn't you say "zero"? - Goodbye, ma'am. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr. Paolo. Goodbye Miss. - Bye, Paolo! But look how they left the car. I've never seen a car like this. It looks like a map. What a masterpiece. Don't worry, I leave this one as new. The boss calls you. He has a surprise for you. Ah, good morning. Did they bring me the money? - They want you to give it to them. - Come on! And they want it now. But what joke is this? This is a mistake. They told me they would bring it. They spoke with the ambassador, they asked him for 100,000. Paolo, you are becoming an idiot. You have to give them the money! Dammit. And I had believed it! Be! Calm down, Paolo. When you get like this is when they mess you up. Calm down and be careful! Let's go? What? - Nothing. You said 5. - And it's 5.30. Is right. Now it turns out we have a boss. You organize, you command, you decide. The idea is mine, right? So I organize, command and decide. If it doesn't seem right, bye And let it be clear that I will not take a third. - How? - I'll take half. No socks and that dirty shirt! - What's wrong? - That everyone will look at us in '53. Dad is right, you don't know how to work. Let's go. No fools here. Alejaos! Stupid! - Lina! - Goodbye dad. ¡Lina! - Lina. - Listen, dad. I always do what I want. Tell these to get out of here. - What do you want? - Outside! It's a second. I'll be right back. It's okay. Hi. - And good? - Do you have 200 lire? - Ah, that's why! - Two slushies. It will do you good. Daughter, you are not consistent. You ask my permission to go to the movies, but to go steal a car, no. Who is going to steal a car? Goodbye. Wait me. Lina, come here. Where are you going? Al 53. Bus pickpocketing. What an easy and vile thing. And above with those two. Come on. Today only honest, hardworking people get on the bus . Maybe you steal from a pensioner. I need money, you know that. 100 thousand lire. - You told me 90. - It's the same. And it has to be today. You promised me. And I told him the ambassador would give it to him. - And did you believe it? - Dad, he's like that. He believes everything. So he's a jerk. You have chosen well. Who has chosen? Oh my God! But are we going to kill him with grief? As for that, calm down. I have lived a lot, and of pain nobody dies. It's funny, you could even say that pain lengthens life. Something that has not been deepened, but it would be worth it. So a 53. The Parioli line. If you choose well, a portfolio will suffice. How serious is it? Yes Dad. Then you can go ... ...with me! - Father! - Let me change. -Yes. ¡Lina! I'm sorry, but we're not going to do anything anymore . Goodbye! Dammit! It makes us come here ... Wait. Do you think those two are going to make us fools? Come. You idiot, stupid, cretin! Butter! Subnormal! You idiot, you idiot! A gravedigger! Enough, let's not talk anymore! It's useless. Goodbye! Goodbye, it's over. All finished. Who wants to talk to you again? Ticket. And the pasta? You have forgotten them, as always. They are not here. - These buses. Sorry. - Please... - Look. - Get it, get it. Let go of it, I've seen you. And you still! To the thief! Quiet! To the thief! - But are you stupid? - To the madhouse! Hey, I say! - That's my wallet. - I got it back for him. Take. Calm! What happens? Where is the thief? Ah, is that you? - No, I'm the victim. - He's the victim. - Thieves are those two. - Who? Those two. No, all four. How do you accuse us so lightly? He doesn't know us. I do not know them? What a tough face! Now they will pay for everything: for the station, the car, the cigarette case. Guard! - Guard! - What happens? - A theft. Burglars! - I'm the nocturnal one. But he is a guard. Take them to the police station. I start the service in an hour. And that? Do I detour the bus? Come on upstairs. - In an hour we are all prisoners. - Please. Everyone to the police station! Elsa, we are going to take a taxi. No! They have to come to the police station. - For what? - To declare and clarify everything. With him and her. - What does it say? - You will see. Relax, I'll take care of it. Don't let those two run away. They are the thieves. - But where is the police station? - Near here. I know where it is. I apologize. What a world this is! And how about night watch? Does he manage? With good will you are pulling. - And is it possible to enter freely? - Yes, with a request. Have you not noticed anything? Beware of pasta. - Look, Paolo! - Where are you going, Paolo? Miss. But what a lady! I caught the four who tried to steal my car. But isn't she your girlfriend? What a girlfriend! Come on, let's all go to the police station. That the taxi drivers we leave the skin. - Let's go! - Come on! And how about the pension? - After 30 years ... - Give me the pasta! - Why? - Because if! There is a broken step. Ma'am, watch out for the step. But it has many advantages. The night, the loneliness, the silence ... How have I not thought about it? Deep down, an ex-combatant ... - The stairs are heavy. - Tell me about it. They are cream. If you wear them like this, of course ... - For the dogs. - No, I wore them like that. - It's a complaint ... - Wait a minute! Things in order. We have to speak with the commissioner, to whom we will make a complaint. Advertise us, please? Say it's Professor Stroppiani ... and friends. He's busy, they'll have to wait. Sit down. Sit down. I need the commissioner for Rosconi. - Did you instruct him? - Yes, and make it quick. - And watch out! It is understood? - Yes sir. - You take care of the matter. - They must wait. I'm sorry. I have not seen anything. Who do I report? Exactly, my friend. If you want my personal opinion, This is an unfortunate mistake. They will not listen to him. He is the thief who uses the daughter, imagine what indecency. A father who uses his daughter to attract fools like me, or like you. And those two are the buddies who work in shifts. - But tell me ... - Calm down. Calm down, if we were all of the same opinion, we wouldn't be here. - Truth? - The cappuccinos. Here are the cappuccinos. Who are they for? Well, leave them. Although we will want something more. Ma'am, do you want a drink? An orange juice. - I an infusion. - Orange. - And you? - A creamy one. - Beer. - So, 2 oranges, infusion, beer and creamy. Coffee, Lina? - Thanks Dad. - And them? - Coffee. - Coffee. - Carajillo. - 4 coffees. These are getting cold. For us. 4 coffees. Tome. He said that it is natural that each one thinks one thing. But when talking about theft, the question arises: whose profits? To who... is it useful? How much was in the wallet? - Tell her. - He was carrying 120,000 lire. And checks for close to a million. Crossed checks, fortunately. What does it say? Those are also charged. Sure they are charged. Lost, no doubt. And to think that there are young people with 100,000, even 90,000 would solve their problem. - What are you saying? - Nothing. I confirm. I know you were looking for 90,000 lire and there were 120,000 there. Don't you see what he's up to? He wants to imply that the thief is me. Everyone knows how it works. The girl looks at the fool this one itches, and while, the other ... This is the second time you have accused my husband. - Yes. - You heard, Michele! And you have nothing to say? So is it true, pig? At your age! But I ... I ... Listen, miss, tell me, I beg you. Have I allowed myself? I haven't even looked at her. Speak up, miss. It is no surprise. I've been putting up with it for years, but it's over. - Do not be ridiculous. - You disgust me. Ma'am ... Put it there, son. Understand it. Look, I'm much older than you It could be your father, your older brother. Why do you want to listen to these insinuations? Reflect and listen. Your husband and I are in an identical situation. He is accused of indecent assault, and I of theft. Accused by someone who doesn't know neither reflect nor listen enough to think: will I not have something to do in all this history? Can it not be that by those tortuous roads chosen by the dart of luck to hit? Shut up already! You will talk about darts to the commissioner. You do not understand anything. Put down the cup. Take your time, ma'am, like me. Why do you want to compare yourself to this pig? If I knew what the hell of a life ... I got married when I was 18, ... a flower, my lord, a flower. - I believe her. - Here it is. - Orangeade, right? - Yes. - Elsa, please, do not be ridiculous. And why do you get involved? - What does he want? - Me? - Yes! - How? Can't you see this is a trick To pretend? The thief is him. - Me? - He had the wallet in his hand. I surprised them, raised the alarm. I caught them in flagrante! In short, who do we denounce? It is not easy to agree. - Infusion for you, right? -Yes. Good, Lina. Beer and creamy. Serve yourselves. Or do you want a waiter? - Orangeade for me. - Silence! What happen? Nothing, we wait for the commissioner. But we will be back. If it's not urgent ... He was leaving now. Yes, it is urgent, very urgent. I ordered a cappuccino. Good Morning. There is no cappuccino. An orangeade? Allow, Professor Stroppiani. What is this, a bar? What are you doing here? I have brought them to report a robbery on a bus. - Line 53. - Who reports? And the thief? It's not very clear. It is crystal clear. Who are you? We know each other? I think so. Documents! The collector called me, but I didn't see anything. I called him! Speak up when asked. And are they thieves too? Yes sir. Two more thieves. They wanted to steal my car a month ago. - Come now! - I don't even know you. Silence! And who are those? - Taxi drivers, commissioner. - Yes sir. - To serve you. - And what are they painting here? Mr. Commissioner. They are friends of my boyfriend. - And you? - My daughter Lina. Thank you. - And good? - Paolo, come on. Tell the commissioner what we've come for. An unfortunate mistake. Sugar? And that young man has not even noticed. No, dad. Paolo isn't stupid, he knows what he's saying. Of course I know it. I know it very well. - Have you been robbed? - What does it say! Yes! - No, they robbed me. - What do you want? I saw the robbery and I'm doing my duty. And then there are those two, by the car. - You had the wallet. - I took it to give it to him. It is true. He gave it to her on the spot. We all saw it. It was a gesture of honesty. Because it was packed. And Paolo needed 90,000 lire today to pay for the car fix. No? It has been very honored. It has been up to the task. I would have kept it from him. And who do you want to report? Paolo wants to report them all, especially me. He says it's better if they lock me up. - Are you crazy? - Why? - Absurd. - Witnesses. We listen to you. I'm leaving. Excuse me , I haven't seen anything. - What about me? - Wait a minute. I was not on the bus. Don't see gravity? I've called them to testify for the theft of the taxi. In the past. Dear, we can declare about your past. You are the most good and honest person in the world. And the proof is today. I should thank you and give you a percentage. I dont know... Me? To this? Sure, 10%. The law says so. Of course, of course. But if the thief is me ... Are you the thief? Ignore him. I have seen... Silence. Go ahead. If the thief is me, as Paolo says , he who receives the percentage And I'll be glad to go to jail How much is for simple theft? According. - Up to six years. - Good. Paolo, a time locked up. So you will be calm. - But what do you say, miss? - And he shut up. It has no heart. Boys. Let's recap. - You say she's the thief. - No, I say ... The lady is not the thief. Good. She says you are not the thief. And I believe him because thieves have a very different face. - Who is Paolo Silvestrelli? - Me. Come a moment, please. Whoa, whoa. You can finally speak what you want. Happy? Whoops. - Paolo! - Fear not, you are in good hands. As I was saying, he is not, Neither did the lady, nor think about it. You are the witnesses him, the night guard. And who are the thieves, those two? Drop that. - Those two? - I haven't even seen them. Well, you are the victim, and she is his mistress. So who is the thief? Justly. It has been a missunderstanding. We have wasted precious time. We are a bunch of uncivilized. It is not a robbery because he has his wallet. No ma'am? I'll talk at home. - Then lets go. It's hot. -Yes. Exact. Please miss. Thank you. - We just need to solve this. - The what? - 10% for the young person. - Don't make me laugh. - The law never makes me laugh. - I'll take care of it, calm down. - And the drinks? - They belong to the commissioner. The Prati police station. I remember it, during the Allied occupation. What black market is he talking about? That is Pietro Silvestrelli, I am Paolo. - I was in Brindisi. - Paolo Silvestrelli! - He had a truck for others. - With contraband. Potatoes for the carabinieri. - Potatoes for the carabinieri? - I had potatoes for the canteen. - Paolo Silvestrelli does not know. - Do you? Already. Guys like you always have excuses but they end up at the police station. - 580. - What do you want? Have you heard? Paolo, they released you! How happy I am. Come here. Lina, I should give you cakes. - Give them to me. - What do they want? - How much are the onions worth? - 55. Too expensive. - Excuse me. - Walking. I should give you cakes. I get it. Hurry, they're not looking. - What a shame. - What did I tell you? Yes. Although nowadays nothing surprises you anymore. You. Why does it get in? He is my husband and he can do whatever he wants. - I thought ... - Don't believe anything. It will be better for you. - This is crazy. - Do you let this one cow you? - Me? - "East"? Does my husband tell you what to do to his wife? - Stop it! - Shut up now! It's okay. I see you let others trample you. - Me? - If you! But can you give me that cake? I deserve it! - You said I'm your husband. -Yes. I am your husband! Bravo. At last.
