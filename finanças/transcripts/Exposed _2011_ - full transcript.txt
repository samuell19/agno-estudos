- Hello? Can anyone hear me? Is anyone out there? Hello? Can anyone hear me? Help! Someone help me! Interesting choice of angle, gentlemen. - First rule of show biz, Ms. B, give the public what they want. - And the first rule of my class, Josh, is complete the assignment as instructed or you get an "F". Come on, you guys. What is this? You were supposed to shoot a game. - Wait, there was a game? - Yeah, what do you call this? - This is not exactly what I had in mind. - So we juiced it a little. You know, any loser can shoot a football game. What we're doing here, this is fresh, you know? This is... This is outside the box. This is art. - I see. Well, you're gonna have to forgive me for being so uncultured. I'm disappointed. - Really? - Really, guys. I know you think this is cool. And I grant you, you've done a very slick job. But when it comes to visual media, you really need to understand the power you hold in every choice you make. Just by the angle you've chosen to shoot, the subject matter you're focused on, you've completely sexualized these girls. - But you do understand these are cheerleaders, right? - What I understand, Josh, is that this is grossly unfair to these girls. It takes skill and talent and athleticism to do what they do, and you've trivialized all their hard work and turned it into a cheap thrill, Josh. - Come on. - No, I need you to understand this. You see babes. I see bright, hard-working young women who deserve much more from you than this. OK, look, guys, the subject matter I assigned was football. I wanna see football, OK? You wanna suffer for your art and get an "F", totally fine, that's your choice. But if not, there's another game this week. My suggestion is you go and you do it right this time. OK. - Hey, Ms. B. - Hey. - I was hoping I could talk to you. I wanna discuss my project. - OK. There's nothing really to discuss. You can do it again or you can get an "F", but it's up to you. - It's not fair. Do you know how long we worked on it? - This wouldn't be a problem if you'd done the assigned work. - When am I supposed to do this? I already got 2 papers to finish and midterms to study for. - OK. You can have a week extension. But that's more then fair. - I shouldn't have to do it at all. - All right, that discussion is over. Be grateful that I'm giving you an extension. You pull a stunt like this in the real world, and odds are your boss isn't gonna be so understanding. I'm doing you a favour, OK? Excuse me. - I'll do you a favour, bitch. - I beg your pardon? Did you have something that you wanted to say to me? - Thanks for nothing. - Help! In here! Help me! Is there anybody out there? Please... Please... Help! - You do realize how seriously maladjusted that is, don't you? - Sorry, it can't be helped. See beautiful woman, begin salivating, stop thinking. - Thinking is highly overrated. - What's with dinner? I thought I was taking you out. - I had kind of a stressful day, so I thought maybe we'd stay in. - I have reservations at Umberto's. You know how hard-- OK. I guess staying in could work. Not that I'm complaining or anything, I'm just curious. What brought this on all of a sudden? - Do I need a reason? Can't we just be spontaneous? - No, spontaneous is good. I can do spontaneous. I thought you could. - Morning. Coffee! You're a saint. - It's the least I can do. Do you have time for breakfast? - I can't. I gotta swing by my place to change. I have to meet up with Justin for a few hours. - You do know it's a Saturday, right? - I know. I'm sorry. - Does the word "workaholic" mean anything to you? - I'm not a workaholic. I can quit anytime I want. But if we want this little business venture of ours to be successful, now is not the time to slack off. - I don't think you have it in you to slack off. Just don't push yourself too hard. - Well, I've already had one failure. It's not something I wanna get in the habit of. - That wasn't your fault. - Well, you see that's the thing about failure. Once you're near it, you know, the stench sticks with you. And investors have a keen sense of smell. - ... So do I. I think you smell... ...fantastic. You know, if you moved in, then you wouldn't have to go home to change... and we could have more time. - Well, your argument is very convincing, Ms. Bennett. Hand me the phone. I'll call the movers right now. That's Justin. - Ignore him. Go away, Justin. Go away. What are you doing, Justin? Spying on us? - Where else are you gonna be this time on a Saturday morning, sweetheart? - Sorry, declined. - What are you doing, Justin? - It's important. I mean this is truly, actually, really important. Is Andrew there? I've got great news. - What's going on? - Sorry, no good either. - This... - Maybe you could just pay cash? - Em, can you... Just hang on. Give me one--one second. Just... I, I'm gonna be, like, 50 cents short. So I'll catch you next time? - I can hardly wait. - Thank you. It's Warren Morrow. I just got the call. We got ourselves a meeting today. And since it's the weekend, it'd be really great if you could come. - That is great news. - What's up? The key to guys like this is to show a little attitude. And why not? We got the goods, right? Without us, they've got squat. - Aside from, like, 3 billion in investment capital, you mean? - Once again, sorry if we kept you waiting. - We're running late, folks. I think we should get started. - Yeah. So, will, Warren be joining us? - We'll call him if we need him, OK? - That's--that's... OK. - So what sets the U-Know platform apart, what distinguishes us from your standard user-unfriendly software, is, um, a self-screening interface that quickly adapts to the-- - OK, guys, thank you very much. I think I get the picture. Yeah, but did you wanna see-- - Thank you, Andrew. - You're a talented programmer, Andrew. Shame about Paradigm Systems. Don't worry, I know that company went under because of poor marketing. The product you designed for them was excellent. I should know. I bought the patent. It's currently one of our bestsellers. Now, it's not the quality of the program that concerns me, it's the necessity. Which is why I'd like to hear from Emily. I understand you're a teacher. - That's right. I teach media studies at Fieldgate High. - And this program was your brainchild, I believe? - Well, it was a collaborative effort, really. - Of course. But it is a platform specifically designed for teachers and students, is it not? All right then. Would you use this software? - OK. Let me ask you this. Do you remember how stressful it was when you were preparing to take the SATs? - Don't pitch me, Emily. Just give it to me straight. - Yes, I would use this software. - Why? - Because it identifies areas on the SATs in which a student is weakest. - Aren't there lots of programs out there that do that? - There are programs that give sample tests and they show a student areas that they might need help. Our software is more like a virtual tutor. It'll detect a weakness and then it will generate a very specific lesson plan customized to each student. It also has the ability to learn. It processes study habits and patterns that might indicate a more serious learning disability. It does all this for a fraction of the cost of a personal tutor. - Good enough. Let's have legal draft a letter of intent. Let's get this thing rolling. I wanna take you to the trade show next month in Vegas, see what happens. So you've got 3 weeks. - Thank you, Mr. Morrow. - Not so fast. I wanna make sure it can do what you say it can. - Yeah, not a problem. We can get a few of Emily's students to take it for a test drive. - I wanna be clear. If I don't see significant results, the deal is off. Any objections? - None. - All right. From now on, just call me Warren. - Um, Warren, there is one small thing. We actually don't have... - Office space? - Yeah. - I'll set you up right here on premises. I'll give you the offices, equipment and software engineers you need to get this thing done right. Unless there's anything else, I think we're done here. Welcome aboard. - Thank you. - Well... Yeah, I know. - You guys, thank you so much for helping out today. This is Andrew. This is Justin. They'll be running the tests, so try and be patient with them, OK? - Um, and remember this doesn't count for anything at school, so there's no need to guess or cheat. Go ahead. You can begin at any time. - I just wanna thank you guys. We really appreciate all your help. - No problem, man. Anything to help out a teacher that fine is fine by me. - You wanna focus, Lewis? - Yes. - Morning. - Hey, Lewis. - Yeah? - Isn't Josh supposed to be doing this with you? - You didn't hear? Josh is still pissed at Ms. B for making us redo our project. - That guy is such a loser. - You guys, these results might not count for anything, but your behaviour still does. - You're still here! - Hi, Karen. - Hey. - Yes. I've been so busy working with Andrew that I'm gonna have to burn a little midnight oil to catch up on my classes. - How's that going? You're not wealthy enough to quit here forever yet? - No. No, not yet. You know, I don't think I'd give up teaching though. I might transfer to the Riviera, but I would teach. - Well, let me know if you do. I'd make an excellent TA. - I wouldn't have it any other way. Don't stay too late. - Good night. - Good night. - Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, sweetie, it's me. I'm just leaving. I think I'm gonna call it a day, but call me when you get this, OK? OK, someone mind telling me what's going on? - Emily, a word, if you don't mind? - These are fakes, plain and simple. This is not me! I didn't pose for these photos. This is a camera trick of some kind. Trust me, with digital photography nowadays-- - Emily, stop. I believe you, OK? I know what an excellent teacher you are. I have no doubt that this is just some kind of prank. My guess is some kid you gave a failing grade to is out to even the score. But this doesn't change the fact that we have ourselves a problem. Theses photos have gone viral, Emily. I doubt we could find a kid on campus who hasn't seen them. - What are you not telling me? - I'm not happy about this, but I'm gonna have to have a substitute take over your classes for a while. - You're suspending me? - More like a leave of absence, pending an investigation. - But you said yourself, this is a prank. - Yes, I did. But school policy on this is black and white. It's just until we figure this out. Now, this is just as much for your well-being as it is for the school. - I don't believe this. Do you have any idea how unfair this is? - Yes, I do. It couldn't be more unfair. But the moment these pictures went out, was the moment my hands were tied. I'm sorry. I truly am. There's nothing I can do about it. - Finish the chapter, everyone. Um, I'll be right back. Emily? My God! Are you OK? - Karen, that's not me. That's not me in those pictures. - Of course it isn't. - Who would do this? Who would do such a thing? No, no, no That doesn't make sense. We're backpedalling again. We already looked at that. - We gotta go back. - Hey, what are you doing here? - No classes today, Ms. B? - Can I speak to you, Andrew? - Sure, yeah. - Sorry. It'll just be a minute. - We got a deadline here, guys. - Yeah, OK... - What's going on? - Take a look. - What the hell is this? - Given that they've already been circulated throughout my entire school, it turns out this is grounds for temporary leave of absence, pending further investigation. - I don't understand. - Well, it's very simple. Someone has made an entire collection of photos supposedly showing me half naked. They're fakes, but they're really good. So what I wanna know is, can we take these somewhere? Can we get some kind of professional analysis and prove that they're bogus? - But where'd they come from? - I have no idea. - Well, they're good. Whoever did this knew what they were doing. Did you take a close look at these? - No, not really. Why? - Here, have a look. You notice anything funny? On the lower back? - So let me get this straight, you're saying that that's not you, but it is your face and your tattoo? - Yes. - Tell you what, I'll take them down to the forensics lab and let's see what they come up with. - Thank you. - The pictures are fakes, detective. We know that. What worries me is the tattoo. Whoever did this, how do they know about that? - Are you sure you've never posed nude before? - I'm sure. - The two of you never decided to-- - No. - What about an ex-boyfriend? - You think an ex-boyfriend could've done this? - It's a possibility. At this point, Ms. Bennett, the laws surrounding Internet defamation are still evolving. While doctoring photographs isn't a crime in and of itself, distributing falsified images with an intent to do harm is. So why don't we start with that? With a list of anyone who might, you know... know about your tattoo. Look... take your time, OK? I'll be right back. - Hey... It's OK. It's all right. - No. It's not OK, Andrew. - It's Justin. Warren wants to meet with us in the morning. - I thought we should talk. - I assume this is about the pictures. - Justin brought us up to speed. - They're fake. I did not pose for those pictures. - We're worried, Emily. - Justifiably, I think. - Whether you posed for those pictures or not, this could easily turn into a PR nightmare. You were gonna be the face of that new software. If your credibility is suddenly called into question, we could be facing a disaster. - Disaster. Absolutely. - You're right. I think I should pull out now and sign my shares over to Justin and Andrew. Whatever. They have nothing to do with this. - That's probably the best thing to do... for the good of the company, of course. - Absolutely not! This whole project wouldn't exist without her contribution-- - Excuse me. Can I continue? You have to understand that I have shareholders to report to. - We filed a police report. They sent the photos to a forensic expert. We should get results in a few days. Until then, I guess you're gonna have to trust me. - Fine. We'll continue as planned until the results come in. We'll make a decision then. - Good idea. - But make no mistake, if this is going to be a problem, we won't be going forward with you. I'm sorry, Emily. I really am. It's just business. - Creepy! - Yeah. Whoa! - You believe this place? - I don't think we should be in here. Come on, let's just go, OK? - Come on, don't be a wuss. Let's go this way. - I don't think we should go in there. - Whoa! Look at this! What is it? - My God! - Man... - Is she... dead? - I don't know. Maybe. I think so. - Hey, you don't have to do that. I would've brought you your stuff. - I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't wanna run and hide. - You're absolutely right. - I guess that's it. So... - Hey, Ms. B, how you doin'? Looking for some fresh meat? - Ignore him, Emily. Ignore him. - I'd be happy to take some private lessons. - One more word, Josh, and you'll have detention for the rest of senior year. - It's OK, Karen. It's OK. - You guys should be ashamed of yourselves. What's happening with Ms. Bennett simply isn't right. - Hello? We need to talk. - We have a meeting with Warren in, like, 5 minutes. - Don't worry this won't take long. - What's going on? - The bank called. - There were insufficient funds in the business account for some cheques that were issued, and they're taking the money out of my personal credit line. - What? - Amazing week, you guys. First, I get suspended from my job, then my name gets dragged through the mud, and now this? - What did you do? - What, you didn't know? It takes 2 signatures on a cheque, Andrew. I haven't signed any. - I signed a couple of blank cheques. You said they were for normal development costs. - I put $30,000 into that account. Do you have any idea how long it takes to save that kind of money? - We all put money in that account. I needed an advance. So what? - An advance? - Yes. I have expenses too. - It's a business account! You guaranteed me that that money would only be used for developing the product and that we would make the decision together as a group. - She's right, Justin. You can't go around making decisions like that without discussing it with us first! - Relax. We close this deal, we'll get it back 50 times over. So let's not make a federal case out of this. - I don't believe this. I... - You guys ready? - Warren! 100%! - I'll meet you in the boardroom. Hi, Emily. - You have to fix this. Today, Justin. - I will. Don't worry about it. - Yeah, how you gonna do that? Where are you gonna get that money? - I'm gonna take care of it. This isn't the end of the world. Emily, Emily, just wait. - What? - I'm sorry, OK? It's just, now is not the time to start rocking the boat with Warren. We discovered a bug in the software yesterday. - Why didn't you tell me? - With what you've been through, we thought it best not to. - It's a glitch in the source code of one of the filters. Fixing it won't be a problem. Finding it in time for the trade show, that's what we should all be concentrating on. - You should have told me. - Thanks... so much. Emily... Emily, wait. - He's your friend. You said he could be trusted. - I know, I know. - You need to fix this. - Help! Help! - Amy, it's OK. It's OK. Sweetheart, sweetheart... It's fine. It's me. - Bryan? - It's OK. It's me. It's over. It's over. It's OK. It's OK. - No, it's not. We need to call the police. - There's a couple of officers just outside. - I need to speak with them now. - What? - The man who did this to me, he's going after someone else. - Andrew? Andrew? - What can you tell me about the intruder? - Like I said, I couldn't see his face. It just happened really quickly. - Height or build? - I don't know. Average. - I contacted your former boyfriends, and they all checked out fine. So, now I think we should start looking at students, coworkers, parents, anyone you think might have some kind of a score to settle. - A score to settle? It's hard to believe that I would know someone like that. - Ms. Bennett, you're a high-school teacher. Whether you believe it or not, I'm sure there's a student with something to prove. - OK, there's Josh, I guess. But I just don't think he'd be involved in something like this. - This Josh have a last name? - Williams. - Anyone else who may come to mind? - I don't think I know anyone who's capable of this. - I understand, but I also need you to understand. Doctoring dirty pictures is one thing, but breaking into your house while you're here, that's something else entirely. - What do you mean? - It's not my intention to alarm you, but this is a clear escalation of aggression. A crime like this, Ms. Bennett, typically it's not about sex. It's about power, intimidation, control. - What are you saying? I'm dealing with some kind of psycho? - What I'm saying is that we don't know. But we have to look at everyone. Now, so far, we haven't found any signs of forced entry. You're sure the door was locked? - I thought I locked it. - Do you keep a spare key outside somewhere? - No, I don't. - OK, so assuming the door was locked, who, besides you, has a key to your place? - Just Andrew. That's it. - What about a landlord or someone in your family maybe? - No, I own this house and my family's in Detroit. - And just out of curiosity, do we know where Andrew is this evening? - What are you getting at, detective? - We have to look at everyone. - I know Andrew. There's just no way. Why would he do something like this? - I'm not saying he did. But as I'm sure you can appreciate, it's my job to consider every possibility. - I don't know who did this, but it wasn't Andrew. I'm willing to bet my life on that. - Emily, Emily... Are you OK? What's going on? - I must've fallen asleep. I'm sorry. - What are you doing here? - My house got broken into last night. - What? - I needed a place to crash. - Are you OK? - Where were you? I must have called you 20 times. - I'm so sorry. The battery on my phone died. I grabbed a bite to eat. I didn't get home till late. - I swung by your place at 1:00. - I--I don't remember what time I got home. You know what? To hell with it. I'm gonna take the rest of the day off. After everything that's happened, the only thing that matters is looking after you. - No, you need to focus on work right now. Let's just get this project finished. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm OK. I'll call you. - OK. - Hello? - Ms. Bennett, this is Det. Costa. I just wanted to follow-up with you regarding Josh Williams. -What did you find out? - He was at the hospital visiting his dad at the time of the break-in. Um, well, that's good, I guess. - At least it narrows down our list of suspects. Are you busy right now? - Um... Not particularly. Why? - I was hoping you might be able to join me in D.C. this afternoon. There's someone there I think you ought to meet. Emily, this is Det. Nolan. She's in charge of an investigation I think might be of interest to us. - Pleased to meet you, detective. - Her name is Amy, and what she has to say may be hard to hear. But for now, we'll just listen. - It was a really terrible week. Bryan wanted to take me out to dinner to get my mind off things, but he got stuck in a meeting. I was about ready to leave, when just all of a sudden, it was like the world started spinning. I thought it was from drinking on an empty stomach. When I got to my car, it didn't take me long to figure out that somebody had spiked my drink. After that, it's just mostly a blur. - Tell us about the pictures, Amy. - It was about a week before all this happened. It was awful. These degrading photos of me circulated around my company's email. - But that was just the beginning. I mean, the guy who did this, he actually broke into our house. Amy was there. She was doing laundry in the basement when he broke in. - Tell them what happened next. - He left more photos behind, right there on the kitchen counter where I couldn't possibly miss them. That's how it started, you know. Those pictures. Is that why you're here? - Yes. - Do you have them? - That's my face, and somehow, he managed to superimpose my tattoo. But I promise you, that's not my body. - Yeah, I can tell. - How? - That last time that he came to me, just before he just left me there to die... he told me that it was goodbye and that he had found someone new. It's you, isn't it? He's coming after you? - Det. Nolan has given me what they have so far. Do you have time for a coffee? - Sure. If it concerns me, if it concerns my case, I wanna be kept in the loop. - You have to understand, any information I share at this point is strictly confidential. There's been a few developments. First, we found what we think might be 2 related cases. Different jurisdictions, but they're both within an hour of the city. - What makes you think that? - Same MO in each case: photos, break-in, more photos. - Are the victims OK? The girls? - He seems to be escalating the level of interaction with each vic-- girl. Amy seems to have gotten the worst of it. - That's not all. It turns out they're all in software design, in one way or another. And Amy, we've learned, temped for several firms in the business. - And so you think that because I'm in software design, I fit the profile to a tee? OK, I get it. He's coming after me. What am I supposed to do? - Between Baltimore and D.C., we've got more than enough detectives working this case. I assure you, we're leaving no stone unturned. Look, I appreciate this is a lot to absorb. But now I have a favour to ask of you. I want you to lay low for a little while. I don't want you telling anyone where you are. - Is that really necessary? If we're trying to catch this guy, won't that seem strange to him? You know, maybe tip him off? - Our first priority's to keep you safe. I think that's a chance we have to take. - Fine. I can stay with my friend Karen. No one would think to look for me there. - Thank you. Give me Karen's address. I'll have a detail parked outside by the time you get there. - I need to swing by my place and pick up a few things first. - Be quick about it. He's never struck during the day, but I don't think we should take any chances. - Don't worry. I don't wanna be there any longer than I have to be. - Emily, trust me, we'll get this guy. - How come you didn't tell her? - Tell her what? - That Amy used to temp for Paradigm Systems, the same company her 2 partners worked for, not to mention, one of those partners is her boyfriend. - Because she's right about tipping him off. If our guy is one of those two and they find out we made the connection to Paradigm Systems, they'll change it up and look for a new victim. - I just think you're taking a big risk using her as bait. - I think it's our best chance to catch him. Hell, I think it's our only chance. I think it's worth the risk. - I hope you're right. - Lewis! What are you doing? Trying to give me a heart attack? - Sorry, Ms. B. I didn't mean to scare you. It's just, I've got something. It might help you out, is all. - Yeah? - There's been a whole lot of talk about you at school. I'm sure it's just the same old losers spewing garbage, but... - Spit it out, Lewis. - Apparently there's this website, and you're on it. I just thought maybe you should know. - Josh! We need to talk! - I got nothing to say to you. - I think you have a lot to say to me. - Stuff it, bitch. You're not my teacher anymore. Wait, you're not anyone's teacher anymore. - That's just fine. You don't wanna talk to me, you can talk to the police. They have some questions for you. - Look, I'm not involved, OK? - Is it true? Is it true about the website? - Yeah, but I didn't create it. I just forwarded the address to a few friends. - Then who did? - I don't know. - What are you telling me? Some stranger just sent you the address? - That's exactly what I'm saying! It was there one day in my inbox. - How'd they get your email? - I don't know. I have hundreds of online friends. It could've been any of them or anyone they know. - Come on, Josh. I want a name. - I don't have one, OK? When I replied to the sender, my message bounced back. - Give me the address. - I don't have one. It's just a number! That's all it is. Look, we're talking dedicated website, OK? Only way to know is to find the number, then go straight to it. - So far, we've accounted for 9 fibre-optic cameras and 6 mikes, all fed straight to the Net using a piggybacked broadband. Very slick. This is a camera. This is a mike. Pretty high-tech stuff. - OK, I want you guys to look at every square inch. We're looking for anything and everything. Fingerprints, hair, whatever you can get, OK? - How long has he been doing this? - It's hard to say until we have our computer guys take a good look at everything. We'll find him. We're working round the clock on it. - Hello? - We have him on the line. - Ms. B, you there? - He wants to talk to you. - Hi there, Ms. B. How nice of you to join us. We've been waiting for you. Not the bathroom cam! Come on! What's the matter, lady? Where's your sense of humour? Anyway, just wanted to say goodbye before they unplug the office cam. It's been a slice and everything, but all good things must end, right? - Why are you doing this? - What do ya know? She speaks! Good question. I think the answer has to be, because I can. It's the beauty of cyberspace, you know? Where else can you be everywhere and nowhere all at the same time? - Wow. You are really something. - Please, don't even bother. What, you think you can draw me out? Maybe let some dipstick cop whip up some kind of profile on me? - No. I think you're a sad, pathetic little man who hides behind his-- - Let me tell you what I think, bitch! I think you haven't even begun to imagine what I'm gonna do to you. Those pictures at school, who cares about those? They may be fake, but these ones aren't. And guess what, sweetheart, I've got hundreds of them. You shut this site down, so what? Thousands have seen these pictures so far. But believe me, it's not gonna be long before we're talking millions. And so it's goodbye, Ms. B. I'll be seeing you. And when I say, "I'll be seeing you," I mean, I'll be seeing you. - Hey, sorry to bother you. - Don't worry about it. What's up? - A detective's here. He's wondering if he can see you. - Sure, why not? Everyone else in the world's seen me already. What's the difference? - Hey, it's all gonna be over soon. - I hope so, because I don't know how much more of this I can take. - Look who you're talking to. If you can take a classroom full of high-school seniors, you can pretty much handle anything. - Yes, but I can put them in detention when they give me trouble. - Look on the bright side, at least now you don't have to eat cafeteria food. - True. Thank you. I needed that. Thank you for all your help. You've been such a lifesaver. - Don't even. I wouldn't have it any other way. Let's go. - Yeah. - Our computer forensics department determined that this so-called Watch Emily was charging a subscription fee. It turns out people were paying good money for the privilege of spying on you. - This just gets better and better. - Well, the good news is, the techies ran a check from the site to the Web host. They managed to track down where the money was going. It's a numbered corporation registered in the Caymans. Now, there's no way to tell who owns it, of course, but here's where we got lucky, or someone got sloppy. - I don't really understand what all that means. - OK, well, yesterday, there were 6 transfers wired from a Cayman account into 6 accounts in the US. One of which just happens to belong to a Mr. Andrew James Gray. - I... I can't believe that. - That's not all. I haven't been entirely honest with you. There's something else you should know about Andrew. - I'm listening. - Amy worked for Paradigm Systems. - Andrew and Justin used to work there. - Yes, we know. I realize this is hard to hear all at once, but you have to trust me, Emily. I'm telling you for your safety. - Why don't you just arrest him then? - Until we subpoena his bank statements and prove our theory, everything's circumstantial. - Theory? You're basing all of this on a theory? - I wouldn't put you through this if I thought there was a chance that we're wrong. - It's Andrew. He says he knows you're here. - Don't let on that you know until we know what he wants. - Hey. - Well, hey, yourself. You're talking to me. That's a step in the right direction. Are you all right? I've probably left you a hundred messages. - I'm OK. -I'm worried about you. You just disappeared. Why didn't you tell me you were staying at Karen's? I had to call, like, 20 people before I found you. Emily? - Um, the police thought it would be safer after the break-in. Andrew, what do you want? - I wanna see you. I wanna help. I wanna be supportive. - Yeah, I think I just need some space right now. - Emily, I don't know what to say. I tried to apologize about the money. I had no idea Justin was gonna clean out our bank account. - I really don't wanna talk about this right now. - Look, I'll say it again. I'm sorry, OK? - Andrew, it's not the right time. - OK. OK, fine. Well, if I can't talk about us, can we at least talk about business? There are things we need to discuss, things you need to be a part of. We found the bug. The software's ready to go. Warren has asked to meet with us tonight. I think he wants to get things finalized. Emily, did you hear me? I'm talking money here. - I heard you. - This is everything we've been working for, isn't it? - I don't know. I don't know. - What? - There's a meeting tonight. He wants to talk business. Can you believe that? Everything that's happened, and he wants to talk about money. - You don't have to do this. - I'm tired of being scared. I need to stand up for myself. I'm gonna go to the meeting. What's this? - We can't follow you inside the building, so it's just in case we lose track of you. He's not gonna try anything inside the Morrow offices, and we'll be waiting right outside. All units, subject has entered the building. Keep this channel clear and stay sharp. - Hi, you've reached Andrew Gray. Please leave a message. - Andrew, it's me. I'm here. Where are you guys? Hey. - Hey, yourself. - Um... Andrew told me that we had a meeting with Warren. - I didn't think you were coming. - I'm still a partner, right? I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back. - Emily, wait. We haven't had a chance to talk. I feel bad about what happened with the money-- - Let's just get through this meeting and then we can sort that out later, OK? - Hey, Emily, you forgot your purse! Emily! Emily, wait! Emily! Emily! I think we need to have a little talk. Let's go back to the office. - I have nothing to say to you. - This isn't what it looks like. - Yeah? What does it look like? - You have no idea what's going on. You don't know what's at stake, so let's just go back to the office. We can talk there. Just... Emily! Emily! Emily! Emily! Emily, come on! Emily! - Emily! - Warren! I'm so glad to see you. It's Justin! The whole time. The pictures, the website, it was him! - Calm down. I'm not following you. - I have proof. I'll show you. Come with me. - Tell me about this proof you say you found. - I found a disk in Justin's bag. It has pictures and graphics. It has everything. Look. - He had this in his bag? - Yes. - Here, drink this. - Thank you. - What about Andrew? Do you think he's involved as well? - Well, we did at first, but now... - Who's "we"? - The police. They're downstairs waiting for me. - Well, then we need to go talk to them right away. - I think that's probably best. - Come on. Whoa... - You OK? - I don't know. - Justin, what's going on? - We got a problem. - Wait. Where are we going? - The parking garage. I thought it would be safer if I drove. - Those are our guys. What are they up to? - I don't get it. It says she's still in there. - All units, there's movement at the front entrance. The subject is still inside. Nobody goes in until I give the signal. - It's the black one right here. Are you OK? - Yeah. - You knew and you didn't say anything! - No... - Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don't know what the hell's going on, but I think it's time we find out. All units, move in. I repeat, move in. - Do you have any idea what you've done? Any idea? You idiot! - Andrew Gray, Justin Reynolds, stay where you are. Stay there. Calm down. Relax. Hey, hey ,hey! Calm down. Relax. - If anything happens to her, I swear to God, I will kill you! - Where is she? Where is Emily? Where is she? - I don't know. I don't know! - The monitor says she hasn't moved. It says she's in the southwest corner of the 14th floor. - OK, go. Take a look. I want these 2 guys to stay with me till we figure this out. - I'm sorry, OK? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt anyone. - Calm. - Sorry. - You know what? I think I should walk. I think the fresh air's gonna do me some good. - I'm not sure that's such a good idea. - Yeah? - She's not here. I found her purse with the tracking device, but she's gone. - She's not here. - This son of a bitch knew. You knew she was in danger and did nothing! - Enough! That's not what I care about right now, so knock it off. Come on, come on, come on. - I don't think you should answer that, do you? - You knew, but you didn't say anything? - I just found out, like, 2 days ago, OK? - How'd you learn about it? - By accident. I was looking up coding protocols in the Morrow Group databank. I was looking for a solution to the bug in our code. And I came across something that didn't fit. It's a website design. So I checked it out. Next thing I know, I was staring at Emily. - This was 2 days ago. - Why didn't you come to us? - I wasn't supposed to be there. I hacked into Warren's personal files. I was worried about the deal. And I just... I thought if I could, you know... If we held on for a few more days... I didn't wanna blow the deal. Not to mention, possibly being arrested. Look we need this, OK? Without this, we are done. We're busted. I mean, do you have any idea how much money we're talking about here? Brilliant. - I don't understand. - Sure you do. It's easy. The first time we met, the first time I looked into your eyes, I wanted you. And I always get what I want. - Emily? Emily? Hello? Hello? Yeah. I want you to run a trace on the last call that was made to my phone. No. Do it now, dammit! - God... - Tell me, Emily, what is it that you think you know? - I think that you are a sick and twisted bastard. - I've known worse. I was gonna let you sweat it out for a few more days, you know? But what the hell! It's always fun to improvise. I must admit, Ms. B, I am gonna miss our intimate moments together. I like to think that you secretly knew I was watching you all the time. But now it's time to take our relationship to the next level. - No! Not gonna happen! - Yeah? I have the coordinates from the cell trace. - Go ahead. - The call originated at the corner of Harrison and 11th, sir. - Copy that. Harrison and 11th. - Book these two until we can figure things out. You two guys come with me. Let's go. - What do you think? Have you gotta rethink your position here, sweetheart? - They're gonna find you. You know that, right? Someone will find you. - The cops? Are you kidding me? No. I'll tell you exactly what they will find. They're gonna find money bouncing all over the damn place. And when they finally track it down, they're gonna find it dumped, all neat and tidy, into your sweet little boyfriend's bank account. Nice touch, don't you think? Change your mind yet? I, for one, think you and I would make an excellent couple. I don't know how long it would last, but believe me, it'd be exciting. One sound and I blow your head off. - You think you can buy your way out of this? - Shut up! Not one word. - Or what? You'll shoot me? - You're damn right I will. - You do that, and you will have the cops down your throat in one second. - At least I'll have the satisfaction of knowing you're dead. - At least I'll have the satisfaction of taking you with me. - Emily! Emily! Get an ambulance! She's been shot! Go, go! Stay with me, Emily. - Hey. How you doing? - I'm OK. - I got you these, but look at this. Never knew you were so popular, did you? You know, the press, they're all over this. Even now, there's a horde of reporters camped outside. Is there anything I can do for you? - I'll be OK. - When you're feeling up to it, I think we should talk. - Yeah. I should really work things out with you and Justin, but I don't really feel like talking about business right now. - It's not that. It's about, um... Never mind. We can talk later. - I'm sorry. I should have believed you. - It didn't help that Warren was trying to set me up. - I should have trusted you anyway. - Anyway, um... We can talk about all that stuff, maybe when you're feeling better. I should let you rest. I just want things to be like they were before this all started. I don't know if that's possible, but that's what I want more than anything. - Me too. Vision Globale
