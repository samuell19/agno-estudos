Dad? Wake up. Dad, wake up. Get up, Dad. It's too early. No. Let me sleep. I'm as hungry as an ogre. I'm warning you, if I catch you, I'll eat you! Where are you? Nina? Where are your clothes for today? They're on my bed! I'm changing your shirt. This one's dirty. OK? OK! Good morning, it's eight o'clock. First up this Tuesday in Haiti, UN peacekeepers are once again caught up in a sex scandal. According to a study published by the New York Times, hundreds of children have been born by rapes committed by UN peacekeepers and subsequently abandoned. Honey? We're leaving in five minutes! Can you help me with my pants, Dad? EDITORIAL BOARD You put them on backwards. Hello? Yeah, I heard. What? You mean, go there? No, I can't do that. Ask Julie. She knows the region well, too. Yeah. I have to take my daughter to school. See you later, Arnaud. There we go. And Mrs. Aurore taught us to count to 100. That's great! Let's go. You all right? Yes, Dad. OK. Shit. ARNAUD EDITOR THINK ABOUT IT, PLEASE. IMPORTANT UN PEACEKEEPERS RAPE HAITI HUNDREDS OF UN PEACEKEEPER BABIES IN HAITI, HUNDREDS OF BABIES ABANDONED THE UN FACES ANOTHER SEX SCANDAL HAITI MAP OF PORT-AU-PRINCE All these memories. I'd stopped dreaming of them, but they always end up floating to the surface. My darling, these words are for you, for the day you'll want to know your story, our story. Back then, I didn't have any idea what to do with my life. I never imagined that you would be born on the other side of the world. Excuse me. Have a nice day. -Hello. -Hello. ID, please. -Here. -Thank you. -Mr. Vanhoestenberghe? -That's right. Window number six. We'll call your number. -Have a nice day. -Thanks. -Hello. -Hello. I see you've turned down several offers, the last one being a communications and marketing job for Nexius Bank. Communications and marketing is up your alley, right? Not quite. I studied journalism, and marketing is different. And I don't really know anything about banks. I understand, but it would help you pay the bills... Temporarily, anyway, until you can figure something else out. I'd love to find you a journalist job, but I don't have one. Do you know the rules? If you don't find anything in a month, you'll lose your insurance. Yeah. How did I hear about that volunteer program for the UN? I'm not sure anymore. There were lots of former students looking for adventure. Any job would do. So I figured, why not? It's pouring out there! Mom, what are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood. I saw that the door was open, so I figured I'd pop in. Coffee? Please. I have an envelope from your auntie. She's been insisting I give it to you for months now. That's nice, Mom, but I don't need any money. Then do it for your auntie. How's the job search going? Honestly, it's rough. They keep offering me stuff in banks or communication... It's not what I want to do. I didn't study for five years to end up at a bank. I understand. I feel like they mix everything together these days, but you'll find something. You're going to find something you like. Take care of yourself, and... It's not good to be alone all the time. Now that you have the time, go out, do things. Don't worry, Mom. I'll be fine. OK. Dear Mr. Vanhoestenberghe, we are pleased to inform you that you have been selected for a journalist position with the United Nations in Haiti. Congratulations. The UN Volunteers programme. Yes! You don't want your aunt's money? No, it's not that. I just heard about Haiti. I got the UN job. In Tahiti? In Haiti, in the Caribbean. -Do you realize? -I heard! In Tahiti. It's far, but great! Will you be here for Christmas? No, I won't. -Bon voyage. -Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen... It was a new world to discover, and there was so much good work to be done. I was 30 years old. Life was finally giving me a chance to play my part, to contribute something. WOZO A FILM BY THIBAUT MONNIER Papa to base. Papa to base. Papa 2k139 here. Regarding transport of cooperation. As you know, we have three security levels in this zone. The first, Level One, is the lowest. Level Three is the most dangerous. Here in Port-au-Prince, you're at Level Three: the red zone. We have 15 contingents of UN personnel in 14 countries. That's about 2,000 soldiers total. We also have 600 UNPOL. That's the United Nations Police. And we have 1,500 civilian personnel. There are also 21 UN agencies working in this country. In total, that comes to nearly 7,000 people. Haiti is unpredictable. If you are in danger, say "emergency" three times on your radio. If you hit someone with your car, you drive away and go to the nearest police station. I've saved the best for last: the evacuation plan. It could be a hurricane, an earthquake, or a political crisis. And in this charming country, anything can happen. So you have to have a 30-pound bag with all the necessities with you at all times. OK. Thanks for your attention, and welcome to this charming corner of the Caribbean. This is where my office was: the Log Base, a fortress where UN peacekeepers rubbed elbows with sunglass-wearing expats. Every day, I heard the ballet of UN helicopters and planes. Peter. How's it going? You must be Boris? That's right. -Welcome to Communications. -Thanks. We've been impatiently awaiting you. Dieubon, communications manager, and Frantz, the webmaster. -Welcome to Haiti. -Thank you. -Here's your desk. -OK. OK? I'll be brief. Besides the peacekeeping mission, we deal with cholera, AIDS, communitarian violence, and the fight against poverty. OK? For each one, we have projects that are financed by France, the US, and Japan. So your job is to write about those projects and make them visible. OK? -Sure. -You're with me? We need photos that show not only progress but also the problems with the projects. -OK? -OK. Your weapon. Your ammunition. Don't waste any bullets. Everything you shoot is for this office. OK. Fire at will! I had so awaited this moment, but it was even better than I had imagined. I had access to the entire country. My heart would pound every time I climbed aboard one of those old Russian helicopters. We're here at an important commercial intersection between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Every Monday and Friday, thousands of Haitians and Dominicans meet here, in the town of Darabones, to do business that greatly benefits the national economies. This market brings hundreds of millions of dollars a year to each side of the border. So... Since the start of the program, we've planted about 300 hectares. OK. We're hoping to be able to double that, and what's even more important is that we've created 400 jobs. And just with women and disabled folks. Make sure you put that in your article. OK. Can I get an interview with that lady? Sure. No problem. -No problem. -OK. OK, we can start. Frantz, can you first thank her for receiving us at her home? He thanks you for welcoming him. So, first of all, can you explain how you joined this reforestation program? She's a charcoal saleswoman. One day, she was working in her field when a white man came and told her about the program. That's how she got involved. And how has this work changed her life? She says that when she sold charcoal, she made more money. But you know that it's illegal to make charcoal? The program only lasts two months. She says the program is only for two months. OK, but if there's no more trees, you can't make charcoal. We'll leave it there. Thank you. I'm just going to take a photo for the interview, OK? He wants to take a photo. Nice photo. It's not too much? A good photo should hurt. Healthy folks are for shampoo ads. You know the project is only for two months? Yeah, unless we get more financing, and that's the kind of photo we need to get it. And then? Then, what? They'll go back to their old lives. They'll go back to cutting down trees? Did you think it would be for life? Presenting these people as saviors of the forest, when they're responsible for deforestation, is nuts. Can't we find something long term? Thanks for your input, but we do communication here. So focus on what you know how to do. You're working for the UN, Boris. This is serious. -So you want that photo? -Yeah. Did you do the border project? Yeah, it's good to go. OK. FROM CHARCOAL TO REFORESTATION Hello. Can I help you? Hi. I have an appointment with a Dr. Medgine Seraphin. Let's go to my office. We will be more comfortable there. So, firstly, you can go over the current cholera situation in Haiti. As you know, cholera is a serious intestinal infection that can be fatal within days without treatment. Cholera was almost non-existent in Haiti until there was an outbreak in 2010 caused by Nepalese UN peacekeepers. Today, it's a huge public-health issue. But the anti-cholera program you work with here at the hospital is funded in large part by the UN. How does this partnership help you? This partnership, as you call it, brings us financing to fight against the problem that was imposed on us. Contamination can occur orally or through fecal matter, transmitted in drinking water or unclean food. That's how the Nepalese peacekeepers brought cholera to Haiti: by defecating in our rivers. Do you honestly think that this center would be having such a big impact without international backing? Of course not. But I can assure you that we wouldn't need all this money, since we wouldn't have a cholera problem in Haiti if your peacekeepers hadn't brought it. I think that the United Nations should at least acknowledge their responsibility for this situation. Look, Doctor, I'm not here to argue. I'm just trying to document the situation. Were you at the Secretary General's press conference last year? Because I was. In a fifteen-minute conference, you know how much time he spent on the cholera issue? Two minutes. Two little minutes. Meeting your mother was a shock... because of her character and her commitment. She'd seen her fair share of idealists like myself who had come to advertise for humanitarianism. She wasn't fooled. But deep down, I knew she was right. I just need my eyes to be opened, and she's the one who opened them. She worked in the only functioning hospital in the city, with very few qualified personnel. Thank you. She handled both emergencies and day-to-day injuries. An all-terrain doctor. Can you tell me about the peacekeeper cholera issue? You don't know? About what? Shit happens. What do you want me to say? 10,000 deaths, and all you can say is "shit happens"? If you must know, no, the peacekeepers didn't shit in the rivers. Yes, they had the virus, but this wouldn't have happened if the Haitian company had done its job and not dumped the waste in the river. Shit. They couldn't check the wastewater pipe? Do you realize what it would mean? The compensation, the real victims, and all that just for some money? Your project on the border is going to committee next week, and I still don't have your report. So spare me the sentimentality and finish the video. OK. Hello, can I speak to Dr. Medgine Seraphin, please? Yes, tell her Boris Vanhoestenberghe called. Thank you. My videos brought in financing for these projects. This job gave meaning to my life. I couldn't question it. I couldn't face another failure. Hi, Jaina. Feeling good, Mr. Boris? Not bad, yeah. HAITI PAP PERI 5-2, dude, I'm wrecking you! White man. White man, give me money. Boris, it's Mom. Can you see me? Hi, Mom, I know it's you. Yes, I see you. OK. How are you making out? You look a little... I'm good. It's good. I work a lot, but it's good. I have good people here. All these stories we hear about kidnapping and voodoo have us worried. Are you being careful? Everything's fine here, Mom. I found a nice little house in a quiet neighborhood. What about you? The grandkids, yoga... I got a new yoga teacher. He trained in India. It's really something else. Incredible. Dad wants to know, as usual, when you're coming back. I'm sorry, Mom. I have to go meet some people. I'll call you later. Wait, Boris. Are you sure your health insurance is all in order? They call me every week. I'll take care of it. Promise. I love you. Bye. Bye. I started to lose touch with reality when your mother and I started seeing each other. Always seeing things through a lens led me to stop seeing with my own eyes. I had lost my critical faculties. I thought I was a journalist, but I was just a communicator. Hey. How's it going? Good. See you. I have seen the report, and trust me, you will love it. We keep getting financing offers. You did a great job. HAITI AND D.R. HEADED FOR RECONCILIATION Hello. Can I take a photo? Thank you. Asshole! Hey, asshole! Bastards! -Bastards! -Take him. Bastards! Let me go! Anika? How's it going? I'm starting with the markets, and then I'll do interviews later. We need images of harmony. We need to show that the countries are reconciling. The US worked a long time on this. We don't want to lose them. Yeah, don't worry. No problem. Let me go! Let me go! No! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! You like this, huh? How you feel now? How you feel now? You like this, huh? Taking this dick, huh? You like it? Take it. Crap! Hey, guys! Usually, a screen puts distance between you. You see, you hear, in films, on the news, online. You find it horrible, you turn the TV off, and life goes on as before. I should have intervened, shouted, screamed. Instead, I watched a life be extinguished without doing anything, without saying anything, not right away, and not afterwards. To think I'd wanted to make truth my vocation. White man, give me money. I love you forever Haiti, Mama darling This is the land where I want to die I was born in a beautiful country That bathes in the Caribbean How I love this land It's so sweet and calm Haiti, such is my name It's pretty and charming Made of gold and diamonds I could never leave it Haiti, Haiti I love you forever Haiti, Mama darling This is the land where I want to die Haiti, Haiti I love you forever This is the land where I want to die Foreigners appreciate Haiti When they come here They don't want to leave They love it so much Haiti, Haiti I love you forever Haiti, Mama darling This is the land where I want to die I have big news. Your photos did their job. The US is signing on for another five years. Nika, you're being transferred to headquarters for multimedia. You're being promoted. Boris, I'd like you to be the new head of communications here in Haiti. Me? OK? Sure, of course. -Congratulations, guys. -Thank you. Hi. Hey, how are you? Pretty good. How are you? Not great. What's wrong? I'm having problems at work. What kind of problems? Ethical. Well, go on, spit it out. You know the project I mentioned last week, at the border? Yes. It didn't go as planned. It's a crisis there. People are fighting, and my boss wants me to come up with an ad showing how Haiti and the Dominican Republic are getting along. OK. What are you going to do? I don't know. It wouldn't be a lie to say there's been progress. But that'd be focusing on just one part of the frame and ignoring the essential. What happens if you don't do it? I miss out on a great promotion. But the UN isn't the only employer on the planet, Boris. You're talented. You'll find something else. If I do this job, I'd get 10,000 dollars a month, with a 25,000-dollar bonus. Can you imagine? It's pornographic, but how can I not think about it? I could do it for three years and buy myself a place in Brussels instead of taking out a mortgage. You think it's normal to make 10,000 bucks a month in a country where the average salary is 200 a month? You don't even pay taxes here, Boris. Come back down to Earth. You're better than this. And don't give me, "I work far from home, in difficult conditions." No one's forcing you. The UN is the taxpayer. Open your eyes. It's not that simple. Put yourself in my shoes. "Put yourself in my shoes"? Have you ever put yourself in mine? Or the people you're supposed to be working for here? Do you remember Kish Paul? The people at the bottom, the people who benefit from your "projects." You don't know anything about their lives. The poverty here is what the wealth elsewhere is founded on. The UN believes they're helping like Haitians believe in God. It's ridiculous. Medgine? Patricia? I can't do it. The problem with UNICEF is we always wind up high and dry. I don't know. Figure something out. Check with your supplier. Hang on a second. Hello. Is this communications? Yes, what's it about? I'm the new volunteer. -Oh, shit. Thomas, right? -Yeah. I was expecting you next week. Hang on. Let me introduce you to your new colleagues. Dieubon, in charge of media. Nice to meet you. And Frantz, the webmaster. What's most important for me is images, OK? This is your weapon. OK. And here's your ammunition. Everything you shoot is for the office, OK? -OK. -Don't waste any bullets. Frantz, put him on the report this afternoon. Good luck. Excuse me, guys. I don't know what to start with, but I need coffee first. How's it going? Antonio! -How are you? -Good, you? Great. How are you? See you. The Prince of Monaco is coming to inaugurate two schools. If we want him to be generous, we need to make his trip memorable. Put the whole team on it, OK? For tomorrow, confirm the meeting with the Brazilian ambassador, and don't forget to write the speech. Ah, Boris. I need you to represent me tomorrow morning at 9:00, at a meeting with the government. Sure. What's it about? Debriefing the newly elected officials. The new head of the ministry for the mineral project in Reunion. The goal is to lay out the main range of our future collaboration. -Anything particular to bring up? -It's all in there. Be polite. They're sensitive, and the ministry is under our supervision. We have to maintain a good relationship with them. We'll go over it later. I need the speech in 30 minutes. MINISTRY MANAGEMENT Out of the 5.35 billion US dollars promised for reconstruction in the wake of the earthquake, between 2010 and 2012, just 56 percent, or three billion, was actually disbursed. The earthquake generated a lot of support around the world, yes, but what came of it? Our needs have only increased. Whose fault is that? It's not 2010 anymore, and I can guarantee you that my colleagues and I are ready to move on from the emergency phase if you move us into a phase of sustainable development but one that is self-managed. Do you understand what I'm saying? It's time to reverse the roles here. Mr. Vanhoestenberghe, if you want to work with us, then invest in our policy instead of trying to do it for us. Who do you think I am? The white guy here to teach a lesson? I can't help it if your colleagues in the government are more interested in fancy cars and cell phones than the good of the whole, or if being the cousin of a senator gets you a cushy job. We're past colonization here. Maybe it's time to move on. I tried to put it out of my mind, to convince myself that it was too late, to look the other way. Then I made a choice. The time comes when the choice is clear, when all that's missing is courage. For once, your mother and I were in agreement. She's the one who gave me the courage I needed. Thanks for coming. I hope this isn't about what's weighing on your conscience. Not this time. I'm leaving, Medgine. I don't know to where, but I'm leaving. You're leaving, or running away? I wanted to become someone when I came here. I had it all wrong. We're all in the same boat. Your struggle and mine are the same. What's your advice, then? Stop doing propaganda. I can't anymore anyway. They fired me. What? Why? At a meeting with the ministry, I don't know what got into me, but I flipped out. What'd you say to them? You don't want to know. But it won't be long before it gets back to my boss. You know, I'm just a nobody in the system. Then write about what you've seen. Pull back the curtain. I, the undersigned, Boris Vanhoestenberghe, communications supervisor for the UN in Haiti, declare that I witnessed a gang rape committed by four UN peacekeepers in the town of Manama, as the attached video shows. I would have liked to aid the victim, but it seemed impossible at the time. It is my hope that sharing this video will help justice be done. YOUR VIDEO IS UPLOADING. PLEASE DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW. HAVE A NICE TRIP! News from Haiti, where a rape committed by UN peacekeepers has just been reported by a UN employee, right as the peacekeeping mission has been faced with violent demonstrations against its responsibility for the cholera epidemic. This scandal has reignited the debate over the collateral damage of international aid on this Caribbean island. Haitians continue to call for reparations from the UN for their responsibility in the cholera breakout. You can count on us, Minister. Great. In late 2016, the UN officially apologized to the Haitian people for its role in the cholera epidemic, which has killed over 10,000 people and infected over 800,000 since 2010. However, the UN continues to refuse to take legal responsibility, by hiding behind diplomatic immunity. Other than a bit of indignation, sharing my videos didn't lead to much. Cholera and rape by UN peacekeepers still shows up in the news in Haiti. I still believe that filming means something. I hope that these words will bring you strength every time you hesitate to stand up. Your mom fought to the bitter end. She would be so proud of you today. You are like the reed. Even though you may bend, what matters is to not give in. Hey, darling! How was your day at school? Good. My friend and I played soccer. It was so cool. You played soccer? Yeah. And I play forward. Forward? I had no idea. Lina, I was thinking... What if we went away for summer? Do you want to go anywhere in particular? You don't know? What if went someplace sunny, where it's beautiful and warm, with water everywhere. That'd be cool, too.
