I owe God 5 dollars. Interesting... I'm coming. Right away! Come on, we have to hurry, brothers. I have to go and buy rice at the market. Father, there's something I don't quite understand. Hurry up and tell me. In the current chaos of war, with national disaster hanging over our heads, how should we represent the next generation of China? Brother, who are you? What are you talking about? What can I say? Who am I? Repeat after me. Repeat after me. Understand? Understand. - Every man has a share of responsibility... - Every man has a share of responsibility... - ...for the fate of his country. - ...for the fate of his country. Fend off Japanese bandits and restore China! Fend off Japanese bandits and restore China! Do you understand what I am doing? Do you understand what I am doing? You don't need to repeat that. You're from the Revolutionary Party? Are you a common citizen? I am a priest. Is a priest a common citizen? What are you saying? To save the country, those with energy must expend it, those with money must spend it. I've already done my utmost. What about the money? You're stingy! You're deceiving the revolutionaries! The only thing left here is an IOU! No one believes us anymore; they believe in Japanese empire. Turn around. - Is it hard or not? - Hard. Recite the Bible. - In the beginning there was God. - Louder! Don't you dare stop! In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth. The earth was empty, in chaos and darkness. Then God said, let there be light, and there was. Scoundrel! Since Qing Dynasty until now, there were rebellions all the time. I just can't understand this, why are they rebel since we have enough food to eat? But this is a good opportunity to make a fortune. They say I am the man without dignity; but actually I'm a man without money. Dad says I make money without dignity. I told him: Money talks over my dignity. Dignity is not important. Mister, my sister hasn't eaten for three days She can't keep on singing. Do you know who [ am? Call me Daddy. Hey, you are performing on my territory. First, you must pay taxes. Second, you must call me Daddy. Call me Daddy. You'll suffer if you don't have any skill. Daddy's gonna teach you a trick. Watch and learn. Where did it go? It's in your body. In your body? What are you doing? Don't touch me. This is my territory. - Whose territory is this? - Yours. It's yours. I'm not challenging you. What are you arresting me for? You look like a criminal to me. Sir, don't frame me. 1 think you look like one of them. You all look like criminals. What the heck... Your name? Xiao Dongbei. My Japanese name is Xiaodong-Beizi. I'm from Taiyuan. Twenty-eight years old. Jobless. - You've been through this before? - Yeah, five times. How have you been? Seems like you're doing too well. You've come to pretend to be a revolutionary? Wu Ge? It's fate that I fall into your hands for the 5th time, right? Kneel down! What did you call me? Wu Ge - San. - Can you read this? - Arch-Enemy of Criminals. - So what should you call me? - Arch-enemy! - Of whom? - Of me. So what are you waiting for? Hurry up and explain yourself! Look at you... The trophy is just made for you! One dollar is enough for custody. You have so much money that I should prosecute you. Hold on, Arch-Enemy. That's not right. This dollar is mine. The rest is yours, right? I owed you last time. Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. What is that revolutionary stuff about? I had to pretend to be a revolutionary, otherwise no one would donate money. Alright, keep pretending for another two days. What do you mean? I've got orders to severely punish the revolutionaries. Help me fill the blank, then you're free to go. Wu Ge, don't worry about it. I'll do it! You know what? I'm gonna pretend for two and a half days! That's my man! Give the dollar to the Father. Case closed. Sir, cigarette? Excuse me. Information from NHK: Our Axis friends give us helping hand when we're in the despair moment. The Italian Ambassador, Mr. DeNiro will be soon visiting our city. Bro, this is a movie theater. A public place. That really stinks... So what? You can move if you want to. It's up to you. Fair is fair. Let's go home. It's unsanitary here. Don't move! Sit down! Attention everyone. Sorry to interrupt. I, Tortyama. You all just saw that the Italian Ambassador will visit our country. This signifies the birth of our new country... ...after defeating the white men that tried to enslave Asia. We have already received the recognition and respect of the world. It's for honor. It's for our country. But while we are building the country, there may be a few people who are trying to subvert the power of the government. Should we root them out? There are two of them right here. They're like two rotten apples injuring their neighbors. Disgusting. Nobody move! Nobody move! Bastard, why did you shoot? Major. It seems we've caught one of them. But how to find the other one? Clean it up. Man needs peace as he dies. His gaze will fall upon those he trusted. In this case, the revolutionaries must be in this part of the audience. Let's play a game. Let's see if we can find the coward. An open and poised man walks straight. One with pure thoughts can walk straight, even if he's blindfolded. You walk straight, you get here. Old gentleman, maybe you want to set an example for others. Please. Go. Who is next? Go. Congratulations! You're fine. But he was standing in the wrong place. You can take his place. Who is next? Enough. I'm the one. Bro, we agreed on two days. Don't forget, okay? You poor man. Leave my stuff alone. Don't mess up with me. Cut it out. You won't need these anymore considering your situation. You're a revolutionary, aren't you? - And you? - You don't know me? I'm the chairman of the street gang. Manchuria has too many people like you. No wonder it was taken by Japanese. Every man has a share of responsibility for the fate of his country. I hear this every day. You don't need to teach me. Move your legs. Hey, man, you seem like a decent guy. Do me a favor, ok? Hold on. We're not in the same party. There are great inequalities in the world. I want to... Well, is that a phrase? It's called Jian Xuanyuan. It means that there's too much oppression and inequality in the world. We have to stand out and resist to find a way out. I want to sacrifice myself to wake up the common people. Here's my advice: Money is everything. It's better to live a shitty life than to die a good death. Fate brought us here. I'll give you that clothes as a gift. There's no need to see me off. Goodbye. Leave me alone! This is my house! I don't care whose house this is. Don't shout for help or you'll get killed. I'm telling you, don't mess around. My buddy kills a lot. Hey, man, but I'm not a lot. What the hell are you talking about? 1 told you he kills people a lot. Stop stalling and take off your clothes. Now! I've got no money. We don't want money. You don't want money? Hurry up! Shoes! Quiet! How dare you stir up trouble in front of my house? Dad, they are robbers! Bullying my son is like bullying me. I am Golden Dart 13! As the history goes: Millions of warriors were killing enemies with darts. I'm one of them and I can defeat anyone! - What are you doing? - Watch my dart! You bastards! Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! I'm telling you, don't piss me off. - Gold Sister, it's their fault. - What did you just call me? Didn't you say you were going to pay the rent once you come back? Why are you standing there naked? Excuse me. What are you two up to? Robbery. Any problem? Bye. You've been robbed? Isn't that obvious? - You don't have cash or something? - heroes don't care about money. Shut up. You're embarrassing me. Those two low lives are not qualified to take anything from me. Silver. Is this enough? You're going to hell. This is silver plated. Being washed in my solution, it came off. Amazing! You have magic potions! Beat it! If you don't hand over the rent, don't blame me for kicking you out. What do they want if it's not about money? The gold arrives at Yamato Bank on the night of the 10th, under the charge of Gu Xianming. Stop! Or I'll burn it! - Stop! - Get up! - Relax, man! - Calm down! I can arrange everything. You take this and I'll take that. Well, you're decent. But I haven't paid my rent yet. No, wait! We've got more. Here. I got it. This is worth more than that. How can you be such an asshole? I have a copy. - Where is it? - In my heart. Let's talk. We can make a deal. This is how we're going to talk? What's written on that paper? We split it 30/70, alright? I'll take the smaller share. - What does it say? - Less than 20% is not going to work. - What does it say? - How about 10%? - You're gonna tell us or not? - Not unless you pay me. Fine, forget it. Hold it! The letter from Mu Rong is more precious than treasure. Calm down. If we lose him, the letter is gone. I really can't stand your attitude. Revolution is like art. Without suffering, craziness and resolution, it just won't work. Show some backbone. - We have to solve everything in the way. - Shut up! It's not you that pick up the mess. We have a bucket. You're a barbarian. I can't stand this. It's inhuman. Turn your head the other way. What's the big deal? Don't you worry about disturbing the neighbors? Knife is dangerous. Make sure you know how to use it. He's gonna cause trouble sooner or later. I got to kill him. Camera Zheng, don't forget how hard Mu Rong tried to send us this message. Listen, there are 8 tons of gold. You'll get 10%. What do you say? Eight tons? The gold arrives at Yamato Bank on the night of the 10th, under the charge of Gu Xianming. When the time comes, you'll get your share. Aren't you the celebrity, Fang? If you want to get your payment, you'd better keep your mouth shut. Look at your face. I'm kidding. First things first. Which bank did you say? Yamato Bank. The bank is said to be the most secure one in Asia, designed by Europeans and built by Japanese. It's the main financial support for Manchuria. There are guards everywhere. Trying to rob is like fighting a hopeless battle. Screw you. Don't behave like you're on top of the world. It's silly! Fighting a hopeless battle? I don't think you've got the guts. Let's finish the plan. We've wasted a whole day. You can go in from the sewers. My dad knows every sewers in the city. All of the sewers are connected. The Japanese are smarter than you. They've made the entrances to the sewers so small that... ...not even a cockroach can get through. Think before you speak. What Screenwriter Shu said was right. Once the gold is in the bank, it will be impossible to get it out. We have to strike while it's in transit. Fang has the point. She's brilliant. You bootlicker. Tell me, how can we know which road they are taking? - Who is in charge of the transit? - Gu Xianming. Who is Gu Xianming? He's the boss of Yamato Bank and a man of influence. I've heard he's about to be promoted finance minister. Director, you've got so much information. You must know him. If he knew him, would he be working as a director? We don't know him. But he must know me. We need to take the initiative and go to his house to check things out. You can't leave me behind. I can pick locks and I can drive. Kid, go home. Don't follow us. We're not friends. Understand? Got it. Have you looked at Shu's new draft, Director? Yeah, I read it. It's not bad. It's sad, but I like it. Don't you understand? I'll shoot you if you keep following us. A gun? Troops! Troops! Clean it up first. We'd better go separately. You go first. Let's go. Look, he's drunk. Chinese are helping Japanese, nice guy! Come back with us. Central command is that way. Where are you going? Stop! Is he your friend? He's drunk. Shut up! I wasn't talking to you! Halt! Run! This way! This way! Get in there. I can't. Shit. Search the place. Don't let anyone out. These are pickled cabbages. Oh, no! All wasted. Did you see anyone enter? My cabbages... They're gone. Don't let them get away! Don't just stand there. Help me up, you fool. - Do you know who I am now? - Well, now I know. And? In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth... Every dog has its day. You're brave, man. I'm always helping people out. This is my territory. I have responsibility. Why did you kick me just now? - Because you have a big ass. - You're pretty smart. Xiao Dongbei, be careful with my car. Yes, ma'am. God called the firmament Heaven. We have the night and the day. But now we don't have any cabbage left. Dad, I'm hungry. Being a driver is a big deal. Not to mention a driver for a celebrity. What's so great about it? Well, at least I'll make a fortune. We're staging a revolution. You don't understand. Who says I don't understand? I was a revolutionary, remember? As the history goes... Alright, alright. I'm starving. Let's eat, okay? Corn soup again? Can't you make a proper meal? Noodle soup or something? Noodle soup is no match for sweet potato. I'm about to join the high society. I can't eat this kind of food anymore. What does high society eat? Noodle soup every day. Whatever you say. First, we have to figure out where the library is. Miss Fang is here tonight. Hi. - You're my Venus. - I'm flattered. - Do you mind if we take a picture? - No, of course not. Come on. Excuse me. If there's a chance right in front of you, you'd better seize it. Director. Excuse me. Don't get drunk. Before we come to the matter at hand, let me entertain you a bit. General Yokomichi. Wow, General Yokomichi is here. He's here, finally. Commander Yokomichi, I'm honored to meet you. Miss Fang, I finally get a chance {0 see you in person. And I finally get to see you in person. Oh, sorry. It's a huge honor, General. Hurry up. Here. Did you see that? They say only gods keep cranes as pets. He's astonishingly wealthy. Can I help you, sir? This sword was bestowed upon my clan by His Majesty the emperor. My family has used it to commit seppuku for generations. Fascinating. Let's have a drink. Nice to meet you. Sorry, Miss Fang. It's alright. In fact, I can clean it with a glass of vodka. But Mr. Gu, you have to find a place for me in private. The bathroom is, well, you know... Come with me. This way, please. Please give it up to the rinsing star of the Empire, Miss Lina! Mr. Gu, where are you taking me? I'm taking you to the library. You're really cute. There're paparazzi here. What if they take an incriminating photo? They wouldn't dare. Vodka. On your left. You're adorable. Mr. Gu, how have you been? I don't see any noodle soup. Don't bring that up now. Eat whatever you want. Miss Fang, are you done? It always takes longer than you can imagine for a lady to get ready. What are you doing? You're a thief. - Come here. - What? Zip it, or I'll kill you. What's the matter with you? You want another slap in the face? He's a thief! Catch him! I got it. Don't you try to deny. Where did it go? You want my pants down so you can make a body search? He's a thief, I swear. My son is not a thief. He's a revolutionary. Get out of here! Get out! Stop. What did you say? Mr. Gu. Step aside. Miss Fang, please get ready now. We have to go downstairs immediately. This is it. Miss Fang, hurry up, alright? Take it. Wait. They'll know if we take this. Put it back. - Please wait. - I can't. Miss Fang, I'm sorry but I have to come in. Sorry. - What is it? - There's trouble downstairs. Focus. Now, start walking. Fine, I admit it. You admit it? 1 took the silverware. See? I told you! Thief? You damned kid. Didn't I tell you to wait outside? You're making me disgraced. I'm terribly sorry, Mister Toriyama. He's an apprentice from our troop. - I'm an actor. - An actor? I was performing a trick. The kid is too young. He's made a complete mess of things. What are you staring at? Get out. You shouldn't be here in the first place. Wait. So all of you are actors? Giving me a performance right here? Is this old man also an actor? - Yes, he's a member of our... - You've been talking too much, Miss Fang. You just said your son is... My son is a revolutionary. Not only him. So am I. Fight against foreign intruders for Qing Dynasty! I was part of the Boxer. I killed foreigners. Haven't you heard of Golden Dart 137 I'm telling you, back then we didn't have guns. We fought with knives, you know? As the legend goes: True heroes fight with their bare hands. We burned the allied headquarters to the ground. Jeez... I'm sorry. I was meant to take my father to a nice dinner. He has mental problems. Please forgive him. Sorry! I'm terribly sorry! You have a good son. - What did I tell you? - It not my... - What did I tell you? - I... - What did I tell you? - To keep my mouth shut. That gold is going to be used by the Japs to buy weapons. What will happen when they get those weapons? What will happen to Manchuria? We were almost there. You're doing far more harm than good. Get lost! You've used me and now you're kicking me out? God will punish you! Gold Sister. Gold Sister, just give me a couple of days. It's pouring. You won't let my dad sleep on the street, will you? Listen, Xiao Dongbeli, you're different now. My shabby house isn't good enough for you. Back off! You're doing far more harm than good! - Sir, help me. - What? I'm sick. I need money. You... you... you... Do you... do you... Just get... get out of my way! Don't talk if you can't speak properly. Thank you... Xixi, I've got a gift for you. What is it? My father told me to give you this. It belongs to my grandmother, then my mother. Xiao Tong, I want to ask you something,. Go ahead. Do you love me? Xixi, how could you ask me something like that in broad daylight? It's dirty! Dirty? What's dirty about love? Maybe you can spend your life with someone you don't love. But 1 can't. Your father made a promise to my father. Fine, they can go and make a happy couple. You'll regret this! Sister, how about a flower? It's beautiful. - Thank you. - You are welcome. Watch out! What are you doing? What am I doing? Little shit. You're the actor. No, you're the thief. Do you realize you ruined everything? You're a gangster! Yeah. So what? Run, you idiot! Move! Damn! Mind your own business. 1 don't need you to rescue me. You'd have been killed in the explosion, you fool! I don't believe you have the intention to save others. I saved your life and this is how you repay me? Well, thank you for saving me then. Just turn your face the other way. You're telling me not to pant? I saved an ungrateful overweight elephant. I'll pant if I want to. You're awful. I should've hit you with a brick. You... Wake up! You're awake. Are you trying to kill me? Don't be nervous. The doctor said you've had a concussion. Wow, you are rich. It's good to be rich. You owe me the cost of four... No, five sacks of wheat. I don't have any change. This will do, considering I got the concussion on account of saving you. Don't rush to leave. You really do have money. I'll take your gold necklace. I'm warning you, don't call the police. The doctor said you need to rest. Where... where am I? You're at my house. Isn't this Gu Xianming's place? He's my dad. I think I'm gonna follow the doctor's advice. What did you give me your necklace? You don't have to, really. Take it back. I don't care about money actually. I've got a concussion. I need to lie down for a minute. Do actors behave like this all the time? I behave like this when I'm injured. Can you get me something to eat? Sure. Wait here. Relax and rest. Jiang, do we have fresh honey? Bought some yesterday. Yesterday? Well, what about cakes? Hand it over. Hand what over? Hand over the stuff you stole. Fine. I don't want it anyway. Why do you want my photo? You know, just... Why? I want to keep it and you know the reason. You're making no sense at all. Fine, I get it. You're a rich lady and I'm a poor humble actor. You're out of my league. That's not what I meant. I'm not looking down on you. I've been thinking of you since the moment I first saw you. I like you. Then why did you slap me in the face? Powerful men do that to their wives all the time. It made you remember me, didn't it? Let's put all the cards on the table. Do you love me or not? It's dirty. What's dirty about love? Besides, I'd like to be dirty for you. Don't come any closer! I've ruined your rose. This one will last. I'm getting my share for this. What's essential when you go boating? Oars, right? What's essential when you go fishing? Fish pole, right? What's essential when you go fighting? Weapons, right? My point is, equipment is essential. Dude, it's already noon. I'm starving. Please just bring out the equipment. What's your target? Two trucks. Fifty Japs inside. You have a bold vision. I respect heroes like you. Bring out the American weapons. Great! Great! If you got enough money, I can get you an armored car. Equipment is essential, remember? Xiao Dongbei. Cut! Cut! Why are you here? I brought you some medicine. We're working, for God's sake! The Director said I'm a natural for acting. He must be crazy. Why did you come? Because I wanted to. Wait a minute. Here. They're cheats. You're a fool to give them money. How do you know they're cheats? I just knew it. People like this, eight out of ten are cheats. Well, that leaves two of them, doesn't it? I believe the ones I've run into are not cheats. Don't forget to take your medicine. Brilliant. So this is your armored car. A bunch of stones, for Christ's sake! Fang, I'm a respected person. I've been a producer for years and I've never wasted our money. Camera Zheng, if anyone tries to cheat us, they're definitely not afraid of us getting back. The gold transit will be on tomorrow night. How can we stop the trucks without weapons? There must be more guards than we can ever imagine. It's a long-shot. We've got no chance to win. It's like fighting a hopeless battle. The damned theory again! You're a coward with no hope! Don't lose your courage just now. Let's think it over and talk it through. The Italian Ambassador will be here soon. Once they get the gold into the bank, we won't be able to prevent the arms deal. We'd rather die than watch the deal begin. Die? Is there any other way? Director, do you think he can work with us? We can make use of our own skills. Like shooting a war movie. Use the sounds, lights, props and explosions. At a fixed time and place, we can stage an air raid. What if they don't buy it? That's where actors come in and play their part. Air raid! Air raid! Into the shelter, now! We have a very important mission. We can't change course. Hurry up! Hide! This way! Over here! Put your guns down. Put your hands up. Put your guns down. Put your guns down. Key. Give me the key. Nobody move! Put down your weapons. What the hell! If I made me die, I'll come back as a ghost and haunt you for the rest of your life! You're lucky that 1 shot him. Wow! He's out of ammo. Get him! The bank accountant. She's escorting the gold. I'm sorry. What are you doing? What are you doing? She knows us. If she blabs, you can shoot me again. Go! Quickly! Move! She likes you. Mission accomplished! We did a great job. Fantastic! Are you still going to act? You think I can't be an actor after this? You'd lose your job if I become an actor. I'm taking mine. Xiao Dongbei, we just pulled off a huge robbery, lay low for a while. Once the truck is out of the city, we'll give you your share. Are you screwing me? I told you we'd give you your share, but I didn't say when. Don't worry. I'll keep my word. Xiao Dongbei, you have talent. Have you ever thought of actually becoming a revolutionary? You're revolutionaries. I'm just part of a street gang. We're from different groups. After 1 get rich, I won't take any risk. Do you know why I came to Manchuria? When I was in Japan, I made a mistake filling a prescription. Guess how they wanted to punish me? They wanted me to commit seppuku. Too violent. I believe you hate those rebels as much as I do. So, you should help us. I... I don't know. You don't know? I don't know either. What are you hiding? For the sake of yours and your father's, you got to tell me. Did you see them? Who are they? Tell me! Colonel! This is for Xixi. She accepts it, she's free to go. - But, sir... - Shut up! If Tokyo hears about the robbery, we are all going to hell! This is a top-secret. Clear? Yes, sir. You should kill yourself. Seppuku! What the hell are you doing? Careful. Watch your teeth. Why don't you test it using your solution? No need to test. It's real. If you don't have any objection, can we move back in? Of course! We're like a family. We should stay together. We're like a family? It's good to be rich. Why are you so happy? I won't sleep on the street anymore. Look. What's this? Golden armor! Now we belong to high society. We should eat dumplings. Make some dumplings, come on! Didn't you say we'd eat noodle soup every day? That's so not high society. I'll go and buy some meat. Get prepared. We're gonna make the neighbors jealous. Don't touch me. This is my territory. Whose territory is this again? Wu Ge - San! This is your place! My place is your place, right? What did you call me? Arch-enemy of Criminals! Is there anything you want to tell the Arch-enemy? Arch-enemy, I didn't do anything. You didn't do anything? Then where did this come from? Wu Ge, this is yours. Thank you for saying that. But this really isn't mine. This time you're screwed. Take him! Wait! Bullying my son is like bullying me, Golden Dart 13. I'll kill you! Watch my dart! Bastard. Tie them up! Hey, stop! Golden Dart 13 fights for justice. No one comes near. Don't come any closer. Don't... Put your guns down! Your guns... Little bastard. Look, old man, we've met before. If I can find you, I can find your son. You'd better tell us where he is. Or... Don't cut my hair! I'll tell you. My son has joined high society. He really doesn't know. But, he's got a good son. [ The Qing Dynasty Murderer Gets Arrested ] [ Sentenced To Death For Immediate Execution } For the first time, I asked myself: Is money or my father the most important thing in my life? Father is unique. Whatever time we are in, life talks over money. I can give up money. Just got here? Want something to eat? Noodle soup with pickled cabbages. What do you want? I'm confused. You scared the shit out of me. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Gold. I have gold. In exchange for my father. Arrest him. Open the door. The bank was designed by a European architect. It took three years to complete. It has three-meter thick walls... ...that cannonballs cannot break. Each hole in the air vents is only two millimeters wide. Even a mosquito can't get through. As for the drainage system, cockroaches are sure to fail to get through. So, even if there were no guards, it's impossible... ...to steal the gold. From a businessman's perspective, it's a bank. From a soldier's perspective, it's a fortress. And to me, it's a perfect work of art. We let your dad stay in the safest place in the nation. Only gold will get him out. You just made it. Dad! You're a good son. Come on, let's go home. Sir, I've already given you the gold. We're leaving. You still haven't told me... ...where the truck is, and where are the robbers? As long as you tell me, you can take you dad, and the gold, and of course a glorious future. If you don't say anything, you can't get anything. I can't... 1 want to help you. Don't let yourself get involved. Seizing others' stuff? That's wrong. Of course that's wrong. But it's not good to sell your friends out either. In this case, you should help them. Don't let them keep making the same mistake. Giving back the gold truck. Isn't that helping them? I can guarantee we won't investigate any further. I really don't know where they are. Can I just tell you where the truck is? Don't investigate any further. Not only are you a good son, you're also a good friend. Traitor! Who's a traitor? I'm not a traitor. I'm helping them to right their wrongs. Wouldn't people feel worried if they lost something? Can robbers possibly be good people? I'm afraid they are hurting themselves. I'm helping them out. Traitor! Perfect! We wouldn't have believed they would hide it in plain sight. What a perfect plan. Such a perfect set-up that I'm about to ruin. I really... I really admire myself. We've found the truck. Let's go. But I feel something is missing. News Bulletin: Colonel Toriyama has earned a new medal. The military supplies which had been stolen is captured by the Japanese today. This is it. What do you mean? Once your compatriots hear this, they will get anxious, right? What do you mean? Don't be nervous. Enjoy the music. Perfect! There! There! Here! Take them! Traitor! This is not what you promised. You big liar! Xiao Dongbei, no one can bargain with me, or the Japanese empire. Wait! Yes. The movie queen of Manchuria, the leaders of the rebellion. Let me take a photo with my prizes. You're not worth it! You're just a little actress. We give you fame, honor and dignity. Come on. Release them. Release them. Put the guns down. Don't push me! Come here. Ready. Fire! True heroes don't use guns. Everyone, put your gun down. Put them down! Let's go. Dad, get in the car. Hurry up! Fang. Fang... Fellow heroes, 1, Golden Dart 13, hate traitors the most. A real warrior never surrenders. It's not heroic to fear death. Today, for my son... Dad! Dad! Dad, what happened to you? Fellow heroes, forgive him. Take my life in exchange. No, dad. Son, your old man was great today, huh? They held me back when I fought with the Boxers. They said my dart wasn't a match for gun. Who says that now? Dad, stop... What's that smell? Noodle soup? Noodle soup? I want to taste it before I go. We'll go home after you have it. It smells good. I can't finish that much. It's spilling. Dad! I'll get you another bowl. Son, careful, it's hot. My dad wants noodle soup. Stop it. Son, listen to me. My Dad wants the soup. He's waiting for me. Son. Don't be like this. Let my dad have some soup. Please, I'm begging you. My dad wants some soup. You! Didn't 1 say this was a top-secret? Why are you publicizing it? Were you deaf? What's wrong with you? Since the gold is found, we are safe. I think it's a happy ending. During the visit, the Italian Ambassador DeNiro... ...will attend the wedding of... ...the daughter of Yamato Bank president, Gu Xianming. In the afternoon, the Ambassador will visit the Yamato Bank... ...to sign a treaty on allowing them... ...to represent the business interests. It's the arms deal. Since the gold is already in the vault, there's nothing we can do. Then, kill the Ambassador. For my dad's sake, give me a gun. I want to join you. We're revolutionaries. You're a street thug. We're from different groups. What is essential when you go to war? The strategy. You can't make it when you had money. Now you have nothing. What are you here for? I have money. If you have money, I can deliver you an armored car. I'll give you 8 tons of gold for 1 gun. You've got big balls to brag like that. Toriyama is in charge of security for the vault. Wait near the entrance. Give me a gun. He'll be a dead man today. Once Toriyama is dead, you can get away smoothly with the gold. I respect heroes. I respect you. Call someone to arrest me. I don't want to see you again. You can go now. Do you love him? Help me again. Come with me. Four gifts plus four gifts makes eight. Newlyweds, give thanks for the gifts. I'm gonna get some water. There's one more hour till the wedding. He will arrive before then. One glass of wine and five waters. Give me a glass of orange juice. You first, please. What kind of wine would you like? You don't know what kind of wine she likes? Sir, you are? We are Shakespearean actors performing in honor of the marriage of Miss Xixi. Break a leg. Miss, we are out of orange juice. I'll go get some for you. Never mind. It's ok. I'll get it. I'm busy. Let me go. Give that back to me! Killing DeNiro is our last chance to stop the deal. I'll do my job. You do yours. I just have to avenge my father's death. They're coming. Commander Yokomichi and Italian Ambassador DeNiro. Bring him in. Gift from Ambassador DeNiro. A portrait of the Fuhrer. Listen, after everyone is seated, we'll split up. Everyone find his spot for shooting. Take care. Please take a seat. Toriyama, you're late. Sorry for being late. The invitation came late. Protect the Ambassador! Now! Commander Yokomichi was unfortunately killed. I'm now in charge. I will sign the agreement with Ambassador DeNiro. Xiao Dongbei murdered the Commander. This is a grave of fence. He should be executed immediately. You dare to kick my balls? Nice clothes. Woo, it has pockets. Even if you are better off, I'll still be your arch-enemy, for life. Got any last words? I'm willing to sacrifice myself to wake up the common people. Traitor! I'm a traitor, so what? I got my revelation when the moment the gun fired, why there are rebellions during the years... ...even with enough food to eat. There're people fighting for their belief. There's something bigger than life. God Guan Yu. Please protect us. You've been watching all day. Let me have a look. You ruined our good equipment. What a waste. Do you think Xiao Dongbei can kill Toriyama? You're awake. You scared me to hell! Have some noodle soup with pickled cabbages. How do you feel? Rest here. I've prepared everything. We are leaving soon. We can get away from the city. I've got classmates to help us. Here, I've got you a coat. In case people recognize you. I thought I was dead. Here you are. Wu Ge said he only took 500 yuan. We were lucky to bump into him instead of some greedy thugs. Why did you save me? Xiao Dongbei... Who the hell do you think you are? I deserve to die. This is my fate. Mind your own business! Leave me alone! You said you wanted to take me away, didn't you? Cut the bullshit. I'm telling you the truth. I'm a big fat liar. I was fooling you around. I was using you. What about the rose you gave me? And your promise? Rose? You idiot! It's not a rose! It's a piece of shit! I was playing with you. Just leave. You should cherish your life. I'm not the one that should leave. This is my home, my country. 1 cannot get the gold. But I swear to God, the Japs can't get it either. You guys wait here. When I complete my mission, I will be back to stay with you. Toriyama is still alive. No need to wait. They lost. Let's go. Before the ceremony begins, let's have the two countries' representatives take a photo together to keep a record of the event. Where do you get the solution? Halt! We dig up the ginseng root. Ginseng, you know? Wait! Get out of the way! The bastard really came! He really thinks he's a cowboy. It's totally over. This guy is a true hero, isn't he? Bullshit. He's not powerful enough to take them down. It's like Guan Yu making his last stand. Isn't that the path of a true hero? Hurry up! Get the guns! Fire! Turn the cannon! Turn it! I told you. If you have money, I can get you an armored car. It's acid! Listen, it's time for us to devote ourselves to the mikado! Go to hell! Don't you guys believe in technology? Xiao Dongbei, What's essential when you go to war? Teamwork! We got to work together! You're generous... ...to bring us such a big car. Without this big car, how can we take the gold? You can't take the gold. Don't think little of us. We'd rather be heroes... ...than be rich. Where the hell are you hiding? Come out, bastard! Xiao Dongbei, the armored car cannot help you now. You can shoot me if you want. Talk to him. Get him to turn off the solution. He won't listen to me. He doesn't even like me. When you robbed the truck, you didn't kill her. And she didn't sell you out. Why? Put down your weapons... ...and embrace love. You... ...have to make a choice. Kill her. I can't turn off the solution. You see? It's just a girl. No girl is worth thinking that much about. You're an ungrateful bastard! Blame yourself for being stupid. You're a liar. Just kill her. Asshole! I'll think of you as a coward... ...if you don't have the guts to kill her. You're a total jerk! I don't need to be saved. Mind your own business and leave me alone! Don't say what I said to you. Now, get out of here. Hey, wait. Tell me, do you love me or not? All you can think about is love. It's stupid and boring, alright? Fine, I'll tell you. I don't love you, okay? Xiao Dongbei... Protect the crime scene. Colonel Toriyama has been killed. All the criminals have been killed. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Sir, I'm afraid you're in my seat. I'm afraid you're holding yesterday's ticket. No, I bought the ticket for tomorrow. My younger brother loved to come to the movies. I didn't know what was so great about it. But I get it now.
