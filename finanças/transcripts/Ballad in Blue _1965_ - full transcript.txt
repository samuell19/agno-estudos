"I don't care if you're young or old tonight, " "Get yourself together and let the good times roll." "Don't sit there mumbling," "talkin' trash." "If you wanna have a ball," "You gotta go out and spend some cash." "And let the good times roll baby, now," "Ah, let 'em roll"... "I don't care if you're young or old, no"... "Get yourself together and let the good times roll." "Don't let nobody" "pla y me cheap," "I got fifty cents more than I'm gonna keep." "So let the good times roll, baby"... "Ah, let 'em roll"! "I don't care if you're young or old baby, now"... "You just have to get together and let the good times roll." "Hey, no matter whether" "rainy weather, " "If you wanna have a ball, you gotta get yourself together," "Oh, get yourself under control," "wo-oa-oah"! "Yeah "... Thank you. "Hit the road, Jack," "And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more." "Hit the road, Jack, And don't you come back no more. " "What you say"?

"Hit the road, Jack, " "And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more." "Hit the road, Jack, " "And don't you come back no more"... Thank you so much, boys and girls. You've been such a wonderful audience... but I'm afraid that's all for now. One more! No! Please! Perhaps we can make it another time we're opening tonight, you know, and I must get to the theatre. Three cheers for Mr Charles! Hip, hip! Hooray! - Hip, hip! - Hooray! Thank you so much, Mr Charles. I don't have to tell you how much the children enjoyed it. - It was a pleasure for me. - Hello, darling. - Well, I do hope you'll come again. - Ready to come home now? - Yes, mummy. - And if you do give us a bit more warning. It would be such fun for the children; they could prepare something for you. Next time I will. And I'll also see that you get some records. Er - make a note of that, will you, Fred? Yes, Iwill, Ray. That'll be terribly nice and thank you once again. - Oh, thank you, sir. - Good bye. - Good bye. - Good bye. It is raining, mother? Yes, we'd better wait a minute. I should think I can do my own buttons, mother. I'm not a baby. Hold still a minute, darling, it won't take a second. Is that your little boy? Yes, this is David. - Hello, son. - How d'you do. He doesn't board at the Institute; he comes home every night with me. Um, I'm Peggy Harrison. I'm Fred Parker. Mrs Harrison, it's raining terribly hard outside - may we give you a lift? Oh, thanks awfully, but you needn't. - Yes, please! - Ssh, David! We have plenty of room in the cars, right there. Hurry, mother! Oh... thank you. David's father was an architect. He died when David was just about three. But we remember him, don't we, darling? Yes, mummy. Excuse me for saying this, but you seem so young. Well, I was only seventeen when I married. Won't Steve be excited when he knows who took us home today? Oh, erm, Steve's a special friend of ours. He plays the piano at the Angry Ace - it's a nightclub. Do you know it? No, I don't think I do. David... give me your hand, son. It's a watch with the numbers in braille - feel it? No, no, don't press touch very lightly with your fingers; sort of, see with them. There are tiny, tiny, sort of... ...I can't. Take your time. It took me some time, too, when | first lost my sight. It was keratitis that caused David's blindness. Just six months ago. He hasn't really learned to read much yet. Twelve at the top, six at the bottom. One, two... feel it? It was a terrible shock when it first happened. We're getting used to it, little by little. I try and make it as easy for him as I can. It's so difficult. | start to count, and then I lose it... That's because you're trying too hard. It must be automatic. Here- take it and practise with it alone. You'll get the hang of it in no time at all. Mother, look! Mr Charles has given me his watch. Oh, that's terribly kind of you! But, we simply can't accept it. Why not? Well, it's much too valuable. You've been very kind. Thank you so much. I'm sure it'll be a marvellous opening. - Why, thank you. - Come on. - Bye, sir! - Take care, David. - Bye - Bye bye. I could tell from the sound of your voice that was a good-looking girl. I wanna know how good-looking! Let's see... she's about 27 inches tall, weighs about 140 pounds, eyes the colour of peanut butter and walks on her knuckles, mostly. What do you mean, you can tell from the sound of my voice? I remember when I was a kid, we had an old, bad rooster... ...and you could always tell when something special walked into that hen-house! Okay, Sherlock, you win! And the boy? | wish she'd lay off that kid. She crowds him. What's he like? He's a nice kid, Ray; beautiful kid. Keeps his head down, mostly. Except, I noticed when he was talking to you, there was something kind of tough and... gutty about him. Care to grab a bite at the hotel before we go to the theatre? - Ray? - Hm? Did you hear what I said? Er, remind me to look up Doctor Leger when we get to Paris. - Why? - Just remind me. Okay. I got it. Good enough. Mummy, just because I can't see it doesn't mean I can't find my own back. Hush, darling, you know how terrified I am about accidents in the bath. Accidents? It isn't as if I'd never seen this bath before. You didn't used to do this before I got blind. Little by little you'll get your confidence back, and then you'll be able to do more. I have got it back, all I want to do is to be left alone! Oh, David! There we are. Come on, hold on to the side of the bath. Oop... there. Now, arms in... right, round we go... round, round, round, round, round... Face me, sweetheart. Oops... Hey, you forgot your slippers! I'm just going to give you milk and a biscuit. Mrs Babbidge will give you something before you go to bed. I do wish we could find some other arrangement for me. Why? Oh, it isn't Mrs Babbidge - it's Margaret. Has she been tormenting you? She's a girl, that's torment enough. And she's always in love. Either that, or she's in a temper. It's one thing or another with old Margaret - bloody bore. David, don't say 'bloody'. Well, it is a bore. I don't really need looking after. Mummy, I'm not going to see again, and there's an end to it. Darling, you mustn't say things like that. Remember what the doctor said, that there was always a chance? Now, you must promise me that you won't get discouraged. I'm not discouraged. I'm not going to see again. I'm going to grow up like Mr Charles. But he's a musician and a singer. Perhaps I'll be, too. I'm playing the mouth organ already. You're a dancer, you could teach me to dance. Margaret's already taught me to twist... "Yeah, yeah... Yeah, yeah..." Sit down, darling...! David! "Yeah, yeah, yeah" David, stop it! "Yeah, yeah, yeah" David, stop it! Bloody pair of lunatics, the pair of you! - Mustn't say 'bloody'! - No, you really mustn't! Stop clowning, both of you! Ah, she's got no ear for music, no eye for dancing! Shall we show her again? Steve, will you put him down? Five, four, three, two, one blast-off... Whooh! David! Ha, ha! He's all right. Hey, that's a lovely watch. Where'd you get it? It's a gift from Ray Charles. Now, you heard what your mummy said about clowning. Cut it out! It's true - Ray Charles. He came to sing for us at the Institute, and drove us home. I mean, he didn't drive - he's as blind as a bat, you know... Oh, David, what a horrible thing to say. ...and then he showed me his watch, and asked if I could tell the time on it, and then he gave me it. What, just like that? Yes - you know how these rich Americans are. It must've cost a packet. Hand-made with a gold case. Well, I told him he shouldn't, but he insisted on giving it to David. It must've cost at least a hundred pounds. Oh, well, that settles it. Come on, darling, let me take it off. But mummy, please! No, I mean it. You're much too young, and it's far too valuable. It's a gift! He wanted me to have it! We mustn't take gifts from strangers. Ah, honey, Ray Charles! He's a big boy now. Helen? Hello, Love. Steve. Are you ready, David? Yes, Mrs Babbidge. Would you mind terribly giving him his supper? I'm afraid I'm late for the theatre. Hello, Margaret. Hello. Margaret's already had hers, but there's plenty left over for David. Come along, darling. Er, Helen... we've, er, been invited to a party, so David'll stay the night, if that's all right with you? - No trouble at all. - Thanks, love. Here take your things. Did you, er... get that job? Not the one we talked about... but I've to cut the late Mrs Appleby out in marble. Good night. Are you sure you won't mind, darling? No, mummy. Are you really going to a party, or are you two going to quarrel? Party. Honest. Night, darling. Come on! Good night. You shouldn't have taken the watch away from him. Oh, please stop telling me what to do. He can't keep this. I had no idea it cost so much. And as for that party - at least you could have consulted me about it. Well, there wasn't time. Gina Graham 'phoned; we had a talk; she invited us. Oh! How is Gina these days? Involved with a new man... the usual. How flattering to be her confidant! You keep trying to make trouble for yourself where it doesn't exist. I'm not out with Gina, I'm here, because I want to be. It's like the way you go on with David. I thought we'd get around to that. Well, why not? We've got to talk about it. Look, I can't help the way I feel about David. He needs all the help I can give him. Of course he needs your help - but that's not the same as trying to live for him. Idon't live for him, I'm... just trying to ease him through an adjustment period. The adjustment period's been going on for six months. Ever since he became blind, instead of trying to encourage him to do more, develop more, you smother him! I won't have him defeated! Not so long as there's hope. There's damn little hope. 'Don't count on it' - that's what the doctor said. He's wrong! Peggy, it's becoming an obsession with you. Let it go! I won't! Ican't... My darling, I'm sorry... It's not fair on you. Look, the best thing we can do for David is to love each other... and be happy, the way we were before. Oh, I want that. And I do love you, and want you, but... | feel guilty. I want you too. This is the very latest shade not that I'd expect you to know. They're wearing it on the Riviera. It stinks! Couldn't we do something else? Dominoes... I can do those. Dominoes! It's a bore, your being blind. You're not good at games anymore. Well, it's not my fault, is it? No need to lose your temper over it. I'm just talking to pass the time. It tickles! Hold still! - Margaret? - Hm? What would you say if I told you that Ray Charles was my friend? Ray Charles? I'd say 'you're a nasty little liar'. I'm not lying. He came and sang to us today, and drove us home in his car, and gave me a watch, and he said he was my friend. Do you want a smack? You know I hate it when you make things up. Margaret, David; time to get ready for bed. Now, what on earth...? You get that stuff off his toes and get ready for bed, both of you. Now, you tell the truth about this Ray Charles or I'll give you the supreme torment! It's true - every word. He gave me a watch. What watch? Where is it? My mother took it back. She won't let me keep it. Filthy liar! You'll die and go to Hell. I promise it's true. I'll introduce you to him. You'll do what? I'll introduce you to him. And we'll go in his car until there stands a street... ice cream! And just when do you intend all this to happen? Anytime. Tonight. Tonight? Come on, you too I said, time for bed. "I fuss with my woman," "Toil with my kids, " "I sweat till I'm wrinkled and grey." "Till I'm grey"... "But still that lucky old sun" "Has got nothin' to do" "But just roll around Heaven all day." "Dear Lord up above," "Don't you see I'm pining"? "I got tears all in my eyes." "Why don't ya send down a cloud" "With a silver linin'." "Lift me up to Paradise." "Oh, show me that river," "And then take me across. " "Wash all my troubles away." "We wash away." "Right now, that lucky old sun, now," "Has got nothing to do" "But just roll around Heaven all day." "I said, just roll around Heaven all day. " "I said, roll around Heaven all day"... "You know the man roll around Heaven all day." "Yes, Lord "I More! Thank you... very much. One... two... three... "Well"... "Baby, let me be." "For you don't care about me." "Unchain my heart," "You got me sewed up like a pillowcase," "But you let my love go to waste." "So unchain my heart, now," "And set me free." "Baby let me go. " "Unchain my heart," "Oh, woah, now"... "You know you love me no more." "Unchain my heart," "Every time I call you on the phone, " "Some fella tells me that you're not at home." "So unchain my heart, now," "And set me free." "I'm under your spell," "Like a man in a trance." "You know darn well, now, " "That I don't stand a chance, girl. " "Hey, hey hey"! "Unchain my heart," "Oh, I'm on my way now. " "Oh, woah"... "You worry me night and day." "You lead me through a life of misery," "When you don't care a bag of beans for me." "Unchain my heart, now," "And set me free." "I'm under your spell," "Like a man in a trance." "Ah, you know darn well, baby," "That I don't stand a chance." "Unchain my heart," "I wanna go my way now." "Unchain my heart," - "Oh, baby, now"... - "Unchain my heart," "You worry me night and day." "Unchain my heart," "You lead me through a life of misery." "When you don't care a bag of beans for me." "Unchain my heart, and set me free." "Please, set him free," "I wanna go free, now"... "I wanna go free, now"... "Please, set him free," "Oh, I wanna go, I wanna go"... "Baby, take these chains, yeah." "Baby, take these chains, now." "Well I want to be free now, " "Baby, won't you set me free"? "Please set me free." All right, baby! Thank you, young man. How d'you feel, Ray? Ah, pretty good, Fred, I guess. I'm Arthur Penrose. Of course! I remember you well. Ray, it's Mr Penrose of the Times. Come on in! Come in. Miss Freeman. Mrs Harrison! Hello! Ah, how nice of you to come! May | see Mr Charles? - Of course! - Thank you. Pardon us, will you, please? Thank you. Well, goodbye, Ray. Good luck on your tour. - So long, Arthur. - Your drink, Ray. This is Mrs Harrison - Mrs Peggy Harrison, little David's mother. Oh, Peggy - what a delightful surprise. Why didn't you tell me you were coming to the concert tonight? Well, unfortunately, I'm working, so I only caught the last number. Erm... I wanted to talk to you... about the watch. Oh? It was... it was terribly kind of you, but you've got to take it back. It's far too valuable. Too valuable for who? A little boy? I didn't think so, and I paid for it. Please try and understand. David adores the watch, but he can'tjust take things; they warned us about that at the school. That's right. One of the first things you have to learn is: no charity. You make it on your own. So you do understand. But coming from me, it wasn't charity; it was sharing. David and I are in the same boat, remember. Such a waste... you see, he doesn't know how to use it. He will, and this'll make him want to learn! Here; give me your hand. Take the watch back... and remember this, Peggy: there's a lot to learn. Notjust for David, but for you, too. Well, sermon's over! Thank you. Would you come and have a drink with us tonight - Steve and me? Oh, that's that special friend of yours, right? Yes, he's a composer. He plays the piano at the Angry Ace. Oh, do say you'll come - then I'll know you're not mad at me. Hey, baby! Hello, Ray. Mmmm! Hah, you wonderful nut, you! Peggy, darling, what a surprise! Thanks a lot, Chuck. You were wonderful tonight. Honestly, it's a joy to have you back. The last time you came on with that devilish trumpet you broke up a pretty bit of Yonkers! By the way, you still in the rag business? I sure am - it pays better than blowing a horn. Well, I guess you got something there. I didn't know you two knew each other - what fun! Oh, Gina, I must fly. You will come, won't you, Mr Charles? Ray, there's a Mrs Tullover, she'd like to talk to you when you've got a moment. Yeah - yes, yes, Fred. Sure, dear - right after supper. Thank you so much. Bye. Oh, Peggy - you will come to my party, won't you? I'll try... Oh, Ray, I want you to meet... oh, here he is... George Stewart. He's a painter... I've got the keys. Well, I don't know what you're so excited about. Ray Charles is coming - what am I supposed to do, get inspired? Oh, come off it, darling. Well, you're always trying to get me discovered, as if I were a new Italian restaurant, or something... And now... we come to the star turn of the evening. The very talented Mr Steve Collins will do those curious, if not questionable, things to the piano. Hello, Mr Charles. I'm so glad you found your way. And just radiant, Peggy, dear! Oh, thank you, Ray! - Will you come and sit down? - Sure thing. - Hello, Fred. - How are you? My mum always takes him in when his mum's having a baby. They always have them at night, don't they, Edmond? I said, 'don't they, Edmond'? Always at night. And always quite late... Always quite late. Here's your stop, loves. Now, go straight home, mind? How many brothers and sisters have you got? Twenty-one. Here he is. Steve Collins; Ray Charles, Fred Parker. - Hi, nice to meet you. - It's a pleasure. Pleased to meet you. - Care for a drink, Steve? - That'd be fine, yeah. You know, I didn't see how anyone could live up to the billings Peggy gave you, but I was wrong. It was swingin' - I really dug it! Thanks. Er, scotch, please, Jimmy. It's quite unusual for Ray to go to a nightclub after a concert performance; even more unusual for him to stay. He likes. Er, Peggy told me how kind you were to her and David. I appreciate that. You should've heard the hiding he gave me about the watch. No, I didn't, no, I didn't! I'm not saying I shouldn't have... Oh, say, that cantata you just did... was that your own? That's right, yes. It still needs a lot of work, though. Well, cheers! - Cheers. - Cheers. Hey, what's this? What are you two up to at this hour? We... we've come to see Ray Charles. Ray Charles? At this time of night? Go home to your mums, the pair of you. It's urgent, we've got to see him. But, he's not here! There's nobody here. Perhaps he's asleep inside. I'm sure he wouldn't mind. Asleep inside? He's not here! He's gone to a club... er, the Angry something. Come on. Policeman! I was wondering if you had some extra time? I could use a little help - you know, with the arrangements. Well, I don't know, Ray, Well, to tell you the truth, I haven't heard much of your stuff lately, but... but if you're looking for a pop sound, well, there's others that can do it... I'm not looking for a pop sound. It's your sound that I like. Well, I suppose I could manage something... I just don't want to waste your time, that's all. Look, let's not waste each other's time. I'm always changing things, looking for something new, bright, and different... No, what I'm getting at, Ray, is that... um... you have a very personal style... I, I don't know whether I could adapt my stuff, make it work for you. Maybe, er, Steve needs a little time to think it over, Ray. I don't think we'd have any problem. I can adapt myself if a man can show me a musical reason. I do it all the time. Maybe we can see eye to eye - who knows? Okay, why not? What have I got to lose? Okay. That's enough business for the night. Let's go home. Ready when you are. Well, I really enjoyed it. See you tomorrow morning at 11.30, Steve? That's fine, Ray. The entrance is in the basement. Steps... Here we are. You're in front of the door. Go on in and ask. You go. You're older. I can't go into a nightclub alone - I'm a girl. Besides, he's your friend. I might trip over something. Then we'll go together. - All right. - Go on. For the love of...! Hey, you're... you're... what's his name? Ray, it's the little boy! Oh, please, I'm terribly sorry! That's Peggy's boy, David. What in the name of Heaven are you doing here? Who's that little girl? Mr Charles, sir, I just wanted to introduce you to my friend, Margaret. Don't tell them your right name! But it's all right this is Mr Charles. David, do you mean you came all the way down here just to... how did you know where we were? They told us at the theatre. I'm going to get his mother. Oh, please don't! Wait a minute, Fred. David, if you came down here to introduce us to your friend, maybe you'd better introduce us. Ray, I really think that Peggy ought to know. It's all right. We'll just get a taxi and take them straight home. What's her name? Margaret. Where are you? I thought you wanted to meet Mr Charles. So, you're Margaret? Margaret Babbidge; Mr Ray Charles and Mr Fred Parker. Margaret looks after me. I can tell. Pleased to meet you, Margaret. Now, Fred, take David's hand, and Margaret, you take my hand... and here we go. - Mr Charles, sir... - Yes? ...would it be all right if! called you 'Ray'? Sure it would! Well, then, Ray, as it's so late already, a few minutes more wouldn't matter... do you think we could stop somewhere for ice cream? I don't know... what do you think, Fred? Frankly, I think we're inviting disaster. I've got my own money - enough for Margaret and me. There's a cafe still open, if anybody's interested? - Are we interested? - We are interested, indeed! Okay! I'm going to sneeze. Don't you dare! Concentrate. David! Ach-oo! Ach-oo! What's taking so long? The handkerchief. - What? - She's got the key tied up in a handkerchief! - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Good night, children. It's time I took a mate, as they say. And he's a perfectly marvellous specimen. I'd expect nothing less. - He's intelligent, cultivated... - Yeah, go on... Filthy rich, eh? And generous. Hey. I didn't say "filthy rich" I just said "rich". And, anyway, what's wrong with him getting me a Jaguar? I don't seem to recall you ever giving me anything. Well, you were the one with the money. I was a starving artist. Besides, it's not the issue, is it? No, it's not. The point is, if I accept the Jaguar I'm committed to it. I... I mean, to him. Well, it's a problem, isn't it... Of course it's a problem. And I'm asking you to help. Well... d'you love this... paragon? I mean, really? Of course I love him! And you're prepared to give up your precious freedom, hm? Look, love, we've been through this half a dozen times before... Oh, I shouldn't have to give up my career. Heavens, no! You may be the most attractive fashion buyer in London, but you're not the only one, you know. You've got to greet the competition that you invited. Oh, Gant and Bobby! Now, look, you stay here - I'll be right back. Double whisky, please - same again. Here he is! The poor man's Menotti. Where've you been keeping yourself, Stevie? I haven't seen you around the museum concerts in six months. Oh, hello, Antonia. Ooh - new hairdo... new dress... New patron, too. Over there. ...and that did it! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...! He makes the most awful noise... but, beneath that well-corseted exterior lies a heart of pure money. Hmm. But imagine having to wash it and feed it! Better for the lungs, Stevie boy, than the air in that scruffy cellar of yours. A composer does have to make a living somehow these days. I know... I know. I've been thinking of doing some arranging for Ray Charles. Ray Charles! And you talk to me about selling out! It's... it's better than playing nursemaid to that old goat! Well, at least my talent's not for sale! Talent! What talent? More than you'll ever have! You must loathe yourself! Well, it's no worse than listening to all that 'Yay, yay', rock 'n' roll garbage! It's notjust rock 'n' roll - he's a very good artist! "Artist" I? Now you've done it! "Artist"! It's a dirty word! Time, Steve, Antonia... You're nothing but an intellectual snob! - You leech! Parasite! - Oh, come on! Hurry, darling, you'll catch a cold! Are you dissolving, sugar daddy? What was that all about? It's all Peggy's fault. Peggy's fault? Three years ago it was always my fault... If she'd have come to this stupid party I wouldn't have had so much to drink, and I wouldn't have bothered to argue with that idiot. But Peggy said she was tired. Yeah, yeah, I know... it's all she's been lately. Ah, there's no fun anymore. Oh, you're not fair. She has to get up early every day to take David to school, and in the evening there's the ballet. Yeah, I know, yeah... Anyway, what was that about Ray Charles? He's offered me a job. All right, I know I haven't wanted to take on a job until now - I mean, not a full-time job, that is but that's been Peggy's excuse for not marrying me. She has to go on working, she has to go on bearing, you know, the responsibility of the boy on her own... well, things are going from bad to worse. All right, I'll take the job, see what difference it makes. Are you sure you really want that? Well, what's wrong with it? It's time I got out of my ivory tower. Truth is... I've been afraid to leave it. What's so funny? Ah, I can't help it. A little while ago it was me and my mating problems, now it's you and yours. Do you suppose we're really meant for each other, after all? Thank you for a simply marvellous party. Hello, darling. - Well, d'you know what? - No? I got the job! Oh, darling! I was afraid to- No, there was nothing to it! I played a few things, and Ray really liked some of the stuff in my cantata. - Good taste, I'd say! - The best! He asked me if I had a couple of ideas on some of the things he had, and what do you know...? - And what? - I had a couple of ideas! Ha! You're... brilliant! I've got a job! I've got a good, well-paid, respectable job! How much? What would you say to, er... a hundred pounds? Oh, get away with your blarney! ...for a start; more if it works out. Plus a percentage of the record, if any, that is. Depending on it. You not kidding! And, a paid vacation! But so much! Well, the man's a big star. How did he get there? Buying top talent. Oh, the conceit! But I adore rich men... Ah... you don't care that I've sold my soul for a mess of pottage, do you? D'you mean that? Oh, Steve- No, darling, I'm kidding. I like him, and what's more important, I like the music; it's fresh, it's vital... Oh, thank Heavens! You know, it's going to take me a little time to believe all this. Ah, you'll get used to it. Now, come on, let's go home and pack - we're off to Paris. - Paris? When? - Day after tomorrow. David too? - Well, of course it is- - But it's impossible. No, it isn't - I've got the tickets. You can tell him after the theatre tonight. See you later. Steve, wait. Steve! Steve, you're going to Paris, of course, but David can't go and I can't go, either. It's out of the question! But it isn't only Paris - after that we go to Rome for two weeks, then Bern, Vienna... But it... it's impossible, I can't move David about like that, I just can't! Hey, he'd have the time of his life! But he's blind. But he'll be with us. He'll learn new things, you won't have to work, you'll be able to tutor him. No. Now, listen Peggy... I know that in the past I haven't been able to give you the security you needed. But you know I love you, right? Oh, Steve, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about David. He needs stability. I can'tjust take him out of school, just like that. Oh, no, no, the treatments... But you mustn't rely on those, the doctor keeps telling you that. He may even stop them in a few weeks. Darling, you know I love you. But I can't go, and that's an end to it. It's just too risky. And, you know, the job mightn't work out... Why not? Look, it's taken you a whole year to do this, and you want me to change everything in five minutes. You want me to... to trust you, rely on you... to put myself and David entirely in your hands. Yes. But this is the first decent job you've had, the first one that you've tried to get! Well, I've got it now! I won't take risks with my child! Mummy? Yes? Are you all right, mummy? Yes. Wouldn't you like to go and play with Margaret? No, thank you. Is Steve home yet? Yes, he's in his room. Have you two quarrelled again? Yes. I'll just get you your supper. Hello... Oh, hello. What's that stink? Margaret put something on my hair. She's killing me with kindness these days. You want to watch that. If she tries putting lipstick on you... punch her on the nose. All right! Are you going to treat me like my mother, or are you going to tell me what's going on? I'm sorry. I've got a job; I'm going away. Thought I felt a suitcase. You said you're going - not us. No, not right away. It must have been a heck of a row - you're both so quiet. About me, wasn't it? About everything, David. I'm sorry. Where are you going? Paris, then Rome... I'm going to be working for Ray Charles. And you're not taking me? I wanted to take you you know that. But your mother wouldn't agree. Now, listen, maybe she's right. It's easy for me to criticise. She's not right, Steve. She treats me like a baby when you're not there. I hate it when I'm made to feel helpless. You've got a lot of guts, Davy. I'm not worried about you. Do you have to go? Well, yes, I do. It... it's a good job. It's something I can do; something I should do... actually, it may be for the best. DO you really believe that? No. Neither do I. But there's one thing - will you be coming back? Yes... course I'll be coming back. First day back in London, I'll come and see you, Okay? I'm sorry about the stuff Margaret put on my hair. Look, don't worry about the cost. I'll pay for it, we can work something out later. By the way you heard from Peggy? Well, yeah, I sent her a telegram I'm going to try and phone her later on. Look, the doctor did say there was a chance, didn't he, Ray? Steve, as I told you, there is a chance; one out of a hundred. I know that's not much, but it's the best we've got. I hear that this Dr Leger is one of the leading eye surgeons in the world. That'd be just great, Ray. Of course it'd be great. But you stay cool. Uh, Tommy - could you hold it up forjust a minute? And, brass - please play a little soft. I can't hear the reeds. All right, fellas - lets try it again from letter C. Ray, there are some reporters in the auditorium. They'd like to talk to you when you've got a minute. Oh, that's right. Gentlemen - I'm terribly sorry, but as you can see, we are trying to get ready for tonight's opening. So if you'll excuse me forjust a moment and speak with Mr Steve Collins, our new arranger, I would appreciate it very much. Er, Steve... can you take care of this for me? Sure, yeah. Ah, bless ya. And, Uh, where's the piano? That's a good piano. Okay - one, two... one, two, three, hey! I'm Hawkins, United Press, Mr Collins. Tell me, what's it like for a white man touring with an all-Negro company? Excuse me for a moment, will you... Ray? Yeah, Steve? I gave your second trumpet a B natural. Oh, that's right, that's right... it's a better sound, too. Say, band - let's try to play the arrangement right, now. You may not like it, but still, remember it's not costing you a penny. So let's get on with it here now. One, two... one, two, three - hah. "By the time I count from one to four"... "I hear her" "on my door." "In the evenin' when the sun goes down," "When there ain't nobody else around," "She kisses me, she holds me tight," "Tells me that everything's all right, " "And I know now, yeah, I know"... "Hallelujah, I just love her. " "Mmmm, Hallelujah"! "Woah, I just love her so." "Yeah, she's my little mama"... "And baby"... The trouble with that cake is, it's delicious - and I'm on a diet. Man, this got ate too soon. I think it's a shame. Pretty hep, though. Pretty hep... ...sure it cost a lot - but you can wear a dress like this for years... ...oh, no, he wasn't too young for me... I was too old for him. Ah, come on... Now, nobody asked me to make a speech... Ah, make a speech, man! ...but then again, nobody said I couldn't, so I'm going to make a speech! Now, first of all, happy birthday to Millie... ...thanks to Ray for the party... ...but, mostly, I'd like to thank you all for the last ten days - and your friendship. Since the first day I joined you, it's been a ball. Well, that's it. Didn't hurt too much, did it? Hey, Steve... remember that theme you played the first night I heard you? What was that, Ray? Er... you know, something that went like, um... Ah, sure - that's from my cantata. Here we go... That's it, that's it! Er - have you ever thought of doing it something like this... Now, do it in your own style, of course, but who knows, maybe you can come up with something? What, you... you mean... do it as a number? Yeah, make a complete song of it. Oh, I don't know, Ray... I hadn't thought of it in that way before. Well, naturally, it'll be left entirely up to you. And, er, I've been meaning to ask you, too - have you heard from Peggy? No, not yet, no. Ready for bed yet, Ray? You can say that again, baby. I'm whipped! And, er, Steve - let me know how you come out on that little deal we were talking about. If you have any problems maybe I can give you a hand. - Thanks, Ray. - Okay. - Good night, Steve. - Night, Fred. Good night, everybody. Good night, Ray! - You can take the co- - Happy July the twelfth! But Gina, what the heck-? I brought along the price of admission! It's good to see you. Come on in, love. Well, wh... what are you doing here? How did you get in? So, don't I get my welcoming kiss? Mmmmm That's better. Now lets have a look at you. Too haggard; too much smoking; too much hard work. But othenNise in great form, I'd say! Thank you. Well, come on Gina, let's have it... what're you driving now? Well, you remember my old Rover? I couldn't bear to part with it. Ah, same Old Gina... no strings, no attachments. I had to come to Paris on a buying trip sooner or later... so when I heard you were here, I came sooner. You know, you look so marvellous, the least I can do is have a shave. Oh, come on - and let the champagne get warm? We're going to finish that, and then we're going out on a nice old-fashioned pub crawl. - Just like Old times, eh? - Uh-hm. Where're you staying? Right here, third floor. Really? When did you get in? This afternoon. Too close for comfort? Not too close at all. To... amour? A chance meeting? La vie? La vie. You are glad I've come? I hope I'm not making things awkward for you? No. No, it's, erm... been a long fortnight. And empty. And you're very beautiful... and welcome. Three years ago, this month; that's when we met. And six months later... ooh, what a row! I'm still embarrassed about it. How's it going? With Ray, I mean. Oh, very well. And I suppose he's satisfied, othenlvise he'd have let me know. As a matter of fact, he's, um, asked me to do a song for him; original. Oh, I'm so glad! Of course, I knew it would work out. You're both so talented. Of course, you're difficult, too... I've mellowed a bit. I like making a living for a change. True, there hasn't been much fun... Work, work, work? Well, if you want to get back to work I shan't mind. No. I did want to be sure I wasn't disturbing you. I like being disturbed. Oh...? Say that again. Oh. '...wherein to the ever-dazzling Gina Graham at Lord and Lady Dangerfield's ever-so-chic party in Paris. Gina's the stunning career woman who keeps all of Mayfair's bachelors in hot pursuit.' Odd, Gina turning Up in Paris, isn't it? I don't think that proves anything, does it? After all, Paris is a large city, and Gina does gad about. I don't think it means anything. Well, if you will insist upon moping about here, what else can you expect? I'm not moping. You've got circles under your eyes. And your skin's gone off. It's unhealthy for a girl your age to be doing without a man. You're not helping David much, either. Oh, I can't expose David to this experiment. I know Steve means well, but you know how impulsive he is. He's been phoning you and sending cables for the past ten days. I'd say he was persistent, not impulsive. Well, that's what I mean - he's always, sort of, grasping at straws. Well, if you've made up your mind that you can do without him... Well, it's not so simple as that. I've got to protect David. I can't go chasing about with Steve, however much I want to... and I do. Have you spoken to your doctor about the French specialist? No. I've been meaning to. You've very little to lose. Maybe I'll see him today. And if he approves will you be off to Paris? Faster, faster! May I ask you something, Ray? Sure. The stewardess said we flew right over the Eiffel Tower. Do you think we could go up in the lift? Sure - but it wouldn't be much fun if we couldn't see the view. Say, Fred, d'you think we could find that pastry shop again? We could sure try, Ray. Fine. Tell you what, David - we're gonna take you out to the wildest pastry shop you ever saw. Wait until you smell those chocolate ?clairs and, mmm... that whipped cream! Then tomorrow we can really do the town, okay? Oh, mother, please say yes! - All right, darling. - Thanks, Ray. That's all right... just remember to keep your ears open. D'you need any help, Ray? No, thanks. We're okay. Now, David, if you hear a car coming closer and closer, just turn away or stop - got that? Yes, I think so. All right, let's see what you can do. All right, David... now, take the wheel. You can do it. Ray, wait. You want me to teach you to drive my motor scooter, don't you? Yes, but I... Well, get movin'! Steve, I'm terrified! Oh, don't be silly, Peggy. He's enjoying himself. Ray, might I ask you a question? When did you become blind? When I was about your age, David; and, like you, I had no brothers and sisters. There we are. What time is it... do I have to go home yet? Well, if you want to get back in time for supper, yes. Ray... Ray, would it be all right if I come to hear you sing once? I've never been to a real theatre at night. Never been? Of course you can. And you'll be my guest tonight. Oh, but it's such a late performance, don't you think? The whole point of staying up late in Paris is so you can have a good excuse to sleep late the next day! Oh...! "Don't tell me your troubles," "I got troubles of my own. " "Don't tell me your troubles." "Just leave me alone, " "Leave me alone. " "Woah, tell it to a friend, now." "I got troubles of my own. " "You say your sweet love left you." "Well, what you think about me"? "I got the same old heartaches," "Same old misery." "Leave me alone. " "Woah, ho, tell it to a friend, now"... "I got a woman, way over town now," "That's good to me, yes I have." "I got a woman, way over town now," "That's good to me, yeah," "Woah, yeah" "She's my baby now, don't you understand, no. " "Oh, yeah, and I'm her lover man." "I got a woman now, way over town," "That's good to me. " "Yes, I have"... "Girl, you know once," "I tell ya, I was blind, " "But now I see." "Oh, yes, I can." "I tell ya, once," "I was blind," "But now I see." "Oh... you know once," "I tell you, I was blind." "But I'm so glad, so glad I can see." "I found that old love." "Has made a fool of me"... "Well, the fields are all bare" "And the cotton won't grow. " "Me an' my family" "Got to pack up and go." "But I'll make a livin'," "Just where, I don't know" "Cos I'm busted myself." "Ah, I'm broke "I "You know - empty pockets. " "Ah... forget it." More! More! More! What time will they pick us up tomorrow, Ray? Er, about three o'clock - you know, it's at least a 45-minute drive to the clinic. - Ray... - Yes? I thought it was lovely. Well, remember that I told you that today would be your day? Up to two hundred... and more and more every time. Mummy! Mummy! David! Will somebody please get David! How is he? He wasn't really awake, it was just a nightmare. Come and sit down. Would you like a drink? Oh, it was horrible! Ssh, come on, darling, it's over now. He'll be all right in the morning. No, no, we're going home. I'm going to take him home with me. No. No, I can't let you do that, Peggy. Look, I can't allow- The concierge just told me. Is David all right? The doctor gave him a sedative, but he's still having nightmares. Yeah, I think he's all right. He was shaken up a bit but he's sleeping now. Yes, I will. Thanks for ringing. Good night. That was Ray. Oh, I shouldn't have come, it was selfish of me. It's true... I was thinking of myself, not David. Peggy, darling, listen. David needs both of you very much. I want to take him home where he's safe, where I can look after him and comfort him! Peggy, this is our last chance - the doctor leaves the day after tomorrow. No, no, no! Now, you're both upset - don't try to decide this now. It's late. Peggy, will you listen to me? You mustn't do this! Oh, cut it out, Steve! Peggy, you've got to go to bed. Steve will look after David. I'll get you a sleeping pill. And you can talk about this tomorrow, when you've had a rest. Yes, who is it? It's Gina Graham, Ray. Gina? Come in, make yourself at home. Ray, er, may I talk to you for a moment? Sure, in a hot second, as soon as I've put on a shirt. I hope I'm not disturbing you. Not at all - speak up. It's about Peggy, Ray. She wants to take David right home. So? Look, you've got to talk to her, Ray. I don't think she'll listen to anyone else. She's had a terrible shock. Well, don't think for a second they didn't scare me out there last night, too. She doesn't want to go through with David's operation. In other words, She wants to leave Steve and go back to London, right? Yes. I don't quite understand you, Gina. Let's be honest with each other. I thought that was what you really wanted? Look, if that's what I wanted I wouldn't be here, would I? Let's just say I've got a slight case of the guilties, and I want to put things right. Well, it's always a good idea to know where you stand though, before you start foolin' around with other people's problems. It's all right, I'll see who it is. Oh, Gina - excuse me. - Hi, Peggy... come on in. - Hello, Ray. We've come to say good bye. I'm sorry, but we've got to go home. David wanted to thank you. I know. Gina wasjust telling me. It isn't that we're not grateful, it's just that David isn't up to the Operation now. I do hope you understand. David. Come here, son. Now, tell me. Are you all right? Yes, I am. I was scared last night. So was I. - But I'm all right now. - Good boy. Now, will you do me a favour? Yes. Would you go downstairs with Steve and Gina while I talk to your mother for a moment? Can we go to that pastry shop again? We'll see, after I talk with your mother. All right. Come on, David. See you in the lounge. Sit down, Peggy. There isn't time to do this gently, so I hope you're big enough to take it. Take what? I'm gonna tell you something about yourself I don't believe you know. Now, you don't really want David to see again. You only think you do. That's a lie! I won't listen to this. You listen, all right, and you listen good. I'm the expert here and I know what I'm talkin' about. You don't know anything about me. I know the mistakes most people can make if they don't think. Now, David needs all the help and understanding he can get. Help, so he can become as independent as possible; understanding, to help him overcome this ordeal he's now going through. But instead of encouraging the boy, you make him depend on you more and more. No, it's not true, it's not true. Then why do you get sore at Steve every time he tries to let David learn for himself? And why, when there's this one chance for him to see, won't you let him take it? I want David to see - I pray for it. I don't want him hurt anymore - I can't take the risk. Not now. Later, perhaps, but not now. There won't be any 'later'. If you lose your courage now, you'll cripple the boy for life. And Heaven help him if you don't change your mind. Oh, I only want to protect him. Peggy, I'm begging you, please, be sensible. Don't protect him; let him find his own way in the world. It's all right... Dr Paul Dulot - telephone, please. Dr Paul Dulot - telephone, please. "You know how to love me, in my way." "Nobody but you, baby," "I do mean you." "Nobody loves me, now, in my way," "Nobody but you, whoah-whoah"... "You know how to love me, now, in my way"... - Did they call from the hospital? - Not yet. "Every night and day." "Nobody but you"... "Nobody but you, baby," "I do mean you." "That's why I talk." "Every Monday," "I'm gonna talk about you. " "And every Tuesday," "I'm gonna talk about you. " "And all day Wednesday," "I'm gonna talk about you. " "And what about Thursday"? "I'm gonna talk about you. " "Whoahl Friday"... "I'm gonna talk about you" "And, you know, Saturday," "Ah, that's my pay day. " "I'm gonna talk about you. " "I'm gonna talk... all about you." "I'm gonna talk about you"... Hi. Hello, darling. Ladies and gentlemen. I have a song here that's just been written for me by a very talented composer, Mr Steve Collins. The song has never been done before. However, I have a special reason for wanting to do it now. So, with your permission... "Love glows", "Like a candle in the window. " "And when it glows," "It brings light out of darkness" "Giving you a rainbow. " "Men without hope of love" "Who haven't really learned how to dream." "Oh, they don't really see," "Oooh, you know, those men" "Are not me. " "I have won" "And I have lost"... "And I have dreams"... "They're all I need to guide me" "Out of darkness," "Brighter than a sunbeam." Mrs Harrison, your son is feeling very well. Yes...? There are no complications. But, of course..., ...we won't know for certain if we've been successful until the bandages have been removed. - When will that be? - Oh, in about two weeks. Will he have much pain? Not much, no; perhaps a little later, when the sedative wears off. What are the chances, Doctor? Good, I think. But, I beg you, save some room in your minds for the possibility that I may be wrong. - Can we see him? - Of course. Please ring if you need me. David? It's all right, mummy - I've been awake for some time. How do you feel, David? Hurts a little, but not much. He can't tell yet, can he? They'll know in two weeks. But there's a good chance. There's a chance that it won't work, too - you understand that? Yes. What we'll have to do is hope for it... but don't count on it. Is that it? That's it. Steve... you're not going off again by yourself, are you? No. No, from now on we'll be together for good. The three of us. I'm glad. Wait till old Margaret hears about my operation. They used this enormous electric saw... David, you know that isn't true. But she'll be green with envy. Oh, and another thing, mummy... Yes, darling? ...do you think I could have a white rabbit as a pet when we get back to London? Of course. I think I'll call him... 'Daffodil'. Well, that's wonderful, Steve. Oh, yes, I understand. "Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong." Such good news... "Gimme lovin' all night long" "All right"... "Woah, it's all right now, hey, yeah"... "When you see me in misery" "Come over, baby, see about me." "Now, now... it's all right"... "Woah, you know it's all right now"... "Hey, hey, yeah. " "Now, break one time"! "That's what I'm talkin' about"! "Roll it, baby." "You wanna tell your mama, tell your pa" "Gonna send you back to Arkansas, right now." "Mama, you don't do right, yeah. " "You know, you don't do right, now." "Oh, yeah" "Tell me what I'd say." "Tell me what I'd say." "Tell me what I'd say, now," "Tell me what I'd say." "Tell me what I'd say, now," "Tell me what I'd say." "Woah, I wanna know." "Say, I wanna know, know. " "Oh, girl, I wanna know." "I tell ya, I wanna know." "I wanna know." "I wanna know." - "Mmm"! - "Aahh"! _ "Oh"! _ "HO"! - "Mmm"! - "Aahh"! - "Mmm"! - "Aahh"! "Ow, you make me feel so good, baby"! "You make me feel so good." "Owww"...! "I said, I feel so good"! "You make me feel so good, now." "Make me feel so good"! "Now, one more time, baby"! "I said, one more"... "One more"... "Oh, baby, one more time"... "One more time, now, now"... "I said, one more time"... "Oh, let's go home"! "Woah oh, let's go home"! "I wanna go home"... "Oh let's go home, baby"... "Oww, let's go home"!
