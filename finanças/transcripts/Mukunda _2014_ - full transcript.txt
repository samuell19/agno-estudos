These walls are built in height, dude. For you only built! No need to run buddy, she stopped for you only. He didn't get any other girl, except daughter of municipal chairman brother!

He looks pretty good. Also I talked with him That height, behavior et cetera. he was in my focus. I came here to see his parents by leaving all my work. While I am observing you and your speech my son resembles you like when you are good. Then how much attention you have to pay for your son? He has to grow and aware of all things But here, at onion market I am not getting you, sir. Even I can't understand my son's talk. That's why I never ask him anything. Now also I am not asking why you come and on which work? I don't like to ask. Then I won't compromise, you know? He is also same like you! I am seeing him since his childhood. He never step back. He is like an onion in your hands. Time If time permits we can rotate earth like an onion. Prayers. Prayers. Today is an auspicious day so Lord will appear in north door direction. He will appear in that direction Girls, angles Lord is waiting so, you all dressed in a Gopika attire and dance before God. Lord feel happy and he blessed you with good husbands. Cricket. Hey! Go. Why S.I. has come? Why should we bother about him? He may come for betting batch. Our chairman sir is a binami of ministers and he gathered money from all and he bought 6000 acres land in Chhattisgarh for Rs.2000 per acre You came here to kill him. You thought that no naxalites in this area and you are roaming on roads without hesitation. I got doubt when I saw you. Shall I write the truth you will become a hero in one day. Huh? Don't worry! Watch the match. You caught the naxalite very wisely. You police people see anyone in village What is his temperature and heat what is his melting point what is his density and pressure What is his geographical area and what is his height with mean sea level whether he is receiving sun rays in straight line or inclined lines You have to know all. Since how many days he has been here? Since 4 months. Then, he may addicted to this water. His intelligence may also increase. What will you do him? Nobody will ask even we kill him. Really! - No doubt in it. Then he may have a bunch of 4 or 5 members, right? They may rome in our village only. So many youngsters, roaming freely. Someone came, who is that? Surprisingly, how I got his name from my mouth? I never thought that I will become S.I. I have not written exam for that, lack of clarity is the reason. See, him! Even he also don't have clarity why he is killing public. You too don't have clarity that what for you are sleeping and awake. Hey, you next! Why it is missing since hours. If I beat correctly you will die. - Sir! Someone came for you! Where is Arjun? He is here only. Where? Inside. You killed him or going to kill? We have a constitution, you know? If anybody is wrong you have to surrender him in court, right? You know we are youngsters, boiling blood! We don't get enough sleeps! All together we will go on tomorrow. Till then we will sit here. We have 30 minutes of time. Not all these nonsense, I came here to see Arjun. All the public will depend on us, that's the issue. Please sit down, sir. - There architecture is good, arrange there. To protect someone a place is required and need goons and they belong to us. How can I compromise with this mischievous guy? Tell him to keep all this in his house. He trapped a girl and he wants to enter in her life and house means How can I tolerate? I will peel his skin! To solve human relation issues what kind of court will suitable? If law cannot control youth ideas will it control anguish of girl side relatives? Here, your soul is court and what you speak is justice. You speak wisely, sir. You behave in a soberly manner. Even people think that you are right. But, how many murders and conspiracies you planned to reach this level? Do you think no one will think? It's your belief that no one will think. You will eliminate him? You are not a fool to underestimate others. One life You want to kill If he done mistake he will bear it. It's a big mistake to kill him without he experience it. He also have a mother and father. They have their hopes and dreams. How much you and your intelligence before that things? Do you think that moving closely with naxalites is small issue? Do you know it needs lot of guts? The truth is known to you and me. If you want to tell the truth and you have guts to tell the truth Go away from here. Otherwise, I will start talking. Truth, sir. Who is that? Calling me for small issues? If he stays another couple of minutes he will set him. Hey! - Coming sir. Give me that. Hey, see that! I will not ask you that why you are protecting him? But, be careful! Whoever speaks we will stop at a point. He also studied like me, father. He also thinks like me. But he bents for something. If not having that inability, everybody will be great. If that is not gone, not only me, nobody can protect him. Where is our daughter? Still they are in temple. Very active! Boat is ready? - Ready sir! Here it is. Hey. Suryapet reached, Suryapet!

He handled nicely, sir. He is unique person. With small tasks. All these elections are necessary, sir? But we can't stay like that. Because we part of society. Every time we wish good to win. But, bad will win. My heart will reap for that. Sir! It will take couple of days to come out. In case, suddenly if good wins Then I can say, this heart will tolerate it or not. No sir, don't say like that. We changed like that, sir. Okay, sir. - Okay, please. 6th ward No need to check it, sir. Greetings! Hey! Kakinada Ratna! Come on chairman, sir. Come.

Ours is a solid rock. You are getting sweat sir? Is it? Do you have hanky? Yes sir, then wipe with that! At the end of first round from one to eight wards Aeroplane win in 3 wards and Onion win in 5 wards. He is gone in the first round. Don't hurry man! There are still 4 rounds. I am getting updates in phone. Don't worry! Don't sneeze, stupid. Go aside! Go and take medicine for cold, go! Give me that glass, man Take another. Is coming! Do you think that why this water glass in my hand? Last time in the same way in the start of second round, I hold the water glass and we win. By the end of second round from 9 to 16 wards 6 Aeroplane win and 2 onion win. Total, Aeroplane won 9 and onion won 7 wards. What? Counting has started. I told you to take a tablet. Do it. Are you surprised why I raised my color? Third round sentiment. We will win. Look there. Still counting! Tension is raising. Surprising everyone expectations Onion has not win anything and Aeroplane win in 8 wards. By seeing our counts oppositions are shouting. Now you got it! How my scholar sentiment worked out!

What happened, man! The inspiration you gave isn't normal. This isn't the time to celebrate for me. I should do work. Wonderful news! Breaking news! 'Plane' has lost to 'Onion'. We lost the elections. 'Pithapuram oil' can be purchased from market. You all better use it. Hail! We, even at this age, don't know about it completely. He is just a kid enjoying his days. What does he know? Someday with God's grace he will get a good idea. Then he will come to us to talk about it. We will tell them to go ahead but be careful. What else can we do? Thank you, sir. Elections went very well, sir. Wonderful! I didn't expect it to turn in such a way. You might be thinking that you only could do anything and there will be none other for them. You might be the only one to help them. Everyone will be next to you. But that guy says who am I to help everything I did was for myself. There is modesty in his words. And pride in yours. People caught that very intelligently. Everyone was listening to preaching and following them. They silently caught the intent. They did right in front of my eyes. When people come to you you make them feel that they are of low class and useless. But that guy didn't let his grip go till last minute. Without surrendering for anything he stood tall and proud. We come for elections and see the final results. But during this election the only thing I kept thinking is what kind of girl will this guy marry. Okay, sir. I am returning to Hyderabad. See you later! Sorry! I have a small request. Before leaving I want to touch that chair. Did your family upset about election results? How long will you hesitate? How long will be scared that someone will see? That is why I have decided to go to Bangalore. Why so suddenly? Something has do, some end is required, right? Are you going immediately? Within two or three days. Within two or three hours. I have to go. Why did you stop? What about our quarter? Forget about quarter, idiot. Everything is closed. Get on. If we still follow him there won't be anyone more foolish than us. Get on. Hey, I will kill you. Brother! - Move away. Don't come in my way. Hey! - Brother? You shut up! I will kill her. I will not let you live. Hey, what are you doing? Leave her. Leave me! - Stop it. Move. I am telling you to leave her! Hey! What happened? We have lost all our dignity at outside and in house. I will kill you today! Stop! What happened? If you know what happened, you heart will stop beating! Weak minds useless adventures! They find their path to die will commit anything. Now, we have to strike on it! To save one guy we need a place to protect ourselves. But this time, it is not here. Outside. Our goons should be there. But this time we need two. One for auspicious and another for ominous. Subham! One for ominous. For whom? In the matter of that guy! How much time they take for interview? One hour? They may peel our skin by asking questions, right? Hey, you don't try give answers quickly! You just looked in to his eyes, with your looks only he has to give job. What happened to him, seems to be dull? - Is it new to us? Greetings sir! - Madhubabu sir, how are you? I am fine, sir. All our people get into train, see? Please, get in. Greetings! - Greetings!

Thank you sir. Assuming that she will bring some issues they kept her with them. Suddenly this engagement, I am not getting! Everything is going smoothly I don't know why these girls bring this situations? No, man It's always better to follow our husbands. In that election moment, even though we didn't feel smile We laughed continuously till our cheeks get pain. This is also same like that! In this situation, you need Mahesh babu? Over smart! Hey, why are you getting down? Where? What happened? Where are you going? What happened? She will be back, stay cool. She will be back, aunt. What happened to her? What happened dear, come inside.

Hello! They will surely to kill me! I came to Hyderabad without telling you. Now, you are also not here to save me. I don't know anything. To be frank, now only I realised. You are also not here.

What is this? Even though I am bridegroom side I am getting tension when I am seeing your people. You are M.L.A Don't you plan to do this grandly? Then why are doing this secretly? Is it your hesitation or his intelligence? You told correctly, sir! - You go to Kayinada! It's better to end with discussions. If we try to handle him, he will go to any extent. It's better to send our girl with this boy is easy, sir, right? What is his attire! - They are youngsters, you know? There are 70 percent of youth in our country even the world also not having this much youth. Our's is "Yuva Bharat" country. So, How would be the ideology of youth? In our country, poverty is a major issue, sir But, it will be eradicated only when everybody started working. Corruption also big issue, sir. But, it can be abolished when they behave like educated. But the major issue is lack of confidence. Low aspiration, low aspiration is international crime. Just spread this sir, that's enough. Everything will be set automatically. - Where did you acquire this knowledge? Where did you get this clarity? Is there any guidance? Or, your father prepared you. My father is an ordinary middle class father. He used to work 7 days in a week. I think that's enough for me to work hard like that. Apart from that, What should I learn from father? Hey, we reached so far by chit-chat. See! If any bus is coming? We will catch it. Hey, bus is coming. Please, get inside sir. Come, we will sit here. Sir, sir. Sir! What? - Nothing sir. If you come this side, I will sit there. Sir, please understand my problem. What man? - Nothing sir. One is following me. That's why I am trying to escape. Who is that? - Who means? That tall candidate. Hey, he is my person! Hi uncle! - Come here! How are you uncle? You, here? I - You changed a lot. You become elder. Sir, if you don't mind I got it sir. - Please. You both of you sit here and chit-chat. I need to sit there. How crazy you are? Why my journey is like hell? Sit, sit down. Discuss family matters. You changed a lot, it's been long time to have you. Where are you from? I am coming from an interview, uncle. - Which interview? Income tax officer. You will get it, no doubt. What else uncle? What about you? Mine is a big story. I will let you know, let's go. Everyone has his own narration like this. We hope every story should have happy ending. If it has to happen, we must know our strength and weakness.
