Our pride and the historical ground; the Aranganathan ground As we celebrate it's 64th anniversary... our historical leader, minister P Harichandran... is on his way here In order to pay ode to our great leader, Lt. Thiru. V J Aranganathan... the man himself, the human encyclopedia is on his way The man who shines upon us like the light house, is on his way He is the ex health minister and current sport minister Son of our soil, our very own brave heart is on his way The voice of the down trodden and the living legend is here! Here he comes! Here comes our heartbeat! Here comes our minister! To all my brothers, sisters and friends from Karaikal... my heartfelt greetings to one and all When I see these young players gathered here... it reminds me of the lines written by the poet Bharathidasan from Pondicherry " Be on your toes, children. Let not laziness overtake you" Chief... - What is it? - Great poert Bahrathiyar wrote that Sekilar wrote Kambharamayanam! Thiruvalluvar wrote the Purananuru! It's only when I make a mistake, these media people highligh it to embarrass me And in the process if they write few lines about this academy... then the purpose of my intentional mistake is served As I talk about this academy, it reminds me of a tragedy from my childhood Chief, please control yourself As a child I couldn't afford a hockey bat and I used to play hockey with a ladle Only if there was an honest minister like me back then You would have got an excellent hockey player like Sachin and Dhoni, for sure In a way it's good because you got an honest minister in me, today I promise you all this... The hockey stick that these palyers use might be bent... but I'll will never bend and pave way for anything that will snatch their freedom I promise that we shall practice, fight and win gold in a disciplined and honest way All I feel like saying is... our trophy is our right! Thank you! Chief! That speech got me crying Long live minister Harichandran! Long live the legend! Long live our minister! Long live minister Harichandran! Sir! Sir! Hey! This is unfair Hi sir - How are you? - Hi I'm a big fan of yours. What are you doing here? Drats! I was better off reviewing movies Joined this news channel and it's exhausting What's the problem, sir? I hear that there is a history behind this ground I thought I'll find it out from the minister but he just left I need to film a documentary about it but looks like it's impossible Sir, the history behind this ground? - Come with me. I'll help you - Really? I know someone who can tell you but do you have the patience and time? Come on! I do - Then follow me, sir - Come on Come on Sir... Sir, he is the one I was talking about I see Greetings Don't you keep repeating the history of Sir Aranganathan to everyone here... Here is someone who wants to know about it Narrate it one more time for him - Right! Sure - See you, sir - See you - So nice of you First, have this juice - Sir Aranganathan... - Just a minute, sir Let me place the mic - So are you gonna record whatever I'm gonna narrate? - Of course Nice That's not just a statue of Sir Aranganathan... That's an idol of a God Our God! I was 16 years old then Though the Britishers left and India got it's independence in 1947... Pondicherry didn't attain it's independence until 1954 It remained as a colony under the French This ground is a part of a place called Kilinjalmedu Which in turn comes under the Karaikkal district That was the time genetically modified farming was slowly making it's way into India French businessman Dumas witnessed all these... He felt that he could earn a fortune if he also could start and run a manure business Hence he made up his mind to start a manure business That's where all the issues began If the wastes were dumped into the flowing water body... it shall find it's way into sea. The ground is right beside the stream where the sea and the river meet... and he got the approval from the French governor to start his company here There was no way we were gonna let that happen! Back in those days, the Britishers had a practice In order to solve any land disputes under their control... they would face off in the game they are good at... and the dispute will be settled in the favor of the winner Hockey is to French like Cricket is to the Britishers And so... The governor called for a hockey match between the French company and the fishermen in this area I was a young blood and I immediatley shouted out... " This is unfair" " A rich Dumas has the government and the officials by his side" " Whom do we have? Whom do we trust in?" Title: NATPE THUNAI ( In friendship, we trust!) During the 1948 Olympics... the only Tamizhan who played in the independent Indian hockey team... was our own Aranganathan sir He was the first ever player to be India's hockey goal keeper The first coach of the Kilijalmedu's hockey team It was him! He said made me the goal keeper and said " I can see! You have no fear in you!" I didn't let the opponent score even a single goal! We defeated the company team with a score of 3-0! After winning under his coaching, the governor too jumped onto our side As a gratitude, we handed over the land to him He said "A sport keeps everyone healthy and fit" He handed back the ground to us This ain't just a ground as far our people are concerned This is our temple where our Sir Aranganathan continues to live - Slevi - Yes ma'am - That's my birth place - Is it? I was born and brought up, playing in that ground Thank God, at least now people know about Sir Aranganathan - Kumar... - Madam? Here you go Madam! Madam! Madam! Madam! Madam! Madam! Madam! Madam! Looks like Prabha want to leave us all and travel to France Go, mind your business Ma'am, French carnival dance program is happening at the beach Prabha, then that police man... and those little brats from the streets... he has submitted all their names for the dance He already believes that he is French Do you think he'll return if he goes to France?

"You'll learn only if you travel and explore" said the Superstar in Baba! Dear brother, he won't return if he goes there He'll settle down there He'll find out that he has French nationality when he applies for visa Nationality? What do you mean?

He asked for it Look here Along with Sir Aranganathan.... What happened? You shouldn't have asked that Sir Aranganathan practiced and played in this ground from 1948 to 1956 There was a war that took place for this ground We were made slaves Sir Aranganathan helped us get it back You are now standing on the ground that he once stood on Also, do you know what... Don't fall asleep. Hear me out You are able to walk and jog here, thanks to Sir Aranganathan Everyone is able to play and practice here.... thanks to him again! Listen dear... I have a group photo along with him - Also... - Look someone is calling you Who is it? Check it out for yourself - Where? Who is it? - Escape! Check the next one Sir, a ground from where many players have emerged You had even promised during the 60th anniversary, saying " Our game! Our trophy!' - Its that... - What's wrong with the headlines? Our team did it Ewww! Ask them write something that will be etched in history Like I was the one who helped leaders like Kamaraj and MGR, etc Won't it be too much? It is to spread fake news, we are paying our I.T wing - Do it - Ok chief Who are you? Sir, sports director, Prakash Sir there is a history behind this ground Everything in this nation has a history behind it Did you notice at the entrance? My photo has the caption 'The living history' So stop talking about history and stuff! Can we rent that ground for lease to build an hospital and a medical center? Sir, there is only one legal way to do it Say what it is. We want legal stuffs. We hate illegal activities Like Yanam, Mahe and Karaikkal, there are seven academies under Pondicherry. If an academy doesn't perform well then their ground can be rented out for a lease... and that income can be used to fund the other academies Then do it But they perform equally good as the Pondicherry academy For the past four years at least two players have emerged every year Not only that, their coach trains them really well Who is that? Shah Rukh Khan? Half of the nation thinks Shah Rukh Khan is national hockey team coach! What coach are you talking about? How can we turn that academy and the ground to fall in under performing category? Sir, they must not participate in any tournament and... if none of them get selected for the state team then it'll come under that category That shall be done! But they will get selected for sure! They must not Sir? Ensure they don't get selected If I do that, then the academy will question me asking who is behind all this Then confuse them How will I do that? Say Illuminati! Illuminati? Look, even he's confused When we are caught red handed... point to something invisible and they will start worrying about it Meanwhile we must escape Sir, evidences? Evidences is essential only to prove the truth Chaos is all you need to make a lie win! Guess who said it? Surely not Kannadasan Sinthanaialar Silambarasan.... Sir, Thiruvalluvar Actor Aravind Swami said it! - Tell him - That was swag, chief Now, leave - My promotion - Now, leave. He'll take care of it Don't forget about my promotion "500" "501..." Arrgh! To hell with this He is crazy Grandpa, a juice for me - Ok - Why is he calling now? Hold this Why are you crying? I'll kidnap Deepa outside her college gate - You both are tying the knot today - Kidnap Deepa? Uh-oh! I must inform this to boss right away Hello Boss! Pick up the call! Alien baby, Deepa's dad is a police What? A police? That's why I'm tell you Alien baby, forget her Yesterday she spoke to me for the first time in the ground But now your family wants me gone! Because her dad must not bash you up in the same ground Focus on moving to France - First break his friendship - Stop! Stop! - Hey! Watch out - Boss! Boss! Boss! Why aren't you picking calls? My phone... I kept it inside. I didn't want you to get diverted What's the matter? Boss, Asif and his friends are planning to kidnap Deepa Planning to kidnap Deepa? What do you mean?

What's happening? Uncle, we all were just trying to dance Kathakali Kathakali? Dance will now turn into martial arts You better escape Start music! Bravo, ten laps! Non stop! Boys What's wrong with you? Not even a single guy got selected All that training is a waste. Right? - Asif? - Sir Last time you were the vice captain This time, not even in the team - Sir, they intentionally... - No, don't give me any reasons Yes sir You guys didn't perform hence you didn't get selected. Accept it And train for it Now, go - Sir - Yes Kathir No point in scolding them They weren't even allowed for trials Also, something is fishy. Looks like our students were cornered Why do you think so? Sir our ground is now listed in under performing category Our ground? Also the talks are that the ground will be rented out for a lease Prakash would've intimated me Sir it was Prakash who signed the papers and passed it Of course sir! This is an open tournament for the clubs all across India Dhyanchand academy has been hosting it for 60 years now Greetings sir Can I meet Prakash? He is in a meeting regarding the tournament Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Chandigarh, Amritsar, Tirvananthapuram... It has even been hosted six times in Chennai This is the first time it will be hosted in Pondicherry - I'll wait in the canteen - Ok sir They are performers yet none of them got selected Asif, the vice captain. Even he was not selected Hey have you ever tasted the tea from Babu's shop? The cookies out there are waste You must try the coconut cookie here! It's awesome - Look... - Listen! Fine if not that cookie get something else Don't be furious If the selection board didn't select them... what can I do about it? Why did you list our ground in the under performing category? - Who did that? - You! Did you see my signature? Yes, it was signed by you - Was it my sign? - Yes! Then it's not mine! Academy is running out of funds Pour me a tea And when funds are low, an under performing ground can be rented out for lease... that money can be use to develop other grounds, according to rules and regulations! But why our ground? Only this year no one got selected Before this every year at least four students got selected Only this year none got selected Look, these players aren't from rich families They are running their family but doing fishing, delivering papers etc. Look here They couldn't study but they are trying to achieve in sports - But why? - Move! Have you ever worked for the government? The politicians and higher officials will pressurize from both sides My hand will sign without my knowledge Tell me and I can help you as a friend I'll do anything for you Can you help me with this or no? I can't help the whole place. Sorry That's it? Let Harichandran sir come this year to honor Lt. Aranganathan sir He is the sports minister and I know him very well. I'll ask his help Yep, go talk to the person who asked me to put your ground in under performing list Chief, please no! No! Please no! Chief no! Please no! Dear, quiet. We belong to the same team, yet why shoot me? - Sir - What is it? Sports, Prakash sir is here to meet you - Send him in - Ok sir Sir... Ask him to come Come Greetings sir Have a seat Who's this Prakash? Shanmugam, the coach - The military officer. Is that him? - Yes Yes sir Go ahead, tell me Sir, my students had been for the selection - But none... - None of them got selected it seems Irresponsible players! The government is raising funds, you are working so hard... how will they get selected if they play so bad? Actually they performed well Then why didn't they get selected? They were not allowed for any trials They said the selection process was fabricated - Listen... - Chief... let me handle this Look, if students fail in an exam... you can question the teacher or even the principal But not the education minister Don't you know he is the minister? Prakash? Well, sorry sir He didn't mean it that way Sir, why did you list our ground in under performing category? Every year at least four players were selected for Pondicherry team Except this year That's why under performing No one got selected, right? Look, the academy is running out of money We will lease out the ground and use that money for developing the other six grounds You take charge in any one of them Prakash, didn't you explain him? When we say we are gonna rent it out for a lease.... a hospital will be built there How long should people of Karaikkal run to Chennai or Pondicherry for a good hospital? Don't we need our own multi specialty hospital? It's for a good cause A guy named Vetri Maran took his wife all the way to a hospital for delivery They turned a normal delivery into c section in greed of money His wife died The same shouldn't happen to our people right? Hence the multi specialty hospital That's the story of the movie Mersal. All you did was edit out the songs See that, memes have got us confused as to which is real and which is cinema story Listen, I'll do you a favor There is a place that is five times the size of this ground, by the bus stand I'll turn it into a ground using government's fund Re locate the statue and start practicing with the students over there Sir, instead you can build the hospital there and... let the ground free How dare you? Logic? You can't train the players properly but you speak logic to me? We know how to do our job! - What's going on? - Calm down, chief Prakash! Please don't mind, sir Are you upset? Wanna shoot me? No need, sir Look! He is taking the gun He was a military office! Watch out, he might just shoot you Prakash, this is just toy Prakash, you better warn him Sorry, sir. Don't mind it Chief, next is level 2. My turn to shoot Why? Why'd you do that? Thank God they left us alive and in tact I'll overlook everything else... but he offers you the gun and you wanna shoot him, rascal? I'm sure that minister is playing some game! Who are you to question it? Who is he to say that my players are incapable? Oh, so you want him to tell that your players are capable? As a director, I'll say it. Your boys are capable - Your players are the best! - Sir, fixtures Talk about your players capabilities... Here, Dhyanchand tournament Take part in it and compete Win the cup and make it to the headlines The people should read it and declare you guys are the best! You shouldn't advertise that your players are talented... the people must witness and say it Play in any such national tournament and win it Then no minister can do anything to your ground I want the list of the state and national players for the past five years Hey Prabha! - I'll go die - Go, die! The devil is here - Prabha... - Well, that's... Look, how the baby squirrel is eating it's food Prabha! Deepa! What are you doing here? - What are we doing? - Workout Yes, workout Oh, I see. Bye. Bye Hold on, just a minute I'm gonna say it What about that 'Ok' matter? 'Ok' matter? I already told you, no? Not that one Well, you see, he is in love with you... Insect. Insect I know you know it If you give me your consent then I'll leave to my home in Pondicherry then to France Look, selection process is going on If I get selected... I'll be happy - Bye - All the best What if you don't get selected Shut up you ape! She will get selected Will she? You will! You will! Isn't the sports director your friend? Even Prakash came along with me to meet the minister but... I felt he was on their side Sir you were absolutely right Hospital must be near the bus stand Correct... but I think the minister is up to something else in the name of that hospital I know they have something up their sleeve but don't know what How about we file a RTI? RTI? Yes sir Asif's dad is a lawyer. Let move legally Let's try talking to him Do you think we can convince Asif's dad? We can Sir... for the LS Mill girl's tournament... the girls are here for selection The state players list is ready. You may... Come on, we must focus on getting our ground back There are lot of issues around it Well, sir... The girls team selection must happen, right? - Yes sir - Asif... Sir? A girls team selection has to be done for LS Mill tournament - Select and hand him the list - Ok sir The team will be chosen by Asif - Ok sir - Ok You may sign and approve it Forwards, choose you partners If you manage to cross the center line and beat the defense the you'll be selected Ok? - Asif, what about the boys team practice? - Later Set everything up and... - You, ask the goal keeper to pad up - Ok Boys, you have no business here This is girls selection. Leave - You! Leave - You... - You too - Dude?! Asif... - Ok you stay. You, go there - Asif Who's my partner? Your performance isn't satisfying, so you are not a part of the team Performance isn't satisfying? Why? You heard the coach! I get to decide the team And you're not a part of my team. Leave Dude, she's upset! What's your problem? This ain't police station to deal this using your dad's influence Asif you are doing this with a vengeance Vengeance, my foot! Ask her to leave! I'll do. Leave! Please! Now, leave! Get out from here She'll get selected for sure Then she'll select me Then guess where we'll go and have fun? Go to hell! Deepa. Deepa... Hi Deepa? Why are you crying?

You've given the build up. Handle it Sure Boss, you see... Hands of me Simple, select Deepa in the team No, I won't There's his answer Ok boss Deepa, I spoke to him... What can I do Deepa? He is scared Let's go. He is scared Come here - Now, who's scared? - Well, no... You aren't allowing trials for the selection, which means you're scared I'm ready. Find out if anyone will play support for her Deepa, ask your friends Listen, play and you'll make it to the team Are you willing? You? Ready? Look here... no one's willing Because everyone know that this here is a dummy Deepa...Deepa... Take her away. Don't waste time Boss! This is why... This is why you must never trust a girl! Never trust these girls Just trust us, Deepa. Especially me Come here He is smiling. That means we're good. Come, let's go You are talking too much. Why don't you play support to her? - I can't - Why? Why? Because he is a brave heart! Yes! He won't play against girls He'll only play with boys! When did I say that? All the boys left.

Out of the 10 acres only 0.5 acre is for hospital Rest 9.5 acres is for the Tetrastar medical company What's that Tetrastar? Tetrastar, a multinational medicine company They are banned in many countries In fact they are banned in many states here Having that company won't just affect the ground The 14 villages surrounding this ground and... the villages in Nagapattinam district on the other side of the river will also be affected Sir, can't we stop it? There is only one way This ground's name must be lifted from the under performing category You guys don't have to win the Dhyanchand tournament... all you need to do is beat Francis club in the qualifiers We can get the stay order based on that This is the only way out The only way... is that only registered clubs can participate So, how about registering us as a club? You think it's that easy? In order to register a club, you need a home ground Take that academy ground for instance... you must pay 1.2 million to the department as rent 0.5 million for registration Plus a little here and there. Altogether it'll cost you 2 million Shanmugam So if we have money, can we do it? Money? You didn't have money to pay your daughter's fee last year You sold your Bullet bike I bought that bike from you and got an earful from my wife Now what? Are you gonna sell your house?

One national player must be part of the team Whom will you get? Are you gonna play at this age? Can you sit in the squat position for long duration? I have an international player Who's that? Pondicherry Prabhakaran, U-19 captain You might be a psycho but he is worse! He was declared mentally unstable He is back He is back? I wonder what both psychos are gonna do together! Dear Lord! Now, people on the right say 'Vaadi' Now, people on the left say 'Pullai' Now everybody sing 'Vaadi Pullai Vaadi' Why did you come with him? The girl he is in love with is getting married I want to witness it I'll finish you off! Boss, I'm fine with her getting married... but what irks me is the that she is getting married to that doofus!

The other day I played because they messed with Deepa Sir, this is a personal matter Hockey is just not my cup of tea! I gotta settle down in life My uncle is dependent on me - Sir please - Sir why are you begging him? Only those who have passion for this game and nation will know it Don't you plead him Asif... He is cent percent right But if he had played properly and got selected earlier... the ground wouldn't have come in under performing category And you wouldn't had to request me to play Sir, nation, passion and fashion... if this dedication in rhyming was used for the game, we could've won the world cup - How dare you? - How dare you? How dare you raise hands on him? Do you think we'll be mute spectators!? What do you know about him? Five years ago... Let go of me! What do you know about him? Tell me!

You'll hit me if I come more close All you do is eat and while away your time I won't let you so easy! Come here! Everyone has family friends But for me, my friends are my family Usually we find best friends in schools and colleges But I found my best friends in the hockey ground ' The classrooms at school never taught us anything' ' But our friendship taught us a lot' ' Sorrow seldom found us during the childhood' ' We had a good time together' 'We hardly had any money but we were filled with love' ' We fought every day but it never affected our friendship' ' There is no one like my friend' ' There is nothing greater than friendship' ' There is no caste or race in friendship' ' I have nothing to worry when my friends are around me' Azhar! He was the one who taught me to play hockey In our team, I played forward and he played defense Why should I play defense? I'll play forward Only if you play defense, you'll know how a defender thinks Now, get up! Get up! - Please! - Now, come on - I said, get up! - Ok, I'll come ' During school and college days...' ' We raised hell together, here, there and everywhere' ' There is none like us all over' ' There is nothing that can break our friendship' ' There is no one like my friend' ' There is nothing greater than friendship' ' There is no caste or race in friendship' ' I have nothing to worry when my friends are around me' I scored nine goals in a match for Francis Club, Pondicherry National record National selectors spotted me and took me directly to the Indian camp I progressed over two years and became the Indan U 21 captain 2012, U-21 junior world cup... tough practice session and I met no one for four months That's when... Move. Move! Bro... None of our players are selected Not even Azhar They rejected all of us Have you ever seen any of the players in that list? It's quite evident! Let's leave No, I cannot leave! It's because we are used to leaving , we have nothing How long do you think they'll cheat us? Let's go confront them today! We'll tell Prabha as soon as he is back Only in our nation games are not taken so seriously There is a network everywhere to commit organized crime We read a lot about corruption and bribery in news... we feel for our nation and move on! Who do you think is the nation? It's us! We are unknowingly destroying ourselves - Sir... - Yes Azhar... The list is out My name in not there in it Azhar, I know you are a very good defender I have no idea on what basis the selectors are selecting Selectors come from different state I cannot influence them Last two years, I understand. But this year you were the defense selector Your friend caught the attention of national selectors and got directly into Indian team And you all wanna follow his foot steps? Then what are we here for? You think you can question me? - All I want is justice - Justice? What does your father do? He is a fisherman - Own boat? - For lease For lease right? Don't you wanna own a boat and prosper in life? Go help him instead why are you here?

Guess what Race! We have no idea what is coming here. Even the government is not telling us The ground is what matters the most to usl. The ground is our identity Stop it!

Don't you sow the seeds of evil in these youngsters Sir, I'm worried. Do something If nothing works out... we'll bring in religion! International matter... You get out! Who are you to kick me out? Don't you ask us to stop talking about caste You and me belong to different religions This is our country. You go back to Pakistan! - Please dont' fight - If you keep creating issues like this... Told you! Religion! ' We are divided by caste in here' ' We are united by poverty and injustice' ' No matter how much we protest, justice will never be served' ' Who's the angel? Who's the devil?' ' Only the corrupts proper here' ' What is that drives us to be selfish?' ' Nothing but our own discipline' ' This is the land where you sell your vote' ' I am a publice servant' ' But all you want is money and where do I get so much money?' ' I am the smart one here' ' And so I play double games here' ' Rise!' ' Do you realize your mistake? That is what is destroying you!' ' Even the common has turned greedy and it's so embarrassing for the whole nation' ' Everyone thinks why I alone should be honest and genuine?' ' Moving on has become our habit!' ' And thus begins my reign!' ' My political reign' ' Wait and watch, we'll all fall' ' Money, race, language, religion... dividing is quite easy here' ' You become slaves that will carry me on your shoulders' ' An ocean of slaves and all I need is sentiments to control them' ' I am the modern Loki! Trust me and you'll be a fool' ' All I want is the power and nothing else' ' Every new term I will come to power and give you freebies even if you refuse' 'Because I am the modern king' ' You are the one who is fooled here' 'Because I am the modern king' ' You are the one who is fooled here' ' You trust everyone and every word' ' You fall for all the traps of the politics' ' But remember, no matter whatever happens' ' Don't you fall, oh brave-heart!' ' Even if you fall, do not fail!' We must not spare anyone! Come on! Stop it! What are you gonna do? Huh? It's our emotion that has got us here All these blood shed, war is not new to me It's a common sight in the boundaries We sacrifice ourselves to save our nation from the clutches of other nation But when your own men do this to you, all that sacrifice is meaningless! So, shouldn't we protest against such people? Why? If you want a solution, do not think from your heart Think with your brain Sir, why are you stopping him from revolting? If we don't revolt against corruption then that's the biggest mistake we commit We must revolt but what matters even more is the way we do it! Why are you worried? Aren't you going to settle down in France? You will educate yourself here... but move to US and Europe and toil hard for them Then once in a while through social media... you post what's wrong about our country and how it must change We keep repeating "' Give me hundred youths and I'll change the nation' said Swami Vivekanda" But nothing has changed Today, India is the top country that has the most youth population across the globe But nothing has changed! Why? Because judging is easy Reforming is the hard part Just shouting out 'We need change! We need change!' won't work To bring about a change we must be the change! Each and everyone of you must be the change The ground is important to me but equally important is all your safety Go back safe to your homes Leave! The press is here That will be taken care of Don't worry. Greetings - Wait. He'll come - Greetings Why is he so restless? That's because he is an government official Chief will take care! Don't worry. You proceed Wait. Calm down. Don't create a commotion Drop your mics. Turn off the cameras. Have some coffee then I shall give you the interview Come on We are best at hospitality - Check if they have turned off their cameras - Sure Yes, they have Who the hell do you think you are? What do you want? Carry a camera mobile and you call yourself the media? Post video calling out for help to save our land... and you all go berserk! Make other like, share, comment and subscribe to your channel and also drive them berserk But what's the benefit out of all these? Nothing will happen! Got it? A new protest will take over the spotlight from the old protest. Simple! Guess when our people were at peace? When there was one channel with news once in a day Everyone paid attention to all the issues that was spoken off But today? There are 24 channels having breaking news every hour round the clock So people are least bothered now They don't pay attention to any protests They'll forget this one too! Tell me this. Any national channel here? Only the local channels are here Leave the ads on top and bottom of the screen, how much do you think the viewer will watch? Why do you guys even want to cover politics? Just play songs, sitcoms, reality shows and get done with it If you guys again run behind this ground, hockey and news related to it... I will cancel all your licenses! Got it? - Get lost! Get lost! - Calm down, chief - Ask them to leave - Leave guys Leave! No coffee for you! Leave! Dear... I know you all will do anything for your friends Ain't this grandpa your friend? It's this friend's request. Do not give up the ground Promise you won't give up the ground! Please promise me! Give me your word... Sir, why are you dejected? We feel really bad Advocate told us... it is enough that we win the first match of the tournament And we'll get back our ground We believe in you! We are sure that we'll win it! The ground is ours! The police arrested the lawyer for supporting us This isn't any normal tournament It's a national level tournament They have 1000s of rules and regulations! Will they ask for a lot of money? How much will they ask for? We'll sell our wealth to save this ground This is the holy ground where Lt. Sir Aranganathan played We must not give it up at any cost! - What do you all say? - Aiy-aiyo It's not as easy as you all think Just a minute Hello Amidst all this protest, you registered for the tournament, is it? Registration? Don't act like you don't know Stop kidding Prakash Shanmugan sir! Sir, application has been submitted and registered You may verify once Next 28th is our first match! We are winning it! Kathir, they can't understand but what's wrong with you? You very well know that every team must have one national player National? Sir, we have got international player! 'In friendship, we trust!' ' Oh! My dear friend!' ' Push us down and we will rise up' ' We will burn like the sun' ' We will beat the evil...' ' and find our way to our destiny' ' There is nothing we can't achieve' ' So, let's be together in this fight and win it' ' There is nothing we can't achieve' ' So, let's be together in this fight and win it' Master seems to be an expert in the game Master! What is it Prabha? Why don't you play in the team? It's been five years since I played Same here Come, we'll practice and play ' Come on, Prabhakara! Don't give up!' ' Come on, Prabhakara! Don't give up!' What are you guys taking care of? You just make false promises! Calm down. Why are you getting all riled up? Sir, if they win and if we lose that ground... This is the Pondicherry sports minister, Harichandran - Tell me, sir - Hope you got the information Please take care of it Sir, I did get the information But the tournament fixtures are ready And everything has been published It's tough to eliminate a team now I am the minister! I do understand but please put yourself in my shoes and think Get lost! Hang up! He seems to be a tad scared I gave it a good thought Let's take the route you mentioned That franchise to players deal Let's deal it in a legal way What's happening? Why is it so hard to control one person? Just finish him off! Sir, he'll finish us off Ok, so what's the plan. Tell me Sir, we can win if we can get four national players to play for us Eight national players out of which four are from Punjab Couple of them from north east A mini Indian team is playing for us They can have 1000s of outstanding players... but we have understanding players Friends We have something that they don't possess Chemistry Let everyone stick to their positions We can win this match Lets practice Yes! We must not spare him! Forget the match, sir You are gonna win the trophy itself Long live our leader! They must lose! Lose in a very bad manner! And let's finish him off at the ground Dhyanchand tournament's first match is about to kick start in sometime You must be surprised to see so much crowd for a hockey match. There is a reason behind it Because the honor, valor, respect and reputation of a whole place lies in this match If Aranganathan club loses then they will remain a under performing club And they will lose their ground. Hence they must win Talk about the sports minister and everyone know they don't much about the game But here, we have a well educated minister Welcome sir! Thank you for coming Why is there another statue of him here? Not just here, where ever hockey match takes place in Pondicherry, his statue will be there So, the match is about to start. The umpires are here Followed by the players Today, there are many Indian players from different part of India playing for Francis club Aranganathan team is full of raw talents The whole team is dependent on Captain Prabhakaran So, Prabhakaran has already captained the Indian junior team The match is underway Francis club captain Pranav makes the first pass Francis club passes are perfect Their game shows their maturity The red team is playing in 4-4-2 formation An attacking format. We can expect many goals today Yellow team seems to play like a boy band They seemed to be confused. They are all over Francis team advances through the right wing. Can it be a goal! No! Wow! Watch captain Prabhakaran Bravo clears the field, the ball rolls on Francis team is pressurizing them on one hand... on the other hand the coach is hot headed Let's watch what Aranganathan team does Five minutes into the match... the yellow team didn't even cross the half line once They seem to be happy in their own part of the ground Is the yellow team playing hockey? Or is it Kabaddi? Don't you feel so? No matter what, they are clearing the ball very well Correct Vijay but look they passed it back to the captain If the ball keeps finding the captain all the time, what can he do? Won't they play if they knew how to play? Note it, that's their strategy Vijay! So far not even a single goal has been scored All of them are defending and the captain is guiding them well Let's see how long they can defend Look at them! Look at play so close and united like a party Why are our players spread all over? Sir... they are playing the game wrong Our team is playing the correct game 20 minutes into the game and still no goal Even though unorganized, the yellow team seem to make it work Well Vijay, I think they are changing their game plan Looks like they heard you. The coach is calling them up Go long. Go! I guess coach was furious and asked them to play properly Very good move by Francis club. They are passing the ball over a long distances They are stretching the field, guess that's their strategy Beautiful, could it be a goal? Prabha, defense mode! So far the yellow team players were playing close to each other Just one shot and everyone's dispersed Once again they are into the D line and there he makes the pass What will Prabhakaran do? They miss him... then a pause and now he crosses over Is that a goal?! No way, yellow team did that by mistake Red team is back to form. I can sense a goal! I guess the Aranganathan team is confused by Francis team's game plan I can see the yellow team stumble Spread across. Come on! That was a perfect loft. Only the goalie is at the goal post - Awesome opportunity for the red team - Must be a goal! Goalie stepped out and fell down! It's an open invitation and here goes Prabhakaran with a last try And it's a goal! Well deserved goal for the Francis team Well deserved? It took 25 minutes for them to score a goal! I'm sure now they will pile up goals Captain's face has gone dull Why are you fighting among yourselves? Notice Vijay, captain Prabhakaran is still encouraging his players You appreciated us but the coach seems furious Will he slap them? He is asking them play calm and relaxed I wonder how everyone understands the coach expect the player who talks to him But you are correct Look how calm the coach and captain are handling the team They are passing negative and clearing with the D line. This is not in the right spirits! Ball out! Starting again from the 25 yards line If they pass it properly, they can score a goal The red team have covered up the D line Poor yellow team are struggling Prabhakaran is instructing everyone but he is missing the position Uh-oh the red team captain has gone free The ball is approaching the red team captain but an excellent snatch by Prabhakaran! It's a huge counter pass. All strikers are free. Will he hit it? Fantastic! Well received One on one with the goal keeper Return pass! Well stopped! Goal! Fool! The Aranganathan team supporters have gone berserk Asif is shooting all of them who mocked him Also thanks his captain for setting up the goal for him Good pass! Vijay, yellow team is back on track The coach seems to be furious at the captain for letting a single goal Francis team is a strong team and might have thought of winning without conceding a goal This goal has stunned them It was 0-0 at 20 minutes Now, it's 1-1 at the 27th minute. They seem to give a good fight The yellow team is slowly starting to play the attacking game That was an excellent pass. The captain dribbles it and again a good pass Well received and smoothly going forward That was an unnecessary tackle! There are chance he might receive a red card They are getting physical! The players are behaving out of control Will it be a red card? Just a green card You said referee was on our side? Then why did he give him a green card? He should have got a red card! But since referee in on our side... he gave a green card which is a warning He'll be back in the game in two minutes You're too good at such explanations! Francis club coach is calling his captain Pranav. Must be some special instruction Guess they are planning something big If referee had given the red card during the first time, this wouldn't have happened Captain Prabhakaran has received the ball He keeps advancing as he tackles everyone on his way. Excellent game Whoa! Again a foul! And this time Captain Prabhakaran is the victim Francis club are playing the rough game! The referee is upset Confirm red card for Pranav Why did he give a green card to the yellow team? Was the referee sleeping? I'm sure the yellow team will be all riled up! No one can be more patient Three times the same incident occurred and card was given to wrong team They must be upset right now! Pranav just got a yellow card I wonder if it's the right decision Prabhakaran is unable to move! The coach is charging toward him Guess it's a serious injury because Prabhakaran isn't even getting up even with help Prabhakaran is hurt Wonder what they'll do without Prabhakaran. First aid team is here Fans are completely disappointed He can't bear the pain. Here comes the stretcher Looks like Prabhakaran cannot continue playing anymore in this match Wonder how this team will manage without him. He was leading them very well This was unexpected! Sir, as far as I know... He is done for! That's all! See that, Aravind? The most important player in that team! Got rid of him! We got our men set everywhere! Sir... Fool! Fold your hands Act smart. Don't you see cameras are on us? Now let's sport a sad face It is quite evident that Aranganathan team is struggling without Prabhakaran They seemed to be confused Foul by Bravo! Chances are for a penalty corner Referee raised his hands. Penalty corner it is! Yellow team is already under lot of pressure It's quite evident and now this penalty is added pressure The coach asking him to be patient and calm The red team seems to have covered the complete arch Yellow team players are inside the goal post like a flock of hens Will Francis club take advantage of this or will Aranganathan club stop them? That was a good pass and good stop. Will he now pass or go for the goal? Wonderfully rotated! It's a drag flick! It's a goal! That was hit with a great power! Finally the red team feels like they have done something worthy They are ecstatic! Poor yellow team. They seem to be dejected We can see that the yellow team's coach and goalie are all teary eyed They are quite upset The coach is very very upset They need a comeback! Asif is leading the team in the absence of Prabhakaran They have state players but I wonder if their experience will be enough Its quite evident that Asif is not finding it easy to lead Let's see if Francis club will take advantage of it I'm sure the Francis club will try to score few more goals! The disappointment can be seen in the Aranganathan club's coach's face They are passing the ball in full force, they are charging for another goal Can they score one more goal? Just miss! It hit the post or else it was a sure shot goal That was an excellent pass and play by Francis club and the ball went past Guna They have got the ball into the D line, a fantastic shot... It's a goal! The plight of the yellow team is quite sorry This is a tough situation as they have scored three goals Yellow team has only one goal to their credit Red team is rocking! Aha! Now this is way out of the line They are acting cheap by mocking at the opponent team captain Lat minute of the first half coming up Asif is charging down with the ball. This is an attacking attempt We have seen many last minute goals. Can Asif score one? He missed it. An opportunity gone begging First half is up, there goes the whistle Aranganathan club 1 and Francis club 3 Francis club's domination was quite evident in the first half Aranganathan club must comeback with a bang in the second half Captain Prabhakaran's absence can be heavily felt by the Aranganathan club Let's wait and watch what happens in the second half Left forward, over here Prabhakaran cannot make it Hey! What happened? What happened now? Remember what Prabha said They can have outstanding players from all over India But... you all are understanding players And friends Coordination is very important You know how important this match is Hope you remember the riot that happened the other day How angry were you back then? Remember? Vent out that anger here! Two goals Just two goals We'll draw this and we'll go for penalty Come here Will you be able to do this? Yes sir Louder! Yes sir! Louder! Yes sir! The Aranganathan team is starting upbeat in the second half Aranganathan team must win this match! They have conceded three goals but scored only one They can equal only if they score two goals I can see a positivity in Asif Looks like they have stepped in with a new strategy An excellent save by the goalie and Asif cleared it beautifully Why do they gather at the back and keep playing from there? Looks like they aren't interested in scoring See, even you are getting it now They still don't get it. Fools are still defending Aranganathan club are playing well They are playing by forming the half court press formation But this can only help them prevent goal but not score one Asif who scored the earlier goal is also defending I wonder how they are gonna score the rest two goals? That was miss pass that went away Aranganathan team seems to change their substitute Only twenty minutes to go and now they wanna change the sub? Sir... Sir, Prabhakaran... is ready to play - Looks like they are planning to win - Funny! - Pandi - Sir? Use your experience Don't let them score goal A change in the Aranganathan club.... Pandian is taking the field Looks like an attacking player Looks like they are replacing another sub They announced that #7 in coming in Who is that jersey #7? Who is it? The crowd is chanting Prabhakaran's name. It'll be nice if he makes it But there is no chance at all, as he is injured Prabhakaran's absence can be felt by the crowd too Guess he heard you! He is back! Encouragement is very important and the crowd is encouraging Prabhakaran What can Prabhakaran do? Though he has all the support can he perform to his full capability? That's a bold statement by Prabhakaran but hitting with the stick on his injured leg The audience are cock-a-hoop! Looks like the yellow team is going to rock for sure! He is being over smart. He can only limp, he can't play Step out Sri! Prabha we got 20 minutes, make use of it Sri comes off and Prabhakaran gets in That was a swag entry by Prabhakaran He takes back the captain's band from Asif and captain Prabhakaran is all set! Will Prabhakaran play defense or... will he attack? Attacking formation and Prabhakaran is playing forward I can feel the tension in the air because even I'm excited Last twenty minutes to go Can Prabhakaran bring about any change in these last 20 minutes? Everything rests on his shoulder! The whole people are awaiting to retrieve their ground back A good stop by Asif and he passes it! And the ball is received by... Captain Prabhakaran. He keeps advancing Francis club is trying their best to stop him but wow what a play He is nicely sneaking away with the ball Will do it himself or make a pass? Goalie charges in. Will the goalie stop Prabhakaran? Will Prabhakaran score a goal? Nice fake by Prabhakaran! Will he pass the ball or... will he attempt the goal himself? Its a goal! After a long time Yellow team has scored a goal after Prabhakaran's entry That was just awesome! The audience support hasn't gone in vain Yellow team that was looking lost earlier is now back in full form For the first time the red team can be seen worried Their coach is also giving a lot thought on strategies. The score is 3-2 It's a close call but the yellow team are in the game for sure The match restarts... Yellow team is back to form as Prabhakaran is dominating the entire ground So, we can expect another goal for sure! It's 3-2, one more goal and it'll be 3-3 The coach of the red team is in deep thoughts Wonder how they'll pass the instruction but the red is now passing the ball Finish it! Will the goalie stop this. He is charging forward and a save! Pranav would have converted it to a goal if the goalie had failed Already 3-2 but 4-2 would be a major set back That was an excellent stop by the goalie The stop was good but he isn't getting up Looks like he is injured. Pranav is calling up the referee The goalie is lying still Yes, its indeed an injury. First aid team is here If goalie can't make it then Aranganathan team doesn't have a sub goalie Wonder what Aranganathan team will do without a goalie Any sub goalies? We don't have any sub goalie in the bench No other option then? Sir change a player to goalie? Only goal keeper privilege allowed Goal keeper privilege... a player can be the goalie without the goalie padding Only advantage is that if ball hit a normal player on the body, it's a foul... But it won't be foul if ball hits privileged goalie within the circle Sir, pad? Bravo, come here Look here We don't have sub goalie, so its privilege goalie Goal keeper privileges only. You're the goalie Goalie? Myself? Listen to me Hold this Be confident Was this your plan? Wait! Wait! Holy guacamole! How can you trust me with this? Bravo Wait! Can't even wear the jersey Coach they made me the goalie Get me the pads You know the rules. No padding allowed Only goal keeper privileges Give me the helmet Only this? Bravo, quick! One minute A little down Coach head guard is here, what about abdomen guard? You're a strong man Bravo. I know you can do it Nothing is impossible Go or else I'll bash you up All set? Just one more goal Bravo! Just one more. Come on Where are you going? To the goal post Come here - It's over there! - Oh! Go! Don't worry about it It's ok even if we get red card We were praising the Aranganathan team... but their goalie is down Let's see what they'll do. Asif has the ball... He passes it to captain Prabhakaran and he advances Can he again score one more goal? But the Francis team players are charging towards Captain Prabhakaran Let's see how captain Prabhakaran tackles the ball and the opponents! Wow! The yellow team started as if they were playing Kabbadi but now it's more of rugby! Pandian is looking with the look that says 'You can't see me' Shoulder 143 inches! - He seems to be giving them an earful! - Take him away! I don't think they will mess with him again Someone give him a jersey Red team will now be very cautious Yellow team has bounced back really well Someone go help the injured! Forget all that. There is not proper goalie. Try to score and take a lead Got it? Now run! Run! Last 15 minutes, let's see what a goalie-less Aranganathan team can do An excellent play by the Francis team But the goalie prevented the goal Bravo! Again he prevents the Francis team from scoring a goal Bravo is preventing all the goals without wearing any pads! Let's see if Bravo can stop this. This is a good attempt! Bravo stopped that one too! Bravo has stopped back to back goals This is a shocker as evident from Francis team coach's reaction Alex receives the ball and passes to Asif... Coach tells Asif to pass it Prabhakaran is playing in the forward Asif has locked it and it's a long pause Will the ball reach the striker? Prabhakaran is rushing forward! He is tacking the ball and advancing really well He's handling the pass from captain really well. An excellent chance to score Only the goalie is there. Aranganathan team must use up this chance! Will Vino shoot at this point? Once again foul by Francis team and the audience are disappointed Captain Prabhakaran is also venting out his emotion This could have been a goal A beautiful chance missed Referee must have given them a penalty stroke but he has awarded an penalty corner Aranganathan team is all riled up! But referee's call is the last call In order to play the penalty... Aranganathan team is getting ready All of you attack at once Go! Go! Go! Though it is an unfair decision for Aranganathan team... but Prabhakaran will definitely convert it into a goal We all know Prabhakaran is a penalty specialist Will he convert this corner into a goal? Can he level the scores to 3-3. Let's wait and watch Prabhakaran has taken the position. He will score is what I think This is the best chance he has to level the scores to 3-3 Prabhakaran has run down to pass some instruction No, in fact they are swapping the position I wonder why Prabhakaran would take this risk at this moment Because he could have used his experience to score from this penalty He hands the opportunity to another player Everyone's tensed This is their best chance to level the scores I wonder why are they risking it? Prabhakaran pushed the ball and it's stopped Vino is nicely dribbling the ball through the D line Vino passes and Guna receives Will Guna shoot it? No! He passes it The ball is now with Prabhakaran and it's a goal! Prabhakaran's team is celebrating it in a grand manner. The scores are 3-3 If they can score one more goal in the last minute, they can win it and win back their ground They are rocking it down there! Wow! The stadium looks so beautiful right now! They can't keep celebrating. They must use this one last minute to score a goal Or else the score will be equal and they'll have to go for penalty shootouts Aranganathan team is all pepped up If they can score one more goal then they can defeat Francis team and win their ground Look, don't worry One minute, let's not take any risk No matter what happens... Nothing is impossible Only one minute to go Just waste time Just keep passing the ball around Time to vent out all your anger We must win! ' In friendship, we trust! In friendship, we trust!' Yes! ' In friendship, we trust!' ' Oh! Dear friend...' ' I will never give up on you' ' Come on! Come on!' The whole scene is upside down compared to the beginning Yellow team is fully confident Red team seems to be on the back foot This is already a good result for the yellow team Last one minute ' Even if we fall, let's become a seed' ' And raise like a tree' ' We'll be nurtured well because...' ' In friendship, we trust! In friendship, we trust!' ' In friendship, we trust!' ' Oh! Dear friend...' ' I will never give up on you' ' Come on! Come on!' ' In friendship, we trust! In friendship, we trust!' ' In friendship, we trust!' ' Oh! Dear friend...' ' I will never give up on you' ' Come on! Come on!' Back then when this land faced an issue... my dear friend, you were stepped up! Today these guys have stepped up! Tomorrow someone else will step up! When a friend is in trouble, definitely the other friends will turn up! In friendship, we trust! In friendship, we trust! In friendship, we trust! ' In friendship, we trust!' ' Oh! Dear friend...' ' I will never give up on you' ' Come on! Come on!' Long live Minister Harichandran! Long live Minister Harichandran! Long live Minister Harichandran! Long live Minister Harichandran!
