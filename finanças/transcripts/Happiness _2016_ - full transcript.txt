Boss! What's up? We're low on noodles. What do you mean? I don't have enough for four orders. Ask 'em to order something else. Is this your first day on the job? Do this and... Voila! Stop being a moron! Lay off the horses. We have starving customers! You'll lose your pants and toil over a stove for life. After going through hundreds of Chan Fung, I finally found the right one. His number is 53015370. Hello? Hello! Dad. It's Yuk. How did you get my number? Through the Internet. It wasn't that difficult to find. How long have you been here? With your Mom? She's dead. What happened? Lung cancer. I told her to quit smoking, Can you join me in paying last respect? She won't listen. What? Later, when I'm not so busy. I moved to Hong Kong. I can be reached on this number, write it down. I can see it on my caller display. Got it. Can't talk now, I have work to do. What happened? I went for a breather. I'm asking about my bell. I chucked it. What? It has brought us great business since we opened back in '93! You mad? It's not the bell. Business is good because you're a magician, filling 10 orders with one. Don't get smart with me! Hey! Why did you serve him? He said he was thirsty. I told you to drop dead, did you? Didn't say I want a drink for free. That should pay for the bell too. Go screw yourself! Fuck you! You little shit... Come back here! I'll wring your neck! You've dropped... Your denture. Where are they? Where are my eggs? Don't you want your oranges? What oranges? I'm looking for my eggs. There are no eggs. Give me that! Oh my God... Where are they? Are you sure? Be quiet! Fine! Keep looking! I bought them there, help me find them. Come with me! Forget it! Just go and buy some more. Are you serious? They cost a fortune! Prices of eggs have tripled in a month. Then don't buy them. But eggs are my favourite. Here we are. Next time ask your kids to shop with you. You can't manage on your own. You're not helping me? Come on! Are you leaving? Yes, I'm all packed. I left the key on the dining table. Drop by for dinner. Whatever... Take care of yourself. I will. Remember to come for dinner. Okay. Your daughter? No, she's my tenant. She's moving out all of a sudden. My knees are killing me. It'll rain soon. I'm great at forecasting weather. Come on in! The weather is changing. Where do you want these? Anywhere. Young people now are so tatty... Help yourself to a soda from the fridge. Why do you need so many eggs? What? They'll go bad after a while. Two eggs a day, I'll soon finish them. Have a seat! Gotta split! Sure! - Young man! - What? Come. You're tall enough... A light bulb in my loo needs replacing. You're such a pain! Watch it! Try it. Let me see... Perfect! Fuck! Shit! You're so clumsy! What now? What? It's definitely broken. It's no big deal. The screen is shattered. Give me your number. I'll call and see if it rings. This will cost you! What's the number? 6999... 6999... is inauspicious... 2424 is even worse! Just make the call. Get a luckier number. See? I's ringing. Will you pay for the screen? Can we split 50 50? Are you nuts? I didn't dropped it. But I helped you with the light. No way! I have to cook. You leave now! I helped you with the eggs and the light. Come on. - Come on. - I'm starving, I need to cook! Get lost... $500... Go! Don't be ungrateful! Don't try to con an old lady. Wasted my soda. You should have finished it. "Chan Kai-yuk, pay your rent!" Hello? What? Where are you? I'm home. I just finished dinner. I'm nearby. Good! Bring me some fags. Nah! Why not? I just don't feel like it. Hello? Now what? I could have brought some drinks. Go buy some now. Why don't I move in with you? Why? My cousin from Macau is visiting next month. Mom wants me to share my room with him. What's wrong with that? It's inconvenient. Why? He's after all your cousin. I'll be transferred to Mongkok soon. If I move here, I could sleep in everyday! Isn't that nice? For you maybe, but not for me. Don't you want to see more of me? What the fuck? I was sacked today. I won't be able to afford my rent. I might have to move out. Cut the crap, you just don't want to live with me! It's the truth. I don't fucking believe you. Don't fucking bother! Fine! I'll never come up again. Where's my bra? I'm asking you, where's my bra? What do you take me for? I'm talking to you! Hey! I'm talking to you! Screw you! Shut up! You're hurting me! Beat it! My shoes! Give me my shoes! Just disappear! Shit! Not again! Shit... More food down the drain... This is such a waste! I may have to break my lease and move in with you. Well... No? My girlfriend is such a pain, keep checking up on me. I regret giving her her own keys. I'll figure something out myself. Why don't you call your Dad? I did. What did he say? Said he'd visit my Mom later. That's it? What else? Ask him to cough up some dole! He may think I'm only after his money. What else? Paternal love? When did you last meet? Five years ago. We were to have lunch. He didn't show up, even changed his number afterwards. See? What has he done for you as a father? When he felt like it, he brought you two from Guangzhou. On a whim, he shoved you back north. That's not entirely true. After the divorce, mom wanted to live in Guangzhou. I wanted to go with her. Who paid for her funeral? All by yourself? She was his wife. Are you done? I'm sleepy. Who asked you to wait? Go! I kept you company all night. Now I'm dismissed? You just sat there playing games. What else can I do? Crawl under the car? I'm done. Bye! Call me! Are you trying to pick a fight? Who's picking a fight now? I promote Woodsberg beer, but you're drinking... The sight of you makes me puke! - Fuck you! - Go eat shit! Are you Chan Kai-yuk? So what? Come back! He's over here! Stop! Stop running! Stop! Stop! I've called the police. Pay up! Careful, asshole! What the fuck? Cool it! Why were you beaten up? I can't pay my rent. I can patch you up, but don't ask me for a loan. I'm Kam. But to some I'm Camp... I'm Yuk. That's a cool name. Call me Kam, though. Water... Her name is Flora. Here, here, and here... All messed up. Just ignore her. She sneaks in the moment we open, and is gone in no time. Make yourself home. I'll go change for work. You're a cook? I don't look like one? For how long? Here? It's my fifth year. Free meals? We are government subsidized to provide cheap meals for low income families. We also help the homeless. You seem well qualified. I just want to know if you're hiring. Come again? Are you hiring? Hello! Remember me? It's you! You just returned from a trip? How nice of you! Yes, straight from the airport. Come on in! Okay. Close the door behind you. Okay. Have you eaten? Not yet. I'll get you some rice. I can help myself. Don't just eat vegetables. Try my fried eggs. They're great! Have some... There's too much sauce! Is it good? You live alone and love to cook... You should recruit a lodger. I used to have one, treated her to six courses every meal. She adored my cooking! But she quit on me suddenly. Yes, I know. Oh, you do? Here... Eat some more! The eggs are good, right? Delicious! Eat... I'm tired, leave now. Let me finish this episode. What are you doing? What do you want? What do you mean? Did you steal from me? Don't be ridiculous! What else are you conspiring to do? What were you thinking? I didn't steal! I'm calling the cops! I'm innocent... Leave now, or I'm calling 999! Are you crazy? I didn't steal from you! Leave! I didn't steal from you! Beat it! Or I'm calling the cops! Alright... Leave! Go! But I have nowhere to go. Don't you have a home? Mom is dead and Dad abandoned me. I used to live by myself. But I was sacked. I can't pay my rent. But you could afford to go on a trip... I couldn't, it was just... Don't lie to me, asshole! I went for an interview, but they won't hire one with no fixed abode. If you let me stay, I'll have a job and I can pay you rent. Wouldn't that be nice? Hello, Police? What the hell? - Warned us about con men like you. - "Police Call" Please don't do that! I want to report a scam... Don't call the cops! Send someone over! - Iâ€™ll leave! - Help... I'm leaving! Lunatic! Doctor... Doctor... My Mom is in pain, help her! We tried everything. Just keep her company. But it won't ease her pain! I know how you feel. Gather your relatives to say goodbye. The number you have dialed is not registered... This is your room. Don't touch any of my stuff. Come with me! You can use the living room until nine. But it'll be locked up at night. How should I address you? Call me Aunt Fanny. Thank you, Aunt Fanny. Don't mention it. You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours. Make yourself home... But be punctual with your rent. No problem. Chan Kai-yuk? Hello, I'm Fong Lai-mui, your supervisor. Call me Miss Fong. This way please... Did Kam tell you we're understaffed? In addition to your kitchen work, we need help with our outreach program. We're going to the market today. You can go take a look. Xiaoyue! Miss Fong! Come meet our new colleague. Chan Kai-yuk works in the kitchen. Hello! This is Xiaoyue. She's from the Mainland to study social work, and interning at our center. She'll lead the team to the market. Ask her if you have questions. Sure. Get to know each other. Hello, Miss Yue! Call me Xiaoyue. We all learn as we go along. You'll get used to it. I need to return to class. Auntie Kam! Yes? Anything for us today? Tomatoes? Good! Thank You! Here's some scallions... Thank you! Want to give it a try? What have you got? How about string beans? Hand them over. - Thank you! - You're welcome. You can be more pleasant. Thank you! We're done! What happen to unsold vegetable? Straight to the landfill. Surprised? Is today a good day? Not really. Isn't this job too tough for a girl? When many have little to eat while others have too much, you will find it all worthwhile. If you stop goofing with hands in pockets, we won't have to work so hard. She's right, it is hard work. Sorry, I'm in a bad mood today. I knew it. You must be having... My period's not until the end of month. So watch out. I'll make a note of that. You can ask me anything. Are you seeing someone? Show time! Here's your last chance! Confess... You asked for it! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I went to Zhongshan Lately. Have fun? I just came back today. Come more often, or I'll miss you. Start eating. - I want to go home... - Where are you going? I want to go home. - Finish your meal first. - I want to go home. Please take your seat! Gently! My wife can cook better. Take it easy! My wife can cook better. How come? Don't you love scrambled eggs with tomatoes? No, it stinks! How come? Jerk, why need mistresses when you have a wife, and have kids out of wedlock. Damned if I'd met someone like you. Can we let some air in? Watch out, don't break it! The window is already broken. Not until you tried to open it. Why do you always watch ATV? What's wrong with ATV? I never watch anything else. Move over! You're hot and sticky! Really... Everything here is broken. And the chair is squeaky. Get new ones. I'd sooner get a new head for you! These antiques are worth a fortune. Don't ask for my help when you fell off it! You're a loud-mouth piece of shit! Time's up, get out... You need to check your sight. It's only 8:45! Even this clock is broken. Get out! Scram... Get a new one if it's broken. I'm not made of money. The number you dialed cannot be connected, please leave a message after the beep. Yuk! What? I made rice porridge for breakfast. Get up! Is this a joke? Where's the rice porridge? Yes, I even put in extra... beancurd sticks and gingko nuts. Yes, but where's the porridge? I'd forgotten the rice! So rice porridge this is not! I tasted something burnt. Just a little. I got up early for you, stop complaining. One day you'll burn down the house. And leave you homeless... Xiaoyue is nice, go for her. Is she seeing someone? She's unattached. You're sure? Trust me! Go for her! What are you making? A rabbit. A granny was born in the Year of Rabbit. This is her birthday present. I'm a horse. Can you make me one? I teach an origami class, you can sit in if you like. Maybe later. Biscuits for lunch? I don't eat much for lunch, but more for dinner. That's good. Let's go out tonight for movie and a meal. If it's just social, I'd say yes. But if it's a date, I want you to know I already have a steady boyfriend who's a lawyer. You get the drift? Yes! I'll go and finish my lunch. Well? She's taken. I knew. That's not what you said! I love to see you get kicked in the stomach. Come on! I flirted with her before. She turned me down. Bitch! Look, this one is different. Dry hair, circles under her eyes... It tells you that... She seriously needs moisturizing. You'd chase anything in a skirt! Do you know our center's motto is to cherish and accommodate? But how do we accommodate? Flattery is a form of accommodation. And if my libido rings a bell, text me a message in support. I just adlibbed, hilarious or what? Can I have a smoke? Where's your family? I need my pills... I need my pills... Why? Are you sick? I need my pills... Want some of this? Take more. - Take some eggs. - Come again. Bye! Can we have some morning glory? Of course. They can be stir-fried with fermented bean curd. Morning glory... with fermented bean curd! It triggered something from the past? About your Mom? Mind your own business! Can I help you? Your chairs are very expensive. Yes, rosewood furniture are pricey. Do you buy old furniture? What have you got? It has this thing in the middle, a bit like this. Do you know how old it is? Maybe decades... It could worth something. You're home! This TV set is huge! I bought it. - I got paid. - Really? Yes! Here's the rent. Thank you! It is so slim! It's the best. I bought it for you. For me? Yes! Why? In gratitude. You took me in, I should buy you a nice gift. Don't be silly! I mean it! This is a 3D TV set. You'll need 3D glasses! - It's pitch black! - Do you like what you see? Isn't it great? Geez! Things are hurtling at me! That's how 3D works. I don't think it's for me. Give me my remote. Here's a new one. If you want to watch ATV, just press 11. No, you press 2. That was before. ATV is now digital... It's on channel 11. No, channel 2. Not any more! Now it's on channel 11. What a pain! I want my old remote back. It doesn't work with the new set. Give me a break! I want my old TV set back. I junked it! Why did you junk my TV set? I told you to leave my things alone! What's your problem? What's wrong with the new TV set? The old one was so bulky! You want ATV? Go watch ATV! I can't work the buttons. How hard can it be? Press 1 twice for 11. But ATV is on channel 2. But ATV is on channel 2. Are you stupid or what? If you can't master the remote, quit watching! I really can't manage. I didn't forget on purpose. One plus one equals two, not 11! What's your plan for today? Nothing. Come with me to work. No! There's nothing to do here. So what? Patrick, this is Aunt Fanny. We're playing with mosaic tiles. Would you like to try? Sure! Take a seat. Your daughter? No, she's my great granddaughter. You're so blessed... Thank you! - Say hello to Auntie. - Hello, Auntie! You're so pretty! Auntie, when are you going to die? Don't say that! I'm sorry, please forgive her. It doesn't matter... Listen... It doesn't matter when one dies, as long as no one says "good riddance"! How could you say that to a child? - Did I say something wrong? - It's not nice. What's not nice about it? Yuk! Miss Fong! Patrick said you brought Aunt Fanny. Yes, has she been caught smoking? No, are you related? She's my landlady. Does she have a family? No, is there a problem? She seems to have very poor memory. Old folks are like that. No, it's not the same. Has she ever forgotten to turn off the stove, or burnt her food? Yes! She may have cognitive disorder. Commonly known as dementia. So? She ought to be examined. I'll prepare a referral. What are we doing here? Body checkup. - Hello! - Doctor! Hello, Granny! Call me Auntie! Hello, Auntie! We'll do a simple MMSE test. Okay? Don't worry. Just answer my questions. Let's begin. What's your name? Tse Yuen-fan. What's today's date? Today is... The 16th. Of which month? August. It's October! Don't prompt her. Let's do some arithmetic. We'll start from 100. What's 100 minus seven? 100 minus seven is... 93. 93 minus seven? 93 minus seven... is 86 86 minus seven? It's 7... 76! 76 minus seven? 76 minus seven is... Really? Fold this paper for me in half, twice. You've only folded it once. I'm going to tell you three things. Parrot, guitar, radish. Parrot, guitar, radish. Remember them. I'll quiz you later. Sure... Now, let's try something else. I have some puzzles. I want you to reassemble them. Each puzzle is made up of four pieces. Just like this picture? Yes, you have 60 seconds. Go! Go and drink some water. I'm not thirsty. Wait outside for me. Needing 24 points to pass, she scored 20. Treatment should start now. How long will it take ? There's no cure for cognitive disorder. At worst, she won't be able to look after herself. Medication can slow her degeneration. She must take her dosage on time. She mustn't forget to take them, or to overdose herself. Her family must be clear about this. Here are some pamphlets, on how to take care of the patient. Wait here! I'll hail a cab. Where are we going? Where are we going? I go to work after taking you home. Go if you're in a rush! I know my way home. Where are you going? Don't worry, I know my way. Mister, where am I? The Elements Mall is that way. Where do you want to go? Where are you? Not sure, but I'm surrounded by building sites. Calm down! Read me the nearest road sign. Okay... "to Macau". Macau? Stay where you are, I'm coming over. Aunt Fanny! Yuk! You said you're going home. I thought I'd go for a stroll. Do you know where you are? Kowloon. Yes, but which part of Kowloon? Is Kowloon that big? How would I know which part of it? Where are you going now? Home. Come with me. I'll take you home after work. Come on! There's no cure for cognitive disorder. At worst, she won't be able to look after herself. You think she'll notice I'm gone? Do you care? She may forget her medication. Do you care? She once walked for hours without finding home. Nothing more you could do for her. Let me tell you this... A friend's father has dementia. He doesn't even recognize his own kids. Once he threatened to hack them all to death. The sooner you split the better. Now she can still care for herself, what if she pees and shits in her pants, you'll be fucked. Stop asking for trouble. Yuk! I made dessert, want some? Yuk! Turn it off! Let's chill out over hotpot. Or do you want Chiuchow food instead? Say something. What do you like? It's Aunt Fanny! Pull over. Don't worry! They are both unscathed. I used to roam the streets when I was a kid, staying out till very late. Just like Aunt Fanny, Mom would look all over for me. Where were you? I went for supper. Why didn't you answer my call? Did you call? I muted my phone. I thought... What? Why leave an octopus on your head? Go and rinse it out! You'll give people heart attack with your look. What now? Water... Xiaoyue! What do you want from me? I think you owe me an explanation! I told you time and again, there's nothing between me and Jennifer. I found this in your car. It's not mine. It doesn't mean it's hers! I often give clients a lift after meetings. It could belong to one of them. Give it to me. Do you think Jeff is lying? I don't know. Don't ask me. I am confused. I need your advice. - Anything for us today? - Not today. That's alright. Have you met the girl? I went home early one time. Jennifer was sitting in the living room. Jeff just came out of the shower. Said she was his new secretary, there to collect a file. Was he wearing a shirt? I don't think so. Were they having an affair? You tell me! Anything for us today? How about some hairy squash? Sure! - Take four. - Thank you! - Thanks! - Welcome! You're keeping your view to yourself. But I don't even know him. Just go with your instinct! Instinct tells me you could love him more. Why? Since he has denied wrongdoing, why choose to doubt instead of believing in him? Any veggies for us today? Celery and Chinese cabbage? - Great! - I'll get you a catty. What can I do for you today? I sold you two chairs a while ago. I don't see them on display. Sold them a few days ago. Really? Who bought them? A Japanese tourist. He liked them so much, didn't even haggle. Feel free to browse! You think that woman will survive? Not the way she was ran over. I know her face. But not her name. That's Flora. She walked around with a huge plastic bag. The number you dialed cannot be connected, please leave a message after the beep. Hello? Hello? This is Chan Fung, who is this? Hello? Who is this? Stop this prank! I'm calling the cops if you call again. Have you taken your medication? What for? Because you're not well. Since when have I been ill? Your supplements... I took them this morning. But not tonight. I did too. You did not. I did. Are you being difficult? I did already. Where's the remote? It was here just now. Where is it now? You've lost it! Told you not to leave things around, you never listen. It's just a remote. What's the big deal? How can I switch channels? Then don't! And watch ATV forever? Be considerate! Don't be nasty! I don't want to watch anymore! I don't know what I am doing here, taking shit from you! Don't you know you're sick? Oh really? See? You don't even know! You didn't even notice I sold your chairs. How could you!? You sold my antique chairs!? Yes, ages ago! Oh no... I should have run off with the money. But I was worried about you. I don't want to leave you all by yourself. At least I'd know if you had dropped dead. You're just teasing, right? Don't leave me behind. I don't want to die in solitude. I don't want to die in solitude. Stop crying! Wipe your tears. You are staying, right? Sorry, I'd a rotten day. Please don't go. Here's your remote. Have fun with it... Hungry? Are you hungry? Let's go for a bite. Sure, my treat! Did I do okay? Yes, very nice. - Thanks! - Keep it up. Aunt Fanny, find yourself a seat. Go on! A friend just opened a restaurant. He needs a sous chef. Interested? I like it here. Why should I leave? Why don't you give it a try? I've got work to do. I've made up with Jeff. That's great! I want to go home... Uncle Shing! Come this way... I want to go home... I want to go home... Take care of these too. Sure! Thank you! She'll say we need to order more oil. Kam, we're short on oil. Order more. No problem! How did you know? It was a coded message, means she wants to have sex again. Miss Fong? We did it last night! It's true! Trust me! Want to hear more? Not really! I'm always happy to share with buddies. I am pleased for you. Okay! What about you and Xiaoyue? We're still good friends. So what? Miss Fong is my boss, but I slept with her last night. Do you know her mouth was wide open when she slept. She was drooling all over. And her snoring... Was thunderous! You've been dying to know, right? She was really petty. Who's petty? Miss Fong, of course! Don't you want to paint a vase? It's not too challenging. Did you study painting? I don't need to, it comes naturally. I could tell! Do I have to paint a vase? No, anything you like. That's a nice poster. Can you hurry up? You're always so slow. What's the rush? I'm not in a hurry... What are you doing? Changing the sticker. I thought you had shattered your screen? What's this? A spatula. What else do you need for cooking? Pot, I have loads of them at home. Hurry up! Why didn't you cross? I couldn't! You could if you'd hurried. Now stay where you are! - Let me help. - No, thanks. - Come on! - Go away! Is it ready? - Try them... - Great! It's pipping hot! Let's see... - Is it good? - It's delicious. - Really? - Yes! How come yours is different? Really? Xiaoyue! Yuk is partial to you. Can I have a taste? Aren't you supposed to be helping? You're doing just fine. I'm not cooking tonight, you're on your own. "Beware! Broken window" What's this? A washbasin. It's prettier than the one I have at home. "Is there a cure for dementia?" You'll miss work if you catch a cold. Look at you... Quit smoking. You're coughing your lungs out! Kick it. Don't forget! Why do you smoke, then? If I quit, will you? Have some chicken. He can't take a joke. Just teasing... I'm getting rid of this. It's gone! Fatty, what is it? I found your old man's shop. It's in Shamshuipo. Wait for me! Harder! You hit the hoop. Come... Shoot from here. Yes, use your wrist... Feel the rhythm. Can you see it moves? Let me show you. You suck, too! Show me. Thank you. Let's see... What would you like? How about this? - |'had one when I was small. - Sure. What color? Blue. I like blue. I'll get one for you. - Here. - Thank you. Enough? More. - Does it taste good? - Yes! What else do you want to play? I want to go home. Let's play some more. I want to go home. Look, I'm not your father. Throw a tantrum and I'll smack you. Go play by yourself. Where are you? Aunt Fanny wants to go home. Look after her, I'll be back soon. Kam said you took off without a word. Where are you? I'll tell you when I get back. Aunt Fanny. Where are you going? I'm going home. Yuk will be back soon. Please wait. He doesn't have to come. I know my way home. No! I'm working late. Can you keep me company? How's my kid brother? What has he eaten? Ice cream. Does he have any food allergy? I don't know. But as his brother you must know. Is the boy you admitted your kid brother? Yes! Can| see your ID Card? Where's the Emergency Room? - Over there! - Thanks! Are you crazy? Calm down, sir! Or we'll have to charge you. Couldn't you have just stayed in China? Let me sort this out. Is he your elder son? I have only one son. Chi-chun. Mom! Dad! Is he alright? It's just common food allergy. He had a reaction because he's also asthmatic. But he's fine now. He can go home now. - Thank you. - Thanks! You scared me to death! Didn't I tell you to avoid peanuts? I forgot. Were you bullied? Who gave you this? Brother won it for me. You don't have a brother. Listen carefully. Sort this whole mess out. Or else don't bother to come home. Let's go. We don't want that. It's filthy! Yuk... - And who are you? - We're friends. I'm trying to unravel their relationship. If you're not family, sit over there. How long do we have to wait? It shouldn't be long. Let's take a seat. Chan Kai-yuk. Mr. Chan will not press charges. We'll treat this as a domestic dispute. But he wants you to stop calling him or bothering his family again. If this happens, he'll call the Police. Is that clear? That's outrageous! What kind of a man would disown his son? Answer me. Do you understand? Tell him for me, I'll never contact him again. Mr. Chan, I've spoken to your son... I mean Chan Kai-yuk. He promised not to bother you or your family. Thank you, officer. You may go now. Patch things up, okay? "#18743, 3 F, Diamond Hill Columbarium" How long do we have to wait? Who knows? "Dad" Shall we go home? In this world, no one is in-disposable. I've lived alone all these years, and I'm doing just fine. He didn't even save my number. He has never wanted me around. If you don't have him as your father, you still have me as your Mom. Be a good boy, okay? Now, let's go home. After a good night's sleep, you will wake up a new man! Be good. What up? Where's your kid brother? He's gone! Gosh! Life is so fragile! He's not dead, just went home. That's outrageous! Who wants an asshole like him for a father? Am I right? Let's go celebrate with a hotpot! We go home. But I haven't eaten. We go home. Let's go home first. Yuk... Go home and have a good sleep. I'll make you rice porridge tomorrow morning, you go to work after breakfast, okay? What's-his-name... Aunt Fanny, for the last time... My name is Fatty. Fatty, where are we going? Ace of Spades. Jack of Diamonds. Eight of Hearts. Remember that. I'll ask you later. What was your first job? What did you do? My first job? I sang at the Golden Crown Nightclub. No way! You're a cabaret singer? That's right. Sing something for me. Not with this voice now. We had to drink with patrons back then. Toasting was bad for vocal cords. I sang nine shows a day at my peak. I was too greedy. I sang until I lost my voice. And then? Then... I drew movie posters. Stop pulling my leg! Heard of "As Tears Go By'? "Peking Opera Blues"? "He Lives By Night"? I drew them all. I bet you haven't seen any of them. Do you have a wish? I actually have two. I've always wanted a son. You're about as close as it gets. And? And... I don't remember. That's okay. Remember these cards? This one... Ace of Spades. Correct! This one... This is... Is it a face card? Yes! Jack of Diamonds. Well done! Last one... This one... It's red... Eight of Hearts. - What? - You didn't pay! I did! It's not your first time. You do this every time... I took my purse out. You're giving me a nervous breakdown! So desperate you had to con an old lady? What is it? I paid, but she said I didn't. She didn't pay. Trust me! I had $100 on me, see? I swear, I'm not lying. I'll be cursed if she had paid! I'll get run over, 20 times over. I pay. Calm down... - Did I pay her? - Of course you did! I'm sure I did... Four tomatoes for $10. This is $5 each. Green onions are $8. What about eggs? How much are they? Sorry to keep you waiting. According to the Land Registry, the property was first owned by Luk Koon-wing. It was transferred to Tse Yuen-fan in 2000. Aunt Fanny, did you know Mr. Luk? He owned the nightclub where I sang. The flat was bequeathed to me before he died. As far as I know, you suffer from cognitive disorder. I understand everything you said. I'm very clear-minded. Let's talk about the title of your flat. You live alone as an elderly in your own property. If you're unable to look after yourself because of illness or old age, the Government will put you in a home until you die. If you do not have a legal heir, the flat's ownership will go to the Government along with the rest of your assets. Do you understand? Mr. Fung, I want to draw up a will today, and leave everything to Yuk when I die. Aunt Fanny! Don't interrupt me! Or I won't remember what I'd wanted to say. See... I forgot already! Right! I have one condition.. You must look after me like a son until I die. Are you willing? Why are you doing this? You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours. Aunt Fanny, why name me your beneficiary? Who knows what will happen? I can't take it with me if I drop dead. My old boss gave me the flat, I should leave it to one closest to me. Done? Nearly there. Hold still. There's a box wrapped in floral paper... This one? Yes! You released an album? I'm not sure if I really did. Before the LP was released, the record company went bust. Anna Chu? My producer wanted a catchy name. Can| play it? Of course. Where must I go to find myself? The past is but a faded memory, I'm lost in pain. Where must I go to find myself? Let bygones be bygones. I won't get lost. I don't want to dwell in infatuation. I don't want to be sad and lonely. I've found my long lost past. Looks like Dad was here. He has a conscience after all. I met someone 30 years ago. Charlie was a saxophone player. We're made for each other. He loved to hear me sing. He proposed soon after we started dating, wanted me to join him in San Francisco. But I couldn't bear leaving Hong Kong. So I turned him down. A friend told me a few years later, Charlie drowned in a boating accident. His family scattered his ashes in the ocean. Yuk, when I die, don't bury me. I want you to scatter my ashes at sea too. I want to be with Charlie. It's slippery! Walk with me. Why so pleased with yourself? Thanks a lot! Okay, bye! Come on, hurry up! Go ahead. I'm right behind. Let me take that. No, you'll get wet. Come on! To alleviate arthritis and osteoporosis, you ought to drink more milk. Occasionally. Don't complain about you aches and pains. Listen more to people. Drink more milk! I'm here for a job interview. Fill out this form. You're here for the sous chef position? Yes! I heard there's only one vacancy. I think so. Out of ink? Yes! I'm done, you can use mine. Thanks! Bye! - Looking for Xiaoyue? - Yes! She wanted me to give you this. - Where is she? - She left and went home to Guangzhou. She told me to give you this after she's gone. Thank you, Miss Fong. Yuk, I meant to say goodbye, but never quite summoned enough courage. I lived in Hong Kong for a few years and I love this place. It brought me many happy memories. But, of course, there are sad ones too. I believe in destiny between people. Too bad... Jeff and I are not meant for each other. But I'm glad that we met. Since I first saw you in the hospital, judging from your love for your mother, I knew that you're a kind person. Want to hear a song? Scared of infection? No. Who's this? - A good friend. - He's out of tune. Yes, but I can tell he's sincere. I need a drink. Want one? No, thank you. Though you always acted cool and aloof, maybe you have yet to find someone who understands you. Everything in Hong Kong, especially meeting you and Aunt Fanny made me realize something. Life has different stages, we must learn to cherish without regrets. My grandmother is old. It's time to go home and spend the remaining days with her. - How are you, Grandma? - I'm good. To me, this city may seem distant, maybe even lonely. But as long as you believe, you will find the warmth that belongs to you. I'm sure you can too. Brace yourself, Yuk! - Good morning! - Good morning! Try my fried eggs. They're good. Mr. Chan, looking for a massage? Do you want to try my "daily special? On the double, okay? Our restaurant is still hiring, want to come? Didn't I tell you that Fong is petty? When do you start? Next week. This is just your sanctuary. It's time to move on. For you. What's that for? Onion, just in case you want to cry. Funny, right? You're gross! "Press 1 twice for ATV" Hello, Yuk? I was working and missed your call. What's up? Really? Did I call you? I wonder why? Probably to ask if I'm coming home for dinner. Right, that's it! I'm on late shift tonight. I'll bring some snacks, okay? Good ideal Wait up for me. What are you doing? I'm painting. Good! Enjoy yourself! Bye. Sure! Bye!
