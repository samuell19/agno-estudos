Cop's word of honor That's what he says every time. He Is making progress. A little more effort and he will succeed. In a thousand years that is. Director: Jos? Pinheiro Which one of you is prettier, huh? -Are you afraid? -Just try it again. Marc! I don't like it! Nobody actually forced you to come. Marc, I don't like all that stuff you're in. -I never lied to you about what I did! -Yes, but I didn't know it was like this. All right. Relax. Close your eyes. In 3 hours we'll be lying in the sun. Here you go! Come on! Oh, shit. Look! Done! Pratt! Myl?ne's dead. Waiting for you in Lyons. I'm with you! Reiner. Don't cry! Let's go! Will you be gone for long? -As long as it takes. -l'll be waiting for you to come back. Let's go! Pratt! I'm very sorry! He's a nice looking guy. He quit the police 10 years ago, but they still remember him. -Was he fired? -No, he resigned. - Why? - I guess he couldn't just stand aside. lt's something they didn't like much at headquarters. - One must adapt. Yeah... or disappear... Iike the dinosaurs. Meet inspector Clement. She's in charge of the case. I'm very sorry. -Will you give me a lift? - Wait! Clement wants to talk to you. - I don't feel like talking. - I will talk, Monsieur Pratt. Look, I want to get some sleep. And I presume our talking will take some time. Excuse me. I just want to show you something. The same weapon? Yes, SPAS-12. Franchi SPAS-12. 22 victims in 3 months. None a single survivor. No witnesses. Who are the victims? Traders, dealers, bums. Almost all the murders were committed in the Magrettes area. What else have you got? No motive, no connection between the victims. Let's me guess. The investigators have testimonies that will shed light on these events. How old are you anyway? 24. Why? Just asking. You think you can do better, Monsieur Pratt? I fully trust her. She knows very well what she's doing. Go back to the island. It won't do any good if you stay here. You're just torturing yourself in vain. I know, St?ph. But what else am I supposed to do? We'll find them. You have my word, cop's word of honor. Just stay calm. You have my word, cop's word of honor. Join us for dinner. I'll introduce you to Dominique. - Dominique? - My wife. For what? Are you nuts? I pay in cash. - What's wrong with you? - Look at your stuff. It's been opened 50 times. - I have never opened it. - l'm not buying your stuff. You're nuts. Come on. I don't care about that. Done! Have a seat! So you're no longer a cop? And you're no longer in jail? I've paid in full. Me too. Do you still trade in arms? That's over and done with! Five SPAS-12's. In the hands of five bastards. I told you, I quit. - You were desperate. - Yes, I was. SPAS-12, a very powerful weapon. You must have noticed. Five SPAS-12's. I don't know his last name. Only his name. It's Abel. We always met behind the police shooting range parking. Put something on. You'll catch cold. Hi guys! - Here comes our handsome! Hi Abel! - Hi, sweet! -Haven't the guys arrived yet? -No, you're the first, as usual. I'll fire a couple of rounds till they get here. -How much do I owe you? - 4.50 Thanks. - Well? - He's here. - Here? Where? - Behind you. Don't turn round! What does he want? He doesn't like us getting rid of the dregs of society. He wants to kill us. - Then we'll finish him. - No, leave him to me. He's mine. I'll take care of him myself. You just go away quietly. There's a lady waiting for you in the bar, Monsieur Pratt. You play rugby in a suit? No, I take mud baths for rheumatism. Wiith your clothes on? I'm a very busy man, you know. Are you on duty? I was thinking to invite you to a concert. But I guess it's already late for that. Commissioner Reiner asked me to look after you. I don't think you'll sit by. We'll see. Let's suppose you'll be the fiirst to fiind them. Will you just start shooting at random? Depends on the situation. I won't let you do that. Will you strangle me with your stockings? I won't let you do that. I know. -What are you doing? -Going to bed. Another dolce vita. Less gin, more martini. Let's go to the next bridge. Why don't we just ask for a transfer to the River Squad? Thanks buddy. I don't know anything. I'm an inspector, not a probationer. Find somebody else to follow him. We have nothing on him. He is engaged in jogging, swimming and boxing. Doesn't see anyone, doesn't talk to anyone. Excuse me. If he has made up his mind, he'll find them. He doesn't have more information than I do. But he can find it and blow up the whole city. His daughter has been killed! Where are you going? I need to do some washing. You? Yes, it's me. The flower shop was closed, so I plucked some nettle. I hope l'm not disturbing you. Yes, you are. I need to hide my lover in the closet. If I ask you what you're doing here at this hour, will you consider it as an interrogation? No! Of course not. I was actually looking for a quiet place to get some sleep. So why here? Well, so that you can look after me. Have you found something? Let's say, they have found me. -Pratt, you must... -No, Sabine. It's you who must trust me. I need your help. Those bastards have killed my daughter. I know, Pratt. But it's not that easy. If you want to stay, I can offer you a cot. -What? -A cot. Cot? All right. Nothing to complain of. We're at war, after all. What war, Pratt? Mine. Let's tell each other about ourselves. I have a small fishing business. 5-6 boats. I also bought one of the two bars of our island. Why did you quit the police? I've heard something, but don't know if it's true. My wife was killed 10 years ago. They found the guilty one, but then let him go. No evidence. And what did you do? Nothing. I handed in my weapon and together with my daughter l moved to the edge of the world. I couldn't take any risks because she only had me. She studied in France for six months and came to see me on the island. She lived like a princess. Everybody loved her. And now you've decided to play kamikaze? Yes. I feel like a spring, which has been stretched for 10 years. -Pratt? -What? Do you feel comfortable? Very. -Pratt? -Yes. I feel lonely. Me too. How stupid, isn't it? Looking for me? I think he's looking for me. Jean-Paul, are you coming? Finish him and let's take care of the others. For Christ's sake! I beg you! This is the moment of truth. Be a man at least once in your life. Take a good look at me. That brunet is Patrick. Was mixed with stealing paintings. Many cases were built against him. I was trying to catch him for an entire year. But not like this. I see. The press will claim again they did our job. Send it to the lab. Send us a fridge for at least 15 bodies. Notify the Service of Communications that sanitary works are to be conducted. I asked you to stay out if this. Don't teach me, OK? I don't know how you managed to find them, but you'll have to tell us everything. I don't understand what you're talking about. What's your angle? Huh? Relax, inspector. You're on duty. Just go on with your investigation. But you could get killed! Are you nuts? You know what time it is? I forgot my documents inside. What else! Please. See? You can be polite if you want to. Bastard! Are you angry? You'd better leave this place. I know. I was actually going to move tonight. It's not the apartment. but this area of Lyons. That's enough, Pratt! Otherwise you're risking to start something you won't be able to stop. I promise you, l'll find them, and they will receive the extreme penalty. This is the extreme penalty. Pratt! If you leave know, we'll never see each other again. Who knows? May be you'll be the one to cuff me. I hate you! I hate you too. Take a break for 5 minutes. Come on. Move it! I saw the boss today. He said not to act without a warrant. What about that guy? You think he'll stop. If he's out to kill us, he won't be reconciled. Besides, he has seen me! He has seen me. His eyes, his stony look. Don't you have a file? What file? Police file, you moron! What else? We're closed. It'll only take 2 minutes. That's enough for today. You can go, Patrick! Get out! Good-bye, monsieur. These are your guts. Your bean. Your balls! -Did you understand? -Yes. I can't breathe. Not quite. I like your store. Reminds me of my childhood. Life line! Show me your life line. Show me! Now you're going to tell me the names of your friends. I already know Abel Salem. The three are left. -Hello! Who's it? -Anonymous call. Pratt, where are you? Pratt? I don't know anyone with that name. If I were you, I would go and see the store owned by certain Sylvain Dubor. If you're a friend, then you probably know Pratt. May be. Tell him I miss him. I'm sure he misses you too. Yes? OK! Tell him l'm coming down. My baby girl. I'll kill them all. I could arrest you. Two days of detention would be enough to collect the evidence and bring charges. If you were in my place what would you do? I wouldn't want to be in your place. However, you were right. Sabine Clement is a good cop. You know, sometimes I was so much fed up with this damn job that I wanted to find you by a postcard. For ten times I wanted to write you - 'Hi, it's St?phane, l'm coming!' There's nothing to prevent you from doing that, St?ph. Nothing. Come whenever you like. I'm always glad to see you. Go home, Pratt. Nothing good will happen to you here. Wait, St?ph. We'll see. Inspector Moreau. How is he? There's already no need to worry about him. We gave him a sedative. I'll try to ask him a couple of questions. I'm not sure he'll be able to answer. I injected morphine to him. It causes sudden bouts of laughter. Don't worry. It won't take long. Abel. What the hell are you doing here? What are you doing here? It's not safe to stay in this hospital. Abel, don't try anything. I've brought for you a new remedy. In the dog pack the wounded are fiinished off. Is that you, Mendez? Yes, se?or. If you feel giddy, you shouldn't have built that high. I think you're mistaken. You're indefatigable. I'm not here to argue. But l'm unarmed. So was my daughter. You're doing good. Where did they teach you that? In the Bolshoi Theater? I have a black belt. I have to warn you. It's not fair. There's cement down there. Almost no chances? You'll be a cripple for the rest of your life. A nobody. Ten fingers. Ten fucking little fingers. You think you can make it if you have two on each hand? Shall I hang on for dear life? - Drop your weapon. Police! - Fuck off! Let's go! Monsieur? - Did you operate on her? - Are you a relative? Yes, what are her chances? I'll be able to say that only in 48 hours. It's amazing how she survived. Finally they got that car fixed. And now for all the rakes of Navi club! Fasten your belts, it'll happen unexpectedly. The slow foxtrot which l'm about to present to you, has a feature. Your body will be covered with pimples. And now let's try this. It's good for blood circulation. You won't do that! Nobody wanted to shoot your daughter. Abel forced us to. What if I tell you the name of our boss? His nickname is lra Deum - the wrath of God. I can find him myself. I'm returning this to the sender. No! Super! Let's do it again! anything wrong? You think l'll just let you look down your nose at all this from your pedestal? - I will not allow to shoot myself. - I told you - 'no innocent victims'. And you killed his daughter. Shot a cop. He loves her very much. It was a mistake. Anyway, I always knew that Pratt was out of range for you. Untouchable. And sooner or later l'll have to bring an end to this story. Salem! You'd better put your gun down, Monsieur Pratt? The reason? The premeditated murder of two, possibly three people. Nothing more? It seems more reasonable. It's not the time to rant. I don't think so. Who told you I was going to come here? Commissioner Reiner. He knows a lot of things for sure. Open the door! Go and open the door! They will perpetrate a massacre. Don't worry. 60 cops are not going to change anything. You're risking to blow up the fire, buddy. Excuse me. I didn't do it on purpose. It was an accident. Open that door! -Well? -Open the goddamn door! Now close it! At 60 to 1 against me, you had no chances. Everybody in your cars! What the hell is he doing? Commissioner, Dax speaking. All went wrong. I think he's dead. He threw himself into the Rhone. There was nothing we could do. It's finished! I'll go and have some sleep. You gave in? You're not half the man you used to be, Abel. Fuck you! What are you up to? I don't need you anymore. You're fired. Fuckers! Bastards! -Madame Reiner? -Yes. My name is Pratt. Daniel Pratt. I need to see your husband. I tried to call him at the offiice but he wasn't there. But he's not here either. Please, come in. It seems you're surprised to see me. St?phane told me a lot about you. But the last time he told me you were dead. It's a misunderstanding. Thanks. Why did you want to see him? Just to remember the good old days. You were not even thinking to talk about the good old days. St?phane spent sleepless nights since you came to Lyons. He often says your name in his sleep. So he still manages to fall asleep? St?phane told me you were his best friend. So what happened? The time has passed. St?phane has been playing with fire recently, and it's his problem. But when he gets me involved, it's becoming my problem too. Perhaps I wasn't thinking to talk about the good old days, but I wasn't going to lie either. I only need to talk to him. He's at the circus with his son. - With his son? - I mean with my son. Thank you, madame Reiner. Since we're at the circus, the show goes on! This is the moment of the highest emotional strain associated with this cell. You won't remain indifferent. Since we're talking about lions and tigers. Meet the greatest artist of the French circus - Kid Bauer. - Monsieur, you're not allowed in here. - Take it! -No please. -Just take it. Bingo, you bastard! Are you drunk again? Fuck you! OK. Go make yourself up, otherwise you'll be late. Move it! Get out of my sight! Damn you! He's drinking all the time. Kid Bauer! OK, buddy! What do you think? I need a drink. You'll get the whole bottle. But first let's finish the lesson. Christina Meyer! Ladies and gentlemen, dear children! And now, Bingo the clown with his voracious crocodile. Let's give Bingo a clap! I'm coming, I'm coming! Meet Bingo! Hi, children! Have we been obedient today? - Yes. - That was a good start! Monsieur Lahaio, please keep your comments to yourself! -It's not 'Lahaio', but 'Lahail'! -Whatever! - Have we been obedient today? - Yes! Can't hear you! Yes! - Can't hear a thing! - Yes! Can't hear you! My nose is stuffed up. And you, children? Can you hear me? -Yes! -Great! Then l'll present to you my friend Bibi, the voracious crocodile. Here comes Bibi! Let's give a clap! Bibi the voracious crocodile! And my friend Fotti! Now silent! There's a little problem. Bibi doesn't like liars. He devours them. Are there any liars in here? -No! -What? - Any liars in the hall? - No! No liars in the hall. No liars. I'll have to check. I'll see if there are any liars in the hall. -Are you a liar? -No, l'm not a liar. You're not? Great! OK, you're not. But l'll go on seeking. Got you! -You're lying. So you're a liar. -No! OK. You're the liar! - He's performing better than usual. - Yes, the red wine probably acts on talent. Absorption! Digestion! Monsieur, please! Let's give monsieur a clap. He'll serve to the voracious crocodile for 15 minutes. -I'm scared! -Let's give a clap! My hammer! Get inside, please! Bravo, Monsieur! Go! Go! Abradadi... abradada... abrikak... abracadabra! A sad end to a good cop. There! And now, children, let's count! Attention! A dwarf plus anot her dwarf will be an egg. Egg plus another egg will be capers. Capers plus capers will be an oyster. Oyster plus another oyster will be a chair. A chair plus another chair will be 30 eggs. 30 eggs plus 30 eggs will be 60 capers. 60 capers plus 60 capers will be 120 oysters. 120 oysters plus 120 oysters will be... - Monsieur Lahaio? - 256! There! Suspense! Monsieur? Monsieur! -Where's dad, dear? -He disappeared. - What do you mean 'disappeared'? - The clown enchanted him. Enchanted? Bibi the voracious will incubate him. And then monsieur will hatch. Let's go! See you later, children! What are you saying? Let's go! And where's monsieur? Give me inspector Dax. Yes, it's urgent! I'm Madame Reiner. Don't be afraid. I'm not a ghost. What now? Ira Deum - the wrath of God! Justice got into your head. My plane leaves in 2 hours. Give me at least one reason not to kill you! Five armed young men. Five hunters ready to shoot everything that moves. My personal order. A way to feel yourself less useless and powerless. Do you understand? My poor St?ph! You're completely out of your mind. If it's not taken care of, then after 5 years it will be impossible to go out for a walk in this damn city. I don't care about that. Your daughter's death... I felt horrible too. But you do know it was an accident. I took care of Salem. All the five payed for that. What else do you want? I don't know what l'm doing here. I don't even feel like killing you. Then why do you need all this? When I saw you I thought l'd be able to kill you out of hatred. But as you can see, here I am standing in front of you, and all I feel is the deep aversion. Pratt! Pratt! Since we're at the circus, the show goes on! Music! Shall I hang on for dear life? Come on, come on! Come on, swim! Go on! Easy! There's a wave. Slowly! Slowly! Good!
