[MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Life is a crash course and I'm fallin' hard. Since the day that I was born the devil held my cards. And so I'll burn here on down that line. If you wanna get it over with, stop wastin' precious time. Some days you do, I lie, before he self destructs. Do what I want to, not holdin' back. If I die tomorrow I guess I'll relax. Bring your brimstone, take me to hell. Don't care to live forever, I got no soul to sell. Some days you do, I lie, before he self destructs. If you see me comin', just turn around. Sittin' here close to me just might bring you down. Don't try to save me, I'm doin' all right. [INAUDIBLE],, don't fade into the night. Some days you do, I lie, before he self destructs.

JULIE GREGORY: Well, I'm glad your friends decided not to throw you the bachelor party. I hope they're not too disappointed. BRANDON JACOBS: They'll get over it. I hope you're not too disappointed. Well, it would've been more for them anyway. Besides, I haven't been camping in a while, and it'll be good for Eric and Chase to get out of the city. Well, I'm glad you feel that way. Besides, you're the one I want. Why would I want a bunch of strippers putting their naked breasts in my face? Oh, really? Really. You're the only one for me, Mrs. Julie Jacobs. That's Miss Gregory to you. We're still not married. So that's how it's going to be, huh? Yeah, I think so. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR HORN BEEP] ERIC: Man, they heard you the first time. Give it a rest. CHASE: I just want to go. What's taking him so long? Man, they're getting married in like a week. OK, so just give him a few minutes. He's going to have a lifetime with her. We got to go. Hi, Julie. Are you going to be all right by yourself all weekend? Yes, I'll be fine. Crystal's going to come over and we're going to go over the last minute wedding stuff. That's good. But you two stay out of trouble. Us? You're going to be with Chase, and that's trouble with a capital T. Well, don't worry about him. Eric and I will keep him in line. Mm. [KISSING SOUND] I love you. I'd better go. The native is starting to look restless here. Love you too. Have fun. Bye, guys. Bye. Man, this is going to be great. Me and my best buddies camping, fishing. This is going to be just like that time in Montana. You remember Blackfoot River? Damn, those are good times. Check out this new fishing pole Julie bought me. I can't wait to check this baby out. OK, what's up with you two? You're way too quiet. You don't think, uh, we'd let your future wife there deprive you of a little bachelor party. What's he talking about, Eric? We're not going campin'. We're not? No. Remember, five years ago we all vowed never to let a woman keep us from a bachelor party. That's the best time of our lives. Yeah. But that was years ago. And besides, if I recall, we were really drunk. I knew you'd try to chicken out. That's why we fooled ya. You're not a very good liar Brandon. She bought it, right? If Julie finds out that I had a bachelor party, she'll kill me. Does Crystal know about this? Hell no, man. She'd flip out and go straight to Julie. That's why I told her we're going camping. Oh, man, I don't know about this. Yeah. We've been friends since high school. Now you're gettin' married, the last guy we thought ever make it to the altar. Yeah. I mean, you're the only guy that I know that got fired for screwing every woman in the office. Now you got the weekend to do whatever you desire before you're doomed and never to be with another woman again. Hell, We're never going to see you again. Hey, listen, listen, it isn't the end of the world. Well, what do you say? Eh, you're probably right. You never will see me again, you know. I'll be in there, my wife trying to figure out which romance videos to rent. Oh, and you can forget about the football games. You're going to find someone else with a big screen TV. And the nights out drinking beer, they're over. Yep. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. CHASE: Oh man Eric, thought you'd be mad. Man. No man, you guys-- you guys are my best friends. You went through all this trouble for me. There was no way that I would let you down. A promise is a promise. Now let's quit it with this bullshit, man. There's women out there dying to meet me. [MUSIC PLAYING] Let's go go go. [MUSIC PLAYING] Damn, hello clubbing. Yeah, hello. Lovely. Hey, you guys, you know, I don't have any clothes. Julie packed all my camping attire. Man, don't even worry about it. We took it upon ourselves to buy you a nice pair of slacks and a shirt. You're good. Oh yeah, great. I'm here for two days, I'll wear the same clothes. You're worse than a woman. You can borrow some of my stuff. Besides, this is all you're gonna need. Condoms made for midgets. Yeah, very nice. So what's up for tonight? Well, it's all right here. What are we supposed to do with that? We know how you like to gamble. So we thought we'd keep this weekend interesting. Yeah. We got $2,000. Eric and I affirmed your share. Thank you. He who wins the bet at the end of the weekend gets that cash. OK. So what are we betting for? Who can sleep with the most women in one weekend. No man, I'd win that. Come on. See this bowl? In it are sexual conquests. He who fulfills most conquests wins. Wins. Have you played this game before? No. No. We thought of it on the way to your house. OK, what are the rules? Trolleys, fulfill your conquests. After you're done you got 12 hours to get back here to this jacuzzi. If you're late, you forfeit. Bring proof. Oh, please. How are we supposed to show proof? Because you know Eric always lies about getting laid. That's funny. Funny. Funny. Polaroid cameras, I got one for each of us. OK, when do we start? Do it. Right now. Come on, draw. I-- I-- I will I will. Don't-- just don't pressure me. For crying out loud, man. You're not defusing a bomb or anything like the guys in the movies. Oh, I got to cut the blue wire or the red wire. And if you just grow up everyone says boom, everybody dies. So come on. All right, Jesus. Read it. Never could remember what wire's the right one, though, you know? You're the cop, you got to know. Man, just because I'm a cop doesn't mean that I know all areas of law enforcement. I mean, you got your bomb squad, you got your homicide, and you got-- Pesticide. That, lots. It's the blue one. Come on, read it. This will never happen, OK? OK. Hotel room number 57, bring handcuffs, sexual conquest with woman registered to room. Take pictures You know, I don't even own a pair of handcuffs. Oh. Oh, actually, I have a pair of handcuffs. I-- I never really film without them. Great, I have handcuffs. How am I supposed to pull this off? Just be creative. You can be anybody you want to be. Lie. Come on Eric, it's your turn. Oh, all right. All right. Don't fall. OK. Older woman, oral in the elevator. [CHUCKLING] Like that's going to happen. Oh, lacking a little bit of self-confidence, are we? I don't know. Nope. Nope, just draw it. Draw. Two brunettes in the hot tub. That's going to be easy. Let the games begin. Yeehaw. Yeah, baby. Let's do it. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yeah. Hey man, you guys are on your own. All right. Hey, ladies. He's just-- he's too much. He'll never change. Never. Oh, there she is. ERIC: She's yours. Wish me luck. Get her big guy. Don't get 'em too dirty. [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me, is there anybody sitting here? TORY: No. Do you mind? Of course not. Oh God, I'm so sorry. Did I spill your drink? Yes, you did. Ow. I-- I'm-- I'm really-- I'm so embarrassed. Can I get you another one? No, that's all right. I've got it. No, really, I insist. It was my fault. Besides, I could never stand seeing a beautiful woman buy her own drink. OK it's chardonnay. Great. Aren't you in number 57? Yeah. How'd you know that? We-- we're neighbors. Really? I'm in number 60. That's a weird coincidence. I would never forget such a beautiful woman. Well, you're quite the charmer. How 'bout that drink? [MUSIC PLAYING] It's not my best profile. Woah. Yeah. Oh, nice. Wow. Wow. Eric, uh, where's yours? Well, where's your Polaroid? I don't have a Polaroid. Did you lose it? [LAUGHTER] I failed my conquest, all right. I guess it's a tie breaker between Brandon and I. Yeah, Eric, why don't you just sit this one out? All right. Nope. Look, I may be going down, but I'm not-- I-- I'm going down fighting, all right? Hey, all right, let's draw. Wait a minute. Why don't you and I just split this and end the game? Oof, not a chance, man. I'm going to win. I don't know. Don't you feel kind of bad about lyin' to these women over stupid debt? Look man, your conscience eatin' you? What are you afraid you're going to lose like you always do to me? I don't always lose to you, Chase, OK? It's just-- I don't like messin' with their heads. You know, Brandon is-- is right though. Come on. Look, the people that come here know what they're in for. They're foolin' themselves if they don't, man. They're here just like us, for a good time. Yeah, but women are more emotional than men and we do tend to think with our, you know. What harm could a couple white lies do? All right. Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. TAMARA: Hi, you must be Brandon. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm Tamara. I'm your personal trainer for today. What would you like to get started with? Would you like to do legs, abs, shoulders? I guess little bit of everything. OK. I just thought you could help me. Sure. You know, let me know what you think. Mh-hm. Well, looks like you are in pretty good condition actually already, so you don't need much help. Well, I'm in construction. I keep pretty fit. Great, OK. Well, why don't we start with some stretches and then we'll go from there. OK. All right. Stretches over here first. OK. Get started. Show me what to do. All right. Here, stand here and just kind of stretch out your inner hamstring That would be-- Yeah, kind of lean down this way. Right, exactly. Yeah. And then you wanna do the other side, so you can feel it right here so you don't pull anything when we start lifting weights. OK? OK. Then I want to stretch out the back of your shoulders. It's really, really important. Ow. Nice back. Have you already been working out? Maybe a little bit. Wow. Such a pleasure to have a fit guy instead of these, well, you know-- [CHUCKLING] You are totally in shape already. Why do you need me? You never know. Wow, check you out. You don't mind, do you? Not at all. [MUSIC PLAYING] So after I save the old man from drowning that's when I knew there was more to life. You know, the world just didn't revolve around me. So now I spend all my free time volunteering. God, it-- it's just really rewarding. WOMAN: Wow, that is-- that's an amazing story. You know, I have never met a man that's as brave and sensitive as you are. There's plenty of 'em out there. No. Oh no, there's not. I know. You know, I really like the fact that I'm getting to know you better, you know, outside of the hot tub. Well, it's-- it's all on how you're raised. I just hope one day my kids will love me just like I love my parents. You want kids? Oh man, I love kids. It's just in finding the right woman, you know. Oh, look at the time. It's getting really late and I think I should head to bed I'm not much of the partyin' type, you know? I'm more of a homebody. Me too. You know, would you mind walking me up to my room? Are you sure you want to leave? Look at all these guys out here. I'm sure they're dying to meet you. You think so? Oh my God, you're great. You're everything a guy would want. You're the marrying kind. Besides, I just got over a bad relationship. Right now I just don't think it'd be right. I'll be the judge of that. You-- you and I had so much fun in the hot tub and I'd really like to rekindle that right now. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, where are you going? Oh man, I got some phone calls to make back in my room. You can make 'em here. I don't-- I don't mind. You know, I'd love to, but, you know, my phone book, it's-- it's back in my hotel room. I don't have any of the numbers here. That's too bad, thought you and I could, uh, go another round. Oh God, I'd love to, but, you know, hey, I'll call you. But you don't have my number. I do. Sure, this is hotel room, right, 57. That's your room. Well OK, Mr. Brandon, what'd you say your last name was? Jacobs, Brandon Jacobs. Listen, sweetie, tonight it's a date. I love the way you made love to me. A girl could really get used to that. [DRAMATIC SOUND] Time's up, man. Chase is late. All right. All right. Kiki, you decided to go with the uniform. Whatever works. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Life is a crash course and I'm fallin' hard. Since the day that I was born the devil held my cards. And so I've burned here on down that line If you want to get it over with, stop wastin' precious time. Some days you do, I lie, before he self destructs. Do what I want to, not holdin' back. If I die tomorrow I guess I'll just relax. Bring your brimstone, take me to hell. Don't care to live forever, I got no soul to sell. Some days you do, I lie, before he self destructs. Congratulations man, you win the $2,000. Ah. Chase is going to love that. Yes. Damn. Yep, that's right. Better luck at your own party, loser. Yes. Winner, winner, winner. Yep. Freedom week. Freedom wee-- [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, the big guy finally did it. I think you're up next, Chase. CRYSTAL: Yeah. It's about time I got a ring, Chase. Hey, this is Brad and Julie's day. Let's enjoy their happiness. Don't change the subject, Chase. Yes, Chase, don't change the subject. Hey, shut up. You're just causing problems. Thanks for trying, Eric. We'll take this up later. Hey, shh, Julie's still opening gifts. Oh, look at this one. There's no tag on on it. I wonder who it's from. Well, just open it, honey. I'm sure we'll find out who it's from. OK. Oh wow, this is beautiful. Yes, it is. Let me take a closer look. Wow, it's-- Is-- is everything all right? Yeah. You know, I've just, um-- it's a-- a lot of champagne and I'm feeling a little dizzy. I-- I'm going to get some water. - OK. I'll be right back. K. Hi, isn't this great? Oh my, it is so pretty. This isn't funny. Which one of you sent the bowl? It's just a coincidence. It just looks like the same bowl. They duplicate those by the thousands. It's the same bowl. What are you guys talking about? Look at this. I found this at the bottom of the bowl. That's twisted. Yeah, not as twisted as the person who wrote it. Oh, you think I had something to do with this? Oh, you guys are messed up, man. I didn't do it. Well, who else would do something like this on my wedding day? We're the only ones who know about this. I have no idea. You know, you're such a sore loser, Chase, and it's just like you to lie about something like this. Why don't you just admit that it's a prank and give it up? I said lay off, I didn't do it. Look guys, we were all really drunk. It could've slipped out by any one of us in conversation with any of the women at the club. All right. Let's just go and enjoy the party, have a great time. It's your wedding day. Let's go. Chase called again. Mm, that's nice. He's called several times and you haven't returned his calls. What's going on with you two? Nothing. Been too busy. Too busy? That's not like you at all. You're never too busy for your friends. Nothing is going on. It's just that we're married now, I don't see the need to hang around with Chase all the time. Besides, he'll never grow up. Look, you've been moping around the house all day like a child refusing to take his calls. If he calls again I'm not going to lie to him. Look, Julie, don't do that. I have to do that. It's affecting our relationship now. All right, I'll call him tomorrow. I'll call him today. JULIE GREGORY: Good. Look, I gotta go. Gonna be late. Love you. Love you too. [DRAMATIC SOUND] [PHONE RINGING] Hello, Jacobs residence. SONJA PEARCE: Hello, lover. What? Who-- who is this? SONJA PEARCE: You don't remember, Club Hedonism? No. SONJA PEARCE: Is that because you banged so many women that weekend that you can't remember? Look, I'm married. Just please leave me alone. [DRAMATIC SOUND] KEN: Just got a call from a woman who said that you made lewd remarks to her during a sales call. What? She says this isn't the first time you called and harassed her. She's lying. Do you know this woman? Yes. Well no. I mean it's-- This is a place of business. We are professionals here. This company will not tolerate this kind of behavior. Hey. Hey. You gotta get ready for work so fast. Well, I could be bribed too. Oh. Well, how long then-- how long you got? Hmm. I'm sure I could take some time. Yeah? [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello, Jacobs residence. Hello lover, your job on the line? Look, what do you want from me? I want you, Brandon. I want us to be together again. But that's impossible, I'm married. To that little bitch. Don't worry, I'll take care of our little problem. Look, leave my wife out of this. But she is the problem, Brandon. She's keeping you from me. I'm reporting this to the police. Look, you call the police and I'll tell your precious little wifey how we fucked all night, how you told me you loved me. All right. Look, I am sorry I misled you. It was just one of those bachelor party games. A game playing with people's minds and hearts. I fell for you hard and nothing will stop me from getting you back. You are mine. Chase, I know you're here, man. Man, what do you want, man? We need to talk. Someone's been harassing me. Well, it's not me. Yeah. I know it's not you. Some woman's been calling my house. She knows where I live. She's even called me at the office trying to get me fired. All right. Uh, do you know who she is? No. No. But I have a feeling she's one of the women I had sex with at Club Hedonism. Hey, shh. all right. Crystal still thinks we went camping. Yeah. I know, camping. Do you still have those Polaroids? Yeah, I got those Polaroids. Good thing think I hadn't burned 'em yet. All right, good, because I'm going to need them. What are you going to use 'em for, man? What you going to do, find these women? I don't know. Maybe if I find this obsessed woman I could talk some sense into her. You know, it could even be that trainer because I think she was little out there. Well, how are you going to find out who it is? We have to go back to resort. Hey, what's this we shit? Oh no, no. You're the one who got me in this mess. You're going to help me find out where this woman lives. CHASE: Man, do you even remember their names? We were waged up. Look, you know, Chase, I don't remember their names. That's why we need the Polaroids. Somebody at that hotel has got to be able to identify her. I think we got to get Eric's involved. No, no. We can't get him involved, he's a cop, because this may call for some illegal action. Just get those Polaroids, I'll call you later. Miss Jones. MISS JONES: Hello, I just wanted to welcome you back from your honeymoon. Thank you. I'm sorry to inform you but your assistant Bertha has taken a long extended leave of absence. Oh no. But I've got it all under control. I've hired you a more qualified and professional assistant while Bertha's gone. Thanks. Sonja, come meet your new boss. Julie Jacobs. SONJA PEARCE: Hello Julie. I'm Sonja, Sonja Pearce. Oh, excuse me? WORKER: Can I help you? Yeah, I'm Brandon Jacobs, we were here a couple of weeks ago and we're looking for a few women. Well, you came to the right place. There's plenty of them around here. Look, what he's trying to say is he, uh, you know, slept with a couple women last week. He lost their numbers. He wants to get in touch with 'em again. You know what I mean. No, I don't. Could you just help us out please? Look, I'm sorry. That information is highly confidential. I couldn't possibly give it out. Listen, this is kind of an emergency situation. I'm a married man and I slept with one of these women and now she's harassing me and I think she could be dangerous. I see. Look, can't you just help us out? The man is desperate. Well, what's in it for me? We want addresses, and phone numbers, and any other information you can give us about the women in the pictures. I could get sued for this or even go to jail. Oh yeah, I remember. No, wait here. I'm gonna go talk to gym instructor. The others will have to just pay a visit to their homes. Sure, I'll just be here waiting. Can you take these to room 203 please? MAN: OK. Thanks. Hello, Tamara. Hi, uh, you must be Joe. Your appointment is in about a half an hour, OK? No, I'm Brandon. OK. You don't remember me? Should I remember you? Well, I was here not too long ago. Brandon, the construction worker. Oh, Brandon I'm sorry. It's just that I work with so many men here at the gym, sometimes it gets confusing. Did you want to make an appointment? No, I just wanted to say hi. Oh well, hello. You didn't call me the other night, did you? Uh no but, uh, if you'd like me to I could. Yeah, sure. Here's my card, Brandon. Anytime you feel like giving me a call, feel free. Give me a jingle. Great. I'll call you. Hope so. Wow, nice back. Have you already been working out? Oh, maybe a little bit. Wow, such a pleasure to have a fit guy instead of these, well, you know-- Now it's gotten worse. Julie found a pair of women's underwear and condoms in my car. I mean, this woman is crazy. CHASE: It'll blow over, man. You'll see. Well, hopefully soon. Julie's not talking to me. She thinks I'm having an affair now. CHASE: Don't worry. We'll find this bitch and take her down. I hope so. I'll be sleeping on the couch until then. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? It won't be long. Soon we'll be together forever. This has got to stop. This is not a game. You're screwing with innocent people's lives. I love you, Brandon. We'll be together soon. Pleasant dreams, lover. [HANGS UP PHONE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [TYPING SOUND] Brandon, I just got another call from that woman. She says that she-- Look, I-- I-- I-- I don't know who she is, but I promise this will stop. Just give me a few days. All right, I'll give you a few days. But that's it. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Some days you do, I lie before he self destructs. Gentlemen, what is the deal? I'm on duty. Some crazy woman is stalking Brandon. Look, look, look, let me handle this. Some crazy woman is stalking me. And you know, I'm afraid she's going to hurt Julie. Thinks it's one of the chicks that he screwed over at Club Hedonism. Is this about the vase? Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is about the vase, all right, and the threatening phone calls and-- and all the harassing shit that's going on. You know, she's calling me at work trying to get me fired. I don't even have equity in my house. Why didn't you guys call me earlier? Look, I didn't want this to become a big ordeal, OK, but she just won't let up. Maybe she needs a restraining order. He doesn't even know who she is. Maybe you should call the police. BRANDON JACOBS: You are the police. I-- you know, I mean, you know, we can get surveillance on the house, we can file reports. No, no. I don't want Julie to know about this. You know, she already thinks I'm having an affair thanks to this psycho woman. ERIC: All right. Well, what do you want me to do? Look, I want you to do me a favor. Just keep an eye on the house. All right. In the meantime, Chase and I are going to go visit some women. Listen, if this gets too dangerous, I'm going to have to call it in. K. It just give us a few days, OK? A few days. That's it. So this is your place? It's lovely. Thanks. A girl can really feel at home here. Thanks. You know, I really just wanted to say thanks for bringing me home today. - Yeah. - Yeah. I don't know what's up with my car. I just had a tune up. I'm sure the mechanic will figure it out. Probably. I noticed that, uh, you don't have any pictures of Brandon-- I-- I mean, you and Brandon around here. Yeah. You know, I never really thought about it. I guess I'm just not really the picture taking type. I don't think Brandon is either. Oh, that's too bad. He's such a handsome man. Do you know Brandon? Oh, uh, no. Just from what you've told me and you know-- but-- so what's going on with you lately anyway? You know, you've just kind of seemed depressed at work. Oh, it shows? You know, it's really nothing. It's OK. You know Julie, I've only worked with the company for a few weeks, but I think our relationship's pretty special. I want you to know that you can tell me anything. I know. It's just-- it's really hard to tell somebody that your husband is like having an affair on you. Oh Julie. Oh, I had no idea. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah. I love you Brandon. We'll be together soon. Pleasant dreams, lover. I am so sorry, I probably shouldn't have done that. Um, I actually didn't mind it. It was OK? Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. [DOORBELL RINGING] Gentlemen, can I help you? Oh, it's you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Tory, we need to talk. I can't. What are you doing here? It's about the weekend at Club Hedonism. Aren't you in number 57? Yeah. How'd you know that? We-- we're neighbors. Really? I'm in number 60. That's a weird coincidence. I would never forget such a beautiful woman. Well, you're quite the charmer. How 'bout that drink? Look, I already told you that was a one night stand. I'm happily engaged now. Look, I'm sorry to bother you. It's just someone is stalking me, and I have an idea it's one of the women I slept with at the club. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Life is a crash coures and I'm fallin' hard. Since the day that I was born the devil held my cards. And so I've burned here on down that line If you wanna get it over with, stop wastin' precious time. How many women did you sleep with? Why do you need me? You never know. Wow, check you out. You don't mind, do you? Not at all. Never mind, I don't want to know. But you think it's me? I'm sorry, I can't help you. I-- I hope you can find her. Now if you excuse me. Tory, um, everybody's waiting inside to make that toast. Oh, hi Brandon. You still tracking that psycho female? Unfortunately. Happy hunting. Sorry to bother you. Let's go. Come on, Tory. Let's go, they're all waiting. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Hello, lover. What's it like sleeping on the couch? Where are you? Your wife is very beautiful, luscious I could almost taste her. Leave my wife out of this. Oh, I intend to. She'll be out of our lives very soon and you'll make good on your promise to marry me. I never promised to marry anyone. Who are you? What's your name? Patience, patience. Right now I'm punishing. You've been a very bad boy. You lied to me, and I hate liars. [SLAMS PHONE DOWN] Look, I'm not having an affair. It's just a sick joke someone's playing on me. Who would do such a thing? Well, I have some sick friends. I just don't believe you. Fine. I want you to come straight home from work and lock the doors and don't leave until I come home. JULIE GREGORY: Why? Talked to Eric the other day and there's been a lot of break ins in the neighborhood. I'm havin' him keeping an eye on the house. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? CHASE: Hey, it's me. Oh, thank God. CHASE: We're still on for tonight, right? Yeah. Meet me here at 7:00. Thanks for bringing me home today. I appreciate it. My car should be ready by tomorrow. No problem. You know, maybe I should introduce you to my husband. Let me go get him before he leaves, OK? Oh, that'd be great. Stay right here. Brandon, Sonya, the new secretary's here. I'd like for you to come and meet her. Not now. Chase and I are going over a sales pitch. Maybe next time. She's dying to meet you, hon. Next time, I promise. I'll meet her. Hi. Hey, um, where's Brandon? He's working on a sales pitch right now. He does want to have the meeting with you, but it's just going to have to happen another time. Oh. Oh, I see. So did you guys kiss and make up? [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, well, I'm sorry, I just thought-- you know, I thought you and I could talk about anything. Look, I'm feeling kind of tired. Maybe you should go. I'm sorry if I offended you. I didn't mean to. I just, you know-- Look, I'm feeling really tired now. I think it's best that you go. Julie, I think you're really going to regret this. Goodbye, Sonja. [SIGHS LOUDLY] Damn. Took you long enough to take a leak. Yeah. I was checkin' out Julie's secretary. Pretty nice from the backside. - All right. Look, calm down. We got some work to do. Hey, does she always rummage through your stuff? I don't know, she's new. She probably helping Julie out. You have that woman's address? Oh man, that's at my house. What is it with you? Hey, this-- we're all new to this. Well, let's get going. Here's those addresses. Looks like she's about an hour from here. Man, you think she's one? She's the last one on the list. Maybe she's after the wrong guy. Maybe she's-- What? Well, don't get mad. What is it, Chase? I told one of my conquests my name was, uh-- Was what? Brandon Jacobs. You gave someone my name? What the hell did you do that for? I don't know, just spur of the moment. I just didn't want no one comin' back to me. So, great. So you-- so you-- so you give her my name and she starts stalking me. Well, who was it? - Sup guys. - Hey Eric. What are you doing here? I wanted to know if you guys found the woman yet. Well, it's probably one of the women that Chase slept with. He gave someone my name and who knows what he told her. So do you remember anything specific? [MUSIC PLAYING] Yeah. There was this one girl, man, she had a hot body. I licked every inch of it too. [MUSIC PLAYING] She had this-- she had this tattoo on her leg. [MUSIC PLAYING] Man, it was kind of like that-- the secretary, Julie's secretary. [MUSIC PLAYING] Who? Sonja? That's her name. That's her. We've got to get to the house. Brandon? Brandon, is that you? Brandon? Brandon, is that you? JULIE GREGORY: Sonja? No, it's not Brandon. Oh no. Ouch. I came to get Brandon. I came to get what's mine. Ouch. You're pulling my hair. Ow. You are just too in the way. [MOANING IN PAIN SOUND] Now that should hold you, you little bitch. You know, I'd really like to fuckin' cut you up right now. You've just been a thorn in my side this whole time, I should just cut you up. But I think I'd rather see your brain splatter everywhere. [BEEPING SOUND] This bomb will be going off in about 10 minutes. Ciao. [HANDCUFFS RUBBING TOGETHER] Drop the knife now. Put it down. Put it down. Brandon, I hate you. You can get what you deserve. I'm not Brandon, I'm Chase. I'm Brandon. Put it down, now. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh my God, honey. There's a bomb on the dresser. Do you have a key for this thing? No. Eric, Eric, Eric, there's a bomb on the dresser. I know. Hurry up. I can't get these things off. Thank God. Thank God I never listened to you. - Eric, Eric. - I got it. I got it. - Get her out of these things. How'd you know what wire to cut? I didn't. Sonja's the one that did all this to me. I know. I know. And we got her in the car. Psycho. Ow. It looks like Chase and Crystal broke up. I didn't think she'd be as forgiving as you. Well, she told me that her and Eric have a hot date lined up tonight. Really? Mh-hm. Didn't take her very long It's like Eric turns out to be the local hero all around. Yeah, but I actually feel sorry for Sonja. She must've been pretty messed up to have gone to the extremes that she did. Can you imagine being wanted in five states for the same charges of stalking? Yeah. Well, maybe she was just pretty psychotic. Either way she'll have plenty of time to think about it while she's in jail. So um, let's talk about the sexual conquests. Oh, no, no. I thought we made a deal. Yeah, I know. I just thought that maybe, you know-- maybe I could make you my sexual conquest. [MUSIC PLAYING]
