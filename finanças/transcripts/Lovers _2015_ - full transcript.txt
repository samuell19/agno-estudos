People laugh when I tell them this but... We were filling out the marriage document We didn't want to mess it up so we took our time. It can be a nice time and a chance to talk over things as you imagine married life. My smoking was one of those issues. I wasn't bluffing when I said I'd quit smoking for her. I honestly wanted to quit. We filled out the document and then she took a bath. So I was sitting there alone and it hit me that I was getting married. "Request for an appeal" I went out to the veranda. I lit a cigarette and took a long drag. She came out of the bath and the smell gave me away. It wasn't a good start! I thought she'd get angry. She looked at me. And... She had a kind expression and said "It'll take time to quit." That's what she said and I realized she's happy to marry me too. That's what I felt. I mean... Everyone makes important decisions in their lives. They have to choose schools and jobs... And someone to marry. With each little step you make decisions "The 10th Royal Anniversary Special Princess Masako in Love" Is that her? The Princess! Where? Wrong, wrong! Nice shot! Yes. Don't miss her.

Yes, my bad! - Honey, we can talk it over. - Go ahead! - Not now. - Let them listen! Not now. Too much pickle! Don't put it back, Toko! - Don't take it out on her. - I'm not!

He's an untouchable! He's from an untouchable family! He doesn't care but I do! I went blank but somehow I got to Paris. I was in shock and shaking He should have told me that before we married. He had said we'd have to keep the honeymoon cheap. No one flies coach on their honeymoon! So my parents paid for the trip. Not his family, which gave me doubts. - How long did you know him? - 3 years! And... I left him at the airport! It's too much. Right. It's really insulting. He hid it from me so it's a marriage scam I'm a corporate lawyer so I'd have to check the precedents. Is it a scam? Of course! We'd have to prove that he deceived you to profit... What! He got me! I gave him social status. I'm an anchorwoman! She came home and found him with a woman! Oh my God! This is bad. What? It's like you. Right. Oh yeah, that's right. But my mother-in-law stepped in and saved our marriage. That's unusual. We were close. She helped us when my husband and I had financial trouble. She's dead now. You're crying! I wouldn't cry over my mother-in-law. The invoice. These are breasts. Yes. It's not my order. But... It's wrong. You ordered chicken... We ordered thighs, not breasts. Take them away. But... No buts... Do you understand Japanese? Yes. Yes, but... Toko! What will I do with breasts? It's your order... You made the order, right? Yes. These are breasts. I can't braise these! Oh...but...

Get this! What? He's a moron. A real idiot. Listen. I was walking down the street. Then someone came up to me from behind. I turned and saw this incredibly cute woman! She was amazing... Really cute! She'd approached me as some kind of dare. I was like, "Shit, I'm getting lucky!" And... Hey, listen! She asked me to go to an event. And sold you the water? God, you're stupid. Wait. What do you mean? That's offensive. She wants me to buy more so I will. I love her. What? - It's a scam. - Guys are so stupid. I don't mind. It's fate! I'm going to marry her. I have decided. You don't have her number. Lay off. I'll find her, OK? You were right not to choose a local lawyer. We give quality service. Such as...? Quick responses. Great. How reassuring. Who is she? An anchorwoman. I thought she was familiar. She was French in a past life. I'm serious. She said so herself. Wha...? Are you okay? OK, Atsushi Shinozuka... No health insurance? I had it but I haven't been making my payments. Pay them. So? So? So? So? So? So? So? What the fuck do you want to say? Got something to say? Say it! Weirdo! He'll hear you. You think I'm weird?

"Prescribed by Psychiatrist" Write something. With this pen? It might blur. You gave me that pen. Did I? Yes, when I became a lawyer. I took good care of it. It doesn't work. It's hot in here. Thank you. I didn't have much time today but... I made a quiche. I'll put it in the fridge. Thank you. Can I open it? It's full! What's up with your? It's been a while so he's shy. What's that cut? Were you bullied? No. No way! Bullying is a mass media invention. There are no bullies at school. It's from soccer. You want to be a pro? "Get well soon, Satoshi" No, it's a hobby.

This is what I can pay now. How about next time? - Next time? - Yes. - What... - Next week? Next week? - I can't. - When then? I don't know. Then your health card can't be validated.

I wanted retribution and consulted 5 different lawyers. I paid 50,000 an hour to hear them tell me, I'm broke now so I eat freeze-dried seaweed. You know the one that grows big in water. I went to that lunch place. The hamburger place? Yeah, what's with those huge burgers? Who can eat them? Yes? This is only good for a week. Yes. Is it like 10,000 for a week? Is there such a thing? No. So it's just at your discretion? That's right. Take this too. "Amour Bar" Come on! Poor thing! It stinks and it's noisy. Go on! You know what? Guess what I saw the old landlord doing... From the morning! See you tomorrow! Bye! I go pale when I drink! Let's go for a drink. See you! See you tomorrow. Oh, it's you... What are you waiting for? Excuse me? There! Over there! Keep going! Right ahead! Oh, okay. Right there! There! Stop the bike! Oops! Wait! Catch it! It went your way! There! Catch it! Watch it! Watch it! Whoa! It's flying! You did it! See? Go for it! It's been a while since I worked out. How about whisky with water? I have to go home and make dinner. Bet you can't process a chicken. I'm a pro so I'll do it for you. Oh... Okay...l can pay for it. Never mind. How kind of you. Thank you. Here. Maybe just a sip. Thank you. Well? How's that? It's smooth... Right? That's my water for you! It's 10,000 yen a pop because it's high-grade. Oh, my God That's me. It is too! That's you too? And that one? Oh my God, they're all you! It's you! I was in a beauty pageant. Which one? You can apply it too. See how fair I am? My skin's soft and smooth. Does it have vitamins? It has many things in it. Isn't nature amazing? There are smaller bottles and friend discounts. It's not a pyramid scheme. I saw a chicken being killed for the first time! It struggled so much! The legs are held tight, the neck's twisted and it's over. Twist! Just like that! I was so impressed. Who knows what's in here! A butcher prepared it. What about bird flu and other germs? Don't worry. No germ could kill you! That would be right. His father wouldn't have put up with this. They're old. Really? They look OK. The freeway was built in a hurry for the last Olympics. Wow! They can't afford to build a new one. They just have to keep maintaining it Am I part of the Olympics? If we win the bid. I'll devote my life to it! You don't have to. No? 3 years ago Toru Kaneko was arrested for killing 3 people. His lawyer used the insanity defense. Tokyo District Court ruled that the defendant was mentally ill and advised that he be committed. The defendant, Kaneko, was 34 at the time of the murder. It was July, 3 years ago in a Tokyo street. He killed 3 pedestrians and was soon caught. Judge Noda stated that the crime was heinous as 3 innocent lives were lost. But Kaneko's erratic behavior and mental state were taken into consideration by the judge and he was committed for psychiatric treatment. What did you talk about? Usual things, like... "How's it going?" "You OK?" Hey, watch out! Can you tell? Yes. How do you know? Me? Oh, all right. All right. Got it? Yes. Over there. That a hunch? I used the Force. Kidding. Where is it damaged? Everywhere. It's all damaged. A turtle! There's a turtle! What's going on? Why are you here? You were in a daze.. Was I? Anyone here? No. What's this? It's for you. Oh my God! So many! I'm happy! But...I have no cash on me... Never mind. Really? It's raining a lot. I'll get a towel. What is this? Hey! What is it? No! You can't look! No, no, no! Show me! It's my novel's heroine. A novel? Yes! You're writing a novel? Why does your princess always have diarrhea? You read that much? Wow. I'm a speed reader. I know the trick. Thanks for even skimming it. I wrote 14 chapters but nobody's read them. She won't last 14 chapters with her diarrhea. She's a fragile woman. But the prince will soon come into the story Been here long? Yes. Ever since I got married. What a dead town! How about you? Me? I drifted here from the North. Why? Coz I got sick of everything. There they are. They're so embarrassing. It's true! I came home yesterday and it was so messy! I can't do anything with my leg but guess what he said. He said, "Clean up, Takashi." He's a terrible wife! A wife from hell!' Then I noticed that the shower was broken. There was no shower head. Know what I mean? Did he have shower enemas in my absence? Please! Keeping clean. I can't take a shower! Ouch! See, that's what he does to me. Give me a break! Don't be childish. Don't embarrass me in front of people. Don't be rough! I know. Are you mad at me? You're acting like a kid. No clue? None at all! You made yourself upset. I told you not to do that. You get upset for no reason. Can't you be an adult and control your emotions? No. You can! Don't stop. Wrap it around again. Get it right. Do it properly! That's it. I've had it. I'm leaving you. I can't respect you. You don't make sense. You can leave but fix the shower first. Want a candy? It's peaceful without that fool. Where is he? Not sure, I think they went out for coffee. What did you catch? - Mullet. - Huh? What's that? - Bad tasting fish. - Really? What's your blood type? - B. - Of course... Do you have a nickname? Not really... You're gloomy, Atsushi. Am I? Mom wants you to visit us. Why? Mom and I are close. I mentioned you and she said you could watch TV with her. With your mom? She loves TV. Yes? Can you thank your mom for me? I will. Oh... Hello. I'm not open. No, this is about the money I owe you. Sorry it's not in an envelope. If my friends buy some will I get the friend discount? Forget it. I'm out of stock. Country folk are tricky. They gossip about me because I was in a pageant. I'm not suited to this work. Are you quitting? I know how to flatten them. We collect any type of garbage, free of charge... People who are born special get put down. Like Princess Masako. Masako? Which reminds me... Fujita calls you Princess. Oh... I guess it's from the novel. Novel? I write for a hobby. I've always loved Masako. She's so beautiful. I guess so. I talked about Masako non-stop at my temp job. Like about her rural retreat. They didn't know about that so they wondered if I had royal connections. I haven't even been to college. I told them that my relative worked for the royal family. I got treated better. That's when I noticed... What do you mean? You know, how the world works. Royalty, huh. They used to say I was as useless as a pigeon. That changed. They'd say, "You don't have to do it." I was offered full-time work and they did a background check. They found out I'd lied. Royalty... Royalty. I made some potato salad for you. I forgot to bring the fried chicken. I forgot the main dish! Here are some pickles. Thank you. I've been taking cooking lessons. I'm taking a break now. This is an omelet. I learned how to make formal French dishes but they're not suited to my lifestyle. We pay for the ingredients... Like a lobster this huge. Oh...this too. I'll put it in the fridge. It's okay! I'll do that. I'll just pay my respects. I'm glad you're home. Sorry, I didn't contact you. I tried to call and text you. How're your parents? How are you? Did you marry that guy I met once...? Tulips! See? She loved tulips since she was a kid. She loved things like tulip appliqués. There are many things she loved. Are you OK? There was a man I was going to marry. I loved him very much. He loved me too so we got engaged. He told me that... he loved my funny personality... ...and my funny face. I thought those words would get me through anything. I was so happy. I'd think, I'm really going to marry this man! We were about to marry then Satoko was killed. Then he left me. All my friends left me too. My younger sister was murdered... And my fiancé left me for that. Like I said, we only have mid-range properties like this. Right. It's not suitable for a law firm. I don't know. Starting a law firm isn't easy. It can generate jealousy. Really? May I? Sure. Hello? Hi! Thank you for your business. Uh, the air conditioning? Right, I see. I'll make sure that the landlord knows. Really? Right. I wouldn't worry about it. I see. I'll get back to you by the end of the day. I will. Is there anything else? The mailbox? I'll inform the landlord. He'll attend to it. I'll make sure of it. No problem. Thank you. We'll speak later. Have a nice day. To the station? Take me back! Where to? Hanzomon. Hanzomon... What's up? Huh? Is there anything wrong? Turn left.. I called you at home the other day. Yeah? Your son wanted to see a law firm so... Did he? Yes. So I called but it was strange... With Etsuko. Oh, really... My grandma died recently. Did you hear? Ah, yes. She was good to you when we stayed at her house... I thought I should let you know so I called. And Etsuko just said, "Uh-huh." It was strange. So I told her again that you knew Grandma back in our college days. And she went "Uh-huh" again. She didn't say "Sorry to hear that." Your wife is sometimes like that but this was weird. Oh, really? It's not really about her lack of sympathy... She acted weird! What's going on? Well... Apparently Shota doesn't feel comfortable with you. What? I make Shota uncomfortable? What have I done? He wants to be a lawyer so I offered him a tour. Is that bad? Come on, tell me! Come on! What's it about? It's a father's responsibility to protect his child so... What? Wait. What did you just say? What? What's your dream? Excuse me? I'm going to have one of those. One of those? You know? They lay eggs every day! Oh... All they need is powdered corn. Oh! I'll be my own boss. This is a good business. It's solid. There'll be an auction. I want you to be my partner. You got cash? Cash? How much do you have? For the deposit. Oh... No more processing poultry for me. I'll be in poultry farming. The chicken feed is imported so it's costly. Are there more? Chickens? Yes. All they do is eat and procreate. The idiots. It's beautiful.. Hello. It's been a while. What happened? I fell over at the poolside at the gym. I broke a bone once. Oh, really. Taking baths is hard. It's not so bad. Anyway... Yes. Here's some evidence. I don't know if it helps... My job applications. I didn't have a steady job back then. Satoko's dad said we could marry if I had work. Some of them are kind of funny. We did lots of rewrites. Applications were new to us. I didn't realize that she'd kept them. They took so long to do. I wanted to show them to you. See, everyone makes important decisions in their lives. Aren't you hot? I'm fine. Can you leave that? Oh, of course. Anyway... About the payment. I can't afford 500,000 yen. You said I could pay in installments so I brought 100,000. I thought they reached a verdict. They did. Right. I know nothing can be done about the verdict as he's been tried. But I can make a claim for loss of consortium. A claim? Remember how Kaneko's father visited me and apologized? It meant nothing. What good did it do? On my first visit you suggested I sue for loss of consortium I did? The judge won't like a maneuver like that. Whatever. It's been 6 months. I have to do something. This is what kept me alive. You said May then July as it's 3 years since her death. Now it's October! When are we going to file the lawsuit? Is it money? I'll get it somehow. I'm fit so I'll work my ass off. If you need witnesses or evidence, you'll get them. I'll do absolutely anything I can. I see. Let's call it off. It's already upsetting enough... I'm fine! I can't get any more hurt. No, I find it upsetting. Hello. It didn't work out with the lawyer. I heard. You referred him to me... I barely know him. His name just popped in my head. Just take it to court! So what if you lose? You just have to sue them. I know but... What are you waiting for then? Go for it, boy! You don't even need a lawyer. - That's not a lawsuit. - Just sue them! I want a trial. By the way, I was watching TV and I saw my ex-classmate who's a governor now! He's an idiot! No girls liked him. He'd mess up dates I set up for him. He's against nuclear energy! What a joke! Know what I mean? Idiots like him run the country. Japan's doomed. You'd be better off moving to New Zealand or something. New Zealand? Nice weather! Delicious fish! Great carpaccio restaurants. I looked into it with the idea of retiring there. You've got to make plans! Why not go to New Zealand and ride a motorcycle! You'd forget your worries. I love you like a little brother. I always have. I want you to go for it! That's why I'm saying this. You're back! How did the bid go? - Really? Really? - We got it. Yes! The Olympics, here we come! Keep it down. Did you contact Atsushi? He never answers my calls. Oh. I hope he's OK. Welcome to Japan! I'm home! Mom! Mom, I'm back. Mom, are you home? Mom! Oops, sorry! Hi, Honey! Where were you? I was bringing in the laundry. I wonder if my old friends are still my friends. I couldn't get you an advance. It's not much but... Thank you. Sorry to put you out. It's OK. Let's eat. You can't think on an empty stomach. I'll sue her killer. I want to kill him. Since I can't, I want to make him pay. I talked to 5 lawyers. At 50,000 an hour, they said, "Oh, too bad!" The last lawyer said I could sue him. I met him 6 months later and he said my case upset him so he quit. Then the guy who'd put me on to the lawyer gave me a lecture. Why tell me off? Why not apologize for sending me to an inept lawyer? I wouldn't have complained. He covered his ass by shouting at me. I'm stupid but I can see that much. Why do people do that? They make stupid excuses. The fucking liars! Fuck! Screw carpaccio! Go ahead, eat. I don't think you're stupid. You have a skill. I wish I had your hearing. Look at this body of mine. If I was handsome, people would kiss my ass! There are 3 kinds of idiots. Good, bad and troublesome ones. You're a good idiot. You have a skill so just take your time to get baek on your feet. We won the bid. Really. Otsu is deliriously happy. Sorry but... Honestly I don't give a damn about the Olympics! It won't do this fucked-up country any good. Why don't they make murder legal? Like in the days when samurai freely killed people. Some people deserve to die. I might be condemned but God would forgive me. I'd be killing a person who deserves it. She was just walking. Then she was stabbed and died on the spot. She had her cell phone out and it was flipped open. Maybe... She was trying to call me for help. I really want to kill him. If you hit a person's nose like this, he dies in 30 seconds. The nasal bone goes in the brain. Dead in 30 seconds. A knock! Like this! Knock! Knock! You can't kill him. If you killed him, we couldn't talk like this. I'd hate that. You know, I... I want to speak with you more. Ouch! "Get well soon, Satoshi" Is it okay? Looks okay. It's done. Thank you. Is it better? How does it feel? Well.. I can't really tell. It's scary at first. Take care. We had fried chicken and fried rice... And drank too much. Yes. Sorry but I have to piss. Can't I? Well, OK. You sure? OK, I'll take a piss. On one condition. Can I watch? OK. Here I go. Go on. What? What? What? What is it? Don't splash me! Cut it out! What? I just wanted to watch! Here it is. Can I open it? No you can't. You said I could in the mail. You could run without paying. I want to check it. It's cool. It's good stuff. You want to try it? Now? It won't hurt. No thank you. I won't leave a mark. Got a syringe? No! You'll love it. "Don't shoot it up. You'd die! It's calcium hypochlorite." It's for goldfish...? Oh God! Oh God! Do it! Come on, do it! I can't... No! Good evening. Hello? Are you home? Did I ask you over? It's nothing. I'll finish it up. I'm not done. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK, I'm tough. I'm tough. But.. Oh, shit! It won't stay on. Where's the camera? Ouch, it hurts! He's hit rock bottom. Did he take you to see the chickens? He lied about that. Wait...! Take these off. Off. Wait a minute.. These are perfect. These are good. You know.. I had a part-time job which I wasn't good at. When the boss went on a business trip I often messed up by booking the wrong train. He called me to complain. "I'm at Shinagawa station, watching my train go past." I thought the express trains stopped there. He yelled, Not the one you booked for me! My boss started giving me this lecture. According to him there were 2 ways to approach work. One of those ways is that you use your skills to benefit the company. He said that's like a chicken laying eggs. Another way is to dedicate yourself to the job. You devote yourself to the company completely. Just like pigs sacrificing themselves. Pigs die and offer their own flesh. And the boss said, "I want the latter." It made no sense but I said, "OK." Later he told me that it was his pickup line. Now I'm married to him. The other day... you asked me about my dreams. I've been thinking about it. About my dream... Hello? Hello. It's me, Takashi. Got a minute? About the other day... Hey, stop playing with your food, son! Hello? Can I call you back? I just want to talk about our conversation the other day. You there? Yeah. You made it sound like I mistreated your boy. I don't know for sure. Yes, you do! But I can't ask the boy, can I? What? Who told you then? Your wife? Well, you know... I didn't do anything wrong! Can I talk to her? Just leave it. Why's this happening? I wouldn't touch a kid! I'll tell her. You'll tell her! How about you? Do you believe her? Son, what are you up to? Look I'm busy, I better go. Bye. You know... I've always loved you. I've loved you since we were at college. I never told you that. I wouldn't offend you. When I told you I was gay you told me that you didn't mind. We remained friends after you got married. I wouldn't hurt a child. All the time we spent together, all the nights out... All the trips and all the fun we had together... What was that for...? I went to Ueno. There was a couple. The man started pissing in the street. And they seemed so happy. They looked kind of stupid. Watching them, I thought... They're in love. That's how it seemed. Just like you and I were. It was beautiful. I'm an idiot. I'm not a good communicator. I never thought I'd find a girlfriend. Getting married seemed so unlikely. Then you came along, Satoko. You told me you'd stay with me. That was the happiest moment in my life. It made me glad that I'd been born. I promised to kill your murderer. But I can't. I'm so stupid... I can't kill him. I can't even kill myself. Nothing matters any more. I bought calcium hypochlorite thinking it was speed. I can't do anything right. Since you died, Satoko I can't do anything right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. "For Rent" What's this? Scallops. How about tea? Scallops? Here. Try this. The scallops are good. I guess we are out. I'll go get some. Don't worry. But I'll get pregnant. It's OK. We're married. OK. Is it ready? This one's ready. That one's OK. That one's ready! Thank you! Here. It's so yummy! Eating enough? This is yours. I'm OK. The chef gets no time to eat! Can I ask what happened to your arm? This? I was making a rocket. A rocket? I was a left-wing activist. I got talked into joining. A rocket? To blow up the palace. Blow up the Emperor's palace? Right. It was cheaply made. It blew up my arm instead of the palace. Laughing is good. Life's OK when you eat well and laugh. Oh, give me a break! How about the girl? You'd decided she was the one. I had. Not anymore. You're so obnoxious! Hey! I know you were rooting for me... No way! I did my best but...I give up. Being apart from him... I realized how much he meant to me. No one's perfect, right? Marriage is about getting over obstacles. Oh, my God! I made you cry? Now I want to cry too. Uh, well... I'm so happy you understand me. I feel good. I've decided. The divorce... We love each other. Very well. I'm happy for you. Gateball? There's a match today and we'll win! Go for it. Time for the news. A couple was arrested for staging a sham royal wedding. The suspects are Minoru Tanaka and Harumi Yoshida. Pretending to be royalty they held a wedding reception. 400 guests gave them gifts valued at 17 million yen in total. Tanaka says he didn't intentionally deceive the guests.
