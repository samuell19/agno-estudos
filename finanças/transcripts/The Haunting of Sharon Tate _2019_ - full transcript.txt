Subtitles by explosiveskull [ominous music plays] [Sharon] I think my whole life has been decided by fate. [movie projector whirring] [reporter] Have you ever had what some might term a psychic experience? Yes, in fact, I have. I guess that's what it was, anyway. I guess you could call it a nightmare. It was a terribly frightening and disturbing thing for me. My husband Roman and I had recently rented this beautiful home up in the hills of Hollywood. It's been around for quite some time and many famous people have lived there before us. Lillian Gish, and Cary Grant, and most recently the record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend Candice Bergen who are friends of ours. Anyway, it was about a week or so after we moved in and I was awoken by something in the middle of the night. So, I turned on the light, and that's when I saw this strange man just standing in the door frame of our bedroom. So, I got out of bed. And I followed him down into the living room. And that's when I saw two people had been tied to the rafters in the ceiling. And as I moved closer, I realized it was my friend Jay Sebring and me, and both of us had been cut open at the throat. [sighs] [ominous music plays] [reporter] In a scene described by one investigator as reminiscent of a weird religious rite, five persons, including actress Sharon Tate were found dead at the home of Ms. Tate and her husband, screen director Roman Polanski. Ms. Tate, who starred in Valley of the Dolls was eight months pregnant and was found in a bikini type nightgown with a rope around her neck attached to the body of a man. When police arrived, they found the telephones and electricity lines cut. The bodies had been dead about 12 hours. We drove to the house, uh, with instructions... to kill everyone in the house. - [detective] From Charlie? - Yeah. [female reporter] Manson led a cult of young rebellious runaways, who followed his every instruction. It was like I was caught in something that I had no control over. I had absolutely no say so as to what was happening now. I was just like a tool in the hands of the devil, is the only way I can put it. [male reporter] One officer summed up the murders when he said, "In all my years, I have never seen anything like this before." My love house. I started to feel like I might never see it again. Did you know that "cielo" means "heaven" in Spanish? Well, your heavenly hideaway hasn't changed much in six months. Not that I can say the same for you. Are you gonna give me a hand or just let me roast to death in this car? Hey, these hands are my livelihood. Besides, I don't know if I'm strong enough - to lift you up. - You creep! - Take it back right now. - Never! - Come on, one, two, and we go. - [grunts] Phew! - You okay? - Starting to get used to this. You're an old pro. You think it's possible to fall in love at first sight twice? You're the one who left me for another man, remember? Well, you didn't become a stylist to the stars by just running your fingers through their hair. What can I say? I like to keep my clients happy. [laughing] [footsteps] Hello? Is anyone home? - [barking] - [both] Surprise. What on Earth? Doctor Saperstein, come here, boy. Come here. Oh, I missed you. [chuckles] - Welcome home. - [Sharon] Hi, Gib. Oh, my goodness, I can't believe it. Shar, you look like you're about to burst. That's about how I feel right now. Welcome home, doll. You shouldn't be on your feet. Our beautiful Sharon. And where's that rat bastard husband of yours, hmm, hmm? [Sharon] Oh, oh. Oh, it's good to see you too, Wojciech. You do remember she's married to your best friend, right? Don't be jealous, baby, you know I'm all yours. - [laughing] - [both] Surprise. - [Jay] Thanks a lot. - We thought you were Roman. - Oh, Roman is not here. - [Gibby] What do you mean? He decided to stay in London to finish the script for a few weeks, but he promised he's going to be home before the baby arrives. Yeah, well, he better be. Holy shit, close your eyes, I have a surprise for you. [chuckles] [giggling] - [Sharon] What's this all about? - Okay, okay, get ready. - Surprise. - [gasps] Oh, my goodness. Oh. Gib. Don't you just love it? [Sharon] Yes. It's just... Well, you know, I planned to work on the nursery myself while I waited for Roman - to come home. - But now you don't have to. Look, I took care of everything for you. [chuckles] [chuckles] So is that really his excuse? It's an important project for him, Gib. He's got a lot riding on this one. Yes. Well, I can see how a film called Day of the Dolphin would be more important than coming home and spending time with your eight months pregnant wife. Gibby. You know, it is just like a man to take his priorities and shove them sideways up his ass. Gib, I'm fine. We're fine. Well, my lovely, you can forget about any kind of personal privacy now. You've got your two loyal house sitters staying on to look after you, not to mention your adoring public, all of whom eagerly await the return of the star of The Twelve Chairs. - Of The Thirteen Chairs. - What? Yeah, the studio decided to change the title. I think they figured twelve chairs wasn't enough once they saw the size of my ever-expanding ass. That is nonsense. The extra chair is for Orson Welles. Have you seen the size of his ass lately? Well, here's to Orson Welles. And to Sharon Tate Polanski and her once spectacular ass. May it find its way home soon. Please. [indistinct chatter, laughing] So the next time I meet him, I'm trying to get into this school dance, but, guarding the entrance, there's a strange little guy. Now to me he looks like an elf, one of those, um... The lawns that you, uh... - A gnome? - A gnome, yes, thank you. - [laughing] - And this little gnome, he refuses to let me into the dance because the teacher says I have a reputation - for making trouble. - Mm. So I tell him, in my most intimidating voice, "You want to see how much trouble I can make? You just keep standing in my way." And then he gets right up to my face and says, - "Well, give it your best shot." - [all laughing] A week later, I buy him drinks, and I give him money to make his first film. This is how I meet Roman Polanski. - The end. - [Jay] Yes. [applause] - Earth to Sharon. - [gasps] - You okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. What is going on inside that pretty little head of yours? Well, I... I guess it was what you were just saying. Like, how the simplest of choices can affect the entire outcome of our lives. Wojciech, what if you had never had that run in with Roman at your school dance? And what if I had never wandered onto that movie set when I was 17? I mean, I had always dreamed of being an actress, but what if I hadn't have been at that exact place, on that exact day? Do you know what I mean? Like, is life just some... random series of coincidences, or is there some greater plan? Some higher purpose for all of us? Don't you ever think about how our smallest decisions can somehow change the course of everything? Honey, with your talent and those God-given looks, you were destined to be a star. Me? Well, I'll forever be known as Abigail Folder, queen of your morning cup of coffee. - Gib. - Look, your career, you and Roman, and that beautiful baby you are about to bring into the world, it was all meant to be. We can all look back at the choices we've made, the roads taken and not taken, and wonder if this is all life has in store for us. But, as for you, Sharon Tate, well, I think life is working out exactly how it's supposed to. [crickets chirping] You okay? I think he's having another affair. - What makes you say that? - Because I just know. Do you know how our arrangement works? Roman lies to me, and I pretend to believe him. It doesn't have to be like this, Sharon. - You always have a choice. - He's my husband. We're about to have our first child. We'll figure it out somehow. Come back inside, you guys, you have got to see this. I found it in the attic a couple days ago, I'll go first. - This is so silly. - Oooh. Will Sharon have a beautiful baby girl? - [Wojciech] Oh. - [giggling] I knew it, - I knew you were having a boy. - Okay, I love you, but you are ridiculous. Okay. Okay, come on, it's your turn. [sigh] Okay, um... Hmm. Will I live a long, happy life? [footsteps] [whining] - [knocking at door] - [dog barking] Who is that? - I got it. [grunts] - [barking continues] I'm coming, I'm coming. Be quiet, Doctor Saperstein. What do you want? [man speaks indistinctly] [Wojciech] Sorry, man, I've told you before, you've got the wrong house. Like I keep telling you. [man speaks indistinctly] [Wojciech] Terry doesn't live here anymore. This is the home of Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate. [Charlie] If you see him, can you let him know I need to talk to him? Just really quick. Yeah, cool, man, peace. Thanks, brother. [barking continues] [ominous music plays] - Who is that? - Just some odd ball who keeps coming around looking for Terry Melcher. Did he tell you his name? Uh... I don't remember. Charlie. Charlie something, I think. [exhales] Damn you, Roman. [squeaking] [moaning] Seriously, you guys? [moaning] [buttons clicking] [rustling] - [door creaking] - [gasps] [crickets chirping] [grunts] [door locking] [rustling] [dog whining] [Sharon] Hey. [clicks tongue] What's going on, boy? - Hey. Did you hear something? - [rustling] [door closes] [rustling] [sighs] - [knocking at door] - [dog barking] [Wojciech] Who the hell is it at this hour? [dog barking] - Who was that? - Stay back. You got some nerve. Doctor Saperstein. - No, don't! - [barking continues] Doctor Saperstein. [whistling] [door locking] What is that? That's... The weirdo must have left it earlier. I want to get that gate checked in the morning, okay? No one should be allowed on this property - without the code. - Of course. Yeah, we'll get it changed. Don't, don't worry, Sharon, we're here to take care of you, all right? [sighs] [clicking] [insects buzzing] Do you think we're the only ones here? It's like the entire world is still asleep. I say enjoy it while you can. Everything has been so quiet since I got back. I thought the phone would be ringing off the hook. I guess it's true what they say: "Out of sight, out of mind." Doctor's orders, remember? He doesn't want you under any stress until that baby arrives, so I put the word out. No calls unless it's an absolute emergency. [scoffs] Well, thanks for that, but I'm not exactly an invalid. So, how are things going with you and Wojciech? Yeah, I didn't want to say anything yesterday, but, look, after what happened last night, I just thought you should know. Know what? [sighs] I've just been a little concerned about some of the types he's had over at the house while you've been away. - What do you mean? - It's just... [sighs] Woj's new friends, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with them, and you know me, I'm all about 'do whatever and be whatever'. But some of these cats are... What? They're just strange, I don't know how else to explain it. They've been making the rounds with their stuff. Brian, Nancy, Cass, that whole scene. - Mm. - Well, they're all using it. And you know a little experimentation is one thing, but the dope these guys are selling... it's pretty extreme. You know Roman and I are all about guests. I mean, our home is an open space for our friends and that's how we like it. But, I don't like the idea of some underworld... [ominous music playing] Maybe we should head back. Relax, it's fine. I'm just... I'm feeling a little bit tired. Well, come on, I know a shortcut. Okay. - You still with me, Shar? - Yep. - Can you make it? - I'm coming. [insects buzzing] No. Oh, no. No! It's my fault. I should have gone after him last night. No. Sharon, there is no way any of us could have possibly known this would happen. He stays outside at night all the time. We found a nice spot for him in the garden. I'm very sorry for your loss, Ms. Tate. I'm sorry, who are you? My name is Steven, ma'am, Steven Parent. I've been staying out in the trailer for the past few weeks. I thought Will lived in the trailer. Will hasn't been around for a while. He and Steven are friends, so he's been filling in to help keep things nice for you and Roman. That's odd, no one mentioned that to me. I'm sorry, ma'am, if you want me to go, I'll completely understand. No, you're welcome to stay. It's... I just hadn't been made aware there was a new caretaker, that's all. Well, I'll be out back working on my car if you need anything. Um... I'm really pleased to finally meet you, ma'am, I really enjoyed your work in Valley of the Dolls. He's a really good kid, Shar. And he's a hard worker. - I must've forgotten to mention. - Is there anything else I should be made aware of? Any other changes you took it upon yourselves to make while Roman and I were away? I know you're upset, Sharon. I'm the one to blame here. I should have brought the dog inside. Maybe you should have. [crying] [wood creaking] [door creaking] Hello?

Come on. [Sharon groaning] Oh, I just really, really hope he didn't suffer out there... all alone. [Jay] Sometimes bad things just happen. You can't protect everything, or everyone. [Sharon sighs] I just... I wish Roman were here. This is supposed to be our home. Roman, me, the baby. Yet, I just feel like a stranger here. It's like they've just taken over. And I appreciate what they're doing, - but it's all... - A little much. That's being nice. They are constantly in my business, making decisions for me, acting like they own my house. Roman is going to be home soon, and then... you can kiss the squatters from Hell goodbye. [Wojciech] So, I was thinking, maybe later... Do you think that we are slaves to our own destiny? This again. I mean... do you think it's possible to alter the course of our fate, or is our story just our book... written before we were even born? I like to think that anything is possible. You know, I think there's infinite choices, infinite realities. We might be living out different versions of our own story for who knows? Probably forever. At least, until we get it right. I guess in movie speak, it means we can... re-write our own scripts. And I think no matter which road we choose, we always arrive at the same place. What's this all about? I don't know... just my maternal instincts kicking in, I guess. Get some rest, beautiful. That goes for both of you. No serious thoughts tonight. I'll be at the bottom of the canyon if you need me. And you know I can run these stairs in record time. - My hero. - Don't forget, we have dinner at El Coyote tomorrow night. I know. [Wojciech] Smile. What a gorgeous couple.

It's okay. - [inaudible] - You're okay. [Sharon] It was just like that terrible dream I had. They were killing all of us. And my baby. [sobbing] [Gibby] It's okay, you're okay. [crying] - Did you call Roman? - Twice. Still no answer. What are we going to do? I don't know. - [door opens] - I just... Morning, hon. How are you feeling? Shar, are you okay? - What is that? - What is what? That, that, that dead thing in my refrigerator. - What dead thing? - Right there, the dead animal. - Shar, I don't know what you'... - It's right the... It was just... right there. Honey, I think you're just overheated, okay? No! No, no, no, I just saw it, it was right there. Are you two telling me I'm seeing things that aren't there? [scoffs] Do you think I've gone mad? Not at all, sweetie. Look, it is perfectly normal for someone - in your condition to... - Stop patronizing me. Ever since I got home, all you two have done is tell me, "Stop worrying, everything is fine, nothing is wrong." But something is wrong. Something is, is very wrong inside this house, and I can't explain it. Someone tell me about this man. I want you to tell me everything you know about this, this Charlie. Sweetie, you had a nightmare. It was a terrible one, but that's all it was. I can't begin to imagine the things that are going on inside your body right now. The chemical changes, and the emotional stress. Hell, I would be scared shitless if I was about to have my first baby. Also remember, you're the one who's always telling me the things we manifest in life come from the things that we put energy into. [gasps] I don't know what's going on here and I don't know how you two are involved. But you have done nothing but turn this house upside down and allow God knows who on our property. Now someone tell me who the hell this Charlie is, because I am not staying here any longer, not for one more goddamn day. We don't know the guy, Sharon, okay? I promise you. He came by here a couple times while you were away. I think some of the girls in his family... That's what he calls them... They were at a couple of parties we had. But he is somehow convinced Terry Melcher still lives here and promised him some kind of bogus record deal. I swear to you, that's all we know. Well, whoever he is, and whoever this family of his is, they are trying to kill me. And they're trying to kill the baby, and I'm not going to let that happen. Sharon, do you hear what you're saying? You're sounding as if you think there's some - kind of plot against you. - This is not one - of Roman's movies. - Don't tell me that I am making this up, that it is some figment of my imagination, okay? This, this, this recording that this guy left, it switched on last night by itself, okay? They were in this house. There was a man, and there was two women, and they had a gun and knives, and they came here to kill us all. Sharon, stop it. I understand that you're under a tremendous strain and that you're upset Roman is not here, but, God, this is just starting to sound like you're... Crazy? I'll show you crazy. Sharon, we didn't want you to worry. So you thought you would hide them from me? How, how many times has this creep been to my house? - How many times? - I don't know. Look, we find them at odd times, in different places. And did you ever think to call the police? And tell them what, that we're getting mail for a previous tenant? This person, these, these people, they're a threat to my safety and to the safety of my baby. Do you honestly think we would ever let anything happen to you or the baby? Sharon, we are staying here to make sure you're safe until Roman gets back. Safe from what? [sighs] At this point, Sharon, safe from yourself. [scoffs] We're done here.

Oh, oh, please just call me Sharon. Sharon. [chuckles] Oh, I meant to tell you I changed the code on the gate this morning, just to be on the safe side. Thank you, Steven. They were right, you're a handy guy to have around. Ah. Do you think you might be able to help me figure out one more thing? [Steven] Right this way. [clears throat] - [Sharon] Oh. Watch your head. - Okay. [Steven] Oh. Sorry. Sorry. [clears throat] Thank you. [Steven clears throat] Huh, you're really into gadgets, aren't you? I've always loved taking things apart and putting them back together. I guess I enjoy figuring out how stuff works. Keep it up and you may become a world famous inventor one day. - What, me? - Yeah. Nah. I'm just a kid from El Monte who works part time in a stereo store to save up enough money for college. And I'm just a girl from Dallas who's... military dad moved the family every few years and never had any friends. Yeah, but look what you became, a world famous movie star. [chuckles] Hardly world famous. Well, you are to me. [clears throat] What about you, Steven? Do you have someone? Special in your life? Not really. I don't see much of anyone lately. I left home sort of suddenly and... well, I don't... talk to my family these days. You know, it's never too late to tell the people you care about how you feel. I'd like to visit them before I move on. Even just once. To say goodbye. You should do that. So, this is the tape you say started up by itself in the middle of the night? I honestly can't explain it. I know I sound completely crazy. Well, things always seem crazy if you don't ask questions.

It's intended to be subliminal, audible only on an unconscious level. It's mostly used in advertising to convince people to buy things that they don't need. It's used all over the media... radio, TV, movies, music... to spread messages. What kind of messages? I guess all kinds. Even Satanic messages. [sighs] [Sharon] Satanic. Personally, I think it's all part of a plot, created by the government to turn us all into conformists, to keep us from questioning what's really going on with the man, From thinking for ourselves. Think about it, if they keep us in the dark, they control everything. We become a society of mindless consumerist robots left to roam the wastelands of their artificially-constructed purgatory.

Please don't kill her, please don't kill her. Well, I guess we'll start with you then, pretty boy.

[groans] [screaming] [indistinct yelling] [grunting and groaning] [screaming] Jay, look out! [Gibby grunts] Come on. Come on. [Steven] Come in. Steven, Will had a ham radio. Maybe he left it in here somewhere. - I can put it back together. - [Sharon] Okay. [clock ticking] [door creaks opens] [groaning] [grunts] [groaning, indistinct voices] [grunting] [panting] [groaning] [Gibby] Where is Wojciech? [Steven] Hurry up, more of them might be coming.

You are not going to die, you are not going to die. [man over radio] Hello? Hello? Come in. - [panting] - [muffled radio static] [man over radio] Ten-38, ambulance remotely needed. Awaiting confirmation on caller's 20. Ten-nine, you were stepped off, repeat the message, come back. Anyone there? Come in. Twenty four-nine for a radio check. I can't help you if you don't answer. Do you need an ambulance? Hello? Come in. Break one-nine for a radio check. Ten-38, ambulance remotely needed. Awaiting confirmation on caller's 20. Ten-nine, you were stepped on, repeat the message, come back. Anyone there? Come in. Break one-nine for a radio check. [Steven] Hey, asshole. [groaning] [Steven panting] [gun cocking] Fuck you! [whimpering] - [Gibby] Sharon. - [Jay] Sharon. [panting] Wojciech! [all panting] Here we go. Come on. [Sharon] Do you think it's possible to alter the course of our fate, or is our story just our book, written before we were even born? [Jay] I think there's infinite choices, infinite realities. We're probably living out different versions of our own story for... who knows? Probably forever, at least until we get it right. [Sharon] I would like to be a fairy princess. A little golden doll with gossamer wings, in a voile dress, adorned with bright, shiny things. I see that as something totally pure and beautiful. I think my whole life has been decided by fate. I've never planned anything that's ever happened to me. I guess you could say I live in a fairytale world, looking at everything through rose-colored glasses. I probably always will.
