[gibberish] Hey, you're smurfing the wrong way. Geronimo! Uh-oh. Whoo! [grunts] Bouillabaisse! Ze Santa snowman, she is ruined! [Baby crying] Oh, I should never have let you tamper with my tinsel. [gibberish] Are you here to help us decorate for Christmas? [gibberish] [bell ringing] (Brainy) Forget it, Nat. This is one Smurf who doesn't know a bell from a bonnet. [bell ringing] Oh, Wild. Are you here to help trim the tree? [gibberish] crash Oh, my. That's not the kind of trimming I meant. (Vanity) Papa Smurf, this savage smurf has dismantled my decorations. Not to mention my tinsel. Easy, my little Smurfs. You can't expect Wild to know what to do at Christmas because this is Wild's first Christmas. [gibberish] [laughing] Oh, Christmas is so much fun, Wild. There's singing, dancing, and lots of presents. Right, Jokey? Yeah, lots of big surprises. [laughing] [gibberish] That's holiday ribbon, Wild. It's for wrapping things. Oh! [blabbering] (Brainy) Hey! [grunting] I meant wrapping gifts, not Smurfs. Sorry. [Brainy screaming] (Greedy) Christmas means lots of smurfy decorations. And some you can eat. [eating noisily] Like my smurfberry candy canes. (Clumsy) Gosh! Let me have some, Greedy. Oops. crash [Smurfs cheering] Nice job, Clumsy. (Smurfette) 'So, you see, Wild. Christmas is so Smurfy.' It certainly is, my little Smurfs. There's a special spirit of giving and sharing for everyone. Not just Smurfs. Gosh! Where are you going, Papa Smurf? To deliver this gift to Enchanter Homnibus. When I return, we can all exchange gifts. Why can't we do that now? Because grandpa and Sassette aren't back yet. Smurfaroo! Where did they go? Grandpa decided to give Sassette her present a little early. [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] (man) Fresh fish! Cook a trout for Christmas eve. A necklace for your wife, milord. Buy your apples here. Gray bug grunion, Grampy! Thanks for showing me what Christmas eve is like for humans. Smurfatoodie. It was nothing. Care for an apple? Oh, I'm too excited to eat, Grampy. Just look at all these humans and those smurfy toys. Jumping jacks for sale. Buy one for your children. They make wonderful gifts. Jumping jackrabbits, Grampy. Can we take a closer look? Ha ha ha ha. Alright, Sassette. But be careful these humans don't see us. (thief) Ha, ha. Christmas! My favorite time of year. When everyone's purse is full of gold. 'Ah-ha! There's a fat Christmas goose' 'just waiting to be plucked.' Time to make my move. Huh! Smurfatoodie! That was close. Sneaky sandworms, Grampy, look. 'Why is that human taking the other one's bag?' I'm afraid not every human is as smurfy as they should be, Sassette. My money! It's gone! Flying foxes! That sneaky human is getting away. Mmm! It's a long shot, Sassette. whoosh Yow! [coins clinking] My money! Stop! Thief! [crowd clamoring] Grampy, you did it. Smurfaroony, nothin' to it. But I wasted a pretty tasty apple. Oh, alas! No one seems interested my little jack. 'And we are need at home.' Sir, please wait. I...I've been admiring your toys. Don't be shy, boy, come closer. So you really like my funny little puppets? Oh, yes, sir. Oh, yes. I'm sure you give Jack a good home. Ha ha. Merry Christmas. For me? (father) 'Hans!' Keep away from there. But...but father! How many times have I told you these poor people are not our kind. They live in those hovels across the river. 'You live in a fine home.' So keep away from them. Really, Willum. Must you be so. (father) 'And what is this?' The nice man gave it to-- Hans, I will buy you fancier toys than this. Now, get in the carriage. [horse neighing] But, Grampy. I don't understand? I know, Sassette. Sometimes, the way humans behave toward each other even puzzles me. Leaving so soon, Gustav? Alas! My wife is not well, and I must not miss the doctor. Sad-eyed sparrows, Grampy! Why does that nice old man look so unhappy? I'm not sure, Sassette, but-- Well, let's go find out. [instrumental music] (doctor) I've done all I can, Gustav, but her spirit is very weak. Is there nothing I can do, doctor? (doctor) 'Perhaps the Christmas holiday will brighten her mood.' Otherwise, I'm afraid.. Thank you for coming, doctor. (Gustav)'Und merry Christmas.' Here, Elise. I made this for you. 'Merry Christmas.' A jumping Jill. Oh, it's beautiful, Gustav. It reminds me of Christmas long ago. Children's laughter. People singing. 'I hung a Christmas star on the tree.' (Gustav) 'And we made Christmas wishes on it?' They don't come true anymore. They can, Elise. Rember those stories about Christmas elves. It's going to take more than fairy tales to make this a merry Christmas. Let me rest now, Gustav. Oh! If only I could make a Christmas eve bright enough to cheer her up. 'To bring that rosy glow back to her cheeks.' Helpless hounddogs, Grampy. Isn't there something we can do to make their Christmas eve smurfier? Smurfatoodie! Maybe we can. Come on, Sassette. I thought I heard something, Elise. Huh, like Christmas elves? [wind gusting] Ah, no. Just my old eyes playing tricks on me. [excited chatter] [peppy music] Oh, Wild. You're standing underneath a mistletoe. Muah. [blabbering] Happy homing pigeons, Grampy, we're back! If we're gonna give those humans a smurfy Christmas we'll need some help. I'll go get the Smurflings. Silent songbirds, hold it, guys. There's a sick old woman who really needs our-- Can't you see we're practicing. Yeah, you big hickory nut. We want our Christmas song to sound smurfsational. [slurps] [clears throat] Greedy! There are two lonely old humans who could use some help. Phew! I'm a little short-handed myself. Love to chat, Grandpa. Maybe after dinner. There's Smurfette. She'll help. Smurfette! You've got to listen. This poor old woman is really sick and-- Oh! I'm so sorry, Sassette. Smurfaroo! I knew you'd understand. 'Yes, I'm so sorry. I can't talk now.' I-I just have to finish hanging these Christmas wreaths. Oh! Hectic hummingbirds, Grampy! Every Smurf's too busy to listen. Gloomy glowworms, Grampy. No Smurf heard a word we said. [howling] [gibberish] Well, almost no smurf. Yes, the others seem a might busy with their own Christmas chores. And by the time they have time to listen Christmas eve will be over. And that poor old woman might be.. Smurfaroony! Then I reckon it's time to take matters into our own hands, Sassette. I hope those humans like the gifts we picked out for them. 'I'm sure they will, Sassette.' But it's gonna be a might difficult carrying them. (Wild) 'Smurfs! Smurfs!' [gibberish] Smurfaloo! Looks like Wild is one step or should I say sled, ahead of us. Scamperin' squirrels, let's get smurfin'. Oh! You're back just in time, Papa Smurf. Christmas eve dinner is ready. [licks lips] [gulps] And it tastes just smurfy. Oh, Papa Smurf! Now, can we exchange presents? I don't see why not, Brainy. Here's one from Enchanter Homnibus for Grandpa Smurf. Uh, by the way where is Grandpa Smurf and Sassette? Aren't they back from town yet? [eating noisily] Oh, they're back alright. They keep talking about some old humans that need our help. [gulps] I was too busy to listen. Oh, they've gone off to the human village with Wild Smurf. Huh! Can you imagine, Papa Smurf leaving a perfectly smurfing Christmas eve party to go see some old humans. Yes, I can imagine it, Brainy. Especially when they are sick, needy people who can't help themselves. But it looks like all of you were so wrapped up in your own holiday you ignored the problems of those less fortunate. Oh, Papa Smurf, I feel terrible. Couldn't we help Grandpa Smurf and Sassette too. Well.. We could give those humans some of our decorations for their tree. But Sassette said, they don't even have one. We could share ours. Give me a hand, Hefty. That's the Christmas spirit, my little Smurfs. Oh, but how will we get everything to the old couple's house. [Puppy barking] Hop on, Smurfette. This is absosmurfly ridiculous. I mean, it's.. Hey! [Brainy panting] Wait for.. ...me! See, Brainy, no one wants to spend 'Christmas eve all alone.' [Sassette shivering] Grampy, are we going to make it? I don't know, Sassette. I don't know. (Brainy) Please, Papa Smurf, turn around. We'll never get to those humans. We keep going until we find Grandpa and the others. [bell ringing] Smurfy idea, Baby. [bell ringing] Grampy, I think I hear Santy. [Puppy barking] Not unless he's got barking reindeer. thud Pappy Smurf. Thought you might need a little company this Christmas eve. Yes, Papa Smurf and I decided to bring a little holiday spirit to those needy humans. [kisses] Yuck! That's enough holiday spirit out of you. Yah, Puppy! Ya! Smurf it all you've got. (Elise) 'Put out the fire and come to bed, Gustav.' Christmas eve is over. Yeah, Elise. And tomorrow you'll be stronger. I...I hope. [instrumental music] Ah! What a fine Christmas eve night for purse-snatching. [cackles] Rich folks hurrying home with presents too busy to guard their gold. [Wild speaking gibberish] Yes, Wild. It's a human town. And we have to smurf right through it to get where we're going. We better stick to the alleys to avoid being seen. These gifts will surprise Hans. Brr! I think I'll take this shortcut home. [dramatic music] My gold! Stop, thief! 'Thief!' Hang on, every Smurf. Ah! bam Tumblin' termites, that was close, Grampy. Help! Help! Get the sheriff! Oh! I knew we never should have left the village. Brainy! There he goes. (Brainy) 'Papa Smurf?' (Hefty) 'No! The thief.' Come on, we can catch him. Catch him. But we've gotta catch up with the sled. That sneaky thief went this way. Oh, I should be home opening presents not chasing some unsmurfy human through a dark.. [screaming] [growling] Hefty! Help! [growling] Hang on, Brainy, I'm coming. (Hefty) 'Jump, Brainy.' Whoa! Smurf for your life! bam (Sassette) 'Weary warblers, we're too late, Pappy Smurf.' 'They've gone to bed.' Then we will just leave a little surprise for them on Christmas morning. [instrumental music] Smurf! [gibberish] Yes, Wild. You sure know how to string tinsel. Mwah 'Mistletoe.' (Hefty) 'There he goes.' Soon, I'll be home free. [coins clinking] We got him cornered now, Brainy. Come on! Beautiful job, my little Smurfs. Now, let's hurry home before anyone catches us. Gosh! Isn't that smurf scene grandy.. Oops! [crashing] [glass shatters] (Gustav) 'Elise! What was that?' (Elise) 'Just the wind.' Ah! Elves. 'Elise! Elves!' Gustav, you're dreaming. Believe me. Oh! Elves! [laughing] We're not elves. We're Smu-- Well, I guess you could call us elves. Yes. Christmas elves. A Christmas star! - You did this for us. - For you. To make you well again. I-I can't believe it.

[knocking on door] Now, who could that be at this.. Why, sheriff! Just look at those decorations, sheriff. He could never afford them without stealing. He didn't steal anything. The elves decorated our hut. [coughing] Elise, you should be back in bed. Oh, Grampy, this is terrible. Poor Elise is getting upset. Yeah, Sassette. All the good we've done is being undone. Elves! Arrest this old thief, sheriff. I'm afraid you'll have to come with us. And I'm afraid we'll have to show ourselves to save our human friends. He didn't steal your gold. I snatched your purse in the alley. (sheriff) 'But why are you confessing?' I'm gonna start giving instead of taking. Thanks to Christmas spirit. Well, what do you know, Brainy? He listened to what we were saying. Huh, if everyone listened to the brilliant words of Brainy Smurf, the world would be a smurfier place. Hey! Missing mackerels, where have you two been? Just spreading a little of your Christmas spirit, Sassette. Here, let me help you back into bed. But what about him? Are you pressing charges? No. I've gotten my gold back. And after all, it is Christmas eve. Your house looks so lovely. Thanks to those elves. Oh! You must meet them. They're hiding under my bed. Oh! They're gone. Oh, Grandpa, Elise sounds much better. Smurfatoodies, I have a feeling she'll be alright now. [indistinct chatter] [chuckles] Looks like Wild Smurf will never forget his first Christmas. And I haven't forgotten all of you. I just happen to have a few dozen Yuletide Quotations left. (all) Oh! (Brainy) Alright. Alright. Maybe next Christmas. [theme music]
