Ah, sorry for intruding on your work No... I'll eat it if you put it down Ah, it's OK. I'm really sorry Sorry! I wanted to receive something special from Takashi Something that's...just for me Hey Did you pass the ?? bridge today? Ah, I did Did you go with a woman? Yup, a co-worker I see Why? Are you mad? No, I'm not You are angry No I'm not. Why would I get mad? Then that's good I hope you're (Takashi) not only listening to the surface meanings of my words I hope you will understand my heart But then again, I'm just thinking to myself again In the end, perhaps I don't want to hurt myself Because of that thought, Takashi & I didn't contact for a long time However, I suddenly saw him on the way home from school Takashi told me that legends say that this river had a 7-color carp If you saw that carp, your wishes will come true This is my first time hearing this story Did that girl come to school? Not yet I see Then...if you see the 7-color carp, make a wish for her to come to school Takashi didn't say anything about last time But I feel happy with what he said already I like you (Takashi) That's enough, right? Ishitobi-san? Ishitobi-san! Do you know the legend about this river having a 7-color carp? Eh, there's a legend like that? Yup. I heard it from lovers' stories Ah... There isn't a carp, right? Ah... Are you leaving? Yeah Do you want a ride? OK! Kae-chan, do you come by this river often? Yup, it's close to my school Ah, I see Do you also pass by here often? Yes, often Then, we might've passed each other here often Hmm, you're right It's so hard for people to meet Before you're aware of the person, no matter how many times people pass each other, they're not really "meeting" After you become aware of the person, Then, you've really met You're right I... am glad I'm able to meet you Sorry, what did you say? Nothing Hold on tight! Grab onto my back. OK Kimio-chan! Kimio! Kimio! Kimio! Kimio! Kimio! Kimio! Kimio-chan... Welcome back, Kimio-chan! Thanks, everyone Even though we didn't win #1, to be able to sing this song with everyone... I will treasure this memory forever In my heart, I will always remember this song I've gained courage from these kids If I don't give up, wishes will come true I also need to pursue my dreams and never give up I can do it! Eh? Huh? Umm... Excuse me I'm Kae Ishitobi-san? Ah, don't come out Please hear my words from there I... like you Do you have someone you like? Or someone that you're dating? Sorry Um... It's not me if there is such a person You don't know anything, right? His heart... has always had someone in it The person in this painting is not you It's "that" person He only used you for the outlines of the picture That painting... is also "that" person I'm so embarassed, I can't believe I lost Yamada's test Ishitobi-san's name... is Ryuu, right? Yup That's his pen name His real name is... Takashi What about it? You still live in that apartment? Yup You're a teacher now, huh? Takashi... What's the matter? Here Takashi... Long time no see What are you doing? Nothing What is it? Are you hiding something? Nope Let me see it! What is it? Let me see! Look! Nothing nothing nothing! You're sneaky... I don't want to get soaked Kae-chan I heard from Hoshi I'm sorry I already have someone I like She used to live here but I was too afraid to tell that person my feelings I also didn't have the courage to paint her front face That's why...I treat you as her shadow since you live in the same place I know to you, this is mean and unfair I'm sorry Still, I hope you will still come to see my art exhibit I will wait for you Ishitobi-san! Why can't it be me? I met you! Not just brushed shoulders with you I've put you in my heart Even if that painting isn't me, but I still feel thankful and lucky that I'm able to meet you I... Sorry ?? school? 若草 Yes, I know that school, but why do you want to go? This notebook... I want to return it to its owner Are you meeting your love rival? For someone who just lost her love, you're very kind I... can't hold on to this diary forever Truthfully, I want to see this teacher What happens after you meet her? I don't know But I've learned so much from this diary I learned how to love someone purely Kae-chan... You are really in love Can I ask you girls something? OK Are you students from ?? school? Yes Then, have you heard of Ibuki sensei? Is she still at school? Um... She died What? Mano sensei died She died? What's up? Sorry, my shoe laces are loose Hey, can I ask you something? Were you in Ibuki-sensei's class? Yup Can you tell me a little bit about her? Did you know her? She's my senior (senpai), do you understand? Yes, I understand Is it true that... she died? When she left school on her motorcycle, she hit a truck On the last day of school? I really liked Ibuki-sensei Me too! Me too! Is Kimio-chan here? Kimi-chan! Kimi-chan That big sister seems to be Ibuki-sensei's junior Let's go Are you Kimio-chan? Yes I... actually, I haven't met Ibuki-chan before Right now, I live in Ibuki-sensei's old apartment I read the diary she left there Peeking at other people's thoughts probably isn't right... but I've learned a lot from reading this Ibuki's words gave me a lot of courage Look she wrote a lot about you in here I... caused Ibuki-sensei to worry a lot Sensei taught me that we all have strengths in our hearts "the strength of the heart" I also learned it from her This... what is it? On the last day of school, Ibuki-sensei threw this out of the window Kimi-chan, what's the matter? March 22nd Farewell day I didn't want this day to come A lot has happened this year I believe you're all bright and shiny children of the sun You're able to use your pure hearts and constantly strengthen class 4(2) We're a great, big family Don't ever forget the strengths of your hearts Always continue on with it Then... Today's Ibuki Medal, is for all 36 of you! Yay! Yay! First, Moriyoku-kun gets one Hai Looks good, congrats! Congrats! Here, Kimio-chan You've worked hard Great job It's really been a great year Congrats! I gained lots of power and strengths from Class 4(2) You did a great job Watching everyone's smile push me to work harder everyday Thanks everyone for giving me a great year Congrats! And then, the times when I was scary, please forgive me You've worked hard! Congrats! Don't cry 1...2... 3! Yay!!! Everyone probably know already taht because I didn't do very well on my daily column, it was cancelled midway However, Ishitobi-san did the illustrations for me, and he received good praise from both the readers and the editors Truthfully, I'm a little jealous That's why, in my next novel, I want to write about the story of a father and his daughter This way, I will ask Ishitobi to draw the illustrations first, and we can come up with the story side by side with the illustrations What I want to say is, Ishitobi's art effectively enables people to remember stories I think his work is great In the future, Ishitobi-san will... Let's thank novelist ??? Thank you! Please feel free open discussions now You came! Thank you The person in the picture, I believe we're very similar Next, invited by Ishitobi-san Performing mandolin, please welcome Kae-san! Please Please Eh, where's your mandolin? I forgot... Ah... I'm Horie Kae I came even though I don't really belong here, because I work at a pen store and met Ishitobi-san No matter what I say to Ishitobi-san right now, I won't be able to pass on to him a message of blessing and encouragement Therefore, I brought along a message from someone who couldn't be here In my room, I accidentally found a diary left by the previous owner On the last page, she left these words She's writing to the one she loves This is for Ishitobi-san Perhaps I'm exaggerating, but I think people meet each other because their destinies are connected To be able to meet unexpectedly in a limited time, I believe it's a miracle Before I met you, I was like these kids, I only knew how to dream However, words cannot describe how lucky I am right now If this is a dream, I hope I will never wake up If this is reality, even if it's only a moment, I don't care I can say proudly that I'm doing great Just thinking about you now, my heart feels warm To me, you're where the sun is Even though you seem cold on the outside, inside, your heart is like the sun I'm probably not the only one who thinks this way Because you have so much charm From your paintings, I also saw those who also felt your charm and your talent There will be many others in the future too Amongst them, you will shine brightly It's my greatest happiness if I can just stay by your side and silently protect you Takashi I'm so glad that I met you Onee-chan Onee-chan! Kimio-chan, I delivered the message! 1...2... Fly! Wow... Ibuki-sensei, thanks for the strength of your heart! I will draw and not lose to Ibuki I will continue to draw Me too I will learn from Ibuki-sensei and become a great teacher Kae-chan Yes? Thank you Hope you enjoyed this pre-release the final version of the subs will come out in the next week or so Stay tuned for YUI ^_^
