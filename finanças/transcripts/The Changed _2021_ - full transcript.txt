No one seems to care about anything lately. Good or bad. I think people are finally wakin' up. Don't start that with me. I'm not talkin' politics with you. I'm not. This is far more important. You see, that's it. You're Mr. PC. Then, bam. People are actin' different. At work, where I take lunch. Everywhere. S... something's not right. It feels dangerous. Don't you feel it? Come on, man. What are you doin'? Are you messing with me right now? There's nothing to be afraid of, Mac. You'll see. You know, when people suspect a conspiracy, but don't have any proof, that's paranoia. Yeah, just because you're paranoid. You know what Winston Churchill said? What did Winston Churchill say? Those who never change their minds, will never change anything. What the hell does that have to do with anything? Well, as always, thanks for the morning coffee. - Yeah. - I'm off to work. I'm done with your power saw. I'll bring it by tonight. Have a nice day, Mac. I just don't think I'm being paranoid. There's something goin' on. Relax, relax. Everything is... everything's gonna be fine. - We're just imagining it. - Yeah. Yeah, you're right. We're just being paranoid. Yep. Do you still love me? I guess. Most of the time. Hey, Laurie, Emily. I don't even know why she tries to talk to us. Ew. Don't hold it against them, Kim. They're just insecure. I bet deep down, they're better than that. Right. You know, you don't have to be like that anymore. Like what? Defensive. Insecure. Comparing yourself to others. Whatever, Skye. I gotta go. I'm not sure where you're going with this, Marlowe. I know how you can be. I won't get mad. That is precisely it. Your anger, Mac. So you agree? I'm your top earner for a reason. Sometimes I need to be a little intense. Anger is a poison. What are you asking me? Could you be convinced that you don't have to be angry ever again. I'm not an angry person. I just don't feel the need to agree with everyone all the time. And that's what you believe. That's the truth. That's your truth. What else is there? Oh, well. There's everything. There is everything else. Why don't you just take the rest of the day off and you can think about what we discussed. Don't tell me to fucking calm down! You calm down! My husband is not my husband. Am I in trouble? No. Patel told me you asked to go home. Yeah. It's a zoo. One of the worst I've ever seen. We need your help, Jane. Not you hiding in here. Well, Ethan, until our phones start working, I'm gonna go home. That's all there is to it. I'm sure Mac's fine. - Everything's gonna be fine. - Yeah. Everything that's going on out there, that is not normal. I have a really bad feeling about this. Look, I know I'm gonna get... - You know what I heard? - What? I heard the governor is gonna declare a state of emergency. - I don't know. - From who? From what? Are ERs filling up? How would you even know that? Our phones aren't working. Jane, there's nothing to be afraid of. What are you doing? Wait. Jane. What the fuck are you doing? Stop it! Help! Help! Get inside. Get inside! Marc! Fuck! - Did you see that? - Hi, neighbor. - I live around the corner. - You know my dad, Blake, right? I don't think so. Oh, well, I'm Sara. - I saw you this morning. - Yeah? I work out a few times a day. What were you talkin' to Bill about? Don't you think I'm pretty? What? Invite me inside. Now, I know your wife won't be home for a while. It's Jane, right? It's Jane? Hi, Kim! Hey. Later. - You saw that, right? - Yep, I saw that. - Do you know that girl? - Sara Polaski. No, I guess I don't. You notice that people are acting... - Really strange. - Really strange. Yes, my friends, too. Most of them. Something's wrong. Really wrong. - It's not just my imagination. - No, it's not your imagination. You stayin' at your Uncle Kurt's? Mom's tracking the night shift. She still makes me. I'll call my mom. Maybe she knows where Uncle Kurt hid the key this time. - No signal. - Really? - Did you change your Wi-Fi? - No. No cellular either. Come on. I'll be right back. - This is a Connecticut... - Kim! Emergency Action Notification. The Office of the Governor has declared a state of emergency. Previous notifications have encouraged residents to seek shelter at home and await further instructions. - Private residences... - Previous notifications? - Are no longer considered safe. - It's the first I've heard. All citizens and their families are now required to proceed to the nearest public school or emergency shelter where you will receive further instructions from police or military personnel. Repeat, the Office of the Governor has declared a state of emergency. Citizens failing to comply will be subject to criminal indictment. We're not doin' that! This is a Connecticut Emergency Action Notification. - ...tion. Private residences... - Mac? Are no longer considered safe. Jane should be home by now. She was only supposed to work a half day for Aliya. To proceed to the nearest public school - or emergency shelter... - You think we should go? Where you will receive further instructions - Not without Jane. - Or military personnel. Repeat, the Office of the Gov... You think this is the end of the world? Uh, I'm gonna say "no". I kinda think it might be. Okay. I've lived through my share of prophesized doomsdays. Always uneventful. This time tomorrow, we'll be lookin' at this thing like it's Y2K or 2012. What's a Y2K? Exactly. Yeah. Everything's gonna be all right. I'm sure your mom and Kurt are fine, too. Well, you seem pretty worried. No, just... just a different situation. I give you that. I have this strange feeling that nothing's ever gonna be the same again. Yeah. Like you woke up in a different world. Like that exactly. They are running the show. Again, to anyone listening, this is US Naval Captain Gregory Schneider broadcasting. I don't have a lot of time, so listen closely. This is a real threat, not a mass hysteria event or rampant paranoia. People around you, people everywhere are not themselves anymore. They've changed somehow. They're organizing, taking over. Avoid contact with anyone you don't know and even then only engage with extreme caution. Trust no one. Not completely. They've infiltrated the military, government, all civil services. The scales have tipped, people. I'm armed. Stay back! The Office of the Governor has declared a state of emergency. Previous notifications have encouraged residents to seek shelter at home and await further instructions. Private residences are no longer considered safe. It's everywhere. Are now required to proceed to the nearest public school or emergency shelter where you will receive further instructions from police or military personnel. Oh, no. ...has declared a state of emergency. Citizens failing to comply will be subject to criminal indictment. That wasn't helping. Where the fuck is Jane? Do you think anybody else heard that Navy Captain? I don't know. Maybe. What do you think that siren is? Can you just give me some space? Jesus. Who's back there? I know you're back there! I just saw people in the backyard. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - Oh, thank Christ. - Jane? Yeah. Where've you been? Give me a minute. - What's wrong? - Give me a fuckin' minute. Jane, are you okay? Fuckin' unbelievable. What's goin' on? Oh my God. - He fuckin'...it's Ethan. - What? Ethan fuckin' attacked me! - Ethan? - Yeah, I know. I mean, he's always been comin' on to me, but this time he just fuckin' went at it. - Hey, are you hurt? - Yeah. Yes, I'm fuckin' hurt! Oh, God, he was so strong. Oh! Come here, come here, come here, come here. It's okay. Please, don't touch. Stop. Mac, please, I don't wanna be touched. All right. I'm gonna fucking kill him! He kept... he kept like tryin' to kiss me. He just kept sayin', over and over again, "There's nothin' to be afraid of. There's nothin' to be afraid of." - I'm sorry, Jane. - I'll be fine. I've been dealing with it for hours. First, the security report, and then HR. Everyone was half zoned out like they don't even care. So I told 'em I was leavin'. They can fuckin' fire me. They expected you to stay and work after that? Normal people do not act that way. Do not... they can't know about this. The navy captain came on the emergency broadcast. - He said... - Uh, the signal cut out. - People are changed. - And people aren't themselves. - They... - Trust no one. They're organized. They're takin' over the military and the government. And then he's like, "Stay back, I have a gun." - It's happening. - Are you fuckin' kiddin'? It's not paranoia, it's happening. Oh my God! I mean, so many people like us. Patients, their families. Everyone's convinced that people aren't themselves. Whatever this is... it's contagious. - Something in the air? - No. No, no, I doubt. I... I mean, I... seriously, I wasn't at the hospital for five minutes before they called us down to the ER. And we still couldn't keep up. I mean, it was... I've never seen anything like it. There was car accidents, suicide attempts, assaults, - shootings. - There were shootings? - Yeah! Yeah. - This is bad, right? - Okay, d... don't panic. - JANE: Look, we... we're here, we're okay. I'll help, I'll take care of us. Just don't drink the tap water. I don't trust it. Okay? There's bottles of water in the fridge, Kim, okay? Hey, Kim. - You okay? - Not really. I don't know where my Uncle Kurt is. And my mom, I can't call her. I know. I'm worried about my mom, too. Landline's down, too. I can't reach anybody. What about your sister? I can't worry about her right now. Oh God. - I can't believe... - Bill's coming. - Mac, I don't want him in here. - I know. I mean, seriously, don't trust anyone. - I know, just... - Mac! I will handle it! Hey, Bill. Hey, Mac. I got your power saw. Jane, Kim, what's going on? Jane had a rough day at the hospital. With everything that's goin' on, we can't be too careful. What do you mean? We spoke about this morning. People aren't right. She thinks it might be contagious. Hmm. You haven't turned on the radio? No. Apparently, if we don't report to an emergency shelter, we're breakin' the law. - Oh? - Shut the door. - Shut it. - Wait. You haven't turned on your phone, huh? - Or the TV? - No. I think we could all use a little less technology - every now and then. - Shut the door. Have you seriously not noticed the way people are acting? No. Actually, I find it to be quite peaceful and all. Peaceful? Are you kidding me? Jane, Mac, there's nothing to be afraid of. Get off him! Kim, help me! Oh, Jane! Jane, where are you going? Stop it. Stop it. Get the fuck off of him. Now. What was that, huh? Just tell us. Why did you attack me? Just give us some answers here. He knows what's goin' on, clearly. He's part of it. - Say something, Bill! - Wait! Whatever this is, it's physical. Some sort of infection or virus. Rabies. That causes confusion and aggression. Not feeling like yourself today, Mr. Costello? I'm a changed man, Kim. Changed? That's right. But you're still Bill Costello. Well, who else would I be? Then tell me about last Christmas. You were here with us. Another Jane and Mac Christmas extravaganza that your mother skipped to be with her latest boyfriend. Tayden even let you sip some champagne when your uncle wasn't lookin'. When Kurt found out, he was angry at you both. Okay. You're you. Why're you acting so weird? I've been perfected. Changed. Changed, how? I was kissed yesterday by a wonderful red-haired woman. It was perfection. Bliss. Wait, so you were tryin' to kiss me this morning? - Wait, he tried to kiss you? - I thought he was kidding. That's it. That's why Ethan tried to kiss you. - That... - Yeah. That's how they're doing it. That's how they're changing people. Tell us. - What the fuck? - Now what? - Shut up, shut up. - Shh, shh! - Maybe it's Uncle Kurt. - Shh! Kim, be quiet. Stay still. - But... - Shh. Don't... don't move. - But what if it's him? - Kim, quiet. - That's his knock! - Kim, stop! None of this is necessary, Jane. Why don't you just surrender to me? Quiet. Kim, you here? Mac, Jane, you in here? What? Your car's in the driveway, but you're not home? Come on. He sounds fine to me. Yeah. Can you tell me what is this saw doin' out here on the ground? - Right. Total asshole. - Kim? Kim? Yeah, Kurt, she's in here. Well, you're gonna open the door or what? How're you doin'? I'm tired. How do you think I'm doin'? Everything okay with you? Mac, I'm beat. Long day. I wanna get Kim home, eat, and fall asleep in my chair. Where is she? Everything okay with you? You notice anything strange goin' on out there? Like what? Like people acting different? Yeah. You. You haven't noticed people acting different? What people? Most people. You know me. I mind my own business, get the same in return. Look, is Kim in there or not? Let's go, huh? I don't wanna have to make dinner twice. Did you see anyone outside the house? No. What's wrong with you two? You haven't turned on your radio? The radio? No. How about you stop asking me questions? Just tell me what the problem is. We're not sure. There's a situation and it's growing. - People are acting... - Strange. Different. They're changed. They're themselves, but they're not. You're saying you haven't noticed anything about anyone out there. You know I'm by myself all day drivin' state to state for the dealership. You haven't heard emergency broadcasts. You haven't seen anything. I listen to my music, not the radio. You're acting like a lunatic, Mac. Jane thinks it's some sort of sickness that's going around. Okay, I don't care if people are acting different or strange or if everybody in town is infected with the bubonic plague. You know, I put in over 600 miles of 95 North today. So, Kim, let's go. Now. Something's really, really wrong, Uncle Kurt. We've got Mr. Costello in the basement. Whatever it is, he's got it. - Bill? - Yeah. Yes, Bill. What's he got now? You need to come see for yourself. Are you kidding me? This... this is a joke, right? Are you not listening? What the hell did they do to you, Bill? - They tied me to this chair. - Yeah, pretty shitty job. He's not going anywhere. - Look, she's 16. - 17. I... I'm gonna kill you, guys. Stop bein' so bull-headed and just listen! No! This is a goddamn felony. - We had no choice! - He attacked me! It's true, Uncle Kurt! - Get off! - Ask him a question. Look, they are holding a man prisoner, Kim. I'm not gonna be a part of this. You are not gonna be a part of this! Tell us how you've changed. What would you like to know? What if we let you go? I'd change all of you. You'd change us. What... what's that supposed to mean? It means if you untie him, he'll try to make out with you. It's a means to an end, Kim. To serenity. Whatever this is, my best guess is that it's transmitted through saliva. Something about that compels to change - to propagate it willingly. - Oh my God. He attacked me, he tried to kiss me. That's why we tied him to the chair! Oh. Oh, he tried to kiss you. So how does that work? Like a cold that makes you different but not really? I don't know. I don't know. He's from outer space. What do you want from me? Ask him! W... what's the deal, Bill? - You into guys now? - You wouldn't believe me. - Maybe I will. - We're trying to help you. We? Who's we? What? Like little green men? No, not exactly. I'm gonna put a stop to this. Hey! Look, obviously, he's got a screw loose. - This can't be helping. - Just listen! You have no idea what the fuck is goin' on. - Stop! - Oh my God! I know. I know that you and your loony wife put us into this fucked-up situation. He attacked me, I didn't do anything! No, no, you attacked him. - You attacked him. - That's not what happened. Yeah, what do you drag a 16-year-old into this mess? Oh, you give a shit about her. Get off him! Holy fuck, Jane. What the fuck? I was attacked by my supervisor. And I've known him for five years! Then Bill attacks Mac. We have to deal with whatever's going on here, not you! So fucking listen! What does it mean to be changed? What do you wanna change us into? I want to perfect you. How? We have the power to usher in the next incarnation of your existence on this plane. You're still not convinced? He's gotta be on drugs. He's not the only person acting that way. That's what we're tryin' to tell you. All my friends, Uncle Kurt. What would that be like if we let you change us? Perfect order. Perfect satisfaction predicated by perfect productivity. We're gonna penetrate each and every one of you to reveal the face that you failed to recognize. Halcyon, days and nights, and so on forever. Perfect harmony, perfect balance. A peaceful coexistence with every living creature on this incredible, organic machine. Inside of each of you, I can unlock the true potential of humanity. Okay, so if you're not Bill anymore... why shouldn't I put you down like a rabid dog? I am Bill. Changed. Look, um, you put that gun down, Jane, - or I'm gonna take it from you. - Oh, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane. Come on. I'm just tryin' to make a point. Are you getting it? Back off. Settle down! I'm settled. Excuse me, but can I have a glass of water, please? Huh. Yeah, sure. Why not? I'll get you some water. - You got this? - I got it. Thank you. Hi. What do you want? Why don't you come outside so you can see me better? I can see you right now. Look, I just hope I didn't make you uncomfortable before. Nope, I'm fine. You like what you saw? I didn't say that. You can fuck me if you want to. I don't mind. And it'll change your life. Please, leave. Okay? Just please, leave. I said, "Go. Leave!" Mac, come on! - Wait. - They're gonna kill each other. - Wait, what? What? - Let's go! - Back up. - Oh, you don't get it. This is bullshit. Shut the fuck up. Really I'm warning you I'm gonna show you how I shoot! No, and there is no fucking magic space virus! You want me to shoot you? - Oh my God! - You're a nurse, not a fucking... You don't even know what the fuck is going on! - You're a nurse, not a doctor! - Let go of me! Back off. Just stop! There are people out there right now, definitely watching us. What? See, something's happening. It was that girl from this morning. Tried to get me to come outside. Sara. Yeah, Kim saw her. She tried to seduce me. She's pulled the same stunt. - Wait, just now? - Just now. I swear I saw people hiding in the backyard. Just before Jane got home. - I'm gonna look for myself. - Just wait! They're gonna know that we're onto them. Uh, they're gonna see you. Please, trust me. They're sitting there perfectly still watching us for God knows what. He knows. Tell us what's goin' on. You promised me a drink of water. Who are you people? We're changed. And you can be, too. Listen to me my neighbors... Everything that your friend Bill was, I am. Only better. Every detail, every human experience absorbed in perfect unity. You have nothing to lose. Everything to gain. Come on! This is bullshit. Mac, how many times have you told me that all you want is the freedom to do what you want, when you want. And I've watched you. I've watched you pursue it. Money, status, dreams. And deep down, you know it's all a damn lie. There is no happiness or freedom to be had. Species as selfish and aggressive as yours will never find peace. But if you join us, you will have the answer to every question that you'll never care to ask again. No more confusion or worry. Desires gone. No fear or doubt! You will know certainty. Tranquility. Bliss. You're gonna save us, huh? Save us from ourselves? The world as you know it is over. Be a part of this. Be with us. Mmhmm. See, the way I see it, you murdered my best friend. Mac, don't. No, come on. You don't know what's really goin' on out there. I got a pretty goddamn good idea. Yeah, well, maybe what you think is happening, - it's... it's... it's all a hoax. - Come on, Kurt. Yeah, maybe... maybe Bill's gone crazy. No. Whatever this soulless piece of shit is, he's not Bill. - Not anymore. - Yeah, but what if you're wrong? Okay, you cannot go around just blowin' people's heads off. If he's right, it's the end of the world, right? The rapture? Right, Bill? - Right? Right, Bill? - Mac! Stop, Mac, stop it! It isn't right! I know you. I know the peace you seek. - Please. - Be with us. - Mac. - Be a part of this. I need time out. Mac! Okay, okay look, Kim. I'm... I'm the one in charge now. Whatever. Kurt, can you kindly untie me? Look you just..just keep your fucking mouth shut. Oh my God. You fuckin' know me? Huh? You know what I want? Huh? You think you fuckin' know me, huh? What are you gonna do, Mac? What are you gonna do? Fucking do? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? I'll blow your fuckin' head off! Fuck! Oh my God, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think. Fuck. Come on, Mac, figure it out. Jesus. Fuck! Everything's fine up here! Everything's fine! Okay. You got this. Come on. You got this. All right. You got this. You got this. What am I gonna do? There is no good reason not to untie me. I told you to shut up. I'm thinking. The energy in this house has gotten still. Don't you think so? I mean, we could all use some... Look, would you just shut your mouth for five goddamn seconds, so I can figure out - what to do? - Both of you, shut up. You and I are in similar circumstances, Kurt. Oh, you think so? I'm not tied to a chair, I haven't gone schizo. Mac and Jane's position of power and authority is limited to this house. - Do you understand that? - No. Divide and conquer. - That's your plan? - Oh my God. Zen masters aren't above that sort of thing? Okay, none of this makes sense. I... I need you to explain to me. Explain to me what's wrong with you. I'm a changed man. Yup, changed. That much I got. Please! Tell me what you want. Have you come to join us, Kim? You guys are playin' a prank on me, right? Kim put you up to this? Are you acting in accordance with what you think is right? Listen, I don't like what's happening at all. Any of it. But there is definitely something wrong with you. Can you both stop talking? What if your actions here today, right now, were placed under the scrutiny of judgment? If this isn't a prank, I'm not responsible for any of it. I'm a victim, just like you. Always suffering for the deeds of others, aren't you, Kurt? Sleep is blindness. You know the truth, but you resent it. You'll always be alone. Loveless. Loveless? So, if I drink the Kool-Aid, - all that's gonna change? - Yes. One kiss? Yes. Okay. Okay. You are batshit crazy. If you think that my mental clarity is gone, why don't you take me to a doctor? That would be the right thing to do. She won't let me. The other loony's got the gun, in case you missed that. That's all right, Kurt. I know you're not the man in charge here. Hmm. Are you changed? Are you ready? I don't know. It feels like giving up. It's not weakness. It's strength to accept change. Life is change. Are you all connected? The same mind? No. We remain self-contained, united in the pursuit of absolute truth. I don't know, Sara. What we offer is clarity in the deepest sense, unburdened by concepts of good and evil. The changed don't see moral categories as a force to resist but as opaqueness. You remain yourself, yet like a lens wiped clean, the light can shine through. So all that I am remains? Yes. I need you to promise me that I'll still be me. Why would you want that? Your desire to stay what you are is what limits you. But you are different. You are. You're brave, that's why you're here now. The others? What I am, what you'll become, would be incomprehensible to them, except as gods. All right. Mac, get the fuck down here! Mac! You're making the right decision, Kim. Kiss me, Kim. And it'll happen. I can't. Kim. Don't fight it when it comes. Soon. Just listen. Can you fuckin' listen for once? No! How many times do we need to go through this? Guys, just settle down! Who the fuck put you in charge? Calm down, huh? Oh, well, no, easy for you to say. You're the one with a shotgun! Everybody gets a gun but Kurt, right? We shoot skeet, we're not a gun show! - Stop fighting! - We have two guns! Did any of you even notice I was gone? You know what? Fuck this. You're on your own. And when you're done torturing him, you better find a good lawyer, because I'm gonna throw the book at you two. This one's gone wackadoo and she's a fuckin' minor. Are you talkin' about lawyers right now? - You can't be this dense. - Come on, Kim. This isn't our problem. Not anymore. It's not safe out there. I'm goin', with or without you. - Are you serious? - Really? You're gonna leave your niece. That's your solution. If the world is ending, and it's not, it's gonna end for me in the comfort of my own home. Are you kidding? With everything you've seen and heard? Listen! All of you just shut up and listen! I went out there. I talked to Sara. One of my friends from school was there, too. Sara asked to change me and I thought about it. - I really thought about it. - Why? Why wouldn't I? Look at the alternative! - Are you serious? - Kim. - Hey, I didn't, did I? - You will. It's only natural to fear what you don't understand. But you want to understand, Kim. Jesus Christ. We do not know for sure what is really goin' on out there, if anything. I just told you what's going on! They know we're in here and they're coming in after us! I told you they were out there. Wait, she just said they're coming in after us? - Basically. - When? Soon. Are your people going to attack? There is a timeline. Oh, Kim. Kim, you need to mind me, okay? So let's go now. Uncle Kurt, even if you don't, the rest of us know this has been building up for at least a month. For whatever reason, you're still you and I'm still me, but we're in the minority now. We need to stick together. Kurt. Come on. I'm done. Stay here. Come with me. I don't give a shit. Uncle Kurt! Go ahead, I'm right behind you. Go ahead, Judas. Say somethin' smart. You do anything while I'm gone, I'll be the one to blow your head off. Behave. Don't go out there, Kurt! Stop. They're out there, hiding. They're not just gonna let you walk home. - Don't be an idiot. - I'm the idiot? This is all an elaborate hoax, - you'll see. - It's not a hoax. Tomorrow, you'll see! Or else you're all prankin' me! Why don't you just admit you're scared, Uncle Kurt? I'm scared, too. We all are! Don't go out there. Don't do this. What's wrong with you? You're the only one who doesn't get it. What, you wanna go home and sit on your ass? Who do you think you're talkin' to? Just like your useless bitch of a mother slut, gets herself knocked up and for the rest of my life that makes you my problem! I'm goin' home now to sit on my ass! Hey, hey! No, Mac. Hey, what... Hey, you, stop, stop, stop right there, okay? Just stop. Just back off! All of you, just... just back off! What do you want? You... you want people? There's people right... right there in that house. Get them. Right there, get them! Those people in that house! I didn't do anything. - We need to do something. - No. No. No, Mac. - Oh, let go! - He asked for this. Oh! You asked for this. - I should have helped him. - No. There's nothing we could have done. I don't know how to feel. He seems okay. He's not dead. Looks like it was painless. Maybe I should have done it, too. - Sara made it sound pretty cool. - No. You're better than that, Kim. Gee, thanks dad. I don't know why you wanna change who you are. We think you're pretty awesome. Thanks, but my life sucks. Not like Sara. She graduated when I was a freshman. Different crowd. Popular. We hardly knew each other. Now, she was nice to me. Being a teenager sucks. Yeah, Kim. You can be right. They... they seem to have it better than us. Peaceful. But rewinding the last few weeks in my head, knowing who's who, who's changed, and pretty much when... it's like they have no souls. They're missing that spark. You know, they're livin' life right alongside you. But you're not in it alone. Just like Bill. Empty. I'm not ready to give up. Life's hard. And whatever they are, they may change every single last one of us. They're gonna find that out soon enough. Good news, Bill. We're walkin' you out of here. It'd be wise if you keep your mouth shut. Don't give us any trouble. And tell your friends the next one of you clones comes to the door, try something funny, I'll start shooting. Consider it self-defense. Nah. No, you're not gonna shoot me. You're not gonna take my soul. Fear clouds the mind and the spirit, binds the concept of the soul to the body. The ego. Who says I'm afraid? You all are afraid. Every one of you. Every day of your life. Jane! - Jesus, Jane. - Stay away. Are you changed? Yes. You, motherfucker. Mac, wait. Jane. Everything's gonna be fine, Mac. Are you in pain? I feel pain. But pain no longer controls me. I control it. Jane, what am I supposed to do? What I wanna help you understand is pain. The pain I feel right now. Fear. Confusion. Doubt. No longer cover my actions. Jane, what do I do? Join us. Kiss me. If I do? Cellular organisms... are passed through saliva. We inhabit our hosts... ...become one. Is this what you want? All this chaos? Bill was telling us the truth. I've been given an enlightenment. An understanding. Where are you things from? You know I don't wanna be changed. Change is inevitable. Kiss me. I can't. I won't. I'm losing a lot of blood, Mac. I wanna live. That much about us remains the same. No. No, we're not the same. Join us. Or die. Oh. Just realize I am dying now. Jane. You're gonna help me save Jane. Come here. - Mac. - Come here. - I don't wanna kill anybody. - Come here. Break it open. Shove a shell in. Close it. Pull back the trigger. Shoot. You do it again. You understand? You've been brave since I've known you. Strong. I need you to be that girl for me now. She needs help, she's been shot! What are you waiting for? We'll get her medical attention. You better. Give me a reason to bash your fuckin' head in. I wanna apologize to you, Kimberly. I know I've always treated you poorly. Would have been nice if you realized that sooner. I know. I've changed. Join us. I don't wanna be some clone. I wanna be me. You heard her? Now fuck off! You fuckers. You okay? Yeah. When they start comin' in... I shoot first. And you go while I reload, okay? Not much. It's us or them. What if I can't? Well, then we're dead. Or you lose everything that you are. I don't know what to tell you. Nothing in life that's worthwhile is easy. It is the struggle and the fight that makes us who we are. They wanna exist through us. And you're exhausted, I see it. So am I. And they're gonna use that, so that we disappear into them. Life doesn't make any sense. But neither does that. Kurt's one of them. They took Jane from us. Those fuckers changed everything. This is it, Kim. Us or them. I'll fight with you. What else can I do? I'm Katie Walters, a face you know and trust. Now changed, for the better. I'm asking for your trust now. If you're watching this broadcast, you represent the small percentage of those still unaffected by the historical and metaphysical change your species is experiencing across the globe. By this time tomorrow, there will be no one like you left anywhere. I'm sure this confuses and frightens you. I'm here to quiet your mind. Those you know and love, those who have already crossed over have experienced no pain, no discomfort. They are alive and well, just as they were before. And now each of them reborn with fearless purpose and moral certainty. For you, a kiss is never free of desire. We simply desire to give you more. One kiss awakens belonging. No sorrow, no questions, no fear. We ask that you open your hearts and homes to those who will initiate your transition. Please open your doors to them now. Discover your deepest clarity. The alternative? Those who continue to resist will be taken by force at sunrise. Individuality and the interest of self will not be tolerated. We admire your species. Your utilitarian physical form, your adaptive nature, your inquisitive minds. We know you will make the right choice to join us. I'm Katie Walters. Thank you and good night. Hello, viewers. I'm K... What are we gonna do? Kill 'em all. Tell me again how I'm strong. I've never seen you cry before tonight. Big girls don't cry. That's what mom always says. I hope she's okay. Maybe. I'm with you, Mac. I'm sorry this happened to you. You got your whole life ahead of you. Not anymore. Yeah, well, maybe you should go out there and do it like you said. Don't be a jerk. I had a moment of weakness. That's all. Fair enough. Let me see you reload. Good. Do it again. Good. Don't forget to pull the hammer back. Not right now. Do it again. All right, shoulder it. Aim it. Aim it like you mean it. You ready to do it? All right. Good. Good. Maybe we should play a game. It might make us feel better. A game? A list. Things that make life worth living. Whatever you can think of. No rules. All right, fine. I'll start. Meat ball grinder. The smell of Jane's hair. Winning the IM. Getting drunk on a Sunday afternoon. Junior prom. Drivin' fast. Really fast. Sleeping all day. Punk rock. Summer vacation. Livin' life. Just livin'. That's what I was gonna say. This is it. You know what? Just go out the back. I got this. But they're back there, too. Hiding. Probably have us surrounded. Yeah, right. I didn't want you to go. No point waiting. God hates a coward. I go out first. I shoot first. Get behind me. Let's go. Guess what?
