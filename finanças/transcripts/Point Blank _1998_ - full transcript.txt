Forgive me, baby. Please don't go away. Forgive me, baby. Please don't go away. You'll never have to worry,because I'm here to stay. You've got to believe it. Baby, please don't leave it. Forgive me, baby. Please don't go away. From now on, baby, I wantto be right by your side. Yes, from now on, baby, I'mgoing to be right by your side. You've got to forgive me, baby. Yes, you've got to forgive me, baby. Please promise me you'll stay. If you can stick aroundmore than a month or two, you might be able to finish this thing. They're moving your brother up north today. The god damn death penalty-- I suppose it doesn't matter where you go. Well, you know, I think Joe chose that road a long time ago. DAD: I guess Joe shouldhave taken care of business in one of those third-world countries, got a license to kill like you, huh? I went to visit him lastweek, and he asked about you. How's Joe's head? Well, you know Joe. Nothing seems to botherhim except being locked up. Mm. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you look great. Your husband is going tofall in love all over again. Tracey, we out of here? Definitely. Let me just clean up around here. And I'll meet you outside in five. Did you hear Alanis is coming to Dallas? Girl, the show is sold out already. Well, what do you expect? Nobody ever comes to Fort Worth. Plaza-- Fort Worth Shopping Plaza. We're under attack! Everywhere. This ain't a joke. I'm telling you. POLICE: Get him out of there. Stay together. Settle down. All right, I got us here. Now get us out. Time for a party. We got to have a party. Let's try not to hurt anybody. Yeah, right. All hell broke loose. Your brother and some others busted out. Well, I never did see Joeletting the goddamn state put him to sleep. Killing a drug dealer is one thing. This time, there'sinnocent people involved. What are you going to do about it, son? When you get there, if there is a decision to be made about yourbrother's future, you make it. Don't let them. I haven't been there for Joe in the past. This time, I'm not walking away. He's my brother. I'm going to get him out of there. What the fuck is this shit? I'm delivering you 21st-century quality. And you talk to me like a Neanderthal. Do you know who I am? Do you know who I know, like, globally? Think yourself. The last time I saw hardwarelike this was in Kuwait. Where'd you get this shit? So you in? I ain't got nothing else to do, so. M16-203 with a grenade launcher underneath. Imagine a gun that's smokeless, near silent, with case-less ammo. It means there's nothing flying out where it shouldn't-- the case converting inside the chamber into rocket propelling for its armor piercing rounds. Get them while they're hot, boys. Billy? Yeah. Can you handle that? Oh, yeah. I can take care of things. WOMAN: I don't want to die. I don't want to die today. I want to go-- let me go home! Oh, I don't want to die. I don't want to die! I want to go home! I don't want to die! I don't want to-- Shut the fuck up! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! I want to go home! I don't want to die! That's one less fucking cowboy. NEWSCASTER: Officials speculatethat one of the escapees from the bus, convicted moneylaunderer Howard Daniels, may have been behind the breakout. Daniels' corporate headquarters is based in the same mall where the hostage crisis has taken a deadly turn. So, what do you got back there, Wood? I mean Hardwood-- just joking, just joking. Jesus, Mac, they're fortifyingtheir whole position here. Yeah, what with? I don't know what that is. Here's your profile, sir. Oh, thank you. Damn, I don't know he was on the bus-- Wallace Black. Last minute thing. Multiple contract killings, a rape, murder he got acquitted for. Then he takes out that casino owner in Reno. God damn-- 20 pieces in a dumpster. Makes the rest of theseguys look like Boy Scouts. Yeah, I don't know about that. But Joe Ray didn't just kill that drug dealer. He took out his whole operation. He did away with thecompetition, so to speak. Boy, this thing can get messy. Well, I'll be dipped. Rudy, I didn't know you were back. They'll be a triage unit set up right here. Let's keep clear of this area. Let's keep clear now. How the hell did you get in here? I learned from you, man. Well, I obviously didn't teach you very well. You wouldn't-- you know,they got me running things, at least for now, anyway. The feds will be here soon enough, though. You bet your ass. You let the feds in here, you're going to have anothergoddamn Waco on your hands. Shit, man. Don't even think about that. I mean, I suppose you know how to handle this. I know my brother. Yeah. How much time can you give me? Aw, Rudy, we don't workthat way around here no more. Oh, man, this is pathetic. It's just pathetic shit. Now he has some militaryhardware, and all we've got is a bunch of pissant 9 millimeters. Rudy! Shit. What's up with the suit, Howard? Prison blue not your color? It's the party that never ends, Joe. Step inside. Step outside. Please, enter. Make yourself extremely comfortable. Sit anywhere. Sit anywhere you like, anywhere. Sit there. Sit there. It's a gorgeous chair. It's Michael Graves. It's very comfortable. I paid $70,000 for that chair. It better fucking be comfortable. He wanted 20. I talked him down-- prick. So this is my little playground. You like, hm? I run all of my operations out of here. No one asks any questions,fabulous loading dock, perfect front, very legitimate. You look like a drinking man, Joe-- very passionate. Shall we? MAN: There's a lot of fire down here. That's enough. We had an agreement. You put up the money. I hired the guys to break us out. Then you fly our ass out of here. So where's the helicopter, Howard? It'll be here, Joe. What about the boys on the bus? Now, they weren't part of the plan, were they? Shut up. What was I supposed to do, leave them there? As far as I'm concerned, we alldeserve a chance like anybody else, except for maybe Wallace. I'm starting to haveserious doubts about you. Trust me. The only possible delaycould be a weather condition. He said he'll be here. He'll be here. Get us out of here. The feds show up, the negotiations stop. And they will kick our ass, Howard. HOWARD: On the country, my friend. It'll be fun, actually. Because I'm going to distractthem with our demands. What demands? We don't have any fucking demands! I can be quite demanding. Welcome to the big time, kid. Nice clothes. Mm. You smell good, so good. Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh. Don't move. Don't move. Sh, sh. No! Sh! Hey, fat! You're breaking my concentration. Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh. I know you want to do me, bitch. But first, we get to do my friend. Uh, uh, uh. Yeah, yes, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah. OK. Oh, yeah. Now for something real special. Oh, god. Sh, sh, sh. What the hell is this? These demands are a bunch of shit, Howard. It's called creative confusion, my friend. Take care of the men, Collum. What the fuck are you guys doing down there? Oh, Jesus Christ, Wallace,put your Dick in your pants. I got cobwebs on my nut sack. And homeboy here wants to be a hero. This will take your mind off it. Oh, that's good. That's good. BILLY: Hey! We got a problem. You know this could quite possibly go down as the stupidest goddamn jailbreak known to man. A guy gets caught 20 feet away,and you don't see anything? Hey, I didn't hear anything. Well, if the big chief herewasn't so busy trying to get himself a goddamn blow job. How about I do a blow job onyour brains all over the wall? JOE: All right, all right, allright, enough with the blow jobs. I didn't bust my ass out ofthe penitentiary to start a babysitting career with you guys. Come on, Wallace, why don't you try and take it easy on these people? Call it a hunch, we just might need them later. Look here. I didn't ask to be, right? But I'm here now. You give me two of your boy, all right? Then we'll find this son of a bitch, and I'm going to kill him. Cover me. Unbe-fucking-lievable. You, to the left-- to the right. HOWARD: No, no, no this is-- no. This is how we're going to play. See, you're the genie in the lamp. And what I'm going to do isI'm going to rub the lamp. And you're going to pop out, and give me three wishes, OK? Doesn't that sound like fun? Tell me your name, Mr. Policeman. This is Sergeant Hardwood. Ha- Hardwood? Sergeant Hardwo-- I'm sorry. Get the fuck off the phone. Give me that damn phone. Two people are dead so far. Do we understand each other? OK. I want three fully-fueled,fully-outfitted 747s. I want one at DFW. I want one at Houston Intercontinental. And I want one at San Antonio. I want new ones, none of those crappy retreads. Are we understood? Right now, I'm-- I'm getting a bit of a migraine. So I'll have to call you back. Son of a bitch. This guy's good. Hey, I could use a bump. What do you got? I said, what do you got? Oh, shit. What are you eyeballing, cop killer? You want to taste that? You want me to slice you off a chunk? Ignore him. He's an idiot. Son of a gun! Don't worry. It will be OK. Will it? I hope. What are you doing with these guys, anyway? Don't-- please. It's just hard for me to believe you're a cold-blooded killer. I'm no killer. I'm not. Anyway, what does it matter to you? Nobody gives a shit. I caught some bad luck. I had a good job. I was playing in a band in New Orleans. I was good. So I came on here trying to find another job. But no job, no money rightnow, sleeping on benches. I was starving. I was desperate. I got a hold of this little gun I found in the park, no bullets. So I went to this convenience store. I stuck this gun in this man's face. All I wanted was some goddamn food. I grabbed the keys to histruck, ran out of the backdoor. All I could think of was eatingthe shit I'd just stolen. I turned the corner a little too fast. I had some cops on my ass. God, I was scared. I couldn't see anything. I smashed into another copcar and killed two of them. I got death sentence. Hell, maybe I deserve it. No, no. My name's Tracey. Hi. SONNY: He's a killer. Watch your ass, partner. Because that's what I'm goingto be doing from here on in, looking out after my ass. Where the fuck is Wallace? We got every cop in Texas outside, Wallace. You think you could be a little more productive? What in the fuck are you doing? Well, you got a problem? Don't start, guys. We got shit to take care of here. Come on, Mama, let's take a walk. Can you hear me, cops? Do I have attention? Now, if you don't get your men out of here-- What are you doing, baby? That's going to become a habit! You scared, kid? Yes, I'm scared. Everybody's scared. Who did you kill to get here? I killed a man. 17 years in the Marine Corps-- I joined up straight out of high school. I've been everywhere I loved my job. I loved it every day. I married my-- married my sweetheart on her 16th birthday. The first time we ever laideyes on each other, I was-- what-- in the fourth grade. She was in the second. After my discharge, I had this new business. One day, I'm fighting this-- this bad flu I had. And I forgot themedication the doc gave me. So I had go on back home and get it. And I couldn't believe what I saw. It was like a goddamn nightmare. But there was my CO gettingdown with my old lady. It's kind of funny when I think about it now, that little old Marine Corps tattoo on his ass going up and down, up and down. And there he is, standing up, butt naked with a hard dick talkingabout, wait, wait, wait, you don't understand. You don't understand! I understood. I understood all too well. I just grabbed that sonof a bitch round the neck. And I squeezed. And I squeezed. And then I stabbed him 14 times. I put my knife in him. I twisted it until I wassure his heart was hamburger. I cut this throat-- Randall, model number 14. I carried that knife through three campaigns. I finally found a good use for it. Are you in charge here? I wondered when you'd boys come rolling in. San Antonio? Yeah. Say, aren't y'all the onesthat handled that Waco deal? Ouch. Now, we understand you let a heavily-armed mercenary walk right in there. Say you couldn't stop it. He was one of mine. Well, that's very touching-- for bullshit. Born in El Paso, Texas, June,1960, former Marine service in the Far East, contractcivilian mercenary in Afghanistan and El Salvador. El Salvador, right. '88 to '89. Indicted in '91, NeutralityAct, charges dropped, turns up in Africa in SierraLeone, military advisor to government, bailed out-- Do you mean want whatreally interests me here? No. What's that? Is this boy of yours wasa Texas Rangers for three years right here in Fort Worth. And I'll be damned. He walked off the job. He was my partner. Not anymore. Later. HOWARD: I want 3 milliondollar bonds, 2 in Swiss francs and 2 in Deutsche marks. I want the money wired to the Credit Suisse then to Grand Cayman. I'm going to have to call you back. While you've been in here dicking around accomplishing nothing,we've just lost five guys. Now you do what you gotta do, and you get us the fuck out of here. I'm done playing with you, Howard. You got an hour. Oh, dear, that wasn't very nice, now was it? Excuse me? I really need to use the ladies room. I'm going to have to come with you, though. Hey! Where are you going with my bitch? Don't worry. I'm ain't going to rape or kill her. I'm just letting her use the can. Oh. I think it's the other one. Yeah. Sh. Can I still pee? Knock yourself out. You know what to do. Careful-- wouldn't want to leave without you. Well, I missed you, bro. I had a feeling I'd be seeing you here. You're wasting all my guys, Rudy. I'm just doing what I gotta do, Joe. And you do it good. So what do we do now, kill each other? How do you want to handle this? How do I want to handle what? I'll get you out of here. You're my brother, Joe. I ain't going to let nobody kill you. The state's already gonna kill me. Your friend's hurtinga lot of innocent people. I can get you out of here, bro. Go home, Rudy. OK? That fag is just fuckingwith your head, bro. I know. An electrician, yes. So you're the one I come to when I feel dark. He's safe. Get it? Ooh, a wet one. Yes. Mm. Darling, fix this. Yes, much better. Well, I'm about to make anotherfew requests of our friends on the outside. If anyone needs anything special, now's the time. Don't be shy, old man. Is this Sergeant Hardwood? How are you, darling? Guess who? Well, um, I just need a fewmore requests if you don't mind. I'm feeling sort of like,well, some chocolates, Godiva-- fucking decadent. I fucking love it. Yeah, because-- well, I knowit's not very good on a figure. But I have terrible sweet tooth. What the hell? You only live once. And, uh, make sure it's the goodstuff, none of that cheap crap or I'll fucking Van Gogh someone's fucking ear. Do you hear me? No requests? Three bottles of wine, halfpint of whiskey, and a case of beer. Ooh, we're having a party. Any particular brand? Yeah. Enough of the games, Howard. Your hour's up. I"ll have to call you back. Let's kick some serious butt. Excuse me. But I think that's a terrible idea. Maybe ought to stop thinking. Start taking notes. Yeah, maybe. Maybe his ass. I saw him moving through the promenade. Have a ball, fellows. What? What the hell is that? Where'd that come from? Welcome to the Alamo, boys. We're fucked. Howard's rigged thewhole damn mall the blow. This shit's all over the place. How are we going to get out of here? Maybe we're not. Dose somebody got a quarter? Bruce fucking Lee! I just want you to know one thing. I love you. And I have never, ever, ever stopped loving you. And I never, ever will. Hey, now, calm down, baby. Calm down, will you? What's the matter, huh? What's the matter, baby? I want you to get thesepeople out of here, Billy. We're running out of time. Who the fuck are you? Nobody. Well, you've got to be somebody. Joe's my brother. It's your movie, soldier. I ain't looking forward tospending the rest of my life in no cage, mister. Oh, shit! No shit. Hurry up! What's the matter, baby? Who's the bad baby? Who's the bad? Ow! God! What you doing, Howard? Leaving without me? Of course not, Joe, for Christ's sake. We thought you were dead.- Shut up. Just shut up. Oh, Joe, Joe. Joe, I know you're probablyafraid of dying here. I certainly am. I ain't afraid of dyinghere or anywhere, Howard. I am afraid of doing it without you, though. HOWARD: Oh, god, Joe, Joe. I have a little surprise. There's a tunnel, a tunnel, Joe. It lead to the old stormdrains about a mile away. Leaving without me, Joe? That wasn't very nice. Howard, old man, pick up the phone. Pick it up. Pick it up! Howard, yes, send someonedown here, please. Howard, please-- oh, fuck you, you fucking-- put that on the line. I don't know who. Someone's trying to kill me. Oh, Christ, do something. Do something. I'll call you back. You'll be unconscious in 20seconds, dead in three minutes. Joe. Sh. Hey, Rud. I'm right here. I should have stayed on the bus, huh? RUDY: Sh. Hey, it's OK, all right? Yeah. Yeah. Tell the old man I'm sorry, yeah? He knows. I'd sure like to smoke a joint. I got a joint, Joe. Where the fuck did you get bud? I got it in your glove compartment. You're driving my car?
