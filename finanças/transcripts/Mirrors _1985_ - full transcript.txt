Does that mean you're gonna write a big story about us? - I don't know. I wonder-- - Yes? - There was a pale blonde girl in the second row in pink. - Karin Bradley, you have good taste. She's one of our best youngsters. - What will happen to her? - Dance is a demanding master. When the girls get to be 17 or 18 they may develop other interests. Too bad we can't neuter them. Would you like to talk to Karin? - I was thinking of centering the story on her. I don't know the first thing about dance. But if I can focus on one person-- - I'll go and get her. (upbeat music) - What's the matter? - What the hell do I know about ballet? - Then why'd the paper send you? - Because the dance critic just had a baby and my editor has a morbid sense of humor. - [Karin] What do you usually write about? - Graft. Political corruption, crime. Ever been arrested? - Sorry. - [Reporter] You don't live with your parents. - I can't. It's too far from the conservatory. Dad works at the Ford plant in Wayne so I moved to Detroit with grandpa. - Yeah, he's a minister right? (loud slurping) How old did you say you were? - 17. How old are you? - 27. I'll be 28 in three months. - I'll be 18 in 10. (loud slurping) - You want another soda? - [Narrator] The United Auto Workers have selected the Ford Motor Company as the first target in this years negotiations with the big three auto makers. Speaking for the UAW, Russell Noland announced this morning that the board talks would begin next week. (loud ringing) - Yeah. - [Karin] It's me! - Me? Me who? - [Karin] Karin Bradley, the girl in the story! - I know who Karin Bradley is for crying out loud. - It's here, I just got it! What can I say?! What can I do?! (loud doorbell) Hi. - Here. - Oh thank you! - I made a reservation at Guido's. I hope you eat Italian. - You won't believe this. - What? - I just hung up this second! - On what? - I've got a job dancing in a recital for people because of you Shakespeare! And you said you couldn't write a good story. You genius. It's okay, grandpa won't be home til 11. - It's got nothing to do with grandpa. This is what I was afraid of. - Why? - Why? Because you're barely 17 years old. - [Karin] So, you're only 10 years older than me. - Karin-- - You know what you're acting like? A kid. - Fine, one of us better start acting like a kid. Karin, listen to me. I don't want to be your first lover. - Who said you would be? You don't wanna make love to me? - [Reporter] That is a world class lie. - Then? - Is this your first time or isn't it? Tell me. - Yes, but I've been thinking about it for months. Years. - I hate to tell you this, but that doesn't count. Karin, none of this is your fault, it's mine. You're just, too old for me. (solemn music) - If you wait much longer I'll be 19. Oh and I've taken care of that other matter. You can't be first anymore. You wanna be third? - This is blackmail. - God is the supreme umpire. We may think we have fooled him, but he is keeping a score card on every one of us. Marking down each error. Mr. Philips. - Yes sir. - If you were asked to name the world's greatest athlete in any sport, who's name would come to mind? - Babe Ruth. - Oh it's a reasonable answer. But forget Babe Ruth, even Jake Dempsey. Stand up. - [Karin] Oh I was just stretching my-- - Stand up. Feel that stomach. - [Philips] Pardon? - Feel her stomach. - Papa-- - It's quite alright May this is scientific research. Well go on young man, reach across the table and poke her stomach. You call that a poke?! Dig in young man, dig in! You can't hurt her! (faint moaning) (loud thunder) - Karin. Karin. Karin what? What is it? What's wrong, what do you want? - Candy, in my bag. Please. (loud thunder) Candy. It's not what you think. - Oh, what is it? - I have to take it. - [Philips] What? - Insulin. - Diabetes? You've been hiding it from me for a year and a half? - People change when they know. They think I'm gonna blind or drop dead in front of them. - What, what if this happens on stage? - Pockets in my dance clothes. I sew them in so that I can sneak a bite of candy if I feel something happening. - Sneak?! - I can't stop the music and say wait a minute. See, once you know about it that's all we talk about. - Where are you going? - Home. - Your grandfather is in Lansing. - What if he calls and I'm not there? (loud sirens) - Does he usually call in the middle of the night? (slow paced music) You alright? - Yeah. Are you? (applause) - Yeah, bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo, bravo! (solemn music) - [May] Papa! Papa! (faint knocking) - [Philips] Hi. What is it? - Nothing. Something, may I come in? - Yeah of course. - [Karin] You're working, I'm sorry. - Oh no it's okay. May I take your coat? - I can't stay. - I know how you feel. You lost your cheerleader. - It's not that. I'm rich. Grandpa's will he left me money for my career. No, please stay there. I've got $3,000 so... - So? - So I'm, I'm leaving for New York. - When? - Tomorrow morning. So it's okay? - No. It's not okay. What did you expect me to say? - Exactly what you're saying. But I came over here to tell you that I love you. And that I'm going to New York. To study, to dance. If I'm good enough. - There are newspapers in New York. - But you'd have to start all over again. - [Philips] I'm willing. - I'm not. You're practically famous here. You're not giving your career up for me. - And you're not giving yours up for me. - Chris. I've been waiting my whole life. Ever since I was six. I didn't really believe I'd ever have a chance like this. And now I do. I feel like I'm gonna die without you. And I may be back in a week. - And you may not. - And I may not. (slow light music) (loud thuds) (slow light music) (music too loud) - I never actually read them. - Ever wonder why? - My name's Gino Rey. I know your first name of course, but-- - Bradley. - Hi. - I want it on the record that I had nothing to do with this-- (loud thuds) - Want to talk, be an actor. Want to be dancer, dance! (slow light music) - Weren't you here last month? - I thought maybe-- - [Receptionist] No auditions. Mr. Joffrey isn't seeing anyone. (loud ringing) (slow paced music) (light music) (applause) - What's the matter? Face it kid, you're not going anywhere until you explain the water works in class. What's that? - The end of the road. I'm going back to Detroit tonight. What are you doing? - There is an audition this afternoon and I'm taking you with me. - I've been to every ballet company in New York! - This is Broadway, a new musical. - I am not a Gypsy. - [Brunette] Terry! No not yet you're not. - Diane the ticket. - After the audition. - Gypsy's have to do everything. I can't sing, I can't act, and I've had three jazz classes in my whole life. - Ready? - For what? - [Diane] The audition. - I'm not going. - Would somebody please tell me what's going on here today?! My horoscope didn't say a word about all this stupidity. - Do you mind if we don't argue about this right now? It'll just be another humiliation like last time, and the time before. (loud thud) Ow! - Terry sometimes forgets that he is the greatest Gypsy who ever lived. (loud honking) - [Karin] A Gypsy's a Broadway dancer. - [Diane] So? - [Karin] I'm a ballet dancer. - [Diane] You're a dancer, this is Broadway. In two hours you'll be a Gypsy. Just watch Terry. - Yeah well if I'm so great would you please tell me why in 20 years I never got the Gypsy Robe?! - Point! - What's the Gypsy Robe? - Fame, recognition, flory. Every opening night it's passed on to the most deserving dancer in the new show. - Which eliminates me. Look, Sonny picks kids. And God knows I am no kid. (loud thud) That hurt. - That was the general idea. You'll dazzle them with your footwork. - [Terry] You'll never see my footwork. Sonny will laugh with the boys and tie me out the first five minutes. (faint taps) (loud snapping) (upbeat music) - 237 and 238. (upbeat music) See the buns on 234? They have got to be in the show. - Have you caught the boobs on 233? - [Narrator] You can not let talent like that walk out of the theater. - [Narrator] Okay girls, relax please. - [Narrator] How about 231? - Miss Personality? - Ooh. She's a little balletic for the choreography I'm planning but, dynamite technique. - [Narrator] I don't know Sonny, she's a little bit skinny. - That's what interests me. She can double as the little boy in act two. - That's right. - There you are gentlemen. The two center groups are your dancing chorus. The side groups are runner ups. Is this your final decision? - Now let's not rush this, we're gonna have to live with it for a long time. - He means that literally. - Wally is an experienced producer Sonny. He's thinking of the show. - He's thinking of fun and games in Philadelphia. - Sonny, I'd love to have you reconsider number 233. She really does dress up the line. - Okay. Kevin, would you ask 233 to come back in. And 234 would you step out? - Would you step out please? (perky music) - 233 is in. - 233 in. - Alright yeah, yeah! - Okay, everybody in the A groups, rehearsal in two weeks in this theater. The B groups will be our alternates in case of replacements. Thank you all very much. (cheering) - [Karin] We're in! - Incredibly, indisputably in. - Okay, you can have it back now. Cash it in or hold it til rehearsals. - Okay. - [Narrator] Alright kids, pick up the schedule. Five weeks of rehearsal then three weeks in Philly. - You said you're not exactly nuts about the place you're living in right? - Right. - And we have this extra room. So, Terry and I thought, what about three roommates? - Maybe when the show opens in New York. - But we've got a month before we go to Philly. What's wrong with now? Oh look, if you're worried about Terry, it's just a matter of time 'til he's working again. With his talent-- And we haven't even shown you the number one advantage of the room. Da da da da da da da! Unobstructed view of a giant TV screen, courtesy of Reggie. - Reggie from class? - Yeah. He bought the TV when he hit the lotto last summer. Now, if you want him to change channels all you gotta do is yell. He's into democracy. - And bondage. It makes a refreshing change from all those I Love Lucy reruns. - So, what do you say? The three Mouseketeers? - I don't wanna take your workroom. - What's the difference? Look, I'm not making it as a designer either. It's not enough to be gay, you've gotta have talent. (loud slap) - So, looks like it's fine with everybody right? - Yeah yeah. - Okay, nothing left but the roommates oath. Do you solemnly swear that you will never check out, chat up, or mess around with your roommates boyfriend so help you David Merrick? - I do. - I do. - I do. Oh yay! (laughter) - [Diane] I bet you're heartbroken to leave this place. - [Terry] Come on. I didn't see any tears. - Taxi! Yo! 53rd between eighth and nine. - [Terry] Come on, come on, the meter's running. - [Diane] Are we gonna get hernias? How did you get this up there by yourself? Let's go come on! - [Narrator] No visit to the beautiful people. - I've never had anything made on me before. - Well I can't have my roommates looking like bag ladies on their opening night. - Boo, Reggie Reggie! - Yeah! - This channel is the pits. - Yell when you see what you want. - Hold it! Ooh ooh ooh, we've got some ballet here. Oh, that's gorgeous. (slow paced music) - That's how it started for me. All of a sudden I saw my whole life there on the screen. - Yeah? Me too. It was some Broadway dance number on the Ed Sullivan show. I don't even remember what it was but my mom and pop never knew what hit 'em. Two days later I was taking tap, acrobatics, and ballet. (laughter) I used to practice my tap in the bathroom for the echo. It sounded like all 36 Rockettes got lost in there. (laughter) The neighbors threatened to sue! But I was happy, God was I happy. And I still am. - [Karin] What turned you on the first time? - Actually my first time goes back a little bit farther than Ed Sullivan. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Them flying down to Rio. - A little bit farther? - It was a revival at the Museum of Modern Art. (loud grunting) Ignore her, menopause. - You couldn't pick a better model for yourself than Fred Astaire. - He's talking about Ginger Rogers. - At least she had style. You've never seen the film? - No. - There is this incredible number. Try to imagine, dozens of chorus girls, in little white shorts dancing on the wing of a plane. And they're singing my all-time, number one, absolute favorite song. Hit it. ♪ My Rio, Rio by the Sea-o ♪ ♪ Flying down to Rio ♪ ♪ Where there's rhythm and rhyme ♪ ♪ Hey feller, twirl that old propeller ♪ ♪ Got to get to Rio and we've got to make time ♪ Up girls. Take it. ♪ You'll love it, flying high above it ♪ ♪ Everything will be okay ♪ ♪ We're singing ♪ ♪ Winging our way to you ♪ (laughter) (loud buzz) Somebody expecting company? - I wish. (loud buzzing) - Do you mind? - No. (loud scream) (loud buzzing) - Who are you? - Isn't that a rather odd question considering it was you who rang my bell? - Oh. Sorry, obviously I got the apartment number wrong. There's a girl named Karin Bradley who lives someplace in this building. - Here. - Pardon? - Karin lives here. Come on in. Whom shall I say is calling? - Chris Philips. She'll recognize the name. Isn't that Karin's bathrobe? - I'll tell her you're here. - Chris! What's wrong? - What's wrong? I come 700 miles to find some guy walking around in your bathrobe? - We'll go for a walk, two minutes. Terry and I are like sisters. - [Chris] Your sister's lucky, I almost punched him out. - [Karin] He'd be flattered to death. His first fight over a girl. - [Chris] I don't understand why you didn't tell me. - [Karin] I told you I was moving. - You told me about Dianne, period. - Please Chris, can't we just be happy? This is such a wonderful surprise. - Obviously. - Well it could be wonderful. (slow paced music) How long have we got? - As long as we want. (loud bells) I quit my job. - No. - Apartment, car, and job, it's all gone. So you're stuck with me. As soon as I find a job we can look for a place to live. - What are you talking about? We've got one. - Morning. - Hi, Diane in here? Hey Terry, Terry. - [Terry] In here. - Morning. How'd you sleep? - I don't know, forgot to take a number. - Oh this is Gus everybody. - Hi Gus, Chris. - Gus. - Hi Karin. - Oh Wallace, hi I didn't even see you there. Have you met Chris? Chris Wallace. - Wallace. - Chris. - Wallace, Gus. - Gus. - Wallace. - [Terry] Gus, Terry. (light music) - Terrible! Take five. (upbeat music) - We're gonna have a wedding! Opal and Ernie got engaged last night! (applause) - Okay okay, hold it down. May I suggest you save a little energy for the show? If that isn't asking too much. - Okay, we've got some serious business to take care of. Now, Opal says she wants to get m
