Is he trying to ruin me? How can he not write a book for 7 years? That jerk... Right, sir. Jerk. But it hasn't been 7 years yet. I get twice the deposit if he's late. Yes, sir. He can't run with my money. Of course not. He can't even walk. Leaving, sir? I sent Hyun to Switzerland to write. He'll return with a draft soon. Don't worry, sir. - No, he's not. - What? Mr. Kim is in Korea now. Explain that. But... What are you talking about? He's in Switzerland writing a book over instant noodles! Got proof? What? FISHER OF THE MONTH JULY 2020 Gotcha! PERHAPS LOVE The sunlight stings. The wind stings too. Shit. My damn life stings the most. The train will soon arrive at Gwangchun Station. Hyun. Professor Kim Dong-ju passed away. Hurry! Thank you. Excuse me. It's you. Right? No, I think I look better. HAPPY 70TH BIRTHDAY PROFESSOR KIM DONG-JU! You look so hot! You look so hot! Happy birthday! - I'm dying. - It's so high. Hi, bud. Kim Hyun! Why's he dressed for a funeral to a birthday bash? Sun-mo said Professor Kim passed away. How else would he come? Bastard. So author Kim. Aren't you writing? Where is your next book? He writes for a living. Of course, he's writing. He's got many mouths to feed. Why do you care if I write or not? Listen, guys. He's not one to starve because he's not writing. He gets by on incentives? Wow, that's nice. Then you must make some good money, too. I wish. It's not the same for a publishing company. I'm losing money trying to support him. - Who is it? - Never mind. Is he dating someone new? It's probably his mom. It said, 'Brook Shields'. If he named his mom that, I'm cutting ties. Freak. 4 PM, MEETING WITH TEACHER Shit, I forgot. He doesn't concentrate in class or do his homework these days. I asked if something is wrong at home, but he won't say. Son? Is there a problem? There isn't. I tried ramen for the first time. It tasted like a slight deviation from the existing order. From some point on, I've lost the taste of ramen. The same taste has never returned. Why don't you take my calls or text me back? I don't get why you're acting like this. Let's break up. What? I'm pregnant. What? How? We didn't do it. It's not your baby. WHOSE IS IT? You're Nam Jin's dog, Nam-soon? Stop staring, bitch! You scared me. Did you go golfing? Why are you here? I went to Professor Kim's funeral. That jerk is dead? No, I mean his birthday party. I came to see if you're dead. I'm not, so scram or I'll kill you. My mom picked this in the hills and made it. It's smells so good! It's better than ginseng. She insisted that I drink it with you, son of a bitch. Poor mom didn't know that you stabbed me in the back. I didn't stab you, man. Move your hand before I twist it off. Stabbing with a knife is not the only way to kill. Your damn mouth can kill someone too! What? My book is just full of cheap, gay sentiments? You wrote that in my book review! How can you dissect my book like that? Would you like it if I say your book is full of cheap, straight sentiments? - Probably not. - Then why'd you tell the world that I'm gay? You killed me! I didn't say you were gay. You asshole! If I have gay sentiments, that makes me gay! Son of a bitch. You've become so lame after a few hit books. - Come back. - Let go! I don't want to see you. Get lost! Damn it. Do you know why you can't write, sir? I can't write? Isn't that why you don't write? So, why can't I write? You're scared. To lose what you have. - Want a drink? - No, I can't drink. Why did I come here? Mr. Kim. I'll drive you to the station. It's okay. I'm a grown man. Thanks for the ride. Please take good care of Nam Jin and write well. What the hell? GWANGCHUN STATION Give me one? Thanks. That's not how you smoke. Breathe in and gulp it down. Watch. Try it. That's it. That'll get you killed faster. Thanks, kid. What the hell? Hey! Don't smoke in your uniform. The husband too? Are you retired? Done writing? Are you dating a hunter? Why are you wearing fur inside the house? Were you baking or something? - Disgusting. - It's sweet. It shows your wife is abroad. Why'd she take your kid to study abroad? When is your wife coming back? When she's done, I guess. Aren't you getting married? Why would I do that again? I'm going to just date till I die. If you find someone nice, get married so Sung-kyung... Forget it. Worry about yourself. You get crummy living alone. Who are you calling crummy? Look. I don't have wrinkles. I still have plush, porcelain skin! I still have a hot body with big boobs and no tummy. Who says I'm crummy? That's crazy. See? I'm hot. Am I hot or what? You're hot. Think it's easy to look like this at my age? Probably not. What are you looking at? You said to see. - Where's Sung-kyung? - Tutoring. Maybe we shouldn't do this? Maybe. - No. - Okay, get off. Hi, son! Oh, no! Go on! Hurry! Me? Go and talk to him! What do I say? Just go! Hurry! Nice. Dad, how can you have an affair with Mom! Then why'd you get divorced! Ah... Let me explain, Sung-kyung. - I don't know what you saw... - What do you think! I saw everything! Sung-kyung. I couldn't meet your teacher today, right? So your mom was telling me what happened. Then, somehow... You know, we had a few drinks and things heated up between us... You know, you have a girlfriend. Understand? Get out. Why you... - Haven't done it? - Get out! How could you! Why! Why! Why! - Honey? - Hi. Take this. - Where's the chicken? - I forgot. What? Just joking. Hands up! Put this over you like this. Now, enjoy your meal. You look like a noire but you're a walking romance book. I know you love me. My Brook Shields. You'll love what I prepared for you. Where is it? Tada! What's this? I planned our trip to Gangwon-do. What do you think? Crazy, huh? It's crazy, all right. I stayed up all night finding all the good spots. It almost killed me. - Isn't it to die for? - Maybe. - Right? - Yup. Look here. I put in meditation in a white birch forest too. Meditation. I can't wait for that the most. THE SILENCE WEIGHED DOWN MY ENTIRE BODY Hello? Who? You didn't have to... Why'd you come without Nam Jin? What do you mean? Forget it. You must've misunderstood. I was just visiting for a few days. I thought you were especially close with him. Hungry? I was about to order some food. How about beer? You said you can't drink. Did I say that? What's with him? Your wife is beautiful. Yes, but she sucks up all my money. You married twice, right? Sorry. Don't be. Now, get to the point. Did Nam Jin tell you to spy on me? Not at all. I'm not interested in your relationship with him. You should care. Pardon? You're a writer. You gotta have interest in relationships. Especially when conflict is the best subject matter. So, why'd you come? Whenever I get drunk, the next day, I remember everything. What time is it? Aren't you going home? It's okay. I'm not busy today. That's not what I meant. Stop drinking. Where's my phone? Where do you live? I'll call you a cab. Don't call it. I can go home by myself. I'm a grown man. Why you... What's your address? I love you. The View? I said I love you. I'm in love with you, sir. Must be completely drunk. Get up! Stand up straight! YU JIN THIS IS MY NOVEL. PLEASE READ IT. - Hello. - Hi. You'll be submitting at least two shorts this term. If you can't, there's the door. I'll call the attendance. - Kim Do-hee. - Yes. - Seo Jung-hyun. - Yes. - Lim Ho-young. - Yes. - Kim Dong-hwan. - Here. Yu Jin? Here! - Hello. - Hi. Did you have lunch, sir? - You're a student here? - Yes. - You didn't tell me that. - You didn't ask. Since when? Last year, but I took it off when I learned you're on sabbatical. For what? Do you remember last night? Yes. You can change courses till this week, so do it. It reeks. - Hyun! - You came? Clean up, will you? What's with this dump? I'm cleaning. What's this? That's nothing. YU JIN YU JIN Let's eat. You're so cheap. Why not go out to eat? I want tuna. Shut up and eat. Can you please write a book, Mr. Kim? Then I'll go deep-sea fishing and catch some tuna. I'm working on it. If you don't produce this year, you'll have to fork up everything. The investors are out of patience. If you pass the deadline, you'll have to pay $1 million! Why didn't you write during your year off? I heard your dean asked Moon Ae-ri to teach next semester. Says who? Who else? Moon Ae-ri. Is she qualified to teach? She's nominated for the Booker Prize. Just nominated. That's still amazing. If she wins, she'll be set for life. Why would they pick her? Think they're nuts? Use your head. Get with the program, man. Younger writers are beating you. - Aren't you going home? - I will. I'm going on a business trip. Where to? Can I come? For what? Cut the nonsense, man. What do you mean? You know I love nonsense. Get lost. I'm using your bathroom before I go. Jeez... What? Do something with your son! What do you mean? Sung-kyung says he's done studying. He's not applying to college. He locked his door and won't come out! Good. His tutoring was expensive. You promised to pay child support until he graduates from college. If he doesn't go this year, you'll just pay me more. Why? Wanna see our agreement again? It doesn't specify his age. It just says until he graduates from college. Mi-ae! Keys! Kim Sung-kyung! Go away! - Sung-kyung. - Get out. - Don't come in! - Okay, okay. Sung-kyung, listen to me. What your mom and I did... Why not go to college because of that? - Jeez. - I'm sorry. Listen, what Mom and I did... It's like bank interest. - What? - We lived together for many years. With the years piled up, the interest matures to attachment. Attachment is like interest! You'll understand when you get divorced. Wait. I'm sorry. I must be out of my mind. Your mom and I lived together for many years, right? The feelings just don't disappear because we get divorced. Then you did it all this time? Huh? So into details... He's my son, all right. I can't believe this. I'm going on a business trip. Stay with Sung-kyung and talk to him. Why go all the way to Gangwon-do to sell insurance? I wanna go too. Crazy jerk. Why? You cursed. Stop it. You always swear. Give me food. Hey! - Did you call me? - No. Come on, Mi-ae. I give you a lot every month. Can't you give me one meal? I'm getting that money because you cheated on me with some bitch! Fine. Don't scream. - Listen. I'm talking to you! - Don't swear! Don't slight me! Don't come again! $3180 AUTO-TRANSFER TO SONG HAE-JIN $3000 AUTO-TRANSFER TO PARK MI-AE BALANCE $180 $180? What a shitty life... I told you to change courses. Is it wrong to confess my heart to the one I love? Yes, it is. Ignoring the other person's feelings is assault, not love. Cut it out and sit elsewhere. Go on! Jeez... - What are you doing? - You said to sit elsewhere. I didn't come to confess to you. I didn't say that expecting you to love me too. - My feelings and the class... - Keep studying hard. See you next time. Did you read my novel? Novel? Did you publish a book? No. Does anyone call you an author? No. Isn't it weird to call it a novel when you're not a published author? - Then what do I call it? - A rough draft. - Did you read my rough draft? - Nope. Crazy bastard! What's wrong with him? - What? - Yu Jin! Yu Jin! I found it in your study. Why'd you take it without telling me! Hyun, I have a good feeling about this. I get the feeling it's going to be a huge hit! You sly fox. When did you write it? Let's turn it into a book. I'll catch the tuna for you! Cut the crap and bring it back! Is he out of his mind? LET'S PUBLISH IT! YU JIN You wanna stay home by yourself? Not going to your dad's? How many times do I have to say it? Are you going through puberty or something? - You always say that when I don't listen! - Why you! Why you! Don't worry! I'll just study at school and tutoring anyway. To go to college. Okay. I made food and put in the fridge. Don't eat ramen. Instant food is bad for you. - Call your dad if you don't wanna eat alone. - Dad is worse for me. Still, stay with him. I'll tell him to drop by often. - Bye. - See ya. SUNG-KYUNG HAD AN APPENDECTOMY AND IS HOSPITALIZED. HE'LL MISS SCHOOL FOR A WHILE. That's fine. Ask if he needs anything. Just get him whatever he wants. Take care! - I think Kim Hyun is dating. - Doubt it. Doubt it. It's true. His writing is back. I can feel it. - He's writing? - Yup. What can I say, it's very rough and sharp from the first page. What does that have to do with dating? Is he writing a love story? His writing is more detailed and delicate now. Honey. Kim Hyun can't date. I can assure you. Come on. What bitch came and touched his heart this time? I'm not sure. I just have a feeling. How many years have you known him? 30 years. Then it's not a feeling but a fact. You said he can't date. No, maybe he can. Old memories just came back to me. Well, whatever. Done? Let's go. We have so much to do today! Honey? Didn't we come here to rest? - What is it? - Professor Moon is asking if you're coming to her lecture. Why didn't she ask me herself? - Tell her I'll go. - Yes, sir. You've reached your destination. Are you lost? Are you looking for someone? - Who's there? - It's me, Sam. Some old guy came looking for you. It's the Republic of Uzupis. It's an artists' village in Vilnius, Lithuania. It celebrates its independence annually on April 1st. It's a country that exists for just one day a year. Everyone has the right to die and the right to happiness that day. It's not a sandwich panel. Nice. It is a sandwich panel. TO: YU JIN KIM HYUN 'EMPTY SPACE' Can I smoke? Of course. But didn't you quit? Started again because of some crazy fool. Aren't you going to ask why I'm here? Did you read my rough draft? No. Thanks for the drink. - Leaving already? - Yes, I gotta go. Don't come out. What about my rough... How embarrassing! Damn it. Hey! - Going to tutoring? - Yes. Dressed like that? Who says I can't wear this? Well, it just looks too loose. Why don't you ever greet me? I don't think I need to, ma'am. Why you little! Wait! You're not going to tutoring, are you? Where are you going, ma'am? Don't know. What about you? - Why? - I'll follow you. Hold on. That man! Hey, hold this. Honey! Hey! Wait for me, kid! I can't believe I bumped into him. - Is he an old friend? - The first guy I slept with. I think you're bad for me, ma'am. Not good, for sure. So, where are you going? Fly! Okay! Passed ya! Came like the wind Loved like fire Flowed like clouds Jin-jin-jara, Ji-li-ji-li-ja Jin-jin-jara, Ji-li-ji-li-ja FOREST MEDITATION Okay. - I got it. - What? What? That's why he returned to Korea alone. An affair. He got caught by me. So he let his wife study abroad for it. Honey, know what I see now? Many women wearing the same sables at his funeral. Okay. I'm gonna dress stylishly! Damn insect! The dress you recently bought is nice. Wear that. Honey, we'd better get going. We can't. There's 29 minutes left. Thank you. I'm very nervous. Have you had lunch? - Yes! - Good. I got too nervous and couldn't eat. I graduated from here over 17 years ago. I'm honored to give a lecture like this here. And author Kim Hyun, whom I respect dearly, is here. I feel bad and embarrassed too. Let's give him a big hand! Enough! For this year's international Booker Prize, 16 authors have been selected. One of them is our very own, author Moon Ae-ri! Please, don't applaud me yet. She says no applause yet. It's more embarrassing if you fail after all the hype. How much is the prize money? Nothing yet. But I'll get 1,000 pounds for being nominated. How much is that? About $1600. What? Why so little? If I win, I'll get $90,000. That's if you win. Are you writing, sir? Your book should come out within this year. Anyone want ice cream? Me! - Hello. - Hi, sir. - We'll head back in. - Okay. - Why? - Bye, sir. Sir. What? You know I'm your fan, right? You should win the Booker Prize before me. People may say you've lost your genius, but I believe in you. I know you'll write a great piece again. You can do it! Is that supposed to console me? - Or insult me? - Professor! Professor! - Yes. - Yes. I meant Professor Moon, sir. They're looking for you inside. I'll head in, then. - Daddy! - Hi, princess! Hi, princess! No, Daddy! Drunk again? Mom! Dad became a flamingo! I can't put up with you anymore! - I miss you too. - Daddy can't speak English. - Hello? Hi, honey! - Hi. Oh my gosh! How much did you drink? - Not too much. - How could you! Put Eun-yoo back on. Daddy! Move, you son of a bitch! Don't curse at me, you bastard! Come back here! Run me over, why don't ya! Right! I'm the son of a bitch! You know me, asshole? How dare you, son of a bitch! Screw you! Why are you here? Take it. Stop right there! I have no other intentions with you. Don't get me wrong. If it wasn't for my shitty situation, I wouldn't be here. But I'm in a rush. I'm honored. Honored, my ass... Let's set this straight. I don't care how you take it. I totally love women. I slept with only women since 18 and will continue to do so. I get what you mean. You were born like that and I was born like this. That's right. - We just work. - Okay. A new writer? Isn't that risky? You said the draft was good. Yes, it was... I think it'll be a good book. I'll work hard on it. Okay, fine. Do your best. But a new writer is risky. Is the new writer a girl? Is he having an affair with her? Who cares? Shouldn't his publisher know? You should know to tell the good and stop the bad. Honey. Can we please stop talking about Kim Hyun? Why must we talk about him all day? Since when did we not talk about Kim Hyun? - Right, but... - You talk about him too. Yes, but I'm not curious about who he dates and such! I could be curious. Why? Why are you overreacting? Forget it! Just eat. The chicken sucks. What's up? Startled? Did you eat? Wait. Hold on. Perfect. Isn't it the same? Go on. Eat it. KIM SUNG-KYUNG Your name means Bible? Is your dad a pastor? No. He's an author. An author? Who? Kim Hyun. Know him? If I don't, am I stupid? No. There's no need to know him. - I think you're still immature. - Pardon? Pardon? No! The average life expectancy is longer, so I'll mature later! What are you doing? How was it? "Art Museum by the Zoo". Don't know that movie? - Ma'am. - Yes? Are you on drugs? No way. I'm an actress. - What? - You can search me up. Welcome. For a full-length novel, how about adding mystery to add more tension? - Your thoughts? - Mystery sounds good. Mystery sounds good. You're the young man and I'm the old man. Expand the relationships by adding the old man's wife in a triangle. - Isn't that more thrilling? - Yes. Don't look. I'm not. I can't see you. It's patience, not writing skills that make writers. - Pardon? - I mean write on your butt not with your head. We have to submit within a set time, so stay on pace. But I'm hungry. How many pages have you written? If I type it up, it'll be about 20 pages. Really? What about you, sir? Let's eat. What have you got? You can sleep on the mattress. It's okay. I'll sleep on the floor. You'll be uncomfortable. I love being uncomfortable. Lights out. You're gonna sleep? Of course. It's our first night, how about a drink? What first night! And I'm not drinking with you. Lights out. It feels strange with the lights off. Lights on! Are you okay, sir? I slept so well. The person you are calling... Why isn't he answering? How long do we have to ride this? It's on the schedule. Look. It's not even halfway? Let's go! Do you have a girlfriend? We broke up a few days ago. You actually had one? Why'd you break up? She got pregnant. It's not my baby. Damn bitch... You said it. Damn bitch! There's no reason to be sad or hurt. It's natural for relationships to end. They're famous lines. So, bury the memories in your heart, and forget the bus that left! Nice! I won 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 points! Stop! Give me your hand! Come on! Here! Ow! Penance is a given with human beings. You have to repent to truly mature. Is love a crime? Why repent it? Don't you watch the news? Bastards who do date rape claim it was love. According to your logic, why should they go to jail? That's an obsession and clearly a crime. Why compare this to that? - This is different! - No, it's not! It is! What a stubborn kid! Do whatever you want! And wear sunglasses when you look at me. It makes me uncomfortable. "Days of Being Wild"! - Like this movie? - It's great! This is my favorite scene. Me too. He's like me. Right. I'm talking about his backside. People who've been rejected all look like that. Got any drinks? You said you won't drink. Do I keep going? Okay, cut! Wow! You look the same! No way! It's not the same. I look better. - No! Move! - Shoot! Goal! - Goal! Goal! - Happy? Like winning that much? Goal! Look! It was awesome! Get off me. Sorry. Ulsanbawi Rock was a rock, huh? Yes, it was. I can't take this anymore. You're being so childish! You pout and pick on everything I say! Isn't it about time you get over it? Well, maybe you should stop talking about Kim Hyun! I didn't bring him up today! You trembled and went crazy when I said that he's dating! Crazy? I was trembling because I'm damn tired! Look ahead! I felt like I was in boot camp training! Look ahead! So you're tired to be with me? This vacation felt like boot camp? Just forget it! Stop the car. Stop! I'm at Neuratjae Tunnel heading west. I'm 400M from Neuratjae Tunnel. Excuse me. Where are you going? The insurance company will send someone here soon. So? They'll record details of all passengers. Your insurance broker knows you're Kim Hyun's friend. I introduced her to you. What would she think if she learns we were together out here? Who cares? You divorced 10 years ago! - It doesn't matter! - Really? Can you tell your friends and employees everything? That you're dating Kim Hyun's ex-wife? We can pretend, but this is our reality. Listen. I get it now. I'll tell everyone. What can you do? Come on! Honey! Yu Jin! Wait! Stop! Listen. He's different from us. I don't want you to get hurt. I don't expect anything, so how can I get hurt? Bye, sir. Hop on. Professor! I told you not to look at me like that. Crazy... - Yu Jin! Got a razor? - Of course. My dad ran a barbershop. I learned from watching him while playing at the shop. I like the feel of the blade rather than a machine. Does your father know? Yes, so we don't see each other. Whose idea was that? My dad's. Still, you should go. He'll be waiting for you. I'll go when the book is out. It could take a while. Parents always worry about their children. He may not understand, but I'm sure he misses you. You miss him too, right? If you talk, you could get hurt. Please record your message after the beep. Honey? Did you block my number? Please... I don't know if you'll get this message. It's all my fault. I'm outside your house. Please take my calls. Are you coming for dinner? You eat first. I need to mark some reports. - Come quickly. - Whatever. Huh? What? - What the hell? Who are you? - Who do you think? What? Baby! Honey! WELCOME, AUTHOR YU JIN! Who is it? If you called, I would've gone to get it. I had to come to Seoul anyway. Yu Jin. Guys like us should stick to each other. I'll be good. Come back to me. If you keep doing this, I'll feel even worse, sir. How can you do this to me? All because a trashy novel... Why not me? Why him but not me? He's doesn't write cheap emotional sentiments. Why didn't you throw stuff out? I'll clean. Leave it. YU JIN Yu Jin? Who's that? A student of mine. Why would a female student call you at this hour? He's a guy. Give it to me! Hello? Hello? You were right. - Hello? - Professor? Professor? Ah, my wife came back. Let's exchange what we write by email for now. Hello? - Sure, I understand. - Okay, bye. GOODNIGHT, FRIEND Hello, son. Your teacher called. Your appendix burst again? PARK MI-AE - Hi, Mi-ae! - Kim Hyun! Isn't this Kim Hyun's phone? That's right! It's Hae-jin. How've you been? Shut up and put Hyun on. I'm so sorry. He's taking a shower. Please call again next time. Thank you! Don't hang up! Crazy bitch. Hello! Who's calling? Isn't that my phone? How dare you hang up! I'll get you! Take the call. - What's with you? - Are you out of your mind! Hello? - Come here now! - What now? What now? Come now if you don't want to see your son's funeral! I'd better go now. Kim Hyun! Why didn't you call Sung-kyung? I told you to watch him when I was away! It was only for a few days! Excuse me. - Why'd you bring that thing? - Honey, did you hear that? Honey, did you hear that? Call Sung-kyung to your room. What are you doing? I don't want her listening to this. Where'd you go instead of school and tutoring? Tell us before we kill you! Calm down! I won't punish you. Just tell me. It's okay, son. I just want to know what's wrong. It's okay. You can tell me. Cut the act. Just act normal, Dad. You jerk! No more Mr. Nice Guy! How dare you keep acting up! Not going to school? There are things you gotta do in life even if you don't want to! Then why didn't you just try and stick to being married! You two do whatever you want! Why can't I? What do you mean we do whatever we want? You're divorced but still have sex! Turn up the volume! What are you talking about! You said it's like bank interest! - Interest? - Dad said it's like interest! - What's he saying? - You said to talk to him. You compared us to bank interest? Then what? See? I said to leave him alone till things cooled down! It's because you're always so overprotective of him! And you always tell him to study! Raise your daughter like that! Don't lecture me! What do you know about nurturing! Then stop calling me over! I hate this damn family! - What? - Kim Sung-kyung! What did you say? This damn family? Come back here! Why are you here? She opened the door for me. You probably didn't hear the bell. Who says you can unlock my front door! Look at this mess! Didn't you know, Dad? Mom didn't go away on business. She went to Gangwon-do with him. And you. Did you know my parents are having an affair? They're cheating on you people! They had sex in that room! I saw it! Success! Success! Let go! How do you expect me to be normal in this house? This sucks! That's not it! I know you, jerk! How dare you have sex with your ex-wife! You got it all wrong, honey! Let go! It's me! Wrong person. - Ow! It hurts! - Hey! Honey! You son of a bitch! You had nowhere to run away to but your neighbor's house? It suits you. It's yummy! When is your husband coming? Don't know. We don't know each other's schedules. Did he really go away on business? Why? My dad said that and went away to cheat on Mom. I guess life doesn't come easy for me or you. Sounds like author Kim has less creativity in that field. What do I do now? They say love comes unexpectedly. I can't kick him out. Don't you have to be close to hit each other's wrists in games? I don't know. My feelings are growing stronger. You're right. I'll keep meeting him, and be cool in saying goodbye. Are you going to keep living like that? Yes. Why? You can't survive on doing nothing forever. Sloths don't do anything, but aren't extinct yet. Don't say to anyone else, but me. Why not? It makes you look stupid. So cute. Ma'am! Where should we go now? Where are you today? Are you busy now? If you're free, wanna meet me? I have something to tell you I think I love you I've never said this before You're my lady You're my baby I'm not kidding As of today, right now, Will you be my baby? ♫ Of all the ugly guys ♫ ♫ I'm the best looking ♫ ♫ How do I have to do let you know how I feel? ♫ ♫ Thinking of you drives me crazy ♫ ♫ So I'm not that handsome ♫ OPEN MIND You okay? Are you okay? Yup. Me too. I wrote up a rough proposal for you to look at. I think I can get this done before the end of my contract. You couldn't write one page for 7 years... Who is this new writer? You'll see on signing day. That's annoying! Life stings. Eat this, jerk. You're the only one among us who makes a living on writing. You're the only one left. Right... It's so hard to write for a living. I'm fifty, but I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm so lame. Then what does that make me when I sell books off of you? - Am I recycled garbage? - Why you. Don't laugh. - Hey. - What? By the way, I liked Mi-ae first. Be good to her. She deserves to be happy. You bastard... What! Who was that? If you're up, come out. I'll give you two choices to choose from. First. You're so sorry and too ashamed to be with me, you suggest getting divorced. So we get divorced. Second. I can't trust you anymore and propose we get divorced. So we get divorced. Is there a third choice? Yes. Divorce by agreement. Hae-jin... Honey... I won't do it again. I promise! Let's go with the third choice. Don't mind me and go. Honey, I'm so sorry. I heard everything. He said he was drunk. Just go. Huh? I heard you punched him for coming on to you. Just go. I love you, honey. I love you. I love you too... Why'd you block my calls? Is he crying? That hurt. I wanted to die when I thought I lost you. A man who cries is charming, right? Stop looking. He's mine. - Hello, sir! - Hi, professor. Who's absent? The gay guy. Who just said that? The person you are calling... He had terminal liver cancer. I came too late. Don't blame yourself. The last time I saw Dad after coming out, he bought me a book. "Empty Space". Reading it, I realized why he bought it for me. That's when I started liking you. That's like literary admiration. Comfort and empathy can be mistaken for love. Professor... Can you hold me just once? Sure. Come here. Cheer up. I know it's love. Wait. Back off. I know how I feel. But you're... What are you doing? This is your father's funeral! Fuckin' bothers me... Sir? It's time for class. Okay. - Lee Sang-gon. - Here. - Kang Joo-hee. - Yes. - Kim Do-hee. - Here. - Kim Dong-hwan. - Yes. - Yu Jin. - Here! - Lee Sang-eun. - Yes. - Lee Jin-a - Yes. - Cho Yun-bin. - Here. TWO MEN I'm sorry I'm late. Did you send your father off well? Yes. Good. Back then, when I said... The publisher will call soon. The release date is set. You have to sign a contract. Let's wrap it up well. The company will explain your schedule from here on. I'll see you there. You may go. Here. It's all done. We're done, but author Kim Hyun isn't here yet. The old man in the book... the psychological description of loving him is very detailed. By chance... Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? What question? Jeez! You startled me. What? Don't get me wrong. Our company's name is 'Open Mind'. We're open minded here. I'm so touched! For fans of author Kim Hyun who have waited for 7 years, I think this book will be like a great gift. Keep up the good work till the end! Let's drink to that! Cheers! Cheers! What? Oh! Author Yu Jin! I was just about to introduce our newest author, Yu Jin! Don't get me wrong. I suggest you go home tonight. Then you'll have to come to my funeral. They won't kill you, but they'll beat you to death. Go home tonight. ♫ Close your eyes and count to three ♫ Shh! Come closer. ♫ Now open and tell me what you see ♫ Pound, thump. Can you hear my heartbeat? You got me. I feel the same way too. ♫ I'ne never said that before ♫ "I love you Jung-won. May our love last forever"? - What? - Honey! When did you come? What's with you? Jung-won? Who is this? It's nothing. Let's go home. You sure he's nothing? Nothing? Get your hand off her, jerk! Honey! He's a crazy kid! If he bites, you'll get sick. - Let go! - Go home, kid! - Let go! - Go! Let's go home. Young bastard! How old are you? Who are you? - I... I'm... - Go home! - Jung...

But you jerk! - Why'd you do that to Mi-ae... - Okay, okay. - That's wrong... - Taxi! - Thank you! - Crazy... - The cab is here? - Get in. - Wait. - Go home! - Help me! - Go! Damn... Hello? Kim Sung-kyung! - Sir? Are you his father? - Yes. Yes. It's a double assault case. Her husband went to emergency. What? Why did you do that? We asked them why, but they won't speak. I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. But his wife doesn't want your son to be charged. Thank you very much! - It's okay. - Thank you! Please sign the agreement, then take him home. Please don't scold him. He didn't do anything wrong. - No? - Aish! Let's talk. You really didn't like me? Not at all. You're lying! - I heard you talking in your room. - What? You cried and said your feelings for me were growing! Oh, my god. I was practicing for an audition! - You're lying... - Think I'm crazy enough to like a doofus like you? Why am I a doofus? You like sloths, of course you're a doofus! - Let go! - Stop. Let go! - Sung-kyung! - Moon Jung-won! Let go! Jung-won! Come back! Stop! Jung-won! Jung-won! Jung-won! Where are you? Moon Jung-won... Dad! It's too dark! I can't see! What happened? Later. It's okay. It'll get better in time. How can it get better when it hurts so much? My heart feels like it's burning. It hurts so badly. My heart is broken. I think I'm gonna die. Right... It must hurt a lot... TWO MEN WRITTEN BY KIM HYUN & YU JIN MBC REPORTER YTN REPORTER Hello? Open Mind. How can you publish the report without verifying things? Please tell us. Kim Hyun once called a writer's book full of cheap, gay sentiments. He was anti-homosexual. When I saw him living with his co-author Yu Jin, and realized they're in love... Damn it. I saw them. He's saying what he does is okay, but what others do is wrong. Kim Hyun is rumored to be dating Yu Jin, his co-author of "Two Men". They met as a professor and student. Kim's wife and 7-year-old daughter are living in the US. There is a new update on Kim Hyun and Yu Jin. Writer N claimed further revelations on his social media. "Two Men" is actually Yu Jin's book. Kim Hyun suffered mentally from the burden of writing a new book. You bastard. Even if you don't expect anything from him and think you won't get hurt, it's different for him! You're a pain in the neck to him! How long will you stay like this? - What about Yu Jin? - His phone is off and his place is surrounded by reporters. Still, you should go and check. Think it was easy coming here? Our investors and ad sponsors want you to hold a press conference. Whether it's true or not, just say it isn't. It's the only way to save a lot of people. Just say Yu Jin had a crush on you, and you agreed to co-write the book. It's simple. How much is the penalty? Selling this place won't be enough. Money is not the only problem. What are you going to do? Aren't you going to write? Just answer two questions. I'll send you a guide. - Where are you going? - I can't. - Stop! - I can't go that low, man! I'll pay the penalty somehow. I'll take full responsibility. I don't believe this! Hello? Now? Hello, I'm Yu Jin. We also thought much about whether it is appropriate to do a live interview with you. However, you claimed that writer N's claims are false and seemed determined to explain your relationship with Kim Hyun. Let me ask you, Mr. Yu. Are you refuting rumors of romance between yourself and author Kim Hyun? Or that you agreed to co-author to make a debut when it was your book? - Please explain. - It's true that I'm in love with Professor Kim Hyun. I see. However, he doesn't love me. He's different from me. Please continue. Hello? What Mr. Nam Jin said... is not true. "Two Men" was co-written without any coercion or conditions. I'm screwed... Then, I ask you... Since it's a socially sensitive issue, it must be difficult to reveal yourself for the truth like this. I'm fine. I'm... used to getting hurt and overcoming it. Do I keep going? Okay, cut! ROOM FOR RENT - Where are you? - Why? Why? Did you forget about your book concert? I told you I wouldn't do it without Yu Jin. Hyun! Don't do this to me, man. There aren't many people here. Why make a big fuss? I'll ask the next question. What did you want to say through this book? I wanted to talk about relationships. No one should judge or belittle who loves whom. Do I love the one who loves me? Or does the one I love not love me? I wanted to draw out how we grow and change with relationships. Reading Yu Jin's short story, you said it felt like going back to your desperate and unhindered days. Then, would you say your writings back then are similar to Yu Jin's? Not at all. Author Yu Jin writes much better. Yu Jin is a true literary artist. How was your experience writing the book together? You have different views on love. Any difficulties? We fought hard. So I felt happy and thankful to be writing again. Any last words you'd like to say to author Yu Jin? Mixing colors doesn't make them disappear. They just look different. Please continue. But the original colors we knew... What's happening? Moon Ae-ri won the Booker Prize! Damn it! - Hello? - Did you arrive? Yes. Don't come back without writing this time. - If I catch you fishing, you're dead! - Gotcha! As sentences come together to form a book, sad emotions accumulate to fill a life. We suffer fiercely, break up, fight for love, Hi. And comfort each other. They also went through the stinging season. Though some may be young, reckless, and different, the main characters' resplendent, healing wounds fill their chapters in life. Still, I can't pick up my pen. To my friend who is overcoming his pain, I must tell him something to be able to write again. You're not a pain to anyone. You're a comfort to me. Mixing colors doesn't make them disappear. They just look different. But the original colors we knew are still there. That's what you were going to say to me, right? Though it got buried when Moon won the Booker Prize. This place is an independent republic only on April 1st every year, right? You remembered? Then we're citizens of this country. I guess. Here. Thanks. - I love you. - What? What? It's April Fool's Day. I can say anything. Crazy fool.
