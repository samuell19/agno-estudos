- A man's destiny, some say, is written in the stars. All he'll ever do, all he'll ever love, all he'll ever be. The whole of his life is inscribed in the heavens, some say. Others claim to see the truth in other places. In a deck of cards, the palm of a hand, a crystal ball, or the bottom of a cup. Perhaps it's in all of those. Perhaps none of them. For my part, the only glimpses of the future fate ever provided were in men's faces. There I read passion, greed, hatred, envy, and knowing what had been, knew also what had to be. So many faces. Too many. And most of them not very pleasant. The face of Sir Harry Wotton: rich, idle, bored with life. A man who, to use his own words, knew the price of everything, the value of nothing. The face of Basil Hallward: a kind and generous man; a superb painter; as good a friend as I ever knew. So many faces to read the future in, their futures and my own. - Harry, I wasn't expecting you. - Precisely why I'm here. Nobody's heard from you for weeks, Basil. They're wondering what's happened. - Well, you see, I've been quite busy. - I could have guessed that much. A new work! Must be something rather special. - Hey, wait! Don't. - You don't want me to see it? - No, that is, not until it's finished. - [laughing] You're being most mysterious today, Basil. I wonder why. Oh, I say. Why, this is excellent, really excellent. I think it may be the best thing you've ever done. - Yes I-- I feel sure that it is. - [laughing] When it's finished, you must send it to the Grosvenor. Yes, the Grosvenor is the only place. The Academy is so large and vulgar. Whenever I've been there, there were either so many people you couldn't see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures you couldn't see the people, which was worse. - Actually, I don't think I'd send it anywhere. - Not send it anywhere? [laughing] What odd fellows you artists are. You do anything in the world to gain a reputation, and once you have, you seem to want to throw it away. It's very foolish of you. There's only one thing worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. - I really can't exhibit it, Harry. It's hard to say why. I've put so much of myself into it. Something happened to me while painting. Some strange force seemed to be guiding my brush, almost as if I-- I was painting my own soul. - [laughing] - I knew you'd laugh. It's true, all the same. - Who is your subject by the way? Have I met him? - You haven't. - What's his name? - I don't think I'll tell you. - Tell me, why shouldn't you? - For one thing, he wouldn't interest you. He's a very simple, very innocent, young man. - Oh, really? Then perhaps you are right. All the same, there is something about your young friend that fascinates me. Oh, come, you know I can keep a secret. I'm a married man, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary. - I'd rather you didn't know. I don't want you to meet him. Your influence would be bad. - Thank you for the compliment. I know I do like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world. Oh, come, don't be tiresome. Tell me his name. - Mr. Dorian Gray is here, sir. - Ask him to wait in the library. - Very good, sir. - Oh, Parker, just a moment. Some new, young friend. Someone I should know. - You may show Mr. Gray in, Parker. - Yes. - [laughing] What nonsense you do talk, Basil. I expect the young gentleman in question is one of these charming, brainless types. The delight of hostesses in search of a table setting. They're most valuable in the winter, when there are no flowers. - The stars, the cards, the human face. What good does it do to read the future in any of them, if the words cannot be changed? And if they cannot, then only one question remains. Who does the writing? If I knew the answer to that, if I could be sure, then I would know whether to curse God for what my life has been or praise the devil. [soft music playing] - Surely, you must have met Lady Brandon by now. She gives more dinners than anyone else in London. But the food, at least, is excellent. [laughing] Poor dear. She wanted to establish a salon and succeeded only in opening a restaurant. - Yes, I think I met her. She has rather a shrill voice, doesn't she? - She is a peacock in everything but beauty. [laughing] - Please, I'm almost finished. Harry, really, I must beg you, I want to finish at this sitting. Do you mind if I ask you to go away, now? - Of course, if I'm disturbing you, I'll be delighted to leave. That is, if Mr. Gray will excuse me. No, no I won't. You must stay and talk, Mr. Harry. Basil, you don't really mind, do you? You've often told me, you like your subjects to have someone to chat to. Sir Harry has been telling me about some friends of his in the theater. - Sir Harry is an evil influence. Pay him no mind. - Is it true, Sir Harry? - What? - That you're an evil influence. - Of course. All influences are evil, Mr. Gray. - Why do you say that? - Because to influence someone is to change their true course in life. You become the echo of somebody else's music. An actor in a part that was written for somebody else. The aim of life is self-development, to realize one's own nature, perfectly. The highest of all duties is the duty we owe ourself. - Surely, there's something higher. Ethics. Morality. - No, only terror. The terror of society, which is the basis of morality, and the terror of God, which is the secret of religion. It takes courage, Mr. Gray, to realize one's own nature fully and completely. The bravest man among us is afraid of himself, of his desires. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse we strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. You, Mr. Gray, you, yourself, have had passions that made you afraid. Thoughts that have filled you with terror; daydreams and dreams of sleep, the very memory of which can make you tremble. - There, at last, finished. All that bit of the background, I can work that up later. Thank you, Dorian. More than I can say, I don't know what Harry's been telling you, but it must have been interesting. You haven't moved. - Oh, I was simply explaining to Mr. Gray that the easiest way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. - You know you don't mean that. Well, the value of an idea has nothing to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. - You are glad you've met me, Mr. Gray? - Yes. I'm glad I've met you. I wonder shall I always be glad? - Now, what's this? Not in bed yet. My, my. It's after 6 o'clock already. Now, what? - I want to see Dori. - Very well, you may tell your Uncle Dori good night. - I say, you have been busy of late. When did this happen? - Ah, Beatrice, poor child. She's my younger brother's daughter. He and his wife were touring the continent last summer. An inn where they were staying burnt during the night. - Oh, I am sorry Basil. I hadn't heard. - Yes, she's come here to stay with me, and hope she'll be happy. She loves Dorian, of course. - How could she help it? - Your promise, now? - I won't forget. - You must wait until I'm all grown up, and then we shall be married. - [laughing] It appears you are spoken for. - It does, doesn't it? - Now, come along. You must get your sleep if you are going to grow up quick and marry Dorian. You haven't looked at your picture yet. Don't you want to? - Oh yes, is it really finished? - Well? - Do I look like that? - Hmm. Let me tuck Beatrice in and then we'll have a drink. Say good night, dear. - Good night, Dori. - One would think that you had never seen yourself before, Mr. Gray. - I feel as though I never have. - The gods have been good to you. They've given you youth and beauty, the only things worth having. The world belongs to you for a season. Unhappily, what the gods give, they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live fully and completely. And when youth is gone, you will find that you have no triumphs left. Time is jealous of you. Time will have its revenge. Each month, as it wanes, brings you closer to something dreadful. Our limbs fail, our senses decay, we degenerate into hideous puppets haunted by memories. The memory of passions we were afraid to gratify, of temptations we hadn't the courage to yield to. Youth, Dorian. There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth. - Here. Shall we have a whisky? I think we've earned it. And you do like it? Good, I'm glad. Most of the credit is yours, you know. You're the best subject I've ever had. You don't like it? - Well, of course, he likes it. Why shouldn't he? He's a very lucky young fellow. - How sad. - What? What do you mean? - How sad it is. I shall grow old, but this picture will remain always young. My hair will turn gray, my skin will wrinkle, and my teeth will rot. While my picture remains exactly as it is, now. If only it were the other way. Truly, if it were I who would remain always young, and the picture would grow old. For that, I would give everything. - Dorian. - Yes, everything. For that, I would even give my soul. - To long life. - For days, after that fateful meeting at Basil's studio, Sir Harry's words seemed to ring in my mind. The aim of life is to realize one's nature perfectly. But what did that mean? What was my nature? How could I find out? One thing I did understand, time is jealous, Harry had said, and what the gods give, they quickly take away. - Lord Wotton is here, sir. - Ah, good. - Are you going to be late again this evening, sir? - I do hope so, Victor. Oh, don't scowl, sir. I should be in excellent company, the very best. [classical music playing] - I had begun spending as much time as possible with Harry. He introduced me into the best homes in London. Of course, my family name and income assured my welcome in such places. But only Harry's sponsorship could have gained me such quick acceptance. - Didn't I see you and Harry at the opera, Mr. Gray? "Lohengrin," I think it was. Oh, I love Wagner. He's so loud, one could talk the whole time. - Harry's world was by no means limited to expensive homes and exclusive clubs. As well known as he was among the elite, he was equally welcome in places the elite hardly knew existed. Only a few special friends were privileged to go with Harry to these places. [classical music playing] - 17, place your bets on 12. All bets down. All bets down. - Dorian, six, the winner. Six, the winner. - I found that I had more than mere ability to participate in such pleasures. I shared my companion's taste for them. It was only a little while until such excitements became natural to me, and a necessary part of my life. [horse steps] [upbeat music] - Harry, love! Where have you been? Now, you must order me champagne or I shall be angry with you for staying away so long. - You see, gentlemen? Women treat us exactly the way humanity treats its gods. They worship us, but they're always asking us to do things for them. Oh, all right, champagne shall it be. Or what passes for champagne at this establishment. - I say, you girl, two bottles of champagne. - Who's this, eh, love? - I say, did you hear me? - Sir? - I said, bring two-- - Ah, yes, sir, champagne. - Just a minute, my girl. I haven't seen you here before. New, aren't you? I thought so. - Please, sir, my wrist. - What's your name? - Hey, you're hurting her. - Shut up. I asked you your name. - It's Sibyl, sir. - Let her go. - Sibyl, what? - I said, let her go. - When I'm ready. - Dorian, stop it! - You'll answer for that. - At your pleasure. - Be silent, both of you. I can stand sordid behavior and sordid surroundings but not both. I will not have friends of mine quarreling over a bar maid. Now, let's hear no more about this. Dorian, sit down. - Excuse me. - Dorian? - He seems taken by the wench. Who would've believed it? I thought our Dorian was far too sensible. - Oh, the contrary. He's far too wise not to do foolish things every now and then. [upbeat music playing] - Yes, yes. That's fine, thank you. - Can't understand. He knew we were coming. It's not like Dorian to forget. - Dorian isn't much like Dorian these days, haven't you noticed? - No, but of course I haven't seen much of him recently. - Nor has anybody else except for a certain young woman. - Really? Are you under the impression that he's in love? - Oh no, but he is. He's even mentioned marriage. - Who's the girl? Do I know her? - I shouldn't think so. It's unlikely you would have visited the place she works at. - Works? - As a bar maid. - Impossible. - But quite true. - I don't believe it. Think of Dorian's birth, his position. It would be absurd for him to marry so far beneath him. - If you want to make absolutely certain that he does, just tell him that. Whenever a person does something thoroughly foolish, you can be sure it's from noble motives. Or, of course, marriage would be silly. But there are other, more interesting bonds between men and women. I should certainly encourage those. - Harry! - Basil, I'm sorry I'm late, but if you knew where I'd been, and who I was with, you'd forgive me. - Now then, I suppose you must be forgiven. - You know? You can guess. Then you must know too. Has Harry told you? - He mentioned a girl. - So much more than that! An angel, say, or a princess, only she has more youth and beauty than either. She's going to be an actress. She has the most wonderful voice. She did Juliet for me the other day, and her voice was like-- like-- a distant flute. It had the tremulous ecstasy one hears just before dawn, when the nightingales are singing. - Harry, why did you never tell me the only thing worth loving is an actress? - Perhaps because I have loved so many of them. - Now, you're laughing at me. But the greatest romance of my life-- - [laughing] No, no. I'm not. But you shouldn't say, "the greatest romance of your life." You should say, "the first." You will always be loved. This is only the beginning. - What? You think me so shallow? - Oh, on the contrary. It's people who love only once that I call shallow. What they call faithfulness, I prefer to call either lethargy or lack of imagination. - That's rubbish, Harry. - I must analyze faithfulness one day. I think it has to do with our passion for property. There are so many things we wouldn't throw away if we weren't so afraid other people would pick them up. - And I have no time for such nonsense. I just stopped to see my painting hung. - The painting. Basil, I'm a selfish ass. You give me your finest piece of work, come in person to see it hung properly and all I can do is talk about myself. I'm sorry. - I understand. - It's a wonderful picture. I'm deeply grateful. - Then I'm glad. I hope that you and your young lady will be very happy. - Oh, you must meet her. - I look forward to it. Goodbye, Harry. [laughing] - What are you smiling at? I wish I'd never told you about Sibyl Vane. It's obvious you don't understand. - Dorian, you couldn't help telling me. All through your life, you will tell me everything you do. - Yes. You have a curious influence over me. If ever I were to do a crime, I would come and confess it to you. You would understand me. - People like you don't commit crimes, Dorian, though I am much obliged for the compliment. Now, tell me, what are your actual relations with Sibyl Vane? Now, if you tell me that you haven't made love to her yet, I will be really confused. - Are you suggesting-- - Oh, Dorian, stop it. You know perfectly well what you want from this girl. Why not admit it? And once you've succeeded with her, I wager you'll find her a terrible bore. - You're wrong, Harry. She isn't what she seems. You only think these things because of where you first saw her. She belongs to an entirely different world to that. - Oh, really? And you? What world do you belong to, Dorian? Because you're quite right, you know. There are two. When I first met you, you knew only the world of polite illusion, charm, elegance, chivalry. I have shown you another world. Not so pretty perhaps, but far more real. I think you prefer it. And so, I'll wager, does miss Sibyl Vane. - No. - Really? The next time you see your Juliet, ask her to come home with you. And if she refuses, threaten never to see her again. - I didn't know till now just how cynical you could be, Harry. - Oh, don't worry. She won't refuse. - She won't have to. This is one relationship I have no intention of degrading. - Of course not. Curious, isn't it? In love, we begin by deceiving ourselves and end by deceiving others. Fin de siecle! Oh, and don't forget, we're dining with the van Deleur's Thursday night. [peaceful music playing] - No, Dorian, please don't. - Why not? - You mustn't. Truly. - My, look at the sun. It's getting late. I fancy we must start back soon. Oh, Dorian, why don't you come have supper with us? Mum's ever so keen to meet you. - Suppose I asked you to come with me instead? - Come with you, where? - To my house, to stay the night. Well, why not? We love each other, don't we? At least, you say you do. And if you do, well...? Do you find me repulsive? - Why are doing this, Dorian? Why? - Because I have the right. We're going to be married, aren't we? Or are we? If we are, your answer should be simple. You'll come to my house tonight, not later than 10 o'clock. [ominous music playing] This was wrong and I knew it. I should have gone back to her and apologized. I nearly did. Then I remembered the things that Harry had said and decided to wait, a few hours at any rate, until 10 o'clock. The hour came and passed. I admit to having felt disappointment, regret for what might have been. On the other hand, Sir Harry had proved wrong for once. For once, my judgment, my instinct was vindicated. Tomorrow I tell him so. It would be some consolation. And, of course, I would go to Sibyl and explain, throw myself at her feet, if necessary, and beg for forgiveness. She'd have to forgive me. It was all Harry's fault. I could see that now, and I would tell him so, frankly. As a matter of fact, I would tell him so, now. It was early yet, he'd still be at the club, most likely. There was no reason to wait. [knocking at door] [eerie music playing] - I love you, Dorian. [eerie music playing] - Sibyl. [upbeat music playing] - Everyone I know says you are very wicked towards women. - [laughing] Oh, it's outrageous, the way people insist on saying things behind one's back that are absolutely true. - You needn't worry. Women love men to have their defects. If a man has enough of them, we can positively worship him. - The man, on the other hand, could be happy with any woman, so long as he doesn't love her. - Oh, for shame, Lord Wotton. Women give man the very gold of their lives. - And invariably want it back in such very small change. - Do you know her? - She is beautiful. - And dangerous. - Intriguing. - How is Miss Vane? - Well, I suppose. - Don't you know? - The fact is I haven't seen her for several days. A few weeks, actually. - A few weeks? - Now, don't you chide me. I get enough of that from her. She writes every day. She can't seem to understand, I've been very busy of late. - I don't think that I do. You speak so coldly of her now. I suppose this is, uh, more of Harry's doing. - I owe Harry a lot. I've developed because of him. New thoughts, new feelings, new interests. - And are these things good, Dorian? - They're real. Our lives are too short to waste. Why not fill them with beauty? Except happiness is the truest form of good. - And are you happy? - Ah, there you are. Hello, Basil. Someone wants to meet you, dear fellow. Can you spare a moment? - Who is it? - Uh, you will, uh, excuse us, won't you? Come along, I'll introduce you. Here we are. Forgive me if I don't join you. [door closes] - Forgive me for taking you away from your friends. I only wanted to say good night. - So early? - I'm afraid so. I find large groups fatiguing. - In that case, you're wise to retire. - Do you think so? - Oh, definitely. - You're very sympathetic. I thought you would be. From the moment I saw you, I thought, here is someone who will understand. Someone kind, someone gentle. [knocking on door] - Oh, uh, good morning, miss. - Is-- is he, uh-- - I'm sorry, miss. - I'm sorry to keep bothering you this way. He still hasn't returned? Would you give him this when you see him? - Why certainly, miss. - It's the last. I won't bother you again. - Victor. Victor! - Dorian! - Oh. You must forgive me. I've just returned, um, last night, in fact. I'd ask you in, only-- I'm afraid everything is... Sibyl? [door closes] Damn. Victor! Bring me some coffee, will you? - Yes. - And Victor, if the young lady should return, I am not at home. - She's come so often-- - I am still not here! - Very good, sir. The lady left this for you, sir. - Oh, God. Why did she have to pursue me? Couldn't she understand that things weren't the same? I was still fond of her, of course! Grateful. Why couldn't she accept that? Why instead did she continue to plague me, continue to make demands on me? She would end by forcing me to hate her. Couldn't she understand there was more to my world now than the love of a bar maid? The picture... There was something strange about the picture. It seemed... different. - Your coffee, sir. [ominous music playing] - Will there be anything else, sir? - No. No, you can go now. Oh, go! Had he seen? Was there anything to see? Was it my imagination, or had it really changed? It couldn't have. No, perhaps there was some impurity in the paint, a flaw in the canvas. If so, why did only the mouth seem changed? Only the twist of lips that lent cruelty to the face. Had it been there before? There had to be some explanation. I'd ask Basil of it. I'd have him come and look. But not tonight. Tonight I would go and see Sibyl. Since it meant so much to her, I'd grant her request. It would have been cruel not to. Ah, no! Tonight I was to meet Harry at the opera. I'd promised! He was bringing someone special. Tomorrow, then. I would see Sibyl without fail tomorrow. Victor, draw my bath and put out my dinner jacket. I'll be going out this evening. - My dearest one, I don't know what I've done, what ignorant or foolish thing I may have said to hurt you, but I didn't mean it. You know I'd never do anything to make you sad. Please, tell me how to make it up to you. I will make it up, I promise. Even if it takes a lifetime For I've promised to spend all my life loving you. You must come tonight. I'll wait where we used to meet. Please, don't fail me this time. In heaven's name, don't. I can't bear not hearing from you anymore, not seeing your dear face, not knowing what you want of me, or even if you do anymore. [ominous music playing] [upbeat music playing] - Dorian, open the door. [knocking on door] It's no good shoving yourself away like this. Do you hear me? - What the devil is the matter? Come in. - I came as soon as I could. I'm terribly sorry, old man. But you mustn't blame yourself. - Blame myself? - For the girl. Sibyl. - What about her? - Oh, you haven't heard yet. - Harry, what is it? Nothing's happened to her? Oh God, no, Harry. - Now, now, steady. I thought you would have heard. It was in the morning papers. - She-- she-- - She drowned. - It wasn't an accident. No. So I have murdered Sibyl Vane. - Oh, nonsense. It wasn't your fault at all. - You don't know, Harry. You don't know what I did to her. I murdered her, as surely as if I had used a knife. And yet, I loved her once. She was everything to me. Oh God, Harry, what shall I do? You don't know the danger I'm in. Why did she do this to me? She had no right. - Dorian, it's futile to dwell on it. You'll only do yourself harm, and the girl no good. There'll be an inquest, I'm afraid. Do her people know you? The family? - I never met her mother. Her brother lives in Australia. - Oh good, then with any luck you'll be able to keep out of it. Let's hope so. It's quite all right to debut you with a scandal in Paris, but not in London. The best thing for you to do is to come and have dinner with me, tonight. It'll keep your mind occupied. - Not tonight. - Oh, well, if you should change your mind, I'll be at the club. Goodbye, Dorian. [ominous music playing] [deep brass horns playing] - No, no, no. [suspenseful music playing] [deep brass horns playing] There was no longer any doubt. The picture was changing. How or why, I didn't know. But the lines around its mouth and eyes had grown deeper, crueler, as though it knew of Sibyl's death and was accusing me. Me! It wasn't true, I hadn't killed her. This way. [ominous music playing] In here. Anywhere. [footsteps] Careful. Very good. My man will pay you. If only it were the other way, if it were I who would remain always young, and the picture would grow old. For that, I would even give my soul. Impossible. Could it be? Could those few careless words have anything to do with what has happened? No! I would not believe it... and yet, if this thing is true, it means that for every year I live, the picture will age. For every sin I commit, it will change, not I. For a moment, I had an urge to pray, to ask that whatever bond there was between it and me would be broken. But this need not be a bad thing. The picture could be my conscience. As a matter of fact, it would be interesting to observe the changes in it. If those harsh lines in the face reproached me for my thoughtlessness with Sibyl, then why could I not erase them with some better action? I resolved to do so. It would help me to lead a better life, guide me in my decisions, my relationships with others. [waltz music playing] It had been some time since I had placed the picture in the nursery, and I had not once troubled to look at it. After all, I saw no reason to. Not that I feared what might have happened with the painting. I didn't. Of course, I was aware that my actions were less than perfect. But after all, they differ little from my contemporaries. But at last I knew that that time had finally come. I could no longer carry this pathetic self-deception any further. Night after night, I had forced myself to play this maddening game. But on this night, I knew it must end. I could not walk by that door one more time. [suspenseful music playing] No. Liar. Liar! I would look at it no more. I would not allow it to rebuke me. Let it rot behind lock and key. I would never look at it again! [cheerful music playing] Why should I? I discovered the meaning of true freedom, the sort Harry talked about. I was free from the ravages of age and decay, free to search out new adventure and new sensations. Why not enjoy them? [laughter] - Where's Harry? - I'm by myself. Harry has told me a lot about you. He's explained certain things about your daughter. - Yeah, that's nothin' to you. - But I'm interested in such things. - Get off! - You see, I only want to help. - Harry shouldn't have told you. All right. [cheerful music playing] - Marianne. Marianne, I brought someone. A friend. [cheerful music playing] [ominous music playing] - Victor. Victor! I'd forgotten. Of course Victor wasn't here any more. I'd had to let him go. I was sorry, because he'd served my family for many years. But there'd be no choice. Victor had known too much. He'd known there was something in the nursery. Suppose some night while I was away, he decided to find out what. I couldn't risk that. I could trust no one in the house alone now. [keys rattling] What are you doing? - Sir? - I told you that room was not to be disturbed! - Yes, sir, I remember now. - Get your things and get out! - But, sir-- - Get out! Your money and references will be sent. Go! - Yes. - No one. I could trust no one. It had been two years since I last dared look upon the thing beyond that door, yet I knew too well what it must look like. Features seared by every evil passion, the dry and desiccated lines of a face scarred by every emotion but pity. Would it be as terrible as I feared? or less awful than I dared believe? As always, since that night, when I had finally locked it away, I was torn. Torn between a sense of scorn for the damned unnatural thing and the ceaseless desire to know, to see, to read from the page of my own degradation. [knocking at door] - Yes, what is it? Basil, come in. - I won't keep you long. I'll be leaving for Paris within the hour. I thought it important that I talk to you, first. Thank you. - To Paris, you say? On business? - Yes, I intend to take a studio there, work on a painting I've had in mind. - Can I offer you a drink? A whiskey? Some sherry? - No, no. Nothing, thanks. I may be gone for quite some time. I'm not sure for how long. I've sent Beatrice to visit her aunt in Canada. - How is she? Beatrice? - She seems well. Of course, a seven-year-old girl is a bit of a mystery for an old bachelor like me. - I imagine. - She still asks about you sometimes. It's been almost two years since you last came to visit. - So long? I hadn't realized. - Well, that isn't why I came. - Why did you? - Because I thought you ought to know that people have begun to say some dreadful things about you. Dreadful. - Don't tell me them. I love to hear scandal about other people but my own lacks the charm of novelty. - I'm serious, Dorian. Of course, I have only to look at you to know that it can't possibly be true. Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man's face. It cannot be concealed. Dorian, you must remember that a man's good name is the most important thing he has. - Is it? - I don't want you to destroy yours and that's what you are doing. For example, could you possibly tell me why it is that Henry Ashton found it necessary to leave England so suddenly last year? Or why it is that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves the room of a club whenever you enter it? Or why Adrian Singleton-- - Enough! You are talking of things you do not understand. - Dorian, I want to understand. I want to be able to defend you, but I can't look into your soul. - Would you like to? - What? - See my soul. After all, why not? You've had more to do with the matter than anyone. You have a right to see the result. - What do you mean? - Merely that I keep a diary of my life, from day to day. A different kind of diary. It never leaves the room in which it's written. Come, I'll show it to you. In here. This will only take a minute. You'll be able to read the whole matter more quickly than you think. Here Is the face of my soul. [loud brass horns playing] - Good Lord. That's my painting of you. What have you done to it? You've destroyed it. - Have you any idea what my life has been since you painted that foul thing? See how it mocks me, how it reproaches me. The sight turns me sick. Even locked away in this room, it haunts me. I know it watches me. It knows what I've done, what I'm doing, and it's vile features alter with every sin I commit, every pain I inflict. It even knows my plans. I've seen it change in response to deeds not yet done, yet it knows. - It's not possible. And yet, if what you say is true, there's no help for you. You're not even human anymore. - You're what? Tell me, Basil. - You're a monster. - You say that. You, who painted the accursed thing. You created it, it's your fault. Look what you've done to me! [yelling] [eerie music playing] Why had I done it? What had possessed me? Why had I killed the one man who wished me well? I was alone now. Totally alone. No! Oh, God, no! [ominous music playing] [footsteps] Be quiet, you idiots. I can remember the panic I'd felt at first. The sheer horror of what I had done. At moments, I wondered if all this was a nightmare, one from which I'd wake. Other moments, I wondered if I'd gone mad. Hurry up! You mustn't be seen. It had taken all the nerve I possess to do what had to be done. Fortunately, I'd known where to find men for such a job. Men whose lives were so empty and miserable, that the life of another meant nothing. Meant less, at least, than the money I gave them to dispose of poor Basil. Men like those were safe. They were too fearful of their own safety to expose anyone else. With Basil gone, it was as though an enormous burden had been lifted from me. I was safe. The one link to my past and to the picture was broken. I was alone now, as few men are alone. And free as no man before me had ever been, free to live completely. The years passed, and as they did I held my life close to the flame of experience and was not burned. Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Gray. And you, Sir Harry, your presence always adds to the occasion. - A delightful evening, Lady Narborough. - You must come and take tea with me soon. Will you promise? - Of course. Good night. - Good night. Good night, Sir Harry. - Charming woman. One sees in her the remains of a truly remarkable homeliness. - That's hardly a sin. - Oh, on the contrary, it's one of the seven deadly virtues. I presume you are going out to the club, would you be so good as to drop me at home on your way? - Certainly. - I would come with you but I'm feeling a bit tired. - [sighing] I wish I knew your secret. - What? - How you've kept your youth. I think I'd do anything to look as well as you do... except to exercise, diet, and keep respectable hours. It's extraordinary, really. I'm not that many years older than you and yet you don't seem to have changed at all. - I've changed a great deal, I'm afraid. - Not in your appearance. You still remind me of when I first met you at Basil Hallward's. What was that, nearly 20 years ago? Strange. - What is? - Oh, about Basil's disappearance. Did you hear anything more about that? - No. - I had heard a rumor that he'd been seen in San Francisco. Of course, they say that about anyone who has disappeared. Must be the most delightful place, with all the attractions of the next world. - Let's not talk about it, Basil, it depresses me. - Sorry. I only thought of it because I hear that his niece has just returned. What was her name? - Beatrice. - Oh, yes, that's it. She's been living with relatives in Canada. - Why is she here? - Well, she comes into Basil's fortune on her 25th birthday. It's considerable, I think. - Where did you hear all this? - From Lady Wotton. They met somewhere and told each other all they knew over tea. - Does she intend to stay? - My dear boy, how on earth should I know? I presume you could ask her yourself. She seems most anxious to be meet you. - No. - Why on earth not? She was very fond of you as a child, I believe. - I don't want to see her. I can't. I don't want to be reminded of all that. - It's entirely up to you. Lady Wotton had planned a luncheon. I'll tell her to cancel it, naturally. Good night, Dorian. - This hour? No, sir, it's too far for me. - There's twice that much for you if we're there within the hour. - You know what place this is, sir? I mean, where it's at? - I know. - You'll be there in an hour. - Hurry up, do you hear? In all the years since it had happened, the memory of Basil's death still haunted me. Sometimes at night, or even awake, I'd seem to hear his final blood-choked cry. And then I'd remember. I'd remember the hideous thing, hidden behind locked doors in my home. The picture, a magical mirror of my soul. In remembering, dread would rise in me like a sickness. A fear that might been of death but it seemed equally a horror of what my life had been. At such times, I was driven back to the sinkholes of the city, to the only recesses where there were shadows deep enough to hide me from myself. [upbeat music playing] Here I sought not a cure for my malady, merely a few hours of oblivion. - Dorian. Dorian. - You. - They told me you was here. Your friend's inside. Something the matter. You better come. - Go away. - But he's your friend. - Friend? - He's sick or something. I don't know. - Where is he? - Come on. [upbeat music playing] [heavy breathing] - Alan. Fetch me some water. Alan, what's the matter? - This? - Yes. You. - Fetch us a hand, sir, and have it ready at the door. - He owes me a guinea. - Get us a cab! Can you stand? - Leave me alone, Gray. - I'll help you. [upbeat music playing] - Here, how about guinea? You promised. Damn you, Dorian! You dirty cheat. I hope you rot, you hear me? - What did you call him? His name, say it! - Dorian! What's it mean to you? - Dorian, it was? Not many with that name. - Steady, mate. Move too quick and your throat's cut. That's it. Easy. Don't worry, you've got time to make your peace with God. I'd give a dog that much. - What do you want, my pocket book? Take it. - No, I'll take your life. - Who are you? - Vane, James Vane, brother of the girl you killed. Oh, you remember now, don't you? - Let go! - No, I've waited too long for this. I was in Australia when she died. I didn't hear how it happened until I got back. And then I begun looking for you. - How long? - All I heard was your first name but it was enough. I knew you come to places like this. I knew that, sooner or later-- - How long since she died? - You know the answer. - Tell me! - 18 years, and I'd have waited twice as long-- - Look at my face! - I've no need to look at-- - Look at me! Am I the man? Could I have known your sister 18 years ago? - Oh, my God... And I almost... [knife hitting floor] God help me. - You fool. You meant to kill me. - I didn't know. I'm sorry. It's just that I've searched so long-- - Let this be a warning to you. You, cab! - I was watching you. Why didn't you kill him? He's got lots of money, and he's bad as bad. - I don't want money. I want a man's blood... but not his. The man I'm looking for must be 40 now, maybe older. - And how old do you think he is, eh? - Him? Not more than his 20s. [laughing] - Well, I seen him. Here, stop it! Now, what are you laughing at? What do you know about this? - I'll tell you. I'll tell you about your sister, if you are the man you say you are. And about a lad who looked the same 20 years ago as he does now. How about a drink, eh? Come on. - Ah, there you are, dear boy. Do come in. - Good afternoon, Lady Narborough. I'm not late, I hope. - You are but I forgive you. Fortunately, I've had delightful company while waiting. Mr. Gray, may I introduce miss Beatrice Harwood? Miss Harwood, Mr. Dorian Gray. - Mr. Gray and I have met. - Have you? - I shouldn't blame him for not wanting to admit it. We were quite shameless. I used to sit on his lap. He used to tell-- - Mr. Gray! Dorian. Dorian, are you all right? - Yes, yes, of course. I'm afraid I've broken something. - You are as white as a ghost. Come, come sit down. - It's nothing. - Oh. - I do hope I haven't offended you. - No, of course not. I felt lightheaded. I'm quite all right. - Here, have some tea. Did you lunch today? I thought not. Now, where is that foolish girl with our scones? - Oh, I'm-- - No, no. You both sit here. I'll fetch her. - Thank you. - Do you feel better? - Yes. - I thought for a moment-- - What? - You seemed so shocked to see me, I thought you might be afraid I'd come to hold you to your promise... To marry me. - Oh. - It's quite all right, really. I release you. - Thank you. - It isn't easy. I remember you as a cross between Saint George, Sir Lancelot, and Prince Charming. And you don't seem to have changed at all. You look exactly as I remember you. I'm afraid I must have been a great bother to you. - You weren't. Are you staying in London? - I rather plan to. I'll have the house redone, in any case. If I don't stay, I can always sell it. - Yes, it was a good house. - I'm leaving the studio as it was, but it's such fun fixing up the rest. Refurnishing, repainting, replacing some of those awful old fixtures with new ones. You must come and see it when it's done, of course. I shall have an enormous house warming and invite all of London. You will come, won't you? - Yes. Yes, of course. In the meantime... I'd be honored if you would dine with me. - I fail to see the problem. If she finds you attractive, and you are attracted to her, what could be simpler? - You don't understand. She was raised different, and she's very vulnerable. A woman in some ways, a child in others. - My dear boy, I've seen this child of yours. - Scoff if you like, but I'm determined not to do anything that would hurt her. - [laughing] Nothing is less permanent than the wounds of love. I had an impassioned affair once, all one season. Years later, I found myself next to the woman in question at dinner. She insisted on going over the whole episode, assuring me that I had ruined her life. I'm bound to report she ate a simply enormous meal while telling me. - I don't find that amusing, Harry. Your cynicism isn't always in the best of taste. - No. Nor is going about like a revivalist, condemning all the sins of which you've grown tired. Might I have my things? - I didn't mean it that way. I merely meant that if there were to be anything between Beatrice Hallward and myself, I think it would change me. It would change my way of life. - In anticipation of which, you are unable to accompany me to the theater tonight to meet two extremely appealing young people. - But tonight I have-- - Other plans. You told me. Oh, love must have its season. Fly to your Beatrice. But I'll save one of my young friends for you, just in case. - Put out my dinner clothes, Hubble. After that, you may go. - Oh, how heavenly! It's laburnum, isn't it? I haven't smelled them since I was little. Everything seems to be coming back to me now. Everything I remember having loved. - Beatrice. - What is it? Have I done something? - You? Of course not. It's just there are things I haven't told you about myself, is all. - I know, you're very bad. Dreadful, in fact. You have the most awful influence on anyone who comes near you. From the moment I arrived in London, people practically stood in line to warn me about you, to hint at what they thought you'd done, or what you might have been, or just possibly would know about, which seems to be almost everything. - You don't believe them? - How could I? I know you. - But you don't. - Better than you know yourself. - What is it? - They were right. Whatever they told you, whatever anyone said about me, no matter how shocking, the truth. - How can you say such things? Do you really think me so weak and foolish? Do you think I don't know how it would be for a man like you? Do you think I know nothing of-- of jealousies, and pettiness, and the sort of things that envious people might say? I do. [insects chirping] - Nothing you've done, nothing you've been, nothing that happened before can ever matter now. All that belongs to two other people, the people we were. - You are sure? - Dorian, darling. I've waited for you for as much of my life as I can remember. Everything that matters begins from this day. The past can't touch us now. [ominous music playing] - Evening to you, Mr. Dorian Gray. Didn't expect to see me again, did you? Shut your gob! Any talking's to be done, I'm the one to do it. Inside. This is better. No one to disturb us here. - You seem to forget the servants. - The old man comes in the morning and leaves at night. There's no one else. That's right, I know quite a bit about you now. Sit down! Finding out wasn't hard, not after I ran into some old friends of yours. If even half what they say about you is true, you're quite a lad, you are. - You've been to a lot of trouble, it seems, just to kill me. - Killing's easy. I can do that anytime. - Meanwhile, there may be a bit of profit in what you've learned. Blackmail? Is that what you're thinking? - Why not? Haven't I spent my time looking for you? Lost my chances to get on a bit. Why shouldn't I have some of it back from you, I'd like to know. - Why should I pay you? If you know much about me, you know that nothing can make my reputation worse than it already is. - People don't know everything. They don't know about you and my sister. - Your sister! If only Sibyl were the worst thing I had on my conscience, a girl that killed herself for love of me. In a way, I suppose it is the worst. But not for your purposes. Put that thing down while I get us a drink. - How about that fancy lady you're engaged to get married to? Does she know everything about you, too? - As a matter of fact, she does. - Well, that don't seem hardly possible, do it? Nice lady like her. Maybe she only thinks she knows. Wonder how she'd like it if any one was to introduce her to some of your friends on the east side? How'd she like to hear about you from Hook, or from The Badger? How'd she like to take tea some afternoon with Felicia's daughter, Marianne, eh? - How much do you want? - 1,000 quid. - 1,000? - You got it! Now, don't tell me you ain't. - If you've learned as much about me as you say, you know better. You know about my gambling debts, at least, and those, the smallest of the lot. - You're lying. - Am I? It takes money to live the way I have done, all these years. Extraordinary amounts of it. I had a lot at one time but that was long ago. - Get it from your friends! - I'm borrowed to the hilt. I can't. - Get it! I don't care where! Get it from her if you have to. Yes, that sort of thing's right off your platter isn't it? Taking from the ladies. Well, she'll never miss it. She's got plenty, I hear. - You don't know what you are asking. - I'll give you a week. - - A week? - Have the money by then, or you can forget about marrying your miss Harwood. Because she won't like you so much, when I'm finished. 1,000 quid, remember? In one week. [ominous music playing] - I wish you'd tell me. Even though you think I'd worry, anything would be better than being left out. - Would it? - Don't you trust me? - I don't know. Yes, of course I do. The question is, can I trust myself? Am I strong enough? I know we agreed the past would have no hold in this, but I'm not sure that's possible. Can I escape what I am, what I have been, or has fate already decided for me? - No, please, don't talk that way. You frighten me. - I'm sorry. - Darling. - What? - I've been thinking. Why stay in London? Why not get away from all of the people and all of the places that have bad memories? Far away. Why not leave England? - Leave? I'm not sure I could. - Why not? - Various ties, obligations. My house, for one thing. I couldn't part with it. - You could always close it up. - Yes. Yes, I could, couldn't I? Would you come with me? Would you be willing to leave England? - Oh, how silly you are. What's England to me? The only happiness I knew here was with you. And Uncle Basil. He's gone now. There's only you. - Then you'd be willing? - I'll put this house up for sale, and after what-- - After what? - Oh, Dorian. - Miss Harward... At the risk of being forward... and though it shows unseemly presumption... Would you grant me the honor of your hand in marriage? Beatrice's suggestion had given me an idea. I would close the house, yes, but I would do more than that. I would seal the room containing the picture, close it so that no one would ever enter again. After that, there would remain only one real problem. What to do about Mr. James Vane? For the time being, there was little choice. If the slightest chance remained for me to escape from the picture and its curse, it was with Beatrice. I could risk anything but the loss of her love. I had to pay. Not all the money at once, of course. Only enough, each time, to ensure continued silence, and whet his appetite for more. I needed time, time while Beatrice's lawyers arrange the sale of her property; time in which to settle the details of our forthcoming marriage; and time to determine what to do about James Vane. [ominous music playing] [suspenseful music playing] - My God! [knocking at door] - Come. Alan, this is good of you. Thank you for coming. - Your note said a matter of life and death. - So it is. Sit down and I'll tell you. Have you breakfasted? - Yes, some time ago. - Oh, forgive me for not getting up. I twisted my ankle last night. It isn't serious. Gray, you know perfectly well I swore never to set foot in this house again. I came because your man insisted. Now, what is it? - I said, sit down, Alan. Now then, listen carefully. In a locked room, just down the hall, there is a dead man-- Wait. He's been dead approximately 10 or 11 hours. Who he is, why he died, how he died, these things don't concern you. - Gray, if you're serious-- - Quite serious. - I don't want to know more. Your horrible secrets don't interest me. - This one will have to interest you. I'm awfully sorry, Alan. But you're the one man who can help me. I'm to be married in a few days and I don't have time to go looking for assistance. Even if I did take the risk, it has to be you. - I don't know what you are talking about. - It's very simple, a man is dead, a nobody. No close friends, no relatives. I'm positive no one saw him come here. And, of course, no one must see him leave. Now then, you're a scientist, you know all about chemistry and that sort of thing. What you must do is destroy the evidence, every trace-- - Oh, my God-- - Sit down! - You're mad, Dorian. - Sit down! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian. - This is monstrous. I'll have nothing to do with it. - Alan, I couldn't help myself. It was self-defense. This man meant to destroy me, threatened to kill me. It was going to ruin everything. - I'm sorry. - You refuse? - Of course I refuse. - You can't refuse. - Even if I wanted to help you, I wouldn't do a thing like this. And I have no desire to help you. - Alan, I beg you, I entreat you. - Goodbye. - Brighton. Pembroke. Sir William Nolan. I'm awfully sorry, Alan, but I did try to spare you, didn't I? I pleaded with you as I've pleaded with no man. Now I must dictate. Oh, come now, the thing is quite simple. You've worked with cadavers countless times in your profession. I merely ask you to use your skills. - I can't. - You must. - I'll need to go home. There are some things I must get from my laboratory. - I think it would be better if you didn't leave the house till the job is done. You can write out a list of the things you want. My servant will take it around. Your man or someone can give him what you need. Take this away, Frederick. Oh, and bring me a sheet of note paper and a pen. After that, I have and errand for you. Are you sure you don't want anything for breakfast? [classical music playing] [upbeat music playing] - Best of luck, my child. - Thank you. Will you excuse me? - Charming. - I'm glad you approve. - Oh, I approve of any new experience, and marriage certainly is an experience. - I had no choice, really. I love her. - My dear boy, I love art... But I don't need to own every picture I admire. - Same old, Harry. - And the same old Dorian, I suspect. - What do you mean? - Now tell me the truth. Would you have married the girl if Basil's fortune hadn't come into the bargain? - I resent that. - You do? Oh, then you have changed. - I've begun a new existence, Harry. I mean to be a better person. Marrying Beatrice is the first step towards a decent life and I mean to be faithful to her. - Oh, yes, I know. How is it the young men want to be faithful, and are not, and old men want to be unfaithful, and can not. Oh, come, come. I'm only teasing. You know I don't mean half I say. - You mean half of it? - Oh, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you've had. How glad I am that you've never created anything. You've never carved a statue or painted a picture. Life has been your art. You've drunk deeply of everything. Nothing has been hidden from you. And yet you're still the same, still quite flawless. - This will be the final entry in this doleful journal. Tomorrow we close the house and leave England for good. Then workmen will close the nursery entrance and my long ordeal will end. - Dori. - Yes, my dear. - Why are you up? It's very late. - I couldn't sleep. I thought I'd get a little work done. Just details. You go to bed. - Will you come soon? - Very soon. - I've grown spoiled. - I'll be in soon. How she loves me. In marrying her, I know I've done a truly good thing at last. Harry was wrong. A bitter cynical man, he always was. I see that now. I wonder. Surely the picture should show some proof of my love. Not a great change, perhaps. There's too much to atone for, but a beginning. A line or a wrinkle less, something to indicate what my future can be. [suspenseful music playing] No! It was worse. That sneering laugh. It knew. It knew why I had married Beatrice. To escape, of course. I didn't love her, I didn't love anything. How could I, so long as this foul thing existed? So long as it knew every secret corner of my heart and of my brain, it would haunt me wherever I went, whatever I did, until it destroyed me, or I destroyed it. [screaming] - Oh! Dorian? Dorian! Dorian! Dorian? [gasping] [screaming] - A man's destiny, they say, is written in the stars. All he'll ever do, all he'll ever love, all he'll ever be. And, once written, they say, it can never be changed. If this be true, as I now suppose it must, then only one question remains: Who does the writing? If I knew the answer to that, if I could be sure, then I would know whether to curse God for what my life has been, or praise the devil. [suspenseful music playing]
