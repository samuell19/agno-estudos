Make an inventory of this rapid harvest. No problem. What's this? Who did this? Who else? Your son Chengfeng. Chengfeng. Chengfeng is getting into trouble. That half-hearted kid. Where is he? It's all good. Look who is back. Did you finish your task? You're back. Chengfeng. It's all good. Such a bad temper. Can't you talk to your son nicely? What do you want? You call that work? Those crops were hardly reaped. Is that what they taught you at the academy? Besides, who told you that you can ride him? Look at your shoe marks on my horse's belly. You know he's off limits. Report. Urgent message from Chief of Staff. Upon receiving this message, Commander Ma and you are to reply immediately. You ordered all horses to work the fields except for your precious ride. What else can I ride? You've given him a task. Why didn't you inform me? Stop right there. Come back. Stop right there. Punk. You better stop. Think you are tough? Let's move. Since May, Gen Okamura orchestrated a huge sweep-up operation, unleashing his hounds. Latest report indicated that on the 9th we had traitors who defected to the enemy. Our regiment's location might have been compromised. The commanders have ordered us to halt harvesting and sabotage operations. And break out of the encirclement. Light machine guns. Air burst. Grenade launchers. No heavy weapons. Not quite right, keep listening. Armoured units. West side. The planes are their vanguard. They are smoking us out. Inform every company to withdraw independently. Entire regiment is to rendezvous at Ziya River by daybreak tomorrow. Do you copy? Gone deaf? Copy that, Sir. Grain in Ear. Silent Shrike. I told you it's just an air raid. Japs don't tunnel. Message from Chief of Staff. Japs have discharged the dam. We are not the enemy. Release. - We are not the enemy. - Put down the gun. Put down. Not the enemy, put down your gun. Don't touch my stomach. Put her down. The urgent message is that Japs have discharged the dam. Our only chance of crossing is to detour via Dayin village. Sons of bitches. I want everyone accounted for. Get their finger prints. Every soul. Take it. It's for the road, bro. - No, thank you. - There's more. That's very kind of you, madam. Take it. Thank you, madam. My man gave me the gun. Around early spring he came home and left the gun with me. The name is Xiao Shuncheng. He claimed to be from 23rd Regiment. It's verified. Dachunzi is a military spouse. Been over 9 months. Baby is due soon. How's your neck? It's alright. Nasty scratch. Let me have a look. It's nothing. I said it's nothing. You deserved it for being mindless. Another inch and you're dead. What am I to do? Your family affairs are not my business. I was talking about these folks. What are you talking about? We don't have much time. They'll be doomed if the Japs get here. The river isn't far, but the path is mountainous. Are we bringing them or not? We'll bring them if it's possible, but I don't believe it is. 52 people, most of whom can barely walk. I heard that the Japs have left some villages untouched. Perhaps they can hide underground. You think you're smart and the Japs can't find them like we did? Exactly. We can't just hope for the best. Especially with military families. They will be eliminated. What are you blaming me for? Am I being heartless? Why are you yelling? I'm not yelling. Have I yelled? Japanese armoured vehicles are on our tail. Keep procrastinating and we might as well let Big Guy dig a larger grave for them and us, plus the horses. Mom. Whose child is this? Mom. Listen to me. Bring a few more men. What if you can't find the 3rd Company? Bring Chengfeng along. When it comes to intel-collecting, he's better than either one of us. You trust me with your child. If anything happens to him, how am I gonna tell you? I'm already grateful that Huang Rui is with me. My marksmanship has no rivals in the cavalry and the army. You're almost perfect, except for your bragging. What's the bloody hurry? Make haste. Even if it's the last thing I do, I'll steer this bull to the south. When you have crossed the river, send up a flare. Wang. Stay safe and sound. God is on our side. Dachunzi tried every horse and none was mountable. She said they'll rock her baby out. Can't even complete such a simple task. You think I am not busy? She lost her man. What? Her man is dead. I didn't know what to say when she asked me. A while ago, at Raoyang, the entire 23rd Regiment was wiped out. You. Come here. Can you take care of him? Of course. Sankui. Eat this. Leave them to Big Boss. Listen up, if you want to live, follow us. Big Boss. Be careful. Don't kick his belly. Who is Big Boss? Do as you're told. Obey all military orders. Big Boss. To my father, this horse is more precious than I am. Get moving, old lady. Honey. Honey. Our valuables are under the bed. The Japs have eyes everywhere. When I give the order, everyone is to keep their mouth shut. If you have to fart, keep it inside your pants. Let's go. Keep moving. Enemy aircraft. Take cover. Enemy aircraft. Take cover. Spread out and protect the civilians. Not that way. Come this way. Spread out and protect the civilians. Go. Quickly. Hide underground. Futing and Yupo. Monkey and Jingguo. Mount and shoot. Yang and Long, prepare for ambush. Erya. Erya. Go. Big Guy. Wait till he takes the bait. Grandpa. I know. For your grandpa. Big Guy. For your grandpa. Grandpa. All the other companies have crossed the river except for 3rd. No news about Commissar, Huang Rui and them. No news is good news. Commissar must have led them into the maze. From a young age, I've never been treated like he was. What is this? Mugwort. Rub it over your neck wound. Back in the Combined Arms Brigade, there was this kid from Shanxi and tetanus took his life. He was about your age. You think I'm afraid of death? I fear that you are not. I joined the army in 1925. I've seen too much. I was leading a recon platoon last year, and on Mount Taihang I encountered my first poison gas. About half the platoon, horses and men, their bodies were covered with blisters. My life was saved by Big Boss's speed. I am alive because I'm always the first to charge. When you wanted to join the army your mom went berserk with me. If you want to be a hero, I won't stop you. But my son can never be a casualty. I chose to defend our country but I feel guilty about your mother. If you have to die, die after me. Or else I'll be ashamed to face your mother. He peed on your hand. You did the same at his age. Nothing noticeable. The Japs are finally quiet. Our regiment has crossed the river. - Any news of Commissar? - None. How about this? I'll take a few men to search for them with fast horses. We'll return by daybreak. I heard that. Count me in. You. Without me, how are you gonna get any messages out? I'll take the transmitter and leave the receiver behind. When you rendezvous with the regiment, send up a flare. When I see the flare I'll send you a situation briefing immediately. Let's seize this opportunity while the Japs are taking a nap. Commander. No kicking of his belly. Copy that. What's wrong? An emergency. Once we use the transmitter the Japs will locate us. District Command demands radio silence for all units while operating in enemy-occupied areas. Bloody Japs. That's why we can't shake them off. The Japs are betting big. Looks like a lot of men. We can't outrun them. If we fight how long can we last? Given our firepower, we might last for 30 seconds, or perhaps just five. Grandpa. Anywhere beyond this bend and we'll be made. Bloody Japs. We might die anyway. I say we take some of them with us. Get your weapons ready. Hold on. Radio guy. Colonel. The cavalry's last transmission was from these mountains. Without my orders, nobody moves. All units, forward. Chao. Shoot the flare. What? Shoot the flare. Shoot the flare. Shoot the flare. Shoot it. Good news at last. They've crossed the river. Halt. Halt. Chengfeng's message. Commissar and Huang Rui were killed in action. We Regroup immediately. Colonel, we just intercepted their radio signal, which came from Yechenzuo village. This flare is a decoy. The real target is the village. Move out. What's going on? Why are the Japs withdrawing? Commander, you asked Chengfeng to transmit when he sees the flare. Everyone, get ready to move out. Keep moving. Quickly. Quickly, the villagers have arrived. Mother, there are boats. We're saved. The boats are here for us. Colonel, no more Chinese troops to be found. Thank goodness. We're saved. Thank you so much. We're saved. Go. Our signal triangulation was cracked by the enemy. Colonel, they've tricked us. Looks like they have a death wish. Chengfeng, don't try to be like your father. This battle is not yours to fight. It's still undetermined who'll be the first to charge. Fire. Stop. Baby's coming out. It's a boy. Colonel, the Chinese troops on the hill are defenseless, we will eliminate them soon. Release. Enemy cavalry spotted at our rear. Turn all cannons around. Turn all cannons around. Quickly. Fire. Fire. Quickly. Stop the charging cavalry. Stop the charging cavalry. Stop them now. All weapons free. Fire at will. Bastard. They are coming towards us. Their horses are too fast. Hold the line. Don't fall back. They're getting close. They're too fast. Charge. Charge. I'm Luo Tong. For honor and glory I fight the battles. What do you want? Kid. Commander. It's alright. Here. You are Sankui. Mother. Mother. What's wrong? This is your child? What's his name? What's his name? Chengfeng. No running. Wait till I catch you... Kid, this is not a playground. I'll beat you up! Look at the mess you made. Get out! An explosion! Another explosion! Hurry, if you're too slow, you'll miss it. Get up there! Quick! Wait for me! Get out of the way! Can you see it? I see smoke. Come down! Over there. The data before the test run was fine. I don't know what caused the explosion. Let's send the debris for analysis. Yes. We must pinpoint the explosion point to determine the cause of the explosion. Then we must account for the entire ignition process. Cameras alone are not sufficient. Next time I will inspect it visually, if that's what it takes. Master Yu, I heard your son was in another fight. With whom? With Master Zhang's son. Dont't worry about it. Master, Take a break, please. Smells good. We are having meat today! Wow, meat! Your loss if you don't eat some. Own up to your mistake, or you won't get to eat. I won't eat then. I did nothing wrong. But you got into a fight with Little Four Eyes. Look at him. Clearly, he lost to Four Eyes. He lost the fight. I hit him first. Of course, I didn't lose. Tell your mother that you are sorry. Then you get to eat. I won't. Then I must teach you a lesson. I will ask you one more time. Are you sorry? No. Shush. Are you sorry? No. You dare talk back to me! You're not sorry for hitting someone? That's enough. Let's eat. You should have listened to me. You could have avoided the spanking. Let's eat. Let's. I know why my brother was fighting. Brother Four Eyes said Dad makes firecrackers. Whoever makes firecrackers you could have avoided the spanking. Dad, where's the meat? Stop hiding. Come out. Here, eat this. Dad, what exactly do you do? Do you make firecrackers? Of course not. Then what do you do? I'm a... I'm a poet. My job is to write poems in the sky. How do you write poems in the sky? That's a secret. Children aren't allowed to know. I don't care what you do, as long as you're not making firecrackers. Of course I'm not making firecrackers. If Big Brother asks again whether or not we could die, what do we tell him? Just tell the truth. No, that's too cruel. I don't think he will take it well. But, how can we avoid the topic? Accidents happen. From the first day of our research on solid fuels, since we knew that China was developing from scratch, and that it would take trial and error, we've already understood. What are you writing? A poem. A poem, you? I told our son I'm a poet. Let me read it. It's not finished yet. I'll show you when it's done. Just a quick look! If you're not working late today, go to the village, see if you can buy some meat. Buy meat? To satisfy our children's cravings. I've been craving meat for a long time. Then get more. Wait. The poem I wrote, see if you like it. Brother, I'm scared. Don't be. Get up. Shredded meat! Go ahead. It's delicious! Where did we get the meat? A gift from your father's co-worker. Where's Dad? Where did you two go last night? I will save a piece for Dad. Where did you go, you and Dad? We went to buy meat for you. Be quiet! I now call this meeting to order. I'll speak first. My dad hasn't come home in days. Mom told me he has to put in extra hours. I found it odd too. My dad hasn't come home either. My mom was crying. Maybe he will not come back. What does that mean? It means he's gone to heaven. So he won't come home. Stop catastrophizing, you wimp. You're ruining our meeting. Stop arguing. Rather than speculating here, we might as well go investigate. What do you say to that? - Okay, let's go. - Okay. Let's go. According to Comrade Shi Ruhong's report, prior to his death, plus the data analysis from this accident, we have established that the explosion happened in the engine head. The modified propellant formulation was not good enough. We need to run the test again. The heat insulation layer needs to be partially thickened. For our next test, we need to reduce the engine speed. All these could be major causes of an accident. Who are the comrades from the propellant trimming workshop? Do you think you could improve the trimming accuracy of the propellant surface to under 0.5 mm? Can you do that? Comrade Yu Kaiying. Didn't I tell you to take some time off? I can improve the accuracy to 0.2 mm. Where are you hiding? Show yourself. - Why are you crouching? - Stand up. What are you all doing in the factory? Looking for my dad. Me too. What's your father's name? Zhang Xiaoping. And yours? My father's name... What's my father's name? His father's name is Big Dummy. What are you laughing at? Stand still. Speak when spoken to You... What's your father's name? Shi Ruhong. Come again? Shi Ruhong. Stop going to there to look for your father. He doesn't work there anymore. Then where is he? What exactly does he do? There's a thing called a Kongming Lantern. You light a candle in the middle, and the heated air inflates the lantern. Then it can fly. That's what your father makes. But... He makes something much much bigger. Many times more impressive. And it can lift very heavy objects up into the sky. That's how he writes his poems. He promised to write one for me. This is the poem I wrote. See if you like it. See you tonight. See you tonight. Comrades. Three months from now, the solid propellant engine we are responsible for making will be needed for a docking test with the rest of the rocket. Three months to go, comrades. Gauge the propellant. 0.8 mm, Master. This is a tough battle. But, when we succeed, we will have our satellite in space. 0.6 mm. Here's the poem your father wrote for you. Just one line. 0.4 mm. Here's another poem your father wrote for you. Get up. It's raining. Don't just stand there! Close the window now! They said there would be heavy rain, those of us on overtime were told to return home! Dad! Mom! Brother! Dad is back. Where is he? These houses can't withstand heavy rain! Dad! Mom! Everyone please stay calm! Don't panic! They are sending people over to help! Dad. - Are you two ok? - Mom, what took you so long? I was scared. - I'm here now. - Where's Dad? Don't be afraid. Come here. Stay here. Okay. Where's dad? Your dad is working late. Hey! - Where are you going? - Mom, don't leave me. I'm not leaving. Don't cry. - Point the light in mom's direction. - Okay. Is my father dead? Come inside. Close the door. I won't come in until you tell me. We will talk inside. Tell me quickly! Don't stand in the rain! - Why won't you tell me? - Come inside. We will talk inside. What can't you tell me? I've been going house to house. All their fathers are back. Except mine. Is he dead? Yes, your father is dead. You're lying. My father isn't dead. I want my father. I'm your father now. My father is a man, and you are a woman. I can do what your father did. My father writes poems. You can't. Forget about poems. We need to battle. My father can howl like a wolf. Can you? My father spanks me. You've never spanked me. Don't make me. Hit me then. I don't hit you, huh? What about now? It doesn't hurt. - It doesn't hurt. - Don't you talk back to me. Mom, stop hitting. I didn't hit you because I didn't have the heart to. Has your father really hit you before? My father and my father before him. Are both dead. Mom, stop hitting. Mom, stop hitting. Mom, stop hitting. They're both dead. Does it hurt? You are late picking up your son today. What's the holdup? Long story. The test failed. We will try the new formulation tomorrow. I hope my son was not too much trouble? He's a sweet boy. Then I will take him home now. Maybe let him stay the night with us? He may keep you up. He already sleeps over all the time. I don't want to impose. It's not a bother. Plus, I'm counting on your son to take care of our little one in the future. Go home and get some rest. Okay. Good luck with tomorrow's test. I will take it. I have a favor to ask. Could you help me hide his death from the children? Especially Big Brother. It would devastate him. His biological father also died here. Starting today, could all the male comrades avoid going home? Tell your family that you're working overtime. Before the mission is complete, We... We must not let the children know that their father is gone. Master Are you alright, Master? Do you need a break? We don't have the time. The test is approaching. 0.2 mm. Give me the number one blade. Gauge it. Okay. Run! Are you on a hunger strike? There. The poem your father wrote for you. Now it's finished. My father didn't write it. Listen to me. You are turning ten next month. I want to start treating you as an adult. Let's talk like adults. Can we do that? Brother, can this really fly? I'll count down from three, and we will let go, okay? Okay. Three. Two. One. It's flying! Mom. Please don't die! Please don't die! It's possible that I could die too. You won't die. The thing that your father made is similar to this lantern. Both rely on the fire in the middle to fly to the heavens. My job is to make the fire. But it's a dangerous job. If something bad happens, I'll die too. You won't die. You never know. In case I die, would you regret still holding a grudge against your mother? In our family, you're now the man of the house. When Mom is not around, you have to look after your sister for me. Okay? I'm sorry, child. Your father and your mother may not be there to see you grow up. Comrades. This is our final test run. We won't get a second chance. Are we confident? Yes. Can we complete the mission? Yes, we can. Brother. If only Mom and Dad had lived to see this day, they would be incredibly proud. Their little girl who used to be afraid of everything, and now, she is an astronaut. When mom passed a few years ago, I made a wish. I wanted too, to go up there and write poems. Comrade Commander-in-Chief, Astronaut Shi Tiannuo reporting for duty for this manned mission. We're all set. Waiting for instructions. Manned spacecraft Shenzhou has entered the countdown phase. Astronaut Shi Tiannuo is about to embark on her first trip to space. My children. If I could, I would tell you all the mysteries of this world. I would tell you about our great mountains and rivers. About the rising sun and setting moon. Our honor and dreams, frustrations and sorrows. I would tell you, in making fuel, we light up ourselves to illuminate the dreams of others. In making rockets we give up what is ours, to achieve a collective vision. Life is to be used for a cause. Death is affirmation of life The vast universe makes our death so insignificant. Tiny dust particles are the beginning of the universe. Our small steps today are the beginnings of greatness. And you, my children, give us, ordinary as we are, the will to begin creating a beautiful new world. My Father My father's name is Zhao Pingyang. He's got a big head and a chubby body. Ever since I was little, people have said my father disregards his responsibilities and always tries to find the easy way out. But I disagree. My father is good at learning new things and has great computation skills. A sofa in the furniture store costs? 95.7. My father thinks that's too expensive, so he spent? 0.31 on a carpentry book and drew up blueprints himself. Then he spent? 8.5 on some scrap wood and built a new sofa. But then he ran into yet another problem. While moving upstairs the sofa got stuck in the stairwell. Others said his efforts were wasted but my dad faced the challenge head-on and came up with a brilliant idea. Lift! Up, up! He made a pulley and successfully hoisted the sofa upstairs. Let's go. Watch out. The sofa fit perfectly in our house. My mom was particularly satisfied. What is this? The zig zag bridge at City God Temple? Are you doing puzzles here? In the end the fabric, the springs and the tools cost? 31.06 in total. My dad said that by building this sofa he basically earned? 64.64. My dad is also warm-hearted towards the neighbors and approaches comrades with enthusiasm. My neighbors fought over splitting water bills. So my dad installed individual water meters for each family. The monthly water bill was reduced by? 0.72. The installation cost was earned back in just a year and a half, which the neighbors were happy to pay. And they even praised my dad as a central figure in the realization of the four modernization developing strategies. My dad cares for the people. He took time out of his busy schedule to go to rural areas and visits farmers. After thorough research my dad decided to help them expand their product distribution channels. He was particularly supportive of the duck eggs selling in the production brigade. One kilogram of duck eggs costs? 1.5, and once transported to the city it is sold for? 1.9. 15 kilograms each time, minus 10 % in incidental fees, and he could earn? 5.4. The other day my dad was appointed by his factory to attend the Canton Fair. Unintimidated by neither hardship nor fatigue. He brought back 40 cute tropical fish from Guangzhou, which greatly enriched Uncle Jiang's life after retirement. My dad spent? 0.2 on each fish, which he sold for? 0.5 to Uncle Jiang. Subtracting? 1.7 for the fish tank and? 0.05 the tube, this time my dad earned another? 10.25. My dad is also strict with himself and never wastes money. It takes? 0.04 to make a three-minute call on a public telephone. He keeps an eye on his watch every time he makes a call and hangs up the phone at exactly two minutes and fifty-nine seconds, refusing to spend an extra? 0.04. Hello Six Seven Eight And so because of all these virtues, my dad has become the most pupolar person in our neighborhood. He has told everyone that in the future there will be phones without cords, trains without wheels, bridges over the Huangpu River, and skyscrapers in Pudong. Some of the neighbors don't believe him and say he's speaking nonsense. There is a saying The duck is a prophet of spring when the river becomes warm. The duck what? The duck prophet. I see. So you are this duck. And so from that day on, my dad was given a nickname The duck prophet The duck prophet is coming back. Through his hard work, my family has? 386.5 in savings now. My dad was also appointed as the sales manager at the 2nd Traditional Pharmaceutical Factory. Their product sales have since continuously reached record-breaking highs. I must learn from my dad and train myself to be a useful person to the people. Zhao Xiaodong's essay is lively and vivid, which is something worth learning from. Ms. Qian, He's bragging! We're neighbors. Since his dad was appointed as sales manager, the company's medicinal wine hasn't been selling well at all. If you don't believe me, just go to his house and look. His entire house is packed with medicinal wine. His dad has spent all their money - on buying the medicinal wine - Stop it and their savings dropped into the negatives a long time ago. His dad was also kicked out of their house by his mom. Go live in your father's house or else we get a divorce. And now they're about to divorce. It's not true. You're lying. Do you know who his father is? Who is he? There used to be a man who always sold duck eggs in front of our school gate. And that man is his father. Embarrassed by his father, Dongdong avoided him every day after school. I can pay for it, all right? Duck prophet! Yes! Duck prophet! Stop it! Be quiet! Put it down! Mr. Zhao, I can understand that kids often put their parents on a pedestal in essays. But what kind of person would you like Dongdong to be? You can't let him solely pursue materialistic goals. He must also have spiritual pursuits. You need to encourage him to be more like Chen Jingrun, someone who makes significant contributions to our country even without sitting on a couch. I never prevented him from becoming more like Chen Jingrun. Then what's the deal with all the wine at your house? This Ginseng Longan Wine is produced by our factory - The 2nd Traditional Pharmaceutical Factory. It's made from a traditional recipe with real ingredients. But I'd like to sell it in an untraditional way. Comrade Duck Prophet, as a sales manager at a state-owned factory, please don't focus your attention on such crooked methods. All the students are laughing at Dongdong now. Go home and do some self-reflection. Put it in the bag. That's Dongdong and his dad. Dongdong and his dad. Isn't that the Duck Prophet? Dongdong, come here. Dongdong. Hurry up, Dongdong! Hurry! Dongdong, come up quickly. - Don't push. It's overcrowded already. - Dongdong, hurry up. - Just get off. - Make some room. Come on, come on. - Dongdong. Dongdong, hurry up. - Get off. Dongdong. What's wrong? Are you upset with me? Did I embarrass you? Yes, you did. I'll behave better next time and try to make you proud. When is next time? Next time is just next time. Mom. Let me do it. Honey I'm so grateful for you. Why did he bring you home today? I passed by the school today, so I picked him up and brought him home. Honey. This is your favorite dessert. - I'm not going back tonight. - Cut it out. You and your horrible wine get out of this house together and go to your dad's. What you just said isn't objective. This wine is at the very least made from a traditional recipe, with real ingredients. How could it be horrible? Plus, we already bought a sewing machine, which means our life is pretty good. How dare you say that? Are you out of your mind? If you hadn't promised to sell thousands of bottle of wine in a year, would your factory have overstocked so much wine? And as if that wasn't enough, you continued to bite off more than you can chew. As you know, this house wasn't big to begin with, but now we have got neither money nor space. I went to No.1 Food store on Nanjing road today and convinced them to sell our wine from next month on. The distribution channel is alreadu opened. Just keep bragging! Do you think I'll still believe in you? Let me tell you, Zhao Pingyang. This is my last warning. You must get rid of this terrible wine within a month. Either you drink it all or pour it into the Huangpu River. Does it taste good? Don't worry. It's fine. Your mom has more bark than bite. Are you sure you can sell all the wine? Are you bragging again? How come you don't believe me either? I've already come up with a solution. But to implement this solution, I need you to do me a favor. What is it? Little Fatty. Did you expose Dongdong in school today? Who told you my wine is not selling well? It's... My dad. I knew it was him. I'm running around every day doing actual things, while your dad just smokes, drinks tea and reads the newspaper all day in the office. He's in no position to criticize me. If I sell all the wine within a month, you must apologize to Dongdong. Otherwise I'll cut your big ears off and have them with my wine. Little Fatty's big ears are getting even bigger. It's a sign of good luck. Didn't I tell you to go home and finish your homework? Then why are you still here? Go home. Kicked out by your wife? Absence makes the heart grow fonder. What do you know? You remember the lines, right? Suppose your mom and I actually get a divorce, what would you do? Would you choose your mom or me? Mom. Listen, we're not going to get a divorce. Don't sulk. You must work with me after getting on the bus. Did you hear me? Oh my gosh! Buddy. Please don't knock over my medicinal wine. Mister, mister. Are you holding the Ginseng Longan Wine? Yes. It is. How did you know? My grandpa is very fond of it. He said there is longan, Yu zhu and ginseng in it. With real ingredients, it not only boosts vitality and nourishes blood, promotes fluid production and benefits the lungs, but also relax muscles and improves eyesight. Since he's begun to drink this wine, my grandpa has been eating well, sleeping well, glowing with health and jumping high, as if he's suddenly ten years younger. Really? Then you should definitely tell your grandpa to drink more of this wine. Where did you get this? How much did it cost? The usual price is? 30. But I know someone from the factory so I got it for only? 18 Then if my grandpa buys it from you, could you make it a bit cheaper so he can buy a bottle too? In that case I'll be bankrupt! But on behalf of the admirable care you give your grandpa, I'll make it? 16 for you. Wow, that's a steal. Then my grandpa must buy more. Treasure! What a Treasure! Longan, Yu zhu, Ginseng, with real ingredients. If my grandpa wants to buy from you, please just sell him a bottle. Relaxes the muscles and improves eyesight. Mister, please sell it to me. I need replenishment too. - Boosts vitality and nourishes blood, - promotes fluid production and benefits the lungs. Mister I'm begging you to sell me this. Mister. You are a living Lei Feng, sacrificing yourself for others. Our whole family will remember your kindness forever. Oh my gosh! Is this the legendary Ginseng Longan Wine? Eat well. Sleep well. Jump high. Leap far. Glow with health. Jump high. Do you want some? No. Mister, I must criticize you. Don't you think it's very selfish of you to not sell me any of the wine? Honey, should we buy two bottles of the wine for your dad? It's too expensive. It will make your dad happy, which means you won't beat me again. I'll take two bottles. Duck Prophet. I've been watching you for quite a while. When was your son adopted by others? How did I not know? I can't believe you called him mister. Why don't you call him comrade? Comrade, please don't be fooled. This guy is the sales manager at a pharmaceutical factory. And this boy is his son. What they're trying to sell is in very low demand. It's not! There's nothing wrong with the quality. Nonsense. We have everything we need, right? Yes. Comrades, are you working for the Shanghai TV Station? Are you doing news reporting? We're going to film the retirement home for the Double Ninth Festival. What a coincidence! I work for the 2nd Traditional Pharmaceutical Factory. We're also going to visit the elderly at their retirement home for the Double Ninth Festival. Could you film our visit as well? Sure. Cut. Good. You done? Done. Director, could you film one more shot of me opening the bottle and the elderly drinking the wine and their satisfied smiles? No. No. This is not how we do news reports. Then could you take one more close-up shot and make sure our brand logo is big and clear? Close-up? Do you have any idea how much it costs for a 10-second shot? How much? Enough to buy 25 kilos of pork belly. Our factory can pay for it. It's not something you can just pay for. We are not making an advertisement for you. Advertisement? What is an advertisement? Mr. Feng, the elderly performing Tai Chi are ready. Young Comrade, what is an advertisement? An advertisement is a very short film broadcasted on TV, aimed at promoting and selling products. That's great! It suits us. Can we film an advertisement? We don't have that in China only abroad. Our TV station never broadcasts ads. Never before but never in the future either? I'm not sure. But there are articles about this in the paper and our leaders are discussing it too. Well how about if I hire you to make an advertisement, would you do it? I could. But you'll have to pay for it. Either way Mr. Feng won't agree to it. I'm not asking Feng. I'm asking you. May I have your name please? You can call me Xiao Ma. Director Ma. Advertisement? Do you know anyone who's made an advertisement before? I've talked about it to a senior staff at the TV station. According to reliable sources, it's probable that they'll start broadcasting ads soon. We must seize this opportunity. It could be the first TV advertisement in China. Manager Zhao, I have a TV set in my house which I watch everyday. But I have never seen anything like you described. Do you think I'm stupid enough to pay for something I've never seen before? It won't cost very much. Stop talking. We now have an abundance of wine in stock just because I believed in what you have said. Please think about some practical solutions. Don't shoot for the moon. Do you drink this wine? I don't drink wine. Do you think I can drink it all? Do you know what an advertisement is? What is it? You don't even know what an advertisement is. Dongdong, please listen to me. Your mom has demanded that I sell all the wine within a month, right? There are only 15 days left as of today. So you have to help me get the key to the wooden chest, and take out the household registration booklet inside, in case your mom is going to divorce me in a rage. I don't think you actually want the household registration booklet. You just want me to steal my mom's money for your advertisement. My boy is smart indeed. It's not stealing but simply borrowing your mom's money to make an ad. When the advertisement is done, our family will also be secured. Dongdong. Dongdong. This is the only money we have left. Mom will definitely divorce you once she finds out. I know. Do you remember what I said before The duck is a prophet of spring when the river becomes warm. It is only because the duck isn't afraid to go into the river that it is able to feel when the water becomes warm and able to capture fish. Always be the first duck brave enough to jump into the river. But I feel we're already in the river. Right, Then do you dare to be a brave duck? Yes. My good boy. Mom, give me the key. Where's yours? I left it home. Why didn't you leave yourself home? Finish your homework first and don't mess around. OK. Today is my first date with Zhao. He's a good guy. It's the happiest day in my life. Have another pork chop. I've already figured out the story. A minute and a half in total. The story will be about a family of three that goes to a store to buy the Ginseng Longan Wine as a gift for their grandpa, who is very satisfied after drinking the wine. Manager Zhao, thank you for the noodles. But this is very difficult. You asked for money which I got now. Even if I could get a hold of the camera by using news reporting as an excuse, what about the film negatives? It requires four leaders' signatures to get the negatives. Then we'll buy some. Have you seen a store that sells film negatives? It's not something you can just buy. Without a letter of introduction, you can't even hire actors or book filming locations. Just forget it. Xiao Ma, Director Ma. We had a deal. You can't just give up now. Come on, think about it. If the advertisement is well filmed, then you would be the first TV ad director in all of China. The first one. The progenitor. The founder. I'll take care of the film negatives and the actors. You just let me know what your requests are for the filming location. It should be a place with grandeur. Yes. Style. Yes. And a feeling of natural and harmonious. Then we can do it in my house. Waiter, another bowl of noodles please. Got it. The unexposed head of negative reels are supposed to be discarded, but I think it's quite a waste, so I've been keeping them for years. Luckily, they're long enough for your short film. They're already spliced together. Here you go. Thank you. How dare you come here? The fish you have sold me last time turned upside down within a few days. Not even. They died on the night we bought them. Give my? 20 back. I will give you? 30 and you can keep the change. Just do me a favor. Look. You'll have the opportunity to be on the cover. I've already told you Zhao Pingyang. I've never thought about becoming an actress. You're such a beautiful lady. It'd be a shame if you don't go into acting. You should come too, Xiao Mei. I'll make you a movie star. On your birthday we're going to film at the drugstore in the morning and at our house in the afternoon. What I'm sayning now is very crucial. You have to let your mom take you out to Nanjing Road and stay there for 6 hours. You can't come back home until the time is up It's all or nothing. This is called luring the enemy away from their base. What are you looking at? Nothing. Hurry up! Everyone must move quickly. We've only got 6 hours in total to film the rest of the shots. We must remember the original location of all the furniture and put everything back after we're done My wife must not spot any difference. Dongdong, it's your birthday today. I'll let you have anything you want. Mom. I want to have some pork mooncakes. Sure. The line is so long. Let's go. A long line means the mooncakes must be yummy. I want to have some pork mooncakes. If there's no line, then it's not yummy? Let's rehearse it first. Ready. Action! Father, this is a present for you. Ginseng Longan Wine. May you be healthy, live long and prosper. Cut. That's too pompous. Oh. Be lifelike. Oh. Be natural. Oh. Ok? I got it. Be more lifelike. Sorry. Right. Let's do a first take. Rolling. Action! Dad, This Gingan Lonseng Wine is for you. Sorry I mispronounced words. Cut. Why did you look at the camera? I'm sorry. Don't be nervous. You make mistakes more easily when nervous. Take a deep breath. Adjust my relaxing. No. Adjust my breathing. Just relax. Rolling. Action! Dad, This is a father for you. Don't buy this. Let's go. Mom, I'm still hungry. I'm exhausted. Stop eating. Mom, I'd also like to go to the cinema. Which film do you want to watch? Manhunt. You've already seen it six times with your dad. Then I want to see Mistress Xiang Lin. Do you have any idea who she is? I think She looks like my grandma. Let's go. Your grandma? Dongdong. Watch the car. Cut. This shot is done. Let's do a close-up. Move the light. Director, how many shots are left? Quite a few. Come on. Be quick. Mom, I'd like to watch the film again. Why do you like this film so much? Let's go home. Let's go. What's wrong? What's wrong? Mom, I have a stomachache. Where? Here? Yes. Look at you! You ate so much it's no surprise you have a stomachache. Does it hurt here? Yes, it does. Take it easy. What about here? Yes. It's quite serious. You'll need a few acupuncture treatments. Acupuncture. Mom, I suddenly feel fine. What's the matter with you? That's weird. Oh well I just farted. That is weird. The light is too dim now. Change it to a brighter light. Quickly. I think it's fine. No. It's not. We're running out of time. Little Fatty is coming back soon. We don't have much time. Let's start. You are so annoying. Absence makes the heart grow fonder everyday. Boosts vitality. Nourishes blood. A good wine. Good. Cut. This shot is done. Now let's take the last shot. Great. My wife is sick in bed. Are you guys setting up this search... setting up this searchlight to illuminate her? That's despicable. Stop what you're doing. Sorry. Mr.Fatty. We're making a film. That's none of my business. But you must not disturb your neighbors. And we're neighbors. Please don't be upset. Cut the nonsense! It really doesn't hurt? No. Little Fatty, Why are you sitting here? Dongdong, My parents didn't let me stay home. Can I go to your house to watch the film being shot? What film? What's going on? Fake! Even the vase is fake. You filmmakers always deceive audience with fake things. Shame on you. Shame on you. Mr. Fatty. Calm down. Please don't be mad. Stop talking! I won't allow you to continue filming today. Just give me five minutes for the last shot. I won't even give you one second. Stop filming! I won't allow it! You can wait for the sun. Mr. Fatty! Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Mr. Fatty, I bought this blanket when Zhao and I got married. I've never used it. Are you satisfied now? Can you please give him five minutes to finish filming? Can you? Put the flowers in the vase. I have something else to do. Then let's continue filming. Back to your positions. (Three Months Later) Then we'll follow your instructions. Xiao Ma. President. I heard that you've made an ad? Yes. Our TV station has been thinking about launching an advertising business. Show me your ad. Yes, okay. President, do we need to report this to the leaders and ask what they think before we proceed? Just in case. I'm afraid we might be accused of making mistakes regarding principle. What mistakes? It already passed the conference vote to expand enterprise production, increase economic efficiency, and improve people's living standards. Those are the biggest principles. Don't worry. I'll take responsibility if anything bad happens. I'll fetch it for you. OK. Don't try to fool me. I've made films before too. Dear audience, today is Sunday 28th of January 1979, the first day of the first lunar month. The following is the main content of the news program Today is the 37th day after the closing of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Cadres and masses from all walks of life organized spontaneously to study the Communiqu? Of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Tell Dongdong to stop watching TV. He sits there waiting for the ad everyday. Dongdong, stop watching TV. This wine won't sell well anyway. I'll take two bottles to your grandpa's to celebrate the New Year. When will the ad be broadcasted? Probably never. I have no idea. Do you think I'm useless? Next time you write an essay, feel free to write whatever you want about me, all right? Are you ready? Let's go. Put on your sweater. OK. Turn off the TV, Dongdong. Zhao Pingyang, grab a few more bottles of wine for you dad. Don't waste good wine. Dad, mom, come and watch the ad. Come. Where? Dad, this present is for you. Ginseng Longan Wine. May you be healthy, live long and prosper. Ginseng Longan Wine. Boosts vitality. Nourishes blood. A good wine for family and friends. Give Ginseng Longan Wine as a present. This Ginseng Longan Wine is really hard to get. It's so hard to buy this wine. It's so hard to buy. Good product. Be quick. I told you it's hard to get. Over there. Hurry up. Hello comrade. How's this wine been selling today? Very well. Almost sold out. Usually just few people purchase it. But for some reason, today everyone's here to buy it. That's because of its traditional recipe and real ingredients. That's true. I remember now, something my dad once said to me. Dongdong, I believe that you'll become a successful person one day. But it's at this momment that I can finally believe what my dad said was true. My father was perhaps indeed a duck prophet. Dad, this present is for you. Ginseng Longan Wine. May you be healthy, live long and prosper. Ginseng Longan Wine. Boosts vitality. Nourishes blood. A good wine for family and friends. Give Ginseng Longan Wine as a present. Since then advertisements have reached every family in China and have become a part of our lives. My dad was not only the first advertiser in China, but also one of the first people who bought stocks, used mobile phones, and bought commodity housing in Pudong. What others regarded as his daydreams turned out all to be true. Many said my dad was the duck prophet, a miraclulous man, able to predict the future. I only finally understood when I grew up that he is not the miracle, but ourselves. Later, I became an engineer. In 2016 I led my team to build the tallest building in China: Shanghai Tower. There are 285 commercial buildings in Lujiazui with 43,000 companies inside. Our generation is also creating a new world full of hope. A bright new world. Son. What are you writing? What's the height of the Shanghai Tower that you designed? 632 meters. Is it the tallest in China? It's the second tallest in the world. Why are you writing it down? For my essay. The title is My Father. Dad, mom, are you looking through the binoculars again? Your dad has looked over 100 times. That red roof used to be our old house. I know. I found it a long time ago. Well, this building you designed is absolutely amazing. Like I said before, The duck is a prophet of spring when the river becomes warm. Always be The first duck that dares to jump into the river. That's right I'm sorry! I will never do that again. Where has gone the hot water? Mom, it was my fault. Where has gone the hot water? I was half way in my shower when the hot water ran out. How dare you to take apart the water heater, huh? Sorry. The fan The hair dryer The vacuum cleaner Besides, What are these? I was wondering why all the appliances in our house keep breaking and breaking after repairs. Now I see. If there is one thing in this house to be fixed, that is you. Kid, say goodbye to your plane. You are not taking apart the appliances; you are tearing our mother-son relationship apart. Mom. The ceiling light fell off by itself. I didn't do anything! As if it doesn't want to live, like the way you don't. Listen, let me explain. For a static object, if an external force is greater than the friction, it naturally moves. And that external force might be the gravity or some unknown, mysterious force. The force is neither unknown nor mysterious. Let me show you. Aren't you familiar? Is this the force you are referring to? Is it mysterious? The ball is mine. Yours? Can you guys keep down your construction noise? It shook off our ceiling light. My mom thought I did it. See the works of her spank. Generally speaking, mothers spank for guiding ways. Then, can you see the ways my mother is guiding? Your mother lost her way. Forget about it You should apologize right now. Your mother spanked you. You should tell your mother to apologize. Give back the ball. Xiaoxiao, stop dragging your feet. You are getting late for school. Don't think about getting your ball back. Fanfan, the teacher said that Empress Dowager Cixi was buried with a priceless jewel in her mouth, the luminous pearl. Yeah, so? It is right here. Didn't the teacher say that it was lost long time ago in some foreign countries? You know, my dad is a special agent, and he brought it back. If you like it, I don't mind if you play it for some days. You, big liar! Come, everybody. Xiaoxiao said this luminous pearl belonged to Empress Dowager Cixi. Empress Dowager Cixi? Must be a fake. Getting things from Empress Dowager Cixi, your dad must be an imperial eunuch. Rebound. Your dad is an imperial eunuch. Bounce back. Your dad is an eunuch. Xiaoxiao's dad is a special agent. Don't believe him. Few days ago, he just said his dad is Yao Ming's coach. Don't believe a word of it. Isn't his dad an astronaut? He changed his job because of acrophobia? I still keep some lunar soil that Xiaoxiao gave me. He said his dad's a scientist. Why haven't you inherited from him? Are you the real son of your dad? Wang Mingtu. I've been putting up with you for too long. I'm Jackie Chan! I'm Jet Li! Stop! Jackie Chan, sit down; Jet Li, go back to your seat! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out here! Looking for cars? Come on in. Come, sir. This way. You sure you want to bring in this guy? Remember, never judge a person's purchasing power by his looks. Get the swipe machine ready! Sir, Sir, the first time that I saw this car, I was as excited as you. You must be a pro. You first check the chassis when looking for cars. I know the chassis is awesome but we can't just keep staring at it. Here. The boss sits in the rear. Give it a try. Sir, we offer different types to fit you the best. Ranging from hundred thousands to millions yuan, our cars cover almost all purposes, whether it is for family, business or... Yes! That is the exact expression that I'm looking for. You perfectly illustrates the mind-blowing luxury experience that is beyond the description of words. This car, features the most advanced battery technologies in the world so far. It has the amazing charge efficiency. Indeed amazing. Why is it out of battery? Emm... Sorry, sir. This car might not have been charged. How about we switch a car? Sure. Let me open the door for you. What just happened was a pure accident. The battery in this car undoubtedly has strong cells, high charge rate, and wonderful capacity. Power-off? Why is it dead again? Where has the power gone? Tomorrow is the Parents' Day. You gonna have your mom come again? Your mom did nothing but cracking sunflower seeds. It will be nice if your dad could come. I wanna see your dad. Xiaoxiao, where are you going? Give me back the ball. Look, is he Xiaoxiao's dad? He looks like a homeless Can I hold your hand for a second? Like a homeless I will go with my dad. Wow, you found my school. Here's the ball. What's wrong? Water... Water... Not waterproof. What's wrong with you? Tell me, quick. Freeze. I know you are a robot, and you are not waterproof. Let me ask you. Robots should look like me. You look way too human. Double chin, potbelly, what are these for? The adipose layer cushions the body and protects core parts. What is this? Why do you want it back so badly? Are you grilling me? No, I'm helping to dry you. I want to save you. Only by using it can I go back to 2050. You came from 2050? Scientists are performing a time travel experiment on me. What is it like in 2050? Are there more people or more robots on streets? Can cars fly? What energy sources are used? I don't know either. I was just off from production line and they brought me here. What are you advanced robots able to do? Don't harm me. And I won't harm you. Don't worry. I can't attack humans. You scared me to death. Why don't you tell me earlier? Wow. Here's the thing: Tomorrow is the Parents' Day. If you come with me, I will give you back the ball. How's that? Even my mom has never seen these. You made all these? Yep. My dad studies artificial intelligence, and I might get it from him. This will be the finale project for tomorrow. Can you help to take a look? How to make higher and further flights? I can't help, but I can take a look. You don't know my mom's temper. If she sees this plane, she will throw it away. Every day, she forced me to practice Mathematical Olympiad, English speaking, and ancient poems recital. All those naggings keep going on and on and on. My head is about to explode. Then, why haven't you? Mom. You can't hide a plane that big. Come here. Who's this? He is Xing Yihao. The blind date that Ms. Wang arranged for you. So, you are into cosplay. Which character are you? Son, go play. Mom, I... Play now or never. Let's chat. My bag, please. As you can see, I have been a mom and a dad for all these years. Every now and then, I'll have to handle some liquor. And I don't want him to see. So I thought about hanging out here till I am sober. Now that he has grown up, and the hardest time has passed. Please go and tell Ms. Wang that don't arrange blind dates for me anymore. Besides, a man of this quality is definitely not my thing. What happened to his father? Ms. Wang has not told you about that? They clicked? His dad studies artificial intelligence. He always says, To make dreams come true, you will have to go through failures thousands of times. Five thousand times of failures will carve out his great technological product. However it turned out that only after the fifth try, he passed away. I'm sorry for your loss. He was gone too soon. The boy got it from his dad, fiddling with all these. I was just afraid if he fell behind his school work, and still he is not cut out for that. His dad's dream is to enable machines to learn autonomously. But you are turning you child into a machine that can do nothing but study. Fly higher. Indeed. I can't let my son live in good times but without a good mom. Alright. Hang in there. I'll go home. Ma Daiyu. Two more rounds? Nope, I'm sober now. Boy, let's go home. Take the plane Ok I wish you could come tomorrow. When you enter the school later, try to be cool, OK? Absolutely Look at that! Roasting under this big summer sun, he wears layers without sweating. How frail. He is cosplaying Leon With that speed, I could hit the target before he knows it. Mom. Oh my boy. I was heavy-handed Do not tell your dad about this. Ah, my boy Please stay there, I will come downstairs. Fretting? If I walk like this, you fret, right? Move quickly, or the Parents' Day would be over soon. You already are the center of attention for kids. You don't need to dress up this formal. Though it's the first time we meet, I have already heard a lot about you. You have been through so much hardships these years; I taught them about going to moon, you brought back the lunar soil; I taught them about Cixi, you brought back the luminous pearl; Have you been in contact with the aliens recently? Despite all the hustle-and-bustle, remember to spend more time with your kid. Come on! Come and defense me. Come on, Yao Ming's coach. Three shots in a row. Three shots in a row, can you? Excuse me. Let me introduce myself. I was a former second-level athlete. Sorry for you Come, show around. My dad was a foregone second-level athlete. My dad was a foregone second-level athlete. Come on. Can you do that? Go for it. Have a try There, there. Follow me. Pose like this, Yao Ming's coach. Dad, you scored! You scored! Dad, you scored! Dad. My dad scored! Xiaoxiao's dad is amazing. My dad won! My dad scored! Dad, try another one. I want to eat dumplings. Here. Come on, come on Dad, I'm hungry I'm hungry Dad I'm hungry I am truly hungry It's not yet lunch time. Dad, I'm hungry Ready? We are coming last in the race. Try harder. Wouldn't it be too fast if I do? As long as we race fast. Cheeky wins. Speed up. Straight up your waist. Go, Xiaoxiao! Xiaoxiao! Go, Xiaoxiao! I won! I won! Why don't you smile? I don't know how. I will show you, like this. Teacher, I applied principles of aerodynamics to make a glider. How impressive, Yihang. I'm so proud of you. Thank you for your encouragement. Teacher, I got inspired for making this plane because my dad irons my mom's clothes. No, the opposite. It is powered by steam to provide perpetual fuel. Teacher, cleared for departure. Departure approved. Dad, the power is gone. What can help it fly? Damn, your dad. It's a bionic plane. How wonderful, Weiwei. You see, in science, we must keep our integrity. Although there were ups and downs, you got to advance forward. Understand? I'm sorry, Weiwei's dad. What a coincidence. Mine is bionic too. Yours is not bionic. Yours is bio-release. Bionics eat this? I intended to buy this pigeon to simulate a bionic plane. I didn't expect this. I was simple minded. Time is so limited that I just made a remote control. Go, Da Cheng. Alright. Xiaoxiao, can your stuff fly or not? Yours are just toys. Mine is a real plane. It hovers vertically like an helicopter, and speeds up like a fixed-wing aircraft. Teacher, it combines the merits of both types, and is forged as a new type of aircraft. It's on fire! Don't gather around. Turn off, please Don't gather around. Xiaoxiao's father, please take the kids away It caught fire. The plane was shot down. My plane flew nicely last night. My dad was there too! If you don't believe, ask him. Surely your dad speaks for you. Last night, I didn't actually see that. I couldn't take my eyes off your mother. Even if it flew last night, it fails to do so now, proving that it's just not good enough. You failed. It failed to fly. Why are you here? I brought back the airplane for you. I don't need it. To make dreams come true, you will have to go through failures thousands of times. Five thousand times of failures make a great product like me. You should follow your father's path to move forward. How can you give up your dream after only one failure? At least your dad tried five times. Who gave up dreams? I gave up on you. You could have vouched for me. But, instead, you didn't trust me on one hand, and accused me in front of the crowds on the other. My dad would never do that. Since he's gone, I think about him every day. The reason I did all of these is to figure out why his study is so important for him, even leaving my mom and me behind. Ever since I met you, I thought my dad was back. But I was wrong. You are a cold-blood machine. You don't have feelings at all. Go away. You don't deserve to be my dad. Xing Yihao Xing Yihao Xing Yihao Somebody help! Help! Help me drag him up here! Aren't you leaving? Who told you to come back? Last time I missed the plane's flight. I want to see it before leaving. Did you see it then? I saw... I saw you paddling in the water. It's time for me to go. Please don't go. Could you stay and be my dad? Just between you and me. I'll protect you. I will never let you get close to water. I have to go back to prove that the experiment is a success. But I don't want you to go. If you really need to go, can you take me with you? I will go home right now and pack my stuff, and bring my mom too. If I stay any longer, I will never be able to go. I'm sorry. I missed this time again. But I'm sure it did take off. Xiaoxiao, You can! Could you please stay? Xiaoxiao, help me put it in. Look at this. You guys made him travel to the past. Thus we see the future. I'm here to announce, the first time-travel experiment by mankind was a complete success. Nice to meet you again. Thank you for giving me an unique childhood memory, dad. YOU made me. YOU are my dad. Wow, what a big hand-made rocket! That's my son. Which one? That one. Ready to go? Yes! Go, my boy! Don't hurry. Son, take your time.
