Don. Is the cocaine in the case? No. It isn't, TJ. I'm here to invite you to my birthday party. Consider this to be your final payment. Put your hands where I can see them. No... I said "No" because... TJ forgot to say "Please." Put your hands where I can see them. You credit yourself as being very smart. And because I know that you will seek revenge for this day... I will have to kill you. TJ! There are 36 pressure points in the human body that, when attacked, can cause their death. It's just that I'm caught on the horns of a dilemma. About what? Well... Whom should I kill first? If you kill me... my men won't let you live for long. You will be caught. No, TJ. It's not that it's difficult to catch Don... it's impossible! I want to thank you... for your help on behalf of our government. We know the gang we're looking for... has made Kuala Lumpur as its base. Our Chief Investigating Officer Mr. D'Silva will give you all the details. Firstly, let me tell you about this gang. Verma... When the Soviet Union split up in 1990, several nations were born. Selling arms to terrorists and fundamentalist groups... became a lucrative business for a few people in these countries. One of the new empires built with this money was headed by a man named Boris. Verma... When these empires crumbled under international pressure... Boris disappeared. And when he wasn't found after years of searching... we thought that he was dead. But Boris was not dead. He had gone to India. He invested the money he made... selling arms into drugs. He bought drugs in bulk from Afghanistan, Pakistan and India... and started distributing them in Europe. He had two valuable lieutenants in this business. Vardhaan and Singhania. We don't have any evidence of Vardhaan. And we don't know where he is. What's the reason? This is Singhania. It is rumored that Boris wanted to hand over the business to Vardhaan... but Singhania murdered Boris. Did he kill Vardhaan too? Perhaps, he did. Because there is no trace of Vardhaan after that. And this is Don. He manages Singhania's business here. After receiving all the information, it is clear that... he is the most dangerous... and cunning... criminal. Narang. Mr. Singhania had called me. He wanted to know how the police knows so much... about our operation. It's hard to say. Our men are loyal. Don... what's wrong with you? Did you see Kumar's feet? I didn't like his shoes. Ramesh... Narang... This loyal man... was a police informer. Before you recruit anyone... please... ask him to meet me. But make sure you check his shoes. Kumar. I don't understand anything. How did they find out that he was our informer! You... Vishal Malik. - I am... - DCP D'Silva. I know. How does Don know about something... that only the top Indian officers were aware of. Well... Who told you about it? I'm sorry, Mr. D'Silva. I wasn't pointing a finger at you. Then who were you pointing at? I was pointing at Inspector Verma. He has just joined the force. He is just married. It's quite possible. Mr. Malik... are you sipping coffee or something else? I trust Inspector Verma. Anything else? Yes... I am involved in this investigation, as well. Where are the two of you? If my brother wants a better life today, it's all because of you. Anyways, our hero is in a bad mood. Why? I know a lot about them. If Don suspects that I am leaving him... he will kill me. Ramesh... by the time Don gets to know about this... we will be gone. I know... that after Mom and Dad died... you just wanted me to be happy. But... I wasn't happy. And I think that whatever you did wasn't right. Until today... Ramesh... I always thought of you as reliable. But unfortunately, you didn't think the same of me. You should've told me that you wanted to be out of this... and I would have arranged it for you. Don... I... Don... I... Tell me... I made a mistake. Why are you saying that? That girl... What's her name? Kamini. Kamini! Is your love for Kamini a mistake? Anyway... I am here... to say goodbye. Ramesh... One... one dirty fish can contaminate the pond. But if that pond... is mine... it... is... necessary to kill the fish. Ramesh... People don't leave Don. They leave this world. Kamini... I need to ask you a few questions. What do you want to know? Ramesh was always with Don. Is that true? Yes. Do you remember any particular place that Ramesh often visited? Yes. Tell me. This information can help me to catch Don. It's not my motto to get him caught, officer. Kamini, don't do anything... that could put your life at risk. I don't care whether I live or die now. But the police department wants you to be safe. I'm trying to quit. This camera... this pistol... Why do you need all the security? Because a "Do Not Disturb" sign doesn't work here. What are you thinking? I think... I don't like two types of girls. One, who take too long to succumb to me. The second... who succumb too quickly. And I succumbed too quickly. What's your name? - Sonia. - Sonia. Sonia, you know... it's been only half an hour that we met and here you are, in my room. That's because, when I saw you... I felt that I've been waiting to meet you. Romantic talk bores me, Sonia! Kamini... Where are you? There isn't anything else to wear. I know. Who were you talking to? Well... I was talking to my aunt. She worries needlessly... if I'm slightly late. I can't tell her the truth... about where I am... and who I am with. Bring your aunt along next time. Why are you impatient? Why should I stop when you are here? This heart of mine Is crazy for love His love is like a flame Burning in my heart I am willing To let this flame engulf me You can't escape Its intensity This heart of mine Is crazy for love This heart of mine Is crazy for love My heart always gets What it craves for But my love can take my life If my lover wants it My heart always gets What it craves for But my love can take my life If my lover wants it I gift you my life Take it whenever you want This heart of mine Is crazy for love His love is like a flame Burning in my heart With every moment... There's a storm raging in my heart As the goal I desire Is coming closer With every moment... There's a storm raging in my heart As the goal I desire Is coming closer You will never forget the day Our hearts collided This heart of mine Is crazy for love His love is like a flame Burning in my heart I am willing To let this flame engulf me You can't escape Its intensity This heart of mine Is crazy for love This heart of mine Is crazy for love Your Aunt is outside, along with a bunch of uncles. May I know the reason for this family reunion? Ramesh was my fianc√©. He never told me anything about you. Well... I can understand why he did that. The pistol is empty. Let's go. The police are waiting for you. The police of many countries are waiting for me. But... Sonia... It's not that it's difficult to catch Don... it's impossible! You know this pistol is empty. I know the pistol is empty but... the police don't know that the pistol is empty. Sir... Verma... Put your guns down. Or else... Don, it would be wise to surrender. It'd be wiser for you to move back. I'm asking you this for the last time. Or I'll be forced to... Stop. I just want to get out of here. If you help me, this girl... will be grateful to you all her life. Good night... gentlemen. Listen to me... Don. First, call the lift. Don, I'm unarmed. I can't stop you even if I want to. Let her go. Of course, I will. But let me get out of here. Verma... Who are you? Ask questions later. I need to get out of here first. Put the pistol down. You have no idea who I am. Mr. Narang, the police are here. Wait, Vikram... Let's go. Go. Who is this girl? Roma. She can be useful to us. Or is she... useful? If you had seen her shoot two cops a while ago... you wouldn't be asking me that question. Yes, Vikram. Tell me. I'll be there right away. Let's go, Roma. This girl can do me no harm. So, the police are after you. Why? I'm charged with murder. But as usual, that's not the truth. The charge is true. What was his name? Rajiv. He was my sister's husband. Your sister must have felt terrible. My sister is dead. What do you want from me? Nothing. Mr. Narang said... Narang... Narang wants to start a new trade that is... I like wild cats a lot. What happened? You know what... You will work... with us from today. Jairaj called from India. He wants more cocaine. I know. Did you speak to Jairaj? Yes... I didn't say anything to him but... you are asking for more money... than Mr. Singhania. This deal will bring us a lot of profit. Don't you like such a huge sum? It's not that... but it's not your job... to make the decision. It's Mr. Singhania's job. Singhania makes the decision. I do the work. So what do you do? I don't talk like a child. Such arrogance isn't good. Don't forget that... this business was set up by him. Then tell him to come here and manage it. What's this? The DVD of your wedding! This disc has the information of all our business and contacts. The next time Mr. Singhania is here... you can give it to him. Don, I'm not saying that your intentions are wrong. All I'm saying is... you are moving very fast. To achieve what I intend to... I need to move fast. But turning your friends into enemies for this quest... would be a big mistake. Being my enemy is the biggest mistake... anyone can make. You have forgotten what happened yesterday. If I ever find out that your memory has returned... then remember this too... that the bullets will be real next time. Yes... Verma. Tell me. I just got an information that Don is going to India. When? Day after tomorrow. For a deal with someone named Jairaj. - We'll leave tonight. - Sir. And... find out where we can find Jairaj. Deepak, come here. It's not nice seeing you empty-handed, Jairaj. Where's the money? In the car. Hand over the case to me. Nobody says "please" anymore. As you like it... Here you go! Sir, he's speeding up. Sir, I'm trying to catch up but he's moving extremely fast. Sir, we can't see him anymore. - Get out of the way, damn it! - Get out of the way! Enough of this nonsense. Are you still angry about the girl's death, officer? If you want to shoot me... But don't ever think you can arrest me. All right. This place is so huge that Don could be hiding anywhere. Sure, but for how long? All the highways and stations here must be put under strict surveillance. Our men need to be posted in the hospitals nearby. He won't be able to get out of here even if he wants to. Verma... After the police encounter, no one knows where Don disappeared. Not even the police. I'm afraid that Don... What? I think he truly wishes that Don is dead. What's your problem? Are you jealous of Don because Singhania prefers him to you? Mac... Take her away. I will go on my own. But remember... If what you're saying turns out to be true. I'll hold you responsible for this. Feroz! Come here. I don't know if you remember this. About a year ago... a man had barged into my office... along with a small boy. The boy's parents had mysteriously disappeared... and he had found the boy on the street. Bring me that file. Yes, sir. Vijay... Every moment... Every day... I long for you... O Lord... You must reveal your glory Once again You must return next year Once again You must reveal your glory Once again You must return next year Once again I will wait for you With longing eyes Heed me Heed my plea Come back again Hear your devotee's plea Only when I look upon you Will my heart be at peace Glory to you, O Lord Glory to you, O Lord Glory to you, O Lord Glory to you, O Lord Be it happy times Or days of sorrow Our hearts chant just one name Because of you Life is comfortable You dwell in our whole being Every second... I think of you I am your fan I chant your name in prayer Heed me Heed my plea Come back again Hear your devotee's plea Only when I look upon you Will my heart be at peace Glory to you, O Lord Glory to you, O Lord Glory to you, O Lord Glory to you, O Lord You must reveal your glory Once again You must return next year Once again One, two, three, four... Hail Lord Ganesha's glory! Five, six, seven, eight... Lord Ganesha is with us! Glory to you, O Lord Glory to you, Almighty Glory to you, O Lord Glory to you, Almighty Glory to you, O Lord Glory to you, Almighty Glory to you, O Lord Glory to you, Almighty Is it fresh? Here you go, Deepu. Are you done with the counting? Yes, uncle. How much is it? 3000 rupees including the last three days. Hey! What are you doing? What's happening? My voice has gone hoarse singing for three days. And I got just 3000 rupees! - Don't worry, Uncle Vijay. - What are you saying? We'll make a lot of money during Navaratra. Wow, Deepu. We'll have to make money... I'm always worried about enrolling you into a good school. I just want you to pass high school! But what can I do? There's no money left after rent and food. Hey... don't feel sad. Imagine what your daddy would say if he met me? "You've got my son onto the street!" Isn't that right? You don't know my dad. He'd never ever say that. Really! Then what will he say? Vijay... How does he know my name? Vijay! Oh! I don't want an ice cream. Go away! I'm not selling ice cream! DCP D'Silva. I think I'm smart. And I am smart. But when you are keeping things even from your own department... why are you telling me? About Don... What's he got to do with me? Look at this first. You'll understand everything. This is me! You're joking, aren't you? No. No! You're... not joking! So then? In that case, I think... you want me... to take... Don's place. Yes. You just told me... that Don killed one of your informers. After hearing all this, you want to agree with this job. I hope you understand what I'm saying. DCP D'Silva. Look at Don. He uses his gun without thinking twice... and look at me. I don't know about a gun... but I can't even use a bicycle. Vijay, I know that this job is dangerous. Yes. But if we plan each move carefully... it can be easily done. Sir, I'm not afraid of jumping into this well, but... please tell me. If something happens to me... where will Deepu go? But listen to me... the people I want to catch with your help... find it easiest to get kids, like Deepu, hooked onto drugs. If he gets addicted... to this poison... how will you forgive yourself? Look, Vijay. If you agree... I'll take the responsibility of this boy's education. It will give Deepu the choice to be whatever he wants to be. A doctor, an engineer... or a police officer like me. All this is possible, if you want it. But tell me something... if Don's gang gets to know about me and if I land in a coffin... will Deepu still go to school? I will take care of Deepu's education. I promise. One more question... Well... I am Vijay... and not Don. Only you know about this, right? May God give you a long life but what if you pop it... I mean... Don't worry. Nothing will happen to me. Where's Mom? She's making breakfast. And she sent you as her alarm clock? Well, where's the button to switch this alarm off? No... Just a moment, sir. Sir, is this the password? If you remember, while installing the program, I had told you... that the password recorded in this folder is written in a different way for safety reasons. So your actual password is... Stop! Right here. Stop here. Is anybody there? Who is this? The man who can rescue you. But you will have to do me a small favor. This is a strange way of asking someone for a favor. Tell me something... Isn't it true that Joshi's computer can unlock his safe? I don't know. That means you were lying to Joshi... or are you lying to me! Look... You can think what you want. Why? Is it very suffocating? If you want... we can send your wife Geeta to be with you. All you need to do is one job. There are diamonds worth ten million dollars in Joshi's safe. Get them and I'll release her. I want to talk to Geeta. - Jasjit... - Geeta... This is my fault. Forgive me. But I've got diabetes. The diamond company that Joshi works for... is on the 25th floor of Belcourt Towers. The security on the entire floor... is the kind required to safeguard diamonds worth ten million. We can get you to the roof via the service lift. Take the bag off your shoulder and put it down. You must be wondering how the police got here. Right? I'll tell you. Mrs. Wadia lives in the building across the road. She and her husband quarrel very often. And she comes out to chill in the balcony. Do you what she saw tonight? Inspector D'Silva, please listen to me carefully. I'm being forced to do this. Some people have kidnapped my wife. What's your name? Jasjit. Shinde... Quick. Catch him. Inspector... They will kill my wife! I must go! I'm telling you the truth! May be... But I am not authorized to sympathize with you. Arrest him. Do you know where is Deepu? D'Silva... You have few days to live. Wow! Look at that! He's handsome! You know, sir. Looking at a picture is different. But when it's in front of you... Don is alive, isn't he? Yes. The doctors have kept him in a sedated state. I personally believe that a person like Don has no right to live. But I need him now. Vijay, I want you to study him well... and understand him. Learn his habits and his mannerisms. Everything... I will learn everything. What's the big deal? Let him wake up first. As soon as your work is done, I'll hand him over to the police. I get it. First... all the scars that are on Don's body... need to be replicated on you. Sure. What? Yes. The doctors here can do it without causing any pain. How is that possible? Vijay, this is Dr. Ashok Khilwani. He will take care of you. I'll check everything. What's the matter? Well... I've never heard that a bullet mark on a shoulder or a scar on the head can be made without causing any pain. - Don't be afraid. - What are you saying? I was about to tell you that... I have enrolled Deepu in an International School situated in Malaysia. Well... it must be good. Please stop worrying about Deepu and concentrate on your work. Look... I'll tell you all that I know about Don. Besides that, I've thought of another plan. When Don, that means you... go back to your companion... you'll be ill and wounded. You will have lost your memory. The more you learn about Don's life... the closer I'll get to regaining my memory. You think exactly like the comic book hero, Chacha Chaudhary! You are... I'll tell you a great story. Listen... One day, Chacha Chaudhary took his dog Rocket out for stroll... You want it? - Don never ate a betel nut. - Yes. Don never ate a betel nut. He should've eaten a betel nut. Well, I guess that I must quit too. Fine. Is this a binocular? Neha... Why? Anand... Doctor... It won't be too painful, will it? No, it... What happened, Ashok? Don is admitted in that room. What happened, Neha? It's a heart seizure, doctor. Ashok... You and your team know nothing about this incident. This operation never happened. The success of my plan is linked to this secret. Ashok... It's only a matter of a few days. Where have you seen him? The doctors are saying that he has lost his memory. He doesn't remember anything. Still, we must get him back at any cost. You're right... But how can we do this? They found a Malaysian passport in his car... and they must send Don back. Don't worry, Mr. Singhania. It will be done. Your name is Don. I am Narang. She is Roma. All of us work with you... and you work for Mr. Singhania. I hope you remember this, Mr. Singhania. Despite of all the security, they took Don away! Don's testimony could have exposed the entire crime ring. But what will he tell us when he doesn't remember anything? I don't think he's of any use to them either. Who? Mr. Malik... whoever did this either works for Singhania or for his enemy. - Who are these people? - They are... Vardhaan. Vardhaan... Where is Vardhaan? Have you seen him? Do you know where he's hiding? Do we have a picture of him? Memory isn't something that once lost, can't be regained. Is this... mine? Yes... For me, Don isn't Don... without this. How do I look? You look very dangerous. Mr. Malik... It's been three weeks since Don's escape. Why can't the police catch him? You tell us where he is and we'll go catch him! Look, until we get the right information, or a witness comes forward... we must follow the police procedure. What's in it? Our contacts, bank account numbers and passwords are all recorded in this. You had made it yourself and put it in the safe. Yes. Yes, Vijay. Tell me. Mr. D'Silva... I know enough... about Don. My memory can return now. We must do this with utmost care. I agree. If you can't lose your memory without a reason... then it shouldn't come back without a reason either. I've got a solution for that. Tomorrow, make some excuse... and come to the place that I had mentioned. Who are you waiting for? Maybe... you. Well... You have done... a lot for me. I can't forget that. There's a lot more left to do. You're right. Don! It was like this the other day too. I was in my car... and the police were chasing me. They were shooting at me... And then I... About me... and about all of you. I remember each and everything. Mac... Remembering your friend's names... is one thing. In our business, it's important to remember our enemy's name. Which enemy are you talking about, Narang? Vardhaan or DCP D'Silva? Maybe TJ is the one you were thinking about... or Ramesh, the man who betrayed us all. The people in this world... Have clutched their hearts again I have returned Bringing back with me A lot of excitement Look who's here Back to rule this world Who's got you mesmerized? For whom do you wait With open arms? Who is this charming man? It is me I am Don I stake my life While I gamble with death Neither do I have any regrets Nor do I care About the enemies I make No enemy of mine Will live too long I am very dangerous I am very dangerous Forever cunning Look who's back to win the world over? It is me I am Don These eyes invite me Many women have Wanted me for themselves But these two eyes... With a mere glance Mesmerize me These eyes... Tell me that... They are hiding An intoxicating secret I am getting addicted to them... I am getting addicted to them... And my heart is falling Under its spell Look who's here that has fallen Under this spell? It is me I am Don Yes, Vijay? A deal is being finalized tomorrow at seven o'clock in the morning. If you could come there... I'll make sure to bring the disc with me. I'm sure... it has all the information from the police. Will you be alone? Don't worry. I'll be alone. Mr. Narang, don't you think it's unsafe for Don to be alone? This deal could also be a setup. Don will not be alone. You will go with him. Are you telling me that I can't do this job alone? No. I know that you can do it alone. But Mr. Singhania has personally ordered me to do this. Mr. Narang... Can't Vikram or Mac do this job? Why is it important for Roma to go with Don? Because Mr. Narang knows me very well. And I know... when, where and who to shoot at. Singhania... your time is up. Tomorrow, the disc will be mine and you'll be finished! Tomorrow... This one word separates me from my success. The police will never find out that I have the disc. Because they don't know that I am Vardhaan. And they don't have any evidence about me. Is this a joke? No, it's not! Are you mad? Yes, I got mad... when you killed my brother Ramesh and his fianc√©. Ramesh! Your brother? Yes... And I didn't kill you because... I wanted you to remember why you were being killed! Roma... You don't know this but... I didn't kill your brother. Stop! Stop! That's enough... Look! Look at me. Listen to me carefully. You didn't kill me in all these years. Now listen to the truth. The truth is... The truth is... He... is not Don. How will anyone believe that he is not Don! Besides Vijay and me... only you know the truth. Where is the disc? Sir, here it is. Vijay... I thought that... No, it's okay. This could have happened... to anyone. DCP D'Silva... Your work is done. No... My work isn't done yet. That too will happen. Singhania is coming here. Singhania? Yes, sir. He is coming to Kuala Lumpur for a meeting. I'll inform you about the location as soon as I get to know about it. Vijay... You may have done this for Deepu's sake but... neither me nor the police... will ever forget... this favor. Who is Deepu? Uncle Vijay! Don't you recognize me? How can I not recognize you? My... Deepu! But, honestly... I did wonder... who is this young gentleman running towards me? This new uniform! But uncle, you aren't the same either! What can I say, Deepu? Your Uncle Vijay... had to change himself. But what about the betel nut? I don't have the betel nut. Just a minute. Roma, this is Deepu. And Deepu, this is Aunt Roma. - Uncle, is she your aunt too? - Hey! Is that the way to speak! Vijay... The things that you are doing for this boy... is unbelievable. If anything would have happened to you today... I would never forgive myself. Please forget about it. Anyway... I don't know... if I should be grateful to Don for making it possible to meet you, ma'am. Or I should hate him. Because I wonder... how you can even sit beside a man... who constantly reminds you of your brother's death. I can't punish you for a crime committed by someone else. And please... stop calling me "ma'am." What do I call you then? Jasjit... Jasjit... - How are you, Haatim? - Very well. Long time no see. ...before you came here. Time flies! What brings you here? DCP D'Silva is in this city right now. Yes... I heard about what happened to you... I couldn't do anything for you. But you can now. I want his address, Haatim. What do you plan to do? What time is the meeting? Singhania will be there. Vijay... Perhaps, you don't know who I am. I know you very well. DCP D'Silva. Who are you? Think back! 9th January, Belcourt Towers. Ten million dollars worth of diamonds? No! Well, maybe a bullet could help you sharpen your memory. Hang on! Jasjit? Yes... Jasjit. What do you want? I want to kill you! I hope you won't mind too much! Look, Jasjit... Maybe what happened to you was wrong... I'm a police officer... and it's crucial for me to be somewhere else right now. Or else some big criminals will get away. Let me go! How can I let you go? Look at these faces! One of them is my wife... who is dead because of you. The other one is my innocent son! I don't where he is right now. Look at them! This boy... Deepu... Is he your son? Do you know Deepu? Yes. I know where he is... but I will tell you that, only after I come back. Wrong! You will tell me right now! Jasjit... You can kill me and take your revenge... but you'll never see your son again! I don't hate you as much... as I love my son. Go. I will wait for you to come back. Leave that here. You have to come back, don't you? Night and wine have met We are intoxicated The body and heart Are both ready to melt Celebration surrounds us But I am anxious Why does my heart beat faster? Why does my heart say that... "you fools do not know this yet?" Tonight... Who knows what will happen? What will we gain? What will we lose? Tonight... Who knows what will happen? What will we gain? What will we lose? What will happen in just a few moments? What was always mine Will be mine again The night will decide Who resides in who's heart The decision has been made That I will be victorious You fools don't know this yet Tonight... Who knows what will happen? What will we gain? What will we lose? Tonight... Who knows what will happen? What will we gain? What will we lose? Come, let me tell you something, secretly Soon, the night is going to change Its hue, secretly Then I will take you away with me Secretly Where will you go? Look! Here I am You fools don't know this yet Tonight... Who knows what will happen? What will we gain? What will we lose? Shoot, Mr. Malik! Shoot, Mr. Malik! Malik... What do you think, Verma? Is this man telling the truth that he is not Don? Don is very clever, sir. Claiming that he is Vijay, DCP D'Silva's informer... is surely a plan to escape punishment. Let's do this. Bring Narang and Mac here. Let them hear what he's saying. Perhaps his words... can break them. Mr. Malik, how many times do I need to tell you that I'm not Don! I'm Vijay... DCP D'Silva's informer. If Singhania's men are behind bars today, it's all because of me. And why don't you ask DCP D'Silva who I am? DCP D'Silva is no longer with us. Just a minute! Then... Where's the disc I gave him? What disc? I had given him a disc that had some information about Singhania's contacts and bank accounts. He didn't mention anything about the disc. It must be somewhere... in his apartment or somewhere... on his desk... or... Mr. Malik! If I were Don... how would I know that he had this disc? DCP D'Silva's informer has told us quite a lot about you. Now if there is anything, you two would like to say? What are you saying, Mr. Malik? This man is Don. And he is doing what he knows best. What's that? Making a fool out of police officers like you. Verma, take a small team to DCP D'Silva's apartment. If the disc is there... then this man is speaking the truth. He is speaking the truth. He is not Don. Mr. Malik, I'm speaking the truth... I gave the disc to DCP D'Silva. You don't believe me, do you? Don, I gave you a chance. But now, you can't deny the fact that you are Don. Wait. I have another proof... Dr. Ashok Khilwani. He worked on me to make me look like Don. He knows the truth. Mr. Malik... did you talk to the doctor? - He is not alive. - He is not alive? Last month, he and his assistant died in a car accident. Mr. Malik... Please believe me. I'm not Don! The court will decide this matter. Please listen to me. Wait a minute. I'm Vijay, Mr. Malik! I'm not Don, I'm Vijay! Mr. Malik! Please understand this. We heard everything. I am Don. Don. I said that to confuse them. What's happening? Narang. Please make them understand. You are Vijay. But if they attack you here... the police will realize... that you are not Don. So... You think you're smart? Now get ready to die. The punishment for selling drugs in Malaysia... is death. And the court will surely award Don a death sentence. If it doesn't... we'll kill Vijay... in jail. What happened, sir? They say that, till the time we get a date in court... it's not safe to keep these dangerous criminals here. So, what's their intention? They have a high security jail on an island, five miles off the coast. They'll all be flown there tomorrow. Stay there. Don... - Hey buddy... - Look at that. - Give it to me. - How did you do that? Here you go. Congratulations, Jasjit. The information on this disc... is like winning a lottery. I know a man... who can get you... a lot of money for this disc. Jasjit... DCP D'Silva said that he knew where Deepu was. Perhaps... the buyer we find... may have known DCP D'Silva? Haatim... If he can lead me to Deepu, I'll let him have all that money. So, you have this disc. The work will be done. Malik... What happened, sir? Who was that? An incident on board forced the pilot to make an emergency landing. Don has escaped! Thank God, you're okay. I'm not okay! Vijay... I know the truth. The truth? Why will the police believe you, Roma? Only the disc can prove my innocence now. We'll get the disc. The man who stole the disc... cannot be honest enough to return it to the police. He will try to sell it. Just a minute, Roma. Singhania has an agent here... who keeps him informed about the cops and our enemies. I think he can help us. Try to... get in touch with him. What if you get caught? The police are looking for you. But where can I go? I have that covered. Where is Ramesh's place? Right here. Move. Wait. Let's go. Come on. Who are you? What do you want? What should I tell you? I just know that we are in big trouble... and we need to be here for a while, that's all. It's not a police affair, right? Should we tell them? Uncle... It's a police affair and... a love affair too! Well! I get it now. You've run away? No, uncle. We haven't run away... I've been kidnapped! That's great! Where can we witness a love story like this, nowadays? Come this way. Come, ma'am. Sit down. Uncle... Here you go, sir. Bhang! Bhang? It's Mahashivratri today. It is a holy offering to Shiva. Drink! Oh, the Lord will bless you for drinking his favorite brew! You should also try it. No. You can drink it too. It's all right, brother! Go away. Honestly speaking, uncle. If I had listened to my mother... when I was a boy... I wouldn't have to suffer like this. Why? What did she say? When I never listened to her, how can I tell you what she said! If you're done, can we leave, please? Leave! But where do we go? D'Silva! DCP D'Silva! You set up a good way to get me up there before you left. Wow! Sir! Betel nut. Hey, buddy! I don't want it! Eat it... It's from Benaras. Really? But Don never eats a betel nut. Don... who's that? Don... who's that? Hey! Don means me. It means Vijay. Vijay means Don. And... - Betel nut! - Betel nut! I didn't understand a thing. How do I tell you, brother? The plight I am in Tell us Tell us I set out to eat halvah And ended up burning my mouth! Come on, buddy What can I say? How can I explain? I'm in a bad situation... It's hard to escape It's like a violent storm! It's like a raging wind! I had to... Run for my life! A long and winding... Chase has been on! Day and night, I've been awake... Running helter skelter Sometimes this way! Sometimes that way! Sometimes this way! Sometimes that way! I ran here I ran there! Then you gave me this betel nut And I'm back! Eating a betel nut from Benaras... Eating a betel nut from Benaras... Unlocked my benumbed brain Eating a betel nut from Benaras... Unlocked my benumbed brain Now watch the things I'll do To straighten up everyone This boy... This boy... This boy from the banks of the Ganges! This boy... This boy from the banks of the Ganges! Eating a betel nut from Benaras... Unlocked my benumbed brain I've been cursed! To be caught up in this maze My life is in limbo... I'm at the hangman's mercy I'm so innocent So honest and simple I'm so innocent So honest and simple I don't know how I ended up Amid this educated lot With a sweetened knife... With a sweetened knife They've slit my throat This boy from the banks of the Ganges! This boy from the banks of the Ganges! Eating a betel nut from Benaras... Unlocked my benumbed brain A lovely lass, unique and desirable... Her enrapturing charm turns all heads... Wherever she goes... And her body sparkles Like precious stones Her dazzling eyes carry A world of dreams... Her lips, youth's nectar A flirtatious swagger in her walk... Sprinkles the air with her Sandalwood-scented body Her looks sets your heart aflame Her face is radiant Her eyes are like the eyes of a gazelle Her face is radiant Her eyes are like the eyes of a gazelle She is beautiful... As sweet as honey A beautiful maiden... Has fallen for me A sweetened skewer... Has pierced my heart So bright and fair She's a spicy lass So bright and fair She's a spicy lass A fighting spirit to match She stole my heart Now that I have her love...

This boy from the banks of the Ganges! This boy from the banks of the Ganges! There's a buyer for the disc here. Yes, he's ready to pay in dollars. You should speak to him. We have Deepu. If you want to see him alive, bring the disc... Jasjit... If you want to see your son alive... please bring that disc at five o'clock to the mentioned location. Jasjit. Jasjit. Haatim Qureshi? May I come inside? Who are you? I've nothing personal against you. But if you don't hand over the disc to me... I'll be forced to... change my mind about you. What disc? The disc that you wanted to sell to Roma. Do you remember? The disc is with my friend, Jasjit. And where is your friend, Jasjit? Where's the disc? Where's Deepu? Deepu will come. Call me when he is here. You have my cell phone number. Jasjit... You are always punctual. D'Silva? No. Vardhaan. Vardhaan? - But you are... - Dead. Right? If a man can keep the police in the dark for years... he can also create a fake accident whenever he wants. Malik... You're very cunning. Now I want the disc. Please give it to me. Now I get it! I know why the police didn't find the diamonds in that basement. I recognize that ring. You think... I brought the disc with me! Remember? That night, you had asked me the same question! It will help in recognizing your son. Deepu... Vardhaan... If anything happens to Deepu... I don't enjoy bloodshed. All I want is... the disc. All right. You'll get it. Jasjit here. Bring the disc. My man will reach here at seven o'clock. You and your son... will remain as my guests until then. Take him away. Kill them when you get the disc! Are you okay, son? Deepu... Listen to me carefully. Our life is safe... until they keep getting what they want. - But daddy, at seven o'clock... - Nothing will happen at seven 'clock. Nobody is going to come. That phone call was to buy us some time. I'm scared, Daddy. Don't worry, my son. I'm with you now. Nothing will happen to you. Nothing will happen to you. Yes, Mr. Vardhaan. Nobody has come so far. Okay. Find them. Where are you, daddy? Keep it down! Just a minute. Let me check. They must be hiding here. Keep looking. Only he knows where the disc is. Daddy... Uncle Vijay... This is Uncle Vijay. He took care of me when you were away. Uncle Vijay, this is my Daddy. Take it. Vijay... I don't know where Deepu would have been without you. It's okay, Jasjit. Whatever I did for him... Deepu is a lovable boy. Anyway, why do you need this disc? The only way I'll be out of the mess... is going to be with this disc... and your testimony. I don't understand. Your testimony will prove... that this disc was with DCP D'Silva. DCP D'Silva? Yes. He was the only one in the police department... who knew that he is not Don, but Vijay. But after he died... He is not dead! His real name is Vardhaan. And I met him, just a little while ago. No! No. This can't happen. I mean... your eyes must have deceived you. No, I have not been deceived. DCP D'Silva is Vardhaan. He made me... like Don. And he obtained the disc... he also gave me a chance to kill Singhania. He then faked his own death... and I died as Don. DCP D'Silva... Vardhaan! You've played a big move! But he must never have thought... that I'd steal the disc. Give the disc to Vardhaan. Vijay! What are you saying? Yes, Roma. A final meeting with DCP D'Silva... is very important. Today will be the last day of Vijay's life. I've reached the place you told me to. I'm alone. Buy a ticket from the counter. There's a bridge on level one... come there. And yes... don't forget the money... or you'll have to buy the ticket again. You seem to be in a hurry. Now where do I go? Throw the bag down. I can see you, Jasjit... but I don't see the disc. You'll get what you want. Throw it. Where's the disc? Poor DCP D'Silva! You! What are you doing here? I should be asking you that! - What do you want? - A few answers. This is no time for interviews. Alright. Here's the second reason. I'm going to kill you today. Do you have the guts to shoot? You've trained me well. What will you gain by killing me? There are some things in which profit and loss don't matter. And... they just have to be done. But how will you prove your innocence, if you kill me? Only I know your real identity. Perhaps that disc can be of some use to me. You have the disc? No. It was my love for you that dragged me here! Give me the disc. I'm ready to send you to any corner of the world. Think about it. You must be exhausted running from the police! Not as much as from thinking over and over... why you betrayed me? What betrayal? This is the real world. You think Singhania asked me before seizing Boris' entire empire? I created the entire business with my intelligence. And I can get it back, by using people like you. All right. I betrayed you. Happy? Feeling better? There's time. Join me. You will gain from it... and so will I. Don't make this mistake. Hand him over to us. You will be making a huge mistake if you let me live. Don't listen to him! He is trying to set you up! Remember! Wherever you go... I will find you. And that day will be the last day of your life! Roma... and Deepu... In that case, Vardhaan... I'll be waiting for you. Vijay? You proved your innocence. It wasn't possible without you. Come with me, Roma. I'll see you at the hospital. Vijay! Even I like wild cats a lot. I like wild cats a lot. Mr. Malik, where's that ambulance going? - Why? What's the matter? - He is Don! "I like wild cats a lot." Don had said that to me. He had whispered it in my ears. If he is Vijay, how did he know this? The doctors have kept him in a sedated state. All the scars that are on Don's body... need to be replicated on you. Sure. What? I was about to tell you... I have enrolled Deepu in an International School situated in Malaysia. When Don, that means you... go back to your companions... you will be ill and wounded. You will have lost your memory. The more you learn about Don's life... The closer I'll get to regaining my memory. You think exactly like the comic book hero, Chacha Chaudhary! Weren't you trying to quit it? What else do you want me to quit? I've quit everything. Except you. I thought that you would get caught today... or that I'd lose you. You are afraid... of Roma. - What about the disc that the police... - That's fake. It had nothing in it. Now I rule Asia's underworld. And if anyone is looking for me... always remember this... It's not that it's difficult to catch Don...
