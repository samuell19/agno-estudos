I think women can do anything. Well, I mean, just because they can, doesn't mean they should, right? Think about women fixing cars, driving a taxi, installing some drywall. - Why not? - No. Look, trust me. A girl like you, you don't really want this. - A girl like me? - Mm-hm. I mean, I want all my options available so I can decide for myself. Ah, Miss Independent. That's right. - That's me. - I love it. Mm... - Come here. - Hm... Oh, mm... Except you're sitting here, eating my food, enjoying my view. By choice. Mm, I chose you to join me. - I chose to make you notice me. - Ah, mm-mm. - That is not your choice, Sabina. - Mm. That is God's gift to you. Gosh... But don't you think it's sort of what you do with those gifts that really matters? Mmm. - Every one of us. - Mm? Men, women. We all just wanna fulfill our potential, live our heart's desires. That's the kind of world I wanna live in. Ah. Well, my world is me making millions with you by my side. Hm? It's just that I'm so good at so many things. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Like what? - Well... - Hm? At my job, it's actually considered a huge advantage to be a woman. Hm. Yeah, if you're beautiful, nothing else is really expected of you. And if you're not, you're pretty much rendered invisible. - And in my line of work, - Mm... invisibility, low expectations... they come in very handy. - I don't speak Portuguese. - I know. Yeah, that's it. - Did you know... - What? That it takes men an additional seven seconds to perceive a woman as a threat compared to a man. Isn't that wild? - Who are you? - Who, me? I'm just the decoy, stud. - How many? - Nine! Send the lot. You stole aid money from women and children and refugees! It's called embezzlement! "Embezzlement"? That's fancy. - You must be the accountant. - Who are you? Open the safe. Oh, baby, baby, you swiped right! I'm your girlfriend now! Everything on the bottom row. Let's go. You're not cut out for this. I recommend a new line of work. Bosley! Evening, Angels. Well, all this looks very promising. Outstanding. But what about Australian Jonny? Ta-da! - Oh, you're gonna regret this. - Yeah. I was gonna give you the world. The thing is, is you just talk way too much. You're super clingy and come on way too strong. You are the most incredible woman - I've ever met. - I know. So that's four months' surveillance, two countries and the most embarrassing date I have ever been on in my life. - Are we good? - I will address this to the U.S. Justice Department, along with, uh, all your new friends here. - We're good to go. - Sweet. I'm out of here, man. I'm gonna take a week off, party my ass off on a Thai beach. Jane, you should give it a shot: beaches, letting someone play with your, uh... I have fun in my own ways. Oh. Cool. You sharpen your samurai swords at night? Cosplay Catwoman? I'd actually pay to see that. Occasionally eat gluten at night and feel... That was fun. So who were they? You were in the presence of Angels. But the question is, Jonny... who are you? Hey, Ingrid. You are late. Mr. Fleming is waiting. Oh, wasn't the meeting set for 9? Yes, 9 a.m. is when the meeting starts, which is exactly now. Have you ever spent time with him? Mr. Brok? No, of course not. He had me over to his château, which is in France. And we were sitting there, and I'm asking him, I said, "Mr. Brok, have you ever heard of Humphry Davy?" - And he says, "No." - Oh. I say, "Have you ever heard of Joseph Swan or Alexander Lodygin?" "No clue." So I say, "Okay. Uh, what about Thomas Edison?" "Well, of course. Who hasn't? He invented the light bulb." - Right? But guess what? - Uh... So did those other three guys. Before Edison. But Edison was first to market. Do you see my point? We have a product that will revolutionize the power industry. But we have to be first. The time is now. And that's what I told Mr. Brok, and he agrees with me. Obviously. - I... - Elena, thank you for coming in. I love how this conversation went. Technically, I haven't said anything. Let's not get caught in a game of who said what. Mr. Fleming, I know how important Calisto is, okay? I'm the lead programmer on it. It's my baby. - Yeah. - But as I wrote in my report, right now there is a possibility for the harmonic range to be reversed. We both know how dangerous that could be. Well, I mean, you don't know what I know. Heh. Y-you know Julio? The second engineer? He's actually still in hospital after a brain seizure, and he was only partially exposed during a test. Allegedly. Allegedly. And Julio was an idiot. All I need is root access and time to permanently fix the flaw in the blockchain so it will stay safe... Ingrid, can I get a cappuccino? Okay. I read your report. I've had others read your report. We just simply disagree with you. Has Mr. Brok read my report? I think that if he read... Let me be crystal clear here. We have developed Calisto for five years, and we are going to market. It is safe and it is ready, and that's what we're telling Mr. Brok. And you are telling Mr. Brok nothing. Look, Elena, you're much too smart to keep pushing this forward, aren't you? Good. - I knew who Humphry Davy was. - Good for you. - You dropped something. - Oh, no. That's not mine. Well, I don't litter, so it must be yours. You might need it. Bosley, 001. You old codger. You really thought we were gonna let you just sneak away quietly? You didn't have to. It's not just me. Surprise! Surprise! - Hey! Bonjour. - Buenos días, señor. - Buenos días. - Gang's all here. We all wanted to wish you a happy retirement. Thank you, Bosley. - And you, sir. - Bosley. Bosley. Thank you. - You! - You've had one hell of a run. It deserves to be celebrated. I even put together a little walk down memory lane. - Shall we? Ha, ha! - Oh, no, no. Here it comes. Oh, yeah! Ha, ha! - Fresh-faced Oxford graduate. - Yeah! - Oh, Lord. - I dug deep. Look at that. That's not a disguise. You clearly had a lot of fun over the years. You know, life was good in those days. Where did you get that suit? Monte Carlo. It really happened. There's the proof. Well, when you opened the European offices, you took the Townsend Agency international. None of us would be here without you. - Yes. - Especially me. Thank you. Well, I'm very touched. Thank you. All of you. Say a few words. Come on, speech, Bosley. Speech! - Oh, no. - Speech, speech, speech! Speech, speech, speech! Uh... Well, frankly, I am overwhelmed. I'm grateful... for all the work that we have done together. And, you know, Charlie wasn't sure that we could replicate the success that he had here in California. - But we made it work... - That's right. ...in a world that was really not ready for the Angels. For 40 years, I recruited them, I trained them... and I'm so very proud of them. Bosleys... - you keep them safe. - Will do. - Hear, hear. - We will, my friend. And so for me, as Charlie said, time to make an exit stage left. Wha... Ah, speaking of Charlie... Hello, Bosley. Hello, Charlie. If you look around this room, old friend, you'll see the men and women who will carry your legacy into the future. Your leadership and commitment is unparalleled. We owe you a debt we cannot repay. So instead, we got you a watch. - A watch? - Yes. - Oh! - Thank you, Charlie. Enjoy your retirement. You deserve it. A toast! You really like to party. It's the day drinking. That's what I like the most. You're not bad either. To Bosley. - To Bosley! - To all of you. ♪ This speech is my recital I think it's very vital ♪ ♪ To rock a rhyme, that's right On time, "It's Tricky" is... ♪ Thank you. That's it. Please move.

Mr. Brok, you have set the highest standards for innovation. I believe that I, along with a little help from my team, have met that challenge. Today, I instructed the Hamburg power utility to disconnect this building from the electrical grid. But we are far from powerless. Mr. Brok, would you grant us root access? Hello, Alexander. Root access granted. Calisto, turn on the lights. Calisto, pair with sister devices. Calisto, full power. Brok Industries can power the world. So you went with rare-earth magnetics in the end? Ah, yes. Inside a cyanide crystal matrix. - It's kyanite, but... - Kyanite. - Um, may I? - Please. You delivered on the safety protocols? Oh, absolutely. Calisto only talks with electrical circuitry. The current never touches people, pets, plants. It's smart, and it's safe. Although, uh, in the spirit of full disclosure, I should mention one small thing. It can be manufactured in pastel colors for the ladies. You... Ah, well, this is it. We can bring clean energy to everyone. Sustainably. Calisto is the future. And I am holding the future in my hands, finally. Good work, guys. Good work. Come on, let's celebrate. Drinks in the bar! Keep your form. Block. One, two. Let's take this one off. Make it tighter. Okay. Thanks. I'm just gonna kill it. D'accord, d'accord. I'm ready for a new assignment. Listen, I've set a meeting with a new client. A corporate whistle-blower. Putting a team together. - A... A team? - Yes. Hey, Bosley. - You wanted to see me, right? - Ah, yes. Oh, hey. You're the former MI6 ninja. Is it June? Oh, Jane. Oh, Jane. Jane. Not the month. Sabrina? Sabina. It's Italian. Oh, are you Italian? No. I... Maybe... We have a situation in Hamburg, a new client. Hamburg. Interestingly, not where hamburgers were invented. That was in Frankfurt, where frankfurters were not invented, which... - I don't think that this is... - I'm sorry. I'm vegetarian. Thank you very much. But I recall hearing you two worked well together in Rio. I recall her pushing me off a roof. I recall it was time to go. Heh. That makes sense. Who's the client? Follow me. - Elena? - Hi. Welcome. Uh, Mr. Bosley? - Just Bosley. - Thank you for seeing me. Um... - Would you like anything? - Uh, espresso, bitte. Merci, ça va. Espresso. COS perimeter check. "COS"? I have less than no idea what that means, but you are good up here. I would say, the coast is clear. Yes, exactly. I have thought about this a lot. All we have to do is get it to Mr. Brok. And I have tried to contact him. Well, it takes a lot to come forward, and I appreciate your courage. You sure you wanna take this risk? Yeah. Okay, we can help you. - It's just getting out of hand. - Stop it, you're so cute. I gotta get a dog. I can't sleep at night, knowing and not being allowed to do or say anything about it. I can fix it, but I just need the opportunity. I believe you. Were you able to get the evidence? All my reports, all my data. Your check, sir. Was that the signal? - Elena... - What's happening? You need to go to the ladies' room. - No, I'm fine. Thank you. - Quickly. Hey, what's happening? Jane? Now! Hello... Oh, shit! Shit! Ah! Shit, shit, shit! That's my gun. Sabina! Hurry! - Go! - Go! Yeah! Evac the client! That's what I was gonna say! Whoa! What's going on? - Oh, God. You're not a waitress? - No. I'm Jane. Nice to meet you. - Did you bring the big gun? - In the back. - Can you move your feet? - Oh, sure. Mm-hm. Oh, do you know how to use that? Oh, my God! Is he shooting at us?! - Hold on, ladies. - Whoa! Whoa! Is that a tank? Oh, my God. Where'd he go? Where'd he go? - I think we lost him! - Bit much for just this girl, no? Who is this chick? Who am I?! Who are you?! Who is he? And why is he shooting at us? Keep it steady. Oh, my God. I'm gonna die. Oh, no! He's back! Oh, my God! Oh, shit! Merde! Stay low. Stay low. - Do a J-turn on my mark. - Ready. Now! Bosley. Stay down! Jane! Hey, I said, stay down! Hey! Stop moving! Sandwich? It's tuna. Unless it's cheese, and it's not good. How about you? You hungry? Charlie sends love, Angels. Who is she? Who is she? Hey, she's in shock, and she smells like puke. Who are you? - I'm Bosley. - Bosley? Bosley's a rank in our organization. It's like a lieutenant. The real name of the man you met was Edgar Dessange. Edgar. Jane, I'm really sorry. - I know how much he meant to you. - Oh, I don't need a hug. Well, I do. He was my friend too. Hugs work. Okay, let's get you cleaned up. Come on. Is that a stolen car? Okay. Bosley, 342. Open Safe House 6. Boz, who else knew we were meeting with Elena in Hamburg? Well, protocol would be not to tell anyone. Why do you ask? Well, Bosley... Edgar thought... Okay, you didn't see this guy. He was a pro, and he brought a lot of firepower for such an easy target. Yeah, he was so extra, right? I could take that girl out with a flyswatter. He rocks up in this urban assault vehicle. So we're thinking what? He was... Maybe she was being watched... but what if we are? - And by who? - Hey, you guys. All cleaned up. - Feeling better? - Yes, thank you. I'm kind of getting this, you know. You guys are like lady spies and... I just need you to explain who this guy is - and why was he shooting at you. - Oh, you. - He was shooting at you. - Jane. At me? - Oh, God. - Hey. - Okay. - Just have some tea. The shooter's a ghost. Facial recognition's popped him in a few places over the years but no name, no record, nothing. He's got friends in high places. - I'm gonna kill him. - I'm obliged to remind you, Charlie frowns on revenge, Jane. So, Ms. Houghlin, your file says you are a systems engineer on the Calisto project. Uh, you know about Calisto? We know about a lot of things. That you graduated top of your class at MIT, you take Krav Maga, you ride your bike to work. You think yellow is one of your colors when, in fact, it's no one's. That you could be dating more if you played up the cheekbones in your online profile pictures. What we don't know is why someone wants you dead. I know it can be fixed. Let's take this one step at a time. There's a flaw in the system. What's the flaw? Calisto can be weaponized. I mean, I can fix it. But right now, any decent hacker, curious or criminal enough, could turn Calisto into an EMP on the human body. An electromagnetic pulse. A brain seizure, essentially. - Yes. - See? I know stuff. It disrupts the neural networks and looks like a stroke or an aneurysm. So it can be used without a trace of evidence. A perfect assassination machine. Yeah. And it can be triggered remotely across the network that I created. Dope. See, that is what you can do - if you pay attention in school. - Who knows about this? I filed a report after it almost killed my colleague during a security test, but I think it was buried. My report, not my colleague. No. Julio is fine. He, uh... He just can't speak or see color anymore. It's not in production yet? No, we're behind schedule, but there are six prototypes in the Brok facility vault, plus the one at my lab that I was using to program the fix, which... Let's get those prototypes out of there. Uh, I'm sorry. Can we just hit pause for a second, please? Does your company have a website with an employee directory with photos? Yes, but Brok Industries is equipped with insane security. - There's no way... - There we go. Do you think she still has security clearance? If she doesn't, we'll know the threat comes from within, so either way... - We get the information we need. - No, no, no. No, no. - Ooh! - No. - No, no, no. - I... Huh. Hm... - Bowl cuts. - Bowl cuts. Bowl cuts. Bowl cuts. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Just trying to get to work, Ralph. Well, I gotta do my job too. Okay. - New look, huh? - Mm-hm. I like it a lot. Aren't you holding people up, Ralph? Well... you have yourself a good day. And don't... Don't forget to smile, yeah? What? How...? How did you even get in the...? Oh, God. What did you do to Pradeep? Pradeep Prasad. Nothing. Pradeep's fine. I nabbed his ID card from the gym this morning. Hi. Bye. - Hi. - Hi. And Sven? I compressed his carotid and deoxygenated his brain stem. What? Well, that sounds painful. Yeah, it's like taking a nap. You smell burnt toast, then everything goes dark. Hey, don't worry, he's gonna wake up. Heh, unless he doesn't. - What...? - We should go. If we're in the building when they do their sweep, we're going to German prison. Hm, and then it's schnitzel. All the time. Not such a bad deal, actually. Sabina, you get Calisto from the vault. Elena, you get the prototype from your lab. I'll keep security distracted. Okay. You ready? Yeah. High five. Girl power. Oh. Thank you. No puking. Buggy piece of shit. Whoa... No. - Boz, you with us? - I'm here. What do you got? Calisto's gone. It's not here. Someone beat us to it. The plot thickens. Can you get an ID? There we go. Some guy. Peter Fleming. Let's see what Elena comes back with. Hold up. We might have another problem. Your boy Pradeep just showed up. Pradeep didn't spin? But he signed up for the Groupon and everything. Well, he's here. - Ralph? - Yeah? We've got Pradeep Prasad here. The system says he's in the building. Yeah, there's a glitch. The computer thinks Elena Houghlin is... Right now, I'm sending you an image of Elena Houghlin. Get it to all our guys. I want her - detained for questioning. - Yes. She's in her lab. Let's go. And here comes the cavalry. The heat is assembling, ladies. Oh, they know. All right, meet me at the pickup. Sabina? This one's real hard. I need you to exhibit some attention-seeking behavior. I have so many ideas. Houghlin? Where is she? - Where is she? - I don't know. - Wait, wait, wait. - What? - Now I got her. - Where? Here. Eleven? Guys, she's on 11. Level 11, women's restroom. Hi. Uh, who are you? Shh. Sit down. Hands where I can see them. Are you with Health and Safety? God, these things are impossible to open. Um, you're really not supposed to be touching things in here unless you're supposed to be touching things in here. You put your mouth on it. Twenty billion bacteria reside in the human mouth. You're adorable. Jane? Jane, is that you flirting? Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey! Oh, come on. You ready? Hey! Hey! - Sorry! - Hey! Oh, my God! Get back here! Who has eyes on her? She set a fire on four. We are following her to three. - Let's go, guys! Come on. - Three? She was on 11. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! What did you...? - Hold this. - Okay. Oh, that's... That's not you. No. - Hold this. - Okay. Can you unzip me? Yeah, yeah. Uh... Sorry. Bye. - You don't want your...? - Keep it! - Hello? - Hey, Susan. Mr. Fleming would like you in the lab right away. - I'll be right there. - Okay. Thanks. - Did you see her? - Yes. Not on-screen. With your eyes! - You go there, you go there. Now! - Okay! I'm out. I'm out. - Main lobby. I see her! - Where?! Lobby level. Lobby level! Let's go, guys. Come on! Put your hands where I can see them. Get on the ground! Now! Let me see your hands! - Do it! - What for? I don't know. I don't know! Ah! I don't know what for. What are you looking for? Ah! Sorry, Susan. "Susan Olsen." Put all the exits on lockdown. Sweep from the bottom up. Jane. I got it. The unit's gone. We need to go. Someone beat us to it. Are you kidding? They were stolen? - Oh, no, no, no! - Oh! - Oh! - God! Any ideas? Is there another way out? Wait, wait. I can hack this. Turn it into an EMP, overload the electronics in the door. Won't that kill us in the process? It's short proximity. We should be okay if we keep our distance. - How far? - Uh... Here is far enough, I guess. You guess? Do scientists usually guess? Of course. It's the first step in the scientific method. Hypothesis. Calisto, short-range power burst. Okay, it's powering up. It's powering up. This should work. - Ralph. - No. God. - I have time. - No. - I have to. I have to. - No. No. Stay here! Ralph? Ralph. Get over here now. - There you are. - Ralph, it's about to blow. I can't stop it. Get over here. You think I'm gonna listen to you? - Ralph, come! Get over here now! - Put hands where I can see them! Let's get out of here. Do we need that? - No, it's useless now. - Then leave it. Move it or lose it, ladies. Let's go. We gotta go. Come on, come on. Get in. Do you think Ralph's gonna be okay? Oh, yeah. I'm sure he's fine. - He seemed fine, right? - Yeah. I'm sure... I'm sure he's okay. I'm sure he's fine. Oh, well, that's a shame. Obviously, this is a disappointing setback, but we have time. Do you know what? Just get John on the phone. Now. Well, then wake him up. Everything all right? Can I have your phone? Bosley, 342. Welcome to the Berlin outpost of the Townsend Agency. Is there food? I'm starving. All women are starving all the time. - Mi chico. - Here they are. Welcome back. Mi amor, como estas? - Very bien. - Good. - Cool. - Well... Hey. You owe me a burpee now, okay? - Hey. Bombay sister. How are you? - Master. Good to see you. - This is Elena. - Pleasure to meet you. - Saint. - Wow. Wow. You have this beautiful energy. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Oh, Jesus. - Oh, wait, what? - Oh, my God. Yeah, um... - Oh, no. I would love to apply a firm touch to your back. - Do you consent? - Yeah, sure. Okay. Just let me try to find this. - Oh! Oh. - Oh, yeah. - Oh. - Good? Oh, yeah, yeah. Amazing. Displaced rib. Very common. If you ever need additional adjustments, I'm here for you. The Saint takes care of our health and well-being. - Keeps us in fighting shape - Yeah. Well, I try. He feeds our mind, body and soul. Oh, should we take a moment to remember Edgar? I prepared a mini feast to honor our beautiful friend. I got Pecorino Nero, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Manchego, - and, of course... - Thanks. - He loved Brie. - Yeah. - Ah! And wine. - Especially wine. Wow, I thought you guys were gonna serve, like, bean sprouts and wheatgrass. Eating is all about the intention you put into your meal. If you honor the cow, the cheese is gonna be good for you. By the way, I understand the circumstances that brought you here have been stressful. - So stressful. - If you ever need to talk, I'm a licensed psychotherapist. Wow. I can really see why you guys call him... - The Saint. - Yes. Okay. - Oh, electrolyte-enhanced water? - Mm, fine. Oh, and also try this. It's really good for your breath. - Oh, thank you. - Good. I sent the ID of the last person to access the vault through our search system, ran every CCTV and security cam in Hamburg. Fleming. That's my... That's the guy that buried my report. - Hm. - Look. There. He was at the airport five hours ago. - So he's left Germany. - With the case. He knows exactly what Calisto can do. He knows what it's worth on the black market. If he's selling it, he'd want you out of the way. - I'm broadening the search. - I'm sorry. Fleming tried to have me killed? Maybe. Maybe at the direction of a buyer. Bad guys don't like loose ends, you made a fancy new toy... But I worked for him. I mean... he flirted with me. Oh, honey. A man can love you and want you dead. Ha, not me. There was a gunfight at my wedding. - Wait, you're married? - No. I was the better shot. All right. I need cheese. "Cheese." Is that a code for something? Yes. It's code for "I'm 40 and single, and I have a cheese-size hole in my soul to fill." I also have vegan ice cream for your soul. You really know what I need. I should have just gone around Fleming and not followed some stupid chain of command. Gone directly to Brok. But, no, I just rolled over. You're probably the last people that would know what that feels like. I grew up with major abandonment issues. It led to some pretty self-sabotaging behavior, which landed me in various institutional facilities. Charlie bailed me out. And if it wasn't for Charlie... I'd probably be dead or back in prison, so I feel you. I pretty much grew up on the corner of powerless and ashamed. Wait. You grew up on Park Avenue. Aren't you an heiress? More money, more problems. So, what about you? How did Charlie find you? Jane is former MI6. Youngest recruit ever. You worked for British intelligence? She said "former." I also followed the rules. The chain of command didn't work out so well for me either. Ralph's dead. I killed Ralph. I'm... I'm a murderer. - No. - No, no, no. Collateral damage. I wouldn't take that on. The point is, if Calisto falls in the wrong hands... I mean, we have to get it back before it hurts more people. Well, now's our chance. Mr. Fleming just cleared passport control in Istanbul. - Oh, no. - No. What's your problem with Istanbul? I got food poisoning from undercooked lamb and yogurt sauce I left out, but then I got hungry. - What about you? - Not that. Will you excuse us? We'll be right back. I wanna be sure that assassin stays away from us. We should keep this quiet until we know who all the players are. We don't know what this Calisto is or who wants it, so let's play it safe. What about Ralph-killer in there? Take her to the closet, gear her up. And if anybody asks, we're going to Brazil. Okay. Istanbul. What about Elena Houghlin? I think you know what to do. I took it apart. Nothing. No tracker. It's not emitting any signals. What had you worried? To be honest, I don't know. A feeling. Something in the bones. Hmph. Old habits. Perhaps it's simply that you miss the job. We all get old, my friend. Retirement is not a death sentence. Says the man who refuses to retire. Mm, come on. What? Something in the bones, indeed. Who would do this to you? Someone who knows I'm on to her. Thank you. Look at this. This is the closet of my dreams. And I just get to take whatever I want? - Borrow. - Oh. Is that an actual rule? Okay. So you wanna start with a protective base layer. I recommend a beaded camisole. Yeah? Oh. Some kind of polymer material. Uh, bulletproof, composite body armor. It was originally developed as a protective layer for spacecraft. Yeah. And it's a bra that doesn't dig. Progress. How we doing down here? Ah, we're still in the first closet. There's another closet? Hm. Armory open. Jane, I wanna show you something. - Whoa. - Come on, check it out. - Here, try these on. - Oh, thank you. Why? What do they do? Whoa! What do they do? Whoa. Huh. You're younger than I thought. I've lived hard. Think you can put that MIT degree to use - with something like this? - What is it? Universal Interface. Lets you hack into almost anything. Mm-mm, not almost anything. Everything. - So here's the new baby. - What's that? High-velocity rifle, customized to fire tranquilizer darts. The load: nonlethal, fast-acting, very potent. Jane, you have a new cuddle buddy. Oh, Jesus. Shall we fit Elena with comms? I think so. Oh, that in-ear radio thing you guys have? Ah, even better. It's a subdermal transmitter. Works through bone conduction. See? So I'm getting a tattoo? Uh, no. Tattoos are earned by Angels over time. You'll get a less permanent version. Yeah, comms are concealed in the link. As long as you have it on, you can hear us. Cool. Hey, can I take these mints? No. Avoid the mints. Actually, let's just stop the touching around here. - You know, some of this blows up. - Oh. This place is amazing. It's the crossroads of the world. Danger and money. We need to figure out where Mr. Fleming's meeting his buyer and get Calisto back before it becomes every bad guy's favorite new weapon. - Like suitcase nukes. - Pet tigers. - Jet Skis. - Sea-Doos. Cars that go fast really furiously. So how do we find him? Well, we're off the agency's grid here, so... How do we find him? We hit the streets. We go old-school. We sling some bills. We get violent. I feel like a tiger today, maybe a leopard. But either way, I am down to get wild. I might have a contact here. An asset from when I was with MI6. Uh, "might" as in? As in she definitely lives here, and she definitely hates me. Practice your English? - Good morning. - Good morning. Well done. - Candy! - Candy. Still spoiling the local kids? You. Get away from me. Fatima, wait. Please, just talk to me. Talk to someone else. I can't get involved with you again. Fatima, please wait. I waited for you already. Remember?
