DIARY TO MY FATHER AND MOTHER A FILM BY Dad... FEATURING WRITTEN BY MUSIC COMPOSED BY CINEMATOGRAPHER DIRECTED BY Budapest, 23 October 1956 We want freedom! We want freedom! We want freedom! We want freedom! Hello! Hello! Russkies go home! Russkies go home! Russkies go home! Russkies go home! Lift it up! That's it! We'll make it there! Closer! Closer! Pull it! Pull it! Lorand Eotvos University of Science We demand the election of a new State Assembly representative! Go ahead! Go ahead! That's right! Throw me the rope! Fetch it! That's it! (Choir sings the Hungarian Anthem) Long live liberty! Long live liberty! Hooray! Hooray! Moscow speaking here: a report by TASS. Budapest, 24 October. Last night illegal reactionary organisations made an attempt at launching a counter- revolution in Budapest against the people's administration. This turn of events was a long time coming since foreign reactionary forces consciously fired up the people's enemies to revolt against lawful order. By tonight all enemy action was neutralised. The attempts of counter- revolutionaries at recruiting new followers in Debrecen and other cities were foiled. Drink a bit. Hey, drink. I don't want it. Comrade, why are you coming back every day? The others have understood that the situation is dire! Remain calm! Stop jesting with me. Quit pushing me! At least tell me something. I have a right to go home! What's happening there? - Answer me, can't you hear? - Quit yelling. This will not end well. Be glad that you're over here in safety. Do you know how many comrades pray at home, wishing to be over in Moscow? Just wait till we clean house there. Then you may go home. I want to go home now! Let me go home! I have a right to go! I must go home! Let me go home! That's where I have to be, can't you understand? I want to go home! Comrade Szenes, I do hope we're leaving to Moscow. For the time being, it'll be Czechoslovakia. As far as I know, comrade. (shouting in Russian) Take the other one! Comrade Egri, I regret to say there's no room left. I don't get it. What don't you get, comrade, there's no room! Open it! Open it! The Russians are going home! They're going home, understand? Going home! The Russians are going home! The Russians are going home! - We won! - We won! Thank you. Let's drink on this. I was rooting for you so hard... Not only for you, but Hungarians in general. Cheers. All will be fine from now on. Imre Nagy speaking, the President of the Ministry Council of the Hungarian People's Republic. Early morning the Soviet troops launched an attack against our capital, with the apparent motive of toppling the lawful democratic Hungarian government. Our troops are engaging them. The government is in place, in agreement with the country's people and public opinion. At last they are here. Peace will return soon. (speaking German) A report by TASS on 5 November: this morning the forces of the reactionary system were defeated in Hungary. Imre Nagy's government which cleaned the way ahead of reactionary forces and counterrevolution, fell apart and ceased to function. The Fascist bands hiding in some buildings were successfully defeated. Stop with the sour face! We saw it plainly that it's a counterrevolution, that Fascist bands were in hiding amongst your people. - Katya, please, stay quiet! - What is it, truth hurts? It's not easy to face the truth. Natasha, are you saying this? You of all people? Face yourself. You're the lover of a rich, old Party functionary... Your parents live in poverty in Siberia. And you are whoring yourself at orgies. Shut your mouth! And you? Why do you feel compelled to lie all your life? That your father disappeared during the war, and was not arrested in 1938. And you're willing to believe that he was a traitor. And you're ashamed of him. Shut your hole! I never believed you! You're just a Hungarian! Why do you need to lie and keep secrets all the time?! Why can't you just think? Why are you all scared?! Are we lying then? Are the Moscow papers and radio lying? Take care of yourself... You're ungrateful, like your entire nation. - Good day, comrades. - Good day. - Good day. - Good day. Comrade Ambassador: I'd like to hand you the verdict of the Hungarian Fellowship students of Moscow. In it, we vehemently condemn the Hungarian counterrevolution, and we demand strict countermeasures. Thank you comrades, I shall forward this to the Central Committee. Comrades, it's a great honour that the Party asks you to return home: you're in great demand there right now. - Have a good trip, comrade. - Thank you, comrade. - Have a good trip, comrade. - Thank you. Thanks to your mother's influence, I was able to arrange that you go home after your exams. - Thank you very much. - Here it is. Have a good trip, comrade. Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... - Who's this? - Juli. Is that you? Come in then. Don't you remember me, my Juli? I used to live in your house during the war. In the studio, don't you remember? Do you still remember your father, your mother? Aunt Vera... where is grandmother? She died. We were queuing for bread on Lenin Avenue... Someone ran across the street and there were shots. Your grandmother was hit. Poor soul lived on for one more day. She was really expecting you. I wanted to come home, but they wouldn't let me. Was it the Russians who killed grandmother? Yes, the Russians. They shot my flat apart as well. I promised your grandmother that I'll wait for you here. Magda is afraid. She's still hiding. Why did we never meet before? Because Magda hates me. I've met with your grandmother in secret. Because I wasn't a communist. Only my husband was. - Did that get you in trouble? - No. I wasn't taken because I have a medical file saying that I'm insane. My husband is a major communist martyr. Executed by Horthy's lot. Vera, grandmother loved the Russians. My father visited them to teach them. And it all boils down to them killing us? Your father was a splendid horseman. Even the Kirgiz folks respected him. He gathered rocks for his sculptures and I painted. - Don't you remember? - I remember the mountains. Go ahead and cry... Many people are crying here. What is happening in this town? In this country? Well... ...really strange things are happening here. Ibolya, fetch us coffee and cognac from someplace. Let us drink on Juli's return. We had a fight last year, do you remember? I thought about it a lot. You accused me of settling for less. Well, let me show you something. Here, watch this. Take a good look at it. - Did you record this? - Yes. Tanks... I have found Janos... ...Shows are being held in the cinema venues. I am jotting this down in our car that's pulling away. A maiden is looking for a husband, the vendors are beggars... Hide away, I'll do this. - Is that you? - Yes. Come in. Come in. I told you, don't come to Magda's apartment... I'm being followed. I need to hide away the photocopier along with the materials. - They've begun the arrests. - Sit down. I'm fearing for you, you must not be harmed. Fret not, you know that I'm “insane”. I'm scared, Vera. What will happen in this country? Nagy Imre and his group were dragged away, no one knows where, and quilt-coated national guards show up everywhere: Russians, soldiers, Russians!.. I'm not fearing for myself but for the people who had still some hope left, but now it's nothing, nothing. Calm down, calm down, calm down... Juli has arrived. She wants to talk to you. Zdrasvuyte! Are the comrades quite content now over there? We're so grateful for their fraternal support! Don't hurt Juli! She has nothing do with this. Nothing to do with it, huh? If she does use her wits, she must've realised that no one dodges responsibility! That's right, comrade, thinking won't harm you! Janos... I need to talk to you. Alright, visit me later, we'll talk. Well, God be with you, ladies. Madame... “The world lasts a single day”... You... “Our life is but a single kiss”... “Who knows what awaits us”... “Who knows what we'll wake up to tomorrow”... “Today the sky laughs at us, today your mouth and two arms invite me for a kiss”... “My heart is yours, I don't care about that aching tomorrow”... Don't leave because they'll arrest you, sleep here. I can't, I must go, I'm expected. Janos, stay here! Janos, don't go! Relax, Juli, we'll meet soon enough. Take care of each other. Wait a minute. Read this! See you. - I'm going after him. - Take care of yourself. Take very good care. - We'll throw today! - Who is 'we'? - Me or Sanyi. - You go to hell! You ain't a commander, give it here! Alright, here. Listen up, curfew is on in a few, we need to be quick: once you threw it away, you dash into cover at once, understand me? Understood. It's 9:45 now, let's go! We're off. Stop there! Where are you going? Get out of the way! Are you guys crazy?! This doesn't make sense at all! Stop there, don't you hear me?! They shoot everything to bits! This is no game! Listen to me. At least you should be smarter than this, you moron! What's your problem? Do you want to send these kids to death?! You must live on! Very well, we will live on. Live on, but not like you! You rat!! Come on already! The Russkies are here, come on! Come, come! Give it here! Shut up, I'm throwing it! Die, all of you!! Sonny... Sonny... Good Lord... You shouldn't have... Why did you do this? Sonny... - Juli, is that you? - I'd like to talk to Magda. Sit down there. Come on here... Magda. Sit down. Magda, are you ill? She has a good reason. She was close to be hanged on a street lamp. But now we'll sweep trash away! What do you want of her? Are you hiding out here on Liberty Hill? Waiting for a chance to have your revenge?! Janos is not hiding... Sooner or later he'll also be arrested. Look at all the hate welling up in you two! Get out of here! Here, read this. Do you still speak Russian? Certificate: a verdict by the Supreme Court of the USSR. Laszlo Kovacs, condemned to death in September 1938 according to Paragraph 10, is now rehabilitated. Moscow, 1956. My father was innocent. And where are the rest who you removed? Get out of here now... go ahead, out!! Magda! What are you doing?! Put that gun down! You mustn't do something like that... Let that gun go... Hey, let it go! Good. Come. - This late? Are you daft?! - Forgive me. Is Janos home? This isn't Moscow, this is Budapest! - Kisses. - Hello. He didn't catch a sleep for days. Go inside and wake him. Go on! He'll leave again at daybreak. It would be better if he'd disappear. He's going to be hurt. How would you know that? Believe what you want! What does she want here? I think she's in love with Janos. You shouldn't have let her leave. There's a curfew! - Identification. - Here it is. - What do you want?! - You're coming with us. What do you want? Leave me alone! - Get in there! - I won't! Leave me alone! I'm not going! Let me go! Help!! - Shut up! - Let me go! - Be quiet already! - I don't want it! Get in! Okay. The bastards! Sit down! Quit walking around! - What did they do to you? - Shut up! - I demand a hearing right now! - You'll get one soon. Bring water quick, hurry! Put your head here. - Please stop crying. - I can't take this... - Auntie... - Leave my son alone! I can't take this... I can't take this... Please calm down. Don't cry. My son is innocent! Don't hurt him... Don't humiliate yourself in front of them... My son is innocent! - Please don't cry! - But he is innocent! - Auntie... - My son is innocent! Please calm down. Do not cry. I can't take this! - He is innocent... - Don't cry. Come! Off you go! Get a move on! Get inside! Damned secret police bastard! Cut it out! Get in! You shut your mouth! Get in! You bastard, you! Why didn't we leave back in October? Relax, we did nothing wrong. They'll let us go. “I set forth from my wonderful homeland?” I set forth from my wonderful homeland, from famed little Hungary. I looked back halfway, tears flowed down my face. My dinner is sad, my supper is sad, each and every of my hours is unhappy... (shouts in Russian) I'm looking at the starry sky... Shut up! You all shut up your mouth! Right now! - Cut it out! - Don't you understand? Shut up!! You too! - Why are you beating him?! - Why, don't you like it? No! Shut up! Stand up, back up, move it! Fuck your mother... Let's stop tiring one another, little girl. Why are you taking photos? Who are you working for? You know it is forbidden. Please understand already. I'm taking them for myself. It is my profession. Comrade colonel, they've arrived. Alright. Are you collecting these for your album?! - Who did you meet last night? - I was at my relatives. There's a curfew in effect. Statarium! (speaks in Russian) - Who did you fight with? - I'm not fighting. Just taking photographs. Who are those on the stills? - Faces. - What faces? (speaking in Russian) Stupid. He's with me. Get your stuff and scram! - All the best to you. - And to you, rat! - Damn traitor! - Shut your mouth! - Traitor!! - Shut up! Son of a bitch traitor! Goddamned rat! - What's your name? - Juli. - Juli what? - Juli Kovacs. - And you? - Peter Szeredas. Thanks... Cover your face with it. Take a look at that. - Good Lord, what's this? - They must be burying again. Stop here! - What's happening here? - They're exhuming. Are they digging up the dead? Plenty of children were killed during the fights. They were buried in streets and squares. Kid, bring the camera! My little son... My Sanyika... My son... My little son... My Sanyika... My little one... My Sanyika... My little son... Take this away! Take this away, don't you hear me?! Come already! Please come. You mustn't do that, please understand... No... No... Do you still remember? That woman was our Party secretary. They hated each other with Erzsi. Her son fought together with ours. They died together too... Don't! Cut that out! Stop it! Stop yelling, it's our job! Stop that! Really, just stop that! Stop, kid. Alright, calm down. I knew that little boy since he was a baby. Calm down... - Here you go. - Thank you. Who could it be? Wait, I'll take a look. Juli, they are looking for you! They're looking for you. (speaking in Russian) Don't be scared, they cannot do anything to me. (sings in Russian) - Natasha! - My Julika, my dove! How come you're here? When I found out that he's sent to Budapest, I became restless: I wanted to see you. I made it happen. And why did he come here? He arrived with an advising committee. Juli, people went crazy over here! This city is so beautiful, and these damned Fascists shot it to bits! But Natasha, the city was blown to bits by your tanks. It will be best if you return to Moscow as soon as possible. I won't go back. My Julika... My dove... Get real! Natasha, my dove... You don't understand this. Katya was right: you're part of the enemy. Did you meet people over here? Go to hell along with your advisor! You have a great singing voice by the way. You wretch! You hapless wretch! The people who walk in darkness witness a great light. Those who live in the shadow of the land of death wake up to a light... We need to leave, Vera, so we won't be late. The wretched yoke of the people is being broken. All clothes drenched in blood shall be burned. A child is born: a boy is given to us. And his shoulders shall bear all lordship. He shall be called thus: wondrous, strong God, the prince of peace. And his dominion shall stretch afar. God's children knew that it is this divine child who shall win, and not the armed tyrant. My brethren, let us commemorate the victims of the past blood-soaked weeks: they are martyrs and witnesses, let us include them all in our prayers with love. And let us sing our Declaration while thinking of them. Be a patriot of your homeland unwaveringly, oh Hungarian... It is your cradle and shall be your grave one day, nurturing and covering you. In the whole wide world out there... How did Janos decide: won't he pack in? I'm begging to mom in vain to come with us. You're still young, it's easier for you to leave everything behind. Will you leave in the morning? At daybreak: the truck will pick us up at five. - Vera, won't you join us? - I can paint at home fine. Going, always going somewhere... One gets tired of it. They can't tell me anything new anymore. I know how things go. I toiled for 18 years in Siberia, for nothing. Imagine what they'll do with you. Janos, listen to me... Stay put. Siberia... How I used to live the taiga! Dad! Dad, what are we drinking on? What are we drinking on? I don't know. Let us drink on our old companions. Those who survived... And those who are no longer with us. Juli's father and the rest who disappeared in the lagers and the prisons. And finally on those who died here. In these past weeks, days. And we shouldn't leave out ourselves, either! Let's drink on ourselves too! To your health! - To your health! - To your health! You might need this. Don't leave it home. Come on, mom... - Who's that? - Kati Fazekas. Janos... I'm going with you to Vienna. - Imre?.. - Imre, he's joined Kadar's. Did you think everything through? That's all I'm doing for weeks. Juli... Juli! Come outside for a bit. Accompany him to Vienna and try to keep him there so he won't come home. Would you trust Janos on me? I have to give birth. Open up! It's me, Imre! Open it. - Is Kati here? - She is. Call her out. Call her out. Should I go to Vienna? Yes. My Kati, you can't do this to me! Leave me be! Understand, I can't take it anymore. I cut off my parents for you, I stood by your side while you were in prison, but this will never end! You're insane! My Kati, I'm a communist! Go to hell! Come on! Let's go! That's Austria over there! If we make it to the cemetery, we're on Austrian soil! I can't even believe this: all this just 200 kilometers west of Budapest... - 270. - 250! It hardly changed in 20 years: it was and still is an elegant city. I used to stare at shop windows. Like we do now! - Hello, dad! - Hello. - Good day. - Good day. - Did you eat anything? - Yes, it was really fine. Dad, a lady is waiting for you. She's sitting over there. - Password is March. - Janos! Paris... I'll never set foot in that damned country again. My brother was seized on 10 November. He carried a wounded man to the hospital. He was a physician. He was shot to death on the spot. And Imre is actually defending them. Understand that the Americans and Russians came to an agreement: European status quo can't be changed. It doesn't matter at all what they're babbling about in the United Nations: all sacrifices are in vain. What I'm saying is terrible, but do not keep on fighting. Meaning that we can't count on any support and we're out of hope? Back in '54 when I gained my freedom, I was still hoping. In October '56 I was sure we will succeed. And now it's over. The Russians and Americans had both tricked us. - Sir... - Thank you. A small country... great sacrifice. Lots of people will die once again. Yes. Be very careful, all of you. - Your son? - Yes. Thank you, all the best. Dad... Dad, we shouldn't separate. Come with us to Paris. Ildi could come after us too. Stop hurting me, Andras. I wish we were there already! Listen here, you can live in Paris at my friends'. They live in the street where we lived with your mother. With mother... (speaking in German) You intend to make millions happy, but you abandon your own crippled son: what'll happen to him, dad?! You need to leave with Andras. I'll join you later. You stay quiet! You came here because of my father. Did you think of him too when you slept with me?! You knew it already! You know everything about me. I don't want to deny it. Janos... don't go back. Excuse me. Let's turn back! We don't even know which way is Hungary! I know! Because you know everything, huh? It's madness! - Why are you returning? - Because Ildi's waiting! No! She was the one begging me not to let you back! I understand now, so that's why you joined us, you little rat! Magda told us that you'll be killed! There won't be any mercy! That's her business, and this is mine! - They killed my father too! - Stop whining already! For God's sake, get off me, leave me alone! Janos! Wait for me, don't leave me here, hear me?! Janos, come back! Janos! Janos... Father! Why didn't you keep Janos out there? Say something already. Comrade Marosi offers a pragmatic compromise. You know very well that the Labourers' Council is about to be dismantled. All this makes no sense: if we continue to provoke them, we're only useful to the Stalinists. We're responsible for our workers, even the hotheaded ones: we need to hold them back. The Soviet Army is in the country! Only the new Party stands a chance at preserving independence: we must support the new Party and the government! The lawful government has been dragged away. You sold independence on 4 November. You'll also realise this if you're honest enough. Don't bother, Imre, they'll address him in their own way! Are you threatening me? I know that one. I've had the fortune to experience it already. Janos, we pulled through so many things together! You'll pull through this one without me, understand? Get out of here, get out! Go to fucking hell! Finally, this country is now led by true labourers, - workers just like you! - True labourers... The Party can be your party where you can choose your own life: you can trust nothing else but the new Party! The old one was quite enough... You arrested Bali and Racz. They were taken away from the Parliament, how the heck are we supposed to trust them? Comrades, if we don't work, the country will be ruined. The country'll be ruined due to you yapping all day! The Labourers' Council in your factories... ...the principle of counterrevolution... Shut up and go back to the Ministry! Accept the Party's programme! Comrade Kadar intends to cooperate with the Labourers' Councils. Then why does he drag away its leader? - Yep, why was he arrested? - Comrades! - Why were they arrested?! - Calm down already! The government's representative: now you know what to count on. Where is Imre Nagy's government? And why are National Guards standing at the factory? - To end the sabotage actions! - Stop barking, you weasel! - Enough yapping! - Leave him alone! - Sit down on your ass! - Leave me alone! Let me go! Return where you were sent from! You bastard! Sons of bitches! You'll pay dearly for this! Enough talk, let's vote! What's it worth if all of us are sent to prison? We need to seize the country into our hands! The question is, into what hands? People! We chased away Rakosi's lot... - We have a Labourers' Council. - But for how long? We need to defend it!.. Let us break the strike. - No way. - Ahh... I do hope you agree on this. If we accept this betrayal, if we start to argue, sooner or later we'll come to a point where we have to spit into our own eyes. Let us go on with the strike, people. - Well said. - Well said. That way if the truth is uncovered one way, the world will find out that some of us were indeed brave enough to utter that fucking word: NO. No! He is right, we're gonna strike! - Long live the strike! - Let's strike! Damn it! The negative's gone. They can lie whatever they will after this. What are you staring for like that?! Don't you dare suggest that I denounced you! How could I be such a dolt that I showed the material to you of all people! You don't believe me either! What am I supposed to do so none of you cast me as a rat?! My parents croaked there, I didn't go to Moscow on my own will: I was carried there. You were the one shooting the material that shows how many people died, how many of them fought! And are you weaseling out right now? The bastards!! - Forgive me. - You forgive me too. I'm scared. I don't dare to go home. I am sure I've been denounced. I have no one. I don't have anyone either. Don't be mad at me. Who's this? Janos. My father. My lover... I'll tell you one day. You live alone in this huge apartment? No, it's my fester mother's, she's hiding, used to be part of State Security. Janos is also hiding, but from State Security. Andras has left the country. It's a madness that everyone is scred here. They're denouncing one another. What will happen? You're so strange... So are you. New Year's night is approaching. '56 will be over and '57 begins. '57 begins... I just wish all of us would be together. The world is a single day, Our life is a single kiss... Who knows what awaits us, How long will our love last? Today sky laughs at me... - Here, take some. - Thank you. He won't come. He will come. Come... Janos! I'd like to introduce you to Peter. I already know you from footages and photographs. I see, this is less than comforting nowadays. Ildi, this is Juli's friend. I'm glad you invited me. Everyone I love will be here. I also brought Teri, is that alright? Of course. We hooked up with Szanto in the end. His wife emigrated in October, left behind the children too... What about you? Do you have someone? Well, I do and don't. - Sorry. - No worries. Whenever we play tag, I say 'stupid'... - Hello, Magda. - Hello. - Hello, comrade! - Hello. - Hello, Magda. - Hello. Come, comrades, come. I didn't know you'd invite so many guests. It's a surprise. I also have one, I'm moving home. Bring the suitcases into the small room. Hello to all. Do you see who's come? Let's not stay, Janos. No problem, it'll be one funny night. After all, it's New Year's night. What a nice get-together. Good evening. How do you dare coming to my apartment? - Are you provoking me? - Come on, Magda... You cooked up quite a scheme. Look, Magda, it's past 10PM, we'll make it till the morning. I never thought there'll be so many of us, dear Magda. Good evening, may I have your coat? - I think you know each other. - Yes, from Moscow. And in the front door we bumped into... ...a prisoner from Siberia! - Ahh, good evening! - Top of the evening! Dearest, dearest... I kiss your hands. I brought French champagne! But what is this feast? A costume party? I didn't make preparations! I'm so glad... Oh, you... Look there, it's Jozsi, look at this! I got this idea that I should wipe the dust off it: it served me for 18 years, it used to be my tuxedo, in fact it's quite comfy and very warm indeed! You remember it, don't you? I also used to have evening dresses! Look what a fantastic set I own! - I'll make you up with it! - How beautiful! Why are you two so sad? Believe me, I'm also of the opinion that Kadar should be reconciled with Imre Nagy: uncle Imre was always an excellent, pragmatic politician! You're right, the only glitch is that uncle Imre was dragged away by the Russians and we don't know where. - Aren't you bothered by that? - He's bothered by nothing. Nothing. He may be in Siberia for all we know. Not even that his wife is in Vienna. Hatred leads nowhere, we need to learn from historical errors. So that we never again commit them. I see you're becoming the Jolly Joker of this joint! Young man, you should be quiet: you were still a kindergartener when we were already deep into revolution. Well, I was preoccupied with something else then. So let's just drink instead, come on! Come on, come on, come on, go ahead! Your grave errors enabled the counterrevolution. The Party needs new faces. This costume party was a great idea of yours, girls! Okay, lay it down. This belonged to the bourgoisie, and grandma never let us throw it away. Look at all the stuff! Girls, girls, we'll bring these in for the others so they can choose what they wish to wear! We'll dress up the whole entourage! - We need to save this night! - So beautiful! - Let's see this. - Magda's uniform! Nice, huh?! Here, here, clearance sale! Look what we found! Everyone's free to choose a costume! Who wants to be what? Nothing's impossible tonight! Children, you too! I think I'll be a lounge dancer. I'm so fed up with moralising and ideologies. I'm fed up this high. No, this high! We've got it! Hey, watch this, children: a humble lounge dancer is hereby offering his services! Finally a true gentleman! - What do you want to be? - An emigree. And you? Me? I'd finally like to be happy. Comrade Szanto... Good evening... Sweet Jesus, look at all the Russians here! I was so many things already... - Tag, you're it! - I'm gonna catch you! Look at this shoe. I'll take off your boots. Zsofi! - Last one! - It tickles, but it's good! - Take it in! - Little red one. Teri, don't cry. Come on, don't cry. Quickly, paint her lips! Don't you cry... And you? Won't you tell me who you'd like to be? Well, don't you see? Greta Garbo! Love is an illusion, The fairy-like illusion of hearts... Jozsika, may I? You're such a splendid dancer, my Jozsika. Madame! One moment. Won't you ever become a grownup? “This will be our fate, The fate of both of us...” - Janos! - Watch it. Janos! Janos... Janos... Have you seen this? - It's almost midnight! - Bring the glasses, come on! For crying out loud, where is the champagne? Champagne is here! I need a glass too. (Hungarian anthem on the radio) - Happy new year! - Happy new year! - Happy new year! - Happy new year! What kind of a new year we'll be having? Happy new year... for my son. Happy new year... Don't you wish anything for me! Ildi... Quiet! They'll be the ones to imprison you. Listen to me, I got you out of prison once already. If you have yourself locked up again, you are to blame! Come on, guys, don't be pessimistic... - Ildi, calm down. - You shut up! You are to blame for all this. - Why did you call everyone here? - Be more quiet! Stop arguing! Leave me alone! You people are deaf and blind! I don't want to stay here! - Ildi, calm yourself. - You shut up too! Murderers! Bastards! Lowly blackguards! Goddamned killers! What kind of people are you? - I no longer fear you! - Ildi! Rotten bitches! Murderers! Ildi, cut it out! You'll be taken away! - Ildi! - Janos, help out! Come here, Ildi. I think Ildi is right. Ildi is perfectly right! All of us are murderers: not just Stalin or Rakosi, we are all murderers, all of us! - Do you direct this to me? - Yes. - Take it back immediately. - No. No? Repeat it then! We are all murderers, Magda. I also have one of these. Cut it out already. Are you both daft? Open up! Open! I'm going, I'll open it. - What's this ruckus? - Happy new year! Happy new year! Did all the yelling come from this place? Should we take in the whole entourage?! Why can't you stay put at least on New year's eve? Give me your papers. Is everything in order, comrade? Everything is in order. Don't bring trouble on yourselves. We're off, boys. Bence... Try to lay down, stretch your legs. - Have a good sleep. - You'll sleep soon enough. - Go to sleep. - Happy new year. - Good night. - Good night. Bye. Do you remember? (sings in Russian) Shame, shame... why would you be ransacking this apartment? We are a decent, honest lot... - I'm sick, I'm sick... - My daughter... - Mama, you stay behind! - Go to hell! Your own mother is crying for you... Don't come in, don't come in! They're here! They're searching the house! Go to Janos in the factory and tell him to get lost! Go already! - Move it! - Stand by the wall! You too! Stand there! - Hey, what do you want? - Go on, go on! Gabor Hollo! Which one is him? Turn this way. Janos Gergely! Is it you? You bastard! Rat! Let him go! Let him go! Take him! Lousy killers! I don't want to... I don't want to live! She'll feel better soon. I want to die! I don't want to... Alright, push. Good. No! No! No! Comrades, what makes this Mayday so significant for our people, and we may add, even for other countries? On this 1st May celebration we declare loudly both for friends and for foes: our people shall cure the wounds afflicted by the counterrevolution, and are adamant in building a free, independent, socialist Hungary on this soil! Hooray! Hooray! Rise, you prisoners of the land, Rise, you hungry proletar! Victorious days are coming, your shackled days are over! To erase the past for good, Join us, an army of slaves! Earth will fall out of its joints, We are nothing but will become everything! This struggle will be the last, Let us join our forces then, And the world shall be turned international!.. ...fronting the domestic reactionary forces and allied with foreign imperialists, they conspired against the lawful order of the Hungarian People's Republic. They strived to attain their goals by infiltrating into the Labourers' Councils: a characteristic of the subversive work of the conspirators is the way how they continued their undermining even after the Hungarian People undertook the restoration of order led by the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government. Thank you. We should've done a closed trial. Balazs Horvath, rise. On the evening of 5 January you visited Gabor Bona at home and discussed with him the continuation of the strike. Will you admit it? You know it well. You arrested me in the factory afterwards. - Do you admit your guilt? - I am not guilty. Sit down. Janos Gergely, rise. Have you understood the accusation? Yes. - Do you admit your guilt? - Yes. On 27 October you formed the Counterrevolutionary Council with Gabor Bona sitting there. Do you admit this? Yes. I admit it. And I admit that in 1939 I joined the Horthyst police. I performed reconnaisance work for them. Later in 1944 when I resided in France, I came into contact with the American CIA, and the British Intelligence Service. In 1946, thanks to my American contact, I formed... I formed an alliance with the Yugoslav Intelligence service who wanted me to cooperate on industrial espionage tasks. My liasions included Brankov, Rankovich, and listen well, Laszlo Rajk! Since I know that on tomorrow's trial he'll deny it srongly, I'm ready to confess everything here so that I help you who represent lawful order and justice and pursue every possible route to reveal truth! Listen to me! Listen to me to the end! I'm not finished! I continued my conspiratory actions... Janos Gergely, I direct you to reply the question at hand and nothing else... I continued my conspiration even after my 1950 arrest and imprisonment: I fooled the guards systematically to escape my cell and to meet in a forester's hut multiple times with Josip Tito! Silence please! Lead him out! - I will change nothing! - What are you waiting for? - Take him out! - The same folks sit here!.. Goddamned murderers! You are all the same! Take him out already! You're the same as in 1938! In 1948! And '58, and '68! And '78! And '88! And '98! I can't write a diary. I can't even comprehend what is happening around me. Fear and suffering... I'd like to understand people. Magda, Janos, Ildi... Why did my father die at 29 years old? While innocent.... 1...2...3...4... Avenge me! Murderers! 1...2...3... and 4... Long live Hungary! 1...2...3...4... 5...6... Andras... Juli... Magda... Mom... Dad... Ildi... 12... Boys, goodbye to you! Your Honour, I report that I present the prisoner Janos Gergely as you commanded. I understand. - Janos Gergely? - Yes. I inform you of the verdict of the Supreme Court's People's Court Council's verdict: according to this, the People's Court Council condemns Janos Gergely to death. The call for amnesty was rejected. The capital punishment is to be executed. Budapest, 4 September, 1958. I report that the verdict has been executed. - He is deceased. - Thank you. He is deceased. At your service. I think we may leave. Coffee is ready, comrade president. He is deceased. Half an hour later, same place. Take him down. Which one is dad's grave? I don't know. But let's make it this one. Come on!
