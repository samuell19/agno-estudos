Even when joy tastes of hatred I can't laugh anymore Farewell, my pain FEAR OF WATER Nice catch, sergeant. I gave him a warning. It's lame. There's nothing to catch with this weather. And it doesn't help with our quota. That too. Let's also consider no one else was on the road. Correct. Calling car 1. Go on. Car 1 to station, agent Savoie. Put the sergeant on, it's sort of a priority. Surprenant. Listening, Majella. Sergeant, I just got a call from Roméo Richard himself, the mayor of Havre aux Maisons. His daughter Rosalie stayed out all night. We can't file a missing person report before 48 hours. If you say so. Talking about staying out, your daughter Maude was seen with Kevin at the camping and it was quite... Majella, this is not quite relevant so drop it, OK? Are you OK, André? Yes. I'm OK. Hey, André. You're damn pale, are you sick? No, I came to see Elise. That's not my expertise. But you can come over for a drink after work. Bernard, I don't want to impose myself. Come on, it's us. I can't talk to my shrink, since she's my girlfriend. See you later, OK? Great. Bye, Damien. See you next week. Must be the uniform. Can I see you? Sure. Apart from this one, any other panic attack? Swimming class. I took your advice and tried, but ten feet away from the water, I was already shaking. I could see kids diving next to me but my feet were like stuck in cement. I didn't go back. Isn't it the way you felt when Maria left? What do you mean? Your paralysis, your inability to act. Maybe you're afraid of your emotions. Your phobia of water is a fear of letting go, of what you would do if you really listened. If I really listened... The only time I did, I entered the police force. Look where it got me. We're all scared, André. Sometimes, you just need to take a chance and don't think too much. You need to meet someone. I could introduce you to a nurse. We're only separated. I need to think about Maude. Maude is 16, she's not going anywhere. -I don't see her anymore. -See? You need to take care of yourself. Did you keep some for me? No, unfortunately. You're beautiful. Isn't she beautiful? If us two hadn't met, I'd still be a lonely divorcé and she'd be an old spinster. You jerk. It's time I turn you into an admirable woman. Don't you think? -Now is not the time. -Your husband. -Is that a ring...? -An engagement ring. -Yes, mister. -We're getting married. It's... I told you the alarm clock wasn't set properly. -Hugues has played with it. -I haven't. Time to go to bed. -You're not my mum. -Don't start. What's going on? Put you son to bed, please. -Sorry, I didn't sleep well. -Me neither, remember? It's Rosalie Richard. Suicide? If she undressed and tied her hands before jumping. Are you OK? Where is she? I have to avoid looking down. Don't overdo it, it's not candy. Right. Agent Savoie, be careful not to impair the crime scene. What do you think, Bernard? I think she was strangled. Correct. She has bruises on her vagina. Bruises on... Considering the stiffness, she died about 24 hours ago. About 24 hours ago. What should we do? Don't walk everywhere, stay in your tracks or you'll erase the prints. Be methodical. I talked to Montreal crime major. He'll take over. Lieutenant, we haven't even started. It's too big for us. We never had a crime. And it's political. Rosalie! Where is my Rosalie? Mr Richard, you can't stay here. This is a crime scene. I don't give a damn about your crime scene. You can't stop me from seeing her. I repeat, sleepy sailor, 11.45. Can you hear me, Albéni? They're going straight to le Cap Noir. Hurry. The fish. Welcome to the Magdalen Islands. Sgt André Surprenant, agent Geneviève Savoie. Detective Gingras, homicide squad. -You'll be staying... -Take me to the crime scene. Come on. Let's go back to the night of the crime, Mrs Guignon. Like I said, shortly after my man came back from the pub, I heard a car go by. Youngsters often park by the ocean to fool around. Usually, they make a lot of racket, but yesterday, nothing, not a sound. About 20 minutes later, the car left with an awful din. Do you remember what time, roughly? Yes, at 2.40 sharp. I checked the time when I heard the wheels screech. The guy must have struggled to walk back. That's why I know it's not someone from here. It's an outsider for sure. OK, so the crime happened between 2.15 and 2.40 am sharp. Don't walk here. You did an awful good job, guys. -Thank you. -Apart from your boot prints. It's the only entire print out there. I tried to tell them. Luckily you didn't park here, we wouldn't have any tyre prints. Actually, a witness heard a vehicle. Ten year old car, type Chrystler with a V8 according to the wheelbase. The guy weights about 250 pounds and was wearing wellies, size 11,5. It's a beast. But if the killer was carrying the victim, we need to subtract the weight of the victim. Listen André, maybe you should go visit Roméo Richard, let him know we're taking care of his daughter's case. You know what I mean? Your remark on the weight is very relevant, sergeant. It's not technological, it's methodical. What year, do you think? I would say more or less recent. -Tending towards the less recent. -Indeed. -It's not to sell. -Mrs Richard? She's dead. I'm Evangéline Arsenou. Roméo? The police is here. What are you doing here now that she's dead? You had to find her when I called you. I'm truly sorry, but proofs reveal she was already dead when you called. My condolences, Mr Richard. You need to catch the guy who did it. If you don't, he's going to regret the day he was born. I was wondering... When did you realise she was missing? She went to school the day before yesterday and she still wasn't back yesterday morning. At first, I wasn't worried. I called her in the afternoon, but she didn't pick up. Did she often, you know... Sleep somewhere else? She's not a kid anymore, if that's what you're asking. I understand. I have a daughter too, but I can't complain. Any idea where she spent the night? Go check at La Caverne. She spent her nights taking drugs. Or she would go to the mainland and drive around town. -Don't you have to go to work? -What? There's a reason you cut her off. Is that her vehicle? Yes. I bought it for her birthday last year. Before she started acting stupid. Is that her boyfriend? No. He's my nephew. Emmanuel. Can we talk to him? I doubt it. He hung himself last summer. Emmanuel Leblanc? I read the report. His psychiatrist is a friend of mine. The shrink? Maybe you should check the psychos who go see her to find the killer. Is that her as a kid in the cabin? Yes. My boat, le Cap Noir. With my cancer, it could have been Rosalie's. Excellent. Shouldn't we let the others know? They're busy. There's nothing wrong with having the job done. The trunk is locked. But not the door. Door unlocked. Is it plural? Let's say yes. We haven't checked the other door. I'm going to wait. André. Look. Emmanuel Leblanc again. Not that. There's white powder on it. Cocaine, probably. Yes, let's have Montreal technicians examine it. We won't let them hold us responsible. Your methods are not that bad. Should we listen to it? To die as a martyr I feel strong I'm brushing against The quicksand of your body I want to leave the ground Get lost in your guiding eyes And drift Until the sun comes up She was there. With Mélanie Ervy and Stéphane Patten. Is Stéphane Patten Rosalie's boyfriend? No, he's Ervy's boyfriend. Didn't Rosalie have a boyfriend? The little devil was popular. The last one was Julien Cormier. She tried to get him out that night. Have you noticed any drug consumption? What kids do to have fun is none of my business. Unless it's in your bar. You still act like an outsider. It sticks to you. If someone dealt drug in your bar, would you tell me? Listen André, you're the police. Car one to station. Car one to station? Station to car one. Can I help, beautiful sergeant? Do you know a Julien Cormier? The loser. He has a file? No, but everyone knows him. He is presumed to have no current job. I know what he does. Majella... I'm just trying to help. The guy in question lives at Chemin des Chalets. Copy that. Nice gear for someone unemployed. Benefits are high in the islands. Well, well. The islands shock brigade itself. You don't seem to affected by the loss of your girl. Who told you she was my bird? Can we come in? Do you have a warrant? No need for a warrant when you're clean. As you can see, there's nothing to see. It's tobacco. You won't find a thing here. Witnesses say you argued with Rosalie at La Caverne. I said what I had to say and I left. What did you talk about? I wanted to dump her. The rest is personal. What did you do afterwards? I came back here and I watched a movie with Tête Plate. Right, Tête Plate? Yeah. What's the title? Porn Identity. The tart couldn't remember a thing but the cocks she had sucked... OK, we'll manage to find what time it was with the title. Write it down, agent Savoie. Rosalie Richard. Strangled with the same rope than the one around her wrists, with a sailors knot, a bowline to be more precise. Her neck was broken afterwards. Mark of tape on her lips, probably to prevent her from screaming. No blood despite heavy bruises on her anus, which means he sodomised her after she died, thinking she was just unconscious. Penetration of 22 centimetres, the dirty bugger had a big one. No sperm, he had the bad idea of putting a condom, but we should be able to identify the brand with the spermicide. Woollen thread from a handmade jacket, no link with the victim's clothes. The assailant was wearing a blue woollen jacket with fish blood on it. After raping her, he put shells on her body, as if it was a trophy, the typical modus operandi of sexual predators. Excuse me, Sergeant Gingras. Couldn't it be someone who makes it look like it's a sexual predator? I'm curious to hear your theory, sergeant. The assailant acted quickly, it took him 40 minutes max to catch her and leave the crime scene. He didn't really take his time to rape her. The victim has two lethal wounds, as if murdering her was the most important thing. It could be a hate crime or a rejected lover. You're thinking about Cormier? -It could be. -Did you check the case? Not really. Shoe size, weight? 8,5 or 9. And at least 165 pounds. I'm telling you, your suspect is a bad match. We need facts, and according to the facts, the suspect weights 250 pounds, wears 11,5 wellies, likes fishing, has a blue woollen sweater knitted by his mum and a big equipment. We should be able to find him if we bother to search for the inhabitants who have a history of sexual harassment. Is that clear? Sergeant Surprenant, please show us the vehicle. We'll be able to lift fingerprints and possibly identify the suspect. Thank you. Don't go there. -I'm sorry. -No problem. I was taking the trash out when I heard a vehicle leave. What vehicle? A big pick-up truck. It was too far, I couldn't see who it was. I was sure I locked the doors. Why the hell didn't you station an agent nearby to secure the vehicle? I thought in the islands... You may live in a postcard, you have to follow the procedure. Everybody, search the rest. The one who started the fire wanted to erase clues and he might have failed. If we find one clue in this mess, I'll have braces fit in. Do you want my fist in your face? Chill out, Savoie. Calm down, agent Savoie. It's my fault. I'm your superior, I shouldn't have dragged you into my indiscipline. It's not your fault either. It's our first murder case. André. I managed for you not to have a bad evaluation, but maybe you should step backwards for a while. Give the Montreal guy some space. I'm here. You're home early. -Everything OK? -Yes. Did you eat? Some pizza. Excellent. This is Kevin. Nice to meet you. What? Nothing. OK, so... Don't stay out too late. We're not out. Correct. Fuck. Hello, radio of the islands. Regarding Rosalie Richard's murder, Grindstone Island security has issued a statement. They are looking for a big American car. The wanted vehicle could also be stained with mud. According to a woman who lives on Chemin Boudreau, the car would have caused a racket at 10 in the morning. If you have information about this vehicle, please report it to... It's the list of the witnesses for the reconstruction. Excellent. You're not checking it? I trust you. Yes? I know you like date squares so I made you some. Thank you, you're lovely. It's quite bad for braces. Good for me, I don't like sugar. Very good. Nice change. -Did you have something to say? -I can't give you any advice, but it has to be about an inheritance. I wouldn't be surprised if it's the motive. Interesting lead, but you should tell Detective Gingras. without little Rosalie, only two could inherit his beautiful boat. The big Evangéline, who was there before he was a widower. -Majella, I really need... -Albéni Thériault. He steers Le Cap Noir now that Roméo can't. The permit would cost a lot, since the boat apparently doesn't just fish crab. This doesn't come from me. Really? What's his name? Albéni Thériault. Nice catch. We don't sell, go to the warehouse. That's not why I'm here. I have a couple of questions for... Albin... Albéni. Thériault. Right. About Rosalie Richard. I have nothing to do with it. If you need a warrant... And the night of the murder? I was at sea, if that's what you want to know. Were you? What do you fish at night? Fish. All sorts of fish. I thought le Cap Noir only fished crab. You're investigating on Rosalie or my boat? Is the boat still Mr Richard's? No difference. We need to diversify. What will you do when Mr Richard, your boss, retires? I'll do the same. OK, but what if Mrs... Mrs Arsenou inherits the fishing permit? I'll never work for this bitch. Would you have worked for his daughter? It's too late to ask that. Was Rosalie interested in fishing? Enough to know it was her bread. It is a beautiful job. But it's a bit dirty. Alert to car one. Sergeant Surprenant, listening. Over, Majella. Martha Petitpas from l'Etang-des-Caps wants to talk to you. She might have found the crime car. Excellent. Does Gingras know? He's locked himself in and doesn't want to be bothered. Perfect, tell agent Savoie we're out for patrol. It's here. I called you in. I think someone took my car that night. Was it washed? My husband Alcide removed the dirt. The mud surprised me, I hadn't taken it since before the storm. The one who took it has really small legs. The seat was moved forward to the maximum. André. Here, it looks like blood. Correct. It could be anyone. We hang all our keys here, right at the entrance. I didn't hear a thing, I take sleeping pills. The lady psychiatrist prescribed it for my anxiety. Could someone else in this house take it without telling you? No, my husband has a truck and he wouldn't have heard, the basement is soundproof. He spends all night on the Internet. Can we talk to him? He's at work, he's the school janitor. School? Yes, and he's been overwhelmed by what happened to the kid. He knew her, so you can imagine. He wouldn't like us going to his basement. It's just to check if we can hear. I can tell you don't know him. Who's that? I'll close the door. You won't hear a thing. I saw this on TV. What if she comes back? Hold her back. André! You can't do that. Let him go! Alcide Petitpas, you're under arrest for the murder of Rosalie Richard. She was a slut who slept with everyone. No one deserves to die at this age. Not like this. Alcide. Calm down now. You really want to blow the case. You wanted to arrest a suspect behind my back and enter without a warrant. Thanks to my call and the identification of the car, agent Savoie and I thought it was urgent to arrest him, and the operation was a success. The suspect seems to match the assailant's profile. "The suspect seems to match the assailant's profile." You really are a small town officer. Be polite, sergeant. You haven't found the suspect... -You've got the wrong guy. -Excuse me? You've got the wrong guy. Damien Lapierre grew up in foster care in Montreal. Convicted four times for rape before he was 20. The victims were 13 to 17 years' old. His latest victim was tied up and raped repeatedly. That's what we call a modus operandi. Released from prison in 2006, settled in the islands in 2007, next to his ant and uncle, Martha and Alcide Petitpas. Yes indeed. Police! Open up. Try the handle, dammit. All clear. You're in deep shit. Stop. Stop, now! It's not me. I can't even get hard! We couldn't have known. We're a team, I'm to blame as much as you. No. No, I'm... Maybe the reconstruction will show something. Gingras isn't even interested. He's already found his culprit. I have a bit of Scotch left inside. Didn't you say you were tired? No, I'm not tired. Well, if you're not... -I'm sorry. -If you have no choice... Hi, how are you? Good, and you? Am I bothering you? No, I was just going home. Where are you? Now? I'm leaving the station. Do you mind if I call you back? Is someone with you? No, I'm with no one. It's just that I'm in the car. OK, call me back when you have time. OK, bye. I'm staying over at Kevin's. Are you handling things with Maude? Yes, she's finishing her homework and then she'll go to bed. André, I know you have a big investigation... I do. Maybe you can be promoted. Yes, maybe. When you're done, will you come see me in Montreal? So we can talk. Even visit houses together. Everyone deserves a second chance. Yes. It's a good idea. Don't be too late. OK, I promise. Midnight. That's when we arrived with Rosalie. Agent Savoie, you will play Rosalie. Everyone, agent Savoie is playing Rosalie Richard. What did you do? We ordered beers. A tray. Was Rosalie nervous? Different? She was in a good mood. The best since Manu's funeral. Did she take drugs in the car, by any chance? She might have. If Manu was born somewhere else, he would have been famous. -Like Kurt Cobain. He didn't have to die to be listened to. I would have listened to him. He couldn't be reasoned now that he was in love. If we knew who it was, we could find his song book. I know. Cool, I can play his tunes. He wouldn't have died for nothing. Tray. Can you stop serving? It's just a reconstruction. 12.15 am. What are you doing here? I reconstruct, like everyone else. She was on the list. What were you doing with Rosalie Richard? I came to see her briefly and I left, that's all. We'll talk about it at home. 12.30 am. That's when Julien Cormier arrived. Where the hell is Cormier? OK, I'm going to play him. Everyone, I'm Julien Cormier. What did he do? He came up behind Rosalie. Like that? -Yes. -And then? Then he put his arms around her and whispered in her ear. -What about? -Sex, I guess. As usual. Let go! You're going to pay for this. I'll pay you soon. I always pay. She kept on checking the time. And then she left. I didn't see her leave. But since she wasn't coming back and she had left her cell phone here, I took it with me. Did someone see her leave? I did. I went out almost after her. You followed her? I thought she would smoke. Smoke what? A cigarette. You're so finicky, André! And then? There was no one when I came out. Had she been in her car, I would have seen her, so I went back in. Damn it, Platon! A girl died just because you wanted to get high. I didn't kill her, you idiot. I'm talking about the bar. Half of the customers are underage. -They have fake IDs... -I'm not talking about beer. You'd better clean your rat hole or I'll do it, and for good, OK? McCann, send everyone home but check their IDs first. I have things to do. Yes, sergeant. I'm proud of you, André. -Good, I'm not done yet. -What do you mean? Rosalie came here to meet someone she knew. I really don't see her asking Damien Lapierre. At 3, we get in. One... -Two... -André. What? I'm not mad about yesterday night. Excellent, but let's talk about it after work, OK? Three. Geneviève. Does RR remind you of someone? -Rosalie Richard? -Correct. And 3200. -That's it? -No. CN 2K S13. -CN. -2K... Two kilos. S13... Hey, It's private here. CN 2K S13. What does it mean exactly? That it's none of your business. I guess RR stands for Rosalie Richard. It's "Rain, rain, go away". 3200 dollars is good enough for drugs. It's got nothing to do with drugs. Agent Savoie, search the vehicle. Aren't those the keys of a car that burned recently? -Excellent reflex, agent Savoie. -Thanks, sergeant. It's funny. I closed the car and found it open after it burned. A witness saw a truck like yours. The Montreal team is good at identifying tyre marks. You erased your prints after the murder. -Don't blame me for her death. -I'm not stupid, OK? I take you to the station right now if you don't tell me want you wanted to hide from us. Something was mine. The cocaine? Speak! Rosalie was dealing for you and hiding it in her car? She used more than she dealt so you argued in the bar. -You waited outside and did it. -I didn't. OK, I did argue with her, but that's it. She's the mayor's daughter and since he's a fisherman, he always did as he wished. Stop dusting your nose with your friends and pay what you owe me. I'll pay you soon. What are you afraid of? Good, or the teacher will bleed to death. You wouldn't do that. You need me too much, Julien. What does he give you that I don't? Let go! I'll pay you soon. I always pay. She had a nice ass. She would get me jealous with a French teacher. I'm just the son of a fisherman. The name of the teacher? Flaherty. Tell him I'm sending you. What? Nothing. It's just nice to be respected once in a while. Not just once in a while, don't you think? How come we haven't arrested Cormier? To keep him next to me. Small fish always lead to big fish. Where were you at that time? And you? I'm entitled to know what my daughter does at night. I don't ask you anything. Do you mind? You didn't tell me you knew Rosalie Richard. So what? She was selling you drugs? My shrink doesn't give me drugs. But it's not... Do you want to end up like her? No, I don't want to bury myself here. So it's not good enough for you either? Or you suck too much for Montreal. What are you talking about? Mum says you're here because you can't work in the city. I could work anywhere! I came to the islands to give you a better life. Did you? Well, Mum left and I'll go to her. But you have to finish school. Why Montreal? It's full of... Yes, it's full of stuff. It's not my fault if you want nothing. Jacques Flaherty? It's me. She was a big girl. Maybe, but my daughter is about to enter high school... When Rosalie was sulking, it was hard to resist, believe me. What were you doing on Thursday night? The night of the murder. I don't have an alibi if that's what you want to know. I was home, waiting for her. Did you have a date? She was meant to come late in the evening. She told me she had something to take care of, but she never came. When was the last time you saw her? Wednesday morning. After our last night together. What are you doing? Printing a memory. You found Manu's writing in my stuff? Yes. Listen to this. "My thirst is like water Flowing under my skin. A wave lost in your flood. Dying on an island I am the sailor Of useless joys." I remember, I gave him an A for this. "Useless joys". He shouldn't have had to pay the price. Will you ever forget him? Never. He's dead. I want to avenge him. Don't go. When you read his notebook, you'll realise he's a better poet than you, even dead. Manu wrote his songs in a book that he always kept with him. He was my best student. Rosalie loved her cousin. Was she in love? I was competing with a dead guy. For her, Manu would always be young and beautiful. Now, it's Rosalie who will never age. Jot this down. It confirms the Modus Operandi theory. He left his signature on Rosalie Richard. I'm also writing that the shells on her body were dirty and chipped whereas these ones are impeccable. I'm going to search the bedroom. Sergeant. For a sexual predator, it's a bit embarrassing. Yes indeed. We're not going to find the condoms he used in here. Instead of talking bullshit, make yourself useful. Did you know that the culprit was chemically castrated? Who said he was taking them? It can be verified with his therapist. For various reasons, I can't see him as the murderer. Such as? Such as the fact that Rosalie knew her assailant. And Damien Lapierre grew up in Montreal, he doesn't know a thing about knots. He's 6 feet tall and the car was too close... Or you can't take orders on how to do your job. Boss, we've found the jacket. I bet we have a perfect match for the fibres and the wellies. Stop looking, Sherlock. We have enough to get him by the balls. I still want to question his therapist. -Do I have your permission? -No. You don't have my permission. It's an order. Good. Take your time. Hey, André. Congratulations, I heard the news. Thanks. It's a small world. Elise can't believe it. She feels guilty. Actually, I need to talk to her. She's on the boat, her refuge. When things were tough, she was always there. You've got 2 minutes? Are these your wellies? Yes. Where did you get them? At the store. They're ordinary. You knew Rosalie Richard, right? Yes. And so? Did you know her well? She asked me once for a prescription. Did you examine her? I probably did. Why do you ask? I'm just surprised you never told me. Why would I do that? I'm investigating on her murder. I thought you had found this psychopath. Did your relationship go further? What do you mean? I don't know. She was a beautiful girl and you told me things were bad with Elise. It's not because your wife left that... You called her that night? No, I didn't. Then why does your name come up on her cell phone? I never spoke to her, I was on the boat that night. Any idea why she called? I'm a doctor, loads of people call me, including you. -What were you doing that night? -Sleeping. Even better, Elise had an asthma attack. -You can check with her. -What time? 2.30 am. I know because she asked me. Excellent. No hard feelings? Damn you, André. It's the first time you act like a policeman. You really think Damien is innocent? Yes, but I have doubts. It would be such a relief. But I need you to give me his medical file. I'm not allowed, you know. Was he taking his medication? I think he was, there's no sign of a relapse. That's excellent. Were you by any chance up the night of the crime? Yes I was. I had an asthma attack. Around what time? About 2.30 am. Why? Was Bernard up too? I woke him up so he could give me my inhaler. Does it matter? Not really. I was just wondering if maybe you saw or heard the Petitpas' car from your place. No. I would have told you. You also treated Emmanuel Leblanc, right? Yeah. I did what I could. Did you know about his relationship with Rosalie? Manu told me they grew up like brother and sister, but that things got complicated as teenagers. Interesting. And Rosalie never came to your office? No. I met her at Emmanuel's funeral. She was troubled. Aggressive, even. I want to know why. Why did he do that? Rosalie, right? Emmanuel told me about you. What did he tell you that he didn't tell me? Unfortunately, I can't help you with that. What is said in my office stays confidential. It can't be. It can't be. Don't beat yourself up. You can come see me. It would do you good to speak to someone. Why? What did you do to help him? He loved someone else. I know it. You can't hide it from me. He loved you very much. Emmanuel was like a small wounded animal. That's what made him so endearing. You couldn't get too close or he would bite. Rosalie wasn't spared. You're making progress. Why? You're on a boat. On water. Your messages. By the way, you shouldn't leave your car parked anywhere at night. People could talk. -Who is on duty? -No one. Except for the lieutenant, he's out for a death report. Nothing unusual. A delivery guy found the old Langford dead in his lounge. Thanks. Hi, the islands' hospital. Yes. Everybody has left. We're sending it to the lab, but according to the analysis, it's a match. Could you... Listen, about yesterday... Yes? I would like to... -What? -I think we... I think that we should be careful. Yes. I understand. OK, I... Geneviève. Yes? Could you identify all the numbers in there? You still don't think it's Lapierre? Correct. I think you're being stubborn just to piss him off. Could we meet after work tonight? We could check the phone numbers together. I've put the picture with it. No notebook? I'm gonna get that bitch! The bitch? It might be me. If you came home at normal hours and walked properly, you wouldn't bang into things. How dare you? When he dies, you'll just take off. What makes you say it's going to happen here? Because I'm his flesh and blood. You're wasting your time with him. It's better than wasting your life powdering your nose. I'll do what I please with my share. What makes you say you're still on the will? You bitch! Do you know what's in the will of your partner? If the culprit wasn't arrested, I would think I'm a suspect. -You're a nurse at the hospital. -That's how we met. The poor man needed some help. -This is not a crime. -Maybe not. But around here, people still badmouth about it. Did Rosalie call you at the hospital on Thursday? She wasn't in the habit of calling me for no reason. Here again, Surprenant? I thought your investigation was over. I still have a few details to take care of. Albéni told me you came snooping on le Cap Noir. Nice boat. I heard it costs over a million. He has the usufruct? He gives me my share of the catch. Have your been on your boat recently? No need to get there to know Albéni can steer it. You're not very curious. Judging from this, Rosalie was more curious than you. But she wouldn't have been as easy a boss as you. You're mislead, Surprenant. You've got the culprit. Everybody knew Lapierre wasn't normal, except for you. I'm just saying that... Rosalie's death is convenient. Let's say Rosalie heard her drug came from le Cap Noir. She wanted a bigger share of the catch than her father. So Cormier and Thériault have a reason to get rid of her. As well as Evangéline Arsenou. She would inherit. -But she's a woman. -Correct. Maybe she had an accomplice. You can kill for love, too. Flaherty. No, he would have found an alibi. Why can't it just be a sexual crime? I think someone wants to put the blame on Lapierre. Straight off the bat, everybody accused him. Here. Your list. You... I just had some Cherry left. At least it's sweet. You're beautiful. What's going on? Hello? Majella, sorry to call you so early, but the old guy who had a stroke was a Langford, right? It's just because it's you. Cornélius Langford. What was his job? He was retired, but he was the mechanics on le Cap Noir. Thanks. You'd better have a good explanation. He was murdered, that's for sure. I'm listening. He was working on le Cap Noir, the boat of Rosalie's dad. They collect drugs, it can't be a coincidence. Sorry André, but I don't follow. The mayor of Havre aux Maisons? Yes. Can you show me where you found the body? He was lying on his stomach, just here. Struggle marks? André, it's not my first statement. Have you seen how clean the floor is? As if someone had erased all trace. Here she is. Have you found the body? Yes. It's embalmed. -Shit. -But... I have the embalmer's testimony: "Mr Langford had a bruise on his left frontal lobe". It's consistent with my findings. He had a heart attack and fell head first. That's how I found him. Nothing else? Plus a bruise on the back of his neck. This doesn't kill a man. Yes, but it could be a needle mark. We have to do an autopsy. I doubt we learn something. To commit a crime, you need a motive, and I can't see any. André? This. Check this out. I found this picture of le Cap Noir in Rosalie Richard's bedroom. It was taken here. Langford must have given it to her. It proves she was connected. That's right. It's the same angle. You said he was their employee. He could just take a picture of the boat. Because it's a look-out, OK? You see everything from here, you can keep on eye on the ocean to spot coast guards while the boat brings drugs, on the harbour for the police, and if there's a problem, you let the crew know. For me, this is just the picture of a boat. The mayor's boat. The mayor was too sick to deal with it himself. Have you got proof? Not yet, but with a surveillance team, we could... Surprenant, I'm off to Montreal tomorrow with a suspect who almost left a sign saying he's guilty. You can speak as much as you want about your theory. When I write my report, I'll have you work here for a very long time. I might be biased, but I believe you. I know it's hard to believe. The boat is not even centred. But still... Hurry. Emmanuel Leblanc's cabin. We're boiling. Geneviève, go back to the station and compare it with the condom used to rape Rosalie. Also get the file on Emmanuel Leblanc's suicide. Le Cap Noir just killed someone else. Correct. Get out and put your hands up! Cormier confessed. Albéni Thériault is in for drug import. Congratulations, André. -You were right about the drug. -Not only. Thériault might be connected to three murders. Rosalie Richard, Emmanuel Leblanc and Cornélius Langford. I did ask for an autopsy that revealed he was injected a curariform drug. I wouldn't jump to conclusions. Thériault might handle a hook, it's not a needle. But he did attack a police officer. Rosalie Richard was in his way. Cormier was sending her to the mainland to deal drugs, but had she inherited the boat, she would have been the boss. Langford? An embarrassing witness. You still have Emmanuel Leblanc. I admit I haven't found yet, but he might just be an unintentional witness. You'll find something, I trust you. Me too. Here is his file, sergeant. There's a match between the condoms in Emmanuel Leblanc's cabin and the ones used on Rosalie Richard. Hey. Bernard told me I could find you here. I was tidying a bit before cleaning up the dry deck. Can we talk? As always. I was making myself some coffee. Hop in. Why not? I think I solved Rosalie Richard's murder. Did you? Yeah. For once, I trusted myself. It did me some good. I even think that I'm a good officer now. That's good news. I'm happy for you. I don't know, Elise. How long was your relationship with Emmanuel Leblanc? Who told you about it? No one. I was confused, I didn't know what to do. I don't even remember how it started. But Cornélius Langford saw you. He thought it would count for Rosalie, who would inherit le Cap Noir. When Rosalie realised you were the one Emmanuel loved, she wanted you to pay. So you killed her. Come on, you're talking nonsense. I'm not. The day she died, Rosalie called you twice, at the hospital and at your place. You treat Martin Petitpas and Damien Lapierre, you could access their file, their private life, their habits. We both know Damien Lapierre is responsible. He's the perfect culprit. So you took his jacket and wellies and Petitpas' car, but you forgot to push the seat back. And the shells you left on Rosalie were dirty. You should have known Damien cleaned his. And I raped her? With a stick and a condom of the same brand you used with Emmanuel. Bernard can testify, I was with him. Right, the asthma attack. You made sure that Bernard checks the time. You set the time on your alarm to create an alibi, but you made a mistake and it rang 12 hours later, when I was there. Interesting. How did you come up with all this? I saw Hugues wearing Bernard's wellies. I thought a woman could do the same with Lapierre's. And killing Langford with a shot required a doctor. I got the missing clue from him. The picture he gave Rosalie. The answer was on it, but I just saw it. Your boat is next to le Cap Noir. You don't usually park by his cabin. What does it prove? The date and hour on the side. It's the day Emmanuel died. He's holding your hand. It's a duplicate. Good evening, doctor. Rosalie? You're not answering my calls? I told you, you need to make an appointment. So that you fuck me up and I hang myself too? Good riddance, right? I did everything I could to help Manu. But he was sick. Manu wasn't sicker than you and me. Unless loving on old bag like you is a sickness. A lot of patients fall in love with their therapist. But how many therapists sleep with their young patient, doctor? -You don't understand. -No. I don't understand. I would have given him everything. Everything! He was my Manu. My love. With me, he'd still be laughing and writing. But he had to love you. -Rosalie... -No! You'll pay, bitch. I'll never let you forget he died because of you, do you hear me? Never! Well done. You've become a good cop. How did you do it for him? Sleeping pills. Was the suicide note a song from his notebook? I was so intoxicated by him. If you knew how he was like. He could be so radiant and so excessive at the same time. I lost it completely. I wanted to stop but he didn't. He wanted to tell everyone. I couldn't let him destroy it all. People need me. You know how much people need me, André. Do you understand? Tell me you understand. It's OK if you want to study in Montreal. I'll work it out with your mother. -Well done. -Thank you. Good job, André. -André... -Geneviève... You go first. Listen, I have things to take care of. Yes. I understand. But if... Correct. I owe you an apology, Surprenant. What for? Once I've taken care of the paperwork in Montreal, you could stay. How about being a criminal investigator? Thank you. But I think you were right, Gingras. I'm a village officer. I belong here.
