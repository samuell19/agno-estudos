Here I am, boys. Come on, let's show a little spirit. Wake up, Luciano. -"Wake up"? I haven't gone to bed yet. - Come on, Luciano. I'll be right there. See you Monday. Coming to San Remo with us? I'd like to. But I'm working. Come on. Go off sick. Right. And when the doctor from the association checks up, what then? Let's go. Let's see if he lets me pass. No. Milk here, too. Milk everywhere. Milk pays as much as petrol. I hate you, milk. You are a liquid, like wine, but don't get people drunk, like water, and you stink of hospital, Children and baby cheese. Stop, stop here. You must be mad. This place is too expensive. Come on. Leave the fleabags to the yokels. Be careful with your date, Leo. He'll tell us she's Swedish, and has a dowry. - Whisky. - Give me a glass of cold milk. With a double shot in it, on me. Aren't you going to buy me a whisky? Here, have a cigarette instead. As soon as you turn, they rob you. I'm going to the casino, I'm going to get rid of that banknote there. Wait a minute. Let me have my drink first. How would you like your whisky, sir? Straight or with ice? I'll have it with ice. Come on, knock it off, I've already told you I'm from Voghera. No, you're joking. So you're foreign? Come on, Stop joking and buy me a drink. You mean you're thirsty already? Are you coming or not? I'll be there in a little while. We'll wait. Signorina, you must have a dance with me. And why? Give me some mineral water. Why not? Here's why not, you were very rude to me earlier. You have some nerve asking me to dance. Was that you? I didn't recognise you there. I apologise. Don't make me dance with them. Please dance with me. Very well, I accept your apology. Shall we? Under these lights, you glitter like a diamond in a shop on Via Montenapoleone. I really mean it. No one's ever paid me a compliment like that. Are you a jeweller by trade, then? No, I've got a chain of stores, but I'm in the grocery game. What's your name? Professionally, I'm Yvonne, according to the programme here, but actually my name is Candida. Two nice names. Candida reminds me of a washing machine, but it's beautiful. Let me drink something, otherwise the manager will fine me. Why? You are the main attraction. Do you have to make clients drink? I wish. I'm just one of the orchestra singers. Today, with microphones, it's not so difficult. They pay us badly. So we get some money with a share on the empties. On empties? - The empty bottles. - The empty bottles. Especially because it's Saturday night. The manager says not to waste time with stingy people. And especially me, you know, I'm requested a lot. So I am stingy. Come. Ten whiskies for this lady. Ten? One is enough. It's tea they sell for whisky. I don't want you to be cheated because of me. I am not easily cheated. Listen, I ordered a whisky, not tea. Listen, tea is better, otherwise I get drunk. I ordered whisky, I pay for whisky, so they have to give me whisky. Right? You are definitely right. - Shall we dance? - Dance? You've got the right to dance with me till dawn. Mario, put aside the whisky. The air is wonderful at this time. It's nice to work at night and sleep during the day. You know, someday I plan to have a club of my own, with dancers, strippers. - With singers? - Singers too. As long as it's classy. What do you say? Not a bad idea. Stop, this is where I live. - What is it? - Nothing. I'm just miserable, that's all. I can't take it anymore. I do apologise. Out with it. What's up? It's just that a man has come here to bother me. I see him everywhere. There he is. Who is he? His name's Franco. Someone from my town. He got out of prison three weeks ago. He's been hanging around my place to try and get to me. Since he's been in prison, I don't want him any more. He's just a cheap gangster. I know what we'll do then. We'll go along to my hotel. - What about my things? - We'll send a porter around to get them. - Anything to bring to the room? - No, just park the car. Is this your hotel? - Are we going or not? - Where to? - What do you mean? To Milan. - I'm not going. Tell my old man I've got flu. Where did you put the car? - Over there. - And yours? I've lifted another one. By the way, get another along the way. Say, Luciano, will you take care of the hotel bill? - Me? - Lost our last lira. I haven't any money left, and I'm staying here with Yvonne. Let's get out and leave our luggage. - No, no, I'm staying. - And what will you do about money? - I'll find someone who'll give me a loan. - Ask Yvonne. I can't do that. She's my guest. Do you actually like her or is it just a fling? A bit Of both. Ciao, Luciano, and remember, the dairy's waiting. Place a bomb. Is Signorina Pasini staying here? Her first name is Yvonne. Yes. Who's calling? Tell her Signor Franco is here. I need to speak to her urgently. Give me 121. Hello? Signor Franco is here at the desk. The young lady can't see you. Excuse me, may I speak to her? I take it that you're so busy you don't even have time to talk to me. I see. You might have said goodbye when you moved. So you're living at the Grand Hotel and have an old man to pay the bill. You're still a cow, is that clear? Yes, a big cow, and nothing else. What are you saying? So what? Even if I am a crook and have a record... - You can't do that. -...l am still a lot better than you, you're nothing but a whore. Have you gone mad? Get out or I'll have you thrown out. Where do you think you are? - Where do you think you are? - I'll tell you. - Get out. - In a brothel. A thief. Finally. - What is it? - Why? You look annoyed. Tell me. Have you quarrelled with Franco over me? Franco who? I don't even know the man. Let's go. Call the porter, I'm going to settle the bill. I've seen it. It's pricey. I'd like to ask you to wait till next Saturday and keep my watch. It's a present from my mother. I lost all my money in the casino, and I don't want to leave your hotel before having settled the bill. And that of the lady. She called Switzerland many times. With your friends, it's more than 200,000 lire. I don't know if the watch is worth it. I'll add this one, too. It belongs to my fiancée. I don't see the carat. It must not be the first time this has happened with clients who lose at the casino. You're kind. I'll come next Saturday to get them. No later than that. I'm sorry, but you'll have to come with us to the station for a few formalities. My train leaves shortly. I'm on my way to Switzerland. Sorry... I'm going to Switzerland to work, I'm not going for enjoyment. Besides, I'm going to meet my fiancé, who is going with me. Luciano. What is it? It's the police. They want to take me in. - What for? - I don't know. But the train's departing, I've the luggage, I don't know what they want. Porter. In fact, it would be better if you came along, too. Why? To explain things. It's in your own interest. Come on. Let's go. Porter. To tell the truth, it was Franco who smashed that jeweller's window in San Remo. I don't know a thing. What have I got to do with Franco Magni? Don't you live with him at the hotel? I actually left the hotel because Franco Magni gave me a hard time. And besides, my fiancé has nothing to do with outlaws. Absolutely nothing. Take a seat. But watch out if you're not telling the truth. Stand up. Come on, come along. Just have a good look at those two. You told me you saw a man walking past the shop window several times. Have a good look at them. Over there. Now, can you see better? No, it's not them. He was different. All right, boys. You can go. You, come with me. - Ciao, Franco. Good luck. - Keep out of trouble, all right? Thank you. How kind of you. Have you met my fiancé? - Franco Magni. Glad to meet you. - Sorry. Luciano Lutring. Congratulations. Take care of her. Listen, Luciano's not a member of the Cesaroni gang, or any crooked business, understand? Hurry up, the train for Zurich leaves soon. She's a wonderful entertainer... I don't understand. Come on. Don't everybody shout at the same time. Not so much noise? All right. - Let's go. - Let me go. Are you mad, Luciano? The show must go on. Yes, but without you. Come on. Let me go. - Come on, get your coat. - Not like this, Luciano. What do you want with this lady? She's under contract. - I'll pay the fine. Take us to court. - Have you lost your mind? The signorina was supposed to sing in a first-class night club. You cheated her. You can't do this. I gave up everything a month ago to launch your career, and you let yourself be cheated this way. Get out. I'll split the skull of the first one who steps any nearer. Now, clear out. Why can't you go away? Please go and leave me in peace. What is happening to you? You ask me that? it was you that robbed that jeweller in San Remo. Why do you say that? What about this axe you have? I know Franco used to smash jewellers' windows with a slingshot. I wanted someone like you, with your face and your eyes and everything else you've got. But I want someone without a police record. But you're my woman. Here, take this. Wipe your eyes, or else all your mascara will run down your face. Just tell me this car is not a stolen one? Franco, when he drove me, when he took me to my show or we went out, he used his own car. But when you do a job, it's in a stolen car. To travel, you need to have your own car, without any problems. I don't give a damn about this Franco. I'm different. Luciano Lutring. I've stolen cars for ten years. He can't teach me a thing. Then stop the car. That's it. Why? Anybody can fall in love with a fool, but I'm an artist, you know? I sing. What do you sing? You earn 10,000 lire per night. If I don't pull you out of this shit, if I don't open a nightclub, you're a nobody. What do you sing? Go ahead. Sing. Let me hear you sing. - Say, is there a café around here? - Yes, but it's closed. Leave me alone, Luciano. Leave me alone or l... I'll call the police. Luciano, please. I'll call the police. Let me go. - Leave me alone. I've had enough. - Shut up. Stop, I just want to be left alone. - I can't take it anymore, I've had it. - Stop it. Let me go, Luciano. I can't go on like this. Will you shut up. Come on. Let's go. - There they are. - How far? - Getting nearer? - A little. - I'm afraid, slow down. - If I slow down, they'll get us. - Let's pretend we're innocent. - What? My pocket's full of jewels. Give them here. Give them here. Hurry up. Come on. - Here. - All of it. - Give me the axe, Luciano. - Why take the axe? I didn't use it. - They'll suspect you. -It's under your seat. Slow down. Wipe off the sweat. I'll give you a cigarette. They weren't after us. You are so lucky, Luciano. - What are you doing? - I'm going to get the watches. The humidity will make them rust. - Don't be afraid. - You are mad. Come here. Look. Which of these rings do you like best? Come on. - That one there. -It's really nice. Luciano, what are you doing? Be careful. - Let's go. - It'll be all right. Wait here. - How much? -200 francs. Here you are. There you are. Please take it. It's my engagement present. Don't worry, I paid for it. I thought it would make you happy. How much did it cost? 200 francs. The last of our money. Wait a second, I'll slip it on your finger. No, Luciano, that's the wedding ring finger. Sure, because I'm marrying you. But you've got to promise not to keep on nagging me. Luciano, I don't care if you've been telling me lies but you must go back to the dairy. I hate milk as much as I love you. Now we have to set up a family. I promise that after the wedding, I'll stop. I don't really like smashing windows. You might not believe me, but each time, I'm really afraid. - Come on. - I mean it. But you love me anyway, right? If so, then... If it's true that you'll quit, why don't we marry right away? - Here or in Milan? - Here. We can do it now. Come. No, Luciano. I'm not coming. Not with a stolen car. - I'd rather walk. - Walk? Are you insane? Do you think it's nice to get married with a stolen car? What if they arrest us before the ceremony? Let's go by car. It's easier. Come. Don't be afraid. - Honey, what's the matter? - I heard noises... It's nothing. How about a cup of coffee from the bar downstairs? You're my wife now, you know. You're not my mistress to be waited on. Hey, you hurt me. That's your fault. You can't even make a cup of coffee. Get a move on, I've got to go out. I've got to make some money. You promised me you'd stop. First, I want to give you a fur coat. Then, if you like, I'll go back and work in the dairy. GUN SHOP Franco. You're coming with us. Hurry up. I will, as soon as I finish the game. Which game? Come on. Get it over with. Everybody uses buckshots and I've got a cast-iron alibi. When they broke into the gun shop, I was right here with the sergeant. You know, the whistle-blower. That's what they call him. And where is the sergeant now? Right here. Yes, I know him. Listen, this fellow says he was playing here with you yesterday around six. Yes, that's right. Well, if the superintendent wants to see you, where could he find you? I'm here any night around this time. You know, you'd be better off checking in a dairy instead of in a billiard room. What do you mean by that? Nothing. I'm just saying that you might get lucky. Which windows? The one at the balcony and the next one. OK, we'll wait a few minutes to move, just to be positive Colasanti's oar has reached the position. Hello, Luciano? Get away, it's the police. Here they are. Come on. This way. Nothing. It's too heavy to be a violin. Looks as if they've started to go into it quite seriously. At the moment, he can only run away. Call headquarters. Here. Otherwise they might mistake me for a violinist. Come, let's go. Luciano, where are you? - I'm here. On the roof. - What are you doing up there? - I'm hiding. - You might get electrocuted. - They've gone. - They might come back. They're clever. Luciano, be careful. I read in a magazine that electric shocks can make men impotent. - Come on. - I swear. - Check if there is anybody around. - No, it's alright. Come down. - Easy. -ls there more underwear? Why? Did you piss your pants again? - Go pack. - Take this. Are we moving? The rings. Listen to the headlines, "The Sten-gun soloist." Who is he? His name is Luciano Lutring. I've never heard of him. Must be some special agent or other. He stole some guns and hid them in a violin case. "Sten-gun soloist," it could be a nice story, you know? What's been set up so far for the late news cover? - Not much. - Two suicides and a bag thieft. Not much has happened lately. Take this to the composing room. Have them set up five columns on the Sten-gun soloist. I'll be there right away. Hello? Will you please get me police headquarters? THE STEN-GUN SOLOIST ESCAPES POLICE Your name is in the papers. If you want to sleep here in peace, it will cost you 50,000 lire. - Tomorrow I'll pull a job and pay you. - Of course you will. You promised that once married you'd pull no more jobs. You swore it, Luciano. A bed only cost 2,000 lire back then. Now it's 50,000 and you find them only behind glass. Well, I could earn that with striptease. What's the difference between a striptease and a smash-and-grab? None. Besides, the husband should provide. But not here in Milan, it's too dangerous. They all know you here. Tomorrow I'll go to Trieste. But don't take my car, please. The instalment is due. All right, then. I'll steal a much faster one. But don't drive over 60. It's dangerous and worries me. Much better to speed than end up in jail. Let's go. SMASH-AND-GRAB IN TRIESTE MILAN STYLE Twenty million in jewellery stolen at Dorsi. The only weapon was an axe. What do you want? I'll call Luciano. You'll have to phone him, because he's in Trieste. That's not true. Who told you that? It's in the papers. They always write a bunch of lies. Get out. Leave me alone. Are you mad? - Where are they? - To the left. - Where? - Last one at the end. Look who's here. There's nothing against me this time. Not armed robbery, but attempted rape, yes. I'm filing a report. Don't let him get away. Get going. What else? Listen, Yvonne, while your husband is in hiding... - In hiding... - Meanwhile, you carry on with Franco. Are you mad? You mean you didn't see me there struggling? Just look what he's done. Go see what I've done to his face. Go on. Now, this isn't fair, it really isn't fair. Listen. I won't say anything to your husband about Franco, but where is he? I could get you a good job in a nice nightclub, shall I? Get lost. All right. How would you like to be on television? As you wish. Waiter, a Stock. Sit down. All right, let's have it. What's your plan? I want to arrange a raid in the middle of Milan, in Via Montenapoleone. It must be done at noon. Why noon? Because at that time all the women are out shopping. With all that excitement, imagine how they'll panic. It's safer this way. We'll block the streets with a couple of cars, pull the job and get away in the general confusion. In those stores, there's loot worth hundreds and hundreds of millions. - All right? - Are you talking to me? Don't you know what a handkerchief is? Use this. Keep it. Well, count me in. He's clever enough and he's very lucky. Listen, Lutring, you're young. The jewels might be worth 300 million but that's about 50 million on the market. You've got to pay lookouts, drivers, gunmen, buy equipment... The grand scale is more fun but more expensive. Maybe so. But so far, my tick has always amounted to a flat 50%. Those were small fish. In Via Montenapoleone, we're dealing with jewels that can be recognised. Are you familiar with machine guns? I had one, but I had to leave it behind for the police to help me get away. That means you're a smash-and-grabber. Let's think about it, shall we? We find gunmen, then you and I meet and talk it over. I like the idea of pulling a job in the middle of Milan at noon. The higher you set your sights today, the better your chances. You're on the ball, Lutring. When are you going to pull it? Saturday. It's Monday today. You need a month to prepare the ground. We'll meet when the practice begins. Say, Lutring. I have a little story to pass on. It was told to a friend of ours. That your wife is having an affair with Franco of Corso Novara. In fact, he said Moroni caught them in bed together at your place. Maybe it's not true. Anyway, I told you. It's a good plan. But we'll pull it ourselves. The man's too unstable with the police at his heels. But that makes it more convenient for us, he'll be the stooge. We'll let him turn up ten minutes later, and he'll be caught. Luciano. It's not true, any of it. I was never unfaithful, Luciano. It's the cops who came up with the whole story, because... Because I wouldn't tell them where you had gone. Luciano, I'm telling the truth. That snake forced his way into the house. But I did nothing, I swear it. Nothing. You should have told me. It was Franco. He did it because he was jealous. He's the one who did it all. He's the one who set the police on you. I've got a deal to offer to you. What is it? I've got some merchandise I've got to get rid of quickly. Lutring has nothing to do with this. I haven't seen him in a while. Good stuff. Contraband. I've told you, I haven't seen him in a while. - Fine. - Good. Let's go. Listen, will you let us sleep somewhere? Anywhere. We don't want your money. Only some hospitality. Let him sleep a couple of hours with me. - This is all yours. - Open it. We pay well for the hospitality. OK. I'll take you down to the storeroom. Just in case, there is a window. If the police come, I'll whistle. Make sure you do. What is it, my love? Luciano, not the liqour. Never again. Will you promise? I promise, after the hit in Via Montenapoleone, I'll stop. - Swear. - On our love. Afterwards you could turn yourself in. You go to the police with a good lawyer, and you'll be out soon. No. Never in jail. We could go to Africa, the Congo. Sorry. Then the prison of San Vittore is better. Or we could go to Venezuela, for example. In Venezuela, they have Interpol. They catch you and bring you back here. It happened with Cesaroni, the one from Via Osoppo. In the Congo, I could even become chief of police. Blast. Let's go. It's locked. This way. Let's go. Come on. - My white fur, Luciano. - Shut up. This way. Sixty seconds to go. Start off slowly and get in formation with the others when it turns green. After the job, get back in cars one and two and leave the others. Against the wall. Get out. The stockings. - Release the safety catch. - But the road is blocked. It doesn't matter. We'll go anyway. - There they are. - They fooled us. What shall we do, Luciano? Shoot? Are you mad? Just hang on, we'll lose them. Come on, get out. Hurry up. Where do I come in? You're going to stay here until you get your memory back. What are you talking about? This is not local people's work. Take it easy, I've still got open wounds. Is Lutring involved? No, Lutring's not in on it. But let's start to spread the word he is. Get after him but we can't catch him. We've got to make those who are in on it think that we're on the wrong track. I'll speak with the journalists. Later, boys, later. I said later. Take them to my office. Look, Inspector. You know I have nothing to do with it. I'm innocent. - Can I help you? - I need to talk to you. Privately. Go ahead. I'm Candida, your daughter-in-law. Luciano's wife. If you are here to hide the loot from Via Montenapoleone, -it's the wrong address. - Don't worry... - Can I have a box of... - We are closed. Why is the door open? Luciano doesn't know about this and I have no police record. Luciano doesn't allow me to get involved with his work. This time, Luciano is innocent. I'm here to talk about important matters. Will you listen to me, please? Has something happened to my boy? No, nothing has happened. But it could. This is because I want him arrested. We'll go to the police together. You've got the same temper as my Luciano. Sorry, but you have to let me explain. You're telling me? I'm his father. Please, let me explain why I want to betray him. What do you want? Be careful about what you say. Otherwise, I'll go to jail before my son does. - What lousy trick do you want me to do? - Can I sit down? Listen, if the police catch him now, it's not so bad. He only did a few things. Some stupid things, like hitting Franco. But he wouldn't be in for long. If he carries on and doesn't get out of that ring, do you know how he'll end up? They are fearful of catching him alive and they will kill him, sooner or later. I prefer a jail to a cemetery. What do you want to do? I want to take the police to his hideout. But with your consent. My consent? You should have asked my consent to marry him, not to betray him. No, you have no right to speak to me like this. - You have no right. - Listen, madam. - Call me Candida. - If they kill my boy when they come to get him, I won't even let you have the time to regret it. No, nothing will happen. Luciano will make it. Tell my boy that if he stops with this kind of life, his father has already forgiven him. - Excuse me. - What? I said excuse me. Tell me, are you a police officer? No, why? No reason. I simply thought that you could be interested in news of my husband. His name is Luciano Lutring. You've been following me for two hours. Just a second, Mrs Lutring. You want to give me some information? Go right ahead. The hospital has just discharged Franco of Corso Novara and Luciano is jealous, because before we were married Franco and I used to date. Understand? Yes, and Franco was stabbed by your husband. No. I don't believe that story. Luciano told me he didn't have anything to do with the stabbing. And he's always told me the truth. Let's forget that and come to the point. There is a point, isn't there? Well, seeing as Franco has been bothering me again since he came out and I told Luciano about this when he called... Anyway, Luciano said he wanted to get him. So I thought that, perhaps... If you follow Franco, you'll also find Luciano. So, you're co-operating with us? Co-operating... Yes, I'm co-operating, but promise that you'll take him alive, all right? Don't worry. I'll tell Moroni that's the condition, and I'm sure he'll agree. Listen. Just a second. Mrs Lutring. If you leave I'll have to follow you and how can I call the Inspector? Well, I'll tell you what. There's a bar there. Let's have a coffee. While you're making the call I'll wait for you here and you can start shadowing me. Yes. After all, a job's a job? - What would you like? - I'll have a café corretto. - And you, sir? - A café corretto and a Nescafé. - Yes, sir. -Is there a telephone here? To the right over there, sir. Would you excuse me a second? Take your time, it's quite all right with me. Can I have a light? She wouldn't give her name. She's very nervous. So it's you? Can't I be left in peace in my own home? - I'm sorry but it's urgent. - Go to the police station. No. I can't go there. Nobody must know we're in this together. If Luciano finds out he'll kill me. No. We're not in this together. In your husband's interest, you volunteered some information and we've accepted it. That's all there is to it. What is this about, anyway? Luciano should be meeting me tonight at the club where I sing. - Very well, we'll take care of it. - Wait, Inspector. I have a favour to ask. Well? What is it? Before he is arrested I want to make love to him. - After all, we are married. - I know. And he'll be in jail for so many years... - You understand, don't you? - Don't worry. Take good care of him. Thank you, Inspector. One more thing. You mustn't kill him, all right? The only reason I'm doing this is to keep him alive. - Only if he shoots first. - No, he's unarmed, I swear it. Lutring's at the Montemerlo with his wife. Should I go there with a squad of twenty? No, you two go alone. Let him get away. But take a reporter along with you. I want the news to leak out that... That he's on the run and that we're after him. I don't understand. Should we let the press make us a laughingstock? Is that what you're after? That's it. Precisely. First we've got to catch the big fish, then the small fry. Lutring's just a red herring for us. Besides, if his wife works with us, we can pick him up whenever we want. - If Lutring fires? - No, he won't shoot. Try to be there at one on the dot. At five to one I'll warn him you're coming so he'll have time to get dressed and get away. He'll be making love to his wife. Off with you now. Call me later. This is Moroni. At five to one, call that friend at Montemerlo's and tell him to warn Lutring we're coming. At five to one. LUTRING THE UNCATCHABLE THE THIEF FROM MILAN HAS ESCAPED AGAIN Hands up. On the ground. Face the wall. Hurry up. Come on, let's go. We turned up at the right moment. Excuse me... Inspector, do you have any clue, any suspicion? -It's still too early to say. - Is it the same Monday gang? Maybe, it looks like it. - Do you think Lutring is in this? - Could be... Here is one of the watches stolen by my husband at the same time the Monday gang was in action. If he smashed the window on the same day and time, he could not have been with the Monday gang, right? Obviously. - When will you see him? - I don't know. He's afraid. He doesn't suspect anything but he's frightened just the same. Let's go inside. - What's this? -50,000 lire. Because you've told us the truth, and if we haven't caught your husband yet, I have to admit, it is all our own fault. I don't want money. Thanks anyway. I'm not a paid informer for the police. You think I'm betraying him, but I'm not. It's only because I love him, because I only want him to give all this up, understand? I'll never give evidence against him, get that straight. Waiter. What will you have? Two coffees. Mrs Lutring, all information is paid for, whatever the reason for its being given. Do what you like with it, but don't ask me to take it back because the administration will get all messed up. Besides, why not take it? It's like... You offer me coffee, and yet it doesn't mean we should consider ourselves friends or accomplices. Well, when you put it that way... Listen, you must tell me all the jobs he pulls, before he does them, if possible. Otherwise the judge may think he's in with the bank robbers. Is that clear? I am afraid that's quite clear. Fine. - Won't you have your coffee? - I don't want any. If you leave town, I'll pull you in. You're the robber's wife, and I cannot say you're working with us. Is that clear? Listen... If I were arrested, would it mean jail? I'm not sure. I don't know. Well, I'm not leaving Milan. - Pardon me, but this money... - Keep the change. Four first-class return tickets to Como. - Remember your promise, Luciano. - Which one? What do you mean, "which one"? Not to pull a job here while I'm working. Why don't you take a few days off, you look tired. - Promise me. Call me. - All right. - Hands up. Stop or I'll shoot. - Luciano. Run. Leave me, coward. I've got the contract. Go to hell. I've got the contract, and I'll sing. No, you won't. Like hell you're going to sing. Leave me alone, let go of me. If I call my husband Luciano, he'll put you all in your place. Let me go. Let me go. The contract's mine. You'll pay for this. Maestro, let's start. Lutring will get you, and you'll go to hell, too. The contract is mine. I've got the contract, and I'll sing. Go sing to the police. You're the wife of a thief. You take that back and apologise, because I'm a lady. This is my establishment and I hire who I like. No. I have the contract. You'll pay dearly... Are you Candida Lutring? You must come with us to the station. No, I won't. I'm working here. I've got a contract to sing. What's the matter? Are you afraid I'm going to start robbing too? She was threatening to send for her husband. Let's go, don't make a scene. Come along. Go on. It's not fair. It's not fair. They arrested Lutring's wife in Como. Check if they'll take her to Milan and write a nice article. Don't be nervous. I'm the one who's nervous here. Easy, I won't shoot. If you don't force me to. You journalists made me do too many things. The police are chasing me because of you. And now I have to be armed. You put me in this trouble. Now you must help me. The police have the weapons. But you have your finger on the trigger. I am here to tell you that I was not involved in the robbery in Via Montenapoleone, -nor with the Monday gang. - So you all say. Give us evidence and we'll write it. I have a perfect alibi and I don't know how to shoot. So you weren't in Via Montenapoleone, you were just passing by. But you must know something about the bank robberies. I never hide my face while working. And I am with no gang. - And Versani? And Grassetti? - They are just friends. I don't do banks. The ones who did it want to let me take the fall so they're left alone. And you believed that. You are having fun blaming me for everything. To use my name in your paper every day. Do you want me to be killed? At least you know the members of the Monday gang. Tell us who they are. It will be clear you're not involved. Nobody knows them. They are new. With no police records. If I had stolen all that money, do you think I'd be here to ask for your help? I would not care about you and the rest. Why did you stab Franco from Corso Novara? He says so to take revenge because I stole his woman. - Who is this woman? - She is my wife now. They arrested her in Como today together with your two friends. Tell us the truth. Were you in Como this morning? They're going after her, too. She only wanted to work. Please, don't call the police right away. Give me time to drink something. - Do you drink a lot? - Yes, I do. - Before or after the robberies? - Before and after. Always. Don't call the police. Otherwise I'll blow up the place. We'll be at the train station at 5:00 with two cars. Then we'll go straight to Piazza Castello. Once we're outside Ridolfi the jeweller's, Testone, Virgola and me will open fire. The other two will continue firing to frighten people away and I'll grab the loot. And we'll run away. What do you think? It's a good idea, but why do you insist on using a machine gun? Because I've decided I won't work without one. Then at least you'll have to learn how to use it or else you'll kill innocent bystanders just to grab a handful of rings, people who have nothing to do with it. Here. Try this. Give me a loaded clip. Not like that. Give it to me. Set your shoulder tight against the butt and grip it hard with your hands like this. Or on your chest. Or on the belly. When you squeeze the trigger, take it easy, or else the whole clip will be used up. When this beauty is in your hands, you have to play it easy. It's just as well to always keep a few bullets in reserve, you never can tell. Here, fire at that tree trunk. Pretty good? - Give me another one. - Here. Careful, Lutring. Shooting a machine gun is just as bad as cocaine. 10 YEARS FOR LUTRING LONG CONVICTION FOR THE STEN-GUN SOLOIST HIS WIFE YVONNE SET FREE Mrs Lutring, any statement for the papers? Yes, I'm glad the judge found me innocent. But not your husband. He's a good man. Luciano's not a criminal, you know? I'm sure he's not going to go to jail for ten years just for stealing a few jewels. But they are worth millions. Ten years is still too much. Anyway, have you got any hopes of seeing your husband? Maybe, if he is in Milan. But perhaps he isn't. Where is he then? Why are you asking me that? Mind your own business. Listen, I only meant that... Who is she? An actress or what? No, she's married to a gangster. Same thing. Mrs Lutring. Mrs Lutring. Wait. Let's take another car. Let's take the other one. Come on. We won't all fit. Come on, fast. Are you coming to Viale Zara too? No, I work in television. Would you be interested in appearing tonight on television? Tonight? On television? There isn't much time now, I've got to rehearse the songs. Besides, the voice gets deeper in jail. It's damp in there. You don't understand. I don't need you to sing. At the trial, you said you hoped against hope that your husband would give himself up. Well, this evening, we would like you to invite your husband to give himself up on the television. Naturally, this will be regarded as work. Our channel is prepared to pay you for your time. Shall we say 200,000 or 300,000 lire? Very well. I'll do it. It will help your husband, you'll see. Of course. Besides, we've had so many expenses. Will you pay in advance? As you wish, of course. Very well. I'll come. It's a name that causes a shudder whenever you hear it, whenever it's mentioned. At the same time, there's someone who has other feelings whenever she hears it. Apprehension, anxiety, nostalgia. Yvonne Lutring, his wife. You seem a little nervous. Don't worry. We are here to help. Tell me, what sort of a feeling do you get from being called Mrs Lutring, a name that's... well, become notorious? Well, I'm not afraid because I know him. If you could turn the clock back would you marry the same man again? I don't know. I had quite different plans. You know, I'm a singer. And when I met Luciano I sang for a living, but seeing he's mine, I'll keep him. Why? What has he done? I know he's done things. But not everything they say. Sometimes the police are worse than him, they're such liars. Still, it was precisely the statements made by the police at the trial that led to the case against you and your husband in Parma being withdrawn. Yes, that's true. But they gave my husband 10 years. Ten years. That's too much. Do you think your husband will have heard about the sentence? Maybe... I don't know. And do you think your husband is in front of a TV set at this moment listening to you? Who knows? He could be. Speak to him, talk to him. Say something to him. - What shall I say? - Whatever you want. - Shall I say what you told me to say? - Say whatever you wish to. Luciano... Listen, Luciano. If you love me, really love me, go to the police and give yourself up. Why don't you stop this terrible life you're leading? Why don't you rest a bit? Pretend you're a prisoner of war. Ten years will pass by soon, you'll see. And I'll wait for you, so when you get out, I'll be there waiting for you, Luciano. I love you. I'll wait for you. Go to the police, Luciano. I'll be waiting for you. Enough. Luciano. The conviction is true. It's in the paper. - They gave you ten years. - I can't stand it any more. Come on, don't be stupid. You know what you should do now? Go abroad. You're right. I'll go to France. I was there when I was a child running from home. So, it's all easy. It's not good for me to work with someone like you. Chased by everyone. Listen, do a raid in the centre of Milan. So the police will believe that I am in Italy and I'll have the time to cross the border. I can do it for a friend but let's split right away. This is our new Italian client. His name is Luciano Lutring. Part of a new wave of criminals now making their way here. Especially robbers. At last we have the criminal common market. Until now the Italians had been out of it. But Mr Lutring is outside the criminal common market. He's a loner, a man with not much courage and rather nervous. Precisely for this reason he's all the more dangerous. As we know, those who are afraid shoot more readily. This is his lovely wife, an ex-singer in nightclubs. And Lutring, in his primitive psychology, steals jewels in order to keep on a par with his wife's good looks, to boost his ego. He's a handsome man. Seems impossible for such a head to have such a twisted brain. That's what I think, too, when I see a face like his. But there's always a reason. Hereditary diseases, alcoholism... Alcoholism is an essential factor here. He's been drinking heavily, In my opinion he'll become a killer, sooner or later. That's why we are taking an interest in him. Besides, the criminals here will make him work under special conditions. That way, he could easily become a killer. We have to increase the filming in our streets, then, hoping to catch him with other bandits. - He's trying to sell some jewels. - No one wants to buy them. He's asking a high price, and nobody here trusts him yet. It seems he's been going round in a white Alfa Romeo. It will be easier to spot him. You're not Parisian, are you? No, I just work here. What kind of job makes you run from the cops when they film? Our kind of work. I don't have a work permit. I'm Italian and unemployed. If it happens again, don't panic. They're just trying to get profiles. Things have been getting hot here lately. Leave me alone to play in peace. - Don't you care for Paris? - Not much. It's rainy and cold. Have you any murders on your record? We can get along then. I'm thinking of a trip to the Céte d'Azur, interested? Why not? - We're on, then. - You want to play now? Say, young man. You want to be arrested for begging? Clean the sidewalk up and beat it. Quickly. Keep moving. Keep moving. Nobody move. LUTRING, THE THIEF FROM MILAN HITS IN FRANCE LUTRING THE THUNDER THIEF YESTERDAY IN PARIS TODAY IN A SHOOTING IN NICE Come back tomorrow. I'll make you an offer then. No. Leave the jewels with me. - What for? - I'll explain. We've been sectioning Paris into areas. You're not authorised to work here, so these jewels must go to the area agent. What do you mean, area agent? I was the one who took the risks. - I stole them and they're mine. - So they're yours. If they aren't, then they're nobody's, not even the jeweller's. Lutring, take my advice and get out of Paris. You're nothing. Just because the big newspapers are writing you up, don't let your head get big. Bobinò, these pockets are full of jewels, but I'm hungry. For three days, I've been trying to sell them. You'll starve to death, Lutring. You'll hand yourself over to the cops and then you'll eat. Nobody will buy your goods. You can try at the banks, but you're alone. The Algerian and Corso aren't worth a franc. If you want to try the banks alone, you can do so. But jewels in your hands are just nothing, mere stones. You can throw them away if you want to. I'll give you some friendly advice. Give them to me, I'll give you 500 new francs. You'll be able to eat, to sleep, to buy a one-way ticket to Amsterdam. I can find you a nice, quiet job in Amsterdam and you'll be money-ahead. Come on, give them to me, Lutring. Here they are. Take your stones. Hello, Amsterdam? Inspector Olsen? This is Inspector Julien. We are sending you photos of Mr Lutring. Yes, the Italian. We know he'll be working in Amsterdam. We'll send all the details we have. With an axe? It's him. He's already there. Unbelievable, he works in the same way. - Hello, here I am. I'm coming. - Hold on. Anything to declare? - No, nothing. - Wait. Will you please open your bag? Give it to me. I'm sorry, but your name is not on the passenger list. Forgive me. Here, it's this one. Gate number seven. - Come on. Move. It's late. - Sorry I'm late. I've decided you'll go to Paris. Actually, we'll go together. You should convince him to go to Nice. - Now it's too late. Don't you think? - No, we can still try. It looks like you want him dead. - No, it's not true. - Think about yourself. If you bring him to jail there will be a reward for you. You could buy yourself a bar, a restaurant, and help him while he is in jail. If you leave him in Paris, they'll kill him. I swear on my children, if you give him to me, I won't touch him. I'll get you a passport. It's easy. - What is it? - I can't stand it any more. I'm afraid of everything. I'm even frightened to go to Paris. - Why don't you leave me alone? - No, you can't. You are involved in this story as much as I am. Believe me, Yvonne, it's the only reasonable thing. Eat it. It's fresh. I'll wait for you in Paris then. A friend will bring you a passport. It's forged, of course, but perfect like mine. Try some. Once you arrive in Paris, hop in a taxi, go to Place Pigalle. You'll see your picture outside the Mayfair. - On the picture, write your address. - Why? Why? But why don't you tell me right now where you're going so I can come, too? I can't trust anyone. It's not just a question of trust. You know I change beds every night. At least now I have the cash. - No. Luciano. Not with the gun. - What? I'm afraid. You know I get nervous without a gun. Please, Luciano. You promised. - Give me the gun. - No, you promised. Hello? Inspector Moroni? It's urgent... - Who are you calling? - Hello, Inspector? Stop. Inspector Moroni, please. Where have I seen that face? I've seen it some place. She's certainly a beautiful young lady. But, no, I don't mean her, who's he? He's someone I know, but where have I seen him? At any rate, we'll follow him night and day. He's moved in with an Italian, a bank clerk, no record. You know who that funny face with Mrs Lutring is? That's Moroni, Chief Inspector in Milan. I'll bet anything he's here to try to get Lutring back to Italy with her assistance. This way, please. The show's just beginning. Inspector, it's a little early for that, isn't it? - Good evening, Julien. We meet at last. - What are you doing in Paris? Well, I've heard so much about Pigalle. You won't believe it but I have never been here. - May I offer you an Italian coffee? - All right. There is a bistro nearby where they make real espresso. We can also take the opportunity to talk shop a while. Not here, Luciano. Let's go. I've been waiting for ten days, every evening. I know, darling. But let's go. I'm afraid. As you wish. - Any news of Mrs Lutring? - Yes. She's in Paris. I heard she was. One of our men has been following her. There's someone trying very hard to make us lose sight of her. Listen, Julien. We are old hands at the game. It's in our interest to catch him. Let's speak openly. Come sit down. You're right. I agree. - Let's talk. - Let's sit in that corner and talk about it. We are both interested in Lutring. - Each in a different way. - We both want to catch him, right? Yes, but each of us would like to be the first to catch him. What's the difference who catches him? The important thing is to eliminate a dangerous criminal. Yes, but there is a difference. What is it? - We need to catch him alive. - So do we. Lutring learned to shoot. If you find him, you'll have to shoot too. So how do you plan to catch him? His wife. She is working with us. Congratulations. But there is a condition, he must live. And the wife gets the reward. As soon as his wife meets him and finds out where he is, she'll try to convince him to turn himself in, otherwise she'll call me to tell me where he is hiding. It takes patience. And we'll wait. If you get the phone call, what will you do? What should I do? I'd call my friend Julien and we'll make a decision together. All right, under these conditions, we can make a deal. Very well. - Do you have an appointment? - Yes, with Mrs Lutring, but now it's late. You are pulling my leg. Next time, if you need me, come to my office. Your Lutring is waiting for you at Cartier, in Rue de la Paix. He'll come soon. This is hard. Please don't drink any more. I beg you, put it down. If I don't drink I'll be afraid. Come on, it's just tea. Do you remember that tea? Back then I was a good boy. Wake up. Do you have a double room for tonight? Of course, but not for you. If your name is Luciano Lutring you can't expect a bed. You'll have to pay. How much? 3,000 francs and you must leave early in the morning. Luciano, what is it in Italian lire? Over 300,000 lire. We work for them, I guess. If people like you don't sleep, they come to a bad end. I'm sorry. We're 500 francs short. It's all I've got. Got a car outside? Throw it away. All right. I'll take that. We're even. You've earned millions of lire... and this is what we've come to. Tomorrow we'll go away. Don't be sad. Where can we go? We'll rent a house of our own, outside Paris. I had hoped we would return to Milan. Can you imagine the price of a safe trip to Milan? One and a half million lire. We need the money first. There's only one way I can get it. Bedin, do me a favour. Get a photo printed of Mrs Lutring's arrival at the Gare de Lyon. - Do you recall it? - Yes. Then call your friend, the reporter at France Soir... Jacques Loret? That's the one. See that he prints it on the front page. But Inspector Moroni will be in the same photograph. Of course, that's the idea. You must not tell Loret who that is with Mrs Lutring. Lutring should just find out they arrived together. He'll know who he is. But be careful, no scandal of any sort, understand? Those jewels make your mouth water. - How much are they worth? - Two billion in old francs. I have one more very important favour to ask of you. Lutring's young friend Corso, have him set free and ask him on my behalf and in his own interest to go to Lutring and convince him to try a raid at Cartier. - All right. But you see, Inspector... - What's the matter? Well, the problem is that Corso would have to present Lutring with a genuine idea that's foolproof for a raid at Cartier. - Plan this foolproof raid with him, then. - With who? With Corso, of course. You ought to know the right way to plan a raid, having worked among jailbirds for ten years. What is it? Something wrong? I was just wondering, whether we are preparing a trap or a grave, for him to fall into, or for us? A trap, I'd say. I thought I'd drive. No, I'm driving the car. Someone has to help smash Cartier's windows. I can't do it by myself. You wanted me to get a buyer and bring him to Rue de Rivoli. I did it. You do the smashing and then you get in the car. I drive, you hand the jewels over and he'll pay. Can't we just get the cash off the chap without smashing Cartier's windows? No. He's a hard man. Besides, he trusts me. It's me who brought him into this, and I guaranteed a good deal. Do you think we can break Cartier's windows with just a little lead ball? Just the first ones. Next, we use machine guns. And if they don't break, we run. - No. We've got to go through with it. - You can do it, all right. You'll be driving. We'll be exposing ourselves to the public with machine guns. I want to do the job tonight. Not tomorrow. Tomorrow is too late, I've got to be in Milan. YVONNE LUTRING IN PARIS But this is you. And Moroni's with you. They're on to us. We've got to get out of here. They followed you and you didn't even notice it. Fool. If they surround the house, we'll be killed. Well, don't be afraid. He brought me to Paris. What? That's right. Your father knew about it, Luciano. You bitch. You coward. Get up. Please let me speak, Luciano... Face me. I should smash you the way I smash a window. But I can only kill when I'm afraid. I can't do it, I'm only sick of you. I'm not capable of breaking you to bits. When are they coming to get me? How much did you sell me for, Candida? Candida, when your mother gave you that name, she had no idea of how you'd turn out. Luciano, they're not coming to get you, don't worry. Nobody knows we're here. Not even Moroni. Calm down now. I love you, Luciano. You know I do. If I've done anything, it was only to save your life. But you'll never believe that, I know. If you would just come back to Milan with me... With Moroni on our tail? Yes, because it's the only way. This way, with Moroni behind us, you'll be able to return to Milan. You'll have a chance to live there with me. But if you stay here in Paris, the French police will get you, sooner or later. And they wouldn't hand you over to the Italians, either. You see, here in Paris there are two police forces... Each one trying to make an arrest. Each one has its own interests. We must take advantage of this situation. Do you understand, Luciano? How much are they giving you to hand me over to the Italian police? All right, Luciano, it's not in my interest for you to come to Milan. No, I want you to stay here in Paris and get yourself killed for just a few pieces of filthy jewellery. That way I'll be rid of being a gangster's wife. I swear... I swear it, Candida. I'll come with you tomorrow to Milan. Yes, my love, to Milan. Get ready. I'll come get you tonight. - He's lost his mind. - Come on. It's a miracle I'm here. But I finally managed to convince him. He's leaving with me for Milan tomorrow. - I'm not sure that... - What's he doing today? - Another job... - Out with it, where's he going? Cartier. Well... Listen, I tried to persuade him. I did everything in my power. - Yes... - He promised me, since we were married. His promises aren't worth anything, can't you see that? Then you won't do anything more for him? I can only tell you to return to Italy with your passport. Get your stuff out quickly. Save yourself, at least. You know it's my duty to warn the French police. - But I couldn't... - You see... If a criminal's going to commit a crime, I cannot protect him. - No, wait. - Wait for what? For him to kill someone? Must I become his accomplice, too? Are you mad? Where are you going? You're leaving me here alone? What else can I do? It's the only way you can start a new life. Listen, I've got to go and telephone Inspector Julien, unless you want to do it and collect the reward? You scoundrel. You are a dirty policeman. You're all the same. You haven't understood me at all, not at all. Now, you listen. I'm telling you, I'm only doing my job. And what's yours? First a tramp and next a spy. I've done too much. Now it's over. Yes, Inspector Julien's car. I'll put him on. It's Inspector Moroni of the Italian police. Yes. Hello. This is Inspector Julien, give me Inspector Moroni. Hello, is that you, Julien? Yes, it is. Good morning. What is it? Lutring has left his hideout and is making for Cartier. Thank you for the information. I'll be taking all necessary measures to capture Lutring. Pardon my curiosity but where is Lutring's hideout? In Sarcelles, but exactly where, I don't know myself. Thank you for your loyalty and co-operation, Inspector Moroni. Now I'll give you some confidential information in exchange. It was our idea to entice him to Cartier, because we're interested in apprehending Lutring but you can have Mrs Lutring. Don't shoot him because he knows a lot about Milan and Paris. My men have set a trap and it's up to him not to make it into the grave. Have a safe journey. Thank you, and make a good job of it. Fill it up. Stop. Your papers. Is this your car? That's Lutring. Lutring, driving a car belonging to the police, is making his way up the Champs Elysées. All cars making for the Champs-Elysées area are warned, Lutring is making for the Etoile. This is car number seven, from Place de l'Alma -up Avenue Marceau to the Etoile. - This is car 21. We are proceeding from Porte Dauphine up Avenue Foch to the Etoile. This is car 18 heading up Avenue Kléber from the Trocadéro. This is car number 12. Lutring is proceeding from the Etoile towards Place des Ternes, Boulevard de Courcelles. This is car 27 taking Avenue Malesherbes from Place de Wagram. Lutring is proceeding towards Boulevard de Courcelles. All cars make for the area... Surrender, Lutring. All roads are blocked. LUCIANO LUTRING IS IN THE INFIRMARY OF PARIS PRISON AWAITING TRIAL.
