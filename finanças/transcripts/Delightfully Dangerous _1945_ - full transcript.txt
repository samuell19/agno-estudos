[MUSIC PLAYING] I wish... I wish I were there. [ORCHESTRA PLAYING] (SINGING) In a shower of stars, underneath an umbrella of moonbeams with you, I'm caught in a dream. In a shower of stars, 'neath a bower where sunflowers dance for a windswept beam. A lover's melody, with little wings for me. And I can hear it say, we will love tomorrow for this yesterday. On a billowy cloud, 'neath the twinkle of summer rainfalls with you, in a shower of stars. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE TURNS TO SCORNFUL LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] Come on, unconscious. Come on. You'll sleep better horizontal. [PLAYS SHRILLY] I can't stand it either. Wake up, genius. The big day has dawned. What time is it? 8 o'clock. How come it's so dark? You've got your eyes closed, silly. Oh, gee. I only dreamed it. Dreamed what? I was with Morton Gould last night, in New York! Yeah, I met you walking home. Hey, has my telegram come yet? What telegram? From Jo! She promised she'd let me know if she could come today! [KNOCK AT DOOR] Come in. Oh, it's you. Well who did you expect, Frank Sinatra? Bring it in, Susie. Thank you for the loan of your recording machine, Molly. Put it over there. The things I do for $0.50 a week. I recorded my graduation speech last night. Would you like to hear it? Do we have a choice? [KNOCK AT DOOR] Come in. Have you kids seen the programs for the show? They just came! Oh, I hope my name's in it this year. I'm want to start a scrapbook. What's the idea? The show doesn't go on for hours. Listen, if I ever get down off these toes, I'll never get back up again. [GIGGLING] Quiet, girls. Listen! (RECORDING) Ladies and gentleman, parents, (HEAVILY ROLLING THE "R"S) friends... What friends? (RECORDING) Music is the language of the spheres. Good music never become extinct. [ECHO AND RECORDING MALFUNCTION] [GIGGLING] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Yes? Good morning, young ladies. Rehearsing so early? Sherry, were you expecting a telegram? Yes, from my sister. [BELL RINGS] - There it is. - Oh, thank you. There's the first bell. You'd better hurry if you want breakfast. You two will never be ready. All right, girls, there's the first bell. Come on, Nadine. Come on, Jen. Well, what are you waiting for? But maybe she can't come. Well, you'll never know if you don't open it. Come on. Well? Molly, she's coming! She's coming! "Have arranged for understudy to take my place today. Will arrive 1 o'clock train. Forever love, Jo." Oh, Molly! [BELL RINGS] [SQUEALS HAPPILY] There's the bell. Come on! Oh, golly. I bet nobody ever had a sister like mine. I wonder if she'll recognize me? Her own sister? How long since she saw you? Last summer. But I was only 14, then. Just a kid! Oh. You mean way back in BG. You know, before girdles. Oh, Molly. You should've made me put up my hair last night. Jo's so fussy about that. Look at her. Just look, not a hair out of place. I wonder how she does it. She squirts stick'm on it! The last time I tried that, I couldn't get my hat off. Honest! This must be a very exciting day for you, Sherry. Oh, you can say that ag... I mean, yes, Professor Bremond. I'm looking forward to seeing your sister. Of all my pupils, you're the only one whose family I have never met. Oh, well Jo's so busy all the time. No sooner does she close in one show than she opens in another! Oh, I see. What about you, my dear? Will your charming mother be here today? No sir, she's in Niagara Falls... on her honeymoon. Honeymoon? Again? Yes, sir. It gets kind of discouraging. Just about the time I get one stepfather broken in, I get a new one. WOMAN AT STATION: Here it comes! [TRAIN BELL RINGS] Well, Mr. Hale, Mr. Arthur Hale. Now don't tell me I'm mistaken. We sat next to each other last year at the school play. I had my little Pekingese with me. My daughter Nadine was the leading lady. Oh yes, yes of course. She bit you, remember? Your daughter bit me? Oh no, my Peke. My daughter was so embarrassed. Well, it was really all my fault. I was scratching her leg. [LAUGHS] My daughter's? No, no, no. The peke's. Oh, Mr. Hale. You're so funny. You say the most amusing things. [CHATTER AT STATION] Excuse me. Sorry. CONDUCTOR: Board! Board! Board! She didn't come. And she promised. This is the first promise she's ever broken. There's probably a very good reason, dear. Now, you mustn't let yourself be so disappointed. Remember, we're all depending on you for the show this afternoon. You're the star, you know. I know. And that's why... [BEGINNING TO CRY] That's why I wanted Jo to be here. Come on, Molly. Excuse me. Where could I find a cab to take me to Fernridge School? Well, I'm afraid you can't, Miss. You see, every cab in town's on the way over there now, full of visitors. Well, how soon will they be back? Well, I expect they'll stay until after the show. Oh dear. Don't tell me I have to walk. How far is it? Straight down that road there, it's about 20 miles, roughly. Afraid that's a little too rough for these heels. I don't suppose you could take me, could you, Mr, uh... Perkins. Peter Perkins. Listen, Pete. Would $10 put you in a higher income bracket? Well, I could always list it as a gift. The things you men think of. Yeah. You know, Arthur, I deeply appreciate your interest in the school. I always enjoy coming up here, Professor. You never let the kids look like amateurs in your performances. How do they feel about doing a Morton Gould operetta? The whole school's very exciting. I think you'll enjoy it. And you'll hear a real voice, a girl named Sheryl Williams. Good. I'm reviving a Strauss musical. So far, I haven't been able to find a leading lady who can sing those romantic old waltzes. Can I meet Miss Williams? Yes, but... What's the catch? Sherry is just 15. 15? Well, she'll get older. But I have to have someone this year. I can't wait for my star to age. Well, I understand she's got an older sister who's quite a musical comedy favorite. Oh, what's her name? Uh, Josephine, I think? Josephine Williams. Never heard of her. Let's go backstage. I'll introduce you to Sherry. What's the use? I'm not interested in infants. Well, you might learn more about her sister. What'd you say her name is? Josephine Williams. All right, so your sister's a star. Yes. All I want to know is what she's starred in. Well, she's playing in New York now. What's the name of the play? Well, it's... oh, I don't know. She doesn't know. What's the name of anything she's ever been in? Well, there was... oh, you've got me so mad, I can't think! Did you ever see her in a play? Well, how could I? In winter, I'm in school, and in summer, well... well, she never works in summer. You know what I think, don't you? Who cares what you think? Lay off, will ya? What's the idea of getting her all stirred up just before the show. Because I'm sick and tired of hearing about her mythical sister! You mean, you think I'm lying? Why don't you grow up? Personally, I think your sister's been giving you a song and dance, and I don't mean on any stage. Here. Nadine, look out! Why, Mr. Hale. Oh, I met you last year when you came for the show. My mother's peke bit you, remember? Yes, I was scratching her leg... the peke's. Well, it's awfully nice to see you. Won't you come in? Well, thanks very much. Professor Bremond was going to introduce me to Ms. Williams, but he seems to be lost in the shuffle somewhere. Oh, I'll be glad to introduce you. Girls, this is Mr. Arthur Hale, the famous Broadway producer. How do you do, ladies? (TOGETHER) How do you do? And this is our little Sherry Williams. (TEARFULLY) How do you do? What's this, the star of the show in tears, and just before the curtain's going up? Well, we'll have to fix that. It's all her fault. That's not so. It is so, so! Just a minute, ladies, please. I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hale. You know everybody on Broadway... all the stars. Well, I know a great many of them. Have you ever heard of Sherry's sister, Josephine Williams? She is a star, isn't she? Yes. I was talking about her just a few minutes ago. Mr. Hale, tell her the names of some of the shows that Jo's been in. Well, let me think. There were so many of them. Did any of you girls see a play called "Dancing Shoes?" (TOGETHER) No. I didn't. Well, she was in that. A terrific hit. Oh, yes, indeed. It ran several seasons. And your sister, a really great performance. I'll never forget her in that first act. She was so beautiful with that gorgeous black hair... You mean blonde hair. Uh, yes, of course. Blonde hair. But in the first act, she wore a black wig. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Overture, overture. Overture. [GIRLS BEGIN CHATTERING] All ready, girls. Everybod... Sherry, aren't you dressed yet? No, ma'am, I... You're late, I'll help you. Mr. Hale, if you please? Certainly, I'm sorry. Sherry... Thank you. Well, lots of luck, Sherry. I'll see you later. Oh, they've all gone. [OVERTURE BEGINS] Can't you go any faster? I can, but the horse can't. [LAUGHS RAUCOUSLY] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING BEAUTIFULLY) Once upon a song, diamonds grew on trees, and the moon was made of cottage cheese. Once upon a song, Christmas came in June. Every day was Sunday afternoon. For the doubters, I can show that... that it could happen once upon a song. Once upon a song, butterflies wore clothes. And it rained the petals of a rose. Once upon a song, cows played clarinets. And the jitterbugs hummed minuets. For the doubters, I can show that all you need is faith to know that it could happen once upon a song. [ORCHESTRA PLAYS] [APPLAUSE] Oh, chicken, you were wonderful. I've never been so thrilled in all my life! You've no idea how much you've improved. Do you really think so? Ah, sweetie. Oh, anyway, I was kind of giving my all with you and him both out there. Him? A boyfriend? Oh, no. Someone much more important. Mr. Arthur Hale, the big producer. We had quite a long talk just before the show. What did you talk about? About you. He thinks you're wonderful. He does? He raved! He said he never would forget you in the first act of "Dancing Shoes" with that black wig. -What else did Mr. Hale tell you about me? Oh, let me think. [KNOCK AT DOOR] May I come in? Mr. Hale! Why, certainly. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Here she is! How are you, Miss Williams? Mr. Hale. You did like the show? Very much, especially you. Honest? Cross my heart. You must be very proud of her. I am. Girls, where are you? They're waiting to take (HALTINGLY) pictures of the whole cast. Excuse me. I'll be back in just a minute. My sister. Oh. Hello. If you'll pardon my curiosity, Miss Williams... Now that we're alone, you can drop the Miss Williams. You know who I am. I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about. You mean you really don't know me? I'm not sure. I'm supposed to know every musical comedy star in New York, but you still have me confused. Oh, well, you're a very busy man, Mr. Hale. You couldn't possibly remember everyone. Still, I'm certain I've seen you somewhere. Perhaps... Could it have been in a performance of "Dancing Shoes?" If we keep that up much longer, you'll have me believing it. Oh, don't tell me you lied to Sherry, Mr. Hale? I'm one of those weak characters who can't stand a weeping woman. Sherry wanted everyone to hear that you were a star, so I lied for her. Right away, everyone felt better. Especially me. Well, I'm sorry if Sherry's vivid imagination caused you any discomfort. But I appreciate your gesture. Just a minute, please. But you are obviously of the theater. Perhaps. Then perhaps I could interest you in my show. Would you consider coming to my office tomorrow? It happens that I'm desperately in need of a leading lady. If your voice is anything like Sherry's... Well, have you forgotten, Mr. Hale? I have a long-term contract with "Dancing Shoes." If you'll excuse me, I'll look for Sherry. Oh, gosh. Now, chicken, you're not going to be silly about this, are you? I don't like working all summer anymore than you do. Then why are you doing it? Well, you don't think I'd cancel our vacation unless I had to, do you? Why can't I go with you? Because you wouldn't enjoy it. Hot theaters, uncomfortable hotels, and stuffy old trains. Believe me, dear. You're much better off right here in school. If I could only see you in one show. Summer school doesn't start for two weeks. Can't I visit with you until then? Honey, I told you. The show closes in New York tomorrow night. And then we go directly on the road. Now be a good little trouper, will you? Life is so difficult at times. Yes, I know. Now please write, and don't run out of money. All right, Jo. But I feel like I'm wasting the best years of my life! Oh, darling. Be a good baby. Bye-bye. Come on, darling. Wow, what a day. It's me for bed. If I'm gonna catch that early train to New York tomorrow, I'm gonna have to do some fast sleeping. How's about you, Dreamboat? I've got it! Oh, Molly, I've got it! Here we go again. No, this is a super duper idea. It came to me just like... [SNAPS] that! Well, forget it just like... [SNAPS] that. Every time you get one of those super dupers, somebody winds up in the soup. Not this time. Listen. Pardon me. Are you Miss Molly Bradley? Yes, sir. Your mother asked me to meet you. Are you my new father? No, Miss. I'm the new butler, Robert. Oh. This is my roommate, Sherry Williams. She's here to meet her sister. But she doesn't know it. I'm going to surprise her. She's never seen her sister. No? On the stage. I see. Where is she playing? Well, it may sound silly, but I don't know. Um, how could I find out? Might I suggest that you phone her place of residence? There's a phone right over there. Well, why didn't I think of that? I'll be right back. Gee, are you intelligent. It runs in the family, Miss. Hello? Bradford apartments? I'd like to talk with the clerk, please. The clerk? Well, he just stepped out for a cup of coffee. I've been delegated to take over temporary. Mhm. Miss Josephine Williams? I don't know exactly where she's playing. But I know it's one of them theaters on 42nd Street. You're welcome. You mean you never go to the theater? No, Miss. I spent all my spare evenings at home, practicing on the piccolo. You too? Say, we must have a jam session sometime! Jam session? If I may... Jo's playing at one of the theaters on 42nd Street. Would you mind dropping me off there? Very good, Miss. Right this way. PROMOTER: Yes, sir! And starring none other, folks than that hypnotizing that tantalizing, scandalizing, red-headed bombshell. None other than that famous Bubbles Barton. Whoa, just a minute, sister. You're in the big city, now. Yeah, the next time you come to a full stop, you want to hold your hand out. Just till the [INAUDIBLE] passes. Get your tickets now, folks! The show closes tonight. Your last chance to see the little lady before she packs up her bubbles and goes on tour. Yes, my friend. She packs up her bubbles in her old kick back and takes her smiles on to someplace else. Brother, would you not throw that gum on the sidewalk? I have to walk up and down here, if you don't mind. Folks, you've never seen anything like this Bubbles Barton. Oh, maybe in a dream, perhaps. Yes, sir. That chick's your dream girl come to life! Ask your folks... girls, girls, and more girls. Two hours of fun and folly. Feast for the eyes and ears, just exactly the way you folks like it. And starring none other than that tantalizing, hypnotizing, scandalizing, red-headed bombshell. The one and only Bubbles Barton. Hey now, listen, that's getting to be a habit with you, sister. You'd better quit it. Ticket, please. Sorry. No minors allowed. But I have to find out something! Why don't you wait until you grow up, kid? No, you don't understand. I have to see... Miss Bubbles Barton. I think she's my sister. You think. Don't you know? Oh, please. It's so important. OK, kid. Show closes tonight. I'll be out of a job tomorrow, anyway. Hey, Steve! Pass the kid in. Oh, thanks. [BAND PLAYING AND WOMEN SINGING] [APPLAUSE] [SULTRY MUSIC BEGINS] (SINGING) When you come around, [APPLAUSE AND WHISTLES] (SINGING) Or I'd rather spend the evening with mother. You bore me, you kill me. But baby, you thrill me. Don't you know I'm only teasin'. So give me a break, and spare me the flowers. For when I'm with you, the minutes seem hours. Your kisses offend me, but baby, you send me. Don't you know I'm only teasin'. You're mighty slow. You're not so smart. When I said no, [ROWDY LAUGHTER] (SINGING) I surely thought that you had caught the wink in my heart. On Saturday night, if we'd go out dancing, when you take me home, there'll be no romancing. I'll freeze like December, but baby, remember. I'm T-E-A-S-I-N you. [CHEERING AND WHISTLING] You look at my legs as something to smile on. But is it my legs, or is it the nylon? Don't you know I'm only teasin'. If you should like, a perfume rare, [MEN YELLING AND URGING] (SINGING) It's something new they call Cologne du Camembert. If I were a queen, I'd say as a starter that all of you should be knights of the garter. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] Hey Donny, that's what I want for Christmas. [MEN'S LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] PROMOTER: Ask your folks. Girls, girls, and more girls. Two hours of fun and folly. Feast to the eyes and ears, just exactly the way you folks like it. And starring none other than that tantalizing, hypnotizing, scandalizing, red-headed bombshell... [BEGINS WEEPING] Bubbles Barton. Well, look, sister. The show can't be that bad. Oh, well, I'm sorry, but you have to move on and take your tears with you. You know, you ain't doing the box office any good. [SNIFFLES] PROMOTER: Get your tickets now, folks, because the show closes tonight. Yes, so this is the last chance to see the lady before... I'd like a ticket for Fernridge, please. I'm sorry, there's no space left. No space? Well, when's the next train? 5:30 tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning? That's right. I beg your pardon, sir. There's a... a young lady to see you. Jeff, I thought I told you I didn't want to see anyone tonight. I'm... I'm... Sherry, what are you doing in New York? What's the trouble, dear? (TEARFULLY) "If I can ever help you, please let me know." Oh, Mr. Hale! Will that be all, sir? Jeff, would you stay right here? (UNENTHUSIASTICALLY) Yes, sir. [WEEPING CONTINUES] Shall I change the record, sir? It seems a trifle gay. Come no, Sherry. Take it easy. It can't be as bad as all that. Oh, it's worse. It's just about the end of the world for me! [BREAKS INTO FRESH TEARS] Would it make you feel better to tell me what happened? Oh, I couldn't. I'm too ashamed. Ashamed? About what? My sister. I learned the truth about her. I saw her. Hardly any clothes on. All those men! [CONTINUES CRYING] Well, how did it happen you saw what you did? I saw her show! Why didn't you tell me she was in burlesque? Oh. Burlesque. You knew all the time she was Bubbles Barton. Your sister, Bubbles Barton? Not really. You've seen her? Oh, yes, Miss. You know, sir, she has the most beautiful pair of... eyes you've ever seen. Bubbles Barton. Certainly. I thought she looked familiar. You mean, you go to burlesque? Well, yes. On and off. Not that... I mean, sometimes. Well. Tell me, Sherry. Did you sister see you at the theater tonight? No. Splendid. We'll get this all ironed out before you talk to her. Now, the first thing to do is to get comfortable. Oh, look at me. A mess. Excuse me. Have you had dinner? No, sir. Well, how about a sandwich? Or better yet, a salad and a lamb chop. It would only stick in my throat. A spot of tea, Miss, or a glass of milk? Milk? No, thanks. Well, there must be something. What do you do at school when the bottom drops out of everything? Well, at school, when Molly and I are face-to-face with a crisis, we usually have a hot six special. Jeffers, a hot six special, please. A what, sir? Can you imagine that? Jeffers doesn't know what a hot six special is. You don't? I'm mortified to say, Miss, I don't. Well, there's really nothing to it. It's simple enough. You take two scoops of ice cream, chocolate and vanilla. Put the chocolate on the bottom. Chocolate on the bottom. (DRYLY) Yes. Then you add a slice of pineapple, some grated coconut, a few raisins, and some marshmallow sauce. And then you fill up the glass with some hot caramel, fudge, and sprinkles and whipped cream and nuts. Nuts? Jeffers, a hot b... a hot six special, please. Sounds terrific. Yes, sir. "Terrific" is the word, sir. Miss Jo, how come we've got to work this summer? We usually relax during the heat season. I know it, Hannah. But they've never closed down all the burlesque houses in New York before. What if the rest of the country followed suit and started clamping down. Then where would we be? You're worrying about something that ain't gonna be. As long as men like to look at women, there's gonna be burlesque. I hope you're right. We're going to make all the hay we can while the sun still shines. [PHONE RINGS] It's gonna be a long, cold, winter. [PHONE CONTINUES RINGING] Hello? May I speak to Miss Barton, please? This is urgent. Name urgent. Find out what he wants. She's busy right now. Any message? Who? What? Where? Says which? Watch your blood pressure, Hannah. What'd you say that man's name is, again? Mr. Arthur Hale? Is he on the phone? Uh-uh. Yes, sir. What about Mr. Hale? Yes sir, I got the address. Hannah, for heaven's sake. Miss Jo, hold on to something. Miss Sherry's in town. Sherry? She's with Mr. Arthur Hale right now. Well, what in the world is she doing with him? Well, it can't be good, because he wants to know if you'll come and get her. Will I! Hannah, get your coat. You're going with me. Yes. Arthur Hale. Miss Jo, ain't that the producer? I don't care who he is. I wish he'd stop messing around in my affairs. [BUZZER] Where is she? Shh, please. What's the matter? Will you please stop yelling? Is she all right? Yes, she's just sound asleep. Don't wake her. Why not? There are a couple of things you should know first. Such as? She went to the theater tonight. She saw your performance. Shhh. Who are you? -I'm Jeffers, Mr. Hale's gentleman. Well, I'm Hannah, Miss Williams' lady. How do you do? How do you do? What do you got there? A terrific concoction, aptly called a hot six special. I thought Miss Sherry might like another one, if she survives the first two. She done eat two of them already? Yes. Well, what's in them? Two scoops of ice cream, one of vanilla, one of chocolate. You put chocolate at the bottom, and then you... Why? Why? Oh. That's a very disturbing question. It's too bad she had to learn the truth the hard way. Still, it's a great relief. No more ducking and diving people who might tell her. I was frightened to death at Fernridge you might recognize me and embarrass her. I dreaded the day when she'd learn her mistake. Her mistake? Yes, you see, I never told her I was a star in musical comedy. That was her idea. I only told her I was working in a show, and she went on from there. You don't know her imagination. And you didn't have the heart to disillusion her. You can't explain burlesque to anyone who's not actually in it. It's everything people say it is. Noisy, obvious, down to earth. But so are a lot of people. And they come to our shows to be entertained. Wait a minute. You know, a lot of people find my show slightly diverting, too. Of course. But your shows are very smart and artistic. Bubbles Barton might be an awful flop in a Hale production. And that's a chance I couldn't take. That's what I couldn't tell you yesterday. You see, in burlesque, I'm a star, making a lot of money. As long as that money can go on giving Sherry the advantages of good schools and fine teachers to train her voice, then I'm staying in burlesque. You don't have to explain that to Sherry. That's just about what I told her. You did? Yes. But how did you know? I didn't. I guess I just wished it. You've been very kind and most understanding. I'm sorry the Williams family has caused you such disturbance. I promise it won't happen again. You know, I once produced a play something like this. At the end of the first act, the misunderstanding between the boy and the girl was all straightened out. The boy suggested they celebrate with a little drink. I'll take bourbon, what about you? I'll take Sherry. Home. Eh, do you mind if I call you in the morning? Why? I'd like to find out how Sherry took my explanation. I don't understand. What did she say when you told her? Nothing. Nothing? When I finished arguing your case, I found the judge was sound asleep. Hello, chicken. 18, 19, 20. [PHONE RINGS] Sherry, is that you? This is me. Yeah. Oh, I'm eating a gooey chewy. Have one. Boy, am I silly. Well, listen, tell me all about your sister. How was the show? What did she wear? Oh, oh, I can't tell you. Not over the phone. But it's changed my entire life! I've always heard that suffering mettles the character, and now I know it's true. Molly, I'm facing the most critical crisis. Sherry, for gosh sakes. You're not sick, are you? Oh, you don't understand. This is a mental upheaval. I've got to rescue my sister! Yes, Jo. I've only got one sister, and she needs a lot of rescuing. What? I said, I'll be right over. Don't do anything desperate until I get there. Bye! Good morning, darling. Hello, Jo. Sleep well? Yes, thank you. Wait'll you see the cute things I have for you. A little play suite and the trickiest little sweater. Really? Something the matter? Of course not. Come on, Sherry. Any time you're not interested in new clothes... [PHONE RINGS] Yes? Here? Oh, yes. All right. Why must I go back to Fernridge? Can't I stay here a few more days? I'm sorry, darling. It's out of the question. But I can't leave now. I mean, I can't leave today. Why not? Well, I... [INAUDIBLE] [BUZZER] Good morning, Mr. Hale. Good morning. I just dropped by to return your umbrella. Oh, thank you. Won't you come in? Thank you. You're looking very well this morning. Well, I'm feeling very underprivileged. Will you sit down? Thank you. Jo insists that I go back to school on the 5 o'clock train. Well, that's a very nice train. The dining car service is excellent. Well, it's not the train that's worrying me. You see, I have to leave for Jersey City in a few minutes. We open there today with a matinee. And Hannah's already left for the theater to take care of my baggage. Well, what's her problem? The problem is I can't miss that matinee and Sherry must be put on the train. Am I a child that has to be led around by the hand? Definitely not. Uh, suppose we fix it this way. I'll call for you here at 3 o'clock this afternoon. And after a drive through the park, we'll have some tea and things at the nicest place you can think of. And I'll introduce you to the conductor of that nice 5 o'clock train. Did you two cook this up while I was asleep? Oh, Sherry. All right. I accept your invitation. And I'll be ready at 3 o'clock. And now I'm going to have my breakfast. That was very sweet of you, Mr. Hale. But please forgive my asking if your interest in Sherry has anything to do with your new show. She's really too young for a career, you know. Of course she is. It never entered my mind. It'll be fun to spend the afternoon with her, and it might help me forget my own problems for a couple of hours. Now don't you worry. I'll have Sherry on that train at 5 o'clock this afternoon. Thank you. Now, you're in a hurry. Oh. Your umbrella. Ah. I'll be back at 3 o'clock. Goodbye. Goodbye. Any ideas? No. But I can't go back to school and face everybody, as long as Jo's in Burlesque. Gee, wouldn't it be wonderful if Arthur Hale fell in love with Jo and put her in his new show? Wait, I've got it! Well, what is it? I can sing that music! I'll get Mr. Hale to put me in his show! You? Sure! Then Jo can quit burlesque, and I can support the family until everybody forgets there ever was a Bubbles Barton. Gosh, what a heroic thought. Yes, (SLOWLY) isn't it. Oh, but there's only one thing wrong. Mr. Hale might think I'm too young. Well all you got to do then is make him think you're older. Well how can I do that? Well, my mother always says... and she's proved it... that no man can ever guess a woman's age if she knows what to do with her hair, her clothes, and her figure. Well, there isn't much I can do to my figure before 3 o'clock today. Don't be silly. You know what I've seen my mother do? Arthur Hale calling for Miss Sherry Williams. Oh, I have a message for you, Mr. Hale. Miss Williams went out and said she might be an little late. And would you mind waiting? [BELL CHIMES] May I have a sheet of paper? I'd like to write a nasty note. Yes, sir. I understand. [WOMAN CLEARING THROAT] Hello. How do you do? Sherry! Am I late? What have you done to yourself? Don't you like it? It's supposed to be very chi-chic. You have no idea how long it took me to get all glamored up for our tea party. Tea party? Do you know what time it is? Tea time's gone, the train's gone. Everything's gone but you. Well, I don't think you're being very nice. I'm not trying to be nice. Do you remember I promised your sister to put you on that 5 o'clock train? Well, you can put me on the next train. What time's it leave? Oh, about midnight. Midnight! Well, you don't have to bark at me! Please. I'm a wreck as it is, after sitting here for hours picturing you being kidnapped or run over by a truck. You did, really? Certainly. Well, I'm terribly sorry. I had no idea you felt that way. What am I going to do with you until midnight? You mean, because you're going to be busy all evening? Yes, I'm helping to sponsor a big benefit tonight. I know. I read it in the papers. Well? Well, I don't want to seem pushy, but I am all dressed up with no place to go. You wouldn't mind spending the evening with me. I'd love to. Come on. Jeffers'll fix you some tea while I change. Where are we going? To my apartment. Woo-woo! Please, Miss Williams. [BAND PLAYING] You see, the only way I can get Jo out of burlesque is to get a job myself. You mean, by singing. Yes. Maybe I'm not good enough for a Broadway show. The point is you're not old enough. Why? There's plenty of girls on Broadway that are only 18. Yes, but you're only 15. Oh, no. Yes. Well, what's the difference, as long as I look 18? But you don't. That's only because you know. Why, I bet any stranger... especially a man... would think I was at least 18. What'll you bet? Make it easy on yourself. Hello, Mr. Hale. Jimmy, your dad told me you were in the Pacific. I was, but they gave me some shore leave. Aw, that's fine. I happened to see you from across the garden, and I thought I'd come over. [CLEARS THROAT] Sherry, this is Jimmy Burns. Miss Williams. Hiya, Sherry. Hey there, sailor. How's about dropping anchor for a minute? What do you mean, a minute? I've got thirty days to do nothing but talk to beautiful women. Hello, Mr. Hale. Hello, there. Hello, hello. Need any help, sailor? Always glad to help the Navy. Listen, leather necks. This beach head's taken. Go jingle your medal somewhere else. Medals? You mean you're a real hero? I hate to talk about it. You tell her about it, Sam. Well, it was like this, beautiful. There I was, alone in the jungle. Surrounded by the enemy. All my ammunition gone. Nothing to fight with but my bare hands. Hey, it's me she's interested in. That's only your opinion, Sergeant. Hello, Corporal, remember me? Guadalcanal? Which war? Oh, my mistake. Pardon me, lady. Haven't I seen you in pictures? No. I only sing on the stage. Oh, yeah. I could tell from way over there you were an actress. My name's Gallegher, and meet three guys named Joe. (TOGETHER) Hi. Hello, Joes. Uh, won't you sit down? Uh, say, chum. How about some chairs? No, I'm sorry. Mr. Hale isn't at home. Oh, is that you, Miss Barton? I mean, Miss Williams? Yes, it is. I just called to thank Mr. Hale again and make sure that Sherry got away all right. She didn't leave! Went out dancing, Miss. She and Mr. Hale did what? Well, at least Miss Sherry was dressed for dining and dancing, a little beyond her years, perhaps. But to my mind, she looked delicious... if you'll pardon my saying so. And just where did that Prince Charming take her? Oh, I see. Thank you. That dirty double crosser. I even asked him this morning cold turkey if he wanted Sherry for his new show. Well, what'd he say? He said she was too young. But he doesn't think she's too young to take out dancing. Miss Jo, Miss Jo. I hope she dressed up. I wonder what she wore. Oh, Hannah. That's beside the point. Don't you see? He wants her for his new show, so he's dressed her up to look older to prove to her she can get away with it. Go tell Sam to put Francine on for the rest of the show. Yes. Well, that's how it was told to me. [LAUGHTER] Boys, a toast to Miss Sherry Williams. ALL: Sherry Williams! Thank you, boys. Sherry, did I ever tell you about... [CHATTER] Shove over, pal. Excuse me, Mr. Hale. [LAUGHTER] [ENTHUSIASTIC CHATTER] I beg your pardon. Could you do without me for a minute? [APPLAUSE] Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you my very dear friend, Morton Gould, who will play for you one of his own compositions... "Through Your Eyes to Your Heart." [APPLAUSE] [ORCHESTRA PLAYS] [SHERRY HUMS] Let's hear it. Come on, sing it again. [HUMMING TURNS INTO SINGING] Shhhh! (TOGETHER) Go away. Don't stop, let's hear it. Come on, baby, jam. [SINGS] [STOPS SINGING] That's for you, honey. [MUSIC PLAYS AT FASTER TEMPO] [APPLAUSE] (SINGING) You seem to see woman, just meaning me. You saw the meaning of moon flooded skies above. My way and your way lead straight to the doorway of love! Nothing old, nothing rests. We just knew the meaning of two happy nests. Now, you're mine, always mine, if we part. Oh, my one happy spot is when I saw through your eyes to your heart. [ENTHUSIASTIC APPLAUSE] Mr. Gould... Yes? I hope it wasn't too rude of me. Oh, not at all. Oh, it's nice of you to say that. And I want to know I enjoyed singing with you again. Again? When did you ever sing with me before? At Carnegie Hall. Carnegie Hall? Oh, but you wouldn't remember it. It was only a dream. Oh. Come along. Where are we going? To meet Mr. Hopkins, my radio sponsor. Really? I think he might be interested in putting you on my program. Honest? And you mean he'd pay me? Certainly! Now, don't be too anxious. And remember, don't accept his first offer. Don't accept his first offer. Let's go. Mr. Hopkins, Mrs. Hopkins, Mr. and Mrs. Kellog. Miss Sherry Williams. How do you do? Thank you. I suppose Morton has told you I'd like you on my radio show. Yes, sir. Now, we can agree on a suitable salary. What would you suggest? What's the matter? Well, that's not the way it's supposed to be. You're supposed to make me an offer so I can say no. [LAUGHTER] Oh, I see Morton's been talking to you. Well, I... will you excuse me, please? [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER IN DISTANCE] There's a silly trick. Give it to Red. Here, try it. [CLICKS] [LAUGHTER] Hello. Jo. This looks like a lovely party. A little short of women. Gentlemen, this is Miss Williams, Sherry's sister. How are you? Hello. At ease. Miss Williams, you should've heard her sister sing tonight. She was terrific. Wasn't she, fellas? She was. Wonderful! How nice. Just where is my little sister? Your little sister is somewhere around here receiving the personal applause of Morton Gould. Shall I get her for you? No, thank you. I'm sure she's perfectly safe with him. - Won't you sit down? - (TOGETHER) Here. Take mine. No, thank you. I have to talk with Mr. Hale. Will you dance with me? Well, thanks. But, uh, I warn you, I'm not as fresh as I was earlier in the evening. You still look very fresh to me. Would you hold this? Surely. Has that dame got a figure, or does every woman look that good to me since I got back? Sure, that's who she is. Bubbles Barton. Is that something? Bubbles Barton? The hottest thing in burlesque, that's all. (SIGHING TOGETHER) No. Yes. Well, let's have it. Have what? The questions you want to ask. No questions. I know all the answers. All but one. If you're referring to Sherry... No. No, not Sherry. It's you. I'm afraid I had you filed under the wrong letter. Of course, you know I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about. Maybe I can explain. Look. See that man down there? That's you. Tall, attractive, pleasant, prosperous. All that's right there on the surface. But that's all. A girl meeting you for the first few times couldn't possibly tell what's underneath. So? So she has to guess. Usually, it isn't very difficult for anyone who meets as many men as I do. Almost automatically, you classify them. They're either A-man, ah-men, or L-men. What's an A-man? An angler. You know the type. Oh. And the ah- and L-men? Did you lose something? Well, whatever it was, it's gone now. Oh, that's too bad. I'm cutting in, Mr. Hale. OK? Yep. Thanks! Mr. Hale, I just lost my girl, too. What do you do in a case like that? Well, Jimmy, if you're interested enough, go after her. If you're not, do what I'm doing. Forget it, go home, and go to bed. Night. Night. I'm so excited, I can hardly talk! You're old enough to sign a contract, aren't you, my dear? Well, not quite. Oh, well in that case, you better bring someone along to sign for you. An older member of your family. Well, there's only one in my family. Hello, chicken. Jo! Oh, my goodness. Wait till you hear the most wonderful thing. Mr. Hopkins is going to put me on his radio program! Mr. Hopkins? Why, he's Lady Edith Cleansing Cream! Mr. Hopkins, my sister, Jo. How do you do? How do you do? Oh, the one you said was on the stage. You can say that again, Mister. This is Bubbles Barton, queen of burlesque. Is this true? Yes. You mean you've never heard of her? On the contrary, you have quite a colorful reputation. Mr. Hopkins says you'll have to sign the contracts. That won't be necessary now. You mean I don't get the job? I'm sorry, dear. May I ask what changed your mind? The obvious reason. I've spent 20 years building up a dignified reputation for Lady Edith products. I can't have that name turned into a joke. A joke? Just because your new star has a sister in burlesque? Miss Barton, perhaps you don't know the slogan for Lady Edith cleansing cream. Removes everything in 30 seconds. I can't afford a tie-up like that between my product and burlesque. But you can't do this! It isn't fair! She'll quit burlesque. Well, that was the whole idea... my getting a job so she can quit! Now, chicken, it's no use. I can support us both... the money you promised. Remember? I'm sorry. Please, baby. He promised! You promised! Everybody heard him promise! [SOBS] Come on, baby. Jeffers, I'm scared. [PHONE RINGS] Why, sir? We've been rehearsing a week, and the show's no good. Well, the first week of rehearsal's always depressing, sir. Hello? Yes. Miss Williams, sir. I'm not in. Miss Sherry Williams, sir. Oh. Little poison ivy. Hello? Hello, Mr. Hale. I called to thank you for your roses. They're beautiful. Yes, I'm practically well now, thanks. The spots are fading out. Oh, didn't you know? I had a case of delayed measles. No, Jo didn't catch them. What a pity. What's that? We're going away today, Jo and I. Mhm. On a long vacation. You know, of course, Jo quit burlesque. Oh, yes, she's had a couple of offers for musical shows. Broadway productions, but... oh, by the way, how's your new show coming along with that wonderful music? I'm afraid the music sounds very tired. For a week, I've been living on a hot six specials. That's too bad. Well, anyway I just had to call and thank you for the flowers before we leave town today, and to wish you good luck with your show. Goodbye. Oh, that was Mr. Hale. Oh, what did he want? Oh, nothing... in particular. Oh. Uh... but he asked about you. About me? He wondered if you'd caught the measles from me. [LAUGHS] Probably very disappointed when you told him I hadn't. -It's too bad you and Mr. Hale don't like each other. Oh, it isn't that I don't like him. I just can't forgive myself for saying those terrible things to him. And I haven't been able to think of a way to make it right. He's awfully worried about his new show. He's afraid the music's too old-fashioned. Well, he's right about that. I don't believe that audiences today want that old-fashioned tempo of 1894, with their (POMPOUSLY) pompous prima donnas with their high, trilling voices. Start at the beginning. I'll show you what I mean. [PIANO PLAYS] [SINGS OPERATICALLY] (SINGING DRAMATICALLY) And the high E! [BOTH GIGGLE] Can you imagine paying $5.50 for three hours of that? It's awfully funny. Well, that's exactly what I mean. Of course, it's only my personal opinion. But if I were producing a show, I think it would go more like this. Move over. [PLAYS UPBEAT MELODY AND SCATS] Well, Hannah! Thanks for the boogie ride. Uh, Miss Joe, you'd better tell me what all you want packed so you can catch that train. All right, I'll come show you. Now you see, that's what I think they want. But of course, I'm not the producer. What is it you want? My home recording machine? And a blank record? Well, when do you want them? Right away? Okey doke, I'll be over in ten minutes! A wonderful idea, Joe and Mr. Hale's show. But why didn't you just call him up and explain it to him? It's something you can't explain. He's actually got to hear how Joe does it. I'm dumb, I guess. But why do we have to trick Jo into recording it? Because Jo would starve to death before she'd let Mr. Hale think she was asking a favor. JO: Sherry? Oh. Oh, Sherry? Yes? Well, hello, Molly. Hello, Jo. What are you two up to? I just came over to say goodbye. I hope you have a wonderful vacation and everything turns out just super. Thanks, dear. Sherry, the men will be here in a few minutes with the truck. Is yours ready? Mhm. Uh, I was just telling Molly how you swung Mr. Strauss around a little while ago. It sounds sharp. Just imagine, taking Strauss out of the grave and putting him in the groove. I'd love to hear you do it. Oh, I was just noodling around. Oh, come on, Jo. Do it for Molly. She's never heard you sing! Oh, but there isn't time. Oh, please, Jo. I've never seen you on the stage, and it would give me something to tell my children. Well, all right. But just once over lightly. What did I do? Oh, you remember. [BEGINS PLAYING] [SCATTING AND PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] JO: Oh, that's enough. A couple of trunks for Grand Central Station? - Yes, sir, right in the bedroom. - SHERRY: Mr. Hale's show. Come in. JO: Oh, forget it, chicken. I haven't been invited, and I won't be. Excuse me, Miss Jo. The man's here for the trunks. Oh, I'd better go see him. Everything all packed, Hannah? HANNAH: Yes'm, I packed everything but that print dress, and I didn't know whether you wanted it or not. JO: Do you think I need it? HANNAH: Well, maybe you'd better take it along. Are you sure you got it all? Oh, sure. What do we [INAUDIBLE] girls do next? I'm gonna take this to Mr. Hale's apartment, and I won't leave until he listens to it. HANNAH: Sherry! Yes, Hannah? Sherry. Where are you all going? The cab will be here right soon. Oh, I'm going to do something for Jo. For Jo? I've got to get some toothpaste. Oh, yes. Toothpaste. Goodbye, Hannah. Wish me luck! You need luck to get toothpaste? I'll be right back! Goodbye, Hannah. Thanks a million, Molly, and I'll let you know how it comes out. Here's hoping. Here's hoping. [GIRLS SHRIEK] Excuse me. [SIGHS] [PLODDING PIANO PLAYING] Did you enjoy your lunch, sir? Terrible, simply awful. Well, I am sorry, sir. I'm afraid I'm not much of a cook. Oh, it's not the food, Jeffers. It's just that I'm not getting anywhere. For two cents, I'd take the whole miserable show... [BUZZER] I don't want to see anyone, Jeffers. I understand, sir. You, again? Yes, I must see Mr. Hale! It's a matter of life and death! Now, you come back here! You can't go in there! Mr. Hale... - [GROANS] - Yes, I tried to stop her, sir. But she's rather elusive. Mr. Hale, I've just got to talk to you. Will you go away? I'm a very tired man. I've been up all night with a sick player. -That's just it! Your troubles are over! Will you hear? My troubles have just begun. Show her out. Yes, sir. Did you say show or throw? I'm going to stay right here and save your show in spite of you. And if you try to throw me out, I'll scream. Nice and loud, too! Telephone Miss Williams and tell her to come over here and take this little genius away immediately. Mr. Hale, you can't do that! It would spoil everything! Will you stop waving that thing in my face? Oh, I'm sorry. But don't you understand? This is our only chance. Jo and I are supposed to leave in a few minutes on our vacation. Good. Any vacation for you is a vacation for me. Jeffers, hurry! JEFFERS: Yes. Well, didn't she say where she was going? Yes'm, she said she was going to the drugstore. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Yes. What? Again! Yes, certainly. I'll be right over. She's in Mr. Hale's apartment. This is getting monotonous! Yes, Especially for Mr. Hale. Hannah, take the bags to the station. We'll meet you there. Yes'm. If you men would only listen to us women, you'd get ahead a lot faster! Where is that sister of yours? (FRUSTRATED) Oh! I mean you too! Mr. Hale, why won't you listen to me? Be reasonable! It's for your own good! Why are you so stubborn? All right, I give up. What am I supposed to do? Nothing. Just listen to this rec... it's gone! Jeffers! [CRASH] Unbreakable. Our unlucky day. [RECORD PLAYS JO'S MUSIC] JO (ON RECORDING): Oh, that's enough. SHERRY (ON RECORDING): See what I mean? You'd be perfect for Mr. Hale's show. JO (ON RECORDING): Oh, forget it, chicken. I haven't been invited, and I won't be. SHERRY (ON RECORDING): Well, how do you know? JO (ON RECORDING): Well, even if he liked me, Mr. Hale would swoon at the thought of putting a girl from burlesque into one of his ultra refined shows. Oh, no. He hasn't got that kind of nerve. [RECORDING ENDS ON ECHO] How do you like that? Miss Bubbles Barton in our production, sir? Absolutely unthinkable. Why don't you like her, Mr. Hale? Because she's smarter than I am. I don't like women who are smarter than I am. What's keeping Miss Williams? I have no idea, sir. I got here as quickly as I could. The door was open. Hello. Please forgive us, but we're in an awful hurry. We have a train to catch. Come on, chicken. You're not catching any train. Good ideas don't come often, but little poison ivy here just forced me to listen to one. You might be the answer to my dilemma. I want to talk to you about my ultra-refined show. Jo! Yes? Don't accept his first offer. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) A game of love, a game of cards. Your luck is good on Friday, and on Monday, it retards. It's all so true. It's all the same. This finale's as good as the rest of the show, we have a hit. We? Oh, yes, of course. Thank you, Jeffers. I think we have. If I may say so, sir. You know, that Miss Josephine is simply dynamite. I think you're right, Jeffers. [SINGING CONTINUES] [ORCHESTRA PLAYS] (SINGING) A game of cards is like a twist. You wonder what the deuces wild, and hearts are lie... (SINGING) This is my first ball. This is my debut. Oh, what a setting, oh what a debut. It's so nice to dance, such delight to dance to your lovely waltz. [CONTINUES SINGING] [HOLDS HIGH NOTE] (SINGING) Oh, some deep way makes me long to sway. And my heart takes wing as I start to sing. My eyes will shine [SINGING CONTINUES] [MUSIC BECOMES MORE UPBEAT] (SINGING) That solid tune sends me to the moon, and my heart goes bump when the drummers thump I can't keep still, and I never will. For it's such a thrill when I swing! [MUSIC SLOWS] (SINGING) Melodies out of the past. Songs, these yearnings, always will last. [CONTINUES SINGING] [MUSIC ACCELERATES] (SINGING) Boogie rhythm, that's what I need. Boogie rhythm, oh, yes, indeed. I'll stay with 'em while I'm alive. I'm at my best when I one, two, three, four, jive. [ORCHESTRA PLAYS] Arthur wants me to marry him. Are you going to? I think so. (SINGING TOGETHER) We won't forget that life's a duet that ought to be sung from start to the end. [SHERRY SINGS DIFFICULT SOPRANO MELODY] [APPLAUSE] ["IN A SHOWER OF STARS" REPRISE]
