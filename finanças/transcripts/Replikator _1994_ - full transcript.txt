Captioning made possible by lions gate entertainment [Indecipherable radio transmission] [Helicopter sound and radio transmission] Announcer: Sunrise at 6:45 eastern standard time. Radiation hazard, avoid sunlight. Have you seen ludo? Try the night scene. Jim! Hey, John. Ludo still in there? Uh-huh. Computer: Score: 31,000. Good game, player man. Yes. Select another game to continue. Hey, thanks be to cyberspace, a worthy opponent at last. Ha ha ha. Whee-ha! Come on, blue. Ha ha ha ha. Hoo-ha! Yee-ha! Ha ha. What's the matter, blue? You're making it too easy for me. [Gunfire] Ha ha, ha, whoo! Whoo! Come on, blue. Come on, blue! Heh heh heh, yeah! Game over, blue, whoever you are. [Machine-gun fire] Ah, yes! Yee-ha! [Dance music plays] Thank you. Hey, good game, blue. Sure wasn't expecting ludovic to show up tonight. He's been out for 6 months, Kat. Don't you think you guys should talk? Why? It's over. Well, at least your little encounter was restricted to cyberspace. If I'd known it was him, I would have tried harder to win. [Laughs] Can we go, please? Sure. Hi, Kat. You still mad at me? Keep it movin'. Sorry. Ludo! Wasn't that... Uh-huh. Hey, you should talk with her. I do ok on my own. Well, it doesn't matter, because I found a-- hey, wait! Ludo! Ludo, listen to me. What? You know how when we try to replicate anything complex it just falls apart? Man, don't you ever relax? Have a drink or something. It's the peripheral software. That's where the replicated sample amplifies imperfections in the original. Well, if that's right, then we, uh... Route the signal through a super-cooled path. Ludo, that's it. John, tomorrow we go online. Laptop computer voice: Cheever, John... On parole for cyberspace appropriation. Granby, is anybody working till close tonight? I doubt it. Thanks--easy! Ok, I'll--I'll see you tomorrow. Tomorrow. John cheever? You're too soft, Valiant. Police loudspeaker: Curfew time, parolee ludovic. Kathy: We agreed this isn't what the replikator was for. Judge: Mr. Ludovic, your forging days are over. Kathy: They're confiscating the lab. Ludovic: Sorry, Kat. Kathy: Everything, my life. Ludovic: Sorry, Kat. First name? Ludovic: Ludovic. Last name? Ludovic: Ludovic. What's your name?! Ludovic ludovic. What idiot would name a kid ludovic ludovic? A forger? Think it's funny? We'll see if you're still laughing in a few years. [Electric razor] What are you talking about? Shut up! You don't know nothing! I've already told you. Will you shut up! Narrator: Salvador wishbang, another young follower of the new destiny underground was arrested today for pushing virtualitol. The virtual reality drug was hidden in copies of new destiny's manifesto, which advocates the creation of a superior race. The gullible wishbang's mentor is lord falcon, whose real identity is a secret. One wonders if the falcon is a drug dealer, too. Vote on the guilt or innocence of Salvador wishbang. Remember, when you vote, you're eligible to participate in lotto-justice and win great prizes. Shut up! I'm not takin' this crap anymore! Hey, John. Ludo. Computer: Good morning, ludovic. All files clear for access, excluding replikator interface program. Thank you. Announcer: The high tower proudly presents the one, the only, miss Tina show! [Jazz music plays] Computer: Heads up! Heads up! Coffee's up! It's hot. It's good. It's ready. It's ready. It's hot. Morning, everybody. Do we have a replikator online? No? A progress report, perhaps. A breakthrough, Mr. Scott. Yes. What was the problem? The problem was how to sustain quantum flux in the replication field while conforming the signal from the sample that we're replicating. Fine. Fine. When can we expect the test? Tomorrow, maybe. Good work. I'm sure you're right. Candor. [Jazz music plays] Ludo. [Music stops] Good morning, Cecilia. When are you guys gonna trust me with this thing? I do. The parole board doesn't. [Sighs] I heard something. Yeah? Zyklor's about to test the replikator. If they succeed first, we're history. Zyklor is bureaucracy. Everything takes forever. Oh, really? That's not what I heard. They are ready, online. Oh, they are? So are we. We're ready. Are you certain? Good. Then we test it tonight, before we tell the world. This system works, I'll buy you a private party at the high towers. [Jazz music plays] Scott, what a surprise. Chief, how goes the law-and-order business? Oh, it has its days... And...how may I assist in the good works of zyklor, Mr. Scott? We're ready. I can't wait any longer. You sure you're ready? You sure you're ready? If we're ready, the competition can't be far behind. If we're ready, the competition can't be far behind. All right, Scott. All right, Scott. Once I commit... There's no turning back. Once I commit... There's no turning back. Good. What the hell were you thinking, promising him we'd be ready tomorrow? Ready to test. That's what it is, a test. Why do you set yourself up like this? To please him? Because he will eat you alive if we screw up. It's research, honey. He understands. I don't trust him to understand, ok? Not at all. I really don't get your problem. It's just a test. This is the atomic bomb, little girl, the door that can't be closed. This is not just a test. Kathy, I can't explain this. I just think it's too dangerous to trust him the way you do. Scott is the one who believed in me, all right? He invested in my ideas. Yeah, well, intersec was tearing your lab down. Yeah, well, at least he had vision. I don't mind answering to that kind of support. Woman over P.A.: Kathy, it's the investors from Seoul. Secure video, line 2. I'll be in my workstation if you need me. Fine. So, Kathy, would you say that our investors cannot be assured that replicated tissue capacity will be marketable this quarter? That's correct. We might be able to pull it off that fast, but I can't guarantee it. We're counting on you, miss moskow. You'll keep US advised of any developments, won't you? Of course. [Sighs] [Telephone rings] Good morning. John speaking. Uh...uh... You know where to find me. No, no, I, uh... I'll be right there. I want to speak to Valiant. The parole board has the right to reassign your work term if you don't keep up your obligations. There's no reason to reassign me. I've done nothing wrong. In my opinion, you have. So i'm reassigning you, John. Hey, John, you're on the winning side now. I'm already on the winning side. Ludo's replikator goes online tonight. [Dialing] Yeah, it's me. Either, you know, I'm in another dimension, or I don't want to answer this call, so... [Sighs] Leave a message. Maybe I'll get back to you. Heh heh. Hello, Victor. Just thought you might like to know we've reassigned that street trash of yours, John cheever, to zyklor, and there's nothing you can do about it. Hey, moskow. Hey, moskow. Say hello to John cheever. Say hello to John cheever. You know, that other child genius of biodesign. Why? Work program reassignment. I don't need him. Well, when you've finished your cause in science, perhaps you can set about to reform the justice system. So do it and die, you jerk. Ohh. So, John... How's ludovic making out? Ok, I guess. Mm-hmm. Well, he usually does. Would you, uh, help him, John? [Beeping] Forever optimistic. I like that. Tokyo. I've got to take it. Uh, the disk? See you in 15. Announcer: 10 years ago today, the United Nations bans virtualitol. The drug became popular as a virtual reality enhancer. Its side effects, however... Hey, watch where you're going! Kathy. Hello. Hop in. [Dialing] You have reached zyklab, the zyklor tissue regeneration laboratory. If you wish to reach Dr. Lena turnbull, dial extension 47. For Kathy moskow, dial extension 43. For Dr. Hart-- this is Kathy moskow. Please leave your message after the tone. Hey, Kat, don't erase this yet. You want to hear it. Yes? You called in an alarm. Impossible. Well, we just had one. Biodesign? We'll take a quick look-see and be on our way. No way we had an alarm. A visionary scientist needs to commit... Sometimes needs to commit in the absence of certainty. You have that quality, Kathy. That Mark of genius. The lab is a team. Never mind them. Let's stay on genius... And Genesis... On the essence of creation. [Door slams] Cecilia? You... The replikator. No one else thought of it. That's the point. I didn't think of it. It was an accident. Tell me about it. Destroy the disk. What? Run... [Distant door slams] Well, I was, um... My ex-partner and i-- yes, ludovic, the, uh, young forger. Back then, we were a couple of cyberspace cowboys working on virtual reality software problems, you know, resolution, that kind of thing. [Gunshots] I'm very impressed. So that's when ludo asked, if we can recreate an image in 4-dimensional density, then what's the difference between that image... And the real thing? This is it? Yeah, mm-hmm. It's the first thing ever replicated? Ha. Backtrack. I'll take the level down. Can you see him? Computer: Illegal command. Enter personal security code. Incorrect code entry. Please try again. Listen, ludo... Pull the disk. I'll take that, Mr. Ludovic. Computer: Enter code 5 to terminate test sequence. Now, Mr. Ludovic. Test sequence engaged. Enter code 5 to terminate test sequence. Heads up! Heads up! Coffee's up! It's hot. It's good. It's ready. It's ready. It's hot. It's good. It's ready. It's ready. Test sequence engaged. Enter code 5 to terminate test sequence. Test sequence engaged. Enter code 5 to terminate test sequence. Replication test sequence engaged. Engaged. Enter code 5 to terminate test sequence. I've been, uh, thinking about that test tomorrow. I've been, uh, thinking about that test tomorrow. And I was thinking that maybe we could, uh... And I was thinking that maybe we could, uh... We could take it one small visionary step further... Some... Rudimentary life form, something simple. What do you say? Well, we're not ready to do a life form, even a simple one. And even if we were, I mean, should we try? Kathy... It's going to happen. [Sloshing in puddles of coffee] What's the matter, ludo? Aren't you happy to see US? Repeat after me... Man has become immortal. Come on. Snap out of it. You knew in the back of your mind everything would come down to this moment. This is the ground floor, brother. Can't you see what we can accomplish? We go back, secure the disk... And wait. [Laughs] We deserve this. We earned it. We own it. No. [Groans] What is it? What's happening? Ohh! I don't know. We can't do this alone, ludo. We must stick together. [Footsteps] [Woman screams on TV] Hi. Hi. Sorry I jumped the gun today. That's ok. Relax. Right. If you're hungry, there's something on the stove. Great. Thank you. Dance for me! Slowly... Ooh, that's nice. Oh, let me touch you... Let me touch you... Yeah... Yeah... Kathy's voice: If we can recreate an image Kathy's voice: If we can recreate an image a 4-dimensional density, then what's the difference between that image and the real thing? And you through me we will make... A secret race of superior men and women. I should have visited. What? Ludovic. What about him? In jail. I should have visited. Tsk tsk tsk. Get him out of here. Ludo: I want to talk to Valiant. You talk to me, ludo. What happened to the two cops? Only two dead people, ludo. A security guard and Cecilia masters. No cops. You liar. What in god's name is she doing? Your favorite street kid just murdered two coworkers. Attila the hun answered the call. Murder? No. Not ludovic. Yes. Ludovic. Ludo, you were found at the scene of the crime, with the murder weapon, with her blood all over you! Victor, I didn't do it. Yeah, if you didn't do it, you know what? Somebody went to a lot-- I mean a whole lot-- of trouble to make it look like you did do it. Yeah. Two intersec cops. Ok, ludo, ok. Let's take it once more. From the top. [Rock music blares] Uhh-- [crack] Computer: Biodesign replication file. Computer: Biodesign replication file. Defendant ludovic alleges defendant ludovic alleges one intersec officer impaled on the east wall. [Sighs] Nothing. Nothing. Bang. Defendant ludovic alleges at least 4 gunshots fired in chase would have hit north boiler. Analysis: Recent paint... So, ludo... You're not as crazy as we thought. Spectrographic analysis reveals traces... Oh, boy. ...consistent with fractural ammunition. Somebody's been messing with the evidence. Is there a possibility that we had other officers-- you know, maybe from, you know, another jurisdiction, whatever-- who were investigating biodesign? The answer is no. Victor, I would hate to think that you were attempting to place responsibility with me. Disabuse you of this... Speculation. Uh, may I make the assumption, uh, that you are declining this opportunity that I am giving you to tell me what the hell is going on, sir? The death of Cecilia masters has left the community crying for justice. We have a suspect in custody. He will have his day in court. Yeah, but--ok, no, what about this-- the administration, in fact, the very future of this program... Is no longer your responsibility. Good night, Victor. Ludovic. Guard: Cell 16. Hello, ludo. [Door opens] How long has it been, almost 2 years? Maybe. Over 2 years. The warden told me you've been a model inmate. In a real facility with, uh... Computers. The parole board is recommending you for a new work program. The rehabilitation committee is serious this time. Interested? Get disk. You're not gonna let me down, are you, ludo? I'm a new man, inspector. Destroy disk... [Electronic beeping] All parolees are required to wear this homing device. Does this mean we're married? You eat and sleep with it. Run... Run. Guard! Man: Quiet! I want to talk to Valiant! Quiet! Quiet! Announcer: A bludgeoning in biodesign. Lawmen lock up ludovic for the murder of masters. Ludovic, the street-kid forger, now computer whiz, claims innocence. What do you think? Hear the facts on the justice channel, your interactive pulse on public security, and vote on ludovic's innocence or guilt. Remember, when you vote, you're automatically included in the lotto-justice draw. You could win a neuro-cap vacation for 2, a dream date with Tina show, or your choice of high-fashion persona brand easy-breathing face pieces. No. No way. People change, Kat. You don't know him anymore. It doesn't make sense. That's not ludovic. He's not a killer. [Beep beep] Computer, show me a plasma field diagnostic. Computer: Plasma field diagnostic on screen. Thank you. [Keystroking] Would you like your phone messages from last night, Kathy? Yes. Go ahead, please. Hey, Kat, uh, don't erase this yet. You want to hear it. I'm testing a matter replication system tonight, and, uh... Well... I just thought you might want to be here when it happens. So come on over. Ciao. Lena? What? Have a seat. Ok. [Typing] Hey, Kat, uh, don't erase this yet. You want to hear it. I'm testing a matter replication system tonight, and, uh...Well... Weirder and weirder. Yeah. Look at the time. 7:32. So? I was out running yesterday, and an intersec car cuts me off, racing to biodesign. Well, I always finish my run at 7:30, right? Yeah. So, then how could he have called me if intersec has already responded, presumably, to the murder call? Good morning, ladies! Are we online today? Spare some change, mister? [Dance music plays] A pleasure. I didn't get any pleasure. Have a nice time, you pervert? TV evangelist: You will be able to walk in the straight and the narrow path to freedom and to paradise, because I'm telling you, brothers, I'm telling you, sisters, that if you believe in him, whether you're a sinner or whether you're not a sinner, because we're all sinners in our soul-- in our soul, we're all sinners-- but if you dig deep enough and you pray to the lord, and you ask Jesus for your health... [Guard pacing] He will help you to grow into something really beautiful, and it will make you worthy of that paradise to come, that wonderful joy, and one day... Computer: Generalized system failure. Computer: Generalized system failure. Reload program. Computer: Generalized system failure. Check for excluded hardware. Check for excluded hardware. Generalized system failure. Reload program. Check for excluded hardware. Generalized system failure. Reload program. Check for excluded hardware. Generalized system failure. [Soothing music playing] Well? We're online. I'm so proud of you. Computer: Test sequence activated. Stand by. Stand by. Stand by. Test sequence completed. Kat: We did it. They're perfect, ludo! Each stone is identical, brilliant, perfect. Well, which one's the original? They're both authentic. Now the lab tests each sample for comparisons with the original. Fine. Fine. Fine. Let's run the other test. We should conclude the comparisons first. What other test? Kat, what other test? It's all right. It's just a simple living organism, that's all. No. It's ok. We talked-- you can't just-- why not? Because this is not designed to replicate living organisms. Now, we did talk about this-- slow down. Now, is there any scientific reason why we can't replicate our furry little friend here? It's too complex. Even if every atom was correctly decoded and recreated, it won't replicate living neural activity-- too much theory. Let's just try it and see what happens. Go on. You! Can you run this thing? No. I'm...I'm new here. I do know how to work the coffee machine, though. Frick and frack, can you clowns do it? You--do it. Unless the girls here change their minds. Please, Scott, don't... See how much he loves you? Computer: Second test sequence activated. Stand by. Stand by. Stand by. Test sequence completed. [Squeaking] Absolutely brilliant. Pure genius. You guys are great. Hey... Come here, little guy. Ow! [Drops cages] [Hissing] Frick, frack, out! Kat: Calm down, Scott. Ok, this was premature... We never held out hopes to replicate living organisms. What about human tissue? Well, soon. You led me to believe that we were ready. You promised. Now I'm gonna ask you... Once again, when? I'll think about it. "I'll think about it." Scott: Do you realize how long "I'll think about it" means... To someone who needs surgery with replicated tissue? Do you?! You've... You've been cooped up in this lab for too long. You have lost touch with the world's needs. Now, if it were you... Would you want to wait? If you needed... Reconstructive surgery? Hmm? Hmm? If I cut her up... Deep...right here... Would you understand the unbelievable urgency then? Hmm? Hmm? Answer me! No! I'll kill you! Aah! Ha ha ha! Ooh! Ohh! The replikator project is over, Scott. We're gone. Get the disks. The disks stay here. Ciao, girls. [Rock music plays] Hyaaah! Hey, Victor. Yeah? Hey, that street kid of yours got out real fast, man. Ludo? No. No. He's in steyer. It sure looked like him to me. Fight at the night scene, got away. It wasn't ludo. He's in steyer. I was just over there, ok? Yeah, sure, Victor. He did it. He actually did it. Ludo ludovic. They can't seem to rehabilitate you, can they? A shame, really. You're so gifted. What are you doing here? You can get out tonight, pursuing science at zyklor tomorrow. Well, thank you, Scott, but I already have a job. I don't think so. Bar design's a crime scene. It's an empty shell. And you can make me free. Fortuitous, isn't it? [Chuckles] Let me get this straight. I come and work for you at zyklor, or stay here and... Rot in this cell. I don't know, Scott. Sounds like about the same thing to me. Do you know your friend John's working for US? That's right. Tch. I'd hate to make him responsible for the failure of our replikator program. No. No. Scott. He--he doesn't know anything, Scott. Hey... Hey! Heck, yeah. Hey. Bor-ing. Here, how about this? Uh-uh-uh. Whoo! [Cocks shotgun] You're sick. Well, she's no Tina show. Get out. She's no high towers. Hey, have a nice time, you pervert? Can you spare some change? [Dog whimpers] Uh-uh-uh. Not so fast. What are you gonna give me in return? Hmm? Oh. Ha ha! Ha! No way, mister. This is my dog. Why do you care? Why do you care?! What--hey, look-- that's my dog! You come back with my dog! Now what? Whoa... My replikator disks... The backups... Computer: Software incompatibility. Sequence aborted. Software incompatibility. Sequence aborted. Software incompatibility. Sequence override. Sequence failure imminent. Sequence failure imminent. Sequence failure... The problem is... Sequence failure imminent. The whole... Is more... Sequence failure imminent... Than the sum of its parts. Illegal override. Caution... Program failure imminent... Caution... More... Perhaps... Caution... Program failure imminent... But not better. Program failure imminent... Shut up! Program failure imminent... Caution... Program failure imminent... Caution... You should've finished the job, ludovic. Caution... Program failure imminent... Caution... Program failure imminent... Caution... Program failure imminent... [Telephone buzzes] Valiant. Woman: Valiant? Yeah. Listen to me and listen carefully. Yeah! I just saw ludovic on the street. No-- did you really think you could get away with this? I've had it with you and your... Liberal bleeding-heart judges-- ludo ludovic happens to be resting comfortably in steyer prison-- steyer prison! Did you really think you could get away with this? I know that for a fact! Ludo, it seems you've been, uh... Getting around lately. What do you mean? Why, I ask myself... Is it a long-lost twin? Is there a ludo look-alike fan club? That's what I was afraid of. Look... I don't know what went wrong. All I know is, he's a monster. You got to help me get out of here, Victor. You got to help me find him. Announcer: Citizens are frantic as an unidentified fashion fiend cuts a swath of destruction through town. The foppish criminal counts theft, violence, and snappy getaways among his anti-civic traits. The justice channel says, keep your eyes open and report this man if you see him. Remember, the justice channel is your pulse on public security. Ah, Victor. Good. About the inquiries you've made in the last 24 hours... Your request for most recent financial statements and listing of the board of directors of zyklor... Denied. Request for transport log sheet and activity report for the last 2 weeks from zyklor security... Denied. Request to reopen sealed government files which document the purported activities of one Byron Scott, 1996-2004... Denied. Oh, and one final directive. As of tomorrow morning, you will be removed from the biodesign investigation and assigned elsewhere. You may, if you wish, file a grievance with our internal board of inquiry, which will, I can assure you, receive my prompt and serious attention. Good-bye, Victor. You know of anyone who might want to do this? An old boyfriend, perhaps? No. Ok. We'll file a report, but these cases usually go unsolved. Kathy moskow? Yes? You guys finished? Yeah. Basically. I'm Victor. I know. You arrested ludovic years ago on that forgery thing. Ludo's in trouble. Again. Except this time, I don't think he did it. Well, so far, I agree with you. Why should we trust him? Because I think you two may be in more trouble than you think you are. Kathy? Boo! Ha ha ha ha! What's the matter, were you expecting somebody else? Ha ha! What have you done with her? Relax. I haven't touched her. I just came to ask you one question. When you first saw me... I could tell you were afraid. Is that because I was the same... Or because I was different? I don't know. Look at me, ludo. What do you see? Because I see you... Pathetic, weak, afraid. And then I realize... I'm the one who's suited for this world, and you're the freak. Ciao, ludo. [Typing] Computer: Accessing record of parolee ludovic. Ludovic. 27. [Typing] This is so unfair. Thanks. I'll call you as soon as I know anything. No. I'm gonna go with you. I can't just sit around here-- no. No. You go with your family in the skirts. They've been informed. I've got enough to do keeping my eyes on these guys. You'll call me? I promise. Ok. Bye. Didn't think this one would make bail. Parolee ludovic traveling. P.A.: Ludovic traveling. You live here? Yeah. Why? This place is worse than jail. It was a joke. Just a joke. I've got somebody here I think can help US. John? Hi. That's for all the trouble you've been causing. Again. Ludo. Is this gonna be ok? Ok? This is gonna be great. Chief. What can I do for you? I don't know, Scott. What can you do? Expect a positive attitude from all my associates, chief. I've got a cop with a positive attitude, Scott. His name is Valiant, and he's following the trail of your incompetence right to US. One damn killing after another, no replikator online, no commerce, no confidence-- not in you or your promises. Your cop is your problem. As for the replikator, it will be up and running soon. I've heard too many fairy tales, Scott. You told me you were ready. You're not. Shame, really. Changed your mind. Wrong. Ludovic is still in prison. Ha. Ha ha. Think, Scott. Think the unthinkable. Think...replikator. You're a copy? No. I'm better. Stronger. Superior. You and I think alike. Your replikator works. Till your flunkies trashed it. Sorry. It was just business. Anyway, I've come here to make a deal. I'm listening. Put me in charge of your replikator program. What are you getting in return? Nothing. Nothing? What about your schizophrenic other? I'll Bury him. In that case... We have a deal. Bonsoir. Ludo! Ha ha ha! Your shadow... Swipes Kat's back-up tapes and tries again, unsuccessfully, to get the replikator to work. Why? 'Cause he's an egomaniac and he wants to recreate himself. Well, maybe he's just trying to understand what makes him different. Maybe he's lonely. You're kidding, right? He needs a replikator that works, so... Zyklor. Him and Scott. What a nightmare. [Whistles] Would ya look at this. Huh. Yes. You kids ever do any...Cryptic crosswords? My wife used to do 'em all the time, bless her. You know, I've been looking into these... Extremist...gangs... [Sighs] Ok. If you do a cryptic of lord falcon, you get...Byron Scott. So? There's more to this Scott guy than meets the eye. Yeah. Yeah. Here. "The secretary for industry and technology, Byron Scott, "was named as a key suspect in the illegal distribution of the drug virtualitol." Wow. And this was 10 years ago. There's more. "Cleared of all allegations, Byron Scott issued a statement through his lawyer." You recognize him? The lawyer? Yeah. No. That's chief reinhart! You mean the cops that attacked biodesign were working for Scott? Somebody wanted to take your replikator program out, so-- why would the chief be involved? Cops covering for cops covering for zyklor? What a mess. Computer: Human format program completed. Do you wish to download the human format program ludo? Yes. Software downloading. Ludo replication program complete. It's perfect. It's perfect. One original... And... One...big...bad... Virus. Computer: Warning. Virus program grafting to master human format software. John! Yes, ludo? It's done. Tell Scott. I got a date. I'll see ya later. Ladies and gentlemen, I have some good news and some bad news. The bad news is miss Tina show has a case of laryngitis and unfortunately will not be able to sing for US this evening. The good news is, who cares? [Rim shot] No, but seriously, folks, hang on to your hats. [Rim shot] Hang on to your zippers. The high towers proudly presents the blonde Venus of sensuality... The one, the only, miss Tina show! [Jazzy music plays] Bravo! Bravo, bravo! Bravo! I'm just up here. I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for this moment. I'll be back. [Belches] Evian, please. Hi, John. I've got a message from a friend. Ludo, liebchen, may I please have some champagne? Hmm? Here. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Come here, baby. Ludo, this is not some rotten whorehouse. Ow! He's out there functioning contrary to the rules of any science I understand. Ok, it's just like the mouse, remember? So maybe he's on the same edge, some sort of freaky balance between forces that can't hold a pattern for any time, an accident just waiting to fall apart. [Tina screams] Ludo's double has brought the replikator to a very sophisticated level. Why? What's Scott trying to do? Maybe I could go back and drop in a virus, buy some time. No way. You are persona non grata at zyklor. I could do it. What if they see you? They won't. No one works late at the lab. Ok, but you be careful. I'm gonna meet you back here. In an hour. Announcer: Intersect video catches killer escaping moments after murder of Tina show. Mayhem marks the high towers as ludo ludovic, already a suspect in the slaying of Cecilia masters, roamed free on bail and not in jail. Tina, star of stage and vr, was stabbed to death during a private performance. Intersec asks you to report this man. The justice channel asks, isn't it time to replace the liberal bleeding hearts running our parole boards? Zyklor. The tower is a back up. It's also the most secure place in the complex. Intersec figures if... That's where he's gonna hold out if he's under attack. Wow. It's almost like he knew this was gonna happen. Hmm. It's just what it's like. Be vigilant. This calm can be very deceiving. Keep it running. I got one more thing I still gotta do. Jeez. Come on, John. Working late, John? How ironic. You'll make a fine specimen. Surprise, Scott. [Knock on window] You're working late, Valiant. Oh, yeah. Ha ha. You, too, huh? Come up to my office. Uh, sure. News flash, inspector. Tonight we arrest Byron Scott for the biodesign murders. Just like that. Your evidence supports a...Parallel investigation. You were right. The man is dangerous. It's time to take him. I see. We don't necessarily expect zyklor security forces to respect lawful authority. It could get...Messy. Computer: Replication program failure. Check for peripheral software area. Stand by. Stand by. Replication program failure. Check for peripheral software error. Oh! Do it again. Replication error... Test sequence activated. Check for peripheral... Stand by. Software error. Stand by. Replication program failure. Check for peripheral software error. Yeah, it's me. [Sighs] Leave a message. Maybe I'll get back to you. Ha ha. Hi. It's me. Where are you guys? Um, John went to the lab to fix things, and he hasn't come back. I can't wait anymore. So I'm gonna go after him. Ok? Thanks. Look! I don't want to be the one to tell Scott that this isn't working! Try something different! 4 replicants. 4 failures. They're guessing. How long? 5...6 minutes. And then they die. You're sitting in my chair. Kathy: Ludo! Computer: Warning. Zyklor security periphery breached. [Gasps] Hello, Kat. Closing in on the tower. This is a power play, ok? I mean, if they take out Scott, they control the replikator. Ok, I'm goin' after Kat. Go! We meet on the perimeter at 3:45. All right? On the perimeter. Go save the girl! What am I supposed to feel? I don't know. What do you feel? I feel sick! We invented the replikator, Kathy. These... Are our children. And I will not let humans destroy them. What are you gonna do? Whatever it takes. But-- ciao, Kat. Computer: Warning. Zyklor security perimeter breached. [Laughs] [Alarm sounding] P.A.: Byron Scott. This is intersec. You are under arrest. Tell your security forces to stand down and give yourself up. [Telephone rings] Yes? No. Listen to me. I am the falcon, and I demand their total annihilation. Is that understood? Ha ha ha! Ooh-wah! And again. And again! Ah ha ha ha ha ha! How do you like being buried alive, Scotty boy? Stop it! [Screeching] Stop! Stop! Stop! Ah ha ha ha ha! Ludo! We can work together on this. Just...get me outta here! [Mimicking] Outta here! Get me outta here! Ah ha ha ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha ha ha! [Tinny sound] Ha ha ha! Stop, stop, stop! Ah ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! How do you like being buried alive? Stop it! Ha ha ha ha ha! How do you like being buried alive? Stop it! You got a lot of good software. [Tinny sound] How do you like being buried alive, Scotty boy? Ludo! [Crying] [Coughing] Appears you have a... Standoff on your hands, chief. On the contrary, I have Mr. Scott exactly where I want him. I think the situation would be best served if you intervene as our negotiator. So, you get to play the hero again. P.A.: Byron Scott, this is intersec. We are sending in a negotiator. Hold your fire. That doesn't sound right. Look! I'm gonna follow him. No-- stay here. Stay here. Hello! Byron Scott, this is intersec. We are sending in a negotiator. Hold your fire. Chief: Get me demolitions. I want that tower blown sky high. Mr. Scott. Hold your fire. Press the button. What about the inspector? Oh, he'll get a company funeral. Move it, Victor! Move it, move it! ...buried alive? Stop it! Give it to me. Aah! Victor! Did you really think you could take over, chief? [Gunshot] Announcer: Sunrise at 6:43 eastern standard time. Radiation hazard as of 7:32. Remember to wear protective clothes and avoid sunlight. Today's high... Man has become... Immortal. [Laughing] All right, brother! Ha ha ha! You wanna play? Ha ha ha! All right, let's go! You're not down yet, huh? Ok, ludo, let's see if you got the guts to end the beginning, huh? This is the end of the game, ludovic. Don't do this to US. No escape, ludovic. And you're comin' down with me! What do I do now? Huh? [Shouting] What do I do now?! Announcer: Intersec stops insurrection, seeking arrest of Byron Scott. Scott's real identity is lord falcon, leader of the new destiny underground. Falcon was turning replication technology to the production of a superior race. Falcon was also named in the murder of Cecilia masters, having framed ludo ludovic in the killing. Intersec's Victor Valiant barely escaped the battle, but verifies ludovic's innocence of charges against him. Ludovic's crimes, perpetrated by his twin replicant, killed in a horrific helicopter crash. Valiant is said to have declined intersec's offer to assume the mantle of chief of police.

Did we come at a bad time? No, it's all right. No, it's all right. Thank you, Victor. That's very sweet. Thank you, Victor. That's very sweet. Victor: Here's to... The unemployed. I have an idea. How about if we all go... To another city and start over? All the decent cities are halfway around the world. And what if... Money wasn't a problem? You didn't. No. No. I live by the rules now. Good. Well, I broke one. It's the replikator disk. Always back up your work. Well, what do you say, uh... I'd say we're back in business. Hey. Will this buy me in? Partners? All: Partners! Ludo: Now, one thing bothers me. He must have known he was falling apart, right? So when he perfected the replication program-- Kathy: Why didn't he replicate himself over again? Ludo: I would have. Victor: Oh, no. Not again.
