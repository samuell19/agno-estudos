TWO WOMEN A FEW HOURS EARLIER ARRAS COURTHOUSE NOVEMBER 12TH 1965 THIS STORY IS BASED ON A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE WHICH SHOOK THE COUNTRY IN 1965. THE DEATH PENALTY WAS STILL IN FORCE AND ABORTION WAS ILLEGAL. No. What is it? -Stop. -What about the hotel? We need to end this. Why? It is not you... I just don't want to do this anymore. We can be more discreet, I promise! Please. I can't stop! You are different from other women. -You are so... -Don't! I need to see you, Colette. Please. Don't make this harder than it is. Colette! -Are you sure? -Go! Colette, can we can still be friends? Yes, of course. -Good afternoon, ma'am. -Good afternoon. -How are you, Françoise? -I'm OK. -Shall we? -Yes. -Thank you, Solange! -See you tomorrow! No, please. No charge. -Hello, Colette. -Hello. Good afternoon. -Good afternoon, Doctor. -Good afternoon, Ma'am. Have a seat to the right. Your name is Françoise? -My daughter is... -Forgive me, but I really need your daughter to tell me herself, ma'am. How are you feeling? I'm a little scared. Quite understandable. But there is no need to worry. Does it hurt? There will be some pain, but the procedure is very fast. Tell me why you do not want this baby. Because I am not in love. It was an accident. But I do want a family, when I'm older. You will be perfectly able to have children later. When you are ready. Shall we? Good afternoon. Rinacci. Bust-up in the Arab community. Camise. Embezzlement in a garage. And for you, Leroux... Nothing! Get to work, gentlemen! DESMETS BANK Mr. Bonnefond! -Good afternoon, Mrs. Chevreau! -Good afternoon! Would it be possible to schedule a meeting for me and my husband to talk about the shop? Of course! It won't be before Friday though. By the way, I have been dying to ask... That vehicle of yours... It must easily go up to 94 miles! Ah! I couldn't possibly say. I'm hardly a connoisseur when it comes to mileage! Of course, women usually aren't. Yes, that must be it. In any case, I could hardly afford a vehicle like that! 6 p.m.! I'm late for my evening rounds! Stop by, Friday. We shall. My regards, Mrs. Chevreau! Mr. Bonnefond! You can see the timer through the viewfinder. Then you have the rangefinder coupled with a diamond shaped focal point -and the flash... -Great, thanks. Good afternoon. -I will think about it. -Good. -See you soon. -Goodbye. -Excuse me! -Thank you. -Hello, darling. -Hello. How did it go with Mrs. Marqueuil? Good. She has hired me for her daughter's wedding photos. I just ran into Bonnefond, I got us an appointment for Friday. Excellent. No running down the stairs! Mommy! -Hello, my darlings. -Hi, Mom! -Did you have a good day? -Yes, thank you. -And you? -Good. Have you finished your homework? -Yes, all done! -Very good. Off upstairs to play. -Mommy and I are going out. -We did French and Math. Forget it guys, it is bust! -Here you go! -Thanks. -Well, look who it is! -Hello. Hello. -The usual, you lovebirds? -Yes, please! Colette is a lovely woman, isn't she? Sure. And Pierre is such a lovely man. Do you think I'm blind, Robert? You are sleeping with her. Don't be ridiculous! I have seen the way you look at her! You are screwing her! Stop it, someone might hear you! That's all you care about? You can make me look like a fool, but Mr. Gendarme mustn't tarnish -his goddamn reputation! -That's enough! I'm warning you... I forgave you once, I won't do it again. You cheat on me again, I will leave you and take the children with me. Were you with her this afternoon? For God's sake! No, I wasn't with her! -Don't you know where I was? -No. Does Saint-Quentin cemetery ring any bells? See? Thanks for remembering the anniversary of my mother's death! Afternoon, Mr. Réfabert! Sorry I'm late. Your farm... Good morning, gentlemen. Morning. Poor bastard! What time did you find him? 10 a.m. We had just come back from chopping wood... Anything else? OK. Don't touch anything. I need to call the Prosecutor. I just wanted to brighten up the place. Homicide case. Banker from Desmets Bank found burned to death in his car in Saint-Léonard. A real backwater place. Camise and Rinacci are already swamped so... But I'm putting a top dog on the case. Commissioner Faureins from the Arras police and his team. I don't trust backwater cops! You will rely entirely on him. Understood? Yes, sir. Berthelot! Boss? Tell Arras to get me two extra phone lines. We are going to need them! On it, boss. No hard feelings about me taking the case? Of course not, Commissioner. Don't worry, I will have this case solved in no time! I will be out your hair soon! Of course, sir. Here we are. Ah, there you are darling. Congratulations! Did you know there are only six female magistrates in France? Yes, Dad. George, please! -What? -Thank you. Could you not talk about work during dinner? I'm not, I'm talking about our daughter. Lord, please bless this meal and those who prepared it. And fill the bellies of those who have none. -Amen. -Amen. Amen. I thought we could invite Gérard Le Gall and his parents over on Sunday. Who? You know, the young engineer who works for the oil company. -Oh... -My dear... Stop bothering her with that. I can't even try and set my own daughter up? No, you can't! And why not? She has other things to think about right now. More important than finding herself a nice man? Listen, I dedicated my life to my magistrate career. I got married at 40, and I am doing quite well. And so are you! It is her life, her career. You are the first examining magistrate to work on a homicide. What if I can't handle it? Of course you can! You are going to solve this case, and in a few years' time, you will be the first female president of the Regional Court! I think Gérard would be delighted to celebrate with you, this Sunday. Lunch or dinner? Neither! It fell on the floor! Christophe, quit it! I didn't do it! Christophe, that's enough. Are you almost done, darling? Yes. Do some coloring! So... "I wish you had..." Known. Very good. Known, like a gnome? No, silly! "Known" starts with a "k." And if you look in the dictionary, gnome starts with the letter... ? -"G?" -Correct. How do you know all this, Mommy? Cause Mom graduated from school. Which is why you have to work hard and do your homework, so you can all graduate too! No one seems to have money issues in this godforsaken place! Pity. That has to be the reason they offed the guy, for money! He had 10,000 francs in his satchel, but no sign of the money when we found the car. We have been looking since yesterday and we found bubkes! We asked all the locals he met on his rounds and no one saw him, He must have been invisible! I am sick and tired of these backwater dumps! As soon this case is done, I'm heading back to Paris! Hey Berthelot, check this out. My, my, my! Bonnefond's colleagues said he was reserved, but he was quite the dark horse! And quite the artist! I'm going to make dinner. GRISLY MURDER OF BANKER BONNEFOND I hope your commissioner finds the guy who did this. I liked Bonnefond. First of all, he isn't my commissioner. And, he doesn't seem to be finding much right now! -Hello, Marc! -Hi, Colette. Coffee, please. -Hello, Robert. -Hello, Colette. What are you doing here by yourself? My civic duty, Robert! What do you mean? The papers said Bonnefond was murdered at 5 p.m. Who on earth told them that? I did, ma'am. -Ma'am. -Hello, sir. Commissioner André Faureins, Arras Police Force. Colette Chevreau, business-owner. I am in charge of this case. She is the photographer's wife. Please! Thank you. Yeah, I'm sure. Everyone in Saint-Léonard knows him. Have a seat. So... You claim to know better than a medical examiner? Heavens, no. I wouldn't dare be so presumptuous. I am simply saying that on the day of the murder, I ran into Mr. Bonnefond coming out of the bank at 6 p.m., and he was still very much alive. Are you absolutely sure? Oh, yes. I am certain of it. Very well. We shall investigate. Thank you for helping make up from the police's mistakes. "For." -Pardon me? -"For the mistakes." Not "from." Ah yes, very good. Quite right. Let me walk you out. -Have a good day, gentlemen! -See you, Colette. You know her? A bit, I have seen her around. Is your wife like that, Ferrand? God, no! Boss. Phone for you. The examining magistrate. Female magistrate! They gave me a woman. I'm wasting my time being here in your office. I appreciate the summons, but I would be much better at Saint-Léonard working on the case! I have already wasted enough time as it is going through all the damn testimonies. Those who didn't see a thing, and an interfering woman who says she saw the banker alive when he was already dead! The coroner is certain. He died at 5 p.m. Do you have a lead? Yeah. The banker was killed for the money. Does that shock you? Get used to it. You get plenty of that with this job. The banker had a mistress, he drew pictures of her when he wasn't filling out bank statements. She is the one we have to find, she is the one who did it. I have seen it many times in my long career. Mistress kills the poor bastard for his money. She may have had an accomplice, I haven't worked that out yet. But she knew where her lover would be that day. She followed him, and pocketed the 10,000 francs. Don't you worry, I will find her. Have a nice day, Your Honor. Commissioner. -Commissioner? -Good evening, ma'am! I... Excuse me... Please, do come in! Where were you the afternoon of the murder? I beg your pardon? You alone? No kids, husband? Now, wait a minute... -How well did you know Bonnefond? -Your cigarette! Thank you. Not much. No more than everyone else. Ah, so you were his mistress. My condolences. Kept you in pretty outfits, did he? -Excuse me? -Your fancy creams. And you killed him. Why? I had nothing to do with Mr. Bonnefond's death, and you should not be here. Then why did you come to see me yesterday? -To help with the investigation! -"To help with the investigation!" "I didn't kill him," "I had nothing to do with it, bla bla bla..." You are starting to get on my nerves, Mrs. Chevreau. With your superior airs. This is not the Académie française, we are talking about premeditated murder. And you will answer an officer of the law's questions! Now, where were you that afternoon, and with who? My private life is none of your concern. If you refuse to answer, I will find out eventually. A woman like you... I bet you have a ton of secrets, don't you? Why did you lie to me? You do know Colette Chevreau. No, I don't. Cut the crap, Ferrand! You are lovers, and you were with her in Arras when the banker was killed. Unbelievable. You took the words right out of my mouth. Now... spill. Why did Colette say that? She is lying. We did see her that day, both of us. Around 6:30 in the evening I think it was, we went for a drink at the bar du Centre. 6:30. You sure? Yes. Ask Marc. He's the boss. Actually, it was later. Closer to 7 p.m... right, Robert? Yes, around seven. And where had she been? She didn't say. We didn't ask. We are not especially close. Besides, we had just returned from the cemetery. We spent the whole day at my in-law's tombstones in Saint-Quentin. It was the anniversary of my mother-in-law's death. What is going on? The photographer's wife has been taking us for a ride. She is a smart one. First, she tries to muddy the waters by telling me she saw the banker at 6 p.m., which is impossible because he was already dead by then. And then, when that doesn't work, she tells me she was with Ferrand. Except Ferrand was with his wife. Let me tell you what I think happened. She offed the banker, her lover, at 5 p.m. Then she took her sweet time and made her way to the bar for a drink with her husband at 7 p.m. Give herself an alibi. Damn... Why did she say she was with Ferrand? Because she was also screwing him. She thought he would cover for her. Oh yeah... That woman probably has several lovers on the go. Oh Colette, it is you! -Come in. -Hello. Is something wrong? The police came to question me about my whereabouts last Monday. The police? Don't worry, it had nothing to do with us. They were asking me questions about a murder. Murder? Sit down, please. -What murder? -Bonnefond, the banker who was killed at Saint-Léonard. When I saw in the paper the police had the time of death wrong, I went to see them and told them it was impossible because I ran into him at 6 p.m. coming back from Arras. I thought it was the right thing to do. But now, the commissioner is acting very odd with me. For some reason, he believes I killed the man. So... I told him I was in Arras that day.... Wait, what did you tell him exactly? Nothing about our operation. I told him I was with a gendarme, he will cover for me. You were with a gendarme? Colette... What in the world do you mean? I'm a little confused, here. He was my lover. We were going to a hotel, except I planned to end things, and I did. And then I came here with Françoise as scheduled. What on earth were you thinking, Colette? You are a part of a clandestine abortion network, and you are sleeping with a cop! Colette... You are putting us all in great danger! We risk up to 15 years if we are caught. Not just the doctors like me, go-betweens like you and the women we help! Which is why I told the police about my affair! I took no pleasure in doing so! But I did it to protect us, all of us! I would never tell, you know that! Yes, of course... Forgive me... OK. Thank you for coming to tell me. You should go home. Go home, Colette. Are you OK? Are you sure? The boss and I were talking about it... We ain't complaining though... See ya, Paulo! It is good publicity for the town... -Gentlemen! -Hey there, Commissioner! Anyway... I know I am on duty, but I will have a pastis. The day of the murder... Did Colette Chevreau come here for a drink with her husband? Yeah, I think so... What time? Don't know, there was a lot of people. I don't check what time they come in! And what is Colette like? Do you know her well? She is a nice lady. Is she, now? Yes... Some say she is a bit stuck-up, but I don't agree. Quite the show-off, is she? I never said that. I just said she was nice. Commissioner? That will be 1.50 francs. Berthelot? Yeah, boss? Time for Phase Two... You got it, boss! Would you call Mrs. Chevreau a fickle person? When it comes to men, sure. Not that it is any of my concern... Do you often see her flirting with men? Well, she is a very elegant woman. Always smart, neat, presentable. Desirable. So you are saying she might easily skip town? Oh no! She is a loyal customer. I see... -Have a nice day, ma'am! -And you, sir! Do you think she and Bonnefond were... What? Her and the banker? Wouldn't put it past her. And if so, he's not the only one. But you didn't hear that from me. Right? Of course, ma'am. Goodbye, ladies. Thank you for your help. Bye! Do you know Colette Chevreau well? The photographer's wife? That will be 50 cents. Oh, sure. You business-owners are a tight-knit group. Oh no, Colette isn't like us. What do you mean? -We don't really know her that well. -Really? And why is that? Well... she is not like us... She isn't from here, and she has airs about her. And money. No one knows how, though. Have you seen her car? And her clothes? Don't know where she gets the money, but it isn't the photography shop! I see. Thank you for being so helpful. Of course, Commissioner. Coming! Take your time, Mr. Chevreau. What are you doing? Inspector Berthelot. Do you have a safe? A safe? Yeah, where you store your money. My money? What is this about? Put my wife's photo down! Ah yes, speaking of your wife... Know where she was the day of Bonnefond's murder? No. Why? You don't know what your wife does all day? No, I don't stalk her. Not the jealous type, huh? Look. I don't know why you are here nor what it has to do with my wife. Is she here? She went out. Now, what is going on? I will tell you. But in exchange, hand this over to your little woman. -What is it? -Read the envelope. Were you sleeping with Bonnefond? Of course not! Why would you say that? You sleep with other men because you no longer -desire me... -No, Pierre... We had an agreement. We said we would never speak of it again. SUMMONS Robert was my lover. It was only a few times, and it is over now. I was never in love with him just like I will never be in love with anyone else. You are the only man I love, Pierre. I wasn't sleeping with the banker. And I didn't kill anyone. You believe me, don't you Pierre? Yeah. Ready? -Hi. -Hello, Marc. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Vandelle. Get home safe. Mrs. Chevreau? Just your wife. Commissioner. Gentlemen, leave us. Have a seat. No, thank you. What brand of perfume are you wearing, Mrs. Chevreau? Would you be so kind as to tell me why I have been summoned? A luxury brand, I imagine. Just like your creams. What did you do with the 10,000 francs, Mrs. Chevreau? You know perfectly well I had nothing to do with Mr. Bonnefond's death. The hell I do! I know Lieutenant Ferrand was not with you the day of the murder... because he was with his wife. Then he is lying. We were together in Arras. Were you now? Robert Ferrand, a gendarme with an impeccable reputation, is lying? His wife too? Because it couldn't possibly be you, could it! Let me tell you what I think. The banker was your lover, so you knew he was off on his rounds with 10,000 francs on him. So, you lured him into an ambush on his way to Bois de la Cambre. That is absurd, absolutely and utterly absurd. How do you expect a woman weighing 120 pounds to kill a man and burn his car? What do you think? Those drawings are obscene and vulgar. I see a certain resemblance... That is ridiculous... That woman looks nothing like me. I will say it again. On the day of the murder, I was coming back from Arras where I had met up with Robert Ferrand. When I got to Saint-Léonard, I parked in front of Desmets Bank, behind my home. I ran into Mr. Bonnefond as he was leaving at 6 p.m. We even exchanged a few words. Then I went to my husband's shop and we came here for a drink. Ask anyone. Ask Marc. Everyone will confirm it. Thank you for the advice, ma'am. I have in fact spoken to a few people. The baker. The greengrocer. The bar owner. Nothing but gossip and nonsense! Gossip and nonsense... I have had enough! Berthelot, take her! What are you doing? Let go of me! -Come on! -How dare you! What is going on? Where are you taking her? Where are you taking her? -Stay back, Chevreau! -Colette! Look after the children. Don't worry... Everything will be all right... No alibi... Cash problems, and I have it on good authority she was sleeping with the banker. She is in custody, I give it 24 hours before she confesses. 48 hours before this case is solved. You have indeed compiled a plethora of testimonies and accusations against this Colette Chevreau... I can't help but think however you seem to be focusing entirely on her. I see no mention of any other theories. How dare you! Who do you think you are? I have been in this job 25 years, solved dozens of cases like this, and you have the nerve to tell me how to do my job! Not only do I have a great deal of evidence concerning Mrs. Chevreau, but my intuition has never let me down. Never! Good day, sir. Commissioner? Prosecutor. I'm not going to lie, I am deeply troubled by this Bonnefond case. Deeply troubled. How can I put this... I received a few phone calls from the top brass. Paris has got their own problems to deal with. Are you aware of the Ben Barka matter? Of course. They are hoping the murder of the banker makes a lot of noise, smothers the impending political scandal. Do you understand? Perfectly. Can I rely on you? Absolutely, sir. Commissioner. Hello, my love. Guess what? What, dear? We shall soon be heading back to Paris. I received orders all the way from the top. Oh dear... I won't have any time to prepare for our move. Easy, girl! What are we having tonight? Your favorite, filet mignon. Delicious! May I have a few toiletries, please? Toiletries, you say? OK. I will have someone bring them... But first... Tell me about you. Who are you? How did you end up in a backwater place like Saint-Léonard? Help me out here, Mrs. Chevreau. I need to fill in the gaps. This case, your case... It is keeping me up at night... I can't sleep, I can't eat. I worked as a saleswoman in a luxury department store in Arras. I had dropped out of university. Pierre and I had always wanted to open up a photography shop. He... He was an apprentice photographer at the time. We had just had our first child, Éric. And... Why Saint-Léonard? After a few years in Arras, we started looking for our shop. And we found the perfect one here. But... How on earth could you afford it? My father left me a rather large sum of money when he died. Allowing us to buy the shop and settle here. So you paid for the shop? Yes, everything is in my name. The shop, the apartment, the car... Don't tell me, that also pays for your fancy perfumes and dresses. Yes, exactly. We are in no need of money, the inheritance is more than enough. Enough for me to treat myself, my husband, and my children. So if you are accusing me of killing the banker for his money, then you are gravely, gravely mistaken. What about your lovers, Mrs. Chevreau? There must be some truth to what we were told. Village gossip. The people of Saint-Léonard like to talk... about things they know nothing about. Besides, my love life has nothing to do with money. Nor with murder. Fine! So Ferrand was with you in Arras the day of the murder. What were the two of you up to? We would meet up on a Monday and go to a hotel. Which hotel? -Hôtel des Flandres. -Hôtel des Flandres, huh? Good, I will confirm that with them right away. We didn't go there, that day. How convenient! I refused, because I wanted to end the affair. I told him it was over. And of course, no one saw you in Arras. The locals saw you with Bonnefond in Saint-Léonard but no one saw you in Arras the day he died! A little unbelievable, wouldn't you say? What were you doing, Mrs. Chevreau? I was... Yes? Where did you go, Mrs. Chevreau? Why do you continue to lie to me? Because the truth is... You killed Bonnefond so you could keep providing for your luxury lifestyle! I have money! Then you wanted more! You needed more! What are you doing here? I'm here to see Colette Chevreau. I am about to break her, I will not let you-- I am in charge of this case, and I wish to see the defendant. Thank you. Good day, ma'am. My name is Ms. Leroux, I'm the examining magistrate for this case. I came to check you are being treated well. I didn't do it. I didn't kill anyone. The investigation will determine that, ma'am. Get me the chief editor of La Voix du Nord. Yes, right now... Yes, I will hold... Hello? -Robert? -Speaking. -It is me. -Ah, Commissioner. -What can I do for you? -I got a story for you. -The Colette Chevreau case? -You heard about it! -Of course! -Then it is full steam ahead. -Duly noted. I will tell the team. -Good. -Front page tomorrow. -Thank you. -My pleasure. -I owe you one. Goodbye, Commissioner. It is too hot, Daddy. It will cool down. Here, darling. Have a good day at school, Éric! Mommy's ones are better. She will be back soon, darling... Here... Dad! What is it, son? COLETTE THE DEVIL A demon, that one... Did you see what they wrote? Colette is no saint.. Unacceptable! I hope she gets the guillotine! Always knew she was odd... I'm not worried about her... What are you saying? You don't know what you are talking about! Defending your precious Colette! Don't be ridiculous! She is just a client! Sure, sure... I see how you look at her... Shut up! What is going on outside? The reporters! Everyone knew she and Bonnefond were lovers. We have something to say! We know Colette too. Can you tell me what you told Inspector Berthelot? I... I saw the banker in his car with the photographer's wife. You mean you saw Colette Chevreau with Mr. Bonnefond, in his car on the day of the murder just before 5 p.m.? Yes. And you are certain it was the banker. Yes, they were in his car. And they were headed for Bois de la Cambre. Yes. And there was no one else in the car. No. Good... Just sign the statement and you can go. New testimony. Now you have everything you need to charge Colette Chevreau. What are you still doing up? Colette Chevreau risks the guillotine, Dad. All right... What do you have to work with? A witness who formally stated she saw Colette Chevreau in the banker's automobile a few minutes before the crime, headed toward Bois de la Cambre where the burned car was found. On top of that, it was public knowledge that she was his mistress. And her only alibi has now fallen to pieces. Finally, most importantly, she tried to sway the investigation by insisting on several occasions that the time of death was incorrect. What more do you need? Solid evidence... The murder weapon, the stolen money, a confession. Anything. And Faureins has only researched the Chevreau lead. He hasn't explored any other theories. You are right to doubt. But I'm sure you will make the right decision. -Good day, ma'am. -Good day. -Here are the items you requested. -Thank you... You will be pleased to know the judge has allowed you to see your children. Thank you. Right... We are going to fight this, but this is not an easy case. Though, you have to admit, you have not done much to help matters... Forgive me... that's not what I meant. -I simply-- -Leave, please. No, you misunderstood me... Get out! Very well... -Good afternoon, ladies. -Afternoon. Can I help you? Is your wife around? No. Where is she? In prison... Haven't you read the papers? No, I didn't know. Can I take a message? No, that won't be necessary. I'm sick of you... Éric? What is it, son? Come on, let's go. Éric, what's wrong? Tell me. All my classmates are saying Mom killed someone. They called her a whore. What people are saying about your mother isn't true. We have to be strong. Come in. Thank you. Please, have a seat. So... "Mrs. Colette Chevreau, "born Colette Mercier May 8th 1936 in Roubaix, France. "You have been charged with violent theft, "willful destruction of an automobile "and felony murder on the person of Antoine Bonnefond, "banker of Desmets Bank in Saint-Léonard." In my report, I have also stated you have refused the right to an attorney. Do you have anything to declare? No. Except to say that none of this makes any sense. Would you mind taking a look at these, please? Can you confirm these are drawings of you? No. I mean... It can't be me, I have a scar here after undergoing two cesareans... It is possible, Mrs. Chevreau, Mr. Bonnefond may have chosen to omit that detail. Next... "A woman named Mireille Degroz, "housewife, living at 4 chemin de la Guerche in Saint-Léonard. "She confirms she saw you on November 12th around 5 p.m. "in the company of Antoine Bonnefond, in his car, "a Citroen, license plate number 234 BA 59, "heading toward the hamlet of Bois de la Cambre." Can you confirm this? I'm sorry. No... No. I was not with Mr. Bonnefond at that time, because I was... You were? I was in Arras. That is indeed what you said in your statement. However, this contradicts the testimony of Robert Ferrand, as well as that of his wife. Officers! We will proceed tomorrow morning, ma'am. Have your head or tummy been hurting recently? No? Deep breath, please. Well, I can't see anything wrong. What is it, sweetheart? I want my Mommy... -How much I do owe you? -No, please. No charge. Oh. Thank you. Do you know her well? Excuse me? Colette, my wife. You must know her since she gave me your number for the children. Yes. Don't believe what you read in the papers. No, of course not. Thank you. Good luck, sir. COLETTE THE DEVIL BEHIND BARS COLETTE THE DEVIL BEHIND BARS I wish to discuss the testimonies of Jean-Marc and Didier Norsaint, apprentice bakers. They both declared participating in dinner parties they described as, and I quote, "sexual orgies," at your home, during the Winter of 1964. More nonsense... It is public knowledge that you have had several extra-marital affairs... Yes, I have had lovers. I sleep with other men because... Because I can no longer make love to my husband. For what reason? Because I no longer feel any pleasure. We stopped making love over five years ago, after Christophe was born. Pierre is aware of my affairs, but we agreed never to speak of them. But I love my family, I love my children, and I love our life together. Pierre is my husband, and I love him. Let us move on to the motive. What are your means of subsistence? We live on the inheritance my father left me eight years ago. A very generous inheritance that helps me provide for my family. Excuse me? I inherited an enormous sum of money that allowed me to pay for our apartment, my car, and the shop, and live a good life. I already explained this to Commissioner Faureins. Yes, of course. Yes. I will call you back later. What's wrong? The financial motive doesn't add up. Mrs. Chevreau's notary confirmed it. Why did Faureins neglect to tell me she had money? The accusations against her are based on rumors and one testimony. "Colette, the devil." Fine, she has affairs. Does that make her a criminal? Well I... Wait... The truth is that Sélignac and Faureins wanted me to charge her. I know it. It is more convenient to have a defendant like her. And I let them. Yes? Anne-Marie Leroux, examining magistrate. I am in charge of the Bonnefond murder. Leave me be, I'm sick. Ma'am... Go play somewhere else. In your statement, you said... "I immediately recognized the banker's car. "Colette Chevreau, the photographer's wife, "was sitting next to him. They drove past just before 5 p.m." Yeah... Your statement says you are certain. Yes... You recognized two people speeding by in a car at nightfall? Yeah... Where were you? Over there, at the window. So, through this window, at nightfall, you were able to recognize two people and the vehicle even though it was driving at high speed? Why did you tell the commissioner that? I told him because... Why? Because the inspector told me to. He said if I didn't, they would take my children away. Mrs. Degroz, perjury is punishable by up to a year in prison. But there is still time to tell the truth. -Good day. -Good day. I would like to speak to Jean-Marc and Didier Norsaint, please. Who are you? Anne-Marie Leroux, examining magistrate. Boys! What? Gentlemen. I'm investigating the murder of Antoine Bonnefond. You told Commissioner Faureins that you, and I quote, "Participated in several orgies with Colette Chevreau at her home." Is that correct? Oh my goodness! -Yeah, that's right. -Yeah. Good. Can you tell me on what part of her body Mrs. Chevreau has a scar? A scar? Did you see a scar? Nah, I didn't. I don't know... her knee? Yeah, that's right. But it was dark... Right, yeah... It was dark. But I think it was her knee... Thank you. Wasn't it on her elbow? You stupid idiots! NATIONAL POLICE FORCE Excuse me... -Ma'am. -Good day. I wish to speak to Lieutenant Ferrand. I'm afraid the lieutenant has moved. Moved? When? Last week. He has gone to live near Angoulême... Then could I have his address, please? Sorry, I can't give you that information. His address, please. My apologies. Be back in a minute. Excuse me, I will be right back. What is going on? Why are you questioning all the witnesses again? Commissioner Faureins encouraged several false testimonies, including the one that formerly accuses Mrs. Chevreau. He also truncated the defendant's statement. As such, the case has fallen apart. So? You are the one who charged Chevreau, no? So what are you going to do now? Admitting you made a mistake on your first ever case will only damage your reputation. Your funeral! -Hello? -Ms. Leroux? Speaking. Meet me in the park in an hour. Who is this? I have something important to tell you. I will be there, but... Thank you. Ms. Leroux? Dr. Bernard Lefèvre. I'm the one who telephoned. Would you mind if we... Yes, of course. For the past few years, Colette Chevreau and I have been working together. Colette is a... go-between. When she hears about a woman wishing to terminate a pregnancy, she puts them in touch with me. I'm a doctor, I perform abortions. The day of the murder, she was in Arras with me in my office, with a pregnant sixteen-year-old girl. She didn't tell you because she was protecting us. Because she is fully aware of what we all risk if she told the truth. I... I care about Colette very much. Now, of course, you have a motive to charge her. And myself. And all the women who have had abortions. But I had no choice. I can't let her become a victim of injustice. So I thought, perhaps... rather naively, that because you are young, and a woman, that I might hope for a miracle. Now you have the truth. I am at your disposal. Good day. Dear viewers, I must speak up while I still have the right. Up until Monday night, I was a feudal lord of Cotentin, a married man. But now, our reign is over. A new law has come into effect. A law that reforms matrimonial law. A law that gives women a number of new rights. With the establishment of this law, they wish to determine, if woman is indeed equal to man. Good day, ma'am. I would like to open a bank account. I will need a form of identification and your husband's written permission if you are a married woman. This authorization will no longer be necessary. Thanks to this new matrimonial regime, wives will be able to open their own account without the need for their husband's permission. Ah, Your Honor. We just received the results from the new coroner. Thank you. Well? -I was right. -Excellent! Can the justice system fully place its trust in science? New evidence in a surprise twist at Saint-Léonard leads to doubt. Experts are now locking horns around the body of the banker following the exhumation requested by examining magistrate Leroux. If the latest examination contradicts the previous results, it could prove the innocence of the accused, Colette Chevreau, who has been incarcerated for over ten days now... What the hell is this? You are removing me from the case? Have a seat. I haven't got time for this! Following the results found by the new coroner, establishing the time of death at 6:30 p.m., I have handed this case over to the Paris police force. They are already on site at Saint-Léonard. I only wish I had got Inspector Berthelot to confess. I know you told him to put pressure on Mireille Degroz to give a false testimony. You may go. Ms. Leroux? If you weren't your father's daughter, I would have you removed from this case too. I do not have to justify my decisions. I am the examining magistrate. "The most powerful man in France," Napoleon Bonaparte. Well done, my girl! I am so proud of you. So am I, darling! Thank you, Mother. A toast... to our daughter. Our talented, successful daughter. To you, darling. Well done! Good day, Mrs. Chevreau. I offer you a formal apology on behalf of the justice system. And myself. I know what you were doing in Arras. But I shall not be pursuing the matter. DETENTION CENTER Mommy! Hello, darling! Hello, my little ones. A FEW DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF COLETTE CHEVREAU, BONNEFOND'S TRUE KILLER WAS ARRESTED AND SENTENCED TO 20 YEARS.
