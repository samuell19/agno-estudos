Wait! Wait! What did I tell you, Hitomi? You can't climb over the barrier, don't you ever listen? - Chizuru is better. - Nice job. You're a naughty kid. So naughty. Told you to bring the money here. - Yes. - You're going on beat? Yes, I'm about to. - Thanks for your effort. - Don't mention it. Finally you've appeared. I thought you've gone missing. What's wrong? Are you hiding something from me? Oh you're still here? But we've closed now, could you leave? My leg! It hurts! Don't shoot. THE BEAST TO DIE (The Last Shooter, T.M.) Good morning, this is the 6 a.m. news. Three days ago, Detective Okada of the Police Department was murdered. The culprit snatched the detective 's gun, and killed three triad members in an underground casino. Even though the police have teamed up thousands of investigators, they've been searching in motels, hotels in the area, but there's still no new clue. The person who left his fingerprints on the detective is still at large. The investigation hasn't been successful. The police will expand their search area, and they'll request the nearby counties and their police to assist. Welcome. Are you here to open a new account? Yes. You need an ATM card? Yes. Sure, please wait. - Thanks. - Welcome. Sure, thanks. Thanks. Please wait. It's time, lower the iron gate. Good job. Good job. Good job. That must be Mr. Kawamura from the head office? I guess so. I was right. Thanks. The sun rises from the steep cliffs, Sorrow creeps past below the overpass. The place afar. Railway barriers one after the other... there the image of a lonely figure... You're a wanderer. You came from the past, surpassed the future. Looking for the sense of homesickness that's been long gone. In such a rush, walking by in sorrow, as in a poem of time. Like killing a snake with a stone. Breaking off a reincarnation, without the will to conquer loneliness, more lonely than the demon. Can you stand the long, cold winter? You didn't believe in anything. What you believe in is rage. Not certain that whether you've ever denied lust, to impeach your so-called lust. The tiresome sorrow that you get when you don't. Hugging and kissing someone gently, not going home. You didn't love anything, you're a lonely man. The sorrow in the sunset reached the slope, drifting there, with no purpose. When can you go home? But there's no home for you. When can you go home? But there's no home for you. Hello, Ginza Jewelry. Do you do out-of-shop sales? Yes, we do. I'd like to get a diamond ring. Could you select a few in the mi//ions range? Sure. Then, tomorrow, Friday, at two fifty, could I meet you at Toyo Bank's Nihonbashi branch? If I like them, I'll pay you in cash then. Certainly. My name is Nagatomo. Mr. Nagatomo, right? In order to recognise you... how about you wearing a pair of sun glasses? Alright. Welcome. Could you transfer me to Miss lshijima at the counter please? Hold on please. Sorry for the wait, this is lshijima of the loans department. Pay attention to what I'm about to say. There's a man in sun glasses and white suit in front of you, and he's got a pistol in his front pocket. And five bombs in his suitcase. You'll be fine if you don't make a scene, understand? Understand. We just want money, how much do you have now? I guess around two million. Good, call that man to the counter, and hand him the money. Make the announcement, "Call for Mr. Nagatomo of Ginza Jewelry." Do it. Got it? Mr. Nagatomo of Ginza Jewelry, there's a call for you. Manager, could you come here and confirm the cheque please? There's a pistol in his front pocket. That is a bomb! Take cover! Leave! Run everyone! Call the police! Hurry! What are you doing? This afternoon at two fifty, there's an attempted robbery at the Toyo Bank's Nihonbashi branch. After the initial investigation, the "suspect" Mr. Nagatomo, who works at Ginza Jewelry, is supposed to meet a client there, and he wasn't armed with any pistol or bomb. The police would focus on anyone who might have a grudge with Mr. Nagatomo or the Toyo Bank, and they'll fol/ow up the investigation. The Toyo Bank's Nihonbashi branch has transactions with the nearby two department stores and other large shops. At the time of the incident, it's shortly after when the cash has reached the bank, a total of around four billion yen. It was a very critical moment. And now, over to the next piece of news. The US Government's mid-term review, the initial agreement... I was surprised to see you outside the concert hall. Hello. Lately, there's a lot of audience who can't appreciate music. - You work nearby? - N0, in Nihonbashi. It's a foreign firm called U.S. Works. The company president wants t0 hear this, that's why I'm here. This is good. You and the company president share the same interest, that's great. But he's over sixty! What about you? Oh, I've been trying to find the "Funeral March". I'm off then, bye. Bye. - And... - Yes? Will you go to the next concert at Hibiya? I guess so. - See you. - See you. I've never been good at tailing people. I don't plan to interfere in what you're doing, but I'm here to tell you. I'm Detective Kashiwagi of the police department. If you want to listen to it, you can sit down. Thanks. Aren't you going to sit down? Thanks. Why did you follow me? It's a long story. The truth is, one of our detectives got killed about two weeks ago. His gun was stolen; Four hours later, the same gun was used to kill three yakuza members. But we still can't find the suspect. Around the time of the crimes, we've been given certain information. Height: above 180cm, broad shoulders, walks like the dead. The way he walks, has made a strong impression. But the information has been put aside after the meeting, I'm the only one who cares among 150 detectives. You don't seem to be listening. Iam. Then why are you taking this so seriously? Because no one else is. I'm not interested in a case which has everyone's attention. It's just the way I am, I can't do anything about it. What does your intuition tell you? That's... Hey, sorry... I'm the organiser yet I'm late, so sorry. Look who I've brought along. Date? It's been a while. It's been a while, I heard that you're no longer a foreign correspondent. The Indian civil war pictures that you sent in were really amazing. You must feel terrible being kicked out from the war scene. Right. What do you do now? He's working in translations at my publishing company. You're working? I could see what I could do if you want. Academic qualifications don't matter, I could set you up for the post of PR Executive. Date, when you were in university, you loved to hang out in the library, or listen to classical and drink tea. Yes, he finished Nietzsche's works in 6 months. And he has read everything by Chandler and Hammett. He's never been much of a talker, and he's a bit of a weirdo. I practically dragged him here. Right, you were in the rifle club. Do you still shoot? Once in a while. Really? But I guess in Japan, all you can shoot are little birds or rabbits. Alright... even Date could join us, let's begin. Come on... organiser. We're approaching thirty next year, this is the last get together in our 20s. Farewell, youth. Come on, everyone. Are you leaving the country soon? The Foreign Affairs Department is full of talent. Just going round in the same circle. Tojo. Are you involved in Foreign Exchange and Trade Laws anti-demonstrations? That just concerns the airplanes sector. My department, the Steel Department is fine. Yuki, your company stocks are losing. We plan to do something about that next week. We did relatively well today before the market closed. Must be the politicians! I guess. Careful, you! I think it's your fault, Mister. What was that? You've been really rude since the beginning. - What? - Calm down. I'm turning 30 next year, we're the same age, though I didn't go to college, but I worked hard too, during the 70s. Come on! Stay cool. - What? - What? Tojo! Why are you fighting with the waiter? Sit down. The service of this place has gone down. The waiters were of better standard before. It's a time filled with third grade humanity, let's just deal with it. You can't avoid it. Mister. You should be careful of what you say. You're really annoying. What's that? Get the manager here. I'm really sorry. Come on, Tojo. Eat up. What are you looking at? You have a problem? What do you want? Assholes. Tojo... come on, buddy! Tojo! You alright? Call the ambulance! Tojo! What? Why are you sitting here? What are you doing here? What's the matter? Why aren't you drinking? I can't drink. Really? I'm surprised. What's wrong with your eyes? Seems like there's no life in them. Yours too. Because of a woman? She said she wanted to go to U.S., some "Japanese Flamenco," she wants to become a dancer there all of a sudden. To be honest, I don't get it. D0 you play guitar? You have good fingers. You can tell? But this is the only thing that could stand up now. That's why I worked at that restaurant. That woman said I should let her go to the branch at L.A., but that guy... he's so mean, I got pissed off. The woman gave me this bar, though it's in the red every month. The girl just now? She's gone for a ride with a young colonel, a ride for the entire night. This is the first time I act like this. You don't seem like a fool who would fall in love. Who are you talking about? Who's in love? I'll kill you. I'll go take care of her. You didn't do it. I saw the look in her eyes when I tried to choke her. I doubt it. Did she say something? Yes. "Forgive me, darling." She called me darling. I chicken out every time, it's always the same. Isn't your world a bit too small? What do you mean? The stuff you ordered, A fully automatic handgun with silencer, fifty bullets. I'm off. Excuse me. I'd like to test this silencer out. Try it out any way you want, I'm not sure which gang you belong to, but I think you could call yourself a pro. Two department stores would send their cash income before two and the money will reach the vault before two forty five. Then the Cashiers Department will confirm the amount, there should be a total of around four billion, just the ten thousand notes should worth about two billion, that's our share. When do we do it? Ffiday. I've booked a cottage in lzu, I hope you can master the use of a gun. When? Tomorrow, bring your woman along. Walk to the subway with me. I think I've been stalked by a strange person lately, he might be a detective. But I don't seeing anyone. Taxi. Alright then, good night. Mr. Date. Drive on. The sun rises from the steep cliffs, Sorrow creeps past below the overpass. The place afar. Railway barriers one after the other... there the image of a lonely figure... You're a wanderer. You came from the past, surpassed the future. Looking for the sense of homesickness that's been long gone. In such a rush, walking by in sorrow, as in a poem of time. Like killing a snake with a stone. Breaking off a reincarnation, without the will to conquer loneliness, more lonely than the demon. Can you stand the long, cold winter? You didn't believe in anything. What you believe in is rage. Not certain that whether you've ever denied lust, to impeach your so-called lust. The tiresome sorrow that you get when you don't. Hugging and kissing someone gently, not going home. You didn't love anything, you're a lonely man. The sorrow in the sunset reached the slope, drifting there, with no purpose. When can you go home? But there's no home for you. I think you've got the grasp of it. I'm not so sure at the scene. Because they are moving targets. This is not easy. Don't you have a good target? That's why I told you to bring your woman, Set it? Finally, you can take care of it once and for all. When can you go home? I'm full. Does it taste awful? Not at all. It's really good. Nothing could be better. The last supper, right. Maybe I put too much salt, sorry. Where are you off to? To get some air, you two enjoy the dinner. - I'm off. - See you. I guess he wants to leave us alone. Let's go to U.S., I'm sure we can make some money. God hasn't forsaken us. The woman is dead. She's turned into a pile of soil, isn't this wonderful? Scared? I don't blame you. It doesn't matter. Really. It's not because you've killed a person, but because you realise you're thrilled about the kill. You must feel puzzled, right? No worries. It was the same with me in the beginning, you will feel at ease sooner or later. Because at this point, you're absolutely perfect, even the demon can't deny this truth. I came, and now you are... The so-called reincarnation, the tiresome long history, they've all been turned down because of your one bullet. The bullet stops time. How wonderful is that? A beautiful demonic moment! As for returning to the present world built based on laws, it's something of the past to you. Do you understand? Don't sigh. This is good. You're now my partner. What you're about to do will be the beginning of a new turn in history, and it hints that you will have a bright start. You're really beautiful now, God is nothing compared to you. You've surpassed the level of gods. And now, you've finally found your true self. The blood of the beast which has been denied by history, is beginning to boil. Do you understand? You have nothing to fear now, charge ahead! Team up with me! Come on! Charge ahead! Sanada. What's wrong? What are you afraid of? Pick it up. Pick up the demon's pistol! Good work. - Thanks. Please come again. - Thanks. - How can I help you? - Welcome. What's going on? I'll look into it right away. It's still early, call the duty office. Call the duty office. Raise your hands! You, hands up! Get up! Hands in the air. Stand together, hurry! What are you doing? Hurry! Come on! Stand in a group. Over there. Stand together, hands up in the air. Don't move. What are you doing? What are you looking at? Alright, stand together, hands in the air. Stand still, don't move. Stand up, hurry. Hurry UP! Stand up, hands in the air. Come on! Faster! Faster! Could you step closer? Hurry UP- What is it? Just come closer. Hurry up! Come on. Speed up! Stand together, hands in the air. What are you doing? What are you looking at? Hurry and put the money in the bag. Do as he says, quick! Freeze. Don't move or I'll kill you! Stay here... for five minutes. Be good, understand? Don't move for five minutes. Mr. Date. First take the Ginza Line for Kanda, then change to Yamanote Line and get off at Tokyo Station. And then directly to Atami. Yes, and from Atami, we rent a car to the villa in lzu. I've bumped into you twice, this doesn't feel right. This is fate. You're heading to Kanda? Yes. Heading to the publisher's to discuss about my translations. I'm heading there also. A student got killed by thugs in a restaurant in Kanda. What kind of a world is this? Lately you don't seem to be home a lot. I've been going away on trips. Today too? After the meeting. Where to? North east direction. This is Kanda Station, passengers needing to transfer please get off. Something's up? The bank's been robbed. Where, when? Thirty minutes ago, the Toyo Bank in Nihonbashi. Thirty people were held hostage, they robbed a lot of money. Attention all units, one of the two suspects who got away is above 180cm, wearing a light brown jacket, he's carrying a brown handbag and wears a mask. The other suspect wears an U. S. Army jacket. Alright, got it. Thanks. Good evening, all passengers. This train will depart at 19:08. The Hakkoda of the NE Line heading to Aomori. The train will stop at the following stations... Oomiya, Ooyama, lshibashi, Shirakawa... Thank you for choosing to travel with us. Excuse me, ticket please. OK, thanks. Thanks. Excuse me, ticket please. A ticket costs 3,000 yen, unbelievable. Just the ticket is 3,900 yen, an extra 900 for the express, do you think these are expenses? It's a tough question. Will I be able to claim my expenses? Or I'll be severely warned and punished? You're the key! You've a big role in it. I've put aside the murder case in the restaurant, and I haven't contacted HQ. I don't think there's another detective who is as stupid as me. Newsflash. Latest update on the Toyo Bank's Nihonbashi branch robbery. The rented car by the suspects has just been found. It's parked in the car park nearby the Toyo Bank. The police conclude that the suspects used other transportation, they took one of the subway lines passing through Nihonbashi. And the police have stepped up the organisation of the search party. But then, it's necessary for a stupid detective like me to be around. Right, why did you get fired by the newspaper office? I guess you've found out already. Yes. Angola, Lebanon, India, and Uganda up to last year. You have gone to all the battlefields. I've been to the newspaper office and have seen your pictures. Really tragic. Especially two, three years back. Those are more gruesome than any autopsy photograph I've seen. The soldiers and civilians who got slashed, those torn up faces and internal organs, all the pictures are of the type. Japanese journalism is very conservative, it's wrong to show those pictures. Your company fired you before they took a second look, you can't blame them. But why did you only take those type of pictures? And now, the /ate news. This afternoon at three, the Toyo Bank's Nihonbashi branch got robbed, and there's still no sign of the suspects' whereabouts. The police found out that only one victim was shot after the robbery, and they have focused a lot on this. This young woman worked as a company president's secretary at U. S. Works, her name is Hanada Reiko, 23 years old. It's really questionable why the suspects killed Miss Hanada only among the hostages. I've made up my mind! I'd do this without a search warrant. She was a good girl. Freeze. What's this? This is the U.S. Army uniform I wore in India. You'll leave at the next stop. Don't be silly. Where's your partner? Where are you supposed to meet up? I don't know what you're talking about. It's really strange. I'm getting more interested in revealing your crimes. Why? Because of your look, you've been luring me to catch you. Thanks. It's almost midnight. The light will be dimmed, please enjoy your sleep. Do you want to sleep now? Let me tell you a bedtime story. A story about Rip Van Winkle... isn't that some name? Rip Van Winkle... What a good name! He went hunting in the mountains. Hunting. And then, he met a dwarf. But I forgot the name of the dwarf, coz it's a long time ago. Anyway, he met a dwarf, Winkle... was invited to drink. That type of wine is really too tasty, and he got drunk, then he had a dream, fell deep into sleep, had a dream. Are you cold? Are you cold? That dream, any hunter would love to dream about, as the dream was about to reach climax, he woke up at that time, he looked around, the dwarf has gone, the forest looks different. Winkle was eager to see his wife, so he rushed back to the village. Who would have thought? That his wife has died, the whole village has changed. You know? D0 you understand what I said? It meant, during the time Winkle was sleeping, it's been decades. Interesting, isn't it? I thought you don't have a wife. I'm not telling my story, I'm telling Rip Van's story. Rip Van Winkle... He took the wine from the dwarf. Ifl could, I'd like to have a taste of that wine. I remember now, Rum Cointreau, add a bit of lemon juice, shake it. You know? X...Y...Z Right. This is called "the last of the wines". You're really lucky. You want to sleep now? Interesting, isn't it? I'm tired. Let's go to sleep. War. The war is about to begin. Mister. Are you alright, mister? Stop. Stop. We... Stop. Let's run! We've got the money. OK... I know... calm down... Calm down, can you hear me? Calm down. Deep breath. Great, stay calm. OK, retreat. Retreat. Come on, we have to run! Where should we go? Up to you, wherever. Hand me the money. Sure. Hand it over. Yes. Ready? Listen up. You're a good soldier, got it? You're a good soldier. Don't panic, no matter what happens. Do as you wish from now on. Got it? Kill them! Go! Who are you? Asshole. What are you looking at? Kill them! Good! Kill them! Don't move! Don't move! Stay still! D0 you hear me? Don't move! Stay still! D0 you hear me? Don't move! That's right! D0 her! D0 her! Just like that time... you know. Do her! Do her! Come on, it's just the same, I was all alone then. I was alone, you know? There's one soldier who fell. He's a mercenary, I'm not even sure of his nationality. He's a mercenary. It was about ten miles south of Beirut, you know? I remember now. Do her! Come on! Good. He was hit three times in the belly. You know? He shot morphine up himself. A morphine shot, you know why? Three bullets. You know? I went crazy and kept taking pictures. I went nuts! I was high. I was excited. I was so high. And suddenly, a guerilla showed up, the only alive guerilla. At the time, I got higher, and higher, he shot his leg, you know? Can you tell how excited I was? Listen up, he had a Russia made pistol, and walked closer to me, you know? Suddenly, I was scared. I would get shot for sure. I panic. With the mercenary's gun in my hand, I told that guy to stay back, "l'm a reporter, a Japanese, I had nothing to do with it." But he kept getting closer. And me... due to fear, I fired. Help. I remember I had a sudden rush. I killed someone. For the following three days and nights, I wandered around the jungle pointlessly, for what? And why? I was trying to find the next target, all I could think of was to kill. You know? Can you understand? That's ecstasy. I realised that I've surpassed god, I was ecstatic. At the end of the jungle, I found a target. Another guerilla, he was raping an underage girl, he was raping her. I said, "Stop!" Stop! Stop! Stop! Let go of the girl! Let her go! What? What're you trying to do? Go to hell!
