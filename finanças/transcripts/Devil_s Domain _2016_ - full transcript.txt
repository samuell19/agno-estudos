You have to guess. Do it again. Feels like you're writing "z-z-z-z-z". I wrote your name. 'Cause you're my best friend. What are you doing? I... I thought that... There you go. What the hell is she doing in there? Same thing she does every day. Lisa! Hurry up, we're gonna be late! Just a minute. I'll drive her. You go ahead. - You sure? - Yeah. Thank you. Hon, bill's gonna take you, all right? - Wait! - I can't wait! Bye! I'll see you, hon. Come on, honey, I'll take you. Looks like we're rolling. You know, I can walk. Don't be crazy. Come on. I'll drive you. I thought you quit? You know, we could have that thing surgically connected to the side of your head. Will be a lot easier without evoking carpel tunnel syndrome. You can get some screws and we'll just put 'em in your skull. I have a drill in the back. I'm just joking. I sure liked things a lot better when we were friends. The good old days. There's your, uh, your little gal pal. She's still being an ass? Yeah, she's... God! Whatever. You know... You can talk to me about anything. You got something on your mind you wanna talk about, you can share it with me, you know. It's not a big deal. Anyway, um... Call me if you need a ride home. All right? Okay. Here she comes. Hey, loser. Ew! So you've read the first two pages. Can anybody tell me the name of the black death? Anybody at all? Yep, just... Just raise that hand. Let me know. Anybody know it? It's in the book. You just read it. Scientific term, black death. Lisa, do you know the answer? I'm sorry, what? "I'm sorry, what?" "I'm sorry, what?" Is not the answer I was looking for. You know, Lisa, there was a time when at least it seemed like you cared about having a future. Now it just seems like you're a space cadet. Get with it, will you? Idiot. Lexi. Just because Lisa doesn't care abut learning, doesn't mean she's an idiot. That's called being stupid. Today it's best known as the black death, or the plague. Medieval people called it the sickness. The name "bubonic" comes from medieval Latin word... Bubo via Italian bilbo... meaning a pustule, growth, or swelling. Come on, guys. Did anyone do heir homework? Anybody? You made the right choice. Excuse me? What's going on? Help! Where am I? Help! Help! What's going on? Please! No! No! Help! No! Please! Please don't hurt me! This is what happens when you are not nice. Hi. How are you? Fat ass. Shemale. Ew! Can you not sit next to us when I'm trying to eat? She should really kill himself. She is a he. Did he, like, cut it off? Gross. Did you guys see that video of that chick getting killed? - No. - Play it. Ugh! I can't. It was on snapchat. Here. Is that Lexi? You couldn't tell it was she. Is Jake making more stupid videos? - Ugh! - He's such a dweeb. Where the hell do you think you're going? To the bathroom? That's the men's room. See that sign? You can't go in there! Why not? You little bitch. I should clack you out, you damn shemale. Go on. Hit me. Yeah. Hit me. Attack someone for no reason other than you're afraid and insecure of me expressing myself. Hey! What's going on here, boys? John, stop being a bully. Okay? Brenden can use any bathroom he wants. And you get to class. Whatever thanks. Hey, Lisa. Lisa, check this out. Yeah, that's it. Time's up. Hmm? Mm-mm? Isn't that the best thing ever? It's the stupidest thing ever. Ah, I saw a smile. A small one. Hey, I found this crazy b zombie movie from, like, the '90s. Wanna watch tonight? It's so bad it's good. I don't know if I feel like watching a movie tonight. Huh? Want a chip? - I'm good. I'm good. - Hmm? I thought bulimics first eat and then throw up. Or are we dabbling with anorexia here, too? You're such a dick. I'm just kidding. I'm coming over tonight whether you like it or not. Cookies and cream milkshake from trails. I know you want some. Hey... So since when did you want to start hanging out with me again? When did I stop hanging out with you? Oh, yeah? Well, how about every day since... Never mind. Regardless of what happened, we're still friends, right? - Yeah. - Hey, I bought this for you. Drink it. Mm! Mm-hmm? You know you love it. - It is the best shake ever. - Right? Hey, check this. Oh, god! Seriously, Andrew? Crazy, right? Andrew, what are you doing here? I thought you were too cool to hang out with me anymore, Mr. popular. Why would you wanna hang out with such a loser like me? "Loser Lisa" right? That's what you guys all call me. - I tell them... - You and your friends? - I tell them they're mean. - Yeah, right. I do. Everyday, I go, "you're mean." She's not a loser, she's just Lisa, Lisa normal. All right. Well, I gotta take a piss. Tmi. Uh, no. You needed to know that. That was a great piss. You know? Came out real smooth. Did you just come here to annoy me or what? I'm just teasing. Chill. What are you doing over there? I'm just tying my shoes. Or do you have a problem with that, too? Could you please just leave? All right. See you later, homie. I'm leaving. Love you. - Oh, my god. Did you do it? - Gotcha. Ew! What does she see in him? I can't wait to see this video. My mom's calling me. I'll see you inside. Hey, mom. Oh, my god, this is gonna be epic. You know, um... This isn't a costume party. Like, duh? What? What do you want, freak? Oh, my god! Oh, my god! It's all over her face. This is the grossest thing I've seen in my entire life. This is so gross. Oh, god. I'm gonna throw up. I actually feel bad for her. I don't, and you shouldn't either. Kill yourself. Oh, my god. I hate her so much. Oh, no! She is not. She is, she is. She is! Oh, my god! What a nasty dyke! Ew! Puke! Oh, my god! This is priceless. Do you know she wishes it was you doing that to her. No thanks. Oh, my god. I cannot wait for the entire school to see this. She's totally gonna kill herself. Well, yeah, maybe this wasn't the best idea. Are you kidding? This is gold. Yeah, if we posted this, she might, like, kill herself for real. So? She should kill herself. Yeah. I don't know. What is there to think about? She humiliated you. Am I right or am I right? I know I'm right. So can you like edit this all together? Like a highlight reel? We can start with her binging, then cut to her puking, and then we can cut to her shoving the dildo in. Add some funny music, too. This is the meanest joke. Why're we doing this? Don't pussy out on me now. I just, I don't wanna get in trouble. This was your idea. - Yeah, but... - She humiliated Rhonda. She told everyone that Rhonda was a dyke. And now she needs to pay. Oh, my god. I cannot wait for the whole school to see this. Uh-oh. What's up? What's up? I didn't think she'd show. Girl, I know you put down a bag of chips... down. Give it to me, baby. Give it to me. Come on. Give it to me, baby. Oh, my god. No, no, no, no. My room's open if you need somewhere to hide from all this. We can talk. Did you see her face? What's up with you? Oh, fuck my life. Honey, honey. Wait, wait, wait... Now what's wrong? What happened? Let me see that. Come on. Let me see that. That's on the Internet? All right. Oh, no! That's... That's cruel. Who would do something like that? I swear to god, you kids... You take cruelty to a whole another level. When I was your age, they didn't have the Internet. Didn't have cell phones, you couldn't send things to each other. Who would do that to you? You can call the police on these people. Gross. Can I help you? I know you're in there. Can you open the door, please? Lisa, I know what happened. I... I don't even know what to say. Look, I need to talk to you. Would you please unlock this door? Just go away. Mom! Do you have any idea how many phone calls I just got? How long has this been going on? Please don't! Please what? I saw the video, Lisa. So you're gay now? What is this, just another one of your phases? It's just a phase. Everything is just a phase, mom. What on earth did I ever do to make you act like this? And for god's sake, why would you film it and put it online for the entire world to see? You think I did this? - You didn't? - No. Then who did? Tell me, Lisa. Andrew. Andrew? Andrew, next door Andrew? I thought he was your friend. Oh, my god. I'm gonna kill him! Mom, wait, please. Good thing about a broken lock... You can't lock me out. Could you just please go away? You know something? You get away with a lot of stuff 'cause you're young. Making up your mind about what you wanna do. That's okay. But you gotta get a handle on this bulimia business. People die from that. Nice talk. You know, sooner or later you gotta trust somebody. Might as well start with me. I'm the step-father and all that, I get it. You don't trust anybody. Everybody's always trying to bring you down. Sooner or later, everyone's gonna get their comeuppance. Trust me. I spoke to the Dean of the school and I got them all suspended. Good. Andrew's mother apologized, said she felt terrible about what happened. Said she's gonna ground him for a month, take away his car and his video games. Would you excuse us for a minute? Okay. Lisa, I'm gonna get you the help that you need, okay? I wish dad was here. Well, he's not. So, um... Tomorrow morning we're gonna get you checked into a treatment facility, because I am not gonna stand by and watch while you hurt yourself. Do you understand me? What those girls did was wrong. And I can't even fathom the angst you're experiencing. If you need someone, I'm here for you. Your new friend, destiny. Hello, Lisa. Hi. It's okay. I'm right here with you. It's so good to see you smile. God, I hate them so much. Now what if I told you that that they'll be paying for what they did, and that we're going to kill them all? You're crazy. I have an idea. Why don't you come on over? Right now? Yes, silly. I wanna see you in person. Looking at you is turning me on too much. Shut up. Really. You have no clue how beautiful you are. You're not so bad yourself. So, what do you say? I say it's 1:00 in the morning. So what? I'll send you a car. Nothing bad is going to happen to you. I promise. Wait... how did you... Just get in. Hello, Lisa. Welcome to the dark side. There you go. Here. Have some wine. You're trying to get me wasted? No. Why would I wanna do such a thing like that? To your new friends. Who are you? Shh. I should probably head home. If my mom realizes I'm gone, she'll flip out. Don't worry about her. Actually from now on, you won't have to worry about anything or anyone. Wait. Um... There's something I have to talk to you about. What? This is going to sound really weird, but, like, just hear me out. I'm not who you think I am. Well, who are you then? I have many names, but... The one you're probably most familiar with is "Satan". - "Satan"? - Uh-huh. As in like "the devil"? What are you like, in one of those weird cult groups or something? Listen. Those people, they deserve to die. That's why I brought you here. I want us to kill them. You have to understand that I've been waiting for you a long time. From where? Hell? It has many names, but yes, you could say that. All right. Now you're really starting to freak me out. I sought you out to help you. Because there is something very important that I need from you. What? Let's just say it will enhance you. - "Enhance"? - Uh-huh. Okay. I, uh... I, um... Think I'm gonna get going. Let me prove it to you. Holy shit! Do you believe me now? Relax, relax. It's me. Oh, my god! - Oh, my god! - Shh. God is a very nice guy, but he has nothing to do with this. How did you do that? No, Lisa... I know I'm a total bitch, but I love you. Holy shit. You're... You really are the devil. You just became best friends with the most badass bitch in the universe. So, uh... How does that feel? It feels fucking insane. I can make all of your dreams come true. I know what you fantasize about. I can make you a star. But first, you have to help me so I can help you. What do you say? Are you asking me to sell my soul? Oh, no. I hate that phrase. What would you call it? A trade. Why me? Because you're special. Just think about what they did to you. I keep thinking about how guilty I'd feel for the rest of my life. That feeling, that's how I know you're the one. I don't know. This is... It's just really weird. Let's get even weirder. You'll be the most famous person in the world. What do you have to lose? My conscience. That's overrated. Check this out. She looks great. Oh, my god. She's so good. Oh, my god, it's Lisa. Hey, Lisa. Looking good. Congrats, Lisa. Congratulations. I'm so proud of you. That felt so real. It was real. The world is yours, Lisa. For your taking. Do we have a deal? Sure. What the hell. Now you can't go back on it, Lisa. Or else... Very bad things will happen. So what now? Now, the fun starts. Where are we going? You'll see. This is Kate's house. Don't be shy. What about her parents? Stop worrying. Hello, Kate? What if she wakes up? Let's see. Wake up! See? Hmm. You shouldn't have been such a bitch, Kate. Now you're goin to learn the real meaning of shame. Come on, shemale. It's not the pain that others can inflict. It's what the mind can do to itself that can hurt the most. Nobody ever said that a little help getting their own didn't hurt. Look. It's like true love. Here. Ready to call action? Come on. This would destroy her. Mm-hmm. Utterly and completely. Think about what she did to you. It would be pretty funny. But wait, if I post this, everyone will know it's me. I will post it. Listen, the only thing you have to do is push that little red button. Okay? That's it. Don't be afraid. To revenge. Oh, I'm so proud of you. Now what happens? Now I take you home. Wait, that's it? Yeah, for now. We'll take care of the rest of them later. What do you mean "take care of"? I said don't worry about it. I know you'll have a lot of questions pop into your mind. I want you to trust me. Just know that what we're doing is right. Get some sleep. And I'll see you sooner than you think. - Cheers. - Cheers. So hot. Did you hear that? Your folks back? No, they can't be. Okay. Who calls this late? Is it your ex again? Hello? Fuck! Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god. Oh... oh, god. Fuck! Oh, shit! They're gonna blame this on me. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck! Fuck, fuck. Oh, shit! What did I do? Jesus, Kelly, you're such a jerk. I really hate you. For Christ's sake, take off that stupid mask. You look retarded. Lisa? How are you feeling? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? Just checking. Uh, they're gonna be picking you up soon from the treatment facility. They say it's easier this way. It helps with... The adjusting period. Okay. I'm just gonna go and pack some clothes, then. I think this is for the best. Sure. Whatever. Are you sure you're okay? You seem different. I'm fine. Relax. So we're not allowed to visit her for 72 hours? That's correct. No family or friends allowed. Why are you guys looking at me like I'm crazy? Making sure you're gonna be all right. All right. Honey, you haven't even had any breakfast this morning. I'll eat if you want me to, mom. I won't puke it up if that's what you're worried about. I was just concerned that you would be hungry, that's all. All right. You must be Lisa. Yeah. Are you ready to come with us today? - I'm ready. - Good. - Bye, mom. - Okay. We will, um... We'll come and see you soon, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Bye, bill. Bye. What did I tell you? This calls for a celebration. How about instead of going to a rehab, we party like rockstars? Whoo! I'm okay with that. Ah! Whoo! Oh, my god. You're so bad. She totally believed us. Whoo! I got you a surprise. Being bad has its perks. You know what I think might help you? Get something out of your system? Hi, Lisa. Don't you want me? I've always wanted you. I don't know. Will you shut up and just feel good. There she is. Oh, you want shemale? Oh, she likes shemale! Oh, my god! That was an experience I don't think I'll ever forget any time soon. Oh, baby, we're just getting started. Did you see your handiwork? I mean, I wonder what's running through her brain. Let's take a look, shall we? Holy shit. What is she doing now? She's saying goodbye. No, no. I can't watch this. You must watch it! Don't you get it? This is all for you. All of this. Farewell, my dear. It's okay. She's in a better place now. Oh. You need to watch. These are the videos that I made. They're all for you. It's great. I love snapchat. One view and poof, it's all gone. Are those real? Of course they're real. I think I'm gonna to throw up in the sink. Oh, no, no, no, Lisa. We made a deal. No, she's dead. They're dead. That's real. I killed them! You killed them! They deserved to die. Besides, Kate, she did that to herself. Right? I need you to know that there are additional consequences. You need to watch this. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Yes. Sometimes bad things happen to good people. Two wrongs don't make a right. But three do. I feel sick. Oh, chill out. He died painlessly. Pain is like a concept that's been lost in this generation. Now, in the medieval times, they knew about pain. What was that? Let's take a look, shall we? Now back in the dark ages, they knew about pain. Do you want to give it a go? This is sadistic. Yes, it is. Come on. So, um, how is it going down there? You know Lisa, right? Help, please. Look at her! Help me! Are you sure you don't wanna give it a go? They say Jesus died for our sins. No! Well, so did you, my dear. I didn't ask for this. I don't want any of this. Oh, yes. Yes, you do. Remember? No, no. This is... This is cruel! Yes, it is. Okay. Relax. Let's go get some air outside, okay? It's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be good. Come on. Let's go. Come on. You know, Lisa, you can't think about life and death in such a black and white way. Death can be a beautiful thing and life can be much worse. I feel responsible. I killed them. The only thing you did was merely push a button on your phone. I would hardly call that killing someone. Right. I just love looking at cars go by. Come on. Have a seat. You see that girl... Walking in the distance? - Is that Rhonda? - It sure is. She's being distracted by her phone. She's not paying any attention. And bad things can happen when you don't pay any attention. What kind of bad things? She's gonna walk right into a street and get hit by a truck. That one's easy. You don't have to do anything. Rhonda, she... We've been friends since we're like six. Oh, friends? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. She hasn't been your friend in a really long time. In fact, quite the opposite. She's calling me. Oof! Don't pick up. Fuck that bitch. What's going on? Just don't pick up. She's gonna try and talk her way out of this. She loves me, doesn't she? No, no. There has to be another way. I'm afraid not. If you warn her, the deal is off. And as I told you, there will be repercussions. She doesn't deserve to die. Yes, she does. Think about the people she's going to embarrass. She can't even be honest with you. She can't be honest with anyone. Don't ruin my video, okay? That would not be cool. Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm going to hell for this, aren't I? Hell ain't so bad. I'm so proud of you. Just one more to go. I can't do this anymore. Where are you going? I should have saved her. Why? Because it wasthe right thing to do. - Wait, where are you going? - Just leave me alone. - Lisa thomson? - Yeah. Oh, my god. I can't believe it's really you. I'm sorry, do I know you? My friends are never gonna believe this. - Can we take a selfie? - Wait, what? I'm such a big fan. Honestly. You really changed my life. Okay. I just wanted to say thank you. Sure. Okay. Lisa! Oh, my gosh! You were so good! We are so proud of you. Yes, you were, everything you said. Really nice. Pretty impressed. What did I say? What? What do you mean? What did I say? Uh, you know, um, the TV interview that you just did where they said that you were the biggest reality star in television. I guess we're just the little people now. Excuse me. Honey! Honey, what's wrong? Please stop. Oh, my god. Holy shit. Lisa? These letters keep on coming. Look at this. Look at this. This little girl from Arkansas drew this. Look. It looks just like you. Oh, honey, I know it's a lot to deal with, but it's a good thing. Hey, we're still on to go house hunting next week, right? I can't wait to get out of this town... Seriously. Okay, kid. I'm sorry. Don't even think about that right now. Honey, you just relax. I know you've had a really hard day what is it? What's wrong? - I can't explain... - Oh, wait. Before I forget. Kzla has called, like, 10 times this morning. They wanna know if they can schedule an interview with you for Friday afternoon. And get this. They wanna interview me, too. - Who would've thought me on television? - Mon, mom, mom! Can you please just listen to me? Mom, what if I told you that none of this is real? This whole me being famous thing, it's all a fraud, it's all fake. What are you talking about, Lisa? What if I told you that the devil made all of this happen. The devil? We're being fooled. This is all not... This isn't real, mom. - Fooled? How am I being fooled, Lisa? - Mom, I'm not famous. I haven't done anything. For god's sake, I just left the house yesterday. Yesterday? Don't you remember, mom? You sent me to rehab. That was six months ago. Honey, it's may. Are you feeling okay? Sweetheart, I'm gonna get you some water, okay? I think you should sit down and relax. And I'm gonna call kzla and tell them that we'll get back to them as soon as you're feeling better, okay? Cookies and cream milkshake from trails. Just go away! That's so rude. After all I did for you. I made a mistake. You were a mess and now you have everything. How is that a mistake? Just one more. Okay? Just... just one. How does he die? He doesn't have to. I'm going to give you a child. What? Like we agreed upon. This will not only enhance you, but the world as well. No. You can keep your eyes closed if you want. We had a deal. You don't wanna go back on that. Just let it happen. Stop it! Who knows, you might even enjoy it. Besides, when did a little sex hurt anybody? It's actually quite good for you. If the child is born, what will it do to the world? Lisa, why would you ask such a thing? Tell me. Fine. We can do things the hard way if you want. I'm gonna need you to come with us. No! Whoo hoo! Hi, aunt Carol. I missed you. I missed you so much. Let's play a game. I think that will make things much easier for your small little brain. You are going to shoot her in the next 10 seconds. And if you don't, my friends here are gonna bash your head in. All right? So why don't you just allow me to do what I need to do and nobody needs to get hurt? No! I will not do it. I'm not gonna do it! Ten seconds! Nine seconds left. You used me! I'm the devil. What did you think I was gonna do? Lisa, what did you think was gonna happen? Eight seconds. Don't act like this is a bad thing. You're gonna be rich and famous. And in two weeks, you're gonna be on an island somewhere not even thinking about any of this, all right? All right? Seven seconds. Whoo! Bye, bill. Look what you did. Look at that. All right. You know what? Let's make this even easier for you. Let's not think about killing her. Let's think about putting her out of her misery. No, please! Stop! Stop what? Stop what? Stop it! Stop! Please, just stop! It won't be long before she bleeds out. You know what? Maybe this will inspire you more. Mom! Stop it. What's that, kiddo? I can't hear you. What's that? - What? - I'll do it. Don't do this... You wanna hear a secret? She doesn't care about you. In fact, she regrets having you. Sad but true. Very true. You must enjoy watching her suffer. You must enjoy... Three, two, one... Okay, okay, okay. I'll do what you want me to. Please just don't hurt anyone else. You know, Lisa, this can be pleasurable. Lisa! Lisa! Come on, back up. Lisa, how does it feel being a mother? Is it a boy or a girl? Lisa, what's the baby's name? It's all right.
