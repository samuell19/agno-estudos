You ain't nothing but trash, every one of ya! Filthy animals! You wop bastards are gonna die! You better get on the boat! You ain't nothing but trash! Dago bastards! Greasy wops! Guinea bastards, we don't need your kind! Wanna see you smacked down, boy! Damn wops! Send 'em all back where they belong! These Italians rarely acquire homes, always band together, do not acquire our language, and have neither respect for its government, or obedience to its laws. They are filthy in their persons and homes. They are without courage, honor, truth, pride, religion, or any quality that goes to make the good citizen. These Italian societies must perish. I intend to put an end to these infernal dago disturbances even if it proves necessary to wipe every one of them from the face of the earth. I was 15-years-old when my father brought us to America. New Orleans. In Sicily, there was famine. In America we were promised work. - You! Hey, dago! - Get over here! Papa... Come on, I want some big men over here! You! Hey, dago, get over here. Come on! Get in the wagon. Come on, you garlic eaters! You won't do no better than this. Come on boy, get up! You, come on, get up in the wagon. Come on, a strong man. You, get up here, yeah! Everything all right Mr. Macheca? Oh, everything is fine, Chief. - That was the only time - I ever saw David Hennessy, chief of police. And I saw Joseph Macheca, who ran the docks. But him, I would see again. Marchesi! Marchesi! Famiglia Marchesi! French market... French market. French market? French market. Bagnetto explained the dangerous situation to my father. The French market was run by the Mantrangas. But the Provenzanos, they worked the docks. He told us of a vendetta between them, but explained that this was never spoken of in Decatur Street. I buy vegetable. Uh-huh. You sell? Okay. On that same day, Chief Hennessy and Mayor Joe Shakspeare had been invited to a private luncheon at the home of biggest cotton exporter in New Orleans, James Houston. This whole dago thing is gettin' out of hand. There must be 30,000 filthy itais in New Orleans today. You can walk blocks without seeing a white face. He means to say, we're concerned about the future. They move here, live 10 to a room on Decatur Street, multiply like rabbits, and what do you get? You get disease, you get crime, and, we're afraid crime's gonna spread. We brought them here to replace the negroes after the emancipation. It's goin' on 30 years now, it ain't working like it was supposed to. Well, don't forget us micks. We slipped in after the niggers and before the dagos. We got a dago, Joseph "Macheeca," controls the docks. The gateway to the city, vital to our prosperity. The docks are well run. We have it on good authority that Mr. "Macheeca" is the head of... an Italian criminal organization, the Mafia? Uh-huh. They say he controls the Provenzano and Mantranga families. I know all about the Mafia, Mr. Parkerson. The Mafia's threatened my life on more than one occasion. Mr. Macheca is no part of the Mafia. We want you to shut him down. On what evidence? Evidence, Mr. Mayor? I see. Gentlemen, when you have evidence of Mr. Macheca's criminal activity, I will be happy to listen. Thank you, sir. Do you suppose "Macheeca" is payin' him off? We could pay him more. He's not gonna help. So, I say to your father, "Giovanni", "why do we keep living in Decatur Street?" "As long as we live there, people will think we're dagos." You know what he tells me? "Vincenzo..." "you got to know who you are, Vincenzo." Wait... pull this up. Javier, help them! Vincent Provenzano. Mr. Houston. Vincent, it seems to me, you're the man who make "Macheeca's" business work. Mr. Macheca works hard, Mr. Houston. You unload the fruit, "Macheeca" makes money. Mantranga sends his boys to buy the fruit from the warehouse, raise the price, sells it in the market. He makes money, what do you get? These your brothers? What do your brothers get? What are you trying to tell me, Mr. Houston? If I owned "Macheeca's" business, you know what I'd say to you? Make it more expensive for Mr. Mantranga. Make him pay a tax for the privilege of buying fruit. Then I'd say to you, "Vincent, keep that money," "you deserve it." It was nice talking to you, Mr. Houston. I've considered speaking with your brother, Giovanni, but I was told that you are the Provenzano with ambition, am I right? Yes, you're right. I'm considering buying "Macheeca's" business, but, I don't think he's gonna sell these docks, docks that run so well. And when I buy, I hope we can do business together. Business? Yeah, together. You want fruit, you pay for the privilege. I pay for fruit, not privilege. What, you stupid? Huh? You want fruit, you pay! All right, come on, who's next, huh? Go back to Sicily, you dumb potero! Come on! You want some? Come on! Had enough, huh? You want fruit, huh? You want it?! Let go of me! What's going on? Mr. Macheca, this boy, he tries to steal the fruit. And Tony stopped him. It's true, like uncle Vincenzo said, Papa. He's a thief, he's lying. I no thief. Get out of here. Get out of here! Tell your brothers and your son, I won't tolerate fighting. Now get these men back to work! No, no, no... Sure, I don't understand the words. See? Sorry? This one, wish, to go home with you. Thank you. Eh? He wish to know the name of signorina who take him. What happened to your eye? Vegetable, he's dangerous. Come along, Megan. We're late. Megan. Oh, Don Mantranga. Ah! Gaspare! This you boy? Gaspare, huh? You, uh, make a name for yourself, huh? Ah, the Provenzanos take advantage. You have guts to stand up to them. You want to do some work for me, huh? Mr. "Macheeca." Macheca. Forgive me, barging in. To what do I owe the pleasure, Mr. Houston? I'm thinking it must be such a drain on your energy, keeping an eye on all these shiftless dagos. Such a waste of your time. I appreciate your concern, Signore. Now, when I have labor problems that frustrate me, some mornings I wake up, I wanna sell the business, right there and then. Be done with it. I never think of selling my business, at any time of day. Don't be hasty. You might want to consider what I have to propose. What do you propose? A partnership, you and me. A partnership? You deal with the docks, I import the fruit. Take a whole load off your shoulders. In exchange for? Think of it, an Italian in business with me. Make this whole town sit up, take notice. Set an example. You'd make a name for yourself. Not just on the docks. Everywhere you go, people would say, "There goes Joseph Macheca." In exchange for? Naturally, I'd expect to turn a profit on my investment, say, 50 percent. Thank you for coming, Signore. It's good to know of your interest in shiftless dagos. Now, hold on. Oh, I intend to, with both hands. Don't do something you might regret, sir. Are you threatening me, Signore? Threatening you? Goddamn right. For Chrissake, listen to what I'm offering. I understand precisely what you offer. To strip me of my business for pennies, and to take it by force if I refuse. Please. Don't let me take any more of your valuable time. You know, you and I, don't get along. So it would appear. Which one you like? Uh... I like those ones. Don't you? Uh, si, yes. Those I choose if I am... signorina, which I no am. You make me laugh. Is good or is bad? It's good. I told you... I have a problem. Our people would like to shut down my docks. So I have to bring in Charles Mantranga to provide the workers. And this would make the Provenzanos unhappy. I can't afford trouble. Well, there won't be any. Us foreigners have to stick together. I ain't much of a gardener, but you said you'd buy 'em. Grazie, you grow me more? Nah, nah, I got me job digging a canal. It ain't too bad. I suppose I'll work there until some dago says he'll do it cheaper or I die of yellow fever. Or, I might head north, like every other nigger I know. Chicago. Oh, uh... Thanks, little man. My name... Gaspare. My name's Samuel. Samuel. At the docks! Mantranga needs us. Come! Stay out of it, Chief. You might get hurt. If there's any more trouble, I'll break both your legs and put you on a boat back to Sicily! Capice?! You still don't see a problem, Chief? Can't have the docks held hostage by dagos. The white race is already under attack by a veritable army of wogs. Perhaps there's someone who wants to disrupt those docks, Mr. Parkerson. That ever cross your mind? Someone who'd like to own those docks? We have got to keep public order. I want "Macheeca" arrested. On what charge? Trying to keep his business open?! Do you like dagos, Chief? Anything happens to Joseph Macheca, you'll be my first stop. As mayor, I ask you to uphold the law. If you can't... Or won't. I will find someone who will. Jesus, David, I appointed you. We're old friends. I know we are, Joe. That doesn't mean you can fire me. Metropolitan police answer to state of Louisiana, as you're well aware. You're an arrogant son-of-a-gun, ain't ya? Yes, I am. I've earned the right. I have a reputation as a lawman in this state that's unrivaled. There's not a soul in this city believes that David Hennessy is a guinea lover. Well, you've given me an idea. Perhaps I'll go after your job, Mr. Mayor. Good day, gentlemen. He's awful slow to get the point. He's Irish. He's popular, don't let us forget it. The man on the street thinks of Hennessy as a knight in shining armor. If he does get it into his head to run against me next year, I won't stand a Chinaman's chance. On the other hand, there's lot of folks who can't stand him. Hold on! Go on, tear him up, boy! Mr. Houston. You've done well, my son. It's a good beginning. Thank you, Mr. Houston. But, only a beginning. Are you in for the long haul? The stakes are very high. Most dogs will submit to the strongest dog. Roll over on their back, belly exposed. It's a gesture of surrender. These dogs, both, willing to put it to the test, they fight to the finish. It's amazing. Self confidence. Still, you have to teach them to kill. You follow me? I follow you. You gotta put your lips together like you're gonna kiss a girl. Blow. You want a ride? Get in here! Gaspare, you still fight? Fight? Put up your dukes. You're gonna be the next John L. Sullivan. Down, down, down! Shut up! Shut her up! The Mantrangas were ambushed tonight. Those two apes, your brothers, were the gunman. Come back here! These have just been fired. I can smell it. Wait for me in the other room. You boys always sleep with your shoes on? Arrest them. All right, come along. You're making a big mistake. Just count yourself lucky nobody in that wagon died. Pardon the intrusion, missus. Uh, vegetables... dangerous? Ah! Grazie... Um... thank you. "Gaspare," "please meet me tonight" "at Clay statue..." Go on, go on! "10:00 o'clock." "Megan." Why so late? Hey, her parents will be in bed, you know? William Villere. Oh, would you look at that uniform. About the only reason to join the Boylan protective police. I saw your lights. You workin' on the Provenzano business? Aye. Ain't much of a case, is it? One dago's word against another's. The jury will decide. Hell, I'd love to be on that jury. A quick way of making a buck. Tell you what, let's get some oysters on the way home, I'll walk you. Good. I'm going with Sheriff Villere. He'll look after me. Okay, chief. Won't you, Bill? Yep. Oh, can you see anything? In this, you must be joking. Listen, Billy. When you're ready to leave Boylan and join the real police force, you let me know. You must be dog tired of havin' to step and fetch it for Mayor Joe Shakspeare. Here we are. Thanks for walking me, lad. You get yourself home safe, now. 'Night, Chief. Billy... Billy... Billy... Billy... Who did it? Did you see? I... Dagos. That's what the chief told me. Dagos. We're looking after you, David. After him! Megan! Gaspare! No, no, no, no! All prisoners to remain in the holding pen until they've been booked by the arresting officer. I demand Italian consul! I didn't see nothing. I swear on my mother's grave. What were you running for? To get away from the shootin', that's all. I'm walking. The fog's thick like pea soup, I hear guns. Now, I don't know if somebody's robbin' somebody or what, but I know better than to be around something like that. I got a big problem, Samuel. I got a dead hero who happens to be the police chief. And I got a nigger running from the scene of the crime. Now, he lives across the street from where the chief was shot. Samuel? Come on, Samuel. Come on, boy. Yeah, him. Looks like him. Yeah, looks like him, too. That's it, that's all. I got people that said it was four. I want four, Samuel, now you think. Somebody's going to jail, boy. Who's it gonna be? Them... they look pretty much like 'em. God forgive me. Chief David Hennessy was murdered, by an Italian criminal organization called the Mafia in Sicily. Tragically, it has arrived with the Italian immigrants that we have welcomed to New Orleans. David Hennessy knew the danger of these Italian groups. He lost his life fighting them. His death must not be in vain! We must teach these people a lesson they will not forget! Gaspare! Gaspare! Gaspare! Yeah, go back! Hold up your heads! You are innocent! Joseph "Macheeca." He's the boss of the conspiracy. They do what he tells them. Charles Mantranga, he planned it with "Macheeca." Pietro Monasterio, shoemaker. Lived across from where the chief was shot. They used his shop to prepare. Bastian Incompara, a criminal in Italy. Got an eyewitness says he was running away carrying a gun. Same as Emmanuel Polizzi. Angelo Bagnetto and Umberto Scaffidi. Both identified by witnesses. Antonio Marchesi, identified as one of the gunmen. Gaspare Marchesi, seen at Monasterio's. He whistled to tell the gunmen the chief was coming. How come you don't have a witness that says "Macheeca" was one of the shooters? Because 300 witnesses say he was in the theater watching the show with Mantranga at the time of the shooting. Conspiracy is the best he'll do. Any of them confess? Not yet. Goddammit, Billy. Billy here, will get a confession. Everything will be fine, James, just be patient. I'm not walking with them, pretending like I wish he weren't dead. Shut up. Show a little bit of respect and take off your hat. For what? You hated him. I'm not talking about Hennessy. He's a dead bastard. I'm talking about my new friends here. What friends? Are any of you guilty? Then why aren't you angry? They may take our freedom, but you take your own dignity! We're just the dagos. That's what they want! They want you to think you're nothing! Don't give that to them! We will have justice, I'll give you my word. I don't believe I have enough evidence to hold some of these men, let alone convict them. It's your job as district attorney to deliver a verdict of guilty. Mr. Mayor, I'm telling you the reality. We are holding Joseph Macheca. For what? He wasn't even there. Neither was Mantranga. Damnit, man, they're the heads of a conspiracy. Conspir... What conspiracy? Both these men are rich. They have nothing to gain and everything to lose. What's their motive? Hennessy had information that would acquit Georgio and Paolo Provenzano. "Macheeco" did not want that information coming out. Why would Hennessy testify for the Provenzanos? He's the one who arrested them. No, Mr. Mayor. This old dog won't hunt. This is a very weak case. Not for a talented lawyer like you, Mr. Luzenberg. Not for someone whose job is on the line. Well... a confession or two would make life easier. Stranger things have happened. Keep his head up. Gaspare... I take care of him. We have to take care of each other. Why? Hey, I remember you. You fought with the young Provenzano boy. For your honor. I dream to be like you. Respected. You dreamed of being like me? Well, now you are. You want respect? Behave as though you deserve it. Look at your father. He risked everything for you to come here. You are his hope. Where is my hope? Inside yourself. We have nothing. Why they hate us? Look what we have achieved. They brought us here to be their servants. In less than a generation, we threaten to be their masters. When we work together we can do anything. When we work together, they call us Mafia. They say Mafia to create fear. We are protected by laws and by justice. We do not need the Mafia. Signore Macheca, you have money. Maybe laws protect you. In the war, I fought with the Louisiana infantry for those laws. I saw men give their lives for those laws. They are mine and they are yours, and they will not forsake us. Sheriff Villere. Tom Semmes, Jesus. Now what's a former attorney general doing taking money from a murderin' dago? You got no pride? Sheriff Villere, how are you? Tell me you come to stay for a while, O'Malley. Kill anyone today, sheriff? "Macheeca," your attorney's here. Thank you, Warden Davis. Joseph, this is insane. We'll have you out of here right away. I don't want any harm to come to you because you are my lawyer. This is Dominic O'Malley, and this is Robert Collins. They are private detectives, they will be assisting us in our investigations. Thank you for coming, gentlemen. If they beat me, I tell them Macheca did it. I don't die for him. Now, it seems like they don't have much to hold you on. The best they can hope for here is conspiracy. And I think that's wishful thinking. No matter what they wish, I have a right to fair trial. And you will get one. Can you make sure they will as well? I beg your pardon? I want you to represent all of us. There are two charges filed against each of you. Lyin' in wait to commit murder, and murder. Now right now, there are 19 other Italians held on the same charges. Nine of you are set to go to trial first. They are all innocent, Thomas. No one's confessed, that's a start. They've beaten them pretty bad. What we need from you is to tell us where you were on the night, and then we will check to see if your alibis stand up. I was with Mantranga at the theater. We have plenty of witnesses. Charles Mantranga. All right, uh, anybody else? Whoa, whoa, wait, for God's sake now. All right, now what's your name? Incompara. Incompara. Mr. Collins, will you write this down? Now, the rest of you, please sit quietly and wait. I will get to each one of you, don't worry. Papa... Oh... Gaspare... No... Capice?! Gaspare Marchesi? Where were you when Hennessy was killed? I take shoes to Pietro Monasterio for Don Mantranga. Where was your father? He go for a walk. Tom Semmes, Goddamnit! Now he's a real lawyer. He used to be attorney general, for Pete's sake. Now, how the hell did "Macheeca"...? Calm yourself, Mr. Mayor. All we need is confession. Have you heard from Sheriff Villere yet? Your job just got harder, Mr. Luzenberg. Dominic O'Malley has tried to bribe juries in the past. And I don't think the leopard's gonna change his spots. We've got to find out what their side is thinking before they do. Surely, one of them will cooperate. Gentlemen, I don't want to hear this. Well, Mr. Luzenberg, maybe you oughtta get back to work. Be careful what you say around the D.A. He has a very naive view of how justice is accomplished. Who was it you had in mind? I don't mean to be a pessimist, but if we lose one, I think there's a good chance the jury could convict them all. Most of these alibis rely on the testimony of Italians. I wouldn't count on the jury believing 'em. Well, they don't have a case. They've got nothing but rumor that links Mantranga and Macheca to it. But if they sell the jury the conspiracy, it may be enough. They may not have a case but neither do we. Do you remember what it was like that night? Fog so thick you couldn't see 10 feet in front of you. To have seen anything, they'd have had to been standing next to the gunmen. With the amount of lead flyin' around, it's a miracle no one got hit. Are you saying they were coached? You'll never prove that. Well, we could put reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury. With all the noise Mayor Shakspeare's makin' reasonable doubt won't be enough. He's right. We've got to prove they're liars. Which shouldn't be too difficult, seeing as they are. As my sainted mother used to say... O'Malley, you never had a mother. What, what do you have in mind? I still have friends in uniform. I'll make up a list of all their witnesses and Rob and I can pay 'em a visit. 'Morning, 'morning. Who's the fellow who looks like he's going to a wedding? Pasquale Corte, Italian Consul. The other two? Reporters. Tell them to come in, all of them. Mr. Corte, gentlemen. Mr. Consul, how may I be of service? Gentlemen, please sit down. These are reporters. We've got nothing to hide, do we? I have come to register a formal complaint about the treatment of the Italian men who were arrested. Arrested for...? The murder of Chief Hennessy. Ah, murder, yes, yes, of course. You see, there are a great many Italians who get arrested. I just wanted to make sure we were singing from the same song sheet. Now, since you're here, I wonder if you could explain the Italian government sending thousands of criminals they don't want, to us, here, in New Orleans. What? Well, I suppose it's a good way to rid yourself of a problem, but frankly, we don't want your thieves and murderers. So tell your government, if you ship us your lawbreakers, we're gonna throw them in jail or ship them back. Mr. Mayor, the men of whom I speak have been treated shamefully. They have been beaten and abused by their guards. They cannot have visitors. I have informed the Italian ambassador in Washington. Well, Mr. Consul, sir, I'm gonna ask Sheriff Villere to investigate this situation and instigate any reforms that he deems appropriate. Sound fair? Yes. Gaspare... No, mama. Si. Megan? Si, Megan. No talking Italian. What do the lawyers say? You don't worry about nothing. We'll all be there in court for you. Gaspare... Don't talk to them, Tony. Let's go. Ciao. Ciao. Mr. Peeler, are you there? Collins, forget it, there's plenty more. Let's keep moving. Who's next? Bartender, John Duare. John Duare? He don't work here no more. Samuel Foster, Samuel... No, I ain't seen him for a long while. Just up and disappeared. She ain't here. When will Miss Wheeler be back? Didn't say, y'all done yet? It's as if they knew we were coming. I have a bad feeling. It's like this one's already bought and paid for. I hear the Provenzano brothers are getting out. The Provenzano brothers. Hey! To Mr. James Houston, a man of his words. Hey, Joe. And may Macheca and Mantranga burn in hell. Heh? Giovanni... Hey, Giovanni... Wait. You don't look happy. You wish your brothers were still in prison? Is that what you wish? It is not what I wish. No. You wish that I had failed. We are not dagos anymore. We are part of New Orleans now. And I gave us that. Is that what you gave us? That's right, step aside. It is better for you and better for the Provenzanos. Antonio... we get fresh air. No, no, papa. Antonio. No. He's dancing. Music, music, come on. Have your fun. Come on, dance! Go. Play the music, play the music. Play the music. Son, I want you to look me in the eye and tell me, did your father kill Mr. Hennessy? No. Well, then you better tell me he was. Because he's got no alibi. Do you understand? As sure as the sun rises in the morning, he'll hang. Delores Johnson. Who? Delores Johnson. She'll swear Marchesi was with her at the Red Lantern at the time Hennessy was killed. She knows him well. He's been there more than once. A jury's gonna believe a whore? Why would she lie? Marchesi was arrested right in front of the place. The police reports give her credibility. That's not proof. Well, it's the best we got. It's all we've got. Alright, let's get a deposition. But you'll have to look after her until she can testify. Oh, ain't that a tragedy. O'Malley? That's me. You dago lovin' piece of shit. I came to see Mr. Houston. You can say that Vincent Provenzano is here. He said to come at night. How do I look? Fine. Has anything I told you would happen not been true? No. So, stop being nervous. Mr. Houston is not able to see you. Go back inside and tell him that Vincent Provenzano is waiting here. Mr. Houston. I just thought I'd pass by, and thank you for what you did for my brothers, Georgio and Paolo. I don't know what you're talking about. Sure, I understand. Anyhow... I just want to let you know that, whenever you're ready, we can sit down and talk about our business together. Business, I don't do business with dagos. Dagos! You think I'm dagos, I'm gonna kill you! Vincenzo, come on! You, you're the dagos! Vincenzo, calm down! Let's go, come on! Vincenzo, come on, we're gonna get out of here. ♪ Vincenzo, where you going? I'm gonna kill that lying bastard. Georgio, Paolo, come on. Give them back the guns, Giovanni. We're gonna make Houston pay now. Pay? Pay for what? He lied to me. He promised and he lied. And no one betrays Vincenzo Provenzano. Georgio, Paolo, let's go. You kill him, you kill all of us with one bullet. Georgio, Paolo, let's go. I got you out, let's go! Tony, you come with me. Antonio, stay here. Tony, you come with me. Tony. He promised... and he lied, Giovanni! He lied! What did he promise you? He promised me the future. He promised me that I would be American. Vincenzo. He promised me, Giovanni. He promised me. Did you kill Hennessy? Vincenzo, tell me. I swear on my mother, I didn't kill anyone. I believe you. You want to be American?! Look what America's done to you! To all of us. Honey, you look like you've had enough. Anyways, we ain't open. I need to speak to Delores Johnson. Delores is gone. Where'd she go? They never really say, I never really ask. Where the devil have you been? I got sandbagged. Delores is gone. Gone? How would they have known about the whore? We're the only ones who knew about her. Except the prisoners. The walls in that jail have ears. Poor, Goddamn, dagos. I bet they wish they'd stay in Palermo. Hey. All rise... the court of the city of New Orleans is now in session. Honorable Joshua G. Baker presiding. You are charged with the murder of metropolitan police chief David Hennessy, and lying in wait to commit his murder. How do you plead? Your Honor the defense moves for a postponement. We've had not had the opportunity to interview the prosecution witnesses. You've had amble opportunity, Mr. Semmes. Motion denied. Let's proceed with the jury selection. I think they could wash a bit more. Otherwise, I like 'em fine. No, thank you. You may step down. Justice is the glue that holds us together. Everyone's entitled to it. Even a dago. Would you take your hat or whatever it is, off, sir? It is my custom. Well, it is my custom that you take it off. Do you respect the law, sir? I try to respect the law of both man and God. I hope we all do. Mm. I buy from them but no I don't employ any. Never had no trouble with them. May I remind the gentlemen of the jury not to discuss this case with anyone. And To keep your minds open to all the evidence presented. Mr. Luzenberg, will you be ready to present the people's case in the morning? Certainly, Your Honor. Very well. In that case, this court is adjourned. The judge was out of line ruling against the postponement. Maybe O'Malley's right, maybe this whole thing is just an exercise. I pray to God you're both mistaken. I've got good news. We could use some. I went back to the Red Lantern. There's an old whore there who'll corroborate that Marchesi was with Delores Johnson. Did you talk to her? I'm meetin' her tonight at her place, 9:00 o'clock. Um, thirty... 39 Strathern Street. Good work. There's no witness here for you to intimidate, Collins. Do you want me to shoot them? Collins, why? It was a great deal of money. Get out. Collins, can't believe it. Oh, it's a... it's a wicked old world. Now what? We can move for a mistrial. Mr. Semmes, you and I both know that's not gonna happen. I heard shots. I ran out of the bar toward the shooting. When I got there, four men were standing across the road from the chief still firing at him. Then they ran off. Do you see them in the court? Yes, sir. Him... that fella... him... and him. Let the record show that he has identified. Pietro Monasterio, Umberto Scaffidi, Emmanuel Polizzi, and Antonio Marchesi. Your witness. So, you were working in the bar that night and you heard shooting? Heard it, ran out, saw it. Really foggy that night, wasn't it? Why you looking at Sheriff Villere here? Is he is expert on fog? It was foggy. So you must have gotten real close to the gunmen to see their faces in the fog. Yes, sir, they ran right into me. Hm, well, they just shot the chief, and they run right by you, and close enough to see their faces in the fog, huh? And you're an eyewitness. Yes, sir. And these are ruthless killers. Yes, they were. So, why didn't they shoot you? Objection, he's asking the witness to speculate. Sustained. Maybe they didn't see you. Maybe. 'Cause of the fog. Do you keep a gun behind your bar? No crime in that. So you heard shooti" and you ran out. Why? I mean, most people don't like being shot at. I felt maybe somebody was being robbed. I thought maybe I could help, be a good citizen. Well, you certainly are a brave citizen. You heard shooting, and you ran out. Did you take your gun with you? No, I don't think I did. Because if you had, you could have used it to assist Chief Hennessy, being a good citizen. Now, you heard shooting, and you ran out, and you didn't take your gun with you? Mr. Duare, you're under oath. Did you really run out, did you really see anything that night? I told you what I saw and I ain't changing my story. Well, at least we can agree it is a story. Objection! Withdrawn. He told me he whistled five times. And that's how they knew the chief was coming. Do you see him in the court? That one there. Let the record show he has identified Gaspare Marchesi. Mr. Semmes. Where did you first meet Gaspare Marchesi? Parish Prison. Why were you in Parish Prison? Stealing food, but I was innocent. Yeah, well, I'm sure you are. There's a lot of innocent men in Parish Prison. Now, Gaspare Marchesi confesses to you. Why, you his best friend? I think he was bragging. Said his daddy and a fella called Polizzi shot the chief and that he turned state's evidence. Ratted on 'em to save himself. He lie! That's enough, young man. I want you to keep your client in his seat and quiet. Yes, Your Honor. But you might understand why he is angry. Because he has not turned state's evidence. Has he, Mr. Luzenberg? Just telling you what he said. Maybe he was lying. Maybe you are. Objection. I think that is a fair comment. So do I, overruled. You in Parish Prison now? No. Why not? The charges was dropped. If the charges were dropped, why were you in jail with Mr. Marchesi? They don't give you a choice when they arrest... I bet they gave you a choice, didn't they William? You don't have to answer that. The others was running away. Didn't see their faces, but I saw Mr. Monasterio standing maybe 10 feet from the chief's body. God rest his soul. So, Pietro Monasterio did not run away as Mr. Duare has testified? He was standing right there. Did you see him shoot the chief? No, sir. Did he have a gun? No, sir. How was he dressed? In the underclothes. That must have been quite a sight. Yes, sir. So he managed to get rid of his gun and his clothes after he shot the chief. Just telling you what I see. And I thank you for it. Nothing further. The people call Samuel Foster. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Mr. Foster. You were on Gerard Street the night of Chief Hennessy's murder? Yeah, I was. And you told Sheriff Villere that you saw the shooting? Yeah. Do you see the men who shot Chief Hennessy in this courtroom? No. I'm sorry? You identified the gunmen for Sheriff Villere. Yeah, I did. But they ain't here. Do you know the penalty for perjury, Mr. Foster?! That's why I'm telling you the truth. Which is what I just swore to do. Scusa, sir, Luzenberg... "So, Mr. Monasterio," "what exactly" "you underwear look like, huh?" "Like yours, but not so big!" Joe Macheca, do you think maybe we can go out before the king's birthday, possibly? Yes, it's all possible now. You'll see. Grazie, Giuseppe. You always strong, always believe. Yes, I always believed, but, it's still not over. Listen, tomorrow in court, the prosecution... No... No, no, Gaspare! I saw that fellow there shoot the chief. He kept shooting him even when he's lying on the ground. He's identified Umberto Scaffidi. And that one, he shot him, as well. He had a single shot rifle. He kept loading and firing. He has identified Bastian Incompara. And him, he had a pistol. Emptied it in the chief, reloaded and kept firing. The witness has identified Emmanuel Polizzi. Bastard! Ahh! Get that man, get that man! Get that man! I do what you want! I do what you ask me! Macheca, Mantranga, they are head of the Mafia. They make vengeance on you and you, they make you die! I want Signore Polizzi's outburst stricken from the record. He's not mentally competent to stand trial at this time. Now I request an adjournment in order to reevaluate... Hold your horses, Mr. Semmes! The court will determine Mr. Polizzi's competence. There will be an adjournment for a doctor to evaluate his mental condition, then I'll rule. Sweet Jesus. The jury could see he was disturbed. Well, they could also hear the doctor telling him he was sane. You got better than a confession. They got their conspiracy, they got their Mafia. And every witness that we put up there to refute tomorrow, well, the jury could just disregard them as being part of the same conspiracy, now can't they? Where you going? You don't want to know. Why? Any Italian that succeeds he must be part of the Mafia. If I had the Mafia, I wouldn't be here for sure. Mr. Macheca, I'm gonna need some money. To buy the jury. I've paid for many things in my life. I never dreamed I would pay for my life. I'm innocent. That's why we're doing this. Hold it right there, O'Malley. What's all this? You're under arrest. You must be joking. Is that what it look like? What's this? Your laundry list? There can be no doubt that David Hennessy's death is the result of a criminal conspiracy. The confession of Emmanuel Polizzi, a man who threatened you, and Judge Baker, confirms their... guilt. So, the question is, should you feel threatened? Should you feel threatened? No. You should send a message that will tell these Italian criminals in our city, that we are not intimidated, we are not afraid to see justice done. Do not let the Mafia reach their black hand into this courtroom. You must find the courage to bring a guilty verdict. Conspiracy is vague, and frightening, but there is nothing to be afraid of here. You've seen the so-called witnesses. Instead of facts and credibility, we are fed a daily dose of hysteria. Now have the courage and the intelligence not to succumb to it. Do not join the angry mob baying for innocent blood. Protect these men. Whose only crime is their nationality. Thanks for paying my bail. So, Mr. O'Malley, did you succeed in bribing the jury? Hell, no. Well, I was going to. But they got me first. We've got no chance at all. What is all this? The king of Italy. What? His birthday, it's a celebration. What's this? This proposal, I thought you might encourage the city council to pass. "Banning Italians from any labor" "or business on the docks." It's a crime fighting initiative to clean up those docks. Don't you agree, Mr. Parkerson? I do. We got a verdict. Mr. Foreman, have you reached a verdict? We have Your Honor. How say you? The city of New Orleans vs. Joseph Macheca for the murder of David Hennessy, the jury finds the defendant not guilty. Go, Macheca! The city of New Orleans vs. Charles Mantranga, the jury finds the defendant not guilty. Bravo, Don Mantranga! The city of New Orleans vs. Angelo Bagnetto, the jury finds the defendant not guilty. Kike! The city of New Orleans vs. Bastian Incompara, the jury finds the defendant not guilty. They killed him, they killed the chief! This is a Mafia! Bravo, bravo! The city of New Orleans vs. Gaspare Marchesi... - Jew bastard! - Murderer! Why'd you let them go!? ...the jury finds the defendant not guilty. The city of New Orleans vs. Antonio Marchesi, the jury finds the defendant not guilty. How much they paying you?! In the case of Umberto Scaffidi, Pietro Monasterio, and Emmanuel Polizzi, we are unable to reach a verdict. Silence! Silence in the court! The court will come to order! I order the defendants to be held in Parish Prison overnight and to appear in court tomorrow to hear charges of lying in wait. How can they lie in wait, Your Honor? They didn't commit the murder! I object! I object, Your Honor, that is illegal! Court is adjourned. Your Honor! Your Honor! Your Honor! If the jury won't give the people what they want then we have to. Not like this. Joe, could I speak with you privately? There's no way that jumped-up guinea's gonna make a monkey out of me, you understand? I have not gone to all this trouble to walk away empty handed. You mean... The people of New Orleans are looking for a leader. Mr. Mayor... give them one. Go on now, say a few good words. Mr. Parkerson will take care of the rest. Won't you, Bill? Of course. Joe... with you, without you, justice will be done. Now, listen, listen, everybody! Now! Now! Listen to me! There's nothing you can say to us. Our faith in American justice has been betrayed! Yeah! Each one of us... must search his conscience and decide whether he has the resolve to do what is necessary! Now let me finish! To do what is necessary... to see justice fulfilled! They bought the jury! They did what? They paid $50,000 for the verdict. I heard it was $100,000! Gaspare! Gaspare! We free, I meet you tomorrow. Where? Clay statue. I'm very happy for you, Signora Marchesi. Gentlemen, listen... Now don't worry, they have no legal rights to hold you. Now, tomorrow you'll all be free men. Joseph. You alright? They did not release us, Thomas. Well... don't worry. We're gonna have you out of here tomorrow. You get some sleep, hm. Sleep of the just. Okay? Thomas... thank you for trying. You get some sleep. "All good citizens "are invited to attend" "a mass meeting." "Saturday, March 14th" "at 10:00 o'clock..." Mayors office, City Hall, hurry! "...at Clay statue "to take steps" "to remedy the failure of justice" "in the Hennessy case." "Come prepared for action." We must leave New Orleans right now. I'm not going anywhere. I know you're not, what a waste. I need to speak with the mayor. Mayor's not here, Mr. Corte. Where is he? It's very important. I believe he's having breakfast with Governor Nicholls at the mansion. Mr. O'Malley! Mr. O'Malley! Judge Baker is not here, sir. Where is he? I haven't seen him. Is the mayor not here? I left word for the mayor. He's late for breakfast. Now, now, Mr. Corte, calm yourself. I'm sure it's gonna be a peaceful demonstration. It is time to take our city back from the Mafia. When the courts fail, the people must act! You thank God he didn't say it was a black man who killed the chief. Georgio, Paolo... Pietro, stand with me. Please! Please, signore... Stand aside. Warden Davis, you let these men out now, you hear me? I don't have that authority. Listen, if you can't protect them you must release them into my custody. They'll be protected just fine. And now, Mr. Semmes... you must excuse me. You know what is about to happen here, don't you? Warden! Warden! We walk into court as free men. And tonight we celebrate. We go to Storyville. Hey, hey, we don't rest until you are free with us, huh. You run, you hide! In 30 seconds I'm locking this place down! Guns! Give us guns. We need guns! You hide, you pray, it's the best I can do. Go, go! Get off me. I'm a civil officer of this court and I have a right to see my clients. You will be held morally responsible for anything that happens to them. There's them dagos' lawyer! Get him, get the bastard! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hold on. Hold it! We'll handle it from here, boys. Down here. Gaspare! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Hey! Get the door, get the door! We are innocent men. Here's one still breathing! Gaspare, Gaspare! Come on, boys! Over here! This way! Live! Our work is done! We got all of them! Go home now and God bless you all. God bless you, sir! Did any of them survive? While the "New York Times" did not condone the largest lynching in American history, they did point out that the mob had done the jury's work for them. Theodore Roosevelt called the lynchings "rather a good thing." I knew if I spoke to my mother I could never obey my father's final instructions to leave this cursed place. For a time it looked as if there would be war between America and Italy, but President Harrison paid $25,000 and that was enough to make everyone forget. But we did not forget. A big statue was raised to Chief Hennessy, whose own murder was never solved. No one ever raised a statue to my father.
