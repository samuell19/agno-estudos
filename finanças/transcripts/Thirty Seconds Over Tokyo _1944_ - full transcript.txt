CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS. [AIRPLANE ENGINES] [BOMB WHISTLING] [THE U.S. AIR FORCE HYMN PLAYING] [INTERCOM BUZZES] YES. JUST A MINUTE. YOUR CALL, COLONEL. THANK YOU. THANKS. HELLO. CAPTAIN YORK, PLEASE. YOU KNOW, IF THIS THING WORKS OUT, IT MIGHT GIVE OUR BOYS, ALL THE WAY FROM BHUTAN TO SINGAPORE, A BIG LIFT, AND IT MAY PULL A LOT OF JAPS BACK TO THEIR ISLANDS. IT'LL WORK OUT, GENERAL. I'M SURE IT WILL. HELLO. HELLO, YORK? DOOLITTLE. YORK, I WANT YOU TO GET 24 B-25s WITH VOLUNTEER CREWS DOWN TO EGLIN FIELD AS SOON AS YOU CAN. THE JOB WILL TAKE THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS. TELL THEM IT'S A SECRET MISSION. THEY WON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING UNTIL THEY GET THERE. THAT'S RIGHT. VOLUNTEERS. TELL THEM THEY'RE NOT TO TALK TO ANYBODY. THAT'S AN ORDER. I'LL JOIN YOU IN A FEW DAYS. RIGHT. ARMY 0-22-41 TO EGLIN TOWER. THREE B-25s REQUEST TRAFFIC AND LANDING INSTRUCTIONS. GO AHEAD. Radio: ARMY 4-1, THE LEFT-HAND PATTERN. WIND DIRECTION NORTH BY NORTHEAST. LAND ON RUNWAY NUMBER 3. THERE'S THE FIELD, ALL RIGHT. BOY, DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH A WIDE RUNWAY? SHE'S BIG, ALL RIGHT. YOU COULD ALMOST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND GET IN. BUT I'D GIVE PLENTY TO KNOW WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. YEAH, SO WOULD I. HEY, DON'T DO ANYTHING TILL I GET MY CAMERA. HOW DOES SHE LOOK FROM THE NOSE, CLEVER? GREAT. FLORIDA: PALM TREES, ALLIGATORS, BATHING BEAUTIES. HEY, THATCHER, HAVE A LOOK AT THE REAL COUNTRY. IT'S NOT AS PRETTY AS BILLINGS, SIR. DID YOU KEEP YOUR COOKIES THIS TRIP, THATCHER? YES, SIR. I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE COMING OVER THE MOUNTAINS, BUT I HUNG ON! Radio: 0-22-41 IN FLIGHT. WAIT A MINUTE. GO AROUND, MAKE AN ECHELON RIGHT, ONCE OVER THE FIELD, THEN BREAK AWAY. LET'S MAKE IT PRETTY. HERE'S FOR LUCK. SWITCHES OFF. 5:25. NOT BAD TIME. YEAH, WE MOVED. BETTER WRITE THAT LEFT ENGINE UP. SHE SOUNDED A LITTLE ROUGH. BOY, I GOT SOME SWELL SHOTS, LAWSON. YOU REALLY MADE A NICE BREAKAWAY. GAVE ME KIND OF AN ARTISTIC ANGLE. SOMEDAY, I'LL DO A CRASH LANDING SO YOU CAN GET A REAL MOVIE. THATCHER SAYS THAT FLORIDA CAN'T COMPARE TO BILLINGS. TROUBLE WITH THATCHER IS HE THINKS THAT ANY PLACE WITH MORE THAN 300 PEOPLE IS OVERCROWDED. ACCORDING TO THE LAST CENSUS, SIR, BILLINGS HAS A POPULATION OF 16,380. 16,000! OH, NO, THATCHER. YOU MUST BE THINKING OF GREATER BILLINGS. NO, HE'S RIGHT, CLEVER. THEY COUNT THE COWS UP IN THAT COUNTRY. SORRY, SIR. YES? CAMERAS AREN'T ALLOWED ON THE FIELD. WHAT? THAT'S RIGHT, SIR. A LOT OF SECRET WORK GOES ON HERE, AND THEY'RE VERY STRICT ABOUT IT. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING SECRET FROM HERE. I'LL HAVE TO REPORT YOU TO THE COMMANDING OFFICER, SIR. THOSE ARE MY ORDERS. OK, OK. H-HEY, LOOK. BRICK HOLSTROM'S STILL WITH US. WE WERE AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T GET THAT TURKEY IN TILL TOMORROW. WHY, THAT BABY FLIES SO PRETTY, WE FLOATED THE LAST 200 MILES. [LAUGHING] YOU GUYS READY? YEAH. COME ON, BRICK. OH, THATCHER, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK TO TELL YOU WHERE YOUR QUARTERS ARE. YES, SIR. COME ON, DAVEY. YOU'VE GOT AN IDEA. WHAT'S THE DOPE? WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? I ALREADY TOLD YOU. ALL HE SAID WAS IT WOULD TAKE US OUT OF THE COUNTRY, WE'D BE GONE ABOUT 3 MONTHS, AND IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS. LOOK, I GOT THE REAL DOPE FROM JOE RANDALL. HE SAYS A FOREIGN PATROL SQUAD HAS TO GUARD THE CANAL. WHAT'S DANGEROUS ABOUT CANAL PATROL? WELL, WHAT ARE WE WORRYING ABOUT? SKI'LL GIVE US ALL THE DOPE WHEN WE CHECK IN ANYHOW. 3 SHIPS IN, SIR. HOLSTROM, LAWSON, AND MYSELF. GOOD. THESE SHIPS OK? YES, SIR. SIT DOWN. WHERE ARE WE STAYING, SKI? THE GOVERNMENT'S LEASED A HOTEL NEAR HERE. THEY CALL IT "THE OFFICERS' CLUB." THE MEN WHOSE WIVES ARE COMING CAN STAY THERE. THE OTHER OFFICERS' QUARTERS ARE IN BARRACKS 5. IS EMMY COMING DOWN? SHE'LL BE HERE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. WHERE WILL I PUT THATCHER, SKI? THE ENLISTED MEN ARE ASSIGNED TO BARRACKS 12. OK. UH, ANYTHING ELSE? NOPE. AT LEAST NOT UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING. WELL, WE'LL BE SEEING YOU. SAY, SKI, THE GUYS ARE ALL CRAZY TO KNOW WHAT'S UP. YOU KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT IT AS I DO. WE MAY BE GIVEN MORE INFORMATION IN THE MORNING. MM-HMM. ["CHATTANOOGA CHOO CHOO" PLAYING] PAUL, YOU COME IN. HA HA! WHOA! WELL, BEAT ME, DADDY! LOOK WHO'S COMING. WELL, WELL, WELL! PLANT ME NOW AND DIG ME LATER! IF IT ISN'T THE PRIDE OF RANDOLPH FIELD. HOW ARE YOU, BOY? GREAT, SHORTY. THE MINUTE WE HEARD THAT RAZZMATAZZ, WE KNEW YOU MUST BE SOMEWHERE AROUND. YOU VOLUNTEER FOR THIS DEAL, TOO? SURE ENOUGH. THEY HAD ME STATIONED UP IN MINNEAPOLIS-- COLDEST COUNTRY I EVER DID SEE! I'D HAVE VOLUNTEERED FOR ANYTHING TO GET BACK IN THE SUNSHINE. WHERE YOU BEEN? COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA. BOB! HELLO, TED. YOU GUYS KNOW EACH OTHER? WELL, WE JUST WENT THROUGH KELLY TOGETHER, THAT'S ALL. SURE, BOB WAS BRIDESMAID AT MY WEDDING. WEDDING?! NOBODY TELLS ME ANYTHING ANYMORE! HOW LONG YOU BEEN BALLED UP AND CHAINED DOWN? 6 MONTHS IN... IN 5 MORE DAYS. WELL, BLOW MY FOOT OFF! SKIN ME AGAIN, BOY! HEY, DAVEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE? BRICK. HI, DON. I THOUGHT YOU WERE HUNTING SUBS. WAS. GOT ME ONE, TOO. YOU IN ON THIS DEAL? SURE. I'VE GOT A SWELL CREW, AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE SOMETHING. SO, WHY NOT? EH, ANY IDEAS WHAT WE MIGHT BE UP TO? OH, JUST A HUNCH. YEAH? WELL, GIVE. SOUTH SEAS. KNOCK OURSELVES OFF A FEW MEATBALLS. YEAH? ["DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS" PLAYING] THREE. HONEST MAN. DEALER TAKES TWO. YOU KNOW, I JUST GOT AN IDEA. ABOUT WHAT? ABOUT WHERE WE MIGHT BE GOING. THE WAY IT LOOKS TO-- OH, THAT'S NOT RIGHT. FORGET IT. SETS TWO. I GOT AN IDEA, TOO. YEAH? UH-HUH. I'VE GOT AN IDEA YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH OF A DOPE TO HAVE COME IN ON THIS DEAL IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHAT KIND OF CRACK IS THAT? OH, I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE MARRIED, YOU'VE GOT A SWELL GIRL... I WOULD HAVE NEVER STUCK MY NECK OUT IF I WERE IN YOUR BOOTS. AW, GO AWAY. YOU SAY TWO? MM-HMM. AND UP TWO. *...ALL THE LIVE-LONG DAY...* OOH, THOSE GUYS ARE OFF AGAIN. * THE EYES OF TEXAS ARE UPON YOU * * YOU CANNOT GET AWAY * Shorty: McKAY, STAND UP, WON'T YOU? WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? *...AT NIGHT AND EARLY IN THE MORN...* HAVE YOU EVER CARRIED A NAVIGATOR IN YOUR SHIP BEFORE, SPIKE? UH-UH. NEITHER HAVE I, UNTIL I VOLUNTEERED FOR THIS JOB. WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME FANCY STUFF, ALL RIGHT. I KIND OF GOT A FEELING-- Shorty: SHOOT ME FOR A POLECAT! DO I SEE TWO RED-BLOODED CITIZENS LYING ON THEIR BACKSIDES WHILE THE TEXAS ANTHEM IS BEING RENDERED? ON YOUR FEET, MEN. WHAT ARE YOU BEEFING ABOUT, SHORTY? YOU'RE FROM VIRGINIA. THAT'S RIGHT, SHOTCAT, BUT MY PAL HERE, HE'S FROM TEXAS, AND HE TAKES OFFENSE EASY... HELLO, JOE. HELLO, JASE. GOT SOME NEWS. HEY, YOU GUYS. SHUT UP! WHAT'S UP? Joe: QUIET, FELLAS. LISTEN. JIMMY DOOLITTLE'S DOWN HERE, AND HE'S A LIEUTENANT COLONEL NOW. [MEN MURMURING] Shorty: JIMMY DOOLITTLE! A SOUTHERN BOY FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. LET'S HAVE "EYES OF TEXAS" FOR LT. COL. JIMMY DOOLITTLE. * THE EYES OF TEXAS ARE UPON YOU... * Officer: ATTENTION! GENTLEMEN, LT. COL. DOOLITTLE. AS YOU WERE. YOU MEN ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU VOLUNTEERED. YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD IT'S A DANGEROUS MISSION. I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY MORE THAN THAT NOW, BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE DANGER. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AT THE MOMENT IS SECRECY. I DON'T WANT YOU TO EVEN TELL YOUR WIVES WHAT YOU SEE DOWN HERE. AND IF YOU THINK YOU'VE GUESSED WHERE YOU'RE GOING YOU'RE PROBABLY WRONG, BUT DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT YOUR GUESS. IF THE SLIGHTEST WORD ABOUT THIS MISSION GETS AROUND, YOU WILL ENDANGER NOT ONLY YOUR OWN LIVES, BUT THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER MEN. NOW, I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. HAS ANYBODY TRIED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS? GOOD. IF ANYBODY ON THE FIELD OR OFF THE FIELD TRIES TO ENGAGE YOU IN CONVERSATION AS TO WHY YOU'RE HERE, NO MATTER HOW INNOCENTLY, I WANT YOU TO GET HIS NAME AND GIVE IT TO ME, AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE FBI. [DOOR OPENS] THIS IS GOING TO BE THE TOUGHEST TRAINING YOU'VE EVER HAD. YOU WILL HAVE THE SAME CREW ALL THE WAY THROUGH, AND THE SAME SHIP, AND THE MAN OR THE SHIP THAT FAILS WILL BE DROPPED. YOU'RE GOING TO DO THINGS WITH A B-25 YOU THOUGHT WERE IMPOSSIBLE. NOW, IF ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS, I'D LIKE YOU TO DROP OUT, RIGHT NOW, AND I PROMISE YOU THAT NO ONE WILL EVER THINK THE WORSE OF YOU. IF YOU HAVE WIVES OR CHILDREN OR ANY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THAT MIGHT GET ON YOUR NERVES IN A CRISIS, IT'S PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT'S YOUR DUTY TO DROP OUT. VERY WELL. WE'LL HAVE THESE TALKS AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S ALL. Officer: WE'RE GOING UP THIS MORNING FOR AN ORIENTATION FLIGHT. THERE ARE 4 AUXILIARY FIELDS: 1, 2, 3, 4. LINE THEM UP AND LOCATE THEM ALL. WE DON'T KNOW WHICH WE'RE GOING TO USE FOR OUR CONFIDENTIAL EXPERIMENTS, SO FAMILIARIZE YOURSELVES WITH ALL OF THEM. LOOK OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE, AND WE'LL MEET HERE AGAIN AT 3:30 THIS AFTERNOON. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS? SIR, THE PLUGS ARE BEING CHANGED IN MY ENGINES. TO SAVE TIME, MAY I GO ALONG IN JONES' SHIP? RIGHT, SMITH. ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN GO TO YOUR SHIPS NOW. LOOKS TO ME LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG TIME BEFORE YOU SWING DOWN MAIN STREET OF BILLINGS AGAIN, THATCHER. IN BILLINGS, SIR, THE MAIN STREET IS MINNESOTA AVENUE. [AIRPLANE] YOU KNOW, THAT GUY REALLY MEANS BUSINESS. HE HAD ME SWEATING A LITTLE. YEAH, ME TOO. LT. LAWSON? YES. SOMEONE TO SEE YOU IN FRONT OF THE PX AT JAY STREET, SIR. THANKS. I WONDER WHO WOULD-- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CAR HORN BEEPS] ELLEN! WHERE DID YOU COME FROM? I DROVE TO CAROLINA TO SURPRISE YOU, THEN THEY TOLD ME YOU'RE DOWN HERE. WELL. WELL, HOW ARE YOU? I'M JUST FINE, THANK YOU, AND HOW ARE YOU BEARING UP? OH, GREAT. YOU LOOK JUST THE SAME. OF COURSE I DO. YOU CAN'T EXPECT ANY CHANGE THIS SOON. HUH? [LAUGHING] WHAT'S THE JOKE? NOTHING, EXCEPT YOU'RE SO FUNNY. TELL ME, HONEY, WERE YOU SURPRISED? OH, I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES! HEY, LET ME BUY YOU A DRINK. GEE, I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU. HA HA HA! [WOLF WHISTLES] COME ON, LET'S GO AROUND HERE. [WOLF WHISTLES] TELL ME, HONEY, HOW COME YOU'RE SO CUTE? I HAD TO BE IF I WERE GOING TO GET SUCH A GOOD-LOOKING FELLA. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I WANT TO TALK OVER WITH YOU. GO AHEAD. WERE YOU--WERE YOU REALLY SURPRISED? WELL, NO. NOT EXACTLY. YOU KNOW, YOU GO INTO SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITH YOUR EYES OPEN, AND NATURALLY, YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE YOUR CHANCES. I SEE. ISN'T THAT KIND OF A COLD-BLOODED WAY TO LOOK AT IT? OH, NOW, NOW, DON'T GET MAD. YOU'VE GOT TO BE COLD-BLOODED ABOUT IT. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME. WHAT ABOUT ME? YOU'RE IN ON IT, TOO. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO TALK IT OVER. THAT'S VERY GENEROUS. GO ON, TED. WELL, IN THE FIRST PLACE, WE'VE GOT TO KEEP IT A SECRET. I DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL A SOUL. YOU'RE NOT--I MEAN, YOU DON'T WISH IT HADN'T HAPPENED, DO YOU? OH, NO, OF COURSE NOT, BUT IT'S A MILITARY SECRET. I'VE GOT MY ORDERS. A MILITARY SECR-- SAY, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THIS JOB I VOLUNTEERED FOR. DIDN'T YOU GET MY LETTER? NO. DIDN'T YOU GET MINE? NO. OH! HA HA HA! I SUPPOSE IT'S VERY FUNNY, BUT... HEY, LAWSON. TED LAWSON. HERE. WHAT ARE YOU HIDING OUT-- ELLEN, WHEN DID YOU GET HERE? 5 MINUTES AGO. HOW'S MY BRIDESMAID? GREAT. ONLY I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK THIS UP. DOOLITTLE CAME OUT TO WATCH US TAKE OFF. OK. I'LL SEE YOU FOR DINNER. THERE'S A HOTEL ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF DOWN THE ROAD. I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, BUT THEY TELL ME YOU CAN'T MISS IT. I'LL FIND IT. I'M SORRY TO HAVE TO RUSH OFF LIKE THIS. OH, UH... DON'T FORGET DINNER. OH! SAY, DID ANYBODY PICK UP A LETTER FOR ME? UH, YES, SIR. I DID THIS MORNING. I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT. WELL, BRING IT UP. YES, SIR. I'M SORRY, SIR. OK. THANKS. TAKE OVER, WILL YOU, DAVENPORT? SURE. HEY! I'M GOING TO HAVE A BABY! HEY, IT'S FROM ELLEN! SHE'S GOING TO BE--I MEAN, I'M GOING TO BE A FATHER! CONGRATULATIONS! CONGRATULATIONS! * ROCK-A-BYE, BABY ON THE TREE TOP * * WHEN THE WIND BLOWS, THE CRADLE WILL ROCK * * WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS, THE CRADLE WILL FALL * * AND DOWN WILL COME BABY... * [UNZIPS JACKET] HELLO, FLIER. OH, I'M SORRY I WOKE YOU UP. I WASN'T SLEEPING, REALLY. I WAS JUST DOZING AND--THINKING. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T GET BACK FOR DINNER. WE HAD A LOT OF CHECKING TO DO. YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT I WAS AN AWFUL DOPE THIS MORNING, BUT I DIDN'T GET YOUR LETTER UNTIL LATER SO I DIDN'T KNOW. I KNOW. SIT DOWN. I, UH...I THINK IT'S SWELL ABOUT THE BABY. I KNEW YOU WOULD. I WASN'T A BIT WORRIED. YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO SEEM FUNNY. I DON'T CARE WHETHER IT'S A BOY OR A GIRL, NOT THAT MUCH. I JUST WANT YOU TO BE OK. IT'S PRETTY SERIOUS. [GIGGLES] WELL, WHAT'S SO FUNNY? I WAS JUST THINKING. HERE YOU'RE GETTING READY TO GO OFF ON SOMETHING REALLY TOUGH, AND YOU'RE WORRYING ABOUT ME. OH, IF I WERE IN YOUR SPOT, I'D BE SCARED TO DEATH, BUT I GUESS I AM ANYHOW. PURELY ROUTINE STUFF, FLIER. THE KIND OF JOB EVERY GIRL TAKES ON ONCE OR TWICE IN HER LIFE. WHY DON'T YOU LIE DOWN? YOU KNOW, ELLEN, I'M KIND OF GLAD I GOT YOU. UH-HUH. I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT IN MY SLEEP. IT ALMOST FRIGHTENED ME. IT SEEMED THAT I WAS THINKING-- WHAT IF I'D NEVER MET HIM? WELL, FOR ONE THING, YOU WOULDN'T BE TRAIPSING AROUND THE COUNTRY FROM ONE AIRFIELD TO ANOTHER TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH ME. AND FOR ANOTHER, YOU WOULDN'T BE HAVING A BABY RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR. OH, NO, IT WASN'T THAT. I WAS THINKING THAT IF I HADN'T MET YOU-- I'D NEVER FELT REALLY CLOSE TO ANYBODY. NEVER IN MY WHOLE LIFE. MARRIED 6 MONTHS, AND TOGETHER LESS THAN TWO WEEKS. THAT'S NOT BEING AS CLOSE AS I FIGURE. DON'T YOU SEE, TED? THAT'S JUST IT. IF PEOPLE CAN BE CLOSE WHEN THEY'RE FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER, WELL, THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULD BE. YEAH. YEAH, I GUESS SO. CUDDLE ME. HA! I WAS THINKING ABOUT LAST CHRISTMAS AND THE TREE WE SET OUT IN THAT PORTLAND AUTO COURT. WASN'T IT AN AWFUL LITTLE ROOM? HA HA! YEAH. AND THE CHRISTMAS DINNER WE WERE PLANNING ON, AND THEN YOU RAN OUT OF GAS AND LANDED IN THE MUD UP IN AVOCA. CHRISTMAS EVE AND CHRISTMAS WERE ALL OVER BEFORE I SAW YOU AGAIN. YEAH, THAT WAS TOUGH, BUT I GOT A SCARF OUT OF IT, ANYHOW. WELL, IT WASN'T EXACTLY AS YOU PLANNED IT. IT WAS OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS, AND SOMEWHERE WAY OFF-- IT DIDN'T MATTER WHERE-- I KNEW I HAD YOU. OH, TED. IT WAS THE NICEST CHRISTMAS OF MY LIFE. YOU WERE BORN TO MARRY A FLIER, ELLEN. I KNEW THAT THE MINUTE I FIRST SAW YOU. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THAT'S WHY I MARRIED YOU. YOU KNOW, I--I'VE GOT A CONFESSION TO MAKE. WHAT? THE TRUTH IS, YOU DIDN'T MARRY ME. I MARRIED YOU. OH, YOU DID, EH? UH-HUH. FIRST TIME I SAW YOU IN THE LIBRARY AT L.A.C.C., I SAID TO MYSELF, UH-OH, THAT'S FOR ME, AND FROM THEN ON CLEAR UP TILL THE NIGHT WE GOT THE JUDGE OUT OF BED IN THAT LITTLE IDAHO TOWN. NOTHING WAS AN ACCIDENT, TED. I--I PLANNED IT THAT WAY. YOU THINK YOU'RE PRETTY SMART, DON'T YOU? I'M NOT SURE WHETHER I DO OR NOT. YOU SEE, YOU DIDN'T PUT UP MUCH OF A FIGHT. I SUPPOSE YOU FIGURED ON THAT BABY, TOO. THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL NEVER KNOW, FLIER. YOU'LL NEVER KNOW. HA HA HA! [ENGINE RUNNING] BOYS ARE WORKING LATE THESE NIGHTS. YES. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW LONG YOU'LL BE GONE? UH-UH. BUT AS SOON AS THIS JOB IS OVER, I'M GOING TO ASK FOR A LEAVE. TWO, MAYBE 3 WEEKS. WE'LL HAVE THAT HONEYMOON YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT. YES, JUST THE THREE OF US. HA HA HA! TED? MM-HMM? I--I DO HOPE I DON'T GET BIG AND FAT, LIKE THAT LADY IN CHICAGO. I WANT EACH ONE OF YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE OTHER MAN'S JOB. THE PILOTS WILL PRACTICE EVERY JOB ON THE PLANE. NAVIGATORS WILL LEARN THE WORK OF BOMBARDIERS AND SO FORTH. THAT'S IN CASE ANY OF YOU GET SHOT UP. THERE'S ONE THING MORE. IT IS INEVITABLE THAT SOME OF YOUR PLANES ARE GOING TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. FOR THIS REASON, I HAVE ORDERED YOUR NORTON BOMB SIGHTS REMOVED. CAPTAIN GREENING HAS DESIGNED A SIGHT WHICH WILL BE PERFECT FOR OUR JOB. IF THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS, I'LL ASK CAPTAIN YORK TO TAKE OVER. JUST LIKE I SAID. WE PATROL OFF BRAZIL. YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT TAKING THE NORTON BOMB SIGHT OUT? THERE'S NO CHANCE OF FALLING INTO THE HANDS ENEMY IF YOU'RE HUNTING SUBS. I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT. THAT DOOLITTLE'S A CHEERFUL CUSS, ISN'T HE? JUST IN CASE ANY OF US ARE SHOT UP. A BUNDLE OF SUNSHINE. OH, IT'S TED. IT'S TED! GEORGE USED TO BUZZ ME WHEN WE WERE FIRST MARRIED. HE DOESN'T DO IT ANYMORE. THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO. I WONDER IF HE STILL LOVES ME. I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. EVERY TIME SKI GETS A NEW SHIP, HE HAS A TERRIBLE LOVE AFFAIR WITH IT. BUT HE ALWAYS COMES BACK TO ME. ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S HUNGRY. JUST THINK, THEY'LL BE GONE 3 MONTHS. I THINK I'LL GET A JOB IN A DEFENSE FACTORY. I COULDN'T STAND JUST SITTING AROUND SOME LITTLE APARTMENT AND WAITING. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, ELLEN? OH, I'M JUST GOING TO SIT AROUND AND...HAVE A BABY. A BABY! A BABY! ELLEN, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US? I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I JUST NEVER THOUGHT OF A WAY TILL NOW. AS IT TURNS OUT, IT WASN'T HARD TO TELL AT ALL. WELL, I'M GOING TO HAVE ONE, TOO. WHAT? REALLY? WELL, GEE, I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL. GEORGE AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT... WELL, WITH HIM AWAY AND ALL, I--I GUESS I'M JUST TOO SCARED. I THOUGHT I WOULD BE, TOO, BUT... WELL, TED AND I FIGURED THAT EVERYTHING SINCE PEARL HARBOR'S JUST BEEN SO MUCH VELVET... AND THEN I GUESSED THAT IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO HIM-- ONLY I KNOW NOTHING WILL-- I'D HAVE THE BABY, AND THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF TED STILL LIVING. I SOMETIMES WONDER HOW WE'LL FEEL WHEN IT'S ALL OVER. JUST THINK, BEING ABLE TO SETTLE DOWN IN A LITTLE HOUSE SOMEWHERE AND RAISE YOUR CHILDREN AND NEVER BE IN DOUBT ABOUT ANYTHING. WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME DOUBTS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. FOR EXAMPLE, WILL HE OR WILL HE NOT BE HOME FOR DINNER? Doolittle: WE'RE ABOUT TO ENTER THE MOST SECRET PART OF OUR TRAINING. THIS FIELD IS PATROLLED ON ALL SIDES SO NO ONE CAN DISTURB YOU AT YOUR WORK. GENTLEMEN, THIS IS LT. MILLER OF THE NAVY. HE'S GOING TO INSTRUCT YOU IN TAKEOFFS. INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL B-25 TAKEOFF, IN 1,500 FEET AT 90 MILES AN HOUR, HE'S GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO IT WITH A FULL LOAD OF BOMBS AND GAS IN 500 FEET AT 50 MILES AN HOUR. YOU WILL ATTEMPT NO SHORT TAKEOFFS FROM EGLIN FIELD WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE YOU. LT. MILLER WILL ALSO GIVE YOU A FEW SHORT TALKS ON NAVAL ETIQUETTE. NOW, IF THIS GIVES YOU ANY HINTS AS TO YOUR DESTINATION OR AS TO WHAT KIND OF WORK YOU'RE GOING TO DO, DON'T EVEN DISCUSS IT AMONG YOURSELVES. I'LL ASK LT. MILLER TO TAKE OVER NOW. Miller: GENTLEMEN, THOSE FLAGS OUT THERE ARE AT 100... 200... 300... 400... AND 500 FEET FROM THE STARTING LINE. THE LINE DOWN THE CENTER OF THE FIELD IS TO GUIDE YOU IN YOUR TAKEOFF. THE KIND OF WORK YOU'RE GOING TO DO WON'T PERMIT ANY DEVIATIONS. NOW, THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO GET UP FULL POWER BEFORE YOU RELEASE YOUR BRAKES, THEN START AT MAXIMUM R.P.M., MANIFOLD PRESSURE, AND WITH YOUR WING FLAPS ALL THE WAY DOWN. YOU'LL HAVE TO REV YOUR MOTORS UNTIL YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BURN UP, AND THEN, WHEN THEY REACH THE RIGHT PITCH-- AND THAT'S A MATTER OF SOUND AND FEEL MORE THAN INSTRUMENTS-- RELEASE YOUR BRAKES AND HUNT FOR HEAVEN. I DON'T EXPECT ANY OF YOU TO DO IT THE FIRST TIME. GRAY. YES, SIR? SUPPOSE YOU AND MANCH TRY IT FIRST. THE REST OF US WILL STAY ON THE GROUND AND WATCH YOU TAKE OFF AND CHECK THE WIND. YES, SIR. I THINK AT FIRST WE CAN LEARN AS MUCH BY WATCHING TRIAL RUNS AS BY ACTUALLY FLYING THE SHIPS. SO LET'S ALL LINE UP OVER HERE AND SEE HOW HE DOES. Miller: WHAT KIND OF SURFACE WINDS, SKI? 8 MILES AN HOUR. HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS ENGINES REVVED UP ENOUGH. LAWSON, YOU GO NEXT. NOW REMEMBER, FOR OUR PURPOSES, IF YOU GET YOUR WHEELS A FOOT OFF THE GROUND, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH. YOU DON'T NEED HEIGHT, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOUR WHEELS OFF BEFORE YOU HIT THE LAST FLAG. A LITTLE LATER WE'LL TRY RETRACTING THE WHEELS AT AROUND 450 FEET AND RELYING ON YOUR MOTORS TO FLOAT THE SHIP. DON'T TRY THAT JUST YET, THOUGH. Lawson: RIGHT, SIR. NOW, GRAB THE COLUMN AND PULL HER UNTIL YOU FEEL THE INSIDE OF YOUR BACKBONE. YES, SIR. DID YOU EVER TAKE OFF A B-25 IN 500 FEET, SIR? NO, BUT YOU MEN WILL. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WATCH LAWSON THERE. YOU'LL HAVE TO REV YOUR MOTORS AT LEAST THAT HIGH, MAYBE HIGHER. [SCREECH] ABOUT 700 FEET. BURNED HIS TAIL SKID. DIDN'T PULL HIS WHEELS UP SOON ENOUGH. BROTHER, THAT TAKEOFF WAS STRICTLY ON THE COB. THAT AIRPLANE OF YOUSE LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE A RUPTURED DUCK. HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS GUY? HE TAKES OFF LIKE AN OLD LADY IN A HIGH WIND, AND THEN HE'S GOT THE NERVE TO TALK ABOUT A REAL SHIP. IT'S LUCKY YOU DIDN'T HAVE A MUDDY FIELD, OR YOU'D STILL BE THERE. IF I WERE YOU, I'D WORRY ABOUT THAT TURKEY YOU AND GRAY ARE PUSHING AROUND THE SKY. THE RUPTURED DUCK WILL GET ALONG OK. OH, I'M INSULTED. COME ON, FELLAS. THAT WON'T TAKE LONG TO FIX, SIR. RUPTURED DUCK. TED. MM-HMM. DON'T YOU THINK LINDA'S A GOOD NAME, IF IT'S A GIRL? HUH? OH, YES, YES. IT'S FINE. MAYBE NICHOLA. NICHOLA. THAT HAS A NICE SOUND, DON'T YOU THINK? WHAT'S THAT? OH, YES. LOOK, HONEY, WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE THAT RIGHT NOW, DO WE? NO. TED. MM-HMM. HE WASN'T BADLY HURT, WAS HE? WHO? JOHNNY ADAMS. HOW'D YOU HEAR ABOUT JOHNNY? THOSE THINGS GET AROUND. HE WASN'T HURT, WAS HE? OF COURSE NOT. I DON'T KNOW HOW THOSE THINGS GET STARTED. EVERY TIME A GUY DOES A NOSE-OVER ON THIS FIELD, IT'S A CRACKUP. TED... YOU'VE BEEN WORKING EVER SINCE DINNER. COME ON. LET'S GET SOME AIR. IT'S A DEAL. MM. NICE. MM-HMM. I'M SORRY WE HAVEN'T HAD MORE TIME TOGETHER, ELLEN. WE CAN SPARE A LITTLE. WE'VE GOT ALL THE REST OF OUR LIVES. THAT'S RIGHT. IS SOMETHING BLOOMING? IT SMELLS GOOD, DOESN'T IT? TED. WHAT? PLEASE DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING. OH, I'M NOT WORRYING. I'M JUST WORKING, THAT'S ALL. YOU KNOW, THIS, UH...THIS IS GOING TO BE QUITE A DEAL. YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE DEAL. YOU'RE WORRIED BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A WIFE, AND THAT'S WRONG, TED. SAY, BOB GRAY HASN'T BEEN TRYING TO SCARE YOU, HAS HE? OF COURSE NOT. OK. BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. NOTHING. SILLY. AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. BESIDES, IF ANYTHING DID HAPPEN, YOU'VE GOT ALL THAT GOVERNMENT INSURANCE. THAT'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU AND THE BABY FOR A LONG WHILE. OH, WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT? NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN ANYHOW. TED... LOOK AT ME. THAT BABY AND I-- WE WON'T EVER NEED ANYTHING BUT YOU. WE MUSTN'T EITHER OF US BE SCARED ABOUT IT, TED, BECAUSE THE BABY-- THE BABY'S WHY I KNOW YOU'RE COMING BACK TO US. [CHEERING] WE'D BETTER MAKE THIS ONE, OR SHORTY WILL NEVER LET US HEAR THE LAST OF IT. YEAH. HEAR THOSE ENGINES? LIKE MUSIC.

AFTER YOU TAKE OFF THIS MORNING, YOU ARE TO SEE NO ONE, SPEAK TO NO ONE, TELEPHONE NO ONE, NOT EVEN YOUR WIFE. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS. CONTINUE YOUR GAS CONSUMPTION TEST TO YOUR DESTINATION. NOW, THE WORK YOU WILL BE ASKED TO DO WILL REQUIRE A LITTLE LOW-ALTITUDE FLYING, SO HEDGEHOPPING ON THIS TRIP IS PERFECTLY OK. ONLY BEAR IN MIND THAT COWBOYS WEAR PRETTY TALL HATS, SO WATCH YOUR STEP, MEN. THAT'S ALL. I... I THINK YOU'RE VERY WELL-PREPARED FOR WHAT YOU VOLUNTEERED TO DO, AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR A LOT OF GOOD HARD WORK. I'LL SEE YOU IN A FEW DAYS. GOOD LUCK. I hope I get a chance to tell Ellen good-bye. Yeah, you will. YOUR DESTINATION IS ALAMEDA FIELD. TAKE THE SOUTHERN ROUTE. REFUEL AT SAN ANTONIO AND MARCH. AS YOUR NAMES ARE CALLED, YOU CAN START. FIRST FLIGHT: HOLSTROM, JONES, LAWSON. SECOND FLIGHT... [AIRPLANE ENGINE STARTING] TED. WELL, THIS IS IT, HONEY. WE'RE OFF. HOW SOON? JUST GOT TIME TO PACK. WHERE'S MY B-4 BAG? IN THE CLOSET. I'LL GET IT. GOOD. SOCKS. SHIRTS. Ted: MY TIES IN THE CLOSET? YES. I HAVE THEM. GOOD. [GLASS SHATTERS] Ted: WOW! DON'T GO IN THERE IN YOUR BARE FEET. I BROKE A GLASS. ALL RIGHT. YOU FORGOT YOUR TOOTHBRUSH. OH, DOGGONE IT. HAVE WE GOT EVERYTHING? I THINK SO. SWELL. WELL... BE A GOOD GIRL. TAKE GOOD CARE OF THAT BABY. I WILL, TED. YOURSELF, TOO. OH, TED, I...I'M GOING TO WRITE YOU A LETTER EVERY DAY YOU'RE GONE. I KNOW THEY WON'T DELIVER THEM. I WON'T EVEN MAIL THEM, BUT I'M GOING TO WRITE JUST THE SAME. THAT WAY WE'LL KIND OF BE IN TOUCH. THAT WAY WE'LL FEEL CLOSE. SURE. GOOD-BYE. BYE, FLIER. TELL ME, HONEY, HOW COME YOU'RE SO CUTE? I HAD TO BE IF I WAS GOING TO GET SUCH A GOOD-LOOKING FELLA. I'LL BE BACK. [MOUTHING] [TRAIN WHISTLES] HEY! THE BAY BRIDGE-- IT'S OFF TO OUR RIGHT. THE BAY BRIDGE--IT'S OFF TO OUR RIGHT! McClure: THE BAY BRIDGE! HOW ABOUT FLYING UNDER IT? BUT WHY? SO I CAN GET SOME PICTURES-- YOU KNOW, SHOOTING UP AT THE SUPERSTRUCTURE. COME ON, LAWSON. YOU WANT TO? SURE, GO AHEAD, IF IT WILL MAKE HIM HAPPY. THANKS! Ted: I HOPE THERE ARE NO CABLES HANGING UNDER THAT SPAN. HERE WE GO! UH-OH. LET'S TAKE A TURN AND DO IT AGAIN. I FORGOT TO PUT FILM IN. WE'RE DUE AT THE FIELD. FORGET IT. AW, I MAY NEVER GET ANOTHER CRACK AT IT. Davenport: HEY, LOOK. McCLURE, TAKE A LOOK DOWN THERE. IT'S A CARRIER. Davenport: YEAH, AND LOOK AT HER DECK. B-25s. HOLY SMOKE. THEN THIS IS IT. KIND OF SMALL, ISN'T SHE? PILOT TO BOMBARDIER. PILOT TO GUNNER. PILOT TO GUNNER. THATCHER! THATCHER! IT'S DEAD AGAIN. WE'D BETTER REPORT IT TO DOOLITTLE WHEN WE GET IN. YEAH--THAT LEFT ENGINE ALONG WITH IT. STILL SEEM A LITTLE ROUGH TO YOU? I CAN'T TELL ANYMORE. IS EVERYTHING OK ON YOUR SHIP? WHY, UH... YES, SIR! YES, SIR! TAXI OVER TO THE EDGE OF THE CARRIER'S WHARF. THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU THERE. YES, SIR. THEY DON'T EVEN WAIT TILL A FELLA GETS OUT! ALL NAVY GUYS ARE COCKY. MILLER'S A NAVY GUY. WELL, MILLER ISN'T EXACTLY NAVY. HE'S A PILOT. HEY, SPIKE! SPIKE. SPIKE, WHAT'S THE MATTER? I PUT IN A BEEF ABOUT MY FUEL PUMP. DOOLITTLE TOLD ME TO TAKE HER TO THE HANGAR. THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING? NO. THERE'S NOTHING REALLY WRONG WITH THAT PLANE. IT'S THE BEST SHIP IN THIS SQUAD. BOY, THAT'S ROUGH. AND I NEARLY TOLD HIM ABOUT OUR INTERPHONE. YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN A COOKED GOOSE. I THINK, SIR, I'LL GO AND WATCH THOSE NAVY GUYS. THEY MIGHT BANG HER UP OR SOMETHING. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT? [WHISTLE] THEY'RE GONNA BREAK THE DUCK'S BACK, SURE. HOW DID WE GET IN THE CLUTCHES OF THESE NAVY GUYS, ANYHOW? [WHISTLE] BOY, THAT'S AN AWFUL BIG SHIP. YEAH. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HER. SO LONG, SPIKE. SO LONG, SPIKE. BE SEEING YOU, SPIKE. GOOD-BYE, FELLAS. LIEUTENANT LAWSON REPORTING ABOARD, SIR. BENINGER, TAKE LIEUTENANT LAWSON TO... 306, SIR. 306. THIS WAY, SIR. SEE YOU GUYS LATER. LIEUTENANT McCLURE REPORTING ABOARD, SIR. THESE ARE YOUR QUARTERS, SIR. MR. WHITE AND MR. FAULKNER ARE ON SHORE LEAVE. THANK YOU. ARE YOU SURE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND YOUR WAY BACK UP TO THE DECK, SIR? OH, SURE. THANKS. [WHISTLING] WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE? OH, JUST LOOKING AROUND. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? JUST LOOKING AROUND. HA HA HA HA! ARE YOU LOST, TOO? AM I LOST? I'M TRAPPED LIKE A RAT. I'VE BEEN WALKING FOR MILES. THIS IS THE BIGGEST COCKEYED SHIP I'VE EVER SEEN. YEAH, AND I WISH THE DECK WAS TWICE AS BIG. P.A.: THE SMOKING LAMP IS OUT. SMOKING LAMP IS OUT. SIR, "SMOKING LAMP IS OUT" MEANS NO SMOKING ANYWHERE ON THE SHIP. OK. WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE THEY'RE REFUELING, SIR. THEY'LL LET US KNOW WHEN THEY'RE THROUGH. HALT. WELL, YOU GUYS FINALLY GOT ON, HUH? YEAH. WE'VE JUST BEEN LOOKING THE TUB OVER. HOW ARE YOUR QUARTERS? PERFECT--NICE ROOM WITH TWO BUNKS AND A COT. A COT? HA! FOLLOW ME, BROTHERS. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU REAL QUARTERS-- AND I MEAN QUARTERS. HATS. HATS. [AHEM] WELL, WE HAVE GUESTS! WHAT'S THE IDEA OF BRINGING PEOPLE UP HERE FROM THE TENEMENT DISTRICT? [LAUGHTER] THIS IS JOCULARLY KNOWN AS THE ADMIRALS' CABIN. LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO START BATHING. THIS ISN'T ALL. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE. FOLLOW ME. WE'LL BE GLAD TO. OOPS. CAREFUL OF THE RUGS, PLEASE. NOW, JUST INSIDE, GENTLEMEN, IS SOMETHING TO REALLY FEAST YOUR PEEPERS ON. FIRST GUY TURNS IN AFTER DINNER GETS THIS BED FOR THE TRIP. HMM. YOU KNOW WHO THAT'LL BE. ENTER. WHAT DIRTY LOWLIFE... COME OUT OF THERE, YOU BOLL WEEVIL! WELL, FEED ME CORN AND WATCH ME CROW! HOW DID ALL THIS SCUM GET IN? AND ME IN AN ARMY COT. THAT'S WHERE HE'LL END UP BEFORE THE NIGHT'S OVER. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. OH, LIEUTENANT, WHEN YOU GUYS GO DOWN TO DINNER, WOULD YOU MIND BRINGING BACK A ROAST BEEF SANDWICH, RARE? AND A PIECE OF HUCKLEBERRY PIE, LIEUTENANT! HA HA! [FOGHORN BLOWS] WELL, YOU STILL GLAD YOU CAME ALONG? SURE. AREN'T YOU? I'VE GOT A FUNNY FEELING ABOUT THIS JOB. YEAH? UH-HUH. I THINK MAYBE IT ISN'T GOING TO BE AS MUCH OF A CINCH AS WE FIGURED ON. YEAH, I'VE BEEN THINKING THE SAME THING. WELL, MY SHIP'S OVER THERE. I THINK I'LL GO TAKE A LOOK AT HER. THE DUCK'S UP AHEAD. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. GOOD NIGHT. Lawson: GOOD NIGHT. WHO'S THAT? THAT YOU, THATCHER? OH, YES, SIR. OH, FORGET IT, THATCHER. GOT HER PRETTY WELL LASHED DOWN, HAVEN'T THEY? YES, SIR. THEY DID A GOOD JOB. I WAS KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT HER, SO I THOUGHT I'D BETTER COME UP AND HAVE A LOOK. YOU LONESOME? WHY, I GUESS EVERYBODY IS A LITTLE, SIR. DON'T BOTHER WITH THE SIRS, DAVE. QUARTERS ALL RIGHT? YEAH, FINE. GRUB'S GOOD, TOO, ISN'T IT? BEST I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME, SIR. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHEN WE GET BACK HOME, THATCHER? OH, I HAVE A GIRL IN BILLINGS, SIR. I'M GOING TO MARRY HER... IF WE GET BACK. OH, WE'LL GET BACK, ALL RIGHT. [FOOTSTEPS] OH, HELLO. HELLO. HELLO. I, UH...THOUGHT I'D COME UP AND SHOOT THE STARS FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I GUESS IT'S TOO FOGGY. PRETTY FOGGY, ALL RIGHT. [FOOTSTEPS] WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE? OH, JUST GETTING A LITTLE AIR. YEAH. IT'S PRETTY STUFFY DOWN BELOW. YEAH, IT SURE IS. YOU GUYS WORRY OVER THE RUPTURED DUCK LIKE A BUNCH OF OLD MAIDS. ME, I'M GOING TO BED. [WHISTLE BLOWS] GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, TED. WONDERFUL AIR, ISN'T IT? P.A.: THE SMOKING LAMP IS LIT. THE SMOKING LAMP IS LIT. [BUGLE SOUNDS] Man: HA HA HA! OH, WHAT HAPPENED? JUST BATTLE STATIONS. AROUND SUNUP AND SUNDOWN, THE PIGBOATS GIVE US A LITTLE TROUBLE, SO WE ALWAYS LAY FOR THEM. THIS IS JIG WHITE, AND I'M BUD FELTON. GLAD TO SEE YOU. GLAD TO SEE YOU. Lawson: HOW ARE YOU? SEE YOU LATER. ARE WE UNDERWAY? FOR THE LAST 5 HOURS. GLAD TO HAVE YOU ABOARD, ARMY. P.A.: GENERAL QUARTERS, MAN YOUR BATTLE STATIONS. ARMY PERSONNEL, MAN YOUR PLANES. THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET THAT THING OFF OF HERE IS WITH A CRANE. MAYBE SO, BUT WE KIND OF THINK WE CAN TAKE OFF ON OUR OWN POWER. HEY, WHERE'D THEY COME FROM? Felton: THAT'S WHAT'S KNOWN AS AN ESCORT. THEY JUST SLIPPED UP ON US DURING THE NIGHT. THE NAVY LIKES TO DO THINGS QUIETLY. LOOKS LIKE IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE A SHOW, DOESN'T IT? BOY, DID I HATE TO PART SKIN FROM SHEET THIS MORNING. WHAT A BED! HA HA HA! OH, THIS IS SHORTY MANCH. JIG WHITE AND BUD FELTON. HI, Y'ALL. HI, Y'ALL. THIS LUCKY STIFF IS SLEEPING IN THE BEDROOM OFF THE ADMIRAL'S CABIN. YEAH. WONDERFUL ACCOMMODATIONS BUT NOTHING MUCH TO DO. I THOUGHT THERE'D AT LEAST BE A POKER GAME OR SOMETHING GOING ON. I GUESS THEY HAVE THEM EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. HOW ABOUT 7-TOED PETE? DO YOU EVER PLAY MUCH OF THAT AROUND HERE? [WHISTLE BLOWS] WHAT'S 7-TOED PETE? WELL, IT'S A KIND OF 7-CARD POKER. I'D BE GLAD TO TEACH IT TO YOU SOMETIME. NEVER HEARD OF IT. P.A.: ATTENTION, ARMY PERSONNEL. ATTENTION, ARMY PERSONNEL. ASSEMBLE IN WARD ROOM. SEE YOU LATER, FELLAS. ASSEMBLE IN WARD ROOM. IT'S BEEN A GREAT PLEASURE, FELLAS. WE'LL CERTAINLY HAVE TO GET TOGETHER SOON. MAYBE WE CAN GET UP THAT LITTLE GAME OF POKER. SEE YOU LATER. YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE THAT BOY WANTS TO PLAY POKER. I WONDER IF THEY GOT THEIR PAY BEFORE THEY CAME ABOARD. Doolittle: AS YOU WERE. FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO HAVEN'T ALREADY GUESSED, WE'RE GOING STRAIGHT TO JAPAN. [MEN MURMUR] THE NAVY WILL TAKE US WITHIN 400 MILES OF THE JAPANESE MAINLAND. WE'RE GOING TO BOMB TOKYO, YOKOHAMA, KOBE, OSAKA, NAGOYA. IT WILL BE A NIGHT JOB, AND YOU WILL BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF CHOOSING THE CITY YOU PREFER. NOW, THIS IS GOING TO BE A TIGHT SQUEEZE. THE CHINESE HAVE PREPARED SMALL FIELDS JUST OUTSIDE OF JAPANESE OCCUPIED TERRITORY FOR US TO LAND ON AFTER THE RAID. THEY'LL GAS US UP, AND WE'LL TAKE OFF FOR CHONGQING. FROM NOW ON, WE'RE IN CONSTANT DANGER OF ENEMY ATTACK. IF THERE SHOULD BE A SURFACE ATTACK, STAND BY YOUR PLANES WITH FIRE EXTINGUISHERS AND LET THE NAVY HANDLE IT. IF THERE SHOULD BE AN ATTACK BY AIR, TAKE OFF AND MAKE FOR THE NEAREST LAND. THE NAVY WILL GIVE ALL NAVIGATORS THEIR BEARINGS TWICE A DAY. NOW, ONCE MORE, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IF ANY OF YOU FEEL YOU'RE NOT UP TO THIS JOB, IT'S PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT FOR YOU TO DROP OUT. WE HAVE A FEW SPARE MEN, AND I THINK WE CAN FILL YOUR PLACE. GET TOGETHER WITH CAPTAIN YORK AND FIND OUT WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR PLANES. WE'LL MEET HERE TOMORROW AFTERNOON AT 2:30. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS? COLONEL, DO YOU MIND IF WE SMOKE DURING THESE ASSEMBLIES? [LAUGHTER] I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THAT IF THE NAVY HASN'T. ANYTHING ELSE? DISMISSED. 48...49...50... 51...52...53...54... 55...56...57... OH, SORRY, MANCH. JUST GETTING A LITTLE EXERCISE. YEAH? WELL, I WASN'T. I'M MEASURING OFF THIS COCKEYED DECK. 90... P.A.: ATTENTION, ALL PERSONNEL. YOU HAVE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT THE MISSION WE ARE ON. I THINK YOU MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW THAT THE ARMY PERSONNEL ON THE HORNET ARE GOING TO BOMB JAPAN. WE IN THE NAVY ARE GOING TO TAKE THEM IN AS CLOSE TO THE ENEMY AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS A CHANCE FOR ALL OF US TO GIVE THE JAPS A DOSE OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE. IT'S AN ARMY-NAVY SHOW. LET'S EXTEND EVERY COURTESY TO THE ARMY MEN ON THE HORNET WHO ARE GOING TO DO THE JOB. GOOD LUCK, GOOD HUNTING, AND MAY GOD SPEED US ON OUR MISSION. HAVE SOME? THANKS, BUDDY! Manch: YOU'RE AWFULLY LUCKY FOR GUYS WHO NEVER HEARD OF 7-TOED PETE. THEY TELL ME VIRGINIA'S A GREAT HUNTING COUNTRY, TOO. WHAT'S THAT? OH, YEAH. LET'S PLAY, FELLAS. WHAT'S THE BET? IT'S UP TO YOU, MANCH. DON'T THEY CALL VIRGINIA THE MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS? UH...YEAH. I MEAN, UM...BET 5. UP 10. THOMAS JEFFERSON LIVED THERE, TOO, DIDN'T HE? I DROP. A LOT OF GUYS LIVED THERE. ARE YOU SURE YOU NEVER PLAYED 7-TOED PETE BEFORE? MAKES IT 10 TO YOU, MANCH. HAVE THEY FINALLY GOTTEN THAT HOOKWORM SITUATION UNDER CONTROL DOWN THERE? THERE NEVER HAS BEEN A CASE OF HOOKWORM IN VIRGINIA. I GOT A SMALL STRAIGHT. MINE'S 7 TO THE JACK. ALL PINK. WELL, THAT BEATS. I THINK I'LL TURN IN. SOMEBODY'S WON A LOT OF DOUGH. A LITTLE. YOU JUST HAD A RUN OF BAD CARDS, MANCH. YEAH. Felton: WHAT SAY WE GET TOGETHER AGAIN PRETTY SOON? OH, SURE. SEE YOU LATER. SAY, YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY BOOKS ON VIRGINIA, HAVE YOU, MANCH? YOU ARMY GUYS ARE REAL PIGEONS. I WISH YOU WERE IN THE NAVY. YOU TAKE THE BUNK, LAWSON. I'LL SLEEP HERE IF YOU DON'T MIND. WHAT'S THE IDEA? AH, THAT THING'S AS SOFT AS A FEATHER BED. I NEVER COULD SLEEP IN IT. YEAH, IT'S NOT BAD. THANKS. THANKS A LOT. Doolittle: LT. RANDALL IS GOING TO TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT A CARRIER TAKEOFF. MR. RANDALL. FROM THE MINUTE YOU'RE IN YOUR PLANES, I'M THE MAN TO WATCH. HAVE YOUR ENGINES TURNING OVER AS SOON AS THE MAN IN FRONT OF YOU STARTS TAXIING. WHEN I WANT YOU TO REV UP, I'LL GIVE YOU THIS. NOW, IF YOUR ENGINES DON'T SOUND RIGHT TO ME, I MAY HAVE TO KEEP YOU REVVED UP LONGER THAN YOU THINK NECESSARY. I CAN HEAR YOUR ENGINES AND TELL WHEN THEY'RE MISSING BETTER THAN YOU CAN. WHEN I WANT YOU TO START TAXIING, I'LL GIVE YOU THIS. NOW YOU'RE IN POSITION. I GIVE YOU A FINAL REV, AND WHEN I DROP IT... YOU'RE OFF. WE'LL AIM YOU STRAIGHT FOR JAPAN. ONE MORE THING. ONCE WE'RE LINED UP FOR THE TAKEOFFS, THERE CAN BE NO DELAYS. IF YOUR PLANE STALLS, IF IT DOESN'T START IMMEDIATELY, IF YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE OF ANY KIND, WE WON'T HAVE TIME TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THE NAVY CREW HAS ORDERS TO PUSH THE SHIP OVERBOARD, MAKE WAY FOR THE NEXT ONE. Doolittle: LIEUTENANT JURIKA HAS DETAILED MAPS AND PICTURES OF CITIES AND SPECIFIED TARGETS. MR. JURIKA SPENT A GREAT MANY YEARS IN JAPAN. I THINK IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA IF HE GAVE YOU SOME IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO RUN UP AGAINST IN CASE YOU'RE FORCED DOWN. MR. JURIKA. I WAS ASSISTANT NAVAL ATTACHE AT OUR EMBASSY IN JAPAN LONG ENOUGH TO LEARN A FEW THINGS ABOUT THE ORIENT. JUST WHAT SHOULD WE DO, MR. JURIKA? HOW SHOULD WE CONDUCT OURSELVES IN CASE WE ARE FORCED DOWN OVER JAPAN? MY ADVICE IS, SEE THAT YOU'RE NOT FORCED DOWN OVER JAPAN. THE RUN I'VE GOT FIGURED OUT FOR YOU STARTS HERE. THE SMOKESTACKS ARE BRIGHT RED BRICK, AND YOU CAN'T MISS THEM-- ONE OF THE LARGEST SMELTERS IN JAPAN. THEN FOLLOWING THE LINE OF THE BAY AND ALLOWING 10 SECONDS BETWEEN BOMBS, YOU SHOULD TAKE OUT THIS AND THIS. BOTH OF THEM ARE MACHINE SHOPS OWNED BY BROTHERS. I FORGET THEIR NAMES, BUT I REMEMBER I DIDN'T LIKE THEM. THEN ON OUT HERE TO DROP YOUR INCENDIARY. HOW DOES THIS LINE UP FOR YOU, LAWSON? WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THEM, CLEVER. THAT RUN SEEMS ALL RIGHT WITH ME IF IT'S OK FOR YOU. WE CAN TAKE THEM OUT. FINE. GEORGE, HAVE YOU GOT THE COURSE LAID OUT FOR THIS RUN? YES. OVER HERE, FELLAS. NOW, YOU TAKE OFF ABOUT HERE AND GO DUE WEST TO TOKYO AT MINIMUM CRUISING SPEED, FLYING AT ABOUT 50 FEET. WHEN YOU HIT THE BAY, GET UP TO 1,500, COMPLETE YOUR BOMBING RUN, THEN DOWN AGAIN AND OUT TO SEA, SOUTH BY SOUTHEAST TO YAKU SHIMA. Lawson: CAN WE TAKE THE MAPS WITH US? ALL YOU NEED. BE SURE THERE ARE NO MARKS ON THEM, THOUGH, WHICH MIGHT SHOW THE JAPS WHERE YOU CAME FROM IN CASE YOU'RE CAPTURED. BY THE WAY, I'M TAKING OFF FIRST WITH 4 INCENDIARIES. THAT SHOULD LIGHT UP TOKYO PRETTY WELL FOR YOU. SUPPOSE BY THE TIME WE GET TO CHINA, THE JAPS HAVE TAKEN OVER THE LANDING FIELD. THE CHINESE HAVE ARRANGED A SIGNAL FOR YOU WHEN YOU GET TO THE FIELD IF THE JAPS HAVE CAPTURED IT. IF THAT'S THE CASE, YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP RIGHT ON GOING UNTIL YOU RUN OUT OF GAS, THEN BAIL OUT AND DESTROY YOUR PLANES. [WHISPERING] YES. Jurika: THERE'S JUST BEEN A CHANGE IN THE DISPOSITION OF THE BARRAGE BALLOONS OVER TOKYO. THIS BALLOON AND THIS ONE WERE MOVED THIS MORNING TO HERE AND HERE. YOU KNOW, THE CHANGES IN THOSE BALLOONS THREW ME. JUST THINK, A BUNCH OF GUYS SWEATING ALL DAY IN A SUB DOWN IN THE TOKYO BAY, GUYS JUST LIKE US, SNEAKING UP AT NIGHT TO RADIO BALLOON POSITIONS. JUST LET ME HEAR ANYBODY TALK ABOUT THE NAVY AGAIN. BOY, THEY'RE GOOD. PLENTY. THEY'RE NOT BAD AT POKER, EITHER. OH, YOU'RE NOT KIDDING. I KIND OF FIGURED ON GETTING ELLEN A PRESENT IN CHONGQING, YOU KNOW, A KIMONO OR SOMETHING, BUT THESE NAVY GUYS HAVE CLEANED ME. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I'VE ONLY GOT 14 BUCKS. WELL, I GOT $8 OR $10 I COULD LET YOU HAVE. OH, NO, NO. I'VE BEEN THINKING, CIGARETTES SELL FOR 60 CENTS A CARTON ON THE BOAT HERE, BUT IN CHONGQING, I HEAR THE BOYS WILL PAY 7 BUCKS. YEAH? SO, I FIGURE I MAY LOAD THE DUCK WITH COFFIN NAILS. HEY, THAT'S AN IDEA. AH, IT'S A GOOD NIGHT FOR SUBS. YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY. WHEN I WAS A KID, I USED TO DREAM ABOUT GOING SOMEPLACE ON A SHIP. WELL, HERE I AM. AND OUT THERE IS JAPAN. MY MOTHER HAD A JAP GARDENER ONCE. HE SEEMED LIKE A NICE LITTLE GUY. WELL, I DON'T HATE JAPS...YET. IT'S A FUNNY THING. I...I DON'T LIKE THEM, BUT I DON'T HATE THEM. I GUESS I DON'T, EITHER. YOU GET KIND OF MIXED UP. YEAH. IT'S HARD TO FIGURE, YET HERE WE ARE. ALL I EVER WANTED TO BE WAS AN AERONAUTICAL ENGINEER. I JOINED THE ARMY IN '40 BECAUSE I FIGURED IT WAS THE BEST WAY TO LEARN. I WASN'T SORE AT ANYBODY. BUT HERE YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE YOU'RE GOING TO DROP A TON OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES ON ONE OF THE BIGGEST CITIES IN THE WORLD. YOU'RE NOT GETTING SQUEAMISH, ARE YOU? OH, NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT. I DON'T PRETEND TO LIKE THE IDEA OF KILLING A BUNCH OF PEOPLE, BUT IT'S A CASE OF DROP A BOMB ON THEM, OR PRETTY SOON, THEY'LL BE DROPPING ONE ON ELLEN. YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. I WONDER HOW MANY OF US WILL PULL THROUGH. OH, THEY FIGURE ABOUT HALF. AND EVERYBODY THINKS HE'LL BE IN THAT HALF. YEAH. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET MARRIED, BOB? OH, WHEN I FIND SOMEBODY LIKE ELLEN. BE SWELL, YOU KNOW, THE FOUR OF US. YOU KNOW, WHEN THIS IS OVER, I'D LIKE TO GET ME A SMALL RANCH, SOMETHING THAT WOULD RUN ABOUT... OH, 40, 50 HEAD OF CATTLE. NICE WELL AND A HOUSE. BE WONDERFUL FOR KIDS. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF NUTS ABOUT RANCHES MYSELF. YOU KNOW, IN A DECENT YEAR, YOU CAN MAKE REAL DOUGH OUT OF 40 HEAD OF CATTLE IF YOU GOT FEED. WHY DON'T WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT? WELL, I'M GAME IF YOU ARE. OK. IT'S A DEAL. GOOD. OF COURSE, NOW, IF WE HAD 80 HEAD OF CATTLE, WE'D REALLY HAVE OURSELVES A LAYOUT. YEAH, AND OUR OWN MEAT, TOO. OH, YEAH. MILK, BUTTER, EGGS--THE WHOLE WORKS. YOU KNOW, A GUY'S GOT HIMSELF A PLACE, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING. AND WITH A LITTLE HUNTING NEAR. OH, SURE. THAT'S EASY. GOSH, I'LL BE GLAD WHEN THIS WAR ENDS. Doolittle: IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY, THERE WILL BE NO ASSEMBLY, NO LAST-MINUTE INSTRUCTIONS. WE'LL JUST TAKE OFF. IF YOU SHOULD DEVELOP MOTOR TROUBLE WITHIN A HALF-HOUR AFTER LEAVING THE HORNET, FLY BACK TO THE SHIP AND LAND IN THE WATER. THE NAVY WILL TRY TO FISH YOU OUT. IF TROUBLE SHOULD DEVELOP AFTER THAT TIME, YOU'LL HAVE TO KEEP RIGHT ON GOING BECAUSE, BY THAT TIME, THE FLEET WILL HAVE TO FIRE ON ANY CRAFT OVERHEAD. I DON'T WANT YOU TO THROW OUT THE EXTRA CANS OF GAS AS YOU USE THEM. THAT WOULD LEAVE A PERFECT TRAIL FOR THE JAPS TO FOLLOW BACK TO THE HORNET. SAVE THE CANS AND THROW THEM ALL OUT AT ONE TIME. NOW LET ME REPEAT SOMETHING I'VE SAID PREVIOUSLY. YOU ARE TO BOMB THE MILITARY TARGETS ASSIGNED TO YOU AND NOTHING ELSE. OF COURSE, IN AN OPERATION OF THIS KIND, YOU CANNOT AVOID KILLING CIVILIANS BECAUSE WAR PLANTS ARE MANNED BY CIVILIANS. IF ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY MORAL FEELINGS ABOUT THIS NECESSARY KILLING, IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU MIGHT THINK OF YOURSELF AFTERWARD AS A MURDERER, I WANT YOU TO DROP OUT. WE'LL FIND SOMEONE TO TAKE YOUR PLACE, AND I PROMISE YOU THAT NO ONE WILL BLAME YOU FOR YOUR FEELINGS. BARRING ANY SUDDEN SWITCH IN PLANS, WE'LL TAKE OFF TOMORROW NIGHT. THERE'S ONE THING MORE. WHEN WE MEET IN CHONGQING, I'M GOING TO THROW YOU A PARTY THAT YOU CAN TELL YOUR GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT. YOU'RE A GREAT BUNCH OF GUYS. I'M PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH YOU. GOOD LUCK. 12 CARTONS OF CIGARETTES. 12 CARTONS? SAY, WHAT GIVES WITH THE ARMY? I NEVER SOLD SO MANY CIGARETTES IN MY LIFE. WE'RE CHAIN-SMOKERS. YOU MUST EAT THEM. WHAT KIND WILL IT BE? OH, ANY KIND. YOU JUST WANT LOTS OF CIGARETTES. YOU HIT IT RIGHT ON THE HEAD. ALL RIGHT. THAT'LL BE $7.20. [LARGE GUNS FIRING] [BUGLE SOUNDING] [KLAXON RINGING] P.A.: NOW HEAR THIS. OUR CARRIER TASK FORCE HAS BEEN SIGHTED BY ENEMY SURFACE VESSELS. ALL ARMY PILOTS AND CREWS, MAN YOUR PLANES FOR IMMEDIATE TAKEOFF. THERE GOES A JAP JUST 3 MINUTES AFTER WE SIGHTED HER. YEAH. THAT MEANS SHE HAD TWO MINUTES TO TELL TOKYO WHAT SHE SAW. P.A.: NOW HEAR THIS. GET ALL BOMBS LOADED ON THE DOUBLE. ARE YOU ALL PACKED? HAVE BEEN FOR 5 DAYS, SIR. GOOD. BETTER WATCH HOW THOSE GUYS HANDLE THE DUCK. I WILL, SIR. AND DON'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THAT BUM TURRET. I WON'T, SIR. HEY, WE'RE OFF, AREN'T WE? YEAH! OH, BOMB ME, DADDY, 8 TO THE BLOCK! AH, HA HA! I THINK I'VE GOT EVERYTHING PACKED. OH, SWELL. THANKS. I'M SORRY WE COULDN'T HAVE PICKED OUT A LITTLE BETTER WEATHER FOR YOU. WE'LL MAKE IT. SO LONG, FELTON. GIVE THEM A PASTING THEY'LL NEVER FORGET. WE WILL. LOOK, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING. YOU GUYS IN THE NAVY ARE... WELL, YOU'RE OK. BE SEEING YOU. [WHISTLE BLOWS] P.A.: NOW HEAR THIS. CLEAR THE FLIGHT DECK TO START ENGINES. MM MM! HEY, HOW ABOUT MY CHANGE? THEY'RE GIVING US 15 EXTRA CANS INSTEAD OF 10, SIR. GOOD! AT LEAST GETTING OFF NOW WILL PUT US OVER TOKYO IN DAYLIGHT. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE BARRAGE BALLOONS IN DAYLIGHT, TOO. NEXT, YOU'LL BE TELLING ME IT'S GOOD BECAUSE YOU GET BETTER PICTURES IN THE DAYTIME. YOU'RE NOT KIDDING ABOUT THAT, EITHER. LET'S GIVE HER A FINAL CHECK. HEY, BOB! WHAT? ARE YOU UP AHEAD? FOURTH SPOT. SEE YOU IN CHONGQING. YOU SAID IT, BROTHER! HOW THEY DOING? DOOLITTLE WILL BE OFF ANY SECOND. THEN HOOVER, HOLSTROM, GRAY, AND DAVEY JONES. WE'RE SEVENTH. 7's A LUCKY NUMBER. TED! TED! HEY, TED! TED! HEY! PUT THESE SOMEPLACE, WILL YOU? WHAT ARE THEY? SIZZLE PLATTERS. I GOT THE PHONOGRAPH IN MY SHIP, BUT I HAVEN'T GOT ROOM FOR THE RECORDS. WE'LL MEET IN CHONGQING AND CUT A CHINESE RUG! OK, SHORTY. TAKE CARE OF THESE, WILL YOU, McCLURE? McClure: RIGHT. PILOT TO GUNNER. Thatcher: GUNNER TO PILOT. GO AHEAD, SIR. TAKE A LOOK AT THE TURRET IF YOU GET A CHANCE. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT, SIR. SHE'S STILL JAMMED. WE'LL USE THE AUXILIARY POWER IF WE HAVE TO. RIGHT, SIR. WE'VE GOT OURSELVES IN A FINE JAM, HAVEN'T WE, LAWSON? THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO THINK OF THAT. OH, NO. I MEAN HAVING TO TAKE OFF AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. OH, I'M SORRY, DAVENPORT. I GUESS MAYBE I'M A LITTLE ON EDGE. BOMB BAY CLEAR? BOMB BAY CLEAR! CLEAR ON RIGHT? CLEAR ON RIGHT! CLEAR ON LEFT? CLEAR ON LEFT! [ENGINES REVVING] [MEN CHEERING] HE MADE IT! [CHEERING] GET YOUR FLAPS UP. HEY! GOOD LUCK, FELLAS! HAVE A COUPLE FOR THE NAVY! WE SURE WILL, MILLER. AND THANKS TO YOU. WISH I WERE GOING WITH YOU. SO LONG. BYE, BOYS. Davenport: 4 MORE AHEAD OF US. Lawson: LET'S START THE ENGINES. LET'S GO. CLEAR ON RIGHT? CLEAR ON RIGHT? CLEAR ON RIGHT! CLEAR ON LEFT? CLEAR ON LEFT! [ENGINE HESITATING] THOSE NAVY GUYS ARE MOVING UP TO PUSH US OVER. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TOSS THIS SHIP OVERBOARD. COME ON, BABY! GIVE! GIVE! GIVE! [ENGINE STARTS] HA HA! CHECK HYDRAULIC PRESSURE. HYDRAULIC PRESSURE OK. CHECK BRAKE PRESSURE. OK. THERE GOES BOB. TWO MORE AHEAD OF US. CHECK FUEL BOOSTER. HEY, ARMY! TED! GIVE 'EM... [ENGINE REVVING] ARMY! WHEN WE GET TO CHONGQING, WE'LL TELL THEM IT WAS A NAVY SHOW, TOO. THEY'LL KNOW THAT WHEN THEY SEE HOW BROKE YOU ARE! GOOD HUNTING! BOMB BAY DOORS CLOSED. Clever: BOMB BAY'S CLOSED. PILOT TO GUNNER. ALL SET, THATCHER? EVERYTHING OK, SIR. Lawson: WING FLAPS DOWN. WING FLAPS COMING DOWN. THERE GOES HALLMARK. WE'RE TAKING OFF, FELLAS. HAPPY LANDINGS. Davenport: WHEW. Lawson: YEAH. TUCK THE FLAPS UP. WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THEM DOWN. HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT? I WONDER WHAT ELSE WE FORGOT. COFFEE, SANDWICHES, WATER--PLENTY. PILOT TO GUNNER. THATCHER. GUNNER TO PILOT. GO AHEAD, SIR. YOU ALL RIGHT, THATCHER? YES, SIR. YOU'D BETTER GET STARTED ON THOSE CANS. WE'VE BURNED OVER 40 GALLONS ALREADY. YES, SIR. WELL, WE'RE ON OUR WAY. IF ANYBODY'S CARRYING A RABBIT'S FOOT, HANG ON TO IT TIGHT. WHAT'S OUR POSITION, McCLURE? I FIGURE ABOUT AN HOUR AND 58 MINUTES FROM THE COAST. GET THAT, THATCHER? WE CAN EXPECT THEIR FIGHTERS ANYTIME NOW. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN. WATCHING, SIR. THERE'S NOTHING IN SIGHT. COULD WE TRY OUT THIS TURRET AGAIN? OK. RELAY SWITCH ON. WORKS ALL RIGHT, SIR, BUT THAT EMERGENCY POWER'S NOT GOING TO HOLD OUT LONG IF WE RUN INTO TROUBLE. TURNING IT OFF NOW. HOW FAR ARE WE BEHIND OUR FIRST GANG? ABOUT AN HOUR. WE REALLY CAN GET SET FOR TROUBLE. YEAH, BUT NOTHING LIKE WHAT THE GUYS BEHIND US ARE GOING TO RUN INTO. I'D FEEL A LOT BETTER ON A NIGHT JOB. DID YOU HEAR THAT LEFT ENGINE MISS? NO. SINGING LIKE A LARK. I MUST BE HEARING THINGS. NAVIGATOR TO PILOT. PILOT TO NAVIGATOR. GO AHEAD. WE OUGHT TO HIT THE JAPANESE COAST ANY MINUTE. LOOK! Lawson: SEE THAT FLAG? Davenport: YEAH. SAVING BOMBS TODAY. THEY'RE WAVING AT US. THOSE GUYS MUST BE NUTS. JAPANESE COAST, STRAIGHT AHEAD. FUJIYAMA. WE'LL BE CATCHING BUCKSHOT ANY SECOND NOW. ZEROES! PILOT TO-- I SAW THEM, SIR. SHALL I TURN THE POWER ON FOR THE TURRET? NO. WAIT A MINUTE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM, SIR. I GUESS THEY DIDN'T SEE US. Lawson: THERE SHE IS, FELLAS. TAKE A GOOD GANDER. WHEN WE GET BACK HOME, THE FOLKS WILL WANT TO KNOW WHAT TOKYO USED TO LOOK LIKE. Davenport: THAT MUST BE DAVEY JONES GIVING THEM THE WORKS. PILOT TO BOMBARDIER, BOMB BAY DOORS OPEN. THERE WE ARE-- THE BIG RED SMOKESTACK. PILOT TO BOMBARDIER, APPROACHING SMELTER. I'M ON IT. [EXPLOSIONS] THEY'VE GOT OUR ALTITUDE. ONE AWAY. TWO AWAY. 3 AWAY. 4 AWAY. [EXPLOSION] SIX FIGHTERS JUST ABOVE AND TO THE RIGHT. HAVE YOU GOT THEM, THATCHER? Thatcher: READY FOR THEM, SIR. WHY DON'T THEY DIVE? Davenport: THEY'RE GOING AWAY. I'M NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR THEM TO COME BACK. WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE. WELL, I GUESS MAYBE WE'RE IN THAT LUCKY HALF. NOT YET. NOT TILL WE GET TO CHINA. WOW! WHAT A HEADACHE. WERE YOU SCARED? I'M STILL SCARED. Lawson: McCLURE, ON OUR COURSE? ON OUR COURSE. 160 GALLONS. I HOPE IT'S ENOUGH TO GET US TO CH'ANG-CHOU. YEAH, AND I HOPE THE JAPS DON'T GET THERE FIRST. WHAT'S THE DOPE, McCLURE?

THERE WERE A LOT OF PLANES, AND WE HAD TO TAKE OFF EARLY. YOU SEE HOW IT WAS. OF COURSE. THEY AREN'T IN ANY SHAPE TO MAKE MUCH OF A TRIP, DOCTOR. WE'LL HAVE TO MOVE THEM AT ONCE. THE JAPANESE CAPTURED ONE OF YOUR CREWS YESTERDAY NOT VERY FAR FROM HERE. SO MANY PLANES. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHERS.

[SPEAKING CHINESE] YOU WON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF, WILL YOU, DOC? WE HOPE NOT. ONE CANNOT TELL. YOU'VE HAD A LONG JOURNEY. NOW YOU MUST REST. ALL WE HAD AT OUR MISSION WAS A LITTLE ANTISEPTIC FLUID AND SOME BANDAGES, BUT WE'VE SENT OUT RUNNERS FOR SUPPLIES. IS THERE ANY WAY I COULD GET A MESSAGE OUT? I'D LIKE MY MOTHER TO KNOW THAT I'M OK. THE WHOLE REGION'S SWARMING WITH JAPANESE. DO YOU THINK THEY'VE HEARD BACK IN THE STATES WHAT HAPPENED TO US? WE'VE BEEN LISTENING ON THE SHORTWAVE. THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT THE RAID, BUT APPARENTLY THEY'RE KEEPING THE DETAILS SECRET UNTIL THE REST OF YOUR MEN HAVE BEEN SAVED. HAVE THEY FOUND ANY OF THE OTHERS? WE HAVE WORD THAT ONE CREW WILL BE COMING THROUGH HERE PRETTY SOON NOW. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A DOCTOR AMONG THEM. THEN IT MUST BE LIEUTENANT SMITH'S CREW. EXCUSE ME. LIEUTENANT SMITH'S CREW HAS BEEN RESCUED, SIR. SMITH'S? THEY FOUND LIEUTENANT SMITH AND DOC WHITE, AND THEY'RE COMING HERE. DON SMITH'S CREW? THE DOC WAS FLYING WITH DON SMITH.

THEY THINK I'M PASSED OUT HALF THE TIME, AND I HEAR WHAT THEY SAY. THE JAPS ARE COMING CLOSER ALL THE TIME. WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO? WE'RE NOT STICKING AROUND HERE BECAUSE OF YOU, LAWSON. NONE OF US HERE ARE ABLE TO TRAVEL YET. I WAS JUST THINKING... I GUESS ELLEN AND I AREN'T GOING TO SKI ANYMORE. THAT'S TOO BAD. I WAS GOING TO TEACH HER SOME FANCY STUFF. NOW, DON'T START TALKING LIKE THAT. YOU'RE GOING TO PULL THROUGH ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK A GIRL WOULD DO? I MEAN, SAY, ELLEN AND I LIKE TO SKI. BE KIND OF FUNNY IF THEY CUT MY LEG OFF, WOULDN'T IT? WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO GO TO SLEEP? YEAH, IT WOULD BE KIND OF FUNNY, ALL RIGHT. MARRY A GUY WHO'S GOT TWO ARMS AND TWO LEGS. THEN HE COMES BACK, AND HE HASN'T ANY. [PEOPLE TALKING EXCITEDLY] I'M DR. CHUNG. WHERE ARE THE BOYS? HOW ARE YOU, POP? DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TRIP? HERE THEY ARE. AH! DON, HOW YOU DOING? HELLO, SARGE.

REALLY LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING LEFT OVER FROM A MASSACRE. WELL, YOU GUYS DON'T LOOK SO GOOD YOURSELVES. McClure: YOU DON'T SMELL SO GOOD, EITHER. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH US THAT A GOOD BATH WON'T FIX. I WISH WE COULD SAY THE SAME FOR YOU. HOW'S THE GRUB AROUND HERE? I THINK I'D LIKE A GOOD, THICK STEAK, FRENCH-FRIED ONIONS, AND A BAKED POTATO WITH PLENTY OF BUTTER, AND ABOUT 3 BOTTLES OF BEER, AND-- YOU'LL TAKE BEAN SPROUTS AND LIKE THEM. SAY, WHERE'S LAWSON AND DAVENPORT? THEY'RE UPSTAIRS. LAWSON'S IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE. YOU BETTER GO UP AND SEE HIM. HE NEEDS YOU BAD, DOC. WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY GOOD TO SEE YOU FELLAS AGAIN. HEY, POP! HOW'S THE CHOP SUEY AROUND HERE? [SPEAKING CHINESE] Clever: HE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. OH! WELL, I'M SORRY, POP. [LAUGHTER] YEAH. AND WHEN SHORTY JUMPED, HE HAD TWO .45s, A .44 RIFLE, A .22 AUTOMATIC, THAT LUGER OF HIS, A HUNTING KNIFE, A BOWIE KNIFE, AND AN AX. WHAT A GUY. HA HA! HE STUFFED HIS SHIRT FULL OF CHOCOLATE BARS, BUT HE FORGOT TO BUTTON HIS COLLAR, SO WHEN HE PULLED THE RIP CORD, HE JUST NATURALLY MOLTED CANDY ALL OVER NORTH CHINA. WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS PHONOGRAPH? IT WENT DOWN WITH THE SHIP. NEXT MORNING, MANCH SCARED THE CHINESE RIGHT OUT OF THEIR WITS. THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING HUMAN GREW THAT TALL. WHAT ABOUT BOB GRAY? HE'S OK. I THINK THEY MOVED ON TO CHONGQING. OH, YEAH, AND THAT GUY, "ME CHARLIE," SAID TO TELL YOU HELLO. IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR CHARLIE, THE JAPS WOULD HAVE HAD US THAT FIRST DAY. YEAH. US, TOO. I'D LIKE TO COME BACK SOMEDAY AND FIGHT ALONGSIDE THAT GUY. ME, TOO. IT'S ALL OVER. LET'S SAVE SOME OF THIS TALK FOR TOMORROW, HUH? PINT AND A HALF-- THAT'S NOT BAD. YOU BETTER GET TO BED NOW. AW, YOU'RE AN OLD GRANDMA, DOC... BUT I'LL TAKE IT SLOW JUST AS A FAVOR TO YOU. BE SEEING YOU, LAWSON. THANKS, DON. HOW'S THE LEG, DOC? IT'S NOT GOOD, LAWSON. THE NEXT 48 HOURS WILL TELL THE STORY. THANK YOU. Davenport: HEY, DON! YEAH? TELL DOOLITTLE TO HOLD OFF THAT PARTY TILL WE GET THERE. OK, DAVENPORT. WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU. WHERE'S THATCHER? HE'S IN WITH LAWSON. HE'LL BE RIGHT OUT. OK. I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME STAY HERE UNTIL YOU'RE READY TO GO, SIR. THESE PEOPLE WILL TAKE CARE OF US. THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU FELLAS TO HANG AROUND AND MAYBE GET CAUGHT. YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I MIGHT COME IN HANDY IF THE JAPS SHOW UP, SIR. THATCHER, WHEN YOU GET BACK TO THE STATES, IF YOU SHOULD RUN INTO MY WIFE, JUST TELL HER I'M OK. DON'T LET HER KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING BEING WRONG. I UNDERSTAND, SIR. AND SAY HELLO FOR ME TO THAT GIRL IN BILLINGS. THAT I WILL, SIR. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE, THATCHER. * THE STARS AT NIGHT ARE BIG AND BRIGHT * * DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS * * THE PRAIRIE SKY IS WIDE AND HIGH * * DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS * * THE SAGE IN BLOOM IS LIKE PERFUME * * DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS * GOOD MORNING.

WE TALKED IT OVER, AND THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO DO. OH. IT'S PRETTY ROUGH TO HAVE TO CUT A MAN'S LEG OFF. I GUESS IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT. AFTER ALL, A WOODEN LEG IS JUST KIND OF LIKE WEARING A SHOE WITH A HIGH INSTEP. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT? I MIGHT AS WELL GIVE YOU A SHOT RIGHT NOW. YOU MEAN WE HAVE SOMETHING TO KNOCK ME OUT? OUR RUNNERS ARRIVED WITH ANESTHETIC THIS MORNING. IT'LL ONLY BE A SPINAL, LAWSON. YOU WON'T FEEL ANYTHING FROM THE WAIST DOWN, BUT YOU'LL BE CONSCIOUS. THAT'S THE BEST WE CAN DO. OH, SWELL. I CAN WATCH YOU AND MAKE SURE YOU DON'T TAKE OFF TOO MUCH. ALL RIGHT, LAWSON. WE'LL HAVE TO ROLL YOU OVER. IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO WORK. WE'LL GET YOU OVER TO THE OPERATING ROOM.

WHEN THAT ANESTHETIC WEARS OFF, WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY MORE. OK, BUT JUST ONE THING MORE. YES. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, DON'T LET ELLEN KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE OPERATION. SHE MIGHT JUST AS WELL THINK I DIED ALL IN ONE PIECE. ALL RIGHT, LAWSON. NOW, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL THIS, BUT--WELL, YOU MIGHT GET NERVOUS AND JUMP OR SOMETHING, SO THE NURSES ARE GOING TO HOLD YOU. OK, DOC. FIRE AWAY. [SPEAKING CHINESE] OH! WHEN YOU SAID NO KNEE, YOU WEREN'T KIDDING. IF I CUT ANY LOWER, WE MIGHT HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN. YOUR SYSTEM COULDN'T TAKE IT. WHAT ARE YOU STALLING FOR, DOC? WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN, LAWSON. TAKE IT EASY. OK, ONLY HURRY. IT SEEMS LIKE I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL MY OTHER LEG. SEEMS LIKE I CAN MOVE MY TOES, DOC! I THINK I CAN MOVE MY ANKLE. HURRY, DOC. I'M SURE I CAN. HURRY, DOC! HURRY!

DO YOU THINK TED'S GOING TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO WHAT KIND OF CLOTHES YOU WEAR OR HOW YOU LOOK? HE ALWAYS DID. OH, MOTHER, I'M SCARED. THERE'S NOTHING TO BE FRIGHTENED ABOUT. LOTS OF PEOPLE LOSE A LEG OR ARM AND CONTINUE LIVING PERFECTLY NORMAL LIVES. I'M NOT SCARED ABOUT TED. I'M SCARED ABOUT ME. ABOUT YOU? WELL, YOU SEE, MOST HUSBANDS AND WIVES ARE TOGETHER WHILE THINGS ARE CHANGING, AND HUSBANDS GET USED TO THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE, WELL, THEY'RE AROUND. TED'S BEEN GONE ALL THIS TIME, AND WHEN HE WENT AWAY I WAS SO SLIM, AND ALL THE TIME HE'S BEEN GONE HE'S BEEN THINKING OF ME LIKE THAT. TED LOVES YOU, ELLEN, AND YOU LOVE HIM. THAT'S WHY NEITHER OF YOU IS GOING TO NOTICE ANY CHANGE WHEN YOU MEET HIM. DO YOU THINK SO, MOTHER? I KNOW SO.

WELL, I WON'T BE MUCH USE TO ANYBODY WITH A-- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? DO YOU THINK WE'D LET A MAN OF YOUR EXPERIENCE GET AWAY FROM US? WELL, THAT'S FINE, SIR. THANK YOU. DON'T THANK ME. I JUST HAPPENED TO THINK OF SOMETHING, LAWSON. YES, SIR? WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE? DOES SHE KNOW YOU'RE BACK? NO, SIR. WHY NOT? WELL, I THOUGHT I'D WAIT TILL I GET MY NEW LEG AND... MY SCARS FIXED UP. IT WON'T BE SO MUCH OF A SHOCK TO HER THAT WAY. SHOCK? WHAT KIND OF A GIRL DID YOU MARRY, ANYWAY? SHE'S OK, SIR. SHE'S A FINE GIRL. WELL, THEN SHE DESERVES TO KNOW. SHE DESERVES TO SEE YOU, TOO. NO.

WHEN I SEE ELLEN AGAIN, I'M GOING TO BE ALL DRESSED UP AND HAVE A NEW LEG, AND I'M GOING TO TAKE HER OUT TO THE BEST PLACE IN TOWN, AND I'M GOING TO DANCE WITH HER. THAT MAY BE QUITE A WHILE, LAWSON. NO, SIR. YOU SEE, I'M GETTING ALONG FINE. IN A MONTH OR TWO-- IN A MONTH OR TWO, YOU'LL BE BACK AT WORK--HARD WORK. WELL, I'LL TRY TO DROP IN ON YOU AGAIN, LAWSON. I HOPE YOU CAN, SIR. BYE. GOOD-BYE, SIR. YOUR WIFE'S GOING TO HAVE A BABY, ISN'T SHE? YES, SIR. I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF KIDS MYSELF-- BOTH IN THE SERVICE. YOU KNOW, LAWSON, IF MY KIDS AND ALL THE OTHER KIDS WHO WERE IN THIS THING COULD... COULD FIX IT SO THIS WOULD REALLY BE THE LAST ONE, YOUR KID WOULD GET QUITE A BREAK, WOULDN'T HE? HE SURE WOULD, SIR. I...I JUST HAD TO COME. TED, TED, TED! LET ME HELP YOU. NO, NO. YOU'LL HURT THE BABY. WHEN THINGS WERE WORST, WHEN THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY CHANCE AT ALL, I COULD SEE YOUR FACE-- YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE. I KNEW YOU WERE COMING HOME, TED. TELL ME, HONEY. HOW COME YOU'RE SO CUTE? I HAD TO BE IF I WAS GOING TO GET SUCH A GOOD-LOOKING FELLA. CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS. CAPTIONED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE
