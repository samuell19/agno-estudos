(Thunder) (Upbeat Music) we'll take it from here (Dramatic Music) i see you are up. we were hoping you'd sleep a bit longer where am i? this is pleasant hill hospital you don't remember coming here last night? no the last thing i remember was was falling asleep at general hospital let's not worry about that my dear doctor specter will explain it also dr spector you'll meet him later but here's dr spector he's in charge of the hospital he's your doctor dr nolan is my doctor did he bring me here last night? i don't have that information well then can you tell me who does because there's been some mistake i have no idea what's happened i'd like you to call dr nolan for me i can't understand how something like this could possibly happen and i know dr nolan wouldn't permit such a thing i guess hospitals just aren't as organized as they're supposed to be i'd like you to call dr nolan for me so i could get this whole thing straightened miss martin your doctor sent you to this hospital because he is confident that dr specter can bring you back to health what are you talking about i don't know any dr spector i don't know him i don't know you and furthermore you can't keep me here you must speak only when us to do so dr spector is a great man but not a weak one this hospital is under strict rules disobedience of those rules will be dealt with severely i'm going to see doctrine you're sorry to do this let go peace and quiet you must think of the other patients a few more hours restless martin and you'll be fine and then dr spector will be able to see you let go no no no no don't do that i want to be darker all right my oh so oh really now miss martin you're gonna have to stop all this yelling and screaming you'll disturb the other patients why aren't those people out there hear me people there's no one out there miss martin don't tell me that i know they're not there now but they were a minute ago well let's not worry about it besides we can't have you looking like this in front of the others i want to see dr spector well i'm afraid dr spectre is out for the evening but i'm sure he'll see you first thing in the morning come on now freshen up a bit and i'll take you down to dinner i'm not hungry why have i been locked in my room i want to know why i've been lost in my room i believe you'll find a brush in the door there's a woman who came in here earlier she locked me in my room or you must mean martine she's dr spector's assistant doesn't make a very good impression well you'll get used to it she was just following instructions oh that's much better come on i have to put my shoes on first your table's over there you're new here aren't you yes forgive my friends we don't often have new people eat with us they always seem to sit at the other tables do you know who those people are at the other table i don't know i've never been close enough to them to find out do you suppose i wish you could speak toward the devil it must be frustrating how long have you been here i came here a few weeks ago the other two were here before me he's been here longer than any of us dr spector says that he'll be able to restore my sight very soon dr spector is really a very remarkable man when he even promised me that i would walk out of here i've been confined to this chair for 20 years i've seen every major specialist in the country when i first heard of dr spector had given up but he offered me such hope do you believe it because i saw a miracle call it what you want but if there's a chance we have to take it what do you know about these people over there nothing we don't ask it's simpler that way what is our doctor spectre going to do for you that's become the joke of the day because i don't even know dr specter and yet suddenly i'm told i'm this patient it's very confusing because well the last thing i remember was going to sleep with general hospital the next thing i knew i woke up in this thing don't worry dr spector knows what's best for you you just do as he says and everything will be fine why are we sure to fool me on those people only given an age there's one thing you'll have to learn and that is not to question anything that is done around here you mind your business and your mind there believe me it's the best way i'm sorry but i just can't accept things the way you do i mean i don't even know why i'm here so i can hardly afford to run my own business good uh graham huh uh you know you shouldn't leave a general people like that we were wondering where you went the food isn't that bad now unless you want to brew we'll go back to the dining room i heard voices in there come on all right now it's um now ready for basic morning 4. okay hello angie yeah this is chris i got you as soon as i could have you been seen who seen you today transfer where to why would dr nolan transfer to another hospital what well you have any idea how to get there yes this please have a seat that's perspective we'll be right in i ring for you a pleasure to meet you at last miss martin i've enjoyed your concert thank you welcome to pleasant hill are you comfortable well doctor i've been trying to tell everyone i said there's been a very serious mistake now for one thing i don't understand there'll be time for all your questions later may i offer you some water no thank you dr nolan and i have discussed your case in great depth your breakdown was a minor one dr nolan never mentioned anything to me is that a breakdown it gave me the impression that all i needed was a little rest that's why i went to the hospital in the first place i'm sorry but i'm sure dr nolan has never mentioned your name to me no i didn't want to alarm you he thought that i might uh explain that but there's nothing to explain look doctor i was living a perfectly normal life and then suddenly for no reason that makes any sense to me i find myself in this place among strange people experiencing terrifying things nightmares you've been shocked by a sudden change of environment you'll overcome it and in no time at all you'll be back resuming your career you know miss martin i'm a great admirer of yours i've attended as many of your concerts as my time and work would allow doctor if you don't mind i didn't sleep very much last night and i'm very tired now the only thing i want to hear about or discuss is my immediate release sit down please forgive me i'm tired work long past two make ours i would like to know what you intend to do about this doctor i do have a right to know of course but i have to examine you before discussing your condition examine me doctor there's nothing wrong with me i told you that before i'm perfectly normal let me tell you something if i could survive the last few hours and keep my sanity i know nothing is wrong examination is purely routine miss martin but we can't help you without all right now if you remove your clothing and wrap this sheet around you i'll be back in a moment nice your back is ready my dear i don't like my dad huh dr spector ordered a hot pot i do think we should follow his instructions how long do i stay in not long just what is required come on you think that's hot enough i'll wash your back for you that's okay i can do it no i'll help you ah the skin is lovely and smarter so soft so white almost as if it were unblemished by sin so i was beginning to wonder if there was anyone here may i help you sir yes it's uh sunday you know visiting hours i'm here to see lucina martin well i'm afraid we don't have visiting hours at this hospital not on sundays or any other day if you care to make an appointment what are you talking about there's nothing else hey now wait a minute damn it you're going to answer a few questions for me before you start slamming doors in my face now is lucina here i ask you a question perhaps i could help you young man who are you i'm dr spector director of the hospital maybe you can your friend here says that you don't have visiting hours now what kind of a hospital is it that doesn't have visiting what did you wish to see my fiance lucina martin i see mr um uh dunk chris duncan mr duncan it's not that we don't have visiting hours here at pleasant hill it's just that this is an asylum and some of our patients are easily disturbed i gave instructions that no one was allowed to see the senior at this time because why not well i thought it would be better for lucini if her treatment was not interrupted at this stage you wouldn't want her to have a relapse would you relapse a relapse from what there's nothing wrong with her don't you think that decision is best left to her doctor or if you'll excuse me i'll get back to my patients hey laughs i have to see him problem here why wasn't i allowed to be quick i'll call you if i need you please sit down listen doctor i've got to know why i wasn't allowed to see chris i thought it was better at this time let you not have any reminder of the outside world for the moment at least the treatment we have you on might not be effective if we clutter it up with memories we have to keep thinking of tomorrow don't we but when will chris be back what did he say anything he's very understanding he's said to tell you he sends his love and i told him to keep in touch with me and i tell him when you could receive visitors when will that be talking if you're good it was your toll that should be soon but you must cooperate with me we're both wasting our time i want to release you as much as you want to go now go to your own and don't worry mr duncan is most anxious that you cooperate with us he knows we're doing everything for your good dr nolan and mr chris duncan is here to see you please sit down mr duncan i'm sorry to ask c without an appointment doctor but i feel this is an urgent math urgent matter i just found out that lucine has been transferred to another hospital now i had no idea she was that serious and after my visit to that uh asylum yesterday well i'm really very concerned asylum there's nothing really wrong with lucinia except that she's overworked i told her a year ago she should slow down perhaps even take a short vacation she seemed to think that was out of the question but an asylum surely you must be mistaken i'm not mistaken doctor she's in some place called a pleasant hill and i don't know why and she was perfectly healthy when we came back from the mountains last week but now suddenly she's in this uh at pleasant hill asylum or sanitarium or whatever the hell it is and i don't understand it this is this dr specter that you've called in on the case that wasn't my decision unfortunately actually i've not met the man the day after i brought lucinia into the hospital i got a telegram instructing us to transfer her to pleasant hill for special treatment who sent that telegraph her father we don't usually do things like this but he called the following day insisting that his instructions be followed to the letter he was so insistent i really had no choice he said that all arrangements had been made and she should be transferred right away i'm sure it was her fault yes why do you ask because doctor her father died when she was 12 years old are you sure her father's dead she never told me but then she's only been under my care a short while i'm absolutely positive now what do you know about dr spec not much i'm afraid his name appeared a few times in the medical journal several years ago if i'm not mistaken he established an excellent reputation in the physiology of pain and pain reflexes particularly in the biochemical reaction of pain in the central nervous system he wrote several articles and impressed a great many doctors or how long ago was this oh about 10 15 years ago at least but i could find out i know no that's not necessary have you heard anything about him or his work since then no i don't remember hearing anything lately he seemed to have disappeared i thought perhaps he had retired from the medical profession to be perfectly frank i was shocked myself when i saw his name on the telegram he was in his 70s when those articles appeared 70. that's impossible now i'm sure he was in his 70s when he was working on the pain experiment could there be two specs because the man i saw yesterday could have been more than 45 yet from what you say he'd have to be at least 80 years old all i know is what i've told you that still leaves me with a lot of unanswered questions and but thank you anyway i wish i could have been more helpful to you i understand please keep me informed i'll do all that i can to help right dr spector said this would be my final treatment i waited so long for this day what do you think hey huh nice yes i'll do what i can yes ma'am i understand yes yes ma'am soon i get a chance to come back i quote that do what i can oh yeah yeah okay bye bye yes yes ma'am um i'm looking for detective walsh i'm walsh i'm chris duncan i think i'm here to report a kidnapping all right mr duncan who's been kidnapped well i i'm not certain she's been kidnapped wait wait wait who is she lucinia martin spell senior l-u-c-i-n-a girlfriend uh beyonce all right you're not sure she's been kidnapped but but what well it's just kind of hard to explain i i don't really know where to start how about the beginning okay all right have you ever heard of a place called a pleasant hill hospital pleasant hill no well the senior was admitted there a few days ago but but they don't allow anyone to see it so what's so strange about that look lots of times they won't let a patient have visitors and you say she was admitted so how do you get a kidnap charge out of that forget it mr duncan unless you have more facts than you've already given me i don't have a reason to even begin an investigation there are more facts there's a hell of a lot more facts there's something wrong with that whole damn place you feel it the minute you enter the gates you feel it surely you don't expect us to go out here and raid a place simply because someone has a strange feeling about come on mr duncan we'd be raiding every church and funeral parlor in town if we use that philosophy look all i'm asking you to do is to come out there with me and take a look for yourself somehow i just don't think your damn time's that valuable look you don't come into my office telling me how to run all right i'll take you out to your pleasant hill i want you to see just how ridiculous you really look i don't believe it when did you say you were here last i was here yesterday and this gate was open looks to me like it hasn't been open in 20 years you know duncan you said you had a strange feeling now i have one i have a strange feeling you want to play haunted house look you're this spot you may as well walk to the top of the hill yesterday you know what i think i think this is the land of odds and you're the wizard and what a day first you now this ring i suppose this place was all neat and trapped yesterday oh what do you think i do always just run from town to town lying to you cops i was wondering about that yesterday this place was alive with people i swear it you know when i write my book you're going to be chapter one come on i've seen enough i'm not going to i see dr spector you know your trouble that you've seen too many specters already you want to see your phantom doctor you walk back to town ain't nobody going inside the door you live this place been called for years can we go now no no this man is dr spector sure sure he is name's falling been the caretaker here for years ain't no dr spencer around here though your fellas better get what are you talking about your name is dr spector you run this hospital now where's lucinia mr you're wrong this year ain't no hospital look he claims his fiancee was admitted to this hospital house to the patient or you can see mr ain't been nobody here for years well this is going to look great on my report visited a haunted house looking for a doctor named specter come on where have you seen what have you done with it you'll have to come downtown if you want to find a farmer anybody here before take care of him myself be uh yes i'll see you in the morning my dear do um uh operator operator hello operator oh god please answer didn't you sleep well right the stairs more patience more rooms they were up there last night that's impossible my dear i checked on you several times you were sleeping loudly i remember organs dr specter they were all there you must have been dreaming there's no dead body on the third floor i promise it was your imagination you've been very tense since you've arrived here you know miss martin if you don't get some rest that expected can't help you relax my dear you're working yourself up over nothing hmm so about three more steps the hang rail yes thank you i'll be right back after you're swimming period all right but don't be gone too long i'm a bit tired today are you there who's there you know i don't like to play games please so so duncan that old man didn't come in to fire a flight so there's no sense of me holding any longer it's awful damn nice to you you don't believe me at all about that place dear look i know what i saw and it's not what you said it was anyway there's nothing i can do without some kind of evidence to back up your story look i don't mind trying to help people out because it's my job but taking everything into consideration there's no way i can justify any action to myself or my boss so unless you have something more positive oh walsh you're the true public servant you know there are three elements about this case that confuse me you come to me with a hospital i can't find and a doctor that nobody knows and a kidnapped girl who doesn't exist go get aladdin's lamp and make your three wishes come true then we can talk until hello tom walsh look i want you to do me a favor you saw the kid i just like gold that yeah duncan yeah yeah sounds like you read my report look i don't think there's anything to the story he gave me right no i mean there's it doesn't hold water but the kids are dancing i want to find out something you know just my own curiosity how about running a routine check for me will you yeah just find out just the particulars right you've got it at pleasant hill yeah no i was completely deserted yeah i know it i know how would i know before i got there yeah in the doctor yeah but jason spector yeah no i never heard of him either but look don't spend any time on it just a routine check will you see what you come up with let me know where he is okay okay bye thanks miss martin doctor i understand you had a rather rough night last night nothing uncommon and nothing to worry about actually i feel you've made remarkable progress i'm confident that with a little self-discipline you'll be just fine so i decided that after this last treatment this evening i'm going to turn you over to dr nolan's care does that mean i can leave tomorrow morning well if you respond to the treatment as well as i feel you will i see no reason why you can't leave in the morning what um kind of treatment did you have in mind doctor nothing complicated i've uh called mr duck and he'll be here to reassure you yes he called earlier today and uh i told him what time he'd come by and pick you up in the morning so you can look forward to resuming your musical career you know i'd much rather see you in front of an orchestra than in front of my desk however you must promise not to push yourself good i'll see you tonight then you will mr so foreign foreign is that enough proof what the hell is it at the hospital now is that enough evidence god is that enough evidence not if your doctor died 20 years ago what do you mean you've been doing some checking on your dr spectre he was picked up several times for devil worshiping couldn't prove anything on that but he was suspected of murder oh god one of the victims found in the doctor's office what happened to her that's one of those unanswered questions he was never brought to trial he died before they caught him die you don't suppose there could be any connection between the picture and that i don't know oh you mentioned devil worshiping yeah but we can't go around arresting people for that nowadays but i'm not asking for an arrest all i want you to do is search that place all right we have to wait till morning get a search warranty wake up the judge or whoever it is in this town that makes out search warrants and you get it tonight specter spalding or whatever he calls himself could kill the senior before morning let's go you're about to meet again master i have kept our pact
