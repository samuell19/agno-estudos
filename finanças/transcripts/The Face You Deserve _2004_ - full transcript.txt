UP TO YOUR 30'S YOU HAVE THE FACE GOD HAS GIVEN YOU AFTER THAT YOU GET THE FACE YOU DESERVE Someone phoned... Yes... Francisco. Just a second. Carlos! Carlos! Sorry, Francisco. I can't talk now. Got to hang up. Sorry... What's going on in here?! I hate Carnival, Christmas, Easter, Summer holidays, New Year's Eve... Listen, who answered my phone call? At Ma??s beach, our sunburnt noses, Blue sandals for the stingbull fish Trying to open our eyes underwater, 8 years old and unable to swim. Where is that shit anyway? We're almost in Tibet... Who the hell had the idea to throw a party in a museum?! And havving to catch the bus... Damn it. Can't you see, Marta? Today was a special day. I'm getting wet! Army boots, tight trousers, spiky bracelets Sex Pistols and Ramones, but that didn't even last a week New Year, you are a nice kid again, new wishes over 12 raisins At 15, the champagne... and a kiss... - THE FACE YOU DESERVE - I've such a headache. I can't stand Lisbon anymore! We'll leave tomorrow after lunch. The hell with all of this! We have to put up with them in class. During the holidays too?! Why didn't I choose to be a public servant? Paris, Rome, Berlin, doing the inter-rail at 21 Expelled from the orchestra at 23 26, idle for life, it seems 28, and wearing a tie. I get paid to teach music. The clef... do, re, mi... whatever. I'm moving house, I've got better things to do, Marta! Why don't you say something, Marta? Francisco, you're 29 and miles away from the NASDAQ You're neither a football player nor did you discover a new vaccine and... and... You wake up with very scruffy hair. Francisco! Happy birthday. Go on, give us a kiss... My birthday is only at 6 pm. First Part THEATRE After sweeping the whole house, Snow White was very tired and decided to go and lie down in one of the little beds in the attic. But here come the owners of the house. ; the seven dwarfs. Heigh-Ho! Heigh-Ho! It's home from work we go! But the door is open and the lights are on! Ol?! Maths wasn't like this in my time... - Happy birthday, Francisco. - Only at 6 pm. Are the children coming home? Oh, but they are little dwarfs... If only the rain would stop, the kids could go and play outside and we could play cards. Teacher, have you marked our exams yet? Dear me! Do I know you? Go watch the play. - Teacher Francisco, Jo?o... - Carlos. Carlos told me you have an apple. - Negative, Jesus. - I had left one over there... A bite? Don't tell me you are jealous of the kid, Francisco? Yeah, yeah... I'm going to give you this apple... The apple is missing! ...which will fulfill your wishes. The apple is missing! I wish, I wish I marry the prince. What a wicked witch! Silence... So you don't like theatre either? I'll be back in a moment. - I'll join you. - To the toilet? Is it a poo or a pee? How old are you? Vera, sweet Vera... Don't be shy. Enjoy my company! Every minute counts. How will you possibly bear my absence? Next week I'll be far from Lisbon recovering from yesterday's hangover. The weather should be nice... I always swim against the current! I'd never spend Carnival in Madeira. The seven dwarfs wept for days for Snow White was dead. Yes, mother... Yes, I have the keys, they were in the drawer. Why phone Marta if you've phoned me and I've told you already I have them? I'm working! Why are you calling me to talk about those things? Yes! My clothes have been washed and I am taking the vitamin C with me! Mother, I'm going now. Bye. Mother... Snow White lies dead. My princess is dead! But a kiss could break the spell. My prince! Alive! Alive! Snow White is alive! They married and lived happily ever after. And now let's sing our song... Cowboy!! One, two, three... Heigh-Ho! Heigh-Ho! It's home from work we go! Heigh-Ho! Heigh-Ho! It's home from work we go! Heigh-Ho! Heigh-Ho! It's home from work we go! What happened to the cowboy? Maybe he's dead. He's not dead. He's pretending... How are you doing? You always argue back to me when I ask you to see a doctor... - Go on, say it then: "I told you so." - I told you so. - Last week you already... - That was different. Go on, be strong. It will all be over in no time. And tomorrow we're in the countryside. Doing I'm not sure what. Watching the stormy weather through the window... But tonight I'll let you keep your spurs on. It's the old age... Yes, of course. - Would you like a present now? - Ok. Open it. - What am I supposed to do with this? - Well... you play with it. It's only the first. There's more to come for our boy. Clothes... Come on, Francisco! I see you're fine again. Let's go. - I'm nine. - You're ten? I'm ten. - You're ten? I'm ten. Calling number... Ten! Water! Teacher! Teacher! Carlos! Carlos! Shut up!! What happened to you?! I'm going to take the kid to the hospital and I'll call you later. Fuck! It's my birthday. And I'm going in the school bus?! Francisco, stop being childish! What am I supposed to do? Have you seen the kid's chin?! Would you rather come with me, is it? Oh, I can't. Don't even mention it or I'll faint. Take my wings off. Kids nowadays are real savages. They watch too many cartoons... Hurry! When will you leave the hospital? Maybe we should cancel the dinner. Francisco, it's only 5 o'clock! I'm going to the hospital and I'll phone you later. Do you want me to come with you, teacher? No, thanks. The teacher is a bit tense, Carlos. Will you give me a ride, honey? Fucking freak... Francisco! Francisco, come inside! Where shall I drop you? Hey?! You're so serious. It was only a birthday kiss... Francisco?! Hands off, Francisco! Don't be such a sissy. Get up! This is your face inside. You're lucky. You're fine. But I feel ill. And I have hiccups. You've survived then? Are you silly? I've got 5 stitches. Doesn't sound like a joke... Are you listening? - How many did you get? - Four. See? Teacher Marta, will you buy me an ice cream? You can't eat ice creams for a few days. What about chocolates? You were a very good boy. When your parents arrive, I'm sure they'll buy you whatever you want. Ok. Vera had to leave. She sent kisses for you to get better. Francisco, I hate to spoil the surprise, but... You're supposed to have a party in the new house in half an hour. Cancel it. I'm not in the mood. Are you sure? Did you cry? Look! Thank you very much. A good afternoon and we hope you get better soon. Good afternoon. - Bye, Marta. - Bye. He'll be all deformed and full of scars... Francisco! It's my mother! You answer. Stop being childish and answer the phone! - I can't. I feel ill. - Ok. Give me that. Hello... Yes, it looks like it... Do you have your vaccine record book with you? To hell with the vaccines!! Are you feeling well? The bells are ringing. What is that supposed to mean?! I'm falling apart, I'm breaking down, I'm dying. See?! It's him again. Francisco, he's thirteen. I'll talk to him later in school. - This is getting too much! - Francisco, stop it! Listen, kid. Don't you think you're too young to be such a weirdo?! Just what I needed... Why are you following us? It's a free country. Francisco! Stop it! Let's go home! Carlos! Free my ass! Carlos! Let me go, you brute! You prefer to go with him, it that it?! Francisco, you're sick! Carlos! You've just called Marta. Please make it fast. Please answer the phone Turn on the sonotone Do you know what the time is? How much longer will you be? What am I supposed to do?

Oh, dear he slipped on the pavement Need to watch out Carlos gone straight to the floor And I am worrying Worrying about the pavement I should hang up now You must be here soon Ok, it was my fault then I would tell you I'm sorry, darling And I know you love me However bad I am, darling La fiesta! Let's begin First number. Twenty-four, two four. Fifty-four, five four. Thirty-five, three five. Eleven, number eleven. Forty-nine, four nine. Seventy-one, seven one. Forty-two, four two. Sixty-three, six three. Line announced. - FAGGOT - One more beer. I'm afraid not. We're closing. It's my brithday. Fuck!! 30, you sneeze and you cough You grumble and you yell You greak your head A broken face Francisco, be strong You are sick. Fuck... Mirror, mirror on the wall Who's the most beautiful of them all? Part Two MEASLES Thirty... I am sick, so I must stay in bed. I can't get up, otherwise I would start to sneeze. I can't stand up on my feet, or the house will spin around. I can't speak, or I'll start to cough. Here comes Nicolau! NICOLAU IS A SWEET BOY AND IS ALWAYS DAYDREAMING You shall never speak my name or I'll wake up at the sound of it. My name is the first word on the list of the 100 forbidden words The other ninety-nine words are just as important as that one So they must be memorised And never mentioned This is the list of rules to be memorised by everyone. The one who dares to challenge them will suffer the consequences. - Aren't you playing, Harry? - I am... You're dead, Harry! HARRY LOOKS LIKE A GENTLEMAN BUT HE IS VERY SECRETIVE. Now it's us catching him. GRASSHOPPER EPIDEMIC It's all against all. You will feed me four times a day and give me pills for me to sleep until I recover. You can never mix the big yellow pills with the small yellow pills (though it's obvious everyone wishes to do it). For example, even though some people dream about it you can never mix the dark blue pills and the soft blue pills, which melt in the hand when you hold them for too long, nor, for that matter, the green ones with the cream ones, nor the lilac ones with the white ones nor cream, pearl nor whatever. The red ones have to be taken in the right amount. - Sim?es, you're dead! - Travassos pushed me! Abort game! This is the list of rules. It is forbidden to read books without pictures and with small print. It is forbidden to tell secrets. It is (most of the time) forbidden to accept presents from strangers. It is forbidden to eat fish and vegetables, (which are disgusting things as everyone knows) It is forbidden to turn the lights off to those who are in the toilet. It is forbidden to count footsteps. It is forbidden to pretend to be feverish to avoid washing the dishes. GROSS IS ALWAYS HUNGRY AND NEVER STOPS EATING I am sick. You are seven to take care of me. You must think like this. ; He is himself, we are ouselves. We are seven to get him nice and healthy. C?pi! Travassos! Go away! This place is mine! There's enough room for two, C?pi. Go away, stupid! Go away or I'll scream! Shhh! Shhh! Be quiet! Someone is coming... The list of rules is to be followed but some things are allowed. It is allowed to climb the trees to steal eggs. It is also allowed to look through keyholes, to throw stones into the river and count the times they jump, to startle others or to collect flowers and to cut off the tails of lizards or other species from the fields... These and other things are possible. Only some are not. You're dead, Gross! Now it's us catching him. Open the door! Let me out! Open the door! - You're dead, C?pi! - Travassos locked me inside. C?PI ONLY THINKS ABOUT ROMANCE AND FORGETS HIS HOMEWORK When he is cold we must put an extra blanket, when he is hot we must take it off, if he is hungry we will give him soup, when he sneezes we will sweep the floor. I am dead sick at the moment but you are seven to take care of me. Apart from the rules, you can spend your time playing but if you break any rule, you will suffer the consequences. This is the list of rules. ; It is forbidden to set fire to the haystacks. If you go into my room, hold your breath or you'll wake me up. TRAVASSOS MAY BE ALL ALONE BUT HE NEVER LOSES HIS PRIDE I am sick. Repeat after me. He is sick. We are seven to take care of him. Me, the patient... Him, Francisc... C'mon boys! Don't say it! You surely mean. ; him, the patient... should have ab-so-lu-te rest! Surrounded by red sheets, red lights, red curtains, red candles, red washing bowls, generally red everything. Apart from the dark room... Watch out, Nicolau, it's the door on your left! Apart from the dark room, where there aren't any candles or bulbs, in which a terrible monster lives and where nobody is allowed in, all the other rooms should be lit up even when the electrics have gone off. It is normal to be afraid of the dark, Only one can go up to my room where I'm recovering from my sickness. - Catch me if you can! - Texas! TEXAS IS THE YOUNGEST AND YET SO LOYAL We can't play without trying to cheat. You may cross your fingers when lying hidden behind your back. If you see weird things on the mirror... - Catch Texas! - Abort game! Travassos cheated! You're dead, Travassos! One, two, three! Texas saves all! One, two, three! Texas saves all! Down in Arizona everyone was naked Down in Arizona everyone was naked Some had a peacock feather in the hand Some had a turkey feather in the... C?pi pushed me! Abort game! Travassos washes the dishes. If you're left standing, you wash the dishes. SIM?ES SPEAKS LOUD TO MAKE SURE HE'S RIGHT The loser in the game of chairs will wash the dishes of that day I am sick. You are seven to take care of me. He is himself. We are ourselves. We are seven to take care of him. Light. - What's this, Sim?es? - Don't touch it. It's the key to the dark room. Pay attention! This is the most important rule. ; Never can anyone be out of bed when the clock strikes 12. Anyone who disobeys will be forever doomed. To keep track of the hours, you shall oil the clocks'clogs. Friends. It's time for good sleep. Good night. - Good night, Sim?es. - Good night, Sim?es. Do you hear me? - Good night, Sim?es. - Good night. - A domani, Tex. - Good night, C?pi. - Good night, Texas. - Good night, C?pi. - Bye, Harry. - Bye, Texas. Bye, Harry. Bye, everyone. Bye, everyone. - Good night, Harry. - Good night, Travassos. - Good night, Harry. - Sweet dream, Gross. - Sweet dreams, Harry. - Good night. Nicolau, a good night sleep. Gross, a good night sleep you too. Well done, lads. Let light be separated from darkness. Let there be a morning and an evening. Let's begin. FIRST DAY Travassos thinks. ; Once upon a time there was a little duck. All the other ducks in the lake used to make fun of him because he was different. They called him the little ugly duckling. Come on, C?pi. I said I was first! I am! - I am first! - I am first! You didn't say you were first! I did! I didn't hear! I'm first! I'm first! I'm first! I shoot first! Don't point the rifle at me, C?pi! - I'll blast you! - You shouldn't play with guns! - Did you load the rifle? - No. Me neither. Give me that! No! Give me the rifle! I shoot first! If you didn't load it, it won't fire! I'm first! I'm sorry... Be careful, Harry! If only you cared more about yourself and less about others... I care about everyone. Et pluribus unum. Sim?es thinks. ; If I don't care, who will? You, Harry? Travassos, go and brush your hair. You probably think you'll be here forever, Sim?es... I think I have a solution. Sit down. Don't you dare, Nicolau! The tablets are not sweets. They are pills for our patient. Thrills?! Do you want me to take the rifle off them? Let me see in the light... And how do you feel? I feel a ball of fire growing inside of me. If you take one of these and a yellow one... Or is it the blue one? Little, little fairy... Turn this tooth into a coin. Right now I think he is sleepwalking... Nonsense. He is just sleeping with his eyes open. If he's dreaming of standing still... then he just stands still, doesn't he? Or if he's dreaming that he's asleep... or that he's sitting down... Nonsense. Sleepwalkers walk and do other things, they move their eyes and stuff. But some people sleep with their eyes open, just like Nicolau is doing now. If he's only asleep, then I can wake him up... No! If you're not sure... C?pi! Let's go out for a shoot? Later, Texas. Am?lia likes it really thick and deep. Armando could hardly believe when... Texas! We have to go this way! But, Sim?es... I'm almost sure it's that way. You're ALMOST sure... I have a feeling we have to... And when we get lost, you'll have a feeling we will be lost. Sim?es! It's a mushroom! It's a good one, isn't it? Come on, Texas, it's getting late. We can't leave the others alone. Another five minutes and we'll be in the warmth of the fire. It tickles... I have a watch now. - What time is it? - Nine! What do you think, Harry? Shall we start eating or what? Don't look at me like that, you can think for yourselves. Sim?es, you were the last one. You're doing the dishes tonight. Who told you that you could eat before everybody else? I'm not the only one. Who told you that you could eat? Harry said... Don't make things up, Travassos. What took you so long? Sim?es thinks. ; I took the wrong way... Texas... I took the wrong way. And what dismay the other ducks felt when realising that the ugly duckling had become a handsome and noble white swan... Texas, tell that individual that I'll not speak to him again. Unless he apologises for his behaviour. Travassos, Sim?es is saying he won't speak to you until you apologise. I shall not eat with you again. I'm leaving. - Stay... - Don't be silly. Don't go. Texas, tell that person that whining and blackmail won't move us. Travassos, Sim?es says that whining... - Travassos! - Travassos! - What did you say? - Whining and blackmail... Whining and blackmail!! Little, little fairy... If I take one cherry every night... No. Two every night... Nobody will notice. Nicolau, don't open that door! Move away! - Sim?es, you've got cherries with you... - Hell?! Open your hand, Nicolau. Nicolau, you're asleep. Go to bed. Go to bed. SECOND DAY Go on. Look what you did! But you didn't miss... You're right. But how are we going to get up there? - Gross, I'm going home. - Ok. Shake it! Bird falling! - Texas! Gross tokk away the ladder... - Gross! The ladder! Shut up! Now you stay right there. I'm calling Sim?es. We're even. And if any of you opens his mouth, I'll break his face and wipe him out. Do you think we'd get hurt if we jumped? Probably. Don't you think it's better to wait for Sim?es? He'll be angry. He might even take the rifle off us. Tex, I'm afraid... We'll count to ten and then I'll jump. If you don't see me moving, don't jump. One... Two... Texas, you're my best friend. There are no secrets between us. Promise you won't get hurt leaving me alone. I promise, C?pi. Don't be afraid. I promise I won't get hurt leaving you alone. Unconsciousness. Disorder. Chaos. By putting yourselves at risk, you're putting us all at risk. Including... you know who. We are seven to look after him. Shall I repeat the rules? Even simpler than that. Who lives in the trees? Say it. Who lives in the trees? The little sparrows... - What? - The birds... And do you have wings, I wonder? Monkeys also go up trees. And you? Do you have a tail and sharp claws? But even animals learn from mistakes. I hope that you can at least do that. I expected better from you, Texas. I want to eat. This is not the kind of thing you keep at home. Say a number, Harry. Laughing to yourself? Stories... - Tell me, tell me. - It's a silly story. The other day I was... well, I was by the river just hanging about, I was throwing something in the water that would float and follow the stream... Some leaves for silkworms... No. They were not leaves for silkworms. - Wild flowers, I reckon... - No, C?pi, they were not wild flowers. You've not been wasting chocolate biscuits, have you?! Shut up, C?pi! Or I won't tell you any more. Tell me, please... Harry, do you see those boats? It seems odd. They scare me. Let's throw stones at them to prevent them from getting near the house releasing armies of grasshoppers that would eat us all. You're so daft! No, you are! Now I understand, they were boats... You must have that sty seen. I suffer from that too. You can keep the coin, it's a proven medicine. You can give it back to me when you're better. Where did you get this? It's curious... On that day a sky of lead anticipated a heavy storm. I looked for shelter in the forest. The sea?! In the forest? That's what Sim?es said, C?pi. Let's take the treasure to Sim?es. He'll know what to do. Although I think that... Let's take the treasure to HARRY. He'll know what to do. Bless you. Next, before taking the treasure, they waited for the rain to stop. That's when I heard Gross talking about this bizarre event... Nicolau, the other day I forgot to put bacon on my sandwich... Stop! You won't start another story... without telling me the end of this one. How did Gross and Nicolau ended up? What happened to the treasure? It takes some patience to listen to stories, C?pi. Otherwise we would only tell the beginning and the end. It is, however, in the middle of a story that... The treasure, Harry... - Lift it! - Take it! Now the treasure has become the decoration of a fishpond. - Better the ark falling than me... - Right on! We better not tell Sim?es about this... Nor Haaarry... Haaammpshire... Hooobsbawm! And so, Gross was saying that... Having finally remembered about this bacon rasher I had left in the fridge for my scrumptious sandwich, to replenish my energy before axing wooden logs, I decided to go back when I was already on my way to the forest. Am?lia is very naughty. C?pi, let's go for a shoot out? She likes it really thick and deep. Later, Texas. Gross, do you see that cloud? If the rifle had a great deal of pressure, do you think I could shoot a hole in that cloud and see the blue of the sky through it? I'm not sure. I don't think so. Gross, your story reminds me of a dream I had... one of these nights. Goodbye, my friends. What are you doing here at this time of night? I could ask you the same. Don't you know what the time is? You'll break the rule. It's midnight. Close your eyes. Don't open your eyes no matter what. Travassos... Texas... Nicolau... Texas... Travassos... Nicolau... Wake up. Wake up, Texas. - What do you want? - Don't treat me badly. Everyone treats me badly. If you're not treated nicely it's because you're not a good guy, always stuck in the bathroom, always sneaking... What do you want? That's disgusting! Leave it. See this coin? It's a magic coin. If anyone knew I have it, I'd be in deep trouble. Then why are you giving me this? Sim?es was unfair to you as he was to me. I want you to trust me like you trust the others. If you don't find out that one of your friends is hiding something from you, that you don't know him that well, you can turn me in and give them the coin. Otherwise, you keep the coin and it becomes ours. You obey Sim?es' orders but you can't see that he's jealous of you because you're younger, stronger, prettier... I shall never eat at the table with you again. I'm not apologising to anyone. But, Travassos... The coin allows me to turn invisible and steal cookies from the can without anyone seeing? - Yes. - Cool! And to fly over the mountain, to command the winds, to guess other people's thoughts and... To catch liars like you, Travassos?! Whose filthy magazine is this?! C?pi?! - It's Travassos'! I think... - Liar! - I think it belongs to Travassos. - It's yours! Keep out! Travassos! C?pi! To whom does it belong, damn you?! Texas... It's mine. It's mine. I see you! - I'm not eating the white ones. - I'm not eating any. T... E... X... Tex! Aren't you eating, Texas? You're behaving like the other one? - And you too, Nicolau? - I don't like soup. - DON'T EAT THE SOUP - If you don't like it, have less. Food shouldn't be wasted. I could have something else... Travassos could have the soup. If Travassos wants to eat he'll apologise and sit at the table. It won't last, anyway. Texas, you have been eating biscuits before dinner... You're not supposed to eat so fast. What the hell is going on?! THRID DAY I will never have a bath again. Never again. Do you understand? Flowers for the patient. Eat up, Tex. It was prepared with only one hand... It's not raining. It's perfect to go shooting. - I don't feel like it. - Breakfast or shooting? I don't feel like it, C?pi. What's this spell, my friend? - Magic... - Give me that, C?pi! Go away! I'll never have a bath again. But why won't you wash your face at least? So that nobody forgets. It's just that you stink a bit... I won't have a bath. I won't. - Maybe if you were in command... - But I don't want to be in command... Have you ever imagined the world without anything? I mean really nothing. Without things, without people, without houses, nor trees... Like the desert? Yes, but without sand. And the blue of the sky... It gets dark like the sky at night. But without stars. And take away the darkness. There is no darkness... All is white? No white, no colours... There's nothing to see nor time to see. Damn! That is messing with my brain... Isn't it great?! Sim?es! Sim?es! Texas is giving food to Travassos! C?pi! Don't let him go! - Go, Travassos! - Silence! Go, C?pi! - Run, Travassos! - Silence! Catch him, C?pi! I'm very sad. I thought you were the most loyal. You were my best friend... You broke my heart! Nothing will ever be the same again. You're bad! Bad! The cat ate your tongue, you scum bag? Your silence is not worthy of our pity. You'll pay for it. Comrads! This fool is not worthy of our trust and is putting our mission at risk. What is our mission, Texas? Speak up, traitor! - To care for the patient... - And we were seven to do it. To accept him back in sharing our table and beds, he must execute horrid tasks. Any suggestions, anyone? I say he should spend the nights awake covering us with our bed covers and when Summer somes, let him shake plums as if we were Pharaohs. Make him eat bean stew every day. I like bean stew... - Let him memorise the whole Bible. - No. Those tasks take too long... And the Bible contains forbidden words. More like this... being locked up in a dark place, only lit up by a candle so close to his face that a sneeze would leave him in the dark... Or spending the weekend in the wolves' den... Or stealing eggs from the kites of the mountain... Or diving in the river and counting to a thousand under the water. Smoking a whole pack of cigarettes. Drenched in petrol. We'll break his little arms and legs. Pull out his teeth to make a necklace. Scalp him. Burn his eyelashes... You shall cross blindfolded the path of the cascades. This is your first mission. If you give up, you'll be sleeping in the dark room. If you cheat, we'll throw you down the cliff. If you succeed, at the end of the path we'll remove the blindfold. The wind blows strong and it knows the ways... The wind says. ; Follow my blow, don't walk against me. Take three steps to the left, seventy-three forward, Twelve to the right and you'll find support. The tree is great and it knows the ways. The tree says. ; Take ninety-nine steps forward. But take one of my arms so I can touch things ahead of you. Listen carefully to the brook. It flows and it knows the ways. The brook says. ; At each twentieth step, dip your hand in the water to make sure you are still with me. Listen to me. Trust me. No one except me can help you. You must count every single hair of everyone in the house. If you give up, you'll be sleeping in the dark room. If you don't manage to finish counting them by sunset, you must resume counting them at sunrise again every day, every month and years to come, for as long as it takes. This is your second mission, Texas. 2000. 4000. 6000. 6001... 6002... It's a louse! The right answer is. ; two hundred and thirty four billions. What?! You speak, louse?! How many single hairs has Nicolau? Answer or I'll crush you! The right answer is. ; two hundred and thirty four billions. Listen, have you been by any chance in the head of... Let me see... Sim?es? You or one of your cousins? The right answer is. ; a hundred and eighty three millions. Well done, louse! Let's be friends. Now count mine. Wait a minute... Can that be true, louse? Or you want to trick me? Who can defy this number? You must be smart, Texas... - Sim?es is fuming... - And Texas is fuming... He has all the dishes to wash... Washing the dishes is better than counting single hairs. But this is not the end of it. We have to get to the bottom of it... - Are you referring to Sim?es' tasks? - I'm talking about everything. Sim?es and Texas... Travassos' disappearance... How scary! If he's not back when the clock strikes midnight... But how do you think this will end, Harry? Badly. - How badly? - Just as badly as it has to be. Give us a bad thought. Let me see... Centipedes coming out of the sink? For example. Another one... Rats inside the chest of drawers? How lovely. Another one... Grasshoppers jumping out of the central heating? What a mess... - There are huge centipedes! - Rats in the drawers! Sabotage! Disgusting grasshoppers! And footprints near the dark room! Footprints? Marks left by boots. - It's the monster! - Monsters don't wear boots. Harry, I had another bad thought... YOU SCOUNNDRELLS. I'M NEEVER GOINNG TO LIKEE YOU AGGAIN. I'M NEVER COMINNG HOMME AGGAIN. YOULL NEVVER SEE ME AGGAIN. I HOPPE MONNSTER WIILL EATT YOU ALLL AT MIDNIGHT. TRAVACCOS ? THIRD NIGHT We're still alive. We have been spared. Such merciful action requires the harsh punishment of Travassos. God, let it be morning soon so that all the mess can be put right... Now, I'd really fancy a cherry! The list of the 100 forbidden words... The list of the 100 forbidden words... Otorhinolaryngologist... Otorhinolaryngologist... Shit... Francisco... Francisco... It's forbidden to count still or shooting stars. It's forbidden to count steps or tell secrets. It's forbidden to accept presents from strangers. What a hard on. No wonder! With such a pair of melons... How can the others stand these voices? Shut up, voice! I don't want to hear you anymore... Shut up! Shut up! Shut... Once upon a time there was a little duck. All the other ducks made fun of him because he was different. They called him the ugly duckling... The oven door is open and the fire is on... Pans with boiling water... Ajar of lard, small packets of butter out of the fridge... Travassos is inside! Travassos! I can see the water overflowing the bath... - He's in the bathroom. - Who will go there? I can see the toothpaste and the toothbrush inside Mickey's cup... Nicolau, I think we got it... I can hear the hairdryer... Travassos killed Sim?es. It's a set up; traps all over the house. This is the end, my fellow companions. - Goodbye, Harry. - Bye, C?pi. - Bye, Gross. - Bye, Texas. Boys... this is getting on my nerves. What next? I can see the precarious balance of the bottles... Hold it... Steady! I can see the precarious balance of the bottles... Keep going! Damn you! I can see the fallen plaster over the table under the chandelier... Go on! What else? I can see feathers flying in the hennery... Chicken food with nitro-glycerine... That coward won't even spare the little animals. Go on, you punk! Inside but outside the house. Cupboards and chairs. What else? Inside but outside the house. Spiders and centipedes. - What's the time, C?pi? - Nine o'clock. It's the hut! Where else could that creepy insect hide? Texas, listen... This will be your third and last mission. You must enter the hut before us and tell him... Stop right there! Travassos, don't worry. It's me, Texas. I still have the magic coin you gave me. They've punished me but the coin helped me through. Where are the others? They are waiting outside. They sent me ahead to tell you something. What have you got to tell me? It was me who broke your rubber duck. Now I can't find the coin... Gross! Don't let him get away! You won't wake him up doing that. Enough! Poor Texas... Let's take him to the room. Go on, boys! Are you messing with the furniture, Nicolau?! I'm glad you see it too. I thought it was only me... Are you trying to fool us, you clown?! I haven't done anything! Another one down. Wake up, junkie! Leave him, you fool! Can't you see he hasn't done anything? - Is that so?! Then who was it?! You? - No. So, was it C?pi? Was it me? Or maybe the cat? - No, it was Franc... - Shut up!! I'm afraid, Harry... Case closed. Can't you see me in the mirror, C?pi? There's no man in the mirror... There's no man in the mirror... There is a man in the mirror! There is a man in the mirror! Tex! You're fine already?! What are you doing, Texas?! My name is not Texas. We have to save Texas! Don't even think about it! Let's go inside and shoot the monster before he eats Texas... No one is going inside! - Harry! Let's go you and me! - It's too late. Shut up, you stupid! It's over! What time is it, C?pi? Is it still 9 o'clock? Nicolau! Go down and do some crosswords! I'm going to hide this key where no one will find it. Here I come, Texas. It's tied to something. If the monster is smart enough to follow the rope, we're in trouble. Here he comes, I've told you not to go in, Nicolau! - Do not go in, Nicolau! - Don't wake him up! I'm not Nicolau. This is not going well. If I had kept the key always with me... And if you hadn't given that mission to Texas... If we'd kept an eye on Travassos. If only you had straighten things out with him... I'm a loser... Let's not exaggerate. Thank you, Harry. You're most generous... No one can say we haven't taken good care of our man... He is feeling much better. He's already repeating dessert. Poor fellow... - No extra blanket for him anymore. - The fever has dropped. Nicolau told me he's almost finished with the antibiotic. - Sim?es... - Texas?! No. It wasn't Texas. - Harry... - Nicolau! You must go to the dark room, Sim?es. If you want to make him better. It's time to go in, Harry This is all going to end. Sim?es, do you want him to get well or not? Are you here? You must go in, Harry. You knew this moment would come. I'm afraid, Nicolau. Be brave, Harry. Something wrong, Harry? - I'm alright. And you? - I'm fine. Harry, this is the moment you've been waiting for. You cannot go back now. Be brave, Harry. But I'm afraid of the dark! Stop, voice of the demon! The rule forbids me to go in. Why would he need you, if he is getting well? You must face the monster and take Harry with you. I want to but I can't, Nicolau. Even if I could, what about Sim?es? I've been thinking: The house is so empty... There's so little to do... Right! Maybe it's not such a bad idea... To go inside the dark room. Fine. Really?! I'm very pleased. You first. Do you think I'm stupid?! Go in right now! Don't push me. I'm afraid of the dark. - Ready or not, I'll make you go! - Try your luck! Pax... Pax... Do you see those pills? The first to go down is pushed inside the dark room. If it's you, case closed. If it's me, you'll be so stoned that the dark... Shall we take them with a glass of cherry? Oh, Harry... Magnificent, old chap! Leave, Travassos. Hide in the forest. Go away! Now! But what am I supposed to do? Here all alone? Gross... Fairy, little fairy, Turn this tooth into a coin. Gross, follow the path of the golden coins. Gross! Gross! FRANCISCO, SHALL I LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON? Goodbye, my friends.
