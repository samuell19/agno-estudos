[NOTIFICATION SOUND] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SIREN NOISE] [TRAFFIC NOISE] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [NOTIFICATION SOUND] - I really like you, is there a way for me to get you back? I mean not in a weird way, just. - If I'm in your area and I'm on and I'm the closest one to you, that's kind of how it works is it just requests the closest driver to you. - So I can't just like call you, have special code. Like uh- - No I don't have like a referral code that I can give out. - That is so disappointing 'cause I was thinking about calling you tomorrow morning to get my car which I have no idea where it's at actually. - Oh you need to get back to your car, I see. Yeah, no I'm probably gonna drive pretty late tonight and then I won't really be on tomorrow until real late at night again. It is a little bit too early in the night. - Your tag is out. There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Is it fixed? Thank you. - I can't stand tags being out. - I see that. Well I hope you make it to your car tomorrow, I hope you get a good driver - Thank you, you're sure I can't get your number, I can pay under the table, like twice as much. - That is a very generous offer. - It's just in case 'cause some driver are crazy. - Yeah, that's true, that's true. They don't really vet us that well. - That's here. - Here you are. - Well that was fun. - You have been a delight. - I'll put you five stars. - Thank you, I'll put you five stars too. - If I could put six I would. - That's very nice of you. Have a good night. - You too, bye bye. - And we're out. [NOTIFICATION SOUNDS] - Unfortunately the police officer out there wasn't willing to help me hail a cab even though I can't see very well and there were these small group of people there's two girls and a guy that walked by and the guy was trying to give me his number and I thought well that's kind of strange, you know. So I said no no no it's alright, I appreciate the offer. As he was walking away I yelled out, peace. And so the girls started laughing and the guy was like peace, peace to the middle east. [LAUGHTER] - So you made a friend. - Yeah, yeah exactly I turned a negative situation into a positive. - Yeah, that's good that's really good. Okay, here we are. You need an arm? [PHONE RINGS] Hey, fuzzy. - [WOMAN] Hey, how's your night going? - Good, you got good timing I'm in between rides. - [WOMAN] Are you making millions of dollars. - Millions and millions. - [WOMAN] Alright snuggle me good when you get home. - Always do. - And don't forget, Simon is coming over tomorrow. - Got it. - Okay, I love you. - I love you too. - Night. - Good night, fuzzy. ♪ Don't ask so cynical, ♪ When harder times start to come around ♪ ♪ At this moment it's critical ♪ But you lost your self in the crowd ♪ ♪ And that feeling gets to show ♪ ♪ We're too young to wait too long ♪ ♪ I can give yes I can change ♪ That I'll prove to you some day ♪ ♪ Oh I do it for the girl ♪ Glory in a sinking world ♪ Do it for anyone who's ever hurt you ♪ [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [GASPS] [CRASHING] - Oh god, fuzzy?

So if you're okay with it, let's just keep the meter running and drive me around a bit. - Where? - Your call. What's your favorite place in the city? - Really? - I mean maybe not your favorite if you don't want to give it away but whatever I mean just you know, I really don't want to be at the house so yeah, I'm free. I mean not free, I'll pay you obviously but. - Yeah yeah you got it, sure. - Alright. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] - What is happening? How do you have Brandon's phone? - Babe, it's me. Look, that's you and me. Everything's okay. I can feed you. - I'm not hungry. - If you don't eat, you're gonna be really hungry and you're not gonna feel good. - I'm okay. - I know how you get. - I don't eat breakfast, you should know that. - You always breakfast I bring it to you most the time. - I never eat breakfast. - Fuzzy, you almost always eat breakfast because-- - I never eat breakfast! - How's your night going? - I've had better weeks but the night's not bad, it's getting started, right? - Right. - Really just needed to clear my head, get out for a bit. I like to take a brain break every once in a while. - Brain break, everybody needs a brain break. - No. - I'm gonna back up, look. Okay, just have a little breakfast and relax. You want me to cut it for you? [PHONE BUZZING] - God dammit. - What's going on? - Megan, she wants me to come over there tonight and I just, I don't honestly know if I'm ready for that. - Like, literally two weeks ago was the last time I spoke to him. All he'll do is text me, I tried to call it went straight to voicemail. I mean he's just going through something and we just need to talk in person and we can figure this out. - I've been living with my lady now for probably about almost two years. - Yeah. - And we've been on rocky ground for a couple weeks now so I've just been kind of staying with my friend now to let it, let it air out. - Okay. - Yeah. - Are you gonna make it through it or do you want to or what? - I don't actually know. - Gotcha, gotcha. - I mean we got in a fight but I found a gay dating app on his phone. - And what about you, mate? - Well I am in a functional relationship for probably the first time in my life. - For how long? - We are at the three year mark. - Wow. - Yeah. - I mean that's astounding to me. - Three happy years, too I have to say. I mean there hasn't been any more than just a couple of spats. I mean we've had our serious fights but it's really amazing how the next day we're always just able to kind of wake up and forgive each other. - Come on, breakfast is important, you need to eat. Come on, fuzzy. Here, take it, okay. - What do you do for work? - Photography. - Oh. - Yeah. - And how did you meet your lady? - Okay so long story short, whether it's gonna be long I don't know but long story I guess. We met during a photo shoot and-- - Oh, okay. - Yeah and she's stunning, just beautiful. Caring, sweet, smart, and we met and we didn't leave each others side for two weeks. - One of those where you're just like instantly connected. - Right, absolutely and we've been living together ever since. She had been wanting it to get to go the next step and I've just been a little hesitant to-- - Threesome? - What, no. - No I'm just kidding. Kids or marriage? - Marriage but my lady and I had a bit of an argument, life changing argument and she doesn't really understand my work. You see, when I take a photo, my job isn't to just take the photo you know. It's not to just get a pretty face. - Right. - It's to evoke emotion. I need to be able to say what is going on with your life, I need to be able to feel what it is that's coming from that. And as soon as a I figure that out, I knew how to handle people. And it was all human behavior more than anything, it was just like I knew how to get something from you, you know, no matter what it is. - Alright. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Easy. [KNOCKING] - Simon. - Who is Simon? - Our wedding planner Simon is-- - Oh god, I totally forgot. - Coming over. - Okay. - Simon, Simon. - Let me here, let's take this right here. Don't want you to make a mess [KNOCKING] - Just a second. Yeah, Simon. - Here we go, yeah that's fine. - He's supposed to be coming over. - Okay, I don't wanna hurt you. - Oh my god. - Okay? - Yeah. - I don't want you to look all frumpy. [DOOR CREAKS] - In my business you need to be sort of like a chameleon in order to connect with people. - Yeah. - And it's not a whole lot different than what you probably do, I mean you probably act a little bit different every time you have someone different in your vehicle, right? - Absolutely, I feel like I have to change my personality for every new person I meet. - Brandon? - Yeah, Simon? - It's nice to put a face with name. - Ditto. - Pleasure. Thank you. - Come on in. - But this time I swear, I mean Megan is being completely unreasonable, I mean we would have arguments some time but like stupid little arguments, you know. Like leaving your spit in the sink instead of rinsing it out. - Yeah, no me and my fiancee have the same fight, I think that's just part of a healthy relationship. - You said fiancee. - Yeah I did say fiancee. - Wow. - If you come right here to the left actually we just finished a lot of this. - I love it, love it. - You've got some style I see it there. - Yeah I was actually listening to a podcast that explained how green is like an energy color so it kind of gives you a little extra, you know. And then some cool masks we did, this was kind of my favorite spot. - Awesome. - Some of the shells actually we did a little trip to Hawaii not too long ago so it was nice. - Nice, beautiful. - And I brought some some stuff back, just memory. Oh and, kitchen let me show you real quick. I did, we have this thing about directions it's so weird. But anyway so we did some green throughout 'cause I thought it would just kind of pop, you know. And of course, the beautiful Steph. - So now that I know that you have a fiancee and you know a little bit about me, well if you don't mind me stalking you, can I find you on social media? - Oh, yeah, Brandon Scott. - Scott, that's a neat name, I like that. - Yeah thank you. - Have a seat, Simon. - Hi, how are you. - Thank you. - Thank you so much for coming. - Thank you for having me. - I know it's a pain to come to the house so I appreciate it - I have no problem making house calls, trust me, it's totally fine. - Thank you. - I know you may feel nervous, I want you to know that I'm gonna help guide you through everything, okay? - Yeah. - Good. - What's her name by the way? - Steph. - That's nice, what is your favorite thing about Steph? - I've always been aimless, relatively aimless in my life and I think she identified that in me pretty quickly and so she's able to kind of steer me or help me steer myself, it's definitely not a control thing like she's just able to kind of feel who I am and help me find how to get there. - So let's start with a few pictures of wedding cakes. - Great. - Yeah. - Favorite color is blue. [STUTTERING] - Brandon. Brandon loves chocolate. She loves the color blue. - Chocolate and blue. - Yeah. - Okay guys, look I understand what's going on here. This is a big step. - [LAUGHS] - You guys have some really cute photos. - Yeah, yeah we try and be creative. - There are like a list of photos here where neither of you are smiling. - The Hawaii ones? - I don't know. - Yeah that was, we took a trip to Hawaii and now we're saving up to go to Machu Pichu. We like to go to really beautiful places and take pictures looking as miserable as possible. - So have you all thought about a destination wedding? - We thought about escaping somewhere to not have to deal with family. - An escape is good. - Right. - It's very very manageable and not as expensive as you would think. Any places in mind, beach, outdoors? - You know everything that I love so. - She has mentioned Machu Pichu once. That's a possibility but that's a little more expensive sometimes. - Let's see if we have anything lined up inside. - Oh yeah she is a little cutie, you guys are adorable together. - Oh thank you thank you. - You've made me a huge admirer of your life. - Let me show you all a few options that way we can get an understanding of what you may like. - You know what, Simon let me stop you for a second, we have been so rude, we did not offer you anything to drink. Are you thirsty, I'm actually really thirsty I would love some more water, if possible. - Do you want some water. - Sure, I'll take a glass of water. - Sure, ice? - Ice water's fine, yes. - Maybe some lemon in mine too would be great. - Yeah and here I'll actually take the plates. - In the mean time I'll just show her some things and wait for your opinion when you get back. - For sure. - Okay, so this kind of what I was thinking. - Simon, that's not Brandon. Listen to me, look under the table. You've got to get me out of here. Simon you need to call the police. - Yeah, let me show some photos on my phone, that way maybe we can get a better idea. - Come on, hurry. - I'm trying. - Just hurry up. - What some type of destination or place you. [SCREAMS] - Fuzzy, look what you did. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] - I love you. - Where are we actually going? I'm just driving, I mean I feel bad that we're just driving around. - It's fine really, I really don't have anywhere specific to go. - But this is on your dime, I mean you're paying by the mile and the minute right now, like I feel bad. - I really just don't want to be home so. - I'm sorry, if I'm talking too much just let me know. - No you're fine, hell do you have anywhere you want to go? - I mean yeah, I've got a place that I go when I just need to think. - I like it, let's check it out then. - Sure, that sounds good. [CALM MUSIC] - This is really nice. - Yeah. - And the water's almost like glass. - Yep. - How did you find this place? - When you drive for a living you find a lot of random hidden spaces. - Fair enough. Did you drop someone off that lived in a boat. - I actually did. - Well I'll be damned look at that. - Weird as that sounds and I was like, "so how do you get your mail?" He said it just goes to the dock it wasn't a very climactic story. - It's nice though, it's good. - This is the closest thing I can find in the city to complete silence, so if you need to let anything breathe, breathe. - So earlier, maybe I wasn't as truthful as I should've been about Megan. But you know we're real friends now, you've shown me your spot. - We're no longer in a URYDE car. Well Megan found this dating app on my phone and I met this guy out for a drink, it wasn't like a date, I mean not really you know. Well yeah, okay it was a date. It was a date at that point. - Yeah sounds like a date. - Goddammit. So I met him out and he was really a nice guy I mean just interesting and we chatted for a while. And it started getting closer to literally seconds before we touched lips I froze up because all I could think about was Megan and what it would do to her. I guess I came to the realization that I shouldn't throw away something this good just to try something different. - Yeah, it sounds like you have like an innate curiosity but that you still feel an overwhelming drive to be with her. But kind of like you're not ready to commit yet, maybe. - You've got a way with words, mate. You should start writing or something. - Thank you, thank you. - Or giving relationship advice, whichever one. I don't know I mean it feels you make me feel better about it, like I don't know. Maybe I should go tonight. - Alright, progress, baby steps. - Yeah, I mean if all else we figure it out. We're not wasting our time for me to figure out whatever the hell I want to do. - That's a big step. - Okay. - Shall we go tackle the beast? - I don't know if I'd call, if I call Megan a beast-- - I wasn't calling Megan a beast. - Well you kind of said tackle the beast. - The situation is a beast. - Okay. - The scenario's a beast. - Do you ever tell Steph, hey let's go tackle the beast? - I do, it means a very different thing in that. - Jesus, alright, I'll meet you at the car. You're gonna finish up whatever you're doing out here, nasty. - Okay. - Look see here we go already. She is coming back texting me again about, well I'm gonna tell her that I would like to come see her. - Yeah, I think that's what we do. I think that's the next step. - Alright, said aye alright. She said, I'm welcome to come over. Alright so. Okay. - Do you feel good about it? - Yeah, I do really. - Good. - Because of you mate, thank you. Yeah. - Absolutely. I think it got weird there. - No. - It got weird a little bit. - No weird is like, that's weird. - This is a fast friendship. - That's friendship right there. - Fast friendship right there. That's pretty, I think I don't know if I've ever gotten not to use the word close, but I don't think I've ever gotten-- - Inserted. - Well okay. I feel like you should bring her a gift. - Okay, what about, what about - Champagne? - No no she's not really like a champagne. - Chocolate. - She loves chocolate but I don't know if like-- - It is almost three in the morning. - Yeah I don't know if she's gonna appreciate like a Snickers bar. - I don't know if we're gonna find that. Yeah, from a gas station. - What about-- - Flowers. - She does like flowers. - She does? - She does like flowers. - Okay, okay. - So flower shops stay open til 3 AM-ish most of the time or did you know somewhere that-- - No I was thinking we steal some flowers. - You want to go steal flowers. - I was thinking about it. - From where? - What are you doing with your face. - This is my devious face. - You can't make that face if you're gonna do it. - It's my devious face not my relationship helper face. - What is the-- - I have a completely different face for that. - Show me that one. Let's just stick with the flowers. Do you usually bring Stephanie flowers when-- - I think that Steph probably gives me some pity smiles because she probably prefers something else but she's always fine with them I mean she's happy, it's the thought that counts. What? - I was just-- - What? - I was just enjoying how both of you settle for shit if the other one's happy. [LAUGHTER] - I guess that's the sign of a good relationship. - So flowers, flowers. Omelets with avocado and kale. Favorite color is blue, what does she do for a living? Did you tell me that? - She's a psychology major. - Oh wow, alright. - Yeah. - And she's smart, I like that. - Yes, oh yes, very smart. Smarter than me probably. What is your plan? - Now it is get flowers. - Right, flowers are good, how do you explain the app. - I'm hoping that if I can explain to her what I explained to you, I realized that I didn't want to lose her because of how important she-- - Nailed it. - I thought, like start with how important she is, right? - Yes, nailed it. - Yeah, because when I was explaining it to you I really didn't hesitate, well I hesitated for a little bit because it's kind of scary telling a complete stranger that you have a gay dating app on your phone and went on a date. - I hey man, to each their own, I am not on this planet to judge people. - Well that's fantastic but I have not been in a committed relationship with you and I'm not bringing you flowers that my URYDE driver stole out of someone's yard. [CALM MUSIC] - This is my URYDE protection, Steph insists I keep it in here. Come on. - Alright. Do you really need a knife. Alright, okay I guess we're really doing this. - Are you gonna, am I doing this by myself or what? - What is that, what are these things? - I don't know I didn't take botany. - Save that one. It looks like-- Yeah well she does like purple and that's purple so that's actually. - Here. - She's gonna love this and looks just like you bought it from a store. She's never gonna know. - I don't think you're supposed to eat the flowers. - It's Kale. That's really good Kale. - Should I bring Megan a smoothie? - That's good, this is a good one. That's pretty. - It is very pretty. - That light just come on? [ENGINE STARTS] - And then we just disappear into the cover of night and nobody even knows we were here. [CALM MUSIC] - Thank you. - I'm nervous for you. Is this the place? - This is it. I've got my flowers. - Flowers in hand. - That was an and. And I guess this is where we slay the beast? - Tackle. - Tackle the beast. This is where we tackle the beast. - Yeah. - Yeah slaying is something else isn't it. - Yeah. - Alright. - You okay? - Yeah I think so. - Is this the end of our road? Do I finally end trip? - Actually let's do this here. Twenty. Thank you, okay. - Yeah absolutely. - You've been fantastic. - Thank you. - Alright, I'm gonna make this happen. - Do I wait? - If this goes well, I get to move back into my own home, if it does not I will be back here I guess. - Okay, how long do I wait? - Twenty. [NOTIFICATION SOUND] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [BANGING] Fuck, fucking hell. Shit. Shit shit fucking hell. Why the fuck would she do that? Fuck. We can go. - Okay. You okay? - Yeah, yeah I'm fine. - So you broke up? - Yeah I mean I just-- - But I mean that's okay right, I mean that's okay that's-- - I don't know I don't know if it's okay because I don't know that that's what I wanted to do in the first place and I don't know if. I need a fucking drink is what I need, I need a drink. - Done. [ELEVATOR MUSIC] - What? - I'm buying them for you. - You're not buying my beer. - I'm buying these for you, it's the least I can do. How's your night going? - Good, how are you? - Wonderful, thank you. - Just swipe your card there, please. - Yes, sir. - Your beers. - Your beer, you keep that one. - I'm gonna jump in the back, charge my phone up. That fine with you? - Yeah, I can't drive with this. - Yeah you can. - So where are we headed? Should I just take you back to your buddy's where I picked you up? Judd? - Yeah, that's fine. - Want to talk about anything that happened at Megan's house. Kind of interested to know what that was. - I don't really want to talk about it. - I mean, I'd look at it this way. You can go on whatever kind of date you want to, with whoever you want to now. I mean, when you got in the car you barely knew whether you wanted the relationship to work or not. So you know silver lining. - You're not from here, right? - No. - Where are you from? - Wyoming. - Talk to your parents often? - No, maybe three four times a year at this point. - What was it you said you called your lady? - Ms. Fuzz, or Fuzzy. It's funny, right? - [JUDD] Yeah. - You want me to turn the radio on or something? I feel like you just kind of want me to shut up. - Yeah, I like the silence. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [ENGINE REVVING] [NATURE SOUNDS] [SENTIMENTAL MUSIC] - [WOMAN] The key to making a perfect kale omelet is to keep the temperature low. [SINISTER MUSIC] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] - Shirt.

Then I got you up and got you dressed for the day. It's one of my favorite sweaters on you. - Does my omelet have any salt on it? - So stupid. Do you want me to get some? - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. What are you doing? - I was just looking at this picture of us. - Yeah, no it's just one of my favorite pictures of us. - I don't remember where we took it. - It was in Hawaii babe, on vacation. - Guess I hit my head harder than I thought. - Tell me when. - When. - There you go.

Can you take me to our spot, please. - Do you feel better? - Yeah, I feel better. - You sure? - I just want you to take me to our spot. - I don't want to get you-- - Yeah I just want to get out of here. - If you don't feel good. - I feel good, will you untie me please, please untie me. Please untie me, hey it's me. It's me. It's me. Just take me to our spot, okay. Just take me please. - Okay. - Just untie me. - Alright, you're a little stressed out, I don't want you to feel bad.

Sorry you got so scared. - It's okay. - I'm glad you're feeling better though. - Thank you. - What did you do yesterday? - Drove most night, I didn't go as late as I normally do though, it was like somewhat busy but you know once the fare started getting really high everybody kind of backed off even more. - Did you pick up anybody interesting? - Yeah, there was one guy that was kind of. He was funny, like you know? - Where did you pick that guy up? - I don't remember the exact, specific location but you know. - What was his name? - Derek, I think. - Derek? - Yeah, he was nice, you know. - Anybody not nice? - No. [TIRES SCREECH] - It was not what it looked like, I was just saying hi.
