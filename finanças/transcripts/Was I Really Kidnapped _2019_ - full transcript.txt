Hey. Hey. Wait. Wait. Hey. Wait. Please. Please help me. Please. Please help me, ma'am. Please. Please. Please. Please. Help! Please. Please. Please. Please, he's coming. Please he's going to come. He's coming, He's coming. All I know is Detective Flores said she was in observation. I'm just happy she's alive. - We're looking for Elle Whitland. - Are you family? - Yes, I'm her boyfriend, Billy Johnson. - And I'm her sister, Jen Whitland. Okay. The sister and the boyfriend. - Is she hurt? - She's going to be okay, - but she's pretty shaken up. - What happened to her? Can we see her? You can, we just need you to keep it brief. We've still going to get her statement, figure out what happened. Of course. Oh! - Where were you? Are you okay? - I was taken. Taken? By who? Look, Elle, I'm... I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you. - Can we take her home? - We need to talk to her first. - Hasn't she been through enough? - It's okay Billy. I want to help. - Can we stay? - Actually, we need to talk to you as well. I already told the other officer everything I knew when I reported her missing 3 days ago. Well, Elle's memories may trigger other details for you that could help with the investigation. Okay, sure. Whatever it takes to catch the creep who took her. Would you mind waiting? We'd like to talk to you as well. - Of course. - You and I can talk down at the station - while Elle gets her tests done. - No, I don't want to leave her again. Protocol dictates that we get her statement alone. Shall I call her psychiatrist, Dr. Kilmeade? He's been treating her since she was young. - Hasn't he done enough? - We'd like to talk with anybody who could shed some light on this case. We're just so glad you're back. - Yeah, me too. - Shall we? I'll see you soon. Will you be okay? What's that for? That's to record every detail and statement in case we need it for reference. I just... I don't understand. Why me? Well, that's what we're here to find out. But I told you already, I don't remember anything. You were last seen 3 days ago. Maybe we can start with what you do recall. Can you tell me what happened the morning of the kidnapping? Billy brought me breakfast in bed. Happy anniversary, beautiful. - Anniversary? - Yeah. Our first date was exactly one year ago today. Does that one even count? I... I spent the first hour on the worst blind date ever, before you came by and spilled a drink over him. Yeah, well, that smooth move rescued you from listening to the perils of gingivitis. First and last time I ever date a periodontist. And just think... he could be the one proposing to you right now. Proposing? What are you doing? I knew you were the one from the moment we met. Every day shines a little brighter with you in my life, and... I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Elle Margaret Whitland, will you marry me? Billy, I love you. But marriage, it's a big word. It's also a wonderful word. One year isn't enough time to fully know each other and... I love you, but... - we don't need to rush. - I thought we were on the same page. Well, you're making it sound like an ultimatum. Fine. We can talk about this when I get home from work. Billy, no... I'm sorry. Let's talk about it now. How upset was he? Well, I've never seen him slam a door like that before. It felt like I betrayed him. - Did you two fight often? - No. No, but I mean I wouldn't call that a fight. It was more like an ongoing disagreement. And was he pushing to marry you? Billy has his whole life sorted out. He's the rising star at work, he owns his own home, I'm just kind of like the missing piece of the puzzle. Do you feel like just a piece? No... Hi. Thank you, doctor. It looks like we can join them down at the station. I'm going to let your sister know, okay? Okay. So you proposed... And she said no? Well, yeah. It didn't go the way I had hoped it would. Marriage is a big word. It's also a wonderful word. It means I get to spend the rest of my life with you. We don't need a piece of paper to do that. It's about vows, and commitment. You know, family. None of which stopped my parents from attacking each other in divorce court. Yeah but, you know, look at mine, thirty years later and they're still holding hands. It's too soon. We've only been dating a year. I understand that, but when you know, you know. You know? Could we at least talk about it over dinner? I got to get to work. - Yeah, of course. - Okay. - I love you. - I love you too. It's barely 9:00, how rough could your day be already? Well, I proposed to Elle. She said she needed more time, again. Ahhh... that is rough. - I'm sorry, man. - Yeah. Hey, on the bright side, at least she didn't fail to mention she was calling it off as your family flew in from all over the country. To top it off, everyone kept their gifts! I'm still paying for it! You never told me that before. After a while, I realized she wasn't the one. The divorce bill would've cost ten times more. One thing I do know... There's plenty of fish in the sea. Yeah, well I don't need another fish. - So that annoyed you? - Yeah. ''Plenty of fish'' Yeah, it was tacky, but, I mean, what else do you expect from the beat reporter who can't keep a date longer than it takes to read his column. Right. Come on in. You can take a seat. We can pick up where we left off. I'm sorry I'm having a hard time remembering anything. You're doing great. What happened after Billy left for work? I called my sister. - You said no? - Well, I didn't actually use the word ''no''. But he's a good guy. He wakes up and cleans the house every Saturday morning so you can sleep in. Who does that? Seriously, who does that? I know he's great, I just... I don't know if I'm ready. - You already live together. - In his house. And you don't want to be with other people and you said he'd make a great father. What's holding you back? We didn't exactly have the most solid role models. We are not our parents... And if they were still here, they would tell us, do your own thing. Someone should take her own advice. If I did, I would have married a very wealthy man! I just hope he's willing to wait around. - What do you mean? - Good guys don't stick around forever... Trust me. - Well now you're stressing me out. - That is the last thing I want to do. You know that no one is rooting for your happiness more than me. Thanks. Maybe you should ask Dr. Kilmeade what he thinks at your next session? Actually, I stopped seeing him. - Really? When? - About six months ago. You never told me this. I do have a life of my own, you know... Besides, I didn't want you to worry. I figure fifteen years of therapy is probably enough. Was he okay with that? Not exactly. You've come a long way, Elle. I'm really proud of you. Give me some of this. Okay then. Okay, so tell me how it goes tonight! - I will. Love you. - Love you more. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm just thinking about what I'm going to say tonight. You'll figure it out. Thanks. Hi, Jack. Nice to see you, Elle. We have your re-fill ready. You're always one step ahead of me. It's my job. Oh! Hey, I read your last blog. The one on wine pairings. ''A Cabernet that smells of leathery cherry and dusty roads'' ''in perfect harmony with a marbled bone-in steak.'' It's like food poetry. Wow. I had no idea anyone actually read my blog. Well, it made me sound like Richard Branson on my last date. You're too funny. So? Are you going to see her again? I don't think she's the one. Well, keep searching. She's out there for you somewhere. Until next time. Thanks! Billy, hey. I'm really sorry about this morning. When are you coming home? We should figure this out together. Do you know where he was? No, I hadn't heard from him since he left for work that morning. What time did you get home that night? Later than I planned for. - Hey, I'm put of here. - Frank just told me here's two structure fires happening right now. One on Oakland, one in Milton. Are you serious. I got to get home. Dead serious. I can cover both if you want. I'll tell Frank you had to go. No, no. I'll go. - Where were they again? - I'll take Milton then, - you take Oakland. - All right. He wants us to file by midnight. Sorry, bro. So I called Elle to tell her I'd be home late and then I went to cover the fire. Is there anyone we can talk to from the fire who saw you? Sorry, are you checking my alibi? No, no, we're just trying to cross people off the list. - Yeah. - There were some firefighters there. But you know, there was a bit of a commotion, - so I couldn't really get their attention. - Right. Ended up interviewing a couple of neighbours. Did you get any of their names? No, they didn't want their names in print. And what time did you leave the fire? Must have been just before midnight. I went straight home from there after I filed my story. Then at around 10 p.m. I went upstairs and got ready for bed. Hello? Billy? Billy, we should talk about this. So you said you left the fire before midnight, right? What happened when you got home? Well, it was weird because the door was unlocked. Elle always locks the door. Hey, Elle, are you up? Hello. Elle, are you still up? The door's unlocked. Elle? Billy? ''Hey, hey. Sorry to wake you.'' Is Elle at your place? No. Why? What's wrong? ''Well, she's not here.'' She didn't mention anything about going out when I saw her today. Did she tell you what happened between us? Yeah, but she said you guys were going to talk about it more tonight. ''Yeah, I just got home.'' Doesn't she go for a walk when she feels anxious? Yeah, but I mean, never this late, ''her car's still here, and she's clearly been drinking so...'' I'll make a quick drive around the neighbourhood just to make sure. Billy, I'm worried. ''Don't worry yet. I'll get back to you.'' So did you go looking for her? Yeah, I drove around the block twice and... I didn't see her anywhere so I came home. What time did you get back? Must have been around 01:00. And you didn't think that was a dangerous time for your girlfriend to be out walking alone? Yeah, obviously, but... I didn't know what else to do. We can't find anyone that places you at the fire that night. Well, then you can read my article if you don't believe me. There were lots of people there, It's just... no one remembers seeing you. It's because I never got out of my car. What really happened, Billy? I wrote about the fire at my desk and then I filled it. You fabricated the story? No. No, the fire actually happened, I just wrote about it generally. And I drove by it afterwards and made up a few quotes for colour. So what happened when you got home? Everything after that all happened. That was all true. I waited up for Elle, I had a glass of wine, then I passed out. I don't know, man. If that was me, and I got home in the middle of the night, my girlfriend wasn't there, I think I'd call it in. I was trying to give her space. I didn't want to push her away further if she was having doubts... Okay. I'll be right back. How'd that go? - The boyfriend's lying. - Really? What kind of a man is fine with getting shut down like that? What does this have to do with he kidnapping? What else is he lying about? So you think he's involved? It's usually someone close to the victim, right? Yeah, maybe. But come on, that's a bit of stretch. Let's check his phone records and see if he even reached out to her? I can follow up with the hospital and see if they've got the results... - from the rape kit. - Cool. Thank you. Is there anything that you can remember... about the place where you were held? It was really dark and cold. Help! Help! Help! Help. Please. Please. Let me go, please. Why are you doing this to me? Hello, Elle. You have no idea how long I've waited for this moment. Who are you? In time. In time. No, please! Please don't. It felt like there was a big weight on me... and I couldn't breathe really. I'm sorry, Elle. This is helpful information though. You said something that might be useful... that he used your name? That means he knows you. I have a blog. Is your picture up on your site? No, it isn't. Is there anything familiar about him? Maybe something that he said? Or the way he smelled? I keep seeing the inside of a van. Good. What colour was the van? White, I think? And was there anything in the van? I don't know! Why don't we take a break? I'm going to fill my partner in, and then I need to speak with your sister. Yeah, yeah, okay. Just get me those results as soon a possible. Thanks. - Anything? - No. I got his phone records. He never even called her that night like he said he did. Really? Well, where did his phone ping while she was missing? Off the tower near his office, and then at home and then at the police department the next day. And get this, it was off for long stretches. - What about hers? - Never left the house for 3 days. I'm going to talk to the sister, see what I can find out about their past. - Let me know. - Yeah, for sure. Hello. She said she was taken. Who took her? Well, that's what we're trying to figure out. - Is she okay? - She's been through a lot, but she's strong. I knew we should've gone to the police that first night. What happened that night after Billy called you? I waited up for an hour after we talked. I tried calling him back. He didn't answer. I drove over there at 7:00 a.m. the next morning... just to make sure everything was okay. Billy! Where are you? Why didn't you call me back last night? - I feel asleep on the couch... - Where is she? She's not answering any of my calls. Did she come home? - I don't know. I... - Elle! Are you here? We need to go to the police. It has to be 48 hours before they'll do anything. Unless there's a crime scene. What if there a sign of distress? - I'm going. - I didn't see that last night. Hey, I'm coming with you. So who filed the missing person report that day? I did. Jen came with me to the station. Jen. Did you hear from her? She's not here? That's why I was calling! I fell asleep, I'm sorry. I waited up for hours. - She never came home. - Did she call? - My phone's dead. - She's not answering my calls. She always answers my calls. - Let's just go to the police. - Okay, - I'll call the hospital on the way. - I'll drive. As suspected the police officer never even took it seriously because it hadn't been 24 hours yet. You seem upset by that. Yeah, I still am. I knew something had happened to her, nobody was doing anything about it. And I was right. Someone did take her. And yet, you didn't feel it was serious enough to call in the night before? Elle told me about the proposal. How was her relationship with Billy overall? They seemed happy, unless the future came up. This ravioli is heaven. You remember that old Italian woman that I met at the restaurant? Well, she finally relented and gave me her recipe. Yeah, I swear Elle almost fainted when she gave it to her. If I hadn't been there, I think, your sister might have jumped on a plane to Florence with her. My dream is to get a house on lake Como and just taste everything in that country! Maybe we should plan a group trip. The four of us could split on a small villa. - What do you say, Ryan? You into it? - That does sound amazing. Might be out of my price range until I pay off a few more lingering bills. Are you still paying off your student loans, too? That, and credit cards which saved me from being homeless after I got downsized at The Express. Did it take you long to find a new job? The newspaper business is about as flimsy as the paper it's printed on these days. Well, we're lucky to have you at The Chronicle. Yeah, Billy says great things about your work. He's really impressed with the articles you're writing. Really? It's tough keeping up with the boss's shining star. Please, do not make Billy's head any bigger than it already is. I've heard Lake Como is a beautiful spot for honeymooners. I mean, if you and Billy are thinking about tying the knot. Well, one of us definitely thought about it, huh? I think that's my cue to go check on the dessert. I'll see if she needs any help. What was that all about? Billy keeps dropping hints about getting married, but we've only been dating for ten months. - It's way to soon. - It's not a crime to talk about it. Yeah, between him and I. Not in front of other people. So, any sparks with Ryan? He seems like a nice guy, but I don't think he's my type. - What? Why? - He seems like a guy who plays it a little safe. I need someone with a bit of edge. You care a lot about your sister. She's been through a lot. Do you think that Billy was pushing too hard? She didn't like it when he put pressure on her. Is there any thing you can think of that would make Elle not want to be with him? She knew he was a solid guy. I think she just wanted to let it grow organically. Those are all the questions that I have right now. Do you mind waiting around for Elle in case there's anything else - we need to clear up? - Of course. Whatever I can do to help. I appreciate everything you've shared about the hours leading up to Elle's disappearance. I hope it helps you catch the guy. Me too. You see, the problem I'm having is just that your story is inconsistent. How so? Well, she said you had a disagreement after you proposed. You said everything was fine. Yeah, everything was going to be fine. Why did you say you called her that night? Because I did. Your phone records don't show any calls to Elle that day or night. Hold on a second. You have my phone records? - Yeah. - I didn't consent to that. You share a plan with Elle, we don't need your permission. We noticed your phone was off for long stretches. All right. Honestly, I wanted to make myself scarce, I wanted her to worry about what it would be like if I wasn't around. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Why does any of this matter? Well you see, the timing is just kind of odd. Don't you think? I mean, your phone is conveniently off when your girlfriend goes missing. Sorry, are you accusing me of doing something wrong? Have you done anything wrong? No. I've spent the last 3 days looking for my missing girlfriend! Hi. Sorry to interrupt. - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. Be right back. Well, he doesn't look too happy. Yeah, I think he finally realized he's now a person of interest. Her tox screen came back and she had high levels of ketamine in her system. She didn't strike me as the dance club type. Well, she's had a pretty interesting past. Let's get her shrink in here, see if he can corroborate any of this. I already called him and he's on his way in. Perfect. Let me know when he gets here. Our therapist mentioned you remembered something just now? He mentioned something about his past. Tell me. You look so sweet when you sleep, just like my fiancee. Fiancee? Who? She's gone. Didn't understand the word commitment. Why are you doing this? You won't ever leave me, will you? I just don't know why he chose me. You've been through a lot, I heard what happened when you were 10. My best friend Sarah and I used to walk home from school together every day. Then one day there was a man there with a van. I told her not to go over there. And he took her. How did you cope with the trauma of Sarah's disappearance? I tried to hurt myself but that was a long time ago. Did you ever do drugs to deal with the pain? No. Your tox screen came back positive for Ketamine and other amphetamines. I only take the drugs prescribed to me by doctor Kilmeade. Is it possible that he could have prescribed that to you for depression? Why are you asking me these questions? The guy who kidnapped me drugged me which is why I can't remember anything. Well, Dr. Kilmeade is on his way down to the station he can probably help us clear up this. Good, I need to see him. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to waive the doctor-patient confidentiality? - Yeah, sure. If you think it'll help. - I do. Thank you. - She signed the waiver. - Great. Maybe the good doctor can help us unscramble this story. She keeps talking about white vans it's like a childhood nightmare. Pick your poison. Unstable victim, lying boyfriend. Well, without her statement we don't have anything to go right now. I know, that's what's go me worried. We'll talk in a bit. They're treating me like a suspect number one in there. - What do you mean? - They're questioning... - every detail I give them. - Hopefully it helps them... - build a timeline of events. - Of course, but... they think that I was angry with Elle for turning me down. They're constructing this ridiculous narrative. Elle did say you were upset. You never told me she said that. I didn't want to get in the middle of your relationship. I was going to work. We were going to talk about it when I got home. I'm just telling you what she said. They should be out looking for whoever took her, not wasting time on us. Dr. Kilmeade? Jen, I'm so glad they found her. - What are you doing here? - We asked him to come in. Did you ask him about how he used to brainwash her? - Doctor. - And that's why she stopped seeing you. - What was that about? - That guy did weird things to her. - She never mentioned that to me. - Yeah, hypnosis. He was implanting memories in her head. She liked seeing him. He really helped her. We're better off without him. I'd like to talk to Elle right away I'm worried she may fall back to her past state. What state is that exactly? I can't disclose that, detective. Doctor-patient confidentiality. She waived it. As a child, she suffered a trauma that left her with a personality disorder which makes her inherently question reality. I brought her back to life and helped her become the woman she is today. No one knows Elle like I do. What are you trying to say here? Did the kidnapping happen or not? It happened... what's uncertain is whether Elle was there to witness it... or whether she manifested that in her head. Either way the incident left her traumatized. - So she might've made it up? - No. It's not that simple. The brain doesn't separate reality versus perceived reality. It was real to her. My hypnosis stabilized her. Has she ever turned to drugs? To escape her problems. - Not that I'm aware of. - We found Ketamine in her system. - Well, she didn't get it from me. - We didn't say she did. Look, Doctor, we're trying to figure out what happened here. When we found her she was heavily drugged. You're telling us that she's got PTSD. She can barely remember anything but what she does remember is similar to what happened to her when she was a kid. So, is it possible that this whole thing's in her mind? Anything is possible but I won't know until you let me talk to her. - Didn't she stop seeing you? - That was Billy's doing. - And how are things with Billy? - They're okay. Did something happen? Well, it's not a big deal, it's just... Jen invited us to her class's holiday recital and Billy agreed to come with me. Then the day of the event he denied ever committing to it and tried to make me feel bad about it. - Did you talk to him about it? - Yeah but he said that I remembered it wrong. Have you started writing things down like we talked about? You don't need someone making you second guess your memories. Actually there's something that I wanted to talk you about. Yeah, of course. I'm ready to try everything that you've taught me, just on my own. Is this you talking or Billy? He doesn't even know that I'm here. Elle, you shouldn't let him dictate your actions. We're making great progress with your therapy. I'm ready to do this. I've made up my mind. It seems that you and Billy have very different ideas on what's best for Elle. He seems to have selective memories when it comes to her. I don't think he has her best interests at heart. Were you upset when she wanted to stop therapy? No, I knew she'd eventually come back to me. Well, if you could just let us know where you were on the night of her disappearance we're done here. I'll have my secretary call you. - Did they let you see her? - No. She should be back in my care as soon as possible. This is not good for her. - Ryan? - Hey, man. - What's going on? - Some detective called me in to talk about Elle's kidnapping. - Guess he wants you to verify my story. - No problem, I'm happy to help. Thanks for coming in, Ryan. Right this way. So is Dr. Kilmeade here? Did he clear up the whole drug thing? Do you ever experience delusions, Elle? No. Who would create a story about being captive for three days only to go to the cops and be told that you're a liar. Okay. Well then, how did you escape? I do not know... "I just remember waking up in the gas station." Help! Please stop! Please. Please open up, please. Stop. "Well, it's amazing that he let you go." Most girls would not be so fortunate in that situation. You should be looking for him instead of questioning me. So what was Billy's demeanor like when he came back into work while Elle was still missing? As expected, he was stressed. He seemed pretty frustrated that things were not moving fast enough with your investigation Hey, man. - Any word on Elle? - Nothing. Look, we know the first 48 are the most important. - Anything I can do to help? - I am going to get the story out. - She is been on every channel. - Yeah, but the police department is barely doing anything. I have got to put more pressure on them to get more resources - dedicated to her case. - Want me to write it? No, I will. It is a little close to home, do not you think? I can make it more objective. But if it is an exclusive first person account on the front page, they won't be able to ignore me. I just do not know if writing it yourself is a good idea. Frank already gave me the okay. You do not waste time, do you? Is that normal? For a journalist to write a personal story like that? It is not typical, but neither is a reporter losing his girlfriend... And with layoffs looming, I can understand why he might want to write it himself. Layoffs? Why do you think that factored into his decision? I know he wanted to find her, and making it onto the front page two days in a row definitely got people talking about Elle. Well, it certainly got the chief's attention. He forced the department to pull people from other cases to just go out looking for this one woman. But you found her, so it worked. She re-appeared. What do you know about Billy and Elle's relationship? They seemed to be alright. Nothing too out of the ordinary. So, Elle, have you ever been to Italy? It is number one on my bucket list. Have you? One day. I want to rent a house in Lake Como. - Oh, that sounds amazing. - We should plan a group trip. Yeah, I do not know if that is in the cards for Ryan right now. Express layoff kind of set you back, eh buddy? We had a lot of friends affected by the layoffs. It is awesome that you landed on your feet. Yeah, it took awhile, but I am grateful for the job. The newspaper business, it is about as flimsy as the paper - it is printed on. - Only the best and brightest survive, eh? I have read some of your pieces, Ryan, and they are really great. Hey, easy on the compliments, all right? We do not want his ego getting too big. Do not worry, honey? we are just trying to catch up with yours. I have heard Lake Como is a beautiful spot to honeymoon. Well, if that is what it takes to get a ring on this girl's finger, let's book the flights right now. I think that is my cue to go check on dessert. I will help. I am sorry, man. I did not mean to make it uncomfortable. Oh no, she is fine. One way or another, we are going to be together forever. You know, to me the guy kind of sounds like a jerk. I would call him confident. Yeah, well his confidence was unwarranted since she said no to his proposal. Do not you think? I just think he loves her and wants it to work. You could be right. Thank you for allowing me to ask you some difficult questions today. Can I see my sister now? I hope you know we are doing everything in our power to try and figure out what happened? Why do not you come with me? - Hey. - Come her. Hey, we finally go home. - Can you stay with us tonight? - Of course, what ever you need. Your test results should be back soon. We will be in touch with any updates. And we ask that you all stay by, just in case we get any information that we need to cross check. Wait, so that is it? what, you guys are no further ahead? We learned a lot today. Thanks, detective. We need to look into his past. He lied to us twice and he wanted to write this big story. I just can not get a read on her. Clearly she is experienced some sort of a trauma, "but she is got a history of paranoid delusions" "It is just so frustrating not being able to remember more" "You have been through hell. None of this is your fault." The detectives do not believe me. You know, Billy had the same feeling. - Like they are treating him like a suspect. - Why? I do not know. Something about him getting a boost from the stories - he wrote about your disappearance. - So what are you saying? That he did this to me to get ahead in his career. And so you would know how much you needed him? Whoa! Whoa! "Dr. Kilmeade got in touch," "he is got an opening tomorrow if you want it." Well, I think that is a good idea. I mean, what if it was him trying to get you back - after you stop seeing him? - He saved my life once. I trust him. Look, he had you feeling things that never even happened. Just because you do not remember it, does not mean it did not happen. Let's take a breath. "Obviously we all want the same thing here." "Why did not you call me back that day?" Because my phone died when I went to cover the fire. I am going to go lie down. It's time for you to go, Elle. Please don't do it. We'll find each other again. - No. - We're meant to be. No. Have you remembered anything else since you got home? No, just nightmares. I wish some memories would start to come back. Well, memory loss is a natural side effect of Ketamine. How did you know he gave me Ketamine? The police told me, when they asked me about the medicines I've prescribed you. Do they have anyone they're looking at? I just want to put the attack behind me. Hypnotherapy might help you remember details that could lead us to who did this. I don't want to relive it again. How's Billy handling everything? He didn't want me to come back here. Yet you came. I don't want to fall back to where I was. I can help you with that. But it seems to me like, Billy doesn't want you to get better. Do you really think that? My job is to listen and observe. And it seems to me like he's trying to control you. Maybe you should reclaim some space while you heal. Well, I could stay with Jen for a little bit. Yeah. I'm going to write you a new prescription. It should help with the anxiety and bad dreams. Do you really think that I should be, taking something new right now? It shouldn't interfere with your current meds, but ultimately it is your choice. Elle. You're all over the news. How are you doing? I've been better. Dr. Kilmeade called in your new prescription. Did he tell you about them? Yes. You look good, considering... My sister is waiting I should get going. Until next time. - Hey, Ryan. - Elle. I'm glad you're okay. We were all really worried about you. Yeah, still trying to figure out everything. - Do you know where Billy is? - He's with Frank. You can hang at his desk until he comes back. A lot of eyes were on your story. Really? Most views in like, 5 years I think. Billy pushed Frank to cover it, he felt like it was the only way to put pressure on the police. I'm really lucky. Do they have any suspects? No, there's no updates from the police yet. Billy is already planning to write a follow up, to make sure they don't drop the ball again, you know, with the guy still out there. Right. The detectives called again, they raised questions about some of the facts in your articles. Based on what? She was kidnapped, and they did nothing until their hand was forced. The editorial board is performing a full review of all your articles in the last year. If there's anything you want to tell me, now is the time. I've told you everything, Frank. I don't make up stories. I hope you're right, Billy. We launched some pretty big accusations against the police department. Go home until you hear from me. - Are... - Come on. The police have the paper questioning my reporting. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Come on, I'm suspended until further notice. I should write a piece on abuse of power. Why did you write that article about me? Because no one was doing anything. I was worried about you, Elle. I wanted to help. Yeah, but why not ask somebody else to write it? I did, I asked Ryan if he would write it. And then everyone seemed to think that, you know, it'd get more attention if I wrote it and... it did. Every cop in the city was on your case. When were you planning on telling me that you're going to write a follow up? What? Who told you that? I'm just trying to make sense of everything. I still don't understand why you didn't call me back that day. Okay, so, is this Dr. Kilmeade putting these in your head again? I refused your proposal, you're trying to keep your job, - you lie to the police and then... - Elle, honestly? Not knowing if you were alive or not nearly killed me. The reason I lied about calling you is because, I felt like an asshole, okay? I wanted you to chase me for once. And I nearly lost you. I wish I could believe you. But I think I need to spend some time alone right now. Elle, don't do this, please. Please, hey, hey, hey, no, please. We need to stick together, please. I've got to go, Billy. - Hey. - Hey. Take a look at this. No physical injuries. No DNA, no semen presence. How do you explain that? Not a trace of evidence that this woman was raped or even kidnapped. She was drugged? Maybe he used protection? Or maybe Billy and her concocted the story so that he could become the hotshot reporter he aspires to be. He has no criminal history, that's a pretty thin motive to pin everything on. Yeah, nothing in this case adds up. - I'm going to the chief. - To tell him what? Recommend that we suspend the investigation pending further developments. Come on. No, No, No. No. Elizabeth Margaret Whitland, will you marry me? - No. - We're meant to be. - Forever. - No! No. No. No! No! - Billy? - ''I just got off the phone'' with the Detectives. They're calling off the investigation - pending new leads. - ''How can they do that?'' I don't know, I'm trying to find out on what grounds. Okay, keep me posted. Maybe you can write about it? ''If I don't lose my job, maybe.'' I'll get back to you. Just give Elle my best, please. What was that about? It's nothing to worry about right now. Jen, stop treating me like a child. It was Billy. The detectives are dropping the investigation. I can't believe this. What's this? The board found many inconsistencies in your articles that we believe amount to fabrications. - You're firing me? - I think you're a good reporter, but you need to stick to the facts going forward. My girlfriend was kidnapped, I was treading water keeping up with work - while I was looking for her. - Integrity's everything in this business and perception is reality. I'm sorry, man, I don't know what to say. There's nothing to say. Ryan, I need you to cover this. Hey. She doesn't want to see you right now, Billy. I don't know what else to say. I need to talk to her. Please, Jen. It's OK. You can come in. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. So humiliating. Listen, you're not crazy. you were the victim, you were taken. I know you, Elle. You're the most important thing in my life. You trust me, right? I do trust you, I just... Let me help you find out what happened to you. The guy knew my name. He took me from our home. It has to be someone I know. Okay. That's a good starting point. We can figure this out together. What about your trainer, Max? No. he's out. I asked around, he has a boyfriend. They were on a date the night I went missing. And your pharmacist, Jack? He's friendly. Too friendly? I don't know, I never really thought of it like that, but yeah. Yeah, I guess he is a little flirty. I'll do some more digging on him. Hey, ask if he has a fiancee, the guy always mentioned her. So, what about Dr. Kilmeade? I found an old news article on him. Did you know he was sued for malpractice? A sexual assault victim had a seizure while under hypnosis in his office. Whoa. He thinks you didn't want me to get better, Well, he's been putting things in your head ever since we met. We should follow up with him tomorrow, just to be sure. Maybe that's enough for today? This is a good start. Yeah, I hope it helps. You're doing great, Elle. Call me if you need anything. Okay. Elizabeth Margaret Whitland, will you marry me? Billy? No. We will be together forever! No! no, no, no, no, no. - Elle? hey, hey, Elle. - Stop it! Hey, hey, Elle? Elle! it's just me. It's me. Hey, hey. I heard you screaming. I came upstairs and you were tearing the room apart. He was here. I saw him and he, - he looked just like you. - It was just a nightmare. I was downstairs checking in on the pharmacist. I am losing my mind. Did you take your meds? Yeah. This is a Steroid? Night terrors are a common side effect. Why would Dr. Kilmeade prescribe me something like that, when he knows I'm already getting nightmares? I'm going to his office tomorrow. And do what? Find out why he's drugging you. - See you in the morning? - Have a goodnight. Goodnight. "Patient has expressed desire to end sessions. Do not recommend." "Elle needs me, and I need her?" What the... I could have you arrested for breaking into my office. Yeah, good idea. Call the cops. I'm sure they'd love to see what I just found. Okay, I can explain. Stay down! Stay down! Billy, hey! - What'd you find? - We got him. What do you mean? It was him? Yeah, I caught him red handed, and he tried to run. The cops have him now, and the detectives are on their way. I just... I don't understand how he could do that to me. "Well, he knew your history, Elle." He had access to drugs, and he was clearly obsessed with you. - It makes sense. - So, it's over? Yeah. "You're safe now." I'll call you from the station, but it's finally over. Thank you, Billy. It's time for you to go. Please don't kill me. No, please. I'll do anything you want. I know you will. We're meant to be. I didn't take her. Like I told you, I was at a medical conference in New York. "We know you checked in to the conference," but we're just waiting on an eye witness to verify that you actually attended it. You're looking at felony kidnapping and sexual assault. - What? - Yeah, so, why don't you just save us all some time and tell us what really happened. I just, I just wanted her to come back to me. I got it. Sounds more like you were obsessed with her, to me. His alibi for the kidnapping checks out. Thank you. - Thank you. - You are under arrest, - for assault of a patient under your care. - What? You have the right to remain silent. - She's sp... - Anything you say can and will be, - used against you in a court law. - I told you, she's special. - You've the right to speak to an attorney. - We have... - a spiritual bond. - If you can't afford an attorney, one will be... "He's not our guy." - What are you talking about? - His alibi checks out. So then, who did this? We're still trying to figure that out. Elle. Elle! Where are you? Elle, I have to tell you something. Elle! Come on, pick up. - What'd you find out? - It wasn't him. - Is Elle with you? She's not here. - No. I was just going to head over. - ''Where's she then?'' - Her car is gone. - ''I think she went somewhere.'' - What's going on? I don't know, but I'm going to find out. - Ryan? - Elle. Welcome back. Why would you do this to me? You know I needed to save you from him. Why do the arrogant asshole think they can have it all? The perfect job, the house, the boss's attention, and the pretty wife? They get everything when they deserve nothing. Ryan, I thought you and Billy were friends. Friends? Did you see how he treated me? He didn't think I was his equal. I was him once. I had the job, the fiancee, a life. But, why would you kidnap me? You wanted him out of the picture. - No, Ryan. I love Billy. - No, you don't love him. You're too good for him. I knew if I brought you here, you'd eventually see how he only cares about his perfect image. No, that's not true. It doesn't matter now. The police don't even believe you were taken. The unexpected icing on the cake was when the cops thought Billy concocted the whole thing to further his career. Ryan, please let me go. I won't tell anyone. We both know I can't do that. But it could still work. Like you said, the police think that it's a hoax. Billy was fired at the paper, he doesn't work there anymore. You can go back there and you can get your life back. And the girl. No. It's meant to be. No. I'll never be with you. You're insane. Elle, where are you? Pick up your phone! Just call me back. We're going to have a happy life together. The cops are going to come looking for me. No one will ever find you, because they aren't even looking. You'll soon realize what I already know. Don't touch me. Help! Help! - Ryan! What are you doing here? - I live here. Guess you never took me up on my invites though or you'd know that. What's up? Elle's car is parked down the street, I was wondering if maybe you've seen her? Here? No. Why would she be here? I'm looking for her. I know she came to this area for a reason. Help! Help! Sorry, wish I can help. - Well, what was that? - Probably my cat. It likes to knock things over. Mind if I just come in for a minute? You can't come in. Elle, keep making noise, I can hear you. You don't deserve her. And now she's mine. Hey, hey, hey. Billy! Take a taste of your own medicine, you psycho! You were supposed to choose me. Got to get up, come on. Elle. The department owes you both an apology. We're very sorry. I just can't believe you guys thought I'd lie about something like this. Hey, what's all this? I thought your return to work deserved a celebratory breakfast. I love you, Billy Johnson. There's no one else in the world that I'd rather spend the rest of my life with than you. - So does this mean that... - Yes. I love you so much, Elle Whitland. I love you, too.
