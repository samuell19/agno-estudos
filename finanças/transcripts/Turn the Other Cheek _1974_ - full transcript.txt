"Illustrious Eminences, I take the occasion of this letter..." "... to denounce the scandalous behavior of two Missionaries..." "... they are destroying what the Church has created in South America." "The two missionaries, Father Pedro de Leon and Father G..." "... are smugglers along the Caribbean coast." "One of the two is always armed with a Winchester rifle..." "... the other says not to recognise any authority..." Who is allowed to slander our missionaries? - This letter was written by the Marquis Felipe Gonzaga. - Who's he? The Governor of Maracaibo, a Catholic of proven faith... ...who contributes generously to our congregation. (Priest) Continue. "I hope in your speech that you put an end to this situation." But where is this mission? (Priest) An island still wild. - Who are these two? - Padre de Leon has studied with me. He was an orphan, mild tempered but extremely powerful. As a twelve year old he shattered his aunt's ribs giving her a hug. At 13 he already smoked cigars. When he opened doors, the handles stayed in his hands. - (Priest) Lord! And the other - (Priest) Never heard of him. (Father G.) Pssst, pssst, Pedro! Father Pedro! Reggie, hold onto Christ for a second. Get up, son. The Professor's watch eh? "Seventh. Do not steal." (Latin) In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hey, good pepper! (Father G. sneezing) We had a good harvest. (Father G. sneezing) - Food's ready. - Thanks. - (Female) When are you coming back? - As soon as we've sold the pepper and the parrots. (Father G.) Thanks. Suits you, Father G... Professor... ...the one with the beard is me. And that's me. - We have been blessed by the gods, we can leave peacefully. - Yes. It's the first time I've seen a sorcerer blessing two priests. I put them under the waterfall and baptised them all. Starting with that witch doctor. - Can you write? - No. - What number did you have in prison? - 7822. - Can you count? - Yes Father. - I want a census of the mission. - I need to know how many sheep in my flock. - Including me? - You last and with a note: Black Sheep. - Yes Father. And do not call me "Father", you could be my Grandfather. He's a funny one. When you're done you can be sacristan. - About that number, 7822... Barra Cosa? - Yeah, 3rd section. Prison numbers don't mean anything. Would you like umbrellas? Okay, we'll get them. - Machete. - Machete, six knives. - Five. Candy? Don't tell anyone what you just saw. - This is what, sorcerer? For the sore throat? - Yes. - What is this? - "Umarasuga". - What? - For the head. Yes. - Cocaine. - Cocaine. No, no cocaine. Professor? Professor Herman, what do you need from the city? If during a trip you encounter a "Celachantus," bring it back here. We'll try the fish market, but can't guarantee anything. Here we are. St. Joseph is now aboard. - This is from my husband, it will protect you from the sun. - Thanks, Baku. You'll scare Professor Herman's prehistoric fish! See you soon Professor, good fishing. How many years has he been looking for that fish? Do you believe his theory that from the fish came the amphibian... ...then the reptile, then the monkey, and then the man? - Have you looked in the mirror? - Yes - Exactly. (Father G.) 30 days and 30 nights floating on the sea... Goods for sale; Pepper for sale and parrots... twenty boxes of candles, parasols, a sewing machine... "If your brother does not peek, if you do not eat a bat..." "... if you do not drink a garganelli, then the bell rings." - If the moon... - The next time the bell leaves. "You can drink a garganelli, if you do not eat a bat..." "Quinine to garganelli, pants for the bat..." Look, you made me make a mistake! Shut up! Look who's making noise! Come here, quick. Who are you? - Let me stay here. - What are you saying? - Escaped from the English plantation? - Yes. - They'll be looking for you. - Yes. - Well, we didn't see anything. - My name is Father G., what's your name? - Oleandro. - Oleandro? What kind of name is that? Are you baptised? - No, yes .. I don't know. For safety's sake a new name will be better. - I'll baptise him? - No, I do the baptisms. - Come on, let me do it. - I am the Head of the Mission and in charge of baptisms. You go man the helm. - Whatever you say. - For tonight? - Every night. - Where are your parents? - I do not know, do not know. - Are you hungry? - Yes. - Baptism then food. - We must change the name. We'll call you Amedeo. Like it? - Yes. Why not call him "G", like me? One day you tell me What the "G" stands for: ...Jerome, Gervasio, Gideon... or maybe Jesus. Amadeo, we baptise you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. "Amadeus" is a beautiful name. In Latin it means "One who loves God." Now eat. "Year of our Lord 1890, Baptism." And with this form... one more. "I baptise with water, said John the Baptist." "He who will come after me, will baptise with fire." In the name of Her Majesty's British Empire I order you to halt! - Wake up! - Anyone aboard. - Amedeo, hide. (Men) Turn to starboard. - (Father Pedro) What is it? - A British patrol. Remove the covers. - God save the Queen. - Why, is something wrong with her? - No, she's fine. So what need is there to bother God then? - Who are you? - Traders international. - Where are you headed? To the port of Maracaibo. - There is no one else on board? - No, why? You have not picked up a native boy? He fled from the plantation of Colonel Morrison. Ah the youth of today don't want to work! - You didn't encounter him? - Who the Colonel? No, the boy who escaped, that dirty bastard. - Have you seen a dirty bastard? - No dirty no one. - No. Maybe you crossed a boat with two Catholic priests on board? A blonde one with blue eyes? And the other big, chunky man with the face of an ape? - Haven't seen them. - Boarding for inspection. - You didn't see the yellow flag? We have cholera on board. - What? Cholera! You said that there's nobody else on board. Who's sick? Can't you tell? Come on. (Men) Oars in the water. Bear to the right. Stay away from our colonies, if you value your health. (Father G.) Since he mentions health, We'll have patients in Santa Cruz. Open wide. - Use this ointment and say a prayer to Saint Anthony. - Thanks. A sore eye. I know an old Indian system to fix that. There. Rub it fast. The witch doctor in the village where I live taught me that. - Now put your finger on the eye. Burns? - Yes. Repeat it 10 times and it will heal. (Hiccups) (Father G.) Hiccups, that's a mental illness. (Father G.) Take a wad dipped in vinegar. Put it here. When it dries, you'll see you've recovered. Let's have a look. You have too many "guests". Cut the "forest"? This? - Do you want to remove it? - It hurts. - Then we need anesthesia. - Do you want one minute or three? - Three. - Count up to ten. - One... Never touch the body with iron. What did God give us hands for? The Company Commercial Center of America... ...that I, Marquis Alfonso Felipe Gonzaga, I represent... ...by the power of blessing conferred by my government... ...the Society of Exports for the British colonies... ...represented by Lionel Steel... ...the Society of Spices Mr. Christiensen represents... Transocean... for the French, and in their name Monsieur Calderon... ...the Society of Spain, in the person of Mr. Fernandez... ...agree to establish new wholesale prices for products... ...as specified. Pepper, cocoa and coffee down from 200 to 100 pesos a bag. The pitcher of pink, nutmeg and vanilla... ...falls from 200 pesos to 100 pesos a pound. (Gonzaga) Do you have the list here. If you agree, sign. - Sir Lionel Steel? - Yes - Monsieur Christiensen? - Yes. - Monsieur Calderon? - Yes - Mr. Fernandez? - Yes. Look St. Joseph, behold Maracaibo, the kingdom of sin and corruption. This is not the place for you. Excuse me, but better cover you up. But you help us just the same and let us do well on the sale of the load. Pepe you've excelled yourself, small, white grains. 100 pesos a bag. - 100 pesos? - We have worked months for the harvest. - 100 pesos! It's for your own good. Gonzaga loves this country and wants to hold down the cost of living. He decided that only he can buy pepper, but at 100 pesos a bag. - Have you all heard? - Go to the cashier. From today onwards, the price of pepper will be 100 pesos a bag. You know how to read? By order of His Excellency, the Governor Gonzaga. (Menendez) Look at those two. Haven't seem them for ages. - I hoped they were dead, drowned. - Stay calm. Do not forget they're priests. - Good morning. Welcome to Maracaibo. - Hello, Menendez. What flows from the mission, Reverend Father? Here you always buy for the Marquis of Gonzaga, is it not so? Of course, Father. What are you Selling? Pepper, cinnamon, coffee? - Pepper. At what price? - Now, 100 pesos a bag. - It's too low. For the missions we can do 150, but don't tell anyone. For us, the price is 150 per bag. - First to offer 150! Nobody offers 200? - 200! 200! I see that the ladies understand. - Who gives me 300? - 300! - 300 for that gentleman with the voice... It goes to 400! Who says 400? I want to hear 400! I'm offering the best pepper in the world! It's an opportunity. - 400. - 400 for the ladies at the bottom. - (Father Pedro) 500. - 500. - (Father Pedro) 600! - 600! - 700! - 700! - 800, 900, 1000! - Sold! - Photography. The miracle of the century. Reverend Fathers, you always have a laugh while you work. - 1000 pesos? Not for gold either! - That's exactly what that is. - If you do not want it, we sell it to the Dutch. - There it will be 100 pesos. We have a monopoly with the English, Spanish and French. - The prices are the same. - We'll sell it to the Chinese merchants. The Chinese merchants are all dead, they died of yellow fever. - It's a gift to the poor. - Jesus Christ be praised. - Always be praised. Go, son, go. You go to the Bird Market. Wait, I am going to sell the birds to the Chinese shop. - Why not send me? - Why? Why do you think. - I won't get the best price because... - Yes, that's precisely why. "Do not lead us into temptation." Goodbye, parrots. Don't say the words you've learned! - Mind the load and don't leave the boat. - Everything's quiet. Take care. - How much? - 32 parrots are 272 pesos. - No, no money. - What would you like for this figure, reverend father? - Let's see... - A beautiful dove for a friend? - What good is beauty to me? 10 rolls of cloth, 30 umbrellas, 300 candles... Two stamps: 200 pesos. What do you want? How are my family to live with so little? Indio, the family is yours, not mine. Brothers, today we read the Gospel according to Saint Matthew, Chapter 18. Today we read the Gospel according to Saint Matthew. Leave it. Be good. - Where's your friend? - He's at home. An attack of gout. Poor fellow. It's only to be expected. Not eating, not sleeping... Won't you understand that we are two priests? We can't marry! "So the apostles asked Jesus:" "... Master, who enters the Kingdom of Heaven?" "'Who will have the right reward for his actions? ". Jesus called to him a child and said: ..."He who is innocent like this child will enter the kingdom of heaven." "He will go to hell, who enriched robbing the poor..." "... and reselling to the rich." - Someone who does not want to appoint. - Gonzaga? - Do not say that name! Why don't you take off that robe and repeat what you just said? No, no, I didn't say it and I'm not hiding behind anything... Why don't you preach in a church then. The church is wherever there is need to hear the word of Christ. Matthew, Chapter 18, Verse 16, Jesus said: ..."The angels decide who is good and who is bad." "Throw the bad" that is you, "in the fiery furnace." "There will be crying without end and grinding of teeth." Bravo! Because you don't pay a fair price? Why buy from us at 1 and sell in Europe for 1000? Ah screw them! The Gospel also says "If your brother refuses to listen..." "... take the others as witnesses." You watch my back. - Why not stop being stolen from? - Mind you own business. You are witnesses, but you don't want to hear. "If your brother refuses to hear then the community..." ...will denounce him, but before that you break his face, understand? Wait, I have not yet finished. What if I do not even want to hear the community, then cash out. Skip to the cashier. Checkout. Checkout. Checkout. Cash out! Checkout. Checkout. Checkout. Checkout. Skip to the cashier. Checkout. Checkout. Checkout. Checkout. Come to the cashier. - You also have the pepper? - 8 sacks and 500. Okay. Tonight, usual place. You have not heard anything. I would also like wire and sweets. - What's that? - It's the portrait of Father G. This is not Father G., this is Jesus Christ. - This is not "Father"? - No, this is the Son. There is a brawl, Gonzaga's men are getting a beating at the store. Out! Get out! - What happened? - I was reading the gospel and they beat me. - And you forgave them like a Christian? - No, I gave it right back. That's not the answer. Remember what it says in the Gospels. One moment, please. - "If you're given a slap ..." - "Turn the other cheek." - Please. - Thanks. But I... - Why did you hit him! - That's the wrong cheek. - What's the right cheek? - Take that. - Get up! See? Violence begets violence. - Addosso! - Liquidiamoli! Now we'll take that robe off! - After them! - Stop! Good work! We can't give justice with our hands. Stop the bum. Pardon, Lord. Oh, mamma mia! Shh! - Where is the priest? - Right, Left, Right, Left! Right, right, right, left! Continue punishment. You know what the Gospel says about someone like you? A moment. I'll throw you in the sea! Back, back, back... - Here. - From here? - Yes I baptise you, sinners! Have you seen a child dressed as a samurai... ...with a rifle, walking upside down? Dressed as a samurai, with a rifle, walking upside down? - This is the last trip you do with me. - You haven't seen him. Holy Mary, Mother of God, take the temptation away from me... ...to send you that crazy man. Let's go to the boat. Sometimes you forget we wear the robe. Where are you going? By the way, the Gospel didn't even mention one like you. Throw him in the water. "The angels will separate the good from the bad." "They angels will separate..." The angels are here! Father Pedro... - Help, Father Pedro! - I have not seen him and did not hear! Hey. Why involve me? Take it up with him! Sorry. Ole! Go away! Help! Slingshot! Way! Way! Way, way, everyone in the water! Not the hand! You're welcome. Idiots! - Father Pedro, the boat! - I was told to go to the boat. - But it's burning! - Alright, so it's burning. It's burning? The boat is burning! - Don't start, you're a good Christian. - So I bless you. The Police are coming. Amedeo, the monkey! - Father! - Father's blessing. - Later. At last we are rid of that old wreck. - Let's swim back to the mission then. - Providence will help us. I was able to sell all the cargo to the Chinese! Work in progress. Now the background. - "Knock and it shall be opened." - Take it. - Go! - Homeland and Freedom! - What? - Hey Mexican! - There is an exit from the stage? - Yes. Are you Mexican? Who told you to knock in that way? I didn't knock. - Do you know if there have overthrown the government? - You're asking me? - So you're not Mexican. - Who told you that I am? He's not Mexican. Someone has betrayed us. - Girls, where is the exit? - Over there. - Monsieur! What's going on? - He says to me? My Lady, I happen to all colours. Monsieur! So you were on a cruise? We did a deal. I understood immediately. I fixed everything with the owner. - That's the owner? - Yes, He's greek. - He's not greek he's a midget. - It works perfectly and it's not a boat. - You see it with your own eyes. In fact it was cheap. He built it for someone at the asylum. It's called Elefante Verde. The engine works on sugar cane. - So you've bought it. - Yes. - And how do we pay? - You want to give me a deposit? - What? - Will you leave a deposit? - A deposit? Maybe. - We will leave a deposit. - What do you leave? - Him and her. - We will wait for 24 hours, then throw them in the sea. - We'll return much sooner. - Now we're selling slaves? - No, we pay and collect Amedeo. - The Lord will help us. - Want to ask a loan? Not from Him but from someone who is high, but not quite so high. (Father G.) We were told that it was very bad, but I find it good. - Your infusion, Eminence. - Thanks. - How's your ulcer, Eminence? - Comes and goes. Thank you. This herbal tea is good. That makes me feel good. We came to talk to you about our mission. - How are things going in the wild? - Good. Tell him the figures. The figures are 77 Confirmations and Communions, 32 Extreme Anointings, ...9 Weddings. (Bishop) Only 9? Why so few marriages? - But there are the 183 baptisms! - 183? Why so many baptisms and so few weddings? There must be... illegitimate births? Because of our work, the couples are prolific: 10, 15 children. Even 28 children. For this, our little church begins not to be enough anymore. - The faithful remain outside. - Poor things! We decided to build a larger one, with a bell tower... ...a great bell, an organ made to make you sing. Good idea, but where is the money to come from? (Father G.) We thought of you and your well-known generosity, Eminence. - No? - No. At least give us the money for the bell... ...for the bell... ...to put the bell? It's your siesta hour, Eminence. I gotta go. All I can give you is my blessing. I give you a fatherly warning: ...Even if you are away from your motherland, your steps are followed. Hold your head high, proud of your poverty. I heard a voice from above which said: "The ring". It's a real ruby. 200 pesos. - Keep your receipt. - Win and redeem the ring. We must redeem a child, a monkey, these costumes and all our money. Now only a miracle can save us. - I'll have a go, 1 game. - I am the Head of the Mission. (St. Joseph, not to say that I speak with you only when I need you... ) (... But the situation is desperate.) (How do we win? You must help me.) (Thank you St. Joseph!) - Rivera, Senator. - Goodbye. - The Senator needs money. As usual he makes his own luck. - Try your luck. - Point 12 on red, Senator? - Yes. Then 12 red. (Dealer, in French) Make your bets! (Dealer) 12 Red! - The Senator is lucky. - Bah he's lucky. (Dealer, in French) Make your bets! I put them on the 12. That's my money. (Dealer) 23 Red. The horse is mine. - My 12... - 23 red. Make your bets!, gentlemen. (Dealer, in French) Make your bets!! (Dealer) 17 black! Ma .. - You! What are you doing here? - I was asking the same thing. I manage this "shack." I see that they finally recognized your innocence. I think so, but I escaped before that anyway. - What are you doing now? - I am in a company with the man with the beard. - How's it going? - It goes. Better here than in the Cayenne. You said it! (Dealer) Zero! - Like zero? Zero is worth something? - Here it is worth everything sir. - Don't lose your cool. - I am here to win, not for fun. You like it? It's the last model. A Derringer 6 and 35 overlapped? Is that what you have? - Cost me an eye from my head. - How much do you want for it? - Well it's a gift if you do me a favor. - A favor? Yes. He believes that faith is enough to win and he needs money. Why don't you let it land on 12 red? - Don't you understand, the roulette is not rigged. - Ah no? On my account that is. How do I do it? Suppose that tonight the Senator won something more... He's a representative of the people. Then put it to representation expenses. Do it for our friendship and for Derringer. 12 red! I won! I have overcome! I won! I won? Like a horse? I won! See how happy you made him? - How much? - 36 times the bet, sir. This is for the ring of the bishop, this is for the boat... ...and now the load. Lord, I commend the load. - Make another win. - What? - He needs money. - 12 red. - I won again. - He won again. - What bravo! - Pay! II quinine, umbrellas, the sweets, the sewing machine... - I do not serve everyone. Please. - Man you are crazy? - No, I am a priest. Father G.? And my father. Dad! - Hey, look at the money. - You have won! - Give me the receipt, I must go to redeem the ring. - Please. - And my gun? - Ah, already! But you're crazy? Now I'll make you eat it. Taste it. You made it with cake and coffee. This is made with cocoa, it's sweeter. Who's that? When we were inside, He beat me at poker 127 times... ...and now I was made to pay all at once. - I want to confess. - Now! - Yes, I have an urgent need. The churches are closed, priests are asleep. You are awake, hear my confession. - (In Latin) absolve you from... - No, I haven't started yet. - It starts well, son. - I have stolen. - What? - This. But as you have won. Yes, with the help of someone friends with a thief... ...who directs a gaming den frequented by thieves. - You know the offender? - Who's confessing, you or me? It's a feeling, smart guy! You went into that casino because you knew that there was a friend. Hope, and St. Joseph helped me. Do not put St. Joseph in the middle of this. - I... - Shut up! There are two possible cases here. First case: Don't tell me what you told me, because you've never told me anything. Did I ever ask what you did before becoming a priest? No. I have never asked since you came knocking at my door? - You don't have a door. - Shut up! What I was told is: "My whole life is a novel." - You want the stories do you? - No, I do not like novels. - So... I absolve you. - I have not yet finished. There is a second case. You have not said why you thought: "This idiot doesn't notice." - That's not so. - No, it isn't. Because I am not an idiot! I'm finished. Give me my penance. Go and return that money to the casino. Indeed, no, I'll go there. I said I am not an idiot! You, however, go and return the Bishop's ring. For penance, go tomorrow at all costs. This is the list. - Made by a wandering photographer. - My God! Our dear friends the missionaries are leaving? - What a beautiful new boat you have. - Thanks. - Do you take passengers? - No. - Sorry, it's all booked. Is it safe, Reverend? - What do I see! Weapons pointed at two poor priests! - He's right. But this is not a poor priest. We embark ourselves. Amedeo, please. You should be at the helm. And we do not eat? - No restaurant on board. - Yes there is. The dish, thanks. - Here. - Do a little fast. It's good for the body and the soul. St Thomas, now a fly gets up my nose. San Clemente, grant me patience. Because if I lose my patience, I must do penance. - Helmsman? - Yes? - We regret we must dock at that pier? I'm sorry, but we're not expecting to stop there. The Marquis Gonzaga wants to talk. Stronger than me. Amedeo, do not turn off the boiler, we'll need it quickly. Wait in the hall. I would give him anesthesia for a month. - Christopher Columbus. - The Marquis Luis Miguel Gonzaga. - Relative of St. Louis? - It's the son of His Excellency. - Why not paint him with the belly? - I paint as I see it. Are you trying to save paint? - The two missionaries my son told me about! - Thanks. My son imports this tea from China. Better if he imported bread, I'm hungry! Please, help yourself. - It's very good, right? - A little bitter. I remember my English friend. He look for five days out the window and said: "I would do anything for a cup of tea, and to kill a Frenchman." Very good this! - His Excellency awaits. - We are sorry, Marchesa. - I invited you here because... - A cigar. - I'll smoke afterwards. Reverend Fathers, you believe in the signs of heaven, right? Heaven has helped me to make a decision in your cases. Sent me... yes, is the right word, a sign. - What decision? - What sign? This. - You know it? - Yes. - Found among the scrap of your boat. - Who gave it to you? - The sea. Four years ago it arrived on the beach of our mission. Four years ago, my ship, had this statue on the bow... ...it disappeared into the sea. On board there were 40 slaves headed to a plantation on the coast. - Slaves? - Former slaves. Children of slaves. Settlers, workers... call them as you like... Even so, my possessions. Now nothing more is known about them. - Perhaps a storm... - There was calm at the time. - Maybe pirates... - Or maybe a revolt on board. They were black people, but bad people who hated me. They had already tried to flee. Maybe they burned the ship. But even so, where are they going to end up? It's a mystery. - It's the will of God. - (Latin) In the centuries of centuries. Amen. You do not know anything, of course. You who travel up and down the coast... you who have a reputation for protecting fugitives and criminals. A bad reputation, Reverend. It's strange coincidence that the statue was in your possession. Just a coincidence. The misunderstanding is clear, let's go. No, you stay here. You will be subordinated to the mission of Monsignor Jimenez. It is a mission founded by my mother, an oasis of peace. You need a spiritual retreat. - We take orders only from ecclesiastical authority. - I know. Monsignor Jimenez, these are the priests of whom I spoke. Show them the letter of the Bishop giving us permission to retain them here. - Who is the head of the mission? - Him I do not know what you did to that holy man the Bishop... ...but it seems that you have combined many troubles. - There is nothing to say. - Yeah. You will have time to reflect. There may return the memory of some strange coincidences. I entrust them to you, Monsignor Jimenez. Leonzio, retrieve those cigars from Father Pedro. In my mission smoking is prohibited. Father Pedro's robe is to be sent for disinfection. In the pockets are two candles and a book. - A trim for the beard? - Look at your beard brother. - What is this book? - The Gospel. - The Gospel? - Yes. A Gospel all torn, missing many pages, stained. Disgusting! A fork, a spoon, powder. As you deserve it! In the time of Father Vincenzino we had a physicist. How are you dressed? The Marchioness sent a Turkey to celebrate the new brothers. We're the brothers. One moment... Before eating, brothers, I have to give you some sad news. Today, three young natives were sentenced to death. Respectful of authority, we do not oppose the ruling. Our hearts cry for them. I begged pardon for them throwing myself at the feet of the Marquis. Not in his capacity as judge, but as a good Christian. That God may enlighten his heart, we will spend the night fasting... ...until an announcement of clemency. - Who were those three? - What does he mean? They organized an escape of workers from the plantation. But you're mad? - I had a vision. - A vision? What vision? I received St. Joseph and he said: ..."My son, these three have received clemency, therefore eat." I haven't eaten since yesterday. Do not joke about this topic. - Put down that leg! - I had a vision. - And I didn't. - Are you sure that you have seen it right? - Yes. Don't you trust in St. Joseph? - Can I stay quiet? - While you eat. - Yes. Brethren, clemency was refused. The young people will be executed tomorrow morning at dawn. We pray for their souls, before dying in the grace of God. - Come on. - Come on. I have to talk to you and St. Joseph. - Where are you going? - To those young people dying in the grace of God. - When will you kill them? - Tomorrow. - Have they made their last confession? - I do not know. I'll find out. - But who is he? - The new father confessor, he comes from Spain. He's implacable, a fanatic. If you want to save yourselves, answer no to any question. - Who are you? - I'm an altar boy, studying in seminary. Saints in heaven! They've never been baptised! - That's serious! - They have never been baptised! - You are baptised? - No. - And you? - No. - Do you not want to die with a clear conscience in peace? - No. - He said "no." But these men are beasts and devils. Here we need to act immediately. On your feet! Get up. - Holy water. Immediately. - And the good priests? - They're praying. - Good Sisters? - At this hour? No matter... - Is the sea nearby. Sergeant! - Drown them. Escort them to the beach, stay out of sight. Soon, before the Marquis Gonzaga finds out! Forward! Buttagli shine the beacon in their faces. Amen. - Thank you, Father. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Go! - Come on. - I forgot to greet the Governor. - What am I supposed to do? - The usual anesthesia! (Father G.) Those kids are saved. Courage. - What happened? - You're dreaming. - He woke up. - Go and see if he's coming. Don't do it. Bye-bye. - Here. You continue. - Yes. May I? You're welcome. (Dear St. Joseph, just because I brought the gun?) (It's not because I want to kill? Kill him?) (I unload it with a sneeze.) As you are now in my mission? We ate so well I remembered... ...about those 40 blacks who disappeared with the ship. Finally! Like some champagne? We must celebrate this visit. What's that, a conjuring trick? - I tried. - You were saying? What was I saying? Those 40 blacks are in the jungle. There is a lot of jungle hereabouts! Do you not think that you could be a little clearer? - What are these drums? - A funeral. For the three criminals who have to be executed tomorrow morning. Already. - You couldn't be merciful? - As far as I'm concerned they're already dead. So where are those 40 blacks hidden? The dead block my memory. Alright. Return when it is released. Yes, yes, come back. Ah, not this either. Father likes the conjuring tricks, but they never work. But now I'll make that glass disappear. To arms! That one. Don't overdo it. - (Man) Who's there? - Use it, do not be afraid. There he is. Thank you. - Have fun? - I toasted with the Governor. I decided to tell you one thing, I can only say it to a friend. Tell me when we are in the mission. - Do you not want to hear my history with Father Clementino? - Shut up. If you won't listen, I ask for confession. - Who is this Father Clementine? - The chaplain of the Cayenne. - So you knew him in prison. - Yes. Here's what it means, "Father G." means "Father Galera." In a sense... - When you got out you thought up being a priest. - No. I was already a priest. You took the vows while you were locked up? No, I knocked out Father Clementino, I put on his robe and I left. I saw that dressed as a priest all respected me... ...they kissed my hand, and then... I have not taken more than that. Take off the robe... you do not need it anymore. Indeed. GET OUT! My new address is written in that bottle! - We go get him? - Father G. is no longer part of the mission. - But where is Father G.? - Where is the Father "Blue Eyes"? Father G. arrives in a few days. Calm, calm! I brought it! Go and get the stuff. - They came with the priests. - With the priests? - Fancy ones. - What do they want? - I do not know. They are armed with rifles. One call himself "Monsignor". - What's your name, boy? - (Father Pedro) Amedeo, come here. - Rivera, his brother. - River. River. Don't trust anyone. All around? Catholic or pagan? Throughout the tour of inspection I have done with our mission... ...I have never seen a pagan civilization so completely intact. Brother, the Church has bred, has trained... ...has sent you here to convert the population to Catholicism. And not to accept their pagan beliefs and their magic. Your task was to baptise these poor people. Have you thought about the material side: To feed them, to make them live better, to buy the sewing machine... They love you because they don't feel advanced but equal to you. Merciful God! Equal! I do not know who to blame, you or the brother... ...that disappeared at sea. I do not know who wanted this human experiment... ...ignoring the basics of religious propaganda... ...the laws of the Church and the duties of the white man... I do not know who is responsible. Who has prohibited the use of money... ...who here has ruled that the way it's done here is all there is... I do not know which of you has been abandoned to this utopia, or anarchy... I take full responsibility, I am the Head of the Mission. You were the Head of the Mission. You will be replaced by two missionaries worthy of the name. All the idols will be destroyed, a real church will be built... ...we will establish the principle that the Church is mistress and not a guest. Of all that I saw... ...of naked idols in the middle of the jungle... ...of this mission made from a wreck of a sunken ship... ...of all this the traces will be wiped out. Of course, our order cannot afford the scandal. You will be returned and I have never come here. I have not seen anything, I have not written anything... I learned by chance that one of the two missionaries disappeared into the sea... ...and the other was eaten by cannibals. So consider yourself eaten and prepare your luggage. We'll see you maybe in Toledo. No. You write what you saw. Write that you know a priest... ...waiting for people to go find it... ...and does not go from house to house to collect debts. This is the only way I do missionary work. Obedience to the order, loyalty to the robe. I'm not wearing the robe, so I no longer have to obey anyone. And I'm not going to Toledo. (Father G.) My new address is written in that bottle. Thus Father Pedro went to find Father G... - Who are looking for? - The owner of this cap. - You know him? - A bit. Come with me. Father G. has returned! - You do not have the habit any more? - No, it was a little tight. I have come to tell you that I have been eaten by cannibals... ...and on your head they've hung 14 judgements from the court at Maracaibo. Fortunately I have received the bottle. Is it not beautiful this cow? Brand new. - Who is this "G"? - Here there is little to choose from. Everything here belongs to Gonzaga: ...The trees, the air we breathe... they too, once. They are 40. This number tell you anything? This is a cow stolen from the Marquis Gonzaga. (together) This is a cow stolen the Marquis Gonzaga. The stolen cow's udders produce the Marchese Gonzaga's milk. The stolen cow udder's produce the Marchese Gonzaga's milk. The milk of the cow stolen from the Marquis Gonzaga... ...is very good because everything stolen from the Marquis is good. The milk of the cow stolen from the Marquis Gonzaga... ...is very good because everything stolen from the Marquis is good. Today we drink this milk to the health of Father Pedro. Today we drink this milk to the health of Father Pedro. I am glad you are here. I need you. Welcome to the community of the 40. Stop. Did you all see? Never hit those more powerful then you and hang around to watch. Strike and get out of there. I did not save myself, but the important thing is to try. Okay, I'll let you off, so we are equal. Right? In a sense... However, you have understood the lesson. Hit and run. This is the only way to deal with those who are stronger than us. Now that I've served your lesson, I can go. Goodbye. Now that Father Pedro decided to stay with us... ...we can go into town and visit the Marquis Gonzaga. During the feast of the conquerors. - There will be the Bishop, the soldiers. - All except me. But there will be the historical disembarkation of the Marchesino Luisito Miguelito. Who is even more disagreeable than his father. Come and see, at least! Wait! (Father Pedro) I have advised you, but I can not make you change your mind. If you persist in hunting trouble, it is unnecessary for you to say: "Help!"... ...because I won't be there. "The coconut falls on the heads of those who are bad and in the hands of those who are good." You are good, stay with us. I hoped it would fall on your head, so you'd change your mind. It's gone bad. - Where is Father G? - I want to know too. It's with great emotion Today... ...a day on which is celebrated the arrival of the first conquerors... ...in the presence of the Marchese Gonzaga, heir of those conquerors... ...I speak to you. They are affected because this morning I had a vision. I received St. Joseph and he said. "Brother, today, at the feast of the conquerors..." "... you have to repeat in public these words:" "... It is said that the Church is the same with everyone, rich and poor ..." "... Because it deals with souls." "'The soul of a poor man, is worth how much then that of a rich man". "The soul of the poor is bad, and the soul of the rich is good."' "'To me all souls are good ." I am sure that the Governor agrees. Little children, what do you need for your soul to be good? Fresh meat? Salted meat, flour, potatoes, beans, poultry, sugar? Faithfully beloved, in this day of joy for all... ...on behalf of the Governor, I say to you... - Do I continue? - Yes, go on Eminence. What is his is yours. Take everything you want. - The flour and rice are on the right. - Viva Gonzaga! The stores are open to all, do not make confusion. We have something for everyone! Stop those thieves! The guards with me. We must protect the governor. Next Swiss. They have him. Father Pedro! Look who it is! A coconut head for the Governor! Punish him! Enclose the Reverend Father in the fortress. - They took him. - And now they'll hang him. It's too bad this time round. Goodbye forever. Do what I said and then disappear. Father Pedro! Permit me, brother? Us fat people have to stick together eh? Forward! Wait. Go ahead it will be a laugh. (Father Pedro) You have elected me your head and I thank you. Remember I am called Padre Pedro. What do I mean by "father"? It means to be one who cares about children. Although sometimes the children would be rather left in peace. I worry that this community lives in a tree. The good God, who is the father of all... ...has determined that in the trees live birds, not men. I do not intend to live on those trapezes that Father G. invented... ...he is not a father, but ignorant of his sons. - Father G... - I have to strengthen father Pedro's tree. - But he said that you'll never get him up here, how can we carry him? Remember that pulley we used when the elephant fell into the pit? - Yes it took two hours. - This will take four. The important thing is the result.
