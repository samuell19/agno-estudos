Are you quite sure you wouldn't rather have them delivered, Mrs. Wheeler? No, that's fine... Thank you, I'll carry them. Then I'll charge them to your account. Perfect. Good day, Mrs. Wheeler. Bye-bye. Hello! Un Momento. Oh, Mrs. Wheeler! Give me. Give me. Thank you, Dolores. Has, uh, Mrs. Cooke come back yet? Yeah, she's upstairs, you want me to call her? No, no. I'll put these in the garden first. You plant you self? Mm-hm. Well, don't. Wait and let Mr. Wheeler plant. Mm, that smells good. Must be for you. What's for us? For you, the meat. Oh, Dolores, dinner at nine tonight. Not eight, not 10, nine. Si, si. Have you ever seen these in bloom? They're like wild roses that bloom. In the country, small and delicate. They're so lovely. In Spain, they're bigger. Oh, I'm sure. In Spain, everything is bigger. And better. Dolores, would you bring the other two. Out for me please? Uh, yes, Mrs. Wheeler. Mrs. Wheeler? Ah, thank you, Dolores. Hello. Hello. They're rugosa, aren't they? Mm, buff beauty. My wife was very fond of those. Always wanted those about the place. Mr. Appleby, what have you been doing. Over there all the time? I'm preparing a bed for some new friends. Of mine. There's no substitute for preparation. You can't just stick things. In the ground and expect them to grow. This soil is poisoned. That damned obscenity. Of a house takes so much of our sunshine away, We're lucky to get anything. - Hello, Ellen? - Hi. Hi... Are you gonna be long? I've got something to show you. What is it? Wait and see. You go in if you like, Mrs. Wheeler. I'll do these for you. Oh, I couldn't let you do that. Besides, the gardener'll be here tomorrow. And leave them in pots overnight? I couldn't bear that. Besides, it would be a pleasure. To do anything for this garden. I played in here as a child. Did you? Your house was my father's. Now I am reduced. To the garden flat next door. Oh, I am sorry. No need. I'm alone now. You go in, Mrs. Wheeler. I'll finish these off. I'll plant them exactly. Where you placed them. Oh, that is kind of you. Actually, ! I am in a... A bit of a rush. You're very kind. Thank you. Pretty woman. Do you know it is impossible to find anything. Anymore, but I've got to get everything before I go. The shops in Scotland are terrible. I've been at it all day. Not quite all day, darling. Except for lunch, of course. They did have another one. With stripes, and I thought it made. Me look a bit like a convict. How did that go? What, darling? Your lunch. I had too much wine. You don't think it's fattening, do you? No, it's very well cut. Well, yeah, I know, but is it fattening? No, darling, it's very nice. Is, uh, Barry going to. Leave his family and marry you? Oh, I don't want him to, I couldn't go through that. What, ruin a good love affair. By getting married? No, thank you. Ah, buenos noches, Dolores. Mrs. Wheeler is upstairs. In the lounge, sir. Thank you. I have decided it's a mistake. Oh, darling. Well, then take it back tomorrow. You're going to be seeing him tomorrow, Aren't you? I don't think so. He's playing golf with his wife. Honestly, I really do worry about. Your taste in men. Hello, darling. Hello, Sarah. I'm sorry I'm late. Panic on wall street. You know, every time the Vietcong launch. A new offencive, I'm late home for dinner. Darling, that dress looks wonderful. Oh, you silly ass, you've seen it. Hundreds of times before. You know I always like to dress for dinner. Of course you do. Do I have time for a drink? How about you, Sarah? Would you like one? It's all right, I have one. Notice anything? Well, uh, you've got a new dress on. Present from a rich admirer? That is none of your business. You know, when I was a young dog, My only interest in women's clothes was. In seeing them removed. Now I've learned about. The finer things. I can appreciate both. What did you do today, my darling? Did you have a nap this afternoon? No, I went out and bought some lovely roses. Mr. Appleby insisted on planting them. Well, that was very kind of him. I'm not too sure. I don't think I'm really going. To fall in love with that man. Well, he seems quite pleasant to me. There's something about him that... I don't know, it... Doesn't matter. I had a chat with him the other day. Apparently, he used to manufacture dummies. For department stores or something equally. Extraordinary. Well, I agree with you, Ellen. Avoid your neighbours like the plague. Oh, absolutely. Now, if your friends, or enemies. For that matter, are living on the other side. Of town, you can see them or avoid them. When you want to. But if you're living next door, it's quite impossible. How long are you actually staying, Sarah? You mean when am I going! The sooner, the better? No, no, not at all. Why don't you stay forever? Ah, it's very sweet of you, but I want to be. In Glasgow on Saturday. I start work on Monday. Oh, let me see now. That gives us, uh, three days. Mm-hm. I must remember to arrange a celebration for you. Why don't we have a party? We can invite Barry. Ah. Yes, well, that's very kind of you, Ellen, But, uh, Barry's not really the sort of man. You could introduce to your friends. I think I'll take this in with me, Shower, and change. Um, what time is dinner, darling? Well, I asked Dolores to serve it at nine. Good, then we'd better be ready by half past 10. Ooh, you started a new jigsaw puzzle. It looks difficult. It isn't really, not once you've seen. The complete picture. I admire your patience. Well, it gives me something to do. When I'm alone in the house. Are you cold? No. Why can't you sleep? I'm an insomniac, didn't you know? Runs in the family. It's not hereditary. Oh, yes it is. My father had... I've been thinking about my father, Trying to understand. What? That's what the watchers of the night are for. Things that in daytime are unknown. And unremembered. Why couldn't he sleep? He was the kindest man. He had all the money. In the world, did everything he. Wanted to do. Wrote bad poetry. Lived in a great house. Was a gentleman farmer. Is it something that I've done? Oh, done? What could you have done, my darling? I can't sleep because I can't sleep. I am beset. By memories and dreams. Oh, I have been so spoiled, haven't !? By him, by you, by Carl. Carl? Oh, I wasn't thinking of him. You mustn't think that. I was thinking of when we first met. And I was. As I was, and you said, "Rest on me. Rely on me." Yes, and I meant that. Did you? Do you? Yes. Oh, hold me. Let's go away. Let's go away. Tomorrow to Greece, Rome, somewhere. In the sun as we used to before... Before I wanted to make my own living. Living doesn't matter, only life. I've lost something, and I want it back. There's nothing lost. You sure? Yes. Yes. Well. I talk too much, don't !? Sorry. Yes, you do. Do you want to go back to sleep? No. It's too late now. I think I'll watch the storm. It's fascinating. I shan't sleep again either. I'm sorry. Can I get you something? Would you like a glass. Of warm milk? A glass of milk. Why not? Love you. Love you. No! Oh, my god, no! No! John! John! What is it Ellen? Oh, john, I think I've seen a dead man! He's been murdered! What? In the old house, the window of the old house! I think his throat's been cut! In the upstairs window. I'm sorry, darling, but I just can't see. Anything and the shutters are closed. Oh, my god. Then someone's closed them. We have to call the police. But it's dark outside, darling. How could you possibly have seen anything? I saw it in the lightning. The, the shutters were open then. Oh, please call the police. Now please calm down. He was... He was sitting in a high wing back chair, And his throat was cut, and there was blood all coming out... Now sit down darling I'll get you a brandy, And then you can tell me again. Clearly and calmly exactly what happened. I don't want any brandy. Will you please call the police, he's still in the house! The police don't particularly appreciate. Being called out at this hour on a false alarm. It's our duty! You may have thought that you saw something. I mean, the wind could have opened and. Closed those shutters. Oh, why won't you believe me? All right. All right! What is the number of that house over there? I don't know. Number... 17 Hanson street, I think. Hello, inspector. I'd like to report a murder. Get a pair of cable cutters. Right, sir. Are you sure they said they were coming? Yes, darling, I told you they were on their way. You know, I always heard the British police. Were so efficient. Here you are, darling. You better take this. Oh, I don't think I should. Do you? I mean !, I have. To talk to them, explain it. Now come on, it'll calm you down. Yes, all right. Oh! I'll go. No, they have to talk to me. I won't be a moment, darling. Oh, god. You all right? Oh, Christ, I've never been so nervous. I've never had to deal with the police before. Yes, you have, Ellen. When? Well, don't you remember? That time with Carl. Thank you, Dolores. I'll take care of it. You the gentleman who made the telephone call? Mr. Wheeler, isn't it? Yes, I'm terribly sorry to trouble you at. This late hour, but... No trouble. You reported seeing something. In the building at the foot of your garden. Actually... My wife saw it. Have there been any other disturbances. Since you called? No, you came very quickly. It's our job, sir. Now, Mr. Wheeler, we've got men. In the front of the house. Is there any other way out of that building. To your knowledge? Yes, there's a back door leading onto our garden. But it's always kept securely locked. Do you mind if I put my men out there? Not at all. Wilson, when you get set up, call the others. And tell them to move in. Dolores, would you kindly show. This gentleman into the garden, please? Yes, Mr. Wheeler. Would you like to come in here, inspector? Thank you. Inspector, before you talk to my wife... Yes, sir. She's not at all well. She's not been sleeping. When you speak to her, inspector, please try not. To upset her any further. Is there something else I should know? No. No, it, it's just that she's been very. Frightened by all of this. I understand. I'll be as brief as possible. Do you think I could have a word with her now? Yes. Please be seated. I'll bring her right down. Thompson, smith, you take a look around upstairs. Let's have a look in here. I saw it all so clearly in the lightning. It's like a photograph burned on my mind. He was sitting in the chair with his hands. Hanging down by his side and his eyes open. And blood pouring down his chest. Can you tell me what he looked like? He, he was fair- headed, tall... Tall? You said he was seated. Well, you can tell if a man is tall even. If he is seated. Yes, Tall and fair-headed. How old was he, would you say? I-!-! don't know. He... He could've been... I just don't know. Mr. Wheeler, perhaps I could just look now. At that window from the position. Where your wife saw the man. Yes, certainly. He was on the first floor, the window. With the shutters. With due respect, Mr. Wheeler, at this distance, And in a flash of lightning, I'd find it. Difficult to be as positive as your wife was. She was quite certain. Are those your men down there? Yes. Have a look in there. Right-oh. Right, then, over here. Let me have that torch. Why are you going on at me? Could it be this, could it be that? I've told you everything I've seen. Could it possibly have been an optical illusion. Caused by the storm? It was a dead body caused by a murderer. Inspector, your men are still searching, Are they not? Quite right, sir. Would you like a drink, inspector? That's very kind of you. What'll you have? Just a soft drink. Nothing fizzy. Some orange scotch and water? That'll be fine. Perhaps the inspector would like some ice, john? I'll get it. That'll be one of my men now. Sorry to have upset you, Mrs. Wheeler. Whatever there was, my men will have found it. This way, please. He's in here. Ah, thank you very much, sir. Good evening. Go on. Well, there's nothing there, sir. The house is a maze of corridors and staircases. We searched everything roof to basement. As far as I can see, nobody's been in or out. Of that house for a long time. That's impossible. First floor, centre window. That's the room. Yes, a big room with a fireplace and some. Odd bits of furniture. Oh, and there's one of. Those, uh, old-fashioned wing chairs. By the window. Then the chair is there. I'm not going mad. And, and was the shutter open? No, it was loose, ma'am. I secured it. Well, they must have moved the body. I'm sorry, ma'am, but there's no sign. Of violence around that chair. No blood or signs of struggle... But that can't be! That can't be! You're not telling me the truth because you... You don't want to upset me. Darling, he must be telling you the truth. You've forgotten. I know what's there. I've s... I've seen it. But darling, I saw them searching. The building myself. Oh, for gods' sakes! I have seen what's there! Now, darling, please! You don't believe me! You don't believe me! - Ellen! - Don't worry, I'll see she's all right. Ellen! Darling, wait a minute, please. Ellen! I'll see you outside. Yes, sir. - Good night. - Good night I'm sorry about that, inspector. Not to worry. Anybody can make a mistake. Have you lived in this neighbourhood long, sir? About six months. And your profession, if you don't mind my asking. I'm an investment adviser. Very nice, too. I've never understood stocks and shares. I don't know anybody who does. That's comforting. You happen to know the owners of that building? No, but I'm told the owners went. To south Africa. I see. Is your wife alone a lot? Not more than most women. We have a Mrs. Cooke staying with us. She's on holiday, they're old friends. Hmm. Well, thank you for answering the questions, Mr. Wheeler. We'll be in touch. Inspector. I wouldn't entirely dismiss the possibility. That my wife saw something. I haven't. We've put a man on to watch the building. We'll be back in the morning to check again. Good night, sir. Good night, inspector. Anything you didn't tell me? No, sir. There's nothing over there. What do you make of it? I make nothing of it. Right now, my guts are killing me, And I should've been off duty two hours ago. Could've been the drink. Or the drugs. Money and menopause more likely. The rich get nervous. What do you want me to write in the report? We'll worry about that in the morning. Right now, I'm going home. Is she in bed? Yes, I've given her a sleeping pill. Do you think that's wise? It'll be all right. John? John? Coming, darling. Good night. John? That chair and the dead body so close. To the window as if I were meant to see it. Darling, don't think about it. Now try and get some sleep. Sleep. Oh, good morning, Dolores. Good morning. Oh, is that for Mrs. Wheeler? Yes. Well, did she ring for it, the bell? No, but it's time. Ah, well, I think she'll be a little later this morning. Wait until she rings. I'll be back after lunch. [Speaking Spanish] Mrs. Wheeler? Good morning, Dolores. Uh, could you come here a moment? Yes. The trees. Were they there yesterday? Oh, yes. No, um, not yesterday. He... He plant this morning. Did you see him? No, um, maybe he plant last night. You want me to ask? No! ♪♪ ... No, thank you. Oh, uh, Mrs. Cooke says she'll be back. After lunch. Thank you, Dolores. Hello? I'd like to speak to inspector walker, please. Here you are, sir. Thank you very much. Forty-seven, please. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Under the trees. Now that's a very interesting theory, Mrs. Wheeler. What makes you think this body is under the trees? There was a trench in that garden yesterday. I know because I saw him digging it. And last night, I saw a dead body. In that house. Now, in the time that it. Took you to get over here... Not more than 10 minutes. Couldn't someone have removed that. Body and buried it later? There were no trees there yesterday. My maid can bear me out on that. The man has the right to plant trees. In his own garden. Oh, god, it's hopeless! There's nothing I can do. I wish I could present you with a body and a man. Standing beside it with a signed confession. In his hand. But I can't! I can only tell you what I've seen. Don't worry, Mrs. Wheeler. I'll be questioning Mr. Appleby. A body in the old house? How very exciting! I saw nothing. When did you plant these trees, Mr. Appleby? Odd question. Last night. Best time to plant anything after a rain storm. The leaves are cool. The soil is saturated. The enzymes are active. I planted them just after you left. As a matter of fact. You knew we were here then. Oh, yes. I wondered what was going on. Do you know anything about trees, inspector? No, as a matter of fact, I don't. They're viburnum Adelaide, graft hybrid. It's extremely rare. A cross between the common viburnum. And the purple-coloured bloom producing. Blossoms of both colours, extraordinary. Do you often stay up all night, Mr. Appleby? Why, yes. Quite often. Sometimes all night. Sometimes all day. Living alone, day and night. Hardly seem to matter, do they? My wife used to say... Do you mind if we ask you to dig these up? I certainly would. Not even for Mrs. Wheeler's peace of mind. You could have a dog sniff at them. It would serve the same purpose. Not quite. You'd need a court order, and I'd do my best. To make it extremely difficult for you. It won't be necessary. Thank you, Mr. Appleby. Mr. Wheeler's office. Yes, Mr. Clyde. I'm sorry. He should be back at any min... Here he is now will you hold the line, please? Mr. Clyde on line two. Put him through. Anybody else? An inspector walker has called. Twice. What have you been up to? Raping secretaries. Get walker on the other line, please. Just a moment, I'm putting you through. Hello, tommy? Yes, I was just about to call you. Well, I've been working on it, and I think I've. Got something for you. There's a new company called, uh, harm on. Yes, harm on, h-a-r-m-o-n, property development. Yes. They are doing rather well, aren't they? Well, it's going up steadily. Let me see now, uh, it was... My god. It's... It's 117 this morning. Tommy, uh, something's come up. Yes, I'll check the closing prices and call you back. All right, thank you. Bye-bye. Put him through, would you? Hello, inspector? Well, what can I do for you? Sorry to bother you, Mr. Wheeler. It's just a little matter of your wife having. Called the station. The inspector told me you phoned him. Four times today, even after he'd left here. He's utterly convinced he's dealing with an. Hysterical woman. And you? No, not at all. Then why do you want me to see a doctor? Tony isn't just a doctor. He's an old friend. Yours. Our friend. If only you'd just see him. Look, whether this thing that you saw... A dead body. All right, a dead body, but that's not the point. You haven't been sleeping. You're nervous, on edge. Perhaps you were right. You should take a holiday. What I suggested was we take a holiday. But darling, I can't. Now please, let's not go through that again. If you loved me, you would believe me. But your first reaction is oh, that's just Ellen. She's off again. Things are happening around here! And all anyone says to me is oh, don't worry, Mrs. Wheeler. Just go to sleep, darling. Don't worry about a thing. It's probably all just in your mind. Maybe it is. Then what about these? Are these in my mind? The police gave these to me after Carl's accident. They disappeared. I thought I'd lost them. I haven't seen them for years. Well, I a... I don't know where the hell they came from. Today, I found them in that drawer. I'm the only one that smokes in this house, I'm the only one that uses that drawer. Carl's things were put in there for me to find. Now it's Carl, is it? Well, where did they come from? Look, Ellen. I'm sorry. A dead body, I can cope with. But your dead husband is too much. Where are you going? Out! To the almost extinct refuge. Of the British male. My local pub. And please do me a favour. Don't ask the police to go looking for me. Going out? Yes. What's happened? What's happened? Nothing. Is she all right? She's found some of Carl's things in her drawer. She claims someone put them there deliberately. Where are you going? I was right, I thought you'd still be up. Come on, here's something to make us both sleep. A cup of cocoa for you and a cup of cocoa for me. Thank you. I never thought I'd be reduced to this. Waiting for my husband. To come back from the pub. It's all right, he'll be back soon. He's just worried and upset. That's all. Oh, what's happening to me? Sarah, I did see that man with his throat cut. And the blood running down his chest. I did see him. Was it Carl? How could it have been Carl? You said he was tall and blond. Carl is dead. Did you see Barry today? No. No, he couldn't. Look, I believe you, darling. I believe you did see something or somebody. Do you remember that time when we. Were first together, when you were ill. In that villa in Monton? You said you saw Carl then. I don't remember. No, probably not. But it's not impossible, you know. It happens to lots of people, people who. Have visions, see ghosts, have hallucinations. If the mind is obsessed enough with something, It can actually produce an image on the retina. It has a name. It's called an eidetic image. I... I haven't thought about Carl for years. I loved him, yes, but that's all over. Oh, where is john? Are you going to drink that? No. Let me get you something else. Sarah. Sarah! Sarah! What is it? Come here. Look. Look! Do you see it? You do see it, don't you? My god, you're right. There is someone there. I'm going to call the police. No, Ellen, wait! Why? Well, it might be the police. Well then they'll know. Or something quite innocent like a... A tramp or... Or some kids or something. Well, they should know about that, Shouldn't they? I'll make sure the kitchen door's locked. Inspector walker? Ellen's seen a light in the old house. Not again! It's there. I saw it too. Where is she? Calling the police. You stay out here. Come on, quick. Get in there. Quick as you can. For god's sake! What bloody idiot. Left this open? You're just a bunch of incompetents. You three in the basement. The rest are upstairs with me. There's a light up here, sarge. Well, get after him then! Yes, sir! Come on, come on! He went round the back, cut him off! He's in the hall! He's in the hallway! Quick, after him! Get up there quick! Get off! Get off! Get off! Lookin' for fertiliser, were we, Mr. Appleby? Put him in the car. Since when was curiosity a crime? This is an intrusion of privacy I cannot. And will not tolerate! Get a carpenter and board it up. Padlock the gates. We'll explain to the owners in the morning. Right-oh. Well, I'm afraid that's about as far. As we can go, sir. All right, then, well hold it there. There's nothing there, sir. - That's it. - What did we expect. To find, Sherlock Holmes? A wax model covered with tomato ketchup? An earthworm with a revolver? I told you last night, it was pure curiosity. If I came to you and told you there was. A dead body in the next house, wouldn't. You pop over to take a look? You could've restrained your curiosity. You had no business in that house. But under the circumstances, We're prepared to drop the charge against you. How kind. We'll have a go and replant them. If you like, sir. You don't replant the dead, sergeant. You bury them! Just get them out of my garden! Excuse me, Mr. Appleby. I'll be very happy to pay for the trees. Will you pay for my trees, Mr. Wheeler dealer? Mr. Stocks-and-bonds, I'm sure you can afford it, Or your wife can! Watch it, you bald-headed nit, or I'll plant those. Trees right up your... Get out, all of you! Get out of my garden! Get out! Get out! Ruffled his feathers. Excuse me. Uh, Mr. Wheeler, just a moment. Yes, inspector? This closes the case. I do hope your wife doesn't make any more calls to the station. It's becoming a big joke down there. This is the kind of thing that wastes the time of the force. I'm sure your time must be very valuable, inspector. So is mine. Good morning. Good morning. Please understand, john. I'm in complete sympathy with you. I know Ellen's past history, And it would seem that there are certain. Latent neurotic patterns which. Might be dangerous. Only to herself. She phoned the police six times yesterday. This morning, she had them digging up. The garden next door for a totally. Non-existent body. Now my neighbour's threatening to sue me. The police have asked me to restrain her. She's hardly slept or eaten anything. In the past few days. She taking the pills I prescribed? Yes. Sleeping pills, tranquilisers, whatever. But they don't seem to help her very much. What worries me most is that she might. Take an overdose. Tony, couldn't you find some excuse to drop by? For dinner, perhaps, for a drink. Just to see for yourself. Yes, I could, but I doubt if it would deceive her. She's far too intelligent. And then whatever confidence she has. In me might be totally destroyed. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid there isn't very much. You can do short of instituting proceedings. To have her committed. Oh, Christ, I couldn't do that. No. No, of course not. And I wasn't suggesting that you should. There is only one thing you really can do, And that is to try to get her to come. And see me voluntarily. But how? Even the police have managed. To persuade her that she's seeing things. And that's because she is seeing them. It's no use you trying to tell her that. There isn't a dead body in that house. What we have to do is to make her accept. The fact that the dead body is in here. And then the moment she begins to mistrust. Her own judgement, she'll be ready to rely on mine. Anyway, try not to worry, hmm? We don't want to start treating you. Not a chance. I couldn't afford it. Of course if she changes her mind, You know where to get a hold of me. And in the meantime, try to act naturally. Refill, Sarah? Oh... Oh, yes. Yes, please. Darling? Anything for you? No. How did it go with Barry today? Oh, we had lunch at the flying horse. In Sidney street. He has terrible taste. Well, he has to have plain food. It's his ulcer. Ulcers and golf. What a combination. You know, this character is becoming increasingly. Unbelievable. What's he going to do when you go to Scotland? Find another girl, I guess. Probably. Plenty of them about. You know, I don't really want to go. The thought of all those pimply faces. Staring up at me. I want to go on an. Archaeological expedition to panama. Or be a croupier at Monte Carlo. Well, why don't you? I might. I've never stayed in one job. Longer than two years. Damn it. If you go on this expedition, what. Are you going to do about the school? Oh, just send them a telegram. Illness in the family or something equally transparent. Oh, dinner is ready, Mrs. Wheeler. Amazing... Quick, we'd better go in. Before she changes her mind. Come on, darling. Uh, you two go ahead. I'm not hungry. Oh, come on. You can't go without food as well. Please, ! I'm not hungry. Oh. Mrs. Wheeler not coming? Just keep it warm, Dolores. Thank you. I could kick myself for making that. Remark about illness in the family. Why is it whenever you're trying to. Avoid a subject, it inevitably creeps. Into the conversation? You could've tried harder. Don't take it out on me, john. I'm sorry. What did tony have to say? He said he couldn't see her without her permission. She's got to see somebody, john. She can't go on like this. You know, I don't think we can go on like this either. Why don't we just go away? Bermuda or somewhere? Your timing is beautiful. What are we going to do about Ellen? What's happened? What's the matter? Ellen tell me. The police. What's the matter? Thr... Throat is... Is cut. What are you talking about? A dead girl in the ♪ ... Window now. A dead... A dead girl in the window. Girl killed. There is nothing there. In my house. Ellen, it is not your house. Somebody's doing something. Ellen. Come on, you can't sit down there. Please get up. Come to bed, darling. Oh, my god. Try not to think about it. Oh, hello, tony? John wheeler. It's Ellen again. I'm afraid so. Well, now she thinks she's seen the body. Of a murdered woman. No. No, we've given her a sedative. She's sleeping now. Yes, but... I'd appreciate it if you could come 'round. First thing in the morning. Yes, I will. Thank you. Good night. A business trip to Spain, he said. But it was Mr. And Mrs. At a seaside hotel near Brighton. The stuff in his suitcase would... Would've dressed. Every whore in Paris. She was half-naked, and he... His... His... Clothes were open. And her head was in his lap. Her neck was broken, but her face was unmarked. Blonde. Only a child, dead, and she was. Smiling at me. Carl. In the mortuary, They tried to make them decent; hide it. From the loving wife. They couldn't even keep. Their hands off each other at 80. Miles an hour. There was more lipstick on his clothes than blood. Yes! Yes! Yes, he is my husband. He betrayed me! That's the thing I can never get over, never! It was a long time ago, Ellen. A very long time ago. It seemed to matter more than his death. What are you doing? Prescription. You've nearly finished those. What is it for? Tranquilisers. I think somebody is switching them. I think I'm being poisoned. Those don't make me calm. They make me feel ill. Somebody is doing something. Who do you think might be doing something? John? Oh, no. I'm not paranoid. You... You can't make out that I'm paranoid. Sarah? Sarah! W... We went to school together. We're best friends. Sisters. Why, she... She was my matron of honour. When I married Carl. Ellen, are there any other reasons why you. Should have Carl so much on your mind lately? I am being made to think of Carl. W... Why do you think I found his lighter. And cuff-links in that drawer? H... Th... Things are happening that you. Simply cannot explain by my state of mind. Can't you see that? I'm not trying to see anything at the moment. I'm just listening. No. You're being blind and stupid. Stupid! There was a dead body in that house. There've been two dead bodies. In that house, and there's someone. Over there now watching me. All the time, watching me. Ellen, please now, take it easy. Calm down. Come and sit down. Come and sit down and listen to me. I don't want to listen to anyone anymore. You trust me, don't you? Of course I trust you, tony. Then listen to me. For your own sake, I don't want you to spend another night. In this house. If there is a murderer, then you should leave. For your own safety. If there isn't, then you must. Still go away for a rest. You mean a clinic. I know an excellent place, it's more like a hotel. Than a clinic, most of my patients. Have been very happy with it. Would it be for long? No, no. You need... Just need a rest. Care. A month or two at the most. All right, tony. Whatever you say. Good. I'll just go and have a word with john. I'll be back. How is she? Well, she's not very well, I'm afraid. But I did manage to persuade her to go. You know, there's something about her behaviour. That wasn't there before. Yes, I know. Anyway, one thing is certain, john. She must not spend one more night in this house. I know a very good place in Switzerland. It's run by a German doctor. His prices are a bit steep, but he's. Very well-qualified. If you can make the arrangements, I'll make sure she's on that plane tonight. Good. I think it's absolutely necessary. Inspector, th... There... There's a doctor here, And... And they're planning to send me away. That's why you've got to believe me. There's... There's been another murder, a... A... A young woman. Yes, of course, Mrs. Wheeler. Yes, I'm writing it down. She's seen another one. When was this, Mrs. Wheeler? It happened last night. I told you. You're the only one I've got left. You... You're the only person that can help. Oh, won't you please search that house again. It's hor... Horrible that... That. Th... Thing lying over there. Perhaps you'd like to search the building. Yourself, Mrs. Wheeler. I can give you the name of the owners if you like. W... Who are they? I... I th... I thought they'd G... Gone to south a... Africa. It, uh, it was bought six months ago by a. Company called Dipco. Of course, the address. It's 39, 39 alt cross road, London w1. Thank you, inspector. I shall get in touch with the managing director myself, And I'll hire a firm of private detectives. To go through that house. But private detectives are really no good, are they? Oh, won't you please come yourself? Please. Please? Yes, Mrs. Wheeler. We'll be over there as soon as we can get there. Of course. Y... Y... Leave it with me, Mrs. Wheeler. We've got it all in hand, and we'll. Be over there as... Yes, indeed. Bye-bye, Mrs. Wheeler. Bye-bye, Mrs. Wheeler. I don't know what we'd do without her. Make it a cup of tea. Be back at nine o'clock and don't be late. My wife's got a plane to catch. Very good, sir. Finished packing, darling? Yes. The rain won't matter much once you're. Off the ground. You know, it's amazing how quickly you can leave. This English soup behind and have nothing. But the stars for company. Is Sarah joining us? Yes, I think so. We can't have a farewell scene without Sarah. You don't mind her coming with us, do you, darling? Her plane leaves half an hour after yours. Not at all. Darling, ♪... Before she comes, you wouldn't mind Signing these papers, would you? What are they? Oh, tax matters for the most part. You know, one spends more time paying taxes. In this country than making money. And the others? Share transfers. Purely technical. I had them prepared by your accountant. And lawyer this afternoon. These? Power of attorney of some of our joint. Holdings, ones that are in flux. Things I might have to make a quick decision. On without the time to consult you. John? Yes? Are you sure you want me to go through with this? With what, darling? Going away. I don't want to. It's for the best. Glaxo, idv, harm on developments, I didn't know we'd bought into that. When? When was it now? Um, oh, offhand, I can't remember. I'd have to check back with your accountant. In the morning. I've seen their statements, they seem to be doing. Terribly well. Was anything the matter? No. I need a pen. Oh, here you are. On the number one line. Uh, have you seen Dolores? I wanted to say good-bye to her. Well, don't you remember? She left today. You fired her. Did !? Sarah told me you had. That's odd. I... I don't remember. But that's why I'm going to Switzerland, isn't it? Right, I'm all set. My bags are in the hall. Here you are. I've brought you a tranquiliser. I know you don't like flying any more than I do. Thank you. There you are, john. Thank you. I'll go and get your bags downstairs. Come on. Where's the tranquiliser? In there. I dissolved it. You know I don't like to take them that way. Well, it's the last one in the bottle. It was flaky. I've taken so many pills. Perhaps the last one in the bottle. Is the one I shouldn't take. You'll need it later, Ellen. Uh, h... How long will it take you to get. To Glasgow? Hour and a half. By way of Bermuda? Don't look so surprised. I found your ticket amongst your things. I've given up the job. I suppose I was. Too embarrassed to tell you that! I've decided to go away with Barry. Why should you be? I suppose it's because I've always made. Such fun of him. I'm sorry I lied to you. A lie is such a small betrayal. Well, that's done. The car shouldn't be too long. Plenty of time to have one for the road. I hope you'll be very happy. Ellen, you're shaking. Now, don't be silly. Come on, now. Drink this. Isn't she considerate? Thinking of my welfare even now. My old companion. My dear friend. Doesn't she do it well? She's very fond of you. Oh, and of you, too. Oh, I don't know about that. You know very well. Are you Barry? Are you the lover she's been meeting? Now, don't be absurd, how could! How could you indeed! Play the oldest and dirtiest trick of all. Ellen, I swear to you, of course I'm fond. Of her just as you are! God, how you must hate me, john. To sit here with that woman in the same room with me. Holding that secret over me like a knife. Loving me, pitying me. Knowing all the time I was making. A goddamn fool of myself! She means nothing to me. I love you! Does that make it better or worse? Ellen, you're imagining all this as well. Keep away from me. I had you followed. I know. And every night, I made you tell your. Filthy lie, and now I'm to drink that so I go. To sleep and never wake up. My body's to be left in that old house, Dark and boarded up. Ellen! I found her ticket, where's yours? This is madness! It is not! Please calm down! It was a beautiful plan, wasn't it? You worked it out together in bed. In the long afternoons in some stinking cheap hotel. Well, she's half mad already. All we have to do is just push her over the edge. You knew about Carl's things. John, you better ring tony. We can't do any more. Nothing you haven't already done. It was cruel of you to use Carl. Even to make me think it was Carl. It was always Carl. Carl in your imagination, Carl in your dreams. Never me, that's your sickness. That's why you're going away, To get over that, finally and forever. Sarah is not important to me. Please believe me. You liar! You lie! There is no plot against you! Liar! What's this, then? I found this key today. In your desk, and the label says Dipco. We own that company, and that company. Owns that old house! I found that out from inspector walker. I don't know how it got there! I don't know anything about it. You bought that house to drive me mad! And this is how you've been doing it! It isn't true. It isn't even possible! Well, let's find out. Let's find out right now! John! John, don't go, she's mad! John! John! I've got to stop her! Someone could get hurt, let me get a doctor! You... John! John! John, don't do it! John! John! She... John? Ellen? Ellen? Ellen? Where are you? What the hell! John! John! For god's sake! John! John! Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Inspector walker, please. Inspector walker speaking. Inspector, you... You... You didn't send anyone. And you promised to! I... I... I have something to tell... Y... Y... Yes, ! I... I am. I... I... I'm... I'm going. In a few minutes. Inspector, there're. Two bodies in... In that building now, A man and a... And a woman sitting s... Side by side with th... Their th... Throats cut. Yes, ! I know, but you must believe me this time. Please. W... Won't you in... Ins... Inspect that house. Just once more? Then... Then someone else. I always thought you'd say that. Bravo! Bravo! Superb. Superb performance. Plan complete in every last detail. Pity you had to include my viburnums. Sorry about that. How nicely you've done the house. This was three rooms when I was a child. Beautiful. Quite beautiful. I do love Indian art. Erotic. Violent. So charming. Will you be away long? At the moment, that seems to depend. On you, Mr. Appleby. Oh, Mrs. Wheeler, inspector walker. Wouldn't believe me either. I do admire you. How many abandoned wives. Or cuckolds for that matter. Would've had your courage? I, myself, did nothing. It's a great favour to ask you, But since you're so fond of this house... Yes? Would it be possible for you to take care. Of it while I'm away? And the, uh, garden too, of course. It'll be a pleasure. I'll see that nothing's disturbed. Thank you, Mr. Appleby. Thank you, Mrs. Wheeler. Oh, would you be so kind? Of course. Thanks. Goodbye, Mr. Appleby. Goodbye, Mrs. Wheeler.
