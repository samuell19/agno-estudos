An ANIMA FILM Production The Son of the Stars Created by Mircea Toia based on the series The Final Mission Animation by Scenery Image Special Recording Music Sound Montage Redaction Assistant Director Production The series The Final Mission was directed by From somewhere in the galaxy, the Argos rushes to Earth Eight Earth years ago, Roxana and Alex left their home planet to go on a research mission. During this time, their son, Dan, was born. The Earthling's first steps take him to the hundreds of machines all over the ship. So, at a very young age he masterfully controls the toys his father builds for him. Dan's knowledge grows progressively between Mom's stories and what he learns from the big computer, BOB. The way back to Earth was going well until the Argos reached the Van Kleef Belt named after its discoverer. Over a vast portion of space, among tens of stars and their planets there are strong gravitational storms which have destroyed numerous ships and their crews. And, during an ordinary night, the alarms on the Argos went off. Mom, I'm scared! Alex, what's happening? I don't know yet, look after Dan. The controls are locked and I have no access to BOB. - And the displays? - I don't know who is controlling them. It's an S.O.S message from the gravitational belt. ...Andra O'Neil... ...the Van Kleef belt... ...with the purpose... sixty-four seventy-six with the coordinates... That's impossible! You know that nobody makes it back from there. And still... Wait! I'm back online! ALERT! ALERT! INCOMING S.O.S from the Van Kleef gravitational belt. Did you get it, BOB? Received. Fixed distortion. Quickly, show us! This is Andra O'Neil, the pilot of CRONOS II. I crash-landed on an unknown planet beyond the Van Kleef Belt. The dashboard calendar shows the year 6476. I cannot determine the coordinates. I don't understand. An unknown planet? What sense does it make to mention the year? What sense does it make?! You must have heard of Andra O'Neil. Andra O'Neil - Class IE pilot. Born in the year 5620. Twelve intergalactic flights. So, is Andra 850 years old? Correct. We need to follow the message wave to get to her. Before we lose the connection. - Alex, what about the belt? - There's a passage the message is coming through. - You're not asking me to leave her there?! - Dan has never seen Earth. We'll make it. It's a unique opportunity. We have to! The Argos changes its course towards the gravitational disturbance zone, crossing the meteor cloud which guards The Van Kleef Belt. Although the ship is run by the most advanced computer built by man, the disturbance in this area makes her flight awkward. Look at the main display! The message is being broadcast at a galactic scale. Directional engine damaged. What a blow! I can only control it from outside. I'm taking an intervention shuttle. Wait! I'm coming with you. Program BOB. If anything should happen to us he must steer the ship to the nearest habitable planet. The rest of the engines will do. - Do you think...? - We have no choice! - Finally! Let's go back, quickly! - I can't! The controls are stuck. - We're losing contact with the ship. - We must talk to him! I can't do it. You try, please! - All right. Don't cry. This is your father. Stay calm. We'll be gone for a while on a research mission. You are big now and you understand more. Be good and listen to BOB. - My boy! - BOB, what was that? Do you understand anything? Nothings, boy. I will always be by your side and teach you many things. But first let's settle somewhere. The Argos lands in the jungle of an unknown planet. Once the ship's vibration stopped seeing the unusual world outside on the screens, Dan asked BOB to open the outer hatch. BOB, open! I want to go out! Dan, Stay! Wait! You must grow, you must learn. Dan, Stay. Don't go. Your parents are not on this planet. Don't go. Twelve Earth years passed, Dan grew up and learned how to use telepathy to communicate with the strange inhabitants of this planet. One seemingly ordinary day, the earthling is called to the Judgment Cave. Unnamed One, since you have been among us, Doreea, the planet you are on, has made twelve turns around its sun. In this time, not only did you learn to speak with your thoughts but you have also developed other powers. The time has come to find out if you can take care of yourself. Thus, The Elders' Council wants to put you to a test. Watch me carefully, Unnamed One. This is The Council's Torch. You must light it. The test is not over. Follow me. The crystals you see come from my imagination. I shall destroy them, and you shall rebuild them from your memory. Now, the Hunter's test! Unnamed One, prove your strength and your skill! A zamp. I think we made a good choice. The Unnamed One can take care of himself. He is fully worthy of the Hunters' Badge. I ask the Council if it's now the time to reveal the great mystery. The unnamed One will barely make it without us. I shall prove it to you. Look at this stone and try to collect your thoughts. Focus. Think of yourself. See? He couldn't do that. You asked us to hide his true identity. We very well know only he could do that which we cannot. We hid it from him to protect him from the shock. All right, Skyl, we'll think about it. Unnamed One, you may leave. Outside the Judgment Cave the Doreeans prepare a celebration as once the hunters arrive, The Unnamed One will receive the badge. Come close, Unnamed One. Receive the Hunters' Badge you have rightfully earned. Unnamed One! Where are you going? - I'm going hunting. - Let me come with you. - You're too young. Like you didn't hunt before you got the badge. All right, but behave. - Aren't you glad you got the Hunter's Badge? Now you can sit in the Elders' Council. Oh! I haven't been on this path before! Hey, look! Can you see something? - Fallen akon trees. - They're poisonous! We can't touch them! I'll take them out of the way, don't worry. Come on, help me. I'm too small! But you have the Hunter's Badge! - Use it. - You're right, I'm not used to it. I can't go on! Can't you feel that? I do. Only that it's calling me. Stop! The forbidden zone starts here. - I must go. - You can't. No Doreean could cross it. The elders say a star fell there. Maybe. But I feel a calling. Stay here or go back if you like but don't tell anyone I crossed the border. I must see what is out there. Welcome, Dan! I have been waiting for you. I knew you'd come back and here you are. For the first time in 12 years Dan heard spoken words in a language he tried to remember. Dan, come back! Come back, Dan. I waited for you! Don't go away again! Come back, Dan! I know, young man. You, Unnamed One, have learned a part of the Great Mystery. I don't need to hide anything from you now. Look, unnamed One. The Judgment Cave is nothing but the ship on which we, the astronauts of the planet Kama got stranded on Doreea, whose prisoners we are. All attempts to escape have been useless and we wasted all our fuel for nothing. Unfortunately, we can't use Argos to power our engines. A huge force which we feel all the time manifests in the area terrestrials call The Van Kleef Belt. A bending of space or perhaps a distortion of time. Only you can help us. That is why we've taught you everything you know. Try to escape and bring help from Kama. Days and nights went by over the planet Doreea. On his home spaceship with BOB's help Dan remembers spoken language and learns everything a galactic explorer should know. One day we will return home to the blue planet which is truly wonderful. Dan! In your friends' camp I detect unusual activity. I don't have enough data. You two stay here. Unnamed One, do not be sad. We have been prisoners on Doreea for millennia and to extend our lives we went into the slumber you, terrestrials, call anabiosis. You were raised by our projections, a sort of toys meant to protect and teach you. Now that you can care for yourself, our captain, Skyl, who thinks you incapable of helping us has commanded us to abandon you. But I am sure you will save us. So, go to the fourth planet of the neighboring star. They're waiting for you. After the Doreeans' transformation Dan is restless. He must leave Doreea at any cost and connect the dots on the fourth planet. The Argos is broken And cannot be started. So, Dan sets out to build a new ship. - BOB, I need to talk to you. - I'm listening. Since the Doreeans turned to stone, I've had something on my mind. Why didn't Little Bu turn to stone? He was protected by the screens on Argos. The same screens that wouldn't let him cross when you first found the ship. One more thing. I grew up with them And Bu stayed little. Of course. As No explained, The Doreeans were in continuous anabiosis, a state that preserves the body. I understand. Another thing. I want to leave this place. Any idea? We must build a new ship. The gravitational belt is a trap for traditional ships. We'll use different principles to build one. Like? A bionic ship whose controls are an extension of your senses. And so started the building of the ship The Flying Dutchman named after an old Earth legend about a sailing ship that transcended the limits of space and time. It is ready now. The ship whose controls are activated by your mind is ready. You can control your energy and that makes it twice efficient. All right, BOB. I can unplug you now. The transporter will take you to the new ship where you will reconnect. - Done, BOB, respond. - Connected. Perfect. We leave tomorrow. Head to the fourth planet of the neighboring star. She's waiting for you... WARNING! Structural changes detected outside! Time-Space abnormality. Time leap. Impossible to set coordinates. Bu, Fibo, where are you? Where are we? - Dan, Where did you go? - I wonder that, too. Give me the coordinates. We beat the phenomenon with a 3 second deviation from the galactic reference. Great job! The ship did amazing! Only a few contacts are out. Bufi, Bu, don't worry. I'll be right back. There must be an entrance. Stay here. Guard the ship. You read my thoughts. So, you come from Doreea? That's Impossible! You shouldn't have come here. Indeed, the Doreeans have sent you. No said you would come and free us from captivity. Forgive my mistrust. I had to put you to a test. I also owe you an explanation. Here, you are also on a spaceship. The whole planet is a craft that took us through the galaxy and I, the last of one of my crew have fallen into the trap of the radiation belt. What you call a Van Kleef belt or barrier acts like a rational being. Your experience is to confirm this assumption. You can be sure I'll scrutinize it, Knight. Come and I'll show you. The crono-mobile is the heart of this spacecraft. A time traveling machine. The Knight and Dan travel through time and visit the capital of the planet A big an, as well as the rocky region from its past. The planet Dezira during its war era. And, finally, the deep sea of the planet Fezial. Back. Take me back. Awful experience. For now you have begged the crono-mobile. You must be able to command it. Also, none of the trips were real. What do you mean? They were merely my mind's projections. You forget that we are trapped in this barrier or whatever it is. But worry not. The crono-mobile will help you for real. - Are you saying...? - Yes. I am giving it to you. I am the last of my kind. There's no other way, so it's best I stay here. Thank you, Knight. Goodbye. Try to get to the center of the belt. There is a wise man who will help you. Look! The crono-mobile is floating. Finally, I caught it in my bio energetic field. Lying machine! You're useless! Dan can't control the crono-mobile. Discouraged, he tries to come back from his failed time travel. You're tired and discouraged. Relax, this is only the beginning. Who speaks? That being which the Knight suspects. Where are you? Everywhere. Around you, inside you. In the time that flies and in the stars. - So, this is what you look like. - And an infinity of other ways. - Aren't you afraid? - I am. That won't stop me from fighting you in the names of those you keep prisoner. Do you want to free them? Beware! You are no match for me. Haw? You can recognize me. How could you defeat me? With the ship, the crono-mobile, my Hunter's Badge, and all my friends. Try it. Face me. But I warn you. You will lose everything. Crone-mobile, I command you to take me to the ship. WARNING! WARNING! There are 1450 battleships approaching. - Coordinates: - That will be all right, BOB. I shall please you. You may fight me with all those prisoners you want to save. Thus, the intergalactic pilots trapped in the Van Kleef belt start communicating with each other. There's our people! The Doreeans! Unnamed One, you did it! - Are you prepared, earthling? - Yes, Knight! Welcome! We must not fail. Now, you can all guess who trapped us. We must join forces to free ourselves. You have your wish. Fight me and you will lose. YOU WILL LOSE. We can't do it, BOB! Split up! The crono-mobile! You have your wish. Fight me and you shall lose. YOU SHALL LOSE. Without his friends or his ship, Defeated by Van Kleef, Dan floats through space protected by a shield of his own energy. Welcome, earthling! I've been waiting a long time. Are you starting to remember? That's right. You fought and you lost. Leave me alone! I am your friend. An old friend. Who are you? They call me the Node. The Knight told you about me. The Knight is dead. They are all dead. If I were you, I would only have one goal. Revenge. Your opponent is incredibly strong but it's also vulnerable. Who did you say you were? The Node. They call me that because I connect the prisoners. Gathering their thoughts and hopes as they wait for freedom. Each one of these caves is a communication channel to another world. Why are you telling me to fight again? Because Van Kleef can be defeated. It isn't inside the belt, but the belt itself. An unknown entity which appeared many cycles ago taking over tens of stars and their planets, making them into astronaut traps. Space-time mazes nobody has been able to escape. Not even by death. Their lives and captivity became endless. You tell me lies, Node. Such a being cannot be defeated. It can. And the prisoners can be saved. If you go back in time and fight it before it kills them. - Fight alone? - You are not alone. I am hereto help you. Wherever you go, you shall find me. Protect yourself! You are on the planet Retania and the fire is real. You can't escape it! Run back! - Where? - In space and time! Outside the cave before you went in! I don't know how! Remember the crono-mobile! Unbelievable! Excellent machine, the crono-mobile. As you were learning to control it, it transferred its powers to you. All you needed was to make the first leap. Now you can travel to the past or future, what more do you want? The Hunter's Badge, to harness my powers. - Isn't it...? - It seems like it. Take it and see for yourself. Node! I'm falling! Help! I don't have to, see? You're floating. Going up. How did I do that? The power of the Hunter's Badge is inside you. You don't need to wear it. - You're joking, Node. - Try it. Amazing! The Flying Dutchman transferred its powers to you before it was destroyed. Do you still feel helpless and alone? I see you have the same powers. Why haven't you fought Van Kleef? Why haven't you freed the prisoners? You see... Like the rest, my ship wrecked in the Van Kleef belt. That was a long time ago. I was inexperienced. It was my first flight. Everything on this planet was so unusual that I got really scared. I was caught in a trap where matter was in constant transformation. The ship went first. Then, I suffered a mutation which helped me survive. Now, I keep changing my shape in the wildest ways imaginable. Are you surprised nothing happened to you? That proves you have qualities which I did not. I discovered this crevice while I was being chased. Finally, I realized that the alveoli could store information. I contacted the others and studied the whole Belt. As I learned more, I realized I can not be away too long from the planet I am energetically connected to. That is why I can't fight Van Kleef. Come here. I will teach you everything I learned from spying on Van Kleef. Turn yourself into a planet. Or into a blade of grass. Scatter like stardust and come back together. Hide in the middle of a Sun. Multiply a million-fold and always come back to yourself. Node, isn't this too much? All of this was given to you on one condition. To be and to always stay human. Until the end, no matter what. Don't forget the fight is near. Do you like it? I'll gift it to you. Wear it close to your heart like the heroes in your stories. It's an energetic trap. The only one that can capture Van Kleef. Hey, Van Kleef! Where are you? - Who's calling me? Oh, it's you, earthling! Yes, It is me. I come to get revenge. - Mkay. You've traveled back in time. Let's see how capable you are of wielding any weapon. After defeating Van Kleef and freeing the prisoners, Dan is ready to look for his parents again. This is Piesara. The vicinity of this planet is where your parents got lost. Argos intervention module detected. Your parents are alive. The sensors are detecting their presence. Who are you? I am from Earth and my name is Dan. Dan! This is my story. I must find Andra too, and then, we'll all go back to the blue planet I have only seen in BOB's holograms. I haven't heard from Andra since we received the S.O.S. The module was rendered useless and we could never leave this area. The dashboard is broken. ALERT! S.O.S message! Re-transmission This is Andra O'Neil. This is Andra O'Neil, Class IE Pilot This is Andra O'Neil ...S.O.S Message... This is Andra O'Neil BOB, trace the source of the message ...IE... ALERT! ...S.O.S. re-transmission... ...This is Andra O'Neil... ...IE Class Pilot... This is Andra O'Neil, Pilot of CRONOS II. I crash-landed on an unknown planet beyond the Van Kleef Belt. The dashboard calendar... Robot, what happened to your owner? I don't know. MALFUNCTION. S.O.S. ...This has been the... ...recorded... ...don't know... - You're here? - Why not? I was freed too when you defeated Van Kleef. I hope you will follow and destroy it. I am not going to follow it. I realized late that war, fighting is not the best way. If I had known that from the start I wouldn't have risked the lives of those who fought by my side. Here's a secret: Nobody was in danger. They were all spatial projections. How do you know all this? I have been by your side until your final test. What test? Imagine highly evolved beings wanted to communicate to their kind, what would they do first? They would check if the other beings are ready for such a contact. And there is your answer. You passed the test because not once did you think to use your powers to control any of the worlds you visited. The others would have done the same. They all had qualities. But none had them all, like you. Maybe it's because you were born among the stars. Node, who are you really? I am the one you have named Van Kleef. A messenger from a far away world which for millennia has tried to contact other worlds. The fear of hostility, that our knowledge will be used for destructive purposes - have made us thoroughly test those we communicate with. So, time... All the time before I came here... Yes. Time stopped for everyone who waited for you to pass the test. The immortality you imagined... Nobody has that. Only our actions can be immortal. - One last question, Van Kleef... - I know, I know... I have long owed you an answer. Andra is alive. With her, you will complete your mission. Voice Acting Animation Image Assistant
