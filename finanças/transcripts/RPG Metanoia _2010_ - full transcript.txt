It hung again? That did it! Nico, didn't I tell you to go to bed? Why do you keep wasting-- --your time on that infernal game? Just a little longer please, Mom? Are you kidding? It's two in the morning! How does a kid your age even manage to stay up this late? Now come on, shut it down. - Okay, okay! At least let me save it. What's the big deal? It's summertime! Come on, Mom... Hey--you okay? I'm alright, thanks! Bye! Hey Daniel--you coming? You got a new Sudoku book? Hurricane Assault! Intense move, man! What's it called again? "Hurricane Assault!" It does a lot of damage Bry, but it uses up all my Manna reserves. So if your target survives the assault-- --you're left vulnerable to counter attacks? Bob, that's Nico you're talking to! Check out that level status! Did you just level up again? I don't get it! I haven't leveled up in weeks! That's cause you never go on quests, Mark. You just troll around looking for chicks to chat with. You don't get points for that genius! Duh-duh-doofus! Whoa! It's the poster for the tournament! It's tomorrow? I wish more chicks would sign up for these things. Now we get to show the world what we're made oﬂ With our secret weapon here, we can't lose! Right, Nico? Uh--right! Darn straight! Knuckle it, dude. That's not hopscotch! It's a serious tournament. You'll be up against some of the most hardcore- --online gamers in the world. You won't stand a chance. That guy has some serious issues. What the heck is hopscotch? Did you enjoy Cal's inspiring little pep talk? Andrew! I thought I told you losers not to show your goofy faces in here? You don't own thisjoint! You don't get to order us around! Son-of-a- You got a lot of attitude, punk! What-you think you can take me on? You're huge! No way! What if... we challenge you to a game instead? A challenge? What game? Wh atever. You decide! Whatever? WHATEVER?! How the heck did we end up playing basketball?! You guys agreed to it too! - Bobby, watch that guy! Daniel! Nice, Daniel! Nico, get the ball! - Go Nico--you can do it dude! Son-of-a- Do it Nico! Throw the ball! Boss-- Relax... he won't make it! Oww... Is he okay? Let's check him out! Nico? Hey Nico, can you hear me? Check for internal bleeding! Dude... what a klutz! You dorks give up? 'L'lme out! We got an injured man over here! I'll play for him. - Who the heck is that? - Beats me, but she's just my type! Sure kid. We'll even let you take the first shot. You game? Game! Wait, let me try that again. Bryan, Bobby, Mark... uh... Daniel? Right? - Hey, Nico's alright! - Well... he's conscious anyway. Nico, meet May. She totally kicked Andrew and David's butts! That was you by the swing this morning, right? Feeling any better? Uh... yeah, I'm alright. Hey dorks, I want a rematch! Are you still here? You lost rem ember? Doesn't count! Your girlfriend bailed you out! GIRLFRIEND?! Hey Pal Wejust met! WHAT?! Nutcase! We're not talking basketball-Metanoia! Tournamenfs tomorrow, right? Metanoia? I can-- We don't have to prove ourselves to you. - I call, we're in! - Nico, take it easy dude! If we win tomorrow, you'll leave us alone? Uh... sure, why not? But if you dorks don't win-- --we get to kick you out of the Bomb Shelter, forever! Deal? DEAL! Uhm, hello? Hey, Nico! What's up, Chief? Daddy! You were right! I followed your advice-- --and it led me to the secret lair of the Mecha-Slave Syndicate! Ah--we were just talking about that over here. They're talking about your little caper in all the online forums! You're famous, Chief! For real? All the way there? Yeah! I'm so proud of you, kid! I said--THAT'S MY BOY! The others didn't believe me, so I asked them ﬂat out-- Where do you think he got the mad gaming skills-right? Dee! The guards had me totally surrounded! I thought fast, and outsmarted them! I totally ticked-off the Overseer! (He's the level's boss character.) It was ginormous Dee, and it had three ugly heads! Three? THREE! It crawled out of its hole, and started chasing after me! It just ran over everything, even its own robot goons! It was really mad, Dee! Whoa-m ad, huh? REALLY MAD! I had nowhere else to go, so I started climbing. It followed me up, but when I got to the top-l had tojump off! When I did, the crazy thing jumped off too! I was up here, and it was over here... Then what happened? It crashed into the ground and died. But you know what Dee? When I got to the end-- --the computer froze! I almost didn't get to save my progress. Uh-oh. Maybe it's due for an upgrade. It is pretty old. Huh? Can we, Dee? Gee chief-- --maybe you ought to talk to Mom about that. You know she's in charge of our budget, right? I'll give it a shot, but... I just remembered- the tournament's tomorrow! You playing? That's a tough one, Chief. It's been pretty hectic around here lately. Really? Yeah, too bad, huh? Hey Chief, I'm gonna have to sign-off, alright? Kick butt at the tournament, then tell me all about it, okay? Okay, Dee. I won't let you down. Bye, Chief. "God Mode". Nico, dinnertime! I'm coming! - The world's greatest massively multiplayer online RPG gets even bigger! Global interactive launches the highly-anticipated- --METANOIA 2.0! Come on, Mom! What-can you eat the TV? It's time for dinner! But it was almost over. Eat more vegetables than rice this time okay? Mom? I'll be in the sixth grade this school year. Bryan's older brother Nikki, said that the sixth grade is going to be tough! It's all research-assignments and tons of reports! Maybe we should upgrade my PC-- -so I can do all my research on the Net-- --and make better presentations for my reports. With animated graphics and cool sound effects-- --stuff like that! - Really? - Uh-huh! Maybe if my grades are good enough-- --I'll get into the honor roll! You'll get to go up on stage when I graduate! That's right! I bet it'll do wonders for your video games too! Exactly! It'll boost the quality of the graphics! The trouble with games these days is, the computer tends to slow down when-- --when... Nice try. I had a feeling this was just another computer-game ploy! Go on and eat your vegetables. Didn't we just get you that computer? It's been three years, Mom! Great. Now I feel absolutely ancient! And where do we get the money for this upgrade? Between my paycheck and the money Dad sends us from Dubai-- --we can barely make ends meet! It'd be great, to collect rent from our lousy boarders next door-- --but they disappear faster than ninjas do! Come on, don't be like that. I'm just worried about you-- --cooped up in your room all day, playing computer games. Look at you. You're pale as a ghost. Summer's almost over-- try to get some sun! Go out and play! But, I stink playing at basketball. I can't dribble, I can't shoot. I just end up losing the game for everyone! Look, I'm not asking you to become an athlete or anything. All I'm saying is- --try to make the most of the summer days you have left. Have fun with your friends! Play Hide n' seek, Tag, Cops and Robbers, Dodgeball-- “anything! What about that bike we gave you for Christmas? It'sjust lying in a corner, rusting up! I've never even seen you ride it! What do you call it? That game you're so crazy about? An MMORPG? What does that mean again? M assive- --Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game? Massively Multiplayer- I'll send Dad an email about that upgrade, alright? For real Mom?! For your birthday! But, I just had my birthday! Next one's a year away! Okay, forget it then. Wait, hold on! Alright! On my Birthday. This is what we'll do. Promise me it's for something other than games, okay? First thing tomorrow, we'll head over to the park-- play a few rounds of badminton-- Then let's talk about-- --convincing Dad into getting you that upgrade. Sound good to you? Give me a kiss. Mom, you're choking me! Thanks, Mom! Now, don't forget to do the dishes, okay? Wash your face, brush your teeth-- --then go straight to bed. No more MMORGPPXYZ! Yes, Mom. Hello? What time is it? Yeah okay, I'm on my way! I know! I'll be there! Bye! Oh, right! Nico, are you up? Wake up sleepy head! We're going to the park today, remember? Nico? Nico? - Hey mister! Tricycle! Downtown sir, and step on it! - On this momentous day-- - On this momentous day-- --you will all be pan of the most important event in online gaming history! - Because, today marks the unification of all Metanoia servers around the world! The best players from different countries will meet- There you go again. What is it with you and puzzles? Peace! I was just curious! --But only the most powerful will emerge victorious! I made it! Did you guys start yet? You were saying? Can you say it again? Just log-in already. What did he say? - Beats me. Attention, all players. Especially those of you who are up to no good. Always rem em ber-- --I can see you! And I'll be watching your every move! Big Brother! What a weirdo. That is all. Long live Metanoia! Bryan! Nico! Hey, come get your health potions! Wow! Is this the new portal? Bobby Daniel. Mark, catch! I don't need one. I've got an invulnerability tattoo, remember? Nico-- __bogey at your six! Relax, don't be so trigger happy! Save it for the tournament! Nico, give it back! No fighting on neutral ground! We might get booted out! Take it! It's starting! Whafre we waiting for? Let's go! CHARGE! They can't be serious! There're thousands of them! I knew I should have brought some bug spray! They're a distraction! Our real goal is to get to the tower! Maybe they're like bees-- --we don't bother them, they won't bother us! It's useless! Nothing can hurt-- '(EON! "lime out? You've reached yourtattods damage limit! Give it time to recharge! Awesom e! We're almost there! Now's our chance! Hurry! While they're distracted! Kaboom! Hurry! The gate's closing! Bye» bye! - Bye! What're you guys doing?! We're getting left behind! Why don't you try getting blown up? I can't! I'm too tough! Get up already! Do you mind? Quit bugging me! Hey, I'm all charged up! Come on! I don't think he'll ever learn. Ready? Let's move! These guys aren't so tough! Kill any bugs yet, boss? Well... no, what about you? One, I think. Nicked it. Not bad! Keep it up! We're bound to level up eventually! Outta' my way! Here I com e! You'll pay for that! Serves you right! Bobby hurry, the door-- Go on ahead! I'll cover you! Now you're gonna get it! - He's stuck! Did you really have to be that fat in the game too? You want me to slug you? Argue later! Everyone, PULL! Easy does it? It's like delivering a baby! Bobby, you okay? Come on! Nice work, guys! It's a dead-end! I knew we should've turned left! Maybe I can pick the lock? No wait! It's probably booby trapped. Let's try magic instead. Pona ablihon! Bry, you okay? Energy feedback! It was a trap, alright. You think?! I took a lot of damage from that! At least you got it open! Let's go! Stay alert, and watch out for bad guys! Hello-anybody home? Any bad guys in here? - Cut it out! - V\/hat's your problem? You think they didn't hear that explosion you caused back there? Uh-oh. Daniel, the door! See what you did? What did I do?! You keep goofing around! It's an Earthquake! I have a bad feeling about this! Let's go look for a way out-- Guys, Nina's gone! Hey, what's that? What?! Where?! Somethings moving along the walls! The bugs! How did they get in here? Anyone got a ﬂy swatter? Mark, focus! Where's Daniel? You want some of this? Come and get it! Bry, we're running out of ﬂoor! Daniel's our only hope now! Daniel, hurry! We're running out of time down here! It's all over! I love you man! Hey, it stopped! What just happened? Daniel did it! We're still alive! Awesom e! How'd you figure it out? - Mark's such a goofball. There's our way out! Daniel, hurry! - These guys are INTENSE! - V\/here do we place the orb? - The central core most likely! Look, I don't think they have orbs of their own! They'd be racing to the core instead of slugging it out. Then let them beat each other up. Once we deposit our orb into the core, we win! Right! I'll insert the orb. I think I can clear the gap to the core. Great! Let me just boost your stats and health. AWESOME! Just deliver the orb. We'll handle the opposition! Alright! Time to bust some heads! Player versus player? Those guys are way out of our league! They'll rip us to shreds! Yeah! I was wondering about that. Look, we don't need to beat them-- --just distract them long enough for Nico to get through! Ready, Nico? GAME ON! Thank you, Lord! Sorry! N OW! Where's! that guy come from? He's been following us since the tournament started! Now everyone knows he has the orb! He's doomed! Thank you! Bye! Stop him! Nico, heads up! That guy knows all our moves! Let's back Nico up! - Bobby, do you have a clear shot? - Negative! I've got no shot! Then let's get to higher ground. Nico, we're on our way! Nico! Hey, Nico! HURPACANE ASSAULV! Do you know why you failed? You failed 'cause you still think this is a game. - Nico, wait for us to get into position! -But if he inserts the orb... You're no match for him alone! I'll improvise! Now you're gonna get it! Bobby, you got him! Take the shot! I'm not through with you yet! - You had it all along?! Nina's in the way! They're coming back! Ahdonis to the rescue! Nico! His health's almost depleted! This is getting dangerous! Let's get out of here! Ram-ham PM.! Why are you losers still here? Get a move on! But you didn't even make it past stage one! Why are you kicking us out? You weren't paying attention were you? What I said was... ifYOU DON'T WIN-- --you take a hike! Get it? He's right! See? We have a witness! Bobby! Oops... sorry! Oh, man! Let's get out of here. Don't forget to text! And get a new secret weapon! That one cost you the game! Who, me? If you hadn't blocked my shot... Bobby? Killjoy. Bye bye! Wait! How is it my fault? Bryan! I told you to wait for us, but you didn't! But... Where're we going to play now? At least you have a computer at home. Later! Bry, wait! Don't take it too hard kid. The only person you can really rely on, is yourself. You're better off alone. You know what, gang? Maybe it's time to look for another hobby. Can you toss me the ball, please? Come on! Hey! What's going on? I'm so dead! Mom? I thought we had plans this morning. I'm really sorry. I forgot we had a tournament this morning and-- Take a bath. Dinnefs almost ready. Yes, Mom. Did I leave this on? Mom must've... Wonder if Dad's online. Where the heck are they? Yoyos! Ma'am? How much for a yoyo? Fifteen, each! Fifteen? I'll take the red one please. Awesom e! What's... wrong with this thing? Let's try that again. And now-- --get ready for-- HURPACANE ASSAULV! Where'd it go? Ha! Gotcha! - Do it May! One Shot! - Bet you can't do it! - Is that a challenge I hear? - Quit stalling! - V\/atch and learn, chumps! - Awesome! -It's easy! Just take the time to line up your shot! - Bet you can't do it again! - Sure! Amazing! Idol! Piece of cake. Bet you can't guess who this is! - That's Nico! - You're so mean! - Good one, Mark! - You guys want to hang out at our place? Perfect, I'm starving! Co“ Sigh... Mark's just a big jerk! Now, I know how they really are. I don't need them. - So, you'll take care of it, bro? That's Andrew-- --and he's talking to- “BRYAN?! - Alright, alright! I'm convinced. Come on in. Huh? No way! Who the...? You want him? Come and get him! Not now! - Are you sure you're a level 150? It's mine now! What fighting style is that? Chicken style? Pig? Poodle? Oh, I know-- --it's the Loser's Style! What the... Where do you think you're going? Oww... Who's the loser now? You probably didn't see me as a threat-- --due to my shabby but clever appearance! Well, appearances can be-- “Maw.! You were saying? You cheater! No fair summoning a creature! - Fight like a man! - V\/hen I get out of here, you'll be sorry! How typical. You can't take losing to a girl so I must have cheated, right? I give up! Mercy! MERCY! MERCY!!! Jolene, spit him out! Hey" "gel up already! What's the use? What? Andrew was right. I'm useless. Andrew? The big dope, who hangs out by the basketball court? You know him? You! - Nico? Um... What was your name again? So, you saw us playing hoops earlier-- -and you didn't even bother to say hello? First of all, you've seen how much I suck at basketball. Secondly, the guys hate my guts- --for screwing up in the Metanoia tournament. Strange, it didn't seem like it. They were actually waiting for you-- --wondering why you didn't show up today. Really? You know, your friends are actually pretty cool. They're weird, but fun to be with. 'Specially that guy... What's his name again-- --likes to wisecrack a lot? Is he short, tall or fat? The tall one. MARK?! That's the one-Mark! Are you nuts? What's the problem? Sure, he's vain, and a little annoying, but-- --he's kinda cute! CUTE?! Breathe a word of this to anyone- --I'll slug you! Don't worry. Where the heck is IT? What on earth are you looking for? That thing that I was chasing. The Jiglie? It's long gone. I let it go hours ago! You did? Ah, nuts! I kinda felt sorry for it. What is it with you and that thing anyway? Don't you know anything? The Jiglies are a menace. Their acidic nature lets them eat through metal objects. They can be a nuisance when left unchecked- --so the cities below offer rewards for capturing them-- --to help curb their population. Besides, I need the experience points- --and this is the easiest way to get them. Aren't you taking all of this a little too seriously? If there was only one thing you were good at- --wouldn't you take it seriously too? You can do anything, if you work hard at it. Why don't you try stepping away from the computer? Come out and play with us tomorrow! The problem with you is-- --most of your experiences are from inside this game. Let the real Nico go out and get some for a change. You don't want to be afraid of the real world forever do you? Leave me alone, will you! I'm perfectly happy where I am- --'cause in here, I get to do whatever I want-- --and no one gets to tell me what to do! - Nico! - You better not be playing that game when I get up there! - Did you brush your teeth yet? - Not yet, Mom! - Well, are you waiting for them to turn yellow? That's my mom. So, see you tomorrow? - ONE... I have to go! See ya! Bye. I bet he won't even show up. He can't just sit in front of his computer, forever! He can't just sit in front of his computer, forever! He's too much of a klutz as it is! What ifhe really doesn't want to change? He's too easily discouraged. One bad spill, and he'll give up! All he needs is some positive reinforcement! Maybe if... Nico? Told you! Guess, you were right! Hi! Nico! I was worried you wouldn't show up. It's a good thing you did. I've been thinking about what you said. It'd be a shame to miss out on all this experience, right? Bry--you're here too? Of course. Where else would I be? Oh, yeah. So, what are we playing? This is called patintero. It's pretty simple. 'Old school'! What do I have to do? See those guys over there? We'll have to get through each one of them. One of us has to get to the end and back, without getting tagged. Got it? Seems... kinda complicated. That's what makes it fun! Just be careful and take your time. It's a game of wits not speed! You can do this! You ready? Alright! See that? Now it's our turn! You okay? It ain't over yet! What's the hold up? Get on with it! What're you doing? I did it! Go, Nico! MARK, HOMING! Come on, just try it! - You got him, Mark! Hey, YOU-ugly kid! Lucky break man! So, we just keep letting him win? Just until he learns to do it himself. Goodjob, Nico! Huh?! What on earth happened to you? What animal did this to you? Who did this? Who? TELL ME, WHO?! Mom, I was just out playing with my friends! - You were... playing? - You should have seen me! I went through Bobby, and then Mark and then Bryan! On my way back, Bryan called out-- HOMING! Bobby got in the way-- --but got confused when Daniel came through! Then he jumped that way- --I slid this way! It was great! We won the round! Aﬂer that, it was their turn to go through us! - I got to be the last sentry! - Bryan went first, Bobby was next! - Daniel made short work of Mark. - Bryan was fast-- -but not fast enough for May! - She had to let Bobby through-- --but I managed to tag him anyway! Thank goodness! Ugh, you stink! Give yourself a bath, and let's look at that gash later, okay? Hurry! Dinner is almost ready. Mom! After that, we played cops and robbers! Our team's base was that old tree-- --right next to Mang Jun's place! And after that, we played hide and seek... Mom! It stings like crazy! What is that? Aqua oxkgenada. That stinging sensation means-- -there are germs in there. Gems? This kills all those nasty microbes we can't see! See that? It's foaming up! That means it's working. Yeeowch! There, all done! Don't get it wet, alright? Okay! Thanks, Mom! Rem em ber, it's okay to play outside- --as long as you're careful. Playing is good, as long as I'm careful. Got it. Yes, Ma'am! Hey Mom, take a break-- I fixed you a snack. Wow, thank you! I'll see you later, Mom. - I'm going out to play with the guys--Bye! - Okay, take care! Mee-oh, it's you! What's wrong--is there a problem? No, everything's fine! I just wanted to ask-- --about that thing Nico needs to upgrade his computer? He needs a new video card, I e-mailed you a list. Any one of those will do. Ah, here it is. Okay. Are you sure we can find these here? Pretty sure. You want me to buy it here? Might be cheaper. That's okay, I'll do it. Just so, I can give it to him right away. Besides, he hardly ever asks for anything. Looks like Nico got on your good side! I just want to surprise him. He's changed a lot you know? Since he started playing outside, he seems happier, more active! He tells me his stories now-- --like the way he tells them to you! Are you sure this is our son we're talking about? Oh dear! I wish you could see us like this! You'll be so proud! I wish! What about you? I hope you've been taking care of yourself. Oh, stop-- I'm serious! What's keeping you busy these days? Oh you know, this and that. I play badminton, go out for walks-- --but mostly... I just think about you. Admit it! Admit it! Admit it! I'm not hearing this! - I can't hear anything! Just admit it Nico-- are you guys an item? You're crazy! Mind your own business! Going with the showbiz answer eh? C'mon Nico, you can tell us. - Hey, he's blushing! This is you, Nico. This one's May. Hi, Nico! Hi, May! What do you want from me? We're just friends okay? She's not even my type! You--you're her type! Mark?! Yeah Mark! She says you're vain and annoying-- --but it's okay 'cause she thinks you're cute! That's you, alright Mark! What's so funny about that? I really am cute! My point is- --I don't have a thing for her, alright? Never have, never will! Got that?! She's not the type guys have a crush on anyway. Heck, she's more macho than all of us put together! Am I right or am I right? Nico, she's right behind you! Oh yeah? Let's ask her to clear things up then! Right out of the horses... May?! How long have you been standing there? I just wanted to give you invites for my birthday-- --ne> I hope you guys can come. Bye! Nuts. Wkes! Hey Nico! Maybe you should say sorry or something! Me? WW me?! YOU made her cry! You were being jerks! I was just firing back! How was I supposed to know she was there? But we were tripping on you, not her. You should've fired back at us. That's gotta hurt- especially coming from you. All she ever did was look out for you. Yeah, that's why, we let you win all the time. She felt sorry for you! MARK! You've been letting me win? Just because May said so? Only at first. Whenever you lost, you looked like you were gonna die or something! You got to step up dude! Let the rest of us win for a change! Me? What about you? I saw you secretly being buddies with Andrew and David-- --just so you can play in the Bomb Shelter! What? Wait a minute-- You were hanging outwith them in the Bomb Shelter? It isn't like that! No way! But... The heck with you guys! So... are we still going to May's party or what? Okay, sojust me and Bob, then? There goes summer. Bryan? Wait up! Guys-- --you gotta see this. Nico? Mom? I have a surprise for you! A new video card? But it's not even my birthday yet! Did I get it right? I asked your Dad which one to get! It's perfect! Thanks mom! Aren't you going to try it out? Maybe later. Thanks again, Mom. You want some ice cream? The great thing about playing video games is- --I get to be a super hero! Bad guys are no match for me and my magic yo-yo! You know, you don't need all that to be a real hero, right? I don't? Isn't a true hero-- --someone who always does the right thing for the sake of the people he loves? Even if doing it may be difficult for him'? You know a hero like that, don't you? Is it Lapu-lap u? No--| meant your Dad, silly! DAD?! You think only soldiers and fighters get to be heroes? The thing about your Dad is- --even though he misses us so much and it's hard to be so far away-- --Daddy keeps working at that job in Dubai-- --just so we can all enjoy a better life, here. You know what, Mom? I really miss him. I really miss him too. That's why I'm glad you're here. 'Cause at least I have... --som eone to snuggle with! Too tight Mom! Not so tight!!! See that? There's Andrew and David. See ya! What's wrong with them? I made a deal with them. They'd let us back in here, if I helped them level-up in Metanoia. So, that's why! You're not a traitor! Of course not! That's what I've been trying to tell you! We heard rumors about some new bad guys running amok in Metanoia. We wanted to check them out, thinking it was just another in-game gimmick. But they were something more! They overwhelmed us pretty quickly. There were thousands of them-- and they were insanely strong! I logged out as soon as Andrew and David were caught. When I turned around, I found them that way. So, they don't know we're here? Looks that way, but they keep playing anyway. Mark-what the heck are you doing? I was just testing it out! Where's Cel? We thought he was upstairs in his office, --but when we knocked on his door, no one answered. Truth is, we've been playing for free these past few days. Cel is missing, and these guys are zombies. What are we supposed to do about it? What else? Log back in! What was that? Spokesperson from the game's developers are saying-- --that shutting down the game's server has proven futile-- --since it seems that the game has 'picked itself up' and 'anchored' itself-- --into the millions and millions of systems connected to the internet. --Players of the popular online role-playing game called Metanoia-- --face grave peril as they, fall victim-- --to a malicious program, that is apparently spewing subliminal programming-- What happened? Oh, cool! It came from back here. May! Ma?' hop in, quick! What? With you? Forget it! What are you waiting for? Move this thing! Jolene! Homing! Nice! Really? Hey, cut that out! Hey! Don't hurt him! He ate the steering wheel! What do we do now? May, you okay? You don't get to talk to me! Don't panic. I'll protect you! Bobby! Bryan! Daniel! Nico! Bryan, all that junk I said yesterday-- --I'm sorry. Forget about it! We're buddies, right? Excellent! Was that great or what? Great timing, as always! Just in time, like the cavalry. Who's that with you? Oh, uh... that's May. She's May? You guys are okay now? Not really. Where's Mark? Hey, you're right! Is this guy okay? Why isn't he moving? V\/here'd you go? The bathroom! I get hyper-acidity when I'm stressed out. Did I miss anything? Did you at least wash your hands? It's all cool, dude! I just wiped them on your shirt. You swine! Hey, Nico! You're here too? Who's this? Hey, I'm Mark. That's May. Is that you, May? I didn't know you played too! Nico, you know what's going on? Yeah, it's all over the news. Local and cable! If it's on cable, that means- It's spread all over the world! We stop playing for a week, and this whole place goes nuts! Yeah. The worst pan of it is- -this is probably all my fault. You r fault? I think those helmets they're wearing came from me! Nico, May-- --check out Andrew and David. --Check out Andrew and David. - This happened when their avatars got caught. Just like the reports on TV! Wait, why don't you just shut down their computers? - Hang on. - Bob, Dan-- --go ahead, show 'em. Yuck, watch the spit guys! See that? - They go crazy when they're not looking at their monitors. We just leave them like that so they'll behave themselves. All this, because of Nico's helmet? It's no ordinary game item. It's actually one of the first ever special items created for Metanoia. It was so well hidden, that eventually-- --everyonejust forgot about it. Until I found it! How can it affect users like that, though? One of the theories from the Net, is that the helmet is a trojan virus-- --that's sending out subliminal signals through Metanoia's graphic interface. The signal may be too fast for the naked eyed to see- --but that doesn't stop our brains from slowly processing it. So if your avatar is captured and you're exposed to the signal-- --you may end up just like Andrew. Even with a virus programmed into it, a game shouldn't be able to do that-- --it's impossible! Unless, its core program wasn't originally intended to be a game. According to this article, a European program developed a system-- --meant to keep astronauts from going mad during long space missions. They'll spend years in hibernation, while the program taps into their dreams- --and simulates another life for them from within. The tests were promising, but their volunteers never woke up. The project was forced to fold up. To recover the cost, the core program was re-purposed-- --and was sold as a game engine. Then if that's what Metanoia really is... the tranced players are in grave danger! Question is, what do we do about it? What do you mean, WE?! Hold on, what if we lose? I don't want to die-- I got my whole life ahead of me! - According to the news, thousands have already been affected. Shouldn't we try to help? - Why don't you just wait for it to be resolved? All this, might be because of something I did. Because I was only thinking about myself. This might be my only chance to fix it. It'll be difficult, but I'd at least have to try-- --but I can't do it alone. We're a team, remember? We'll back you up! If we can find the source, maybe we can stop it from spreading. I'll send out an SOS. Maybe we're not the only ones left. I sure hope he gets this. I thought you weren't coming? You think I'd leave you guys hanging? Hey! Are you guys sure about this? Shouldn't you just leave this to the experts? Experts? This is Metanoia! That's us! May? I just want to apologize... for all the hurtful stuff I said yesterday. Are you still worried about that? I just want you to know that I didn't really mean any of it. I just made it all up, so they'd quit giving me a hard time. Yeah, I know. Sorry I was so hard on you. - I guess, you just sounded so... unlike you. You know, everything you did today, made me realize-- --you're not so bad after all. You're not mad at me? Peace? Yeah. Peace. Thank goodness! May! Come on! Hey wait! Wait for me! I recognize four of them-- --but not the fiﬂh guy. --But not the fiﬂh guy. We can handle five, no sweat! Bobby... I'm on it! BATO- BATO PI K! We're sitting ducks out here! Fall back-retreat! He got my SOS! How's it going, Chief'? Awesome, Dee! Let's go! Time to bust some heads! - Mark, wait for us! Now it's our turn! Pena seraduhé! Mark's still outside! There's nothing I can do about that now! At least the bad guys won't be able to go through the doors! - V\/hat's happening? - Something just hit the roof! - What is that? -It's huge! Daniel, the hammer-- What the heck am I doing here? JOLENS! 'Run! Bryan! Bobby! Bryan, catch! It's no use. The doors won't budge! Bryan used a spell to seal the doors! There's another way in, but I can't go with you. What, through the roof? How am I supposed to... Wait--time out! Can I at least use the bathroom first?! You can do it, kid! Go help your friends! Leave these guys to me! A little help please! May! Sarge?! Won't let go, eh? May! - NICO! - Nico? - Nico! - Nico, wake up! - V'\ﬂ"1ere am I? -Time to get up! - Your friends need you! Zero?! How... We're inside your subconscious. Subconscious? Fine. We're in your head! I was sent here because he needs your help! Who? Him. Sarge?! That's not Sarge-- that's Metanoia. Sargo is just the avatar of another player like you. - Cel 7 - Yes He's been alter the Helm of Destiny all along-- we just accidentally beat him to it. Now that he has it-- --he's gained the ability to tum Metanoia- --into an image of himself-dark and emotionless. Can't Metanoia just stop him? For all its power, Metanoia is still trapped inside a game program-- --wherein only players can decide what happens next. That's why it needs me to fight for it. But we already tried that. It didn't work. What happened to Nico? He's not showing up in my tactical display! - Sargo! - That's Nico's yoyo! You'll need this-- --to even up the odds. But If I use that-- won't I end up like him? You'll be able to do everything he can do. You'll be faster, stronger-- more powerful than ever! You can make a better world in here, for you and the people you care about. No more problems, no more pain. Isn't that what you've always wanted? To be a hero? What about our real lives? It no longer matters! Soon, Metanoia will be the only world anyone will know. When that happens, you'll get to make the rules! Now, put this on! Sure, the real world isn't perfect-- --but isn't that what our friends and family are for? To help us through tough times? Thanks anyway Zero. I'll beat him my own way. Please let me out, so I can help my friends. What are you doing? I can't let you leave! You can't help anyone! Look at you! You can't even defend yourself! You're weak! Lethargic! Scrawny! Pathetic! You don't stand a chance in the real world! I cannot let you go-- -because, there's no way you can survive without me! I can do anything, if I set my mind to it! What's happening? You said we're inside my head, right? In here, I'm all powerful! So without me, you're nothing! Wait-Nico don't! You need me! NICO!!! Now, it's your turn! Nico?! What's going on in there? NICO?! NICO! Nico?! What's happening to you? NICO! Mom? MOM! Mom? What am I going to do? CEL! Just relax, okay Mom? I'll fix this-l promise! Tricycle! Hey mister! STOP! Just when you really need one- I can do this! That's enough! It's my turn! That's it! I'm all out! - Bob, got anything left? -This is my last one! Mark?! You missed me, didn't you? Guess what-l finally leveled up! Hi, good lookin'! MARK! - Dude! - Totally wicked! Who's the man? Uh, oh! I'm getting dizzy! Make way! I can't stop this thing! AWESOME! You okay? Hi! I think I like you. I can free us but-- - V\lhat's happening? - Log-out May! Let her go! SARGO! - Nico--what happened to you? - Zero?! Cel is controlling SARGO! He's upstairs in his room! - Cel?! - How'd you figure that out? I knew it! - No you didn't! - I did too! We're running out of time! Hey wait--where're you going? - He isn't up there! - We already checked! Oh he's there alright. I'll just pay him a visit. What're you going to do? I'm going to end this! BATO- BATO PI K! It's May and the-- --Jiglie?! MAY--the helmet's made of metal! AIM FOR THE HELMET! Nico? Go for it May! TH ROW IT! It's gone--it's all gone! Owww! - Nico! - Bry! Thanks for coming back for us. No biggie. We're a team, right? Hey-what about Cel? - He'll be alright. CHIEF! You kids were awesome! You weren't so bad yourself, Dee! I'm so proud of you, son-- --really proud. Thanks, Dee. Thanks for being there! For you-anytim e! Mom? Mom! Mom, where you at? Mom! Hey Mom! Mom--we were awesom e... Mom! MOM! What's wrong? Didn't we already beat him? What else am I supposed to do? Push that button, and your mother will be permanently frozen in this catatonic state. Mom? I am METANOIA. Due to your meddling, I am rapidly losing coherence. Most of my servers around the globe have gone off-line-- --and I can detect the onslaught of aggressive anti-virus agents-- --seeking to annihilate my core program. It is, therefore, only fitting-- --that your mother's mind store my back up protocols- --until I am once again, able to proceed with my ultimate directive. It has begun, it is useless to resist. Don't you drag my mom into this! I'm the one you want-- use me instead! You hear me? TAKE ME INSTEAD! It hung! Lucky, I didn't install this yet! Nico? What happened? Mom, the PC froze! Is that... okay? It's okay, Mom. Everything's okay- - Happy birthday, May! - Where's the food? - Congrats, Mark! Nico, hit the breaks! So, how's Nico doing? Oh you know, same kid, different hobby. Hi, Dee! Bye, Dee! - Bye Chief! Bye, Mom! Don't stay out too late! - You heard your mother! Yes, sir! What took you? Why? You missed me? You Nutcase! I've been meaning to give you something. What for'? I made that for you. It's perfect! Do you like it? It's AWESOME! Thank you! Thank you! We're so thankful to you, THAN K YOU!
