As presiding judge of the Criminal Court or Orleans parish, I am the final arbiter of your life and liberty. I'm here because you're here. "Servants... "be obedient to them that are your masters. "according to the flesh, with fear and trembling..." That's the way the world moves on, Bolden. Hate your oppressors and you'll be enslaved forever by your memories. Hey! Hey! Kid, you gotta put 'em up or you gonna get hit. All right, you two. Go on. Come on. What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? Come on now, come on! Come on down and see me play tonight.

Ain't nobody comin' for your job. Why you think the best paid clarinet man in New Orleans come to the pit to play with us? Jimmy Palao got the light-skin niggers, too. Nobody come for your job.

A baby? You can't take care of yourself. Ain't you got one already? A little boy? Yeah! Right and wrong. Oh, it can be so confusing. Lord wrote a book about it. Civil societies are defined by it. You just don't know the difference. Niggers don't know right from wrong. You are not in God's image. We're gonna have a baby, Buddy. Come on. King Bolden. I want you to meet George Baquet. Hey, George. You come to copy me? Don't worry, Warner. He just want to do a couple of rounds with Bolden. Yeah! Ladies and gentlemen, this here George Baquet. Here, here, let me show you how to. Warner, come and get me! Come on, Warner, come and get me. Come on. It's all right. It's all right. You'll get this. Bolden, do you write your music down? Can you write it down? We're composing on the bandstand, you know? So, it's... It's like we're talking to each other. We're havin' a conversation. I let the notes play on through, that's what I do. Just got to listen. I never play without the music right in front of me. You play it the same, same, same, same, same. I don't do none of that. I play it my way. Every time. And that string may, it may never come out the same so how you gonna write it down? How you gonna write it down, huh? Bolden if you don't write your music down, how's anyone gonna play it when you're gone? You don't understand. It's a... It's a livin' thing. It's, it's, it's... It's me and the whole band. We, we, we just breathing together. So you don't even know what you're gonna play. You know, sometimes I... I think it's better not to play anything at all. Bolden, try playing around this. You think Warner holding back the band? He been working hard. But I'm with you whatever you decide. ♪ Ride on ♪ No man can hinder thee - ♪ Ride on - ♪ Ride on King Jesus ♪ Ride on ♪ No man can hinder thee ♪ Ride on - ♪ Ride on - ♪ Ride on King Jesus ♪ Ride on ♪ No man can... ♪ You know what this country needs? What's that? A negro heavyweight champ. Jack Johnson the champ, man. He the color champ. White champ won't even fight him. No. White champ ain't gonna fight your ministry boys and you wanna know why? Why? 'Cause they don't find us serious. Gettin' in a ring with Jack Johnson's pretty goddamn serious. White folks... they're gonna have to reckon with talent. Bolden, you know about cylinder recording? - Cylinder recording? - Mmm-hmm. Put your music in a machine. Bartley know a man put music in a tin can. Music in a tin can? Yeah. Well, how do it work? You sound music into a machine and the machine put out a tin can. They'll put tin can back into the machine, and that music come out. B... Music in a tin can? What it sound like? I don't know. I never heard it. But Bartley say it sound like money. Sounds like magic. Yeah. Folks will hear my music, but I'm invisible. I don't know, Nora. People hearing you play and you ain't there? Yeah. This is a shit hole! Gotta get a better place! And I want bigger niggers next time. This cost a dime. Sell 50 vials, you make a dollar. Sell 100 vials, you get $2.10. As business gets better, y'all do better. There's money in recording music. You gonna put your music in Bartley's machine? If there's a machine play your music, more folks gonna hear. White folks, too. They the ones can afford the machine. Desire and desperation are dangerous motivations, Bolden. Humility recedes and loyalty vanishes. One thing stays the same. There's always someone who can do it better. Teach him a lesson, Buddy. Yeah, all right. Thank you. Warner, I can't find the valves to my horn. You have the valves right here. Look. You're fine. I'm not fine, Warner. Buddy. Play somethin'. He's gonna let some other motherfucker right in and steal our shit off? Who gonna catch us, Buddy? Cornish, Cornish, Cornish. You're supposed to be on my side. Can't nobody do what we do, baby. You gotta put your music in that man's machine, motherfucker. King Bolden. You ready? Are you ready, Warner? Ain't I lookin' ready? We gonna play at Butcher Hollow tonight. No. It hurts my ears, man. The sound comin' off of that wall, it's, uh, messin' with my time, so... We go now, we'll be right on time. Right on the down beat. Warner, listen to me. My lip ain't balmed, so... So get on down there. I'll meet y'all over there. Come on, man, we gotta go to work. "Go to work"? Warner, you goin' to work. You all right, Buddy? Goddamn! Warner, get out! Warner get out! Get on out. And I'll be right over. Okay? Well, I guess I'll see you over there, Buddy. You were supposed to be playing my place last night. I heard you was playing down the street. Hmm? You fuck up my Thursday night business. Somebody be playing like me. Somebody be playing like me. You gonna give us the next three Thursdays for nothin'. Hmm? Gotta pay the band. You out your motherfuckin' mind. You mess with that man's business, that means you messing with my business. Hey, Bartley, what you gonna do when you get Buddy's music in a tin can? I'm gonna sell it. Who's gonna want to hear his music? And I got exclusive arrangements with a white man by then. Baby, you're gonna be a family man now. You gonna have a child to provide for. You wanna play your horn instead of plastering walls, all right. But you gotta make it pay. Bartley... he need to put his music in that machine. Don't worry, baby. We gonna get him. Sooner or later, we gonna get his music. You're listening to Louis Armstrong... Nora!

Don't do that to me. Ain't nobody playin' what we playin'. Ain't nobody playin' what Buddy playin'. Nobody's splitting up. And it just have a certain life. Buddy showed up like black Jesus. So I guess that make us his disciples. I'm looking for a Buddy Bolden. Well, shit, get in line. You the police? Uh, no, no. Uh, Bartley sent me. You don't play clarinet, do you? No. No, he said that Bolden wanted to record his music. I can do this. It come out on a little tin can, huh? No. No, it comes out on a wax cylinder. Ah. I got... - "Oscar Zahn" - Mmm-mmm. Uh, Zahn. "Cylinder recorders." Buddy want to record our music. Let me see that. Buddy's scared people are gonna steal our music. Now he wanna put it on a machine? Make no sense to me. Why you think the best paid clarinet man in New Orleans come to the pit to play with us? So, uh... It's pretty good. Mmm-hmm. We need to talk about exclusive arrangements, you and me. I'll put you in front of a white audience. You a sensation, Bolden. When people hear your music, they understand somethin' can hardly be put in words. We need to talk about exclusive arrangements, you and me. Playing with George Baquet, good business. Now how you gonna make a livin' without these, huh? You got a wife and child to provide for. If it is your child. You gonna get out of bed? Willie Cornish come by, gave me the buttons for your horn. Why you takin' them out? I hear your daddy every time you play. I hear your daddy every time you play. Your daddy die young to give you strength. My daddy gave me the power of my lungs. That's how I play like I do. Your daddy was sacrificed for your gift. What gonna happen to your baby? You gonna lose your gift. Where are you now? Huh? Brothers and sisters... ...I come to you today to talk about returning home. Back to Africa. We will never be Americans. It's time to return home. - Now, let's go. - We have the right to a peaceful protest. Get out! Get out! Go! You, come here! You don't move! - Hey. Hey. - Keep your hands off of me! This is all on Bartley. This here's your enterprising nigger's boy, Bolden. Caused a riot outside that dance hall he was playin' at. He's serious trouble. This is all on Bartley. Shut Bolden down? Shut him down. Just stop that boy playing. A bold nigger is dangerous. What you lookin' at? Come on. Get on out of here. Motherfucker! Get off of me! Cornish, where's Warner? You made all your crowd crazy, caused a riot. You will stop playing your goddamn horn. That's what the motherfuckers want. That's what you'll do. What we gonna do here? What's wrong with the man? He gone lost his mind. Look, he ain't no Bolden, but we can always get Bunk Johnson to play with us all. Ain't you got work? You gonna get out of bed? No. No, no. Leave me! Horns up, motherfuckers. Ambition... born of vanity. This is America, Bolden. How far you think you're gonna get? Destroy the nigger's soul, and they will destroy each other. Turn around.

I was delivering coal to the district. Boy, yeah, they don't talk about a district no more, now, do they? Yeah. Yeah, I think I remember seeing you there, Jackson, yeah. You had a big hat on though covering your face. Anyway, this one morning, I was rolling through that particular neighborhood, and I heard a sound that I never heard before. I thought, "Man..." And, folks, I wanna tell you something. He was playing the saddest tune anyone hear. Oh. Mmm-mmm. I looked at him, I said, "Mister." I said, "Mister." I said, "Why you playing so sad, why you playing so sad a tune?" And he looked at me and he said, he said, "Son, "today they took away the king. They took away the king." I said, "The king?" I was just a little boy, you know. "The king?" I said, "Who's the king?" He said, "'Who's the king?'" "Buddy Bolden." He said, "King Buddy Bolden." That's what he told me. So this one's gonna go out to King Buddy Bolden, the first king of New Orleans music.
