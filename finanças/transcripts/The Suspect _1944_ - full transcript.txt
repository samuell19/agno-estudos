Good afternoon, Mrs Simmons. Good afternoon, Mr Marshall. Isn't it a fine spring day? - Oh, it's lovely. You've done wonders with your garden. I've a green thumb as they say in Devon. Would you like some plants? Thank you very much but I'm afraid my wife .. Hasn't got much time to look after the garden and I .. Whoa. What do you want? Order was to be here at 6 o'clock sharp, Guvnor. Twenty-six? - Twenty-six is right, sir. Oh. Well, Mr Philip Marshall. What a privilege it is to see you at home at last. What is the cab for, Cora? - What do you think? A penny bus is enough for me whenever I get a minute from slaving in this house. Did John send for that cab? Bright as a button, aren't you. That's just what young hopeful did. He's clearing out bag and baggage the selfish ungrateful good-for-nothing. What did you do to him? - What did I do to him? That's right. Put the blame on me. All I did was to bring him into the world .. And nurse him and make myself into a doormat for him to walk on. Go on, go to him. Tell him when he leaves this house he needn't think he can come crawling back. Deserting his own mother. Well, son. - I'm sorry, dad. Leaving? Well, it was bound to come. I'd stick it out here on your account. - What happened? She was at me all day to mend the kitchen sink. I just couldn't take the time. It's been a race at the office you know. There is not a chap there who wouldn't give his right arm for the Canadian job. I know. And I have been doing some extra work in my own time. Cost estimates. I thought it might give me a leg up. She got into one of her rages. Before I could stop her. Twenty pages .. A whole week's work. Have you a place to stay? I'll stay at Jimmy Easterbrook's. I'm sorry, boy. It can't be helped. Allow me. - No thank you. Let me have your address at Jimmy's. I'll keep in touch with you, dad. This bank holiday maybe, if you're not too busy. Well, that's definite. - Right. We can spend a day at Margate perhaps and go on the river. I'd like that, dad. A pity this house isn't good enough for you. Goodbye, mother. "Goodbye, mother"? You mealy mouthed hypocrite. Two of a kind, that's what you are. Right here, sir. Well. I'll see you soon, dad. - I shall miss you, son. Philip. Come here. Don't you go sneaking off upstairs. Running off while I'm talking to you. Just as though I were a common servant. I know what's right even if you don't. And what do you think you're doing now? Moving into John's room. Wholly indecent! We are married, aren't we? - We are married alright. Then how dare you! I forbid it. Do you hear me? I forbid you to treat me like this. No, Cora. That's all over now that John has gone. Al over and done with. Do you understand me? I am moving out of here and there is nothing you can do about it. Oh yes there is. There is plenty I can do. What's got into you? I would like to know what is going on in your head. It is much better that you shouldn't, Cora. It might frighten you. A very interesting piece, sir. Yes, indeed. Can I be of any service, madam? It isn't closing time, is it? Very nearly, madam. I should like to .. - We don't cigarettes to ladies, madam. Oh no, of course not. I should like to see the manager please. Mr Marshall. If you will kindly step this way, Miss. And take a seat. He will be with you in a moment. Merridew. Yes, Mr Marshall? I have to bring a very serious matter to your attention. Yes, sir? I regret to say there is a shortage in your accounts. There is a penny missing in the stamp box. It was for a sugar bun this morning. But I will put it back on pay day. Honest, Mr Marshall. And the tuppence the day before yesterday? What was that for? Acid drops, sir. Acid drops? That's very serious. And the halfpenny the day before? For the monkey with the hurdy-gurdy. I will put it all back on Saturday. Every last farthing. That's what all embezzlers plan to do. I'm not an embezzler. Yes, but you have started that way. It's the first step that counts. After that, it all becomes too easy. Sixpence tomorrow. Half a crown the day after. And then a five-pound note. - But .. I know you always mean to pay it back. But I am afraid you will finish by paying it back in the Portland quarries. Don't send me to no quarries. Please, Mr Marshall. No this time, Merridew. Stop sniffling and wipe your eyes. There is a young lady to see you, Marshall. Would you step this way please. Won't you sit down. - Thank you. What can I do for you? It is what I'd like to do for you. I am seeking employment. Here? Yes. Office work. I know how to take dictation. We are very satisfied with our young men. Our young men have been in our employ for thirty or forty years. Well, I wouldn't think of taking anyone else's place. I only thought that .. Well, you see I know how to use the new typewriting machine. We have never felt the need for such contraptions at Frazer and Nicholson. I see. Well. - I am so sorry. I think you might have better luck in a draper's establishment. I have tried. Lovely spring weather we're having isn't it? Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight, Mr Marshall. Goodnight, Jarvis. Not gone yet, Marshall? No. Is there anything further I can do for you tonight Mr Fraser, sir? No thank you. Always the last. Always the last. Goodnight, Mr Marshall. - Goodnight. Merridew. Yes, Mr Marshall, sir? Mind you put that threepence halfpenny back in the stamp box by Saturday. Hmm? - Yes. And don't you ever let this happen again. It won't, Mr Marshall. - No. Run along now. Merridew. Yes, sir? Goodnight, tuppence. - Goodnight, Mr Marshall sir. I beg your pardon. Is there anything I can do? - Go away, please. Leave me alone. Mr Marshall. I thought you were trying .. I wasn't. I'm hardly the type. Please forgive me. I only wanted to help if I could. Thank you. You are very kind. I'm afraid I am behaving rather badly. Now come, come. It can't be that bad. Would .. Talking about it make it a bit easier? At any rate, won't you let me take you to your bus? I'd be glad if you would. I was very sorry about the work in my office Miss ..? Gray. Mary Gray. Miss Gray. Disappointment is a bit of a facer always. It wasn't just that. I've been going about all day and I forgot to have lunch. I was feeling a bit down. All at once it came over me how terribly alone I was. You see. My father died in the winter and there was just the two of us. I know what it is to be lonely and I know that that can be faced. Does that make you feel any better? - Ever so much. Where are you going? Home. Oh, I see. A cup of tea, a sixpenny novel and a good long cry? I'm afraid you've been looking in at my window. That's right. Smile. I'll try. Shall we pool our loneliness. What do you mean? Go somewhere for a bite to eat and have a talk. And I'm sure I know someone .. Who needs the services of a young lady who can use those typewriting machines. Well .. Why not try just for this evening? You might enjoy it and it would be a great kindness to me. I'm sure it would be to me. But aren't you on your way to someone? Someone? No. There is no-one. Cabbie. 22 Old Compton Street. That Chinese place. It was very good of you to take me on trust. Not altogether. I saw you with that little boy. Oh, you mean Merridew? The one you are not going to send to the Portland quarries. I am taking a terrible risk. He is a desperate character, don't you think? So desperate I wanted to hug him. That is the danger of his type. They get round you. You were so gentle with him. - Gentle? Me, gentle? My dear Miss Gray, you will discover in time .. I have a heart of stone. Philip, I've had such a good time since we met. I can't thank you enough. - And please don't try. You say the nicest things, you do the nicest things. What have I done now? Have you forgotten that you got me my job at Exton & Winwood. Don't remember a thing about it. I only remember the things that haven't happened yet. Speaking of that, how about dinner tomorrow night? I hate to eat alone. - That's sweet of you. Oh dear. I can't. Why not? Otherwise engaged. Mrs Packer, I told you about her. She works at Exton & Winwood. A real old dear. She's been frightfully nice, so I asked her and her husband to dine with me. Oh, I see. Listen, why don't you come along? I'd like very much for you to meet them. Why, I'd like to very much, but .. No "buts". Come along, Philip. Listen, Mary. You and I are pretty good friends. The best. We've had a lot of fun together. Just the two of us. Can't we go on like this? What is it Philip that you don't ever like to meet anyone? Well. A chap my age has a right to a few peculiarities. I know there is something. If you'd only tell me. Nothing to tell. As you wish. Of course, you are free to do as you like. Goodnight, Philip. Mary. I'm sorry about tomorrow night. What about the next night? Can you come? You know I'll say yes. - I like you. Goodnight. Goodnight. I won't be dragooned, I tell you. It is not me that's dragooning you, Mr Simmons. Closing time is closing time. Good evening, Mr Crummit. I'll take Mr Simmons home. Oh, it's Marshall. Hello. Goodnight, Mr Crummit. Come along. Mr Marshall. - Huh? Your wife has been enquiring about you. Oh. Has she? Yes, and rather sharply on the whole. Sharp as a knife. I know. A married man myself. It's alright Crummit. Marshall will pay. - I'm sorry. Goodnight, gentlemen. Look here, you ruddy beggar. Come along, Simmons. You can tell me all about it on the way home. A shopkeeper counting every drop. A horse leech. Shopkeepers are all horse leeches. Sucking the blood of their betters. You know Marshall, my grandfather would never put up with it. If Master Crummit had the impertinence to send him a bill. He'd have had him horsewhipped. - Aha. The brave days of old. You're a decent chap you know Marshall, for a shopkeeper. That's very good of you. I don't hold it against you. - Thank you very much. Would you lend me ten bob for a week? So it is you, Gilbert? Who did you think it would be? - Good evening, Mrs Simmons. Evening. Edith, say good evening to Mr Marshall. - Gilbert, please. Go in and lie down for a bit. It will do you good. Sharp as a knife. I know. You were very kind to bring him home. - Glad to be of service. Tell me, what's the latest news of John? He is doing very well. His firm are thinking of sending him to Canada in the spring. Oh you will miss him. I won't see him at all then. - Why, that is too bad. Edith, Edith. Blast the woman. - Yes Gilbert, I'm coming. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mrs Simmons. Oh, it's you. Come in. Flattered, I'm sure. My key, please? I'll give it to you when I've said my say and not a minute before. My key. A pretty state of affairs isn't it when a married woman .. Has to do a thing like that to get her husband .. To enter the room where he belongs to say a civil word to her. We've nothing to say to each other. Oh haven't we? Well I have something to say if you haven't. How much longer do you think I can stand you coming in all hours of the night? The neighbours are starting to gossip. - None of their business, Cora. Married people's lives is everybody's business. And I'll not be made an object of pity in front of my friends. Do you hear me? Only last night, the Jevnes came in. "Where's Philip" they said. "Off on holiday"? Oh no, I said. Philip is working. "What, on the Sabbath?" I could have flopped to the floor, I was so mortified. But how was I to know it was Sunday or any day .. With you never at home and all the days alike. That was awkward for you, Cora and I am sorry it happened. A lot you care. What have I ever done to deserve this? I wonder whatever possessed me to tie myself up to a poor stink like you. Walked through the forest and picked a crooked tree. That's what I did. A crooked, fat ugly tree. And I don't care if I never see your ugly face again. Come on, out. Get out! Take your key and go and lock yourself in. Live there, die there. Rot there for all I care. Stop crying, Cora. Don't you know they can hear every word we say next door. I don't care. I've nothing to be ashamed of. Crying won't help. We've been through all this so many times before and it is got us nowhere. But if we could only talk quietly. What are you driving at? - Cora. If we could come to some sort of understanding, it might help us. Now listen. If we face things honestly we'd admit we have never been happy together. Have we? Not once, all the years we've been married. Whose fault is that I'd like to know? - It isn't anybody's fault. We've tried to rub along together. Over and over again we've tried it. And it isn't that I do this or that you do that. Do you know when two people are shut up together and don't love each other .. Everything they do becomes hateful just because they do it. Oh so that's it, is it? You hate me. You've always hated me. Cora, I did not say that. Will you please listen to me. All I say is that we have some good years ahead of us. Both of us. Why can't we live them happily? Apart from each other. Apart? What do you mean? Let me go, Cora. What are you talking about? - Just that. Let me go. Divorce? Do you mean divorce? Never in my life have I heard of anything so immoral. And downright indecent. Divorce, indeed. Oh no. I'm not going to be laughed at. A woman who couldn't hold her husband. Just for that you should do for both of us. We're married, aren't we? We'll stay so until death do us part. Do you hear me? I hear you but it won't help. I have my mind made up. If you don't divorce me I'm going to leave you. Oh, you are? - Yes. Well, you just try it. Just you try to leave me. I'll go to your precious shop and tell your noble customers what sort you are. I knew how this would end. I knew it was no use talking you. There is no way out, is there. Oh, yes there is for you, Mr Philip Marshall. Out of your shop! Out of your job! Won't I like to see Frazer's face when I tell him that his very proper manager .. His elegant Mr Marshall. The pillar of respectability who wants to divorce his own wife. And I will tell him, so help me! Run along, or you'll be late. I told you she'd like the velvet more. - Who is she? Mrs Rockwood Nelson. That big dray horse? Get along, Marge. She's in a lather out there. Thanks, Packer. I think I'll keep it on a bit. Oh no you don't. I know what's on your mind, dearie. You want to wear it for that precious dance of yours tonight. Come on, off with it. Sure you won't change your mind and come, Mary? Thanks. I'd love to but I've got an engagement. I bet I know what it is. Her young man doesn't dance. Doesn't he? He dances divinely. He just doesn't like the usual places. No? Not really, Mary. You know, this is the first time she's ever told us a word about him. What's he like? Oh, he is tall and slender. Poetic. The most soulful eyes. Not the least touch of swank about him. You would never dream he came from one of our very best families. What? You don't mean the nobility, dearie? - Oh, for hundreds of years. Of course his family won't have a thing to do with me. He doesn't care a button. He has a vast income of his own. Coffee in Brazil. Diamonds in South Africa. Oh, it is most unbelievable. Quite. Because it isn't true. Not a word of it. Mary Gray. Teasing us like that. You and your dream boy. You should see him. He weighs 14 stone if he weights an ounce. He doesn't dance, not a step and he's not the least bit romantic. I don't care because I'm not either. Go along with you, you fibber. And he works in a shop, same as I do. And he has a son. - A son? Yes. And he is kind and thoughtful and always looking after one. He makes you want to look after him. Just like my old man. Sounds very cosy to me, if you don't happen to care for him. But I do. The question is, does he care for me? Doesn't he? Has he asked you yet, dearie? Not yet but I am hoping. Tonight maybe. He spoke as if tonight was something special. Arrivederci. Come back soon. You aren't eating a thing. Aren't you well? Oh yes. Did anything happen on your way here? You were so late. No. But you are so unlike yourself tonight, Philip. What is it? Mary, I am troubled. Can't I help? There isn't any help anywhere. Surely it can't be so bad. It's the worst possible for both of us. Mary, after tonight we can't see each other anymore. What did you say? I said we mustn't see each other ever again. Don't look like that. Philip, we've had a very pleasant friendship. It's meant a lot to me. I hope it's meant something to you. It's meant everything. Then don't you think I deserve to know? Tell me, Philip. Well it is very difficult. You see, I have behaved very badly. Do you remember the first time we met? I remember. I told you I had attachments and no ties of any kind. You mean, you're married? It wasn't very fair, was it. No. You see. I was afraid you would never see me again. And I couldn't let you go once I'd met you. Could I? I could face anything but losing you and I was sure she would let me go. I've begged her for a divorce. Won't she? - No. This is our last time together. You've risked too much already. Please Philip. Please. No. She must never .. I am much too fond of you. Shall I pour it now, sir? Mary. By all means. This is an occasion. - Thank you, Miss. My dear. My very dear. Is that you, Cora? Who else? Come in. I've something to show you. - Well .. Merry Christmas. - Hmm. Do you like it? - It's a fair treat. With candles tuppence a dozen. Couldn't you find a better way to waste money? Christmas comes but once a year. - Did you think that up all by yourself? What a mind you have. I think I'll put this in here. Yes it will look lovely. And where will you hang the mistletoe? - I didn't get any. What? No mistletoe? Aren't you going to kiss me under the mistletoe? You could shut your eyes you know and pretend I was somebody else. There is no-one else, Cora. No. Just our two selves. Derby and Joan. Going down the hill of life together. That's quite true, Cora. Wouldn't it be best if we tried to make things pleasanter for one another .. And try to make this a bit more like home. You're doing your best, aren't you love. No more evenings at the pub, no more office work keeping away in the city. A real little family man. You will help a bit, won't you? There is no place like home. Is there now? Since that creature threw you out. What are you saying? That hussy you were gallivanting after, that's what. Don't tell me there was no such person. There is no such person, Cora. That's right, turn tail and run. I don't wonder you can't look me in the face with a lie like that on your lips. "No such person" indeed. You are wrong, Cora. - Am I? Then what are you staring like that for? You are maybe asking yourself how much I know. Exton & Winwood. That's where she works. Malvern Crescent. That's where she lives. Mary Gray. That's her filthy name. Well? Why don't you say something? It's true Cora but it is all over and done with. Is it? Not for me it isn't. Do you know what I am going to do? I'll go to old Frazer. - Cora, no. I'll show you up for the worthless rotten old customer you are. But if you think I'm through when I've got you turned out, you're mistaken. I'll do the same for her. You mustn't. I'll go to the house where she lives. I'll go to the place where she works. And I'll let them know what a low creature she is. You don't know what you are saying. - Don't I? No decent shop will take either of you. And no respectable house will take in a loose woman. Cora, you are driving me .. I'll drive you both into the gutter where you belong. Cora, please! Afraid? Aren't you. Afraid for her. Ha. No. Not for her. Well, you had better be. Because as sure as the sun rises tomorrow. I'll give her a merry Christmas she'll never forget. Go on. Tack up your silly greens. That's all you're fit for. Accidents will happen in the best regulated families, ma'am. But it was such a dreadful accident. Tuppence worth of sprouts please. They were such an ideal couple and never a cross word between them. That's right. Mr Marshall is the one I feel sorry for. Losing his wife so sudden. Those narrow stairs are death-traps I've always said. Tuppence worth of onions. Instantaneous death was the Coroner's verdict. By accident and misadventure. And I will take these three oranges. You ladies are going to the funeral, I suppose? Of course we are. She was one of our best friends. When will it be? Tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock. This way please. Doesn't she look natural. Like she was asleep. Thank you so much, Miss Crevy. I'm so sorry, Mr Marshall. First carriage, Miss Crevy. Thanks very much. Biscuits and sherry later. I saw the bottles. And sandwiches too I think. She will be waiting for you, Philip. And watching over you. Second carriage, Mr and Mrs Chadwick. It was so good of you to come. Good day. Mr and Mrs Rogers. Fourth carriage please. Philip. Time, you know, heals even the deepest wounds. Have faith. Cora had faith. Mr Marshall. Come here a minute. I have something for you. I think you had better drink this. What is it? Thank you. Tell me, have you slept much since? No. Not very well. - I thought so. I do wish you'd take some Bayer's Evadine. I don't want to get the habit. - Nonsense, I use it regularly. Bayer's Evadine. Just five drops in a glass of water. But be sure and read the instructions otherwise it might be dangerous. Sounds terrible but I might try it. Good. Sleep is what you need and a little quiet. I am going to send these merrymakers home. Thank you. Goodnight. - Goodnight. See you soon I hope. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. You've been very helpful. - Getting rid of them? No, for everything. I cannot tell you how indebted I am to you. Don't think of it. You've been so kind to Gilbert and me. Sleep well. Goodnight. - Thank you. Well, Dad? - What? You don't look too fit. I wish I could do something for you. You've taken it wonderfully so far. I'm proud of you. - Run along, boy. Are you sure you don't want me to stay? No. You are right. I just want you to know that .. That you have nothing to reproach yourself for. No-one ever tried harder. It might rain. You'd better take an umbrella. Right. I say Dad, where is your stick? You know, the one old Frazer gave you. I don't know. I left it somewhere. It doesn't matter. Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight, John. [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] Who is it? My name is Huxley. Who? Inspector Huxley. Scotland Yard. Come on in, Inspector. Mr Marshall? - Yes. I've been told to stop in and look around. It's a nuisance really but I'm afraid I must ask you a few more questions. What about? About the death of your wife. I have answered all those questions. You must have seen the report. Yes. As a matter of fact I read the file quite thoroughly. The Coroner called it an accident. - Allow me. That's why I say it hardly seems worth bothering you and missing my own dinner. But we must do as we're told of course. - Of course. I need hardly tell you that you don't have to answer any questions. I shall be glad to. I take it this is the place where the accident occurred? Yes. Do you mind if I look around a bit? Not at all, but it's all been done. Yes, I know. This is what tripped her, I suppose when she was coming downstairs that night. Yes. That's right. You should have a thing like that repaired you know. Well, I keep on meaning to, but .. These days I keep forgetting. Is that the room she came out of there? No, that's my room. Hers is on the other side. Oh yes, of course. Now I remember. Things are much clearer now. There is nothing like being on the actual spot, you know. Much better than trying to visualise things from a written report. I imagine it must be. Oh. - Hmm? Is that where she struck her head? Yes, it was broken so I .. Had it replaced at once. - Yes, I couldn't bear the sight. Why do you make a point of that? No particular reason. Except in a case of death by accident we have to consider every possibility. That's why it seems so curious that we still find that broken step unrepaired. And this banister replaced so promptly. What are you trying to suggest? Nothing. If it wasn't an accident, you must be thinking .. Precisely. Let us suppose, purely from my point of view that .. On Christmas Eve the murderer was sitting in this chair. He was alone. His wife was upstairs. He was alone and thinking. He had to do away with her. He had to do it for a reason that only he knew. But it had to be done. So. He got up and walked over to where the canes were. He took one of them and weighed it carefully. Was it heavy enough? If not, he'd have to add more strength. He mustn't make a sound. The stairs should creak and warn her. She mustn't hear him going up. He reaches the broken step. And made sure that it looked broken. He had to hide somewhere in the darkness. There is a corner. By the chest where he could hide. There he waited. He puts his hand over his mouth so his voice sounds as if came from a distance. And he stood there in the darkness watching the door to the bedroom. And a voice that wasn't quite his own called "Cora!" He had waited a lifetime. And then he called again. Cora! He hardly knew his own voice. He heard her feet shuffling. And then the door opened. For a moment she was silhouetted against the door at the top of the stairs. Grumbling and wondering why the hall light wasn't burning. Maybe she cried sharply. "What's the matter?" He didn't answer now she stood so near. He waited, the blood drumming in his ears. Her voice came over once more. "Philip, are you alright?" He held his breath. His hand tightened on the stick. She passed him. She went down one step. Two. Three. It's now or never. Now! And there she was. She wasn't dead yet. He could hear the breath coming from her broken body. But she had to die. So he had to hit her again. And he only hoped he could hit her in the same spot. Slowly he raised the stick and .. No! You haven't a shred of evidence. How dare you say I killed my wife. How dare you. Who said you did? I merely said if your wife was murdered. It could have happened that way, Mr Marshall. It could have happened that way but it didn't. But it is an interesting point of view, don't you think. Now if only we could find something. Some little something as a motive. You understand what I mean, Mr Marshall? I don't. No? Goodnight. Oh. Pardon me, ma'am. Did you want to come in? No. No, thank you. Philip. It's been a long time. Yes. It's been a long time. We had better not talk here. Can't you see how frightfully unfair it was to let .. The outrageous suspicions of those stupid people to keep us apart. Please understand Mary, I just didn't want you mixed up in this sort of thing. Why not? What are people for anyway? People you love. Can't you see that if you were in trouble I had a right to share it? Yes, but not that kind of trouble, Mary. Just to be suspected leaves a mark. Alright. Then let it leave a mark on both of us Philip Marshall. Because I don't intend to let you go again. Mary. Don't you see that this sort of persecution will come to an end? And we'll look back and we'll wonder why we ever let it bother us. Believe me we will. Yes? With the compliments of the house, sir. And it is very good to see you again. If I may say so. It's very nice to be here, Martin. Thank you, sir. And shall I pour? By all means. This is an occasion. You see, Philip. They missed us. Mary. My dear. My very dear. Salud. Salud. That is Italian. Wait. I shan't be a moment. Do you wish to see me? Yes, Miss. I'd like a few words with you, please. Well, I'm in rather a hurry. So am I. What is it you wish to see me about? Not much. Just a few questions. I am Inspector Huxley of Scotland Yard. I'd like to ask you a few things about Mr Philip Marshall. Oh? What about Mr Philip Marshall? If you don't mind, Miss. I'll ask the questions. How long have you known him? Since last May. Did you meet his wife before or after you met him? I never met his wife. But you did know that he was married? Naturally. And knowing that he was married, you continued to meet him frequently? Oh. Yes. Look here. What are you driving at? Why are you asking me so many questions? Because it is quite possible that Mrs Marshall was murdered. Philip Marshall a murderer? Nonsense. I think you are making a fool of yourself, Inspector. What you think isn't evidence, Miss. What you have been telling me about your meetings with Mr Marshall is. But I haven't told you anything. Very valuable evidence. You have given us the motive that we have been looking for. You will be called as a witness for the Crown, Miss Gray. Not "Miss Gray" Inspector. Mrs Philip Marshall. We were married this morning. Oh, I see. That was a cunning move, wasn't it. Cunning? - Well, it might be called that. As it is a known fact that a wife cannot be made to testify against her husband. Do you know it is a very funny thing but we never thought of that. Didn't you really? And it's just coincidence that you've silenced the only witness .. Whose testimony could possibly hang you? Philip .. must we listen to this? No we mustn't, darling. Come along. Would you wait for me in the cab. I'll be there in a minute. You're getting rather tiresome Inspector with your ifs and maybes .. And I don't choose to listen to them any longer. Is that clear? Don't you think an innocent man might be more tolerant in the cause of justice? No I don't. I think an innocent man might behave precisely as I have. I am sorry but I can't agree with you. Why don't you arrest me? Here I am. I'd like to, believe me. But unfortunately I can't. So you have run against a blank wall. Take my advice and don't beat your head against it. Goodbye. Just a moment. I don't wish to antagonise you but you must realise my situation. I have a job to do. It is quite impersonal, I assure you. It is quite possible I have been wrong about the whole thing. If have been I am very sorry. Very well, let's forget it. Let me wish you a most successful marriage. And a long one. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hello, hello, hello. - Good morning, Mrs Packer. Here we are. One of our morning vices. Morning, Packer. - Morning, Guvnor. You're Sybil Vane from John's office. I'm John's father. I should never have recognised you. Look here my young friend, you'll do yourself an injury you will. Laughter puts a terrific strain on the heart. Does it? Mary is upstairs dressing. Last train for Margate. Come on, Sybil. - Mr Marshall. No nonsense now. You can help me make the sandwiches. That is a lovely room. I can see Mary's hand all over it. I'm glad you've got such a nice day for the seaside. Oh dear. Sandwiches? Did he say sandwiches? - I think he did. Why? Sandwiches is two thirds bread. Makes an awful knot in your stomach. It puts a terrific strain on your heart. Ow! What's that? I think that is John putting a slight strain on Sybil's heart. Mr Marshall, you mustn't. Why not? Just one little kiss. You'll never miss it. John, Stop that. If he ever tries to do that again, let me know. I'll take a stick to him. Would you excuse me? I'll just run upstairs and see what is keeping Mary. Don't hurry her, Mister M. Better hurry now than wait until the last minute. More people drop dead .. - I know, I know. Darling, it is me. You nearly ready? - Hmm. The Packers are here and they're waiting downstairs. And I have to go or I shall be late at the office. Wait a moment. I've got something to show you. What is it? Oh dear. It's the very latest thing, you know. It is startling at first. Do you think it is too revealing? Well .. If it isn't quite ladylike I shan't wear it. My darling. Anything you wear would become ladylike the moment you put it on. Oh Philip, you are an angel. I did so want to wear it. Come on or you're going to be late. What a shame you can't come with us. I will be down by the first train tomorrow morning. Alright. Bye-bye. - Bye. Good morning, Mrs Simmons. Hard at work? I enjoy pottering around. Mary tells me you may join us for the weekend. Yes, I was thinking about it. I've had such good times at Margate ad Brighton before. Why don't you come as our guest? Oh! I rather stumbled into the kitchen door. It was silly of me. I am .. so sorry. Good morning. - Good morning. Margaret. Margaret. - Yes, Mr Marshall? Get me another of these marvellous cherry tarts. Another cherry tart? I should say not. And you supposed to be on a strict diet. You heard what I said. I work very hard and I need to keep my strength up. Bring me another cherry tart. Very well. But you ought to be ashamed. You have no character at all. Hello, Marshall. May I sit down? I suppose so. - Thanks. Since you press me, I'll have a spot of whiskey. Give me a double whiskey and soda please, Miss. - Yes, sir. Margaret. Forget that cherry tart. Don't tell me I've spoiled your appetite. Since you press me, you have. That's too bad. You. You aren't irresistibly drawn to me, are you? No. I am not. Good. Give me a blunt, honest fellow every time. Well. Here is to love grown cold. What is it you want from me? If it's money, you won't get any. At least not until you change your ways. Sounds as if I was up before a judge. What is the charge? I saw your wife this morning. - Oh. So that's it. Wives get tiresome at times you know. I know this. You've got to stop knocking her about. It's easy for you to talk. You've got a nice, new wife. And a very pretty one too if I may say so. All beer and skittles now, isn't it? I'm very happy if that is what you mean. - It is and by the same token I am not. It's your own fault. You had every chance and you made a mess of things. I quite agree with you. But it so happens that I am a rotter by nature. A complete rotter. Why can't you get hold of yourself? You are still young with a charming wife. And no money. By the way. You couldn't see your way to let me have a fiver could you? Just until my wife's allowance comes due. Now I could not. Not a brass farthing. At least not until you pull yourself together and go to work. Work? My dear, Marshall. Work is for working men. Here. This will pay for your drink. Thanks, shopkeeper. Hello, Mr Simmons. Lovely day isn't it. - Filthy. And who are you? My name is Huxley. Oh, yes. You're the police chap who came asking questions after Mrs Marshall's death. That's right. May I buy you a drink? - I was just going to order one. Good man. At least you are paying for it. It will be a privilege, sir. Who is talking now? The same one as before. Your neighbour Mr Philip Marshall. I beg your pardon? What was that? Did it occur to you that Mrs Marshall's death might not have been an accident? Do you mind saying that again. You interest me. You don't know how much you interest me. Hello, Marshall. Found your back door open so I thought I'd come in and continue our chat. A chat with you is something I can do without. I am packing up to go to Margate in the morning so if you will excuse me. Oh, come. Surely you've got a few moments to spare for a reformed character? Huh? - Yes. I have taken your advice to heart. And decided to go to work. I would like your opinion. On an idea I got today. I think it is a good idea. With a bit of luck. Luck does play an important part in human affairs. Don't you think so? No I don't. I think a man makes his own opportunities. You ought to know. What do you mean? Oh, nothing. Only your wife died most conveniently. At the precise moment that it did you the most good. Wasn't that luck? Pure and simple? What are you driving at? - Me? I'm not driving at anything. I am merely pointing out how fortuitously things happen. Sometimes. Well? Well. Mrs Marshall has an accident. You come into a pot of money. And the Coroner's jury says "Bravo Marshall". I'd call that lucky. I call you an infernal busybody. Do you? Inspector Huxley doesn't. Huxley? What about Huxley? - You know those police fellows. A suspicious lot. They don't seem quite satisfied with the notion .. That Mrs Marshall's death was accidental. That's too bad. - Yes. Isn't it. Have you such a thing as a cigarette? - No. Too bad. I'll have to smoke one of my own. No. Huxley thinks you .. Shall we say, helped your wife to a better land. But he can't prove it. - Oh? No. He needs a witness. - Does he? And I need ten pounds. You are a swine, aren't you. Oh, quite. A filthy blackmailing swine. Shush. The walls are very thin, you know. That's how I happened to hear. You heard nothing. - I know. But suppose I were to say that I did? Christmas Eve when you and your wife were at it hammer and tongs. Suppose I were to say I heard her cry out? You didn't. - That I heard a blow. You're lying. That I heard her say: "Philip, don't." Nobody would ever believe you. That is quite possible. But it might put you in a very awkward position. Mightn't it? If I were to give evidence for the Crown? Yes, it might. You are quite right. It might put me in a very awkward position. Well. Here is five pounds. It is all I have in the house. Don't apologise. The banks will be open on Tuesday. You might draw twenty-five then. Another twenty-five next week? Or fifty maybe? The week after that and the week after that. I will let you down as lightly as I can. Besides, you've got plenty. Oh yes, I've got plenty. I say. Would you have such a thing as a spot of whiskey in the house? Whiskey? Yes, I have. I have got a bottle somewhere. I keep it for emergencies. It's always an emergency when I'm thirsty, old boy. You're a funny fellow, Simmons. I don't believe you know half how funny you are. I'll get the whiskey. I say. Don't let me make a pest of myself. I mean .. If you would rather I'd go .. - No, I want you to stay. Hello, puss. Come on, come on, pussy. You know, I wouldn't hurt a fly. You're a nice little cat. Come on, puss. Here you are. Help yourself. - What about you? Aren't you going to have one? You are a funny chap, Simmons. Funny? Didn't it every occur to you that blackmail might be dangerous? Not if you know your man. And I know you Marshall, like a book. Though you were easier than I thought. I say, don't you ever show fight? No. No, I've never been a fighter. You are soft, aren't you. Or perhaps you're one of those "turn the other cheek" fellows? Who looks for his reward in the hereafter. I like people and I've never wanted to hurt them. Oh, that's a very grave mistake. It's hurt or be hurt in this world. Suppose I ever bothered my head .. Wondering if I was treading on the other fellow's toes. No, I don't suppose you have. There you are. And here I am. Sweet and cosy for life. Or for as long as your life lasts. Are you hot? You see. Your lot .. were created. To make life. Easier. For my sort. The meek shall inherit the earth. We inherit the meek. Not bad. You're a coward, Marshall. That's how I got you. No more .. fight. Sheep. Couldn't .. kill .. a fly. But .. I'll help you down, Sybil. - But it is soaking wet. Help me with my umbrella will you, Mr Packer? Certainly. Always ready to oblige a lady. Run along everybody. I'll pay the cabbie. Stand by. Stand by everybody. I'll open the door. The door is bolted. Dad must be home. Your right, darling. He might be in bed. I say Dad, wake up! Hello in there, Dad! Wake up will you. We're back. Let us in. [ Door knocks ] This is a surprise. - Hello, Philip. Why did you take so long, Dad? - I was upstairs. So cold. A pity your weekend was spoiled. Does it always rain at Margate? Eight days a week and twice on Sundays. John, you are awful. Crikey, we were lucky to catch that last train. Dad is the lucky one. He had wit enough to stay home. Every time I go there I always ask myself why. Everybody, come in here. - I'll fix a bit of dinner. John. Are you coming, Philip? Come along. We've got to fix these people something to warm them up. Philip! What is it, Philip? Can't you help me find the whiskey? I'm sorry darling, but there isn't any. I'm sure there was some in the cupboard. - There was but it's all gone now. Oh, Philip. Is that what you do when my back is turned? How about the sherry? Will this keep out the cold? - It will have to do. It's a shame you had such bad weather. We did see a spot of blue sky once. Didn't you have a chance to wear your new bathing dress? I'll save that for the next time when you'll be with us. Sybil. Cone here. I want to show you something. A glass of sherry for Mr Packer. Thank you. Look! Somebody has lost their keys. Never mind. Put them in my pocket will you. My word, that will hit the spot. There is nothing like a good drop of sherry is there. Thanks. Look after your heart, darling. You look after your own heart, Mrs P. I'll look after mine. Mr M, here is to you. Who drinks in this house forgets his troubles. Oh, John. Look at this tiny baby. Isn't he ducky. "Ducky", am I? How do you suppose you would look in a big cold seashell with nothing on but .. Oh John, you mustn't say such things. Must he, Mr Marshall? I expect he will. You're every bit as nutty as he is. No thanks. I'll share Sybil's. You will, tiger? Ow! Something touched my ankle. - How ridiculous. It's a hallucination. - No it isn't. It touched me on the ankle. There is something under there. - Nonsense. I will show you. There is your spook. I told you I felt something. Supper is ready such as it is. Come along everybody. Bring your drinks. Are you coming, Philip? We'll have to eat and run, you know. - Yes, the last bus won't wait. I'd better put the cat out first. These gloves are all wet. Stick them in your pocket. Oh, we had a lovely time. - You must come again soon. Hurry up now or we'll miss that blinking bus. I'm seeing Sybil home. John, you are terrible. Toodle-ooh. Goodnight, - Goodnight. It was every so good of you to help me, Mrs Marshall. Mr Marshall. Come on, John. Goodnight, everybody. Goodnight. I wonder if John is really smitten with that girl. I dare say. She is a pretty little thing. I don't believe she ever had a thought in her head. It must hurt awfully to see her throw herself away like that. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't I what? You weren't listening. - Sorry. Philip, what is wrong? You look positively done in. Has anything happened? Of course not. Don't try to put me off. You've got something on your mind. Well, as a matter of fact .. I knew it. Come on now, no secrets between us. Alright, no secrets. Since you will have it. How would it be if we packed up .. And went off with John? You mean, to Canada? It might be fun, rather. But I thought you said you wanted to stay here. I know. But the more I think of the idea. The more I like it. You haven't been happy here, have you. Well. I'm sorry, I thought when we had the house done over that you would forget. But it is no use, is it. You mustn't blame yourself, Mary. I'd be happy anywhere with you. I feel that too. Do you want to know something? I will be glad and happy to leave this house. We'll be much better off any place else in the world. You feel that too? Let's go with John. It's a wonderful idea. I'm so happy I could dance. Look here, my girl. You are dancing off to bed. You've had a long, hard day. I'm not half as tired as you are. Besides, I want to clear things up. - I'll clear everything. But there is so much rubbish. - I'll clear up all the rubbish. Now run along. Alright. Pleasant dreams. I'll dream about Canada. Philip. Oh, Philip. Yes, dear? Don't forget to take the cat in. I won't forget. I've paid your bill. - We shall miss you, Mr Marshall. Canada is a great country. Blimey, I wish I was going with you. Well, good luck and the same to your family. Thank you, Mr Barker. Mr Marshall is a fine gentleman. Good Morning, Miss Pomfret. Good morning, Mr Marshall. - Would you allow me? Thank you. So you are off on the Bounding Main tomorrow? Yes, that is the plan. Well, with all the police nosing up and down the terrace I think you are lucky. How do you mean, lucky? It lowers the neighbourhood, Mr Marshall. Mr Simmons disappearing. Police rapping on doors and asking questions. Not that I don't think it is a good riddance. But do you mean to say that they've not been around bothering you about it? About Simmons? Why should they? After all, it's not the first time he's been away for days on end. No, but being his next door neighbour and all. Well, what would they want to know? Who saw him come. Who saw him go. Who saw him last is what they are driving at. Such a to-do about a worthless drunkard. He thought himself too good for us. But if you ask me, we are too good for him. Well, this is me. Thank you. Good morning, Miss Pomfret. - Goodbye. Oh, Mr Marshall. Won't you come in? Yes, sure. I just dropped in to say goodbye and to thank you for giving our cat a home. I was very glad to. You know, I've always loved animals but .. Gilbert just wouldn't let me keep any pets. Have you .. Heard any news of him? No. Not a word. I suppose this escapade of his is the talk of the gossips in the neighborhood. Well, you know. When you have the police hanging about .. It does set a lot of tongues wagging. I've been through this so many times. I suppose I should be used to it. I'm not. I wish there was something I could do. It's very kind of you. But I'm afraid there is nothing anybody can do. You know. Sometimes when Gilbert goes away like this, I .. I almost wish he wouldn't come back. I would go and stay with my sister and her children in Devon. But that is only a dream. He always does come back. I can't tell you how sorry I am, Mrs Simmons and I .. Think we know each other well enough. For me to be able to say that I .. Hope that someday soon you will be able to go back to Devon. Well, only a few more minutes to go. You know my heart is thumping. I can't believe it. I say, you are not going to regret this, are you? We are going to be very happy, you and John and I. I feel that too. He is such a baby. He needs all the help we can give him. Listen. Isn't that for you? Mister Philip Marshall. Mister Marshall. I will be back in a minute. Mister Philip Marshall. Hello. I am Philip Marshall. - There is a gentleman to see you, sir. Ah. Merridew. Thank you very much, Steward. Mr Marshall, I didn't want you to sail sir, without saying goodbye. I missed you that last year at the office. Now, how is your throat? Only a little raspy, sir. Mary. This is my fellow worker, Merridew. I am very glad to know you. I have brought you a present, Mr Marshall. That is nice of you. Can I open it? - Yes, sir. It's a sovereign remedy for Mal-de-Mer. Sea-sickness, Mr Marshall. I bought it with my own money. That was very thoughtful of you, Merridew. Wasn't it Mary? Indeed it was. We'll take good care of it. And I wish you the best of luck and health, Mr Marshall. And you, ma'am. And I am very much beholden to you. And mother says .. She hopes I grow to be as good a man as you are. I don't know about being good, Merridew. But if you are half as happy as I am .. There you are. I say, I've been looking all over the ship for you. What is it? Don't tell me the bags have gone astray? Not at all. They are in your stateroom. Dozens of them. I never saw so many bags. And my pullover is in one of them but I don't know which. In the brown bag, laddie. There are three brown bags, mama. I'll show you, sonny. If you will excuse us, Mr Merridew. Didn't I tell you he was helpless? [ Ship's horn ] I had better be going, sir. At once. I shouldn't want to be carried off to Canada. Just a minute. Look after that throat of yours. But how will I get it back to you, sir? You are to keep it. - Very good, sir. Yes. And stay at home for the rest of the week and tell you mother I said so. Yes, sir. Be a good boy, always. Yes, sir. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. Hello there, Marshall. Hello Inspector. You turn up everywhere, don't you. Yes, it does seem so, doesn't it. Are you sailing or seeing somebody off? Sailing. - Good. A marvellous country, Canada. I came down to see an old friend off. Name of Pennyfeather. Look him up after you sail, will you? Unless he looks me up. What do you mean? You think that .. Of course I do. - Nonsense. Forget it. That's water over the dam. Well. Goodbye. And good luck. Thank you, Inspector. By the way, Marshall. Have you seen the afternoon paper? - No. That neighbour of yours. That chap Simmons. You know? What about Simmons? He has turned up at last. You don't say so. - Yes, really. I rather thought you would be interested. Let's see now, where is it. It wouldn't be there I suppose. It is not important enough. Ah, here we are. Here it is. Buried at the bottom of the page, you see. Dear me. You sure it is Simmons? - Quite. They fished him out of the canal behind the terrace. He was knocked about a bit but it's him alright. How ghastly. He must have fallen in when he was tight. No. He was thrown in when he was dead. You mean to say he has been murdered? In cold blood. I can hardly believe that. Was he shot? No, he was poisoned in a pint of malt whiskey. How shocking. - Hmm. You know who did it? What? - Know who did it? Oh yes, yes. - Who? His wife. No. Oh yes. A perfectly clear case. She had a motive you know. He was a first-class rotter. You knew that. He used to knock her about. She admits it. And besides, there was a package of insurance money coming to her. Oh, that's not possible. - Oh, yes. Besides, she had the opportunity, you know. He was seen going into the house but nobody saw him come out. And the stuff he had in his stomach .. Was identical with some sleeping drug that she had on hand. But that is absurd. That woman couldn't have dragged the body to the canal. Why not? It is only a few feet to the end of the garden. She wouldn't have had the strength. - Oh, my dear chap. When it comes to finding strength or swinging .. It won't come to that. No jury would convict that woman. They'll convict her without even getting out of the box. Do you realize she hasn't any alibi? Why, she was in the house the whole time. I say, I didn't mean to upset you. I didn't dream that .. - Oh, she is innocent. Really? Do you have any proof? No. But one can't live next door to a person for eight years .. Without knowing something about them. Oh, my dear Marshall, when it comes to knowing what's in other people's hearts. Oh, there is my man now. Well, goodbye old chap. Now don't let it worry you. It's no affair of yours you know. Bon voyage. What shall it be, sir? Whiskey, sir? Three minutes to sailing. All ashore that's going ashore. All ashore that's going ashore. It is beyond me. The chap kills a man in cold blood and we let him sail away. Just like that. Well, what could I do? If he killed Simmons it must be because he was guilty of killing his wife. And I couldn't prove that. So he gets clean out of our hands? He never was in our hands. The other way around if anything. 0nly one thing that will bring him to heel. That is his own sense of decency. Decency? A murderer? Now look here, my lad. I know Philip Marshall. He is not a killer. Not by nature. He is a man just the same as you and I are. That's the reason I gave him that cooked-up story about Mrs Simmons. I didn't think it possible .. That he would let an innocent woman suffer for something that he did. But. It looks as though I was wrong, doesn't it. I would have made a bet that you were wrong all the time, Inspector. Sergeant. Do you still want to bet? Look. My hat is off to you, Inspector. Thank you, Sergeant. Shall I grab him? - No. He's getting away. - No, he isn't. He thinks he's done a pretty big thing. Let's leave him alone. He'll come to us when he's ready. Just keep an eye on him in the meantime. Where to, Guvnor? Scotland Yard. (Ro_S)
