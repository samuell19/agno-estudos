Every political heavyweight from the party is gonna be there checking me out. Jeanie's wedding is going to be wonderful. Fix your ascot. How come we never met this guy that Jeanie's marrying? -What's his name again? -Dudley Dawson. -Yeah. -Hey, I wonder if he's from the Schenectady Dawsons. They're a very powerful family back east. (snaps fingers) I went to school with Cap Dawson. -Talk about your blue bloods. -Isn't it just a little bit strange that Jeanie never brought, uh, what's-his-butt over here before? (scoffs) His name is Dudley. They only met three months ago. I know I'd be a shoo-in with the people if I could just get those old-money blue bloods to endorse my candidacy. And they'd be damn fools not to, Dad, irregardless of the fact that you are nouveau riche. Don't you ever use that phrase in this house! I am not nouveau riche. I am a self-made businessman. And I'm not your dad. I'm your father-in-law. Get it? Right. Self-made businessman. Father-in law. I-I got it. Can we please stop talking about the campaign for a minute? Focus on Jeanie's wedding. That's what's important here. Gaylord's right, as usual. -WOMAN: Hi, everybody. -Jeanie! -You look wonderful. -Thank you. I love that outfit. You do? -So, you excited? -Oh, yeah.

Oh... buns. -Give me buns! -(shrieks) -May I have them, please? -Stop it! -Give me buns! -Shh! No! Shh! Moo! Moo! My family is waiting to meet you. (groans) (gasps) Mommy! Tippy! Tippy! -What happened? -Mommy fainted. Gosh, are you all right, Mrs. Humphrey? Yeah, I-- She'll be fine. Can I ask you a question? Are you from the Schenectady Dawsons, railroad money? -Hmm? -Uh, no. The Detroit Dawsons. Sewing machine rental money. -There's gonna be an egg. Where's the kitchen? -Oh, to the left! -Are you all right, Mommy? -Yes, yes, I'm fine. I don't know what came over me. Oh! Sewing machine rental money? My God, he's a nerd! (all gasp) A nerd? How can you tell? There were a lot of nerds at USC. I can smell a nerd a mile away. Well, I've heard nerds make wonderful husbands. And they're smart too. She's obviously getting even with us for something. -Beef! We need beef! -In there! That was kind of a rocky start with your family. Oh, everything's fine. My mom's great. I'm sure she's just overwhelmed from all the excitement. -Well then, you don't think it's because they don't like me? -Booger, I love you. Well, yeah, I know you-- I got it! I know you do.

It stops the swelling. Are you pregnant? Pregnant? No! You mean, you don't have to marry him? Daddy! I would like you to come with me to a cult deprogrammer. J-J-J-Just show up there and be open. That's all I ask. I just can't believe you're saying this. (whimpers) Wh-wh-where are you going? This is good stuff I'm telling you. (sobbing) I love Booger! And I'm gonna marry him no matter what you think! (sobbing) Jeanie? -Sweetheart, you're overreacting. -(door slams) -What did you say to her? -Nothing. Nothing. We just had a little conversation, that's all. Ahh... Can't we all just get along? She comes home with a guy who looks like he came out of a vending machine, -and I'm the one who's wrong. -TIPPY: Jeanie. Jeanie. What a world. Hey! Hi. I'm Jeanie's sister, Gaylord.

I'm talking about the daughter you had 12 years ago, out of wedlock, with a young woman in Sandusky, Ohio. All right, Booger! Yeah, bud! You have a child that my little girl doesn't know about? I am appalled, Booger. Appalled. -And so is my wife. Right? See? -But-- I don't know anything about this. I have no child in Sandusky, Ohio. -The hell you don't! -(all gasp) This is a fairly specious charge. Where's your proof, Chip? Yeah, where's your proof, Chip? ALL: Yeah. My proof is right here. I'd like you to meet Detective First Class Chad Penrod. Detective Penrod, does Dudley Dawson, alias Booger, have or have not a 12-year-old child in Sandusky, Ohio? I checked the birth records in Sandusky and found that on March 19, 1981, a certain Heidi Dawson was born to a Miss Cathleen Turtle-- Turtletaub and a Mr. Dudley Dawson. -Cool. -Wait! If the parents of the alleged love child were never married, why isn't the child's name Heidi Turtletaub? Exactly. Why isn't the child's name Heidi Turtletaub? -Yes. -(neck bones crack) Beats me. If the child were born to an unmarried mother, wouldn't the so-said mother have given the aforementioned daughter her last name? PENROD: Well, I do know this. The child's nickname is Booger. -(all gasp) -Yeah! I think we should leave, Jeanie. Oh. Do you wanna marry a man who doesn't tell you that he has a child? Who knows what he'll lie about next?

Don't you get me started. -I heard-- -Word! I can't believe what got into you two. This is supposed to be a happy occasion. I'm especially surprised at you, Lamar. Now what was going on? Well, Chip was crackin' on Booger's parents. Crackin' on my parents? What kind of cracks, Chip? -Booger. -Yeah, what kind? -As your best man, I strongly advise you just let it go. -I'm not going to let it go. On the other hand, I'm prepared to explore other avenues with you as well. -What kind of cracks, Chip? -(stammering) Chip said that your mama was so ugly, that the Elephant Man paid to see her. (laughing) The point is you have a 12-year-old daughter in Sandusky, Ohio! This has nothing to do with my having a child in Sandusky, Ohio. That isn't what this is about at all. -This is because I'm a nerd. -(all gasping) And it has been since the beginning. Mm-hmm. Why else would someone rummage through my private life with a detective? And then announce this... detestable fabrication, this--this tissue of lies -on the happiest day of my life? -Oh, Booger. Hath not a nerd eyes? When you prick us, do we not bleed? I am tired of the reckless allegations, the snide snickering, the talking behind backs, the sly innuendos, the looking down on us.

All right, everyone, just cool it! -Oh, what the hell. -We've got too much class for this kind of crap. -Booger! -Jeanie! -Booger! -TAKASHI: (yells) Ahhh! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, haaaa! (woman shrieking) So you might have a daughter in Sandusky, Ohio, huh? (sighs) I don't know. It's certainly possible. God knows my seed is as strong as an Alaskan salmon. And I partied pretty hard in the early '80s. In Sandusky? Apart from Akron, I probably spent more time in Sandusky than any place on earth. Damn it! Everything was going so great. Now it's ruined. Ah, Booger. Your wedding isn't ruined. What are you talking about? We just had a food fight. People don't have... food fights at their... bridal showers! But I did. Some nouveau-riche guy, looked like he could have been a banker, is mashing... handfuls of garni up my nostrils! (sighs) I know things look bleak. But they've been bleak before. Do you remember at Adams College? We were exiled from the dorms and forced to live in the gymnasium. Do you remember in Fort Lauderdale, when we were persecuted into subjugation and incarcerated? How about when Orrin Price framed me... for embezzling... Adams College computer research funds? We may have been subjected to the yoke of nerd oppression before, -but we're not gonna be subjected to it again! -(bangs mug) This wedding is not over! The son of a gun has just begun! Come on, pal. (crying) (ringing) BOOGER: Meet me at the Wood Bridge in half an hour. Please? - Hello? -(sobs) I'm sorry. Is this 555-4264? Knock, knock. Is this a private party? Have a drink, Chip. Thanks, Dad--Aaron. (laughs) (sighs) I'm taking a lot of flack from this from my wife. I thought the, uh, food fight was a nice plus though. This is a career day for you, Chip. As a matter of fact, this is the first good thing I could ever remember you doing. Oh, come on. I've done lots of good things. Name one. -Are you serious? -Name one. Well, there was, uh-- -Uh-- -You don't do anything and I pay you a fortune. But look. You made up for everything. You're the man who drove the Booger man out of my daughter's life. (exhales) Daddy, I have to talk to you. I'm so confused. First of all, I just wanna thank you for being so concerned about me. I know in my heart you only want what's best for me, no matter what you say or do or how you behave. JEANIE: (sighs) I sure do love that Booger though. I can't believe he's got a kid he never told me about. (groans) (scoffs) Kids--you gotta love 'em. (exhales) It, um-- It is true, Chip. Is what true? That, um, he has a child with an unwed mother and all that? Yeah, sure it's true. The detective I hired found it. Because it, uh-- it wouldn't be good if it wasn't true. -It's true. -Then, uh--then it's good. -'Cause it's true. -Right. If it's true, it's good. And, uh, I feel good about that. (clicks tongue) Good. (birds chirping) (gasps) -Booger! -Jeanie! Let's go to our secret spot so no one will see us. -I love you, Booger. -Oh, I love you too. But marriage is about trust. No secrets from each other, remember? I don't have any secrets. Well, what about that child in Sandusky, Ohio? I don't have a child in Sandusky, Ohio! Well, why would Detective Penrod say that you did? Well, I don't know! I don't even know who Detective Penrod is! I'm a condemned man and I don't have a child! I believe you, Booger. You do? Yes, because marriage is about trust. And I trust you... completely. BOOGER: (laughs) All I know is that I love you and I think we should continue the wedding. Oh, Booger, I-- I don't know what to do. I-- I--I don't know. I don't know what's right or wrong anymore. I, uh-- I know it's a day early, but... I'd like you to read my valentine. (giggling) -Open it up. -(laughs) A cow. Oh. "An empty spot was on my heart until I met you, O Valentine. Then the spot filled in. My heart was whole. I could love for the first time in my life now that you are going to become my wife." -Ahh, the hell with my dad! -Uh, huh, that's exactly what I'd hoped you'd say. (laughing) (lowing) -Again. -(laughs) (lowing) (laughs) Oh, I can't tell you what it does to me to hear you moo again. -(lowing) -(mooing) (mooing) -Oh, ho, ho, Booger! -Jeanie! -(laughs) -(mooing) (lawn mower) -It's on! -What's on? The wedding is on again! First it's on, then it's off. Now it's on again. I am on an emotional roller coaster. -I am not a yo-yo. -(scoffs) -(lawn mower) -(tray slams) How can the wedding be on? We all can't even be in the same room together. Never in the history of weddings has there ever been a clearer case of incompatibility. Aaron, Jeanie is thrilled. Think about her for once. I am thinking about her. The man is a liar and a child deserter. If she goes through with this wedding, I'm not gonna have anything to do with it! Zero, nothing, nada, zip! -(chair ganging) -Ow! (laughing) Okay, all right. Anybody who feels that Booger could have an illegitimate child in Sandusky, Ohio, raise your right hands. (shouts) Opposed? -You don't think it's possible? -No, I do not. Booger may be Booger, but he always took precautions. -That is right. He always did wear condoms. -Oh. Condom. -So he couldn't have a child. -No way. (car approaching) -Harold, where you going? -LAMAR: I don't know, but I would guess Aunt Lois's. Are you scoring, Harold? Well, I certainly wouldn't tell you if I was. But I guarantee ya I ain't going over there for breakfast. (all laughing) -(tires screeching) -Ya-hoo! -(horn honking) -(tires squealing) -It's on! -BOTH: What's on? The wedding! -(tires screeching) -(horn honking) Uh, I-I thought you told me the love child was real. I didn't say she was real. I said it was a great idea. But it hasn't turned out to be such a great idea, has it? If Aaron finds out I've lied to him, I'm dead. He's gonna fire me. (sighs) Hey, if he fires you, isn't he also cutting off his own daughter? He's gonna give her an allowance that I'm not allowed to touch. Well, (lips smack) that'd do it. (moans) Oh, relax will ya. There are plenty of ways to ruin a wedding. -Such as? -It's easy. You know what bachelor parties are like. Beautiful women, liquor flowing, raw naked temptation. Booger's bound to succumb. According to his bio, he's got the self-control of a brahma bull. Uhh, how would we, uh-- How would we show proof of this? We'll make one of America's least funny home videos. -(chuckling) -(chuckling) Do it. Hey. There's a horse here named Big Booger. ♪♪ (groans) I missed the food fight. And now I'm gonna miss Booger's surprise theme bachelor party. Well, not really, Stan. May I present to you and Judy a special Valentine's Day treat. Try these on for size, ok? Now, tonight when the bachelor party starts, you simply turn on the TV, hit the function button on your remote. OK? And you might not be there, but you'll have the next best thing-- -Skolnick Vision. -(guffaws) -Bye, guys. -Thanks, Lewis. -Thanks. -(door opens, closes) (both guffawing) -♪♪ (dance rock) -(shouting, chattering) -Oh, I made it! -Great shot, Takashi. You know, you owe me another 20 bucks. -Huh? -Well, sometimes when you win, you lose. Now, let's play for your watch. -Okay, thank you. -You're welcome. (laughs) Red ball, middle pocket and you can call me London Fats. (chuckles) (party favors squealing) Ah, here you go. A bumper pool tournament! I mean, what an original idea for a bachelor party! I knew that you would love it, Booger. Is there gonna be a girlie show? Mr. Dawson, that would be sexist. Yeah, we believe it's possible to be entertained without demeaning women. That's nice. But personally, I'd prefer a little skin. Hey, hey, fellas, I got winners. (chuckles) He's got a lot of nerve showing his face around here. -Temper, temper. -Don't worry about it, Booger. We got him under 24-hour surveillance. There's nothing he can do that we don't know about. -(laughs) -(laughs) Hey, no lofting, Harold! (chanting) Nouveau riche! Nouveau riche! Nouveau riche! -Nouveau riche! Nouveau riche! -(gargles) I really expected Aaron to be here tonight. He doesn't want anything to do with the wedding. Well, he might have extended me the courtesy of allowing me to know that. (chanting) Nouveau riche! Nouveau riche! All right, all right, all right. All right! (chanting stops) Nouveau-- Now, I know we had a little trouble today at the all-you-can-eat nerd bridal shower at the Rump Roast Room at noon, but, hey, that's behind us now, right? -We're adults. -Hold it, everybody. -Lewis is right. -(coughs) Why, even I've been a bit of a recalcitrant during this wedding, but now that I've gotten to know... Booger, I realize that you and Jeanie are a perfect couple. And I know that it's only the first step, -♪♪ (dance rock) -but I'm hoping that you will accept... -MAN: Look at that. -...my dove of peace. -(excited chattering) -(party favors squealing) -Miss Modem! -(all cheering) -Miss Numbers. -Come on! (sighs) Miss Mainframe. -Leave it to Chip to be sexist. -M-m-me, me, me! -CHIP: Miss Communication. -(gasps) You know, they are sort of enjoyable. -CHIP: Miss Floppy Disk. -BOOGER: (moaning) -(moaning continues) -♪♪ -I love you! -Come on! -(all shouting) -(party favors squealing) Hey, hey, hey. -I'll take care of him. -Go get him. -Hi, Booger.

I just want you all to see what kind of lowlife Jeanie's going to marry. BOOGER (on TV): What is all this? Booger? This is anything you want it to be, Booger. It's your last night as a single man. You're allowed to have a little fun, Booger. Oh, my God. -I can't do this. -Everybody's nervous at first. No, no, no. It's not that I'm nervous. I am not nervous. It's just that, um, Jeanie and I have a special bond... and I don't want to break it. Plus, you make me very nervous. So, if it's all right with you, perhaps we could just... sit here for a, for a moment... so that the guys outside won't... think that I'm the sissy that you know me to be. -(laughs) -(kiss) You're not a sissy, Booger. You're a mensch. -I think he acted very responsibly. -That's right, Chip. -(smacks butt) -Oh, yes, Mommy! -Oh, God. (laughing) - Oh, I'm feeling better. -Ooh. -I've been bad. I've been very bad! I want a divorce, Chip. It must be a mistake. That's not me. Those nerds did it. I bet they did it on a computer or something. God, the things they can do with computers these days. No. I'm the one who made the mistake, Chip, when I married you. It was a little indiscretion at a bachelor party. It's not just the video, Chip! It's been all downhill since the honeymoon. You drink too much. You're mentally abusive to me. You fool around with other women. We have absolutely nothing in common. Well, maybe I could work a little harder. It makes me ill to think I've stayed with you as long as I have. (gagging) CHIP: Honey? You mind if I spoke to Chip alone? Oh, no, certainly. Come, sweetie. TIPPY: Gaylord! -This isn't good, Chip. -No. So I'm gonna kill you, Chip. You made a fool out of my daughter! Aaron, I can explain everything. You lied about the illegitimate child, then you tried to frame Booger and you got caught! The illegitimate child will be here tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m. She's on route right now from Sandusky, Ohio. There is no illegitimate child! You made it all up. The illegitimate child will be here at 10:00 in the morning! It better be! And you better get my daughter to forgive you, or there's no room for you in this family or at Humphrey Industries, you pervert creep. (door slams) Oh, boy. That was one heck of a stag party last night, Lewis. I know I'll never forget it. I especially enjoyed your dance with the woman who removed her clothes, Mr. Booger. Trevor, remember there's a code of silence about what goes on at a stag party. -Code of silence? -So, reveal nothing, even if you're under hours of interrogation and torture. Wild horses couldn't drag it out of me. (chuckles) Who aren't I supposed to tell? -Lewis. -Huh? There were women there, weren't there? Yes. Were they pretty? Yes. What'd you do with them? -The bunny hop. -That's all you did? -Yes. -Was the bunny hop? Okay. You can still be my valentine then. Oh, Betty. (sighs) You shouldn't have. -He's so cute. -He plays something too. Beautiful. (chuckles) Hey, guys! It's Valentine's Day! ALL: Happy Valentine's Day! Happy Valentine's. Aaron, I hope you didn't have anything to do with videotaping Booger at the stag party. Absolutely not. I wasn't even there. Mm-hmm. Aaron, if you don't participate in this wedding and make your daughter proud of you, I'm going to leave you. You would leave me? I have learned a lot from the nerds. Nerds speak their mind. And from now on, I'm gonna speak my mind too. If you don't support your daughter during this wedding, I'm outta here. Fix your ascot. It's not like I'm giving up that much. What is that supposed to mean? Aaron, we haven't had sex since the Bush administration. Well, it's, uh, hard to perform in that way when the Democrats are in power. Ask any guy in this neighborhood. That's why the sex hasn't been that hot lately. Hot? I'd settle for lukewarm. Zip your fly. (zipper screeches) Well, it's not all my fault. How can I have sex when I have to spend all my time fixing my ascot, zippering my fly and matching my socks? I can't be perfect for you anymore, Tippy. It's too much pressure. Aaron. I thought I was helping you. I know how much you wanna be accepted by the blue bloods, but you don't ever have to be perfect for me. -I don't? -No. I just want you to be the imperfect animal I fell in love with. You mean it? Absolutely. Tippy. Aaron. Oh, Tippy. Aaron! Oh! Oh! Oh!

Nerds. Who knew? -Where are you? -Well, I'm over at Lois's. Well, it's been special. And thank God it's all going to end this afternoon. It's all gonna end right now. I'd like you to meet Heidi Dawson, your daughter. Go. -TIPPY: Oh, Aaron! -It's off! (gasps) -What's off? -What? The wedding! Booger's kid turned up. I told you there was a kid. -Guys, the wedding is off. -(gasps) It's not your fault. You didn't do anything. You didn't ask to be born. Would you like me to give you a push on those swings? -No, thanks. -Mmm, I'm a pretty good swing pusher. I could give you an over-the-top. I'm too old to be pushed on the swings. Oh, right. Yeah, you're too old for that. I used to hate it when people treated me like a baby. -You did? -Oh, yeah. So what do you like to do? I'm afraid to tell you because if you don't like what I like, then you won't like me. I think... I'm going to like you no matter what you do, as long as you live. So there. (tires squealing) (car door closes) -Booger. -I'm here to see Jeanie. I'm sorry, Booger, but Jeanie doesn't wanna speak with you. I would like her to tell me that. Well, if she doesn't wanna talk with you, she can't very well tell you then, can she? Mrs. Humphrey, I am trying to be civil, but now I am not asking. I am demanding to see your daughter. Oh, Booger. I'm sorry. Oh, honey, help him. Booger, every wedding has its crisis. This is yours. A crisis would be easy compared to this. Jeanie! Oh, Booger. Booger, the groom never stops pursuing his bride. Never. Hey, pal. Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Hey, wait, wait a minute! Hey, wait! (whistles) Hey! (groans) (grunting) JEANIE: Oh. (grunting) (exhales) -Booger! -Darling! Whoa! So what if I have a child. I'm so confused. You know, I just I don't know what to think anymore. Oh, marry me, Jeanie. I just need a few days to think about it. What, not get married on Valentine's Day? I'm confused, Booger. I need time! There was a time when getting married on Valentine's Day was the most important thing in the world to us. Please go, Booger. Is that what you really want? No. Not in my heart and not in my soul, but... I'm just so nuts over this, you know. It's like I just need a little space. Please, Booger? ♪ Jean ♪ ♪ The roses ♪ ♪ Are red ♪ ♪ All the leaves have gone green ♪ ♪ And the skies are so low ♪ ♪ You can touch them ♪ ♪ And so ♪ BOTH: ♪ Come into my arms ♪ ♪ Bonnie Jean ♪♪ (giggling) It's on!

It's unreal how much you remind me of my friend Bing. I've never met anyone quite like you, Lamar. (giggles) Well, I'll take that as a compliment. It is. -Lewis. -Booger. I'm gonna marry Cathleen Turtletaub. Who's Cathleen Turtletaub? Heidi's mother. But you don't even know Cathleen Turtletaub. I know, but it's the right thing to do. -(coughs) -(hisses) This really isn't about Cathleen Turtletaub, is it? No, it isn't. This is about your zapatos becoming muy frío, no? -Lewis. -Booger. I didn't go through with it with the stripper last night. -Oh, yeah, we know. -How do you know? (smacks lips) Well, we kind of figured it out when we edited the videotape to ruin Chip's life. Here I was passing up this mound of perfect. I, who have never passed up anything in my life. What is the matter with me, Lewis? Where has the Booger I have known and loved... gone? (clock chiming) You ready? Let's do it. (glass hits table) Please be my valentine. You haven't given me a valentine in 10 years and this is what you come up with? Pathetic! (nervous chuckle) (whimpers) Aaron, Tippy, the food fight was a sensational idea! I'm gonna use the nerd theme at my wedding. (guffaws) Mylan. I'm so sorry for all the trouble that you've experienced with this affair. Thanks for coming to the wedding. I do not care to judge you, Aaron, on the basis of the hell I've been through. But I trust that it was merely a horrific aberration and I expect the wedding to be quite different. What? Oh. I, uh, trust that'll be enough. Wouldn't have missed this wedding for the world. LEWIS: Everybody, stand aside! Make way for the groom! (horn beeping) I would know that horn anywhere. -LEWIS: Dad! -U.N.! -Hey, how are you? -Hey! -Congratulations. -Thank you.
