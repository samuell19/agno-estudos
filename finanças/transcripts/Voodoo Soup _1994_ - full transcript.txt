(upbeat jazz music) (door creaking) (spooky organ music) (fire crackling) (tribal drumbeat) (children playing) (wolves howling) - Oh! (gasps) Oh, fire. Oh, somebody, fire. (children yelling) - Ow, ow. (gasps) Fire, oh please, somebody help me. Fire, ow, fire. - Stand back, stand back, never fear, Cookie is here. Oh my God, what is this? (blows) Okay. What was that supposed to be, anyway? - Well, it was baked Alexis, but... - Oh, you burned yourself, wait a minute. Here, hold this. Give me your finger. - My God, you're Cook! The Cook. Your sunscreen, I use it ever day. It changed my live. - I'm so glad. Have you tried the new morning shade? - No, how does it work? - Well, it's the latest rage. Use it just like wallpaper. Hang it up over the windows. Now this plastic is specially coated to stop 110% of those killer morning rays. You can even paint it. - Listen, I'm new in town, just starting out. And I'm told that you know Sylvina. - Well, I do all her cooking. - Really? - Well all the top vampires in town are my clients. Why? - Well, I'm a new vampire just starting out, and I need to join a family. - A vampire? Oh boy, Sylvina hates competition. - I know, that's why I need your help. (thunder) - I don't know, you're not exactly the right type. - What do you mean? - You're look is all wrong. Sylvina would never stand for it. - My look. What's wrong with my look? - Oh for crying out soft, that old sickly, half head, black fingernail polish look is out. - Really? Since when? - Where have you been hanging? The Transylvania look this season is glamour, classy. - Look, you know Sylvina of Transylvania. You can tell her about me. I'm a great vampire, really I am. - You've got a lot to learn. - Teach me. - Me? I don't have time. - Please, oh please. - Under one condition. - Anything, I'll do anything. - That's the condition. - Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. (kisses) Thank you. (kisses) (disco music) (squishing) - (sighs) Thanks, I always wanted to try that. - (laughs) Now it's your turn. - Okay, next we need to work on the bite. - Okay, I'm ready. - Okay, pretend I'm your next victim, lock me in the bat stare, and go for the throat. Just pretend, now. - Of course. (clears throat) (disco music) (sighs) - Wrong! Wrong! Jeez, you watch too much TV. - Sorry, I'm new at this. You have to show me. - (sighs) Okay, look, the whole thing should be pure ecstasy. When Sylvina looks at you in the eyes you feel warm all over. And the bite, it should be slow and gentle. - Really, slow and gentle. Then how do you get your victim to hold still? - Well, three bites and they're immortal, right? - So? - Soooo, you're giving them strength. They love it. - Oh, I never thought of it that way. - Here, let me show you the difference. Now this is the way you do it. (disco music) - Roar! - Yes, yes, I love it! - Oh, no, no, no, no, it's not the classy European style. - It's not? - No. Okay, now this is the way Sylvina does it. - You'll be gentle with me? - Very funny, now pay attention. - Okay, how's this. - That's good. Now, look directly into the pupils of their eyes. Get them to relax. - Oh, that's nice. What are you doing later? - Will you be serious? - Okay. - Now, that's it. Next kiss them gently on the lips. - Like this Ahr. - [Both] Mmmm. (squishing) - [Cook] That's it. (disco music (squishing) You got it. Now, work slowly down the neck. - Oh, so I don't scare 'em, right? - Right, your learning, your learning. Oh, this teaching stuff is great. - Uh, now what do I do? - Now the bite has gotta be subtle. Pretend you're sucking a golf ball through a garden hose. (laughs) Ow! Just kidding, just kidding. (disco music) (squishing) (disco music) Wow, Sylvina is gonna love you! - Really? - You'll fit right in. - So, you're gonna tell her about me? - Well, sure. - Great, thank you. Now, here's my picture and resume. The photos are kind of the old one, but I'm getting some new shots soon. - Fine. Look, I left a little lite lunch for you in the oven. Just give it a minute, no more, on high. - You're leaving? - You don't need me anymore. - Don't say that, I... - Look, it's no good. I'm a 90s kind of a guy. You have your whole death in front of you. Now don't worry, I'm gonna keep an eye on you, kid. (pouts) (water trickling) (wind blowing) - Hey, what about dinner? - [Cook] Just call out and have something delivered. (sighs) (rock music) (dial tone) (rock music) (door bell ringing) - Boy, I am famished. (rock music) Just a minute, I'm coming. (rock music) - (sighs) Oh, great, a lesbo. I need a drink. You got any rum? - I think so. Sit down, and I'll be right back. (rock music) (plop) (fizzing) (rock music) There's your drink. - Thanks hun.

I'm trying to find some new stuff for my secret recipes. - When do you leave? - I'm catching the redeye out tonight. So, how's living going? Has Rowena bagged any more vampires? - Oh, she's tracking a couple now. She ought to have 'em staked out by the time you get back. - Sylvina sure keeps her busy. - I hate competition. This town is getting overgrazed. We can't have the game disappear, now can we? - I guess not. - I hope you're taking along a guide this time. We can't have anything happen to you. Who will cook our victims? - It's no problem, I'm goin' club dead. - Hey, cool. (creepy music) - Come back to us. - Hey, ey, ey, not the bat stare. Why do you have to control everybody you meet?

Body guard work. - What, Sylvina? - Yeah, you know her? - Well, hell yes, I do all her cooking. - Small world. - Yeah, listen, I gotta get going. I'll call you when I get back, all right? - All right, that'd be good. I'd like to get some shootin' before the rainy season comes. - What rainy season? This is California. - Hey, anything I'm supposed to know about Sylvina? - Well yeah, just don't eat with her. - I'm a good cook, but they like the weird stuff. - Monkey brains, trite, blech. - Well, brains, yes. - Hey, get outta my way, will you? - All right.

Your night will come. - When? I'm getting tired of waiting on you hand and foot. I want my own slaves. - Mm. Yeah, construction workers, probably. - Just because you like wimps. (junk clattering) - You're such a bitch in the morning. - Thank you, I try. By the way, Rowena says she saw Cook downtown selling voodoo soup to a band of werewolves, and she thinks that he's cooking for other vampires too. (junk clattering) - Rowena will hunt down those fleabag wolfmen. And I have a plan to find the location of the rest of Cooks new clients. - Cool, what is it? (laughs) - Cook's best friend. - Dic Butkyse, the private detective? - Mm-hm. - Wow, tricky. - He's great at finding people. Whiles Cook is Africa, I'll suck Dic's neck three times. - Right, he can tell us who cooks new clients are. Wow master, you're so smart. - I know that. We'll clean the house in one fell swoop. (junk clattering) Just send the detective out to me. I'll be out in the spa. He'll be mine before Cook returns.

Your jungle is being burned down to make coffee plantations and cow pastures. Soon, you will hunt the flesh no more. Hey look, why stay here and be wiped out? Why not do what ever other tired and poor people do? Emigrate to America. Back home I'm known as quite the cook. I own a catering company. I supply all the local cannibals. You move the tribe, I'll supply Sunday brunch. Why stay here in the jungle and starve to death, when you could come to America? (frog croaking) Where you accepted not on the basis of what you eat, not on the color of your skin, but you're ability to pay taxes regularly. (frog croaking) (fire crackling) (monkeys chattering) Come on guys, can't you see I'm sleeping? - Chief sent me to take care of you. - Come on, I don't need somebody to take care of me.

I thought I'd have her for lunch. - Good idea. - Hey, what's with the fish? You know I'm allergic. - Well I picked them up at the animal shelter. They're gonna feed 'em to the piranha. I thought I'd bring 'em out here for target practice. At least then they'd die like men. - Cool, I get the white one. - Oh, I think he likes you.

I sent her ahead to protect Cook. Good cooks are hard to find, you know. - I see. - Cook, he's a real nice guy. He cooks for all the local man eaters, and he could always use another client. - Rowena caught him poaching over at East Beach. - My God, not the happy hunting grounds! - That's the place. Apparently, Cook ran into these guys on his jungle herb safari, and now they're here. - Holy shit, we must find this slut. - Don't worry, I'll get Rowena to take care of her. - No! Wait. (sighs) (thunder) Cook is the only cannibal chef around. I'll get Dic to find her for us. Cook will never suspect his best friend. - What about this guy? - This guy? You can keep him. I'm not hungry.

Call me when you lose a few, and maybe I'll have you over. - Well, I'd like to have you over. Over my knee. Whoa! (dishes clattering) (glass breaking) (tribal drumbeat) - I love him, why can't I tell him? - Tell him what, that you're a blood sucking vampire? - He'll understand. - Anyway, he's not our kind. You should marry one of your own people. (army trumpet) Jeez, what's that for? - Bigots. - Now, you wait just a minute! - Cram it, bozo. Not our kind? Where do you think you are, back in the jungle? This is America damn it. (clapping) (explosion) - Isn't she great? My little blood sucker the citizen. - You mean you know what I am and you don't care. - Hell no, you're perfect.

She's been missing two days now. You simply must find the poor dear. - Why not go to the police? (fire crackling) (sighs) - To be blunt, if Patricia dies all the money from her trust fund goes to me. I'll be the first one the police will suspect. You must help me. - What ever you say. - Clown. (fire roaring) (classic rock music) (humming) (sighs) ♫ Do do do do do do ♫ (laughs) Oh, golly.

So, what's up? - Well, I got this new girlfriend, see. - Yeah. - And every time we make love, all she thinks about is biting my neck. - Oh, I see. - I thought if I could find something to distract her. - Now, you've come to the right place. Come sit down. - Okay. (classic rock music) - Now, this is one of our more popular items. It's called Cream Me. - How does it work? - Here, let me show you. (classic rock music) Now, say we're making out, right. - Uh, like this? - Yeah, that's right.

You pack in the stuffing and sew her up. - Remember to eat non-fat. - Oh bite it. Kidding. I swear to God I was only kidding. (laughs) (rock music) - You know, uh, I just want you to know I'm a former member of the police department, and I think this is definitely kidnapping. Kidnapping could get life to torture and death sentence. You know that, you know that. - Do you like men in uniforms? - [Bo Peep] I love men in uniforms. (rock music) - Well that's really not bad, and you're really quite something of an artist, but I really-- - [Madame Butterfly] Come on, hold still. - I think you should reconsider. - [Madame Butterfly] You have the butterfly on yet? - No, I'm workin' on this-- - Oh my God! - We'll get the wings done on yours. - {Madame Butterfly] Okay. (groans) - I have money, I have money. I can see that you're not impressed by that. My grandfather ran a chain of hotels. Big man, left me lots and lots of money. And I don't like butterflies. - How 'bout flowers? I like flowers. Pink ones. (rock music) - It's getting a bit nippley in here. - Please! It only takes a little, please.

Painting, they're painting! - Ooh. - Help! - [Bo Peep] Will you be quite. - Yes. - [Bo Peep] I stick my bra in your mouth. - Help! You know I'm remembering that film when everybody died when they got all painted. I'm really kind of concerned. Have you checked out whether this is toxic? - [Bo Peep] Oh, yes it's very good paint. - [Dic] Really, I can appreciate that this is the... Look, I'm just a guy, I'm just a guy. I do a job, I go around, I wear a hat, I wear a raincoat, I watched Hawaii Five 0 when I was a kid. Please! (rock music) No! Help me! - [Bo Peep] You know, I used to were a raincoat, remember?

Hey! - Hey, who are you? - [Cook] Get outta here! - Hey. - What the hell was that all about ? - Oh man, they're in love, I tell ya. They just won't leave me alone. - Really? - Oh God. - Why don't you wait for me outside. I'll be along in a minute. (rock music) You guys have a little trouble deciding what sex you wanna be, eh? Let me help you out. (sawing) (sawing) (rock music) (sighs) Oh, don't worry, guns don't kill people. (gunshots) Bullets kill people. (shells hit floor) (sighs) - Hey, thanks.

I'm so hungry I can dog meat. - [Cook] Let's eat. - Honey, Dic want's dog for lunch. (snorting laugh) - Eh, maybe next time. - [Cook] Always the joker. (rock music) - Sweetheart, where's Misty? - In Heaven, I hope. - Oh, shut up. - I can't figure it out. Why would Sylvina say that Patricia is her long lost daughter? - [Cook] I don't know. - Well we better find out. - Well, thanks for lunch. I think I'll mosey over and have a little chat with the lady. (cat meowing) - What are we gonna do? (cat meowing) This locket belonged to Chief and he'd never have given it up. - Look, don't worry. I'll go out and find Rowena. We'll straighten this mess out. - Be careful. - What for, I'm immortal now aren't I? (laughs) (spooky organ music) - Sylvina, the drapes for the den look beautiful. - Painting soothes the savage beast. (spooky organ music) - The door. I'll get it, it might be my romeo, ooh. (spooky organ music) Well, hello there, don't you look yummy today. - Oh, get a life would ya? - Okay, how 'bout yours? - Call me later, babe. - Sylvina's on the patio, but she's very upset today. - Well, so am I. - Well, so am I. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the refrigerator cooling off. (sighs) (spooky organ music) - Look you, why did you tell me that Patricia was your daughter? - We have no time for those stuff now. Look into my eyes. - What is it, what's the matter? Let me help. - Shh, listen we are running out of time. This is a photo of my real daughter, Rowena. She has gone after them herself. She's no match for a vampire, and a heart of a headhunter. You must find her. Stop her before it's too late! If she's caught, they'll trace her back to me. Do you understand? - Well, not exactly. - What? - There's no such thing as vampires. - Oh, really, then what am I, Josefina Pla? (growling) (creepy music) (slurping) He's all mine now. He'll take care of that bunch, and no one will suspect us. Take him back to town. Now we have to find that fool Rowena. - That's three pal, you're history.

The thing that bugs me, is I can't get Patricia off my mind. I know I've seen her someplace before. - You said she was from out of the country. Why don't you pay a visit to your old partner, Captain Dickweed, and maybe he'll let you look through the immigration files. - That's a good idea. - Maybe something will jog your memory. - Speaking of jogging, you're looking fit. Here, let me check out your body fat. - Don't you touch me, you creep. You think I don't know where you got those hickeys? - You missed me, you missed me, now you gotta kiss me. Oh Betsy, saved my life again. Hickeys, what in the hell is she talking about?

But I'll tell you what, for $50 I'll make you holler. - Oh, lucky for you I'm a cop, and you're under arrest. - Wow, looks like you, a cop? Wow, they just take anybody now a days don't they? - Alright, that's enough. You have the right to remain silent. Just to make sure you do. - Oh, I suppose that's how you will all your arguments. - Hey, state regulations require all dogs to wear muzzles at all times. (dog barks) - You know, while you're at it, why don't you put a blindfold on me too, so I don't have to look at your ugly face. - Oh, you're just afraid you'll fall in love with me, eh? - Afraid I'll lose my lunch. - Yeah, I got your lunch right here. - Yeah, well I'm in the mood for a meal, not a snack.

I don't really like the sun that much anyways. - Oh, you're just not used to it. - Yeah, you're probably right. You know, I'm really getting hungry. Do you mind if I take off now? - Sure, what the Heaven? - Oh, thank you so... - Relax kid, not the hair. - Okay, well thanks. - And another thing, don't let me catch you whoring around here 'til after dark.

Sooner or later Sylvina will control him completely, and he's gonna lead her right to us. The Chief even said that she's afraid that we are going to overgraze her hunting grounds, and she'll stop at nothing to get rid of us. - Look, I've told you before, I fed him my human breast sandwiches. He's locked. He's one of us now, why kill him? (sighs) Wait, a mind is a terrible thing to waste. (rock music) (sighs) - Please, please kill him for me. (sighs) Just this one time, I promise. I will never ask you to kill again. Please? Look in my eyes. (laughs) - It won't work. I don't expect you to understand. But us men, we're out there in the freezing cold for millions of years killing mammoths and dinosaurs, while you women stayed at home and watched soap operas. Our bond is stronger than any vampire stuff. We have a code. You stick by your friends. - He will kill you. - Maybe, but Dic and I go all the way back to ballet school together. I won't kill the only friend I have. - Okay, okay, fine. (pot boiling) Oh look, we got something from the Chief. - What does it say. - He says that the rest of the tribe's gonna be here on Sunday already. - Sunday?

I was wondering if you can help her out. - Of course. - You think? - Sure. - All right. - What seems to be the problem? - It's my career. - Oh that's too bad, a lot of stress, huh? - Oh yeah. - You know what you need is my secret electrical conduit pathway massage where we connect you with the universe. - Oh my God. - Why don't you come back to the office. - Okay. - All right.

(sighs) - You believe all that stuff? - I don't know what I believe anymore. All I know is now that I found you, I'm never gonna let anything happen to you. - Don't you worry about me.

My, aren't we stiff? I know what you need is a little adjustment. - Oh yes, please, I have trouble with my neck. - All right, here, lie down. Now, let's get you relaxed.

That's all your gonna get. You're not turning me into your slave. - What's the matter, afraid of blood coming out your nose? - Hey, look, I'm a 90s kind of a guy. You're on your own. (laughs) - Look silly, a vampire chooses only one true mate. And with the third bite we become one. You'll be safe. - And happy? - Forever.

He's dumping in broad daylight. - Government building. They're all politicians and bureaucrats. He's just another cannibal here. - Wrong, he's just another dead cannibal here. - Be careful, I'll get the blood sucker. - Payday Cook, you're all mine. ♫ Get this feeling when your gone ♫ I think of how it used to be ♫ I know you're comin' back to me ♫ I know this feeling can't be wrong ♫ Oh oh, oh oh ♫ Each morning, each morning ♫ Oh oh oh ♫ Each morning, each morning ♫ Look what you done ♫ I think of how it used to be ♫ I remembered you in love with me ♫ I get this feeling when your gone ♫ I think how used to be ♫ I know you're comin' back to me ♫ I know this feeling can't be wrong ♫ Come back here you filthy cannibal! - Will you just hold it for one minute? - You're one of us now.

California blonde breast, with the nipples removed, of course. - [Dic] Whoa, this immortal stuff is really true? (sighs) - Ain't it great? - Ow, yeah, oh. - Wait a minute, what happened to your neck? - Oh, that bitch, Ah! Sylvina. - Sylvina from Transylvania did that? - Yes. - Holy... - Hey, the Pope. - Shirt, she's a vampire. - What? - Three bites. - How did this happen to me? - Oh man, they stare into your eyes and suck you dry before you know it. Believe me, I know. Pat's a vampire too, only she's a half breed. - What do I do know? - There's only one way to deal with a full blooded vampire like Sylvina. You must eat her heart. (scoffs) Or be her slave forever. - Ah, I love her daughter Rowena. - Rowena, she's okay I guess. Although she's a little high strung. (laughs) - Well she's a little gung-ho. I left her back at your place. We should go get her. - [Both] Pat! (thunder) (hurried footsteps) - What about my clothes? I wanna look my best for Rowena. - You can change in the car. - Like, like Batman. (hurried footsteps) - He got it from us, come on. - [Dick] Whoa! - [Cook] Go! (thunder) - [Patricia] Mf, hi boys. - [Both] Hi boys? - Where's Rowena? - Gone to get a movie, said she'd meet you back at her post. - (sighs) What about my neck, damn it. - I've explained Sylvina's hold over Dic. - Yeah, says I gotta eat her heart. - What? - Uh, you better get going. Rowena hates to be kept waiting. - Yeah. - I'll take care of Salvina. - That's good, 'cause vampires give me the creeps. (hisses) No offense. Well, I guess you'll need this. - Hey, how do you like your heart, medium, or well done. - [Dic] I'm gettin' out of here. - Oh boy, what a day. (groans) - You tired. - Oh yeah. Hey, you wanna take a shower? - No. (laughs) - Hey, come one, I'll pay you. Uh, you take a check. - You have any ID? - ID, I know I got it with me here somewhere. There was all this shooting today. Oh man, what a day I'm havin'. - Honey, I'm home. (water bubbling) (thunder) What a terrific set of videos. These are my favorite movies. (gunfire) (whipping) (gunfire) (tribal drumbeat) (church bell rings) - Oh, hi. - Hello Sylvina, hey, I'm cooking at a boom ceremony, and I thought maybe you'd like to come along. - I would love it. - Good, good, it'll give us a chance to have a nice long chat. - What's on the menu. - Menu, oh, heart. (howling) (spooky organ music) - Yuck, what is this? - It's my recipe for bat flambe. - Okay, no more mister nice guy. (growling) - Oh boy, this is gonna hurt. (thunder) (spooky organ music) (screams) (growling) - Ah, I'm melting, I'm melting, I'm melting. (sizzling) (tiger growling) (bubbling) - You're mascara's running a little bit, but you're not melting. (sighs) (baby crying) (upbeat jazz music) - (sighs) Where am I? - You're not so tough without your make up, are you? (upbeat jazz music) (sighs) - You saved me. I'm pretty again. - Remember, beauty's only skin deep. So if you go around looking like a monster, people will treat you that way. They can't see the beauty that's underneath. - But you can? - I'm a gourmet, I have to be able to tell if the apple is rotten on the inside. - That means I'm not rotten? - No, you're just lonely. - Everybody hates me. - What do you expect, the way you go around killing them all the time? - But I'm a vampire, I'm supposed to eat people. You know that. - I know nothing of the kind. I've been feeding you cow for the past two years. You only thought they were human. - Cow? How could you? You are Hindu. You worship cows, don't you. - Three meals a day. (groans) - Here, drink this. It'll make you feel better. (cries) (cow mooing) (sighs) - Maybe I don't really need to eat people. - You really don't, trust me. (sighs) - But I was going to have two wolfmen for dinner. - Well now you can have them over for dinner instead. - Friends? Why, you're so wonderful. How can I ever repay you? - Well, Dic is in love with Rowena. You're still a vampire. You must release him. - What can I do? - I need your heart. - My heart? I'm ready to pay. Be an instrument of revenge for all of those I've harmed needlessly. (upbeat jazz music) - Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord. (water trickling) Oh, thanks for coming on such short notice. It's a tough ceremony, it takes two people. - Well, what is it? - Oh, there's a man coming over. He really needs help. - Oh there's a man. Here, no, no, I have to keep my whip. So where is he? - Now just step on in, we gotta condition the water before he gets here. - Well what's in the water? - Oh, fresh herbs spices, cinnamon. - Cinnamon, oh yeah, what else? - Holy water. - Oh! (sizzling) (birds chirping) - Feel better? - Wow, wonderful. - What's she doing here? - Don't worry about it, it's holy water. It's safe. Trust me. (upbeat jazz music) Oh go on, don't be a baby. - [Dick] Ah, damn. - Okay, to remove vampire bites, oil of clove, and a little slap of garlic. Hold still. Okay now, careful, this is gonna burn a little. (birds chirping) (screams) Rub it in, rub it in. - Ooh ooh hoo hoo. - All right, where was I? Okay, now it says you gotta submerge all the way under the water for 30 seconds. - Oh well, but I don't know how to hold my! (gurgling) - Wait a minute, it won't even work. Hold on, be right back, I need a battery. (gurgling and splashing) - Ah! (gurgling) (gasping) (gurgling) (splashing) - Okay, 30. (sighs) Care for an appetizer, sir. - Yummy. I want my freedom. - Bye Sylvina, thanks for the memories. (upbeat rock music) (groans) - Oh God. (groans) (sighs) - I don't get it. Pat's a vampire too. Why don't you have to eat her heart? - Oh, I made all that stuff up. Eating a vampire's heart won't do any good. - What? - Shh. - You mean you killed Sylvina for no reason? - I didn't kill her. - [Dick And Wrenfield] You didn't? - Hell no, who do you think's on bass? (upbeat rock music) - Hey, if that's not Sylvina's heart, what have we been eating? - Oh, it's my latest recipe, cow. (cow mooing) (growling) (howling and barking) (groaning) (cow mooing) - [Dick And Wrenfield] Oh! - Blech. (cow mooing) Ah! Gah! (cow mooing) - You gonna eat that? (cow mooing) (squishing) (laughing) You know, we really gotta talk about this biting thing. - Oh. - It's starting to get on m nerves. - We're all through with that, see no more fangs. - What happened? - Silly, once a vampire bites three times she becomes mortal again. - What about me? - You too. - Why didn't you tell me? I could've been killed. (laughs) - You watch too many movies. - Hey, you can never watch too many movies. - I'm hungry, what's for dinner. - What do you think? - Soup? - Soup. - Soup, it's always soup with you. - Soup is good for you. - I need meat. - Oh, I got your meat. - Ow! I'm just kidding. (laughs) You know, you hit hard for a broad. (smack) I mean person, person. (laughs) - That's better. - Yes.
