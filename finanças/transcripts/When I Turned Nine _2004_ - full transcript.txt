Woo-rim.. lsn't that Yeo-min? Yeo-min! Yeo-min! Get out of the way! We have to take them to the hospital. Yeo-min, are you ok? l'm ok. How's Woo-rim? She'll be alright. Don't worry. She's been sleeping for a while. She'll be up soon. She's little hot. All this happened because of a rabbit. Why did she chase after a rabbit? l'll make sure accidents like this never happen again. - l'm very sorry. - Please. Don't worry about it. - Teacher! - Yes. May l speak with Woo-rim's mother? What is it? Hello, ma'am. l'm Woo-rim's friend Keum-bok. Woo-rim's father must be very worried about her. Of course. He's also worrying about her in Seoul. She doesn't live with her father? No. He's a doctor in Seoul. So no one lives in America? ln America? No. She's never been to America? No. Why? Nothing, ma'am. You're still talking about America here? Don't pay much attention to her. She's just curious. - Go home. - Yes, sir Teacher. - How do you feel? - OK. - Are you awake now? - Yes, sir. - Can l go home now? - Home? - Are you well enough to go home? - l'll be ok. - Are you sure? - l'll be alright, ma'am. Yeo-min, thank you for what you did today. l didn't really do anything. l heard from your teacher how you saved Woo-rim from drowning. Come over sometimes. l'll make some food for you. Ok? - Yes, ma'am. - Good. l'll go get the nurse. - Are you gonna be alright? - Yes, sir. Didn't l tell you she's a liar? l knew it from the beginning. Do you want me to tell you why she moved to here? Why? Cuz she got busted for all her lies in Seoul. You know? - No, l don't know. - Hey, you guys stop for a sec. Come here. l have a favor to ask you. No way. You want us to keep our mouth shut, right? Right. As soon as l go to school tomorrow, l'm gonna make a grand announcement. Thinking about how much she put me through, l can't keep it as a secret. l'm sure she has her reasons. Please do this for me, Keum-bok. Fine. You know, your love for Woo-rim makes me wanna cry. How about you, Chil-soon? Don't worry. For some reason, l feel bad for Woo-rim. Aren't you gonna ask me? l trust you. Yeo-min. What? Are you all better? l'm good. And you? Good.. Thanks. Don't worry about it. My dad always said men have to protect women, no matter what. That's why l did it. Not because l like you. You like your dad that much? Of course. He's the greatest. l envy you. Why? Don't you like your dad? No. Why not? Just because.. Teacher's coming! What day is tomorrow? Fall Picnic Day!! Quiet down. No one's gonna be late on a picnic day, right? No, sir! Whoever comes late tomorrow will stay in school and clean the toilets! Ok? Yes, sir! - Ok? - Yes, sir! BAEK Yeo-min, you're next! Yeo-min, get up there! The pine tree of llsongjung have faded, faded, faded away.. But the stream of Haeran River flows for 1000 years.. You're pretty good at singing and dancing. You think? l was just kidding around. Are you mad at me? Why did you pick on me in front of everyone? So embarrassing.. You think singing in front of your friends is embarrassing? l did it for fun. You don't do stuff like that. Like what? What are you afraid of? l don't care what other kids think. This is so boring. Do you wanna do something later? l'm busy. You're always busy. - ls it heavy? - No. Tell me if it is. l'll carry it. l said, no. Are we there yet? Almost. Why is it so far? What are you doing? Climb over. You expect me to climb over this? Why can't you? l can't. Ok. Then walk around that way. That's a pretty flower. Yeo-min, can you get that flower for me? Here. lt smells so sweet. Do you know what that is? What is it? lt's a wild chrysanthemum. - l wish it was summer. - Why? Then we can pick wild strawberries and berries to eat. What is this smell? Do you smell that? No. Woo-rim, lift up your shoe. Oh my god! What is this! Get it off! You did this! This is all your fault! What are you talking about? Don't worry about it. You can wash it off at the stream. You think stepping on poop is ok? Then what is not ok with you? You wanted to show me this disgusting place? This is so gross. l'm going home. Give me my bag! l can't believe you brought me here! Who do you think l am? Bastard! Why she couldn't do that before? Darn, what a temper! You're getting it all wet. Just let me do this, ok? Why you gotta talk so much? Give it to me! You can't even clean a shoe! Go over there. Man.. You are such a.. You're getting it soaked. Your point is? l would've done a better job. lt's my shoe, so shut up! Whatever you say. lt's not me who's gonna walk home in a wet shoe. Thanks for caring. lt's you who made me step on poop. l did not. You stepped on it yourself! You're the one who brought me into the woods! No. You said you wanted to go into the woods. Mr. SHlN, you've done a wonderful job with kids. l knew it from the beginning that this drawing had potentials. lt stood out from the rest. Our students have so many talents. l agree with you. l've been hearing good words about you and your guidance with kids. You're too kind. ''Child Catching a Dream''.. That's a wonderful title. You must often talk to you students about dreams. lt's very important to have dreams as a child. Of course, sir. l talk about it in every class. l always tell them how important it is to have dreams. So how did you come up with this title? l meant to write ''Child Catching a Bream,'' but l must've written it wrong. ''Child Catching a Bream''? l see.. What do you mean by ''Child Catching a Bream''? My sister likes to eat fish. ''Child Catching a Bream''.. l wonder where he learned how to draw so well. People used to tell me l'm a good drawer. Really? ln any case, it'll cost some money to send him to art classes. Don't worry. We'll manage to give our kids proper education. Let's just sleep. You must be exhausted. Sleep well. Mom, l'm home. Where are you coming from? From school. Where did you go after school? l was playing with my friends in the woods. Now you're lying to your mother? Lift up your pants. Now! Are you still gonna lie to me? l'm not lying. l was playing in the woods. You've become a compulsive liar! Since when did you start selling ice cream bars? Everyone in the neighborhood knew except me! l'm sorry, mom. Who said we need you to go sell ice cream bars? Who told you to count poop buckets? ls that what you're gonna do when you grow up? Why did you sell ice cream bars for? l did it for fun. You carried around ice cream bars all summer just for fun? No. l needed some money. lf you need money, then you ask me. What you need money for? l wanted to buy you glasses. Who asked you to do that? Are you embarrassed of your one-eyed mother? Did you think l'd be happy if you bought me glasses with that money? No, mon l just didn't want kids to make fun of you, mom. Honestly. l'm not embarrassed of you. Shut it! Stand up straight! l'm so sorry, mom. l'll never do it again. l don't care about your eye. l'm not embarrassed of you. Honestly. Please believe me. l don't care about my missing eye. Do you know why? Because l have you! Don't you know that already? lf you do it again after all this, l'm just gonna end everything! Do you understand? l'm sorry, mom. l'll never do it again. And l'm really not embarrassed of you. l'm so sorry. You fool.. l'm so sorry, mom. l'm so sorry, mom. - Who the heck is BAEK Yeo-min? - Come out right now! There he is. Are you BAEK Yeo-min? Come up to the back hill after school. Our Captain wants to fight you. Understand? Let's go. Yeo-min, don't go. l don't like fighting. Are you gonna go or not? Ok. Ok, what? Yes or no? lf you go, it's over. Why is he not coming? ls this the right place? Yup. - Then where is he? - There they come. Hurry up! Move your butts! How come you sissies came instead? ls he scared? He ain't scared. We can't accept you as our Captain until you beat Yeo-min. That's right! Gorilla. Gorilla? You little.. Do you wanna die? No, l don't wanna die. How can l fight him if he's too scared to even show up? Bring him over right now. l'm starving. You only got water? You really want to fight Yeo-min? That's right, you little snots! Hey, Yeo-min! l heard you mom is a cripple with only one eye! Do you have time after school today? Let's go out to the woods again. l didn't get to show you the secret base last time. l'll show you everything. Don't talk to me. Why not? Didn't l tell you it's over if you fight? l didn't have any choice. Really. l don't like you anymore. How can you say that so easily? lt wasn't easy. Who's talking? What makes you think that l like you? l don't like you either. Take this pencil back. l don't want it. l really can't stand moody snots like you anyway. l'm gonna pretend l didn't hear that. No. You heard me. You heard me sound and clear. Give this to Yeo-min. Can l get one more for my brother and my sister? - Sorry. - C'mon. Please? Alright. What the heck. Ki-jongl, you're the best! Yeo-min, here! How come you have two? Ki-jong gave me another one for my brother and my sister. Keum-bok! What? You spat on my food. l did not! You just did it again. What are you talking about? l didn't spit on your food! You're crazy! Crazy? Yes, crazy! What's wrong with you? What are you looking at? ls she really crazy or what? What are you doing? Mind your own business. Stop it, both of you. Woo-rim, just let it pass this time. Yeo-min, what did you just say? l told Woo-rim to let it pass. Why don't you just let it pass! JANG Woo-rim! Hey, JANG Woo-rim! You lying snot! l know your secrets. l don't have any secrets. Are you that rich? You can throw away food like that? Why do you care? Can you move? You asked for it. l'm bleeding! You're so dead! What are you guys doing? You again? Keum-bok! What are you, a bully? Why did you beat her up? She's the one who started it! Shut up! Get out of my way! She punched me! Are you ok? You traitor! - Why are you always on her side? - Where is my bag? My hat? Let's go. Keum-ok, go home. You're gonna pay for this! You're here. Come in. Why did you call me again? l know. l know. Come in first. l need you to do me one last favor. l don't want to. - Sit down. - l'm gonna go, sir. Sit! l have my own problems too. - You little brat! - l'm wanna go, sir. l said, sit down! Kidding. l was just joking. Bitch! l'm gonna kill her! Give me the letter. l'll bring it her. Forget it. Give it to me. That's ok. lf l don't give this letter to her, then you're gonna hate her, right? l can never hate her. l despise myself for not being able to hate a shallow person like her. l don't even know myself. - You only have $1.10. - Yes, sir. Bring 20 more cents. l know your situation and l'm not making any profit out of this. But, l have to sell it at cost price. Sir, can l get the sunglasses first and pay you back the rest later? l can't. lt's still business. Sorry but that's all l can do for you. Bring 20 more cents, ok? Here. - Thank you, sir. - Bye. - You can't find it? - No, l can't. - How much was it? - $1.10. That much? That's a lot of money to lose. What are you gonna do? - Woo-rim, look in your bag again. - Yeah, it must be somewhere. Raise your hand if you took the money or if you saw anyone take the money. Everyone raise their hands! No one's going home until the thief is caught. Raise your hands high! Put down your hands quietly if you took the money. BAEK Yeo-min! What are you doing here? Nothing, sir. Follow me with that. Exactly $1.10. Woo-rim lost $1.10 and you hid $1.10. Are you still gonna lie to me? Teacher, l really didn't steal it. Then why did you hide it? l was afraid of getting accused because l had the same amount. - What's this money for? - Teacher, this isn't my money. l had 11 10 cent bills. l didn't have any coins. You really are a sly little thief. Do you think l'm a fool? You had all this planned out, huh? Everyone knows you can easily get change for the bills from any store. You had it all set up in case you got caught, right? Tell me the truth! l knew it was you who took the money from the beginning. The letter, then the shoes incident, and now this! lsn't it obvious? Now, tell me the truth! Sir, someone saw me with this money. Who? The optician. Why did you go there? l wanted to buy glasses. What for? You don't even have bad eye sight. l know. Then what? Are you trying to confuse me? lf you didn't steal it, then how did you get it? Where did it come from? lt took me a long time to save that money. You expect me to believe that? Are your parents that rich? Rich enough to save $1.10? l don't think so. Bring your mother to school tomorrow. You hear me? Answer me! Yes, sir. Teacher, l'm sorry. l forget l put the money in my social studies book. l thought l lost it. l'm sorry. What did l tell you yesterday? Didn't l tell you to look for it carefully? l'm sorry. - So you found it? - Yes, sir. Do you kids think this is funny? Go back to your classroom. Do you know why Yeo-min didn't beat you up? Because you wear glasses. Whenever he sees your glasses, he thinks of his mother. You said he stole the money? Do you know what kind of money that is? That's the money he saved to buy glasses for his mother. He sold ice cream bars and cleaned houses for that money. How can you say he stole that money when you don't even know anything! Get out of my face, you bastard! Bitch! You make me wanna puke. You've never been to America and your father lives in Seoul. You mother told me this. lsn't that right? Say something. Are you still gonna lie about it? Your father sent you your book bag and pencils from America? l knew everything but l didn't say anything till now 'cuz Yeo-min said you must have reasons why you had to lie to us. Did you really lose the money? How can l believe you when you lie about everything. l bet you lied just to get Yeo-min in trouble, right? Say something, you lying snot! Why are you crying? Woo-rim! What are you doing here? Did you not come to school because of me? No. l just didn't feel like going. Rabbits aren't eating 'cuz you're not there. l think they're sick. They're not sick. They're gonna have baby soon. That's why. l'm sorry. That's ok. You came all the way here to tell me that? Because we grow up looking at.. green mountains and trees.. and clear blue sky. One, two, three, four! lf we could color in our hearts, it would be green in the summer. Because we grow up looking at.. green mountains and trees.. and clear blue sky. Woo-rim, did you think about what l said? Why are you acting like this? Can't you please try to understand? No, l'm not going. l can't go. lf you don't want to go, then stay here by yourself. Fine. l'll live here by myself. Can't you see your father is trying to make things work out? We moved here because you didn't want to live with him. lt was because of you. We moved here because you two were fighting so much. l thought things might get better if you lived separately for a while. lf you came here because of me, then stay here. l like it here. You can go if you want to. l don't ever want to see him again. Alright, alright. - l bet 2 on One. - l bet 3 on Two. l bet on Two, too. Didn't you guys hear something? From over there. Hear what? Just keep playing. Yeah, hurry up. Alright. lt's Three! - Give me all your marbles! - l lost again. Attack! Woo-rim, what are you doing here? Alright. That's it for today. You guys go home. Why? We still have more to go. Captain's order. We're done for today. l thought you didn't want to be our Captain. Keum-bok, didn't you hear his order? Let's go. C'mon! Woo-rim.. lt's freezing out here. Why are you sitting here by yourself? Let me see your face. Get up. lt's too cold out here. Come. Everyone! Bow to the teacher. Good morning, sir. Today, Woo-rim is moving back to Seoul. - You all must be sad to see her go. - Yes, sir. Woo-rim, say a few words to your friends. On my first day, l was surprised l was the only one wearing white socks and most of you were bare footed. lt was also weird to see that many of you didn't wear slippers. You all remember my black shoes that Yeo-min ruined, right? Yes. lt was my favorite shoes. Because it was the first present my dad sent me from America. ln my house, l have lots of American clothes and pencils and stuff. My dad sent them to me from America. Quiet! Do you know what kids called me when l lived in Seoul? They called me UFO. Unpredictable Fearless Open-mouth. To make it short, they called me UFO. Everything that came out of my mouth was a lie and no one knew what to make of what l said and what l did. l bragged about my dad in America, right? l know some kids laughed at me whenever l did that. To tell you the truth, my dad doesn't live in America. And he didn't buy me any of those American stuff that l bragged about. He lives in a far away place. A few years ago, he went to America on a business trip.. and died in a car accident. Before he left, he promised me he'd come back with lots of presents. Until now, l always made myself believe that he's still alive. l believed he's with me all the time and watching over me. l thought, if l talked about him everyday to my friends, then maybe he'll come back to me in real person. But, l'm gonna let him go now. Now, l won't have to talk about American pencils and American clothes. Please forgive me for lying to you.. about everything. lt feels good to tell you the truth. l felt horrible about lying to you. l thank you all for everything. l'll never forget you guys. - Done? - Yes, sir. Now.. Wipe your tears. l'm sure you'll do well in Seoul. You should go. Your mother is waiting outside. Turn to page 112. Like a flickering light, the love grew dark so quickly.. The love from the earth will last forever in the starry night sky. Anything else? He said, ''Goodbye, my lad.. Goodbye, my earth woman!'' But l don't know what he meant by that. Did he say anything else? He looked at me with tears in his eyes. Then he told me to go and he went into the mountains. l don't know. He was acting all weird today. Yeo-min, do you know why it's sad to leave someone? Why, sir?. Once the person is far away, you can't do anything for her even if you want to. Woo-rim! JANG Woo-rim! Who is it? Who's there? How do you do, ma'am? Hi, Yeo-min. What bring you over at this hour? l'd like to speak with Woo-rim, please. Sure. Come inside. lt's cold out. No thank you. lt won't take long. Can you please call her for me? - Are you sure? - Yes, l'm sure. Alright. Hold on a sec. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Woo-rim, your friend is here. What's up? l'm BAEK Yeo-min. l wrote you a letter before. And told you that l liked you. And that one day, l will reveal myself to you. You still like me? Yeo-min, what are you doing here? Nothing. Did Woo-rim leave? She just left. Oh, she told me to give this to you. Aren't you gonna go? ln a bit. - Then l'm gonna go first. - Why? My sister told me to come home early to shovel up the snow. Alright. l'll see you later. Dear Yeo-min, by the time you read this letter, l'll be thinking about you on my way to Seoul. To tell you the truth, l really liked you a lot.. But everything l sad and did came out the opposite of how l felt.. l was thinking about what l wanted to give you as my present.. and l found out who is the number one person on your list. lt was your mom. At that moment, it didn't bother me that l was your number two. l hope you like what l got for you. lt's something you really wanted. Yeo-min, l will never forget you. l mean, l can't ever forget you. Goodbye. From a girl who can reveal her name.. JANG Woo-rim.
