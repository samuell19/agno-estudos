Hey… Go away! How dare you! I really regret that I am married to you, do you realize that?! I deeply regret that. I bet your mother is very pleased now. Her prayer has come true. She never wanted us to have a child, right? Answer me! Don’t blame others. Who is the sick one?! Who is the one who suffers relapsing illness? How can you talk such nonsense like that! You passed on your illness to her. This child was stressed because she had been abandoned by her father. So, I am the one who should be blamed? Yes. You are the one who is sick, and I get blamed for that? It has no correlation with me. Are you satisfied?! Not hard enough?! Slap again! Slap again! Shut up. It is your fault! It is your fault! Don’t, don’t. Don’t ask me to leave, she is my child. Let me go, go away. Sis,Sister. Sister. Hello, Dear. Dear… Yes, dear… Where are you? Dear? What happens, dear? Dear? Maybe we are not destined to have a child now. Please don’t say that, dear. I am tired. I want to take a rest. I don’t want to think any more about finding ways to have a child. I don’t want to think about that anymore. Dear, you should not lose hope, dear. You must be strong. I believe you can do it, dear. It has been three times, three times that I had miscarriages, Adi. I know, but we have not tried all available measures, dear. You never think about me. You never think about my health. You only have one thing on your mind. How to have a child. I feel that you are marrying me only to have a child. Adi, listen to me. We, indeed, have a big age gap. I am younger than you but it doesn’t mean that I am stronger. No. This makes me sick. Dear… Dear Let’s find a home for us. But why you choose here, dear? You must have acknowledged that the house prices in here are expensive. Dear, this area has a nice atmosphere, Dear. Just relax. I know that we have limited savings. But you need to relax. So you will get healthier. Okay? I’ll go inside to get the brochure. Dear, do you like it? It is nice, but are you sure about this? I already paid for it. You bought it? We can afford it. This is for us. Okay? I love you. Come on, let’s go. Ohh… my God. Hello? Hello, have you arrived yet? Yes, Boss. Make sure that everything works. Water and electricity. Don’t miss anything. Yes, don’t worry. If you have checked all, don’t forget to lock all the doors. Who is that? Mom. Di, explain to me. Why does your wife feel uncomfortable living on the same roof with me? Am I a monster or what? Why do you think like that, Mom. It must be about the household chores, right? Di, am I wrong to remind her to be more diligent, …to be more attentive in taking care of the house. She is your wife. It is a wife’s duty to take care of her husband. You know about Kirana’s condition, Mom. You are aware of that, Mom… I’ve told you, Having a young wife does not guarantee that she will easily get pregnant. Wherever you live, as long as your wife is sluggish… …she will not be able to conceive. Trust me. Why am I always blamed? No one blames you. Just get over it, Mom, we have discussed this many times. Mom, Kirana and I just want to be more independent. Having our own house. Building our own family. I don’t agree that you are moving out. I have taken Kirana to stay at a hotel, Mom. All of our stuffs have been moved. So everything has been handled, Mom. In here, you can relax, dear. The air is clean; the area’s privacy is maintained. The security and cleanliness is good in here. Okay Here it is. Come on. Come on. It is nice, right? Go inside, take a look around. Sorry, dear. Sorry, dear. Dear… dear… It is dusty in here, dear. Dear, do you need an inhaler? No. I am okay, Di. No Dear. Yes. I just bought a stove yesterday. You will feel comfortable cooking any kind of dishes with this, Its flames will not put out easily, unlike the old stove. Don’t get too tired. Dear, I bring some your tools… Dear… Where is your inhaler? Are you feeling better? Here, I bring you painting set. You can place it anywhere you like. Later, we will find a room to be used as your painting corner. Dear, I hope you will draw pictures again like you used to do. So you can be happy again, and relax again. Okay? Dear, Only for you, I have the guts to do this. I realize that I was wrong, I had been forcing you to stay with my mother. I know, I know. This is a new chapter for us, okay. BABY CLOTHES. I’ll store them on the back. Dear. I just talked with a security officer at the front, He told me that our neighbor was a doctor. I have asked his phone number, so we can easily reach him if anything happens. Good morning. I have prepared the breakfast downstairs. I’ll come home early. I’ll be here by afternoon. Don’t forget to always keep your cellphone close to you. And also, there are two inhalers in the drawer Okay? One more thing, you must not carry the boxes on the front. That is my job. All you need to do is relaxing. Take a good rest to restore your health. If you are feeling better and fresh, we will switch places; I will be relaxing. Yes I love you. Dear, Love you. Dear… Yes? Do you want me to throw them away? Don’t do that. Dear, it is still in good condition, why should we throw them away? Chocolate? Yes Right? Of course. Wait. You did not have an acute asthma attack when cleaning the house, did you? I was bored, dear. I was alone in the house. What should I do other than that? Don’t clean the house by yourself. Okay, but why you talk that way? It’s ugly. Be careful, dear. Do you want to take a bath? Yes Wait. I’ll boil the water for you. Yes Dear, Want to take shower together? Dear, Dear, Dear. Who is that? Who is that? Hi dear, are you waiting for me? What happened to you? What is wrong, dear? Hey, what is wrong? Come on. You must have been cleaning the house again, right? You also changed the light bulb? Come on, sit down. Sit here. Try to relax. Let me prepare some food for you. I missed you so much. Dear, you didn’t miss me, did you? Dear, it almost six months that we haven’t… Do you feel tired? Let’s eat then. After having a dinner, you can take a rest. Where is the sugar? Thank you. This is you, right? Dear, take care. Bye. This is the umbrella, it’s raining. Dear… I love you. I love you too. Bye. There is no need to use the umbrella, dear. The rain has stopped. Don’t do that, you will get a cold, dear. You will be the one who cures me then. SISTER. Dear…. Ohh… I woke you up, try to a sleep again then. Sleep. It is okay. Just take a sleep. Have you had your dinner yet? Yes, with friends at the office. Dear… Hmmm…. What? I love you. I love you too. Morning, dear. Good morning. I can’t laugh. I can’t stop…, Can’t laugh? I can’t stop laughing, dear.

Dear, what is wrong with you? You just need to say yes. This time, please accept my request. Dear, I don’t like this kind of thing, dear. She is kind. She will not harm us. Trust me. She? Yes, Sister. Whose Sister is she, dear? Here’s the thing, Will you only be willing follow my demands after something bad happens to me? You said that you were happy with the new me, you are happy to see me now. Yes, yes, yes. You just need to say thanks to Sister. I want to be here, I don’t want to live at your mother’s house. Who is Sister, dear? Who is Sister? I am hungry, I want to have a breakfast. Dear! Hey, dear. You’re still up. Usually, you sleep at this hour. Do you want to watch DVD, dear? Dear? Positive? I am scared, dear. Dear, I am here with you, dear. We will protect it together. You should be happy, why do you look gloomy? We’re going to have a child. We’re going to have a child. Thank you, dear. Dad. Hi, dear. Why you have woken up, dear. Today is Sunday, why do you need wake up so early. I am just in the mood to wake up, dear. What do you want me to cook? See… Dear, there is a lot of dusts, dear. Just stay the room. Go inside... There is an inhaler in the drawer. Just stay in the room. But if you have done cleaning this up, tell me. I will. Where is the dust pan? Oh… it’s downstairs. I will grab it. Sister… Sister, go help Dad, okay? Dear… Yes? Let’s eat. Come on. I am starving. Sir, there is stagnant water, Sir. The pipe is clogged. Oh… clogged. Oh… wait a minute. Please check it, Sir. Okay… Let me check it. Okay. There is something clogging the pipe. Yes, this is clogged, just like a stuffy nose. Wait, Mam. Yes, Sir. It will take a minute, Mam. Sir, I will cook here if that’s okay with you. Of course, Mam. It’s okay. Sorry, Mam. Ouch! Be careful, Sir. Yes… yes… yes. Eh a falling chicken, falling chicken, falling again. I’m sorry, Sir. Yes, sorry… Sorry. Falling chicken, falling chicken, and falling again. Sorry, Mam. It is okay. Don’t worry, Sir. It’s okay. Sister, Sister, you shouldn’t do that. Don’t be naughty. He is working. After cooking, we will play again. Okay? Eh… Mam, pardon me for asking this. Yes Do you have a child? Not yet, Sir. After sweeping the floor, we will play… Mom… Don’t get too tired, Mam. It is better, if you are on bed rest. Do you have a maid in here, Mr. Adi? Ehh… No, Sir. Oh… Mr. Adi. I suggest you to put away stuffs that absorb dusts from her. What kind of stuffs, Doc? Such as a stuffed toy, rugs... ...and also she must not do the house cleaning chores. Because you are sharing your body with your baby. So, even though you are not doing any activities, your body is still working. And one more thing, Sir. If you have an acute asthma attack, your energy will be diminished by half. And it is risky, Sir… The previous residents of this house also had an asthma. I mean the resident’s child. The child? What a poor child, Mr. Adi. For most of the time, she was accompanied only by the maid. That’s why I asked you earlier, do you have a maid or not? Because she need to be accompanied all the time, Sir. I’ll find someone to accompany her. So what happened with the child? It’s late at night, Mr. Adi. Just call me if you need anything, Mr. Adi. Okay. I’m living close from here. Yes, thank you, Doc. See you then, Sir. Yes, tomorrow is okay. Okay. Thanks. Who did you call, dear? It was Mom. I asked her to accompany you here. I don’t want that, dear. Dear, you heard what the doctor said. Yes, but I don’t want your mother to be in this you. I’d rather to be accompanied by someone else, other than your mother. Dear, looking for a maid is not that easy. It needs time. There is Sister, there is Sister. Sister can accompany me here. Dear, could she take you to the hospital? Or calling me if something happens to you? She can’t, right dear? Why you become ill like this? It is because you cleaned Sister’s room, right? You must not be selfish, dear. Why you said I was selfish? You are the one who is selfish. I am selfish? Dear, do you think that I am a plant? That only need to be placed in one spot and sprayed with water? A normal husband won’t let his wife befriends with a ghost. With a devil. Okay, divorce me then. What are you talking, dear? Since we got married, I become more stressed. If I could choose, I feel happier before marrying to you. Before marrying to you, I was free, I was happier. Free? Dear, you become sick and suffer shortness of breath, because you used to drink and smoke a lot. You should have been more grateful, dear. Whatever, dear. You can say whatever you want. At least, I was once an independent woman. Not a spoiled brat like you. Mother’s boy. Di, why there is few furniture in here? What, Mom? Furniture in your house, very few of them. Kirana and I want it to be like that, Mom. We don’t want our house filled with too many stuff. This kind of arrangement is already perfect. You only need few furniture, or you don’t have money to buy more? Where is Kirana? She is upstairs, Mom. Okay. What happens with Kirana, Di? Kirana is not feeling good, Mom. I told her to rest. She is not feeling good, or she is reluctant to welcome me? Mom… Di, whose room is this? This will be the baby room. Your room is there, Mom. Di... Di, I will stay here. You'd better not, Mom. Ehh... It is dusty in here, I am afraid you will get sick. You'd better stay here, Mom. No problem, I will clean this room a bit. Please, okay? Bu, I prefer you don't stay here Mom, okay? Come on, Mom. Hey... What's wrong? Does your wife forbid me to stay here? It's not like that, Mom... I'm thinking about your health. What if the dust makes you sick, Mom? Please, let me stay here. Up to you then, Mom. Dear, burn all of these. We still have a lot more in the house. Come on, dear. Hmmm... That's right. What are you doing?! Don't! Give them back to me! No! Those are rubbish. You have asthma. Give it to me! Give it to me! Dear! Give it to me! Give it to me! Adi is not here. Dear! Mom, please. Dear! Dear, Dear. Dear, please open the door, dear. Dear, please, dear. Come on. Open the door please. Di, come on have a dinner, Di... What did you say to Kirana, Mom? What are you talking about? I said nothing to her. Dear... Dear, open the door, dear. Please forgive Mom, Sis. Forgive me. Sheila... Sheila, I will sell your cellphone... ... If you don't help me. Come on here! Sheila! Di, Di... Sis, this is Ms. I want to talk to Sister. Mean. What did you do last night? You should've not been naughty like that. Sister is a little girl. You should be a nice, smart and beautiful girl, dear. I know that you love me dearly, but don't... Where is she, Kirana. Where is she?! Okay. Show yourself! Face me if you dare! Adi. Come here you, bastard! Dear, dear. You must not defend a ghost. Just defend the living one. Hey... She is not a ghost, she is my child. She is not your daughter, but a ghost. I don't care if you perceive her as ghost, devil or genie. She is my child. She always protects me, Adi. You should not defend her like she is your own child. She is just somebody else’s child who died here. Where is she? Hey stop. Stop. Hey stop! Hey, hey you are pregnant, you are pregnant. Have you forgotten that your children died. I'll never forget that. Your three children have passed away! I know that. One died at the hospital, the second one in the house, and the third one died on the street. I know, there are my children. If Kakak died and turned into a ghost, what differentiate her from children? I always care about Sister. Is there anybody who cares about our children at the places where they lost their lives?! This is my only fear. I am afraid that no one loves our children there, Adi, you need to understand that! I was wrong. I am the one who made them died. They lost their lives because of me. I made them died. No. All of them are dead because of me. No. It's not true. They passed away peacefully. You don't understand, you don't understand. I know. I know. No, Adi. Stop it. They need me, you'll never understand that. You know nothing. I know. You will never understand. Yes, I know. I know. Dear... dear, take a breath. Dear, take a breath. Dear, sit down... Take a seat here. Sit down here. Wait a minute. Take a breath, take a breath. Take a breath, don't inhale too much of it. Okay. Dear, our children's death is not your fault. Not your mistake, nobody's mistake. You are an amazing wife, dear. You are a great mother. Our children were lucky to be loved by you in their brief lives. I miss them, dear. I miss them. I'm yearning for them, dear. Me too. I feel the same, dear. All we can do now is sending them our prayers. Dear, Sister is a child. If she is angry... You saw what happened to Mom... Dear... Dear, Dear... Listen to me first, dear. Dear, please listen to me, okay? Sister is easily upset. I don't want anything bad happens to our child. What are you talking about, dear? What do you mean? Dear, please prioritize our child. Protect our baby, dear. I'm asking you to use your logical thinking. Who do you prioritize? Our child... Our Sister. I love you. I love you too. Mam... Mam… Excuse me, Mam. I often saw you observing my house. Who are you? I am sorry for having interrupted you, Sir. Not at all, Mam. Excuse me, Sir. Do you know about Sister? Who is Sister's real name? Eka, Mom. Eka? Yes. She was the most cheerful child I had ever met. What happened to Sister, Mam? Her mother tried to have an abortion several times. But Sister was strong until she was born. But the drugs taken by her mother resulted to Sister's deteriorating health. Sister was often sick, which eventually led to her death. I prayed every day so that Sister would be given to me, Mam. I was okay with that. But what should I have done? Her parents tended to argue rather than take care of Sister. So, you still meet Sister until now? Every day, I always spare time to come here. Although it is just for a moment. I know what I have done is wrong, Sir. But Mam, please don't forbid me to meet Sister, Mam. I have a question for you, Mam. Has Sister ever harmed anybody? She is just a child, Sir, his emotion is still unstable. Mam, whenever you want to visit, don’t hesitate to come. Yes. Thank you, Mam. Thank you, Sir. Excuse me. Okay. Excuse me, Mam. Okay, take care then. Dear, What is wrong with you? Dear, I don't want... I don't want to take any risk. Tommorrow, we will move out. Why should we move from here? Dear, I don't want anything happens to our baby. There are only two choices, we move out and let Sister stays here. ... or we stay and expel Sister. Dear, Sister has the lady to accompany her. Our child needs you, To always protect him. Our child is more important than Sister. Okay? What do you want for dinner? Let me cook it. What happened, dear? Dear... Oh, what happens to you? Dear, let's have a dinner outside. Dear, come on... We buy... Come on, come on. Use my slippers Sister... Just leave... Come on. Sister… Dear, your feet. Dear, your feet. Let me treat it. Don't worry about it. Are you okay? Walk slowly. Ouch. Sister, Sister, Sister. Dear, dear, dear. Dear, dear, What happens to you, dear. Ouch. Dear, my water just broke. The water broke, dear. Ouch, dear. Sis. Go. Go away! Go! Dear. Dear... Come on... Go away! I can't stand it anymore, I can't stand it. Dear, go upstairs... Upstairs, okay. Go away, Sister...
