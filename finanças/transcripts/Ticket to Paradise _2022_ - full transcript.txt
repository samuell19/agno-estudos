I used to do things like this all the time He's never done anything like this, it's just the opposite of his nature Is anyone going to pay 45 thousand? Probably the only time David surprised me was when he proposed to me It all lasted 4 years, she was in college I was doing graduate studies in architecture, and I was living in Chicago. Then all of a sudden I got an offer from a great art gallery in Los Angeles. - I'll pay 70 grand. - We have 70 grand. and a night before graduation She told me she was leaving, so I acted calmly and pretended I was happy for her Totally collapsed Then the next morning, we were at the graduation ceremony and I was walking towards the dean of the college Suddenly I found David... beside me on his knees Then she started crying I felt so embarrassed The place became noisy, everyone applauded and kept cheering except for her parents Their opinion was that she was still young And that I could have a better chance, but who would listen to his parents' advice? Sold to Georgia To cut it short, you didn't travel to California. A month later, I was pregnant with Lily. That's cool, but since when did this happen? Let me count the years On the 7th of next March, it will be 25 years reasonable? Marriage for 25 years Oh my God, I didn't mean marriage Oh my god, no Divorce happened after 5 years The divorce was not amicable as you see on TV I'm not trying to be in the same place but Lily will graduate tomorrow and here I am This must feel silly What? No, it's a big catastrophe Well, tough predicament Account please What do you do? I pack my things. You pack my business stuff. Don't pack business, why would you? Because it's a small holiday followed by a long life Yes, I was thinking about this, and I don't think an adult life would suit me I really don't have a choice Hello momy I'm steaming my robe now and wondering where I'm going to sit at the ceremony It doesn't mean I'm interested, I just... I don't care at all Then why... wait a minute, Dad is calling - Hey dad, mommy's on the line. - Don't give her my peace. You're not going to be sitting together, you're going to be sitting far apart in a room the size of Rhode Island. It is the smallest state So, do you promise to avoid any vile comments, arguments, or indirect aggression? What about direct aggression? Is it allowed? I love you I love you It will be an unbearable day Come on, we'll shake an old man's hand and put on a stupid hat, don't worry They will sit together On behalf of the college, staff...and people from different cultures We welcome the parents, families and friends of our graduate students You must be joking Yes, this is my seat, since you haven't dated a woman since Lily wore braces Because when I'm dating a woman she has to be right for my age You don't like him because he's French I love the French, and I love French fries and their toast And that's exactly reason enough not to sit down together This is pathetic. - Shut up. Don't ask me to shut up Without further ado, let's start by honoring student Rain Butler. Yes Yes Excuse me, it's my armrest No, it's in the middle You always take what doesn't belong to you - It's just a metaphor. Student (Lily) - Take a picture of her. - I won't. I don't want to take a picture to document the moment. - I love you. - I love you more. - I'm proud of you. - I'm even more proud - I'm prouder. - I'm even more. I'm the most proud person ever - She waves to me, loves me. - She waves to me. I love you, Lily I can't believe my daughter has become a lawyer. - You know what I'm capable of, Mom. - Stop yelling at me. - Who's yelling? Here we are It seems that someone suffered and stayed up a lot last night Maybe one or two of them, the other six are cool It's a long trip to Bali, you can sleep on the plane Lily can complete her work on the plane She had at least 90 hours of auditions last week In 3 months, she could join a big company in Chicago. One must train well before joining the labor market She shouldn't be under pressure, and you should calm down You ask us to calm down when you've never been able to make anyone calm down before I know that - you know that There are voices inside me that warn me of upcoming disasters, but I will be fine I hope you will support me at least once in your life I could, but then I'd be wrong too Well we have to go Did you see what I did? I hastened to say goodbye - who did that? - - Yeah. - It wasn't just him. Bye-bye. It wasn't just me Bye bye dad I love her so much Goodbye Lily's mom and dad because I haven't seen my dad since I was born I love you, take care of yourself - Be slow in your decisions. - I do it all the time. - I do it rarely. And now she's gone - See you later, I hope it never happens. - I hope it's not soon. "to paradise" Enjoy your time, you deserve this vacation "Is the wifi good?" (Journey to Paradise) This place is amazing I think we should live here - You're exaggerating. - I'm really thinking about that. Don't you really want to... Hey Where is the compound? My God No, no, it's okay We can swim well How far do you think it is to get there? - In miles. - about 400 miles? - I can't figure this out. - Well, let's go, come on. - Lily. - What?

Welcome Hi, I need some help here What do you do in your life other than getting lost at sea? I'm a lawyer I will be when I come home, I'm a fresh graduate - That's interesting. - Do you think so? Don't you think so? ...I mean...just me I have been trying all my life to reach a certain goal in front of my eyes And here I am, I wonder if this is really the right goal No, it's too late I can't back out now I can't let everyone down Who will feel let down? My parents, for example And who else? I don't know, I think it's just them what about you? What is your story? I work in a seaweed farm This is not enough Perhaps you should ask specific questions My dad was a seaweed farmer and his dad was before him And what about the father before them? he was a hunter There must be a change Why are you looking at me like that? Sorry, I just have...this crazy feeling I feel like kissing you right now But don't worry, I won't do something like this all of a sudden The water is warm Well Do you have some time to talk? Don't worry about this I wish I could work in a bathing suit It's not a job, but I'm working with one of the guys here You will see for yourself All we have to do is cut these plants out of this part No plastic tools should be used Farmers don't use it, then we put the plants in the container Nature guides people Follow it and you will never regret it I completely lost my balance You can find your balance here (Los Angeles) (Los Angeles) After 37 days It's a brutal comment on the evolution of freedom in our society But look closely, you will find...the basic sympathy that I think it's the other way around Oh really? Excuse me I'm at work David I don't have time Of course you have time, unless you've been working as an oncologist since the last time we spoke There you are, underestimating what I always do Don't underestimate what you're doing Check your email I'm already checking it and I've blocked you - Lily sent us a message. - Whatever happened, you caused it. is what? Thank you! This is Flight 576 from East Los Angeles, we're at your service Thank you for your time. We welcome all Los Angeles passengers. Would you like a glass of champagne? Two glasses, please. I only drink wine when I fly My name is Beth Ann Flannery. I like to make friends with the passengers next door To help me get out of the wreck in case the plane crashes I have two kids and I don't... Excuse me, I need some peace here, please, okay? Excuse me, madam, I think my things are on your seat Sorry Come on You must be joking Do you speak English Still doing the trick of the Italian tourist Excuse me madam, I want a seat other than this Sorry, there are no seats available - We were married. - They were the worst 19 years of my life. We've only been married for 5 years - recovery period included. - I can't sit here. - I can't help you. I'll switch my seat with you, my dear Just remember, if the plane goes down, you owe me to save me I told you that I will bring it in 4 days... My daughter will marry a young man she met millions of miles away from her home Sorry, did my sentence conflict with yours? She sacrifices her profession, as did her mother. And that's why I'm the only one who can stop her, she doesn't listen to him - Yeah, she's listening to me. - is she answering your email? - yes there she is - Oh, my God, (Paul). - (Paul)? I knew you'd be surprised, I knew it Looks like someone's trying to get over the relationship - she hates ours, doesn't she? - - What are you doing here, David? - I'm traveling to Bali, what are you doing here? - I fly to Bali I couldn't let her travel alone, so she switched the flight with another pilot The other pilot will be in charge of (Uruguay) flights next month This is what we do when we love, right? - That's very nice. - I know. Very pleasant Oh my God, his eyes You can swim in them, right? Blue eyes, I don't see what's amazing about them, my socks are blue too French men are great lovers It's a rumor they spread themselves Keep lying to yourself - Champagne. - Two glasses, please. Just leave the bottle, thanks Baby, I don't think having him on the same trip will help you. He acts only to get attention The last time David helped me was the night we had Lily. This is a mental picture I don't like to think about A person can improve himself when he learns You're supposed to fly the plane, Paul, not kiss the female passengers Only this traveler is of interest to me This is hard for you to understand. Paul makes me a priority and supports everything I do It's because everything you do is great He's exaggerating - Oh really? Are you exaggerating? - I do not exaggerate - Of course you're exaggerating - Don't say that. It's okay, it's just a bump, the plane is designed to correct itself Please, go back to your seats My house, my garden, my house, I have a lot of aquarium fish in my house And that's my dog ​​(Charlie), did I mention it's an old dog and.... Everything will be fine, madam It's okay, everything will be fine Of course things like this happen We are not magicians, we do not have complete control over the planes Of course, people understand these things You're the worst pilot I've come across so good trying to kill us you bastard Maybe you should go and rest a bit, I'll see you when you get back, okay? see you later Don't blame yourself Paul, it could happen to anyone who doesn't know what they're doing Where is Lily? I thought you got her message, you'll meet us at the boat What? This is the most amazing place I've ever seen Do you know what a really cool place is? Hawaii, it's in America. You've never been to Hawaii? - You don't know where I'm going. You've never been to Hawaii Well, let's think of a plan As much as this will hurt us, we have to make a truce between us for the plan to work - Let's get along. - No bad comments. There's no arguing. Exactly - when do we start? - As soon as you see (night) We have to cancel this wedding and bring her home You know very well that when we prevent Lily from doing something she insists on doing more So, I suggest we agree to her decision 100% and support her wholeheartedly And we'll make her in some sneaky way to end her relationship with Mr. Kelp. That's interesting, I'm thinking of a Trojan horse-like plan We'll make her think we've agreed to the wedding and then make her finish the wedding by herself This is exactly what I said I don't remember you ever mentioning anything about the Trojan horse Well, got the plan? Of course I get it, it's my plan. Thanks, we took our things Hello Hello Hello Hello Did you two agree to kill each other after killing me first? Come on, no one will get killed, I mean of course we ask a lot of questions We are your parents, and we are here for you, my dear - We're getting along. - Yeah, right. Well, I was so afraid of your reaction Especially you, Dad, because you panicked when you got my ears pierced Yes, it was about your health I know you both wanted me so much to be a lawyer We just want you to be happy, Lily. Oh my gosh, well I feel so relaxed now Well, oh my gosh. Hello, Lily. Hello, Ren. Don't worry about me, did they support you? We're getting along now, you're going to love it here and Gedeh. You'll love him? - His name is Gedeh. great name - - Very cool. - Please, stop. I can't wait to learn more about seaweed farming Are you sure you don't find a problem with it? You can just be honest with me You don't have to do a Trojan horse trick ...what...what...what...what...what is this? Didn't you tell me this story, Mom? No, it was I who told you about the Trojan horse, I was the one who told the story It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, we're just here for you Yes, we are in agreement I don't know why we didn't go to the hotel directly We were supposed to be here hours ago - It wasn't his fault. - Pilot's fault. The engagement party will start now Who will attend the party? Only close family members Well, time for a walk What? We have to go up, the bus won't be able to get that many I want a refund of the thousands of rupees I paid You know it's about a quarter of a dollar, right? Mom, dad, this is Gedeh. Welcome, father. Welcome, mother Welcome, Gedeh. You learned this phrase to make me look ignorant You'll look clueless without me looking for it Welcome to my country and my home You don't have to call me Mrs. Carlton, just call me Gorga. Got it, okay, Georgia. I don't mind you calling me Mr. Carlton. Go and have a good time. - I can pick you up, Gorga. - Yes, let's go. - Bye. - See you later. Isn't he a wonderful guy? We don't want to be late Alright, let's go. Are all of these close family members? The cool thing is that they are very connected Remember to always use your right hand and never touch anyone's head I wouldn't want to touch someone's head Hello,guys I present to you Kumang, and these are his tattoos Pleased to meet you He doesn't know we'll have breakfast tomorrow Will they marry too? (Layla) Welcome This word means: my daughter You are my daughter It's my daughter Come here, I will shake hands with you now and when they get married we will have a strong family bond that cannot be broken Yes, we will shake each other's hand like this every time Now give me your knife my knife? give me your knife - I didn't bring a knife. - You don't have a knife? - I didn't bring a knife. - You don't have a knife? No no Well no problem Oh my God It's a habit we have after parents meet each other to cut part of their body with their blood smearing I was joking, how you look... Hey guys, slap my hand It's great to see such a big family, they always have something to celebrate I want to memorize their names, I don't think I can remember all these names Yes, I tried to write their names already in a list, the names are too many You're in the kitchen, that's something new for you - Lily. - Hello. Mom, dad, this is Sully, Gedeh's mom, and this is his sister, Lucy. She's training to be a doctor. Great, hello, nice to meet you She says: Hello Kids play soccer here before going to school You can join them if you want Not my favorite sport, I don't think so So do you grow seaweed? We use the net. The seaweed is tied with fishing lines and after 5 weeks we take it out Then we freeze and ship it. Where do you ship it to? Previously, mainly (Japan) but now to all parts of the world And we recently contracted with Whole Foods stores, we are always trying to develop our business He says you are very beautiful Tell him I thank him for the compliment Now he says you remind him of a very attractive horse Oh really? This cannot be true No, did not mean: horse Mr. Carlton, I want to tell you that I love your daughter very much I don't blame you for this I appreciate that you did not object to our marriage so quickly So, I have to thank you and Georgia. Apparently, you two are a great couple And I loved Bali so much I can see her happiness here... for a while for a temporary period? Nothing lasts forever Marriage is supposed to last forever That's what I thought when I was sitting next to Gorga. And we have lawyers who organize our marriage papers So, enjoy what happens until the moment she ends all this by herself And she will, because she is ambitious and her curiosity never ends As beautiful as this island and just as cute as it looks on you In the end, none of this will be enough My advice to you is not to have children Because things will get a lot more complicated when she takes them back to America. I feel hungry, how about you? Let's get something to eat Let's get some food Today, in honor of our distinguished guests, I will speak English Why are you so greedy? They don't give out prizes to whoever finishes the whole pig Paul is very lucky, he will enjoy all your critical judgments on his own Sully and I welcome all friends and family to our home Which will soon be Lily's home Maybe not... And how proud we are? - I got Gedeh thinking about it. I saw you two talking, what happened? - Phase two begins - The stage of getting out of the Trojan horse and killing people We are not close to the second stage yet You may be sitting at another party, but the party that It seems that we will be related to 150 people You always see things from your perspective Everyone sees things from their own perspective - That explains why you left me? - I didn't leave Lily. And so we love better When getting married, you must choose the right place And choose the right time Choosing the right conditions I wish someone had explained this to us before, we did not meet all three conditions - We got it on one condition. - What? We agreed on one condition - The wrong circumstances, the wrong time. - But the right place - for your information So, I announce the marriage of Gedeh and Lily and the implementation of Edana's proposed ideas here Do you agree, my dear? She blesses marriage now and always And what about you, David and Jorga? Do you agree? Yes, we congratulate this marriage - Say: Yes. - Yes, for the time being. - Say: Always. - And always Awesome, awesome, that's good. This is so cool, so cool. Of course, things couldn't have gone any better than that What were you and my dad talking about at the beach? The seaweed industry asked a lot of questions. He loves you He loves you He loves you This is the one thing we will never agree on Oh really? I did not know. Welcome to the hotel It's a great honor for us to see your two smiling faces Your room number 221 It's a great room. Make sure I stay away from her And you, madam? Too far, please. Room 222, it's great too Are you still covered while sleeping? Did you know that people cover less when they get older? I'll hear your snoring all night long. - I think you should. - I have to run. Did you know that the way you sleep is like playing Karate? You take positions as if you are attacking the bed I wasn't sleeping, I was attacking you Here you are - Try to lower your snoring. - I have a nasal strip. I'm not surprised you haven't dated a woman yet More, please Bring me a drink just like that What are you doing here, Rin? I'm like your daughter, I'd rather stay long in a thatched hut on dirt I have a very clean and tidy room here I'm happy for you You know, I blame you for all this mess Is that how you think about it? You don't think much At least, I'm happy After seeing her struggle for four years in college, I'd love to see how she is now I thought you would like this too Happiness is a beautiful thing, and Lily's happiness is the best thing that can happen The thing is, there are weird things that happen when we have kids When they have a problem When they feel pain, this feeling kills us But when they're better... and things are going perfectly Then we are very afraid, because we do not want this situation to end You will know this feeling Do you always feel this way? Speaking of which, why don't you tell me what happened in your last marriage? The same thing happens in every relationship When the relationship started, it was a fairy feeling Then we ran into reality We used to ride bicycles in a place by a lake Lake Red E or whatever One day, I saw that this place was for sale We were much younger But I said that one day we will have to live here ...then she said She is smiling that smile Why wait? Why do we postpone the good moments to the future? Don't we deserve good things to happen to us all the time? And she was right, it doesn't happen often Then we bought the place, and started building a wonderful house in a wonderful spot So I was busy, I was working to pay our debts I was tired, and she was tired too Then we started to feel not married at all It was like feeling like we were in camp with someone we used to go out with We used to fight and quarrel a lot, we were hard on each other And I thought if I could live with her in that house and solve all our problems And everything will be fine So... One night, I got a call from the people on the other side of the lake They said they saw fire And when I got there, everything had turned to ashes Three weeks later, our relationship ended Haven't you ever tried it at home? I'm just a memory Good night, Rin. Looks like I won't be able to arrive before the wedding day I'm so sorry sweetheart, how's Lily doing? in love This is wonderful. - This is a terrible thing. I agree with you, she's making a mistake There is a ceremony where Gedeh and Lily exchange rooms and everything Will they wear rings at the wedding? There will be no wedding I will not let her waste her life on a very handsome young man who lives in the most beautiful place on earth And yes, I know what I sound like, but I'm right You are always right, my love where have you been? - We'll talk later. Bye. Tell me what's going on The happy couple will stand in a ceremony to be blessed and then the ring bearer will give them to them But if this ceremony is not completed, the idea of ​​"appropriate place, time and conditions" will fail. - So we steal the rings? - I would suggest this - But you didn't, it's my idea. - Well. The ring bearer is his cousin why me? Difficult tasks are always your specialty while I specialize in garbage disposal Get things off the high shelves Not that high and I hate flattery - Just do it. - Why? Because it was your idea - Hey guys! - Would you like a tour around the place? Can I show you something first? Let me show you something You see, I'm from (America) and there we eat bananas differently Cut it into slices before you peel it I'm not kidding Come on, I'll show you Do you see this banana? Looks normal, right? There is no cut from the outside - There's no cutting. - Well. I want you to take it, put your bag here, take it and peel it This is how we do it The rings we will exchange have been blessed with holy water I do difficult tasks Yes, yes, I can't believe they believed the banana trick I feel like you're upset because it wasn't your idea Maybe we can show you the rings Katut keeps, Katut. Here we are And now they are looking for it The bag is empty - What does he say? - I wasn't Listening. We should drink some to bless the newlyweds Yes Now, no one knows what to do cry (katout) It's okay, my dear, tell her that there is no problem There is a problem, if we don't find the rings, we can't You're right, no problem who cares about rings Did you hear this? It's okay, we can do this another day Well What are they doing? I will stretch out my arms and see The famous trick They feel disappointed - That's cool - really? - What do you mean? - I mean, our daughter looks like her dog. He died and I regret it - We approached. - Where? you will see I think he knows He does not know Well Are they here? They are here from here? dolphins It's going to get more exciting now What do you do? Fear not, Mr. Carlton. I'm not afraid - Yeah, you're afraid? - No. I'm not afraid Oh my God, this is amazing The water is wonderful - Are you sure it's not sharks? - Yes. Maybe the sharks help Dad, don't miss the chance, get into the water - No, he's a coward. - I'm not a coward. Yes, you are so cowardly I'm not a coward take on I can't believe a dolphin bit me It's a simple scratch Nothing like this has happened before - Really? - dad dad Watch out for dad - Did you feel pain? - He looked like a crazy woman smiling - - All the dolphins are smiling. - Now we know why. It wasn't a mistake (Gedeh) We know, things like this always happen - No, he said that something like this never happened. Can you apply pressure to the wound, Jorga? I'll go get some bandages What? The sentence means: Nothing is lost today. Yes, he knows try to... What's wrong? He said "Press the wound", he asked me to press it I looked around and realized that everything I wanted was right in front of me I could go back and try...one more time, but I knew that Every second I dreamed of being here Then I thought, as you always say: Why do we postpone the good moments for the future? Yes, I say this hold this Excuse me, I want to buy this stuff Are you two tourists? She's a tourist, but I live here now Let's negotiate the price No, no need to negotiate a price, just give me a fair price But I like to negotiate, Americans make great deals Price 800 thousand rupees Well No, no, say: 500,000 just say this - So 500,000? - Enough, please. You're going to kill me. - It's 700,000. - It's 600,000, or I'm leaving. so it's okay Thanks I am so grateful to you both - No need for this. - Yes. It's the most important decision I've made in my life and you've come all this way to support me You're a very nice woman Thank you I'm not really nice I don't know what this is but I love it - It's called Mortepak. - Merthback. Listen, Lily and I can buy better rings than these but you'd better get them back What are you talking about your friends? I haven't told Lily anything, and I won't, but, Mr. Carlton, I want you to stop this now, do you know what I think? I guess you didn't tell Lily anything because you were afraid she might doubt your words And if you tell her already, she might listen...to these doubts, which will lead to I didn't tell her because it would hurt her so much The only reason her parents finally got along is because they united to ruin their relationship If anyone has to be afraid here, it's you. I'm not here to steal your daughter from you, that's the last thing I want to do It's not a contest to win or lose But trust me, if Lily finds out what you're doing, you're going to lose Enjoy Marthback Were the men hiding in the Trojans the good guys? It doesn't matter good or bad, they won the war And what exactly was the war? Don't do this, George. - Do you think we are wrong? - We're not wrong. I think we're wrong Do you remember when we agreed to Is this together and we are on good terms? Yes, but that was before we saw her, I mean we see them but you know that... Great, famous trick won again What is the meaning of this? Listen, I see Lily one day a week While she was with you the whole time, she was listening to you and counting on you And you were the one who bought everything she asked for I couldn't buy her what she was asking for Yes, I was always with her to make the rules, or fight with her But you were the cheerful parent who used to take her to every Entertaining places and buy her what she wants and then take her home That's not what you wanted. - So, you shouldn't have left. I had to leave, our relationship ended because the house was on fire. It's because you didn't love me - and you weren't even attracted to me. You never respected me, and you never respected me. This is absolutely not true When you proposed to me, did you... really want to get married or did you just want to I wanted to be happy and make you happy too How happy I am now? - Cool, me too. Wonderful, wonderful - Fabulous - Cave - Cursed. - Rocky Genesis (Tanah Lot) - Hello! - What time is it? Best time! Well It doesn't look like you were asleep I do some moisturizing before bed Well, let's wake up What is happening? Welcome Welcome Well I have a mission for you guys Come on, let's go I can't believe we're here I don't think you should be here when you're hurt Sharks are attracted to blood She always listens to you I do not know What? She does this She didn't try to make me happy like she was trying to make you happy It's only… What do you mean then? I think she still looks like you I'll tell you something else Tried to make you collect as much seaweed as if it was a contest if it was... I'm not trying to win Good thing it's not a contest This is a good thing - Wait, wait. - Get away from me. Get away from me - What do you do? - That was mine. It's getting weird We thought it would work, but no Bring new rings Thank you for helping my son harvest this morning Who won? Nobody, it wasn't a contest. - There was no contest - That's exactly what they said. Maybe it was something else You are in harmony with me Federation...Federation - Absolutely! - Well. How could this be weather? In their beliefs that equalizing their teeth with a file removes them Fierce and evil so they can have a happy marriage Rather, it strips them of the ability to chew solid food, which will cause problems I know a man who wanted to marry a Jewish woman and was circumcised for this. This is worse than circumcision No, circumcision is worse Was it a painful feeling? Was it as bad as we think? It was very painful, so I came here for some anaesthesia - Come on, a set of bottles. - Thank you. - Will the experience be difficult? - I do not know - The last time I was here, I woke up by a tree with a lot of sand in my mouth It's a kind of local play Not for the faint of heart No one will be afraid of a challenge please Not bad I really don't recommend this experience This is not his first experience with rodeo I'm proud that I shared his first college experience with him You supported me so much then, you were amazing - That's cool. - I played other games. Yes, I played other games You can, come on Here you are Die... Is that all he has? Not for the faint of heart Let's play then Yes - We're going to play some rounds. - Really? - And it wouldn't be beer. - Well. - Let's get started. - That's not a good idea. It's important to start here. Well, you'll need this. No problem, I'll throw it like that - Hey, what was that? - I have to stretch my arms, I have to stretch them. - Give me another chance. - There you are. Here we go.

Mom, you are amazing, educated, strong, smart and beautiful But you're not at your best with him Yes, he's cute and has pretty eyes, but that's not enough Receiving love and giving love are two different things In addition to his love for strange surprises There is only a curtain between us and I heard all your talk I feel bad She didn't say anything, she just said "yes" How can you know this? An old friend doesn't need to be racing to congratulate his friend on his marriage He rejoices for him, but he will not race to buy a gift Since when are you two old friends?

Is it drifting with the current? No, it just goes up with the tide Floats away? - You didn't tie my boat. Yeah, I tied it tight This is not good How far are we from the nearest village? We'll go a long way - It's going dark. - There's no signal on my phone. What shall we do?

My Father - Lily. - What are you two doing here? - We were about to catch him. - I can't believe you. We don't want to scare him. That's not what I'm talking about. - What are you talking about then? - I found the rings. Oh really? That's great, where? in my mom's bag - I had my doubts about her - What? I had doubts Apparently, she didn't... do this alone because Hey, what? You left the rings in the bag? - What do you mean you knew? - What should I do? Sorry, I couldn't tell you You could have thrown the rings in the ocean or anywhere Stop This I can't believe what's happening, my parents tried to ruin my wedding My fiancé found out about it and couldn't tell me We tried to do what was in your best interest. You didn't respect my freedom to make decisions. You are typical parents You act as if you want your daughter's best interest But in fact, you are trying to escape from your past Don't repeat the mistakes you made 25 years ago It's not 100 percent true. It's not 100 percent true. You can't imagine how much I wish someone could take me back in time It prevented me from making the biggest mistake of my life Am I the biggest mistake of your life? Not you, but me I'm wrong Layla We didn't mean to bother her She is so upset I'll talk to her I'll tell her it was my idea And I convinced you Then you listened to my plan And things will be fine You weren't wrong It wasn't I've always blamed you for my life but it's not true ...I was I love to play the role of a mother ...but I'm starting to feel like... I'm losing my identity, and I thought ...that if I could continue my life with you, maybe I will never know myself anymore And that was the mistake Not you You didn't tell me about it Your father thinks you deserve a better man than me My dad thinks I deserve a better man than everyone else and me too You know you would love to continue your life on this island And you know I understand this But what about me?

I wanted to sell it to a writer at one time but I couldn't do it and what else? the whole forest no no no no - it's just... - No This won't work It's not a good idea. It's not a good idea. ...no, it's all about Lily and - Maybe, if we're younger - No, we're old - We know this. - Wow, cool. Wonderful, wonderful Wonderful...awesome, you know... - Hey, what? - Yes Yes - So, yes. - Mom, dad. Where are your parents? Hello. We have rights.

It's okay baby Is it possible that I didn't bring anything to wear to the wedding? There wasn't supposed to be a wedding Doesn't look like a rented suit You are good at cleaning Well Wow, our daughter she is beautiful And now for the last part of the ceremony. - Thank you very much. Gedeh will take the knife and hit it on the map to prove that he and Lily are ready to live together. my little one "Right place, right time" "appropriate conditions" Sorry, but the three conditions are not met George, Mr. Carlton.

We won't get married Why didn't you let me try with them first? You can also accomplish difficult tasks You don't need our blessing You already have it, and it's you You only need yourself If her mother and I had listened to her horrible parents or my stupid friends When Lily was in...life, I think we can all agree that Life just got better...with Lily, so I... We support you and your mother Then, now, and always let's go? wait I'm just kidding, keep it up Do you think if we kicked that coconut at our wedding Would our lives have been better? I'm sure if we cut a red and white ribbon we wouldn't lose anything Paul proposes to me I know Propose to me as a second attempt this morning What was your response? I asked him for some ice because he accidentally hit my nose Both sides are supposed to kiss at a moment like this Let me see your nose Let me see I think you should accept his offer Well Paul is a good man If he could make you half the happiness we were together Then you have to agree I do not know I may have gotten so old that I don't feel so young anymore I think I missed something important but it's too late In fact... You look so young in my opinion Do you want that crooked nose? Welcome what are you doing here? Look at this ugly sight Do you call this sunset?

We can do something other than paddling with the waves if you want to - Did I do something wrong? - No. No, it's just the wrong time. 'Wrong place' The wrong woman I am very sorry and me too I think I agree with you But I'll go kayaking with the waves though Where is Paul? He had some time to talk before he left He asked me to inform you of his peace I told him that the relationship between me and him wouldn't work out between me This is his opinion too my mother...
