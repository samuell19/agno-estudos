Son, have some tea before you go. I don't want it. I am leaving. Okay then, give it to Mangal. Take this. Are you doing well? There he comes early in the morning. Nikka, don't give the tea to Mangal. I already have... Take it back and pour it in the tumbler. Give it back. - I... You can go and drink some in the fields. The enemy is about to bark. Give this one some tea too! It has been so long since you have been watering this tree. No new sapling has grown yet. It's alright. It is my dad's memory. It will become green. Well then, this tea looks strong. Go on drink it. Is it tasty? Damn, they gave me cold tea. They gave me cold tea too. That is why I tell you to keep them under control. Mine has left this world, but there wasn't a day that lucky one gave me cold tea. Mhindo. - Yes? Tell me. Your forehead is exactly like the bumper of our vehicle. Your eyes shine like headlights too. Stop it. Whenever I'm away from you and I miss you I pull over the truck and sit in front of the bumper. I swear I only see you. Come on, you are just bluffing. You really look like my 3612. Doctor, wake up. My brother, we are late. I don't want to go to school today. Get up, brother. Don't behave like this. Get up. Get up, please. - I don't want to go. Let's go. - I won't go. Dad! Mom! Aunt, I will make your son a doctor! Help me! Save me! Nikka, why do you want him to be beaten by teachers? In another two years he will work as a cleaner on my truck. Nikka, should I give you paranthas with tea? No, Aunt, I am full. Eat something. That old woman must have sent you away without feeding you. And my younger sister Shanti, makes very delicious paranthas. You will eat her fingers. I mean it. I know how well she cooks. Nikka, you take him to such a far off school unnecessarily. You can try as hard as you want, this tube will burst before he is in tenth standard. No, Uncle. That school has better education than our village. Uncle, he will become a doctor. Watch, he will be very useful to us. "Let's go to Barnala, beautiful one." Where do you want to go? Where do you want to go? "My tube well has such cool water." "My father will be very angry." Are you going to Fatehgarh? Sat Sri Akal. - Sat Sri Akal. How is it going? Is he studying well? He is very intelligent. Go and sit down. You came early today? Yes, brother dropped me on his way to the market. We have many expectations from him. Yes, of course. Stay back. We'll go together. Why do you want to get me into trouble? Yes, he writes well too. Where is my stuff? I gave it to the Doctor. Alright then. Okay, thank you. - Sat Sri Akal. Who brought this bottle of milk? Someone make some tea. Ms Saawan. Will you have some tea? With cardamom. - No, head teacher. Your wish. Doctor. - Yes? Come here. Yes. - Where is my stuff? First make Charno sit with me. Have some shame. You don't feel any shame. Why do you behave like this? Please, make Charno sit with me. Please, sister-in-law. Charno. - Yes? Why are you talking so much? Go and sit with the Doctor. Okay, mam. Off you go now. Good boy. Gore, I will play too. Come quickly then. Take this bag at least. What will I do with this bag? You take it. And write on the slate too. I want you to become a doctor and you just don't understand. I know everything. You will make me a DC. Let me go. What should I write on it? Nikka, you should ask your girlfriend. Sardar, my day goes by when I meet you. But I have to get through the night too. You should write something loving in the letter at least. Have some shame. Should I be embarrassed in front of you, Sardar, then what will I do in front of the world? At least write something nice about me. Okay, listen then. This whole world is pale when compared to you. God didn't make any other girl like you in this world. No girl in this world can match up to you. Brother, I... Ever since I saw you, Brother... I don't feel like looking at anyone else. Nikka, it's me. Gura baba's son is walking the wrong path. Save your life, Mangal. Brother, it is me, Mangal. Your employee. What happened? The tractor won't start. Brother, I won't do this. What are you doing? Let it be parked there. I will make do with the bullocks. Oh, my God. It's you? Will you stay at our house tonight? No... Saawan... do you know our cotton crop has... no, it has a pest problem. And today our tube well... Why do you keep writing about buffaloes and fields? I have started knowing them better than I know you. I know. Your older buffalo gave birth to a calf. And your crop didn't do well this year either. You should write something about us too. These matters shouldn't be discussed before marriage. I don't know if we'll get married or not. Then you will say that I deceived you. You may still have doubts. I am absolutely certain. If I get married, it will be with you. Otherwise, I will jump into a well. Hey, girl! Saawan! I am coming, mom. These hearts that you keep making are wrong. Do you know that? Sardar, do you want me to make you my brother and tie a rakhi? Do you know, my heart wants that I should put my head in your lap and sleep. You've started writing very enticing things nowadays, haven't you? I don't know. I didn't ask you to feed me the meat from your thigh. You can't even do this much for me? Go away. Come here. Sardar, let me go. What kind of hobbies are you getting into? Sit with me. Mangal Singh, just get through this year somehow. Lie down on my thigh now. - I won't work for them next year. Let me go, Sardar. Find another man. Sardar, what are you looking for? "I asked you what are you looking for in your pocket?" "I am looking for a necklace for you." "What are you looking for in your pocket?" "I am looking for a necklace for you." "What am I going to do with a necklace?" "It is important to have a token of love." "What am I going to do with a necklace?" "It is important to have a token of love."

"What am I going to do with a necklace?" "It is important to have a token of love." This girl is all grown up now. She has started acting like an adolescent too. Find a suitable match for her. Mom, you can see the girl has grown up. You can't see that I am adult too. I am older than her. First, get me married. Shall I find a girl for you from my pocket? It is only possible if your dad talks to some people about it. I don't know. If I run away with someone tomorrow, then don't blame me. I have the desire too that someone should snatch this tobacco box from me and throw it in the fire. Have some shame, fool. I have crossed twenty eight while having shame. And look at this guy sitting here. People's grandad's make a hundred excuses that I am about to die. I want to see my grandson get married. Make some noise. Don't you feel like seeing my wedding? His ears are gone. He can't hear the music of my wedding. Show him old women dancing at least. Pirthi from Bhagsar had come. He suggested a match for you. You and Saawan should go and see the girl. They are ready for marriage. If you see it fit, then give the girl one rupee and do the rituals. Hey, there it is! Over there, you fool. You must take out the Neem. Tomorrow I am going with my mom to see a girl for my brother's wedding. Where are you getting my brother-in-law married? Udaykaran. Swear by me. I swear. Why will I lie? Then it is settled. My grandmom's maternal house is there. Do you swear? - I swear. If your brother gets married there, we will make his in-laws the mediators for our marriage. Who are they? Do you know their names? There is a Sukhdev Patwari. She is his daughter. Roop? We are very close to them. She is very beautiful too. Do you find her beautiful? It's not like that. She sued to play with me when we were children. She once hit me with a small rock and gave me a big wound. And when your wedding procession comes, I will impress your family so much. Your family will feel that they won't find a better match than me for their Saawan. Is that so? Here, I made a roti for you. I have made it for the very first time. I want you to eat it. Let it go. Will you be able to eat such rotis, Sardar? I will eat them. Don't tell her. You have an off tomorrow. Play your favourite games. Grandad, I will play too. Do one thing, forget playing. Take this and count it. Count it. Grandmom, he didn't go? He did. He came back barking in time for the afternoon tea. Neither his sons tolerate him nor his daughters-in-law bother about him. This enemy has imposed him upon us. He was bad enough and he found friends just like himself. I feel he will make me poison the tea some day. Grandmom, I thought I will visit my maternal house. What will you go there for? They never visit us themselves. My in-laws are so arrogant, they've never bothered to come here even on special occasions. Nikka, forget it. Go to the fields. Just keep sitting there. Your family has done great wonders. The boy will go. You must go, son. Come, let him bark. What are you doing? Get lost from here! Get lost right now! Grandmom, grandad won't let me play. Here you go. I will beat yours this time. You can't even beat your own. What kind of a life do you have? Listen to me, keep her under your thumb. Come on, get down. "Hey, merchant. I am yours, you are mine." "Don't ever leave me." "The love that we started in our childhood," Merchant... - Sat Sri Akal. Bravo! How did you think of visiting today all of a sudden, Nikka? Uncle, your letters are of no use. Why? Buta Uncle's sister-in-law is getting married on the fifteenth. What? - Yes. What happened? You look stressed now. I will be stressed, silly. I feel I may be the only one left alone. Don't tease you Uncle, I am telling you. Buta's mother-in-law, has given her birth just for me. Take this. - Here is your tea, brother. Here you go, Uncle. How many times have I told you not to call me that? Go away. Uncle, - Yes? I want us to go to Sukhdev Patwari's house. Sukhdev Patwari's house? We are not in talking terms with them. Why? - Here is the story. Once their goats ate all our mustard. I went to ask them for a bullock and they refused. Once dad was unwell, I went to ask for eggs, he said that our their hen doesn't lay any eggs. Someone should ask him, that if their hen doesn't lay eggs then does the buffalo? Because of this behaviour, we have shunned them. Then do it for the sake of Uncle Buta's sister-in-law. He said that he is not in talking terms with you all. But for me my grandmom's entire maternal village is dear. I insisted that we must visit you. This is your dad's maternal family. But they are the worst in the entire village. Roop's grandad was trying to get Saudagar married in such a great family. His mother and he didn't agree. And look at him barking around now. His sisters-in-law don't let him get settled either. Have you found a princess now? Why is this silly girl scrubbing her heels today? Son, the boy's family is coming to see her today. You're that excited? There is no use scrubbing your heels. Have you forgotten the rock? I have a big one in my hand right now. You mother-in-law won't let you wear slippers. She is going to keep you on a tight leash. Never mind. At least I will have a mother-in-law whether she is good or bad. No one's going to give you their daughter. Really? Is that so? Then grandmom, you will be the mediator for me. And then I will get married into her in-law's family too. I will find her sister-in-law and get married to her. As if your face is that handsome. Definitely, son. Why not? Sukhchain! - Yes, grandmom? Go and get the old woman. - I am going. I think the bus is about to come. No, grandmom, I'll go get them. - Oh, wait. Sit down, son. There are so many of them around. They will go and get them. Sit down. Go. - Grandmom... It's alright. This is my own work. And I will tell her mother-in-law how spoilt her daughter-in-law is. Let's go, Uncle. - Let's go. Why are you barking around here? Why are we here? We are acting like Patwari's assistants. Uncle, have patience. I will tell you the reason. You will be very happy to hear it. What is going on? Come. Sat Sri Akal. Sat Sri Akal. Sat Sri Akal. - Sat Sri Akal. Give me your blessings. We are here on Sukhdev Patwari's behalf. So, Aunt, which village are you from? From Gulabewaala. - Alright. How are you related to the girl? I am the girl's brother. I am from the same village. We are quite close to them. Tell me, is Uncle fine? Everything is fine. Which village are you married into? I am still looking. What are you looking for at this old age? Say directly that you are single. No, I am quite fit physically. Age is nothing but a number. It seems by the looks of you that you will be gone a couple of years. Hurry up and come forward, girl. I am here, mom. - What kind of a woman is she? Roop, wake up. They are here. Who all have come? - One fat woman, and a girl. Now hurry up. Sat Sri Akal. - Sat Sri Akal. What is your name? - Roop. Didn't you wear an anklet? - No. Do you know how to sing? "The needle is small, the thread is thick." "I sit and embroider it." "The travellers passing by ask me," "why are you crying, girl?" "My father got me married." "I am going to be a stranger now." "My father got me married." Who is this Sukhchain? Girl, he is Roop's brother. Look, she embroidered this pillow herself. Come, sit. And she embroidered her sister-in-law's name on the other side. This is the girl. Her complexion is average. But she looks presentable. Look at me. Look up. She looks alright too. We approve. We like the girl. I have found my sister-in-law to be very beautiful. Here, take this. Wear this Kohl in your eyes. Congratulations, Aunt! Congratulations to you too. Many congratulations. You are after all the fortunate mother of the groom. Be careful. Don't poke her eye out. Hold from that side. Here, hold it. Take this. My daughter. "There were two beautiful girls in a village." "The younger one created an upheaval." Look, how God suddenly made all the arrangements. Did it seem possible this morning? Brother, sister-in-law is very pretty. What happened, mom? She doesn't even answer. Let me have some water at least. I feel there is a draught here and you're asking for water. Here, hog this. Drink the water and tell me quickly what happened. Stop having this tobacco now. Here you go, I have quit it right now. I will start eating opium after marriage. Jatti will make a tiny ball of opium for me. It will be so enjoyable. I will be doubly intoxicated. Silly boy. We have fixed you wedding for the coming autumn. What is this? You have acted like a nonsense woman! I don't know anything. Get me married at the earliest! Let the monsoon season pass. Let the monsoon pass. Then she will keep travelling the entire month. This boy has become absolutely shameless. It's alright. I will go with her too. We will both stay away from you. She is babbling on. Brother, her family will need to make arrangements for the wedding too. Exactly. Eat this laddoo. You are concerned about your sister-in-law. You are not worried about our grandad. Hey, grandad! Say something. Don't you want to see me get married? I don't know. Either get me married quickly, or get me injected with poison. Here you go. Have some shame! This behaviour will not be tolerated here! She thinks too much of herself. Come along then, come along this time. I will have to come. Only then we can have fun. Here you go. Take this. You fixed the marriage date quite suddenly. Yes. You know how the boy's family is. They said the grandad is sick. - Alright. We will send Nikka then. I won't be able to go. My buffalo is sick. You will come, won't you? I will... - He won't come either. Why? - He is busy. Mom, you say such embarrassing things. And you didn't give me tea either. Go home and have your tea. If he drinks my tea, his wife will make a fuss. We have separated him because of this very problem. Won't you go either? Which fool is asking me to go anyway? If you keep sister-in-law on a tight leash, as elders say, their knots are tied way back to their maternal homes. It will be effective then. But no, you don't have the courage. Why are you wasting water? This tree won't become green. Here, drink this. You drink it too. - Give me. Sister-in-law, Uncle's memory will become fresh. Yes, your Uncle was a fish, that this water will refresh his memory. Where are you going? - To our house. We'll take your leave, Aunt. Bye. Listen, you are taking this bachelor with you. Your wife is so gullible. Why are you inviting trouble? Mom, you start making jokes. This idiot is so useless. Don't I know my maternal family? They snatch a buffalo if they visit their sister's home. He is talking about his wife. Will you start the discussion about my marriage then? I will see what happens. Here, have some tea. - Here you go. Give me your blessings, sister-in-law. So sister-in-law, are Uncle and Aunt okay? They are fine. And how is your younger sister? Shanti? Fortunately, she must be at a marriageable age now. What about my tea? Come inside. I'll give you. I'll be back. - Alright. Doctor! - Yes? Come here. Come on, hurry up. Look my son, I request you, don't call me Uncle. It gives me a stomachache. I will call you Uncle. Where is the tea, sweetheart? - You're asking for tea, fool. You have brought this scoundrel home. The chassis is old, the engine is in running condition. Listen to me carefully, I will get my sister married to Nikka. Do you understand? Uncle, Uncle. - You're calling me Uncle again. What is this Uncle, Uncle? He is your paternal Uncle. And if you want to call him maternal uncle, then call Nikka that. Do you understand? Go inside. - Maternal Uncle. Congratulations. - May God multiply everyone's brood. Here. - Okay then. Give me your blessings, grandmom. You are here, Nikka? - Yes. Why didn't sister come? How can old women leave all there work and come, Aunt? Go and get some tea. - No, grandmom. Why are you being formal? We didn't come here to drink tea. The girl is getting married. We are supposed to help around. What are you doing now? Put it down and spread the bedding on it. Work quickly. Now pick it up. My sister's grandson's is very helpful. Why are you standing around like this? The girl is getting married. Go and do some work. Who knows God may have mercy on your destiny too? Go, get lost. Just get lost. Sister, my dupatta doesn't match this colour. Really? Show me. Mom. - Yes? What is this? Wear some other dress. Who is going to look at you anyway? This is a special day for this daughter of mine. Come, son, let's work. - I don't want to. I don't want to. Do one thing... Here you go. Finish eating food quickly. We have the entire night to do all this. Oh, my God. Look at the bride. I am not a bride yet. It's almost time. Our brother must be absolutely ready. Look at you, feeling all shy. Have your food, silly. Who knows if your in-laws will feed you or not? "Your lover is coming home." "Your lover is coming home." "Don't go too far to play, your lover is coming home." This boy is so clever. Look at him with all those women. There are a hundred members in this family. This boy has mesmerised them all. He is too sharp. Here you go, Uncle. - Come, come. Here, pour me some. Pour it quickly. - It's English. You should sing too. Nikka, we have to go for the rituals tomorrow. -ready. - Alright, grandmom. We will go. Sit down for some time. Sing that song... The green ones... Oh, that one. I will sing it. Here you go. Now listen carefully. Let's all sing. "Oh, green one, sweet one..." "We have found a beautiful groom for you." The house looks decent. They look like sociable people. Right? - That is true. Be careful. - Take this. Hold this. - Give it to me. Take this, Uncle. Take this. They are all accounted for. Yes, I checked while keeping them. Alright, alright. Let's go. - Hurry up. Let's go. Do you have the other stuff? Sat Sri Akal. - Sat Sri Akal. We are so fortunate that you came here. Come along. Please, come. - Please, sit. Put this there. Let me keep this there. Give the guests some water. Alright. Here they come. Come. Sat Sri Akal. Sat Sri Akal. - Sat Sri Akal. Please, sit. So boys, the family is fine. Don't you think the boy's eyes are red? Like he is on some drugs? No, there is nothing like that. He used to play Kabaddi with us. And believe me, this boy is very sober. His eyes must be tired. And in our village, everyone's eyes are red. Really? Maybe. - Yes. Alright, Sarpanch. Say Waheguru and start the ceremony. Let's go. Come, Nikka. Someone hold this plate. There you go, Tiger. Have some sweets. He is eating it. Sister-n-law, who is this boy? His grandmom is from this village. They are quite close with Chamkaur's in-laws. He is quite handsome and presentable too. If you can fix a match with the in-law, there's nothing like that. Sister-in-law, talk about Saawan's marriage. Their turbans suggest that they are from a rich family. You didn't give me anything, misers. At least, ask for yourself. Any Tom, Dick and Harry gets a cycle these days. Demand a motorcycle. Actually, he is naive like a pigeon. He is agreeing to everything that the mediator is saying. Is it easy to give birth to sons? A motorcycle sounds appropriate. Go ahead and say it. Alright then. The food is nice. Have some sweets too. Come, Uncle. Brother, I wanted to talk to you about something. Yes, carry on. - Tell me. They need a motorcycle before the wedding tomorrow. It seems appropriate for the land that my relatives own. Now... - It will be done. We will give it. But how? It's alright. Daughters don't take things everyday. God gives them what their destiny holds. And it's hard to find decent boys these days. Look at him, he is tall like a giraffe. Listen, the new generation thinks differently. That boy is right. Alright? It's fine. Say yes. Alright. If that makes you happy. - Okay. Here, stitch this suit with that dupatta. Move aside. They were going to get run over. Take out all the stuff. Nikka. Nikka. May I ask you something? Don't tell anyone. I won't. Go on, ask me. Swear on me. Tell me honestly, how is my would-be husband? How should I describe him? I can't think of anything. What's that called... Iron griddle, he is exactly like an iron griddle. Really? No, no. He is handsome. His eyes are beautiful too. And he used to play kabaddi with me. Nonsense! You scared me. Look how fast my heart is beating. He is fine. He has a sharp moustache. Alright, I am leaving now. May I ask something else? - What? Don't tell anyone? - I won't. You are a boy. You must be knowing... On the first night, do I have to drink from the same glass as him? Yes, he'll take one sip. Then you'll take a sip, then he'll take another one. I don't drink anyone's leftover. I will puke. Do one thing, you drink first, he can drink after you. Yes, that's fine. But what if he doesn't agree? Look, your henna is so dark. He must really be in love with you. Alright, I am going now. When the henna is dark, the mother-in-law is loving. It is a myth about the mother-in-law. The reality is the husband loves his wife if the henna is dark. By the way, grandmom, why do they apply henna? It is a tradition and is followed with pure joy. Then who can be more happy than me about the wedding? I will apply henna on my hands too. Sister-in-law, apply henna on my hands too. "Brother, apply this traditionally henna on your hands." I am going for some work now. - Mom! Yes, son? - Listen, mom. Yes? Come here. - I am coming. Tell me, what is it? - I have henna on my hands. Just rub some tobacco for me. You damn fool! Don't make me break your face on your wedding day. Stupid boy. Put some music. The women are just screaming unnecessarily. Whether there is a death or a wedding, they sing in the same tone. They can't differentiate between joy and grief. The people should come to know that Chamkaur Singh is getting married. Otherwise, after hearing their wailing, half the village will think that our grandad is dead. "Light like the feathers of a dove." "Jatt found a Jatti like a kite." "Burning red like your turban."

I have just put the milk on the stove. The old man is sitting there. Give it to him. Keep this in grandmom's room. Alright, I will. This is the milk bucket. Keep it carefully. Who is this for? - Mom, this for Roop's dowry. Today, the groom's Uncle said they want a motorcycle before the wedding ceremony tomorrow. Let's go. Let's bring it down. Jeet, help us. Look at this. How did this happen? Do you have even a little sense or not? They have demanded a motorcycle out of the blue. Fools, you didn't ask or tell anyone. And just bought it? Tomorrow, they will ask for a plane. Will you give that too? Sarpanch, you are a wise man. They are such cheap people. - Let it go, mom. Now since we have bought it, we'll give it. How does it matter? It is not about material things, Sewak. It is about one's word. What if they hurt our daughter tomorrow? Mom, I won't let my daughter marry into such a family. Woman, have you gone mad? People are dancing outside. All the wedding guests are here. The wedding procession will be here in the morning. Mom, if Roop's wedding gets cancelled at such a juncture, people will find flaws in Roop. Then who will marry Roop? What is going on? The entire family is cooped up inside. Are we dancers? Come outside, Aunt, let's all dance together. Come, Aunt, what are you thinking? We will get Roop married to his nephew. With Nikka. - With Nikka? With Nikka? - What? Look, Saudagar, we won't get our daughter married into that family. We will get Roop married to Nikka tomorrow. I don't know what you're saying. I can't understand anything. Who asks an Uncle like me? Aunt, we will have to ask his grandmom. Well, the village is so near. We'll reach there in a minute. Let's talk to sister. Come on, son. Take the tractor out. Come on, I'll go with you too. Let's go. Alright. - Let's go. You have come here in the middle of the night. IS this how marriages are planned? You are just exaggerating. Wait. They are not here to shoot you. Do you think it is their hobby to roam around in the night? What is the use if we don't help our relatives when they are in need? I know. You want to take the side of your relatives. But I have to get my grandson married. I have promised in front of the entire village, where I will get him married. My relatives are dying and you are worried about all this nonsense. He is my only grandson. And I will ask for dowry as per my wish. The entire problem is about dowry. One shouldn't be so attached to material things and money. God will make you a black cobra in your next life. Then you can crawl around the streets. Listen to me, I have told you once, the girl from your village cannot come into my family. This one has already troubled us enough. Listen, son, whether you agree or don't, since I am here now, I will fix the marriage and go. I won't give my girl to those evil people. Things would have been different if the kid's father was alive. He had a peacock tattooed on his thigh. He would have shot them in the head. He was the one who would have taught them a lesson. They are still kids. Really? All these old fellows are kids? They are still kids? - Look, Gurditt Singh, my girl will be related to my sister. What objection do you have? My granddaughter is extremely well-mannered. A man has dreams... - Enough of that now! Go on then. Do whatever you wish to do. He is not here. He is dead. If my father was alive today, I would have struck him in the head and killed him. Could he only find her for me? To marry me? Uncle, is hot-tempered. Sister-in-law, he'll be fine. Go and make the wedding preparations. Let's go, boys. Saudagar, don't tell Nikka about the wedding. I will tell him myself when he comes home. Alright. Listen, Buta! Listen, Buta! - Yes? Mom, did a snake enter the house? - No. Listen, wake your wife up as well. We have to go for Nikka's wedding early in the morning. Nikka's wedding? Nikka has gone to Uncle's house. Don't act too smart. Hurry up. I have to go to the entire village now. Your father is lying like a dead man. I will have to go and tell the entire village. Pick up your cycle and go get the guests from the girl's family. Hurry up. Go, my Tiger. Alright, mom. Idiot, get your cycle. Alright mom my foot. Nikka's wedding? Mhindo. - What? Actually... - This old hag is making such noise. Actually, mom came to say that... we have to go for Nikka's wedding in the morning. What? Wake Doctor up. Get up, it's your brother's wedding. Nikka's wedding? What will become of my sister? I know, this is all that old hag's doing. She purposely came to inform us now. Listen to me. Doctor and I will not go. Mom, I will go. I have to accompany the groom in his rituals. Shall I make you accompany him? Shut up and lie down. If I pick up the slippers, You will get so many beatings, you won't be able to count them. I don't know, I must go. - I know what this old hag is up to. She is barking around inviting people for the wedding in the middle of the night. I won't be my father's daughter if I enter that wedding. Come on, son, go to sleep now. Here they come. Mom, what did they say? Yes, Uncle, what did they say? Did it work out? - Where are you sleeping? Really? - Alright. Here he is. Uncle, come here. He is sleeping here. Nikka, Nikka. Wake up. - Nikka? Nikka, wake up. Let's go. - What happened, Uncle? Get up then I'll tell you. Not there, your slippers are this side. What happened, Uncle. - Wait, I will tell you. Come. We'll tell you. Aunt, Aunt. The Uncle that you were going to marry has been replaced. What? - Now you will marry Nikka. Go on, boy. Go to sleep. Girls, wake up. Let's go outside. You too. Go outside. They woke us in the middle of the night. Daughter, everything has been sorted. Don't worry now. It so happened that my mind worked on time. Otherwise, those scoundrels were pushing you into a well. You sued to play with him. You know him really well. This is even better for you. You are going to marry Nikka now. Hey, Major. - Come, Uncle. Look, this old man said that we must play Sadiq at Nikka's wedding. Now look what they are playing. Doctor came to tell us. I thought he was joking. It's so strange. Dad, I am coming too. Wait a minute. Let me find out first, whether they are joking or serious. Go and get your hair fixed from your mom. Uncle, let's go and find out what they are up to. Naajar Singh. - Yes? No one invites in such a manner for even a funeral, they way they have invited us for the wedding. I swear, these people are absolutely crazy. You know that the old woman dominates her husband and the entire family. This is definitely the old woman's decision too. Why are you pushing so much? Your intestines will come out. Someone needs to ask them, how will the six o'clock vehicle come at three? I am exhausted of trying too. Who is that? Uncle, tell me what happened? I will tell you. Is grandad alright or did he get a fit or something? Nothing happened to anyone. - Is grandmom alright? Yes, she is fine too. You brought me from there. At least tell me what's going on? Get down. Our Grandad is dead! Grandad! - Get lost! Look at what these fools are doing! I won't die so easily. Scoundrels. Come, my child. - What happened, grandmom? Nothing. Come, I'll tell you. Sit down, son. - What is going on? It's your wedding. - What? Sit down. Sit down. Look here. Apply it properly. - Here too. Apply it properly on this side too. Saudagar! - Yes, Aunt. Get the boy cleaned up and bathe him. I am coming, Aunt. It's alright. - What is all this? Don't you know? I think they found out about your misdeeds. That is why they are doing this. Buta, where is your wife? Mom, she said she won't come. She said her family wasn't invited and no one told her anything. What the hell were we supposed to tell her? You know that we woke up the sleeping boy in front of you. Run quickly and go and get your wedding suit. And bring the accessories too. And get the garland which is hung there too. Go now. Get up, enemy. Get dressed. The whole village has arrived. Why are you embarrassing us? I won't go. - That's fine. Listen to me, don't talk to me now. You are acting like such a boss. Now do what you want! You never listen to anyone! I am like a dog who keeps barking in this house! Aunt, we don't have the small bowls. Saudagar, start the ritual now. What is all this? No clothes, no boots. I don't have anything... Son, this is a good deed. How does a year here and there matter? Look at this. You already have henna on your hands. God makes all the ways. Your Uncle has gone to get your wedding attire for you. Saudagar, pick up the boy and jump on the bowls. She has pushed him into the well. Get down, everyone! What happened to the groom? His face is so sad. Pick up your feet now. Come on. Walk. Let's go. Stand here. The boy is wearing slippers. How will the girls steal his shoes? Jeeta! Bring some shoes for the groom. Hurry up and go. Well... Uncle, give them some money... You are nearby, you should give them. Forget it, Uncle, you are acting like a miser. Here we go. It will all work out now. Here. - Uncle, careful with the money. Give this money to the girls. It's done. Now put the sweets in his mouth. Eat it, brother-in-law. - Eat it. Yes, are you happy now, girls? So, isn't this great. Let's go inside. Stop all this. Have you come for your dad's wedding? Damn scoundrels. What did you need a motorcycle fir? The kind of house of you live in, no one would give you even a tube of a bicycle. You were looking for a motorcycle. Fools made me lose such a beautiful girl. Should we leave then, sir? - No, sit here. I will make a house for you. Dad, I want sweets. I will feed you candies right now. Listen to me, if anyone touches the sweets, I will break every single leg of yours. I will throw all the sweets into the garbage. You still haven't left? Let me take off my shoe. I will destroy your instruments. Give us your blessings. - May God bless you. Stay young. Come. Come, daughter. Get up and eat something, everyone. Kids, be careful. You may hurt yourself. Well, Gure, the bride has made her ceremonial visit too. This woman has swallowed the happiness of your family. My dad sued to tell me that a woman is like a shoe. If you don't fix her, she will bite your feet. I don't think Nikka is happy either. How can he be happy, Uncle? No one even bothered to ask him if he wanted to marry a girl. Fool, was he going to marry a boy? What should I tell you now? In a few days, your honour will turn to dust in front of the entire village. What are you barking about? - Let him be. I was saying that these women have no sense at all. They are like sheep. If they had sense, would they behave like this? Naajar, what should I tell you? I couldn't handle one and now there are two of them. They have become one now. I cried so much. No one listened to me. They did what they wanted. Here, eat this food. - I don't want it. What are you being stubborn? Your intestines will dry up. You won't lose anything. I will become a widow. I said I won't eat it. - Don't eat! Manga, eat your food and feed the rest to the dogs. Alright, grandmom. - They must be hungry. She is more concerned about the dogs. It's been three days since you've been starving. No one asked you to eat. Brother Gure, do one thing, hang yourself. I... Sister-in-law said it is customary. Nikka? - Yes? Sister-in-law asked me to be shy. If I am not shy you may misunderstand me. But I don't feel shy in front of you. It's alright. Here, you can drink it first. I can drink the leftovers. Please, don't misunderstand me. I said all that to you before wedding. I can swear on anyone, I had no relation with any boy. Alright. Oh, I finished all of it. It's alright. Wipe off your moustache. Shall we sleep? Sister-in-law said not to sleep like this. How else should we sleep? No one told me anything. I am feeling shy. Tell me in my ear. You lie down first. Sister-in-law said we should sleep like this. I am not too heavy, am I? No, it's fine. Your heart is beating even faster than me. My neck will start cramping like this. May I put my head on your arm? Please, don't misunderstand me, alright? Sister-in-law said it that's why. Otherwise, I was going to sleep on a separate bed. They didn't intend to let the marriage take place. I got blamed for nothing. They must have found out about his drug addictions. Uncle, don't make me hit you. Leave from here. You made a mistake and now you're acting smart. Take Aunt with you. And leave. What happened, son? He is abusing my dad. Should I applaud your dad? Has he won a war? Aunt, leave. Take this fool with you. Otherwise, I'll beat the whole family right here. Have some shame. Respect your elders. You have some shame and fix my marriage now. Neither I can get married nor Saawan. We will all be stuck here. Enough now. It's been three days since you've eaten. Just eat something. - I won't eat it. I will eat from my bride's hand now. Idiot, do you want me to dress as a bride now? Do what you want! Go to hell. Don't eat if you don't want to. Alright, mom. I am leaving. Bye, Aunt. What did she give you? - One rupee, grandmom. I gave her daughter-in-law five rupees. She will talk as if she is very rich. Nikka has taken Doctor to school again today. The boy is adamant about making Balkaran a doctor. He will be right back. It's alright, mom. He needs to work. Roop, his mom died as soon as he was born. My son died a year later. I raised him like my own son. Now he is yours. Keep my son happy. Yes, grandmom, I promise. Sat Sri Akal. Sat Sri Akal. Didn't you write your slate? There was a wedding in our house. Go and sit there. He went with me too. I kept waiting. I don't know what happened to them. Damn him. Dam fool, I hope he rots. The one who went to marry that girl. What is that poor guy's fault? It is possible he was helpless. What helplessness? And Saawan, I can't come every day now. Doctor. Get up. Go and stand there. Me? - Yes, get up. Don't come. I will fail your brother. And also the head teacher asks me to tea everyday. I will get tired and say yes one day. Head teacher, please, arrange some tea today. Pick up the pot and put some tea in the milk. I will come. Brother, you will be punished. Forget about punishments... tell me how many sweets do you need to stay quiet? Does anyone ask me my opinion? I have made these houses, land and given it to them. Now they act like my father. This boy doesn't listen to me at all. The entire world does the same for children. You didn't do anything extraordinary. Did you make all this alone? Didn't I toil with you? What have you done? If not more, I have reaped four trolleys of wheat. And you say I have done nothing. Those scoundrels got me married to the craziest one of them all. - Keep quiet. There is a new bride at home. - Did I bring her? Settle down. What happened to him? - What will happen? First, he was brooding for five days, now he is sulking unnecessarily. Yes, Nikka, in the monsoon, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law cannot stay together. That is why they will come to get Roop tomorrow. Her brother will come too. It's alright, grandmom. You can send her. How did you become so patient? Boys threaten to strangle themselves instead of sending their wives. Let her go, grandmom. She has to stay her all her life after that. Let her spend a few days there. And it is difficult to leave one's own home and stay at someone else's. Tell me, girl. Today is the last day of the Teej festival. What should I tell you? You are felling shy as if we don't know anything. You came running when I got married. What should I tell you? You know everything. Tell us properly. There is nothing like that. We are merely talking yet. We are getting to know one another. Liar, boys are crazy. Do you think we are stupid? I think she already had something going on. Yes, everything else must be an excuse. Who knows what good deeds she has done during her last birth? I had my eyes on him. Beware, don't eye him now. God has given him to me. He is mine now. Here. Make it sweet. - What? I mean make the roti sweet. You eat first. Shameless! Go and bring Roop back. He is acting so crazy. I have never fed the enemy with my hands. He wants me to feed him. Alright, stay blessed, my daughter. Why are you crying, daughter? That is not a stranger's house. God gives such happiness rarely to people. And get a divorce if you don't get along. What's the big deal? Your damn fool! Nonsense fellow. He is as tall as a camel and still has no manners. And he's looking for a bride. Go, my daughter. Stay blessed. Goodbye, son. Goodbye. - Go carefully. It didn't hit me. This girl is decent for tolerating him. I thought she will return with a panchayat. I made this roti for you. I made it for the first time. I want you to eat it. Will you be able to eat such rotis, Sardar? So? Have you made such a round roti till now? You just know how to do makeup. Your make up never smudges. You only came here to judge what kind of a bride I got from my maternal house. Should I eat now or leave? Why do you joke like that, mom? Why did you tease here? Let her eat. Eat this. I will slap you. You talk such nonsense. Don't you dare act like this in my house. Go and do all this in your own house. Are her hands broken? Cant she eat? That is why I don't come here. She behaves like this. What is all this, darling? You have just spent a month at your house. When I got married, I didn't cry at all. It's another story that when this enemy unveiled me, I started wailing when I saw his face. I killed my feelings and with great difficulty had these two silly children. I wasn't missing that, Grandmom. But when I saw you arguing I started missing home. My grandmom too always behaves like this with my Aunt. May I say something, grandmom? - Yes. Don't fight with Aunt. The poor thing got married and came into someone else's home. They didn't adopt me either. I married into someone else's home too. Look, you look so pretty when you smile, right? Give us some food. Roop. - Yes. Give them food. I don't want to see that witch's face. Go on. Sister-in-law told me you don't get along with your Aunt. That is why she didn't tell you. And sister-in-law also said... I just remembered... I won this in a game versus my sister-in-law. Shall we play jungle-jungle? Alright. Take this camel. This tortoise is mine. Tortoise. - Tortoise. And is this us? This isn't us. These are children. Ours? Not ours. The parrot's. Let's fight. My tortoise will come. You are so nice, Nikka. You try so hard to help me get settled. Sister-in-law scared me. But I have really started liking it here. Put it properly, brother. I will fix it properly. It shouldn't trouble me on the way. Am I fixing it for the first time? I have spent my entire life doing this. Brother, write a love letter for me too. I have to give it to Charno. I will beat you black and blue. Do you understand? He doesn't know how to wipe his nose and look at this Romeo. And if you don't get good marks this time, watch how I punish you. Will you have some tea with cardamoms? No, head teacher, you can have it. I have a class. - Your wish. Doctor! Fill the bowl with milk. Where is your brother? - He left from outside. Alright... Do you have my stuff? Doctor, where is your stuff? - I don't have your stuff! He got married. He is fooling you. He has gone to get bangles for sister-in-law. I swear to God, there is nothing between us. We sleep separately too. Saawan, I will get hurt. I will get hurt. You found her very pretty, right? Now I know! Really... really I am not lying. She sleeps on the bed, I sleep on the cot. I spend the entire night reading your letters. No one listened to me. They made me a sacrificial lamb. Don't worry. We will get married secretly. There are secret diseases not secret marriages. I trust you a lot. But I want to hear this from her. If you have betrayed me, Sardar, you will see my dead face. Couldn't you tell me earlier? Stupid fool. What is this, brother? Fool, I fed you so many candies, you couldn't keep your mouth shut? Leave me, brother. I won't spare you. Get up. - Let me go, brother. You monkey. Get up. - Let me go. "God is playing games with us." "Her heart should have love for me even if it is a little bit." "God is playing games with us." "Her heart should have love for me even if it is a little bit." "If we lose, all our joy will be lost." "The kite of love will be stolen from the sky." "The kite of love will be stolen from the sky." "She wanted a mansion of coloured glass." "Of coloured glass." "Even if it's a small piece." "God is playing games with us." "Her heart should have love for me even if it is a little bit." "I have kept a red dress full of dreams." "I have so much hope in my heart." "I have so much hope in my heart." "Put the coin of love in my lap." "Even if it is worthless." "God is playing games with us." "Her heart should have love for me even if it is a little bit." "God is playing games with us." "Her heart should have love for me even if it is a little bit." "God is playing games with us." "Her heart should have love for me even if it is a little bit." "God is playing games with us." "Her heart should have love for me even if it is a little bit." Here you go. Take this. You drink first. You drink first. That's it. Today you will one sip and I will take one sip. Roop, I want to talk to you about something. Why just one thing? You can talk to me as much as you want. Roop, your sister-in-law who came to see you earlier... Yes... That clever one. Yes... She and I have something going on. Not from now, from before the wedding. I went to the wedding also so that he family could meet me. But things went wrong. Your grandmom noticed me. No one listened to me there. I was scared... But now Saawan has found out about my wedding. I told her that we have nothing between us. We both got stuck out of helplessness. And you don't like me from the very first day. We spent all our lives fighting. Saawan told me that she wants to hear this from you. That there is no relation between us. Its' okay, I will tell her. You have done so much for my honour... This is the least I can do for you. No, I had forgotten, I don't drink leftovers. I will get another one for me. Sure there is nothing between you? I can swear on anyone, there is nothing between us. If your family hadn't asked for dowry, we wouldn't be standing here today like this. I know your brother was wronged. - Forget about him. He got married into a good family. My sister-in-law is very nice. Who is that, brother? She is your sister-in-law. Which one? The purple one or the pink one? The jury is out on that. They are both beautiful. Do one thing, keep the one you want. Give me the other one. I didn't say anything... I will beat you. - Let me go. What happened? Leave him. How will I leave him? He is the one who is sitting on top of me. Rather, you should save me from him. Are you done talking? Go away. Brother, this is my land. Who is he? Actually, my name is Virender. The villagers call be Senior Subedar... Forget about him. Are you done talking? Do you believe me now? Let's meet tomorrow then. We didn't tell anyone at home that we are going out. Shall we go? I accept the decision, brother. I will accept this crazy one too. Let's go. Tell me your trick at least. You have two by your side I can't even find one. Will you come to meet me tomorrow? He will. Are you alright? - Yes. Is your daughter-in-law alright? - Yes, she is. It's alright. God will make me unwell. Oh, I had forgotten. They have been married for three months. God should have made her unwell by now. I wonder what these kids keep doing. Play with this. Take this. I have the cards and you don't. You have lost. Play with this now. I'll do it. - No, I'll do it. I'll do it quickly. You must listen to me. You don't do it properly. I will do it. I said give it to me. - You don't do it properly... We'll finish it quickly and sleep quickly. No. Give it to me. I'll do it quickly. - No, I will do it. Thank God, the boy is sleeping here. Take this, grandmom. Roop... Are your bangles all there? Yes, grandmom. - Not even a single one is broken? No... Nikka, you are sleeping in the day. Didn't you sleep last night? No, grandmom. I defeated her seven times last night in card games. She tried very hard but your grandson kept winning. Damn it. My son is absolutely innocent. He knows nothing about the worldly affairs. What will God do? Mom? - Yes? Give me your blessings. Have some sweets. God bless you. What is this for? My wife had our fourth son last night. We have two pairs of boys now. Congratulations. Listen. - Yes? Our son is very naive. Teach him something. Mom, I already knew this. You are barking up the wrong tree. It won't lead to anything. - Shut up. Do what I asked you to do. Alright, I will try. Come on, Mangal. Don't worry, brother. Whatever the nature made, it shouldn't be messed with. Now you think about it, moon only looks beautiful in the night. What is the use of a man banging against another man? That would be messing with the nature, right? And don't worry about the rest. There is a clinic in front of the Ludhiana bus stand. I will take you to him. You will be perfectly alright. Don't worry. Tell me freely. What are you talking about? Brother, do what you like. Tell me what's going on? - Why did I get stuck here again? Mangal, save your life. Otherwise, you'll have to go to the Jogi's clinic. The old woman wants a child from him. And he looking for men. Run, Mangal, run. Do you have lipstick, Roop? Yes, I do, grandmom. - Wear it. And apply some powder too. Alright? Friend. - Yes? We may be shy outside it suits our sons and daughters. While sleeping in the night, you hang the milk so that the cat doesn't drink it, right? Hang your shame there too. Why should you feel shy from your husband? And its not necessary to follow men. You should follow your heart too. Roop... are you understanding what I am trying to tell you or not? Yes, grandmom. Alright then. I want your bangles to be broken tomorrow morning. That's it. Otherwise, I won't talk to you. Do you understand? What happened to my child? - Mom hit me. It's alright. I will beat that witch. Don't cry. She beat my child? Will you sleep with me tonight? No, I will sleep with sister-in-law. No, child. I will tell you stories in the night. I will sleep with sister-in-law! There. That was all we needed. Look at him. Come, child. I will sleep with sister-in-law. It's okay, grandmom. Let him sleep here. Come, don't you want a little nephew? Where will he come from? - God will tear the roof and sleep with your sister-in-law. I will see it too. - You can see it later. Come now. Grandmom, I want to see. - Come! Get up or else. - Grandmom, I want to see. This boy doesn't listen at all... Grandmom, where did I come from? - I don't know. I'll ask grandad then. Go to sleep quietly. Grandad doesn't know wither. Child, don't do anything stupid. Come, my child. Come and sleep here. Sleep on the pillow. Grandad? - Yes? Where did I come from? Get up! Don't ask stupid questions. Crazy boy, is this what you should ask? Go from here. Run! So? Did you ask your grandad? Now got to sleep quietly. Naajar. - Yes? The desires of true hearts are fulfilled by God himself. Our Nikka doesn't have a child. We will get him married again. - Alright. The whole village mocks us that have you played Sadiq on the wedding? Now... on Nikka's wedding, old Gura's word... will come true. And Sadiq will be there. - He will be. Dad is here! Come, Doctor! - Did you get anything for me? Look inside, there's so much stuff. And start the truck so you can learn how to drive. Bravo! My darling! The old man wants to get Nikka married again. I am telling you, talk about my sister right now. Listen to me. - I have heard enough. Now don't come inside unless you talk to the old woman. Move aside. Leave me alone. - What happened, grandmom? Tell me where the rope is. Let me hang myself first, then you can get married again. Grandmom... - Grandmom, don't do this. Don't you want to see my kids? Scoundrel, if you were a girl, I would have got you married off and sent you away. I am going to die today. Grandmom, listen to me... Grandmom, please. - Grandmom, wait. Let her do it, silly boy. She is doing something appropriate for the first time. Enemy, let Sadiq sing at my funeral. Then you can be homeless like Naajar and you'll come to your senses. Tell me where the rope is? I want to die. Do you really want to die? - Absolutely. There you go, today your father's tree has become useful. Dad. - Yes? Dad, I want the rope. Take it after some time. Wait here. Let our important work be finished. Grandmom... Just come up for a minute. See if it fits your neck. Mom, have you gone mad? What will do with your things? Distribute them before you die. We'll end up fighting with each other later over them. Get lost! Should I give you my necklace right now? Grandmom, come up here. Go on, sister-in-law. Move ahead. And you may tell my wife that Naajar is fine. Grandmom, put this down. Listen to me. Listen to me. - Listen, friend. Let whoever wants to die, die today. I will give you my insurance. And I will get you married again. Run! - Hurry up. Where are you running now? Don't shoot me. - Get away from me. Run! She's coming! Pick up your shoes. Tell your brother to pick up his too. Go on, show me. What happened now? Beat her, beat her! Beat me now. You try as well. You fool! You keep provoking me all the time. Get lost from here! You want both of us to fight? Don't you dare enter my home again! Speak up now. Cat got your tongue now? He is staring like newly littered female dog now. You are carrying this gun like this... If this goes off, you will really be hung to death. Then how will I live? Grandmom, may I say something? Please, don't get angry. I really want to wash baby clothes. Everyone has agreed. You say yes too. Agree to what? It's not necessary that you can't become a mother. There could be something wrong with him too. No, mom. Something is wrong with me. It is not the end of the world. We can go to a doctor. Grandmom, why should we ruin the peace of our family? People will make a thousand stories. Grandmom, I don't know, for my sake, please, say yes. Please, grandmom, now she has sworn too. And you are getting angry as if grandad is getting married again not me. She is calm. If I were in her place, I would let the enemy re marry. Rather, I would get married again. And I will have a long line of children and distribute the land to all of them. Then he will learn. Scoundrel, who knows what magic they have done on this girl? She is supporting him too. Listen, boy. If you get a second wife, I won't keep any relation with her at all. And I don't have any jewellery for her. And girl, beware, if you try to give her your jewellery. Now it is up to him and to the enemy. Yes, you should get me killed. I can't find even one. And you want two. First, you have snatched their daughter-in-law. Now you want their daughter. They will start beating me on sight. No, absolutely not. I shall not be your mediator. It is hard pass for me. You want to have all the fun and I should be the one who gets into trouble. Wise guy. You have picked the right animal for yourself. It's fine then. Uncle Buta wants me to marry his sister-in-law. I shall marry her then. Uncle, what is your enmity with me? I was better off single. She doesn't even let me have tobacco. I used to keep it in my pockets. Look, she took my pockets off. I hid it in cuffs, she took off the arms. I started hiding it in my pyjamas, she placed elastic wands inside them. I beg you, take your niece away. I won't go today, I won't go tomorrow. And I won't let you take drugs either. Get lost! You act so smart! Where is my tobacco? - Here, I will rub it for you. Look, Saudagar Singh, we won't marry our daughter to a man who is already married. You may leave. This drama is going to continue for us. Wait. When the first match didn't take place, he made life hell for us. Now he want to leave her. He will embarrass us completely by the time saawan gets married. The family is good... Saawan has agreed too. Aunt, you have made a wise choice. The choice is wise, but first they need to give the first wife, five acres and separate her. Secondly, you are saying she can't have a child now. If she has a child tomorrow, I will send this crazy boy with an axe then. He will chop off your head too with the mother and child. Look at your face. Take his arm and leave him there. He can live with them after marriage. Why do I need him when he doesn't listen to me? Roop will neither leave this house today nor tomorrow. The house seems empty without a child. Dad's tree is not blooming. Alt east, let our roots flourish. - Let it be. What are you going to do with such a child? He is such a bad son, his offspring will be just like him too. Scoundrels, don't you feel even a little pity for the poor child? Here comes Roop's grandmom. She will do your wedding rituals. Sister, you have been very good to us. There is the dagger, and here is the boy. Slit his throat. You have my permission. Gurditt Singh, say something. What should I say? You didn't let me speak that day. I cried enough for you to return. Now that I am here, I will fix the marriage and go. Shouldn't we think about our family? She is here with her army. Are you alright? Daughter, do you have such a poor destiny? My daughter, I pushed you into the well myself. It's alright, grandmom. You don't know anything, Roop. You are a child. Go and make some tea. Sister! What did I know? That I am taking my girl from evil people and handing here over to even more evil one? Where is the other girl from? We don't know anything. Saudagar brought the match,. If the children's father was alive today, he would have killed your nephew by now. His funeral ceremony would have been in a week from now. And you! If you don't put him down when he enters the village, I won't give you an inch of land. I will donate it all to the Gurdwara. Grandmom. - Yes? You don't have the moon in your hands. How can I have a moon when I'm cursed? Give me a roti. He doesn't have any shame. He is exactly like the enemy. First, he was adamant and brought Buta's wife home. He said we must marry into that family. I was so much against it. But, no. They brought that witch home. Grandmom, what is Aunt's fault in this? Didn't she have a tongue? Couldn't she say that she will have a child? What is the need to get married again? But, no. Everyone is self-centred. No one is good. You alone... - I can stay alone. Anyway, we live separately. What will happen if I shift from here? Don't worry about me. Ten multiplied by one is ten. Ten multiplied into two is twenty. Ten into three is thirty. - Fools! Go and write it down. A man may sacrifice his life for you. You won't value it at all. I don't know why she has sworn not to listen to me. There is no value for my feelings. I tie a new turban and come everyday. What happened to him today? I told him that I am getting married. Head teacher! I will have tea too today and so will my fiancé. What happened? You are very quiet. What did Roop say about what my mom suggested? -She said she accepts it. -She agreed? Then you should be happy. But you don't look happy. Are... - I... I have not thought about anyone but you. Why won't I be happy? Just start preparing to come to my house. Go on, hurry up and do it. I am tired, sister-in-law. Go on, come on. You fill a huge bowl while eating. Roop... What are you doing, daughter? These will come in handy at the wedding. What are you made of? You are destroying your home yourself. What are you going to do with these? Can't you see the truth? Grandmom, I have married him in the presence of God. That is my truth. If your son is happy, I am happy too. I don't know how pretty she is. She won't ever match up to you. She is very pretty, grandmom. I have seen her. Big beautiful eyes, fair complexion... DO you know what beautiful grandchildren she will give you? You are worrying unnecessarily. Daughter, it is very easy to share houses. It is very difficult for a wife to share her husband. Grandmom, I had put some clothes to dry on the roof. Let me get them. "From a married woman," "I have become an unfortunate one." "What is this wound that you have given me?" "Our blooming garden has been torn to bits." "Our blooming garden has been torn to bits." "Our blooming garden has been torn to bits." "The henna has come off from my hands. I have remained a stranger." "I have remained a stranger." "The henna has come off from my hands. I have remained a stranger." "I have become famous everywhere." "My only woe will be that I died away from you." "My only woe will be that I died away from you." "What will happen to the village which is destroyed?" "My hopes and desires are scattered on the roads." "What will happen to the village which is destroyed?" "My hopes and desires are scattered on the roads." "There a million cases, and I have only won one." "My only woe will be that I died away from you." "My only woe will be that I died away from you." Go and get the notebook. I will write your love letter. I don't want to love. Sister-in-law is strong. She cries and consoles herself. I won't be able to cry. "Destiny became so cruel. My thoughts defeated me." "God came down himself to punish me." "Destiny became so cruel. My thoughts defeated me." "God came down himself to punish me." "You should tell me whether I am good or bad." "My only woe will be that I died away from you." "My only woe will be that I died away from you." "My only woe will be that I died away from you." "My only woe will be that I died away from you." Come on, son. Come on. - Stand here. Come along. That's it. You slapped me for no reason that day. I only came for Sadiq. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come. You, fool. I just slapped you. Your sister-in-law was about to shoot you. I saved you. - Really? Uncle, I need to meet Saawan. Have patience now. You want to get me killed not meet her. I don't know. I must meet her right now. Where are you going? - I need to go to the bathroom. We will go to the bathroom too. Come on. Get up. He will create a problem. Give us some drinks. - Are you dead? Bring some tea. Come on, come on, nephew. Where is Nikka? What is this? This is lying here. Where did he go? Nikka! - Nikka! Don't call out his name. Look for him! Nikka! - Nikka! Are you blind? Remove that from your face. He spilled all my tobacco. Sister, your bangles are looking so pretty. What are you doing sitting here? The groom is distributing rings outside. Really? - Yes. Run quickly. Go quickly. Hurry up, silly. Sardar, what are you doing here? Someone will see you. Saawan... - Yes? I can't go ahead with this marriage. By the way, she wasn't even that pretty, Sardar. Now I know why you used to get away like that. Saawan... it's not like that. Let me accuse you of something... To console myself... Look... God makes these unions in heaven. Maybe that is what God wanted. Alright then. Lets listen to your God. I am giving you my sigh. Tell her to make it a hiccup and keep it. Now don't act so nice... that it becomes difficult to forget you. "Our life is in" "the heaven's hands." "I had no idea that" "this cruelty will happen to me." "No one is closer to me" "than you." "I did not" "expect this from you." "I agree that I had nothing." Sardar, your son ran away. Ran away? - Ran away? We have heard about the girl running away so many times, this is the first time I am hearing about a boy running away. Gure, your family is crazy. Whatever happens now and even if Sadiq doesn't sing in this wedding, we will definitely get into trouble. I already knew this was going to happen. He was bound to run away. Give me some more of these. Sir, the groom ran away. - What? Gather our stuff quickly. Hurry up. - Okay, sir. There will be trouble now. - Come on, let's gather our stuff. Let's run. Grandmom, its Nikka. How did he come back? Roop. Roop. Didn't your family even teach you this much? That when your husband comes, you should give him a glass of water? Or do you only know how to hide and cry? Their old woman said that you didn't throw her out before you came. Do one thing, gather your stuff and go to Mangal's house. I will give you five acres when I return. Go. What is this? Kids. - Whose? Parrot's. Not the parrot's. They are ours. Tell me one thing. What we felt for each other that is called love. What is that called the one you feel for me? Stop it now. I am not getting married. Swear by me. - I am really not getting married. Roop, I will get hurt. If you are going to beat me then I am leaving. Go. Move and show me. Go on. Let's see how you leave. - Roop... I will scratch your face. Roop, you will beat your husband? God will punish you. Grandmom. I won't get married again, grandmom. I will do whatever my grandmom says. Forgive me. Thank God, you came to your senses. Friend, should we forgive him? Or should we pull his ear? I think the wedding procession has retuned. Grandad will beat me. Grandad got beaten. - I think your grandad got beaten. Grandad got beaten black and blue. Grandad got beaten black and blue. - Carry me properly. My bones are broken. Be careful. - He got beaten black and blue. Grandad got beaten... Where is your dad? They beat him so much his clothes were torn. He has gone home to wear pants. - Shame on you. I will teach you a lesson. You were so excited for this wedding. Good this happened. They all deserved to be beaten. I will beat you too. I found out today that a bachelor should never be anyone's mediator. Did you get your wedding gifts? Never mind. Whatever happened is very nice. You didn't go to listen to Sadiq, you went to get beaten. And you're back after that. All of this happened because of your beloved grandson's actions. The girl's family beat us so badly that I can't even tell you. Why are you standing there and smirking like that? You are always getting so close to her, I will die but I won't give you even a tiny piece of my land. Alright, fine. Don't do it then. Take everything with you when you die. You got beaten so badly, and you're still acting so arrogant. Where is your Sadiq? Who sticks around when people are getting beaten sister-in-law? He picked up his instruments and ran away. How could he run off like that? Didn't you pay him? Call him back again. Today my wish has come true. I will call Sadiq. Why are you sitting so quietly? Play some music! What are you looking at? - What are you doing? I came here to jump. Really? Go ahead then. I don't have the courage. - Then don't do it. As it is you have been coming here every day for a month. You haven't jumped till now. Why do you come here? I come here thinking... when you will jump, and when I will save you. Forget it, I tell you. My heart has been freshly broken. That is my loss. I wanted to give you a fresh one in exchange of your broken one. What did you say your name was? Virendar... The villagers call me Senior Subedar. Action!
