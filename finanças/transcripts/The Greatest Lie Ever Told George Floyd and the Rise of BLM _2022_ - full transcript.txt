Is the driver in there? Which one? That blue one over there. Step out and face away. Please don't shoot me, Mr Officer! Please! Don't shoot me man! Step out and face away. Can you not shoot me man?! I'm not shooting you, step out and face away. Okay! Okay! Okay! Please! Please! Please, man! Please! Please! I didn't know, man! Get out of the car. I didn't know, Mr Officer! Hey! Stay in the car! Stop resisting then! I'm not! Yes, you are! I can't breathe... I can't breathe... Well, you got him down man! Let him breathe at least man! I can't breathe... I can't breathe... I have decided to do this video, it has been weighing very heavily on my heart. I..uhm..want to come out and say, that I do not support George Floyd and the media depiction of him as a matyr for black america. I'm going to explain why, and I hope that some of you guys will understand where I'm coming from. I want to be clear this is not a defense for Derek Chauvin. I hope Derek Chauvin gets the justice that...uhm... that he deserves to be...uhm... implimented upon him, and that the family of George Floyd deserves justice. Okay Interview take two. Quiet all around please, we're rolling. It was just gut instinct you know, It just felt like we were being told "Look over here" "Look over here" and I guess part of personality is when I feel that way and somebody's going "Focus only here, only here, only here" I wanna know "Okay, but what about...over there?" And it wasn't personal, at least not in the beginning, it wasn't personal. I would say, it certainly wasn't personal, until, er...this video was just... it was just so disgusting. but I think its important to understand how easily people can be corrupted into saying this type of disgusting nonsense. Candace Owens That rotten bitch. If anybody is just gonna pretend to get their feelings hurt about what we say about Candace Owens I will laugh and laugh and laugh. I don't care what this ****ker did! I don't care if he personally, kicked Candace Owens in her stinky pussy! I don't know if it stinks but I imagine it does. Then that moment, it became personal. And I thought, not only am I gonna say the truth, I am going to scream the truth, louder than you can scream the lies. "I never been so..." "...hurt inside." "this was the second time he exhibit that behavior." "23/24 hours in the cell." "I have been a police officer for almost 4 decades..." "Until the very breath, was squeezed out of him" "...that was the very last time I seen Floyd" "if you sentence my son, you will also be sentencing..." "Everyday...everyday..." "Justice is George Floyd, going home tonight." You guys know him best so... who was George Floyd? Outside this grocery store, is now home for a memorial. We protest peacefully, kinda just helping each other out, and rallying together as a community. We need to stand together with each other. We're here to serve justice for injustice. Say his name. George Floyd! Say it again Say his name! George Floyd! Breaking news in South Minneapolis, the situation has become dangerous. "...breaching the gate at the 3rd Precinct." "We're getting calls they're blocking us in" "Is anyone copying this?" ALL LIVES MATTER! YOU WANT MORE OF YOUR PEOPLE TO DIE?! YOU COWARDS! "3rd Precinct has been compromised." "They're going to breach the barricade!" "3rd Precinct is up in flames." "Minneapolis is waking up to a lot of its buildings..." "...on fire." "We saw chaos just..." "...erupt." "Fires are still burning." "We're seeing looting throughout this city" "Bricks are being thrown at police officers" "We're seeing increasing violence amongst protestors throughout the country." "Cities are erupting into chaos and violence." "How long can you be peaceful..." "...when your people are dying?" "We're out here tryna' show them that we're angry" "This is not just about George Floyd..." "its about everything thats happening in our world" For whatever reason, it has become fashionable Over the last 5 or 6 years, for us to turn criminals into heroes overnight. And it is something I find to be despicable, and it is something that I refuse to stand by any longer, and I am not going to play a part in it. No matter how much pressure comes from black liberals and black conservatives as some token of people wanting you to believe that this is the only way you can be black is you have to say "This was wrong and that this person was amazing." I won't do that. Why are we pretending that this criminal should be upheld as a citizen? as a matyr? in black america? a matyr for a fake narritive by the way. People were shocked. Right? They had all thrown themselves in, emotionally. Based on the media narritive, and they just sorta thought, "How could the media not have told us this?" So right now, I am researching Alvin and Theresa Scott. They were George Floyd's last known roommates. And we basically just had our producers reach out and say "We're working on a documentary pertaining to George Floyd." that was kinda the only infomation that we gave them, in the hopes that saying my name would not scare them away? At least from what I'm doing a cursory search there does not seem to be too much coverage on the roommates. Uhm... some pieces pertaining to how they were feeling during the trial. Some international coverage. But I definately don't remember these people being at the forefront. And he lived with them for... ...over 3 years. So, it would really interesting to see, what they have to say, if... ...they speak to me and don't slam the door at my face. Fingers crossed. Hello I'm... Alvin Manago, and I'm George Floyd's previous roommate. Prior to the death. This is our house and uhm... Give you a little walkthrough and uhm... tell you a little bit about our relationship, me and Floyd. yeah and err... this is us on 4th of July... err... and these are our co-workers. We both worked together at the Conga Lounge in Minneapolis, Minnesota And th-thats Floyd right here. They never forgot him because he was a... a people person. He'd socialize and the kids was always all looking up like "Wow, that guy is pretty tall" Floyd was about 6'7" So we can uhm... head upstairs and I'll show you where Floyd room was. Mentioned we were roommates but, when I first moved here it was just me and Floyd. And er, Theresa later on moved in with us. This was his room. Much bigger, biggest room in the house and he was a big guy so heh err he always enjoyed it the difference was-was like he had a desk right here. And the only thing he always kept right there was, either his bible and... He smoked cigarettes and that was the only thing you'd see on his desk. We had some good moments here. It was like we lived together almost err... I guess... It was about 4 1/2 years almost 5 years. Him and Theresa often read the bible together Hello, how are you? Hi, very nice to meet you Alvin. Hey Theresa, how are you? So you guys in-- in many ways, were some of the people that were the closest to him. Yes. And I don't remember seeing your faces on the news, or anybody talking to you so... I guess lets just start with that. uhm... When was the first time you met George? I first met him... err... in 2017. We'd end up knowing each other... he was in the treatment center, and err...I actually had a--was there too. But I was there for the alcohol, and he was having problems with the pain pills. When we met, we was unaware that this was a-- that we both was in the same situation. So you guys met, and then you figured out you both were going to the same treatment center. And I think did that probably establish an instant connection between you two? Yeah, cause you know, during that time you talk about a lot of things that led you to where you were. And you get an idea of who the persons that are around you. Y'know more one on one. And he was real open about, things he was going through, what he wanted to be, his whole dream was to... ...get his life together. Have a good job. Be able to take care of his daughter as well as his family. He wanted a fresh start. He wanted to do better. And he happens to run into you, and this is a beautiful home. Addiction is hard. Yes. Its fullstop hard. Right. And... But... Y'know... Family is different. It's a different part of them. So the struggles that they may be facing out on the street, is just not something that they ever want to bring to their doormat. Sometimes a little urge to... ...get something stronger to kill the pain, took over and-- but he-- he always fought against that. That's interesting though. Because what you're saying is that So that night he just--he did--whatever they told him to do because he knew that not complying would end really bad. But what about-- Do you think that if he had complied, cause I'm sure you guys have seen the full tape by now, right? You must be thinking whadda, cudda, shudda... If he had that mentality going into it "Let me just do what they're saying" cause it's just such an escalation when you see the full tape of yeah he's not--maybe he's not feeling too good but yeah, then he's like "Put me on the ground" when he says "Put me on the ground" Do you ever look at it and go, Man, I wish that time he had taken--just taken his own advice and just been like "Okay guys, take me wherever you want to take me" Yes, yes, yes. Do you think that, a lot people maybe came out of the woodwork because there was an opportunity to grand stand, to be on stage, to... a lot of money got thrown around which is part of what I'm exploring in this documentary Black Lives Matter Global Network came out and said "We raised 90 million plus dollars" and they did this with his face. Just his face or saying you had some sort of association with him, could have gotten-- could have garnered a lot of people money. Do you think that people took advantage of him? Is... Is... like they... they uhm... they use it... as a--whatchu said--a way of funding whatever they... motivation was... and sometimes when I went to the George Floyd memorial, it was different individuals going around there saying "Donations for this/for Floyd/for this" And you didn't know where they was coming from, you got a little metal box and "I don't know who you are or where is this going." Y'know to meet with president and the vice president, and for them to share their concerns to our family, and for them to actually give an ear, to our concerns, and how we feel on the situation. And I have to be strong, because thats what he would want me to do Four years now. He just-- They never wanted his stuff? I mean I would think that if my son-- That was my oldest brother. I loved him. I'm never gonna get my brother back I would like to just like see him one day, just meet his daughter because its like, thats an extension of him. just to be proud to just to see one time. You guys, thank you so much. What a pleasure to sit here and talk to you guys. It was just absolutely amazing. You imagine how absolutely traumatized that child was. And then you think to yourself, just a few years later, you will have children, that are wearing his shirt. Refering to him as a hero. As some sort of... ...savior. That's wrong. It's not right at all. And... it was this case, that I couldn't stay quiet on. And I had to make that video. In 1998, he spent 10 months in prison, for theft with a firearm. In 2002, he spent 8 months in prison for a cocaine offence. In 2004, just two years later, he spent another 10 months in prison for a cocaine offence. By the way, I am not saying that, if you have a record that you don't deserve a second chance. But I do draw the line when it comes to 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th and 9th chances. Two things can be true at once. You can both say, that... George Floyd didn't deserve to die. No matter how you believed he died. Nobody deserves to die. In my opinion. And you can also say, that objectively... this person... that did die... was not a saint. This person was not an angel. Okay so, my producer just sent me... a link and a minute mark, for George Floyd's 2019 arrest, which I haven't seen. So I'm about to watch it for the first time. Okay. This is super interesting because... He's saying "Momma" again, And obviously, I know that throughout the trial, his girlfriend... testified that he calls her "Momma" And the media made such a big deal saying that, "When he died, he cried out for his Momma" And they clearly misinterpreted that because... this 2019 arrest, he's once again saying "I want Momma" so that seems pretty clear that he's talking about... his girlfriend. And he's not crying out for his mother which was a nice... victim narritive. You and Floyd. Mr Floyd, excuse me. I'm assuming like most couples... had pet names for each other? Yes And what were you saved in his phone as? Momma What's crazy in the retrospect is to realize that... everybody reacted. Nobody knew who George Floyd was. But also, nobody knew who Derek Chauvin was. Literally nothing. And my heart breaks for her obviously. Like hearing...like she's obviously just devastated But... she's being told by his lawyer to say absolutely nothing. So she's not gonna come on camera. She's not gonna participate. He's not gonna come on camera or participate because they have a pending appeal. And my frustration, and what I expressed to her is I'm just like... So your strategy for the appeal is the same thing that your strategy was during the entire trial. Silence Allow the media to tell the story. I said to her I literally said "This might be the only opportunity, that you guys have" "You've already lost in the court of public opinion" "So, how is it going to hurt you..." He's lost, right? "How is it going to hurt you..." "to allow his voice to be heard and to tell the story from his side?" Nothing The lawyer is running the show and I think its the worst strategy. There's just no way he's gonna win in the court of public opinion by just saying nothing. Super frustrating, but thats a dead end. I can't imagine... raising up a child, and loving a child, and knowing who he is. And watching the media... in virtually, minutes. Be able to strip to that person of their identity and to create a new identity for them. I felt her pain. I did. I just... I felt her pain and I felt that... the only thing we could offer to do... was... to expand. On who Derek Chauvin actually was. People were... were taking a picture, a--not even a picture, a still. From a video. And saying, Satan This is your Satan. People were taking... a... a storyline... that was given to them. From the media. And saying, "Here it is" "George Floyd, he's your hero." "That's it" "That's the story" "The End" It's insane. You You know You know Derek You know Derek Chauvin. I do. I was Minneapolis Police Officer for 31 years. Is it the same Derek Chauvin the media has introduced the world to? Not at all. Derek is... quiet. Somewhat quirky. Not a big guy. Very dependable. Shows up to work everyday. Derek is the kind of guy that you want to show up on your calls with you. He's very level-headed. Derek... When I first supervised Derek, I was a Sergeant. And I was running a unit for Homeland Security. Derek got assigned unto my unit. And at the time, he was living with his mom. Which I thought was admirable that he wanted to help take care of his mom. Derek is a quiet, thoughtful, honorable, and self... selfless man. He has a big heart. And he always has put others before his own. He was... kind've a guy that was a little more of a loner. uhm... Y'know some probably would have considered him socially awkward. You described him as 'Quirky' and somebody else kinda described him in that same way what did you mean by that? Kinda quiet. Introverted. Sometimes he wears his like--his uniform pants a little high on his boots. uhm... Just that way. Y'know-- Maybe not the quarterback of the football team. Not the quarterback of the football team. Did he ever have any issues with other police officers? Was there ever any... any signs that he was particularly violent or had issues with people because of... their skin color? No. Never. Nope. That is not the Derek I knew. And I-- I-- I don't believe... what... people are saying... It's made up. It's not true When you sentence my son... you will also be sentencing me. Plus, the fact when he is released... his father and I most likely will not be... here. Where is Derek today? Derek is at Oak Park Heights Prison. He sits in a cell for 23/24 hours a day. He... does not have any... reading materials, no TV, no computer, no nothing, he just sits in a cell. And... And thats it. You sit and look at the four walls in your cell, every single day. What was your initial reaction when you saw that video? In terms of, looking up and seeing "Hey!" "That's Derek Chauvin, I know that guy!" He's somebody that would be hard to read for most people. But-- But, nice guy. So when you looked up at his face, you didn't see a monster. You just saw... Derek, looking like as Derek has always looked, and the media perhaps... reading into it. They-- They-- They read into something that was not there. That is not the Derek that I knew. All of our department was painted with that same brush. Which is unfair. And its... its a lot of false narratives. Because we have a good department. And we heard earlier that he is spending... 23 hours a day in solitary confinement. Do you ever... think about... his mental state? Everyday. Everyday. You don't wish that on anybody. There is an incredible amount of stress, in the job alone. More or less, if somebody dies in your custody, thats about the worst thing that you can go through as a person and a police officer. George Floyd was a semi-regular customer. He'd come around... not so often but he was someone we'd recognize. And he'd come here maybe... to pay his phone bill or get phone services. So anytime a customer brings a counterfeit bill, and you'd see, we have plenty of them, We tell them "Hey, this is counterfeit" If the customer insist, then we call the police. Then the police has to ask them where they got it from. And that really hasn't ever happened. In my... experience here, whenever we tell a customer that a bill is counterfeit, they immediately... leave. Because they don't wanna be involved with it. Just from our experience. There's some good ones, but a lot of times we know right away that there're fake just because of the way they... have the color disfiguration. By the way they feel. The way they look. So... usually we don't call the police on counterfeit money because... when we tell the customer that its fake, they accept the fact and just leave. When he came in the store, he was with a friend of his. The friend of his was... paying for... some electronics repair. And... all of the money he had was counterfeit. because we know the person we told him "Hey..." "We're not going to call the police, just take this money back and don't bring it back here again." And then a few minutes later, George Floyd made a purchase at the tobacco shop, with a counterfeit bill. And... an employee then called the police. They arrived about 45 minutes later, and found George Floyd in his car. And... thats when they... approached him. I'm Dr Ron Martinelli, Forensic Criminologist, and certified medical investigator, and police practices expert. Let me just preface this, I have no dog in the fight here. We classically get a lot of officer involved shootings and in-custody deaths But we take them from all sides. So my advocacy, is for facts and evidence. Not for people or entities. So if the officers are doing, what they are supposed to be doing as they were trained to do it. I'm gonna tell you. If they're not, I'm also gonna tell you that. What was your assessment of the police behavior in seeing the full video, and seeing how things played out? They made contact with Mr Floyd and that is totally appropriate because they're investigating a third person's report of criminality. So for the officers, what they have to do... is they have to begin an investigation. To ask him probative questions, seeking more evidence. To determine, Whether Whether a crime Whether a crime has occured. So once they put the handcuffs on Mr Floyd, Mr Floyd should've known albeit he's under the influence of drugs. That he must Obey the officer's directions, orders, and command. He cannot resist arrest. And so, when Mr Floyd... gets in a car, and he claims that he's claustrophobic Right, "Claustrophobic" is exactly what he said. I think if I was an officer I'd be saying "Wait a minute..." "You showed up in a car." "You wouldn't get in a car..." "if you thought you were claustrophobic." The officers placed him in a position thats referred to as the "Maximum Restraint" position In other words, he's proned, stomach down, on the ground. Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, Good morning. We plan to prove to you, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr Chauvin was anything other than innocent, on May 25th of 2020. Mr Derek Chauvin, used... excessive... and unreasonable force... upon the body... of Mr George Floyd. Until... the very breath... No, ladies and gentlemen, until the very life... was squeezed out of him. You would agree, Chief... that... from the prespective of Ms Ms Frazier's camera It appears that Officer Chauvin's knee... is on the neck of Mr Floyd. Yes. Would you agree that from the prespective of Officer Kueng's body camera, it appears that Officer Chauvin's knee was more on Mr Floyd's... shoulder blade. Yes. They had to have the jury believe... that it was... a neck restraint, it was the knee on the neck, it was asphyxiation, that killed George Floyd. However, there was a ton... of evidence... that George Floyd... consumed... a toxic... lethal... cocktail... of Fentanyl and Methamphetamine. I ate too many (unintelligible) Did it appear that Mr Floyd said "I ate too many drugs" ? Yes it did. Let's put it in prespective. 3 grains of Fentanyl on the head of a lead pencil enough to kill you, enough to kill me. And so they had to continuously, inculcate the public... to believe that Derek that Derek Chauvin intentionally, premeditatedly, murdered George Floyd and drugs had absolutely nothing to do with it! As Lindsey and the toxicologist, presented that awful testimony. Do you recall describing the level of Fentanyl as a fatal level of Fentanyl? I recalled describing it in other circumstances it would be a fatal level, yes. In other circumstances. Had Mr Floyd been home alone in his locked residence, with no evidence of trauma, and the only autopsy finding was that Fentanyl level, then yes. I would certify his death as due to Fentanyl toxicity. I know I can't breathe! I can't breathe! I can't breathe! I can't breathe! Take a seat! I can't f**king breathe! Here, come on out! The autopsy is generally brokened down by number one, how the body is presented. and what his height and weight is, and then it goes through the neurological system. Exterior trauma. Interior trauma. But I go right to the cardiovascular system. And there, I look at the heart weight. How much does the heart weigh? And then, I take a look for key for key words I compare the heart weight, to the... height and weight of the individual, to what the toxicology report says and I look for certain words or evidence of something called "Cardiomegaly" Cardiomegaly means an enlarged heart. If a person has cardiomegaly their chances... of sudden of sudden cardiac of sudden cardiac arrest rise by a rise by a hundred rise by a hundred and fifty rise by a hundred and fifty times. Not a 150% A hundred and fifty times That is significant. And then we have the whole issue... of... the police encounter, and the basal metabolic rate rising. Think about him being agitated, chaotic excited And his heart is And his heart is pumping And his heart is pumping, pumping And his heart is pumping, pumping, pumping There is zero There is zero empirical There is zero empirical forensic There is zero empirical forensic evidence Medical evidence. Of Of any Of any biological Of any biological mechanism. Physiological mechanism that would've interfered with... George Floyd's... ability... to get sufficient oxygenated blood up into the brain. There's zero evidence of that! There was a...another passenger in the vehicle And that passenger was... Mr Floyd's drug dealer. However, he did not end up... providing helpful testimony because... of his own criminal liability. I'm fearful of criminal charges going forward I have... open... charges thats not settled yet. Of my personal stuff. So basically you're invoking your Fifth Amendment right against Compelled Self-Incrimination? Yes sir. There was some evidence that came out... of chewed up pills that were found on the floor of the police car. Its very unclear to me why that evidence was not... obtained earlier and presented to the jury. But I think if the jury had seen the entire picture, not only of... Mr Floyd's drug dependency, his multiple prior brushes with law enforcement. But... his physical characteristics at the time... of the incident and his ultimate death. Absent the interaction with the police, he could easily have died with the amount of drugs in his system. With no knee on his neck or on his shoulder. And so, to me that would've suggested, if I were on that jury... reasonable doubt. But our system is such that a jury gets to decide that. Now there were other factors I think that polluted the jury's ultimate ruling. Ultimately the jury reached it's conclusion. We've got to get more confrontational. Make sure... that they--they know that we mean business. I want to see the charge of the arresting officer take place. We are not talking about a split-second decision, that was made incorrectly. I can't see'em come to a different answer there. Thank you. No, I have not yet. The verdict is in, in the case that has riveted the nation. The trial of Derek Chauvin. The former Minneapolis police officer was found guilty today, of killing George Floyd last May. I JUST WANNA THANK THE PROSECUTORS THE-- THE-- I JUST WANNA THANK GOD, THE DEA, EVERYBODY AMEN AMEN HALLELUJAH hallelujah And I hope every killer cop is watching and paying attention. Because today, The Black Lives Matter movement served notice on you. Theres a viciousness Theres Theres almost Theres almost a Theres almost a bloodthirst When one of these cases comes around. And nobody looks back, nobody asks any questions, nobody says sorry. It's just... you are being sacrificed so we build this temple of Black Lives Matter And there are so And there are so many And there are so many individuals, Who deserve to have their story told. So Liz, I wanna start with you so... being an anchor and having that position, how did you juggle... being married as well to a police officer in terms of covering stories? Well I went to our management right away, Before I even went on a date with Bob, as a matter of fact. To tell them, that I was... thinking about going on a date with this person at the time. And I said... ethically I don't feel comfortable covering police union issues and that was something that management was totally fine with So you mentioned that you were getting threats... on Twitter. And I'm assuming thats where it began Can you talk a little about what those threats were? I think they started immediately within...I think hours of the actual incident They said that "Bob Kroll and Liz Collin will be dead by the time the year ends" They came to the station where I worked and held a protest. During the 6 o'clock news, demanding that I be fired. For? Being married to a police officer. I'm seeing the story from so many different lenses. As a wife, as a journalist, but as a mom I think its where it... its where it hit me the hardest. I can imagine. In the early days, I'm calling friends "Hey, can you take Anthony? We have another..." "Hey, can you take Anthony? We have another death threat." or my parents are watching him for a few days He doesn't know whats going on. I mean you can't even explain this stuff to adults nonetheless a seven year old child. And he happened to see a little clip of the news... in the early days and said, "Wait a minute... "so the police made a mistake... "and they're stealing stuff from Target?" In his little mind he knew that this did not make sense. This isn't okay. So this was a Black Lives Matter organized protest, a hundred people were there, and we were out of town. After that happened, I sent an email to our newsroom And I said... "This seems newsworthy" There was a state rep candidate there, that was beating me in effigy they made piñatas of Bob and I dressed as klansmen. Woah woah woah Slow down here you're telling me that they made piñatas of you in effigy and they beat them? With bats. John Thompson did with a stick. In our driveway, this is the man running to be a state representative in Minnesota. In your driveway? Overwhelmingly elected. F**K BOB KROLL! AND F**K ANYBODY WHO SUPPORT HIS RACIST ASS! F**K BOB F**K BOB KROLL I SAID IT! I mean it was horrendous, absoulutely awful. And I got in trouble, for pitching that as a story. We had reporters tweeting their... alliance with Black Lives Matter using that hashtag. After this movement, talking about "Its okay to align yourself with this group" "and supporting Black Lives Matter" and that was fine. But I was no longer wanted there, and that was pretty clear. What was the process of making these? I mean... if you've ever been so angry you wanted to make a piñata. Thats where I'm at. Just f**k 'em Just aboslutely f**k 'em thats where I'm at. So when did you make the decision to leave? My contract was up in January of this last year. And I have been blackballed in the market. It-- I can interject It-- It destroyed-- They were successful in destroying her career. Because she had a wonderful Because she had a wonderful career trajectory going. She's a small town Wellington, Minnesota local, she was a local favorite, she was the primary fill-in for the two main anchors, she had a weekend anchor, the ratings that they had were huge. Everybody loved her. And then all of a sudden this twist. I watched it destroy her, and destroyed her career, something she was very good at. A lot better, quite frankly, than some of her competitors or her replacements. My name's Fraser Ross and I own retail stores in Los Angeles, California During the George Floyd protest that swept the nation, what happened? We were looted for over 400,000 dollars worth of merchadise. Wow. Its really-- It was a disaster. You then went online, and what did you observe that you thought was... out of the ordinary? Chrissy Chrissy Teigen Chrissy Teigen had posted on her Instagram, the thing--y'know "I'll help the protestors get out of jail." Then she said "Well, let me up it to another 100,000" Now when you have... approximately 30 million followers at the time, you can start a movement and people say "Oh well, she's gonna bail me out and everything" And then, y'know you got celebrities like Jennifer Garner giving four hearts to that post. Well they all live in gated communities, and its not their stuff being destroyed. And you had just been looted? Yeah, I went online and post an Instagram of the store being looted and I tagged "Thanks Chrissy" She wrote under this post "Well like anyones really shopped there for 10 years" So her instinct, after seeing that your store had been actually looted, her response is "Well, no one really shops at your store anyways" so she was not sympathetic to the victim in this circumstance Not one bit. But Jen Atkins was actually worse, Jen Atkins she's a friend of Chrissy Teigen you've tagged her in this post because you sell her products she comments on this post as well. Right Basically saying, "Use the shampoo to clean up the graffiti" "and my looting cream comes out in October" So they're having fun. They're mocking the looting. You should be in federal prison if you're inciting violence with that many people folowing you. So... Dana then decides to jump in... and call you and call you and Kitson and call you and Kitson a racist store. because you were upset... Right. that your store had was looted. Yeah This made you... a racist somehow. Right Right So this was quite literally blaming the victim. Then what happened? She sends a DM saying "Well before we get on the phone..." "you're gonna have to apologize to Chrissy Teigen" "and then I'll take down the post." Dana Omari from her Instagram account wrote exactly this, she's refering to Chrissy Teigen. So this blogger, just to recap, has essentially... jumped in on behalf of Chrissy Teigen. Right So we got on the phone for 53 minutes, and most of the coversation was, "You need to apologize to Chrissy Teigen" I said "I'm not apologizing to her, there's no reason to apologize to Chrissy Teigen" "But what are you looking for?" "You looking for money?" I was worried that how agrresive they were, and the looting was still approaching, and my main store, the value in that store is much greater than the one that got looted. Right, so because she's publicly posted your store... Right as being owned by a racist Right Right concerned that they were gonna come loot you some more. Who was the check written out to? To ActBlue To ActBlue? Right Which is BLM Black Lives Matter She was basically saying "If you make a donation to Black Lives Matter..." "I'll take down the post." Okay And then after she got off the conversation with me, she text me from her phone number "And if you don't make the donation..." "I'm gonna repost this, I'm gonna make it another post" "An unfortunate post that won't be good" So let me ask you a question. Chrissy Teigen Chrissy Teigen, Jen Atkins Chrissy Teigen, Jen Atkins, a blogger in which they both follow. Why do you think they felt the need to get involved on such a level, and to be so supportive of... the looting? Well I think they had-- there was a y'know... a side that they felt that they... it would help them become relevant and heroes and everything. Did Dana mentioned anything to you about Chrissy Teigen and her having a relationship? Yes, she said "Chrissy Teigen thanked me for what she did." Wow Yes So she thanked the blogger, Yes for calling you a racist. Yes And I guess... having an outraged mob, Yes descend on you online Yes My name is Charles and I grew up in Kenya. How long have you lived in Minneapolis? I came to Minneapolis in May of 1997. So it's been 27 years. 27 years. Yes What was this city... before the before the George before the George Floyd before the George Floyd riots? Well it was... just a typical midwestern city with... low crime and hardworking people. And... we just lived here and enjoyed life together. Yeah And then things took a bit of a turn, and this is... something different would you say? Well what we saw... was like... a venting of anger. It was complete opposite of Minnesota nice. And uhm.. we saw... anger anger, mayhem anger, mayhem, looting anger, mayhem, looting, destruction of property Burning of the police precinct. And it was And it was completely And it was completely foreign And it was completely foreign to me. I'm used to something like this, in third world countries. But... not in America. And quite honestly not in Minnesota. Not in Minnesota. This is uhm... something that I think I've... never seen before in any city that I lived in at least It says, 'You are now entering the Free state of George Floyd' What does that mean? It means this is an autonomous zone and it operates outside the laws of United States And anything that happens here, is run by a community and... they do whatever they want. They do whatever they want. How is that allowed in the United States? The city of Minneapolis, has has been has been negotiating Negotiating with whom? With the community. Wow So the city is being held hostage by... the community that is running the autonomous zone. Do I have that understood? Thats correct. Wow So we are now entering a state where really anything goes right? Really sort of 'Anything goes' right? Well... I think... anything goes here. We've seen death. We've seen a man shot... right in front of us. We've seen... a woman who was pregnant, shot right in front of us. And... right here. We had a huge bus Like a school bus and it was a clinic. It was a medical clinic. And the number one thing they were treating, during the time of the riots, was... gunshot wounds right here. As I'm looking around there's so many empty shops on the block. Things that are boarded up. How does that make you feel to see that? Is there ever going to be life again on this street? Well I feel like... There has been a tremendous loss of... the way of life here has changed. The economy, the destruction of... businesses. Most of the businesses here that were destroyed, their insurance would not be able to cover that. Right And so... its a hard thing for people to rebuild themselves. Especially after what they went through It almost seems like a vigil is being kept here. Well... this is pretty much... the body... of George Floyd. This is where he laid dead and breathed his last right here. And so the idea is that no one should enter this is sort of a sacred place, is that correct? Yeah, you can see this... is pretty much a holy ground. Now you're a pastor so I just wanted to ask you how does it make you feel knowing obviously who George Floyd was and how he lived his life to see that this has been transformed into a holy ground y'know as if this is where... Jesus Christ took his last breath. Well we have better... people to follow. Of course, Jesus Christ Dr Martin Luther King Jr. who have lived their lives and epitomized what we would like to emulate. Right Right And how does it make you feel, when you hear leaders saying that... the death of George Floyd is more significant than Martin Luther King? Its outrageous I guess I would've assumed when Black Lives Matter announced that they raised 90-- over $90 million dollars who knows how much over. On the back of the George Floyd... riots and the sprees... where is that money? I don't know Its not here Everything looks worse than it was. Is it possible that... black america was sorta used as a front and the emotions that black america was feeling was used as a front and... this money went... probably, maybe not to black people at all anywhere in the world. So many elements of people who took advantage of the death of George Floyd to starve the emotions for political gain for financial gain and to propagate division because some of these organizations that raised money they they can they can only they can only get they can only get money they can only get money if they can only get money if they they can only get money if they propagate they can only get money if they propagate hatred they can only get money if they propagate hatred and division They are not helping the community They are helping themselves Where have you seen that money impacted throughout the city? Democratic politics We got a car out there its just sitting there We couldn't do nothing with it because he didn't... they won't take it or move it And it's just shocking to me because of how much money was raised to think that where he lived the bills weren't being covered. So Black Lives Matter released their 990 IRS filings And of course, I wanted to jump right into it and find out exactly what happened to the approximate $80 million dollars that was raised by them between July 1st,2020 and June 30th, 2021 Okay, Vivek so... during the George Floyd death and the aftermath you were in Silicon Valley, is that correct? Yeah, I was running a biotech company actually and err.. I was CEO at the time, thats right. What was the corporate reaction in Silicon Valley? It was a pledge of alligience to one cause. To turn this man, who had died from a tragic death no doubt into some type of new modern messiah figure. And I thought that the religious quality of every company bending the knee was a bit odd. And... I was actually pretty keen on making sure that... I didn't lie to my employees that I didn't tell something that I didn't believe about this I sent an Employee All email and I said "Look I understand there's racial riots across the country" "There's unrest across the country, I hope everybody is safe" "Let us know if you need us to support you" that was about it. And I remembered the reaction that I got. That... somehow that failed to meet the moment. Because I didn't recite the same ritual incantation that every other CEO was pledging alligience to across the country. A corporate statement made by the same PR firm that effectively ended in "Black Lives Matter" Yeah, abosolutely. And we've been sorta investigating throughout this documentary Where did the money go, that was given to Black Lives Matter We've never even really got a full answer of how much money was given. I often say that BLM now stands for "Buy Lavish Mansions" because thats why the BLM movement does. You just saw in the recent weeks there was a person who was effectively working for BLM that personally purchased a mansion and she pays $3 million dollars for it. Within Within days I think its 48 hours later, flips that to the BLM organization who pays nearly $6 million dollars for that same house booking a personal profit to the person who actually brought it. So thats a self-dealing transaction, that enriches somebody personally who's working for Black Lives Matter Why is BLM buying big lavish mansions in the first place? When their donors were understandably outraged by the luxurious purchase, Patrisse Cullors came forth and also admitted that she hired both her mother and her brother to work at the property What sort of work you ask? Well Patrisse Cullors's brother Paul Cullors is a graffiti artist by trade thats what he's done his entire life he's done graffiti Patrisse instead hired her brother to do security for her She paid Paul $840,000 thats almost a million dollars in just one year to her graffiti artist brother his newly established security firm Now that makes her a great sister. But perhaps, she's an even better baby momma because Patrisse also gave funding from Black Lives Matter to take care of the man to take care of the man who to take care of the man who fathered to take care of the man who fathered her to take care of the man who fathered her son. His name is Damon Turner and he received $970,000 from BLM to his company Trap Heals LLC which purportedly provided live production and media So that makes Patrisse a great sister a wonderful baby momma and also by the way, she's a fun mom! Because one of the events Patrisse organized at her BLM mansion was for her young son's birthday party. Nothing says taking on police brutality quite like hosting a birthday for your young son in a Los Angeles mansion paid for by donors to the cause. Patrisse likes parties by the way, because she also threw a party there to celebrate the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Yeah, thats somewhat suspicious because... what do democrats have to do with Black Lives Matter? Think I'll just leave that question open ended. Also suspicious is the fact that Black Lives Matter designated a whopping $8 $8 million $8 million dollars to an out-of-country grant. What? I thought this charity was about addressing police brutality in the United States Apparently to do that you need to send $8 million dollars to Toronto, Canada to an organization named to an organization named M to an organization named M4 to an organization named M4B to an organization named M4BJ They purchased They purchased a $6.3 million dollar They purchased a $6.3 million dollar, 10,000 sqft They purchased a $6.3 million dollar, 10,000 sqft, downtown property They purchased a $6.3 million dollar, 10,000 sqft, downtown property in Toronto And I should almost mention that M4BJ is run by Patrisse's wife. Janaya Khan because it is she is the co-founder,believe it or not and here's where it gets and here's where it gets really and here's where it gets really interesting Janaya Khan is Janaya Khan is "gender non-conforming" these terms can be quite sensitive so let me just use photos to illustrate my point Janaya used to look like this and now she looks like this now that infomation would be entirely irrelevant if it wasn't for... the way Patrisse saw it fit to spend the rest of Black Lives Matter's money ready for some BLM pride? Well, according to their IRS form $200,000 went to the Transgender Justice Funding Project Another $200,000 went to the Transgender United Fund Another $200,000 went to the Transgender Law Center Another $200,000 went to the Black Transgender Media Another $200,000 went to the Transgender Gender-Variant & Intersex Justice Project Another $200,000 went to the Transgender District by the way, if you're wondering what that is its purportedly going to be the all transgender district and I guess thats really, really important for black america advancement in society I guess or whatever Another $200,000 went to the St James Infirmary that organization by the way is for according to their website is run by sex workers and is for them. Specifically Escorts Escorts, BDSM workers Escorts, BDSM workers, Strippers Escorts, BDSM workers, Strippers, Peep Show Workers Escorts, BDSM workers, Strippers, Peep Show Workers, Phone Sex Operators Escorts, BDSM workers, Strippers, Peep Show Workers, Phone Sex Operators, and Webcam Performers It was actually the St James Infirmary that created the Transgender District So thats just an organization within another organization Which by the way, you see a lot of when you go through these documents So yeah... going to be apparently great big things involving sex workers in the future for black america In continuation, the Center On Halsted received $200,000 from Black Lives Matter they are Chicago's community center dedicated to securing the health and well-being of Lesbian of Lesbian, Gay of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer people of Chicago Similarly, we have the Audre Lorde Project which received $200,000 and according to their website they're a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Two-Spirit, Trans, and Gender Non-Conforming People Of Color community organizing center. Another $400,000 went to Transgender Advocates Knowledgeable Empowering or TAKE as its known for short Founder of that organization is a transgendered individual by the name of Daroneshia Duncan-Boyd Daroneshia is also the executive director of the Transgender United Front which I mentioned earlier which secured $200,000 So a total $600,000 of BLM money went to a transgender woman named Daroneshia Boyd who is operating two charities I found that piece to be I found that piece to be very I found that piece to be very interesting Here is Daroneshia describing in a 2020 interview how they were able to use that money that was received to the organization to purchase more real estate. We're opening up a new resource center here and the resource center is almost almost three times as big as our last space that we was in uhm so...we have lotsa space and lotsa rooms for our class to come in and enjoy I noticed that real estate seems to be a common theme amongst these transgendered organizations remember theres the "first ever transgender district" and there are also a couple of houses that are named on their IRS documents For example, an additional $200,000 was given to The House of Tulip Who according to their website... The House of Tulip provides zero-barrier housing to trans and gender nonconforming people but the one that really stood out as the most nonsensical is the $200,000 that went to the Griffin-Gracy Retreat & Educational Center known as House of GG for short According to that website they provide services and resources that positively impact the lives positively impact the lives, history positively impact the lives, history, and visiblity of transgender, gender questioning, and gender non-conforming persons They admit that they purchased a property in Little Rock, Arkansas back in 2019. And that property was supposed to serve as a oasis and a retreat for transgender persons. But they admit also on the website that they actually never held such a retreat. First, because their founder had a stroke and was recovering. And then, it was Covid-19 so they still couldn't host the retreat. And despite having never hosted a retreat at this amazing oasis property that they purchased In 2021, they announced that they purchased a second property next door to the first one. So... yeah. Now... all of the organizations that I just mentioned, none of them not one is up to date on filing a tax return with the IRS which is required which is required for charities. Because charities remember, they don't pay taxes. In other words, I'm not able to tell you how any of these transgender organizations spent the money that BLM poured into the organizations during the 2020 and 2021 tax year If you continue to look through BLM IRS docs, you'll notice that they gave millions of dollars to various Black Lives Matter organizations throughout America. Or at least at first glance, it appears that they did. A closer look, you'll see that they actually dispersed that funding to organizations that were in care of Black Lives Matter This means that actually another organization is accepting the donation on behalf of BLM So I decided to investigate that further and I noticed a really and I noticed a really bizarre and I noticed a really bizarre pattern a lot of those organizations train activists They train the youth to become activists in their communities One organization even goes as far as bragging on their website about their history of getting arrested of getting arrested protesting and they offer courses on various techniques like Bird-dogging Thats a technique thats used to confront politicians I thought to myself, its interesting because I kept hearing over and over again while fliming this documentary that people felt as though the protestors had arrived throughout these cities weren't actually from the cities that they arrived in they didn't know where they had come from Buses, there was this idea that buses were showing up filled with protestors. Its a fair question then, is it plausible... that Patrisse was giving money to groups that were creating protestors? or training activists rather. I mean why else would Patrisse give millions of dollars to so many trained activists I wanted to investigate that piece a little further and so... I made some phone calls. So I wanna call some of these groups today pretend that I wanna give money to the organization and... see what I can find out about what they do Why do I get the feeling that none of these multi-million dollar organizations are gonna pick up the phone? How are you guys involved actively? Not just in "oh y'know..." We'd like to know how you're actually active This is great. Obviously we were... like I said we gave millions and millions of dollars after the horrific killing of George Floyd If we gave your organization a million dollars, and something like that happens... How are you getting involved? Thats so wonderful. Thats wonderful. Thats what we wanna see. Thats what we're looking for. You too, thank you so much. Training Training activists Making sure that people's minds are poisoned and that they know that they're supported through through bailing out "We will bail you out" "We've got the money to bail you out" and thats kind what this is all about the investigation continues And the organization that received the biggest grant from Black Lives Matter according to their filing is an organization called Living Through Giving Foundation The Living Through Giving Foundation per their mission statement 'strives to connect people through organized acts of love' they run a program called #HashtagLunchbag this program allegedly brings people together to create bagged lunches in which they write handwritten love notes and then they distribute the bagged lunches to local communities that sounds nice right? I thought so too. I thought to myself I want to attend one of these events but when I went to their website, there were no upcoming events. And when I went to the website to explore past events and learn more about the original givers I was met with a 'Coming Soon' page So I wondered who is the executive director of this organization that accepted 2. 2.3 2.3 million dollars from Black Lives Matter Global Foundation Of course when I went to the IRS website they also had neglected to file an up to date return but there was a name at least and that name was Ajay Relan listed as the executive director Ajay owns 3 coffee shops in California You'd have to imagine my surprise though when I found an article about his coffee shop opening in 2019 and buried within the piece was a picture of none other than Patrisse Cullors sitting there with her friends having coffee in 2019. Meaning, Patrisse Cullors had a relationship with Ajay Relan that predates the George Floyd protests So... exactly why did she transfer BLM money to her old friend Ajay via his charity that is nothing more than really a splash page with no upcoming events Is she a part owner of those coffee shops? Is she an investor? I will leave that as the '2.3 million dollar' question What I can say for certain is that you don't just send your non-black friend 2.3 million dollars just because Perhaps most hilariously, you'll recall that the founders of Black Lives Matter pride themselves on being abolitionists They want to "abolish the old systems of white supremacy" "the systems which keep black america away from garnering our true..." "generational wealth and financial freedom in this horrible country" which makes it somewhat odd that they invested $32,000,000 into the stock market Wall Street what a great way to abolish the system of white supremacy invest in stocks I think that the IRS docs in the end... lead to more questions than they do answers and if you were an individual who gave to this organization a well meaning individual who gave because you thought it was going to help black america Then... you should get answers to those questions. So we're headed to Laurel Canyon we've yet to see any black people in this neighbourhood there were a ton of cyclists coming through not that thats an issue but it just seems a bit strange because the Black Lives Matter messenging has been that black people cannot be safe in white spaces So its a unusual decision to buy a home in a neighbourhood that doesn't have any black faces and is surrounded by... what we've been told are violent white people that don't want to see black americans become better So... hopefully as we're heading now to the house we'll be able to speak to somebody speak to somebody on the property. Is this a creative space for black americans? Why did we purchase this property with the money that was raised on on the faces of so many dead black people? I'm assuming it's going to be a welcoming enviroment We'll see So theres definately somebody home Hello! I was just looking to speak to whoever is at this property Sir? Hello? I don't know if he's going to get someone... I see a very cute German Shepard. It looks like... This morning I woke up to Candace Owens being outside of my house with a news crew Looks to be... maybe in his mid-forties white male black hat and he is... whoever he's spoken to on the phone has instructed... has instructed him to record us which is strange because we just wanna talk. And what I see in the driveway... are... two cars. and a sign that says 'You are exactly where you are supposed to be' She She was She was demanding that I... come outside Hi! Hello! Hi, you're welcome to record I just wanna talk. Are you instructed not to speak to anybody? We're not trying to harass you, we'll gladly leave We're just wondering if we can speak to anybody? Sorry, what was that? Okay, I just thought this was a house for Black Lives Matter Its unacceptable and its dangerous that... anybody, any stranger come outside of my house We're just trying to figure if this house is actually being used for black people in a creative space at all. And it doesn't seem that way What happened this morning is not safety Its not... what I deserve its not what any of us deserve I can't see how this purchase helped black lives anywhere in America I can't even... find a black life on the property the dog's not even black so.. that's that. And so they're literally trying to destroy us they're trying to destroy... they're trying to destroy...me they're trying to destroy the movement and I really--I just need us to be stronger Thank you sir! Have a great day! What could be more emblematic of Black Lives Matter than that? Playing the victim to the public hoping that you can get sympathy and perhaps that sympathy will transform into dollars And of course, after we exposed that lie she subsequently wipes her Instagram And says that she needs a mental break and needs to reevaluate stuff And what I'm hoping is that by the end of this... they'll wipe the entire organization and charity y'kknow because it is not what it seems The real story is a story of addiction Thats it Thats actually a story that could've brought people together globally This was a man This was a man that was high on drugs and went into a store with counterfeit bills He sat in a car with his dealer obviously they had drugs on them drugs were found on them And I believe that in his final moments, when the police arrived he ingested a lethal amount of drugs And... unfortunately... the paramedics and the medical attention that this person would have needed in the immediate never happened, never transpired And... it is a story of a man who overdosed in the end The media The media is your enemy That is what I will say and I believe that from the bottom of my heart After examining every corner of this case The media The media scared The media scared the jury The media The media scared The media scared even politicians into agreeing in lockstep There is no other to examine the media but to recognize that they were the enemy And they're not going to stop being the enemy People were deluded and people were lied to and... people should be angry People should be rightfully angry that... they acted the part of a marketing agency for... what in my opinion is a complete fraud a fraudulent organization that uses black emotion and black pain to extort dollars from white america Thats what happened You were all lied to, thats the truth
