For some of US, all things but for the war had become a dim memory. Home was some distant star no closer than the sun or moon. Each man dreamed of that distant star, of all things familiar and good, of fighting no more battles. But for some of US, maybe all of US, going home would only mean the end of one war and the beginning of another. We fought together, but we'd go home alone. ♪ Till then ♪ di-oh ♪ my darling, please wait for me ♪ ♪ till then ♪ di-oh ♪ no matter when it will be ♪ ♪ one day ♪ I know I'll be back again ♪ ♪ please wait ♪ till then ♪ our dreams ♪ di-oh ♪ will live though we are apart ♪ ♪ our love ♪ di-oh ♪ I know will keep in our hearts ♪ ♪ till then ♪ when all the world will be free ♪ ♪ please wait ♪ for me ♪ although there are oceans we must cross ♪ ♪ and mountains that we must climb ♪ ♪ I know every game must have a loss ♪ ♪ so pray that our loss ♪ is nothing but time ♪ till then ♪ di-oh ♪ let's dream of what there will be ♪ ♪ till then ♪ di-oh ♪ we'll call on each memory ♪ ♪ till then ♪ when I will hold you again ♪ ♪ please wait ♪ till then Well? It's exactly the same. There are a few touches here and there, but I wanted it to be just the way you remembered. You must be exhausted. I had 14 days to get home. By ship, then by train... They were in a much bigger rush to get US to the war than from it. I was so proud when you stepped off that train, George. The uniform, you know... It does the trick. Maybe I should wear it in court. You'd never lose a case. I'll bet you're dying for a Martini, very, very dry. Actually, I lost my taste for gin. Martinis, they're not too big an item on the front. Whose idea was the parade? Oh, our beloved mayor cantrell. In cahoots with your father, I think. Nothing's too good for major George Meade. Cantrell. He was always happiest waving at people from a moving car. Where's the rest of this picture? The rest of what? This picture. There were five other men. I only wanted to look at you. I wish you hadn't done that. I'm sorry, George. I--i didn't know. Ah, it's all right. It's all right. Forget it. Well, I've been waiting four years to get out of this uniform. So I'm going to, uh... I'll be right back down. Thanks a lot. Take care. [Speaking Spanish] [Speaking Spanish] Mi hijo. Hey! Hey! Welcome home. How do I look? You're fine. Fine? He means beautiful. Now, look, don't everybody crowd in on him. He might be shy 'cause of his wound. He might not say much. Act like y'all don't notice. Want US to go? No! I want him to see friends. [Horn blows] Must you, Andy? It's my way of saying welcome home. Give me that thing. Sam, daddy's going to be real surprised seeing you all grown up. Just give him a big hug, and everything will be fine. Hey, hey! I made it! I'm back. What are y'all standing there for? Come on, get me up. Come on! Well, they were wrong about the shy part. Mama. Jesse, boy. Welcome home, Jesse. There she is. You look prettier than the day I left. Who's this big fella? Huh? Where's my little boy? Now? I'm home. They were beautiful. All of the ruined cities-- salerno, remagen, all of France. The world is an unbelievable place, even with the bombs dropping. You have fought bravely, and now you're at home where you belong. You've made me very proud. I thought about you, papa, every day. You'd have loved to have seen what I've seen, be where I've been. This is a very small place compared to what's out there. You will marry Maria. If she didn't forget me. Oh, she didn't. Going to be different now, papa. I can feel it. I fought side by side with men who wouldn't give me the time of day as a civilian. They depended on me, and I depended on them. This war, it brought everybody together. You'll see. There is no more war. Oh... I haven't slept in three days. Good night, papa. Well, you're doing fine, Jesse. And you're still going to be feeling confused. Might be some minor speech difficulty, but overall, everything looks good. When will he walk? It's hard to tell with head wounds. Brain has to relearn the messages it sends to the legs. Takes time. Keep doing those exercises. Slowly but surely, you'll start to walk again. How you holding up, Becky? Me? Yes, you. I'm fine. I'm a little tired. A big adjustment, returning from war. Harder for some than others. My daughter's been working with some veterans. If you need anything, even just to talk. That's why she's here, o.K.? Hey, George. Jesse. I heard you were back. Hello, Becky. Hope. Welcome home, George. We made it, huh? Or we're dead and nobody told US. How you feeling? I'm fine, just fine. You hear Johnny dynamite's back? Bronze star and all. Everybody will be at the blue moon Thursday night. Well, so will I. In fact, there's something I want to talk to you about. We better get going, Jesse. So, I'll see you Thursday night? 2100? You can be there at 2100. I'm going to be there at 9:00. Good to see you. You look great. Bye-bye. Will he be all right? It's hard to tell with head wounds. My father thinks he'll be o.K. It'll take some time. He still likes to talk, doesn't he? We always said he was vaccinated with a phonograph needle. I'm happy to see you, George. I'm busy, though. I just need a minute. It's important. All right, come on. Last time I saw you, you were planting that garden. You didn't see me. I was on a bus on my way to basic. Well, that garden's long gone. They tell me you're doing good work here. Well, after staring at the ceiling for a couple of months, I realized that wasn't going to bring Tim back. I went back to school. Got my degree-- psychology. Figured there'd be plenty to do when the boys got back. So daddy takes care of their bodies, and I try to take care of their minds. So far, he has a much higher success rate. I just wanted you to know how sorry I am about Tim. I was going to write a letter. That's all right, George. I really didn't know what to say. Widows aren't much in fashion this time of year. After all, we won the war, the boys are coming home... Guess it's much easier to watch a parade. People don't really want to think about all those wives and children that don't feel much like celebrating. Well, I'm sorry, hope. If there's anything I can do... Why'd you come here, George? What is it you wanted to say to me? I was with Tim when he died. It happened right in front of me. It was so--so quick. I held him, and... And he died in my arms. Did he suffer, George? Tell me the truth. I don't think he really felt anything. Except maybe cold. He told me he was cold. And then he asked me to come see you, tell you that he loved you. He wanted you to know that he was thinking of you when he died. Human beings have an amazing capacity for pain, George. Did you know that? Good thing, because just about when you think you've had all you can take, there's plenty more to come. I'm sorry, hope. I have to say I was surprised when you and Tim became friends during the war. You were such opposites in school. Tim was going to change the world. And you were going to own it. That seems like such a long time ago. He was a good man, hope... And a good friend. But you don't need me to tell you that. Like I said, anything I can do... George. Did Tim say anything else? He looked up at me... And he said, "don't look so scared, George. "You're dead already anyway. "You've been dead ever since law school. You just don't know it." [Loud machine noise] Well, you got this place humming, that's for sure. I've never seen it so organized. Brand-new lathe. Yeah, well, we did pretty good last year. It seemed like a smart idea to put some money back into the business. I would have asked you about it, Jess. Well, I wasn't exactly right around the corner, now, was I? Are you all right? Fine. I don't know why I expected it to be the same. Four years is a long time. That's what I hear. I'm sorry, Jess. I didn't mean for it-- that's all right. What's this? Uh, we got a contract with the air force base. Steering linkage for the c-4. I can see that, but what's this 5% over cost on every 5,000? Hmm? The mayor. It comes out of our profits. You mean cantrell's taking a payoff from US on a military contract? He brought US the job, Jesse. I can't believe it. Whew. It's one thing to pay him off to stay in business. I mean, everybody's used to that, but to skim... On a war contract. He's got this whole system worked out. Yeah? I'll bet he does. Business tax, he calls it. Everything else has a luxury tax. Everybody's got to live with it. It ain't just US. It's just not right! Someday I'm going to tax him up... I'll tax him... Right where it hurts. I'll say this much for Truman. He doesn't trust the Russians the way Roosevelt did. He understands they're up to no good. They were good enough to fight with US. Stalin's going to try to take over the world. Our next war will be with the Russians. U.n. Says there won't be any more wars. You believe that, George? No. Of course not. It's human nature. As long as there are things people want they can't have, there will be war. Here's to this war being over. Hear, hear. George... How does it feel working with your father again? Like being back in battle, only quieter. George is the best lawyer I've got. I'm not sure I like you stealing him, Tom. Obviously I've missed something here. We've been talking while you've been gone about the future of this county. About your future, too. I have the highest regard for your father, George, as you know, and we both agree you possess certain qualities, qualities that should not go to waste. Such as? I think you're a man of vision, George. You have an ability to see the big picture. You're a born leader. Election's coming up next month. Tom's offering you a spot on the ticket. County trustee. Bill Carlson is retiring on my advice. We need a fighting man the veteran can look up to. We need new blood. I'm not a fighting man anymore, Tom. My biggest ambition now is to lay down a lot. It's hard to look up to somebody taking a nap. I'm serious. This has been in the cards for you. You can't deny your destiny. It's not that I don't appreciate the offer, because I do. I don't need an answer now. You think about it. Talk it over with that beautiful wife of yours. But remember this, George. Your time has come. It's been going on since we were kids. Ever since that greedy been mayor, he's bled this county dry. He gets a piece of every contract. You bid to build the road, put cantrell down for 10%. He taxes every bottle of beer I open and every case of liquor. I pay him on every gallon of gas I sell. Cantrell keeps clean. Sheriff mcmillan does his collecting. If you don't like it, mcmillan will bust your head. We didn't take this from the Nazis. Why come home and take it from cantrell? That's right. Right, George? You're right, sure. But it's been going on a long time. People are used to it. Besides, cantrell has his good points as far as the town's concerned. He brings a lot of work into this county. He takes care of the people that take care of him. Whose side are you on? Since when are there sides? Since now. An election's coming up. Nobody serious has opposed cantrell. We're going to change that. We'll form our own party, not democrat, not republican, but veteran. We'll get the vets together and run for--for... You all right? It's nothing. Like I'm saying, we'll run...Jack for sheriff, bill for county clerk, and Johnny for trustee. Straight bet right down the line! A Mexican trustee? I think you've gone crazy, Jesse. Don't laugh. It's the best chance you've got. It's the best chance we all got. How about it, George? Oh, it's... It's a good idea, all right. But it will never work. Cantrell's too powerful and experienced. I'm sorry to hear you say that. I was hoping you'd head up the ticket for US-- run for mayor. We'd be unbeatable with you, George. Wait a minute. Now, I'm flattered, Jess. I really am. I wish I could help. I'm talking about helping the county. You're assuming the county wants to be helped. People are as fed up as we are. Maybe they don't know it, but they are. This is a good fairy tale, but it's late, and I've got to go. You won't make history. You're going to miss out. The only thing I want to make is money. Hasta luego, amigos. Last chance, George. I'm sorry, Jess. I'm just not interested. This is what we've been waiting for, George. This is your chance. You have greatness in you. I see it. Your father sees it. Tom cantrell sees it. You're the only one who doesn't. I don't know what's right anymore. That's what you have me for, darling. Do you remember hope Tyler's husband? The poor man who got killed. Yes, of course. I was with him when he died. He said something to me, something I can't get out of my head. He told me that-- shh... You've got to stop dwelling on the past, George. It's time to put the war behind you. Think about US. Think about our future. Oh. Run with cantrell, darling. This is only the beginning. All we have to do is take that first leap. We're ready for this. We deserve this. [Applause] [Singing in Spanish] [Applause] [Whistling] [Whistling] Look at Juan. Like a big kid, huh? That's one big kid I'll take on my side every time. Best dynamite man I've ever seen. He's the only dynamite man you've ever seen. Who dialed your number? Andy, let's hear that bunker routine again. Achtung, der luftwaffe! Ze Americans dropped bombs left und right. The fuhrer says damage is slight. However, as a result of zis mission... One of our cities is missing. Hey, George, remember the night your sleeping bag caught on fire? I thought my feet were finally getting warm. Nobody told me I was on fire. It's a beautiful wedding, isn't it? Yes, it is. Sometimes it's a good idea to get away from the men. They like to talk amongst themselves. As long as they stay out of trouble. I wouldn't worry about that. They talk big, but they're essentially harmless, like a school of fish or a flock of birds. Miss Meade, can I ask you a question, personally? It's Barbara. Certainly. Does George act funny since he's been back? I'm sorry, I don't mean funny, not like that. What I mean is, do you think he... Is there anything different about him? For instance, Jesse, well, he doesn't know how to talk to me anymore, and I don't know if... My husband is perfectly fine. Excuse me. So we're going to register for the election next week. Can't believe how much paperwork there is. I envy you, Jesse. You're a man who knows what he wants. How about you, George? What do you want? I wish I knew. Well, you missed your chance to run with US. We got a new candidate for mayor. Who? Me. I'm trying real hard, hope. I swear I am. Oh, and I don't know if I'm doing right or not. Jesse? He gets these spells. He can't remember how to do certain things, and sometimes his voice gets stuck. He just goes wild. He scares the boy half to death. Me, too. Does he try to hurt you? No, no. Mostly, he just hurts himself. Jesse's going to get better. It's just a matter of time. He wants me to quit working. What do you think? Hope, I love running that factory. And I had a real knack for it, too. We're making more money now than we did when Jesse ran it. Have you tried talking to him about it? It's not as easy as it used to be. He doesn't want to talk anymore. He didn't even talk to me about running for mayor. He just decided himself. It's crazy. Have you thought about encouraging him? He's doing something he believes in. Encourage him? Hope, he's got no chance. Let's face it. No, the whole thing is just plain foolish. Not to him. I better get on back. Thanks for the time, though. I wish I had the answers for you, Becky. It's just nice to have someone listen. Becky. You're taking care of a lot things right now. Don't forget to take care of yourself. You ever want somebody to talk to, day or night, you know where I am. You take such good care of everybody, hope. Who takes care of you? Hello, sir. What can I do for you, son? My name is Juan Medina. I came about the job-- office clerk. I see. Well, have a seat there, Mr. Medina. Thank you. Oh, um, these are my discharge papers. Honorable discharge. Mm-hmm. They really give you the bronze star, son? Yes, sir. It's right here. [Telephone rings] So they did. Well, uh, what would you say your qualifications are, Mr. Medina? Very hard worker. Do you know anything about the insurance business? I learn fast. I learned very fast in the service. I had special training. What kind of special training? Munitions, explosives... Ahem. We don't have occasion to blow up too much around here, but if we do, we'll know who to call. The ad says no experience. I'm sorry, son, I just don't think it's going to work out. Look, uh, I tell you what. If you really need a job, son, I can always use somebody to sweep up around here. If you want to, come on back just before closing. I'd like to help him out, but what could he do here? I was thinking maybe file clerk. Tom cantrell's nephew is our file clerk. You mean the kid that sits around all day. You're good lawyer, George, but since when did you get so friendly with the Mexicans? Dad, I trust my life with this man. We'd be lucky to have him. Don't be naive, George. He doesn't have the right qualifications. You understand what I'm saying. Loud and clear. Your heart's in the right place, son. Bring me the malinson file, would you? I'm sorry, Johnny. That's o.K. I understand, George. Well, it's, you know, there's just no openings. It's a small company. It's o.K. Thanks for trying. You know, if things are tight, I can spot you some dough. Oh, no, nothing like that. I'm fine. No, thank you. Just keep it in mind. You don't have to worry about me. You ever miss the war, George? The truth? A little bit, yeah. Me, too. George. You better hurry. We're going to be late. Late for what? Oh, don't tease me, darling. The carlsons' dinner party. It's been on the calendar for weeks. I don't feel well. You'll feel better after a nice dinner. I'm not in the mood for a party. You haven't been in the mood for anything. Snap out of it. The war's over. How easy. Why didn't I think of that? Don't be sarcastic. It doesn't suit you. I don't want to sit at another party where everyone wants to hear war stories I'm trying to forget. Very unlike a candidate. Well, I'm not yet, am I? Ronny bishop called today from the ovington observer. Wanted to know if the rumor was true you're running with cantrell. Must be a slow news day. I told him you were. You did what? It doesn't hurt to get a little press. Let cantrell know people are interested in you. Barbara, I haven't told anyone I'm running. I haven't even told anyone I'm strolling yet. My advice to you is you call Ronny what's-his-name and tell him you're mistaken. George, you know you're going to run. You're going to run because it's the right thing to do. You better shave, darling. Oil's o.K. That will be 2.35, sir. Here. Thank you. [Dog barking] Oh, there are the neighbors! Hello, Mr. Jones! Yes, I do have the most beautiful house on the block. Thank you. My car? It's just something I use to get around in. A car like this, it's just wasted on rich people. You know why? No. Why? 'Cause everything they have is this good, so they don't even notice anymore. I haven't even got a chair as comfortable as these seats. I'd always notice. Someday we'll have a car like this. You know? A car you can't hear coming from five blocks away? I know. Hmm. I'll be right back. Howdy. Fill it. [Ding] You're that kid they gave that bronze star to, right? That's right. So I'm getting my... My gas pumped by a genuine hero. I like that. [Ding] Andy! It's going to be 85 cents. Where's Andy? Oh, he had to leave early. And left you in charge? Uh-huh. It will be 85 cents for the gas. You didn't need much. Whoa, son. Relax. You're working too hard. You know what the problem is with your people from Mexico way? They think the world owes them a living. That's why I like to see a hard-working Mexican like you. You talk good. These others don't talk good English. Maybe someday I'll give you lessons. O.k., son, where is it? What do you mean? What? Envelope with my name on it. Where did your boss leave it? I don't know what you're talking about. Andy will be back in the morning. I really do need that 85 cents for gas. You got it all wrong, son. I don't pay you, you pay me. Now, where's my envelope? I haven't seen any envelope. Maybe, uh, just maybe... You put it in your own pocket. Look, I told you I don't know what you're talking about. [Crashing] Juan! Juan! Stop it! Stop it! Damn it! How could he do this to US? He's turned his back on the whole town. People like George stick with their own kind. This doesn't change anything. Still going to run. Kick their butts. Who's going to vote for US with George running against US? I don't want to hear that. Our flyers are printed. We'll hit the streets tomorrow. I got to lock up. Anybody finds out I let you in here-- [wheels rolling] You can count me in, amigos. Well, you got to give the poor fella credit. He's got the courage of his convictions. Veterans party, bipartisan-- the man has some imagination, don't you think, George? Now, what do you suppose he's after? What do you think he really wants out of all this? I think he wants to do the right thing. Now I really feel sorry for him. Cigar, George? No, thank you. Is there anything else we need to go over? No, it's all clear. Aw, cheer up, son. There's nothing to it. We'll make a couple of speeches, show up at some fund-raising dinners for our beloved governor, and play 18 holes on election day. It's that easy. It's a blessing. People know what's right. Who also know what's wrong. Afraid I don't follow you there, George. You know what I'm talking about, don't you? No idea. You paid a visit to Juan Medina yesterday. Ended up beating him half to death. Little misunderstanding over a payoff, I'm told. What's this all about, sheriff? Beats me. I never touched him. George... George, I think this election is getting you all jittery. Why don't you relax for a few days? I've got everything under control. Yeah, you treat this county like it's your own little dictatorship, Tom. How long do you think people are going to stand for that? I wouldn't be so quick to judge, son. Remember, we're all in this together. Besides, everybody's a little tainted one way or another. [Door closes] Born politician. What do you want me to do about meadows? Do? Why? What is there to do? Let the boy run. As a matter of fact, I'll give him the chance to go head to head with me--public debate. That's going to look like you take him serious. No. It's going to make it look like I have nothing to fear. Besides, as I understand it, this boy left half his brain on some battlefield. We'll get him in front of the people and let them see exactly what kind of man wants to be their mayor. Just set it down. Thank you. Ahem. You think this is all a big joke, don't you? I never said that. You don't have to. It's all over your face every time you look at me. I'm just afraid you're taking on too much too soon. You're worrying I'll make a fool of myself. Don't start this again. If you feel this is what you have to do, then do it. Well, maybe it would be a little easier if I thought you were behind me. I am. I don't understand what you want. Yes, you do. I'm going to ask you again. Quit the factory and work with me on this. I need you. I can get men to run that factory just as good as you. Oh, is that right? Why don't you get those men to run this election? Because I need my wife. How do you think it looks when you're never around? People don't think you take it serious. This has nothing to do with the election. You don't like me running that factory by myself. You want me waiting on you. That's a lie. How come you didn't need me when you cooked up your veterans party? You didn't bother talking to me about it. You made me feel I wasn't part of things anymore, and that hurt, Jesse. That hurt? Well, how do you think it feels to come home and see your wife doing your job for you? That you don't fit in no more? That was in your mind. I never tried to make you feel that way. I wanted you to come back to the factory. I didn't tell you to run for mayor. Is that right? Well I'll tell you what... I'll drop out of the race, take the factory over again, and you could stay home with Sam. How would that be? I'll call Juan right now. Jesse! You don't want that, do you? You don't want me back there. It's not like that. It's just that I've been running it for a long time, and I've done good with it, real good. I never dreamed I could run a business. It feels good to use my brain. Maybe it makes me like myself more, but it doesn't mean I love you less. You can't ask me to go back to the way things were, Jesse. Well, you better figure out what's more important to you-- your job or your husband. How come I'm the one that has to decide? Maybe you better figure out what's more important to you-- the election or your wife. I'll be the one to give out jobs, take bids on county work. I'll make a very good salary-- move out of this place, get a house in town. What do you think, huh? What about your job? I'll quit. This campaign is my job now. I thought you'd be happy. For once we get a chance to take things into our own hands, to make the rules ourselves. What are you thinking? About my sister... The one in California. Her husband works on a farm. They are safe there. There are a lot of jobs. There's nothing to be afraid of. She has a lemon tree right outside her window. I'm not going to run away. You have to fight to change things. I'm afraid. Of what? Of what they will do to you. I say it's time for people to stop having to live in fear of our sheriff and his deputies. It's time for people to stop paying bribes just to keep their businesses open. I say it's time for a change. That time is now. Ladies and gentlemen, I have patiently listened while this young man has made his wild accusations... But I ask you, and I ask my opponent, where is the proof? There is no proof because sheriff mcmillan will bust your head if anybody comes forward. Sheriff mcmillan has made the streets of our town safe, safe, and this is the thanks he gets for it. Safe unless you refuse to pay Tom cantrell, safe unless you're a Mexican, safe unless he don't like your skin color. All right, I think you've made yourself abundantly clear as to how you feel about what is wrong. I'd like to hear how you'd make it right. Mr. Meadows, what are your plans for running our city? Well, I got a lot of ideas. I... How do you propose to raise money for the sewage system that we need? There's a lot of ways to raise that money. Well, we're all ears. Well, I haven't firmed up... I haven't firmed up the best way yet. I haven't firmed that up yet. I see. Well, what about property taxes? I can guarantee the people of this town don't want to pay one more penny in property taxes, but they want a brand-new grade school. How do you propose to solve that problem? No, the answers are not in those papers, Mr. Meadows. You don't know the answers. Being the mayor is more than pointing fingers and making accusations. You have got to have the experience... And you have got to have the brains. All I need is a fair chance. That's more than you've given US... But I can run this town. I can run this town... Just as... Just... As... Just as... You were saying? Just... [Thunder] [Telephone rings] [Ring] Hello? George, it's Becky meadows. What is it? What's the matter? It's Jesse. I need help, George. He's got a gun. I'll be right there. Ooh! Jesse, please, come inside. Get away from me! Just leave me alone! Jesse, I want to talk to you for a minute. Jesse. I just want everything to go away. No! Jesse! If you hurt yourself, you'll hurt Becky and Sam, too. Is that what you want? I want you to leave. I don't want nothing from you. It's none of your business, hope. Why can't everybody just leave me alone? Just leave me alone! What about Becky? Have you talked to her? Talk to Becky. You get out of... Get out of here, George. You're a traitor. I don't want nothing to do with you, George Meade. Give me that gun, Jesse. I just as soon shoot you as shoot myself, George. Now, you get away! Give me that gun. George, please. Come on, Jess, you can't let it end this way. Let me do it, George. I just want to do it. I can't stand it anymore, George. I...i can't think straight. I can't talk straight. I don't want to be like this. I want everything to be the way it used to be, George. I want it all. I want it all back. We all want it back. You think I don't? You think I wouldn't trade everything just to have my life back the way it was before? I don't know where I belong anymore, George. I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. I don't... I don't know. I don't know. Neither do I. Nobody understands... What all it was, George. That's why we got to stick together. We can't quit. Then why did you turn your back on US, George? We needed you. That should have been you up there today, not me. Why didn't you stick with US? Why? George, don't you know that's where you belong? I'm sorry, Jess. I just got lost. I swear. I'm just lost, that's all. This is the part the politicians never tell you about. They're big on glory and victory and medals, all so we don't mind when some of the boys don't come home in one piece or don't come home at all. There's an even better medal for that one. It'd be nice if it was that simple, hope. But things are a little more complicated than that. Believe me when you see what I see, it is that simple. I guess everybody needs something to believe in. What do you believe in, George, Tom cantrell? What's that supposed to mean? How can you throw in with cantrell? You know who he is. He's no better or worse than any other politician. I don't believe you're that naive or cynical. Cantrell knows people in this town look up to you. He's using you to give him the one thing he cannot buy-- respectability. I never asked anybody to look up to me. You want to know what I believe in? Maybe I don't believe in anything anymore. Anymore? When did you ever believe in anything? You've always been your father's errand boy. Now you're going to be cantrell's. Who the hell are you to judge me? You think you got all the answers. You know what your problem is? You're too idealistic. It certainly never was your problem. I always saw things for what they were. You saw things for what they should be. That's exactly right. That's why I married Tim. Tim was right about you, George. You are dead. [Car starts and drives away] George, are you all right? I want you to call Jesse. Have him get everybody together and meet me at the armory tomorrow, 11:00. I want hope Tyler there, too. What do I tell him? Just do it! You said I walked out on you, I let you down. And you're right. For a long time I didn't really know where I belonged. Now I know. If the offer still stands, I'd like to run for mayor... Of the veterans party. We're only going to have one chance. We've got to make it count. It's going to mean hitting the streets, knocking on doors. It'll take every minute until the election. We've got to take this message to everybody in this county. If everyone who's complaining about cantrell votes for US, he won't have a chance. If they don't, they deserve him. Was it the war that made you so self-destructive or just plain stupid? I'm sorry it embarrasses you. You have embarrassed yourself. You could've ridden cantrell's coattails right to the capitol. No, you threw in with losers to shake everybody up. They won the war for you. I am warning you George. You're taking on the wrong man. If you lose, and you will, your name won't be worth a good spit. You'll have to start over elsewhere. Tom cantrell has a very long reach. Tom cantrell's time is up. He'd better face it, and you better face it. There's something else you should keep in mind. You've got less than 30 days to mount a campaign. You'll need a miracle, and that doesn't come cheap. You'll have to look to a lot of people for favors. If the miracle should happen, don't think they won't collect. You've got to give to get in this business. In a year, or maybe two, you'll be doing the same things you hate cantrell for now. It's the nature of the beast, George. Have I failed you in some way? Is this some childish rebellion? I know this may come as a shock, but this has nothing to do with you. Then tell me what it does have to do with. You wouldn't understand. Don't condescend to me, George. I don't deserve that. Barbara, all my life I've let other people call the shots. I can't do it anymore. I won't. By other people, you mean me. I mean my father, cantrell, and yes, I mean you. So I'm to blame for you throwing away your political career? Would you listen to me? For once, listen! It has nothing to do with blame. If you want to blame someone, blame me. I let it happen. I never took responsibility. But now I am. Now I have to. What about your responsibility to me? I invested my whole life in you. You needed someone to push you. If it wasn't for me, you'd have been content to drift into nothingness. You owe me. Barbara... I am drifting. That's all I've ever done. Except for during the war when I stood for something. I fought for what I believed in, and it felt good. Then I came home, and you wanted everything to be just like it was, like I'd never left. And I tried. Really, Barbara, I tried, but... But that's all gone now. I need to find something that I can believe in again. Now I have a chance here to do something good, something that can really make a difference. And I'm going to take it. Why didn't you ever tell me you felt this way? I tried... But you were too busy planning my future to hear me. All right, George. You've made yourself clear. You've chosen your course. I won't stand in your way. But I want you to know I have no intention of letting you drag me down with you. I won't be married to a loser. There's a price for everything, George. Maybe you should think about that. If we fought for democracy on the battlefields of Europe and in the pacific, why can't we have it in our own town? Because Tom cantrell won't let US, that's why. On election day I want you to say no to the cantrell machine. We must have the courage to believe in ourselves, to believe that we can make a difference, that our vote does count. And believe this... Every vote for the veterans party is a vote for yourselves! Gotten a little rusty, Henry. Yeah, well, I don't get to play much anymore. Things busy at the office? It's been a good year. Glad to hear it. You know, uh... I like to think I've had a hand in helping your firm along. Yes, Tom, you've been good to US. Happy to do it. Happy to do it. Of course, I don't think I have to tell you how disappointed I am in George. No, you don't. He has said some very distressing things-- slanderous, really. I was hoping you might have a word with him, see if he would tone down his rhetoric. Don't tell me you're getting nervous. A good politician's always nervous. Of course, George is going to lose, but there's no point in putting ideas in people's heads, make them restless. What makes you so sure he's going to lose? The Mexican. The Mexican. Nobody's going to vote for the veterans party while a Mexican's on the ballot. Not in this town. Not any town I know. Am I wrong? No. You're exactly right. Henry, why don't you tell George that he's made his point? After the election's over, I'd be more than willing to sit down and discuss his beloved veterans, see what I can do. He'll come out of this smelling like a Rose. But for now, he's got to stop slinging mud and behave like a gentleman. I can't get through to him anymore than you. He's changed. He's his own man now. Well, you're his father, Henry. I'm depending on you. What's it say? If the election were held today, it would still be cantrell by 2 to 1. How about the phones? Lots of support, lots of good lucks, but very few committing either way. Well, time for more radio. [Knock on door] You might as well know, I'm supposed to be here to call you off. Cantrell. He wants to make a deal. Stop exposing him for the thief he is, he'll take care of the veterans after the election. I'm sure if you press him, he'll even suspend the business licensing requirements, maybe even some taxes. You mean the bribes. All this is assuming that I lose. It's a pretty safe assumption. You know that. But I don't understand. Everywhere we go, people cheer US. It'll take more than a few hundred veterans to turn the tide. It'll take more than a few hundred veterans will he keep his word? He will. I don't know. What do you think, dad? The truth? A few weeks ago I would've told you to make the deal, but everything's changing, George. The town's changed. You've changed. I don't know what surprises me more-- that you made a believer of me or of yourself. Either way it scares me. I'm too old to have everything shifting, but even I can see cantrell's got to go. He's out of control. He's gone too far. We were friends, you know... Ever since we were children. That's a long time ago. George, you really want to win this election? Of course I do. You know I do. Are you willing to do what it takes-- be ruthless? Well, I don't under-- what are you talking about? You've got to take Juan Medina off the ballot. Nobody's going to vote for a Mexican. The town's not ready for it. It's that simple. I won't. He's one of US. Is he worth losing the election for? We're not talking about right or wrong here. We're talking about reality. We're talking about politics. With him, you lose. Without him, you've got a chance. It's up to you, George. I can't believe what I'm hearing. Let's take a look at this. Take a look at what? Johnny won a bronze star. The man's a hero. We know Johnny's the best. We're talking about something bigger. We're talking about the color of a man's skin. I don't like it either, but not many people will vote for US if Juan's on the ticket. Does anybody think I'm wrong? George is right. We have to think about this. We're taking a chance. I thought that was the whole point. We're here to make changes. You can't change people's attitudes overnight. How will those attitudes change? We have to take a chance. We're already trying the impossible. So what's best for the town, that we lose on principle or we compromise and win? That's not the point! If that's not it, what is? The point is we're supposed to be equals. We're supposed to stand for something better than cantrell. But what good will that do US if we lose? Walking out on US isn't going to make it go away. I can't sit here and be part of this. If we compromise this today, what will we compromise tomorrow? [Door closes] [Knock on door] Johnny... Why don't you come in? No, George. I can only stay a minute. Look, John-- the thing is, George, I hate to do this to you now, but I'll have to drop out of the race. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? Well... I'm thinking about it. Maybe I don't really want to stay here... This place, this town. Maybe it's time to move on. I'm sorry, George. I didn't mean to let you down. Now, look, Johnny. I don't know what you've heard, but you're not off the ticket. There's been a lot of talk-- it doesn't matter. I won't cost US the election, and I'm not going to wait to be kicked out. Either way, I lose. It's a relief, isn't it, George? It's not that way, Johnny. Yeah, well... Why don't you tell me someday what way it is, o.K., amigo? If we win, we'll make things change, Johnny. I promise that. Congratulations, George. You're a real politician now. There's nothing here for US anymore. No future. How can I have children here, in a place where a man can't get ahead? You have to live in your own world. This is where you come from, this is where you should stay. Out there is only pain for you. I can't. Papa, I can't. I'm not like you. The army showed me what's out there, what a man can be. I have seen what's out there. Here you have your family, people who understand you. Papa... I think I'm going to take Maria to California. We'll live like people there, not like animals. What makes you believe it'll be any different in California? It has to be. No, it doesn't. Stay for a little longer, Juan. I just got you back. O.k., papa. O.k. You seen the polls? Oh, yeah. And we're catching up. Some even have US slightly ahead. It's amazing what the sacrifice of a human being can do, isn't it? You want a drink? Tough week for you, George. It's lonely at the top. Here's to election day, a mere... A mere eight hours away. I guess I've been pretty tough on you, George. Somebody had to be. I wasn't up to it. I don't know. This whole thing with Juan... I knew you were in a tough spot, and I know there was no easy answer, but it all just makes me feel... Corrupted. Welcome to the club. You know, I can still see you in that garden. I don't know how many times I've thought about that. It was just a glance... But it stayed with me a long time. Get some sleep, George. You, too. You bet. Uh-huh. Mrs. Ferguson needs a ride in. She can't drive. We want to get her in so she can vote. Could you do that? Oh, that'd be-- that'd be great. We really appreciate it. This is all happening because of you. Nobody believed in you. You went ahead and did it anyway. You're a hero, Jesse. Don't forget that. Becky... Um... Um, I know I never said this to you, but... When I got shot, they told me I might lose my memories, so all I did was think about you and Sam and... Everything we've been through. I tried to remember every little thing in case I never remembered it again. It made me realize... We-- it made me realize how lucky I am. And... You got me through it... Whether you know it or not. And don't think I don't know you ran this factory better than I could. You kept everything going. And if anybody's a hero... It's you. So far... It's veterans party... Yes... 2 to 1! They're saying it's 2 to 1, veterans. Is it slowing down any? How's it looking? They're still lining up around the block to vote. Well, I think it's about time the polls were closed, don't you? Deputize everybody you can. Meet me at the post office. Let's go. These polls are officially closed! Everybody out! What are you doing? I'm warning everybody to leave these premises. The polls are closed. Like hell! These people came here to vote-- damn it, Curtis! Yeah? What? All right. Jack just got shot at the post office. Mcmillan's got an army there. They closed the polls. Hey, Billy, you got the keys to the armory? Let's go. Hold on. Stay out of this, George! You stay back! There's a man hurt in there. He needs help. I don't want to shoot you, George, but I will. We're taking what we came for and getting out of here. Ow! My back! O.k. It'll be all right. O.k., let's him get up. What are you waiting for? Get his legs! We're losing some blood. Let's go! Get his legs! All right. Come on! Tell cantrell he's gone too far this time, mcmillan. It's all your fault! You should've kept your mouth shut and minded your own business! What the hell we do now, George? Lets go. Don't move in until I tell you. We don't want anybody to get hurt. All right. George, what's going on? They took the ballot boxes. We're getting them back. With guns? If necessary, yes. George, we can't start a war. Slow down a minute. We can't really call the police. Call the governor. You're playing into cantrell's hands. The governor's on cantrell's side. We're out of time. They'll count the votes, he'll declare himself the winner. We can't let this happen, people are going to get hurt. Why does it always have to come down to a war? You want to know why, hope? Because some people can't be reasoned with. Who are you talking about, you or cantrell? You better put the governor on right now. Tell him it's Tom cantrell, and it's an emergency! How many of them are out there? Every 10 minutes, another farmer with a shotgun pulls up. Earl! Yeah, you better believe it's important. I've got renegade veterans with guns surrounding my jail. They're trying to steal the ballot boxes, that's what. I don't know how many. There's 100, maybe 200. I need some help, and I need it fast. Yes, Earl, I have men, but I don't have enough-- yeah. Yes, all right. You just hurry, understand? Someday we'll see how fast I move when your back's against the wall. Cover the window. What'd he say? He's going to mobilize the national guard. We'll have to sit tight and wait. Let's do what we came here to do. Open it up! Tom, this is George Meade! We want two of your deputies to come down, unarmed, with the ballot boxes, set them down in the middle of the street. We'll do an official count, then we can all go home. Now, if I don't see that ballot box come through that door in one minute, we're going to open fire. You got 60 seconds. 20! You're out of your mind, George, we're the law here, not you. The national guard's on its way-- who fired that shot? Jesse! Jesse! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Is anybody hit? This is crazy! Give them what they want! They're going to kill US! Shut up! Now, keep calm! They'll never get in this building. We're safe here till help comes. You heard them. The national guard will shoot first, ask questions later. We'll go to prison, if they don't kill US first. We got to get those ballot boxes before the guard comes. If we can do that, we can tell our side of the story. The whole town's our witness. So what are we going to do George? The brick's too solid. We can't shoot through. They can stay in there all night. We'll just have to blow it. Ready. We turned our backs on you, Johnny, let you walk away. Nobody would blame you for staying away. It's different when it's war. Yeah, but it shouldn't be. I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this to get rid of cantrell. I'm doing it because this is my town, too. Put your head down, amigo. [Coughing] Where is he? Where's cantrell? Gone. Where is he? I swear! He ran downstairs and out back after the explosion. Out. Get out! [Cheering] We didn't have any choice. Cantrell? Got away. Why don't I feel like we won? Maybe because we are tainted. That's what cantrell said. What? Nothing. George? Was it worth it? I hope so. Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
