[Coughing] Well, I'll speak to them about getting her into a private room. There's no point. She's gonna be out in a couple of days. What? They need to free up the beds. I can't take care of her, Roger. You know how stressful it is having her living with us already. She's gonna need help with everything. Going to the bathroom, bathing, going up and down the stairs. We'll move her downstairs to the den for a while. That's not the point. You know how busy I am with work. I am never home. Fine, we'll hire a nurse. The insurance should cover that. You're not listening to me. I'm sure Roger's right, he usually is in these matters. The insurance company is gonna cover all of the costs and your recovery is going to be a lot faster. Well, it'll certainly make your life easier. Oh, Helen, please, it's not a good moment to make a fuss. The important thing now is that I get back on my feet as soon as possible, you know, get back to normal. And if that means spending a few weeks in a nursing home, - then so be it. - I told you, Mother, it is not a nursing home. It's a very nice retirement home that happens to have facilities for seniors that are convalescent. There's nothing wrong with most of the people there. Except that they're all old.

Oh, my. What? What? You broke something? I didn't know that, that's terrible. No, no, no, I was telling her about Betty's accident. It was right outside the front door. They were bringing us back from the mall and as I was stepping out of the van my foot got caught on something and down I went. I couldn't walk for three months. I still get some pain there sometimes. That's your arthritis, it has nothing to do with the fall. What are you talking about? I never had arthritis until I broke it, that's when it started. You have arthritis in both feet.

And you better get used to the wheelchair too. I'm sorry, Mr... Shapiro. Isaac Shapiro. Call me Isaac. Mr. Shapiro, my doctor, Dr. Norris, he told me that I would be walking in a couple of weeks. And you believed him? Why wouldn't I? Because he's a doctor, that's why. Look at Carl Jones. Oh, he was a resident here for over six years. And in excellent health. And the doctors, they say, "Oh, you need a hip replacement," so they do the surgery and the next thing you know he's dead from a stroke. Oh, that's terrible. That must have just been bad luck. That sort of thing doesn't happen very often. It happens all the time. That's what's so dangerous about hospitals. You go in, chances are you won't be coming out. That's not really true. People go in and out of hospital all the time. And never trust what doctors say. They use us as guinea pigs because we're old and nobody will miss us. Oh, Isaac, that's no way to talk. Not talking to you, so don't-- [coughs] Well, see, that's because you're talking with your mouth full again. It's garbage! Don't let it bother you.

Even with the staff helping me, I managed to tear the hem on my skirt. Oh, don't worry, Isaac can help you with that. He was a tailor, he fixes all our clothes. He's a fabulous tailor. You'll fix it for her, won't you, Isaac? He's in the craft room every morning, and he's usually there from 3:00 until dinner time depending on how long the card game goes. Thank you, that's very kind of you. Read 'em and weep. [Laughter] What? Again. God... God! Oh, so, Isaac, when are you gonna tell us? What's she like? That new girl at your table. Katherine. Yeah, she's a real dish. What'd I tell you? Look, she's a nice girl. Why don't you try being a little nicer to her for a change. What's it gonna do, kill you?

I'm just saying she's a nice girl, she's good lookin', she's got a good head on her shoulders, and they are very nice shoulders. - Amen. - If I was like, what, maybe 10 years younger and I could walk, I would ask her to go dancing. 10 years ago you were married and you could walk and you never took your wife dancing. Marriage does that to a man. Yeah, right. Sarah. Sarah? Hey! What did you bring those for? Ugh, Mom sent them. She couldn't make it. She knows I don't like plants. I just wanted my opera music.

All right, so that's the play button. - Mm-hm. - And that's the volume control. - Okay. - And that's pretty much it. What? How come you never liked plants? Because you have to take care of them. I prefer cut flowers. When they die, you just throw 'em away. ♪ ♪ Were you always a tailor? When I was five years old, I learned to sew buttons. It was during the war. And when Hitler invaded Poland, my father took us to a village far from the border. He mended farmers' clothes for food and we survived like that for a couple of years. And then the Nazis found us, but he was such a good tailor that the officers made him their own personal tailor. That's when I learned to sew. He needed help. The needle and the thread saved my life. And then what did you do after the war? After the war? Life was pretty miserable under the Communists. So when they expelled the Jews in '68, I came here. I earned a good living. People always need clothes. I had my own shop for 30 years. Six workers at the end. I never wanted to retire. It's all I'd ever done. But... ...my hands, wore them out. Right. Yeah. All done then? Yeah. Oh. This won't bother you again. Oh, thank you, that was so quick. Thank you so much, Mr. Shapiro. This machine is garbage. Ah! Oh dear. Are you okay? Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Well, I'll, uh, see you later. [Groans] Ooh! Damn. [Sighs] One down. Can you believe this? He always falls asleep right in the middle of a conversation. Honestly.

I don't know why she comes down here pretending to smoke those stupid cigarettes. - Oh, Mr. Shapiro-- - Now a cigar, that's a real smoke. My son used to bring me a box of the finest Havanas - every year for my birthday. - Mr. Shapiro-- Then I come here and the doctors say, "Stop!" As if it makes any difference at my age. What the hell do they know? So I stop and I sit here. It's still not the same since Neil died. He used to smoke the finest Havanas. Isaac!

The look on his face was priceless. Anyone who's that grumpy must be really unhappy. Well, I did give him the plant. [Laughs] You should give him something nice, Grandma, something he'd like. Imagine if you had to spend the rest of your life here. I don't think you'd be very happy either. Well, I sure wouldn't. It's another big change from the life he had. He told me a bit about it today. It almost sounded like the plot from an opera, you know, so dramatic. Bigger than life. Bigger than my life anyway. How he survived the war. Came here, started a new life. But it was odd, too, the matter-of-fact way he spoke of it. Almost as if it was someone else he was talking about. See? Being in there has taken his life away. No wonder he's unhappy.

Every night after dinner he'd get up from the table, sit in his big wingback chair, put his feet on the leather ottoman, and light up. Yeah, I loved watching him. I must have, you know, been comforted by the ritual. And the smell, this takes me right back. Mm-hm, things sure have changed. My wife made me go outside. [Chuckles] I smoked cigars since I was 16 years old. In fact, when I had money, I bought the finest Cuban cigars, that was one of the few luxuries that you could still get in Poland. But she would nag me about smoking, it bothered her eyes. And she nagged me about my drinking too. About anything that gave me a little pleasure. She was very religious, so what can you expect? And I gather that you are not? No, I was too busy working. I mean, going to synagogue doesn't help. I mean, either He wants you or He doesn't want you. I lived a very honest life. I haven't broken too many Commandments. How long have you lived here? Almost three years. Three years. Do you... do you like it? It's not that bad. The only reason I complain about the food is, I miss my wife's cooking. She was a good cook. But other than that, I do a little sewing, I play some cards, I watch TV. What more can you ask at my age? A good cigar. I don't know what kind this is. There were so many brands. I think this might be Cuban. I was gonna get you some and then I thought I didn't know which ones you liked, so... ...now the next time my granddaughter comes to take me shopping, why don't you come with us? Then you could choose your own. Thank you. Okay. How does she sleep with all those things on her face? I guess she takes them out. Like teeth? Mr. Shapiro, this is Sarah. Sarah, Mr. Shapiro. Now, you ride in the front, I'm gonna sit in the back. Oh, no, no, no, no, I'll be fine. - I will sit in the back. - No, no, really, I insist. I always sit in the front. I'd be happier in the back this time. Why should you be uncomfortable? You have a sore hip. No, it's not uncomfortable. There's no difference, really. It's just the view is better in the front seat. Okay, if there's no difference I'll sit in the back. Mr. Shapiro, please. I have made up my mind. [Isaac humming] Okay, you guys are good to go. I'll see you in about a half an hour, okay? Thank you, sweetheart. Have fun. She's off to buy supplies for some art project she's doing at school. I didn't really realize she was so into art. Opera was always my passion. I didn't have a good enough voice to be a singer, but I couldn't get enough of hearing it. I used to love to listen to Saturday Afternoon at the Opera on the radio. Of course, I couldn't listen too loudly if Jack was home. Jack was my husband. Fortunately, he was a golfer, so he was out most Saturdays. I liked my wife best too when she wasn't around.

Come on, let's take a shvitz and we'll talk. But I just had a shower. Well, so you'll have another one, it won't kill you. Come on, they got a good one here, it's nice and hot. Let's go. ♪ Hey, Isaac, how's that son of yours doing, Michael? ♪ Hey--Paul, is that you? Larry! Hey, how you doing? I thought you were in Miami. I got back yesterday. Hey! Know who this guy is? Isaac Shapiro. Yeah, he was partners with Earl Kaufman. They ran that shop right around the corner from you, you know, just before it became a dry cleaners. I thought Ernie Freeman was Earl's partner. No, what are you talking about? Ernie--Ernie didn't even get into the business till years later, he was still in retail back then. Are you sure? Hey, Isaac, Isaac. [Thud] Isaac! Holy shit, he fainted! Here, help me. Isaac. - Isaac, you okay? - Isaac! [Echoed, distorted speech] [machine beeping] [snoring] He's gonna be okay, thank God. Just a few bruised ribs, but they're gonna keep him in hospital overnight - just to be sure. - How did he do that? He fainted. Dehydration was the cause. He was taking a steam bath. I didn't know there was a steam bath at the residence. No--no, no, no, dear, he was at the Jewish community center. If you can believe it, he was trying to get in shape. And you were there with him? No, of course not. What on earth would I be doing there? Well, I thought you were with him when it happened. No--no, Charlie told me there was an accident on the phone and I-- I ordered a cab and I rushed straight down here. I really wish you had given me more information in your message, Mother. I tried to call you back, but you wouldn't pick up. Why do you keep turning that thing off? - I'd finished the call. - But I was racing around in a panic, worried that something had happened to you. I'm sorry, I didn't do it to worry you. I'm very concerned about Isaac, that's all. I don't know why you didn't just call the hospital to see how he was instead of rushing down there. I mean, you hardly know the man. Please don't lecture me on how to run my life. I've managed perfectly well so far, thank you very much. Okay. I don't wanna argue with you, Mother, I was just worried about you, that's all. You have a strange way of showing it. What is that supposed to mean? Well, not visiting me, for one thing. I mean, if it weren't for Sarah, I would never get out of that place. Well, why don't you ask one of your friends to take you out? They don't like driving in the city. But you got to admit, it worked, right? You end up in a hospital and she runs right up by your side. How romantic is that? Huh? You're sweet on her, right? You're sweet on her. What is this, like, major league we're talking? - You're talking sports now. - No, no, no, no, no, I'm only talking about how serious is it. Isaac. Is this the real thing, huh? Who knows? I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I thought all this had passed me by. Hey. All I know is, you're not too old. You are one lucky fella, because they don't make 'em like that anymore, especially around here. I'm wasting my time, I gotta go. Things to do, people to see. - She's beautiful, Isaac. - Thanks, Charlie. You're welcome. [Sighs] Hey, Charlie, what about those tickets for the game on Saturday? Don't worry about it, I'll pick 'em up. Wh--where's Ben? He's not here again, it's getting to be a habit. Lemme go round him up. Oh, what's the point? We should all just let him be. He doesn't wanna play and he just slows down the game. Why, you're in such a hurry to go somewhere? It's something for him to do, - he enjoys it. - He doesn't enjoy anything. Oh, it's easy for you, you don't have to share a room with him! He doesn't even look out the window and his bed is right next to it. That's his choice. But I didn't have any choice. He was there first and now I have to wait until he gets transferred or dies before I can have the window! That's no way to talk. I don't care, it's not fair. I love to look out the window. And I can't. He doesn't and he's right next to it. It's not fair! - Who said life was fair? - Oh, you sound like my mother, she said that all the time. Hey, why are you getting so worked up? - Did you take your pills? - So who are you? Are you my doctor now? You're lucky I'm not your vet or I woulda had you put down ages ago. Whoops. - [Cackles] - That's not funny. - Yes it is. - It surely is. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Katherine! ♪ ♪ I'm so sorry, Isaac. Charlie told me about Ben. They were going to send him to the full care floor as soon as a bed was available. He told me he didn't wanna end up there and I don't blame him. Are you... saying he might have done this on purpose, that it wasn't an accident? He loved his wife so much. They couldn't have children, so... he gave all of his love to her, then when she died, he stopped living too. Now who knows? God knows. Maybe they're together again. ♪ That's Ben's suit, isn't it? I want him to look good at his funeral. He deserves that. ♪ ♪ At first, he tried to hide it from me. But it didn't take long for me to realize he was very sick. - Cancer? - Of the pancreas. It was all over in six weeks. Poor Jack. It was painful to see him fade so fast. Do you miss being married? Thank you. Well... Jack was a decent husband. But all he ever wanted was to be a dentist in the small town where he grew up. A dentist is a very good business, everybody has teeth. Yes. But I wanted more. Mostly, I wanted to travel. I wanted that sense of adventure and passion that I saw in the operas. I asked him if we could go to Italy for our honeymoon. I wanted to go to Milan to hear Maria Callas sing Nabucco at La Scala. I even planned to surprise him and wear the red dress that I wore the night he and I met. But he didn't like Italian food, so we went to Arizona, where he could play golf. Especially on Saturdays. [Katherine laughs] Well, he promised that he would take me one day, but I don't think I ever really believed it would happen. He and I had-- we had such different dreams. I was young when we got married. I didn't see that then. Once I did... ...it was too late, I was already pregnant with Helen. So... ...the red dress stayed in the box, just like me. This is special to you, this place in Milan? Oh, La Scala is the most famous opera house in the world. Verdi premiered many of his best operas there. Yes, he's my favorite composer. Oh, I love others-- Puccini, Mozart, Bizet. But Verdi is the one who really touches my heart. You should go. You should go! - You deserve it. - Oh, I don't know. I never really thought about doing anything like that. You know, going on my own. Now is the time. Unless you have a dream to spend the rest of your life in this place. It's like-- it's like they say. Life isn't fair... ...then it's over. ♪ Mother, are you sure you don't need - any help with that? - No, no, I'm fine. I thought Sarah was coming to take me out today. She has an assignment at school today, but she said that you'd understand. Well, we were also going to go to dinner. We can still do that. I took the afternoon off. I thought I'd take you to that little Italian restaurant that you like so much. Well, I don't want to get back here too late. Isaac and I have plans together later. ♪ ♪ ♪ Roger and I are separating. Separating? - For how long? - I don't know. But there's going to be some big changes, Mother, and you're not going to be very happy about them. - What does that mean? - It means the market is very difficult for me right now. I'm just not making the kind of money I need to be making. Well, does that have something to do with me? [Helen scoffs] I am on my own now, Mother, I have to support myself. You wouldn't understand that because you've never been on your own and you've never had - to earn a living. - That's not fair. I dedicated my entire life to you and your father. Yes, you were dutiful, Mother, but you resented us. Don't speak to me that way. - I always loved you, Helen. - Did you? What does Roger have to say about all this? Roger? I trusted him completely with our finances. I never saw this coming. [Knocking] Katherine? Are you there? The door's open. I listened to that opera. Lot of good tunes. Katherine, what's wrong? I can't go back. Where? Roger and Helen are separating. I--I knew that they were having problems. But I thought they'd sort them out. What about you? They want me to stay here. Well, if it's just for a little while while they work things out, isn't that okay? It's more complicated than that. Apparently, Roger made some bad investments and they have to sell the house. So Helen doesn't know where she and Sarah will end up living... ...but she said that there wouldn't be room for me there. I don't understand. How could she do that to you? No, it's my fault, really. When Jack died, he left me with plenty of money. But I... I'd never been on my own before, and... ...I didn't wanna live by myself. I was afraid... ...of being alone. You are not alone. I'll stay with you, if you want. [Isaac humming] I was just thinking about my wedding. When Jack kissed me at the end of the ceremony and I thought, "Well, that's it. He's the last man I'm gonna kiss for the rest of my life." Made me feel sad, in a funny way. Mm! I couldn't live here forever, Isaac. Makes me feel old. You make me feel like a kid again. Mm-hm. So do you remember what you said yesterday? I said a lot of things. Well, you were right. That surprises you? You said I deserved it. So... I'm going to make my dream come true. I've decided to go to Milan. I'm going to go and hear the opera at La Scala. Look, there it is. Isn't it beautiful? Then I'm gonna tour all around Italy and visit every other major opera house. When is this going to happen? Soon as I can stand up and walk on my own without falling over. But you said you never go anywhere on your own. I was hoping you'd come with me. - Me, go with you? - Mm-hm. Well, why not? What's keeping you here? I don't know, I don't know. I just--I need some time to think it over. All that money your son invested for you? What's it for? I was saving it for my old age. [Katherine laughs] Could I speak to Michael Shapiro, please? Do you know when he'll be back? No? No, it's not important, just tell him his father called. Hey, Isaac. The doc is lookin' for you. So, as you can see, the erosion only appears on the x-ray that we took right after you fainted. There's no trace of it here on the one we have from a year and a half ago. I'm gonna send you to Mount Sinai first thing in the morning for an MRI. There's every reason for optimism. Catching something like this this early on increases the chances of a positive outcome enormously. [Gunshots and hooting from TV] - [knocking] - Isaac? Isaac? May I come in? Isaac, you'll never guess where I've been. I went to a travel agency and I got some wonderful brochures for our trip to Italy! I'm not going to Italy. - What did you say? - I'm not going to Italy. But Isaac... I-- I don't understand. Italy is your dream, not mine, so go. But the other night, you said that-- The only reason you want me to go is because you're afraid to go on your own. [Katherine sighs] [TV chatter continues] [horse whinnying] [Isaac grunts] Stupid, stupid. Isn't it strange the way she left in the middle of the night like that? Pretty odd. I mean, where would she have gone? Obviously she didn't wanna be here, 'cause she thinks she's way better than the rest of us. Why did you keep going on like that? Well, don't you think it's strange? Must be the booze. Well, as my grandma used to say, there's plenty more fish in the sea. What's up with her now? She's going fishing, apparently. [Chatter] She better change her bait. [Laughing] Actually, it's lovely. I treated myself to a suite. Well, I don't think it's a waste of money. And besides, I thought it was time I started spending a little of my money on me. It won't be for very long. You were right. You were right about me not venturing out enough on my own. I'm going to the opera. In Milan. Helen? That's right. By myself. [Knocking] Hey, Isaac. You gonna stay in there all day or what? Isaac. [Phone ringing] Hello? Oh, hi, Charlie, what a nice surprise. Oh, no. No, I didn't, I didn't know. [Chatter] It's called multiple myeloma. I looked it up on the internet. It's got something to do with bone marrow and blood antibodies. It's pretty serious. But they say the prognosis is good. It's real good if you get treatment in time. But... But what, but what, Charlie? But you know Isaac and doctors. He's refusing any treatment. Oh. They're trying to get in touch with his son. They thought maybe he could convince him, but they've had no luck. He should've told me. Well, you know, he's got a heart of gold, Isaac, but sometimes that brain needs polishing. I think he was just doing that just to protect you, Katherine, that's all. The thing is, we've gotta convince him that he's got to take the treatment and he's gotta do it now. I'm gonna talk to him. Oh, good, good, good. That's gonna do it, believe me. Thank you. He's a pain in the ass. ♪ [knocking] ♪ Isaac? ♪ What? Hey. Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. Um, I'm just here to grab the rest of Gran's stuff. And to bring you this. She wanted it to be a surprise. You wanna check it out? Yes. Okay. Um... I, I loaded it, um, with Gran's favorite music already. You remember that song you listened to that first time at the mall? - Uh-huh. - You wanna hear it again?

Maybe you ought to have a little more faith. When I'm with you, I do. Well, you're stuck with me. [Speaking in foreign language] Or something like that. You know, I'm gonna have to work on my Italian. Well, it's one thing ordering dinner in an Italian restaurant, but expressing grand operatic passions, that is another. It's easy. Is it? That's amore. Okay, that's it. Sarah, you can take that right into the bedroom. I didn't realize I packed so much. Mother, can you please be careful? - Let me do that. - Okay, okay, okay. Throw out the garbage. [Phone ringing] It's Charlie, Grandma. He wants to know what kind of wine he should bring on Saturday. Tell him to bring some bubbly. It's a celebration. And from now on, we're gonna be drinking it every day. Excuse me. So, I understand that your son is a lawyer. Yes, he's going to try and make it on Saturday, but he's very busy, he's always traveling. Ah, yeah. Roger was just like that. What can you do? It's his own life, I mean, he--he doesn't need me except to nag him to get married. But don't you need him sometimes? I get by. But it's a good thing that you're around for your mother. I'm just glad you guys are back together again. So am I. Here, hang on. You said you wanted to take Isaac one time, because he's never been, and my friend's dad sings in the chorus. So he gets these comps. They're sort of a housewarming gift since I can't make it Saturday. La traviata? Giuseppe Verdi. He's your favorite, right? He is. Oh, you are a darling! Thank you so much. Oh, Sarah. [Chuckling] He just fell asleep. Right in the middle of our conversation. It's the medication. Oh. It really tires him out. [Operatic singing] That's from Carmen. Sarah did it. I asked her just to change one of my settings. Okay. Don't look at me like that. Everything's gonna be fine. Isaac and I are both adults, you know. - Okay. - Mm-hm. Is he doing all right? Better than expected. And how about you? I've never been happier. I'm glad. - I'll call you tomorrow. - Okay. Bye, and thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. ♪ She's gone.
