I'm done. I'll have the proofs from the Ali-Frazier fight by 6:00. Make it 4:00. Everybody out. Serial killers, fruit loops, lies and Jesus. That's what sells magazines, Bob. You should lose all those corny war photos out there. What have you got for me? I don't have time for a cocktail-hour sip and grin. I want you to speak at the opening of my exhibition. I just want you to say something about how great I was. - Uh... was? - Yeah, how great I was. I mean, how great I still am, of course. But, you know, way back then when you could be great, when the truth still meant something. So, yeah, you just have to say that I'm the greatest photographer that 'LIFE' magazine has ever had. But you aren't. You're the single most impossible photographer that 'LIFE' has ever had. Well, fuck it. Just say that, then. I can't, Gene, I told you when you called, I'm out of town that week, I've got a board meeting. Look, Bob, I'm done. I'm tired. My body's older than I am. I'm always in goddamn pain. I can't trust my fucking dick anymore. Constantly in a foul mood. Even the fucking drugs bore me. My kids won't speak to me. You know... I could go head first into a fucking shrimp cocktail at any given moment. And I'm broke. I'm sorry, Gene. I wasn't looking for your sympathy. I was just stating the facts. By the way, if anyone should be asking for sympathy, Bob, it should be you. Look at this dreck you're churning out. Amazing. No ladder and you got all the way up on your high horse, just like that. We practically give this magazine away to our readers. We cover all the major issues that touch their lives, issues from all over the country, all around the world. We do it every week. On top of that, we fight television sets for the same eyeballs you took for granted would always be there. It gets worse. All the time. What we do, what I do every day, is find a way to pay for all of this and keep it going. What we put on the cover, what we put in the middle of those stories, that's what does that. Wow. Well, your horse is obviously much higher than mine. Consider this as an overdue thankyou. A royalty cheque you found in an old pair of corduroys. Cash it at the branch on 17th and 6th. Keep it off the books that way. You know that you're only sitting behind that desk because of dogs like me, right? Good luck, Gene. Don't waste what time you got left. You're a dick, Bob. The date is Sunday, February 28th, 1971. Well, it's me. I've done it. I've done the retrospective and now I don't have to do any more things. Ahhh. I sold all my stuff, you know, my equipment, what have you, and I'm gonna make sure that you guys get the money for that, 'cause, uh... And, you know, I hate to sound maudlin, but, um... ..I think it's time for me to... Goddamnit. I'm coming! - Mr Smith. - Now's not the time. Hi, I'm Aileen. And this is our photographer, Giichi. Thanks. Thank you. Wh-why is this man giving me cookies? Fuji Film. We are here for the advertisement. Oh, that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, Christ. Well, look, um, I'm gonna have to level with you. I have consumed quite a whole lot of alcohol and I... What did he say? Giichi says you are his favourite photographer and the reason he's gotten into the field. Well, that's very nice. That's very nice. And... and... and... what about you? Have you never heard of me? Not before this morning, no. So you're not a fan? It's too early to say. Alright. What do you want me to do? They want you to say that Fuji colour film is more vibrant than any other colour film on the markets. It's the only colour film you trust. Turn that shit off. Turn everything off. Um... Do they really want me to say that? Yes. It was part of the deal. Wow. Holy cow. Oh, fuck. You know, I've never shot in colour. Ever. Not once. Never ever. And anyone who knows my work will know that. So that's a very big problem. I'm sorry, but it's in the contract. Did I sign the contract? Will Naughton is playing at Francesco's tonight. Join me. Alright. Then let's get on with the puppet show. So, are you going to give me a photography lesson? Oh, listen, I would, but I've... I've... I've damn near sold off all my, uh, equipment. I need to send money to my kids, rent's way overdue, and, uh, my bank account just walked under a duck. - So... - What duck? Oh, not a... Not... not a real duck. Never mind. Sometimes you just get... fed up with it. You know, sometimes. I used to be more fun. I used to be a lot more fun. I swear to you. I bet you were a fun dad to have five kids. No. No, I wasn't. Not even close. I was never there. I was gone all the time. Absent. No Little League. No Barbies, no Easy-Bake Ovens. I missed it all. I had a great time with you tonight, Aileen. I... ..didn't just happen to get this job with you. Uh-huh. There's a company in Japan... ..that's been dumping their toxic waste into the sea for years. The Chisso Corporation. People are getting sick and dying. The people need help. There's a resistance on the ground, but we need global attention. We need you at the shareholders meeting next week. Oh, well, I'm afraid that Japan has seen the last of me, kid. That was 25 years ago. Listen, if that's why you're here, I'll put you on a long list of people that I've disappointed. I'm terribly sorry. Look, I've got a few things to do, you know. Defenestration and whatnot, you know, so... Sorry, I did that all wrong and I've upset you. It wasn't my intention. No, no, it was a lovely night. It was. Hmm. Yeah. Here's some information. Please have a look. My number is on the envelope. Take care, Aileen. I love the, uh... the suggestion for the centre. It looks really... It looks ideal to me. This centre is very strong. - Yeah, um... - Robert. Good. Robert, huge crisis in Japan. Mercury poisoning. There's your Pulitzer Prize. - Gene, what the hell?! - People are dying, Robert. Yeah, all day, every day. Doesn't mean you get to fuck up my layout! Oh, goddamnit. Am I interrupting your little layout? Now, you guys just go on and make room for your fucking Oil of Olay ads while innocent people drop like flies, huh, Bob? You're talking about Minamata. Yeah. See, she knows. She's smart. Is there anybody else here as smart as her? A factory there's contaminating the bay of some fishing village. See? First, they called it 'The Strange Disease', then 'Dancing Cat Fever' and now it's simply called Minamata disease. It's fucking monstrous. I've been following it in the 'Herald' and 'The Times'. Small stories every couple of months. But no-one has really covered it. I mean, it's in the goddamn fish. And that's all those poor people have to eat. 'The Times' has a Tokyo desk. And we have deadlines literally in one hour. So that sounds to me, Bob, like, uh, yeah, time is of the essence. And you know that the cover-up is gonna be as much of a story as the story itself. I gotta go. Come on. You expect me to send you? You'd be a real dumbass not to. Gene, stop. A moment, if you please. This is the story, Bob. You know this is the story. - I'm not sending you. - What? Why not? Gene, I'm gonna throw you out of the goddamn window. I wish you would've done that last time I was here. Gene, listen closely. If I don't send you, you can't fuck me on this, you understand what I'm saying? No. Call me at home. Don't call me here. And you can't disappear on me again. Bob... ..I would never disappoint you again. Just try not to disappoint yourself. Gene, let's go! I'm coming! Hello. Take off your shoes... Take off your shoes. - Excuse me. - Thank you. Listen! Children are asleep. So, let's be quiet. Ahh. You must be quiet. The children are sleeping. Oh. OK. - Uh. Ah. - Mmm. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. This is not much. Thank you very much. - Please, have some food. - Thank you very much. Honestly, I don't really have so much of an appetite right now. But it's... it's definitely coming back. This food is... I'd... I'd like... I'm interested... What? I'm interested in this. Try this one. Mmm! - Very good? - Mmm. Mmm! It is good, isn't it? - Is it good? - Mm-hm. Mmm. Mmm. - It is good. - It is good. - Very good. - Hmm. Mmm. Well... Actually... It is hard to talk about those things. It is not just about us. It's not easy to speak about certain things. Akiko is our oldest. They tried to tell us it was cerebral palsy, but we knew better. She was born very sick and she remains sick. And she will never get better. We are strong family. She is our treasure. We have six children, and we all work hard to take care of Akiko. It takes five hours a day to feed her, but she brings us closer as a family. When you meet her, you'll see. She is a beautiful soul. We don't want to bring attention to our family... but we don't have a choice. I drive a truck for Chisso. For Chisso! But it's not enough to take care of a family with the needs we have. - I will translate you later. - Oh. Oh. Can you, uh... Can you please thank them for their kindness, their... their generosity and for their hospitality? And if... if it's at all possible... ..to... photograph Akiko, perhaps tomorrow. Hmm. - We thank you for your kindness. - Ah, ah. Not at all. If you don't mind... Can we take some photos of Akiko tomorrow? Well really, that kind of thing... ...you'll have to excuse us I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry. Thank you. - She will make our bed. - Hmm. OK. - Please! There's nothing much left but... - Thank you. Oh. Oh, Aileen? Would you mind asking if he might have just a little... ..you know, sloop? Yeah. Ahh. Excuse me! Excuse me! He seems that he cannot fall asleep. Oh! Do you have anything to drink? A drink? Just one minute. He's got some? - He loves whiskey for sure. - Probably. Whisky. - Whisky. - Oh. Good. Whisky. Whisky. - Good. - Good whisky. - Good night. - Good night. Ohh. Oh. Many are tired of fighting or they don't want to bring attention to themselves. Then there's us, the Direct Negotiations Group. We are not so easy to keep quiet. I can imagine. Kiyoshi is one of the lead activists for the Direct Negotiations Group. Here. I got a light. I got a light. His son was born with the disease. Kiyoshi also has it, but it's yet to be officially recognised. Alright? Got it? - Thank you. - For sure. It's in my hands and in... in my vision. But it's my son and those like him that keep me going. Keep me fighting, you know. Sure. Does it ever affect your ability to shoot? Oh. I may waste a little more film than I should. But, for some reason, with the camera, I'm not so bad. What, uh... What's your endgame in this? Chisso doesn't believe us patients. They don't believe we are suffering. So we want to look the president in the eyes. We want him to see us and then tell us that we don't suffer. What makes you think he's gonna listen to you? I don't know. Maybe if we make a noise loud enough, they won't have a choice. With you, we have a better chance. Last night I rode my bicycle all the way up to Tsunagi... ...because I heard about one family. At first, they didn't want to let me in. I asked them why... they haven't been seen in the neighbourhood lately. I could see the shame on their faces. It turns out their young boy was very sick with Minamata disease. I asked them to join us, that we wanted help. They considered but ultimately their shame won out and they declined. They love their son just as they should. In all cases of Minamata, there is someone to blame. The suffering is caused by an evil... ...that we know as a fact! So, here we are. We have a choice. We can let the world know. If we are loud enough, they will listen. Accept your responsibility! Come on. Accept your responsibility! Is he alone? I think so. I hate that shit. I used to fucking hate gym class. They used to make us all sit down in a row, cross-legged, you know? And I couldn't do it. My legs just don't work like that. They don't work like that. And... I know you don't understand a word that I'm saying, but that's not gonna stop me from talking, so... ..you might as well just dig in, kid. You like jazz? Well, you'd better, 'cause jazz... jazz is what we've got. It's just fucking jazz. Improvisation. Everything. See this? Anyone could do this. Anyone. Takes nothing. You point, focus, click. And most important... fuck up. Fuck up because that's the only way to learn. So... ..you take it, kid. I'm sick of it. I should have known better... coming here. So you go on. Play the music. I'm, uh... I'm not really sure if I can hear it anymore, you know? I don't believe you. I mean, what kind of photographer gives the camera away? Unbelievable! Passing the torch, Aileen, is how one dies gracefully. Somebody said that once. - You alright? - What? Yeah, Kiyoshi. It's probably best you know this now. I disappoint people and I disappoint people always. Where are we? Ah, Aileen found you two a little home to stay in. - What? Really? - Yes. Me and her? Yes. Wow. That was nice. Come with me. We also put together a darkroom for you. I set it up just the way you have back home. Thank you. Pleasure. Gene, good news. We're moving up your piece. I think we might have an issue with more photographs than car ads for the first time for three years. It turns out there's a UN environmental conference in Stockholm in a month. Very first of its kind. We need to coordinate the two. Gee whiz, Bob, I don't think I've heard you, uh, this excited since they faked the moon landing. And Millie has shaken every tree with the anti-nuke folks and the WHO here and in Japan. We have all the science to highlight your images. Is he saving his receipts? So, how's it going out there? Oh, it's... it's fun. It's fun. I'm having a great time. I wish you were here. I'd... I'd... I'd let you buy me a drink. There's no wiggle room on this one, Gene. If we don't have the images by next week, we won't make it. You know what? What?! - Gene... - I got a bad connection, Bob. - I've got a bad connection. - Gene... Yeah, I might have had a little something to drink and I didn't know what I was doing. I asked the people to give whatever cameras and film they had. Oh! Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Maybe you can join me thanking the people. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Thanks. Bow. Alright. Thank you. Thank you. That's my camera. Is this yours? Yeah, that's me. That's mine. Great. Got it. Alright. Well, that's alright. How do we turn it to photos? - What? - How is it turn into photos? Then you turn it like this. Alright? Turn it like this. Come here, you do it. Give me your hands. Here. Take that. OK? Right? Put that hand there. OK, now, I got you. Now, just turn it like that. Right? - Like that. - Aren't you afraid of touching me? You're not afraid to touch me? Why would I be? Your hands shake because you have Minamata disease too? No, no. No, no. I... No, I just drink a bunch. What's this kid's name? Sigeru! Ah. Now... Gene. Um... it's getting late. Maybe he should be in bed, no? Thanks, kid. He wants to learn how to make the film strip into big pictures. Um, I'm not really here to give photography classes. Especially to kids. OK, I'll teach him. I'll teach you. Um... you take it. Here. You got it? And you will take some pictures, huh? And we'll develop them later. Hmm. OK? Thank you. Thank you. OK, pal. - Pretty good, that kid. - Mm-hm. - You like that one? - Can I have it? No. You can't just have it. No. Maybe I can help? You know, uh... ..the Native Americans, they believed that a photograph would take a piece of the subject's soul. But what... what gets left out of the fine print is... ..that it can also take a piece of the photographer's soul. You understand what I'm saying? It, uh... It will break your heart. So, if you take it... ..you take it seriously. Agreed? This way. - Put your stuff here. - Mmm. It's for my aunt. Goddamn. Phew. I'm glad that worked. May I? May I? Yes. OK, I'm gonna see if I can find something we can use at the shareholders meeting. It's OK to take a picture. Just don't show his face. Right. Hey, listen. People must see what's going on behind the eyes because that's where the truth is. It's an empathy thing. - I need faces. - Well, we need empathy here. OK. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. OK. Let's go find the nursery. Oh. That's... Yeah. Uh, let's turn around now. - Let's go. - Go this way. Just keep going. Just keep going. Slip in here. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. Gene! Aileen! I found the lab. Dr Yamashita's been the chief doctor for Chisso since the first victims showed up. They had to be running tests. They must have found something. Hey! I found something. It says the cat he fed from Chisso's pipe water reacted just like the patients. Spasms. Paralysis. Convulsions. Which is exactly what happened when one is poisoned with mercury. It literally destroys brain tissue. And for 15 years, they knew. They knew, Gene. And they kept poisoning people. Give me that. You turn around, pick up your camera, check your settings. You cannot let your emotions run the show 'cause you will fucking lose and sometimes you might fucking die. Focus on the photograph you want to take. Focus on what you want to say. Do it now. You remember how it affected you emotionally, right? How did it make you feel? Was it unpleasant? A... a menace? Was it evil? Just over here. You're changing. Many things. Yeah. OK. Now... Take it out. Dump it in the soup. So here's a little secret of mine. Use your hands a lot. Caress the image. You warm the print with the body heat from your hands. That's how you tell your story. OK. Now, here. Dry your hands. Thank you. What for? Oh, wait. Ooh. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Click. Aren't you supposed to ask permission first? Permission... permission is like asking for a kiss, no. It destroys the moment. You just gotta take it. Like that? Something like that, yes. Yeah. Just, uh... ..try not to forget about the fine print, kid. Hmm. If human beings are still the masters of creation... we have to overthrow this poisoned world. Is this civilisation? Is this the so-called period of rapid growth? But done at the cost of sacrificing countless lives? Our beautiful blue ocean is now made into a deadly sea by those people. So, if you are a human being, please stand up... and fight! Remember, we never wanted a war. But we have to fight. Let's make this the last battle for humanity. Please stand up! Go! Go! - No, no! - What are you doing? Gene! It's OK. I'll be back. Mr Smith. Come in. - Thank you. - Please sit. Would you like something to drink? Water? You know, I actually think I'd rather wait until I get outside the building before I drop dead, so, um, perhaps a soda pop, you know, with the top still on it, in the bottle. OK. Thank you. Mr Smith, do you know what 'parts per million' means? Without getting confused by all the science, it is a very, very small amount. And small amounts are accepted. Even in this bottle, unopened bottle of cola... ..there may be the tiniest amount of some material you might not expect or appreciate. But it's microscopic. Barely even there. May I show you something? Look over there. The Cyclator. We spent much money creating a system that keeps the water safe. Huh. I even drank from it to prove its safety. It's... it's a great photograph. It's really a nice photograph. - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. So... let's take a walk. Do you know what we make here? Toxic chemicals. Good chemicals. Chemicals that have fertilised the land. Help feed millions. And chemicals needed to make plastics, even medicines. Also chemicals for developing photographs. And chemicals that make 35mm film. Like the kind you use yourself, Mr Smith. We employ over 60% of the residents here. If the protesters succeed, and they put Chisso out of business, what happens then? I mean, how the fuck would I know? I know that you are broke, Mr Smith. That you owe money and that you are on brink of getting evicted. You are correct, sir. You are very correct. But I've still got my youth... ..and my girly charm, which I think will get me through. A father is supposed to provide and protect his children. Obviously, you care more about yourself than your own flesh and blood. Now, you may choose to believe the small amount of the local fishermen who claim that they have somehow been harmed by our methods. But, I am sorry to say, they are the parts per million, relative to the greater amount, the greater good. You know, for a second there, I thought you and I was gonna be good pals, but I can see now that I was sadly mistaken because you, sir, are full of fucking shit. - Please follow me. - Certainly. Why not? Spanky and Alfalfa gonna shoot me in the back? I am a businessman. I make deals. Like we have done with the locals who have taken our payments since the '20s. It is even a line item in our budget. 50,000 American dollars. Here's the chance to amend your sins. And... uh... ..provide for the people that counted on you. You've led quite the career, Mr Smith. What else do you need to prove? Ohh. Chisso is winning back the support of the people... because we're influencing student activists... who are acting violently against Chisso personnel. This is not who we are. Chisso are the ones acting violently. We need to stay together on this or we'll lose. You know we'll lose! We've offered good terms. Chisso are promising compensation will be quick. We don't want any more fighting in the town... or shame brought to Minamata. Chisso is behind this. You are blind to it. That's not true! Is your goal to have Chisso move somewhere else? That's what they'll do and where will our town be then? This is not just about this town. It's about big companies all over the world invading the towns of good, hard-working people, and polluting their existence. It's happened before... and it will happen again! Don't get so emotional! Calm down! Don't cause any trouble. We understand how you feel. We are all in the same pain. But we all want it to end. The signatures speak for themselves. The people have spoken! This is the right way to settle the matter... for all. No more fighting! May we see the book? That's not necessary. Have you pressed your signature on this document? No. And you? Uh-uh. And you? They have overwhelming signatures of support in the book... yet they won't show it. Do we believe this is fair? Let us see the book! Show us! Show us! That's my signature. I never pressed it! That guy is dead. How could he have signed? You're right. He is dead! What's going on here? Tell us! You're full of lies! Hello. - Welcome. - Sorry for the intrusion. Shoes. Oh, goddamnit! Excuse us. Hello. Hello. Thank you. Let's eat together. Ohh. - Mmm. Hmm. - Hmm. Good, right? Huh? Can she see? - No. - No? Akiko can't see or talk. She's congenital. The foetuses absorb the mercury, sparing the mother. Hmm. Mr. Eugene, are you married? He has two children. Ahhh. Ah... What? What? What? What? What? She's asking if you have any pictures of your children. - Of my children? - Mm-hm. You know, uh... no. I'm ashamed to say that I don't. It's bad. Hmm. Unfortunately, he hasn't got any photos of them. I need to help Mrs Matsumura at the market. OK. Can you watch her? What? Akiko. No. No. I can't do that. You'll be fine. We'll be back in one hour. I am not the most responsible... - Stop it. - No. Let's go. I'll go out for a while. Don't get worried. I'll give you a bath soon, Akiko. I'm not so good at this kind of thing, you know? Sorry.

I'll accept the charges. Hello, Bob. Bob? It's terrible here. Yeah, uh, listen, there's no fucking chance. Gene, talk to me. OK. I'm coming home, Bob. I'm not going to get the picture and I can't do this shit anymore. And... and... and, by the way, it's been made very clear to me now that... ..that I am seriously unwelcome here. Bob? Bob, what's wrong? I went to the goddamn mat for you and you ask me what's wrong? Well, hey, I'm sorry. I don't give a fuck what you are! Listen to me, I need the pictures, Gene. I need this story and I need you to get me this story like nobody else can. No, you don't! Big people hurt little people. Little people get hurt by big people. Same thing here, same thing there. This picture, that picture. They all burn up in a fucking fire. What does it matter? And memory is the goddamn devil. But the people over there, they matter, right? I know that because you told me. No. You know what matters? Money. Money for my kids. Have you been drinking? Course not, Bob. I'm a professional. Jesus. Gene, hang up. Go back to sleep. In the morning, it will all seem different. You listen to me, pal. I was recently quite reluctantly escorted by a couple of goons to go and meet the top fella at the Chisso joint. What the fuck are you talking about? He offered me a whole lot of money, Bob, whole lot of dough, and I got to say, I gotta say, the dough was awful pretty. You told him how long and hard to go? Yes, I did. Yes, I did, like a dick. And you know what, I should have taken it. But I'm a dick. I'm a dick, Bob. Just like you're a dick. And do you know what? Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go right back there and I'm gonna grab it. I'm taking it. Don't you dare! Oh, yeah, no, listen. I'll wire it to you. You take back the six grand that I owe you. And then you send this to my kids, OK? Not OK, Eugene. Not fucking OK! You know how you always told me how much your kids hated you? You think a couple of grand's gonna make a difference? You really think your kids are that naive? Fuck you! I don't need to listen to that shit! You call me a sell-out. Here's the irony. I did, I did sell out to the board, to the boys with the abacus in the basement. Now I'm gambling the reputation of the greatest magazine. Bob, you gonna give me a pep talk? Because I actually may need to vomit first. 67% ads and I'm losing. Likely I won't even have my integrity to fall back on in my old age, but I will have yours! Dammit, Gene, I will have yours! I'll tell you what - if there's any left, I will stuff it into a fucking box and ship it to you. I don't know how many more issues I'll be able to publish, but one of them is going to have the most important photographic essay of the last 30 years or I will personally fly out there and kick your pathetic, whingeing ass! The kids in the office, the special ones, they don't look up to me. Hey, Bob... They look up to you, because you matter. And in reference to your last comment, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Just bring me the story, OK? Bring the story home. Still there, Bob? What the fuck?! What? Shigro. You... You know there's a zoom on that thing, right? Zoom. Argh! Ow! Do you have a gun or an aspirin? Or any drugs? No. You want to take a picture? Come here. Some people may come and go with the best of intentions... but we can't count on them. This is our fight. Why do you think Chisso are hitting us... harder and harder? Why do you think they're getting bolder and bolder? You know why. They can threaten us... but we are going to the shareholders meeting... Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me. I just want... Would you, um... Would you mind translating this for me? Um... Hi. Hello. Um, I'm really no good at public speaking. I suppose that I'm one of those a picture's worth a thousand words type of guys, you know? Anyway, that, uh... That doesn't... doesn't matter. I'm here to help, if I can. But I need you to help me. By allowing me... ..to spend some precious time with you and your family. So that I can help to fight your fight. So, I mean, the question is this. Who... who... is... is comfortable, and willing... ..to share these... ..these very precious, intimate moments... ..and to be photographed by me with the utmost care and respect? Thank you. Thank you. Ari... arigato. Thank you. What? What? Is that good? What does it mean? Are you drunk? No-one is ever drunk if they can lie down on the floor without holding on. We're gonna do this together. You are murderers! How many people are outside? Over 500. 500? Yes. Get out of here. I'm staying by you. It's too dangerous. Get out! Gene! Gene! Gene! Mr. President. We know there is verdict that will arrive soon. We hope that Chisso will accept responsibility for its negligence. We are not here for luxuries. Just to know that we will be looked after and able to die in peace. If you are human, listen to what we are saying. I and Sadae Ogata. I understand that you don't know who I am. But you should. Both of my daughters fell ill. Both suffered more than I can imagine anyone suffering, let alone a child. My eldest daughter suffered from convulsions for months. So much pain that she couldn't cry. She is dead now. And my other daughter, Miyuki... will never be able to spend a day without care. My husband and I cry often. We weep because we fear for what will happen... when we are no longer able... to take care of her. Mr. President... You've got nothing to say? You are a human being too, right? We are the same, and yet... how can we be this different? How can we? I am sorry. I truly am. No. What? No. What happened to you... What you have gone through... brings sorrow in our hearts. Please forgive us. She said you treat her with much dignity and respect. Thank you for that. She said you made her laugh. What the fuck is that? My child also has Minamata disease. He is nine years old. I work on the boats still... when the fishermen allow me to... but because of my symptoms... they don't want me on their boats. So, it's my wife that needs to work. She works on the boats sometimes... and many nights she is forced to take care of both of us. She can't do that forever. Can she? Mr. President. We know that you will pay for the old victims... but you must pay the same for the new victims as well. It's your responsibility! Am I wrong? Mr. Uyishi, can I have a moment? Gene! Are you OK? OK. I'm OK. Wh-what's this? What's this? Some... someone just brought it. What the fuck is that? What is that? He came when I was... It's the negatives from our darkroom! I don't get it. Where... where did they come from? Thank you all for coming and speaking with me. Your plight brings me much sadness. But we've added up the costs of your demands... - However... - We simply cannot pay. Unfortunately... this is our final answer. I can't take this anymore! Kiyoshi! Kiyoshi! They don't believe we're in pain. Kiyoshi! This blood is on your hands! Kiyoshi! Are you okay? We are ready. Can I move Akiko's legs? Excuse me. Can I move Akiko's left hand? Yes. Akiko, I will move your hand OK. Very good. Beautiful. - I... I can't. - Wait. Ohh. Oh. Fuck it. Hmm. Do me a favour. Get me the, uh... Oh. - ..my shutter reel. Yeah? Thank you. OK. Sonofabitch. He got it. He fucking got it. We have to pay. Somehow we will find a way. We must. We won. We won! Today, we have won the battle. But the war persists. We must continue to fight. To fight for our children... so their children have something... that they can fight for. But all of you here... and the people who stood with us... have taught me that this a fight we can win! Go home tonight and find some happiness with your families. Because tomorrow we have more to do. To fight for those that cannot.
