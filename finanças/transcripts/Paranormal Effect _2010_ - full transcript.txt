(Ominous rumbling music) (Static buzzing) I had this dream. I'm running in the woods. I look for him and I'm running. But I can't find him. Then I see a woman. She's sitting by the trunk of a tree. She's crying. And I closer to her and I try to see who she is. She turns around, and that's where I woke up. I didn't see her face. (Ominous music) So how much was this? [Darren] I don't really know in, in dollars, but it was a hundred and- - it looks really expensive. [Darren] It's not that expensive. It's so much cheaper than in the us. But you already have one. I could have bought a new bag with this money. [Darren] You could have, but this one, actually, I can, I can show my parents what Tokyo is like. When I go back to the us if it's that expensive, I can just sell it back on eBay. I'll still make a profit. It's so much cheaper here. Whatever. - Cool. - Wow. [Darren] So where's your grandma's house? [Reiko] Uh, let's see. Over there? (Elevator music) [Darren] Down in the forest somewhere? (Reiko laughs) Crazy. You guys really don't have room do you? (Reiko laughs) So what kind of, are we gonna be like in a three square foot house back to your grandmas'? Yeah, it's pretty small. [Darren] Is it? Mm hm. (Traffic roaring) (People speaking in Japanese) So I don't need to tell you what this place is. [Darren] Well, actually do tell me, I'm not exactly sure. Well, these are called love hotels. [Darren] Okay. So what are you doing in a love hotel? What do you make in a love hotel? (Reiko laughs) So what's the purpose of having like a hotel where you- - oh, well, see, you've seen how small the houses are here. There's no room for couples to have sex in Japan. Okay. You're being very direct. I think they're just calling it love hotel. Can't you do anything else besides sex? Like, I mean, you know, love each other in a more platonic way. No (laughs). They have, some of them have swings. Some of them have karaoke. Hey, you're still filming me. Okay let me shoot you. So I'm the star now, right? [Reiko] Yeah. (Motors rumbling) (Train squeals) [Darren] How long is it from here to the house? About an hour. It's embarrassing, you shouldn't shoot in the train. [Darren] Yeah, I guess I shouldn't, huh? Come on, stop. (Train rumbling) [Darren] How far is it? It's maybe about five minutes from here. [Darren] Okay. You got the key and everything? Yeah, it's right here. Well, you know what, I think I'm gonna take it out. Yeah, I just got a lot of stuff with me. - So you have the key or not? What are you talking about? Come on. You have the key, right? Why do you always have to do that kind of stuff? It's just stupid, man. It's like a 10 year old girl or something. You really think it's funny. (Reiko laughs) So this is the house of Mrs. Nagakura if I am not mistaken. And I will take you on a little tour. And then you have a bathroom, pretty fancy bathroom with, with every little feature to take a shower, should I say? And then we go up and it's, I think this should be the shower. And then it's basically just a two story house. And we only get to use, I guess, the top floor and somebody is using the first floor, I guess. I don't know who they are though. And, and some pictures. What do we have here? Holy crap. Is that, is that you in the picture? [Reiko] What? Which one? [Darren] That picture by the stairs? Yeah. That's me. [Darren] Wow. Is my suitcase interesting to you? [Darren] Well, it is. Yeah. Some how. And then we have a kitchen here, nothing fancy, I guess. [Reiko] Hey, you know what, stop filming. [Darren] Wait, wait, wait. [Reiko] Come and unpack. So reiko was a bit tense lately so we'll to take it easy with her. Obviously she's had a few problems with her daddy. She's got daddy issues right now, so we'll just make sure that we're not upsetting her too much. And let's go around the house a bit more. [Reiko] Darren! [Darren] What? - Darren, come here. - What? [Reiko] Come here right now! You have to look at this. - What's up? - Look at this. [Darren] What's up, sugar. Why are you waiting for me in the bathroom? [Reiko] Look at this. [Darren] Oh god, did you do this? [Reiko] What? No! [Darren] What the hell is this? [Reiko] How am I gonna clean this? [Darren] It's gotta be like sewage water or something that came up. Ugh, it smells horrible. I can't believe. [Reiko] You're gonna help me clean this. I'm not doing this. [Darren] How are we doing this though? It's like clogged or something in there isn't it? Gross. Well, when you get an idea of, you know how, it's like sewage water, isn't it? How long has it been sitting in there? I think it's Nietzsche that said, "if you stare into the abyss as long enough, the abyss stares back at you." I'm not sure I want this to stare back at me. (Static buzzes) Oh hey, mom? Hey. Sorry, oh did I wake you? Sorry. [Darren] Hey, don't forget to tell her about the shit in the bathtub. Yeah, we're good. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. We're just a little tired. The whole trip's been kinda long. Mm hm, yeah Darren's fine. - Yep, he's been good. - Say hi. Yeah. He says, hi. Yeah, mom, listen. So we walked into the house and I found some nasty water in the bathtub. Yeah, it was. It's just like this brown, gooey, stinky water. I don't know. I don't know if grandma did it, but it's, yeah, I tried draining it. [Darren] I think social services would have noticed if she had done it. Yeah. But I tried to. Yeah, I did. It just wouldn't drain for some reason. Okay. So who should I call? No, just turn that off please. Okay. I don't know who to call. This place looks just like it did a year ago. Was that the last time you saw her? Mm hm. Yeah. That's when she didn't recognize me. She thought I was a social worker. Well, are you sure that it was Alzheimer's because judging from those pictures, I mean, I probably wouldn't have recognized you either. You know what? That's not funny. (Static buzzes) No it was really serious towards the end. Hm. She would get out of the house in the middle of the night. She almost got hit by a car. Really? Sorry, that's not funny. Did you like- - but then we had to put her in a nursing home. (Static buzzes) Yeah, I know it's tough. I miss her. (Rumbling) (Objects shaking) Reiko! Reiko! Wake up, did you feel it? Reiko. I think it's a. Did you feel it? It was an earthquake. This thing was moving. I was freaked out. Reiko, come on. Okay. So this is the first time I ever experienced an earthquake and my girlfriend is sleeping right next to me. What would have happened if it were a bigger one? It's time to wake up. Oh. [Darren] It's like 10 already. Come on. (Reiko groans) Come on! Ah! [Darren] By the way, thanks for last night. What? [Darren] It was like this big earthquake. Didn't you feel it? No. [Darren] There was an earthquake last night. - There was? - [Darren] Yeah. I tried to wake you up, but you didn't. So I guess next time I'll just run away by myself and leave you here to die. If that happens again. Well, what else can you do? That's the whole point. You can't do anything. If an earthquake comes. [Darren] Yeah, you can hide under the doorframe or something. By the way, while you were sleeping, I scrubbed the bathroom. So the bathtub is pretty clean. There's just like this pretty gross stain remaining and I can't do anything about it. I might have to buy - thanks. - Like some kind of detergent. I'll take care of it. Ah! So what's the plan today. We're going to kamakura. Oh, is that the electronics town thing? No, I told you, that's akihabara. It's the same. Sounds the same to me to be honest. No. We're going to kamakura. They have all these shrines and the big Buddha. Okay. Fascinating. (Reiko laughs) All right. You want to go? We can change plans if you want. No, no, that's cool. As long as I can film all of it. Do you wanna go to akihabara? We can go next time if you want. Okay. We'll got to kamakura and- - I think you should check it out. - It's a nice city. - Yeah. I'm sure it is. It's very different from Tokyo. [Darren] We can be in Tokyo, you know, like just hanging out and having fun. Well, no, this is also part of the town. I mean, Tokyo's not the only place in Japan. Wow, look at that, a cemetery right next to a house. [Darren] Hm. (Birds calling) (Train rumbling) So where are we going? Where are we going? Um, to a shrine. [Darren] Okay. Is this your favorite shrine in and all of Japan? I've actually never been there before. Actually this whole area used to be a swamp around here. [Darren] Really? Mm hm. So they built this shrine. (Birds calling) (Rain pattering) It's always closed. [Darren] Hm. Hey, what's this? Check this out over there. Like some kind of pathway or something? Do you know what it says? I can read mountain. That's about it. [Darren] Whoa, almost slipped. Let's check it out. Oh, it's pretty steep. [Reiko] Yeah, be careful. (Air whooshing) Look at this. [Darren] Wow. What are these, like little caves or something? (Air whooshing) [Reiko] Gosh. [Darren] This like a cave or something? Maybe it's from the war. [Darren] You think so? (Phone beeps) (Birds calling) Do you know what that means? Let's see, I think, that's mountain and then that's god, so. - Mountain god? - Mountain god. [Darren] Is that where the mountain god lives or something? [Reiko] Maybe. [Darren] The resting place of the mountain god. Do you think that has something to do with the shrine also? I think so. I mean, look, 'cause that's. [Darren] So like the swamp was right by the mountain kind of thing. Right? 'Cause it used to be a swamp down there. Hold on. Reiko, check this out. All right, hold the camera. - Why? - [Darren] Hold the camera. I'm gonna show you something. It's gonna be pretty cool. - Woo! - Watch out. - You okay? - Yeah. [Darren] All right. Now, I'm going to say hi to the mountain god. [Reiko] What are you doing? I'm just, pass it to me when it's over the fence again. [Reiko] What? Don't. What are you doing? [Darren] Come on. [Reiko] Okay, I'm not- - come with me. - No, I'm not going with you! - It's all right. - Are you kidding, no. - [Darren] Come on, it's just a hole. - It's not all right. - It's just a hole. - It's not just a hole. [Darren] Do you think there's really a god in there? No I'm not going. [Darren] Come on. Where are you going? I'm just, I'm just I'm gonna- - you can't go in there. I'm gonna go. [Darren] Well don't you want to see me, like go in the hole? And like, I'm gonna film in there. I don't want to. You shouldn't do that. Come back, come back with me. - [Darren] No, hold on. I'll be, I'll be right there. Hold on. Wow, I can't see anything in here. (Static buzzing) It's pretty cool. Should check it out. Creepy. (Train clattering in distance) [Reiko] I really think that's a bad idea. - [Darren] Whoa, wait. What's this? Wow. That's cool. Where'd she go? Cool. Pretty cool place. Whoa! Whoa, slip. Are you angry? Come on, what do you think will happen? Come on. It's just, it was just fun. You think it's just a plain whole, right? [Darren] Nobody goes there anymore. Look, it's completely deserted. That's why, you're not allowed to go in there. [Darren] Why, 'cause nobody else goes there? That's not the point, that's not. [Darren] Come on. I mean, - I can't. - [Darren] You keep talking about like Japanese culture and everything, but come on you, you were raised in the United States. You don't know much about it either. And, and I mean, look, the only contact you have with Japanese culture is your father and I don't think it's anything- - okay, you know what, that has nothing to do with this. I don't even know why you're bringing that up. After all, you're just like a stupid foreigner. Visiting Japan, you think you can do anything. [Darren] Well, that's exactly, that's the same with you. You have never really lived in Japan. Have you? You're telling me that I'm a foreigner here? [Darren] Well, I mean the only person who's really local here is- - at least I have some respect to this culture. Okay? [Darren] Yeah. I'm sorry about that. I told you not to go in and you did and I don't know why you did. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. (Darren groaning) (Reiko screams) (Gasping) The demon of the mountain, it's back to kill me! You still, ah. You still angry about that shrine incident? (Reiko laughs) Ah, I killed my voice. (Reiko laughs) Are you still angry at me? [Reiko] No. Are you sure about that? What if the spirit of the mountain is angry though? [Reiko] I don't think that's happening. Shh. I think I can hear it. - Ra! (Reiko screams) [Reiko] Darren? [Darren] Yeah? [Reiko] Can you come here for a sec? [Darren] What's up? Yeah. What's going on? What's going on? Can you, what, um, what is this? [Darren] That's the stain I told you about. I don't know why, I can't get rid of it. I mean, the dark part looks like it kind of dripped to the side, that I can get rid of, but like the main dark part, it's like really thick. Okay. Well I'm not going to use that. Yeah. I'm not gonna use the bathtub. I'm just going to take a shower over here. [Darren] Wait, wait, wait, wait. No. Why don't you take, you can just stand around it. You don't have to shower- - [reiko] Why would I stand around it? No this is- [Darren] Well you're not gonna shower on the bathroom floor. That's ridiculous. How are you going to clean it? This is not the bathroom floor. This is where you shower. Okay. [Darren] Wait, wait. You're showering- - you were, wait, you were showering? [Darren] Yeah, I was showering in the bathtub, obviously. No, this is where you shower. And this is where you take the bath. [Darren] You mean in Japan? Yeah. So you shower, you take a bath after you've showered? Like once you're clean? Uh huh. [Darren] So what's the point of taking a bath? (Reiko laughs) Well, no. 'Cause otherwise then you, you, you. You don't take a bath if you're dirty. Okay? [Darren] Okay, whatever. It doesn't make any sense to me, but do whatever you want, if you wanna take a shower, take a shower in the living room, wherever, as long as you're happy with it. And as long as we can clean it afterwards. 'Cause I'm done scrubbing that thing over there. - Okay. - All right? So how did you sleep? Pretty good. Did you? Yeah. Except when you got up like three times in a row. What are you talking about? You got up three times in a row, I have to- - I did not! You got up three times. Like once maybe like, I think it was like one and then I don't know, like two, - I did? - 2:45 or something, 3:45, yeah. Really? What, you don't believe me? No, I don't. (Chuckles) You don't believe me, really? I don't believe you, I was sleeping. You messed around with the camera again. I was tot- - you're the one telling me you don't wanna use the camera, but you keep, you kept messing around with it. But you don't know how to use it. So you can't see anything. What are you talking about? You used the camera during the night. - I didn't. - You did. I don't even know how to work that thing! You were sleepwalking or something, I don't know what happened, but. Do you want me to show you? We have it on camera right there. Okay, show me. (Static buzzing) (Static buzzing) [Darren] So, what'd you have to say in your defense? Well, there's no proof that I did it. [Darren] Well. I mean- - there's only sounds in there. It's totally dark. [Darren] Well the one proof is that you can't use the camera. I would have taken off the lens cap at least, right? But yeah, but I don't remember doing it. [Darren] So who did it? What, how do you explain all those objects moving around the house then? What objects? [Darren] Well, take a look at this. Where did that thing go? They used to be like, what do you call it? Like a mumo, something? [Reiko] Omamori? [Darren] Yeah. It used to have like a, whatever. [Reiko] I moved it to the bed. [Darren] Oh, why did you do that though? I'm so stupid. - Are you still scared. - Just in case. [Darren] Of the mountain king? [Reiko] Just in case, for protection. Protection from what? Here, I'll get it. Thanks. I really wish you would learn how to fold your laundry on your own. Yeah, I know. So what's this exactly. It's like a wooden paper, right? Yeah. But it's more special than that. It's a, it's called an omamori. You go to the shrine at the beginning of the year on new year's day. And then they write your name. That's my grandma's name. Okay. And you put it up in the house at the beginning of the year. And then when the year ends, you bring it back to the shrine and you burn the old one. You get a new one and then you're protected for another whole year. So does that mean, for example, does that work for us if we're here? Because it says your grandmother's name. Right? No, but it's supposed to protect the whole household, so. Okay. Yeah. It doesn't matter whose. Is that why you put it up there? Are you scared? I'm not scared. It's just something that we have in the house. So Japanese people believe in that kind of stuff, like? Yeah, but it's, it's, yeah. I mean like, you know, spooky stuff like demons. No it's, well, it's, it's just really around us. I mean, my aunt, the other day, she was feeling a little tired and sick for about, I don't know, like two weeks. And so she actually went to the shrine. Got an o-harai done. What's o-harai? 0-harai is like when the priest actually takes away the spirits of the person so that you're basically cleansed. - Okay. - Yeah. And she actually felt better afterwards. That's like an exorcism. Well, yeah, kind of, I guess. So you got exorcised before? What? Did you get an exorcism before? No, I've never got it done, but. Maybe you should. Why? I don't know, you're kinda freaky lately. Things have been happening, you know? I don't know what you're talking about. Have you ever like seen a ghost or something like that? No. - No? - No. Hey, why's the camera on? Did you turn it on? Oh, you're trying to scan me again. No, seriously. I don't know why the camera's on. Seriously this time. And why would I know? Because you're trying to mess with me. You're putting this-no! Putting this right next to the bed just to pretend. Okay, so, you're- - it's reverse psychology. Right? And the guy who always has the camera on is saying this to me? I don't know. Anyway, it's just, I didn't didn't turn it on, so. I'll turn it off now. It's falling by itself. Something is happening here. I can feel it! Ow. Ow. (Static buzzing) (Ominous rumbling) Okay. So let me check. Let me show you this. Got a little surprise to you from last night. Why did you shoot us during the night? You'll see, huh. Just wait. What am I doing? You just, you just, you're sleepwalking. - That's so weird. That's not me. - You're sleep walking. That's what happens when you sleepwalk, you walk and you sleep at the same time. But I don't sleepwalk. I never do this. Everybody's sleepwalks at one point or another- - no they don't. - They do in their life. Everybody, at least once in their lives, sleepwalks- - but I don't remember any of this! - You just don't know about it. - This is really creepy. - Obviously you're sleeping. And that's why you don't remember any of this. Now, now you go into the kitchen and you're like start saying the most random things. Why would I go to the kitchen? Beats me. You say the most random things. What is it? It's like, "go back, go forward." And then you go back to bed. I don't know the rest. I don't know what I'm saying. Well, that's it. You just, like you speak- - why did you have to film this in the first place? - I was just trying to show you. You didn't believe me last time. But it's not funny! Like, why, why did you have to film me? Like you're so obsessed with your camera. I was just trying to prove it. You don't believe me every time I tell you something. You think it's a joke, everything, everything I say or do as a joke. So now I'm showing you, this is what it is, like this is you are sleepwalking, big deal. - But this is really weird. This is spooky. You don't have to be freaked out about it. It's just sleepwalking. Okay? I don't sleepwalk. You sleepwalk. Duh, it's right here on the screen. That's not me. What else do you want? I'm just getting really sick of you with your camera the whole time. I'm just trying to prove to you, you don't believe me. You know, like we're sleeping. It's our private time. You didn't have to film us. - Okay, well- - okay, so turn that thing off! Like, I don't even know why you're filming this right now. I just wanted to show you the reaction. Turn it off. Turn it off. But now you believe me, right? - Turn it off. - You believe me right? Without the camera you would never, - you would have never believed it. - I'm not answering that. - That's my whole point. That's my whole point. Just turn it off. [Darren] Hey. You okay? Yeah. I'm a little cold. [Darren] Tired maybe. Huh? From all that sleepwalking. So today we're up to that akihabara, right? Yeah. You know, I think we should go back to the shrine. [Darren] But we went there yesterday. We haven't been to Tokyo. Like, we've only been to Tokyo for about three hours in three days. Come on. I think it's time to go and check it out. I'm a little freaked out about the fact that I was sleepwalking last night. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to freak you out. I was just trying to prove a point. And I was just an ass. Well, no, I'm just reading this thing here and it's like, talks about the (speaking in Japanese). [Darren] What's that? Numa? You know what numa is? [Darren] No, why should I know what numa is? I don't speak Japanese. Because I was saying that in my sleep yesterday when I was walking, [Darren] Was that you're saying? Numa? Yeah, numa. It means swamp. So were you saying like, "go back to swamp," or what? And I didn't, I never knew the word swamp until I read this now. [Darren] And? And that shrine, you know, that place, remember I told you it actually it was built to protect people from the swamp woman. The (speaking in Japanese), that's what it's about. [Darren] Huh. But didn't you read it about it? Like maybe you read about it before, you don't remember. And then, and then that word numa just came in your dream, you know, after that, it's just a subconscious thing. Yeah, maybe but. [Darren] So now, so we're you going back there today? Yeah. [Darren] Okay. So let's try to do it quickly. So 'cause after that, I kind of want to hang out in Tokyo, all right? Like during the night. Okay. But we're going to go. Okay? [Darren] Okay. So, we're here. - Same old shrine. - Okay, go. [Darren] Same old shrine. [Reiko] Go. You go. We're here for you. Go. Go up there and do as I told you. Put your hands together and bow. - Up there? - Yeah, up the stairs. [Darren] Here? [Reiko] Closer. There. [Darren] Should I? [Reiko] No, don't. Just the bow. - Okay? - Okay. Really, I meant it. I'm really sorry. Come on. No, I just feel like you think this whole thing is like ridiculous, right? I'm just not used to them, but that's okay. Let's go. I think I really think we did. [Reiko] No, I think it's stupid that you're not taking this seriously. - Here. - [Darren] I am taking this seriously. I'm trying- - [reiko] Take it. [Darren] Okay, let's go. - [Reiko] Let's go in here! - [Darren] No, no, no, no, no. You already had too much, a bit too much. Way too much, come on, come on, come on. We should go in there! [Darren] No, we're good. We're good. I heard that you, the Japanese don't, you know? Don't hold alcohol, do you? Stop it! Come on! You're embarrassing me now. You're the one who's embarrassing now. See, now I know how it feels. I'm really sorry, okay. (Reiko laughs) But stop that seriously. I don't know what it is. Just forget it. Let's just go home. Come on. It's like, we're gonna miss the last train and we're gonna be stuck here. Reiko, come on. (Breaths gasping) Ow. (Switch clicking) Shit. Reiko? (Reiko puking) Reiko, are you okay? Reiko, are you okay? (Groaning) Reiko? Reiko, come on and answer me. What's wrong? (Reiko gagging) Reiko, come on. Come on, you're freaking me out. Like what are you doing? Come on, get up. You okay? Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. I think you're just drunk. Come on. You okay? Let's go back. No, no, no not this way not this way. (Reiko speaking in Japanese) No, no, not this way. (Reiko speaking in Japanese) Reiko, reiko, come, come here. Come here. (Reiko speaking in Japanese) Come here. Over here. To the right, hold on. Let's go back to bed. All right. You're just drunk. It's okay, just need to lay down and sleep, all right? You've puked everything. Do you know where the fuses are? Obviously not. Where are the fuck are the fuses? (Static buzzes) Fuck. (Fuse clicks) What the fuck is this? Oh shit. (Grunts) (Water gurgles) What the fuck? (Ominous music) Hey girl. How are you feeling? (Back thumps) You okay? No, I don't feel well. [Darren] Yeah. You're a little bit hot. So you're feeling better than yesterday, though, right? Uh, kinda. (Tooth brush scraping) [Darren] So did you sleep okay? Yeah, I did. I still don't feel well. [Darren] Do you know if you got off last night or? What? Did I? No. I'm just wondering. I mean, 'cause I was, I was sleeping pretty well, so I was wondering maybe you got up or something and you know, maybe you felt sick or went to the bathroom or anything like that. No, my knee hurts though. I don't. Yeah, I don't know why. [Darren] Okay. All right. Well fine. At least you sleep fine now, right? Oh shit. (Scratching) (Tub banging) Reiko, reiko. Reiko, reiko, let's go. We're leaving today after all. No. [Darren] No, I got, you know what I got, I got to thinking, I think it's much better if we leave today, because then we can go to the airport early. We can take a hotel room there and just, you know, sleep in tomorrow. (Reiko mumbling) 'Cause you're feeling sick. There's no point in staying here any longer. You're not feeling good. I'm super tired too. I've prepared all the suitcases. We can leave now. It's a waste of money. Stay here. I don't wanna go anywhere. [Darren] Seriously. Let's just, let's just get going. There's, we-no. [Darren] Reiko. Let me help you out. And I'm going to get you up and running in no time. And you'll see, you'll be much happier when we get moving. Come on. Come on. Let's go. (Reiko groans) - (Man speaking in Japanese) - That's ok, he checked... - (Man speaking in Japanese) - That's ok. If you feel strange, we can always go back. So just tell us. (Man speaking in Japanese) Yeah, let's have a seat here. (Man speaking in Japanese) He's done exorcism here, in this room already. (Man speaking in Japanese) He says there's nothing in this room. (Man speaking in Japanese) He's filming to analyze later, if something happens to you. Okay. Now, do you remember what happened the night? I think I got out of that bed. (Woman speaking in Japanese) I think I somehow got to the kitchen. (Woman speaking in Japanese) But I don't know how I was there. And then I, yeah, and then I... (Man speaking in Japanese) What's he saying? Are you cold? Yeah. (Woman speaking in Japanese) Yeah. (Woman speaking in Japanese) It's so vague. It's blurry. Do you want to try out hypnosis? Yeah if... I guess. You're feeling relaxed. Every muscle in your body is relaxed. I'm going to count to zero and you will just hear my voice. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one zero. Now you can put down your hands. Remember the first time you entered this house. Who's with you? I climbed the stairs. Grandmother and grandpa are still here. And you are coming into this house two months ago. What do you feel? I feel lonely and then safe. You were in the room the last night. What do you see in the kitchen? Water. Rising, rising from everywhere. From the bathroom and the bathtub. Everywhere. What else do you see? The forest. Someone's running in the forest. It's dark. Someone. It's water again. (Man speaking in Japanese) What does it look like? Describe the person. It's, it's... (Hands clap) (Ominous chanting music) (Man chanting in Japanese) (Man speaking in Japanese) (Man speaking in Japanese) (Man speaking in Japanese) Water and swamp. Bathtub. (Man speaking in Japanese) (Crashing) (Hands clap) (Reiko crying) (Speaking in Japanese) He says I should go out, but I will stay in the room if you need. Let me know. I'll be back. It was him. Darren. It was Darren! (Body slams) Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, wait. (Speaking in Japanese) She need to go home. What? It's too dangerous. What happened? We start exorcism now. Okay?

I hear something! It's him! It's him! (Man spells in Japanese) (Man speaking in Japanese) Come back! Come back! Hey! Hey! Let's go back! Shhh! I hear something. Ha!! Reiko! Ha!
