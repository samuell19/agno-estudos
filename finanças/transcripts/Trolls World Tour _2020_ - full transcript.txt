And thanks to this silver-haired daddy of mine for bringing me into this world. Oh. I never knew my heart could be so full. Peace and love. Bless up. Tiny and Daddy out. Oh. Okay, bye. Hey, uh, Poppy, there's something I was hoping to ask you. I-I mean, I guess it's something I want to tell you, more so. - Uh-huh. - Uh, but listen. You could feel free to respond to it, uh, with an answer, i-if you wanted. Sure. What's up? Uh, what's up is I, uh, I-I-I-I-I-I... I wanted to tell you that... Uh... You're crushing it at this queen thing. Aw, Branch, thank you. Being a good queen is the most important thing in the world to me. Other than being your friend. Friend, friend, friend, friend, friend, friend, friend. Uh, five it up? Huh. That could've been better. Let's try that again. O-Okay, one more. Huh. For some reason, we can't seem to make a good connection. Oh, yes, Fuzzbert! Now, that's a good connection. Poppy, help! - Ooh. - Poppy! Watch it, watch it! - Biggie? - Oh, run! Help! I'm being harangued by a monster! Someone stop it! Gotcha! Ah! It's in my hair! It's in my hair! Get it out, get it out, get it out! There you go. There you go. Calm down. Who's a good boy? What is that thing? It's creepy. It's scary. And nasty. - Hold me, Daddy. - Oh. "To Queen Poppy." Oh, don't worry, everyone. It looks like it's just an invitation. Whew! Just an invitation. I love invitations. "Barb, the Queen of Rock, "announces her One Nation Under Rock World Tour. "Bring your string to the biggest party the world has ever seen." - Queen of Rock? - It's nothing! It means nothing at all. It's just junk mail. You don't need to worry about it. I mean, quit looking at it, everyone. Forget what you saw! There you go. There you go. Calm down. Calm down. There you go. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm. Dad, what's going on? Well, I have long feared this day would come. I was hoping to protect you from this, Poppy. Protect me? I'm not a little kid anymore, Dad. I'm the queen now. You're right. The truth is we are not alone in this world. There are other kinds of Trolls. - What? - Wow. That's... Dad, that's great. The more Trolls, the merrier. You don't understand. These other Trolls aren't like us. They're different. Different how? Different like Legsly? I love being me. Or Fuzzbert? Or Smidge? Or Skyscraper Troll? Yeah, different like me? No, it's not that. They're different in ways you can't even imagine. You see, we love music with a hummable hook, with an upbeat melody, with a catchy rhythm that makes you want to snap your fingers, tap your toes and wiggle your butt. That's our music. That's what makes us Pop Trolls. - Ooh. - It is. -Yes. But these other Trolls, they sing different. They dance different. Why, some of them can't even begin to grasp the concept of Hammer Time. You can't touch that! ♪ Stop. ♪ How about we break down to a smaller group? It's a story as old as time. In the beginning, there was silence. Boring. Until one day, someone made a sound. Our ancestors were so inspired by the sound, they took six strings. And those six strings had the power to control all music. They could play anything. Techno, funk, classical, country, hard rock and pop. And every kind of music in between. There was something for everyone. It was one big party. Yay! But little by little, Trolls became intolerant of each other's music. I want it! - I want to listen to techno! - No fair! Hey, y'all, I want country. They fought over what kind of music the strings would play. The elders realized there was but one solution. Blah, blah-blah-blah-blah. Agreed. Each tribe would take a string and go their separate ways. Those six tribes have lived in isolation ever since. Techno, Country, Rock, Classical, Funk, and us, the Pop Trolls. Now Barb's announcement makes sense. She wants to reunite the strings so the Troll World can be one big party again. Wait, that's all you heard? - One big party? - Yeah! It's when all the Trolls lived in harmony. And what's more important than living in harmony? Well, I heard fighting. The strings together leads to fighting. Exactly, Branch. That's why we need to keep our string safe. ♪ ♪ Behold! The pop music string. ♪ Oh, yeah. ♪ It's beautiful. And powerful. Which is why we can't let it fall into the wrong hands. And we won't. Not on my watch. What we need is a plan. Don't worry. I've been preparing for this day for years. - We run. - Run? And hide. On it. But we don't even know what we're running and hiding from. We're hiding from Barb and all the other different Trolls. You're assuming the worst about someone you haven't even met. - You're not listening to me. - You're not listening to me. - I'm your father! - And I'm the queen. Uh, father trumps queen. Now, there's no time to debate this. Let's go. Come along, Branch. Well, I, um... We're all Trolls. Differences don't matter. Oh, look how cute you are! Barb is gonna love your new look. Tell her I look forward to helping her plan the world's biggest party. Poppy. - What are you doing? - Oh. Nothing. Ooh! Poppy's busted. Sneaking out to meet Barb? Headed into enemy territory? She's not the enemy. She's a queen, the same as me. Bye-bye, little bat. Your dad just told us that Queen Barb is bad news. Well, my dad doesn't know everything. He knows more about this. You didn't even know there was a string until this morning. He may be fine in a world where everybody lives in isolation, - but I'm not. - Well, but we don't know anything about the other Trolls. Well, we know they're Trolls. Branch, look around Troll Village. Everybody's different, even us. Oh. Did you hear something? Stop trying to change the subject. Look, being queen means having a lot of power, and it's my job to use it for good. I can't stay home when I know there's a world full of different Trolls out there just like us.

Right? Now give me your string. Oh! Oh! No. She took our string. Our-our music. She took everyone. We lost everything. Barb doesn't want to unite us. She wants to destroy us. We need to make sure our own string is safe. Uh, our string is safe. What?! Poppy, are-are you crazy? I thought it was a good idea at the time. I-I can't believe another queen would use her power for evil. Okay. Change of plans. We need to get home as fast as we can and get everyone in the bunker. Uh, no. Change of plans. We have to stop Barb from destroying all music. If we don't stop her, who will? Poppy, you said this could be handled with hugs. How are we gonna hug our way out of this one? - It's okay, Biggie. - Really? It's okay to be terrified? When am I gonna learn to stay away from the cotton candy?!

Maybe all the jazz hasn't left my brain yet. It turns out I'm actually from Vibe City, just like my twin brother. I'm Prince D. What's poppin'? I got a twin brother. How is this possible? Well, it's a very complicated story. When we were both babies, my egg got snatched out of the nest. Mom and Dad looked everywhere, but they couldn't find me, - so you guys raised me as one of your own. - Aw. Now dig this. And then when I went out to go find other Trolls like me, my mom and dad finally found me. Q, is that him? I think our search is finally over. Our son is finally home. I guess it wasn't too complicated. Oh. Poppy, I want you to meet the King and Queen of Funk. King Quincy and Queen Essence. My mom and dad. Aw. Wow, Cooper. You look just like your dad. Yeah, that must be why he's so good-looking. Was that a dad joke? It was lame! Well, so that means you're a Funk Troll? You don't have to be just one thing. I'm Pop and Funk. - Or maybe you're Hip-Hop, like me. - Yeah. Hip-Hop? Yeah. I think your map - is a bit outdated. - Hmm. Oh, he's right. Look at that. It still has Disco. Well, Your Majesties, we need your help to save all music from Queen Barb. If we combine our music, she'll see that music unites all Trolls and that we're all the same and that she's one of us! Poppy, I mean no disrespect, but king to queen, anything but that. Why not? Let's tell 'em how it was, Prince D. Sick. Long ago, our world was without song or dance. Then the Trolls found the strings, and life was one big party. Oh, yeah. I-I've heard this story before. That is, until the Pop Trolls tried to steal our strings. Steal your strings? That-That's not what it said in our scrapbooks. Scrapbooks? Those are cut out, glued and glittered by the winners.

So the Trolls live in isolation because of what Pop did? Pop tried to destroy our music. Just like Barb is trying to do. I can make it right. History's just gonna keep repeating itself until we make everyone realize that we're all the same. But we're not all the same. It's why all our strings are different. Because they reflect our different music. Denying our differences is denying the truth of who we are. I hadn't thought of it like that. Rock has arrived! It's on! Prepare for battle!

I've listened to you and I've done it your way, and now it's your turn to listen. It's time to get back home. I'm not like you. I can't just give up. Give up? I want to protect our friends and family. I can't go home until I've proven myself as a good queen. So that's what this is really all about? Why are you so upset? Because your dad was right and Biggie was right and Queen Essence was right. And I've been backing you up even when you ignore them. But you never listen to me. Branch, what are you talking about? You want to be a good queen? Good queens actually listen. You know what I heard back there? Differences do matter. Like-like you and me. We're too different to get along. Just like all the other Trolls. - We are really different. - So different. - Completely out of harmony. - Completely. I don't even know why we're friends. Neither do I.

All right, okay. I'm listening, Pop Troll. ♪ Oh, yeah. ♪ Poppy, there you are. Hickory! Oh, it's so good to see you. Where's Branch? We had a fight. He's gone. He's heading back to Pop Village. That's a shame. I was so desperate to be a good queen that I stopped listening to anyone but myself. Including my best friend. And it's all because of this stupid string. Poppy, take the string and run as fast as you can, - you hear me? - What? What are you talking about? Trust me, just go. Now! Please! Just go! Hickory, are you all right? I'm fine. Hey. Hey, now! Stop that! Here. Oh, whoa, whoa! Nein! What are you doing, Hickory?! - Quiet, Dickory! - What's going on? - Hickory? - I am so sorry. Yeah. Show her who you really are, Hickory! Wait.

And you've been in back the whole time? Next subject, please. Why would you do this? So sorry. Uh, it was the only way to save our beautiful yodeling. Hickory. But trust me, you need to get out of here right away. What are you doing, Hickory? - Nein! - Dickory. Shut your mouth-hole, please! Let go! - We must save yodeling! - Stop it! - Got you! - I thought I heard a yodel. - Queen Barb. The final notes of Pop. It will never invade anyone's brain again. I'm not gonna let you do this! This is who I've been worried about? This little pipsqueak? I'll never stop fighting until I make things right. - And I'm not a pipsqueak! - Uh, yeah, you are, 'cause I'm, like, a whole centimeter taller than you. No! Leave me alone! Leave you alone? Uh, I'm sorry. You were the one who was all desperate to be best friends. Get your hands off me. Oh, okay. All right. You're feisty. I respect that. Strong woman to strong woman, am I right? But you know who else was feisty? Pop Village. Oh, no. No! Everyone! Everyone! We're back! Oh, no. - Biggie! You won't believe it! - Hello, Biggie. We were attacked by Barb and her barbarians!

I've got to go back. We're coming with you, Biggie. We got to go save our best friend. But how? We'll never make it past security. We'll overpower them with muscles! Or... we could overpower them - with fashion. - With fashion. ♪ ♪ Ouch. Oh. Ooh. Rock and roll! All right, where do we put these things? I need a circuit hookup. Okay, come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Hey. Stop right there. Legsly, I told you not to wear your anklet. Only Rock Trolls are allowed back here.

Being queen can be kind of lonely. Barb! Barb! Barb! Barb! Barb! There's all this pressure to be a great queen. And instead of real friends, you're just surrounded by people who just tell you what you want to hear. You know, other than your terrible taste in music and clothing and general lifestyle, you and me are the same, Popsqueak. Uh... No, we're not. We're both queens who just want to unite the world. You don't want to unite the world. You want to destroy it! Nuh-uh. No way. No. I don't know who told you that. Music has done nothing but divide us.

No. Branch. Rock on! Oh, sick! Totally works. Who's ready to get rippin' tattoos everywhere but our faces in case we still need office jobs? Rah! You're turning everyone into rock zombies? Yep. I can't wait to party with you, Poppy. Rock and roll! Dude. Not so fast, Popsqueak. Hey, boy toy, it's mullet time. ♪ ♪ Who wants to party?! Without smiling. Finish them off. What are you doing? You're supposed to be a rock zombie! Gumdrops. Soundproof and delicious. She learned that from watching me. Give me that! I'm not gonna let you do this to anyone else! A world where everyone looks the same and sounds the same? That's not harmony. Hey, Barb? Hi. Maybe Queen Poppy has a point. If we all look the same, act the same, dress the same, how will anyone know we're cool or something? Yeah. He's got a point. A good point. A good queen listens. Real harmony takes lots of voices. Different voices! Oh. Branch! No. My strings. What have you done? You've destroyed music! Give it up, everybody. Thanks to the Queen of Pop, we've all lost our music. History repeats itself. Pop has ruined everything. Those are my sons. Making music. Queen Barb can't take away something that is inside us. Because that's where music really comes from. It started with the strings, but now it comes from us. Yeah, it comes from our experiences. Our lives. Our culture. Beautiful. Listen to that.

You have to be able to listen to other voices, even when they don't agree with you. They make us stronger, more creative, more inspired.
