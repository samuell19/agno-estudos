Why were you rushing me to meet? Thank you. And why are you carrying a suitcase with you? Angela, I'm leaving. What do you mean you're leaving? Where are you going? What I'm going to tell you is not a joke and I haven't lost my mind either. A double has appeared to me. Out of nowhere. This morning I saw her. She is exactly like me and she's doing everything I have to do. This weekend she has been at my parents' and nobody noticed she wasn't me. And probably she's now at my office doing my job. I'm not in the mood for jokes, Ana. - I'm defending my thesis in two weeks. - Angela it's not a joke. Ok. Really, this is nonsense. Angela, believe me. Yes… And what are you going to do? Are you reporting it or what? No... I'm leaving. What do you mean you're leaving? Where to? I don't know. I'll disappear. From now on I'm not Ana anymore. Are you serious? So who are you then? I don't know. I don't know. "Hostel Ruiz" Yes? Hello, how are you? I came to see the hostel. We talked on the phone. What was your name? Nina. Russian? Spanish. Ah, like my father. What do you do for a living? I've just come into town. Tourist? Dancer. For how long? Indefinite. I mean in the city. Yes. Of course. Ok. It's 40 per night, food included. You pay it weekly. 35 if you pay a month in advance and 30 if it's three months. Come in. Well, I'm Sole. Look, here there's space for 4 or 5 guests. Some of them are just passing by, but normally people stay longer. This is Aziz's room, mine is at the end. I'm sorry but I can't show them to you now. Where did you say you were from? From Barcelona. Beautiful, Barcelona. This is the living room, this one is Pepe's bedroom you will meet him if you stay. And this would be your bedroom. Come in. Sheets and towels are changed twice a week. Is it okay? Perfect. Ok. So, leave your suitcase here if you like. I'll show you the rest. These are the bathrooms. This is for men, and this is for women. The heater doesn't give out much. 5 minutes per shower, but it's cleaned every day. Is it okay? So I'll show you the kitchen. And this is the kitchen. This is Abel. Abel, this is Nina. Hello, how are you? No, he doesn't speak. No, he's not mute. He just doesn't feel like talking. One day he decided he had said everything he needed to say in life, and that most of what he had said was foolish, and he never opened his mouth again. Till now. Where is the remote? Abel if you're not watching it turn it off, I'm always telling you. - I'm fucking starving! - What's up? - Move over. Abel, how are your sudokus? Aziz, this is Nina. Oh man! Nice to meet you. Do you want more bread? No, no. Hide the wine, Pepe's coming. Don't be boring. I'm exhausted. So, what? Are you staying? Yes? Nina. Just a moment. May I come in? Yes. Come in. Tell me. Do you have any clothes from the trip to wash? Just some underwear, but don't worry. Ok, give it to me. I'm going to do the laundry. When you have something to wash, just tell me. Well... Have you made yourself comfortable? Yes. Ok. I'll leave you alone. Ok. Thank you Sole. "DANCER REQUIRED" Are you looking for someone? No. Sparkling water, please. Wanna add some drops of happiness? No thanks. - You can smoke if you want. - No thanks, I don't smoke. Take your glass and come with me. Follow me. When do you want to start? Nobody enters in a place like this looking like you do, if it's not because they're ashamed of their will of working here. Am I wrong? Darling, it's been a long time now. Don't be ashamed! Any experience as a dancer? - I took classes for years. - Bah. That doesn't really matter here. Relax, honey. Here we just love dancing... and living. Nothing else. So, tell me why did you come to this club? - Are you sure you don't want some? - No, thanks. I come from another club. Which one? I'm not sure if you know it. It's in Barcelona. Yeah. Look, this is a Music Hall Club. Why do we call it 'Music Hall'? Because it's inspired by... the 20's glamour of Hollywood, sequins, choral dancers, Broadway..... Ginger Rogers, ‘We want money’... Radio City, New York... New York, New York! New York! Well not really, because... you see, here we are seven. You know... the crisis. Have you ever heard about the Chinese Theatre of Manolita Chen? No. I see. They call me Madame Lacroix. Nina. Please! There are clients! Close the door! - There was a cockroach! - Nobody cleans up here, it's not my fault if they scream! Excuse us. - You have so many photos. - Oh yeah. Before everything was different. There's one with Julio Iglesias over there, and there's another one with the king... I don't know where I put it. Well, let's do the paperwork. Paperwork? The contract. Already? Why not? A dancer left us last week, and I like you. But I almost haven't talked... Better. I do the talking. I love it. Now you have doubts? No, but... for me it's better having a verbal contract... But not for the tax office. And don't address me formally. Do I have to give you my bank account and all that stuff? Well, we could arrange this in black, undeclared... and everything stays between us. If you don't mind... In the end, you're all the same. Give me your ID Of course. Thank you. Girls! Pay attention please! This is Nina. She starts tomorrow. She's replacing Emmanuelle. Let me introduce you to everybody: Dani Daniela. Alexia 'The Skinny' Veronica 'Morte'. The Master, and Gina. - Gina Martorelli. I'm leaving her here. Show her everything. By the way, I've given the second call. - Girls, let's do the dance again. - Hello Nina. I'm the Master. - There's no time! - Just 'The Master'. - Vero, help me with this please. - Come, I will show you the palace. - Sorry! - Hi Nina, I'm Dani Daniela. Welcome. My pleasure. This is the dressing room. You'll get used to it. Thank you Vero. Skinny, yesterday we screwed it up again... and it's the third time. - You're a pain in the ass. 5 minutes! Master! Come. Be careful. It's dark here. This is the backstage. Small but decent. There you have a restroom, for last minute necessities. Matches are always over the toilet. You know. Listen. Can you hear this? The audience. I love that feeling before going on stage. It doesn't matter how many times you do it, you always have that knot. Don't you? Come here. Ok. What a shitty tour I've given you. This is the rehearsal room but it's closed. Ok. Let's go. I have to present! Are you staying to see it? Yes, sure. Break a leg! Break a leg! Break a leg! Thank you, my love. Break a leg! Sit down, lady. What about that wig? You're new at this, aren't you? No. Then it must be the excitement of youth. I have to go! It's my turn! Get out that way. I'll be watching you from stage! - Ladies and gentleman! Boys and girls!... Here we are at Radio City Music Hall... and I ask myself: what are these people doing here... on Tuesday, in a place like this? Nobody works in this shitty country? Nina. Come in! Is everything ok? Yes. It's just that I woke up late. I'm not hungry yet. Are you dying your hair? Yes. It's crazy, isn't it? No... You can look good. Are you sure? It's my first time. Yesterday you arrived very late. I've found a job and I finished late. Oh, that's great. It's difficult to find a job nowadays. Yes. I'm happy. Then... you stay. Well. Here I go. How daring! Oh my god, I'm crazy. - And where is the job? - Soleeee! - In... - Sole, are you making coffee? - Soleeee! - Coming! In a place called... Radio City Music Hall. - What happens there? - Nothing. She's going to work there. - Don't fuck with me. - But as a dancer... right? - What happens? - Nothing. Don't pay attention to this gorilla... as if you didn't go! - Me? There? - Yes! C'mon. Let's make coffee. Nina I put your meal in the fridge. Take it whenever you want. Applause, motherfuckers. Here they were for you, one more night, the Radio City Music Hall girls!

Come on darling, there are more girls... And now the woman who never smiles, the vampire of the place, the woman who will suck your blood and steal your wallet... ladies and gentleman: Veronica Morte! and last but not least the chick from Algeciras: Alessia! Clap motherfuckers! Girls, I'm in a hurry ok? Ciao! Wait! You look like a Picasso. Ok, C'mon clean me up. But hurry up or my babysitter will leave! Close your mouth. - You have a son? - I've got three. ...our international star: Gina Martorelli! I am over-excited Because the day is coming The day I will marry my boyfriend I already have my wedding dress It's made of lace and silk And for the honeymoon Mommy has bought me... vaseline. Everybody says this remedy Is very useful... to walk properly. But I am so innocent That I can't understand What is the vaseline for And where I should put it on. Gentlemen, if you know it you must explain me If I have to use it... on my wedding night. My friends told me Widows and those who are married That if you use vaseline it doesn't hurt almost anything. Yesterday my family said Since I never went to church On my wedding day It wasn't necessary... To fit it all. Nina. Someone is looking for you. For me? No. For me. Tell that person I can't. I'm working. I told him that. But he insists. He is a man. - Veronica, I'm late! - Ciao girls! Careful with the vultures! Honey, you're the new one. What do you expect? If I have to use it... on my wedding night. I was waiting for you. I think you're mistaking me. You know I'm not. Any problem? No. Everything's fine. Ok. Nina, tomorrow at 8. Ok. Ciao Nina. Ciao Marcelo. Nina. Great. Now you know my name. I had already asked for it. Right. The Master... You're new here, aren't you? You weren't in the pictures when we saw each other last day. And you've changed your hair. It wasn't me. I'm still learning. Good night, Marcelo. See you around another day, I guess Seemingly you're known here. - Just wait a little. - It's late. Here you go to sleep late. What are you implying? - Have a drink with me. - I don't drink. I'd like to get to know you. Trust me, I would like it too. - Good night. - Let's have a drink and I'll take you home. Let me go. - I can pay you if you want. - This is how you think you will get me? - I can pay you well. - Let me go! "MISSING PEOPLE" Bullseye! You've made two bulleyes! But she's got an advantage. She's colour-blind! - Master. - Tell me. Can I talk to you? Tell me. The other night, the guy who waited for me... offered me money. He won't be the last one. It's normal. "New toy rustles the dogs". Look, sweetie, you'll get used to it. You never know who he can be... You just have to take the risk. Bullseye! There it explodes. - Look, this girl gets on my nerves... - Don't mind it. - ...take another poster! Nervous for your first show? - The Cantudo's one? - Oh perfect. No. Don't touch the Cantudo. She's my friend. Nina! Yes? For you. Marcelo. Keep it safe. They are like vultures! Don't say that... 15 minutes! Lacroix, I don't want it. Whatever you do out from this club, it's not my business. I have to go. What time is it? 6 o'clock. Six? Yes. I have to go to work. Come here. No. Without the dress. I had a great time. Get dressed. I'm late. Take it. - You know I've always paid you. - Yes you do, but one month, another month... ...the money you still owe me... and then you talk about some guy, then you get in trouble... and I have to put up with everything and you are the only one who pays less here. I'm fed up! Here everybody is doing whatever they want. No. Really. You're leaving. Sell whatever you need to sell... and pay me these two months. That's all I've asked for. - That's all. - But do you think with this is enough? - I don't know! I just know if you don't pay you are not coming back again. That's all! I won't say it again. Because it seems I am your mother! I'm telling you to pay me your debts. That's all! - Enough. - Are you kicking me out? - I don't know. - Do you want me to go? Ok! - No I don't want! - Ok. I go to hell. - No, Enough. I don't want you to go! - How many times have I been there for you... - Leave me alone, Aziz. It's just I'm not a sister of mercy. - Enough. Don't come now with caresses. Then I always feel like the fool one. Leave me alone, don't be silly. C'mon take your things and go! - Good morning. - Good afternoon. You have lipstick here. Bye. I'm going to have breakfast. I'll make it for you. Don't worry Sole. I can make it. No, no. There are muffins in the cupboard. and there's coffee already made. Wait. I'm back in a minute. So, what do you want? It's ok, thank you. - Is this book yours? - Yes. - Do you know her? - No. She had a very interesting life, you learn a lot from those people. Do you want jam? No it's ok like this. Thanks. C'mon sit down. Why is she blessed? Because she suffered a lot. Do you want one? Actually, at the beginning I didn’t like your hair like this, but now I’m used to it. It’s not bad. Thank you. Listen, I want to say sorry for our behaviour the other day, when you told us about working at Radio City. - Nevermind. I had already forgotten it. - No, no, no. Really. Forgive us. You know how Aziz is with women... so cocky... And me... well, try to understand me, it wouldn't be the first time a client rents the bedroom 'per hours', you know? No, Sole, don't worry. But try to understand me. You know that there's always that fear... Don't worry... You know? And moreover having Pepe like that... - What happens to Pepe? - Well, it's hard to explain but... He's ill. Poor man. And why doesn't he go to a hospital? - Because I can take care of him. - Of course. So... how is it to work at Radio City? Fun. You must've seen so many places like that... Don't you? And did Aziz go to see you? What? You know... He's a player with women. - No. Not at all. - Yeah... All women say that, but at the end all of them fall... and then they all go away. So, it's great you're happy working at Radio City. But, you know, be careful. Did you have any problem to take the night off? No. Everything is ok. If you don't want to go, we won't. - If it's something about money... - What do I have to do? Good night. This is Nina. Master. Hi. How did you get in? What were you doing? Nothing. Just wait. Shall we practice? It's late. Smoke a cigarette. You never get out of here? No. I'm kidnapped by Lacroix. But soon I'll escape and I'll be on the news. Do you know I worked at a circus? Really? Yes, I was a ventriloquist. I was so bad. Lacroix threw away my dummy. She said it wasn't glamourous. - What was its name? - Whose? The name of the dummy. Guiomar. Are you happy? I like when people laugh. Why did you start working there? Where did you work before? I don't remember. I like you. How did you do the scars? They are war wounds. How beautiful is this city. But everybody is leaving. And you are not leaving? Maybe. Where to? To Berlin or America. Like everybody. And why don't you do it? Because you can't always do what you want. Tonight you have to do whatever I want. And what do you want me to do? I'm not doing that. - They taste like sulphur. - I told you not to touch the scars. Do not touch the scars. You don't have the balls to go and leave it all behind, huh? Coward. You're a coward. You're afraid of loneliness and that's why you look for me. You know nothing. Now do what I asked you for. I love you. "FOR MY FRIEND ANA SÁNCHEZ HEREDIA AT THE FINAL COUNTDOWN OF OUR AGONY WE'LL GET IT! ÁNGELA. Girls do you know what they told me at school? - Who wants lemonade? Raise your hands! - Me!

Look, they demand you to be perfect: Pretty, smart, efficient, a good daughter, a good girlfriend, a good lover, Hello. a good mother, a good person... Work is essential, love is sole and for a lifetime. I don't know. - Why did you have to talk to the gatekeeper? - What? Now they'll come looking for me. Who? Here we forget all the problems, because problems stay outside, because here we come to enjoy the best dances. What would happen to this country without feathers' glamour? and what would the Mediterranean be... without the curves of our women? And suddenly you realize that... all that is bullshit. That you are dead inside. Dead. Well, gentlemen, without further delay, to all of you, the girls of the Radio City Music Hall! Applause. Fuck! Lacroix, play it! Who are you? Marcelo. Marcelo!

Don't give her more alcohol. Hello? My love. I'm getting into the shower... Give me 5 minutes. We can't go on like this... our worlds are very different and... I don't want to hurt you, and if this keeps going on I will. Now it's better if you leave. We talk tomorrow, by day. But where do you go to when it's impossible to run away? Where to? Where to, Maestro? -Eh, eh! Where are you going? - I need to talk to Ana. There's no Ana here. - To Nina! Leave me your message and I'll pass it to her.
