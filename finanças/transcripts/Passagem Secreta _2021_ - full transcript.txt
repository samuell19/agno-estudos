If so, that's it of sleeping here for you both, got it? Well, now everybody go to bed. Let's go? No, Sófis, I already told you thousand times it's not like this. And I told you thousand times that you are not the guy of the “Do, Re, Mi, Fa…” Fa...? Fa, Sol, La, Si? Whatever. Are we doing this or not? Don't forget to pack your things up. Later, okay? What is this about “we didn't leave here”? Stop it, Murilo. I can't take it anymore. I already told you I stayed home all day. All day? Right. Look, do not start lying to me. Where have you been? Who you were with? Do you thing you can fool me? I'm not thinking a thing. Speak quietly, please. Alice is already sleeping. Now you´ll want to regulate the way I talk. Alice? What? Where are your stuff? Honey, we need to... Come, sweetie. Heitor! Finally! Finally! What is this? It was him again. Hi Alice. Uncle Heitor. Why don’t I remember him, mother? You were sick when we both get there you will understand. Us both? Heitor, I need two minutes with Alice. Were better be going... to avoid the... Two minutes. Honey… That is not what we agreed. Listen. I can't do this, not yet. You need to understand that I... I got to deal with this. You promised. You said you would go with me. And we would go along. Alice. I just need some time to solve some things out over here. I'm trying to do what's best for us. Trust me, honey. Heitor, I don't know if I should… Don't worry, I take care of her, okay? Oh stop it! You always want to be right. You are always the smart one. And you only think about eating! Sofia! You are testing my patience, daughter since yesterday. This way you will be late for school. Come on! Have some breakfast. We'll be right there, mom, nobody will be late. Did you get it? Geez I left it upstairs. Let's go, kids. I'll take it, where did you leave it? It's in Sofi's room On the floor… on the recorder. Alright. Let's go. Come back in here, come to have breakfast first! Ear, where are you? Let's go. Come on, Ear. Sit down. Hungry? A little bit. Is there too much left for us to get there? There is still some road ahead we should arrive in the middle of the night. Listen, Alice. You don't think it was easy for your mother to make such a decision. She should… meet us... I want some bread on the plate. Do you order for me? Do you know where we are going? I wanted to surprise you, we are going to Aunt Lisa's house. Will you enjoy staying with the girls? Yeah. Will you? Yeah? We will eat a lot of tasty treats, we will go for a walk in the park... We will do a lot of cool things. You will enjoy this vacation, okay? Alright? My love. I love you. Are you sure it's not there already with him? Positive. I heard them talking. One of them wanted to see the envelope this morning. Why don't we let this go? What if they catch us? Have you heard what they did to a fifth year kid? But that thing at the lab wasn't an accident? Not accident, it was on purpose. Since when did you got like this? So fearful. They won't even suspect it was us and... I think it's them. Ok, what now? What do we do? Here's the plan... It's coming in after the board bulletin, right? Right. Ahnm do you know who will be doing this next semester? Us, for sure. We talked to the principal and he was very receptive about we continue. Wait, wasn't it a caster scheme? “Was”, got that right. We did a good job. Right. You know, right? The best of the last classes. Yeah, and he had asked us for something special in this last one, He said the result would make sure we kept going. And we did a good job, right? As always. We spent months preparing. There is even a little tribute for him. Because… You know. It's the principal. Yeah. So, now it's nine o'clock. In about few minutes, around ten I release it, okay? What a bunch of dorks! Thank you. Mister, mister, need some help here! They are fighting ugly! What? What? Ouch, ouch ouch ouch. Kids, kids! What's going on here? This little project of anything. But what..? Excuse me? But what is...? No, ow! No! Ahhh! Ow stop it, stop it. Heeey hey. Oww. Hey! Ow, stop it. Ah no, ow ow, no. Here! Let's make it up, give your hand, give your hand here. Friends, little friends. All right. Oh, I'm being nice, that's it or the board. I'm tired of these silly discussions of yours… Who is silly? Do you want to fight too, han? Children! Let's go? Get down. It's going to start. Yeah... I'll drop by the bathroom. Have you lost your mind, man? You will be famous now and so will I. What? We will be famous. This will be the most famous scream of the school. Trust me, what I wrote is brilliant. Ok, ok. Let's hear it. And for our last break before school holidays another program designed by the brilliant second year students: Lucas Host, Ana Rodrigues and Felipa Conde. Come on Sofia, talk. I won't talk to a tape recorder, Vico! You big coward. Now you are going back out? I'm not a back out person. So tell us! Ok, ok. Later it's your turn. My greatest fear has always been my father not coming back from the road... I get so scared that I… That you pee in bed, your mother told me. NO! Which one of you? What? You are crazy? Do you think any of us would do such a thing on purpose? You forgot that everyone said a lot of things and... everybody is listening at this time. Were you without your hearing aid? Wait a minute, you knew. Sofia, stop it! This does not make any sense. Does it? It was you? No. It wasn't me. You are lying. It was you, wasn't it? You listen to me, who came up with the idea of "let's be famous", huh? Who thinks it's super cool listen to yourself all the time until the tape pops on the recorder? I saw you doing it yesterday. And as I remember you both wanted to screw those three anyway. Wait, just us? So you mean this is our fault, is that it? Have you heard about general teasing? Yeah, that's what will happen for the next... Thousand years. I can't believe you did that. The damn tape got stuck. And so you had the brilliant idea to trade for that? Forget me, understand? It's the bedwetter! Why are they standing there like that? I think they got us. You told them too, didn't you? Told what? To who? Them. They are not looking good. They must be leaving now. Guys… You! They are coming. Guys, run! Aaah! Ow... It won't work. No, we got this. Come on. It's not hyper modern cyber but there are a lot of people who still enjoy a playground. But you can't keep it open all year. It does not make a profit. Right. What about grampa? It's weird. I remember all the playground. but I don't remember him. A lot happened before your mother decided to leave, you know? How...? How did he really die? No one knows. What do you mean? One day he disappeared He was off his rocker. But the park is still there. Let's go that the sun is setting. Something about space or I don't know... But we have already done that... We could adapt a book... Hi, mom. You ok? Hi, aunty Laura. You look so pretty today, hah? All good, aunt? What time is this, Sofia? What about you two? Do you have any idea how many times your mothers called here? And look at you! Mom, we had an... extra job at school. Don't you keep saying it's for me... I'm not falling for that one, Sofia! And could you explain to me what is this package that arrived here? It´s here! That´s it! What? What is this? Come, come, come, come... You can stop right over there. Boys, that's fine for today but tomorrow both of you go home. Sofia is grounded indefinitely. But, mom, tomorrow will reopen the park. I don't want A or B. I´ll think of a pretty good punishment for you yet. It's always like this It got a little hotter fly, bee, ants... Ouch! Ready. Let's go! Do you know what this is? No. We have no idea. Because of that you were so excited? Of course! With this it´s possible for us to make the best the biggest the most shocking radio program in all of college history. We can adapt. Are you insinuating anything about my texts? Let me see this. Don´t be silly, you can't even compare. You already heard about that guy, the... the... There was a guy who narrated it and everybody believed in a Martian invasion. Hnm. Who's going to believe in such a thing these days, Sofia? Just do your job well and you don't screw it up. Come here. Here, look, it starts here. Hum The Park! Yeah! This is the Park. I... I remember something, but... Come on in? I intend to reopen it tomorrow it´s still missing a lot of things, but as it´s only at night I can do it on time. How long did you leave it closed? Couple of months. Do you want to look around? I need to get some documents at the trailer. Meanwhile... The park is all yours. Come! I help you. Welcome to Caligari Park! My park, my... fun. Here we have our ferris wheel, electronic entertainment. The spectacular Uga-uga and the thrilling Flying Sharks. I suspect you believe you are facing something usual, something ordinary, trivial, but you are wrong, Alice. Here, the evil part of me, yours, of us all, the evil part is the main guest. It enters, It lodges, It erodes the gears, It takes hold of us, just by letting life be uninhabited by the darkness. Alice! Don't be afraid. Don't just contemplate. Come in, look, watch closely. Alice? Hi Uncle. Where were you? I´m the one who asks you, nobody comes this way anymore. I had almost forgotten about this. What is this place? It is the old machine house. Nowadays, maintenance is made toy by toy, safer, you know? It's getting late, let's go. Lucky you had a spot, right? Because we didn't say anything, we came suddenly, I hope we don't bother. Did we? No, it's no bother, Heitor. Did we? It is just a small room, it was the only one that had vacant. No, no problem. It's the... Alice is calm. Her mother, my sister, she needed to do some things and she will be with me for a while. But she even agreed to work with me in the park and I can't take care of that all by myself, right? It will be ... it will be very fun what we are going to do, Alice. I have a daughter about your age, tomorrow I introduce you to her. Yeah... Oh, by the way, tomorrow... tomorrow, I want everyone at the park. You, better get someone to replace you here because it´s the beginning of vacation tomorrow the kids will pump that park. It will be... It will be very excited. By the way, tomorrow morning, I want to talk to you about that, I was thinking of a little lesson for Sofia. She was up to me again. I was thinking... but never mind. Ahm... come with me and I'll show you to your room. Come on, give it to me. No, that´s ok I can take it. Here´s the key. Come with me. It's Alice, right? This is your room, feel free. And if you need anything I'm in the room at the end of the hallway. Okay? Alice... You will… She´ll come. I know she will. She promised. Honey, come here. Here where, mom? Look here my little girl. Hey! Sofia, this is Alice, she just arrived here at the inn and will be here with us for a while. Hi, Heitor. Hi. Where were you? Ahm... out, right? So, what´s up? Mom, I was seeing something with the boys, I really need to go back... Hang on, daughter. So Heitor, what do you think about that request I made you? Oh yeah, it will be great to have Sofia with us there later. Uhum. What!? Mom. Didn't you say I was “grounded”? No, not grounded, sweety. It´s just that Heitor thought it was a great idea for you to give a help later in the park. A help? Hey, hey. What help? Ah! No worries, you will find out later. Why don't you come here with us? I'm good. Cut it out, come on. Heitor, phone call for you, it's Raquel. What's it? Was she the one you saw last night, Sófis? Is Heitor your uncle? What is your name? Where are you from? Her name is Alice. No matter where she's coming from and yes, it's her uncle. Could you both stop? Tell us. To tell what? Come on. You know they are setting me up. Tell me. You're crazy, girl. I do not know anything. What did you do? Nothing. I did nothing. I doubt you don't know anything. Listen to this, Alice. It will be the best thing you have ever heard in life. The text is from... From H.G. Wells. ...mine. You know what? Let's listen somewhere else. Kids, where are you going? Sofia, you are grounded... And what else you used to do there? No big deal It was like here. Nothing? Like here? What about your parents? I have no parents. What do you mean? My mother said that... Hey, guys! Has anyone seen my hearing aid? Do you use a hearing aid? What? It was back there. Here. He uses and always loses. I do not lose anything. You always lose it. Hi uncle! Hi Laura! We are going to my room. Alice, I need to talk to you. Sofia, honey, come here to help me in the kitchen. Mom! Sofia! Come help me. What is it, uncle? Alice, You know your grandfather and I always stay up very late in the park, right? We didn't even have any more to talk about, so... But there was one night, a while ago, a couple of years ago, something different happened. We were... We finished everything we had to do, We walked down the street without saying anything, in silence, when suddenly something very special happened. Special? Yeah. We found a child alone sitting on an unlit carousel. A child? Did she get lost? No. Soon your grandfather and I realized that it had been on purpose. Her mother had left her there. But she was coming back, right? The mother would not abandon the child ... Do you really believe that, Alice? It´s not so bad. The best part of the story is that your grandfather and I knew that this child had something very special to develop. What is special about being abandoned by your mother? Poor her, that's what it is. It´s not to be sorry for her, that girl was not sorry. Anger, anger, anger is what makes you strong, anger is what makes you move... Alice, pity is a feeling of inferiority, of fragility. What is special has many different forms. Right. What about the child? Alice, I... I need to tell you something. Your mother won't come anymore. She... It's not her fault, she loves you she likes you very much, but she just couldn't. She doesn't come anymore? No. it's not her fault. It is her fault. Or mine. Cause I almost believed it. I really did. I already knew. She is not coming. That makes no sense, her fear. What are you talking about? We agreed. She promised me. Your mother? She is not coming? No, she is not coming. My uncle told me. Listen, I'd give everything to my mom give me a break. She keeps nagging me. You don´t get it. No, I don´t get it. You're here now, enjoy it. Like it's... Vacation! Vacation from your mom. I told you. You don´t get it. Well There are two things you can do. Stay here whining or go with us in the park to have some fun. You choose. That´s right, Alice… I know. I do not care. You have to… I told you I can. I will. Hang on, hang on! What did you bring that for? What do you mean "what for"? I can capture a bunch of bizarre sounds in there. Some popcorn? Did you hear? Popcorn! I did. Look, there is Alice. Alice? But... where is Sofia? Soon we should bump into her. She must be having fun on some toy around. Mom, this is really mean. Oh, you think so? The kids are loving it, Look! What a blooper! Hey, what are you complaining about? Weren't you the crazy one that wanted to come to the park? But not like this, right? Ms. Laura. That is just all I need. Here, look, get it right here! How hard it is to get right here? Come on, you little brat! Eye bent, I doubt you can do it, you're really bad. Yay! We have a winner. Which one will you want? Look it, there is the dolphin… Bu! Wow! Good one. What happened to you? Where were you? No comments. I was "helping" my mother. Never mind. Do you know who's here? Who? You! Run, run... Ow! There, go there... Come back here! Look there, there Let´s get these kids. Damn it! Hey, kids! I knew it was them. This time they won´t escape. Little brat´s mincemeat. You will have to pay for the popcorn here. They will never give up. But what if we split up? I think that's worse cause ... No! It´s not worse. Because if we split up, it's harder for them to find us than if we stay together. True, it will get harder for them to catch us. So we better start now, they are coming over there. Go, go, go, go... That way, that way. There is no one there, ow. They must be at the other side, let's go. Alice. Relax, it must be just for a little while. I don´t want to talk about that. Whatever. No, seriously. It must be all right. I already said I don't want to talk about it. I got tired of this story. Alice? Ah, what is it? Look at this. Sofia? Come back here, boy! I'll get you, kid. I saw him coming here. Man, he can only be there. There's nothing here. I can't believe it, he escaped again? Oh, I got tired of it. Let's go. Help! Somebody help me, help! Help! Help me! Please, help me! No, no, no, no, no, this is not right. No, no, no, no! Almost there... Alice... Alice... Sofia? Change it and come down, daughter, please. What happened, mom? In a minute, honey. Change it and come down, come. So, we are here as a permanent guest of Sr. Luis Claudio this here, since my daughter was born and living... What is going on? The Ear... ...he is gone. Alice? I... I was going upstairs to talk to you. Were you there yesterday too? Do you know the whereabouts of the boy? I don't know, I think... I was with him. But then... there was a moment when we split up. And you didn't see the boy anymore? No. Is this one the niece? Yes, It's her. But she came home with me and she won't know how to tell you anything more than I already said. It seems your uncle... ...he is gone too. Did Uncle Hector disappear too? Kids, go wait there in the cafeteria. I'll talk to the doctor and then we'll speak, okay? And so we can try to call your mother, if you want. To call her for what? It won't do any good anyway. It's not time, is it Vico? Shhh You´ve got to listen to this. Help! Help, please, help me. Where am I? It is dark. Help, help! Please, help me. Help me! How did you record this? It was Ear, sure it was him. How did you... Where did that come from? I do not know, it was yesterday. I got home and started listening to what I had recorded in the park. Then I heard it. I don't know how it got there. Where did Ear get in? And your uncle? Don´t you know anything? I know as much as you do. Guys? What if he is still there? They must have searched a lot, the cops came here. Don´t you think they looked there? No! Vico is right, this is proof, he's still there somewhere. Do I show it to your mother? Maybe she and the cops... Are you crazy? They will think that some of us has something to do with it. We'd better go there and look for ourselves. Ok then. I'm still grounded, let's go out the back. Take it easy, boy. Soon you won´t be alone anymore... Help! Help Help, help. There is no way to get in. Maybe it's a bad idea. Isn´t it better show that recording to someone else, like... Okay, bad idea. Look, now we can't, but at night it gets much darker. We can enter without anyone seeing. Come back here at night? Are you crazy? Do you have a better suggestion? But there is a problem, my mother is watching me hard, I don't know how... And since when you can't sneak out, Sofia? Fine. So we come back here... midnight. Hello? Yes, it's from here. Heitor? No he is not... With who am I speaking? Raquel, Alice's mother? Where do we start? By that corner there. It was the last time you saw him, right? Yeah. Alice? Alice? Alice? Make an effort, Vico. I told you, we split up when he ran out there. I think we are wasting time. Apparently he's not here. Over there! Look! He was around here. Do you think...? He can only be there. There is nothing there. It doesn't hurt to take a look, let's go. Ahhhh! Oh, get off me. What happened? Where are we? What is this place? How will I know? Help! Help, help! Help! Somebody help me! Anyone there? Help! Help! He´s here. Great, there's only one problem: we're stuck. How...? I don´t... I do not know, I did nothing. Of course you did something. This thing wasn't going to open on its own, out of nowhere. This is very sinister. Nothing of what it´s happening here is normal. I'm just trying to help, instead of... Help, Help! Help, somebody help. Someone there? What now? Help! Help! It's very dark in there. He needs help. You can stay there if you want. Guys! There's something there, it could be a way out. Or a trap, right? Can you control yourself? You're making me nervous. Oh Sure! Look where we are, look at our situation, Cool! How do you want to be calm? Look at this place. It looks like... Cemetery. It looks like a cemetery of dead toys. Help! There. There. I heard from there. Let's do like this, we split up, if you find Ear you scream. Deal? Guys? Aaahh! Hey! Sofia? Alice? Someone? Help! Aahhh! Finally Alice you got here. Welcome to the Core! Soon the process will be complete. Uncle Heitor? Where are you? What is this place? Alice, you and this place are proof that your grandfather got it. Got it? Got it what? Mastering, mastering the parts that make us who we are. Awareness. Alice, you are hard evidence and you can't fight it anymore. I told you it was possible, my son. Where are my friends? That is the risk. Your weakness is what prevents complete mastery. He admits no faults, Alice. Your grandfather won't admit failures, your grandfather won't admit failures, Alice. I do not want it anymore! I'm almost done. Your mind is my mind, Alice. Your mind is my mind, Alice. Your mind is my mind, Alice. I don't want to do this anymore. I can´t anymore. There's no turning back, Alice. He already did what had to be done. There's no turning back, Alice... Your mind is my mind, Alice. Isn't it wonderful? Our senses make us realize just a little of what exists, there is so much more. Our physical body is very limited, but I got Alice, you're part of me and I'm part of you. You have done well so far, there is a little left. I... I don´t want it anymore. I have my friends and my mother. You said that... Your friends... your friends, you brought them here. Your mother is fragile, Alice. She couldn't. She already couldn't. Alice! I do not want it anymore. You cannot make me. You didn't understand Alice. If you want to win.... You have to lose. To win, you will have to lose. But don't worry, when it's all over they won't remember, they won't know. When it's all over, they won't remember, they won't know. I need to choose. Raquel, your mother... she is fragile, Alice. Anger. Anger. You need to... There is no turning back You are prepared. Alice... Soon, the process will be complete. I am you. Aaahh! Go, go, go! Come on, come on. Go, it will fall apart. Aaahh! Go, go. Go, Sófis! Let´s go, let´s go. Go, go, go. Go, hurry up Alice! Come on, guys! We almost... have you thought about what you almost got us into? Lucky for you we came looking for you. Luck or bad luck? You guys will mock me forever right? How did you get in there? Even the police were looking for you, Ear. That thing closed, I screamed a lot and... And what? I... I don't remember. Sure you dozed inside. It´s so you to do that. Here, take it. Thanks! Oh man! Look at my mother over there. Mom! Looks like it's not just Sofia who will be grounded this time. What? Just kidding, right? Thank God, I found you... I searched for you all day.. Where were you, girl..? You are cold, honey... Honey? You... you came. Of course I did. I tried to talk to you, but your uncle... I was so worried about you, Alice. You were really? We have so much to talk about. Come. Let's go home. Help! Help! Attention, attention! We interrupt our wonderful soundtrack composed by the excellent Maestro Ludovico for important information. Our planet is being invaded by aliens. I repeat! Our planet is being invaded by aliens. Mommy, mommy, what's going on? Calm down, sweetie. Aliens from the planet... Grotaviski. They are attacking us, they have now reached the radio station. Yes, you heard well, dear listeners, they are unleashing their evil forces here. We cannot fail to thank the sponsorship of the cheese breads at the “Pousada da Tia Laura”, the best cheese bread in the galaxy. Huuuumm Perhaps, dear listeners, this is our last night together, our last radio broadcast. I see them in front of me, they are here! They are here. Aaaahh!
