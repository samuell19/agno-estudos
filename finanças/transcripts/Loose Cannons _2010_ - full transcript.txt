[FIRING] &lt;(Stefania) Teresa! &lt;(Stefania) Teresa! &lt;(Teresa) Here I am. &lt;(Stefania) The room is ready? &lt;(Teresa) Not yet. &lt;(Stefania) Did you prepare the sheets he likes? - Did you remove the curtains from the Luciana's room? - I hadn't time. Change the towels and polish the nice cutlery. Polish them well, with the proper product! &lt;I don't like how Vincenzo's room is arranged. - Stefania! Whose bags are these? - What should I do with that? - Ssh! Traveler coming back from distant lands ... ... What kind of gifts are you bringing with you? &lt;(Tommaso) Madam ... ... I'm bringing you the most fragrant flowers in the garden ... ... The most precious fabrics of the East and a suitcase full of happiness! - Tommaso! - Hello, Grandma! Tommaso, dear son! Let me see you! - Honey! - Hello, Mom. - Well? - Aunty. - You're so nice, Tommaso! Traveller, carried the bags upstairs by yourself ... ... that this happiness weights a lot. - Indeed, you carry them! ...we wanted to take her to the hospital, but Loredana said it was nothing, she is so strong! Luciana, that's the forth glass. I don't count yours. How does the new boxes look like? Are they nice? Grandma, as soon they are ready I'll show them to you. Nicola used to say: "Quality is the first thing ..." "... But then the dough has to be pleasant to see." Uncle Nicola was always right. Especially now with all the competition out there! I think our brand has to be competitive ... Elena, are you teaching us how to run a company? - Good! - No! &lt;(Stefania) No, what? Oh, come on, let them eat. Aren't they cute? &lt;(Salvatore) If I'm not careful, the girls eat me. (Stephanie) they are the picture of health! - You were like them when you were young. - Thanks, Mom. - They are fat. - Actually, last year, they were half the size. - They will slim with the age. - They aren't getting any slimmer, they're fat! Did you take the pills for diabetes? Uncle Nicola always said that people get fat ... ... Just to show they're rich. &lt;Dad, no offence, ... ... A little 'belly has never hurt anyone. Salvatore, please, don't call me Dad. You know I don't like it, you're not my son! And five. Some wine, please, aunty. What did you do last night? Tell me the truth. Yes, yes, ... I still don't believe you... [HORN] What the hell is she doing? Dumbass! No, no, I wasn't talking with you. A crazy bitch was about to run me over. I'll call you back in a while. Anyway, I was not talking with you. [HORN] [VOICES] You can't wait to leave again, eh? At least wait until we sign the papers with the notary. - Then there's the dinner with Brunetti, you know how much dad cares about that. - I know. He wants to introduce th new members to you. Here it is. At that dinner I will make some points clear. There are three things that you don't know. Three, no one less! Ok, let's start with one. The first one is that I never studied Economics in Rome. - I graduated in Literature one year ago. - Then? The second is that I want to be a writer. - You, a writer? - Why? What do you mean? &lt;I have already written a novel. I'm waiting for the answer from the publisher. Anyway, this is not the important thing. The most important thing, Antonio, is that I'm gay. So? You don't say anything? What can I say? Remember my boyfriend Sasa from the primary school? There it is, I'm gay since then. He and I have never played with toy cars. You never thought about it? You never wondered? No. I've never thought about that. &lt;Listen, you really have to tell them? You know how they are. You can easily go back to Rome, spend a peaceful life ... ... Write ... ... And nobody will ever even notice it. - What about the paper signing? Dad wants us to become members. - And you'll sign, who cares! - I don't want such a responsibility. You know what? Thursday night, at dinner, I'll tell everything to everybody ... even to this guy, what's his name... Brunetti ...! Brunetti ... Well played, he's such a a big mouth! Why do you want to tell it in front of everyone? If I tell in front of everyone, Dad will kick me out. I'll pack my stuff, you'll keep all the shares... ... And I'll be free. I have no choice. - And what if he doesn't kick you out? - Then he will meet Marco. Pass the ball! And if he accepts even Marco? I'll write a new novel ... science fiction, this time! Science fiction! &lt;(Luciana) Stop thief! &lt;(Luciana) Help! Stop thief! &lt;Stop thief! - Antonio. &lt;Stop thief! - What? - Did you hear that? - Don't worry. - The thief is back? This is a new one. It's not the same as three years ago. Go back to sleep. &lt;(Giovanna) the thief is back. It's the third time this month. Was it for her, he would be here every night. How dare you? Not every night. He would be here day and night! &lt;(Luciana) Good morning. Can I have a coffee? I should stop sleeping with the my window open. Fifty thousand tears won't be enough because you are a sad music inside me Fifty thousand &lt;You don't know my father. As soon as he finds out I'm a queer, it's gonna be a real mess over here. Anyway, I don't care, I have packed already. &lt;(Mark) Why are you caring? Your life is not over there, it's here, with me. You're right. Marco, can i tell you something? - You make me feel lucky. &lt;Lucky? Yes. I wonder what my life would have been if I hadn't met you. - If I hadn't come to that brunch ... - I know what you mean ... ... and, as usual, you can say it with more proper words. [ENGINE RUMBLING] &lt;Call me later? - Sure. &lt;I want to know. Better, maybe I could leave tonight ... ... So I can get there before you wake up ... ... sit on the bed and watch you sleeping. &lt;Ok, I'll make your coffee, then. &lt;Ok. If I don't leave, I'll call you tonight. Bye. (Brunetti) The policeman says, "It's not my fault..." "... my colleague, that fag, has stolen the gearshift!" [LAUGHTERS] &lt;(Salvatore) You understand? The gearshift! &lt;(Elena) Yes, I understand. &lt;(Salvatore) The policeman thought that the car had no gearshift! Tommaso, come here. This is Alba Brunetti, the daughter of the Commander ... ... Our new business partner. - Hello. - Hello, nice to meet you. Alba! We used to play together when we were children, don't you remember? No, sorry, I can't remember. Never mind, I don't remember you too. - Come, I'll introduce you to the Commander. - Anyway, nice shoes. &lt;Raffaele, this is my son Tommaso. &lt;(Brunetti) Welcome back. &lt;(Brunetti) These kids are the future of the company. &lt;(Luciana) Good evening. (Stefania) Good evening?? I'm your sister in law! Glasses, lenses, surgery, new technologies ... nothing, eh? You already have two glasses in your hands. &lt;(Teresa) Please help yourself. Stefania, have you heard Brunetti's joke about the cop and the missing gearshift? - We are still laughing. - No, what about it? - Raffaele. - (Brunetti) But I must warn the ladies ... ... It's a little bit gross. &lt;(Saviour) Gross? I loved it! &lt;There's a cop ... - A fag cop. &lt;Salvatore, let him tell. - Every night he gets into the car. - He thought that the gearshift ... - Salvatore, let him tell. &lt;(Brunetti) If you want, I'll go on. &lt;(Elena) Please, please. &lt;(Stefania) Go ahead. &lt;(Brunetti) This cop takes the car every night ... &lt;(Salvatore) The car is always the same. - Ok, sorry. Sorry, I just wanted to... - Sorry everyone! - I just wanted to say ... Sorry, Tommaso. I have to tell you a story. - You don't have to. &lt;(Antonio) It's about a boy ... ... Who has always done what his parents wanted ... ... Without ever saying what he wanted, never telling who he really was. That boy had a problem ... ... you'd say a ... defect. That boy liked other boys... What's that? Antonio, you can't tell stories, you are not funny. This guy has kept everything hidden for years. He has been engaged to some girls just to pretend to be like the others. &lt;Then one day in the factory where he worked he found a friend. A special friend. &lt ;Someone who really understood him because he was like him. They used to hang out together &lt;But then our boy got scared. &lt;He was afraid that people began to talk behind his back ... ... And find out what he hid. So our boy fired Michele from the factory. &lt;Do you all remember Michele ... ... the worker in charge of the dough and of the blend? Sorry, Antonio, why we should care about this guy? I wasted thirty years trying to hide myself ... ... because I was afraid of your opinion. Now I finally got the guts to tell you. I'm gay. &lt;(Stefania) Antonio, you are really something! I'm glad you laugh, I couldn't imagine such a reaction. Anyway, did you get it? I'm gay, homosexual, a queer, a fag, "ricchione". Bravo, Antonio you're funny. Anyhow, what're we talking about? I really want to make it clear, Dad. You don't want to understand. I'm sick of hiding. - That's enough, Antonio, stop it! - I can't Mum, that's really the truth. I'm sorry for you all. - Tommaso, sorry. &lt;Raffaele, the contract is okay. You'll go to the notary? What will they say in town tomorrow? In a few hours everybody will know. What will you tell them? Why are you doing this to me? - You know what I'd like to do. - Stop it! &lt;I'd like to call Michele and get him back here. Keep him here with us. Walking down the main street, so everyone can see. Never ever hiding. And you know what I'd like to do? I would love that you get up. Get up! Go to the other room and leave on the desk everything you have in your pockets ... ... Car keys, as well as the office keys and home keys ... ... the credit cards of the company, the checkbooks ... ... the documents, your duties, everything. &lt;Then pack up and leave this house. Better, leave this city ... ... Because I don't want you here. Do you understand? Did you hear what I said? You must leave! Dad &lt;(Vincenzo) Stefania ... ... I want to talk to him alone, tell him to wait in my room. Yes. Excuse us. [DOOR BANGING] He's gone. Somewhere I read that half of th Italians are bisexual. &lt;(Salvatore) Anyway, there are greater misfortunes. Diseases, hunger, famine. Death. &lt;Isn't that true ... ... Dad? - Dad! - Vincenzo! Vincenzo! Vincenzo! Call an ambulance! Why don't they let us in? I want to know how he is. - I want to see Dad. - Don't call him dad. - He's not even here now. - But it bothers me too. [DOOR OPENING] Tommaso. Tommaso. Dad Tommaso, come here! No, here. - Who is out there? - Nobody. - Do people know what happened? - No, anything has been revealed. Your brother got me a heart attack. A light one, I must say. Now try to stay calm. Tommaso! - Who knows about Antonio? - Nobody. - Brunetti said he won't open his mouth. - Yes, Brunetti! - Tommaso! - Ouch! You are the only one left. I lost your sister years ago when she married that asshole from Naples. Your brother did not want to talk with me, now he's dead to me. Tommaso, you are my life, my blood, my breath. You must help me. Will you do it? - I have to go to Rome. - This is your land. This is your home. - Dad, I ... - Just for a little bit. Yes? Yes. &lt;(Marco) Do you know how many gay brothers we know: Mariano and Fabrizio ... ... Roberto and Pino, the lesbian twins. Who cares about statistics on gay brothers? Come on! &lt;Look at the bright side. Someone has opened the way for you. - Now the family knows the topic. - Even too well! Are you stupid? What the fuck are you saying? My father ended up in hospital because of a fag son. If we get to two, we'll send him to the grave! Plus, as if that weren't enough, Antonio doesn't answer the phone. &lt;Leave him alone for now. Just try to get yourself out of this mess. &lt;Tomorrow we'll see the carpenter. - Oh. &lt;I can not sign the contracts alone. Yes, I understand. I'll call you back, I can't talk now. Hello. What are you doing here? Teresa didn't tell me you're here. Anyway, my father is feeling better. I know already. - Shall we go? - Where? In less than a month the new line will be launched on the market. You have to decide the campaign and control the distribution. We're late with the production of the special format. We are remaking "the crazy wheel", the shape invented by your grandmother. What it has to do with me? Oh God, watch out! Fucker! - You must replace Antonio. - No way, I don't know anything about these things. You are studying BA in Rome, you will have learned something, won't you?! (Alba) We have invested a lot of money in this business... ... Your brother is gone, your father is in hospital ... ... You're the only one left! The 27x6 format is fine, but you must darken the color. We don't like this shade of brown. - Right, Tommaso? - Antonio didn't want to darken the color. Antonio quit the project, so now it's just me and him. Is it clear? Tommaso, am I right? - Tommaso. - Huh? &lt;(Alba) Ok, whatever... Anyway, the new formats must be ready in three days. &lt;(Luciana) Stop thief! Stop thief! &lt;Help! Stop thief! &lt;Stop thief! &lt;(Teresa) Giovanna, have you heard the mistress? Come! - Mom. - There is nothing, no evidence, nothing. - What are you looking for? &lt;I don't believe that your brother is ... ... What he says he is. I'm his mother, I would have noticed. It can't be true! I raised him, I have always been with him. Not even a clue, never. You know what's the only explanation for this, Tommaso? &lt;He didn't tell us the truth. &lt;Maybe he just wanted to leave for another reason. How can we possibly know? &lt;That's the only explanation, he lied to us. - Maybe you just never noticed. How can you say so? Are you a mother? No, so? That's him. Michele, the guy who worked at the factory. &lt;When you were kids ... ... We were used to go for a swim to the Bay of Turks, remember? &lt;One day, it was August ... ... Antonio went among the trees ... ... And he made me a basket with the leaves for me. A basket with the leaves... It's a girly thing, isn't it? Mom, it wasn't Antonio. It was me who made that basket. Ah. - Vincenzo, I found the evidence. - What evidence? At the very last. I was about to give up, instead.. I guess there's nothing else we can do. What a shame! I could never imagine it was going to end like that! We will be the talk of the town! Your mother promised, she won't say a word ... ... but, you know, she's a loose cannon. I told everyone he left for personal reasons. We hid everything to us, he has been good at it. All these years spent together and not even a clue. Remember that time we went to the Bay of Turks all together? - What? Bay that the Turks? - Yes, you told me about that. - Antonio we made a basket for you. - It doesn't matter. Forget it. - Are we late? - No. [VOICES COVERED BY NOISE] [VOICES COVERED BY NOISE] &lt;(Teresa) ...don't worry, she won't say a word. - She doesn't even understand what happened. - You must keep silent ... ... Or I'll fire you. I saw you talking with Rosetta, the Ferrara's maid. We were talking about our own business, just to kill some time. Listen to yourself! How dare you! You are not supposed to waste time, you have to work. I'm not paying you for sitting idly by like that. - Scram! Go cooking some rice and chicken. - Wait, call Massimo.. ... I want to go out. - Where are you going now, Mom? I want to see Vincenzo ... ... And then to the factory and see what happens without Antonio. Mom, Tommaso is in charge. He's taking care of that. Vincenzo must rest. Tomorrow, if he is still there we'll go together. - Vincenzo cannot really accept it, eh? - Listen Mom, the less we talk about that the better. The doctor says he needs to go back to normality as soon as possible. Normality ... what an ugly word. He was everything I had, a part of me! Like one of my arms, one of my legs. - He was like me, only younger. - (Patrizia) I know, I know. He should have loved girls just like I do. Sure. If I think he could be with another man, I can't take it, it blows my head. - Listen, it's plenty of them out there! Your son is not ... - Shh! [NOISE] Look at the bright side, it could be worse. - Sometimes, even in the same family ... &lt;Really? A friend of mine knows a woman whose nephew and even her son are gay. &lt;Patrizia, I don't care about your friend! - They're everywhere. They spring up like mushrooms. - Madam, the five minutes are over. - Just a moment. - Okay. - Thank you. There are so many of them with even a wife and children. Yes, but at least those ones do their business quietly ... ... Without telling anyone. Now, how can I go out there? How can I face people in the street? - Don't worry, nobody knows! - Yes .. nobody! I must go now, it's late. I'd like come to your place with you. Don't worry, you'll come as soon as you get better. Just be patient! Thank God I can count on you and Tommaso. Tommaso and me. - How would I do without you two? - My Beautiful! - How do you feel? A bit better, still weak. This room smells of bitch... [WHISPERING] Is it running? It doesn't seem working well. It works, it works. - The needle is well in place? - Yes. - Aah! - Now it is. Now you can eat rice and chicken, both unseasoned though. I'm not hungry. Nurse! Are you angry with Antonio because he never tell you before? No, I'm not angry. I just didn't image it could have happened like that. You two never talked face to face ... ... about this thing? What? About ... this thing. My brother and I haven't talked much in the last years. - Too bad. - What? It'd be easier if you were the two of you. The two of us? What do you mean? You know what I meant. Grandma, what are you doing up so late? I'm worried. About what? Nothing, nothing ... You took your pills? - Have you seen the new machines Antonio bought? - Yes. Did you know about Antonio? Did he tell you? When he came home from the factory he was always smiling, happy ... ... But that could not be enough for him &lt;Yes, he did tell me ... ... But it wasn't really necessary. &lt;Back in my days we manually packed the dough inside the boxes. I sat among the others and I packed for hours and hours. And I wondered: "And now?" "Where is this box going? Who will eat it..." "... This dough I've been touching with my hands, I've been helping to prepare?" &lt;Have you ever touch the dough when it comes out from the machine? No. It's warm, soft. Nicola sometimes touched it and suddenly he started to laugh all alone. He knew that dough very well. We had built everything together. Tomorrow I'll go to the factory, and I'll touch the dough too. No, don't touch it. Tommaso ... ... If one always does what the others want ... ... Then it's not worth living. - Good morning, Mr. Cantone. - Good morning. Tommaso, eh? - Raffaele! - Vincenzo, how are you? - Fine, how do I look? - In perfect shape! See? Tommaso and Alba are doing a great job. - They are really strong together! - Dad. - A force of nature. - Drink something with us? - Thanks, already done. - I'll call you later, we need to talk. - Bye! - Tommaso, come. There. Sit down. What are you laughing for? What? Something wrong? No, nothing. I have just a lot of things to do. Alba is waiting for me. It's good you care about the job, but not now. Now you're with your father. - How is it going with Alba? - Fine. Such a beautiful girl, huh? She is so firm. She has never been engaged with anyone. A girl like that! Maybe she is just looking for the right man. Good for her. &lt;Here it is. - Good morning, Mr. Cantone. - Good morning. - So ... ... What would you like? - Something light, non-alcoholic. - No, no, no, no we take a nice bottle of champagne. Champagne, I see. - You want to celebrate! - Why? - What's wrong with that? - Nothing. - What's wrong? - Normally people take champagne because they want to celebrate. - Exactly. - Yes, please bring us a bottle of champagne. - Any preference? - I trust you. - Champagne. - Go! - Dad. - They all know. Everybody knows about that. - What are you doing? - Everybody knows! They know ... - Shall we call a doctor? - No, I told you, it's nothing. I told you not to go to the bar in the sun. Dad, come on, let's call a doctor so he can check the blood pressure. Again, I don't need any doctor! All these worries make me sick, that's the problem. &lt;Antonio was such a disappointment. I'm ashamed. I am ashamed of you, Vincenzo. &lt;I can't go out anymore. I shall live locked here inside like a prisoner. &lt;I can't even think about it. Have some rest, uh? Take a rest! Yes, Dad, take a rest. - Tommaso. - Huh? - Come here. - Dad ... &lt;Come! Come on, dad. It's really becoming an obsession! - You'll see that eventually you get used to it. - I can not get used to it! I will never get used to it! How come we never even noticed it? - They don't usually write "I'm homosexual" on their forehead. - Omo ... what? He is a fag! Don't even try to justify him. I don't understand how we couldn't notice it. Normally you can easily spot them from the way they speak, the way they move ... ... the way they walk. Instead he didn't even give a sign, he dressed well ... normal. ... Just to hide everything to us. You don't have to dress like a woman to go with men. And how do you know that? It's... common knowledge. - You knew it, didn't you? - If only I had known ... I did not know, I swear. Why, why! [VOICES COVERED] [HORN] &lt;(Tommaso) We often stay at home. &lt;Sometimes our friends come over, sometimes we are alone. I read or write while Mark studies. Sometimes when I'm here ... I image that he appears. ... Suddenly, in the street. In Rome he always walks in front of me as he walks faster. So I stop ... ... and I start staring at him. ... How it moves his shoulders ... ... How he disappears into the crowd, alone ... ... As if I weren't there. I don't know why but that makes me moved ... Until he notices, then he turns and smiles at me. I stop staring at him, I make two quick little steps ... ... And I get to him. I know, the verbal agreement we had was different ... ... But there's no way we can deal with it again. - You can't take your word back. - A word is a word, it's not a contract. - We changed our minds. Did you talk with Sergio? - Yes. - Helen, don't you say anything? - Why? Can I talk? - Of course, what are you doing here otherwise?! - Dr. Mancini ... ... There's no time to negotiate now. Within two weeks we must be ready with the production. Let's sign a contract now so that the production won't stop ... ... And we will take account of your new requests. With all due respect, she has no decisional power in this company. - She has it from this very moment on. - What are you doing? Are you Working with us? - Yes. - Ah. - And the girls? - Huh .. &lt;(Luciana) Now go down there. Walk right, cross your legs. &lt;You have to cross your feet. Eh! Stand erect! &lt;You have to be more erect. The neck! The neck has to be well erected. Oh, whatever. What are you doing, Aunt? Er ... COUGH I'm coughing. - What game are we going to play, Aunt? - You ever sleep in the afternoon? Can we playing with bread and jam? You have a terrible cold, let me hear the cough. [COUGHING] That's a terrible cold! Now Aunty gives you something that will make you immediately feel better. This will fix everything. - Yummy! - It's yummy, isn't it? How old were you? Fourteen, when the disease began. My father was never at home, I had the keys. ... And I had to do everything all by myself. Cooking, looking after her ... ... Studying, everything. Mom didn't want anybody else around but me. At the end she was so sick that I hoped she died ... ... She died soon. I thought it would have been better for her and me. But I was wrong, really wrong. When it happened, it was my last year of high school. I remember I used to come back home. ... And I didn't know what to do. I opened the door and there was nobody, nobody waiting for me ... nobody taking care of me. ... Nobody who really cared about me. I'm tired. See you tomorrow. Yes. - At 9? - At 9. Good night. &lt;(Antonio) She likes you, doesn't she? She never let me in. Have you ever cared about anyone as he were a part of yourself, a leg, an arm? Otherwise you could not understand what I did. I care about Michele as much as I care about this hand. Of course I understand I left because I wanted him back, I wanted to tell him that I did it. I put him through a lot of things. I fired him from the factory to avoid people might know ... ... I settled him into a house outside the city ... So we could secretly meet. He had a surgery, he was sick and I couldn't go to see him. He said it's too late, he doesn't want to see me anymore. I'm sorry &lt; You're sorry, that's all you got? Are you filling the books you write with these bullshits too? - It's your fault. - My fault? &lt;Yes, yours. I've been stuck here for years trying to hide ... ... Because you had to study in Rome and in the meanwhile you were living quietly ... ... Minding your fucking business. Go ahead, suit yourself. You move to another city, just like me. You find two or three friends to talk to about how you feel... ... You find someone to love ... ... Among thousands of people around you who don't want you. You cry, you suffer ... ... Secretly. Anyway, if it was just this you could have talked to me ... ... Instead of leaving me alone in this mess. - Who is stopping you? Tell them! You tell them too, do you want to go away? Tell dad that Cantones will end with us ... ... That our name will not continue. - You have to tell him. - Don't touch me! You sent him to the hospital, what should I do? Killing him? Michele has all the reasons not to want you back you have no mercy for anyone, neither for your brother. You have to be stay all alone like all those who only mind their fucking business. Oh! What the fuck are you doing? They started to take our dignity inside the family. We have to steal things one at a time. We must fight among brothers because what is given to one ... ... Is taken from another one. I had to earn this piece of life ... ... Be it good or bad. I won't turn back for anyone, not even for you. &lt;Good morning, Tommaso. Good morning, Grandma. What's up? Always remember one thing. The lords always get up later than the peasants ... ... But always before the slackers. - The real lords are hard workers. &lt;What time is it? - I'm still in time to be a lord today? &lt;Yes .. ... But only because I have woken you up. Five minutes and I get up. I'm not buying it, you had dinner with her again last night? - Daddy ... &lt;Don't get me wrong, that makes me happy. - But we are a behind with the work. - You're right. - Things were better when Antonio was here. - It doesn't matter now, he's gone. - He was here yesterday. - Where did you meet him? How is he? - He left this morning. &lt;(Vincenzo) Mom! How do you know that? What are you plotting? - I am preparing an attack. - I don't wanna know why he was here. &lt;If he changed his mind ... ... It's too late! - What shall he repent about, Dad? - It is not a sin to be homosexual! It's not his fault. - I do not want to hear this word. It's a word like any other, you'd better get used to. No! The cake is bad for the blood sugar. Are you still here? Scram! - Dad, I think Antonio has to come back here. - Are you insane? It's the same person as before, the same son you raised. Let me get it straight ... ... You think your brother is the same person as before? Yes, it's the same person. You're getting late for the factory. Scram! You are the one who can't understand. It's more difficult to shut up than saying what you really think. Don't you think I'm missing him? &lt;I always think about him. &lt;When he needed me ... ... If he got sick, I was sick too! I can't find that Antonio anymore. Thank God, that means he saved himself. - Elena? - Yes I'm gay. Homosexual. - I know, I knew it. - You knew? - And you didn't tell me anything? - What should I have said? Ehh. .. Antonio likes men, you too. I've been thinking if I could like women but ... No, I don't like women. I'm not gay. Ok, well. - Tommaso? - Yes. Are you happy? Mah. The mad wheel. Nicola and I were used to make our own wheel with that. We wanted to make a dough better than Cavalieri's ... ... But we never succeeded. You never meet Nicola. Your brother in law? Yes, the brother of my husband. &lt;I spent with him all my life. He was with me even when he wasn't there. In my head I slept with him and with him I woke up in the morning. I've never stopped loving him for all these years. It was wonderful, but unbearable. &lt;When a love is impossible, it never ends. Those are the ones that last forever. Stefania, I'm sure. They're all watching us! - Vincenzo is right. - It's just your impression. - Hello, how are you? - Very well, thanks. - Yes, they are definitely watching us. - (Stefania) I know why. This morning I found a bottle of liquor completely empty. - You can't even walk straight. - No, It's not because of that! It's the other thing ... No! Antoinetta No! - Good morning. - Oh, Mrs. Cantone! - How are you? - Very well, thanks. - How can I help? - We're looking for a suitcase. - What color? - Undergrowth wet green. - Another color? - Raspberry. - Yes. Mrs. Cantone! Luciana! I thought I saw you! - How are you? - We are very well, thanks. And you? What a pleasure to see you! You hear some gossip and instead ... ... Here you are, beautiful, blooming and smiling! Thank you, you too. Have a nice day. I just wanted to tell you that my son Luigi is getting married next month ... ... And we will make a big party. I wanted to tell Antonio, they were friends when they went to school. I'm so happy. When sons get married it's always a pleasure! We'll tell him. Goodbye, have a nice day. [HUMMING] What a surprise, Antoinetta! I didn't realize, Luigi is getting married! How nice! - With Catherine! - Yes. - Jesus! He's marrying the "Free Beach", so they used to call Catherine, remember? Because everyone went there and stuck his umbrella. People is always bad mouthing, how awful! Yeah. Nothing is worst than calumnies. Goodbye. - Bitch. - Slut. [Sighing] Can you see the tension I'm carrying? I'm all screwed up. (Patrizia) Here is very tense. Relax, Vincenzo. &lt;With this shame I'm carrying? &lt;I walked all the streets looking at the ground to come here. Oh come on, don't exaggerate! - And now Tommaso is defending him too! - What else is he supposed to do? - He's still his brother. - That guy has always been too good. Sometimes I really have the feeling he's trying to put himself in Antonio's shoes. &lt;he strives to understand him ... how can he do that? Maybe, since he studied in Rome he's used to see them. You know! Big cities ... - Who? Tommaso? - Yes, Tommaso. You don't know him! Tommaso before this brother thing ... ... he didn't even know what they were! [MUSIC] [COVERED VOICES] - What did those two assholes tell you? - Who? Nothing. They told you I'm crazy ... ... That I've been in and out from the clinic? - Actually we were not talking about you. They told you I'm sick, rich, spoiled ... ... I do strange things, that no one here can take me anymore. What are you talking about? What's the matter? They are right, it's all true what they say here in Lecce. Haven't you noticed how weird I am with all my obsession? Alba, You're completely wrong. But it's true, I'm weird. I can not get close to the others, I always hold them off. And I have a lot of obsessions too. Good night. Good night. [LAUGHTERS] (Luciana) You must be tired after this long trip ... ... Do you want to take a shower? &lt;No. I'll tell the maid to call Tommaso. Teresa! Tommaso! &lt;(Vincenzo) You've seen what a surprise? Your friends from Rome! &lt;They missed you. We just wanted to say hello, they were about to go to the sea ... ... And then they told us come up. &lt;(Tommaso) What a big surprise! - Hello, handsome. - Hello. - What have you done? Look at your face! - No, I was sleeping. - Hello! - Great, Tommy! - Hello. I need some water. &lt;(Luciana) So you are ...? &lt;I am Davide. &lt;I am Andrea. - Yes, I remember. - And you are...? &lt;(Stephanie) Tommaso's aunt. Luciana. Call me Luciana &lt;(Luciana) Mom, did you see how nice these guys are? Are you from Naples too? When did you go to Rome? I also lived in Rome before getting married. &lt;Did you know Gennaro Capece? - No, I don't know. - Oh that's impossible you don't know him! He has a very famous pub in Rome, ALTRAS, ALIAS, something like that. &lt;(Marco) The "Alibi"? &lt;(Salvatore) Exactly. See how small the world is? - We have friends in common! Such a big city but still we have friends in common. - I see, I see. - Anyway I'm Massimiliano. - Salvatore. - I'm Elena, his wife. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Sorry, we should go now. No! Are you kidding? I'll call those slackers and make them prepare a nice dinner. - We really must go. - We just swing by ... ... we wanted to go to the beach in Gallipoli for the weekend. You can go to the sea here, there is a lot of space! Tommaso, you have such nice friends in Rome! - I already like them. &lt;(Stefania) Teresa! Teresa! Here I am, as fast as I could. Take the meat off the freezer and grind it twice. Chop four onions in very thin slices, you understand? &lt;Peel fresh tomatoes and then I'll come. Go to Renato and take six, no eight chickens. If he has mushrooms, take mushrooms. And take out the cheese so it gets some air. Now you make a nice creamy coffee with cookies. Clear? &lt;(Teresa) Giovanna! No, no, they didn't even noticed. "You have such nice friends in Rome!" - "You can go to the sea from here." - "There's a lot of space here." One night in Naples with the moon and the sea I met an angel who couldn't fly anymore. One night in Na.. I took the towels. "I took the towels." Today we celebrate San Ramiro. I made a commitment, I have to go to the factory. - My father is not fine yet. - Why do you care so much about the factory? &lt;You care only about writing before, that was all you wanted to do. - Those were the important things, not the dough. - They still are. - Now I have to spent some time with them. - What are you looking at? Nothing. - You're afraid of us, you are ashamed. - I am not afraid of anything ... ... And I'm not ashamed. They just see things in a different way than us. I'm spending my days talking about my brother ... ... And if you are here it's a mess! - This is the only thing you want to talk about ... ... since we saw last time? - You have no idea of what can happen. - And what can happen? They discover that your friends are gay! And then? We are in 2010! Indeed, we are no longer in 2000. &lt;I just wanted to see you. It's not my fault if your family is holding us. Se poi strappo un tuo lamento é importante questo mio momento perché io ti chiedo ancora di abbracciarmi ancora &lt;Stop it, it's a super fag song! &lt;That's what you think! Go away! ANDREA SINGS "THE WAY WE WERE" GIOVANNA SINGS "THE WAY WE WERE" Who is she? Oh God! Where is my lens? Give me some pastries, two cakes and one profiteroles. Some friends of Thomas has arrived from Rome and I want to celebrate. - I'll take care of it. - How are those friends? Nice and handsome. - What's wrong with this shirt? It's perfect. - Come on, take that faggish off. - It's perfect for summer. - Come on, change it! You know what are you doing? You'e blocking my freedom of expression. We have to do it, because you are the one most at risk. - You are always gesturing... Tie your hands! - You are the one at risk. If you've taken something, God knows how it is gonna end tonight. - Davide, please behave, ok? - Stop with this story. I haven't taken anything since... I don't even know when! Such handsome guys, even sporty. If I don't tell them I'm gay, they don't even notice. I must warn you, keep your daughters well locked tonight ... ... Because I know they want to go out and God knows what they're gonna do! I saw how you were staring at Tommaso's brother-in-law. - Are you insane? &lt;One minute more and you'd have jumped on him, darling! And I would be the one at risk? Don't tell them you are a steward otherwise they immediately understand. - There are plenty of heterosexual stewards! - Yes, the hostess. - The lawyer is speaking! - Yes, I'm a lawyer, and so? Listen, f they call you "the prince of the forum", it's because you are a good lawyer! [in italian forum = hole...] Why are you always look so angry? - I'm not angry, that's just my expression. - Something to drink? - Please have an aperitif, huh? - No, if I drink in the evening ... ... My belly swells and then I can not fit the swimming suit. But I guess I can make an exception for this evening. After all, a belly is always sexy, isn't it! - You also study Economics? - Why, who else studies economics? - I study Economics. - Sure, we all know. - I study Medicine. - Ah! - So, how did you meet? - At "The hole". - What? - What? - Mutual friends. - Mutual friends! - And what about you? - I work in marketing for a multinational. - I am often in London. - London! Oh, I loved London! &lt;I had been living there for long time. - Luciana. - For a while ... - Luciana! - A wonderful time. - Forget London, please. I work for an airline. It's nice, I travel a lot. - And you? - Me? in a factory, as a storeman, but you know that aunt! - No, not you Salvatore, I meant you... - I'm a lawyer. - Seriously? I'd have bet you're a coiffeur, a stylist. - Miss Brunetti is here! An announcement, like we were at a fancy dress party! - Good evening, sorry I'm late. Hello, Tommaso. &lt;Hello. - Thank God you came. &lt;(Andrea) Alberta? - No, Alba. I mean the dress ... Alberta Ferretti. Ah, yes! - Terrific! - Thanks. - My girlfriend has the same dress and so ... - Ah! What a nice dinner! We really needed it! &lt;(Salvatore) But I still miss Rome! - You can leave anytime. - And I'll pay for the ticket. &lt;Dad! &lt;(Stefania) Why don't you stay here for a couple of days? So Tommaso can work and you can go visiting around, swimming... - ... There are plenty of beautiful girls here. - If there are girls ... - No? &lt;(Salvatore) And you mus have dinner to our place too. And for such an event I'll cook, deal? - Terrific idea! &lt;My husband can't do anything. He's bluffing, talking is the only thing he can do. &lt;(David) What about you, Tommaso, how are you doing here? Tell us. &lt;(Tommaso) There are a lot of things to do at the factory. Sorry, there was a mosquito. &lt;(Tommaso) Thomas now has a lot of responsibilities. - You know that we have a factory? - Aunt, more on the right. And it was built more than 50 years ago by my mother and uncle Nicola. Oh my God! &lt;(Davide) Sorry. After all, it went quite well. - Yes, just too bad for the neon light. - Neon light? The one on your forehead, saying "fag! fag! fag!"! Guys, what the fuck are talking about! I have been good, they didn't notice! You should keep those hands in your mouth. Listen to you! You were about to doing it under the table with the brother-in-law. Did you see how cute he is? I tried not to look, but he's so cute! - And you, with that glass! - Let it drop, why did you care so much. I know, I know, but it wasn't me, she's the real me, I try to hold her back ... ... But ... puff!! ... she has to come out anyway. Anyway, don't worry 'cause she is now locked in the car. And I'll let her out only once back in Rome. - Oh, sorry. - Davide! - You can't sleep? - I was looking for the kitchen, I'm thirsty. Here you can find anything you need. - No, thanks. - Come and sit here. Come. &lt;(Marco) Tommaso! &lt;Tommaso, it's me, Marco! Sorry. London! How much I loved London! You can't image how it was 25 years ago! I run away to go there. I liked a boy, my parents didn't like him. He wanted to play in a band, but he couldn't. So I took money, credit cards, everything ... ... And I ran away with him. Then one morning I woke up in the apartment ... ... And he was gone. &lt;He left with the all the cash ... ... And a few jewels I had brought. He left the bills to pay, he also took the ID cards. Vincenzo had to come to get me back. I had so much fun! - Come on, have a drink! - No thanks. The good guys! - So boring! - No, I'm not a good guy. I prefer other things. Ah. That don't even make you fat. Like? I'm tired. Tired of whom? Them? Of everything. You are really ugly! I love you too, ma'am. Good morning. Good morning. Listen ... ... I wanted to ask you something, something personal. Tommaso told me that you are very close friends. He told you about Antonio? - Yes, he did. - Perfect. I just wanted to ask ... ... According to you, as a doctor ... ... Is it something you can recover from? - From what? - This thing ... Antonio. - From homosexuality? - Yes, that thing. Maybe... as the time goes by... - No. - No? It's not like a disease. - It's a feature. - A feature? - Yes. You can be gay or not. Yes, sure. I know. But no one has ever come back? Normalized? - Normalized? - Yes! I have two bags under the eyes I look like a panda. - No, it does not normalize, maybe it gets worse. - Tomorrow I'll throw in the toilet all those creams! - Good morning. - Good morning, help yourself. &lt;(Teresa) Ma'am! Mrs.Luciana has turned upside down the entire cabinet. She says she wants to make the change of season. Last night she didn't sleep at all! - Excuse me, my sister-in-law is not feeling well. - I don't know what's wrong with her, she is completely upset! &lt;Not like when she is drunk, much, much worse! I didn't give anything to her, I swear. [RHYTHMIC MUSIC] [VOICES INAUDIBLE] - If they didn't connect the water? - We won't wash. If doors and windows are not ready? If they are not ready, we let the wind in ... ... and if even the bed is not ready We lie on the floor. [VOICES Inaudible] - And if there's no ... - If there is nothing neither the walls ... ... I'll take you to the new house, I'll lock you in and I won't let you out. [referring to Salvatore] Passive, he's definitely passive! - Not to mention his wife and the daughters. - It doesn't mean anything! - There are passive and liars. - He just doesn't want to admit. Look. I have something for you, it arrived at home. Is it from the publisher? You've read it already? Yes, I wanted to give it to you before but then ... I'm sorry. Never mind. - Hello! &lt;(Alba) Have a nice trip. - (Radio) One night in Naples With the moon and the sea What about this book they don't want to publish? It's about two people who are not longer together. One is suffering and the other one is not. But maybe what it is really about ... ... Is not to be afraid to leave ... ... Because all that really matters never leaves us ... ... Even when we don't want to. So in the end ... ... we don't leave anything to anyone? Yeah. That's a real swindle! - See you later. - Wait, Dad. - There's something I want to say. &lt;I said later. Tommaso, don't say anything. I tried my best, I go to the factory every morning ... ... I work, I touch the dough like grandma says ... ... I see the boxes taking off for the whole world ... ... But it means nothing to me, I can't feel it. Do you know what I do at night while you are asleep? I write. &lt;The things I see, what I think, what I would say ... ... they all become true. I can show what I really feel ... ... in a way I'm not able to do in person in the real life. &lt;I'm not able to express myself. &lt;When you ask me a question, I would like to reply ... ... "Wait, I go in the other room to write it, so you can read it and understand me." &lt;So I can better express myself. That's what I want to do in my life, I want to write. A few days ago in Rome I got a letter. They won't publish the novel I wrote. They don't like it ... ... But I don't care. I'll write another one and yet another one. If they don't publish them, I'll keep writing for me. Here, I have told you. That's it. &lt;(Stefania) Tommaso. &lt;(Tommaso) Wait a sec, let's talk about it. About what, Dad? &lt;There is nothing to say, that's all. &lt;See you tonight. Teresa! Teresa! [FOOTSTEPS] Tell Massimo to get the car ready. Where are you going? Am I supposed to ask your permission to go out? &lt;Good morning, Tommaso. Good morning, Grandma. &lt;Did I wake up late like a slackers? No, you woke up at the right time. You've been brave to stand up like that. Always try to make mistakes on your own. Is that how lords do? Forget the lords. That's what people do in order to be happy. Good morning, my love. [INDISTINCT VOICES] What's going on? [PEOPLE MOANING] Tommaso ... &lt;(Grandmother) I wonder if these places will have memory of me? &lt;If the statues, the facades of churches ... ... will remember my name? &lt;(Tommaso) I want to walk one last time down these streets ... ... that took me in many years ago. &lt;(Grandmother) When everybody used to call me the "Tuscan". &lt;I want to see the yellow stones. &lt;(Tommaso) All that light that takes your breath away. &lt;(Grandmother) If the roads will retain the sound of my footsteps. &lt;(Tommaso) I have to greet my own city before leaving. &lt;To my grandchildren Antonio, Elena and Tommaso ... ... I leave everything I have ... ... But I leave to Antonio the lands that belonged to Nicola. &lt;You have to come back here, Antonio, because you belong here. &lt;You'll have the land, the force that lives when we die. &lt;You, Luciana, you'll have everything you need but you need to be braver. &lt;The thieves don't necessarily have to pass through window. &lt;That's your home too. &lt;You, Vincenzo and Stefania, there's nothing you can do ... ... to avoid loving Antonio. &lt;The soil can't really want to hurt the tree. &lt;Tommaso, write about us, about our history, about our land ... ... about what we did well and about what we did wrong ... ... about what we couldn't do because we were too small for this life ... ... Which is so large. &lt;The loose cannon is gone, that's how you called me ... ... Thinking that I couldn't hear you. &lt;But the loose cannons are meant to mess up everything ... ... To move things in places where nobody wanted ... ... To dismantle everything ... ... And to spoil plans. &lt;Nicola taught me the most important thing. &lt;To smile when you're sick, when you would die inside. &lt;Don't be sad for me when you don't hear my voice at home. &lt;The life is never in our rooms. &lt;We die and then we come back ... ... Like anything does. [RHYTHMIC MUSIC]
