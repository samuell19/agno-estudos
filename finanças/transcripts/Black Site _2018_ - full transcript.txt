In 1926, a United States led international organization to find and capture the Elder Gods was founded. This organization is known as Artemis. The Black Site is a top-secret facility used to deport the Elder Gods back to the other dimension. An advanced laser system called the Electrified Light Field keeps the Elder Gods from escaping. Magic protects the site from gunfire and explosions. Once they're sent back, they never return. Help Me. Are you okay? Just feel a bit uneasy. We'll get him. Ren? Stay in the bed. It's safe there. Helen? Ren. So, where are we going, somewhere sunny, maybe? My girlfriend, she left me last week. Yeah, so somewhere tropical would be, would be awesome. I'm a field officer. You're deportation. We don't talk. Hey, I know the rules, okay? It'd just be nice to know where I'm goin' for a change. That's all I'm sayin'. You'd have got on great with my ex. Test, test. 73 active agents on site. There are currently zero visitors. You're in early, Joe? Double shift. Understaffed again. They brought in three new guys to train up though, so, I'll be out of here in no time. You and me both, hopefully. How, uh... How did the exam go? Better. I think I did it this time. I still don't get it, Ren, why don't you just transfer to one of the other agencies like I'm doing? I mean, look around. There's nowhere near enough budget for this. My dad was a field officer, his dad was a field officer, and I'm gonna be a field officer. Even if you do end up in the field, there won't be any Elder Gods left soon, that's why they haven't spent anythin' on this place in years! Then I'll be the last agent standing. Joe to Maintenance. The Electrified Light Field at the left entrance is down. Again. Can someone with half a brain cell please down there and fix it? Uh, no. We're in the Deportation Zone today prepping the cell. So, it'll have to wait. It's your funeral. It's not real. It's in. I hope it's good news this time. Me, too. Oh, the newbies are upstairs, by the way. It's your turn to give 'em the talk. Seriously? Can you do it for me? Not a chance. Unless that letter says different, they're 100% your problem. Well, I guess I'm about to find out. Good luck. Call for Ren Reid, line three. Agent Reid, how can I help? What's wrong with you? Same old shit. I failed the test again. Oh, Ren, I'm sorry. As if you didn't know already. Yeah, but, still. You should've given me a heads-up, Jay. We can talk about this later. I've got news. Big news. How big? We got the motherfucker. Agent Washbourn, how can I help? Roger that, we'll be ready. Attention, we have a level 10 hostile inbound. All non-essential personnel must leave the site immediately. Drop whatever you're doing and go. You can lose the hood now. Well, great work as always, guys. I have absolutely no idea what we do, but uh, go team. You're needed at the Black Site. No, no, no, no. No, um, look, I told you, my girlfriend's left me. I need to go fly back to see her. Can't you get someone else to do it just this once? "Level 10 Deportation Officer needed." You're the closest. Sorry. You know, I do have a photographic memory. I'll be taking you through orientation for your new roles here at the Artemis International Black Site. The Black Site operated as a global headquarter for Artemis between 1941 and the early '70s. Ever since, the facility has been mostly closed down, and is used for deportations only, as and when is needed. So, this place is super dangerous, right? Occasionally. We run the site on a skeleton crew between deportations, because we have one hell of a security system. So, most of the time you'll be more than safe, even though you can't see it. Yeah, okay, but I haven't seen any guns. Guns don't work on the Black Site. Why not? In the 1980s, we captured the Elder God, Sudo, and brought him here for deportation. Sudo's worshipers seized the facility, and a lot of good agents were killed. After that, the site was warded to stop it from ever happening again with the markings that you can see all around this building. The incantations used prevent combustion from occurring on sites, making explosions and gunfire impossible. There's no hot water and all hot food is microwaved. You're gonna want thermal underwear for the winter. Hang on, so I can't smoke on site? Only if you get electrocuted. Alright, please watch the following video carefully. Welcome, I'm Professor August Kellerman, Chief Research Officer for Artemis. This facility is one of three, designated Site Beta. Its purpose is the research, questioning, and deportation of the Elder Gods, using incantations from ancient texts translated by myself. And the team of experts here at Artemis. As a member of the Artemis Black Site team, you may be asked to perform various duties. Each job is important, and ensures the continued safety of the entire human race. Soon after their release in 1926, we discovered that the Elder Gods had been weakened by their time in the other dimension, greatly reducing their power and size. One form of recovery for them is to hide inside a human vessel, and drain them of their life force, or essence. Using hitherto forgotten scripts, the research team here at Artemis have been able to train our field teams to bind the Elder Gods to a human vessel. Thus, making them safe for transportation to this site, where they will be deported. Do not make eye-contact directly with an Elder. To the untrained mind, the effects can be irreversible. Um, actually, this video's a little outdated. As I said, you can't smoke on the Black Site anymore. Reid. Mind if we talk? They've caught him, you know. Erebus. The one that killed your parents. I got the call. John Austin? He recommended I send you home on this one. Did he tell you that? You can't! I can. I'm the boss. But luckily for you, I think seeing this thing deported will actually do you some good. Face your fears. Type of thing my mom would've done to me. She was a mean old bitch, that one. You don't have a mom, so consider it a freebie. Thank you. That means a lot to me. The deportation officer will be arriving later today. You're gonna sign him in, prep him, and take him down to the bye-bye room. Then you can watch that piece of shit go back to where he came from. After this, though, no more trying to pass your exam. Commit to your job here. And we move on. Erebus is being brought in now in a wagon. I expect you not to interfere with the interrogation. Just get Sam Levi ready for the deportation. Go on, then. Out you go. Level 10 hostile inbound. All non-essential personnel must leave the site now. Check all your weapons in at the main door and collect a baton, let's get this asshole down to the interrogation room as quick as we can, no mistakes. Is he secure? Yes, sir. I'll be in soon. What're you still doin' here? Your request to have me sent home was denied. Fuck, Ren, you can't be here. Who knows what effect this asshole's gonna have on you once he's awake? Just go home. I have every right to watch this fucker get deported, Jay. And you know it. If your dad was here, he'd want me to send you somewhere safe. Well, he isn't, Jay. And it's not your fault that he isn't, either. Look, I'm grateful for everything that you and your mom did for me. But you're not my guardian. This thing took him away from me. And I wanna see his eyes when you send him back. Besides, I'm on duty. I'm checking the deportation officer in. Yeah, who we got? Um, Sam something? Sam Levi. Fuck, not that guy. Why, what's wrong with him? Nothing, he's just kind of borin'. Okay. You can stay. And I won't complain about it. But if you start to see things, I want you to promise me you will go home. Just don't go easy on him in there. I won't. This meat suit you've put me in. It's hardly five-star accommodation, is it? Pain. Such a fleetingly mortal experience. But playing rough won't get you anywhere with me. Oh, yeah? We'll see about that. Will you pointless specks of dust hurry up and get this conversation over and done with? I believe I have a deportation to attend. Plenty of time for that. After all, you've got an eternity to waste. So, let's get down to business. Erebus. The Devourer. The Filler of Space. He Who Comes in the Dark. Quite the impressive list of titles you have. You humans. Always trying to give names to things. As if it will give you some sort of ownership over it. The truth is, nothing in the Cosmos cares what you call it. Nothing in the Cosmos cares about you at all. Well, this is turning into the worst first date ever. Let's start again, shall we? What would you like me to call you? For you to speak my true name, I would have to cut your tongue out. Well, I think we'll pass on that. This fine fellow whose body you're currently wearing is convicted murderer, Jerome Davis. He sounds fun. Jerome it is, then. So, Jerome. This is how it works. I need the name and location of one other Elder God, and then we can make all this unpleasantness just go away, and send you back to hell quickly. How does that sound? The illusion of power. It must feel nice. Comforting, even. But I am one of the first five things in all of existence. Born from the chaos of this universe. Time and space present themselves to me in a way you couldn't possibly imagine. And even though mankind knows this, you're still arrogant enough to think you might have anything over something like me. What's funny, Jerome, is that the Elder God, Nixx, apparently said something very similar. You and her were close, right? Her Intel kept us busy for years. You are not fit to speak her name. She was Agent Austin's first ever deportation, I believe. Must've been a lonely 20 years for you without her. If it wasn't for these symbols, and cheap parlor tricks that you have bound me with, I would turn you and everybody in this facility inside-out. Just to pass the time. Well, I'll uh, bear that in mind. While we torture the shit out of you. Agent Ren Reid. You might wanna keep this one covered up whilst you wait. Why? He's a talker. I can handle that. There are currently two visitors on site. Ow. Hey. Can I? Okay. Right. I'm Sam. Sam Levi. I know. Sorry, um, so what's on the agenda today? Well, it's need-to-know only, and you... Don't tell me, I don't need to know. Hello. Hi, me again. Seriously, what is the plan for today? Because my girlfriend's at home, she's packing up all of her stuff as we speak, and I kinda need to get back to her ASAP? So, did you dump her, or she dumped you? Nobody dumped anybody. It's complicated. She dumped you. What did you do? I didn't do anything. If you must know, she um... She called me boring. Yeah, I heard that. So you wanna know the plan! Uh, okay, well basically we're gonna stay here, until they call for us over the intercom, at which point you'll put back on the hood and the earphones and when they ask you to, you will recite a piece of text that apparently you've memorized. Sounds good? Sounds boring, actually. Well, you would know. Alright, I'm gonna go and get us some drinks while we wait. This door locks automatically. So don't go trying to look around. Fine. It's not like I've got anywhere important to be. Good boy. This isn't working, I say we just send him down to the bye-bye room and deport him. With all due respect, we got a lot more we can hit with first. Trust me, Agent Austin, I'd love to sit here and watch you cut fingers and toes off all night, but there are some kidney stones you just can't piss out. You understand what I'm saying. Get him down to Deportation. I owe Rob Reid. I'm the reason Erebus got away that night. I'm the reason Ren's family are dead. Ah. Ren Reid. She's grown up to be such a... Disappointment. Shut your mouth. You know, I've felt her her entire life. We're connected. I can feel her now. In this building. Just as I always knew she would be. What are you talking about? I feel a little reunion coming on. How do I look? I need to go get Ren off site just in case. Agreed, let's go. Get this piece of shit down to a cell. We'll bring back the deportation officer. I hate to burst your little Alpha Human bubble... But you're already too late. Yeah? Why is that? Because. They're already here. Joe, can I get a check on the left entrance, please? I've already told maintenance, the whole area is down, I can't see anything from this end. Roger that, I'll take a look. Left entrance, come in. What did you find? I'm surrounded by idiots. Left entrance, come in. Hello? The telephones are no longer in service. There are 12 visitors on site. There are 31 visitors on site. There are 53 visitors on site. There are 53 visitors on site. There are 53 visitors on site. I've secured the monitoring room. Hey, do you mind if I read one of these? Those are need-to-know. So, why put them in a waiting room? So that if someone like you touches them, then I have a legitimate excuse to hurt you. Wow. I'm glad I'm not the only one not getting any. You know, I used to date a guy like you. Oh, yeah? Mm-hm. Boring. He was all clingy and needy. You know how I broke up with him? How, how? Over text. Charming. I'm just saying. Your girlfriend could've been much harsher. I would've been. Okay, the gas has started to clear, but there are still plenty of active cameras left. Keep your mask on, unless you wanna end up getting picked up by Artemis. Got it, keep your masks on. This way. Don't move! I said, don't fucking move! Attention all officers we have a situation in the blue zone. Find the deportation officer. Do not kill him. Copy that, follow me. Security protocol 18 is now in effect. Lockdown will commence in three minutes. All personnel, the facility is under attack. This is not a drill, get your shit together. Ker? Go. They're moved Erebus to the Deportation Zone already. I'm just tryin' to find you a route now. There are two more agents headed your way. The E.I.F will activate, hold on. Where is Erebus? Kill them both. Okay, take the door behind you, keep turning left. Erebus is there. Give me Erebus and we'll go. You better be sure you can win this. Otherwise, you're gonna wish you found Jesus instead. Security protocol 18 is now in effect. 20 seconds until lockdown. 10 seconds until lockdown. Five seconds until lockdown. Three, two, one. Security protocol 18 is now in effect. Electrified Light Field is now activated. Hey. Hey. Hey. Help me. What's wrong with you? Snap out of it, come on. What the fuck? What is going on? I don't know! You started freaking out and some woman came on the intercom and said we were under attack! Shh! Hold on, I heard somethin'. All clear. Same here. Fuck. I've got to get you down to the deportation room. Are you joking? You listen to me, dickhead. I don't know you and I don't care what your hangups are. The closest person I have to family is trapped down there. So you're gonna get over your fucking self, and you're gonna come with me. Am I making myself clear? We found Ker. Decode that door. How long? What're we supposed to do now? Radio the others and find them. We're gonna get Erebus out of that body, we need him alive. We'll find him. You two, come with me. Access denied. Electrified Light Field still activated. Over here. I see you've met Ker. How do you like your new cell? More cheap parlor tricks. Boring. Are you okay? Yeah. Ren. Ren, it's John, I'm locked down in the Deportation Zone with Wilkinson and our guest. Jay, are you okay? I'm hurt pretty bad. How bad? That's not important. Yes, it is. Tell me. You need to get Sam Levi outta here. Erebus is no good to them without him. Fuck that. Ren. Hang in there, I'm coming. Hey, hey. You see a bad guy, you stab him, got it? Ah, no. Alright, well, what do we do now? Your file said you have a photographic memory. Yeah, so? So if we're gonna get you down to that room and prove you're not the boring fuck-face everybody says you are, we're gonna need something first. "Boring fuck-face?" What are these symbols for? They're called wards. They protect the facility against certain types of attack. They activated when the security system switched on. Ah. And what about that? Is that part of the security system, too? Mm-hm. That is an E.I.F, short for Electrified Light Field. Yeah, go through that, and you'll know what a Pop Tart feels like at breakfast. Well, how're we supposed to get through that? I'll show you. Shh, shh. This way, there must be a way through. Access denied. Electrified Light Field still activated. Don't do anything. You've got this. You're a bad ass. You can do it. You are not filling me with a lot of confidence here. Oh, what's takin' so long? Come on, man, you fuckin' idiot. Access denied. Electrified Light Field still activated. Sorry to interrupt, guys. You don't know where the bathroom is, do you? You're not goin' anywhere. Yeah, let's cut her up. Electrified Light Field still activated. Proximity warning. Electrified Light Field still activated. Next time... You said, "Don't do anything." Yeah, well, I meant do something. You know, you've got real communication issues. I'm not gonna lie to you, Jay. You might need a few stitches. Oh. That doesn't look good. Go fuck yourself. You can make all the jokes you want, old timer. It won't matter. You're still going back by the end of tonight. I'll never get used to that stench of human arrogance. You know, you're like the sweaty armpit of the Cosmos. You Elder Gods all talk a big game. Always like to remind us how insignificant you think we are. Yet here you are. Hiding on our planet. And living inside human hosts. You know, there was a time when I was so powerful... So beyond what your little minds could comprehend, I didn't even notice your kind. But you crave attention, like little children. Then you stripped us of our glory, and then our home. You had no right. Or reason. You know, I have had eons, to reflect on your kind. The things we could've done. The mistakes we might have made. But ultimately, I realized, just how utterly pointless you are. Does that not bother you? Do you not fear your own insignificance? We have each other. There's more significance in that than a thing like you could ever understand. See, eventually, it'll come down to you or us. And we chose us. I had companionship on a scale you would never understand. And then you took her from me. And deported her. What gives your species the right to do the things that you do to mine? It gives us purpose. Touche. Well, let's hope our little mutual friend, Ren, finds her purpose this evening. Sit. This facility is split into three zones. Blue, Green and Red. We're currently in Red Zone. Each zone is separated by the E.I.F security system. Now, this folder contains all the deactivation codes for each zone, so use your oversized brain, and remember the codes. Okay. Before we're both violently killed. The E.I.F box is right here. Security protocol 18 is now in effect. What is going on with you? Nothing. Really? I saw an Elder God when I was a kid, it fucked me up. I'm dealin' with it. Wait, is that why they cover my eyes and ears? So I don't go crazy? I'm not crazy. Ever since they brought Erebus into the facility, the things I've been seeing are getting more intense. Well, what can we do? Switch off this doorway. So we can go and deport the son of a bitch. Okay. Access granted. Okay, heads up, everyone. The deportation officer is headed your way, and he's got company. She's got some moves, so watch yourself. First number accepted. Phones are still down. Second number accepted. Uh-oh. I'm guessing the beeps are bad news for you guys. Oh, shut up. You know, for the fifth-oldest thing in existence, I'd have thought you'd gotten bored with the sound of your voice by now. You see? There can be peace between us after all. The foot doesn't make friends with the dog shit it steps in. I got a question. If you're so above us, why bother going after Rob Reid 20 years ago? Because he took her from me. Nixx. Do not speak her name again. Someone's touchy. You're right. I apologize. Such a petty human emotion. You see, the more time I spend inside this human vessel, the more infected I become with your little quirks. Seems like quite the posse of humans you've been hangin' out with, huh? The cult? Oh, that was Nixx's idea. You see, when we first came back to this place, we were a shadow of our former selves. Taking your life force was the quickest way for us to get that Friday feeling again. Unfortunately, jumping from body to body leaves a trail for your agents to follow. So we decided to start our own farm. How'd that turn out? As disappointing as everything else in this world. Okay, they're heading towards the disused kitchen area. You can cut them off there. Copy that. You're gonna have to fight. What? No, no, no, I can't. Well, we're surrounded, so you're gonna have to man up. You take three and I'll take three. How's about you take five and I take the little one? Just go ahead. Okay. Sorry, guys. Kitchen's closed. You'll have to find somewhere else. I'll get him, kill the girl. I'm out of arrows. Get out of there and regroup with the others. Are you okay? Did I win? Sixth number accepted. It's bad, right? Look on the bright side. At least your face is still pretty. Tick-tock, tick-tock. Time is almost up for you. Time's almost up for both of us. That's not really true, though, is it? See, I might be going on an extended holiday, but you? You're going nowhere. Back to the nothingness you came from. Alright, pal, whatever you say. Ah! There it is. There what is? That moment of blind hope in his eyes. After everything he knows about the Universe. About my kind. About where your kind comes from. In spite of that, he still thinks that maybe, just maybe, there's something after this life. A light at the end of the tunnel. It's pathetic. Well, maybe we just keep you here, instead of sending you back to your girlfriend. Let's see who's laughing then. Do you think that might happen? Because I don't. I've seen this moment. Seen this room. Seen me and her reunited. How? I told you. Time works differently for me. I think you should be more concerned with saying your goodbyes, before you have to take your short train ride to oblivion. Fuck him! This area is clear. For fuck sake. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Ren, can you hear me? I'm still here. I was afraid you got yourself killed. How're you holdin' up? Ren? Just peachy. You? I've been better. You still got our guest? He's still in one piece. At least, for now. The place is overrun with some kind of Elder cult. We know, they're currently decoding the E.I.F in the Deportation Zone. It won't be long before they're in. Don't worry. I'll be in the Blue Zone soon. Gotta go. Listen, Ren, I... Stay safe, okay? That looks bad. Yeah, it feels bad. Move your hand. Yeah, you got a cracked rib. Ren? That sucks for you. Are you okay? You know my girlfriend left me last week 'cause she said I was "too safe?" Now look at me! I'm runnin' round an underground facility, fightin' wannabe ninjas. With a cracked rib. So I can deport a god. So, no, I'm not okay. Well, you know, for a guy with zero skills, and no interest in what he's been actually been doing for a job... You're alright. Thanks. Hey, um... You know, when this whole thing blows over, and if you're not busy and, you know, doing anything, um... Would you like to go for a drink with me? Never gonna happen. Oh, I said you were alright, I didn't say you were dateable. Oh, come on, the hero is supposed to get the girl. Dude, you're the sidekick. Help me. Are you okay? I think it's trying to tell me something. "It?" It, you know? Him. Well, what's he tryin' to tell you? I think he wants me to deport him. Okay, Ker, the deportation officer and the girl are headed towards the Blue Zone, by the gym. Everyone else who's nearby, get there now and back her up. Access granted. Electrified Light Field deactivated. I saw you. He showed you to me. So, you're the girl. Talks about you all the time, you know. Really pisses me off. You must be the deportation officer. You're coming with me. Behave, and I'll let you keep your feet. Sam, go to the deportation room. Where? Two corridors down, turn left, go. But what... Just go! Rude. I called the dibs. Here they are, she's got company, get her! 13th number accepted. One number remaining. Now, listen. Time's almost up. Fuck you. No. He's right. I'm done. Do you want me to give her a message? No, I'll do it myself. You can give her this, though. Sure. There you go. Ren. I need you to know something before I go. I need you to know how proud your dad would've been of what you've become. Whatever you do... Don't give up. Don't let what happened stop you. Stop the code now! You can fight it. Earlier on, you... You told me I wasn't your guardian. Help me. And you were right, I'm not. I'm your family. Access granted. Electrified Light Field deactivated. I'm so sorry, Ren. My salvation. Finally here. Ker, come in. Is she dead? She's down. No, fuck this, I'm out. I'm not getting caught by Artemis, I have a family. What about Ker? What about her? She's got nothin' to lose, get out of there. It's over. Okay, abort. Everyone find an exit or get left behind. So, he can't cross these? No. Doesn't stop his yapping, though, sadly. Well, well. Look at you. All these years of communicating with you across time and space. And now... Here you are. All grown up. My visions, it was you. I told you. We're connected. Why? I see time in fragments. Bits and pieces. All those years ago, when I came to your home, I looked at you, and I saw this day. Felt this pain. That I feel now. And I knew. Knew what? That one day, you would save me. Listen. For everyone that isn't a batshit-crazy god, do you just wanna tell us what the fuck you're talking about? When your agents caught and deported my love, I was determined to bring her back. So, I returned to our followers, and I began to drain them at speed to build up my strength. But they turned on me. Because of her. Sword girl? Her name is Ker. They trapped me in a ward. Much like the one I'm currently standing in. Making me change vessels weekly. They believe draining the blood of my vessel and drinking it gives them power. Which is total bullshit, by the way. It is excruciating pain for me, though. I reached out to you many times, Ren. But human brains are far too weak to grasp my true voice. Yours is stronger than most, though. If that makes you feel better. Hey, so that means you're not crazy. How did you end up here? I realized that what I'd seen when I looked at you all those years ago... My deportation. My reunion with Nixx. So, I escaped. And then purposely got myself caught by your agents. You want to be deported. I had spent eons over there, weakened. Longing to come back. But now, it would appear this universe is not just a cruel joke on your kind, but mine, too. I see it now, though. It is this world that is hell. You know, I always thought it was me that was afraid. That I was too scared from seeing the real you to live my life properly. You say you've been feeling pain. But I know you're lying. It's not pain, is it? It's fear. You're scared you're just as meaningless as the rest of us. Send me back now, and let's finish this. I could just give you to Ker and let you suffer. Bad god. Who let you off your leash? Prison cell breached. Deport me now or I will snap her neck. Do it, Sam. Shut him up. Looks like you're gonna have to find yourself a new god. I like you. Shame I have to kill you. Might as well die with some honor. How the fuck? The illusion of power. Where's your god now? Stop! Prison cell breached. You can't kill me. Just send me back. No. You said something to me that night. "I see you. "You will see me. "Don't you ever forget my face, motherfucker." Deportation complete. Not so boring now, eh? Not bad for a sidekick. Not bad at all. I'll see to Jay's funeral arrangements. He, uh... He wanted you to have this. I... No. You've earned it. Welcome to active duty. Fucking Black Site.
