Put the fertilizer in the onion and feed the horses. Don't forget. Let's go for a ride. -Now? It won't take long. Come on, get in. But the washing... -Don't worry about it. I'm giving you permission. "La la la la and I am so sad "So I go to Bertha's and I sit with her "She gives me coffee -"You're so cute..." No, no. "I show her my palm "She tells me -"You're so cute "You're all right, now give me a tenner..." Come and look. Who is she? Shmuel, there's somebody here. -There's nobody here. Get up! Hey, kid! Here you are. I made them this morning. Great cookies. Come sit with us. -I've tons of work to do. Tons of work... Yeah, right. Hi. How's everything? -Normal. Everything OK? -Yeah. Where are the kids? At the computer. -Did they have anything to eat? Lunch's still on the table. They didn't touch it. Hi. How's everything? -Okay. Want some, Suhilla? I drank already. How're things around here? -Everything's fine. I washed the windows and hosed down the nets. The washing? -I hung it in the back 'cause of the wind. And I made lunch for the kids. See? But they didn't touch it. Come, Abed, take me home. It's getting late. -All of a sudden you a princess? You can walk home. You talk too much. Come on, let's go. See you. -Don't talk to me about wholesalers. You know I grow good stuff. 60 boxes at 50 shekels. Yes. Get the truck down here. -I'm taking her home. Keep safe. I'll have it ready for you 6 o'clock in the morning. Get out. There's your husband. Get out. Get inside! Good evening, Abu-Ahmad. -Good evening A smoke? Quiet, Rex! Rex, go away! Suhilla! What happened? Who beat you up like that? -My husband. Come on. Get up. Slowly. Keep quiet. You shouldn't have come here. It was a mistake. Did they say anything about me? -No. Did they or didn't they? -They didn't. Or about anybody else? -The kids were talking. Abed! Oh my God! Who beat you up? Did anybody see you come here? No. -How did you get away from him? -I ran away. I hid. What did you tell him? I didn't tell him anything. Did you talk to him? -No. He just stood there and didn't say a word. Why did you come here? It would just complicate things. Where could I go? They're gonna kill me. They'll butcher me. You don't understand. -Keep your voice down. I have a wife and 3 kids. Your whole tribe'll be coming in. Where would I go? I won't carry this whole thing all by myself. What did she say? That she won't be carrying this whole thing alone. Where are all your high words? Did you forget, Shmuel? You promised you'd take care of me. You won't leave me, will you? You won't desert me, right? Don't leave me... Don't... Suhilla, you can't stay here. You've got to leave. What's done is done. Now we each go our own way. -I'm not leaving. I'm not. -Get up! Get up! Where would I go? -Anywhere but here! What about my job? -What job? -I work here, don't I? Don't you understand? It's finished. You don't work here any more. What will you tell your wife? -About what? About me. -Leave that to me. It's not your concern. Shmuel? -Shut up! I'm telling you for the last time, your people'll come and they'll slay you like a dog. You, too. She must leave immediately. We've got to get her out of here. She wants you to take care of her. They'll kill her like a dog. You know how much she loves you. -It'll destroy my family! You heard her. "Your wife... They'll kill me..." That would only be the beginning. -I told you you should stop. Our people never forgive. It bothered even me, seeing you like that. Abed, listen to me carefully. You're in this deep, too, whether you like it or not. Take her away. I don't wanna see her any more. Where would I take her? -They don't know anything. They have no proof. But if she opens her mouth, we've both had it. OK. Just let her stay here till morning. Then... Forget morning! Now! Before she tells them everything. Get her away from here and out of sight! What am I gonna do? God, what am I gonna do? Dear God... Abed! Are you with me or aren't you? I'll make it up to you. OK? Just name it. Get up! Where to? Abed's taking you to Hirbet Ujah. -No! Tomorrow morning I'll come by and we'll talk. -But ... No buts! -Shmuel... Tomorrow morning, when Anat leaves, I'll come over and we'll straighten things up. Abed, on your way. Come. What time is it? It's noon. He said he'd come in the morning. Abed, tell me the truth. In the name of God, tell me the truth. What did he tell you to do? Have some tea. He said he loved me. That he'll never desert me. That I'd never want for anything. I told you a thousand times: "Enough with the disgrace! You didn't care that I had to sit there and watch the whole thing. I've been with him for two years. I've loved him more than anything. You should've been hanged, both of you! What was that bullshit anyway? What were you thinking? That he'd take you in with his wife and kids? Where was your head? He's not coming, is he? He has his reasons. Go on, Suhilla. Go. Get out and go. And never come back. Shmuel's got his own problems. He won't change his mind. And our people'd kill you on sight. Go mingle with the Jews. Go live among them. Look for a job and for a place to stay. Let a couple of years go by. Time heals everything. Here's some money. Take it. Go on, Suhilla. Go. Goon. Abed... Good morning. -Morning. This is Mussa, Suhilla's brother. How are you? Is anything wrong? We're looking for Suhilla. She's been gone for two days. We thought she was sick. She didn't come yesterday either? -No. We thought she wasn't feeling well. Where is she? God knows. Ra'hat. -What is "Ra'hat"? Gone. Hold on. When did you last see her? Night before last. Did you look for her? Has anybody seen her? But she works here. Did you look elsewhere? -At the gas station. The junction. She's gone. If she comes, tell her to come back home. She's got nothing to fear. Let's go. See you. Something must have happened to her. People don't just disappear. What d'you think? -It's an inside thing. A tribe affair. Shmuel, I need Abed to do a few things in the house. When we're finished out here I'll send him in. We don't know anything, right? Where's the rifle? -In the shed. Is it clean? -lt is. Make it disappear. Okay. Abed? Open up. Abed... What's this? -I couldn't do it, Shmuel. I know you told him to kill me! Shut up! -You don't care if I die! You don't care about my kids! I'm warning you... -You said you'd divorce her. Be still! You said I'd come live here! -Silence! They should all know. Murderer! -I'll count to 3! One... -I won't shut up! Two... I'm gonna kill you. I swear. Let them all hear it. -I'm gonna count to three... One... -Shmuel, no! Get the truck, and bury the rifle so no one'll find it. Give me a hand here. Come on! Bye, Offri. -Bye, Mom. Gilat! Where's Adam? Adam, you'll be late! 'Let's go!! -'Bye, Dad! Careful when you cross the road. Have a nice day. Abu-Ahmad... Abu-Ahmad... Abu-Ahmad... -We found her... We found Suhilla... Dear God... Dear God... This is no regular bullet. Look, it's a 0.22, as thin as a needle. They brought her through here. -Where? -Right here. How did she get here? -She was dumped. By whom? -Soldiers, maybe. Listen. Not a word about it to anybody. Who did that to your sister? I'll get whoever did it. I swear to God. How did you find her in the growth? The sheep stopped and they wouldn't budge. We must go to the police. Forget it. No police. We'll deal with it ourselves. Shmuel! "There is no God but Allah. "May God give me shelter from cursed Satan. "In the name of Allah the merciful. "Bless Him who had given The Book to his servant "and made him stick to the right path "and had warned a new nation..." May God comfort you. Does the police know about this? What's the police got to do with it? -A woman was murdered. They should be informed. I would have gone to the police. -What can they do? She was messing with another man. It's a "family's honour” thing. This is how they deal with such matters. Go search the stable and the sheds. One word and I'll cut your throat. Get up! Where did you get the scooter? -I bought it. -With what money? Are you questioning me? -Answer him! I work. I saved. Why, how much does your Jew of a boss pay you? Hi. -Hello. -Where are your parents? I don't know. -They're coming. -Go get them. Go on. Look at your son. Look at him. Abed, did you do this? Did what? -You've shamed us. Now, 3 of our family will have to die. It's a feud, Abed. Speak up. Did you do it or didn't you? I didn't, father. I didn't do it. -Will you swear on the Koran that you didn't do it? I'll swear. My son is telling the truth. My son is telling the truth. Bring a Koran and let him swear on it. He's a murderer. He shouldn't even touch the holy Koran! Unholy blood! We'll kill you! Sit down, both of you! Fighting inside the Sheikh's tent? Sit down. Now tell me what happened. -Where's your rifle? What rifle? -The 0.22. You have a 0.22. rifle, right? I did. I sold it. -To whom? To a friend of Shmuel's. Long ago. -When? A few months back. Yours? Sold it, eh? You murderer! -Calm down, Khaled. Abed, come here. Did you kill Suhilla, yes or no? Tell me. -I didn't. I didn't do anything. -Then who killed her? I don't know. -What was going on between you two? Tell me the truth. Speak up. Nothing was going on between us. -His rifle. It's all clear now. He deserves to die. -Is this your rifle? Yes. -What?! So what? It means nothing. There are many rifles like that. I didn't kill her. I didn't do anything. Why are you accusing me? Why did you lie about the rifle? Why did you say you sold it? Why is your son keeping silent now? We have no choice but to put him through the "Fire test". Before anything worse happens. -We agree. The fire test is no child's play. It takes a man to stand it. Are you up to it? I am. -There's no way back from that fire test. I know. Good morning, Shmuel. -Hi, Yoram. How are things? Your girl threw you out of bed? Got any coffee for me? -Sure. Hi, Yoram. -Morning, Anat. -Morning. I've been told your maid had been murdered. That's right. -Why didn't you report it? Aren't we supposed to be informed? When did it happened? She disappeared a few days ago. Didn't show up for work. They found her somewhere, slain. A woman gets killed like a dog and nobody does anything. We can't do much. That how they deal with it. With murder? We have prisons, you know. What is it with you? It's nothing new. What is it? Why are you looking at me like that? Go make some coffee, OK? How d'you like yours? -Black. Two sugar. Where's your Bedouin worker? He's with the tribe. Mourning. They're family. Shmuel, why you didn't report? -Why should I? She didn't die here. If you hear anything, call us. -Sure thing. Listen, son... you lick the spoon 3 times without moving your head, not to the left nor to the right. Do not scratch your tongue against your teeth. Then rinse your mouth with water 3 times. The third time you leave it in your mouth for a while then spit it out. If the spoon leaves a mark on your tongue in the shape of a burn or a swelling, you're a liar. But if your tongue stays clean, you're telling the truth. May God help us do justice. Let's pray. Stick it out. All the way. Go show it to the witnesses. I'm a witness that the man is telling the truth. He is innocent. -But how can that be? That's his rifle. -Who killed her? Who is the murderer? Silence, both of you. -That's his rifle! Listen to me. Abed, I know that you are innocent. You did not kill Suhilla. But I also know that you know who did. Talk. Speak up. Who killed her? Are you a Bedouin? Were you a Bedouin, you'd talk. She was doing it with my boss. It went on for two years. She loved him very much. She wanted him to hide her at his home. And where were you for two whole years? Did you shut your eyes? You didn't see? What could I do? I was working for him. Couldn't interfere. Honor is more important than money or work. But the Jews have blinded you with their money. You were half here, half there. You wanted to have both ends. To live in both worlds. But that cannot be done. By God, you've already forgotten the simplest prayers. Now listen to me, Abed son of Abu-Na'if. From now on you are not one of us! We do not know you anymore! Don't ever come back here unless you did what you have to do. What any Bedouin who has honour would do. All these man are my witnesses. Shmuel... Where's Abed? He's not working here any more. -What do you mean? I fired him. He was conning me. Are you involved with what happened to Suhilla? Listen to me. We're leaving this place. We're leaving everything behind. The Bedouins will never leave you be. No one can't live in such fear. Not with children, anyway. What did you bring me, Mom? Humus with tomato and onion. Come, sit down. Sit down, Mom. Shmuel! Got any work for me? No. No work. Come back tomorrow. But why? I'm a good worker. I can do anything. Forget it. I said no work. Tomorrow. Shoot him! Shoot! Shoot him! Shoot! I told you to shoot him! Shoot him, you maniac! Upon my honour, I'll kill you! Go on, Suhilla. Go. Go mingle with the Jews. Go live among them. Look for a job and for a place to stay. Let a couple of years go by. Time heals everything. "Yellow Asphalt" Three desert stories English: Nurith Yehudai Subtitles: Elrom Studios
