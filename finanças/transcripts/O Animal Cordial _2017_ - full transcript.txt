Six hundred and fifty, seven hundred. I wonder how he eats. I don't know about eating, but drinking... - Three hundred... - Do you think he's fast? How would you prefer? Tell me. I don't know... I want him to be quick. Wish hard it and it'll happen. Five hundred and seventeen plus ninety... six hundred and seven... Poor man. Poor me, still here. It's so sad to eat out alone. Gosh... Such a big man... Bring me the rabbit, Jura. I would never guess he'd order this dish. It doesn't suit him. Not at all. He's too big of a man for a small piece of meat... THE FRIENDLY BEAST Excuse me. The kitchen closes in thirty minutes. Are you trying to fool me? Sorry? I told you I have problems with garlic. Yes, you did. - Just a little can ruin the meal. - Don't worry, I told the chef. Don't worry. Anything else? I guess not. Enjoy your meal. Tired? Yes. Very. Wanna do something after work? Like what? Like... Whatever you want. What I really need is a massage. Lucio. That's not what I meant. What? You shouldn't be on the phone. It's unprofessional. They will catch you. - Do you have the keys? - No, they're with Mr. Inácio. Ew! That really stinks. I'll use the front door, ok? Ana, there's still a customer in the dining room. Go, take it back to the kitchen. More customers. - I can stay. - Go home. You need to rest. - It's okay. I can stay, Mr. Inácio. How many? - Two. Should I stay too? No, you can go. I can manage with her. You can go. I don't think they'll be here long. We've turned the oven off... Cleaned almost everything. And our shift is over. Actually... Actually, you have fifteen minutes left. On Wednesday, a journalist will be here to write a piece. What's that smell? - Garbage. The back door is still locked. Do you have the keys? No. I want a special menu. A critic is coming to rate the restaurant with stars. "Special" how? Aren't you the cook? Seafood? No, not seafood. Red meat. Think of something new. And let me know in advance. It's rare a magazine like that knocking on our door. Which magazine? What's the name of the magazine? You got me. Excuse me... I need to get this... We're gonna do it, just this last time. Leave him with me. I'll draw the line today. Ana, sharpen my knife. Wasn't there a parking garage? Son-of-a-bitch, fucking city! Darling, don't be angry with me. - No, darling... No. It's not my fault. I had to go there. I'm not angry at you. I was... Listen to your voice. I know you very well, Inácio What's happening? Do me a favor. Don't use that car anymore. If you need to get out, get a taxi. Ok? No, why get a taxi if a have a car? I need to go back now. Don't wait for me. We'll finish late tonight. - Ok. Bye. - Bye. I'm an artist. Yes, the recipes are mine, indeed. That's a tough one. Inspiration comes... from so many places... my trips... family memories. My most famous recipe came from a dream. I woke up and wrote it down. As if I were... Possessed. Food is art. My staff is very united. My staff is very united, yes. If I'd do something else? Someone broke the soap dispenser. - We need to get it fixed. - Okay. Have they ordered yet? They're still deciding on the wine. - It's too dirty? - No, it's perfect. How may I help you? He always reads the wine menu to the end. You should thank me. We always drink great wine. Care for a recommendation? Are you the owner? Which fine wine do you suggest? Is this Bordeaux Le Dome... from the Pomerol region? No. It's from Saint-Emillion. Sure? Yes. What wine really did the girl suggested, Bruno? What she said? It was Chardonnay Rosso. Chardonnay Rouge. Stop. Do you care for any suggestion? The girl suggested wild boar. Wild boar is a good choice. Wild boar meat calls for a full-bodied wine. Like a Saint-Amour. No, no. It'll be this one, Chateau LaCroix. Half a bottle? A regular one. Can you bring a bottle and two glasses? Saint-Amour sounds so romantic. I would love that. You're going to love this one. - I've never had the one you ordered. - It's very good. Just one thing... If it is Bordeaux, it has to be from Pomerol. Anyone who knows about wine knows that. - Why you never let me choose the wine? - You're going to like it. Have you seen its price? Big deal. This wine it's magnific. Here it is: Chateau LaCroix, 2006 A very special wine. A very special wine... for a very special lady. Can I take it? What time does the kitchen close? In fifteen minutes. - We have time. - We almost missed it. We're hungry. We came from a party. It was so boring. - Bye. - Bye. Very good. Oak. Warm. Persistent. Great wine. Wow... It really is good. You can pour, please. Take it easy, Veronica. Are you also a sommelier? No. I am a wine lover. What are we ordering, then? The poor girl is waiting. The one she suggested? It could be. We'll have the one you told us. - Rare, medium? - We were at a winery in France last year. Excuse-me... - How would you like your meat? Medium. What's the name of the winery, Bruno? That we visited last year in the South of France. Chateau Petit Village. Please. Whiskey, no ice. In a minute. Can I take your plate? Excuse-me. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. No problem. Whiskey. Was everything to your taste? Yes, everything was very good. I'd never eaten rabbit before. It's a family recipe. My grandfather... My grandfather used to hunt. He said it only needs one shot because rabbits are small. Not much meat. Please, let me offer you a digestif, on the house. Bitch. Pull your hair up... it'll fall on the food. What are you looking at? Assface! The dishes for table two are almost ready. I came to talk to you about Wednesday. A friend of my wife's is coming on Wednesday... The journalist? Do you already know? They were talking about it in the kitchen. And what were they saying? Nothing specific. Those guys at the kitchen... aren't easy. Well, just to let you know. Some people like to dress up to have their picture taken. Do you think I need to improve on anything? I mean... in the restaurant. For Wednesday's interview. Your opinion is really important to me. For example... the table cloths? Don't you like the table cloths? I like them, but like this... They don't cause an impression. But then... what instead? Place mats. It may be good. But then I'd also need... to change the tables... Nevermind. Nonsense. The table cloths stay. It smells great. It's raw. I ordered it medium. Taste it. We don't have small change. How much do you need? Eleven and forty cents. We really need to go. Alright. But no need to come back. Not tomorrow, nor ever again. Sara, could you please take... What's going on here? Garbage? With customers? They couldn't wait. The subway closes. They really needed to go. About that, man... The kids can't stay here so late. No way. We need to talk about this, and other things too. We will talk, "man". Wait for me in the kitchen. - Not today, I have to... - Djair, I'm asking you to wait in the kitchen. - I've heard you. But I'll wait here. The money! Hand it over! - Hand over the money! - You shit! Go fuck yourself. Hand it over! Give me the money. On the table. Everything on the table! From the safe and from the register. What are you looking at? Get up! Get up! Calm down. Calm my ass. Shut up. Get up! Any funny move and I'll put a bullet in her head! Head down! - Chill, honey. Chill. - For God sake. Bruno. Head down! Keep calm, honey. Stop... Stop... She's all wet. - Stop it! - You stop! You started it! Fuck you. Get off, bitch, get off. Hand over the fucking money! Can't you see this is no game? Hurry up. Let's go! Are you crazy? We planned everthing, dumb-ass. You think only you can do it?! - Cover your face! - Take your hands off me. She's ugly but she'll do. - That that off my face! - No, I won't, you dumb-ass! You are dumb! There are cameras here. - Take this shit off my face. - No! Put that shit away! - Don't be fucking stupid! - You'll shoot me? Drop the gun. Don't drop it. Don't drop it. Drop the gun! Fuck! Are you out of your mind? Why? He had a gun, Inácio. It's a toy. A toy? How did you know?! I'm not crazy. Not crazy, you were reckless. He could have shot us all. Better call the cops. And an ambulance. He won't last long. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. The lady needs a doctor, Inácio. Sara. Go to the stock room. Get the box tape. Rope, whatever you find. Bring it here. What is he doing? I'll take care of this son of a bitch. Wait. "Take care" how? You thought you could break into my restaurant, do whatever you want and get away with it? Turn around. - Turn around. - No, no. Turn around! Your arms. Sara. Sara, tie him. Djair. Lock him in the kitchen. I will take him. Calm down, Inácio. Can't you see the gun pointed to your face? Let's go! Veronica, come here. Veronica enough. Stop it, Veronica! Veronica! Come here. Calm down. Calm down Veronica. Sit down here. Calm down. We're going home. We're going home. What took you so long? What did you want? The guy there is quite strong. We must call the police. Not the police. What do you mean? They won't do anything. Do you remember the first time? It didn't do any good. All they did was scare customers away. The prick puts his hand in my cunt and you don't wanna call the police?! I want them all in jail to rot. They're nothing but filth. Look at this. Filth. Nobody is calling the police. It's money, right? - So I want cash. - Stop it, Veronica! They pointed a gun here. To my head. A gun. His hand was dirty. The smell. The smell is on me. It's on me now. I didn't want to eat that meat. I said I didn't want it. It was raw. Will anyone do something about this? Do you want some water? Shut up. I'm not talking to you. You nobody. I want a hundred thousand. - She's out of her mind. - Stop speaking for me! You disgust me! Inácio. I can drop them close to a medical center. And they can sort things out from there. She's not ok. The lady needs a doctor. Now, if he dies here, this place will be cursed forever. No one will ever set foot in here again. I know what I'm talking about. Let me see it. Let me. You think you can fool me, Djair? You set this up. You set this up to ruin my business. I don't need this. I work. I work here like a mule everyday. The freezer is leaking, the stove doesn't work, there's not even room for the trash... No, Inácio. You don't need anyone to ruin your restaurant. You know what? Go to hell. You and her, cause I'm not like her. Like me? - Kiss-ass, bootlicker, fucking brownnose! - Fuck you. - Fuck you! - Enough! Enough! Sara, tie him. What? Come. Touch me... Come on. - And I'll tear your face. - Djair! Don't test me. Go Sara. You're both sick. This is kidnapping and it means jailtime. It's my right. Djair. It is a toy. Stand up. I hope they rape you in jail. Sara! Enough! Watch the big one. You. Come here. - Tie your wife. - Are you kidding? Tie your wife. Now. Call the police. He's out of his mind. - He's a cop. - What? He's a cop. He wanted me to call the police. Please, turn around. You don't have to do this. Don't tie it too tight, I have poor circulation. Now what? Now we need a plan. I have to pee. I am going to wet my pants. Stop moving. You wanna turn me on, is that it! Fuck you, fag. Sorry for the inconvenience. I am a Federal Attorney. Look at me. Look at me, you asshole. Let me go. I won't take long. What do you cook here? Carrion? Djair! That one was for you. Prick... It was him you should have fucked. Do you hear, boy? You think we should be really worried about that guy? No. You don't have to worry. His problem's with me. Do you think so? Are you really a cop? Well, I went down the wrong path. Did you hear it, son of a bitch. There's a police officer here who saw everything you did to my wife. You're fucked, you piece of shit. Can you look away? Because this way I can't. I'm sorry. Finished? Do you have a boyfriend? None of your business. If you don't, it's because you don't want to. Listen, I can help you. Oh, really? How? I know people. Influent people. Much better than him. Enough, get up. Think about everything you have to live. Your family, friends. He's using you. Think about it, girl. You don't know shit about my life. And don't call me "girl". I have a name. My name is Sara. Sara. Say it! Sara. Enough, get up. And don't you think I'll wipe you, you filth. Wait. I haven't finished yet. But I really can't do this second part with you watching me. I really can't. You've got five minutes. Thanks... for defending me. In the robbery... When he came to... You know... Help me... Where did you learn to shoot? I took a course, after the first robbery. Gosh. That's brave. I'm scared to death of guns. Everything will be alright. - Did they hear the shot? No! I'd better close the curtains. - Sara. - What? You deserve a raise. For everything. We'll talk about it at the end of the month. No need. I insist. I'll check on the madam in the bathroom. You're not man enough to kill me. Look at you. So much pose for so little shit. Shoot. What was that? - He killed the boy... C'mon, boy, help me out. Come on! - You said we shouldn't worry. - Oh well, it seems I was wrong. - Two shots. I heard! Help! - Shut up! - Somebody! - Shut up! Shut up! We're at the end of the world. No one will hear you. If that son of a bitch shot my cousin again, I... What are you going to do? I'll kill him. "I'll kill him". How, boy? With your toy gun? Not “boy”. I have a name. Magno. We have to get out of here fast. Wait... Wait. Aren't you a cop? Where are your tricks? I'm retired. Fucking hell. It's no use. It's my fault if he dies. Does anyone know you're here, Magno? No. No one? What about you? Veronica. And you? Give me the keys. Does it hurt? No. You need a bandage. Tell him I'll... Tell him I... Do you know what I found in the first-aid kit? Nail pliers. And a cotton box. But it was empty. We could run away. To Santos. A friend of mine lives there. I trust her. Do you really think he'll cooperate? I think so. But you have to be firm. I never liked him. I thought you were all friends. Who? Tell... Tell him... I never got along with the kitchen staff. They're all worthless. The way he looked at me, the nerve on his left eye, it trembled. I know. I know it was him. Wood or porcelain? For the floor. I don't know. Whatever is easier to clean. Porcelain. Don't answer it. She'll be worried. Do not answer it. Go! - Turn. - My leg! I can't! I can't guys. Try again! I can't! If you really have something to do with the robbery, say it and we can work it out. What? Who's "we"? Me. Everyone here. It's always the same. It's always the nigger's fault, isn't it? The black guy. The guy from the Northeast. The queer. I just wanted to help. Great help. Well, I don't appreciate your "help". Officer. I'm not an Officer. I resigned from the restaurant last month. This place is nothing without my food. Now can you understand why that bastard won't leave me alone? Mr. Officer... I said I'm not a fucking Officer. How long does the police take to get here? No one called the police, son. I need to talk to you, Djair. Where's my cousin?! Untie him. How much is he paying you? How much? Nothing?! Whores need to value themselves, you know? Didn't I tell you? What? You envy me. Oh Sara. Yes, you do. Envy you? Look at me. Look at you, what you're doing. Where is my wife? Answer. Answer it, damn it! Djair, don't talk to her like that. Oh God. What did you do, Sara? You charmed him with pussy juice, didn't you? You charmed him with pussy juice, right? Shut up! Shut your mouth, faggot! Turn the music on. Sara?! It's just Lucio. At this time? Are you there? Bring him in. - Sara?! No, wait. Let me talk to him. Lucio, what are you doing here? I lost my phone. What time's it? I came back to see if it was on the street. Are you drunk? Did you find it? No... But it may be in the restaurant. No... No, Lucio... Seriously. Now is not a good time. We can talk tomorrow. Ok? Really. My bad. I'll get the phone back on Monday. You know, I thought we had something going on. You thought wrong. You're not stupid, Djair. You know, I even made good comments about you in interviews. This is what I want you to do. Say it like this: "My name is Djair, such and such... and I robbed the restaurant La Barca... I... I am the sole... responsible for the death of two people... Got it? Tell me if you got it! You coward! Show some respect. I'm your boss. It's recording. Your beef with me is not about the kitchen or recipes, none of that. Your beef with me, Inácio, is my long hair. My trimmed eyebrows, my flower fragrance. Your problem is with my ass! Tell me if it isn't. Tell me. Tell me. What did he say to you? Uh? "The owner is a dork"? "Let's ruin the sucker's business"? What did this shithead say to you? Say it! It was him, wasn't it? Say it! It was Sara. We planned it all together. I've never seen this prick in my life. Tell him it was your idea, that you are my girl. It's a lie. Say you are my girl Sara! What's going on? I'll kill you... Are you gonna say you didn't have your eyes on his money? Pretend you like working here? She hates working here. It's a lie. We were going to the beach with your money, dumb-ass! I don't hang around with criminals. Ok? You are dirty, kid. You're filthy! You're filthy! Who are you Sara? I've never seen you, stop saying my name! He's trying to weaken us. He's trying to turn you against me. Please. Please. I'll never betray you. Tell him to stop it, Sara. Please. Sara. Sara... Oh my God... I've never liked this hair of yours. What did he do to the boy? The same he did to my hair. But to the neck. I'm very sorry. For your hair. I've seen a lot in my life. But this... Like this, I don't know. Why didn't he kill you too? He's not in a hurry. I want to teach you something. Give me your hand. Easy, right? Just hold your breath. Take off your clothes. Slowly. Slowly. Lie down. - This shitty restaurant. - Shut up. What? Shut your mouth. Don't tell me to shut up! It's my work you're calling shit. Inácio, why don't you grow up? You're useless. Useless. Are you angry? Oh, give me a break... No, I'm not angry. - No, not at all. - I'm even smiling. I'm always smiling. For you and the customers. Big fucking deal! Some people's smile is other people's suffering. Inácio, you know what, go fuck yourself! Never hang up on me, you coward! Inácio! Is there a problem, Sara? No. I'm tired of everything. Let's get away. We could go to a distant place. In the woods. We wouldn't need clothes. And leave the restaurant? Never. You're really a coward. Never talk to me like that. You're hurting me. Don't talk to me like that. No one tells me what to do. You don't tell me what to do. It doesn't work in here. Just in the dining room. Shit. Shit. C'mon, untie me. C'mon! It's not working! Haven't you untied yourself? - What if he comes back? - The fuck with that! Wait! Where are you going? What are you going to do? I'll be back. Trust me. He won't be back. Where is he? Where is he? What's your best whiskey? Bring me a shot. It's not too much to ask. Bring the blue and a glass. Two. Or will you just watch? Two glasses. Do it. Will you be wanting anything else, "master"? Wait in the kitchen. Do you pity me? Everybody does, because of my lame leg. Do you know I've killed lots of people? Criminals have to die. They weren't all criminals. I killed one with my bare hands. I could just have him arrested, but no... I wanted to see him suffer in my hands. You know? I know well how your mind works. There are many like you out there. Deep, deep down... you are scared to death. How was that? That you killed him? What did you feel? Nothing. The kid was armed, he shot my leg. I still have a bullet in my knee, and no doctor can remove it. It's hell to live in pain. Believe me. You were not born for this life. That's funny. You remind me of my dad. My dad died like you. Mad. No one went to his funeral. No one will miss you. Have you thought about it? That your life doesn't mean anything to anyone? You're already a ghost. Stop looking at me. You look like an animal. So what? There's just you here. No, it's not that. I'm talking about... Do you know when a dog... is put outside? It was him, right? Who kicked you out here? What happened to the chief? He went away. Left you here to die. What? Stop looking at me, playboy! Pig! And he also fucked you, right? We could hear it from here. These men... just want to rule the world. He is your boss, right? - What do you want Djair? To go home. To take a shower, to water my plants, open my restaurant, to get laid. I know what I want Sara. I always knew. What about you? Now that you're back to what you were. What do you want out of life? I called the police. The battery is dead. It ran out after I called. You're bluffing. It's true. You were bluffing. You got it all wrong. I'm not what you think. I am what I want to be. I told you to wait for me in the kitchen. What's the matter? Are you cold? He won't be bothering us anymore. Sit down. Do you know how this is gonna end? I do. First... we put away what's left. Nobody will look in the freezer. Look for what? We'll put them on the menu. Don't they eat horse meat in Japan? But... They are people. Isn't it meat? You're burning with fever. I've never felt better before. Close your eyes. I don't wanna die. Oh dear, that's not up to us to choose. What's the last thing you want to do? I don't know. I want to dance. Very close. With a man, woman, a chicken, anyone. I can't think about anything. What about food? I'll cook you something. Come here. It's my grandmother's beef stew. I've never eaten anything better. Not even close. First, I tenderize the meat... in milk. Way before. Then I cut it... into really narrow strips, and sizzle it in butter and minced garlic. Do you know? Until it comes, that strong marvelous smell. Can you smell it? Then, I chop onions, peppers and tomatoes, then I put some water, two spons of tomato paste... and just a little bit of chili. I like that. Then I cover the pan. Let it simmer... Do you know when it's ready? It's the doneness. When the steam makes the lid tremble softly. Like this... He's gone. Let me go. He's still here, it's your chance. Let me go! C'mon! Do it. Untie me! There is a knife over there. Cut it! Do it! Sara. Sara. Look at me. Come with me. Where's Djair? Tied in the kitchen. We save the best for last. It's your turn. Shut up. Stupid! Let me go. Please. I don't wanna hurt you. Surprise. Drop the knife. Drop the knife. Drop it. I trusted you. We had a pact. You ruined everything. I expected so much more from you. Your problem is that you think small. Small head. Look at me Sara. Look at me. Pay attention. Hey. Oh... Get up. Did you kill him? Let's go, Sara. Who's Sara? Why didn't you just kill me? I need you, Sara. Untie me. Untie me. God... I imagined everything so different. When I close my eyes, I see... the sea. An immense blue sea. I'm wearing a hat. The wind blows my hat away. It's ok. I don't care. Suddenly, you start running towards me. But the sun is too bright. So... I can't see well. If it's you... but I know it's you... because I feel... I can even smell the seaweed... Do you know? That sour smell of the seaweed in the sand. We kiss... and you return to the water, going away. Far, far away. Till you disappear... I can't swim. It's ok. It's inside me.
