Whoo! Whoo! We pray in the Temple of the Low God. You okay, Cap? Yeah. Yeah, I just dozed off. Jesus, Hudson, are you serious? Nobody wants to see that shit, put on a towel. What? They need to breathe. You got a Tic Tac sitting on two acorns, man. Fuck you, are you feeling a little jealous right now? You know what? I'll get you a pump for Christmas. Give it up for Cap! Speech, speech, speech, speech. I don't give speeches in my underwear. Oh, that's never stopped you before. You know, three young women are at home with their family because of the Cap today. It could have been four if I had called it in sooner, if I had stopped him before... You did stop him, all right? Come on, Cap. Yeah. Take the win. Look, you gotta take them somewhere 'cause you are dog shit at basketball, all right? I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow, Cap. Get dressed pumpkin. O'Brien! - What the fuck do you want? - You still mad at me? Yeah, I'm fucking mad at you. Come on. Look, that's never happened to me before, I swear. Look, I drank too much. I've got one rule, I don't fuck dudes that can't drink as much as me. And you fucking snore. Fuck. No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Captain! Officer down! Look at me. Put the shotgun down and walk to me, now! Tell Jessica and Diane that I'm sorry. Tell them I love them. Tell them I'm safe in the arms of my master, my... Cap! As a law enforcement officer, my duty is to safeguard the lives and property, to protect the innocent... Tonight's my first shift. I never thought I'd be wearing this uniform, but now it looks good, don't you think? Okay, see you later. Jesus, Diane, what do you want? How about you answer your phone? Why? Nothing's changed, you're drunk, and I'm still gonna be a cop, am I missing something? - I'm not drunk. - Okay. Your father used to spend so much damn time on these toys. I used to fucking hate them, but now I can't seem to throw them away. This was his favorite. Diane... Okay, this was nice, I'll see you later. Oh, I'm sorry, baby. Baby, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Diane, stop, stop, okay? Look, you don't have to do this. Why can't you just be happy for me? This isn't you, you're acting crazy. Oh, this is from the woman who broke my guidance counselor's arm? You don't know what happened. That's what you always say. - Well, you don't. - Well, then tell me. No? Nothing? Because my father's in the ground and I can't seem to make sense of it. You may not care, but I need to know what happened. I care, but your father was no saint. No, he wasn't. He's everything you weren't. That's right, I'm no killer. Bye, Diane. Jessica. Please! Watch it, piggy. Hello? Hello? Fuck you! Fuck you! Hello? How long have you been here? I just walked in. I'm... I'm Officer... Turn around! I requested this shift. I said turn around. Stop! I said turn around, not walk away. Sir. I went by the new station, it looks like they got their hands full. You talking about those assholes singing on the steps? Yeah, it's been a year since we took out that farm cult pig fucker, and his loons have managed to escape jail time showing their disappointment with a glorified temper tantrum, bussing in from all over. This way, rookie. You get any curb creatures doing walk ups, send them to the new station. The calls have been rerouted so it should be quiet but there's the emergency and station's numbers on the desk. My cell, Officer Grip Cohen, but do not mistake my willingness to leave my personal number as an open invitation for some girl talk. You understand? Yes, sir. I'm sure I'll be fine. You say you volunteered for this shift? Yes, sir. So what is this? You mental? No, sir. I just wanna work where my father worked even if it's for one night. What'd you say your name was? Officer Jessica Loren. You're Will Loren's kid? Yes, sir. You ever see a man die? Excuse me, sir. You know, stare into his eyes as the light fades. That get you off? Do you have a problem with me? - That depends. - On what? It depends on whether or not you're as fucked in the head as your father. My father was the best person I've ever known. Your father was a murderer. He killed my friends then ate his shotgun. So again, why are you here? Because I can't come up with a logical reason why you would request this shift. I'm not here to excuse it, I'm just here to work. So, can I please work? If I cared anymore, I'd call the chief and have you booted, but I don't. Stay out of holding. Asshole. Hello? Officer Cohen? Officer Cohen? Sir, are you okay? No, I can't. Don't you think I've looked? Sir, do you need me to help you? No! Where's my baby? Where's my girl? Where did you go? Why did you leave? Let me help you, okay? Let me call a shelter. Oh, fuck. Seriously? Lanford Police Department. Hello. Hello, little piggy. Lanford Police Department. Did you know that the little piggy that went to the market didn't go there to buy groceries? She went there to be groceries. She was slaughtered. Look, I don't have time for this shit. Prank calling a police station is illegal and I can have you arrested, consider this your warning. Slaughtered in cold blood like the piggies at your station. Who is this? Lanford Police Department. This is Officer Loren at the old station. I'm calling because I received a prank call that needs to be traced. I'm sorry, who's this? Officer Loren. Any relation to Will Loren? Yes, he was my father. I'm sorry to hear that. Excuse me? We got a lot going on over here and tracing prank calls is not at the top of our priorities. Hello? Come on, you're safe now. We're here to help, come on, we'll get you home, girls. Don't worry. Get down motherfucker, don't you move. You are fucking dead! We pray in the Temple of the Low God. Please, if anyone's got any information, I just want my daughter back home safe. Lanford Police Department. This is Officer Loren at the old station. Officer Loren, more prank calls? No, there's a huge pig tied up outside. Well, you don't hear that every day. Well, what should I do with it? Nothing. Just leave it there? It's probably safer if you stay inside. Mm, yeah, why? 'Cause I'm a woman? No officer, I don't know if you noticed on your way in, but we had some assholes causing bullshit on our steps, well, now they're doing it all over town and we're spread a little thin. So, if they left that future bacon on your lawn and something were to happen, I can't send back up. Whether or not you have tits got nothing to do with it. Fine. Look, I'm sorry. There's a lot going on here and you're the closest punching bag. Leave the pig, we'll get to it later. This is Officer Loren at the old station investigating a B&E possible code nine. Sir, get to the ground. I don't know... But I can't remember. I can't remember. Where is she? Roll over on your stomach. Roll over. Hands behind your back. Step inside. - She's here. - Move. My baby. - I said move. - No! She's here. She's here. She's here. She's here! No, no... She's here. She's here. All right, well, let's go. Shut up! No, no! No! Fuck. Come on. No! She's here. Shit, hey, no, no, no. Fuck! Okay... Dispatch, this is Officer Loren at the old station. Officer Loren at the old station in need of assistance. - Still here. - Hello? Still here. Still here. You tell her. No, you tell her. You tell her. Daddy didn't do it, daddy didn't do it. Daddy didn't.. Let me out, let me out. She's here, she's hear. My baby never came home! Sir, give me the flashlight. Please don't make me shoot someone on my first day. Still here, still here. - Let me out! - Still here, Jessica. Dad? Still here, still here, still here, still here. I will maintain courageous calm in the face of danger, scorn, or ridicule, develop self restraint, and be constantly mindful of the wellbeing of others... The welfare of others. I will be exemplary in obeying the laws and the regulations of my department. Hello? Hello! This is Officer Loren, sorry to call you so late. What is it? Your "um" better be followed by the building is on fire or worse to be calling at this hour. When I first arrived at the station, you were yelling at something, I was curious what it was. You were curious and saw fit to wake me up in the middle of the night? Yes, did did you see something? Right now, I see you can't handle a simple shift. You're gonna have to be more- - Did you see something that wasn't really there? Damn it, did you go into holding? Well, I didn't have a choice. A homeless man broke into the station, I... Holding is covered in black mold little girl, the shit is toxic, makes you hallucinate. But I was seeing things before... I told you stay out of it. But sir, I- - You don't care to follow orders- - Yes I do, sir, I do. I'll call the station, have them send over a unit to pick up that bum piece of shit. No sir, You don't understand, I was- - You need me to come over there and hold your hand like a little baby or you gonna shut the fuck up and do your job? I will do my job. And? And I will shut the fuck up. Good, don't call me again. Get out of... - Motherfucker, fuck you. - Hey! Fuck you, fucking asshole! You all right? What? - This your first day? - Yeah. I figured. No seasoned cop would clean me up like this. My daddy was a cop. Really? Now you? I trick to pay the bills, it's not my job. What's your job? I work in sanitation. Some of these fuckers, they like to go after kids. Especially at the truck stops. Happens more than you think, a lot more. So when I see it happen, I take out the trash. So, you do what to them? Hey. Hey. You there? Just drifted there for a moment. You here alone. Why? I wouldn't wanna be here alone, not after what happened. With the officers? Well, I don't know nothing about that. I mean, what happened with the mountain flock. I was there that night in the next cell and they were bragging about what they'd done. Killed that girl, and it wasn't the first time either. What night? The night they hung themselves. They died in an officer involved shooting. - Did you see it happen? - No. I bet my tits and a pack of cigarettes it's the truth. I saw it when they were moving me, had pillowcases over their heads, blood all over the walls, blood all over the... What is it? What's wrong? Not gonna say... anything else... - What are you looking at? - Say... anything more... Hey! From the kingdom of our father, faithful and true, our flock we will follow devoted in you, on this day in his arms... my soul, I will bring. For the king... He rejoices, when the dead sing! Okay, I'm... I'm gonna call you an ambulance, okay? Okay? Sorry, I just drifted there for a moment. I think it's time for you to go. Okay, okay, okay. I just, shit. You have a tampon I could borrow? Can't earn worth a damn with my guts spilling out. - Get out. - Okay, okay. Lanford Police Department. Hello, little piggy. Lanford Police Department. Hang up again and I will fucking kill this girl. You understand? What girl? Oh, I don't know. It's Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe, catch a hostage by her toe. Monica Matthews, do you know that name? What kind of game are you playing? Give it a nibble- Stop! Do you know that name? Yes, she was one of the girls my father rescued. There you go, that's right. What do you want? It's not me, it's John. Trust in his- John Malum is dead. Is he? Did you ever see a tarantula molt? Shed the dead baby. Shed the dead. Let me talk to her. Your daddy started something very important, tonight, we're gonna finish it. Hello? Lanford Police Department. They kidnapped Monica Matthews again. Who did what? - The flock, they... - Hold the line. Officer, did they mention anyone else? No, well, she mentioned my father. So, she knows who you are? She said he started something that they would finish tonight. Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but Monica Matthews disappeared from a party tonight. Two other girls also gone missing, Julie Sims and Anna Cole. All three girls your father rescued a year ago. Look, I'll reach out to the phone company and find out where the call's coming from. You stay by the line. What did you start, Dad? Oh, don't cry little lamb, your body will rot like so many before, but your spirit will feed the demon. You'll make it strong for its long journey. Oh, I hear can whispers, they're saying I'm gonna be the queen. - Oh, you can't hear shit. - Ow! Please, please don't do this. I can hear them too, is that what you want? I can hear the whispers. She don't even look like people anymore. Hello? I know you think I let you down, but I was a good mother when it mattered most. I can't do this right now. Your father didn't want this for you. Seriously, I can't. - I'm fucking weak! - Jesus... Okay, eat something, go to bed, sober up. Diane. Diane! What are you listening to? It's nothing. Where the fuck are you right now? - I have to go. - Turn that shit off. Turn that shit off, off. Turn that shit off. Stop. Turn them off, turn it off. - Stop. - Off! Jessica. - Don't go, still here! - He burns with us, pig! Oh, come on. Pick up. Lanford Police Department. They chained the doors. They chained what? I'm locked in, I'm fucking trapped in here. You're gonna be okay, I'll get a unit over there ASAP with some bolt cutters. Oh, they better come quick or I'm gonna shoot a fucking window out. They'll be there, I promise. But right now, I need you to calm down. Did John Malum die in here? Look, I wasn't there. I've heard rumors, but what's the difference? He's dead. I can't, I can't do this. I can't do this, I thought I could, but I can't. I can't breathe, I can't breathe. I can't do this any more, please... Please, can't you just get me out? Officer, listen, look, I need you there right now because there are three girls missing and you can help. I just wanna get out. This psycho is only calling you because she knows you're Will Loren's kid, that everybody thinks your father's a piece of shit, except for those three girls and their families. Don't let that be undone. The calls are coming from a burner, we're gonna try to get a location, but if she calls you again, get whatever you can out of her, okay? Things are escalating, they're starting fires. So, if you smell smoke, then you can use your firearm to shoot out a window. But right now, I need you there. Okay. Shit, I gotta go, sit tight, help will be there soon. You picked one hell of a first shift. I will maintain courageous calm in the face of danger. To have self restraint, be constantly mindful of the welfare of others. Hello? It's good to see you again, Will. Shut the fuck up. I'm gonna come back for you and all you love. Mark my words. We pray in the Temple of the Low God. John is... John is its vessel. Trust in his plan for you have purpose too. You've seen things you can't begin to explain. We pray in the temple of the low God... And now my words have threatened your family. - Trust in his plan. - You must know if you should pull out your gun, blow my brains out... For you have purpose too. Satan and Christ. My father was a minister. My father was a minister. My mother a mortuary beautician. Just fictions of the church. She painted cadavers like clowns. When she died, we had a closed casket. Did you know that, Will, you are important in all this? In your own little way. You smell like egg covered cat piss. See, my paw was drenched in it, and it don't go away. Gotta cut it out. I was never abused or mistreated. My childhood was pleasant. So, I chopped off his balls and shoved 'em right down his throat. Trust in his plan. Wibble-wobble, wibble-wobble, squish, squish. You have a purpose too. You have purpose too. Squish, squish. We pray in the Temple of the Low God. The devil on my shoulder just isn't what you think it is. My mother wrote me a lullaby, words were pure and true. The song of the Low God, now it's here for you. My mother wrote me a lullaby, her words were pure and true, the song of the Low God, and now it's here for you. The devil on my shoulder just isn't what you think it is. What are you looking at? I'm gonna come back for you and all you love. The devil on my shoulder just isn't what you think it is. Lullaby, her words were pure and true. The song of the Low God! And now it's here for you! Help, help! No! Oh! Hello? Anybody here? Whoa, easy rookie. I called out but I didn't hear an answer. There you go. Sorry. - You okay? - Do I look okay? - You look stressed. - Yeah, I guess. I'm Price. I clipped the last one. This fat, pathetic fuck is Hudson. Unfortunately, he's my partner. I asked you not to call me that. Hi. Look, we're here for the guy in holding. Great. - You got the keys? - Yeah, yeah. Whoa, whoa, why am I grabbing him? Because you need to exercise, asshole. Fuck you, I'm going in there. - You're going in there. - You're going in there. Okay, just give us a sec. Fine. Rock, paper, scissor, shoot. Fuck! I'll be back. Unfortunately, he's not much to look at, but he's phenomenal in bed, so I'll give him that. They told us Captain Loren's daughter would be joining the department. It's kind of... It's kind of fucked up. Put you in here, it's kind of funny though. I wanted to be here. Okay. Well he was a hero till he wasn't, you know, kind of fell off the old rocker. What happened that day? Look, I should probably go check on Hudson. I have a right to know. Okay. If you must know, it was my fault. Yeah, he wasn't acting right, I should have told the chief, but I didn't. He kept watching this interrogation video over and over and over, he said he saw something. The day before your father did what he did, he told me, he said, "Don't go into holding." John Malum is still here. Which reminds me, I got something to show you. Come with me. Yeah. We wanted it destroyed with the rest of the building. Is that... Yeah. Don't touch it, okay? It stays here. We devote ourselves to you as you shall be to us, faithfully, with great purpose and ritual. The Temple Baron will bring forth the Low God and I will be redeemer, king of torment and starless nights, Infinum Malum. I baptize thee in my blood, bound no more to this flesh, but to another. You are one of us. You are one of us, Jessica. She is one of us! She's one of us, let me out! Please, she's one of us! Let me out! Let me out! You have to let me out! You have to let me out! Can you hear them? She must be present on the night of his arrival. She must summon power. She must devote herself. She must participate for great purpose and ritual. Daddy, I wanna go home. I just wanna go home. I'm in here. Betty? Help me, I wanna go home. You've reached Diane, if I don't care about you, fuck off. I'm at the old station where dad worked, call me as soon as you get this. Shh. It's okay. That's my little Jessica. It's gonna be okay. Daddy's gonna find us. You don't know your daddy yet, but he just became a police officer. He's got a glove on his belt and a gun. And when he gets here, he'll beat John until he stops moving. He'll wanna kill him, but he won't because he's a good man. But John never forgets, and he'll find us. Open the fucking door. I thought you were working at the new station. Why would you be here? You lied to me. I lied about a lot of shit. You wanna narrow that down? You were one of them. - How do you know that? - Oh shit, it's true, isn't it? I left your father after we were pregnant because John found me. He just came knocking on the door and he said, your baby was gonna be part of something so big. I believed him. After you were born, I saw things and I needed to get you as far away from them as possible. Your daddy saved us. We ran, we left our lives behind, but a year ago, he found us. John hadn't aged a day, it was like staring at a bad memory. He wanted us back, baby. Will stopped him, but John had plans. He always does. What was I meant to be part of? Diane. Answer me, where are you going? Diane? Diane. Diane. Diane, what are you doing? Mom. Lock the door, stay here. This is Officer Loren, I need fucking backup now. - Please, help me. - Holster, your pistol. - Put the gun down. - Holster, your fucking pistol. Put the gun down. - Do it or I'll kill her. - Put it down! - Holster your pistol now! - Okay, okay. Where are the other girls? It's your night and that's all you have to ask? You're crazy, just like your mother. Let her go, I already requested backup. Nobody's coming, you're on your own. What do you want? It's not what I want, it's what he wants. And he wants you. Well, I'm right here cunt, come and get me. Patience piggy, your time will come. The Low God's been whispering in John's ear ever since you were in your mama's belly. And he knew you would come back to him. You know, I'd hoped I'd be the one by his side. But I know what I'm here for, I have a message for you. You see, you need power for this ritual and there there is power in spilling blood. Please. An animal will give you some. Don't you fucking touch her. But a human will give you more. I'm gonna get you little piggy! I'm coming to get you! Mom? Mom? Mom! Hello? Good, good, you're okay. Listen, we think the flock is planning a raid on the old station. They're here. Fuck, fuck, all right, we'll get you out of there. Is your mother safe? I can't find her. I can't, I can't... How do you know my mother's here? Oh, well, I always keep tabs on her. She was one of my favorite jewels, as devoted as they come. Pure fire. Who is this? I told your daddy that I'd come back for all he loved. Where the fuck is my mother? A vessel must be chosen by its passenger. I was chosen when I was a boy and tonight, the Low God finally comes. What are you doing back here? Where's my mother? This is officer Loren at the old station in need of assistance. I repeat, officer in need of fucking assistance. Dedicated towards... I will constantly strive to achieve... Oh... We're gonna find you, pretty little pig. Come out and find us. I hear you. Super cops saves the day. Rock, paper, scissors. Shoot. No, just kidding. Come in here, come on. We wanna show you something. Yeah, we want to show you something. Stop, stop! I'm here, hold on, you're okay. It's okay. Please, please stay with me. Please. Please. Dad? You don't belong in that uniform. I needed to know, why? How could you hurt all those people? I didn't hurt anybody, baby. I killed them. You hurt mom, you hurt me. I'm a cop, Jessica, that's what cops do. We hurt people, kill them when we have to. And that day... I had to. I got you. Thank you. Strive to achieve... To achieve, strive to achieve those ideals before God. Jessica! Jessica help! The Temple Baron approaches. He is the harbinger! Hi, pretty little pig. Come out and find us. He burns with us! They burn with us! The Low God. He burns with us, pig! Put her in the chair. Feed her to the fucking pig! We pray to the Low God. Tonight he finally comes! She must be present on the night of his arrival. We feast on angel's wings. She must devote herself... And drink from devil's horns. She must participate for great purpose and ritual. They cower like dull, mindless beasts. Rise. Rise, inhuman dark king. In your forgotten tongue, we'll learn to sing, to live immortal forever and true. My spirit, my body, I give it to you. She is one of us. Mom? Your spirit will feed the demon. Your spirit will feed the demon. Your spirit will feed the demon. Your spirit will feed the demon. Your spirit will feed the demon. Your spirit will feed the demon. Your spirit will feed the demon! Your spirit will feed the demon. Your spirit will feed the demon. Will feed the demon. The Temple Baron brought forth the Low God and I am redeemer, King of torment and starless nights. But he chose you too, Jessica, for great purpose and ritual He sent me to find you before you even existed. Queen of sunless dawns. Jessica. Oh my God! Mom! Mom! No... Oh my God. Mom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mommy. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh... Please... Please, Mom, please... I'm sorry. As a law enforcement officer, my duty is to safeguard lives and property, to protect my master. My... The world is such a game, so small, but there must be gains on this board. They must bear fruit. You have your pawns, and I have mine. But I know your every move, all your fears, all your escapes, all for nothing. 'Cause in the end, I'll capture my queen, and our union will strip the veil and call upon the others. Mark my words.
