[class chuckles] MR. WHITMAN: Charlie! [students chuckle] MR. WHITMAN: I said, would you like to solve the problem on the board? I know it'll be easy for you, considering all the "attention" you're paying to your class work. [♪♪♪] MR. WHITMAN: Charlie! PRINCIPAL GOODWIN: This isn't even the first incident. She's been through a lot with the divorce and all. Maybe you could give her a break? Break from the rules isn't doing her any favors, Mrs. Mitchell. [sighs] I realize that your home situation has been difficult, but I can't have students thinking-- Can't have students thinking, can we? -PRINCIPAL GOODWIN: What? -Nothing. [chuckles] I might have an idea of where Charlotte gets some of her attitude. Just so I understand, Charlie isn't being disruptive to the other students? PRINCIPAL GOODWIN: Well, no... BETH: And she turns in all of her assignments on time? PRINCIPAL GOODWIN: She does. And she has an A in the class? PRINCIPAL GOODWIN: That's not really the point. She spends her time daydreaming and she doesn't apply herself to her school work. BETH: Seems like she might be bored. Needs more of a challenge. Fine. I'll talk to her. Good. I'm glad we could see eye to eye on this. BETH: Me too. And by the way, isn't daydreaming what you're supposed to be doing when you're a kid? [♪♪♪♪] Charlotte Grace, you've got to stop doing this. I can't keep leaving work. You're going to get me fired. I saw that. It's not fair. Look, I know you're hurting. But being angry all the time isn't helping you. Whatever. It's not like you would understand. I miss how things used to be. You know sometimes, when I daydream, I go to another place. I feel normal. You are normal. But you have to pay attention in class. But it's so boring. Just learn to play the game and stay out of trouble. The game is dumb. Sometimes. But you're not gonna win acting like this. [sighs] And watch the attitude, okay? CHARLIE: Sure thing. I'll get right on that. TROY: Hey, kids. Hey, dad. Hi. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Nobody gets through without a hug and a kiss. Love you, Mikey. Be good. MIKEY: Love you, too. Come on. I'm a little too old for that. You're never too old for that. Come over here. Love you. Have fun. TROY: You know, you can come to dinner with us, Bitsy. Might confuse the kids. And don't call me, "Bitsy". Oh, but you used to like it so much when I called you that. Come on, Troy. We've been through this. It's time to move on. [chuckles] God. All right, Beth. Look, I need you to do me a favor. I need you to pick up the kids tomorrow. You're serious? I have to work late. And you barely see them as it is. Well, I'm gonna get to see them some. You know, you can't just change plans whenever the mood strikes. I'm sorry. Can't keep doing this to me. Or to them. They need to know they can depend on you. You know what? I think you lost the right to tell me what to do, Bitsy. So, are you gonna pick 'em up? -Yeah. -TROY: Good. Thanks. [sighs] [♪♪♪♪] Why you would wanna work on a ranch is beyond me. Oh, you know I'm sentimental. Plus, that land's been in my family for generations. [chuckles] Sentimental ain't worth a dime, man. I don't know. Some things are worth holding on to. [♪♪♪♪] TROY: You know what, man, I love those kids. I love them. You know, I would do anything for them. Anything! Trust me. Anything? -What? -You'd do anything for me? Yeah. Of course. What do you want? What do you want? I want a horse. Oh yeah. Yeah. Wait. Uh, the little uh, the little collectible... What are those-- what are those called again? No. I want a real live horse. [Troy chuckles] TROY: I didn't mean anything that big, sweetheart. You said anything. I can't pull something like that together right now, honey. -Maybe later. -CHARLIE: How much later? -Later. -What if I had my own money? Where would you even put it? Okay. Say I found a way to buy it and found somewhere to put it. Please, it's all I've ever wanted. Well, I mean I guess. I mean if you could do all that, then why the hell not? Really? You promise? Yeah, sure. I promise. [Charlie chuckles] I'm gonna get a horse! You're gonna keep that promise? Make this happen? I don't know, dude. She'll forget about it in the morning, man. She's just a kid. I don't think it works like that. Not with a horse. [sighs] [♪♪♪♪] Why would he promise that to Charlie? Where is he anyway? I uh, he fell asleep. BETH: More like sleeping it off. Yeah, I've just known him for 20 years. I'm not his keeper. How am I gonna break the news to Charlie? But I could take her looking for a horse just for kicks. No need to go to all that trouble. It's not-- no trouble. Not to mention, what if you find one? Highly unlikely. Worst-case scenario? Like I got a barn, some pasture. Be nice to have a little activity around there again. So, you're really gonna do this? If it's okay with you. Seems like a shame to break a promise. Wasn't your promise. No need for her to think that us men are going to let her down. Little late for that. How's she ever gonna learn to trust anybody when she just keeps getting disappointed? You're still talking about Charlie? [sighs] CLINT: You know, Beth, these bonfires aren't the same without you here. [♪♪♪] At the table. No food in the living room. That's right, Half Pint. Gotta listen to those rules. There's a place for rules. Oh, I know. Clean your room. Do your homework. Make good grades. Grades are important. You wanna go to college, right? Maybe. I don't know. Don't mess with me, Charlie. You will study, you will make good grades and you will go to college. That goes for you, too, mister. Hey, what'd I do? BETH: Hey, what's that? FMB. Farmers Market Bulletin. Never heard of it. Where'd you get that? I subscribe. Since when? Since forever. [♪♪♪♪] Good morning! CLINT: Mornin'! You ready? Hey, Max. -Mornin', Beth. -Mornin'. Uh, I, I guess we should roll. Good luck, I think. Well, at any rate, have fun. Yes, ma'am. That's the plan. Buckle up. Okay, I have a plan. A plan? Where'd you have the time to come up with a plan? Well, I read somewhere that luck is when opportunity meets preparation. Hm, wise words. Well, this might be my lucky day. True. What's your budget? Uh, a little over $300. Pretty tight. Yeah. But my horse is out there somewhere. Waiting for me. Well, they say third time's the charm, right? -Yup. -Okay. Next one is right see that driver right there? Right there. Mmhmm. [Charlie sighs] Okay, last one. Right over here on the left. Okay. [♪♪♪♪] [sighs] I really thought today was gonna be my lucky day. What would you even done if you had found one? Love it. [chuckles] Quit playing. [♪♪♪] CHARLIE: Wait, stop! Did you see that horse? Stop. Seriously, she could spook easily. So, you guys stay here. I'm gonna get the wire cutter. -CHARLIE: Right. -Right. Whoa, take it easy. Easy, easy. Dang it, Charlie, I told you. This could be dangerous. CHARLIE: Pretty scary. It could have been. CHARLIE: Hi. It's okay. You think you can hold him? CHARLIE: Yeah. I think he likes me. CLINT: I think he does. CHARLIE: It's okay. CLINT: It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. CHARLIE: It's okay. It's one lucky horse. A little salve on those scratches and he's gonna be fine. So, what do we do now? How should I know? Well, you're the grown-up. [chuckles] Well, he's banded and that's the lead line. So, he probably lives around here. We just need to find the owner. He wouldn't run away if he was happy. They probably just left the gate open. We can't just take him. We can't just leave him on the side of the road. You told my mom the other night that we could use your barn. You heard that? Dang it. Come on, boy. Come on. CHARLIE: [indistinct speech] We did it! Isn't he beautiful? Beautiful isn't exactly the word that comes to mind. So, what's the deal? It's a long story. BETH: I've got all night. [♪♪♪♪] BETH: I thought you said there wasn't a chance this could happen. -CLINT: here wasn't. -Beg to differ. -What are you gonna do? -Me? Yes. You did this. Wait a minute. No. You're in this. Well, I-- I meant what I said about using my barn. Look, I'm not looking for charity, I'm just looking for a solution. Let him stay here for now. Someone's missing something this big, they're sure to miss it. I don't know. Let her have fun. I just don't want her to get attached and then get her heart broken. I know the feeling. [sighs] She's a natural with him. CHARLIE: I'm gonna name him Chango. CLINT: Chango and Charlie, that's cute. BETH: Honey, we're gonna find his owner and he's gonna have to go home. You can't get too attached. CHARLIE: Whatever. He still needs a name. That kid is so stubborn. Yeah. Wonder where she gets that. -Hey! -Oh! Ha, ha. Easy, slugger. It's my pitching arm. Is it? Oh yeah. So, Chango huh? Not a bad name. Let me show you something. [♪♪♪♪] Whoa. Is that you? CLINT: Well, long time ago. No big deal. Why'd you quit? Took a bad spill. Doctor said I couldn't compete anymore. That was my lucky hat. Only wore it when I competed. Lucky hat. Did it work? It did, until it didn't. I've only ever ridden English. I don't know Western. Can you teach me? I reckon so. It's not as easy changing what you know, but want something bad enough, it's worth working for. I want it. Then let's do it. Maybe we should wait a little while longer. Or Clint should try him first. Mom, I trust him. And he trusts me. Chango wants me to ride him first. Tell you what, I'll hold him, put your foot in the stirrup. Nice and slow. That's it. Now horses, they like to mirror us. You can't tell a lie. So, if you're calm, they're gonna be fine. That horse can take care of her. BETH: How do you know? Trust me. Troy always says that. I'm not Troy. I didn't lie to you back then, and I'm not gonna start now. What do you mean, lie to me then? I'm just saying, I've always been straightforward with you. I got a good feeling about this pony. BETH: So, how was it? Like amazing. Oh, you think that was cool, wait til you try something other than a jog. That horse has got some moves. Just remember, Charlie, he isn't ours. We've notices all over town. He could be gone any minute. So, you keep telling me. You know, Beth, this horse could be sticking around. I wouldn't count on it. [indistinct chatter] ZACH: Hey, heard you found a horse. I heard you found a nag. Where did you hear that? My dad works with Clint, I mean Mr. Holden. My groomer heard it at the feed store. Great, everybody knows everything around here. Come on, my yearbook class is on your hallway. Walk with me and you can tell me about this mystery horse. You've got to be kidding me. [♪♪♪♪] CLINT: Atta girl. Still doesn't love the bit, but he's getting used to it. Hey. Why doesn't he like it? See the scarring around his mouth? It's from someone using a hard bit and a heavy hand. Why would somebody do that? CLINT: Well, some people think that some horses need a little bit more control, but you still gotta do it right. Can't just jerk 'em around. And Chango's got a soft mouth. Don't worry, boy. We're not gonna hurt you. CLINT: What do you think? Ready to do something a little faster? I thought you'd never ask. CLINT: Turn him around and go the other way. I'm confused. CLINT: A horse is all about feeling. They can feel a mosquito land on their back in the middle of a wind storm. I don't get it. Gentle in what you do. But firm in the way you do it. All right. Use your legs to steer the horse. The pressure from your legs to steer. Gotta get your girl some boots. Can't keep doing this in her sneakers. Boots are expensive. And we don't know how long we'll even have Chango. Or whatever his real name is. There are some good consignment stores. Probably get a pair really cheap. [sighs] This is about to get out of hand. It already is. I'm talking about Charlie. Uh-huh. We've had signs all over town and still no response from any of the flyers. CLINT: You just start thinking about a long-term plan. BETH: We. We need a plan. You know, I got I lot of stuff going on in my world than keep trying to find a home for a lost horse. Like what? Let me show you. It's not much, but I want you to see this. This is a work in progress. Okay? -BETH: Okay. -CLINT: All right. What is this? This is my workshop. I've dreamed that someday I'm gonna open up a store and sell a bunch of furniture that I make myself. It's a beautiful dream. That's not the most beautiful thing in this room. I've always thought so since the day we first met. You did? But you were so into what's her name? -What? -What was her name? Mandy, oh no. No, she-- she-- I mean she tried, she was a stage level five stalker. But we never went out. But Troy said that you and her were... Well, he lied. Why didn't you ever say anything? CLINT: 'Cause Troy was my friend. And uh, but you guys-- you guys started dating right away. And then you got married and had kids. Oh. I don't know if you-- you noticed, but uh, I've gotten very attached to you and the kids. I'm just not ready. And like you said, Troy is your friend. Yeah. He had his shot, and he blew it. But if you're not ready, I respect your wishes. Thank you. I'm hoping you'll have a change of heart. How's it going with your new horse? -What? -I said, how's it going with your new horse? Oh, way better. We've been practicing like every day now. Have you heard about the Junior Rodeo coming up? The what? Oh, it's so fun. There's a bunch of events but uh... I do the calf roping. A lot of the girls do the barrel racing though. I don't really know much about that stuff. You can learn if you start practicing. I mean I bet Clint could teach you. He used to rodeo. Didn't you hear? She can't compete. She barely even knows how to ride. -[friends chuckle] -I didn't say that! Madison's just afraid you'll beat her. You wouldn't stand a chance. Maybe I should enter barrels. I mean, I don't have anything to lose. But somebody expecting to win? They have everything to lose. [grunts] We knocked it down four times today. We're getting better. Oh. Whoa, boy! Whoa! Am I in trouble? Hardly. That wasn't half bad. A guy at my school said that there's a Junior Rodeo coming up. Can I enter? I'd make a bet that that horse has seen barrels before. I could teach you to ride him, if you like. That'd be awesome! With permission from your mom, of course. Of course. I don't like it. It's dangerous. Mom. Come on, I'm not a baby. You're my baby. Actually, it's a lot safer than you think. I could teach her how to do it right. And your school work. You already spend too much time in the barn and not enough time in the books. Not to mention, her dad will never let her. -Yes, he will. -BETH: Doubtful. Why do you always have to pick on dad? BETH: Charlie, if you only knew-- Ask him to come out and watch her ride. Fine. If your dad says yes, you can do it. But if I see any problems with your school work, it's over. Glad you two are satisfied. Ask your dad to meet us at the barn when he comes to pick you up on Friday. [♪♪♪] You doing your homework? Yeah. BETH: Good girl. Don't stay up too late. Okay. BETH: You sure he's safe for Mikey? Oh, he takes care of his rider. He's a good horse. You're lucky to have him. BETH: Well, he's not exactly ours. More like on temporary loan. And every day, Charlie falls more in love with him. Maybe I need to find something to distract her. -Like what? -I don't know. Sleepovers? Friends? Soccer? I hate to tell you, but a few sleepovers ain't gonna cure what she's got. And what's that? The girl's horse crazy. Ain't no cure. This is cool. If you really like it and you practice, you could do it by yourself. Want me to teach you, Mini-Mike? Mom would never let me. We don't have to mention it to mom. It'll be just me and you. Fun. Aren't you falling in love? What? With the horse. [whistles, clicks] Come on. Your turn. [sighs] I've never been on a horse before. Trust me, you're gonna love it. You keep saying that. -CLINT: Oh, look -[chuckles] I'll tell you, you look good on a horse. Thank you. Wow, Bitsy. I didn't know you liked to ride. You guys. How's it goin'? Good. First time. Hey, it's uh-- it's great you got my buddy there, giving you the ride around, huh. I was just-- just trying to help out. TROY: Oh well. That's real nice of you, Clint, looking out for my family like that. CHARLIE: Do you wanna see me ride? Of course, angel. That's why I'm here, isn't it? [sighs] So, no one's come to claim it, huh? Nope. We put ads, and signs, and flyers all over town. What else can you do? I don't know. Maybe uh, you shouldn't get too close to something that doesn't belong to you. Someone's liable to claim it. I'll take that into consideration, Troy. Yeah, I'm sure you will. Anyway, I'm here to see if my girl's a cowgirl. Giddy up. [indistinct speech] [Troy chuckles] TROY: A good show. -So, can I enter the rodeo? -TROY: Of course. I'm gonna have front-row seats to see my girl win. Well, I probably won't win, but it will be fun to compete. No, no, no, no, no. You are gonna win. Trust me. [sighs] Well, that was interesting. I don't blame the guy. It's getting late. Do you want some help cleaning the barn? It'll go by faster. Now, why would I want it to go by faster? So, you can get rid of me and have some peace and quiet. Tell you what. Why don't you let me make you dinner? -You cook? -Mmhmm. Hmm. A man of many talents. Mmhmm. But, if you remember our most recent conversation, I'm just not ready to change my mind. Woman, it is just dinner. I thought after today, you'd be too tired to go home and cook yourself. And just would've been really nice to be able to eat dinner with someone, but... It is tempting. Yeah. And I am tired. Alright, cowboy. But last one through the barn has to clean the stalls. What? [chuckles] BETH: [indistinct speech] -Oh. -Oh. -Sorry. -No, you're good. What's so interesting? Oh, just a little light reading. So, you're really gonna do it. I mean, I'll enter. But I don't know how well I'll do. -Well how's your training going? -Pretty good. I feel like Chango's the one teaching me the barrels. Stay with it. I can't wait to see you beat Madison. Well, that's not why I'm doing it. Yeah, but it would feel pretty good. We should go riding sometime. I know some nice trails around Clint's place. What are you doing Saturday? Um, practice, and chores, and stuff. Well, see if it's cool and I'll ride over in the afternoon and get you. Sounds like fun. -Bye. -Bye. Mom, Charlie's falling asleep at the table again. BETH: Mikey, don't tattle. Charlie, go take a shower. It's late and you smell like a barn. It's my favorite smell. They should make a perfume. Oh yeah, I bet that would be a big seller. Now go get cleaned up. I'd buy it. [♪♪♪] Here. Hey Mr. Holden! Hey, Zach! How're you doing? What's your pa up to this weekend? Well, he's... he's cutting fields, but mom says if he gets done on time, he can watch the ball game. "Happy wife, happy life". Yes, sir. I've heard my mom use that one before. How's it going, Charlie? CHARLIE: Hi, Zach. Your horse is kind of a beast. Oh yeah. Hercules is my buddy for sure. Hercules? Oh, was... his real name is something long and fancy that I can never remember, but I knew he was a Hercules on the inside. This is a first for Chango. So, he's not used to it. Slow and steady. Yes, sir. You can count on us. And don't come home too late or I'll get a hundred calls from your mama. Yes, sir, we won't. So how come you transferred to our school in the middle of last year? Well, um, my parents got divorced and then when we sold our old house we moved closer to my mom's work. Must have been rough. Yeah, it was pretty bad. Not easy being the new girl? Most kids are nice, except for... -Madison. -Madison. Yeah. Yeah, she's tricky. But she's not all bad. Really? Okay, she's pretty bad but, I've known her since kindergarten. She has her own stuff to deal with. Her parents are super-rich. Oh, spare me. Such a tough problem. Spend hardly any time with her. And her dad puts all this pressure on her. -CHARLIE: For what? -Everything. Sports. Grades. And especially on her barrel racing. They got a whole stable with trainers and staff. Still sounds like a pretty good life. -Don't you get it? -No. It's all work for her, and then she-- she's in trouble if she doesn't win. She never gets to ride for just fun. Yeah, it does sound pretty bad. No wonder she's so mean. Speaking of fun, let's pick up the pace. Charlie, wait. Slow down! Charlie! Charlie, where are you? Charlie? Charlie. You okay? We took a tumble. ZACH: What happened? Well, I was just trying to go faster and he slipped on some rocks. We should call for help. There's no service. Alright, look he-- he should be okay, but just-- just to be safe. Give me your reins and let's-- let's-- let's get you back. [sighs] It just goes straight to voicemail, whenever I call. I'm just-- I'm so sorry. [♪♪♪] BETH: What happened? Where have you been? Why didn't you call? CLINT: Beth, slow down. Slow down. BETH: Are you okay? Mom, I'm fine, but Chango isn't. Okay, well, let's get him in and then we can talk. BETH: How well you listen right now is gonna play a big part in whether or not you get to keep riding. Mom, you can't just do that! I care about Chango more than anything! He's not safe. You could have got hurt and you scared me to death. Mrs. Mitchell, it's-- it's all my fault. I wanted to go off the trail. I thought it would be more fun. She could have said "no". She didn't know the way back. And Chango didn't do anything wrong. He just slipped on a wet rock. Wait, no, Zach. No, that's not-- It was my responsibility. Please do not punish Charlie for my bad judgement. Please. I'll think about it. But for now, stay off that horse. Think of yourself as grounded. I think we should get rid of him. Whoa, that seems a bit harsh. BETH: Are you really gonna tell me what's best for my kid? I wouldn't even dream about that. Seriously, what do you think any good parent would do here? You know, Beth? I don't even know what it takes to be a parent. But I do have a suggestion. And what's that? You can discipline to encourage or you can discipline to discourage. Same for animals as it is for humans, I think. What's that? Encouraging tends to feel better and seems to last a bit longer. I don't know. I didn't sign up for any of this. Look, this could have happened to anybody. And Charlie didn't even get hurt. And the horse took the brunt of it. Maybe they deserve a second chance. I'm not big on second chances. You think about it? Okay? He's gotta be on stall rest and hand-walking for the next couple of days. Just don't make a decision you might regret later. I'll think about it. How's it going, Charlie? -Why did you do it? -What? You know exactly what. I didn't want you to get in trouble. Why not? You know why. I like you. And I like you, too? No, I mean I like you, like you. We're talking here. It's my desk. Hey, just chill for a minute. Go sharpen a pencil or something. As you were saying... What was I saying? That you like me. That that you like me, like me. Is this some joke? Something you and Madison made up to make me look like an idiot? Wha-- are you kidding me? Why would you even think that? I don't know. Maybe I've seen all those movies, where the cool guy asks out the geek girl, and then the joke is on her. If that's what you think, just forget what I said and uh, keep on hating life. It's working out great for you so far. [indistinct chatter] It's just too dangerous. I think Chango needs to go. Mom, he was real nice when I rode him. Once. Once you rode. Actually, I have a few times. What? When? I just wanted to try. Plus, I kinda like hanging out with Charlie. I like hanging out with you too, squirt. So, now, you've both been lying? Mom, we were just trying to spend time together. Yeah. Yeah, quality sibling time. It's supposed to be a healthy thing. I'm not too happy about any of this right now. Look, just hear them out, Beth. First of all, I lied. I know. You just said that. No, I mean about something else. You know, they say the more you lie, the easier it gets. Well, I just sat there and Zach took the blame for me. I'm the one who went off on the trail. I'm the one who went too fast. I'm the one to blame for everything. You're not making a real strong case for keeping the horse. Mom, I love him. And he loves me, too. Please let me keep him. Fine. But not one more screw-up. Now, let me get this straight. When you say you love him, are you talking about Chango or the boy? -Zach. His name is Zach. -What? No! -What? -Which-- which one? -No, wait. -I think it was maybe-- -I thought it was Zach. -No, no, no... Wait. Now, I wanna know what this is. Are you talking about Zach? -I just-- I-- I-- -I think it's Zach. -No, no, no. I-- -She loves Zach, but she wants to ride the horse. No, no, no. No. For what it's worth, I think you made the right decision. Why am I not surprised? Charlie, saddle up. We've gotta a lot of work to do. Rodeo is coming up fast and we lost a lot of time. Mom? Mom? [♪♪♪] CHARLIE: Can we go faster? CLINT: Not yet. We gotta do some yoga for that horse first. What the heck does that mean? Just some stretching. He's got to remember how to bend. Just start out with some circles, both directions. Then we'll do figure eights. Alright, that's nice. Nice. Nice and easy. Atta girl. I still don't see the point in this. You want this? Yeah. More than anything. Then, do what I tell ya. CHARLIE: Easy. Ah, okay. Here's one of the little things that matters. When you're riding barrels, look for the pocket. What's that? The area around the barrel. You wanna push past that. Horses always go where their rider is looking. So, look ahead to where I wanna go? Exactly. Anything else? Yeah. Have fun. No sense doing all of this unless you're having the time of your life. Hey, dad, it's me. CHARLIE: Uh, wanted to make sure you remembered that my competition is next weekend. Call me back. Love you. Bye. You know, he may not make it. He said he'd be there. He might have to work or something. Why do you always do that? What? Always think the worst about dad. I'm just saying, don't get your hopes up too much. He'll show. Hear you're competing in the Junior Rodeo. Yes, sir. You never got a lead on that horse you found? No, sir. Darndest thing I ever heard of. Hm. Well, good luck young lady. [chuckles] Thank you, Mr. Johnson. She any good? Got a better than fair shot at surprising a few people. I expect I know who one of those people might be. CLINT: I'll bet you do. Tell you what, Charlie Mitchell. You beat that Farnsworth gal, Johnson Feed Store might just be your first sponsor. [chuckles] Thank you. ZACH: Hey, Mr. Holden. Zach. How you doing? I haven't seen you since the incident. Ah, about that. There's something I need to tell you. That you lied about what happened. I told 'em. Great. Thanks a lot. No, no, no. I told them that it was my fault. I still lied. Yes, you did. And you got to remember, a man's word is his bond. Reputation is everything. Yes, sir. Fella must really like someone if he's willing to lay that on the line. Yes, sir. He must. Well, we'd best get going. Good luck at the rodeo. We'll be rooting for you. Oh, and uh, good luck with that other thing, too. [♪♪♪] MR. WHITMAN: Okay, everyone, books away. No more talking till the bell rings. I'm sure everyone here remembers that this test is 30% of your final grade, so it's a big deal. [♪♪♪] CLINT: You're still slicing that second barrel. When you let him turn too soon, he's out of position for the next one. Try again. Uh-oh. Hi Beth. BETH: Charlotte Grace, get off that horse right now. CHARLIE: What's the matter, mom? BETH: Did you really think you wouldn't get caught? I'm so confused. Let me help you. What if I told you I just got off the phone with your Principal. Mom, I really don't know where you're going with this. And why am I not surprised you'd lie about it. It's not like we haven't seen this before. Now, get off the horse. How can I lie when I don't even know what I did wrong? Apparently, your algebra exam came back with one of the highest scores in the class. Get off the horse. And I'm in trouble for that? I had an A in there anyway. Your teacher didn't think anything about it. Until he found out you cheated. What? Mom, I would never. Don't bother. He has proof. No, there must be some mistake. I don't cheat. The mistake was letting you keep this horse and spend so much time out here that you couldn't keep up with your schoolwork. Mom, what are you saying? I'm saying you're done. You're not coming out here anymore. Beth, can we just talk about this? BETH: You stay out of this. She cheated. She lied. And now for the icing on the cake she's suspended from school and getting a zero in that class. Do you know what this means? Mom, I promise I didn't do it. Let's just hear Charlie's side of the story and maybe we can figure out exactly what happened. You know, I partially blame you for this, too. Me? You just had to take her out looking for a horse. Well, here, he's yours. -Take him. -What? No. Beth, can we just talk about this? BETH: You know this is hard for me, too. Yeah, I'll bet. It's not always easy having to be the bad guy. Well, this one doesn't seem to be exactly breaking your heart. Look, Charlie, you know I always want what's best for you. And Chango grew on me. But you're in big trouble. I didn't do it! I aced that exam on my own. Look, all I know is you lied about being on the trail with Zach and you lied about teaching Mikey to ride. That was part my idea, too. I cannot believe this. I think I'm just gonna go live with dad. No! You're not going to live with Troy. Where's your dad been through any of this? You just can't count on him when the chips are down. Stop talking about dad like that! You know it's true. He means well for the most part, and I'll always love him for giving me the two of you, but it's always a coin toss if he's going to be there when it's crunch time. So, don't bring it up again. Hey. Charlie wasn't here today. BUDDY: So? She never misses a day. Are you really trying to figure out girls? Just give up now. Didn't you hear? She got suspended. No way. You're joking. I heard that little Miss Smarty Pants got caught cheating. No way. Apparently, Mr. Whitman found her cheat sheet or something. She wouldn't do that. I guess I'm not surprised you'd take up for that. Stop it. Just shut up. Mr. Whitman? Zach. What can I do you for? She didn't do it. Didn't do what? Charlie. She would never cheat. Well, I found proof to the contrary. What kind of proof? I can't say. You know teachers can't discuss students with anyone but the parent. I know her. Well, I know what I found. How can I help prove she didn't cheat? I guess we could have a discussion about a "hypothetical situation". Fair enough. Now, tell me about this "proof". Oh, it was good. Low tech, low risk. Not like some of these other students that use cell phones and calculators. So, what was this low-tech thing? Rubber band bracelet. This. This is what I'm talking about. That's not anything. Mr. Whitman, Charlie got set up by someone and I know who. It was Madison. That's not possible. I mean, the-- the Farnsworth's are a fine, upstanding family in this community. Now look, son, you-- you can't go around accusing people just to save your friend. With all due respect, sir, I'm 100% sure that Charlie didn't cheat and I'm gonna prove it. Charlie did it. Case closed. ZACH: Fair enough. We'll see about that. I'm going to Principal Goodwin. MR. WHITMAN: All right. Like I said, you can't discuss a student with anyone but a parent. Mr. Holden? CLINT: Hey, over here, Zach. It's awfully quiet out here. Yup. I heard what happened. What version? She didn't do it. I'd like to believe that, too. No, I'm-- I'm serious. She got set up. By Madison Farnsworth. Farnsworth? You don't say. I do say. [♪♪♪] PRINCIPAL GOODWIN: You claim that Madison did this. I saw her and her friends wearing the bracelets. I didn't see Charlie wearing one. You should be looking at their test scores. PRINCIPAL GOODWIN: You just can't go around accusing people of planting evidence. But you can go around accusing people of cheating? And then kick them out of school for it? It's school policy. Look, I'm not an expert here. But in a court of law, you're proven guilty by beyond reasonable doubt. So, if it's good enough for the courts, shouldn't it be good enough for a school? I'm sorry, but without any proof... I do have proof. Is that enough to at least make you ask some questions? BETH: Reasonable doubt. Right there. Well, in light of Zach's contribution, perhaps we can negate Charlie's suspension. What about failing the test? What about it? Let her retake it. And Mr. Whitman can watch. If she passes, drop the whole thing. BETH: Seems reasonable. Might owe an apology even, before suspending the Farnsworth girl. Let's not get carried away. I'll let Charlie retake the test and we'll go from there. [♪♪♪♪] CHARLIE: Why are we here? Just wait and see. CHARLIE: What is going on? Charlie, I owe you the biggest apology. I know you didn't cheat on that test. I'm so sorry. You are? Zach and Clint never doubted you. Zach and I went to your principal and we got everything straightened out. How did you manage this? Well, we made your principal an offer she couldn't refuse. -You threatened her? -No. No. It's just an expression. What kind of criminal do you think I am? I'm gonna sleep so much better tonight knowing that. So, what happened? Well, we had a material witness and a little bit of leverage. Well, why don't we all just bring it in for a group hug? Come on, everybody. -Bring it in. -[chuckling] Okay, Charlie, this is game day. There'll be a lot of people there. CHARLIE: I get it. I know you do. I just don't want you to get intimidated by all the fancy things that don't matter. Like what? It's gonna be a lot of money there. Trailers that are nicer than some people's homes. Horses that cost more than most people's cars. Money doesn't mean anything. Well, money can mean some things, but it doesn't mean everything. What counts is... Opportunity means preparation. Heart. Nothing can beat your heart. You have all the heart in the world for this. No matter what happens, I'm so proud of you. ANNOUNCER: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the State finals in barrel racing. [people cheering] You ever play Pick up 52? -No. -You wanna play? Yeah, sure. We're gonna play it all the way through. -Yeah. -All right. -Mom, what's that? -It's for you. Open it. No way! I'm so sorry I ever doubted you. I just wanted to make sure you get to go to college. It's okay. I was a total jerk. Whatever. I'm so proud of you. Here. Go, try this on. [Charlie chuckles] [chuckles] Oh, wow. You look amazing. CLINT: Yeah, you do. You need to fuel up before the ride. Let's go get 'em something to eat. Whoa. CHARLIE: What, Shorty McShort Shorts? Doesn't exactly look like you. CHARLIE: Is it bad? I don't know. You just look fancy. Mom got it for me. Man, sometimes, I get emotional whiplash from trying to follow you two. [Charlie chuckles] Hey, what's up? Are you mad? Not really. But I hate it when you call me names. I don't call you names. Mini-Mike? Short Stop Shrimp? Shorty McShort Shorts? I'm just kidding around. Well, no one has to keep reminding me that I'm shorter than everyone. Aww, I'm sorry, bud. I didn't know it was a thing. It's just my way of showing affection. And a reminder of my worst fear, that I may be done growing. Dude. Never again. Okay, pinky swear. Pinky swear. So, you actually look awesome. You nervous? Yeah, I kind of just want to go home. Okay, what kind of example would quitting set for me? I'm just joking. Now go kick some... Hey! ...butt. Jeez, what did you think I was gonna say? Hey uh, have you ever heard of Pick Up 52? [♪♪♪] You nervous? Yeah. I got something for ya. Isn't this your lucky hat? Not anymore. Remember what I told you about a horse being a mirror for your soul? I don't think my dad made it. Later. Focus on you. All that matters right now is getting to the next round. What do you mean? Well, a good time will get us to the finish. Anything under 19.5 should get us there. Do you think I'm ready? You've asked me every which way you can, Charlie. There's only one thing that matters. Do you think you're ready? Can you take this to the finals? I think me and Chango can do anything. Me too. [indistinct announcement in background] Is that the horse you got from the Lost and Found? Good luck with that. [sighs] Nice girl. [crowd cheering] Hey, boss. Hey, yeah, it's me. Hey uh, I got news. Mmhmm. You remember that horse, that little pony that went missing a while back? Yeah. Yeah, well, I think I just found him. Uh-huh. Well, I'm sitting here looking right at it. On my way to rodeo. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you'd come over here and take a look for yourself. You bet. Hey, Zach. Thanks again for getting me out of trouble. Not many people would have done that. It's the right thing. I know you didn't cheat. Never doubted? Never. I think you're pretty awesome. Charlie, I've always thought you were pretty awesome. CHARLIE: Yeah, and then like, Madison was just like, "Good luck with that." [chuckles] -Really? -Yeah. -Come on. -That's typical Madison. -That's so-- that's so dumb. -Yeah. Hey! Let go of my horse! Hey! What's going on? We seem to have confusion here. This horse belongs to me. No, you're wrong. Chango's ours. Mac? What's going on? Sorry, Clint, but it all checks out. Mr. Buchanan owns the horse. No, you're-- you're lying. We found him ages ago. We put up flyers and nobody came. Doesn't matter. He's mine now. You lost him and didn't even look for him. You only care now, because we placed in the barrels. Maybe we can talk about this. We could buy him off you fair and square. Nothing to talk about. At least, let her finish the rodeo. She's in the finals on Sunday. Not my problem. Mac? Sorry, man. Nothing I can do. BUCHANAN: Step aside, son. We'll figure something out. [cries] Charlie, you've got to eat something. I'm not hungry. Look, I know this is tough, but we'll get through this. You never wanted me to have him anyway. Charlie, none of us wanted you to lose that horse. Trust me on that one. I'm done with trust. Never thought I'd say this, but we've got to get that horse back. [sighs] -[sighs] -CLINT: We need to talk. Why should I care about anything you have to say? You used that horse to get close to my family! You're the one who told Charlie she could have a horse. You can't blame me or Chango for this. I'm really pissed at you right now. Yeah, I get it. Anger is a lot easier to handle than grief. You don't know what it's like to be me. [♪♪♪] [sighs] All I know is Charlie needs us to work together. It's the difference about doing the right thing or-- or the easy thing. [sighs] She's really good, isn't she? Yeah. She really is. Oh, God. [sighs] Sometimes, man, sometimes I feel like... I really messed up. But I-- I look at her and uh... And I feel like I did pretty good, right? Yeah. You really did. You both did. She's a good girl. Yeah. And um... I'm-- I'm sorry I should have come to you -and I should have like-- -You know what? Man to man... Yeah. [sighs] You've been a good friend to me. You have. Just uh, treat her good, okay? What are we doing here? Something you need to see. CHARLIE: Why is dad here? Go ask him. What's going on? [Charlie chuckles] [Clint chuckles] So, how exactly did you two manage to pull this one off? We took a page out of your playbook. And we made Buchanan an offer he couldn't refuse. So, you threatened him? -What! No. -No. What kind of people you think we are? Bitsy, I mean Beth. Beth. When Troy found out who we were dealing with, he had heard the name before. Not just heard. Turns out this dude's got a really bad reputation for some pretty shady business practices. You know what I mean? Troy says that Buchanan works construction. Likes to cut corners and a lot of other illegal activities. Yup. And I was on the receiving end of a couple of those. Yeah. 'Course he didn't want to sell us Chango at first. But... I told him it would be a damn shame if word got out about how he does business. 'Specially to the State Licensing Board. -That was a good one. -[chuckles] It's weird how loss of income and uh, threat of prison can change a man's heart, you know. Yeah. Started to see the light. Start to see things our way and let us buy the horse. Anyways, he finally decided to sell us the horse. Seriously? How did you two do it? TROY: Well, it's not impossible for us to uh, work together, right? You know this horse came into our lives right when we needed him. It's a God-given thing the way he brought us all closer. Healed us. TROY: Hey, Charlie, I'm really sorry I missed your ride. From now on, I'm keeping my promises. To both of you guys. Speaking of riding, you and your horse are in the finals tomorrow? Well, but he's not my horse anymore. He's yours. Only thing is, we just happen to have him for sale. For the very fine price of $300. But we're only accepting payment in coins. You don't happen to know any prospective buyers, do you? I'll be right back. You've been carrying that around with you? All this time? Well, you know what they say? What's that? Luck is when opportunity meets preparation. I like the sound of that. That's pretty catchy. Deal! Whoa. Hold on a second? You're gonna need this for your feed. But I get a lucky penny. [indistinct chatter in background] And now, cowboys and cowgirls. we are ready for the last event of the day, the Girls Barrel Racing Finals. I'm nervous. You stay here with Mikey. I'm gonna go find Clint and check on Charlie. Yeah. Hey, hey, we got this. We can hold the fort, right, kiddo? Yeah, mom. You can trust us. -I'm hungry. -Yes, I'm hungry, -You wanna get a snack? -We gotta get some food. -Yeah, let's do it. -Yeah. Come on, let's go. Come on. Hope you enjoyed your beginner's luck. Too bad that's all it was. [sighs] You know, Madison, they say people like you are miserable inside, and personally, I'm too happy of a person to play that game. I hope you find a way to be happy. ANNOUNCER: Our next competitor is a name that you've all heard before here at the finals, Madison Farnsworth. [crowd cheering] Time for me to show you how it's done. [♪♪♪] ♪ There wasn't any kind of good life ♪ ♪ No well-wishing words from your bells ♪ ♪ The start of a sunny end ♪ ♪ Now then ♪ ♪ A low breeze ♪ ♪ Is blowing through the South ♪ You nervous, too? I didn't get it; what she has with him. But I love Charlie and I love how Chango brought us all back together. I'm glad you had a change of heart. You have a change of heart about anything else? Like what? I don't know. Maybe. Let me take you out. Like on a date? Yes, a date. Like a real date? Is there any other kind? I don't know, it's just been so long, I wouldn't know what a real date is. Well, we could go to the movies. Dinner. And dress up. Just you and me. Okay. Let's hear it for that great run from Madison Farnsworth. And now, our final rider, it's gonna be Charlie Mitchell and Chango. [♪♪♪] -Yes! Yes, yes, yes! -[Beth shouts] Yes! Come on! Yes! BETH: Charlie! [crowd cheers] CLINT: Yes! Come on!
