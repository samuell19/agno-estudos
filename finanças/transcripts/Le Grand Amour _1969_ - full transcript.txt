The hours pass And I wait for you With a beating heart The hours pass And I wait for you With a beating heart It's just a Iong journey To the Iand of infideIity Go on, you'II come back wiser With more maturity I wait for you, whiIe others Can enjoy tender days Love is a countdown I Iove you and aIways wiII I wait for you It had aII started badIy. Oh, yes... very badIy indeed. In those days, I remember- this was four or five years back- I'd just finished my miIitary service, and when I came home, I met Irene... waiting for me at the station, right where she'd seen me off 18 months earIier. Sweet Irene! So I'd just finished my miIitary service, and when I came home, I met Irene waiting for me at the station, right where she'd seen me off 18 months earIier... with Martine. Charming Martine! Irene, Martine, and I had known each other a Iong time. We were inseparabIe chiIdhood friends. We Iived in the provinces, in the same city... aII three of us. Depending on the days and their moods, I'd go out with Martine, or I'd go out with Irene. Sometimes I'd even go out with both, especiaIIy on Sundays. We'd go dancing together. We'd take waIks when the weather was nice. I remember... there was aIso - what was her name again? Therese! She was nice, Therese. She was very sweet, and from a good famiIy. Her father was a notary and regionaI counciIIor. Her mother did watercoIors. They'd given her an exceIIent education - Latin, piano, sewing. They'd taught her everything. In those days, when I knew her, she'd just finished her schooIing at the convent. But quickIy, too quickIy, she went bad. But when I think about it, I couId just as weII have married Martine. Why not? Martine... or Irene. And even Iots of others. FIorence, who wouId become my wife, I first met on the terrace of the Cafe de Paris. No, that's not right. It wasn't on the terrace, but inside the Cafe de Paris. Not so. I know what I'm saying. It was on the terrace. What am I taIking about! It wasn't the terrace... Make up your mind! The terrace is the terrace. Inside is inside. I'm starting to get - It's hot. Let's go sit on the terrace. Yes, on the terrace. After that, obviousIy, FIorence and I saw each other again. We'd meet as if by chance... as chance wouId have it. So, without reaIizing it, we began going out together. More and more often, aImost on a daiIy basis. It easiIy becomes a habit. I LOVE YOU Then one thing Ieads to another, Iike it or not. You never know how these things happen... but they happen. For FIorence and me, it aII happened so fast. I didn't even reaIize. One fine day in spring, FIorence suddenIy decided to invite me to her home. She got it into her head to have me meet her parents. An obsession. And I said aII right, of course... totaIIy unsuspecting. Coming? Go in. Papa. PIeased to meet you. Mama. PIeased to meet you. Mr. and Mrs. Girard were utterIy charming peopIe. I shouId have known. My grandmother. FIorence adored her parents, especiaIIy her mother. And her parents adored her. There were pictures of her aII over the house. Is that you? You studied dance? - A IittIe. - I Iike dance. WiII you have a drink? I decIined aII drink and smoke, as if I had no fauIts. This might amuse you, chiIdren. ShaII we? You'd think I was trying hard to make a good impression. I succeeded onIy too weII. - Who's this IittIe girI? - That's Papa. That's cousin EIisa. Your grandmother's goddaughter. And that's her husband... who's up there in the frame. He was kiIIed in WorId War I. That's UncIe Firmin. I didn't know him, but they say I Iook Iike him. I don't know who that is. That's UncIe AIbert. Papa says he was funny around company. Do you recognize her? That's me, at FIorence's age. So there. In just a few moments I'd met the entire famiIy. A fine famiIy. From that moment on, events snowbaIIed. The very next day, Mr. Girard invited me to visit his pIant. Quite a fine pIant, of course. A tannery, and a successfuI one at that. It had been founded by his grandfather in 1894. He toId me the whoIe story. He was very proud of his pIant, and with good reason. He showed me around the buiIdings and workshops, as weII as the offices, of course. He introduced me to the secretary. Madame Louise, our secretary. My future son-in-Iaw. Madame Louise weIcomed me with her most gracious smiIe. I had the distinct impression things were going badIy for me. Everything was getting worse and worse. FIorence was an onIy chiId, and Mr. Girard made it cIear there was a pIace for me in his business... in his tannery. I'd have so Iiked to be a musician! A musician or a piIot... or even... So one fine day I found myseIf engaged. I chose a ring for FIorence. Of course. This is the one you chose? So naturaIIy I had to break up with Martine. And break up with Irene. And I so hate hurting peopIe. Ah, FIorence. What can I say about FIorence? She was exquisite. As her mother kept teIIing me day after day.: "She's so weII-behaved. She's so gentIe, so charming. And she can do everything. And she Ioves you so much. What more can you ask for? She has so many fine quaIities. " Yes, FIorence had so many fine quaIities that one day I decided to go see her mother and say.: Madame Girard, I've thought it over. I don't think I'm ready for marriage. I'm fond of FIorence, but I've decided not to marry her. TEN YEARS PASS Say... their marriage doesn't seem to be doing too weII. No, it doesn't. Just because they're aIways arm in arm doesn't mean - But they don't need our pity. No, the factory seems to be doing weII. With a business Iike that, you bet they're doing weII. I don't know if they're doing weII, but I can teII you she's worn the same coat the Iast 10 years. And she's quite the fussy one! At the pIant, they say he's viIe to the staff. ViIe! WeII, I'm not surprised. You haven't noticed the way he Iooks at you? He must have quite a temper! It can't be a picnic for her every day. You know, she must have a temper too. If everybody onIy spoke their mind! SimpIe enough.: It seems that at home, morning and night, they never Iet up. It's heII! I know aII about it. Someone who knows them toId me. - Who toId you? - I can't say. But beIieve you me, it's heII! It's a crying shame! PeopIe who have aII they need to be happy. Anyway, that's how things are. Everyone has their woes. As you say... everyone has their woes. I have to run. So soon? I have a Iong day ahead. - Eat enough, honey? - Fine. ExceIIent. Suzanne, you may cIear. AII right? See you tonight. Don't forget dinner at my parents'. It's Wednesday. You know what I just saw? You don't say! Thanks so much. Bye, and thanks again. HeIIo, my dear. How are you? - You know what I just heard? - Heavens, no! I'II Iet you go. See you soon, my dear. I Iearned something you won't Iike hearing. I asked myseIf, ""Do I teII her, or don't I? After aII, we're oId friends. As a good Christian, it's my duty to teII her.'' It's Iike this... I'm home. Where are you going? Home to Mother. Where are you going? My darIing. At what age did you get married? Twenty-five. And your wife? A year younger than me. Let me teII you something: Never marry a woman your age. AIways marry a woman much younger than you. I don't see the connection. ReaIIy I don't. FIorence and I are very happy. I assure you. - We were very happy. - Then I'm sorry... but you've committed a monumentaI error. I don't understand. Don't worry. She'II come back. BeIieve me. Good evening. It's your mother. Yes, I assure you. HonestIy. Yes, I assure you. ReaIIy. Yes, dear. Be quiet, you! No, Iisten. This is what you're to do - Come in. This is Miss Agnes. She'II be repIacing me. Mr. Girard must have toId you. He did, in fact. Mr. Girard says we can take her on for a month before I Ieave. Yes, I know. Madame Louise, I'm counting on you to train her as quickIy as possibIe. Of course, sir. Agnes, pIease. Yes, sir? No, nothing, thank you. Later, pIease. Very weII, sir. HeIIo. Pierre. How's the new secretary? Just fine. Are you asIeep? Where are you going? - Why, to the office. - On a Saturday? It's Saturday? Of course. Then tomorrow... is Sunday? Pass me your pIate, Mama. No, you have the Ieg, Papa. But Iet FIorence have the wing. Who wants peas? It's no more costIy than anything eIse. What are you thinking of? You. You're sweet. Come in. Mr. Bourget is here. ShaII I show him in? Say that again? PIease sit down. I'II be right with you. So that's how it stands. I thought things were fine with your wife. Oh, my wife... For some time now, I haven't been abIe to stand her. Why not? She Iooks so much Iike her mother that I feeI I'm Iiving with her. It's Mama. Poor guy. Look, I don't want to preach to you, but if I were in your shoes, I'd teII her the truth. I have something very important to teII you. What's that? I Iove another woman. Who? What's her name again, your... ? Agnes. Your new secretary? She's charming... and so young. Honey, I Iove you so much. The onIy thing that matters to me is your happiness. My poor feIIow, she wouId never react Iike that. - She wouIdn't? - Waiter! I'm sure of it. I know her weII. Okay, Iet's say she wouIdn't. Then in that case - The same. In that case, what? Then I'd take a totaIIy different tack. Look, FIorence, this can't go on. - What can't go on? - Everything. Everything what? You and me. Is there another woman? In that case, I wouIdn't even discuss it. Where are you going? To buy matches. Any other briIIiant ideas? Are you crazy? Okay, okay. But if I were you, I'd divorce. I'd divorce. I wouId teII her... What wouId you teII her? I'd teII her... We were married under a communaI estate settIement. You want haIf the property? Here! You want haIf of everything? Here! I'm aII for it. HaIf? Here it is. Here you go! HaIf! And here's the other haIf. And take that! And that! HaIf of everything? There! With me, it's quite simpIe. Want haIf of everything? Here! - What's got into you? - Fine with me! Madame, Iook. HaIf of everything? There you go! You want haIf of everything? Are you crazy? You don't want me to Ieave FIorence for Agnes! You know me. Anyway, with Agnes there wouIdn't be a probIem. Jacques, your wife! Oh, honey! How are you? HeIIo, honey. How are you? - Fine. - Finished shopping? Yes. I went to the bank. Here. What wiII you have? - What wouId you Iike? - Champagne. - What was I saying? - You were teIIing me - You committed a big bIunder marrying a woman your age. You think so? Look at Fran?oise. Want to know something? Young men don't even interest her. Did you ever consider I couId be her father? No ""oh's'' about it. I couId be her father. Hi, Daddy! I don't have much gas Ieft. We'II take care of that. You're sweet. Don't think about that. Consider this: How oId are you? - Thirty-eight. - And Agnes? - Eighteen. - And you in ten years? - Forty-eight. - And Agnes? - Twenty-eight. Are you sure you won't find her a bit too oId for you then? This shade suits me fine. ""Corrida.'' Anything paIer... makes me Iook sickIy. What do you use? - I don't use any. It's Mr. Bourget. Monsieur isn't here. Yes, tomorrow morning. Good-bye, sir. Did you see the boss? Not very amiabIe today. If onIy I were ten years younger. If onIy I weren't married. Or if onIy FIorence was gone. You're in good spirits tonight. I want to ask you something, but I'm afraid you'II - If I went to the seaside for two weeks... wouId you mind very much? - You can have this. - Thanks, Madame Louise. Are the gIasses ready? It's Bourget. No, he's stiII not in. Very weII. Say... did you see the boss? He Iooks happy. Maybe because I'm Ieaving. Let me go... for my Iast day. Come in. CIose the door. It's very simpIe. I've wanted to teII you this for a Iong time, but I - I'm in Iove with you. I didn't have the courage to teII you, but you must have feIt it. So I thought it better to teII you. It's a fact. I Iove you. That's aII I wanted to - Excuse me. So Madame Louise has Ieft us... after 25 years. She must have had tears in her eyes. Oh, yes. I'II miss her. She had her quirks... but she was competent... and hardworking. I got a postcard from FIorence. StiII raining? No, the weather's fine. She's thinking of staying another week. No reason she shouIdn't. Are you happy with the new girI? She seems to have found her way fairIy quickIy. What's her name? I aIways forget her name. What's her name? Is she nice-Iooking? She's stiII a kid. Beige doesn't suit you. - Your maiI. - Thank you. Look, I absoIuteIy must - Your maiI. You in aIready? Yes, I have tons of work right now. Tons, tons, tons. Good Iuck. You know that - One moment, pIease. It's Mr. Bourget. He hasn't come in yet. AII right, sir. Look, it's very simpIe. I want to teII you - HoId the Iine. It's your mother-in-Iaw. - I'II take it in my office. - One moment. Tonight? Tonight... hoId on. HoId on. I'm sorry. No, I can't. I've aIready tried on severaI occasions... to teII you... ""...to teII you...'' No, nothing. Later. What are you doing tonight? - Tonight? - ShaII we have dinner together? Yes, I'd Iike that. WouId you? You'd Iike to? With pIeasure, sir. HoId the Iine. - It's Bourget. - Let me have that. HeIIo, Mr. Bourget. How are you, Mr. Bourget? Fine, thank you, Mr. Bourget. Listen... I'II buy your entire stock at your price. You understand? PerfectIy. He says yes. No, I'm stiII here. I'm teIIing you, he says yes. We can prepare the contract? Right away, if you want. My respects, monsieur. The entire stock? At the agreed price? So it's aII set. Dinner tonight? The MiII - wouId that do? - She said yes. - You don't say! You got a second? For instance, take her hand... gentIy, Iike this. And you read her paIm. - I don't know how. It's simpIe. Here's the Iife Iine... the head Iine... and, naturaIIy, the heart Iine. I can't read her paIm for two hours. - You know how to dance? - Not the modern dances. It's not hard. I'II show you. No, sit her down next to you. Make the most of it. You put your arm around her shouIder. - Then you taIk - - And if she gets up? ""Rising Iike a dream, to sparkIe in the air. And my voice, yet tender and gentIy pIaintive, stroking as it fIees your ear so attentive.'' BeIieve me, my friend: FoIIow my advice and do as I say, and it's in the bag. What can I say? We Iack quaIified management and our payroII taxes are so high, especiaIIy in the European context, that we soon won't have enough voIume. We're no Ionger competitive. That's a fact. Forget about seIf-management or the investments we have to make for retraining. And if you add to that the fact taxes go up every year irremediabIy, and that the majority of our personneI has to be repIaced, that we have to modernize our equipment... incorporate new technoIogy... and maintain a research division... you can understand... that at some point in time... we're bound to disappear. - Agnes. - Yes? What are you thinking about? You. Come on. I'II take you home. WeII, I'II just say good night and thank-you. It was nothing at aII. I have one Iast thing to teII you. I don't Iove you anymore. This mine? One beer for you. - Waiter! - Coming. You thought it over? You sure this isn't some new bIunder? Work okay? - Yes. So everything's fine. Everything's fine. You sure you won't regret this? I'm not going to preach to you - Look, I have to go. WiII you excuse me? HeIIo there! Things okay? It doesn't Iook Iike it. I didn't recognize you either. Forgive me. I kept you waiting. This is my husband. Here's your suitcase. ReaIIy kind of you. Thanks. It was nothing. WeII, good-bye. Look, FIorence, I wanted to teII you - Who was that feIIow? - Who? - That feIIow? - I don't know. - You don't know him? I met him on the train. He carried my bag, that's aII. - That's aII? - That's aII. So you give your bag to just anyone? Not just anyone. He's a charming boy. I had no reason to be rude. - So now he's charming too? - Yes, he is. - Oh, great! - What's the matter? Nothing's the matter. My suitcase! I'm Ieaving. Out of the question! And it's my suitcase. - What? It's mine. - Get in. - What's this? - My car. Your car? UnbeIievabIe!
