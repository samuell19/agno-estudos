Jean-Baptiste, come and see! I found a car over there. The engine was running, the lights on... It's strange. Come and see. - What is it? - It's on your land. - Is he dead? - Almost. - What happened? - Clear the table. Who is it? Give me the cushion, quick. What happened to him? Come on. Get some water and a funnel. Come on. Wake up, buddy! Open his jaws. Come on. No sleeping! Lift him up. Hold his head from behind. Here, take a towel. Swallow! Come on. Swallow! There. The funnel. - Lift his head up. - Here, can you help me? Come on. Hurry up, Antoine. The water. Yes, the bucket on that side. That's good. What's for lunch? - Oh no. - Jean-Baptiste. There! Let's do it again. Funnel. Are you alright? - I guess... - Yes? We'll put him back in the greenroom after. Let me know if anything happens at all. And keep checking his pulse. You know, in hospital, after the suicide attempt, he'd be put on the system, identified. It'll be hard enough for him already when he wakes up here. The only problem is knowing if we pumped him in time. We really have to monitor him in the next few hours. But that can be done just as well here as in hospital. But what if he dies on us? No, no... He will make it. If that were to happen, he'd get his wish anyway. Really? Go down and have something to eat. We mustn't leave too late. He must have been very unhappy to reach this point. Not necessarily, my dear Marguerite. Above all, he wasn't able to take a good look at his situation. Whereas you are, without even having spoken to him? That's right. Absolutely. He acted in the heat of the moment. In a state of shock... Probably chronic shock. Most so-called depression is usually due to past traumas that resurface from puberty or early childhood... or even before. - What do you mean, "before"? - Yes. Even birth is a shock... that most people never manage to get over. I dread to think the shock he'll get on waking up. Alright. Now that the organ issue is resolved, he can manage on his own. Why are you whispering? Are you scared of waking him? - We've done the easy bit. - What would you know? - Well... - We know nothing about this guy. He gave in to a breakdown and that is stupid. Life is beautiful. Unhappiness shows us that. Cheers, eh? You will never change. Do you think he'd agree? - Who? - The guy upstairs. Well, why not? You brought him back to life, but that doesn't mean he wants to live. Shall we bet? Bet on what? He had a reason to kill himself. I'll find him two reasons to live. That's nine too many. So we're agreed? In two weeks' time, if he's the happiest man alive, you win. That's right. - If he tries to kill himself again... - You win. I win what? - Well, six cases of Médoc. - Yes. - Which one? - Mouton Rothschild. - Forty-three? - Yes, Marguerite knows. - Alright. - You two disgust me! Don't worry, Marguerite, he will drink it with us. Is this François Winter's house? Yes, I know that. He's here, at my place. No, that is not the question. Never mind who I am. There you go, Mrs. Winter, rest assured. He's in good hands. And forget about what he wrote. In 15 days, he'll be with you on top form. Really? Great. I understand. I'm not taking care of his private life but rather his life itself. Ah, very well, yes. Hello? Hello? I'd like to speak to the editor-in-chief. It's regarding an important message about an employee, François Winter. Put me through to someone else if not. Alpo! Ossette! Hi, Pierre. How are you? A couple of things, Pierre. There's someone in the greenroom. I've been thinking about that. We will cut it down. It overshadows that one. Yeah, there's a ladder. - Have a good day, buddy. - Thanks. I will do her in 20 minutes. DOCTOR MORIN Good morning, my dear. Good morning. Are many waiting? Only the three Grâces for a check-up, Mr. Dupont, and Mrs. Leclerc, but they can wait, can't they? No, open up first. - Huh? - Alright... How's your fiancé? Exhausted. He had an exhausting weekend. Good morning! Who's next? - It's for you, Doctor. - Ah! Mrs. Leclerc, have a seat. Yes? Hello, sir? It's Pierre speaking. He's just waking up. No, not a word. Yes, understood. Yes, the dogs have had it. Yes, I will give him. Yes, goodbye, sir. Good morning, sir. Are you alright? Maybe you'd like something to eat? Where am I? What? Who are you? I work for the doctor. Which doctor? Dr. Morin. Which Dr. Morin? You don't know Dr. Morin? So, you don't want anything to eat? What are you doing? How are you, Mr. Winter? Who are you? Dr. Morin. Calm down. You have no reason to be afraid. - How do you know my name? - That was easy. From your driving license and your press card. Oh, here you go! Here, put that on for me. You searched my pockets? I did something worse. I went through your stomach. What has that got to do with you? Elementary, dear Winter. I'm a doctor. Then I found you on my hunting ground. I decide between life and death there. Whiskey or gin? Some cold water. Oh dear! Oh! If you'd like to empty your pockets, I'll take that for cleaning. What a request! What do you want from me? Do you have any idea? You can enjoy the house. Luckily, you'll find clothes that fit you. The kitchen has everything you need. - Do you like to cook? - I'm not interested in that. It will. There's wine in the cellar, spirits in the bar. So... So, if you need anything... all you have to do is ask. Or tell Pierre, the old guy that looks after the dogs. You can also call my office and I'll bring you what you need. I come here every evening. I would point out that I had a plan and you messed it up. I'm wondering how you can think that I'll just sit here quietly. I called your wife and informed the paper, so there's no... Goddammit! Why are you getting involved? Listen, Winter. Nobody knows where you are. You can be dead if you want, but... comfortably dead. So it'd be a mistake not to enjoy it. Please, have a seat. Did my wife tell you about a note? Yes, indeed. That's all she said? She implied that you haven't been living together for some time? Who did you talk to at the paper? A minion who promised to pass on the message to the boss. Did you warn him too? Do you know you've got me in deep trouble? What do I look like? A walking corpse to whom you offer some Bordeaux. Ridiculous! - I'm sorry. - Not yet! You'll be sorry one day! Is the music bothering you? You're not interested in music? What else do you want to know? What do you think of this pâté? Rather fatty. No, no. Leave it. There's something else. Wild boar cutlets. Delightful. May I? Some potatoes. Not bad, eh? I'm in no way grateful for what you are doing. Your help, your reassurance... your silk robe, your cutlets. I don't give a damn about all that! You give it without asking if I like it! Exactly. Supposing I don't? I wouldn't say so. I think it stinks here! It stinks of elegance, class, the crystal, silverware! A cesspit with Gobelin tapestries. I wake up in it! You're free to go. Oh, you think so? Yes. You can leave. You are free. No. Not anymore. You're responsible for my life. We are connected. That's true. And you will pay for it all. Until the end. Until the end of what? Guess. That's fascinating. Not bad, though. - How's it going? - Fine. - Today, we could... - What? We're not hanging around. - We're taking care of him. - I've got the chainsaw. - Have a good day. - Thanks. MORIN PRODUCTS That tree is beautiful. It's stupid to cut it down. The doctor says it creates too much shade. You're cutting it now? No. I haven't got a ladder. Have you been working for the doctor long? I've always known him. How is he linked to Morin Products? That was his father. Really? You're not from around here? No, no. From Paris? Yes, I lived in Paris for a long time. Will you be staying here long? It's hard to say. See you later, then. You're crazy! The doctor was very fond of this tree! Even better! I'd like to speak to Dr. Morin urgently. Hello? It's Winter. The tree has fallen on Pierre and I can't move it. - Dammit! Why did you cut it down? - It wasn't me! - What? - No! I think that guy is crazy. Really? Yes, I understand. Hell no, François! Cornflakes will spoil your appetite. The house is full of good stuff. That's no good. For the fishermen, oil tankers that empty out offshore are gangsters. The factories that dump their waste along the coast are criminals. How are you? Did you have a good day? Yes, not bad. The main thing is you found something to do. If you think of any more tricks, go ahead. I never fail. What's it like being a capitalist posing as a rural doctor? The pros of one compensate for the cons of the other. The unpleasant bits of my job also have their charm. It's a question of habit. So, basically, you're happy. Yes, you said it. I'm happy. Like you, for that matter. You're not a proletarian as far as I know. As a journalist, you are privileged. I was. How! You can't dwell on the past alone. I didn't say I wanted to live. Let's have a drink. Close the cupboard. - What were you watching? - I don't know. Do you mind if I light a fire? No, sorry, I should have done it. Life is not the worst thing. Those with warm feet can say that but a guy who's lost his family, whose wife has kicked him out? A failed marriage doesn't have to be a catastrophe. I've got a happy divorce behind me. On both sides. My life is pick-and-mix now. And if he finds out his children aren't his? I hate children. They can't be counted on. It could be a disaster for him. He could become impotent. Impotent? No one is impotent. You think you are, then you become it. Don't worry. It'll come back. Why do you think I was talking about me? Despite all that bad luck, that man might find some satisfaction in his work. On the line, at the factory? Unless he's a journalist. Journalists are parasites of events. If nothing happens, they don't exist. Things always happen. They make you believe that. I've actually heard that some journalists live for an ideal. We never have an ideal. We think we do and that's... What were you just saying? And that's why we become impotent. But you won't take care of my sex life. Oh, God forbid! Did you manage to wash his clothes? - Is it alright? - Thank you, Sylvie. How is he? He's intelligent. Very seductive but at the same time, he is trapped. It's worrying. He's alone in the world. He will need someone to take care of him. He is heartbroken, so you can imagine... Poor guy. Would you mind taking him his clothes? I'm sure he'd be pleased. What about you? Why do you say that? No reason. If he's as attractive as you say, aren't you scared? - You'd like to be scared, eh? - Yes. Why don't you get the chainsaw? It's broken. That machine is fragile. Damn. Good morning, Pierre! Do you know where Mr. Winter is? He just went back inside. Mr. Winter? Mr. Winter? Are you Mr. Winter? Here are your things. I have washed them. Who are you? Sylvie Gilbert. A friend of Dr. Morin. I don't know him. Dr. Morin? This is his house. Ah! His name is Morin? Why did he send you with this? Probably to be of service to you. I didn't ask for anything. You're not well? Don't worry, I'm fine. I won't die here before your eyes. Anyway, now you have some clean clothes. Where do I hang them? In the greenroom. You don't need to make my bed. How do you know Dr. Morin? I already told you. We are friends. Does he screw you? Are you the happy divorce? I've never been married to Jean-Baptiste. His wife was called Marguerite. What's with all the questions? Because you're too pretty for him. Why are you unkind to him? He saved my life. Ah, of course. You'd better leave now. So then, Friday? At 9 a.m.? Is it color? Alright, good. Which channel? Whose show is it? Of course we will watch it! You think! Yes, yes! He's fine. He's more and more feisty. It's a good sign. You were right, you know. He had valid reasons. You're kidding, right? A bet is a bet. You can order the Médoc now. You'll drink half of it, you scoundrel! There you go. Say hello to Marguerite for me. Actually, no. Give her a kiss. Bye. Hello, Pierre. Hello, sir. Are you leaving, sir? I'm just going for a walk in the forest. I need some air. - Enjoy your walk, then. - I will, thanks. - You were here? - The doctor told me to watch you. You have a good aim. Wild boars can be bad. That's a solitary one. But the worst of all is one that is injured. It will keep on charging. You see, sir. We don't want to get in its way. No worries. He had to sleep. Sylvie! Bad luck. I already had it! So, eh... The light is not working! It's the fuses! There are candles and matches on the fireplace. Go on, my dear! I'm happy with this car. Either he's in the forgotten land or he must sleep like a baby. We'll cook him up a meal to remember. Oh, I can't believe it! He hanged himself! Oh, shit! I'm sorry. I didn't know you had guests. It's my fault. I should have told you. Come, on girls. It's just a prank. Mr. Winter! Mrs. Gilbert! - Who might you be? - Miss Jacqueline Douvin. - Charmed. - Charmed. Mr. Winter, an expert practical joker. Where did this animal come from? Well, I was forced to shoot it because it attacked old Pierre. Well, old chap, I'm done there. Well... Come on. Help me. An impeccable stomach pump! We were ten kilometers from the house. Renan arrived... Everything is fine? Let's move to the living room. We'll have some champagne. Jacqueline, will you help me? - Alright. - Let's clear up. We'll put this in the kitchen. I don't know what I should have been... Something else would have been better. Why are you so bitter? - I'm bitter? - Yes. Sorry. It's not because of you. You really scared me. You did yesterday as well. It was really beneath you. Nor yesterday, I didn't mean you any harm. - Yes, it's true. - That's unbelievable. Bring a candleholder. - Everything alright? - Shall we dance? With these boots? Darling, you only have to remove them. No! No! - Yes! - Do it. It's not difficult! Let me do it, then! You're not dancing, François? Let yourself go for once. Come on, then, sweetheart. Let's dance! - Come on. - Come on, François! Tell me you love me, Jean-Baptiste! What if I were gay? Huh? I told you, girls, François is a prankster. I'm tired. I'm going home. No, out of the question! We still have the lobster. Jacqueline, come with me. Are you gay? I am nothing. I am dead. Dead tired. You're very beautiful. Didn't I say that would work out. Let's eat in my room. Initially, I felt a bit sorry for Jean-Baptiste. He faked being happy after his divorce. I was the only one who knew the truth. But Marguerite doesn't realize. Marguerite is his ex-wife. I knew her well before their marriage. He even still invites her with Antoine. It's masochism. Instead of facing things head-on, a chapter closed, a page turned. I'm scared. I know that if one day I'll tell him that I'm leaving, he'll say, "Do you have enough money?" Deep down, it's what I must do. Leave. Maybe you think I'm not brave enough? You're on the right path. Bye, Mrs. Amont. Good health. Well, then. Goodbye. Oh, what a surprise! To what do I owe the honor? I was afraid of missing you. You were with Sylvie. Don't count on it! I will never leave you. Your patients seem to love you. That's the kind of popularity we buy by not making people pay. You can afford it. Exactly. I never said otherwise. Is that the only reason? No, maybe not. In a town like that, everyone knows each other. I played with some of them as a kid in the holidays. I delivered the young ones, I've helped the elderly to die, and the whole town knows. People love living in this area. They are numb. It's better to be numb and alive. From a medical point of view, you can't be alert and dead. Aha! Now that is true! After three years, not an atom in our bodies was the same, and after five years, everything had been renewed. He wasn't bad back then, but... he is a bit out of shape. He has become oafish. ...who was sitting here. Well, yes, it's kind of true. ...you are such a stranger to me. I must say, he's one of my best friends. I like him a lot in private. I've never met him. Really? Well, he should be coming next weekend. He's actually married to my ex-wife. Marguerite? From the happy divorce? How do you know her name? Is it worth talking about? - I gave it to my lawyer. - And the verdict? I haven't read it. I'm not planning to remarry. How did you arrange a happy divorce? It was very simple. With space and self-control. Rather unusual. And essential for both. And what was written in those papers? That I was too old? It's the truth. You are brave to keep watching this. I have to if he's coming tomorrow. Anyway, I'm going to bed. I know the end. Really? Sylvie. Sylvie? What does that mean? My dear Sylvie, what is it? Huh? Come on over here. Get warm. Have a drink. It will pick you up. Come on. Take your coat off. No, I don't want to. Good night. No, François, stay. I know her. She hasn't come because of me. What will you drink, Sylvie? I don't want anything. Thank you, François. I'll get some ice. What's wrong, Sylvie? I'm very happy that you're here. I can't stop shaking. Don't stop. If you stop yourself, it's over. Why do you stay here? Hunting is starting to interest me. So, dear Sylvie, are you feeling better? You look better now. You really don't want a drink? - Don't touch me. - What are you saying? I said don't touch me! I despise you! - You son of a bitch! - What have I done? You have used me for four years! Like Jacqueline, like François, everyone! Why do you say that? I care about you, Sylvie. You care about me... You care about everyone! I don't know what I could have done. Didn't you use Jacqueline and I yesterday evening? You seemed to like it. He's adorable, isn't he? It's unbelievable that his wife left him. Stop talking nonsense. You said that hunting is starting to interest you. Yes, in a sense. Has Dr. Morin shown you his collection of weapons? That, Sylvie. She's anxious. Yes! Ignore her. She's like that often. I do everything I can for her. - Where are my car keys? - I left them in my office. If you had said this morning... You will have them tomorrow. Are you really interested in hunting? Yes, really. You're starting to smell bad. You should change your clothes. - Ready? - Fire! Focus, François. Seriously. Are you there? - Yes. - Ready? Fire! How are you, Pierre? You seem happy. Always happy to see you, madam. Oh, Pierre, you are charming! Why have you cut down my tree? You'd better ask the doctor. What do you mean by that? Hello, Pierre. How are you? There's no point looking for him. You knew that that was my tree. You only have to take it with you, dear! - You knew I loved it. - That's why it was cut down. - Hello, buddy. How is he? - I'm fine. Is he alright? François Winter, Mrs. Gansinger, Mr. Gansinger. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you feeling better, Mr. Winter? - Yes. Why do you ask? I must tell you, Marguerite and Antoine were here last weekend. Really! So we're among friends. Come on. Let's get to work. Ready? That's better! I saw you on TV last night. - Really? - Yes. Oh, that's nice. What did you think? Fantastic. Really. I was just saying to your friend Jean-Baptiste that... I've never seen you so good. He didn't say a word after the show... I don't know how long for. Right? Sorry, I wasn't listening. I was just saying that you were... silent and shaken after the show. Yes, I only had one word, "Brilliant." Exactly, yes. I think that this role reaffirmed you as the best actor of your generation this side of the Pyrenees. It doesn't matter what the critics say. Friends are the ones that speak the truth. In a business as complex as a tv shoot, actors go from one compromise to the next. In the end, talent is measured by the ability to make the best compromises. Just like in life, buddy. No. In life, the size of an individual is recognized by their refusal of all compromise. You never make any? My life is a gigantic compromise right now. Meaning? Instead of being out of it as planned, I'm here now, allowing myself to be corrupted by the respectable doctor, by his delicious wines, his seductive wines, his charming friend, and his fascinating ex-wife. Don't you think, deep down, that it's rather nice here? The only thing you can complain about here is the gun mania. Oh, the exchange of fire! I love to hunt. I hate animals being killed. You had three helpings of wild boar. Compromise! I eat them, but I don't kill them! But you come hunting with us, Antoine. That's to keep an eye on you, sweetheart. If I understand correctly, you are true to your compromises. Speaking of which, the beat is next weekend. I hope all three of you will come. You started to take an interest, right? I'm interested in the environment. Especially the act of shooting. It's extraordinary, the feeling of physical power at long range. You focus on a target, far away, and that decision has disproportionate consequences. When you shoot, for a fraction of a second, you feel your thoughts... leaving with the bullet. Propelled down the grooves, out the muzzle of the barrel until they reach their target. Beyond our limited self. Freedom. Nothing more nothing less. What about the environment? It's almost irresistibly beautiful and... absolutely awful. Are you being serious? You seem quite intelligent. Of course. You need two intelligent people for a happy divorce like yours. The three of you are happy with it, by all accounts. I think I've won the bet, Jean-Baptiste. What bet? A bet on the intellectual capability and insight of my friend Antoine. You really seem better, François. It's rather time-limited, Marguerite. From the moment your ex-husband started taking care of me to the end of my plans, I'm gliding blissfully. - I'm still in the air. - What are your plans? What if it was you, Marguerite? François, you really talk nonsense. I think it's starting to get cold here. Marguerite. Why are you going in the greenroom? - Your bottle of water. - Thank you, Marguerite. - Good night. - Good night. Good night, Jean-Baptiste. Is anyone there? - Careful. - Come on! No comment on their appetite. They'll have even more by the time of the beat. How come? I use rations to keep them on form. Speaking of form, I have some good news for you. I'm not impotent anymore. Oh? Sylvie? Sylvie? Why Sylvie? No, I don't know. I thought... You think you know everything, but... there are many things that escape you. And nothing ever happened between Sylvie and I. This is just between us. There's no reason to hurt Antoine. You're lying. Wanna bet? That night, I controlled everything that happened in my house. Have you got my keys now? In the right pocket of your jacket. So you can leave whenever you want. I have less and less desire to leave. Jean-Baptiste! Jean-Baptiste! Hurry, it's Pierre! He's out cold at Saint-André. He's blue. Oh, man! - Back out. - Yes. Marguerite has the keys! Marguerite! Let's take mine, then! Hurry! Open it. What's wrong with it, for God's sake? It's been eight days. Cardiac arrest. Open my case, François. Give me the stethoscope. Put it on my ears. Okay, come closer. Put your hands on top of mine. Use the same rhythm as me. That's it. Like that... Yes, like that... Careful. There... Careful. Harder. As if to break through his chest. There... Okay. Pull up his sweater, François. Here, Antoine. It's gone again. You just need to keep pushing until it comes back. That's good, Pierre. I'm sure he will pull through. He is strong. That won't necessarily help him. I'll have to postpone the beat. - You think so? - You have to prepare a beat and Pierre was used to it. We could do quite a bit ourselves. You have to get back to Paris. We should be able to stay. Antoine, the rehearsal is Tuesday the 8th? I have your text. So there's no problem. Really? That's great. First, we need to find some beaters. We need to go to Boutigny to find the guy that helped Pierre. I could take François? Right, Antoine? I'd love to show him Boutigny. I adore that village. Unless you're scared to go out alone with me, Marguerite. Scared? That's a funny idea! If I could make Antoine jealous for once. Don't force yourself too much. François wouldn't do that to my guest. Would you, François? No... Not to any of your guests. - Good morning, Mr. Mori. - Young lady. - How are you? - Very well, and you? Dr. Morin wants you to call him. - Yes. - It's about the beat. I'll do what has to be done. Very well. - How's the bowling? - Good, thanks. - See you soon. - You too. So, are you aware of male chauvinism, my dear François? No. Have I done something to bother you? The other night, you said I was quite intelligent. I wasn't wrong. Who knows? Careful. If you take that off, the spring there, it could go off. That's the tip of the firing pin, made of tempered steel. That's what strikes the primer. - Do you follow? - Hm, hm. That makes the gunpowder explode. Have you understood, François? What an honor to read your diary, Marguerite. - It's not a diary, I'm writing to my mom. - Really? Give her a kiss from me. You wouldn't say it if you knew her. Why? Our mother-in-law is very kind. She's amazing, but her greatest merit is living in Quebec and being terrified of sailing and flying. Mother-in-law! I took a plane once, I was up front, in the days when we ate with trays on our laps. So, we were eating, and all of a sudden, without warning, the plane falls into an air pocket! So you could feel the seat and the ground below disappearing! And... we ended up with the trays over our heads, trying to keep balance. At that moment, I turned around and I saw 92 people, like this, holding the trays above their heads, trying to keep their balance. And then, suddenly, all 92 of them fell back into their seats with their trays on their laps. The sauce was divine. The cabin was full of it. It was great! You seem to be on form today. That is part of my plans. Go to my room. You'll find an oil can in the cupboard. My pleasure. Congratulations, Jean-Baptiste. There's one sick man you've got back on his feet at least. I don't know what I did to him, but he's better. I will order six cases of Médoc tomorrow. No, no. Don't bother. But you said it yourself! A bet is a bet. - Hello, my dear. - Hello, my darling. - How many of them are there? - Five. Well, I'm going to pop to the pharmacy. Have a seat. So, Mrs. Gilbert, how can I help you? I'm sorry about the other night. It was nothing, my love. I'm actually glad you came. I hope you don't think badly of me. Jean-Baptiste, I love you. I also love you very much, you know. Anyway... I'd like us to carry on seeing each other. I think it's better we don't. And why is that? I can't take it anymore. You're still waiting for Marguerite to come back to you. Exactly. I'm sure she will. You're dreaming. I have good reasons to believe it. I'm leaving. When? As soon as possible. Do you have money? Good luck, Sylvie. You'd better go out the back door. What shall I do with the car? Keep it. Next. "Friends, Romans, compatriots, lend me your ears." I... "I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him." Um... "...but Brutus said he was ambitious and Brutus is an honorable man." "...and Brutus is an honorable man." Um... "You all saw at Lupercalia, I presented him the crown three times..." Bravo! Right in the middle. The trick is having wild boars that stay put when we shoot. Go on. Hello. - How are you? - How are you, sir? Let's put it in the cellar. What is it? The big prize is here. Who shall we let win? Antoine or Jean-Baptiste? You know about that? Yes. I was against it from the start. - That's Jean-Baptiste the aviator. - Oh! Dashing, isn't he? Irresistible! I love that photo. That's Jean-Baptiste and I in San Francisco. That was actually our last trip together. Why did you separate? Because I fell in love with Antoine. I think... At least he only plays on the stage. That's a very daring photo. It was the smallest bikini in Saint-Tropez, in '65. Who operated on your appendix? Jean-Baptiste. That's actually how we met. You look very beautiful. Don't you have a photo of you as a girl? Yes, at the beginning. Marguerite! We didn't hear you come in. Where is Antoine? I think he's asleep. I don't like you showing our photos. Nobody is interested. I didn't think it would bother you. Any news on Pierre? Oh, he's not looking good. His brain was affected. He is paralyzed down the right side. - Maybe it wasn't worth it. - Jean-Baptiste! "...and the men have lost their minds. I'm sorry, my heart is in the coffin." "There, with Caesar, and I must halt until it comes back to me." Jean-Baptiste, did you see what came for you? No. I'm coming. Come and see my cellar. You will see. There. Who said it was for me? It's blinding obvious to any idiot. Really? So what's blindingly obvious to you? Don't you see that you've made François... cheerful and lively? You think I did that? Oh, it doesn't matter. Everything happened as you said. You haven't realized that he has fallen in love. Yes, of course. Do you know who he has fallen for? Marguerite, of course. Everyone falls in love with Marguerite. What does she think about it? She's delighted. If you'd like to have a seat... while I do what I have to do. When are you planning to leave? To go where? You won't stay with Jean-Baptiste forever. I will miss you. Very much. We still have a few days left together. I'm very happy about it. You've thrown all my plans up in the air. Me? But I don't know what they are. Anyway, it was fate that you... What day is it? Friday. What bad luck to have run into you! But don't you understand why I've been stuck to you since you arrived? Why I gave you some kind of stupid bourgeois spiel, snooping through your albums? To bring Jean-Baptiste to his knees! Jean-Baptiste? Yes, Jean-Baptiste! The jealousy is killing him. It worked! But what is going on right now? Idiot... A prize idiot... I let myself be had. I fall in love. Yes, there you go! What will become of me now? I'm already a corpse, a walking nothing. I only look alive. I've nothing to give. That's not true. When I tell myself that you are here, that you exist, that I can touch you... Sorry. Five more minutes and it'll be done. So that's how it is, that's all. You're really upsetting me. No, Marguerite. What are you doing? Waiting for the rain to ease off. Alright, very well, but... Why did you go out? We had the car's oil changed and got petrol for the 4L. I thought you had broken down. - No! - See you tonight. See you tonight! Have a nice day! Boris, you can leave, and you kids, I'll meet you there. I will give you your exact positions. - Don't be late. - No, go ahead. You're shaking, François? I'm fine. And you? I'm fine. I entrust this rifle to you. With this, you'll have no problem. - Very well. - Careful. I'll get it first shot. First hunt. Come on. This way. François, stand here. François, look! You forgot to load it. Well played, Jean-Baptiste! You've injured it! Careful, it's coming back! Oh, man! Run, François, run! Run, François! Run! François! It's over. François... François... I love you, you know... You'll get better, you'll see. You'll see. It's nothing, you know... You'll get better. I love you. I love you. I love you. You'll see... You'll be fine. Yes, you'll be fine. You'll be fine after. You have a lot to give me, you know... François... I love you. I love you, you know... You'll get better. We'll be fine. Why didn't his rifle work? - He just stood there. - I love you. - He didn't run. - François... Why didn't his rifle work? I removed the firing pin. I wanted to play a trick on him. Yes... Yes... I promise. François... François... It's good. Very good. Was it expensive? Very expensive. I'll pay you back. Let's not talk about it anymore. Subtitle translation by: Natasha da Silva
