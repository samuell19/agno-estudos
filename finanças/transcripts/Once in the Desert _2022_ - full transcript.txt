Russian Center for Reconciliation of the Warring Sides sent its best deminers. Demining in the specified area. By this time, the city has effectively been reduced to rubble. …Between 20 and 40 unexploded mines and traps… Base, Raven here, I'm in the waiting zone. ﻿Approaching the line of sight, to the agreed place of exchange. Let's go. Here we go. Observing objects. Information received, observing. ONCE UPON A DESERT THREE MONTHS EARLIER MILITARY BASE OF THE SYRIAN ARAB ARMY We never forget… Death is always around. When carrying out a task, how do you hold the automatic? ﻿Three fingers under the magazine. ﻿The big one on the safety. Understood? Even if you have three fingers. After finding the wires, think first! Stop! You're dead. You're gone. Barmaley (militants; villain from Dr. Aybolit fairy tale)'s tilt sensor is handmade. In this case, it's a syringe, introductory contacts, and a metal ball. - ﻿Tilt and what happens? - Boom! And another electronic device is a gyroscope. ﻿It's triggered by movement. ﻿Stay awake. ﻿If you see an explosive device with a gyroscope, you can't touch it. ﻿Once everyone is in cover, we hang the explosive object with an anchor. I move it. - And what happens? -Boom! Boom. - Comrade Captain. - Comrade Captain what? Did you see that? This is also a geolocation device. Comrade Captain, it's the last day, you could say it's a holiday! ﻿Pass your exam first, then it's a holiday. Comrade Captain, tomorrow it's gonna be me or him that gets torn to pieces. Can you read? ﻿What does it say? "No geolocation devices allowed." Any questions? What are you thinking? ﻿You have a combat mission today. ﻿Come on, let's go get ready to leave. I said run! Did you send the drone? ﻿What's the situation? Syrian Army vehicles have been observed moving toward Palmyra. All right, copy, stand down. Equip yourselves! ﻿Riyadh! ﻿Come with me. ﻿Turn on the jammer. He says, that's why the connection is down! We will work here at your place. Can you close off the road? This minefield is cursed. ﻿- A lot of sappers died here. - I see. ﻿What are the civilians doing here? They're from Palmyra, locals, he knows them. I see. ﻿[With an accent] Hello. Line up! On this field… ﻿…three Iranian sappers were killed. ﻿So come on, guys. Gather round. ﻿Those who pass the exam… ﻿…get a diploma. ﻿The diploma of a sapper. ﻿All right, come on, let's get the cameras rolling. Stop searching! ﻿Muslim's working, the rest go back to the starting point! Run, run, run! Look for the wires! Don't forget the false circuit! ﻿Look for the circuit! ﻿-Red or blue? -Don't look at the color! Look for the wire! Check the whole circuit! Go away, go away! He's on his own! Work!

Real sappers! - Real sappers! - Diplomas will be given out in the unit. ﻿- Riyadh, give me your phone. - What phone? ﻿-Give it to me, I won't take it away. You're on your own now. ﻿- Do you have a password? - No password. ﻿- Disable the jammer. - Yeah. ﻿-The subscriber's phone is switched off or out of network coverage. He's teaching us everything. ﻿Fast. ﻿Okay, what's all the bazaar going on here? ﻿- Why are there outsiders? - They saw us working. ﻿They say we're heroes. ﻿I said you taught us everything. Take a bite. ﻿- Do you speak Russian? - Yes. ﻿- Russian mother, Syrian father. - Just like mine. ﻿- The usual story. - My name is Jamila. Dima. ﻿What are we standing around for? ﻿Let's pack up! - Here. - Can I talk to you for a minute? ﻿-Russian? -Russian. ﻿I noticed you were on the phone. ﻿I don't have a connection. ﻿- And I'm really looking forward to the call. - We put jammers on when we're working. ﻿It's off now. Check it out. - Is there a connection? - There is! ﻿Are you going that way too? Yes. ﻿That way. ﻿Without us, it's gone… ﻿…a miracle in the desert. I worked as a guide before the war. ﻿- So you know everything there? - Yes. The theater? ﻿We'll be working there. If anything, come to you for a consultation. In the theater, 25 children became executioners. ﻿Twenty-five prisoners of the Islamic State were executed. Yes, I watched the video. We can't leave everything here like this. Dima will kill us for this! Let's go! Don't worry, there are some of our own here. Let's go take pictures! I'll continue our conversation. Did you call your wife? ﻿- Daughter. - Daughter. Her name is Tatiana. Wedding's coming up. Did you prepare a gift? A rich fiancé. ﻿Nothing will surprise her. The best gift is a father's blessing. Well, she doesn't ask. ﻿Our family broke up a long time ago. With you it is easy to talk, Dima. Dima! ﻿A picture to remember you by! ﻿A picture! Dima? I'll be right there. Dima! Where are you going? ﻿Equipment! Get back! ﻿Come here quick! ﻿Why did I tell you? ﻿Jamila! ﻿Jamila. This way! Come on. Where's Jamila? ﻿- I'm…without her. - What? I'm not going without her. Who's that? I'm not going without her! Comrade Captain! Comrade Captain, let's go! ﻿- I wanted to ask you… - You have a bruised brain! ﻿What do you want to ask me? Turn off the music! ﻿- The music is in your head! - Don't worry, your memory will come back. ﻿- Come on, Comrade Captain. - Dima! Let's go! ﻿Dima! I've remembered! ﻿Where are my boys? …aid to the Syrian people. Shaberov! There's someone here to see you. In Syria you are defending your own home, not allowing militants into Russia. All right, let's do it again. ﻿We're not accusing anybody. We just want to get to the bottom of this. ﻿Dmitri Leonidovich, are you aware of your guilt? Tragic guilt. We want to hear you. ﻿And you're silent and silent. ﻿The file says you were wounded four times while clearing mines. Well, there's a contusion there, too. Were the injuries sustained directly in the performance of direct duty? ﻿- Would the amputation interfere? - It would. I can still fight. If you have balls, clubs, up to five things. ﻿- Excuse me? - A Mace. ﻿-Yeah… Tomorrow, you go home! ﻿- Listen… - You'll get your money at home. Listen, I can't go yet! In Palmyra they planted a ton of saltpeter under the theater! ﻿You can't blow it up, the robot won't go through. I'm needed there! ﻿- Look, it's not mine… - Where's yours? They didn't bring it back. ﻿There was stuff in there… I'm sorry about my razor. My daughter gave it to me. ﻿- Yes? - Can I? ﻿- Shaberov, for the discharge? - Yeah. Listen, Yul, do you know if a girl was admitted in with me? Jamila. The Syrians were taken to Tartus. ﻿- Why, what condition was she in? - I don't know. Thank you. Leshchenko. ﻿You go ahead. ﻿- Group, line up! - The unloading of the plane will be complete soon. Those departing homebound will be able to begin boarding. ﻿- Calm the dog down! ﻿- Makarsky! - Calm down, calm down! Don't step on it. Water, water for him! Somebody help him. Not all at once. ﻿Give him some air! Hold his head, hold his head! ﻿- Makarsky! - Here! Run, call a nurse or something! ﻿- Where's the infirmary? - It's my first time here, just like you! ﻿Lieutenant Makarsky, follow your orders! ﻿- Yes, sir! - Run! ﻿- Are you okay? - I'm fine! Zhilin! Kostya! Hold him, come on. Dima, nice to meet you. I doubt it, but I appreciate the courtesy. Forget it, it was stuffy. Turbulence. Are you going home? ﻿Look, uh… I'm not in a big hurry to get home. I can help you. Here, here! Over here! ﻿Don't count on the kid. The medics won't let him out. ﻿They're overreacting, they'll haul him to hospitals. Listen, I don't decide these things. He's a lieutenant, you're a captain. ﻿I have to go to Palmyra. Look, it's… there's a challenge there. ﻿It's the hardest, you know. ﻿You know what it is? That's my dream. Let's get on board! Let's get in formation, Comrade Captain! No, I won't let you stand in formation. First time in combat? Don't count on the dog much. Stay, sit down! You'll be retraining that dog for a month. I'd like to introduce you. This is, so to speak, the legend of the sappers, Dmitry Shaberov, nicknamed "Already". A sapper is wrong once! ﻿And Dima has made a mistake… how many already? Four times! He made mistakes … already. Squad, attention! ﻿- At ease! -At ease! Comrade General! Greetings! ﻿- Shaberov, what are you doing here? - Sharing my experience. ﻿The boys arrived, they don't know the specifics. I told them about the land mines. Tell me about it. Well, they put half a ton of explosives under the stele. Definitely not with a timer. When was it planted? ﻿A long time ago, even before the offensive started. There was a lot of work to be done. ﻿Well, I can't tell you in three words. -I've been assigned to do logistics. ﻿Specifically, the Homs-Palmyra highway. Come on, come on, come on! I'm to board immediately, Comrade General. ﻿- They're sending me home. - Dima, I'm gonna have to ask you to hold off. ﻿There's a big event coming up in Palmyra. ﻿The resources involved are serious: equipment, officer teams. Tired? Want to go home? I will help, Comrade General. ﻿- Report on the situation! - Ahead of us, according to the plan, there will be an orange orchard! ﻿- Five, seven hours, no less. - This quadrant is clear. Yes. There's fighting in the village to your left as you go. Over! ﻿- We'll stop right here. - I don't understand. Explain. That's where my boys died. Is there a grave there? Three minutes. Salaam! Look, look… Jamilya. You don't know? ﻿Jamila. Palmyra. ﻿-Don't split up. -Leave the water. You're from Homs? Homs. Got it. Thank you. Dima! Dima! Comrade Captain! ﻿- Alive! - Riyadh! You're here! ﻿- Yes. - As a sapper? ﻿- No, as support. - Yeah, well…I didn't give you a diploma. Copy that. ﻿Team, the break is over! Get in the car! ﻿- Listen, do you remember Jamila? - I do. ﻿- I still have her phone number. - Let's keep moving. I'll text you the number, see if you can find her. ﻿- Dima! - If you find out anything, let me know. ﻿- Call him. - Let's go, Dima! Dim, let's go… ﻿- Not Dima, but Comrade Captain. - My bad, Comrade Captain. The order is to proceed. We shouldn't have… come here then. We should have just given you diplomas and everybody would be alive. And Muslim would be alive. No, our enemies are killing us. This is war! The road is blocked! ﻿- Do you want to? Take a look. - No. They have taken over the village! The Syrian army is trying to take them out. Affirmative! Do not interfere! ﻿Roger, we'll be waiting. Over and out! Keep your head down! Jamila! Hello, Jamila. ﻿Yes, I have the phone. ﻿How are you feeling? ﻿It's not me, it's the guys. ﻿I wasn't thinking at all. ﻿Yeah, we'll be in Palmyra. ﻿Hopefully soon. ﻿Jamila, maybe you can help. ﻿Yeah, it's a deal. ﻿Okay. Yeah, you too. ﻿- Dima! Go back! Where are you going? - The tank was hit! Captain Shaberov, get back! ﻿Team, in position! Dima! - Give me the tarp! - There it is. ﻿- To the ground, to the ground! - That's it! Grab it, grab it, grab it! Come on, let's go! ﻿Pull, pull, pull! ﻿Follow me! Take cover! ﻿- Where were you going without orders? - I told you, the tank was hit. ﻿- You could have been killed! - But we saved the kid. ﻿Let's go. ORCHARD, HOMS - PALMIRA Let's not waste any time. First and foremost, it's distance. ﻿Next. The right way to work with the objects of search. ﻿- Dim, everyone wait, please. - Yeah. I want you to contact me if you find anything. ﻿Do not make decisions on your own. ﻿- Is that clear to everyone? - It's clear. ﻿- Let's suit up and go. - Yes, sir. ﻿-Dima! ﻿Captain Shaberov, didn't you hear what I said? ﻿- Trap! Group, in place! There's an IED on the tree. ﻿I can see more from here. Dim, go back to the starting point. ﻿- Let's get the robot going. -Yeah. ﻿Double-action trap. ﻿Makarsky, come here! ﻿- I'm coming, Comrade Captain. - Stand down! ﻿Dima. ﻿Captain Shaberov, what's not clear? OK, let's go back. Dim, let's agree right away. ﻿You don't do anything without an order, okay? Do you realize the traps are for us? Explain. The fishing line is stretched where? Right there. Well. ﻿And all our lives… we look under our feet. ﻿I'm filing a report. Pity about the garden. ﻿So much work is put in here. Group, fall back. Pull back to the starting point. JABEL ﻿- Look, it's warmed up. - Fried! Thank you. Thank you. I need a toy for a little girl. ﻿- Alaykum - Salaam. For a girl…so that she would smile! ﻿- Saalam. Is it free? - Yes. For a girl. Do you understand? ﻿Here. ﻿-Hello! -Ah, Rusi. Hi, daughter. ﻿- Dad, something important? - No. I… ﻿I'm in a meeting. They said the price is $15,000, they can't change it. Tanya, wait. Tanya, when's the wedding? Hi. ﻿What's your name? His name is Daredevil. Do you know why? Why, Dad? Because Daredevil never cries. ﻿I cry sometimes. ﻿Rarely. There you go. And you take your cue from Daredevil. I want to hug and kiss him. Lizunya, you're my darling, you're my girl. ﻿Liza, Daredevil says we'll get there before you learn to dance. I can't do it. You can do it! Whose daughter are you? ﻿You're Captain Zhilin's daughter! Try it with the music. ﻿Or sing a song. ﻿Daredevil made up a song for you. Let's sing it. ﻿We're free beasts. We're like lions and bears. Mom! We are ships of the desert. You remember my name -- Daredevil. ﻿He lives in the desert, He doesn't drink water. ﻿I drink water, that means I'm not a camel. ﻿Daredevil and I are friends. You can't forget our names. ﻿His name is Daredevil and mine is Konstantin, ﻿When Daddy dances, Daddy is number one. ﻿I'm dancing to your name, Lizunya! ﻿Thank you, thank you, thank you. ﻿I love you. Palmyra was founded by a king of the Semitic Hurrite tribe 3,500 years ago. ﻿It was such an important city that the Egyptians didn't bother to go the long, long way. ﻿They lost thousands of warriors. ﻿Excuse me, this is my fiancé. ﻿His name is Rashid, and that's Arabic for "prudent," but he's not prudent at all, as you can see. ﻿You should have called him Hmar, it means "donkey." Daughter, hi. ﻿Listen, you and I have been kind of… ﻿we haven't been able to talk. ﻿So I thought I'd record a message for you. ﻿You know, we have this expression that when a sapper dies, his soul doesn't have time to fly away. GAS INSTALLATION HOMS - PALMYRA HIGHWAY Base, Base. Arrived at set point. ﻿Proceeding to check for explosive objects. Over. This temple is from the 3rd century AD. ﻿The time of Zenobia. ﻿She had a great army. ﻿But Emperor Aurelian killed them all and led the captive Zenobia through Rome in golden chains. ﻿- In gold chains? - Yeah. - I'll go home and read about it. - You should have read that in school. ﻿Wait here. Captain Shaberov, it's the 21st century, what kind of superstition is that? The phone was recently installed. ﻿Ten to fifteen minutes. Explain. The apparatus is cold. ﻿And the battery is full. ﻿It feels like they're around here somewhere. Dim, let's get this over with and then we'll continue looking around the station. Give me the incendiary tubes. It's kind of weird. ﻿Everything's burned for miles, and here's a lawn, a fountain, palm trees. There's nothing strange about it. ﻿It's just that Barmaley were selling gas. Stable source of income. ﻿- I'll put it up. - Go ahead. Good. ﻿The tank stays, the compressor stays. That's it. I'm going to stay, Comrade Captain. Don't you want to ask your commanding officer? Sorry. Dima, you got five minutes. - Take a landmine and get back to the starting line. - Got it. What's with the wires? ﻿Come here. ﻿Where did you go…? Allahu akbar! Bitch, unclench it! Makarsky! Makarsky, get back! There's Dima! Makarsky, take cover! Where you put your stump! Get back! Team, in position! So, what's going on here? ﻿There you go. For as long as I've been in the service, this is the first time I've ever held a belt. It's not a belt, it's a vest. It's a vest. That's it, folks, let's back up. Let's go! It's not just the second fuse. ﻿There's a safety loop. Got it? Did you see the gyroscope? ﻿- It's off. - Are you sure? It would've blown up when I picked it up. I move it and what happens? Boom! So you brought an IED to the control post, huh? Well done, hero! ﻿I'm gonna punch you in the face! I'm not gonna defend myself. I'm a little tired today. To disarm it, you have to figure out where and by whom it was made. Good, huh! ﻿Any mine works on a signal-response principle. ﻿What's our mission? To bypass the signal. Right. ﻿And suppress… ﻿…the response. That's it. ﻿There's no such thing as unextractable mines. ﻿There are just risks, justified and unjustified. I say, the risk is justified. And if people die by your side, Dima? Not your fault? ﻿Could it have happened to anyone? ﻿- But it's happening to you for some reason. - Listen, don't be such a bitch, huh? ﻿Well, the station is intact, the national treasure is saved. ﻿What else do you need? What? ﻿The charge is left! It's gonna blow up! ﻿- Group, take cover! - Take cover! The man with the belt is dead! There you are, there he is. ﻿There's 50 meters between you! ﻿The sniper shoots at the head. ﻿If the corpse doesn't blow up, you approach, fully suited. ﻿The visor is down. ﻿You're gloved, you're encasing it, then you're blowing it up. ﻿And only in that order! ﻿Is that clear? ﻿Get up! Remove the IED from the camp. The Russians have finished the job, you can go. Suicide vehicle! Allahu akbar! Group, to battle! ﻿Got it! Keep your head down! ﻿- Team, take cover! - Fire! Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar! Focus! Fire! Allahu akbar! ﻿- Group, fall back! - Go! Don't shoot! There's Dima! ﻿Allahu akbar! ﻿Cut off the road! Take cover! Take cover! FIELD CAMP DEMINING GROUPS Comrade Major General, Comrade Major General, Captain Shaberov routinely violates security requirements while performing explosive items clearance tasks. ﻿Completely disobeys me and does not follow my orders. Well, you'll have to be patient, Captain. ﻿Shaberov is the most experienced sapper. We can't do without him. There are no mines that can't be removed. ﻿There are risks - justified and unjustified. Major General, he doesn't know how to work as a team. You know, Captain, that a sapper always relies only on himself. If I'm talking to you, it means what? The risk is justified. Take your report back. Major General, I didn't want to tell you, but Shaberov brought an improvised explosive device to the personnel location. Can somebody confirm that? Yes, sir! ﻿- Lieutenant Makarsky! - Here! ﻿- To me! - Yes, sir! Answer the questions posed! Good day, Comrade Major General! Lieutenant, do you confirm that Captain Shaberov brought an IED to the group's location? Yes, sir. Affirmative. You've been reassigned and suspended from assignment! ﻿So just wait. Comrade Major General, allow me! I can help in Palmyra. That's it, Shaberov! The commander's report is signed. ﻿How many reports there were, Comrade General! ﻿- Why now, Igor Gennadyevich? - Dima, you're a good specialist. ﻿I think one of the best. ﻿But you can't work as a team! The sapper relies only on himself. ﻿New bomb finder with increased depth of search, up to 4 meters… I'll dance! One! Two! ﻿Our job is not show business! ﻿We risk our lives! What's your name? ﻿- Shahud. - Shahud. Cheers, Shahud! Well hello, Palmyra. Daughter, hi! Hi, hi, hi! Do you know where I am? In Syria. ﻿Dad, did something happen? I might be able to make it to your wedding. To the wedding? That's good. ﻿Look, Dad, I'm late. Well then, run. Bye. Kiss and kiss. Listen. Tchaikovsky. Okay. Here's Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Come on, Dim. Come on. Dim, good luck! Long live Syria! Palmira is ours! From tomorrow we begin the tasks of clearing Tadmor. ﻿Good luck! Senior Lieutenant Fedotov. Group, to the car. Comrade Captain, all the necessary equipment is unloaded! ﻿- Well done, keep moving. - Yes, sir! ﻿Dima! Dim, go to the camp. What, where are you going now? Not far. Kostya! ﻿Can I help you? ﻿I won't get in the way. You won't, Dim. What, where are you going? Barmaley booby-trapped the well before they left. The only one in the whole village. They asked for help. What do you mean "asked"? The elders asked for help from headquarters, and we got orders. ﻿Be careful! Blow it up. What? What are you looking at? ﻿- Blow it up. - There's only one well. You see that? That's from a well. ﻿You know how long it's been? New fingers haven't grown back. Makarsky! Let's move out. Blow it up, blow it up. Whatever the commander says. Come on, guys. Be careful. ﻿Palmyra has been liberated. ﻿They need you there alive. Stay in touch. ﻿Let's go. Sadyk! How do you say "retreat"? Retreat! ﻿Retreat! OK… I see a landmine. Which one? Multiple. ﻿I wish we'd brought Dima. The village was checked. We checked it. Comrade Captain, maybe we should blow it up, huh? Continue to look around. I'd blow it up. Jamila, hello. ﻿I just got a free minute so I thought I'd give you a call. ﻿I'm already near Palmyra. ﻿But unfortunately, I probably won't be able to see you. ﻿Some other time. Good job. You were right to blow it up. RPG! ﻿Get 'em up, get 'em all up! Let's go! ﻿Look, do you understand? ﻿Where are you going? Hello! ﻿What did he say? ﻿Where did you go? ﻿Why are you sitting there? What are you doing, man? ﻿That's my boys in there. You're gonna give me the car and the people. What are you doing? Let's move out! Beacon, this is Viking. ﻿Zhilin's group came under fire. ﻿The village of Tevalva. ﻿I don't know who gave the order! ﻿Captain Shaberov. ﻿Can't wait. That's it, over. ﻿That way, that way! Russki, Russki. Russki! Russki! Hey, hey, hey! Don't shoot! ﻿Hey, hey! ﻿- Allahu akbar! - Damn… He was with him, with him. Where is ﻿Zhilin? ﻿- ﻿Zhilin. - Hey! Second one. ﻿Where's the second one? ﻿Where is he? ﻿Where is he? ﻿Was he alive? You're alive! I'm alive! ﻿He was murdered! -Ah… Alive? ﻿You saw them get killed, didn't you? ﻿Did you see them killed? You did? ﻿Why are you alive? Why are you alive? You were standing guard! ﻿You were in the cordon! Why were they killed? ﻿Why were they killed? Our own. Is that Daredevil you have? Daredevil. ﻿It was a tough fight there and there… His blood? Yes. Don't worry about his body coming back, it's tough right now…but at any price… You just have to wait a little while. ﻿You just have to wait a little while. Well, there's no hurry now… ﻿Yes? Ira, please forgive me, maybe I'm saying something wrong… Please forgive me… ﻿I'll probably get Liza, right? ﻿Yeah. ﻿And you tell her that… that daddy's coming back. ﻿- Ir, I… - Listen! ﻿It's not really lying. ﻿We'll say he'll be back, we just won't say if he's alive or… ﻿I'm sorry, I… ﻿She loves him very much and. ﻿And she'll find out, well, later, at the funeral. Please. Okay Liza. ﻿Liz! Hello. Hello, Lizaveta. Hi, Daredevil. ﻿Why so dirty? He… he fought. ﻿He was… was wounded. And my daddy fought? He was defending him when Daredevil got hit. Is he coming back soon? Soon. Daredevil, are you a real officer? Real officers don't lie. ﻿Give me your word of honor that he'll be back. Yes. Say it… Honestly. ﻿He'll be back. And Mama's crying. RUSSIAN AIR FORCES ﻿- I can assist in the buyout. - No. I can identify. There are officers from the Reconciliation Center. ﻿It's all classified, they have their connections. ﻿They know who to give money to, who to have coffee with, who to smear in a bloody mess. ﻿The ransom for Zhilin's body has been arranged. When they bring him back, you'll identify him. A sapper always comes in handy. Not you, Dima. ﻿Forget about resigning. Yes, sir. Base, I'm flight two, I'm in the given quadrant. ﻿I have a clear line of sight to the site. Coming in for a landing. Let's go! Ready to go! Base, it's okay. They're waiting for us. Let's get Zhilin's body and go! Rocket! We're under attack! ﻿Firing traps! ﻿I'm hit! The engine's okay for now. Pulling out, I'll attack. - Allahu akbar! - Allahu akbar! It turns out that this group is allied with the Islamic Front. ﻿- They set up the ambush. - What about Zhilin's body? Do we know? ﻿- We're looking! - Listen, they know we're getting it. ﻿They know we'll punish them. They're still cheating. First, on duty at all times. How copy? ﻿- What have we got here, Major? -Air reconnaissance. ﻿Target coordinates confirmed. Roger. We're going to engage. Keeping an eye on the target. There is a detonation. Target destroyed. I have confirmation. Target is hit. ﻿- Hello. - Hello. ﻿What's up? Another group has offered to buy us out of the body. Can we trust it? We did, we negotiated, we got the body, we did forensics, it's no good. Who are they? ﻿- They're called Jash Al-Sham. - What do they want? Money? No, an exchange. For Jihadi John. Executioner, blogger. Cutting heads off. ﻿- This one? - Him. He ate soldiers' livers for hype. Dmitry Leonidovich, the operation is stopped. Wait, well, maybe they're not lying. The officers of the Reconciliation Center are dead. The pilots are dead. ﻿There's a check underway: who's to blame, why were they ambushed? ﻿- Their bodies have to be recovered. - Well, maybe the Syrians? ﻿They have specialists, they have agents. Mukhabarat. They won't go for that. ﻿They won't refuse, but they won't do anything. Comrade Officers! At ease! ﻿So, Shaberov, you wanted to work in Palmyra, didn't you? ﻿- Yes, sir! - So hurry up. The city has been liberated. ﻿It's time to save history. For everyone involved, you know. Major General, I have one cadet left alive. ﻿I didn't have time to give him his diploma. May I? Will you allow two or three days along with the road? ﻿Dima, why are you still a captain? ﻿- Well… - Don't answer that. ﻿The question doesn't need an answer. Let's go over the operational environment. Salman, are you in there? Yes, I'll be right there. ﻿Yes. ﻿Ah, Riyadh, hi! Hi. ﻿Yes, she called me herself, thank you. Where are you now, by the way? Great. Be there, I'm on my way there. I'll hand you your diploma. ARAB SYRIAN ARMY MILITARY BASE Dima! Lovely friend! I'm always happy to see you. ﻿Especially when the friend almost went to a better world without saying goodbye. Hello! Listen, Salman, tell me, you said you had a relative on the police force. Rafiq. Nephew. Not in the police, in Mukhabarat. ﻿Oh, he's a scary man. Look, that's the kind of guy I need. I need my body back. ﻿You know how it is. You make a deal, you buy it back, you trade it… ﻿..and the body's wrong. You can't trust them. Who is he to you? Friend. DNA? At least two months to research. ﻿- Well, Salman, you're a doctor! - Doctors don't do that! I googled it while I was driving. You can isolate DNA and four other markers. ﻿Just buy a rapid test and that's it! 10 minutes. ﻿- Paternity test? - Of course! That's what I'm talking about. ﻿The camel was covered in blood. We'll cut it up, take a clean sample. That's a smart idea, Dima. You're smart. I'm the one with the bruised head. What about you? You drink too much, mate! ﻿- All of Syria is drinking. - Well, what happened? Fine! ﻿I'll make the call. Thank you, brother! ﻿- What's up? - He'll call you back. ﻿Dima, what's the happiest time of your life? ﻿Well, the one that you want to live your whole life there? ﻿Stay there, don't change anything? Listen, well, I… ﻿I like the service. I'm asking you about happiness. Do you like the bruised brain? ﻿Your comrades torn to pieces. ﻿And I had such a time. ﻿Six years in the dormitory of the Voronezh Medical School. ﻿The first time I walked in the door and in the same minute I realized. ﻿Girls… ﻿Freedom… Alcohol! Rafik. ﻿Rafik has agreed, waiting for us. ﻿You can't say no to your uncle. ﻿You don't know your own family in Russia. ﻿The most important thing for us is whose blood is in you. Listen, let's move out in half an hour. ﻿I'll be back to headquarters in a jiffy. Don't forget the camel. Come on, come on. Riyadh Abouhaj is presented with a diploma from the military sapper course. ﻿Okay, go ahead. ﻿Hello. Hello, Jamila. ﻿Yes, I'll be in Palmyra. I don't know when yet. ﻿Is this your house? ﻿Sure, I'll remember that. ﻿Near the police station by the mosque. Yes. ﻿I'll definitely find it. Goodbye, Jamila. Rafiq said, not a phone call. Buy it back for money. Fine. And Jihadi John? ﻿- Says money is more reliable. - Do you believe him at all? I don't really believe him, I really hope so. ﻿He says we'll work it out tomorrow. Coffee? PALMYRA ﻿Buy flowers! ﻿Salaam, salaam! ﻿Great, how much? Hey, handsome guy! Who are you giving these flowers? You'd better give them to me! Try the walnut jam. ﻿Show pictures of your daughter. Jamilya… let's keep it on a first name basis. Please show me, Dima. Well… here you go. When's the wedding? I don't know. ﻿Well, let's make a call. Let's find out. ﻿Come on, Dima? ﻿- Hi. - Daughter, hi. ﻿- Hello. I'm Vyacheslav. - Dima. ﻿- Well, then I'm Slava. Now, just a moment. - Hello, Slava. It's a pleasure. I was just calling to find out when your wedding is? Maybe I'll have time to come with a parental blessing ﻿- There's not gonna be a wedding, Dim. - Why not? Father, we're not having a wedding. We're having a trip, a cruise. Great! I love to travel, too. ﻿I'm in Palmyra right now, by the way. ﻿Meet Jamila. Hello. My name is Jamila. Hello. Slava. I'm Tatiana, nice to meet you. ﻿So you had to go to war to meet a woman? ﻿See, at least that makes sense. Tan, Dima is in a peacekeeping operation. ﻿Well, he's taking a risk for the sake of… That was in the last war, after which my mother couldn't stand it and left. I did a lot of stupid things back then. I was wounded. ﻿Okay, daughter, what are we talking about now? ﻿- Your mom's happy now, right? - Yes. ﻿Married. Husband comes home from work every day. When there's no war, it's easy to be happy. ﻿We don't have a war now. Right, Dad? Slava, where's the cruise going? Signal rocket… ﻿Pick up the phone. ﻿You call and we'll meet. ﻿- Have you ever been to Moscow? - You're inviting me? Well, I'm quitting soon. ﻿I'll be free. ﻿I can start a new life. Invitation accepted ﻿Dima. It's a good thing I found you. I called you myself. I found you. Remember what not to do when redeeming your friend's body. No smiling, no gestures, no unnecessary words. ﻿Panic, swearing, threats, and any display of emotion can cost lives. ﻿If something goes wrong, he'll give a conditional sign. ﻿If he does that, then it's bad. ﻿If at some point he says "bring the money," it's bad. What group are they from? ﻿- The kind that… - I got it. He'll make arrangements and call. ﻿They'll take us to the body, you take a look, I'll do the test. Shawarma! Shawarma! Rafik, I hear you're not involved in exchanges. I don't deal with prisoners of war. I want to buy a dead body. You're right, it's less trouble with dead ones. Russki's body? Remember that we have a test with us. We will know if you want to cheat us. DNA. Ten minutes and the answer is ready! Show the money! If I show the money, and the body is not it…. You will not get away alive! No hurry! Take your time! Calmly. Phone. Phone. Bring money. They carry the money. All clear. ﻿The body is fresh. ﻿You shouldn't have bought the test. ﻿The phone is ringing. Says the militants wanted to cheat us. ﻿Offers to have coffee. Why don't you answer? I don't want to have anything to do with you! Don't ever address me! Forget my name! - Salaam! - Salam… He's dead, motherfucker! Look, Barmaley didn't lock his phone. ﻿There's a photo, there's a video. ﻿Give this to the techs in case it comes in handy. I have no connection. I'm really looking forward to the call. We put jammers on when we're working. ﻿It's off now, check it out. ﻿- Who is he? - It doesn't matter. ﻿- Dima. - Don't put your hands down. I wanted to call you. ﻿Jayshe-Sham offers an exchange… Honest! ﻿For Jihadi John, a blogger. I know who that is. ﻿Who's the exchange for? For Konstantin Zhilin, alive. He's alive? Yes. You can put your hands down. ﻿They say the meeting is tomorrow at 12:00. ﻿By the dried-up river. ﻿Here are the coordinates. ﻿They said the exchange would go like this. ﻿They say you have to bring Jihadi John yourself. Beautiful hands. Salaam. How did your family die? Fire. Are you with them because you're getting revenge? Yes. ﻿No. ﻿At first yes, and then I got confused. ﻿Just wanted to live. A lot of people died at that crossroads. ﻿Syrian soldiers, militia. ﻿I didn't know them. ﻿I knew my cadets. ﻿Young fellows all. They wanted to live, too. It was just a routine assignment, Dima. ﻿This is war. ﻿If it wasn't for the war, we wouldn't have met. ﻿I didn't lie yesterday. ﻿Will you stay? Will I see you tomorrow? ﻿No! I'm in the waiting zone. Approaching line of sight. ﻿Over. Observing objects in two pickups. ﻿"Raven", continue your surveillance. Unpack it. ﻿Sniper has been in position since yesterday. ﻿Drones are in control of the situation. ﻿All clear. Come here. ﻿Translate. ﻿You go with him. ﻿If you do what he says, maybe you'll stay alive. ﻿If you understand, nod. Damn it. Here you go. Get him over here. There you are. And now you, Kostya, have already… ﻿What's wrong with you? Vest. Whoa. Explosive device! ﻿- Group, take cover. - Hold it. ﻿Right. ﻿Well, let's see. There's a button in the right hand. Hold it tight. ﻿Is your jacket free? ﻿- Yes. - Don't move your head. ﻿Beginning initial examination. ﻿The light bulb is on. That means the network is live. Right. ﻿Right. ﻿Whoa! That's how you stand. ﻿Tilt sensor. ﻿Right. ﻿- How are we supposed to disarm it? - Block it. ﻿- Block the contact. - Right. ﻿So we'll use the antenna. Dim, there's a phone. The phone won't work. ﻿- Why? - Jammer? Right. ﻿Insert wire, tighten the… ﻿Got it. ﻿Come on, let's get your jacket off. ﻿The bomber's pretty handy. He made in his workshop. ﻿Experienced man, and they sent the devils. He said that if someone wanted to take it off, he wouldn't be able to ﻿Yeah. ﻿We'll give it a shot. ﻿Okay. ﻿Wow, you've got a scrape here…! ﻿There you go. ﻿Hold it tight. ﻿Hush, hush, hush. Dim, be careful. That's it. ﻿Good for you. ﻿There you go. ﻿What do we have here? ﻿What a bitch! He wasn't lazy, got us all wired up in here. Dim, we gotta go through every, you know, every-every wire. Call…No call. ﻿We've got a thin one right here. Wait. ﻿Dim, are you sure about this one? Stone, scissors, paper. ﻿Pencil, fire, water. That's it. ﻿The lightbulb went out. ﻿Which means that. The circuit is no longer live. Right. ﻿Release the button. I can't. ﻿Tired. Let's do it together. ﻿There you go. ﻿That's it. ﻿That's it, ﻿that's it. ﻿That's it, that's it. ﻿That's it, that's it, that's it. ﻿That's it. ﻿Well, let's take the vest off. Yes. ﻿It's not like we're dragging an IED with you to our base. Yes? - Dim… - Why? ﻿Freeze. Dim, what's wrong? ﻿Gyroscope? And a timer. ﻿47 seconds. Dim, go away. ﻿Not much time. ﻿You don't have time to check everything, turn it off. ﻿We'll both die. ﻿Go away! Hands up. So, look. ﻿Listen to me. ﻿I'm going to hold the vest now, and you get out gently. ﻿Don't pull on the back panel. ﻿- Dima… - Go! My death is not yours. I promised Elizaveta that you would come back. You have a daughter, too. Well, mine's an adult, she'll get over it somehow. ﻿- What about the gyroscope? - Run! ﻿No… 17 seconds. How… Daughter, hi. ﻿Listen, I've been having trouble talking to you, so I thought I'd write you a message. ﻿You know, we have this expression, well, that when a sapper dies, his soul doesn't have time to fly away. ﻿The body gets torn into atoms too fast. ﻿Daddy. And I think if something happens to me, the shards of my soul, they stay in those who love me, whom I love and have loved. ﻿And when those who knew me are gone, well, then the angels will pick up the shards and take them where they belong. ﻿In the meantime… I'll be right here. The militants retreating left a huge number of mines, land mines, and improvised explosive devices. ﻿And basically today, the combined sapper unit is starting to clear the historic part of Palmyra already. ﻿Already…
