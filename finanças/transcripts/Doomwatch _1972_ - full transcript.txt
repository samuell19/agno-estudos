Come on. Come on. Why? Better? It's alright. Well, all that was twelve months ago. And know we gotta find out what effect the oil and the new detergent they used to disperse the oil has had on seashore life. On Balfe huh? Well Balfe is the nearest island, and the one worst hit at the time. We've changed the program three times. And the answer is still the same. Still the same. The results would look very ugly on a graph. Put them on a graph then. Then what? Perhaps too much can frighten the petrol companies into stopping using lead additives. Heck, you'll need more than that. So we want samples of uh, seaweed.. Gastropods, bivalves... crustacea... a few gulls if you can get em, without killing yourself. But I don't suppose there were many effected. Anyway, don't stay away too long. Supposing I like it, can't I have a few days rest? No! I shouldn't need to be there more than a day, I ah... Ok, well have a good trip. Thanks, see ya. So you're the ball spin? That's right. You'll find em in a strange... close slow down ball. How often to you call? Ohhh... Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. Weather permitting. Could you make an extra call and pick me up tomorrow? In and out quick eh? No, No but I should be finished by tomorrow afternoon. Here we are. You can see the village. Morning, Mrs. Straker. Morning Alex. Tom still poor even? Oh, he'll soon be up and about. Here your mail. Morning. Oh this is Doctor... Shaw. Doctor? Come all the way from London. That's the lot. You, staying for a drink then? No, no, I best get back. I'll see you tomorrow then eh? Bout three be alright? Fine, fine. Alright boy, we can can back now. You're alright, I'll give you a hand. Yes? This it? I'll just dump this inside shall I? No. It's alright. I'll take it now. I'm looking for somewhere to stay for the night. We don't cater for visitors. There must be somewhere? No. We're just little cottages see? Rector's own a big house here. Alright I'll ask at the rector then, where's that? Round the corner on the left. You can't miss it. Thank you. No, you mustn't. Who's there? What are you doing? An, I didn't think anyone was in. What do you want? Well I just arrived on the island and I want somewhere to stay for the night. Why come here? This is not a lodging house. Well, I was told I could find accommodation. Told? Who are you anyway? My name is Shaw, Dr. Shaw. I can't help you! I can't help you. Well just a minute... I can't help you! Come in. Use the back door. What can I do for you sir? Are you the policeman? That's me. My name is Shaw... I've just arrived and I'm having difficulty in finding somewhere to sleep. Oh, well I imagine you would have. Just for the one night, I'll be off again tomorrow. You got business here? I don't see what it's got a do with you but yes, I have, yes. Well, you could ask Miss Johnson up at the Bobby. Up here on the lane leading into the woods. Thank you. Just the one night is it? Just the one night, yes. Come in. Your coffee Doctor. Thank you. Did you enjoy your supper? Delicious, thank you. Ah, are you going to join me for a cup? Oh, no. That's for Miss Brown, my other guest. Why is this place called the Balfe do you suppose? I's a common word... It's used in many dialects. It's mean hut or cottage and comes from the same root as the word, booth. Which is the north border and from the Middle English meaning bu-flay meaning to dwell. I take it you're the school mistress? What's your name? Victoria Brahm. It seemed boorish to sit under the same roof and not to introduce ourselves. It's been rather one sided so far. My name is Dell Shore. Come in. Thank you. Nice fire. Thank you. Nice room. Thank you. Is the food always so awful on this island? Yes, I think so. you'll get used to it. You're not an islander are you? No, I'm a foreigner. How long you been here? Two years. How did you find them when you first came here? Was it difficult at first? Yes, they were. They're just beginning to accept me now. I think it would take longer with me, they seem an odd lot. I mean... don't they? Why have you come here? To study the effects on seashore life of that tanker sinking here last year. Oh, you're a scientist. That's right, I work for Doomwatch. The pollution people. That's anti-pollution I hope. How long are you gonna stay here? Everybody asks me that. It just seemed polite to ask. Not the way they ask it. Hey, look at this. No, no, I don't want to be put away. Well, they're just going for a walk. At this time of the night, you must be joking? Something strange, they seemed to be forcing the old man along. Well maybe he doesn't like walking. - Do you know who they were? - No I don't. It was too dark and I couldn't see. He's coming in here. Alright, just leave him be. Afternoon. Can I get a drink here? Just give Mrs. Straker a shout. Betty! I'll get you a drink. No, no my turn. Yes? Yes, I think I'd like a beer, please. Another couple over here, too, please Betty. I'll get it I said! Oh, c'mon George, let me get it. I know how things be with you at the moment. What do you mean? Well, I didn't mean that. Okay, thanks. You buy me a drink. What did you mean saying that? Easy now. - George! - Think you're so big! Clean it up. You be lucky. Damn problem. You want pain? - You never bloodied up... - That's enough of that. Get out! Get out, George! Come back when you got control of yourself. Dr. Shaw? Your beer. Oh yeah. Yes? Hello? It's Doomwatch in London. Yes? I've got a new phone to Dr. Quist. Hold on a minute, please. Your through now. Hello? Hello! Dr. Quist? It's Dell! How are you? Fine, fine thank you. I've put the specimens on the ferry and you should get them first thing in the morning. What you mean? Where are you? Still on Balfe? Why? Uh, well I haven't got enough stuff yet. I need some more gull's eggs. Gull's eggs? But, I tell you, they're unlikely to be affected anyway. Yes, I agree we can't have 100 many of them. We need a good selection of eggs, I think. Dell, what are ya talking about? I said that it... Eh, quite, quite. So, I'll just stay on here for a few days more, okay? Listen to me! What? I said... I'm sorry this line's gone very bad. I had better ring off now. Bye, bye! Goodbye! It's strange, that whenever I say something to Dr. Shaw that he doesn't want to hear telephone always breaks down. - Tom? - Yeah? Can l come in? Eh, go to hell. You alright? Told ya, I told ya, go to hell. He didn't go, that doctor. Says he"ll stay a few days. What for? Collecting gull's eggs, he says. Find out what he's really after. I'll try. - Does your bucket need emptying? - No! Pepper? What? My eyes are gone. It's the shutters. It's dark in here. No. I can't get them to focus. Oh God. What can we do? I don't know! Tom? You won't try and get out again, will ya? I'm trying not to, Betty. Hello. I say! We don't like that, you know. 'Round here. I'm sorry? We don't like that. Taking people's likeness. I didn't know that. I'll ask next time. Mind you do. We don't like that sort of carry-on at all, as a matter of fact. Okay. Hey boy! C'mon! C'mon boy! Hey, shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo there! C'mon ya! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Dang it! Get out! Come in. What can I do for you, Dr. Shaw? Constable, I think you better come with me. What's up? You know the, the wood near the Balfe? Aye. Well, there's a body there. Buried. Whose body? I don't know. It's a young girl or a child. I'm not sure. Why not? Right. Let's go. Where's he going? Do you recognize him? Have you seen Al? Here. Right. Someone's been here. How do you mean? I left it uncovered. Well, there's nothing here. I told you someone's been here! Look you can see for yourself. The ground's newly turned over. Well, we might as well make sure now we've come all the way up here. Ah, there's nothing there. Forget it! Just what are you playing at, Dr. Shaw? Can ll come in? Oh, Dr. Shaw. Yes, come in. Would you mind calling me Dell? I need a friend. I thought you'd left. Couldn't tear myself away. They make one feel so welcome here. I'm sorry if I sound so busy. How are you, hmm? Why do you need a friend? I need someone to tell me what's going on on this island. Not much. We don't get much excitement on Balfe. You could fool me. Do you know that whenever I leave the confines of this village someone follows me? - Follows you? - With a gun. I think you must be imagining things. That's what Constable Hartwell told me when we didn't find the body. What body? I found a body buried in the woods. But when I went back with Hartwell, it was gone. A child's body. He didn't believe me, didn't seem much concerned. Dr. Shaw, what are you trying to imply? Imply? What do you think? I hoped that as an outsider you might be able to help me. As an outsider who has to live here and keep their trust. I more than anyone have to respect the islander's wishes! Wishing? What the, what the hell are these wishes? This island has enough trouble of its own without you coming here and stirring up more! What troubles? Just leave them alone, Dr. Shaw. That's all they want. To be left alone. I don't think I can do that, you know? No Mrs. Straker! No and no! Something has got to be done. Do you think I don't suffer, too? On, I know but... Do you think I'm not with you in your agony? It isn't that. Everyday. Mrs. Straker, everyday I'm faced with it. In my own house. Just as you are. But there are so many of us. So many of us, exactly. So many of us bound together by suffering. I know. I know. Oh, Reverend. What are we going to do? We have to be strong. Strong? The world is all we have. But... Shouldn't we call a doctor? No doctors! What harm could a doctor do? And what good? What do achieve by thwarting the will of the Almighty? We are puny. We are as nothing before him, Mrs. Straker. Never forget that . I know, I know ll... I do, but with a doctor here on the island? We must be on our guard even more. But maybe we should tell him. Maybe that's part of God's plan, sending him here. You think he moves in such trivial, mundane ways? You're a good woman, Mrs. Straker, but... Besides, think of the unhappiness any such action would cause. Think of the worries. And your husband. -Mrs. Straker! Oh. Dr. Shaw. I just wanted to use the phone, if that's alright? The vicar's using is at the moment. It's all, all finished. Have a good day, Mrs. Straker. He seems very much part of the community here. Yes. How long has he been here? Years. Since the war. Yes, I suppose if someone spends a long time in a small community they get a bit set in their ways, don't they? His ways are our ways, Dr. Shaw. Go as he goes, I'm sure he administers to your spiritual needs excellently. How about your more physical needs? How do you mean? Where's the nearest hospital? On the mainland? Oh, we're, we're a healthy lot on Balfe. I'm sure, but what happens if someone falls ill... - Excuse me Dr. Shaw. I have work to do. Uh, another one from the north shore. Oh, Dr. Quist. Yes. John and I have been working those samples Dell sent up from Balfe. Completely new to me. Any sign of damage from the oil or detergent? No, just the opposite. Everything seems just a sight too healthy. And that's bad? I don't know about good or bad, but it's peculiar. It's the plankton clouding the sea water that started it. We did a count of the phytoplankton. That's a plant. Over eight percent up, on average. That's peculiar. Go on. Well... if we averaged out the density of the plankton and the seawater he sent in, it works out at something like three tons to the acre. That's a lot, isn't it? Well, in a year and a good one, you might get five tons to the acre produced. To get three tons to the acre in such a short time, well it's too much. What about the animal plankton? Well, that's up, too. But in a different way. There's not much of it. But all the species are a bit-oversized. Get on to Dell tell him the results and get him to send up some fish from around the island. Are you alright? You be careful. Don't you be long in there. Okay, let's go. Who? Who's there, huh? Oh no! Stop it, you'll kill him! Alright now? Are you Dr. Shaw? Shaw? Dr. Shaw? Are you alright? Are you alright? Uh. Hello. Victoria. How you didn't kill yourself, I don't know. Eh, kill myself? Yes, you were found lying by the beach. Lying on the beach? Yes. What were you doing there? Can you remember? Yes. - I was in the barn.. - You should lie still. Like hell I will. Who found me anyway? Dick Voy, now did he, um he had some lobster pots set by the point. Oh, and Mrs. Straker had a telephone message for you. It was something about fish. Does it make any sense to you? Hmmm. It's beginning to. I'm not mad. There was someone in here last night who attacked me. Hmmmm... Look! Beggar probably left them. You got a lot of beggars in this island? No. Victoria. Listen, will you help me or won't you? I can't do anything that will harm the islanders. Now, why should I want to harm the islanders? I don't know. Well, you might not want to but I don't know what you want to do. First, I want information. There's something wrong on the island, isn't there? Yes. Yes, I think there is. Well, what is it? I don't know. That's the truth. I don't know. Well, some of the people have... Well, they've disappeared. You mean they're dead? No. They just stay in their houses. And the men, they've started fighting with each other. Yes, I saw one in the pub yesterday. It's very difficult to understand what it is. There's just a general air of secretiveness about them. You see, I'm in a very difficult position. I do want to help them. But I don't want to intrude. Will you help me if it doesn't intrude? Yes. Yes, of course I will. What do you need? - I need to catch some fish. - Fish? Kind? I don't understand. Join the club. Is there a fisherman in the island who would help us? Uh, no. No, but I have a friend on the mainland. Bob Gillett. He will. Bob, I think we've got enough now, thank you. Oh, that's ok with me. Is this young halibut or what? No, it's terpit, isn't Bob? That's right, terpit. They never grow to that size! Well, they do 'round here. Oh yes, the fish 'round here are marvelous. Big? Oh enormous! You wouldn't see them like that in London. They're not sent to market then, huh? No they're just sold locally. On Balfre, mainly. What's this? Castle Rock. Prohibited area. Oh, why? Who knows? They don't tell ya, do they? Can we get a bit closer? Sure. What happened here? This isn't where the tanker was sunk. No. No, that was the other side of the island. No, this has been a prohibited area for... eight or nine year now. Really? Oh, we've got the minister on the run this time. And admitting after much arguing that the Royal Navy used the Castle Rock area as a dumping ground up til six years ago. Dumping what? Oh, that they wouldn't say. Interest of national security. Not in the public interest at the present time. - Not the policy of this department. - Listen, they're playing our tune. Oh, what's in the fish? - Have a look a this? - Hm? Four parts per million of what? Well, it's a protein of sorts. It's almost like a pituitary growth hormone. But it's not. The molecules have been mucked about. How the hell could pituitary growth hormone get into fish? Oh, I think you better ask the navy that. Yes? Dr. Shaw, sir. Oh, Dr. Shaw. I've been fold that I should see you. But not why. For the life of me, I can't see how I can help you "Doomsday" people. Let me explain, sir. We've come across some chemically contaminated fish. And we've got a fairly strong idea that they come from a prohibited zone in your area. It's a place called Castle Rock on Balfe. Castle Rock? Oh let's see now that's near Wimbrough, isn't it? Oh, yes, here it is. Castle Rock. But people can't fish there. It's a prohibited area. The place is perfectly well-marked with warning buoys. The fish might feed there and still be caught outside the prohibited area. I just want to find out, sir, exactly what is down there. Oh, alright. Well, sit down. Tavina, will you bring the file? Is that really necessary, sir? What do you mean? I understand from our file well, that you were in charge of the inter-service ordinance team in the area at the time and you were responsible for the dumping yourself. I don't know that I care for your imputation, doctor. I'll 'Uh... just get the file, sir. Alright. Sir Jeffrey. I'm not concerned with past history. I'm only concerned with the effects of this dump on the people of Balfre and on the fish that feed in the area. Alright, but you are on the wrong track. Nothing even remotely dangerous was dumped off Castle Rock. Then why is fishing prohibited there? Not my decision, really. But in any case, what chemical did you find in the fish? It appears to be a hormone similar to pituitary growth hormone. Now I know that you're on the wrong track unless you can make pituitary what-not out of mildly radioactive waste. Only radioactive waste? That's all. Only radioactive waste? That's all. I've been through our file with a fine-tooth comb. It's all about Borden. It says here these casks are corrosion proof for one hundred fifty years. And I'm always inclined to mistrust that sort of claim. I'm ready of it. How much of the fish extract did you give? Well, these two are litter mates. The one on the left had nothing and the other one had a hundred milligrams of the extract inter-muscularly exactly seventy minutes ago. Poor little sod. I wouldn't if I were you. Eh, just a hundred milligrams? How long will it last? I'll give it a sedative in a minute. Shh, shh, c'mon puppy dog, that's enough. Shh, shh. Shh. This dog reminds me of the dog that attacked me in the woods. It's the same violence. Yes, go on. I wonder if this could explain the odd atmosphere on that island. The outbreaks of violence. Hey. Yes. - What happens if you feed people large doses of pituitary hormone? By mouth, nothing. The stomach can't absorb it. You'd have to inject it. Yeah, but this isn't just ordinary pituitary hormone. When the molecules have been mucked around, remember? The sort of thing we've just seen you don't get from any hormone. Yeah, but you see maybe the molecules have been rearranged... to make it digestible. This had the side effect. Yes. I see what you mean. What if adults did somehow absorb pituitary growth hormone? Then you would eventually get... acromegaly. Exactly! I didn't get the connection. I mean, how can you get an epidemic of acromegaly? Acromegaly is only caused by the over functioning of the pituitary gland. So, you can't. Unless the hormone is introduced from outside. But the people on Balfe could have it. That strange look I told you about. The prognathous jaw, though, the hanging brows and its last stages, like the poor bastard who attacked me. Acromegaly. Yeah. Which are due to be just some form of family likeness, you know. Centuries of inbreeding. And we must remember there's no doctor resident on the island who might detect acromegaly. But there isn't any hormone, for god sake. All there is is radioactive waste. That's something we gotta be sure about. John... can you go down and get pictures of the dump? Alright, if you can get another with a camera. Right. You and Dell get back to Balfe and get those pictures. - I'll get a chopper to take us down, right? - Okay. And I'm gonna get on with the minister. Well, there it is. Castle Rock. Make sure you photograph everything. Well, here we go, huh? I just stop. This isn't a minefield, that's all. No sense of adventure, that's your trouble, Bob. Is this the one? Thank you. Ah, Dell, how are you? How'd it go? Couldn't be better. And John didn't drown himself? No such luck. Well, where to next? Our old friend, the Admiral, I think. Don't you? I can't wait. Any luck pinning down exactly what's in those fish? We can't get enough out of them for proper analysis. Could the Navy be dumping vast quantities of hormone off Castle Rock? What for? I can't think what the Navy would want with pituitary growth hormones in the first place. Right. Probably our trip to Portsmouth will provide the answer. I certainly hope so. Anyway, the Admiral was mildly upset by what he described as your ''inuendos.'' Only mildly? I must be losing my grip then. I thought I better come along this time to referee the encounter. You may well be needed. The Admiral's going to have some explaining to do. I hear that I'm mildly unpopular with you, sir. I thought your manner left something to be desired the last time we met, yes. It always lets me down, I'm afraid, but, you see, it's sometimes justified. What are these? Pictures of your underwater dump off Balfe. Castle Rock. Castle Rock is a prohibited area. Who took these? Friend, of mine sir, I'm afraid he was underwater so he didn't see the signs. Yes, these are they. These are ours. And these? What's that? That's what I hope you'll be able to tell us. It's certainly not radioactive waste. You can see better on, on this one. Well, these are nothing to do with the Navy. Well, how do you account for their presence. There's hundreds of the things down there. They must have been dumped after our operation. They're quite unauthorized. What's in them? That's what we gotta find out. There's a number on this canister. Do you think this could be checked somehow? We hope so, sir. There are two things you have to do on the island. Try and find out how many people are affected is the first. And the second is even more difficult. You've got to explain to these people what's been happening to them and then try to restore their morale. That's problematical until we know exactly what we're going to do to be able to help them. Do the best you can. Don't forget you're all they've got at present. ! wonder what he's doing here. Oh, I was just coming to see you, Vicar. Oh? Yes, I wonder if you can help me? - In what way? - Well, I want to get the islanders together for a meeting. All the islanders. I thought the church would be a convenient and appropriate place. Indeed, I hope that you will talk to them yourself. Talk? About what? Well, to put it bluntly, there are a lot of people on this island suffering from a disease called ?acromegaly.? Disease? Yes, it's a disease caused by exposure to a hormone. - I doubt that doctor. - What do you mean? The islanders here, you know, they've lived a closed life for centuries. Life of inbreeding, and immorality. Yes, yeah that first crossed my mind, but we now have definite proof of this disease. Perhaps you would enlighten me, Doctor. How is this disease contracted? We think its probably caused by eating fish contaminated by the hormone. I see... And how do you account for the fact that the disease is so selective? Striking one person and not his neighbor. One man and not his brother. Probably because one man eats more fish than another. That explanation satisfies you, does it? Yes, it's the only reasonable one. Ah. The voice of science. I'm afraid we have nothing more to say to each other. Good day, Doctor. I always wish you were right, you know? Well? You've really put the cat among the pigeons this time. What's happening? Well, after the request for information you sent out... everybody's been making spot-checks on their fish... and found it packed full of the stuff. And these are where the reports have come from? Yes. Apparently the French have protested to the British government. Oh, that's standard. And the Minister has been trying to reach you all day. John spoke to him. And? There should be no right to divulge such information to a foreign power. What an opportunist, the man is. I didn't divulge anything anyway. I merely asked for information. Well, the good news is we have traced the index marking on the canisters. And they come from Doran Chemicals. Doran? Eh, Doran Chemicals Limited, Chairman Sir Henry Leyton. Triflimide? A well educated nose, Dr. Ridge. Well, I'll just get Sir Henry for you. Sir Henry, there's a Dr. Ridge from Doomwatch to see you. Well, well, well, Dr. Ridge. Good morning. Morning. How's my old friend, Quist? I'm sorry I didn't know you knew each other. Oh, I expect ?friend? is 100 strong a word. We were at Oxford together. Mad bugger, he was, like all mathematicians. Well, what can I do for ya? Well, uh... - I'm not in trouble with you fellas, I trust. - Oh no, I don't think so. - Thank heavens for that. The amount we spent on anti-pollution procedures... Just making some general inquiries into hormone production. I know you make a lot of them. Oh yes, any amount. Thyroxine, adrenalin, estrogen, progesterone. What about pituitary growth hormone? As you can see, we've always geared ourselves to bulk production. We leave it to the small specialist firms... to turn out the stuff that can only be produced a milligram at a time. We'd heard rumors that you'd found a way of producing it in very large quantities, indeed. Oh, you should never listen to rumors Dr. Ridge. I never do. Make it a rule. - Don't I, David? - Absolutely, Sir Henry. Well, let's go inside. If you'll take a look at these. What are these? They're your canisters, Sir Henry. - Is this ours, David? - The serial numbers have been traced to you. Oh, putting out your trust in serial numbers, Dr. Ridge. Look, check on these canisters, will you David? There's obviously been a cock-up somewhere. Um, come and have a look at the model. Now, look Sir Henry... Can we stop playing games? - Oh, now, there... - These canisters are yours. They've been dumped in the sea. And something very like pituitary growth hormone is escaping from them. That shouldn't do much harm. Neutralize with the sea water in a couple of hours. Old Mother Nature has a way of dealing with these things, Dr. Ridge. That's what you...you doom and disaster fellas oughta realize. Unfortunately, Old Mother Nature's been nobbled in this case, as you well know. This stuff's been specially prepared. Probably to be taken orally. The local fish are cram full of it. Now, why should anyone do that? I can think of a number of reasons. Livestock feed additive is the first thing that springs to mind. Oh, you're too cute for us, Dr. Ridge, you really are. Yes, indeed we did experiment with and for a time produce... a pituitary growth hormone for the very purpose you describe. Livestock feed additive. And? In small quantities, we could do it. It was very exciting. Added to the feed of bullocks, it increased their growth rate by thirty percent. In their first year of life. Oh, God. Kind. Hi, David. Well, you can speak freely. I'm quite sure Dr. Ridge is one of these, uh... industrial spies that we read so much about. Well, sir, the canister were RPGH. And who dumped it. Our usual people? Uh, no. As a matter of fact, as it was an important operation, we put it out to tender. And you gave the job to the lowest bidder. They were a reputable firm. Until they were found out. They gave you a low bid because they were going to dump it in their own backyard. What went wrong with the stuff? We don't really know. But for some reason, whenever we tried to produce it in bulk... the molecular structure broke up. It was still ingestible, but after a period of months... the animals were in a pitiable state. Quite uncontrollable. The seem to produce another kind of... kind of frenzy. Let me through! Let me through! I'm a doctor! Please, let me through. Get away! Get away from him! Hey, you get away! - Go away, leave us alone. - There's nothing you can do, Doctor. - You go. Go. - Now come out of there! C'mon now. There's nothing you can do, Doctor. It's old Mr. Murray. He's dead. Stand back. Go get a blanket now. Put it over him. Alright now, that's enough of what you've done. C'mon now. Get moving now! Get off the street. C'mon now, or I'll punch your ears. It's a certainly an attempt at pituitary growth hormone. We know that much. But is there any way we can neutralize it, in the sea, preferably. We can't tell that until we can get hold of some of the stuff. Hold? We have their original formula, but they could never work out what it was that always went wrong. So can they give us some of the stuff itself? No. They just dropped it like a hot brick. They've got none of it left. The only hope is at this disposal firm... Kestin... will have some. If they have, stop them dumping it, and commandeer some for us. They're on the mainland, just opposite Balfe. At Wimbra. Oh, by God, they didn't put themselves out with this dumping, did they, eh? Exactly. Okay, okay I'll get down there. If they've got any of the hormone left I get it down to you, alright? - Call me. - Alright, bye. Morning, Vicar. Hi Dr. Shaw. I need your help. Yes, Vicar, I needed yours yesterday. What is it? I know. I'm sorry. You don't understand. Please come. It's my daughter. Please. Alright. How is she? She'll be alright. And the baby? The baby's dead. Where's the father? He's not well, he... He can't be seen. Then you'd better come in, then. I gave her a sedative. She'll sleep for six or seven hours. Come over here. Yes, yes. Hey, did you get around to everybody about the meeting tonight? Yes, I've asked them, but I don't think they'll come. Didn't you explain to them? No. I thought I gave that to you. What are they all afraid of, for god sakes. Well, some of them feel it's a result of inbreeding. And the rest... They feel it's some kind of judgment. Give me that old time religion. Well, whatever it is, they're ashamed of it. Yes, that's right enough. This disease they've got... Can you cure them? Can you? To be honest with you... I don't know. I don't know because it may be different from the ordinary acromegaly that we find in clinics. I'm sure we can arrest it. I'm sure of it. But what about the others? Can't you reverse the effect it's already had? Well, I don't know. How bad are they? You've seen as much as I have. You mean they"re just to their beds and haven't been seen since? Well, they kept to their houses or their families kept them there. For all I know they may be dead. Two of them are anyway. Two? Old Mr. Murray and the disappearing body in the woods. Yes, that's fine. Thank you. Quite, sir. - Ah, Dr. Quist, good morning. - Morning, Admiral. Left your young Prentice at home today, I see. Oh, I'm allowed out on my own from time to time. Eh, sit down. An, then, what can I do for you? Quite a lot, I hope. We found out who's been trespassing on your dump at Castle Rock. Oh, good, who? Some tin pop disposal firm. Kestin Disposals, they call themselves, from near Wimbra. And. We now have to get the stuff they dumped, uh, up again. We? I don't know of anyone else with appropriate ships and equipment. Yes, but I'm not at all convinced that the Navy should clean up a civilian's mess. Well, surely in essence, that's what the Navy always has to do. In matters of defense, of course. But I don't think that this is {he same thing, at all. On the contrary. Defense of the realm would cover it all too well. - Hey, you got foo many over that side! - Right! Right! Keep them in the bow! Bridle, back. C'mon! Bridle back. Can you see anything? Nothing like the ones we want. Let's find out who's in charge here. Who are you? Who's in charge here? Who wants to know? Dr. Shaw wants to know! Oh. I wonder who he is? I think he's the public relations officer. He's comin'. He's expecting ya. Well, I hope so. Mr. Brewer's up there. I got a call from Doran saying to expect you. - How do you do? - How do you do? What can I do for you? Yes, I wonder if you've got any of the, uh, PGH left? Any left? Ha ha, I gotta a whole boat load. C'mon, follow me. Can I take one of these? Sure. Mr. Broom said I was to offer you every facility. I've got another two hundred in the hold you can save me the trouble of dumping if you like. One'll do, thanks. And you're not dumping these. What do you mean? You're in enough trouble, already. Trouble? I'm in no trouble. You bloody well are! For dumping this stuff in a prohibited area. You can't prove it. I've got photographs of the dump, man. Anyway, why not? Where's the harm in it? If the Navy can use the place for a dump, why can't I? Do you know what's down there? They scuttled a ship there, I'd heard. You heard wrong. It was radioactive waste. So. if you go ahead and dump this lot, you'll be out of business so quick your feet won't touch the ground. Now wait a minute! There's no ship down there! It's radioactive waste! The radiation has produced gas in your canisters... and now they're bursting open like shelling peas! C'mon, Victoria, get out. Old Mr. Murray. I'm going in for a drink and I'm going to try and drum up some support for this meeting. Good luck. Are you coming with me? No, I think I'll...get the school room ready for the meeting. - I'll see you later. - Right. Hello, Del? Hello, any news? We're all organized now. We can have a medical team on Balfe right away. Look... can you hold it, just until tonight? I said we're ready. I know. I know, I know. I've called a meeting of the whole village. What for? Well, I want to explain everything to them, just give them a chance to take it in. It'll make very little difference, a matter of hours. I'll phone you immediately after the meeting, okay? Alright, then. But, that's the latest. I'll wait for your call. Good luck. Thanks. Don't come no closer. Why not? I'm... I'm going ugly. What do you want? I don't know why. I wanna talk to you. I'm the one who's been following you since you come. Because you want to talk to me? No, I was told to. To see what you were doing. Well... What do ya want to talk to me about? I don't know. I just don't wanna go like me grandfather. What, uh, happened to him then? He went ugly, too. Worse than me. But he went bad in the head, too. And I don't want that. I shouldn't really tell you this, but it don't matter now, because he's dead. He killed my little sister, he went so bad. He had terrible rages like a mad animal. That's why we had to hide him out in the barn. Oh, that was him, was it? Aye, til you found him. So we had to bring him back. But he died anyway. You see, he jumped out the window. Your name's Murray, isn't it? That's right. Brian Murray. That was his name, too. He handed me his name and... this. Will you trust me, Brian? I don't know. I must do, mustn't 1? Or want to, at least. Will you come to the meeting at the school house with me? What for? Well, I want to talk to the people about what's wrong with them. If I had you with me it might help me. And them too, I know. Okay. I'm sorry there aren't more of you. Now you all know Brian Murray. You don't really know me. My name is Dell Shaw and I'm a doctor. And when you look at Brian... You all, I'm sure, see certain characteristics that have become familiar to you. The overhanging brown, the broadening of the nose and lips. I haven't looked at Brian's teeth... but I'd be willing to bet that the lower teeth are separating... because of the abnormal growth of the jawbone. Can I look, Brian? Yes, you see. And will you notice the hands. The thick, spectra fingers. Now, I want to make this quite clear... this is not due to inbreeding. This is not an inherited condition passed on through families. This not even, as I've heard it suggested a ?divine judgment.? This disease has been well known to doctors for a long time. It is called acromegaly. And it is usually caused by too much of a certain hormone... being produced by a gland at the base of the brain called... the pituitary gland. In this case, however... it is being caused by the hormone getting in from the outside and it's... now probably, we think probably, in the fish that you eat. Now, I know that you've been ashamed of this disease because you didn't know what it was. You can feel it, and you also can feel crimes committed by the victims of the disease. Now, the violence behind them was triggered off by the same material. And now is the time to come out in the open! There is nothing whatever shameful in this disease and it can be cured! I'm going to telephone the mainland for medical help. And I want you... to persuade all the people you think are suffering from this disease... to come forward for examination and treatment. You say it can be cured. Yes! How? Well, one way is to treat the pituitary gland with x-rays.. Will they do that here? On the island, you mean? No, it'll probably have to be done on the mainland. Please! Please, just listen a moment. It's the only way... I promise you. This is the only way. There isn't any other. And how long's it going to take? Well, I don't know. Well... A week? No... A month? No, it's a long job. That's all very well. But, how how long then? A year? Yes, it could be. It depends how far the disease has developed. Do you realize how many of us, uh, have got this disease? - No, [ don't know. - More than half the island. More like three quarters. There won't be any village left. If you don't do something here... Listen, please! No, you listen! You wanna kill the island! Its all untraceable! If you don't do something... If, if they don't get treatment... You're an outsider and you're tryin' tell us what to do? You'll kill the whole island, that's what you'll do! Listen, please! - Listen! - Del. Del... It's no good. Please! Listen to me! Del. It's no good. Alright, c'mon. You've got to listen to us. You won't listen and you won't answer for my...-I'm sorry... - I'm sorry. - I want answers from you! I'm sorry. Hopeless. Hopeless. I better phone Quist now. What do you want? Could we use the phone, Mrs. Straker? - It's very late. - Please. Mrs. Straker, it's very urgent. I'll turn up the lamp. Thank you. Operator. Hello, I want to make a call to London, please. Yes, it's a personal call to Dr. Quist. Q-u-i... s-t. Oh, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon! I'm trying to connect you, sir. Del. What? The back door. Get out the front way. Quick. Are you there, caller? What's he doing? He's go the telephone! Put it down. Put it down! Hold the line, please. I'm trying to connect you. You are not going to destroy this island, Dr. Shaw. Our families... have lived here for hundreds of year. Perhaps that's not a good thing. It is our life. Without this island... we would have no life. We'd all be scattered. We don't want to harm you... but we will... if we have to defend our island. I'm sorry, but... I'm very sorry, but your community is already damaged. It's perhaps beyond repair. I don't want to destroy it, I want to try and save it. You, yourselves, are damaged, too, and I want to try and help you. There's no reasonable alternative. If you're not treated you'll get worse. You'll all go blind, you'll all die before your time. Your island community will certainly die. Medical help, I can bring... is your only hope. I'm going to telephone the mainland, now, to get help. We'll kill if we have to. Make no mistake about that! Operator. Hello? -Hello? That number's ... -Hello! I want to make a call to London, please. London. Just hold the line a moment, sir. Caller, can you hear me? Hello? Hello, caller? Number, please. Hello? Hello. Get me Doomwatch in London, please. Women and children down to the life boats, please. Let the stretcher through. Anybody in need of immediate medical attention go to the Red Cross tent. Don't panic. Don't panic. Here, children, c'mon. So, you heard the marlin, take the luggage for them. Make sure they're safe. I'll see you tonight on the mainland. I promise. Are they all going? Yes. Every family has at least one affected. Some of them have got two. This island will be in ruins in two years.
