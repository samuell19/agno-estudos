Ten years ago, my team developed this technology for people just like him. People left to die. People everyone gave up on. The question now is: Can we wake them up?

I know how devastating it is to lose someone you love. But I am glad that you finally decided to come in. I know it’s frustrating seeing so many doctors. Right. And-and do you think this will help with my amnesia? Well, your head seems to have healed nicely. You shouldn’t have even survived this. -(flipping through papers) -(sighs) Let’s see. You have done the EMDR. Hmm. Neurological feedback, cognitive therapy. All of this is good, but what we do here goes deeper. What is it... what is it that you do here?

And in the years that I’ve been doing this, nobody ever sees anything. Until after multiple sessions, maybe, but you... (sighs) The fact that you could see something that fast?

Who else will? BROOKS: Are you familiar with the term "life review"? No. It’s a phenomenon reported by many after a near-death experience, where your life flashes before your eyes. I believe that that flash contains key memories that replay on a constant loop all the time. Uh-huh. So, putting you directly into those memories is the focus of this therapy. I’m sorry, put, uh... Wh-What do you mean, put me in those memories? (chuckles) Come with me, please. We call this headset the Black Box. First, I put you under hypnosis to open up your subconscious. And this EEG will read your brain waves and send them to a processor inside here. This processor will extract those key memories from your brain waves and convert each memory into an immersive virtual experience. Okay, like-like a hologram? More like a dream, like walking in your own shoes. It’ll feel real. The goal... is to put you into as many of those key memories as possible -until you wake up. -(typing) NOLAN: Okay, uh, h-how long will it be before I see results? Well, depends on how you respond to the therapy. Maybe a few weeks. Okay. I don’t have a few weeks. I need to be able to take care of my daughter.

(steady beeping) Transferring directly into and out of the trance stage can be pretty jarring, so I like to begin with something I call the safe room. Imagine it as your core, a place where you are completely comfortable, where nothing can harm you. A secret place that only you can enter. -You got it? -Got it. Good. We’re ready to begin the session. I’ll count you in. Relax. Look forward. And you should see a cursor. Uh-huh. I do. When the cursor moves, focus on its movement. Let it relax you. (whirring) BROOKS: There’s nothing now. No lab. No room. No chair. Only the sound of my voice and the cursor. Pay attention to your feet, your legs, your arms. They’re getting heavier-- too heavy. But it feels good. Let that feeling wash over your entire body. The closer the cursor gets, the deeper you go. The deeper you go, the better you will feel. The better you feel, the deeper you will go. In ten seconds, you’ll be in your safe room. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. (static crackling) Nolan, are you in your safe room? You’re gonna have to guide me. I can’t see anything. (sighs) -(panting) -You hear me? Uh... Yes. Yes, I can. Good. Now, remember, nothing can harm you here. But do not go out the door. I can only count you out from inside this room. You hear me? I need you to understand this. I will not be able to bring you back if you leave, okay? -Understood. -Good. So, now I want you to imagine an analog watch. And when you do, it should appear in the room with you. (watch ticking) (Nolan gasps softly) From this room, you’re going to go deeper into your subconscious. Beyond this point, we will not be able to communicate anymore. When you push the crown of the watch, you will be in one of your memories. Focus on it. Concentrate. Let it come back to you. Whenever you like, you can turn the crown to another memory. Forward for the next, backward for the previous one. If at any time you feel uncomfortable, push the crown in, and you’ll be back here. Nolan, do you understand? Uh... (chuckles) (panting): Uh, understood. Understood. Good. Are you ready? Yes. Yes, I am. Then push the crown in and remember.

The same thing that you saw during hypnosis? -What did it look like? -I-I don’t know, but it-it... I guess it looked like a person, but it-it didn’t move like one. I see. I think most likely that’s your brain trying to protect you from your trauma. It’s trying to keep you from remembering. You just have to remember that that thing is not real. Next time, we’ll stay a little longer. At least one face should appear. Longer? That’s why you’ve been sick for so long. If you can avoid it, I think we could overcome this. Listen, I know this sounds very strange, especially after having seen so many other doctors, but I mean it-- you are doing well.
