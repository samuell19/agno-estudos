- Dr. Masters? - Yes, I'm Masters. Welcome to Manaus. I'm Adhemar Silva. Well, it was nice of you to meet me. Here let me take this. Heavy. It was freezing in New York. I almost didn't take off on account of a blizzard. After the usual formalities you can change into your tropicals and get outside, have an ice drink. Ice. I should have brought along that blizzard. This way please. Dr. Pete Masters, New York, Institute of Archeology. I've read in the papers about you, Doctor. Sir Silva reserved the best room in the house for you. That's fine. Uh, would you exchange this for me- - Oh. - Please. Sure. One, two. This way, please. - Thank you. Hello. Okay. There's no Crespi. No harm done, no harm done. I just wanted to see what room Dr. Masters is in. You've been told many times not to annoy our guests. Who's annoying who? I have a right to see anybody I like. Will you kindly oblige me by leaving? This is a public place, you can't throw me out of here. We've had much trouble with you, sir. Please tell Dr. Masters I must speak to him. No, I won't. And will you please leave now? Be dark in a few moments. Night falls quickly at the equator. It'll just take me a second and then we can go. Go where? Well, the museum. I'm dying to see Peter Martyr's script. I can hardly wait. You can't wait? Doctor, you better get that Yankee impatience out of your system. It doesn't go well with the climate here. Maybe so, but, uh, I'm curious. Look, tomorrow's another day, take a rest. I'm not tired. I'll be back in couple of hours, then we can go out to dinner. While in Rome do as the Romans do. See ya later. Yeah, sure. I'll be back shortly. Shall I call a taxi, sir? No, thanks, I'll walk. Follow me, Dr. Masters. Hmm? Wait just a minute, you were speaking to me? Yes, I must speak to you. It's of great importance for you. For me? Do I know you? Dr. Crespi at your service. What would you say, Doctor, if we imbibed a cool drink over there? I wouldn't take but a few minutes of your time. - Well, I don't know, I- - It's perfectly safe. This is a street, an open thoroughfare, you can sit with me without being in danger. All right. Is this all right, Doctor? It's fine. And what is your pleasure? Well, I- Mine is gin over ice. The only drink that agrees with my liver. Here. Two double gins. Oh, I don't care for anything. Two gins, double. I am certainly glad you finally got to Manaus. I don't understand why. How did you know I was here? It was in the papers. Dr. Peter Masters, the famous archeologist from New York will arrive in Manaus to study the Peter Martyr edition, and here you are. I still don't understand, mister, uh- - Crespi. - Crespi. What you want from me? I can put into your lap the most extraordinary archeological discovery of the century. Well, tell me what is this, uh, extraordinary discovery? Ever wonder about this river, Doctor? The Amazon? Yes, the Amazon, thousands of miles long, unknown most of it. The last virgin territory in the world. Ever wonder why it's called the Amazon? There's a myth, a legend about a tribe of women warriors. Is that what you wanted me to say? When Pizarro conquered Peru his captain Francisco de Orellana traveled down the river, and found a tribe of fighting women. He call it Amazon after those girls. Well, that's the legend that's recorded in Peter Martyr's book. You know what martyr means in Greek, Doctor? It means witness. And you're looking at a witness, me. You've seen them? The Amazons? See, I live with them. Live with them! Tall, beautiful girls built like females. I can see that you don't care much for women. In their place, Doctor, in their place. Every hear of Queen Conori? Queen Conori? No. It's Omagua. It means I love you. You speak Omagua, the lost language? That would be the archeological discovery of the modern age. I know a few words. That's why I want to take you there, Doctor. You're built of the right stuff, the stuff they like. Tall, fair, Nordic, that's what they fancy. Sounds like fun. You wouldn't believe it, Doctor, but I was like you in my salad days. I say it still sounds like fun. Ah, it's heaven. And besides the women, diamonds are as common as pebbles. And the sand are made of gold nuggets. You'll come back a rich man. Tell me why didn't you ever go back? I need financing. That's where you come in. It takes money to get a boat to help you up the river into another country. You can't do it alone. For 35 years I've tried to interest people like you. They think I'm crazy, but I have proof. Proof? Yes, for $5,000 I'll show you. $5,000, that's all I need to get started. Well, while you're at it you might as well make it a million. I'm afraid I'm not that rich. But you can get it, the Institute of Archeology. Sorry, Mr. Crespi. Oh, you fool. Are you blind like the others? Can't you see luck when it's handed to you on a gold platter? It's been nice talking to you, Mr. Crespi. Oh, no, no, no, please, I can pay. I can pay. Allow me. Your story's been worth a couple of drinks. I'm not lying, Doctor. I'll prove it to you tomorrow. All right, Mr. Crespi. I'll be greatly interested. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Those were the golden days. Manaus was Paris, New York, Rio rolled in one. Money was no object. The opera house had been up just a couple of years. Everybody was getting rich. Rubber was better than gold. Then the bubble burst and Manaus became the sleeping beauty of the fairy tale. Now the oil boom is waking her up like the prince in the story. Just a few more pages and I'll be through. That was the time almost 35 years ago, when Crespi came back from far up the river with that story about Amazon women. He's been telling it every since. Always trying to get financing for a trip back up the river to where pebbles are gold, and rocks diamonds. Where is this place? Well, according to him, it's in one of the Guyanas. The most unknown part of that ocean of trees and plants. Well, people have been there haven't they? Yes, but no one has ever come back from that region of the Amazon. About four years ago a friend of mine and a group of five people, including a young lady disappeared. A young lady? Yes, Gina Vanni. She was botanist. Hmm. But Crespi came back. I'm beginning to think his story's lifted right out of Greek mythology. Yes, he lives with it. He's been telling it every since. People pay him to, uh, tell his tale, huh? Well, foreigners slip him a few cruzeiros. He hangs around the airport like it was when you came in. The name of the queen is always Conori. You know Crespi was always talking about the Amazon queen, her name was Conori. Crespi read every book about the river and its history. He's built a pretty good story through the years. I thought I could tell when a man was telling the truth or not. He almost convinced me. By now he believes his own story. I didn't hear you knock, Crespi. Would it change your opinion about me had I knocked? Oh, I don't mind insults, Doctor, I'm used to them. I just look at the man who says it, condemns him not me. I didn't mean to insult you. She hasn't seen another man but me since she left home. She's only looked at me for the last 35 years. Who is she? Queen Conori. Queen Conori? In there? I said, I'd bring you proof. Now tell Silva to get out of here. I'm afraid I can't do that, this happens to be his office. Then come to my place. That's enough, Crespi. Either show us what you have there or get out. All right, let's get back to our work. All right. Look at her. Maybe she'll forgive me. Her eyes wide apart. A high forehead. That mouth that can kiss, but her mind was as hard as the gold she's made of. Gold. Want to hold her? She likes men. Tall, strong men. Pre-Columbian. No, no, not quite. No, not exactly. No, there's something Renaissance about it. Don't touch it! The winged serpent on her head. She's an Inca goddess. Unbelievable. I've never seen such a piece in my life. She must weigh three pounds. 24 karat. Gold is cheaper up there than beans down here. I told you, Doctor. You believe me now? Where'd you get her? For 35 years I'm telling my story and he wants to hear it again. Come on, Crespi, this is a chance for you to tell the truth. The truth? And who would believe the truth? Crespi! Here it is down here. Cachaca. Cheap rum. Mr. Crespi. Mr. Crespi. - Oh, watch out! Put that thing down, Crespi. It's me, Pete Masters. Don't ever wake me up like that. I might have thrown this thing at you. What are you doing here? There's something I wanted to show you. A cable. What is it? Who would send me a cable? I can't read, I have no glasses. It just says, "That the Institute of Archeology agrees to finance our expedition into the interior." - The expedition? - That's what you wanted, wasn't it? - You mean- - The Manaus Museum is also part of this undertaking. We want you to join us. To show us the way. Through the Amazons? What's your angle? The gold that you're bringing back? The diamonds? You wouldn't do it for nothing would you? Our museum would like to buy that small statue you showed us. And if you bring back more of those relics then of course we want first choice to purchase. First choice, that's fair enough. But my queen is not for sale. She'd be in good hands. It's in the best hands now. Don't you think it's foolish to hide her here where she can be stolen or lost? You didn't come here to finance my expedition! You came here to steal my queen! Now get out of here both of you! I'd like for you to take me to the interior, Mr. Crespi. I'll be glad to pay you for it. You know I can't do it without you. You wouldn't know where to go. Nobody knows where to go but me. All right, then indicate the route, and I'll order the boat, and provisions, and hire the men. Oh, no, I do my own hiring. And you are staying behind. Since our money's involved we will furnish this expedition. You'll be hired and paid. Dr. Masters will be in charge, not you. Now if you don't agree we can stop this conversation right now. I'm running my own show. You're not dealing with, with children, Crespi. I'd never trust you with human lives. Come on, Dr. Masters, let's go. I'm sorry, Mr. Crespi. All right. I'll do it your way. Anything you say. That's sensible. All right, that's good. Let's get started right away. Right away? 35 years too late. Fernando. Crespi. Yes, we better speaking English, senor Crespi. Then the people won't overhear us. What do you want? Me, my brother, and my friends, a job on your boat, senor. I've got all the men I need. All the men but not all the friends, Senor Crespi. I can't use you. You go to a place where there is gold for all of us! Why not share it with friends? The Americano hired me for an expedition. We heard your story about the gold, the women, and the diamonds, senor. The story must be true or the Americano wouldn't be going. Now get out of here both of you or I'll call the police! You are not our friend, Senor Crespi. You will regret your decision, senor. You haven't seen the last of us yet. Mr. Crespi. On the nose Dr. Masters. We are ready to push off. I'm sorry I couldn't get here earlier to help you. Let Crespi handle the details. You give the orders, Crespi does the rest. Will you follow me, please? Follow me, gentlemen. Step into my salon. This way, this way please. Sit down, sit down. Let me pour you a drink. This is real stuff. This is not cachaca. I've brought along a government map here, Mr. Crespi, and I was wondering if you'd indicate the route? Anything the skipper says. I'm just the first mate, that's me. Thank you. Well, here's to luck and money. Well, here's where we are now, right here. Yes, and we go upstream into Rio Blanco. From there into Rio Engano. - Rio Engano? - Hmm-hmm. River of deceit. River of deceit? What a strange name for a river. Not so strange when you sail it. All of the sudden water runs out from under you and you're sitting on mud. I've heard of that, Doctor. Those rivers have amazing high and low tides. From here we go inland in this direction, out of Brazil into Guyana. You amaze me, Crespi. Who would remember those rivers so well as to find his way in that undergrowth? There is a landmark. A rock covered with Indian symbols. People with two heads, animals with eight feet. Oh, you'll get a kick out of that. Where do we go from there? From there on only Crespi knows. You won't find a human soul around there. The Indians have gone, leaving the land to the Amazons. They used to raid 'em, steal their men, and all their male children. You certainly know your mythology. They didn't burn their right breast like the Greek Amazons to make room for the bow. Oh, they're a tough lot, but I can handle it. We'll come back with a boat load of diamonds, and gold, and a couple of Amazons for your museum, Senor Silva. I wish I didn't have this malaria, and I was 10 years younger. Oh, maybe you're lucky. I'll probably get back and I'll have malaria, and uh, be 10 years older. This is unknown territory. No guessing what's waiting for us here. Beautiful women and diamonds, that's what's there. Well, I'd better be going if I'm to make Manaus before nightfall. Good luck, Doctor. Adios. - Adios, Senor Silva. I'll see you out. Hardest thing to get in Brazil a gun. In the States you go in the shop and buy one. Here, permissions, questionnaires, restrictions, and then they charge you an outrageous price. They don't seem like such bad restrictions. All you need out here anyway is a machete. A man has got to defend himself. Against what? We might run into Indians that never seen animals like us before. The knife wouldn't be much good anyway, would it? There's that boat again. Seems to be trailing us. I've had my eyes on them for hours. Well, why would they wanna follow us? I don't like this. They're not fishermen, who are they? Fernando and Carlos. You know them? Uh-huh, they're no good. We're in for trouble, Doctor. What does he say? He says, "To heave to." Pirates in these days. Who are they? This is Rio Engano, the tide will catch up with us. They know that. Well, let's stay in deep water as long as possible. What do they want? Our boat. They can't get much further up the river with that old tug. Tell them we're not talking on any passengers. We're running aground. It's the tide. In a few minutes we'll be sitting in mud. Crespi. We don't want to fight with you, Dr. Masters. We got 30 men here, you have only eight. Everybody in this country seems to know my name. When we sailed from Manaus everybody knew about us. What do you want? Your boat, Doc. That's piracy, you can hang for that. We never hang people over here like in your country, Dr. Masters. And they haven't caught us yet. Let me come aboard and talk things over. Just try it. I know Senor Crespi for years. He'll tell you that we don't mean to harm you. Don't believe him. He's a jailbird and a killer. Hold it. If you get rid of Fernando you get rid of all of them. No, no shooting. Get back you! Crespi. Back to your mud bath, Fernando. Oh, no you don't, Fernando. You too. Lie, lie still. You got a nasty crack. Give me some water. You've got a fever. Don't drink too fast or too much, huh. We're moving? Yeah, the tide's back in. This is our boat. Yeah, but Fernando's our new skipper. What happened to our boys? Left with the other boat some of them. What do you mean some of them? Was quite a fight. When those boys get going they get going good. I'm gonna go see Fernando. No, no, no, no. The main thing is are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Just go get Fernando. All right, you stay put, will you? Nice gun. Must have cost a fortune. Dr. Masters wants to see you, Fernando. Why doesn't he come to see us? He's sick, he's got a fever. People who sail the river get the fever all the time. Tell him to come up. If you had a little brains left, Fernando, you'd let the doctor and myself go. The doctor's an important man. The police won't stop looking until they find him and you. I don't wish you harm, senor. But I can't do that yet. First you have to show us the way to the gold, and diamond, and beautiful women. Not a chance. You will. There are many ways of persuasion, senor. Better get back to your bunk, Doctor. I wondered if you'd honor us. How do you feel, Doctor? What's on your mind, Fernando? If your amigo Crespi hadn't hit you so hard you'd be feeling better. What? He's crazy. Don't you know that Senor Crespi hired us to attack your boat. Why they're lying. Why would I? A clever man should be able to figure why. What's he talking about? Senor Crespi wanted us to sail up the river, but he doesn't want Mr. Silva man to know where he's going. What are you trying to do to me? He wants no witnesses, so they got rid of your people, Doc, by hiring us. Is this true, Crespi? What? It is obvious isn't, Doctor? Rob the boat and equipment. He wants us to take him upstream, and put him and you ashore. He doesn't want us along to see the way of the women, the gold, and the diamonds. Jump, doctor. I should have let you drown. Not a word of what he said is true. Not a word. Come on. You wanna go on living don't you? Hey. Doctor. Hmm. Here, Doctor. Chew this. What is it? It'll kill that fever. Chew it good. It's bitter. Aw, it's all right. It'll go away. Sometimes I have it so bad I can't even hold a bottle. Try to sleep a little. Now I'm getting cold. I wish we had a fire. How do we get back? Don't worry, we are close now. Close? Close to what? Close to a certain rock with Indian paintings on it. That's where the Amazon territory starts. It's somewhere around here, and I'm going to find it. You'll be all right, it's only the fever. Stay where you are. Don't move. I'll be right back. Here. Crespi? Crespi? Crespi! Crespi? Crespi? Crespi? Good morning, ladies. I've seen white ladies, red ones, blue. I've never seen any green ladies before. Of course none of you is actually real. I thought was Queen of the May. Feeling better? Huh? Can you drink some of this? Yeah. Here, now drink. Slowly. That's it. You're getting better. It's bitter. Did you just speak English to me or am I crazy? I did. And I hope you're not. Yeah, you're real all right. Of course. Uh, no, thank you. I don't care for anymore. What is it? - An herb. - Oh. Now drink the rest of it. No, I don't really wanna. I. Ugh. Hey, where am I? Where's Crespi? What happened? Who are you? My name is Gina. Gina Vanni. Gina Vanni. That name sounds familiar. I, yeah, I remember. You're the girl that was on that expedition. Got lost four years ago. You're supposed to be dead. But you're not are you? What's that? Who are they? What are they doing? Who are those creeps? Amazons. Hey, now, now wait a minute. Don't leave me here with them. Oh, no, no, wait, no, no, no, wait, wait! Take it easy. Oh, ladies. Oh, you weigh a ton, mother. Oh, oh. Oh, my goodness. What are you trying to do to me? I'm a visitor, I'm a visitor here. Now wait a minute. Don't take off my shirt will ya? It's the only shirt I have. No, not the pants. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Now ladies, please, I don't need a bath, I went swimming yesterday afternoon. You don't have to give me a bath. Oh. Oh, now, ladies, please, I don't need a bath. Honest I don't. Please, please, ladies. Oh. Oh. Oh, please, ladies. Gina, help! They're boiling me in oil! Watch out, ladies! Get out of here! Please, I don't need a bath! Please. One at a time! Oh, no, oh! That's enough. That's enough! That's enough, that's enough! That's enough! Boy, oh, boy. If you could understand, I'd tell you a thing or two, and I'd wipe those smiles off your faces. Tell me I will translate. Oh, please, tell 'em to get out of here, will ya? They haven't seen a young man for a long time. That's obvious. And besides you needed a bath. Huh? Here you can put these on. Where are you going? Oh, wait a minute. Gina, Gina, wait a minute! Uh-oh, here comes the first team. Ah. Now look, ladies. Now come on, take it easy. Now there's not enough of me to go around. Oh, come on, now, now wait a minute! 16th century. 1532 to be exact. Who are you? Francisco Pizarro attacked the Inca’s in 1532 with weapons like this. His captain Orellana brought them down the river. There isn't finer specimen in the Prado Museum. As for the statue, it's pure gold, 24 karats. No museum in the world possesses one more beautiful. It's kept me alive just to hold it in my hands. Who are you? I'm Pete Masters. Masters? Yes, I'm an archeologist. Archeologist? Huh, so am I. It seems the Amazons are found of archeologists or else archeologists are the only people insane enough to enter into their territory. I'm, I'm Mario Dellamano. Oh, yes, yes, Silva told me about you. Silva? Yeah, Silva. He's the curator of the Manaus Museum. You led the expedition that disappeared four years ago. I'm sorry, it's so long ago. My memory. You the only man around here? Yes. I suppose now you'll take my place. I don't know what you mean. I look after the weapons here. Clean them, keep the rust off, fire all the arquebuses. Terrific velocity. These arrows can pierce a man. It's no use. You don't make sense. You wanted to kill me right now, why? So that I may live. One man is a commodity. Two is a threat to their security. They'd never let two of us live. Come. My children. My daughters. I had sons too, you know. But they were all killed at birth. Murdered by their mothers. Their mothers? In a society like this, Dr. Masters, predicated entirely on women, women are kept like bees keep drones. Look at the little savages. Future murderers. It's not a bad-looking race. I thought so too once. What made you change your mind? You'll find out. Soon you won't be able to distinguish between reality and imagination. Your mind will begin to play tricks on you so vividly that you'll be convinced that the world of your hallucinations really exists. Now you're making me curious. Curious, Dr. Masters? You won't like it. You'll lack the memory to remember anything, anything at all. They mustn't find me here with you, Dr. Masters. They told me not to speak with you. You think I'm mad don't you? Maybe I am. Then insanity too is part of our imagination. I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about. These Amazons know about drugs that will blot out your memory. They'll crush your mind. You'll do what they want. You'll be left without willpower, without initiative of your own. Look at me. How old do you think I am? I was 32 when I left Manaus four years ago. Now look at me. Why don't you get out of here? They can read your thoughts, outguess you every time. I tried to escape with Gina, but we didn't get very far. Anyway who can get through the jungle? We'll find a way. Mario! Mario? Please don't tell them you saw me. Please don't. Get back to your room, Mario. Quickly. What's the matter? - No. - No? If they see us this way they will kill me. Come on now, pull yourself together. They're just a bunch of women. I'll get you and Dellamano out of here. Don't worry. Why did you come here? Why? My life was over knowing I could never escape. Oh, come on now, take it easy. I can't bear it. Mario and now you. Me? Don't worry about me. All they've done so far is douse me in a bathtub and throw some perfume on me. Don't underestimate them. Mario did. Hey, do you think she'll practice her marksmanship on us? Doctor. She won't understand, will she? It doesn't matter. Make love to her. What? That she will understand. Oh, boy. How are you, my, uh, ugly little duckling? Don't you think you oughta put that thing down? You might hurt somebody. Keep on talking. Yeah, yeah, sure. Uh, uh, oh, my, what a ugly mess. Don't you ever comb your hair or, uh, is it hair? There that's better. Embrace her. Embrace her? Yes, go on. If she tells on us we both die. I'd almost rather. Uh, uh. Now what? Just make her feel you like her. I think she's got the message. Oh, you beautiful doll. Hey, oh! Hey! Ow. Ooh. Let's go. Oh, no, wait a minute. Let's get out of here. Yes, I'm, I'm sure you would. Yeah. Oh. Oh, well, that's not so bad. Very pretty. Yes, I think I'd like to meet you under different circumstances. Now wait a minute! Now wait a minute, ladies! We haven't been introduced! You're too friendly! Now, ladies! Why are you always so eager? Take it easy, will ya? Ah, now wait a minute. You two never give up. Oh, for me? Yes, well, it's beautiful artwork. I think I'll take it home with me. Boy, if I drank that I'd become a gibbering idiot. Thank you. Ooh. Pete, Pete. Pete. Pete, do you hear me? What is it? They've gone. Who's gone? The Amazons. They've gone into the jungle. - All of them? - Yes. There was an alarm. Come with me quickly. Mario. Come on. Don't move. She'll kill us. Now don't worry, this is the kid that has the crush on me, remember? Now just stay there. Don't! Now you're not gonna do anything foolish now are you my pretty baby? Now why don't you just give me that before it goes off. Ooh, ow! Ow, ow! She bit me! Let's go. Fernando. Carlos. They never knew who killed them. They blend with the leaves. When they fight they're part of the jungle. They may be watching us. We can't get us away if they don't want us to. They haven't found us yet. They're all around us. Take it easy. I can feel them. Come on, let's get out of here. Look a floating island. We still got a chance. Come on. See, I told you we'd lose 'em. Never. They won't let us escape, I know them. Well, they're not here now are they? Don't move. Snakes don't like people. They just leave us alone we'll be miles away by morning. They'll never give up 'til they get us back or kill us. Their existence must never be know to the outside world. I'll make a deal with 'em right now, I won't say a word. Well, it isn't much of a speedboat, but it'll get us there. You are so sure. Oh, of course, all rivers lead to the Amazon. Why before you know it we'll be Manaus. And we won't stay there, we'll, uh, fly to Rio. Just about time for the carnival. - Carnival? - Uh-huh. Then it must be February. Yes. I don't know what month it is. I lost track of time. Well, that's good. Why divide life by years? It makes it so much shorter. An animal gives up and dies but humans fight on, why? I think it's more fun to be alive don't you? There's a stone in the cave, a horoscope stone. I learned to read it. What'd it say? Whatever I wanted to read into the signs. That's not much help. I knew you were coming. You did? Hey, see I told you we had a date. It made me go on living. It also said. What? Well, it must've said that we were gonna get out of here, didn't it? That we would die together. Oh, why not? I won't mind after about 50 years of marriage. What's the matter? Don't you hear it? - What? - Listen. It's a plane. There. Hey! - Hey! - Hey, hey, hey, hey! We're down here! We can't look at every one of those medians of floating islands. Let's go back. I think we better have a closer look, Senor Crespi. I never forgive myself. All right, if you want to waste your time. - Down here! - Hey, hey! - Hey! - Hey, hey, hey! - Hey! - Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! There! There are people on that island. Smart of Masters. I came down the river on one of them myself. - Down here! - Hey! No, wait! He's gone. Two people. A man and a woman. A man and a woman. He'll be back. He's just gone for help. Light a fire if I just had a match. They will never find us. Never, never! - Gina. - I told you we have to die! - Gina! - I don't wanna die! Gina! - I don't wanna die! - Gina, shut up! See, I told you that pilot saw us. He's coming in for a landing. How about a swim? They treated you well, Ms. Vanni? Of course, or I wouldn't be alive. What kind of tribe was it? It has no name. They found you, Dr. Masters. Yes. Well, you two are certainly not very communicative. You've been away for years, Ms. Vanni. You must have had amazing experiences. And you, Dr. Masters, you don't want to tell me anything either, why? I tell you why, they've been with the Amazons. Can't you get that idea out of your mind? I can prove it. You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes. Look at this piece of cloth. That's what the Amazon's wear. It's woven by them. Am I right, Dr. Masters? You don't hear him contradicting me do you? Let me tell you their story. She lived with the Amazons. Those clothes that Dr. Masters is wearing he didn't have 'em when he left here. Where did you get them? Mario Dellamano died, those are his clothes. I gave them to Dr. Masters. Well, Crespi, that makes sense. Makes no sense to me. They're a pair of lying crooks. They know where the Amazons live, they want to keep the secret for themselves, and the gold, and the diamonds! They cheat us out of it! You certainly act very mysteriously, Dr. Masters. I'm glad to be alive that's all. I have nothing to add to Ms. Vanni's story. Can't you be fair to an old pal, Doctor? There's enough for everybody. Just lead us to the Amazons, we'll do the rest. You can have 50% of the loot. 60, 75, that's fair enough isn't it? When does the plane leave for Manaus? Within the hour. Thank you. Cheats, coot, hogs! But I don't need them! I can find those women myself! I will, I will, I will, I will, I will. - Pete, wait. - Hmm? Thank you. You're thanking me? - Yes. - Why? It would have been the end of that age old civilization if you had told. Yeah. I could write a book that would rock the world. Yeah, well, guess the world can do very nicely with one book less.
