Guglu. Say it, Amol. You must say it today. You don't have any more place in your belly to keep a secret. "What have you done?" "How did this happen?" That's what you asked me. -Guglu, please-- -It was easy for you? to let me go after getting me pregnant. Me? You left after getting me pregnant. I spent all these days alone. -Guglu, even I-- -Each night? How not to get pregnant. "Keep your pull-out game strong." A slip in time saves nine. "Don't use expired condoms." When it blows, you will be screwed! "Don't do it drunk." A short attention span is a recipe for disaster. But, no. All of you did all of these! But we're here for a PTA meeting. Next time if anyone gets pregnant, and sends their kid to this school? then they will be facing my wrath. Dismissed! Mom, why are you crying? What is all this melodrama? If there's something Amol sir said, he must be right. God. By the way, congratulations on the pregnancy. So, you'll complain about me? Look at this. Red, blue, yellow, green black. All these colors move ahead in life. But this white color pencil, which is good for nothing, stays in the box. And all of you? are like this white color pencil. Bloody useless! How dare you! That's ghastly racist of you! You come from the land of Gandhi. And don't forget, white lives also matter! Kneel! Down! Down! Bend down! Bend down! Why weren't you born as an adult? What did I do, sir? Sir? I finished 20 rounds clockwise. Now 20 rounds anti-clockwise. Go! Ashu Sharma! Did I give you a water break? You seem to have an unlimited supply of tears. Hold it. And fill it up to the brim with your tears! Fill it. Come on! Would he treat his own children the same way? God, don't bless anyone with a father like him. Kneel! -Koni? wear the cap. -Let's be kids again. Put on the cap, Koni. -Put on the cap, Koni. -Where is Guglu? I haven't seen her. You mean, Chef Guglu. Hey, that's a beautiful cake! And now look at this beautiful cake she baked. I ordered the cake. But don't tell Amol. Clever! -He'll be here any minute now. -Come on. Come on. Bloody thief! I am not a thief. I am your father-in-law. Sorry, Father. I didn't see you. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! These guys are back again to hog on the free cake. They have nothing better to do. Look at him. Wearing a cap over a cap! -Oh, God! -Khargosh! Khargosh! God knows where he is. -Khargosh! -Khargosh! Stop yelling! Hey! Yelling leads to heart attacks in older people. The doctors say so. Why didn't you add enough salt? It is a little burnt. Are you even listening to what I'm saying? You don't sprinkle salt over burnt areas! -You liked the joke? -Dad. -I'm not surprised. -Your mother will someday dent my body by nudging me! I really miss you. They can start begging for a child any second. Dad, pass me some Coke. Coke? Son, fill her up. I mean fill her glass with Coke. They only have one topic. We have been insisting for so long. Fill it up! One guy can't stop sneezing, and the other one is controlling his. Mom, don't make any comments about his sneezing. We have been sneezing even before the wedding. Mamta! Ours was like an automatic car. Before anyone could make any requests, we would already have a couple of kids. Bravo! Kavita's poetry! Come on, let's cut the cake. Alright. Come on. Or maybe next time, there will be one less person here. You never know! -That is rude, son! -Yes. Since you are sneezing so much, why don't you fulfill their desire? -Jinx. -No. What did you gift Amol? I'll give it to him in the room at night. Where are the condoms? This one's empty as well. My heart is crazy for you A gust of wind Has turned into a storm Tonight, I will turn All my dreams into reality For you I have sacrificed my slumber My curls are craving fire I am gonna love you too much Kiss me! Touch me! Kiss me! Touch me! The night is young My body is burning This fervor of love Won't let you sleep The night is young My body is burning This fervor of love Won't let you sleep Bikini body, bikini body Bikini body, yeah! My bikini body Bikini body Kiss me! I'm your hottie Come on and touch my soul I'm so naughty Tonight is the night that we roll Don't be shy Don't hesitate Just take me in your arms Kiss me! Kiss me! Touch me! Kiss me! Touch me! The night's young My body is burning This fervor of love Won't let you sleep The night's young My body is burning This fervor of love won't let you sleep? Are you running away? I was trying to. Go ahead? and put out all the fire. You don't love me one bit. I don't. All my wedding vows were out of hatred. Enough. All of this that you are doing? none of this is for me. You are doing it for a child! Well, I have to bear a child, not you! Do you want me to get pregnant? You are so weird. Even the mention of kids sends chills down your spine! They will keep laughing and playing around. What other games do they want to play? Haven't they played with my life enough? You? It was my selection for county cricket. County cricket. They broke my leg and shattered my dreams with a single balloon! I know, Amol? I have been trying really hard to at least get a job as a coach. I want to train older boys and let them play county cricket. But look at my fate. I have been stuck as a PE for little kids. And now, you want me to have kids at home! Why are you screwing up our present for what happened in the past and the future that's undecided? Why do you want to add kids to this little gang of ours? Go ahead. Fill my life with darkness. Why does she keep bothering me for kids? Frustrated wife badgers her husband to death with a rolling pin. And she used the same rolling pin to roll bread for dinner. This is the bloody rolling pin. The bloody rolling pin. Turn that off! Bro, don't vent your frustration on my Romila. And I am watching everything? It is an oddly complicated matter. We have discussed it a hundred times. I don't want kids. This isn't the first time I said it. You cannot hide someone's condoms and have your own way! In fact, I should be furious. I have been conspired against! And I am standing out here, with you! I never said no to romance. But having a kid is the issue. I hate kids! Happy birthday, bro! Look, Amol, you are safe as long as you are out here. Once you go inside, you won't be able to come out. Now you decide, to go or not to go. You made it up the stairs, but don't go in. Once you go in, there is no way out. Listen to me, go back. Good, good. I will quietly lie on the sofa. But she was crying inconsolably. It is that time to be together We are miles apart But our hearts are close Give approval to my love Says my crazy heart Says my crazy heart Go away. You are out of your mind, and I have to pay for it. Next time if I bother you, I'm willing to pay for it too. It is a sign from God. Things can go awfully wrong. You know what, let's just get out of here. Sneaking to the rooftop In the late evenings Sneaking to the rooftop In the late evenings I still remember The way you smiled And stole my heart Sneaking to the rooftop In the late evenings Romila! When will you be mine, Romila? Romila. Expiry date May 2016! Since when do condoms have expiry dates?! Bro!. Stealing my heart. Stealing my heart You need to take these pills twice a day, okay? -And-- -Doctor, please check my pulse as well. Sure, why not? No, I was just telling her the side effects these pills have on the kidney. Oh! So, what would you advise I should go for? Hemodialysis? Peritoneal dialysis? Immunofixation blood test? Whatever! Only if you say so, Doctor! Only if you say so. Dr. Satsangi, the next patient is waiting. By the way, these are not pills. I was giving these to you instead of toffees. Congratulations! He knows everything. He'll take care of your delivery, okay? Please leave. -Good morning, Doctor! -Good morning. Okay, so I have applied the gel. Should we start? Yes. Just call Romila and tell her I'll do the interview two hours earlier. Sir, she just called and canceled the interview. What?! Canceled?! When?! Last night. Last night is just? just? She's done that the tenth time! That bitch! Twentieth time, sir. I delivered 43 babies in a single day with these hands. Doesn't she feel this is worth covering? This is a record of sorts. Sir, I requested her to do the interview. But she told me she's got more important things to cover. Yeah, of course! There are important things. Yes, sir. She is attending the funeral of the Queen's dog. Yeah, of course. That is also important. Very? important. Even I felt so! Sir, I think it's a stone. It's not a stone, darling. It's a baby. What? I mean, is it true? Yeah. Look at it. Oh my God! But we were using protection. Life and condoms are full of surprises, baby. Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution! Be the change you wish to see in the world! "Dear Elizabeth and countrymen? It is with profound grief that I would like to inform you that my mental condition is in danger. I have been sent to the asylum twice, but I was thrown out of there as well." "They've never made me the coach. But I request you to donate generously for my upcoming brain transplant. Otherwise, I'll jump to death from the school rooftop. Killjoy, Amol Khote. Accepting Paytm, GPay, bank transfer. Prefer cash." -Clever! -It's okay, Mr. Khote. As long as you realize you are a lunatic. You could have asked me directly. We would have made adjustments post surgery. But I didn't write any of this, sir. These kids have written it! Sir, us? Why would we do such a thing? If we step on an ant, we immediately give it first aid. Angels. Who are you? Answer! JJ, 5B. I didn't ask for your username. Jigar Janardhan, 5B. -Nice name. -"Nice name!" I am crazy! I'm tired of telling you this. Yes, and I'm tired of hearing it! "If you let me coach high school kids, County Seven would have won the World Cup by now!" It's all engraved on my mind! But I'm stuck here with these little delinquents! -I understand. -To hell with your understanding! Are you going to do something or not? Am I crazy? -Am I crazy?! -Answer! Maybe. Maybe?! You little? What is going on here, sir? There's a door there. You never told me about it. This is not fair, sir. Should I check your birth charts as well? Recently I have been offering two birth charts complimentary on a single veneration. There's nothing to check. God has answered our prayers. May peace and tranquility prevail. May peace? Don't know about peace, but I see signs of war. What happened, Amol? What else? These kids have made my life miserable. I want to crush them. Khargosh, let's go make a hot cup of tea for Amol so that he calms down. Don't walk at a snail's pace. Hurry up. What's this? It is very close. Who? Rahu. Are you going to cook this for dinner? No, it is his piles report. He went to see the doctor yesterday. He's embarrassed to talk about it. Impossible. According to my calculations, you cannot have piles. You are currently in the phase of causing pain, not enduring any. Show me the reports. They are yours, right? Show me. These are pregnancy reports. -Whose? -Guglu's? Guglu's sister? Mamta's. Come on, sir. I think you are in the phase of causing pain. -Come on. -Look? you are already getting affected by it. -By what? -Rahu. It is just you. Come on. -Leave me. -Move. Come on. What do you think you are doing?! I'm teaching you a lesson. -Throw him outside. -Demon, will be doomed! You were in a bad mood, so? -Never mind. Congratulations-- -How did this happen? We always use protection. How did this? No. No? Never! Just because you don't want it? And why am I afraid to tell you this? It's a good thing. You should be happy. But you have forgotten how to be happy and loving. I cannot do this. But it's done now, Amol. You may be prepared to be a mother, but I'm reluctant to be a father! Then when will you be? Do you have an answer? Just because you are dumb, doesn't mean I have to be deaf. I can hear my feelings. I have always supported you. But if there's something I need, what do we do about it? It would have made you happier if I had aborted the child and come to you. Let it be, Amol. Don't say anything. Please say you wouldn't be happy. No. Please. Please just say you wouldn't be happy. Leave it. It will be like fanning the fire. Tell me that? you wouldn't be happy. Please, for my sake, tell me that you wouldn't be happy. Say you wouldn't be happy, Amol. Please? I cannot live with you in this house anymore. Kavita? we can't do this anymore. Can't we work out something? We love someone else. And, it is not you, it is not us. It's them. You see, these secret meetings and secret conversations with you? What if Guglu finds out? You see, we cannot cheat. It is rare for me to have such a good connection with someone. I penned a couple of lines for you yesterday, Tony. Please? When relationships are so deep? When relationships are so deep, -how do they fall apart? -Wow! When the heart has no bones, how does it break apart? -Bravo. Bravo. -Amazing! Hey! Your whistle makes my heart skip a beat! You keep sending me your poems, and I'll keep sending you my recorded whistles. Listen, we can be friends, right? They're built on emotions. Go away. Let's go. Poor thing has been left alone. Look, we can discuss the child later. First, let's bring Guglu home. It is been two months, and I haven't apologized to her yet. How will you do it? Go. You tell her. Wait. Go on, give this to her quickly. Go. It is not my cup of tea. I will just make things worse. Maybe it is rare out here, but this is normal for Indian pigeons. Keep shitting on cars for the rest of your life. Why did you dirty my car? Sorry. So, Guglu. -How are you? -I'm fine, Doctor. Then why are you here? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm here for my checkup. Then why are you alone? Where's Amol? Is he out? Yes, he is out of my life. Sir! The next patient is getting very restless. He's saying it's urgent. Shall I send him in? No. Ask him to relax. -Okay? -Sir, I tried doing that. But he just won't listen. Handle it! Okay. She's so useless. Sorry. So, what happened? Anything serious? He didn't find this "good news" to be good at all. -Oh! -Sir, he refused to relax. Now what? You are as useless as a fork in a soup bowl. What? Please? get out. Please! Please understand what I'm going through. No manners, as usual! I came here before you. You are Mike's mother, right? I will detain him. Just stay here. You already did that! Please. You have to? -No problem, Doctor. -Thank you. Doctor. I came in first! And this ridiculous maggot just butted in! Amol, what is wrong with you? I'm your family doctor, but that doesn't mean you can butt in whenever and wherever you want. -But, Doctor, you need to-- -Shut up, you imbecile! Creating havoc in school, and havoc outside. You ruined my dear Mike's life. Both of you, just shut up. Tell me what happened. Well, all this puking? it's driving me crazy. Same, Doctor! Same! Daddy is pregnant! I have a job. I'm constantly fatigued. I have no energy. Ditto! Ditto! Daddy is pregnant! I need to pee? 10,000 times a day. Pee too! Sorry. Me too! Doctor, the same things are happening to me. Daddy is pregnant! I think your situation looks more serious, love. I'll come back later. Okay. Doctor? why are our symptoms similar? Does she have food poisoning as well? No. She is pregnant. So, you mean to say I'm pregnant too! No, I want to say that you don't have food poisoning. Then what is it? You guys have been running multiple tests for over a month. Random tests, antibiotics, and whatnot! To hell with it! Look, Amol, these reports suggest that you don't have food poisoning. You don't have stomach flu. You don't have a gallbladder issue. You don't have gastroenteritis or appendicitis. Wait, where are you going? No, you continue. I will come back with Mike's mom for the delivery. Okay? Delivery is too far away. Before that happens, your problems like puking, dizziness, fatigue may get worse. Maybe you will start having mood swings. Oh, you are used to having mood swings. Maybe you will have food cravings. Maybe your belly? will swell up. Maybe. There's got to be something! Maybe you are out of your mind. Maybe I will strangle you with your own stethoscope. When you step out of here, you may get run over by a car! Maybe! Maybe! Maybe, my foot! Your doctor needs a heavy dose of electric shocks. He has completely lost his mind! Sir! Maybe. Sneaking to the rooftops In the late evenings You stole my heart You stole my heart It is time to let our love Reach its destination It's time to finish The conversation we started It is time to let our love Reach its destination It's time to finish The conversation we started Let's erase these distances Stop testing my patience Stop testing my patience I love you, Guglu. Sneaking to the rooftops In the late evenings I still remember that day When you stole the intoxication From my lips with your eyes Do you remember How you ran your fingers Through my tresses? You are allowed To make those mistakes again This moment is All about falling in love This moment is All about falling in love That's my sweater. I accidentally picked it up. And I mistakenly put it on. Don't read too much into it. It looks nice. Shall I? send a couple more? You just get out. Guglu. -Come home. -No. We have been together for 20 years. Please don't do this. Whatever it is, we will deal with it. I am sure you haven't even unpacked yet. I unpacked completely. I see. Go on. Quickly get your bag. You sweater thief! Damn you. Just you, me, and our marriage. No kids, no damnation. Have you thought of a name? Name for what? let's see. Let us go home and talk about this. Talk about what? You know? Listen to me! Guglu! Guglu, what happened? You didn't come here for me. You came here for your own sake. Why would I come for my own sake? Because nothing else is in your control. Guglu. Daddy is pregnant! Are you making fun of me? Daddy is pregnant! Guglu? I? -I? -Just leave. Please leave. Guglu. what have I done? Why do we need to have a child right away? This is why you came. Please leave. You are not the Amol I loved. Can you live alone? I'm alone even when you are around. It is getting very close. Rahu! Demon, you will be doomed. Look, you are already getting affected by it. Rahu. All this puking and giddiness does not seem normal. What is happening in my stomach? Your problems like puking, dizziness, fatigue may get worse. Maybe you will start having mood swings. Maybe you will have food cravings. Maybe your belly? will start to swell up. Why do my pants feel tighter? Where's my phone? Google and Guglu think they are always right. If tomorrow my aunt grows a mustache, will I call her uncle? Something is gonna happen. IT IS POSSIBLE! Hey, Google. Dr. Satsangi, please. Do you mean Satsangs? No, I meant top Indian gynecologist Dr. Satsangi in the UK. Dr. Lakhanpal. In Yorkshire County? Dr. Lakhanpal. In Birthtown? Dr. Lakhanpal. Seventeenth Street? Dr. Lakhanpal. Oh, that bloody Lakhanpal? I too will be famous someday! Remember that. Damn it! Dr. Satsangi is? -Get out. -What?! -Get out! -Okay. I wonder what is gonna happen! Doctor. Doctor. Doctor! Doctor? Me? Such respect? Doctor. For the last couple of months? I have been hiding my belly behind obesity. But now, the matter is getting out of breast-- I mean chest-- It's getting out of hand. You are lactating! No! I am oozing milk! It's called lactating. What?! How is that possible? I have no control over my own body. What's going on with me? This is what happens when the patient thinks he is the doctor. -Sorry, Doctor. -Sorry, my foot! Look, Amol. I've told you this before. All your symptoms indicate that you are pregnant. Pregnant? Who put the baby inside me?! You did it yourself! How can I put a baby in myself?! You wanted a baby in you. I never wanted a baby in me. I didn't want a baby in Guglu! Why would I want one in myself? I mean? what proof do you have that there's a baby in here? Check it! Of course. Even I have that curiosity. Come. Okay, Doctor. Hey, there's still time for that! Oh, God! I've got some good news and bad news for you. The baby is healthy. -Good news? -Healthy. Bad news? Baby. What happened? -I could feel something? -Kicking? Wow! You were looking for proof, right? Now you have it. Very good. Sir? Doctor, please save me. This is God's will. Well, doctors are akin to God. No, not me. Doctor, please save me! We used all kinds of protections. You see, life and condoms are full of surprises, son. Doctor? Can we abort it? No way. Six months. The baby's life will be in danger. And you could end up dead too. I don't want to die! I just want some peace! I mean I always did. Oh, you want a daughter! Let me check the sex of the baby. No, no! I wanted peace and tranquility of body and mind, Doctor! What? what can we do now? What? Second opinion! Can we consult another doctor about the symptoms? -Sure. -Okay. Let me call Dr. Lakhanpal. Come. It's ringing. Here. What do I say? Tell him the truth. The baby is kicking. You're lactating. Tell him. -Tell him. -Hello? No. If I bother you again? we'll pay the price together. God gave you a sign. Now you have to pay for it. Guglu. -Do you want to tell Guglu? -No, I don't! -You don't tell her either. Please. -Fine. We'll deliver the news and the baby together. Doctor, whatever you said about my tummy swelling up? it's all coming true. Is there anything else left to experience? Of course. You've yet to experience the second most painful experience in the world. Labor pain. What's the first? Burns. You can leave. Out. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Please keep the phone here. -Oh, sorry. -Yeah. Koni, you elbow me every day. But your pony to my face got me out of control. What are you saying, Tony? Why are you making the bed? when we have to spoil it anyway? Come on. Listen. Whistle for me. Whistle? Alright, whatever you want. Mamta. These guys? Forget those guys and hear my latest update. Remember that thing about pregnancy's sixth sense? I think it's come true. I think he did it this time. -Mamta-- -Listen? let's turn on the radio. No one will hear us. You are right, darling. I think he has finally put a bun in my oven! Anyway, we tend to make a lot of noise. Guglu, say something! Forget the radio! You need to latch the door! Aren't you ashamed? Go on. Romance each other all you want! But you should check around first! My child wants grandparents, not an uncle! This is my channel. You are watching my news. I am Romila, and I am watching everything. What are you staring at? I? I'm wearing Dad's old clothes. I was missing him. These are not your dad's old clothes. These are my old clothes. I wore them when I was pregnant with you! Earlier you would flare up your nostrils, and now you roam around with a flared tummy! Guglu has a baby in her tummy, but what's the deal with your tummy? What have you been up to? -Why are you yelling? -I'm-- I'm not yelling! I hope my child doesn't turn out rude like you. What? Forget that. Ever since Guglu left him? there is only one thing I've been praying for. Lord, please perform a miracle so that I can be around my grandchild for the next nine months, and watch him grow up in this very house! Don't make a wish like that! What are you saying? Am I not even allowed to pray for his child?! Friends! Sorry. I am gonna be the father of someone's child. Daddy is pregnant! Daddy is pregnant! Daddy? Shame on you! Daddy is pregnant! Daddy is pregnant! Daddy? Something's gonna happen! This bizarre matter Will destroy me What am I gonna say When someone asks? Sounds funny to others But to me, it's trouble God has betrayed me! Pushpa, I am pregnant. Are you telling me a joke to make me laugh? Nonsense! Bugger! You think this is a joke? Really? Have you ever heard about a man getting pregnant? No! I mean, why not! All you need is someone with guts. Anyway, tell me. Is it mine? -Is it mine? Is it mine? -Stop it! -Stop it. Stop it. -Is it mine? Stop it! Your perfume is making me dizzy! Amol! -Look at that! -It's like an island! -It's like an island! -Get lost! Daddy is pregnant! Daddy is pregnant! Daddy? Shame on you! Daddy is pregnant! Daddy is pregnant! Daddy? Something is gonna happen! I need something sour. Like tamarind. Or pickle. Anything. I need something sour. Something sour. Pickle. Sour pickle. Tamarind. Anything. Pickle. Sour pickle. Tamarind. Anything. Pickle. Lunch boxes. I will lick all these bags. I will lick all the lunch boxes. This is my food. He ate all the pickles? The man left the parathas? and ate all the pickles! Moreover, he has left notes in our lunch boxes. "Sorry, dear. I forgot to pack pickles." Look at his behavior! And then he says he's not a lunatic! Amol, this problem has gotten out of hand. Never trust problems or your belly. They steer out of control at any time. He's been stuffing his face, and he's still hungry! How will he make us exercise? You need to take it out. Not yet. It's the seventh? I have three months to go. I said I need 48! Sir, even before our new stock comes in, you come back for a new size. Your taunts are spot on. Why can't you get me the right size?! Is that Amol in there? No, ma'am. It's a crazy guy in there. Same thing. Why does he need size 48? How do I know? His tummy is sticking out. Is there a problem, sir? Depressed? Missing someone? Hey! Stay in your limits. What happened? Eating and drinking too much, I reckon. No one to take care of you? You can only see my tummy. You don't know what's inside it. He's sick. And don't try to be my wife. She left me. I left him? And please, Sister, give me my pants. I need them. There's a bloody discount, sir! I think you should take it! Friends! In just three months, there's gonna be an explosion. Sorry? there can be explosions. Emotions make love unbearable I hope this doesn't make me the hot topic Emotions make love unbearable I hope this doesn't make me the hot topic How long will my rotten luck Conspire against me? Like a sweetmeat Making my mood sour Sounds funny to others But to me, it's trouble There's no time to pull myself together Daddy is pregnant! Daddy is pregnant! Daddy? Something is gonna happen! Do you need anything? It's okay. I can understand. You did it. Even the doctors were impressed. They said you didn't trouble them much. How? You trouble me so much. How do you women tolerate so much pain? The same way we tolerate you. Will you ever leave me again? Daddy? Daddy? Guglu. Guglu! Daddy? Guglu! Guglu! I just hate kids. Is that why I am pregnant? Fate has kicked me in the? guts. I don't know what I'm gonna do with this kid. Guglu, I'm? I'm in deep trouble. I'm very confused. If you were around? you would have made fun of me. But you would have also found a solution. -I miss you-- -Hello? someone dialed the wrong number. Do you want to talk to a stranger? Go ahead! Come on! Take it! Does he think I wouldn't know it's him calling if he doesn't call from his mobile number? -Child, listen to me-- -I don't want to listen! No one cares about me! I sent such a nice joke on WhatsApp in the morning. Both of you read it but neither of you replied! -Because it was an old joke. -So what, Dad? Everyone knows that I don't like coriander in my food. But there is coriander in every dish! Child, I will stop ordering coriander altogether. Okay? -Happy? -No, Dad! Also, you two watched the MasterChef finale without me! No, child. I never saw that. Of course, Dad! Are my feelings invisible to you? My baby! My child! My dear Guglu! Don't cry, my child. Guglu? Hey! My child? we are always there for you. Koni and Tony are always there for you. We will never leave you. Your dad is always with you. What? Sorry. You see, I'm pregnant. So, I'm just overwhelmed. I love you. She's ours! Okay. This is your house. Don't worry. Sleep, little one? Hey! Can't you see? I'm tucking the baby in. Hey, go to sleep. Because if you wake up, my secret will be exposed. Can I take a sip? One little sip. Thanks. You're not getting drunk, are you? Are you? You wanna know a secret? Just a couple of miles away? your sibling is growing up too. You could have tagged along with them! -Yes. -Naughty one! Oh! Yes, we have the same treacherous love? Bro? who are you talking to? What are you doing? I'm with my Romila. -I am Romila. -You dog. And I am watching everything. I'm not a dog, bro. I'm Khargosh. If you are Khargosh, then why are you bleating like a goat? Why are you always lost in Romila's thoughts? Give me that. I'll set you up with her. After this, you won't be chasing after Romila. Romila will be chasing after you. You are a man who is pregnant! You are the first pregnant daddy to bring this kind of news! What is bustling inside you? The love of a mother or the capacity of a father? Focus on the belly! On the belly! From where will the child come out? -I don't know. -How dare you shut me out! The audacity! The sheer audacity of this man to shut the door in my face! In my face! But there's no point in shutting the door. For the sake of views-- I mean for the sake of news, I can go anywhere. As soon as I received this video clip from Kharghosh007? Kharghosh007? This one thing that was exclusive to women? to get pregnant, to give birth? has been taken away from us by the male gender. Patriarchy has reached a new low. Male toxicity at its worst! Hello, Ms. Romila. This is Khargosh. He's a very cute pet. I mean? animal. A person. And I am? I am? I am pregnant! You don't believe me? Ask Dr. Satsangi. It's kicking! Keep your distance or you'll get hurt. This Ronaldo is making my life? very messy! "My brother is pregnant!" #shithappens #karmaisabitch #oneplusonefree Stand straight. #mybrotherstrongest You? -What have you done? -Sorry, bro. The condom had expired. -Knocked up?! Get out. -Bro? Out! Amol? what is this? Amol! Amol! Look. We have now connected with Dr. Satsangi. Mr. Amol's doctor. He's guiding him in this tough situation. I have given this a new term. "Pregmancy." "Pregmancy"? My patient Amol Khote is experiencing the same things that a pregnant woman does. What? Mood swings. Food cravings. Kicks. Lactation. What is lactation? Daddy? Big belly, nausea, you name it. He turned out to be a real demon. Where did he come from?! He must be burned at the stake and vaporized. No, no! -No! -Mom? -No. -Mom? No! This is a lie. -Just listen to me. -It's a lie. -Listen to me. -I don't believe it! -I don't believe it. -Then tell me? what is this? Did I swallow a balloon or a football? Something is growing inside me. Life was already screwing me? and now even the baby is kicking from inside. Kicking? Not right now. I see. It's okay. This is how your wish was granted! You've become a grandma. Are you happy now? I made an innocent wish. I just wanted to become a grandma. But my son is pregnant with a child! You have ruined my family! Here? go ahead. Write down your poetry first. I have a question. If you are bearing a child, then what does that make Guglu? Tell me. -Mother. -Mother? And what will it make you? Fa? Fathermother. Fathermother? What on earth is a fathermother? What are the kids going to call you? Little mama? Big mama? My mama? Or your mama? I'm losing my mind. I think something's growing inside me. I'm feeling dizzy. -I'm going to faint. -I'm getting furious. And I have invested years of my experience and talent in this case. And now, my patient? he's a bit tired. He's nine months pregnant. -Oh, God? -We decided on? keeping this a secret till the due date. Satsangi, I will gonna kill you. "I will kill you, Satsangi!" Amol Khote is experiencing the same things that a pregnant woman does. Satsangi! What nonsense is this? He is pregnant?! Where did it come from? Have you ever thought about how you are gonna get it out? This is a medical marvel. Is he a superhero? No. For locals like you, it's an act of nature. Call it destiny. -It can't be an act of nature. -Why? Otherwise, Mamta would have also been pregnant by an act of nature! Oh, God! -The poor woman is traumatized! -Why? Because I ended up getting pregnant before her. And now, Amol is pregnant as well! Oh, God! That Mamta! Why are you so stressed? You and Amol can give your first child to her. Why will I give away my child? And inside? He's kicking from the inside. -Who? -It's a boy! -What? -No! No way! This is a lie. It is a lie. He's going through the exact same things you are going through. When did you leave him? The same day you handed me the reports. Right. That was the time when his "pregmancy" was confirmed. Yes, that's true. Both of your reports were positive. I think you two conceived at the same time. And I wouldn't be surprised if you both deliver on the same day. Didn't he opt for an abortion? He likes the idea of it. He did think about it? but it was too late. It's in his nature to be late. Wait, Guglu! Where are you going? Let's sneak out of here. Oh, God! I'll have to stay like this till delivery. Will people question my manhood because I'm pregnant? But even Guglu is pregnant with my child? -How is this possible? -No idea. -I mean? he got pregnant! -Yes. -Exactly. -What is all this? -Should I call him? -Yeah. Why can't he call me? -I mean, can't he call-- -Mrs. Guglu! Amol got "pregmant" by himself? -Or do you have any involvement? -Please. in this sensational act? Let her go. Do you believe in black magic? Don't make a mountain out of a molehill Or is this your sperm web? I mean spun web. -Are you two aliens? -Me? No. Or were you aware of his hidden talents? Sisters! Come fast! Sit, sit. Thank you. It's okay, sister. It's their job? to cause unnecessary embarrassment. By the way, are you-- Someone else has caused her embarrassment, sister. I heard about all the drama. By the way, I heard he was a nice guy. He was a demon, sister. Or you might fall to death! He was out of balance on that night. Sometimes on top, sometimes below. What if all that jumping around made some of his sperms go back into him? You gotta watch your balance. Yes. I've been getting a lot of jolts recently. And what are you saying? How is it possible Stop it, child. Enough. First, he didn't want me to get pregnant. Now he is pregmant himself. What is he going to do now? -Next left. -Next left. Oh! Is your house that way? Even I live that way. Next left and stop. Thank you, sister. Please stay? a little longer. It was nice talking to you. I pray that you two get back together. Those who are destined to be together? don't part ways like this. I guess we were destined to part ways. I tried convincing my heart I regret it didn't understand -Congratulations! -How did this happen? My eyes have turned into clouds I wander around like a madman -I don't deserve this punishment -You may be prepared to be a mother, but I'm reluctant to be a father! The woman I loved I could never make her mine I have gained nothing The heart has made a blunder The heart has made a blunder The heart has made a blunder What is gonna happen to us? The heart has made a blunder What is gonna happen to us? What will happen? What is gonna happen to us? I cannot do it without you. I don't want to do it without you. Hello? Hello? I'm broken My courage is shattered into little pieces My courage? Even death seems? I thought I really loved you. But what's the point of this love? I've never been able to give you any love. Hello? Even my destiny has rejected me The heart has made a blunder The heart has made a blunder What is gonna happen to us? What will happen? What will happen? What will happen? What is gonna happen to us? The dreams we saw were all lies The heart is bruised Tell me, why did this happen? I forgot how to look beyond myself and feel others' pain. Hello? Hello? What the hell is going on?! Why do you call if you can't talk?! To hear my voice?! Selfish! What kind of a mother will you be?! What do you think? You will call and I will listen?! To hell with you! What will happen? What will happen? What is gonna happen to us? What will happen? What will happen? What is gonna happen to us? I don't know how you endured all that pain alone. Because I can't do this. What is even more painful? is the fact that I am not with you right now. I'm sorry, Guglu. I keep yelling at the kids all day? whom I hate so much. But I love you so much. I don't know why I can't express it to you. -Father? -Hey! Stay away! -Father? -Stay away! It can spread through contact. Stay away. Father? What? What is it? I wanted you to make her pregnant? but you made her sad. Father, I want to talk. I don't want to talk. I want to talk to Guglu, not you! -She is gone. -Gone? Yes. She has gone to grandma's place in this condition. In this condition! You didn't let her live here peacefully. But-- Taxi! Taxi! You won't get any taxis. Taxi drivers are on strike today. What? What's going on with you? Here? I'm talking to you. What's going on with you? You drove Guglu away. Mamta has also been stressed. You know, she has been nagging Vishnu to get "pregmant". Poor guy has been walking around with a pillow strapped to his stomach! What have you done, man?! Father, I have to get to the bus stop. I saw some kids screaming at the bus stop. -On the bus. -Just kids. Let them have fun. No. They have been kidnapped! -What? -Kidnapped! Yes! -You and I, we need to help. -Come on. -Let's go bus station. -Go, go, go! -Okay. Let's go. -I'm coming too! No. I'll just sit like this. What if I contract this disease? He's the one. He's the kidnapper. Hey, you! Come along, you kidnapper. Guglu? "What have you done?" "How did this happen?" That's what you asked me. Guglu, please? -It was easy for you? to let me go after getting me pregnant. Me? You left after getting me pregnant. I spent all these days alone. Clinics. Nausea. Overflow of emotions. Carrying this tummy wherever I go. And puking as well. -Yes, that as well. -Yes. I have missed you. -But, Guglu-- -Being alone? every night. Guglu, even I did these things. It used to make me mad. But now I don't feel anything at all. -Guglu, please-- -No, honestly. No pain, no anger, nothing at all. See? You are right in front of me, and I don't feel a thing? -Sit down, dear. -Where is the driver? -Where is the driver? -Driver! Where is the driver? God knows where he is! No, no! He cannot drive! -He will kill us! -I'm gonna save us today, Guglu. Amol! Hail Maharashtra! Hello? Tell Dr. Satsangi that we are on our way. Guglu has gone into labor. Amol, are you okay? Mister Mummy! Hello? Tell the doctor that both the babies are coming. There are going to be two deliveries. Mister Mummy! Stop! Criminal! Guglu? we are almost there. Look ahead and drive! Mister Mummy! You'll be alright. Guglu, we will have to do a C-section on you. But you need not worry. You'll be unconscious. You won't know a thing. Why are you coming towards me? We'll have to try C, D, E, F, G sections on you to see which section works. There must be a different way! Leave him! If you attend to him, who is going to attend to me? I will. Lakhan? How are you? Incredibly handsome as usual. Thank you. I saw your interview. Oh! Jealous? Jealous? Got to you? And me to you. Hey! Are you guys strolling in the park? Sorry, darling. Sorry. But who are you? Oh! He? He's UK's topmost gynecologist Dr. Lakhanpal Satsangi. So, Guglu, you're ready to go. Start pushing. But he said he'll have to do a C-section. It's in his nature to misguide people. Sweetheart, you have to push harder. Come on. Baby number one is on its way. Baby number one? Of course. You're having twins. Didn't he tell you? Who? You two? Not us! We are talking about her. What? Didn't you know?! I didn't want to know. And who are you to ask that? But you knew, right? No. He would have made you two unconscious and told everyone that you two gave birth to one each, and he would become a hero in the eyes of the world. Relax. It was just a harmless prank, you know. Harmless prank?! Harmless prank?! He has played this harmless prank on my patients as well. What? You're hungry for publicity. If you used your efforts at work, you would have been in my place today. Now, if you'll excuse me. I will take your leave. He's there for you. The best. Take some anesthesia before you leave. -Why? -You're going to get thrashed. -Is the police outside? -Yes. Okay. Dr. Satsangi. No, I'm not Dr. Satsangi. No. I am experiencing some of the? symptoms. Guglu? So cute. Doctor? what's inside me? There's nothing inside you. Then? who is kicking?! It's called? sympathetic pregnancy. This means the husband? starts experiencing the pain of his pregnant wife. And this happens when the husband loves his wife unconditionally. His body starts reacting? like his wife's body to share her pain. Your belly will go away in a couple of days. But you will experience this pain as long as she does. In medical terms, it's called couvade syndrome It's a very strange thing. And although it's rare, it's true. Just like your love. I won't keep it inside me today. I will say it today. He? why isn't he crying? Perhaps he's overjoyed. You? you were supposed to come through me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I was running from myself, not you. I had begun to hate myself? not you. I was looking for happiness. You can look for it all over the world? but you find it in your own little world. Even the biggest dream? is too small in front of this. Son? I'm not worthy of teaching you much. But there's just one thing I want to tell you. Hear me out. If you want to be happy? then do it now. If you want to fall in love? then do it now. If you cannot do it now? you might forget it altogether like I did. He is lucky. His father understood the meaning of love by becoming a mother himself. Love was the reason behind his condition. There's love within him. But he forgets to express it. Until two minutes ago? I thought I could never love anyone more than you. Son, from now on, you are my number one. This is cheating. I'll always be number one in your life. Don't worry, you are my number one. I'm going to tell him that you birthed him. Hey! Hey? that's cheating. Mister Mummy! I love you. I? Hey! Baby number two is on its way! THIS CONDITION IS CALLED "COUVADE SYNDROME" IN THIS ARTICLE, YOU WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT COUVADE SYNDROME WHICH IS OFTEN EXPERIENCED DURING PREGNANCY PREGNANT ONCE AGAIN
