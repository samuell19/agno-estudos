One hundred for six vcds, good quality guaranteed. Mister, what do you think about wah? Wah is a bastard, he always takes away my vcd but never pays. Damn it. Wah?! Of course, I know him! He is very handsome. I would like to sleep with him. You bitch! You are just like him, you don't like to shower too. You don't like to shower too! Wah?! He is a mob who doesn't collect protection fee. What do you think about him? He is ugly, but he is quite handsome. He is nasty but is quite sexy. He lives up there. Thief... it's a robbery! Stop... Don't guess, those are my legs. I am wah. My friends call me wah. If you don't like me then you can call me asshole. Today is my mother's birthday. I've got a new haircut. Do you like it? Who is in my family? My mother, she is like a slut. I have a dog too, but it is always sick. I live with a father too, but he is quite stupid! Wah, are you looking for me? No! Continue your reading. I rent him the smallest room ever found in Hong Kong. What is my relationship with my mother?! It's like... Let me finish first?! No... let me... Let me finish... What is wrong with you?! Pay or not? We can talk about everything except money. I should never have given birth to you. Because of you I became less beautiful. Someone told me that you were a piece of shit. Who told you not to use a condom? It won't waste much time! Stop talking back to me! Okay! Just keep your money. I decided to become a whore. Why? So it will be a shame on you! I give up! Take it. This is my big brother, I always have to take care of him. He looks big, but he has a heart problem. You don't believe me? Am I right? I have buddy named tart. I don't mean a dessert, just a name. He likes to mess around with girls. Hello! Where is salad? She is serving your mother's friends. How dare you told her to do it? What do you think she is? Does she have to do everything for you?! Including a waitress right here? Want to be tart's girlfriend, you have to be something. Otherwise, how will I like her? I don't get it! How can any girl like you?! Okay... It's weird that she doesn't want to leave you. My dad taught me some skills. I love to listen. Before she turns sixty, don't let her eat happy. Before she turns seventy, don't tell her the truth. If she has any complaints, just smack her like a little boy. After that, she will treat you like a king. Miss wong, why don't you go play some mahjong? Wah is trying to hurt me. I don't see any harm. You two stop messing around! It's dinner time. Hold it. Where is Margaret? I didn't see her! What the hell! Hasn't she showed up yet? Bitch! Did you call me? Not you! It's me. Asshole! Look at this. - What? - It's so nasty! It's better than your look. Miss feil. Father, help yourself! See, I am playing mahjong. - This is a gift for you. - Thanks. Book?! Don't you know a book will bring bad luck to a gambler? But this is a holy Bible! Didn't you give me... One of this before? Last year is the old testament. This is the new testament. So you gave me an old gift last year?! No! The old testament is like the first part, and this is the 2nd part. Does it matter? Bingo! This book brings good luck. You asshole look more handsome than me. This is for you. I told you many times, don't stand next to me when I am sitting. Do you want me to look at you like this?! Why are you wearing high heels?! You're already taller than me! Sorry! I forgot! You forgot?! What is wrong with you? You look like your mother just died or something?! I am not! Don't you want to cry?! No... Don't cry! Be a good girl and don't cry! Here drink it! No! It's too cold! Let me drink it. Cheers... What's wrong?! Margaret is not here yet. Look at the menu, we will have abalone and shark fins and all only cost one thousand and seven hundred. Why are you showing it to me?! You are going to pay. Yeah right! Father, this asshole doesn't respect his mother. I want to follow you to become a nun. I don't think you can follow any one of the decalogue. How dare you talk to my mom like this?! Want me to kick your ass? Okay! Kick his ass... You will pay the bill then. The shark fin's soup is good! Have some more. Margaret, why are you so late?! Where is wah? He is over there! Yes, Margaret is here. Everything is on me tonight. You said it! Wah, go over there, I want to tell you something. Can't you wait? Let's eat something first. No! I have something to tell youl! Look at her, she is eager to see me! It will only take a second. Is she wah's girlfriend?! So what! She never says hi to me! Who cares! Right! What is she up to? A stupid model! Only shot one lousy napkin commercial! She thinks she is some kind of super-star. Even napkin needs commercial?! Why do you have to go to Taiwan? I signed a manager, we are planning to make a record. It will take at least three, four years before I can come back. So what? You can always come back to see me. Wah, don't you understand? I want to be famous. I don't care how much I put in, I have to be famous, you know? - Quiet, okay? - I have something to tell you. In my eyes, you are nothing but a loser. Okay. But I am single-minded to you. But no girls will like you. If a man is successful, lots of girls will love you. And you have nothing. No girl will like you the way you are. Why can't you get a job, or be a robber. So what if you are good at riding. You can't make money with that. I don't want to marry you and have our wedding feast here. Okay, I will go get a real job then. It's too late! I think you should go find a new girlfriend! These are all the gifts you gave me. - Wah, what is it? - Nothing! Nothing! She said she wants to go be a singer in Taiwan. You guys broke up?! Who cares about her, forget her! I am okay... Are you sure? Of course, nothing is wrong with me! This is for you. Today is my mother's birthday, I want to drink a lot. - Asshole. - What? That kind of girl is nothing but a ugly slut. Hard to sleep with! Why don't you go find a new slut? Brush her off. Come on, let's drink. What, you guys want to make me drunk? Of course! You?! Come on! Drink! I will make him drunk, come on! Be careful... Sit down... Why don't we clean her first? I want you to serve me. Sorry! I have to serve god. We will do it again some other day. Hey. I will increase your rent. Okay! Increase his rent. Leave! Salad is waiting for you. Okay! Bye. Where are you going? Lighting a joss-stick. Can you do it? Of course! Listen to me. My asshole is really a nice guy, so you better find him... A pretty nice girl in a hurry. Or I will change to believe in Jesus. I have this son only... He is my sweet-heart. Watch it or no more joss-sticks for you. Let me do it. You will find a very very nice girl. I love you. "Wealth" Boy boy... You are naughty. Ice, is it you? Dad. Didn't you tell me that you want to go to Hong Kong before? Are you going to take me?! Next week I have to go to Hong Kong... For business. I want you to come with me. Do you know why I rather sending you to england to study... Than letting you go to Hong Kong? You don't want me to become a troubled child. No! You should know that reason. I don't want you to go look for your mother. Your mother left us for Hong Kong when you were little, and she never came back. Our family was poor at that time. Luckily my business became sucessful, that is why we are so rich today. So, I don't want you to see the heartless woman again. I don't want to have anything to do with her again. - Mother Lee. - What is it? Is my mother pretty? Yes you look just like her. Isn't she money minded? I don't know. Does she love me? Silly girl! All parents love their kids. Why did she leave us for all these years? Can we take boy boy with us? I checked on this matter already, but there is too much trouble. It won't make it to leave for Hong Kong. I will take you with me. And I will find my mother too. Even if I only can see her for a glance. Oh! My god. Thank you. "Father: Something happened at home, come back at once" Does wah go riding again? Give way... I'm sorry. Come back again. God will help you, come down first, don't be silly. Slut... what for? Not me! Fix the TV for me first. Would you be quiet? Wah, you are an asshole! You don't even care about me. Shut up or I will kick you out. You don't care about me. He is going to jump! Don't mind him! He does this 20 times a year. He wants to jump no matter he wins money or not. He wants to jump no matter he has money or not. He wants to jump even if he beats up somebody. I don't know what is he up to this time. What is wrong with you? The economy is poor right now and everyone is in pain. I'm in real bad mood. I sell pirate vcd and I got arrested. I can't find any job. Salad wants to dump me. I should just die! Salad is going to dump you?! Good! But I think it's kind of late. Aunt, you are cold blooded. Think about it. She has been with you for ten years already. And you don't want to marry her. Isn't there something wrong? Also, you always go sleep around. Look at her, she has a great body, she has big tits. Look at yourself, you only have a big ass. I am going to jump... Go ahead! I want to close the window and turn on the air-condition. Aunt, you're so cold-blooded! - Come down. - Come down. Come here. Isn't that a black widow. It's brown, should we name it brown widow? No! It's a spider! What? I am not scared! I am not scared of a spider. I love spiders. I used to keep it as a pet. What? I don't want to die! Let go! Hold on... Go somewhere else! Don't stay here anymore. Forget it! It is just an insect! It won't understand you! Go away... I am going to kill you. Go away... Dead or still alive? Don't die! I am sorry! Relax, is he your brother? If he dies, I will be charged with murder! You bastard! Stop crying! - Wah. - What? If I end up in a jailhouse. Tell salad to find a better man. And tell her not to wait for me. You wish. - Wah. - What? You go find salad right now and tell her that I got in big trouble. See if she will worry about me or not! You want me to help you. Please! Okay! Where is she? You are really my good friend. Hello, miss poa. I am your personal assistant while you stay in hk. If you need anything, from eating to sleeping, just call on me. Feel free to ask me anything. Why do I have to speak mandarin when I don't know how?! The boss sold the firm to a mainlander. I look like a fool to speak mandarin. It feels good. Our company has worked together with many banks. I wish you will support us! Sure. Thanks. Hello! Are you miss poa? I am... your personal assistant. You don't have to speak mandarin. You know how to speak cantonese?! That's great. My nanny is a cantonese. We have been talking in cantonese since I was young. Hawk to base... hawk to base.. The security at the door is very light. What is your situation? I know her room number. We will do it at twelve. Got it, over! Mr., may I have your invitation card? I don't have one. Sorry sir, if you don't have one, you can't go inside. I am looking for a friend. I don't think you have any friends inside. My friend works in this company and she has a high position too. I am here to tell her that her boyfriend got in an accident. Go outside with me. I can't stand this place anymore. Okay. Kid, leave, don't mess up here. There are lots of important guests here tonight. How important? Salad, hey... Hurry... Don't mind him... - Salad. - What is it? Tart is in deep trouble. I know he is going to ask you to come talk to me. He is not a man! He should have come himself. He jumped to death. Is he dead? Not yet. He can never succeed... In anything he does. He landed on a fat boy... And he might have to go to jail. Then we must celebrate. There is one less loser in our society. How can you say such a thing? It didn't work. Who is that man? My boyfriend's best friend. What is your boyfriend's name? Tart. Why does he have such a funny name? Tart means take advantage, ready-made trash. He always sleeps around, he comes to me when he is tired, to take my advantage. I hate his name. He is a chicken and always treats me badly. I finally decided to break up with him today. Right, you don't need that kind of a man. Do you have a boyfriend? Couple years back I had one, but we broke up already. It doesn't matter, you're so pretty, you can always find a new one. I don't have the body like you. No! Boys in Hong Kong like girls like you. When I studied in england, they taught me how to be sociable. When you see an ugly man, you have to say he has personality. Ugly woman is elegant. I didn't mean to insult you, sorry... I am joking with you. You scared me! What's wrong? I am worried about tart! I thought you broke up with him? Yeah, but he has been my only boyfriend for the last ten years. I am really worried about him. That's right! Thanks. What a reaction?! Don't worry, I am not here to rape. I just want to have something from salad so I can give it to tart. Why? None of your business. Just give me something! Take it... leave... You gave him your necklace? - Yes. - Ok. This man is very rude. He is just as bad as tart. Why did you give him your necklace then?! Tart gave me that necklace thirteen years ago. And it is fake too. Don't cry, forget him. I am very sorry but I am not really that rude. Is that all you are going to give him? - Yes. - Ok. I am not going to go in anymore! How are you feeling now? Is it better? It's much better! I heard from my nanny that each bubble represents a wish. If a bubble does not burst from a long period of time, then the wish will come true. What wish do you have? My wish is to be able to find my mother. Don't you live with your mother? My mother has gone for over ten years already. Sorry! Let me show you a secret. Look. It's pretty. I spent a lot of time to make him this oxgyen box. He looks pity. Of course he is, he has no mother too. Miss poa. Call me ice. Ice my dad won't let me go find my mother. But I already made up my mind. I have to find my mother during this trip. Look, this was given by my mother's friend. This is her old address. It's hard to read. Mongkok... That is a complicated district, I think you will have a hard time finding her. Why don't you take me then? No! I'll have to take much responsibility. Sorry! Forget it! I think I can manage. Are you crazy?! There are security cameras! - Hide it. - Yes! Nothing. No one is here. Where did she go? Hawk to base, the goat is missing. Shit! Leave that place. Yes "She sits in front of the door alone with a lousy feeling." "Who can understand the mind of the girl?" That's right. "I am not happy. So I will just waste off my life." Quiet down for a moment. Asshole, someone locked up our gate. What? They also wrote many words on the wall. Who did it? I don't know, they didn't sign their names. Why did anyone want to write on my wall? It must be Mr. fat. Did you borrow money from him? Weeks ago I wanted to try the stock market so I borrowed... Couple hundred thousands from him. Why did you leave my address to him then? I was in a hurry. Hey, Mr. fat? I am wah. Who do you think you are now? I am wah. Mr. fat, you know me, stop talking like a woman. Sorry! I got the wrong number! Let's go. Where are you going now? To go find Mr. fat. I will wait for you... At wang fa. Get your ass over here! Let's go. Why are you so happy? I can't find your grandmother now! Do you know that if we go back now, we won't have another chance ever again! I don't know, why you always cause so much trouble! Hold it. You have to cover me, wah! I am warning you, don't ever borrow money from anyone again. If not I will beat the shit out of you. How dare you want to beat me when I am in such sad mood. You are so cruel. Okay? Not bad. - I know her. - Really? Are you the girl that was with salad?! Yes your cat is really pretty. It is a dog. This place is filled with bad people, why do you come here? I am a bad girl too. Really? Where is salad? She is a good girl. She went home to sleep already. Something bad will happen soon. That's okay, I like it. Take care yourself. She looks very pretty! Give me a chance, okay? - Who is she? - How about salad? She is stupid that she dumped me. I don't know her! - Are you sure? - Yes. Have you dated Mr. fat? The fat scum is always late. Wah, are you going to take up tart's debt? He is alone, get him! He is alone! We can fix him! I am not going to pay! Asshole! I am just helping you to spend your dirty money. How dare you come back and ask me to pay you back? Want me to kick your ass? I should just kill you right now! And use your body fat to cook. I hope you are just kidding?! - Have I gone too far? - Yes take a look of yourself! Why the hell do you have a girl tattoo... On your fat stomach? Call yourself the boss?! He is the boss! Because of my boss today, I will let you go! Don't mind him! Boss, am I right? No! I told you many times. You have to be polite when you are talking to the elders. We are all working in the under world. I will let you go this time because of the kind Mr. fat. Get out of here. Where are you two going? Leave if you don't want to get beaten up. Leave... Get back! Who you two think you are? Who said there are only two? Wah, I will let you go this time. Forget it, I don't want to owe you anything. I'll ask her to tell you when I'll pay. Come here... I will come back another time. Come here! I'll give you my hair instead. Go! Get lost, fat ass. - Thanks. - Your cat is very cute. It is a dog! Are these your friends? No, they are all deaf. Deaf? Why did they help us? I used hand signs to tell them that the fat guy laughed at them and called them deaf. That is why they are mad. You are very smart. Girls are good at stirring up troubles. How can I say thank you to them? This way. Like this?! This way. Thanks, we have to go now. You guys have to leave now? What do you want? Can I sleep over at your house tonight? She looks very pure, but she is open in fact. Okay, we are two of a kind. I really have no place to sleep tonight. That is it? Then... Help her then. She did help us once. Okay, I will help you then. Want to eat something? Run! Kill him! Go around to the alley. Run, take her with you. Okay... This way! Hey! Kill him! What happened to your hand? Wah. Stop running around, wait for me right here. Boss, are you okay? Go get them. Stop running... Kill them! Mr. fat. What are you doing? Killing someone? No. Stop! Director, who are these people? Sorry! Mr. fa. What are you doing here? Shut up! Get out! - Are you okay? - I am okay! - Let's go... I can't! - Why? Go find that girl! Why? I want some fun tonight. You guys do have the guts. I was about to sell her to a whore house. Why are you treating the men... So hice? What do you want? Tart, if you don't pay me back the money tonight, I am going to beat the shit out of you! You are going to kill me! It's only money, you don't have to be so mean. Wah, this is none of your business. I am a very fair guy. Take the girl with you and leave tart here with me. No, I am not going to leave my friend here. Good, I like you. You really value friendship. What do you mean? They really look after each other. If you have guts then take out a deck of card, who ever gets the smallest card will get the ass kicked, okay? How dare you say such a thing! Boss, take him outside and feed him to the dog. Wah, why are you doing this? Okay, let's see how much friendship does it have between you two. Pick a card! Show it to me! Yours is an Ace. Give me the bat. Why did you hit me? I hit the smallest. Why didn't you say so earlier? Again! Sugar, I was trying to tell you not to pick this card. Do your eyes have problem? This is the biggest card. I hit the biggest this time! Again! I get hit everytime I pick a card, I quit. Good. Kick his ass. What is going on? Who called the police? Did you call the police? Non of your business! PC 2503, someone reported to the police, saying that the movie shooting location is being disturbed. How is it now, over? PC 2503, someone reported to the police, boss, I think he is real. What are we going to do? Go now, I will take care of the rest. Thank you wah. Let's go! Go get him. Are you happy now? I am lce. My name is snow than! Let me take you home now! I really have no place to stay! Well, I helped you once. There is no room for you! I can sleep on the floor. What is it? Don't be scared of that dog! It has heart problems. You don't believe me? Try it. Hey! You see. Stop bluffing. It will be dangerous if you stay here. I used to get up in the middle of the night and rape someone. Here? No. Where is tart? He is fine! Well, go to sleep. Go to sleep. Goin... This is for you. You look very good. Grows in the dark, very good product. Enjoy it. By the way, this is ultra-thin. You are in deep shit, my mom forces me to... You won't, because you are a good man. You're wrong! I am the worst man on the earth. I mess around in mongkok. I sell pirate vcd. I sell girls to prostitute house. This is because you never got chance to learn. You are right, I never got to learn anything. If you let me change you. You will become a nice man. Come on! I used to study in england's best school to become a lady. Are you sure? If you did study in england you wouldn't have messed around... In a lousy restaurant. You don't believe me? Why should I believe you? You will soon find out. Good night! She told me she was tired, so I left. After that I went home and sleep. I only find out this morning when I got the call miss poa is missing. The security guard said that a strange man came... And talked to both you and miss poa. I think you made a mistake. He is my boyfriend's buddy. He came to tell me to go back to my boyfriend. What is his name? His name is wah! I am sure he has nothing to do with this. We suspect that miss poa is kidnapped. Because four workers... Were knocked unconscious yesterday. And their uniforms are missing too. We suspect that they dressed up as workers and kidnapped miss poa. If they did kidnapp my daughter, they should have to contact us today. I think so. So, you're under protection round the clock. All your phones are over heard. I only have this daughter. I don't want you to lose any leads. It will squash you. Look, am I stupid or not? You want me to let you go?! Sorry. I can tell that this is my asshole's underwear! Good morning. Has he left already? He is sleeping in the next room. He didn't sleep with you? We just met yesterday. Don't be shy! I am very open minded. I think you have misunderstood, we are just friends. I came back with him because I had no where to stay. I am not hongkie. Are you from the north? I am from Shanghai. Then you are from the north! Shanghai is north of Hong Kong. How long ago did wah break up with his girlfriend? Don't mention that slut again! I hate that slut! I always want to kick her ass. You don't like her? Of course, she never shows any respect to my son. She screws up my son's mind. What do you mean?! He becames a nut case. That is our slang. So you don't understand. Aunt, my name is ice. I'd be appreciated if you can stop calling me from the north. Ice? Ice-cream"s lce. Ice is Margaret really pretty? Shit! Prettier than a pile of shit. Size 32a with an ugly face. Although her name is Margaret, she is rude. Aunt, you are humourous. You have rhyme going with your lines too. I'm a well-known singer in mongkok, fei, the babe. Fai, the babe? Yes, when I was young... I was so pretty that... They used to call me babe. Later they call me aunt. They will call me grandma soon. How many people do you know in mongkok? All of them! Have you heard about a Shanghai woman called Manny? Manny?! I am thinking... almost there... almost. I don't remember. Oh no! I am running out of time. She sent me an address before. But when I went there yesterday, the building was gone. No time? Where are you going? Back to Shanghai. Back to Shanghai? Who is this Manny anyways? She is my mother. She left Shanghai twenty years ago. I do have some image of this woman. Really? Yes, she lost to me in mahjong. You shouldn't go, you have to stay here and find your mother. You can stay here, I don't mind. Let's have breakfast first, then we will go look for your mother. We have to find her, okay? Okay. Can you wake up my son for me? Am I really handsome or not? Salad, you came back? Come on, take off your pants. I am Mr. fat. Where am I? Shit gutter. Okay, I will take a shit too. When will you leave? Your mother will take me to go look for my mother. Yes my goal is to find my mother. Yes asshole! Congee with pig's intestines. It's good for your intestines. I am going out with ice later. You like my mother now? You are something! Go brush your teeth before you eat. Brush my teeth? Are you for reals? Even kids know that they should brush thier teeth. Go brush your teeth... I go check on him. I want to talk to you! You scared me. What is it? I like that girl with big eyes. She's great. Why don't you go for her? No way, she is salad's friend. So what if they are friends? - No. - No? I have to brush my teeth now. Why? I don't want her to find out when I kiss her. Get out! Too much! Why do we brush our teeth twice a day? It's bad for the teeth. Donel I have brushed my teeth. Where are they? They must have forgot about something. What did you forget? Wah, I was cheated. He said he would make me to be a star. But the truth is he just wanted to sleep with me. Come back then. What is it? We can't be like this. We broke up already. I mean that you should come back to Hong Kong. Don't be so mean. I was joking with you that day. That was not a joke to me, you know. What do you want to know? My little niece wants to find a person. She used to come here to visit you. When? Couple years ago. What is her name? Manny. - Manny? - Yes. Do you have any idea? On the left side of her face there is a mole. She looked nice and spoke shanghaiese. How do you know she has a mole on the left side of her face? I was not blind 10 years ago. She always came to me at that time. And sometimes she didn't pay too. Has she come here recently? She hasn't been here for a long time. I remember that her life was a tough one. She has lots of problems and worries. She was not able to live with her husband. She has a daughter but she can't see her. Mr. chan, can I find my mother? From this sign, it's showing something bad but with luck. Maybe. You never know. Remember nothing is impossible. That is all I can say for now. This is for you. It's good! Let's eat. Who is the chef? Bitch! You are a lucky one. Abalone... What a filial son! Of course! Come, sit down and eat. Aunt, let's eat. It's you! I thought you went to Taiwan to be a singer. Not singer! A striper may be. Let's eat. - Hello! I am Margaret. - Hello. This is my daughter-in-law ice-cream. Mom, how can you say so? Just kidding. This is salad's friend. I am ice, not ice-cream! Come, sit down. Why do you have to explain to her? No! But that is the truth. Haven't you heard of a song, "my heart have to move on". Yes, it's sung by Maria Jackson. - Am I wrong? - Whatever. "My heart has to move on." Can you not be like this? What?! I just want to sing. "My heart has to move on." Try it. "My heart has to move on." Come in here with me. - You don't like my song? - No! - Let me tell you... - What? Something is wrong with her brain. Right, that is why she went to be a striper. You are right! She has brain cancer! Really? She just fainted a while ago. How can you believe her? How come she is still alive? You should be smarter than this! We are all friends, - just let her stay for a while. - No! I promise you that I won't sleep with her. But you will be hungry then! You can eat ice-cream! I want to! But... I don't know how. Drug her. You don't work in the kitchen often, right? Yes if you want to tie down a man, you have to know how to work in a kitchen. And know how to sleep with him too. Wah is very serious about this. Can you? All girls can do this... You don't have to lie about it. I think... You only had one or two boyfriends before. Who told you? How many boyfriends did you have before? I over a thousand. When did you start having boyfriend? 15! I am 24 now. You must have hundreds of boyfriends a year?! You have to treasure today! She is going to have a new boyfriend tomorrow. I know. Are you leaving? Let me tell you, she is a good girl and leave her alone. Is your girlfriend still mad at you? All I need is to walk on the street and many girls will come after me. I don't need her! It's useless to fight within yourself. If you like her then start praying. Hope the lord will change her mind. I don't think... That will work for me. The lord loves everyone and takes care of everyone too. All you need is promise to change and won't follow the devil anymore. I only want to have a woman right now. It's useless to bluff with you. Lord, I love salad very much. I have been with her for many years already. Maybe I like to fool around with girls a lot. But I do have feelings for her. If salad comes back to me... I don't mind that. But don't tell anyone else about this conversation. If you do then you will get it! I am not joking with you. If Salad will come back to me if only apologize... I don't mind, really! Okay? Please lord, give me a chance, help me! Amen or whatever! Lord, you are the greatest. If you are really this good, can I have a hot model instead? Or a naked woman will do too. Why don't you open the door? Salad, I know you will come back to me. Don't touch me or I will call the police. Move! Are you looking for me? No! I am looking for wah! What is going on here? Wah, you are in trouble! The police said that you are a suspect. A suspect of what? Remember that night you came to look for me and I was with this miss poa. Miss poa? The one with a long red skirt. So what?! She is missing and the police is treating it as a kidnapping case. They think you have something to do with it. I am a suspect? Yes salad, I am here. How come you are here?! Your dad is looking for you everywhere. Let's go talk inside. What are you guys doing?! This is wrong. - Yes. Get out of here. - Go tell me later. I think you should go back. No, if I go back I won't be able to come out again. You will cause a lot of trouble. Just don't tell them my dad is rich. Why not?! You can buy them up with millions of dollars. No. I don't want them to treat me nice... Because of money. But they do live in a very old house. I should buy them a new house. Let's go find your mother first. I am not going back in this couple of days. I have to find my mother by all means. I want to live in a Hong Kong life too. Hong Kong life? It means lower salary. I heard that even late at night there are still places to go in Hong Kong. Congee in shatin, roasted goose in shun chen... Let's go tonight. I want to go out with wah. Okay... okay! Teenagers should go out a lot. Asshole! Mom, are you calling me? Yes! Take ice out to have so fun. Lots of fun, understand? Okay! Are you obsessed? Shut up! Why don't you go too? Okay! I know that you will miss me. I want you to die! Come on, give me a kiss. Open your mouth... Where are we going? Let's go eat roasted goose. Why are you holding me so tight? We are here to have fun! You don't have to drive so fast. How is my hair? Very good. Let's go. Stop holding onto me! You have so much fats. I love to hug you. Come on, let me hug you a little longer, okay? Okay! But take off your helmet first. Take it off. Okay! What are you doing?! I kill you asshole! I heard tart treats salad bad. Yes! But they just broke up, so tart just wants to cheer her up. I think tart is bad. Salad should dump him and never talk to him again. You are so noisy! That is none of your business! Okay, let's talk about you. Do you like Margaret? No, I am just worried about her illness. Have you noticed that she does not like me. What? She doesn't like me. A little. If you don't like her... Then don't give her a reason to misunderstand. We are just friends. Friends? Girls are hard to be friends with their ex boyfriends. If you continue to treat her this nice she will think that you still love her. She will change soon. Change? Will you change? Will you comb your hair nicely?! Lift up your pants so your underwear won't be showing again?! And stop calling your mother... A slut? Why should I?! Will you want me? So what if you want me! Your boyfriends all only last for few days. By the way, how many boyfriends did you have before? One... couple. Couple?! What? Who told you to make fun of me? Tell you the truth, you are pretty handsome. If you change, you will be great. You like me? If only you change! I don't think you can make it. How about it? L... youl I I... you. I don't think you will. Salad, if you... won't talk to me anymore, I will jump to death! I don't care! If I... die, you will have to pay for my funeral. No way. If I become a ghost, I will... come back to haunt you everyday. Don't worry, you will never become a ghost. Okay! I will jump to death! Go ahead... do it quick! I am going to jump! Hurry! Tart. I know that you love me. Come on, give me a kiss. I really want you to die! Let me help you. Salad, don't. Wah, come give me a hand. Come on, break it up. - Don't be so angry. - You asshole. Don't mess around anymore. Give me a hand. Okay! Are you crazy?! Why did you kick him down? Tart... tart. What did you do that for? I ook! Salad is touched. Are you okay? Leave them alone, let's go! Where are we going? I will show you some goldfish. Tart... "My love... my darling" salad, will you forgive me? Come back up first. Where did x's girl go? She went to mongkok to look for her mother. Someone must have taken her in. Did someone get to her before us? If that was truth someone should have called to ask for money. I think the people who took her in are nice normal people. Is Margaret! Her boyfriend is wah, he is pretty well-known in mongkok. Let's ask for her help! Margaret, I thought you went to Taiwan? I came back long time ago! Stupid! Come over and drink, would you? Why not? Hello! Help yourself. All of you have to stay here and drink with me. Can you help us... Get wah to come out to talk some business? - Wah? - Yes! Tell him to go to hell. I was only gone for a couple of days and he got a new girl friend who is tall and has big eyes. She always carries a dog around and acts like she is so cute. I don't know what is so good about her? Is the dog white? How do you know? Her name is llce. Sometimes, I feel like I am a goldfish. Like a goldfish with two big eyes? Like a goldfish with big belly? You are mean! Can you stop hitting people? I am serious. Okay, I will listen to you seriously. I feel like that I always live like a goldfish. People think I live in a pretty and happy world. But a goldfish can't even have a dream. I will be traped in a little box... Until I die. What do you do in Shanghai? Are you some kind of animal in a zoo? I don't live in a zoo. I think your life... Is really good and meaningful. We have to worry about money everyday and you call that life? Your life at least... Will have happiness and sadness, ups and downs. But for me, my life is like a straight line. No ups or downs. Sometimes I don't know why I should continue to live my life. But you guys are different. You guys have to fight for your living. When you make a lot money you will be very happy! No way! I wish I have a lot of money. I just want to wake up and go out for fun... And sleep... You be like tart then. Tart is different. He goes out and gets sad... And goes out and sad... This kind of life... You will not be able to stand it for 3 months. Wah, I... What?! When are you going back? L... can I not go back? Yes! But there are lots of things to be done first. Will you do it with me?! Tart is right about you, you are open. You ask me do I want to do it with you?! So what? We will make arrangement again some other time. I think you like me. Me?! You are trying to trick me, aren't you? How are you going to explain this! L... yes! I do like you a little. No way?! How will you like... A rude guy? A scum who speaks foul language and loves fighting? You will change if you like me. It's very hard! Will you change? Can I not change? Do I have to change to make you like me? Will you change? Do I have to change to make you kiss me? Will you change? Are you going to kiss me? Will you change? Are you going to kiss me? Will you change? Are you going to kiss me? Change first. Kiss me first. Change first. Kiss me first. How can you change your living... If you can't even change yourself?! If you won't kiss me how will I have a sex life?! You are sick! But if we do get together I really want to know what my position on your list. You told me that you have thousands of boyfriends and I don't really buy that. I think you have about fifteen. Five?! 15,0007! Where are you going?! Ice! You are bad! Police! We are from the organized crime bureau. What's up? We think you are connected to a kidnapping case. You have the rights to remain silent! But everything you say can be used against you in court. Who did I kidnap? You know! What is taking him so long? Get to work! Is he trying to scare me? Let's go back first. Ice! My girlfriend got kidnapped. She is in that car... I may accept your demand. But if you touch my daughter, you will be dead! Almost got them! We just need five more seconds! They are pros. I think we have one of their men. We can make him tell us the truth. Are you guys sure about this? How come the kidnappers never mention anything about it? Mr. poa, I think they have a good reason. If they did mention it they might blow their cover. What should we do now? Wait! Mr. poa, a woman is looking for you! I don't want to see anyone! She said that she is Manny. I want to meet this old friend alone. Mr. poa. You... I am Manny's good friend. Why did you say that you are Manny? If not I won't be able to see you. In the past two days, your daughter was with me. Continue. My son took her in when he saw her alone on the street. She was just like Manny in the past. I have a question in mind. When she told me about Manny, I knew that she is Manny's daughter. Where is Manny? Dead! She died ten years ago. Before she died she told me. She made a mistake, that is leaving you. I didn't tell this to your daughter. I don't want her to be sad. That is why I lied to her. I took her to chen and he told her a lie too. I just want her to go back to Shanghai with ease. I didn't know so many things will happen. You mean that... your son has nothing to do with the kidnapping? Of course! Before Manny died, she wrote you a letter. After she wrote this she died. The letter was stained with her blood. I should have sent this to you long time ago. But I was hoping that some day, I can read this to you. Do you want to hear it? Go ahead! My love, I was wrong. I should have never left you and ice. I love you! In this world, you are the only one who really loves me. But I won't get to go back to Shanghai to see you anymore. If I get to choose again. I will choose to stay with you and ice. Goodbye, Manny. Okay, I believe you. Go outside and wait. Sorry to bring back you old memory. How is it? He is so stupid, he believed everything I said. But I don't think this is right. Wah didn't kidnap ice. I think the police will release him soon. I don't care, they better release my son now. My love, I was wrong. I should have never left you and ice. I love you! In this world, let go of me... let go! I am going to scream! Asshole! Oh no! I am fired! I told you that we shouldn't lie to them. I really do know Manny but only this letter is fake. You are so stupid. We have to find ice to save my son. Who knows ice lived in your house? Margaret. Let's go! Someone wants to see you. Can I know who you are? You don't know him? Mr. poa has something to tell you. Thanks! I only have this one daughter and I love her very much. I wish to take her back to Shanghai safely. I understand. They don't have evidence to charge you. They have to let you go after 48 hours. That's great. I really didn't kidnap your daughter. Then who kidnapped her? I have thought about this for a long time. I can tell you the truth. I don't know. Listen to this and see if you can find any evidence. Nothing? It's not turned on yet. Dad, I am safe. I got kidnapped. I know you will save me. Help me say hi to aunt fei, wah, and his girlfriend too. Sorry! We got it this afternoon. What is so special about it? Nothing. Aunt fei is my mom. I saw her. But why my girlfriend? My girlfriend is called Margaret. But we broke up already. - I don't want it. - Thank you. Hello! Why do you have to lock her up here?! You should have lots of places to hide her. This is a good place! No one can guess it out. You have a nice house. I am scared! You guys should go now or I will call the cops! Sit down! You will get millions by leasing this house to us. Isn't this better than being a whore? What are you doing? Help! Get down. Quiet! Here we are. This is the address in asshole's address book. We will get kidnapped too if we go up like this. We are not scared and why should you? You are my girlfriend. I am afraid that you will get raped. I get raped by you anyways. So there is no difference. But I will... Get killed! Forget him! Let's go. I want to break up with youl! Stop talking about break up. If you say it again I will commit suicide. I will count to three, one... Boy boy, tell us... If your owner is here! Coming! Margaret. Margaret! Aunt! Margaret, forgive me. What is going on? Aunt... I am sorry, I was wrong. It's my fault. I finally know that you are a very good girl. Be quiet! I shouldn't stop wah from seeing you. Please forgive me! Aunt, it's okay, please get up. Aunt, I have to go out now. Can we talk about this later? Do you know that my asshole got arrested?! I know... no! I don't know, really? The cops believe that he is the kidnapper. You are a member of his gang too. Me? Do you know that if you are convicted, you will be sent to China and be executed. There are lots of cops down there. Sorry to bother you, bye. Don't go! Let me do it! Let me show you some of my kung-fu. Open the door! Don't go! Let's go! Salad, how come you are here? Ice got kidnapped upstairs, call the cops. No way?! Take me to go see it. No! There are four persons upstairs. No, there are five of them. What did he say? Sir, they said that someone called for cops upstairs. Close down the streets, call for back-up. Let's go see what's happened. Yes sir! I hope the information is right. Go check it out. Be careful. Handsomes, you guys can go now. I have bad memory. I won't remember your face. Really? Get it a shot. You guys want to rape, no problem. Rape me! But don't kill me. Ben! Something is wrong! The cops are coming up. Go get the car. Why don't you answer me? You guys are not interested in me? I don't like old woman! Fix him. You again?! I will cut you! Bite him... His mouth got shut up. Bite his ass... Bastard. Bitch! Be quiet! Wah! Sorry! I didn't mean it. I was going to hit him. But I didn't mean to hit you. Wah, I love you very much, do you know? I know... I know. What do you know? I know you are lying. Let go! Your breast is going to suffer. Tart... tart. Salad. Are you okay? Salad, I am dying. Don't die. Before I die, can you promise me one thing. Say it. The money I owe you... Can you forget about it? No problem. Can you put... $200,000 in my account too? I will try! If you can do that I won't die then. Thanks salad. Asshole! - Cops! - Get down! Help... Drive... - Help! - Drive faster! What are they doing? Mr. fat! It's you? Sorry! Move back... slowly. Did you hear me?! Hurry up. He is about to catch up. Faster. - Hurry. - Let her go. Wah. Wah. Be carefull let go! Let go! Be careful. Wah, be careful! Be quiet! I can do it! Asshole, this is not your fault, don't be like this. Just because you don't have the skill. Don't say that. This really is not your fault. If the road was a little wider and no car was around. And ice had some jumping skills, then things wouldn't have turn out to be like this. Yes, if she moved a little, everything would have been fine. - Right, she should have moved. - Yes! They got away, ice would be more dangerous. Of course, that is why we should receive at least half million. Right! Say something, would you? Please! I want some too! You, maybe next time! Okay? Her liver is shattered, and is bleeding inside. Her liver might lose its fuction. So what should we do? We have to do a liver transplant. Is there any liver that is right for her? Lots of people have been waiting since last year. But still not match for them. No matter how much it costs, I must find her a right liver. It does not have to be a whole liver. If someone donates part of this liver, and be accepted by her body, then it will do. I will donate mine to her. Okay! But we have to do a blood test first. We have to check if her body will accept it or not. Doctor, count me in too. What is the result? The report came out. In this group of people, only wah and tart fit the operation. Really?! I am a fit too. My liver is good, I will donate it to you! Two million dollars an once! But let me remind you, this operation is dangerous. I have decided that to donate mine. I have decided! Mom, don't be like this. Thanks! But even if you save my daughter. It doesn't mean that I will let my daughter repay you. I understand! Awsome... awsome! You are awake? Doctor said that you should be awake this morning. Dad, how did I get back here? You got injuried. Wah donated part of his liver to you. The operation is a success. I was in a hurry to go back to Shanghai, so I got a special airplane to bring you back here. Where is wah? After the operation he has got a complication. He was not awake when we left. How is he now? I have called to check. Doctor said he will be paralysis for life. Forget about him! Your birthday is coming up. I will host a party for you! No, I want to go see wah in Hong Kong. Mr. poa! Has miss poa done changing yet? She refuses to change. Go out first! Come on, change your clothes. The guests are here. You have to go say hi. I will introduce a good boy to you. I don't want it! Change your clothes. Hello! Hello! How are you doing? Just to say hil I just want you to save me. The guests are here, come down. Stop laughing! You've changed! You don't want it? I think you looked better before. What do you want from me? Do you have a girlfriend? No! But I miss Manny very much. Do you feel that I do look like her a little? Really, you do look like... Elizabeth Taylor. I am happy to see them so happy together. Let's get married, okay? Okay, if only you buy me... A big house! A big problem! Why don't we just make love every night? No way! Hey, I accidently touched you, you don't have to be so mean. I tell you, I'm actually a tough guy. Let's take it outside. You are useless, you can't even beat a kid. Salad, are you going to dump me again? No. If you work harder from now on I will like you more. Me too! Even if you become a flat chested woman... I will still love you, salad...
