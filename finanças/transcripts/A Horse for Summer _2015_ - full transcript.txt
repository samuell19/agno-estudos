( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) ( HORSE NEIGHS ) ( LAWNMOWER APPROACHING ) Hey, there, pretty lady. Hey. You know, this suits you. The fresh air, the sunshine, working with your hands. Leaving the city is the best thing we ever did. Well, I wasn't sure at first, but-- What a great life for a teenager. Hey, why don't you come with us? Maybe, just an hour? Well, you know, unless you got a drawer full of cash that I don't know about... taking care of the ranch, it's on me, you're the one responsible for making sure that God's not disappointed in us. Oh, right... Uh-huh. And you do a good job. Thank you, honey, but I'm not sure that's how it works. We're gonna go straight to the shop after church, okay? Hey, come on! We're gonna be late! ( HORSE NEIGHS ) Okay. ( CHURCH BELL TOLLS ) Hey, thanks for coming. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Mrs. Walsh, Sarah, it's nice to see you this morning. Your sermon was wonderful. Ah, thank you, I just wish more of our neighbors would take time to stop and listen. Well, don't take it personally. Times are tough. Well, it's in these challenging times... that people need to find comfort in their faith, you know? But they just don't know what to do right now. Just trying to keep food on the table. Yeah, that's true. Bye, thank you. Oh, by the way, thank you so much for the donation of the clothes to the mission. Well, you're welcome, it was nothing, just some old merchandise that hadn't sold from the store. It was a lot more than that. It's hope, it's comfort, it's people in their darkest times. Knowing that there's somebody there that cares. Most of it was out of style. I wasn't sure anyone would even want it. Pride, it's the last thing folks are willing to give up. ( CHUCKLES ) So, where's that husband of yours? I've missed him these last few Sundays. He's so busy working on the ranch... but you know Kent, he won't hire any help. I'll be over right after dinner, Miss Walsh. Come for dinner, if you like. Don't want to impose, ma'am. We'll have plenty. You look nice today, Sarah. Thank you. Better start getting used to that, you're growing up to be a very beautiful, young lady. She is, and I keep forgetting she's a teenager. Jonathan's a good kid. He-- he really is, and he loves the horses... so I've asked him to come by and I'll give him riding lessons... in exchange for him doing some chores for us around the ranch. Well, that's very nice, he deserves a break. You know, for somebody to pay more attention to him. Well, besides, Kent could use the help. Though he'd never admit it. Well, you never know when an act of kindness can change the course of a troubled soul. ( POLICE RADIO CHATTER ) Come on, let me go! Settle down, you're in enough trouble as it is. Hey, hey, hold up! Mom, tell them you didn't do anything. Don't make this worse than it is. She'll have a chance to talk to the judge. Baby, just do what they say and stay out of trouble, okay? Please don't-- please-- Let's go. Mom! Child Protective Services will take care of her. Mom! ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Have a good day. ( DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ) Well, our only customers of the day. Mom, can I ask you something? Sure. What's this? It's a permission slip. There's a freshman class trip in September and all the kids are going. Great. San Diego? San Diego? It might as well be to the moon. Sweetie, I don't think that we can afford this? Your father has not-- It's just-- you tell me I should-- All I do is work and study. I never get to hang around with any of the kids from school. You're right. How about this. We'll talk to your dad tonight after dinner. See if we can work something out... okay? Okay. You take that. We might as well lock up. I don't think anyone's buying anything today. Okay. ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Mom, why is the plumber's van here? Oh, no. Dad's gonna be in a bad mood. Maybe we should not ask him about the permission slip. No, I promised I'd talk to him. And then he just walked up to me. Okay. All right, thanks. And he pulled a knife on me. Okay. I didn't know what to do. I really didn't know what to do, so-- All right, all right, I got that. I ran and then I called you guys. Thank you. All right, thanks. What's the story now? We have a stolen necklace and some earrings... parole violation. She's not gonna be home any time soon. Ouch. Hey! Why can't I stay here? I've been on my own before. I can take care of myself. Oh, I'm sure you can. But the judge seems to think otherwise. The court has ordered you to be placed with relatives until your mother's case is heard... and sentencing is determined. I'll run away. Only other choice is foster care. If there are no relatives to care for you, the court will place you with a family. No, that's not an option. I have no living relatives. At least, none that I know of. Your mother has a brother, a Kent Walsh... somewhere in Arizona. We're attempting to locate him now. Well, not a single sale all afternoon. What's the plumber doing here? After you left this morning, everything went wrong. Dakota let himself out, which of course made all the other horses start going crazy. Kicking and raising up a stink. They broke a water line, flooded out half the stalls. Oh, man... Honey, we don't have it in our budget for that kind of repair. Okay, we'll think of something. We always do. I wish I had your kind of confidence. It's not confidence, faith. Honey, everybody is delinquent paying their boarding fees. Chet Barker is three months past due on both his horses. Now if he doesn't come clean and get up to date on his account, I don't know how we can-- No, no, no, not Dakota, he's-- Dakota is the one that caused all this trouble today. Well, I'm glad you're finished for the day. We can have a nice, Sunday family dinner... talk. I'm gonna go check on the plumber. Okay. Here we go. Ooh, now that looks great. Well, thank you. Hey, hey, hey! Dear Father, thank you so much for the many blessings that you've shown us. And thank you for the opportunities you've given us to share your love with others. Amen. And... I'm thankful for my healthy family and our beautiful home. I'm thankful for the time I get to spend with the horses. Right, I am thankful that the plumber will let us pay overtime. Amen. Yes, can we eat now? Amen. Yes, thank you. Yes, okay. Well, hey, Pastor Bob is really missing you at Sunday services. Well, you tell Pastor Bob that some of us have to actually work for a living... to put money in that collection plate. Well, you know that the Lord will provide for our needs, as long as we have faith. Are you gonna make Dakota and Bella leave? Honey, Mr. Barker... he hasn't paid in three months. So? Well, we can't just be-- Well, hey, listen, we'll figure something out, okay? Dakota and Bella aren't going anywhere, at least not anytime soon. This is not a good time. Well, it seems there's never a good time anymore. ( SIGHS ) Here you go. Thank you. Sure. Uh, and there's that. What's this? Well, Sarah's school has a class trip to San Diego planned for September. $400? Are they kidding? $400? They can't expect-- Oh-- Honey-- There's no use hiding this from her. She's old enough. She's old enough to be taken seriously. We owe it to her to at least consider this, okay? Can't you see it's important to her? This is what I see. And-- and there's lots more where this came from. Kent, I know, okay? Sarah knows, too, she's a smart girl. She knows what we're dealing with. We forget, she's just a kid. This is an important time for her. She should be out making friends and learning about the world. Not stuck in the store all the time. We never knew where our next meal was gonna come from... or if it was even gonna come at all. I don't want Sarah to ever have that fear or that embarrassment, or you. So, if it means missing a school trip... we'll tell her teacher that we need her to work with us on the ranch. There's no shame in just saying that we can't afford it. No, I don't want to do that! I don't want people thinking that I can't provide for my family. I don't want Sarah to know the feeling of people... looking at her with pity. Okay. Who's that? That's Jonathan. It's Kathy Taylor's son. Now, if you'd come to church every now and then, you'd probably know who he is. He's in Sarah's class at school. Kathy's had a rough time since Will left... so I told Jonathan I'd give him riding lessons... in exchange for him doing some chores... around the barn. Those riding lessons help keep this place open. You shouldn't be giving them away for free. We're not in a position to be charitable, not now. I thought he could help you. I don't need help from anybody. ( PHONE VIBRATES ) If he can't pay, he's not welcome here. I actually don't mind cleaning the stalls. Get to spend time with you... and the horses. Are you excited about the class trip? I can't go. It's okay, I might not go, either. I'd rather stay here with the horses. We can work with them together. Okay, well, I'll call you back when we decide. Thank you, Mr. Walsh. I'll wait for your call. What? Your uncle and his wife, Teri, they have a daughter your age, Sarah. She helps out in stables, and works at the family store. You two should get along great. Yeah, I doubt it. That was a social worker from the New York Police Department. A social worker? Eva has been arrested again, but serious this time, Summer's gonna be placed with a foster care family... if they can't find a relative for her to stay with. Well, when does she get here? She can stay in Sarah's room. No, no, no, whoa, whoa, whoa. I didn't agree to anything yet. I told the social worker I would call her back as soon as we decided. Decided? She's family. Summer has been in and out of trouble since she was little. She could be a very, very bad influence on Sarah. Or Sarah could be a good influence on Summer. It'd be nice for Sarah to have someone her own age to hang around this summer. We're barely making ends meet as it is. Last thing we need is-- The last thing we need is to turn our backs on someone who needs us. It's not the kind of man you are. I don't know what kind of man I am. Just know that I don't want to end up like my dad. I want to be able to provide you and Sarah with the security... that he could never provide for me, or Eva. I could go back to LA, get my old job back. You guys could stay here and I'd come visit on the weekend. No, you were gone all the time. We never saw you. And this would be worse. What should I do? I can't tell you that. Only you know what your heart is telling you to do. I'm behind you, no matter what. What about Summer? You did the right thing. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Mr. Walsh? Yes, ma'am. I'm afraid she's not very happy with the idea of being here. This is a one-way plane ticket. If things don't work out, Summer can come back to New York. We'll make alternate living arrangements. Wo-- won't you be staying? I mean-- No, I have a return flight in an hour. We find it's best to leave the families alone to adjust. Summer, this is Mr. Walsh, your uncle. He has my contact information if you need to get a hold of me. Remember what we talked about? About how important it is that you make this work out? Good. Thank you. Uh, thank you. ( ENGINE STARTS ) You can't make me stay. ( SCOFFS ) What am I supposed to call you? Mr. Walsh? Uncle? Sir? Kent, you can call me Kent. That'll be just fine. Okay, you know, if you give it a shot, you might actually like it around here. Don't count on it. What do people do around here? Well, most are, you know, ranchers. Horse people. For fun. Well, working on the ranch doesn't give you a whole lot of time for fun... but I suppose there's rodeos, dances, church. I won't be going to that. Look, you know what? We're not gonna try to take the place of your mom. But while you are here, you will act like a member of this family. So if that means going to church, you're going to church. You never cared about my mother. You never even knew about me, did you? None of this was my idea, okay? My wife, Teri, your aunt, she's the one that wanted to do this. Okay, she thinks this is our calling. Is she one of those church people? Both my daughter Sarah, and Teri, are very excited for you to be here. Do you go to church? Me? I'm Sarah. Summer. And this is my mom. Hi. Oh, I am so glad to meet you. Uh, if it's okay, you'll be sharing a room with Sarah. I'm used to sleeping on the sofa. Okay, well, if you need anything, anything at all... you just ask... you're family. Well, I guess I'll let you get settled. The bathroom's just down the hall. Dinner will be ready in 15 minutes. So... would you like to help me? Okay. Okay. ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) You're late. Hon-- Well, around here, we show up for din-- Honey! Let's make Summer feel welcome. She's our guest tonight. Well, tomorrow, you can start pitching in. We're happy you're here. After dinner, Sarah can take you out and show you the stables. Dear Father, we're so thankful for this food that you've provided. Thank you for bringing Summer to us. ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Your dad hates me. No, he doesn't. He just works too much. He doesn't mean anything by it. He reminds me of my grandfather. Well, our grandfather. You met him? I always wondered what he was like. He, uh, didn't like me much, either. Did you even know about me? Dad doesn't talk about growing up. It makes him sad or angry or something. He just says right here, right now, that's all that matters. So, uh, who's this? This-- this is Dakota. He is a flirt. Isn't that right, boy? ( NEIGHS ) Will I be able to ride him sometime? Dakota's an energetic boy, maybe we'll start with Bella. She's much gentler, and when you're more confident-- Well, what if I'm-- I mean, what if I'm not able to ride a horse? I'll teach you. There's a lot of new things to learn while you're here. Go easy on her, Kent. This cannot be easy for her. All of this is new. It's a strange place. For heaven's sake, we're strangers. I don't trust her. Do it for me. Now that's not fair. Oh. Fine, but if she gets out of line one time, I mean one time-- Then you will treat her with kindness and show her the right way. Right? Okay, you ready? One, okay, you're almost there. Ugh, Summer! It's not funny. Admit it, I'm just not meant to ride a horse. You can do it, just remember, grasp the reins, then the mane, but don't pull, okay? ( SOFT MUSIC CONTINUES ) Come on, Bella. So, do you like her? Yeah, she's really sweet. [SARAH] I think she likes you, too. It took a while, but I think I'm finally used to a horse. I did it, I finally rode a horse. You did? You should have seen her, Mom. She was a little slow getting started-- Agh! But once she got in the saddle, she was a natural. And Bella was so gentle and patient. I have no doubt. Hey, you two go get washed up, dinner's almost ready. Mm-mm. Mm-hm. What's for dinner? I'm starving. Oh, let's see, we have rack of lamb and risotto with truffle oil and lobster. Mm, I love mashed potatoes and meatloaf. Me, too. You know, it is so nice to see Sarah having fun for a change. Sarah is a natural. She's a great teacher, just like you. She had Summer up in that saddle and running around the paddock in no time. You know, I think summer actually really had a great time. I think she took a shine to those horses. Oh. What? Just sounds like you're starting to like the idea of having Summer around. Don't get ahead of yourself. It's only until Eva gets out. Oh... really? Shall we say grace? Dear Lord, bless us as we eat this meal, bless this food... and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen. Amen. So are you two going to youth group? Would you like to go? It's cool. Cool, church? Sure. There's music, movies, games, Pastor Bob is great. We talk about school, all sorts of things. I wouldn't know anyone. You know me, and I'll introduce you to Jonathan. Is that that boy you're always telling me about? He's a good guy, you'll like him. Oh, hey, look at the time... why don't you two eat quickly and then you can get cleaned up... and I'll drive you to youth group. Hi, Sarah. Hey. Come on, everyone's here. It'll be fun. You'll see. I think I'm just gonna stand in the background for a while. Okay, take your time. Come on. ♪ If you are ever alone ♪ I will help you carry on ♪ If you are ever in need ♪ Then you can count on me ♪ If there is ever a gray cloud ♪ I won't let the rain bring you down ♪ If your skies are anything but blue ♪ I'll sit through the storm with you That was great. Maggie, Riley that was great, wasn't it, huh? If the skies are anything but blue... I will sit through the storm with you. What wonderful lyrics. I know you're all excited about the movie tonight... but I'd like to have a brief conversation about something... I've been thinking a lot about, and that's friendship. Welcoming a stranger, or standing by someone's side. How many of you remember what it was like to be the new kid in school? Or on a sports team, or a church? Remember how lonely that was? Would any of you just get up in front of a bunch of strangers and sing a song? Or do a dance? Or maybe even give a speech? Would any of you walk up to the new kid and welcome him? Why not? Sarah? Because we're shy. Because we think we're shy. The definition of shyness is the state of being reserved... timid, shrinking away from people. I'm gonna go find a restroom. I'll show you where it is. No, stay here. I can find it. Okay. As Christians we can overcome shyness simply by relying on the Holy Spirit. Take second Timothy 1, 7. For the Holy Spirit, God's gift does not want you to be afraid of people... but to be wise, and strong... and to love them and enjoy being with them. See shyness is a form of pride, the fear of what others may think of us. So if shyness is fear, fear is the opposite of faith. But in the Bible, it says we don't have to be afraid of what others think of us... as long as we know what we're doing is right. It also says that if we strive to live a Godly life... that we may not even be liked. But all is not bad, because if we're motivated by God's love... then we can reach out to others, and accept them... and appreciate them. If we put the emphasis on, on others then we get to live in freedom... and self sacrifice, and a love for others. Does everybody understand what I'm trying to say up here? Oh, and this is Jonathan. You're right, he is cute. No, I didn't say it-- what I mean-- Oh, look, it's time to start the movie. Um, not quite. Hm? Wish me luck? What for? You'll see. Okay, good luck, I guess. Uh, whatever, good luck. And before we start the film, I have one more surprise for you. I have no idea. ♪ I may not be strong enough but I never tell a lie ♪ I may not be brave enough but I can treat you right ♪ I know I can move mountains and I can shake the world yeah ♪ If I stand my end would you be my super girl ♪ So what would you say if I tell you I miss you baby ♪ If you need a talkin' talk to me ♪ Promise I will be faithful I'll be yours until we drowned ♪ I'll be your king You'll be my queen ♪ Under the ground ♪ So what would you say if I ask you to take my hand ♪ Baby just give me a chance so I can show you ♪ I can be your superman ( CROWD APPLAUDS ) ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Oh, hey, I thought we decided you'd go to the store with us today. I'm sorry, I think travelling must have caught up with me. I bet, well, stay in today and go with us tomorrow then. After work, we could have another riding lesson. Okay, if you don't go to the store today... your Uncle Kent will expect you to help in the stables this afternoon. It'll be fun. Sure, it will. It'll be great to have some help with the chores. We usually start off with mucking the stalls... but since you're new, we're gonna start off with feeding. ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ) ( MUSIC FADES DOWN ) ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Eva Dean... you got a phone call. A call? Yup. It's right here. Hello? Mom? You shouldn't have called. I hate it here. I've made a lot of mistakes. I'm gonna be in here for a lot longer than we thought. Find something to care about, Summer. Why? Everything I care about gets taken away. [GUARD] Time. Baby, don't call here anymore. Don't end up like me. I'm sorry. Watch your hands. Bella looks a little puny today. She didn't eat this morning. Probably her arthritis is acting up. Hey Jonathan, you miss your dad, don't ya? My mom and him, they fought all the time. Sometimes-- sometimes I thought they were gonna kill each other. But, it didn't mean he had to leave. I understand that. Look, I grew up in a not very loving family... so I know what that can do to a kid. I'm not, I'm not trying to make excuses for your father, not at all, but sometimes... sometimes it can seem like the only choice you can make is the wrong one... even if it's for the right reasons, does that make any sense to you? Yeah. I'm sure your dad loves you, and I'm sure he misses you. It's just tough sometimes. Why don't you get those pellets inside, we got a lot more work to do. ( DOG BARKING ) ( CAR APPROACHING ) Where is he? Whoa, Cathy, calm down! I'm not gonna calm down. Wh-- what's going on? I don't-- You're making my son work for free, and it's not right! No, it's not like that. Oh, why don't you tell me what it's like, then. Teri thought that Jonathan would enjoy being around the horses. We know things have been tough since Jonathan's father-- Teri's so quick to think she's better than the rest of us. We don't need your charity. It's not like you don't have problems of your own. I know, everybody knows in this town that you're about to lose this ranch. Mom! That does not give you the right to take advantage of my son. He's been lied to enough and he doesn't deserve this! Mom! No, Jonathan, maybe it's best if you go home with your mother. Go! Let's go! [CATHY] Now! I just wanted to do something nice for Jonathan. Well, maybe it would've been better if you just stayed out of it. You know, no good deed... That's never a good enough reason not to try. Where were you? You were supposed to help out today. I was tired. There's no room for tired on a ranch, okay? If you want to stay here-- That's the point. I don't want to stay here any more than you want me here. Well, you can stop doing us a favor any time now. Kent! What? She... Look, you act like there's nothing wrong around here... like you're not about to lose this ranch. Dad? Wait, it's not the way that Cathy made it sound... and you shouldn't be listening to-- Look, you're a loser... just like the rest of us. Just like my grandfather. You have no idea what you are talking about. I do my very best for my family! Okay, I never look for the easy way out! Not like my father, and definitely not like-- Say it. Say it! Not like your mother. [SARAH] She's gone! [TERI] What is it? What's wrong? She's gone. Summer, she took her stuff, I looked everywhere and she's not here. I'll call the police. Wait, no, don't-- don't call the police. Why not? The last thing she needs is the police looking after her right now. Listen, we are responsible for her. We can't just let her run away. It's my fault, okay? I'll go find her. I'm coming with you. No, no, you stay here. Okay? What if she comes back? The best place for you is to be here waiting for her. Okay? I'll find her. I'm sorry. ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) Good morning, Kent. Pastor. You look like you could use some rest. Uh, my niece, Summer, she's gone missing. I've been looking for her. Yeah, I know. Teri informed me. Listen, I called some of the men from the congregation, and they're here to help find her. I, I couldn't ask you guys to do that. I'm sorry, I, I-- Listen, as the Lord's shepherd's, sometimes our work literally involves finding lost sheep. Yeah, she's just a scared, young girl, Pastor. I'm not sure a shepherd is what we need right now. I understand. Well, all God's children are lost at one time or another. I, I'm sorry, I, I don't mean, you know-- You just stay here, you look exhausted, okay, let us go look for her. God'll lead us to her. Trust in Him. Thanks, Pastor. Okay, get some rest. They're gonna help out. She couldn't have gotten very far. She doesn't have any money, she doesn't have anything. You should probably get some rest. I, I can stay by the phone. No, I, I couldn't-- I couldn't rest. I'm gonna go out to the stables. Wait, Dad, no, wait. Hey, honey, why don't you stay here with your mom, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. I know that. Mom prayed for her. I did, too, if you don't mind. Of course, I don't mind. You want to come help me feed the horses? All right. I'm really sorry about all this, honey. Want to go check on Bella first? Sure. Dad! Oh, my gosh! All right. Here we go, come on Bella. Come here, come here. Easy girl. Summer. Summer. You okay? What is the matter with you? Half the town is out looking for you? Oh. I'm sorry. Shh. We're just thankful that you're okay. You didn't say goodbye. Your dad doesn't want me around. That's not true. Yes, it is. He made that very clear. But I don't have anywhere to go. My mom doesn't want me. I'm sure that Ava is looking forward to getting out of jail... getting you home, and getting everything back to normal. It's probably all she thinks about. She told me never to call. Sarah has to go back to New York. I'm calling the social worker first thing in the morning. No. We both know you're not going to do that. She'll go into foster care. You can't let that happen. It could be the best thing. For you maybe, but definitely not for Summer. How can you even consider this this? Honey, foster families, they have experience, they have the court's backing... we have no idea what we're doing here. And we agreed, okay, if she gets into trouble, she goes back. Honey, you are not being fair. This is all new to her. You know how it is when we get a new horse to board... how it takes a while for them to get used to the surroundings, the routine. She's scared, and she's lonely. When you got so angry, she didn't know what to do, how to act, okay? Will we get to see Bella and Dakota, Daddy? It's been a long time. I really hope we get to see them. We'll see. There he is, there's Dakota. Mom, can I ride him today? You don't have to do this, Chet. We can figure something out. We talked about this. We could sell my car. No. Wait here. Hey, Chet. Dakota! Emily wait! I apologize, Chet. I-- I'm sorry for all this. I just, you know, you're three months past due... and now with Bella and her medicine I can't... You don't owe me an apology, Kent, this is all my fault. I never meant to put you in this position, it's just... I'm a proud man. I'll find someone to take Dakota and Bella, just give me a few more days? ( SIGHS ) ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) Mr. Barker doesn't have the money. What's wrong? It's Chet. I can't stand to see a grown man so defeated. He just looks so lost. Honey, I told him he could have a few extra days, okay... but that's really not what it's about is it? What's going on? It's Summer. We're all she has left in this world now. Ava's situation is only temporary, okay... she's gonna be out in no time. And then Summer can go right back to her. No. No. Ava told Summer never to come home again. She told her never to call her. ( SIGHS ) I, I can't stand the thought of Summer being all alone. I couldn't bear it if Sarah ever felt that way. Sh-, honey, you know I would never let that happen. You know that. Summer's gonna be crushed when Dakota goes. They have really bonded. Are you sure we can't just let him... I was really counting on Barker bringing his account up to date. We have no extra money. I know. Every dollar counts right now. I know. Dakota and Bella can stay... for now. I'll tell the girls. Hello? Hey, this is he. Well, there's my handsome husband. You never get dressed up, what's the occasion? I gotta swing by the bank, talk to Marshal about our loan, see if he can do something. It's nice to see Summer helping out with the chores this morning. Yeah, well I had a long talk with her last night... after I told the girls that you said Dakota and Bella could stay for now. I explained what's going on, and how everybody just needs to pitch in. Summer really gets it. Things should be different now. I hope so. Bella's still not eating. I'm really worried about her. I'll check her out today when I get back this afternoon. Okay? Okay. Mr. Walsh, thanks for letting me see Bella and Dakota yesterday. Of course, Em. Emily, Mr. Walsh is busy. Hey, listen, I'm, I'm sure that Dakota was very excited... to see you too. Okay, Em? Really? Absolutely. Can we come see them again soon? You can come any time you like, how's that sound? Good. Okay. Come on, Emily. Let's let Mr. Walsh be on his way. Thank you. Well, don't you look road hard and put away wet? Is everything okay? Jeez, Patsy, my wife told me I looked handsome this morning. And... I guess there's just a lot on my mine. I remember when you used to have to fight to get a table here. How's business? Well, you know, things are hard for a lot of folks... and eating out is kind of low on their list. Well, I understand that. Good days are bound to come around again. Now all we have to just keep up the faith. Excuse me, hi. There you go. Okay. I'm really sorry, I thought I had a 20. Oh, well-- That-- here this is all I have. It's all right. It's okay. Are you sure? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Excuse me. Thanks. Well, you know, I wanted to tell you, you did a nice thing... you know, bringing your niece here. Oh, well, you know, my wife, that's all her. Well, how's the youngun' fitting in? Life on a ranch is a lot different than what she's used to in New York. Yeah, it's a challenge to say the least. Oh, I heard about your run in with Kathy Taylor. Isn't that a shame? I know that Jonathan was so good with the horses. Well, you know, Terri, that was Terri's idea, too. Well, now I know you got a lot of things going... and you think that, you know, it's gonna be rough for you, but you'll do it. God never gives us more than we can handle. Well, I'm gonna have to trust you on that one. No, no, you trust Him. Well, thank you. Oh, here, here, your-- your friend is back there, table 11, yeah. Okay, thank you. Oh, listen, I know you got a lot of things on your mind... but that's because you're doing it all on your own. I mean Terri, she's working the store, and Sarah's... You know what I mean. I don't want you making any wrong decisions... because you haven't looked for help in the right place, hmm? Yes, ma'am. Thatta' boy. Thank you, Patsie. Hey guys, I'm going to the store for a bit. Do you want us to come with you? Oh, I can show Summer how to stock the shelves. Well, thanks. That's okay, stay here, enjoy the afternoon. We'll take Summer to the store tomorrow. [SARAH] Okay. Okay. Bye. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) You know, us country folk don't take too kind to city folk, especially headhunters. Kent, good to see ya. How are ya? Look at you... tan, handsome and broke. Glad that I got that call, surprised, though. What's the matter? All this fresh air finally getting to you? Well, it turns out fresh air is a little more expensive than I thought. Mrs. Walsh, how are you? Hey, great. How's Sarah? Fine, thanks. And it's Terri, remember? So how's that horse of Mr. Barker's doing? He's beautiful. Thanks, John. You know that is one great horse. And you will let me know if he ever wants to sell Dakota, right? Of course. I-- I'll remind my husband. Good to see you. Oh, thank you, Patsy. Thank you. Hope you don't mind me ordering for ya. She's the best. Listen, I was glad to get your call. I've been wanting to get you back to L.A. for a while now... get you back into the game. I know that this whole thing you got going down here... with the pigs and the chickens and all that, that was your dream. I thought I lost my best candidate. Well, dreams are a wonderful thing, especially if timing's on your side... and I'm not so sure timing was on my side here. It's getting, it's getting more and more difficult to keep the ranch going. So, I was, I was just wondering if it would be, you know... maybe possible to get me my old job back, or something, something different. Let's get serious, let's talk business. A guy like you, you're always in demand. All you gotta do, give me one call. Boom, I'm here for ya, Arizona, I'm your guy. You sign with me, I'm gonna get you your old job back... if that's what you want, but I want to get you something better. Kent, what are you doing? You're not a farmer. You ready to make some serious money? Why didn't you tell me? Honey, I'm handling things the best way I know how. Really? I didn't want you to worry. I thought we were a team. We were, honey-- we are, it's just-- Uh, is everything okay? Everything's fine. Go get ready for dinner. No, they should know. They should. Guys... I'm behind on the mortgage. And the bank won't wait anymore. We might lose the ranch. We have enough money to get us through maybe the next month... after that I'm gonna call the bank in the morning... see if they'll give us more time. But will they let us stay? I don't know. I want you all to be prepared. Okay, if they don't give us more time... then we may have to move back to L.A. I may have to get my old job back. I missed you. Sarah barely knew you. It was tearing us apart. That's why we came here in the first place, to build a life... where you didn't have to be away from us so much. To remember what matters. There may be no other choice. There's always a choice. I'll miss Dakota and Bella the most. What are you talking about? You heard your dad, you guys are gonna lose the ranch. No, no, he's gonna call the bank tomorrow. Everything will be okay. You all will go back to L.A. ... And you'll go with us. That's not how it works. They'll send me back to New York. But your mother's still in jail, you would go to foster care. I'll figure something out. Where are you going? I'm just gonna go get a drink, go back to sleep. You're all dressed up. You don't know what it's like... bouncing from one stranger's home to another. I can't-- I won't go back to foster care. Are you gonna run away again? No. I know somewhere to get some money. I'm coming with you. No. It is better if you don't get involved. Just go back to sleep. This is for family, right? Come on. ( ENGINE STARTS ) I shouldn't have let you come. ( DOGS HOWLING ) Summer, why are we at the church? It's better if you don't know. Stay in the truck, keep the doors locked, promise? I'll be back soon. Summer. I need you to stay in the truck. If things go wrong, I don't want you to get involved. Well, your dad is about to lose the ranch. You're gonna have to give up the horses and move back to the city. And I'll have to go to foster care. I can't do this. Fine. Stay here in the truck. But I'm doing this. Summer, this is not right and you know it. It's too late for me to turn back now. ( DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ) ( OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING ) What are you doing? Summer, I've had enough with this. We cannot do this. That's it, I'm telling my dad. I didn't want you to come. I didn't want you to get involved, but you insisted. You're a part of this now. I'm a part of this? Really? 'Cause I didn't know you were gonna steal the money. What do you think your father's gonna say when he finds out... that you broke into the church with me? I stayed in the truck. Do you really think that's gonna matter? Do you really want to hurt your mother like that? Of course not. I don't want to hurt anyone. Summer, I don't want any part of this! It's too late for that. Are you okay? Where are you going? Hey, girl. What's wrong? ( NEIGHS ) ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ) Uncle Kent, you have to come quick, it's Bella! What is it, Summer? What's the matter? I'm not sure, it's something with her leg. What? With her leg? Yeah, with her leg. Okay, let me see. Come here, girl, come here, girl. How you doing? Come on. Oh, yeah, okay, okay, easy girl, easy girl. Easy girl, easy. Honey, call Chet Barker. Okay, tell him to get here immediately, tell him to bring his checkbook. Okay. All right. She's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay, sweetheart. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, Dr. Anderson, how are you sir? So sorry to call you so late. We have a problem here, an emergency. It's Kent Walsh, yeah, one of Chet Barker's horses, Bella... she seems to be pulling up lame. Could you get here immediately? Nah, I really appreciate that, sir, thank you so much. Uncle Kent, will she be okay? I hope so. Yeah, it's hurting her bad, isn't it? Yeah. Chet Barker? No, he doesn't have any money. Well, that's great. There goes that little bit we saved up for the mortgage. Well. Well, I might as well not even call the bank to ask for an extension... if we don't have the money. I don't know what to do. That's great. Easy, girl. It's worse than we thought. Well, it's just her arthritis, right? Looks like Bella's fractured her elbow. Fractured her-- are you kidding? How? I don't know how she could have... Can't tell for sure, arthritis made her unsteady on her feet. Maybe she fell in the stall, or was kicked by another horse, but... Well, isn't there anything that we can do? I've given her an injection, she'll be comfortable for a little while... but I'm afraid you've got a decision to make. There are some expensive treatments we can try... but in the end it's just not fair to let her suffer. Hey, don't worry about it, honey. Doc. I ask for a little bit of time on the bill, if you... Sure. Here, Uncle Kent. What is this? I found it at the door yesterday, I forgot to give it to you. Doc, I don't know if this is gonna be enough... but if it's not make sure-- I'll make sure I get the-- the rest to you in a heartbeat. I'm sure it'll do. I'm sure it'll do. Would you like to stay for some coffee? That's very kind, but I'm afraid it's been a long day... for this old, country doctor. Thank you, though. Thanks, Doc. [KENT] Easy, girl. Good girl. Hey, that was Pastor Bob, someone broke into Fellowship Hall... and stole the money for the mission trip. What? Yeah. It was supposed to be turned in tomorrow. You don't, you don't think that Barker-- I mean he was just saying the last couple days... he didn't have any money at all. He was considering getting rid of Dakota and-- and Bella. You never know what someone's capable of doing when they're desperate. I mean that would ruin his life. That's a shame that the mission isn't gonna get that money. Oh, that's why Pastor Bob was calling, they're putting together... an emergency festival and bake sale for tomorrow... to try to replace the stolen funds. What are we waiting for? I'll get the girls. Okay. Is Bella in pain right now? Dr. Anderson's injection is keeping her comfortable for now. If we hadn't found her when she did... she could've suffered like that all morning. We have Summer to thank for that. What were you doing up at that hour anyway? Kent, it doesn't matter. What matters is we found Bella when she was in trouble in time for us to get her help. I couldn't sleep, and I didn't want to wake Sarah up... so I went down to say goodnight to Dakota and Bella. I'm sorry I forgot to tell you about the envelope. Mom, can we take our breakfast out to the stables to sit with Bella? Of course. There's really no choice, is there? The girls are gonna be devastated. I'll talk to the girls. I mean, it's a big responsibility taking care of horses... and that includes knowing when to stop their pain. I'm not really hungry. Neither am I. Will the injection help Bella? Supposed to, but it's only temporary. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have started to care. Everything I care about gets taken away. It's not your fault, it's just, this is what happens on a ranch. But it doesn't make it easier. Do you mind if I see Bella by myself for a minute? Sure, go ahead. I bet you don't understand why it hurts so bad. Do you, Bella? See that thing about pain... we don't always know why it hurts so bad sometimes... but I understand, I do. We're both dealing with pain. Mine's just a different kind that's all. I wish I could help you deal with your pain... the way that you help me with mine. ( SOFT MUSIC CONTINUES ) ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Hey, Sarah. Hey. Do you need help? Sure. Can you grab that, and, oh, wow, that was a close one. I've been baking. Hey, honey, are you coming? You go ahead, I'll catch up. Oh. Here we go. I'll grab those boxes, let me have these first... and that one, okay, it's looking great. Hey, look, there's Jonathan. Come on. Come on, guys. We can help you set up so the kids can go listen to the music. Thank you that would be great. Why don't you run catch up with Sarah. Can I, Mom? Of course. Oh, wow, where's the fire? Sorry, Mr. Walsh. It's all right. Billie Jean, isn't there something you wanted to ask Mr. Walsh? Did you have a question for me, Billie Jean? Would it be okay-- could I come over... and ride the horses sometime? You have a dollar? I'm just kidding. Of course, you can come over and ride the horses. Just have your mom give us a call and we'll set it up, how's that? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome. You're welcome. I'm sorry, she's been bugging me to ask you all week. I hope you don't mind. No, I don't mind at all. Seems like the horses have developed a little fan club of their own. How you been Kent? I been doing all right, trying to keep my head above water... horses fed, you know, that whole deal. We just have to appreciate what we have. I agree with you there. Could be a whole lot worse. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Here's Kent. Hi. You know, I've been thinking it's really sad to think... about all the problems that there must be in this world... to make someone make such a bad mistake, you know? Too many people try to do it all on their own... but they just don't realize that there's a better place to look for help. ♪ Crying selfishly ♪ Within one's self we can be free ♪ When we're faithful life flows so easily ♪ I wanna be graceful and give unselfishly ♪ And when I lose my place ♪ I'm reminded of God's grace ♪ When I fall apart ♪ Follow what's in my heart ♪ I'm so grateful for my daily bread ♪ So very very thankful where I lay my head I'd like to thank Pat Payne for entertaining us with his fine music this afternoon. And I would like to thank all of you fine people... for showing up today at a moment's notice... at the last minute, thank you so much. As you know, we had a little incident at the church yesterday... and our mission group was really counting on those funds to continue their good work. Well, in times like this we can sometimes become bitter... and maybe even a little angry... sometimes even harbor thoughts of revenge. The Bible even says an eye for an eye. Well, I say let's look at this as a blessing. We were able to put our problems away... and come together as a community for a common cause. I also ask you to find it in your hearts... to please pray for this person whose troubles... were so desperate that they felt the need they had to do this. Enough of me, you don't want to listen to me... let's bring Pat Payne back up to the stage... and please buy baked goods. And thank you so much. Thank you. ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) Hi, Kathy. Oh, it's so good to see you. You know what, I think I have a pie left, let me get it for you. No, that's not why we're here. I'm probably not your husband's favorite person right now... but well, Jonathan heard about what happened to Bella, and he was very upset. He was wondering-- we were wondering if he could come by and see the horses? Jonathon is always welcome, of course. Let me grab that pie for you. I insist you take it, it's Jonathan's favorite. Thank you. You're welcome. I, I never have any time to do anything special for him. I'm really sorry. It's fine. Oh, my goodness. I'll get the extra boxes and bring them in, hon. ( OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING ) Well, I guess I can cross off church festival and bake sale off my to do list. Oh, and country music, too. I can honestly say that is something I would've never seen back home. Well, it was nice to see how many people came out to help the church. You know what we have to do, right? I heard my dad tell my mom that he thinks Chet Barker might have stolen the money. What if they blame him? What if they-- Stop. Stop. You heard what Pastor Bob said, okay, they don't have any idea who took the money. And with the money that they raised at the festival, they'll probably stop looking. Summer, this isn't right. We have to tell them where the money came from. We can't. Don't you see if they find out that I stole the money... I won't just go to foster care... I'll go to juvie again. Probably for a while this time. Is that what you want? Of course not. Besides, look at the good that we did with the money. I mean your dad was able to pay the bill for the vet for Bella's treatment. Doesn't it count that we took the money... to help out in a bad situation? Summer, it was stealing. The reason why we did does not make it any better. Don't you see that? What you did, what-- what we did... isn't any different than what your mother did... and she's in jail, Summer. Look, I never-- No one ever showed me how much doing the right thing matters. I never had anyone like you, or your mom and dad. Where I come from no one gives you the time of day... much less helps anyone else. Will you at least just think about it? Can I ask you something? Mm-hmm. Do you really believe all that? What? You know what Pastor Bob said about the money missing from the church... about forgiveness, about praying for the person who ... Pastor Bob says most people go to church to find a way to deal with things... that happen in life, I guess to learn a better way to live. Faith teaches us forgiving is better than revenge. I'll find a way to give the money back to the church. I don't know how yet... but I can't change what I did... I can only try and make it right. What's going on? I'm sorry to have to come here like this. Is everything okay? No. I'd like to ask you some questions, sir, if that's okay? Yeah, sure. Mr. Samuels informs us that he saw your truck behind the church the night of the robbery. That's impossible. Mr. Samuels thought it was odd that anyone would be parked back there that late at night... so he took note of the plates. Are these your plates? Yes, sir. Yeah, they are. But-- Look, I'm gonna have to ask you to come down to the station... with me and answer some more questions. What the-- that doesn't make any sense. Pastor Bob tell them, you know-- I would never do-- They saw your truck there. That's impossible. There's no way. We had to tell the police. Kent, I know how much pressure you're under... and I'm so sorry that I wasn't there for you... in your... I did not do this. Why-- why won't you listen to me? I'm gonna have to ask you to turn around and put your hands behind your back, sir. Okay. Yes, sir. It's okay. Baby, just do what they say and stay out of trouble, okay? Please don't-- Let's go. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Wait! He didn't do anything. I stole the money. Well, Pastor Bob, do you wish to press charges? Sometimes people do the wrong things for the right reasons. Doesn't make it right. Officer Willis here, he's got a very important job to do. His job is to protect the community's welfare. And I have a very important job too, it's much different... my job is to protect the community's hearts. I know you girls are very sorry for what you've done... and I know you're gonna do everything... possible to repay the church. Look, I know what I did was wrong... and I know I don't deserve to ask you all for forgiveness... but this is my responsibility, not Sarah's. This is my fault. Not hers. Well, and I know that Patsy needs help with volunteers in the food pantry on Saturdays. Thank you so much, Pastor Bob. These two girls definitely learned a very valuable lesson... and you can definitely count on us to make sure that they fulfill their responsibilities. Absolutely. Sounds like an excellent solution. Thank you. ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) ( MUSIC CHANGES ) How many more houses do we have to go to? I don't know, Miss Patsy packed a lot of food. How much community service do we have left? Until Pastor Bob decides to-- well, you know... at least we're not like stacking chairs, or cleaning windows... like last weekend at church. At least we're outside. Yeah, let's just get this over with. [MISS DAVIS] Go away. We don't want whatever it is you're selling. Miss Davis, we're from the local church. [MISS DAVIS] What do you want? Um, um, we've got some stuff from the food pantry. Miss Patsy thought that you could maybe use some. That Miss Patsy, she always seems to know when a person needs a helping hand... through a bad spell, doesn't she? You girls can just put those things over there, it's fine. Hey, girls, thank you. I could use a good meal for a change. Oh, and tell Miss Patsy I said thank you. Tell her I'll make it up to her someday, somehow. It's nice to know we're helping, even if it wasn't our idea. Yeah. I can't help but wonder if things would've been different... you know, if there would've been someone there for my mom... the way that you guys were there for me. I don't know. Well, let's get going. Food's not gonna deliver itself. ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ) Mr. Barker says that we can keep Dakota... as long as we teach Emily how to ride. I don't know, I don't think your dad really wants me around. Summer, we're not the only ones who learned a lesson... when Pastor Bob gave us another chance. Besides, it was my dad's idea to let you stay. And you know what he always says, right here, right now... that's all that matters. I-- I think it's more of like a right here, right now, that's all that matters. Yes. Hands up if you agree. Boom. ( ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING ) I'm gonna go check on the lamb, okay? Okay. You and me are buddies, right? Don't get me wrong, I miss Bella, but-- ( NICKERS ) Mm-hm. You and I, we're a lot alike. A little wild... a little unpredictable. I'm glad you agree. It's gonna be hard to say goodbye to you. ( SOFT MUSIC FADES UP ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( CHUCKLES ) Good boy. You ride him like a pro. What's wrong? You should be proud of what you learned. My mother never believed that I could do something like this. ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) ( CAR APPROACHING ) Somebody you want to see? ( GASPING ) Summer!
