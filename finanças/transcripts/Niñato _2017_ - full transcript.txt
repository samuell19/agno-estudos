I'm on my way, Jessy. I couldn't get out earlier, sorry. I'll call you when I'm nearly there, OK? Sorry, I'm running a bit late. Start checking the equipment. I'll be there as soon as I can. Ni-?a-to is back! Ni?ato's back again! Auri. Mum? Mum? Auri, I'm here, you can go now. - Nighty-night. - Nighty-night. Good morning! Morning everyone! Your clothes are on the bed. Come on, kids! Can you bring them here? What? Can you bring them here? I'm going to turn on the light. Come on, Mimi. Come on, Oro, up you get. Rise and shine! Check him out. His eyes are shut. Come on, open your eyes, see what's going on! Look, he's taking off his pyjamas with his eyes shut. Look, Mimi! - He always does that. - Yeah? Does his willy always wake up before he does? Yeah. That doesn't go there! You're gonna lose your undies, then you'll say, "Can't find my undies." Come on. Put them on, they're over there, where you chucked them. Hi! Anybody home? Hey! You can't turn around now! Come on, please. Look, undies. Come on, it's Thursday. Not long to go. Just tomorrow, then it's the weekend. - Do we stay home, then? - Yeah. Home? No, I mean tomorrow there'll be only one day of school left, then it's Friday, Saturday... I see what you're getting at... come on! Mimi, listen to me, don't say no. Do it now, please. I don't want to get angry. Here they are. Did you just grab her titty? I've been dribbling here. Yeah, I can see that. You dropped something else. Socks, knickers, thermal trousers, trousers... and I'll slip this T-shirt on so you don't catch cold. I don't want to go to school! - Take your top off. - No. Mimi, don't start! Take your top off, please. I'll think about it. All right, do it yourself! And hurry, don't be late! Daddy! Daddy! Hurry up. Stop messing about. Daddy! Daddy, come here! No, I was just there and you didn't listen to me. Why should I help you now? Hurry up! I'm losing my patience. Get a move on, OK? We're a team and each one has his own responsibilities, sweetheart. - OK? - I don't want to... Mimi, do you dress me in the mornings? I've been here for ages waiting for you to get up, damn it! Come on, this isn't fair! Take off your pyjamas and put on your knickers. Look at Oro! He's younger and he gets dressed by himself! No, sweetheart, I've been waiting for a while. Come on! You don't need my help, you always get dressed on your own. That's right, sweetheart. Mimi, don't start, OK? Take off your PJ bottoms, put on your knickers, thermal trousers and socks. Now what? Getting dressed on your own is your responsibility. - Everyone gets dressed on their own. - We're not babies anymore. Listen to him. Look at Luna. I'm not playing games. - Leave me alone! - Now what? Now what? What a pain getting you dressed! I'm going to turn off the light! Oro, you'll catch cold. Mimi, I'm going to get really cross! Please, please! Get dressed! - Help me! - Help you with what? Look at Oro, look at Luna. You're going to make me cross! Now we put yours, then mine and then Oro's... But why? Stop it, Oro. Oro, eat it up or you'll get messy. Careful with your clothes, they were just washed. Come on, kiddo. Eat it up, man, because you're... - Can I have some water? - Yeah. Come on, eat up. I'm on the slope... with all my gang. Till we die! Against the current with my ear, only for the brave. On the slope... You hang by a thread... Till we die. If we keep up the pace we'll be on time. - Hello. - Hi. Auri, my slippers? Er... aren't they there? My house slippers? Yes... I might have washed them. You're kidding. It's been raining so they might not be dry yet. Shit. - Wear Dad's. - It's all right, I won't be long. All this lot is for washing. OK, I'll pick it up. Is this for washing as well? Ni?ato! - How's it going? - Good, did you bring me that? - I've got 15 CDs for you. - 15? I've got an order for four or so... - Ten Euros each. - Ten Euros? Cool. Four, five, six, seven... Nine, ten, eleven, twelve... That makes 15. You've got 15. - I'll leave them here, OK? - Cool. Busy, huh? All right there? Totally snowed under. I can tell you're busy! What do you want to do? Share the file as Clan L?rica Salvaje. I'm Ni?ato from CLS, I introduce myself, right? Auri, can you turn it down, please? Who's picking up the kids? Eli? No. It's 3.30pm. Don't worry, Auri. I know what time it is. It's 3.25pm. When are you going to work, Eli? Now. Until 10.00pm. Finish this. You can't see the video, man! I asked Mum to cook some rice for supper, Luna still has a bad tummy. - See you later. - All right, thanks. See you. - Mum, will you get me some Tampax? - OK, anything else? - That's all. - Fine, see you later. Give my girl back to me, sucker! Or I'm gonna dip you in itching powder. Is that how it ends? Yep. David? In fact, it should have ended sooner. Because it's a terrible song! You what? It's great! Don't start with Black Sabbath now and blow up the amps. Why don't we make up a song? I'll play this thingy... The one that plays this tune. All right? Let's go home, I'm freezing. What shall we do? Stay for lunch at school? Christ! There's the Headmistress. And the Head of Studies. What's Oro doing? Isn't he at home? I wish he was. What do I know Hold this, Mimi. Bloody hell! - What about Luna and me? - Wait there, please! OK. On a rainy day you can't keep your sister, your cousin and me waiting at the school gate for 20 minutes. We're the last ones here, Oro! You know what I like best, honesty, I love honesty. OK, next time I won't ask you. The barrels? Have you looked at the book? Or just answering to make me mad? Rather than actually doing it, this is more about making me mad. - Much more. - Dad. I don't know how to. Read the whole exercise. Now tell me, what's 1,275? Think about it. What does each operation mean? What are you doing? Think about it. I can help you. Actually, I'm helping you. What I can't do is think for you. - Dad. - Yes, kiddo? I don't know how to. You're not reading it. All you do is read to me so that when I read it myself I give you the answer, but you have to find out for yourself. It says what 1,275 is. And how you found out the weight of the six barrels. You've got it all there. I just don't know, David, help me. I'm helping you, Oro, what is it? 975 litres, what is that? Well... it's water. From where? Water from where? Water from... - It's right there. - Large cans. No, it's not the water in the barrels. From... Well then... from... from the reservoir. I'm surprised you're acting like this. But I don't really care. We both know what you're up to. So go ahead, keep daydreaming like that. But don't say "I don't know", and expect me to do your homework. I can't do your homework while you sit there daydreaming. This is the one he'll have to take... This one. The one who's been killed. What are you watching? A really weird film. Taking Chance. And what's it about? He has to escort the body of a dead soldier back to his homeland. And then to the village where he was born. To deliver the corpse to the family. - What war is it? - Iraq. We don't know yet, until we don't... - It's just started, right? - Yes. - Well, I'm off. - OK. - See you. - See you. Shall I start the film? What's up? - Hi there. - Hi there. How's it going? - Chilling. - That Monday feeling. - I'm going to do the same as you. - Are you? I'm going to do what you do. Take my kid home for lunch. Really? - I'll come with you. - Yeah, sure. We're trying to cut costs. School dinners are expensive. Cause me and my wife are working less hours, then there's no way. It's not enough Well, you have to walk it. But hey, it's no big deal. Actually, it's good, no need to go to the gym. It keeps me in shape. And then for next term... - No more school dinners. - Right. Cool, we can have a little walk at lunchtime. One more guy for our lunch club. - You do it too? - Sure, he comes as well. You pick up Yasin at lunchtime to eat at home. He's going to take his kid out of school at lunchtime. - He used to eat there? - Yeah. So I'll ask at work so that they don't give me shifts... - Mornings... - Only night shifts. Sure, that's brilliant. We'll have our little walks at lunchtime, then. Things are a bit tough. I can buy food for a month with the dinner money. Yeah, pretty much. Actually, that's about it. Yeah, pretty much so, because it comes to 112, 100... We didn't even consider it because... - Per month. - Incredible, huh? We never even considered it because we have time and we've got three kids. Just do the maths. We'd work just to be able to pay for school dinners. We'd rather not work those hours and let them eat at home. And in the afternoon... We have fun, spend time together. At lunchtime... When David can't pick them up, I'll do it for him... Sure, that's what we're here for. No worries. Let's help one another. Come on, love. Oro, Do you realise how much time you're wasting? I have such a headache. You've had quite a few lately, haven't you? - Are you sleeping OK? - Yeah. - Will you be quiet? - We've got tests coming up. - What about next term? - Will you be quiet? You shut up. OK, sorry, you're quite right. But he was like, "yeah, but no..." and I was trying to focus. - Then do this. - We'll talk when you're done, OK? - I won't talk. - Using Morse code. I love it! - Will you just leave me alone? - What have I done? - He hates me. - Luna, leave him alone. - Cut it out! - OK, I'll stop. Leave him alone or he'll never finish. Don't look at me! It's just so... - Look, Oro, that was you. - If you won't even talk... Oro, I'm just like this, looking at you, and you... Leave him or he'll get like the Hulk. - Look at the state of this. - Yeah. My nut! My nut... - Will you just shut up? - OK, I'll shut up. And stop whistling. - What is wrong with you? - You'll go over there on your own. All this messing around! Hey... - Hey, Oro! - Enough of this nonsense! That's enough, right now! - Come on. - No! I won't go! Can't she even look at you? Can't she look at you? - And can't she... - Not even smile at you? And then she'll tell me to shut up because she needs to focus, then she should shut up too, right? - She's concentrating. - When did I tell you to shut up? - Five seconds ago. - Five seconds ago? - Yeah, five seconds ago. - I just asked him five seconds ago. - Just listen to me, she... - Why should I listen to you? If you want to listen... Will you listen to me? Will you listen to me or won't you? I've been listening to you all afternoon. - Now it's all my fault. - No, it's mine, Oro. It's mine. Is it my fault, Oro? I'm not going to finish it! You know what? It's not going to be a problem for me, right? It's not my problem. It's yours, son. I don't care, I'm not doing this homework. Careful, it might break. Fuck. He's like, "Don't talk to me." - Right, but it means he's won. - No. Yeah, he won't talk to you. He did the same thing to me as well. He manages to do it and you just stand there and say... He gets the upper hand by shouting at you. Just like that. It's true, and on top of it, he's got away with it. And he's like, "I couldn't care less." "I'm totally over this." At the time... the pressure and all that... I don't know. It's not easy, it's hard. Because... In my case, it's crossed my mind a couple of times to... to give him a good spanking. - Me too, but... - Like "calm down". But then I thought of Luc?a. It worked. When it happens I do sometimes think about... Yeah, sure, you know what? I should react that way sometimes. You try your best. Otherwise, it might be you who gets spanked. - You're like, "Oro, calm down." - No way! I mean, an intimidating and firm tone, but... - Here. - Yes. I mean not by yelling. It's happened to me twice, yelling at each other. That's why I said using space and... I'm not talking about the shouting. I meant... A scenario where he yells... I yell, he yells louder, so I go up nice and close. "If you ever dare to yell at me again..." - Yes, whatever, but... - "Go to your room." From this distance. Not me yelling from here and you're the one in control. - I get closer... - I've already done it. Now just go... And you've got him there. You got him, because the other way around it's what you say. And on top of it all... I swear, next time we might not be able to control ourselves. Give me a kiss, Oro. Hey! I got so much flow, it slips away! You got a mike, it's mine. This is for girls, boys, lesbians and gays. The rest of you, keep far way. Hey! I got so much flow, it slips away! You got a mike, it's mine. This is for girls, boys, lesbians and gays. The rest of you, keep far way! This is chewing gum. Nandi give me a loop, something to chew. When Ni?ato spits, he splashes you. From Guadalupe to Mozambique. When it gets rough, I say my rhymes. BDP-style, the sky's the limit. That crew, they can't even spread the flu. If you're the king, I'm Prince Felipe. Oh, Daddy, I'm skint, only got this pen of mine. Fuck the police, I ditched that pose. I'm looking for a mike, my rhymes are looking for you. You're looking for this kinda flow. We'll do something together. All right. Call you later. Are you gonna be at home? I'll give you a bell later. Hun. Love you too. Silly billy! Kisses, I love you. See you. David gets to choose the winner, I mean Mia. Rap challenge. Arriving at your village, You might think I'm blind... If you do that at a rap challenge you'll get kicked out. Ideas fly for messengers. No fighting is my style of fighting. Mercenaries, they take sides. Are you with them, or are you digging me? My sword is made of bamboo. I have no reasons to commit seppuku. Old School, Ice Cool, New School. My haiku will knock you to the ground. I follow my own Bushido rules... But you can't go for a rap challenge and then use my rhymes. - OK. - You're supposed to write your own. - Where's the notepad? - I have to put it away. I'll sing whichever you want me to! No, I'll read my own rhymes. - Wait, come on David, sing. - Roll your cigarette and... My heart fills with satisfaction when I try to touch your soul with every song. I'm a bastard who could do with some shame. I don't like competition and I'm not afraid of it. If it was just about that, rap wouldn't exist, taking part in what made hip hop this big. I get more of a kick out of Star Wars than Scarface. I think what I say... so think what you do. You'll get to choose the sauce with your steak. Will you drive just like Mad Max? I travel Star Trek style. Looking for you through a thousand false doors. If I found you, it's 'cos I've dodged traps. Ringing on your doorbell so many times. They sell baskets for the price of a suitcase. I'm in now. Is that song new? What? - I didn't understand. - Was that a new song? No, that was "Ding Dong Dic Tac". You diss me, you're crazy. Wanna kill me? Hit me on the nut. Never on my own, always with someone... You've got to put out the rubbish tomorrow. Come on. Here, David. Take this to Mum's, please. - Are you going barefoot? - I'm not barefoot. Hang on, hang on. Sorry, David, I forgot the ladle, it's mine. Oro, are you barefoot? Mum? - Got any cigarettes left? - Yeah, but not many... - How's it going? - Good. - How about you? - I'm good. Luna was finishing some work. She was all excited, Walking Dead's new series starts today. She was all over the place. - What about you? - Fine. Will you give me directions? - How was your day? - So we don't get lost. I'm a bit tired. I left in the morning. - It's bloody cold, isn't it? - Yeah, I'm gonna turn this up. There are always loads of cars here. My sister was so happy, she's been given the... She got a call from the university. She was over the moon. She got the job. She was super excited. Plus she doesn't have fixed schedules or anything like that. - Even if it's from home. - I still don't know. As far as I understood, according to the agreement, she had to work 17 hours last time. But I don't know if that's marking from home or doing tutorials. I made Luna's bed the wrong way around. Never mind. She puts it the other way around, right? - Well, never mind. - It varies. - Just got a call from the university. - What did they say? - Asking me about the diploma. - You're joking! - The one where you're working...? - Yeah. - And what did you say? - They're processing it. - This won't last much longer. - What? They're inspecting everything with a fine-tooth comb... I'm gonna try and get it done this evening, otherwise... A, A, A, A and B. - Bloody Religion! Shit! - Why? - What did they say to you? - This is yours. - Are these mine? - Yeah, I've got two. Just the usual. No, "the usual" won't do. That's not on. That's not on. I don't know what "the usual" is, but I do know your achievement has got worse this term. And getting worse results isn't acceptable, Oro. Let's see... You've been asking why video games are not allowed and the explanation is right here. - "His achievement has got worse..." - Do you have to read it aloud? - Don't you want me to? - No. What has become quite clear is that... You must become more independent. Know what it means? To figure things out on your own. Not having someone all the time who tells you what to do. That's what it means. And it's true, you need that. Go about your business and deal with stuff on your own. The teacher is actually right. Everything she's said is true. And why can't we play Xbox? Here's why, because you... Remember I told you that with zero effort and focus... you managed to pass... but just scraping by? It's official. Less effort and his handwriting is worse. I already knew all that. What you do defines you. Batman said that, not me. What we do is what we are, Oro. Not what we think we are, but what we do. Anything you do has consequences. Yeah, put on your knickers. But if you don't think that now or later, it'll happen again. David, I'm telling you again... that I've already done my homework. And now I've wasted my bloody time. Yeah, that does count. - I could have gone out. - And the girls couldn't? - They could have too. - What do they think? You think about going out now, later, tomorrow morning. - Yes, but tomorrow... - But you never think about homework. You've never ever thought: "Now it's time for homework." But every time you're told... Oro, you either get your act together and you make your own plans, or an atomic bomb will explode at home, I promise. And I wouldn't like that at all, I don't want that to happen. When I tell you something, it's not because of me. When I tell you, "Tear that page out," I'm not thinking of myself, it doesn't make me happy. Seriously. I'm not thinking this is gonna do me good. If you tear out that page, my record sales will skyrocket, my music will be so cool, posters of my band will be plastered all over the place because Oro has torn out a page. And we don't make any progress, because you don't want to, and it's doing my head in. Imagine how I feel speaking to a mate if he covers his ears. I feel awful. I feel terrible. Is he actually my mate? Or is he taking the piss? Or what? Arriving at your village, you might think I'm blind. You wanna see me? I decide. Ideas fly for messengers. No fighting is my style of fighting. Mercenaries, they take sides. Are you with them, or are you digging me? My sword is made of bamboo. No reason to commit seppuku. Old School, Ice Cool, New School. My haiku can knock you to the ground. I follow my own Bushido rules... Growing up like Chihiro, that's my principle. I draw my mike, Toshiro Mifune. Clint Eastwood, JazzTray Club, David Tifone. I'm a member of an independent clan. My name's Jesse Caster, I'm here to see you. Watch it, you can't hide no more. My word craft versus your death pad. I climb the slope, I preach in the Sahara. A survivor, just like Shuya Nanahara. Pure and clear, just like water, and deeper than a Kurosawa dream. Okay. Ni?ato! Money, power, that's what they sell. Being their toy doesn't convince us. Luxury life... From the top. Money, power... Money, power, that's what they sell. Being their toy doesn't convince us. Luxury life or an ordinary life. We've no doubt at all though it's in front of me. I turn to my people. Even though it's in front of me, I turn to my people. I just wanna fly. I just wanna fly. I just wanna fly. I just wanna fly. It's funny, there are quite a few of us teachers who step outside in between lessons. "Just going to call the kids, see how they're doing." Always the same topic. "How was your Spanish exam?" "Fine." "Eat your sandwich." - You should pop in one day, it's nice. - Yeah, sure. You could pick me up, that would be cool. - The other day Oro said... - Not this weekend, the next. "Do you teach at a university?" "Yes, Oro." "Oh, I didn't know." Really? Honestly? The little shit! Seriously, man, what a little brat! "Really?" God... Is it for three years or just one? The grant is for one. At least one in my case. Then you can apply for... - An extension. - Yeah, up to three. So you can extend it for a second year. And then a third one? Theoretically only three, but they told me that one girl... who's been applying for years... - She was always awarded one. - If they like your project. They undertake to fund your whole project. Cool! And no holidays? - A whole year non-stop? - Holidays later on. - When? - Study for a year, then holidays. Like in... April more or less. - Starting when? - From August to April. Jesus. You get a rest during that month. That's when you reapply for the grant. For the following year if you want to stay on. That's cool, because if you get it once, you always get it. So, if you get the grant, that's it. You're away. Pretty much. One year isn't much. If I stay, you can come with me. Or during the first one, if I can. But in the short term, that's not very likely. Not bloody likely. Awesome. Sounds cool. - Awesome if you get the grant. - Just getting it is amazing. - It's cool, yeah. - Bloody amazing. I'm gonna miss you tonnes. - We'll see each other. - On Skype. How are you doing? - Fine. - Cool. That's the way. You're all hard at it today. I've seen you, heard you. - I've corrected it. - Great. - Let me do it. - I'm not saying anything. - Let me do it. - You're doing fine, champ. Emos and hipsters. - You look like a hipster. - Emo is with "h", like "hipsters." Your name's David and you live in Madrid. You're like a partridge, and never end your speech. My nose itches, but I buy you a liquorice. And even if you wound me, you don't leave a scar. Give me a liquorice Go for it, Karate Kid. It's a kick in the nose. - That's the crux. - Of the matter. I'm the myth. Of your song! Come on, let's focus. Sorry, I distracted you. Kids. - What? - I've got to get changed. Okay. Move over. Come on, Oro. Oro. Come on, wake up. Move it. Oro, that doesn't count. Come on. Dude. Come on, it's Friday. Where are your clothes? Hand me the jacket. Didn't you wear it yesterday? What's that? - Your clothes? - Yeah. Take it. Come on. Bless you. - Shall I blow on your eye? - No. Oro. Up you get. That was my foot.
