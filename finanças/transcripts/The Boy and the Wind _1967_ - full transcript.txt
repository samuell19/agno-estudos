We'd like to thank the invaluable collaboration of the authorities the population of Visconde do Rio Branco the Ministry of Aviation and the Park Department of Lagoa Santa. COURT OF JUSTICE Attention! A message from the district judge for the entire population: The 15h15 train arrived at this moment. Bringing to the city, the engineer Jos? Roberto Nery. Whose judgment, which is public knowledge... ...not yet come to an end. The engineer will be questioned tomorrow, wednesday... ...at the end of the process. To avoid any commotion, the district judge... ...asks to everyone to stay calm... ...to respect the defendant... ...and to wait the serene court decision. - He's cute. - Stop it! Engineer Jos? Roberto Nery? You might remember me. I'm the commissary of Bela Vista. I'm here to protect you. Why all this? I don't get it. Whatever is the reason, the population is angry. Get him! Poor guy. Kill the big foreigner bird There's no thief next to Saint John Kill the big foreigner bird Kill the big foreigner bird Go away! I don't want to see anyone around here! You're safe in there. You better stay inside. I'll come to get you tomorrow morning. It's hotter than hell here. - There's no wind? - Not anymore. What do you mean? They say it's because of the dam. - Since when? - I don't know, a long time. Alright, thanks. Come in! Sorry. There's no problem. I'm accustomed... - Do you still remember me? - Sure. My memory isn't that bad. - I stayed here more than a month. - 28 days. You look tired. The reception... ...I didn't expect that. You better drink that before it gets cold. Is it good? It's delicious as always. Do you still make it everyday? Never again. The boy told me there's no wind anymore. - Yes, it stopped. - Not even a little bit? A little breeze sometimes. But thanks God those strong winds stopped. It's a shame all these events. The windy city... The boy told it's because of the dam. A dam doesn't change the wind. They pull some hills down. I think it's because of that. Maybe... - Do you want more? - No, thanks. None of that needed to happen. - If you... - Sorry, I'm tired. Do I tell the lawyer to come back tomorrow? I didn't get it. There's a lawyer downstair that wants to talk with you. Please, send him up. If you need me... The process is full of infamy and inconsistencies. The accusation relies on empty and illegal elements. Why you left this happen? I didn't care. This law stuff... The news were vague and the communication was strange. They told me it didn't matter. This city is too distant. I never thought... Distant? Yes, it is. There's no city more distant than this one. It's far from God and morality. Just so you know, no one here is a good person. Even I. Your crime is barbaric. I did nothing, I am innocent. That's what you will say at this point? I'll tell the truth anytime. Listen! We don't hear anything else beside that in the city. Everybody liked Bent Jack. I liked him a lot. I'll tell you something. If you cooperate, everything will be fine. Listen... That body they found, wasn't a body of a boy. It was found in a river out of town. As for the rest, don't be afraid. We need to eliminate the witnesses. Who are they? The most important one, you know her very well. She brought you some coffee. People say the registrar loves her. They say she doesn't care about him. But he saved her hotel from bankruptcy. He has a big influence here. To a certain extent. Like I told you: no one here is a good person. Look at me... My wife ran off with another man. My son left when he was 15. I'll be honest. They indicated me to defend you. But I'm doing this only for the money. Dirty money. I know you can't stand me anymore. But you need me. And with the money, I can save you. I'm not lying. I work only out of self-interest. I'm not an expensive lawyer. You really prefer to deny the crime... ...or just to present something extenuatory? I already told you there's no crime. Alright, I understand it. But it was before. That's the last thing I need, you confessing to everyone. But now I'm here. We're close to each other. I told you about my personality. Now about my professionalism.... ....I'm flawless after payment. I keep professional secrecy until I die. There... ...in the courtroom, three rustic stupid people. And four more ignorant men. It's natural to deny the crime. Down on your knees, the way you like it. You'll say that you didn't even know the boy. But I did know the boy! I liked him. We stayed together for three weeks. We got along very well. This way it will be hard to convince anyone of your innocence. How could you get along with that miserable boy? You... ...a rich engineer. Who work just for fun. I know. The only reason for you to get along with him was... Was that? A sexual one. Is this in the process? If I'm not mistaken, it's in the testimony of your little friend. The hotel owner. Wasn't she your little friend? It seems like she said... Where are you going? - To talk with her! - Don't do that! This isn't good. The registrar is with her, as always. He comes every night. He's a dangerous man. He's a imposter, servile and authoritarian. According to the convenience. Like everyone in this city. We'll clarify everything in court. Is the proper place for great discussions. Other than that, I know about everything. Ask me. For example... That woman has a secret passion. For God's sake, I can't stand these rumors anymore. I don't live here. I don't care. I'm just giving you relevant information. Don't you think it's important to know... ...that the main prosecution witness... ...is in love with the defendant? - With me? - You see... You're young and inexperienced. You need someone to defend you. - You sign the warrant... - Never mind! - I will defend myself. - Yourself? And with this attitude? Don't play with the law, friend. You're too young to commit suicide. Nobody knows how is the jail of this city. There's no light and the walls are rotten. Only the rats and the germs survive there. It's for you. If I were you, I wouldn't leave the hotel. I've heard that before. I am very distressed to feel fear. I want to see the city. Take it with you. I'M WAITING FOR YOU ON THE HILL ? MARIO This is weird. The wind was so strong that nearly tore my clothes off. - Now there's nothing. - It's completely changed. They give various explanations. For me, it's because of the communists. After they dropped that 100 megatons bomb... ...the world's climate has changed. No one can convince me otherwise. - Can I walk with you? - No, thank you. There's no thief next to Saint John Kill the big foreigner bird Kill the big foreigner bird Kill the big foreigner bird I knew you would come. Zeca parents preferred to bury him here, outside the cemetery. This hill belongs to one of the uncles. It's ours. There is. The mother made ??the grave. She's sure that the boy is dead. Who knows. They never found the body. You didn't meet me when you were here. I don't have a close relationship with my cousins??.. I'm the rich cousin. You see... I always watched you. I saw your game. - What game? - Don't worry. I'm at your side. I know you are innocent. At least of the murder. The other things aren't crime. They just don't understand it. They're normal people. They're the society. The minorities have to protect themselves. - If not, they will destroy us. - What do you mean? You know what I mean. Do you know who threw rocks on the train? Zeca's mother and I. Why me? I don't want anyone to suspect us. I brought you here because of that. I really like you. The minorities have to protect themselves. Jews, communists... Us.... The normal people will never absolve you. Ego te absolvo. It's latin. Do you know what went wrong? You listened to her. You should have understood it. Only us can understand passion. Only us. Everything she wanted was that night you spent with her. 43 years old, she didn't expect anything. Then you showed up. And you left without saying anything. See, I know everything. Everybody in this town thinks they know everything. - The registrar, I don't know how... - She... It isn't the registrar. The registrar is a tool. Everybody knows this. He's a copy of her image. You left. Why would you come back? The boy was gone. They brought you back with this sordid accusation. Your destruction is all that matters to her. Because you'll stay here forever. In jail or dead. Do you want to get free? Give it up, again. I'll be there as a witness. I could tell them about my cabin... But I want to help you. But it depends on you, of course. You brought me here for this? Do you think I would accept help from a blackmailer? You're wrong. You're wrong too. I wanted to help you. - Are you hurt? - It's nothing. You don't need to worry. - Are you feeling better? - Yes, thank you. I think you should rest now. Your day couldn't have been worse. Are you afraid? Yes. But I try not to think about it. This room is cozy. I don't rent it anymore. Sometimes I sleep here. When I'm uneasy. How old is she? 20. 20 years old... You think I'm too old. 20 years is almost the difference... ...between us. I thought you had gone. - He's ok? - I don't care. He's afraid, apparently. Do you think he has a chance? The evidences are important. Also what they'll say, but... ...what really matters is what I write. You know... A sentence, a word... Public opinion is on our side. Since we control the journal and the radio... ...this can't go wrong. Monster. The poor boy was so nice and happy... Jorge, we can't let him go free. He must be buried here too. Well, as all of us who didn't commit any crime. Everything you want, Laura. I'll do all I can... Good night, Jorge. It's late. PEOPLE NEWSPAPER THE MONSTER WILL BE JUDGE TODAY - Good morning. - Good morning. I brought you some coffee. And I want to apologize. About what? About the piano. I know it bothers you, but I can't avoid. I played it until late at night. Will you be disappointed if I say I didn't hear it? - I was very tired. - Good. I played it softly. And I closed the door. I need to play it before going to sleep. The registrar said I lost some clients because of it. I don't think I play that bad. Nice color and fabric. When I'm cleaning the room, I soon know all about the client. Because of the clothes and objects. Even because of the smell. The journalist is here. Do you want to see him? Alright. Only one person can help you, Roberto. You can call me if you need. I only told them what I know. - What are your expectations? - I won't say anything. - But the people expect... - Please, he won't say anything. Kill him! Killer! ASSESSMENT So, did you change your mind? If you go to jury you're finished. It began the first hearing for the trial of the defendant... ...engineer Jos? Roberto Nery.... ...in the process of public action... ...of the city Bela Vista, Santa F? district. The defendant's attorney will give a special clarification. Judge... ...as a lawyer indicated by the district... ...to represent the defendant... ...I'm ask for permission for the defendant... ...an engineer... ...a qualified person... ...to make your own oral defense. Does it expresses the real desire of the defendant... ...without directly or indirectly coercion? Yes, Sir. "Yes, Your Honor". Sorry. Yes, Your Honor Then read the complaint for the defendant... ...be aware of the laws and the penalties which he's included. The Santa Fe district accuses the engineer Jos? Roberto... Your name? Maria Paiva. Are you Jos? Paiva's mother, known as Bent Jack? - Yes, Sir. - Why "Bent Jack"? Because we live in the bent up in the hill. Everybody loved the boy. - He was a saint, never... - I know. Do you live alone? With my eldest son. My husband died or fled four years ago. Did you know the boy was working everyday with the defendant? He was never at home. He stopped to work at the station. He was always with the engineer. But did he stop making money? No, Sir. More or less than before? Much more. Did he tell you what kind of work he was doing for the engineer? No. He just told me that he guided him with by horse and on foot. Did he tell you about the engineer friends in the city? No, Sir. Not at all. The engineer always spent the whole day with him. Does this shirt belongs to your son? Yes, Sir. Was he using it when he disappeared? - Yes, Sir... - Thank you. That's all. Does the defendant lawyer wishes to interrogate the witness? The defendant wants to say... ...that he doesn't intend, by his lawyer... ...present here only for a technical guidance... ...to interrogate this witness or any other. No matter what they'll say. The defendant is aware that this rupture... ...of the rules of the traditional trial... ...is something that will be bad for you at the end of the trial. I know, Your Honor Prosecutor. I want to interrogate the witness... ...Aparecido Teles. Are you Aparecido Teles? Yes, Sir. Answer using just "yes" or "no". Did you know the defendant and Bent Jack were friends? Yes. What do you do for a living? I'm handyman at a farm up in the hill. - Was over there that you saw them? - Yes, Sir. Did you notice any strange behavior? Yes, Sir. Can you explain that? Well... Did you notice something strange about their relationship? Yes, Sir. We knew they were always together. I only told this to his mother when the dust settled. You can tell us. This is important. Let's go before the wind take you away! Go on! The boy was naked. Silence! You can go on. So the boy was naked. What happened after that? Speak! What happened? They hugged each other. Silence! Or you all will have to left the room! So they hugged each other. And then? I don't know. A thunder startled my mare and I had to run after her. Thank you. That's all. The defendant, by yourself or by your lawyer... ...insists on not interrogating the witnesses? My client want it that way, Your Honor So let's continue. Mario Jairo Paiva. Do you swear to tell the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? I swear. Are you a witness voluntarily or not? I ask if you're here by your own will. Yes, Sir. What did you see or know that made you came here today? See, since the engineer arrived... ...until the day he suddenly left... ...he was always with Bent Jack. And that seemed suspicious to you? Yes. Especially... ...I always saw the two together. In the windstorm and wild places. What do you mean by... ..."he suddenly left"? He didn't warn anyone. Not even the hotel. He checked out and didn't say anything. This seemed especially suspect? Yes. Two days before that, he wanted to rent my cabin... ...up in the hill. For two months. Did he say that? He sent Bent Jack to me, with $200. I told I was going to think about it. I found it strange someone want to rent a place so uncomfortable. In the middle of the strong winds. But Bent Jack told that he was wanting exactly that: To be alone. To days later my cousin vanished. Did you talk with the defendant? No, Sir. Not even once. Thank you, that's all. Isaura Salesa. Even her? Do you know that you have to tell just the truth? Only what you really heard or saw? Yes, Sir. Do you know the engineer Roberto Nery? Yes, very well. Can you point him out? It's him. Who introduced him to you? - Zeca? - Yes, Sir. What was your relationship with Zeca? - He was my friend. - A boyfriend? - I thought so... - Did you saw... ...something shocking? - From the engineer? - No, Sir. I thought he was a good guy. Never? Are you sure? Do you know what I mean? Yes, Sir. In fact... On day he got nervous because he saw me with Zeca. I never saw him that way. He didn't seem the same. The lawyer doesn't want to say anything? Unfortunately, Your Honor.. ...my client doesn't want to interrupt it. I won't remind the defendant of his rights. However, I want to clarify the exemption of this courtroom... ...reiterating that anytime... ...he can interrupt the trial to say anything necessary. Thank you, Your Honor You were saying that you never saw the engineer so nervous. What did he say exactly? He said that Zeca was almost a man and he should respect me. He shouldn't do something like that with a decent girl like me. After Zeca left, the engineer hugged me and walked me to my house. He told me to not get involved with boys like Zeca. So did you obey him? Yes, Sir. Well, I almost never saw Zeca again. He was always working. Only at the last time I saw him... ...I was so sad... ...he told me he wouldn't go out with the engineer to go out with me. And he did? I never saw him again. Silence! Ok, thank you. You can leave. Miss Laura Sampaio. Are you aware... ...that you have to tell just the truth? Yes, Sir. When you met the engineer? When he arrived here. He stayed at my hotel. - He was alone or with someone? - Alone. Well, he was with the bellhop. But that's normal. Did he tell you why... ...he was alone in this city? Any parents, any friends? - Was he here to work? - Nothing. He told me almost nothing. Apparently he was only on vacation. It was you who gave this garment to the authorities? Yes. Where you found it? In his room. - When? - The day he left. How often you went there? All the time. How often you go in the clients rooms? It isn't usual. Was there some special interest for you to went there? Are you divorced? Everybody knows that my husband left me. So do you think you're an independent woman? Yes. - How old are you? - 39. Did you feel attracted by the defendant? Extremely attracted? Am I obliged to answer that? You should. I had a certain attraction. Did he feel the same? To some extent, yes. Sorry, but this is important for the trial. Everybody knows you're an attractive woman. The defendant is a young man. Nothing would stop both of you to go further in your relationship... How far have you gone with him? You don't need to answer if you don't want to. You didn't need to do this. - I could attach the button. - It's ok. I'm used to do it. I do everything when I'm traveling. It won't take too long. Done! Thank you. Put it there, thank you. Did you use the telephone? Yes. - Do you want anything else? - No, thank you. Don't get me wrong. I never did something like that. I'm not thinking about it, but... ...there's something very important to me. I didn't ask you anything. I'm telling you. This may seem strange today, but... I have some terrible problems in my mind. How can I explain it without offending you... Jos? Roberto Nery. Is your name Jos? Roberto Nery? Yes, Sir. Are you an engineer? Yes, Sir. How old are you? 25. For how long did you stay here? 28 days. Did you have any particular reason? This isn't a popular tourist destination. It may seem strange... ...but I came because of the wind. I'm fascinated by the wind since I was a child. You're a strange man. Were you the last person who saw the boy? How can I know that? Did you sign this hotel bill? Yes. You left the city... ...at 7am, May 23. The last time the boy was seen with you... ...was on the night of May 22. - Right? - Yes. My interrogation is completed, Your Honor The defendant has anything to say directly... ...or by your lawyer? Your Honor.. ...maybe I can explain what happened. Maybe I can't. But I'll tell everything that really happened. Since the day I arrived. I exempted the lawyer, who I met only yesterday... ...not by contempt for this experienced professional. Or by lack of respect for the courtroom. But I know what happened to me... ...can't be explained trough documents. Maybe what I will tell now, Sir... Your Honor Maybe what I will tell now, Your Honor.. ...won't be included in the trial... ...I was oriented by my lawyer. People think I'm a freak. And because of that they want to convict me. And all these people that surround me on a daily basis... Even here... If everybody here thinks they're normal... ...maybe I'm a freak. I don't say that as an offense. It's an observation. Because I'm not like everybody else. We can take a break if you want to rest. No, I'm fine. It's just... So go on. Your Honor.. ...the boy was with me when he disappeared. But I didn't anything bad with him. I didn't throw away his confidence in me or what we believed. This isn't true. I don't know if I'm defending or incriminating myself, but... ...the fact is that the boy is missing or dead. Maybe I'm unintentionally an accomplice of this crime. I'm an engineer specialized in bridges. I already have enough experience, despite my age... ...it's been ten years since I work with a distant relative... ...an engineer specialized in bridges. So at age 25... ...I'm in a position that no other engineer could be before 40. I didn't study engineering because of the vocation... ...but because of a philosophical determination. I belong to a family where most men... ...aren't practical men. Since I was a child I was surrounded by... ...a painter, a writer, an actor, a journalist... What was something fascinating for me in my childhood ... ...turned into something terrible in my youth. At 15 years I had seen all the suffering... ...of those people I loved. And I attributed this suffering to those... ...poorly paid professions in this unstable country. So I swore that I would be a practical man. I swore I would dedicate myself to something concrete. Mathematical. Even if it was completely opposite to my vocation. To my instinct. I tried to live with positive things. With explainable feelings. This profession took me away from my family. And I managed to refuse everything that couldn't be explained by logic. I destroyed my tendency to dream. I thought I was finally free from the darkness. Until the day I saw his body in the wind. An old fascination with the wind brought me to this city. I was exhausted after months of unstoppable work. I needed to rest. The image of three dead employees... ...in an unfortunate accident... ...was imprinted on my mind. Is the wind always strong here? It could take the city away if not for the city hall attention. But it always knock people down. - But is it always strong? - Do you think it's strong here? People say it's stronger up in the hill. But I never left the city. For 30 years. It stopped. It's a crazy wind. It comes and go. Just like a spoiled child. Hey boy! You have work to do! I take it! - To where? - Bela Vista Hotel. - By car or horse? - How far is it? - It's two blocks away. - We can walk. - Ok? - Sure. - Were you born here? - Yes, Sir. - Are you descended from indians? - My grandmother is indian. Where's this famous wind? I thought it was windy every day. People told me it's the Wind City. But it is! It really is! The wind was very strong yesterday. Look! It took the roof tiles away. I laughed my head off! They flew away like leaves. - Do you like the wind? I don't like this soft wind. I really like the wind up there. And there! And there! I can take you up there if you want to. - Do you wake up early? - Yes, I do. - So, 8am? - Do you think 8am is early? - 5am! - But I'm sleeping at 5am! - So, 5am. - Alright. Excuse me, can you use another table? This is the registrar's table. He always sit here. I'm sorry. - A welcome gift. - Thank you. That night I slept thinking about the following day. It was a deep sleep. Interrupted only by the noise of the wind. But I didn't know if it was a dream or the reality. The horse and the wind... Your Honor, I don't know If I'm talking nonsense. If I can tell about everything. If you want to listen it. Of course, go on. So, where's the wind? Do you want me to call it? Look! Did you hear it last night? I slept like a log. Too bad. But it wasn't a strong wind. Today the wind will be really strong. How do you know that? I can feel it. But there's no wind. What do you feel? Something... Something... - What's your name? - Bent Jack. What a name... Because I always lived in that bent. My real name is Jos? de Paiva. - And you? - Jos?, like you. People call you Bent Jack or Straight Jack? I don't have any nicknames. People call me Jos? Roberto. I told you! Look! Come with me! Hold the bridle tight! Hold the saddle with the other hand. You'll need to speed up when we arrive up there. Now! Now! The people are afraid of the wind. I make fun of them. - Where the wind comes? - I don't know. My grandma say it's God who blows the wind. When the wind is strong... ...I always think that many things are happening and nobody knows. - Where. - In the world... The wind is very important, isn't? Well, don't you know it helped the discovery of Brazil? The wind? Wow... When will you leave? I don't know. Someday. I don't want you to leave before I show you the big wind. The one that took the roof piles away. - When it'll happen? - It depends... It stopped. The world is boring without it. Everything looks like a picture. Your Honor, I'm trying to tell you exactly what he told me, but... ...it's impossible. I can't replicate the beautiful way he talked. A curious friendship grew between us. We shared the same passion: the wind. I tried hard to resist. But now I know I can't live without the wind. The way some people can't live without the sun or the sea. And he was the wind itself. It was part of his humor, joys and melancholies. Everybody in the city thought he was a slacker. He didn't have many friends. I had none. He gave me his poetic intuition and I gave him my adult knowledge. And my vague knowledge of meteorology. Look! All frizz clouds are in the same direction. It means that the wind is up there, got it? It means that the wind is up there, got it? - It's going to the sea. - How do you know? - The Atlantic coast is that way. - Coast what? The coast of the Atlantic Ocean. You never heard about it? Now I remember it... My teacher told that. - Have you ever seen the sea? - Not yet. But my mother wouldn't like it. - Is the wind strong there? - It depends. Sometimes the wind speed is 90km/h! - How do you know? - We measure it with devices. That's nonsense. We measure it looking at the trees and at the clothes. Sometimes I thought he was doing that for money... ...or anything else from me. But then I discovered that he was truly... ...a friend of the wind. - Didn't you see the wind last night? - No, I didn't. You sleep too much. I can't sleep if it's windy. Last night the wind was blowing everywhere. I watched it through the keyhole. And a small breeze blew in my eye. Hey! He's my cousin. He lives in Rio. He's rich. Hey Ear of Corn! - Who's there? - Ear of Corn and her father. - Who is she? - She's my girlfriend. But it's a secret. My mother doesn't know. And her father would kill me! And her father would kill me! ...air masses all night long. I told my grandma about it. She said you're wrong. And I agree with her. The wind is blowed by giants. From behind that mountain range. If it's too strong, it's called "squall". When it gets dark, it's a "tornanado". - It's the worst. - I think you're wrong. If the wind is colorless, how come the tornado is dark? Well, It covers the sun. It?s no use insisting. She's always that way. Sometimes she spend days without saying one word. Here it comes! Look! It's in that tree! It's gone. I bet it will return. Hey Ear of Corn! Look, it's back! Suddenly, for two days... ...after two weeks of strong winds... ...the wind stopped. It was a mystery that bothered me. It made me forget my resistance to abstract things. Because the trees stood still for two days. The windows were open. They were static. People hardly had air to breathe. I had trouble sleeping. And for 48 hours... ...Zeca didn't come. ...Zeca didn't come. ...my mind began to mistake Zeca with the wind. I didn't know if there was wind because Zeca was there... ...or if Zeca appeared when was windy. Sorry Sir, but did you see my son? No, ma'am. I haven't seen him for two days. He didn't come today, as we agreed. God, he didn't come home. I wonder if something happened. Mr. Roberto, you have a phone call from Rio. Is your fiancee. Don't worry, he'll show up. Hello? Yes, please. Hello? Yes, my love. I'm fine. Yes, I have. Soon. I'm feeling better. I read, I take walks... I think I'll leave the day after tomorrow. Yes, monday. Of course I love you. Sure, sure... Yes, you can wait for me. No, I'm not in a hurry... Ok, my love. Put it there, thank you. - Did you use the telephone? - Yes. Hey! - Where have you been? - I was at the church. My mother forced me to make a confession. I'm talking about the last two days! Your mother was worried! Yes, poor mother. But I couldn't stand it. I had to leave. When I was walking by the crossing, the train conductor shouted: "the train is leaving!" Do you know what I did? I took the train to the sea. Two days with the wind blowing in my face. The train is a wind too. Do you know what is the most beautiful thing? The sea wind. My mother beat me up. But it was worth it. Where are you going? To the train station. To buy my return ticket. When are you leaving? Tomorrow. Too bad... I didn't show you the big wind. Are you sure? I have to. I have work to do. Well, someday I'll leave too. Now I want the wind sea. Sorry, I was going to clean the room. I left to buy my return ticket. - Tomorrow? - I have to work. Your fiancee? Did you rest well? Yes. The boy will miss you. You can't call someone like this. Today is the day! - What? - The big wind! For your farewell party. - How do you know that? - I ordered it! Look, the air is like this... Look! Oh, not that. Are you a magician? Now? No, this afternoon. Look at the trees. I was lost and alone in the middle of the strong wind. I was afraid without my guide. The strong wind was pushing me away. It was the strongest wind. It was coming from the forest or the sea. From the center of the earth. Bringing with it all the affluents. The wind of the countryside. The breezes of the lagoons. Hot winds from hell. A combination of several winds. Emanations from other lands. Pieces of distant landscapes. An eternal, violent and fascinating world. But the spectacle was incomplete. Without the wizard who unleashed that formidable force. Zeca! - Why did you take so long? - My mother! I couldn't miss this! I told you! I told you! I'm leaving with this one! I returned to Rio the next day without thinking about it. I was sure the boy would return. I already imagined him in the city. Integrated into his wind. Then I learned by a anonymous letter that I was being accused. Your Honor.. ...I feel embarrassed to have to tell all this here. Things that seem implausible A crime is a crime. But a story with the wind like this one... ...may seem something invented and absurd But that's the simple and intense truth. I don't know if it would incriminate or absolve me. But I told you everything exactly as it happened. Or what my memory kept. I tried to tell everything. I'm not ashamed of some naive and childish details. We shared together, the boy and I... ...a rare revelation. I want to be judged only as a human being. As a humble person in the presence of the mysteries that surround me.... and crush me. I want to tell about a striking fact, at least for me. But I don't know if this will have the same impact on you. Everybody know that after that windstorm... ...the city became calm. Everybody noticed this, but nobody wanted to think about it. And lastly I want to say... ...I'm not a killer. Mainly because I don't think he's dead. We can't kill a force of nature. We can't kill a thunder or the light. He can return to this city anytime. Pure as he left. You Honor, who can say Bent Jack is dead? Why we can't admit that he arrived with this wind... ...and that he's now going up the stairs. THE END
