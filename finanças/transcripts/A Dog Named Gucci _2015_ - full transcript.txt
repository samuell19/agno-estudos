- I think if anybody who sees animals being abused, get involved. Phone call, telephone call to the police, anybody. Do something but don't let animals be abused. - [Voiceover] Live, this is Action News 10. - Many of you may remember Gucci the dog and the senseless act of violence that left the puppy scarred for life. - If you've been following this story of Gucci. - You'll probably recall the story, Little Gucci. - Good news tonight for Gucci. - The Golf Coast love affair with Gucci the dog continues tonight. (slow music) - [Voiceover] There was a chow-husky mix and you can tell in some of his pictures he looks like a chow and some look like a husky in the others. He was a great dog. Fun little dog. - [Voiceover] This is Halled street. And what is known as the Historic District, Old Dauphin Way District of Mobile. And this was the house where I lived. It's considered a historic house, built in about 1903. I was selling it, this was in '94. I talked to the young man who was gonna come look at it. And he didn't show up the night he was supposed to show up. So I thought, well I'll try again. So I called him again and he said okay I'll be there tonight. So I was out here in front, it was about 9:30 at night. My neighbor here I was coming home from the grocery store, and so we chatted. And while we were chatting, I'd heard this little puppy yelp and so about the time she and I were talking, I saw this fireball drop from a tree, and run towards the houses. And I thought that's a dog. So I went running down there and I heard, it sounded like four people running away from me. And by that time the dog was gone and I was banging on the doors of the houses down there because I knew they probably knew what happened. And so one of the fellas came out and his name is Paul, and I told him what had happened. I said somebody had burned a dog right here and he just disappeared under the house somewhere. He came on down and then we saw the dog, it came under to the front of the house. Underneath, it's behind one of those lattice works, so Paul grabbed a hose that was there and he turned it on and started spraying the dog to put out the fire. The little dog was literally blazing from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail. The eeriest thing, he came underneath that whole porch and he was standing there looking at me on fire. And I couldn't get to him. - I was 15. Yeah I was a 15 year old runaway. I was living with people that obviously probably weren't very good people to be around. And the more I hung out and the more I mean drugs we did and whatever, the deeper I kinda got embedded into the wrong crowd. And it got to a point where they, you know didn't see me as just baby girl anymore. It was you know, they wanted more. There was a situation where I was asked to go out with one of the guys and I refused, I said no. And the threats started coming in, okay well you stay around, you'll see what happens. Me and Tony, the girl that I was living with, we went to dinner that night and we came back and got out of the cab and that's when the whole thing with Gucci happened. - And what they had done, they had taken him and strung him up by his neck in a tree. And they were slapping him, that's what I heard when I heard the yelping. And then they got tired of that and one of the guys went to his car and got some lighter fluid and sprayed it at his head and his neck and they set him on fire. (slow music) - Whey they pulled him out from underneath the house, and I remember them handing Gucci to me, it was like his whole face. Not so much the rest of his body but just his whole face was burned. I mean the tips of his ears were singed down, he had no hair left on his face at all. I just remember the black, the blackness of burned. You know something is burned and you pick it up and you get that, just that black all over your hands of charcoal. That's what was coming off of his face, and coming off of him when I was holding him. - So I went on back up to my house to wait for the man to look at it. And so the fella showed up and while we were, I was showing the house and the girl came into the house, all full of soot. This dog had been burned so badly and she was crying of course and wanted to know if I'd take him to the vet. - I needed someone safe at that moment and being a runaway, I mean it wasn't like I could call home or call mom and dad or you know, hey I'm in trouble I need your help. - And I don't know why she came to me. I guess, I was a neighbor and these people knew me and knew I was a good guy. I drove them around town, took the kids to school and all that kind of stuff. - And Doug you know made a commitment to me, he said that night, when I handed him my dog and said I can't take care of this dog, you have to help him, you have to do something, to help him. - So I took him home and on the way I stopped at a drug store to see if the doctor, the pharmacists could recommend something for the burn. So he gave me suggestions so I got a spray. He said put it on the paper, on the cloth and then blot him so you don't scare him with the spraying. So I stopped at the fire station down here on the way home to see if they had any suggestions. Of course they were outraged what they had done to the dog. So I brought him on home and I had other dogs here so I put in a dog bed in my back bedroom where I slept. He was so quiet. I thought well, I really was thinking all night he's not going to live, he's not going to live. How can people be that cruel. How can they be that mean. - I woke up one night, it was late. I was asleep and I got a phone call, the first one I had ever received from Doug. Doug was pretty frantic and was just looking to get both a connection and some advice on how to proceed from there. And he was wondering if I knew of a good person to call. - And he brought this puppy in to my clinic, that following morning. This puppy was pretty small and I could smell the lighter fluid on him still. And he was burned in the face and most of his hair had been burned off. Nothing can prepare you for something like that. You think you've seen it all, you haven't. - [Voiceover] A local attorney who wishes to remain anonymous has agreed to pay for Gucci's surgery. Even though he hasn't seen the dog in person. Says all he wants is to see the puppy fully recovered. - It was obvious that the dog (clears throat) if he survived was going to have significant vet bills. And I don't remember if it was Doug James or if there were just a general plea for help for the poor dog and I did what I think what most any normal, loving human being should do. And I called him, I said, I mean I was moved by the, just how sadistic that act was. And I said I'll pay his bills, whatever they are. Send me the bills. - There's been a tremendous out pouring, The People Mobile, I got calls from Florida and from Mississippi. People who were concerned about this sort of cruelty to animals. Actually he's been a wonderful dog, he has been super. He's never complained. The first two weeks of course, he was in such bad shape he slept but he never complained. He ate well and the last two weeks he's been a puppy. He's begun to play, I have another dog he plays with. And he runs in the house just like a normal puppy. So really he's been a delightful dog, he's just been perfect. - It took a while, several months for those burns to be treated and healed. And I remember, maybe about 10 days after my treatment 'cause I saw him everyday. I had Doug bring him in everyday. His skin started to sloth off. And that was scary. - When Dr. Branch debreeded him, the first time she said his ears literally just broke off. She said they were just like crisp bacon. - If he were here you'd see what I was talking about. The skin is truly very contracted. It's certainly the initial surgery, it's gonna make him a whole lot better. If they can give him 75 percent on this initial surgery, I think that would be really, really well. Of course those people at Auburn were really good so they can probably do it. (slow music) - [Voiceover] Preparations for Gucci's surgery started early this morning at Auburn's Veterinary Hospital. By 10 a.m. doctors and students are busy repairing Gucci's burned face and his eyelids. - When I met Gucci I was a resident in ophthalmology at Auburn University. I had never seen a dog that had been, you know maliciously burned and Gucci had second and third degree burns. Third degree burns, they heal by contractor. The scar tissue on top of his head was pulling his eyes up so he looked like a very, kind of a character of a surprised cartoon dog with very wide open eyes and eyelids pulled up. - [Voiceover] Gucci is now at Auburn University School of Veterinary medicine. The puppies eyelids are so damaged, he can't close his eyes. Doctors and Auburn hope to correct the problem with reconstructive surgery. - So if he wouldn't have had the surgery, he would of probably eventually lost vision because the corneas don't do well when they dry out. So both of his eyes were affected, his left eye was more severally affected. And we did a procedure called v to y plasty and basically you're creating a v and then you close it in the shape of a y. So what that does is it basically, tissues that's up like this is gonna be brought down that way so it releases tension. - Gucci is recovering at Auburn University after undergoing three and a half hours of reconstructive surgery to repair his eyelids. They were destroyed when he was set on fire. Gucci's condition is guarded, the next two weeks are critical in the healing process. - When I was taken into custody, I remember them running the story on the news and me sitting around, you know other girl juveniles. And them being like, that was your dog. You know why are they running this story, this is big. And there were so many people involved in taking care of Gucci. Which was something I knew that I couldn't, there's no way I could have done what Dr. James did. - Golf Coast most famous pooch is officially on the road to recovery tonight. Gucci is back home recuperating after undergoing reconstructive surgery on his eyelids. That protective shield you see around his head is to keep him from scratching his eyes. Doctors at the Auburn University School of Veterinary Medicine performed the surgery. You remember Gucci was set on fire awhile back. Allegedly by a group of teens. (Slow music) - And then mean while the legal system was working. There was a police officer here Tommy Menton, unfortunately Tommy's not with us now, but he was the only man with the police force who got involved. - Talking to one of my brothers and I said what was his involvement. And he goes oh he found the guys who did it. And I went oh good for him, nice work. And then it was later I found out that he found the guys who did it kind of on his own. - It happened on a Thursday and I want to say by Sunday or Monday I was being interviewed. They were asking me you know, what happened. Why would they do this to you. Where do you live, where are you from. I just remember them in a car, obviously riding by while the cameras were filming me about the story. And they threatened me and I think that's ultimately how they ended up getting caught. - [Doug] The camera man just turned his camera to the license plate and they were able to track them through that. As a matter of fact I had called a lawyer friend, George Hardesty. - 'Cause he knew I was a lawyer, he knew I was a prosecutor and that I might be able to give him some good advice about what could be done, what should be done. From a legal stand point and social stand point as well with this very tragic incident. - And I asked George if he would represent him, he said yeah I will but won't do any good because in Alabama a dog is a person's possession. - Unfortunately in Alabama at the time there were very few laws protecting animals. (slow music) Owners of the animals and even people who were non owners could pretty much treat the animals anyway they wanted to without running any fear of repercussion. Without any consequences for their actions basically. And it became quite a long road for, to pursue an action against these individuals 'cause first they were juveniles. The more we researched into it, 'cause I frankly hadn't handled many cases because we hadn't had this much dynamic and tragic abuse of an animal. And particularly someone's pet and so we found out that we're running into more and more roadblocks. - [Voiceover] Gucci and his owner Doug James headed to city court early this morning. There they saw one of the people accused of beating Gucci. - As it turns out when we went to court there were two juveniles and two adults who were involved. But one of them turned city evidence or state evidence, whatever, he turned against the other three. So there were four involved but only three went to trail. - The defense lawyers, they pursued it on the level that whatever these kids did wrong, it expanded beyond what they expected. They never intend, they tried to paint their intentions is not being to really harm the animal but just to get the girls attention which it obviously was far past that. - They really felt annoyed that this publicity, I mean the whole city was involved, the whole state was involved. And a lot of the southeast too. But they just felt annoyed I think that it was just a dog, it was just a dog. - Mobile's Gucci the dog has had his day in court. The puppy was seeking justice for the horrifying attack he suffered in May. - 19 year old Eddy Handy appeared in court today, he was the man accused of cruelty to animals against Gucci the dog, which you have been hearing for the last four months or so. - It took the judge just seconds to find Handy guilty and sentence him to the maximum penalty, which will be six months the Mobile Metro Jail and a 500 dollar fine. - [Doug] The significance of that was, this was the first time ever that anyone of us had heard that anybody went to jail for cruelty to animals. So we thought that we made that point. - I think that clearly shows and gives a sign that how much the judge believed in the defendants guilt and also wanted to be sure and send a word out to this community that animal abuse will not be tolerated. - [Shauna] Getting you know six months in jail and, I don't think it was long enough. The one thing that gives me peace is knowing that everyday that they wake up and they look themselves in the mirror they have to know what they did. - It's strange that we love animals but as far as getting laws to protect them for some reason we're afraid of it, I don't know what it is. I wish I knew. I think the thing that struck me the most was I kept thinking of (mumbles) I said this is something that doesn't happen, this is just something that is not real. This is something that is just straight from the worst imaginations or the worst horror story you could think of. - Obviously I was not standing right there when they, you know, beat him. So, but whether you were the one who grabbed the lighter fluid or whether you were the one that stood there and watched it happened, you're as guilty and as sick as everyone else that allowed it to happen that night. I have to carry my, you know issue that you know I couldn't protect Gucci more. And that maybe I made bad choices but he has to live with the fact that he was a part of it. - I really got the impression that it was all of them involved, they were all just slapping him around and having a good time because he was a poor helpless little animal. (slow music) - This is where it all began. Where someone found a puppy severely burned, beaten and covered with maggots. - First time I ever heard about Susie, it was August of 2009 and was brought to my attention that she had been found in a park, local park here in Greensboro. And had suffered second and third degree burns over most of her body. Her ears had been burned off, her stomach was burned very severely. Places on her back were burned very severely. And so I was assigned the case here in Guilford County in order to prosecute it. - Her owner did this to her because she licked his baby in the face. - He took it as being aggressive behavior. So he snatched Susie up. - He beat her up for about 15 minutes. - Took her outside on the patio, broke off one of those long lighters that you light like a grill or something like that. Kind of filtered out the lighter fluid onto Susie's back and body and at that point set her on fire. - [Donna] And she was found 10 days later by a guy walking in the park. And he saw this poor little puppy laying there and like I said they estimated by the amount of maggots on her, she had over 300 maggots on her, that she was probably in this park for 10 days. - [Voiceover] How old was she at this point? - She was eight weeks old. When she was in foster care, that first couple of months, I saw this little puppy and the foster parents went on vacation and they asked me to stay with her for a week 'cause they couldn't take her with her 'cause she couldn't go outside 'cause of infection. She couldn't be around any other dogs, that she had to stay in this room kind of gated off just because of germs and stuff, that's how bad her burns were. So I went to visit the puppy because I was friends with the foster mom and I fell in love with this dog. But when I adopted Susie, the district attorney came to my salon one day to talk to me. And he said Donna, we caught the guy that did this to Susie. We got a court date set and you will be subpoena to go to court because you're her owner. And I would love for you to bring Susie to court. So people can see what he did to her, although he's not gonna get any jail time. - It was impossible, no matter what the facts were in the case, he could not receive any jail time. There was no judge in the state of North Carolina with the authority to send him to jail. No district attorney could send him to jail. It was in fact the law of the state. - Then what's the point. You know why do I even need to show up with her. I was really nervous about her facing him, I didn't know how she would act. And he said but Donna we can make a powerful impact here about animal cruelty. You know all the media will be there, you know I really think it would help animals if you could just bring her. - [Christopher] Our system now runs from the worst offense of being first degree murder which would be a Class A felony down to the lowest level felony offense, which there are several which would be a Class I felony. And at the time that was exactly what animal cruelty was in North Carolina, it was a Class I felony which was the lowest level felony in the state. - So people were outraged, the whole community was there. We had the court room packed and the district attorney said everybody here for Susie please stand up. The whole court room stood up. - Animals are considered to be property, personal property. And burning of personal property in the state North Carolina is a Class H felony which is one level higher than the Class I felony that we just discussed. So I indited the defendant for the burning of personal property, the personal property being the dog, which under our structured sentencing guidelines at the time, would allow him to be sentenced to prison time. So the irony is that you could burn property and it was actually stated in court that it equated to burning a sofa. So you could get more time for burning somebody's sofa than you could for burning somebody's animal. - [Voiceover] Lashaun Whitehead admitted setting Susie on fire. He received four to six months in prison for burning personal property plus a four to five month suspended sentence for animal cruelty. - We said we've got to do something about this, we need to change. This law needs to change. - I said to them and I think it actually was in this very room, you got to contact the legislator. Because we can't change the law, the legislator has to change the law. We operate as prosecutors, defense attorney's, judge's, anybody in the criminal system. We operate with the laws that are given to us by our legislator. I said you've got to go see them. And I was absolutely pleasantly surprised that they went straight to the legislator. They went and, I believed they even asked me, well who do we see? And I said, well go see Don Vaughan. - In Susie's case, the law was totally inadequate. The judge could do community service and do a fine and other things and once we researched the law, we realized that, that law had been on the books for well over 100 years. We drafted a bill, got it prepared and I found a blank bill to be able to put Susie's law into. Which would actually make those that abuse animals for the first time in North Carolina history go to jail for that abuse. - [Voiceover] On Sunday, Susie supporters canvas neighborhoods, looking for help. - Hey Dr. Kaylan, how are you? - [Voiceover] What we hope is that they write letters to our state representatives and our senators and our legislators to let them know that we want to see a change in our animal cruelty law. - [Voiceover] It gives the judge discretion. Depending on the case, depending on the amount of abuse. And depending on the perpetrators prior record. - [Roberta] In Jun of 2010 we went to the Governors mansion for the signing of the bill. - [Voiceover] The Pit-Shepard mix came to Rowley to put her paw of approval on a bill she inspired. - [Don] The team behind Susie Rowley, when I needed them at the legislator they brought an army of volunteers. Nobody got paid in this thing. There wasn't any big fund or anything at that time but they all drove down to the state capitol of Rowley. They all sat there on the front row. Susie in her finest pearls and her burned back showed up at the legislator thanks to the volunteers that helped. And they sent cards, they sent letters, they sent emails, they sent faxes to legislators to support Susie's Law. You gotta know that the people are behind you. If not, you're not gonna vote for it. Those in office think about there own constituents and those constituents have got to right to give you that comfort level to go the extra mile on a bill. And that's what Susie's Law had. I think one of the greatest things was Facebook. And to be able actually to see a picture of this poor animal. And see others that are out there all across the state that are supporting you. Everyday a legislator will probably get five or six hundred emails from people. When 25 or 30 everyday are about Susie, it certainly gets your attention. - And it doesn't matter who you are, if you believe in it, get behind it. You can make a difference. We do have a voice. You know Susie became the voice for all the animals in North Carolina who had no voice before Susies's Law. - And instead of just asking why and why is it this way, they not only ask those questions, they went to the next level and went to the legislator and said, it shouldn't be this way and changed it. - [Voiceover] And as for little Gucci, his owner says after some more surgery he will be on his way to a full recovery. And Gucci's lawyers says the national exposure his client is getting may help Gucci to get a new job. - [George] Well we certainly hope so. We'd like Gucci to be an effective spokesdog for other animals who are abused. I've received calls from all over the country, people who are concerned about the dog. People really want to see justice done to try to keep animal rights in the full front of the news. - Mary Zoghby who's an Alabama legislator called me one day and said, Doug I have written a bill for animal protection. And is that okay, sure it's okay. - Well like many citizens, I read about the plight of Gucci, in the newspaper. My sister had lived on that same street so I was familiar with the area. I was really horrified when I saw what had happened to that little puppy. And shortly thereafter I started looking at Alabama's laws knowing that there had to be something done to correct this situation with perpetrators. And to raise the penalties for animal cruelty in general. So I asked our bill drawing entity legislative reference service to research the laws that we had and to draw up a new law. Based upon stiffer penalties for people mistreating household pets. - And so then that's when Lynne Fridley got involved and so several of us were going over to Montgomery, the state capitol to do our politicking, to do what we could. And we were visiting the various offices of the various members of the legislator, we were really trying to find somebody who would take this as a project. - Gucci and Doug James came to the legislator and that's what started turning the tide. Gucci was our spokesdog. Gucci was the face of animal cruelty in Alabama. - [Voiceover] Gucci and his story were spotlighted as James started working for tougher animal cruelty laws in Alabama. State legislator Mary Zoghby and Lynne Fridley wrote and pushed a bill to make domestic dog or cat abuse a felony. - In state government and even in Washington, killing a bill is relatively easy. Getting something positive done is really hard work. Trying something new is tough but it was the dream team, between Doug James and this beautiful but disfigured dog. They were opening doors like I had never seen at the time. Whether or not it was Governor Folsom, Governor James or Governor Segalman who ultimately signed the bill, it was personal. All of these guys and their wives, their families, they had dogs. And so this wasn't about an individual case, this was about probably a lot of inspection and thinking about their own animals and their own families and what if. - I think so many of them though were afraid that they'd be seen as kind of soft or whatever because I didn't want to make people think that they were more involved with animal welfare than there were with people welfare. - It is amazing that something so pure and is so simple as the intent of this bill, would have cause confusion. But in the world of legislation with paid lobbyist worrying about what if scenarios. I think the phrase that one of the top lawmakers in Montgomery used to use, that's the camels nose under the tent. If this, it's gonna be something else tomorrow. And this is the beginner kit for freedoms being taken away. And in agriculture, you know what's that fine line between animal harvesting and animal abuse and inevitably there are gray areas and those who are paid to be careful and prevent things from happening way on down the road. I'd argue they were being exceedingly careful. - I think anything, we've got a lot of agriculture, we've got a lot of hunters in the south and I think a lot of people feel that this would have something to do affecting farming, animal husbandry, affecting sport hunting. And that was a point that we tried to make with the bill, this was about companion animals. This was about people who just deliberately torture, maim and kill just because that's what they want to do. It's not about making a living, it's not about hunting for food or anything like that. - I think it's interesting too that they, we had the bill was originally for all animals. And the only way we could get it passed was for cats and dogs. - There was another legislator who said the way that I read this bill, I cannot put a side of beef in my freezer, I can't kill a food animal like this. There's nothing there but people had these wrong ideas about it and they were afraid of it. - [Julie] We went to a committee meeting, I think we went to the house committee meeting and then I remember-- - Is that where the guy complained about the dog going, peeing on his Augusta grass and-- - That was on the house floor. That was actually the debate in the house floor. As Jacque said-- - They decided to call it the pee pee bill, excuse me you could cut this out but-- (laughing) - I call it the pee and poop exception is what I call it now. - [Jacque] He says if my neighbors Jack Russell comes over and pees on my whatever, Augusta grass, I have a right to shoot him and kill him. - [Julie] We were sitting in the gallery in the house and while the debate on the bill was going on, basically what was coming out of a lot of the debate was my wife, my child, my dog, don't tell me what to do. This issue came up and he talked about chasing off the dog or using a BB-gun and they put an exception into the law for if you shoot with a BB-gun at a dog that is urinating or defecating on your lawn that you're accepted out of it. So it was rather an interesting um-- - [Voiceover] And that's in the final law? - That's in the final law and yeah. So that's how laws, you know it's the old saying, there's two things you don't want to see being made, laws and sausage. - But it's ridiculous, I mean when you look at legislation and they attack on things like that I mean that's embarrassing. It should be embarrassing to the legislator that wanted it tacked on to begin with. It should be embarrassing for the people that live here that elect these officials to do that work. It should be embarrassing to everybody that lives in this state. I mean we're in Alabama we already feel like we're at the low end of the pole here as far as progressiveness and then we get this idiotic amendments that make no sense just because one of our lawmakers has a neighbors dog that comes over and pees on it's bush. - So many times, someone will come to you with an idea that's somewhat abstract. There is nothing abstract about a dogs ears who's ears have been burned off. There's no one that could say, hey this kind of thing doesn't really happen in Alabama. This kind of thing really doesn't happen, there are no people so heartless that would do something like that when that animals you know through that scar tissue face was looking out. And frankly making some great press. - [Lynne] A person commits the crime of cruelty to a dog or cat in the first degree if he or she intentionally tortures any dog or cat or skins a domestic dog or cat. Offers for sale or exchange or offers to buy or exchange the fur (mumbles) of a domestic dog or cat. Cruelty to a dog or cat in the first degree is a class C felony. - [Don] I won't speak for most states, you'll find the state of Alabama can be slow to change in a lot of it's laws concerning animals. It's more like well if it's been there that long, let's just leave it. Kind of keep things a status quo and Doug James did a exemplary job of convincing the lobbyist and the legislators Why the the status quo was no longer good enough. Why the status quo was no longer right. Why the status quo should not be the course Alabama took at that stage. (slow music) - Of all the cases I handle, Gucci is in certainly probably the top 10 if not the top 5 on cases that have stood out. That have made a difference, that kind of mold you and shape you and kind of awaken your consciousness to hey, we need to be alert to what's happening around us. We need to open our eyes and see, not just read about it in the paper, not just see it on TV, but to take an act of standing, doing something about it like Doug James did. And he's the hero of this story. - I know that once I was in North Alabama to go into Huntsville to the Books-A-Million to sell books. And I had an appointment over in Florida to another Books-A-Million. And I called the Florida store and said look there's so many people in the store I'm gonna be delayed about an hour. But when we arrived in Florida at the mall, there were people still waiting for him. (chuckles) And really the rock star, when he arrived people just cheered for him. And he walked in, he was so proud, he knew exactly what was going on. So yeah, he had that rock start quality. I often thought he looked like Big Bird and this is one of the shots where I think he looked like Big Bird (chuckles) at one of his signings. And this was also at one of the book signings. He would take to this just like it was all apart of his life. He was supposed to be where he was. We made so many trips to so many groups who where doing fund raisers and Gucc was a guest of honor. But I believe this was up in Tuscaloosa, we went and we were given this brave heart award. This was for Gucci of course. You know the first time we made an appearance, we went into the door of the school and they had the big sign up there, hero. And I wasn't sure, are they talking about me the hero and I didn't say anything about it but I wanted to ask 'cause I thought Gucci was the hero. I just happened, I'm just his driver. - It was the morning of September the 7th. I remember it very plainly. It was a normal morning and we got a call from The Humane Society telling us that they had a transport dog on the way that had been set on fire and burned very badly. Within a matter of minutes, they showed up with Louis. We didn't know his name at the time but shortly thereafter he told us what his name would be. And Louis when he arrived was still hot to the touch. The original plan unfortunately was to euthanize Louis. All the literature that you will read on burned dogs, tells you that if they have full thickness burns over more than 30 percent of their body that humane euthanasia is the best recommendation at that time. But, we drew up the euthanasia solution and I walked in to look at Louis and he looked up at me through those swollen burned lids and squinted little eyes and he wagged his tail. I couldn't do it. So tears streaming, turned around and walked back out. Came back, looked at him again and again and a world of pain that I can't even imagine. He looked up at me and he wagged his tail again and I knew that this wasn't a typical dog. He wasn't ready to give up and without a doubt he wanted to live. And one of my technicians knelt down and as soon as she knelt down he walked over and he crawled up into her lap. And we decided at that point that as long as Louis wanted to go, we would fight for him every second. - My deputy contacts me on the scene, I advised what he had. He said that the dog had been beaten with a shovel and or a stick and then some type of flammable liquid had been poured on the dog. And then the dog had been set a fire. - [Dr. Holladay] I'm a graduate of Auburn University and was of course living in Alabama was familiar with the story of Gucci and his injuries. And I knew as soon as we saw Louis Vuitton that, that would be his name. We named him Louis Vuitton after a designer in honor of Gucci and the Gucci Law that was on the books now in Alabama. - 'Course for our investigation we talked to the mother and the mother told us that her son Juan Daniels, who's our suspect, apparently had been on a drug and alcohol fueled binge. He wanted to use the vehicle, which was a Ford Excursion that belonged to her. And he was hopped up on ecstasy and tequila and marijuana. His mother told him that he could not use the vehicle and so therefore in order to get back at her, he took a leash and he chained the dog to a carport. Took a shovel and beat the dog into submission and then poured charcoal lighter fluid all over the dog and set the dog on fire. (slow music) After we received this information of course we automatically know that it's gonna be a felony, we're gonna charge the suspect with. At that point in time we need to start looking for the suspect. It took us a little over two weeks to track down Juan Daniels. - The shelter had mailed out a letter a little small picture of Louis. And telling about what had happened to him and that they would be raising funds for his treatment. And not telling of his location because that was kept confidential for awhile. But to tell everybody that they needed funds for his medical care because his injuries were very severe. And the story broke, I think the first time we saw it was on the nightly news, the local nightly news. I just kept telling William, I want that dog. I want that dog, I know that. That's all I could think about. And William kept saying we don't need that dog, but I kept feeling he needed us. For some reason I just had a really strong tug in my heart that we really, we could do something for him. - Started going to see the guy, at lunch everyday we'd meet out there and they encouraged us to bring him anything that we thought a dog might like to eat. So we pretty much did. He kind of liked us 'cause he got McDonald's hamburgers and cheeseburgers and Vienna Sausage and you know whatever but... So that's how we got introduced to him. It worked out pretty well for us. I think we've done pretty well with him but I know it's really done us a lot of good. - Now I knew there was a relatively new law, I didn't know a lot of history about it because our law became effective in 2000 but we hadn't in Montgomery used it. But you begin to think, wasn't there something and when you hit the books and you find it, you went yes! We've got a felony. - I know for Alabama, that he got the longest sentence in state history for one count of animal cruelty. Which is the maximum sentence to 10 years. - [Voiceover] Were you still nonetheless surprised when he got the maximum? - No, not at all. Pleased, yes. Relieved, certainly. - Ecstatic. Ecstatic-- - We were. - As a matter of fact Judge Price had warned everybody there was a courtroom full, they're supporting Louis. All the humane shelter staff and people just you know, people in the public that had been following the case and knew about that. And we were all there, we had a packed courtroom. And first thing Judge Price says is you know when we announce the sentencing there's no outcries, no comments. And still there were, there were because people were so excited. I happened to go on Facebook and saw where there was a petition to deny parole for Juan Daniels, already circulating. - I went to the prison system and I got a copy of his records in prison. And unfortunately for him, he had not been a good inmate. So I thought we had a great shot at keeping him in prison. And of course the best witness was Louis Vuitton himself. And it was a stroke of genius when the Hartley's stopped to bring him to the parole hearing. The parole board unanimously denied his parole and to this day Juan Daniels remains in prison. He'll get out, we all know that. We pray he's learned his lesson, but my fear based on his prison behavior is he will be in trouble again. - A lot of things have changed since then. Now we hear phrases on the street, don't mess around with the animal cops, they'll put you in jail. We've heard that a couple of times. I think that since the Louis Vuitton case, especially the residents of Montgomery County, Alabama know that we mean business. We're serious. We're a law enforcement agency, we're not dog catchers. - I have learned in my 30 years of being a prosecutor that good laws get passed only after a tragedy. It takes a rallying cry. It takes some reason for people to focus around an issue and push and push and push. - The minute a person gets involved, they've made a difference. The minute they pick up that phone, they make a phone call, hey this is going on at my neighbors house or hey, when I was at the grocery store I saw this car with a dog locked in it. We're not gonna know about the situation unless someone calls us and tells us about it. So the minute they call, they have made a difference. - We have to take a stand. Social media is a great tool and it can get people really riled up and get things done. - When I was 12 I wanted to do something more to help so I created NYC Teen for Animals. It started out as a small Facebook, you know to raise awareness and share some causes and share the dogs I work with personally. A couple years later John the dog came in. So I took pictures of him, posted them on the page and we started sharing his daily updates. People started liking the page from all over the world. He was about 18 pounds when he first came in, which was extremely, extremely underweight. He probably should have weighed somewhere around 65 pounds. We couldn't even tell he was alive, the only way you could tell was because he was blinking. He couldn't even wag his tail or lift his head. And he started to get better and better and it was really one of the first dogs that I had really, really helped nurse back to health from such a horrible condition. It's hard with animals because they can't tell you what's wrong, they can't call for help. It's really up to people to do the right thing. If they see something, say something. I mean you can't just say, oh it's not my problem, somebody else will do something about it. - Social media is amazing in the fact that you can reach so many people in two seconds. And I think that's another thing people can do, is when you see those stories on your news feed that friend shared about this poor dog that was abused, share it. Read it 'cause eventually you're gonna get fed up with it. You're gonna say I need to do something because this is just getting to me. I did one or two stories just covering different cruelty cases throughout Mobile County which was, several. I mean there was at least you know two a week that we could have done. And I started getting calls, just a lot of calls from different rescue groups. They called me every time there was a different cruelty case and that's how Linda got in touch with me and said, hey I got a bill to pass and I want you to help. - [Voiceover] She's pushing a bill designed to impose harsher penalties for animal cruelty and neglect. - [Voiceover] In 2012 we're still having to put, you know tools in the hands of the judges and in the hands of the prosecutors to say we're not gonna allow animal abuse. - Gucci's Law kind of laid the ground work, in the sense that there is a law. - [Voiceover] Now abusing a domestic dog or cat is a felony in Alabama. A legacy that Dr. James is proud of, but he believes more can be done. - It does not take into account livestock, it does not take into account stray dogs or any other animals. - The new law, A made it easier to prosecute. It changed the wording to where you'll only have to prove the act was malicious rather than the intent was malicious. - It makes torture, prolonged animal cruelty, severe cases of neglect, it makes it a felony. - The bill passed the Alabama house with no opposition, passed the senate committee. Again no opposition but over the weekend, the Alabama Game Fowl Breeders Association took a stance against the bill. The group is standing up for cock fighting which is already legal. - And there issue was that they didn't want this bill to apply to them. It's an illegal activity so for it not to apply to them it really amazed me that we had to take that and put that amendment in there. However we had to put it in there because when you're writing a bill and when you're going through a bill, you have to be able to compromise. - [Voiceover] Nearly 5,000 of you signed Fox 10 News online petition to strengthen laws protecting animals. And today with the passage of HB27, you were heard. - 31 eyes, one day and one extension. Final passage as amended has occured. - When I first got involved with covering stories concerning animal cruelty that was the first thing people told me about, was Gucci. And that's the first thing I tell people about when I'm explaining the issue in Alabama. Whenever I think of Gucci I try to smile because of the happy ending that that dog received. And that he should have never been in that position in the first place. But what a blessing that dog was to the entire state of Alabama. For getting the ball rolling, it took a very long time, but I don't think the law that we passed could have been passed as quickly as it did. It wouldn't have been passed you know it wouldn't be there without Gucci. - I think it has a very positive impact for people's perceptions of animals as not just only being possessions. And so you know Doug's roll in that is not inconsequential. - This is a man that was standing on his front porch that didn't know what was coming. - I cannot take any credit for what happened. I just rescued him and I was glad, and my mother, I told you was a great animal lover and she had died a couple years before. But I don't know how far these things go but I wondered many times. See the first time, the first night George Swan was supposed to come look at the house, he didn't show up. The second night I stood outside to make sure he knew this house was safe. And I often wondered if somehow (chuckles) my mother had me out there, waiting for this to happen so I could take over. I've often thought about that but no I was just a participant. But Gucci was the one who really gets the credit. - You know he was very, very proud of his role in allowing something very positive to come from something that was pretty negative. - [Doug] It is the funniest thing here, if I go any place and people know him, had no idea who I was. It was always fun, I didn't mind that he was the star. (chatter) I was talking to a fella the other day and he always calls me Mr. Gucci, can't remember my name but Mr. Gucci. The Playhouse in the Park which is just a few blocks form here actually, was doing a production of the musical Annie. Said I've got Gucci and of course they knew Gucci and said could we see if he could play the part of Sandy 'cause I think he looks like Sandy. The right color and the right size so sure bring him down so I went down and he was just perfect, he was just perfect. And of course he loved the kids and the kids loved him. So that was one of the things, people would come to the play because of him. And the Mobile Press Register was wonderful, I've got this one shot of Gucci, his publicity shot. And he's looking into the camera and he's got this intelligent, happy quizzical look on his face and I thought that's gonna sell to this play. So people would come to see the play because he was in it. He was in it three times over the years which was really great. - [Annie] I said don't worry I'm not gonna let them get you or me, I'll take care of you. And everything's going to be fine for the both of us. If not today well, * The sun will come out tomorrow... - But he was a publicity hound. He literally loved publicity. And when the camera would come out he would get so excited. And when I'd put him in the car to go places and he'd see the crowds there he would just light up. And he would go into that crowd just like I'm gonna get all the votes I can. He was number one, he was always top dog. And I have, this was his favorite toy. This was a bear that I guess I bought for him, I can't remember. But the strange thing, any time he'd get an animal, a pet, a toy like this. Since his ears were gone, he would always take off the ears. It was the strangest thing. I don't know if he had some sort identity crises or what but he'd take off the ears and he'd take off the label and that was the rest of it. He would leave the rest the way it is, but this was his favorite. - [Voiceover] And the other question I want to ask, The Gucci Gram? - [Doug] That was just a little way of letting people know what was going on in Gucci's life. Because at that time he had a big following, just a number of people and-- - [Voiceover] Would you actually hand mail those? - [Doug] Yes, they're all done by hand, but that was my life at the time. It really took up just about all my time. Which was fine, I didn't mind that at all. (slow music) - [Liz] We really had a wonderful relationship when we considered him and his wife our good friends. We celebrated with them, went out to dinner with them. I mean we spent, I just don't want people to think that we picked his kennel like out of the yellow peaches and didn't do our homework 'cause we most definitely did. And a few years later my dad who lives out of state suddenly was stricken with cancer. And he was by himself so I had to go of course and be wit him. And Nitro was not always the easiest dog. I mean there I will not lie, I mean he did require an experienced handler. - Liz's father lives in New Jersey, it's about three to four hours away from here. It wasn't a close trip so it was tough to go down there with the two dogs and handle two dogs down there. - I thought it best, that rather than him sit in a kennel in New York that we would bring him to Ohio where he could be with Steve and also work on his training and be well cared for. We would call, sometimes I would talk to him two, three times a week and he assured us he was doing very, very well. His training was excellent and in fact his favorite place to lay in the kennel yard was under a big oak tree. We had called and Tom spoke to Steve and Steve said you know what Nitro's doing very well, why don't you leave him a few more weeks while you take care of all these odds and ends and catch up at home and catch up at work. And I said you know what Tom, that's a great idea. Let's do that. Let's get everything, all of our affairs in order. About a week or two later we kept trying to get him on the phone. When we called him on the phone he didn't always call back the same day. Many times it would be the next morning, I mean after all he's running a business and he's busy too. And then when we didn't hear back from him, basically I was only trying to get a hold of him to tell him that we were coming to Ohio that Saturday to pick Nitro up. And I can't even begin to tell you how excited I was. That Saturday morning I got up about five in the morning, I went to the computer because I remembered as part of the references was one of the men that we had met during training and he lived very close to the kennel. So I went to go on to get his full name so I could look up his phone number and give him a call. And when I typed in the name of the kennel-- - [Voiceover] Steven Crowley the owner of High Caliber K-9 Boarding and Training Facility, entered a not guilty plea to animal cruelty charges. After police and humane agents found seven dead dogs and eight starving dogs at his business. - And I heard Liz from the other room scream at the top of her lungs, Tom get in here. - At this point we didn't know where he was, if he was clinging to life because they said that many of the dogs were taken to the humane society. And they were feeding them very slowly and trying to nurse them back to health. - We got to Ohio late that evening. The first place we went to, we went to the police department in Hubbard and they told us where all the animals had been brought to. I think it was animal charities at the time. So the following day we went to the humane place, the animal charities as it's called. And we were talking to one of the humane agents and we were asking the humane agents about a Rottweiler and the humane agent said, no there was no Rottweiler here, we don't have a Rottweiler, there was no Rottweiler taken. He did say he had a doberman and I said well let's just see if this, what this doberman looks like. Since you're telling me that there was no Rottweiler. We went into the basement of the animal charities and they went down and there was a meat locker freezer like they have a chest freezer and he pulled out a body bag. And in that body bag was my dog. Okay when we dropped him off, he weighed 105 pounds. And I had them weigh him and he weighed 45 pounds, frozen solid. Okay his nails were split open from him trying to escape. It was just horrible, his ribs were protruding through the sides of his skin. And he was chipped when he was born, we had him chipped before we brought him home and then they micro-chipped and they micro-chipped him and it was my dog. It was my boy, it was him. It was him. He was dead. He was shriveled up in a fetus position and I'll never forget that. It's embedded in my brain for the rest of my life. - [Voiceover] For the past two weeks the couples been trying to reach the owner of High Caliber, Steven Crowley, to arrange an appointment to pick up their dog. Then over the weekend they come to find out the shocking news, the dogs were starving to death that were being boarded at that kennel. - Starvation doesn't just happen over night. This wasn't a case of, I forgot to feed the dogs one night. I mean this was repeatedly, over and over and over. Nitro was the only dog found at the kennel with absolutely no bowl in his kennel. Because what he would do if he was hungry or thirsty and his bowl was empty, he would pick it up and he would just throw it. - And I can't imagine how many times he must have in that kennel flung that thing while that S.O.B. stood in that house and heard that and did nothing about it. - And I know that he removed them because I'm sure he just kept throwing his bowls. But nobody ever came and filled them. The next thing I know, I mean I'm at the prosecutors office and he explains to Tom and I that animal cruelty in Ohio is just a misdemeanor, no matter how horrific the crime. And we just couldn't believe this. I mean I was speechless. And I just knew that, that couldn't possibly just be acceptable. - [Voiceover] Another question has to do with the charges. Crowley was originally charged with 19 counts of animal cruelty and neglect but was arraigned on only four counts in court. - The humane agents didn't obtain a search warrant. So 14,15 of those charges were dropped down to four. It seems that at the time in Ohio there was no certification required. No training was required. And while these agents thought they were doing the right thing by immediately going into the kennel and trying to help these dogs. Only the four dogs that they were able to see from the neighbors yard, were the four counts that were allowed. Nitro was not one of those counts. - So we knew we that had to do something, for those dogs that day. And that's when Liz thought of Nitro Foundation. - And I said I'm going to enact change. And I'm gonna change this law, I don't care how long it takes, how hard it is. I don't care how many people tell me no, we're gonna do this. - [Voiceover] Question is, shall the bill pass. House will prepare and proceed to vote. Both members now voted. Clerk will take the roll, 59 yeas, 38 nays. Therefore having received the required constitutional majority, the bill is hereby passed and entitled. - [Liz] Well the biggest thing it's done is instead of being just a misdemeanor, it will be a felony of the fifth degree. - [Voiceover] Some call it a victory, years in the making. As Governor John Kasich signs Nitro's Law. The Law will now make animal abuse a fifth degree felony for kennels that mistreat pets. A problem Kasich recently told us that needs to stop. They're gods creatures and they need to be treated with respect and love. And when people don't do it, they need to be held accountable. - No, not at all. No, no, closure, I'll never get him back. They'll never change what happened to him. The only closure it gives us is that at least he didn't die in vein, if that's what you want to know about closure. Then yes. - Till this day I still feel guilty. I mean while I didn't do it of course, I made the decision to put him there. You know and, they count on us. - If you do not think animals should be tortured, abused, neglected, go to your legislators. Those folks who are elected by you will listen if you can rally them. Email, visit, write letters. Secondly, talk to your prosecutors. The people who have the ability to bring these charges or not and work with them. Train them, educate them. And thirdly, when a case gets made don't walk away, be there. Let people know you're watching. Too often I walk into court and I look around and there may be somebody up there for the defendant, but I look around and frequently the victim, human or not is standing pretty much alone. - We need to have people that are active in the way our laws work. If there's a law passed and it's a felony and the law enforcement isn't gonna enforce it or the prosecutor is not gonna prosecute it, what good is the law? - And it goes right back to, which I find very offensive, the statement of it's only an animal, it's only a dog. Well it's a living thing. You know it's alive, it breathes, it feels. - People need to see animal abuse differently. They need to see it as an actual issue which a lot of people don't. - Gucci was never an animal problem. It was always a people problem. And people need to take that and own it. - [Doug] I've said many times that he was probably the perfect dog. And even when I fussed at him, he would just look at me and like this is alright. You know some dogs tuck their tails under and carry on but if he did something bad I'd say you were a bad boy and he would, okay I can handle that. But he would never show any real remorse but he would just stick and follow a way through. - Gucci the dog is famous for toughening the consequences for animal cruelty. Yesterday Gucci died. - He was arthritic and he just gave out. He could no longer get up and move around and function normally. And Doug was carrying him down steps and outside for weeks before he could finally come to terms with letting him go. They were very bonded. Gucci, I remember we euthanized him in exam room four, which is further down the hall. And Gucci was just in lateral recumbency. He was just laying flat on his side and that's really all he could do He couldn't even get sternal at that point. And Doug was just crying and you know trying to maintain his composure but struggling with that. - After what that dog went through he was so kind and he was so loving and you'd see him, there'd be children all over him. There'd be people all over him. We'd be at the Greater Gulf State Fair, we'd be at a pet store or we'd be at the mall and it didn't phase Gucci a bit. He did love everybody. It's amazing and I think that's what people reach out to 'cause they see the dog. And animals are so forgiving, they're not like people. They do, they give and they give and Gucci gave and gave. - [Doug] He just never lost that wonderful spirit of loving life and loving people and being a happy boy. - [Voiceover] Gucci who died of old age earlier this week found a peaceful end and a loving home. Exactly what he deserved. - He thought he was beautiful and in his own way, he was. You know saving one dog is not gonna save the world. But it saved his world. - In some weird way (clears throat) what happened to Gucci probably saved my life. And I think in some weird way it saved Doug's life. I think it gave both of us purpose. - When Gucci died, I had him cremated. And had him put in this little box here. So I could have him even though I didn't have him so I have him here and every morning when I get up, I give him his good morning and then when I go to bed at night I give him his goodnight. So it's still kind of like I still have him. (slow music) Anybody who could see what had happened to that dog would have to be moved and would have to speak up or step up or do something. - [Don] Doug James was the quarter back, the offensive line, the running back and the wide receivers on this team. He did it all. And the head coach for that matter. - [Voiceover] (chuckles) Okay, what was Gucci? - [Don] Gucci was a star athlete, Gucci scored some touchdowns on his own. He sure did, I guess the center 'cause he's the one who kind of snapped the ball and took off down the field. - It's happening everywhere, everyday. And it's not just stray dogs, it's not just kids that are bad apples that are finding animals and abusing them. And I think you need to open your eyes to that, because it's easy to ignore those stories when you see it, oh I don't want to look at that, I don't want to look at that but you have to look at that. You have to look at that and say that's wrong. And you have to make a stand for it because obviously animals don't have a voice. * Every animal is my friend * Every animal is my friend * I've been here before * I've been here before * People are the worst of all * People are the worst of all * I've been here before * I've been here before * I'll never hurt an animal * But if you raise your hand * If you raise your hand * Every animal is my friend * Every animal is my friend * I've been here before * I've been here before * I've been here beore * I've been here beore * I've been here before - There are a lot of Gucci's out there, unfortunately. But um-- - I think Doug James. - I was gonna say-- - Was the perfect storm. - Yeah. - I think, so that's hard to say obviously but Doug James just stuck with it. - I mean he obviously had the perseverance to do it, he had the passion and he had the bravery to step forward and say something needs to be done about this. He had the bravery to step forward and rescue a little puppy. - [Matt] It's important to remember The Gucci Bill, this is something where people did something. Not even people, really just one person. It made a huge difference you know so when in doubt as to whether or not a person can make a difference, they can. And if you don't know that for sure, think about Gucci. (slow music)
