Really, I thought this wasn't happening till like next year. Yeah, but then I thought, what difference? Sooner the better. Right up till the moment they chop his head off, the goat thinks he's going for a walk in the park. Bastard, you're just too negative. I hate this attitude. Listen, this is great news. Come here, give me a hug. Great news! Fucker, I was looking for these - - your ass is like a solar eclipse, man. Listen she's too hot, I was going to marry her myself, but you can have her. She's too sexy, you lucky bastard! He's moving out. You're moving out? Then why the fuck were you going on about the rent? Tashi, you really should shave, baby. Hello? Menaka? Yes - Tashi?
