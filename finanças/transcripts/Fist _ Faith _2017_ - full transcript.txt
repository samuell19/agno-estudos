Timing and Subtitles by Clenched Fists Team 👊🏼 @ Viki ​ [Produce by: Black And (Shanghai) Film Co., Ltd.] [Co-production: Atom Cinema Co., Ltd.] [Starring: Jing Tian. Ou Hao] [Starring: Meisa Kuroki. Kento Hayashi] [Fist and Faith] [In 1932, Japanese invaders established the state of Manchukuo in northeastern China,] [with Emperor Puyi installed as a puppet ruler.] [Enslavement education was implemented throughout the state.] [Chinese publishers were raided. Progressive intellectuals were arrested and persecuted.] [Publisher stars] [Boom!!] [The Japanese invaders used such methods to] [destroy Chinese culture and history,] [splitting the northeast of the country from the motherland.] [Progressive teachers and students formed an underground to keep Chinese culture alive amid the darkness.] [However, they were met with bloody suppression by the Japanese military police.] That's the Gao family's second Young Master Jue Min and the Third Young Master, Jue Hui. Facing the fury of Manchukuo residents and international pressure, [The Japanese Emperor ordered the Kwantung Army cease suppressing the activities of students reading club by force.] [Emperor Hirohito] [But this is just the start of the story...] [Fist and Faith] [Qing He Boys High School] [Qing He Boys High School] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [Ah!] [Bang] Kill him! My name is A'Pi. (T/N: means fart) Of course, it's not my real name. Who the hell would have the surname "A" and the given name "Pi" (Fart)? Think about it carefully. Only through a firm belief in "two countries, one heart" can an everlasting friendship be built. [Fart] Quiet. Having such an unenviable nickname was not my intention. The name followed me like a shadow. I vowed to become the "Boss" of Qinghe Boys High and make A'Fart the most respected name in school. This is my 99th attempt to become the Boss of Qing He. Standing between me and the throne is the man currently inside the bathroom. Everyone should have guessed by now that I'm not the hero of this story. No hero makes an entrance like this. The man stepping on my face is this story's true hero. He's the Boss of Qing He Boys High School, Jing Hao. B-B-Boss. This school used to be ruled by Japanese students. Chinese students were at the bottom until this man appeared. Right away, he took out the Japanese student No. 2, Muto. Jing Hao became an instant school legend. These two are Jing Hao's henchmen: Peacock and Two Dots. They're natural-born killers. They had their own factions when Jing Hao arrived, but spent all their energy in endless battle with each other, unable to join forces versus the Japanese students. But if you ask me, this endless civil war had built up an extraordinary bond of friendship between them. Fighting is their mutual way of expressing emotions. Hurts, hurts, hurts! Chinese people… don't fight Chinese people! The man standing under the umbrella is Shibata. The two behind him are his leading henchmen. Before Jing Hao's arrival, Shibata ruled the school. I bet he never expected that Jing Hao, a 1st-year then, would be his biggest foe. Under Jing Hao's leadership, Chinese students finally united to resist the oppression and repentance of Japanese students for years. But in the end, neither could defeat the other. Watch where you're going! What did you say? This studious-looking guy is Tan Jiamu. He's Jing Hao's childhood friend, as well as his strategist. He was the one who ended Jing Hao and Shibata's war, making Qing He Boys High School the peaceful school it is today. No one knows what Tan Jiamu said to them that day, or how he managed to escape unscathed. From that point on he became like a firefighter, ensuring all conflicts between Chinese and Japanese students were put out before things got out of control. A'Pi. Apologize. I'm sorry. Takahashi. Apologize. Boss. I apologize. Jiayou! A'Pi. My guy isn't really feeling it today. Who else wants to be a challenger? You look really fierce. Your eyes are scary, too. It's a shame you were born this way. Come on, you're up. Come. This guy. Does anyone want to bet on this guy? Come. I'll bet on myself. Who wants to bet on my guy? - Me! Me! Me! - Me! Me! Me! 2 yuan. 5 yuan, 10 yuan. Yeah! One, two, three... Go! - I'm going to throw you down. - Jiayou! Jiayou! Why are you trying so hard? - I push and you fall. - Okay. One, two, three. You're really… good. It's a scam! Go! Are you stupid? "You're really good?" It's too obvious! Boss, you go first. Come at me! Stop! Ah! Excuse me. I'll just borrow these pants. He's here! Stop! Stop! Stop right there! [Bump!!] Hey! Letting all that blood rush to your brain isn't going to make you any smarter Leave me alone. I'm paying homage to my fleeting moment of love. Boss. New… new teacher. A teacher. A new teacher, so what? So pretty. - Where is she? - Th-there. Th-there. - Hi, teacher. - Hi, teacher. You've read this book? Hi, teacher. [Shout] Hi, teacher. Hi, teacher. Hi. The new teacher. Is she pretty? Fate. - Jiayou! - Jiayou! Jiayou! Peacock. Boss, I'm trying to act cool. Don't get so close to me. Gross. Boss. You make me… You had garlic. So what if I ate some garlic? You don't have to eat it, Boss. You must make her feel your dominance. Dominance? What if she slaps me, too? So what if she does? Dominance Hi, teacher. Hi. Hey, teacher. Teacher! What is it? I have a question I want to ask you. [Don't lean on it. Danger] [Kiyoko Shibata] You must never forget that you're the only heir to the Shibata family. The Shibata family is doomed if you keep this up. Sorry to keep you waiting. We dont' mind. We came to visit today the famous Shibata family in the hope that you can serve His Majesty the Emperor again. Have you heard of "reading societies"? I have heard of it. These societies distribute reactionary propaganda to divide Manchukuo and tout to oppose the idea of Greater East Asia. Therefore, we can't ignore these reading societies' activities, but it's inconvenient to use force against students. With that said, Chief Matsui hopes to use your brother to— In other words, if it's students beating students, the military can have plausible deniability. I'm sorry, Chief Matsui. I'm afraid— I'll do it. So, your brother is home after all. My dream is to serve His Majesty and the Imperial Army. How heroic of you. This is how a man from a warrior family should be. The Imperial Army won't forget the Shibata family's contribution. I'll leave it to you. Sorry. Smoking is not permitted in the dojo. (T/N: Dojo = a training hall) My apologies. We better get going then. A family fallen from grace has no right to be so cocky. [Shibata Family] You were too reckless today. It's not just Manchukuo, even Japan is ruled by the army now. We must rely on them to revive our family glory. Didn't you say I'm the only heir of the Shibata family? I don't want to see you bear this burden alone anymore. Allow me to carry some of your burdens. - Let's go! - Yes, sir! - Get up. - Brother, what are you doing? - What are you doing here? - Let go. Let go of me! Don't move. How many times has Mom told you? Don't get involved in these messy reading societies. Do you want to get beaten up by the Japanese? We can't just abandon our faith because of fear. These crappy books can become faith now? It's not just a reading society. Did you ever think about why, even though we speak Mandarin, our national literature classes are in Japanese? Or why we're only taught late Jin and Jurchen history but not the Qin, Han, Tang, and Song dynasties? Hi. I didn't write the textbooks. Then, let me ask you, why won't the Japanese let us learn our own culture? You'd have to ask the Japanese. Let me tell you, it's because the Japanese want to destroy our culture so we'll forget that we are Chinese. A nation is not conquered when it loses a war. It's when we all believe that we are so-called Manchus as opposed to Chinese that we truly become conquered people. That's why we're not simply reading here. We are keeping our culture alive and reminding ourselves that we are Chinese. Understand? It's like talking to a brick wall. Wait! You're coming home with me today no matter what. What are you doing? What do you want? Don't touch me. What teacher? Teacher Liu He. What are you doing here? Jin Qing. This teacher Liu He... Teacher Liu He is the founder of our reading society. - I'm here to join the reading society. - What? When my sister told me there's a reading society here, I made up my mind: I had to join. To bring down a nation, first, destroy its history. That's what the Japanese are doing in Manchuria now. The Japs recently cracked down on reading societies. Many students were killed or injured. Even so, we have many students gathered here today. They can try to suppress us, but reading societies will continue to exist. And as long as there are reading societies on this Manchurian land, our culture and history will continue to survive. And as long as they continue to survive, we will not become conquered people. Great! - Everyone clap! - Stop clapping. Liu He. Are you still messing around with your reading society? This is not China anymore. This is Manchukuo. For now. When he later came under the command of Oba Nobunaga, he was still just a errand servant. But Hideyoshi worked his assigned tasks earnestly, nor did he give up on his dream. Classmate Jing Hao. Classmate Jing Hao! Classmate Jing Hao! Teacher. Please tell me, what is your dream? To serve the country. Very good. How do you plan to serve? This… I haven't decided yet. Then how do you plan to realize your dream? - Making money first. - How will you make money? Playing Mahjong. What are you all laughing at? Mahjong is the essence of Chinese culture. Boss, some water. Two Dots, get the customers some water. South wind. We're playing Mahjong. - Wait! - South wind. "Pong"! What's wrong? Can I tell you something? Keep this a secret for me. My tiles aren't bad. Your turn! Your turn. Eight Dots. The boys in our family don't live past the age of twenty. Maybe... This is fate. So… I treat every day of my life - as though it were my last. - Hurry up. Fortune. I like you. Knowing I've loved you, I can now die with no regrets. Jing Jing. I have a disease. What disease? Don't infect me. Actually, I have a secret. No man in my family has lived past the age of twenty. Perhaps it's a family curse. So, I treat every day of my life as my first. Tan Jiamu. You're here. I'm here for your brother. Are you stupid? Treat every day as your first? So you have to come out of your mother's… every day? You're from the reading society? What is it? I heard you've dated a lot of girls from my school. - Yeah… - I want to ask you something today. - Why haven't you dated me? - What? Your nails are too ugly. Can you take me there? From the back door, he saw the old man was set free and Zhao Hu holding down the Taoist priest. He could not help his fury and raised his blade, charging at Zhang Long. Master Zhang was unarmed but his feet were clever, ducking flexibly to evade the blade while throwing a palm strike. Fear only hidden weapons from villains. You can't hit me. Suddenly turning his body, Zhang unleashes a leg sweep. You evil priest. Let's take a break, have a drink of water. - Thank you. - Thank you. Watch out! Smoke. Jing Jing! Be careful! - Jing Jing! - Go! Hurry! Be careful! Hurry! Go! Go! What are you doing? Stop it, all of you! Where's Shibata? Get him out here. This has nothing to do with you. Leave. Stop talking rubbish. There's only two of them. Attack! It's not what you think. It's just a misunderstanding. What misunderstanding? I don't care why you came to stir up trouble. Go and tell Shibata. From now on, Jing Hao is part of the reading society. Hey! Sorry. How is it? Does it still hurt? No problem. No problem at all. No matter what, we were lucky to have you today. If there's nothing else, you should try to get some rest. I'm leaving now. - Teacher, I'll walk you out. - Okay. Bye bye. Allow your brother to— Go away. Teacher. Teacher, take your time. - Come again! - Come again! Nice work. A'Pi, get me some water. Did you see a fortune teller today? How did you know to bring people over? I glimpsed at the stars tonight and noticed the Big Dipper shifting south and Sirius glowing blue. I calculated with my fingers… Shock! Can you… speak…properly? Peacock notified me. You... also...? I… Hum… Look, the moon is so round. So round… What are you looking at? From now on, you're only allowed to look at me. Aiya! God! Peacock! I heard you were in a fight! Did you get hurt? Say hi to Boss. Boss. This is… my girlfriend. Miss Liu. Good evening. Please get in the car. This is a special police prison. Every single person here hates me. I hate them too. Making others suffer also makes me suffer. What is the point of all this? Matsui. What are you doing here? I heard Miss Liu used to study medicine. So I invited Miss Liu here to see if she can do anything to save these patients. Daddy, can you read a book to me? Sure. Good deeds bring fortune, bad deeds bring misfortune. Good deeds bring fortune, bad deeds bring misfortune. The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere really needs a promising scholar like Mr. Liu. We want to invite you to manage Manchukuo's education. We'd like to provide an excellent education for Manchukuo's young fellows. Mr. Liu, you have children of your own. I trust you also understand. Thank you all for your care. I've been a burden for everyone. Actually, you don't have to call me teacher anymore. I've already resigned from the school. So what do you plan to do now? Did your father force you? Then do you hate your father? So you already know. In the beginning there definitely was hate. Before, every time I went to a new school, word would get around very quickly that I'm the daughter of a traitor. I actually established the reading society out of rebellion. Out of hate towards him. I told myself I had to cut ties with him. But later on, I also understood why he did what he did. It was actually all to protect me. It's quite interesting to talk about it now. When I truly started forgetting my hate for my father was when I saw clearly the reading society's true meaning and value. It made me see their hope of identifying as Chinese people and winning the war. Then will you continue on with it? Of course. Actually, the reading society has helped me realize, that in in the face of a national crisis no one can avoid being involved. I'll help you. Shibata won't let things go so easily. I'll protect you and the reading society. The fish is burnt. I apologize for the offense Muto caused you the other day. I'm sorry. This is compensation. It should make up for what happened before. I hope the reading society won't affect our friendship. Do you know what this means? Black water and white mountains. Occupied by cruel Japanese invaders. Our innocent Chinese men were tormented. The mountains and rivers were stained with blood and corpses everywhere. Poverty and eviction. Thinking of our unrecovered hometown. Burst into tears. Fight or freedom. Vow to fight. Dead bodies buried in horse leather. Fight on the battlefield and impress our military prestige. Encourage ambitious in ice and snow. Strengthened courage in frost and rain. Await for the triumphant day of recovery in Northeast China and comfort. I heard you have run into some difficulties. Please give me some more time. Please... have faith in me. I don't doubt you at all. Rather, I admire you a great deal. You are also needed for our next move. Please do not refuse our assistance. [Ukon Onizuka, 7th black belt in Karate] - You made it? - Yes. [Kagetora Izaki, Yokozuna level in Sumo] [Kenzaburo Tokuhira, 5th black belt in Judo] Don't go overboard! Drink! Drink! Drink! What is it, Boss? You did this, didn't you? We were obeying Chief Matsui's orders. Two of my men were beaten up. Who's going to take responsibility? You still have us, don't you? Boss. Take off your helmet. Pick up your wooden sword. If this was a real sword you'd be dead already. You died again. I know you want to take charge of the family like a man, but you are not ready yet. I'm ready. I'm the heir to the Shibata family. You're my little brother. No wonder why that boy fights so hard for you. You're so pretty. Why don't you do what women are supposed to do? Ants struggling before the iron heel are destined to fail. When the Black Ships demanded to open up Japan, did the ants not struggle before the iron heel? So Miss Liu knows about the Black Ships too. When I was born, all my family had left was a dilapidated dojo, and my father who was obsessed to redeem our family name. To fulfill my father's wish, I brought my brother to Manchukuo. This war is an opportunity for us. Do you really believe you will win this war? I don't know who will ultimately win this war, or if a warrior family like mine can ever see the light of its former glory. But… for each of us, isn't living for who we love the most important thing? If we abandon our faith just for the sake of staying alive, then we don't deserve love. You should stop this now, or else the people we love will all get hurt. I'm planning to halt reading society activities. What? You don't need to be afraid of Shibata. I'll go all out if they dare come back again. But I don't want you to do that. Someone asked me why I started the reading society. The reason I started it was to remind every young person that we are Chinese. One person may not be able to change history, but history is still ultimately written by man. And each Chinese person who doesn't forget who they are will all become the sparks of a future wildfire. I am thus stopping the reading society now so we can preserve all of these sparks. Do I count as a spark? Of course. Do you think Boss is telling her that he has an incurable disease? Nonsense! Come on. I'm coming! A'Pi! Stop it! Tan Jiamu. For your sweat. Thanks. Mr. Matsui. How's the food? Yes, It's delicious. It's the taste of my home. I wish I can see the cherry blossoms in Ueno next year. What are you doing here? We're just passing by. Get out if you're not buying anything. I'm buying. You don't have a reason to kick customers out. What are you buying? That. You're much better looking than your brother. What are you doing? What are you doing?! Tan Jiamu! Tan Jiamu! - Don't move! - Let go! Let go of him! Tan Jiamu! Thanks for the food. - This is your change. - No. No need. You can keep it. I'll be back. Thank you for your patronage. Farewell. Chief Liu, didn't you say your daughter's in Shanghai? Miss Liu. Your student killed a citizen of the Empire of Japan. Can you come to assist in our investigation? Chief Liu, you don't need to go any further. I'll take care of Miss Liu. No matter what happens next, drive away immediately. Don't worry. They won't dare touch me. Go. - Father. - Hurry go! Hurry go! What do you mean by this? Let's leave this place. Okay. Let's go. I'm going to the toilet. [Best known] Why did you do it? In my view, all our problems have been resolved. There's an old Chinese saying I really like: "The victory of a general is built upon the sacrifice of tens of thousands." I am the Shibata family's only heir. [A'Pi] [A'Pi] [Tian Jia Mu] I am the Shibata family's… Jing Hao. I admire you. So I will let all your brothers mourn for you today. This is going to be your burial ground. Today we are not just recognizing soldiers in battle, but also a special citizen of the Empire of Japan. He is not a soldier, but his heroic efforts are worthy of a medal of honor. [Wanted] My condolences. "The victory of a general is built upon" "the sacrifice of tens of thousands." [Tian Jia Mu] I'm no longer Jing Hao of Qing He. I'm just a fugitive on the run. [A'Pi] [Tian Jian Mu] Don't you want to live? That's right. We don't want to live. Isn't that right?
