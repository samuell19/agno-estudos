You're not Miss Babe. Uh, Babe's been taken ill. I'm replacing her to do Mrs. Stilton's nails. OK? All right, I guess so. Hey. Come here, Kiss. Come here. Get out of here. Come here, come here, Peaches. Mrs. Stilton's upstairs in her room. Oh, excuse me. Yeah? I have to look in your case. What for? Mr. Stilton says I'm supposed to. Thank you. OK. Can I go up now? How long will you be? Not long. Will you need me to let you out? No. I can do that by myself. OK. Just be sure and close the big gates behind you. Mrs. Stilton? Yes. Come in. Close the door. What took so long? I thought you were coming an hour ago. You're not Babe. Babe's sick, Mrs. Stilton. Sick? Yes. She asked me to pinch-hit. Pinch-hit? Do your manicure. Well, I was expecting Babe. She should have said something. You can set up over there. So did, uh... Babe tell you to bring something for me? What's your name? Blondie. Blondie? Yeah, Blondie. Didn't you ever read the funnies? You're not a blonde, are you? So what? You asked me my name, and I told you. Blond-ie. Just asking. Your husband's not home yet, huh? No. So, did Babe give you something to bring to me? That's her stuff, right? It's usually under the tray. I know she was bringing me something. Yeah, I got something for you. Wh-wh-what? Here! Here! Keep your rings on. This ain't a robbery. OK, OK, OK. Take a couple of deep breaths. Breathe! Try and get over the shock of this... so we can get down to business and cooperate with each other. Now, where's your husband? Gone. Gone? Where? When's he coming back? Answer me! Where's he at and when's he coming home, lady? Hey! Hey, you want your stuff? You're not going to go yellow pants on me, are you? Works fast, huh? See you Friday.

Nice. Hey, you got two bucks I could borrow? Two dollars? Yeah. Pay you back Friday. Thanks, sis. It's--It's for Johnny. A surprise for my Johnny. Listen to this shit. "There was a lull today in organization activities... "a brief pause before the actual battle... "for control of the city begins. "At dawn tomorrow, the final battle will begin.” That's what them faggots... on the "Kansas City Journal Post” got to say. Seldom Seen is telling you... that what's going to happen at dawn tomorrow... going to depend on what happen when the sun go down tonight. You can believe that shit. We will elect every Democrat on the ticket without exception! So get out every vote for the Democratic candidates! Vote early... in an orderly manner. You can't sit there. That's for white people. I can't? Not unless you want to get killed. You coming in or going out? In. Who's supposed to meet you? I don't know. Some white ladies. White ladies. What for? I been sent here to have a baby.

Put it away--the money. What are you doing out here? Ain't you supposed to be working? I am working. Get back to it, then. Wait for me, boys! Charming little fella, your husband. Thanks, Sis. That's Stilton! That's Stilton! Come on, get a picture of him. Mr. Stilton, Jim Wilson, "Kansas City Star.” Is it true that you and your wife are going to be... permanently relocating to Washington, D.C.? I'm not relocating anywhere. Rumor mill has it, sir-- Never listen to rumors, young man. Be responsible. Rumor mill has it that since you've been... working so closely with the President... you're considering leaving. Are you denying that? Yes, I am. Right now our own Henry Stilton... is on his way back to Washington to meet with the President. Can ll have an answer to that please, Mr. Stilton? Mr. Stilton! How about a comment... on the current political situation... here in Jackson County? I have nothing at all to say to the press. ...and Kansas City is unanimously Democratic! Washington? What do you mean Washington? Washington, D.C.7? What the hell's he doing there? He travels there a lot. That's where he works. He's an adviser to President Roosevelt. Are you lying to me? No, I'm not lying. It's what he does. I know what he does. Don't you think I know what he does? Can ll lie down now?? Yeah. You're going to tell me... where he stays when he's there, all that. Don't stall around with me. I'm in a desperate situation here. I'm not sure what I'm going to do. So don't mess with me 'cause I'm running out of time. I'd just as soon shoot you... and those two Kraut dogs down there along with it. Now spit it out. What time is Sheepshan's train coming in? Should be here by now. Who'd you send to pick up Sheepshan Red? Blue Green. He's been waiting around for the call all morning. Blue Green? Yes. He's the worst driver in the place. What are you waiting for? A tip? Sheepshan squeeze a dollar till the eagle shit. He ain't giving up nothing. Call me when he come in. OK. How're the dice, brother? Forty on five. Hey, boys, get on that truck! Let's go! Load 'em up!

Sir! Sir! Sir! We got a cab waiting for you right here. I'm going to the Street's Hotel. Yes, sir. You're Sheepshan Red, ain't you? That's what they call me. What train's he on? The Grand Canyon Limited to Chicago... then the Capitol Limited to Washington. So right now he's on a train to Chicago... not Washington, right? You're some liar, lady. I'm not lying. To get to Washington... he's got to go through Chicago and change trains. All right. What time does he get in Chicago? 3:00. 3:50... Ten of 3:00. I don't know. Thanks. You know, my husband will pay the money. You don't have to worry about that. What money? This isn't about money. I don't want your money. Then what is it about? What this is about is Johnny O'Hara. I just want to get him back, safe. If Henry doesn't help me, I'm going to kill you. I got nothing against you. Anyhow, that's my plan. Think he'll go for it? Who's Johnny O'Hara? Give me the money! What? What? Come on! Just do what he says, mister, So no one gets hurt. Come on, yellow pants. I know you're wearing it. Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Did you see his face? Who is that? Goddamn it! Take me to the Hey-Hey Club. Yes, sir. Seldom's going to hear about this shit! Yes, sir. That's Lester Young... over there. Here we are, sir. Your hat. Come on, driver. You're coming with me. I have another call. Another call, my ass! I'm your next call! You are my witness, and you're coming with me. I'm trying to tell you... somebody took all my goddamn money! Stuck a gun in my face... and took my money belt right off my waist! But you just came in on the train. I came in on a cab from the train, Seldom. Seldom, your coat. - What? - Your coat. I don't want no goddamn coat. Somebody set me up, Seldom! Some nigger was waiting on me. You know goddamn well... I ain't gonna stand for this shit. What are you telling me? Some nigger robbed me in your cab! Stuck a gun in my face and took all my damn money! That's what I'm talking about! In my cab? In your fucking cab, Seldom. Blue Green! Blue! Where's Blue? That nigger knew what he was doing. He was waiting for me. Come here, Blue. What the hell are you hiding back there for? Come out here, boy. What happened here? I don't know nothing about it. Some man hopped in the cab and started waving his gun around. Colored man? Yes, Seldom. You recognize him? No, Seldom. Sheepshan, this don't make no sense. Nobody around here would pull that kind of shit. Nobody around here that dumb. We'll take care of you. We'll find out. We'll get-- Goddamn, what's this shit? What the hell is that? It's on you. What does it look like? Smell like lampblack, smell it. I don't know nothing about that. You were there! What the hell you mean... you don't know nothing about it? I don't know nothing about it. Don't know nothing about what, Blue? Don't know nothing about nothing, Seldom. Smells like burnt cork. Smell that. What that smell like? You holding out on me, boy? Jesus Christ... you've been held up by Amos 'n' Andy. Can you believe that shit? Amos 'n' Andy. Right, Amos? Right? I don't know nothing about it. Tell me about this, boy! What happened? Whose idea was it? Don't fuck with me! Whose idea was it? So long, Amos. Come on, man! Come on, man! Let's go! Get your coat! OK, I'm coming. Hurry up, boy. Johnny? Hey. Hurry up. Get your clothes on. I am hurrying. We're going to take a powder. A what? We're going out for a while. Oh, uh, we are? Uh, what should I wear? Whatever you wear when you go out to shop or something. Nothing fancy. Yeah, don't try to high-hat me. I got your number, sister. What's that stuff you take? Nerve medicine. Laudanum. Yeah? What's it do? It relaxes me. It's a tonic for my nerves. No kidding. Maybe I ought to try some. Think it will help my nerves? Jackass! Do you want some? Babe says it's dope. She says you're a dopehead. Babe is a regular magpie, isn't she? Who's Johnny? 'Cause you haven't told me anything really. You don't listen very well, lady. I listen well enough. Babe your sister? Where was Babe tonight? Did she know about this? Why don't you shut up? He didn't mean any harm, though. He's just thinking of me... just dreaming. Why don't you have a drink, doll? No, thank you. Come on. Good American brandy. Have a drink. All right. Thank you. Mister, my husband did a dumb thing. You got your money back, right? Right? I got the money. All of it. Sucker didn't even buy himself a pack of cigarettes. Good. So, uh, can I have my husband back now? How would you like him? In a sack or in a box? Son of a bitch, don't you touch him! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Now what are they doing to her? Let me go! Stop it! Stop! Stop it! Stop! Out. Where are we going? Out. Don't make me say it a third time. On a train? Out of town? Shut up. All right. Easy. Can you walk? Of course I can walk. Then do it. I'm holding on to you. No, I'm holding you. Just walk like a lady, for Christ's sake. Don't do anything funny, understand? Funny word, isn't it? It's funny. Just 'cause we're in a public place... doesn't mean I won't use this gun if I have to. No, that wouldn't be funny, would it? Stop all that funny business. Carry your own weight. I'm not so big. Oh, hey, Addie. Hi, Miss Blondie. We're just going to go into Mr. Hoyt's office for a while. That OK with you? I haven't finished in there yet. Park the body, sister. Take your coat off. We're going to be here awhile. You're very bold, aren't you? Just do like I said. Union Station. May I help you? Yeah, I need to know... if someone's on the Grand Canyon Limited to Chicago... that left Kansas City today at--What time? Red? 4:00. 4:15? 4:15. Where the train is now... and if I tell him to get off the train at the next stop... where would that be? Is this an emergency, ma'am? Yeah, it sure is. The train is due into Fort Madison, Iowa, at 9:30. So soonest I could talk to him would be 9:30? That's when the train stops. All right, thanks. All right, you stay glued to that seat. And don't get silly 'cause I've got someone... right outside that door who'll bop you. Is that clear? Yes, it's very clear. Need your help here, Addie. This lady, she's run off from her husband. He's been beating her up and whatnot... and I'm trying to help her... but ll got to go send a telegram right now... so I need you to watch her. Watch her? Yeah, keep an eye peeled. I don't want her going anyplace. Think you're a smart Jane, don't you? I don't know about all this, Miss Blondie. I'll give you the straight goods. She's on dope. You know what that means. Yes, ma'am, I do. Ah, she's bumping into walls... and talking the screwiest stories. If she tries to go someplace, just tell her she can't. Wouldn't want her to hurt herself, now, would we? No, ma'am. What's your name for him? Who? What do you call him? Henry, Hank, what? Mr. Stilton? I--1 don't know. I call him that. When you're alone, nitwit. What do you call him in private? Your pet name for him. Private? Uh, ll don't know what you mean. In bed, when you're doing it. You do do it, don't you? Heinie. Sometimes I call him Heinie. What's he call you? What name do you use with him? What's he call you? Me? - Yeah, you. In private. Pussy. Pussy? Pussy and Heinie. What a terrible invasion of privacy. Yeah, ain't it? How's your son doing? Charles? Oh, Charles is fine, Miss Blondie. He's good. He plays in the high-school marching band. Yeah? Good for you. Look. That's Lester Young right there on the saxophone. See that man there? Uh-huh. That's Seldom Seen. Seldom Seen? What kind of name is that? He won't tell nobody what his real name is. He's a gambler... and he goes around to all kinds of different places. Might not see him for a long time. He's been to prison three times for murder. He's a big talker, though-- Seldom Seen but often heard. Oh, hi, Blondie. Oh, hey, Lucy. Hey, Alice, you can take your break now. I didn't know it was your shift, Blondie. Yeah, old battle-ax changed my hours again. Your hair's growing out good, huh? Yeah. Every day. You're not Rose. No, ma'am. I'm Addie Parker. Where's Rose? You mean Miss Blondie, ma'am? Yes. Yes, I mean Blondie. Where is Blondie? She's in the operating room, ma'am. Operating room? Yes, ma'am. Uh, so is-- Is this the hospital? No. It's the Western Union where you send the wires. Wires? Telegrams. My husband. Yes. We're going to contact my husband. Oh, I don't know anything about all that, ma'am. Well, I--1 don't think she would like it... if she thought we were being too talkative. My husband is doing all the talking... but he is no longer part... of the local political establishment, per se. He hasn't been since 1932... when President Roosevelt appointed him adviser. And regardless of the outcome of the local election... my husband will stay in Washington. Yes, ma'am. As to the situation here... I don't know if he really cares... whether the Goats are good or the Rabbits are wrong. I mean, he's sympathetic to the Rabbits... but that has nothing to do with my situation here tonight. Our situation, I should say. Which do you prefer? Well, I think you're a mighty pretty lady, ma'am... and either one of these hats will do you just fine. Goats or Rabbits. Oh, I don't know much about Goats and Rabbits, ma"am. Oh, you don't? No, ma'am. Miss. Oh, hi. Can you help me? I need to send a telegram. I'm in a hurry... but I've got to reach this girl's mother tonight. This one is for-- Well, Blondie, hello. What happened to your hair? It broke off. Too much peroxide. OK. It's pretty. It's different. OK. Shoot. All right. This one is for Mrs. Pearl Cummings. I'm sorry. Pearl is the daughter. That's for Mrs. Cummings. And that's very important. That's got to go right away. And then this is for Governor Park. And then we have President Roosevelt. We've got an emergency here... and we're asking them to call out the National Guard for us. I thought we could talk this over like gentlemen. Take your coat off. All here? It's all there, Seldom. Sit down. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! Come on! Goddamn it! Shit! Merry Christmas, Sheepshan. Nice to see old friends. Thank you. What's going on here? Nothing, Miss Blondie. Come on. We're through here. Give me that. I paid five dollars for this hat. My, what a bargain. Come on. Thanks a million, Addie. You're welcome, Miss Blondie. You don't need to crack about any of this. Be better if you didn't. Nobody's going to ask me anything. They never do. I got to say this for you. You got guts. Guts and no brains. Guts alone don't mean nothing. Guts is cheap. Fucking pig got guts. Blue, here, he's sitting up all night long... sucking on some pig guts. Don't even know which you like better... pot of chitlings or a piece of pussy. A pig got more brains than you. You come swinging in here like...like Tarzan... right in the middle of a sea of niggers... like you're in a picture show. You like picture shows? I'm talking to you. You like picture shows? I can take them or leave them. I'd recommend you leave them... after what they done done to your ass... with all that Ham-bone and Stepin Fetchit shit. Or maybe-- Maybe you're a radio man. You...you like radio? Answer me! Yeah, I like it sometimes. Goddamn right you do. All that Amos--Amos 'n' Andy. In the movies and in radio... white people just sit around all day long... thinking up that shit. And then they believe it. Hello, Ruby. Hello, Eddie. Did you miss me? I've been dying for you. Gee, and I thought-- I know what you thought, and I don't blame you. I didn't dare to try to get word to you. All 1 wanted to do was to get away. Soon as I could send for you-- Sure. I know. L1 got some great plans for the two of us... and the kid--our kid. Central operator. Hello, central. I'd like to place a call to Kansas City, Missouri. I made my mind up that today we were going to be married. Gee, those are the breaks. Everything's going to be all right. I'm going to have you... and you're going to have me for always. Gee, it feels good, holding you like this. I love you, Eddie. You still with us? Long distance. Fort Madison, Iowa, train station... and put some snap into it. What do you mean she's gone? What's happening? What's going on? She's just gone with the lady who came to do her nails. Babe? No, sir. It wasn't Miss Babe. You better have yourself... another little swig of that stuff. You're going to get to talk to Heinie in a minute. You better not call him that. He won't like that one bit. 1 did everything I was supposed to do, Mr. Stilton. I'm not in any trouble, am 1? Mr. Stilton? Yes. There's a call for you. It's long distance from Kansas City. It's your wife. All right, Rose, Mrs. Stilton's on another line here. Now you stay awake. Have yourself a cup of coffee... and stay by my phone in case I need you. Yes, sir. Carolyn, what's going on? I'm not Carolyn, Mr. Stilton. Who is this? Easy, tough guy. I'm in charge here, OK? Is this about the emergency? I just tried to call home. Is my wife all right? Is she awake? Yeah. I'm here with your wife. Then let me speak to her, please. In 2 minute you can talk to her. First you're going to listen to me. What is this? Who are you? You got a pencil? Take this down. There's a guy named Johnny O'Hara, OK? He's been picked up by some nigger gangsters. The head guy's named Seldom Seen. You'll find him at the Hey-Hey Club on 18th street. Wait a minute. On 18th street. They're going to knock Johnny off unless you stop it. I figure any guy that can tell... old Bandy Legs where to get off... can get these no-good shines to let my Johnny go. I'm keeping your wife for insurance, get it? If Johnny gets free, you get your wife back. If he doesn't, I'm going to put a bullet through her head. And don't get cute, smart guy. Play games, they're both dead-- Johnny and your wife. You follow me? Yes. Good. OK. Where's the club? Uh...18th street. The Hey-Hey Club. Good. I'm going to put her on the phone now... so you can hear her voice. Then I want you to go to work for Johnny. If anything goes wrong, Mr. Stilton, she's a goner. H-H-Heinie. Carolyn, are you all right? Yes. Yes. I'm OK. I'm calm, uh, as much as I can be. Oh... She's desperate, as you can tell. I'm cooperating. Are you sure you're all right? I'll get through this. That's enough, Pussy. You're eating into his time. No. No. I haven't taken anything. All right, Mr. Stilton. Do what you got to do. Get on the phone to Lazia or Pendergast... or whoever else you know. I figure you're on the next train out of there. I'll phone you at your house when you get back. You better have the right answers by then. Your beautiful wife won't look so great... with her brains splattered all over the sidewalk. Looks like I'm going to have you on my hands for a while. Think you can stand the company? I left my baby Standing in the back door crying Yes, I left my baby Standing in the back door crying Well, she said, "Baby, as long as I got a home" "You know you can come to mine” When I leave you, baby, count the days that I'm gone Got him around here somewheres. He's in one of these rats' nests. You can bet on it. You can count the days that I'm gone You know, I don't really know what you're talking about... so it's hard for me to follow you. Who asked you to? Nobody did. Well, then, shut up. Greed just grabbed your ass... and fucked up your think machine. White people are consumed with greed. Just can't get enough. Never get enough of anything. Even they don't need it, they got to have it... and don't care how they get it. You lie, you cheat, you hustle, you rape. You kill your mothers. You burn your babies. You piss in the soup. This here depression is because y'all can't get enough. Goddamn bus ain't got no driver. Roosevelt up there in Washington... sitting down in his wheelchair... trying to put poor-ass crackers on Home Relief. And Marcus Garvey trying to put niggers... on boats to go back to Africa up there in New York. What the fuck are you going to do in Africa? Huh? You must be in some sad shit... to have to be holding up colored people. What am I going to do with you? I'll think of something. Oh, yeah. Yeah, bet you he's in the basement... or some back room or something. What is that place? I'm not talking to you, half-wit. Well, who are you talking to? Myself. Well, so how am I supposed to know? There are two of us here, you know. I mean, when one person is talking... it's reasonable to assume that the party who is speaking... is speaking to the other party, isn't it? Now listen to me, operator. This is really quite simple. Let's not make a big production out of this. I want the Governor's Mansion in Jefferson City, Missouri. I want to speak to Governor Guy Park... and it's an emergency. Just one call. I'll be right back. Henry, what can I do for you? Guy, I need your help. My wife's been kidnapped. A woman came to the house and took her... when I was on the train. The woman says she wants her husband back. Some of the colored have him. Where are you? Where did this happen, in Kansas City? I should get the state police in on this. No, no, no, no. We can't have any police. I don't want the publicity... you understand? I don't want this story getting back to Washington... where it can cause some real damage. It has to be handled very quietly and quickly. Kansas City. Tomorrow's Election Day. This is a tough call. Everybody's going to be distracted. Well, what about John Lazia? Can you contact him? Yes. He's the one--Lazia. I can't talk to him directly. I have to go through Pendergast, I guess. I don't like asking favors. It will cost me down the line. Look, Guy, I'll make this up to you. President Roosevelt-- I know. I know. You don't have to promise anything. Your wife's in danger. Get her back. That's the important thing. Bess. That's her name, isn't it? Carolyn. Oh, yes, of course. Bess is Truman's wife. Look, Guy, I appreciate this. Thanks. Excuse me. What time does the train... back to Kansas City come through here? What did you think of her? I'm sorry. Are you addressing me? Yeah, I'm addressing you. What did you think of her? Who? Harlow. I thought her hair looked cheap. Cheap! Ha! That's a laugh. Joan Crawford looks cheap, not Jean Harlow. Joan who? Crawford. "Grand Hotel"? Jesus Christ. What do you do all day? Well, I don't frequent movie theaters... unlike some I could mention. I don't know about all that stuff. Let me tell you something. Harlow, Crawford, two of MGM's brightest. Crawford comes from here. Both her and Jean Harlow come from Kansas City. I know where the house is Jean Harlow grew up in. She ain't cheap. Her daddy's a dentist. Dr. Carpenter. Still lives here. Wait. Wait. Which? Dentist? Doctor? Carpenter? Which? Ah, useless! It's like talking to a fish. Well, don't confuse me. Watch your ash. I mean, you asked me what I thought... and I'm telling you. Her hair looked cheap and brassy and common to me. Low-class, I guess, is what I'm trying to say. Are you trying to tell me that hair of yours... don't come out of a bottle... just like your cheeks and your lips and your nails... and anything else you can paint on? Cheap. If Jean Harlow's cheap, then I'm a monkey's uncle. What am I doing, yapping away with some idiot? Sitting here like two hanging ducks. She ain't cheap. I'm not talking to you anymore. Great. Great. Maybe I have the upper hand then. We're out of gas. I concede the merry chase. Maybe you're insane. You have no husband. You are dying, and I'm dying. Will you shut up? I can't think with you talking like a nutcase! OK, toots. Out. No, you can't stop what's already been decided. Something, whatever we discover it to be... has already been decided. We're just going along for the ride... until at the latter day... we reach the house of a thousand candles. Yeah. Northside Democratic Club. John Lazia, please. Tom Pendergast calling. Just a minute. John, Tom Pendergast on the phone for you. Tom Pendergast? A little late for him, isn't it? He goes to bed with the chickens. Mr. Pendergast, John Lazia here. Yeah, John. Sorry to call so late. It's not late. What can I do for you? Listen, John, I got a call from Governor Park. Henry Stilton needs a favor. It seems his wife has gone and got herself kidnapped... and he's somewhere in Iowa. She got kidnapped in Iowa? No, she didn't get kidnapped in Iowa. She got kidnapped right here in Kansas City. This could turn out to be a good thing for us. You ever had to use a gun before? Huh? Have you ever shot a bullet through someone's body... like you talk about? I bet I'd be better at doing that than you would. Give it a rest, will you? Take another swig of that stuff if you have to... but don't talk anymore. I've been annoyed with your kisser long enough. Out of gas, huh? Yeah. A few blocks up. Don't have a gas can, either, huh? Don't have a can. Excuse me, young man. Would there be a rest room around here? Right around the corner. Thank you. You only get two gallons. There's a ten-cent deposit on this can, too, you know. What do you think you're trying to pull? Leave the door open. Tommy guns. You hear that? Coming this way. Don't! Don't! Don't! OK, OK. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. I give up! Let's go. Come on. Hey, you didn't pay for that gas, did you? Here's your drink, sir. I don't want that. I didn't order that. Oh, I beg your pardon. Here's your drink, sir. Thank you very much. Where are we going? Well, we ain't goin' very far on two gallons of gas, are we? I never thought of that. What? Oh, gas...and how long it lasts. Hey, nothing runs on nothing. Whatever you do, you're using something up. Even time. Light me, will you? You know, when you said that stuff... about her being cheap-- Harlow... that was just a part she was playing. She's an actress, you know. I seen that picture six times. And I read in "Photoplay” she's making a new one. It's called "Girl from Missouri.” I can't wait to see that one. I'm from Missouri, too. People say I look like her... when my hair's blond. Weren't we just here? We got to spend the night somewhere. I figure it's pretty safe. No one would figure we'd come back here. All the cops are going to be out... stuffing ballot boxes. Well, what do you mean "safe"? I mean, you know, people get killed here. Didn't you read about The Union Station Massacre? It just happened last year. I was working here, wasn't 1?7 Really? Do you know that Frank Nash's toupee... got blown right off his head? No more bets. All right. You have to understand Sheepshan. He's a loser. Losers have got to be respected. They're the backbone of my business. They're my customers... and I take good care of my customers. Spent all year waiting to come to this crap game... up there in Minnesota... putting these big wooden dicks into holes all over the ground-- telephone poles-- just to be in this game. He's the only colored man I know... got a contract with the phone company, ain't he? That's right. Son, nigger's supposed to be respected. May I ask you something? I'm not through talking. Sheepshan's an evil son of a bitch. If he loses, he'll see bad luck written all over you... and he's going to want to cut you up. And if he wins, I'm coming for you. Then you're going to wish he done the cutting. Either way, you're going to hook up with Blue here... wherever you're going. You and him can work oh your Amos 'n' Andy routine. Yes, sir. If somebody doped Trixie... they would have had to climb up the ladder... through the window, and what would happen? He would have barked. It was somebody inside the Lindbergh house. So you subscribe to the theory that Violet Sharpe was involved? Listen, nobody socks down cyanide unless they're guilty. I'll tell you something. If this is the case, then those Lindberghs... should have gotten themselves a colored maid... and this might never have happened. Those Lindberghs were too snooty. They had to get English help. - Scottish. Scottish. - Whatever. Sure are a beautiful couple. Gosh, that baby was cute. Perfect. Beautiful couple, beautiful baby. He was only three years old. He weren't three. Weren't even two. He was eighteen months old when they found him. I cried every time I saw his picture in the paper. You got kids? No. Me, either. I got it. Whoa!t Help us now! Pockets. Seldom! You got too many goddamn pockets... somebody gonna want to pick them. That's why I got a box. I'm sorry, Seldom! Only one man ever been in my box--Marcus Garvey. Garvey said to me... he said, "Seldom, I want to buy me some boats... "and I want to take all the black people... "in America back to Africa. "1 want you to invest in my Black Star Line... "make you a lot of money."” Did I ever tell you the story about Marcus Garvey... the Jew, and the white man? No. They were shipwrecked on this island... and one day they was walking along the beach... and they find themselves this whiskey bottle. They start to brush the sand off the bottle... and out come this genie, and the genie says... "I've been here for 4,000 years... "and I want to thank y'all for letting me out. "Anything you want. One wish.” So they turn to Garvey, and Garvey said... "Well, I would like all the black people in the world... "to go back to Africa and live forever.” Then he turned to the Jew... and he said to him, "What do you want?" And the Jew says, "Well, I'd like to have... "all the Jews in the world "go back to the Holy Land and live forever.” Then he turned to the cracker... and he said to him, "What you want?" The cracker said, "Wait a minute. "You mean you got... "all the niggers in the world in Africa... "and you got all the kikes in the world... in the Holy Land?" The genie said, "Yeah."” He said, "Well, then, shit. "Give me a martini.” Anybody want some pork? Goddamn. Come on, boys. Let's hear some music. Bye, Blue. Come on. We got to get home before my mother does... or she's going to go to prison for murdering me. Am ll going with you? Where else you going to go? Come on. All right. Wake up. Wake up. Now, what-- What are you doing here? It's me--Blondie. Yeah. I know you. Yeah. Come on. We got to get. Is my husband here? No, but he's coming. He's going to be here any minute... so we got to get out of sight. Wouldn't want him to think we came down... to meet him, would we? We wouldn't? No, we wouldn't. Oh! Dreams. You snore in your sleep. You ladies certainly had to get here early this morning... to be first in line. Yes, we did. But you know, the early bird gets the worm. That's what I've always said. I hear that. So you think your vote's... going to make a difference then, I take it. Well, of course, it will. We're here early to cast our vote... before Mr. Pendergast this morning. Mr. Pendergast! Not today, fellas. I'm just here to vote. Well, here we go. Thank you. Is it true that you're backing Harry Truman... One question. I'm sorry. Just take them up. I'm here--l mean, Stilton residence. Thank you. Rose, this is Mr. Stilton. Let me speak with Mrs. Stilton. She ain't back yet, Mr. Stilton. Rose. Rose. Stop crying, Rose. It's not your fault. Just stay there. I'll be home soon. You ever meet Babe's old man? No. That's his bar. All right, boys, listen up! Voting time. I want you in two single lines. Right now. Come on. Line up. Line up. Put the drinks down and line up. He's got a lot of customers. Those aren't customers. Those are voters. They ship them in from all over the state. Each one of them vote ten, twelve times. They used to get their names out of the cemetery. I don't even think they bother anymore. You'll be exercising your God-given right to vote. However, you'll be voting the way I tell you to vote... and as many times as I tell you. Is that understood? Yeah. Understood? Shut up! Democrats do that? Democrats? They're whatever they're paid to be. This is America, lady. Right face! Come on. Is that the best you can do? Left face! You boys are a bunch of sorry asses... but I'll get you in shape. I don't want to do this shit anymore. I want a drink. Go home. Duck. That's him. Duck. You understand now? What are you looking at? Get this car out of here! Blondie, is that you? What the hell are you doing? Who's this with you? That? That's my friend Red. She's visiting me from Joplin. Hey, where's Babe? She here? That boyfriend of yours is in big trouble. He's not my boyfriend. Word's out. He's my husband! What did you hear? He's in big trouble's what I hear. Son of a bitch got what he deserved... and don't go dragging Babe into it. Babe's already in it up to here. Goddamn you, Blondie. We're coming in, Flynn. We'll just camp out upstairs till the polls open. We won't bother nobody. Out. You better not. I'm getting fed up with your crap. Go bust a few more noses. All right, shut up! Go ahead. Line up on the right. Let's go. Get out the door now! Go! Move it! Hey, you, what are you, special? Go! Hey, Flynn. - Flynn! - What? Give me a couple of corned beefs on rye and two beers. A Coca-cola. Yeah, and a Coca-cola. I look like your nigger? Tell the waitress. I'm calling Babe. If you think you're fooling me... with your friend from Joplin stuff... I know what's what. Eh! You got all the answers, don't you? 1 used to work here. You drive a cab, boy? Good. We got an opening. I just lost one of my drivers. Hi, Glenn Dora. My mama home yet? Lucky for you she's not. Bringing young girls into her house. Hiya, Sis. What the hell is wrong with you? Maybe you'll get your nails done after all. Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind? You're going to bring it down on all of us... and I'm the goat here. I'm the one who's going to get it. Mrs. Stilton, I'm sorry about this. If you just get your things together... I'm going to take you home now. But we just got here. What are you trying to do, be a hero? I don't believe this. I don't believe it. Believe it. You've got a gun? You're pointing a gun at me? At your own sister? Oh, shut up and sit down. It's not about you. It's about Johnny-- my Johnny. That's all it's about. Mrs. Stilton, I'm real sorry about this. I didn't know this was going to happen. I didn't know my sister was crazy. What the hell is wrong with you? Why didn't you just tell me what you were doing? If 1 did, what would you have done-- called Pendergast or Lazia? You think they'd go work for me? Why didn't you come to Johnny? My Johnny? What's he going to do? He's got connections. So's she. You told me you were going to have her make a phone call. I didn't have much choice, did 1?7 Seldom Seen and those niggers mean business. They're going to kill my husband. We don't use that word in our household. We say colored. Jesus Christ. Blondie, you are plain nuts. You kidnapped her. I want my husband back. That's all I'm thinking about. And you've ruined me. You might even have ruined my Johnny. He's got nothing to do with your Johnny... robbing some niggers. Excuse me, Mrs. Stilton. What do you know about it? They came after me, Blondie. They thought I did it... or at least they think I was in on it with you. So? She'll tell them you had nothing to do with it. Won't you, lady? What I find fascinating is that both you ladies... are married to men named Johnny. Oh, Jesus Christ, Blondie. You've gone too far. You got me mixed up in this. You got my husband mixed up. Your Johnny knew what would happen. He knew what would happen if he got caught... and, Blondie, they're not going to let him go! Yeah! No! Not like you think. You got to give this up... and you got to let her go, too... because they're going to kill you! I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry. You shot that gun! You shot that gun! Get up, lady. We're getting out of here. You son of a gun. Thanks for the help, Sis. Thanks a fucking lot. Pull in right here, Jim. Where'd they get these guys? All right, boys. Fall in. Line up. Johnny? All right. All right. All right. Don't forget to vote Democrat, gentlemen. Let's go. Be a good Democrat today. They stink. Stink. What's going on here? You just step back. I'll take care of this. You guys get out of this line... that don't live in this precinct. We're not going to have any of this going on. Nobody votes at this poll that don't live here. 1 got a big problem. These guys don't live in my precinct. They're not going to vote here. They're gonna get out of here. No, no, no. Wait. Wait. Just shut up! Let's go! Get back in line. Feels like I'm getting a cold. All this running around. You'd better be careful. You'll be next. A cold's the least of my worries. Got to find a phone. Got to talk to Heinie. Heinie's in Washington. He's with President Roosevelt. You got a short memory, don't you? Oh, that's right. We talked to him, didn't we? Yeah. Dig deep in there, Einstein... and give me your home number. My--Oh, ah... Yeah, it's 4-7--No. It's-- Never mind! I'll call the operator. All right! There's some gentlemen here to see you-- Shut the door, Rose. Who are you, and what are you doing in my house? I'm Charlie Gargotta. Hi, Mr. Stilton. I'm Jackie Ciro. Yes, I know who you are. My God, man. You can't come to my house in broad daylight. You think people don't watch what ll do? You've no business being here. Get dressed, Rose. Anything we have to talk about... we can talk about on the phone. Did anyone see you come here? John Lazia sent us, Mr. Stilton. We're here to help you get your wife back. Northside Democratic. John Lazia, please. I'm calling for Henry Stilton. John. Hello. This is John Lazia. John, this is Henry Stilton. My God, man. Why would you send these people to my house, for Christ's sake? This was Pendergast's call. Can't this be handled on the telephone? Pendergast asked me to help out with it. I don't think you understand... the consequences of this kind of thing. T-0-n. On Fifty-sixth. Henry. Mrs. Parker. Addie. Fine turnout. I'm sorry. That line is busy. Hey, Addie. Oh, hi, Miss Blondie. What are you doing out here? Voting. I just got through voting. There's a lot of folks... down at the Western Union been looking for you. Yeah, I bet there was. What did you tell them? Nothing because nobody didn't ask me nothing... but they were asking everybody else. About what? About where you was and about that Mrs. Stilton. You live around here? Yes, ma'am. Over on Olive Street. You got a telephone? Yes, ma'am. I sure do. Come on, Addie, I'm going to give you a ride home. I don't want to be no bother. It's not far, and I can walk. It's no bother. Besides, I'd like to use your phone if I could. Anyhow, get in. Thank you. Kind of tight in here. You know why Blue's gone and you're still here? Because I want you here. I'm not sure I got everything... out of your ass I'm going to get. I know how you-all do business. I know everything there is to know about you ofays. Your woman come running in here screaming... "Can I have my husband back?” "You got your money!” Sheepshan got the money. That put a smile on his face. That is, unless he loses. What about me? Who's going to take care of my business... my reputation, my name? Pearl, come here. Hey, how long you live here, Addie? Nice neighborhood. Hey, that's the lady from the club, ain't it? Which lady? That one. The one that was kicking and screaming. They had to take her out. You sure? Well, I think so. You better keep it to yourself. One of Lazia's men was on his way... to the Hey-Hey Club last night, but he never made it. He got in a shoot-out with Sheriff Bash. I know about that. I saw it. You saw it? Never mind. Keep going. That's what happened. A terrible coincidence. So now some other fellas are getting your husband back... so it shouldn't take long. Johnny's OK? Yes, he's fine. Because if he's not OK and you know it... you're wasting your time. Don't you tell nobody about what happened here. Can I have some money? What for? School. Everything all right? You don't look so good. You did the right thing bringing her here, Charles. Now, you be on your way. Addie. Yeah? Do you think we could rest here for an hour or two? We didn't get much sleep last night. Well, it just seem like nobody did. If my mother was alive, she'd cut your balls off. Woman went right to the point. She never, ever missed a beat, but, of course... maybe you haven't been treated as badly as she was treated... for so long. Tell me. You ever been treated bad at all in your whole life ever? Then how would you know what it's like to feel good? Right now you should be feeling good, and you don't. Listen to that music. That's Bill Basie. He's part of the reason you ain't dead yet. You know they give the death penalty... now for kidnapping? Jesus Christ. What are you trying to do, give me nightmares? My husband would never put me in the position... your husband put you in. Shut up. Everybody makes mistakes. You'd do the same thing for Heinie. Ain't that right? No, I don't think so. You don't know nothing about love. What do you mean? Yeah, love. Real love. The kind that makes somebody else a part of you... a part of your body. It's like he's part of my insides. You know what I'm talking about. Right? Get me? I think we should try and sleep now. If it's real love, then you're both the same person... so nothing one can do could ever hurt the other person... 'cause...it's yourself. Good night. Like breathing. I lost my train of thought. I ain't scared of death. I deal with his ass every day. He come knocking at my door, asking me about people... 'cause he knows I know everything... there is to know about what's going on. He's a cold cocksucker. One of these days... one of those knocks are going to be for me... but so what? Sooner or later, everybody got to go. Some sooner than others, and who's to say when that is? In your case... 1 do. Listen to that music. Hey! Mrs. Stilton? Mrs. Stilton? Mrs. Stilton? Nobody in here. Excuse me. I was looking for my friend. Hello. Yeah, hello. I was just dreaming about you. Me? Yeah. You was at the club where they play the music. I was, huh? Black dress with a white collar. And one of our guests was the painter Thomas Hart Benton. You'll have heard of him. And he saw Lois, and she was part Cherokee... and he wanted to paint her, and she refused. Tom wanted her to pose... You had a dream about me? Yeah. You was up on stage dancing... and Charlie was playing the piano. Where's your friend, the other lady? You know me? I saw you at the club yesterday. Maybe you dreamed that, too. No, ma'am. I saw you there big as day. You was kicking and screaming, and those men threw you out. What did they do that for? How old are you? Fourteen. You live here? No, ma'am. I'm from Joplin. Me, too. Come to K.C. to have your baby? Yeah. I did the same thing once. Cigarette? I never smoked before, but I'll try one. Tell me, are you familiar with the works... of Annie Fel'lows Johnston? Yeah. Yes? Well, well, the South that I saw... is not at all as she depicts it in her novels. No. In the South that ll saw... the Negroes are treated like dirt. Kansas City bears no resemblance. You own your home, big enough for your whole family... and your children don't have to work. We're leaving, Missis. Somebody's coming to pick up Pearl. Oh, that's OK. I'll drop her. I know where she's going. Hey! And...they sleep with the hogs. You can imagine my disappointment. Well, I'm sure we'll talk again. All right. I'll see you at work. Yeah, see you at work. Call me, Pearl. So get out today before the polls close... and cast your vote for the future... and the future of your children. Vote Democrat. You ever been away from home before? Mm-mmm. You're going to do fine. Try and get a bed by the window... and don't let them hog the bath on you. OK. I don't know what your story is, but you'll do all right. I was bad off when I came here. You're fourteen, right? Yes. Yeah. See, I was seventeen. Thought I'd never see Johnny again. And ll didn't see him whole time I was there. Then later, we got married. I was at the Crittendon Home. That's the home for white girls. Other than that, they're pretty much the same. It's not bad. Everyone's in the same way as you are. They're all having babies. What did you have, a boy or a girl? What difference does it make? A baby's a baby. You can do whatever you want. 1 didn't keep her. Did you want to keep her? I wanted whatever Johnny wanted. Let's go on up. Ladies and gentlemen, the Easy Eights. Anne, aren't you supposed to be on kitchen duty? Yes, ma'am. Well, you'd better hop to it, girl. This is the nursery in here. It's between the girls' bedrooms... and I'll introduce you to the girls... who you'll be sharing a room with. New roommate, girls. This is Pearl. Introduce yourselves, girls. Hi, Pearl. The bed in the middle is yours. Miss? Hey, kid. Good luck. So long. Sheepshan, my man, how you doing? Last time I looked in, you had them by the short ones. I just can't get that out of my head... getting robbed by that white boy. Shit like that just keeps coming back at you... changing a man's luck. You know, Seldom, as long as you've known me... losing money has never bothered me much. As long as you've known me... you can say that's a fair statement, can't you? I think that's a very fair statement, Sheepshan. You got a reputation. You're a good loser. Last time, you said some other goon was getting him back. You said it wouldn't be long. That was almost ten hours ago. Something's wrong. I can smell it. Nothing has gone wrong. It's just this election and all the mess it's created. It's just bad timing, that's all. I don't want to know about timing. I want to know about my husband. Is he going to be let go, or not? Absolutely. What you have to realize... is that to some people... the outcome of this election is more important... than your husband or my wife. You're not trying to stall me, are you? Of course not. It's just a matter of transporting him... to wherever you want him to be. Well, when is it going to be...exactly? Soon. To be safe... I'd say as soon as the polls close. Now, remember, my wife's in this, too. Hey, a deal's a deal. I got to have Johnny before I'll turn loose your wife. And also no one better try to follow him... because if I see anyone suspicious around... your wife will wake up in a pile of dirt... only she won't wake up. Get it? There will be no problems, young lady... unless you create them. Now, I hope you won't go back on your word. I've never gone back on my word. It's good we understand each other, mister. Johnny knows where I'll be. When I see him and when we can get away safe... then your wife can go, OK? Yeah, I understand. You want to say something to her now? Uh, that's not necessary. I trust you. I don't want to get her excited, you know? Yeah. OK. You know the story. Send him home. He didn't want to talk to me? What? Oh, yeah. Sure he did. He just didn't want to, you know, upset you or nothing. Well, all I know is these women brought her here. Well, who are these women? What's their official capacity? Everyone seems to be ignoring mine. Well, actually, it was Addie Parker... who called me about her, and I told her about you. All right. That's another sore spot. Just stop right now. Things are looking good, Red. You're going to be back with old Heinie... before you know it. I am not pleased with the way this whole thing... has gone completely haywire. Blondie, hello. What are you... Oh, I see. You found Pearl at the station. Oh, well, thank you, Blondie. That was very nice of you. Nothing to it. Oh, well...oh, Mrs. Stilton. Well, I've got things to do. Thanks for helping out. Thanks very much. Lovely to see you, Mrs. Stilton. We've met several times. I'm Nettie Bolt. The Junior League. You two know each other, huh? Oh, I guess so. You do remember me, don't you, Mrs. Stilton? Yeah, you're...Nettie Bolt. Junior League. I'm sorry. Is it something that I've said? She's just not remembering things too clearly today. Know what I mean? No, Blondie, I have no idea what you mean. I'm very confused here this afternoon. Mrs. Stilton kind of got herself hooked on opium. Good Lord. Opium? Hey, it's OK. She's going to be all right. I'm taking care of things. Mr. Stilton hired me to look after her at times like this. Heinie's in Washington, you know? President Roosevelt. I'm sorry. Heinie? Henry. Oh, yes. Henry Stilton. Yes. He's a very important man. Yes, he is. So at this time, forget about it all. He doesn't want any nasty scuttlebutting... and especially from someone like you, huh? Yes, Blondie. I don't gossip. It's not in my nature. Well, it was lovely to see you. I'm off to find Pearl Cummings. I have these goodies for her. Hello. What you going to do to those boys who did it, Seldom? I've been thinking about that. Blue is already feeding the dogs. It's the white boy. I haven't made a decision on him yet... but I think you got a vote in that. What do you think? Shit, I don't know. It's got to be something bad... considering how my luck is going. Oh, it's going to be bad. The question is, how bad? You go on downstairs, play a little bit more. We'll take care of it. Yeah, well, I'm going to need another stake, Seldom. I think it's time I go against those dice for a while. I'm going to need another five grand. Oh, what the hell. You might as well make it five more... if I'm going to break that game. Good luck, Sheepshan. What's the matter with you? I don't know. I'm very tired, I guess, now. Yeah, well, quit your moping. You're alive, right? This is it. Over. End of the line. What do you mean? We're waiting. Close the door. Close the door! We're waiting here for Johnny, then we're leaving. Don't worry. We'll play clean. We'll, uh, drop you off someplace... so you can find your way home. How's that sound? Sit down. This must look pretty crummy to you, huh? Hey, Daisy. I love it. Oh, well, that's a shame. What's a shame? Well, you're not going to be living here much longer. Oh, yeah. Right. So what? I don't care. Anyplace with Johnny's great with me. Wherever home is, I'm going to love it. I can smell Johnny when I'm in this house. I don't. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Just kind of jumpy, I guess. He's not going to be home... until after the polls close anyway. I know how these politicians think. So this is Johnny, huh? Yeah. Handsome, ain't he? Yeah. He's a killer. Yeah. Hey, you see that tie? I got him that. Six dollars. Pretty fancy. And this is you, right? Yeah. Don't you look pretty. Hey, wait here a second. Tonk tells me you want to see me. Well, I've been thinking. Ain't no way I'm walkin' out of here a free man. I know that. One way or the other, you got my life. It's yours. 1 got, uh, no say no more. I was also thinking... if you kill me, might cost you down the line. Killing the whitey, I mean... how are they going to look at you... black man killing a white man? Even if he deserves killing. See what I'm saying? Maybe the Italians get down on your ass. Right now things are good with the Italians. Yeah. Nobody causes you no trouble, everybody gets along. Then this robbery happens, Italians hear about it. Blue gets fed to the dogs for his part. What's that? One nigger kills another, so what? But killing a white man, that's different... as far as the Italians are concerned. See what I'm saying? You know yourself what I'm saying is true. How's this going to affect you? That's what we're talking about here, is you. I figure you already got my life... whether you kill me or not. I'm your servant. You want a cup of coffee, I'll get you coffee. You want any job done... don't make any difference to me what it is. You want Blue cut up for dog meat... I'll do that, too, because I got no say. I owe my life to you. That's how you ought to look at this. Got yourself a slave. How's that for a switch? Johnny O'Hara belongs to you. Johnny O'Hara works for Seldom Seen for life. How's that sound? Son of a bitch talks more than ll do. That it? Yeah. You got guts. Yeah, now they're yours. What do you say? Your guts? Everything's yours. That's OK. Yeah. That doctor friend of Bennie Moten's... what's his name? Uh, uh... Russ Whitehall. Russ Whitehall. Tell him I want to talk to him. Red? Get over here. I need your help. Take your coat off. I'm going to put you to work, little lady. All right. What do you want me to do? Take the comb with the bleach... run it through my hair in sections. Ooh! This stuff smells bad. Don't tell me. Make sure you get the roots. Is this going to burn? Burns my scalp, but don't burn your hands. Just got to wash them real good after. Last time I did it, I used too much peroxide... all my hair fell out-- Blah! Right in the sink. Pink mush. Thought Johnny was going to leave me. I looked like a drowned rat. So what did he do? He was so sweet. He said, "Angel, I think it's all going to be all right... "if I never see you without your hat on...” and he did all the marketing for a whole month. Oh, that's very sweet. All right. 1 think I've got it now. Hey, you know what I was thinking? Huh? I'm not getting sentimental or anything. Don't think that. I'm just curious. Where do you think you will go after all this is over? I don't know. Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Well, it seems like there's a lot you don't tell me. Like what? Well, you didn't tell me you had a kid. I didn't have a kid. I mean, I had a kid, but I didn't keep her. So what? Well, so don't you care what happened to her? I mean, she must be someplace. Yeah. In heaven. Couple from Iowa adopted her. She had some lung thing. Couldn't breathe. She died. She was only two years old. She didn't know she was here. Didn't hurt. Spitting image, right? Want something to drink? Like dipping your tongue in Lux. Smoke? You hear something? Yeah, I think I hear a car. I think I heard a car. Johnny. Hello, angel. Don't, angel. I'm hurt. Hmm? Yeah? Where? Everywhere. You want to sit? Yeah. Hey, lady, give me a hand, will you? Hey... You're freezing cold, Johnny. Freezing cold. Those guys are really mad. Yeah. I got you home, though, didn't 1? Yeah. Johnny? Johnny? God! What'd they do to you, Johnny? Red? Red! They hurt him real bad. They cut him. OK. OK. You're going to be OK. You're going to be OK. I got you home. Red, come here! You got to help me! I got to stop the bleeding! He's bleeding bad! Red, we really got to... He's bleeding real bad. He's bleeding real bad here. Do something! Johnny, you're going to be OK. He's going to be OK, right? Red, help me! Please! Please, Johnny, I can't. I can't live without you, Johnny. Red... I'm losing him. Don't leave me. I'm not going to make it without you. Red! Please! I can't! Johnny... Johnny, don't worry. I'm not going to leave you. I'm here. I'm here. Please help me! Please help me! Please help me! Please help me! Please. Good evening, Mrs. Stilton. Aw, Carolyn... You know what 1 didn't do today? I didn't vote.
