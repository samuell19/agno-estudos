What's wrong now? The great love? Couldn't you start with a small love? No, the big one straightaway! You know, Stef, before the end of the week I'll find you a chick. You'll just have to bend down. You already master that. I know all of your tricks. No, thanks. No, no, thanks. It's true that last time was not... I admit, it's true... we came across a nutcase. A clinical case. But, you know, I'll tell you one thing, Stef... We will perhaps not set the bar too high, ok? Although, having it off with a minger is not that simple. Mingers are dreadfully distrustful. We'll start with a plain Jane. Before the end of the week you'll meet the love of your life! Dikkenek: big dickhead, boaster, big mouth, Mr or Miss Know-it-all. Yeah, Monique, it's me. Do me a favor. Cancel my appointment with the two morons from the TV school. I don't have time for that. I don't mingle with this kind of assholes. - Which school? - IAD. IAD? Totally unknown. Never heard of it. Well, it's for this so-called final year work? How long will that last? 7-8 minutes? Let's start. You don't say 'action'? Ho, brat! Ho! I'll introduce myself in two words. I am Claudy Focan... semi-professional photographer... No, cut. Cut! Actually, I said that because I was looking your lens. This is digital, right? 35 mm. In fact, I am a photographer of... well, I shoot erotic photos. It's a little bit beside the point. Let's start over! In two words, I'm Claudy Focan. Mr. Focan. I'm the slaughterhouse of Anderlecht's Director and sales marketing manager. This is the sales hall. When the animals arrive, they are 150 in a lorry. Why 150? Like that they do not stumble during the transportation. When they are here they simply follow the white line. And we lead them unavoidably - two by two - to the slaughter zone. Perhaps it's not the funniest part... although... When they arrive we shoot them in the back of their head with a cattle gun. And the deflagration is so strong that... I never had to shoot twice if you know what I mean! We could go watch them slaughter some pigs if you want but anyway that's my guilty pleasure. Once the beast is dead, it goes... Well, we move it because it can't walk anymore. Listen, brat, you're pissing me off with your micro. You shoved it in my face over there! Stop it and do your fucking job properly! Sorry, I'm irritable. I know. It's not all your fault. But it seems I got the IAD's two clowns. The worst of the worst! How do you make a Fricadelle? (fried sausage) I was coming to the point. There's a time and a place for everything. You're not going to tell me what I have to say. So, a Fricadelle how is it done? You should know two things: On a 700 kg beast, there are 350 kg that are considered as matters or leftovers unsuitable for consumption. In a butcher shop, you will never see nostrils... a scrotum, an anus or intestines, for example. What do you think we do with bowels? The bowels are not more than digested grass. Also commonly called 'shit', for your information. So we scrape the whole thing. We put everything in a big basin - we call it a "pool" Then we add products. Which one? Tranquillizers, antibiotics, colorants... That's our little recipe. The "Belgian cooking", like we say. Once this matter looks like meat again we thread it into entrails and it's sent to chip stands, shops... as fricadelle and merguez. I want to check what you've recorded. Understood? Image rights exist for a reason. You got it, stupid? I'm not threatening you but you got the message. I'll find you anytime. Understood? Both of you? Because I don't send recorded letters. One morning you'll wake up in a tank. How is it going, Polish? Gimme a large pack of chips with sauce, please. Which sauce? No idea. Dallas sauce, but put the sauce to one side. And three meatballs with that. Omar! The sauce to one side or on the chips? On the meatballs! And add 6-7 Fricadelles too! - Seven Fricadelles with that... - 10 beers, please! 10 Vedettes. He feels so comfortable this one! Are you blind or what? I was ordering food. You're playing with your life, you! Sorry, sorry. I thought you... What's your problem son of a bitch? Come on! - Calm down now. - A Problem, Aziz? That guy comes relaxed, doesn't apologize and overtakes me! You're polite or not polite, you? - Stop. - Loser! I thought you'd be on a school trip. I knew it was you. With your old rapper's accent! Hip-hop! And that habit you have to spit everywhere like a lama. It's excessively annoying. Hey, Stef. - You know each other? - Yeah. He's my friend. And you speak to him differently. Say you're sorry, now! - Sorry... - A beer? - No, I don't drink beer. - What is that? Fricadelles. You want some? You know what's in it? I've seen a reportage about it. - Anyway, there's no pork in it. - Pork? Certainly not. But give that to a dog and he won't eat it. There is a stain. Can I ask you something? Don't take it the wrong way. What's your plan once school starts again? Because we were wondering with Baudouin. Your grades are so bad... Because university is nice, but you must study a little bit. You can not keep on failing every year. It's failure on failure. But partying, sleeping late... There's no difficulty. You got a honorary distinction. Although I didn't go to university if I'm unemployed today it's not my fault. My life stopped at 17! My goal was to be an attorney and not to have kids with that jerk! I wanted to be a great psychologist. Help people... be helpful, Doctors Without Borders, and all that shit. One alcoholic night ended it all. And when your parents died, my life changed as well. On the day of the funeral, I suddenly had to become a mother! Listen, baby, don't take it the wrong way: I always treated you like my own daughter. - I don't want you to be led astray. - Listen, auntie... I also reflected on my life. You're like my mother, I care about you. And the more I think about it, the more I think... I wanna do exactly like you. - What? What are you trying to say? - Doing nothing. Like you. Finally, it's that the goal in life, huh? Succeed in doing nothing. Come on! Follow me! Cindy? You always have to stand out. Hey fat ass, can't you read? It's forbidden to eat in museums! I hope this visit will ruin your appetite! Hello. Here's the money. Welcome to the road crash Museum. Never forget the seatbelt! That way you wont repaint the car with your brain! Well, children? Who wants to play dead? Who has been in a car crash? You? You? You? Nobody? It will happen later then. At 18 you start to drink... and you want to impress your friends... and bang, it's the crash guaranteed coming back from Louvain-la-Neuve. You, Charlotte, you know what a windshield is? If you look more like Captain Harlock than Candy... It's because your mom drinks. Nice fence, huh? The guy in question broke his bones 137 times. 137 fractures, it's much, huh? Not to say, impressive! Come, come look! Come closer, it wont bite! You want to sit on the bike, you? I feel it! You don't want to? It doesn't matter. Go ahead! Next attraction! The teacher is dead! Now we'll observe a minute's silence... for all those people behind me. That's it! It's billing and cooing in here. Is this is a porno theater? What? Come a little closer. What is this dud? The story of two girls looking for their sexual identity. Sexual identity? It doesn't mean anything! Or someone has to explain to me! It's terribly slow, uh? Every time I go to the cinema, I fall asleep. Big boobs, a round belly, fat thighs... It's different. Different from the magazines, uh? I bet my life it's gonna be about the asshole! "Sexual identity!" What's his problem? Have we met? Fabienne? How I know you it's you? Your name was on the screen. - Excuse me! - You are silly. - You don't wanna go out to take your call? - Shut up! I'm talking. No, I wasn't talking to you. It's a moron. Yeah, a spastic. - Take your call outside or turn off your phone. - What? Buy cotton buds! He asked you to go out to call your bitch. You want to fight, jerk? - I'm waiting! Come on! - This guy is totally crazy! You keep standing in the cinema? Sit down! And look ahead! You've seen that, ma'am? He's got nerves! Do I call when I'm inside the cinema? Yes, Fabienne? No, it's nothing. An idiot! He's doing it on purpose! No, I wasn't talking to you! You never understand, you're really stupid! - Stop! - The first one is a lesson, dickhead! The 2nd is for the principle. And the 3rd, because things always come in threes. - Who is this? - JC speaking. Hey... JC, right? What are you doing on August 15? I'm going to celebrate my 18th birthday... I'm going to organize a party in Zoute. It's gonna be nice. Whole Belgium is invited. Who is that cuckoo? She's also been rocked too close to the wall? Here. Compliments of the baby manager. Another one? That one must have been painful! What I like in this club is that palace-like way... Like Pretty Woman. This little... Didn't sleep well? All good, Dominique? Last time, you allowed Albanians to come inside... You shouldn't let that in. It has to remain our place, you understand? I haven't told you because it was crowded, but... Not bad, huh? The dance floor is over there. All good, Dom? You sleep here? - Here is the most handsome! - Daisy! I had not seen you... Any news? A beer, please. I'm so thirsty I'm dying. I'm so sweaty. - What's up? Well... It's not easy. No... currently I... struggle. It's really a daily struggle. I swear. So far... I take it right in the kisser. One problem after another, everything goes down hill. Huge problems with rabies, dioxin... It's an endless repetition... - Talking about old sows, how is it? - You're always so mean to me! - It's just a joke. - How is it going with your bird? You know, Daisy, I'm not a fool. If I'm always in pleasant company... it's for my money, and not for my odor. And it hurts to know that. I am perhaps the only one in Belgium to know, but... Her name is Natacha, right? Yeah Michael Jackson! I like that! He's the only white guy who makes music like blacks. You can say whatever you want... I like him! I like him so much! In two words: above him there's nobody, below him there is no one either! Carmelo, turn up the volume! I'm the only one dancing. It's my gun you're looking? Very dangerous. A semi-automatic Czech gun, light plastic, 17 shots. It can stop a moving school bus. Maybe even a plane! Never tried, but I think its possible. Firearms are my passion since I'm a kiddo! There's no explanation. Some people are into dolls, others... - Can we...? - What brought you here? Two guys assaulted me in the cinema. They almost stabbed me. They had no knife, but still... they struck my back, ripped my jacket and stole my brand new cell! Fortunately I know judo, so I could handle the situation more or less... And how did you guys look like? Something like this here? No. - Or like this? - No. So this? They looked the same. More or less... You need to make an effort. Otherwise I can't help you! It was this guy there. This kind of guy. What, him? He did it? But why would he? For fun? It will let Natacha have her wicked way with you. Believe me. Which one? This one? Make no mistake! I poured a huge dose in it. I was looking for you. I thought you had left. Here... Cheers! I was in the cinema with a young girl... And then it seemed my mobile phone have rung. Wait! We tell you to turn off your phone before the movie. And there's an other warning after the adverts. We won't turn on the light every 5 minutes to tell you to turn it off! - It was off! - True or not? - Yes or no? Am I right? - Yes! When I go to the cinema with my wife we get... bad seats, people playing with their phone... talking people... Because when the movie starts, the concert starts too. And it stinks. People stink even more in movie theaters. Anyway, I'll call my friend who works for the RIAA. He's not a singer! Are you listening? I got it! Let's say he looks like it. I'll make an identikit. I'm not bad, but I don't draw like Tintin. But Tintin is fictional! Just what I said. I don't draw like Tintin. - How did he look like? - He was... small... - The face! The shape of the face... - Boney... Long, greasy hair in the neck. And a mustache. With a big nose! A big conk! He smelled booze! You could smell it in the whole cinema. Where do I find a Mercedes coupe? I do know it's a best seller in Africa. Your last minute orders are excessively annoying! Stef, I'm on the phone! Is my BMW ready? Because I'm always good to do you a favour. Damn, check that! Fuck! Goddammit! - JC, look! - Damn! What a wad of bills! Move, asshole! Yeah, it's me. Greg! Damn, I've got a big problem! - So you're not dead, it's the main thing. - My mobile has been stolen. And your SIM card? You have to cancel it? It's impossible! It's a hacked no costs SIM card from ebay. Please, Fabienne, come pick me up! You're on your own. Take the bus! This is a public phone booth, for your information! - Two seconds. - Wanker! Could you give me thirty seconds? Sorry it was just a dick. So got my request? - I really need you to pick me up! - Where are you? You're on Poulertte Place, not on the Croisette! I'll hang up. The guy's face is slightly red. I'll hit him with a Japanese forearm blow in his face! Bye. Either you come out or I get you out! You decide. - Come on, Come on! - Get out or I get you out. You're pissing me off! You wanna fuck with me? Asshole! Your glasses, fuckwitted! Maybe you'll see things more clearly next time! Mom, Claudy speaking. I've been carjacked. I said that I've been carjacked. The car has been stolen. No, I could do nothing, I tried to run after but what do you wanna do? No. With my leather jacket inside. With the 70,000 bucks in... I feel nauseous! Your glasses? Mom, they're in the glove box! The glove box remained in the car. Say, can you come where we used to play snooker with dad? Go to the cafe with a big 'Duvel' sign! Come right now because... I wanna leave this city! All this violence is driving me crazy! Stef your office is nice! For God's sake! Good morning, Madam. What a heat, huh? I'm wet. I feel like shit. But it's gonna be fine. I woke up late too. Sometimes we need to ease off on the pressure. We can't always live like a saucepan on the stove. Say, Stef... I have a small question. It's about my niece, Natacha. Currently it's not going well. A small post-adolescence crisis. Do know who I'm talking about? A cutie who is always walking around, looking for her panties. Never met. You want a drink? We don't have to be formal. Would you like a drink? Yeah, I'd like to. Alcohol? Soft drink? If you have a small can. A Vedett would be great. Soft is not your thing, huh? Not really, no... What is this thing? No, Aziz. Watch it! Scratches everywhere! Who would buy that? A curly-haired like you? Okay, 50 for these. - Take it or leave it. - You still have croco jackets? Croco is not trendy anymore. Snake is back but leather is trendier. Want one? Move. Hey, Marco? When you're done, gimme the jacket on the back seat. Take the jacket on the back seat. Don't hurry up, y'know. You got highlights? - It's a failure. - Yeah it's too red. I think I'll cut. But the other likes long hair. I leave you. You can get by with your cowhide. Look that, brat. A nice leather jacket. - You sure it's fashion? You have more like that? - It's not H&M in here, Aziz. You also want a fitting room? It's too big. Are you trying to trick me? - What did you say? - No, that came naturally... - I knew it. - Excuse me. - No, it's not too big! - I look good? It's the new trend, Aziz. All the girls are gonna succumb to your charm. Damn, man, your jacket smells like shit! - It's the leather. - On my mother's head. It smells like a pig. Clean it, what do you want me to say! Okay! The 2 mobiles for the jacket. Agreed? - You want a PlayStation? - I have one. I want that bike. Normal price is 400, but for you its 350. It's an Eddy Merckx. It's not a shitty one. - For real? - Of course. Hey, viking! I'll pay you tomorrow! See you, JC. Say, you know that there's a chick with cocker-eyes in your trunk? - For the car? Can you pay me now? - Okay. But you take your spare wheel. Hi, I'm JC. You ok? Its not a car but a Kinder Surprise Egg! Can I have two beers? Oh! Don't drink everything, fattie! Look at his damn face! He looks like his father, he's ugly. We tried to place him but it didn't work. Our beers! It's like junk mail, it's always coming back. I can't put him down... Sorry, I had not seen you. Gimme a beer. I'm dying of thirst. And a cool one, if you have that! - The same one? - Yeah, the same one! And gimme another glass. This one tastes like soap. I like foam, but you should not exaggerate! You think everyone's retarded? Bring me its little sister. - The same, so? - I said so. The little sister. Sure you're covering the spot? - I'll go. - No. Stay. Thank God, my mouth wasn't open. Is it the break or what? So you're the one who took all the cubes from the fridge! What's wrong? I'm not talking to you. Go play with your mower, stupid! Give me the ice! Would you calm down? This guy did nothing. You talkin' to me? When you need money for shopping it's alright, uh? - Go away! - I'm gone! Weren't you taught to eat with your mouth closed? I'm talking to you! I feel like next to a garbage truck! Bitch. It's excessively annoying to hear someone eat chips for those who do not! Understood?! Minimum education, uh? A trip to the slaughterhouse and it's gonna be quick. Small cock... With his big toy. A small dick, like Baudouin. I brought this. There are a lot more. Thank you. Very nice of you. I was about to get out. Coming, my little Dim. Fuck! Filthy sow! Hey, Mom! Mom! Goddamn it, always the same thing! You don't kiss your mother? I can't anymore, Mom... It was crazy. It took a second! I'm only realizing now what happened. I couldn't do a thing! I was despondent. I don't have the words. I can't anymore... I'm worn out. I want to go home, put my slippers on and take some rest. Don't look at me. I don't wanna explain the story because I can't. What a story. Alcoholism is really the scourge of the century. But the worst is that he was never drunk. Never! For me with 2 drinks I kiss everyone. It's not working with Baudouin for now. - I can see that. - What? That? No, this is your wife. Excuse me. I have heard that she's... not really your wife anymore. She'll come back. When she'll need money. She knows well enough who's got the money. If it can help, Baudouin also had an affair with an Asian chick. But now... it's the past. When she'll be back. Ask her for a test. I'll use condoms. I don't understand. She has everything. We go 3 times per year on holiday, we go to cinema... Note that the cinema is to see people... because I have a Home Cinema. More than 300 DVDs. Soon 800, thanks to the Internet. I like Cinema. You have to go to cinema. We go to cinema. I can't remember the last movie we saw... Wait... Wait... Yes! it's a story about a family of ducks that go to Africa. - I don't know. That being said you cook duck very well. Thanks but I'm not into movies featuring animals. Documentaries are fucking boring. You should keep an open mind. It's a wonderful movie. What's its name again? Winged Migration! Yes, Winged Migration! It's incredible! How did they manage to record it? Maybe they attached a camera to a duck. Say, it's not my business... but be careful with alcohol. You drink like a fish! Six months ago I saw an advertisement. It said: "Urgent. Professional Photographer looking for young girls." So I met him and I asked if it was porn. He: "No, no porn. It's art." And he looked nice. But I had to go to his home. Can you wear that, please? Claudy! - Yes Mom? - I was looking for you. Come! No, I'm shooting now. With my model. - With whom? - Natacha! That little whore! Don't judge her. You don't even know her and you judge her. Balls or chips for dinner? Or croquette. I'm busy, mom. It doesn't matter. - Is that not somewhat vulgar? - Vulgar? - You think it's vulgar? - Yes. There's something I don't understand. I'll tell you something. The artistic part, it's me. So, it's not your business. If I ask to wear these shoes, there's a reason. I work in black and white. I must emphasize the colors. Or it'll be dull. You don't know that. Because it's not your job. Take off your panties too. Why, no? But what the fuck are you doing here? You came to an erotic photo shoot and you won't undress? I didn't force you to come! You chose to come. And now you pretend you're ingenuous? If it's like that, it's over. Don't play with my balls! - You're strained like a cramp. - No, I'm not strained. Yes, you are. If I tell you you're strained, you are. Don't say you're not then. You just have to tell me: "Claudy, I'm strained. I am not at my ease." You must let you come to me. And I'll get you. Don't worry. Why do you only photograph naked teenagers? What's the matter? What did you just say? Repeat! Are you naked? It's a serious offense! You try to make me look live a pervert. Don't mess with me! My work is a pain in the ass. This is for my pleasure, you understand? I don't need that to make a living. I have enough money. Everything is good. Maybe it's your problem. You are here for the bees and honey. Maybe that's why you're stressed. Sex-starved cunt! Bend over now. It's not hard, uh? Yes, a little bit more. I didn't ask the impossible. Take off your panties. Your panties. You need a hand? See? Spread your legs, now. More. A bit more. That's too much. Stay like that. Don't move. You ok? Pretend you're in love with me. More... Oh wow! A lil bit more. That's it. Now I'll take the picture. Don't move. I'll get the pony. You are not easily scared. What a story! He is just too horny. And it's not my fault if that dick fell in love with me. That's it. If you need help... you can always call me. Thanks for everything. Goodbye. Sheknows how to thank people. I'll also take two apple pies. - That? - That there. - These triangles. - The samosa's. Excuse me. I was wondering... do you sell... What's the name again? Weed? Five hundred. Thank you. - Everything good? - Yes, and you? I wanted to ask you something. A friend of mine is going to live to my place for some time. Because she has problems with her husband. I wanted to warn you that we might be somewhat noisy. Because she's wild? Like a tigress? Whip, leather, latex, self propelled dildo? I won't lend you my King Kong dildo. Don't worry. She's more like... water bottle in the bag... school teacher... - Alright, I see. And how is Evelyne? She's sulking and she's blaming me. It seems that I smell of alcohol when I come back from work. And of cigarette too. "I have the feeling to lick an ashtray." 35 years and I have to hide to smoke. How could her cocaine be any better? I am cop, shit! How much for this? 10 grams. OK. I'll pretend that I've lost it. It's a topsy-turvy world. He wants to find me a chick and he's fucking her. Hey, D! Your pal is here. - You are here? - Yes, I am here. Sorry, I had a setback. I see. Say hello, Sabine. Hello Sabine. Wait for me in the restaurant. Come on, my little cat. You wanna play? Where is the ball? The ball is waiting for you... like me. And now you wait for me, because I'm beating Brazil. I'm not bothering you? You're not cold? I'm freezing! - You were quick. You came with a car? - Yes. A douche's car. There are 4 alarms on the key to open it. And it never stop talking. "Take that way. Not this one." But it's hard to find the reverse. I can't believe he lend you his car. I didn't ask. And you should have seen how he was. "Nadine, I love you! I promise. I won't go out anymore!" "I'll quit drinking. I'm sorry." Words, words... He'll be mad. What's in your bag? Your attention: Room 1 your two favorite German bitches... Greta and Cynthia... accompanied by their shepherd... also German! Room 2. Jong meisje op zwart long tisjen! Is it rush hour or what? What a mess! - Hey, you! - Me? You're doing nothing. Come here with your mop. I'll give you work. Did you see this cabin? You think it's clean? Do you think it's clean? I'd like to feel comfortable in here. I don't want to break a leg. It's a real skating rink. Hurry up! The cards... The cards! Yes, excuse me. That's 300. With this one you'll need lubricant. Is that you, sir? I'm not Arthur, but you can thank him. Here, my treat. I'm surprised I couldn't jizz with 50 euro. Let's hope it will stick. Hello, mister and misses. Can I have change, please? Coins for the parking meter. Wasn't the girl in the microwave hot? She was. But romanticism was missing. You don't have much time left to find the woman of my life. Because your promises... Here is just to shoot your load. It's not a take away. And listen, I kept an eye on you inside. It was a test. Now I'll get the perfect match. And forget that peepshow, goddammit! In the food processing industry, hygiene is no joke. I mean the fines are very big. So a worker has to have the full equipment. A small example will say more than words. Yesterday I came in the cutting room... 2 times a day, always unexpected... And Giovanni had not his hat on. I fired him right away. No need to talk like "Yeah, but no, I was looking for my keys." Not with me! There is never anything on the fucking TV! Baudouin, you will not believe me! The bastard has already replaced her! - Who you talkin about, bird? - About Dimitri! He has already replaced his wife! And the new one is very fit. That jerk is not gonna stay single all his life! She'll empty his balls! Baudouin, you are so classy. I can't believe he's fucking a random whore. Wait! He's spitting on her! What violence! But that madman is pulling her hair! - Pull it, yeah. - I'll never talk to him again. I knew it. It's the alcohol. - Alcohol, Baudouin... - You don't know what alcohol is. He dropped her from the balcony. She must be unconscious. Damn, almost goal! I am sure he beat her up as revenge for Nadine. - Hello? - Tell my wife that I want to see her now. Nadine... Your dear husband... He's very rude in the morning. What a prick. I knew it! Courage! - Where's my car? Where have you left it? - Calm down! Your car is insured. - That's not the point! Where's my car? In France, loser. That fat car is your sole priority. You're such a nut head. It's over. OK? You could crawl after me, it's over. Get lost! You finally came to understand. Go away and live your enslaved life. Go to work it's already 7 am. And go drink with your friends 'till 5 am. And learn how to make love to a woman. - I'm sick of sleeping with a fridge. - Then buy yourself an inflatable doll. Good idea. Its mouth will suck my dick instead of yelling at me. - I hate you. - I beg your pardon? I said "I hate you". You disgust me. That's not how it's going to be. Fucking blazing heat! - Hi JC - Hi Dove, hi Marc. - Do you want a drink? - Thanks but I have already a beer. - Could we talk? - Yeah what's up? - My daughter is a party-animal. I'm overrun. What should I do? No idea! Break her legs? Please stay focused it's a serious matter. - What's her name? - Alice. So it's Alice in Alcoholland. Pleasing curves for a teenager. Seek me out in 10 years! I have to see my pal over there. - No one here? - There is someone! Mich! This guy took your seat. There's not enough seats in here? You had to pick mine? There's another one here, and here. Hand mine back! You should avoid... filthy racists like you! - Say it again. - Stop it! I didn't understand. What's the matter, minger? New year eve's headbutt wasn't enough? Same price for the next one! And a Duvel, please. Say, joker? You want a beer? Is your husband always barking like a dachshund? Take that, Dikkenek! Enjoy! Cheers. - Nice song. What is it? - That is Ghinzu. - It's English. - Turn up the volume. - The same? - Yes, the same! Your friend's gonna have fun! He'll beat the shit out of him! I know everybody doesn't like me. But I wonder if I really care. What now? Still sulking? It's never right anyway. Every time I shoot, she's sulking. It's not jealousy, but it looks like it. I won't stay there forever. Look that! Claudy! This thing doesn't work! Lose 20 Kg, you'll be able to climb it. Claudy! Did you hear me? I'm coming, dammit! She's driving me crazy. I told 20 times to turn on the engine. There you go. You know what time it is? In two words, I am a photographer... and I'm looking for models. My number. If it interests you... I'm interested. Nice ass. Flemings... For once a hot fleming! They are so prude! Well, well... Let's see... There are quite a few ads: "Roommate", "babysitting", "rent a room"... It looks better now. I hope the fish'll take the bait. - Miss? - Is it well paid your stuff? - Is it well paid? - That depends on you, honey. What does it mean a book on the relationship between animals and women? It's exactly what it means. It explains the relationship... between a woman and an animal. It's not sexual photos? Listen, if it interests you, here is my number. Otherwise, see ya next weekend! What do you want? Is it possible... for me? Everything is possible. Everything is negotiable. There is no price tag attached. Are you shaved? Do you have friends? They didn't miss you there! Was it a horse or a sow? You saw your face? We can make a book on Halloween, if you want. Dirty bastard! Fix your face, alien! I'm lucky she left. She'd have got a stapler shot in the mug. My husband is used to this kind of problem. We already had something like that in Palma de Mallorca. I like Palma. I like Portugal. At that time it was for a sunbed. But here he's been bleed dry like a pig. And it's the aggressor that started it all. I swear on my twins' life! Hopefully my husband was not armed. Let's make an identikit. And we'll start a search operation. In short, the conventional procedure. How did he look like? Brown! - Brown... dark? - Yes, dark! Dark brown? Say it directly. - Well tanned. - What a coincidence, huh? I said nothing! Damn. What now? Is it the batteries? The lights stayed on? I'm not that stupid to turn on the lights by day. I'll check. It must be the engine. Damn! - The engine is not in the front? - Of course not! In sport cars, the engine is always in the back. However, for this model it's perhaps in the front. So? You will not believe me, but there is no motor there. I call a guy? Fucking phone! Goddammit! - JC? - It's you! - Not busy? - It's crazy, I was just thinking of you. Say... You know mechanics and engines? I can disassemble and assemble an engine eyes closed. And do the upkeep at the same time. In any case, cars are not your stuff, baby. No... not really. And... what are you doing this afternoon? I got it. Someone already got me like that. For a move. Well, I'll be nice. Where are you? In Chasse Pierre. Your job is not too hard? If you wanna grab balls, you can go to Rolland Garros. I know the big boss. I must throw them back. Otherwise I can't mow. Yeah... I'm reading a book on firing. I'm in Chapter 2 and I understood the whole thing. The writer is Donald Trump. He's stupid! Really stupid! Stop. You know what? You fucking suck. You're fired. Born idiot, and you'll die idiot! You're pissing me off! Slackers! Go away! Wait, you forgot your shit! Don't forget anything, jerk! Move! I don't want to see you anymore. Fucking loser and fucking shitty country! - Nadine. - Jean-Claude. Nice to meet you. - We can't find the engine. - The engine. Right, yes. Don't worry, I'm an expert. What does your husband for a living? You must be rich to buy that. Usually it's here. Maybe in the glove box. Stiflingly hot, huh? And mosquitoes! Where is Natacha? What's up? We can't find the engine. You're not topless? Wanna join us? Don't be shy. Who is the master? Come on, pig! My turn! I've never done that before. Don't touch my arm because my sunburn hurts. Damn! I forgot! My aunt is here! Do something! You need to move! If she sees you, we're dead. No, no, no! She is here! It's me! Three hours on the motorway for 10 km. Because a camper van crashed in front of us. Nothing left. All dead. A real BBQ! Sir! You need a mattress? - Can we play this game? - Stop it. He could hurt himself. He looks tough. How long can this jerk last? It stinks like a billy goat. Let's air the room. I will. One of these, I'll send you my Polish cleaning lady. Wait, sweetie. - You didn't drink them all? - I don't swallow that. That hurts, huh? You know those weird girls there? They're always together. Certainly dykes. We should take pillows. Take the pouffe. Not the ugly green! The one from Sahel... no, Israel. It's the same. - The one you stole? - The one YOU stole. Every time I come here, they are drinking white wine. I can't handle lesbians. Just to see them, that really bugs me. They can do what they want in their home. Wait! There's a naked guy! Just like you he's looking for his underwear. - Nice! - Sorry. I forgot my underwear. Wait. Did we forget your birthday? I'm a little scatterbrained lately. Always under pressure, thousand things to do. It's next month. Great, then we won't forget it! We went to NYC for shopping and since the attack it's so loud! Believe it or not Manhattan has now so much more sun light! And that weird big thing, ground zero, you've got to see that. You start to believe that a plane crashed into the towers! It's unbelievable! I don't want to boast but it was beautiful. Yeah and good for you to have such suppleness. Being stiff leads to injuries. Like skiing and stiffness. And what's wrong with your aunt? She's such a snob! And above all she's talking so loud! She's yelling! She was born on the Concorde so she's always traveling for free. That lead her to lose her grip on reality. We always stay at home during holidays. What? We've traveled through Egypt in a coach! I strongly advise against traveling there. Yeah it's true, it was 2 years ago. Laurence stayed in the hotel next to the pool and the women's locker room. - No way! - It's true! She can't resist small perky breasts. Nonsense! I stayed inside because outside terrorists were killing tourists. Me taking a tourists packed and bullets riddled coach?! No way! And for what? To see a mutt like lynx with a broken nose? A deckchair is more comfortable than 5 hours in a coach to see a pile of stones. Hey what's wrong with you? - Don't worry it will fade away if I don't move. - Fine! Don't move and shut up. What a chaos! I already told you about Natacha's friend? She left her husband. Come on, get up. Get up! You and your hangdog expression need to change. You should stop being a victim all the time. The sun rises with or without you! And if you don't get up, it doesn't care. No one cares! Ok. I get up. And take off that ugly underwear! Don't think I'm a fool, Stef. I'm not a social worker! - Hi, ma'am. May I sit? - Sure. I come for my note for the school. Because, I've supposedly stolen a turn table the other day. Right, yes! You are a bloody crook. But you look honest, I like your mug. I'll write your note. But just today! So, "I, the undersigned..." 'I' with 'e', feminine and plural... If you went to school, you'd know. "Ie, the undersigned, Captain Laurence Cochet..." declare on my honor... "to have interrogated..." Nice, uh? "Mr Aziz Alami, the..." When was that? The 12th, I knew it. At 12 past 12, ah! Thus it rhymes. Et cetera, et cetera! We'll make it very formal. A punk and a Latino are getting out of hand outside. - They're just my mates. - You have a lot of friends! What the fuck is wrong over there? Hey you Gypsy boy go back to your trailer! Get lost! Calm down, Michel. Now get the hell out of here! Fucking Latinos! You always need your gang? You can't come alone? He's an ass, but I like him. Move! - You look handsome. What's going on? - I met a girl. Great! What's her name? Fabienne. And she has a damn villa! - You like her for the villa or what? - Both. Be careful! Do you give her gifts and stuff? - Dunno. - You need to make her dream. Gift her some pebbles with a heart on it. She'll be happy! She'll think it's coming from the heart! - She will believe me? - Yes, you have to lie to women! You gotta be nice... How long are you gonna stay here? - You want a coffee? - You don't have work? Sure I want coffee! - Black coffee? - Of course, black! It's not yellow! - Can I have a coffee too? - Hey! Oh! - Thanks, ma'am. - It's OK and don't come back too soon. I like that brat. But it's also boring once they're gone. Hello? Yes. With whom I have the honor? Mrs Michiels? You should tell your name because... You are not my only client, if I may express myself like that. And a small customer. You know, it's 15 to 6 everywhere in Belgium and... we would like a piece of weekend too. If you had called 10 minutes earlier, I could have done something. Now the slaughterhouse is cleaned... and most of the staff is gone. To be honest, we're having a drink. Yes. One second. Ludo, what's still alive? That sick piglet from this morning? Mrs. Michiels, we'll do it this way: I'll give you a dead and a living beast. I'll slaughter the one alive on site. And the dead is charged. I'll wear civvies, so I do not load off! And such a beast weighs 40 kg, so do not come with a wimp. Ok, Mrs. Michiels. She's a fucking posh slut. Some people think the whole world turn around them. But she will pay. Because I don't charge VAT, but it's included in the price. Silly me! I send you a text and you are next to me! You're stupid? My mobile has been stolen! Don't care. I don't need it. Too many calls. My private life vanished. Think you're the only one on the road, asshole? Calm down! This guy can't jump the car in front of him. Shut up, will you? You know I don't like when you talk while I'm driving. Move! I'm the king of the road. Ready for your spanking, Stef? You have your cup? 'Cos I shoot cannonballs! Okay? Here it comes! Fuck off! That one was a easy. Not again that cell phone! First the yokel in the cinema. Not here! Turn that off, you know it makes me aggressive! Some Fabienne invites me to Zoute for her birthday. I had totally forgotten that cunt. We're gonna listen to supermarket music remixed by faggots. You don't wanna ask your girl to come with her friend? Nadine. Listen, Stef. I'll do you a favor. We'll go to Zoute. But first, I'll give you an advanced dating lesson. Listen carefully! It goes from A to the G spot. Don't try to be original. Your face is already original. Don't overdo it. So listen up. A: Be yourself! Two: When you talk to her... avoid to negotiate with her tits. Three: It's a thing I tried: - It's called "fall in the sus". - What? - Fall in the sus. - Sus? You pretend to have a malaise. "You fall in the apples", in French. As your head is only a meter above the ground your don't risk to suffer. Okay, listen. If you can stop this one... - What? - You can do her. That would surprise me. I'm in shape! - Take care of this twat. - Nice car. Sport cars... Always hard to get out. - Your ID, young man. - Gimme a minute. I know you! The interrogation... No, I see a thousand like you everyday so we don't know each other. So you give me car's registration, driver license, insurance, tutti quanti. - Never thought I had so much beers. - Sir! Hold your horses, sweetie! Almost done! Calm down! I'm wrongly parked? Do you know how fast you drove? No I never watch the speedometer. These cars are so fast! Probably 200. That's it. And you'll pay 200.000 bucks. What is it? - Speeding. - Go back inside. Speeding? Can I ask you where? Because I always pay attention. I keep an eye on you. Speeding? Measured with a mobile speed camera? - A fixed one. - A fixed? A fixed speed camera? I know that you are on bridges and all, but at some point I can't see you anymore. If I see you, I immediately stomp on my brakes. I don't care. I know high places people. Good for you. How old are you? Day D-1, but I bought... jut got my driver license. Then you'll practice now. You'll drive. And Mr is gonna sit in the dead seat. - No, women behind a wheel... - Shut up! Follow me to the police station. Very good. Better a good agreement than a bad trial, as they say. Indeed. But get fleeced by a fuzz, that's something else. Thanks. A bourgeois is like a pig. The older... Get your paws off of my seat! Where should I park here? I'll park here and block everything. I'll move only if I want to. Goddammit! You see where the dosh goes. That's not a house but a holiday center. Goddammit... Like in the movies. You don't see me? Don't see me? You're sulking? Don't. If they're not 200, you go back with me. That's it! You're an extra. As a precaution because I like professionalism. We are fat professionals. That's it Come, come. Don't do that. We have no style. Come. Come, come now... There's no "Oink! Oink!". It's like that! I'm still the boss. Stay with me, I don't know where we have to go. Goal! Stay there! Dirty snot monkeys! Go back in your caravan, dirty gipsy. Who's the beach's king? In your face, bastard! What a cute pig! It's a real one? No, an electrical one. I'm Claudy Focan. - Slaughterhouse of Anderlecht's Director. - Fabienne Michiels. I've got lost in this hood. Your mom told me to come to a white house with a red roof. But all houses look the same! - Is it a council estate? - No. I parked in front and watched the house. Gray with a black roof. Repainted last night maybe? Say, Nathalie, JC and you, it's serious? I mean... are you in love? What do you actually see in him? He is unpredictable, shy... very sensitive. I know, you can't see it, but... He still has a big mouth. What's his job? I don't understand. He always has a lot of money, and he doesn't work. - Don't tell me he's a thief. - No. He takes the money where there is some. It's not just the money. Take these bikes: don't tell those are rented! Not rented, but stolen! If you rent a bike, there is always a yellow label with the bike renter's name on it. Here there's only the bike brand! Cheers! And relax now. It's the only thing I do. - What do you think about Stef? - No more foursome, ok? Nadine, I am talking about Stef and you. He is sweet, but he is not my type. I should have taken my swimsuit. - What an ugly haircut! - How is it? Easy! I wanna blow you. This way... Goddamn! What a waste! And this macaque puts his paws on this ass. I'm sick of it. Very nice body. Show me. Curious to see what's under the panties. Money has been made to see things. Think about it. I'm not gone yet. Not now, Greg! I've got a thousand things to do! I've also things to do. And it is just a birthday. Can you help him to unload the pig? - What pig? - The pig! Move! You'll take the pig? It seems. You are thick as a cotton swab. The pig's heavier than you. Where is the pig? In the silica, in my car. Yellow Silica. On the left. The pig is in the trunk. Thanks, chef. I ordered a beer and not champagne. That's only 10 cl. Goddamn! Damn, my mom will kill me! Where do I put the pig? Nadine is really cute. I like her smell. She smells a bit like a baby's neck. I am a little stressed for tonight. Stop being so cerebral. You know the 7 points of seduction I've taught you. No, but seriously... I can not... Although, I don't know if it's gonna work... I'm joking! So you're Fabienne? And it's your birthday? Happy birthday, then. - You should eat asparagus. - Really? You're stupid or what? I can't stand it when someone is grabbing my breasts! They're just breasts! Damn, I'm gush bleeding! I am sick of it! 'Night. What do you do up there? I take a picture of the eclipse. I've been told we can see the stars. For your information the moon is behind you. You're aggressive! Calm down, I did nothing wrong. - I'm cool, brat. - There was no petting. What are you waiting for? An other hick can get her. We don't have the whole night. Push yourself if you want to reach the G spot. What do you think about Stef? He's not my type. Looks like he always has the flu. If he talks, you hear only the consonants. Go! I have to tell him everything! Bottom's up! I've never seen him without a glass in his hand. - How is it? - Good. Come here, you. What is your name? You know, you're hot! Well, I'll find my... man, who's flirting with a whore. Stop it! What are you doing? Have you ever seen yourself drunk? Beware, you'll fall in the water. Damn! He did it! What is he doing at the bottom of the pool? What is she waiting for? Dive immediately! I don't know him... - Here it is. - Is this your school? See you then. I had a very good night. You don't want to kiss me? What? I wanted to know if you'd like to kiss me, because... because I really want to kiss you. Me too. Call me. Listen, you've been assaulted 15 times in three weeks. By a psychopath, rich kids... In short, a national persecution! According to me, it's time to reassess yourself. Because everyone agrees to say that, maybe, that's a little bit your fault. So I'll give you a friend's contact details. He's psychologist. That's not a swear word. I think he can help you. His name is Dimitri. Winners. Unlike you... I want my mommy! And you need a new haircut. This one is very irritating. It's important to get the groceries. Girls keep a sharp eye on this. You could lose Nadine! Take some potatoes. Are these red? Sorry but your tractor is blocking the way. Please make some room 'Cos your handicap is not an excuse. Do you need something? Let's speed up! - Hello gentlemen. - Hello Madam. One time is enough to be gay. That's 49. Thank you. Sir! You forgot your change. You are miles away. There are more and more of their kind... You forgot something, my dear? Just call me Claudy. You've stolen my car. No and even if I knew something I wouldn't tell you, asshole. You've made a serious mistake. You know how serious it is. You're bogged down by your wrongdoings. Did you know that I took a good shower this morning? To smell fresh. Extra fresh. I imagined that I would fuck you in the ass. You're my little whore. You have a very nice ass. It has to be said: you've got no money but you have a nice ass. It's now time to be honest with you: you're disgusting. You're killing me. Even for free: if you paid me I wouldn't touch you. Do never forget this: Belgium... is as small as my handkerchief. I'm able to find you wherever you're hiding. And I'll bleed you to death whenever I want to. Keep that in mind... Does anyone know what a scourge is? No raised hands? Did anyone notice something? Nobody? Last week... Everyone remembers the museum tour. In the road crash museum. Well, I want... from the bottom of my heart... Apologize. Honestly! Kids... tell you how much... I love you! Because I... I was not... Let's say... normal. I know it... must have been terrible. Especially for you, Candy... Charlotte! Because of that! Weed! It's a drug! But it's also a plant. Be warned! I count on you to not rat me out to your parents. Especially you, Frédéric! Otherwise weed can be smoked and if you add strong alcohol you end up being sick. Very sick! It does make you laugh a lot Weed is neat but it's still a drug! Weed... is a scourge! You shall never NEVER never use it. Understood? But... while thinking out loud on our next school trip if you are well-behaved we might get a chance to share together this experience. But not a word to your parents! I've never felt something so intense. While making love, she was staring at me with her large Labrador eyes. I know! You can't teach an old dog new tricks. I think she's never been fucked like that. And I'm not boasting. She cried afterwards. This is a classic, man! After all the drug problems she had... and those threesomes. You mean... a gangbang? I am proud of you. Right to the G spot! - Don't forget to thank me! - Thanks, JC! - You're welcome, mate. Good. You can buy a dog now. I've spotted a house in the countryside. You need help to move, uh? You don't want children? You want to eat rabbit tonight? - Rabbit? It's so good! - Yes, with carrots! The problem is that we never find the courage to kill them. Say, JC, can you do it? Sure. Just have to ask. My pleasure. I don't have my cutter but it's fine. I will skin the rabbit, but not the carrots. The most important thing... is to hit it hard on the head. Without hesitation! Like that! Then you have to take off his pajamas... and I can even make a hood for your girl. Sensitive souls, close your eyes now. Goodbye, rabbit! Today I had no motivation to go to work. Natacha... Little slut. You've got no money but a nice ass. We're gonna check it out at the medical examination. We'll take a closer look during the autopsy. At the technical check, as they say. Benjamin Delautre is the guy who made the original fan subtitles for this movie. Many thanks to him! I've used his work to create the missing parts for the Director's Cut version and I've updated his translation and synchronization. Many thanks to the guys who motivated me to do this! I hope you enjoyed the movie.
