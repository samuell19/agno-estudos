I just drank some paint. Why, that's silly. I always drink coffee. Paint, eh? Let me see your tongue. Uh...huh-huh! Now, get back there and get busy. That's the trouble we have with help nowadays. [WHINES] Well, do I get my 97 bucks, or do I take the pastry back? Well, I guess the stuff goes back. Give it to him. No! Give 'em to me! [BARKS] [DISHES CLATTER] That does it! If I don't get my dough by Monday, I take over this restaurant! LARRY: Say, what does this job pay? Yeah. Do you think we can earn 97 bucks by Monday? Oh, it's up to you. You get a penny a poster for every one you put up. Now, make it snappy. Oh, boy! Ha-ha-ha! Hey, whiz kid. If we get a penny a poster, and hang 25 a day, when will we have 97 bucks?

Yeah, yeah. Well, there's a pipeline that connects the spareribs and comes down through the chopped liver, connected by a "homophagel," through the meatloaf. You drop up here to liverwurst, and a straight drop down to the auto club, where you get your 3 gallons. Of milk? No, gas. Yeah, where was I? Oh, yes. Then you get the "pometa" side of the thing here, and around the sukiyaki. You got the "pondersets" here. And that leaves the... frankfurters, and that's it. Ohh. Is that clear? Yeah, that's clear. But where do you get the milk? Sit down and start practicing! What's the matter with you? Get your hands on there. Ready? Ready. Go! Go! [MILK SWISHING] Faster. Faster. Faster! Faster!
