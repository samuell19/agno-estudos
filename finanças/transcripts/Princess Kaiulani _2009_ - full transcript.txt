( classical music playing ) Female narrator: IN THE KINGDOM OF HAWAII THERE LIVED A YOUNG PRINCESS, CHERISHED BY HER BELOVED PEOPLE. HER NAME WAS VICTORIA KA'IULANI KALANINUIAHILAPALAPA KAWEKIU I LUNALILO. SHE WAS NAMED VICTORIA IN HONOR OF ENGLAND'S QUEEN, AND KA'IULANI WHICH MEANS THE HIGHEST POINT OF HEAVEN. KA'IULANI'S MOTHER WAS SISTER TO KING KALAKAUA, HER FATHER A SCOTTISH GENTLEMAN. ( both laughing ) AS KA'IULANI GREW, HER ISLAND NATION FLOURISHED. HAWAII WAS ADMIRED BY THE WORLD FOR HER BEAUTY AND ABUNDANCE. BUT KA'IULANI'S LITTLE PARADISE WAS NOT DESTINED TO LAST. WHEN SHE WAS STILL A YOUNG GIRL, HER MOTHER PASSED AWAY. HAWAII'S PEOPLE WEPT FOR THE LOSS OF THEIR CHIEFESS... AND PRAYED FOR HER YOUNG DAUGHTER. DESPITE HER GRIEF, PRINCESS KA'IULANI WOULD SOON FIND THE GREAT PURPOSE OF HER LIFE IN THE COMING BATTLE FOR THE FUTURE OF HAWAII. ( children laughing ) Young Ka'iulani: MAMA... I STILL SEE THE LOSS OF HER MOTHER IN HER EYES. YES. - SHE FINDS GREAT COMFORT BEING - Ka'iulani: OH.R, YOU KNOW? - ALLOW ME. - King: GOOD. MY SISTER IS A LEADER, A PERFECT INFLUENCE FOR KA'IULANI. A FATHER'S HAND IS BENEFICIAL, EVEN IF, AS IN MY CASE, THE HAND IS SCOTTISH AND NOT HAWAIIAN. DON'T WORRY. TONIGHT THE PEOPLE WILL CELEBRATE THE LIGHTING OF THIS GREAT CITY... WITH THEIR HAWAIIAN PRINCESS, ARCHIE. MMM, NOT TOO OPULENT, I HOPE. - YOUR MAJESTY. - GIBSON. ( speaking Hawaiian ) DID YOU TOUCH THE PRINCESS? WHAT HAPPENED? DID HE TOUCH YOU? HE DIDN'T TOUCH ME. KOA, I SAID HE DIDN'T TOUCH ME. Koa: GET BACK TO WORK. CLEAN THIS UP. YOU COME WITH ME, KA'IULANI. WAIT! SO I CAN TELL YOU APART. Man: MAGNIFICENT, ISN'T IT? JUST FOR A PARTY? IT'S REALLY QUITE ELABORATE. - ( guests laughing ) - NO EXPENSE SPARED. TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS, SPENT AS THOUGH WE WERE THE ENEMY. WE NEED TO FIND A CONCILIATORY PROCESS THAT INCLUDES THE INTERESTS OF THE NATIVES. - PERSUASIVE. - MM-HMM. ALL INTERESTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. THEN WE STEP ASIDE AND LET THE FUTURE RUN ITS COURSE. ( rhythmic tapping ) LET'S GO. ( chatting ) HONORED GUESTS, A TOAST. TO MY NIECE KA'IULANI. MAY SHE GROW TO BE A LEADER OF THIS GREAT NATION ONE DAY. MAY THIS LIGHTING CEREMONY BE A GLOWING REMEMBRANCE TO OUR PEOPLE OF YOUR ROYAL BIRTHRIGHT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AT THE REQUEST OF HIS MAJESTY KING KALAKAUA, PRINCESS KA'IULANI WILL NOW LIGHT THE CITY OF HONOLULU FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. - I'M NERVOUS FOR THE CEREMONY. - DON'T BE. YOU'LL STAND PROUD FOR YOUR MOTHER. I KNOW IT. - Kalakaua: TO THE HOPE OF OUR NATION. - TO THE HOPE OF OUR NATION! ( applause ) ( chanting in Hawaiian ) - YOUR MAJESTY. - YOUR HIGHNESS. Man: WAIT FOR THE WORD. ( group reciting Hawaiian ) YOUR HIGHNESS, IF YOU WILL. - ( cheers, applause ) - ( band playing tune ) Man: LET'S GO, MEN. GO, MEN, GO! - ( shouting ) - GO GO, GET 'EM! - KA'IULANI! - PROTECT THE PRINCESS. Kalakaua: WHAT'S THIS INTRUSION?! THESE ARE THE VOICES OF HAWAII, THE CITIZENS YOU'VE CHOSEN TO IGNORE. THESE PEOPLE DEMAND A NEW GOVERNANCE. THEY DEMAND ELECTION OF A NEW CABINET AND THE DISMISSAL OF PREMIER GIBSON. THE KING WILL SIGN THIS CONSTITUTION OR WE WILL TAKE THE PALACE BY FORCE. - ( gun cocks ) - AHEM. HERE IS MY OFFER TO YOU: THERE WILL BE NONE OF MY PEOPLE'S BLOOD SHED TONIGHT; RELEASE PREMIER GIBSON, AND YOU WON'T BE SHOT RIGHT WHERE YOU STAND. ( distant shouting ) LET'S DO THIS NOW! COME ON. THURSTON! - RELEASE HIM. - Man: DO WHAT? - WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, THURSTON? - NOT NOW. YOUR MAJESTY, FOR YOUR SAFETY I SHOULD ESCORT YOU TO MY SHIP. - I'LL TAKE HER. - Kalakaua: NO, ESCORT MY NIECE ON BOARD. - NO, I DON'T WANT TO GO! - COME WITH ME. - AUNTIE! - GET IN THE CARRIAGE. WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN ACHIEVE BY THIS? - THIS IS MADNESS. - COME ON, PLEASE. - Man: THURSTON! - WE'RE RIGHTEOUS. - ( Ka'iulani shouting ) - GET IN THE CARRIAGE! - THURSTON! - ( clinks ) Ka'iulani: MY SHELLS, MY SHELLS! Archie: I'M GONNA GET YOUR SHELLS. Thurston: WE'RE PATRIOTS AND WE'LL BE TRIUMPHANT! - GO, DRIVER! - HYAH HYAH, CLEAR THE WAY! ( splashing ) HEY HEY HEY, STOP THAT. GET DOWN. COME AND HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT. YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR STRENGTH UP. IT'S A LONG JOURNEY TO ENGLAND. WE'RE LEAVING HAWAII? - I'M NOT GOING. - YOU HAVE NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER. - IT'S FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY. HEY, KA'IULANI! - I'M NOT GOING! HEY, STOP THAT! COME ON, STOP IT! FOR GOD'S SAKE, GIRL, YOU'LL DROWN! I HATE YOU! I WISH IT WAS YOU THAT DIED. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. I AM ALI'I. AND I AM YOUR FATHER AND I AM NOT PUTTING YOU IN HARM'S WAY, DO YOU HEAR ME? ( sobbing ) YOU'RE TAKING HER AWAY FROM ME AGAIN. YOU WON'T BE HAPPY TILL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT OF HER. NO. NO NO NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE. HEY HEY. WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME GO? THIS IS WHERE SHE IS. NO. BABY GIRL, HEY, MAMA'S WITH GOD NOW. - ( horse whinnies ) - HUP! ( groans ) OH, THANK YOU. - Man: ARCHIE! - AHA! - WELCOME. - YOU'RE A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES, THEO, HEY? COME ALONG, MY DEAR. COME ON. THAT'S IT. THERE WE GO. Theo: WELCOME. OH, YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED. MAKES ME WANT A BLOODY DRINK JUST LOOKING AT YOU. Archie: GIVE ME YOUR HAND, SIR. GIVE ME YOUR HAND. Theo: OH, SIMPLY BREATHTAKING. YOU'VE GROWN SO FAST, YOUR HIGHNESS. KA'IULANI. I'M NOT STAYING HERE. KA'IULANI! THEY'RE NOT OF ROYAL BLOOD. UH, CLIVE THINKS HE'S OF ROYAL BLOOD. COME, YOU MUST BE STARVING. I'VE GOT A POT OF HOT SOUP ON THE STOVE. IT'S JUST THE THING ON THESE COLD MORNINGS. MARK MY WORDS, YOU'LL BE SETTLED IN NO TIME. YOU'VE A PRETTY ROOM, FACING THE LAKE. DEFINITELY A HAWAIIAN PRINCESS. I UNDERSTAND MOST OF HAWAII BELONGS TO YOU THESE DAYS. NOT REALLY. SUGAR PLANTATION HERE AND THERE. OH, THE THOMPSONS SEND THEIR REGARDS. - DO YOU LIKE HER? - NO. WHY NOT? SHE'S PRETTY! SHE THINKS SHE'S BETTER THAN US AND SHE'S NOT. SHE'S JUST SOME PRINCESS OF NOWHERE. - ( growls ) - ( laughing ) Girl: WHAT ARE THESE? THAT ONE'S PRETTY. OLA SHELLS. MY MOTHER AND I COLLECTED THEM FROM THE BEACH. OLA SHELLS. OLA MEANS "LIFE" IN HAWAIIAN. LIFE SHELLS. YOU COLLECT THEM... THEN ATTACH MEMORIES TO EACH ONE SO YOU DON'T EVER FORGET. THIS ONE'S FOR A DAY I SPENT AT THE OCEAN WITH MY MOTHER AND MY AUNTIE LYDIA. SOME AREN'T VERY PRETTY. WHAT'S THAT ONE? WHEN MY MOTHER DIED. AND THOSE ONES? THOSE DON'T HAVE MEMORIES YET. THOSE ARE THE FUTURE. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE A PRINCESS? Archie: KA'IULANI! I'M LEAVING NOW. DO YOU WANT TO SAY GOODBYE? HMM? ( door opens ) YOU'LL GO BY YOUR SURNAME HERE, MISS CLEGHORN. I'VE BEEN TOLD YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED TO CERTAIN... ROYAL PRIVILEGES IN YOUR HOME COUNTRY. WELL, NOT HERE. WE'LL MAKE A RESPECTABLE LADY OF YOU, - AWAY FROM THE BARBARIAN PLACE FROM WHICH YOU'VE COME. - MISS BARNES. HARROWDEN HALL STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN ALL DUTIES, SUCH AS WASHING. YOU'LL EMPTY MY CHAMBER POT AND MAKE MY BED. DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR? PERFECTLY. THE CORRECT RESPONSE IS "I UNDERSTAND, MISS BARNES, MA'AM." I DON'T CARE THAT YOU'RE A PRINCESS, ALL RIGHT? NO ONE HERE DOES. Alice: THE HEADMISTRESS NEEDS YOU, MISS BARNES. KA'IULANI, THERE'S A LETTER FOR YOU. - IT'S FROM-- - KALEHUA! I'LL DO THE LAUNDRY THEN, SHALL I? Girl: MAKE WAY FOR THE WASHING PRINCESS. ( Kalehua speaking Hawaiian ) Schoolgirl: WHAT'S THAT?! - GIVE IT BACK! - IT'S A LOVE LETTER. - WHO'D WRITE HER A LOVE LETTER? - GIVE IT BACK! WHERE ARE YOU FROM? ARE YOU IRISH? PLEASE GIVE IT BACK! GIVE IT BACK! - ( thuds ) - UGLY NEGRO. Barnes: GIRLS! GIRLS! - SHE ATTACKED ME, MISS BARNES. - THAT ISN'T TRUE. - SHE TOOK MY LETTER! - MISS CLEGHORN! GIVE ME THAT. ( paper rustles ) YOU CAN PICK THOSE UP, YOUR HIGHNESS. ( laughing ) ARE YOU GOING INTO TOWN? I AM. UH... COULD YOU BRING ME SOME JOURNALS? I COULD. WELL, WILL YOU? YOU COULD COME WITH ME. BUT I'M NOT DRESSED. ( laughing ) YOU THINK YOU'RE QUITE THE DANDY, DON'T YOU? YOU DO. SALLY MAY SAYS YOU'RE A TERRIBLE KISSER! REALLY? YOU'RE A TERRIBLE LIAR. SALLY MAY WOULDN'T GIVE YOU THE TIME OF DAY, LET ALONE GOSSIP TO A CHILD LIKE YOU. - I'M NOT A CHILD! - HEY! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - YOU COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED, STUPID GIRL. - ( giggles ) ( laughing ) ( door opens ) AH, VICTORIA. ALICE TELLS ME YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL AT SCHOOL. WHAT IS IT? I HAVE NEWS FROM YOUR FATHER. YOUR UNCLE THE KING... HAS DIED. - ( sniffling ) - I AM SO SORRY. HE APPARENTLY HAD BEEN SLIPPING AWAY FOR SOME TIME. I-- I SHOULD... - ALICE IS WAITING FOR ME. - VICTORIA. YOUR AUNT WILL BE QUEEN OF HAWAII NOW - AND YOU-- - I-- I FEEL FLUSHED. Lydia's voice: MY DEAREST KA'IULANI... IT WAS YOUR UNCLE'S WISH AND MY COMMAND THAT YOU BE NAMED HEIR TO THE THRONE. UNTIL SUCH TIME, MY DARLING, I MUST ATTEND TO MY PEOPLE AND FORGET MY SORROW. REMEMBER, KA'IULANI, TO ALWAYS MAKE ROOM FOR THE LIVING. SHALL I LEAVE YOU? FATHER SAYS YOU MAY BE LEAVING US. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO. WHY DOES IT MATTER? YOU'RE OFF TO UNIVERSITY ANYWAY. IT MATTERS. IT MATTERS! YOU HAVE NO IDEA, DO YOU? THE HELL IT'S BEEN LIVING WITH YOU, SEEING YOU EVERY DAY, THE WAY YOU-- SMILE, YOU LAUGH, YOUR PERFUME. - HELL? - YES. AND I KNOW IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME NOW, - BUT YOU JUST MAY VERY WELL LEAVE AND I-- - WHAT? I LOVE YOU. KA'IULANI, I'M... I'M-- I'M HOPELESSLY IN LOVE WITH YOU. ( giggles ) HOPELESSLY? DESPERATELY. IRREPARABLY. COMPLETELY. I'M TALKING ABOUT A LEGITIMATE CONSTITUTION. YOUR HIGHNESS, WE HAVE A CONSTITUTION SIGNED BY THE KING. I DO NOT RECOGNIZE A CONSTITUTION THAT IS UNJUST, - CRAFTED BY THIEVES. - THIEVES, DID YOU SAY? SILENCE, MR. THURSTON! YOU SUCCEEDED IN BENDING MY BROTHER. ME YOU WILL NOT FIND AS PLIABLE. WE ACT FOR THE PEOPLE, YOUR MAJESTY. - THE PEOPLE? - YES. THIS CONSTITUTION WAS PETITIONED BY THE CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY. BY THE PEOPLE, MR. THURSTON. THIS IS THE CONSTITUTION THEY WANT, AS DO I! SIGNED AND ENACTED IMMEDIATELY! AS YOU WISH. - YOUR MAJESTY, I FEEL YOU-- - YOU ARE DISMISSED, MR. DOLE. SEND THIS MESSAGE: "U.S. MINISTER STEVENS, HONOLULU HARBOR. AMERICAN LIVES AND PROPERTY AT RISK." ( clears throat ) ( giggles ) I'VE LOWERED THE TOP BAR SO THAT YOU CAN RIDE IT. BUT IT'S YOURS. - TRY IT! - ( giggles ) COME ON. - THAT'S IT. - ( grunts ) - WHOA WHOA. - OW, MY ANKLE. HAVE A SEAT. THIS ONE? I'M TOLD THIS IS THE MOST SENSITIVE PART OF A WOMAN'S BODY. A WOMAN'S GEOGRAPHY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN HAWAII. IS THAT SO? ( laughs ) AND WHAT IF I ASKED YOU TO MARRY ME? I WOULDN'T KNOW UNTIL YOU ASKED ME. WILL YOU? THAT'S NOT VERY ROMANTIC. VICTORIA KAWEKIU LUNALILO... KALANINUIAHILAPALAPA KA'IULANI... WILL YOU MARRY ME? WHAT IF I HAVE TO GO BACK TO HAWAII THOUGH? OH, I'LL FOLLOW YOU. - I'LL FOLLOW YOU. - REALLY? YES. YES. Alice: YOU'RE IN HERE WORKING YOURSELF UP, AREN'T YOU? DON'T. YOU'LL BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL AT THE PARTY, EASILY. WHICH ONE'S FOR WHEN YOU FIRST KISSED CLIVE? ( classical music playing ) - Man: YOUR GRACE. - GOOD AFTERNOON. HOW DELIGHTFUL TO SEE YOU AGAIN, ELIZABETH. - AFTERNOON. - THEO. - SPLENDID SHOW, DAVID. - HOW WAS YOUR TRIP ABROAD? YOU MUST TELL US ALL ABOUT IT WHEN NEXT WE SEE YOU. THAT DARK COMPLEXION. SHE'S HALF POLYNESIAN AND THE WRONG HALF EDINBURGH SCOTS. - REVEREND GOFF. YOU REMEMBER ALICE? - IS THIS VICTORIA? Duchess: AND CLIVE IS ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH HER? MMM. HAVE A WONDERFUL PARTY. DO YOU THINK SHE'S ATTRACTIVE? ( groans ) IN A JUNGLE TIGRESS SORT OF WAY, I SUPPOSE. - ( Duchess titters ) - DAVID! VICTORIA, I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE DUKE OF WINCHESTER AND HIS NEW WIFE THE DUCHESS. NEW WIFE? WAS THERE ANOTHER? ( faked laughter ) WE WERE JUST ADMIRING YOU FROM ACROSS THE ROOM. DO YOU READ AND WRITE? ( sighs ) IN BOTH HAWAIIAN AND ENGLISH, DAVID. - HMM. - HAWAII HAS THE HIGHEST LITERACY RATE IN THE WORLD. Duchess: YOUR GOWN IS LOVELY. YOU COULD ALMOST PASS AS ONE OF OUR ROYALS. THE PRINCESS'S FAMILY LINE DATES BACK 1500 YEARS. HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD YOUR TITLE, ELIZABETH, A MONTH? EXCUSE US. IT IS A PLEASURE TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE. Alice: I AM SORRY, ELIZABETH. HONESTY DOES ALWAYS GET THE BETTER OF HIM. WHOA. ( door opens ) LOOK AT ME. I'M A MESS. FORGET THEM. THEY'RE POMPOUS FOOLS. - I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK. - GOOD. - I DON'T. - GOOD. IT JUST BOTHERS ME TO SIT HERE... LIKE SOME ORNAMENT. MORE NEWS? IT'S FROM KALEHUA. DO YOU WANT TO GO HOME? Theo: AH, CLIVE, MAY WE HAVE A WORD? IN PRIVATE? IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US, VICTORIA? ( whispers ) I LOVE YOU. Theo: THANK YOU. IF THIS IS ABOUT THE DUKE AND THE DUCHESS, I'M SORRY-- YOU AND VICTORIA. YES, I'VE PROPOSED. - SHE'S ACCEPTED. - Mother: GOOD. WE THOUGHT SO. IF YOU WANT HER TO STAY, IF YOU WANT TO MARRY HER, SHE MUSTN'T SEE THIS. Soldier: MOVE MOVE MOVE! - GO GO GO GO GO! - OVER HERE. THIS WAY! ( horse neighs ) THIS WAY, STAND YOUR GROUND! HAS WASHINGTON APPROVED? WELL, DEMOCRACY IS AMERICAN. Soldier: TAKE THE PALACE. SURRENDER ALL YOUR WEAPONS. GIVE ME THAT! ( thunder rumbling ) Maid: MA'AM? MRS. CONNELLY, THE SEAMSTRESS. - MISS BARNES. - MA'AM. RECENTLY WIDOWED. LOOKING FOR WORK, MA'AM. BRING TOWELS. - QUICKLY! - Alice: BUT SHE WAS SO-- ALICE! YOUR CLOAK LOOKS VERY DAMP, MRS. CONNELLY. MAY I? PLEASE. I'M JUST NOT SURE IF HE'S THE WISEST CHOICE AT THIS MOMENT! WHO ARE YOU TO SAY WHAT I CAN DO? I AM STILL YOUR FATHER, YOUNG LADY. YOU LOST THAT PRIVILEGE TWO YEARS AGO WHEN YOU ABANDONED ME! OH! WHY ARE YOU HERE?! HAVEN'T YOU READ ANY OF MY TELEGRAMS? WHAT TELEGRAMS?! STAY THERE! WHERE ARE THEY? WHERE ARE THEY? "MONARCHY OVERTHROWN." "HOUSE ARREST." "NOTIFY THE PRINCESS." WHY? - WHY? - VICTORIA? YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED. DID YOU KNOW?! THESE! DID YOU KNOW? ( sighs ) I DID. AM I THAT WEAK IN YOUR EYES? NO, I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD WAIT. - UNTIL WE WERE MARRIED. - AND I'M JUST TO FOLLOW IN YOUR PURSUITS? NO. I LOVE YOU. YOU'VE SAID THAT. Theo: VICTORIA. THERE IS NO VICTORIA. THERE NEVER WAS! KA'IULANI. KA'IULANI, WAIT. I MADE A MISTAKE. I'M SORRY. - YOU SAID YOU'D FOLLOW ME IF I HAD TO GO. - I KNOW, AND I WILL. IF IT COMES TO THAT, THEN I WILL FOLLOW YOU. STOP! DO YOU THINK THAT YOU MEAN MORE TO ME THAN MY COUNTRY? DO YOU? ( sobbing ) ( knocks ) Archie: KA'IULANI? I, UM... I HAD CROSS WORDS WITH THEO LAST NIGHT. WHY WOULD HE DO IT? HE HAS HIS OWN INTERESTS TO PROTECT, I SUPPOSE. HE FEELS MISERABLE ABOUT THE WAY THAT THINGS HAVE WORKED OUT BETWEEN YOU AND THE BOY. HE SHOULD. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S THE BEST TIME... THE BOY LOVES YOU. BUT HE LEFT. SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER, DOES IT? TELL ME HOW WE LOST OUR COUNTRY. Archie: DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR UNCLE'S BODYGUARD - FROM ALL THOSE YEARS AGO? - YES. WELL, HE ORGANIZED A REBELLION AFTER DOLE AND THURSTON HAD OVERTHROWN THE GOVERNMENT. AND THE PLAN WAS TO MARCH ON HONOLULU AND FORCE THURSTON'S REGIME TO DISBAND, BUT HIS MEN WERE NOT PREPARED FOR WHAT LAY IN WAIT. IT WAS A MASSACRE FROM THE BEGINNING, I'M AFRAID. ( shouting ) FIRE! ( gunfire ) ( Gatling gun firing ) KALEHUA! - HOW MANY DEAD? - TOO MANY. AND AUNT LYDIA? - ( crockery smashing ) - THE PALACE WAS OVERRUN WITH THIEVES AND WHORES. SHE WAS ARRESTED. SHE WAS DECLARED GUILTY OF TREASON AND SENTENCED TO INDEFINITE HOUSE ARREST WITH FORFEITURE OF HER ASSETS. AND THE TWINS? WELL, I'VE HAD NO NEWS OF EITHER OF THEM. WHAT IF WE WERE TO APPEAL TO THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO WITHHOLD HIS SUPPORT? EVEN IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO SEE HIM, CLEVELAND HASN'T MUCH OF HIS TERM LEFT. - THEN WE WILL ACT QUICKLY. - HMM? DON'T YOU THINK I COULD PERSUADE A PRESIDENT? WELL, YOU ARE YOUR MOTHER'S DAUGHTER, I SUPPOSE. DON'T DISREGARD YOUR HEART. WHY DIDN'T YOU GO AFTER HIM? - PRIDE, I SUPPOSE. - PRIDE, OH? PRIDE CAN KEEP YOU FROM MANY A GOOD THING. WOULD YOU, UM... WOULD YOU HAVE A READ OF THIS, PLEASE? WHAT IS IT? AH, THEO WROTE IT FOR YOU. IT'S HIS WAY OF MAKING AMENDS, I SUPPOSE. THE AMERICAN PRESS WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU. THEY KNOW WE'RE COMING? OH, YES YES. THURSTON MADE SURE OF IT. HE POSTED A SOMEWHAT INFLAMMATORY LETTER IN THE MAIN NEW YORK JOURNAL. WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED? THIS NEEDS REVISIONS. WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED? - I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. - THERE SHE IS. EXCUSE ME, COMING THROUGH. - THINK SHE'LL BE BAREFOOT? - MORE THAN LIKELY. WAIT HERE, MA'AM. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT MY DAUGHTER PRINCESS KA'IULANI OF HAWAII. Woman: SHE'S PRETTY. - UNDENIABLY ELEGANT. - SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. ( softly ) UNBIDDEN, - I STAND ON YOUR SHORES TODAY. - WHAT?! - WHAT? WHAT? - CAN'T HEAR IN THE BACK. - WHAT IS SHE SAYING? - LOUDER! - I COME UNATTENDED EXCEPT FOR THE LOVING HEARTS... - CAN'T HEAR YOU IN THE BACK. - SPEAK UP, GIRLIE! - SPEAK ENGLISH? LOUDER! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? ( wavering ) I HEAR THAT COMMISSIONERS FROM MY LAND HAVE BEEN ASKING THIS GREAT NATION TO TAKE AWAY MY LITTLE VINEYARD. - WHAT DID SHE SAY? - THEY SPEAK NO WORD TO ME - AND LEAVE ME TO FIND OUT... - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! MA'AM, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY? NOTHING. SHE'S JUST A GIRL. GET ON WITH IT. ( woman laughs ) - 70 YEARS AGO... - WHAT? ...CHRISTIAN AMERICA SENT MEN AND WOMEN TO GIVE RELIGION TO HAWAII. TODAY THREE SONS OF THOSE MISSIONARIES ARE APPEALING TO YOUR CAPITOL TO UNDO THEIR FATHERS' WORK. I, A YOUNG INEXPERIENCED GIRL, WITH NOT ONE OF MY PEOPLE NEAR ME AND ALL OF THESE STATESMEN AGAINST ME, HAVE CHOSEN TO STAND UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF MY PEOPLE. EVEN NOW I HEAR THEIR WAILING IN MY HEART AND IT GIVES ME THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE. AND I AM STRONG IN THE FAITH OF GOD, STRONG IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I AM RIGHT, STRONG IN THE STRENGTH OF 70 MILLION PEOPLE WHO IN THIS FREE LAND WILL HEAR MY CRY AND REFUSE TO LET THEIR FLAG HIDE DISHONOR TO MINE! - BRAVO! - Woman: GOOD FOR YOU. - WELL SAID. - ( applause ) THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS? - YES YES! OVER HERE! - YES YES, YOU, SIR. - YOU, SIR, YES. - PRINCESS KA'IULANI, WILL YOU BE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT? I'M IN THE UNITED STATES AS A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL WITH NO INVITATION TO THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT WITH YOUR HELP, I HOPE TO CHANGE THAT. - HERE HERE HERE! - BUT YOU CAN CALL ON HIM ANY TIME INFORMALLY. I COULD NOT DO THAT. ONE WOULD NOT CALL ON A GENTLEMAN WITH WHOM THEY ARE NOT ACQUAINTED, INFORMALLY. AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE PUBLIC STATION OF PRESIDENT CLEVELAND MAKES A DIFFERENCE. HOW LONG WILL YOU WAIT THEN FOR AN INVITATION? AS LONG AS IT TAKES. AND IF HE WON'T MEET WITH YOU? THEN I SHALL BE HERE A VERY LONG TIME. ( reporters chuckle ) THAT'S ALL FOR THIS AFTERNOON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. I THINK THE VERY FLOWER OF CIVILIZATION. HER ACCENT SAYS LONDON, HER FIGURE NEW YORK, - BUT HER HEART SAYS HAWAII. - NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED. NOT EVEN A HEMI-SEMI-DEMI BARBARIAN. ( mutters ) - CHRISTIAN! - ( paper tears ) SET THIS TO PRINT IMMEDIATELY. AND THE HEADLINE? "THE PRINCESS WHO... IMAGINES SHE'S QUEEN." ( hoofbeats, carriage rattling ) I CAME TO AMERICA TO MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT, NOT TO SHARE A HOT DOG WITH THE FIRST LADY. BUT YOU'RE NOT A STATESMAN. - HMM? - SO I'M TO HAVE A LUNCHEON-- YES YES. UNDER THE GUISE OF HAVING A LUNCHEON WE COULD MEET THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN AMERICA. YOU HAVE TO WALK A FINE LINE HERE, KA'IULANI. Woman: YOUR NAME IS BEAUTIFUL. AND SO ARE YOU, MY DEAR. MUCH FAIRER IN PERSON THAN IN THE PAPERS. THANK YOU. GROVER WAS ADAMANT THAT YOU JOIN US. OH, SPEAKING OF THE DEVIL. Cleveland: A STROKE OF GOOD FORTUNE. MY MEETING WAS CANCELED. I'M AVAILABLE FOR LUNCH. THE MAN CAN ALWAYS EAT. I KNOW YOU WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER, GROVER. ANYTHING I CAN BRING YOU, MA'AM? CUMIN, PLEASE? YOUR HIGHNESS, IT'S BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE YOUR STAY HERE. THE PRESS ABSOLUTELY LOVES YOU. THERE ARE SENATORS ON CAPITOL HILL THAT WIELD LESS POWER OVER THE PRESS THAN YOU SEEM TO. Archie: HER HIGHNESS UNDERSTANDS THAT - SHE'S NOT HERE ON STATE BUSINESS. - THANK YOU. WHAT MY FATHER IS SAYING IS THAT I'M GRATEFUL TO BE A GUEST AND WOULD NEVER PRESUME TO TALK ABOUT THE POLITICS OF HAWAII. WHICH REMINDS ME OF THIS HEN. Grover: THE HEN REMINDS YOU OF HAWAII? ( chuckles ) IT DOES, ACTUALLY. NATURAL, UNSPOILED, PERFECT. FOR AS LONG AS ANYONE CAN REMEMBER, PEPPER HAS BEEN THE PERFECT SEASONING FOR HEN. LATELY THOUGH, SALT, A WHITE MINERAL FROM THE SEA, HAS BEEN THE FASHION. CAREFUL TO ADD JUST A BIT, AS A PERFECT BALANCE CAN BE EASILY UPSET. SHOULD YOU INTRODUCE AN AMERICAN SPICE, SUCH AS CUMIN... THE SALT IS FORTIFIED, THE HEN DESTROYED. MR. PRESIDENT, IF YOU PLEASE. ( squawks ) IT'S TERRIBLE. TELL ME, HOW DO WE RESTORE THE NATURAL FLAVOR? CUMIN HAS NO PLACE ON HEN. WELL, PRINCESS, I ONLY HAVE FOUR WEEKS LEFT IN OFFICE, BUT I PROMISE TO DO WHAT I CAN TO HALT THE USE OF... CUMIN. YOU'LL NEED TO GET YOUR SPICES IN ORDER QUICKLY, YOUNG LADY. PRESIDENT-ELECT McKINLEY IS FROM OHIO AND, AS FAR AS I KNOW, NOT A VERY GOOD COOK. Thurston: GENTLEMEN, SHE MAY HAVE SUCCEEDED IN WINNING OVER CLEVELAND, BUT THE NEW PRESIDENT DOESN'T SHARE HIS VIEWS. McKINLEY IS WISE TO THE RICHES OF THIS COUNTRY, AND WHAT WE CAN DO FOR HIS. AND HE UNDERSTANDS THAT WHOEVER POSSESSES HAWAII CONTROLS THE PACIFIC. SO HER PLAN HAS FAILED. WHAT SHE'S DONE IS AN ACT OF TREASON - AND WE WILL NOT STAND FOR IT! - Man: THAT'S RIGHT! IF SHE DOES RETURN, I PROPOSE THAT SHE IS IMMEDIATELY INCARCERATED. Dole: WHAT POSSIBLE GOOD COULD THAT DO? SHE'S OF LITTLE RELEVANCE TO YOU NOW. THE UNITED STATES IS ON YOUR SIDE. OUR SIDE... DON'T YOU MEAN, JUSTICE? YES. YES, I... OF COURSE. WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT TO IMPRISON THE PRINCESS WOULD ONLY CREATE MORE TENSION BETWEEN SIDES. THERE IS ONLY ONE SIDE, SANFORD-- OURS. IT'S INTERESTING YOU HAVEN'T REALIZED THAT YET. - ( ships horn blares ) - ARE WE THERE YET? ( soldiers shout in distance ) Soldier: ALL RIGHT, BOYS. - COME ON! - OVER HERE. THANK YOU. I HAVE ORDERS TO ESCORT YOU TO THE QUEEN'S RESIDENCE, PRINCESS. PLEASE. ( soldiers shouting in distance ) KA'IULANI? I HARDLY RECOGNIZE YOU. YOU HAVE BECOME A WOMAN. SO BEAUTIFUL. YOUR COUNTRY HAS MISSED YOU, KA'IULANI. I AM SO HAPPY YOU'VE COME BACK. WHAT HAPPENED? THE UNITED STATES SUPPORTS THE ANTIROYALISTS. IT IS CLEAR TO ME NOW THAT THEY ALWAYS INTENDED TO DO SO. WE ARE BEING ANNEXED, OUR SOVEREIGNTY STOLEN. THE KANAKA SIGNED A PETITION... WHICH WAS IGNORED. WE HAVE BEEN SILENCED. I'M SO SORRY. IT WAS A VERY NOBLE THING YOU DID, MY CHILD. UNFORTUNATELY, YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT THE SADDEST POSSIBLE TIME. THE ANNEXATION CEREMONY IS TOMORROW. I WON'T ATTEND. I'M HOSTING A PRIVATE FUNCTION, A KIND OF FUNERAL FOR OUR NATION. A WISE WOMAN ONCE SAID... "WE MUST ALWAYS MAKE ROOM FOR THE LIVING." AND WE WILL. Clive's voice: MY DEAR KA'IULANI... PLEASE UNDERSTAND MY REASONS FOR LEAVING YOU. ( waves lapping ) I BELIEVE YOU'LL FIND IT EASIER TO GO HOME WITHOUT ME. I ACTED FOOLISHLY, AND FOR THAT I AM TRULY SORRY. BUT PLEASE, I BEG YOU, DO NOT FORGET US. OUR LOVE DESERVES TO BE GUARDED. I PRAY THAT TIME WILL BRING US TOGETHER AGAIN. REMAIN COURAGEOUS, MY BELOVED PRINCESS. NO ONE CAN RESIST YOU, CERTAINLY NOT I. YOUR LOVING CLIVE. THE NIGHT MY COUNTRY DISAPPEARED. Official: DO YOU SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO GOD AND COUNTRY? Dole: I DO. ( brass band playing "The Star Spangled Banner" ) ( band going progressively out of tune ) ( girl speaks Hawaiian ) WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? MAY I HAVE A WORD, YOUR HIGHNESS? I APPRECIATE YOUR SEEING ME, YOUR HIGHNESS. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE EMOTIONS THAT YOU ARE FEELING TODAY. NOW THAT HAWAII IS U.S. TERRITORY THERE MUST BE NEW LAWS. TO THAT END, THREE U.S. COMMISSIONERS ARE ARRIVING TODAY TO ASSIST ME. LORRIN THURSTON AND I WERE WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT... IF YOU COULD POSSIBLY FIND IT IN YOURSELF TO HOST A DINNER FOR THESE COMMISSIONERS? I UNDERSTAND. YOUR HIGHNESS, THESE COMMISSIONERS WILL PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE FUTURE OF HAWAII. THEIR KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED TO WHAT THURSTON HAS TOLD THEM. JUST BE A GOOD HOSTESS, SHOW THEM OUR SOLIDARITY. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT EVENING FOR US. IT COULD BE FOR YOU, AS WELL. Barbershop quartet: * LATE ONE NIGHT WHEN WE WERE ALL IN BED * - * OLD MOTHER LEARY LEFT THE LANTERN IN THE SHED... * - THANK YOU. * WHEN THE COW KICKED OVER * SHE WINKED HER EYE AND SAID, "THERE'LL BE A HOT TIME * * IN THE OLD TOWN TONIGHT"... * Man: GOOD EVENING, YOUR HIGHNESS. Man: YOUR HIGHNESS. PRINCESS. - YOUR HIGHNESS. - EVENING. YOU ARE DOING YOUR PEOPLE A GREAT SERVICE TONIGHT, PRINCESS. EVENING. I HOPE SO, MR. THURSTON. YOUR HIGHNESS. GOOD EVENING, SIR. ( guests chattering ) ONE MORE? - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. - ( clinks flatware ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M SO PLEASED TO SEE EVERYONE ENJOYING THEMSELVES. DON'T BE AFRAID TO TRY THE POI. IT'S REALLY QUITE DELICIOUS. I HAVE THE DISTINGUISHED HONOR THIS EVENING TO INTRODUCE YOUR HOSTESS, THE LOVELY PRINCESS KA'IULANI. - ( applause ) - Men: HEAR HEAR! THANK YOU. I HOPE EVERYONE ENJOYED THE LOCAL FOOD THIS EVENING. THE HAGGIS, OF COURSE, IS NOT HAWAIIAN, BUT RATHER A REMINDER TO MY FATHER TO STAY AWAY FROM THE KITCHEN STAFF. HAWAII IS ABOUT TO ENTER INTO THE 20th CENTURY A CHANGED NATION. THIS EVENING, I OFFER THAT WE EMBARK ON THIS TRANSITION - AS FRIENDS. - HEAR HEAR! WELL SAID. MR. THURSTON AND MR. DOLE WANTED A POPULAR GOVERNMENT. WELL, IT HAS ARRIVED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? ASK MR. THURSTON AND HE WILL TELL YOU THAT IF YOU OWN LAND YOU CAN VOTE. CONVENIENTLY, THE NATIVES DO NOT OWN LAND. IF YOU ASK ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS FROM WASHINGTON-- ALL PRESENT THIS EVENING-- THEY WILL TELL YOU WITH GREAT PRIDE THAT ANY AMERICAN MALE WHO CAN READ OR WRITE CAN VOTE. ANY ANGLO-AMERICAN... OF COURSE. AS TO THE OTHERS, ONE DAY THEY TOO WILL BE READY TO GOVERN. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. BUT, REGRETTABLY, THAT IS NOT TODAY. ON THE CONTRARY. YOU WILL FIND THE KANAKA ARE VERY EAGER TO HAVE A HAND IN THEIR OWN GOVERNANCE. MISS CLEGHORN, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING EXACTLY? I'M TALKING ABOUT THE RIGHT TO VOTE. Man: WHAT? I PETITION UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE FOR ALL OUR PEOPLE. Thurston: I BEG YOUR PARDON? SENATORS, WE SIMPLY CANNOT... CONSIDER A PETITION FROM AN ABROGATED HEIRESS. Commissioner: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, MISS CLEGHORN, OUR GOVERNMENT DOESN'T RECOGNIZE YOU AS A STATESMAN. WHO WILL PRESENT YOUR PETITION? - Dole: I WILL. - Crowd: WHAT? HUH? YOUR MAJESTY, YOUR HIGHNESS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I FORMALLY PROPOSE A REVISION TO THE ANNEXATION DOCUMENT. THIS REALLY IS NOT THE TIME OR THE PLACE. SANFORD, PLEASE. Ka'iulani: THE COMMISSIONERS ARE ALL HERE. I CAN'T THINK THINK OF A BETTER TIME. MIGHT I... MIGHT I REMIND YOU THE YOUNG LADY IS NO LONGER A PRINCESS. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. THIS IS ABSURD. HONESTLY, SANFORD... HAVE YOU COMPLETELY LOST YOUR SENSES? OUR FAMILIES DEVELOPED THIS LAND. OUR FAMILIES. AND NOW YOU ALONE ARE PROPOSING TO JUST THROW IT AWAY. Commissioner: THE PRESENCE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THESE ISLANDS MUST BE IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL ITS PEOPLE. - ( crowd agrees ) - ABSOLUTELY. MISS CLEGHORN, HOW MANY NATIVES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? 90% OF ALL OUR PEOPLE. ( murmuring ) I BELIEVE WE ARE COMPELLED TO PRESENT MISS CLEGHORN'S PETITION TO CONGRESS. WELL... WHAT BEGAN AS A LOVELY EVENING HAS REDUCED ITSELF TO MADNESS. I, FOR ONE, TRUST THAT YOU'LL COME TO YOUR SENSES. AS FOR NOW, I BID YOU GOOD EVENING. PUIKI, HELP ME WITH YOUR MOTHER'S CHAIR. - IT'S TIME FOR US TO LEAVE. - LYDIA: STAY. HAVE A SEAT, MR. DOLE. GOOD EVENING. LET HIM BE GONE. ( doors close ) ( sighs ) Dole: I THINK YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN.
