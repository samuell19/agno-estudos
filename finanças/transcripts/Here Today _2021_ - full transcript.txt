[FAUCET CREAKS, THEN WATER RUNNING] [FAUCET CREAKS, THEN WATER STOPS] [WATER SPLASHING GENTLY] [BIKE BELL DINGS] [BIKER] Coming through! Excuse me! Left. Stop sign, left. [GULLS CAWING] One, two, three, four, five. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [DINGS] [INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [GASPS SOFTLY] Mr. Burnz? Are you Charlie Burnz? Charlie Burnz, I'm talking to you. Mr. Burnz, Charlie Burnz. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [MARGE] Sweep up a little bit. Make sure all the props are in the right spot. - Hey, Marge? - Hey, Charlie. Where is everybody? Charlie, it's Monday. They're at the writers' meeting. - Oh, of course... Wow. - [CHUCKLES] - I had a long weekend. - Okay. All right. - Take it easy. - See you later. Better hurry. They're pitching new sketches! Yeah, we made sure to take a lot of care not to offend anybody with this next sketch, so please strap in and, uh, you know, enjoy. Okay, so this is... This is an infomercial for a brand-new comedy album. Uh, we start with shots of planets and stars, just these beautiful shots of space. And then, we hear a VO, and we see a chyron. In the tradition of George Carlin and Richard Pryor, we bring you the next comedy voice. And we cut to a photograph of Stephen Hawking. [ALL LAUGH] But we photoshopped him in front of a brick wall. So he looks like he's at a comedy club. We have a microphone where his computer is. [IN HALTING MONOTONE] Is it just me, but what's the deal with black holes? - Am I right? Ha. Ha. Ha. - [ALL LAUGHING] You people like impressions? [TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING] So how do you think the meeting went? [SIGHS] Some very funny ideas. But, Brad, somebody's got to talk to Roger about his inflections. I know, I know. I think he gets nervous. No, come on. Geo-rge Carlin, Rich-ard Pryor. My God, Stephen Hawking pronounced his name better than he does. Here's one for the new segment. Or as Roger calls it, the new "seg-ment." All right, I'll give this to the guys. There's a new invention called computers. You may wanna get one. You know, I had one, but I like this. We started out together. I love the feel of the paper. I like the fact that the key leaves a mark - that wasn't there a second ago. - Wow. But I did treat myself to one of these. Ooh, look at you. You know how to work it? Absolutely, unless I wanna send an e-mail, a text or make a phone call. - Oh, that's not important. - Not at all. - Wanna get something to eat? - Uh, I have a lunch date. Oh, look at you, Mr. Social. No, it's someone who won an auction to have lunch with me at the charity event - for inner-city libraries. - That sounds like a blast. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [EMMA] This restaurant nice. Excuse me. Oh, no. Heh. Sorry. Bye. Maybe you, sir. Hello. Uh... Oh, Phil Donahue. Nice to meet you. - [MAN] The hell was that about? - [EMMA] Sir, uh, hi. Uh... Oh, no, sorry, sorry to bother you. Wrong person. Excuse me. Bye-bye. Excuse me. Are you, by any chance, looking for me? I'm Charlie Burnz. - You gotta be shitting me. - What? This was you? Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You took some hits along the way, huh? Yeah, you might say that, but that's a very old picture. That was actually taken on the Mayflower. I did win the shuffleboard tournament. Well, belated congratulations. - I'm Emma Payge. - Emma, pleasure. Sit down. - Sorry I'm late. - Don't worry about it. Not a problem. Glad you're here. Thank you for bidding on me at the auction. I'm so flattered that somebody your age would be a fan of my work. - Truth? - Sure. I don't know who the hell you are. My ex bid on you. - You didn't? - Nope. - How did this... - Well, he's an actor, and he was doing a scene from one of your plays in his acting class, and he wanted to meet you, so he bid. - Um, how much? - Twenty-two. - $2200? That's fantastic. - $2200, my ass! Twenty-two dollars. Twenty-two dollars was the winning bid? Mmm-hmm. It started at 20, and then it went up in 50-cent increments. Oh, that's so sad. Heh. Hello. Welcome to Le Monde. I'll be your server. What can I get for you? - Have you eaten here before? - No. They have the greatest steak sandwich. That's all I get. It's fantastic. That's perfect. I'll have the seafood salad. - Okay. And for you, sir? - Um, I'm gonna have the... Oh, can I have extra clams, extra calamari and extra crab meat? - Of course. And for you, sir? - I'm gonna have the... Oh, and can I have a lobster tail right on top, with extra mussels? Lots of mussels. The ones from New Zealand, not from Jersey because they got black hairs. Who knows what's in those? - That can be really toxic. - Are you done? There are a few species you haven't mentioned yet. Heh-heh, go ahead. - I'm gonna have the... - Oh, can I have a Diet Coke? Heh-heh-heh. And for you, sir? I'm gonna have a tuna sandwich, whole wheat toast, - and an iced tea. - Very good. Why would you order a tuna sandwich when you said they had the best steak sandwiches? While you were ordering half of the Atlantic Ocean, I developed a hankering for the only fish left on the menu. Heh. Touche, old man. Touche. - [CHUCKLES] - So let me ask you a question. If you don't know who I am, how come your ex didn't come? - I caught him cheating on me. - Oh! And he said it was because I'm the worst lay in the world. And trust me, he is wrong, okay? You ought to see my moves. It's "Circus do Lay." Okay. Well, let's, uh... Let's get through lunch first. Mmm-hmm. I'd break your back, old man. - Thank you. - Yeah, have you laid out, dead, - with a smile on your face. - [CHUCKLES] And your kids will be like, "How did he die? How did my dad die?" And I would just look at them in their eyes and say, heh, - on top of me. - [COUGHS] That's a really lovely thought. Heh-heh, you funny, old man. I'm glad I came, even if it was to shove you up my ex's big fat ass. Now, there's a compliment you don't hear every day. [CHARLIE] Whoa, look what the tide brought in. - Yeah. - Thank you very much. - [SERVER] Please enjoy. - Uh, Emma, enjoy your buffet. - Mmm-hmm. - So... I take it you like comedy. Nope. - You don't? - Mmm-mmm. I mean, I love to laugh, but in real life. You know what I'm saying? Well, you know, that's what I do in real life. I'm a comedy writer. You ever watch This Just In - on Sunday nights on Funny? - Mmm-mmm. I also, uh, write for Broadway and, um, movies and five books and... And, um, what do you do? Char... Charlie, I don't feel so good. Why is your face suddenly bigger than it was before? I can't feel... I can't feel my lips. Oh, God, are you allergic to seafood? I'll say maybe I am. - What should I do? - Call the hospital. - What? What? - Call the hospital! Call... - Call the... The hospital! - [PHONE CHIMES] Dial the nearest hospital! Dial the nearest hospital! [SIRI] I do not know. Let me check the Web. - Dial the nearest hospital! - Is everything all right? Aah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Okay, what did you do? - I didn't do anything! - These are Jersey mussels! - What? - I knew they were Jersey mussels! - Jersey? No! I'm from Jersey. - I need emergency. Emergency. This is an emergency! [MUMBLING] Everybody, calm down. Everybody, relax. - We should call the ambulance. - Siri! What is wrong with you? Ma'am, have you had an allergic reaction to seafood before? - Mmm-mmm. - You just randomly ordered, - and this is what happened? - I had a hankering. Okay, just try to relax. We're almost there. You're gonna be okay. Charlie? Charlie. Charlie! You're all I've got, Charlie! Please don't leave me! [SIGHS] Oh, boy. Mr. Burnz? Oh, I'm not supposed to fill these out. What's your relation to Miss Payge? She won me in an auction. Fine, don't believe me. She doesn't have insurance, and she really shouldn't be leaving here by herself. No insurance? Okay. Eleven hundred dollars? Yes. And you'll get the ambulance bill in the mail. You can pay me on the way out. Your daughter is going to be fine. My d... Great. Isn't that great? She told me all about how you adopted her from that orphanage in Kenya. - That's very special. - Oh, she told you? - Yeah. - Yeah, well... Ha-ha, well, uh, she is special. Well, this is a pretty severe reaction. Are there other allergies I should know about? I think really you should talk to her about that, or I can put you in touch with one of the elders of her tribe. You could ask for Mbolo. It's good that you reacted as quickly as you did. A little longer, may have been a different story. Here are her prescriptions. Pharmacy is that way. Six hundred dollars? So a tuna sandwich cost me close to two grand. - Welcome to New York, pal. - What's this? That's epinephrine. You need to inject her within the hour. - And if I don't? - She'll die. Next. "Remove blue safety release by pulling up, straight up." - Okay. - What's taking so long? I'm having trouble reading the directions without my glasses. And honestly, I'm a little nervous about it. - Okay. - Oh, no. Hell, no. Put that thing down. Ain't no way in hell I'm gonna let you stab me with that Lego stick while your hand shaking like that. You might put out one of my eyes. They said I have to do it within the hour or you'll be in trouble. We'll just wait an hour. If I'm not dead, you can go home. Fine. Enjoy your bloating. [SIGHS] All right. Stick me, old man. [GROANS] Ow! God... Motherf... Ow! Son of a... - [GRUNTS] - Okay. Show time's over. Make me some tea, maybe it'll help with the bloating... "Only hold in for a few seconds." Ah. "Slippery when wet"? - You looked? - I had to. I really... I had to. That's not something you wanna do with your eyes closed. Believe me. It could have ended up someplace - we both wouldn't be happy about. - [CHUCKLES] Thank you. I promise I will pay you back every dime that you laid out. You don't have to do that. How are you feeling? Like you shot me up with five six-hour energy drinks. So I've got about a good 30 hours of energy! I'm lit! [CHUCKLES] - Can I ask you something? - Yeah. Why did you tell the doctor I was your father? Heh, I thought it would be cool to have a white dad. Oh, and the orphanage story? I was a little loopy by then. I'm sure that was the mussels talking. Yup, those mussels were definitely talking. Yeah, must have been. Well, listen, try to get some rest. Um, do you need anything else? I have 20 bucks left. [CHUCKLES] I'll be fine. Look, I wanna apologize to you for saying all that stuff about my ex. I should have never done that. You are a good man, and that was not fair to you. - Hey, I understand. This way out? - Yep, that way. [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Perky. - Yeah. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] - [CHARLIE] Good try. - [GROANS] Ah! All right, that's... It's all right. It's a base hit. [REX GRUNTING] [GROANS] [CHARLIE] Sorry, Rex. That's a match. I don't know why you play against me. - It's good aerobics. - Yeah, for me. - [CHUCKLES] - I'm running around like crazy. I'm gasping for air. You just... You just stand at the net. Somehow it's six-love, six-love. - Six-love? - Six... - [LAUGHS] - You get perverse pleasure - beating your only son like this? - Yeah, a lot. [GROANS] Listen, Dad, uh... Francine wants to know if you are coming to Lindsay's bat mitzvah. My daughter wants to know if I'm coming to my granddaughter's bat mitzvah? - Why wouldn't I? - She says you never RSVP'd. Why didn't she just call instead of asking you to ask me? Don't be upset. You know how she gets. It'll be a fun day. We'll be together. I don't want Lindsay to think I wasn't gonna come. Who knows what your sister says to her? Just give her a call. This was fun. I'll see you next week? - When I lose to you, again. - [CHUCKLES] I gotta go. I have a 3:00. I'm a little nervous. I'm submitting my design for a new building in Union Square. Well, it could be a big thing for me. I RSVP'd. I know I RSVP'd. Dad, don't worry about that. And wish me luck. About what? For my building, for the design. Oh, oh, oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll see you. I'm gonna call her right now. [GIRL CRYING] Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! I did something wrong, Daddy! I'm scared! Daddy! Daddy! Oh, hi. This is... Craziest thing. I... I forgot what locker I was using. Heh-heh, that's okay. I have a master. Uh... - Let's start with this row. - Okay, good. [LINDSAY SINGING IN HEBREW] That's perfect. You're gonna crush this. - Give me a high-five. - [LAUGHS] I'm proud of you. You're doing so beautifully. Yeah. I'm just getting a little nervous about my speech. - Have you started writing it yet? - Yeah. - Mmm... - [CELL PHONE RINGING] It's your grandfather. - Hi, Papa Charlie. - Hey, Lindsay, honey. How's my favorite bat mitzvah girl? Good. Heh-heh. [QUIETLY] Ask him if he's coming. What do you mean? Grandpa's not coming? - Are you coming? - That's why I'm calling. Of course I'm coming. I wouldn't miss that for the world. Great. I'm so happy. Hey, when you're happy, I'm happy. Um, can I speak to your mom? [WHISPERS] Tell him I can't talk to him right now. Uh... She said she'll call you back. Yeah. Okay. I can't wait to see you. I can't wait to see you too. So tell me. You got a pretty dress? You're gonna have to see when you come. [CHUCKLES] Okay. Um... [SOFTLY] Can you help me with my speech? Yeah, of course. We'll punch it up real good. [CHUCKLES] - Yeah. - Okay, kid. See you soon. [CHARLIE] I had a bad day. Thanks for seeing me so late. I really appreciate it. I, uh... I couldn't remember where my locker was in my health club. I've been going there for years. It was so damn embarrassing. That should be expected. Don't panic. Are you doing what we talked about? Yeah. I try not to vary my routine. I walk the same way to work every day. I eat right. I'm getting some exercise. And, uh, I'm taking my meds. And by the way, that Namenda. Oh, man, it's so constipating. - It... - Sorry about that. Sorry? I was backed up for eight days. I felt like a python that had swallowed a deer. [LAUGHS] Charlie, you have medicines to help with that, and you can always give yourself an enema. I'm saving that for my birthday. A little something special just for me. - How are you sleeping? - [SIGHS] Why sleep when you can stay up and terrorize yourself? Maybe I get four hours, but maybe. And what about those flashbacks? That's the craziest thing. I can forget what I had for lunch while I'm having lunch. But then, something... flies into my head, like, bam! It could be a moment, a fragment, a sentence. And it's like I'm there. Like I can see it like I saw it way back then. It doesn't... It's almost like I can smell things. And then, black. It just goes black, and it goes as fast as it came. It's the craziest thing. - How's the writing going? - I think it helps. Um, it keeps my mind active, and it helps strengthen my denial. You know what, this show, it's all of these young kids. I'm like the old man on the block whose yard you don't wanna hit the ball into. But I still get stuff on the air. I still help shape the show, and when one of my jokes hits right, and the audience laughs, there's still nothing like it. And I still love it. Good. I think you're doing well. We're keeping this at bay, but it's so damn unpredictable. Don't let your denial overrule your sense of reason. There's a lot we still don't know about this kind of dementia. Okay. - See you next month. - Okay. - Unless you need me sooner. - Okay. Thanks, my friend. Oh, by the way, I thought the show last week was pretty good. Was it? Who was on? Um, you know, the guy, what's-his-name? The... From the film. He's married to... Oh! - The one with the hair. - [LAUGHS] Would you like some of my meds? [CLATTERING] [EMMA] You just gonna push the lady down, huh? You just gonna run over somebody! You son of a bitch! Come back here and try that again, you spineless bastard! Hey, hey, hey. What happened? [GROANS] I was going up the right, when I got into a head-on collision with a dumbass who was coming down on the right side, but really that's his left side. And it's all his fault because this isn't England! How did you know where I live? - Oh, Google. - Google? - Here. - What's this? The first installment of the money I owe you. Whoa! You're a pole dancer? God, no. And this coming from a man that makes America laugh for a living. My knee! My fucking knees! Listen, listen, come upstairs. I'll clean you up a little bit, and then we can rinse out your mouth. Come on. [EMMA] Ooh, okay, okay. Jeez. Man, this dude is doing it. This is nice. Ooh! Mmm, he know a lot of old white people. Oprah Winfrey? Hmm! "For Carrie"? - Hmm. - Okay, here we go. According to this wall, not only are you ancient, - but you're also famous. - [CHUCKLES] Sit here. [SIGHS] You a serial killer? What do you mean? Well, isn't that what serial killers do? Collect pictures of everyone they butchered and buried in their backyard? Other knee. - Who are they? - Who? Oh, that's my family. If they're family, why do you have their names written down? I'm writing something about them, and it helps me stay focused. That's all. How did you become a writer? I don't think you become one. I think you just are. When I was a kid, I thought it was fun to take the truth and make it more interesting. So you're a liar? [BOTH CHUCKLE] Nah, I'm just kidding. - That's beautiful. - Yeah. Well, you're as good as new. Thanks. [SIGHS] What was here? Oh, there was just some picture that fell. Housekeeper put it someplace, I don't know. Listen, I gotta get back to work. You gotta get back to making up shit because your real life is boring? Something like that, yeah. Thanks for bringing me the bag of laundered money. The Corleones will be very pleased. Um... But you really didn't have to do that. That's where you're wrong, old man. I did. Mwah! Bye-bye. Next is Sarah and Roger, Paula and Gary wrote this. A cheesy ad for a law firm. Hello, I'm Jerry Loomis. And I'm Lorraine Loomis. When we got married, the rules of dating were much less confusing than they are today. - And that's where we come in. - We're the Sex Refs. [ALL LAUGH] We go on your dates with you. [BOTH] Maintaining a safe distance. - So if there's any hanky... - Or panky. We're there to help clarify what both parties' intentions are. So there's no misunderstandings that could lead to accusations and lawsuits. We deal with the he said-she said aspects - of miscommunication. - For example, you're in a parked car and she says, "Would you like to kiss me?" But he said she said, "Honey, can you please stick your thumb up my ass?" [ALL LAUGHING] Very different, isn't it? [BOTH] We think so. Or if you're at the top of the Ferris wheel, and he says, "I really don't like heights." But she says he said, "Wanna see a picture of my Rottweiler's balls?" [ALL LAUGHING] Now you see why you need us? We'll be there to protect you from vicious accusations, subpoenas and defamation suits. - [WHISPERS] Sub-poena? - Remember we're on your side. [BOTH] No matter what side that is. - [ROGER] We're Loomis. - And Loomis. And we'll see you in court... [BOTH] Ship. [ALL LAUGH] [MAN] That's good. That was good. - Well, it's subtle. - [ALL CHUCKLE] So... Okay, good job. Next sketch is from Darrell. Thomas Crapper Jr. We open on a 19th century British schoolyard. A group of 9-year-old children are milling about and trying to figure out what they want to do - now that school is let out. - Wanna come over to my house? No. Your house smells. How about my house? No. Your house smells too. My house doesn't smell. How come? I'm Thomas Crapper Jr. My father invented the flush toilet. [ALL] Then let's go over to his house. All right, all right. All right, guys. Very funny stuff. Let's put together a show. Sex Refs. Ah. You guys wrote a really funny sketch. But, uh... But what? Sarah and Roger were hilarious. - [GARY] Correct. - I don't know. I don't know. - Charlie, what do you think? - Very funny idea. But a thumb up the ass, Rottweiler's balls... What are you talking about? They got laughs. Of course they will. They always will. But is it the right kind of laugh? Because it's a very smart idea. Angry Librarians? - So funny. - You should do it. I agree. - Thomas Crapper Jr. - Hell, no. Yeah. You know, Darrell's option's coming up, and he still hasn't gotten a sketch on the air. It's not that bad. First of all, if they spoke in English accents, the way they were supposed to, it would've been a little bit better, but the whole thing's not framed right. Give him another shot. He'll make it better. Listen, we hired Darrell because he wrote those really funny essays for the Lampoon. I think it's a little hard to make the leap from print to live sketches. It takes time. You think he's a good writer? Yeah. I think... I think it's in there. But I think it needs to be encouraged. Listen, you guys are a very fast crowd to run with, and I also think that Inflection Mangler Roger should be hit in the head until he says "subpoena" right. I mean, come on. "Sub-poena," what is that? A very small poena? That's an inferior poena. An underground poena? I mean, what is his problem? You know, but here's the thing. There's a music to comedy. There's a music. There are notes to comedy. - He's out of tune. - We're working on it. Keep working, because it's driving me nuts. - All right. What's next? - Uh, I have to go. - I'm sorry, I have my... - Oh, oh! - Excuse me. - Oh, right. - Yeah. - Have a great time. - Thanks. - Oh. I wish I could go. - Hey. You got a job. Ha-ha! - Yeah. All right. - [CHARLIE] Good night. - Good night. Good night. They're, um... They're honoring Charlie and the whole cast at the American Film Society for the 30th anniversary of Call Me Anytime. Kevin Kline, Sharon Stone, Barry Levinson directing. Oh. Such a funny movie. Have you seen it? - Mmm-hmm. - Yeah. It's great. All right. What's up? Look, you know I love Charlie. I know he gave you your start and everything. But... come on. Yeah, I just don't know what he brings to the show anymore. Aside from 40 years' experience? And a body of work that includes shows that made it possible for this show to exist? [SIGHS] Look, I know how you can question Charlie's value. But he's really smart and he still writes funny jokes. And he's my consigliere. So when you write sketches with a thumb up someone's ass, or a Rottweiler's balls, he's the one who reminds me what we should be putting on the air. Bottom line, as long as I am producing this show, Charlie will be here. - Okay? - You got it. - All right. - Yeah. - Let's get back to work. - Yeah. [ALL CHATTERING] [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Come on, come on. Close the door, close the door. Turn off the lights. Come here. [BOTH MOANING] I can't do this anymore. - Why? - Oh! You're married, I'm married. I don't want anyone to get hurt. Well, neither do I. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Mmm, I just don't know what to do. But wait, wait, wait. Let's make a plan. Every year, we will meet here in the Tuckmans' bathroom, at their Halloween party. What about the Tuckmans' Christmas party? No, we've got to be strong. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] [AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING] Hi, how are you? Thank you all for being here. Good evening, I'm Bob Costas. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] Please welcome the director of Call Me Anytime, Barry Levinson. Its writer, Charlie Burnz, and its stars, Kevin Kline and Sharon Stone. [ALL WHOOPING, WHISTLING] I have to say, right off the top. I really love this film. In fact, I'm bypassing a Mets-Astros game tonight just to be here, to do this instead. All right, so, what's the germ of all this? How did it all get started? Well, um, Charlie and I originally met on The Carol Burnett Show ages ago. And, uh, he wrote a lot of very funny sketches. Shy guy, uh, always called me Mr. Levinson. - Even though we were friendly. - [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] All right, so, what happened was, um, I read Charlie's script and, uh, I thought, "Well, this is a perfect film to do." So the next day, I get a call from Barry, and he says, "I just read this script, it's terrific. You gotta read it. The character, she's you." And I said, "She's completely compulsive, she'll do anything. I'm in." [ALL LAUGHING] And then the next day, he called me. I read the script and then I was in. Literally three days later, we got a go. And I called Charlie with the good news. And so, Charlie, you get the call, what did Barry say? - Who? - Heh, Mr. Levinson. Oh, heh. It's so nice to see you. Nice to... Wow. It's great to meet you. Well, I was... I was just thrilled and shocked that, um... Mr. Levinson. [ALL LAUGHING] Uh... [CHUCKLES] Wanted to direct my first... - This was my first screenplay. - Yes. And that Kevin Kline was gonna play Ben, and that... Help me. - Meryl Streep. - Hello. Heh, was, uh, gonna play Iris. And I kept thinking, if my parents were alive, this good news would've killed them. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [BARRY] Charlie's work is... It's not just comedic, there's a humanity to it. And I think it shows people as real people. He's an exceptional writer. Hey, old man. You were great up there. Hey. You were inside? Yeah. And I loved it. Second installment. It's a little light, boss. Please don't break my thumbs. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Well, this is a... This is a lovely surprise. - How'd you know about this? - My loser ex. I used his ticket. You made me laugh a lot. I'm really sorry. [BOTH LAUGH] No, I liked seeing you up there. It was so cool. And you've done a lot of big things. - I got lucky. - Being good ain't got nothing to do with luck. I guess. Why do you have birds in your hair? Why not? Oh, shit, what time is it? Damn! I'm gonna be late for work. - I gotta go. Come with me. - Work? - Yeah. Come on. - Now? - Yeah. - What do you do?

[BOTH CHUCKLE] We used to have a lot of fun. They taught me how to harmonize, and my dad made these really cool weathervanes. And my mom, she had these beautiful dreamcatchers that she makes. They live just outside of Charlotte. I love them both to pieces. Oh, they sound great. I love the way the air smells after it rains. Hmm. Listen, if you ever need my help with what you're going through right now, even if you need someone to talk to, I'm here. Well, thank you very much. But what are you talking about? You forgot Sharon Stone and Barry Levinson's names? Oh, that. I get a little tongue-tied. - I don't like being on-stage. - And what stage were you on when you wrote your family's names under their pictures? I told you, that's how I work. It's a project that I'm working on, and... Look, I know what you told me, but don't bullshit me, old man. It started innocently enough. I'd have trouble remembering things. A name, a place, a fork. And I'd think, "You're getting older, Charlie. You know, you're having senior moments." But one day, I'm having lunch with this guy, and I can't remember his name. He's going on and on and on. I'm thinking, "Who the hell is this?" Then he cracks himself up and he starts laughing. So I faked laughing. Just to go along with him. And while I'm laughing, I'm panicking. Thinking, "Who the hell is this?" Did you know him? He was my son. [GROANS SOFTLY] Yeah. It's happening. Jesus, old man. I'm sorry. [SIGHS] Who's Carrie? I saw that on the title page at your house. Carrie was my wife. She died. A long time ago. And I'm writing something for her. And I have to finish before my words run out. When did you start working on it? About an hour after I was diagnosed. And how's it going so far? It's going really well. My mama would call that a crock of lukewarm horseshit. Don't lie to me, old man. I know you haven't started writing one single word. - Let me see your phone. - My phone? - Your phone. - Okay. Okay. This is my name, this is my number, okay? Now, even if you don't wanna contact me, I just want you to know that I'm not some allergic-to-shellfish nut that's half your age plus four, that wants to help you because you helped me. You don't stop for commas, do you? Life's too short for commas. Darrell, um, this is better. Try this as a tag. Let's do it in the dress rehearsal. What do you think? [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Yeah, that's great. - Are we good? - Yeah. Thanks. - Good. Alrighty. - All right. [IN ENGLISH ACCENT] Want to come to my house and play? [IN ENGLISH ACCENT] No, your house smells. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] [IN ENGLISH ACCENT] Come to my house and play. [SARAH] No, your house smells too. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] My house doesn't smell. We can play there. Oh, he's Thomas Crapper's son. His father invented the flushing toilet. That's a lot of crap. - Not anymore. - [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] [ALL] Let's go to his house! [IMITATING JEFF GOLDBLUM] Ah, yes. Thomas Crapper, the, uh, father of the modern toilet. I'm Jeff Goldblum. - Uh... Oh, heh-heh-heh. - [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] [PURRS] This has been a little-known moment in indoor plumbing history. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Change your toilet. Change the world. Commercial break! Two minutes. Wow. - Not bad. - Great fix, Darrell. Yeah, the Goldblum thing was funny. - Thanks. - I think we'll slot it after the third commercial break. Got one on the air. [GARY] All right, so... [GARY CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] [BRAD] Yeah. Yeah. [SIGHS] [CELL PHONE CHIMES] [EMMA] How did you meet Carrie? [CELL PHONE CHIMES] Come on, old man. How did you two meet? [CARRIE] Damn it, I hate this stuff. [CHARLIE] Hey, you know what really does the trick? What? [CHARLIE] Butter. - Did you just say butter? - I'm telling you. Butter. No, really. There's a lot of tar on the beach this year. What you do is you take a stick of butter and just keep rubbing it into the tar and somehow it breaks it down, you can just wipe it away and you don't have to use that tomahawk of a shell, which is probably taking off all the epidermis - on the bottom of your foot. - [CHUCKLES] - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Charlie Burnz. - Hello, Charlie Burnz. - I'm Carrie. - Carrie? Is that short for Caren or Carina or a Catherine or... - Florence. - Florence? Don't ask. Florence. Well, that's a great old-fashioned name. That's one of the names of one of my relatives. I could never imagine my relatives as babies. Herman, come away from the water. Irving, don't put that puppy in your mouth. Ooh, Mildred just pooped in the toilet. A big hand for Mildred. - [LAUGHING] - You don't hear those names. That's true. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Listen, I live in that white house, like, right over there, and I happen to have like half a ton of butter. So if you... Yeah, I won a dairy contest. You had to guess how much the cow weighed. - [CHUCKLES] - And, uh, I can de-tar you. And I mean that in a very respectful way. Okay. [CHARLIE] Wow, is that a paint-by-number? Oh, it's you again. Hello, Charlie Burnz. Hey, Carrie. It's really good. - Yeah? You like it? - Yeah. - You know what else I like? - What? - Steamed clams. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - I've never had steamed clams. Okay, my house, 7:00 p.m. Deal. [CHARLIE] Here we go. Okay, take the clam. Spread it apart. Rinse him in the broth. And then to the butter. And then to your mouth. It's a little bit of heaven. Isn't it great? Oh. Oh, God. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Oh, God, that's disgusting. - [LAUGHING] - Please don't sue. Oh, man. - Pizza? - I'll call Gino's. [CHARLIE] I just got this rug. This is like tracking Bigfoot. [CHARLIE CHUCKLES] Hey. Hey. Carrie. Good morning. Here. Good morning, Charlie Burnz. [CHARLIE CHUCKLES] Here. A little something for breakfast. It's a beautiful day. - Ha-ha! Oh, God. - [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] Okay. De-tar me. But it seems a shame to waste the butter on my foot. - Oh! - Come here. Okay. [CHARLIE WHISPERING] Hi.

You sounded great. - What are you doing here? - Em, I'm sorry. I messed up. Please. It's too late. I've moved on. I met someone and we're in love. What?

Okay with you, sir? - Sure. - Man, this is amazing. - I'll take it. I know the password already. All right, get closer. Okay, now, smile. Put your hands up in the air. Yeah, like you won something. - Aah! Ha-ha! - Mmm-hmm. There you go. Okay. Charlie, come over here. Is this good enough? [LAUGHS] Now you'll always remember what me and your idol look like together. Bye-bye. [SIGHS] - You okay? - I will be. - I want some ice cream. - Okay. [SERVER] And a triple vegan delight. Wow, that looks like the Olympic torch. [SERVER LAUGHING] Hey, I gotta change the name. So when would you leave? In like a month or so. It's crazy how things happened. This record producer saw our videos and... he was digging us, next thing you know, bam! We going on tour for four months, on a tour bus, and we're already talking about doing an album, it's... Charlie, I'm sorry. I'm doing all the talking. You said something good happened? - I wrote last night. - You did? That's awesome. It was fantastic. Just like the old days. Itzhak Perlman starting playing, and I started writing. Izzy Perlman? Who's Izzy Perlman? Not Izzy Perlman. Izzy Pearlman sold my parents Venetian blinds. Itzhak Perlman is one of the greatest violinists in the world. Ask your phone who he is! He lives in the building behind me and he likes to practice at night. I just open my window and it's like a free Itzhak festival. It's one of the reasons Carrie and I bought the place. Ooh! What was that for? I don't think I would've written anything if you didn't get me started. - You're welcome. - Thank you. Tink. [CHUCKLES] Hey, um... Are you doing anything right now? - No. - It's my day off. Wanna have some laughs? - Hell, yeah. - Come on. - [EMMA] Wax museum? - [CHARLIE] Trust me, it's fun. [EMMA] Don't tell me there's one of you here. - [CHARLIE] Come on. - [EMMA] Heh, okay. This is Marilyn Monroe from The Seven Year Itch. Mmm. I'd be itchy too if I had hot subway air blowing up my ass. Is that who I think it is? - [EMMA] Hello, Dalai. - [CHARLIE LAUGHS] Come on, queen. Smile, girl. Smile. [CHARLIE] What could he possibly be thinking? "Shouldn't have had the seafood salad." [LAUGHS] - [CHARLIE] Picasso. - [EMMA] I don't dig him. - [CHARLIE] Why? - Sexist. If I did a painting of you with three willies, would you be happy? - [CHARLIE] I'd be ecstatic. - [EMMA LAUGHS] [CHARLIE IN GERMAN ACCENT] The Theory of Relativity is never lend your relatives money. You can kiss that ten bucks goodbye. [LAUGHS] [CHARLIE IN GRAVELLY VOICE] Golda, tell me again. I don't understand. [EMMA IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] Okay, Mr. Arafat. It's "Chanukah," not "Hanukkah." [CHARLIE] I'm having trouble with the "hucch." I'm having trouble with the "hucch"! [CHARLIE IN NORMAL VOICE] Pope? Party of five? [IMITATES NIXON] I am not a crook. [CHARLIE IMITATING REAGAN] Oh, bullshit, Dickie. - Then why are you so sweaty? - [EMMA LAUGHS] [EMMA IN NORMAL VOICE] Man, he is really cross-eyed. [IN NORMAL VOICE] That's why he didn't find any weapons of mass destruction. [BOTH LAUGHING] [EMMA] So you have two kids, right? Yeah. Francine teaches math at a middle school in New Jersey. - Uh-huh. - And my son Rex is an architect. And, uh, Rex is a... He's a pretty brilliant kid. Well, he should be. He was born at the American Museum of Natural History. [BOTH LAUGH] This was so nice. Thank you. I wanna ask you a question. And I'm a little nervous about it, because I don't remember the last time I asked this, if ever. Would like to be my date for my granddaughter's bat mitzvah? Her name is Lindsay and she's the love of my life. And it would be like a goodbye party for you, except it's a bat mitzvah and not for you. I've never been to a bat mitzvah before. When is it? - I don't remember, but it's soon. - Way to narrow it down. - I have the invitation... - Doesn't matter when it is. - I'd be happy to go. - Yeah? - But only on one condition. - What's that? - That we dance together. - Oh, no, no, no. You don't understand. I'm a dangerous dancer, one of the few with mambo insurance. Oh, come on, Charlie. It'll be so much fun. All right. But to be on the safe side, wear a helmet and shoulder pads. - Done. - Great. What's the matter, Carrie? I just don't want the summer to be over. [CHARLIE] Well... maybe we just keep our summer going forever. Good idea, Charlie Burnz. Stop sign... Left. Whoa, sorry, pal. You can't go this way. Not safe. - This is the way I go. - Sir, go this way. Not safe here. - I don't know that way. - You gotta go that way. I don't know that way, this is the way I go every day. It's a new day. Cross the street and you'll be fine. - No! I have to go this way! - Hey, pal, come on. Move! - [GASPS] - [YELPS, THEN GROANS] [CHARLIE] Sorry. [BIKER] What's the matter with you? That's the way I go. I go that way. - [GASPS] - [TIRES SCREECHING] [DRIVER] What, are you crazy? What are you doing? - Get the hell out of the way! - [HORN HONKING] Hey! You, old man! Get the hell out of the way! You're in the middle of the road! What, are you deaf? [CELL PHONE CHIMES] Hey, old man! Am I crazy or did you say your son was born in a museum? [CHARLIE] Look at the size of this thing, honey. - [CARRIE] Charlie... - This is the only thing here that's bigger than you. Look at that wishbone! - [CARRIE] Charlie. - What? - I think my water just broke. - What? - We gotta get you out of here. - [GROANING] We gotta get you out of here. [CARRIE] Oh! - I'm not gonna make it. Oh! - Honey... I need a doctor! - I need a doctor! - What's the problem? - My wife's having a baby. - When? - Now! - I'm gonna ask the supervisor - if that's okay. - Are you kidding me? - I am a doctor. - What kind? - Proctologist. Okay. - Close enough. Oh, God. Oh, this baby's coming fast. Can you do it somewhere else? A tour group's coming through. Really? I have a baby coming through! Take a deep breath. Relax. Call an ambulance now. - Copy that. - [DOCTOR] Hi. You should know my name. It's Carrie. - Hi. Hello. - And that man who looks so scared is Charlie! - Hi, Charlie. - He's the daddy. - [DOCTOR] Good. - What's your name? I'm Joe Katz. Okay? Take a breath. Relax. You're doing just great. Now, listen. I'll need to remove your underwear. Oh, that's a bit aggressive for our first date, don't you think? - There we go. - [CARRIE GROANING] - What should I do next? - [CHARLIE] Nothing! Sure? They gave us a class with the doll... - [CHARLIE] Leave us alone! - Okay. Sorry. Charlie. This is like that time at Rye Playland, remember? At the top of the Ferris wheel? We were so drunk! - [CHUCKLES] - Are you okay? [CHARLIE] Just trying to think. Who took your panties off at Rye Playland? I wasn't there. - What? - It was Coney Island! Oh, you're right! - Oh, God. - Okay, lean forward slowly. And you're gonna push when I tell you. Carrie, you're doing great. Hey! What are you looking at? - Ew! - Get these scouts out of here! Come on, guys. Let's go. - Come on, boys. - This is bullshit! - [CHARLIE] You too! - Copy that. And just a reminder, - we close at 5:00. - Get out of here! - [YELLING] - Okay. The baby's here. The baby's here. So a big, deep breath and a big push, okay? - You can do it. There you go. - Okay. [GRUNTING] - [BABY CRYING] - [CARRIE GASPS] Okay. Here you go. Here you go. - Here you go. - Oh! It's a boy. It's a boy. It's a boy. [LAUGHING] [CARRIE WHISPERING] Hey, Charlie. Yeah? Let's name him Rex. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] That's the perfect name. Heh, I'm really glad we didn't have him under that big whale. Yeah. Because Moby Dick Burnz would be a terrible name for our son. He'd have so much trouble at school. [LAUGHS QUIETLY] Oh, I love you, Charlie Burnz. [WHISPERS] I love you too. [CHARLIE] What do my baby boy and a T-Rex have in common? [CHUCKLES] One is extinct, the other just stinks! All right, Roger. We'll cue you in five, four... Three, two, one... Good evening. And welcome to another episode of Old People Who Have Always Looked Old! Tonight's subjects are Keith Richards and the late Mother Teresa. - Oh, boy. Did you hear it? - Yeah. I did. - How does he get away with this? - I don't know. - [CHUCKLES] - All right, listen. These sketch ideas are good, but they don't always have to be so big. Sketches can be small, more personal. Something about yourself, maybe about your girlfriend or something. - That would be a problem. - Why is that? I don't have one. I'm incredibly single. See? That's funny. That I eat every meal alone? - Oh, that's hilarious. - Heh, no, no. I'm talking about a character for the show. The incredibly single guy. It's different than being single. It's incredibly single. There might be something funny in that. - Right. - Find out what's funny about you - and then write about it. - Okay. I'll try that. - Okay. - Can I tell you something? Yeah. When I was at Harvard, I had a humor class and I wrote a paper as you. - Really? - Yeah. I read all your plays, I knew your movie scripts. I could even tell what jokes were yours on whatever TV show you were writing on. So I wrote a paper in your style. Like you were at Harvard. - Wow. And how did it do? - Got an F. [BOTH CHUCKLE] The professor said we already have a great Charlie Burnz. We don't have a great Darrell Green yet. He was right. Anyway, um, working with you and knowing you is really special to me. Oh, thank you, Darrell. Listen, while I go get one of the crew to vacuum out the smoke you just blew up my ass, take a whack at the incredibly single guy, - see if there's something funny. - Deal. - Good. - [CELL PHONE RINGS] Oh, sorry. Um... Hello? Hi. Hi, yeah. No, I... What to wear? Oh, I don't... Well, how vintage? That's very vintage. Yeah, heh-heh. No, listen, uh... I'm at work, so can I call you back? Okay. Uh, bye. I'm taking a date to my granddaughter's bat mitzvah. She's a... really fun person. Never been to one before. - Neither have I. Can I go too? - [LAUGHS] I think one surprise for my family is all they can handle. And believe me, this young woman is full of surprises. - She sounds cool. - Yeah, she is. She's, uh... She's very cool. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] - What? - Well... you're blushing. - Your face is a little red. - Oh, that's... - blood pressure. Yeah. - Oh. Shouldn't have had the hot dog. Heh, it's... - See you in a little bit. - Bye. [LINDSAY] Now that I'm a bat mitzvah girl, um, I'd like to leave you with this one story. So I turned to Rabbi Teplis and I said, "I've been studying for years and years, and I ask you, 'What is the meaning of life?' And you tell me life is a cookie?" [ALL LAUGH] And Rabbi Teplis looked at me and said, "You mean it isn't?" [ALL LAUGHING] So anyways, to my parents, I love you so much. You've given me everything I have, and I wouldn't be here without you. Thank you so much. I love you. [HOST] Mazel tov! [HOST SPEAKS IN HEBREW] ["HAVA NAGILA" PLAYING] Let's get Lindsay up in the chair! [ALL CHEERING] [MEN] One, two, three! [LAUGHING] [HOST] Look out. Here comes Mom! - Up in the air, Francine. - [GASPS] Bend your knees, boys. Here comes Papa Charlie! [YELPS] Mazel tov! - Come on. Sit down. - [LAUGHS] [ALL CHEER] This is amazing! That's it, God. I'm converting! [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] Hi. I'm Francine. I'm Lindsay's mom. Mmm. She is so special. Oh. You must be so proud. - Yeah. - I'm Emma, by the way. - Oh, hi. - Nice to meet you. - Yes, nice to meet you. - These spare ribs are delicious! - Oh, good. - Mmm-hmm. So how long have you been dating my father? What? No, no, no. We're just friends. - I'm sure. - No. He's just really nice to me. - Mmm-hmm. - And I just love his writing. Oh. Okay. So, um... So, what do you do, Emma? For a living, I mean. - I'm a singer. - Wow. Anything I might be familiar with? No. But we got a whole bunch of videos that are blowing up on Instagram right now. - Cool. - You should come check us out. - We perform all over the city. - Where? - Uh... Mostly underground. - Like clubs? Sometimes, but more so subway stations. Like, uh, Columbus Circle, Union Square, Penn Station. You gotta check us out. You know what? I'm gonna get me some more ribs because I love meat. Anything I could pet, I eat. [CHUCKLES] [SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] [BOTH CHUCKLE] Lindsay... I have to tell you how proud I am of you that you wanted to have this bat mitzvah. And I wanna give you something. This... This was your Grandma Carrie's. And now it's yours. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Put your hair back. See if I can... Good. Oh, it looks perfect. - It's really pretty. - Yeah. I'm giving you this... because today is the first big step... with so many more to come. And I'll be there for you for all of that. And I can't wait to see who you're gonna become. I love you. I love you too. Thank you, Papa. [REX] Hey, Dad, by the way... I got that job I was telling you about. What job? The building in Union Square. Yeah. Anyway, they love my design. Great. Isn't that great? Good going, kid. Come here. Come here. Come here. That's great, huh? You know, Rex is an architect. I know. Anyone who's born in a museum is bound to be smart. - [CHUCKLES] - He told you about that? Yeah, he's very proud of you. - This is her first bat mitzvah. - What do you think so far? - It's okay so far. - Just okay? In the beginning, it was really hot with all the dancing and the chairs up, but... Ahem, all due respect to your tribe, but it's a little dull now. Well, the reading. It'll pick up again. Well, why don't we do something to help a little? Where you going? Dad. Dad! Hey, hey, hey. Do you have the instrumental for... [ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYS CHORD OVER SPEAKERS] Good evening, everybody. Um, my name is Emma Payge. I'm a very good friend of Papa Charlie's. And, Lindsay, could you please come on down to the dance floor? Uh... This is my first time ever coming to a bat mitzvah. And I have to say, so far, I feel so welcome. I'm having such a good time. DJ, hit that beat. And this one's for you, Lindsay. If you know the words to the song, sing along.

[BOTH LAUGH] You made the whole party. I think I had more fun than your family did. Why are they looking at me like that? Do they not know what's going on here? Actually, they don't. Emma, listen. You don't know everything. I mean, there's a lot of hard feelings. About what? Well, they both... Well, Francine especially. I wasn't around enough when they were kids. Which was probably true, but I was working, like, all the time. Then after Carrie died, there was a revolving door of nannies. And when I was there... I just had a lot of trouble giving them what they needed. I mean, I just was so sad. And what do they have against me? Well, after she passed away... I didn't wanna get involved with anybody. You know, I couldn't. So I dated a lot of younger women. So they probably looked at us thinking there's something else going on here. I'm really sorry they upset you. [VIOLIN STARTS PLAYING] Ladies and gentlemen, Itzhak Perlman. - [CHUCKLES] - That's him. - Does he take requests? - Itzhak Perlman is a genius. - He doesn't take requests. - You still owe me a dance. I danced with you. I danced the horah. The horah doesn't count. The horah's a dance. You run around, they lift you up, and you sweat into your clothes. - That's a dance. - Mmm-mmm. Doesn't count. Come on, Charlie. We're dancing. - Come on. - We're gonna go dance. - Who dances to a violin concerto? - We do. [BOTH LAUGH] Okay. What? Oh, there we go. - Look out. Look out. - [CHUCKLING] Whoo! [BOTH LAUGHING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDER CRASHING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GRUNTS SOFTLY] [SIGHING] - [CHARLIE] Whoa! - [GASPS] Where have you been? - When? - The last eight hours or so. - Here. - And just so I know, - where have I been? - Here. - With you? - Yeah. Oh, that's what I was afraid of. Really? I thought it was kind of nice. Emma, I didn't want for this to happen. I don't know what you mean when you say "this." But if the "this" you're referring to is that "this," it didn't happen. I got afraid of the thunder and lightning, and I snuck in here and spooned you. That's it. We just spooned. That's it? - That's it. - Okay. Look, you're an attractive older man, but your little, frail body would not be able to handle all these groceries. I'll break your back. It's too heavy for you. Can't ride this ride. The ride is too bumpy. You might dislocate your shoulder, then you'd die. Can't have that. Anyways, thank you for letting me sleep here. Mwah! You're sweet, Charlie. You might want to think about getting some bigger boxers. I'm not sure they can handle your groceries. They's just too little. [WOMAN OVER HEADPHONES] Three, two, one, now! I first became incredibly single when the fetus of my twin brother left the womb a month ahead of me, because... Well, he said he'd had enough. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] This continued when I was an infant, when my mom refused to breastfeed me. She said, "Let's take things slow and see where this goes." [ALL LAUGHING] And now I live in this studio apartment, where I lie awake at night and fantasize about having sex with another person. Which would be fun... so I've heard. And I think I'd be a pretty good lover. Find those hard-to-find spots that drive the women wild. - Because I have Google Maps. - [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] "In two inches, make a left." [LAUGHS] If you're also incredibly single like me, why not give me a call? - If not... - [CHUCKLING] ...then the wrath of my god, the great god Zoomgali, who is also incredibly single, will come and find you, and the sounds will color the sky, and he will come after you and your loved ones, and damn you to the fires of hell! [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So call me. You're killing me. Clear. Commercial. Two minutes. That was you. That's you, dude. - Killed it! - Thanks. - [CELL PHONE RINGING] - Oh, God. I thought my phone was off. Sorry. Hello. Yeah. I'm still at the show. I can't talk. - I found it. - What did you find? That great painting of that old house that was hanging in the empty space on your wall. Oh, it's beautiful. I rehung it. You're still at my house? Yeah. But I'm about to go back to my place. - Take it down. - What? Take it down. I don't wanna see it. I'm sorry. I thought you misplaced it. Emma, I don't wanna see it, understand? I just don't wanna see it. - Get rid of it! - Fine. [SIGHS] - New girlfriend? - Huh. I don't even know. Hey, you were right. - He's gonna be good. - Yeah. Three, two, one, now! In the world of music, Lady Gaga announced she is changing her name to "Lady Gagaga." She gave no explanation for her decision. According to a poll, Americans are concerned about a new axis of evil that threatens our country's democracy. North Korea, ISIS and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. [SIGHS] - Uh... Moving on. - No, no, no. Is anyone bothered by this but me? Do you hear that it's wrong? Your emphasis... You're an emphasis moron. [ALL LAUGHING] What the hell is he doing? Everything you say is off. It's not "wi fi," it's Wi-Fi. It's not "polar ice caps," it's polar icecaps. You are a comedy kamikaze. - Oh, wait. A "comma-kaze." - What the hell? Anybody with a correct amount of chromosomes... would know that it's Mitch McConnell, not "Mitch-McConnell." You make it sound like there a lot of McConnells! There's only one. There's no Stewie McConnell. Is there a Stewie McConnell in the house? No! What the hell is going on? Should we cut to commercial? - Go to commercial? - This is live. Just stay on it. Jesus Christ. No, I'm sorry. - "Jesus, Christ." - [ALL LAUGHING] Who, of course, was born in "Bethle-hem." I even put it on the cue card, because I had... - Know what this is? - I have no idea. No. Thank you, Al. Look at this. I had it written the exact same size so you would know. "Mitch McConnell," not "Mitch-McConnell." Mitch McConnell, you see that? Al. Camera one, spin around. Give me Al's reaction. Yeah. Tell everybody. Did I tell you that this would happen? - He told me this would happen. - Everybody. Exhibit A, Al! Thank you, Al, you sweet... Where is he going? Get him. Follow him. You. Look. Look, ma'am, what does that say? - "Mitch McConnell." - Thank you very much. You, you. Stand up. What does this say? - "Mitch McConnell." - Again. I can't hear you. - "Mitch McConnell." - We got a winner. - [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] - Dang it. Take anything off the top shelf, God damn it. Everybody, tell me. What does this say? - [ALL] "Mitch McConnell." - Can't hear you. - "Mitch McConnell." - One more time. - "Mitch McConnell." - Thank you. Roger, you're a very talented young guy. But I have to tell you, I am sick and tired of writing jokes for you and having you abuse them, you dumb turd. - Oh, boy. - [LAUGHS] Dumb turd! Everybody. Dumb turd! [ALL CHANTING] Dumb turd! Dumb turd! Dumb turd! Stand up. Dumb turd! Dumb turd! [LAUGHING] [ALL] Dumb turd! Dumb turd! Mom, Dad, come here. Papa Charlie is on television. Dumb turd! Dumb turd! [CHANTING CONTINUES] I say dumb, you say turd! Dumb... - [ALL] Turd. - Dumb... Oh, my God. You say dumb, I say turd. - [ALL] Dumb... - I need wide, wide, wide. - [ALL] Dumb... - Turd! - Dumb... - Turd! Dumb turd! Dumb turd! - [ALL] Turd! - Turd! That's it, I'm done. - Thank you. - [ALL APPLAUDING] Would you get those damn birds out of your hair? Larry! Camera one. Back to Roger and reset. Take one! - Thank you, "Charlie Burnz." - No, no! Charlie Burnz. - [AUDIENCE CHUCKLES] - Sorry. I'll work on it. That's the news of the night... Of the night. - The news of the... - [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I guess I'm a dumb turd. Thank you... Good night. [MARGE] And we're clear! What was that? What the hell was that? - [ALL] What the hell was that? - [LAUGHS] Charlie, what was that? That was hilarious. The schmuck can't get a name right. Really inspired idea, Charlie. Oh, my God, Charlie. That is live television. Charlie, why didn't you tell me? - I haven't told my kids yet. - I bet they know now. We're live. My fault. I should not have gone back in there. I'm so stupid. I'm just so stupid. It's my fault! Stupid? What are you talking about? Everyone loved it. - When did you think of this? - Comes to me all the time. Every second, it doesn't stop. That's why it was so good. It was so real. Holy shit, you guys. Twitter is blowing up. They love you, Charlie. They love the grumpy writer who can't bear to see his words mangled. - They think you're funny, man. - Funny? Funny? Saying I'll be back in a few minutes and never seeing that person again is funny? - Charlie, what... - It's not funny! - How can that be funny? - [OFFICER] Are you Charlie Burnz? Charlie Burnz. Mr. Burnz? I'm Charlie Burnz. Don't tell me that something's wrong. [BRAD] Charlie? Charlie? Nothing's wrong. It's okay. You're all right, Charlie. Hey, come back to my office. Lie down for a little bit. Yeah? I'm so tired. It's okay. It's okay. - Come on. - I'm really tired. It's all right. It's all right. - Until tonight, he's been fine. - [EMMA] Yeah. Sometimes he's just great. You'd never know he had a problem. And then it'll just hit him, but nothing like this. I had no idea. - It's our secret. - Our? - Nobody else knows? - No. Well, we have a problem. Social media has blown up. They love it. Everybody is asking, "Who is this guy?" They want him back next week. - I know it's gone viral. - Yeah. You know, I'm very nervous about what people... We need to post something right away. Twitter, Instagram. Sorry to interrupt. I just overheard. - Darrell, come on. - Let me do it, please. I know what to say. Okay. Good. - I have to run it by the network. - Okay. Uh, this is Charlie's friend Emma. This is Darrell, he works with Charlie. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. I'll get started. What a night. Okay, Charlie. There's the car. - Go ahead and get in. - Okay. - Yeah? - Yeah, I got it. - Thanks. - Hey, Charlie. - Yeah? - I just wanted to say good night and make sure you're okay. - Thank you. - Yeah. Hey, I, um... I posted that, "Tonight, Charlie Burnz showed why he's a comedy legend when he gave a hilarious one-time-only performance as a disgruntled writer. Thank YOU, Charlie. The crew and cast of This Just In. Hashtag 'dumb turd.'" [CHUCKLES] And I put the "you" in all caps so it was the wrong inflection. Thanks, kid. Good night, Charlie. You know, Darrell here is gonna be a terrific writer someday. [CHUCKLES] I don't know. I do. I'll see you, kid. [VIDOR] This is a scan of your brain in February. And this is the one we just took. They look the same to me. Yes, but your symptoms are changing. If I'm right, you may have a form of dementia called Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. What do you mean, if you're right? Only way to get a definitive diagnosis of CJD is... a post-mortem autopsy. Well... why don't we do that now? I mean, I have a lunch, but I could cancel that. What happens next? There are other medications than the ones you're on now... that could slow this down a bit, but before too long... Whoa, whoa, whoa. "Before too long" is how long? A year, maybe. You probably wanna start thinking about a caregiver. A nurse? Yes, or your family. - Your son and daughter. - Well... that's not happening. In times like this, you should be surrounded by loved ones, or professionals who are trained to care for you. Uh, I'll do it. I'll take care of Charlie. No, you can't. You're going away. My plans have changed. No. No, they haven't changed. She's in a band and they're supposed to go on tour. - Nah, I don't need to do that. - No. Yes, you do. She does need to do that. May I ask what your relationship is? - I don't know. - I don't know. How long have you known each other? I'm guessing about six months or so. Are you boyfriend and girlfriend? [SCOFFS] Are we? How would you define boyfriend and girlfriend? Well, are you having sexual relations? [BOTH] We spooned. Charlie... what about your kids? I honestly don't know if they've ever spooned. Charlie. - This is no time for jokes. - Yes, it is. It's the perfect time for jokes, God damn it. Don't try to take away my sense of humor. I'd rather die right now. Boy, this God... This God is a real jokester, isn't he? What a really funny God. "Hey, live your whole life and you won't remember any of it." [LAUGHS] Fuck you! - Damn it. - It's gonna be okay. How can this be okay? How can this be okay? My kids don't know anything. I'll tell them at the right time. Charlie. This is the right time. You can't be alone anymore. I'll take care of him till I can't. [VIDOR] I'll write you some prescriptions. I'll let the two of you be alone a bit. - What the hell is wrong with you? - What? - There's nothing wrong with me. - You're not staying. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. You heard what the doc said. It's over, okay? That's it. Please, leave me alone! - Charlie. - Don't "Charlie" me! You have a life! You have your music, so run. Run for the hills, kid. It's over. I'm telling you, it's over. Please, I just wanna be alone! - I'm not going anywhere. - I don't want you to stay! You hear me? What are you staying for? What's here? What's gonna be left? Nothing! That's not true, Charlie. I'm lost. I'm... Help, help, help. I'm lost. I'm so... I'm so lost. I'm sorry, pal. But I'm in. You wanna be with a stranger? [SIGHING] Pretty soon everyone's gonna be a stranger. Not me. I'm not gonna leave you. Thank you. Mmm. Hi. [SIGHS] Whose room did this used to be? Francine's. That explains the chill. Something wrong? I can't sleep. What's up? - I wrote something. - That's good. - I wanna read it to you. - Okay. This is my journal. I've been writing stuff for the book in it because typing has become a problem for me. I know. The book is called For Carrie. This is the dedication. A writer always dedicates the book to somebody he loves... - I know what it means. - Okay. [SHUSHING] "To Emma Payge. Thank you for taking my truth and making it more interesting. I kind of love you. CB." I kind of love you too, old man. Oh. Really? Yeah. Big-time. Didn't see that coming. You make me smile. Good night. Good night. Hey, Emma. I'm grateful to you that you're here. I wanna have fun. I wanna laugh. I want to not be scared. And I wanna write the book, and I wanna do all of that with you. But you have to promise me something. When it's time... you go back out and sing. You're an artist, and that's what you should do. Please, promise me. I promise. Good. I'm a bargain for 22 bucks, don't you think? Heh. Hell, yeah. - Good night. - Good night. [SNORING SOFTLY] [FLOORBOARD CREAKS] Oh. I must've dozed off. These new meds are making me very sleepy. I haven't taken a nap since the Carter administration. - What do you have there? - Nothing. Let me see. It... - It's that... - Emma, I know what it is. I know you said get rid of it, but it's just so beautiful. Give it to me. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Carrie painted this. Yeah. See, she put her name in the bushes. - See there? In the trees. - Mmm-hmm. This is Lake Charlie. Lake Charlie. Where's that? That's about two hours north of the city. Yeah. Carrie gave me a lake for my birthday. A lake? Yeah. It was actually a pond. But Pond Charlie didn't sound as good as Lake Charlie, heh. - Wait. Wait, wait, wait. - What? Tell me all about Lake Charlie. Okay. It was my 40th birthday. Happy birthday, Charlie Burnz. - [MAN] Happy birthday. - [WOMAN] Happy birthday, Charlie. [CHARLIE] We had a party outside in the garden. And after everybody was gone... Carrie shows me this photograph of this woodsy area with this beautiful lake on it. Happy birthday, Charlie Burnz. This is for you. [CHARLIE] For me? What is this? What am I looking at? - It's called Lake Charlie. - Lake Charlie? [CHARLIE] She was always trying to get me to stop working. And just be alone with her and do nothing. And honestly the thought of doing nothing terrified me, you know? But I loved it so much and it meant so much to her that we'd go up there, you know, and camp out, like, in a tent. Can you imagine me in a tent? I mean, to me, the great outdoors would be a lot better if it was indoors. Good morning! [CHARLIE GROANING] [CHARLIE] That smells good. Smells better than me. - [CHARLIE CHUCKLES] - [LAUGHING] [CHARLIE] Mmm. Wow... Whoa! Look what you did. [CARRIE CHUCKLING] - Hey, Charlie? - Yeah? - You know what I think? - What? - I think we need a house. - A house? Yeah. The kids will love it up here. - What? Kids? - Didn't I tell you? And that's how she told me she was pregnant with Rex. So she went looking for a house. Wait, didn't you guys build a house? Oh, no, that's way too easy for Carrie. She scoured the countryside, found this little house, she bought it, lifted it up, put it on a flatbed truck and she drove it to Lake Charlie. [CARRIE] Got a house, Charlie Burnz! - [HORN HONKING] - [CARRIE WHOOPING, THEN LAUGHS] Thank you. So we put in a new foundation, plopped the house down on it, renovated it, painted it up, made it a little bit bigger. - Mmm-hmm. - It was our happy place. Dad, come on! Let's go play. Daddy, come on! - And she was right. - Daddy, come on. Are you playing or not? The kids loved it. Aw. Now I know why you didn't wanna hang the picture. No, you don't. I'm tired. I can't talk anymore. Come on, Charlie. Please? Don't take this with you. I'm not going anywhere yet. Okay. My first Broadway play, It's My Time, it opened at the Belasco Theatre. Reviews were terrific, business was great, but that wasn't enough for me. The star was an actor named Jerry Orbach, and there was this one speech late in the second act. It never landed right. It drove me crazy. All I wanted was one show that was just perfect. Things were tense... between the two of us. - I'd been working so much. - What are we doing? I'd been on the road for four months with the play before it came to Broadway. Everybody was looking forward to spending some time together at Lake Charlie, and what was I doing? I was rewriting a play that was already a hit. Charlie, we have to go right now. Traffic's gonna be awful. I don't like driving in the dark. My mom's got the kids there waiting. We should have left an hour ago. I had to rewrite a speech for Jerry. - It wasn't landing right. - Oh. Great. Okay. - That's just great. - He's reading it. I wanna make sure it's okay with him. Oh. You wanna make sure it's okay with him? With him? How about with me? How about with the kids, who you haven't seen for months? You promised me. You promised us. Stop yelling. Five minutes, I promise. - I'll be right in and right out. - The kids are waiting. I understand. I'll be right out. The people are in line, - the show goes up in an hour. - Five minutes? Yeah. Yeah. I know you're upset, but I hate when you get like this. If you're not back in five minutes, - I'm leaving without you. - I heard you, okay? I heard you. God damn it. It took 15 minutes. When I came out, she was gone. I was angry. So I watched the show, that damn speech still didn't land right. I had a couple drinks with Jerry and then I came back here... And the next thing I remember is flashing lights. And a policeman in the doorway asking me my name over and over again. And I'm thinking if I don't answer him, then maybe what he's about to tell me didn't happen. He told me Carrie was driving on this dark road right near the house. She came to this fork in the road... and some kid loaded on pills driving a Jeep ran the stop sign. And he hit her head-on. She died instantly. Kid walked away without a scratch. The last time I saw that beautiful face, she was mad at me. That's why I can't look at that picture anymore. It makes me remember the one thing I want to forget. [SOBS SOFTLY] [SNIFFLES] I'm sorry. Me too. - Need anything from the store? - Um... Wonton soup. I'd like to shampoo my hair. It's getting a little greasy... - Charlie. - What? - I'm just kidding. I'm okay. - [CHUCKLES] - I promise. Thanks. - Good. Hey, I was thinking, you know what we could do someday? It could be fun. Um... Ever been to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum? You ever been there? It's a lot of fun. It's pretty amazing what they do. Okay. Sure. [SIGHS] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] You're back already? Okay. Coming, coming, coming. - [CHARLIE] Hi! - [LINDSAY] Hi. [CHARLIE] Come on in. Come on in. This is a surprise. What's the matter? You look very upset. What's wrong? - I had a fight with my mom. - Oh. She said you were drunk and embarrassing. I said you could never be. You were funny on the show. Why does she keep you away from me? She said something awful. - Does she know where you are? - She thinks I'm at school. - How did you get here? - Uber. - We should tell her you're here. - No! - She'll be so mad at me. - But, Lindsay... Please. I just have to know if it's true. Is what true? She said it was because of you that I don't have a grandma. She said that to you? No. I overheard her on the phone with Uncle Rex. No, Lindsay, no. Okay. [SIGHS] Lindsay never made it to school, Rex. She used my Uber account, and guess where she took it to. Charlie, I got your wonton soup, but the chef said that you need to use extra conditioner... Charlie! I got some short ribs. They'll be so good. Charlie? Charlie? Charlie! Where are you, old man? Charlie, stop playing. Hey. Where is she? - How'd you get in here? - We grew up here. Where is she? - Who? - My daughter Lindsay. - And our father. Where's our dad? - Lindsay! - Dad! - Nobody's here. I just got home myself. - Home? - Do you live here? - I moved in a few days ago. - Oh, lovely. - Your dad needs me right now. - I bet he does. You might want to rethink your attitude, Francine. What is this? What is all this about? That's research for a project he's working on. With our names under the pictures? - He doesn't know who we are? - Not all the time. Your father's sick. He has a form of dementia. And it's getting worse. He can't be alone anymore. That's why I moved in, Francine. I'm his friend. He's writing a book about your family and I'm helping him finish it. - I can't believe this. - We had no idea. That's because you're too busy being pissed at him. Pretty soon, before you know it, he's not gonna know who you are. But you'll remember him. He's done a very good job of beating himself up without you guys piling on. You were very happy once. It can happen again if you let it. How do we find them? I put a GPS on his phone. - Okay. - Let me see. [CELL PHONE RINGING] - No. No, no, no. - It's here. It's here. - Where the hell are they? - Damn. Oh. If she's still using my Uber account, we can find them. [CELL PHONE BUZZING] [DRIVER SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN] [IN ENGLISH] I cannot believe this. - Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong? - Longer trip than I thought. You give five star. I accept nothing less. Is this the best way to go? This is all my fault. She overheard what I said to you. - We got in a fight... - She heard that? Yes. I know. I'm sorry, okay? - What if he does something crazy? - What's he gonna do, Francine? What's gonna happen? - I don't know. - He loves Lindsay. Nothing will happen. How can you be so sure? I know him. Papa! Where are you going? Come back! - Please stop! - Hey, what about my five stars? - [CELL PHONE RINGS] - Oh, God! Lindsay, honey, are you okay? Papa Charlie ran away! He told the driver to pull over, jumped out of the car and ran. I'm scared. I'm in the woods. Lindsay, don't worry. Look around. Can you see anything? - I can see the road. - Go there. Go to the road. We're gonna find you. Mom! Mom! [FRANCINE] Lindsay! Sweetheart. Come on, baby girl. - Oh, my God, Rex. - I know. Let's find him. [FRANCINE] Dad? - [LINDSAY] Papa Charlie? - Dad? - [EMMA] Charlie? - [LINDSAY] Papa Charlie? No, Dad. No. Please, Dad. Dad? - [EMMA] Charlie? - [REX] Dad? - [REX KNOCKING] - [GASPS] Charlie! Papa Charlie! [EMMA] Charlie! - Dad! - [EMMA] Charlie! - Dad! - [REX] Dad? - Charlie! - Papa Charlie! - [FRANCINE] Dad! Dad! - [EMMA] Charlie! - Dad! - Papa Charlie, where are you? Charlie! Charlie. Oh, hey. - Hey. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. You okay? - My feet are wet. Mine are too. Are you okay? You look so upset. I'm just happy to see you. Dad. What are you doing here? Hi. Uh... Well, I wanted to show Lindsay Lake Charlie. This was our happy place. See, sunsets, we'd stand right here. And... And we'd watch the sun go down there and, "Bye-bye, sun. Bye-bye, sun." Somebody would say that. That was me, Dad. - I said that. - Yeah. Mmm-hmm. - I'm sorry about your mother. - No. - Dad, you don't have to... - No, I have to. I have to, Rex. Let me finish, because I'm running out of words. Francine, I was not the reason your mom died. That kid who ran the stop sign was the reason your mom died. And I adored her so much. I loved your mother so much. And she died mad at me. Dad. I can't leave here knowing that you're mad at me too. I can't undo it. I can't undo it. There's no rewrites this time. Come on. Relax. Relax your hands. No more fists. Relax your hands. [CRYING] Dad. Why didn't you tell us? Because I didn't know how. And I was scared. Of what? That maybe you wouldn't care. Oh, Dad. Forgive me. Please. Forgive me so I can forgive myself. Because the sight of your angry eyes keeps me up at night and gives me the sweats, and there's no more time for that. There's no more time. I'm here today. Daddy, I'm so sorry. Franny, it's okay. It's okay. I understand. I understand. - I love you, Pop. - Oh! - I love you. - [LINDSAY] Is there room for me? - Come here, sweetie. - I love you too, you know? [ALL LAUGH] Emma. Emma. Come here. Oh, God. What a long time between hugs. [ALL LAUGH] [CHARLIE INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY] [TYPEWRITER CLACKING] [CHARLIE] Mom was always inventing days for the kids. Kids loved "Backwards Day" the best. We'd have dinner for breakfast and breakfast for dinner. No, Pop. It was "Upside-down Day." Upside-down day. God, I loved that. We'd have cake for breakfast. - Can we do that? - Yeah. Will you do it with us, Papa Charlie and Emma? - Absolutely. - Yeah, sure. Anything for you. - Is it upside-down day? - Yeah. Upside-down day. I got it. Upside-down day is great. - Yeah? - [DARRELL] This'll be really good. Okay. [CHUCKLES] Huh. Hey, Rex, um... Oh, tell them the story about when Dad was barbecuing outside, he was making all these hot dogs and a bear came. - [REX] Oh, heh-heh! - That's a really good story. - Okay, I think it was July 4th? - Uh-huh. Dad loves 4th of July. [REX SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] It's beautiful here. Mmm-hmm. Are you okay? I'm here.
