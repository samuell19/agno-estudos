Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes. - Does Mrs. Augusta Pritchard live here? - Yes. Telegram. Is this a welcome for the prodigal son? Where's the pot of jam? Where are the maidens strewing flowers? What, no brass bands? Hello, Mr. Allan! What are you doing home? It's the middle of June, my Matilda, and school is out. - Who's that for, me? - No, your mother. - Is Mother home? - What is that noise, Matilda? Who is it? Two pieces of bad news have come, Mother. Me and a telegram. Telegram? Oh, my goodness! Who from, what does it say? Is it really bad news? Here, here, no welcome for me? - Dear me! - Oh, this suspense is terrible. It's from My brother Cabot. What does he want? Why, he's having a memorial service at Barrville... for Lovesy Barr tomorrow noon at twelve. He expects us both to be there. How can Cabot order services for Lovesy when... when they're not absolutely sure she's dead? That's right, some of the missionaries escaped, didn't they? Yes, they ran, but Lovesy would never run, she was a Barr. All right, your niece has been drowned in China, or maybe she hasn't. We're asked to a memorial service, you're going. I'm staying home. I don't have to go, I'm not a Barr. When I adopted you you became a member of the family. Oh hello, dear, how are you? I'm so glad you're here. It's about time. - Mrs. Helen Barr? - Yes. Sign here, please. Thank you. - Mother! - Yes, dear? - Telegram for you. - A telegram? Open it, Marjorie. - It's from Cabot Barr. - Your grandfather? After all these years. As you may or may not know, Lovesy is probably dead, stop. Drowned in China, stop. Probably, stop. They never recovered her body, stop. Memorial services will be held at my house tomorrow, twelve noon. Stop. Goodness, Mommy, this is insane. "Probably drowned in China." Whether she's dead or not, we'll have a memorial service. It's just the sort of thing your grandfather would do. You don't know what he's like, you can't remember. Why is he suddenly sending you this disgusting invitation? - Is it an invitation? - Of course it is. It's evident he wants to make up with you. - Are you going? - Do you want to go? - I'm not asked. - No! Then we won't go. We'll send flowers. - Perhaps you'd better go, Mommy. - Why should I? He behaved like a lunatic when you were born because you weren't a boy. I stood his temper as long as I could... and finally I marched out of the house bag and baggage. Baggage? Does that include me, Mommy? - Well, what is it? - It's for Mr. Barr. - He said he wasn't to be disturbed. - Give it to me. - Yes? - A telegram for you, Judd. This place smells like a speakeasy. I don't see why you're kicking up all this fuss about a few thousand. Ordinarily we'd extend your credit, but as you know, Barr, your father is a little peculiar. Yes, he might leave his money elsewhere. It won't make a particle of difference if he does. - I'll get it. - Yes? I expect you gentlemen to keep the contents of this book to yourselves. A little record of his so-called eccentricities. In case my father proves himself unresponsive... to the devotion of his only son, I think this will settle matters in my favor. Claude. How can I concentrate with that thing playing? Turn it off. I can't turn it off while it's playing that particular tune, sir. Mr. Barr would be furious. You know he likes that song better than anything in the world. I always turn it on while he's dressing. Yes, I know, but I can't keep my mind on... I'm sorry, sir. This stuff you put on my hair. Makes me smell like a French novel. I say, Cabot, what's the idea of this memorial service? I'm holding services for Lovesy because she was a Barr. She was my late brother's only daughter. And she did something. I have a great respect for people who do something. That goes there. She certainly had been raised to go to China and become a missionary. So she went. Though personally she loathed the Chinese. That's the sort of stuff the old Barrs are made of. All right, I didn't say they weren't. Besides, I wanted some excuse for bringing the remnants of my family together. I want to see how they look at each other. I want to see how they look at me. I can't give Christmas parties, I'm not that sort of a man. So I thought we'd have a family funeral. - Have you stopped the clocks, Claude? - Just those on the second floor, sir. - What about those downtairs? - I was just going to stop them... when you asked me to shave you. - Well, I'm shaved. - Yes, sir. Why don't you put your black jack on your red queen? Who's playing the solitaire anyway? Those were the Barrs. Fine upstanding Barrs, those were. That was Sir Joshua Barr. A great man. Queen Bess's time. Accompanied Essex on that disastrous expedition to Ireland. Came back with him. And Elizabeth chopped off Essex' head. Chopped off Joshua'a head too. He looks thick-necked enough. I'll bet the executioner had to take two chops. He did! But Joshua never winced. The first Cabot Barr. Helped Cromwell to get rid of Charles. Afterwards disagreed with Cromwell... and lost his head. All the Barrs seem to have lost their heads. In the line of duty yes! In a crisis never. Those were the old Barrs. And I had hoped that my descendants were going to carry on the tradition. And what do I draw for a son? Judd, a pussyfoot, a washout, a gambler, waiting to squander the Barr fortunes as soon as I'm gone. If your son Warren had only lived. Yes... but he didn't. And if his wife Helen had only had a boy... instead of that sniveling female infant she produced, we... Oh well, today there are no Barrs worthy of the name. How are you, Claude? Why, ma'am, you haven't changed a bit. You've changed, Claude, you're looking better. - Is Mr. Barr expecting you? - Well, he wired me, but whether he's expecting me or not, I can't say. - This is the baby. - Miss Marjorie, it don't seem possible. Is Mr. Barr expecting her? - I think not. - Well, ma'am... Don't be afraid, Claude. We've been turned out once before. We can stand it again. - Have a cigar, Henry? - No, no, no, thanks. - I'll have a cigarette. - You boys... Cabot, did you ask Helen for today? I sent her a wire. - Did you tell her to bring the girl? - Certainly not! I don't suppose Helen will come either. There she is. Proud as a peacock. Look at her. Proud, aren't you? Pigheaded, that's what you are! After sixteen years I make the first advance and you ignore it. All right, you can go to the devil! Now you're exciting yourself. Here, let feed your pipe. Go away! I don't enjoy holding hands with you. I'll go downstairs and see who's come. Yes, but Cabot, don't be rude to your family. - I'm never rude to my family. - Oh, no! I sometimes tell them a few bold truths. It does them good. - Well, you go and see who's there! - I haven't finished my game. Now, Henry, you've got a black ten on a red queen. And there are two nines on top of one another. You're one of those cheating old maids. Oh! How many clocks has Mr. Barr in the house now, Claude? A hundred and four, ma'am. Or rather, a hundred and five with the new one. A hundred and six when the other one he ordered comes. That'll be Wednesday. Any other fancies my father has indulged in lately, Claude? - Fancies, sir? - Like clocks, things like that. None that I can think of, sir. Unless you'd call the stuffed peacocks a fancy. - Stuffed peacocks? - Yes, sir, for the summer camp. Although he's not going up there this year. Not going up? Why not? Mr. Loring was telling him he'd better go. It would do him good. And so... well, you know conferring he is. Yes... but you haven't explained about the stuffed peacocks. Oh, yes, sir. Your father likes peacocks. Thinks they're a nice decoration. But live ones, you know, make such ugly noises... so he's going to have stuffed ones instead. He's going to put them on the lawn. - On the lawn? - Yes. Stuffed peacocks on the lawn. Where's the family? Is everybody here? Well! Aunt Augusta, how are you? Badly. - How do you do, Aunt Augusta? - How are you, Retta? Claude, where are you going? - To stop the clocks. - You might take my things. The household. - This is a very sad occasion for all of us. - You don't have to tell me what it is. I know... perfectly well, poor Lovesy. I was going to... to... Augusta, Augusta, guess who's here? Oh, I'm much too old for guessing games, Henry Loring. - Helen Barr and her daughter. - Helen in this house, where? Come on. - Helen! - Augusta! - So, Cabot finally gave in. - Yes, he sent for me. This is Allan. - How do you do, Allan? - How do you do? You're growing very pretty, my dear. - Don't you think she's like her grandfather? - Is he very pretty? - He's an ugly old devil. Allan, this is Marjorie. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Oh, hello, Judd. - How are you, Helen? - This is my wife Retta. - How do you do? Er... Marjorie... this is my daughter Marjorie. This is your uncle Judd and your aunt Retta. - How do you do? - How do you do? Reunions, reunions always do this to me. Allan, your handkerchief. I gave you the only one I had, what did you do with it? I don't know, I don't... Judd... Oh, thank you, thank you. - Have you seen your father? - He's not down yet. My opinion is that Father is a very sick man. - Nonsense. - Mr. Loring agrees with me. Why, Henry Loring is a fool. Henry, you're a fool. Oh, thank you, Augusta. You might as well all go back home. There's been a mistake. My niece Lovesy has let me down. - She's not dead. - What are you talking about? This cablegram just came. From the American consul at Zhoukou. "Have found woman suffering from amnesia, who answers description of Miss Lovesy Barr." Why, that's wonderful news. - There you are, I told you so. - But it may not be Lovesy. The cable only says this woman looks like her. Nobody ever looked like Lovesy but Lovesy. That's her great-aunt Katherine. - Claude! - Yes, sir. - Have you stopped the clocks? - Yes, sir. - Well, start them again. - I beg your pardon, sir? What are you begging my pardon for, what have you done? Start the clocks. Yes, sir. - There'll be no service after all. - No. Sorry to disappoint you. You can all go home. Well, you're going to ask us to stay for lunch, aren't you? If you're hungry, and think you can stand it. - What do you mean? - Well, the whole family... feeding to get up and then go fight. I don't advise it. - So you came. - So you sent for me. I merely sent you a wire stating certain facts. Your coming was an act of pure volition on your part. I came because you asked me to. Sixteen years. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? - What for? - For your pigheadedness, for your filthy temper, for deserting me. You forbad me to enter your house, what did you expect me to do? I expected you to come back and ask for my forgiveness. What for? Don't keep on using that gutter-English 'what for'. Where did you pick it up? I was sent out into the gutter sixteen years ago. Don't exaggerate. You were a pretty little one. Well... let's have a look at you. - I must say that you've worn well. - Thank you. Your face is a trifle rattled. But thank heaven you've kept your stomach down. Thank heaven for that. If women were only trained on their stomachs, and watched their spread amidships, the world would be a far pleasanter place for a man to live in. You haven't asked after... Well, here we are, a family party. What a collection. Augusta, you're bulging in the most outrageous places. - No, Cabot, I am not! - Yes, you are. You're convex where you ought to be concave and vice-versa. Cabot, I won't have you treat me that way. Ah, she has blood pressure, yes, you have! Those hot puffs on her face at the least emotion, they're blood pressure. She'll go out and pop one of these days... in a fit of apoplectic rage, you mark my words. - Wouldn't you like to meet... - Uh... and uh... Look at... look at little Retta here. She's only thirty five. - How old are you, Retta? - Why, thirty five. There you are! Now, when she was first thirty five, some six or seven years ago, she was as narrow as an eel. She's skinny now, but she's spreading... she's unmistakeably spreading. Really, Father! And, uh, look at my son Judd. If you can do so without shuddering. He not only bulges but he... Well, this is about Judd, it doesn't matter. I think grandfather is rather a darling. Oh... do you? I'm sorry I can't return the compliment. Marjorie. And why in heaven's name do you think I'm a darling? I don't know. You're funny. Funny? I think of funny things but I haven't the courage to say them. What kind of funny things do you think of? The kind of things you say. - At your age? - I suppose it's because I'm like you. - You're not the slightest bit like me. - Mother says I am. And punishes you for it, I suppose. Oh, no, she says I have some of your good qualities. And tell her that I was not aware that she recognized any good qualities in me. - Telegram for you, sir. - Oh! What is it? - Claude! - Yes, sir. - Did you start the clocks? - Yes, sir. Well, stop them again. Cabot, what is it? The woman who was suffering from amnesia has recovered. She's a Russian dancer from the former Imperial Ballet. - Lovesy couldn't dance a flip. - It isn't Lovesy. Lovesy's dead. We'll have her service after all. Oh my, please! Not only drowned but mistaken for a Russian dancer. - Allan, give me your handkerchief. - You had it. What did you do with the one I gave you? - Here, dear, take mine. - Thank you. Give her a chair, somebody. We'll all sit down until Augusta has finished sniffling. So... Are you finished? Lovesy is finally and irrevocably dead. The last of the Barrs, except us. Well, I expect you'll be the next, Augusta, with that blood pressure of yours. Cabot, I won't have you talk about such things. Oh, very well, I'll be the next, if you like. Remember, I want to be buried in white satin. Oh, don't. And not gray, which I know is your favorite color. White... Helen! If Augusta dies before I do, remember white satin for me. I'll remember, Father. I'll die when I like and not before. Cabot, don't talk about such things, they're horrible. Horrible? Not at all. On the contrary, very beautiful. I've earned my living, I haven't been niggardly. Life's been like a bottle of fine old wine. I've drunk slowly and with discrimination. And I'm about ready for the next bottle. Death, the next bottle. The Lord made them both, so I know the second bottle won't be bitter. It comes from the same vineyard that the first. Oh, dear. Meanwhile, I'm a trifle bored. Too much family. I'll go to my room and play solitaire. I'm a stupid player... without cheating. Let me help you, Father. I learned to walk without help some seventy-odd years ago. I'm still able to do it. I suppose you'd let me fall down... and break every bone in my body before you'd offer to help me. I didn't think you wanted anyone to help you, Grandfather. All right, she can stay for the service. It will do her good. She probably never reads her Bible. I beg your pardon, I didn't see you there. It's so comfortable here. - Claude. - Yes, sir? - How long before the service begins? - In fifteen minutes. The family are out in the conservatory having a glass of sherry wine. - Wouldn't you care to join them? - I just came from there. They're not only having sherry but an argument. That seems to be a Barr characteristic, doesn't it? - They do dispute among themselves. - They do. By the way, Mrs. Helen Barr's little girl wasn't there. Isn't she entitled to a glass of sherry? She didn't seem to want any, sir. But being a Barr you'd think she'd want to join in the argument. - She's rather pretty, isn't she? - Very, sir. I mean, it's too bad that a pretty girl like her should be such a hypocrite. Hypocrite, sir? Didn't you see the way she was making up to the old man? You can't tell me that she did that for any other reason... except that she's after his money. What's the matter, got a cold? - No, sir. - But she won't get it. She's only a female Barr. But a very pretty one, sir, eh? Oh, pretty enough, but greedy. - Where is she? - Right behind you, sir. - Spying, eh? - Reading. You let me go on talking about you and did nothing to show that you were present. - What should I have done. - You could have made a noise of some sort. Those remarks you made, particularly that one about my being after my grandfather's money... deserves much more than a noise. You should have your face slapped, don't you think so, Claude? Well, miss, of course he didn't know you were here. That's all the more reason for his not saying things like that, isn't it? Well now, miss... A gentleman doesn't do that sort of thing, does he, Claude? Well, miss... I'm afraid a gentleman doesn't. I think I'd better go now. Ex-convict. You seem to get a delight in knocking everybody here. Well, that's what he is. Everybody knows he's been in prison. Your grandfather had him released twenty years ago and hired him as his butler. I know all about it. Only a Barr would do a crazy thing like that. Only a Barr would have the courage. So you think I said those things to my grandfather because I'm after his money. - Sounded that way. - You're a stinker. - What did you say? - You're a complete, unmitigated, thorough, post-graduate stinker. All right, I'm a stinker. And you have no designs on your grandfather's money. Oh, no... Excuse me, I just remembered I forgot to stop the cuckoo clock. That would be a fine to-do right in the middle of the service, wouldn't it. I mean, if it went off suddenly. Mr. Barr would boil me in oil. Swell idea if he did. So, you think I'm after my grandfather's money. - That's what I think. - All right! - What are you doing? - Starting the clocks. - But your grandfather... - Yes, he will loathe it! - He'll raise a terrible hullabaloo. - So will the clocks probably. That'll prove to you that I'm not after his money. - He'll have you thrown out of the house. - Or boiled in oil. - Scared, aren't you? - Me scared? Afraid he might suspect you. Oh, am I? Well, I'll stop them all over the house. - I'll show you whether I'm scared or not. - I'll do all my clock starting. - Good morning, Dr. Weston. - Good morning. As soon as the family are ready I'll give you the signal. No... I have a very bad cold. - In fact, I've practically lost my voice. - That's too bad, sir. When I blow my nose... I'm all right again for a while. But unfortunately in a few moments, in fact, almost immediately, it starts up again... and I become quite inaudible. Dear, dear, that's most unfortunate, sir. However, Claude, I shall do my best on this occasion. As I do on every other occasion. The town's people have come and Dr. Weston is ready. I'll go up and tell Mr. Barr. All right... You may all sit down. Would you like me to sit next to you, Father? No. Where's that girl? Oh, there you are. Don't rustle. Remember this is no theater. It's not an entertainment. It's a very solemn occasion. All right. We may begin. They're ready, sir. My friends, we are gathered here on this solemn occasion... to do honor to the memory... of our departed sister Lovesy Barr. A woman of great... A woman of great character. of sterling qualities. And I am proud to say... (speaking inaudibly) - What's the matter with the man? - He's suffering from a very bad cold. - What's that? - He's blowing his nose, sir. Though man's span of life is but three score year and ten, a very short period, my dear friends. Though he labor... Though he labor to produce... I say, though he labor to produce... Yes, and it profit him nothing... if he is... I doubt whether it would do this graceless and disgraceful gathering any good, but nevertheless, I will say grace. Why are you all brooding over your soup? At your age, Augusta, I should call it a silly prank. Call what a silly prank? Starting those clocks. Why... Why, Cabot, how can you say such... I did nothing of the kind. Oh... Oh... Oh, my Goodness! I gather that you're trying to deny your guilt. Trying to deny it? You think for one moment that could... Tears in a woman are a sure sign of a guilty conscience. I won't stay in your house another moment! I absolutely refuse to eat your food. Sit down, son. Just because my sister displays bad manners... there's no reason why you should. She probably only helped to start the clocks. It was somebody else's idea. Somebody who wished to see me in an early grave. That can be only one person. Well, Judd, what do you have to say for yourself? - Why, Father. - Don't you worry fathering me. I call it a shabby trick. There are some things that even a devoted son cannot accept from his father. Such an accusation is too much. I'm leaving. - Grandfather! - What? Criticising me, miss? Is this the way you bring up your daughter, madam? - Tell her to sit down! - Sit down, Marjorie. I thought you were going. What are you waiting for? I did it, Father, I started the clocks. You did nothing of the kind. You're merely trying to shield Henry. - He has practically confessed. - I have not confessed, Cabot! Why should I confess for something that I... Your silence was a confession, sir! I shan't eat another morsel. Now I shall ask you all to be good enough... to leave me alone. I have something very unpleasant to say to Claude. Come along, Marjorie. I'm coming, Mother. Well, why don't you go? I want to hear first what you have to say to Claude. Very well, you shall. So, you would stand by and let women take the blame for your crime. - What do you mean? - You know you started those clocks! - You're discharged! - Really, Mr. Barr, sir, I... Stop crying into the beans. Too much salt in them already. Tell that to the cook. Then pack up your things and go. You can't do that, Grandfather. Mother wanted to take the blame because she thought I did it. And she was right, I did. I started the clocks. And I helped her. I wondered how long it would be before you confessed. - I tried. - Only very feebly. All right, Claude, I forgive you. Thank you, sir. A very disgraceful thing to do. A very disrespectful thing. - Hooligans, both of you! - It's my fault. I... Nothing like this has ever happened in this house before. You, miss, are a Barr. I can't understand your doing such a thing. You are not a Barr, but I entertained a certain regard for you. Now, sir, that regard has vanished. Leave me alone. She owned up! She's a Barr! Every inch of her. Grandfather. Then you're not angry because I started the clocks? Angry? Why, it was magnificent. Come here. Sit down. Well, why did you do it? Well, Allan said I was trying to get around you. - Well? - Because of your money, you know. So I did the worst thing I could think of to make you mad. Why weren't you born a boy? - I've always liked being a girl. - Oh. - But now I wish I weren't. - Why? Because you wish I were. Well, I'm liable to think you are trying to get around me. You won't think anything of the sort. No, I won't. If only you'd been born a... oh, well... It's too late now. You're a female And when you marry you'll be your husband's possession. Even to the extent of sacrificing your name. Well, I won't marry then. If it'll make you happier, I'll stay single. I won't mind being an old maid. Then I can keep on being a Barr. Well, but if you died there'd be nobody to carry on the name. Unfortunately old maids don't have sons. At least not in Massachusetts. Suppose I married a really nice man. Someone you liked. And you persuaded him to change his name to Barr. By Jupiter! That's the solution. Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings? Would that make you happy? It's an inspiration! Have you got a man like that? - No, of course I haven't. - Well, I have! I've got the very man, Allan! Allan Blaine? Allan Barr he is to be. Give me long distance. Boston. Beacon 27400 Me marry him? It's all settled. We'll handle him now. Grandfather, I couldn't do it. Now, don't argue, you'll do as I say. Grandfather, we've just become friends after sixteen years, don't spoil everything. What's the matter with you? It's your own suggestion now you're objecting to it. I never suggested marrying Allan Blaine. - Oh, didn't you, well I did. - Well you marry him then. Why, I wouldn't marry him if we were marooned together on a desert island. Temper! She's a Barr, every inch of her. Marooned together on a desert island. Claude! Yes, sir. I want you to open the summer camp immediately. But you said this morning, sir, that you didn't. I know. But I've changed my mind. I feel the desire for a romantic atmosphere. Birds... bees... Flowers, trees... - Go away! - Yes, sir. I'm bored, aren't you? I am now. Oh, meaning since I appeared on the scene. Meaning just that. Well, don't think that I'm trying to make friends with you, I'm not. I'm very glad to hear it. It's just that you represent something a little less boresome than stuffed peacocks. And a lot of stuffy people. Not much less, however. Well, I like the people and I adore the peacocks and I dislike you. And if I can't read while you're around, I'll go elsewhere. If I were a man, I'd... If you were a man you wouldn't have to try so hard to get your grandfather's money. You'd get it anyway. - It hasn't worked. - What hasn't worked? The birds, the bees, the flowers. What are you talking about, Cabot? - I'll give them artificial respiration. - You'll give them what? Artificial respiration, to bring them to life. You know what they do? Fish them out of the water. Watch them waltzing around, rolling on barrels, Bring those brats to me. Allan! Marjorie! - You want me, sir? - I do! Here she is, Father. Oh, there she is. Now, what's been going on between you two? - Well, he... - Don't tell me! I know. And it's got to stop. I tell you both. I forbid this lovemaking. I forbid this mooning about. I have other plans for my granddaughter, son. I'm ashamed of you, miss. - You're opportunists, that's what you are. - Opportunists? - That's what I said. - What do you mean, Grandfather? I mean that this country hereabouts has, I'll admit, a romantic atmosphere. Nature made it that way. But that doesn't mean that you are to regard it... as a stimulus for forbidden lovemaking. - But Grandfather... - And the trees and the flowers hereabouts.. you are to regard merely as trees and flowers. Nature's adornments, not as a background for your puppy love. - We were only... - Grandfather! And the birds! The birds have other things to do... besides seeing you into a state of silly sentimentality. They have their nests to take care of, their eggs to hatch! Their young to feed. They're not placed there merely for your romantic benefits. - And as for the, the, the... what? - The bees. Yes, the bees! And I've heard the function of the bees misinterpreted by you. Their purpose is to make honey. Their buzzing is incidental to that task... and not an obligatto to your callow and mock expression. Do you understand me? There will be no lovemaking between your granddaughter and myself, I promise you. It pleases me, sir, that you can be swayed by reason. And you, miss, am I to continue to be ashamed of you, or will you too give me your promise? But, Grandfather, I told you that I didn't like him, that I hated him. And now you accuse me of... Leave her alone, Helen. That's all, young man. Well, you are unpleasant, if I must say. You made us all feel very uncomfortable. I don't know how you feel. I feel like a rubber of bridge. - Claude... - Cabot, you're mad! Oh, get away, get away. Henry, I wish you wouldn't leave fingerprints on the cards. Claude can probably advise you how to avoid that. I wouldn't let him make me cry if I were you. I wasn't crying. I've got a bad cold. Is that why you're lying on the damp ground with your face on the wet grass? Probably and old Barr custom for curing colds. What a temper for an old man. He's as nutty as a peanut bar. It's all my fault. Beastly clocks. I got you into this. No, you didn't. It isn't the clocks. It's something else. I don't know what. I suppose I haven't any sense. Sense? You're the only one in the whole family that's got any sense. - That's my tray. - That's a surprise. Sheer luck. When the foolish observe the conquest of the wise... they call it luck. That's from a Chinese. If it isn't from the Chinese, it turns out it might be. What did you mean when you said you'd hoped that she'd do something desperate? Here they are. Oh, Marjorie, dear. Allan, I've been so worried. According to Culbertson, a dummy should be seen and not heard. I don't know what suit to discard. Oh, come, come, Helen. The wrong one, my dear. All right, made them. We're homicidal now, Henry. Extraordinary luck. There ought to be some punishment for forced profits at bridge. Now what's the score? Grandfather. Grandfather. Allan and I have something important to tell you. We're going to get married and you're not going to stop us. Shhh! It worked! Henry! Ring up long distance. Boston. Beacon 27400. I'm going to change my will. You mean you're not angry, Grandfather? Well, of all things! Long distance? I want Boston, please. Beacon 27400. Claude. You know the wall safe in my bedroom. There's a legal-looking document there. Looks very much like your old pardon, but it isn't. Bring it here to me. Hello... hello! Oh, Mr. Johnson. Yes, please... Hello, Mr. Johnson? Well, I'm ready to change my will. Yes, I'm here at the summer camp. But I don't think I need to trouble you to come down after all. Here's what I want to tell you. My present will is made out in favor of my son Judd. Draw up a new one. I'm going to leave the bulk of my property to my granddaughter Marjorie Barr... and her husband Allan Barr. Blaine, sir. Yes, I said Allan Barr, never mind who Allan Barr is. Blaine, sir, my name is Blaine. Yes, yes, Johnson, there is an Allan Barr, at least there will be one very shortly. - Who does he mean? - You. Yes, and receive a full benefit of the estate... And at their death be parted to their first son, who will be named Cabot Barr. One moment, sir. No, Judd has merely the same proportion as the other members of my family. - Just a moment, sir. - Hold on, Justin. What is it, what is it? You must have meant me when you spoke of Marjorie's husband. - But you called me Allan Barr. - That's what you're going to be. - Oh no, sir. - Didn't you tell him? I forgot. You're going to change your name to Barr. Oh no, I'm not. Not I. Not you? What's wrong with the name of Barr? Nothing's wrong with it. It just doesn't happen to be my name. Oh, I suppose you think your name's important, sir. - Just as important as Barr. - Oh, Grandfather. Must he change his name? I mean, if he doesn't want to. Isn't that silly? What was that word you used, miss? I mean, isn't it enough that I love him and he loves me? You're a renegade! You made an agreement with me and now you back out of it. This young upstart, a perfect stranger, means more to you than my wishes. Than money, family, blood. - Is that your final decision, sir? - Yes, sir. Very well. Hello, Johnson! Did you take down everything I told you? Well you can cut it out. You're losing a great deal by this, sir. I know that. I'm losing your money. And you'll lose Marjorie too, if I have anything to say about it. Only her mother has the right to say that. And what does her mother say? I never harass my daughter. She must do as she sees fit. Oh, so you're against me too. And of course you're on the side of your puppy. Well, I can't help admiring Allan's flair. Nuisance, that's what it is! I wish you wouldn't excite yourself, Cabot. I'll excite myself as much as I please. And now let me tell you all something. In this will my money goes to Judd... with the exception of large gifts for all of you. There you are! I'm going to change my will and every penny I have goes to Judd... and you can all go to the devil. What are you doing here? Broke again, I suppose. No. I want to know why you've come up here and told me nothing about it. You don't invite me so I came up. Sounds like a very reasonable statement. I don't invite you so you came up. Well, I'll let that pass. For once you've come at the right moment. I have an important announcement to make to you. I know, you've changed your will. - I have. - Well, you see? Well, I'm not going to stand for it. I'm your only son and therefore your only heir. Go on, you have something more to say, haven't you? Well, I have. This is Professor Schumaker. I brought him up here to examine you. Examine me? What is he, a policeman? Professor Schumaker is an alienist. And if you refuse to submit to his examination, Well, that's all right, we'll... - Judd, you ungrateful... - How can you do such a thing? You wish Professor Schumaker to examine me... to determine whether or not I am sane, eh? - Yes. - Very well. Where would you like to begin? Wait, you can't, Father. What's the matter with you all? Afraid I am a lunatic? Please sit down, Professor. Sit down, Judd. Well, begin, Professor. You understand, sir, this will be a completely fair test. I don't intend saving your son's opinions. I shall draw my own conclusions. Very sporting of you. Well, Mr. Barr, we'll do routine questions first. - How do you sleep nights? - On my stomach, sir, since I was a baby. I mean, Mr. Barr, do you sleep well or badly? Well, very well. Except when I sleep badly, then I sleep very badly. - Do you ever hear voices? - Almost constantly. You do? Surrounded as I am by an exceedingly garrulous family, and having excellent hearing, it would be extraordinary, Professor, if I didn't hear voices. I can perfectly understand that, sir. Have you ever suffered from epilepsy Mr. Barr? Not mele. But there have been epileptics in your family. Well, my son Judd used to throw terrific fits when he was a child. - Now look here! - I remember once... his nurse dropped him on his head when he was a year old. Purposefully, I think. Well, when we thought it was an accident we discharged the girl. You... you're trying to make a fool of me, Father. I am, Judd, and succeeding, I think. Carry on, Professor. Are you troubled with nightmares? If you'll pardon me, Professor, there was no need to ask that question. You've met my son. Now let me ask you some questions. Is it not true... that mentally unbalanced persons... invariably accuse others of being insane? As a rule they do. And that they labor under the delusion of persecution? That is so. Well, sir, note. That my son Judd had fits, that he accuses me of being insane, that he's under the delusion that I'm not leaving him my money, when, as a matter of fact, here is my will, made out in his favor. Professor Shumaker, I expect to call you very shortly... to consult with you about having my son placed in an asylum. - Good day, sir. - A good day to you. And thank you for a very entertaining afternoon. I regret, Mr. Barr, that you were subjected to this. Father, I consider that I was perfectly justified in bringing Professor Shumaker here... but now I'll not proceed any further with the matter. Go home, Judd, and don't come to see me again. Not while I'm still alive. - What's the matter, Cabot? - What is it, Cabot? I don't know. For about the first time in my life I feel old. Oh, Father. I don't quite know how old I am. Henry knows. But I'm nearly eighty. And I suppose this blow is rather more than I can endure. I knew Judd was a waster. Incompetent, lacking in principle, but I never thought he was a scoundrel. He had the Barr blood. He is my only son. And he's a thieving scoundrel. Cabot. Thanks, Henry. I'm getting old. Remember, white satin, Augusta. - Henry. - Yes, Cabot. Place two chairs there... for Marjorie and Allan. - Augusta. - Yes, Cabot? Sit there. What is all this, Cabot? And Helen beside her. Yes, Father. That's all right, Augusta. Henry. Stand at the back there. And Claude on my right. Now, listen all of you. You know how I feel about dying. You know I regard it as a rather unpleasant adventure. I have said it's a very solemn occasion. And so it is. But at Lovesy's memorial service... we all had a hilarious time. We tried not to show it, but we were having the time of our lives. And I determined then... that that's the sort of memorial service I shall like to have. when... when I'm gone. Grandfather! Well, you can help me to the door again. I'm tired and I'm going to lie down. Henry. Come to my room presently. I have some instructions for you. And bring Claude. Augusta. All your life you've been wanting me to see a doctor. Well, you can send for one now. Bless and rest his soul. Claude. Claude! Coming, sir. - Are all the clocks stopped, Claude? - Yes, sir. I was just up in his bedroom, sir. There was all his clothes hanging in the cupboard looking so... so empty-like without him wearing it. Poor old Mr. Barr. What you really mean is poor what he left behind. Cabot had an almost ideally happy death. Slept out of one life into another. Wish it for all of us, Claude. - Is there anything I can do, sir. - Just check this. Now, this is where Helen is to sit, isn't it? Yes, sir, here. Mrs. Pritchard here. Mr. Judd and his wife in the center. And the young folks here. Just as he had it arranged in the mirror. - You remember, sir. - Yes, I remember. And none of them have any idea, you think. Oh no, sir, I'm quite sure not. - You know what you have to do? - Yes, sir. And you too, sir. Fancy his insisting on all those rehearsals. - Weak as he was. - Six of them. And the final one the night before he died. And how he did enjoy it. - There was a man, Claude. - Yes indeed, sir. You would have your joke, wouldn't you, Cabot? Even after death. Who are you talking to, Henry? I.. I was talking to Claude. Well, it sounded as if you were addressing Cabot. Nonsense. I don't like all this hocus-pocus, there's something spooky about it. Let go of that chair. That's not your seat anyway. What do you mean it isn't my seat? Why are we all supposed to sit in certain places? - What are you up to, Henry Loring? - Me, nothing. Cabot's orders. I don't like the way you say that. Sounds exactly as though he was still here. If I hadn't seen him dead and buried... Well, he got his white satin. And looked very peaceful, Augusta. Peaceful and mischievous. There was a look on his face. I've always felt that Cabot stood between death and me. Now I'm alone. Henry, I'm frightened. There's nothing to be frightened about. I'm a fool, Henry. Don't cry, Augusta. Cabot would rather have us laugh than cry. He was that way, you know. Where have you two children been? We ran over to the... We took some flowers. I wanted to say hello too. Marjorie. I know it isn't mourning, Mother. But Grandfather liked this dress. I'm sure he'd rather I wore it. I'm sure he would. Helen. You are to sit here. And Marjorie and Allan here. Augusta, you're sitting in the wrong chair. I'm very comfortable here. If you don't move to that one there will be no will. Oh, Henry, don't be ridiculous. Henry, you're very cruel! Do I have to stay for the reading? I think you'd better, dear. What's the matter, Cabot expected you to. I'd rather not. Oh, it's so beastly. What's beastly, child? Money, Grandfather's money. I can't bear the thought about waiting to find out what money he left us. What does it matter? I understand, dear. Good afternoon. Hello. Well, it's 2 o'clock, where's the lawyer? Who's going to read the will? It will be read, Judd, it will be read! You will be good enough not to speak to me in that bossy way, Loring. Remember, I'm the son and heir. - Well, you're sitting in the wrong chair. - What's the matter with it? My chair. You sit here. And, Retta, sit here, please. And don't move your chairs a fraction of an inch. Cabot's orders. Now sit down, all of you, in your proper chairs. Why are those curtains drawn? You'll see presently, Judd. Cabot's orders. The whole thing is getting more and more confusing. - Oh, pardon me. - For what? For speaking to you. I hadn't meant to. I dislike you intensely. - Humph! - You too, Retta. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. Well, I guess we can begin. All right, Claude. Yes, sir. Why are you darkening the room? What is this? Oh, my goodness. They're not going to have a s?ance. Cabot's orders, Augusta. It's very mysterious to confound folks at this time of the day. Look here, Loring, I came to hear the will read... not to waste my time with all this mumbo jumbo. Sit down, Judd. And keep quiet, all of you. - What is that thing, Henry? - I don't like this, Judd, I'm leaving. Sit down, Retta! Cabot's orders. Good evening, everybody. Oh, my goodness! No, Henry, no, I can't bear it! Control yourself, Augusta. Nothing to be nervous about. How are you, Judd? Is... is this the will? Uh, this is my last will and testament. Did that go off as rehearsed, Henry? Did I get the reaction right? - Perfectly, Cabot. - Good. Oh, by the way, I hope none of you object to this being a little informal. But it's so much cozier, don't you think? - Comfortable, everybody? - Yes, Father. Oh, Henry. Augusta's doctor took away my cigars. Oh, I'm sorry if I'm wasting your time, Judd. I know you're a busy man. That didn't go off quite entirely according to schedule. Well, here we are. Barrs all of us. With one stubborn exception. Oh, Claude, about those clocks. They're stopped, sir. - Sure? - Quite sure, sir. You're positive Augusta hasn't started them all again as she did the last time? I didn't last time, you know I didn't. Oh, my goodness, I'm talking to that screen as though Cabot was still here. - I think she protests, Henry? - She did, Cabot. Ah, good! A little indignation stirs up the liver, my dear. You're a rogue, Cabot. I mean, you were a rogue. He was a rogue, wasn't he? And now, to the unpleasant duty of distributing my belongings. Incidentally, there's one great advantage in being dead. You can't any of you talk back at me. Oh, dear. Now... Augusta! Where's your handkerchief? Oh... I'm afraid I've lost it, Cabot. Oh, I thought so. Well, I'm leaving you the family jewels. And to provide for your future weepy period, ten dozen very fine lace handkerchiefs. You'll find them handsome and at the same time practical. Both show and blow. - How did that joke go over, Henry? - Like a ball of fire. Good, I thought they might have heard it before. It's a very old one. - Are you enjoying this, Judd? - I don't think this is funny. Maybe it's because I haven't the sense of humor. No, Judd, I didn't think you would enjoy it. - How are you, Helen? - Splendid, Father. You're not having hysterics at seeing me again, are you? No, I'm delighted. Helen... Have you forgiven me for my pigheadedness all those years? Yes, Father. I hope she said yes, Henry. Helen, I'm leaving you the house and the furniture. - Thank you, Father. - I'm your servant, my dear. Henry, to you... I leave my cellar, including all my 1812 brandy. You probably expected that. That's why you tried to prevent me drinking. Yes, that's why I did it, Cabot, thank you very much. Claude, to you I leave my clothes, a small annuity and $5,000 in cash. Thank you very much, sir. Not at all, Claude. You've been more than a good servant, you've been a good friend. Twenty years ago you promised never to betray the trust I placed in you... and you kept your word. And now we come to the root of all legal. In other words, the bulk of my estate. Judd, you hurt me very much. In many ways. But what hurt me most, my son, was that little black book of yours. How did you know about that? - You must have said something. - I did nothing of the kind. Then how could he possibly have known? If he's finished protesting, Henry, continue writing. Yes, I knew about it all along. That list of my eccentricities which you wrote down. All right, Father, I admit. But you... Oh, why do keep addressing that picture as though he were alive? I never knew why you did that... until the day you brought that alienist... in an effort to prove me of unsound mind. Well, he was. Then I knew why you kept that disgraceful and unfilial record... and I was ashamed of you. For that reason, I'm going to cut you off with the proverbial shilling, which at the present rate of exchange... it's somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty cents. So this is a dirty trick. I might have known he had something up his sleeve, the old devil. But I'm not through yet. This isn't legal! I have the real will right here. Stop acting violently, Judd. I know this is not a legal form for a will. But my lawyer has everything legally drawn, and signed, and sealed. And that will that you have in your inside pocket is valueless. I've had enough of this! I'm going. Before you go, Judd... I hope he's going off all right, Henry. Before you go, I want you to hear this. I'm relenting. I'm leaving you more than a shilling. I'm leaving you the clocks and the peacocks. And now, if everything has gone out according to planned, Judd and Retta have left, and I am alone with those who love me. - Allan. - Yes, sir? You're sorry you didn't comply with my request and become a Barr when I was alive. - How did you know that? - Marjorie has already forgiven you. He knew I'd do that. To you, my children, who will shortly become Mr. and Mrs. Allan Barr, Yes, sir. - He didn't object to that, did he, Henry? - No, Cabot, he seems pleased. Hm, good. And then, to you, Mr. and Mrs. Allan Barr, I leave my name, my possessions, and my special love. It's your love I wanted, Grandfather. Thank you. And now, my dears, and by that I mean all of you, Helen, Augusta, Allan, Marjorie, you, Henry, and you too, Claude, to all of you, my final goodbye. I'm going to taste that other bottle of wine. That finer vintage which waits for me beyond. It's been a pleasure and a privilege being alive with you. It will be my hope to meet you all again in due time. God bless you.
