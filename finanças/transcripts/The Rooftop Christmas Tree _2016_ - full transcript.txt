Come on. Chilly, huh? It's a little cold, yeah. Just watch your step there, it's awfully slippery. Oh, it's so nice to have you home. You know, I can't believe it's been three years since we spent Christmas together. Neither can I. Sounds like that law firm really kept you hopping up there. That's how they do things at Chandler, Abbott and Jonas. Always on call, 24/7 even holidays. You know, we're really sorry to hear about you and Richard. You two seemed so happy together. Richard's a very nice guy. It just turned out, we wanted different things in life. So, when's that truck supposed to get here with the rest of your stuff? Day after tomorrow. You know, you could stay here. I mean, your old room's just sitting up there. Thanks, Mom, but I'm pretty sure my old room isn't the best place to start my own practice. She's got a point, Abby. Well, you can't blame me for trying. But I found a great place right in town. It's not far, and it even has a spare bedroom I can use as an office until I get things going. That's gonna be quite a change for ya' from that hotshot law firm in D.C. Believe me, Dad, I've had enough swimming with sharks to last a lifetime. Well, all you've gotta do is sit back, relax and let us spoil you a little bit. Thank you. At least until you're ready to hang out your shingle. So, what do you think? I think we're ready. All set.

A week before Christmas like clockwork, it's the same thing every year. I used to love it when I was little. From my bedroom at night, it looked like the tree was floating up there, like some sort of beacon. Should I help him? Since when has Dale Landis ever let anybody help him put up that tree? Dale, you're gonna break your fool neck one of these days. We should have bought that man a net years ago. Either that or a trampoline. I think it looks nice. What I don't understand, is why he keeps doing it year after year. I mean, he knows darn well what's gonna happen. It's like he doesn't care. He doesn't. ♪ ♪ Where did all these people come from?

When we were in school, who knew you could cook? So good to have you home for Christmas. Your parents must be over the moon. You have no idea. Come on, so like, how's it going. Tell me everything, you okay? Yeah, yeah. You know. No regrets leaving that fast track law firm of yours? It was time. You hear from Richard? Ughh, let's just say, that ship has sailed. Then maybe I'll keep an eye out to find you a new shipmate. Uh, I'm actually on an extended leave of absence from the rocky world of romance, so thanks, but no thanks. Okay, I'll just have to cook you a five-star meal instead. I like where this is going. If you need anything, anything at all, just ask. Thanks, Jess. Come on, let's sit down. ♪ I have seen you stare at that Courthouse in exactly the same way since you were a little girl. Judge Conner. For all these years, I wondered what mysteries were hidden behind those bright young eyes of yours? No mysteries. Just the same questions. As long as you're never satisfied with the same old answers. You haven't changed a bit. And you are a sight for sore eyes. How are you, Judge? Well, I'm okay except I seem to be the last person on earth to find out you're moving home. Oh well, I was gonna come by. Yeah and that you've left Chandler, Abbott and Jonas to open your own practice? I see my parents have been talking to you. Well, as matter of fact, I got a call from Carl Jonas. Your old boss asked if I would try and talk you out of leaving. Mr. Jonas called you himself? Well, he seemed to think you've got a promising future with his firm. According to him, they were gonna renew your contract, with a promotion? It was a good offer. Which you declined. What did you tell him? Well, I told him that if my favorite young protégé turned down his offer, she must have a pretty good reason. It wasn't about the money. With you, it never was. Now look, I'm due in court. Why don't you come by my chambers tomorrow and we'll talk more. I'd like that. All right, I'll get Marcie to phone over to the diner, order in sandwiches.

I forgot how much I missed your cooking. Wait till you see what's on the menu for Christmas dinner. I assume you've invited the entire town again? Your mother cut back this year, she's only inviting half the town. Ha-ha, you two. I saw a someone posting a notice on Dale Landis' door today. He had a police officer with him. They didn't waste much time, did they? What's going on? He's from the city. He was serving Dale with a court order to take that tree down. What? Why? They say it's a building code violation. And a serious fire hazard, which makes it a danger to him and everyone else in the neighborhood. Dale Landis has been putting that tree on his roof every year since I was 9 years old. A lot's changed since last time you were home for dinner, sweetie. Changed? How? Well, when you were growing up, nobody minded that Dale put a tree on his roof. You know, it looked nice, and it didn't hurt anyone. But back then everyone in the neighborhood knew Dale. So, even if he didn't talk about it much, we all had a pretty good idea just how difficult it was for him around the holidays, without his family. I remember that night when his family left. I felt so sad for him. He just looked so-- Lost. He was, honey. He still is. What do you mean? Dale's had less and less to say in the last few years. He hardly leaves that house. It's starting to fall down around him. The only time that we're sure to see him is when Christmas comes around, and he puts that tree up. The man just wants to be left alone. But we've had a lot of people move into the neighborhood and they're nice and cordial. But you know, they don't really know Dale. Every year that tree goes up and it starts up all over again. Someone complains. And even if they don't, I'm pretty sure that Dale is on the city's radar by now. They show up with that court order like clockwork. And he has to take the tree down. Not exactly. What? He won't take it down. But it's a court order. Either he takes that tree down, or he could wind up in-- Yep. Wait. Seriously? Mhm. The last three years, Dale Landis has spent Christmas in jail. And by the sounds of it, that's where he's headed again. Over a Christmas tree? But, why? Well, nobody knows. Well, has anyone asked him? Oh, sure. I mean, every year when he appears in court, Sam Conner asks him the same question. And he gets the same answer. Because he "likes the way it looks". That makes absolutely no sense. It does to Dale. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Come on, Barney, he admitted he was in the car. Exactly. Doesn't matter if he was sleeping. He woke up when his buddies got back in.

Hey Dad, do you ever miss being a lawyer? Honey, that was 20 years ago. I know, but do you ever regret leaving law? I suppose if I miss anything, it's that feeling when everything comes together, you know? When the system works and you feel like you really made a difference. Yeah. Mmm. Something on your mind, Sarah? I was just thinking about something you said, I must've been 9 or 10? It was Christmas, and I asked you if you didn't like being a lawyer anymore. You said-- You said you found something you liked better. Something that made you happy. Yeah, that was a big leap of faith. What do you mean? I wanted to build furniture. This is what makes me happy. You know? Being a lawyer was-- well, I didn't have the passion for it. Not like you do. So there I was, walking away from a job. Your mother and I had to start over again, risking our home, our future. Were you nervous? I was petrified. I'm not gonna kid you, times were tough for a while, we really had to tighten our belts. A lot of people thought I was crazy when I set up out here. But how can you be sure? That you made the right choice? You can't. Not completely.

No, what you really wanted from me was for me to ask you why you were gonna become a lawyer. Hmm? Even back then, you weren't afraid of the hard questions. Yeah, as I recall, you didn't pull any punches either. Well, from that day forward, I never have. Not with you. Something tells me we're not just taking a walk down memory lane here, are we?

What do you mean? I never set out to change the world, judge. I just wanted to make a difference, for the better. Well, you have made a difference. You gave your clients their day in court, helped them find justice. But that's just it. The longer I do this, the more I realize, it isn't about justice or what's right. It's about winning. Hmm. Sometimes it can feel like that, yeah. What are we supposed to do? I-- I'm not naive, I know the law is never black and white. But that gray area just keeps getting bigger, we keep trading off and compromising, making deals that sometimes, they don't even make sense. How am I supposed to explain that to someone who has put their faith in me? How am I supposed to just sit back and watch while these good people are made to feel that their day in court was just a lot of haggling? It's not justice. And it's not right. And I'm tired of it. Why did you leave Chandler Abbott? A woman and her children were being kicked out of their apartment. The owner wanted to covert the building into a co-op, she couldn't afford it and I wanted to take the case. I thought I could stall him at least long enough so they wouldn't be on the street for Christmas. Was the eviction legal? It's Christmas, Judge. She has three kids and nowhere to go. Counselor. Of course, it was legal. The owner was our client. You wanted to take a case against your own law firm? Technically. Yes but I would've done it on my own time. Pro Bono. And of course, they said no. So, you quit? It wasn't just that case, Judge. I've been feeling this way for a long time and I couldn't stay there anymore. I don't even know if I can-- If you can what? I don't even know if I can do this anymore. I don't know if I can be a lawyer. I see. I hope-- I hope that you're not too disappointed in me? You have been blessed with a rare gift, Sarah. A good heart and a legal mind and that's what makes you a very fine lawyer and an even better person. You could never disappoint me. But the hardest part of what we do is to finally admit to ourselves that we can't save everyone. Right now, I would be happy with saving just one. Maybe that's what's brought you home again. What? Looking for that one case, that one client to restore your faith. I wish I could believe that. But it 's the season for believing. What better time to find out?

Yeah, well-- I mean, people don't just walk away from Chandler, Abbott and Jonas. I mean, 'that place is mythic, People are lined up around the block to get jobs there. So, why would anyone leave all that just to move back here? I don't know, why would anyone trade all this, to go work there? What? Yeah well, I mean, don't get me wrong. I can see the appeal.

Oh, hey, I passed your neighbor on the way over here. Mr. Landis? Yeah, been a while since I've seen him out on his bicycle. Probably about a year? What do you mean? Remember, when we said that Dale doesn't get out much anymore? So if he's riding into town at Christmas, he's headed for the courthouse. Because of the tree? Once the order goes on his door, he has 48 hours to take the tree down. If he doesn't, he has to appear in court. And he always shows up. And he always says no. Do you mean Judge Conners is gonna put him in jail today? No, Sam will give him a few more days to think about it. Not that it makes any difference. Well, what does his attorney say? Dale doesn't have a lawyer. Says he doesn't need one. Wait, what? Sam tried to assign him a public defender but he wanted no part of it. How can he understand what's happening without an attorney? That's like asking to go to jail. Which some people believe is the whole point, that he's just a lonely man looking for attention. Others think there's really something wrong with him. That he's not all there anymore. Well, what do you think? I think every Christmas story should have a happy ending. I just don't think that's this one's gonna turn out.

And a Merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas, sir. It wouldn't be Christmas without a visit from you to our courtroom, would it? No, sir, I guess not.

And I take it you have no intention of doing so. No, sir. I won't be doing that. Yeah. I gather that you have once again decided to appear in court without benefit of counsel?

If you don't take the tree down, I have to put you in jail. Ah, yeah. I understand, Sir. Okay. Alright. Mr. Keaton. It's all yours. Thank you, your honour. In the matter of the town of Rosedale versus Dale Landis, the defendant is accused of being in violation of the following town and county codes. Uhh, Mr. Keaton, most of us here have been down this road a few times. Why don't we just stipulate the violations, and we can move it along a bit? Yes, sir. Alright. For the past three years, the defendant has ignored identical court orders to comply with the town's building and security codes. We don't think this is gonna be any different this year. Agreed. The people request an immediate court date for Mr. Landis, and a fine of $5,000 for each day that the tree remains on his roof. That's a little steep, don't you think? Your honour, this has been going on for four years now. I think it's about time the defendant took it seriously. Mr. Landis, you do understand that this Christmas tree of yours could end up being very expensive? I don't have any money, your Honour. Well, then I suggest you take the tree down. I'm sorry. I can't do that. Why not? Your Honour, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but I just like the way the tree looks up there.

It's-- It's a Christmas tree, Mr. Keaton. It's a matter of public safety, your Honour. I'll take it under advisement. Mr. Landis, the Clerk will assign you a court date, at which time I will rule on Mr. Keaton's motion.

The fact that the defendant's your neighbor doesn't change a thing. Look, there has to be more going on here. I know Dale Landis isn't crazy. He's been breaking these laws for years, it doesn't seem to matter to him. Sure it matters. So he doesn't mind spending Christmas in jail? Of course not. He would just rather spend Christmas in jail than take down his tree. And this to you sounds like the decision of a rational man? It's a zoning code, okay? It's not like he robbed a bank. It's the law. And as long as I'm in that courtroom, my job is to enforce that law. It's not that simple. It couldn't be simpler, right is right and wrong is wrong.

He wants you to represent him? Let's just say, we've come to an understanding? And would this understanding involve him taking that tree down and staying out of jail? I think first I need to figure out why he puts it up. I've waited a long time to solve that little Christmas mystery. Has he ever mentioned his family in court? Not that I recall. He has a son, doesn't he? Danny. He moved away with his mother when he was very young. I tried to look him up on-line, but there's no record of a Daniel Landis from Rosedale. No way of knowing where he is, or even if he's alive or dead. Why are you trying to find him? This man has no one, Judge Conner, he's all alone and I thought if I could just find someone, a family member, someone he could trust, he might listen to them.

Thank you! ♪ Okay. ♪ ♪ No drivers license, no credit card, no e-mail, no contact person. It's like outside of Christmas, he doesn't exist. Hi. Hey, umm, sorry, I'm just in the middle of something here. Yeah, I figured that. Hot fresh Cider. You've been here for hours, you worked right through dinner. I did, jeez. Thought you might need a break, Hang on a second, how do you know how long I've been in here? Ae you following me now or something? As fascinating as you may be, no, I haven't been watching you. I thought umm, maybe-- Umm-- Never mind. Bad idea. Hang on, I-- I just get a little cranky when I'm hungry. Hmm, I had a feeling, so-- Hold this. ♪ Tuna salad, right? How did you--? I sometimes eat at the diner and I overheard Marcie take your order the other day. Apparently, you have a long history of tuna salad sandwiches. Thank you. Umm, why are you doing this? Those Landis' files? Yeah. Yeah, about the other day umm, I didn't mean to lecture you on the law. Especially when it comes to Mr. Landis. I know he's more than just another case for you. I got a little caught up. I do that sometimes. I'm sorry. Thank you. I-- Get a little caught up sometimes too. Really? You noticed. Yeah. You know, when I'm in that courtroom, I have to do everything I can to win that case, you know that. Including this one. I do. And you have to do everything you can to help out your client. So things are gonna get kinda sticky before this is over. Yeah, and when they do, I just want you to remember that this sandwich is a token of our professional respect. Okay. And that I envy your faith in other people. You do? Yeah I might be a pretty good lawyer, but I don't have much luck in that department. Especially at Christmas. ♪ You want half? We don't discuss the case. Agreed. Okay. Goodnight, Barney. Good one. Sometimes they don't toast the bread enough depends on the chef that day. Hmm. ♪ I mean, we were together all through law school, it was fine. But I should have seen it coming, the signs were all there. Such as? She took a job in D.C. the day after we graduated, and then stopped returning my texts and calls. Ouch. Yeah, should've realized at that time our days were numbered. And since then? Since then? Well, it turns out not everyone relates to my love for small town life. Mmm. Working in a place like Rosedale doesn't exactly fit their visions of success. They don't know what they're missing. How about you? No one to keep the home fires burning? No, I gave up on that. Oh, please. I mean, not as a permanent situation. It's just dating in the city is way too exhausting. Like the past four years have been all about money and titles and connections and winning. Mostly winning. No matter what. "Guys like me" in other words? Nothing like you. You know, that may be the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. Well, this is me. So umm, guess I'll see you in court tomorrow. Yeah. ♪ Good night. Good night. Sarah? And what I said before, about that sandwich? I meant it. ♪ I'm impressed. You got your first case already. Yeah, only on the condition that I do and say nothing to keep my client out of jail. He'll change his tune. Mmm, I wouldn't be so sure. How can he say no to the best lawyer in town-- Who's doing it for free, I might add. The same way he's said no everyone else. And, you know, as for being the best, the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney is no slouch. Believe me. So, you've met John Keaton. Oh, you know him? Not exactly. He comes into my restaurant sometimes. So he has good taste too. Why, thank you, it's all very mysterious though. What do you mean? Whenever he comes in, he's always with the same attractive young woman. - Really? - Mhm. She must be from out of town, I assume. That's the only time I ever see her. That would makes sense. He hasn't lived in our little town very long and he doesn't realize that people notice these things. I'm sure you're right. All rise. Be seated. Ms. Wright. I see you've joined us. Welcome, as always. Thank you, your Honour. Well, let's get right to it, shall we? Dale, I don't suppose you've given us an early Christmas present by taking that tree down? Uhh, no, your Honour, I haven't. And I gather you still have no intention of doing so. No, sir. Hmm, Mr. Keaton. Your honour, upon further review, the prosecution has decided to withdraw the motion to fine Mr. Landis everyday the tree is on top of his house. Well, I like the way this is starting out. So noted. Did you get that, Dale? The prosecution is dropping the fine? I appreciate it. However, the defendant continues to be in violation of several building codes and in so doing presents a clear danger to himself and to the community. I would never hurt anybody, you honour. No one, really, never. Ehh, Dale, let him finish. Therefore, your Honour, we ask that you rule on our request for immediate psychiatric evaluation to determine the competency of the defendant, as well as authorize the immediate enforcement of the court order to take the tree down. Dale you understand that one way or the other, that tree is coming down. I really wish you wouldn't do that, your honour. With all due respect, your honour, the defendant's wishes have no relevance here. Your Honour, the wishes of the defendant are precisely what this case is all about. Your Honour, excuse me, if I could finish my point--? It was Mr. Landis' wish to place the tree on his roof, it was his wish to keep it on his roof. Then it must have also been his wish to break the law. The Prosecution has made it clear that this case is no longer just about the law. It is also about the defendant's understanding of the law. I understand the law just fine, your Honour. I just don't wanna take down my tree. I-I think they're on to something else here, Dale. They seem pretty steamed about it. Oh yes, they do. You honour, I'm confused, who am I speaking to here? Is Mr. Landis representing himself, or is Ms. Wright now arguing this case? Fair question, Ms. Wright? Mr. Landis has agreed to let me assist him, your honour. What does that mean? In the case of Dooley vs. The State of Washington, Raymond Dooley declined to be represented by an attorney. What? However, when his competency was questioned, the court ruled that while he had the right to refuse representation, he could be assigned an advisor. An "advisor"? You mean something like, an attorney? They weren't there to represent him, they were there to interpret. And uhh, clarify. The law, so to speak. What's the difference? It's right there, read it for yourself. I don't have to read it, you're talking about semantics. Excuse me? Look you're either his lawyer or you're not. Doesn't make any sense. It makes more sense than putting him back in jail, doesn't it? He knew he was gonna go there when he put the tree back up. Well, at least he didn't make up stories about his tree to try and impress people! Excuse me? You two, in my chamber now, this court's in recess, ten minutes. ♪ Okay, what was that all about? You think I'm making up stories about something? I think you would do anything to win this case. I'm not the one pulling rabbits out of my hat, "Dooley vs. State of Washington"? Please. Are you questioning my citation? I'm questioning your cheap shot. Alright. Neutral corners. Your Honour, she's obviously trying to help her neighbour, whether he wants it or not. Do you even know what we're talking about here? Have you been to see the tree? What's that got to do with anything? Your Honour, Dale Landis has been putting a tree on his roof since I was a little girl. I used to look forward to seeing it from my bedroom window every year. Wait, how long has this guy been getting away with this? The point is, what he does may be technically illegal-- "Technically"? It is also beautiful. And in some way that none of us can understand, it makes him happy. But that does not make him crazy. And I will not let the prosecution make him think he is. Your Honour, the law clearly states-- I'm familiar with the law, Mr. Keaton. But you're right. The law is quite clear on this point. But your Honour-- However, Ms. Wright has also made a point. Whatever the legal issues here, Mr. Landis is harmless. Which leads me to believe that we must be missing something, that there must be a different solution. Such as? No idea. Which is why I'm putting you in charge of finding that solution. - You are? - Mhm. And, you're gonna help her John. Woah, woah, wait, what? You two are gonna work this out together. And the next time I see you, I want to hear that you've found a way to satisfy the court's and Mr. Landis' dreams for a happy and healthy Christmas. Wait a second-- If you two put half as much effort into sorting this out as you do into sniping at each other, you're gonna bring a lot of Christmas cheer into my courtroom! Your Honour, I have a full case load. For which, I will give you a full continuance. Hmm? Your only concern right now is to create a Christmas miracle. Any questions? Good. Tomorrow is Christmas Eve. I want this resolved before then. Otherwise, Mr. Landis spends another Christmas in jail. And we don't want that, do we? I really think-- Sir-- No, sir. Alright. Off you go. Play nice. "Play nice"? He was talking to you. You wanna tell me what I did? Let's just get through this. Fine. Any ideas? You? Mm-mm. I'll get the files. I'll get the coffee. ♪ Okay, you want neighbors' complaints or building codes? Well, it's your neighborhood. I'll take the building codes. Okay. ♪ ♪ Non-fat latte.

John is the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney. These are my parents. Nice to meet you. Keaton. Judge Conners tells me you're handling Dale Landis' case. That's right. You've got your hands full there. Yeah, well we're actually handling it together now, try to straighten things out. Sarah, did you convince Dale into letting you be his lawyer? No, not exactly. It was the judge's idea actually, to try and keep Mr. Landis from spending another Christmas in jail. Well, I hope it works. Yeah, so do we. Uhh, you know, I should-- there's something I need to take care of. Excuse me. I'll come by tomorrow. Love you. Honey, they're gonna light the tree. What was that all about?

My sister's what brought me to Rosedale, she was the reason I took the job. What do you mean? Well, our family moved around so much, it was umm, it felt like it was just her and I. And I was the big brother, so I had to take care of her. What about your parents? They made sure we were okay. In a sort of uhh-- how do you say, non-committal sort of way. What? I guess looking back on it, they liked the idea of kids a lot more than the actual day to day reality. John, that must have been so hard for you and your sister. Yeah. But it did give me a lot of time to figure things out. And I figured out pretty quickly that if someone says "trust me," you gotta watch your back. That's not always true, you know. Yeah, maybe not. But when you're a little kid looking after your little sister, the first thing you learn is that no one's gonna hand you what you need. You gotta-- You gotta go out there and get it. You know, I guess that's kinda stuck with me over the years. Especially when it comes to Emily. So, you came here so she would know what it felt like, to have a real home. Yeah. You know, you remind me of her. Really? She has a lot of faith in people too. Well, why wouldn't she? She had you. I guess it's time to call it a night, huh? Actually, it's morning. And we're no closer than when we started. We'll find something. I don't know. You know, this thing with Landis has been going on for so long, I can't believe no one's tried this already. And-and what if we do find some sort of loophole? I mean, how do we know Landis won't wanna, you know, come along with it? John. Yeah, I'm beginning to think we're gonna need a real Christmas miracle to keep him out of jail. John, did you see this? What? "Central Valley Drug Mart vs. Springfield County". They had a platform on their roof with some sort of big promotional display, including a tree. Lemme see. The county asked them to take it down, said it represented a hazard. Right and-- But the judge ruled they could keep it up as long as the tree-- Wasn't attached to the roof. Show me this tree. ♪ Hey! Hey, what do you think you're doing? Who are you? I'm Mr. Landis' attorney. Who authorized you to take down that tree? Well, the county says that if he doesn't follow the law and take it down, we can do it for him. I'm the Deputy County Prosecutor, and this case is still being heard in court. Hmm. Looks like we settled it for you. Excuse me. Oh, and Counselor? Umm, If you could remind your client that he may still be looking at some jail time. What do you want to do? We've come this far, we can't give up now. Come on, let's go. They already pulled the tree down? Yes, sir. Hmm. Well, I don't like it, but strictly speaking, I suppose they were within the law. Well, what about the court ruling on Central Valley Drugs? Would it hold up in court? Does it apply? Well, I think you found your loophole. But it's a moot point, the tree's no longer an issue. It is if we put it back up. Wait, what? The court ruling clearly stipulates that as long as the tree isn't attached. Hold on, Sarah. Now look, you did what I asked. You both worked together. You found a solution. You made sure that Mr. Landis is never gonna spend another Christmas in jail. You should be proud of that. You made a difference and justice has been served. Now look. Tonight is Christmas Eve. It's a time to be with the people you care about. Alright? And that's what I want you to do. Both of you. With all due respect, your Honour, I don't think we've made any difference at all. I'm sorry? This isn't about the law or about serving justice. This is about Mr. Landis. He's still all alone in that big old house. He doesn't have anyone to spend Christmas with. The only thing he wanted, the only thing that means anything to him, they took down. It doesn't matter anymore why he wants that tree on his roof. What that matters is that, that is his Christmas wish. And I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure that wish comes true. Do you know how much work it will take to get that tree back up there to code? But there's still time. If I had a little help. John, is the Prosecutor's office ready to go along with this? Absolutely. Alright. Well, you're gonna need a building permit. Marcie, would you get me the county permits office on the phone? Oh yeah, tell them we have a Christmas tree to put up. Way up.

Danny, these are friends of mine. Good friends. Very good friends. Hi Danny, it's been a long time. You always wanted to know why I put that tree up there every Christmas? This is the reason, right here. I was just a little boy when my mother took me away. I remember, it was Christmas Eve. I've made my decision, it's over. No, it's already done, we're leaving. She said we were never coming back here. But just before we left, my Dad, he pulled me aside and he told me-- Look for the Christmas tree. No matter what, no matter how long it took, if I ever wanted to find him-- Always look for the tree. On the rooftop. On the rooftop. So that tree really was a beacon. To show your son the way home. It was my only hope. When my Mom got married again, she changed my name too. So I knew there wasn't much chance you'd find me. These last few years I've been in the army. But I got leave this Christmas. And as soon as I got back, I started looking. And I found you. I finally found you. Welcome home, son. God bless you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
