Holy shit, girl, those are triple locked away in Fort Knox. How the hell did you get ...Magic. Ate half an apple at lunch, which I know is more than 20 calories. But these are literally going to save my ass. And what the stopping me from reporting you to the Robot King? Uh, because I would not hesitate to report you to the Robot King about your little indiscretions in the back store with that muy caliente jail bait. Mm! Mmm. If Robot King catched you, know that I have no part in this. Small price to pay for an awesome ass. Come on, we're going to be late. Okay, everybody, Harold Landsgrove is almost here, and let's not forget why we are here, which to unveil the new CCC collection. So I want you to give him a warm CCC welcome. Be to be. Be to be. Be to be. You are an integral Adam in the CCC galaxy. You Soldier and in its army of success. Be to be. Be to be. WTF? Aunt Flow's come to visit. A week early, that bitch. Plug it up, girl. Plug it up. Craig to Jemma. - Jemma to Craig. - Are you wearing what I think you're wearing? Jemma, where the... where are you going? Unless you want me to bleed all over the floor, I've got to go plug my hole right now. Is that okay? I register your feminine issues, and I respect them. Just make sure you're back on the floor in time for Harold's presentation. All hands on deck, okay? What's that? I can't hear you. Yeah, there's static on the line. I'm losing you, Craig. Jemma! Jemma, I'm pretty sure I made myself clear that no one is to have eyes on those jeans until tomorrow morning. You would get us all in a lot of trouble here. Jemma? Hello, my CCC family! How are y'all doing tonight? Be to be. - Be to be. - To be. Belong. Belong! Believe. Believe! Be love. Be love. Become! Become! All right, you guys!

So excitingly amazing. Mm, exciting. Peyton Jules coming here is the most important PR move anyone could ever orchestrate. Super Shapers release rests stress completely on her. But the store's going to be in lock down all night. She's going to get in how exactly? Doors will open for five minutes to let her in, five minutes to let her out, and she'll have an hour - to do her fashion haul. - An hour. Live? Of course. This is a total lockdown. It'll be online as of 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. So you better get your cherubs moving. Okay! Okay, everyone. Back to work, guys. Thanks. All right. Landmark speech, Mr. Landsgrove. Land mark speech. I want you to know I will do whatever it takes to make sure things go as scheduled. Whatever it takes. Of course you are. Have you made a decision about that regional manager position? Not yet. But tomorrow's Monday Madness performance will be a major deciding factor, Chris. A major deciding factor. Um, it's Craig. Oh. Please, call me Harold. Right. Harold. I won't let you down, sir. Harold, you can count on me, sir. I won't let you down. - Lockdown activated. - Won't let you down. Oh, my God, I am totally batty for this batty-utiful top. Oh, my God. How did you get in here, little guy? I'm gonna call him Little P! See you tonight at the CCC. Put them in the back. Is this... Marigold. Over there. Craig to Jemma. Come in, Jemma. Hello. I need five boxes of A25s in the yellow ecosystem. Craig to Hunter. Hunter to Craig. Hunter, what is Jemma's 20? I don't know. I'm not her keeper. Her bee keeper? Be her bee keeper. Find her. I've looked everywhere except for the ladies room. This is seriously going to compromise the rebuild of my ecosystem. You can borrow Jemma to help you finish once you've found her. Fine. Thanks for being such a great team player. Jemma? Jemma, Robot King's got ants in his pants. You know what that means. Craig to Hunter. Craig to Hunter. Any sign of her? Nope. Well, then get back out here stat. We're falling behind.10-4. I love Bollywood music. My favorite song is "Hamara India." What? Uh, I was just saying that I really love "Hamara India." Where you from? Greenville. And do you like Green Day? What's Green Day? It's a band from the 90s? Oh, that's cool. No, I don't. Why? Because it sounds like you're implying that just because my parents are from India, I must automatically like Bollywood music. What? No. No, no, no, no. That's not what I meant. No, I didn't mean that just... Lord, you have eyes on Hunter? She's not in her ecosystem. I sure don't, Craig. How's your ecosystem coming along? We're on schedule. And if I asked you to locate her, that would put you ...I've only got new hires here. If I leave my ecosystem, there's no telling what would happen. Right. Libby, Libby, I have a very important challenge for you. You up for it? - Yes, sir. - Craig. Just Craig. We're all equal here. Sort of like communism. but not really. I have two employees missing. I need them back on the floor A.S.A.P. - Okay. - I need you to locate them. Can you do that for me, Libby? - Yeah. - Yes? I think so, yes. - That's great. - Who are we missing exactly? Jemma and Hunter, my two top girls Jemma and Hunter, right. Start with the bathroom, the break room, anywhere, everywhere. I am tasking you with this, Libby, because I am confident that you can do this for me. Wow. Alrighty then. Okay? - Okay. - Okay, off you go. Yeah. Hello? Those mellow yellow should have been folded 30 minutes ago. Are you the rabbit or the turtle, Camilo? Like the Ninja Turtle? I'd be like... I'd be like Leonardo. Libby! What is it? I found her. Wow, this is horrible. Truly horrible. I knew she was battling serious body issues, but it's just so sad that she couldn't reach out for help. So tragic. So sad. Should we call the police? We can't. We're in lockdown. We have no reception. That means no phones, no Internet, no nothing until the new collection is safely on the shelves. That's the way the CCC's always done it, and we're not deviate at this crucial juncture, right? Right. We have to do something. If we tell anyone else, it could just be panic. Besides, we're on lockdown. There's really nothing we can do until 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. What if there's a killer out there? There's no killer, unless you consider Jemma a killer. Of herself. Are you afraid there's a killer out there? Yeah. Do you like being afraid? No. Do you want everyone else to be afraid, too? That's not really showing team spirit, is it? Right. Libby, I know it's your first day and you're eager to do things by the book, but I don't think you understand the impact this could have. If we don't get that new collection turned around on time, that means Monday Madness is a disaster. And if Monday Madness is a disaster, then the new collection fails, and if the new collection fails, the CCC fails. That's not what you want, is it? You were doing a great job, by the way. You know we had to do that, right? Even if I wanted to, we couldn't even get out to call the police until Peyton Jules and her crew arrived at midnight. I will take care of this first thing in the morning. I promise. Tell you what. You were such a trooper back there that I'm going to waive the first month of your mandatory employee purchase plan. How's that sound? Sounds great. Thank you. We take care of our own here at CCC. Let's go. Are we on target? Craig to Lord. Craig to Lord Lord to Craig. Lord, do you have eyes on Hunter? I sure don't, Craig. Copy that. Okay, ladies, I don't know what you're playing at, but Robot King is going to BLO if he finds out you're playing with the Super Shapers. I'm gonna save your ass this time, but... Craig to Lord, Craig to Lord. What's your 20? Craig to Lord. What's your 20? I'm in the stock room looking for Hunter. Forget about her. I'll take care of that. I need you back on the floor stat. Lord, do you copy?! Just get back to the floor stat. I am two men down, and I can't be three. We are running out of time, and I can't have that. Lord! Lord! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Lord! Lord, what's your 20? I told you get back on the floor. We have a situation here! Lord! Lord! Lord? Lord, what's your 20? Lord? Lord, what's your... 20? No! No, no, no. No. You are the... You're the best goddamn regional manager this place has. It's you. Be to be. Be to be. Oh, my God. It's that guy! It's just a mannequin. Stuffed in a very tiny box. It's a practical joke. People get a little... ...crazy around Monday Madness. Aaah! - You know? - No. No, no. That didn't look like a mannequin. - It's happening again. - Libby, Libby. Don't you trust Harold Landsgrove? Maybe we should... maybe we should call the police when Peyton Jules comes in. You don't... no, no, no, no, no. No, I highly advise against that course of action. You know what, Libby? You're right. We should do something about this. I tell you what, I will call Harold. He will be the one to advise us on the best course of action, okay? Yeah. Yeah? Great. Okay. After you. Fudge. Lockdown deactivated. Oh, my God. I'm so, like, totally excited I could just die. Hi, you guys. Hi. No photos. No photos! Hey, guys, phones down. - Phones down! - Where the fuck were you? Just tidying up. Everything better be ready, or Harold will roast your ass. All set now, Barb. All set. So what's the game plan? I think I start with the floor and take her through the jeans ecosystem. You! I've been tasked with that, Craig. Me, me, me. Got that? Me. Absolutely. Mm. Absolutely. 100%. Loud and clear. So... so glad to have you on board with us, Barb. So glad! Oh, my God. Are those the Super Shapers? Yes, they certainly are. I've been waiting for these for my whole entire life. So have we all. So, Peyton, you're the woman of the hour. What are you thinking? Give us your vision. I love everything but these. These I want. Can we got these for her? Abso-doozely-lutely. Absolutely. What size are you, honey? Zero. Got that? I certainly do. Now, Peyton, if you'll excuse me, I'll have to go get those myself personally. Just get them, okay? He needs to hurry up. We're going live in 10 minutes. It's not my opinion. I explained it before. There are no live feeds during the change over. Your piece will go online at 8:00 a.m. when the doors open. What?! My credibility is at stake here. I have millions waiting for my broadcast. Well, just think about how much they'll be begging for it if they have to wait. It's all about building the anticipation. Are we cool? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How about I get you and your crew some awesome CCC promo gear? It's ultra exclusive. Sounds awesome. Don't move. Jemma! You guys, I am losing my mojo. I can't really lose my mojo. So let's just shoot this thing, okay? Ready? Oh, hey, guys! Welcome to the CCC's brand-spankin-new collection reveal.

Come in! Shruti, what's your 20? Craig? Yes. I'm at the back door. You? My office. What? What is it? Spit it out. I don't know. Are you afraid there's a killer out there? I will do whatever it takes to make sure things go as scheduled. Whatever it takes. His office has the only door that locks. So unless you have a better idea, that's where we're going. Craig, let us in! Us? Who? Shruti and ...bby! Come on, hurry! Hurry! Let us in! Libby! There you are. I was wondering ...What happened? - What is that thing? - What thing? That thing that killed everyone in the store. I don't know what that was, nothing. Mass hallucination. Mass hallucination? Bullshit. Uh, Libby, please, please don't touch that. There. There's someone out there. We have to go check it out. I'm not going anywhere. That thing is still out there. We have to make sure everyone's okay. Well, you go out there, and you're dead. Hang on. You were out there. And you're not dead. Look. There. You're singing "Hamara India", right? Okay, so I like to listen to Bollywood music once in a while. Is that a crime? Give me your phone, Shruti. Your phone. There. Hello there. That... that's a bindi. It can hear me. I can understand. You don't actually think you can communicate with that thing. Okay. So we know two things... it loves Bollywood music, and it has a bindi on its forehead. You speak Indian, right? There are over like 130 different languages in India. Okay, well, you speak one of them. Yeah, Hindi, and a little bit of Urdu. Let's get what it wants. What? It obviously wants something. Maybe if we give it what it wants, it'll stop. Wait, where'd it go? It... it's Hindi. Keerat. Keerat? What's Keerat? It's a girl's name. "Me." Who's Keerat? How should I know? Look up your employee records. Employees... We don't have employees. Over there, it's just lines and lines and lines and lines of subcontractors. We don't actually know who... who works for us. Well... then, how can you know if you're employing fair trade workers and that they aren't working in sweatshops and that the cotton they're using is organic? We don't! Okay? Jesus! That's just a line. When are you gonna figure that out? No, no, no, no, no. No, no. W-what we can do and what we do know is we can trace everything back about those chains. We know exactly which genetically modified seed - they're grown from. - GMOs? You're using GMOs? How do you think they can make a pair of jeans for five dollars and sell them for 150? Keerat. "Picked cotton." "Dead." How old were you when you died, Keerat? It's not called child labor for nothing, right? Hold on now. The SCC has strict ethical standards... You just said you can't trace back who works for you! You guys were supposed to be the good guys. I came here to do good. And get half-price clothes. We have to help her. "Justice." "Justice for Keerat." Keerat, if we tell the world your story, will you stop killing? No, stop! What did you do?! You idiot! I had her. And you just made her mad again. Oh, I'm so sorry. Did I not get the memo, or are we talking about a pair of killer pants here?! You knew what was out there, and you didn't do anything about it! You knew? If you hadn't hidden that girl's death and if you'd let me call the police, then they'd all still be alive! That is some God danged insubordination right there. I'm gonna have to sanction you, young lady. Sanction me all you want. I quit. Yeah? - Well, you're fired. - Enough! How many more pairs of those jeans are there? 175. What? What? What? What? What if more of them are alive? Shit. Oh, God. It's coming for us. We have to make sure. Come on. What the fuck, Craig?! Let us out. So, I've been thinking. I'm going to need you to hand over that camera. Can't have that story floating out there. I'm sure you understand. No way. You and your bunch of CCC hypocrites are going down. Why, Shruti, I didn't know you cared about anything. This must be a first for you. How does that feel? You will do anything to make it right. Soon that door is going to burst. It's you or the camera. Your choice. This is what you want? Come and get it. Just give me the camera, and we can all go home like none of this ever happened. I'll even give you a raise. Come on, Shruti. This isn't you. Why the sudden change of heart? Craig to Shruti. Craig to Shruti. Come in, Shruti. Come in, Shruti. Okay, Craig. You win. There you go. Fuck! Give it now! The card. I know you have it. No. No, no! You're not gonna ruin it for those pants, ruin everything I have ever worked for. It's clothes. It's just clothes. It's not just clothes. See, see, see. In an ecosystem of life. Keerat! Justice! Keerat? Please... don't. These people haven't done anything to you. This is right, Keerat. This isn't justice. Lockdown deactivated. No, don't! Don't! No! Welcome to the CCC family. We're all equal here, sort of like capitalism. Capitalism. Hi, you guys. Welcome back. And now we're all ready for yoga season! Mm! Mm! Mm! Mm! Mm! Hello? Hello? Hunter? It's been way more than five minutes.
