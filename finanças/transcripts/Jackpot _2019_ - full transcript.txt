Coming, dear 'Whether I milk my cows or not you are here at the crack of dawn!' 'Bunny rabbit' Uncle, will you give me a bunny? You look like a bunny yourself 'No, I can't give' Get lost then! I used a new vessel just for you Hold it tight so it doesn't spill Look over there! The bunny has fallen into the pit 'Aiyaiyo! It has become a habit for him' I lied to you Just like that Get lost, madcap jenny! 'I milked only 1300 milliliter It has flowed all the way here' 'Doesn't make sense at all' 'Milk is flowing nonstop!!' 'This bowl is generating milk of its own accord continuously' 'Let me check this cauldron' 'If the bowl is held upside down the magic doesn't work' 'Now it works, huh?' 'Few Years Later' 'How has the milkman hit the jackpot all of a sudden?' Are you sure no one is in there? I know, because the owner has gone to the next village to preside over a function There's just 1 brass vessel If he has this under lock and key it may be a brass coated gold bowl Let us take it Just in case 'Who is that?' - Thief! - Nab him 'Catch hold of him' 'Thief...thief!'

Shift it to a corner No, the seer told me to keep it in the center, right under the fan 'A seer told you?' Yes, in 3 days, 100 rupee notes will blossom for sure, he assured me How can this happen? I told you not to conceive in August Did you trust my superstition? Am I solely responsible?! 'Hey!

'Daddy, mummy' My father's shirt His shirt will fit me right Beggar of the 1st order! His shirts are all old He has made me ridicule even my own father! How will I step out with this ugly face? Maybe all this is a dream? 'Let me see if I get my old face when I wake up!' Here - He said he was going to Bangalore - Door is open He forgot to lock the house Your son is so irresponsible [loud snore] Who is he, dear? Who is this sprawled in our hall- - Thief! - Let me check Is this an exhibition? - Call the police - Go That's the creature we told you about Look how he's sleeping, sir 'Hey! Get up' - Tired after stealing, huh? - Good morning, sir Appa...amma! Look at my plight I am your son Ragul Hey! Who is he? - Why are you asking me? - Is he your son? Why have you raised him like this? You named him just 5 letters and fed him 5 gallons of milk? Does he resemble either of us? Who are you? How do you know my son's name? I am your son, ma Arrest him, sir, he has helped himself to my shirt 'Wonder what else is missing!' Appa, amma, listen to me I swear I'm your son, Ragul I derided a soothsayer, that too mildly He cast a spell on me You look like a soothsayer yourself How can you call your own son that? You look like their uncle How can he be your father?

Sentinel in Andamans? Before you ask me, look at yourself in the mirror I've seen my face day in and day out - Please listen to me, sir - Why should I? I know of thieves who will beg to be released You call them 'amma, appa' instead Is this a new trend? Take off that mask This isn't a mask, sir A wretched soothsayer changed my face - Why that strange look? - Did you look like hero Ajith earlier? Carbon copy, sir Spinning a ghost story to us, huh? 1st you stop spinning your wheels 'Looks like a higher official's car' 'Here she comes!' Park the bike somewhere inside Wow! Police bike, dismantle all the parts immediately Make it fast - What do you think? - Super! What is this? My heart Take it You and your silly heart! 'That's all' Ready, boys 'My loving gift to Masha' 'Aiyo baldie!' Stop! How is it? What does he lack in life? His voice gives me strife! Hit you, quail head! Listening to our threats today Somasundaram should flee from this state That's impossible, bro Why jinx my wish even before it gets fulfilled 3 is not our lucky # Only 5 is lucky Nothing will work out if 3 of us travel with an aim Even to the moon only 3 astronauts went 3 in Tamil is 'moonu' So # fits well Did they bring back gold? All they brought was sand Bro, look a girl wants a lift 'We got the magic number 5' Let's give the girl a lift, bro How will that be 5? We can find a 5th passenger, bro Is this a share auto to pick up passengers on the way? Okay, fine Stop the car 'Vanakkam', sir We'll get down at the plains Can you give us a lift? How many are 'we'? Me and my guru Babjima - Babji? - Yes, sir Minister Sambasivam waiting to see us secretly Why is he waiting for you? To ask Babjima if he will get the chief minister's posting I can myself tell him he won't get that post - Why do you bother? - How can you say this? If he can't even arrange a car for you what will he achieve as CM? He asked us to take a bus without anyone's knowledge But we had a minor problem in the bus and the conductor asked us to get down 'We've been waiting for long and no sight of any vehicle' 'Please help us, sir' Okay, get in Call your 'Bhajji' - Seeress - Babjima 'They offered us a lift just as you prophesied' Come on 'Get in' Come, Babjima Hurry up, slow coach! 'Look at the jug she's holding and the golden halo' Welcome, seeress 'Vanakkam', Babjima Open the door for her She's sanctifying our car This 'Bhajji'ma must be very orthodox Please get in Drive on Why is she sleeping from when she got in? She's meditating ' - Meditation? - Tumbler, shut up' Why did the bus driver ask you to get down? Babjima in her enlightened state shared a hidden truth And what truth was that? She told the conductor 'You've married the driver's sister' 'Then why are you drooling behind Girija?' she asked The driver heard that and fought with the conductor And forced to get down in the middle of nowhere She thinks so deeply, huh? Looks like she'll dig out a big pile of truth We can ask Babjima if our threats on Somasundaram will work out in our favor Before you threaten him he'll close your chapter Bhajji-ma, you gave me a heart attack! Halt near the forest We'll get down here She just said something important Hey! Can't you wait? He'll be so alert when least required! 'Bhajji'ma, you made my heart almost stop Somasundaram tortured me too much Tell me a way to teach him a lesson I must make him stand 'new' sometime in his life New? As in first time? With no clothes on him - Oh! Nude, you mean? - Yes, that's right 'This child wishes it What shall we do?' Tumbler, she has started her mantra - For you - Thank you Will this neem be enough to teach Somu a lesson? Smell this and inhale Look up at the sky Spit it out with your head held high How is that possible? - Look up and spit - Just obey her command - Very good - Your problems will be solved Thank you very much, 'Bhajji'ma Somu, I'll get you I'll reduce you to this root Spit, doesn't matter if your face gets covered with saliva But obey 'Bhajji'ma's words Why do I feel so cold all of a sudden? Why are you sitting like this? 'Bro, didn't you look at yourself?' 'Where is your gold chain?' 'Watch and ring also missing' Babjima must have chanted the wrong mantra Shut up! Let's get into the car - Where's my car? - Aiyo! Car is missing 'They have duped us' 'They ditched us in this forest and whizzed away in my car' We can't even hitch hike Let's call and tell your sister, bro That's right, bro They stripped only our dress My sister will skin us alive What do we do now? 'Auto driver, collect your fare later' What is this disguise? Why are you dressed like this? Bro met a seer to ensure you give birth to a baby boy He gave this herbal dress and asked us to hang it like a festoon - Which seer does he mean? - Never heard of a herbal dress 5 is your lucky # You could've taken 2 more people I would've tied festoons in all 5 doorways 'As if he listens!' - She'll hang me with her blind faith - Where are you off to? 'You must 1st go to our prayer room' Why are you going to the bathroom? You ladies cry in the bedroom when you have a problem 'We men go into the loo to cry if we have a problem' Why are you covered even more? I usually wear full sleeve shirts, right? If he wears a herbal dress will I get a baby boy? 'Yes, organic dress' - You bloody female - 'Did you call me?' She heard me, huh? I can't even cry in peace 'I'll get even with you wherever you are' [scene from 'Petta'] If you stand and create such a ruckus how can we watch the film? You expect me to sit and watch my hero's opening scene? 'What audacity!' I didn't ask No...no - How dare you! - Don't hit me Trying to undermine me? Who told you to ask? Will you ask? I won't ask hereafter Get up 'I know what to do with you' Just go die Hey! Who asked you to come here? Why are you glaring at me? Who told you to come here? Why aren't you in uniform? Go and wear your uniform 'This isn't a theater Get into your uniform' Go inside Come in Hey! Why are you crowding here? Clear out What happened? I slipped and fell 'Please knuckle crackle for me' Isn't this also a new experience? Being free birds we should visit many new places This is the only place we never visited Advocate, where the hell are you? Come here Make it fast Ouch! When everyone kept quiet and just watched you saved me from that she-devil You have a heart of gold You come across as a good girl How did you land up here? 'Don't ask me to share my sob story' Sunderapandi is an inspector in my hometown He's a real bad cop who will threaten everyone and grab their money He will threaten even innocent children 'You go to school, right? Pay my usual 'bata' then' 'He was torturing everyone' I saw him harassing a pregnant flower girl That's why I hit him And landed here How dare you hit me, inspector Sunderapandi? Forget that What crime did you commit? I had an 'idli' shop of my own Did they put you behind bars for owning an 'idli' shop? Not that, dear Daily I used to clean the dishes in the river nearby 'On one such occasion I found a vessel' I stored my 'idlis' in it and sold them The 'idlis' didn't decrease at all Don't you know to make good 'idlis'? The workers in the rice mill next door frequented only my shop 'I kept serving them 'idlis' from the vessel I found in the river' It kept increasing Didn't lessen at all 'I was thoroughly baffled' 'If I turn the vessel upside down it won't multiply' Then what happened? 'I dropped a hundred rupee note inside' 'The notes started multiplying continuously' 'I was so stunned, dear' Oh my God! Where is that vessel now? I was scared someone might beat me up and grab that magic vessel from me 'I dug a hole 3' deep and buried it in the cattleshed of Mr Rayappan's rice mill' 'I took the money I got from the vessel' And went to deposit it in the bank like I usually do The manager wanted to meet me I went into his cabin and I am in here now Why? He said the serial numbers are identical on the notes and put me behind bars A calf is tied in that shed Near that post to our right 'I have buried it 3' deep over there' I have only few more years to live You are good hearted social workers This vessel should reach good hands like yours Go and take that magic vessel 'Use it for your social service' All that's fine Why did that warden beat you mercilessly? Simple request, dear All I asked her was if she will iron my sari? Is that wrong? She beat me up so ruthlessly for that simple request of mine, dear I don't blame her for losing her temper 'She could have struck a few more blows' 'We beat up that poor soul not knowing the facts of the case' [sobbing loudly] "Life is a disguise without question Where is true affection?" Sathish...? 'Who is that bear-head?' He has gone out of town He'll be back after 10 days Why haven't you gone out of town too, honey? This broom will speak Get lost, scumbag Mad female! Sweeping in the middle of the night 'Who are you?' We are veterinary doctors We are here to check if your cattle is disease free Animal doctor, huh? Our bull is fine, you can leave A new disease called 'Gupsa' is spreading now We are here to vaccinate your bull Will you take us to your cattle shed? Don't bother me, madam Let that damn bull die for all I care I swear, such a pest! Yov! How dare you say this? I'll report you to Blue Cross Come in then I'll call the ambulance You don't know about our Pinky Pinky, huh? Pinky is our bull That is Pinky over there Akshu It looks like a holy terror 'It is a wild beast' 'It has gored the intestines of 75 people so far' We won't even go near it to fill its water trough We don't know how it is still alive Hey! All of you go and hide You can witness an event These 2 doctors want to meet Pinky Why is he giving us the jitters? Let's retrace our steps I'm really terrified We can't achieve anything if we get scared easily Our future lies under Pinky's hoof! Do you have a shovel and crowbar? Why do you want a shovel and crowbar when you are here to inject our bull? We need to do an urine test on Pinky by shovelling the mud she has peed on Only then we can check A+, B+, cow boy + jersey milk = A1 B1 milk Enough of your gibberish You want a shovel and spade? Over there Help yourself Do you want anything as your 'Last supper'? 'Last supper', huh? - What will take time to prepare? - Tea Okay, bring that But take your time 'Wonder what will happen!' Will we land up in jail like that lady who dropped notes into that magic vessel? Only if we drop currency we will get the same serial # If we store gold and diamond we won't have any problem, Masha If a drunkard gets hold of this vessel ...he need not haunt a wine shop for his spirits! Bad timing for your poor jokes, Masha - This chap? - He owns this place? Hey! Who is this? What are you doing here? They want to ensure our Pinky doesn't have Gupsa, some new disease They are naming diseases very creatively after this Dengue epidemic Their height and weight look vaguely familiar Let me see your faces We are here to inject your bull This bull shows scant respect even to good lookers Imagine the reaction to your screwed up faces As if he is Prince Charming! Give me a prescription I can do the needful If he recognizes us he will close our chapter! Looks like a complicated medicine Why have you written 'Amithabh Bachan'? That isn't Amithabh Bachan Amrutanjan Cold relief balm How can Pinky be calmed with a balm? How are you, Babjima? I am doing good Are you fine? Masha, will you zip your damn lips? Bro, do you know who that lady is? Babjima who grabbed our cars and stripped us to our birthday suit Run, Masha! Close the gate Grab them! Shut the gate Why are they posing like models? Can't we get her if she hides in the car? Save my car, I say Hurry up Get the car...run Bro, where are the doctors? They left without drinking tea Aiyo! I'm going in search of them Pour it in a flask and bring it - Right away, bro - Son of a bloody buffalo! 'Wow! Masha is here' Masha, my precious angel Didn't Masha come with you? Why are you bothered? Pay me for the car Dhilip, get me a glass of tea This deal is not for money I agreed only for Masha Sit down Masha is upset Whaaat? My darling moppet is upset? You sure have a silver tongue But what is the use? Tell me what I should do I'll bend backwards for my Masha Pinky that Masha's father reared is the apple of her eye Afflicted by poverty her father sold Pinky Masha saw Pinky in Manasthan's house Pinky shed a stream of tears looking at Masha it seems That's why Masha is thoroughly upset Tell me where Pinky is I will lift it with my left hand and give it to Masha in my right You'll lift Pinky with your left hand? Tar tin head! Do you know who is Pinky? Her pet doggy, right? - No - Meow! Pet cat, right? That's even more easy Pinky isn't even a pet! - Then? - Bull from Kangeyam Did I hear you right? Masha is mine only if I tame that bull, huh? If you want to impress Masha tomorrow is Masha's birthday Somehow make sure you give her Pinky as gift Where will I get such a big box to gift wrap that Pinky? I don't know if you will stick it inside a box or tie it altogether? But if you bring Pinky to her Masha's feelings for you Masha's feelings for me- Get her Pinky and I will complete the sentence tomorrow Oh my dear Maaaashaaa!

Please...happy birthday Did you bring my Pinky? I've brought a special gift along with Pinky just for you Come on Wait...wait Pinky will cry as soon as he sees me I can't bear to see him so upset Most probably he will be sedated He won't be able to see you - Have you tied him up? - Yes Okay, then open the door My special gift for you You need someone to clean Pinky's dung That's why I brought a servant boy along! Aiyo! Baldie This isn't my Pinky, baldie Oh my goodness!

Did you strip not to get your clothes dirty? Don't take a dig at me unaware of what happened That girl dived like a fish without holding a rope! Caring two hoots she tanned our hides Aren't you ashamed to praise them sitting here without a stitch on you? Instead of sitting here shamelessly we would've hung ourselves to death Already we have experience- Tumbler, zip your lips I warned you to be alert around them 'They won't stop with this' They will blackmail you Your dignity will go for a toss Doesn't matter if I lose my dignity, Manastha They took away my mosquito repellent Coil + stand! Aiyo! Specimens like you should be strang- Dai! Go and look for them Strip these knots out of my hands They already stripped you! 'How can you befriend such a specimen?' Even if I prayed wrong Allah has saved us That baldie tattletale let us down badly We can't retrieve that now, Akshu We need 1 more hand Machan! I was looking for you My dear friend! Beggars earlier pleaded 'Ammaaa' Now you're bonding as my friend? Looks like you'll ask for a bride next I'll punch your mouth - I'm your Ragul - Which Ragul? Don't you recognize me, your Ragul? If you're Ragul I'm Google! Go and search over there I'll jog your memory with an incident, will you listen? We claimed money can grow on a plant and tricked my father to eat 'biriyani' Do you remember that? You had this same crook of an expression 'My idea of money on a plant worked out, eh?' Now do you remember? Hundred rupee note blossom- - Darling! - Good lord...ghost! Nicey, you had a decent face Now it looks like a worn out handbag! 'Whaaat? Who is he?' Sir, wait in Kabir Bhai's shop We'll discuss our constituency- I'm starving Get me some food Sir, what do you want to ord- Who let you in here? Door was open I walked in Hey! Drive this tramp away Clay stove nose fellow! I contributed to this hotel's growth Bhai, I'm your Ragul Don't you feel ashamed to say you're Ragul, with this ugly face? - Listen to me - Get up Are you Arvind Swami or what? He's my friend, go Sathish, instead of a millionaire how can you befriend a beggar? 1st I should cut my friendship with you, get us 2 cups of tea Go, dirty dish face! Bhai can't recognize me - Even I can't recognize you - What? Only Ragul and I know about that money plant - How do you know? - You still don't believe me? Nothing is believable if I look at you Once when I maligned your girlfriend you quoted this saying 'A crow thinks its chick is a swan' - Stop it - How yuck it sounds! - The chick story - Rack your brains If you're really Ragul what happened? You are the main culprit You smeared cake on my face last week My trouble started then What are you saying? You went home that night A soothsayer came to my doorstep late at night Aiyo! Unbearable!! Disgusting! I can't bear to see my own face Looks like you're fibbing after watching Harry Potter in Tamil I am speechless When we were taking a short film, we came across a soothsayer ...in the cemetery in Sendhil Nagar performing some ritualistic prayer Take offerings to God and meet him - Okay? - I'll go tonight Careful, don't disturb the ghosts resting there Order 'biriyani' 'Babyma, I'm on the way for you' 'Lamb trotters stew, liver, pan roasted mutton fry' 'Biriyani', chicken lollipop Order these for me Hey glutton! Lazy lout Did you fib to get this feast? Ragul's idea, huh? If I bash you up his face will become like yours True that! Don't try to fool me! Shouldn't a man feel hungry if his face changes? I can't even get 1 square meal No wonder 'Gaja' cyclone strikes! We got the whale we wanted! Hey! Even if the world keeps saying 'you are dead' If this town screams out loud 'you have been burnt to ashes' ...until I tell you never ever give up! - Give up - 'Hey ultimate!' Aiyo! Who are you? You look like a half baked wild boar Can we brag about our own self?! Why are you telling a corpse Ultimate star Ajith's dialogs? I used to mimic celebrities when I was jobless and bored Now as an undertaker I'm cremating corpses Sir, when is the soothsayer expected? Yov! Is today some special function? He seems to be in high demand Already there is a duo waiting for him Where? Who are they? College students, huh? Hello, excuse me Hello, students Masha, some creature is attacking us Stay right there 'Don't pick that stone' If you come closer I'll stone you Listen, I'm as human as both of you Listen to my history first What is this bad habit? Madam, do you know how handsome I was? I argued a bit with a soothsayer He made this beautiful swan an ugly duckling - Even you? - What do you mean, 'even you'? Even we were transformed like this by a soothsayer Is it so, madam? If you are so beautiful even after the transformation ...imagine what a stunner you must have been earlier But you look familiar to me I've seem you somewhere 'Where have I seen you?' It's a legal offense to travel without ticket Hey! Weren't you the one who tricked me at the railway station 2 months ago? - Am I not right? - She got changed only 2 days ago Really? - This is confusing - I'll show you how I was - No need - Take a look - What is this? - I looked like Revathi in 'Manvaasanai' What? Checked for the fresh earth smell as the title claims! But I still feel I saw you in the railway station Don't keep harping on that Only day before yesterday, the soothsayer came to my house asking for some food I went in to get food for him My dog Akshya went to bite him The soothsayer transformed my pet doggy like this Aiyaiyo! Very true I was so shocked and I slapped him He shoved his little drum under my nose And changed me from a teenager to this 'me' A prospective groom is visiting me next week 'How sad Is that so?' Couldn't you concoct any other story? Is the groom Prabhu of 'Chinna Thambi' fame? Madam! Maybe that thief of a girl would have provoked the soothsayer Irritated he would have transformed your doggy into that girl, am I right? You mean that wretched fellow gave me a criminal's face? I don't like this human form one bit I wish to be only a pup We are souls to be pitied I am the most pathetic soul Instead of feeling happy you are such a beauty rather than a doggy ...you seem to be lamenting with us 'Look at her pranks' But you know how handsome I was? Now look at me My hair is like a heap of hay! My ears resemble terracotta lamps! My nose is just like a punctured foot ball But your eyes are like that of a puppy Aiyo! I'm pouring out my woes and she is correcting my vision 'I'm unable to go anywhere during the day with this face, I step out only at night' - Wretched fellow! - Soothsayer is here Come along 'Bro, pick up our item' We want to meet the soothsayer Not the tea shop owner Hey coir head! This is the soothsayer - Is he? - Telling you it's me I sell tea till 12 midnight Then I wander around shouting aloud my oracle! - He'll go on his oracle rounds - No...no You didn't change my face 'How can I change your face?' Thank God, he is not the one Sir, a jinx mouthed soothsayer changed all our faces and forms He made them beautiful but made me look like a folklore spirit Can you use your magic and restore our forms? Aiyaiyo! From what you say ...you've got into the bad books of a genuine soothsayer Their curses cannot be retracted Not possible to rewrite your fate No point in living in this world with this beastly face I'll hang myself to death in that house - No one should stop me - Don't run, stop - Is there a rope? - Rope is inside - Stop - Listen He changed us too Are we committing suicide? No one will be scared seeing you One look at me, thinking I'm a ghost they run for their lives If he can change a dog into a beauty I would've been happy with half those looks I don't like my face now Isn't beauty skin deep? Even if he's dark, Rajinikanth is the one and only super star Though they may look different, so many have been successful in films you know? 'Vadakkupatti Ramasamy'!! Look at my fate A pup is advising me! This is reason enough to hang myself - I hate you - Listen to me I don't like people who run I'll bite you Nobody should stop me Hey! Open the door Drum is here 'Where is the damn rope?' Let me listen to a nice song while dying 'Nice song being played' Switch off that song What are you doing? There must be some way out - Don't lose hope - No, my dear I can't think of any other option I was very handsome as a kid My mother used to ridicule others bragging about me If my mother sees my face now, she will surely die My last wish, my mother should hate me Close the window and leave Masha, run 'Wretched fellows!' My house that even Gaja cyclone couldn't touch ...that wild bison has destroyed by trying to hang himself Shame on you! You can't even hang properly Is it a regular habit of mine? Even Lord of Death, Yama has rejected you Madam, feed her in that corner She isn't letting me eat in peace Staring daggers at me My poor Akshu darling Madam, isn't it a waste to live in this world with such a face? After eating all this I'll hang myself happily I'll tie you with iron chains Do you know how degrading I feel about myself? Yesterday a small boy fell off his bike breaking the eggs and started crying Passers-by gave him money I couldn't even give him 10 rupees and help him Why do I need this face? Our kiddo seems to have branched out on his own! Why do you keep saying you want to die? That's all If your face is your only problem you can change it with plastic surgery If you consult a Siddha doctor in USA ...he will operate on you and make you Prince Charming What are you saying? Even Michael Jackson transformed himself like that Bloody thief! If that's true let's go Hey! Is it Ambattur? America You'll need lakhs to go to America So much, huh? Then won't I get Michael Jackson's face? You have to spend 50 million to get Michael Jackson's face 50 million? I don't even know what a dog knows! Knowledgeable dog- Let's rob somewhere and then go to USA Whaaaat? Robbery, huh? 'How can you suggest that?' - God help us! - What? How can you get that idea sitting in this house? - Slip of the tongue - 1st gargle your mouth Okay, I will right away Finally we have roped him in Cleansed! He may become curious if we mumble now Come straight to the point What is your dog saying? Actually in the house belonging to Manasthan ...endorsing the principles of 'Vastu' a vessel has been buried in its cattle shed - Okay - If we dig it out and sell ...all our problems will be solved Madam, advising me against stealing you are nurturing a thieving dog! 1st you gargle your mouth and get cleansed Hold it I'm not planning this for my sake It is only for both your faces As if we have a face to be proud of? The damage has been done Next week a prospective groom is coming to meet me Aiyo! Before that let us dig out that vessel and bathe, all our sins will be washed Are we going for Manasthan's funeral? Our mission is to steal You're blabbering about sins! You are letting your tongue run Eaten enough Go to Manasthan's house Can I eat the last course of 'rasam' and rice? If you touch 'rasam' I'll kill you and pour curd Usually milk is poured in a funeral Is curd the new fermented milk? Bro, look here Somasundaram is standing All he can do is stand I'm sitting in style Aiyo! I meant the election Can every contestant win? I'm wondering when and how to tackle that deadly duo 'Clear out now...go' 'Who are you?' Get out Out, I say 'Clear out' - Sir, do you own this place? - No - Then bloody well shut up! - Hey...hey - He was rude to me - 'Vanakkam', sir Wait, who are you? Sir, I've come looking for a job - Keep looking - I'm not in a position to laugh I've come seeking a job, sir My workers are jobless as it is What job will I give you? Go away Madam, that buffoon nose is shooing me away Shall I just leave? Will you continue with your bloated face?
