Emmie, Anton's right, don't you see His practice is losing money. Here are the figures. A country doctor never makes money. That's why I want to sell this place and move to town. I could even get an appointment to a hospital. No! - Be reasonable, Emmie. I won't sell my share. Papa left it to us. When Salem was taken away you took his share. But I won't sign and I won't sell! I don't want to say any more about it. I won't sign it. When it was Ester and Salem and me, we each had our equal say. You, have your say. That's why we want you to agree, and sign. When Salem was here... - Salem, come to supper! Salem! Salem. Salem, come to supper! Yes, Emmie... when Salem was here? Well at least he was a man. He may have gotten drunk, but he ran this farm. He worked out there. Didn't just sit around in his study reading medical pamphlets, waiting for the phone to ring! This is none of your business, Emmie. Anton is a doctor, not a farmer. And so now I'm the maid. - Be reasonable, Emmie. Change the sheets Do the laundry Scrub the floors It's no use. Emmie will never agree to sell the farm. If I could have gotten the cash two years ago we would be in the city now. I'm a good doctor. I was before I came out here. What you mean is, before you married me. That's not it. Oh! Salem! But, how did you... you in... I thought... I've been thinking about you, Britt. I've been thinking about you for a long time. Dr. Jenks. Britt? She's what? Oh no, Mr. Torens, come on, come on. Well, I'll be right over. This way. The back bedroom. Alright. Mrs. Torens? Do you mind stepping out while I examine her? Well... what was it? She was strangled. Strangled?... But why? Why would anyone want to kill our Britt? Can't have been dead very long. Well, we'd better take care of your wife. And then let the police know. What are all those ties for? I don't know. I just don't know. Somebody been fooling with your bag? Emmie's been telling me to get my ties cleaned, and... damned if I don't keep forgetting! That woman! She always has to have her way, ha. Ah, Inspector. Found anything? Strangulation. Manual? - No. These regular contusions rule out bare hands. A stocking, soft cord, or something like that, I'd say. Was she assaulted? - No. Did she put up a fight? Hard to say. She was a strong girl. What's the smell? It's this chest rub she's been using. One of the popular brands. Oil of peppermint. Ah... Menthol in fact. - That's it. Very funny! Very funny trick! What are you talking about? - These! Why put them in my bag? I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe Emmie does. Emmie! Emmie, dear! So you don't know anything about my instruments? You didn't take them out of my bag and stick these in their place? I did not! Are you insane? No. But I'm sure that someone in this house is trying to make it look that way! Emmie! Em...! - SHHHH! So it's Emmie. It's Emmie, isn't it? She's found out. How could she? She's acted strangely for a long time. She watching. Everything! Every move! She keeps bringing up Salem. Salem this! Salem that! Salem! Salem! Salem! Anton,... you're upset. Calm down. Emmie couldn't know and even if she did she couldn't do anything about it. Oh, she could. Anton, a drunken farmhand was found killed in the yard! Salem was found guilty. The police were satisfied then and no story of Emmie's is going to change that. The parrot could change that. Parrot? The parrot saw it all and he heard you. What if he said, "Hit him, Anton! Hit him, Anton!" No one pays attention to what a parrot says. Emmie would pay good attention to that and make sure that the police did, too! No. Emmie can't hurt us now. Oh yes, she could and she will try. Why take my instruments? What use has she for the morphine? Morphine? - Yes. Three ampoules of morphine taken out of my bag, enough to kill a man! And a hypodermic. That's easy to find out. We'll ask her. If she is asleep, we could search her room. Ester! Oh! Emmie? It's your paperweight. Yes. Ester! Ester! Ester! Ester! Get me the police! Ester! Open the door. Ester! Ester!! Open the door! (Bird squawk) "Hit him, Anton!" "Hit him! Hit him!" I knew it! - "Hit him Anton!" I knew you would say it! (Bird squawk) Shut up! Shut up! You idiot! (Bird Squawk) (Bird squawking wildly) Go! I'll get you. I'll get you. Ester! Ester! Ester! Ester! Es...! Anton? (bird squawk) Anton? Anton! What's the matter? - Don't! Listen,... it was Salem! Salem killed Emmie! He didn't touch you? Didn't hurt you? Where has he gone? - Come here. Come. Sit down. Sit down here. - Sit here? He killed Emmie! He killed Emmie! - It's no use Anton. Look at this room. You did it. You completely lost your mind! - No, listen to me. Salem was in this room! He killed Emmie! Give me the asylum! Ester, Salem got back into the asylum! He got back in! - What else did you expect? But if he can get out of such a place, why then go back? Salem was here?... You saw him? You'd better stick to that little story, it's your only defense. Defense? What do you mean? I don't need to defend myself! Don't... don't you understand what I'm saying, Salem was in this house and he killed Emmie! Come in, come in please. It's Emmie, my sister in law. - Where is she? She's up here in her room. We found her together. My wife. - Mrs. Jenks. She went down to phone. Then I saw Salem, hiding in the cupboard, almost naked. Right here he was standing when I saw him. Quite mad, quite mad, to kill an innocent woman. Uh,... Did you look her over, Doctor? Why, no. I... saw she was dead We didn't think it wise to touch anything. Hit with considerable violence. No motive. Has to be a maniac. It must have been a great shock to you both to discover her like that. Yes, of course. And Salem was hiding in this cupboard, you say? Yes. Oh, please. This is my wife's bedroom. This is my study. - Would you mind? No, no, no, of course, go ahead. Ah, the famous ties! The famous, uh... Oh, no, no. I see, Torens has told you about them. So many things have happened that I... quite forgot to mention that. My bag was rifled and a... handful of ties stuffed inside. Would you explain that as the action of a sane man? They look clean enough to me. I'm sorry, clean? Oh no, no, you misunderstood, Inspector. I had to invent the story for Mr. Torens. After all, everything was so embarrassing I understand,... ties in a medical bag, it is embarrassing. - Yes. Well, I've seen enough. Let's find my assistant and we'll be off. Alright. Ester... the Inspector's leaving now. I won't trouble you anymore tonight. Of course, that business of the ties reminds me. It's the morphine and the hypodermic that's important! My instruments! What happened to them? - Stolen. Stolen out of my bag! What could he have done with them? Never mind. We'll check that. Try and find them. The police doctor and the ambulance will be here in a minute. Goodnight, Mrs. Jenks. Try and get some rest. Thank you Inspector, good night. I think I handled that rather well. You talk too much! What's that, sir? One of Dr. Jenks' ties. Menthol! Uh-huh. It checks out. Traces of the same mentholated substances on the Torens' girl neck. Uh-huh. No fingerprints. This material doesn't take any, the lab said. Uh... Excuse me, sir, I can't understand why you didn't arrest the doctor? He is our man, it's as clear as a bell. You're quite sure of that, aren't you, Carl? Yes. Well, yes. Obviously the tie is the murder weapon. Well, doesn't it all point to Dr. Jenks? Yes, it does. Yes. Very clearly. The strangest thing of all is his story about Salem suddenly turning up in the middle of the night and killing his own sister. The attendants at the asylum checked and of course, Salem hadn't gotten out. On top of that getting back in again and neatly locking himself in his cell. Now why would the doctor tell such a crazy story? Yes, why? Well, it doesn't make sense. Perhaps it makes... Perhaps it makes a little too much sense. How's that? Two murders. First case, strangulation, weapon silken tie, belongs to Dr. Jenks. Second case. Crushed skull, heavy paper weight, belongs to Dr. Jenks. Prime suspect, Dr. Jenks. Too neat. Too obvious. Motives unknown. Possibility, work of a maniac? Maybe. Maybe. But who is the maniac? Thank you for taking the time, Dr. Kemp. No trouble, but I warn you, it's quite a walk. Get out? Why yes, very simple. If he could fly. Do you think, Inspector, anybody could get down these walls? But one of them broke out about ten years ago? That wasn't a break, Inspector. It was suicide. That is the Occupational Therapy room. It keeps our patients busy. Salem is the tall one in the middle. He did all this? Yes, in therapy. A lot of imagination. Just like Jack and the beanstalk up there. Dr. Kemp... how could Salem get out of here? Yes, I thought you were going to get around to that. Well, it's... quite simple really. First he'd have to unlock this door. But as you can see, the lock is on the outside only. Well, what about this letter box arrangement? That is for trays in case they're confined. But look... the panel opens from the outside. You couldn't reach through to the lock even if it were open. and you'd to have to have a key to begin with. I see. Let's assume the door's left open. I don't like careless assumptions. Let us not base our hypothesis on my negligence. I've got to build on someone's carelessness, so whether you like it or not, I'm going to say you slipped up last night. I'm going to have that door open. Now, where would Salem go? - Simple He comes out into this corridor and this is where he stops! Stay here. This is Doctor Kemp here. I'm on the Top floor with the Inspector. Please, close the doors for a moment. Thank you. It's the same on every wing, every floor. Nine o'clock we lock up. - Any empty cells? Cells he might get into and force a window? Sorry. We've got a full house. And stop giving Salem a whole bunch of keys. I'll give you his door open. But I won't grant that he's got 'round Pop! Pop? Night floor attendant, this wing. That's his office. Bribed... How's that? So Pop is bribed! - Yes. Alright. He's very friendly with Salem. They do play chess together. Let us go so far as to say that Pop has even opened the door for him. Now Pop has done all he can do. He can't even open the gates. Salem is on his own. Remember... it is almost a hundred feet to the courtyard below. A visitor for you, Salem. Can I be alone with him? - Certainly. But don't get into a game of chess with him. You'll never escape! You're from the police, aren't you? I know why you've come. You're in the awkward position of trying to get information from a lunatic. I'm here to talk to you just the same. With an eye towards reconsidering my confinement here? Possibly. I like it here. I'm safe. From whom? - Myself. Would you care for a game of chess? I don't play. What do you mean, yourself? If I were outside I'd kill people. My sister, Ester, and her husband. And how many others? - No others. Oh... Emmie was always kind to me. and generous. She use to send me home made scones. and other things. I'm sorry she had to find out. Find out what? Are you sure you don't play chess? Quite sure and I haven't got all evening, either. Well neither have I. What you were sorry Emmie found out? She found out I never did murder that farmhand. How do you know? Well, why else would Jenks kill her? I'm not sure he did. Oh, yes you are. You just don't know why? What about the girl, Britt Torens? Conscience is a terrible thing. Why don't we just stop amusing ourselves and say what's on our minds? I've kept it to myself until now, haven't I? Britt's dead. So why bring it up? I might be able to get you out of here. I said I'd kill people. There's no policeman in the world who could stop me. What about Britt? "Miss Torens had a charming disposition" the local parson said. She was very popular among the neighbors. And her father was completely heartbroken. So? So it would have been cruel of me to destroy her character in public. I'm not the public. I was with Britt Torens at the time the farmhand was killed. Alone? Alone. She could have said that in court and... you would have been proved innocent? Yes, I think that's the way it might have gone. You're a liar, Salem! Of course I am! There wasn't a finer girl around than Britt. I shouldn't have told you such a thing. But why didn't you tell the court? Although her father would have disowned her. I did hope that Britt would walk into court and speak up of her own accord. Her failure to do so came as a... well, as a revelation. A letdown. Besides, they'd found my axe with my finger prints on it, and blood on the blade, motives and reasons. Didn't I drink too much? Well, you must know the story, Inspector. I don't expect you to prove what I've just said. I don't expect you to get me out of here either. I only hope it'll give you a little food for thought. I understand. You expect me to believe your girlfriend finally got an attack of conscience, went to Jenks and threatened to expose everything. Something like that. Why should she go to Jenks and not the police? You're the policeman, Inspector, you tell me. Sorry, didn't know you had a visitor. Oh, that's all right, Pop. We'll have plenty of time later. I'll have a present for you. Present? - Yes. Later, then. Just like being back at school. We know what we're doing up here. I've had a long time to wonder about the police. I hope you still hold us in your esteem. We appreciate the patience you've shown. You shouldn't be sarcastic. I could kill you with my bare hands and they'd only put me downstairs. This is what they do to me when I talk out of turn, Inspector. How does it feel? How does it feel? No, no, I'm not going to hurt you. Don't struggle. Let me tell you something. I know a good deal of what happened over there last night. We read papers up here, you see. I've been thinking a lot this morning. So let a madman give you some intelligent advice, Inspector. The next man on Doctor Jenks' list will undoubtedly be a worthless lawyer by the name of Clemens. Do you know what two years of thinking has told me? Clemens was paid to change my plea. Because Ester and Anton wanted a conviction. But something has gone wrong in that house now, after two years of watching each other. They are afraid. Ester is telling Anton to kill everyone who might bring the trial open again. By what preposterous evidence do you suppose they will arrange to prove that I have escaped from this place, huh? Well, I don't know. But you'll believe whatever it is, and I'm not worried. But there's one thing I'd like to know your opinion about, Inspector. Do you really believe that anyone would ever return to this howling prison after once getting out? I'd sooner be dead. May I get up? Oh, certainly. Do me one favor, Inspector, don't think Anton is insane. I'm the insane one. You shouldn't believe a word I've said. Mr. Clemens isn't seeing anyone at this hour. Will you kindly tell him it's very urgent. But he's ill. He's in bed with a fever. I'm a police Inspector. It's extremely important. Oh... Well, alright. Come in. You can wait in here. In the library. Mrs. Hansen! Mrs. Hansen! Who the devil is ringing the bell at this late hour? It's the police, sir. - Police? Have you got a search warrant? No, sir. Then what gives you the right to nose through my belongings? Mr. Clemens, have you any reason to believe someone might want to kill you? Of course not! What kind of balderdash is this? Is this what you got me out of bed for? Tell me what you want and get out. It has to do with a trial you're familiar with. The Salem murder case. I believe you changed Salem's plea from not guilty to guilty by reason of insanity. Certainly... Certainly, I did. Why? Because my first duty is to my client. Because I know the difference between prison for life and experienced medical care in a mental institution. Have you ever visited the asylum? What has that got to do with it? Because if you had I don't think you'd be drawing such a fine distinction between the two establishments. What are you driving at? Mr. Clemens, allowing for good behavior what constitutes a life sentence in prison? Twenty... Twenty-five years. And once a man has been certified criminally insane, how long do they put him away for? Until the qualified authority is convinced that his sanity has been restored. Which could mean never. Please tell me by how much did the Jenks' increase your fee for switching? Are you implying that I was bribed? No, I never mentioned the word. But Salem's sister and the Torens girl have been murdered and Dr. Jenks has made accusations against Salem. Why on earth should Jenks' want to bring up Salem's name now? Everybody knows he's been put away. Because Dr. Jenks is most anxious to convince me that Salem was at his farm last night. Jenks said that? But why invent a story like that? I can't imagine. But since you had such a close understanding with him two years ago, it occurred to me that you might be able to explain his behavior. How dare you! Get out! Get out! I really came here to warn you to take care of yourself. And I don't mean your cold. Thank you for the present Salem. It's very kind of you. But, well, well, well... if that's not the strangest set of men I've ever seen. Salem, do you want to spoil my game? I can't play with all those making faces at me! Nonsense. Pull up your chair. I'm going to capture your queen tonight, Pop. No you're not! Oh, it's getting on for nine. I better get closed up and play through the slot. Set them up, while I get my stool! And it's my turn with the white! I don't know. Don't go moving your queen prematurely, Salem. I've warned you about that before. I want to expose her. I know what I'm doing. Have it your own way! I didn't see that move! Then why kick up a fuss? Because that queen of yours keeps pointing at my knight, that's why! I can't stand these men! Salem, I appreciate the trouble you went to, but I just can't stand them. Why don't you get your own set then? Well, it's really too late to go changing, but... I just can't play with these. That knight wasn't there before! When we changed boards you - Pop, you've got to learn to be a good loser. It's checkmate in three moves and you know it, regardless of the queen! Salem, it's no good! I'm not enjoying myself! Because you're losing! It's too late anyway. It's lockup time! Just a moment, Mrs. Hansen. It's Mister Clemens! Mrs. Hansen says he's in a bad way! Whatever it is, tell them I'm making no calls until after the funeral. It seems quite urgent. It might be wise... You should go. - You're right. Tell her I'll be over... right away! He'll be right over. Yes. Good bye. You'd better forget that bird. It must have flown away. I just heard it! I tell you, I heard it! We'll look for it later, dear. It might be in the attic. Right now I think you should get over to Clemens. Alright. The police please. I don't like the sound of that. He's been coughing like that all day. Hello Clemens. How long have you been like this? Mrs. Hansen, I want to talk to this man alone! Get him an blanket and turn up the boiler! This place is as cold as a barn! Don't bother with that stuff, doctor. I didn't call you for doctoring. I've been going through some very interesting files, doctor. Some of the evidence and testimony has taken on a curious light since the death of Emmie. I believe you are delirious. In fact, I'm sure you are! Yes, I'm delirious... just like the police Inspector. Yes, he was here! And I want to know what the devil you've been telling him about me! What are you talking about? I'm talking about the murder of that farmhand two years ago. That's what I'm talking about! The murder you pinned on Salem! And now, you have the unmitigated stupidity to tell the Inspector you saw him in your house! Why, fool! Who do you think is going to believe that? But I did see him! He was there! What do you take the Inspector for? A nincompoop! You certainly made him suspect Salem! He suspects him of having information that could send you away for life. He went to the asylum all right. He went there and found out a lot. A lot about you and your wife! Not about me, Jenks! Why? Because I've got nothing to do with it, never did have! And now that he's making you sweat, you'd better keep your mouth shut about the way I defended Salem! The fee was not exorbitant, nor was it... (coughing attack) Be quiet now. I'm going to take your pulse. What was all the fuss about? Mr. Clemens is delirious. He's within an inch of double pneumonia. He's got to stay in bed. - Will he be all right? - Yes. He's recovering from a coughing attack and I'm going to give him a sedative. Bring me a glass of water please. - Okay. Thank you. Open your mouth now. You'll feel better now. - Go away, I don't want anything Come on. That's right. He will sleep through the night. You shouldn't leave the house. If he gets restless, give me a call. Thank you. Come with me into the study and I will give you a prescription. And tell you what to do, and also what I'd like him to eat during the next few days. Inspector, I'm so relieved. So terribly relieved! I was afraid he'd come back before you came. You mean the doctor's gone out? Where? I made him go. On a call. It's warmer in the kitchen. I sent for you because there's something wrong with my husband. Something horribly frightening! I believe he's insane! Why do you say that, Mrs. Jenks. He actually believes he saw Salem. And you don't think he did? How could he? And now I'm afraid he's going to try to kill me. Here, sit down. Now, why should he try to kill you? Why should he wish to kill your sister? There's something about Emmie no one ever knew. She and Anton, I mean. Please, go on, Mrs. Jenks. Emmie introduced me to Anton. She was always getting him over here. I promise you I had no idea they were planning to use me as soon as I married him Use you? Are you suggesting there was something wrong at the trial two years ago? Yes. And what's more, I don't think Salem is insane, or that he ever was insane. I believe that Emmie and Anton were in this kitchen doing something and that the farmhand came stumbling onto them and they were forced to kill him. I believe they moved the body and put blood on Salem's axe. That's a very serious accusation, Mrs. Jenks. Here in this kitchen. Hm. I mean it was scrubbed clean the night the farmhand was murdered. Shouldn't you have mentioned that at the trial? It just didn't seem important at the time. I did ask Emmie about it. I remember coming in that morning, seeing the floor all scrubbed and cleaned. Even under the stove. Was she upset? - Not at all. She told me she hadn't been able to sleep the night before and that she got up to make herself a cup of hot milk, and she couldn't stand the sight of a dirty floor. Now I wonder what they could have been up to when a farmhand barges in? Of course it's only guesswork and it's pretty late in the day to comment on a dead case. I don't think it is dead, Inspector. You see, Emmie and Anton hated Salem. He didn't let them do anything with the property. He didn't care about money and running things efficiently. And Anton did? - Certainly! Salem was never practical. He just sat and drank. And because he was in control all we could do was watch the profits go down the drain. Emmie didn't like it. And believe me I didn't like it either, but... Emmie took it to heart. She was a grasping woman. always arguing with Salem about... selling this place while prices were high. Let's get back to this kitchen. If you ask me, somebody's been at this floor with a hatchet and it looks burned! Exactly! Emmie handled the insurance! I see! They intended to start a fire in here, burn the place down and collect! The farmhand came in, caught them red handed! So Dr. Jenks goes at him with... with the hatchet! My young friend has a vivid imagination! But I think he's right! (bird squawking) What in heaven's name is that? That's a parrot. That's another thing. Anton's been trying to kill it. Where is it? - I don't know. It got out the night Emmie was killed. Anton's terrified by the bird's voice. Uh, it might not make a sound for hours. You know he's looked through every corner of this house like a lunatic. He even gets up in the middle of the night... What's the matter? That clock doesn't work. Hasn't for years! The hands aren't even connected. Anton's back! He... he used the front door! He's in the house! Waiting! He's been listening! He's going to kill me for talking to you! Nobody's going to kill you. Look around Carl. Well the bird's been here all right. It's dirtier than the cage. It could have started it moving. - No. No, Anton's back here. I know he's back. - He's not here! Where did he go? Where did he go? Clemens'... an hour ago. No!... Don't! Don't!... No! Put it down! You can run away. Run! I won't tell you've been here. You're real, Salem! Yes, I'm insane, Ester. I'm mad! You made sure of that, didn't you? No... I didn't. It was Anton. He did all this to you. I didn't know it before it was too late. It was Anton and Emmie. I know you, Ester. I've tried to help you all these years, Salem. Tried to get you out of that awful prison. But Anton hates you. I understand that you want to kill him. But to kill Emmie... That was a terrible thing to do! Poor Salem. Poor Salem. I'll help you. You can still run away. Just give me the axe and run. I won't tell anyone. I always loved you, you know. Didn't I help you before? And you love me. You're my big brother. So... Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me, now. Don't be silly. Don't you understand, I am trying to help you. Give it to me now, you idiot! No! Aaaaah! Ester! Ester! Ester! No, Salem! No! No! Please! Don't! Don't! Don't! No, no, no! Don't! Don't! No! No! You can't! Please! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop! Oh! Don't! Please! No! No! You can't! You can't! No! No! No! No! The house is empty, sir. No sign of... Doctor Jenks. I've seen them hacked to pieces before, but never like this. Go away. Let them know at the station. Hmm. Inspector! Inspector! Is he gone? Inspector. - Who are you talking about? Salem Oh, he was here again, was he? I think he killed Ester, because I heard her scream and then I didn't hear her anymore. So I have to be very careful because he can get out. In and out. I think it's wise to keep all the doors locked. And how do you think he killed Mrs. Jenks? With the axe, of course. He had to use the axe. To get even. - To get even? Yes. We put blood on his axe. This time he had to wipe it on me. He came out to kill Ester and now he's going back to put the blame on me. I wish I - I hadn't listened to Ester. To even think of burning this place down for the money was madness. And then to... To kill a person because he - he interrupted us! "Hit him, Anton! Hit him!" And I - (sobbing) Tell the sergeant we'll be needing statements from Jenks and Torens. What about you? To the asylum just as fast as I can make it! Doctor Kemp here. Open up! I'm sorry to give you this trouble. No trouble, sir. Can I go in please? - Certainly. Salem! Salem come to supper! (laughing) Salem! Salem! Salem!
