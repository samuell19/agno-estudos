I'm Hung Chin-Pao. Stage name, Yuan Long. I'm their elder martial brother. Without having any breakfast, we begin training every morning at seven. We train until noon before we have anything to eat. The first thing we practise every day is the handstand. It sure is tough. My name's Yuan Ching. I'm in charge of watching the water! Master's coming! Master's coming! Master's coming! Master's coming! Good morning, Master...! Master initiates you into the art. Practice relies on yourself. A youth without training... is an old age of nothing. Train hard now! Stick out your bellies...! Raise your heads...! Hands closer together...! Raise your head! - What are you doing?! - Master, the alarm's ringing! I'm here, so what I say goes! Get back up! Get down! After half an hour of handstands, both your wrists really hurt a lot. At this point, the worst thing is when Master tell us to follow with... the backbend. Backbend! Don't stick your bottom out! Handspring! Handspring somersault! Handspring flip! Tiger leap cartwheel! You call those handsprings? They're only monkey flips! Those are still monkey flips. What are you doing? Master, I dunno how. Then step aside! Master, I dunno either. Go away! Rolling fur, lying tiger! Left and right flying kicks. Enough! That's about it for today. - Sammo? - Yes?! When I'm not around, you will lead the others in training. - Show the little ones how to handspring. - Yes, Master! Thank you for your hard work, Master...! CHINESE ARTS TROUPE PERFORMING IN HONG KONG Sometimes when Master's not around, I lead the others in training. Master will be in the den downstairs. Left and right flying kicks! Left and right flying kicks. Handspring. Handspring flip. Three handsprings, one somersault. Tiger leap cartwheel. They're doing pretty well. Like they say, 'Frequent the mountains and you're bound to meet a tiger.' One day, we were in big trouble. Get up. Get up! Get up! - Get up! Get up... Get up... - Master! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Master! I told you to lead the training. You lead them in loafing off?! - Sorry, Master! - Sorry? Sorry?! Everyone get down! - Handstand! - Yes! Everyone practise somersaults! What are you doing over there? Come out! Master, I won't do it again! Master, I won't do it again... Tears before the rod, how undistinguished. Get in line! Raise your head! Master... I can't hold on... Can't hold on! - Martial Brother...?! - Stay back! How come my sweat's so hot? Fetch the shredded tobacco! Suppress his wound! After that day, even when master wasn't around, we didn't dare slack off ever again. Now you do it! One leads into the next. Hurry up! Go! Hurry up! Keep going! One after the other! Time is like an arrow. It flies forward, never backward. The past is only ever an echo. LIN GUNG MARTIAL ARTS TRAINING Director: SAMMO HUNG In the past... the four words 'the udumbara blooms ephemeral'... were ones for which I did not have much affection for. Good morning! Good morning. Stand...! Good morning, classmates. Good morning, Headmaster...! It appears one classmate is still not quite on his feet yet. Fellow classmate, how come you-- Sorry. My apologies. I wasn't aware that you were actually... actually so short. My apologies. Headmaster, you don't have to mind so much, the whole class always calls me 'Shorty'. Then why don't you... you sit here in the front, all right? While you, who have grown so tall, can see the blackboard from the back. Well, then! Sit down. Our lesson today is on written composition. Can any classmates tell me-- Listen to the question, then raise your hand! Sorry! I spilled water on your trousers. - Let's get them changed, shall we? - Okay. Come on. Mind your step. Here, return the trousers you're wearing now to me tomorrow. - O...kay... - All right? Good boy! Here. - Thank you, Miss Wong...! - That's a good boy. - Thanks! - You're welcome. - You three! - Hands off...! Stand up! Why can't the three of you just pay attention for one lesson?! If you really dislike studying that much, shall I ask the headmaster to let you withdraw, then? Sure! Give us our tuition fees back and we'll withdraw! I've changed three five dollar notes, Headmaster. Thank you, Sister Lin. Take it back. Take it back. Take it back. I won't expel you from the school. Take the five dollars back first. At the start of the month of every month... you do not have to pay your tuition fees. Save it up. At the end of the month, come to the headmaster's office... and give it to me directly. If when the times comes... you have been naughty, or you have spent your tuition fees and so cannot pay them... I will waive your tuition fees, and immediately... expel you from the school. This is all your fault...! You wanted to see the headmaster...! I reckon this is all your fault...! Stealing my milk cap cards...! - Why you blaming me...?! - Oi, why'd you push me...?! Run! - Oh, this one? Sure. This one. That one. - No, that one. - Here! - Two of 'em...! Two of 'em? Alright, both are beauties...! Yeah? Hey?! Miss Wong?! Yee? You're running the stall on your own? It smells great...! Wanna try the sweet soup?! It won't cost ya...! - You're too kind! It's all right. - C'mon! Don't make it hard on me now! - Boss Lady?! - Yes?! - Lend me a seat, yeah? - Help yourself! You get a free egg... Thank you. Bigger bowl! Bigger bowl! The headmaster's too thin. - Thank you, Sister Lin. - Thanks! 'Hare was fast but lace'-- 'Lazy' not 'lace'...! 'Hare reached the midpoint but did not keep going.' 'Tortoise might have been slow, but he was very calm.' 'He stood at the top of the slope, retracted head and legs into his shell, 'and took a great leap'...! 'Rolling down the slope just like a rock'! 'In the end, when Tortoise and Hare crossed the finish line, 'they hurried'... Oh no, spelt 'hare' wrong. Aren't you Shorty? I am! I'm the class monitor. - Oh, Class Monitor...! - Haven't seen you in ages! - Whoa, you've changed a lot! - About the same! - He's the same! - Yeah! Recognised him right away! - Headmaster's here. - Headmaster! - Headmaster! - Headmaster. - Headmaster...! - Headmaster! Happy birthday! - Happy birthday...! - Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Do you remember this? We weren't allowed to stay in the classroom during break, right? Well, three of our classmates sneakily stayed behind once. When we got back, the fluorescent light was smashed. Do you know why? They were tossing scissors around! They were tossing and tossing 'em, got too excited and smashed the light! Yeah, I remember! These three were the naughtiest in the class. - Especially you, Yee. - Me again?! One time, they were playing milk cap cards during class and Miss Wong caught them. All three of them ended up in the headmaster's office. - Right! I remember. - Remember that? We were too scared to be naughty after that. Headmaster? What I remember the most about you three... was I didn't bother giving you reports after graduating. - Hey, Ying? That's you, isn't it? - Is it? - Oh, yeah... That's me! - Me! Me! Me! - So short! Look how short you are! - Hey, it's Headmaster...! - There's Shorty. Shorty's in this one. - He really is the shortest. Really is. Hey, hey? Where did we take this one? Oh, this one, don't you remember? Class Monitor got into CUHK. So we all got together to go check out the campus. That's when we took it. Remember...?! Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it! - Oh, Miss Wo-- It's Miss Wong. - Yeah, Miss Wong. Miss Wong. It's Miss Wong. I remember one time, I set up shop on the side of the street, hawking toy swords and stuff. Miss Wong quietly came up to me and went, 'Run like hell'. Then I saw a cop coming my way. I packed everything up in a scramble. I ran and I ran. Stuff kept falling out and falling out. Miss Wong kept picking it up and picking it up. Then Miss Wong dragged me into a teahouse, and we pretended to have yum cha. - So when the cop came in, it was fine. - She saved you! Before my second child was born, I thought I'd give Miss Wong a call. I could tell from her voice she was doing it tough. So I went and visited her in hospital... and she kept telling me not to take any proprietary Chinese medicine because she said she once had a fall and tried out these bear bile tablets. She didn't know that bear bile tablets damage your kidneys though, and she's always had a weak heart. So when my second child was born, I rang Miss Wong to tell her the news. Her family told me that she had already passed away. I also visited Miss Wong one time after graduating. I once asked her in class why she wasn't married, right? She told me that her health was poor and she was always falling ill. She knew her life would be short, so she didn't want to burden anyone. - That's why she decided not to marry. - So that's why... As for phrases akin to 'The udumbara blooms ephemeral'... I can only recall... 'the pine and cypress stay evergreen', 'the chrysanthemum is unwavering in frost', 'the plum blossom abides the cold'. Weeds with their unbeautiful flowers and leaves... even they do not live and grow... for the sake of humans to see. On this earth, there are even more flowers, plants, and trees... that do not live and die of themselves. Whether people see it or not... the udumbara must eventually bloom. Countless flowers, plants, and trees... do not pass over their own growth. They bloom. They bear fruit. They propagate. Generation after generation existing like so. Hello...? Hello, Headmaster?! It's Yee. I've found Miss Wong's grave. - You've found it? - Yeah! - Is it hard to find? - Not really. Ah, yes... Where are you now? I'm at the cemetery. - This early? - Yeah... I have to be at work soon. Then you hurry off to work. All right? Oh, yeah! Are we all getting together to visit Miss Wong? GRAVE OF YOUNGER SISTER WONG SIU-FONG BORN 28/3/1942, DIED 15/2/1983 Headmaster. Miss Wong's over here. Miss Wong, this one's from me. HAAU JEUNG TWO YOUNG PEOPLE, YIP KA-LAM AND YU NGAN-FEI, FELL IN LOVE IN THE STILL BEAUTIFUL TWILIGHT OF 1980s HONG KONG. WITH HER FAMILY'S EMIGRATION OVERSEAS, THE TWO COULD ONLY SUFFER THE BITTERNESS OF PARTING. ALL THAT REMAINS NOW ARE THE MEMORIES OF THEIR LOVE. BIT YE ANOTHER NIGHT A plane fell into the ocean last year. If it didn't fall, and crashed into us instead, me and Yu Ngan-Fei would be together forever. Even now, I can't deny that Yu Ngan-Fei was my first love. Although the time we spent together was not as long as we intended, I never would've guessed how much of an impact it would have on me. We didn't go to the same school. Hers was a prestigious school. Mine was just an ordinary one. So it really was fate that brought us together. But so what if it was fate? Fate eventually runs out someday. In the end, she still had to leave all the same. Many people say that first loves always have a bad ending. However, when love does show itself, we leap into it without a second thought, not caring how it'll end. There's a first time for everything. Unfortunately, the first time is also never the last time. But how could I have guessed that going out with Yu Ngan-Fei would be my first time, and my last. Yu Ngan-Fei is my first time... my only dream. Hello? I'm leaving the day after tomorrow. I want to see you. Can you come and see me? I only have tomorrow left. What time? The afternoon. Come up to my place, okay? Yip Ka-Lam, where do you think you're going?! Please shut the door. You wanna let burglars in or something?! There's still stuff worth stealing here now? Do you really not want to see me that badly? Yes. - You still wanna leave? - The one who's leaving is you, not me! Why are you taking it out on me? It's not like I wanna leave. If you really can't bear it, why a week without seeing me? I go looking for you at school; you avoid me. I wait outside your house; you don't come home. I write to you; you don't reply. I call you; your mum says you're not in! Do you have to avoid me this way? Just where have you been? I'm really scared! You're leaving, so why do you even care where I am? Why have you refused to see me? Do you not like me anymore...? I just want to get used to what it's like with you not there. What is it like, then? I don't know what it's like. I don't have the words. Don't be like this. I can't be without you. - Can't you just stay?! - Can't you just stay?! I shouldn't have come up here. Seeing you makes it even harder for me! And it's not hard for me?! How is it hard when you get to leave? When you get there, you'll soon forget me. Soon you'll forget all about Hong Kong...! I'm not leaving anymore. Sound good? - Your mum and dad okay with that? - No. But I'm already eighteen. No one can boss me around anymore. I'll do whatever I want. I'm not letting you leave! You're staying here with me tonight! If I'm not leaving, you can't either! - The phone...! - Ignore it. Answer it. Maybe it's important. Don't you dare move! Hello? Hello?! Hello?! ON THE ISLAND, I WISH TO PERPETUALLY STAY THIS NIGHT IS A TENDER NIGHT Memory is the most abundant time, The one and only truth The now is also encompassed in memory Rooted in the earth, To the earth it must return Come Come to my side, Nestled twixt mountain and sea Come I am mountain, I am sea, I am all you desire I hold you close You have returned to an ancient dream Hey?! Don't use it. There's only one left! I wanna photograph you! Sit over there! Don't move now. I've waited a whole week just to take this photo. Happier... Give us a smile! I can't manage a smile. Hey, did you know? I didn't move anything on purpose. It's all here. I wanted you to see my room. Something to remember me by. You look happier getting the photo than you are seeing me. Guess I can leave now. Your first time here and you're leaving like that?! Is that any way to treat me?! The first time? Sure, for you it's the first time. But for me, it's the last. Don't you realise what a joke you are? The whole house is empty-- you're leaving! Yet you've left everything here, deluding yourself that nothing's changed. Yu Ngan-Fei... Wake up, will ya?! Yip Ka-Lam. Can you be more mature about this? Why do you think my mummy and daddy are leaving? They're doing it for me! If you really do love me, you could've come over to see me! I can't be without you or this place, so I took a photo. Now when I'm missing you, I can still see you. I want you to be a part of my world forever! Do you even know how I feel about you? Do I realise what a joke I am?! Am I joke to you?! Do you know how hurtful your words are...? Come on... Don't be like that. Why don't we have a cup of tea, eat a bun, and chew the fat? Drop the Stephen Chow act! You're still in the mood to be funny? Where will you be living in England... when semester starts? On campus. Will it take some getting used to? Of course it will, with you not there... I'll be taking all these with me. When I'm missing you, I can read them. You have to write to me. I came here the night before. I had a dream... I came here. You weren't here. Suddenly, you opened the door and came in holding your luggage. You told me that you weren't leaving anymore... that you had a falling out with your family... that you would be with me forever, never leaving my side. Why don't we die together? Let's die together. Okay. 'Okay' what? You got me this CD on our very first date. Ever-changing night, Like a diamond bright, So cold that it bites A thousand neon streams, Wake a thousand dreams, Reflect the harbour lights Tears in my eyes, why oh why? In the stillness I can finally sigh You should disappear, disappear, And never ask why The road it will not last Shouldn't walk so fast Don't want this to end I ask you to stay, Hold this waking dream In your arms to mend If I lose you, Hard to bear, hard to bear A thousand cold eyes stare Hear the northern wind, Cold it blows Keep me in your arms, Hold me close The dress flaps in the wind like a romance There are times we have no chance Lonely black kerchief, floating in the wind, In the harbour dance Out from a thousand neon lights I gaze A ferry far off in the haze The northern wind whistles 'round, But I can't feel its cold roar For tonight my cold heart feels no more I have to go. Take care of yourself now. Can't you just stay? I want to do it with you. My first time has to be with you. I need to remember you, this place, and this night forever. Don't-- Don't be like this...! We're out of time! What do you take me for? Do you know how selfish you're being? You're leaving tomorrow. I'm supposed to stay here and do what? I can't leave even if I wanted too! Yu Ngan-Fei, have you considered my feelings? We'll do it and you'll just act like nothing's happened, is that it?! Hey?! Where are you running off to?! Stay back! What do you want, Yu Ngan-Fei? I want to jump. Even at this moment, you're being so selfish! What are you trying to say? You just wanna leave me behind. You don't actually love me! You don't believe I'll jump?! I don't believe it. I'm sorry. Let's go back downstairs, okay? The blue sky gazes at me I observe the night The night observes languid and limitless The feelings collect as a canopy Listen to the murmurs of the night Dreams are not easy to grasp A dream has grasped me You and I are flying within the dream On the island, on the island, I wish to perpetually stay Love awakens from its afternoon nap This night is a tender night Many people say that first loves always have a bad ending. However, when love does show itself, we leap into it without a second thought, not caring how it'll end. There's a first time for everything. Unfortunately, the first time is also never the last time. Yip Ka-Lam is my first time... my only dream. BIT YE ANOTHER NIGHT 1995 WUSHU CHAMPIONSHIPS: CHAMPION I, Wong Fei-Hung, do not believe in violence and killing. I much prefer talking things through. - Allow me to take a seat... - That Wong Fei-Hung... He sure has the virtues of a martial artist! ...an act of charity for this place of yours. Yes?! - Dad. - Still here?! - We're about to board. Piglet there yet? - Not yet! Oh, yeah! Her classmates know she's immigrating to Canada, so they're gonna have a big get together. You'll have her around to take care of you for a bit. She can finish her exams, then I'll arrange for her to come here. I don't need nobody to take care of me...! I've taken care of myself all these years! Leave it to me! I'll keep a close eye on Piglet. Dad! She doesn't like being called 'Piglet'...! Alright! I know, I know! - See ya! - Dad?! - Grandad! - Oh, Piglet?! Ugh, my name's Samantha. 'Whatsamatta'? Bet you love it, huh...? Huh? You don't love it? You loved it when you were little! Well, you said it yourself when I was little...! I was only single-digits then. Now I'm in my teens! - Of course, I've changed. - Huh? Things change? Like me, I love kung fu. Over twenty years later, I still love kung fu. If you don't like it, I'll just change it, then. No, no! I like it, I like it! It'll be just like old times! Ah! That's right. I bought some rice noodle roll and red bean puddings. I'll get you some! Whoa, get it while it's hot...! Whoa! Nice and hot! Oi... It's no good for you cold! - It's okay, I got a burger. - Oh, geez... How's this whitey stuff any good? Have some rice noodle roll. I don't like rice noodle roll though... Then... eat the red bean pudding. I'll throw this away for ya. Should be more grateful for having food. What a shame it's actually pretty good, huh? Grandad?! I was originally gonna leave after my exams. But Dad told me to keep you company a while. Grandad needs company now?! If you need to fly, fly! Ooh... Grandad, you ate my burger? You made me eat red bean pudding! How's this whitey stuff anywhere as good as red bean pudding?! Old gamecock's gonna fight till the end. Oi? Sit down for dinner. Come on. Have some fish. Thanks. Grandad, it's really fishy...! Oi...! Don't spit it out. Be grateful for having food. No! There's bones! Then... have the vegetables. Eat some vegetables. Awfully plain...! Got any eggs? Nope. I'll buy some tomorrow. Don't worry about it, then! I'll make instant noodles later. Don't have that either. Grandad doesn't eat unhealthy stuff. Eat your dinner. Grandad, the rice is really hard! Grandad doesn't eat soft rice. Eat! Thank god I'm not staying here long. Am I gonna miss it here? What I'll miss the most is gabbing on the phone with you...! We'll only have email! Remember to reply to me. Hey, where were we again? Question two in section A1-- Geez! Geez... Oh, nothing, just my grandad. Talk to you later. Bye-bye! Grandad? You should knock! Hmph, we're grandfather and granddaughter, who cares?! Well, I am a girl...! Understood, understood. Grandad was curious, wanted to see how you pull off talking on the phone and studying at the same time! Grandad? If you're here, how can I study? Well... Well, I'll leave you to it, then. I'm going now. There. I knocked, alright? Don't stay up too late! Oh no, no, no, no...! What's wrong, what's wrong?! Just come in...! Are you alright? - Why didn't you wake me up?! - Oi, you didn't tell me to wake you! Let me help you. - I start exams today... - Really? Then get a move on. Chop chop! - Go, go, go, go! - Where's my shoe?! I'll find it for ya! - Oh, calculator, calculator?! Oh, geez! Your shoes's right here! Sit down, sit down! Put it on, put it on. Geez... Why don't I take you to school? - No, you look like Wong Fei-Hung...! -What's wrong with that?! Enough, enough! I'm late...! Oh, geez! You're forgetting everything. Piglet?! You left a book, Piglet! You stepped on my foot, it really hurts... Well, my foot's badly injured... You're paying my medical fees! Let go, I'm in a hurry-- I need to teach you a lesson or I won't be able to live with myself! Take the book! Grandad... You're only Mr Wong, not Master Wong. - What's it to you, old fart...?! - 'Old fart', huh? Apologise! Speak Chinese! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - Not to me, to her! Miss, I'm sorry. I'm sorry... Scram! Oh, geez! Grandad?! Grandad?! Grandad... Are you alright? - Grandad's alright. Go to your exam. - Will you be okay?! Grandad will be fine. Get going to your exam. - You're really okay?! - It's fine...! - I'm heading off, then. Be careful! - It's fine, Grandad can walk. - It's fine! Grandad can walk! - You... take care! - You... You be careful too! - Take care! Be careful! All I did was give the guy a kick... I end up with a twisted ankle too?! You're getting old. You're really getting old... Never would've guessed my grandad could pack such a punch! Heh, you think I'm some pushover? See my trophy? That thing's the real deal...! 1995 WUSHU CHAMPIONSHIPS: CHAMPION Over twenty years ago, I could fight ten guys at once. Just now, having to fight three... Oh, I'm all outta breath. I'm old now... Well, over twenty years ago, you were only in your twenties. Now you're several times that. Fighting three at once isn't too shabby! Grandad, you're really something! You're tellin' me! I have no idea what your old man's thinking. He quit his corporate job. He even sold his house. Now he's gone off somewhere else to start all over again. What for? Grandad? Why aren't you coming with us? The hell am I leaving for...? I don't speak English or understand it. I don't know how to drive. If I went over there, I'd be deaf, mute, and crippled...! Oh...! So what if you don't know English? I'll teach ya! Eh?! Then I'll teach you a few moves. That way you won't get picked on. Alright! I'll teach you English, you'll teach me kung fu. Problem solved! Geez... I'm getting on in my years, what am I learning English for? You can't teach an old dog new tricks! This means 'apple'. 'A' for ping gwo No. So ping gwo in English is... - Wait... - What is it? - I can't keep up, Grandad...! - Grandad knew you couldn't keep up. Alright, alright! I'll do it slowly for ya! C'mon... App... appal! I'm done learning! First like this. Horse stance! - Horse stance. - Good! One, two, three. That's it! Mmm... Correct! You got it! Now for 'B'! Now, 'B' is for 'boy'. Correct. - Grandad, was that good? - Very good! You can protect yourself now. Grandad? I'm leaving tomorrow. When you've arrived... write me a letter to say you got there safely, alright...?! I can just give you a call. Long-distance calls aren't cheap! Write to me! May you forgive me for parting ways, Sailing far off on my own Who wants to softly say goodbye, Distant and alone? A, B, C... I really can't do it. Better to stay here and keep you company. Am I right? If in one's life was such a choice, Who could see it through? Yes or no, Who has more to say? Love and hate, Who knows of dismay? When I go, It might be it In our dreams Is where we'll stay But you know that we'll be parting ways THREE YEARS LATER Pain is always at your side Even if choice is lost in life, Hold your chest up with pride Who is it?! Coming, coming...! - Speak Chinese. - Surprise...! Oh...! Piglet?! It really is a surprise. What a surprise! C'mon... Sit down, sit down. Been a few years since I last saw you. You've gotten prettier! Let's go to yum cha. Daddy and mummy are getting a table. Oh, aren't we having hamburgers? You like eating rice noodle roll though! We've also had a few years of burgers now. We can take a break. Give me a moment. Let me change first. Let's go, let's go. Let's go! Cropped trousers? A colourful Hawaiian shirt...?! Do I look cool? Very cool...! Cool... But I think your old look was better. Mind your step. You're not leaving this time? Daddy and mummy said we're back to keep you company! I don't need nobody to keep me company... You do, you do! It's much livelier with the whole family together! Right, right... Much livelier! Much livelier... Piglet? Remind me to buy some flower pagoda cakes when we come by a herbalist. What are you buying flower pagoda cakes for? Getting rid of those millennium bugs...! WUI GWAI RETURN YUEN WAH, ASHLEY LIN Director: YUEN WOO-PING C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Five seventy-five. It was only three fifty before lunch though! Thirty thousand. Five seventy-five, 5,217 shares... If it hits eight bucks... We'll make about four grand each! You selling any?! We putting up the cash? - Current value or market value? - What's that? Excuse me, hold on. 'Current' is the price it's at now. 'Market' is whatever price when available! It's hit six bucks. - Sorry, we'll get back to you. - Six bucks?! Is it really gonna hit eight bucks...?! According to the insiders. Iced milk tea. - Iced lemon tea. - Shop's in Wan Chai. Phone cases and ringtones, look me up! I really don't get it. How do dot-coms make money? They'll change the future how? 'The way companies get rich on the internet is not through profits. 'Experts and investors recognise "bright prospects" 'as well as an indescribable sense of appeal. 'Most internet companies make losses. It could be seen as a bottomless pit. 'However, they currently seem to have little trouble raising capital.' In the future, whip out your phone and you're online! Watch movies, listen to music, check emails, book seats, read the news, check the market, do banking-- Quit yapping, Buffett's not in and even tore into it...! It's way too risky... Investing in dot-coms is progress. Keep up or fall behind! Without risk, would Columbus have found America?! He was trying to get to India though. I'm still a bit scared... If people are scared, why are they settling for two thousand shares when they paid for three million? We should've bought at three fifty. Now we've all made four grand less. What if I've maxed out my card though? Whoa... It's already hit six ten? - Hey, how much did you get in at? - Three fifty! - Then why aren't you selling? - Why would I?! The experts say this thing's worth 40 bucks! I'll start thinking about it when it hits 30 bucks...! See...?! It's six thirty now. Call him! We can put up six forty and still rake in two grand or so. Hello, bro? Help us put up six forty. It's at six eighty? Oh, we have to put up seven bucks?! Seven bucks?! What's left to eat?! We'll even make a loss on the interest. Whoa! It hit seven twenty-five? Seven thirty-five. It's even seven fifty now...! Raise the stakes! What stakes...? Uh... Yes, sorry about that. We'll get back to you. - Mum will only lend me ten grand. - I'm scared...! I'm only blabbering. I'm broke. Shit! What?! If you're okay, I'll make it happen! That can't be right... Six twenty-five? Did it take a laxative? Six bucks?! Can it really hit eight bucks? That's what Chubby said! Are you nuts?! Five eighty-five?! Hello, bro? Five seventy-five. You want in? Uh... We want out.

Block E's the best deal. 462ft, 550 grand. They all want money, not property. The best deal: block E! Now, you can't... T-t-t-there's no inspection, alright? - Oh... Ask the owner if they'll go lower. - The market's bottomed out! Land's two grand a square foot! This is already at cost. Hello, Mrs Chan? I have a client interested in your unit. I wanted to ask if you can go any lower. The owner's asking how low you wanna go. Five forty! Five forty. Okay! Five twenty. Uh... Five twenty. Okay! Five hundred! What about 500, then? Okay! Original price, about a million. Now half off. Five hundred grand... 30% down payment is 50 grand each! With a ten-year mortgage... 1,750 a month each! With a 20-year mortgage, it's 970 each! - Hold it! - Miss... You're from Amoy, don't come in! - We ran off cos we were scared! - Go away! Go away! The owner says four ninety is okay too! It's an investment. We're not living there, right? Relax! It'll only go up! Cheaper than building it yourself...! This just in. A Department of Health tour bus has arrived at Amoy block E. Residents with their belongings are lining up to board. They're going to a quarantine camp...! They're watching the news. The owner says four fifty is okay too! When boarding the bus, residents look particularly helpless. It's so cheap, you're not turning it down, are ya?! It's so cheap, who wouldn't turn it down?! Just when will we reach the end of the tunnel? I can't! If I let you in my house, they'll kill me! Then let us stay in your shop overnight. Is that okay? Overnight?! Do you want me to close down?! If anything happens to my shop, I'm done for! I'm begging you here. Just go away! Just go and leave me alone... Go away...! Are we being too paranoid? DUE TO SARS, PROPERTY PRICES DROP TO HISTORIC LOWS. MAY 2003, AVERAGE PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT IS HKD1,906. APRIL 2019, AVERAGE PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT IS HKD16,397, A 760% INCREASE. Yep. Alright. Sure. Hey, thank you, thank you! Thanks a lot! These tips are the real deal! They control the market. Said these'll go up in the next few days. Braised Tofu roast pork rice, thanks! Curry beef brisket rice! - Fish soup rice noodles, please. - Write the numbers down yourself...! China–Hong Kong through train. Divert those northern waters south. An unlimited flow of capital. Some Mainlander with a billion to spare could enter the market at any time! 'Through train'? When's it arrive though...? By the time you find out, it'll be long gone...! What if it doesn't make it through? Merrill Lynch has a report, Millions of Mainland Investors Coming to Hong Kong. 'Mainland residents can now'... 'Can now' what? Hang on...! It's still loading... What? You've downloaded it already! Still gotta load after downloading! 'Mainland residents can now use RMB to purchase foreign exchange, 'allowing for direct investment in overseas securities. 'Furthermore, the previous USD50,000 purchase limits no longer apply.' Even the big banks have faith. 'The highest number of Mainland investors was 8% in 2002–2003, 'and 5% in 2005–2006.' When the through train comes, think it'll only be 5%? Only 8%...?! But I heard subprime mortgages in the US are in real trouble. I heard the US Government, Wall Street, and the credit raters have swept the crisis under the rug. Their market's been going boom, making over a hundred billion every day. China–Hong Kong through train is welcome rain for the mortgage crisis! Americans spend future money and like to borrow. The Chinese like to save money, have it work for them. Even Lee Shau-Kee was wrong about SOE stocks. Don't overthink it! If you're not coming, I'm still all in. Watch it double. Even the government's investing more in stocks. How much is 'all in'? A hundred grand. A hundred grand each! Sure! Yes... Yes. 0761. Yep. 5190. Yep. 9413. Yep. Current value. Yes, a hundred grand on each. Wait for it to double, please. Yes... Yes. Great, thank you! No problem! Thanks a lot! Ice cream sundae. Fruit salad. Borscht. These aren't ours, right...? What now...?! 0134, 8547, and 6012, yeah...?! Daydreamers! It should've been this one... What did we buy, then? 0761 'Fun Fun Amusement Park'. 5190 'Mega Electronics'?! 9413 'Dreamchase Holdings'. What are these? We're dead. His line's busy. Keep trying. Curry beef brisket's going up! Braised tofu roast pork and fish soup's also booming. They're in the top ten gainers too. We really hit a bullseye with our eyes closed? - Ninety-six. - New mini storage. Check it out. Your change, your change! Hey, hey? Hey?! Let's go all in again, buy the other three as well! Mum will only lend me a hundred grand. - Forget it! Greed turns to paranoia. - I'm only joking! I'm broke! - We'll wait to cash in. Bye-bye! - I'm off. Hey...?! Mini storage. Very neat and tidy! I'll get outta your hair. Bye-bye, bye-bye! Hey, a new mini storage. I'll leave you to it! NOVEMBER 2007, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HALTS 'HONG KONG STOCKS THROUGH TRAIN'. 2008, THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS HITS. THE HANG SANG INDEX DROPS FROM 31,958 POINTS TO 10,676 POINTS. 2018, THE HANG SANG INDEX REACHES NEW HIGHS, HITTING 33,484 POINTS. PIN DEI WONG GAM STREETS PAVED WITH GOLD Where are you?! Where am I...? Excuse me, can you-- Excuse me. Oh, mister? Can you please-- Sorry, sorry! I'm at the pier. I caught the ferry here. Are you at Central Pier?! I guess...! I haven't been here in so long. It's all changed. Can you see City Hall? Hello? Hey?! Can't see a damn thing! Excuse me, excuse me. Is this Central Pier? Why don't I see City Hall. Oh... Go straight along that bridge to get there. Got it? That way. Catch a taxi over, okay? Alright, alright... - Queen's Theatre in Central, thanks. - They tore that down ages ago! Just take me where it was! Boss, the traffic there's really bad! It's quicker if you walk the overpass. Hey? Boss, get out and chat all you want! Get out. I'll wait for you here. Take your time. Oh, don't wait up. You guys go shopping. - I wanna see how much has changed. - Now you tell me. Call me when you're nearby, then! Your old man's a bit of a dope. He's lost. Wasn't it better here in the past? In the past?! Before you were born, this all here was the sea! There was nothing, not even City Hall! This spot here used to be the closest to the sea. Central Pier was our old landmark. Tearing it down and renovating it was like demolishing an ancestral hall. Where's Mum? There's no one and nothing left in Hong Kong! What's left is practically all gone...! She refuses to come back! Yeah, kneel down! Good! That's it... That's it! Bride needs to be cuter! Look at me, look at me! That's it. You call that a wedding? All the tradition's gone! Forget tradition...! If we don't westernise, we fossilise! Even our children say we're old fashioned. That's right! The progress of society. Like digital cameras...! Photos at the click of a button. No developing, saves time and effort. But we've been using film for so long. It must be good for something! Sir, smoking's not allowed here. Really? Do you know where this is? This is City Hall, the spot we're at right now! What's that got to do with me? Smoking's not allowed here. Why are you allowed to sell and buy them, but not smoke them? Huh?! Where'd the files go? - No way! The photos are gone?! - No... You kidding me?! We've been at it all day. - Now what?! - Relax, relax! - Can you recover them? - Sure. Relax, relax. It's so noisy. I can't hear you...! Are you at the Queen's Theatre?! - The theatre's gone... - I know! So what else can you see? - People! Cars! And a lot of buildings! - What else is there...? People...! Cars...! Why are you so upset? I told you to spend New Years in England! I'm coming to get you. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?! Why are you swearing? I'm not swearing! (Fucking mofos!) You're still doing it...! Daddy, you shouldn't swear. I'm not...! Can't hear the loud part. Hears the quiet part perfectly! I just sent you a WeChat message. Did you get it? Our location's on the map. Alright, alright. Stay there, I'm coming. Mister? Those are some nice shoes. Back from England? It is the New Years! I come back every year to see the villagers. After New Years, everyone's gone! A property developer's bought the area. Young man... The future belongs to you lot. You call the shots now. What a beautiful house. My old man built it in 1954! Can we take a look inside? You wore a Chinese bridal two-piece? How traditional! It was antiquated as hell... Should've had a holiday wedding! All that kneeling did my legs in. Honey... I'll make it up to you someday with a western-style wedding photo shoot. I've been hearing you say that since before my hair turned grey. Hey, make way! - Fucking mofos... - Don't you start swearing! You alright? Then let's go. - Let's get one together. - Photo time, photo time, photo time! Oi?! The God of the Soil's here! My name's not 'Hello'! Could you turn the music down a little? Hey?! Don't play near the God of the Soil. Your daddy doesn't like it, okay? Bye! Dad... Our home was so small. You used to put up with me listening to rock. It was loud as hell. I couldn't put up with my son today. Now I know how good you were to me. Do you still remember what I told you? I remember... I've told my son as well. Whatever happens, a happy life is the most important thing of all. Our son wants to go work in America. Sure! There's so many guns there, people get shot to death every day! You...! Don't allow him to go. - Tell him to find work here in Hong Kong! - Sure...! What kind of job should he look for? Invest in gold, invest in silver, invest in property. He'll be rich! What if he loses everything? This is all his fault! He won't take over the business. Do we have it so bad? He's not working. We get to spend more time together as a family! Kid Hello?! Kid Hello?! Mum's got a headache. See if she needs to go to hospital. Does it hurt a lot? Is this where it hurts? So? Is Daddy letting me go to America? It really hurts. It hurts a lot! Watch out. - Take care of Mummy for me. - Okay. I will. No problem. It's New Years. Settle the restaurant's debts for me. I know. Take care of yourself. Hmm? - Call me when you get to England. - Got it. - Happy New Year! - Good girl! Good girl, Li'l Wah! What do you want to be when you grow up? No answer? None of you know? - Li'l Wah, what do you want to be? - I wanna be a director! Wow, aren't you smart? Do you know what a director does? RING OUT THE OLD, RING IN THE NEW YEAR Your old man likes the quiet. He just needs the mountains and the water. Why not take Daddy back to England? There's mountains and water everywhere. It's also cheaper to buy a plot. He loves Hong Kong. Can you hear that?! Your old dad's swearing. No... He's saying it's not easy making a living. When you have the time, get some rest. Spend more time with your family. If you're able, help those in need. Remember... living a happy life is meant to be very simple. THERE ARE MANY PLACES EVEN BETTER THAN HONG KONG, BUT NONE WITH THE AFFECTION I HAVE FOR MY HOMETOWN. MAI LOU LOST Director: [RINGO LAM] A CERTAIN MENTAL HOSPITAL EMOTION CHEUNG Now, you... you are the patient from area A, floor 4, room 8. CHEUNG TAT-MING For today's treatment, I'll be asking you some routine questions. So for each question, you must answer within three seconds. The first question, you are... Ann Hui. You said three seconds. That was three seconds! I hadn't finished! - What I actually want to ask you-- - Ann Hui. You ask me the same thing every day. If I am nuts, I'm not that nuts, right?! Don't you know Ann Hui is a woman? No shit, my mum's a woman! Of course, Ann Hui's a woman. Go ask your mum if she's a woman or not! Hey, then are you a man or a woman? Huh? So what if I'm a woman? Are you discriminating against women?! A woman can't be a director now?! - I am a director, you-- - Fine. Calm down, alright? Now, according to medical science, men and women have different sex organs. Wha...? How can I calm down? You're threatening me with organs! To be perfectly frank, how can I threaten you with organs? Although you are nuts, I still have to go over this with you... as this is both medical fact and backed up by science. Science? Don't you know science has destroyed much of the Earth? You'll bully me with science?! Fine, fine! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Wanna turn me into a cyborg? Here comes the cyborg! Now, science's contributions can be beneficial to mankind, like in environmentalism. I support environmentalism. And so, we all need to protect this Earth of ours. We must oppose pollution, oppose warfare, safeguard world peace, okay? If you talk the talk, you walk the walk, got it? Don't be all talk! So why do you discriminate against Ann Hui? Is it because I am a director... A woman director! Your industry and profession is another question. Right now, I'm asking who you are. I'll ask again. You are...? Maggie Cheung. Maggie Cheung is an actor, not a director. Yes, she is a woman though. That being said, I'm not opposed to Maggie Cheung being a director. You said profession is the next question. Make up your mind here! Who are you?! Ann Hui...! Takes four hours to answer a question! And you still insist you're not nuts?! What's your profession? I give up...! What is the meaning of this, Miss Hui? Ann Hui works as a director, of course! You think she sells rice noodle rolls?! Is this hospital of yours unlicensed or something? So many questions, but I haven't asked you this. Who might you be? Who? I am your psychiatrist, Miss Hui. You are suffering from a complex case of compound delusional disorder, as well as an acute case of complex dissociative identity disorder. I am here to help you untangle your complicated feelings. I also hope to help you return to the complexities of ordinary life. I'm grateful. - See, you appear quite normal now. - I'm extremely grateful. You can begin hypnosis now. This section of our treatment does not include hypnosis. My ancestral home is Liaoning... When I was 26 years old, I met a professor in London. He taught me the meaning of love... I am not hypnotising you. Do not act like I am. Furthermore, no one wants to know how you make love. You wanna evade such an important topic?! Evade?! I'm not evading! I only want to ask you again, you-- Ringo Lam. I want to ask you a different question. What I want to ask is your profession. I'm not asking who you are anymore! I might as well tell you that Mr Lam is a man. Decide what your gender is before you open your mouth! Then I'm Johnnie To. Now what...?! Don't you know? Ringo Lam and Johnnie To are the same person. Where the heck did Johnnie To come from?! - How can they be the same?! - They're the same! They are not the same person. - They are. - They're not! - They are! - They're not! - They're not. - They're not! Lock it in! They're not the same. Lock what in? - Lock in not the same! - Lock in they are. - It's locked! - I locked it! It's locked in, no backsies! Enough! What's your profession? I am Johnnie To. I am 15 years old this year. Johnnie To doesn't have a hand fetish though. In my hand is... an Austrian Glock 17, assembled in seven seconds. Now tell me just who the hell are you?! Geez... He's resorted to this move. Seems like Dr Cheung's exhausted his arsenal. Do you think this kind of treatment will actually prove worthwhile? LAWRENCE LAU He switched the roles of doctor and patient. If this does manage to cure him, it'll become very hard to discern between doctors and patients in our hospital. LAM SUET If it cures them, what difference does it make? Too bad we'll be at sixes and sevens. Doctors and patients all mixed up. We won't know who's sane and who's not. That's right...! If there's a fire and all the records are burnt, when they rebuild the hospital... Say they mess up and mistake a patient for a doctor, A sane person is treated insane. What a whoopsie daisy that'll be... That's right... This hospital was burnt down before. Dr Cheung was the one who stayed behind to rebuild, so a lot of the rules come from him. Dr Cheung wouldn't be a patient's delusion, right...?! Are you saying there's something wrong Dr Cheung's mind, then? Which Dr Cheung are you referring to? The one standing there acting all tough. I'm asking you now: who are you?! Fine! Since you're so persistent, I'll tell you. I am Ringo Lam. Pretending to be a doctor to trick me...? How can you prove you're him?! In the 1980s, I returned to Hong Kong from Canada. I don't care about anything. I only care about loyalty! How can men without loyalty still be brothers?! Brotherhood is-- Brother... You've got it wrong. This is John Woo! It's all the same... He's also another hard man. Oi, oi?! Don't touch-- Don't take my book! - Hey?! Give it back. Give my book back! - The book... The book... The book... Oh... So you're not a doctor! Ridiculous. I've had my doubts about you! - I'll unmask your true identity! - You... You don't know me. - Don't take my book! - I've forced out your true self. Gotcha. You are actually Tsui Hark. You're having way too much fun. - You have to drag him into this...? - So what? - You are, you are, you are... - I'm not, I'm not, I'm not... You are Tsui Hark! When you were eight years old, you already lost touch with reality. No one liked playing with you. The ones who did, didn't know how. You hid away, acting diligent, pretending to be cultured when actually... LITERATURE AND PHILOSOPHY you were secretly reading... wuxia novels. WUXIA NOVEL Answer me. What is your profession? Filmmaker! Whaddya think?! Filmmaker? What film are you making? Septet! Septet?! Are you making films or in a band? - Chinese music or western music? - Whaddya mean Chinese or western music?! I've got seven different directors, each making one story! Aren't you a band? Are you making MVs or films? - They're not the same. - How uninspired! We're shooting on film. Paying our respects to film. Film...? Film, what is that? Huh? Who's still using this... this film stuff? - No one prints it! Who'll print it? Huh? - Eat some cake...! I can't film trapped in here...! Let me out, I'll show ya! You're nuts, what if you're bitey like a mad dog on set? What are you on about?! Are you nuts or am I? Who's the doctor here?! I'm the doctor, of course! I'm in a lab coat, how could I not be one? Lab coat...?! One, two, three, awake! Hypnosis is over. - That concludes today's treatment! - What am I doing? Why am I here? - It's over! - Treatment...? Treatment for what? Quittin' time! Hey, the two patients in the next room reacted strongly to this new treatment. Observe their reactions. They're mild cases. They can be cured. Check today's CCTV footage. - Write me a report. - Understood, Director. Hmm... Those two inside, I wonder who's the normal one. Pfft...! We'll cure whoever's not normal. I guess so... It's not like we have anything else to do. Why not find something to pass the time, am I right? - Oh, we haven't been introduced. - Ann Hui. - Maggie. Maggie Cheung. - A pleasure... Let's exchange cards. - Who still has cards?! Let's scan...! - Okay, scan. Scan me. My QR code. This is mine. I'll scan you. - Here it is... - Yours isn't a QR code. Mine is. It says right here: 'QR code'. Here, take a look. What QR code looks like that...?! I'm on top, I'll scan you. - I don't like being on the bottom. - We'll find some help... Wow! This story sure is deep. What do you all think? Pretending to be all arty. You're obviously putting it on! Hey, aren't you Ann Hui?! Are you kidding me?! You booked us all here. Don't act like you don't know. They've gotten me all confused. Just in case, but are you Maggie Cheung? You're Maggie Cheung, Tsui Hark! SAM DOU DEOI YU A DEEP DIALOGUE
