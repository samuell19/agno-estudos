The first record that I ever bought, I believe, was Stampede, by the Doobie Brothers. The first record I bought was a 45 by David Bowie, was Space Oddity. The first record I ever bought, with my parents' money of course, was this 1973 Famous Monsters Speak. I think I bought my first record at age eight. It's the Monster Mash. The first record that I owned was a present, it was a Christmas present, and it was the Partridge Family Album. We Sold Our Soul for Rock and Roll, The double Black Sabbath album, my parents got it for me for Christmas, which is completely unlike my parents. They're not really churchgoing, but they consider themselves Christian. So, my aunt Marlene said, I will get you any record you want, for, I think it was Hanukkah, or something like that. Great. Please get me Blizzard of Ozz by Ozzy Osbourne. The first record I owned was given to me by my grandparents, they actually gave me two. Chuck Berry's Golden Hits, and the other was a Mozart Ein Kleine Nachtmusik. My grandma took me to buy my first record, and I picked out three records, I picked out The Cars, Blondie, and the one that really hit me the most, The Ramones, and it was in the third, I think it was Rocket to Russia. The Hotter Than Hell, probably asked mom for some money and went to Tumbleweed records in P-town. Me and my friend didn't have any money, but we had like, a dollar each, so we went in together, and bought Hotter Than Hell. I think the first record I ever owned, that I got my own, I think I shoplifted Summertime Blues by The Who. Who's Next, that was the first album I really remember buying on my own. Hey Jude, with Revolution on the back. The Beatles Blue and Red compilation records. With my own money, birthday money, I went to the record store and bought Led Zeppelin II, and Sergeant Pepper, same day. I rode my bike to the mall, and went to Corvette's, and I bought Led Zeppelin III. Believe it or not, it was a Seals and Crofts record, and I was like, you know, I was like, what the fuck is this? ♪ Darling, if you want me to be, closer to you ♪ Right, that's them, and I was like, this sucks, I fucking, they got my money! December's Children by the Stones. Had the dark cover, you know, it was just menacing. I bought a band called Think, it was called Once You Understand. A lot of these are one hit wonders, and the only way you knew about them was listening to these records on the radio. American Graffiti. The album that I came out, I think it came out in '75, and this is the actual album I bought. Looking at, nice! The record that I was like, I must have this record, is the soundtrack from Star Wars, definitely. My first record that I owned was actually a comedy record, it was George Carlin's AM and FM. First record I actually went out and bought, not sure, but it would've been a single. I remember, they were like, think they were 70 cents. And there was a music store near my house called Giant Music, and I think it would've been, I think it was the Lemon Pipers, Green Tambourine. My favorite song as a child, was Taxman. Off of Revolver, and it was a great package deal because Revolver was so powerful, A, to look at, the cover was insane, Taxman, first song on the record, and has the distorted guitar. It's just incredibly powerful, but I think it's a combination of the cover and that Taxman guitar solo, and it kind of, this is one of the first things that made me wanna play guitar. My favorite record as a child, as a young child, it probably would've been Endless Summer by the Beach Boys. It's like a double album, it was in my parents' collection, and... And you know, every single song is good. I think one of my favorite records as a child would have to be Jackson 5. Being grown up, you know, in that era, and just all around, I mean, I remember there was even a cartoon to the Jackson 5s, and it was, all, it was just, and as a kid, living in the hood and the ghettos, you know, and I just could relate all the way, you know. Best cartoon theme song ever, to this day, it's the punk rock lead guitar, is the Flintstones theme. Flintstones theme was so fast, and just so abnormal to hear a song like that on TV, you just wanted to run around the room. With the shows back then, you can't help but thinking, Gilligan's Island, 'cause that was one song that was gonna be on, immediately made you happy, you're just like, fuck school, I wanna watch Gilligan's Island. And the Flintstones for the theme. Probably the Banana Splits theme, or any song by the Monkeys. Free to be You and Me. Probably the earliest thing. Kind of just like, every American kid being raised by a... Early 70s liberals, I just knew, and I loved Free to Be, and I loved all the songs on Sesame Street. Jungle Boogie by Cool and the Gang. I saw them on Soul Train. I must've been 12, and I was like, holy, can I curse? Holy fucking shit... Definitely Roger K, with Leaders of the Pack, and I remember, the first record I bought, it was a compilation thing. Like, with all these other songs, and that was the only song I ever listened to. 'Cause it had the motorcycle in the end. And the revs and stuff like that, and I just loved that, even when I was a little kid, I loved the dramatic. My mother had decided we needed to learn to play the organ in our house, we had this electric organ, three keyboards and a pedal board, I actually got pretty good at it. But in the organ was a cassette tape player, and my sister, who was five years older than me, got a cassette tape with the song Tush by ZZ Top on it, and I played that song over and over and over and I was probably eight, maybe nine years old. And it was my very favorite song, in the entire world. I don't know why, I don't know what happened, but something about the electric organ and the cassette tape of Tush super muffled on this terrible speaker, was the best thing in my whole entire life. I loved the Electric Prunes, I Had Too Much To Dream Last Night, the Blues Magoos, and this was like stuff I'd never heard, it was something that really stuck in my ear and all that. Jesse Colin Young and the Yonugbloods get together. That song, when I was six, maybe younger, five, like, can you play that song again? I think it was the cover art. It was vaguely psychedelic, is my recollection and mysterious like Fantasia or something. It had that great guitar part and sort of Beatles-like harmonies. I had a real response to that. Puff the Magic Dragon, I think it was the Brothers Four. I vaguely remember the art work, I think it was four guys in cardigan sweaters on the cover with beautifully coiffed hair. Kind of stashed in with my mom's records, kind of deep into it so I probably wouldn't find it, was a record called 'Have a Marijuana' by David Peel and the Lower East Side. I discovered it when I was about eight or nine years old and I knew what pot was, I knew what marijuana was. On the record cover it had a giant marijuana leaf. You know it was probably around 1972 or something like that and the symbolism of the marijuana leaf, older kids that I knew had them on their jean jackets and shit. There was something really cool about that and iconic about that record cover. In kindergarten, we had them. The teacher would have us singing. She played piano and we would sing, we did Home on the Range and she taught us the harmony. It was as if my brain exploded and poured out of my ears when I heard the harmony. I couldn't stop thinking about the harmony of that song. That was a pretty important song for me. Without a doubt, Jim Croce's Bad, Bad, Leroy Brown. Now if you think, and I was probably eight years old at the time, I didn't realize what the soft spoken Mr. Croce was really kind of, the themes he was dealing with. Who was this bad, bad Leroy Brown? Apparently he was badder than King Kong and meaner than a junkyard dog. What I didn't quite realize was this was sort of a folk song about a Chicago drug lord. He's the El Chapo of 70s folk rock. My father despised rock music and he didn't allow it in the house. The only record that I could play as a kid was a Carpenter's record was Close to You. It's still one of my favorite records for the record cover and for the actual music. That's absolutely, just it is gorgeous. When you don't have a video and all you have is artwork, you really start digging into what's there and just staring at it while you're listening to the record. Visually it was a great sounding board, you'd just look at this, right, but musically this record is by far my favorite KISS record. Overall I'd have to say Mott from Mott the Hoople. I liked all the songs on it. Number one it was an album album, you know before album albums was just a hit song. The first song on side A and the first song on side B were the hits and then the rest was filler. But this was an album album. The first song that really got me going as a kid and that I kind of played over and over again and danced around to was probably Jumping Jack Flash by The Rolling Stones. I wish I could pick something more esoteric but that's what it was. Grew up in a group house, so we had a bunch of different record collections and at some point around when I was five or six they all lived in the living room with the stereo. So I used to take out the triple gate fold Tommy album, there was three copies of it in the house. I'd set up all three copies and build a little fort and then sit in there, dance around in it, try to analyze the record and figure out what everything meant in it and identified with it. So I'd say Tommy was my first record that I was really focused on and earliest remember being really into that one. It was probably a tie between Ironman and Crocodile Rock which was the seven inch that I remember having. But it was totally, we're talking like little kid logic so the connection being, I used to have reptiles and oh Crocodile Rock, that's my song. It's probably that or Iron Man because it was such a little mini epic. The one that sticks out in my head was Trini Lopez and for some reason I used to always sing that song Lemon Tree. That would be the one. The Hey Jude album by The Beatles. I just listened to this and stared at the cover of them on the back and on the front and listened to the record over and over and over again until I don't know if I wore it out. I probably couldn't hear the difference on that piece of crap I was listening to it on. But I really liked that. Whatever the song from The Grinch that Stole Christmas was. ♪ Wahoo Forest, wahoo Doris, wahoo Christmas, Christmas Day ♪ Whatever the one that was called. I forget. That was my favorite song as a child. I would sing it on May day, Earth day, my mother's birthday, everything. Go ahead, next question. My mom brought home a few Beatles albums. She brought home Help and Meet the Beatles and maybe one other. I really liked it but a spark wasn't ignited until my grandfather bought me the Woodstock soundtrack and I heard Jimi Hendrix on there. Now you have to understand, I'm maybe 10 or 11 years old and I'm listening to this and listening to the Hendrix on that, I'm seeing God on that. I'd never seen Jimi Hendrix. I didn't know what a Jimi Hendrix was or anything. I just saw his name on the record, Jimi Hendrix. From what I heard there, I thought he was maybe a 75 year old, gray haired man, sitting on a stool playing this music. I had no idea that he was who he was. But that was the 'Ah ha' moment. We went to visit a friend of my parents who lived in Lyland, way out, and he had a copy of Jimi Hendrix, Smash Hits. That's the first time I remember hearing Hendrix. I just kept listening to Hey Joe over and over and again. Cadet also just blew my mind. I couldn't understand what was happening. Of course The Beatles were so central at that time in my life, I loved The Beatles. The Beatles cartoon was on so we used to watch that. Also The Monkees cartoon or TV show was on. I was very interested in rock and roll early on. Hendrix was really, that was sort of scary. That was a different kind of music. Then Janis Joplin, who was also really significant. I have two older brothers and they were both into different kinds of music, but one love they shared was The Beatles and I have a distinct memory in my very early childhood of always hearing that first chord in A Hard Day's Night on the record player and it always grabbed my attention and then I'd start dancing around and then as soon as they allowed me to touch their Beatles records I started touching them and looking at them and smelling them and listening to them under their supervision so I wouldn't scratch them. It was that first chord in A Hard Day's Night for sure. I mean I don't have just one story, but just like you, my father is involved with my music foundation. He managed rock bands in the 60s and so the first band he put out would be 1966, so I was like eight or nine. I started going with him to shows and stuff. It's about the same time I saw The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, which I remember me and my brother sitting in front and watching that and going back in our room and acting it out. I think I was the drummer on an ottoman with some kind of pieces of wood or something and then we just pretended to play, like we were The Beatles or something! Fourth of July, 1977 and we were lighting off sparklers and I had never lit a sparkler before and so I decided that it would be interesting to see what it felt like if I touched the sparkly part, and so I touched it and burnt my finger. I remember just getting a piece of ice and putting it on my finger and going into my friend's house for the ice and on television was Yellow Submarine. I'd maybe heard of The Beatles, but the cartoon Yellow Submarine was on television and I had this piece of ice on my finger watching Yellow Submarine and it just being whoa. When I was growing up my parents bought us this horrible, huge plastic I guess jukebox, it looked like a jukebox but it was just a big piece of plastic that was empty and it had speakers and just a really bad little turn table and it sounded horrible, but they bought us that. I think at a yard sale, just grabbed a box of 45s. I remember this seven inch, which was The Beatles, Help and on the back side is I'm Down. My parents came home with the White album. It might not have been right when it came out. But I was maybe three or four years old and I think why that hit me was because everything about it. If you're a little kid and you're just kind of opening up and it's this white cover, it's a gate fold, it's a couple of records. There's a song on it that's not really music, like Revolution Nine and all of this and I just remember that's a big one for me and that's one of the first things that was like, "Whoa. What's going on? "What are these other records that they have in the house?" When I was four, five, six I thought liking music was girly, it was something girls did. I had this weird twisted, masculine sort of thing attached to it, it was so weird. But secretly, I remember melodies going through my head. Things I would hear on the radio, this was the early 60s. You know, these goofy pop songs. The first time that I just couldn't resist anymore was The Beatles. The Beatles, I mean, you couldn't have been around in '63, '64 and not have been impacted by The Beatles. When they were on Ed Sullivan, it was like the man landing on the moon, it was as big as the assassination of JFK in some ways. I mean it was monumental. Riding in my dad's car, '63 Buick if I remember, and back then it was just a regular AM station blasting. Ah, my dad's listening to music. I'm in the back with him, whatever. Hearing The Beatles Revolution come on, that guitar, I was like what the hell is that? Kind of shook me up. What the fuck is this? You know? I was like wow, man. Listen to that. And it just dropped, duh duh duh ♪ Do you want a revolution Back then, lyrics didn't really mean much to me, you know? It was just like the music just hit me like wow, this is amazing! When I was four or five years old I had a little transistor radio and I'd listen to the AM station, WMEX and they played the rock and roll of the day like The Stones and Beatles and all that. I started listening to these songs and I'd tell my parents later, "Hey, I heard this song on the radio can you get me the record, is that okay?" They started getting me records and I remember having Beatles stuff in the house, mostly singles and mostly 45s. I was a carsick kid and I was in the back of the station wagon. My brother and sister were in the seat behind mom and dad and I was in the very back, trying to keep from puking and the song A Horse with No Name came on the radio by America. In retrospect it's kind of a moment I can point to that sort of shaped me or I realized later it kind of steered me in the direction that I went in, to be a musician as a career or life as a musician. That song cured me from being carsick. That's kind of miraculous. My grandparents had this old radio and I used to listen to it, they played a lot of oldies. I guess they weren't that old at the time but they were still old enough. They were late 50s as opposed to like 60s, which it was. The song came on, La Bamba, and I thought, "Wow this is a really cool song." I just thought that riff was just amazing. I think when I was an infant the radio was on constantly. My dad's always playing his swing big band music. Songs that kind of stuck in my head from that time are probably Three Little Fishies, ever heard that song? Ever heard that song? Growing up in Boston, the radio station was called WRKO. It was an AM station. 68 RKO. They would play what we call one hit wonders. I head The Surfaris and that was the one song I just said, "This is cool as hell." I went out and walked about one and a half miles to the only record store in my town, right outside of Boston, to buy this record. It was like 75 cents brand new and it was Wipe Out, Surfaris on one side and Surfer Joe on the other. What I thought was really cool, was Wipe Out didn't have any vocals and Surfer Joe did. It was all about California. That actually drew interest in me to go to California. I found an AM radio in the garbage and it worked. Then I went and I bought a little head phone and it was like no matter what me and my two brothers were going through in a foster home, which it got closed down by the state. It was a pretty abusive place. But no matter what I was going through, every night when my brothers fell asleep, I would be under the blanket with that head phone in listening to all the music on AM radio which was soul music. Sly and the Family Stone and the emotion coming off that stuff... you know, Sam Cooke, just all the old school stuff really helped me get through a lot of that stuff I was dealing with. Music made all the pain of the other stuff subside for a little while. It was as much visual as it was auditory. Literally it was a matter of like going and buying comic books in the local record store slash head shop, I'm looking up at the walls and going, "Oh look at that Boston record! "Look at that Beatles record! "Look at that Stones record! "Look at that Zeppelin record!" How badass and cool are these images? Think about an eight year old mind looking at a Roger Dean, Yes cover going, "What the hell is that?!" My mind is expanding! There was a record store on the Cape that I would walk into and you'd see the shelves of vinyl up against the walls. Okay that looks cool, like even Meat Loaf. That first Meat Loaf record it was like, "Wow! Look at that record cover!" I bought the record, I was like this fucking sucks. But at the time, it wasn't like you could just take the records out and put them on and listen to them at the time. That wasn't a thing. They'd have them on maybe in the store and you'd hear something, but a lot of times back then you went by, gosh this cover is awesome. Maybe you could find Cream magazine or Circus, sort of get an idea of what a group might be like. My first real personal experience with music was from TV. I know it's embarrassing, but true. My first record that I asked my mother to buy for me was Bobby Sherman, not Sean Cassidy. Sean Cassidy's wings were a little too wingy. He was too soft for me, Bobby Sherman had a little more umph to him. There was a fold out and I hung it on my wall. I think I was seven years old. When I was a kid I lived on Targee Street in Staton Island across the street from the court house and we lived downstairs in the basement ground floor thing. The back was my father's tool shop or whatever, you know? The front was kind of like a play room kind of whatever. We had a stereo down there and all these eight tracks, tons of eight tracks. Bobby Sherman, Voltic, Partridge Family. But we had Goats Head Soup by Rolling Stones. I remember my brother playing and singing along to Star Fucker. As kids, I thought that was amazing. That and Simon and Garfunkel, I loved. I guess I was like three or four years old and I knew all the lyrics to Cecilia. I used to sing that all the time. As soon as it came on in the car, we were driving. You had a three year old kid singing about a girl cheating on ya. What made me start paying attention to music was what also made me not pay attention to music for a couple years, which was having to listen to my father play country music on his guitar along with his friends. Every night, all day long it seemed like. Everyday, 24/7 it seemed like. The same old junk from the 40s and 50s and I hated it. That was my first exposure to music and they play 50s songs. My mother loved Elvis and I could care less about any of it. Nothing drew me in at all until, like you mentioned, Led Zeppelin. When I was nine years old, Led Zeppelin Whole Lotta Love came out as a single and was being played everywhere and that part in the middle where the sound effects would come in and he started breathing heavy and he's like "ahh ahh ahh" Actually disturbed me to a degree, but attracted me also. Being disturbed, and a little bit today, and attractive I was drawn into that song. That was one of the first albums I ended up buying. You grew up in Los Angeles and there were long drives and back then you didn't really have a cassette player. You listened to the AM radio. There were a lot of AM radio, you know The Beach Boys, The Beatles, that kind of stuff. I distinctly remember Cat Stevens. This was like late 60s early 70s. My brother got a reel to reel player and the first recollection I have of listening to music or hearing it was West Side Story soundtrack and the song Gee Officer Krupke was my first recollection of any kind of music. My mom was a big music fan. My parents split up when I was young, but they both were record... not collectors but it was the 60s and everybody had Herb Albert and stuff like that. My mom, she was really into The 5th Dimension and so that was kind of the first song, Up Up and Away, that I really got into 'cause my mom would fucking play that song twice a day. When I was really little there was this record called Journey to the Center of the Earth by Rick Wakeman and that record like, I was super into it because it had a gate fold sleeve with a kind of like weird iguana that was dressed up in this crazy background to look like a giant dinosaur living in a cave in the center of the earth and it was narrated by Viv Stantial maybe, it was one of those important sounding British dudes who would tell the story. In between give the narration and between the Prague, people with swords or whatever. Well my dad was who he was and he loved and listened to and knew, inside and out, classical music. These are highly complex, if you've ever seen a music sheet for an orchestra for classical music, Brahms, Beethoven, Chopin, my dad loved Chopin, and Mozart and et cetera. He could whistle along to an entire symphony of Beethovin. He would hear a little snippet that guys like you or me would not, I mean it would sound nice. We would say that it was pretty. We might even know, I'm at the stage where I kind of know it's Mozart versus Beethovin. I kind of know those distinctions, but I don't know that's Mozzart's Suite in E minor or that's Beethovin's... okay Beethovin's Ninth is easy. But there are some that are difficult and my dad, instant. So I grew up with that permeating to me, so I think that had a lot to do with my sense of melody my sense of timing, building, layering, you know? All of that is incredibly complex stuff that you don't just pick up easily. I'm grateful to him for that, so that was sort of the planting of the seeds. When I was 10 to 12 months, I guess this doesn't really count as a memory 'cause it's before I remember it, but I always had lots of music around growing up and Aretha Franklin Respect, the background vocals of the ree-ree-ree part. I would stand up in my crib and yell, "Ree-ree-ree-ree" whenever I wanted to hear music. I guess that's my first identifying with music and sort of like, probably one of my first words too, as it being counted as a word. My memory is of being very young at my dad's apartment in Columbus, Ohio and my parents were divorced when I was pretty young. I lived in Cleveland. He lived in Columbus. I think he had ordered a K-tel Little Richard, just like off the television, Little Richard's Greatest Hits. I just remember literally dancing around in our tightey whiteys to Keep a Knocking or something. It makes me emotional to remember this. But, I mean, how are you not going to devote yourself to music after that. I discovered a lot of music through radio and so there's some certain DJs that were really important in my life. When they were on WHFS was a station based in Mathesda, Maryland that had a couple DJs that were really interesting, playing their own thing, and didn't have to play some corporate song list that... Late at night I could hear early blues from this guy Weasel and discovered so much about music through DJs and also discovered punk rock, it was a great show, and Mystic Eye, greatest show on the HFS. First place I heard Iggy Pop, you know? So much music I learned through DJs. Discovering FM radio and discovering on accident Left of the Dial college radio and hearing heavy stuff on college radio, that's what did it for me. It wasn't any people because I didn't really know anybody. It was just pretty much me, so I discovered it through FM. I would have to say my biggest influence in music that really got me into punk rock was my cousin Choochee. I remember, it's a funny interesting story because Choochee was supposed to not be with us today, he still is! He had this disease where he lost one kidney. He was gonna lose his second, he was apparently supposed to die, but he never did. The crazy story about that is his mom, because we were young, we were all young. We were all like 15, 16 years old. You're son's gonna die. What are you gonna do? Give him anything he wants! So he had a big Marshall amplifier, this punk rock band called Barb Wired Babies. He was just punked out, he's doomed so he's gonna go all out. I'd go into his room and he'd be blasting The Sex Pistols and I was like, "What the hell is this?" Then we're doing mescaline and all crazy out of my minds. My father's taste was horrible. Mom's taste was white trash country. But my cousin's just, were two years older than me, and there was four of them, they were twins that were two years older than me. I was like 11 and they were 13 and Keith was 15 and Ricky was 17. They said, "Let's take him to a concert! "Let's take the little kid to the concert." I was like, "Okay, I want to go." My parents go, "What show are you taking him to?" "Oh, it's gonna be at the Boston Garden. "It's gonna be fine. This band is doing a whole opera." I'm going to an opera? "Yeah, it's called Quadrophenia. It's like an opera." Cousins, it was my cousins Rhonda and Carrie. We looked up to them, they were four, five, six years older than I am and their basement was The Monkees, The Beatles, and KISS. I do remember Jim Croce as well, but those were the main records we would listen to. My cousin Jimmy, who lived around the corner from me for a few years, he was a big music fan. He was mostly into blues and bluesy rock and roll. I had just heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time, so this is my maybe 14 years old and I went over to see Jimmy and said, "Hey, you got any Jimi Hendrix records?" He loaned me his copy of Smash Hits. He was very generous loaning me his records. I still got a few in the pile down there, which I'm gonna return to him one of these days. I would say it would be my older cousin, Johnny, who was just cool and he's probably like 10 years older than me. I would hang out with him and he'd let me clean out his weed and we'd go to the unemployment office together. I was just his little side kick. He was very into the Yankees, that's not music, but he was into Bruce Springsteen and Lynyrd Skynyrd and Molly Hatchet. My brother, who's two years older than I am, was kind of into drugs and you know, he tried to get me to listen to the Grateful Dead. I remember at the UCLA, what was it called? The Pavilian, or the UCLA something, I don't know what it was. Grateful Dead I was like, no way. I'm not going to The Grateful Dead. This is where I kind of already knew about punk, like I already knew. I was listening to Rodney on the Rock. I'm like, "You want to see The Grateful Dead, why?" He's like, "You know you can take acid and it's really awesome." I was like, "No, I don't want to do that. "I don't want to do that." In a way, he was my inspiration that made me even more into punk, because it was like that is so not what I'm into right now. I have a huge answer to that and I've actually credited it on record covers to my older brother Bob. I've said, "It's your fault! "You got me into this whole mess." Being in the music business, he really pushed Hendrix on me, like you said your dad did and The Allman Brothers, Brothers and Sisters. He's like, "You gotta hear this Jessica! "The guitar playing is amazing on here." Then Cream, and I'm still into Clapton big time. Both of my older brother's because they had such different musical tastes were huge influences. One brother was listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Allman Brothers and the other brother was listening to Dylan and Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell and later on Patti Smith and lots of stuff. But a neighborhood friend of my brother's, an older kid, named Eddie Rose in the late 70s came over to the house with Clash and Ramones records, the first ones. That was, you know, legend. My older brother and my sister, I was the youngest. They definitely influenced me, my brother because he had the early Slade records. They were popular on Staten Island in the 70s. Slade was with like the poor kids, whatever. The white trash kids, he had that and-you outta here? Okay. He had that and Mott the Hoople. He had Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper. My sister was more into the pop side. She was into The Baycity Rollers and stuff like that. But then Kiss came into the picture. I really don't know. My sister brought me to The Clash and then The Clash opened up my eyes to a whole nother world of underground music and I think there were movies. Stop Making Sense came out and that was The Taking Heads and then there was all these little avenues and then I heard Gang of Four and I don't know, I ended up at some show in college. I walked through the kitchen, in these back hallways, and ended up in this room and I was watching Gang of Four. They were performing at Carnegie Melon and I fucking lost my shit right there! I was like I love this band! Oh my god! Probably my father, who was a swing jazz guy, but he was hard core and he listened to records constantly. He was just a really avid, close, critical musical thinker. Plus, it was a tremendous gift he gave to me, he used to take me into New York to the jazz clubs to see people that he admired. That was a tremendous gift to me. My father was a television producer and record companies would give promo copies to the TV station for whatever. He was on the local CBS affiliate, he did nighttime news. They had all this other stuff, and so they would send him all these records. He'd bring records home, so it was like having Spotify in 1975 and so my influence was kind of DIY on it, but there's always this rack of new stuff coming. Toto, oh that's bad. Like bad good! Toto's cool, it's got guitar. Cody Alexander, he had six other brothers. He's the youngest and they're all just these long haired dudes that were really into rock and roll. His older brother, Roy Alexander, I used to go into his room when Cody wasn't around and I'd get stoned with Roy and his buddies, like Boyd and Daryl and stuff like that, or Dilbert. We'd listen to Steely Dan. He had Endless Summer by The Beach Boys. All the stuff that I wouldn't have heard normally. I will give a shout out to a guy who lived two doors down, a guy named Joe McGrath. I was probably eight or nine, Joe was probably the ripe old age of 12 or 13. He saw something in me and literally, we would hang out, I think Joe smoked the pot as well but that never came into our conversations. He would turn me onto the first three Aerosmith records, the first two Alice Cooper records, Black Sabbath. For me and my friends, it was a guy named Matt Fields, who still is a dear friend of mine. I remember I met Matt at a JCC dance and he was wearing a trench coat and a Joy Division pin and had like six rat tails and we immediately met and became best friends. It was through him that we all started listening to XTC, the entire first wave of 4AD bands, Parooboo. Damon Locks, who's still one of my best friends in the world, and Derek Bish who was his friend who I'm still friends with and Chris O'Conner. These were just three kids, that we were all in this art magnet together. I was doing these faux HR airbrush paintings and stuff and I think they kind of rescued me and they started making me tapes of DC punk rock and just like whatever it was. When we got to high school there was this transfer kid from California named Richard Bash. He's the one that brought us to our first show. He's the one that said, "Oh! Black Flag is playing." Oh yeah, we like Black Flag. He's like, "Well, we're all gonna go." Around that time we're just buying up all the records that we can based on what he's sort of letting us know. He's like, "Oh you should check out Minor Threat." They're from here, so my friend Dave went out and bought the record and it was like, we thought it was illegal. It was just like ♪ Fuck yeah, fucking shit The amount of cursing that was going on, we're like I don't know if we're allowed to listen to that, but I really like it! My best friend Mark Haggardy, who I was in bands with later, me and him sort of discovered rock music at the same time and started really getting into it. A lot of it was just us feeding off of each other. Going to record stores together, watching all the TV show specials with bands from the 60s and taking notes on them and later when we get into punk rock, going through photo magazines and trying to pick bands off of people's jackets. I wonder what that is! 999! That looks cool, let's check out that record! If he's got it on his jacket, maybe it's worth listening to. My best friend, Eric Neil, he had an older brother who was friends with The Feelies, who were kind of a popular indie band at that time. But Fritz Neil was his name, the older brother, and Fritz turned us both onto The Clash, I remember Plastic Bertrand, obviously the early Ramones, and all these things. Fritz Neil probably has no idea, he probably doesn't remember any of that, but he would put all this stuff in you know, "Try this, try this, try this." I was like a junkie. I needed more and more and more. So I'm working at this restaurant and these two cooks were just blasting 77 punk. They were blasting Plasmatics, The Ramones and telling the stories about them going to the Rath Underground Paradise, places that I was too young to go to and I'd heard a lot about. From '78 to '80 I was locked up and I went into the navy. Then I was stationed in Northfolk and there was this dude down there, I think his name was Dave or Dan. He was a mod dude. He was into the jam, but he was British. He knew all the fucking punk shit from, this was 1980. He knew all the punk shit from London and turned me onto this Live at the Vortex. I started really getting into a lot more of The Clash and The Damned and obviously The Pistols, but I heard them in the 70s. He had a real great sense of what music was going on. Henry Rawlins, we started hanging out. I remember going to his house. He had a BB gun. We'd go into his basement. He had a piece of foam against a wall and a cigar box he put poker chips in slots and we'd just sit there and shoot the poker chips. He had a Crosman 760 Pump Action Rifle and a little Co2 Pistol and I remember listening to Cheech and Chong, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin. That's where I first heard Nugent, was in his basement. Henry Rawlins, he is absolutely the most influential music taste maker of my early interest in punk music and then other music, and still is. I still listen to his radio show and always hear something that is interesting even if I don't like it. I was actually the one that turned most of my friends onto certain bands. I would be out there buying anything that looked interesting at yard sales or something. I had a collection of probably 2500 albums at one point. I discovered music cheaply until I learned how to shoplift well. ♪ Why am I going insane ♪ Why am I the one to pay What records made me who I today? Which is an interesting question because I mean I'm sitting here decades later, still probably over involved with music, never looked back. To me, the most influential record as a person was SS Decontrol's The Kids Will Have Their Say. If there was ever sort of a scene maker band for Boston hardcore, DIY independent action fought involvement, that was SS Decontrol. First Generation X record, and this record I listened to more than anything else in the 80s, pretty much until this came along which I probably listened to even more. Between these two, both in G, those would be my formative sort of 80s punk rock records. This one. This record as a musician is like... I love this record it's like flawless. It's hilarious. It's powerful. It's snotty. It's intelligent. Yeah, I like this one. Outcasts, Self Conscious Over You. First album. Bell faced die on a dare. This album's beautiful. It's just so innocent, really. They could barely play their instruments and the timing's off and they're singing love songs and stuff like that about being a teenager while bombs are going off in the streets outside. This album without a doubt meant a lot to me growing up and even to this day. I mean I don't even have to think about that. The Bad Brains first album 'cause I was living in the studio with them at 171 when they recorded it. So seeing what they were living through. For me, it's not just I put the record on. Every song has a story to it. I was there when HR was recording it. The guys were talking about it. We were living it, I was living it with them when that record was being made. To this day there ain't a fucking band on the planet that could touch those guys musically or lyrically or anything. Having been there when the late great Jay Dublee, God rest his soul, recorded it. It's like nobody made The Bad Brains sound that way on any record to this day. Obviously The Bad Brains are a huge influence for my band. A lot of British punk, Jam 69, The Damned. All those records. Over and over again. You know, Iggy Pop, Stranglers, The Sonics. It's so crazy now, you hear them on TV commercials, but when we first started getting into them, no one heard them. Those are the garage punk bands and the punk bands that got us into music. Hearing the first Blag Flag single, whew man. Nervous Breakdown record was massive for me. Sham 69, Tell Us the Truth. The live side of that. I thought, wow that's what I wanted. For me, the idea of being in a room with people singing along? That's all I've ever wanted. What blew my mind was probably Iggy Pop and The Ramones because everything is sped up and louder. What really made me want to play fast aggressive punk is, I would say, Greg Ginn from this record. I would listen to this, someone's picking me up to go to college and I'm blasting this in my bedroom and I miss my ride. I was in a head shop in downtown Lim when I was about 16, this would be 1976, and they had a crate of records on the floor. I'm looking through it and all of a sudden I see this record with this freaky looking guy on the cover. It's like wow, what's this? I turn it around and it says Iggy and The Stooges, Raw Power. Had the clerk play me a couple of songs, like wow this is great and I took it home. It didn't leave my turn table for a long time. That was a life changer. I was listening to something called punk rock before I knew such a thing existed. I think that certainly the first Clash record blew my mind and the second as well. Their early stuff was, the first two, three Ramones records also, the energy and the sheer dedication they played with. One, two, three, four! You know? Just you know, when you're a kid that touches you. That grabs your heart and makes it race. At this point, it sounds cliche, but it is 100 percent true. There's nothing that comes anywhere near this record was The Ramones, Rocket to Russia. I was listening to our college radio station at the time. I was 17, I'd heard about punk rock. I was drawn to the 60s counter culture thing. Not the hippie shit, but the counter culture. I was too late for that and I was looking for something out there, didn't know what it was. I could rebel with, not rebel thinking back then, wishing I was alive back then. Something relevant that meant something today. The DJ was saying I have to play a song from this band here. This is something called by The Ramones called Teenage Lobotomy. When that started playing, I'd never heard anything like that either. I just cranked it up to 10 and I was like yeah, this is fucking exactly what I like. There was this record store in Dupont Circle called Bread and Roses. We used to be regulars there and we walked in and this guy John was playing, it had just come out, it was The Ramones, Road to Ruin album. We were like, what the hell is this? He's like, "It's The Ramones. It's their brand new record. "I just got an advanced copy." We were like, "But what kind of music is this?!" We don't really understand what we're hearing. He said it was basically punk rock. From our perspective, we had always, you know, the media line of punk rock is it's an exclusively British form of music that people beat each other up to. That's kind of all anybody would tell you. It sounded stupid. Yeah, we were immediately sold on it. If I had to give credit to a single record if I ever have to, I think Never Mind the Bollocks by The Sex Pistols is just mind blowing. I think that just shook the world. That just changed music. It changed everything. It pretty much set and opened all doors in me and my life and so much more to walk through. There was other great bands doing stuff. The Ramones, I can't take that away from them, Dead boys. A lot of good stuff, but there was nothing as intense as Never Mind the Bollocks, just intense. Tom Snyder had a show on that was like every first Saturday night of the month. Instead of Saturday Night Live, he had his little news show. I remember they did a thing on the new thing in England called punk rock and Barbie Benton, they were interviewing her on the street. She goes, "Oh my god! "There's this band called The Sex Pistols." That name stuck out and the next time I was up at the record store, there it was. It must have just come out. I bought that and that was it for me. The record that changed the direction was The Teen Idles. In DC of course, punk rock was sort of recent when I was wandering around Georgetown looking for something fun to do and I'd hear that people hung around in Georgetown and looked for fun things to do. I was wandering the streets and I went into a record store and they said, "oh you should listen to this record." So of course, I bought the record immediately. It is the first record on Discord Records, which I subsequently worked for for 22 years. Apparently I really liked this music. This record, 9353, extremely important band for me and my friends. Growing up in DC in the 80s and a band that is sort of lost to the sands of time. I discovered Dead Kennedys and AC/DC at the same time. I remember asking my guitar teacher, the first song I learned to play was Back in Black. I remember asking him to teach me California Uber Alles and he was not into it. He goes, "I don't want to teach you "any songs by this band The Dead Kennedys. "That name is just really offensive to me." Which made it all the more interesting. Beatles, Beatles, Beatles, Beatles. As a kid and then when I started to become very interested in guitar as I got older, AC/DC, KISS, AC/DC, KISS. But if I'm gonna have to puck one, probably AC/DC. Malcolm, more than Angus. Get Your Ya-Ya's Out by The Rolling Stones. That was in my dad's collection. That's the first record I obsessed over. It was probably around '72 or '73. I was like nine years old I think. I listened to that record constantly. I used to take wax paper and trace the pictures on the back of Keith and Mick. Just kind of wonder who was playing what instrument. I knew all the between song banter so that record was huge. Paranoid and then I went back and got the first Black Sabbath record. Electric Funeral, that really changed my life. It was more dark stuff, then later on pushing ahead it would be the Killing Joke. The first Killing Joke record is still a huge influence on me. Blood sport, the stance, punk rock. Then seeing them live, it was just so pummeling. It still had heavy guitar, but it was punk and new wave and dance music. Completely different than anything else. Just like Paranoid, I thought was, I just was blown away by that first Killing Joke record. One big turning point for me was when you're getting an album for Christmas, two copies of the big hit album that year, Rod Stewart, A Night on the Town. I took one to Payless Drugstore to exchange it. I was riffling through all the records and this Led Zeppelin four album cover, the man with the bundle of sticks on his back. I saw that and I go, this is incredibly cool. I don't remember whether I bought it because of the album cover or because I might have recognized it and remembered Stairway to Heaven, I don't remember honestly. I was very young. I took it home and put the album on. Everything in my world changed. In terms of impact, life changing, planet wobbling off its access kind of impact, Hendrix. There's nothing even close, really there's nothing close. I mean he was the God head. When I heard that first album, all bets were off. Anything was possible. It was a world of wild imagination and color and limitless possibilities. That guitar, I'm getting goosebumps just thinking of it. The same record that originally blew my mind when I was 10 or 11 years old that made me want to change my religion to Jimi Hendrix was the Live at Woodstock album. Him playing, it sent me on a path of wanting to play rock, of wanting to play rock and roll, to play at an extremely loud volume, to be extremely distorted. That feedback was a note and a chord and a song. Jimi Hendrix. It all comes back to him. A house is on fire, what three records would you grab? Is that a desert island dissoff? First, if you're on a desert island, there's no electricity. Your batteries are gonna run out pretty soon, so I don't think any records are gonna help you. But if your house is on fire, you grab Minor Threat, Out of Step test pressing, only because number one it's a great record and number two it's extremely rare and will allow you to buy records to replace the one you lost in the fire. If my house was on fire and I had to get three records out, the first thing I would definitely get is... I have a Minor Threat test pressing of Out of Step. It's worth enough to probably fix some of the smoke and water damage, so I would need that in order to get sorted out because you know insurance, they could do anything and just say no. So I'd get that, and it's a good record. I would definitely take Exile on Main Street, by far my favorite Stones record, just such an important thing and I would take the Black album by The Damned. Probably the Minor Threat discography and let's face it, except for Good Guys Don't Wear White, they didn't have a bad song. I'd just get the fuck out of the house. If my house were on fire and I could only grab three records, I would grab The Faith, The Damned, and Love and Rockets. If my house were on fire, I would grab one of my favorite records. I did punk rock, which is what threw off my entire college career in the end, but I went to college for opera and Maria Callas was my actual favorite singer of all time. MC5 which is one of my favorite records of all time, oh my goodness. Reptile House, which is also a Discord record. If my house is on fire, which is not even a funny question because I've already been through this. I've unfortunately been through a fire and lost records, lost a dog, which is more heartbreaking than anything. I was actually playing a show with The Bruisers and I got that call and was like "Oh." Anyway, if I had to get out of my house with three records, you're making it really tough on me, I would definitely grab my Bad Brains, Pay to Cum. This has got to come with me everywhere I go. I love all of these. I would grab SS Decontrol, Kids Will Have Their Say. This is one of my all time favorite albums. All time, love it. Everything up here I love. I don't think I would need to grab my own because it's in my mind, but if I had to take another choice, I love the Misfits of course, Minor Threat. Can I take four? Can I take The Misfits and Minor Threat? I'll take these two. Bullet and In my Eyes, Minor Threat, I'd be very tempted to grab a couple test pressings like Flex Your Head test pressing or the Iron Cross test pressing, just because I wouldn't be able to replace those. The Bad Brains single I like because it's the only signed record I have and it's also one of the early ones. They didn't figure out how to fold the cover correctly so it's like too fat and long which I kind of like. I don't know, I'd probably grab something like that. My Bad Brains, seven inch, which I could easily put that in this category because it completely changed everything I knew about music and it sounded pro. It didn't sound like a local band. It was just amazing and I hadn't heard that much. There wasn't really any hardcore to hear at that point. So this record, I'd grab it, and it's also probably my only valuable record left. Raw Cassette, Catch a Fire, and man I've got to go with fucking Master of Puppets. I fucking love that record dude. You know why? When Master of Puppets came out I was addicted to cocaine and freebase at the time and going through a lot of crazy shit. When I put that record on I was like, to wake up and have your breakfast on a mirror, it was a lot of deep shit being said there and the music was just fucking brutal and it's Cliff Burton's last record with them. It was just like, you know, I was like holy shit. 3, 2, 1, I would grab the Bad Brains wire sessions which I have on cassette, but I don't have it with me. But I would grab this one, and number two would be this. But my number one record, if I just had to grab one, would be this one. Okay, so if my house was on fire what would I do? Do I want this? It's cool. This is a great record. I mean, a classic for sure. Well if my house is on fire, I have this one box of all my collectable, or records that some people refer to as bonzers. I heard that somewhere basically refer to rare or prized records so I guess that's kind of the term I go with, but I'd just grab the box. If I had to specifically pick three, one would be the first Articles of Faith album, What We Want is Free. Another one is Negative Approaches first seven inch, in fact their only seven inch I guess. This last one isn't really anything that rare, I suppose. It's a band from Michigan called The State. I had a friend named Jane from here and she went to the University of Michigan and would send me back flyers and records and this is one of the ones she sent me. "You gotta check this band out, they're great!" I did that and it has really strong sentimental value because she died on 9/11. She was on one of the planes, so I really cherish any of the records I got from her after she passed away I basically inherited her record collection as well. That's something that means a great deal to me. It's an impossible answer. Honestly? I think, like I mentioned before, why I keep these things in boxes is so I can throw them at the window, so I don't have to pick threw them. I could just throw them out and I'll be great. I don't know, this The Saints third album, Prehistoric Sounds. Slade, Play it Loud. I only get three. This record, the Why EP. Discharge. Jesus. It's like I got this when it first came out. This fucking record scared the shit out of everybody. Let's see, Rocket to Russia and then probably, I get three? Two of the three signed by Edward Gory albums that we have. One False Move by The Freeze, Edward Gory the artist signed them and because I love Edward Gory and I miss him I'd grab those. That's funny that you asked that. My answer is I'd grab my negatives. I wouldn't grab records. I'd probably just grab a few Rolling Stones records. I would probably give a different answer to this every hour of every day, so if I had to answer it right now, let's go with The Clash, London Calling; The Beatles, it's like I want to say the White album, but believe it or not I'm gonna say Magical Mystery Tour; It's a tie right now in my brain between Let it Bleed by the Stones and Blue by Joni Mitchell. If my house was on fire I would grab the White album. I would grab, I might grab Honky Dory - no I would grab Low. For sure. I would definitely grab Street Hustle. All right, I gave it some thought and every time I thought about it I changed my mind. But this morning, Electric Ladyland. My second choice this morning would be Trout Mask and the last one, it could have been their third album, you know I love their third album as well, I love even some of those later things that are sort of compilations of live stuff recorded at Max's but this record is very important to me. I actually met Lou a few years ago he signed it. Then I was bummed that I had him sign it on the front. This front is just so brilliant. Have to be an Allman Brothers record. This was one of my first favorite bands. When I was 14 I took a bus and went down to Georgia and saw them at Lana Jam so it would have to be an Allman Brother's record, probably either Eat a Peach or Live at Fillmore. East, John Coltrain Ballads, and then Will the Circle be Unbroken by The Nitty Gritty Band. To be honest, the first thing I would grab would be my 1952 Gibson ES175. The last record that I bought was Drinks, which is a project band with Tim Pressley from White Fence and Kate Lebon who's a Welsh singer. I think it's called The Essential Charlie Rich. The last record I purchased was by an artist by the name of Eluvium and the record's called Nightmare Ending. Honestly the last record I bought was probably Duran, Duran and it was for my wife because we got a new turn table. I got this Moondog record a few weeks ago. I love Moondog. The last record I purchased was Radkey's Dark Black Makeup. The last record that I bought would be, I forget the title of it, it's a Delbert McCLinton record. Yeah. That would be the last one. The last record I bought was Key Markets by Sleaford Mods. Animals, box set. I wanted the Animals box set. The last record I purchased, and I've been doing this as a habit from the very beginning that our first album came out, Victim in Pink, it's just for the purpose of good luck itself, I always go out and but my record. I go to the record store and I buy my record. It hasn't worked. Christ, I don't know. I've been illegally downloading for so long now I don't know. I can't remember the last one. Probably Leatherface, Stormy Petrol. Battle Ruins. It's a bunch of local guys. They're like a side project. If I tell you, then people will think I'm just a hippie and I'm not even into hardcore and I'm just a fraud, but you know, but Apostrophe by Frank Zappa was something that I picked up. I'm spoiled by the internet because I look for stuff that I didn't buy that's not in my collection of records and CDs and I just stream it and I don't download it and it's kind of a shame. The music industry is like that. This is the last record I purchased. It's a band from New York City called Nandas. I found out about it just on the internet, you know, checking them out online and it was really good so I got this a couple weeks ago and I was not disappointed. The last record I bought was last week for a road trip. I got Singles Going Steady by the Buzzcocks. The stereo situation hasn't been around for decades. It's just too easy with the digital stuff. I listen in the car and I listen on that little speaker there. It's sort of pathetic, isn't it? That little Bose, whatever it's called. The last single record I got was a reissue of a DC band called The Hangmen, 60s garage band who was sort of hard to hear this band in the 80s and 90s, but now being rediscovered. I got 'Bout Love by Clydie King. It's a northern soul, all these old. All the Time, by The Intruders. Both of these I got for maybe 20 bucks with postage. The last record I purchased was Black Sabbath's first album because it's the deluxe version. It's a double album with outtakes and this album is ground zero for a lot of people and I can see why. Let's go with KISS, Dressed to Kill. It sucks that I don't have time to listen to vinyl. Almost never can I make time to do it, so I totally turned into one of the file people. I just pluck music out of the ether. I think it was the first Undertones record. I just, you know one thing I just recently bought? I'm not sure this was the last record, but Eddie Harris live. You know Eddie Harris? The jazz guy? Had a listen here track, good jam. Him live at The Village Gate, I think. That's a great record. I bought Funky People Part One, James Brown. That was the last record I bought. Record labels sell plastic. That's what they're selling. And the reason we buy one piece of plastic over another one, is because they have licensed information to be inscribed into that plastic that is more attractive to us than say some other information that the guys licensed for another piece of plastic. Ultimately, records label, it's just fucking plastic and with paper on it right? That's what a record is. What do you call a record you don't listen to? A piece of fucking trash.
