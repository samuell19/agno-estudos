(Man) Come in. Leave it open. Have a seat, Carl. D'you like cigars, Carl? Cuban. Well, thank you, Warden. Keep the whole box. lt's a gift. They're darned hard to come by. Thank you again, Warden. That's darned nice of you. You deserve it. You pulled five of your ten years, out on good behaviour. - Free at last. - Yes, sir. You know, Carl, l'm darned sorry to see you go. l can't say that about most of the inmates but l trust you. You made things run real smooth. Shorty'll run things just fine. l trained him myself. l'm sure he will if you say so, Carl. - But not as good as you. - Well, thank you, sir. No reason to thank me, Carl. You deserve it. When you first got here, you were as worthless a punk as l've ever seen and l've seen some worthless punks in this place. But you were different. l sensed it right away. And l always trust my instincts, Carl. l'm never wrong. No, sir. Take that as a lesson. Trust your instincts and you'll never go wrong. l think l will, sir. So, what are your plans? Me and my best friend were thinking about going into the laundry business. - That's what l know best. - You do know the laundry business. - Best foreman l ever had. - Thank you, Warden. Laundry's a good business, Carl, a stable business. Like food and funeral homes. People will always want clean clothes. When l changed this facility over from licence plates to laundry, they thought l was crazy. But l showed 'em. l made it pay. For everybody. So, laundry, huh? You have been paying attention. l'm glad to see my instincts proved true. Use the knowledge you've gained here and you'll be OK. - l think l will, too, sir. - Good for you. Well, the best of luck, Carl. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Warden. - And thank you. - Close the door on the way out. So, Matushka... you finally made it out, huh? What's it to you? You think you're a tough guy. But l heard you in there with the warden. You're just a brown-nosed ass-kisser. You've been kissing his ass since you got here. l got news for you, shit-for-brains. He runs the place. l'll tell you something, Matushka. l never liked you. l always thought you were up to something. Gee, l'm sorry to hear that. l always thought so much of you. Funny man. You'll be back. You got that backwards. See, tomorrow you'll still be here. l won't. - Carl, my man! - Keep the faith, brothers. l'll look out for your wives and let them know you miss 'em. - Fuck you! - Not any more. This is Carl Matushka. He's out of here. But he'll be back. Carl! (Laughs) Freeze! Hey! That's a Redford-Dondero game ball, man! Come on. (Barks) Whaa! Hey, Patrick, my main man. - Carl Matushka. - That's me, man. Well, you look...like shit. - You, too. What's with the hair? - lt's new. You like it? - You look like a faggot. - Thank you. And fuck you. l can't believe it's you, man! l didn't think l'd see you again. - Why not? - You got five years and l walked. Well, that's how it goes, right? l get caught. You don't. Yeah, but you kept your mouth shut. l owe you big for that. We were best friends once. Maybe l'll let you be my friend again. Fat boy! Come on. Dynamic duo. We're un-fucking-stoppable. Remember football, basketball? Water sports? Un-fucking-stoppable! Damn right. Everything all set? Hey, paisan, trust me here. Oh, Tom backed out so l had to get another driver. Tom was all set. What happened? He didn't tell me. He just calls and craps out. l said ''Fuck it, l'll get somebody else.'' - He's cool? - He's cool. - OK. - Everything's OK now you're back. l feel excited. Yee-hah! l haven't been this high in years. Well, calm down. What about the rest? - ln the back. - OK. Bon app√©tit. We got 23 minutes. Let's get going. - Hi. - Hi. - What's your name? - Randi. OK, Randi. Listen, l don't have a whole lot of time, so... You got about an hour as far as l'm concerned. Starting from ten minutes ago. l don't think l'm gonna need anywhere near that much time. Do l know you? Uh...not yet. lt's...it's been a long time. Here, baby, let me help you. - (Giggles) - What? - You'll smudge my lipstick. - Jesus! Party favours. Shit! There you are. That's a big boy. Oh, shit! Ooh! Ooh! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! God! Mm. Mm. - Jesus. - (Giggles) Oh, you're religious. That's nice. Janie Kochanski? l'm Carl Matushka. - Oh, my God. - Jesus! - Carl! - (Patrick laughs) Oh. Uh...well, how have you been? - Oh, great. And you? - Oh, just great. l've just got out of prison after five years. See what l've been doing for a living. Yeah. l'm working outcall. You never gave me back my letter jacket. - No. l didn't. - Hah. l know that we didn't go out for very long but l sure have fond memories of you. Yeah? As the girl who stole your letter jacket? Yeah, among other things. l really had a thing for you and you dumped me really hard. l did? - You don't even remember. - Hey, l recognised you. But you don't remember what happened, right? - No. - Figures. You were the most conceited prick in school. And the best looking. That too. You haven't changed. Oh, yes, l have. Five years in the joint'll take something out of you. But not all of it. Janie, you still look good. Really good. Yeah, well, thanks. lt's all l got, what's left. - What've you been up to? - Oh, you know. - This, that, a life. - Uh-huh. lt's a sad story that no one wants to hear. l'll listen to your sad story if you'll listen to mine. - Yeah? - Yeah. (Laughs) Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. l'm not trying to fool anybody, Janie. Honestly. Give me that card back. Why? Here's my home address and phone number. Stop by and see me sometime. You mean professionally or unprofessionally? Huh. Which would you prefer? - Unprofessionally. - That doesn't mean for free. - That's not what l'm talking about! - Hey, me either. OK. But, you know, only if you want to, that is. Yeah, l do. We'll go out. - Really? - Yeah, really. - You're not just saying it? - No, l mean it. OK. - l hope you're amused, Patrick. - l am. l love reunions. - You can drop me off over there. - You got it. lt was, um.... (Laughs) - ..good to see you again, Carl. - Yeah. You, too, Janie. Real good. - l'll call you. - Do. So, what are you guys up to? What? Oh, uh, nothing. Sounds like you're about to pull a job. No shit? - Be careful, OK? - Yeah. - Well... - And call me. - Yeah, l will. - OK. - Bye. - l'll see you. (Coughs) Look at the time. l hate to interrupt but we're in a bit of a hurry. Holy... Son of a bitch, you knew that was Janie Kochanski! - That was Janie Kochanski? - Oh, fuck you! (Laughs) - lt was good to see her, though? - Yeah, man, real good. - Let's rock this show! - All right. We got 15 minutes. lt's been a long time, man. Yeah, well, you know, five years. - We were something way back when. - Yeah, we were. We're gonna be again, l'm telling you. Man, it is so weird being out. Everything is just so fucking huge! Tell you what, Patrick. l'm never going back. You remember the Brother Rice game when me and you scored 40 points? They ain't seen nothing like us. And they never will again. That's Donny, a friend of mine. He's really smart. - He's like a genius. - He looks like shit. ls he a junkie? Yeah, kind of. But he's got it under control. lt's cool. - How fucking smart can a junkie be? - You'd be surprised. You'll see. Hey, you guys, how's it going? Donny, Carl. This is Donny. (Grunts) You don't suppose we could stop somewhere for a second, huh? What? You gotta take a leak? No, l gotta make a stop. - What for? - None of your fucking business! lt'll just take a second, all right? Yeah, we're not really doing anything today, so why not? Fuck no. - Shit. - (Carl) You gonna be all right? Yeah, fine. Life's a fucking cabaret. Don't worry about me. Hey, suck it up. This will only take an hour. Then you'll have a pocketful of cash. So just be cool, OK? Fine. Fine. Let's just get going. He's cool. He's just got a weak bladder. There's Buzz. Hey, Buzz, man! Come on aboard. How are ya? - Welcome out! - Thanks, man. Good to be out. - What's with the hair? - Fuck you. - Who's he? - He's the driver. Junkies and faggots. Burning the warden, what a great idea! l'm sorry l didn't think of it during my eight years. He's such a pompous prick. lt'll serve him right. Absolutely. How many fish you figure he's hooked in his office there? The idea came to me after l'd folded my ten-millionth towel. Fucking warden makes a fortune cos he's using prisoners as slave labour. We did the laundry for 25 local dry-cleaners who all pay way below union minimum to the prisoners. lt's a huge scam. Quarter of a million dollars in untraceable, unmarked cash. ln small bills. Wow. - You sure? - Yeah, l'm sure. - Buzz, tell him. - Oh, yeah! lt's in there. Everybody inside knows about it. They move it in laundry bags. lt's all in 50s and 100-dollar bills. And that money is gonna be dropped off in exactly 12 minutes. lt won't be picked up for 20 minutes - the time it takes the warden to get from the prison to the laundry. There are two guards. Before he gets there, we're gonna walk in and take it. - Donny, you're the driver, OK? - Yeah. You're gonna be in the alley with the engine running. OK? Buzzmeister here is gonna crack the safe. Patrick and me'll make sure everyone stays nice and quiet. Nobody gets hurt. And we waltz out with a quarter million in unmarked bills. Very simple. Actually, it's fucking elegant in its simplicity, so let's keep it moving. We're right on time, buddy. The dynamic duo has returned! - Did Carl tell you... - 40 points in one game? Sure. We were fucking unstoppable! What was that you were saying about being unstoppable? God damn it, we only got 1 1 minutes, guys. Plenty of time. Plenty of time. The crew will fix it. Fuck. Oh, fuck me. - lt's a flat. - Oh, yeah, that's a flat. Come on, it's not gonna fix itself. Let's go. Two minutes. l thought you were gonna rent a new one. No, you said l should rent one. But l ain't got a credit card, so l can't rent shit in this town. lf you didn't rent this thing, how'd you get it? - Borrowed it. - What does that mean? lt means l borrowed it. - You didn't steal it? - No, not really. You hanging out with gypsy knife-sharpeners these days? You wanna do this? Huh? Then go away. Damn it. - Nine and a half minutes. - Think we're gonna make it? We'll see. - What did you say to the warden? - What d'you mean? When he asked what you're gonna do with your future and all of that bullshit. Told him l was gonna go into the laundry business. - No, you didn't. - Yes, l did. And that l'd be a success. He wished me all the luck in the world and gave me a big-ass box of cigars. l ought to be working in the lndy 500. - Almost done. - We got eight and a half minutes. Ah. With time to spare. You get it? Spare? (Laughs) You got it? God, l'm good. We got eight minutes. Let's synchronise watches. l don't have a watch. How can you go on a job without a watch? Hey, fuck you, tough guy! l used to have a gorgeous Rolex, OK? - l had to pawn it. - Sit...down. (Engine starts) Buzz, give him yours. My wife gave me this watch for my birthday. You'll get it back afterward. You afraid Mr Junkie's gonna pawn that one, too, bro? l'm fine. Not a problem. OK, let's call it 1 :25. And... - mark. - (Watch beeps) Oh, shit! lt's digital. l went past it. l gotta go around. Hang on. (Watch beeping) - Come on. Are you ready? - Hang on. Yeah, all right. All right. Yeah. OK. lt's 1 :26... and... mark it. Ah, shit! This is a.m. l gotta go round again. Hang on. - Patrick, can l talk to you? - l don't... Outside! Hey! Hey! Hey, l just about got it. - What? - l'm not going through with this. - You got to. We're here, man. - So fucking what? My simple and elegant plan is turning to shit in front of my eyes! l'm not gonna risk going back to the joint because of some van you stole! Or some strung-out junkie friend of yours, genius or not. l say we walk away. We come back in three months - when we can do it right! - lt could change in three months. You wouldn't know because you're not in the joint. - Your information is fresh. - So what? The hell with the whole damn thing! We'll get jobs like everybody else! Whoa. Jobs? You're not thinking straight, buddy. This is $250,000. lt's unmarked, untraceable. - And all we have to do is grab it. - Brilliant. Wonderful. You look me in the eyes and tell me nothing else is gonna fuck up today. Can you do that? What else could go wrong, man? Huh? OK, the truck is a piece of shit. But it got us here, didn't it? Donny, OK, he's got a slight drug problem but all he has to do is sit in the fucking van. lt isn't going perfect but it's going pretty damn well. Come on, buddy. Huh? l know you, man. You do not want to back out on a sweet deal like this. Do you? Huh? God has looked down on us and handed us this freebie in life. We gotta take it now or we might as well say ''Fuck it''. We'll never get another chance like this. That's it. Hm? You wanna look back on this someday and say, ''Shit, there was $250,000 and l just said 'fuck it'?'' Huh? No. l didn't think so. - l'm right, aren't l? - OK, you're right. You're goddamn right l'm right! l love you, man. Let's go! Yee-ha! OK. Let's get rich. OK. Everybody clear on the deal? - Right. No shooting. - This won't be a big deal. - lt's an easy safe. - Yeah? Why's that? The Universal 1205 is an old-fashioned model with a handle. When you push on the handle while turning the combination wheel, you can hear the bolt drop into the notch on the disc. You got to know what to listen for but when you do... it's a breeze. l buy locks. l take 'em apart and study during in my spare time. - They let you do that in the joint? - No. But l did anyway. Wouldn't it be faster just to blow the safe? Actually, no. Blowing a safe is quite a complicated process. Not to mention a noisy one, too. Man, l can pick this one way faster than blowing it. Well, well, well. Look at what we got here. That's us. (Car engine starts) OK, guys. 20 minutes and out. Let's go. - Aw, shit! - Hey, Buzz, you all right? Whoops. There's your alley. Go round to the back door. - l know, l know. - Are you gonna be all right? l'm fine. Not a problem. Just don't keep me waiting, huh? (Shrieks) l'm just a temp. l don't even work here! Do as you're told and no one will get killed. - Don't even think about it, man. - Come on. You don't know who you're messing with. - Really? Who? - You don't wanna know. You're right. Buzz, l'll get Mr Mueller here to open that door. - Keys are for fags. - Let's go. Sit down. You said this was a Universal 1205. lt's a 1 405. - Well, what does that mean? - lt's gonna take more time. l've been practising on a 1205. This thing doesn't have a handle. Buzz, you only got 18 minutes, man. That's it. - (Woman) Why don't you let me go? - Please be quiet! - Buzz, is 18 minutes gonna be OK? - l'll let you know. - For God's sakes, stop pushing! - Shut up, old man. Sit down. - lt's not the safe you said it was. - What does that mean? - lt's gonna take more time. - Well, go faster. Don't tell me what to do. This ain't my mistake. - lt ain't my fault! - Shut up. - You saying this is my fault? - lt's absolutely your fault. Friend, l don't like your tone. Don't you ''friend'' me. l told you to scope this place out. What happened? l paid a guy to do it, OK? He fucked up. - So can you open it or what? - l don't know. - You said you could open any safe. - Shut the fuck up. - You paid a guy to scope it out? - Yeah. So, what of it? Another person knows about our plan. We were gonna keep this quiet. l did. OK, so l told one guy. Big deal, man. Lighten up. 16 minutes. No, you didn't. Don't say you did when you didn't. That's bullshit. - How's that safe coming? - l have no idea how long it'll take. Lining up each disc takes its own amount of time. - How much time? - l don't know, man! l don't even have a fuckin' watch! l'd be on my way to having a 1205 open by now. Any second, armed prison guards are gonna be climbing all over your ass. Not any second. 15 minutes. - l can't do it in 15 minutes. - You damn well better! Threatening me won't get it opened any faster, asshole. OK, fine. Fine. Just lay off me. You lay off. We wouldn't be going through this shit - if you'd scoped this place out. - Are you gonna go on about that? So far you've fucked up your whole end of this deal! Fuck you, man! What the fuck happened to you in prison, huh? - You lost your faith, dude. - l didn't join a new religion. l planned a heist that's going down the shitter because of you - and it happens to piss me off! - You're starting to piss me off. l think you should relax a bit. Relax. Everything's gonna be fine. Trust me. Oh, Jesus Christ! Are you joking? Why do you keep saying that? - What? - ''Trust me. Trust me.'' You saying you can't trust me any more? - ''Any more.'' That's a good one. - You never trusted me. ls that it? You're my pal but let's not push this. So you never trusted me before? - Look, this ain't the time. - Oh, l say it is. Really? OK. What about the fucking Seaholm game? Let's talk about that. D'you remember? Who's out there doing a hook and go? Five yards out, wide open. Does he pass me the ball? No! He gives it to the moron halfback cos he wants to get in his sister's pants! What happened? What was it, l recall, a fumble, game over? Let me ask you something. Did you ever sleep with his sister? - Fuck you. - Did you? - No. - OK. Then let's just drop with this whole fucking ''trust me'' horseshit, OK? - Man, you've changed. - Yeah. l'm five years older. - Yeah, well, so am l. - But you didn't get any smarter. You got so many problems with me, what am l doing here, then, huh? What the fucking hell am l doing here? You answer me that. lt's because l'm your best friend, you asshole! No. lt's because you owe me. Oh, OK. Fine. We'll just get the money and get out, then. - Yeah. Fine. - Fine. - Good. - Fine. l got the first number. Two more to go. - Can you get them in 12 minutes? - Maybe. lt would be far, far better if you two would quit arguing about some high school football shit and figure out a way to buy us some more time. This fat fucker has got to know the combination. - (Carl) Except he doesn't. - How do you know? Don't push your luck, fatso. l'm having a bad day. 1 1 minutes, guys. OK, the warden will have two guards with him, right? l say we take 'em. Easy. What are you saying? You talking about killing 'em? Yeah, sure. Fuck it, man. The warden and these people, too? Don't be stupid. - Now l'm stupid? - And you're pissing me off. We wouldn't wanna piss you off, would we? l got news for you, buster. l am not stupid. You think you're so fucking smart, huh? So smart. Who spent five years in the slammer, me or you? Yeah. With your gun. You got five years, with my gun, and l walked. - Who's the stupid one now? - l guess it must be me. Because l didn't say a word about my good friend. Because that's what friends do for each other. l don't like anybody calling me stupid. Not you or anybody else. l am not stupid. l'm smart! - Ten minutes. - Come on, you little motherfucker! - Fuck! Oh, yeah, you're smart. - Yeah, l am. You failed every fucking class! You were in remedial everything. - You flunked fucking gym! - That's not what l mean. - So what do you mean? - Street smarts. OK, street smarts. OK, smart guy... what do we do next? We should have blown the safe is what we should have done. So you haven't got a fucking idea to save your life. Well, what do you got? Let me hear it. What you got? Nothing. Nada. Squat. Why don't we take 'em when they get here? lt's simple. You listening? We are not taking anybody. - Stall the warden. - l'm sure he's already... Then call him in his car. Tell him to pick something up for you, like cigarettes. - l don't smoke. - Listen, you cocksucker, you think of something cos l'm getting desperate. You understand? Yes, l understand. lt's all right, l've got it. Hello, Emmett. Yeah, it's Joe. l don't suppose you could stop and pick me up some ice cream? Double chocolate. Yeah, there's a 7-Eleven on the way. - lf you're fucking with me, you're dead. - What? - You're on a diet. - Let me do this. Yeah. l know l'm on a diet, Emmett. l'm breaking it. l know it's kind of weird. Just got a craving, that's all. You understand. Yeah, that'll...that'll be great. No. No, a pint'll be fine. Yeah. Yeah. Sure it's here. Yeah. Without a hitch. All right. l'll see you in a few minutes, then. There. (Sighs) OK. Seven minutes plus an ice cream stop. So? We'll see. That was way cool, dude. Way cool. Everything's gonna be all right now. Together we make this shit happen. You just gotta believe. - Jesus Christ. Just...shut up. - What the fuck is your problem? - Don't be talking to me like that. - Or what? - Don't tell me to shut up. - You must have a screw loose! ln six minutes, a couple of armed guards are marching in here. lf we get out of this nightmare, you're on my shit list! You fellas can still just walk away from this whole thing without a problem. You're never gonna get away with this. l got the second tumbler. Can you get the last one in five minutes plus an ice cream stop? l think so. You're damn lucky you got me, you know that? - l'm the best. - That's why l got you. These guys will get you. They will track you down and kill you. - You still have a chance here. - You wanna be gagged? l just got two words for you. You shut the fuck up! l have to go to the bathroom. Well, you go to the bathroom. Go on. Come on, knock it off. You can wait for five minutes, can't you? - OK. You'll be fine. - (Mueller) Where do l know you from? You better hope you don't remember, cos l'd have to come back for you. Come on, come on. Come on, motherfucker, come on! Come on. l'm saying this for your own good. Please just leave now. - l beg you. - Shut the fuck up, motherfucker! Or l'll shoot you for the fun of it. You hear me? Guys, four minutes. (Receptionist screams) - Shut up! Shut up! - (Whimpers) Jesus Christ, Patrick! Now you've really fucking done it! lf he's not dead, he's dying. What else could go wrong? You could say my name again, Carl. He's had a heart attack! Oh, good God! That's perfect! Now they're both dying! Don't start, man! This guy was trying to get away. l had to shoot him. Fuck! We got guns on them. They're not supposed to run away. - We have to get out now! - l just about got it! Jesus, that's them at the lights! What a fucking nightmare! - What happened to the ice cream? - l got it, l got it. Oh, yeah! Jesus. lt's all fives and tens. Then it probably ain't a quarter of a million. Let's go! (Receptionist) Somebody help! Oh, fuck! - Junkie cocksucker motherfucker! - There goes my watch. Another part of your brilliant plan blows up in our faces! Bad time, man. Very bad! - Turn round! - (Gunshots) - What the fuck you doing? - Going after him. Carl, come on! (Gunfire continues) Agh! l told you not to go back! You've been wrong about every other fucking thing! Why would l think you'd be right about that? - l get lucky now and then. - This couldn't have gone worse! - We got the money, didn't we? - l mean everything else. Everything else don't fucking count. We're rich. - We haven't gotten away yet. - We will. Just gotta keep the faith. l gotta get rid of these bags. lf anybody sees this blood they'll call the cops. Why did you shoot him? The cops would've never been brought in. - He was trying to escape. - You could've caught him easy. l didn't feel like it. Besides, he deserved it. He thought he could just waltz out. Didn't think l'd waste him. We pulled it off, man. l gotta stash this money. Hold up. Stop, man. (Both panting) Get rid of the money...and find us a ride. Where d'you wanna meet? How about Janie's? 2636 Virginia, number ten. l think it's that way. All right. 2636 Virginia. l got it. l'll see you in a few, all right? Everything's gonna be fine. Patrick, don't you leave me hanging. - You think l'd do that? - l don't know any more. l wouldn't, man. You be cool. All right? (Rapid heartbeat) (Groans) Oh, shit, it's them! (Panting) (Siren) (Police radio) Hey! Jesus! You scared the shit out of me! Sorry. You're bleeding, you know. Yeah, l know. You run around covered in blood, they'll lock you up. Put you in a cold shower and put bug powder all over you. - Yeah, l know. - Here. Here. Put this on. (Groans) Thanks. Here. Put this on. Thanks again. Remember, trust in the spirits. They're everywhere. - OK. - Especially in here. (Breathes heavily) (Patrick) You got five years and I waIked. (Prison guard) You'II be back. (Warden) Laundry's a good business. (Patrick) You got five years and I waIked. ( Guard) You'II be back. - Laundry's a good business. - No! Fuck! Shut up! - You got five years and I waIked. - Agh! You'II be back. You'II be back. Laundry's a good business. You got oive years and I waIked. You'II be back. You'II be back. You'II be back. You'II be back. (Distant siren) Come on, man. The thing's running just like a champ, all right? lf you don't keep it, you can sell it for ten times what you're giving me. - Oh, come on. - Oh, all right. - You got a spike? - Yeah. Not a problem. Everything's gonna be OK in a jiffy. Well, if it isn't Albert fucking Einstein. Oh, gee, l'm sorry, Donny! Did l interrupt something? l hope l didn't screw up your plans. Maybe l should've waited, huh? Maybe l should've waited just a little bit longer, huh? Maybe, like, five minutes? Maybe like five...fucking...minutes? (Groans) That belonged to Buzz. (Police radio) (Short burst of police siren) Carl! Oh, my God, you're bleeding! - What happened? - l'm not gonna stay, OK? Patrick's coming to pick me up and then we'll get lost. Don't worry, l won't get you involved in this. l'm not worried. Here, come on. (Groans) l knew you were doing a job. What was it? lt was a heist. We got the money, but not all of it. We were...we were going for 250,000. - Oh, my God. - lt was more like...25 or 30,000. And... a lot went wrong. Three guys are probably dead. l didn't kill them, but it was my plan, so l may as well have. Oh! - l think l'm gonna pass out. - OK, OK. Oh! God... Put your head between your legs. That's good. That's good. Here we go. God! Buzz was a friend of mine. He was my cell mate for four years. God damn it! He's got a wife and kids and now he's fucking dead or dying and on his way to prison, like l could be real soon. Come here for a second. Here. Have this. OK, OK. That's it. We're done. See? There you go. You OK? OK. lt looks good. OK... Here you are. Here you go. So, what are you gonna do now? l don't know. Me and Patrick will probably take off somewhere. Probably have to go to another country. God, Carl. l don't see you for 15 years and when you show back up you're Public Enemy Number One. Shit! lf Patrick had just gotten the type of safe down we would have been out of there. One simple piece of information. Sounds like Patrick screwed up. Oh, he did. He turned into a total fucking bonehead. l have news for you. He's always been a bonehead. Ohh... Janie, l'm telling you, in high school we were kings of the universe. Then high school ended and we couldn't get a fucking job. Why are you still friends with him? Well, he owed me and l couldn't think of anyone else. Yeah, and now look where you are. l'm here with you. Not for long, though. Patrick'll get here and then you'll leave and l'll never see you again. And that's just how it goes. Hey, hey, what's the deal with the yearbook? Oh, l pulled that out when l saw you this afternoon. A long time ago. - Yeah. - l was cute then. Actually, l was gonna look at my picture. But now that you mention it, let's just see. (Both laugh) Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were cute then. Look at you. Look at you. You still are. You have not changed a bit. Oh, get out. You really don't remember what happened in high school, do you? l... You know, l remember l was voted Biggest Hunk two years in a row. No, l mean between us. No. Unbelievable. (Sighs) We'd been going out for about a week and...you said you'd take me to the Prom. Then we were at some party and we had sex in a car. And at school on Monday you acted like you never met me before. You never spoke to me again, - let alone take me to the Prom. - Wait a minute. - Was that in a car by Cass Lake? - Yeah. l remember you now. You went psycho on me. You turned into a monster. You didn't wear a condom and you came! You shouldn't have let me get that far. Most girls back then didn't. Didn't they? Yeah, well, l liked you, Carl! - A lot. - l liked you, too. But the way you yelled at me, you scared me. What if l got pregnant? - Well, you didn't. - That's hindsight! Besides, pregnant or not, l never heard from you again. - You just forgot me. - No, no, no. That is not true. No, l did try and contact you. You worked in the high school book store, right? - Mm-hm. - Well... One day, when you weren't looking... l snuck in there and l signed it. ''Janie, it's really sunny. C.'' ''Janie, ''l'm really sorry.'' l never saw that. Well, l'm not surprised. l mean, it's pretty small. Wow. Janie, uh... l don't know how to say this. l'm sure it's gonna sound stupid, but... do you wanna come with me? - Where? - Oh, l don't know. Mexico, Australia, it doesn't matter. We'll have some money. l don't care about money, Carl. Well, we'll have some. What do you say? Go? With you? Yeah. What do you mean exactly? Here's what l mean exactly. You and me go somewhere together. - l don't know. - Come on. lt's a mess now but a week from now, lying on a beach, maybe everything'll be OK. Pi√±a coladas, sand in our shoes... - suntan lotion. - This is crazy! l know, but l think you and me could be good. Yeah, well, l always thought so. What happens when the money's gone? You gonna forget who l am again? No, l will not. Just don't yell at me again. Yeah, but...what are our chances? Well, l walk out without you, our chances are a surefire zero. l don't know, Carl. l need some time to think about it. Well...l'm sorry, Janie, but l'm fresh out of time. What about what l've been doing for the past ten years? Oh, come on. Who cares? Shit happened to me in prison that l'll never talk about. lt's history. The only thing that matters is right now between you and me. So come on. What do you say? (Blaring rock music) (Tyres screech) - You're serious? - You're damn right l am. But l mean you're really serious? You really want me to come? Janie, Janie, whoa, whoa. - Yes. l do. - (Footsteps on stairs) (Knocking on door) - Hey. What's going on? - l asked Janie to come with us. Can l talk to you for a minute? - l'll be back. Don't go away, OK? - OK. l won't. - What? - Not here. Get in the car. OK. What? She's not coming. She'll fuck us up. - She's coming with us. - No, she ain't. - Agh! - Sorry. l don't think you're thinking straight on this. Just hear me out. We're the dynamic duo, buddy. Come on! We... Remember how we used to make shit happen? We could pull off miracles. Add somebody else to the mix and it gets fucked up. You keep your nose out of my love life, OK? Who the fuck cares about your love life? l just shot a guy. Another guy had a heart attack. And Buzz got shot. Yeah, and whose fault is that? You wanna point the blame, go ahead. But we pulled it off. - You shot a guy and Buzz is dead. - Maybe. - No, probably. - Whatever. The point is... it works better when it's just you and me, man. Not Buzz, not some junkie. Not her. - l told her... - She's a fucking whore! A whore. We got enough money to buy all the whores you'll ever want. What is it, you gonna marry her? - Oh, l don't know. - ''l don't know.'' Fuck. Tell you what, you give it a month. ln a month, you still want her, you go ahead and call her. But right now, she's not joining us, man. She'll just get in the way and she'll get hurt. This is the best way, dude. This is ridiculous. l can't... l ca... l can't just pack up and leave. Go to Austria or wherever. Can l? Why not? What the hell is stopping me? (Laughs) - Carl! - (Car engine starts) - (Tyres screech) - Carl? Carl? Carl? Carl? You idiot. There were cops outside so l had Patrick drop me round the block. - You're here. - Of course l'm here. l said l'd be back. Didn't you think l was coming back? l didn't know. lt didn't look like it. Oh, Janie. lf l tell you l'm coming back, l'm coming back for you, OK? OK. OK. Oh... - So, guess what. - What? - Remember all that money l said l had? - Mm-hm. Well, l don't have it any more. - Why not? - Cos l gave it all to Patrick. l told him to fuck off and take it with him. - What did you do that for? - Cos he's a bonehead. He can have the money. lt's dirty. lt's blood money. So now you got a three-time loser. Just out of prison. Pulled a heist, got no money. And l'm on the run. Now do you wanna come? Now l really do. Don't you wanna stop and pack something?
