Good day madame Chopin. - Good day Monsieur Chopin. - Good day, Professor. - Good day, Isabelle. - Good day. Here's a pupil for you this morning, he's superb, he's superb. - And how's Madame? - The same thank you. And how is little Isabelle this fine day? Very well, thank you. But it isn't a fine day, it's raining. And what are you doing in this straw hat and slippers? But only yesterday the sun was shining. Who can keep track of all these changes in the weather? From Paris this morning, who sent it? Louis Pleyel, who's he? Let me ask. Who owns the finest concert hall, the greatest publishing house in Paris? Monsieur Pleyel. Who was it when he was traveling through Germany 15 years ago. Heard me play in the trio and shook my hand warmly and said... my dear friend, you were magnificent, I shall never forget you. Monsieur Pleyel. And now, who takes the time in far away Paris... to send an important letter to Professor Elsner of Warsaw, Poland? Who? - Monsieur Pleyel. - Monsieur Ple... Yes. Listen. Listen. My dear Professor Elsner, thank you for your letter... concerning the exceptional talent of your pupil Frederic Chopin. If the young pianist should ever find himself in Paris... we shall be pleased to give him a hearing. Respectfully, Henri Dupont. Secretary to Louis Pleyel. Well... Frederic in Paris? Naturally. For the past year I said to myself Joseph I said This gifted boy must be shown to the world. The world is Paris, Paris is Pleyel and Pleyel is your friend. Well, here's the answer. My dear Professor, Frederic is a little boy, how could he... My dear Madame, in Paris last month... a young pianist by the name of Franz Liszt made his debut. And he is 13 years old. Frederic is only 11. Well... What about that little question of money Professor? - Money? - For his trip to Paris. Yes. From my teaching of French, we're scarcely alive as it is. Oh, yes. Money. In fact, when did we last pay you for a lesson Professor? I refuse to fill my head with trifles madame. And that is final. I didn't say go to Paris tomorrow or next week but I do say let us plan for it and save for it. There's a boy waiting to be heard. And here is Paris, waiting to hear him. Someday, those two facts must come together madame. I insist upon it. Such tones form a piano. Mozart, as it should be played. The brilliance, the ease, the tech... Isabelle. Frederic. Frederic. More Polish prisoners. The Tsar is taking them to Siberia. Let's hope Freddie. And what about our lesson today? Come now. You don't understand, Professor. I don't understand. What? You are not a Pole. You are German. So? I cannot understand Siberia and freedom? My dear boy, music and freedom are like one. They both belong to the world. A real artist wants freedom in every country. Poland too? Who'll listen to him? Of course Poland. You mean you would even help? Help. What do you mean help? Well, I've been talking to Jan and Titus. When we grow up, all the boys are going to help. Then put down the name, Joseph Elsner. He's with you. - Thank you. - Professor Joseph Elsner. We have secret meetings. Will you come? - A pleasure my boy. - But don't tell father, he'd worry. I know. I know very well. Alright boy, let's start. One more time please. Is that Mozart? No. That's Frederic Chopin. I wrote it. Oh, you're composing now. - Mozart isn't good enough. - It's a waltz. I'm glad you told me. I would never know. - Don't you like it? - Off hand, not at all. But how can I tell until I hear it. Go ahead. I think it's very nice. I'll decide that please. For a little boy, it's not bad. It's feeling rather. In fact, a fair talent for composition. A distinct gift. In fact... That phrase was wrong. Very ugly. I like it that way. Oh, you do? You will please never say you like it, when you're Professor says it is wrong. Here, I'll show you. Such a stubborn little boy. Here. Alright, all right, if you want to be stubborn, go ahead. Beautiful. Frederic. Do you know what a wonderful city Paris is? Where all the great musicians and artists and writers are. Yes, Professor. Imagine playing there. And a 1000 people are shouting Bravo, Frederic. Do you know what they would say then? What? They would say this Frederic Chopin is Polish. His people ought to be free. Why don't we see to it? Do you understand what I mean, Frederic? What a way that would be to help. What a way? Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Professor. Lovely day. And you're wearing over-shoes. Oh, you never know. It may start to rain. A new dress? Tonight, for Frederic's concert at Count Wyszynka's. Don't tell me you've forgotten that? No, no, no, certainly not. Frederic is honored. He would play for the Count and his guests while they platter with knives and forks and stuff their stomachs. And you my dear friends will be allowed to stand in the pantry and peek through a crack. And for such privileges Madame, you go to this trouble. People will see us coming and going Professor. Yes. Yes. Yes. - Ah Monsieur. - Good day, Professor. Will he play well tonight, you think? Too well for Count Wyszynka. Professor, if the count is pleased, he may decide tonight. Frederic will be named to teach at the conservatory. Fine place to bury a genius. It would mean everything to us. Yes. Yes. Yes. It doesn't help matters to talk that way to Frederic about it. Me? Well, then Tsar is thinking about revolution. - You actually mean... - Calm, Professor, I know very well. He's been seen with that crowd of young firebrands, Jan and Titus... And that girl Constantia. All of them. He's been going to secret meeting. You don't say. You didn't know of course. Me? I merely teach music. Hands like Frederic's were not meant to carry guns. I agree Monsieur. The best way to serve his people would be to become great in his own profession. My very words. My very words madame. If if Frederic could find himself in places like... Paris again? Again? When did I last mention Paris? A week ago. There you are, seven days. By the way Monsieur, my small savings would be sufficient. Excuse me. I have no time today for Paris. Monsieur, one moment. I think Frederic should practice on my piano for an hour or two before the concert. It's slightly different, slightly better. It would make him more relaxed, more confident. I suggest he come with me now and stay through dinner. We can meet with all of us at the Counts in the pantry at the correct time. - If you think so, very well. - Thank you. Thank you. Well, lovely dress. Lovely day. What's this you're playing? When did you do that? - I am the idiot. - I see. Well then. Let's listen a bit. It's actually not bad. It's distinguished. And its scene is magnificent. What am I but the reflection of my teacher. Of course. Naturally. Liar. Well, did you see Titus and Jan? They're meeting us tonight. - The Russian arrived? Is he going to speak? - Yes. Yes. - What am I going to do? - You'll be there. With this concert to give? They'll start the meeting earlier, just for you. Then if we leave punctually at 9.00 we'll be just in time at the Counts. Father and mother won't let me out of this. Also arranged. - You're coming to my house, now. - But... To relax. Professor, you are a remarkable man. What have I been telling you? - Come, get dressed. - Yes. - Oh, mama. How elegant. - Not too far, Isabelle. Look at the time. Not here yet? - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? Maestro Paganini plays next, then your son. Where are they? Where are they. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. You want those rights too. So do my people. We have that one hope in common. Yet they tell us that the Polish people and the Russian people are enemies. Not the tyrants of both people, however, the little army of leeches under the Tsar. They aren't enemies at all. In fact, they get along quite well together. Strange, isn't it? Tyrants must've something in common too, to teach our peoples to hate each other. Giving us less time to think about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 'Cos if we should ever seize those rights, how awkward for the leeches? The weapons in this fight are printing presses and fiery guts. And they need money to buy them both. You promise to be very troublesome to the Tsar. In fact, in the interest of added safety he has thought it wise to send you a new governor of Poland. A man with a bloody record. The most efficient hangman he could find. This hangman is on his way to Poland now. His purpose is to hunt down meetings such as this. He will set spies among you. He will lay traps. We're late. I'm sorry, we must go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What would've happened if I didn't remember things? - Where have you been? - I'm sorry Father. Frederic. Well? You simply cannot get that boy away from the piano. Look at him. How can he possibly play at such a state? Frederic, it's Paganini playing. Well, at last. Be ready please. Chopin. Bravo Frederic. Bravo. Bravo. Encore. Encore. Your Excellency, we thought the roads would prevent you arriving tonight. May I present to you, his Excellency. The Governor General Of Poland. Newly appointed by his majesty, the Tsar. A place for his Excellency. - Please continue. - Yes, yes. Continue. You young man, continue. Well, we are waiting. I do not play before Tsarist butchers. What did you gain by it? Tell me. What could you have hoped to gain by it? Frederic will never teach at the conservatory now. That is certain. And I hope that is all, Professor. I hope the punishment stops there. Frederic. Why did you do it? Well, what are you waiting for? There'll be an order for you arrest by morning. - Get out of this house, Frederic. - Out of the country? Out of the country? Where? Where would he go? Why not Paris? - I hate to leave like this. - You must Frederic. Perhaps, the professor is right. Perhaps, he's always been right about Paris. - I have no heart for it. - Try Frederic, try. And don't forget us. Constantia. Frederic. This is Polish earth, Frederic, and don't ever forget it. Frederic. Pleyel. Pleyel. We should've stopped to clean up first. Waste time to clean up? My boy, we're here. Yes Monsieur. Yes Monsieur. Monsieur Pleyel please. Monsieur Pleyel? None other sir. We wish to see him. - Tell him Professor Els... - One moment please. What's the matter with him? He doesn't let me finish. - Professor, don't you think... - Quickly, your manuscripts. Take them out. Where are they? For immediate publication. We should be ready with half a dozen of the best. What is it you wish to see Monsieur Pleyel about? What is it. I wish to... - You, you are not Monsieur Pleyel? - No. Of course, eh. I know Monsieur Pleyel. - Who are you? - Henri Dupont. - Dupont. - Yeah. Ah, Dupont. His secretary. Delighted, delighted. Frederic Monsieur Dupont. - Is Monsieur Pleyel in? - Yes but... Well, then tell him. No, no, don't say a word, we'll surprise him. - Come Freddie. - Monsieur, he's extremely busy. - Ah but when he knows we're here. - Could you please wait? Monsieur, I ask you please. Pleyel. How are you, my dear friend? Why, you look wonderful. Simply wonderful. How glad I am to see you. Well, I brought in Frederic. Frederic. Come in, come in. What's the matter with you? There. There he is. As good as my word. This is Monsieur Pleyel. Shake his hand, Frederic. How do you do Monsieur? - Frederic... - Chopin. Chopin. Chopin. You must excuse our appearance. We rushed out from the coach to you. You can understand that, my dear Louis. Yes. Yes. Must be quite a journey. Indeed. Warsaw to Paris is no stones throw. You're surprised. You gave us up, I imagine. Gave you up? Well, then, to be frank... My dear friend, when Joseph Elsner writes he's coming, you can count on it. What? Wrote? Your letter must've been lost. No. No. You answered me here. Let me show you. You see. You remember. I'm, I'm afraid it was some time ago... Well, I'm aware it wasn't yesterday. But after all, how long was it? - Just 11 years Monsieur. - Really? Well, how time flies. Well, let us not waste any more time. You'd like to hear him of course. I know it's just a formality. Sit down, Frederic. Monsieur, I'm an extremely busy man. Naturally, so don't keep Monsieur Pleyel waiting. - Especially after 11 years. - That's what I mean. Go ahead. Sit down. One moment please. - Perhaps another time, Professor. - Now. - Professor Elsner. - Yes. I must inform you regretfully that a concert for this young man under my auspices is out of the question. Why? Because, because for one thing. Pleyel Hall is taken solidly for indefinitely in the future. I expected that. But when an exceptional artist appears you merely move everybody down one and you make a place. Oh, you do eh? If you were only a pianist. But you would want to publish his music too. Now where is he? Believe me, his compositions are geniuses. My dear sir. Genius sells three for a franc for every street corner in Paris. What? I, I don't understand. I speak very plainly Monsieur. - Come Professor. - But... But your letter. He was then what they call an infant prodigy. There might have been interest if you had brought him to me then. But infants have a tendency to grow up. And the prodigy becomes more prodigious. Out of the question. Out of the question. Professor, there are other auspices in Paris. The best is Louis Pleyel. I insist on Louis Pleyel. I will accept nothing less. Monsieur Pleyel, Franz Liszt. My music. Monsieur Liszt. - Maestro. - Ah, Pleyel. Who wrote this? This? Dupont, who wrote this? Monsieur... I don't know. Excellent. Ah, the composer. You do me a great honor Monsieur Liszt. What do you call this? Polonaise. It isn't finished. Polonaise. Spirit of Pole. Magnificent. Thank you Monsieur. And you play it with spirit too. As I am a patriot, I should like to shake your hand. I don't want to stop. If I play the melody and you play the bass, we shall each have a free hand. I'm in. Monsieur Elsner, could he be ready in two weeks time? Pardon me? I said, could Monsieur Chopin, get a concert ready in two weeks? You'll actually give him a... A concert. Yes. Isn't that what you came to Paris for? What a city. People not only look good, they smell good. Let's go back to our rooms. Eight hours practicing for one day is enough. Relax. You know where we're having dinner? The most distinguished restaurant in Paris. Celebrities at every table. So, I reserved the table for another celebrity. Look. On the walls, Frederic. Victor Hugo. Alexandre Dumas. Liszt. Balzac. Balzac. Pardon me. Look. The table reserved for Frederic Chopin. Chopin. Chopin. The great Polish pianist. This way Monsieur. Chopin. - Ah, you know, Chopin? - Never heard of him. Never, never heard of the foremost figure in music? Well, that's a confession of ignorance sir. - Indeed. - Indeed. Why in Warsaw the public went mad about him. On one occasion the famous critic Kalkbrenner heard him, - and simply raved. - I don't believe it. An ignoramus wouldn't. If you would aspire to culture sir, go quickly and get your tickets for tomorrow night's concert. It will be a positive sell out. How do you do Mr Kalkbrenner? Now, Professor, what's the matter with you? Little advertising never hurt. Balzac. What a world. Believe me, those fellows knew a thing or two about advertising. Come on, smile for a change. Relax. What you? What you doing? Something on the Polonaise. This is not the way to relax. Not the time for Polish themes. I said Relax. You know who else comes here? The great newspaper critics. That fellow there is from Le Figaro. And there's Le National. Back there is Le Temps. Le Temps. Oh. You made the rounds of the newspapers today. Soup. - Very, very hot. - Yes Monsieur. You said you wouldn't. I just dropped in for a moment. Where's the harm? Haven't you said that, A real artist would get to the top, sooner or later, by his own efforts. But, why later? It can be sooner. - What am I going to do with you? - Or without me. One critic I missed. The most important one. Kalkbrenner. They say he's a dyspeptic rascal. But I'll know how to handle him. I'll be very charming. You know, I can be charming. Ah. Chopin. And the Professor. George, let me introduce Frederic Chopin. I told you about him and Professor Elsner. Joseph Elsner. George Sand and Alfred DeMusset. I hope you like Paris Monsieur Chopin. I'm sure Paris will like you. Tomorrow night. I'll be there. George Sand. And The one with his nose in the air? Alfred DeMusset. Great poet. Yeah, he's sure of it. Sand. Sand? Novelist, one of the finest in France. Remarkable city Paris. His voice was peculiar. He is a woman, Professor. - What? - A woman. The man is the woman. Little unusual, isn't it? How do you know? Ah, well... I read just one of her books, it's the story of her own life. And does she say why, I mean, does he say why she... Why does she wear pants? Well, she was afraid... They wouldn't take a woman writer seriously, so she decided to take a man's name. And from there drifted into pants.- Remarkable city Paris. Eat, Frederic. And what will you have next Monsieur? Ah, let's see, the menu, it's gone. The one with your music cords. Where's the menu that was here? I'm sorry Monsieur. I took it away. - Away. Where? - I'll get you another one. It doesn't matter, Professor, I remember the notes. That's not the point. This is a room full of artists and they are thieves. Oh. That's it. Of all people. That bilious dog gave me such an argument. - This will be a play. - Professor. What kind of musical goulash is this? If you please. Man of your type should've nothing to do with music. Goes without saying that your was absolutely flat. You say that to me with my ear? A donkey has ears but does he know music? And for your information, this was written by that same Frederic Chopin. I am Joseph Elsner, his teacher. Professor Joseph Elsner. You'll be reading about us sir. On the contrary sir, I'll be writing about you. My name is Kalkbrenner. Oh, my goodness. Frederic. What's the matter now? Now, it's this collar, this, this button. How do you get into this, without choking to death? Help, I'm going crazy. Help me... I'll fix it. I'll fix it. You call this civilized? I would tie up lunatics in a suit like this. Look at you, not half dressed, we'll be late. I've been dressing both of us. Alright, all right. Take, take your time, take your time. Be calm, be calm. - How do you feel? - Calm. Well, don't worry. It'll pass over. Imagine you're playing in your own room at home. Pay no attention to the audience. - There. - There. Well, why are you standing like this? Have we got all night? Mind me, Frederic, don't be nervous. Don't be nervous. Come in. It's the post man, Professor. This time of night? What's the matter? A letter with four seals. Four seals? - From Warsaw. - Sign please. Frederic. A letter from Warsaw with four seals. Well, open it. - Well, well. - Alright, just a minute. My dear, Professor Elsner. - From Isabelle to you? Why to you? - I don't know. All of us are in good health and we send our most affectionate greetings. I'm writing this to you so that you can use your own judgment as to telling Frederic... Perhaps, I'd better not. Go, on. This very painful news. The night of Frederic's departure... Jan and our Russian friends were caught and imprisoned. For aiding in Frederic's escape. Frederic. Late as time. They are both dead. They beat them to death. Frederic. We're not dressed yet. We'll be late. Jan. Frederic, you have work tonight. Important work. Frederic. Frederic. - I'm sorry, Professor. - Frederic. Outrageous. Please, he, he was terribly troubled. This would not happen again. I assure you it will not. - You mean you would not consider... - Certainly not. I'm afraid you strongly overrated you pupil. No, I, I've strongly overrated you. Good Morning. Up all ready? Now the truth you didn't sleep? Not very much. How are the reviews of the concert? Reviews? Oh, the concert. Eh, I don't know, I haven't seen them. That's the Polish theme. Beautiful, Frederic, very strong. Come on, Professor, you have every morning newspaper there. - Oh, yes, I have... - How are they? Well, not bad. Not enthusiastic... In fact... In fact they are the most abominable things I've ever seen. You think they would admit that up to the time you stopped playing it was magnificent. But, no, wait. I'll read you the prize of the lot. By Kalkbrenner. May his dyspepsia grow worse. One passage here. Listen, to this. Apart from the fact that the young man has no musical memory and exhibited the emotion of a school boy, I would say about his playing, that he needs at least three more years of schooling, and a change of teachers. The last dig, that's, that was for my behaviour. And and and the... Your Polonaise you played, you know... You know what some idiot called that? Barbaric. It's a long walk back to Warsaw, Professor. We'd better start. Never. You think we come to Paris after 15 years and go home after one attempt? Never. I refuse to walk back to Warsaw. In fact, I couldn't. My shoes need resoling. This one I won't even dignify with a read. What's this? A genius such as this Frederic Chopin... appears only once in a hundred years. You hear that? A star has risen among us. Brighter than we've ever seen. George Sand. The man who's a woman. What's the difference, let him be half-goat. Here's a talking point for Pleyel. Here's a second concert in our pockets. Come in. Yes. By a messenger. By a messenger? I, I don't have to sign? - No Monsieur. - Thank you madame Mercier. Frederic Chopin, for you. Yes. Well... Well, what is it? What is it? My dear, Chopin, it would please the Duchess of Orleans if you and your teacher. Would attend a reception at her home tonight. George Sand. The Duchess of Orleans... How does George Sand know that... It would please the Duchess? Oh... This is Frederic Chopin. This is Joseph Elsner. Professor Joseph Elsner. Professor Joseph Elsner. Oh, Frederic, I think I brought two left gloves. Put the other one in your pocket. - How are you my dear, Chopin? - Monsieur Liszt. Good evening, Professor. This is all quite dazzling Monsieur Liszt. Yes, I don't know what's underneath but the surface is very highly polished. May I, steal your prodigy for a few minutes, Professor. Certainly, certainly. I'll get acquainted with a cup. Madame, I bring you Monsieur Chopin. Madame Sand. If you'll excuse me. I... I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me and for this invitation. Not at all Monsieur Chopin, you belong here among all the other distinguished artists of Paris. That's very gracious of you. Might I ask a favor of you? Of course madame. I want you to promise me for this evening, you'll execute all my orders, completely. And without any questions. First order is, sit down Monsieur Chopin. My dear Monsieur Kalkbrenner, I promised you I would play this evening. I deliver myself up to you. Splendid. Splendid. The Duke, the Duke, where is the Duke? With your greatest permission. Ladies and gentlemen, I present... Ladies and gentlemen. I have persuaded the greatest artist of our day to honor us. If you would appear to the music room, you will hear Maestro Franz Liszt. Your grace. I have a request to make. To create a proper atmosphere for the music I'm about to play. I ask that the room be darkened. What's going on here? The reception over? For some people, yes. For others, just beginning. Oh, yes. Well, thank you. Beginning? Liszt. Liszt is playing. But whose is it? I've never heard of him. That my dear friend, is by my pupil Chopin. Rather warm in here, don't you think? Anything would sound good, played by Liszt. Bravo. Bravo. Your grace. Ladies and gentlemen, permit me. One of the greatest artist of our time, Frederic Chopin. And who are you to disagree with Franz Liszt? Oh, Professor Elsner. Could I discuss a little business matter with you? Business? Now? Isn't that rather vulgar? And I want to publish Frederic's music as soon as possible. Indeed, you better, because mark my words, sooner or later they're going to steal those melodies. Exactly. Now you and Frederic will be at my office tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. - We can draw up the contract... - Tomorrow at 10 o'clock? Well, have to see what's on the calendar, besides... I should like to consider this a little. Oh, surely you're not thinking of asking for any better terms? My dear, Louis, I can guarantee nothing. Where's Frederic? Leaving with Liszt and Sand, I believe. - Oh, well. - Gone, Joseph. In fact, I'm afraid Paris has claimed him. The more honor to Paris. Can I drop you at your home in my carriage? Oh, yes, I don't mind. Arrived barefoot and leave in a fancy carriage. - Pleyel, I would like to... - I'm busy please. Eh, what's that, Joseph? Why I was saying, remarkable city Paris. Remarkable. To Frederic Chopings future. Whatever demands to madame. I owe it to you and to Franz Liszt. Oh, it was a pleasure, my friend. Though it was foolish of me to help. You're a little too talented. Tell me my dear, Chopin, what are your plans? Well, to give concerts, I hope, as soon as possible. Why so soon? Artists must live, George. And certain causes must live too. I'm thinking of my people back home. You see, there was a purpose in coming to Paris... Ah, I thought so. But I'm rather concerned about this, Franz. Look at him, pale and drawn. Now that's what purpose can do to a man. No, I, I don't like this at all. I suggest we take him to Nohant for a few days. Very good idea. And where is Nohant? It is George's place in the country. An entirely different world, where there are no purposes. Will you be ready to take the early coach in the morning? I'm afraid that is impossible. - Wouldn't you care to go? - Oh, yes, I would. Well, then, why not? Well, I feel that I should discuss a matter like this... With the Professor? - Yes. - Of course. Specially, such an important matter as a three day holiday. I shouldn't make up my own mind about such things if I were you. That wouldn't do at all. It's a pity, Franz, but Monsieur Chopin won't be with us. - I fell asleep. - It's 5 o'clock. And what are you doing? Now, don't be alarmed, Professor. I was going to wake you before I left. Before you left? I'm taking the early coach this morning. Into the country to Madame Sand's place at Nohant with her and Franz Liszt. I must still be asleep. Just a short holiday. For a week, that's all. But, wait, wait, we sign contracts with Pleyel this morning at 10 o'clock. Well, a few days won't matter. They do, Frederic. When Monsieur Pleyel is ready, we should be there. - I know but... - And no but. Please, will you listen? Alright, Frederic, I'll listen. But you can understand... After all she's done for us, I couldn't very well refuse. I see. So, without even discussing it with me? Certainly in a matter like this, Professor, I ought to be able to make one decision for myself. I can't be tied to your apron strings forever and treated like a boy of ten. Certainly, not. Point is, you want to go. Yes. Because you're grateful, and, you find it rather fascinating besides, I'm no connoisseur of woman with my weak eyes, but I can see that much, I can understand anything. But when it's a matter as important as Monsieur Pleyel... Because you say it must be this very morning at 10 o'clock. I simply say that when Monsieur Pleyel is ready... He'll be ready in a week from now. And you can tell Madame Sand, since you must've holidays that she can wait another day. - She's decided to leave this morning. - I see. And every selfish desire of the interesting Madame Sand is law. - Why do you say that? - Am I a child? I have eyes. I see trousers on a woman. I know that the woman has a will of her own and I have ears. I hear about her reputation, Books that shocked the world. And laws of conduct designed for herself, which is her own business except, when she interferes with business of Frederic Chopin and Joseph... Bye, Professor. Frederic. Take care of yourself, the dampness is bad for you. And have a good time. Do you hear? This melody is for you, George. Thank you, Frederic. It wants to say that I'm grateful. I'll never forget these three days in Nohant. You mean... It was delightful. So pleased to have known you. George. So pleased to know you, as long as I live. Really? We'll be in Paris together? Oh, no, I'm afraid not, Frederic. Franz and you will go back to Paris tomorrow. I have some writing to do. Here in Nohant? For work, Nohant is much too close to the world. There's an island off the coast to Spain Majorca. That's where I am going. But that's too far away. I wish you could see it, Frederic. Filled with sunlight and the moon there is incredible. Such peace and beauty, you've never dreamt of. I wish you could work there. For a while. Just a little while. You could write miracles of music in Majorca. Majorca. This is where I work. How can an artist serve a cause, Frederic unless first he serves himself. First you must find the best road for your talent. And follow it in the face of anything. What's your road, Frederic? Playing music, concerts? Many men can do that. Your genius is creating music for smaller men to play. Follow that genius, Frederic. Or you are lost. So is everything with it. Work. Shut the world out. This is what artists have been crying for down through the ages. A place apart, away from the petty struggles of men who have no talent. Be selfish with your genius, Frederic. Stay here. Write music. Send it back to Paris. And I shall prove to you, how a billion rabble will send you BACK everlasting glory. - Bravo. - Beautiful, isn't it? Yes, yes indeed. Nocturne. Look at the others. Every one magnificent. Waltz. Mazurka. Nocturne. Another nocturne. Waltz Brillante. Joseph, run through them. That was all he sent? All? Isn't this enough? I was, I was looking for a particular work. Oh, these must be charming. Don't misunderstand but, this was a bigger work. The unfinished Polonaise. The one he and Liszt played. Here. Together. I don't know about that, but these are magnificent. And how they will sell. Yes, I have no doubt. Go on. Go through them, Joseph. I'll take them with me. Meanwhile, you are arranging for Frederic's concerts. Concerts. Let him write works like these and there won't be concert halls big enough. When he returns. He told you he was not returning? I, no. - Well, why you think so? - Well I merely, didn't he tell you? Why, yes... He'll return very soon. Very soon. Good day Monsieur. Come in. Ah madame Mercier. - The matter we discussed a few days ago. - Yes, Professor. Alright. Had no word yet? I would've noticed a letter from Majorca. So you would. I'm afraid, I can't wait any longer, Professor. I'll have to have these rooms. I understand madame. Tomorrow. Thank you very much. Does it occur to you, that you may never hear from him? It does not. Only a simple old man like you would sit and wait for that young... Be quiet. You are addressing Joseph Elsner madame. A great teacher of music. As Franz Liszt will tell you. And Frederic will be back when he is ready for a lesson. Wherever I happen to be. Even in the Garrett. And as for your rent, I can still teach. And you will receive every cent of it, with a bonus for your incivility to Frederic Chopin, the great artist. George. Where have you been? - Walking. - In this rain? You might have told me you were going. I didn't think it mattered. You have your own private world at the piano lately. For example, this so called Polonaise jumble you have been playing for days. It's merely a mood. I thought I knew them all. This mood is something else again. Something that shuts me out completely. I didn't mean to. For all my attempts at frankness, I get... half expressed feelings and evasions. George... Isn't it apparent, that since these... endless rains began, that I haven't been well. Is that all it is, Frederic? And naturally... I'm not in the mood for waltzes and graceful studies. Your sure you are not aching for Paris? For Professor Elsner and causes? No. In that case, you've only to make a simple decision. George. I only want to get out of this place. We could go back to Nohant. We can take Majorca back with us. Living in the same way I taught you to live? Yes. No intruders, with the same contempt for what the world thinks or says. Back in Nohant with me? Is that what you choose? Yes. You certain, Frederic? One and two and three and four. Slow and deep and every note must dance and sing. One, two, three, four. Every note must dance and sing. No, no, no, no, wait, my boy. It's very uneven. Maybe you sit too low, wait here. Try this. How's that? I always used to do that with little boys. I got wonderful results that way. Now, again? One and two and three and four. Come in. - Monsieur Pleyel. - Joseph, how are you? My dear friend. Come in. This does me great honor. I had enormous difficulty in finding you, Joseph. - Oh, am very sorry. - Oh, I don't want to interrupt. Albert is very glad you did. That will be all my boy. Friday Same hour. - And practice. You hear? - Yes, Professor. Very nice talent. Here sit down. Thank you, I can only stay a minute. You might have told me you moved. Actually, I was going to. In another day or so. First I wanted to establish myself. How about a glass of wine, my dear Louis. No, thank you. I have only a moment. Establish yourself in a neighbourhood like this? What is the matter with this neighbourhood? I could recommend important pupils. Important neighbourhood. My dear friend. Musical talent doesn't look for the correct neighbourhood. A cup of tea, may be, eh? Joseph, I came to tell you that Chopin is back. Frederic? When? Where, where is he? He came back two days ago. He is at Nohant. Why didn't he tell me? Oh, Elsner, you are stupid. Where would he find me? Still if he went to Madame Mercier, she would tell him. But back only two days after a long journey. Why? What's the matter with me? What are you doing? I'm going to Nohant, what do you think am doing? Perhaps you ought to write a note first. Note. Who has time to write notes? But you, Louis. You better see to the concert. It's high time Frederic went to work. Did you hear me? - Yeah, yeah. - And please have some wine. No thank you. Perhaps, I better be going. Yes, you are right. I better be going. Good day, my friend and thank you. This way Monsieur. Come in Monsieur. How do you do madame? You had a pleasant journey, I hope? Yes, thank you. You do remember me? Professor Elsner. I wondered. Well. How is Frederic? We were quite certain you had gone back to Poland, Professor. To Poland? No, no I assure you. I'm right here in France. Frederic? You have no idea, after all this time, how this sounds to me madame. Could you tell him am here please? I never interrupt him when he works. Very good rule. I can wait. But believe me, this is one interruption Frederic would not mind. It is quite possible that he might. Or let me put it this way. He might be much happier to know you had gone back to Poland, Professor. Pardon me madame. I find that a very extraordinary idea. It's very simple. Frederic despises scenes. In fact, he is quite cowardly about them. And what he has to say to you, Professor, you will no doubt find unpleasant. I would? I would've to say that much has happened since he last saw you. His outlook has greatly changed. He has found his work in these surroundings. He would like to go on living as he is living now. If you don't mind, I would like Frederic to tell me that himself. As you wish. Excuse me. - Professor Elsner. - Yes. What would you say about the music, Frederic wrote in Majorca. Why, very charming. Is that all? Beautiful. I know Frederic's abilities quite well. What is it that you want me to say exactly? Has it made him the most talked of composer in Europe? Yes and also talked about. In a way I never thought to hear about Frederic. In any case, there are other things to do now. Things a little more serious. In his music writing. - And his concert work. - Concerts are out of the question. - Yes. - He is too ill for that. - Frederic? - That is, he was ill in Majorca. He couldn't stand the strain of concerts now. - Well, maybe not now. - Or any time in the future. He hasn't the temperament for it. Oh, how regrettable. What with a little effort on Frederic's part, I'm sure a suitable temperament can be found. Especially, since these concerts have a purpose madame. His purpose is to serve his own work. And that purpose is best served by what he is doing now. And your own, not too highly commendable purposes, they are also served madame. Oh, naturally that's how you desire it. And how Frederic desires it. Yes, of course. Example of your own life is... very persuasive no doubt, to one so young as Frederic. The artist living quite apart. Serving himself for his own greater glory and the world bringing gifts. But, it will please not enter. Merely set them down outside the door. I'm sorry madame. You are a lady of very strong will. Used to having her way in all things. But, I will not see you have this way with, Frederic. - You've decided that, Professor? - His whole life decided it. And I shall have my way in this matter madame. - As you are used to having? - Where Frederic is concerned? Yes. For twenty years, since he played his first lesson for me, since I listened to his first composition. Since, I encouraged him take his place as the first musician of our time for a reason we both believed in. Yes, I have had my way. Frederic. Frederic. It's Joseph Elsner, Frederic. Professor Elsner. - How have you been? - Fine. - Fine, thank you. Oh, excellent. - And the teaching? Excellent, I have a pupil or two. In ten more years, serious competition for you Monsieur Liszt. I don't doubt it. Something of Frederic's? Oh yes, yes. I happened to be passing and... - Well, I enjoyed our meeting Monsieur Liszt. - Professor... We haven't seen you for a long time. Monsieur Pleyel keeps me informed. Did you know that Frederic is not well? But, there is no danger. - You agree there is no danger. - Yes. Well then, what can be wrong? I'm very busy and Frederic is too, so... - Well Monsieur. - Well, he plays occasionally. I mean, in some salon. - Wouldn't you care to hear him? - No, thank you. Salons are not my circles. - I shall see that you are invited. - Thank you just the same. Good day Monsieur. Nevertheless, each time you shall be invited. The news will undoubtedly disturb, Frederic. This military upheaval? A thousand miles from Paris? I doubt it very much. Ah, good morning, Frederic. I'm late for my appointment, Louis. Please forgive me. How do you feel today, Frederic? Just in the mood for business talk, Louis. I haven't been sleeping well. Find some relief from this tightness. And I have a great deal of work to do. Several things I have been trying to put on paper. So, if it's nothing too important... He brings the same old story, Frederic. Every city in Europe will pay you a fortune for one concert appearance. People are clamoring for you. - You have the same old answer, Louis. - Of course. I realise, however, I still dream about just one concert in Paris. Give up Monsieur Pleyel. Frederic is heard to advantage only in the salon. You want me to pound the piano. Greet a lot of idiots in the gallery. You will excuse me. I'm anxious to work. Thank you for coming. No, I don't believe news of Poland will upset him very much, my dear Pleyel. Come in. Yes? Well? Constantia. Sit down. Where did you come from? - Monsieur Jollet, if you don't mind. - A letter for you. Thank you very much. You have been so good to help. Here, let me look at you. When did you leave home? You have been traveling for weeks. What are you doing here? Did you run away? - No. - No. No what? No, I didn't run away. You mean they sent you here. I went to Pleyel to find out where you live. I, well, that, that was the natural thing to do. - What do you need? - Nothing. I knew I wouldn't find you with Frederic. No, no, naturally not, I've been... The city would be bad for him. He needs the country. You know he is ill. I wrote it a thousand times. Your letters may fool his family, Professor Elsner. - But not us. - Oh, I see. I was trying to fool somebody. Let me understand this. The country air he needs is at Nohant, with Madame George Sand. Alright at Nohant. What is the different where? Professor, this last uprising, I can tell you it was pitiful. Clubs and knives against and cannons. And our best people not there to led them. They are in jail. Every man who can speak or think or write or paint. Titus, Carl all of them. With money we can bribe many of them free. If anything of the past, just a small spark is still alive in Frederic. If anything is alive in Frederic. What a preposterous statement. He is the same boy you knew. And I shall prove it to you, you'll see. And I will not have him slandered. You suppose that he could, but the man is seriously ill. Money from the sale of music, he can live that's all. Concerts where money is made has been out of the question. What, what would you have him do? Beg or steal as we would. Use his reputation. Gather his friends the great people of France that he lives with. And bludgeon them for help without shame or pride. Yes. He could do that. And should. I will have a talk with him, Constantia. Do you ever see him, Professor? Do I ever see him? Amazing question. You have made up your minds to everything. All of you. See him. Constantly. Here. Tonight. At the salon of the Duchess of Orleans. Frederic will play and I am asked to attend. Where ever Frederic plays will I please be there. - From Franz Liszt? - Yes, yes. Frederic's friend. My friend. Don't you see. Your questions are absurd. And of course, you'll go, Professor. And when you see him. Will you give him this? Well, I... I, I hadn't intended to go but... under the circumstances, I will. Bravo. Bravo. Your Grace will pardon me. I shall continue in a moment. You wish to see Frederic. That is why I came madame. Please. Monsieur Elsner came to see you. Good evening, Frederic. You are more ill than I imagined. Why did you come here tonight, Professor? We've both been busy for quite awhile, Frederic but... One day it was bound to be necessary, that we had a talk. This is not the time or the place. If it's important to Monsieur Elsner, as it seems to be, why should you avoid it? At any time or any place. To save time Monsieur, since the guest are waiting. There have been uprisings recently in Poland, Frederic. I believe that is what the good professor came here to tell you. I'm sorry to hear it. Naturally. And so is every decent thinking person. These are the sorrows of this planet which we all regret. They must be healed or burnt out, with time. I beg your pardon but the struggles of people... People who's struggle it is, Not Frederic. Nor any man who has any obligations to his genius. Peculiar. How differently we once felt? That genius is a rare gift. So many ordinary people seem to robbed, to make one such man. And the man worthy of the gift, should go closer to those people as it becomes more great. Fight harder for them with that same genius. But, what a waste of that gift. And a man who loses all decency and honor who flowers into a selfish, isolated fop. - Companion of a beast... - Frederic. We can't keep the guests waiting any longer. One thing Freddie... it will just take a minute. Constantia. You remember her. Constantia has come to Paris to ask for help. For such men as Carl and Titus who are in prison back home. I promised to bring her an answer. The answer has been given. I would help if I could. Money. Just money could break them free. Isn't it clear there is nothing I can do. Unless it's Frederic's life they want. In my opinion madame, he is not living now. Frederic. Frederic. This is where you live, Professor? Yes, I, I know. Well, how was the evening? Well, charming, quite wonderful. I think I'll walk a little. A young lady is up there waiting for you. Yes, I know. Frederic, what's happened? Forgive me for sending for you at this hour, Louis. What is it? Do they still ask me to appear in London, Rome Vienna? Of course. Then arrange such a tour in every city that wants me. And make it pay, Louis. Squeeze every last franc out of them. An art you know so well. But Frederic, are you sure of this? The money is to go to Professor Elsner. He will know what to do with it. But perhaps we should discuss this further. You must consider your health. I want to start immediately. Would you see to it please? - No I... - I'm deeply obliged to you Louis. Isn't this rather foolish, Frederic? You're evidently disturbed about this but... It's childish to rush to extremes. You can't do what is humanly impossible. You realise that? You realise that to make this tour is literally and actually suicide? We'll send off to Pleyel and tell him that you've changed your mind. It, it's late, isn't it? It is very hard to tear myself away. You see, we were talking... - Until now? - Yes. No, I walked a little... He was terribly moved. I can't quite tell you. Of course, goes without saying, he'll do something. Anything. Concerts would, of course be the answer but we have an idea how it looks. I doubt that the concerts will be possible. Still, he'll consider it. - Really? - I said he would. If it's humanly possible. You, you don't believe me? You've made up your mind, eh? I'm a, I'm a liar. Go back and slander Frederic at home. Don't listen to me. I'm going to swear to you, Frederic is Frederic. He's forgotten nothing. If he had an ounce of strength to give, he... He, come in. Joseph, I've just come from Frederic. He's asked me to arrange a tour. Did you hear what I said? Frederic, on concert tour. What's so amazing, my dear Louis, I was just telling this young lady... I was certain he would. You think this is strength, Frederic and high purpose? I call it puling weakness. You give your life into other people's hands, and the character you have left is what those people graciously let you have. No one knows this human jungle better than I. No one ever fought more bitterly to survive in it. To have had some talent and ambition and to be a woman, in masculine eyes, something slightly better than a herd of cattle. I buried the woman, wrote behind a man's name, wore trousers to remind them I was their equal. Yes. And was fully as moral as they were. No more, no less. Maybe you think it didn't cost a woman something to do it. Year after year, in the face of contempt and slander. But there was the reward to remember. I ruled my own life, and what I set out to do, I did. You took that example and became great. And now, if a thousand weaklings came to me to draw me into their hopeless causes, to ask me to lift their misbegotten lives with the wisdom I own, I'd see every last one of them rotting, first. That would be strength and dignity. Frederic. This is Polish earth, and don't ever forget it. A man worthy of the gift should grow closer to those people as he becomes more great. Fight harder for them with that same genius. Do you realise that to make this tour is literally and actually suicide? Encore, encore. Bravo, bravo. Professor... Constantia. The Professor? He'll be here soon. Franz? He's in the next room, Frederic. I would like to hear the piano. Would Franz play for me? Sorry to intrude Monsieur, but this was quite necessary. Shall we pause for a moment? No Mr Delacroix. Let us go on. Yes Monsieur? Frederic, is been asking for you madame. He's dying. Are you satisfied Monsieur? Do you know anything that could replace a life as great as his? Yes. The spirit that he leaves behind in a million hearts madame. Will you come to see him? I think not. Frederic is mistaken to want me. I was always a mistake. I certainly do not belong there now. Good day Monsieur. Continue Mr Delacroix. Sleep. She was too ill to come. I understand. You're always right. It's better this way. It's like coming home. That's right, Frederic. We're home. The trip to Paris was wonderful. Well... Didn't I tell you?
