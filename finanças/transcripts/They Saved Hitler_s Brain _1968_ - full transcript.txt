Mr. Van Pelt. I have the formula. I'm leaving now. Yes, Mr. Van Pelt. Yes. He's coming out now. Yeah, everything's been taken care of. Yes, Jenny? Good. Send him right in. Russ, how are you? Fine, Vic. Very good to see you. Sit down, please. I suppose you've seen this. Yeah. The papers are having a field day with this one. Rather delicate situation. I understand you worked with Dr. Bernard on the L7 project. He was a brilliant scientist. But a hell of a security risk. He had a big mouth. Liked publicity. We had to pull him off one of those talk shows during a commercial. Vic, what do you know about G gas? Just that Bernard was working on the formula for the antidote. You think there's a connection there? It doesn't make sense. The formula was on when he was killed. Could someone have gotten to it before the explosion? Not according to the lab. It was definitely on him when he was blown up. But the incredible thing is there was only one copy of it. And Dr. Bernard was the only one that knew the formula. - Bernard didn't discover the formula. - Oh, no? No, he would have liked to have taken the credit. But he was actually protecting the work of Professor Coleman. Professor Coleman? I didn't know he worked on the project. Well, not too many people do. He's working independently. Who else knows about the formula? Just Coleman. You want me to arrange security for him? No. I'll take care of that. I've got other plans for you, Vic. I'd like you to find out who would have a motive to kill Dr. Bernard. Find out everything about his personal life. See if he was a gambler. Find out what kind of women he was involved with. That sort of thing. Here's a dossier on Bernard from our initial security check. Why don't you take it home and look it over and see what you can come up with? Okay. I'll get back to you sometime tomorrow. Oh, Vic. I'm putting another agent on this with you. Have you ever worked with Tony Gordon? No. One of our best operatives. I'll have the two of you meet tomorrow morning at your apartment. If that's all right. Sure, that'll be fine. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Good luck. Yes, Jenny? Call from Mandoras for you. Thank you, Jenny. I'll take it on my private line. And oh, Jenny. Uh, take the rest of the day off. Thank you. Yes? Yes, everything went off as planned. However, there's been a complication. A Professor Coleman knows the formula. No. No one else. Yes, I know but - There was no way I could have known about him. It will be absolutely no connection with his death and the antidote. I've made certain of that. But what should we do about Professor Coleman? Good morning. Up here. I'm looking for 2713 Mills Road. And none of the streets have any names. And none of the houses have any numbers up here. This is 2713. The number's on the box. You Vic Gilbert? Yes. Tony Gordon? He's not here yet. But I'm expecting him any minute. No, I'm Tony Gordon. Oh, come on up. Come on in. Just made some fresh coffee. Would you like some? No thank you. Do you have tea? Sure. It'll just take me a minute. Made yourself feel comfortable. I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were a woman. I guess they didn't figure this was gonna be a very big assignment. You better call Van Pelt and tell him to get someone else. What do you mean? I don't want you to feel obligated in working with a woman. Obligated? I think it'll be fun. I mean I think it I would be - I know what you mean. No, you don't. Listen, Mr. Gilbert. I worked very hard to get a job like this. Don't think I'm giving it up just because I'm another fickle woman. I don't think anything of the sort. Well, here I am defending myself and I don't know why. Wait a minute. You know this is not gonna look very good in my report. Oh, so now you're gonna blackmail me into working with you. Blackmail, nothing. You don't have to work with me if you don't want to. But if you're that thin-skinned. And that's going in the report too. You know you're really disgusting. Coming from you, that's a compliment. Look. Before you go storming out of here, at least have your tea. Come on. We've got work. Sorry you had trouble finding a place. It happens all the time. Have you read Bernard's dossier? Yeah, I read it last night. It amazes me that he ever got security clearance. What makes you say that? There's no record of his activities between the window of '46 and the summer of '47. It just says Unemployed. So what's so unusual about that? He was in Mandoras, South America. Now why didn't he put that down? How do you know he was in Mandoras? Cause I picked it out with a passport viewer this morning. You think that means something? Well, I don't know. But it seems strange that he omitted it. Do you know what he was doing down there? No, but I checked out Mandoras. They have a lot of American operated diamond mines down there. And there are a lot of rumors about former Nazis involved with the government. Yeah, those rumors pop up during a lull in flying saucer reports. You don't believe it? What, flying saucers? No, the Nazis. I'm sure there's some fanatics down there hiding out but so what? That could mean something. Look, before we start jumping to conclusions, let's nail down some facts. I made up a list of Bernard's friends and associates. Including Professor Coleman? Now what do you know about him? I know that he was the real developer of the G gas and the antidote. I'm impressed. That happens to be one of this country's best kept secrets. I'm not even gonna ask how you found that one out. Good. You didn't answer my question. What question? Are we gonna interview Professor Coleman? No. Why not? Van Pelt's taken care of that. Are we gonna compare his notes? No. We're gonna compare our notes. We're just gathering the information. His boys are gonna do the analysis. I still think we ought to look into him. That's out. We'll start with Bernard's sister. She lives in Reseda. And we can swing over to El Camino Institute. And talk to his assistant. You make terrible tea. I guess a man's place definitely isn't in the kitchen. Touche. Well, that was a wasted afternoon. I still think Rebecca Coleman's our best bet. I agree with you. But that's not our assignment. Let's go see him. What could it hurt? What are you trying do, get us canned? Well, they're not gonna see in myself. Look, I appreciate your enthusiasm. I don't appreciate yours. You know it's not very pleasant having to pull rank on you all the time. But you're telling me. And we were getting along so well. Let's keep it that way. All good. It's getting late. Do you want me to take you back home? Yeah, maybe we can get a better start in the morning. The next minute will illustrate the effects of G or nerve gas more effectively than any words. The spray has wrecked its nervous system. G gas kills humans in the same manner as DDT kills flies. You die by suffocation. A slight spray is sufficient to paralyze the brain. The gas is here illustrated in an open area. But it can make its way through the most minute openings. And is virtually undetectable. One cannot see it, taste it or smell it. It doesn't burn or irritate the skin. You die without ever knowing what hit you. Is there any protection against it? I'm afraid not. Not adequate enough. Ordinary clothes and masks are not sufficient. Concrete buildings, tunnels, subways, air-raid shelters offer no immunity. How far will it travel? A small cylinder of gas when released will travel approximately 750 to 800 square miles. Depending upon the wind. Who else has this gas? Many nations have it. The only we've recently completed the antidote. What about the antidote? Up to now, atropine was the only known antidote. We worked on perfected one more powerful with almost positive results. We call it POM. Pyrazine, 2L-Doxycycline, Methyldene. Or Formula D. It's top secret. A few people outside of myself know of it. The loss or destruction of the formula for this antidote would mean complete annihilation of the world. Professor Gordon. Sorry. No one's allowed in here without a pass. But I must see the professor. It's of the utmost importance. Please. Let me see the professor. Information regarding the D antidote to nerve gas. You have to wait for another briefing. At the international chemical warfare conference in Washington next week. Any further questions? In that case, the meeting is over. Thank you for your attention. Well, professor, will you be able to join us for dinner? Sorry, Phil, I can't. How's the new job? Fine. 'Cept for Kathy calling me a cop. That she would. Oh, sorry. This is Frank Dvorak, my new assistant. Phil Day, the genius that married my older daughter. Glad to meet you, Frank. Did I hear you say you were a policeman, Mr. Day? No, but my wife thinks the CID is just a big fancy police station. - I'd better get home, John. - Bye. Phil. Glad to have met you, Frank. Your son-in-law seems very nice. Phil, he's a good man. Here. I'd like to have you check these figures for me. Coleman speaking. He has a daughter Suzanne. Do not contact the police. Go to her apartment. Frank? Nothing. David... David... David. Where's Suzanne? What's happened? Guess. I don't know. - I dunno. Isn't she here? - No. The last thing I remember is we were working on some sketches. Yes. There was a knock. Suzanne went to the - the door. These two men came in and they - They sure beat me up. That's all I can remember. Who are they? What'd they want? Would you recognize them? No, never saw them before. I can't imagine what they'd want. I've got to get to a phone and call the police. There's a toll one at the corner. Sure. I'll go with you. Hold it. In the car. Come on. Move! Quick! What do you want me to do with him? Tie him up. Put him in the back room. Hello. Mr. Van Pelt? I know I'm not supposed to call you. But I think we gave Professor Coleman an overdose. I don't know what to do. You coming down here then? Okay. Let's get some air in this place. Hey! Mike, get the car! Hello? Vic, this is Tony. You gotta come quick. The Nazis have taken Spencer Coleman. Wait. Slow down. Slow down. 112 Honey Street and hurry! Where's where? Let's get us a table. Mike. Tony, can you hear me? Hey, Tony. Tony! Meow. Meow. Drop that gun or you're dead. I said drop it! Russ! What are you doing here? Looking for Tony Gordon. How did you find out about this? Russ? What is it? Get out of here, Victor, They're gonna kill you. Tony! Mojito? No. Thank heaven. I was afraid it was my husband. Let's not talk about that yet. Your drink. You know, Mrs. Day. You have more effect on me than a mere drink. Senor Day. Senora. Please. I must speak with you. What do you want? Please. Come to the car. It is very dangerous for you to be seen with me. Dangerous? You know that. Please! Get into the car. Come on. Let's go. Senor Day. Do not make me do this. For it is of the utmost importance that I speak with you. Where to? Does not matter. Drive anywhere. Senor Day, senora. You must forgive my method. But I have tried desperately to reach Professor Coleman. Now it is too late. They have taken him to my country. Mandoras. Oh, quick. Pull over. Why something's wrong. What's wrong? I don't know. He's shot. Oh. I am hurt. I am scared. Please. Do not call the police. Ohh.. Magic. Shown this way. I swear, man, I - Oh, Phil, he's dead. Yes. Now what? Phil, what are you doing? Here. Find out who he is. Your father doesn't answer. He must been telling the truth. Nothing. We're leave him here. They'll find him soon enough. Come on. Let's go. AGHHH! AGHHHH! AGHHHHH! Quiet, kinda pretty and the back house's not too bad either. I'm afraid we don't have much time for socializing, Mr. Sharon. Oh, it's a pity. The only people to come to my door nowadays is those greedy businessmen. You know it was nice flying with both of you. I'd like to give you a card. But I don't have any. But you can call me at my office. The Global Mining Corporation. Very well. Goodbye, ma'am. Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. Darling, we were the only people on that plane besides Mr. Sharon. You sure we're doing the right thing? I don't see that we have any choice, K.C. Whoever abducted your father probably killed that man in the car. And his message was pretty plain. What's the matter, darling? Hello, Mrs. Day. Welcome to Mandoras. I am Chief of Police Alaniz. I need to see that you have transportation to your hotel. We're honored. Thank you. Tell me. Do all visitors get the royal welcome from the Chief of Police? Or are we special? I'm just a poor policeman, senor. My orders are to take you and see that you are made comfortable. Please follow me. That doesn't answer my question. Follow me, please. Everyone's so friendly. Please follow me. I see what you mean. Pardon me. And this will be your hotel. This? This. The only one we have. Follow me. I'll work on her. Here we go. Senor. All our accommodations seem to be prearranged, senor. We are just trying to make you comfortable, senora. That's all. I think we must be their millionth visitor. Follow me. Will you be posting guards? The senor must be joking, of course. Julio here is no guard. He sleeps too much. Andela. I hope you will be very comfortable. Good bye. Bye. Tell me what's going on here? What's happened to Suzanne and what's happened to dad? K.C. baby, I don't think we have anything to worry about. As far as Susanne's concerned, these people have more to worry about here than one harebrained - Sorry. As far as your father's concerned, I'm not so confident. But that chief of police acted more like a bellboy. So he must be under orders from somebody way up. Darling, what are you looking for? Don't oppose me. Hold it, honey. ARGGH! Angel. This guy is terrific. Not only does he knock you out, he put you to bed. You're not so bad yourself, my friend. Don't give me all the credit. I had help. You? With a wife like this, who needs a girlfriend? Oh, Phil. Weren't you at the airport? Yes. I'm sorry for being so secretive. But it's nothing. I am called Camino. That doesn't tell us much. What's going on? Sister's free to come and go as she wishes. You're watching closely. It's important for all concerned that she stay alive. You see. She was used as bait to force Professor Coleman to come. It's my fault? You know where he is? He can't come here but - Perhaps you will see him soon. At the airport, I put something in your pocket. A book of matches. Saw them in the cottage. Matches go this way in Dos Palabras. Friends. Anything happens to me. Go to Dos Palabras immediately. You saw my father. Why can't he come here? Bernardo. It's not his choice. You are also being used as bait. In Mandoras, it started with a small Nazi. No great attention paid to it at first. Huh? Surely, a few fanatics can't upset the world. Not today. It happened before. It was a fanatic who upset the world a great deal. To do it again. To do what? What do you mean, again? It all started on the 1st of May 1945. The regular program was interrupted with an announcement. The voice said: We have a grave and important announcement to make. The Reichfuhrer Adolf Hitler is dead. Before he died, he appointed Grand Admiral Donitz as successor. In a few minutes, Senor. The people heard the voice of their new leader. Admiral Donitz said to them: I speak to you in the solemn hour, as the successor to our Reichfuhrer Adolf Hitler. Who died this afternoon. Fighting heroically as the head of the troops who will win. A large part of the world rejoiced to the news. Berlin fell. The war in Europe was over. But the whispers began at once. Is Hitler really dead, they asked. Charred bodies were found that were alleged to be of him and Eva Braun. But a lot of rumors had to be checked out. Nothing was left to chance. A good deal of manipulation and help. My brother Tao had free access to the inner sanctum of it this bunker. He was a laboratory technician. The rumor was that Hitler was getting his daily shots of hormones from a battery of doctors. But the truth was worse than that. He had a tremendous fear of death. And created a succession of mysteries. There were attempted assassinations. None of the assassinations hurt him or killed him. Someone. But not Mr. H. He practically never appeared in public. And the legend that he was indestructible started to grow. Bash in the roof in here. It's time to take it. It's an honor. It's an order. Quiet. It's our time. It's our time! We must survive. Then the war turned. At the same time, his best medical advisors were being forced to their greatest effort. Mr. H was convinced that they could give him perpetual life. Nothing had been left a chance. All who had participated in the experiment were eliminated. The end came quickly. My brother Tao was severely injured but he didn't die. And he never forgot what he saw that day in the bunker. As the news grew hopeless and a bomb fell on that bunker, several people were cremated. But not Mr. H. He had already been perpetuated. And the long-planned easy escape was carried out. Hitler alive! It's incredible! I didn't say that, senora. I said he is not dead. This is too fantastic. - Believe it. - Believe it? Please. I need your help. It's like some kind of a bad joke. In our day. The dead man in that car, a bad joke. He was my brother. The same who was in Berlin in 1945. He went to you for help. But why me? What can I do? What is it they want so badly? They have the gas. They want to destroy the professor's antidote. Wait a minute. Pick it up. Si. Si. Gracie. What's wrong? You see that man down there with a beard? Yeah. That is Bascus. Remember him well. And he's called the assassin. Very careful. I repeat. Be very careful. I'll be near when you need me. Gracias. I wonder if we're still being followed. Isn't everyone? Oh look! Do you have a coin? If we're lucky, we could come back here for our second honeymoon. Darling. You have the wrong town. I wish you hadn't bought these things. Right now, it's all ours. How many in your party, senor? Uh yeah. Uh, better make it three. You're from the States, aren't you? Si. Cleveland, Ohio. Be careful. They're breakable. Take five, cat. What a gas. Holy cripes. Well, what a bummer to do. What are you doing down here? Well, it wasn't my fault. Those guys had long guns. And that David Garrick was no help at all. Let's have some saoco picante. This place really blows. Dos the salsa. Eh dos salsa patras ee uno. Senor. Let me order for you. Dos salsa patras. That's an order. This sounds like a silly question. Cha-cha-cha. But are you all right? No, thanks to dear David Garrick. Boy, I feel hot tonight. You better glum this hubby of yours. He's getting saucy about us. Glum this hub? Now listen to me, Suzanne. This is very important. What are those guys look like who kidnapped you? Like the craziest. No no no, what I mean to say is. How did they act? Did they say anything? They were very nice. They pulled a gun on us. Told David to split. Those shaved cats said they wouldn't hurt me if I be happy. Shaved cats? You know, guys with crew-cuts. Scrape me over a bird and fly me right here. Yeah yeah. Uh, then what happened? And this time answer in English. What could happen? When we landed here, they gave me some money. Fixed me up in a hotel. And said I could run and play as long as I called nobody back home. Never glum a pony in the castle. Never look a gift horse in the - I know. Ah. Wasn't there anything distinctive about these guys besides their hairdo? Well, now that you mention it. They did talk kind of funny. What do you mean, Suzanne? Golavia. A lot of morons in here. I sure liked Oliva. Yeah yeah yeah. Germans. You dug it deep. Germans. Wipe off the glasses and the ashtray. Light? Darling. Darling. If she asks you to dance, you'd better not. AIIII! Oh I'm shot. AAAAIII! What happened? Howdy, senor. You must go. I will be of help. Maria. Maria, are you badly hurt? Take this. The ladies? Where'd they go? No comprendo. No comprendo, senor. Sorry, Senor Day. But you are under arrest. But my wife and her sister were kidnapped under your eyes. And you're arresting me? What for? For the murder of Carlos Vasquez, inspector of police. What about my wife? I don't know. Well then, help me find her. I'm sorry but you are under arrest. I didn't even know that man. I don't even have a gun. Give him to El Gorde. What kind of a police chief are you anyway? I'm very good police chief. I always obey orders. Most of the time. Take him. Where is this jail? Now look. Chief of police or no chief of police. If I don't get some answers soon, I'm gonna start a revolution of my own. Please, senor. Let us have no trouble. There's been too much violence already. Quite a little jail you've got here. I wonder what your president's palace must be like. We are but a small country, senor. This way please. - Kathy! - Phil! Oh, Phil! Oh, I thought they had killed you. Okay. Break it up. Well, what happened? Well, if you'd been watching me instead of that belly dancer, you would have seen what happened. And two of the cutest guys you've ever seen grabbed me as the shots rang out. Oh. Did they get you, eh? They killed Vasquez. If that's what you mean. Senor Day. His Excellency Presidente Juan Padua wants to speak with you. Excellency, may I present Senor Day? It's an honor to meet you, Senor Day. I have found your wife and her sister charming. You're very kind, I'm sure. But I'm wondering why you've had us brought here? Will you have a drink, Senor Day? Senora, senorita? Thank you, no. Noo! I'm still wondering why you've had us brought here. Senor Day. You must understand. You are in Mandoras. And here in our country, we have very strict laws. Yes but my wife and myself have done nothing wrong. Oh, neither have I. You may go. There is the matter of the murder in the cafe. Now look. You know perfectly well we had nothing to do with that. Why did you bring us here, really? Very well, Senor Day, I will tell you. You have become a part of our plan. However unwilling. Within a matter of hours, we will begin the conquest of the world. You may go. Come. I'll show you. There's the reason we were brought here. No, senor. He wasn't. Here. Here. Here. And here. We have cells ready to attack. Others have been built in every country. Including the United States. I hope you've been comfortable at your hotel room. Mine stinks. How are you, miss? Ugh. We haven't had the pleasure formally. Tom Sharon's the name. I've heard a lot of nice things about you. Mr. Sharon. Will you tell us what this is all about? And how you fit into this little rat race. An unfortunate choice of words, Mr. Day. Let's just say have a certain amount of interest here in the mines of Mesa Blanca. A businessman's interest. Other than that, I'm as much of an outsider as you. In fact, more of an outsider than you. However, I trust and believe in our Presidente here. And want to help him do as much as I can to better his country. You're expecting any help from me, you've got the wrong man. I don't think so, Mr. Day. Alaniz, take them. Guardia. Take them all below. Here we are. It would be more polite to say that you are a guest of the state. It's quite an honor. Let's all have another drink. While our friends get oriented to their new surroundings. It's like a growing harder. Oww. Your head. Professor! Professor, are you all right? Yes. Yes, I'm all right. All right. I'm still worth more alive to them than dead. How did they get you here? They came and got me. David and me as we were leaving Suzanne's apartment. Phil, I'm afraid for David. He doesn't know anything about the antidote. But I won't tell him anything. Dad, it's my fault. I'm sorry. I never thought that they would ever... Ahh. This is unfortunate, Mr. Day. But we must learn certain things about the professor's antidote. He has been stubborn. Now that you are all here, we will try another approach. Oh, David. What'd you do? Oh. Oh, David, I felt sorry for you. Your pity is misplaced, Miss Coleman. Our plants will go forward with or without your willing cooperation. In a matter of hours. The world will belong to us. Your giant bombs. Your huge armies will be dust in front of us. If you cooperate, you won't be harmed. So you are the superior ones. The slappers of women. The torturers of old men. You sit in a crumbling castle dependent on Professor Coleman's formula. You really can't be sure how many others know his antidote, can you? You're bluffing, Mr. Day. Do you think any of this anything but incidental? I will show you what you're struggling against. I will show you the ruler of the world. You will come with us. Ahhh! Thank you. Don't love this. Where did you get this, Professor? I - I don't remember. Oh, yes. One of the young guards gave them to me just before you got here. - Guards? - Yes. So it's worth a chance then. What's worth a chance? Time for a break. Some of these people here must be on our side. The trick is to stay out of the way of those that aren't. This might be our chance. Now be quiet. Phil! Oh gosh. Try me a little later, honey. Let's get out of here now. Very good work, Senor Day. Oh it's the crazy thing it back. I did not judge you wrong, senor. I knew you were a man to be watched. You're trying to rush me for this gun, senor. It is not necessary. Please, Senor Day, take it. You may need it. Please believe me. My people and I are as much prisoners in our country as you are. My family has been broken by these men. One son murdered. The other hiding in the darkness. Denied for his own safety. One more thing, senor. You were brought here for your own safety. Bascus meant to kill him at the cafe. El Camino wasn't kidding. Camino. He's my son. Your son? Si. Now you must hurry. I have two cars waiting outside. The drivers have been dismissed. Two cars? Si. He's right. We stand a better chance if we break up into two separate groups. That way one of us at least might make it to the Dos Palabras for help. Si. Hurry, senor, hurry. Must go through. I think the guards will spill of it. No matter what happens Excellency. They won't take you. Gracias, amigo. Come. To better our chances, the president and I will take a different route for Dos Palabras. Senor Day. You stay to the main highway. All right but the professor and I had better stick together. Kathy, you and Suzanne go with Alaniz and the president. Oh, no. I'm going to with you. One of these days you're gonna get us in trouble. All right. Let's go. Will they let us through the gate? I am the Presidente. Idiot, I told you to go. - Is the thing ready? - Yes, sir. Call an extra car. We'll be downstairs in exactly 10 minutes. Yes, sir. Attention. Attention. Operation G goes into effect immediately. I repeat. Operation G goes into effect immediately. Two German generals are flying here tonight. To meet the war effort at the Karana caves. They've been planning the conquest of the world for 18 years. Now that - that thing says that the time has come. Do they really follow its orders? Does it give orders, Senor Coleman? Does it really give orders? Better hurry, Excellency. All personnel. Assemble in Corridor D in five minutes. I repeat. Corridor D in five minutes. You are not in uniform. Operation G has begun. Now look. I'm getting just a little sick and tired - The pigs stow fatigues when the Fuhrer gives an order. You will obey like everyone else. I'm not in the army. You stupid fool. Did you really think you were better than the rest? - Has he been prepared? - Yes, sir. You have duplicate apparatus in the car? Everything is ready, sir. Mein Fuhrer. Everything is as you ordered. The truck with the soldiers has been loaded. The gas is ready in its cylinders. You will see your great victory, Mein Fuhrer. That, I promise you. March on. March on. Take him to the car. Are you coming? I wish you were with them, K.C. I'd feel a lot better. You'd feel a lot better, darling. But I wouldn't. Oh, Phil, someone's following us. How am I doing? About the same. Well. We ought to be in town any minute now. We'll never get rid of them in this. Let's ditch. They have a flashlight, K.C. so keep low. Come on. We've only got a couple blocks to go. Come out, Phil. It's easier on Kathy. Let's leave that. When I think of all the... Time is getting short. I don't intend to be here at midnight. I know where you are. AAAYYYY! AAYYY. What's the use, Phil? At exactly 12:15, everyone in this town will be dead. Now we need this area for our base of operations. Once the two containers of G gas are open you know what will happen. I don't want to have to shoot you, Phil. We want you to come with us. We could just leave you here! His Luger shoots eight bullets. I want to try to get that last one. Stay here. Ohhh! I guess you're out of bullets now, David. Not exactly, Phil. AAYYYYHHH. AAAYYYHHH. AAAYYYHHH. AAYYYHHH. That was a lucky shot. - Ohh! - It seldom is, amigo. Fortunately... Ohhh. Before he died, he told us they were gonna release the gas in the town at midnight. Yes, we know that. Professor Coleman and my father are over at Dos Palabras. We better get out of here. So we've got to hurry to Karana caves. If we're lucky, we should make it within an hour. Get your wife to the car. Come on. Come on, darling. It's all right. Julio. Give a little push. You said we'd meet David first. You promised. We're going to the plaza. He will be there. Something has gone wrong. There's no one in the plaza. Where have they gone? Stop here. You'll live. You killed my son. That will be enough of that childish sniveling, Sharon. The Americans killed him. No. You killed him. You want to kill everything. Because you know that's the only way you could rule the world. If you were the last man on earth, you... and that evil thing... killed my son. I can't drive any faster. The roads are completely deserted, Mein Fuhrer. If the Americans escape, the world may know of our plans. But it is too late for them. Generals will arrive by midnight. Before morning, the gas will be released as you ordered. Now listen. We'll have to go to the rest of the way on foot. There's only one road to the rendezvous point. We know it'll be watched. So follow me. Go this way. And now. Just over the hills are the caves. We'll be a few hundred meters above the place where Gen. Kurna's plane will land. Won't there be any soldiers? With a weapon like G gas, what need have they of soldiers? Come on. Won't be much longer, Mein Fuhrer. Some of us will have to work our way down. There are many places to hide. Pablo and I will go down here the landing. That plane should be here soon. - I'm gonna start. - Buenas noches. Johnny. Please be careful. What time is it? 11:50. Sounds like the plane. I hope they don't spot Camino and Pablo. Why, it's Dvorak in that car. They must have the G gas out here too. No soldiers, huh? Over there. We have the grenades. Against soldiers, they are old-fashioned but effective. I hope know how to use yours, Senor Day. Planes should land about there. I'll make my way down to that cave. I know a good back way. Camino can get the soldiers. Pablo can get the plane. Somebody's got to get Dvorak. I guess it's up to me, K.C. There's been a change in plans, Mein Fuhrer. We will go to the town and release the gas ourselves. Thanks a million, my friend. Without you, this new peace would not be ours. Confusion and surprise have won more than one war, Your Excellency. Where is that daughter of mine? We have to leave soon. That must be her now. She's terribly sorry but she's gonna be late. Hello? Oh Susie, we thought it was you. Where are you? Where? She's in Camino's bedroom. She's where? Oh... so... well! How did it hap - I mean when did you...? Congratulations, daddy. Your daughter is married. Congratulations to you too, Your Excellency. Well, this calls for a celebration. There's still time. How's the bar downstairs? Better than the one at the palace. Good. Let's go. How about changing your name today? But what did you have in mind, Mrs. Day? Like what comes after day? Ohh.
