[instrumental music] [sighs] - Hey. - Hey! [sighs] Every year we say we're not gonna read too much and every summer we're bursting. If you wouldn't insist on bringing that thing. "That thing" may be a dusty old antique but it helps me brainstorm when I'm stuck and considering I only have five weeks to finish my book.. [inhaling] ...I need it. Ugh! This whole sequel thing is much more difficult than I thought. Then it's a good thing you'll be spending all summer with me for inspiration. Absolutely. [both chuckling] - Hi, Maureen. - Hi. - Hi, Maureen. - Oh, wait, wait, wait. Final check. Did you grab your retainer? Yes, it's in my mouth. Please don't pretend lisp. Ally, did you get your summer reading? You can just call it homework, mom. As long as you have it, sweetie, we'll work on semantics later. Can Grayson ride with us? If any of us were packed, yes. You sure you don't want us to wait for you? As much as I'd love to get my hands on your super neat packing skills you remember last year? - Ooh. - And the year before? - Yeah. - Yeah. We're a slow-moving team. You're right. We'll meet you there. See ya. [chuckles] Bye, guys!

Is it near Ocean Burger? You always wanna go to Ocean Burger. And you always wanna go to Splash Cafe. Well, we're changin' it up this year. New rental house, new summer camp. Does that mean it's not near Ocean Burger? [Jenna] 'We can still go, it just means that we have to' 'drive to get there.' Alright, we're gettin' close. - Tell me your goals. - I don't have anything new. It's just, I wanna make swim team next year. Well, you've got all summer to practice, bud. You can do it this time. Can I just eat chocolate all summer? [Jenna laughs] Um, no. You can have some chocolate, but maybe you could pick a goal that's a little less sugary? Hmm.. I know. Play at camp, so you could finish your book? Ooh. Both of our goals rolled into one. I like the efficiency. Thank you. Oh, here it is. - 'Are you guys excited?' - 'Yeah.' 'I'm excited. Oh, you guys, check this out.' 'The beach looks awesome.' - 'I'm not going.' - 'Oh, this is so--' [Nick] 'Mom, look at the huge turtle.' [Jenna] 'Oh, that's so cool.'

I've always wanted one. [Jenna] Oh, that's not our dog, sweetie. Maybe, like, half of him is ours? Can we get the top half? We don't even know if he's friendly yet. - I call top bunk. - Actually, we have two bunks. Then I call biggest cookie. Do you ever stop thinking about food? [Ally] I don't know, maybe someday, when I'm older. [instrumental music] [Nick] I think I can see the summer day camp from our bed. Should be real close. Like, walking distance close? I think so. This welcome basket's really cool. Hmm. Why don't you guys tackle this box while I take our beach toys out back? I'll give you my cookies if you empty that box. Deal. - Whoa, I'm sorry. - Whoa. I'm sorry, I didn't.. I didn't expect a shower to be in the middle of our place. - Sorry about that. - Yeah. You must be the new neighbor. Um, yeah, we just checked in. I...just wanted to find somewhere to put this. Yeah, I don't think it really matters where you put it. I'm Lucas, by the way. Lucas McKennon. [sighs] Well, Lucas.. I'm gonna let you finish what you're doing and I'm gonna put this away. It was nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. Good luck. Oh, wow. [chuckles] That's Tank. Hi, Tank. Uh, I should probably get inside before my kids think you ate me. - Get out of here, boy. - Down, down, down. So, um, are those your kids that I saw out front? Uh, last I checked, yeah. And your husband, is he still-- Oh, ex-husband. He's in Japan for work. Oh. You look kinda young to have kids that old. They're really not that old but...thank you, I think. You don't have that caffeinated dazed look that most parents have. You know the one, it's like, they're just, "Argh!" They're just wrecked, you know that kind? So, no kids for you then? [laughs] Me? No, no, no, no. The, uh, furry kind are as close as I'm gonna get to kids. Great. Well, it was nice to meet you. - We didn't. - I'm sorry? Oh, we didn't officially meet. You never told me your name. Oh, right. Jenna. Jenna. Jenna what? Turner. Well, Jenna Turner.. ...now we've met. [light chuckle] Yes, we have. Bye. You gotta push down on that. [doorknob rattles] This way. Yeah, got that. Thanks. [Jenna] Big day tomorrow. Let's try to sleep until the sun actually comes up. Tell that to little Miss Chatty. [scoffs] I happen to have a lot of important things to say. [Jenna] Yes, you do. We will talk about all those things when the sun comes up. I love you monkeys. Mmm. [sighs] [dog barking] [Lucas] 'Hey, Tank! Unh-unh. No barking.' 'No barking.' 'Good boy.' [sighs] [rock music blaring] [sighs] Seriously? [seagulls squawking] [Kayla] 'There will be time trials' at the beginning and end of the five weeks to track your progress. Think of it as your personal best. Aside from that, summer camp is all about having fun. Do you wanna race to the end? To the end and back. Let me guess. They're competing already. It never fails with these two. [chuckles] [whistle blows] And it looks like Nick is really pushing himself. He is. He just needs a little more self-confidence, that's all. And it looks like you need a little more sleep. [sighs] I blame my neighbor for that. Ooh. Why does that sound more scandalous than it is? He was blasting music all night. Who does that? Well, is he a surfer? Yeah, a messy one, who probably sleeps until 10:00 every day. Nah. What do I always tell my students? Middle school is like Middle Earth? That, and that you should always follow the two-week rule. Looking good, Nick. [Jenna chuckles] So, what's the two-week rule? Well, you should always give it that long before you decide if you like someone or not. I mean, otherwise, it's a snap judgment. - Yeah, I don't do that. - Uh, really? - Mm-hmm. - Uh, what about Mr. Splenda? Okay, he had a seriously unhealthy addiction to sweetener. And the airplane guy? He took his socks and shoes off before we were airborne. Besides, I wasn't dating them. Which you can't keep avoiding. I'm not avoiding it, I'm just.. approaching it with a much more critical eye this time around. That sounds so romantic. Either way, this is a neighbor thing and trust me, he's totally Mr. Slack. Okay, fine. I'll give it two weeks. Good. [chuckles] [instrumental music] What the.. No, no, no, Tank. Oh, no, no, no. Come on, man. Oh, come.. No, no, not the book. Come on. Let's go. Time to go home. [Tank barking] - Hey. - Hey. I think this guy belongs to you. What are you doing over there? Get in here, you. Get in. Either trying to play with, or rearrange my book. I don't know, it's really hard to say. Oh, well, I always said he'd make a great editor. - No? - No. Cute, but no. Hey, uh, one other quick thing if you have a second. Yeah, of course, come on in. Come on in. Come on, buddy, inside! 'Come on.' So, I just wanted to ask or, uh, maybe suggest we set some ground rules? Yeah. About what? Well, the dog, for starters. - Oh, you're not a dog person. - No, I love dogs. I mean, I like them, my daughter loves them. My ex-husband keeps promising to get them one 'but I'm just too busy to commit to a dog right now.' 'I mean, it just wouldn't be fair to the little guy.' Especially considering I have this book deadline and I'm not quite sure how I'm gonna hit it. Oh, you're a writer. What do you write? Like, uh, novels or plays? Teen fiction. Huh. It's a lot harder than it sounds. Which is why I can't risk any distractions right now. So, I was hoping you could keep Tank on your side of the fence, so to speak. [laughs] No can do. What? There is no fence. It's a shared patio. [chuckles] But...you know what I mean. Also, I don't know if you realize but the walls are, like, paper thin. So, if you could keep the music down past, say-- Look, Jenna, I really appreciate you bringing Tank back but, um, I live here year around. Oh, right. You don't even have any plants. What's that got to do with anything? Never mind. You were saying? I get that you're gonna be here for a month-- Uh, it's five weeks, actually. Right. Either way, um, I mean, I'll do my best but you might wanna just learn how to relax. I'm sorry, you want me to relax? Yeah, I mean, it might be good for you. Just as a suggestion. Anything else? No, I think we're all set. Hmm. Good boy. Relax. Telling me to relax? Please, I'm totally relaxed. [sighs] [line ringing] Hey, so forget this two-week rule. I need your help. Yeah, I think that should do it. If I had my way, I'd lock you two in detention until you worked it out. But there's nothing to work out because I called it. So, he is Mr. Slack? And completely arrogant, which is a deadly combo. [chuckles] Oh, I thought you said this wall was for the dog. It is. It totally is. Oh, come on, don't make me look crazy. I just think it's a little extreme. Or an easy solution. Alright, now listen you want me to start building a moat? This is far as I can go. Right. A moat. See, that would be extreme. [chuckles] - Oh, hey. - Wow, that was fast. Uh, so you got my note about all this? Yeah, I got it. I just didn't think anyone moved that quickly. On anything, especially a wall. Well, it helps to know a contractor. Oh, I thought it would help to marry one but I'm still waiting on my new porch. Well, that's because I've been so fixated on you, dear. You're lying, but at least 'you sound cute when you're smiling.' [chuckles] Oh, sorry. Maureen and Ian. - My good friends from home. - Hi, Ian. - Nice to meet you. - Lucas. - Hi - Hi. We've heard so much about you. All good, of course. - Ah, now you're lying. - Oh. - Should we go? - Yeah, I think we should go. - Yeah, thanks. Uh, thank you. - Yeah. I appreciate it. See you guys. [Ian] 'Mm-hmm.' Just so you know, the wall is for Tank to help me relax, as you so poetically put it. Sure, it is. What's that supposed to mean? [kids chattering] Don't go too far. Stay where I can see you. [Ally] Okay, mom. [Jenna] 'Have fun.' 'Be safe.' 'But have fun.' [indistinct chatter] I'm just saying I get it. - Get what? - I get it. I'll keep my furry kid on this side if you keep your kids on, uh, that side. Oh, you want me to keep my kids contained? It only seems fair. Doesn't it? Alright, fine. Yeah. I feel better already. [Ally] How often do you walk him? I don't know, he's kinda low-maintenance. 'Cause I can do it if you want. I think we're good. Or I could teach him how to sit or roll over. I bet you're a really good swimmer, right? - Since you surf all the time? - Come on, Tank. - Ah, well, I wasn't always. - But you are now. You guys always this chatty in the morning? Not me, she's the early riser. Which is why I can walk your dog. He likes to sleep in while I'm surfing. Do you think you can give me some pointers? - Come on, Tank. - On surfing? Just swimming, I wanna cut my time to make swim team next year. You know, I'm not much of a teacher. - Even if-- - 'Sorry.' It's not really my thing, buddy. Who wants the first stack of pancakes? Nick? Ally? [Tank barking] I think something's wrong with him. He won't sit or listen. He likes to move at his own pace. [sing-songy] Kind of like his owner. You guys need to get ready for camp or something? They do, which is why they should be upstairs getting ready instead of down here bothering you. Her words, not mine. Well, what if we're already ready? Does that mean you don't want your pancakes? I'm sure that Tank would love to eat 'em. Oh, no, he prefers small children. I'm kidding. [Jenna] Cute. Did you put chocolate chips in them? I might have. Yes, come on. I'll meet you up there. Well, have a nice day. I always do. [instrumental music] What are you thinking, boy? [barks] [chuckles] Me too. [whistle blows] Alright, good job, guys. Let's break for lunch. Alright, come on, dude. Those fish tacos are calling your name. I'm not really that hungry. Yeah, well, I can't have anyone passing out on my watch. So, you're gonna have to eat something. I promise they're worth it. Hi. [Lucas] 'Hey, you.' 'Oh, looks like I'm just in time for fish tacos.' Well, yeah, well, this week you're gonna have to cut in line. - They're a hungry bunch. - What? You didn't save me one? I'm gonna find some new friends. [chuckles] Good luck with that, McKennon. [chuckles] How's Nick doing out there? - You know him? - Neighbor of the month. Well, he starts off strong and then he just sort of picks up. But I'm sure he'll get there. I'm sure he will. [instrumental music] Hmm. [instrumental music] [sighs] Mm. [indistinct chatter] [rock music] What the.. [indistinct chatter] - Whoo! - Yeah, alright. Come on, man, I'm trying to work. Oh. Oh, you're my man. Yeah. Uh-oh. Am I the only one who works around here? Nah, I'm just kidding. But seriously, am I? If you haven't noticed, volleyball is hard work. Yeah, especially when you're winning. Hey, don't get ahead of yourself, we just started. Yeah, well, I just started too, and it's not going so well. So, I was hoping that maybe you could just turn the music-- Keep it quiet down a bit? Yeah, that would be awesome. - You got it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Alright, what is it? - Four-four. 'Yeah.' What? Too loud? - Little bit. - We'll keep it down. - Set it up. Oh! - Come on. [laughing] [rock music] Here is to my beach warriors and a fantastic summer at camp. How long is it again? Well, that's the spirit. Can we cheers now? Yes, cheers. [chuckles] Maybe I should just learn to surf instead. Why would you wanna do that? We don't normally live near the beach. I don't know, our neighbor does it. Yeah, I'd rather you not try anything our neighbor does ever. Okay, now tell me how you really feel? No, it's not a feelings thing, it's a health and safety thing. - Sure. - What? It is. - Who wants steak? - Alright. [instrumental music] Rise and shine, monkeys. It's the weekend. What time is it? I'm hungry. Then I guess we better hurry up and figure out what we're gonna do? We could go to the sand dunes 'or the butterfly park.' Can we just go to the beach? Yeah, I guess we could go to the beach. I don't know, what do you wanna do, Ally? I wanna go to the beach. [laughs] Alright, the beach it is. Let's do it. Wow, you're doing a really thorough job. I can still see your toes. Yeah, maybe we should just let 'em breathe a little bit. Nope, I need another bucket. [chuckles] Is that our neighbor out there? He's not a criminal, mom. - Why don't you like him? - What? I didn't say I didn't like him. He has to be nice. His dog's nice. [laughs] I think owners look like their dogs, sweetie. I'm not sure they act like them. Where's my mermaid tail? [chuckles] Hey, buddy, how's it going? How are your lap times coming along? They're fine. Fine? What's that supposed to mean? Doesn't matter. I'm not gonna try out for swim team anymore. 'Cause you don't want to, or because you're afraid to? Listen, I know this is not your thing. [chuckles] - Did I say that? - Twice. You know, a very wise dude once said.. "You miss a hundred percent of the shots you don't take." Is that some sort of Yoda quote? No, that's a pretty good guess, but no. It was, uh, Wayne Gretzky. - Does he surf? - Okay, that's not the point. The point is if you're interested.. ...and my schedule lightens up-- My mom says you don't have a schedule. Well, your mom doesn't know everything. Like I said, I was thinking that if you're interested.. ...I could give you some pointers. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, don't get too excited. Just 20 minutes, here and there. - Nothing major. - Cool. I mean, yeah. Sure, I'd be up for that. Alright, so we'll figure it out. - Oh, and, Lucas? - Yeah? Can we maybe not tell my mom about this? I'm not too sure she'd like it. Mum's the word. Get it? Sorry, I had to. [seagulls squawking] [instrumental music] [waves crashing] Alright, now to strengthen your stroke you need to learn how to swim like a surfer. Seriously? Just focus on shortening the number of strokes it takes for you to get to the other side of the pool and I promise you'll catch a ton more waves. But I don't surf. That's not the point. You wanna break 118 or not? [sighs] Then, go, go, go! Wow. What, are you getting soft in your old age? This helping kids thing is new for you. It's one kid, just one time. Well, that's what you think. Easy breezy, right? They go in for the hug, and it's all over. The next thing you know, you're wearing mouse ears at Disneyland because you couldn't bear to say no. - Are you done? - Maybe. [Lucas] 'Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.' [chuckles] Hey, stop, stop. [guitar music] [fire crackling] [indistinct chatter] I don't think we have enough marshmallows for everyone. Actually, I don't think there's enough room for us, sweetie. Sure, there is. Hey, you guys wanna squeeze in? - Yeah. - Yeah. It looks like you're having a party, we can just come back. Trust me, you'd know if we were having a party. Scoot about. Who wants marshmallows? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. See? Plenty of room. [guitar strumming] Yeah. [Ally] 'Can I wake him up?' See how his eyelids are fluttering? That means he's just about reached REM cycle. - His what? - 'Ally, honey.' Why don't we leave Mr. Tank alone, okay? But.. ...daddy said I could get a dog. I'm sure he did, honey but dog sure would be kinda tough right now. We've talked about this. Can't you just change your mind? She doesn't do that. How about this, how about you take Tank for a walk tomorrow morning? Would you like that? [chuckles] Awesome. Wow, that is pretty nice. You sound surprised. I'm not surprised, I'm just.. Actually, I think we should get going. - We should? - Yeah. Oh, right. Yeah, we should, 'cause I'm pretty wiped 'and I've been working on this new swim technique.' It's pretty cool, actually. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. My mom likes to watch "Real Housewives--" Okay, we're going now. Let's go, please, now. - Come on. - What? You do. - Could you just stop? - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Tank. See you in the morning. - Hey. - Hey. - I'm glad you could make it. - Yeah. There's room on this side. [instrumental music] [Jenna sighs] [instrumental music] [snoring] [knock on glass] [Tank whimpers] [knocking continues] [sighs] You wanna get that, buddy? [whimpers] Alright, alright, I'm coming, I'm coming. [grunts] Some guard dog you are. God. You said morning. Leash, please? You left your door open. Alright, I don't have any rules. Just bring him back when you're done. You sure you don't wanna come with us? That would defeat the purpose of you walking my dog. Except you might have fun. Nah, I'm good. I should get back to my nap. Suit yourself. Go on. [chuckles] [Tank barks] [instrumental music] [barking] Tank, come on, spin. [Ally sighs] 'Tank!' 'Please.' [barking] Come on, Tank. Come on, spin around. - Spin around. - Sorry, buddy. - She's a taskmaster. - Tank, get up, get up. Just like her mama. [sighs] [whimpers] [Nick] 'I don't get it.' So, she's learning to sail but it's only so she can get to the Lost Island? That's the idea. At least that's how I'm writing the first draft. And she's only 11? So, does that mean in two more years, I can sail too? [laughs] It's just fiction, sweetie. Besides, she comes from a long line of sailors. Your grandparents came from Chicago. Two very different scenarios. So, how does it end? That's a good question. I thought it was due, like, really soon. Soon-ish. But I'm not worried, so you can't be worried. Great, should we go home? Go, go, go on, boy. Get it over. That's it. - Uh! - Oh. Ahh, what up? Oh, come on. Hey, bud. [Lucas groaning] [laughs] Hey, Lucas, do you need any more players? Yeah, I guess we could use some extra bodies. Why, you interested? What about my mom? - What about her? - She used to play in college. Really? Hey, you used to dig? What do you mean? [Nick] 'Oh, I was just telling Lucas' how you used to play volleyball in college. It was like a 100 years ago. You should play. Right now? Are you any good? Team captain. Huh. I'm having a hard time picturing that. Why? Because I'm wearing a cardigan? That might be part of it. You know what? Let's go. Let me guess, you wanna be on my team? You and me. First to ten. - So, this is a challenge. - Oh, yeah. And, uh, if I win no music past 9 o'clock. [laughs] And if you win, I won't complain about your little mid-week matches anymore. You got yourself a bet.

Oh, wow, you're always just right there, aren't ya? Yeah, well, I suppose you could've built a higher wall. Ah, believe me, I thought about it. Hello? Hi. How are you? Yeah, I'm just running upstairs to go write right now. 'I'm..' 'Uh.. Mm-hmm.' Am I almost finished with the draft? Absolutely. I mean, it's practically writing itself. [instrumental music] Hey! Hey, hey! Huh? Uh, what, no. I-I was just saying, hey, I should, um.. I should probably finish up that ending. [chuckles] Excellent. Bye. [sighs] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Can you-can you stop-- 'You know, I gotta admit, I really love' this Chaz Man character, but this Yachtman.. he's a little stiff for my taste. Are you seriously giving me notes right now? What, a surfer can't have a literary opinion? - I didn't say that. - Yes, but you thought it. And you thought it was okay to just grab it. All I'm saying is that all of the sailors I know are just normal people that love sailing. They don't run around wearing brass button jackets and ridiculous-- Okay, we're done here. Thanks very much. Besides that mess of a character I'd say you got yourself a really good story. Hmph. You're impossible, you know that? What? I'm giving you a compliment. You're welcome. [Jenna] 'It's like a total invasion of privacy, am I right?' Uh, can you slow down? That's the problem, I can't, like, not even a little bit because I'm, like, 50 pages behind and my neighbor is so not helping at all. I mean, every time I sit down to work bam, there he is, he's like a.. ...annoying insurance commercial that you turn on every time you turn on the TV. Maureen? Are you alright? I think I missed that last bit. See, I'm not even close to the house and he's still driving me nuts. Well, if you guys are anything like my seventh graders you taunt the ones you like. Yeah, I love you, but no. - That's not it. - Maybe? I promise you, this is not some middle school crush. He doesn't even like me, he's just impossible. Maybe I was talkin' about you. What? No. I don't, I can't-I can't.. I can't be distracted, so no. Okay. Then what are you gonna do about it? I don't know, check my blood pressure two times a day? Okay, maybe three. I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to come up with a better plan than that. [light chuckle] Right. A plan. Oh. That still seems best. Please answer. Please answer. Please.. [automated message] 'Please leave a message at the tone.' [beeps] Hi, um, this is Jenna Turner at your Seawatch property. I hate to do this, but I was wondering if we could change rentals? Uh, the location is perfect and the property is really sweet but our neighbor.. 'I mean, it's one thing' 'to live next to a stubborn, messy surfer' 'when you're single, but..' '...when you're a single parent with two young kids' then you can't have distractions day and night and I have a lot of work to do, so.. I'm sorry I'm rambling, but if you have anything can you let me know, please? Thanks. [instrumental music] [all cheering] Are you ready for the sandstorm? My feet won't even touch the ground. [whistle blows] [all cheering] - 'Yeah!' - Lucas! [Lucas] Hey there, you. Here. I made this for Tank. - What is it? - It's a collar. Well, you know, it's very decorative. It's not decorative. It's to help him stop pulling. Oh, okay. Now I see. Well, that is, it's very smart of you. I know. Nick helped too. And he hates crafts. [chuckles] Well, that's very sweet. Of the both of you. Oh, and it's also very pretty up close. Will you give it to him? You know what? He's gonna love this. [chuckles] Thank you. [instrumental music] Now, you can't tell me that you're not competitive. I see you runnin' around out there. It's not the same thing. We always race. Well, you should want to push yourself the same way here. - I do. - But then I need to see it. I thought we were done. You wanna improve your time, or what? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! [instrumental music] - What? - Nothin'. I'm just sayin'. Cute. Really cute. [chuckles] And no. [sighs] 'Alright, come on!' 'Now, reach for it.' One more time. Good form, come on! [music continues] [gasps] Did I get it? What's my time? You're early. I should probably, uh.. leave you guys to it. Yeah, it's probably a good idea. [Jenna] 'I mean, you gotta.. We tell each other everything.' [Nick] I know you don't like him. Maybe as a neighbor, but that's just it. He's a good coach, mom. I mean, he's not my coach, but he's been helping. That's not the point. And my time is improving. Slowly. I'm glad about that. I am. It's just-- I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. Let's talk about this more at home, okay? - Okay. - Alright. Come on, Ally, let's go. Grab your stuff, okay? [Jenna on machine] 'I mean, it's one thing' 'to live next to a stubborn, messy surfer' 'when you're single, but..' '...when you're a single parent with two young kids' 'you can't have distractions day and night' 'and I have a lot of work to do, so..' [knock at door] 'I'm sorry I'm rambling, but if you have anything' 'can you let me know, please?' 'Thanks.' Alright. I get why you're mad, I just don't see what being messy has to do with it. I'm sorry? Fine. You're right about one thing. I didn't s-say anything. We should've told you that we were having lessons. I was just trying to help the poor kid out. I know. You know? That's why I'm here. Can I come in? Yeah. Of course. Thanks. What you got there? Uh, a little thank you. Don't let the color fool you. It's actually pretty good. Aw. You made me dessert. Heh! The kids picked out the flavor. I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate what you've been doing for Nick. I'm really not doing much. That's not what he said. Well, then he's being very generous. I'm just helpin' out where I can. - It's nothing. - Maybe. Or maybe you care a little bit more than you want anyone to know? Either way, I hope you enjoy the treats. [scoffs] Are you kidding? Rainbow-colored food is my favorite type of food. [chuckles] Okay, I guess they know you better than I do. [chuckles] So, you'll keep me in the loop? I will now. Great, thanks. Goodnight. Goodnight. [instrumental music] Well, I guess they're stayin'. Hm. I'm king of the mountains. You can't be king. Why? Because I'm a girl? No, because I'm king. - No, I'm king! - No, I'm king. - 'I'm king.' - 'I'm king.' - 'I'm king.' - Alright, you're both kings. Now, everybody in their seats. We're supposed to be there in ten minutes. [Lucas] 'Y'all wanna keep it down out here?' I am tryin' to sleep. It's five o'clock in the afternoon. I was kidding. It was a joke. Oh, were you pretending to be me? Ha ha. Very funny. I try. You guys heading to the concert in the park? If everybody will get in their seats, yes. Are you coming too? Every Thursday. Lucky. Why don't I drive you? You want us to ride in that? Mm-hmm. - Cool! - Cool! - Can we? Please? - Can we? Please? I mean, does the thing even have seatbelts? [laughing] [cheering] - This is awesome. - Okay, this is pretty cool. Not as bad as you thought? [chuckles] Oh, poor Tank. [Jenna] No, not bad at all. [Lucas] Whoo! [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] So, do you think you might have time for another lesson? Under one condition. No hugging. I don't get it. Why would I.. - Hi. - Hi, Kayla. - Oh, how are you? - Good, how are you? Will you do me a favor? Will you take Tank? - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah, thank you. - I'll catch you in a bit, okay? - Oh, that's okay. - Hey, guys. - Hey. [Maureen] For being so punctual you're real late. I'm sorry, we decided to ride share. You decided to what? Oh, right! - Hey, neighbor. - Hey! - You surprised to see me? - 'Maybe.' So, does this mean we're making more room? - Or building a wall? - Ha ha ha. Uh, makin' more room. Right, Lucas? Actually, I think Lucas is meeting his girlfriend. - So, we should just-- - My what? Your girlfriend? Who's that? Oh, Kayla! [Lucas] 'Oh, no, no, she's, um ..' Oh, we've known each other for years. She's like a little sister to me. [Maureen] So, she's not your girlfriend? [Lucas] 'No, she's definitely' 'not my girlfriend.' She's just a, a good friend that I happen to employ. What do you mean employ? At the summer camp? Yeah, well, technically, you can call it mysummer camp 'but I've never been one for..' '...job titles.' Oh, you are definitely joining us. - Well, alright. Absolutely. - Thank you. [laughs] [Lucas] Yeah, I feel pretty lucky. I mean, to be able to, uh.. make a living doing this. [Maureen] So, you own the summer camp? That's why you're always there? Well, I also like the free food at the snack bar. So, there's that. [laughs] You really did the whole corporate thing? Yeah. For a while. To save up some money for the camp. Luckily I made some good investments. I can't believe it. I'm shocked. What part? That I own the place? Or that I actually have a schedule? Nick mentioned that? He sure did. [Maureen] 'Kids are like parrots.' They repeat everything you say. - Oh, oh, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, I mean, he must have taken it out of context. Hey, it's not a big deal. I would've assumed that I was unemployed too. [chuckles] You're funny. How's that? I don't know. Just...can't figure you out. What can I say? I'm full of surprises. [chuckles] [instrumental music] [Nick chuckles] You see, he's not such a bad guy once you get to know him. - Oh, hi. - Hi. No, I didn't think he was a bad guy. No? Uh, alright, I wasn't a huge fan at first but he's been really amazing to my kids. So, there you go. [Tank barks] I actually thought you two were together. Oh! Please, I'm so not his type. And he's not mine. - Really? - Yeah. 'Cause I think you're everybody's type. We're just friends. Well, that's good. I mean, either way it would have been good but...good. [exhales] [chuckles] - A cone. - Oh. Yes. Hi, um, can I get the lemon sherbet, please? Can I just give you a friendly warning? That sounds ominous. He's a sweet guy, for sure. But a family man, he is not. He likes his freedom way too much. Well, then I.. ...guess it's alright that I'm not looking for anything. You sure about that? Yeah, and I've already been disappointed by one relationship. - I'm not trying for another. - Hmm. - Your sherbet is ready. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Hi. A.. ...how about two vanillas and one strawberry sorbet? [seagulls squawking] I probably shouldn't ask this, but.. ...why are we here and not at the pool? You see that out there? Yeah, the old lighthouse? Yeah, well, that old lighthouse is how I get over my fear of swimming. Oh, please! You were never afraid. You're right. I was terrified. - Of what? - The open water. And that's not so great, if all you wanna do is surf. So, I told myself if I could swim out to that old lighthouse and back again, I'd just drop this whole scared stuff. How old were you? I don't know. Probably about your age. Oh, great, so now, you want meto swim out there too? To improve my time? No, definitely not. In hindsight, it wasn't the most logical plan. Look.. I'm not worried about your swim trials. I know you're gonna hit your time. All I'm trying to say is it's pretty amazing how strong you can be if you're pushed to it. Even if to push yourself. Wow. That was kinda deep. Well, don't get used to it, kid. Deep is boring. - You hungry? - Yeah, sure. I'll race you to lunch. - Okay. - Alright. [crickets chirping] [instrumental music] [sighs] Okay. I prefer this blue than the other blue if we're gonna go with the blue for food. Yeah, yeah, it's just that-- Are you really having a party on a Tuesday? Are we really being that loud? Look, I don't mean to be a killjoy, but.. It's nice to see you. Look, don't. Don't try to charm your way out of this one. I won that bet fair and square. Oh, so, you think I'm charming? What, what? No. You sure? Stop trying to change the subject. It isn't a party. No? Like, what is it? Uh, a hangout? We're working. - You're working? - Well.. ...that guy over in the corner isn't. [Lucas] 'But everyone else is.' We just wrapped a little promotional video. [Fred] 'It's not little.' Somebody wants to franchise the summer camp. Someone wants to invest? Like a Shark Tank guy? Actually, an old classmate of mine from Berkeley. And he comes down next week, so it is crunch time. [laughs] Wait, you went to UC Berkeley? Just for my MBA. [sighs] Hence, the two-week rule. What's that? Nothing. You're obviously busy. So, I'm gonna get going. Jenna? Yes. We'll keep it down. Thank you. You really are full of surprises. [instrumental music] Hey, did you guys remember your socks? Can't fall without 'em. Don't want foot fungus. Well, yeah, I think we get the idea, but.. [chuckles] Have fun. Happy birthday, Grayson. - Thanks, Mrs. T. - Yeah. You better relax tonight. It's your one night off. - I will. - You promise? - I swear. - Okay. Drive safe. [engine starts] Oh, come on. Really? [Tank barks] [Tank barks] [Lucas] 'Tank, come eat.' Hello? Lucas? [instrumental music] I'm sorry. Can barely hear you over that wall. Ha ha. Never gets old, does it? No. I was wondering, if maybe I could use your barbeque. I just have this one thing. Where are the kids? - Birthday party. - Oh, lucky you. Yeah. You don't outsource much, do you? Not usually, no. It's actually kinda nice to have the night off. And, uh, that's what you're eating? I was gonna put cheese on it. [exhales] That is pitiful. Grab your cardigan. Why? You takin' me out? Maybe. It's not that bad. [Lucas] This place never gets old. Even with all the crazy tourists, I just love it here. I can't believe you've been coming here for four years and you've never been to Sam's. - Not that I remember. - Oh, no, you'd remember. This is the best food you're gonna have in town. Ain't that right, Sam? - 'Luke!' - Haha. - How's it going? - Good, if you're hungry. We got an early bite. This is as fresh as it gets. What are you feeling like? Um, I don't know. - I eat everything. - Oh, a girl after my own heart. Well, except for cucumbers. People say they don't taste like anything but they totally permeate even if it just touches a leaf. If you're trying to make me revise my previous statement it's not gonna work. Then, I eat everything. [chuckles] How about you give us a whole crab, some of your garlic shrimp uh, two rolls and a stack of napkins. - Comin' up. - Thank you. [instrumental music] I bet you bring all your neighbors here. [laughs] Only the impossible ones. Oh. I'm flattered. [Jenna] I've run through, like, 50 napkins and you haven't even used one. Okay, so, the trick is you need to know how to grab the crab. See, first.. ...you take up all the legs and you hope you get some meat. No luck, no dice. And then.. Oh, this is a male. - And they.. Heh. Sorry. - Ugh! [laughs] I think I need another napkin. You can have the whole stack. [laughs] [Jenna groans] When did you suddenly become the neat one? See, now you sound like Ally. She just says it like it is. It's pretty impressive. Yeah, she really likes you. They both do. Well, they have impeccable taste. [laughs] Uh, okay, I, you know what? I think I'm done with this guy, but it was delicious. Best in town. Yeah. [sighs] You ready for your big meeting? Yeah. I think as long as I get a good surf in beforehand, I'll be fine. You have a tie? Do I need a tie? You said they're pretty corporate. I'm not worried. Are you always this relaxed? As long as I've done the best that I can on my end then just let the rest go. Yeah, I wish I could do that. Let things go? Stop trying to control things from all sides. Well, you got a few more sides to deal with than I do. Hm. Heh. And you're killing it, by the way. Killing it? - You think so? - Yeah. 'Cause I don't even have an ending for my book. Isn't that normal for writers? I don't know. It's only my second novel. I mean.. What if I only have one good one in me? Hey, don't sell yourself short. Look at everything you're doing. You're working from home you're raising two kids. Their dad is actually really helpful when he's not traveling. You guys still friends? Friendship was never really our problem. We just had very... different views on life. I wish I'd figured that out sooner. Then we wouldn't be here. Yes. This is...very true. [chuckles] Don't worry. I got a feeling that your sequel's gonna be even better than your first. [instrumental music] Here. Oh, it's fine. - I'm fine. - I know you're fine. I'd still like to give it to you if that's okay. Okay. [instrumental music] - Thanks. - Yeah. Well...this is me. Looks like your neighbor's a real slob. Yeah, well, it's his dog. He's really well behaved, o there's that. [laughs] Oh, uh, thanks for this. - Oh, yeah. - And for tonight. - It was fun. - Yeah, it was. I guess, I'll see you tomorrow. Yes, yes, you will. You will see me tomorrow. Not that you have much of a choice. True. [laughs] Okay. Okay, well, um, goodnight. Goodnight. [laughs] Okay. Bye. Bye. Goodnight. Goodnight. [instrumental music] Huh! [sighs] [instrumental music] [knock at door] Leash, please. [Lucas] Come on. Wait. Where are you going? Well, I thought I'd tag along today. If that's alright with you? Are you kidding? Yes. Here you go. - Lead the way. - Hmm. Awesome. You mind tellin' me where we're goin'? Right here. Sit down. It's his favorite spot. Okay. It took him a while to warm up. [sighs] Well, he's not really a morning dog. Or a trick dog for that matter. Sit. Shake. High five! [giggles] That's amazing. See, he just didn't know what he was missing. [Ally] Huh. Come, Tank. Huh. So, I told him no hot tub until he finishes the porch. You think that'll work? The man wants a hot tub. So, you're buying a gift for Lucas, from the kids? Yeah, the kids want to get him something for good luck since he's coming over for dinner. Wait. What? When? Tonight. I can't believe we've been hanging for over an one hour and you're just telling me this now. It's not a big deal. Hello, you've barely dated since your divorce. Yeah, well, I've been a little busy. - For the last four years? - Yeah. It's okay to feel excited. Alright, fine. I mean.. If it makes you feel more comfortable it's not a big deal. Thank you. But you still need a new dress. [gasps] What about this one? What's wrong with what I'm wearing? You can't wear khakis on a date. It's not a date. It's dinner with the kids. Tomato tomahto. Can I help you find a size? - Yes. - No. Just try it on. Please? Fine. But it's not a date. No, of course not. [whispers] It's a date. [giggles] [instrumental music] Wow. You look different. [scoffs] You look incredible. Thanks. Come in. Oh! These are for you. Thank you. [giggles] It's totally a date. So, what have we got here? We got some arugula, some figs and, uh.. ...chocolate chips. [Ally] Yes, they are. Ally insisted on making the salad. I see. Well.. ...it is delicious. So.. ...we have prepared a list of questions. - For who? Me? - You did? Mm-hmm. Question number one. Where did you grow up? Oh, this is relaxing. Arroyo Grande. Okay, my turn. Who taught you how to surf? - The VCR. - Hm. What's that? Proof that I'm a lot older than you. Okay, next question. Oh, this one's mine. What do you like best about our mom? Okay, no. You don't have to answer that. More salad? What do I like best? First thing that comes to mind. - You don't have to answer that. - That she.. ...is full of surprises. [laughing] Could I have some more water? Absolutely. [laughing] What're you laughing at? This salad is great, by the way. Thank you. [cheering on TV] So, what do we think? - It was awesome. - It was awesome. [laughs] How much did you pay them to say that? You should feel proud. It's really good. Here. The kids got you something. What? You guys are crazy. Open it. I don't know what to say. It's for good luck. Well, you could say thank you. Now you have a tie for your meeting. You didn't have to, but thank you. Thank you very much. Oh. Okay, you know what? Uh, I gotta get going. He's not a big hugger. Yeah, I want to get up early and get a.. ...a good surf in before the meeting. You know to de-stress. Yeah. You're gonna do great. Well, it's a big day for everyone tomorrow. Nick has his swim trial. Number we need for you to make swim team at school? One eighteen. - Vote for 118, remember? - Of course I remember. So, you'll be there? I'm gonna try my hardest. 'Cause I always do better when-- Okay, you know what? I will, I will be there. I promise. Okay. And on that note, goodnight. Thank you so much for dinner, the salad was delicious. - I had a really nice time. - Yeah, me too. Thank you. - Thanks for coming. Goodnight. - Goodnight. [instrumental music] Stop looking at me like that. [instrumental music] [Tank barks] I know what you're thinking. No, this does not mean we're going to Disneyland. Alright! Come eat! I want you to get all your major food groups in before your test. You need to stop worrying, mom. I'm ready. I know you are. I just want you to feel good. Full of energy. - You look happy. - I'm always happy, bud. Yeah, but...you look extra happy today. Well, I finished my draft last night, so.. - I don't think that's it. - No? - I think our neighbor-- - Okay, mister. No time for speculation. Eat. [Tank barking] I'll be back soon, buddy. [car door opens and shuts] [Tank barking] [engine cranking] Ally, breakfast! [instrumental music] [Kayla] Alright, guys, have fun out there. Alright, Nick, you're up next. Let's see if you can beat your personal best. Have you seen Lucas? Umm, I'm sure he's on his way. Light up. [indistinct chatter] So leave the promotional piece as it is and just.. ...run it with it from there. Hey, I am open to anything. As long as the integrity of the camp stays the same. Well, I think we need to go out and celebrate. Start talking expansion plans. [cell phone vibrating] I'd love to, but I can't. You have a wife and kids waiting for you? - You know that's not the case. - What then? You've worked hard. You're right. I have. Ten years in the making. I can't believe this is a go. Let's start planning. [clears throat] [cell phone vibrating] [whistle blows] [crowd cheering] Go, Nick. Go, Nick. Go.. [crowd cheering] Come on, come on, come on. [crowd cheering] [instrumental music] Hey, Nick. There was a lot of drag in the pool. - I felt it. - You don't need to say that. - You want a soda? - I don't want anything. - Nice job, Grayson. - Thanks, Mrs. T. Hey. You did good, bud. Real close. You should feel proud. Can you stop saying that? I just didn't want you to beat yourself up. Then stop talking about it, okay? Okay. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened out there. It's not your fault. I'm surprised Lucas missed it. - Are you really? - This time, yes. [knock at door] I've got it. [chuckles] Hey, buddy. I'm sorry, I missed you earlier. That's fine. - Is your mom home? - Yeah, I'll go get her. I'm glad your meeting went well. Thank you. But you can't do that. Yes, you are absolutely right. I probably should've gotten a dog sitter. I didn't know how long it was gonna take. This isn't about Tank. You can't make promises to kids that you can't keep. - I thought Nick had it. - But he didn't. And that's my fault? It threw him. See, now, this is why I stay unattached. Responsibility? Hey, it keeps things simple. So, you just want to live the bachelor lifestyle forever. Never get close to anyone. You're one to talk. You literally built a wall in your backyard because you're too afraid to let people in. You cannot write people off like that. - This is not about me. - Yeah, it kinda is. It's about Nick. He needed your support. He's not a boy anymore, he's 11 years old. He can't rely on other people to push him. He needs to learn how to push himself. You know what, I am not gonna argue with you about this. - Fine. - You can go, if you want. [instrumental music] [sighs] Hmm. Hmm, coffee. Ally. Ally. Honey, where's your brother? Don't know. [sighs] He's not in his bed. He promised he'd be back. Be back? From where? Lucas! Alright, alright, it's too early for drama. What is Dorin's Cove? I don't understand why Nick would do this. He's never snuck out before. I'm sure he had his reasons. I mean, how does he even know about this place? What? - I brought him here. - You what? This part was really important to me when I was a kid. I thought maybe it would help. How could this possibly-- I just wanted to give him some encouragement. I can't believe you. I can't believe that you would do this. I'm sorry. [Jenna sighs] [instrumental music] There's his bike. Well, then, he's gotta be down there. Stay here, sweetie. Okay. He'll be okay, he's a strong swimmer. [Jenna] 'Nick!' - 'Nick!' - Oh. That's my mom. Nick. Nick. Are you okay? Honey, are you okay? - Yeah. - What were you thinking? I thought I would get home before you noticed. Do you have any idea how many things are wrong with that statement? - You don't get it. - You're right, I don't. Do you have any idea how dangerous that was? I want you to go stand up there next to your bike with your sister and wait for me. We're gonna talk about this on the walk home. Why can't we go back with Lucas? Sorry, bud. I got a few things I need to take care of. Like what? I'm actually leaving tomorrow. I got to scout some locations for camps. Go on. I'll meet you up there in a minute. Alright. Look, this is my fault. I should've trusted my gut. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Doesn't matter anymore. Really? It does. I mean, look at you. No, I'm fine. Remember? You were right. Furry kids are the only kind you should handle. [instrumental music] [cricket chirping] Do you really think they'll like them? Double fudge cupcakes for the last day of camp? Who wouldn't? Alright. You finish the sprinkles. I'm gonna go talk to your brother, alright? [instrumental music] Hey, can we talk? Sure. So, you want to tell me what happened this morning? I told you, I just wanted to surprise you. By sneaking out? That's not a good surprise. - I didn't mean to scare you. - I know. But you did. I.. I'm sorry. It's just.. I wanted to do it then tell you so you didn't have to worry. [sighs] Honey, that's the beauty of being a mom. I'm always gonna worry about you. Both of you for the rest of my life. I'm just trying to understand what you did. I had to prove I could. To whom? Lucas? Myself. I don't want to be afraid of failure anymore. I get it. I really do. How do you feel now? Like, I did my best. Like, maybe that's enough. - Sounds stupid, right? - No. But it does sound a lot like somebody we both know. It's not his fault, mom. Lucas didn't tell me to do it. [Jenna sighs] I'm sorry, bud, but I don't wanna talk about our neighbor anymore, okay? But he leaves tomorrow. Well, then I guess we only have one more day to get through. Come on, let's go get a cupcake before your sister eats them all. [birds chirping] [sighs] Hey, mom, can we go outside and play for a bit? You need to get ready for camp. But...we already are. Oh. Oh. I'm proud of you both for getting yourselves ready but, no, not today. Pancakes are almost ready. So quiet, buddy. You gonna talk to me? [whimpering] [sighs] What you thinkin'? It's gonna be alright. Change of scenery will do us good. So, we've got absolutely no agenda today. I want you to go out there and play hard. Yes, Ally? Since it's the last day can we get half off in the end? Yes. [all scream] We could, um, caravan or get lunch or talk? Alright, stop. Okay, you need to vent or talk plans or do something normally 'cause you're freaking me out with all this silence. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, just talk to me. I don't know what to say. It's okay to feel disappointed. - I liked him too. - It's not about Lucas. No? Then what is this about? Maybe you should just talk to him. It might make you feel better. I think we've already said way too much. We're leaving tomorrow. It's better this way. It's certainly safer. Do you mind if we pick up the pace a little? I just want to keep moving. Sure. [instrumental music] [Jenna] The car is already filled to the brim. I mean, I don't understand where all this stuff came from? I'm sure we didn't bring this much. Well, I'm almost done with my stuff. Ally, not so much. What did I do now? Nothin'. You just look so grown up. Even in these last five weeks. Are you seriously crying right now? What? No. I just have overactive tear ducts. Right. You do look grown up though. Yeah, I've kinda learned a lot this summer. Yeah? Like what? Like, chocolate doesn't go with everything. Very true. Bunk beds are super uncomfortable. Oh, I totally agree. And.. And? You miss one hundred percent of the shots you never take. - Who told you that? - Lucas. See, this was a very grown up conversation. Go finish packing. [instrumental music] [Jenna] 'Nick.' I think I need to talk to him. - You do? - Yeah, I think so. Then go. Like, now. [engine cranking] Lucas! Lucas, wait! Stop! Lucas! Stop! Come on. I was like two feet away. You talking to yourself down there? 'Cause if you are we might need to find you some more friends. [chuckles] You're still here. Yeah. There was a...change of plans. Good. I mean, hi. This is good, because.. [exhales] I wanted to tell you I'm sorry. You did? For lashing out. You've been amazing with my kids all summer. Okay, maybe not when we first got here, but mostly amazing.. Thank you. I think. I was wrong about you. [Lucas] You were? Maybe I wanted to be right. But you were just kind of.. Great? Kinda. So, you don't think that I'm a stubborn, messy surfer who's totally distracted? Oh, you're absolutely stubborn, and.. Wait. How are you quoting.. The message that you left at the rental agency. You're L.M. Management. And you own the duplex. Hey, summer camp isn't a year round gig. I need to diversify. [sighs] I'm really glad that you stayed. I didn't mean all those things I said. Maybe I did when I first said it, but.. ...I was wrong. I was too. You were? I was wrong to think that I could stay unattached to the three of you. Why do you think I'm still hanging around here? You got me. What about your trip? Oh, don't worry about that. I'll catch up. I just couldn't miss you. I love you. - Are you crying? - No. Why does everybody keep saying that? Come here. I'm not crying. [Lucas] I know. What are we gonna do? About all this? About us. Well.. First, I think we need to set some.. ...new rules. You know, guidelines. Oh. And what would those guidelines look like exactly? Rule number one, I definitely get to kiss you. - Like, right now? - Preferably. I'm willing to agree to that. [instrumental music] Now, I got one more rule that needs to be addressed. [Ally] So, there are no sides anymore? [Lucas] You are free to roam. Does that mean Tank can come over whenever he wants? Only if I can come over with him. Hey, bud .. I'm sorry I let you down. - That was my bad. - That's okay. No, it isn't, but, uh.. I promise to make it up to you. - I'd like that. - Yeah? Yeah. You realize we're hugging, right? Yup. And we're good. Alright, throw it in. [laughing] [Nick] I'll beat you. - Nicky. - I beat you. - Come on, Tank. - Come here, boy. Come here. I don't want this summer to end. Doesn't have to. Yeah, it kinda does. We have to move back tomorrow. What if your rental agent said you could stay longer? [chuckles] That's sweet, but logistically.. We will make a plan. You really think we can make this work? We made the last five weeks work, we can make this work. Now, I have one more question for you. Okay. Can we go back to rule number one? Yes, please. [instrumental music] [instrumental music]
