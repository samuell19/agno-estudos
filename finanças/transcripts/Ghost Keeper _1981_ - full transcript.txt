(intense music) (high pitched radar sound) (unsettling music) (snowmobile revving) - There's one over there. (snowmobile revving) (dog barking in background) - You sure? (upbeat country song playing in background) - Yeah, some ... some authentic country rustic. Howdy, boss. When's the ... when's the whittling start? I thought these places always had old railroad guys sitting around the stove whittling wood. - Can I help you folks? - We just came in to warm up and look around a little bit. - We got coffee on top of the stove. - Thank you. - Seems a little quiet around here. Figured you'd be off to Lauderdale. - [Clerk] I don't know where it is, sonny. - It's Florida. Warm weather and no snow. - I like the snow. (chuckles) - You don't know what you're missing. Sandy beaches, Disney World, lots of bikinis, eh? Know what fills them bikinis, eh? - Yeah, I remember that. - What, bikinis? - Them Disney moving pictures. Ranger used to play one of them up here every summer. I saw The Living Desert three times. - Looks like you met your match, Marty. - Yeah, I think you're right. (snowmobile revving) (train in distant background) (closes door) - Well, you two have been hiding. - We're not really hiding, Chrissy. Just trying to get away from the noise of the lodge. - It's so boring back at the lodge. Some people are getting ready for the party tonight. Others are just sleeping. Or something. - Where's your date? - He is boring. I think he's washing the glaciers melt. (sighs) You know, I should learn never to go places with geological engineers. You professional people are always so preoccupied. - Hey, hey, hey, not all of us. - Hm. It's quite an interesting place, and I'll bet it's been here for years, just like this. There must be lots of interesting places to explore around here. - You best stay with the roads. These mountains can be tricky. - We can handle ourselves. - Mountains can fool you. They're dangerous. - How can mountains be dangerous? They're so beautiful. - Look, gramps, we're not gonna get lost. - There are worse things out there than getting lost. - I'm getting bored again. Think I'll do some more exploring. - I'd be heading back. There's a storm brewing out there. - [Chrissy] Come on. Where's your spirit of adventure? - Coming? - Thanks for the coffee. - You take it easy out there, miss. (suspenseful music) - [Jenny] One ... - [Marty] Two ... (snowmobiles revving) - Ready? - [Chrissy] Okay, let's go! - [Marty] The road we passed back a bit! Might be interesting! (snowmobiles revving) (snowmobiles revving in distant background) (snowmobiles' revving growing louder) (snowmobiles idling) - What do you think? - Probably an old logging road, or maybe just a cut line! - Well let's find out where it goes to. There might be an old camp or something! - The sign says "Keep Out," Marty. - Don't worry about it! There's probably been nobody up there since the last snowfall. - Do you wanna try it? - Yeah! - Come on! - Look, it's getting late. The storekeeper said to be careful. - Are you scared of getting lost? - I'm not scared, Chrissy. I just don't like going where signs say "Keep Out." Must be there for a reason. - Oh, since when did you play by the rules? - Hey, girls, girls, come on. Let's give it a try! (snowmobiles revving) (suspenseful music) (snowmobiles revving) (suspenseful music intensifies) (snowmobiles idle) - Incredible, eh? Up here all by itself. (suspenseful music) - Marty, I don't like this place. Let's leave. - Oh, don't worry about it. - There's no tracks. Nobody's around. - Snow's really coming down, now. Let's leave before it covers our tracks. - Relax, we'll get back, we'll get back. (snowmobile revving) (Chrissy laughs and cheers) (crash) (Chrissy yells) (snowmobile idling) - Here. Come on, beauty. Up on your feet. - Am I okay? - Except for the crooked nose, the two teeth that are missing, and the scar on the left side- - Seriously! - You okay, Chrissy? - Am I okay? - [Marty] You're okay. (Chrissy huffs) (snowmobile trying to start) - Here, let me do that. (snowmobile trying to start) Well, it's cinch all three of us can't go on that one. (suspenseful music) Safari time, ladies! (Chrissy laughs) (suspenseful music) - How you doing? (all panting) (suspenseful music) - This is better than working out at the gym. (Chrissy laughs) (suspenseful music) - [Marty] Door's locked. - [Chrissy] Try to force it open. - Oh, here it goes. - [Chrissy] Give it a good shove! (suspenseful music intensifies) - [Chrissy] Well, what do we have here? (suspenseful music) - [Marty] Doesn't exactly look ready for the weekend crowd, does it? (wind howling outside) (suspenseful music) (music intensifies) (Marty shouts) (Chrissy screams) - (with fake English accent) And, where is the manager? - Reservation, ma'am? - Reservations, indeed. I am the Princess Marguerite. I have a standing reservation. - And your party? - Bringing in my luggage. I shall stay for one month, and one must bring so much when one comes to these remote parts of civilization. Oh, I shall miss Monte Carlo for Christmas. - Hey, according to this, nobody's checked in in nearly five years. - (sighs) That's why I can never find a porter in this place. - Then, why's it warm in here? - Well, probably means somebody's here. I mean, furnaces don't start by themselves, do they? Look, it's going to quit snowing pretty soon, and we'll be outta here pretty quick, so let's just get comfortable. - [Jenny] Where are you going? - Just thought I'd look around. (suspenseful music) - Well, here we are, just the three of us. A party and nowhere to go. (suspenseful music) (music intensifies) (cat mews) (Jenny screams) (door opening) (Jenny screams) (suspenseful music) (piano keys tinkling) (begins playing piano) ♪ I found a man ♪ He was my love ♪ He took my ... (stops playing, continues to hum) (wind howling) (suspenseful music) - Looks like we aren't going anywhere for now. Guess I should tell the girls we'd best sign in for the night. (suspenseful music intensifies) (music intensifies) (door thudding) (music intensifies) (wind whistling) - Jenny... (music intensifies) (Marty humming) ♪ My sister, Lucinda ♪ She peaks out the window ♪ And into my big sombrero ♪ Into my drinking water ♪ And onto my baking soda ♪ (Both singing) Ay ay ay ay ♪ I am Francisco Bandito ♪ I steal them and rob them ♪ And rape them and screw them ♪ And then I peaks out the window ♪ - (chuckles) You're terrible. - You still with us? - I was just wondering if anybody back at the lodge is looking for us. - You don't have to worry about that. They're probably too drunk to notice anyone missing. Besides, I don't mind this. It's the first quiet New Year's I've had in ages. - Come on, Jen. Don't worry about the others. - I think there's somebody else here. - Where, in this room? - In this place. - Oh, you mean like a vampire or something? - Before, I was in a room upstairs, and I felt somebody else was there. - Well, maybe it was one of us. - No. It was somebody or something else. - You've got a good imagination. That's all. You know, I've got a good imagination. Marty, have you ever told anybody a deep, dark secret about yourself? - Like, having VD or something? - No. I mean, something that you've never told anybody about yourself. Something that you've hidden away for years. - You go first. - (chuckles) Well, once when I was 16, I had this uncontrollable urge to wanna do it for money. You know, like being a hooker. - Um hmm. - I was in Grade 10, and we had this substitute teacher in just for the day. He was ... he was one of those scholarly types, about 40 or so. Now, I was walking home, it was raining, and he came by in his car and offered me a ride. So I got in, we took off. I was just soaked. My shirt clung to my breasts, cold and wet. God, it was like my heart wouldn't stop pounding. I just ... I had to have somebody right then and there. It wasn't the first time for me, and I know what men like, so I took his hand, and I slid it up my leg. Well, he looked at me and jerked his hand away really quick. So I just smiled at him. (chuckles) I think he nearly drove off the road, but he stopped on the side street, and he started kissing me like crazy. I pushed him back, and I said, "If you really want it, you'll have to pay me $100." This guy was so hot by this time that he would have given me $1000 if he'd had it. He reached inside his coat and took out this envelope. It was his pay for subbing that day, $40. And he said that that was it. That was all he had. - Well, did you take it? - All of it. And then we did it in the back seat. Twice. (chuckles) I don't know what made me tell you that. I've never told anybody before. It's always been my private sexual fantasy. - The last of the grape. If I'd known we'd be guests here, I would have brought another bottle. Well, I wonder if there's a wine cellar in this place. - (sighs) ♪ Da da da da ♪ Ya ya ya ya ya (chuckles) (suspenseful music) (screams) (music intensifies) - [Jenny] Marty? Marty, what's wrong? (crash) - What the hell's going on in here? - I, uh, I think it's an old lady. - It's okay. We're not gonna hurt you. - Do you live here? - Is this your place? - Jenny, she's looking at you. Talk to her. - We're stranded here. We broke in so we wouldn't freeze. - Careful, babe. She bites. - No, it's okay. She's just scared. - You can't stay here. You gotta go, now. - She talks. - We can't go anywhere until tomorrow. - Look, really, we're three polar bears, and we'd prefer to be out in the snow tonight. It's just, we thought we'd come inside and rough it a little bit, if it's all the same to you. - You're not allowed here. This place is closed. - Then what are you doing here? - I ask the questions, girlie. - Listen, we have nowhere to go. And I'm not going out there in the dark. Especially when it's snowing and about 40 below. - You're a tough one, cookie. - My name's Jenny. - Jenny. (suspenseful music) You think this is cold, you oughta seen it in '55. Winters so cold, the branches cracked off the trees, sounded like rifles going off. My store-bought whiskey froze right in the bottle. (laughs) - You been living here a long time? - Lived here all my life. - You ... you work in this joint? Are you a caretaker? Baker or Indian chief? First word, three syllables, sound like- - City folks always asking questions, always gotta know everything. I went to the city once when I was a kid. Couldn't breathe. Too many people, everybody running around going nowhere. Mountains. Mountains is made for living. - You live here all alone? - No one's ever alone in the mountains here. - You're just ... You just don't like answering questions, do you? - And you don't like not asking them. Nobody ever comes up here anymore. Hotel's been closed for a while. - [Marty] Five years. - It's not that we're trying to be noisy or anything, it's just that it seems so strange, you being here all alone and everything. - I ain't alone. - Who else is here? - My boy is here. And the mountains. They keep me company. - [Marty] What do you mean your boy? Where's he? - [Old Woman] Oh, he's around somewhere. Never off too far. - Well, looks like we might just have a good New Year's party after all. (suspenseful music) (wolves howling in distance) - Hotel ain't changed much. Most of the rooms still like they was, bedding's still in. - It's much cooler up here. - I keep the second floor heated, and some of the rooms downstairs. Heat won't stay. Gotta lot of cracks here. - Why'd the hotel close? - No business. (door creaks) - [Chrissy] They're not locked? - No reason to lock 'em. Nobody here you wanna keep out. - You gotta point there. - Here's your room. I got another one for you two down the hall here. The plumbing's out in the rooms, but there's a bathroom down the hall. And some hot water, not a lot. - [Chrissy] Well, it's not exactly the Ritz, but it'll do. Maybe the bed's snuggily. 'Night. (door creaks closed) - Do you wanna sleep with her? - It's not like you own me or something, you know? - I didn't say that. - You implied it. What is it with you, anyway? I mean, how come you always wanna start something all the time? - I'm sorry. I don't know why I get like that. - I mean, I gotta right to live my life the way I want, and I thought we had that all settled in the beginning. - What about me? - Well, you live it the way you want. Just remember who pays the bills, that's all. You... you got nothing to say about that, do ya? And you like to ... you like to spend money and all that stuff. I never hear you complain about that, do I? - You know, Marty, sometimes you can be a real bastard. - Thank you. Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom and wash up. - [Jenny] Can't you just say where you're going? - Sure. Sure, I'd be glad to. I'm gonna go down the hall to the bathroom. I'm gonna turn the right tap on with my left hand- - You never tell me. You never do, whenever you sleep with somebody else. You're not even man enough to admit it. - You're crazy. - Don't you call me that. Don't you ever call me that. - You know what it is about you? I figured it out the other day. You're scared of flipping out, just like your old lady. - Bastard. - [Chrissy] Hi. - [Marty] Hi. - I was just gonna to take a bath. (suspenseful music) (water running) (suspenseful music) (door creaking open) (door shutting softly) (loud drum roll) (brief scream) (music intensifies) - Chrissy? Chrissy? - You're up late, missy. Thought you'd be asleep by now? - I heard noises. - This old place is full of noises, especially when it's cold, it sounds like a shot moose. It's an old lady, just like me. - You never did say what you do here. - I look after things. - What about your son? - Oh, he's around here somewhere. He had some work to do. He ain't much for socializing. - I guess you don't get much company up at these parts. We'll be leaving first thing in the morning. - You know, you're an okay one. You're tough inside. - What do you mean? - You gotta be tough to handle this job. You gotta be ready every minute, and I'm getting too old for it. - [Jenny] For what? - Hey, what's up? See Chrissy around? - [Jenny] No. (door slams shut) - She's probably out exploring or something. That kid never gets enough. Chrissy? (door creaks open) Chrissy? Chrissy, you there? Happy New Year, Marty. (heavy breathing) (intense, frightening music) (Chrissy whimpers, gags) - Did you find her? - No. - She'll show up. She always does. Marty, I'm sorry. We fight so much. I don't want to. Maybe I'm going through some kind of stage or something. Maybe it's insecurity. You know I'm afraid of being crazy. I don't wanna be like my mother. I live in fear of that. - You really jump on ... jump on me sometimes. - I guess I get mad. You don't have to call me those names. Maybe we should both try a little harder. - Do you want this relationship? - I don't know. It's too hard to think in this place. I don't know. - Good night. - Night. (suspenseful music) - [Disembodied Voice] Jenny ... Jenny. (suspenseful music) (door creaking open) (suspenseful music) - [Old Woman] Baby, you must be cold. I'll make you something hot. Some soup, some nice hot soup. You always liked that. (music intensifies) It's done, isn't it? You done good. It'll be fine. He needed us. You know that. He needed us. No, I'm not mad at you. (suspenseful music) (coughs) (snow crunching underfoot) (snowmobile failing to start) (soft suspenseful music) - Marty? Marty? (door slams) - Okay, what the hell's going on here. Hey! Yeah, you. I wanna know what's going on here. Where's Chrissy? And who's been playing with my machine? Chrissy, where is she? Her snowmobile's gone, and mine's been busted. - She's gone. - Where? - [Old Woman] I don't know. - There were no tracks out there. I mean, the snowmobile would have left some after the fresh snow. - I don't know where she's gone and didn't see her go. - Well, that doesn't answer the question about my machine, does it? It's been fooled with. - I don't know about them machines. I never used one. I can't help you. (knife slamming down) - Look, there's a shed outside. I'm gonna out and see if I can scratch something up. You stay here and babysit. - (chuckles) There's tea on the table. (soft, unsettling music) That ... boyfriend of yours sure gets riled, don't he? - Just his way. - Time's change. Used to be a man and woman couldn't spend a night together unless they was proper married. - Things are different now. You know more about Chrissy. You're not saying, but I know you know more. - Tea's nice and hot. Just what a body needs in the cold. - You know what I think? You don't even work for this place. You've made it yours, somehow, but you don't work here. - You think what you want. What's done done, you can't change it. - Last night I heard you talking to somebody else. We never see anybody else around. Where's Chrissy? Where's Chrissy? (unsettling music) - You better save your strength for when you need it. (music intensifies) (tool clatters) (suspenseful music) - Must be something around here I can use. (music intensifies) (cup clatters) (music grows louder) (gasps) (music intensifies) - [Marty] Damn. Spark plug wrench, I wouldn't know what to do if I tried. (suspenseful music) (cat meows) - [Jenny Voiceover] The flesh-eating giant could be kept by certain people, mostly females who had an ancient power handed from one to another. - Gotta get out of here. (music intensifies) - [Disembodied Voice] Jenny ... Jenny. (lock clicks) (giant moans) (screams) (chainsaw revs) (man yelling) (intense music) (Jenny screams) (fast-paced, intense music) (music slows) (music intensifies) (man screams) (Jenny breathes heavily) - Marty! Marty! Marty, we've gotta get out of here! We've gotta get out of here! There's a monster in there! - [Marty] What's going on here? - [Jenny] In the basement, I saw it! It called me, it called my name! It was the voice I heard before! - Where is he? - It's her son! He tried to kill me! I pushed him out! (gasping) He tried to kill me! - [Marty] You're dead? You're dead? You'll never get away with it. - Where are you going? Wait, Marty! Marty! (gasping) Marty! What's wrong with you? (gasping) Marty, you've gotta get out of here. Marty? - You killed him. You killed that guy. - Forget that now. It's over. Forget him. (explosion) (intense music) - [Old Woman] It's time, Jenny. Soon, you'll understand. - Marty. Marty! Marty, there's ... - It's alright. It's okay, it's okay. Chrissy, she's gone, eh? I gotta go find her. She ... she probably went back to the lodge, yeah? Yeah, that's what she did, eh? If my mom could see me now, eh? Her son a lawyer, outta control. My old man ... I never saw him lose control. All my life, I've never even seen him shout. Just once ... just once, I would love to see him get real mad, you know. Just ... just get unsure of himself. (Jenny whimpers) You killed that man. You shouldn't have done that, Jen. I gotta go get help. Yeah, you know, I'll go get help. You ... you stay here. All those years of college. The books with the big words. Now I ... I can't even fix a goddamn wire in a machine. (Jenny whimpers) Chrissy ... She's probably ... she's probably back at the lodge, eh? She's probably gone back to the lodge, yeah? - [Jenny] Please ... please listen. - It's okay. It's okay now. Gee. Funny thing is, you know, I never could defend a man who earned less than $75 grand. (suspenseful music) I don't know how the hell I'm ever gonna get outta here. - Marty. I know how. There's a gun. There's a gun! I saw a shotgun! In the closet! Marty? Marty! (intense music) (music intensifies) Ah! Where are you going, Marty! I found a gun! I found it in the closet! (low drum beat) Where are you going? Marty, don't! Marty, don't! (low drum beat) (sighs) (creepy music) (low drum beat) (wind whistling) (suspenseful music) - Hello! Hello, anyone home? (music intensifies) (man yells) (unsettling music) (window clatters open) (suspenseful music) - My baby. My baby. My baby. (breathing heavily) (intense music) (music intensifies) (items clattering) (gun clicking) (soft chimes) - My little girlie. Here you are. - Don't step any closer. It's loaded. - [Old Woman] Doesn't work. Never has. - You can't be sure of that. - [Old Woman] You wouldn't kill me. You couldn't kill me. That's something a crazy person would do, and you're not crazy, are you? - What do you know about that? - Oh, I know a lot of things. And you know who I am. - What are you talking about? - You don't want to be crazy, do you? Think of me. I'm a mother. Just a mother. - My mother's dead. - Is she? Or no? I'm your mother. Look at me! I'm you're mother! - No! - [Old Woman] Come to me, Jenny. - My mother's dead. - No, Jenny, I'm not dead. Come to mother. Come. I'm right here. It's okay. You don't need it for your mother. It'll be alright. Put the gun down, and come to mother. She won't hurt you. I won't hurt you! (gun fires) (suspenseful music) - [Disembodied Voice] Jenny ... Jenny ... Jenny. (frightening music) (door creaks open) (moans) - [Jenny] It's alright. Jenny will look after you, now. (door creaks closed) (chimes) Marty. Marty? You should have listened to Jenny. Should have been nicer to Jenny. (unsettling music) I have to go now. But don't worry, Marty. I'll be back for you. (unsettling music) (howling) (suspenseful music) (fire crackling) - [Old Woman's Voice] It's over, isn't it? You done good. You'll be fine. I'll look after you, you know I will. You'll see, Jenny. It'll be like it always was. You'll see. That's it. (suspenseful music music) (intense music) (high-pitched radar sound)
