Intense music clock ticking fast the sound of footsteps I was told it was going to be a few days before you came in because of the injuries... You sustained. So you made a house call... Unorthodox, I know but i thought it prudent to see you as soon as possible. Before details fade. So... Are you on any medication that may alter or perhaps... It wasn't a head injury. I'm fine. Everything you need to see is in the videos I sent. I would like you to help me build a clearer picture. I'd like to hear it from you. OK? Good. Lets Begin. How long have you been with the Bureau? Eight years... But you already know that because you have my file. Now I prefer we cut the bullshit now. There is no need for the baseline questions. What do you mean? You were given the task to see if I lost my shit out in the field. And if so... How much responsibility does the FBI need to shoulder. I am not here to investigate your level of responsibility in the incident. I am a behavioral analyst. I am here to try to understand you account of it. To say it was bizarre would be an understatement. A Profiler.... They think I'm insane. Frankly, their opinion does not matter at this point. I would like you to tell me what happened. You have my word, for what it's worth, that I will be fair. Well as you know, I was in the human trafficking division. Mainly on the "Stop-Gap" capacity on the border patrol. After the New Mexico situation, I was put on leave for six months. I started to get anxious to get back in the field. I found this case in northern California and beg ged my I.D. to let me do it. He agreed. What happened when you got there? Eerie music... A basketball bouncing... The sound of the ocean... Knocking on the door... Agent Erickson? Deputy Ross I assume. Please... Sorry we couldn' t greet you when you arrived. We thought your flight came in tomorrow. I was going to stay in San Fransisco another night but I decided to get a jump on things. Not a problem. How was the flight? Bumpy. Yes. That coastal air can be a bit choppy, Chief Duffy wanted to come but he's tide up with another missing persons case. There's another missing person? Why wasn't I informed? We only realized he was missing yesterday. That information should have come to me the moment it came to the station to be looked into. It's very scenic out there but I'm not here for the view. Im here to do a job. And to do said job, I need information in real time. OK... Give me the case details... You were very abrupt with her. Did you take issue with how she conducted herself as an officer? No... Have you had trouble in the past working with female colleagues? No, I was pissed. I don't have a problem with females. I have a problem with shoddy work. Lets go back. You said that when the Deputy arrived, you were informed that another person was missing. Correct, I was told that two men were out hunting the day before. Dave Aldrick. Forty years old. Prominent member of the community Went out hunting with his friend Steve Haberman. Steve says that Dave was acting irregularly by the end. Could Mr. Aldrick just have left? Taken a vacation? We thought of that but his keys, phone wallet... What about manic or suicidal tendencies? History of depression? No... You said he was acting irregular. Elaborate on that. Steve said he was rambling on about hearing music and whispering. You said the was no history of mental illness. Nothing in his past, no. It's getting pretty late. We should look to head back. What? We still have a good two or three hours before the sun goes down. We can't call quits now... Look man, I agreed to come hunt with you. I don't fucking hunt. I hate this shit. You were having a rough week, and... Alright alright... Jesus. Sorry I took you away from your precious Sunday football or whatever the fuck you do. Look Dave... Just head back to the truck and I'll be back in a second. Creepy music starts... Haunting music in the background The music intensifies.... A unhuman growl... The sound of a heat beat racing... When did you meet the Sheriff? He was in the field where the two men were hunting before. That was the first time I met him. Nature sounds and syncopated music... Here's our FBI agent. How is he? Got a little grouchy when I told him about Dave. Don't pay him any mind, Abby. This isn't my first time serving as a liaison for an FBI agent. These types all run the same. No personality, no respect. Don't worry. He'll poke around just long enough to say he did his job... And then he'll just leave. I don't know. He seems focused. Chief Duffy... Thank you for meeting us out here. I also want to follow up with you back at the station about a few case files. Well huh... I hate to disappoint you agent but we don't have a station per se. Excuse me? There's about 600 people in this area. Mostly native Americans who really don't want us around, let alone in a position of authority. What do you do with your prisoners? We ship them to county. As you know, we're all but cut off from civilization here. We're surrounded by miles of Redwood forests and the Pacific ocean. Our resources are limited. I understand. I wanna make sure that you do, Agent. Now I speak for the Deputy and myself when I say, We will extend to you, every resource available to us. Now I appreciate your help. We want to work in concert with you. But we insist that you extend that same courtesy to us as well. Of course. Now where was the missing person last seen hunting? What's this? What? Those scratches? Those are from deer. Deer? Yeah. Deer sometimes rub their antlers aginst trees in certain times of year. I don't know. These just seem deep to be deer antler. They're also concise. Straight down. To the side. Alright. Lets get out of here. I want to review the case file and any additional info that you do have. Miss Duffy, that was delicious. Thank you. Well you're very welcome. Now, just leave all the dishes. I'll get them in the morning. I know you guys have a lot of work to do and I need to check on my kiln. Goodnight. She makes ceramics. Is this your first time in Humboldt? Yeah. The drive was beautiful. I've lived here all my life and this place still blows me away. I did have a little trouble getting to the island off the coast, however. When did you try to get out there? When I first arrived. I thought I'd get an overview of the area. A lot of me research indicates that the incidents happen around those spots. That's uh, Indian Island. That territory is controlled by the local tribe. They really don't like outsiders poking around there too often. That would be a process you would have to go through. Have a special guide. It's something I can arrange if you really want to go. I would. All right then. But I should let you know something about the local folks before you do. They kind of have their own way of doing things around here. And if someone from the city or anywhere shows up, They know. And more often than not... They will be weary of you being here. You've lived here all your life. Are you weary of me being here? No. Maybe 30 years ago, But I've come to understand it. Why the locals feel the way they do. And why is that? Well... I could tell you... But I'd have to kill you... What can you tell me about Dave? Dave.... Dave's not the most interesting fellow around. And now it appears he's had a nervous breakdown and wandered off into the woods. You know there are drop offs that go all the way to the ocean out there. This really could be a run of unfortunate luck. Unfortunate luck? I don't think this is just bad luck. 2004... Jane Harper... 1993... Marisa Caputo, Jay Wynn, Darren Palmer, Roy Henry... All gone. Well... Except for Roy. His remains were found but looked like he was mauled by an animal. This goes back for decades. Six in 1980. Three in 1975. it all happens at once. Animal attacks and missing persons. It will keep going for a short period, then nothing. I don't think this is a coincidence. How did you get this info? Initially I didn't. The Bureau received several emails for a Howard Coffman. He said that we need to look into this. Howard sent you this information? Some of it, Yes. I put the others together when I realized there was a trend. Well... I guess I should let you know that Howard is not the most reliable of sources. Why is that? He had a nervous breakdown. It was a long time ago but it got pretty bad. He was violent for a few days. Well regardless. I'm gonna need to talk to him. He had enough sense to put this together so... I've got to know if he knows anymore. Alright... Alright... Well we can run over to meet him whenever you're ready. I appreciate that. A bouncing basketball I asked nice yesterday but today you're pissing me off. There is this whole area to play. Move on! This is the only level area. This is gravel. This isn't level. Why aren't you in school? Leave me alone, Pervert. Don't you know it's creepy for grown ups to talk to kids? Thanks Dick! Ocean Sounds... I saw this Howard Coffman name in the report. Tell me about him... I think most people would consider him insane. And you? If you would have asked me two weeks ago I would have said yes. But now, I'm not so sure. Maybe he is but, after the things he's seen... I can understand how he would be. -Knocking on the door... Howard I'd like to thank you for meeting us on such short notice. Who's this? Agent Erickson with the FBI. FBI... Don't much care for them. They never seem to care much for me... Sir, I just want to... So you've been reading the correspondences I sent in.... FINALLY. Yes we did. And I'd like to know if you have any additional information in regards to the case. If you know anything else about the other cases. Possibly a human trafficking ring? Trafficking ring? Do you really believe all these disappearances are part of any kind of fucking trafficking ring? I have several theories and that is one of them. Well that is stupid. Did you read anything I sent you? Frankly Howard, what you sent us is why I'm here. And so I'd like to see if you have any additional information so that I can better prepare. You can't prepare for what this is... What he told us was absurd. There was nothing rational about it. But I could tell he believed every word he said. And what was that? He described a picnic. He and his wife went on years before. At some point the dog ran for the tree line and he went after it. And was overcome by this... sound. He described it like a song. He lost his sense of awareness and ultimately lost control of himself. It haunted him. Made him do things. What did? He believed it was a creature. And this creature made him do things? What things? He beat his wife. And you believe this song he heard from the creature made him do that? I lost everything because of this. I lost my wife, I lost my life.. Don't you dare stand there... And tell me I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Agent... Something, not someone... is out there... ...Paper rustling... I believe... That this is it's home. It lives in that wood area. And it hunts... feeds... and sleeps. It's a cycle. Mr. Coffman, I understand that you went through something traumatic. And... We are all very appreciative of all the information you have given us so far. So we will definitely follow up with you if we have anything else. Agent I know... You think you've got this thing handled... But I assure you you don't. Thank you Mr. Coffman. I thought he was a fool. Where was the investigation heading from there? What the fuck is up with these sounds? I've been going over the case files and there are a lot of statements that indicate music or songs were heard or talked about. Have you guys not talked about this? It was ruled purely circumstantial.. There was no connection to the other cases. I want to get out to the woods tomorrow. Chief already contacted someone from the tribe. Good. Having someone that knows the area will be helpful. I wouldn't expect a warm welcome. Yeah, I'm well aware of that by now. Can I ask you a question? Yeah sure. I looked into your previous cases... And you're involved in that New Mexico case a few months back. You know what? It's getting late. You'd better be getting home and get some sleep. We have a big day tomorrow. Creepy music Oscar... Duffy... Abigail. This is agent Raleigh with the FBI. He is the one that wants to look around. Any place in particular that you wanted to start? Anywhere with caves or where an animal might make its den. If we had an individual doing this over years, they would need a place to keep victims. We'll make our way over to the north. What can you tell me about the attacks that have occurred on the island? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm sorry but are you not familiar? Let me make this very clear. I am not here to regale you with tales and legends of my people. I work at the gas station. The Sheriff offered me $200 bucks to show you around and I'll do that, but no bullshit stories, OK? OK... I'll take you where you want to go but Im not responsible for anything that happens. And we leave when I say. No questions asked. I understand... Alright... Lets make this quick and keep your eyes open. ...OMINOUS MUSIC... I want to check this out... We need to get outta here. It's gonna be dark soon. It's not safe. Music intensifies... My God... Dave... Can you hear me, Man? What happened to you? Is there anyone else out here with you? ...Grunting and fighting... Stop Dave!!! ...SINGLE GUNSHOT- ...THREE MORE GUNSHOTS... ...Heavy Breathing... Where is Oscar? ...HEAVY PANIC BREATHING... ...INTENSE MUSIC BUILDS UP... Oscar screams!! Oscar! OSCAR!! We need to get this man to a hospital now! Sheriff... NO. LISTEN. If we don't get him to a hospital now, he will die. And that's on you! Sad music plays quietly... Oscar didn't make it. What the hell happened out there? That was our missing person. I put three shots in him before he went down. I've only seen that when someone was on PCP or Meth. I mean, could he have been drugged? Did anyone see anything else? I don't know. He was beating the shit out of me. Oscar must have heard the fight, got scared and ran off. Oscar knew something bad was out there. That's why he was afraid. Howard was right. We weren't prepared for this. Oscar wouldn't talk about the attacks on the Island. What do you know? It's not something the locals like to talk about. In 1860... The tribe and the settlers were at odds. Some of the settlers cattle got on tribal land got slaughtered. The settlers organized a series of attacks that ultimately lead to a massacre. Women and children... Jesus... I huh... I think we all need some sleep. We can regroup in the morning... Why don't you guys just head home. The Deputy said Oscar knew something was out there. What do you know? What are you getting at, Agent? Why do I feel you aren't telling me everything? You know as much about this situation as I do right now. Bullshit! Enough. I just watched a gut get his throat ripped out. He was 6'1, 220 pounds, and he was terrified. Is that shit normal around here? Son... I'm tired. We need to regroup, in the morning, after we've both had some rest. And you need to go home... Now. Mr. Woodenhorse is a member of the Hoopa Tribe. We are actively trying to secure information about his death but The tribe is declining an autopsy, citing religious views. But... Pictures taken at the seen are consistent with a large wolf or bear attack. Both animals are prevalent in the region... so. What about the den? We found toys and clothes from 50 years ago. I'm not a zoologist, Agent. I don't know what it was. Lets come back to that shortly. The hunter that was found but... Dead. You claim... you shot him. Self defense. I had no choice. Was it done out of fear or necessity? There were witnesses. Neither of whom can testify on your behalf. I saw the Sheriff being attacked and the suspect came for me. I did not want to kill him. It took four shots to make him stop. And you feel that that was not excessive force? Under those circumstances, I am confident that I made the right decision. And... After what I had seen, I decided to go back and speak to howard. I know he didn't make a lot of sense but I thought that if I could... see between the lines, something would flush out. Tell me everything you know. I didn't see it... But I saw where he... it lives... There were bones everywhere. I'm guessing you surprised it. What do you mean? This thing has survived for decades... Centuries. It knows how to cover its tracks. It knows no one is going up there. It's smart. What is it? Ever hear of a Wendigo? No. It's an old Native American creature. The stories very but they end the same way. They say that when you eat something, you absorb its essence. The same holds true for humans. According to legend... When you eat a human, you absorb its strength, stamina. You become something more. Eventually you become something different altogether. And you think this is what's taking people? Yes. Or something very much like it. I know it's crazy but think about it. Its got strength, speed. It only has to hunt every 10 years or so. Everything I've read... It all says the same thing. What about the song? You said you heard... Hear a song. There is little about that. My theory is.... This creature only hunts... When it has to. It prefers to lure its prey in. We have all kinds of animals that lure their prey in. The Angler fish, the Margay, the Assassin Bug. Is it so far fetched to think that this thing could do something more? No. This is insane. Agent, this is real. We have to hunt it and we have to kill it. I can't believe I let myself believe this. We have to stop it! If... When this thing is done eating all that it needs to, it will go back into hibernation. Then in 10 years it starts again and I don't know if I've got another 10 years. Hey, it getting late. Aren't you gonna get some sleep? Just taking the edge off. I'm so sorry about Oscar. I knew him a long time. He could be grumpy but... He was a good man. It was my fault. Hey. You had no idea something was gonna happen. You're a good sister. I gotta poop. ...CREEPY MUSIC... Norman? NORMAN! What? Hey, turn the lights off before you go to bed. Yeah OK. OK? OK, OK... Goodnight. Night. ...Ominous background music... Fighting and grunting sounds... grunting screaming... According to your report... After you saw Howard, you went back to your cabin to sleep. That is correct. What happened? I hadn't sleep well for the third day in a row and had a lot on my mind. You mentioned a boy... It was nothing. You mentioned it. In your initial report. I was in shock. I understand, Sometimes... the most asinine or minut detail can shed more light than we would have imagined. Please... Tell me anyway. It was the 3rd morning in a row... and... This kid... maybe ten? He would stand outside my cabin and bounce this ball. And it would wake me up. So I'd... Open the door to yell at him and... he wasn't there. His bike tire was spinning like he was just there. But I looked around and there wasn't a soul in sight. You know those moments when everything is that quiet that makes more sound than you could ever imaging? That's how it was. I wandered around for a bit and found his jacket. Then I found him about 30 yards away. There wasn't much left. I just sat there. Agent? AGENT! Sorry. There is nothing mentioned in the report of the little boys death. That's because it didn't happen. It was just a dream. I never saw the kid. I woke up to my cell ringing... The Deputy was hysterical ...Ominous Music... What happened? We don't know much... The meter man saw her through the sliding glass door. She was strangled... He called it in but Norman was no where to be found. Oh Jesus... Agent? I know you didn't know norman that well but... he loved his sister and would never do anything to hurt her. Whatever is happening has made its way here. I believe you, If we are gonna do anything for Norman, we have to go right now. What do you mean? Just come with me to the car, We will talk on the way. OK. What do we need to do? We have to do this my way. You have to listen to me and do exactly as I tell you. OK... What is this? What? OK this thing is coming out tonight so we have to be ready. Are you sure we shouldn't try to lure it to us? That won't work, stupid. Look. If you see the Sheriff, you can't hesitate. He won't be himself. He will be under this things control and he will try to hurt you. OK. OK, do we need something special to kill this thing like a knife or silver bullets? Are you some kind of asshole? I told you... This thing was once a man, that's why I have a shotgun. If that doesn't work, then I have a handgun. If you get a chance, don't fucking miss. I won't. Oh... Wait.... This is the best I could come up with. Put these in. These are noise cancelling. I can't take a chance of you guys getting under this things control. Yeah and that leaves us unable to hear. So use your eyes. Please... Let me stop you there. What were you planning to do? At this point... At this point... I was convinced there was something supernatural out there. Supernatural? Yes... And I know it sounds crazy... Sitting here, in this safe place, miles away. But after the things that I had seen and heard, I was positive there was something out there. I was gonna hunt it down. Agent... Lets talk about New Mexico for a minute. What does that have to do with anything? Maybe nothing. Maybe everything. I'm here to try to understand... Why things transpired as they have. And I feel that... The fact that you had recently returned from a major incident and a disciplinary leave of absence may explain some of this. In what possible way? Perhaps Post Traumatic Stress... Oh Bullshit! Could be. Just a theory. I don't know. Right now. But we gotta find out. I bet you never saw yourself hiding in a forest... Waiting for this thing when you first took this case, huh Agent? That case you asked me about... New Mexico? That was the last case I worked on. We were investigating a be trafficking ring. They were operating all over the United States. They were selling heroine, meth... You name it. All low quality shit. They were leaving overdose after overdose everywhere they went. We were finally able to pin one down... Get him to tell us where the main hub of operations was at. New Mexico... We raided the place and we found everything. Drugs... money... gun... It was a career making case. We also found a hatch. That lead to a sub-basement. And when we went down there, we found 10 kids chained to the wall. They were being used for sex slavery... Some of them were so young, they wouldn't know anything outside of that life. I lost it. I went up and grabbed one of the guys we busted and started to beat him with the butt of my gun. I hit him over and over again. I almost killed him. Creatures come in all forms... Very little surprises me anymore. Would you consider that excessive force? Yes. Did you lose control? On that day, in that situation, I failed to use sufficient level of discretion Oh come on. Don't talk to me like you're in front of the panel. Not now. Did you lose control? You have no idea what I saw there. Yes or no? Simple question. That's all I'm asking. I've been sitting her all day answering your fucking questions. Ok, don't talk to me like that. I'm trying to help you. HOW? How are you helping me? By probing me. But helping you not sound like you're crazy. OK YES! Yes. I saw those kids. And I saw the man with there key around his neck and I lost control. Are you happy now? I'm happier. Alright. I'm sorry. Huh... Tell me what happened when a... Before they found you in the woods. So the common theme with this thing was the noises it made. It lured you in with this song. It hypnotized you somehow. Howards answer to that was wearing noise cancelling headphones. My concern what not being able to hear each other... And I was right. Anybody see anything move through there? No, Nothing. Put in you ear plugs. It knows we're here. Muffled sound of heartbeat, slowly accelerating. Heavy muffled breathing... Slow violin sounds... Tense fast drums start... Fighting and punching... Grunting sounds... ...SINGLE GUNSHOT... Heavy breathing.... creepy violin... Unnatural guttural sounds... ...SINGLE GUNSHOT... -HIGH PITCH EAR RINGING- Creepy Bass MUSIC I don't remember much after that. I got hit in the head and never saw it coming. When I woke up, I checked on Howard and half of his head was missing. I found the Deputy. Her neck had been fractured and she looked like she had been drug around by teeth. But you made it out. Look. I barely remember walking out of that forest, let alone calling it in. Whatever that thing was, it killed everyone out there, I don't know why it left me. OK... Im sorry. Just calm down. Move on. So after that, you flew home after spending the night in a local hospital. Scratches and bruises, a cracked few ribs. A few loose teeth. You make it home and what happens? Sitting here, just like I am, talking to you and she knocks on the door. Agent, you and I both know it wasn't animals. What happened there was done by something. And I don't believe it was an isolated occurrence. There have been several hotspots in the last 30 years where unsolved missing person cases have occured. Hotspots? For lack of a better term, yes. It's... Would hunting ground be more appropriate? The Everglades, the Pine Barons, parts of the Appalachian Mountains. The Mojave dessert and the Island you just left. It's a migration. A hunting pattern and it's gone on for decades. And I know where it's going next. Where? If the pattern stays true, The Pine lake, Wisconsin area is where you'll find it. Why are you so interested in this? I'm Raye. I'm a doctor. If it's alright, I have a few questions for you. Do you remember going to the house today? Yes. Do you remember what happened? Yes. Do you know who's house it was? Somebody that Ted knows. Who is... who is Ted? He is someone to fear... Is that why you listen to him? Because you're afraid? Yes... What about your family? When was the last time you saw them? I haven't spoken to them in years. How many years? I don't know. A few. Why? Ted wouldn't let me talk to them. Are they here now? Can I see them? Lindy... When your parents sent you away for awhile, were you angry at them? No, They told me I was sick and needed to feel better. Did you know that the house you were in was your parents house? That's not true. I'm afraid it is true, No... I would have known and Ted wouldn't... Lindy... I don't think Ted exists. Yes he does. He took care of me in the hospital. There was no record of any patient, employee or visitor with that name, at the facility at the time you were there. I didn't make him up. I think maybe you did. Ted is a fictitious entity that you have created. No. He isn't real. No. You don't know what I've seen... You don't know what I've seen. Lindy... Members of your family were murdered today, Your little brother hid, but he saw everything. He is in a room down the hall. I just spoke to him. And he told me that the person that killed his family was his big sister. No... Lindy? You... He also said you were alone. You've done something horrible today. OK, even if you are right, how do we kill it? If this thing is something else, would bullets een work? Well I started looking at these bodies,. The ones that were found and I was looking to see if there was anything in common. And they do. They do. Have you heard of Hemochromatosis? I haven't. It's more commonly call the Iron Overload Disease. It's where your body produces an unhealthy amount of Iron in your blood. OK? So it doesn't like iron. So when it tastes it in the blood it retreats. Iron has to be what can kill it. So what, I'm gonna find this thing and give it a blood disease? What are you, a fucking idiot? Iron slugs. And even if iron isn't a weakness, these things will tear it apart. OK... What do I need to do? I followed the the pattern of the creature. When he's not here, I've looked for his den in the daytime This is a map... You have to go at night when he's most vulnerable. Follow the map and finish it. ...Tense music in the background... ...The eerie sounds of the woods at night... ...Music is building the intensity...
