THE KAISER'S LACKEY Diederich Hessling was a delicate child. He was frightened of everything. He feared his father the most. Drill-sergeant Father wielded his cane with an expression of duty and honor. Diederich also feared his mother's scary stories. The toad was an evil spirit which abducted bad children. It sucked them down into a deep, dark pond. He survived his father, the toad, God Almighty and the policeman. The sweep who could drag you through a long, dark chimney. The doctor who painted your throat until you nearly choked. After all these horrors Diederich met one power which eats children alive: School. Stand! Sit! Stand! Sit! Diederich Hessling! Wipe the board. - Troschinsky did it. - Good boy. What's 1 x 1? Hessling? When was the Battle of Teutoburg Forest? What is the Fifth Commandment? It's your turn, Hessling! Thou shalt not kill. How many glorious wars were won by the Hohenzollerns? All of you. The First Silesian War. The Second Silesian War. The Seven Years' War. The Wars of Liberation from Napoleon which were waged from 1813 to 1814. The Prusso-Danish War. It was won in the year of 1864. The Seven Weeks' War defeating the Austrian Empire in 1866. Today we look back on our history with a feeling of gratitude. We admire what has become of the splintered German people. A people divided against itself in ongoing conflict. We see a united people. An invincible nation. A magnificent empire. Let us remember the well-said humble words of our beloved Monarch. The Kaiser whom we are proud to refer to as our Wilhelm the Great. God hath wrought a true miracle. Our most heartfelt desire is to praise and honor our dearly beloved Emperor. As heir apparent he already demonstrated his courage and military skills at the battles of Königgrätz and Wörth. Let us pledge allegiance to this great man. We have no fear for our Fatherland under his courageous leadership. No people on the face of the earth can boast such a brilliant Monarch as we can. His statesmanlike foresight will ensure Germany a prosperous future. He is not only our commander-in-chief. He is also summus episcopus. The Defender of our Faith. He is Patron of the Arts. The Protector of the Sciences. Surpassing all predecessors, Wilhelm II will lead our research to the worldwide prestige that it has long deserved. He earns our infinite gratitude. Our heartfelt adoration. To His Majesty! Our beloved Emperor! Diederich's parents sent him to Berlin to study. He lived near the University and was often homesick. A letter from your parents! The letter contained admonitions, worries, questions and answers. It also told him to visit the Göppels. Mr. Göppel, who did business with Hessling Paper of Netzig. Mrs. Göppel. Two aunts, engrossed as usual in needlework. Their lodger, a student named Mahlmann and Diederich during his first visit. One chair remains empty. Thanks to people like Mr. Buck we can sit here as free men. - Netzig's hero. - He's a friend of my father's. - He was sentenced to death in 1848. - I know. And today? What's the situation today? - I don't know. - They want to tread on us again. Right. My daughter, Agnes. Hessling Junior. Be seated. How about our usual stroll? - If Father allows... - Take Hessling too. It's late. - What are you studying, young man? - Chemistry. - Physics. - Chemistry. - Exactly. - Do you know Berlin? Do you like Berlin? Have you been to the theater or a concert? No. That doesn't interest me. I have to go. I have an appointment. With a girl, Don Juan? That doesn't interest me. He's a college friend. May I take my leave? - Come next Sunday. - Show him out, Agnes. - Such charming young people. - Yes, extremely charming. Are you angry with me? Mr. Hessling, really! I got away too. The family gossip is a bore. Do you like her? She's very pretty. Available too, if I know women at all. She steals glances at you. - Her eye movement doesn't grab me. - I believe you. Let's go. Got any money? - Yes. - How much? Okay. I'll show you Berlin. The trumpets of the Lord do sound When we go marching by. Drums and fifes and bugles resound As Berliners echo our battle cry. We're the aces, best of races. But if we plod, it's the firing squad. We're the soldiers of the Kaiser. We uphold the Altar and Throne. The world has no braver nor wiser. The nation's elite and God's own. Eyes left, eyes right, stomach in! The world has no braver nor wiser. The nation's elite and God's own. The following Sunday Hessling made his way reluctantly to the Göppels. Young Mr. Hessling. Thank you. Do come in. - I'm invited. - Yes, I know. Lunch is ready. Good day to you all. How lovely! Hessling junior is here. There he is. Glad you could come. Have a seat. Luncheon is served. - Good day, Agnes. - Good day, Mr. Hessling. Did you bring the lovely flowers? Come here, Agnes. - Can you stay longer this time? - Or do you have another appointment? No, not this time. You're so nice today. - I always try to be nice. - Really? Come over here. Excuse me. You are really making eyes at her. Listen to me. When my studies are over you can inherit her. - Keep away from her until then. - You have no right to say that. Just leave. Say your goodbyes to everyone and explain that you must go now. You have 5 minutes to do so. No way. Diederich gave in to his rival. The power which forced itself upon him had returned. It frightened him as much as the toad in the fairy tale. Diederich left the Göppel residence. He also left Agnes. He gave her up completely. Because he feared the lodger. Back home he took it out on his toughest books. He sized up a formidable coffee pot. The scoundrel! The scoundrel! If he weren't so strong... I heard loud voices. I thought you had company. - Nobody's here. - Yes there is. - No visitor! - You have one! He's waiting in the hall. Come in, young man. - Evening! - Hornung, what a surprise! - Your sister gave me your address. - Pleasant to see you. - You joined a student corps? - Sure, the Neo-Teutons. They're tops. Your family sends their regards. Your old man's not too well. - What's wrong with him? - His Franco-Prussian War wound. - Is it bad? - I'm not a doctor. - Won't you sit down? - No, I came to take you out. - Where? - To our drinking hole. - You need better company. - I have no time for a corps. Forget your studies! This is more important. - Just as a visitor. - They're expecting you. - Don't fail me. - I'll just look on. Diederich became a drinksman. Silence, brothers. I order a rousing Salamander toast. We drain our glasses to our own Dr. Nieburger. Fellow Neo-Teutons. Thank you for your salute. I'm obliged to reciprocate. To you all. - To mutual respect! - I second that. - May I join you? - Good health. More power to you and yours. To rootin' shootin' Teutons! Each fellow drank to the health of his companions. Drinking, speaking, standing and sitting followed a ritual. It gave him a feeling of harmony. After Hessling had been initiated into the art of dueling he had to take the next obligation upon himself to honor his membership. That man. - Excuse me? - What is it? - You were staring at us. - Staring at whom? We sat opposite you. You are mistaken, Sir. I was looking into my cup but not at you. Satisfied? - You stared at us. - I'm sorry, but you're really mistaken. My fellow saw it, also. If you're looking for a scar. I suggest you go to a barber's. - He's not getting anywhere. - Who? The Neo-Teuton. He refused. Two brandies. - Sir? - Yes? You insulted my friend. I don't even know him. That's irrelevant. You insulted our corps. Accept my challenge! Or do you refuse to duel with me? Silence! En garde! Duel! Stop. Our man yields. Silence. The Neo-Teuton is disabled. The time now is exactly 9:14 a.m. Suite ex. The opponent took a thrashing. He took eleven slashes in all. I drink to your health. A telegram. The landlady was in a barn beside the lovely River Lahn. She lay on her back and sailor Jack... Silence! "My dear son. We must be prepared for the worst. Get here as fast as you possibly can if you wish to see your beloved father one more time. Your mother." How is the factory doing? Last year we made a total profit of about 9000 marks. - Is that all? - You must consider the situation. I understand. Many changes must be made. - I'm responsible for the family. - Don't be as stingy as your father. - Emmi! - We begged for every cent. You loafed until now. Not with me! - You of all people! - Yes, me. Mr. Buck is here. Ask him in. My dear Mrs. Hessling. You know you can count on me if you are ever in need of help. I want to remain a true friend to you. My heartfelt condolences. Young man, I hope you will be as good a citizen as your father was. Respect the rights of your fellow men. - Your own human dignity requires it. - Yes, sir. Are you returning to Berlin? Yes, tomorrow. I must finish service. Diederich got a taste of cadet treatment. The whole military set-up was aimed to reduce one's dignity to a minimum. This impressed him. Despite his misery he was filled with respect. He experienced a kind of suicidal élan. There is nothing I wish more than to stay forever. - The officer's mess... - This place is what I call a mess. Slowly but surely one sank to the depths. One became lowly clay which was kneaded into shape. - I'm beat. - Tell the captain. Double time! - My foot hurts. - Tell him. Double time! Attention! I'm sorry, Captain. My foot's hurting me. What a disaster. He unknowingly spoke to an almighty power. One which demanded unquestioning obedience. Diederich visited a doctor the very next Sunday. A fellow Neo-Teuton. He asked him for help. He loved being in the army and desperately wanted to serve. But his foot hurt him and he needed some advice. I'm afraid I'll be crippled. I have a family to take care of. It looks bad, old fellow. A severe case of pes planus. I advise against you remaining in service. - It could remain. - Heavens! No, put on your shoe. I have an impression of your foot. I happen to know your company medic. He's a good friend of mine. I'll have a man-to-man chat with him. I am grateful to you. Neo-Teutons forever. My captain gave me this as a farewell present. Believe me. It was an unforgettable experience. I won't smoke it. I can tell you. It makes you see things differently. My captain begged me to stay on. Agnes went all out to meet her hero by chance. Until now she had been unsuccessful. This time she managed. - Miss Göppel. - What an unexpected coincidence. - But a pleasant one. - I'm delighted to see you. My oh my. You're getting prettier. - It's been ages. - I've been busy. Military service, college... - This is my new address. - I know. - Cold? - No. Enter. I hope I can trust you. I am an honorable member of my student corps. May I? Don't be angry. I'm crying for joy. I waited so long for you. - I'm fully aware of my responsibilities. - Responsibilities? Who is responsible? You didn't know I always loved you. Really? - You loved only me? - You don't believe me? I wanted to write. I wanted to visit you. I was afraid. My only thoughts were of you. Is that so? And what about Mahlmann? I'm sorry, Agnes. I didn't mean it. - Maybe I'll never come again. - Why ever not? - Especially now... - You have no obligations. Dear Agnes. I shall never neglect any of my obligations to you. If I could be your wife one fine day... That would be fine. - He has an excellent eye. - Diederich. I'm so happy I could die. Life will never be like this again. I am so fond of you too. What if we capsize? - I'll save you. - The water is so terribly deep. We'd drown. - Would you be glad to die with me? - Yes. I'd rather live. - We'll be together all day long. - And all night as well. Like a honeymoon. I want to be strong. I can feel it within me. I'll dedicate my life to you. Come in, whoever you are. - Mr. Göppel? - Yes, just me. Did you come to see me? - Why? - Your cutaway coat. I defended my dissertation today. Please accept my congratulations. I have come to see you because Agnes is not feeling very well. - What's wrong with her? - It's her heart. Her heart is weak. Maybe you could visit us? I wanted to. Unfortunately I leave for home tomorrow. - Going home? - Yes. For good? You can't. After all that has happened. - Then you have been informed? - I wasn't fully informed. - I trusted my daughter. - That was a mistake. - I trusted you as well. - You thought I was naive? No. But I didn't realize what a lousy cad you are. Name your weapon! Seduce the daughter and then shoot the father? - To consummate your honor. - That's not your department. Perhaps. What did we do to offend you? Do you want to hear the truth? My moral principles forbid me to wed someone of your daughter's virtue. Someone who is not unblemished. Diederich was proud of his good upbringing. He was made fit by his corps, the army and the imperialist spirit. Diederich decided to implement his hard-earned principles at home. To be a pioneer of his times. Stop the train. Stop laughing. Help me. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Please remove your feet. I wish to sit there. Amazing, really. You eat the sausage alone. - Without biting a finger off. - If you weren't so rude I'd share. If you weren't so courteous I would graciously decline. Know what you look like? Young. Scrumptious. Clean. - Like a fresh-washed piglet. - I can't return the compliment. Ladies don't use that word. - I'm Dr. Diederich Hessling. - Then we've met each other before. Good Lord. Gusti Daimchen. Little Gusti. You always came over our wall. - Mostly with no knickers. - I'm engaged to be married! Mother. My dear son. Now you are home forever. Yes, Mother. I shall always bear my duty in mind. God above holds me accountable for all of you here. Gusti's worth millions. Millions? How come? An uncle in Magdeburg she cared for left it to her. He was wealthy. They spent a year alone together. Time for a lot to happen. That's idle gossip. Everyone says so. You must put a stop to this gossip. I insist on that. Immediately. - Let's meet the workers. - They're waiting. Men and women. You are my dependents. From now on I expect you to put your nose to the grindstone. There has been no master here lately. Many of you thought you could take things easy. You were mistaken. You can count on my fatherly benevolence. Revolutionary ideas will fail against my unbending will. Should I find any connection between any of you and the Social Democratic movement we part company. I won't tolerate any Social Democratic sympathizer. They're enemies of my business and my Fatherland. That was all. Now return to your work. Bear in mind what I have said to you all today. Sötbier! What's all this? - This is not a bar. - It's a special day. Insubordination. You're here to work. - Are you ill? - No. Come in here. Lie down. I'll be okay in a minute. I'm not working here much longer. But Karl. Remember we need the money. I know that. Stay here. Don't move. I'll get you some coffee. Where's the worker? - Which worker? - The hollander operator. Maybe in the restroom. That's the last straw. What's going on? She's my fiancee. - She's feeling ill. - Fiancee? Mills don't have fiancees! Everyone here is a worker. You're pigs and thieves. I'll fire you and sue you for indecency. I enforce German virtues. My commands are the law. - Even if you frown. - I'm not frowning. Do your job. You're to blame for this. I'm no spy. You're an insolent fellow. What's your name? My name's Napoleon Fischer. The name suits you. - You're a Social Democrat, I bet. - That's true. That's what I thought. The next morning he set off in his impeccable morning coat to honor the town dignitaries by paying his respects. Bismarck worked wonders. Because he was allowed to do it. He got his way by pretending to do it in the name of the emperor. We 48'ers were more honest about it. I immediately paid the price for my revolutionary zeal. I know. You were sentenced to death. I defended the sovereignty of the National Parliament. I fought to abolish caste privileges. I led the common people to revolt in their hour of need. The unity of Germany was a matter of conscience. The personal duty of every individual. It was the Hohenzollerns who forged the empire. That's another story. I hope you will soon belong to the town council. If you nominate me - I'd be glad to serve. - Your help will be invaluable. Like your father's. I'm a thoroughgoing Liberal. I must warn you against Governor von Wulckow. I am privileged to be ignored by him. The pews were empty on Jubilate. I preached to 3 cloistered old maids and the sexton. Attitudes are so hostile to the Church that I'm surprised anyone came. I had a business obligation. Dr. Hessling! Are you back in town again? Let me introduce you to each other. Dr. Mennicke, this is Dr. Hessling. - Neo-Teuton? - Banner high! He fired us - both of us. - Why? - On the spot? Why? I suppose my face didn't fit. What about Fischer? He only protests at meetings. Just imagine the public disgrace. A court official arm in arm with a store owner! - They treat us like pawns. - Forget it. We'll get work somewhere. With whom? They're thick as thieves. - Move on! - I'm scared. We stay. - We won't hurt you. - Move on. - My church is almost empty. - Don't worry about that, Pastor. - Lord have mercy! - That will change. His Majesty has decreed that more churches be built. - That was a shot. - The revolution! Help me. Someone help me! The soldier fired on us. - What happened? - He's dying! - My factory hand. - Get up, Karl. Stand back. - What's wrong? - Nobody knows. - Stand back. - He's been shot. - Isn't anyone giving first aid? - Take a look, Doctor. What do you have to say about all this? - He who fires may not bear the guilt. - He is dead. - Karl. My darling Karl. - Can we help you? You live nearby? She's under arrest as an accomplice. The woman is in no condition to be arrested. Why not arrest the corpse? I forbid criticism of my decisions. I fired them for indecent acts. Between man and wife? - They aren't married. - Irrelevant. Have things come to that? Is it now irrelevant if God's laws are obeyed or not? Does God's law permit the authorities to rifle down citizens? I'll give her a job. Are you criticizing the authorities' decisions? I just criticized the man with the villainous mustache. His Majesty has one like it. It shows German character. How dare you scream in front of my home? I forbid it. Where is the sentry? You did your duty, son. He provoked you. His Majesty will reward you for your bravery. Move on. Or I'll open fire. - Let us go elsewhere. - We need a drink. Have him taken away and clear the street. There is no doubt about it. The sentry responded correctly. A few months ago His Majesty added his stamp of approval in a similar case. He praised the sentry's bravery. The Kaiser pardoned and decorated the loyal soldier. One human life is a fair price to make the mob toe the line. - If it's not your life, Doctor. - Even if it were mine. - I thought we are all nationals. - We are all nationalists. Do we pay our army for such cruelty? Your army? The merchant king possesses an army! That calls for champagne. - Consider the loss of life. - That's no consideration. Opposition calls for tough retribution. Let him appeal to God. Does God like Socialists? The Bible says all are alike in the eyes of God. Heaven forbid. Listen. There's a ruler in heaven and one on earth. As well as presidents and generals. Is the ruling caste superior? Not racially. They all have Jewish blood. Even princes. It doesn't harm them. How can anyone say such a thing? Mr. Lauer, you claim ruling families are infested with Jews. Do you include German dynasties? Certainly. And do you include in your list one family I need not specify? One I won't dare name in this insulting connection. Certainly. - I'd better be going now. - I'll accompany you, Judge. Hear that, Pastor? Blessed is he who sitteth not in the seat of the scoffers. Rats leave sinking ships. He should keep his opinion to himself. Look at that. A human life is being swept away. Did he say that? - I swear it's true. - Now we have him. - Hello. - Can I help you, Major? An eventful day, I hear. - True. - Sorry I missed it. - Another glass. I'm Hessling. - My name's Kunze. Yes, Major. We certainly set them straight. They're afraid they'll be next. They will be. I promise you that. - I'll handle that. - It's time to restore order. - To next year's Reichstag elections. - A campaign begins with champagne! - Count me in. - Me too. His Majesty expects citizens to come to their senses at last. Unpatriotic tendencies will be stamped out. - With fire and sword! - I'll drink to that. - Alcohol fuels their patriotism. - I quote His Majesty: - "You officers are my spearhead." - The Kaiser relies on the Church. "If the Church forces the princes..." We fear no opponent on God's earth. We have a roused, agitated agitator. - A charismatic, personal personality. - Unrivaled and unprecedented. Given to us sinners by the Grace of God! - It's not all your money. - We've inherited it, also. If I paid you off you'd be surprised how little we have. We're surprised already. We can't afford our fashion designer and you carouse all night. Am I a lackey who must work for you all? Of course not, my son. You have a lot of responsibilities. - You caused that man's death. - What will become of the poor girl? Silence, you silly geese. - Yes? - Prosecutor Mennicke is here. - Show him in to my study. - Yes, sir. We'll talk about it later. He has delusions of grandeur. Emmi, dear! Dieder is such a good boy. I think we're in for some more surprises. Cigar? I'm considering indictment for lèse-majesté. - You? - I'm filling as district attorney. - But if nobody complains? - That's unnecessary. You said last night you would come forward as witness. - I don't remember saying that. - I trust you'll remember in court. Dear fellow. You obviously intend to proceed with a political trial to further your career. - Your career is not my affair. - Same here. - So we are adversaries? - I hope that can be avoided. All you have to do is testify. With discretion if you like. With utmost discretion. Why should I help to jail a decent man like Lauer? - Decent? - Indeed. My head! Of course he's a decent man. Political beliefs are not punishable. Yesterday you wanted to die for His Majesty. Things went wrong for Diederich. The prosecutor summoned the witnesses. Is he who casts the first stone without sin? Rev. Zillich's eyes pointed right at Diederich. Everyone knew who had inspired the sermon. His business started to suffer. Regular customers stopped ordering. In his time of need Guste Daimchen was his last hope. She refused to see him. Everything was going wrong in politics, business and love. Our hero recalled the victory party. Enemy blood flowed outside and champagne flowed inside. Then Major Kunze arrived. - You've been keeping quiet lately. - That's more than can be said for you. Major, would you care for a glass of wine? I'm hung over from your champagne. When will I be honored by admission to the Veterans' Association? After you honored me by involvement in your scandal? - My scandal? - Yes, indeed. Lauer did go too far. That can happen even to veterans. His lèse-majesté is of no concern to slackers like you. - His Majesty has no use for slackers. - Here are my discharge papers. That's just what I thought. Flat feet! Adieu! Good to see you. - You're laughing at me? - I'm not as foolish as the old major. I cannot sympathize with a sentry who shoots a worker in cold blood. That is a point on which we will never agree. A pity. - You'll change your mind in court. - That's why you're here? - You haven't heard? - You're visiting your fiancee. True, but the main reason is to defend my brother-in-law. - You're defending Lauer? - My father didn't tell you? I rarely see him. A bridge has been torn down which could have united people. - I don't understand. - Maybe you will. Maybe not. I shall say unpleasant things to you in court. It's inevitable. You are my enemy, then? My sympathy for you isn't that strong. - Adieu. - There's no more to say. You consumed lots of alcohol that evening? Objection! We were a lively party that evening. The adjoining table was also full. That's all I know. That is all you recall? Let me refresh your memory. You informed the examining magistrate that the accused maliciously slandered His Imperial Majesty. That may be. There were a number of gentlemen there that evening. - Maybe it wasn't the accused... - Other witnesses will testify that you spoke to the accused. Was it me? - Any more questions? - Not at present. The witness is excused. Call Rev. Zillich. Rev. Zillich. You treated the matter as it deserved. Rev. Zillich, you were present that evening. - You know which evening? - Yes. You were witness to the conversation between the accused and Hessling? Yes, I was indeed. You remember exactly what happened? Exactly? The clergy is aware of the sanctity of one's oath. Dr. Mennicke! Then I must admit to the fact that I did hear the accused say all of the things he allegedly said that night. - I didn't name the Emperor. - Ask Rev. Zillich one thing. Did he preach against Hessling's incitement? I often make use of current events to illustrate more vividly the message of my sermons. Thank you. The witness is excused. Major Kunze. Major Kunze. Major Waldemar Kunze Retired. Single. Born in Werneuchen on 9.9.1827. Raise your right hand and repeat after me. - Pathetic, isn't it? - I beg your pardon? - Your court behavior is quite pathetic. - Yes, sir. Do you want to be accepted by us? Then you must soon decide if you're for us or against us. - I'm showing loyalty to the Emperor. - I decide on government contracts. Major, describe what happened that evening. I say that his affairs... ...affirmations mark Dr. Hessling as an informer. - Father would have stopped it. - He'd box Diederich's ears. You're to blame. You spoiled him. The witness is excused. - Summon Dr. Heuteufel. - Call Dr. Heuteufel. - Raise your right hand and swear. - We should not swear in this witness. He is a potential co-defendant. The witness is one of those our Emperor calls stateless waifs. His subversive tendencies culminate in his atheism. The pious prosecutor doubts the honesty of an atheist? That is contempt of court. Witness! Do you admit that you encouraged or even incited the accused Mr. Lauer to commit lèse-majesté? - I admit nothing. - Better witnesses are here. Unimpeachable men who vouch for his loyalty to Kaiser and country. - The mayor and Gov. von Wulckow. - What chutzpah! His workers confirm his integrity and benevolence. I demand a plebiscite. The defense is going just a little too far. The court has enough evidence to reach a verdict. - The case is clear-cut. - Doubtlessly. The witness is excused. We can forego further testimony. Right? Go on, Doctor. Be courageous. Don't forget I'm here to back you up. Witness Hessling? I beg to be allowed to add to my earlier testimony. I do not deny it. I challenged him. Would he say the incriminating word? He said it and I reported him. I just fulfilled my duty. I would do the same thing again and again. Even if I had to endure even greater disadvantages than I had to bear in recent times. Our citizens must cease to depend solely on the State and its organs to fight the revolutionary elements. We must act ourselves. His Majesty's own words. Should I hesitate? Anyone who dares to sling mud at the holy person of our Monarch can't call himself a German. About time, too. Therefore, Your Honors, I was justified to... Nay, I was obligated! I had to act vigorously to stop the defendant. Without malice for the sake of the issue. Impartiality is German. Yes, Your Honors. I stand by my actions. They represent my exemplary lifestyle. It rests upon honor in the home. It knows neither lies nor immorality. Anything more to say, defendant? That is pointless. Please be seated. We shall adjourn. Clear the courtroom. The prosecution will sum up at 4 p.m. You did well, I must say. Good standpoint. See you later. Diederich's clear words in the courtroom improved his social status at once. A highlight was indisputably the invitation from von Wulckow's wife. Diederich was now a member of Netzig's high society. I have heard a great deal of praise of your excellent stance recently with regard to the unfortunate matter involving Lauer. Please accept my humble admiration. Too kind. - Did you serve? - I did indeed, Colonel. I wish I had stayed on. We can't all be officers. - We need a few decent civilians, too. - Indeed, Colonel. It is a pleasure to dance with you. - You flatter me, Lieutenant. - No, I mean it. - Ottochen! - I'm not in here. Tell the fools to drink tea alone. The Governor's busy, I fear. I must return to my guests. She glided away. Diederich waited in vain for a sign. Then the dog appeared. He passed Diederich with an air of disdainful pride. He scratched at the door. Wulckow called out. Enter! The dog opened the door enabling Diederich to slip into the room. Good afternoon. Learned to talk, Schnaps? You can be proud of your brother. Oh, it's you. Please be seated. Thank you, Governor. Laura understands me. She is so gentle to me. - Laura? - Yes. She's a delightful creature. She rubs my face with her nose. - You mean your horse. - Certainly. Governor. I know a certain way to be rid of our worst enemy. I mean Klüsing. - You mean your competitor. - I am speaking only as a patriot. Listen to me. It seems you want the whole cake. The Netzig News, the regional papers. I suppose you want to supply the government with paper. - What else? - God is my witness. I'd rather lose my factory than do business with the revolution. Our conservative party will help you become a town council member. The bourgeois are being duped by the nationalists. A soldier with fixed bayonet will oversee every worker. - We'll be shot down like our comrade. - Murderers are rewarded. - What can we do? - Strike. Can we afford to? I can afford my convictions. I'm a Social Democrat. Then someone else gets my job and my family starves. Time is not ripe for such protests. It's only worth striking if there's hope of success. - We have to be tactful. - Comrades, we must be wary. Wilhelm fears the Left. I say beware of the Right. It's your problem. Fischer works in your factory. Listen to me. Wait till Old Man Kühlemann dies. We get the 500,000 Mark legacy. We won't heed the Social Democrats and waste it on a union hall. Nor on public nurseries for Free Think Liberals. We'll stand by our Emperor and build him a statue. Dr. Buck's life was also changed by the libel case against Lauer. Buck loved the stage. He despised bourgeois society. He decided to accept a role at the Netzig Town Theater. The director knew Buck would be a success. He was a local celebrity. But the sensation had to be kept secret. - I don't believe it. - Pardon? Someone told me I could find Dr. Buck here. I'm his fiancee. My heart hath spoken. She has been sent to us. Sent by Almighty God. A sun emerged on her radiant countenance. The golden sun of heartfelt emotion. Drop... your weapons. Be at peace with another. He is crying. He is overcome. He is one... of ours. Curtain! Thank you. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? - What brings you here? - Answer me! Consider your position. I'm doing more than considering my position. I'm reconsidering it. What will people think? Comic opera! Come home now! - They're rank amateurs. - No! I'm staying here. These comedians put on less of a comedy than you. They are more honest, too. I've finished with you. I'd like to talk to you. Have a seat. A drink? A cigar? Listen to me, my dear Fischer. I'm running for councilman. So am I. Well, I never. You are always full of surprises. - Let's drink first. - My party's a shoo-in. We'll win one of the two seats. The Liberals the other. You need us to oust them. I'm aware of that. Cheers. You sure staged a nationalist spectacle at the trial. - I just did my patriotic chore. - We're alone. You don't fool me. - One condition, though. - I'm listening. Go on. I want you to support the union hall at council meetings. You demand that from a nationalist! But where will you be without our support? What? - You're interrupting. - Major Kunze wants to see you. Major Kunze. I'll forget your strange behavior towards me on certain past occasions. If you endorse my membership to the full assembly of the Veterans Association. As follows: Doctor Diederich Hessling remained loyal to Kaiser and country. All contrary rumors were lies. His intervention made it possible to rebuff stateless waifs. - "Stateless elements" is better. - Right. To rebuff stateless elements and teach them a lesson. He fought a brave battle at great personal expense. He displayed a true German character at all times. At all times. I'll send you the text. Doctor Hessling remained loyal to Kaiser and country. Contrary rumors are lies. His intervention made it possible to rebuff stateless elements and teach them a lesson. He fought a brave battle at great personal expense. He displayed true German character. I close this assembly by remembering our leader. His Majesty Kaiser Wilhelm the Second. A doctor of chemistry. Neo-Teuton, factory owner and member of the Netzig Veterans Association. Diederich suddenly felt the need to thank his Maker for all his mercy. It was getting late. He decided to visit the factory instead. He ran straight into fate's arms. Guste Daimchen was headed for the factory as well. Guste forgot all rebuffs. She was out to conquer Netzig's rising star. - Miss Daimchen. - Hello. - Visiting me? - Your sister. Magda is at home. No, Emmi. I thought she was here. No. But while you are here... - May I show you the factory? - I'd be delighted. What's going on? It's 2 minutes to the hour. No, it's exactly 1 minute past. - Your watch is wrong. - That's impossible. - He's impudent. - A Social Democrat. How do you like my mechanical pulping room? It's a bit small. Come back next year. You'll be surprised. Do you have the money? One moment! What's under her apron? Nothing of yours. She's expecting. How romantic. Like a mountain landscape. Come with me. I've something to show you. - Know where we are now? - No. Once I caught a worker with a girl on this very spot. They were... You know... He was shot later. Right here? How exciting. I always knew... You always knew I was a good catch. Your pittance... Pittance? I've got 350,000 in the bank. - I'm so alone in the world. - No, you're not. Not any longer. - Have I put on weight? - Not at all, my dear. You're still willowy. Comes from riding. The world looks different from a saddle. I adore horses. - Don't forget to adore me, too. - You are such a sweet rogue. Rags! The Prussian drill book gives a soldier exact instructions. He needn't think. He just abides by the rules. Civilians have a similar book. The Holy Bible. The Ten Commandments can be seen as a kind of civilian drill book. Comrade Hessling and honorable spouse. Abide by its rules at all times and in your hours of ecstasy don't forget your benefactor. He was appointed by God to lead his people to new victories and to even greater power and glory. I hereby raise my glass to His Majesty, our glorious Emperor. That's what I say, Major. - Still taking riding lessons? - Is that forbidden? - To Switzerland? - Yes, Zurich. The room is reserved. We must slip away soon. World power! Dear guests. You are here to witness my marriage. You also get to admire a product of German efficiency and enterprise. My factory has just delivered the first sample to me. I am certain that one day this product will conquer markets worldwide. I am sure of this success. I have named our product accordingly. Our baby is called "World Power". Here it is. Toilet paper on a roll. We can now produce this innovation at the same cost as traditional wipes. But that's not all. Help me, Guste. We spread great ideas and messages expounded by German men of standing to the farthest corners of our beloved German fatherland. German wisdom heals the world. German piety cures Satan's society. The Rhine is Germany's river not Germany's border. A German flag never sags. Our precious Fatherland needs the output of all its children. I am a Prussian, true and blue. - Yes? - Any more food desired, sir? No. Remember my morning paper. Before we get down to business let us pause one second. In remembrance of His Grace, Kaiser Wilhelm II. One moment. I'm coming. Come in. Your newspaper. Thank you. Clear up the room a bit. The Kaiser's in Rome. Listen! German Emperor Visits King of Italy. Official sources confirm the rumors. Visit to Tighten Triple Alliance. Neutral countries are alarmed by Wilhelm II's imperialist course. Alarmed! Certainly! Guste! - Let me sleep. - The Kaiser's visiting Rome. - Who cares? - We're off for Rome. Up! Valet! Valet! We're leaving. Bring up our luggage. - Get up. - The bed is so comfortable. The Emperor's going to Rome. Get up! Good morning. Where's that valet? I am all of a tizzy. Can I help you? - Can't you knock? - The door is open. - When's the next train to Rome? - You have plenty of time. It leaves at 11:43. They were in Rome. The Kaiser... and his lackey. His Majesty entered his carriage. Hessling was full of enthusiasm. He pushed forward. Guste and the luggage were completely forgotten. Two leaders basked in Italian sun. They conversed intensely. Guste heard it. It got louder and louder. He waved and shouted. The two gentlemen paused. One leaned back slightly. Their eyes met. The Emperor smiled. They were alone for a few seconds. The Kaiser and his lackey. Guste was alone and forlorn. She wrote cards from the Eternal City to friends in Netzig. Night had fallen on Rome. The prominent guest retired to bed. Diederich was determined to guard over him all night long. His newlywed's sleep remained unguarded however. The church clock struck the midnight hour. Then it happened. Hessling spotted someone. He held a bomb. An anarchist! An assassin! He rushed over and grabbed the man. A fight for life and death ensued. The commotion attracted late passers-by to the scene. The struggle continued. Moments of suspense! He throws the bomb. He had already thrown the bomb. But it did not explode. Diederich stood up unbelievingly. No doubt about it. The bomb was a tin of paint. The suspected assassin was just a harmless artist. I don't believe a word of it. If the Italians were brighter your trip would have been a disaster. For Germany and the Emperor. That's why we issued no denial. I'm warning you, Hessling. If your political dilettantism continues there will be an explosion. Go away! I'll deal with him. You got government orders. And the local newspaper. Your sole rival is nearly bankrupt. His back's to the wall thanks to me! If the statue isn't built I'll have you arrested for fraud. I'll make mincemeat of you. You'll be so small. Too small for the nursery, understand? - Yes, Governor. - Out! Leave us alone now, Sister. My will has been drawn up with faith in local common sense. I believe it will prevail over bickering among parties. It is my will that Netzig be cured of selfish ambitiousness after I die. I understand. My most ardent wish is that you will soon be well again. Martha. Martha. Where are you? What's wrong? Can I help you? - You? No! - What's happened? Kühlemann is dead. I gave my word to the dying man as he fought for his last breath. I swore I would personally ensure that his generous legacy would be put to good use. To construct a monumental statue. An expression of the true patriotism and progressive beliefs in our beloved town Netzig. I forecast an economic boom. Are you waiting for someone to arrive? - I thought perhaps... - The Lieutenant? The Brietzens left yesterday. - They left? - Absolutely. Lt Brietzen leaves tomorrow. He's been transferred. Transferred? He'd have told me. He requested to be transferred. - If you want to know the truth. - You're lying. I now announce the final result. Hessling's resolution carried by one vote. What's wrong? What's happened? The statue will be built. What's wrong then? It's Emmi... - She tried... - She tried what? - She tried to commit suicide. - Oh? Tried to commit suicide! Where is she now? In her room. How selfish of her. Dear God. How could you let this happen? If you don't fear divine judgment then consider my situation. You don't care. You are not aware how serious it is. - If my fears are founded... - They are indeed. It's true... It's true. Emmi, I stand before you now in the name of duty and honor. Let me be. I want to help you. How can you help me? You can depend on me. I'll go to see him tomorrow. You can't. It's too late. We'll see about that. We're not totally defenseless. - You'll challenge him to a duel. - Why not indeed? Promise not to. Why not? My sister's honor is at stake. Swear to me solemnly you won't challenge him to a duel. He promised. He wanted to know who she was concerned for. He was afraid of her answer. He left the room as quietly as possible. Of course I accept. A duel with weapons... I mean... - If you and my sister were to... - I don't follow. Lieutenant, if you and my sister were to enter the holy bond of matrimony. I see. That's settled. I must explain more clearly. The code of honor of my regiment forbids me to wed a woman who is not unblemished. Then I'm obliged to inform your regiment commander. My commander thinks differently about the meaning of chivalry than a man who refuses a duel. Seduce the sister and then shoot the brother. You'd like that. If you don't leave at once I'll call for my aide. He who deals blows must be ready to take blows. Diederich left the room. He was pleased to register one fact. A Prussian lieutenant is inimitable. Your Excellencies. Honored ladies and gentlemen. When we unveil the statue of Wilhelm the Great we offer our humble thanks to the Hohenzollern dynasty. Their enlightened leadership has made Germany a world power. We are an elitist nation. For the first time in history we embody a German master culture. It can never be surpassed. Such grandeur cannot be attained by a master race which slumbers in peace. No, the greatness of a nation is only forged on the battlefield. Forged by blood and iron. We are therefore convinced that our main task is national defense. The highest honor is the king's uniform. The worthiest industry is forging weapons. Our oldest Ally agrees. Who would want to profit from his convictions? Where can we find corrupt civil servants? The glorious image of genuine Germanness is based on one foundation. Christianity. The only safe foundation. The Governor says we are to stop now. One final word. When the shroud falls, and the banners lowered in salute daggers are drawn and bayonets are at the ready... Such grandeur cannot be attained by a master race which slumbers in peace. No, the greatness of a nation is only forged on the battlefield. Forged by blood and iron. Thus spoke Diederich Hessling. And many repeated his words. Right to this very day. Subtitling: TITELBILD, Berlin with Peter Wilson and Alan Wildblood Copyright © 1998
