Shouldn't you be leaving? Uh, yeah. You know what you're doing, right? New, or not, I don't fuck around. Got it? Can you believe Leon asking me if he can come back home? Come back home! I don't know where the hell my damn son is, and he wants to know if he can come back home! Hey, are you calling from work? You know better than to call from work when you're upset. Call mom. Okay. Okay. Oh, shoot. I gotta go. It's been two weeks. You think I should file a police report? Yes, file a police report. Can I have your location please? Anyone there? Hello?

You've almost made it through another week. Congratulations, all you super doers, super take charge of your lifer's, super fighters, super kick ass, rockin' body babes. Today's focus is thighs and b- b- b- b- buns. So, all you need for today is your "can do" attitude, your willingness to feel that burn, and, of course, as always, your Lovely Lola Affirmation MP3s. Okay, you kick ass, rockin' body babes, let's ease our way down, so we can kick some serious ass on our thigh blasters. Here we go, and two, and three, feel the burn, four, five, and six, and seven, and eight, and nine, and ten. -Lengthen, make our way up. Yes, here we go, let's get these thighs and buns going, and up- Can I have your location, please? Um, yeah, I am stuck in an elevator. Okay, can I have your location, please? I'm at the corner of Pine and Woodward. Thank you. One moment, please. I'm sorry. Can I have your exact location, please? I said I'm stuck in an elevator at the corner of Pine and Woodward. There is no fucking exact location. Excuse me? Bitch, there is no fucking location. In order to assist you, um, you need to, adjust your tone, and tell me your exact location, please. Adjust my tone? I'm stuck in a fucking elevator! One moment, please. Oh, hell, no. He thinks I'm playing? That's right, you better run. You better watch your back. Watch your back. Oh, thank God that vegan place is so close. It's on Sunset, right? 'Cause I prefer the one in Santa Monica. I am so hungry. I am, like, starving. Ugh, I hope they have a gluten-free option. Oh, just wait! Wait! Damn elevator. Anyway, um, so, Colby, I will be there in, like, ten. Hello? Hello? Oh, that's great, my battery's dead, that's just what I need. It's the flippin' longest day in the world. I'll be okay. I'll be fine. All is well in my world. All is well in my world. What the hell? Hello? Anybody there? -Hello! -There ain't anybody there, man. Somebody'll come soon. It's nine-twenty, I- It's nine-thirty. My review is now. This cannot be happening. OMG. OMG? Why you talkin' like that? You some kinda fag or something? Oh, hell, no. I ain't about to get trapped up here with some- fuck. This just ain't my day. Mother fucker! What the fuck is happening? What the fuck is happening? The fuck? Ma'am, please don't worry. We'll be alright. Stay away from me! Are you really a faggot? You really a nigger? Fuck, are you- listen to this, mother fucker, never, never, ever- look at- See there's a camera in here? Now what did you say, huh? Just asked you a question in the same derogatory manner you asked me yours. Well, you better watch your mouth. Best watch yours. What, you lookin' for a ass whoopin'? Is that what turns you faggots on? You call me a faggot again, and I swear to God, I will call you a- That don't make no damn sense. They're both extremely derogatory terms that our people have worked so hard to overcome. Oh, what do you mean, "our people"? Right, right, yeah, you chose to be black just like I chose to be gay. You ain't got nothin' in common with my people, you big sinnin' ass people. Your people have never been spat on, hung, or murdered. No, your people have nothing whatsoever in common with my people! Well, ain't this some crazy white boy shit? I know what the Bible says. You people goin' straight to hell. - Seven, last five. Five, suck it in. Can I have your location, please? Oh, oh yes. Uh, sorry. Bridge Street. Five, one, five, one Bridge Street. Uh, what street was that? Bridge Street. Breesh Street? Five, one, five, one Bridge Street. Uh, um, can you repeat that? Your accent, I- I don't understand. Bridge Street. One moment, please. So, that's fifty-one, fifty-one Breesh Street. I- I- I'm sorry, that's not showing up on my system. Bridge Street. Breesh Street? Bridge Street. Breesh Street? Bridge Street. Breesh Street? Oh my God, Bridge Street. Alright? As in London fucking Bridge. B- R-I-D- G- E. Okay? We are stuck in an- in an elevator at fifty-one, fifty-one Bridge Street. Okay? Help us! One moment, please. Okay, that's fifty-one, fifty-one Bridge Street. Please don't attempt to open the doors, press any buttons. Our technicians will be there shortly. Okay, shortly, when is that exactly? Um, just a few minutes. Please relax, ma'am. Bitch, how am I supposed to relax when I'm stuck in a elevator with a- Stuck in an elevator with a... ma'am? Ma'am? I believe you are saying? Hey. Is there a problem? Uh, no, Gunther, I'm simply doing my job. I've been listening to your last few calls, and I feel really bad for these people, Trina. Quite frankly, you sound like a bitch. Is there a problem, Trina? I'm simply doing my job, Gunther. Does the fact that you get to work from the comfort of your home not mean anything to you anymore? Do you wanna come back into the office, Trina? No. I suggest you watch your tone, then. Okay, sorry. Didn't- didn't mean to have a tone. Why do you people take things so personally? This is your job. When people get upset and take it out on you, is it or is it not your responsibility to do your job to the best of your ability? Yes. Of course, yes. You need to have some compassion. You need to sound like you care. You need to be there for them. You need to save them. That is your job. How many times do I need to tell you this? I- I just don't think it's right that we get talked down to. Oh, you don't think it's right that you get talked down to? Maybe you should take it up with HR then. Perhaps they wanna hear what you have to say about being talked down to. Or, they have other people who would appreciate this job in this dismal economy. Do you want a new job, Trina? No. Then do your job! Your job is to be there for them. To save them. -Your job is to care. -I do care. Gotta go, Gunther. Is that really what you think? That I'm going to hell? Those smell good. Don't speak to me. I just don't understand how somebody with your background could be such a bigot. -It just doesn't make any sense to me. -Boy, you better stop. You're destroying those beautiful roses. You take 'em then! Damn it! Yes. Mm, feels so good. And, exhale. You know, back home when I was a boy, I used to eat a lot of oranges. Those oranges back home were the size of your head. Yeah. I used to sell them on the train to town. Every summer on Saturdays. Yeah. They were so sweet. Very sweet. Your, um, your accent, it, uh, it sounds familiar. I feel like I've heard it before. Uh, are you from Jamaica? Oh. -What, did I- -Ai-yi. You Americans are so funny. Ai. Yeah. Okay, well, then where are you from? I'm from Jamaica. Yeah, man. Jamaica, man. Kingston Jamaica, yeah. Really though? All joking aside, I am from South Africa. Oh. You been there? I was born there. Oh. But, the way you speak. You sound American. Very American, eh? Yeah. Where are these people, anyway? Hello? Hello? Reach, reach, reach, reach, reach. Ah. And release. Can I have your location please? Yeah, we're still stuck in an elevator at fifty-one, fifty-one Bridge Street. It's only been ten minutes. Someone will be there shortly. Okay, yeah, but we really need to get out, so can you please- Please relax, ma'am. They'll be there soon. See that? We are from the same country, but you, she could understand. I'm sorry, man, but I'm a Christian, and I don't wanna hear about your boyfriend and all this gay shit. Damn. You don't understand. I can't be hearing about- no, it's my- Just not the day, okay? Damn. It's just not my day, Lord. As God is my witness, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. Can I have your location, please? Um, yeah. I'm still stuck, and I'm having problems breathing. Okay, ma'am, I can send emergency. Can I have your location, please? I'm at the Mercy Building. Three, one, two, two, Carolwood Lane. Oh, my God. You're still there? One moment, please. This is dispatch at five, zero, four, two, six. We still have a woman trapped at the Mercy Building location. She has been there for some time and is having trouble breathing. Please send emergency right away. Ma'am? Ma'am, I- I'm so sorry about this. Please remain calm, stay seated, don't try to open the doors or activate the alarms. Emergency will be there shortly. Okay. Okay, please hurry. Ma'am? Ma'am? Hello? Hello, Trina. You been working on your tone? Uh, excuse me. Gunther, I have a- a woman stuck at the Mercy Building, and she's having problems breathing. Did you follow call center procedure? Yes, of course. What do you want from me, then? Um, I don't know. Send our men to her right away so the EMTs can get to her? You're sounding hostile again. I'm still not impressed with your tone. What's the problem, Trina? There's no problem, Gunther. I am just concerned about this woman. Just because you're fat and all alone doesn't mean you have the right to take it out on these poor, trapped people, or on me. I'm joking. Hilarious. No, no, no. Trina, you're a very special dispatch agent. That is why you get to work from home. You have seniority. Not all dispatch agents get to work from home. I know that. That's not wha- If you know that, then you have to watch your tone. Otherwise, do you want a new job, Trina? No. I mean, let's face it. A fat, lonely woman with a high school education. What else could you possibly do? Hilarious. Jokes, Trina, jokes. I love this joking with you. So much fun! Right? So much fun we're having together. Right? Right. I cannot be late to my meditation class tonight, Colby. I am so sorry, but you know how much it helps centers me, and, you know, connects me to a universal source, which I so need right now because this internship is like, so not what I'm supposed to be doing. I never knew that the Reiki experience could be that intense. Like, OMG, I just, I'm so more aligned with my true path than, like, ever before. ...has no clue about the deeper meaning of life. I mean, she's just so disconnected, totally ungrounded. I just, I find it hard to believe that anyone could be that, like, oblivious to the obvious universal truth. Yeah, connection. You know? I'm like, I don't know what to think about that. All is well in my world. It's funny. You know? I know it isn't funny "ha-ha," but funny that this isn't the first time that I've received roses meant for somebody else. Charlene gave 'em to me. Gave 'em back to me. I picked her up for senior prom. I was so excited I got to borrow my mom's car. My parents were so confused. I told them everything. 'Bout the rumor. How it was true. That's the last time I ever saw my parents. And the last time I received roses meant for somebody else. Until today. The roses part, I mean. I always liked roses too. Favorite flower, actually. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me! Come on, don't you have a special lady in your life? Come on. Play. It'll help kill the time. She loves me. Hm. She loves me not. She loves me. She loves me not. He did this, Angela. He made up his mind. He did this. This is his choice. Oh Lord. Mom. Please look at me. Mom. I'm so sorry. You can leave now. Get out. I'll just be in the bedroom if you need anything. Bedroom? I said get out. Get outta my house. -Angela, look, I know- -Get out! You alright? Of course. Did I ever tell you the story about my first year in college? I'm sorry, Gunther, but I'm not really in the mood to hear one of your- Fine, alright, geez. Yeah. You gotta tell me, though, why didn't you go to college? You're not very smart, right? Hilarious. Um, no, seriously, though. Tell me. Wh- why- why didn't you go to college? I didn't qualify for financial aid, and I couldn't afford it. I've told you this many times, Gunther. What do you think is going to happen when foreigners are the only ones who are rich enough to go to our top universities, Trina? Hm? What happens then? You realize that is what's happening. What's going to happen then, Trina? I- I don't know. Why are you asking me? Why are you- Maybe then everyone will be just like you. Working in a call center, from home, fat and alone, on their computers, on social sites all day, liking pictures and shit. Just like you. You're America's future, Trina. It's hilarious. Oh, I love this joking with you, Trina. Lesson for Day Five. You are here for a reason. The reason is not your job. The reason is not to eat. God didn't put you here to gain weight, to turn to blubber, to be an obese, fat pig or a victim that gets attacked. You are here for a reason. Repeat after me. I am here for a reason. I am here for a reason. Food is not the reason. Food is not the reason. You are not a victim. I am not a victim. I am a fighter, a survivor. I am here for a reason. I'm a fighter, a survivor. I'm here for a reason. All is well in my world. All is well in my world. Make sure to repeat this chant throughout the day. Remember, you are here for a reason. Where these people at, anyway? I know, right? I already missed my meeting. I think that they were gonna make me full time today too. We could really use the money. My boyfriend and I have... Yeah, well, anyway, I- I could really use the money. Where were you going with these roses, anyway? Apologize to my wife, Angela, for a fight we had weeks ago. She still won't let me come home. Women. Sorry. Fights suck. My boyfriend and I are... You said Angela? I know an Angela that works on the twelfth floor. Yeah, Angela works on the twelfth floor at that medi- I totally know her. She's my boyfriend's mother, she's Bernard's m- You claim to be South African, but you don't recognize my accent. How can you not know? I'm sure you must have heard black South Africans speak. Right? Right? Okay, my mother and I left when I was ten years old. Okay? We didn't have a choice. We had to go. Okay? No choice? Impossible. You people always have a choice. You know, a few years after Mandela became president, things in my neighborhood began to change. And not for the better, okay? For worse. You see, my father's bottle shop was getting burglarized almost every single night, and the police oftentimes wouldn't even show up for hours because these new policemen were black. You see? So, you're the piece of shit father that stopped payments on his tuition? You know he might not graduate? Do you know what he's been doing for money? Angela can't make the tuition on her own. Do you- do you have any fucking idea what this is doing to him? He's completely given up. He's lost, he- He won't even talk to me. Of course Angela won't take you back, won't take those fucking roses. She's worried sick about him. I'm worried sick! He's completely torn up about this. I can't- I can't! Fuck! We'd just returned from my ten year birthday celebration when the neighbors came to the gate and told my parents that the robbers were at it again. My dad, just being so fed up and angry, he grabbed his- his gun, and our dog, Lex, and he sped off in the car. Before my mother and I even knew what had happened, it- just- it, it happened so fast. So fast, it- My mother and I didn't know what to do, so she told me to go into my room and stay there. So, I went in my room, and I took off my brand new, pink birthday dress. And I put on my pajamas, and I brushed my teeth, and I peered out through my bedroom door, and as I watched my mother call for the police... Just nothing. I watched as she tried to fix the phone. Again nothing. It must have been after midnight when the police finally came to our gate. And I ran to the window and watched as my mother talked to the policeman. I, I saw her scream before I actually heard it. Her entire body just froze. It felt like a year before I finally heard her say "No, no." "Oh, my God, no." Daddy! Daddy. I too lost my father. At the age of ten. Special Branch. I'm so sorry. It's alright. - Seven, and six. - I'm here for a reason. Smile it out, four, and three, and two. I'm a fighter. -One. And breathe. -Fighter. Here we go. Get going. -Fighter. - Let's get those buns going. And up. Good. Feel it up. Squeeze that butt. Bathing suit butt. Lift it up. Suck it in. And ten, eleven. Good. Add the head. And go. And up. And up. Good. Squeeze. And squeeze. And pulse. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Good, let's pulse it up to the side. Get that piriformis going. And up. All of those little sags we hate out of the sides of our jeans, pulse it. And pulse it. And pulse, hold it up. Now, up, up from your high spot. Squeeze. Feel the burn. Yes, you love it! Ten more times. -Eight, seven, six, four, three, two, one. And, stretch those buns. -And release. - Hello? Alright, so where was I? Right. Who needs an education anyways? We Americans are great Olympians. Hey, maybe, maybe if you get fired, you can be an Olympian. Uh, what's your, what's your favorite sport, Trina? I don't have a favorite sport, Gunther. Trina. Gymnastics. I- I like gymnastics. Hm. Yeah. Gymnastics. But what's the one with, uh, that? - Th- that'd be- that could work. Can I have your location, please? Anybody there? Hello? Hello? Anybody there? Fuck it. Hello? Hello? Anybody there? Hello? Trina. Why do you people take things so personally? Maybe if you get fired, you can be an Olympian. Oh, yes. Oh. Oh. Mm. Oh shit. All is well in my world. I am so worried about Bernard. Look, Angela, don't you think the two of you should maybe work together to find him? You know, sometimes I don't even know why I bother to call you. Work with Leon? He's the reason we're in this situation in the first damn place! You know what? Maybe if you weren't such a shut-in, and you actually came out of your apartment, maybe you could just be useful and actually help me! Shit! All is well in my world. All is well in my world. Exhale. Drop. Breathe. You are not a victim. And down. And exhale. And down. Good, that's- we got forty. You're almost there. Now thirty-nine. And down. Thirty-eight. And down. Oh God, oh yes. I know this is hard. Ow! But you can do it, you kick ass, rockin' body babe. Can I have your location, please? Hello? -Mm, feels so good. -Damn. Where did you go? You missed another call. - Ah. Exhale. -Yeah, I- I'm sorry. Sorry about that. It's alright, just don't let it happen again. -And open up. -Okay. Ah. What is that? -Are you watching porn? -Yeah. Oh God. No. No. This is not porn. Ah! Whatever. Um, just wanted to let you know that everything went well with the Mercy Building lady, and that we're waiting on dispatch for the, uh, the- the Bridge Street order. Okay. Thanks. Did I ever, um, tell you the story about my days as a long-distance runner? I- I'm sorry, Gunther, I'm not really in the mood to hear one of your stories. Fine, fine. What do you got going on this weekend? D- do you ever go anywhere? I don't know. Nothing. W- why are you asking? Don't you think it's sad? Huh? You have nothin' going on in your life. Just this job. And your television. Watching. Watching whatever it is you're watching. It's not porn. Geez, Louise. I'm kidding. Hilarious. Did you need anything else? Best watch your tone, Trina. Hello? Come on. Hello? Oh, my God. Hello? Hello! You bitch! Do you want a new job, Trina? Maybe if you weren't such a shut in, and you actually came out of your apartment... - Bitch! -And up. You're not very smart, right? Just because you're fat and all alone... I know these bands are tight. They're tight. - Hello? Somebody please help! Hello? - So tight. Amazing. A fat, grown woman? What else could you possibly do? Best watch your tone, Trina. - Kick ass arms. Pull. Pulse it. Pull. - Somebody please help! Hit that wall and squeeze it up. And up. Last twenty. Twenty, come on, feel it. Nineteen. You missed another call. Eighteen, oh, amazing. Yes! You have nothing going on in your life. Just this job. I don't even know why I bother to call you. - You're not very smart. - - You bitch! Fat and alone. Help us! Yes, two, and one. Good. And breathe. And pulse. And down. And exhale. And down. Good, that's- we got forty. Almost there. Now thirty-nine. And thirty-eight. And release. Ease your way down. Oh. Mm. Ah. Mm. Yes. Ah, yes. Mm, feels so good. Mm. Mm. Ah! Ah. Oh. Ah. Ah, yes. Mm, so good. Ah. Ah! Yes. Oh! And five, and suck, and suck. Lesson for Day Five. - You are here for a reason. The reason is not your job. The reason is not to eat. God didn't put you here to gain weight, to turn to blubber, to be an obese, fat pig or a victim that gets attacked. Make sure to repeat this chant throughout the day. Remember, you are here for a reason. What did I tell you about handling your business? Okay. Okay, then. Are you sure? Get out. You're doing good. And six. Feel that crease and your buns. Bun- What the fuck? Wh- what the fuck do you want? What are you doing? Oh shit! Oh, shit, I'm s- I'm sorry! Sorry, I- I- I- I'm- I'm having monitor problems. I don't- I- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Yeah. Hello? Can anyone hear me? Yes, ma'am, I can hear you. Can I have your location, please? Uh, I- I- I don't know, um. I'm next to the restroom in the mall. Okay, which mall? On La Cienega. Thank you, one moment, please. Hi, this is dispatch at five, zero, four, two, six. I have a woman trapped with a child in an elevator at the Beverly Center. Uh, she's by the restrooms, doesn't know exactly where. Uh, please make rounds. Ten four. Ma'am? Uh, yeah, hello? Hi, I have security in the vicinity making rounds. Someone should be there shortly. Please be patient. Oh, oh. Thank you. How are you? What do you want? Did I ever tell you the story about my long lost love? Gunther, I'm not in the mood to hear one of your stories. I have a lady with a baby stuck. -Just listen. -Gunther! I'm not- She was a- a very sweet, sweet girl. -Gunther! -Oh, and beautiful, just beautiful. Uh, we met in college. I was studying business, and, uh, she was studying science. She, uh, um, her dream was to get into medical school. Gunther, I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood. Do you want a new job, Trina? From what Bernard has told me, I guess you weren't always a total piece of shit father. Actually, you were great. You were a great father. Bernard once told me that his fifth birthday was the happiest day of his life. You bought him his first bike. Do you remember that day? I remember. I remember because I never had a bike, and I wanted him to have one. I remember working overtime to buy him that bike. I wanted him to have all the things I never had. I wanted him to be somebody. He could've been somebody. Bernard is smart. He's hardworking, had faith, just like we raised him to be. He could've been anything. Me and Angela promised ourselves we would give him everything, so he could become anything. So his kids could b- become anything, and their kids. He went and chose to become, become a... I will never forgive him. He's the one that broke up the family and turned into the worst kind of a sinner. I don't know where I went wrong. So, um, Mr. Whatever Your Name Is, thanks for the trip down memory lane. But that child is no son of mine. Father, let me be who I- Fuck! Whoa. That's it. That's it. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck you. Oh shit. Oh. Oh. Hey dad. Yeah? Fuck you too. Man, I loved you. I fuckin' loved you, man. It's cool, though. It's cool. I don't need you, obviously. Look at me now! Look at me right fuckin' now! Oh, shit! Oh, shit. ♪ Morena boloka ♪ ♪ Setjhaba sa heso ♪ ♪ O fedise dintwa ♪ ♪ La matshwenyeh ♪ ♪ O se boloke ♪ ♪ O se boloke ♪ ♪ Setjhaba sa ♪ ♪ Heso ♪ ♪ Setjhaba sa ♪ ♪ Afrika ♪ Eh. Mm. Yeah, eh.

My parents, being in the struggle, thought it was important that I knew as many African languages as possible. Silly, really. No, not silly. You're South African. Yeah. Mm. Bretta, you're an African woman. Why do you go to these places? What places, Sipho? Uh, every day, you're speaking of, uh, meditating, cleansing. One day, you were even talking of, uh, healings. If cleansing is what you need, if healing is what you want, go home. Visit your father's grave. Pray to your ancestors. You'll be cleansed. You'll be healed. Go home. Home. Home. Where was I? Oh yeah, yeah. Um, we're supposed to meet in front of the, uh, library on campus. Um, but I got tied up in class with my professor. Um, we're discussing my major. I- I respected him, just wanted to know his opinion. Um, by the time I got to the library, it was closed. It had gotten very late, it was dark, there was no one around. So, I'm heading back to the dorms. And I hear this rustling in the bushes. No, don't touch me! Get away! Babe, it's me, it's me, wha- oh, my God. You're bleeding. What happened? Where were you? Don't touch me! Where the fuck were you? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my Go- I was supposed to be her first. I wasn't. Oh. Well, wh- what happened to her after that night? Um, she- she- she dropped out of college after that, and broke off our engagement. A year later, she called me. She wanted to see me. Um, I hardly recognized her. I mean, the attack completely changed her. She became a shut-in. She rarely left the apartment, and she gained a bunch of weight. I mean, it looked like a hundred pounds to me. But I didn't care, though. I really didn't. She was still so beautiful. She wanted to know where I was, why I was so late, and, um, why I didn't protect her. She said it was my job to protect her, and she... I didn't know what to say. I mean, I didn't save her. She's right, you know. No. You had no way of knowing. Did you tell her that? That it wasn't your fault? No. I never saw her again after that. Well, not in person, anyways. You gave up on her? You were engaged. I don't know, she just- she just didn't want anything to do with me. Anything to do with that night. I was just an awful reminder, that's what she said. An awful reminder. Do you still love her? Last I heard, she completely changed her life. I mean, complete transformation. Lost all the weight, um, became a fitness guru, or some shit. Her name was Lola. Holy shit! I don't know why I just told you all that. Oh, my God. Geez, Louise. Hilarious. What do you mean, she became a fitness guru? Last I heard, she, she got some help, lost all the weight, and I- got some DVDs or something, now. Apparently, everybody's doing her- her- her, uh, workout. I don't know. Oh. Um, you know what? Why don't you- why don't you go ahead and, uh, log off early today. We- we've- we got everything under control. Just enjoy your weekend. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That- thanks for... Yeah.

Thanks for holding. May I take your order? Yes, hi. Hey, Trina. Would you like your usual? Large pepperoni, extra cheese, side of garlic bread? - You are here for a reason. -Yes, thank you. The reason is not your job. The reason is not to eat. God didn't put you here to gain weight, to turn to blubber, to be an obese fat pig, or a victim that gets attacked. You are here for a reason. Repeat after me. I am here for a reason. God made us all in his perfection. God would never make a faggot. That kind of shit, humans made up. But God made Bernard in his perfection too. He would never choose this. Why, in- in the last year of school, would he suddenly choose to lose it all? Well, somebody chose. Yeah, the devil. The devil's got a hold of my son, Lord. Please, let him be delivered. You just gotta pray, son. He just needs the Lord, is all. Please, God. My son done turned gay and with a white boy.
