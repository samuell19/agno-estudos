Jéla! Let's go... Come on... Move... Bounce it... Great work, I want to see that at the match. Teamwork, no solos, OK? Go get ready, it's starting soon. Get back there! Let's go, Franta... -Come on, come on. -Over here, Jéla! Get back, Jéla! -Jéla, back! -That's better. Honza! Come on! Ivan, back! Come on! Back! Welcome home, how have you been? A bit bored. You know, school. No, I don't. I always liked school. Have you seen the paper? František, is that you? -What do you think will happen? -You tell me. You were at the assembly for future lawyers and politicians, right? Or weren't you? It is you! Did you get into a fight? Don't get expelled before graduation, Franta! Come on, he's been playing basketball all week, haven't you? František. What vain hope to think that anything will come of you. Dad, I don't want to lie to you, but can I really talk honestly about this with you? By judgment of the municipal court in Prague on 5.6.1942, the following people are sentenced to death by firing squad... You must take over the team, Franta. I have to take care of something. -But I can barely play. -You know that's not true. You can do it. Just always be fair. Let's go! GOLDEN STING -Thanks, Jana. -Thank you for allowing us. Oh, I'm happy to. Come here, Honza. Do you know everybody here? Dad, those are my best friends, no one's going to turn you in. OK, sorry. -Just be careful, alright? -Alright. Excuse me, what can this be? Something's on my back, you see? It's a bug, I should dare to say. And this hand of mine, alas, searches vainly with each pass, I know I look a fool this way. -Now the bug on my back crawls up and down. -Up and down! -In vain my hand does chase it all around. -All around! -Where did that bug go? -It's on your chapeau! What can I do with a bug that is back-bound? -Hurry please, catch the bug ouchy oops! -Hurry, oops! -Catch it now, I am here on tenterhooks! -Tenterhooks! -Get it off of me! -Don't yell at us, gee! Easy to say when you don't have the spooks! -Catch the bug now, hurry! -Catch the bug now, hurry! All are in a tizzy looking for the bug. Stay calm, there'll be light in a second. Here we go. Follow me, go down to the cellar. Careful on the stairs, quickly! Carefully, OK? What are you doing? What's going on? You, too, guys, come on! Honza! That goes for you too! Come on! This is our home, Dad! Once this is all over, we'll show everyone. Hi! -Hi. -Where's coach? -We'll start without him. -But he's never late. Let's keep going. There's nothing here, commissioner. -Is this all Valenta has? -Yes, that's all. Let's go! You have one minute to give us the names and addresses of the people who are hiding the transmitter. You want to save them, don't you? Now what? The war's over. And it sure didn't end quickly. No it didn't. Why not? We just want a little soil. For a keepsake. -It's very important for us. -Certainly not, go away! Gentlemen, please. You are Czechs too. I have already told you, I cannot let you in. Fine then. -What are you doing? -Go, go...! Finance and personnel departments were to submit a list of current employment relationships to the ministry by the 1st of October. Why isn't it on my desk? Who didn't submit it? It is all taken care of, Minister, you will have it this afternoon. I hope so. -Continue. -Thank you. Gentlemen! Law no. 112 on prison and penal institution administration gives the ministry jurisdiction over these facilities. Our task today is to decide on a specific policy and distribute responsibilities. If you will allow me, Minister... Wait. You should be grateful you finished school, you know? I wanted to help you and you're only embarrassing me. You're acting like an entitled little brat. Can you imagine how ridiculous I feel? You can't even put together a list of subordinates! I never asked for this. You wanted me to work here. I don't like it and I can't pretend I do. What do you like? Chasing a ball? You think that will earn you a living? There's no point to keep defending myself. You'll never get it. You know what? I'm not going keep you here. Just quit, OK? I wanted to anyway. Get out. Get out! I'll have grapes. And chocolate... -Two! -Yeah. Shall we? Looking nice, ladies. -You play basketball too? -Yes, I play center. This is František, our coach. -Good evening. -Good evening. I'm sure it will be. I won't disturb you. Have a nice evening. Can I get you anything? Hey, there's John! Trusil, who coached the Mormons. I'm going to say hello. I'm glad to meet Jarda's replacement. -He can't be replaced. -How are you doing? -I expect it's hard, isn't it? -For sure. I hope to see you play in Geneva, I'm so curious about your style. If we can raise the money. It's like pulling teeth. Any chance of getting a medal? I hope so. He said he's looking forward to seeing us in Geneva. Gentlemen... -Good evening, Miss. -Good evening. Well, Franta, are we going to Geneva? It's not for sure yet. Hrabal is working on it. He's the new chairman. All taken care of! It's all taken care of, I've got the money. So I officially welcome you to the meeting for representatives. We're going to Geneva thanks to a loan from Kábrt Senior, Pepa's dad. I'll be in charge of the trip. This is the approved nomination. Not even the reporters have seen it. The player-coach, that's clear, it's Franta here. Karásek, Jelen, Kábrt, Válek, Žižka. Slovaks: Lisický, Havran a... Jan Sedlák. Thank you. Now we have the formalities out of the way. Hey, guys... For starters, everyone takes ten free throws. -Keep your fingers crossed. -I will. -Try to bring something back, OK? -What do you mean? Like gold, right? Or are you going there for something else? Here... Excuse us, representatives on their way! -Jelen, sit down. -Yeah, OK. -We're on our way, guys! -On our way! On our way! Don't yell so much. Do you think we'll have a view of Lake Geneva? How are the girls there? Chubby. They were well-off during the war, weren't they? The Swiss trained the whole war. They never were much good anyway. I'm more afraid of the Italians. You take yourselves too seriously. It'll be an altogether different league over there. May I...? The fourth estate, what a life! -While we get screwed, right? -That's harassment, isn't it? I have to get out, I need to pee. -Don't think you can. -What should I do? There's a window and the train isn't in the station. That's it, gentlemen. Who's dealing? -He can't be serious. -I'll wait for the tunnel. So how was it? Upwind. Well, I'll be damned! Guys! Come taste these oranges, gentlemen! That's alright. Next time! -Thanks! -You're welcome! No, it's a half hour away. We'll save some money and walk. Come on, let's go! -Finally! -Is this it? It was cheap, stop complaining. -What a hole. -Jelen sleeps on the scaffolding. They're renovating so I got a discount. -Welcome, gentlemen. -Goodbye. So, six rooms... If mom saw this! I believe we're in for a week of unforgettable experiences. What do you think they'll be like? I mean the experiences. Guys, I will make personally certain no one here gets too distracted. There's one room with a shower. So Prokeš and Sedlák. -That's what I call class society. -Don't provoke, comrade. Guys! For the common treasury! -From one of Baťa's factory workers. -From a former clerk. -From an eternal student. -And I'm going to manage a bank. Who didn't get a key? Come on, let's get settled. Guys, the rooms smell so good! And the little red lights are also a nice touch. Come on, girls, go clean up the rooms, please. Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen. And bon appétit. Quite a gal, isn't she? This is so good, guys. It tastes so different from home. What a difference from Dad's cooking. -Want the cherry? -No. Leave that alone. What's going on here? -Bedtime! Honza, in your room. -I'll be waiting for you, coach. Bedtime. Good night. Wait for tomorrow! It'll be an altogether different league. Good night. Good night. Hold this here for me. -Don't worry, we can't lose in these. -Hope you're right! Remember what coach Valenta said? The games make the team. This box holds soil from the Pankrác prison. He died there. Today, I want us to play as we promised we would. For those who should be here. For Jarda Valenta. -For our boys. -Jirka and Rudla, our Jewish boys. Let's do this! Holario! -What are you doing? -What are you yelling? I don't know. But I have the feeling we should yell something. OK, let's go for it. Let's do this, guys. -One, two, three! -Holario! Let's go! Mormon! Come on Jéla, run! That was yours, Jéla! Go! Žižka for Jéla! Pepa Žižka! Subbing for Jéla! -Stay glued to number sixteen! -Careful, he's fast. Foul! Careful, guys, seven seconds to halftime! Anybody want water? Let's go. -I should have made that! -No, you made one. No one's making many shots. So it's OK. Number six! Jéla! Time out! We have to double up more on defense, got it? After the first pass. Let's go! Holario! Come on, Žižka! Run! Sub! The final seconds now. Žižka gives it to Honza. You dribble, don't let them at it. You help him, Ivan, OK? Let's go! Champagne? Guys! 1, 2, 3! Holario! -Let's drink to that! -Never drink alone! Cheers! You have to come to the game tomorrow, girls, you bring us luck! You can have three glasses, we're in for a hard day tomorrow. -The fun's only getting started! -30 more minutes! Sorry for interrupting, I'll leave you alone. You speak French. That's a surprise. Why? I can play with you if you want. You probably wouldn't enjoy that. Probably not. I heard you've got a big day tomorrow. Yes. You didn't bring any fans along? No one believes in us much. Well, good luck. The European Basketball Championship Finals are kicking off in Geneva. After three victories in less than a week, our boys are going for gold. It's down to the final minutes of the game. Italy is on offense. Stefanini has the ball, careful, he's faking! He makes the shot. We're losing 29 to 31, but that's OK. We have the ball! They pass the ball up the court. He goes in... Lisický has the ball, he shoots... Foul! You have three shots, they got a Tech a too! Dear God, he's not going to make it! -He's not going to make it! -Stop it, he will! He sinks the first one! Now he's getting ready for the second free throw. Basket! It's a basket! And the third one? He makes it! That is unbelievable! 56 seconds to go and we're ahead by one point! Italy has the ball, this is dangerous territory! -Stefanini, Vanini... -Foul! But it wasn't a shooting foul, so Italy only gets one free throw. -And it's in! -Time out! They think I'll have the ball but we'll do what we did to the Swiss. Pass the ball to Honza. How's your arm? You OK? -Of course. -Come and sit down, Jéla. 1, 2, 3! Let's go! We have the ball with 15 seconds to the end. It's now or never. Italian defense is going to be tight. Lisický has the ball. Pass the ball, there isn't time! Pass to Karásek, two Italian are on him. Karásek fakes and shoots... It's in! The refs are signaling the end! It's unbelievable, we're the Champions! The Czechoslovaks have done it! You have made history! Bravo! Please, Miss... Gentlemen, can you tell us how you prepared for the finals with Italy? We tried to prepare for each Italian player separately. We got up at half past four and went for a run and then sat down to a three-course English breakfast. What's your training plan? Yes, we practiced ten basic signals. You said your strategy was that you don't have a strategy. We realized no one could remember the signals, so we decided to just make more baskets. Well, congratulations on your win. František! My man! -You played great, congratulations. -Thanks. I hope it's not just a dream I will soon wake up from. But it's the dream of all great players to play in America, right? That's for sure. When will you come visit me to see how it's done across the pond? Someday for sure, but I've got a lot of work here with the guys. Perhaps in two, three years. After the London Olympics. Are you going? You bet I am, František. But then I'll see you in America. Well, good luck. And don't forget, the door is always open to you. -I've always believed in you, boys. -And why wouldn't you! We just had to win with the whole brothel cheering for us. -Thanks. -Not for you, careful. Thigh... ...with an actor called Werish. Do you know him? I don't understand you, but it sounds beautiful. Someone has come to see you. Wait, don't go. I didn't want to interrupt. But you did anyway. You're a real weirdo. What are you doing? You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I guess you haven't seen too many. You know how in the train we were looking at the war... I said to myself, we're going to die. -Of course, but everyone knows that. -I know. But not today, Honza. I miss her so much. Do you work here as a... I'm not a hooker. I wash dishes and help out in the kitchen. Are you disappointed? Do you like art? I'm a dancer. I studied ballet, but I couldn't finish because of the war. Is that why you're here? I fled to Paris from Stalin. I'm from a Polish Jewish family. They all stayed there. Now I have no one left. And when Hitler invaded France, I came here. I have work and food. But the world is your oyster. You're European Champions. That's true... But is it really so important? I don't know. But I liked the game. I could tell you live for it. It was like you were dancing. Stand still. Leave me alone. I'm not Melanie. -You are so beautiful. -You too. And you are too. -Do you know where Michelle is? -I haven't seen her all morning. -Me either. -Forget her, they're all the same. -You never know. -Sure. Excellent job! Congratulations, guys. You're great. There's my boy! -I've longed for this all Geneva. -There are your parents. Great job! František! Hi! -Congratulations! -I brought you gold, Mom. Mom... and I congratulate you. Make it a good one. You're photographing history! Smile! -You have Geneva on the line. -Yes. Thank you. -You have a phone call. -There's no one to call me. Hello? You still washing dishes? You didn't come to say goodbye. I don't know how to say goodbye. I'm going to call you every day till you come. There's really no point. Michelle... I miss you, you know? I know. How do you know? Because I miss you too. It looks very nice on you. I'm glad. It's a very beautiful present, thank you. I only hire Bětka to help out during the holidays. I don't manage to clean up the whole place. It's a big house. And all the cooking... -Can you translate that? -That's not necessary, Mom. Bon appétite. -Thank you for inviting us over. -We are so delighted. I'm very glad we are all together. I guess she doesn't like it. Should I give her Schnitzel now? Do you want Schnitzel? This is fish soup. Mom is anxious you don't like it. Tell her I love fish. Michelle says she loves fish. Thank God! Calm down, Mommy. How long will you be staying with us? As long as she wishes, Dad. I wanted to suggest the same. Thank you so much for the invitation. I haven't felt so well in a long time. And thank you for this lovely touch. You don't need to translate that. I always wished I'd had a daughter too, even though it sounds a bit cliché. I like how happy František is next to you. I can tell. There, it went fast, there's nothing left. So we are... Finished! Yes. You should have told me you have such great parents. Wait, so you aren't here just because of me? Well sorry, I guess I'll go sleep in the guest room. Silly, you know what I mean. And don't laugh at me for being afraid. I'm quite a bit older than you and I know how people take that. I haven't a penny to my name, you have a villa, a car, a maid... That's not important at all. Tell me something about your life in Lviv. I feel like you know all about me, but I still know nothing about you. We were well off. A bit like you. We often went to the theater and the cinema. We had lots of friends. And then the war started, my parents were worried the Red Army would invade. They sent me to some acquaintances in Paris. They intended to follow afterwards but... That's enough... Don't turn the light off, please. I'm scared of the dark. Good night, sweetheart. I couldn't sleep. -Hello. -Hello. How can I be of service? It keeps losing time. And I don't like getting rid of old things. I'll just have a look. Would you like some tea, Mr. Minister? Yes, we would, wouldn't we? Don't call me minister. You read the paper, don't you? This is the end. Dad, is something wrong? Water... water! I'll just sit down for a bit, OK? I have to go. You won't change your mind? You should come with me. Take your parents and we could all live in Paris. Dad is a patriot. He'd never leave Czechoslovakia. Leaving here would kill him. Staying here will kill him for sure. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I've already lost one family... I understand you. Come on, back! -Where were you? -Sorry, the meeting went long. Your meetings are going to send this whole place to hell. -Leave me alone. -So? How many decent people have you disposed of today? Ten? Twenty? -How is it to ruin someone's life? -I'm not ruining anyone. It's for a common cause! Enough! Don't bring politics here. This was the last time, next time don't be late, understood? Go get dressed. State police. Wake your husband up. We need to speak with him. What is it you wish, gentlemen? We've come to make sure you are doing well. Some of your former colleagues are not doing so well, you know? You didn't appear on election day... That's no reason to annoy us at such an early hour. No. Some discrepancies were discovered from your time at the ministry. Explain your relationship to the People's Democratic Government. Please, gentlemen, I am at your service. -We'll speak about it at our place. -No, you can see he's ill! -You don't have much time. -I understand. -Goodbye, comrade. -Goodbye. It's a heap of trouble with your father. I hope we can resolve it. If he did nothing, all will soon be explained. -You know something about him? -Hope they won't take your passport. You're team captain after all. Don't worry, I won't leave you in this. Guys! Only the best can go to the Olympics in London. Old achievements mean nothing, it's skill that counts. And the character of the representatives. -We have character, don't we? -That remains to be seen. A lot has changed. Backing by the leadership must be deserved. And reciprocated. Since many of you don't understand what is actually going on, I've decided for all of us, for the team. I've sent a congratulatory telegram to Comrade Gottwald for his election as president of the Czechoslovak Republic. -You're an idiot! -Who do you think you are, shithead? I cut myself to pieces to get us somewhere, and this is what I get? You have no clue. Fuck off! Don't worry about that, just concentrate on the game. Thanks for your support, coach. Are you OK? -Honza? -What's wrong? Does it hurt? -Your ankle? -I think so. -Shit! -Why did you play so hard? -Don't yell, I did what you wanted. If it's broken, you'll do no more than dream about London. -How we'll manage without you? -Don't tell me. I'm messed up. At least you'll be there. Look what we've achieved with you. Valenta was right about everything. He believed in you. The guys believe in you, I believe in you. You have to go, Trusil is going to be there. Guys, who didn't get a key from me? -I wonder what will be for supper. -Me too. I'm starving. A three-course supper. Fellas... Can you put this in my room? I have to go see Michelle. Send her our greetings. -I hope she's coming to the game. -Me too. Hope you get back alright, London is pretty big. Kábrt has them. Pepa, keys from number five! -Do you have them? -Yes. Thanks for making time for me. How is it in Prague, František? It's awful. The communists have spread everywhere. People are beaten and jailed without reason. No one knows what to expect. I can't believe it. Beneš let us down so much. How's your father, is he OK? He was in custody for two weeks, but they released him in the end. He's not well, he has a heart condition. Does your offer still stand? -The door is always open to you. -Thank you. I have to go. I'll leave a message here for you in a few days. Awful! We were scared of them like little boys, always a step behind! -Franta, but... -Are you telling me you tried? Franta's right, everyone wanted to save the day himself. -We should practice free throws. -Yes! -Do what coach here says! -Calm down, Franta, are you crazy? Go shower, then we'll talk about it. Are you OK? Are you deaf? Shower! I was mean to them. I should apologize. You don't know how to lose. But I like that. You seem even more beautiful. How is that even possible? That's my secret. But you have one too, don't you? Who was that man in the hotel? You don't have to tell me. He's a friend from America. He offered me... I could play there. Franta, that's wonderful! That would be a dream come true! And if I accept the offer, will we go there together? When? As soon as possible. But I finally got the scholarship, you know? It was so much work. I know. But couldn't it be postponed? It's like with you and basketball. I have no idea what to do. I don't want to leave home, but I want to live differently. I want my parents to be happy, and us too. We can't make that work, can we? -Why didn't he sleep here? -The coach can sleep where he wants. I don't believe it! -Where the hell were you? -Sorry, I got a bit lost. -Ivan, I wanted to say sorry. -That's OK. At least you're here. I'm glad you're home. I thought I'd bring you another medal. That doesn't matter. Come and tell us about it. Hey. -It didn't turn out so well, did it? -That's for sure. You know, you didn't have me there. -Hi Dad, are you better? -Yes, yes. So we screwed it up right in the quarterfinals. We could have played for a medal and not be in seventh place. -You did what you could. -It's only a sport. Did you have time to go anywhere? Did you see Tower Bridge? Dad, it wasn't a sightseeing trip, it was the Olympic Games. I know. What about Michelle? Did you meet? Yes. How is she? I'll get it. It's remarkable you got so far. It must have been hard to go up against the Americans. Like playing football with Brazil. This way, please. We don't want to keep you for long, we would just like to know if you didn't happen to meet... John Trusil? He came by to say hello after we played with the Americans. -Why are you asking about him? -Leave the asking to us, Mr. Prokeš. How well do you know each other? Not well at all. He was a friend of our coach, Valenta, who died during the war. So you don't care he's an agent of the CIA? John Trusil? An agent? You're kidding, right? We know very well you met him at the Astoria hotel. What did Trusil want from you? To take you to America? Why didn't you go? My family is here. And your father? Such an admirer of capitalism? You don't think... My father has nothing to do with Trusil! You could help your father. Yourself too, if you're sensible. Your dad needs a better doctor. For his heart, am I right? I won't allow you to blackmail me. No one is blackmailing you yet, you know? You still have friends, Franta. Otherwise you wouldn't be sitting here. If you don't want to go back there, you have to adapt. That's just how it is now, even your father understands that. You don't hold a candle to my... You're upset, I understand, but I had a lot of work getting you out. You have another chance, thanks to me. So don't screw it up with nonsense talk. Valenta wanted me to coach the team. You can coach. But it won't be for free. As I've said, that's how it goes now. Wait a moment. Jelen! Remember: only what we arranged, no improvisation. Otherwise we're out of the Euro Championships. Come with me, please. Comrade chairman, the athletes are here. See them in. Hello, comrades! -Come in, don't be shy. -Hello... I see that in addition to sports, you're interested in modern art. That would be quite an addition to the Louvre. That is a good point! Perhaps comrade Picasso will paint them something similar. But you haven't come to debate art. Comrade basketball players, comrade Hrabal here has assured me you have all the expedients for success at the Championships. -Yes, comrade Zápotocký. -Good. The Soviet players are going to Paris, that is why the Central Committee has decided you will go too. Comrade Hrabal proposed you write a pledge as to how you will play. That is absolutely correct. Goodbye, comrades! -Goodbye! -Goodbye! And comrades... We keep our pledges! Of course. Comrades, factory workers take pledges, as do workers in collectives farms, athletes can't stand by the wayside. In your pledge, write what results and improvements you will achieve. -Thank you... -That's not all. -You must have two workers on your team. -But we want to win. Don't tell me workers do not play basketball. There will be a worker-basketball player around somewhere. Besides, it's obligatory. -Goodbye, comrades! -Goodbye! -I'd like to know... -Shut up! We have to write it, otherwise we'd be betraying Hrabal. Betraying a betrayer. Sounds right. Cut it out. If Hrabal promised, we aren't going without a pledge. -Remember the hockey players. -I don't think it's that hopeless. The Soviets want us to face the imperialists with them, right? Well? I don't know, you heard for yourselves. No pledge, no championship. We pledge to jump higher and shoot better. And come in second behind the undefeatable USSR. -That's going a bit far, isn't it? -It's just a joke. -Only the commies won't get it. -Sign it. We promised. Bullshit, Pepa. Hrabal promised, not us. -Do what you have to. -I wouldn't take it so seriously. It doesn't mean a thing and without the pledge, we won't get visas. That's him. Thank you. -Hi! -Hi! -You are Jarda Neděla? -What? Yeah. You played basketball for Kladno before the war. -I was sixteen. -Want to give it another try? Don't have players for the league? We do, but not for the European Championships. If you want to screw around, get a hooker, not me! We're in no mood to joke. We need someone for the heavy lifting. -And you are... -What? The perfect shape and cadre! A song from the groom! Wanna dance with the best man? -You've not smiled this way in ages. -Today there's a reason. -Tell me. -No. -Tell me. -I can't tell you, I can't. Let's go for a shot. Say goodnight, stars are blazing, for you I sing my song tonight. Adios till day's breaking, Too soon it will be broad daylight. I remember at slumber's start, And I know to you alone I can give my heart. Say goodnight, stars are blazing. Around us it is dark, it's time to sleep. Ah, the chief! Brought the line-up from Tony Zápotocký himself. I came to congratulate the groom. Václav, comrade, I have a task for you from the Party. I want to stay in a brothel again at the Championships. We'll enjoy the hookers, right? Don't touch me! -Holario! Know what that means? -Cut it out. -Leave me alone. -Know what that means? -Comrade Hrabal already forgot. -Knock it off, this is a wedding! You fucked it up. It was decided we go to Paris, we're going to Paris! -The Party won't change its mind. -It certainly won't. I'll take care of your nomination. That is my responsibility. You're responsible for the others. You will write evaluations. And of course you will write that Jelen cannot go to represent. Don't want that from me. You want to kick him out for getting drunk? He has no discipline. You should see that as a coach. -Valenta would have understood. -You don't even say his name! -Who do you think you are? -I won't be a rat. Ever. A rat? -Are you saying I'm a rat? -You answer that yourself. You haven't won a thing, you're losing your chance. The team is well prepared. We're in a difficult group, but I believe we'll advance. Only the fittest players are going. Excuse me, we have to go. Good luck. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, I'm coming to you from Paris where basketball players from Czechoslovakia will go up against the undefeated USSR at the 7th European Championship finals. Our team has continued to improve. In the semifinals, they claimed victory over the home team, France, thanks to Karásek and Sedlák. Holario, Franta. Holario! The Soviet National Team enters the court greeted by wild cheers from the crowded stadium. Honza, Ivan, both Pepas and Vojta are in the starting line-up. Change, guys, Jarda's playing. You take number twelve, Korkia. -Don't let him under the basket. -In Kladno we used to say: -Can't hold out, take 'em out. -We're playing the USSR! These are the European Championship finals. -And we're going to win. -Stay out of this, comrade. Careful, Jarda, Korkia! Pepa, take the shot! The Soviets have the ball and Lyssov takes it down the court. Hang on! Sedlák has stolen the ball and goes on the offensive. Come on. Back! Válek! Stay on Karásek! I said stay on Karásek! Ivan, you're good. The score is even. Quite an end to the first half. The Soviet coach is sorry his players had such poor defense and is trying to explain their mistake to them. There's been a little misunderstanding, both teams are trying to resolve it as a group. Just before the end, the game is undecided, we have got the ball. Sedlák has it, passes to Žižka who gives it back to Sedlák. Sedlák shoots... a wasted chance! Korkia falls to the floor, but the final whistle has ended the match. The ref has called a foul for Korkia, that means the Soviets get one post-game penalty shot. Friends, it may seem unbelievable, but these finals could in the end be decided by a single penalty shot. Over the line! Over the line. They're going to huddle. Where's the problem? Perhaps they are discussing the final basket but... What protest? We will never protest the Soviet Union. Thank you, comrade Hrabal. Shameful! Boo! Please, Maruška... -Play the Czechoslovak anthem! -Excuse me? On the hills blue forests dreaming Flowery wolds Spring's happy skies... Where God self to man had spoken Gentle be, but never broken Ever cheerful, hopeful, strong Bravely thwarting any wrong There's the land of manly honor Czechia, my fatherland! Czechia, my fatherland!
