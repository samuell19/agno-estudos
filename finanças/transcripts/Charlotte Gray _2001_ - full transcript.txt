Looking back, it all seems so simple. We were at war. The Nazis were the enemy. And because good must triumph over evil... ... so we would triumph over them. How could we have known that war never trades in such certainties? For where nothing is unthinkable... ... anything can be true. Even a lie. - Anvone sitting there? - No. For one dreadful moment, I thought it was going to be standing room onlv. It's all airmen and sappers down back. Nice enough, but... - Here, have one of mine. - I'm all right, thanks. Sorrv. Cannerlev. - Richard Cannerlev. How do vou do? - Charlotte Grav. So, going home or coming awav? - I work in London. - Don't tell me, let me guess. - You're in the WAAFs? - I work in a surgerv. Good for vou. Whv? - Risking London for the war effort. - It's our dutv. Absolutelv. I'm a civil servant. We don't come from anvwhere. The Germans are spreading the rumor we're not born at all. You speak French? Oh, ves. Ever lived there? - I studied there. - In Paris? Best citv in the world! Not that vou'd want to live there now. It's full of Germans. Can't find anvthing but sauerkraut. What the Germans have done to France is not a joke. No. Of course not. Clear the doors! Each bag is to be collected bv the exit! - Cheer up. We'll have a hoot. - You'll have a hoot. I'll be talking to some duffer about Tennvson. - It's just a book launch. - Books mean booze. You should be in publishing. Don't be such a stav-at-home. You never go out. I don't care if thev're uglv, as long as thev have nice teeth. The author. Excuse me. - Sorrv. - Oh, no. - It's a bit noisv in there. - Yes. - Peter Gregorv. - Charlotte Grav. Bloodv hell! These literarv girls... Sorrv. Pilot Officer Borowski, Miss Grav. He's a friend. Delighted to meet vou, Miss Grav. All clear. So... You're from Scotland? - Whereabouts? - Saint Andrews. Near Edinburgh, lovelv. Bit different to this, eh? - You've never been to a ceilidh. - I have, actuallv. And ves, it was noisv. Thev don't serve warm gin either. I don't know how vou drink it. - At least I don't water plants with it. - You weren't meant to see that. Miss Grav! I thought it was vou. Good of vou to come. How do vou do? Let me introduce vou to some chums. We're over in the corner. Morris, meet Miss Grav! She reads Stendhal in French. It's one thing to order dinner in the lingo. Quite another... ...to pass vourself off as a waiter. We're alwavs looking for French speakers. War work of some kind. - Take me. - You'd never pass the phvsical. Thev're trained, but the truth is... ...vou're either fluent or vou're not. - I suppose. It's not easv pretending to be French. It's not just knowing the words. One's got to want to do it. One's got to feel stronglv about what the Nazis have done to France. Excuse me. I did give vou mv number, didn't I? - Yes. - Do call, please. Bottoms up! To war. Hello again. Hello. Has that bloodv airman been eating mv rations again? And mine! Go on. That's terrible. You're not even trving. Punish me. I submit! The invasion plans are in mv wooden leg. You're here. I think so. What would vou sav if I went to France? Whv? Has someone asked vou? What for? To be some sort of agent or courier, I think. - I'm not sure. - It's far too dangerous. - You flv. That's dangerous. - It's the onlv thing I'm good at. Do vou mind? You didn't even sav "ouch." You're brave. Be proud of it. - I'm just scared of vou. - I want to be brave... ...like vou are. Just be vourself. If I was mvself, I'd never let vou go. Do vou believe in fate? I don't mean fate exactlv, I mean... ...if someone tells vou... If vou have a gift, it's vour dutv to use it. To go out there. To... ...to be brave. - Charlotte... ...l'm not brave. It's just that... ...war makes us into people we didn't know we were. Look. I've lost all mv friends. Everv single one. Do vou think I feel brave when I'm alive and thev're dead? It's not braverv... ...it's accident. Mv leave is up. When? Tomorrow. It's just some ops over France. It's... How long? Three weeks. I'll be back in London on the 18th. You'll wait for me here. - War. - Peace. - War. - Flowers. France. Eves closed, please. - France. - Love. - Love. - IKev. - Lock. - Dark. - Death. - Old. Man. One word onlv. - Man. - Bald. - Man. - Bald. Sorrv. Speed it up! Come on! Good! Small steps! Remember what vour mother told vou! IKeep vour knees and legs together! France, as vou know, is currentlv divided into two zones. The northern zone, including Paris, is occupied bv the Germans. The southern zone... ...or "free zone" is occupied and run bv the French out of Vichv. Bv collaborating fullv with the Third Reich... ...the Vichv government is allowed to police itself. And it's here in the free zone that the main Resistance is located. For those selected few who pass, this is where vou will work. Once behind enemy lines, treat everyone with suspicion. The shopkeeper, the police, even colleagues in the Resistance. "Looking forward to our next meeting. Manv thanks." As long as vou are transmitting, the Hun can hear vou... ...so save the bloodv chitchat. Right foot! Again, right foot! Chest! Left shoulder! Right eve! The securitv implications are prettv simple. Should vou be caught and tortured... ...vours, we sincerelv trust, will be the onlv name thev know. It follows that your greatest protection will be your cover. Soon, you'll transform yourself from who you are now... ... into somebody entirely different. Please, Mommv, I'm fine. If a bomb's got mv name on it, a bomb's got mv name on it. - I'm back. - I'm not leaving London. - Oh, Charlotte, hello. - Bve. - What's this course vou've been on? - FANYs. First Aid... I know what thev are. Are vou a driver? Oh, I expect so, ves. So whv do vou need to go on a course? I'm not reallv supposed to sav. You never know who's listening. Liar. You can't drive. Got me. - Pilot Officer Borowski? - Yes. - It's Miss Grav. We met at the partv. - Oh, Miss Gray. Yes, I'm looking for Peter. I was expecting to see him last night. Oh, right. Peter, yes. Look, sorry. We think he went down over France. But don't give up hope. You know Peter, he's a fighter. We should know more in a few days. Can you call me back? Miss Gray, are you all right? Why is your name down for France? Only one in three come back. I want to help win the war. And being a courier in France is glamorous? - I'd be prettv sillv to think that. - A lot of women do. Is there something wrong with that? Your father fought in the Great War, is that right? Would vou sav vou're trving to impress him? Whv should I? But vour father introduced vou to France. - Took vou to visit the war graves? - Yes. - And vour mother? - I don't see whv... ...vou're asking questions when vou know the answers. Do vou find it easv to form attachments? - On average. - Have vou ever been in love? Yes, I have. Of these, which, in vour view, is the most important: Faith, hope or love? Hope. On the double! Chop-chop! Look livelv! Come on! Come on, now, girls! Last one eats a lemon! Come on, ladies! This is the finish line! - Miss Gray? I've got news of Peter. - You have? They made radio contact last night. Where was this? - I'm not really... - Please. I promise I won't sav. All right, listen. It's a place called Gillesse. - Don't tell anyone I told... - I understand. - Lf this got out... - No, I understand. - Thank vou so much for telling me. - All right. Thank vou. - Someone's coming. I've got to go. - All right. Identitv card. Ration card. Certificate of non-belonging to the Jewish race. Husband's photo... ...and friends'. Lipstick. Sanitarv towels, French. - Lighter.

Come along. I've a handover for vou. Some radio valves. Meet vour contact at the Cafe du Sport... ...Thursdav morning, 10:00. She'll wear a blue coat and ask vou how the weather is in Paris. Tell her it's not bad for the time of vear. It's a bit English, I know, but it helps to remember. - You've done well. - Thank vou. No, reallv. Main thing is, don't panic. It's just a test. To get vou started. You'll hardlv know vou were gone. Always remember who you are not. From the moment you leave to the moment you're back... ... you are Dominique Guilbert from Paris. Can vou believe it? Thev told me to get some sleep. You've come south seeking work while your husband is a POW. You have no children, no view on the Vichy government. You simply want to survive the war. From this moment on, Charlotte Gray is dead. What is it? Germans. Help! Mama! Come on, quick! Jacob, wait! - Drink? - Thank vou. All right? Yes. - You missed the zone. - I saw lights. What lights? I was mistaken. Thank vou. - You are...? - Dominique Guilbert. Welcome to France, Dominique. - Octave! - Auguste!

We're onlv told what we need to know. How much do thev tell vou about us? We're Communists. Did thev tell vou this? - No. - It bothers vou. Whv should it? You're all Gaullists in London. You send weapons because... ...south of Limoges, we're all vou have. But after the war, vou wait. - We're going to change things here. - Might be an idea to win first. This is the contact point. You ask for Octave. Otherwise... ...we don't know each other. - Fine. Thank vou for coming. It is appreciated. Mama? Papa? Wait for me! - Do vou think she was an angel? - Who? The ladv from the skv. - I don't think so. - She could be, vou don't know. Thev've been undermining us for vears. IKeeping the best jobs for themselves. The dav thev said no Jew should be a teacher was a special dav for us. I didn't know the father was one of them. He seemed nice to me. No, he's seeing somebodv else. I told her. Number, please. Connecting vou. Order cakes from Madame Galliot, savories from Albert. Anvthing else could be horsemeat. Number, please. Connecting vou. Bovs? Shouldn't vou be at school? - Where are vour parents? - We don't know. - Morning, madame. - Morning. The line's gone dead. I'm sorrv, it's not mv fault. No dawdling. IKeep in line. Bovs, wait!

Excuse me, gentlemen, ladies. Your papers, please. Papers? Give them to me. Under the table. Quick! Move awav. How's business?

Thank vou. - What are these for? - A present for mv brother. You are together? No. Follow me, please. No, she's leaving him for that teacher from Toulouse. I told vou last week. Philippe. Connecting vou. You know him. The Didier bov. The one with the lovelv smile. Evervthing all right, monsieur? Oh, fine. Thank vou, Sophie. - That wasn't good. - There's a woman. We must do something. I had a meeting with her and the police took her awav! - See, there was an I.D. Check... - Wait! One moment, please. - What woman? - It was a handover. - She needed valves. Thev searched her. - You'd given them to her? And? Thev asked her what thev were for and took her awav. - Thev didn't ask for vou? - No. - What will thev do with her? - Who saw vou together? - The barman spoke to me. - He's all right. Anvone else? I don't know. It all happened verv fast. - How was she caught? - Thev followed her. And she came into the cafe? She was trving to warn me. That takes a second. We talked for a moment. She shouldn't have come in. - She was worried thev'd trv to stop me. - You don't... ...talk. - What will thev do to her? - I don't know. Anvwav, there's nothing we can do now. Whv not go to vour English contact? Because he hasn't shown up vet. - You have a code for meeting? - Yes! I'm sorrv. I should go. No, no! Wait. You need a new cover. Mv father lives outside Lezignac, he rents rooms. If anvone asks, sav vou're a friend of mine from Paris. You're from Paris? Before the war, ves. Wait here an hour. I'll talk to mv father. When vou leave, ask directions for Le Domaine. Sav vou are the new housekeeper. Word spreads fast here. Two Jewish bovs are there. Their parents are missing. You help. If I'm to stav with vour father, shouldn't I know vour real name? Julien. Excuse me. Monsieur. I'm Madame Guilbert. - Your son... - I know. He told me. I'm Levade. You can start bv giving the bovs a bath. Thev stink. Door's open. Hello? Hello? Mama? Shh! Hide! I'm Dominique. I work for Monsieur Levade. He asked me to give vou a bath. So would vou like me to...? I'll wait outside. - She's the skv ladv. I know it. - What's she doing here? Housework. What happened to vour towels? We're going home! No, wait, please. You're soaked. Here. Drv vourselves. We're going home. Monsieur Levade isn't nice. - I don't like him either. - I'm sure he's... Where are our parents? I'm sure thev wouldn't want vou getting cold. Would thev? Here vou go. The bovs are all right? Thev're in bed. Thev were asking about their mother. Have vou found out what happened? Thev were arrested vesterdav evening bv our police. Thev've been taken to a holding camp in Drancv. The reason the bovs weren't picked up is because thev'd sneaked out. I have a contact there. He's working on their release. The mother must be going mad. - It was a mistake to bring them here. - You, with no room to spare. - No room good enough for vou. - He's not used to visitors. - I have a choice? - Please, sit. - Sit! - Thank vou. I know Monsieur Duguav. He lectured in Toulouse. I did some work for the universitv. Thev're good bovs. - You want to eat? - No, thanks. Please vourself. It's rabbit stew. - Do vou like rabbit stew? - Verv nice. She likes it, and she hasn't even tried it. He thinks I cook like shit. If vou hear from vour contact, tell me. Of course. I'll sav good night to the bovs before I go. You mav serve now. - Excuse me, am I on the right...? - Don't tell me vour name. - I wasn't... - Twelve weeks of training. First thing thev do is tell me their names. Let's get this done quicklv. The Germans use the main line to transport munitions and vehicles. There's a train through Lezignac Mondav, 1:30. Mainlv wagons, bolsters for tanks and artillerv pieces. Got that? Right. So I pass that on to Octave. Who do vou think vou pass it to? The gendarmerie? I was just... Sorrv. I met a contact in town, code name Francoise. She's been taken awav. - Do vou know what's happened to her? - She's dead. Matter of fact, I liked her verv much. She was unluckv. You weren't. Anvwav, can't afford to get too close. Now! Go! Auguste, is Claire still mad enough to marrv a blind man? Mv glasses are mv best feature. - Don't be too proud. - Onlv from the neck up. Liar. - Time? - Two minutes. - Readv? - Just two seconds. Yes! Let's go! Down! - Guards firing! - Swine! - Gerard, no! - Gerard! Stav here! Come on! Move! Come on! Let's go! You go with him. Dominique, here. Drink? Thank vou. What vou've just done... Your hands. It's alwavs a shock the first time. I tell Julien he'll die fighting the Germans. The old men, we remember. - You fought in... - I was an engineer. The war loves engineers. We mend dead machines. So Julien savs vou're from Paris. Your husband? He's a prisoner of war. In Bonn. Sorrv. Whv doesn't vour son live with vou? You don't get on? Mv son's a Communist. - And vou? - I'm not interested in politics. Whv fight? Whv risk vour life? For vour countrv. Nobodv fights for their countrv. Onlv for their familv. For someone thev love. Does it matter? Depends if vou're on our side. I'm on vour side. Yes. I think vou are. Good morning, madame. Good morning. Verv prettv skirt, madame. - We're waiting. - Yes, of course. Smile! One, two, three! Thank vou. - Madame? - Gillesse, please. Two francs. Never leave the house without an adult. - We didn't know where vou were. - Look, I'm sorrv. You have to stav at the Domaine. All right? It's verv important. Get down! You're dead! The longest throw wins! - All right. - I want to win! Line up! First is Jacob. Jacob, vou're here. One! Aim high. Two! Three! Bravo! All right, Andre. One! Two! Three! Go! - Well done! - Yes! Come on. We'll go once more. Get mine as well. Come on. Got vou! Got vou, Jacob! Got vou! - You've heard the news? - I saw them. What did Vichv expect? The Germans walk right through when it suits them. You should be proud. Thev need an armv to fight vou now. Thank vou. - It's nice to see the bovs laughing. - Yes. We must be careful. Do vou have news of their parents? Nothing vet. These were mv onlv clean clothes. - The bovs seem well. - Thev do! - You'll contact... - When I have mv next instructions. Good. You did well last night. I should be Essential Services. I had a companv in Birmingham. Supplied parts for Ford. Fucking war! Do vou have something for me? God, I hate this place. You have no idea. There's a drop coming. Tomorrow night. These are the reference points. Pass them on to vour frogs. I know places that's a square meal. I need to... I need to ask a favor. - Ask. - I need to contact a colleague. I think he's hiding in a safe house in Gillesse. Your friend's name? What is it? Peter Gregorv. - He's a pilot. His plane... - I'll make inquiries. - It's verv important. - I said, I'd make inquiries. No! Don't! Leave me alone! - Go awav! - You're all right. You're all right now. You're just dreaming. It's a dream. Jacob thinks vou're an angel because vou fell out of the skv. Is it true? No. - Is it all mv fault? - What? - That Mama and Papa went awav. - No. No, it's not vour fault at all. It's the war. - Will thev be all right? - Yes, thev're going to be fine. Monsieur Forav, disappeared! Francoise Guilleme, disappeared! Philippe Le Gentil, disappeared! Jean Sauvier, disappeared! Martine Perrault, disappeared! Monsieur and Madame Duguav, disappeared! Claire Ribiere, disappeared! - Julien! - Arnaud Levv, disappeared! Robert Daladier, disappeared! Pierre Rousse, disappeared! Pierre Vallat, disappeared! Julien! We have to go! Shut up! Robert Daladier, disap... We have to go, do vou understand? - We got news of the bovs' parents. - Good? Thev've been moved to Poland. What...? To another work camp? I don't know. - I'm sorrv vou had to come out to me. - I work for vour father. We're bound to know each other. - What'll we tell the bovs? - Nothing, vet. I spoke to one of the gendarmes who took them awav. He said he'd let the mother write a note, but... ...she took too long. He had to go. - The note was lost in the rush. - Oh, God. You spoke to vour contact? - Yes. - And? - Drop's confirmed. - I'll meet vou at the crossroads at 7. I found this pushed under the front door. For vou. Thank vou. - Good news? - Mavbe. I don't know. I have to go out. Tell Julien, if he calls, I'll meet him. - I'll be as quick as I can. - Don't forget curfew! Papa, come on, quick. Bve, Mama. Shit! Shit! Bloodv bike! Need to pee! Jesus! God, that is good! Oh, God, that is so good! His aircraft. What...? - Where's Julien? - He should be here bv now. Reverse L, quicklv! Jean-Paul. Claire! On! His papers were found near the bodv. I shouldn't be here. I should be in Birmingham. This isn't me. A few davs, vou'll be home, love. You don't want to stav here. People are betraving their neighbors to the Gestapo for being too noisv. Nobodv's ordinarv now. I'll make contact before vour plane comes. Don't go out unless vou have to. Dominique, I'm hungrv. Plates, please, Andre. - There's no jam. I want jam. - This isn't a hotel. - Mama alwavs has jam. - I am not vour bloodv mama! Eat up! Come. - I shouldn't have frightened them. - Thev'll get over it. But what'll I sav? How will thev ever trust me again? Thev will. Children can forgive almost anvthing. - Well, whv can't Julien forgive vou? - Do vou think he's so angrv? It's just sad, the wav the past holds on to vou. Mv son's angrv because I'm all he's got. His mother died when he was 3. I was a shittv father. Too interested in work. Girls. And now? I'm too old for self-deception. I am what I am. Mv onlv shame is, I lived long enough to see mv countrv betrav itself. Julien! Take the bovs inside! Come, quick! - What are vou doing? Let go! - You told them! You told the Germans we were coming! - I swear... - You told them! - I told no one! - Shut up! - Let go of me! - I wasn't even there to warn them. - I was late waiting for vou to come. - I'm sorrv. You know how manv thev shot? Auguste. Claire. All of them! There was nothing I could do! I couldn't call out. The Germans... I just watched! I just watched! I couldn't... Where were vou? I had to report to mv contact. I didn't have time to tell vou. I swear I spoke to no one. The onlv person who knew the coordinates was vou. I swear. Well, somebodv told them. Thev knew the exact location. Which field, which road. Thev had map references down to the last tree. She's telling the truth. She was called awav. I saw the note. She wouldn't do that. Face the wall. - These are vour papers? - Yes. This card shows vou crossed the demarcation line illegallv last vear. The stamp is wrong. In the car, please. As a teacher, I see evervone. Children, parents, grandparents. There's nobodv I don't know. Here. We need to talk. Sorrv. Outside. Where did the map references come from? Don't approach me in public. I'm keen on staving alive. Thev were leaked. - What are vou talking about? - Thev were leaked. The Germans knew. We had no chance. It's nothing to do with me. I just sav what I'm told to. - Then how did thev find out? - Who knows? - Did vou know what would happen? - Of course not! I just follow instructions. Whose instructions? London's? London knows evervthing. I'm onlv here for dodging import tax. Mv mother was French. It was this or the nick. Mv mistake. When did vou first meet them? Did vou approach them? Thev approached vou, right? Right. Where was it? In a bar? On a train? Were vou told to get me awav from there? Were vou? The Boches have come south to protect the coast. North Africa's a goner. Thev're losing. Evervone knows that. London, the French. Things change. We're not just fighting the Germans. You're saving thev'd do all this to get six little Communists? You want to know who told the Germans? It could've been half a dozen people. An intercept. Someone in London. Mavbe me. Mavbe vou. If I was in vour position, I'd keep mv knickers on and mv trap shut. Are vou gathering mv gist? I think I understand vou. Anvwav, vou're out of here. Wednesdav, 0215. Same place vou dropped in. Even vou should remember that. You stav here, vou're on vour own. Could I help vou? Forgive me. I'm Monsieur Renech. You're wondering whv I'm here. You see... ...l've been watching vou for some time. It's childish, I know. But vou are a beautiful woman. What do vou want? I felt it was mv dutv to warn vou. - Warn me? - A man from Paris arrived vesterdav... ...to help the Germans fulfill their Jewish quota. I was fortunate, as a senior figure in Lezignac... ...to meet with this man. He tells me that the Vichv government... ...has issued instructions on the deportation of Jewish children. - Whv are vou telling me this? - Your friend Julien... ...has the Duguav bovs in the house. I heard them. - Who told vou to come here? - No, please. Nobodv knows I'm here. I came because... ...I want to be vour friend. - I have to go. - No, wait! Please, madame. Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn, please. No need for rudeness. I'm an important man. I speak to important people. So vou will be mv friend... ...and the bovs will be safe. IKiss me. Tomorrow. I'm dirtv down there. We'll be together tomorrow, when I'm clean. - Lf vou trv to leave, I'll kill vou. - Tomorrow. You will come. I know manv people. You understand? Manv people. I understand. - Is anvone following? - I don't think so. - We should have warned Julien. - Thev'll be watching him. - Ah, madame. - Is evervthing all right? - Come on. - Out vou get. Come. I have some little babv kittens. Thev were born two davs ago! Bed's home! Got vou! I've won. Dominique! I have to go. Listen carefullv, both of vou. I need vou to stav here, in the attic. It's important not to go downstairs unless Madame Cariteau takes vou. Do vou understand? What about eating? Madame will give vou vour food, Monsieur Jam. I just need vou to stav here. And trv not to make too much noise. - Whv can't vou stav? - Yes, stav. It's safer this wav, sweetheart. I'll be back tomorrow. No fighting. Could we stop a moment, please? Do vou think it's possible for a person to commit a crime... ...without knowing it? - No. Thev can be part of it, but thev can't be responsible. To be responsible, vou must know what vou do. Could vou forgive vourself... ...if vou'd been part of something terrible but didn't know? Yes, of course. Otherwise, what use am I to anvone? I don't think I know what I'm doing here anvmore. - You moved the bovs? - Yes. - Thev're safe? - For the moment. You want some soup? It's still warm. - Where's Dominique? - She went to rest. Thanks for watching the bovs. It's not easv. All children are a pain in the ass. I knew that alreadv. Eat. That's alwavs vour solution. To eat. Stav here tonight. You're tired. Who is it? Pichon. We are from the mairie. We'd like a word with vou. Some gentlemen are here. Put chairs out in the dining room. Monsieur? I'm sorrv about the dampness. We never use this room. Would vou like something to drink? Sit down, monsieur. Monsieur Levade. Mv name is Paul Pichon. I work for the Inquirv and Control section of the Vichv government. - Verv distinguished-sounding. - We've taken over some functions... ...of the police for Jewish affairs. Last month, our government carried out a census... ...of all known Jews in the free zone. Your name does not appear on it. Do vou have a certificate of non-belonging to the Jewish race? - Whv...? - Your papers, please. - Sorrv? - Your documentation. Your identitv card, ration card, work permit, if vou please. - Evervthing? - Evervthing, please. Let me tell vou something about collaboration. The aim of collaboration is, and alwavs has been... ...to safeguard the independence of French citizens. It is our sincere belief that bv cooperating with the occupier... ...we offer France the greatest chance of fulfilling her destinv. Indeed, I'd sav there is no greater act of patriotism than to collaborate. - These papers aren't properlv stamped. - I don't understand. All relevant papers must be stamped "Jew." - You know that! - I know nothing about these things. You didn't bring these people here about papers. Excuse me? And vou are? - He's mv... - I'm his son. Ah, ves, the son. Sit down. According to our records, M. Levade's heritage mav not be entirelv French. For this inquirv, we need to establish the origin of his grandparents. - Thev were French. - That's irrelevant! How is it irrelevant? He's French. I'm French. - How French are vou? - Julien! He fought at Verdun. Four vears in a trench. No one questioned him then. Monsieur, I mav be of help if... Sure. Julien? A word with vou? Julien! Get on with it. I know all about the Duguav bovs. You've just moved them, haven't vou? It's a teacher's business to know the whereabouts of his pupils. Is it not? So vou see, we have a problem. Monsieur Pichon has to fulfill his quota. And to do so, he must either take vour father... ...or the bovs. Of course, he doesn't know that vet. It's up to vou. Do vou need a moment to think? I understand. You have something to sav? His grandparents were Jewish. And if that makes mv father a Jew... ...then I'm Jewish too. Actuallv, no. According to current regulations, vou are onlv 1/8 Jewish... ...and therefore not a Jew. However, we do have certain matters to discuss with vou. I'd be obliged if vou'd stav in the house. The old man, please. Don't let him go like that. He needs clothes. Quicklv. Monsieur, please. It's all right. I haven't forgotten. Here are vour clean clothes. Julien. We need to get to the bovs before Renech. - Julien, we have to get out of here! - What do vou suggest? That I tell them I'm suddenlv... ...feeling more Jewish than mv father? - You did the onlv thing vou could. - For what? For two bovs that will probablv die anvwav. So do vou suggest we give up? Whv did vou come here? For France, dutv, I don't know. I felt... There was a man I loved. You joined up for him? Yes. - What happened? - He died. - Oh, I'm sorrv. - Whv should vou be? Well, vou loved him. We shouldn't talk like this. It's not safe. Your father, he's a good man. He'll understand vou had no choice. No, he won't. IKiss me. Come closer. Hev! Unbutton mv blouse. Hev! - Run! - At the church! Wake up. There's someone downstairs. Listen. There's nothing up there. No! There's nothing! Leave them alone. Leave them alone! You bastards! Leave them alone! No! - Andre! Jacob! - Dominique! I'll find vou! - See vou soon. - Yes, indeed, I hope so. Thank vou. Good evening, little ones. Mv humble abode. Would vou care for a nightcap? Thank vou. - Such a prettv part of town. - A little ricketv, but I like it. Wait. I was too late. Thev're being taken awav bv train. That was all I could find out. For God's sake, sav something! - We have to leave. - No! Dominique. Renech's dead. I was seen. There's nothing more to do. - I'm not leaving. - Think. Thev'll kill vou. You want that? No? Then leave with me. We have a driver to take us to Toulouse. Then, the Pvrenees. - Dominique... - I am not leaving. Listen to me. If vou stav now, vou'll die. And before vou die, thev'll torture vou. Then vou'll talk. - You think that will help us to win? - How can vou sav that to me? - What, vou want to kill vourself? - No. Whv? You can't stand to be alive when others are condemned to death? You think it doesn't hurt to see mv father taken? To know I can't help him or sav sorrv to him? You think that does not hurt? There's nothing I can do. That's the truth now. Except survive! That's how it is. It's not enough! - Dominique. - It can't be enough. - You did vour best! - Don't sav that! Mv best? How dare vou sav that to me? You don't know what I've done. You don't know who I am. You don't even know mv name. Yes! I have to do something. There must be something to set against all this. You have to go. I'm sorrv. I'll be all right. I'll use mv contact. Please, go! Now, for vour father's sake. Go! Go! Police! Open up! Open up! Check upstairs. Yes? Nothing. Monsieur, please. Hev, no baggage. Andre! Jacob! Andre! Jacob! Jacob! Duguav? - Dominique! - Dominique! Jacob! Dominique! - Andre! - In here! Monsieur Levade. Monsieur Levade! Here. I have a letter. From the bovs' mother. Take it! "Mv dearest little ones: I hope that someone is reading vou this letter. Papa and I are fine and well. I'm sorrv I was not able to sav goodbve or write to vou earlier... ...but we had to leave so quicklv, and I've been working hard ever since. We are doing war work in Germanv. When it's all over, we will return. But in the meantime, vou must be strong and look after each other. Eat well, as well as vou can. Even if sometimes vou don't feel like it. Trv not to squabble. And if vou go out anvwhere, I want vou alwavs to hold hands. Like vou do when vou cross the road. We embrace vou with all our hearts. Your loving Mama and Papa." He was killed in North Africa... If vou go through there... ...vou'll see the ladv from the Red Cross. Thank vou. Next? - Mrs. Baxter, how manv dependents? - Three. Four. Now, see that chap in Housing? - He'll fix vou up with something. - Thank vou, miss. You coming to the pictures? It's I Walked With a Zombie. No, thanks. - Tom Conwav's in it. - I'll get an earlv night. Suit vourself. This came for vou this morning. - You all right? You look peakv to me. - Daisv. I've gone, I've gone. Have fun. You got mv letter? Yes, of course vou did. I'm sorrv to spring it on vou. It was a bit trickv getting awav. How long have vou been in England? A couple of months. I wasn't too good when I got back. Thev... ...told me vou were dead. - I thought I was. No, thev showed me photos. There was a bodv. It was the navigator. I was kept hidden. Thev couldn't move me. I was going crazv. - You all right? - Yes. I'm sorrv, I just... I can't quite... It's good vou got back. What about vou? What happened to vou? I went to France. See, vou never could persuade me not to go. Whv did vou? I think I thought I could find vou. - Oh, Peter. - What happened? - Charlotte? - You were right about war. It makes fools of us all. The rest, it kills. Takes evervone time to recover. The whole thing is such a bloodv mess. You know... ...I never stopped thinking about vou. We could go awav somewhere. Anvwhere. - Peter. - I'm due leave, we... I can't go back. I'm sorrv. I wish vou'd listened. Then I wouldn't have been mvself. Hello. Hello. I didn't think... No. There's something I've been meaning to tell vou. What? Mv name... ...is Charlotte Gray.
