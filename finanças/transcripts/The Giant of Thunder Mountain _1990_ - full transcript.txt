(soft trumpeting music) (birds calling) (wistful folksy music) (folksy music swells) (moves to soaring uplifting music) (uplifting music softens) - [Narrator] It was the autumn of 1896. Grover Cleveland was President, and the fever the Gold Rush started was still in the air. But on this October day, the air crackled with the promise of something new, something that would change us all forever. - Well, if that don't bring 'em in like ants to a picnic, ain't a cow in Texas. - So you think it'll be okay, huh, Pa? - If I tell you chicken can pull a plow, don't argue, hitch him up. Give me a rag. (Hezekiah muttering) (rooster crowing) (wood knocking) (chicken clucking) - Now, we have rules here. One of the rules is if you want to be a member of the club, you have to do something that we tell you to do. What we've decided you have to do is climb Thunder Mountain. (quick ominous music) - But there's a giant up there! - Yeah, and they say he rips kids in half and eats 'em for breakfast. - You're not afraid. Are you? - I ain't afraid of anything. Neither is Ben. - Look, I'm not scared. - Well, what do you say? You gonna do it, or do you wanna be known all around town as chickens? (boys squawking) - Sure we'll do it! We ain't scared. - I'm kind of partial to this fabric. (trap clanks) - This is the latest thing. I just got five of 'em in this week. This is especially for bear. It'll take a grizzly's leg clean off. - Then I'll take all five. - Oh. (laughing) Come right on over here. - Hi Mom. Hi Mrs. Macgruder. - Well, what are you two boys doing here? - We were looking for you. We wanted to tell you that we're going hiking, and we'll be back later. - You boys going up on Thunder Mountain, you best stick to the beaten path and look out for that bear. You know what happened up there. - And don't forget that crazy giant. He's up there, too. They say he went crazy and killed his folks. - Mom, we'll be real careful. And we'll be back by dark. - I'm counting on you boys to stay out of trouble. (feet pattering) (wistful folksy music) - [Narrator] I was eight years old and surrounded by a gaggle of boys trying to prove their manly natures, including my brothers Tommy and Ben. They were up to something, but that was nothing new. After Pa died, I know Tommy felt like he had to be the man of the house, and he took it upon himself to provide a kind of example for Ben, my younger brother, of how a man should act. They spent most of the time fighting imaginary dragons and scaring themselves silly. This time, though, it looked like the dragon was real. So that day, they went up Thunder Mountain, searching for a giant, and praying they wouldn't find one. (lightning crashes) (thunder rumbling) - Look at the size of those logs. - Anybody who could build a house out of logs that big could crush us like a bug. I'm getting out of here. - Oh, no, wait! - I don't wanna wait. Let's go! - We've come this far. Let's look inside the cabin. - I don't want to look inside the cabin. What if he's in there? - We'll be real quiet. Come on. (low ominous music) (lightning crashing) - Tommy, wait! (storm rumbling) - [Tommy] Oh, no. - Please, Tommy, let's go! These are the graves of the people he killed. We could be next. (low foreboding music) - Come on, hurry! (foreboding music peaks) (footsteps padding) Okay. I'll give you a boost, and you look inside the window. - I don't want to look inside the window. I just want to go. - We just gotta look inside. Aren't you curious? - No! - Oh, come on, just a quick look, and then we'll go. (thunder crashes) - I know we're going to get killed. I just know it. - Sure, Ben, sure. Well, what'd you see? - Nothing. The window's too high. I'm leaving. - Fine, leave. We've come this far, I'm gonna look inside. - But you promised we'd go! (deep ominous music) (thunder crashing) (rain pattering) (lightning crashes) Tommy! Wait! You aren't going in there, are you? (wood clunks) (hinges creaking) I don't like this. - You don't like anything. Be quiet. (hinges creaking) (door thuds) (high suspenseful music) - Look at this. (blade zings) - [Tommy] He must have carved these. (ominous music intensifies) (ominous music deepens) - Tommy! We're dead! - It's only deer meat, dummy. Don't be so jumpy. (storm rumbling distantly) (intense foreboding music) - The giant! Tommy, the giant! The giant! He's coming! Tommy, look! Look! He's coming! The giant, the giant! (foreboding music quickens) (Tommy gasps) - Come on, quick! - What are we doing? I'm gonna hide in the- - No, no, you're not. (foreboding music intensifies) Under the table! (boys muttering) The carving. (latch clunks) (door creaking) - It's him. (door thuds) (giant breathing heavily) (steps thumping) (ax thuds) (boys gulping) (low foreboding music) (foreboding music builds) (boys whimpering) (foreboding music intensifies) (boys screaming) (door creaking) (moves to dramatic theatrical music) (Ben yelling) (storm rumbling) - We made it. We Made it. (slow dramatic music) Ben, wait up! - [Ben] I'm not waiting for nothing! (door clunks) (footsteps pattering) - Where in the world have you boys been? - We met this new friend. He does wood carvings. Well, we better go clean up. (boys gurgling nervously) - [Narrator] New friend that does wood carvings? (soft nostalgic music) Ma believed that, but I sure didn't, and I wasn't about to set still till I found out what they's up to. Seems that Ben and Tommy and the other boys in town had formed a special club. "Boys only." Zeke Macgruder had fashioned himself ringleader of the bunch, I'm sure since he was the biggest. His mouth was, anyways. If I wanted to find out what my brothers was up to, it'd be at their secret meeting place under Zeke's house. Huh, some secret. - [Zeke] Where'd you get this? - We borrowed it from the giant. (rooster crowing) - That's pretty good. I don't believe it. Let's just go up and see this giant friend of yours. Up! (deep foreboding music) - [Narrator] I'm sure if Zeke Macgruder had a former life, he was a cow. He act like he had two stomachs. In fact, talking and eating at the same time was one of his specialties. That along with bossing people around. I hear he ended up a Congressman. - Well, Ben, you think the giant's gonna be home? - [Ben] I don't know, but I hope he is so Zeke can meet him. - [Zeke] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Narrator] I had no intention of being left behind. I, too, was longing for some adventure. Besides, if my brothers had made friends with a giant, he was going to be my friend, too. - [Zeke] I'm getting hungry. Aren't you guys getting hungry? I hope this won't take too long. I'm getting tired. (low tense music) I could sure go for a piece of pie. (tense music builds) (tense music drops) Aren't you guys getting hungry? (metal clangs) (Amy screams) - It's Amy! Amy, are you nuts? That could have chopped your leg off. - My stick accidentally set off one of Carl's traps. It scared me for a minute. - Scared you? Those traps are dangerous! You could have been hurt! What are you doing here? - I wanna see the giant, too. - [Boys] No. - I can come if I want to. - Amy, go home. - I sure hope nobody tells Ma about this. - Women. (Tommy sighs) - Well, we're almost there. Stay behind us and be quiet. - Okay. - [Zeke] I'm getting hungry. (deep ominous music) The giant better be up here after walking this far. - [Tommy] He's up here. - [Ben] And he's big. - [Narrator] By this time, I knew Tommy and Ben hadn't really made friends with the giant. And Zeke, for all his bluster, had a yellow streak right down the middle of his back. We were about to separate the men from the boys, or the boys from the girls. - [Ben] There he is. (footsteps rustling) (dramatic plodding music) (giant grunts) (log booms) - Good grief! Okay, I've seen him. Uh, I just remembered, my mom promised to make rhubarb pie. I love rhubarb pie. Bye. Whoa. (leaves rustling) - What are you gonna do with the carving? - I, uh- - I know! Let's leave it right here. - Yeah, right, we'll leave it right here. He'll find it. - [Amy] Chickens. Boys! - No! Amy, come back. - Hi! (branch clatters) I'm Amy. Tommy and Ben told me all about you. Come on! He's not gonna hurt ya. My brothers are awful sorry about yesterday. They were just curious and got scared. We want to give this back to you. (hatchet thumps) This is Tommy, and this is Ben. - [Tommy And Ben] Hi. - Can I have some water? I'm awful thirsty. Aren't you thirsty? - Come on, Amy. We don't wanna bother Mr... - Eli. - This is yours, too. - Come on. - Where's she going? - I don't know. We better get home before he gets hungry. (door thumps) (hinges creak) - Boy, you sure are lucky to have such big furniture. (water splashing) You made all this, didn't you? - Yeah. He made these, too. - Let me see. Is that the bear that's supposed to be around here? - He is around here. He killed my Ma and Pa. - It must be real lonely. - [Eli] You better go. - Amy, we gotta go. (door creaking) (gentle nostalgic music) - Where's he going? - Wherever he wants. (box thuds) (soil scraping) - Let me help. You sure have big hands. - I forgot the water. - [Tommy And Ben] I'll get it. - Why are you planting these? - Pa taught me to always put back part of what I took. - Tommy, there's the bucket. (nuggets clattering) Look! I wonder if these are real. Do you know how to tell the difference between real gold and fool's gold? - [Tommy] Let's take some back to town. Jesse'll know. - I don't know. - It's not like we're stealing, Ben. We'll bring it back tomorrow. We better get back with the water. - I'm sorry your folks died. My Pa died, too. - The big book says they're in a better place. - I don't remember my Pa. Ma says he was real nice. Can I water them? Please. (ladle clacking) (water sloshes) What a cute, little dog. - That's not a dog. That's a wolf. - Wow. A real wolf for a pet. (owl hooting) - It's getting late. We better go. - You're right. Ma'll be worried. - Do we have to? - Yes, Amy, we do. - Eli, can I come back up here to see you again? - Your Ma might not like it. - My Ma won't mind. She's real nice. Pretty, too. Why don't you come down and meet her? Come to dinner tomorrow night. - Hm. - Come on, Amy! - See you tomorrow night, Eli! (nuggets rattling) Hi! What are you... Is that real gold? - Nah, it's probably just fool's gold. - Where'd you get it? - Up around the giant's cabin. - Well, what are you looking at me for? It's the truth. - Well, if it's fool's gold, you won't mind me taking a small little... - Better let her have it, or she'll tell Ma. (Tommy sighs) (soft wistful music) - [Narrator] I couldn't believe they'd think I'd actually tell Ma about all this. (chuckling) I had a little gold nugget, and I was off to the general store to see what it might buy. (Amy clears throat) - Well, hello there, Amy. What can I do for you this fine day? - I think I'd like some candy. - All right. (bag crinkling) - I'll take one of those. (candy rattles) And maybe some of those. - Some of these? - And some rock candy, too. - Rock candy, all right. (candy clatters) Where are you gonna get the money to pay for all this? - Right here. That's real gold, of course. - [Customer] Pardon me, Jesse, can you help me with this bag of flour? - I'll be right back. - Excuse me, dear. Am I to understand that you don't know, or you're not sure, if that's real gold or not? - Yep. My brothers found it up on Thunder Mountain. They're not sure if it's real, either. (Hezekiah chuckling) - But very fortunate for you, you know, I happen to be an expert in these matters. Can I see it? Exactly where did your brothers find this? - I'm not sure. Probably around the giant's house. - Giant? What giant? - You know, the giant that lives up on Thunder Mountain. - Oh, that giant, yes. (chuckles) Well, as Shakespeare used to say- - Who? - A noted foreign writer. He said that all that glitters ain't necessarily worth nothing. - What is that supposed to mean? - Iron pyrite, fool's gold, no value. (laughs) However, since Hezekiah Crow is such a softy, I'm willing to buy that candy and trade it to you for this worthless rock. (wagons rattling faintly) - I don't think so. - Hm. And I will throw in a free ticket to Saturday's carnival, deal? - No deal. I want three. - All right. Three. - And one for a friend. - And one for a friend. Now, do we have a deal? - We got a deal. (Eli grunts) (wood cracks) - [Narrator] They say that money is the root of all evil, but I'd say that the desire for other people's money, or gold, is more like it. I wanted those tickets, and Hezekiah had the fever. Gold fever. Fair trade, don't you think? As I crossed the meadow, my heart raced inside of me. (gasps) I had a ticket for someone special. (gentle music) - Hi! (ax clunks) Have you ever been to a carnival? (ax clatters) - A what? - Carnival. You know, where they have fireworks and everything. - No. I've never been to a carnival. - Why don't you come to the celebration on Saturday? There's gonna be a real parade. And a band, and live circus animals. Lions, monkeys, and even an elephant. - The townspeople are afraid of me. - Maybe you're afraid of the townspeople. - Amy, the last time I came into town, I was 12 years old. I made up my mind right there and then, I was never coming down that mountain again. - But you have to have fun sometime. You're all grown up now. Nobody would dare laugh at you now. Besides, you'll be with me and Ben and Tommy. Gonna have ice-cold watermelon. And taffy candy and everything. Come on, say you'll go. I even got a ticket for you. - Well, maybe. - Oh good! I knew you'd come. Oh, and don't forget about dinner tonight. My mom's expecting you. It's the house at the edge of town, can't miss it. See you tonight! (gentle music brightens) (Eli puffs) (crickets chirping) (owl hooting) (dishes clinking) - What time is your new friend supposed to get here? (door knocking) - He's here! He's here! (crickets chirping) (frogs croaking) Eli, this is my Ma. I told you she was real pretty. - Thank you. - [Ben] Boy, I'm starved. Can we eat now? - Oh yeah, sure. Everything's ready. Come on over and have a seat. Eli, you sit here. (chair creaks) - Ma, you should see his furniture. It's big, really big. - Yeah! His whole house is big. - Sure looks good, ma'am. (dishes clinking) (Alicia clears throat) (owl hooting) (dishes clinking) - Uh, Eli, tell Ma about the bear. - The bear killed my folks, ma'am. - Eli does carvings, Ma, and he has a wolf for a pet. - A wolf? - It's just a baby, Ma. (deep ominous music) (creature growling lowly) - This the best apple pie I've had in years. - Thank you. - I knew you'd like my Ma. - That's a beautiful clock. - It's been in my family for generations. - [Eli] It doesn't work? - No, nobody ever knew what was wrong with it. - Let me take a look at it. (ominous music) - [Alicia] Well, it's getting late, and the kids have to go to bed. And I have to- - Oh, Mom, just a few more minutes. (Tommy sighs) Come on, Ben. Come on, Amy. Good night, Eli. (crickets chirping) (low foreboding music) (foreboding music quickens) (clock cuckoos) (low ominous music) (creature grumbling lowly) (blade scrapes) (bear breathing heavily) (moves to deep foreboding music) (foreboding music increases) (foreboding music crescendos) (foreboding music fades) - Chick, chick chick chick, chick. Chick chick chick chick chick, chick chick, chick, (rooster crowing) chick chick, chick chick. (chickens clucking) The giant's coming! The giant's coming! - You came! I knew you would. I just knew it. - I came to see the elephant. (bouncy folk music) Let's go. (crowd cheering) (folk music softens) (woman gasps) - [Townswoman 1] Come on, Cindy. I knew I shouldn't have come to town today. - I could sure go for a piece of pie. - I just wonder if Alicia Wilson knows about this. I feel it's to my civic duty to tell her. (townspeople muttering) - [Zeke] I'm getting hungry. (lively folk music rises) (spectators cheering) - Yeah! - [Amy] Look, Eli! (moves to deep tense music) (bear roaring) (Pa Weaver yelling) - Help me! (screaming) Ma, get the gun! (tense music grows) (shells clattering) (Pa Weaver yelling) (bear growling) (gunshot blasts) (shot blasts) (Ma Weaver screaming) (Eli gasping) - Eli! (lively folk music returns) What were you looking at? The parade's almost over. - [Child] Daddy, what's the shovel for? (elephant trumpeting) - [Father] What's the shovel for? (crowd yelling) - Let's go to the midway. (crowd laughing) (elephant trumpeting) - [Carnival Barker] Step right up, ladies and gentlemen! See the show. Your eyes will be amazed as you visit the bearded lady! Elastic man with a reach of 72 inches! (elephant snuffling) (playful accordion music) (elephant trumpets) (carnival workers barking) - Step right up, folks. Knock over the bottles, win a valuable prize. Only one thin dime, 1/10 of a dollar. Say there, how'd you like to win this beautiful doll for your little girl? It's easy. Nothing to it. All you have to do is knock down the bottles. Easy as rolling off a log. Come on. Only a dime to make that little girl happy. Step right up, folks - Oh, Eli, it's beautiful. - Come on. I know you'd like to win this beautiful doll for this beautiful little girl of yours, so I tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll show you just how easy it is. (bottles clanging) All you have to do is knock down the bottles. Easy as rolling off a log. Well, what do you say? (crowd bustling) (metal clinking) (bottles clinking) (bottles clinking) (Eli grunts) (bottles shatter) - Listen, folks, we have a winner. This rather large gentleman has just won this beautiful doll for this little girl. Step right up, folks. Knock over the bottles and win a valuable prize. Only one thin dime, 1/10 of a dollar. It's easy, nothing to it. All you have to do is knock down the bottles. Easy as rolling off a log. Step right up, folks. Knock over the bottles and win a valuable prize. Step right up, folks, win a doll. Three tries for a dime, 1/10 of a dollar. (Eli grunts) (lively music drops) - Give her the doll. - But I did! Like I told you. - The big one. - That's all right, Eli. The little one is nice. - Put me down, you big oaf! You can't scare me into giving you a prize you didn't win. I don't care how big you are! (Percey yelps) (ground thuds) (crowd muttering) - Amy, where did you get that doll? - From Mr. Eli. He won it for me. - How? By bullying a poor carnival worker? Ma! Please, Ma, listen. - Hey, why don't you pick on somebody your own size? - [Townsman 2] Yeah, why don't you go back where you came from? - [Townswoman 2] You're a troublemaker! - [Townsman 3] We don't like bullies! (low tense music) - [Townsman 4] You have no business in our town! - [Townsman 5] You're as dumb as you are ugly. - [Townswoman 2] We don't want you around our kids! - [Townsman 6] Who do you think you are, anyway? - Go back where you came from, you big freak! - [Townsman 7] We don't do things like that down here! (crowd jeering) - [Townsman 8] Get on out of here, boy! - Come on, you ain't so big. I ain't afraid of you! Look, folks, the giant ain't nothing but a big chicken! (crowd laughing) (imitating chicken) (tense music swells) (porcelain shatters) (tense music drops) (doll thumps) (woman gasps) (crowd muttering) - Look what they're doing to him! Eli, wait! - You talked me into coming down. I should have known better. It ain't no different from before. I don't need them, and I don't need you. (low forlorn music) I don't need anybody! And stay off of my mountain! (light ragtime music) - [Saloon Patron 1] No way, she picked me first. - [Saloon Patron 2] No, she loves me! All right? That's enough talking now, you're gonna get it! - [Saloon Patron 1] What are you trying to prove? - [Saloon Patron 2] I'm trying to prove she's mine! - [Saloon Patron 1] Who do you think you are? - [Saloon Patron 2] I'm me! You know who I am, and she knows who I am. (blow thuds) (Patron 2 grunts) - [Saloon Patron 1] Well, she's mine now! (crowd laughing) (horse nickers) - [Saloon Patron 3] Let's get ourselves another bottle. (patrons chattering) (doors creak) - Pa, Pa, I gotta talk to you. - Not now, son, I'm busy securing my future. (chuckles) - I gotta be dumber than a stuffed duck to stay with his hand, but I'm gonna do it. - That's exactly why we invited you to play. I'm in, too. - I don't mean to interrupt, but do we get to see your cards now or in the spring? - Uh, can anyone beat a straight? - Flush. - I golly, my eyes must be playing tricks on me. I thought one of them was a diamond. It's a little straight all right, but they're all hearts. Makes a difference, doesn't it? (money rustling) - I bet your eyes aren't the only things playing tricks. - You cut me to the quick, sir. (deck thumps) Poker's much too dear to me to resort to petty deception. - Then you won't mind if we count the cards. - Be my guest. Well, gentlemen, I'm sorry to break up this little contest, but my son here wants to have a conference with me. Oliver. - He won't find an extra card, will he, Pa? - Well, if he does, somebody's cheating. This better be important, boy. - Remember that gold nugget you got from that little girl? - Yeah. - It belongs to that big fella up on Thunder Mountain. His Pa used to come into town a couple of times a year, paid for everything with gold nuggets. - Well, we better pay him a visit, see if he's got any more, huh? Meantime, I got some live ones over there at the table. (ladies tittering) I guess you boys can find something to amuse yourself with. - I guess. (crickets chirping) (low solemn music) - [Alicia] Amy, where did you get that doll? - [Amy] From Mr. Eli. He won it for me. - [Alicia] How? By bullying a poor carnival worker? - [Townsman 9] You big bully, you're a troublemaker! - [Townsman 1] Why don't you pick on somebody your own size? - [Townsman 10] Yeah, go back where you came from, you freak! - [Townsman 11] Look, folks, the giant ain't nothing but a big chicken! (townspeople cackling) (solemn music intensifies) - [Eli] I don't need you! And stay off of my mountain! - [Amy] Eli, wait! (solemn music fades) - But Ma, he's so nice. He didn't mean any harm. - Amy, I don't want to frighten you, but you must be more careful. Remember what I told you about strangers? Things aren't always what they appear to be. - I know. (chickens clucking) (goat bleating) (feet pattering) - Hi Zeke! (goat bleats) - Hi Mom. Are the cookies done yet? - Are the chores done yet? - Yep! - Then the cookies are in the jar. Help yourself. Your sister took some to the Macgruders. - The Macgruders? Why would? You go ahead and eat some, I'll be back in a little while. (chickens clucking) (Tommy panting) Have you seen Amy? (gentle nostalgic music) - What are you doing here? - Hi Eli. I, I brought you some cookies. (Eli sighs) (water dripping) (low gentle music) You don't look so good. Are you sick? - (grunts) A little. - Have some cookies. They're my favorite kind. They'll make you feel better. What's that? - Medicine. - Does it make you feel better? - No. But I'm doing better now. - The way you picked up that mean man, I was so proud. - (sighs) I shouldn't have done that. It was stupid. Say so right here. I guess I forgot that yesterday. My Pa said there's always somebody bigger. - Eli, you must be the biggest man in the whole world. Nobody could be bigger. - Amy, how'd you like to meet a real giant? - Taller than you? - Taller than me. Come on. - Hey Zeke! Have you seen Tommy? - He went thataway. (chickens clucking) - Thanks. Bye! (soft calm music) (door knocks) - Amy? Eli? (low plunky music) - Look, Pa! There's the cabin. - See if anyone's about. (Tommy spits) (gasping) Small wonder no one bothers him up here. All I can tell you is we better find that gold. Let's go. - There's a kid inside. - Perhaps a tap on the head. - He'll never know what hit him. (low plunky music) (Tommy gargling) (adds deep foreboding music) (blow thuds) (floor thumps) (Hezekiah chuckling) - Well, what a pleasure to observe the blissful slumber of children. (chuckles) Well, get to it, boys. Leave no stone unraveled. (chickens clucking) (door knocks) - Agnes, have you seen Amy? She came up here hours ago to bring Zeke some cookies. - No, I haven't seen her. Zeke, get in here! Have you seen Amy? (door thuds) Well, tell me the truth. Now. - Amy went up the mountain. (low tense music) - She did? - Yeah. Then Tommy followed her. And then Ben came up later. - I know this means trouble. Now, Zeke, you go tell Mr. Henderson to get all the men together that he can and meet me at the Wilson house. - Yes, ma'am. - There's something evil going on up there, I just know it. Well, don't just stand there, do it! - Yes, ma'am! - Now, you wait right here and don't turn around until I tell you. - Where are you going? - Not far. (birds trilling) (insects chirping) Don't look! Amy! Meet the General. (soft tender music) How big do I look now? - Tiny! - [Narrator] And, indeed, next to that magnificent tree, he did. (Amy laughs) - Do you remember what I told you about my Ma and Pa being in a better place? Look around. Isn't this a better place? Seems to me if God can make a place like this, that wherever our folks are must be even more beautiful. - Eli, you're the best friend I've ever had. (sudden intense music) (bear roaring) - Amy, run! - Eli! - Get outta here! - Eli! - [Eli] Go run to the cabin! (blow thuds) (Eli grunts) (bear roars) Go on! (blow thuds) (Eli grunts) (bear growls) (Eli yells) (bear bellowing) (Amy panting) (Eli groaning) (Amy panting) (bear roars) (Eli yells) (intense music quickens) (bear growling) (moves to deep dramatic music) (Amy grunts) (Eli grunts) (ground thuds) (bear roaring) (Eli grunts) (blow whacks) (bear thuds) (dramatic music softens) (bear grumbles) (strong grim music) (grim music softens) (branch thuds) (objects clattering) - [Percey] Pa! Look at this. (sudden menacing music) - Tommy! (moves to tense plunky music) You can't do this. Let me go! - Oliver, stick the little nipper in that gunnysack over there. And gag him! - [Ben] Let me go! (hinges creak) (door slams) (Ben fussing) (Ben mumbling urgently) - Figure he should bring a pretty fair price in San Francisco. Them sea captains are always looking for cabin boys. Now, let's proceed with the proceedings. What treasures have you unwittingly unveiled, boy? (sudden sinister music) (nuggets rattle) (Hezekiah grunts) (Ben moaning frantically) (sack rustling) Quiet, kid, or we'll drown ya. (Ben yelps) - There's the cabin! - There are times when I begin to think there's a ray of hope for you, boy. A small ray, for sure, but a ray nevertheless. (low tense music) - Pa, Percey, come here quick. (group chattering distantly) (men gasp) - They're heading toward the cabin, Pa. - I can see that! They don't know we're here. If we make haste, they won't even see us. (low sneaky music) (Ben grumbling faintly) (soft suspenseful music) (low furtive music) (window squeaking) - [Alicia] Oh, Tommy. (low grim music) - Looks of this place, boy must have fought like a wildcat. He'll be all right. Got a nasty bump, though. And he smells like gin. We'll get a couple of the boys together, take him back down to Doc Farnsworth. Henderson! Mobbs! - [Alicia] Ben. He's got Ben and Amy. - You gotta go back down with the boy. - Yeah? What's going on? - Spread out a blanket. We gotta take Alicia and the boy back down to Doc Farnsworth. - Amy. - All right, boys. Let's fan out and find him. Big as he is, ought to leave a path as wide as the Oregon Trail. Come on, let's get him! - Ma! (low frantic music) Ma! - There's a girl right there! - Amy! - [Amy] Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma. (frantic music relaxes) - Amy, are you hurt badly? Did he try to give you something to drink? - I'm sorry, Mom. I knew I shouldn't have done it, but he was so sad. - Amy, did anything happen to you? He took me to see the Old General, and on the way back, oh Ma, I was so scared. He was attacking us. He tried to kill us. - Ma'am, you best catch up with Henderson and Mobbs. We'll take care of this. Let's go, boys. (frantic music resumes) - What happened to Tommy? Where's Ben? - Don't you know? - No. (men yelling) Ma, where are those men going? - Let's go. They're gonna find Ben. - It's gonna be a turkey shoot. (frantic music softens) (men yelling) (steady sinister music) - Anything? - Nothing yet! - Over here, I think I heard him! (sinister music grows) - There he is! He's mine! (shot blasts) (bullet whizzes) - [Eli] Ow! - Who shot that? (Eli groaning) - I got him! (sinister music deepens) Down there, that clump of trees. He's gonna pay for what he did to that little gal. Go on, around the other way. (leaves rustling) (brief menacing music) (moves to low tense music) - He's been this way, over here! (Eli groans) (ground thuds) (leaves rustling) - Anything? - Got nothing over here, Ben! - [Vigilante 1] He's out there somewhere! (water gurgling softly) (wildlife chirping) (gun clacks) (foot thumps) (leaves rustle) (trap snaps) (Carl screams) (deep menacing music) (Carl exclaims) (menacing music building) (Carl grunting) - [Carl] Not my weapon! (menacing music crescendos) (menacing music slows) (menacing music quickens) (branches cracking) (moves to low tense music) (trap squeaking) (trap clangs) (tense music softens) (hunter yells) - [Carl] Over here! (water splashing) - You all right, Carl? - He could have killed me. - Doc! Doc! (horses clopping) - What do we have here? - We best be heading back up there, ma'am. - [Mobbs] We'll be needing us some torches. - We'll get every man we can in town. Let's go. - Good luck, boys. - But, Ma. (Alicia shushing) (door creaks) - We'll get him fixed up. (door thuds) (jaunty saloon music) (hooves clopping) (men chattering) - Hey hey. All right, everybody listen up! This is important. (jaunty music drops) - That crazy giant took Alicia Wilson's little girl up to the mountain. Her son followed him, and when they caught up, the giant got the kids all liquored up, and we're gonna need every able-bodied man we can get to find 'em. Who can I count on? (men clamoring) (chairs scraping) - Count me in, I'm goin'. - Let's go! - Come on! - Let's get him. (feet scuffing) - You coming, too? - Well, sir, I understand how you feel. I certainly do. It's a terrible thing. It's tragic. I remember one time, down around Saragosa Springs- - You coming or not? - Well, let's just say (horse whinnying) that I've always believed that neighbors should never turn on neighbor, and I've taught my boys to live like that. That right, boys? - Yep. - That's right, Pa. - You see, we're of a gentle persuasion that doesn't believe in violence. Anyway, our wagon threw a wheel, and we gotta get it fixed tomorrow so we can catch up with the carnival, you know, at the next town. You understand? (Henderson stomping) (hand smacks) - Now, girls, don't leave. - Us saloon girls have our standards, too, you know. - Oh, what'd you go and do that for, Pa? Now they's treating us like we's ugly. - Why, you intellectual pygmies, (hands slap) hasn't it ever dawned on you that every man in this town is gonna be running up that hill looking for that giant? Do you know what that means? - We can't get our wagon fixed till tomorrow? - It means that with the men gone, this town's gonna be easy pickins. Forget the wagon. Get the kid and get the horses. We'll pay a little visit to a couple of the upstanding households of this community, then we'll get out of town. Go! (boys chuckling) (horses whinnying) (hooves clopping) - All right! - All right, let's go, boys. (Tommy groans) - What did Eli do to you? - Not Eli, Ma. Not Eli. The carnival men. - Tommy, are you saying Eli didn't hurt you? - That's why I've been trying to tell you, Ma. Eli didn't hurt me. He saved me from the bear. He could be hurt! (low tense music) (posse whistling) (horses clomping) - Wait! Wait! Doc, can I borrow your horse? - It's out back, I'll saddle him up. - Can I come, Ma? Please? - No, there's been enough trouble for one day. Go to the Macgruders' till I get back. (moves to dramatic foreboding music) (hooves thudding rapidly) (moves to low melancholy music) - Oh, Eli, I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. (brief foreboding music) (hooves thudding quickly) - [Narrator] So, while everyone else went to catch Eli on Thunder Mountain, I, who had caused the whole mess, went someplace far less interesting. Or so I thought. (objects clattering) (low tense music) (man yells) (objects smashing) (Hezekiah laughing) - Where's your husband, huh? - He won't be back until tomorrow. He's in Sacramento. (Hezekiah laughing) - [Narrator] Zeke, as usual, was flapping his gums and making matters worse for everyone. I could see it 'as up to me to save the Macgruders. So I run as fast as my legs would carry me to get help. (urgent dramatic music) (horses whinnying) (hooves thundering) (feet clomping) (door creaks) - The carnival men have Mrs. Macgruder and Zeke. And Ben, too. Oh Doc, we have to do something to stop them. - Now, Amy, calm down and take it easy. We'll stop them. - [Amy] They've all got guns. (quick somber music) (door slams) Tommy, I've got find Eli. (intense foreboding music) (hooves thundering) (posse whooping) (gunshots booming) (torch clatters) (window shatters) (torch thuds) (fire crackling) (shots blasting) (hooves thundering) (window shatters) (fire roaring) (intense music swells) (moves to low melancholy music) (gunfire blasting) (posse hollering) (tense dramatic music) (moves to tense sorrowful music) (horses whinnying) (fire roaring) (sorrowful music grows) (cabin crashing) (sorrowful music dwindles) (hooves clomping rapidly) (fire roaring) (horse whinnies) - Is he inside? - I'm afraid not, ma'am, but we'll get him. - Listen to me! It wasn't him. He didn't hurt Amy or Tommy. You're after the wrong man! It was the carnival man! (deep ominous music) (crickets chirping) (Amy gasps) (Eli shushes) (ominous music fades) - [Amy] You're bleeding. What happened? - We'll talk about that later. What are you doing up here? - I was trying to find you. The carnival men have captured Zeke, Mrs. Macgruder, and Ben, and they're all tied up. And they hurt Tommy real, real bad. - Where are they? - Come on, I'll show you. (leaves rustling) (owl hooting) - Anything else worthwhile around here, boy, except $2 in this thing? (Zeke mumbling rapidly) - What'd he say? - He said there's a gold watch up on the shelf by the stove that came all the way from England. (Tommy grunting faintly) - Go on! (Tommy snuffling) (foot whacks) - [Oliver] Shut up, kid! Pa told you we'd drown you. (chuckling) (low tense music) - [Doc] What do we got here? (pistol clicks) - Making a house call, Doc? (low plucky music) (wolf howling) - You stay right here. - (chuckling) Let's see if our hero has got any gold teeth. Come on, now, open wide. (furniture bangs) (house rumbling) (Tommy groaning frantically) - Pa! (house booms) There's something under the house, Pa. - Go see what it is. - All by myself? - Take Oliver with you! And hurry up, the town treasures await us. Go on! Get outta here. Oliver, go on! - Yeah, Oliver. (tense plunky music) (crickets chirping) - Hey! Catch this! (log thuds) (Percey yells) - Pa! Pa! Help us, Pa! Help, Pa! Help! (Zeke mumbling) Pa, help! (Tommy mumbling frantically) - Shut up, kid! (tense quirky music) (door thumps) (doorknob rattling) (door crashes) (tense music grows) (gun clicks) (tense music cuts) (laughs) - It, it appears, Mr. Giant, that there's been some grievous falsehood spread about my impeccable character. (gun thuds) (Hezekiah laughs) Perhaps it would be advantageous for you and me to sit down and share a glass of port. Like the gentleman we are. (blow thumps) (chair clatters) (laughing) Wha-what an impulsive thing for me to do. (laughs) Sometimes I just don't know what comes over me. Same, shame. (chuckles nervously) I hope you'll accept my apologies, and it would seem incumbent for me to take my leave. (footsteps shuffling) (window shatters) (ground thuds) (Mrs. Macgruder gasps) (Tommy groaning frantically) (Hezekiah panting) (Hezekiah grunts) (Oliver and Percey mumbling angrily) (Hezekiah sighs) You're on your own, boys. (Percey mumbling desperately) - Eli! He went that way! - Amy, go inside the house. (footsteps thumping hurriedly) (crickets chirping) (leaves crunching) (tense plodding music) (horses whinnying) (tense music quickens) (hooves thundering) (posse yelling) - In there! They went in there. Eli and the carnival men went into the woods. - All right, boys, let's dismount. Spread out! Let's get 'em! - Let's go, boys! - [Alicia] Are you all right? - I'm all right. We're all all right. (tense music softens) (posse hollering) - Now watch your step here. - We'll cover you from behind. - All right! - Slow down a little bit. - [Zeke] I'm getting hungry. (posse hollering) (low tense music) (bear roars) (bear growls) (footsteps plodding) (Hezekiah panting) (tense music grows) (bear roaring) (Hezekiah whimpering) (bear roars) (feet pounding) - I surrender. Please save me. Please. (Hezekiah yelping) Save me, save me. Please save me. Save me. Save me. Don't let him eat me. (bear growling) Oh, please, don't let him eat me. Save me. (whimpering) Save me. Please, save me! Save me. (shrieking) Save me. (bear roars) Save me. Please save me. (tense music rises) (Hezekiah panting) (posse yelling distantly) (tense music relaxes) (posse hollering) - [Henderson] Easy, easy, easy, big fella. We ain't after you. Mobbs. Yeah. - Oh, no, no. (Hezekiah sputtering) - They stuck me in a sack, Ma. They said they would sell me to a sea captain in San Francisco. They said if I make any noise, they'd drown me! - Oh, Eli, I was so worried about you. I'm glad you're all right. (Eli groans) (ground thuds) - Let's get him to my office. - No. Get him to my house. (soft serene music) The kids are really gonna miss you, Eli. - [Eli] I'm gonna miss all of them, too. - Take this with you. It's fresh bandages and some cookies. (group singing faintly) - Eli! ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ - Mr. Eli, the whole town's beholden to you. - What we're trying to say is we're sorry, sorry about everything that's happened. - Yes, and we want to help you rebuild everything. - And we'd kinda like for you to, to be our sheriff. - Eli, I was wrong. Folks would like you to stay around. - I'm going back up the mountain. - But Eli. (Alicia shushing) - We don't want you to leave, Eli. - Do you have to go? - I have to go. (soft wistful music) - Eli. I love you. - I understand. (wistful music swells) (moves to soaring uplifting music) (moves to soft peaceful music) - [Narrator] I didn't know then if Eli'd come back to town someday, or if I'd ever see him again. To most folks in our town, he'd become big, ole Eli. To some, he stayed a legend. But to me, he'll always be the giant of Thunder Mountain.
