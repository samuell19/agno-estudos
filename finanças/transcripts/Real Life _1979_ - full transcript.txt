[ Crowd Murmuring ] [ Tapping ] HELLO.... AND WELCOME. I'M COUNCILMAN EDMUND HARRIS OF THE FIFTH DISTRICT. [ Applauding ] I'M SURE SOME OF YOU KNOW WE'RE GATHERED HERE THIS AFTERNOON... TO DEDICATE THE BEGINNING OF A YEAR LONG PROJECT: TO MAKE A MOVIE RIGHT HERE IN PHOENIX AND THE OUTLYING AREAS, AND MUCH OF IT IN OUR OWN FIFTH DISTRICT. [ Applause ] THE FIFTH DISTRICT IS THE HOME OF OUR GOOD FRIENDS, THE YEAGER FAMILY: WARREN, JEANETTE, CUTE LITTLE LISA AND ERIC. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE STARS OF THIS UNUSUAL MOVIE. [ Murmuring ] WAIT A MINUTE. ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM ARE GOING TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE PICTURE TOO. MY WIFE TELLS ME I'M NOT HANDSOME ENOUGH... TO BE IN THE MOVIES. BUT OUR GUEST OF HONOR HERE TODAY SAYS THAT'S BALONEY. HE'S THE GENTLEMAN BEHIND THE WHOLE THING. QUITE A GENTLEMAN HE IS. WHY, HE'S MADE ME LAUGH ON... "THE TONIGHT SHOW," THE LATE ED SULLIVAN. AND I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN HIS SHORT FILMS ON NBC's "GOOD NIGHT SATURDAY." A LOT OF YOU HAVE SEEN HIM ON YOUR FAVORITE SHOWS, I'M SURE. AND IF YOU LIKE THE FOOD WE HAD TODAY, YOU HAVE HIM TO THANK. SO WOULD YOU PLEASE WELCOME WITH A BIG PHOENIX APPLAUSE, ALL THE WAY FROM HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA, MR. ALBERT BROOKS ! THANK YOU, COUNCILMAN HARRIS. PLEASE TELL THE MAYOR I WISH HIM A SPEEDY RECOVERY. I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING SOME EXPRESSIONS OF SHOCK OR DISBELIEF, OR WHATEVER IT WAS YOU WERE DOING, WHEN THE COUNCILMAN MENTIONED THAT THE YEAGERS... WERE GOING TO BE THE STARS OF A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE. MANY OF YOU KNOW WARREN YEAGER IS A FINE VETERINARIAN... AND NOT A PROFESSIONAL ACTOR. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT. WE'RE GATHERED HERE THIS AFTERNOON TO FILM WARREN AND HIS FAMILY, AND YOU FOLKS AND OURSELVES AS WELL, BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING A MOVIE ABOUT REALITY. I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF COMING OUT OF A MOTION PICTURE THEATER... AND SAYING TO YOURSELVES, "I'VE HAD MORE INTERESTING THINGS HAPPEN TO ME... "THAN HAPPENED TO THOSE CHARACTERS IN THAT PICTURE. MY LIFE IS MUCH MORE INTERESTING." YOU KNOW SOMETHING ? YOU'RE RIGHT. THE MOST HILARIOUS COMEDY, THE MOST GRIPPING DRAMA, THE MOST SUSPENSEFUL DISASTERS, THEY DON'T HAPPEN ON THE MOVIE SCREEN. THEY HAPPEN IN MY BACKYARD AND YOURS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO, PLEASE, JUST REMEMBER TWO SIMPLE WORDS... AND EVERYTHING WILL BE PERFECT. BE YOURSELVES. IF YOU SEE OUR CAMERAMAN FOLLOWING WARREN OR JEANETTE, OR ONE OF THE CHILDREN... INTO YOUR HOMES, OFFICES, CLEANING ESTABLISHMENTS OR GAS STATIONS, DON'T TRY TO DO ANYTHING SPECIAL. IT'S TEMPTING TO SHOW OFF FOR THE CAMERA. I KNOW. I MAKE MY LIVING THAT WAY. BUT IN THIS CASE, WE DON'T WANT A SHOW. LET ME CORRECT MYSELF. WE WANT THE GREATEST SHOW OF ALL: LIFE ! HEY, YOU'RE GREAT ! YOU'RE GREAT ! WE'RE GONNA HAVE A B-A-L-L HERE. I GUARANTEE YOU. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TERMED THIS PROJECT AN EXPERIMENT, AND I CAN'T DISAGREE. WHAT EXPERIMENT WOULD BE COMPLETE... WITHOUT THE SCIENTISTS, HMM ? I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE TWO OF THE FINEST... PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSULTANTS THAT MONEY CAN BUY. AND I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO GET THE IMPRESSION WE'RE BUYING EITHER OF THESE GENTLEMEN. [ Laughing ] ACTUALLY, THE ONE ON THE END IS RENTED, AND THE GENTLEMAN SITTING NEXT TO HIM IS LEASED. [ Laughter ] NO, I'M KIDDING. THE GENTLEMAN ON THE END-- WHAT CAN I SAY ? HE'S FROM ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS INSTITUTES WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY. FROM BOULDER, COLORADO, FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR, WOULD YOU WELCOME DR. HOWARD HILL. [ Applauding ] AND THE GENTLEMAN SITTING NEXT TO HIM-- WHAT CAN I SAY ? YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN HIM ON SOME TELEVISION SHOWS. A WELL-KNOWN AUTHOR. HE'S WRITTEN BOOKS. FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, PLEASE GIVE A NICE WELCOME TO DR. TED CLEARY. [ Applauding ] A LOT OF YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT TED DIDN'T STAND UP. ACTUALLY, HE IS STANDING. ISN'T THAT GREAT ? HE EATS VERY LITTLE. [ Laughter ] YOU FOLKS LOVE TO LAUGH, DON'T YOU ? WELL, MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD, I'D LOVE TO GET INTO SOME HUMOR WITH YOU, BUT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THE TIME. WE'RE MEETING THE YEAGERS AT THE AIRPORT IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR. SO BEFORE YOURS TRULY HAS TO SKIDADDLE OUT OF HERE, I'D LIKE, IF I COULD, TO SHARE MY SENTIMENTS I HAVE... ABOUT THIS BEAUTIFUL CITY WITH YOU, IF I MIGHT. MORT ! LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, THE MAN AT THE PIANO, MR. MORT LINDSAY... FROM "THE MERV GRIFFIN SHOW."

SO MANY OF US GO THROUGH LIFE DOING ONE THING AND DREAMING OF DOING SOMETHING ELSE. I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. I'M IN SHOW BUSINESS. I'M FORTUNATE TO HAVE THAT JOB, BUT QUITE FRANKLY, IF I'D STUDIED HARDER OR BEEN GRADED MORE FAIRLY, I WOULD HAVE BEEN A SCIENTIST OR A DOCTOR OF SOME KIND. WELL, THE FULFILLMENT OF THAT DREAM FINALLY HAPPENED FOR ME... WHEN I ARRIVED HERE AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR, A FEW MILES SOUTHWEST OF BOULDER, COLORADO. I KNEW FROM THE INCEPTION OF THIS MOTION PICTURE... THAT WITHOUT SCIENTIFIC GUIDANCE FROM A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED RESEARCH ORGANIZATION, VERY FEW PEOPLE WOULD TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. HOWEVER, WITH THAT GUIDANCE... WE NOT ONLY HAD A CHANCE AT WINNING AN OSCAR, BUT POSSIBLY A NOBEL PRIZE TOO. OOH ! IT GIVES ME THE CHILLS. LET'S GO INSIDE. COME ON. [ Brooks Narrating ] THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE RESPONDED TO THE ADVERTISEMENTS... SCIENTIFICALLY PLACED BY THE INSTITUTE. THEY FILLED OUT PRELIMINARY QUESTIONNAIRES IN THE PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN HOMES. THEN, THE 210 BEST FAMILIES WERE INVITED HERE FOR FINAL TESTING. THESE TESTS IN BOULDER WERE DESIGNED TO CHOOSE THE ONE FAMILY UNIT... THAT COULD BEST REFLECT DAY-TO-DAY LIVING IN CONTEMPORARY AMERICA, AND AT THE SAME TIME... HOLD A MOTION PICTURE AUDIENCE COMPLETELY SPELLBOUND. DURING THE TIME THEY STAYED HERE, THE 210 FAMILIES UNDERWENT MORE THAN 145 SEPARATE TESTS, TOTALING MORE THAN 2,500 TEST HOURS. IF THESE TESTS COULD BE CONVERTED INTO EGGS, IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO FEED A CITY THE SIZE OF ST. LOUIS FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS... ON A TWO-EGG-PER-PERSON PER WEEK BASIS. SOUND COMPLICATED ? IT WAS, AND VERY EXPENSIVE. HOWEVER, EVEN THOUGH WE WERE PAYING FOR THIS, FOR TOP SECURITY REASONS... THE INSTITUTE ALLOWED US TO FILM JUST A SMALL PORTION... OF A FEW OF THE TESTS. HONEY, I COMPLETELY BELIEVE THAT. [ Brooks Narrating ] TEST 40, ONE OF THREE ROLE REVERSAL EXERCISES. THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE: BE SOMEONE ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY. THIS TEST WAS INVALUABLE, NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE INSIGHTS IT GAVE INTO RELATIONSHIPS, BUT BECAUSE IT SINGLE-HANDEDLY DISCOURAGED 23 FAMILIES FROM FURTHER PARTICIPATION, SAVING US MORE THAN $90,000 IN WASTED TESTING COSTS. I WANNA GO OUT AND PLAY. NO ! YOU HEARD WHAT YOUR MOTHER SAID. YOU HAVE TO STAY IN, DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND BE QUIET ALL DAY. BUT I WANNA GO OUT AND PLAY. NO ! WELL, I WANT TO. I SAID NO ! I SAID YES. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY. I'M THE BOSS. NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING. I DON'T WANNA DO THAT. OKAY, OKAY. HAROLD, STOP IT ! DON'T CALL ME HAROLD, CALL ME "DAD" ! DON'T YOU HIT ME, YOU LITTLE-- [ Shouts ] DAMN YOU ! [ Brooks ] ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, FOLKS. THANK YOU. FOLKS ? [ Brooks Narrating ] THIS WAS TEST 72, ONE OF 15 TESTS... UTILIZING STATE-OF-THE-ART COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY. THIS MAN... WAS FEEDING ALL OF HIS FACIAL FEATURES INTO THIS-- THE GRAPHICON 8,000. THIS AMAZING COMPUTER WOULD ACTUALLY SHOW... WHAT EACH FAMILY MEMBER'S FACE WOULD PHOTOGRAPH LIKE... FROM EVERY CONCEIVABLE ANGLE... AND THEN GIVE US A DIGITAL READOUT OF THEIR SCREEN PRESENCE. [ Buzzing ] OKAY, IT SHOULD BE SIMPLE. [ Brooks Narrating ] TEST 141, KNOWN SIMPLY AS THE DRIVING TEST. SINCE MUCH OF ANYBODY'S LIFE TAKES PLACE IN A CAR, WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE OUR FAMILY WASN'T GOING TO KILL US. DUMMIES, ACTING AS CAMERAMEN, WERE PLACED... IN ONE OF THE 200 CARS IN THE INSTITUTE'S MOBILE TEST FLEET. WHEN I TELL YOU TO START, PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE, BACK IT UP TO THAT SIMULATED GARAGE. GO ? IN REVERSE AND BACK IN THERE. OKAY, FINE. [ Horn Honks ] YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO PUT IT BACK IN THE SIMULATED GARAGE. WHAT SIMULATED GARAGE ? OKAY. WHILE THE TESTING CONTINUED, GROUND RULES FOR THE PROJECT WERE SLOWLY BEING DEVELOPED. MOST IMPORTANT WAS THE UNUSUAL AGREEMENT... THAT ONLY THE STUDIO AND A FEW OF THE DOCTORS AT THE INSTITUTE... WOULD ACTUALLY BE ALLOWED TO SEE THE FILM AS IT WAS BEING SHOT. THE REST OF US WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE YEAR WAS OVER. THIS WAS DONE TO REDUCE POSSIBLE CONFUSION... AND TO HEIGHTEN THE REALITY. BUT, TO REALLY HEIGHTEN THE REALITY, WE NEEDED A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF MOTION PICTURE EQUIPMENT-- EQUIPMENT THAT COULD STAY OUT OF OUR FAMILY'S WAY. TWO SYSTEMS WERE CHOSEN. FIRST, FROM JAPAN, SPECIAL HEAT-SENSING WALL CAMERAS LIKE THIS. THESE WOULD BE INSTALLED WHEREVER FEASIBLE. THESE AMAZING DEVICES ACTUALLY USED BODY HEAT... TO FOCUS IN ON THE NEAREST PERSON. QUIET, EFFICIENT, EXPENSIVE. AND THEN, TO CAPTURE WHAT THOSE COULDN'T, A STARTLING BREAKTHROUGH IN TECHNOLOGY. THE SMALLEST, MOST VERSATILE MOTION PICTURE CAMERA EVER MADE. FROM HOLLAND, THE ENTANOUR 226-XL. THE ETANOUR IS ACTUALLY WORN OVER THE HEAD. THE CAMERA IS CONTROLLED BY USING BODY MOVEMENT, AND BY OPERATING THIS HUMAN EYE-LIKE LENS SYSTEM. [ Whirring ] ISN'T THAT SOMETHING ? AND IT CAN HEAR LIKE A HUMAN TOO... WITH THESE SPECIAL OMNI-DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONES... LOCATED EXACTLY WHERE WE HAVE OUR EARS. THE ETANOUR NEEDS NO SPECIAL LIGHTING. AND IT USES NO FILM. YES, ALL PICTURE AND SOUND INFORMATION... IS RECORDED DIGITALLY ON THESE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIPS, SOME NO LARGER THAN A CHILD'S FINGERNAIL. WHEN THESE CHIPS ARE FILLED TO CAPACITY, THEY WILL BE REMOVED FROM THIS HOUSING, AND THEN MAILED BACK TO THE INSTITUTE, WHERE THEY'RE DECODED AND THEN TRANSFERRED TO FILM AS WE KNOW IT. ONLY SIX OF THESE CAMERAS WERE EVER MADE. ONLY FIVE OF THEM EVER WORKED. WE HAD FOUR OF THOSE. AFTER SIX WEEKS OF TESTING, THE FAMILIES HAD BEEN NARROWED DOWN TO TWO: THE ANDREW FELTONS FROM GREEN BAY, WISCONSIN, AND THE WARREN YEAGERS FROM PHOENIX, ARIZONA. USING THE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT AND THE INSTITUTE'S DIRECT-MAIL FACILITY, THE OTHER HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES WERE NOTIFIED... THAT THEY WERE UNSUITABLE. SINCE THESE TWO FINALISTS HAD NEVER MET BEFORE, EACH FAMILY SERVED AS A MATCHING SET OF STRANGERS FOR THE OTHER. THEY WERE GIVEN ONLY ONE INSTRUCTION FOR THE HOUR-LONG ENCOUNTER: BE YOURSELVES. YOU'RE WITH T.W.A. ? NO, AMERICAN. OH, UH-HUH. YOU GET TO FLY FOR FREE, DON'T YOU ? WE HAVE TO PAY TAX. HOW MUCH IS THE TAX TO EUROPE ? I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY. ARE THERE A MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF TRIPS YOU CAN TAKE ? OH, YES. SOUNDS GREAT. OH, YES. TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK, WE COULD FIND NO DIFFERENCE. OUR RESEARCH WAS SO THOROUGH, THE COMPUTERS ACTUALLY COUGHED UP TWO PERFECT FAMILIES. IF I WERE A LIAR, I COULD TELL YOU WE CHOSE ONE OVER THE OTHER... FOR COMPLICATED PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS. BUT I'M A COMEDIAN, NOT A LIAR. I CAN AFFORD THE LUXURY OF HONESTY. THE FELTONS LIVED IN WISCONSIN. THE YEAGERS LIVED IN ARIZONA. YOU SPEND THE WINTER IN WISCONSIN. [ All Laughing ] [ Brooks Narrating ] PHOENIX ! POPULATION: ALMOST ONE MILLION PEOPLE. THE FASTEST GROWING METROPOLIS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI. THE YEAGERS LIVED HERE, IN ONE OF THE NEWER SECTIONS OF TOWN, PART OF THE FIFTH DISTRICT. THEIR HOUSE WAS LOCATED AT THE END OF A CUL-DE-SAC... CALLED VIEW CREST HEIGHTS DRIVE. WARREN YEAGER WORKED HERE AT THE ARIZONA VETERINARY CLINIC, ONE OF THE FINEST VETERINARY HOSPITALS IN THE NEW SOUTHWEST. THE CHILDREN ATTENDED SCHOOL AT BENJAMIN FRANKLIN GRAMMAR SCHOOL, ABOUT TWO MILES FROM THE FAMILY'S HOME. I WAS FORTUNATE TO PURCHASE THE HOUSE... DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE YEAGERS. IT WAS THE FIRST HOUSE I HAD EVER OWNED, AND I MUST SAY, I WAS PROUD. THAT'S IT. THIS MAN, HOWEVER, WOULD NOT STOP SHAKING MY HAND. THE YEAGERS WERE SENT ON A TWO-WEEK, ALL-EXPENSE-PAID TRIP TO HAWAII... SO I COULD GET SETTLED IN WITHOUT DISTURBING THEM. I KNEW THE HOUSE HAD TO BE FURNISHED WITH GREAT CARE. [ Horn Honking ] WE'RE HERE ! [ Brooks Narrating ] THE LIVING ROOM WAS DONE IN A NEO-MEDITERRANEAN STYLE. THE PLAYROOM WAS DONE CONTEMPORARY, WITH A FUN TOUCH. LET'S PUT IT OUTSIDE. AND THE SLEEPING AREA-- WELL, WITH THIS ROUND BED AND LARGE SCREEN TV, LET'S JUST SAY IF THERE WERE ANY SINGLE GIRLS IN PHOENIX, I'D FIND THEM. THE REST OF THE CREW STAYED HERE AT THE TRAVEL LODGE, A NICE PLACE. BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THE CREW, FOR AT THIS VERY MOMENT... A 707 WAS LANDING NONSTOP FROM HAWAII... WITH OUR STARS ABOARD. IT'S NOT DEGRADING. WHAT'S DEGRADING ABOUT BEING INTRODUCED ? WERE YOU DEGRADED ? THERE'S SUCH A THING AS PROFESSIONAL DIGNITY. WHY WERE YOU SINGING ? YOU WERE JUST SUPPOSED TO INFORM THEM OF THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT. I DID INFORM 'EM. WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT MAKING THEM HAPPY ? THEY LOVED THE SONG. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, HOWARD, BUT I DIDN'T GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL FOR FIVE YEARS... TO BE INTRODUCED AS A PART OF AN ACT. AN ACT ! HOWARD, YOU'VE SEEN ME WORK. THAT'S NOT MY ACT, TED. AN ACT'S A DETAILED THING. FIRST YOU'VE GOT A SET OPENING, THEN YOU'VE GOT A THREE, FOUR MINUTE HUNK. YOU FOLLOW THAT WITH A TEN MINUTE HUNK. [ Warren ] MR. BROOKS. ALBERT. SOMEONE KNOWS ME IN PHOENIX. HI. HOW ARE YOU ? IT'S WARREN. WE'RE IN BAGGAGE ! WE MISSED THE PLANE. GREAT, GOOD. WE'RE COMING ! I GOT MIXED UP MYSELF. I THOUGHT THE PLANE-- HEY ! HELLO ! WE MISSED YOU ! HE BARELY KNOWS ME. WELCOME HOME ! ALOHA ! LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THIS. REAL ORCHIDS. HELLO, MRS. YEAGER. AND YOU. LOOK AT THIS. COME HERE. LOOK AT THAT. OKAY ! DO WE KNOW EVERYBODY ? THESE ARE THE ETANOURS. I THINK YOU READ THE LITERATURE ON THEM. THESE ARE MY TWO PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSULTANTS. THEY'RE GONNA BE WITH US FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR, MAKING SURE EVERYTHING IS PERFECT. DID YOU MEET HOWARD AT THE INSTITUTE ? I DON'T THINK SO. DR. HOWARD HILL. HE'S FROM THE INSTITUTE. THIS GENTLEMAN IS GONNA BE WITH US THE ENTIRE YEAR ? YES, HE IS. I WON'T BE DEGRADING. I'LL DO IT RIGHT THIS TIME. I'M DR. TED CLEARY. I'M NOT A CONSULTANT, I'M MORE OF AN OBSERVER. I'M WRITING A SERIES OF ARTICLES ON THIS PROJECT FOR THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGY. [ Brooks ] HE'S A WELL-KNOWN AUTHOR. WRITTEN LOTS OF BOOKS. YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO PUBLISH THE ARTICLES HE'S WRITING ? DID YOU TELL HIM ? - I DID TELL HIM. -THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGY. MAYBE THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL IN THE WORLD. I SWEAR TO GOD. YOU KNOW WHO READS THESE THINGS ? JONAS SALK, BUCKMINSTER FULLER, WILLIAM BUCKLEY, EVERY SCIENTIST LIVING. THEY GO TO THE MAILBOX, THEY GET IT LIKE MAGAZINES. WE'RE ALL GONNA BE ON JONAS SALK'S COFFEE TABLE. ALL RIGHT ! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT ? HE LOVES IT. ONE LAST THING, THEN I'M STAYING OUT OF YOUR LIVES. LIMO BACK TO THE HOUSE. JUST A SPECIAL TREAT. COME ON, LET'S GO TO THE LIMO ! I WANNA TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE WENT TO MAUI. JEANETTE DIDN'T WANT TO GO, BUT I TOLD HER-- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ? GET THIS LUGGAGE MYSELF ? EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY, REALLY. I'M SORRY. I'M A LITTLE EXCITED. YOU'RE COMPLETELY OUT OF IT. COME ON ! COME ON ! OKAY ! WE GOT THE WHOLE CREW WAITIN' ! OKAY. COME ON, HONEY. [ Applauding ] MR. THEODORE CLEARY ! ALL RIGHT, THERE HE IS ! THE YEAGERS ! YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT. LOOK, IT'S YOUR PARENTS. WE FLEW 'EM IN FROM TUCSON. HOW ARE YOU ? OH, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU. ISN'T THIS PERFECT ? OKAY, VERY QUICKLY. OH, THAT'S-- LOVE REUNIONS. VERY QUICKLY, FOLKS. WE WANT TO MEET YOUR CREW. WE LINED 'EM ALL UP. WE'LL DO IT JUST LIKE THEY MEET ROYALTY. NOW, DR. AND MRS. YEAGER, ERIC, LISA. WE'LL GO DOWN THE LINE. THIS IS WARDROBE. TRUCKER. CAMERAMAN. FIRST A.D. SECOND A.D. WHAT'S AN A.D. ? ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. WE'LL GET TO IT IN A SECOND. ANOTHER TRUCKER. WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE'S NAMES ? NOT IMPORTANT. LET ME GET THROUGH THE LIST. - WARDROBE. SCRIPT. - SCRIPT ? IS THERE A SCRIPT ? NO, THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE PACKAGE. CAMERAMAN. ANOTHER CAMERAMAN. GRIP. GRIP. HOW DO YOU DO ? HELLO. THIS IS A TRUCKER. THIS IS A GOPHER, THIS IS A GOPHER-- WHERE ? WHERE ? NO, ERIC, THESE PEOPLE HERE. IT'S A TERM, OKAY ? PUBLICITY. THIS IS A TRUCKER, DRIVER AND A TRUCKER. OKAY ? THERE'S A FEW OTHER PEOPLE. THEY'RE NOT HERE RIGHT NOW. OF COURSE, THANKS TO MODERN TECHNOLOGY, THESE PEOPLE REALLY AREN'T NEEDED, BUT THE UNION MAKES US TAKE 'EM. SO, FOLKS, WE'LL SEE YOU AT THE PREMIERE, HUH ? HAVE A NICE TIME IN PHOENIX ! ENJOY YOUR STAY. THANKS FOR COMING. GET GOOD TANS. NICE TO SEE YA. SEE YA AGAIN. NICE TO SEE YA. HAVE A GOOD STAY. SEE YOU NEXT YEAR. NICE TO SEE YA. OKAY ? SO, WHAT CAN I TELL YOU ? WELCOME HOME. YOU WANNA FILM SOMETHING OF US COMING OUT OF THE CAR ? YOU KIND OF LOOK TIRED. WHY DON'T YOU GO IN YOUR HOUSE ? MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME, ALL RIGHT ? I WANT TO GO OVER THE RULES, BUT WE CAN DO THAT AND THE FILMING SCHEDULE LATER. YOU SURE ? HE JUST SAID SO, DIDN'T HE ? OKAY ? SO BREAK A LEG ! BE YOURSELVES ! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. THOSE LEIS KEEP. PUT 'EM IN THE FREEZER. OKAY. THANK YOU. HAVE A GOOD TIME NOW. BE YOURSELVES ! THEY LOOK GREAT. THEY'RE GREAT. THEY'RE GREAT. [ Brooks Narrating ] THEY WERE GREAT. WHAT A FAMILY. THE LONG TRIP FROM HAWAII DID LEAVE THEM A BIT FATIGUED, HOWEVER. ESPECIALLY MRS. YEAGER, WHO THOUGHT SHE HAD A SLIGHT FEVER. ALTHOUGH DR. YEAGER SAID IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT TO FILM THEM UNPACKING, I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO GIVE THEM AN HOUR BY THEMSELVES... TO RELAX AND GET READY FOR DINNER. I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO FINISH ANTIQUING MY END TABLE. "CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR OLDEST EFFECT." THE HOUR PASSED VERY QUICKLY. AND BEFORE I KNEW IT, WE WERE READY TO JOIN THEM... FOR THEIR FIRST SUPPER. EAT YOUR PIZZA, HONEY. GOOD PIZZA. HONEY, DO YOU THINK IT'S SAFE... FOR YOU TO BE EATING WITH YOUR HEATING PAD IN YOUR LAP ? I HAVE TERRIBLE CRAMPS, I AM BLEEDING PROFUSELY... AND I WANT TO VOMIT ON THE TABLE. [ Laughs ] [ Jeanette ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? I JUST WANNA LET THEM KNOW THIS IS NOT THE WAY... WE USUALLY TALK, ESPECIALLY AT THE DINNER TABLE. OKAY. WHY DON'T WE-- WHY DON'T WE JUST, UH, PRETEND THAT WE JUST SAT DOWN, AND WE CAN START OVER, OKAY ? GREAT PIZZA, HUH, KIDS ? KIDS ? I HATE IT. YOU HATE IT. [ Laughs ] OH ! ERIC. GODDAMN IT, ERIC ! WATCH YOUR MOUTH, YOUNG LADY. THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF LANGUAGE WE USE AT THE DINNER TABLE. SINCE WHEN HAVE WE HAD ALL THESE RULES AT THE DINNER TABLE ? - LISA, DON'T USE MY GOOD LINEN NAPKIN TO WIPE THAT UP ! - WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO USE ? -THERE ARE NO OTHER NAPKINS IN THE HOUSE. -THERE ARE NAPKINS IN THE HOUSE. HONEY, YOUR MOTHER'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. IF YOU GET SMART WITH HER AGAIN, I'M GONNA HAVE TO PUNISH YOU. DO YOU UNDERSTAND, HONEY ? I HATE IT IN HERE ! YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT HERE. IF YOU DIDN'T, THERE'D BE PLENTY MORE FOOD FOR THE REST OF US. DON'T START MAKING HER FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THE FOOD. GOD, YOU MAKE ME SICK. BECAUSE I STICK UP FOR YOU ? ERIC, WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE THE TOWEL ? WANNA TAKE YOUR PIZZA INTO YOUR ROOM ? TAKE YOUR PIZZA INTO YOUR ROOM AND WATCH SOME TV. OKAY ? OKAY. WHY DOES HE HAVE TO FINISH HIS DINNER IN THE OTHER ROOM ? I THOUGHT HE COULD HAVE MORE FUN EATING THERE. OH, HE CAN'T HAVE FUN HERE ? IT'S HARD TO HAVE FUN WHEN YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER... WHINING ABOUT HER TERRIBLE MENSTRUAL CRAMPS EVERY DAY. I MEAN, EVERY DAY. I AGREE. AND IT IS ALSO NOT MUCH FUN TO HAVE AN I.U.D. STUCK IN YOU... TO PREVENT, AS YOU PUT IT, MORE MOUTHS TO FEED. [ Chuckles ] I-- LOOK, I NEVER SAID THAT. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAID. I AM HAVING THIS COIL TAKEN OUT MONDAY. AND FROM NOW ON, IF YOU WANT SAFE SEX, YOU CAN HAVE IT WITH ONE OF YOUR ANIMALS ! I KNOW YOU DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BY THAT, SO I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING, I'M JUST, UH-- YOU'RE JUST UPSET, THE WAY EVERYBODY GETS. [ Door Slams Shut ] WHAT A GREAT DAY, HUH ? SOUNDS REAL EXCITING OVER THERE, DOESN'T IT ? YOU BEEN OUT SPYING ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD ? I'M NOT SPYING ON ANYBODY. I LIVE HERE. I'M ALLOWED TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE STREET. WHAT'D YOU THINK, HOWARD ? REAL GOOD ACTION FOR DAY ONE. REAL GOOD. WELL, TENSION, NOT ACTION. TENSION IS ACTION. DON'T YOU EVER GO TO PLAYS ? WHAT'D YOU THINK, TED ? SOME GOOD INSIGHTS FOR YOU ? IF I WERE RUNNING THIS PROJECT, THOSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN SOME REST TONIGHT AND DAY ONE WOULD'VE BEEN TOMORROW. WE ALL PRETTY MUCH AGREED AT THE MEETING THAT WHEN THEY GOT OFF THE PLANE, THAT WAS THE BEGINNING. ABSOLUTELY ! WE ALL PRETTY MUCH AGREED, BUT I DISAGREED. LOOK, IT'S DONE. IT'S ON FILM. I THINK WE GOTTA KEEP REMEMBERING, WHATEVER WE DO IS FINE, IT'S PERFECT, IT'S THE MOVIE. OH, GREAT. IT MAY BE FINE AND PERFECT, BUT THAT ADDED TENSION IS MAKING YOUR LEADING MAN COME OFF VERY UNSYMPATHETIC. WHAT ? THAT'S ONLY MY OBSERVATION. NO, HE'S VERY SYMPATHETIC. IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT IT FROM THE DRAMATIC POINT, YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT. HERE'S A GUY. HE'S GOT A WIFE, TWO KIDS. HE'S THREATENED BY SOCIETY. OH, COME ON NOW ! NO ! ON ONE HAND, HE DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES HIS PARENTS MADE. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S NOT SO SURE HIS PARENTS MADE MISTAKES. HE'S TORN. MAYBE HE LIKES HIMSELF, MAYBE HE DOESN'T. JESUS, I THINK IT'S A HELL OF A COMPLEX CHARACTER. DON'T YOU THINK SO, HOWARD ? HE'S COMPLEX. HE'S FINE. JUST RELAX. I AM RELAXED ! I DON'T LIKE MY LEADING MAN BEING CALLED UNSYMPATHETIC ON THE BASIS OF 4 MINUTES OF FILM. [ Chuckles ] HE'S GOOD, HUH ? HE'S GOOD. HE WAS GOOD AT THE AIRPORT. HE WAS GOOD ! YEAH. ON ONE HAND HE LIKES HIMSELF, ON THE OTHER HAND HE DOESN'T. HONEY ? HONEY, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM ? THERE'S NO PROBLEM. I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU VERY MUCH RIGHT NOW. CRAMPS IS A BAD BEGINNING FOR YOUR MOVIE, SO I'M GONNA SPEND THE WEEKEND AT BONNIE'S. IT'S OUR MOVIE. IT WAS OUR DECISION. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE. WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN ? THE CHILDREN KNOW. I'M SURE THEY COULD FILM YOUR BETTER MOMENTS. DON'T MAKE ME GET IN AN ARGUMENT. THERE'S NO ARGUMENT. AFTER ALL, THEY'RE PAYING FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW. HONEY, YOU WANTED THIS AS MUCH AS I DID. YOU'LL BENEFIT FROM IT TOO. WARREN, WILL YOU PLEASE-- [ Car Door Closes, Motor Revving ] LATCH ONTO JEANETTE ! HELLO, MRS. YEAGER ! WHERE YOU GOING ? LISTEN, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO GO BE ALONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I THINK I NEED TO BE ALONE NOW. CAN WE COME WITH YOU ? NO, I REALLY WANT TO BE ALONE. WELL-- JUST BY MYSELF. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS THING LATER BECAUSE THIS WASN'T IN THE RULES. IT'S ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD. WOULD YOU TAKE THE LITTLE CAR ? WE'RE GONNA DRIVE TO WORK WITH WARREN. WE'D LIKE TO USE THE STATION WAGON. IT'S JUST HARD TO FIT BOTH... CAMERAS IN THERE. COULD ONE PERSON COME WITH YOU ? NO. ONE ? THAT'S ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD. PLEASE ? I NEED TO BE BY MYSELF. OKAY. I UNDERSTAND. THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM IN HERE IF WE JUST-- ONE-- [ Engine Revving ] [ Tires Screeching ] IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO BEYOND THE ORIGINAL YEAR... TO MAKE UP THESE DAYS, IT'S OKAY. NO, I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND. THERE'S NO MAKING UP DAYS. THIS IS THE REALITY. THIS IS IT. SHE LEFT. THAT'S REAL. EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS-- EVEN US NOW-- IT'S ALL-- IT'S ALL THE REALITY. VERY GOOD. SHE CAME OUT ANGRY LIKE THAT. GOT RIGHT IN THE CAR. YOU FOLLOWED HER. ALL VERY GOOD STUFF. VERY, VERY GOOD. REALLY. I SHOULD JUST GO ON LIVING AS USUAL ? MM-HMM. THAT'S IT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING. YOU'RE VERY GOOD. THANKS.

SO HE SAYS, "YOU THINK THAT'S BAD, HER SISTER'S TWICE AS FAT." [ Laughing ] AH. OVER HERE. THE INSTITUTE AND I AGREED THAT PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH ANY FAMILY MEMBERS... SHOULD BE DISCOURAGED, BUT THIS DID SOUND IMPORTANT. I WAS HOPING WE COULD BE ALONE. THIS IS ALONE. THIS IS ALONE AS I EVER GET. HOW WAS YOUR WEEKEND ? OH, IT WAS OKAY. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THAT TIME. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THE MOVIE IS TO YOU. I'M SORRY. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I MEAN, IT'S IMPORTANT. I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT. BUT IT'S A DECISION, AND I MADE IT. IT WAS A LOVING DECISION. OH, GOD, NO. NO LOVE. IT'S JUST A DECISION. I'M MAKING 'EM ALL THE TIME. WHAT'S UP ? WHY'D YOU WANT TO MEET ME ? I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I LIKE YOU, AND THAT THIS MOVIE DOES MEAN AS MUCH TO ME AS IT DOES TO EVERYBODY ELSE. I HOPE I DIDN'T HURT ANYTHING. OH, NO, NO. NOTHING CAN HURT IT. THAT'S THE BEAUTY PART OF THIS FILM. IT IS WHAT IT IS. IT'S LIKE A MOVIE IN A MOVIE, IN A MOVIE, IN A MOVIE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ? WELL, YOU WERE VERY SWEET, AND I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU IN RETURN. OH, DON'T. NO, REALLY, I WANT TO. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY GYNECOLOGIST... FOR A QUARTER TO 10:00 TOMORROW MORNING.

I'M SURE THAT IN A MONTH OR TWO IT WOULD BE FINE, YOU KNOW. BUT RIGHT NOW HE'S A LITTLE UPSET AND-- SINCE IT WASN'T PLANNED-- I JUST-- I THINK HE WOULD SAY NO... AND WE WOULD JUST GET INTO ANOTHER ARGUMENT. [ Crying ] AND I'M REAL TIRED OF ARGUING WITH HIM. OOH, LOOK-- GO HOME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.

SEE IF YOU CAN DETACH YOURSELF FOR A MINUTE. LOOK AT IT FROM THE DRAMATIC POINT. HERE'S A GUY. HE'S GOT A WIFE, TWO KIDS. HE'S THREATENED, YOU KNOW ? THREATENED BY SOCIETY. ON ONE HAND HE'S GOT THE PARENTAL THING, ON THE OTHER HAND HE'S GOT THE PRESSURES OF HIS WORK. AN AUDIENCE HAS GOT TO HAVE SYMPATHY FOR A GUY LIKE THIS. HE'S A VERY COMPLEX GUY. PEOPLE HAVE SYMPATHY FOR A GUY WHO'S COMPLEX. DON'T YOU THINK SO ? THINK ABOUT IT. HE IS COMPLEX, ISN'T HE ? YOU'RE SUCH A SENSITIVE MAN. OH, NO, NO. IT'S JUST A THEORY. I'M NOT, NO. WELL, I WANT YOU TO MEET ME OUTSIDE MY DOCTOR'S BUILDING... AT A QUARTER TO 10:00 TOMORROW MORNING. OKAY. OKAY ? OKAY. I'M GONNA GO HOME NOW. OKAY. YOU GAVE ME THE STRENGTH. THANKS. OH. [ Spits ] I-- I DIDN'T GIVE YOU-- I GAVE YOU NOTHING, MRS. YEAGER. NO, NO, I GAVE YOU NOTHING. DON'T THINK I'M ANYTHING BETTER THAN WHAT YOU HAVE. YOU THINK I'VE GOT THIS CHARISMA, BUT I DON'T ! I REALLY DON'T, MRS. YEAGER. IT'S JUST-- I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF IT, BUT IT JUST SITS ON THE SURFACE. IT DOESN'T RUN DEEP. NO KISSING. DEEPER THAN YOU THINK. I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW. MRS. YEAGER, IT'S BEEN MEASURED. IT DOESN'T RUN DEEP. NO KISSING HERE. I'M A SHALLOWFELLOW. LOOK. SHALLOW, SHALLOW. REALLY ! SHALLOW ! SHE DIDN'T KNOW. WHAT AM I GONNA DO ? I DIDN'T CALL THIS. I DIDN'T DO IT. LET ME JUST... GO OUT OF FRAME THIS WAY. ALL RIGHT. DURING THE EXAMINATION, BASICALLY GET HER EXPRESSIONS. JUST VERY NICE. NO-- WE'RE NOT GONNA SHOOT ANYTHING-- JUST PERFECT. JUST LIKE THIS, HUH ? I TRUST YOU. NO, DON'T. NO TRUST. NO, HONESTLY. SHALLOW. NO. JUST A DECISION. THESE ARE JUST DECISIONS. [ Nurse ] MRS. YEAGER ? THE DOCTOR WILL SEE YOU NOW. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. TASTEFUL. TASTE. JUST REMEMBER. UH, EXCUSE ME. I DON'T THINK THE DOCTOR WOULD LIKE... ANYONE OTHER THAN THE PATIENT IN THE EXAMINING ROOM. OH, THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE. SEE ? WE'RE FILMING HER LIFE, AND WE HAVE HER PERMISSION. SOMEONE FROM MY CREW WAS HERE THIS MORNING AND GOT A RELEASE. NO, NOT TODAY. YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN. I DON'T THINK I'M MISTAKEN. I'LL CHECK. MARGARET, BE WITH YOU IN A FEW MINUTES. MRS. YEAGER, HOW YOU FEELING ? MUCH BETTER, THANK YOU. WHAT ARE THESE ? THESE ARE CAMERAS. OH, NO. OH, GODDAMN IT ! WHAT'S GOING ON ? I WAS CLEARED !

RENNERT, THESE PEOPLE ARE WITH ME. THEY'RE FILMING MY LIFE. I'M SORRY, BUT I'VE HAD SOME BAD EXPERIENCES WITH THE60 MINUTES PEOPLE. NO, WE'RE NOT NEWS. WE'RE NOT DIGGING. I DON'T EVEN ASK QUESTIONS. I'M JUST FILMING HER, AND RIGHT NOW YOU'RE IN THEIR LIFE. THEY'RE INMY LIFE ! MRS. YEAGER, I'M GETTING ANGRY. MY BLOOD PRESSURE'S STARTING TO SOAR. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ? YOU WANT THEM IN HERE ? FINE. THEY CAN TAKE OUT YOUR I.U.D. TWO THORAZINE. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I KNOW WHAT HE WANTS. THIS ISN'T A STUDENT FILM. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ? LOOK. HUH ? THERE'S FOUR OF US HERE, OKAY ? HE WANTS AN ABORTION. ALL RIGHT ? TWO. MAKE IT TWO. I'LL TAKE A HYSTERECTOMY. SHE'LL HAVE THE SAME. HOW ABOUT THIS FOR PARKING ? YOU THINK $500 MIGHT DO IT ? I JUST WANNA FILM HER LIFE. PLEASE, DON'T MAKE TROUBLE. YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME $500 TO FILM AN EXAMINATION ? OH, MY GOD ! MAXWELL RENNERT. THE BABY BROKER ! OH, GODDAMN IT ! GET OUT OF HERE ! I DON'T NEED THIS ! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT ! DIDN'T YOU SEE THAT INCREDIBLE THING MIKE WALLACE DID ON THIS MAN ? SOLD CHILDREN. THEY WERE LIKE BABY SLAVE AUCTIONS. ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ON 60 MINUTESI'VE EVER SEEN ! MIKE WALLACE SENT ME A LETTER OF APOLOGY. I'LL BET. LET'S SEE IT. IT'S OUT BEING PERMA-PLAQUED. YOU GET OUT OF HERE, GODDAMN IT. GO ON, GET OUT. GO ON, OUT. YOU, GET OUT. JUST A MINUTE. [ Brooks ] THIS GUY'S NUTS ! I WANT THIS ! [ Rennert ] LOOK AT ME. MY HANDS ARE SHAKIN' LIKE A 90-YEAR-OLD. [ Snoring ] [ Ringing ] [ Coughing ] [ Ringing ] [ Mumbles ] [ Brooks Coughing ] HELLO ? HI. DID I WAKE YOU ? OH. I FELL ASLEEP FOR A MINUTE. I'M UP THOUGH. HOW ARE YOU ? HOW YOU FEELING ? NOT TOO WELL. LISTEN, MRS. YEAGER. I'M VERY SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY. MAYBE SOMEBODY IN THE CREW CAN HELP YOU FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR. WHAT DO YOU THINK ? NO, THAT'S OKAY. I'M NOT-- THAT'S OKAY. OH, OKAY. HEY, IT'S A NICE SUNNY DAY OUT, HUH ? IS THERE ANYPLACE TO GO HORSEBACK RIDING AROUND HERE ? MY GRANDMOTHER HAD A STROKE THIS MORNING. OH, MY GOD ! THAT'S TERRIBLE. HOW OLD IS SHE ? EIGHTY-ONE. WELL, THAT'S VERY OLD. I MEAN-- THAT'S ALMOST 90. DID YOU TELL WARREN ? NO, NOT YET. OH, MRS. YEAGER, YOU DIDN'T CALL ME FIRST ! YEAH. DON'T DO THAT. SHARE THIS WITH HIM. [ Jeanette ] I HOPE SHE'LL BE OKAY. I JUST-- AW, SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. [ Jeanette ] I HADN'T CALLED IN ABOUT THREE MONTHS. OH ! HONEY ! I JUST-- [ Sobbing ] HI. [ Sobbing Continues ] GOTTA GO ! YOU CRY IT THROUGH, MRS. YEAGER. BE ALONE. SHARE IT WITH HER HUSBAND. SHE CALLED ME. WHAT ARE YOU WRITING ? JUST SOME NOTES. TED, SHE CALLED ME. WHAT KIND OF NOTES ? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EFFORT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING TO STAY OUT OF THEIR LIVES ? TED, SHE CALLED ME. TED DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. TED ! TED ! [ Chuckles ] TED ! TED, LOOK, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING HERE. IT'S ONLY THE FIRST WEEK, AND SHE SEEMS TO BE RELYING ON YOU QUITE A BIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? WHY DIDN'T SHE CALL HER HUSBAND ? ASK HER THAT. I'M NOT THE INDIAN RUBBER MAN. MY ARM DIDN'T SLITHER ACROSS THE STREET, DIAL HER PHONE... AND THEN SNAP BACK IN. IS THEJOURNAL GONNA PRINT I'M INTERFERING BECAUSE I TOOK A CALL ? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEJOURNAL'S GONNA PRINT. TED, WE'VE GOT TO LIGHTEN UP HERE. HER GRANDMOTHER HAD A STROKE. MM-HMM. YOU KNOW, I'M WONDERING IF MAYBE YOU'RE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE-- WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S PHOENIX AND YOU'RE... THE ONLY-- WELL, YOU KNOW. THERE'S NOT A, A LOT OF-- IT'S PHOENIX. THERE'S-- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY ? Y-YOU'RE, YOU'RE-- YOU'RE THE ONLY-- ALBERT, YOU HAVE MORE TROUBLE DEALING WITH A BLACK PERSON... THAN ANY WHITE MAN I HAVE EVER MET. [ Sighs ] I BEG YOUR PARDON ? HEY, BLACK MEETS WHITE. TED, I'M NOT TRYING TO DO ANYTHING. I'M JUST TRYING TO TUNE IN ON YOUR PARTICULAR LEVEL OF ANXIETY. THAT'S ALL. BOOGIE ! BOOGIE ! BOO ! TED, STOP DISTORTING-- NO, I'M NOT BLACK, NOR DO I CLAIM TO BE. YES, THERE'S FEARS, MISUNDERSTANDINGS, AND ALL THAT OTHER MUMBO-JUMBO, BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS PROJECT. I KNOW MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE THAT YOU PEOPLE ARE GONNA TAKE OVER THE EARTH, OKAY ? YOU'RE STRONGER, FASTER. YOU USE HEAT BETTER. YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE NEXT CENTURY WRAPPED UP. I KNOW ABOUT AFRICA. IT'S SEETHING. BOOM ! THERE IT GOES. BUT IT SHOULDN'T STAND IN THE WAY OF THIS FILM. WE'RE WORKING AS A TEAM. WE SHOULD PUT ALL THAT OTHER STUFF ON THE BACK BURNER. OH, YEAH ! WE CAN PUT ALL "DAT" ON THE BACK BURNER ! LET ME GO IN THE KITCHEN AND CHECK ON THE BURNER NOW. SEE-- [ Laughing ] I FIND THAT INSULTING, TED. I FIND THAT INSULTING. I NEVER SAID YOU TALKED LIKE THAT. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE LIKE JONAS SALK... THINK COMEDIANS ARE JERKS. FINE, HE'S WRITING THAT DOWN. I'LL WRITE IT TOO. "I NEVER SAID THAT." GET THAT DOWN ON PAPER. GET A PERMANENT RECORD OF THAT. DATE THIS. NOW IT'S ALL PERMANENT. THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID ! YOU SAID THIS WOULD BE MY SCENE. - LISA, WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME. I'M SORRY. - ALBERT ! I'VE GOTTA GO. LARRY, IN HERE. LET'S GO. SHE'S ONLY GETTING CONFIRMED ONCE. HONEY, IT'S AN EMERGENCY. [ Brooks ] GOOD LUCK ! WAIT FOR THE GUY. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, HE'S IN. LET'S GO. BYE, BYE. IT'S REALLY NOT NICE TO BREAK A PROMISE. WAIT A SECOND. HONESTLY, THIS IS SUNDAY. I DON'T HAVE TWO CREWS. BUT MY DRESS ! I'M FILMING YOUR DRESS. GET A GOOD SHOT OF HER DRESS. THIS ISN'T FAIR. IF YOU HAVE TIME, WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED COME BY THE CHURCH. [ Warren ] WE WILL ! BYE, BYE. YOU LIAR ! BYE. [ Warren ] BYE, BYE. I FEEL BAD ABOUT LETTING HER DOWN. DON'T WORRY. SHE'S FINE. YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION. IF YOU PULL OVER FOR A SECOND-- I CAN GET ANOTHER CREW. I'LL MAKE A CALL. YOU DID THE BEST YOU COULD, REALLY. YOU HAVEN'T HAD AN EMERGENCY SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE. I HAVEN'T HAD AN EMERGENCY IN SIX MONTHS. REALLY ? THIS IS EXCITING. YES, IT IS. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING. EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL. [ Brooks Narrating ] APPARENTLY, A BEAUTIFUL OLD SHOW HORSE HAD A HEART ATTACK... IN THE MIDDLE OF A PARADE IN DOWNTOWN PHOENIX. WITHOUT AN IMMEDIATE AND DELICATE BYPASS OPERATION, THE HORSE WOULDN'T MAKE IT. ALTHOUGH YEAGER HAD PERFORMED THIS KIND OF SURGERY ONLY ONCE BEFORE, HE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE, AND PUT THE HORSE'S OWNER AT EASE. [ Motor Whirring ] AT 11:30, PREPARATION FOR SURGERY BEGAN. TAKE IT UP. [ Whirring Continues ] OKAY. [ Murmuring ] [ Whirring Continues ] [ Whirring Stops ] [ Brooks Narrating ] THINGS PROCEEDED SMOOTHLY. AT 11:38 THE HORSE WAS HOOKED UP TO THE ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATOR. [ Breathing Sound ] [ Ticking ] THE TIME WAS DRAWING NEAR. AT 11:41... YEAGER AND HIS ASSISTANTS HAD FINISHED THEIR PREPARATION. WE WERE READY. YOU COULD FEEL THE EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR AS YEAGER ORDERED... THE FINAL DOSAGE OF ANESTHETIC. OKAY, LET'S GIVE HIM TWO AND A HALF PERCENT HALOTHANE... AND THEN GIVE ME CAPILLARY REFILL TIME PLEASE. [ Breathing Sound Continues ] [ Hissing ] [ Nurse ] TWO AND A HALF PERCENT. UH, REFILL TIME: ONE SECOND. GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. OKAY. LET'S GO OVER OUR FINAL CHECKLIST, AND WE'RE READY. RESPIRATION ? SIX. GOOD. LET ME SEE. BLOOD PRESSURE ? WHAT WAS THE BLOOD PRESSURE EARLIER ? ONE-TEN OVER 60. WHAT DO WE HAVE NOW ? ONE HUNDRED OVER 52. THAT'S PERFECT. OKAY, LET ME SEE. UH-- CHECK PUPIL DILATION. GOOD. OKAY. COLOR'S GOOD. LET'S CHECK HIS PULSE. OKAY. THIS IS DRESSED PROPERLY. PULSE IS 44. GOOD. E.K.G. ? NORMAL. OKAY. UH, LET'S GIVE HIM THE ANESTHETIC, AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY. TWO AND A HALF PERCENT HALOTHANE. YOU WANT ANOTHER TWO AND A HALF PERCENT ? DR. YEAGER ? WHAT ? TWO AND A HALF PERCENT ? YES. [ Hissing ] DR. YEAGER, THAT'S FIVE PERCENT HALOTHANE. FIVE ? NO, NO, NO. I SAID TWO AND A HALF PERCENT. I HEARD YOU ORDER IT TWICE. OH, NO. OH, NO. - I COULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. TWO AND A HALF PERCENT. - YOU SAID IT TWICE. NO, THAT'S TOO MUCH. THAT'S TOO MUCH. [ Male Assistant ] YOU ORDERED IT. I DID ? ARE YOU SURE ? YES, I'M SURE. WE GOT IT ON THE FILM. OH, MY GOD ! [ Distorted Ticking ] WAIT ! DON'T PANIC. DON'T PANIC. DO SOMETHING. [ Quickened Respiration, Deflation ] [ Respiration, Deflation Stop ] WE HAVE NO PULSE. TWO AND A HALF AND TWO AND A HALF MAKES FIVE. [ Brooks Narrating ] THE OPERATION WAS OVER AT 11:45, WELL AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. OH, NO. DR. YEAGER TOOK A SHORT BREAK, AND THEN ASKED IF HE COULD SEE ME ALONE IN HIS OFFICE. OF COURSE I OBLIGED. QUITE AN ORDEAL, HUH ? YES, IT WAS. ALBERT, I KNOW WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT, AND PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE ASKING YOU THIS. BUT I'D BE RATHER EMBARRASSED IF WHAT JUST WENT ON IN THERE... WERE INCLUDED IN THIS MOVIE. IT'S NOT GONNA DO ME ANY GOOD AT ALL PERSONALLY. PEOPLE IN PHOENIX ARE GONNA SEE THIS MOVIE. I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, BUT I THINK IT SHOWED YOU IN A VERY GOOD LIGHT. IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK HERE AFTER THIS FILM COMES OUT. I DON'T KNOW IF I OWNED AN ANIMAL AND I SAW ME LOSING THAT HORSE, WHETHER I WOULD TRUST ME. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING ? YEAH, BUT I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. YOU SEE, PEOPLE GO TO DOCTORS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, AND YOU GAVE OFF SOMETHING VERY GOOD IN THERE. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD. YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW. YOU MADE A MISTAKE. EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES. I DON'T KNOW PEOPLE ARE ALL THAT UNDERSTANDING WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR OWN PETS. I THINK THEY ARE. I'VE HAD PEOPLE COME TO ME... BECAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE BOTCHED UP A BROKEN LEG ON A DOG, FOR EXAMPLE, AND IT-- NO, I THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY UNDERSTANDING. THEY'VE BEEN VERY BITTER ABOUT WHOMEVER THEY'VE BEEN TO BEFORE. THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE ADVERTISING A PERSON LIKE ME COULD HAVE. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ? WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT NOW. IT'S ON MY MIND NOW. FORGET IT NOW. AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED NOW, IT'S OUT. YOU COULDN'T JUST SIGN SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT, COULD YOU ? MMM, NO. I MEAN, I COULD, BUT THEN IT'S GONNA BE ON MY MIND. [ Knocks ] HELLO ? NO ONE'S IN HERE. [ Dog Barking ] DR. YEAGER ? [ Barking ] WHAT THE HELL'S GOIN' ON HERE ? [ Barking ] HELLO ? ANYBODY HOME ? COULD YOU AT LEAST GIVE ME SOME KIND OF ASSURANCE... THAT THIS WON'T BE THE ONLY TIME IN THE MOVIE YOU'LL SEE ME WORKING ? CAN YOU SHOW ME SAVING ALL THOSE CATS AND DOGS ? COME ON, WILL YA ? REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING: "TO ERR IS HUMAN; TO FILM DIVINE." NO, IT WAS VERY GOOD. [ Knocking ] WHAT HAPPENED ? WE LOST HER. YOU LOST HER ? I'M SORRY. HOW COULD YOU LOSE HER ? I'M REALLY SORRY. DON'T YOU HAVE PEOPLE HERE WHO STAY WITH THE ANIMALS ? LET'S GET THE DAMN HELL OUT OF HERE AND FIND HER. [ Brooks Narrating ] THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF WHAT WAS TO BE A BAD TIME... IN THE YEAGERS' LIVES. ON WEDNESDAY MRS. YEAGER WAS INFORMED... THAT HER GRANDMOTHER PASSED AWAY FROM THE STROKE. THE FUNERAL TOOK PLACE TWO DAYS LATER, AND WE WERE GRACIOUSLY ALLOWED TO FILM IT. THROUGH JESUS CHRIST, OUR LORD. AMEN. "JESUS SAID, 'I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE. 'HE THAT BELIEVETH IN ME, THOUGH HE WERE DEAD--'" I HATE TO KEEP HARPING ON THIS, BUT I CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON MY WORK ANYMORE. I'VE NEVER KILLED AN ANIMAL THAT SIZE. THIS ISN'T THE PLACE. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER. HONEY, THIS IS THE PLACE. I'M UPSET, YOU'RE UPSET. - WHAT IF HE USES THAT SCENE ? - [ Clears Throat ] COULD YOU STOP TALKING ABOUT THAT MOVIE FOR ONE MINUTE ? WHAT'S THE MATTER ? WHAT'S THE MATTER ? LOOK UP THERE. THAT'S MY GRANDMOTHER. I REALIZE THAT, BUT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WHEN THE KIDS GO TO SCHOOL... AND THEIR FRIENDS SAY, "HEY, DID YOUR DAD REALLY KILL THAT HORSE" ? WHAT ARE THE KIDS GONNA SAY ? WHAT ARE THE KIDS GONNA TELL THEIR FRIENDS ? IF I COULD HAVE YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION. - I'M SURE YOU'LL FEEL BETTER AFTER THIS IS OVER. - [ Mouthing Response ] LET US PRAY. ALMIGHTY GOD-- [ Brooks Narrating ] THINGS GOT WORSE. THE FOLLOWING WEEK WAS... ONE OF THE MOST DEPRESSING PERIODS I HAD EXPERIENCED SINCE EARLY CHILDHOOD. THE ENTIRE FAMILY WAS NOW GRIEF STRICKEN. SHE WITH HER GRANDMOTHER, HE WITH THE GRANDMOTHER AND THE ANIMAL. DAY AFTER DAY WAS THE SAME. LIFELESS. DR. YEAGER WOULD SLEEP SOMETIMES FOR 18 HOURS STRAIGHT. AS A FILMMAKER I WAS FRUSTRATED. I WANTED TO HELP. [ Radio News, Indistinct ] DR. YEAGER ? [ Radio Newsman ] AN EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS BY NAVAJO CHILDREN... WILL BE ON DISPLAY THROUGHOUT THE MONTH. DR. YEAGER ? [ Phone Ringing ] HELLO ? JEANETTE ? IT'S ALBERT. HI. WELL, I KNOW THAT YOU TWO... HAVE BEEN VERY DEPRESSED, AND, UH-- WELL, I'VE BEEN AVOIDING YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE AWARE OF IT, BUT I HAVE FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS... 'CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK WE SHOULD BE GETTING INVOLVED. AND NOW I'M BEGINNING TO THINK... THAT IF I CAN HELP YOU, MAYBE YOU CAN HELP EVERYBODY ELSE. SO, UH-- WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY ? YOU WANNA HAVE DINNER WITH ME ? A SNACK ? YOU WANNA-- DINNER ? WELL, I MEAN, LOOK. I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT SCENE WE HAD AT THE SHOPPING CENTER. IT WAS A GOOD SCENE. IT WAS NICE ACTION. AND WE TALKED. THAT'S MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IS DOING RIGHT NOW, SO-- I MEAN, MAYBE-- I DON'T KNOW. COME ON OVER. ALBERT, I FEEL BADLY ABOUT THAT DAY. I'M STILL A LITTLE EMBARRASSED ABOUT THAT. - I THINK THAT WHAT YOU SAID THERE WAS RIGHT. - WHAT DID I SAY ? YOU SAID ABOUT YOU NOT BEING ANY BETTER THAN WHAT I ALREADY HAVE. - I SAID THAT ? - I THINK YOU WERE RIGHT. COME ON, GET SERIOUS. I HAVE TO MAKE THIS WORK OR I'M NOT GONNA HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR MYSELF. - YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ? - I SEE. OKAY. AW, ALBERT, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. IT'S BETWEEN WARREN AND ME. YOU HATE ME THEN, NOW, RIGHT ? NO, NO. [ Chuckles ] I THINK YOU'RE VERY NICE. NICE. OKAY. YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. JUST TALK, THOUGH. WORK IT OUT WITH LANGUAGE. IT HELPS. I'M NOT D.W. GRIFFITH. I'M GONNA GET IN BIG TROUBLE IF THERE'S NO DIALOGUE. WE WILL. OKAY. PROMISE ? IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER. GREAT. [ Brooks Narrating ] IT DIDN'T. THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY, JEANETTE INVITED SOME FRIENDS OVER... FOR A BARBECUE. SHE SET THE TABLE, HE SET THE MOOD. I COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. I HAD DECIDED THAT WAS IT ! THESE PEOPLE HAD BEEN DEPRESSED... LONG ENOUGH. [ Doorbell Ringing] [ Brooks ] HELLO ? [ Knocking ] ♪ OOH, IT'S A LOVELY DAY TODAY ♪ ♪ IT'S A CHEERY KIND OF DAY ♪ WHERE ARE THE KIDS ? WHAT'RE YOU DOIN' ? ♪ OH, LET'S PLAY ALL THE DAY ♪ WHERE ARE THE KIDS ? THEY WENT TO SCHOOL. LISA HAD A TEST. ♪ OH, LISA HAD A TEST ♪ WHERE'S ERIC ? WENT WITH LISA. OOH. WELL, LOOK, THIS WAS JUST A VERY SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO CHEER EVERYBODY UP. BUT I NEEDED THE KIDS. IT WAS REALLY FOR THEM. I'LL COME BACK WHEN THEY'RE HOME. ALBERT, PLEASE COME IN. WE'RE JUST TALKING HERE. PLEASE COME IN. BUT I DID THIS-- I'LL COME BACK WHEN THE KIDS ARE HOME. I UNDERSTAND. PLEASE COME IN. NO, COME ON. I GOTTA SHOWER. LET ME SHOWER. ALBERT, PLEASE. OKAY, WE'LL COME IN. OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. HI. - HI. - NO, I GOTTA GO HOME. COME ON. PLEASE. I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT. PLEASE. JUST SIT DOWN FOR A MOMENT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, OKAY. OKAY. HOW ARE YOU ? YOU WANT A CUP OF COFFEE ? NO, NO. HI. WELL, I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT... WE'RE UPSET. WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME ? THAT'S WHY I RENTED THIS WHOLE OUTFIT. "YOU DIDN'T RENT ME." BUNNY, WE'RE TALKING SERIOUSLY NOW. ALBERT, WAIT. [ Warren ] NOW, I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT IT, BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M HAVING A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. OH, NO ! DON'T ACT LIKE THAT. COME ON. THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS JUST TO RELAX. SEE, WHEN YOU FEEL THIS WAY, YOU CLAM UP. THAT'S NO GOOD. [ Crunching Sound ] I UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF DEATHS. SO WHAT ? LOOK. I HAVEN'T GOTTEN USED TO THIS WHOLE PROCESS MYSELF. [ Crunching Sound ] I CRIED THE OTHER NIGHT. ABOUT WHAT ? I DON'T REMEMBER. SEE ? I'M MIXED UP TOO. I JUST DON'T CLAM UP. [ Crunching Sound ] LOOK. THERE'S A BIG MEETING COMING UP AT THE END OF THIS MONTH. YOU KNOW, WITH THE INSTITUTE AND THE PEOPLE FROM THE STUDIO. THE ONE WE'RE NOT INVITED TO ? "I CAN'T GO EITHER." THAT'S RIGHT, HE CAN'T. WHY DON'T I SEE IF I CAN CALL IT EARLIER ? MAYBE TOMORROW OR WEDNESDAY IF THEY CAN GET DOWN HERE. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO TELL YOU, BUT THESE PEOPLE DO. THEY'RE SCIENTISTS. THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS. IF YOU'D LISTEN TO ME, THOUGH, I THINK YOU'D FEEL BETTER. JUST GET IT OUT. DON'T INTERNALIZE. TALK TO ANYBODY, A NEIGHBOR. TALK TO AN ANIMAL. REALLY, WARREN. TRUST ME. [ Indistinct ] [ Brooks Narrating ] WE CALLED THE MEETING FOR WEDNESDAY. THESE MONTHLY FEEDBACK AND INPUT SESSIONS WERE CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT. FOR THE INSTITUTE, THIS WAS THE TIME TO PROVIDE ANALYSIS AND GUIDANCE, BASED ON THE FOOTAGE THEY WERE VIEWING. FOR THE STUDIO, THIS WAS THE TIME TO DISCUSS FINANCIAL MATTERS, PERSONNEL PROBLEMS, AND OTHER CINEMATIC DETAILS. THIS WAS DR. JEREMY NOLAND, PROJECT COORDINATOR FOR THE INSTITUTE, AN AMBITIOUS MAN. DR. ANN KRAMER, A GOOD PSYCHOLOGIST, GENERALLY A NICE PERSON. I THINK SHE LIKED ME. DR. HILL WAS THERE, DR. CLEARY, AND MARTIN BRAND, THE STUDIO EXECUTIVE IN CHARGE OF THIS PICTURE. BRAND TOOK THIS PROJECT OVER FROM A YOUNGER MAN WHO WAS FIRED. MARTIN WAS USED TO THE OLD HOLLYWOOD... WITH ITS BIG STARS AND LAVISH SETS. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING HERE. I GUESS THAT'S WHY HE FELT IT WAS UNNECESSARY TO ACTUALLY COME TO PHOENIX. SO, WE'VE TAKEN VOICEPRINTS FROM DAY 12 TO DAY 18, COMPARED THEM AGAINST THE PRINTS OF THESE SAME PEOPLE FROM THE FIRST WEEK OF THE PROJECT, AND NO MATTER WHICH WAY WE COMPUTED THEM, THEY CAME OUT THE SAME. NOW, THESE PEOPLE ARE DEFINITELY OPERATING DIFFERENTLY NOW THAN WHEN FILMING STARTED. THERE ARE CHANGES IN ALL FOUR VOICEPRINT PATTERNS, AND THE EXTENT OF THESE CHANGES IS CONFIRMED BY CHANGES IN BODY TEMPERATURE, AS REVEALED BY THE INFRARED ANALYSIS OF THE FILM. NOW, EACH OF US MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT EXPLANATION FOR WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, BUT IT'S UNDENIABLE THAT YOU'VE STRONGLY ALTERED THE REALITY YOU'RE FILMING. IN MY OPINION, YOU'RE GETTING A FALSE REALITY HERE, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOUT IT. ME ? WAIT A SECOND. I-I'D LIKE TO GET BACK TO SOMETHING ANN SAID A LITTLE EARLIER. YOU SAID YOU THINK I LOOK HEAVIER NOW THAN WHEN THE FILMING STARTED. WHERE WOULD THAT BE ? IN THE CHEEKS ? NO, NO. I SAID THAT IN SOME OF THE LATER FOOTAGE, YOU LOOK SOMEWHAT FATIGUED. OH, I SEE. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. NOT FAT, FATIGUED. I'VE BEEN UP A LOT. FATIGUED IS OKAY, BUT HEAVY'S ANOTHER THING. 'CAUSE I EAT RAW VEGETABLES. THERE'S NO REASON I SHOULD-- MR. BROOKS. YES ? OKAY. YOU LOOK FINE. NOW I'D LIKE, IF WE COULD, TO GO TO DAY FOUR. I BELIEVE THAT'S, UH, SCENE 31. [ Sighs ] NOW HERE'S SOME FOOTAGE I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU. LIGHTS. WHAT ? WHAT DID YOU SAY ? LIGHTS. OH, NO. SEE, THIS IS MY HOME. IT'S NOT A PROJECTION ROOM. IF YOU'D SAY, "WOULD YOU LIKE TO TURN THE LIGHTS OFF ?" I'D SAY, "SURE." "LIGHTS," HE SAYS. MAN LIVES IN THE KITCHEN ? UH-- NOW, WE'VE BLOWN UP WHAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU, AND I'M GONNA KEEP REPEATING IT, BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO CATCH THE FIRST TIME. IN FACT, THE COMPUTER DIDN'T CATCH IT TILL THE SECOND RUN. [ Noland ] WHEN WE STARTED FILMING WARREN YEAGER, HE WAS DRINKING COFFEE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND ONLY, NO ASSISTANCE AT ALL FROM HIS LEFT HAND-- AS DISTINCTIVE A TRAIT AS HANDWRITING. NOW WATCH AGAIN. RIGHT HAND ONLY. THAT'S IT. NOW, ON DAY 13, HE STARTS DRINKING COFFEE WITH BOTH HIS HANDS. NOW WATCH THE DECISION. THERE ! NOW WATCH AGAIN. [ Brooks ] WHAT ? [ Noland ] WATCH THE DECISION. THERE ! SEE ? HE'S MUCH LESS RELYING ON HIS ENTIRE RIGHT SIDE. [ Brooks ] OH, COME ON ! [ Kramer ] YES, IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT WITHIN TWO MONTHS... HE WILL HAVE SHIFTED THE CUP ENTIRELY TO HIS LEFT HAND, AND HIS RIGHT HAND WILL REMAIN UNUSED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE GESTURE. [ Noland ] MM-HMM. TOTAL CHANGE IN BODY LANGUAGE. LIGHTS. VERY INTERESTING. I HADN'T NOTICED IT AT ALL. WELL, WAIT A MINUTE. I MEAN, THIS CUP COULD'VE BEEN HOT. NOPE. THE INFRARED ANALYSIS OF THE FILM... SHOWS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE OF THE DISH. [ Brand ] ALBERT, MAY I INTERRUPT FOR ONE MINUTE, PLEASE ? PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA WALK OUT OF A THEATER SAYING, "I DON'T LIKE THAT GUY, THE GUY WHO HOLDS THE CUP WITH ONE HAND, WITH TWO HANDS." ABSOLUTELY. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THEY DO HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF SAYING. "WHERE THE HELL IS PAUL NEWMAN ? WHERE'S REDFORD ? WHERE'S NICHOLSON ?" JESUS. BELIEVE ME, THEY PREFER NICHOLSON WITH THE CUP... THAN THE CUP WITH THE OTHER GUY. ALBERT, SO YOU KEEP YEAGER IN, BUT YOU GOTTA GET SOMEBODY IN THE MOVIE, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. YOU MAYBE OUGHTA ADD A NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR, OR A BOSS, OR A CLEANING LADY, SOMEBODY WITH A NAME, SOMEBODY WHO'D DRAW SOME PEOPLE. YOU'VE GOT ROCK FRIENDS. WOULD IT BE SO BAD TO HAVE NEIL DIAMOND SITTING IN A MEETING LIKE THIS ? SCHMUCK ! YOU'LL MAKE A HELL OF A LOT MOREMONEY WITH NEIL DIAMOND IN THERE THAN WITH THE GUY WITH THE CUP ! COULD WE GET BACK ON THE TRACK ? I NEED SOMEONE TO GET THAT CUP FOR ME. STOP WITH THE CUP ! REALLY, I CAN'T HEAR THIS ANYMORE. I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. EXPLAIN TO ME IN ENGLISH, PLEASE. ALL RIGHT. QUITE SIMPLY, THE FILMING HAS TRIGGERED A DRASTIC EMOTIONAL CHANGE IN THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT, AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT. AND THAT'S BAD ? I DON'T LIVE IN A WORLD OF GOOD AND BAD. I DON'T TALK THAT LANGUAGE. I THINK WE'RE BUILDING A LOT OF CONCLUSIONS ON A LITTLE BIT OF EVIDENCE. MAYBE WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH IS GROWTH. MAYBE IT'S INEVITABLE. AND HEALTHY. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. HOWARD'S RIGHT. EXCUSE ME. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM DR. CLEARY. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT I THINK ? YES, PLEASE. OKAY. ONE, WE GET OUT OF THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES. WE MUST GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE. - OH, WAIT A MINUTE. - I'M NOT THROUGH. WE GO AWAY AT NIGHT. WE FILM ONLY WHEN SCHEDULED. WE GIVE THEM SOME PRIVACY AND STABILITY... SO THAT WHEN THEY WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, THEY DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE ON A MOVIE SET ! A MOVIE SET. MARTIN, TELL HIM HOW DIFFERENT THIS IS FROM A MOVIE SET. ON A MOVIE SET, YOU GOT ACTORS THAT ARE WELL-KNOWN. IF THEY GIVE YOU TROUBLE, YOU CALL THEIR AGENTS AND YOU PUT SOME HEAT UNDER THEIR ASS. THANKS. LOOK, TED, THERE'S NO REASON TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE. I SPENT A LOT IN PURCHASING IT, AND A LOT IN DECORATING IT. IT'S UNNECESSARY. IT IS VERY NECESSARY. IT'S NOT NECESSARY. YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET WALLPAPER ? HOW DIFFICULT IS IT ? IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ! THIS IS PHOENIX ! WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES, AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR DAMN WALLPAPER ! YOU KNOW YOU SPEND 80% OF YOUR LIFE LOOKING AT WALLS ? GENTLEMEN, PLEASE. [ Arguing ] I WENT TO L.A. FOR THAT WALLPAPER ! -THE REASON-- - WAIT A MINUTE. MAY I-- MAY I MAKE A SUGGESTION THAT MIGHT BREAK THIS LOGJAM ? WHO INVITED YOU IN THE BEDROOM ? MR. BROOKS, PLEASE ? WHAT ? THE INSTITUTE HAS A CENTER UP IN THE FOOTHILLS... THAT'S USED FOR ENCOUNTER AND THERAPY SESSIONS, MAINLY FOR OUR EXECUTIVES AND CLIENTS. BUT I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER TAKING THE YEAGERS UP THERE FOR A WEEKEND. I THINK THEY'LL OPEN UP AGAIN. OH, YES. YOU MEAN LIKE ECHELON ? LIKE HOT TUBS ? NATURE TRAILS, MASSAGE. ABSOLUTELY ! SEE ? THAT'S SOMETHIN' I CAN USE ! GREAT. THANK YOU. ARE YOU CRAZY ? YOU WANNA FLY ALL THESE PEOPLE TO COLORADO ? - WHAT ? - WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUT 'EM ALL ON DRUGS ? GIVE THEM PSYCHIATRISTS. ENROLL THEM ALL IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS WHILE YOU'RE AT IT. [ Brand ] JUST A MINUTE ! WE GOT A BUDGET ! REMEMBER THE COSTS, DR. CLEARSON. PLEASE REMEMBER THE COSTS. OH, YEAH. COSTS. YOU SPEND A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS ON RESEARCH. I DON'T THINK YOU'VE SPENT A DIME FINDING A QUALIFIED PERSON TO HEAD THIS PROJECT. YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE AT THE CONTROLS OF A 747... WHO'S NEVER EVEN FLOWN AS A PASSENGER. THAT WAS AIRPORT '76. TED, I THINK I'VE LOGGED MORE MILES... THAN YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE UNIVERSITY PUT TOGETHER. - YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT. - I'M NOT MISSING THE POINT. I'M A MILLION-MILER. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS ? I'LL SHOW YOU MY PIN. I CAN GET INTO ANY V.I.P. LOUNGE IN THIS COUNTRY, TED. I KNOCK ON THE DOOR, I TELL 'EM MY NAME, GIVE 'EM THE PIN NUMBER, SIT IN THE LOUNGE. I CAN DRINK COFFEE AND EAT THEIRDOUGHNUTS, AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE FLYING ANYWHERE. HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW WHO CAN DO THAT, HUH ?

THE BOOK WAS CALLED NIGHTMARE IN THE DESERT. ITS AUTHOR, DR. THEODORE CLEARY. APPARENTLY, CLEARY TOOK HIS NOTES FROM THE JOURNAL... AND DECIDED TO MAKE THE FAST BUCK. STRINGING TOGETHER A BUNCH OF FAMILIAR CATCHPHRASES... LIKE "MIND CONTROL" AND "PSYCHOLOGICAL RAPE," HE WROTE ONE OF THOSE QUICKIE BOOKS, THE KIND YOU PEDDLE TO THE PUBLISHERS WHO MISSED OUT ON WATERGATE.

HOWEVER, OFF THEIR PROPERTY THEY WERE FAIR GAME. IT STARTED ON MONDAY AFTERNOON. WHILE COMING HOME FROM LUNCH, DR. AND MRS. YEAGER ENCOUNTERED A "LIVE EYE" TRUCK. I DON'T WANNA TALK TO YOU.

AS YOU KNOW, ALBERT, SOME MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTE-- [ Brooks ] AN EMERGENCY MEETING WAS CALLED FOR 6:00 P.M. ON SATURDAY THE 25th. IT WAS REQUESTED BY THE HEAD OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR, DR. ISAAC STEVEN HAYWARD. ...ENTIRELY A NEW FIELD, THE PSYCHOLOGICAL-- AND APPROVED BY MARTIN BRAND, WHO CONSIDERED THIS MEETING IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO CALL FROM CATALINA, INTERRUPTING THE FIRST VACATION HE'D HAD IN OVER A WEEK. ALBERT, WE'RE KNOWN IN EUROPE-- AS I SAT ACROSS THE TABLE FROM THIS MAN, I WAS SLOWLY LOSING MY RESPECT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. ALSO, HE WORE FAR TOO MUCH COLOGNE. WHEN YOU HAVE A REPUTATION IN AS DIFFICULT A FIELD AS THIS, YOU'VE GOT TO MAINTAIN IT. AND YOU THINK SOMETHING'S GOING ON HERE... THAT'S PREVENTING YOU FROM MAINTAINING YOUR REPUTATION ? I HAVE NO OPINION. PFFT ! BUT WE'VE DONE A GREAT MANY TESTS IN THE LAST FIVE DAYS-- EVERYTHING FROM PUBLIC OPINION SURVEYS TO URINALYSES OF OUR OWN STAFF. FINE. WHAT DO THE TESTS TELL YOU ? THEY INDICATE TO US THAT OUR EFFORTS HERE... HAVE COME TO THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE. ANYTHING BEYOND THIS POINT WOULD BE SEVERELY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. I SEE. NOW IT'S BECOMING CLEAR. THE INSTITUTE GETS A LITTLE HEAT, AND BOOM ! THEY NOT ONLY LEAVE THE KITCHEN, THEY TAKE THE WHOLE KITCHEN WITH THEM ! LET'S CONSIDER THE FAMILY FOR A MOMENT. OH, WHAT'D YOU DO ? RUN URINE TESTS ON THEM TOO ? WE DID A SERIES ON THEM, YES. THANKS, HOWIE. HOPE YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR LITTLE HANDS WET. [ Brand ] COME ON ! JESUS CHRIST ! LOOK. THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY CLOSE TO COMPLETE PERSONALITY DISINTEGRATION. OH, DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH. I DON'T REMEMBER A TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN I HAVEN'T BEEN CLOSE TO PERSONALITY DISINTEGRATION. AND HOW THE HELL WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE FEELING, ANYWAY ? FROM YOUR MICKEY MOUSE TESTS ? DON'T BLAME THE TESTS FOR WHAT THEY TELL US. OH, I DON'T BLAME 'EM. THEY'RE GREAT. WHY DON'T WE DO MORE, HUH ? I BET YOU'D LIKE IT, WOULDN'T YOU, NOLAND ? WANNA GET THAT CUP AGAIN ? I'LL GET YOU LOTS OF CUPS. MAYBE A HUNDRED CUPS ! I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT YOU PEOPLE. YOU'RE GREAT WITH CUPS, BUT WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE ARE BALLS ! I THINK IF YOU ASK ANY MAGICIAN, HE'LL TELL YOU THAT CUPS WITHOUT BALLS DOESN'T MEAN JACK SHIT ! [ Brand ] ALBERT, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? LOOK, LET'S NOT ARGUE. SAY THE FAMILY'S FINE. SAY THE FAMILY'S PERFECT. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU FOR A MINUTE. LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE. YOU FAILED, THAT'S WHAT YOU DID. YOU SCHMUCK, YOU FAILED. YOU STARTED OUT WITH THIS ARTSY-CRAFTSY REALITY CRAP, AND WHAT DID YOU END UP WITH ? THE NEWS ! THE GODDAMN NEWS ! PEOPLE GET THAT FOR FREE. YOU THINK SOMEBODY'S GONNA HIRE A BABY-SITTER, TAKE A TAXICAB, GO ALL THE WAY THE HELL DOWNTOWN, GO UP TO THE BOX OFFICE, SHELL OUT FOUR BUCKS... AND SAY, "HERE ! HERE ! HERE'S MY FOUR DOLLARS ! WHAT TIME DOES THE NEWS GO ON" ? "HERE. HERE'S MY FOUR DOLLARS." IS MONEY YOUR ENTIRE LIFE, MARTIN ? MONEY ! MONEY ! LET'S TALK ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS FOR A MINUTE ! ACROSS THE STREET ARE FOUR PEOPLE. THESE PEOPLE HAD A DREAM. THEY TOOK ON A PROJECT. IT WAS NEW, IT WAS EXCITING, AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO A WHOLE YEAR, NOT TWO MONTHS ! NOW, I'M IN SHOW BUSINESS. I'M USED TO MY COMMITMENTS BEING DUMPED ON. BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE ORDINARY PEOPLE WITH ORDINARY FEELINGS. DO YOU WANNA GO ACROSS THE STREET AND TELL THEM ? NO ! YOU WON'T EVEN COME DOWN HERE ! DO YOU WANNA TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY ? NO ! JUST A MINUTE. I THINK THEY KNOW MORE THAN YOU GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR. [ Doorbell ] OH, LOOK WHO'S TALKING. THE PEE HOARDER. [ Doorbell ] SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE DOOR. WHY ? WHY NOT TAKE A URINALYSIS OF IT ? THEN WE'LL KNOW WHO IT IS WITHOUT GOING THERE. ISN'T THAT A GREAT IDEA ? COME ON, NOLAND ! MORE DATA ! MORE DATA ! WE NEED MORE DATA. COME ON, DR. CUP ! MORE DATA ! MORE DATA, HUH ? GET SOME DATA FOR ME ! MORE DATA ! MORE DATA ! MORE DATA ! WE NEED MORE, MORE. HI. WHAT A BREATH OF FRESH AIR. PLEASE, COME IN. HERE ARE YOUR TESTS, YOUR LIVING TESTS. DR. AND MRS. YEAGER, I'M IN THE COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS, AND IT'S MY JOB TO GET THROUGH TO THESE PEOPLE, BUT I DON'T THINK I'M DOING VERY GOOD AT IT. I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE WORD "COMMITMENT," THE WORD "DEDICATION." MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT TO THEM. - WE WANNA STOP. - WHAT ? THIS IS OVER. NO. LOOK, I DON'T WANNA GET INTO ANY MORE OF YOUR INTELLECTUAL ARGUMENTS. THIS IS RUINING OUR LIVES. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE BARGAINED FOR. THERE WAS NO BARGAINING. YOU APPLIED, WE ACCEPTED. ALBERT, THE CHILDREN ARE AFRAID TO GO TO SCHOOL. THAT'S NORMAL, TRUST ME. LOOK, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK IS NORMAL. WE NO LONGER WANNA BE INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT. THAT'S FINAL. THAT'S IT. THIS WAS THE WHOLE FAMILY'S DECISION. OH, I'LL BET IT WAS. I'M SURE LITTLE ERIC GOT A FULL VOTE, HUH ? WE'RE NOT GONNA DISCUSS THIS. OKAY, NO DISCUSSION. JUST A FEW FACTS AND LOOSE ENDS, HUH ? $25,000. THAT'S MORE THAN HALF YOUR MONEY WAS DUE ON THE COMPLETION OF THIS PICTURE. I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE END, AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO WITHOUT THE BOAT... AND THE TRAILER YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS, AND LISA'S BRACES. I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT TEETH. SHE MAY LOOK ALL RIGHT NOW. IN THREE YEARS SHE'LL BE AN ELEPHANT GIRL. THESE COME RIGHT DOWN TO HER WAIST. AND ALSO, IF SOMETHING, GOD FORBID, REALLY BAD HAPPENS, YOU HAVE NO INSURANCE, YOU'RE NOT IN THE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD, YOU HAVE NO COVERAGE, YOU'LL GET NO BENEFITS. STOP IT ! WITH WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH, WE COULD JUST PAY THEM AND FORGET ABOUT IT. OKAY, WE'LL FORGET ABOUT IT. GO AHEAD, TAKE THE MONEY. GO AHEAD. I'M GONNA GET THE FAMILY THAT I WANTED TO CHOOSE ANYWAY. - WHAT WAS THEIR NAME, THE ONE I WANTED ? - THE FELTONS. THE FELTONS, WISCONSIN ! THAT'S THE HEART OF THIS COUNTRY. HERE'S WHAT I SAY. WE ALL TAKE A WEEK OFF. I'LL GET A HIGH COLONIC. THEN WE'LL COME BACK WITH A NEW FAMILY, A BIGGER INSTITUTE-- [ Brand ] AND ANOTHER STUDIO ! WE'RE NOT SPENDING ANOTHER DIME ON THIS PICTURE !
