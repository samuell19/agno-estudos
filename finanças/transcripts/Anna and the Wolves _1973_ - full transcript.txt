All cover! Are you okay? Don't want anything? - It's not the first time. - She have nightmares . Good night, sir. Just a second Anna. You will take care, my wife, she wants to decide herself about the girls education. - Yes? - I... I wanted to ask you... If you can. To get the girls off my mothers influence. No problem, but your brother Jose told me if i had a problem with the girls talk to him. Don't listen to my brother. The girls are nice, but very emotive, impressionable. Yes, i noticed. I want you to know... I put all my trust in you. Thank you, i'll do my best good night. - Do you need anything? - No. Do you like your bedroom? We can change you if you don't. I really like the bedroom, i'm very tired, i'm sorry. - Good night. - Good night. - Amparo! Open up! - Just a moment! Take some flowers. Hello Lucio? It's me. I need some stuff, take a note. I want two packs of macaroni... Yes, the usual. Half a sausage... The Food! Our food. Little bird that sings in the pool don't wake up the kid that's in the cradle. Sleep now bright star. To the kids who sleep, god holds them and the mothers that wash up, god bless them. - Good morning. - Good morning. A letter for you. Curious, comes from Japon, Tokio. You seem surprised. Were you specting that letter? - No. - Good morning. ''Anna, i'm in brothel, thinking of you, in your breast, and your thighs, be over you and feel your blood...'' Jesus christ! Hello. - Are you painting the cave? - Yes. Don't you think is better this way? I like it better in white. Of course. More light, cleaner. Yes. - Can i help you? - You're going to get stained. No, not with care. Can i take this one? Yes, as you wish. - Is it true that a ermite lived here? - I like to think so. No, not the bed! What? I'm sorry, i didn't knew. Don't worry, i clean it. I didn't knew. Yes, it's okay. - It slept here? - No, he went on his knees. - A hundred years on his knees. - A hundread years? - That's crazy. - Why? The ermites gave everything up, they only meditate and penance. They purify themselves. Why did they purify themselves? It doesn't matter to lose friends, credit, and the property, It doesn't matter to not have comfort and delight of the world, and lack of every comfort of it. So... They gave up their lifes? The conditions of the lonely birds are five. The first, he goes high. Second, it doesn't suffer company, even if it's like him. Third, it puts the beak on the air. Fourth, doesn't have a colour. Fifth, it sings soft. A hundread year... On their knees. Don't know. Maybe if you get used to it. A hundread year... On their knees. Don't know. Maybe if you get used to it. Juan, the drops!

I was in the cave. - What were you doing there? - Talking to your brother. - Fernando is already in the cave... - Yes, he's painting. - Painting the cave. - Yes, everything white. - Come with me, i want to show you something. Come on in, Anna. Can't deny it, wasn't happy to relying the education of my nieces to a stranger. In your case, a strange with different manners. But now i trust you. You behave perfect. With the girls, as well as other aspect we're going to talk later. To sum up, i want to make you a proposition. - Yes? - Do you like my museum? Collection? Very nice. Anyone comes in with you. Follow me. And why are you collection all this? Somethings belongs to the family assets. I would have liked to be in the army, but you can't always do what you want. Wonderful! - Like it? - Very beautiful! Over here. Look at this cloth. - So soft. - A great uniform. Come here. Little by little i'm filling everything. - Was that a bullet? - Yes, during the last war. Come on. I can't preserve it. I'm doing what i can. Look, naphthalene. Yes. I clean when i can. But i need the hand of a woman. - I need you, Anna. - Me? - I don't know anything about this... - Go down. You're a smart woman, educated, calm. You will understand i can't leave this to the servants. - But, I don't know... - Of course, i'll pay you. And, my protection. Do you agree? - Alright yes. - Perfect. Come with me. Sit down. This one comes from Athens. Why don't you open it? - No, if you don't need anything else... - Sit down. Yes? Read it. I'll read it later. Strange mail. Your stalker is getting closer. Tokio, Hongkong, Bombai, Athens... Curious too, the progression of the obscenities. The last one exceed them all. ''What are you doing? Alone in your bedroom, your bed covered with my letters...'' - Have you been reading my letters? - Obviously. - And copied them. - With what right? With the right that my position gets me. I'm responsable for my family safety. And don't want anyone to, upset the order and peace. What you did, is... Criminal offence. Criminal offence. I'm going to call the police. You don't know who write those letters, i do. My brother Juan. - What? - Sit down. Sit down. Your brother Juan? Yes. I'm in a bad situation, too many responsibilities. But someone's got to make the decitions in here. My mother got sick since my father's death. Fernando's a emedullate and Juan has all the wrong ideas... I'm sorry. - And the stamps? - From the family collection. Aha. Have a drink. You can take them, they are yours. I only ask for your discretion. Deep down you like the letters, no? - Not with the girls father. - Don't fear. I can guarantee personal safety. Juan is harmless, just fiction, obsessions. Agree? Not a word. Specially not to Juan. And you can take the stamps. They worth a lot. - I want to go home. - We have to find her. - So cute. - Didn't they cut her hair? I want to go home! - Over here. - There she is! Dolly... Poor thing!... Dolly... Paris, France... lstambul, Athens, Pa... Paris. Madrid. Anna! - What's this? - Look! What is this? We found her buried. They buried her, poor Dolly. - Poor Dolly. - Dolly? - The wolves did it. - What wolves? The wolves! Carlota, come come. What's the problem? Why are you crying? - Because of Dolly? - Yes. She's fine, just dirty. - They cut her hair! - Well, we'll clean her. Let's put her here. Poor thing, where was she? Help, Help me please. Where was she? Kids kids... - She's dead, can't have childrens. - And the worms ate her from inside. What are you talking about? She's just dirty. She just needs a shower, like you. Look at you all dirty! After her shower, we'll make her a wig. - I can help you. - Alright, now to the shower! Who is it? - Anna. - Just a moment. A moment, a moment... - What do you need? - I need to talk to you. - But... Now? - Yes, Now. - Yes? - It's urgent. I need to talk to you. - Must be important. - Very important. This evening the girls found this, buried and with the hair cut. Aha, that's it. Yes that. Do you think that's normal? No. Disgusting. Very Disgusting. To say the least. - Do you know who did this? - No. Not really. It's important for the girls to not be shocked . I don't understand. This can happen to one of your daughters, how can you be calm. Yes, very calm, it's a doll, my daughters are safe, don't worry. Give it to me. I insist, it's important for them to not be shocked. See? Nothing happened. The doll is lost. No one buried, No one cut her hair. Tomorrow i'll bought another. The girls forget, and nothing happened. Now you think i did it, that i have nothing better to do? Frankly, i don't know. - Why not? - Fine. - If i did? - If you did? If you did, i quit right now. I can't take care of the girls education under this circumstances. Please! Before you do that, think it through. Don't be fool by appearances. I want to know who's the maniac, who did this. There's not any maniac. Sorry if i can't be more explicit. Anna! When are you going to trust me? You're a wonderful woman, young, pretty. Why are you always so defensive? Let yourself go. Leave yourself. Accept some tenderness. Have you ever been told... You have a wonderful neck? I want to know, who tortured the doll. You're stubborn! I trust you'll be discreet. It was my brother. - Don Jose? - Not Jose. Fernando. Yes, my brother Fernando. That's his weakness. Fernando? What a great truth. Where are the plants? Everything is gone. Before the war this was a great garden. And where are my trees, you take advantage of me! Not strawberries! Nothing! - My poor trees! - Don't upset yourself! Mom's dropsy, and they sent her for a walk. God help her. No! - Anna! - No! Leave me! May i come in? The door's open. Will you live here? Why? Because you can't leave the sorrow, agony, toilet, hungry until they are asleep. Yes, I'm going to live here. This is what the hermits did and other saints, that in the deserts... choose the smallest place, like caves, to lock up. That's what the book says. It's beautiful. And your family? Have you thought about them? ''Close your eyes and don't think, listen to the sound, words, noises, but don't try to identify them. If you can't stop thinking, listen the noise of your thoughts.'' The noise of your thoughts... Please, Anna, i need to be alone. You won't find it. You're weak. Please, Anna, leave me. Alright. - Do you need anything? - No. Three identical boxes with the same names. What one needs to do to be conciliatory. This is like searching a needle in a haystack. See? They disrespect me. I know what happened. They took them, thiefs! Mrs, that's not true! Here no one steals. Thief...! - What do you need? - You called me, mrs. Aha. Come. Come here, sit here. - Here? - Yes, with me. You're not family, tell me the truth. They want to trick me. They say Fernando went to the dentist. I know it's a lie. That one! This is the Bethlehem. See? Everything is a mess in this house. If i could move... - The snow? - Yes. I want to see it. The Snow. My sons Bethlehem. Sons, the only worth thing. If my husband hadn't died, i would have had many. You know, i still got milk. - Really? - Yes, still got. - We were talking about something else. - That Fernando went to the dentist. Yes, they lie to me, so i won't have an attack. - Fernando is in the cave, right? - Yes. Here it is. This one says ''Juanito''. That one! Bring it! Here's everything. Sweater... Pacifier... The photos... This isn't Juan box, It's Jose! They rummage everything... The mouses are eating out memories. Jose boots. - That's a girl! - No, silly, it's Jose. My husband wanted a girl, but the lord punished us. But we dressed him like this, had a blonde curly hair. Until what age he had it like that? Until he made his first communion, of course. ''Pepito''. I bet it's Juan. Doesn't look like Juan. The St. Diego tales, yes it's Juan. Look! Shirts, boots... Knickers... He was always naughty. Always chasing his cousins. Cousin Angelica, very upsetting. - Why upset?. - Disgusting things. - Disgusting how? - You can imagine. Can you get me Fernando box? My Fernando, the best one... He acts like he's doesn't like me, but he does. A handcraft... Another knickers... A thimble. - What's this? - A thimble, he used to suck his thumb. We used to put aloe on his thumb, but it didn't worked. Until we gave him that. But he... Had this on his thumb? Yes, had it for almost five months. He hurt, the lips, face, tongue, everything... Poor. And why is Fernando living in the cave? My sons... You have to understand them. Jose seems authoritarian, despotic, inflexible. That's his duty, he protects us. Juan poor Juan. A bad wedding, he deserved better. And Fernando, he's alone. Need company. - Will you see him? - Yes, alright. Wait, it's my turn! Let him, let him. I have a letter for you. - Here. - Thank you. Can you open it? Please. - My hands are... - Yes yes. Thanks. Can you read it to me? - What? - The letter, read it to me. - I don't understand. - I would like you to read it. Nonsense. I can't, it's private. No, it's not private. I would love you to read it. -Would you? Really? - Yes. - Well, if you insist. - I insist. - Now? - Why not? Alright. - It's not signed. - That's weird. ''Anna, you were in your bed, i took the sheets, and you offer me your body, left in your dreams. I slide in...'' - This is outrageous! - Keep reading. ''I slide in, and for a long time kissed your skin. The wrinkle of your back... The dark humidity of your armpit...'' - Wait! - Stop it girls! - Juan! - Coming. Hurry up! - Before the war there were trees. - Yes, mrs. Now there isn't any. There's nothing. The weed is eating what's left. Did you heard the wolves last night? Yes, mrs. The wolves are coming... - Calm down, mrs. - I can't calm down, Amparo! Juan, tell Fernando to come out. Fernando, come out! Come on, son, come! It's me, mom. - What do you want? - Haven't you heard mom? Come here! Open it. Let's go to the cave! Now eat! It's pointless. Leave me alone. - Respect my decisions. - Yes, but eat. Fernando, come here! Come to mom, i can't stand up. Don't make your mother cry. You have to eat. Eat, the food's very good. The appetite when you fulfill it, it's sweet and seems good, then you feel the bitterness. Nonsense, the appetite, needs to be fulfilled. Look, it's very nice! - It's good, try it. - Stop it, mom! Eat! Don't hit your brother! You have to be together! Mom, it's the only way. Fernando, open your mouth. Open! Chew! More! My son! Fernando! The best of all always! You're hot. Has a fever. To bed now! - Get him a glass of milk with honey. - Fernando, eat something. Alright, doesn't want to eat. Don't it, to the cave! The worst is humidity, get's in your boones. - He's always been weak. - Don't worry, mom, he'll come out. - We can only force him. - Go outside! Fernando has always been stubborn. Doesn't worry about you. Stay away from here, understood? Good. Home! The chair! - Let's have lunch, mom. - Yes, son. The food is getting colder. And i hate reheated meat! Isn't that a army song? It's ''lt's a Long Way to Tipperary''. Very good. Do you like army songs? I do. My dad was in the army. Very good. Anna, i would like to understand you. Me? I'm very easy to understand, just a normal person. - Why did you force my brother to read the letter? - What? Why did you force my brother to read the letter? - How do you know? - I know everything that's going on here. - You want him? - Me? Please! - What then? - I wanted to have fun. Maybe, make him less confident. Are you mad? No, confused. Can't fully understand you yet... - Beautiful! - What? - Wonderful! - Yes, it's great. Original, took me years to find it. Model, fast, let's dress him. Take it. - Your collection is getting better. - Yes. Buttom up. - Uniforms transform people. - It's true. - Why don't you try it? - Me? - Why not? - No, different sizes. - Not different! I'm sure it will fit you! - Try it on! - But Anna! - I insist, try it. - But Anna! I insist! - It won't fit. - And you're going to sit in the chair, let me see. It fits. The belt! Well, i don't know how to do this. - Like this. - Aha. Be careful. It must be great to wear a uniform. Give orders, powerful... The hat. Get it, Anna. Stand aside! Are you scared? No. Bravo. I think... This deserves a decoration. - Are you making fun of me? - Yes, sir. Bye. Good morning. - How are you? - In peace. - My mother send you? - Yes. - It's useless. - Fernando... You have to eat. Even hermits eat. Understand? You'll get sick if you don't eat. Not any more, i'm not free from any misery. - What are you saying... - You can't understand it. I've left behind all my weaknesses. I've levitated What have you done? Ascent, go up, float between sky and earth. - That's levitate. - Spiritually? No. Ecstasy. Mood state. Suspension of the senses... Physiological reality... One forgets about his body and rises. Weightless. Air of air. How do you did that? Concentration. Resignment. Mortify. And that... anyone can get it? Anyone, who wants it passionate. Then me. Concentration... Resignment... Mortify... I can't, i can't do it. I doesn't feel anything. ''Become a dove, dove in flight height and, light of contemplation And in a burning love, and the simplicity you have, become from that flight height, in which you pretend to own me, that the time hasn't come, with such wisdom, and adapt to this one, that i now impart to you ...'' Fernando... ''Left, without waiting for an answer. The girl soothe her rage. And felt an anguish in her chest. What was happening? Why wasn't she feeling resentment? Dressed, and after saying goodbye, she rushed towards the street. Walked, to the first church, and asked for father Feijoo. Who had always confessed her, and gave great advice . Haven't seen you around in a long time, said the priest. They told me, you want to talk to me.'' Mom... - If he stays forever in the cave? - Don't be absurd, he'll come out. Go on, keep reading, what will she say to the priest. - Should i give it a ...? - Yes. ''I wish you to confess me and give me absolution. The father laughed. You can't sin, you're too pure.'' You don't undertstand. If Fernando gets Anna, i'll lose her, mom. - Can't live without her. - Fight, you have the right to? Fight. How mom? You don't know her, she's not like the others. This one is bad, bad. - Besides, fight with my brother? - You're right. Agree with your brother. Just don't demoralize. Wear the uniform with all the decorations. You'll feel more confident. Then give me the boots, i'll clean them. Keep reading. - ''You don't sin darling...'' - You've read that before. Sorry, mom. ''The girl started talking with soft voice. And when she went into rugged terrain, her voice vibrated more father Feijoo didn't blinked.'' I'm sorry, mom, can't do it. - You think, with the uniform? - I'm sure. Agree with Fernando and Juan, we have to take him into account. - I'm not worried about Juan. - Me neither, poor Luchy. I dream every night, she climbs to the roof, screams and jump. Mom, you do understand me. And your thighs, Anna, get you under the weight of my body. tear your clothes beat your body, feel your blood, and then kiss your body, inch by inch, kiss the groove of your back, kiss the darkness of your armpit, kiss the round... Well, hello there. Anna...! You heard me and came! I've been waiting for you. - Yes? - Yes. Wishing you. Ask me whatever you want. Want money? I'll give it to you. Get out! I don't care about anyone, not my wife, not my daughters, only you. Will you leave Luchy for me? You love me, Anna. You keep my letter, read them. Will you leave Luchy for me? Yes. - Will you do that for me? - I would. Luchy! - No, don't do that, Anna! - Luchy...! No, the smallest. Enjoy your meal. Your brother Jose... All he wants, is for me to put the uniforms. Juan only wants to take me to bed. - Do you want anything from me, Fernando? - You're here willingly, I haven't called you. I don't want anything from you. You want something from me. Me? You want me to help you get it. But without any effort. What have you given up? Nothing! Yes, here you're, but your imagination? The Ayales. They'll help us get what we need. I'm sorry for you. Can't do it better. Nobody taught me to sew. You can't even give that up. Paintings, falseness, vanity... ''In a way that only man has all the offensive weapons, that have been distributed all around the territory, and so he, offends more than all of them together. For you to understand, advices, there was no more than one danger between tigers and lions, That was, to lose that material, and suffered life. But among men, there are many more dangers. Believe me, there isn't a wolve, lion, tiger, basilisk, that can reach man, it exceeds them all in evil.'' - We have to burn everything! - What are you doing? - We have to burn everything! - Fernando, no! This things are mine! I can't burn them, No! Okay, i won't burn it. But with all this is pointless, you'll never make it. You may go. Why are you here, If you can't even leave that. You better go, Anna. Fernando! Alright. No, my hair... No, i wasn't... It's a dream. That's what this is. You're dreaming. A nightmare. You're dreaming. Sleep. Sleep thight. No! That's what you want from me. To cut my hair. Concentration. - Resignment. - You misunderstand it. I might have misunderstand it, but i'll go. - Forgive me. - I leave, because i know now how you are. I'm sorry. Anna, wait! Forgive me, wait! Anna, wait for me, forgive me! Forgive me! Wait, Anna! Anna! Anna, wait! Wait, Anna! Wait, Anna! Forgive me, i'm sorry. No, Jose, not now! Pepe! Back off, Juane, back off! It's an order! Anna, i left Luchy. In this mattress, i've had three daughters. Let me go, what are you doing! - Anna! - No! Wait, Juan! I'm going to help you. You ruin everything! You ruin everything! You ruin everything! Everything! Wait, Juan, wait! You did you left me! I can't take it! Rolling down with her! With that thing! In a mattress of spiders! Boys, you're brothers, agree and don't fight. She's not worth it. - You're disgusting! - Luchy, don't move, quiet! easy! You're the boss in this house! If you'd had any authority, you'd have already kicked her! Can't you see it, she's playing with all of you? Come here. - Tell mom to come down. - Mom, come down! Luchy, please, we all love you so much! That thing with Juan was just a fleeting weakness. Right, Juan, you love her, right. - Tell her you love her. - I love you so much, come down! You treat me like a piece of furniture! Like i don't even exist! Mrs, please! Help your mother! Don't let her die! So upsetting! - I'm having an attack! - Stop it, mom, it's not the right time! Let her go! You went too far! Just about to... Jose! You're the boss Let her go! kick her. Should i go? Out! Get out of this house right now! Shut up! Shut up! No! Anna! No, please!
