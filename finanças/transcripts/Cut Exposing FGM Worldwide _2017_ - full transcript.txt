[camera shutter clicks] [Filsan] FGM is believed to be practiced across the board, um, you know, African Muslims, African Christians, at one time, um, Jewish Ethiopians, and just native religions. I remember exactly, actually, that day, like, I get goosebumps, um, thinking about it. Just that fear and stress of knowing that I was gonna be next. I don't think I've ever experienced pain to that level. [Alex] Their main tool is a razor blade. How sharp is it? Can she show us? -[woman speaks foreign language] -[Alex] Oh! [John Chua] What if the media's coverage of FGM as an African or Muslim problem has obscured its true extent and nature? My name is John Chua, and for nearly a decade I traveled the world researching FGM practices. My journey didn't start in Africa, the traditional media focal point of FGM. What if the practice touched every part of the globe, and was found in even the most unlikely of places? [Sarah] In states all across the United States, female circumcision and clitoridectomy were used in the 19th century through the mid 20th century to treat masturbation. Well, I was seven years old the day that I was cut in Central London. [John] What if there are more countries outside Africa than inside Africa where female genital cutting is a native tradition? This film examines some of these countries, 15 of them across six continents. [John] My gender, Chinese ethnicity, and profession as a writer of Russian animated movies, make me an unlikely investigator of this subject. However, I am also a university professor, with interests in human behavior across cultures, religions, and continents. But I didn't set out originally to investigate FGM worldwide. In reality, my journey was both unexpected and unplanned. But once I began exploring the puzzle that is FGM, I knew I needed to uncover the rest of the story. This is a documentary about my journey, and it's my goal to show that FGM is not just an African or Muslim problem but a global one, one affecting people worldwide to this very day, including to my surprise, my extended family and friends, people I had known for much of my life, but whose stories had remained unspoken. Small and big communities around the world have their own native cutting traditions. People on every continent, except Antarctica, have cut to control their fears of female sexuality. [Renee] My mother took me to a doctor, who said, "Well, I can fix that," and cut off my clitoris. [Anne-Marie] And Type Four is all other categories, which can be pulling or tugging, or it could also be cutting and lacerations as I've seen done in Northern Nigeria. [John] Nearly a decade ago, this project began almost by accident when I started a voluntary program training ordinary Iraqis to be digital media producers, and through my work there, I met Iraqi activists on a quest to expose and end FGM in Iraqi Kurdistan. Thrust into a world I knew very little about, and compelled by the stories I was hearing, I ended up producing a couple of their short films. What I learned, I would end up seeing again and again throughout my travels. The initial reaction to FGM is often disbelief and denial. [John] In reality, we found that in some districts of Kurdistan, FGM was almost universal. The explanations for FGM are often irrational. [John] FGM is sometimes found in difficult to access regions. Whether because of war, hostile cultures, or extremely conservative societies where other violations against women are commonly found, the results, however, are the same. These are places where few visitors risk asking questions. [John] With help and education, entire communities can be persuaded to stop their cutting practices. In Iraqi Kurdistan, the story became a positive one. The scale of FGM was shocking, but with the help of local activists and media campaigns, attitudes were changed, and a new anti-FGM law was passed in the Kurdish provinces. Within less than a decade, the majority of Kurds in Iraq turned against FGM. [John] Sadly, this was not the success I saw everywhere. Turning my attention in Iraq south, to Baghdad, what I experienced there was chaos. Shiite Muslims against Sunnis, tribe against tribe, neighbor fighting neighbor. Conventional wisdom told me that outside Africa, FGM is found mostly among the Sunnis, especially Sunnis of the Shafi'i school. But here I discovered something very different leading me to another important FGM lesson: Never fully trust conventional wisdom. Dr. Maha Al-Sakban is one of the heroes exposing FGM in the Shiite dominated regions south of Baghdad. [Maha] We used to think that, uh, FGM is prevalent only in Kurdistan and is not prevalent in our area. In the middle and south part of Iraq, I selected two provinces, Al-Qadisiyah and Wasat. From each province we took a sample of 500 women. [John] In more recent years, a trend also began for older Muslim women to undergo FGM. [Maha] But now, elderly women, they go willing to doctors and they ask them to do it for them, either for cosmetics or because they want to go to Hajj. And they think that to go to Hajj, they need to be clean. [John] And then, there's also ISIS. The UN has confirmed that militant Islamist group ISIS has ordered all women and girls in Mosul to undergo female genital mutilation. UN official Jacqueline Badcock said the fatwa, or religious law, applies to females between the ages of 11 and 46. [newswoman] News from Mosul has largely been dictated by the so-called Islamic State or "DAESH" in Arabic. The suppression of women is central to IS ideology. They can't leave their homes without a male relative. [John] Soon after the UN statement appeared, some commentators claimed that the whole story was a hoax. So we tried to find out for ourselves. But at this point, it was impossible to get into Mosul, a city of certain death for outsiders. The closest we made it was this road, controlled by Islamic State, where we could see trucks delivering supplies from ISIS controlled territories in Syria. [John] What I was beginning to learn, was that the question of where FGM occurs, is almost as controversial and surrounded by half-truths as the practice itself. This 2016 article citing UNICEF states: [woman] "The practice of FGM "is mostly limited to Central Africa. "It's not common in Morocco or Algeria "or Libya or Saudi Arabia or Oman or Jordan or Syria or Iran." [John] But after what I learned in Iraq, for me, the statement rang false. Clearly, my journey would take me in a different direction. [rhythmic drums, instruments playing] [chanting] Iran, I knew this would not be an easy place to film. Independent documentary filmmaking is not allowed. But is it really true that FGM is not common there? Although Iranians are predominantly Shiite Muslims, there are also significant Sunni and Kurdish communities. [John] The Balochis are an ethnic group of almost 10 million people that inhabit an area stretching from Iran, through to Afghanistan, and into Pakistan. I found myself asking, how big could this problem really be? And just how many pieces of this FGM puzzle are there? You will have heard little about female genital cutting in Oman. Research there has been nearly impossible without government approval. But two activists, one from the north, the other from the south, have been quietly gathering data under very difficult circumstances. And I was lucky enough to interview them. [John] In the south, what has your research been mostly about? [John] What were the numbers that you may have found in the north? [John] My investigation would not be complete without exploring the center of Islam, Saudi Arabia. There, it seems that FGM is not found among the mainstream Saudis. However, it exists among the vast number of immigrant workers brought in to keep the country running, amounting to 30% of the population of Saudi Arabia. They come from other parts of the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Additionally, FGM is also found among some of the more traditional Arabs in the southern part of the kingdom. [John] One prominent cleric with millions of followers once declared FGM a "noble act," but later, Dr. Rouzi met with him to change his mind with medical evidence. In an extraordinary turn of events, Sheikh Alarefe issued a retraction on video, withdrawing his support for female circumcision. [John] This story in Saudi Arabia taught me Islamic clerics can also play a role in ending FGM. Leaving the Middle East, my journey took me home to Southeast Asia. In recent years, the issue of FGM in Southeast Asia started appearing in the news, with reports of the practice in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country. [newswoman] The Indonesians call this female circumcision. The UN and the World Health Organization call it female genital mutilation. [John] But the scale of the issue in the region has not fully been exposed. It appears in small and large Muslim communities across the entire region, and while I focus my investigations of FGM in Southeast Asia, on Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, by chance, I also had a conversation with Cambodian Chams, an ethnic group many people don't know much about. [John] While I appear to be the first researcher to document FGM among the Chams today, to fully understand this piece of the puzzle, more research on the Chams is needed. Meanwhile, the struggle between those for and against FGM rages on in Malaysia. [John] Muslims who advocate for FGM rely on the Hadiths, or purported sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, written two centuries after his death. But some Muslims consider the Hadiths mentioning female circumcision to be weak, unreliable or inauthentic. [John] The Malaysian National Fatwa Council takes a very conservative position regarding female circumcision. In reality, within Sunni Islam across the world, not all of the various schools of jurisprudence or interpretations agree that FGM is needed. It's also done to grown women, you know. Women who have embraced Islam, for example, and consider that they need to clean themselves, they are also circumcised or cut. And imagine the kind of trauma that happens with regards to a grown woman being subjected to the cutting. The clitoris itself is removed, up to 1.5 centimeters. There's even a measurement, a standard that's used by traditional practitioners. [John] And then you run into the danger of cutting the clitoris also? [John] In Malaysia, as in many of the countries I visited, I found that supporters of FGM often had misunderstandings of the human body. [John] In multicultural Malaysia, FGM can be found among Muslims of all races and ethnicities. So I don't really identify myself as being part of a particular racial group because I am a mix of Malay, Chinese, and Serani. And also a bit of, uh, heritage from Burmese. I wasn't aware I was circumcised, partly because I was a baby back then. When I knew it, I asked my mom. She said that it is partly required under Islam. But she couldn't pinpoint exactly, like, how it is being written explicitly that it is required under Islam. Because of the religion, there's some sort of, like, underlying reason that, you know, female is a sexual being, so their sexual desires need to be curbed. It's something that is seldom being discussed even among Malay women. So I don't think even if they have problems, I don't think they would reveal it. When you ask me, whether I know or do I see the difference between myself and a woman not circumcised, I couldn't give the answer because I do not know. [John] FGM is also found among Muslim minorities in Singapore, one of the world's richest and most technologically advanced countries. Singapore is also where I was born and where I spent my childhood. Although I was raised Christian, my own extended family and friends who grew up as Muslims, were almost certainly impacted by FGM. Here, as in elsewhere, most people feel uncomfortable talking about the practice. On a recent return to Singapore, I reached out to someone I had known for most of my life, but who had never spoken to me about her horror story of being cut. [John] In Singapore, a government agency has even advocated female circumcision for its Muslim citizens, and until recently, the following statement appeared on the website of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore: [woman reading] [John] In the first study of its kind, I surveyed 119 Muslim women in Singapore. 85 of them had been cut, and a quarter of them said they would continue the practice, but many also voiced their strong opinions against it. Those who contacted me said things such as... [woman] "Because my clitoral hood is gone, "this means that my clitoris might have been desensitized, "and so I should actually be able to experience "more sexual pleasure than currently, but I will never know." [John] Also, not all mothers who took their daughters to a doctor in Singapore for circumcision were happy with the results. One wrote online... [woman] "I noticed that there was something dangling... to my horror, "seems like that the labia was cut on the top and it's blue black. "Went back to doctor... "when she saw the cut, "she kept saying that it's the labia. "She claimed the labia might reattach. "Then, before I got out the door, "she admitted she might have cut too much and apologized." [John] Recently, rumors swirled about British parents bringing daughters to Singaporean medical clinics for circumcision, but when we called the clinics, they all said that they would not cut a British child. But I had to find out for myself. [father] I bought her back from America. We were living in America. She was born in America. It is not too late? Okay. [John] In Iraq, I learned that FGM flourishes in hard-to-reach regions, and in southern Thailand, this was no different. The Muslim Pattanis fought against Thai rule for decades, and according to experts, it is the deadliest war zone in East Asia. The hotel I stayed in was previously twice bombed by insurgents. [John] What does that mean? I'm Dr. Patimoh. I use my finger, like this. This clitoris, okay? Clitoris like this, okay? Only tip. Tip of this. Puncture wound. Small. Oh, this is, uh, Pattani Islamic Pharmacy. [John] In a remote village, I found a former midwife willing to talk. [John] Oh, yes? Has there been any requests recently? [speaking Malay] [Farida] Oh, okay. [Mariya] As an English person, a British person, I underwent this, and I know a lot of my friends who also have undergone this. When people say that FGM unhooding is no big deal, I want to tell them my story of how it was done to me. [John] The Dawoodi Bohras are a South Asian Shia Muslim sect numbering about a million members. They are predominantly in India, although migration has spread this community across the world. It seemed that my journey was taking me all over the world, but it also took me to familiar places. Um, so, I am one-quarter English and three-quarters Bohra. When I was a child of about seven years old, um, I remember one day my grandmother told me that she's taking me out. Um, and going out with grandmother was always good because she would buy something. She offered me some chocolates and candies. So I was seven years old the day that I was cut. Um, and I remember going with two family members and my cousin. And, um, I gladly went with her. I lived in the city of Mumbai. I was born and raised in London. Um, I lived in the US for a couple of years. She took me to this area called Bhendi Bazaar, which is a large Bohra area where largely the Bohra community lives. And we went to a council estate in North Central London. And it was a very small flat, um, and there was an old lady that answered the door. And she took me to one building which was a dark, dingy apartment house. There was another old lady in the room. And so went in and one of my relatives told me to take off my underwear. And I remember, at the time, not feeling comfortable with doing that. But as it was somebody I trusted, I went along with it. I was a little worried and a little scared as to where is my grandmother taking me. Because the room looked really apprehensive and, you know, dark. And grandmother just held on to my hand and said, "It's okay, come inside." And inside she took me into a room and that lady drew a curtain. And I saw the old lady take a knife um, and put the stove on, and actually just heat the knife over the flame on the stove. And I was, you know, sobbing, but grandmother gently nudged me and told me to lie down. And she held on to my hands and she told me, "This will just take a moment, "and nothing will happen to you. There'll be a little bit of pain, but you'll be fine." And I was told to spread my legs, um, and that's when she cut me. Uh, this woman pulled my pants down, without even telling me anything, and with some instrument, which was a blade or a razor, I don't know, because I was lying flat and I was crying, she cut something. And there was a sharp, shooting pain, and I started screaming and crying very loudly. But more than pain, I remember an incredible amount of blood. Um, and to this day, I still have a phobia of blood because of that incident. [Massoma] She made me wear my pants and told me, "You're done, now you can go home." And I was totally traumatized. I just went home and just started crying in front of my mother. There was a lot of pain which was there because a very sensitive part of me had been cut. And for the next eight to ten days, I had tremendous pain while passing urine. A family friend of mine, um, a male family friend wanted to get married to an American lady. Um, and the community insisted that before they perform the wedding ceremony, this lady, who was going to convert into the Bohra faith, um, be cut and FGM be performed on her as well. FGM happens all over the world, uh, from different social backgrounds, different classes. Um, after year 10, I moved to America and I finished my high school over there. And then I moved back to England, and I work for a major American investment bank. I've worked there for nine years now. So I've heard from some sources that this actually is still performed in England. And, in fact, it's performed actually on the premises of the mosque. Um, recently though I have to say that the local community leaders have issued a letter, uh, saying that it shouldn't be performed in England, and that it's illegal. But up until recently, I've heard that it has been performed here. But I know of women who have no medical background, um, but are elder, who have performed this on children. [John] In the UK, FGM has been illegal since 1985, but no one yet has been convicted of the crime. In Australia, FGM has also been reported in the Bohra community. Unlike in the UK, however, the Australian Bohras have not been able to escape justice. A brutal crime under the guise of a cultural custom is taking place in Australia. [newswoman] Female genital mutilation is a crime in Australia and it's not sanctioned in the Koran. Police made a breakthrough, arresting and charging eight people with the alleged genital mutilation of two young girls in Sydney and Wollongong. It's also common for the women doing the cutting to charge a fee for their services. [Imam] The figure could be as much as two to three thousand [Australian] dollars. Uh, it is a very clandestine practice. [newswoman] The eight people arrested all belong to the Dawoodi Bohra community in New South Wales. The reality is that they are not qualified at all. These are women from a village who have now migrated, for example, to Australia, uh, who have, you know, access to a razor blade. [John] Australia has a special significance to me. Although I don't live there, Australia's where my immediate family members emigrated to. Australia has been quick to point to immigrants as the perpetrators of FGM. But I found that the connection between FGM and immigrants was not the whole story. Walter Roth, a British doctor assigned to the Australian Outback in the late 19th century, published in 1897, a report on the Northwest Central Queensland Aborigines. [male narrator] "Among the Pitta-Pitta and neighboring tribes, "a young girl when she first begins to show signs of puberty, "two or three men get the young woman, "throwing her down, "one of them forcibly enlarges the vaginal orifice. "The actual operator, "sitting astride the woman's chest and neck, "cuts with a stone knife into the perineum "downwards and forwards, "turning the implement slightly upwards "at the close of the incision. "Other men come forward from all directions, "and the struggling victim has to submit in rotation "to promiscuous coition with all the bucks present. "Should any sick individual be in camp, "he would drink the bloody semen "collected from her subsequently. "There is no doubt, "especially with the use of the stone knife, "that the perineum itself is actually lacerated and cut, "i.e. more or less ruptured. "I have had dozens of opportunities "for making suitable examination "in cases of venereal disease and verifying the fact." [John] Some people today might find his report hard to believe. But his descriptions and illustrations of the cutting of male genitals are arguably factual. [male narrator] "The man on top holds the penis firm and tense with both hands. "A deeper incision is next made with the same stone knife "along the same line as the first, "and starting from the external orifice, "opens up the canal as it is pushed onwards, "opening up almost the whole of the penis. "I have designedly introduced the term 'introcision,' "because of, and so as to include, the corresponding mutilation of the females." [John] While there are other unverified reports that FGM is a native practice found in the Northern Territory of Australia, it is unclear if female genital cutting among aborigines still exists, but male genital cutting does. Mutilation of the penis can still be found among some of Australia's aborigines. Clearly, old traditions survive into the modern world, and this suggests that FGM in Australia requires further research. With my experience of living and working in Russia, I was curious about the FGM puzzle there. There are more Muslims in Russia than in any other European country, but FGM is not found among most Russian Muslims. It does exist in the Muslim areas of the Russian Caucasus, and this project would not be complete without investigating Dagestan. [John] A center of militant Islam, Dagestan was dubbed the most dangerous place in Europe by the BBC. It sits on the western edge of the Caspian Sea, and there, yet again, I initially found only denial. In your e-mail to me you mentioned that this female circumcision here is a myth. [John] After an NGO called Russian Justice Initiative published a report about the nature and extent of FGM in Dagestan, Mufti Ismail Berdiyev, a member of the Russian Presidential Council for Cooperation with Religious Associations, caused a storm of controversy by defending female circumcision, recommending the procedure to all women. [John] We began with a phone call to a gynecologist in Makhachkala. [Hadizhat] Hello? [John] Later, I got an interview with Dr. Azhubova, but she did not want her face to be shown. [laughter] [John] Dagestani native, Svetlana Anokhina, writes for the publication "Daptar." She has long been exposing the deplorable situation in the Caucasus, and in our call, she describes a much darker picture than that portrayed by Dr. Azhubova, with primitive instruments being used and rumors of a girl dying from blood poisoning after FGM. [John] Given Svetlana's knowledge and expertise, I just had to meet her. As I found elsewhere, where there's FGM, other human rights violation against women might also be found. [John] But why doesn't the law prevent honor killing, incest, female genital cutting, and other violations against women? [John] In Russia, a number of journalists who reported on the Caucasus and have been critical of the situation have been assassinated. [John] Once again, FGM is obscured by violence and political problems. Dagestan is also a major exporter of jihadists to Syria, fighting for Islamic State, which operates on the basis of Salafism, subscribing to apocalyptic beliefs about the end of the known world. [John] The week before we arrived, ISIS claimed responsibility for a roadside bomb, which killed ten police officers near the airport. This is not the first time apocalyptic cults have been linked to FGM. But this extraordinary story from Russia's past is far removed from the one linked to Islam. For over 150 years, a breakaway Russian Orthodox Christian sect, the Skoptsy, believed in extreme forms of genital cutting, while awaiting the apocalypse. Renouncing sex entirely while awaiting the Second Coming of Christ, the now largely forgotten sect, reportedly had more than 100,000 members by the early 20th century. Skoptsy can be translated as "the castrated one." Believers cut off their sex organs, either only the testicles or often the entire penis as well. They were literally following the scripture in the Bible which describes how some chose castration as a path to heaven. I conducted an online interview with the foremost expert on the Skoptsy in Russia. [Alexander] "And there are eunuchs "who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven." [John] Both the czarist and Soviet governments were horrified by the sect, persecuting them intensely. In one of the archives of Moscow, I found a copy of the report commissioned by the czarist government to study the Skoptsy. [John] It contains one of the earliest description by a European doctor of Type Three FGM. For the women, in the first stage, they cut only the nipples, and in the second stage, the entire breast. Yet for some women, they cut the clitoris and the labia, with the subsequent healing of the wound partly sealing the vagina. [John] The Skoptsy showed that the human desire for genital cutting, as well as the fear of sex and female sexuality could suggest a sort of collective madness, which is not exclusive to one ethnic group or religion. By now, it was clear to me that this was no longer just an Africa, or even an African and Muslim problem. The pieces of the FGM puzzle were taking me to places I had never expected and to every corner of the Earth. Colombia, South America. Certainly not the first place one thinks of when the term FGM comes up. But here too, it is found. [John] The Emberas live in difficult terrain, stretching beyond Colombia from Panama to Ecuador. But now, their stories are beginning to be told. For many decades, they were caught in the middle of a war zone, with government forces on one side, and narco producers and armed rebels on the other side. Yet again, FGM exists in areas of violence. [John] There are no laws specifically against FGM in Colombia, effectively tying the hands of prosecutors, but during his long career as a state prosecutor, Victor Martinez learned of the existence of FGM among the many indigenous tribes of Colombia. [John] Experts have tried to explain FGM in Colombia as "coming out of Africa." Even the media has picked up on this. [John] My interviews got me questioning how African slaves could have introduced FGM to so many indigenous tribes across such a wide area of Colombia, and even into other parts of Latin America. More importantly, there's proof that the practice dates back centuries, to the pre-Columbian era. I found that proof, in Peru. There are positive stories in the fight against FGM. Stories like my experience in Iraqi Kurdistan, of communities embracing change and fighting the practice. Another such story is about the Peruvian Shipibo. It is a story that tells of how FGM had been going on for centuries, long before the arrival of African slaves. And yet, slowly yielding to pressure from Peruvian society and Christian missionaries, this practice has now died out. The Shipibo performed FGM during their Ani Xeati puberty festivals, lasting several days. [Shaman singing initiation song] It's a delicate issue. I mean, they do not talk about this freely with anyone. But, uh, they talk about this with their daughters, for example. Yeah, I wasn't going to tell you this, but since I will after all, they only cut the clitoris. [John] Anthropologist Carolyn Heath lived among the Shipibo for nearly 13 years, and when I met her in Oxford, at the end of our interview, she mentioned two Shipibo women we should talk to, Kayla Roxas and Sara Flores, who could be willing to talk. She did not have their contact information, but her suggestion was enough to take me to Peru. And in a section of the Peruvian Amazon of about 300,000 people, I went door-to-door knocking on Shipibo shops to try to locate them. [woman] Uh-huh. About six months or a year before the fiesta took place, they would send out invitations by word of mouth to... family and friends in all the different villages. They would do this by sending people out in canoes with drums. And they would go from village to village. When everybody was very, very drunk, they would actually hold the circumcision ceremony. [Carolyn] Yes, this was supposed to attenuate uh, these animal instincts, the circumcision, generally. And the circumcision would be carried out by the godmother using a knife made from parka bamboo. Very, very sharp. They never felt a thing at the time because they'd had so much alcohol to drink. [indistinct chatter in Spanish] And, uh, my own interpretation is that has to do with, uh, ethnic identity and to become a real, complete woman. [John] The xebinantis, worn by freshly cut females to help seal their wounds, have been radiocarbon dated to a time before the arrival of Columbus and African slaves. FGM, it seems, is native to South America after all. Why then did such an ancient practice die out? Oscar Espinosa thinks it was the end of isolation among the Shipibo that slowly eradicated the practice. It disappeared mostly because of, uh, I think, pressure of other Peruvian people, or the churches, different, uh, churches in the region, uh, for whom these kind of, uh, rituals, especially the, uh, the, um, the cutting of the female genitalia would mean like savage customs. [John] But that doesn't mean FGM vanished everywhere. The more I looked, the more clues I found that FGM exists among many other indigenous people of Latin America. [Oscar] There are Brazilian Kaxinawa and Peruvian Kaxinawa. There are some references, especially among the Kaxinawa, there are some references of, uh, similar customs of cutting the female genitalia. And probably also among other Pano groups in the Amazon region between Peru and Brazil. [John] Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and now South America. FGM is a global problem, emerging in different countries at different times, and often independently of each other. When I first began, I had no idea that over and over again, I would see similar situations to the ones I saw in Iraq on every continent except Antarctica. But what about the United States? Could the mad urge to control sexuality, female sexuality, also have a tradition there? As my journey reached its final stage, I realized that it did, involving, at its heart, a name well known to all of us from our breakfast table. FGM has a long and forgotten history in the US. From the 1860s to the 1960s, some Christian doctors and parents recommended female genital cutting to prevent girls from masturbating. It is a piece of history that many Americans would now prefer to forget. A leading proponent of removing the clitoris to prevent masturbation, was Dr. John Kellogg, the inventor of Corn Flakes. In his book, he advocated burning the clitoris with acid or removing it entirely as a cure for masturbation. When I was three years old, my mother was concerned about the fact that I was masturbating, said she had read someplace that it was the ultimate sin. Took me to a doctor in a clinic in North Dakota, who took me into a hospital in Minnesota and removed my clitoris. That was 22 years ago. And I didn't even know that it was videotaped. [John] Back in 1994, Renee wanted to remain anonymous. She was not a scheduled speaker and her talk was spontaneous and unplanned. The only clue to find her was the name of the meeting itself. I contacted anyone I could find who was there, and amazingly someone remembered her name. After several months of searching, I managed to meet her and convinced her to go public with her full story. [Renee] And I didn't even know it existed. Then Dr. Chua also found this video. And so, it's just really quite amazing to me that it has been out there for over 20 years, and I didn't... And there has been no response to it, until now. In my research, I started really in the 1860s, um, looking at when female circumcision and clitoridectomy was used to treat masturbation. Um, and I started then because that's really when medical journal publications really started to proliferate in the United States, and so you start actually seeing published cases of the use of female circumcision or clitoridectomy to treat masturbation during the mid 19th century period. I was three years old when it happened to me. Um, my mother was concerned that I was masturbating and my little face turned very red. So she took me to a doctor, um, who said, "Well, I can fix that," and cut off my clitoris. I remember... the pain. I remember seeing my mother at the end of the table. She said that she held me and walked the hospital floors until I quit crying. As I was growing older, she told me she knew it was a mistake and that I was not supposed to ever talk about it. Kellogg's Corn Flakes was created, somehow and advertised as being able to stop masturbation. And my mother if she caught me as I was growing older would say, "Stop that, it will make you insane." A lot of Americans don't know about this particular type of history, this practice within the United States historically, um, is because it was a quick procedure, and it was done in a physician's office. And, also, because probably it wasn't something that families probably really talked about amongst themselves either, largely because of the reasons it was done. [John] John Kellogg was not the only physician advocating this practice. Well into the mid 20th century, the mindset continued to linger. Dr. Harold Shryock was a prominent member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church and the dean of Loma Linda University medical school, a well-known education and research institution associated with the Adventist Church. Today, the Church plays a major role against FGM, as evident in their campaigns and medical treatments for survivors. But back in 1951, Shryock published the book "On Becoming a Woman." Still available as an e-book on Amazon and on the Seventh Day Adventist website, the text recommends female circumcision as a prevention for masturbation. I had this uncomfortable tugging in my genital area. And when I got my driver's license at age 15, I went up to the clinic and said, "Some stupid doctor did this to me and now I'm really uncomfortable." And this was a Seventh Day Adventist clinic. And the doctor gave me a book on the sin of self-pleasuring. [John] Ultimately, the Adventists were not the only Christians of that era who believed in female genital cutting. But there now seems to be a collective amnesia that prominent American doctors such as Kellogg and Shryock had advocated for FGM at one time. He actually advocated the use of circumcision or the cutting of female genitals. I did not know that. -No? It's in his books. -I've never-- -Um, yeah. -Is that true? It's in his books. Well, now there's a subject to go back and look at. [female narrator] "When masturbation becomes a habit, "she adopts an attitude of stupidity. "The remedy consists of a minor surgical operation spoken of as circumcision." I am surprised by that, but I can tell you for sure the official position of the Church today would be totally against that. I don't know that anybody reads Harold Shryock today. That doesn't have anything to do with who we are today. So female circumcision and clitoridectomy were used in the 19th century through the mid 20th century to treat masturbation. And in the 19th century, masturbation was believed to necessitate treatment because it was seen as being debilitating to the body. [John] The number of women in America who were cut and are still alive today is unknown. So in the 1960s, was the last published case of a physician referring to the use of clitoridectomy to treat masturbation. I was about three years old probably at that time. I have a very vivid memory of the experience. I was in a bed with crib bars on it. I remember standing and being very frightened, not knowing what's going on, but feeling that something terrible was about to happen. And I remember being laid down in a room. I can remember people talking to me, coaxing me through the procedure. And then I remember this excruciating pain, as my clitoris was pulled from my body and removed. [Renee] The most dangerous ramification of genital cutting is difficulty giving birth. My scar did not stretch. So my first child was in danger of becoming stuck in the birth canal. I've had an extensive episiotomy. And a couple of months after the birth I came back to my doctor, saying, "I'm not healing." This is a challenge for doctors who are not expecting this complication. Without medical intervention, I, like many mutilated women, could have died in childbirth. I get asked often how common female circumcision or clitoridectomy was practiced in the United States. And I would to say... What I always say to people is, it's not... It was never rare, but it also wasn't common. The fact that it was performed, um, in states all across the United States, and I know that from where the physicians were publishing about it, what I always tell people again is it wasn't rare but it wasn't common. It was kind of in-between there. Where did American physicians learn about female circumcision, clitoridectomy? Um, from what I can tell, they would have gotten information most likely from British medical journals. Uh, because British medical journals were publishing about the procedure in the earlier 19th century and American physicians would have read about the procedures from there. That's at least the one source that I can identify through text of saying-- This... There's a... This is how physicians would have probably learned about it, would be from the British publications about it. One of the most notorious practitioners of female circumcision, or rather clitoridectomy, he just performed clitoridectomy, was Isaac Baker Brown, who was a British physician, who in the 1860s, the British medical press published a lot about it, because he was charged with performing the operation too commonly. [John] Dr. Isaac Baker Brown was a prominent 19th century gynecologist who was also the president of the Medical Society of London. He operated and practiced in Connaught Square, in Central London. There, he advocated cutting off the clitoris to cure insanity, epilepsy, and a number of other illnesses. There was an idea physicians had, particularly in the 19th through the early 20th century, that the sort of clitoris size indicated, um... could indicate to them masturbation or what they would have deemed as homosexual behavior or that that also a larger clitoris was sort of deemed with hypersexuality. Certain bodies, particularly bodies, um, of women of color, were seen as being inherently hypersexual. This idea goes back, though, to that they could read the body by looking at it, and that the clitoris would sort of tell them, and one of the ways that it was sort of believed to be seen on the body, there was an expectation that the body would manifest itself of hypersexuality, through this sort of elongated or enlarged clitoris. [John] My journey took me from the deserts of the Middle East, to the streets of America. But still, I wondered, is FGM still occurring in the US today? Forty-four-year-old Dr. Jumana Nagarwala is charged with genital mutilation, conspiracy and lying to federal agents, facing up to life in prison at this point. [newsman] One girl, said it was done, "Get the germs out." The other girl said she screamed, got a shot, and it was so bad, she "felt pain down to her ankle," according to court documents. There are cases where families think it's safer to take their child to a clinic to get cut. There is a large Somali community in Minnesota. A lot of times when parents are taking their kids during the off months from school, um, either back home to Somalia or to different Middle Eastern countries, um, like Dubai or Egypt, and they're taking their kids to get cut. And just this last week there was an Egyptian young lady who passed away due to female genital cutting. [John] But some activists point out, not all FGM is illegal or being carried out in secret locations. Shocking as it may seem, some critics alleged that FGM exists in the beauty industry. Because by the World Health Organization's definition, it does, but is that really FGM? I am a board certified plastic surgeon. I'm also a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons. My concern is that in the practice of what I perform, the World Health Organization, which includes the United States, is stating that what I perform is female genital mutilation, and it's not. Essentially, let's talk about clitoral hood reduction. I am removing a portion of the redundant skin, from the clitoral hood, which is the fleshy skin part that covers the clitoris, and reducing that. Now by definition, that would be a [Type] 1A. In the other parts, any of those including Type 2A, where I am cutting, trimming, reducing the labia minora, would fall into a 2A. And Type 4, I'm saying that's anybody who goes to a tattoo parlor right now and gets a clitoral hood piercing, tattoos, ornamentation, dermabrasion, laser hair removal, which is a form of cauterization. Social attitudes regarding, um, FGM is really interesting, because on the one hand, you can have a female who gets vaginal piercings or tattoos or what have you, and that is viewed as really cool. Where, on the other hand, you can have a female, um, who has been circumcised, and there is a stigma that follows it. Um, it's really hard to understand why one is attached to a stigma and the other one is viewed as cool. As the standards get higher, people become increasingly more self-critical of what perfection is. And they're seeking that perfection. The problem is that there is no standard. The only understanding, I guess, or explanation that could be attached to this is cultural prejudice. I'm saying this because I'm against FGM. I don't want anybody to think that I'm supporting FGM in any way or shape or form. I'm just giving you perspective. One effect of the mutilation that continued for 50 years was the scar tissue, um... causing a tugging sensation, that did not stop until menopause, and my scar tore apart. It was a painful experience, and I think about women throughout the world, whose scars were much more intense and, uh, extensive than mine, and wonder what their experiences have been with the discomfort, the ongoing discomfort. Uh... And this makes me very sad. [Filsan] Our backgrounds are completely different, we come from two different parts of the world, yet we share something that's very intimate, and we've been through that experience together. So there's a level of understanding between us. Um, and I think it's really important for people to know that this does not affect just one community or one religion or one group of people. It's something that happens around the world. And for me, meeting Filsan has meant, um... I can discuss things that I couldn't discuss with my friends or my family who haven't experienced it. But we can share this at, um... the emotional level, as well as the cognitive level of what it has meant. This is not my shame. The shame belongs to our culture, the medical profession, um... and I no longer, um... feel that I need to stay silent. ♪
