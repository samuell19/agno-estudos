Subtitles by explosiveskull Mayday. Mayday. Engine failure. We are in a spin. Mission Control, can you hear me? Engine failure. Mayday! We're in a spin! I can't pull us out of it! Can anybody read me? Crew, prepare yourself for impact! We're going in hot! Hmm? Analyzing. Oxygen detected. What? This is Captain Max Cloud. Over. Repeat. This is Captain Max Cloud. Do you read? Over. We read you, Max. You're breaking up, but we read you. Thank God you're alive. The galaxy would be lost without you. We jumped into hyperspace and had a total loss of all power upon reentry, but I'm Max Cloud, and I don't have time for death. Good news is we have your location. - And the bad? - Your location. I'm afraid you've come down on Alpha Zed-3. Alpha Ze... Oh, shit. We've landed on Heinous. Woah. Uh, Heinous? Sorry. Why is that a, um, "I'm afraid you have" type of situation? The entire planet of Heinous is a prison for the galaxy's most dangerous, violent, and immoral criminals. That's far from ideal. I'm afraid so. Sit tight. A rescue ship will be with you in six hours. Okay. Six hours, not a problem. Let me just sweep the rest of the ship, look for other survivors, and check that the main hull of the ship has not been breached. I'm gonna gamble it may have been. What's your name, soldier? Jake, the chef. Chef? I have literally cooked you food every day for the past... six months. Well, Max Cloud meets many people. I mean, like three times a day every day. Time to move. We need to sweep the rest of the ship, look for other survivors. Do you copy me, soldier? Yeah. Yeah. Sweep the ship and, uh, look for survivors. I said, "Do you copy me, soldier?" I just did... Oh, right! Uh, um, yeah, copy that. Your Greatness, I... Do not enter on my personal time, Scavenger. Revengor, this is worth the interruption. How rude. Unless it is something from my top 10 list of wanted items, step off. You have perked my curiosity. Surely not top five. Yes! No. No. The tension is mounting. No. Yes. Ah! Yes! I knew this day would come. How exciting. Hello. Sarah Noble here, unofficial world gaming champion. How are you doing, Cowboy? Hey! How you know it was me? 'Cause you're the only one who ever calls me. And I can hear you chewing a hot dog. From a tin for the win. So you coming tomorrow? Ucch. No. Dad's heading out, so I have to stay in and wait for a delivery for him. So? You can come out for a bit. He won't know. I can't. I'm not allowed, Cowboy. I promised him I wouldn't go out. I gotta go. Yeah, I know. You gotta go. Night, Sarah. Good night, Cowboy. Sarah! Make sure you turn that console off before bed, or it'll overheat. I will. I always do. Uh, Dad, what did I tell you about knocking? Well, I would knock if I thought I was gonna catch you doing something other than playing those damn games. Oh, but I'm so close to finishing it, though. You know what? No, that's it. I'm banning all video games this weekend. Come on, Dad. Get a grip. You can't speak to me like that and expect to get away with it, Sarah. Now turn it off. Now. No, sure. You got it. You know, your mother hated you being on that thing all the time. Jeez. You have serious issues, man. Watch it with that back talk, young lady. Huh. What's this? No way. Secret room? How have I never seen this before? I'm the Space Witch. I know all. I know everything about you, your every desire. I'm sorry. Did you just say, "Space Witch"? Yeah, Space Witch. But you're a... Well, I mean, you look like a man. So? Well, wouldn't that make you a space wizard? Woah! How dare you? Men can be witches as well, I'll have you know. Nonsense! A man could be a witch as much as a woman could... captain a ship. Yeah, well... I'm trying to help you, Max Cloud. Don't be a douche bag. Max Cloud does not need help from weird man witches. That's actually quite hurtful. No, Max, maybe we do. Sarah, who are you... Sarah, what did I just tell you? You know, if you're gonna behave like a child, then I'm gonna have to treat you like a child. No, Dad, don't turn it off. Okay, I think I just found an Easter egg. This might be the last time I find this place. Dad, please. I'm confiscating your controller. You'll get it back when you learn to have a little respect. No! Don't! What am I meant to do? Don't! You're just... You're just being mean. So unfair. I wish I could just play video games all day, every day, and no one could ever stop me. Sarah... see you later. There's a pizza in the freezer. I won't be back 'til late. Call me if you need anything. Okay, I'm going. Yo! There's a package at the back door! Want me to bring it up? Fear is not near. Cowboy is... here. Sarah! Ser! Where you at? Huh. Okay. Jake? Who plays as Jake? I didn't even know you could switch characters. This is a dark moment. All right. Jake, the useless chef, it is. Where did that Space Wizard go? Behind me. Max Cloud always leads the way. Max Cloud? What the... Hell, you... you are Max Cloud, aren't you? Is this real? Yes, I'm real. I am Max Cloud, intergalactic space hero and captain of this ship, and you are someone who makes food or something. What is wrong with you, soldier? We've already done this. I c-can't believe I'm standing in front of Max Cloud. I must be dreaming. C-Can I touch you? Stand down, soldier, immediately. Okay. All right, this is a dream. This has to be a dream. I mean... it feels real. I mean, you feel... Huh? And I feel... Pull yourself together, soldier! We don't have time for this! Okay. Okay. Whatever the hell is going on here... I'm in a spaceship... with Max Cloud. That is insanely cool. Cowboy? Holy smokes! Cowboy, i-is that you? How are you doing that? Uh, let me pause this. Weird. Game won't pause. See, this is what I'm telling you about secondhand games, super sketchy. This one is definitely sketchy. That's for sure. - I'll just restart it. - No! Okay. I mean, you're not even that far in. You have to promise me you won't restart the game or hit the power. - Okay. - Promise me. Yeah, I promise. What is going on? Don't freak out. I am a paragon of chill, all right? I'm just gonna come straight out with it. I'm pretty sure I'm in the game. Uh, good one. Now come on. Come out. Where are you? In the game. I can see Max Cloud in the flesh. He's standing right in front of me. Sarah, this is a really weird joke. I'm looking at a screen right now, and all I can see is Max Cloud and Jake, nobody else. What?! Oh, God, I knew it. I'm Jake, aren't I? Oh, why couldn't I have turned into Max? Seriously? Jake's literally the worst. I've seen Big. I've seen Fred Savage's magnificent Vice Versa, so I know these things are possible. Help me, Cowboy. I went to bed, and the next thing I know, I'm here on Max Cloud's spaceship. This... this... this is so cool! Look, if... if you're Jake and I'm playing as Jake, does that mean I'm controlling you? Uh, I guess so. Aw, man, this is so awesome. What's the danger, soldier? You doing it? Yes, I'm doing it. Now stop. But it's so funny. Y-you're making me look stupid in front of Max. Okay. Party pooper. Heh. Must be something in the atmosphere, sir. Y-you need to watch out for that. I need to watch out for that? You need to watch out. What if I can't get out? I didn't think of that. What do we do? Okay, Sarah, keep it together. You know this game. Figure this shit out. The Space Witch. Space Witch? Okay, Cowboy, there's a Space Witch hidden somewhere on Max's ship. - We need to find him. - Him? I think he might be my way out of here. - Okay. How do we do that? - Well, I don't know, Cowboy. I'm currently stuck inside a video game. - Can you get some help? - I can't leave, Sarah. The game won't pause, and you only have one life left. Then we only have one option right now. You have to play. Okay. That's no pressure, then. I'm gonna need some nutrition. Okay. You got this, buddy. Cowboy, concentrate. And don't talk with your mouth full. What was that? Uh, wait. Um, before you go all hunter-killer mode, you might not want to go in there. We left the deck seconds ago. - It's empty. - Ah! But there's a hole in the deck, big hole. Well, if there is something in there, it's not gonna be very friendly, so whatever's on the other side of those doors, we kill. Is that understood? "We"? Yeah. Okay, concentrate, Cowboy. Okay, then. Who wants the first dance? Finish him. K.O.! Round one. Fight! - Perfect. - Ho! K.O. Hah! Fear is not near. Max Cloud is here. Not bad. Not bad at all. That guy's head came completely off his shoulders. Now all we need to do is figure out a way to block that hole. Uh, we need to get the plasma-gun thing, and then we sling them up there, and then we fire. I have a plan. Take this. On my cue... Uh, Cowboy... Mm-hmm. Okay. Ready? 3, 2, 1... Let's move. You excited to meet my girl? My English rose? In your dreams. Just tell her Cowboy says hi. She'll know what it means. I'd be pretty concerned if she didn't know what "Hi" means, Cowboy. Identify yourself. I said, "Identify..." Commander Rexy. I'm gonna need visual confirmation on that. - It's me, Max. - Who? Who are you? Max, I know you know it's me. How do you know that I know it's you? Ah, Commander Rexy. Captain, thank goodness I found you. The galaxy depends on you. You're the only space hero who can save this ship. We'd be doomed without you. Tell me what happened, Commander. Where's the rest of my crew? Dead. Fully dead. Mission report, Commander. You're so annoying. Rexy's kinda different here. She's... she's sassy. You're just saying that 'cause you're jealous. What happened, Commander? Well, the last thing I remember was jumping into hyperspace. When I came to, the ship was torn apart, and I was floating. - Floating where? - In space. I pulled myself back on board, and here I am. - Ah. - We're the only survivors. Everyone else is dead. Hmm. Yeah, that's basically it. The worst place we could have ended up is Heinous. Well, we might have to get used to it, Max. Nonsense! Max Cloud will not get used to Heinous. They're coming. Get ready. Well, we don't have to run into every situation head-on. 'Course we do. That's the... - Max Cloud... - Max Cloud way! Yay! I have a different idea. Since when did you start piping up? - Follow me. - Soldier! Hyah! Okay, Sarah. Let me take you somewhere safe. Max Cloud's bedroom. Well, it's kinda safe. It looks like securing the ship's out of the question. Have you lost your mind, soldier? I will kill each and every one of them. I respect you. In fact, - I admire you, but... - Well, most people do. I think... we need to be sensible about this. If we can move forward without a battle at every corner, then that would be great, because I don't want to die here. To die on Max Cloud's ship would be an honorable death, soldier. - I've got a plan. - Hmm. - Why don't we... - Hmm. just sit here and do nothing? Hmm. We could put our feet up... - Hmm. - watch a video. - Hmm. - We deserve it. Hmm. Hogwash! Commander, chef, on me. Come get some, intergalactic space scum! Max! He'll be fine. We gotta help him. If he dies, we die. Okay! We can do this. You ready, Cowboy? Sarah, this part always kills me, even when I'm playing as Max. Keep it together. Listen to my voice, and do exactly as I say. Okay. Hey. Down, A, B, B. Good work, soldier. Let's move. Yahoo! Stay focused, Cowboy. We are killing it! I've never played this well before in my life. I'm sick and tired... of you Heinous scum! It's a dead end. I scared them off with an act of pure violence. Well, what about those guys? Fall back! Follow me, soldiers! The whole planet's gone to shit! No way. Is it really... Brock Donnelly, intergalactic bounty hunter? Give me a damn good reason not to kill you. Can you see this, Cowboy? Yeah. We're lucky he hasn't killed you, too. Oh, my God, it's the Brock Donnelly. Keep your shit together! Stop fangirling, Sarah. It's embarrassing. Hello, dear. Brock Donnelly. I know. I'm Sar... I'm Jake! I'm Jake. I'm Jake. He always like that? No, not normally. Works for me. Ugh. Gross. You know, Brock's my guy, but if he even thinks about trying anything with Rexy, oh, man. Inside. Hurry up. Don't even think about it. That's Max Cloud's seat. What are you doing on my ship, prisoner? Tell him, Brock. - Tell him about the ship. - Okay. As soon as space clown here puts his gun down. No? Suit yourself, spandex. I came here tracking a bounty... Shee. Look at her. What a piece of work, eh? Wanted on over 12 different planets. I finally tracked her here to Heinous. Perfect place for a criminal to disappear, right? I was tracking her through the mountains. I knew she was close. I could almost smell the evil in the air, I mean, taste it. Then I look up into the sky, and I see the ship, and I think, "That's weird. That looks like my ship." - I realize... - It was his ship. It was my ship. So now I find myself here... helping you guys. And I'm prepared to give up a 35-year record of never losing a bounty to get off this rock, Heinous. So you gonna lower that gun? 'Cause I'm the only help you got. You have a lot more to worry about than some old space cowboy. Max Cloud, lower that gun. We do not have time for your peacocking. Okay, let's get this tin can in the sky. I will have you know that this tin can is the fastest ship in the galaxy. Now just you remember who you're talking to. I have absolutely no idea who the hell you are. But I do know one thing. If you don't listen to me, you're gonna be turned into pink larvunian lasagna in the next few hours. I can handle those degenerates out there. Don't you worry about that. Oh, listen, sunshine. It ain't the pansies out there that worry me. Oh, no. You see them two sisters up there? That's what concerns me. They remind me of these twins I knew once on Voltor-7. Crazy beautiful, make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up... until you felt a knife right up in your balls. Lovely. Get to the point, convict. Point is these two stars... every 24 hours, circle this planet, and they burn as hot as the Earth's sun, so everything on the surface of this planet is turned into space liquid. That's why the prisoners live underground. So how long do we have? - Eh, my best guess... - Eight hours, 20 minutes. Exactly. What? Oh. Uh, it was my best guess, too. Easy, cupcake. Your nerve will steady with age. Why are these shutters not working? They're not gonna get through them doors. They don't want to destroy the ship. This is not good for my anxiety. Why play it then, My Magnificence? I lose my focus, and when I lose my focus, I lose my temper! Shee, tell me about the ship. Or I should say "my new ship." Our new ship. Yes. Our new ship. That's more like it. The main part of the ship was destroyed in the crash. What?! Remember who you are speaking to. Remember what I did for you, Your Greatness. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm just under a ton of stress. The control vessel is still intact, so it will fly. Our time has come. Oh, so I will have my revenge. Shee, is this Max Cloud as handsome as they say he is? Sarah, can you hear me? Sarah, can you hear me?! Are you there?! Stop shouting! Literally no one was shouting. I was freaking out, dude. I was speaking, but I couldn't hear you. C-could you hear me? I was shouting your name. No, I only just heard you just now shouting in my ear. Thanks for that. Commander, was the power room still intact when we lost the rest of the ship? - Yes. - Hmm. Now please won't one of you masculine space heroes share your plan with the group? We get the power core, we stick it in here, and we get the hell out of Dodge. Surprisingly, I agree with the pirate. Get used to it, Lulu. Now everybody tool up. The moment these doors open, we're gonna be in a world of shit. The second sun is closing in. Time is not our friend. Swarm the ship. Find every survivor, and crush them. Rip out their spines. Cut out their hearts. Just don't damage the ship. If you do... I will eat your black hearts! Follow me. Hey. Who were you talking to back there? I have an imaginary friend. What's their name, then? Instasquitch. Uh-huh. Are you sure about this, Cowboy? Okay. We can't see anything down here. Huh? Hey. I can't see. Hoo. Huh? Huh? Huh? Hey, hey, hey. Oh. Try these. Cowboy, Brock just gave me his goggles. Put 'em on. Put 'em on. Oh. What do you see, kid? - Oh. - What do you see? They found us. Follow me. There's smoke everywhere. Take us down a level. Okay. Sure. You need to get us out of here. - It's like a maze. - I know. Just keep us away from them, Cowboy. Yeah, I'm trying. Cowboy, wait. It's okay. I can see 'em. Should be safe here. - They found us. - Oh, wait! My bad! This way, losers. Four against a team of space ninjas. I like these odds. What about you, team? Gotta know your limits, kid. Ah. Uh... shit! I cannot believe that I am complicit in this coward... Oh, shit! I know this room. Sarah, look out! Do something! Man... Commander? Help! Max! Max, we're in here! Huh? Huh? Max! Hurry up! Ho! - Hello. - Help! - Commander? - Help us, Max! Soldier, if you can hear me, do not fear! Max Cloud is here! Welcome back. You got cajónes, amigo. Oh, I wouldn't say that. It was easy. Bigger they are, the harder they fall. Ah, you ruined it. Oh. Hmm. Cowboy... Agh. Uh... what is he doing? Cowboy, turn me around. What the hell are you doing? - Uh, you okay there, kid? - Yeah! Yeah, I'm just checking out the wall. - Commander, what is he doing? - Ow. Seriously, Cowboy. Cowboy, can you hear me? - Looks like he's rubbing... - Cowboy. - himself up against the wall. - Cowboy. Cowboy, can you hear me? Where are you? What are you doing? Sarah, you still there? What the hell? Uh, my bad. But I was gonna pee in my pants, and, uh, I knew I had a few minutes while you were safe in that room. Don't do that again. This isn't a game. Yeah. This vent's all, uh, checked. Quick jerking around. We got work to do. Hang on. We need this first. Yes! That was legit. Yeah, uh, a little tap would have done it, Cowboy. I gotta be honest with you, soldier. That was pretty damn impressive. Watch this. Hmm. That was not impressive. Wait. Commander Rexy, is the core safe for handling? A safe distance of one meter must be kept from the core at all times to avoid contamination. Pussycats. The humiliation. A woman's taken the initiative. Commander, have you lost your head? You're gonna lose yours if you stay up here. Now come on, boys. Hurry up. In you go. Now you, Sarah. Wrong tunnel. No, not yet, Cowboy. Oh, come on. Get us out of here. Okay, guys, down you go. Yes. Finally. Out of my way, soldier. Hurry up, you lot! Oh, I should have never stopped my aerobics classes. Okay. Ah. What are you doing out there? Just trying to help. - Hello? - Hello. 911. - Police? - What? - Cowboy, hang up! - This is gonna sound crazy, but my friend, she's stuck in Max Cloud. - The video game? - The video game, yeah. Cowboy, they will think you're on drugs. They'll show up and turn the game off. So, uh, what can you tell me? We're on the later stages, and, uh, shit's getting crazy. No, no, no, this is a bad idea. - Okay, that's, uh... - You know, uh, just... just forget it. I'm a... I'm a crazy person. You know, wasting police time's a criminal offense, sir. You can get fined $1,000, so hang up now, please, son. Yeah, okay. Sorry about that, Sarah. It's just you and me. Well, that's good to hear. Should we help? Nah. Just leave them to it. Max and Brock have got this, okay? We've never got this far before, Sarah. I'm not gonna know what's coming. It's fine. We're gonna be fine. We just need to be relaxed. We need to focus, and we'll get through it together, okay? These two actually love it. Hey! Ah. They make it look easy. So what was the point in that back flip? Ho! Hmm. Working out? Shee! My reputation precedes me. But be assured... I am significantly crueler than even the worst stories say. Great. Woah. She is terrifying in the flesh. Ehh. Uh, Sarah, I'm kinda freaking out right now. Okay. Come on. Pull yourself together, Cowboy. Okay, come on. We're gonna need more than fists for this fight. Plasma gun. Okay, don't forget. R1 to reload. R1? J-just keep shooting. I know. Duh. Rexy! Let's do this, Cowboy. That's what I'm talking about. Rexy. Rexy! Brock, help. Rexy's hurt. Hey, it's okay. You're okay. Sarah! Brock's a bad guy? Sarah, are you okay? Ohh. Son of a bitch. You were late. What the hell?! The deal was I get you the power core and you get me my... shiiiii... - One... - Top. Transfer across. - Work it. Oh, that core. - Transfer mambo. Oh, yeah. Come on. Basic toe, hup! - Hiyah. - Pivot. Hoo! Great! - Pony on. Let's go. - One, and go. Cross your top. Come on. Transfer across... Revengor! Again. Now one more time, let's do it... Shee, don't sneak up on me. - It peaks my anxiety! - Whoo! - It makes me jittery. - Great. Pony on. Let's go. Cross your toes... I assume the presence of this space pirate means that you're almost done. - Transfer mambo. - Aw, Jesus. Space cowboy, amigo. - Space cowboy. - Ah. We've spoken about this before. I am not having a conversation with you whilst you're doing whatever it is you're doing. I'm just working on my fitness for my revenge on planet Earth. - Ahh. - Now back to body. - Come on, basic. - I'm waiting. Pivot! Great! Pony on. Go. The survivors were in possession of a power core. Brock went in, proved to be utterly useless, so I went to them myself and destroyed it. We couldn't risk them escaping. And the ship? Yeah, what about my ship, Shee? What about our deal? The prisoners are bringing it to us. Ah, the survivors. Including that devilishly handsome Max Cloud? Taken care of. - Yeah. - Woah, woah, woah. What does that mean? You said you wouldn't hurt them. Hush! Anything else? I'm cooling down here. The ship won't be long... so make sure you're ready. I'll finish my video, and then I'll pack. Across the top. Oh, and, Shee, why can I still smell Donnelly? Huh? Ahh. Across the back. Yeah, back in your box. Uh, I don't want to add to a bad situation, but Max is on his way. He took the power core. - Who? - Brock. What happened? Brock betrayed us. - I told you! - I didn't see it coming. I knew we shouldn't have trusted that criminal. You should have listened to me, Commander. He could have killed me. He just stunned me. Come on. Brock can't be a bad guy. That... Of course he's a bad guy. He's left us! Abandoned us! Left us to fry to death! It's over! There must be another way. Wh-why didn't Shee kill us? Come on! You're Max Cloud! Shee sent something else to finish the job. - End of level... - Boss. Zuko! Zuko! All right, let's do this. Come on. Hey, watch out. Guys, keep it going. Max, no! Zuko Sumo Fudge. We did it. We actually did it. Yes! Well done, Cowboy. I'm feeling pretty darn confident right now. Don't get complacent. If I actually get you out of here, you definitely owe me a date. Ehh? Wha... Max! Max is hurt! Huh. I'm fine. I'm fine. - Ohh! - What are we gonna do now? Our only power core has been destroyed, and this ship isn't going anywhere. That's strange, 'cause we appear to be moving. That sun is getting pretty damn close. Where are they taking us? This must be it, Sarah. I saw something about it in the game guide, the final levels, Revengor's Lair. They're taking us to Revengor. Revengor? He's just a myth. Doesn't mean he doesn't exist. It might be our only way out of here. You better hope that he does exist. 'Cause right now, he may be the only way out of here. And how exactly is Revengor gonna help us get out of here? Okay, found it. Oh, backstory. "Revengor hasn't always been known as Revengor. In fact, he used to be called Jeremy." Well, he used to be known as Jeremy. Jeremy? I'm not surprised. Nobody's gonna be scared of a Jeremy. Revengor, yeah, but Jeremy... I'm sorry. What's this got to do with anything? I'm trying to explain. "Before he ended up on Heinous, Jeremy worked for NASA on planet Earth." Before he ended up on Heinous, Jeremy used to work for NASA on planet Earth. He was taking his team out on a mission, and they crash-landed. Long story short, no one ever came to rescue them, and he was the only one to survive. Well, just about. He would have died if it wasn't for Shee. When she found him, he was hardly breathing. Some of his limbs were missing. She used her sorcery to fix him, bring him back up to strength. When she had... Jeremy was gone. This man was different. He was powerful, but empty, the kind of emptiness which is dark, so dark that you forget how to feel. Not totally surprising, considering he doesn't have a heart. He survives off a power core located in his chest. And so Revengor came to be. He took over the planet with Shee as his right-hand woman, and together, they rule the prisoners. "Ever since then, Revengor has been waiting for a ship..." ...so he can return to Earth and get his revenge on the planet that abandoned him. So we need to get his power core before he gets our ship. Or planet Earth is in mortal danger. The fate of the universe lies in the hands of... Sorry. That... Habit. So what do we do now? We sit tight. Hey, Sarah... FYI, you just owned the room. So what's your real name, then? Jake. She knows. H-how could she know? Tell her, Sarah. She might be able to help. I can't. See, who are you talking to when you do that? What did you mean when you said, "R1," earlier? Nothing. I-I didn't mean any... So it had nothing to do with the fact that if you keep your finger pressed down on R1 when firing, it will automatically reload your weapon? How do you know that? I'm Sofia. I'm Sarah. - Sarah? - Yeah. Nice to meet you, Sarah. Oh, my God. It happened to you, too? I've got so many questions. I don't have many answers. Are there any more of us? Look, all I know is that I've never met anyone else in here before, and the game characters, they haven't got a clue. They're oblivious, completely unaware. Have you been here long? Feels like forever. Okay. Well, we can't be stuck here forever. I mean, there must be a way out, right? What about the Space Witch? - Space Witch. - Mm. That's the last thing I remember before I ended up in here. - Me, too. - Hey, tell Sofia... Cowboy says, "What's up?" - Be quiet, Cowboy. - Eh... - Who's Cowboy? - He's my best friend. - He's controlling me. - Wait. Someone's controlling you right now? Yeah. And you can communicate with them? Is no one controlling you? No. I-I always played alone. Hang on. So if... if your friend can complete the game, then we... And we could find the Space Witch! And then we might actually have a chance of getting out of here! Yes! Please tell me your friend's not shit. - Commander. - How's the arm? It's fine. I'm sorry about Brock. It's not your fault. We weren't to know. So how does it feel... having this special little moment with Max Cloud? Do you want to finish it yourself? I'm messing with you. Well, that's something I don't often see, little smile... from the unflappable Rexy. Can I ask you something? Sure. Why do you put on the act? What act? I'm Max Cloud, - intergalactic space hero... - Come on. There's nobody else here. You really want to know? I really want to know. I never really wanted all this. Being a space hero doesn't exactly come naturally to me. So what does? Pastry. - Pastry? - Mm-hmm. I get pastry. Always have, always will, ever since I was a little kid. You know, my mother was a pastry chef. When I was younger, I used to love nothing more than helping her in the kitchen. The attention to detail. Watching her tiny hands quickly shape the most intricate and delicate of pastries. The Mille feuilles to Paris-Brest. Oh, and her Madeleines... well, they were lighter than air. She made it like an art. All I wanted to do in life was to be able to bake pastries as elegant and as beautiful as hers. But after she died, I would sneak into the kitchen and bake alone until one night, my father found me, and he sent me off to space academy. Now here I am, intergalactic space hero, but I've not baked a pastry since. You have no idea how much I envy Jake in that kitchen all day. I'm sure you can go in the kitchen if you want to. Space heroes don't have time for baking, okay? You're allowed to pass the ball, Max. Oh, yeah? Look who's talking. - You know what? - What? If you were someone different... - Yeah? - we might have been friends. Revengor's Lair or Space Slug Smackdown? Oh, no, stupid. What am I thinking? Always Revengor's Lair. Ah, Stars and Sunbeams? I've always found that quite relaxing. That might help calm me down after a hard day's revenging. Maybe I could take it out of the box. Ah, that's crazy talk. What am I saying? - The ship has arrived. - Ah. Ah, the moment we've been waiting for, Shee, it's finally here. Nothing can stop us now. I woke up this morning, and I knew today was gonna be a wonderful day full of death and retribution. You will be a magnificent captain. Yes, I know. Earth will rue the day they ever left me to rot on Heinous. It will always be your Heinous. Our Heinous. And soon it will be our Earth. I feel like celebrating. I don't know if I can do this, Sarah. What happened to, "I'm feeling pretty darn confident now"? That was postbattle buzz talking. But now I know we're heading into Revengor's Lair. I don't think you realize how serious this is. If we lose this game, we lose you, too, and I don't know what I'd do if... I believe in you, Cowboy. Okay. Okay, but you can't blame me if I pee on your carpet. - Oh, yes, I can. - Tony! Uh, Tony's here. Your dad's here. Damn it. Watch those cuss words, Sarah. - Where is she? - Uh... And you know you're not supposed to be playing this weekend. Turn it off, please, Cowboy. I-I can't. If we turn it off, she'll die and be stuck in there forever. What are you talking about? Just save the game, and turn it off. Uh... And, Sarah, you better get out here right now, young lady, or you're gonna be in big trouble. Yeah, that's sort of not possible right now. Fine. I'll turn it off. No, no, no, no, no, no. - Sorry. - Out of my way, Cowboy. Dad, it's me. I'm in the game. What? Look, Tony, you gotta listen. What the heck is going on? Just please, please listen to your daughter. Dad, it really is me. I'm stuck in here. You have to believe me. She's inside the game. Now, I know this sounds crazy, okay, but, uh... - Just... - Sarah? You there, sweetie? I-I can hear you, Dad. Please don't turn off the game. I don't want to be trapped in here forever. - I want to come home. - Okay. Okay, trust me, honey. Cowboy, open that package over there. Okay. Sarah... I have a confession to make. I'm a gamer, Sarah. Always have been. Always will be. Huh. This makes sense now. So that's what you and Mom were always arguing about. Only because of what it did to me, honey. We'll talk about this later. Right now, we gotta finish this game and get you home. You ready? I'm ready, Dad. Let's do this. Oh, man. Okay. Big Tony, you got this. You got this. That's it. Relax. End the game. I know you can do this. Are the walls moving? What are you talking about? The walls aren't... The walls are moving. Shh! Quiet, Rexy. Quiet. We need to freak out quietly. Slug... Ahh! Ohh! I hope this doesn't come off as weird, Tony, but you are magnificent. I-I'm never gonna feel clean again. You hear that? Stick with me. We've got your back, Max. Come on, Brock. Pirates like to dance. Show us some moves. Oh, yeah. Party on. Let's huddle. Okay, what do you think we should do, Rexy? - Really? - Yeah. You're smarter than I am. Just took me a while to get my head out of my own ass. - Thanks, Max. - Mm. I think we should go with Jake on this one. I say we do it the Max Cloud way, loud, brash, straight in the front door. Who's with me? The Max Cloud way. Bit much. The Max Cloud way! - Hyah! - Yay! Woah! Hey, Jeremy! Give me back my ship! Now there's a name I haven't heard in a long time. It's not as bad as I remember. Jeremy Revengor. Hmm. Oh, Max... you truly are as handsome as they say. That's right. I am beautiful! So you'd better take a goddamn good look, 'cause it's the last thing you're ever gonna see! Someone bring me his face. "Taken care of," you said. The disappointment is overwhelming. Hah! Uhh! Shee. That was a bit embarrassing. Take a timeout. Hah! Oh, what the hell is this? A conscience. Where the hell'd that come from? No! - Max! - Max! Bummer. Uh, really? Last chance, Shee. There she is. Look who has grown a spine. Come to claim your bounty, pirate? Come on, Shee. Shee! Is that all you got? Come on, Shee. Impossible. Oh, it's possible, darlin'. Brock Donnelly... never misses a bounty. The record stands. Much obliged, darlin'. Anytime. - I got this. - We got this. Every game, every final level, every boss... it was all for this. I get to fight that guy or even that guy. I fight the main guy, not the sidekicks. We don't have sidekicks. We're a team. Brock, get the others to the ship. Stand by. I'm gonna get the power core. - Let's dance! - Woah, woah. Easy there, amigo. You cannot take Jeremy on your own. Yes, he can. You've got this. Confidence. Good. Good for you. What happened? Did I save the universe again? - You were fantastic. - Ah. Let's go Fabulous. Dad? Dad! What's going on? No. This can't be happening, not now. Wh-what do we do? Oh, my God. Round one. I'm controlling myself. Ready. Fight! Ow! Ow! - Yeah! - Good work! Ow! Finish him. You win. Next round. Ready. Fight. I'll get you! Have this! You are nothing! You lose. Pick yourself up. Is that all you've got? This is why I wanted to fight the main guy. Final round. Fight! Okay, look for the pattern, Sarah. Here we go. Want some more? I will destroy you. Good move. You are irritating. Fight me! Finish him. Hah! Power move! Huh? Not the only one that can ride a glitch. Perfect! Well, that was not ex... You win! We lost you. How did you get... You know what? Tell me later. Let's get you off this planet, complete this game, and get you home. Yeah. I could not agree with you more. God, I wish I could do something! Commander... it's been an honor. I wish I could say the same. - Anyone order a power core? - Yes, Sarah! Great work, kid! Right. Time to go home. Where's Brock? He dumped Shee here and left us again. And, hey, who's Sarah? All right, soldiers, hold on to your butts. Let's do this. Max? Looks like we're still coupled to the rest of the ship. Somebody's gonna have to get out there and deal with it. Max, what do we do? What do we do?! - Uh... - Caution. Caution. It's that space pirate. What the hell is he doing?! Yee-hoo! He saved us. I was wrong about him. Something's at the door. Helmets on. - You're alive! - Ooh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy, son. But you were fully on fire. Yeah. I am Brock Donnelly. Hah! Now that was lame. That was not an explanation. There are worse places to be stuck for all eternity. I just thought if we completed the game, then that would be it, we get to go home. Dad, C-Cowboy... can you hear me? Looks like I'm stuck here. I'm so sorry, Sarah. No one's to blame. This is where I get off, amigo. Really? You're not staying? You know, I think you'd make a great addition to the team. Old Brock Donnelly's a lone wolf. Besides... I got to go collect that bounty on Shee... and get my ship back. You know, Brock, after what you've done for us, I can get you any ship in the galaxy. Mine ain't no ordinary ship. Looks like I'm going to spend all of eternity looking for that... Space Witch. Sarah! My dad, the world's greatest gamer. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Me, too. Hey! Man, it feels so good to not be in that spacesuit. Sofia. You must be Sarah. And we're in your room right now? You're a full grown-up. And you must be Cowboy. I guess I should thank you for getting us out of there. Well, it was a team effort. - Tony. - Uh... Sagittarius. Ah. Well, you certainly must know your way around a joystick, Tony. - You ready? - Fully ready. The Captain Tony way. What? I-I miss the accent. Oh, you were doing a... British accent? Hey. Hey, I'm good at it. One second. Sarah. Uh, guys! - Oh! - Dad! What have I told you about knocking? Sorry, sweetie. You guys ready? We don't want to be late for the games convention. Okay. We're coming. We were just about to take things to the next level. Excuse me? Uh, that's a games-related joke. I would never disrespect you like that, Tony, you... you brilliant, brilliant man. Do not fear! Max Cloud is here! Subtitles by explosiveskull
