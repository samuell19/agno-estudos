Hey, Kitty. I'm here when you need me. Call me. Love you. Hi, hon. Call me when you get this message. Love you. Hey, hon. It's me. Call me. Hey, hon. I'm in between meetings. I just, I wanted to say hi. I love you. Kathy. Call me, text me, send me a smoke signal. Let me know you're all right. I wanna make sure I don't lose you too. Kathy, thank God. I was getting worried. Is everything okay? I am okay. There's no easy way to say this, Kathy. My meetings are running longer, and I won't be back for a few more days. I'm sorry I can't be there with you. That's okay. I'm keeping busy. Are you seeing Dr. Myers? He's a grief counselor. I'm not grieving. You need to deal with Derek's loss, not keep denying it. He can help. He helped me. Helped you what? Accept that he's gone? He's not! The insurance company cleared his passing. We received the death gratuity. They're wrong! I am not touching that check, because he's not gone! Derek is out there lost, maybe on the streets. Do you know how many vets are homeless? It's unlikely, Kitty. You have no faith. He's out there, and you can't accept that. I'll be home soon. We'll get through this together. I love you. I have to go. My bath is ready. ♪ And it takes me back home ♪ ♪ And it takes me back home ♪ ♪ And it takes me back home ♪ Hey. Hello. Lady, hey. Lady. Wake up, would you? Well, wake up. Oh, lady. What's? Hey, what? I can help. I used to be a medic in Nam. You okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? I don't know. There's vacancy, but you have to wait to speak with Ms Sophie. You seem lost. I don't know where I am. What happened to your head? I, I, I tripped and fell. Look, I can sneak you in, and get you cleaned up, and maybe something to eat. But we have to be quick, 'cause technically you can't be here until Ms Sophie says you can. It's one of her rules. What is this place? Officially it's the Cottonwood Rescue Shelter. This is a safe haven for us. What do you mean us? The lost, the plundered, the forgotten. The streets aren't safe. Just a few days ago, a homeless man was beaten to death. Can you believe that? Do you live here? Nobody really lives here, except Ms Sophie. It's her place and her son, Bobby, and Blue. He's our security man. But he wanders off. She lets strangers stay here? Like that famous quote says, there are no strangers here, just friends you haven't met yet. Hi, I'm Amber. What's your name? You look like an Alice. I used to have an Aunt Alice. Amber! She shouldn't be here. Come on. You know the rules. Hi. Pleasure. Sophie's gonna be here any second now. This is not the way they should meet. I'm sorry. What's your name? Her name's Alice. Pleasure. I'm Maude. This isn't the way, how Sophie should meet Alice, okay? She's bleeding, and she needs help. I doubt Ms Sophie would turn her away like this. What happened? Did somebody do this to you? Is somebody maybe after you? Are we in danger? Relax. She fell. Just go keep an eye out for Ms Sophie. I'm not gonna be a part of one of your other schemes here. Just let me know when Ms Sophie gets here. Okay, fine. You talked me into it. Looks superficial, no stitches needed. Than... Someday, I'm gonna be a nurse, just like Ms Sophie. She's taught me everything I know. You could say I'm kind of like her medical assistant. Purple! My scrubs will be purple. What's your favorite color? - Hum... How long have you been out on the streets? I only ask 'cause you don't have a lot of stuff, and that's a good thing. Not that it's a good thing not to have things. Sophie's here. Maude, go into Andrew's hocus pocus bag and grab his flask. I'll just go. I don't want to get anyone in trouble. Weren't you listening, the streets aren't safe. One thing we do here is, we look after each other. Amber, Amber! I wasn't here. I want you to smell like booze. Remember, we don't want to think you're trouble, or she'll send you straight to the police station. They do terrible things to you there. It's okay. Just let me do all the talking. Amber! Stay right here. Okay? You know the rules. Everyone with two able hands helps. I was helping. Yes, Ms Sophie. Good evening to you too. Are you... hiding someone... in the bathroom? Hiding? No. No, no, no. Fixing, yeah. That's more like it. I was fixing. I would never bring someone into your house, your bathroom, especially when they're bleeding all over the floor. You are a horrible liar. Lying is bad. Maude already told me. I'm sorry. But you know how it is. When Sophie looks at you, How could you snitch on me? You're my best friend. I am your best friend, but you asked me to lie. I didn't have time to clean up. That's enough. Who's in the room? This woman was drunk, and she fell. And I met her outside, when I was reading my nursing textbook. You know, the one about ligaments and muscles. People have those, right? The muscles, and eyelashes, and elbows. She needs help. Are you all right? What happened to you? She fell down, somewhere. I fell. How many fingers do you see? Two. No immediate signs of concussion. For a more in depth diagnostic, you'll have to go to the county hospital around the corner. Have you been drinking? Yes Ma'am. What were you drinking? Wine. Lots of it. Please don't send me to the police. What's your name? Alice. Well, Alice, I'm Sophie Hagan. This is my place. Our place. We help everyone who needs it. But there are rules to follow, and you will have to come back tomorrow. Please, Sophie. She has know where to go. Is that right? Please. I vouch for her. Well, it looks like someone has taken a liking to you. I remind her of her Aunt. Well, I'm not gonna break total protocol. Amber, take Alice to the shower. Bring her a towel, something to wear. Put her clothes in the wash. Then bring her to my study, so we can have our interview. Yes, Ms Sophie. Right away, Ms Sophie. Bobby? Yeah? You're in charge of putting everything away. When you're done, get back to that essay, please. Yes, Mom. Thank you. Try and keep that dry. I'll see you in a few minutes. Okay, come with me. Don't you just love this beautiful how, how... Hey, Bobby. Hi, Amber. Do you need help? Amber focus. Get Alice ready. Next time. Is he your boyfriend? Oh, I wouldn't stand a chance. I'm not really his type. What type is that? The non junkie kind. Hey. I'm mad at you. Don't be. Okay. Hey, Alice, Now you have to remember to be completely honest. If you don't want to say something, don't worry, Sophie won't mind. But just make sure you don't lie to her. Another one of her rules. Have a seat. Have a little drink, for your nerves. That's what I thought. What brought you here? Amber let me in. What are the events that led you to end up here? I fell, and haven't been able to get back up. Everyone here has fallen. Some of us get up and keep going. Others keep tripping and falling right back down again. I turned this home into a shelter to help everyone stand. Do you need help? Can you talk about it? Do you want to talk about it? Are you willing to accept the help that is here for you? Because if not, then there is no point to this, and there is the door. This is not a house of lingering, but a house of getting better. Everyone here has accepted they need help and are trying. Are you willing to try? I don't abide by regulations. But I do have rules that have to be followed. Do you understand? Yes. We don't have deep pockets funding us. I raise money. Good people and local shops donate to keep us going. Before I let you stay, I need to know... Yes! Are you in danger of hurting yourself? Are you in danger of hurting others? No. Is someone looking to hurt you? No. Are you wanted by the authorities? No. Alice is not your real name, is it? What's your real name? I like Alice. Okay, I understand. You can be Alice here. And that's as formal as it's going to get. Is there anything to fill out? No, this is a place to find peace, and help you find yourself. Is that what you seek? More than anything. No one here is to be judged. But we have to be honest with ourselves in order to heal. She can stay. See, I knew she'd let her stay. Sophie's an angel. Maude, I want you to take Alice to the kitchen. Can you ask Andrew to give Alice something to eat? And then you can all give her the rundown of the rules. - There's more rules? - I will do as you ask. Andrew, we've talked about you doing- your magic in my study! I know. But I wanted to give the grand entrance to the new lady. I am the Amazing Andrew. It's a pleasure to meet you, Alice. Come. Let's eat. Don't mind them. They're just curious. How many people live here? At a time? No more than a dozen, max. But it varies. Here you go. Eat up while it's still warm. Can I get a spoon, please? Of course. Spoons are my specialty. They really are. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay. Here's the deal, Alice. Sophie's house is modeled after the temporary shelters. Over there, you get a maximum of 72 hours before you have to leave. Here, we get 82 hours. As of today, we got two days left. What happens then? Well, we have to leave the premises for 48 hours. No exception. It's a hard rule. If we don't, we're considered residents, and we lose this safe haven. Where do you go? Wherever the day takes us. Can you come back? Well, of course, after two days, during which time Sophie cleans the place, and looks for paraphernalia and other things that shouldn't be here. Like your flask. You little snitch. Shhhh. It's such a drag, but we have to do this 'cause the city already dinged her once for having too many people in here. Is giving shelter to people illegal? No, it's not. They act like it's the end of the world. All the storage bins are taken. You'll have to bring all your stuff with you. I don't have anything. That's good, the less attachments you have, the easier it is to survive. As long as you don't fight, or you don't do drugs on the premises, the doors will remain open. Here's the rest of the rules. How long have you been coming back? A year and a half. 14 Months. A year and a half. Why do you keep coming back? It's hard out there. I left nine months ago, and next thing I know I'm using, and my boyfriend's pimping me out again. She has a soft spot for that loser. You'll meet him. He's always coming around. He knows you're here? He used to come with me. We both got clean at one point. I'm staying clean as long as I'm here. Don't you have parents you can go home to? They kicked me out. I can't blame them. I was stealing from them, and always promising to clean up, only to come home high the next day. I'm gonna go for a smoke break. I told you, I'm not interested. It's not about being interested or not. You need to take the deal. Do you know how many people depend on this house? What you do is commendable, but the bank isn't interested in your humanitarian endeavors. They just want their money. You are months behind in your payments. You don't have many options left. I know, I know. I know everything you've done for us, Georgina. And it's very much appreciated, but there's got to be something more. We're barely charging you interest as it is. Donations are slow to come in this time. If you were to register the Cottonwood as a proper shelter, you would get government help. I can't do that. You know that. I don't agree with some of their regulations. Humm, We can do a reverse mortgage. Don't I have to be dead for that? No, it's not like that. I can promise you that we at the World Bank have your best interest at heart. Let me show you. We're gonna have to take an assessment of the property. And once we assess the property, then we can see how much is this property actually worth. Blue is not at his post? He must be doing his rounds. Sophie knows what she's talking about. She's a been there, done that type of person. She has a scary look to her, but she's all heart. Rumors say she was quite the beauty when she was my age. Whenever she walked out of the house, it was like someone dropped ice cream on the sidewalk. All the neighborhood boys would swarm around her like ants. Sophie? She could have had her pick up any boy she wanted. Unfortunately she was into bad boys. Sounds familiar. Johnny Hagan was his name. He went to jail for shooting a guy. And then he was stabbed to death two weeks in, leaving her pregnant with Bobby. Amber, you should go inside. - Speak of the devil himself. - What's wrong? Amber's ex. L'il shawty! What do you want? Nothing with you Grand-Maude, so mind your business. Hey, watch yourself. You should all mind your business. I'm here to talk to my baby girl. Ex, ex baby girl. Come on. You're my bae. You promised to be my forevah. My princess... get in da car. You're scoopable as they getz. Like before, just yous and me, baby girl. Leave her alone. Baby. It's me. You know I wont hurt you. I still got mad love for you. Do you still love me? I love you. Tell me you love me too. I d... That's enough, Clarence. That's not my name, bitch. But it was before you dropped your snotty face out of school. This is between me and Amber. This is my home. Whatever business you bring goes through me. If it isn't Ms Badass Sophie. You need to get going. Is that right? Blue! Ms Soph' says you gotta go, Mr. Yo. So go. When you get bored at playing house, come find me. You better watch yourself, old hag. Or you're gonna get yourself in a shit load of trouble. Creep! Okay, everyone. Let's get back in. Yes. I do. I've wanted you since I was 14. ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Da da da da ♪ I got the cake. We're gonna be together forever and ever. And I got the flowers. And ever. I do, Mr. Yo. I do. But wait. What about Bobby? Is Amber okay? He's her kryptonite. She's not as strong as she used to be. She's been trying to stay clean, but she's been failing at it. Last time she went with him was on an eight day binger. Are you okay? Maybe we should get Sophie. No, it's okay. She just needs to process it. What's going on? That's Huevo. He's one of our broken vets. Why do you call him 'egg'? Well, he does anything for eggs. Scrambled, fried, poached, boiled. I've even seen him eat raw eggs. Now sometimes he yells out of the blue, mostly at night. Lucky us. Great. She isn't always gonna be there to cradle him. Sophie has a way of talking with him, getting to him. What's going on in that brain of yours, child? I have to leave. To go where? With Mr. Yo? Why do you care so much for him? He was there for me when I was at my lowest. He was the reason you were at your lowest. And he'll drag you right back down again. I can help him. Isn't that a rule? Help those in need? You can only help those who want to be helped. He needs me. Yes, to make him money. It's not love. It's a business arrangement. It's so hard. They say you are what you are. Maybe, maybe I'm just a junkie. You are so much more than that. You're young. You're bright. You have a great future ahead of you, as long as you set your mind to it. What happened with finishing high school? Your dreams of being a nurse? I don't belong in school. You don't belong here. School is a way out. Why don't I ask Bobby to bring the application again? Will you fill it out this time? Don't let it become one big problem. Keep it small. It's a 'mini prob'. 'Mini prob.' Come here. Miss Sophie, can I please come in? Yes, of course. I'm not having a very good day today. It's okay, hon, It's okay. Thank you. You're a really good gardener. Of all the chores, gardening is my favorite. This is a really big place. Used to belong to a lady by the name of Cottonwood. Sophie was her nurse for 20 years. She inherited the place when she died. She could have made a bundle of cash if she sold it. And she turned it into a shelter? It's more of a Transition place. It's a temporary shelter for people to get a leg up. No one likes their own situation. Getting out as soon as possible is most ideal. See that guy, Tom? He's a grad with a BA. His drinking got him in here. Now he goes to AA meetings regularly, and job interviews. He's gonna get out. Some of us are a little complacent. Hey, Tom. Are you going for an interview? Yeah. Today's life insurance. Yeah! It's door to door, but I'll take it. You need help with that tie? I do. I totally do. That's good. Thank you. I'm looking forward to it. I think it's gonna go well. Okay, good luck. Good luck. - Good luck, Tom. Thanks guys. - Good luck, Tom. Oops, sorry. Vroom vroom. Vroom vroom. Hey guys, Sophie's having issues with payments. It takes a lot of moolah to run a place like this. She had to take a loan out on the house. Can't she file as a shelter? No. This is a home, not a business. Which the other shelters are. Businesses have the right to refuse services to anyone they want. Some places claim to help the homeless, but they're more concerned with their quotas and agendas. Well, I had a friend... Maude. Lucia was her name. Her life was in a rut, and she decided to go to Chicago to start over. As a Cali girl, she didn't even have a coat. So I bought her one with the little money that I had. Nothing worked for her. She ended up becoming depressed, developed a habit. Didn't have any money, started living on the streets. One shelter one night refused her entry because she was gay. What did she do? It was in the news, they found her dead one night on a cold night. If only she had a real coat. It wasn't your fault. No, I know. It's just, Sophie would never let that happen. This place is special. She's made it a home. And no one can tell her what she can or cannot do. Keep it. Isn't there something we can do? I've said let's rob a bank before, but everyone looks at me like that. Yeah, we're not doing that. I will figure everything out. Now, come on. Let's go. We're going inside. Let's get creative. We have a full day ahead of us. First we have art therapy, and then we have group talk. And then we have therapy therapy. Come on, Maude. No. I'm just gonna be here for a few minutes. Tell Sophie I'll be in soon. I'll stay with you. No. I wanna be alone. I'm fine. You know the rules, Maude. I can't leave you alone right now. Okay, fine. I'll wander, okay. You let me know when you're ready to go. Okay. Who's that? My son. Is he waving hello or goodbye? Who is this? Her son. Tell me about him. His name is Derek, and he's 27. But he'll always be my baby boy. Why is he waving? I'll never forget the first time Harold and I took a trip without him. He was with his grandparents. And this is him waving to us as we left for the airport. I was all smiles. But I was crying inside. Where is he now? On a mission. Is he a spy? He's a Marine. He was deployed two years ago. And he's still there? Maybe we can talk about him later? What do we have here? The 'emptiness of life'. Oh, and the 'human condition'. Here you can see my purple scrubs. And you can see my name tag. It says Nurse Amber. You see? You see it, right? Yeah. And then I have three of these little tear drops, because this guy didn't make it. In jail they say that every tear drop you have is somebody... You know what I'm saying? Okay. We'll talk. Hey, Blue. Have you met Alice? She's brand new here. Oh yeah, the other day. I'm security. Yeah, Blue keeps us safe, 'cause he is the toughest mean machine man out here, right Blue? Hells yeah. I'm gonna go on my rounds. Okay, thank you. His real name is Sam. He used to be an all pro tackle for the Springfield Colts. Wears that blue jersey everywhere. Name Blue just kind of stuck. He took a pretty serious blow to the head. It left him a little Blue actually lives here. Sophie's his full time caregiver. Sophie wants to know if you are going to attend the fourth night party. I can move some of my meetings around. Yeah, I can probably make it. What's that about? It's a sweet way to send us off. It's our last night together, before we'll have to leave the house. House rul... Isn't this a pretty picture? Is that new blood I see? Leave us alone. We're calling the police. Here I am, trying to welcome this little bitch into the neighborhood. You're acting like you don't know me? That's cold blooded Grand-Maud. Screw o... You're gonna talk back like that to your employer? I don't work for you anymore. You're wrong, little girl. You still haven't paid off your debt. Why don't you two butt heads get the hell outta here and leave these fine people alone? Why don't you come on up? I have a little something here for you. Hey! Teddy! Don't you call me that, you old hag. You know that's not my name. You're right, it isn't. It's Theodore, Theodore Bullock. T-bullshit is more like it. Why don't you boys leave? Go home. Your mothers are probably worried sick. I'm looking at my Mamacita right now. I'm here for Amber. Are they here for you, Amber? I don't know what they're doing here. Oh, come on. That just simply hurts my feelings. You're not the emotional type. Just leave. There's nothing here for you. Amber, go inside. I'm not afraid... Amber, get inside now. Yeah, you'll listen to that old hag. She'll keep you safe, along with Mr. Big Security Man over here. Get on your way, now! You can't keep her forever. We'll come back for you. And you're a little older than we take, but come and find me. We'll find something for you to do. Let's go, dirt bags. Let's go. Don't let the door hit you where the good Lord splits you, bitches. What's their deal? They belong to a gang. They called themselves the Five X's. I noticed the X burns on parts of their bodies. Every time one of them does something they consider remarkable, they get branded with an X. You don't become a full member of the gang until you have five X's. What do they want with Amber? Oh, they go way back with Amber. They recruited her in high school. Yo and her were sweethearts. They used to keep her high, and forced her to work the streets. Pieces of crap even filmed her. Hey, Georgina. - Hey. How are things going? - Good, good. Oh. Georgina, you better be bringing me some good news. Well, I have done all the paperwork. So I hope, you know, we can make something work. I have the assess... Hm, can we go inside where is a bit more private? Yes, of course. Please step into my office. I'll see you a little bit. Bobby, can you please tell Andrew to bring us some tea? And when you see Steph, tell her to start with Alice. Okay. - Thank you, hun. How bad is it? It's very bad. Missed more than a couple payments. How much is owed? 20,000. We applied for a grant. We should hear back any day now. That'll bring us up to date and keep us afloat. In the meantime, we'll continue to reach out to our regular benefactors. Hey, where's Amber? I brought her GED application. She just needs a few minutes alone. She'll join us shortly. What are you studying? I'm finishing my Gen Ed. Thinking about getting into pre-law, 'cause it's the best way to help around here. Maybe business. That sounds boooring, Bobby, I see you as an artist. What we need is to be more money savvy, not have another painting on the wall. Those are good degrees, Derek. They'll get your work. You know you just called me Derek. I did? I'm sorry. It's okay. Do you want to talk about him? He was my son. He studied philosophy. He ended up in the military. Is he no longer with us? What do you mean? Why would you say that? I'm sorry for assuming. It's just that you said was, in the past tense. Well, you're wrong. He's not. Ladies and gentleman! Steph is here. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks. Steph is our therapist. Sophie wanted you to be the first to see her. Do I have to? It's a Sophie rule. I have no say? You don't have to say anything. What if I don't feel like it? Nobody does. But we all do. We all do. We all do. We have a mandatory 45 minutes. We could talk, or continue to stare at each other and let the clock run out. What am I supposed to say? Anything you want. What's the point of talking about anything? Well, it's something, if it's important to you. Talking helps. Be it with a stranger, a pet, even a puppet. It doesn't help me understand you better. It helps you understand yourself. I know exactly how I'm feeling all the time. And what is that? Scared, anxious, apprehensive. About what? Those emotions are triggered by fear. What scares you? Is it being here in the shelter? Are you afraid of someone? Of a loss that you won't accept? Whom have you lost? I saw a grief counselor, but it was pointless. Because my son is still alive. How did therapy go? Bobby tells me you got upset at him over a comment he made about your son. I know you're not a drunk. And I know you haven't been on the streets long. Your teeth are very white. What are you hiding from? What are you so afraid of that you'd rather take your chances out on the street than facing it? I just need... to be away, from everything, from everyone I know. You want a clean slate. What? I mean a vacay to reorganize your thoughts. One hell of a way you chose to do it. Going on a cruise is more my thing. But, you are here now. And I'm responsible for you. Are you coming back after the reset? Where else would I go? The truth? Not here, and not out there. I mean our society is broken. We're overworked, overstressed, living paycheck to paycheck, with little savings, and hugely in debt. We're over medicated, fatigued, dying of heart disease and cancer. We've confused keeping up with the Jones' with living, and are dying with regret of all the things we wish we had done. Why would anyone want to go back to that? The truth, the truth is in here. You have to be brave to face what's in here. Find yourself, find your balance in this world of ours, and live the best life you can. This here is limbo. Don't get comfortable. Or you'll get trapped, like many of these other lost souls. At the end of every reset, I hope I never see anyone come back. And I continue to be disappointed. I've had too many losses. I need a win. ♫ Running through life searching for what's right There you are. We've been looking all over for you. Are you ready for a big adventure? ♫ It may just be you and I ♫ The way I see the light within your eyes ♫ And sound is turned off inside my mind Amber. Bobby brought the GED application. You wanna fill it out tomorrow before you leave? Yeah! I hear it's somebody's special day. Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue. Is it Blue's birthday? No, this is the cake we started as a last night tradition. We take turns with the names. ♫ The clock is ticking down and we're living it up right now I am the Amazing Andrew. Look after the place, Blue. Bye, guys. Be safe. She's coming. Hey, guys. Where Amber? She's in the garden waiting for you. We'll get her later, when we go to the store. Okay, I'll remind her. Stay of trouble. There you are. You had me worried for a bit. I'm sorry. I just didn't want the others to see me off. Why? I was afraid that if I left with them, I don't know if I would've come back. I wanna try this nurse thing, Ms Sophie. I look good in purple. Well, they'll be picking you up on the way to the store. Hey, Soph'. The freaking bank's on the phone. I'm on my way. Hey, Amber. I got your GED application. Are you gonna help me fill it out? You bet. Come on up. Let's work on it. Sure. It's just two pages. So we can get this done really quick. Okay, yeah. Easy. She hasn't come out yet. Let's get outta here. We'll come back later. Hey, Andy. Where you going? The park's this way. Y'all go on ahead. I'll catch up with you, okay? Don't you worry. I won't miss my curtain call. You just go out, and already thinking about the bottle? Don't judge me, Egg Man. He'll be back. Let's just go. We're going to the park first, to see Huevo's brother, Bubba. And then later on tonight, we're going to crash at his store. It's a convenience store. He let's us stay on the roof. I sleep in the car. I don't do heights. Hey, I have a joke. What came first, the chicken or the huevo? It's funny. Bubba! Hermano. Hey, Jen. Hi, Maude. Hi, Huevo. Hey, Jen. Will the roof be available tonight? Of course. Just head on up whenever you want. I'm here until three. You're an angel, Bubba. This is Alice. I can make some dogs and fresh juice if you all want some. You're a real peach. I'll be back shortly, Bubba. I wanna do some restock for a bit, earn a bit of money. Espera, I got something for you. Buy, Huevo. Bye. Anyone have a small white balloon that I can use? You, young lady with the fuzzy head. Come here. For my first trick, I'm gonna turn this balloon into an... An egg! Oh! That was good, right? Thank you, young lady. For you, some flowers. Thank you very much. Off you go. There you go. Now, for my next trick. The children are really enjoying his tricks. You're allowed to clap. He's actually quite incredible with an audience. You'd never know it, but he used to have a show in Vegas. That’s big, what happened? Ready on the count of 3 His wife was his assistant and something happened between them. 1,2,3, blow. After that, he was drinking and missing performances. Very good. A little wet, but that's okay! He ended up bottoming out here, in this very park one night four years ago. If he can find a way to beat the alcohol, maybe he can start over again. Well, not unless he can get an agent that will get him a new liver as part of his contract. Is it that bad? He only drinks at Sophie's, he doesn't even eat any food anymore. I am going to need a volunteer. Oh, that's my cue. Yes, young lady with the... new one, yes aaah, here we go. Another volunteer. Thank you very much. What's your name? Maude. Maude, and we've never met before, have we? Okay, let's sta... What is that? What? Oh my God! - What? Oh my God! - What? Did you see that? You ready for this? Now we're gonna put this egg in your forehead. Tada! Alice. Gracias. This looks wonderful. Try it. Did you make this? Yeah. Yum. Has Huevo gotten help for his PTSD? He had an episode the other night. Si. Military shrink gave him some pills, and told him to shake it off. At home, he never wants to talk about what happened. We were okay with that because he said he, he did some horrible things out there. Latinos don't easily accept mental illness. And that's why most of the family stays away, scared of him. So we help Senorita Sophie with whatever we can. No other shelter will take him. He seems so harmless. He's a sweet man, but he can't hold down a steady job. He kind of loses it sometimes. It ranges from verbal abuse to physical violence. He spent many nights in a cell. Huevo. Did I miss the show? It's gonna be amazing. Are you ready? Abby, I think you're gonna like this one. You ready? Haa! A tie dyed wind sock. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Okay. This is what we're gonna do. Are you ready? Close your eyes. I'm gonna disappear. And open your eyes. Where'd he go? Where did he go? And I'm back. Wow! Did you see that, Abby? Thank you. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If you have it in your heart to spare a few dollars or coins or something, I would really appreciate it. Thank you very much, guys. Thank you very much. Enjoy the rest of your day. We're getting together this weekend at Mom's. You're welcome to come too, Alice. Huevo's friends are my friends. Is your mom a good cook? She makes the best gorditas in the world. You like chili rellenos? You are very good. Maybe you could do private events. Thank you, my dear. But sadly, I'm an even more Amazing Drunk. I can't get a decent booking anywhere. You goof. The only booking you're gonna get is for ripping off liquor stores. Amazing Andrew uses his hands for shoplifting. Anyways. Did you see what he did? It looked like he actually put an egg through my head. What does Andy do with the eggs after the show? I have taken a magician's oath. I assure you no eggs have been harmed during the prestige. Actually it's silicone and it's in his back pocket. You see? It's not bad, guys. I got enough for a nice Cabernet here. Any takers? All right, listen. I'm gonna go get myself a couple two buck chucks. You guys go get whatever you want, and I'll meet you back at the roof. Why don't you just join us for lunch? I mean, there's plenty here for everyone. And there'll still be enough for wine afterwards. I made enough for pizza. And ruin a beautiful bottle of wine with food? Why are you doing this to yourself? Madam, please don't dare judge me until you have walked a mile in my wingtips. You know what? You are so hell bent on ending your life as soon as possible. Are you all right? Look at the two of us, huh sweetheart? We both suck them back to dull the pain. We both drink to forget. I tell you what, my good friend. Why don't you wait up for me? And we can be terminal together too! Oh, you're Amazing all right. You're an amazing A-hole. What is that about? Last year Maude found out she got a inoperable tumor in her stomach. The pain must be terrible. Sophie gives her medicines, but out here. Maude, I'm so sorry. You know what? Just ignore what that piece of shit said. I don't need you people feeling sorry for me. Hell, if I wanted that, I'd call my kids. Is there something I can do? Yeah, you know what you can do? You can do something for me. You can put some food in Andy's body, so he doesn't starve himself to death. Humm! ♪ Don't act like you love me ♪ ♪ Don't act like you care ♪ Do you have any family? Three kids. My husband is deceased. Do they know? Of course they know. You have family. What are you doing out here? Cause I don't want to be a burden to them. Didn't they care? Of course they care, from a distance. They all want to look after me, as long as I'm not with them. Johnny's offered me a live-in nurse at his expense. Julie said she'll pay my hospital bills when the time comes. And Nora, she said she'll fly out for a few weeks. What do you want? No one's ever asked me that. You know what I don't want? I don't wanna be in a nursing home, or even a hospital with tubes stuck in me just waiting to die. I wanna be with people I enjoy, people who are alone, but not lonely. At Cottonwood, I'm a part of something there. I'm doing something. I'm not just dying. I'm part of a cause. I know it's not much. My social security check helps with the groceries. And Sophie, she's helped me find a program that gets my medicine at a lower cost. You contribute to the shelter? Then you don't need to be out here. No, actually I do. It all adds up, medicine, rent. Some of us have jobs, and we can't even make ends meet. What about you? What's your story about? I wanna be alone, but not lonely. You have a boy. Does he play a part in this? My son went missing in action for months. And then we got a notice that he was dead. That can't be, because I don't feel it, you know? And a mother would know if her son was gone. But the letter. Letters can be wrong, sent by accident. It can't be true. Married? Business trip. He's accepted it. He thinks I'm crazy for wanting to hold on. You're not. Sometimes you gotta lie to yourself to keep going. Be warned. The truth is going to come out. Prepare yourself. Greet it with a smile, and not with fear. ♪ And I bleed ♪ ♪ You ♪ ♪ And I need... ♪ ♪ You ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ I bleed you ♪ Hey, Andy. We gotta get Amber. Get up, you bum! There's no bum here. Just people who haven't found the right way in life yet. We gotta get going. Come on! Hey, guys. We're all ready here. Gonna head to the store, get it all ready for tonight. See you there? Bye, Huevo. We're moving in. What about the big guy? I brought an old friend for him. Okay. Exactly - Oh yeah, I think that looks right. And that's your autograph. Oh, yes! - Yes. So I'm signing right here, blah blah blah. Yeah... okay. Don't forget this. Have you been accepted to the US Military before? No. Are you sure? I might have to double check. Okay. - Hm, no I don't see... - Say No to that. Oh Yeah! Maybe one here. And one more autograph there. Okay nice. You can't be here. Hey, big man. I'm here for Amber. No visitors allowed. I'm not visiting, just picking her up. You can't be here. Says who? Ms Sophie, you dumb ass. I don't see her. So I guess it doesn't matter what she thinks. You're gonna get in b... big trouble. Is that right? You're a little slow there aren't you, biggie? I'm security. That was sick. Let me get this on Snap. That's it? There you go! Oh my gosh, thank you so much Bobby, I couldn’t have done it with you. All signed, sealed and ready to deliver. Umm hmm, oh and just in time too the group should be here to pick me up. Yeah. Hey, well what are friends for right Yeah. Let's send it off first thing in the morning. Okay. She's mine! Oh! Shhh. I told you I'd be back for you. Stay put. - BLUE! Not so tough without the big guy huh! What did you do to him? Same thing we'll do to you if you get in our way. Bobby! What did you do to my son? You can tend to him as soon as we get Amber. I'm not going anywhere with you! I'm not leaving without my number one earner. I don't do that anymore. Cut that out. You owe me. And with that pretty face, you'll pay your debt in no time. You're coming with us, otherwise the old hag is paying off your debt, okay? Okay. I'll go. Just please don't hurt her. Go Amber, go. Hey! Oh! Blue, stop! Blue stop it! Let's go! Come on. Let's go! Hey, Amber. Woo! Oh no! No! Let's go! Alice, go check on Sophie. And for my next trick, I'm gonna spit up a little blood, and then pass out for a little while. You're okay here. Help is coming. Get in the car! Whoo! Let's go. Derrick! How's he doing? He'll be fine. He's just resting now. He's doing fairly well. What he needs is some good, healthy food. He's really malnourished. He'll recover from the beating, but the damage he's doing with the alcohol might be irreversible. Thank you. Nurse Palmer, is it? You haven't told us anything we didn't know already. Can I ask how long he's been drinking like this? He's been drinking night and day ever since we've known him. A year and a half? As someone who's been there, if he wants some help, I'd be more than happy to take him to a meeting. Thanks. We'll try. It's a real long shot. I'll bring him out too shortly. Okay. This is the second time in my life I've felt powerless. It really humbles you. He'll pull through. This is what happens when you get caught up in this life. I lost my husband and my oldest son to addiction. I'll be damned if I lose my baby boy because of some junkies. Who is waiting for you, Alice? Go back to them before you lose them too. My name is Kathy. It's a pleasure to meet you, Kathy. My son was killed in a mission in the Middle East. My denial hurt my marriage and my career. I lost many friends. I didn't cash the death gratuity, because taking the money meant accepting that he was truly gone. And I didn't wanna exist in a world without him in it. Had it not been for Bobby, I'd be where you are right now. I had to save him from that life. Instead, he saved me. When I saw him bloodied on the floor like that, I snapped. In a way, he saved me too. Does it ever get easier? The pain Comes in waves. Not easier. But the waves are less frequent. Have you seen Kathy. Heard from her? Go home. Your husband needs you. Thank you. Thank you for giving me a win. You know, Andrew, you really should come see us sometime. It's not that bad, I promise. They got an open bar? Thank you. She cares. Hey Andrew, you look like a mess. Next time you should wear a helmet. How you doing, Sophie? I've seen better days. Where's Alice? I thought she was with you. She was called away. Good for her. I'm sorry about Blue. I hate myself for not being there. There's nothing you could have done. No! If I see them again, I kill them. Excuse me. I got it. I got it. I got it. Look at me. Let the authorities deal with it. There will be no more killing. Let's hold hands and let's give a minute to Blue. And they're doing a CT scan and we should hear the results soon. Ms Sophie? Leslie! - It's good to see you. - You look terrific. You guys know each other? Oh, we go way back. Your boy, Andrew here is very talented. Ooh. What did he do? There were a couple of kids waiting for X-rays. And even as banged up as he is, he managed to do some very impressive magic tricks to keep their mind off it. It was kind wonderful. She means Amazing. If you're up for an encore performance, there's a little girl who came in. She had a seizure. I think she's a bit frightened. A couple magic tricks might help take her mind off things for a while. Go, do it. Be Amazing for that little girl. Apres toi, mademoiselle. Merci, monsieur. Who wants some coffee? Oh, I do. I'll buy, if you go get it. That's a fair trade. Come with me, Huevo. We're just gonna take a little bit longer. We wanna catch the show of the Amazing Andrew. Hi. Drop it. Drop it. Hehehe. Come on. Hehehe. Kathy! You're back! Somebody, quickly. We got a live one here. We need a medic. Nurse! Female, 20's, lacerations on her face. I know. Derek is dead. He's here. He'll always be here. I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused you. I know you miss him as much as I do. Can you ever forgive me? There's nothing to forgive. We have each other again, That's all that matters. Can we do this? Can we move on? Moving on doesn't mean forgetting. It means opening your heart to accept with love the memories we've made. Together, we can do it. I love you. Hey, you're awake. I'm lucky I have a thick skull. Don't mind if I do. - Thank you. Nurse Palmer let us see Andy with the kids in the children's ward. The kids were so excited, they forgot about everything. And this little boy, he didn't have any hair and he couldn't even sit up. His eyes lit up when Andy pulled a coin out of his ear. And the nurse said that it was the first time he smiled since his last chemo treatment. I am so proud of you, Andrew. And I think nurse Palmer kinda of likes Andy too. Don't kid yourself. She's just trying to get me to an AA meeting. Miss Leslie Palmer was as big a mess as you are right now. And she turned her life around. You should listen to her. She got herself out? It takes somebody to care a little bit. It's enough to just get you back on the right track. Ms Sophie. Can I see you a minute? Yeah, yes of course. I'll be right back. What is it Leslie? We had a young girl come in, and she gave you her name and Cottonwood as her contact information. Is it Amber? Is she here? That is the name she gave us, yeah. How is she? Can I see her? She's still being assessed. She's stable for now. We gave her a sedative. What is it, Leslie? Her wounds were self inflicted. What did she do to herself? She gouged the skin off her face with her fingernails. How? Why? Has she said anything? She hasn't spoken to anybody. We're running a tox screen. We think drugs were involved. Thank you. Hi. I'm so happy you're alive. The cops went to the X's hang out, and when they didn't find you there we were expecting the worst. I did it, Ms Sophie. I didn't hesitate, Ms Sophie. I did it. I wouldn't be pretty no more. They couldn't sell me no more. I made up my mind. I was gonna go to school and get me a GED. I was no good to them. They told me that I was useless now, and that I'm worthless. And then they threw me out of the car, because I'm garbage. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. You're going to be okay. I got you now. Mini Prob. Hoo. This is such a cute check. I can't wait to see Georgina's face when I give it to her. We wanted to put the money to good use. It was an appropriate way to honor Derek's memory. Thank you. A toast. Cottonwood welcomes the motley crew of society. We're safe. It's our home. May her doors never close. Salud! - Salud. Hum, hm! It's time. Work hard, okay? I will. You too. - You got this. Argh! Come here! I'm proud of you, kid. Thanks so much. I'm proud of you too. Never thought I'd be sad leaving this place. You're not gonna miss anything! You're gonna be very busy studying them law books. Yes mom. Oh, I'm so proud of you. I'm going to miss you so much. I'm going to miss you too. Hopefully you're gonna be so busy running this place to even miss me. Your help is immensely appreciated. Good luck. I'm gonna make you guys proud. Drive safe. Let's do it. New rule! Call your mom often. Yes, Mom. Bye. You won't even know I was gone. Okay. Bye, guys! Bye, honey. - Bye. Bye. Bye, honey. Love you. Okay. Let's go. All done! Now tell me about Virginia. I've never been to Arlington cemetery. ♫ Flowers bloom, and life still goes on ♫ Memories haunt me cause you're gone ♫ Sitting on the couch wrapped up in your arms ♫ Driving down the highway, back seat of your car ♫ Just doin nothing but sippin on you ♫ I don't care what we do ♫ I wake myself up from this daydream ♫ Wake myself up from this daydream ♫ I'm sittin here alone ♫ Sittin here alone ♫ The taste of you reminds me ♫ The taste of you reminds me ♫ And it takes me back home ♫ It takes me back home ♫ Sittin on the couch wrapped up in your arms ♫ Drivin down the highway, back seat of your car ♫ Just doin nothin but sippin on you ♫ I don't care what we do ♫ I wake myself up from this daydream ♫ Wake myself up from this daydream ♫ I'm sittin here alone ♫ Sittin here alone ♫ The taste of you reminds me ♫ Taste of you reminds me ♫ And it takes me back home ♫ And it takes me back home ♫ And it takes me back home ♫ And it takes me back... ♫ Home.
