- I've spent my life in the pursuit of carnal knowledge. I've been with more women than I can remember. I've acted on every impulse of lust I've ever known. I lie, I cheat, I steal. I imagine killing people I hate. There's no hope for me. I can't be forgiven, so I continue. I'm here today to tell you that all of this is sin, all of this is human, and all of this is forgivable. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. This isn't some, you know, table trick. This isn't some method to get you to buy books, or tapes, or to get you to life a single penny from your pocket, this is God's gift to you. And you can take it, you can leave it, you can pretend he never said it, but you can't change it. You can't change it. And that's the beauty of it. - You've been listening to Sermon by the Springs, with Reverend Theodore Wendell, of the community church... - Good? - Leward, Pennsylvania. - Oh Ted, I'm so proud of you. It was wonderful. - Thank you, you know how much your approval means to me. - Lovely, thank you, lets get this served. Alright, hello, hello. I come to feed the multitudes. - Oh, sweetie, that's chicken. Not fish. - Yes, Emily, my rock, without whom I'd be forced to survive on a steady diet of my foot. Alright, thank you for laughing, it's very nice. Could you raise your glasses for a toast? To my beautiful wife, 20 years, happy anniversary. - Thank you. 20 years! - Thank you all for coming, very sweet. - And the food's coming right up. We promise. - Excuse me. Listen, Ted, I spoke to the powers that be at the radio station... - Right. - And, you're close. - How close? - Well the television affiliate wants to send someone out to the church to, you know, see how you come across to the public. - Good, how about tomorrow? - I thought you'd say that. Hey come on you kids, lets eat! - How are you? - Good, thanks. - Good. Hi, how are you? - Hey, good. - Hi, sweetie. - Hey listen, Emily. Yeah? - They wanna send somebody out from the network to watch me preach tomorrow. - Oh honey, that is so wonderful. - Yeah, I don't think we should say anything, in case they don't show up. - I'm so proud of you. Thank you. - What have you got here? - I'm such a pig. Thank you. - Do you see that guy watching us over there? He's been there for quite awhile. Do you recognize him? - No, I'll go introduce myself, how's that? Hello, good picnic. Heavenly, Ted. Yeah, good. You're sure I'm not imposing? - You're not imposing at all, don't worry about it. - Thanks. - Honey, look what I found. - Hi. Luck McElroy, lost sheep. - Oh hi, I'm Emily, Ted's wife. - Luke's new to town, looks like he could use a meal, so. - Oh, well great, we've got plenty of food. - You see, it's really starting to come down, it's a good thing I put up the tent. Hey, why don't we go for a burger? - Sure. Sure, I'll get you one. Lets get in out of the rain, come on. - April showers bring May flowers. Come on guys, the rain stopped. Lets play ball! - So this guy, and this girl, they drive up to lover's lane, and the guy makes his move, and the girl says, "Hey listen, "I gotta be honest with you, I'm a hooker." And the guy says, "Okay." And they agree to $25. - 25, must be an old joke. - So they go in the back, and they engage in a little carnal activity, a little hoop de doo, and they finish up, as it were, and the guy says, "Hey listen, I gotta "be honest with you too, I'm a cab driver, "it's gonna cost you 25 bucks to get back into the city." That's a good joke. That's completely appropriate. - Hey Ted! - Yes? Oh no, I'm called to the manly field of honor. - Alright, you boys go out and play, while we women do all the work. - Reverend, when can we expect our men to put away childish things, like softball? - When they become men. Oh Luke, think fast. Look at that, come on, lets go, join me. Sure. - Hey, you wanna join us for dinner? I'm putting the rest of the cake in here. - Thanks so much. - Honey, set a place for three tonight, I've invited Luke to dinner, okay? Okay guys, two out, top of the ninth, no pressure on the batter. No pressure. How do you spell choke? I got it! Cheers, Luke! - I got it. Oh yeah! Oh, sweet! - Did you see that catch? It was great. - Switch it up. - How'd you get that? - I'm on it. - Lucky jump. - Nice pitching, Ted. - You did a lucky jump, we're down a run, you're up, lets go. Did you see that? Good job, that was great. Lets go Lukey-Lukey. Lets see some of that south Georgia magic, baby. - Put it in there. Go, go! I'm going for it! Hands to God. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Safe. - Hold on. Hold up. - Nice hit, buddy. - Bring me home, Ted, bring me home. - I'll get you home, baby. - Come on Ted! - Lets go Ted! Run, run, run, run, run! - Ted, watch it, Ted. - Okay, come on. Come on baby. - Nice job! - Yeah! - I've never had this before, what was it called again? - Paella. - Paella. - Paella. - Well I'll say Emily, you're quite the cook. - Thank you. Listen, I was thinking, maybe we should hold off on the fundraising for tomorrow's service. You know, do it next week, 'cause we don't want the network to get the wrong idea about your message. - Sure, sure. - Oh, we're just talking shop. - No worries. - So, how about coffee, and leftover anniversary cake? - Terrific. - Yeah, I'll have some. - One of the ladies said that you made the cake yourself. - Yes, I did. - It was delicious. - Thank you. - You ever been married, Luke? - No. - Let me tell you, it's the best, it's terrific. It's better to be married than to burn with passion. - Maybe. But I like passion, Ted. - Where are you from? - No place special. - Sounds like West Virginia, or Georgia... - It sounds like he doesn't wanna talk about it, sweetie. - It's nothing to talk about, really. Thank you. Didn't have anything to keep me where I was, so I left. - Sounds to me like you're looking for something. - More like waiting for something to find me. - Or someone. - Maybe. - Well consider yourself found, Emily, what would you say if we hired Luke on as a handy man? - Do we need a handy man? - Honey, do we need a handy man? The church is falling apart, the car won't start, where are you staying? - Little motel, far side of town. - We've got that extra room down in the church basement. - Yeah, I don't wanna put anyone out... - That's great, it's settled. Emily will get you settled. I've gotta go work on my sermon for tomorrow, alright? - Alright. Wow, nice place. You don't seem as enthusiastic about me being here as your husband. - Well, Ted is a man who leads by faith, and I'm a wife who follows by instinct. - What do your instincts say about me? - Same thing they say about anyone who's reluctant to talk about themselves. - I'm hiding something? I think we're all hiding something, Emily. That's what makes religion work. - Your room's over here. It's a little bare. - And big. No it's fine, it's very nice. - You're gonna have to use the bathroom up in the church, there's a shower there too, and this quilt is for if you get cold. Well. Guess you're all set. - Yeah, this will be very comfortable. - I'll see you in the morning. - Alright. Emily? Goodnight. - Some problems? - Oh, as a matter of fact there are. I'm just a little concerned about Luke's reluctance to talk about himself. - I think it's refreshing to have somebody not willing to air out their dirty laundry. - Ted, I mean, we don't know anything about him. - Well honey, what's to know? I mean, he needs a place to stay, and we're not gonna leave him in the crummy motel. I don't see the problem. - I just think it's irresponsible for us to open ourselves up to someone we don't even know, a complete stranger. You know, what are people gonna think? - Well who cares what people think? This church is not about to turn its back on people in need, and since when did you start worrying about idle gossip? - About the same time you stopped asking me for my opinion. What's that supposed to mean? - You invited him to stay here without asking me what I thought about it, Ted. I'm your partner in this ministry, but I am your wife first. - Well maybe it's time we redefine exactly what that means. - You can plow the back 40 when you're done. - Yeah, Ted mentioned she was having some trouble. - I didn't realize it was a she. - That's all I work on. - I figure that cream was a safe bet. - That's how I take it. - So, where'd you learn how to fix cars? - Actually, I never fixed a car. Been in a few though. - I mean did you used to be a mechanic? - I used to be a lot of things. Wanna hop on in there and see if she turns over? ♫ Mine is the glory ♫ Brave and conquering son ♫ And this is the victory ♫ Now o'er death has won - Very nice, thanks. Thanks. Romans 1:17, the just shall live by faith. Amen. - Did you know there are a lot of people that claim to be just? You tell us. - Waging war in the name of the Lord. Preaching gospel. Influencing men. Bragging, deceiving. It's just in our nature. It's just in our nature, God expects it. God has filled us with covetousness. Sexual immorality. Maliciousness, violence. Pride, greed, envy, all for a reason. What's the reason? - So that we have a choice to be just, right? Yeah but, but, but, God will not make that choice for you. Amen? Amen. - Amen. Thank you so much, that was so inspiring. - Hello. - Hi. - I'm Lori Fusaro, WKRY-TV. That's quite a sermon, Reverend. - Well thank you very much, I have my days. - Well lets hope you've got plenty more like that in you. - Does that mean I passed? You got it. - We'll be in touch with Dick, first thing Monday morning. - Okay, thanks for coming. - That is so wonderful, honey. - Mrs. Wendell, we have a big problem. - What is it? - It's the bus driver, he got sick and threw up, I don't think he should be driving the children. - How are you feeling? - Not so good. - Okay, why don't you go inside, and lie down? Tracy, get the bus loaded and ready to go, I'll find someone else to drive. - Luke can drive, Luke you can drive the bus right? - Yeah, sure. - Ted, we barely know him. - It's alright, Tracy will be with him. - Ted. - Step right up kids. - So have you ever driven a bus before? - Will it make you feel any better if I say yes? - Alright, well Tracy knows the route, so if you run into any problems, just pull over, call me, here's my cell phone, it's speed dial number one. Alright kids. Come on kids. Hang on. Everything that you made. Oh we could do a bake sale. - Oh that's a good idea. There's gotta be more creative ways to raise money than just church raffles, and car washes, and bake sales. - Well, of course there is, but we're good Christian women. Oh Cindy... - Oh I certainly hope Tracy remembers that. Oh, it looks like the congregation is about to swell by one. - That man doesn't strike me as the type looking for a home. - I can't say George was either when I first met him. - Nonsense. George was always a good man. - Oh Sarah, please. George was a hell raiser from the time he hit puberty. It's only been a few years since he stopped drinking. - Well if you ask me, I think it's a mistake to let a man into your home unless you know something about him. - Oh Sarah... What do we know about any man, huh? Reverend, oh Reverend. - Ah, yes... - We were just... - Don't get sharp. - You were just what? Honey, we were just concerned, that's all. - A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit, right? We will all know him, ladies, by his fruit. Now what have we come up with for the summer fundraising plan, anything? - Well, we're working on it. - I'll be right there. Hello? - I just wanted to let you know that we made it back without incident. There was that one little girl we ran over, but she cleaned up pretty good. We made it back safe. - I had faith that you would. - Your faith is comforting, Emily. I can see why you're so loved by the congregation. And Ted. Gotta go. ♫ Holy ♫ Holy - Hey, it's open. Hey. - Hi. - Hey, come on in. I was just reading. Wasn't expecting company. - I just came by to see if you wanted to join us for dinner. - It's alright, I'm decent. Yeah, dinner would be great, thank you. - Oh good. What were you reading? - Shakespeare, you read it much? - Oh no, not since high school. - I read him a lot. It's pretty funny. - Isn't Hamlet a tragedy? - Is it? I only understand every other word, so maybe I'm missing some of the tragic parts. - Why do I get the feeling you don't read a lot of Shakespeare? - Guilty as charged. You don't trust me, do you? What is it you think I'm hiding? - I don't know. - What are you hiding? - Nothing. My life is what you see. - Well all I see is, is a... Your situation. Oh sweetie. - Hey, everything okay? - Yes, I was just asking Luke if he wanted to join us for dinner. - Yeah, that's a good idea, give Luke a chance to tell us what he wants here out of life. And I promise, no religion, until dessert. Emily! It's over! - It's over, it's over, it's over. You having a nightmare? - Yeah, I was. - Okay. - But I'm fine now. - Alright. - Goodnight. - Nope. No, I don't like it. - Excuse me, but Ted has never had a television show before. Playing to a camera's different than playing to a microphone, and he's gonna need time to get comfortable with the format. - What about advertising? I mean it's a weak time slot, how's anybody gonna know he's there? - We'll run ads on our religious programs. That's a start. - We suggest that he keeps his radio show until he can cross over that audience base. - Mrs. Wendell, I've seen your husband preach, I have no doubt, he'll be national before the year's out. What do you say, Reverend? - Can Ted speak the word of God the way he hears it, no editing? - That's what we're paying him for. - Well. I guess we have a deal to save souls. - That's great. - Praise the Lord. - Praise the Lord. - Don't you ever answer for me again. - Ted, I was just putting them on notice about letting you use your own words. - Made me look incompetent. - That is not true. I was defen... Why are you so upset? - Because it was humiliating, and I don't like being made to look like an idiot by my own wife. - I'm sorry. - What's to know, he's cute, he's single, and he's living in a church. - He's staying here, not living. - Well whatever, any man who would be comfortable staying in a church oughta be investigated. I agree, he should be investigated. - Oh Sarah, please, you'd have the goats at the petting zoo investigated. - What do you think, Emily? - I think I'm gonna take the finished quilts to the hospital while it's still chilly at night. Does it help? - I didn't expect to see you here. - Does it help? It does for me. - What exactly does it do? - It comforts me, makes me feel less alone, like I'm part of something that makes sense when nothing else seems to. Like I'm loved. - Isn't that what a husband's supposed to do? - I guess. When the marriage is blessed by the church. - Well it seems to me that people have desires with and without the church. It's human nature to love, and wanna be loved. Did you know God before you knew love? - I knew a different kind of love. Was it bad? - No, I don't think any love is bad, it just wasn't fulfilling. It didn't enrich my life the way God's love has. - Well maybe that different kind of love was just the wrong one. Maybe the love you found in here is meant to be different. Maybe it's meant to fulfill your soul. Maybe that type of feeling to your husband. Or lover. - Oh yes. - He maketh me lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me besides the still waters. He restores my soul. He leadeth me down the paths of righteousness, for his name's sake. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen. And we're clear. - That was as good a first show as I've ever seen. - Really, it wasn't odd, the ending with the 23rd Psalm didn't seem too long? - No, no, it's fine. - It was wonderful, Ted. - Inspirational, really. - Sorry that we have to tape the show in the middle of the night, it's just that my studios are tied up. - No, no, that's fine. - Well okay, I'm sorry I'm gonna have to leave you, I have a very early breakfast meeting tomorrow. - Sure, hopefully this will be the first of many more, thank you very much. - I hope so too, Reverend. Thank you. - Thank you. - Good night, Lori. - See you tomorrow. - Good morning. - Hey. How you doing? What are you doing up so early? - I woke up early wondering how your show went, and I couldn't get back to sleep. How'd it go? - I gotta tell ya, working for the camera was so difficult, I mean I spent the majority of the night trying to get it, but then it just, it finally clicked, and I got it, and I aced it. - That is so wonderful. - Yeah, yeah, I really think I answered God's call in a very big way today. - I'm so happy for you. - Thank you baby. Thank you. - Kids, slow down. Hey, go find your father. - Isn't this yours, Emily? - Oh yes, it is. Thank you. - So how do you suppose it got there? - Oh I must have lost it last night when I was at prayer. - Oh, that must've been some pretty intense praying. - Oh, I have my moments. Excuse me, I have to let Ted know it's time to start. - Make sure you get that clasp fixed. - Oh I will, thank you. - Get over here right now. - So, did he tell you how it went, Emily? - Yes, he said it went well. - Well, he wowed them, big time. Alright, lets not go overboard. - Lets not get modest Ted, it's not in character. Good thing we have you to keep him grounded, Emily. - My rock. - Now you get this man in bed, as soon as possible. What? I mean to sleep, he had a long night last night. - It's alright, I knew what you meant. Mrs. Wendell... - Thank you, Reverend. It was a wonderful service. - Thank you so much for coming. We'll see you next Sunday. Have a good night. Wonderful, just wonderful, he was amazing. - Wait, someone's here. - No one's here. Ted's at the studio. He's not gonna be back for hours. Hey, relax. - I know. - Alright. - Okay. - No one knows we're here. Just a minute! - What do I do? Luke, what do I do, what do I do? - Don't worry. - Sara suspects something, I know it. I know it. - Well get in the closet then. - What? - Get in there, go on. Go. Yeah, just a minute. - Oh, did I wake you? - No, I was just reading. - Can I come in? - Can you come in? - Well yeah. You're allowed visitors aren't you? I mean, just because you're staying down here doesn't mean you're a priest or anything? - No, no. I'm not a priest, no. - Well what's the problem? I'm just not sure if Ted and Emily would be comfortable with me having... Entertaining a woman down here. - Well Ted's a man, I'm sure he'd understand. Emily would be down here herself if she weren't married. - Now, that's how rumors get started. - There's not a straighter woman on the planet than Emily, I... I just meant I'm not the only one who's noticed how she looks at you. - You hungry? - Like a lion. - Why don't we continue this conversation somewhere else, huh? - Hi. How were the ratings? - A little disappointing. I mean they were good, but not good enough to consider a move yet. - Oh Ted, well it was just your first show, and I'm sure they'll get better. And you know what, I talked to them about doubling our promotional spots, and I also think that we need to refocus on our radio base so that... You must be tired. Can I get you something to eat? - No, I had take out. Where's Luke? - Luke... I don't know, I think he was going out with Tracy Duggins. - Ah, Tracy Duggins. That's interesting. There's a woman who'd be well served by marriage. - Marriage? - Honey, she's got a bullseye on the boy's back. By the way he looks at her, I'd suggest he's not about to start running any time soon. - You may be right. - It's been a long day, I'm gonna take a shower and turn in. - We just walked. For I don't know how long. I lost all track of time. You know there wasn't a moment when we weren't like completely enraptured with each other. I felt like Julia Roberts in one of those romantic movies, you know. - Did he try anything? - Of course not. He was a perfect gentleman. - Oh, too bad. Hey, sorry I'm late. - He did kiss me when I dropped him off. - Oh, how was that? - He kisses exactly like he looks. - Don't tell me you guys are still going on about that Luke guy. - Sounds like Tracy's got the hook in, and she's just giving him a little line to play with. - I'm not doing anything of the kind. Luke asked me out. - Oh, where was that? - After church. - Oh, if you ask me that sounds like bad news waiting to happen. - Nobody asked you, Sarah. - I've seen his kind before. He's like the rain after a long drought, I mean it feels good until it doesn't go away. Then eventually it starts to erode everything it touches. What do you think, Emily? - I've always liked the rain, Sarah. I like how it feels, especially after a long drought. And I never really worry about how long it's gonna last. Yee-hoo, baby. - Luke. - I am so sorry about the other night. I had no idea she was coming over. - Well she's quite smitten with you. - Oh come on, she's a kid. - She's a woman, and she's single. - Yeah, and you're a woman, and you're married. - Oh God, Luke. - So? - Hey, get off me. I'm glad to see that moral integrity isn't a quality you find attractive. - Emily. There's nothing immoral about this to me. I love you. And I don't have to look any further than that. - Well I do. I mean this is much more complicated for me than just stealing time to be with you. My life is built on a foundation of truth, and morality. I can't just ignore who I am for a few moments of pleasure, and not feel like there's a price to pay for that. - And why does there have to be a price to pay for honoring your feelings? - Because I'm married. I made a vow before God to honor my husband, and our relationship. - Well it's my understanding that God has a way of forgiving these sort of things, you know. - Hey, don't be glib with my beliefs. The decision to come here and be with you is mine. Whatever happens because of that decision, I accept and take full responsibility for. But I will not be a hypocrite and adjust my thinking, just to ease my guilt. - All I'm saying is people can pick the wrong people to be with. You change, you grow. But it's okay to make mistakes. And you don't have to spend eternity paying for 'em. - Yes, you do. - Yes, she just left. The house, I imagine. No, I haven't had the chance yet. 'Cause it hasn't come up yet. Is that a threat? Yeah, yeah, I know what I said, okay. I know the deal, just relax, and hold up your end. I'll get the money. - 85. - Ladies. Your dedication is inspiring, and your accounting skills are beyond reproach. - We're happy to be of service, Reverend. - And just how much bounty have we been blessed with today? - Looks to be about $18,000. - Oh. Cha-ching. Have you seen Emily? - Not since the service ended. Now, would you like us to deposit this in the night drop at the bank? - No, no, no, that's fine, I'll lock it up, and Emily can deposit it in the morning. Why don't you go enjoy what's left of Easter? - I don't know if I've ever been moved quite as much by one of your sermons as I was tonight, Reverend. - You're so sweet, Alice. Do you know, it's your faith that moves the spirit in me. Goodnight. - Nice break. Hey, looking good. Like you could do any better. - Hey you found it. - Luke, why'd you invite me here? This is not the kind of place I feel very comfortable in. - I'm in trouble, Emily. You were right about me. I never talked about my past, 'cause I was hiding it. Now I've done some things that have caused a lot of people a lot of pain. And I ran from it. But now it's found me. - Okay, alright, well we'll just have to reason with whoever's... - Listen to me. I need $50,000, or the people I owe money to are gonna kill me. - What? What kind of people would kill you for money? - It doesn't matter who they are. It matters that I get them the money, now are you gonna help me or not? - How could I help you? I don't even understand what we're talking about. - My life. And yours. - Okay, here you go, Mr. Luke. - Thank you darling. No problem. - Would you put it on my tab? Sure thing. - I need you to loan me $50,000. - Luke. I don't have that kind of money. I don't have any money. - You don't have any money? - No. Ted takes care of all our finances. I don't have a need for money. - I'll bet I can give you a need. Say some time next week, two men knock on your door and explain to Ted how his wife's been having an affair with an escaped convict from Georgia? - Why were you in prison? - Does it make our affair worse? My sins were more violent. I killed, I raped, stole, fill in the blank with whatever you need to motivate yourself. Hey. - Why are you acting like this? - Maybe this is how I am? You ever think about that? Don't you go searching for the moral high ground, because you feel you've been deceived. I mean we all have our dark little secrets we keep buried away. That's right. I know all about yours. 50 grand, Emily. You know where I'll be. Forgive me father, for I have sinned. - Emily. - You remember when we first met? - Yeah, of course I do. You remember what you asked me? - Can you show me the way out of here? One way. I smiled as you pointed up to heaven. I didn't even know that you were a patient. - You never asked me why I tried to kill myself. - Of course not, that's between you and God. - And all this time, Ted, didn't you ever worry that I might try it again? - No. I can't say I did. - I have a confession to make. - Well I'm not a priest, Emily. - I want a baby. - Yes, so do I, but the Lord hasn't blessed us yet. - Ted, I'm running out of time. - No, you're running out of faith. - This isn't about my faith. This is... This is about your ambition. All you wanna do is promote the image of Ted Wendell, and our marriage is nothing but a way to enhance that image. - While I respect your passion, I hope it's still well focused with all this ministry has riding on it. - It doesn't look like 50 grand could fit in that little thing. - It's a confession. - A confession? Why are you giving it to me? - I'm giving the same one to Ted. It explains what I've done, and what I've been hiding. - Is the truth in that letter, Emily? - Yes, it is. - Our secrets rendezvous, while your husband was busy building a ministry on your virtue? - Yes. - Does it tell the truth, about this? You didn't know I knew, did you? How did you... - I know all about your suicide attempt, Emily. I know it's how you met Ted, why you found God, and hell I even know something Teddy boy doesn't know. I know why you did it. I know about the rape. And those sort of things just seem to happen in a family. And I even know about the baby. It's tragic really. If people had have known the pain you suffered, they would've understood your actions. In fact, I even know something that you don't know, Emily. - Oh please, just stop. - Oh I don't think you want me to stop now. I mean we've come this far, haven't we? I know how much like to finish what you started. - Luke. - That's not even my name. I took it from my favorite Paul Newman movie. Actually I was named after my father. Well I mean my grandfather. Well I mean both, see I didn't really know the man, 'cause I was adopted, but I was wondering maybe you could tell me about him. Mom. - No! No! - Emily! Emily! - No! - Emily, come on now! Hey, hey. It's kind of ironic, isn't it? How we repeat the sins of our fathers? Now, no one has to know about me, and what we did. But you need to give me that money, Emily. Do you understand me? Do you understand me, Emily? Okay, good. Come on now, hey. If you run to Ted and confess, he might forgive you. He might even understand. But I'm not sure if anyone else will. 'Cause see, I'll talk, and Ted's TV days will be over before they even started. And your own congregation will probably have a lot of trouble looking you both in the eyes. But, your life is worth $50,000, isn't it? - How will I know that you'll leave? - You're gonna have to trust me, mom. - I'll need some time. - You're the chief financial officer of the church. One trip to the bank is all you're gonna need. Cash, Emily. - So, George comes home. Sees the mess in the kitchen. Takes one look at me holding the tenderizing mallet, and he says, "Why don't we go out for dinner tonight?" He's a pistol, but I gotta admit he does have his moments. What's the matter, Em? - Nothing. What do you mean? - I mean look at you. You're my best friend, you're the nicest woman I know, but even Mother Theresa would have told me to shut up an hour ago. - I'm... I'm just a little tired, I think. - You look troubled. Is it something you wanna talk over, or should I just continue with the George and Cindy show? - Have you ever committed a sin that feels unforgivable? - Did I ever tell you about George's affair with our cosmetics rep? - No. - Of course, he was still drinking at the time. He kept giving me little soaps, and perfumes. We weren't fighting, everything was fine in bed. I just figured he was like most men and didn't have the first clue about shopping for a gift. I came home from church, one Sunday morning, and I caught them in our basement. - You're kidding. - He knew I was at church. What he didn't know was that morning was daylight savings, and I forgot to turn the basement clock up an hour. - I'm sorry. That's not funny. - Oh sure it is. He looked like Elmer Fudd holding a bomb about to blow. It took me a long time to get over. I prayed a lot. It was right after that that George quit drinking and joined the church with me. But... The real reason I was able to forgive him was because of what I did. - What do you mean? - I slept with George's brother. - Well did George ever find out? - No, and I never told him. I feel horrible about it, and I still live with the fear that one day George will learn. - Well maybe if you let him know then you can let that go. - Emily. Don't tell Ted. If you truly love him, find a way to live with it. What time are you suggesting? - Lets look at next week. What do you say to a studio congregation? - Studio's too small, we can't use a studio. Well, if we got a... - Hi, honey. - Hi, you're home? - Yeah, we're just going over a few things before this week's show. - Oh, hi Dick. - Hi, yeah we're going for the early knockout. - Oh, that's great. I didn't see the car. - No, I lent it to Luke. - Luke? - Yeah, he has a date with Tracy Duggins. Hey, did you happen to make the bank deposit? - Yes, I did. - Okay. - Well, here we are. Hey, thanks for dinner tonight. Next time, it's on me, alright? - Okay. Thanks. - Alright now, bye. - Bye. What do you think you're doing? - I like the rain. - You like the rain? You know, I got news for you Emily, if you're going for a beautiful, poetic moment here, I think you missed it. That is unless, of course, you have about 50 grand in that bag there. Do you? Did you get the money? - You mean did I steal the money? - Whatever. - I wanted to have an abortion. By the time I found out I was pregnant it was already too late. - I'm not in the mood for any family history right now, alright? I don't care what you did, I'm not here to work past anything, just pay me, and get on with your pitiful life. - Have you seen your father? Our father? - I've never seen him, I never want to. - How'd you find me? - Looked you up in the Yellow Pages, alright? - How did you find me? - It doesn't matter Emily! I'm here, so deal with it. Now where's my money, Emily? Thank you. I don't suppose there's any reason why I should count it, right? I mean if you can't trust your own mother after all we've been through, you can't be trusted. - Just keep your word, and leave. - Yeah I will, sure. Don't worry. So much for a little family reunion, huh? - Let me out of the car. - Where do you wanna go? - Just let me out. - Look, I can drop you off a block... - Let me out! - Will you close the door, Emily? - Stop the car! - Emily, close the door! - Stop it! - Stop the car! - What is wrong with you, Emily? - Please just keep your word, and leave. - The guy seemed nothing but sweet, and genuine the entire time, so... Emily, hey. Where were you, you alright? - Yeah, I just... I went out for a walk, and I got wet. The rain... Mrs. Wendell. - Officer Burke. Is something wrong? - Come here, you're shivering, sit down. You've gotta be cold. - No, I'm fine. - Have you seen Mr. McElroy, recently? - Who? - Luke, he's missing. His things are gone from the apartment. When was the last time you saw him? - Sunday. Easter Sunday. Did he give you any indication he was planning to leave? - No. Did he say anything about needing money, needing help of any kind? - No. - Emily, Alice told me the church collection totaled $18,000. But the bank deposit you made was for $7,000. - It wasn't locked. - What wasn't locked? - The desk drawer that he put the money in. You didn't lock it. - Yeah, I did. - Well it wasn't locked. - Okay, maybe I didn't. - So $11,000 is missing. Do either of you know where I can find Luke McElroy? - No, he never told us where he was from. - I do. - I know how you can find him. I lent him my... Sorry, our car, and he went on a date with Tracy Duggins, who lives on North Maple Drive. - North Maple. Well, I think it's pretty obvious Luke stole the money, and maybe your car. If you hear from Luke, or if either of you remember anything else, I need to know right away. - Hey officer, could I get a word with you for a second? Sure. - Thank you. Goodnight. I have to work, go to bed. Emily, what in God's name are you doing? - I'm doing nothing in the name of God. - Honey, where are your clothes? - I took them off. Yes, I can see that. Come here, what are you doing? Jesus. - Can you see me, Ted? - Yes, I can see you, Emily, lets go. - What do you see? - I see my wife, now what are you trying to prove, lets go. - We're all naked in the eyes of God, aren't we, Ted? Isn't this what you always said, we're all naked in the eyes of God. - Yeah, that's what I said. - Then why aren't we? Why do we hide ourselves - Okay, Emily. - With clothes. - Emily, you're not well, okay. - Adam and Eve didn't hide, they were naked, weren't they? - Yes they were. - They were naked. - Yes they were, yes they were. - Till they sinned. And then they covered themselves from God, to hide. To hide who they were, what they did. But he saw them. He knew because we're all naked in the eyes of God, aren't we Ted, we're all naked in the eyes of God. - That's right, we're all naked in the eyes of God. - Right, right, yes? - Lets go, okay Emily, we've gotta go inside now. Okay? It's very cold, lets go. - You didn't know I had a child, did you? - What? - No, of course you didn't, 'cause I never told you. When I was 14, a boy. Fathered by my father. I gave him up for adoption. I never saw him. They didn't want you to see them then, because you might change your mind, and not give him up. But they didn't have to worry about that with me, because I didn't wanna see him. I didn't wanna see him, I just wanted him out. I wanted to forget. I... But I couldn't forget. I couldn't forget him. I couldn't forget who he was, or where he came from. That's when I tried to kill myself. Then I met you at the hospital, remember? - How could you keep something like that from me? - It wasn't hard. You just... You just wake up every morning, and get dressed, so no one can see you, and then you forget it all again. It worked for 24 years. Until he came along. - Are you saying Luke is your son? - Luke is my son. And... - And what? And what, Emily? - Luke is my lover. Ted, I'm sorry. I didn't know. - I'm sorry? Do you have any idea what you have done to me? Do you have any idea what you've done to this church? Do you have any idea what you've done to this church? - No one will know, Ted! - No, no one will know, what about Luke? - No, no! No, please. - Get off. - No, I gave him $50,000. I told him to go away. And you believed him. - He swore he would, yes. What else could I do? - You can have faith in me, is what you can do. You can have faith in this church, is what you can do, you can have faith in this ministry is what you can do. Emily. - Good morning. - Where am I? - You're at Heward Civic Hospital. - Where's my husband? - He was here most of the night. He said to give him a call when you woke up. How you feeling, Mrs. Wendell? - What am I doing here? - Your vitals were a little erratic so the paramedics brought you in. Everything's fine now. We ran some blood tests, and congratulations. It looks like you're pregnant. I hope that's good news. - Does my husband know? - Don't you wanna be the one to tell him? - Can I leave? - I don't see why not. Why don't you get dressed, and I'll see what I can do about having you discharged. - I'm sorry for putting you through all this. I can only pray that some day I'll be forgiven for my sins, and that you'll forgive me too. - Your place in heaven is secured, Emily, this ministry, however, is over. - No, your ministry's strong enough to survive this. - It's over, it's over, Emily. - The leader of men must be beyond reproach. Everything God has given me has been betrayed. - It was me, people will see that. - Well who's gonna believe I knew nothing about it? Who's gonna trust a man whose own wife wouldn't trust with her past. - I don't care what people think. I don't care, we can move somewhere, and start over. This time with a family. I'm gonna have a baby. Ted. Say something. - I'm announcing I'm stepping down as a minister. You should seek God's comfort here this morning. Honey. ♫ Holy ♫ Holy ♫ Holy ♫ Lord God almighty ♫ Early in the morning ♫ Our song shall rise to thee ♫ Holy ♫ Holy ♫ Holy ♫ Merciful and mighty ♫ God in three persons ♫ Blessed trinity - I'm drawn to the book of Luke, chapter 12, verse two. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known. Hypocrisy, that's what Jesus is talking about. There is nothing covered that will not be revealed. Wow, that's a scary thought. You know, as I look around at your faces, so many of whom I've known for some time, I can't help but wonder what you might think I hide. Like, what does he spend his money on? Why does he wanna put himself on television to do what he can do right here in front of us? Testify. - It's fear that asks these questions. We're afraid of the unknown. We're afraid of walking into a dark alley. We're afraid of eating new things. We're afraid to die, and I know a lot of you will say, you now, not me preacher, not me. I'm not afraid to die, I've confessed my sins before Jesus, I'm going to heaven. Fear makes people lie. Fear makes people cheat. Fear makes us do the things that no one would think we could possibly do. Fear makes hypocrites of us all. Jesus knew fear. The son of God who had nails driven through his hands, and feet, and hung on the cross, waiting days to die, knew fear. He warns us to be afraid. And I say unto my friends, be not afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do, fear him, who after he has killed, has the power to cast into hell. Yes, amen. Amen? Amen. - Can you show me the way out of here? One way. - Let these scars always remind you, there's no crashing God's party. But there's no comfort in getting to heaven, unless you're invited. ♫ All your prayers ♫ With joy surround you ♫ Perfect every place you'll lay ♫ Lord and angels sing around you ♫ Angels above us ♫ Know his name - Anniversary party, far side of the covered bridge. Wait for Ted. Starry Eve Motel. - Yeah? What are you doing here? - You're not my son. - I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I am your son. - My son had a birthmark. The shape of a crescent moon, underneath his left arm. - That's right, got that removed a year ago. I hated that thing. - Ow! - My son didn't have a birthmark, now who are you? - Will you relax? - Who are you, what have you done? What are you doing here, what are you doing? - You don't know what happened. Ted hired me! - What? - Yeah, that's right. He found me in Atlantic City a few months ago, hustling women at a casino. Wealthy wives looking for a good time, while their husbands were gambling. I'd just gotten out of prison, just trying to get on my feet again. - You are a liar. - I'm not lying to you, Emily. It's true. It was all a set up. Ted said that you had cheated on him a number of times, and he wanted proof so that he could divorce you. - You are lying. - I'm not lying to you. - Why wouldn't he just hire a private detective? - Oh how would that look? Public preacher hire someone to follow around his wife, I don't think so. That would hurt his image. No, he wanted to expose you to the congregation so they would encourage a divorce. He said all I had to do was be available for whatever you wanted. - No, I don't believe this. - He gave me the location of the park, time to be there, and $5,000 worth of encouragement. - No. How could he have known that I would've seen you that day? That I would allow you to stay at the church? - He called every move that you made. That's why I believed him. Once we were sleeping together he would create reasons to go to the TV studio, at night. Leaving us time to spend alone. Then one night after you left Ted came in, said he wanted me to blackmail you. - Oh that is ridiculous. - He said that the congregation might forgive an affair, but embezzling money from the church for your lover? Well they'd run you out of town. He offered me 25 grand. I didn't wanna do it... - Then why did you? - 'Cause I was on parole. Ted's friendly with the Magistrate from Atlantic City. Said if I didn't go along with it, he'd have my parole revoked. And I guess that's easy to justify when I'm sleeping with a woman for money. - How'd you know about my son? - Ted told me. Emily, I didn't wanna do it, I swear. But I thought the worst thing that would happen is he would divorce you. He'd go on with his life, and I would find you, I would tell you about... - You know what, that is not true. Nobody, nobody knew about that adoption. - How would I have known about it, Emily? But Ted told me everything. - No, Ted would never ever do that to me. - Listen, Emily. - He never would! - Listen to me, he doesn't love you! I mean whatever love he had for you was gone years ago. In fact, I think that if he weren't a preacher, he would've taken a contract out to have you killed. - Emily. - He brought it back. - He brought it back? That's great, that's a miracle. - Hi, Emily. You feeling better? - Yes, thank you. - We can finish up later, Amanda, thank you. - Okay, call me when you're ready. Excuse me. - What are you gonna finish up later? - There's an accusing tone to your voice, Emily, have I don't something to earn your distrust? - No you haven't. There's $50,000 in there. I took $39,000 from the church bank account. - When did he bring it back? - When you were giving your sermon. He also said that you brought him here from Atlantic City. - That doesn't surprise me. And what do you believe? - I believe you. - Yeah, I had Dick check up on him. He's done this before to other ministries. You're not the first woman to fall prey to his act. - Well why would he bring the money back then? - Cold feet. He can't go to prison for just seducing another man's wife, but you can for grand larceny. Come here, come here. It's alright. I've prayed for us. This man, who has invaded our life, and sought to bring down this church, and this ministry, he's been revealed as the criminal he is, and he'll pay for his sins. The return of this money is our insurance against public scandal. - Well what about us, I mean... How can you trust me after everything that I've done? - Because I love you. I always have. The Lord spoke to me about our child. This is a new beginning for us. What? - Nothing, I'm just afraid that one day you'll wonder if this child's really yours. - I know it's mine. And I pray it won't be our last. Hey there, buddy. Ted. - Hey man, what a lovely spot you've got. - You ordered? - No, I don't, you're late by the way. - Am I? - Yeah. - You know, I can't believe I'm here. My end was supposed to be over. - It's over when I say it's over. How did she find you? - You bring my end? - Look it, I'm doing a live broadcast of my church this week, alright? - Hey did you bring... I asked you a question. - Just let me finish, alright? I'm doing a live broadcast from my church this week. This has to be resolved by then. - What do you mean resolved? - It's means the job's not finished. - Look, I agreed to come onto your wife, and blackmail her, that is it. - No, no. - Give me my money. - I'm out of here, give me my 25 G's. - It all changed when you gave that money back to Emily. Now the only way to get that money back clean is to get rid of her. What do you mean get rid of her? - Just, if you wanna be practical about this, I'll let you keep the whole 50 grand. It's a very simple solution to this whole situation. - I'm listening. - Emily's gonna kill herself, so to speak. All you gotta do is make sure it looks like a suicide. - You want me to kill your wife? - I want you to make sure she doesn't wake up. During my live broadcast, Emily will be lying in bed, dying of an overdose of sleeping pills. - How do you know she's gonna overdose? - Because I'll be making the tea. Thank you, keep the change. Thanks there buddy, thanks a lot. - I would estimate your due date, on or around December 16th. Now, this is for pre-natal vitamins, and this is a list of foods high in folic acid. - Well thank you. - Emily, I have to ask you a sensitive question. It's in the interest of your baby's health, and yours. - Oh sure, what is it? - Who's the father? - I can't believe you asked me that. Ted is the father. - Ted had a vasectomy two years ago. I assumed you knew. - That can't be true. He would've told me. - I'm sorry, Emily. You have my word, no one else will know. - Hey, I made you a little breakfast. I know it's been a little crazy around here lately. But I just want you to know that the Lord has blessed me with you, and with this ministry, okay? - Has the Lord blessed you with the child inside me? We would like to talk about... - Look it, I don't care what you do with the cameras, so long as I can move around, that's it. - You can move, anywhere you want on the stage, but we can't light the rest of the church effectively. - Now hold on, Ted has to be able to use... - Okay Dick can you handle this, I gotta go check on Emily, she was feeling kind of blue this morning, I'll be right back, alright? - Oh no, what about Emily, she could come in here. - It's over, she's leaving me. - What no, what? - She told me last night. - Ted, the show, you can't. - There's a plan, Amanda, we have to have faith all is going to go according to the plan, alright? - Yeah. God's plan. That's right, God's plan. Thank you very much. Lower, lower, that's good, there. - Emily? Emily, you awake? I'm talking about a battle here people. A no holds barred, scrap for your eternal soul. Right? You think the Devil fights fair? No! - Temptation is his weapon of choice. And no man can resist temptation, I don't care who you are, I don't care what pulpit you're standing in, I don't care what direction you face when you pray. If the Devil wants you to fall, you're gonna fall. God doesn't turn his back on his children that fall. The Devil knocks you down, it's your choice, you get back up, you go at it again. We are all in a battle here, people. And it's not over till God says it's over. No man will know the day, but that day's coming, that day is Judgment Day. That day when the gloves come off, and God says stop fighting children, please stop fighting, it's over. ♫ Every blessing - But until that day gets here folks, I'm gonna fight the fight. I'm gonna stand up, I'm gonna look the Devil square in the eye, and I'm gonna say you take your best shot. You take your best shot, 'cause I got the power of Christ behind me, and I'm getting right back up. - Emily? Emily? - I'm so glad it's you. - Did you drink the tea? - No matter what he hits me with, I'm getting back up, I'm sticking my nose in his face, and I'm saying Devil is that the best you got? ♫ God lets sun shine ♫ Oh - Emily? - Emily, what's wrong? - How could you do it, Ted? - You'll have to forgive my wife, she's been under a little stress lately. We actually have some fantastic news for you... - How could you do it? - Anyway, we are thrilled to announced we're gonna have a baby. - Are you thrilled, Ted? Is that why you tried to kill me? - If you'll excuse me, I need to take my wife home and put her to bed. - No. You put poison in my cup of tea to look like I killed myself. You don't want the baby inside me. - Emily, listen to what you're saying. My friends, I apologize for this tragic display. Emily has been... She's been on the verge of a breakdown for some time. She has a history of suicide, which the scars on her wrist will attest to. - No. No, he's lying to you. He tried to kill me. - Emily, you need help. Do you hear what you're saying? This is all in your mind. - No, don't believe him, please. Don't believe him. Emily's gonna kill herself, so to speak. All you gotta do is make sure it looks like a suicide. You want me to kill your wife? I want you to make sure she doesn't wake up. - And that's the gospel according to Ted. - Sit down. - You don't wanna do this, Ted. - Sit down! Sit down, now! - Ted, please. - This is a domestic dispute. Ted, please. - I've worked my whole life for this day, and you killed it. - I loved you. I loved our ministry. - My ministry. This was my ministry. I wanted a wife, not a business partner. - You wanna kill me Ted, then go ahead. If it's God's will, then I'm ready to die. - That's very good. Take a page out of my book, play to the crowd. It's not gonna save you though. - There are worse things than dying, Ted. I realize now that my life is not a lie, you are. - I guess we both lose. - Do you know how much I loved to watch you preach? You whispered the message of hope in my ear and gave me a reason to live. You were right about one thing, Ted. There's no crashing God's party. Hands behind your back. Oh my God. May you rot in hell. Going through therapy, it's good, he'll be fine. - Excuse me, excuse me. Luke, Luke. You were supposed to leave, I told you I wouldn't tell anybody. - Yeah, well I thought about running. But something changed my mind. - What was that? - You. And our baby. - Oh, Luke. - Emily, I am not asking for anything. I know I don't have a right to, not now. Not after what I did. But you taught me something about love and faith. I might not be around to see my kid grow up, but being able to say I did the right thing, I think that'll mean something. Lets get Luke downtown. - Especially with a mother like you. Alright, lets go.
