La la la the Smurfs, la la... come and smurf along... La la la the Smurfs, la la... They'll fill your heart with song Sing a song that we can tell is full of joy so we'll feel well... Don't ever miss a beat, it really isn't hard... To do a dance with happy feet, Take a smurf as your pard. I'll destroy those damned Smurfs... ...but I'll get my revenge, and my vengeance will be terrible! La la the Smurfs la la, there's no reason for you to worry... Hello to you Smurfs! Hi there, I'm Papa Smurf... You must know the Smurfs who live happily in their village. Uneventfully, except for some things that happened in this adventure of the apprentice Smurf. What! Is that you, Clumsy Smurf? Can't you watch where you're smurfing? I'm sorry, but there was a... Smurf ahead! Well done! Because of you, I almost smurfed my smurfberry-harvester. I'm sorry, Lazy Smurf was having a nap ahead of me. Nap? How can anyone nap when you're around? Well... Hi, Greedy Smurf, I've got a present for you! For me? Really? Yeah, it's a surprise! Hi, Brainy Smurf! The life of a Smurf is not that of a Smurf... And vice versa. That wasn't funny, and I'm going to tell Papa Smurf. That's even less funny. - I'm sorry, I... - Thank you, it was obvious. I'll go see Papa Smurf about this. Wait, Brainy Smurf... I didn't mean to upset you! I don't like clumsy Smurfs! But honestly, Grouchy Smurf... Forget it. No Smurfs in the village like me anymore. There are days when I wonder what I'm doing here. Half a smurf of saltpeter... 3 grains of sienna should be enough. Now to see if the experiment smurfs. It smurfs! I've finally smurfed spontaneous germination. It will smurf the life of the village! If only I was a wizard, all the other Smurfs would like me. I know, I'll become a wizard like Papa Smurf. Now I think Papa Smurf used burnt sienna... ...and smurfic acid. I just need to heat it up, and... I wonder if it needed some water. Of course, Papa Smurf's been doing magic stuff for years. I probably just need more practice. Yoo-hoo, Papa Smurf? Where are you? Picking cherries. Oh, there you are, Papa Smurf. Hi! What do you want? I'd really like to be your assistant, Papa Smurf. I feel I have a real gift for smurfing magic and... I'm sorry, Brainy Smurf is my assistant... and he's more than enough. Well, thanks anyway. But I wanna smurf magic right now. That's lucky... Papa Smurf's out in the forest. Now's the time to smurf a look at his book of magic spells. It's locked. I know another way in. Will I be able to jump down here? Now to find the book of magic spells. Hi there, Papa Smurf! How are you? What are you smurfing in my house? Well, I came to clean your laboratory, Papa Smurf. That's a good idea. Get to work right now. Watch out! I hate smurf joggers. Come Azrael, we'll go to the pond... The scum should be perfectly nauseating by now. Meow! I'll never be able to smurf this book on my own. Hurry up, Azrael! It's Gargamel! Wait a moment... I smell good luck! Little blue luck... I smell a smurf! I'll smurf this page... It's better than nothing. I don't remember leaving my book of spells here. Me neither. I knew I smelled a rotten, revolting, vile little Smurf, Azrael. One of them has torn out a page from my book of spells. But when they try that spell, they're in for a big surprise. Mix well and smurf over a low flame. Strange... Nothing's happened. What's going on?! Smurf for your lives! Papa Smurf! What happened to you? I smurfed a magic potion from a book of spells... ...and this is what happened. What spell is that? From a book of Gargamel's. Gargamel's? I've told you never to go up there. Come along, I'll see what I can smurf. Don't you have anything else to fix this, Papa Smurf? Just a moment... We'll have to smurf something else. It's no use... None of my potions seems to work. You mean I'll smurf this way for the rest of my whole life? No, no. I'll find an anti-smurf. Go home and I'll call you. Smurfs! Can I smurf with you? I hate monsters. Nobody wants to play with me anymore. I can't wait for Papa Smurf to find a solution. I'll have to fix it myself. I'll have to tell him I haven't been able to come up with a cure. "Dear Papa Smurf... Nobody liked me before... ...and now that I'm green and ugly, it's even worse. I've gone to Gargamel's to find a cure. Love from Clumsy Smurf." He must be saved! He's gone to Gargamel's. Gargamel's? Why? For an antidote to turn him back to being a Smurf. I hate Gargamel. Perhaps we were a bit too smurf with him. Yeah. He wanted to play with us and we wouldn't let him. Let's go! If I'm not mistaken, I've caught my little spell stealer! He's so ugly! Azrael... That Smurf is not for you, he's for me. Leave the Smurf alone, Gargamel... or you'll be sorry. The Smurfs! This time I can get rid of the whole village! A tad of gum starch, a bit of glue, some plaster of Paris. You'll pay for this! Oh, it's hot. Bull's eye! He's smurfed! Gargamel can't move! I don't like Gargamel. Let's smurf! Now we need to find a spell to turn him back to normal. Ah, here it is. Hm, all the ingredients are here, except for 3 cat-whiskers. Smurfs...! I need volunteers... ...to get me 3 cat-whiskers. From Azrael's whiskers! Any volunteers? You mean some of us? So what's to be done? It's my fault all this happened, so I'll go. It's only right. Wait, we can all smurf you a hand, can't we? Right, Smurfs? Yeah! You'll help? Sure. What are friends for? Go carefully. The rest of us will start making the anti-smurf. Azrael must be out here someplace. There's one way to find out where. Olé! Smurfs? Olé! Now cut the whiskers. Here are the whiskers, Papa Smurf. Congratulations, Smurfs. You'd better smurf, Papa Smurf. Gargamel's starting to smurf up. There... it's ready to smurf. Yippee! Where can those miserable, smelly, repulsive Smurfs be hiding? Now I've got you! Azrael?! It's not fair! I'm big and strong and they're puny and weak... Why do I never win? Sorry, I did something stupid. Don't worry about it. We like you being back to normal normal. Really? Sure. Here's a surprise for you. For me? That's kind of you. So, all would be well that ends well, ...if that wicked sorcerer Gargamel wasn't seeking revenge. I've found the ideal potion... The one that will enable me to get rid of those horrible Smurfs. What did I tell you? You'll see how bad it is with Astro Smurf. My diabolical genius has once again created a marvel. My dream will soon be realised... I'm going to find those little blue monsters. Really? There, it's ready. Now I'll find where those Smurfs are hiding. Show me, wondrous ball... ...the most filthy and ugly creatures on Earth. What?! No... I mean the Smurfs. Ah, their village... But where are the Smurfs? Happy birthsmurf to you... Happy birthsmurf dear Dreamy... Happy birthsmurf to you... I don't like birthsmurf parties. No, not yet. Make a wish and blow out the candles, Dreamy Smurf. A wish? I would like to go to a star where no one has ever smurfed. I'd smurf anything in the whole wide world to be an astrosmurf. I've got it! Now I just need a light breeze. There we are, I'm flying! I'm flying! I'm flying! I've stopped flying. The dreamy Smurf came down in the last shower. Go on, laugh as much as you want... ...but I'm going to be flying in space. "Spell to make a broom fly." "Place broom on ground facing east, then say loud and clear..." "Hocus pocus abracada smurf." I hate brooms. You come back here now... Gotcha! This is it, I'm flying! I'm flying! I'm flying! I'm not flying anymore. So, you smurfed like a bird?! And he landed like an iron. Go on, laugh. I know I'll get up there. I could make a pair of wings and... No, that wouldn't smurf either, I may have been wrong to dream... ...and I'll never smurf into space. No! Look out! You really scared me then. If I didn't happen to have been passing by... ...that horrible cat could have really hurt you. A cat? Where? Where? Say, are you feeling alright? You look a bit screwy, Dreamy Smurf. I've had my birthsmurf party. I wanted to fly into space. I'm starting to believe I'll never make it. Never, never, never, never! If only I could help you. That's it! I've smurfed it! I'll build a flying machine! I'll start on it right away! Quickly, we're getting close... I can feel that this time we'll get them. Catch it! My lovely crystal ball! Give me some Smurf music! Hear ye, hear ye... Notice to the Smurfs... Astro Smurf announces the unveiling of his new flying ship. All Smurfs are invited to witness his departure. Well, what do you think, Papa Smurf? Well, it's a very smurfy flying ship, Astro Smurf... ...but how does it work? Pedal power, Papa Smurf.... Pedals turn the propeller, which lifts the ship into the air. Haste makes waste. I predict it will never work. Never ever! Quiet, Brainy Smurf...! You're a pain in the neck. Well, good luck, Astro Smurf. Keep us up to date. Goodbye! S M U R F ! Nice bit of fresh air! Yes, it's good for that. But, I tell you, I don't like fresh air. Faster, faster, faster...! I told you so. I told you so! "I told you so. I told you so!" Poor Astro Smurf... His little heart is broken. Astro Smurf's dream is to smurf in space, and he'll never be happy... ...until he realises his dream. Unhappily, there's nothing we can do to help. But it was his birthsmurf wish. And when you make a birthsmurf wish, it gets fulfilled some day. It's certainly always happened in my time. That means for 542 years, Papa Smurf. Papa Smurf, we have to do something to make his wish come true. You're right... and I have an idea that might work. You really think my ship will work now? Handy Smurf checked it over and fixed everything that was wrong. Then I can smurf off into space right now? Yes, but first you must take this special raspberry potion... ...that will give you strength on your long journey. Quick. Make the smoke clouds and start rocking the ship. Just watch where you're going, Clumsy Smurf. Where am I going? I don't have glasses, so maybe it's up to you to watch where you're going. I hate smoke! That's it... I've taken off. I'm smurfing into space. What's going on? I feel so sleepy. Must be the altitude. But it's not the right time to sleep. The propeller’s stopped. He's asleep. Get Astro Smurf out and take the machine apart. There, the machine is totally taken apart. What do we do with the pieces? Tomorrow, we take them to a secret spot ...where Astro Smurf can fulfill his dream. That's wonderful! I love little secrets... I can't wait for tomorrow! Let's see, add four grains to smurf... ...with the boiling juice of the mandrake root. Perfect! It works! If the Smurfs could only see me now. Look at them Azrael... Aren't they appetizing?! They're at our mercy. Is it much further, Papa Smurf? Not far now. Is it much further, Papa Smurf? Yes, very far! Is it much further, Papa Smurf? Yes, very far! But that's a volcano, Papa Smurf. Haven't you told us that volcanoes are terribly dangerous? And that they spit out monstrous things. That's true. But this volcano is extinct. But there's no smoke without fire, Papa Smurf. Enough chatter, we have to keep going. We have work to smurf. Push, push, push... I hate pushing! Look Azrael... Those miserable little blue vermin crossed the river here. Even their footprints are disgusting. Come on, quickly... The Smurfs can't escape us now. I said to be quick about it! It's cold. How dare you speak to your master with that tone of voice! Come in now! One of these days Azrael, I'll turn you into a bedside rug. Mummy! We all work like crazy... ...and what does Astro Smurf do the whole time? He just sleeps. Tell me, my wonderful ball... ...where are those horrible ugly creatures hidden? So they're inside the old volcano... That's not far from here. It's the perfect spot to finish off those miserable little pests. When Astro Smurf wakes up... ...he'll think he's on another planet. We need to get ready... And for that, I've smurfed a magic potion... ...that will turn us all into Swoofs. Swoofs? What's a Swoof, Papa Smurf? I'll show you. This is a Swoof. I'm Grandpa Swoof. I've stopped moving. An unknown planet! This is smurftastic! Look, there he is! He really thinks he's on another planet! We've played a good joke on him, eh? Don't you think it's a good joke, Brainy Smurf? Don't say "Smurf", say "Swoof". Oh, sorry about that, Brainy Swoof. I wonder if anyone lives on this planet. I guess that answers that. Me friend. Me come in big bird. Come and tell Grandpa Swoof, chief of all the Swoofs. Would you mind unhooking me first, so I'd be more comfortable? Where you come from? From a planet at the other end of the universe, called Earth. You friend or foe? Me friend. Big friend. We have council meeting now, to Swoof your fate. I wonder what they're going to smurf with me? Excuse me. We're almost there, Azrael. It's Gargamel! We must warn Papa Smurf. Do you think Gargamel's looking for us? Smurf, we have swoofed a decision. We have decided you are friend. So welcome to the home of the Swoofs. Thanks, Grandpa Swoof. We'll prepare a great feast to honour the Smurf. Swoof Swoof, hooray! This is really smurfy of you. Thank you.. I'm having a great time. But you'll need to rest. You'll need all your strength to return home to Smurf land. But I'll never go back to live with the Smurfs. I'd rather stay with you forever! Forever? That's not possible! Grandpa Swoof...! Where? Guards... Take Astro Smurf to the hut, and don't let him out of Swoof. Gargamel is here. Astro Smurf mustn't see him, ...or he'll know he's still on Earth. But that's only half our worries. Astro Smurf likes the planet so much, he wants to stay here forever. We have to find a solution. I know it's not far now... I can feel them. I can smell them. I'm hungry for Smurf. Those aren't Smurfs! I don't know how Gargamel found us. But he's in for a shock. The storms are violent around here. My crystal ball...! Now I can't find the Smurfs. I was just about to be successful... I almost had them... they were there.... I was already savouring my revenge. They'll pay for this! They sure will! Something tells me Papa Smurf is behind this. Him still? Get off me, you bag of fleas, or I'll turn you into a rabbit. Azrael, get off me! Faster! Now, to become a Swoof, you must prove courage and skill. Very well. What should I do? We'll spin you round blindfolded several times... Then you must Swoof the spear into the bull's-eye. But I can't see a thing. That's the degree of difficulty. I did it! I did it! Let's go to the pole test. To become a Swoof, you have to climb to the top. I've smurfed up bigger ones. The pole is covered in grease. He'll never smurf it in a million years. Or let's make it 100 years, or even 3 years. I hate greasy poles. Look at that! The Smurf made it! I can see why, Papa Smurf... the pole's not greased. It's not greased? You didn't grease it? No, I thought Greedy Smurf was supposed to do it. Ask him. No, I thought it was Grouchy Smurf. It was supposed to be Lazy Smurf. You still have to Swoof a test, Astro Smurf. I'm ready. You have to prove that you can live as a Swoof. You have to Swoof the kitchen... ...Swoof the dishes and Swoof the food for the whole tribe. And you will have to prostrate yourself before all the Swoofs you meet. And you have to kiss their feet as well. And you can only eat grass. You will not be able to sing or whistle... ...even if you're very happy. And in your spare time, you'll go to the salt mine... ...and you won't be allowed to Swoof at parties. That's how you'll live for the million years it takes to become a Swoof. On second thoughts, I think I'll smurf it back to Earth. What's happening to me? I can't keep my eyes open. It must have been those tests. The propeller’s stopped. He's asleep. We can become Smurfs again. Oh, well, we're still better as blue. And we see Smurfs as pink. Is it far to go, papa Smurf? Oh smurf it! Have I stopped? I'm back! I'm back! It was smurftastic! I've been to a star inhabited by Swoofs. Swoofs? Never heard of them. They wanted me to stay with them... ...but I felt smurfsick, so I came back. You're not thinking of going away again, are you? I really love smurfing around space... But I know I'll never be as happy as I am here. There's no place like home. Just wait till I get those vile creatures! Some day I'll get my revenge! I'll get my revenge! The Smurfs often have luck... ...though in the case of the 100th Smurf... oh dear! Heavens above, it's not possible! Oh well, it's gone out. So where's that candle? Here it is! Let's see... luck... bad luck... It's here somewhere. Bravo! Speak of the Smurf... In the 654th year, there will be an eclipse of the moon... ...one that will cause storms and great disasters... ...and misfortune that will last 100 years. The eclipse won't happen for 2 days... but misfortune is already striking the village. To avoid this smurfing curse... The Smurfs must dance the lunar dance at midnight. There must be 100 of them. There must be 100 Smurfs... We must have that many... How many do we have? Look out, Papa Smurf! Plaster Smurf makes 1. A hymn to love... Mud is composed of water and earth... So make mud and not war... and if one day... Bad luck pursues Poet Smurf. That's 2. Vanity Smurf is 4. Jokey Smurf obviously. At least this mirror can't break. Say, that gives me a smurftastic idea. I'll make a special mirror. Something's wrong. Well, I really have no luck. Hefty Smurf is six. You shouldn't do that... it could smurf your heart. And you know what Papa Smurf says. And Brainy Smurf. That's 7. Here's Handy and Grouchy and Clumsy. A last blow of the hammer, and my smurfberry-smurfer is done. I hate smurfberry-smurfers. Excuse me, Handy Smurf, I need a hammer. Gee, that sure was bad luck. I hate bad luck. Dash it! This bad luck has made me forget. Was I up to 86 or 88? At this rate, we'll never make that Dance of the Hundred Smurfs. I'll smurf my new mirror out of this unbreakable silver. Oh, I can't wait to finish it! Oh, what a terrible, nasty noise. I can't smurf with all that racket. Do you have to keep smurfing all night? I've finished smurfing with the hammer. Well, it's about time! Finally! I'd love to get to sleep. I'm going to eat a little smurf to settle my stomach. This is impossible. It's worse than the hammering. Well, I do have to polish my mirror, don't I? Not until tomorrow morning! I haven't managed to get a smurf of sleep! Me neither. What a beautiful morning! I've smurfed like a baby. I've smurfed all the smurfs including Lazy and Greedy and me. That gives us... Oh no!... We can't do the Moon Dance of the 100 Smurfs, with only 99. Hi there! We've had enough! Take your mirror and go smurf somewhere else! But... I won't be smurfing anyone out here. There we are... it's finished! Oh, more bad luck. My mirror! This mirror sure is light now. "Now light is sure mirror this." Are you real? Real you are? Impossible! I'm being followed by myself. Myself by followed being I'm. Impossible! Papa Smurf! I'm smurfly smurfed! I hit my head, sprained my knee, a stone fell on my foot... and as well as that I smurfed. I dropped my cake. I don't like bad luck. And I broke my spectacles. I can't sleep. Listen to me, this bad luck is only beginning... ...if we don't find a 100th Smurf for the lunar dance tomorrow. Papa Smurf! What is it? I was in the forest, I smurfed my mirror, and he came out. Out came he and mirrored my smurfed I. Smurf! Something has given life to the image in the mirror, so he speaks back-to-front. - Oo la la. - La la oo. Our problem is solved... Here we have our 100th Smurf. So we can smurf the dance of the 100 Smurfs. Fall in for a dance rehearsal. We've no time to lose. One, two, left, right. One and two, one and two, all together smurf to the left. One, two, left, right. Stop! It's no good! The 100th Smurf does everything back-to-front. How annoying! We found a 100th Smurf and he has two left feet. He's the only 100th smurf we have. There must be some way. It's your fault, Vanity Smurf... You always smurf things up! - Me? Not at all! - All? At not me! - Well, I think it's fine. - Fine, it's think I well. - After you... - You after... That's it, I've had enough! - Out, out, out! - Tuo, Tuo, Tuo! Enough had I've it that's! And stay out! I'll finally get some peace and quiet. That's enough of that! Let me in! Smurf me in peace! Our only chance of preventing a hundred years of bad luck... ...is to teach the 100th Smurf not to dance back-to-front. Where is he, Vanity Smurf? I don't know, Papa Smurf... He smurfed off. Bad luck's hit us again, Papa Smurf. It's going to get worse. Search the village! Search the forest! The 100th Smurf must be found. Look...! The birds and animals are leaving. They're afraid of the bad luck. You can't go against fate. That was weird... What's going on? There, Papa Smurf... we've found him! Oh, no! Look at my new mirror! That's the worst luck yet. I'm sorry, Vanity Smurf. I didn't mean to... You're talking like us! He's normal. He can talk like us. That means he can dance too. Quickly, back to the village! No more bad luck now, right, Papa Smurf? No, we've been saved. Saved been we've no. Oh, no. It can't be. Not another double!? You really don't have a sense of humour. Alright... Let the Dance of the Hundred Smurfs begin. One, two. Left, right. One, two. One, two. All together, smurf left. Smurf the Smurfs... Of course Smurfs love dance music... Especially when it's for a cause. Alright Smurfs, are you ready? We're ready, Papa Smurf. Heavens a-smurf! They've started without me. What's happening? I believe you blew a false note. Who, me? It doesn't matter... Repeat the movement... 1, 2, 3... 4! What? Again? Maybe your instrument is out of smurf. Let me try it. Smurfs well. Of course. Maybe he could play another instrument. Try that one. A cinch. Enough! The only other solution is the triangle. There's nothing we can do. Harmony Smurf can't play anything. Maybe he could conduct the orchestra, Papa Smurf. Alright, we'll give it a try. It's not fair! They're just jealous, because I smurf better. Who needs them? I'll just smurf all by myself. So there! What's that horrible noise? It sounds like a wounded dragon, or the roar of some monster. It's a Smurf! The nerve of those Smurfs, telling me I'm out of tune. They'll be sorry they smurfed me out of the orchestra. I think I can get my revenge, but I must act fast. I should have everything here to give the Smurfs a nasty surprise. I've made up my mind. I'm going back to the village, because I'm hungry. Even if they ask me to perform with them, I'll say... You'll say yes. Who are you? Have no fear, I am Aurora the good... (I hate the word...) The good fairy. Tell me your fondest wish... and I will grant it to you. Don't you want to become a mu... What? To become a music... A musician! Oh... don't you bother. The other Smurfs say I play badly. They won't any more. I'll give you this magic harmokazoo. Whoever uses it plays properly. Thank you, Mrs Fairy. Now hurry... Go and amaze your little friends. Now he'll lead me straight to the Smurf Village. I've got a new instrument. Him again?! No way! Ouch! I hate ouch! It's called a harmokazoo. Listen carefully. What are you smurfing about? What is it? What's happened? Why are you smurfing? Come on, get up. Stop joking. This is terrible. I've got to find that good fairy Aurora. Hi there! Looking for me? Gargamel! The hour of revenge has arrived! What have you done to all the Smurfs? Who? Me? Nothing at all. YOU destroyed them, playing your magic harmokazoo. Now all I have to do is get rid of you. There won't be a Smurf left on Earth. Surprise, you little river rat... I can swim too! Run all you want... I'll catch you! You can't escape me! I've got all your little friends, and you are next! Ouch, I've got a stone in my shoe. I have a stitch in my side! And a cramp in my leg! I smurfed him nicely! Must get back to the village. The horrible little monster has run off to save himself. No matter... he'll be going back to his village... And now I know the way! I go straight ahead, then I turn right... Then right again. And again. Oh, no. Oh, no! I've lost the trail to the village. To be tricked by a Smurf... It's not fair! Please, Smurfette, wake up! Get up, Hefty Smurf! Wake up, Greedy Smurf! Look at this! Yummy cake with whipped cream... It's hopeless... Nothing smurfs. All because of this smurf of a harmokazoo! But if Gargamel has the secret of the harmokazoo's spell... He'd also know how to break the spell. I'll go to Gargamel's. You lot stay here! Snares, cages, nets, poisoned leaves... I'll litter the forest with so many traps, that disgusting smurf will never escape. Wait a minute.... stop! Now to find the book of spells. Dirty little Smurf... This time I've got you! Not yet, you don't, Gargamel. Ha-ha-ha! I can't hear you. But I can see you very well! I'll bash you! I'll smash you! I'll crush you! I'll smush you! Sooner or later you'll run out of breath... ...and then you're all mine. I don't like heights... I'm losing my balance. So how about a little music, Mr Gargamel? No! I beg you... please! Stand by...! 1,2,3,4... I'll never be wicked again! I swear. Please! Well, Papa Smurf says you should never smurf a man when he's down, so... "How To Use Music Spells" Here... the harmokazoo... Oh, no, there is no known remedy! Rotten harmokazoo! You poor smurfs. There you'll lie, for evermore. I tried my best, and now there's only one thing left to do. I'm going to play a final salute in your honor. Enough of that! You're awake! And how! You're awful playing is enough to wake the dead. But, then, I found the remedy. What's going on? What's smurfed? It's a long story, Papa Smurf. It all started one beautiful morning... And Gargamel pretended he was a good fairy?! Yes! Harmony Smurf... we owe so much to you! And all's well that ends smurfy. Now we can resume our rehearsal of the "Smurphony in C." Great! Can I smurf with you? Are you going to let me play this time? - Well the fact is... - That is to say... We surely can't refuse him after all he's done. Can we? Papa Smurf... why don't we... Bravo! Good idea, Handy Smurf. Every year, winter covers the forest with a thick blanket of snow. But that year, on sunny days, the Smurfs discovered Mother Nature. Do not forget smurf there, right? Papa Smurf always says that all the snow must be smurfed. There's some, there's some, there's some, there's some... and there's some there. A present for you, Brainy Smurf. It's perfect, my little Smurfs. Everything must be finished for our big Spring Festival. Keep going! Hi there, Papa Smurf! How do you like our spring outfits? Aren't they cute? They are indeed cute! I don't like cute! Spring... my favorite season! Yuck! Spring really is the season that I hate the most. - Don't you agree, Azrael? - Definitely! With its bright sunshine... Yuck! ...its stinking flowers... ...and horrible little forest pests. Scram! But worst of all, spring is when those vile little Smurfs are happiest. They dance, they laugh... Enough, you hear, enough! I'm sick of this happiness, I can't stand it anymore. I'll stop it! If only I could capture those wretched blue midgets! But how? For years I've tried ever more diabolical tricks... ...but they always escape me. Alas. I have no choice... ...but to seek advice from Balthazar. Not Balthazar! Even the thought of seeing him makes my blood freeze. But it's the only way. The only way. Smurfs, enjoy your disgusting happiness while you can! He who laughs loudest, laughs last! Looking, looking for Easter eggs... No! You won't find Easter eggs under rocks. Are you sure? Of course not. This is where we'll find our Easter eggs. You never learn. do you? Let me handle this. You're losing your feathers. Shush! Don't say anything that'll point me out. Trust me... I know what I'm doing. What do we smurf now? We scram! I think we've lost them. Right. Along with our Easter eggs. What are we going to tell Papa Smurf? - Brainy Smurf... - Not now, I'm thinking. - Yes but... - Quiet! Eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs. I'm getting an amazing idea... ...that could only spring from an exceptional brain. Well, what's wrong with this egg? This egg? This egg here? Well, that was my idea, Clumsy Smurf. It was my idea all along. Really? Well I guess that's why you're the brains of the outfit. I don't like visiting Godfather Balthazar any more than you do, Azrael. Come on, Azrael... We must be brave! Mummy! You see that I can show I'm not afraid, Balthazar... It's me, Gargamel, your beloved godson. I know. That's why I've been easy on you. So what do you want? I'm listening. Well... I want to know how... how... how I can catch the Smurfs. The Smurfs? The Smurfs! Smurfs don't exist. The only place you'll find Smurfs is in that book. It's full of fables about mystical beings like those little elves, the Smurfs. It even has a formula for turning lead into gold by boiling 6 Smurfs. Turning lead into gold by boiling six Smurfs? How ridiculous! There's even a chapter on capturing Smurfs... ...by tricking Mother Nature into freezing them out of their village. Don't touch! Mother Nature! Smurfs! Ridiculous! Just a crazy superstition. Yes, of course.... You're absolutely right. I know what's true. Now get out of here... I've seen enough of you for one day. Of course, godfather... goodbye. I'm going to be able to capture the Smurfs and turn them into gold. I'll stew 2 Smurfs and fry 6 Smurfs all told... I'll roast 6 Smurfs and boil 6 Smurfs for gold Clumsy Smurf...! What did I do? What's smurfing on? Incredible! It's hatching! Isn't it cute?! Not bad, for a duck. Poor darling! How awful to start life by falling on your first step. It'll think you're it's mother, Smurfette. It's mother! Yoo-hoo, Mother Nature, where are you? Yoo-hoo, Mother Nature, where are you? Oh dear, it gets harder each year to warm up my old bones. Come on, wake up. Spring is here. What is it, old friend? What? Someone's coming to visit me? Why, I haven't had a visitor in centuries! I'm coming! I'm coming! Mother Nature...! I've come halfway round the world to bring you this modest token... ...of my undying devotion. Oh, how nice of you! But these aren't my flowers. No, but their scent is very subtle... smell. Oh, you are mad...! I don't feel at all well. I know...! It's what happens. Now you are in my power! Oh, no...! You'll upset the order of things... It can't be. I haven't finished changing seasons yet. Pleasant dreams, Mother Nature! We did it, Azrael... We've stopped spring from starting. Papa Smurf will turn up soon, and then... Strange...! It almost feels like winter again. Great balls of smurf...! Is it the weather or me who's crazy? I haven't seen a blizzard like this in my 543 years. We must take action immediately. I hate action. - Handy Smurf. - Right here, Papa Smurf. I want a ladder tall enough to reach the lower branches of the Old Oak. Four of you Smurfs go and lend a hand. Aye aye, Papa Smurf! The rest of you go to the storehouse and collect what food is left. Get to work right away! Aye aye, Papa Smurf! Something tells me we're in for a long hard winter. - Up you go! - Easy does it! Watch your smurf there. Put it on the plank! There we are! Oh, Papa Smurf, our village is completely buried. All our provisions, too. If this storm continues, we've all had it! What can we do, Papa Smurf? There's only one person who can explain this to us. I must go see Mother Nature. Strange...! This morning it was spring, and now it's freezing. What's happening? Something's wrong. Oh, my book has disappeared! That thieving Gargamel! But why would he steal a book of fairy tales? Unless... that's not what they are. Hullo! Mother Nature! Mother Nature! Gargamel!? How right you are, Papa Smurf. How right you are. Catch him, Azrael! Don't let him escape! I'll soon be turning you midgets into gold. I'll be the richest and most powerful wizard in the world. And you'll be no more than a bad memory. Azrael, let me introduce a very good friend of mine. Friend? Mummy! Mummy! Thanks old chap, I must get back to the village. I'll get a flying start. Azrael! Oh, I can't wait for that fool of a cat. I've got 6 Smurfs to boil. Then after, I’ll be rich... monstrously rich! How heavy she is. I'll stew 2 Smurfs and fry 6 Smurfs all told... I'll roast 6 Smurfs and boil 6 Smurfs for gold Hey, Smurfs...! Gargamel has kidnapped Mother Nature. Mother Nature?! - And 6 Smurfs. - 6 Smurfs?! And unless we rescue Mother Nature, the forest will stay frozen forever. What are we waiting for? Come on, let's go! Gargamel is really horrible. No, little duck... You stay here. No, I told you to stay. Stay in the village. Stay there. Harmony... Handy... Greedy Smurf... the door handle! Aye aye, Papa Smurf! - Vanity Smurf, guard the door. - Yes, Papa Smurf. Look! Papa Smurf! Hey, don't worry... We'll smurf you out of there! Oh, the handsome Smurf warrior guards his post. Look at these steely eyes... that firm jaw... those stunning whiskers. What? Azrael! Wake up, Mother Nature. Wake up! Quickly, Smurfs, quickly! I don't like Azrael. Quickly... the cupboard! Good work, Smurfs. Now get out while you can. Wait outside with the others, while I wake up Mother Nature. But Papa Smurf... we can't leave you here! Smurfette... That's an order! Roger, Papa Smurf! Oh, poor Papa Smurf... It must be awful facing the horrible Gargamel alone. If this doesn't wake up Mother Nature, nothing will. Little duck! What are you doing here? Look! - Someone's coming. - It's a human! That's ready. Gargamel, open up! Gargamel! What's happening? Am I dreaming? Where's my book that I know you stole?! And what of the Smurfs? Are they real? Tell me the truth! Are the Smurfs real? Of course not. They've gone. My Smurfs have vanished! But that's a Smurf! So they're real! Papa Smurf. Sorry Gargamel, but I have to be elsewhere. Gargamel, you're an idiot. You're a disgrace to our great family. Now get out of my way! Quickly, Papa Smurf! Run, Papa Smurf! Watch how to catch Smurfs. We need them... dead or alive. Watch closely. Gargamel. This is the magic wand of the future. With this, I can change the world. This is awful! Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf! Wake up! - Are you wounded? - No, it's OK. But the little duck wasn't so lucky. That was truly amazing! Silence! Hear me, Smurfs, and hear me well... I am Balthazar, wizard grand master. Surrender six of your own to me, or you will all pay dearly. Did you hear me? You'll pay dearly. Here's our answer, Balthazar! Yes, mine too! Help! I haven't done anything! You've no right to come in here! What am I doing here? I'm not at home. Mother Nature, this is the house of Gargamel. He put you under a sleeping spell, to hold back spring. Hold back spring? Oh, yes, yes. I remember now. He gave me black roses. Gargamel, aren't you ashamed of messing with the seasons? Just for your own selfish reasons. Shame on you! This is for you! No, no! Let me go! There, it's done. Spring has returned. Mother Nature, can't you do something for little duck? Oh, the poor dear. Well, let me see. There... you see. He's alright now, Smurfette. Now, that really is something to cheer about. Papa Smurf, this has been a wonderful Easter. Thank you for everything. We were glad to be of help, Mother Nature. You're just lucky I'm not a few thousand years younger, Papa Smurf. You know I'm no spring chicken, either! Mother Nature... I've a present for you, Mother Nature. It's a surprise. No, Jokey Smurf! I love surprises. Oh, they're wonderful! Goodbye, and Happy Easter! Happy Easter, Mother Nature. I don't like happy endings. Subtitles by FatPlank
