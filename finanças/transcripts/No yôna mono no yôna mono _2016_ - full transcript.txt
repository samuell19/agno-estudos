Ready. Say cheese! Look. Nice! Good photo. Now I'll take one. Look this way. Cheese! You look good! Great smile. - Good. - Nice shot. - Let's take one together. - Good idea. Ready. Say cheese! Happy Birthday Shinden by Yumi - Home screen! - Let's do it. COUPON 2 Cans of Beer No prize...? Something Like Something Like Something Like It - Yamada! - Yes? You keep on feeding the same one. Please share with the others. Oh, that's true. Share equally, OK? Share equally, alright. Our 'rakugo' troupe, Defunetei, is just like these carp, we exist due to your patronage, Ms President. It's crucial, Master Shinkome. It means our Association "13th Memorial to Master Shinsen"... can be a splendid event! I am sure that in heaven, Shinsen will be watching. Time passed so quickly. Remember how we all gathered here for BBQ's? Many fond memories. And he threw up in the pond! Remember the commotion? He...? Shintoto, of course! I think you're right... And that pop-eyed goldfish died. I remember! That did happen. I wonder how Shintoto is doing these days? I hope he's doing OK. After the death of Master Shinsen, he just disappeared. Where is that bastard, and what he's doing? Shinden...? Shinden? My senior? You're here, Shintake? Say you don't drink, but drank beer so early? So methodical, even when sleeping. Why'd you come today? To show our Master, Shinkome, new material. He'll be late tonight. Is that so? By the way, did you really... tour Japan on a "Seishun 18" youth rail pass? Yeah, the railway buff pass. For how long? About 2 weeks. It was tough on my back. How'd you decide to study with Master Shinkome? I'd finished college, and had become a programmer, but sitting all day at a PC, and being slower than most, I just wasn't able to keep up. I eat and work slowly, like a local train. I see, so you quit that? I happened to watch Shinkome perform rakugo, and was moved by him in "The Tale of Bunshichi". It's a favorite of previous generations. Your birthday today? You remembered?! Of course, my junior's birthday! - What's your sign? - The Ox. That means you're 7 years older than me. If you're 7 years younger... Anyway, Happy Birthday! Thank you. Give me a break! If her funding stops, our troupe will fall to pieces You reminded her of Shintoto, which led to this crisis. That was long ago, it shouldn't matter now. The President likes big, round eyes. So she liked Shintoto, and that pop-eyed goldfish. You know that! Doing my TV food program is tough! Usual, please. Why'd I have to come?! Impossible to get Shintoto back onstage after so many years! Shintoto?! I understand how you feel. But the President demanded that he perform "Pop-Eyed Goldfish". Isn't that the original material that he wrote? Original material? As an apology, and for the pop-eyed goldfish memorial, Shintoto offered to write material, he told me so himself. Hi! Welcome home. That beer coupon isn't just for alcohol... - What's that about? - Nothing... Shintake's here! Sit as my haircut model? I like my hair this way. How about Shinden? The haircut I want to do wouldn't suit him. That's no good. It would be perfect for you. - When? - Tomorrow. But please tell Shinkome. The President looks angelic, but is a devil. This is what I think. She wants to meet Shintoto. Remember what she gave him on 2nd Rank promotion? She gave him a kimono. Pink one! Right. I only got a towel. Me, too. How about you? Doesn't matter... Listen. What if we lose her support? Drab shows in small places? Miserable junior high events? So shameful to our Master. Our honor would be gone. You say that, but in the end she funds us. A long-term relationship. Idiot! That's not the problem. Who makes it possible for a wretch like you to eat good crab?! Master Shinsen. We're completely obliged to her, through our Master. You're right. Shinmugi, no faith in your heart? Besides that, it would be great to meet Shintoto! But where is Shintoto? - Don't know. - I wonder. You two are heartless. Look who's talking! You're such a timid guy. Master?! Welcome home. Getting older? Yeah, I'm 30 now. Considering that, your rakugo isn't playful. And lacks feeling. Like a kid reading an essay. It's too methodical. Can't you loosen up? Anyway, forget that. Look! Happy Birthday! Well... thank you. It's not about appearance, taste is the main thing. Oh! Have to blow out candles. Hey, Yumi! Bring some candles! Hey! Get candles from the altar. OK! Said 'candlesticks'...? No candle... Incense sticks! What's that?! Nothing much... Not nothing much. Much of something! - A mistake! - Sorry, I'll replace it. Well, here comes Kuma! Come inside. Thank you. I heard that Young Master isn't well, but I'm so poor and so busy, I wasn't able to visit. Sorry about that. How is Young Master? Thank you, Kuma. I appreciate your concern, but my son is not so well. He's not so well?! Shinden! Buy clippers and shave his head before the next event! Shaved head?! Cool hair even after promotion to 2nd Rank, they'll gossip backstage. Hey, the kettle is whistling! Sorry, here it is. From now he'll do things here, you search for Toto. Toto...? Toto. Shintoto! Former troupe member. Look! Happy New Year! From "Tsukasa" in Nikko... - Well, how is it?! - What? - Shintake's haircut! - That...? You like it? It doesn't seem to suit him... I knew you wouldn't appreciate it. To be frank, it's predictable. Not creative at all. Your rakugo isn't original either! Like listening to a kid reading a grammar text. Is the Nikko address of Shintoto's parents correct? Gift pickles were often sent to us from there. I searched for Japanese sweet shop "Tsukasa", but got no hits. You're out if you don't get a hit. Or I could get walked. Idiot! What I'm saying is... it doesn't matter if you're out or safe, just go and do it. You can't know if you don't go. Right, I'm on my way. Bye. Land for Sale "Tsukasa"? Yes, that sweet shop existed. The mother there really liked high-school baseball. They often went to games. You know where they went? They died already. Ten years...? No, may be 15? The year Sakushin was in the spring Best 8. Right, dear? You know anything... about the son? Not again! Dear! You ordered the wrong one again, this color doesn't sell. Dear! Son did rakugo in Tokyo... That husband loved her so much when was it...? Tried to catch a fly ball barehanded, broke a pinky! And his son, Shintoto... He also liked bicycle racing. Once, at a race... No way! Another mistake. You ordered pennants...?! Dear! Totally hopeless! Can we see the pennants? Sure, take a look... Where are you now? In Nikko. I remembered something. Shinniku. His wife was dose friends with Shintoto's ex-wife. Get going. Get going where? To Obasute, in Shinshu. He has an 'udon' noodle shop. On the Shinonoi scenic railway, famous for switchbacks?! Mimura Diner Meat Udon Noodles Shinshu noodles are 'soba' not 'udon'! Hello! Excuse me. Hello! Hello... Welcome! Are you Shinniku? I used to be. I'm Shinkome's apprentice, Shinden. Shinden?! I've heard of you. Do your own deliveries? My wife moved back home. Got mad at me! Hey, did you adjust the curtain? Yes, it was twisted. Actually, I don't like things being too proper. People have preferences. That feel right... Shintoto strived 20 years, but never starred. What's more, our Master died suddenly. Shintoto was naive. It was unbearable, I can understand... For 20 years...? Is it good? Full of meat. My old colleague, Shinsai, did good robot-like rakugo. He transformed into a great entrepreneur. Transformed?! You should think things over, just like I did. Later, go to my parent's house, ask my wife for his ex-wife's address. Regardless, you eat really slowly! Here, her address and telephone number. I have a message from your husband. I'm so lonely, I can't sleep alone. Oh, no...! No way! Oh! 2nd Rank You're persistent, too. Come by Izukyu? Yes, the Resort 21 train. I don't drink. Have one! But it's still daytime... You also do rakugo? What a boring guy! I start work before dawn, so it's a nightcap for me. My sister doesn't want to meet you, so ask me instead. What is it? I'm searching for Shintoto. We really want him to perform at the 13th Memorial for Shinsen. I also want to find him. He abandoned his wife and just disappeared. What's so good about his rakugo?! More enjoyable to watch a kid read an essay. He has no talent, why put him back onstage now? Regardless, thanks to that my sister remarried, and now she has a good life in a family of 4. Why don't you quit rakugo too, and get a real life? Do it for your parents. Beer, please. You're not writing a travel guide. Your purpose is to find Shintoto. Understand? What's this? Some connection to Shintoto? I had to buy this umbrella... But don't you think it's clever? I don't! I'm disappointed in you. That's 3 strikes, you're out. Report as missing...? Really?! Idiot! If you can't find him, I'll report him as missing. In any case, just go. Go everywhere to gather info, that's what a detective does. Detective? Rakugo is about becoming the character! Don't come back until you locate Shintoto! Find out anything about Toto? Nothing. Should I help you? What's that mean? I'll cut your hair. It's too stubby, so difficult to cut. - I'll find someone else. - Enough of that! What? Frankly, it bothers me. Shinden, you really are such a limited person. I don't need your help. I'll search on my own. You mean that? I mean it. I want to eat their local rice crackers! As a kid, I used to get Toto to buy them for me. Right at the comer, then straight. Alright, thank you. Left on the street outside. Right at the 2nd comer, quick left, right at the 2nd comer. Tum left at the 2nd comer, and you'll find Saito Barber Shop on the right side. Somehow, it's all the 2nd one! You listening? The curtain is frayed... Where? Here. Seems you have obsessive-compulsive disorder. Just ignore trivial things. Here. Black sesame rice cracker. He liked bicycle races more than rakugo. Maybe took off to flee gambling debts. In the Mt Fuji suicide forest? Forget that, I need one more guy for a hostess party tonight. Want to go? Meet Mizuho, Sakura, Azusa... Here's your salmon lunch. Shintoto doesn't eat a balanced diet. Your change, 6.2 million yen! Thanks. Nothing but deep-fried box lunches! Sometimes I add sliced radishes, seaweed, some bonus things, but he doesn't appreciate it. Humans really need a good balance. By the way, I was wondering... My son will have high school entrance exams. Do you know a good home tutor? He was usually funny, but froze up onstage. You're still an opening act. Better to quit now. Can't find work when older. You'll end up messing up, like Shintoto did. Different if you're talented... Hey, how about working here? YUMI: Big news! Toto seen. In a graveyard near Yanaka. How about that?! As you know, Shinsen's grave is there. I'm sure it was Shintoto. At a grave...? Could be a ghost? - He'll be staked out? - Why so stoked up? Have to prepare for a stakeout. Yumi, surely you don't expect to go? It's a stakeout! Forget that, what about work? I quit that. - Shinden said I have no skill. - I didn't... Better to quit while ahead. Right? It's getting dark, let's drink. I said I don't drink. You can drink one! Here. Here's your order. Yumi, you're more ugly. Compliment already? Duck with 'soba' noodles. I saw him over there before. But he shows up in different cemeteries. Did he have legs? This guy is scared. Is he your boyfriend? No way! Our apprentice, Shinden. I'm Shinden. Maybe I'll get your signature. He'll never be famous. True. Call me when done. OK. You really believe I won't be famous. Hey! Hey, look! Go and check! Me...? I'm just tagging along. Shinden, you really are too girlish. Alright, I'm going. You'll go? Take this. Toto...! It's me! Shinkome's daughter, Yumi. You boobs got so big! Yours, too! This way. No, I can't... Everyone's waiting. - No way. - Yes way. Say hi to everyone. You're late! What's going on?! You stupid bastard! You've aged. We all went to the shrine at New Year's. Remember the fortune slip? We collected 3,000 yen each. The worst slip would win it. We did that! And all prayed that we'd draw the worst slip. In the end, who drew it? I got it. That's right. He was so happy. Won 30,000 yen, but didn't treat us. I paid for dinner. At a cheap place! Nothing but basic meals! He secretly went to a brothel. But got hit by a motorbike on the way home, and we found out. He broke a bone in his leg. Such an idiot! This is great, like returning to my home. Because we're like a family, even if separated. I'm glad I came. Every month we gather like this, for Shinsen's death day. You should join us. It's not as much fun without you. You're flattering me! But Shintoto, we do have a serious request. What is it? Remember President Saito? That pretty one?! You threw up in her pond, and her pop-eyed goldfish died. Did I do that?! "Did I do that?!" Pretends that he forgot. You said you'd write material as an apology. Right, I did say that! Told you so. Did you write material? Yes, I wrote "Pop-Eyed Goldfish". We want "Pop-Eyed Goldfish"... to be performed by you at the 13th Memorial special event. Your jokes are as bad as always! The President said she really wanted to see your "Pop-Eyed Goldfish". We're so obliged to her. If you don't accept this request, we'll face a terrible crisis. It's true. The Defunetei troupe would be totally destroyed. Please. Please do it. Please. Rakugo Shintoto became ashes with Shinsen. I'm sorry I can't help out. There! Turned on its side. Next, he'll remove the lid. This is very difficult. He can't use his hands. Remove it without hands. Come here! - What are you doing?! - Ouch! Shinden... I want you to go somewhere. Where? - To Shintoto's place. - What for? Isn't that obvious? To persuade him. Said he became ashes, but I doubt it. Again?! That's too tough for me. Our future depends on it. We have to risk it all. Bring back good news only. Right, thanks. Thank you. Freshly made! Still warm! Come and get 'em! - You love 'gyoza' pot stickers! - Good! What's in them? Gourmet pork. Hey! Shinden! I'm over here! What were you doing there? I really like 'gyoza'. And what are you doing?! Tending shop. You have a fruit stand? The owner is visiting a hospital. Just sitting in for her. You still alive? - Can I come in? - Of course. - Here. - Thanks. Marinated tuna on rice. Again?! We had it just the other day. You remembered? My friend, Shinden. - I'm Shinden. - Huh? "Shinden"? Zombie name, but alive?! Yeah, everybody says that. Let's prepare it! - Excuse me. - Come in. So many old folks around here, always asking for help. Rumors spread, now I'm a handyman. Nobody asked for help. You just started doing things. You love doing it, and we're all too kind to tell you to stop. What's that about so many old folks? You're a weird guy. Old hag never shuts up. Can I add it? Good, now wait 10 minutes. - They sent you here? - Right. I told you. Shintoto is just ashes now. I know. But you have "Pop-Eyed Goldfish"? Nope. I put it in Shinsen's casket. Script also burnt to ashes?! Of course. I've always wondered why you suddenly quit rakugo. OK to ask that? Sorry, the question was too personal. My Master suddenly died. I flew around like a popped balloon, and drank every day. One day I fell down some stairs, and had amnesia. Really?! My memories didn't return for 10 years. Because of that, leave me alone and study yourself. It's not easy to live off of rakugo. Train station is that way. Bye. As One This pork cutlet place has a great reputation. So let's give their food a try. Let's go eat! The owner should be around here... Hey! Did you straighten the entrance picture? Yes. Idiot. That's why your rakugo is so inflexible. That proverb has more meaning when it's tilted. You just look at the frame. Look at the written proverb! Feel "As One" from your heart to do rakugo. How's it going with Shintoto? What's wrong? He's a strange person. I'll go see him again. OK. Wait a minute! He loves tempura on 'soba' noodles. Take this... You can order the large size. Thank you. You're going to see Toto? - What'll I wear? - You can't go. - Why not? - Don't just hang around! You should look for work. I want to see Toto... Garbage, garbage! That one! Hey! Wait! Oh! Forgot these again... You've got quite a pile! Excuse me. But why'd you come here? I'll be assisting you from today. You're so persistent. Use your own pillow. My pillowcase reeks of sweat. You can wash it. You wash it. No way! Just a suggestion. Throw out garbage at 9:00. Clean bath from 10:00. What's 'grave cleaning'? Cleaning other people's graves. OK to have others clean family graves?! That's nothing. Some even have me pray! What are you doing? I'll be doing the handyman jobs from today. Please rewrite "Pop-Eyed Goldfish". Don't interrupt my work. Hey, wait! Shintoto! Mitomo Beauty Salon Hello. Where's this go? Up there. I'll do it. I can do it! No, I'm doing it. Let me! Well, that will be useful. Also, the wall clock stopped. Can you fix that too? Sure, I'll take care of it. Huh? Where does the battery go? Idiot. This is a wind-up clock. Wind it. Be careful not to wind right to the end. New guy? My name is Shinden. "Shinden"? Sounds like a "rakugo" name. Something like it... I may not look like it, but I know about rakugo. I saw Shinsho perform "Big Drum" live on stage. Wow, that's amazing. It's working. Did deceased Master Shinsen provide training? Don't remember. But he taught me how to predict bicycle race winners. Is that so? My Master provides absolutely no training. You have to listen earnestly, and just seize skills. That's how it's done? That's how it's done. Here. Large tempura on 'soba'. Both the noodles and the broth are great here. It's good! You can taste it! My Master is so particular about the taste of broth. Sayoko was a great cook. Sayoko? Deceased wife of Shinkome. Yumi looks just like her. Yeah, does look like her. Does Yumi cook? Never. Gardening...? Never. Watches baseball, drinking a nightcap. Just like her father. Why do you like Yumi? Huh?! You like her, right? Yes... There, you said it! I confessed. To Shinden's romance. Cheers! Cheers? Hi, good morning. Why coming by so late? I ate 3 helpings of breakfast. You're so easygoing! I don't sleep well because of pain in my knee. Want a massage? Idiot. Think you can fix it? Just a suggestion. Shall we begin? That apprentice of yours is already doing it. He's a very conscientious young man. At least he's a lot more useful than you are. I'll take care of things like this. Please work on "Pop-Eyed Goldfish". Hey, go right for Masuda's place! Go right! Please write it. One more, please! OK. Pop-Eyed Goldfish: Because of him... Child: That's true. Shall I wash your back? - No way! - Don't hesitate to ask. Feels weird! What's going on? I found them in your pocket. Notes for "Pop-Eyed Goldfish". Can I inform Master Shinkome about it? I'm going to tell him. I'll tell him! It's ready! OK, coming! Huh? Thanks. Crispy skin! Hey, what are you doing? - What? - What are you doing here? Just building friendships. Here! Hey you, really are a rakugo guy! Yumi told me. Please arrange a rakugo event! You might as well, Shinden can open. Alright, I'm doing it! I don't drink... Come on, at least tonight. - OK, cheers! - Cheers! Bath Theater Shinden Take it yourself? No, don't. Daddy will take it for you. How about this red candy? Open your mouth. Don't like red? They're all the same! Don't like it? OK. Can't be helped. How about this one? Don't like this either?! They're all the same! Don't like it? Can't be helped! This has lines in it. Like it? Don't like lines either?! Can't be helped! But it tastes good. How about this? Covered with sugar. Want this one? No? Also no good. Just can't be helped. Hard to please. This one? No, broken. Mint? Want a mint? Try a mint? Don't want a mint? You're too choosy! Hey, mister! This is unacceptable! Can't sell all these licked ones! You're blaming me for it?! Can't be helped, he's a fussy kid. A boy shouldn't cry about a little smack on the back! I'm not crying about pain from the smack! I'm crying because the smack knocked a candy out of my mouth! Former Shintoto Hey! That's too much buildup! I'm thankful that so many people have come. But surprised, so fell asleep with my eyes open. Good morning, everyone! Today I want to talk about filial piety. It's said we appreciate parents only after they're gone. Tenant, come inside! OK. When visiting, don't stand, sit down. OK, I'm sitting. Got anything to eat? I won't give you food. Swallow my criticism instead. What's up, Mother? Not what's up, sun's high up in the sky! I really overslept. However, filial piety is really something. I got drunk and slept naked, but no mosquito bites. Divine protection for a good son. What nonsense! It's because I fanned you all night! Just as bad as ever. Haven't made any progress at all. That's a mean thing to say. Compared to you, Toto's "rakugo" is so free, or perhaps heartwarming, I really like it. It's OK. Don't worry about me. Shintoto, I like your rakugo, too. Hard to explain, but it purged all my inflexibility. Right. Have to love doing it. I'm envious. You've found your dreams. I haven't found mine. Let's go and eat tempura 'soba' tonight! Tasty! Shinkome... We have to reconsider. A performance like that would shame Shinsen. Shintoto isn't good, even at his specialty. Maybe if he used his own material...? No way. Here it is. Thank you. Even if the President requests it, do we have to include him, and bring shame to our troupe? Can you persuade her? I can't. Obviously. In the end, no change from the old days... It's understandable. He hasn't done rakugo for over 10 years. Maybe that talk about having amnesia is actually true. It seems possible. In fact, I've heard that... he has stage fright in front of large audiences. People say that about Shintoto, but maybe just a rumor. If it's actually true, we owe Shintoto an apology. What'll we do? We can't have a gap in the program. - Poster is printed. - Damn! Association Memorial Shintoto Hey, hey, hey! What's going on? It's my job to do that. You saw me perform yesterday. I can't do that in front of my Master. Chief Priest! Why are you so panicked? I want to chat with my grandson on a webcam, but I tried everything, nothing works. Can you take a look at it? I don't know about PC's. - What'll I do?! - Can I take a look? - Could you? - Sure. You may know. Come on! Has Shintoto really given up rakugo? Whenever we drank together, I had to listen to his awful rakugo. To make matters worse he wanted detailed feedback. I didn't think he'd ever give up rakugo. Did you hear about the amnesia? Yes, I heard. I don't know if that's really true or not, but I'm sure he feels terrible regret... that he couldn't debut his new material for Master Shinsen. Well? Any luck with the PC? Now, grandson in France... No, no, wait! I have to finish shaving first. Bare your soul in rakugo. Show the audience your true self. Shinsen's favorite saying. Shinkome taught me that. Meeting you made me fully understand it. You showed me the way. Now I recall Shinsen saying that. I beg you. Somehow or other, please perform "Pop-Eyed Goldfish". Please... Defunetei SHINSEN "Pop-Eyed Goldfish" Oh, no! My glasses...? On our way. I appreciate it. Thanks. We're off. Huh...?! I'm home! Daddy, you really bought a goldfish? I really did. Pop-eyed goldfish you like. Pop-eyed goldfish! It has a slow reaction time. Goldfish dipping! But any goldfish you'd dip up is dippy! Really slow reaction time! Oops... welcome. Please enter the e-mail address here. Do you have one? You know it? Daddy, you dipped up a pop-eyed goldfish! However, any goldfish you'd dip up is dippy! Very slow reaction time. Don't talk nonsense! They're bigger than normal goldfish. Tough to dip up! But this pop-eyed goldfish... A penguin?! Must be in the Antarctic! Defunetei SHINSEN But that can't be! Where are we really? But that can't be! Where are we really? Really in the Antarctic. Can't be! Say it's not true! I'm a penguin, it's black and white! This cold will make me frozen fish. It seems like... the feeling of the old days is coming back day by day. Hey, are you falling asleep? It's better to doze off while chatting about things. OK, what'll we talk about? Well? Hi! Good morning. - Hey, haven't you grown? - No way. The 'gyoza' you love. Shinkome told me buy some. I'm not an apprentice! I'm sure you've grown. Who cares about that?! Eat as much as you want. With thanks. Is it good? Yes, tastes great. You can listen while eating. At the Association event, you will perform "Pop-Eyed Goldfish". Don't be absurd! You're just a beginner. They'll overlook your lack of skill. I can't do it. Can't do it is not an option. You're doing it. Listen. The important thing... is not how you feel, but the honor of our troupe. But I love Shintoto's rakugo. Hard to express, but feels like it keeps seeping in. We really understand how you feel. However, what happens with Shintoto... won't be determined by what you do or do not like. You did a good job before in regards to Shintoto. It's not really a reward, but we're planning to promote you to 2nd Rank at the next event. Well, you must be astounded to hear that? Daddy, you really bought a goldfish? Yes, I bought one. So lively in that fish bowl. Hi! You're practicing hard. Why'd you come today? Well... Umm... About... that. I feel hot. I'm sorry, but it's decided. Shinden does "Pop-Eyed Goldfish"?! Are you crazy? This is about our troupe. Your objection doesn't matter. You disappoint me. About the troupe?! What will happen to Toto? Shinsui went to explain things. Shinden, what about you? Do you agree? Well? You're disgusting! 5th Generation Shinsen 13th Memorial Event Thank you. Thanks for coming. Enjoy the show. We managed to find that foolish Shintoto, but he has a strained back, and simply is not able to move about. Things like breath control and acupuncture didn't help. As if we're repaying good with evil, no apology will suffice... Although a poor substitute, and being fully aware of his many weaknesses, we want Shinden to perform "Pop-Eyed Goldfish" instead. Will you give us permission? Please accept this request. Gone...? Yamada, please help! Please do whatever you can. Me...?! Please try to improve her mood. I'll give it a try. But won't be held responsible. Everyone went already. What are you up to?! I can't go. Shinsen never saw "Pop-Eyed Goldfish", finally it can be seen today. But at the last moment, you're too afraid, that's just too wretched! That's not the situation. What's going on?! Your kimono! Can't go onstage without it. I told you, I can't go to the event. To Shintoto - Producer's friend? - Yes. Welcome to the show. Thank you. Hey! Shinsai! Don't use my stage name after so long. Mr. Executive! Master, congratulations. Thank you. The titanium alloy golf club your company designed... is selling quite well. Well, thanks. Listen, how about a round of golf next week, with that club? But my shoulder's been stiff... Shinden's not here! He was here just now. Go and find him! What's this? Odd thing... What is it? Hey, Yumi. Have you seen Shinden? Well... I see... He really did it?! He doesn't answer his phone. Staff haven't seen him. What's that bastard up to?! What'll we do? Apprentices searched. He wasn't found. Bastard Shinden! He'll be expelled! Expelled! Expelled or whatever, what do we do now? We have to fill the gap somehow. It could be a disaster. Somehow, my head is spinning. And your head should be shaved! You lousy bastard! Shinkome, calm down! It's not the time for such things. Hold on... Shintoto is still available. Right? Go backstage, and call Shintoto. Shinkome, are you alright? Shintoto isn't coming. Shinsui went to apologize to him, he will not come. That's true. Pull yourself together. Listen... In any case, we have to decide. Toto! He came! He's great! Check on Shinden. Toto, we were waiting! You're amazing, really great! Defunetei SHINDEN SHINTOTO... With such big eyes, you can't be sleeping! Thanks for waking me up. Good morning, everyone. I am Shintoto. Shintoto! Our Association "13th Memorial to Master Shinsen"... is honored to have so many guests, thank you. I have many memories of Shinsen, but forgot every one. There is an idiotic apprentice in our troupe, his name is Shinden. We'd intended to promote him to 2nd Rank today, but he has a bad sense of direction, and went to the Kamchatka Peninsula instead, so I am taking his place. I was going to debut my new work here, but Shinden will perform it to attain 2nd Rank. In a poor tenement in Shitaya, there was a poor monk by the name of Sainen. Although called a monk, he wasn't a usual temple monk. That sounds like the classic play, "Greed"... It can't be! It's definitely "Greed". What about "Pop-Eyed Goldfish"...?! So he chanted "Glorious Lotus Sutra" to get better donations. He even carried a Christian cross! Sainen was sick in bed with a cold. Sainen! Sainen! I know I will be expelled. But it's wrong for a novice to perform your "Pop-Eyed Goldfish". If you happen to read this, please perform "Pop-Eyed Goldfish". Defunetei SHINSEN Today is my Association event, and the President, Director, and many VIPs will be present. Although an important event, I got the location wrong. I held the map upside down, and ended up here. From Yamazakicho Shitaya to Yamashita Ueno, from Sanmai Bridge to a main street in Ueno, from Onarikaido to Gokencho, passed in front of the Torii Hori estate, straight ahead, down a big street from Sujikai Gate, from Shingokucho to Kajicho, Imagawa Bridge, Kokucho to Muromachi, crossed Nihonbashi Bridge, from Toori 4-chome to Nakabashi Bridge. Up the slope to likurakatamachi, passed in front of Okame dumpling shop, straight ahead, down Azabunagasaka to Juban. Up Daikoku Slope to Ipponmatsu, all exhausted arriving at Mokurenji Temple in Azabuzekkokamanashi. Wow, I'm tired too! It's terrible! Daddy it's terrible! Hey, Daddy! Be quiet! It's early morning. What's wrong?! Pop-eyed goldfish... Pop-eyed goldfish... What's wrong with it? I got up and went to feed it, but can't find it anywhere! Maybe it was kidnapped? No way, nobody would target people as poor as us! Or maybe... it ran away from home! But why would it run away from home?! Because I said it had small eyes yesterday, maybe it ran away because I made fun of it! Probably, you shouldn't have said that. OK, I'll search the neighborhood for you. Burble, burble, burble, burble... Dam! Said my eyes are small to make fun of me. I showed you! Oh, the riverbank! Finally at the river. Flowing water really tastes great. I feel like a fish in water! Feel relieved, but hungry. So long since I splurged on sushi. Hello! Somebody swimming from over there. Who? Oh, no! Bad-ass black bass! Such fish ate my friends. I asked why they were eaten. Such fish ate my friends I asked why they were eaten. Bass said "Who cares, it's a fish eat fish world." I hate a black joke from a black bass! It's not funny. You ate my friends. Ignore him and pass. Hey, hey, you better not ignore me! He noticed me! Don't want to be eaten! Who you running from? Can't just pop off, pop-eye! He used the funds for a successful rice cake shop. Those cakes still symbol 'having the Midas Touch'. Great show! It's serious! Why swallow a pop-eyed goldfish?! My old human pump trick. I tried doing it again, but the fish got stuck. You're hopeless! Turn around, I'll pound your back. Count of 3, 2, 1! Good, it came out! Hey, it's not breathing! Heart massage! 1, 2, 3... Are you alright?! Hey, you! Hey! You came back to life! But not pop-eyed, now you're a fancy goldfish. Why'd you come back more splendid than before?! I came back without pop-eyes, to make your eyes pop in surprise! Lousy show! That went over really well. I'm impressed! The great performance we'd expect from Shintoto. Maybe make a serious comeback? No, it's impossible. The President was delighted, the honor of our troupe is restored. Shintoto, thank you so much. I hope Master Shinsen watched... Of course he did! He is here in spirit. This brings closure. Shinkome... Please take care of Shinden. That bastard did a terribly impulsive thing. I'll need endless hearts with that apprentice! Fate works in mysterious ways. But it worked out in the end. Shinsui, what about your performance? Oh, I have to go and prepare! Thanks. Do your best. Well, here I go. Defunetei SHINSEN You eat as slowly as ever. No bath at your place, so use ours. Don't get carried away with 2nd Rank promotion, the hard work starts now. Right. He already moved! Already...?! To give bicycle race betting tips, packed up and left. Please accept this 'sake'. 2nd Rank towel. That's great. Congratulations! Thank you. Well, I'm off. Good luck, do your best!
