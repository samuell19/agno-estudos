ADAM: I was a good soldier. I had purpose and I loved it. (GUNSHOTS ECHOING) I rode shotgun in a lead Humvee and I looked for bombs. You don't see the bomb unless they want you to. You sense it. You just know. I avoided the bomb that day. But led us right into an ambush. That's how Emory happened. EMORY: Clear. (GUNS FIRING IN DISTANCE) Fuck. (GUNSHOT) Man down! Hang on, Emory. I got you! (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (ADAM GRUNTING) Hang on, Emory. Hang on. I got you. (EMORY GROANING) Hang on, buddy. Hang on! (CONTINUOUS GROANING) (ADAM GRUNTING) (PANTING) (RETCHES) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (MAN LAUGHING) Oh, my God. Why are fat people so funny? I swear, the funniest fuckers that ever lived they're always fat mother-fuckers, you know? Is that why you're getting out? You're gonna get fat? Yeah. Yeah, I'm getting fat. Chappelle isn't fat. Then you got Chris Rock. No, no, no, you're doing a black thing. What? I'm doing a black thing? You're doing a black thing. No, I'm not, man. What? Black don't count? I'm doing the funny thing. Yeah, nice try, SaMo. You're barely black. I've seen you naked. Ooh! (CHUCKLES) I've seen your weak shit too, boy. One-and-done, and didn't see shit. Yeah, you been one-and-done your whole life. This my second deployment, dumb fuck. If you had any fucking brains up there, it'd be your fucking last. Fuck that. Army saved my life. Yeah. Okay. So, when's the bachelor party, champ? Oh, man. I can't have a bachelor party. You've seen me drunk. Yeah, you'd fuck a blister. (CHUCKLES) So what? No. My girl's not into it. I just don't want to fuck this up, all right? So much for balls, man. The bachelor party is none of her business, all right? That's our thing. Look, I want you guys to come meet her before the wedding though. Shit, this guy, that's all he talked about for the past 11 months. I feel like I'm married to her. Dude, in that fucking video, when you're going like that and... (EXCLAIMING) Fuck you, man! You serious? Yeah. If she found out you saw that... Seriously. I just didn't know you're left-handed. That's... (CHUCKLES) Guys, don't fuck with me, man. Seriously, don't fuck with me. Hey, nobody saw shit, all right? That stays here. It's a fucking joke, okay? OPSEC. (BILLY SIGHS) But it was a pretty great video. (BOTH LAUGH) (ALL CHEERING) (ALL CHEERING) Hey, stay off the streets, all right? I'm back in the sand in three months. That's not what I said. Private Morgan. PFC Waller. Thank you. Sergeant Schumann. Welcome home, Sergeant Schumann. Specialist Aieti. (CHEERING CONTINUES) Sergeant Schumann, I'm Amanda Doster. I need you to tell me how my husband died. Sergeant Doster, James Doster. Were you there when he died? No. Did he suffer? What did he say? I need to know. Tell me how my husband died. (BABBLING) Can we get a pie? Of course we can. Eat your dinner first. You girls look so pretty. (JAX COOING) What about Jaxy? And Jaxy, yeah! That's a sweet little jumper there, buddy. (JAX CONTINUES COOING) I can't believe Amanda did that. She ruined everything. Doesn't matter. We wanted to make it nice for you. It is nice. It was supposed to be perfect. We wanted it to be perfect. It is perfect. I'm here. I got all my limbs. I got all my pieces with my favourite girls, and Jax. It's perfect, baby. (TRAIN HORN BLARING) I wanna have a baby, Sol. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) You can't wait till we're home? (CHUCKLES) (SPEAKS SAMOAN) You are getting out, right? They'll probably come after me to re-enlist, but... Solo. I'm just saying. MAN: You back from Iraq? Yes, sir. Eleven months and 19 days. You kick some ass over there? Yeah. Yeah, man. SASKIA: Where are you going? I wanna swing by the old house. Are you trying to make yourself crazy? Maybe. How are the renters? I'd like them a whole lot more if they didn't live in our fucking house. They're not watering my lawn. We'd probably still live here if you hadn't bought that pool. Our kids are gonna learn to swim in that pool. Oh, yeah? Are they gonna learn how to swim when they're teenagers? Where did that come from? We're getting back in this house. Hello? Tracey? Tray! Baby! Fuck! (ON VOICEMAIL) This is Tracey. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you when I can. Tracey, where are you? Where's our furniture? I'm trying not to freak out, but I just got back and the electricity's off, my debit card isn't working. Can you call me? I love you. Just... Just call me, all right? (BREATHING HEAVILY) (ON VOICEMAIL) This is Tracey. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you when I can. Tracey, where the fuck are you? ADAM: How much we save by living here? SASKIA: Not enough. (MUSIC PLAYING) Am I getting laid or what? Oh, yeah, you're getting laid. In fact, I might lay an egg up in here. No more eggs or seeds or any of that. Come on, you don't want another one? Let's see how you feel after a weekend alone with them. And where do you think you're going? Hmm... Hmm? You left three times. Now it's my turn. Well, I'm not leaving again. I'm home for good. (MUSIC CONTINUES) Do you remember who we were before all this? A couple of dumb, horny kids. Pretty much. Still dumb and horny. With a couple kids. (METALLIC SCRAPING) (METALLIC SCRAPING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) How long you been up? It's already 4:00 p.m. in Baghdad. You guys ready for some hotcakes? (SIZZLING) Are you chewing gum? When did you become a gum chewer? Tell me you didn't miss my pancakes. It smells good. I need you to watch the kids today. Can you handle them for a couple hours? Yeah. Sure can. All right. I got some bacon here. It's you and me today, Zoe. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) And Jax. And the Jax-man. Got it. I was thinking my mum could babysit tonight and we could go to the speedway. You know I like that. Hey... I'm gonna stop by the golf course later, see if they need any greens-men. Okay. What? It's a kid's job. Same job I had before. You were just in charge of a dozen men and now you're gonna mow grass? Hey, can you turn that off, Zoe? No. All right. Got one chocolate chip smiley face pancake for you. I hate chocolate. You do? Yes, silly bum-bum. Hey! She doesn't like chocolate. Okay. I guess I missed that part. What else? Anything else that I missed? Here you go, Specialist. DOCTOR: What are you taking the Somex for? It was to sleep over there. And what about the Propranolol? Yeah, I don't think I was taking that. Are you bothered by racing thoughts? No, sir. Reliving past events? Not really. Any lapse in memory? Uh... I lose stuff sometimes. You mean, you misplace things? Yeah, or things I was gonna do or trying to remember if I did. How about mood swings? No. When you were hit with the IED did you experience discharge from the ears? I just wanna get back to my unit. The company physician in Rustamiyah documented complaints consistent with traumatic brain injury. I feel good. I'm ready to go back. (TIRES SCREECHING) (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENTS) Do you want a blow job? Right here? If it'll make you feel better. Don't underestimate me. I'm tougher than you are. So you don't have to spare me the details 'cause you think I can't take it. I can take anything you can. Anything but quiet. It was just different this time. Different how? This one felt a lot longer. Towards the end, things took a turn and got really bad. Were you with Doster when he died? No. I wasn't there. Sometimes they get a little crazy when we're gone, right? You just gotta give her a minute. It's not like she packed a bag, dude. She cleaned me out. I gotta figure this out. Can we see that nudie video then? Such a dog. What, you got a video, Shoe? She's hot, man. I will fuck you up. You promise? I swear, it's like the whole time you're out there, all you wanna do is come home. Come home, and home's just fucked, you know? Hey. You had a rough landing, buddy. Yeah, fucking crash landing. I gotta make some money. That video, bro. You serious? I'll give you 20 bucks for it. SOLO: Mmm. You too, Shoe? Yeah? Yeah. 20 bucks. Maybe I'll just redeploy with you, Solo. Stack checks for nine months, you know? Hey, I'll tell you what, I fucking love you man, okay? But you're a bomb magnet. You got blown up seven times. Hey, you can come stay with me until we square your shit up. We should get a house. Just us. Man love Thursdays, every day. That's supposed to make me feel better? Yeah? Yeah. Faggin' out with your coco ass? Oh, my coco ass? ADAM: Shots fired. (SOLO CHUCKLES) SOLO: Whoo! Do you ever think about Emory? Emory's alive, man. He's back home in Arkansas. Maybe we should go visit him. Yeah, you should drive down there. Do you ever think about Doster? Let it go. Did they teach us that in basic? All right. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Oh, shit! (SOLO EXCLAIMING) SOLO: This is it! Let's go, buddy. Yeah, Will. It's your song, boy. (SONG CONTINUES) (BOTH GRUNTING) (ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (GRUNTING AND WHOOPING) ALL: (SINGING) I don't know why you're not there I gave you my love, but you don't care So what is right and what is wrong? Gimme a sign What is love? What the... (SHUSHING) (LAUGHING) (SOFTLY) Oh, no! Oh, shit! Hey, man. I got kids, man. I'm sorry, man. All right, get your ass on the couch. I'm not staying here, bro. It's fucking dumb, man. What do you mean, man? My house is beautiful. Come on, there you go. That's all you. This is me? That's you, right there. Get! (SHUSHING) (LAUGHING) Hey, man, seriously, I'm about to kick your ass. And take your shoes off. They're muddy as shit. Sorry, bro. You're not gonna come snuggle, Shoe? No, you're not my type. I don't like red-headed, ugly-looking dudes. (BOTH LAUGHING) Here you go, princess. All right. You cool, man? Yeah. All right. Hey, this couch is yours for as long as you need it, all right? Yeah. You're a good man, Sar'ent. You know that? (CHUCKLES) All right. See you tomorrow, man. Will. Why are you doing this? Don't. Don't what? Please don't. Not here. What? It's over. I'm sorry, but it's over. We were gonna get married. You cleaned me out, took my daughter. She is my daughter, not yours. How can you say that? I've been there since she was born. You were gone forever. That was because of us. I enlisted for us. I can't do this with you. Do what? Do what? Don't make me call security. You've got to go. Where do I go? (SNIFFLES) ADAM: Told him to stay. Why wouldn't he just stay on the fucking couch? Fuck! He got blown up seven times. He was fucked up. Normal people don't get blown up. Normal people don't get robbed blind by their fucking fiancée, man. They don't get blown up, bro. If he was so fucked up, why didn't he say anything? Army won't let me redeploy. They trying to discharge me. For what? What do you think? My shit's scrambled. I don't belong here. ANNA: My boy was hurt. He was injured. You couldn't see it, but, uh, but he was. I could hear it in his voice, in the way he talked to me on the phone. But there was only so much he would let me do. If you're hurt like he was, talk to someone. Please don't do this. SOLDIER: Firing party, attention! Port arms. Firing party, prepare for ready, three volleys! Half-right face! Attention. Ready. Aim. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Adam Schumann? Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry, I was gonna come and introduce myself earlier. ANNA: I just wanted to say thank you for looking after my son over there. He was my brother. We looked after each other. He'd been struggling for months over there. We planned ahead. We found a treatment facility in California. The guy who runs this place, uh, he was a soldier. He's been doing it for 30 years. So if you know anybody who needs... ADAM: Thank you. I'm really glad you're here. When did she become friends with Doster's wife? When he took over our platoon. Does she know that he took your place on the rig? No. Let's go, bro. Can we go? I thought you were on Klonopin. It doesn't work. None of it works. Will liked to hunt, so we're going hunting. Will liked to hunt, so we're going hunting. Be careful. I'm Captain Careful. (OBJECTS CLATTERING) Let's go shoot something. Nobody knows you fought unless you got your fucking arm blown off. I'd take it. I'd rather be a hero with my ass blown off than this shit. I don't even feel like me anymore. I guess you don't know what I mean. You don't got stress. You're good, right? I don't think that guy lost his arm picking flowers, man. What the fuck does that mean? It means we don't know shit about him. Would you rather lose your leg than this? Below the knee? Nah, above the knee. Fuck it. I'll take it. How about your ear? Can I still hear? No. But you can still finger-fuck it. And you can hear out of your other ear. (CHUCKLES) But I won't look like no war hero, just some freak with no ear. Hey, what was that... You remember that Bravo who got his lips blown off? Who? Pussy face? Yeah, pussy face. (LAUGHING) Oh, fuck. That's what you want? Hell no. You remember what you said to me the day Doster died? When we were dragging him inside? I remember his skin was so burnt it was falling off. The smell. You don't remember what you said? No, bro, I don't remember shit. My memory is shot. What did I say? You said that none of it would have happened if I'd have been there. That's a fucked thing to say, man. (GUN COCKS) All right, I'm gonna scare them towards the water. You push up from that bend. (NIGHT VISION GOGGLES POWERING UP) (RUSTLING) (NIGHT VISION GOGGLES POWERING UP) (WHISPERING) Solo! Hey! Solo! (RUSTLING) Hey, you trying to get fucking shot? What? What the fuck are you doing out there? I wasn't out there. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Yeah, you were. I saw you out there. I didn't even make it out there. It's too dark. I forgot my goggles. I saw you. No, you didn't. Wasn't me. (CLATTERS) You all right? No, man, I'm not all right. Fuck! I still taste his blood. I carried him down those stairs. I can still taste his blood. What do we do? (SNIFFLES) We get some help. Yeah. Okay. SASKIA: Are you coming to bed? Yeah. (TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY) Think I'm gonna try and find a job early tomorrow. (SIGHS) Okay. You all right? I'm good. You got mud everywhere... So clean up. Come to bed. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Alea's pregnant. Yeah? Nice, man, that's great! Hell yeah! You're gonna do great, seriously. Kids change everything. I'm gonna name him after me so I don't forget his name. Can I have your VA card, sir? My VA card? Mmm-hmm. What? Am I supposed to have one of those? If you don't have one, you need to go to the second floor. Okay? You understand? Special forces guy was telling me ecstasy cures all this shit. (SCOFFS) Yeah? What the hell are we doing here? COLONEL PLYMOUTH: Sergeant Schumann. ADAM: Yes, sir. At ease. I didn't recognise you in civvies. I don't recognise myself sometimes either, sir. Got out a few months back. Why'd you go and do that? The wife. I was downrange three times with two kids. Roger that. What's this line you're in? We're applying for service connection, sir. Shoe, you were my hammer out there. Don't let these young guys see you fold like this. It's bad for morale. Bad for Big Army. ADAM: That shiny medal mother-fucker. He didn't do our war. He wasn't fucking kicking in doors. He fought his war at a fucking computer. Anybody home? Fuck it. (RUSTLING) (JAX SHOUTING) (JAX SHOUTING) ADAM: Eggs, no chocolate chips. ZOE: Come on, Jaxy, just sing it. SASKIA: Hurry up, Zoe. We gotta get to school. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Will's mum gave me the number to this treatment facility out west. Out west? California. Fuck! This shit could give me PTSD. MAN: This is our care package. Fill it out, and on review, you'll be directed to a primary care physician and psychiatrist. How long does that take? Usually 12 weeks, but we're in arrears so... Arrears? Yeah, we're backed up. It could be six to nine months. Are you kidding? (CHUCKLES) You think these guys can wait that long? Excuse me? I said, how many of these guys in this room do you think will make it six to nine months? If you're finished... No, I'm not finished, man. Look. We need to see somebody, okay? You're feeding me this fucking arrears bullshit. My boy here fought his ass off. All right? He did his job, now do yours. I'll see him. Okay? I've got 20 minutes left on my lunch. Just have him come around the side. Okay. Thank you. All right, look alive. You're up. What about you? Nah, you go first. I'll get the next one. MS. SANDERS: It says here you're having trouble remembering. Can you tell me the date? It's May. Good. How about day and date? Thursday. Today is Wednesday, May 7th. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Are you having any suicidal ideation? I... I just wanna get back to my unit. It must be hard to be separated from your brothers like that. Yeah. We're having a baby. That's great! So you'll have a new unit. Do you remember the date? Yeah, you said, uh, Thursday, May. So we're having a little trouble with that. Let's try word association. To me, the word Wednesday sounds like wedding day. I always wanted a big wedding. Did you have a wedding? Yes, ma'am. So when I ask you what day it is, I want you to think of your wedding. (SIGHS) Are you still having nightmares? Sometimes I see Doster. He's on fire. But mostly, I'm awake. You see him when you're awake? The smell. Do you remember what day it is? Wednesday, wedding day. Good job. You see, that's great, and we can use that to remember anything. So you could help me fill this out? (SIGHS DEEPLY) I'm sorry, I'm booked with patients during my lunch all week. Can your wife help us? I... I haven't told her. You gotta share this with her. (SNIFFLES) ALEA: (READING) "Have you used drugs other than those required "for medical reasons?" Never. (CHUCKLES) "Are you always able to stop using drugs when you want?" Mostly. They're drugs. That's a stupid question. "Have drugs ever created a problem between you and your spouse?“ No. You were arrested for possession four times. That wasn't a problem? Well, we weren't married. (CHUCKLES) Okay, the next section is "Exposure to Combat Scale." "Were you ever under enemy fire?" I feel like I am right now. Hey. Baby, you're doing good. "Were you ever pinned down?" No. "How often did you fire rounds at the enemy?" Uh... I was supposed to count? Options are, "Never. "One to two times. Three to 12 times. "Thirteen to 50 times. Over 50." Over 50. (CHAIR SCRAPING) "How often did you see someone get hit by incoming or outgoing rounds?“ "Never. One to two times. "Three to 12 times. "Thirteen to 50. "Over 50." (SCREAMING) ALEA: Solo. Hey. (ZOE AND ADAM SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) ZOE: You're silly. ADAM: You're silly. ADAM: You know I built this, right? ZOE: Yeah, sure... I really wanna come in, so how do I get in? (ADAM CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Come in! Ready? Ready? Oh, it's nice in here. I know. (MUSIC PLAYING) Damn! Look at you. Where'd that come from? Don't worry about it. (BED RATTLING) (GUNFIRE ECHOING) (GUNSHOT) Get off! (PANTING) What happened? What did I do? I don't understand. Tell me what to do. I need you to talk to me, Adam. It's time. I've given you months! I thought we were broke, and you're buying fucking lingerie! I thought you were fine. You're lying to me! I found your VA questionnaire! Everything's a lie! I'm not lying. You're fucked up! You're not looking for a job! You're sick, and I can't do anything if you don't fucking talk to me, Adam! I have to be sick or I can't get my benefits. So you don't want to die? It was multiple choice, and you said you wanted to die. Was that a lie? Hmm? Adam. (SIGHS) I don't know. I wanna go to the VA with you next time. All right. Adam talked about a treatment place in California. Could I go there? MS. SANDERS: Look, the problem is, is the army doesn't have record of you participating in this incident that caused your TBI, so I can't get you service connected. What? There's no record? You didn't report an injury at the time of the incident. Doster was dead. I dragged him out. They're denying benefits until we prove that you were in the Humvee. We need to go back to your COs and get written testimony. They don't believe I was there? We just need to go back and get proof. SERGEANT MOZER: Come on, Specialist, sit down. Do you know why this is the greatest country on the planet? I'll tell you. It's because with a click of a finger, I can order 20 pounds of beef and have it delivered to my door in 24 hours. The terrorists cannot do that. And that is why they will never win. So, sounds like you got some bad paper. Yes, sir. I'm glad that you're seeking treatment because we got 22 veterans a day killing themselves. And I don't get it. Warriors get stressed. We know this. But this obsession to end your own life, I can't wrap my head around it. We don't want you to be a statistic though, do we? No, sir. You signed up during wartime, you got yourself a war. But they don't believe that I was there, sir. They're as wrong as two boys fucking in church. Give me that file. Let me see what you got. (SIGHS) I just need a statement saying that I was driving the rig when Doster was hit, sir. American Samoa? Where is that? South Pacific, sir. It's a territory. So does that make you a... A citizen, or... How does that work? I was able to apply for citizenship after basic training, sir. I'm going for the New Yorks. Fuck it. You know? Yeah. Boom. Boom. Boom. (ENGINE ROARING) (ENGINE ROARING) Why are you braking? Why? (TIRES SQUEALING) You'd have done great in Iraq, babe. We never slowed down. We just ran them over. Did you drive? I rode shotgun and looked for the IEDs. They'd hide them in trash like that or... Once they got smarter, they just started cementing them in curbs. So when you see trash on the road here... I look. That's the first real thing you've told me about the war. I feel so much better now. SASKIA: Hey, don't be an ass-hole. Two Army Commendation Medals. An Army Achievement Medal. Impressive. You never told me about those. Is there a specific incident that troubles you? Maybe a name? Emory. What happened with Emory? I dropped him. I was carrying him. I dropped him. And they had to cut two inches of his brain out. And then Doster happened. What happened to Doster? Why don't you tell us our options? There is no cure for trauma. But we can learn to manage it. Long-term care has the best results, but every facility is different. Some are four weeks, some are nine months. What works for one person may not work for another. But all these places are equally difficult to get into. So the smartest thing to do would be to apply everywhere and cross our fingers. Cross our fingers? There are hundreds of thousands of men and women seeking help. But he's a veteran. That's what I mean. There are hundreds of thousands of veterans seeking help. Will we get priority to places closest to us? I'm afraid not. What do we do in the meantime? What if I had a job? I think a job would help. A job is good. Your benefits won't be kicking in for another couple of months, so... Another couple months? Wow! What the fuck is going on around here? (SIGHS) I have a position at a heavy ordnance range. He wants to kill himself, and you want him to work at a gun range? It's a tank range. You think I could kill myself with a tank? Maybe. It would take some serious planning. Well, you're pretty fucking resourceful. (CHUCKLES) I used to be good at that. At what? Making you laugh. (SNIFFLING) Was I laughing? (CRIES) You should have told me I was married to a hero. I'm not a hero. (SIGHS) Hero enough. I just wanna get back into our house. Me, too. We're not that far off. Oh, yeah? Did you win the Powerball and not tell me? Amanda loaned us some money. Amanda Doster? Yeah. We were at Will's funeral and she offered. What the fuck are you doing? I told her we were trying to get back into our house. Do you not fucking get that she has that money because her husband's dead? And that her husband is dead because of me? What the fuck, SASKIA? (SIGHS) Fucking Christ. (SIGHS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) What's up, homie? What you want? I got nickels, dimes, two finger sacks. What about some ecstasy? Some ecstasy? Man, I don't sell that right here. Get the fuck out of here. Come on, man. Roll it up. Who I gotta see? Fuck does that mean? Fuck, is you 12? Show me some bread, dawg. I got some pills. I don't fucking take pills. I look like a fucking pawn shop or something to you, nigga? Well, you look like your fucking balls ain't dropped. Huh? What you... How about this, mother-fucker? (WOMEN SHOUTING) (DOGS GROWLING) (MEN SHOUTING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) What up, Big Army? You're all out of pocket here. How'd you know I was military? Yeah, I stormed that desert myself back in '91. 24th Infantry. All right. Did you get it on waivers? You got that look. Army saved my life. What they doing for you now? Gotta make your own way now. MAN: Oh, yeah! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) You know where I can score some ecstasy? Ecstasy? (CHUCKLES) Man, does this look like a god-damn rave? It's not for a rave. It's for an injury. Shit, if you're injured, man, doctors up there at Fort Riley giving out that Oxy like it's candy. It's not that kind of injury. (DOGS GROWLING) (MEN CLAMOURING) You was all in it, weren't you? Did you lose some guys? Or are you one of them murdering mother-fuckers? (DOGS GROWLING) (MEN SHOUTING) (DOG YELPING) (DOG WHIMPERING) (DOG WHIMPERING) (DOG MOANING) (WHISPERING) Hey, buddy. It's okay. It's all right. I got you. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. I got you. ADAM: Was this dog fight downtown? Yeah, mate. You're gonna be all right, buddy. I got you. ADAM: Can't be going down there, man. You got a kid coming. (DOG WHIMPERS) Hey, stop moving, man. You're vibrating the whole damn table. Do you remember the dogs in Rustamiyah? That runt that went on raids? Little Caesar. He was Emory's dog, wasn't he? You ever talk to him? No. Do you think he's like us? I just told you, man. Haven't fucking talked to him. (BREATH ES HEAVILY) Do you remember what that Iraqi cop did to Caesar? Yeah. I wanted to kill that mother-fucker. Two guys in Bravo got back at him. You hear about that? No. What did they do? Same shit he did to Caesar. Held him down and snipped his fucking Achilles with a bolt cutter. Fuck, yeah. (SHUDDERING) Fuck. (SNIVELS) We're gonna be all right, man. We're gonna get in a treatment facility somewhere. And then what? Huh? J... Just goes away? What is that? It's a dog. I can see that. Why is it here and not at a vet? It... It's a fighting dog. They won't let dogs like this in. (SIGHS) (SCOFFS) Were you outside of Amanda's earlier tonight? Nope. SASKIA: She said you were. She saw your truck. Well, if you weren't sucking money off her, you probably wouldn't fucking care. I care about you, not her. The dog has to go. It's a pit bull. We have kids. (GRUNTS) (BREATH ES HEAVILY) (CLATTERING) We're not allowed dogs in our apartment. (CHUCKLES) Well, shit. I guess I got a dog. (ARMY CHATTER) (PLANE WHOOSHING) (ARMY CHATTER) (PLANE WHOOSHING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? (GUNFIRE) Something's burning. ALEA. (SCREAMS) Fuck! No! (GRUNTING) Oh, my God! No! Solo! (GRUNTING) (YELLING) (GRUNTS) (THUDDING) (CRYING) Mum, call the police! (WHISPERS) It's okay. (HEAVY BREATHING) (THUDS) (JAX WAILING) Oh, my God, the baby! ADAM: I'm so sorry.
