Ah. The damage to the spinal column's not yet been determined, but his breathing's stabilized. His liver's been saved. Oh, well, that's good news. None of this is good news, Lenny Magrath. It's all a grueling nightmare. You Mark my words, those responsible will pay dearly. Thank you. Etty may, you be sure to defrost that chicken for supper. And there's a can of Vienna sausages in the cupboard for your lunch, and you give peanut butter and jelly to those children. Yes, ma'am. I'm gonna smash you. You take your stupid man. Get him out of here. I hate him. Stop throwing my man! You're breaking my man. Stop it! I won't stop it! I won't! Lenny! Aah! Aah! Yoo-hoo, Lenny! Well, this is just too awful. How I'm gonna continue to hold my head up high in this community, I do not know. Did you get those pantyhose I asked you-- they're in the sack. Daddy has called me twice already. He says we got to get ourselves to town to help out with this thing with Babe before they change their simple minds. I was sort of hoping that Meg would call. Meg? Yeah, I sent her a telegram about Babe-- a telegram? Couldn't you just phone her up or something? Well, no, I couldn't because her phone was out of order. Out of order? That's right. It was disconnected. I don't know. Well, now, that sounds just like Meg. What all did you say in this telegram? I just told her to come on home. To come on home? Lenny, have you lost your only mind or what? Babe is going to be incurring mighty negative publicity in this town, and Meg's appearance isn't gonna help things out one bit. These are awful snug. Did you get my right size? Well, let's see. I think they're... Size extra-petite. Well, they are scrimping on the nylon material. Anyway, Meg is known all over copiah county as cheap Christmas trash. Well, the her sordid dealings with Doc Porter, leaving him a cripple. A cripple? He's got a limp! He just kinda barely has a limp. His mother was gonna keep me out of the ladies' social league because of that. Oh, Chick, please, I'm sorry, but you're in the ladies' league now. That's right. I am. But quite frankly, if Mrs. Porter hadn't developed a tumor on her bladder the way she did, I wouldn't be in the ladies' social league, much less a committee chairman. Anyway, I want you to stay right here and wait for Meg to call so that you can convince her not to come home. How's my hair? Fine. It's not pooching out in the back is it? Oh, no. All right, then, I'm on my way. Oh, I almost forgot! Here's a present for you. Oh! Oh! Happy Birthday to Lenny from the Boyles. Well, thank you, Chick. It's so nice of you to remember my birthday every year like you do. Oh, now, you know that's just the way I am. That's the way I was brought up to be. Go ahead, open it. Oh, all right, all right. It's a box of candy, assorted creams. Candy. That's always such a nice gift. Oh, well, speaking of which, remember that that little polka dot dress you got for P.K. on her birthday last month? Yes, the red-and-white one? Yes, that's the one. Well, the first time I put that in the washing machine, and I mean the very first time, it just went all to pieces. Those little dots just dropped right off into the water. Oh, no. Oh, no. I'll just get her something else, then. I'll just get her a nice little toy or-- no, no. I just wanted you to know so that you wouldn't spend any more of your hard-earned money on that make of dress, you know, those inexpensive kinds? They just don't hold up. My word! That's Doc Porter. Whoo-hoo, doc! Whoo-hoo! Hey. How in the world are you doing? Fine. I can't stay. I have people waiting on me. You know, it's this thing with Babe. Yes. Well, good-bye. Farewell. Nice seeing you. Hey. Hi. Uh, Lenny... Yes? Oh, here's some pecans for you. Why, thank you, doc. I just love pecans. My wife and Scotty picked them up around the yard. Why, I can make a pie... Like, a nice pecan pie with 'em. Lenny, I got some bad news for you. You do? Yeah, last night Billy boy died. Oh, he died? Uh-huh. He was struck by lightning. He was struck by lightning in that storm yesterday. That's what we think, yeah. Gosh. Gosh, I've had Billy boy for such a long time, ever since I was 10 years old. Well, he was a mighty old horse. Mighty old. Hey, today's my birthday. Did you know that? No! Happy Birthday! Thanks, doc. Oh, Lenny, come on now. Hey, now, come on. You know I can't stand it when you Magrath women cry. Oh, sure. You mean when Meg cries. Meg's the one you never stand to watch cry, but not me, oh, no. I could just fill me up a great big old pig's trough, couldn't I? Lenny, come on, now. Stop it, Jesus. I'm sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me, doc. It's this thing with Babe, and now granddaddy's gotten worse in the hospital and I can't even seem to get in touch with Meg at all. Is Meggie coming home? Who knows? She hasn't called me. She still living in California? Yes, she is, out there in Hollywood. Well, give me a call if she gets in. I'd like to see her. You would, would you? Yeah, Lenny. Sad to say, but I would. Ok. ♪ Happy Birthday to me ♪ Happy Birthday to me ♪ Happy Birthday, dear Lenny ♪ Happy Birthday to me Watch your step, please. There she is! Hey! ♪ Happy Birthday to me ♪ Happy Birthday to me ♪ Happy Birthday to Lenny ♪ Happy Birthday-- Lenny? Meg? Lenny? Meg! Meggie, is that you? Yeah! Meg! Why didn't you call? I've been trying to get you. Oh, Lenny! I'm so happy to see you. We're getting so old. Oh, I called. Of course I called. I never talked to you. I let the phone ring right off the hook. As a matter of fact, I was out most of the morning seeing Babe. Yeah, now, what is all this business about Babe? Lenny, how could you send me such a telegram about Babe? I know. And Zackery? You say somebody shot Zackery? Yes, they have. Well, good Lord. Is he dead? No, but he's in the hospital and they shot him in the stomach. In his stomach? Yes. Oh, how awful. I know. Do they know who did it? Do they, Lenny? Well, who? Who? Who shot him? Babe! They're all saying Babe shot him. They even took her to jail. Good Lord! Jail! Yes! Oh, no. Well, who? Who's saying that? Who? Everybody's saying it-- the police, the sheriff, Zackery-- even Babe's saying it. Even Babe herself! Oh, for God's sake. It's so terrible. It's the worst thing in the whole world. Now, Lenny, calm down. Just calm down. Okay. Would you like a Coke? Yes, I would. Would you like me to get you one? Yeah, I'd love a Coke. Why would Babe shoot Zackery? Why? Well, I hate to say this. I do hate to say this, but I believe that Babe is ill-- I mean, in her head ill. Oh, now, Lenny, don't say that. There are plenty of good, sane reasons to shoot another person. And I'm sure Babe had one. Now what we got to do is get her the best lawyer in town. You got any ideas on who's the best lawyer in town? Zackery is, of course, but he's been shot. Count him out. Count him and his whole firm out. You don't have to worry anyway because we've already got Babe a lawyer. Who? Barnette Lloyd, Annie Lloyd's boy. He just opened up his office. Uncle Watson said we'd be doing Annie a favor. By hiring him-- what about Babe? Huh? Have you thought about that? You want to do her a favor of 30 or 40 years in jail, huh? Have you thought about that, Lenny? I'm just trying to do what's right and I don't think you have to snap at me like that, Meg. Oh, boo-hoo-hoo. Please stop it. And what was that you were saying anyway about how old we're getting? Only I don't think you meant we. You meant me, didn't you? Oh, I know, I know. My face is just getting pinched and my hair's falling out in the comb oh, my God, Lenny! This is your birthday! Oh, how could I have forgotten? Happy Birthday! My God, we're getting so old. Is old granddaddy here? Huh? Why, no. Granddaddy's at the hospital, Meg. Again? Yes, but don't you remember? I wrote you about those blood vessels popping in his brain. Popping? Yes, and how excited he was to hear from you. And find out about your career. Didn't you get my letters? Oh, I guess I did. I don't know. Sometimes I kinda don't read your letters. What? Well, I used to read 'em. It's just since Christmas, reading them gives me these slicing pains right here in my chest. Oh, I see. I see. I suppose that's why you didn't take that money old granddaddy sent you at Christmas to come on home, because you just hate us so much. Oh, come on now, Lenny. You think I'd be getting pains in my chest if I didn't care about you? I mean, if I hated you? Honestly, now, you think I would? Well, no. Lenny, I'm free. I'm free! Oh, Babe. Take me home. I'll take you home. We're going to go home right now. You ok, Babe? Was it terrible in there? I bet it was awful. Don't you worry. Babe! Oh! Oh, little Babe! Oh! Oh! Oh! I can't believe you're home! I'm so glad to see you! Oh, God! I'm so glad you're home! Oh, my little Babe. I'm so relieved. Hello, Margaret. You're looking mighty good. Thank you uncle Watson. And how have you been? Not bad for a tired old fat man. Uncle Watson thinks he's fat. He is fat. I have him on a diet. Why, Chick, hello. Cousin Margaret, now, what brings you back to Hazlehurst? Well, I came on home-- I came on home to see about Babe. Mm. So how are things with you, Babe? Well, things are dismal, if you want my opinion. She's refusing to cooperate with her lawyer, that nice-looking young Lloyd boy. And she won't tell any of us why she's committed this heinous crime. Oh, look. Lenny brought my saxophone from home! And my suitcase! Thank you. You're welcome. Meg, look at my saxophone. I went to Jackson and bought it used. It's so heavy. Now, listen, Rebecca, that lawyer wants some concrete answers! No more stubbornness, or they're gonna put you in jail and throw away the key. Isn't that right, daddy? Won't they put her in jail and throw away the key? Well, honey, I don't know about that. Well, they will. And they'll leave you there to rot. So, Rebecca, what are you gonna tell Mr. Lloyd about shooting Zackery? What are your reasons going to be? I didn't like his looks. I didn't like his stinkin' looks. I don't like yours either, Chicklestick. So leave me alone, and I mean it! Just leave me alone! Well, I was just trying to warn her that she's going to have to help herself. She just doesn't seem to have any idea how serious this situation is now, does she? She just doesn't have the vaguest idea. Well, it's true. She does seem a little confused. That is putting it mildly, Lenny, honey. That is putting it mighty mild. So, cousin Margaret, how's your singing career going? We've been looking for you in those movie magazines. You shouldn't smoke-- causes cancer of the lungs. Each one of those little cigarettes is a stick of death. That's what I like about it, Chick, taking a drag off death. Mmm... What power! What exhilaration! Here. You want a drag? Did y'all hear that Zackery's liver's been saved? His sister told me his liver's been saved. I think that's just the best news. Oh, yes, that's fine news. That's mighty fine news. Did you hear all that news about the liver, little Chicken? I heard it. Cluck. And don't you call me Chicken. Cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck. I've told you a hundred times, if I have told you once. Do not call me Chicken! I'm not 12 years old anymore. Cluck cluck. Cluck cluck cluck. ♪ go to bed! Mom, I'm thirsty! I want some water! Now, I mean it! Don't give him any water. He'll wet the bed. Go to bed right now! I said go to bed right now, or I'm gonna send both of you to reform school. You know, Chick's hated us ever since we had to move here from Vicksburg to live with old grandmama and old granddaddy. Well, she's an idiot. Yeah. You know what she said this morning when I was still behind bars and couldn't get away? What? She told me how embarrassing it was all those years ago, you know, when mama... Yeah, down in the cellar. She said our mama had shamed the entire family, and that we were known notoriously all through Hazlehurst. She went on to say how I would now be getting just as much bad publicity and humiliating her and the family all over again. Just forget it, Babe. Just forget it. I told her mama got national coverage. National. And if Zackery wasn't a senator from Copiah County, I probably wouldn't even get statewide. Of course you wouldn't. Gosh, sometimes I wonder. What? Why she did it. Why mama hung herself. I don't know. She was having a bad day, real bad day. That old yellow cat. Oh, it was sad about that old cat. Yeah. I bet if daddy hadn't left us, they'd still be alive. I don't know. It was after he left that she started spending whole days just sitting there smoking on the back porch steps. Well, I'm glad he left. God, he was such a bastard. I thought if she'd felt something for anyone, it would have been that old cat. Grinning with white teeth. Daddy was such a bastard. Was he? I don't remember. Ouch! Get away! Get away from me! Do you want me to come in there and jerk you both bald-headed? Now, I mean it! If you two kids don't shut up and get out here to this car, I'm gonna call Santa Claus, and I'm gonna tell him to come down the chimney and eat you both up! Ow! I mean it! I'm gonna smack your face in. I'm as serious as a heart attack. Babe, why won't you tell anyone about shooting Zackery? Oh. You must have had a good reason, didn't you? I guess I did. Well, then, Babe, what was the reason? I can't say. Oh, Babe, why not? I'm sort of protecting someone. Then you didn't shoot him. No, I shot him all right. I meant to kill him. I was aiming for his heart. But I guess my hands were shaking and I just got him in the stomach. So, I'm guilty, all right, and I'm just gonna have to take my punishment and go on to jail. Oh, Babe. Don't worry. Jail's going to be a relief to me. I can learn to play my saxophone. I won't have to live with Zackery anymore. And I won't have his snoopy old sister Lucille coming over and pushing me around. Mom? Mom! Help me, mom! Here's your lemonade. Get away! Thanks. Thank you. It tastes ok? It's perfect. I really don't feel very thirsty. Well, I like more sugar in mine. I'm gonna add some more sugar. Babe, don't make such a mess here. Please be careful with that sharp knife! Honestly now, that sugar's gonna get you sick! I mean it! Really! Boy. I don't know what's happening to Lenny. What do you mean? Well, she's turning into old grandmama. You think so? Well, more and more. Look there. She's even taken to wearing old grandmama's torn sunhat and her lime-green garden gloves. Lenny works in the garden wearing the lime-green gloves of a dead woman. Oh, no. Yesterday was Lenny's birthday. That's right. I forgot all about it. I know. I did, too. Oh, God. That Chick is so cheap. What? This plastic has poinsettias on it. Poor Lenny. She needs some love in her life. All she does is work out at the brickyard and take care of old granddaddy. Yeah, but she's so shy with men. Yeah. Probably because of that shrunken ovary she's got. Yeah. That deformed ovary. Yeah, old granddaddy was the one who made her feel self-conscious about that. It's his fault, old fool. I bet Lenny has never even slept with a man. I bet she's never even had it once. I don't know. Maybe she's had it once. She has? Maybe. I think so. When? When? Well, maybe I shouldn't say. Babe! Oh, all right. It was after old granddaddy went back to the hospital the second time, Lenny calls me up and asks me to come right over and bring along my polaroid camera. But when I arrived, she was waiting for me in the front parlor. Babe, I need you to take some snapshots of me. But now, you swear you won't tell a soul? But I'm sending my picture to a lonely hearts clubs. It's called "Lonely Hearts of the South." I saw their ad in a magazine. Two weeks later, she receives in the mail this whole load of pictures of available men, most of them fairly odd-looking. Maybe.... What? But this one, this Charlie Hill from Memphis, Tennessee, - he calls her up. - Yeah? Well, he drives down here to Hazlehurst about three or four different times and has supper with her. And then, this one weekend, she goes up there to visit him. I think that's when it happened. What makes you think so? Well, when I went to pick her up at the bus depot, she ran off the bus, threw her arms around me, and started crying and sobbing as though she'd like to never stop. And I asked her, I said, "Lenny, what's the matter?" She says, "I have done it." You think she meant that she'd done it? I think so. Oh, goddamn! She didn't say anything else about it. She talked about the boot factory where Charlie worked. And about what a nice city Memphis was. What happened to this Charlie? Well, he came to Hazlehurst just one more time. Lenny took him to meet old granddaddy at the hospital and after that, they broke it off. Because of old granddaddy? Well, she said it was on account of her missing an ovary. Charlie didn't want to marry her on account of it. Who's that? Shoot! It's that lawyer. I don't want to see him. Babe, come on. Babe. You have got to talk to him sometime. No, I don't. Yes, you do. Just tell him I died. Babe, come down here. No! Babe! No! Get down here, Babe. Shit. How do you do? I'm Barnette Lloyd. I'm Meg Magrath. Babe's oldest. I know. You're the singer. I heard you five times when you were singing at that club in Biloxi. Greenies, I believe, was the name of it. Yeah, Greenies. You were very good. There was something sad and moving about how you sang those songs, as though you had some sort of-- thank you. That's very kind. Now, about Babe's case? Yes. Well, we've just got to win it. I intend to. Well, of course, but it's just-- well, you're very young. Yes, I am. I'm young. It's-- let me just think this out. Exactly how do you intend to get Babe off, I mean, you know, keep her out of jail? Well, it seems to me we can get her off with a plea of self-defense. Or possibly we could go with innocent by reason of temporary insanity. But basically, I intend to prove Zackery Botrelle brutalized and tormented this poor woman to such an extent she had no recourse except to defend herself. In the only way she knew how. I like that. Well, then, of course, now I'm hoping this will break the ice and we'll be able to go on to prove the man's a total criminal as well as an abusive bully and a contemptible slob. Yeah, that sounds good. To me, that sounds very good. That's our basic game plan. Uh-huh. Now, how you going to prove Babe's been brutalized? We don't want anyone committing perjury. Perjury? According to my sources, there'll be no need for perjury. You mean it's the truth? You should take a look at this. It's a photo static copy of Ms. Botrelle's medical chart over the past four years. What? Oh, this is madness! Did he do this to her? Well-- did he? Well, miss Magrath's-- oh, I'll kill him! I will. I'll fry his blood. To tell you the truth, I can't say for certain what was accidental and what was not. That's why I need to speak with Ms. Botrelle. It's very important that I see her. What did Zackery do to you? Did he hurt you? Did he, Babe? Goddamn it. Yes, he did. Why? I don't know. He started hating me 'cause I couldn't laugh at his jokes. Babe, this is very important. I want you to tell me what all happened right before you shot Zackery. I told you, I can't tell you on account of I'm protecting someone. Babe, you just got to talk to somebody about this. You just do. Why? Because it's a human need to talk about our lives. It's an important human need. All right, then. Well, do you remember Willie Jay? Cora's youngest boy? Oh, yeah. That little kid we used to give a nickel to to run to the drugstore and bring us a cherry Coke. Right. Yeah. Well, Cora irons at my place on Wednesdays now, and she just happened to mention that Willie Jay had picked up this old stray dog. He'd gotten real fond of him. Now they couldn't afford to feed him anymore, so she was gonna have to tell Willie Jay to set him loose in the woods. Uh-huh. I said I like dogs, and if Willie Jay wanted to bring the dog over here, well, I'd take care of it. So the next day, Willie Jay brings over this skinny old dog with these little crossed eyes. Well, I asked Willie Jay what his name was and he said they called him Dog. Uh-huh. Anyway, when Willie Jay was leaving, he gave Dog a hug, and he said, "Good-bye, Dog. You're a fine old dog." Well, I just felt something for him so I told Willie Jay he could come over and visit with Dog anytime he wanted. His eyes lit right up. Anyhow, time goes on, and Willie Jay keeps coming over, and we talk about Dog and how fat he's getting, and well, then, you know, things start up. No, I don't know. What things start up? Well, things start up, like sex. Like that. Babe, wait a minute. Willie Jay is a boy, a small boy, about this tall. No, he's taller now. He's 15 now. When you knew him, he was only about 7 or 8. Even so, 15? And he's a black boy, a colored boy. He's a negro. Well, I realize that, Meg. Why do you think I'm so worried about his getting public exposure? I don't want to ruin his reputation. I am really amazed. I am really completely amazed, Babe. I didn't even know you were a liberal. Well, I'm not. I'm not a Liberal, I'm a Democratic. I was just lonely, and he was so good. I never had it that good. We'd always go out to the garage and-- it's ok. I've got the picture. I've got the picture. Let's just get back to the story, when you shot Zackery. All right, then. Let's see. Willie Jay was over. It was just after we-- yeah. We were just standing around the back yard playing with Dog. Bring it back. Come on! Come on! Come on. Come here. Bring it here. Right here. Come on, drop it. Right here. Go get it, Dog. Suddenly, Zackery comes from around the side of the house. What you doing back here, boy? He's not doing anything. You just run on home, Willie Jay. You just run right on home! Uh! Don't you ever come here again. I'll cut your gizzard out. Do you hear that? You keep going, now. Go on! I was gonna shoot off my own head. That's what I was gonna do. And then suddenly I thought about mama and how she hung herself. Here I was about ready to shoot myself. Then I realized-- that's right-- I realized I didn't want to kill myself, and mama, she probably didn't want to kill herself either. She wanted to kill him. I wanted to kill him, too. I wanted to kill Zackery, not myself, because I wanted to live. You little idiot. Oh, Christ. All right, now. Where were we? I just shot Zackery. Right. You've just pulled the trigger. Tell me... Do you think Willie Jay can stay out of all this? Believe me, it's in our interest to keep him as far out of this as possible. Good. All right, now. You've just shot Zackery Botrelle as a result of his continual physical and mental abuse. What happens now? Well, after I shot him, I put the gun down on the piano bench and went out into the kitchen and made a pitcher of lemonade. Lemonade? Yes. I was dying of thirst. My mouth was just as dry as a bone. So in order to quench this raging thirst that was choking you dry, preventing any possibility of you uttering any intelligible sounds or phrases, you went out to the kitchen and made up a pitcher of lemonade. Right. I made it just the way I like it, with lots of sugar and lots of lemon, and I added two trays of ice and stirred it up with my wooden stern spoon. Then what? Then I drank three glasses, one right after the other. They were large glasses, about this tall. And then suddenly... My stomach kind of swole all up. Hmm. I guess what caused it was that sour lemon. Could be. Then what I did was I wiped off my mouth with the back of my hand, like this. I did that to clear off all the little beads of water that had settled there. I see. Then I called to Zackery, "Zackery, I made up some lemonade." Can you use a glass? Aah. Oh. Lemonade? No. Lemonade, no. What? No. You don't want any? No, call-- would you like a Coke instead? No. No Coke. Get-- oh, Christ. Get-- I guess that's gonna look kind of bad. What? Fixing that lemonade before I called the hospital. Well, not necessarily. I tell ya, I think the reason I made up the lemonade was because I was afraid they would see that I tried to shoot Zackery. The fact that I'd shot him and... They would accuse me of possible murder and send me away to jail. Well, that's understandable. I think so. I mean, in fact, that's just what did happen. Yes, here I am, practically on the brink of utter doom. I feel so alone. Now-- now, look. Why, there's no reason for you to get yourself so all upset and worried. Don't you worry, Ms. Botrelle. We're gonna have a solid defense. Please don't call me Ms. Botrelle. My name's Becky. People in the family call me Babe, but my real name's Becky. All right, Becky. Are you sure you didn't go to Hazlehurst high? No. I went away to a boarding school. Gosh. You look so familiar. Well. You sure do. I doubt you'll remember, but I did meet you once. You did? When? It was at the Christmas bazaar, year before last. You were selling cakes and cookies and candies. You bought the orange pound cake. Right. Of course. Then we talked for a while. We talked about the Christmas angel. You do remember. I remember it very well. Hello. This is Mr. Barnette Lloyd speaking. Mrs. Botrelle's attorney? Yes, that's correct. I'm Mrs.-- Becky's attorney. Well, listen to this, Mr. Barnette Lloyd. I want you to get your attorney butt-- ooh! I want you to get your attorney butt over here right now, and I'm gonna show you some really blackenin' evidence I got against your little lily-white client. Why, certainly, Mr. Botrelle. I'd be glad to check out any pertinent information you may have. RCA's releasing the album this spring. I'm gonna have my picture on the cover. I'll be eating a big pineapple, sitting under a palm tree. Won't that be as cute as a bug? Yeah. Look, child. We really missed you. I was sorry you weren't here at Christmas. I was mightily ashamed you didn't come. I'm sorry, old granddaddy. I really am. The reason I didn't use that money you sent me to come home for Christmas was I was right in the middle of making this huge, multimillion-dollar motion picture, and I was just under too much pressure. Why, sure you were. Listen, don't you give that Christmas another thought. You just tell me all about that new motion picture you're in. Well, it's coming out in the spring. Yeah. And it's called "Singing in a Shoe Factory." Oh. But I don't really have a large leading role. It's more of a small leading role. The director of the movie thinks this is gonna be the big break that I've been waiting for. In fact... My real name is Becky. Good-bye, Becky. Good-bye, Barnette. Good-bye, Beck. Oh. Hi, Lenny. Hello. How's old granddaddy? He's just fine. He's just wonderful. He's never been better. Who ate this candy? Meg. Do you see? This was my one and only birthday present to me. And look what she's gone and done. Will you please see this? She's taken one little bite out of each piece of candy in this box. Then she just put it right back in. Oh, that is just so much like her! Lenny-- I can't help it! I can't help it. It just gets me mad! It just gets me upset! Meg has always run wild. You know she started smoking and drinking when she was 14 years old. She never even made her own bed. She never made it-- yet somehow she always seemed to get what she wanted. You remember how she's the one who got the singing and dancing lessons. And you know you remember how she always had 12 golden jingle bells sewed onto her petticoats, while we were allowed three apiece. Just tell me why! Why? I don't know. Maybe she didn't jingle them as much. Well, I can't help it, Babe! It just gets me so mad! Look at this! Lenny, things have been hard for Meg. After all, she's the one who found mama. I know she's the one who found mama. That's always been the excuse. But I tell ya, Lenny, after it happened, Meg started doing all sorts of these strange things. Like what? Well, like things I never wanted to tell you about. Well, what sort of things? Well, for instance, she used to force herself to look in that horrible black book in old granddaddy's study. What horrible old black book? The one called diseases of the skin. Here, I'll show it to you. You're not kidding. What are you doing? Be careful. It's full of the most sickening pictures. Aah! Look here. These rotting-away noses. That's disgusting. Oh! Oh! The eyeballs drooping down the sides of people's faces! That's the worst thing. Sores and scabs. It's so terrible. Oh! Oh! God, that's just-- eaten-away places. Oh, God, some people-- that's just the worst thing. That's horrible. That's enough. It's the same way she forced herself to look at that poster of crippled children stuck up in the window at Dixieland Drugs, you know, the one where they asked you to give a dime. Meg would stand there and stare at their little crippled legs. Then she'd purposely go and spend her dime on a double-scoop ice-cream cone and eat it all down. She'd say, "See? I can stand it. Just look how I'm gonna be able to stand it." Well, I suppose you'd have to be a pretty hard person to be able to do what she did to Doc Porter, Babe. Oh, shoot. It wasn't Meg's fault that hurricane wiped Biloxi away. Just because the roof fell in and clunched the Doc's leg. It wasn't her fault. It was Meg who refused to evacuate. She wanted to stay because she thought a hurricane would be... Oh, I don't know, just a whole lot of fun or something. And then everybody says that she baited Doc into staying with her. She said that she'd marry him if he'd stay. Well, he has a mind of his own. He could have gone. But he didn't because he loved her. And then what'd she do? She just left him to go to California, just went and left because of her career. That's what she said. Hello. Hi, Meg. Here's your paper. Thanks. Here it is, right on the front page. All right, I lied. I couldn't help it. When I saw how sick and tired old granddaddy had gotten, those stories, they just flew out. All I wanted was to see him smiling and happy. He is sick, isn't he, Meg? Oh, God, he's just gotten all white and milky. He's almost evaporated. But still, you shouldn't have lied, Meg. It was wrong for you to tell such lies. Well, I know that. Don't you think I know that? God, I hate it when I lie for that old man. I do. I feel so weak. Then I gotta go out and do three or four things I know he'd despise just to get even with that miserable, old, bossy man. Oh, Meg. Please don't talk that way about old granddaddy. It's so ungrateful. Why, he went out of his way to make a home for us and all he ever wanted was the best for us. I guess so. Sometimes I wonder what we wanted. Well, one thing I wanted was a team of white horses to ride mama's coffin to her grave. That's one thing I wanted. Babe. I don't understand why you put in all those articles about unhappy things in your life. Why would you want to remember them? Well, I don't know. I just like to keep an accurate record, I suppose. Oh, Babe. Oh, that's nice. Mmm. Oh, pictures of when I got married. Meg, come over here. Take a look at this. Let's see. You look about 12 years old. I was just 18. Look, you're smiling, Babe. You were happy then. I was drunk on champagne punch, I remember that. Look at you there. Oh, Billy boy. Oh, look! There's Meg singing at Greenies. I wish you were still singing at Greenies. Meg, you looked so beautiful. You are. You're beautiful. I did not. Stop it. Hey, Meggie. What? Are you starting to cry? No, I'm not. Oh, we don't want Meggie crying. We better turn the page. No, come on. Oh, it's daddy. Jesus, where'd you get that picture, Babe? I thought mama burned them all. I just found it around. That smile. Jesus, those white teeth. Turn the page. We can't get worse than that. That's mama. The cat. I think you better turn the page, Babe. That old yellow cat. You know, I bet if mama hadn't hung that old cat along with her, she wouldn't have gotten all that national coverage. Why are we talking about this? Yeah, I think you're right. I think Meg's right. This is too sad. It's awfully sad. I remember how we all sat on this bed the very day at the service all dressed up in our little black velveteen suits. We were just-- we were crying all morning long. Now, hush all that crying, children. Old granddaddy's going to take you out for some breakfast, and whatever you want, you're going to have. Looks like you need some more silvers of nuts. Bring this young lady here a plate of nut slivers. And this child's ready for another round. Now remember, no pineapple topping and plenty of syrup. Just go on and bring a big king-size bowl of chocolate syrup. Banana splits for breakfast. I think I ate about five. We were so sick. Oh, we were, weren't we? Your face turned all green. Lenny's face turned green. I was sick as a dog. Old grandmama was furious. She was mad. You know, the thing about old granddaddy is he just tries to make us happy. We keep getting stomachaches and throwing up in the flower arrangements. That was me. I threw up in the flowers. Babe, you're so embarrassing. Oh, I love you, Babe. Oh, Meg! Oh, Lenny. It's so good to be home. I'm glad you're back. Oh, wait a minute. Oh! Oh! Oh! I have an idea. What? I think we should play cards. Oh, let's do! It'll be just like when we used to sit around the kitchen playing Hearts all night long. I know! I'll go up and fix us up some popcorn. Okay, that's a good idea. Yeah, and hot chocolate. Let's see now. Let's see. I think I have a deck of cards in here somewhere. Gosh, I hope I remember all the rules. Are Hearts good or bad? They're bad, aren't they, Lenny? That's right, Hearts are bad, but that black sister is the worst of all. Oh, that's right, and the black sister is the Queen of Spades. And the spades are the black cards that aren't the puppy dogs' feet? Right. She counts lots of points, and points are bad. Mm-hmm. Here, I'm gonna get some paper so we can keep score. I know. Here they are. Goodness, will you look at these things? Why they're a hundred years old. Hello. No, this is Meg. Doc? How are you? That's good. You're where? Why, sure, come on over. Yeah. All right. Bye. It's Doc Porter. He's down the street at Al's Grill. He's gonna come on over. He is? Yeah. He said he wanted to come on over and see me. Well, you still want to play? No, I don't think so. Aw, Meg. Well, it really isn't that much fun playing cards with only two people. Yeah, I'm sorry. I just-- you know. Maybe I'll join you after Doc leaves. Well, I know. Maybe Doc would like to join us. We could have a game of Bridge. No, I don't think so. Doc never liked cards. Maybe we'll just go out somewhere. Meg? Hmm? Well, Doc's married now. I know. You told me. Well, as long as you know that. Just as long as you know that. I know that. She's the yankee. Meg, could I ask you something? What? I just wanted-- I just wanted to ask-- I just wanted to ask you just why... Why... Did you take one bite out of each piece of candy in this box and then just put it right back in there? I was looking for the ones with nuts. The ones with nuts? Uh-huh. There are none with nuts. This is a box of assorted creams. All it has in it are creams. Meg, if you'd please look right here at the top of this box. It says right here, in clear letters, assorted creams. Not nuts. And besides, I wanna tell you something. It was my one and only birthday present to me. It was my only one! Well, Lenny, honey, I'll get you another one. That's not the point! I don't want another box! What is the point? Well the point-- I just-- well, okay, I don't know what the point is. It's just that you just have no respect for other people's property. You're just always taking whatever you want. Do you remember how you always had layers and layers of jingle bells sewn onto your petticoats while Babe and I only had three apiece? She's going on about those stupid jingle bells again. Well, that's right, Meg, because it's a specific example of how you got what you wanted. Come on now, Lenny. You're just upset because Doc called. Who said anything about Doc Porter? Why, I have long since given up worrying about you and all your men! Hey, listen, I know I've had too many men. Believe me, I have had way too many men, but it's not my fault you haven't had any. Well, maybe just that one from Memphis. What one from Memphis? Well, the one Babe told me about from the club. Babe! Meg! What? How could you, Babe? I asked you not to tell anyone! Why'd you open your mouth? You never said not to say anything. Can't you use your head just for once? Did you tell anybody else, Babe? No, I never told anyone else. Somehow it just slipped out to Meg. Really, it just flew out of my mouth. What do you two have, wings on your tongues? I'm really sorry. Well, I'll never-- I'm never gonna be able to trust you ever again! Lenny! Come on now, Lenny. We were just worried about you. We just wanted to find a way to make you happy. Happy? Happy? Oh, no, I'll never be happy! Not if you live your life as old granddaddy's nursemaid! Oh, Meg, shut up! Oh, I can't help it. Now, I just know the reason you broke off with that man from Memphis was 'cause of old granddaddy. Oh, what? You mean Babe didn't tell you the rest of the story? Well, she said something about your shrunken ovary. Babe! Meg! I just mentioned it. Oh! I don't believe a word of that story. I don't care what you believe, Meg. It's always just been so easy for you. You always have so many men falling in love with you, but I have this shrunken ovary and I just can't have any children. Look at my hair. It's just falling out in the comb. So you just tell me, what man is gonna love me? Oh, Lenny, lots of men. A lot of men. A whole lot of men. It's only old granddaddy who seems to feel otherwise. Yeah, because he doesn't want to see me rejected and humiliated. Lenny, stop being so pathetic. Now just tell me, did you actually ask this man from Memphis all about-- no, I didn't because... I just didn't want him not to want me. Oh, Lenny. Lenny-- no, don't! Don't talk to me anymore. I think I'm going to vomit! I just hope this doesn't cause me to vomit! See? She didn't even ask him about her stupid ovary. She broke it off because of old granddaddy, what a jackass-- oh, Meg, shut up. Why do you have to make Lenny cry? I just hate it when you make Lenny cry. Lenny? Oh, Lenny. Lenny? Well, Doc. Well, it's Doc. So, Meggie, you're home. Yeah, I come on home. I come on home to see about Babe. How is Babe? Fine...well, fair. She's fair. So you want a drink? Sure, what you got? Bourbon. You changed your hair. Yeah. Hmm. So, you want to take a ride in the country and look at the moon? So how's your wife? She's fine. I hear you got two kids. Yeah. Yeah, I got me two kids. Boy and a girl. That's right, Meg. A boy and a girl. That's what you always said you wanted, wasn't it? Is that what I said? Mmm. It's been a long time. Yeah, it has been a long time. Let's see, when was the last time we saw each other? Hmm. I can't quite recall. Wasn't it in Biloxi? Biloxi? Oh, yes, I believe it was. And wasn't there a hurricane going on at the time? Was there? Yes, there was, one hell of a little hurricane, Cordelia, I believe they called it. Hurricane Cordelia. Ah, yes, I remember now. That was a beautiful hurricane. Yeah, we had quite a time down there. Drinking vodka, eating oysters on the half-shell, dancing all night long. The wind was blowing. Oh, God, was it blowing. Goddamn, was it blowing. Never been such a wind blowing. Ah, Meggie. I know, Doc. It was my fault to leave you. I was crazy. I felt choked. I felt like a fool. No. I just kept wondering why. I don't know why. Because I didn't want to care. I did care, though. I did. Aw, hell. You still singing them sad songs? Nah. Why not? Ah, I don't know, Doc. Things got worse for me. I couldn't sing anymore. Boy, I tell you, I had one hell of a time over Christmas. What do you mean? I went nuts. Ended up in an L.A. County Hospital, psychiatric ward. Oh, hell, Meggie, what happened? I don't really know. Couldn't sing anymore, so I lost my job. Then one afternoon, I ran screaming out of the apartment with all my money and jewelry and valuables and tried to stuff them all into one of those March of Dimes collection boxes. That was when they nabbed me. It's a sad story-- Meg goes mad. I don't want to start up, Doc. It would be too hard if we start up. Who says we're gonna start up? We're just looking at the moon. For one night, you and me just taking a ride in the country and looking at the moon. Just one night? Looking out at the moon. You got it. Well, all right. ♪ ♪ ♪ Becky? Becky? Barnette? Yeah, it's me. It's Barnette. Barnette. Just a minute. Well, Barnette, come on in. Look, I've just met with Zackery over at the hospital. Oh. Well, it seems his sister Lucille was somewhat suspicious. Suspicious? She hired a private detective. They were taken a couple weeks ago. It seems she wasn't going to show them to Botrelle straight away. She wanted to wait till the time was right. These are pictures of Willie Jay and me out in the garage. I know. You looked at these pictures? Well, uh...professionally, I looked at them. Oh, mercy! Oh, mercy! We can burn them. It won't do any good. They have the negatives. Oh, no. There. Oh. There now. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. There now. Babe? What? Babe? What? Are you all right, Babe? Yeah-- what? I'm fine. I'm all right. Go on back to bed. What is going on down here? Nothing. We were just... We were just dancing. We're just dancing around down here. Just dancing around down here. Well, for heaven's sakes, Babe, you frightened me half to death. I thought-- I just don't know what I thought of that-- Hello. Well, yes, this is Lenny Magrath. Oh...oh... ♪ ...Of the cottonwood trees ♪ Send me off forever but I ask you, please ♪ ♪ Don't fence me in ♪ On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder ♪ ♪ Till I see the mountains rise ♪ Ha ha! Meggie. ♪ Where the west commences ♪ Gaze at the moon until I lose my senses ♪ ♪ And I can't look at hovels and I can't stand fences ♪ ♪ Don't fence me in Dr. Logan, please... Oh, Babe, I feel bad. I just feel real bad. Why, Lenny? Because I wished it. You wished what? I wished that old granddaddy would be put out of his pain. I wished it on one of my birthday candles, and now they say that he's in this coma and that he's feeling no pain. When did you have a cake? I don't remember you having a cake. Well, you see, I didn't have a cake, but I just blew out the candles anyway. Oh, well, those birthday wishes don't count if you don't have a cake. They don't? No. A lot of times they don't even count when you do have a cake. It just depends. Depends on what? On how deep your wish is. Lenny. Well? Is he still in a coma? Mm-hmm. I think we ought to start phoning people up. I made out a list of all the people we ought to notify about old grandaddy's predicament. And I'm gonna phone half, and you're gonna phone half. Whoo! You all right? Ha ha ha ha! Ok. Ha ha ha! Oh, mighty. I just knew you'd like that one. This is WCSP, Crystal Springs, Mississippi. Say, don't forget the rodeo starting tomorrow night at 7:00. And tickets are only 3 bucks apiece, so bring the kids for free. Morning! Good morning. It's a wonderful morning. I tell you, I'm surprised that I feel this good. I should feel like hell. By all accounts, I should feel like utter hell. Hey, where's that glue? Broke the damn heel off my shoe. Oh, there it is. Well, what's wrong with you two? You look like doom. I know, you're mad because I stayed out all night long. Well, I did. No, Meg, we're not mad. We're just-- we're kind of depressed. Oh, now, Lenny, listen to me. Everything's all right with Doc. Really, nothing happened. Well...actually a lot happened, but it didn't come to anything, and not because of me, I'm afraid. I was out there thinking to myself, "What are you going to say "when he begs you to run off with him? "Are you going to have pity on his wife and those two half-yankee children?" "I mean, can I sacrifice their happiness for mine?" "Yes. Yes, I can." But you know what? He didn't ask. He didn't even want to ask. Oh, God. Why aren't I miserable? I should feel... humiliated, devastated, but for now, I'm happy. God, I realized that I could care about somebody, that I could want somebody... And I sang! I did. I sang all night long. I sang right up into the trees, and none of it was to please old granddaddy. Meg... What? Well, it's... It's just... It's about old granddaddy. Oh, I know. I told all those stupid lies. I'm going over there first thing this morning and I'm gonna tell him the truth, I am. And if he can't take it, if it sends him into a coma, well... That's just too damn bad. You're too late. What? Oh, no. What? Stop it, Meg. What is so funny? What? It's not funny. What is so funny? It's not funny, it's not funny. What? It's just that... It's old granddaddy. He's in a coma. He's what? He's in a... He's in a coma. Well, my God, that's not funny. No, it's not funny. No, it's not funny. I-- it's just... It's kind of sad. We're tired. We're real tired. My God, how is he? Will he live? They don't think so-- I think this is just terrible. We shouldn't be laughing like this. We're just like we're sick or awful-- we are, we're awful. We're awful. Oh, Meggie, I'm so sorry. It happened again last night. He had... he had another... stroke. Yeah. Yeah. Things sure will be different around here when old granddaddy dies. Not for you two, really, but for me. Aw, come on, Lenny, you're your own woman. Invite some people over. Have a party. Go out with strange men. I don't know any strange men. Well, you know that Charlie. I told him we should never see each other ever again. Well, if you told him, you can just untell him. No, I couldn't. I really couldn't, Meg. I just would be too scared. What harm could it possibly do? I mean, it's not gonna make things any worse than this-- never seeing him again, at all, forever. I suppose that's true. Course it is, so call him up. Come on, Lenny. Take a chance. You got to try, Lenny. I think you do. Yes. You should. All right. I will. I will. Meg. What? Nothing. You ok? Here. Look. Some evidence Zachary has collected against me. Looks like my goose is cooked. Why, it's you. Is that Willie Jay? He sure has grown. You're right about that. My, oh, my. Please don't tell Lenny. She'd hate me. I won't. I won't tell. What are you gonna do? What can I do? Actually, senator Botrelle, I don't think those photos are gonna flatter you at all. Folks around here might start to question certain aspects of your, uh... leadership abilities. Well...tell me. Just what sort of settlement do you have in mind? I don't want her serving time. What, in jail? No, I don't think we have to send her to prison. Then you'll drop all charges? Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll seriously consider doing that, but first you better do something about that nigger kid of hers. Or he just could end up screwed, chewed, and barbecued. Becky, I'm sorry. It seemed like the only way. Good-bye, Becky. Good-bye, Barnette. Good-bye, Willie Jay. I can do this. Ok. Just-- just-- it's no big deal. Ok. Ok. Ok. All right. Oh, I'm so ashamed. I'm such a coward. I couldn't make the call. My heart was just sort of beating like hammer, Babe. I swear I could actually see my blouse just moving back and forth and back and forth-- Babe? Oh, Babe. You look so disappointed. Are you? Mm-hmm. Oh, no. I can't stand it! I just can't stand how I've gone and disappointed my little baby sister! I just feel like howling like a dog. Oh. Lenny! Oh, not her. Lenny! Well, I just don't know what to say. I mean, I am so sorry for you, to have a sister such as that. What do you mean? You don't have to pretend to me. I saw Meg stumble out of Doc Porter's pick-up truck, and her looking like such a disgusting mess. You must be so ashamed. Well, I've always said that girl was nothing but Christmas trash. Don't talk that way about Meg. Lenny, everybody knows that Meg is a low-class tramp. And you need not have one more blessed thing to do with her or her disgusting behavior. I said don't talk that way about my sister Meg ever again. Well, goodness gracious, Lenora, don't be such a noodle. It's the truth. I don't care if it's the Ten Commandments. I don't wanna hear it in my home ever again. In your home? This is my grandfather's home, and you're just living here out of his charity, so don't you get highfalutin with me, miss Lenora Josephine Magrath. You get out of here. Don't you tell me to get out. I have just about had my fill of you trashy Magraths and your trashy ways-- hanging yourselves in cellars, going around with married men, shooting your own husbands. And don't think she won't end up in some state prison farm or some mental institution. Why, it's a clear-cut case of manslaughter with intent to kill. You get out! Out! You get out of here! That's what everybody's saying. Deliberate intent to kill. And you'll pay, you hear me? Are you crazy? Out! Out! Aah! Don't you come back here ever! Don't ever, ever come back here again! You're just all trash! You get out! Do you hear me? They will never let you in the ladies' league when they hear about this! Aah! I'll clobber you! Aah! Stop it! Help! Help! I don't want you to come back anymore! Stop that! Whoo! Aah! This is my home, this is my house! Help! Help! Hello? Oh. Hello, Zackery. Yes, he showed them to me. What do you mean? You can't do that. No! He's not. I'll do it. I will, and he won't. Great. I feel... I really feel good. I re-- I do. I feel really good. Good, Lenny. You know what I'm going to do? I'm gonna call Charlie. You are? Yes I am. I'm gonna do it. I really feel like I can do it. You do? Yes, I do. You know why? My courage is up. My heart's in it. There's no more beating around the bush. I figured, let's strike while the iron is hot. I'm going to do it, Babe. Good! Do it, Lenny. I'm calling him up. Good. Ok... Let's do it. Let's do it. Hello, Charlie? This is Lenny, Lenny Magrath. Fine, I'm fine. I'm calling to see how you're getting on. Yes, I know I said that. You see, the reason that I said that before about us not seeing each other ever again was because of me, not because of you. It's just that... I can't have any children. I have this ovary problem. Charlie, what a thing to say! They're not all little snot-nosed pigs. Oh, you think they are. Oh, dear, Charlie. Stop it, now. You're making me laugh. I can't help it. Oh, dear. Oh, my. Ha ha ha! I know. How about tonight? You do? Of course we can. Why, they're just ripe for picking up. All right. Then I'll be right here waiting. Bye. Bye, Charlie. Bye for now. Aah! Babe! Babe! Ha ha ha! He's coming! He said he's coming! I swear, Babe! Meggie! Meggie, Babe! Hey, where are you? Babe! Where are you, Meg? Oh, darn! Where are you, anyway? Yep, those papaws, they look just ripe for picking up. Come on. Come on. I beg of you. Hurry up. Oh, please. Please! Oh, mama, please! Oh, mama, please. Mama. So that's why you done it. Oh, mama. Babe? Oh, my God. What have you done? What the hell have you done? What? Nothing. Get up. Oh, Babe. Come here. Just sit down. Just sit right down here. Babe, let me see. I'm ok. Put your head between your knees. Now, breathe deep. Meg? Come on, do what I say. Meg, I know why she did it. Come on, just do what I'm saying! Meg, I know why she done it. What? Why who did what? Mama. I know why she hung that old cat along with her. You do? It's because she was afraid of dying all alone. Was she? She felt so unsure, you know, as to what was coming. It seems like the best thing coming up would be a lot of angels and all of them singing. But I imagine they've got high, scary voices and little gold pointed fingers that are sharp as blades... You don't want to meet them all alone. It wasn't what people was saying about her hating that cat. She needed him with her because she felt so all alone. Oh, Babe, why? Why? Why what? Why did you put your head in the oven? Oh, I don't know, Meg. I'm having a bad day. It's been a real bad day-- those pictures and Willie Jay heading north and Zackery called me up. He says he's going to have me classified insane and send me on out to the Whitfield Asylum. What? Why, he can't do that. Why not? Well... Well, 'cause you're not insane! That's why. I'm not? No, of course not. He's trying to bluff you. You're just as perfectly sane as anyone walking the streets of Hazlehurst, Mississippi, I am? Even more so. A lot more so. Good. We've got to find a way to get through these bad days. I mean, it's getting to be a thing with this family. And you're not like mama. You're not all alone. I'm not? No, Babe. Lenny! Hey, Lenny! What? Come here! Hurry up! There's something in here! What? What is it? Surprise! Surprise! Happy Birthday, Lenny. Oh! Oh, no! I can't believe... Oh, yes! Oh! Oh, I can't believe it. Oh, Happy Birthday. Oh. Oh, God. "Happy Birthday, Lenny, two days late." That is so cute. Oh, my word. Will you look at all those candles? It's just frightening. Yeah. No, it's not. It's good. Why? 'Cause the more candles you have on the cake, the stronger your wish is. Well, mercy my, Babe. Ha ha ha! Oh, you silly thing. Ok, come on. ♪ Happy Birthday to you No, no, wait, wait. ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ Happy Birthday, dear Lenny ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday to you Come on. Ok. Ok. Aah! You did it! I hope that wish comes true. I certainly do. What did you wish for? I can't tell you that, Babe. Sure you can. No, I can't. Then my wish won't come true. Lenny, that's a superstition. Of course it will if you want it deep enough. Come on, tell us. Yeah, come on, Lenny, tell us. Well, I guess it wasn't exactly like a specific wish. It's just... This vision came over me. A vision? It did, yeah. What was it of? I don't know exactly, but it was something about the three of us, and we were all just smiling and laughing together, but you know something? It wasn't for every minute. It was just for this one moment, and we were all laughing. Oh, Babe. What are we laughing about? Well, I don't know. Just nothing, I guess. Just nothing. Lenny, that's a nice wish. Hey, Meggie. Oh, good God. Come on, here's the knife. Cut the cake in celebration of Lenny being born. Ok. Give each of us a rose. Ooh, that icing is delicious. A whole rose, Babe, all right. Aah! Oh, dear. I'll take this one. Ha ha ha! Oh, how I do love birthday cake! How I do!
