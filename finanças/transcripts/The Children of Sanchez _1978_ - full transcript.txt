(catchy music) # Without dreams # Of hope and pride # A man will die # Though his flesh still moves # His heart sleeps in the grave # # Without land a man never dreams # # Cause he's not free # All men need a place # To live with dignity # Take the crumbs from starving soldiers # # They won't die # Lord said not by bread alone does man survive # # Take the food from hungry children # # They won't cry # Food alone won't ease the hunger in their eyes # # Every child belongs to mankind's family # # Children are the fruit of all humanity # # Let them feel the love # Of all the human race # Touch them with the warmth # The strength of that embrace # Give me love and understanding, I will thrive # # As my children grow, my dreams come alive # # Those who hear the cries of children # # God will bless, oh yes he will # # I will always hear the children of Sanchez # (cheery band music) (group singing) Oh, Holy Virgin. Help me to keep my family together. I don't believe it is our destiny, the will of God they say, for us to be hungry, and poor, and bitter. Oh, Holy Virgin. Don't let me leave this life with no trace that I was ever here. This is a true story of my life and the life of my family. My father, my sister, and my two brothers. When we were little, our family had joy and love. After our mother died, our lives changed. (melancholy music) And I will try to be... A good father to the children. [Daughter] A friend of mother's who came to live with us as our housekeeper, our favorite uncle, and aunt, and my beloved grandmother all tried to take my mother's place, but everything was different. My father never really talked to us, never showed us any affection. The feeling that we were a family was gone. We grew up convinced in our hearts that our lives were worthless. (intense music) (sirens blaring) (heavy breathing) Crispin, I'm pregnant. We're gonna have a baby. We have to live together, or I'll never see you again. (door slams) (loud jeering) Can you ever pick a winner, damn it? Aw, shut up. (bell tolling) (humming) Look, there's a globe, I'll change it. (somber acoustic music) I have to buy almonds, lemons, cherries, ice cream. They sold all the ice cream. Okay. Luis, how are you? Is this your list? [Luis] Yes, okay. Is this what you need, huh? Put it in the office. Come on, help me. Good, I'll be right in there. (somber acoustic music) (knocking) [Man] Come in. Senor Gomez, if you don't mind, I would like to talk to you for a moment. Go ahead, what is it? [Man In Hat] Senor Gomez... [Gomez] Yes? Well, it's about a small raise. A very small raise. You know, you said exactly the same words to me 10 years ago. 10 years ago, yeah. I remember, it was raining. Oh yes, it was coming down. Jesus, you're one of my best workers, always. And the oldest. Uh huh. Why, it's 30 years. - Long time. - Yes sir. And now, well now my children, well I have more responsibilities, and I want to buy a house. Nice idea. Just a very small house for all my children. Well, it's the dream of my life. You're a free man, right? No, that's right, senor. But I thought, you know... You know I would like to pay you more salary, but you know the restaurant doesn't make enough money to do it, that's all I have for you. But, you find somebody who can afford to pay you more, go out and get it, Jesus. No senor, I want to stay here but... I'll be very happy for you. And we'll be friends anyway. That is what is important, right? Well, I hope I didn't disturb you, senor. And well, thank you anyway. [Gomez] You're welcome. Yes! (chickens squawking) (somber music) [Newscaster] This is Channel 24, telecasting your favorite musical programs directly from a hacienda hotel in Mexico City. We'll pause now for a brief commercial announcement. Where are my sons? They haven't come home. [Man On TV] The coming elections can change the course of history in our beloved nation. It's time for dinner. We have rights born of our great nation. We have the right to have different political parties, conflicting opinions, and public debate on all issues of government in our daily life. This time I think you should vote, Father. Vote. Who do you think they're gonna change? You know what they'll change? Chairs. Mr. Gomez you sit here, and Mr. Gonzalez, you sit there. That's what they'll change, chairs. If enough people try to improve things, that's the only way. We have to speak up! The only way not to be kicked in the ass is to know your place and keep your mouth shut. We have a right to change things. You accept everything the way it is. Consuelo. You know what you are? You're a pot who wants to get out of the kitchen, but look at yourself. You're a pot, and you'll always be a pot. You'll see. I won't be a pot forever. When I get my stewardess license... License in six months. (Chuckling) And on my money. (groaning) This is it. This time is it. I want to call the midwife. No Tapita, it's over now. It's gone. She's been having labor pains for three days now. And you know what she gets from Manuel, from her own husband? A beating. A man is a man, Consuelo. He's got the right. How can you say that, Paula? No one has the right. But you, Consuelita. You go on like you are, and you're going to be too old, alone, with nothing but your big ideas. I was here before all of you were born, but you, you're still living with your father. Woman was made to have children. As long as my belly is flat, I'm independent. I worked like a God damn horse for 16 hours a day, and I have to come home to this? God damn it, this is my house! Get my dinner. Donny, change the station. I want to see the lottery. The lottery headquarters. These are the winners. 7-2-4-8-9-6-3-7-2-0, 3-9-4-8-6-7-6-9-2-1. And the big winner of the week... Two. Son of a bitch, I never win. Eat your dinner, Papa. Use your fork, look at me. Ask your sister to stay. Good night, everybody. Why don't you stay, Delila? There's enough food for all of us. Sit down. [TV Presenter] Now we'll return you to the popular program, the Big Sounds of Mexico City at nine, top 20 record selections. Consuelo. Go and find your brother. Stewardess! You know where he is, go find him. Did you cook this? I did. Roberto, what happened? Nothing. Good evening, Papa. Who is this man? I never saw him before. He's been in a fight. Are you a Colonel? He's your son... He's not my son! My sons are clean. My sons are something special. You're a bum. Not like that, not like that, eat like a Mexican. He doesn't eat. Here. Don't listen to your Aunt Consuelo. She wants to be a gringa, you eat like a Mexican, here. (loud whistling) Mama, it's Crispin. Hey you! Come back and sit down. Even his own son can't call a man father. You're right, that man is a son of a bitch. (whistling) No! You stay right there. I'll go say hello to your lover. Who the hell you whistling at? Huh? What do you think, my daughter's some kind of a dog? You just come here and whistle at her? (loud banging) (dog barking) Son of a bitch, if he comes around again, I'm gonna kill the son of a bitch. And you get the hell out of here! Don Jesus! My best plant. [Jesus] Here's your plant. My best plant! If you see him again, I'll throw you out of the house. We broke up. I won't see him anymore. Look at my face when you say that! One of these days, I promise, I'm going to throw myself under a bus, then you will be happy! Better under a bus than in bed with that son of a bitch. (drowned out music) (laughing) (speaking in foreign language) Father wants you to come home, right now. Didn't you hear me? Two aces. You are cheating, man! (laughing) Didn't you hear me? I said father is waiting for you! Just take the money. Wait, miss. Mariquita, come on, that's enough. I'm waiting for my Aunt Consuelo. Roberto. Give Delila some blankets. Thank you, Roberto. (laughing) You sleep here. Want some water? Yeah. Something to eat? No. What kind of man are you? You don't care about anything. Your wife, your children, your sisters, your brother. Your family. I should get up and whip you, but you're not worth it. (loud brushing) (dogs barking) (melancholy music) Why the hell are you spying on me? Can I have some privacy? I was just kissing her goodnight. God damn it, I work like a slave to support all of you. Don't I deserve some happiness? Please, Mr. Sanchez. I don't want to make trouble. No, this is my house! You really want to go? No. Then you stay. If anybody doesn't like it, get the hell out! I don't depend on you, I make my own living. And this is my house too! Look! You don't tell me how to live. You get the hell out! I'm going! I'm tired, I can't stand it anymore. [Jesus] Yeah, you go. My life. And see how easy it is without me. Listening to you! Go on, who's gonna pay for your stewardess license? You criticize me, you humiliate me. Or your English lessons. The trouble with you... You prefer this woman to me! No, you think you're better than all of us! You know what you're gonna be? You're gonna be a whore, that's what you're gonna be. Whatever happens to me, it's your fault! Okay. From now on, she stays. She's my woman. Get in bed. So. (knocking) Consuelo. Come in. It's been a long time. You have left me alone. How can I look? Grandmother. I'm sorry. Can I stay here tonight? You had a fight with your father. How do you know? I know. Come, let's sit down. You tell me what's wrong. You look pale, Consuelo. He's brought another woman into the house. She's about almost 30 years younger. I turned on the light, and there they were. He looked so frightened, I even felt sorry for him. You are so alike, you and your father. You love each other, and you hate each other. I want to be on my own, I have to be! My child. Many years will go by before a woman can really be free. If God wants to help a woman, he makes her fall in love. Love? Men want only one thing from a woman. Pray to God that you fall in love, it's the most a woman can expect from life. What about you, Grandma? Were you ever in love? Yes. God was good to me. But why didn't you go with him? I am a woman, a Mexican wife, a Mexican mother. I had no right to go. Only a man has any rights. Let me tell you something I believe. A good woman, a mother, in our life has to be a very special person. She has to accept all the macho ways of our men, and still keep her dignity, still be the heart of the family, the chain which pulls the family together. Your mother was that kind of a woman. And so are you, Consuelo. And more. In you is the hope of our future. (paper crumples) What are you thinking about? Nothing. Because my life is nothing. You don't know what you're really worth. I love you. You know it. Would you leave your father's home, your job, everything for me? I would. Good morning. Good morning, Ted. Consuelo, bring me the Ramirez file please. Yes sir. (bird cawing) If you say yes, I write to my friend in Monterrey. He could find work for me. [Grandma] My child. Many years will go by before a woman can really be free. If God wants to help a woman, he makes her fall in love. Pray to God that you fall in love, it's the most a woman can expect from life. It's a dream. It could be true. Would you go right away, Mario? Now? Without ever looking back? Cucho! Hello Senor Jesus, how are you? Fine. [Cucho] Good. How are the melons? Ah, good as always. Those in front are the best ones. Where they from? They're from Morelos. Morelos? Yes. How much do they cost? Well, low special price for you, 10 pesos each. 10 pesos? No, that's too much. It's a bargain. Are the best ones I've ever had. Huh? What is it? Oh, come on, these are not from Morelos. [Cucho] Yes they are. No, no, smell them. [Cucho] But... They have no aroma, look. Look, look. They're yellow. Oh, senor Jesus, you are right as usual. [Jesus] Of course I'm right. You are a wizard. I know, I know melons. Yes, you know. I tell you what I'll do. [Cucho] What? I'll take all these. They're about 20 for half price. Half price? You don't want? Oh, that's alright. Alright, alright. Take them, they're yours. Avelino, take this whole basket. Senor Jesus! How come that you pay me back today when I have the best avocados in town? They taste like butter! Because I know, senor. You sell the best avocados to the United States, and we Mexicans, all we get is... Oh no! Yes, he's right. No, no. Yes, you're selling your goods, you send them to the States. (lighthearted music) Jesus. Don't run away, it's no use. What are you doing here? Look, I haven't seen you for two months. Now you've seen me. Say hello to your father. Look, I've told you before. He is not my son. Do you think you can keep running away? I'll make a scene right here so everybody can hear. Your boss will find out, and he won't like it. What the hell do you want from me? Money. Well, that's all you've ever wanted. Well not for me, but for your son. Look, I've told you for 11 years. He is not my son. Jesus... While you were sleeping with me, you were sleeping with that man from Jalisco. That's a lie! And that ugly man from Nogales. That's not true! One thing I've never done, I have never denied my blood. Well, he is... Alright, alright. I'm gonna give you 50 pesos. Not because he's my son, but because I have a good heart, here. Okay, you want me to show you his thing? Everybody can see it. He's got a spot on it exactly like yours. For the law, that's proof enough. It's even more proof than a blood test, it's like fingerprints, do you want me to show it to you? Come here. Excuse me, mister, excuse me. Excuse me just a minute. Please, please sir. Come on, take it out. Excuse me. Take it out. Please. Did your mother paint that on for you? No, Papa. How long have you had it? Always. Okay, button up. Jesus. I never lied to you. Here's some money. Will you make a man of him? And look, get him a haircut. Alright. (bell tolling) Lupe. Lupe! I brought you everything you wanted. Oh, thanks. Papa. Would you like to have something special before dinner? Oh, maybe a little coffee, a little tea. Which one would you like? A little tea. With two sugars, eh? [Daughter] I know, Papa. Where's Tonya? I'm here, Papa. How are you, Papa? Lupe. Lupe. Yes? Why do you let her dress like that? Well, what's the matter? Well, what do you mean what's the matter? Can't you see? Everything's showing. Well, she won't listen to me, you take care. Disgraceful. Oh, come on, come on. Don't be angry. No, no. Papa, when are you going to marry our mother? You are getting older. Me getting old, are you crazy? A man who works like me? Look. We know know you've taken Delila into your house, she could be your daughter. Look, look, look, I take to my house who I want. Old... Your mother, she's old. I slept with her when I was a little boy. Jesus, don't say those things! I was just a little boy, now she wants me to take you to the altar, maybe in a white veil. She's only a child, a girl. Anyway, what kind of a father are you? You're never around. Oh God damn it, there's no peace... Never around, it's all my responsibility... Look! Look, if things don't change, one of these days I'm gonna take away everything. I'm gonna take away the pig, I'm gonna take away the potatoes, I'm gonna take the peas I planted in the backyard, I'm gonna take away everything. Things better change. I'm gonna see the pig. I'm not coming home. I'm going away. (dog whimpers) Tell them that I went to the United States, I'll send money. Tell them... To call the baby Jesus, like his grandfather. You promise? Don't go, Papa. I don't want you to go. I love you, Papa. Go on. (somber music) (romantic saxophone music) You like it. Can't we drive on to Monterrey? You're tired, your face looks tired. Come on. (speaking in foreign language) Take the evil spirits out Jesusito. Protect him. (speaking in foreign language) (dog barking) (speaking in foreign language) Marta. Marta, give Rofalia her dinner. I'm not taking care of your child, and I'm not taking orders from you ever! Calm down. You cannot take off in a time like this. I'd rather be dead than live here anymore, Chata. You know, you will get your wish if you count on Crispin taking care of you. Crispin, he can't even take care of himself. I'm through with him, with all of them! Congratulations, Jesus. [Jesus] Thank you. Fine grandson. [Jesus] Yes. Papa. Yes? I'm leaving. You don't need me here anymore. Look, I know where you're going. Now don't you play the victim with me! Arturo, Trini, come on. Goodbye, Grandpa. Jesus. You will be left alone like a miserable dog. All your children are leaving you. Papa, don't let Marta go, please. Marta... Now you know me. You better think. You really want to go? (somber music) It's up to you. Delila, I'm hungry. How's my grandson? Hey, he's getting heavier. He's a powerhouse. Oh, hey. Look at him, he's a bull. Looks like me, no? Trini, Arturo, come on, let's go. One ticket please, to Acapulco. Your boy's big enough to pay too. 30 pesos. I don't know. I only have 27. I don't want to offend you, but if I can help... We will be happy to help you. But we don't want to offend you. Thank you. (somber music) [Man] Me or him? Don't worry, we never fight over anything, my uncle and me. Choose, choose freely Marta, huh? That ticket you gave me is very expensive. You don't have to, if you don't want to. You want to flip a coin, huh? Heads or tails. Come on, which is it? You have to know something. This isn't love. But I think I prefer Balthazar. At least there's less difference in age. Oh, you're making a mistake. Look, if I fight Balthazar, he's sure to lose. Isn't that right Balthazar, huh? Oh, yes. My uncle is right. He's only 45 years old. He looks older. (chuckling) Couldn't you take that earring off? You look like a fairy. I made a vow to wait. His mother made him do it, when he was a little boy. Uncle. Could you be so kind to turn the other way? Ugh. (chuckling) I... I can't make love with someone else in the room. Uncle? Ah. You heard what Marta said. You could have told her that I was dead, damn it, now I have to sleep outside with the dogs! Good night! (toilet flushes) (loud bang) Oh my God. This time, I missed you on purpose, just to warn you. Next time, don't ever touch my mother's picture again, don't even look at it. We were a happy family when my mother was alive. There was love in this house. But I'm going to tell your father, he will throw you out of the house. Then I'm going away, to Guatemala. I won't take it anymore. Guatemala. (Chuckling) That's very far away, Robertito. I want to get away, Grandmother. I would even go to hell. I am the one who will be going soon. But not to hell, I hope. (Chuckling) You know, just stay in bed all the time. Near the right people. And you'll get better. I won't go away, Grandmother. I'll stay here, I'll take care of you. No, Roberto. You must have your own life. I promised your mother. Anyway, I am going to die on my feet, with my fur coat on. You don't know that I have a fur coat. No. Nobody knows it. Come, look. (bell tolling) This was a gift. Now I am giving it to you, Roberto. You sell it, so you can go away. Because you have to go away, Roberto. If you stay with your father, you were never grow up. You admire him too much. (band music) Look, Grandma. It's the Air Force. (band music) Fly. If you can fly, you are free. Squad right, turn! (band music) At ease. About face! (loud whirring) [Man On Radio] The big winner for this week, this ticket is worth 100... Jesus! Jesus. Jesus... What are you doing? I told you never to come here, this is my office. Paquita is dying, Jesus. She wants to talk to you. Paquita? She's dying? [Man On Radio] Be sure you have this exact number before you come to... Jesus Christ. [Man On Radio] The winner of one hundred thou... I left my lottery tickets at home. [Man On Radio] Is number 6-6-6-4-2. I repeat, number 6-6-6-4-2. Number 6-6-6-4-2. You have just won 100,000 pesos. Oh God. My God. Jesus! Jesus, you won! You won, Jesus! (Chuckling) Jesus, your ticket! Hey! Hey, you! Jesus won 100,000 pesos on the lottery! He won, he won! (laughing) (loud commotion) [Woman] What is the matter, Jesus? He just won 100,000 pesos at the lottery! (laughing) 100,000 pesos? Yes! Jesus won 100,000 pesos at the lottery! Come on, Jesus. Jesus, sit down. (nervous laughing) Jesus. You're a rich man, Jesus. You're a rich man! (lighthearted music) I am? Yes. A rich man. Yeah! Paquita. Jesus. Think about your children. I always think about my children. You and I both know how you made them all run away. Think with your heart, Jesus. Please. For their sake, and their mother's. Don't wait until it's too late. Paquita. Jesus won 100,000 pesos at the lottery. 100,000. Paquita, Jesus is a novel man. You will see, he will remember us. We who are so poor. I owe six months rent. Nacho. Jesus. Jesus? Paquita. You must make peace with Consuelo. She's the one that's more like you. Stay close to her, Jesus. I love my children. All of them. But they must never know, otherwise they will take advantage of me. Paquita. Paquita, now you know life is hard. When I'm gone, they must know how to survive. You're too hard on them, Jesus. Ask yourself what you have really looked for all your life. Underneath your machismo, underneath everything, haven't you wanted love? Isn't it what we all want in this life? Show them you love them. Tell them. I will try. Find Consuelo. Give her this. (somber violin music) Tell her... She's my hope. I will. Paquita. You're a great lady, and I've always respected you. But I don't think you've always understood me. In the beginning, I knew I was different from you and your family, and I never felt I was good enough for your daughter. But I always took care of her. Paquita. Paquita. I did love her. Now... Now with this ticket I can take care of you. Look. 100,00 pesos. Paquita. Nacho. Mama? Mama? (somber music) (lighthearted music) I messed you. Me too. What are we having for dinner? I'm starving. Mario, do you really love me? You know I do. What's the matter with you today? Nothing. I'm just realizing how much you mean to me. It's taken a long time, but I guess this is what I've always wanted, a home, a family. Mario, we're going to be a family. Really? Are you sure? Yes. I thought you'd be happy. Of course I'm happy. I love you. I love you too. (lighthearted music) (loud horn music) Do you know where you're standing? On a hill? On my land. Yours? I bought it. With the lottery. My father, my grandfather, I never had a piece of land. I'm the first. I'm gonna build my house right here, so me and my children, and my grandchildren will always have a roof over our heads. And I'm gonna build a wall all around, so nobody will bother us, and for protection, in case I fall down and can't get up again. That will never happen, you're as strong as a bull. Anyway, I can't afford to die now. I have to build my house. With your permission, I want to make it a home for you. (dog barking) Can you accept all my children? All of them. And the women? They were part of your life. You know, every room, every room is going to have a window, and I'm gonna build two toilets. Why two? I wish my father and my grandfather, and Leanor, and Paquita could see this. They would be proud. (calming acoustic music) Taste it. Huh? It's good land. Just look. Oh, senor. A beautiful baby with your eyes and his mouth. Senor Mario is a handsome man. Are you sure you want to do this? Yes. I'm sure. Go to bed. (bird cawing) Don't be afraid. This will hurt a little. (groaning) Oh. It's finished now. There. It's over now, you were very good. (whistling) Oh, Mario's here. Don't move, you should stay quiet for a couple of hours. But he'll know! Remember, you fell, you hit your belly, you called me. But now give me my money. Let me give you your shot, and then we'll be finished. What happened? She fell right on her belly, so she sent for me, and I took care of everything. But now you better leave her alone, she needs to rest. You had an abortion. Our son. You have a son. And a wife. It's all here in this letter. It was all a lie. You never loved me, I won't have a child without a name. No son of mine is going to take a second place, and second place is not good enough for me either! (somber acoustic music) Papa! I thought I threw you out. You don't belong anywhere. It was my fault, Papa. It's always your fault. Not always. They teach you to kill, I don't want to kill nobody. I want to be a man. A man like you. They're looking for you. They think I've crossed the border. I came home the long way. Are you gonna stand there, or are you gonna help? It's beautiful. Give me a brick. (heavy breathing) Are you through already? Hm? Are you through already? Yes, I'm through. Thank you. Thank you very much. But you're not even halfway. Well, that's your problem. I'm through. Absolutely. Because you don't love me anymore. Come on. That's not it. I don't know, just doesn't work the way it used to. You work too hard, you don't have to finish this house this year. No, I... Finish it next year. No, no, no. I'm gonna finish it this year. (catchy jazzy radio music) (knocking) Father. Why did you bring your father into this? She needed money. I didn't know about it. I will pay you back. I love your daughter. Consuelo. Do you love him? Do you want to stay with him? The bus leaves in one hour. I'll wait out here, five minutes. You decide. (door slams) I'm going, Mario. Please don't go. Have faith in me. The lie was too big. I don't know you! (door slams) (relaxing music) Well senor, when you came here, that truck was already half full. Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll give you half now, and half later. [Truck Owner] Alright, let's go. Marta! Marta, get the kids! Come on, help load. [Balthazar] Can I help you? I can't see, I can't see. To the left! Which left, over here? The right! Come on. Come on, everybody load up. What's this for? Because I missed you. Okay, let's pack. (uplifting music) I know it wasn't much of a place for your daughter, but at least we ate everyday. In my house, we eat everyday too. And pretty soon, we're gonna have a new place, with windows, a window in every room. I hope I see it. Maybe you will. Look... Look, I have to ask you something. Anything. Are you one? One what? You know, one of those? Those what? Are you a fairy? Why? Well, that earring. (laughing) It's a vow. My mother posed me to make it when I recovered from my typhus fever. I was worried. (laughing) I'm not a fairy. You never know nowadays. Ah come on, senor Jesus. Well, anyway I'm glad. (laughing) (uplifting music) (rooster crows) Hey. Come on in. Manuel, I have to tell you something. Son, Paula's dead. I know, I know, I know. (dreamy sleepy music) You're gonna keep on running. God damn it, son. When are you going to stop with me? You're a man now. Think about your children. I won't let you leave! Son, you'll have to kill me first. (sobbing) No, Papa, no, no, no. No, God. (sobbing) I've can't stop her. I can't hold her any longer. I don't know what to do with her. She needs a stronger hand than mine. Oh, Virgin of Guadalupe, help us. Oh, the Virgin has nothing to do with it. It's your fault, she was your responsibility. Hello, Grandfather! Oh, stop it! (laughing) There she is. Wait here. Well, I don't know. I'm tired. Come here. Hey, I like seniors, I'll give you a discount. Good looking, have a drink with me. Come on, let's dance. What the hell do you think you're doing to my daughter? Hey, wait! Don't worry, I would like to marry you. Don't worry man. (loud commotion) - You'd marry her? - Yes. You're a pimp, not a husband! Don't worry! - Don't worry? - No problem. You son of a bitch. (suspenseful uptempo music) Watch out, watch out. Come on, come on, wake up everybody. Well this is Tonya, and she's gonna stay here a couple of days. Oh, by the way, she's my daughter. Hello. [Roberto] Hey, you can sleep here. (toilet flushes) What are you doing, you dumb son of a bitch? She's your sister! (celebratory music) (clapping) (celebratory music) (loud screaming) How do you like it, Delila? Consuelo? (uptempo music) Papacito bought this for me, the slippers too. (chuckling) (laughing) Get out, get out! (laughing) I made you pay for all the years you have given the orders in this house, now I come first! I sold the pigs. Now I can finish the house. You know, today I put in the toilet. You want to come and see the house? What for? What's that supposed to mean? Father, I want to talk to you. About what? I've been waiting all day for you. Maybe I shouldn't have come back here. I don't think I can live in this house anymore, unless we can talk. As two grown people, Father. Okay, talk. I understand about Delila. I've gone through a lot of things, and I've changed. I know you have to have your own life, we all do. Well, I'm glad you understand. And I've been worried, God damn it, she should be here when I come home! Well... Is that what you wanted to say? No. Father... I love you. We all love you. But you don't love us. So, I don't love you. Maybe you don't even realize it. [Jesus] What don't I realize? That you're always humiliating us. What you've done for Tonya in a few days, what you haven't done for us in a lifetime. I've always fed you, have you ever gone hungry? No, you've always given us bread, a roof, but do you know why I ever left this house? Because you forced me to. And do you know what I always wanted to be, Father? A nun. I always wanted to enter a convent, but I couldn't, because you never gave me your name. But Tonya, you'd give her your name right away. I'm sure of that. Yes, I'll give her my name, maybe I'll give her fur coats and jewels, and maybe I'll give her a limousine. Father, do you know what they're saying? The whole village? [Jesus] What are they saying? That you're in love with your own daughter. That you want to go to bed with her. God, that's filthy. You dirty bitch! Don't touch me! I... You can have your Tonya, and all the other women you want, but I'm leaving, and as far as I'm concerned, you're dead, dead! (glass breaks) Dead!

(catchy theme music) (screaming) You filthy pig! (screaming) Don't be afraid. I brought you to a hospital. No one can hold three jobs like yours and keep going. But you're going to be fine. How long have I been here? Two weeks. And you must be here one more. I have good news for you, Consuelo. I talked to the airline today, you passed your examinations, you're a stewardess now. Dear God. I'm free. (celebratory horn music) Roberto, come and see. Seen it, Papa. It's beautiful. You finished it. Casa Jesus Sanchez. You should be proud. We should have a party. Maybe we'll celebrate. Come on, I'll show you. Look. Eh? What about that? All this, just for you. For me? No, for you, your wife, and your children. Thank you. I'm going to look for a wife outside of Mexico City. You'll find the same hoes all over the world. Look at this. Hey, the water. Go on, go on, feel it. It's beautiful water, Papacito. No, no, let it run. No, I've got plenty, come on. This is Marta's and the kids. Nice. You know, I wish Balthazar would take off that God damn earring. He can't. Why not? He promised God. What do you think, God is watching an earring? Eh, this is your brother's. Which one? Come on, don't be funny. Manuel's, and the kids. Manuel went back to work. Since when? This morning. Eh, he will last until tomorrow. We must help him, Papa. I've been helping him since he was born. I help everybody, nobody helps me. Come here. Look at that. Go on, go and try it. [Roberto] It works! Sure it works, I put it in. Come here. This is the best room in the house. Look, the toilet. [Roberto] Two toilets! Yeah. Look at that view. Whose room is this? It was supposed to be Consuelo's. Do you know that your sister's a whore? That's not true, Papa. I saw her. With my own eyes. (somber music) Okay. (somber music) (dog barking) Selena. We're moving. Santiago! Santiago! [Santiago] Yes! I'm going! [Santiago] Goodbye! Bye. Arturo! Arturo! Is that the way you work? Look, when you start something, you finish it. Be a man. Come on, finish it. Papa. Well, what is this? This is my wife. I just got married. I said I owed you, so here I am. My name is Marimba, senor Jesus. I am honored to become part of the family. Roberto, I'll talk to the bride. Chucho, go get a drink. Haven't I seen you someplace? I feel the same way about you, senor Jesus. I always remember faces. I can't remember where. Of course. Tentero Street. You're a prostitute. I'm not ashamed, senor Jesus. I have to take care of my mother, my father, and a crazy aunt. Are you making a fool of my son? He knows, I told him the truth. (singing in foreign language) Come on everybody, I have gifts for everybody. Marta, Tata, come out! This is for the babies? - Yes! - Good! Delila, this is for you! And this is for you. Come on, I just got married. - Really? - Yes! That's it. Come, come visit my family. Marta, my sister Marta, my wife. Hello, hello. And this is Tata. Isn't she beautiful? Beautiful! This one is the youngest one of us. Jesusito. The little sausage. Listen, everybody! I'd like to make a toast to my wife! You make me very happy. You do. Drink. (singing in foreign language) Hello. Arturo. You missed a place, right there. Papa. Papa. I know all about it. And now she's my woman. It's your life. You see, finished. What do you get, Jesus? She's a very good singer like Consuelo. Lupita, keep the kids quiet. Hey! Come on Marta, sit down. [Woman] Hello Marta. [Marta] Hello. Delila, I said sit down. You, go sit over there. Delila, sit down here. Hey listen, all of you listen to what I say. He's gonna make a speech. No, no, no, look, I don't want to make a speech, I just want to say something. I built this house for my family, and, well, you're all my family. Even you, Marimba. And, well, three are missing, but they'll be sorry. You know, when I built this house, I was hoping things would change, but I know you'll go on fighting like cats and dogs. (laughing) But anyway, we'll be together. And, well I want to say that, when a man owns his own home, he can say here to the rest of the world. (laughing) (clapping) Bravo! Alright, come on, let's eat. Give me the chicken. Thank you good Lord, for this beauti... What Lord? I built this house with my own hands. And who made your hands? Everybody! Everybody has to pray before we eat! God damn it, will you all shut up? She wants to pray. Shut up, let her pray! Thank you, Jesus. Well go ahead, pray. Thank you good Lord, for your heart which is full of love. Did you finish? Yes, I finished. Why didn't you say so? Come on, eat everybody. Come on, comer. Ah, the chicken! Give me the mole! We need some rice for the kids here! (singing in foreign language) Consuelo. [Man] Hello Consuelito, sit down. Father. I can do a lot for Mariquita. I can send her to the best school there is, where she can study. You know I love her, like she were my own child. I want to adopt her, Father. What you came here for? You can go back. Mariquita, go in the house! Now you please tell me, why the hell are you here? What did you think I came here for? To wash your feet, like Christ? I thought maybe you came to... I'm not your slave anymore, I'm a free woman. You're not gonna treat me like a dog anymore. He makes you all pay plenty, for the little food he gives you. Shut up! Why don't you just shut up, or I'm gonna whip you in front of all these people, now you God damn it, just... - No! - Papa, no! Consuelo, get back! You all defend him! Leave me alone. Poor man, he needs you to defend him. And the woman have sucked him in! (loud screaming) Hit me! Go on, hit me! Papa! Papa! (loud screaming) You're old. You know why he always hit us? Because he knew, he knew that we weren't his children. Isn't that right, Aunt Guadalupe? You know and Manuel knows. What the hell did you say? Consuelo. No, I don't... I know nothing! You slut! Get out! You slept with every woman... You too, get the hell out! You bastards! You eaten my food, you've taken my money, and you knew, you bastards! You knew you weren't mine. Bastards. Get in the house, go on! You're probably a whore too! Oh, Jesus. They are your children. I swear. They are your children. Father. Forgive me. I only wanted to... To hurt you. Of course we are your children. There's so much of you in all of us. We're proud that you're our father. But Father, I think a family should talk. Understand. Really love each other. That's all we've got. Any of us. Father, I love you. Do you love me? (sobbing) Family. Christ... I hate it. I don't know how. I don't know how.
