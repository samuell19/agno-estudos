Gotta keep our head boys, don't lose it now We've come too far. Stay alert. We stay sharp. We're gonna get through this. - Alright? - Alright. We'll be fine, we just have to do what we know. Look at me. Look at me! We'll be in pub tomorrow night having a bloody beer, right? What the people of yours? If they had better come with me. Let's go. Hold! Advance man and be recognized! - Easy...easy, boy. - Don't shoot. - We're British. - Oh bloody hell, we're glad to see you long. - Anybody got smoke? - Identify yourself. The 3 Little Pigs. Don't get old slack with me. Unit. 2 Platoon. B Company, West Kent, sir. Where is your platoon commander? Dead, sir. - Platoon sergeant? - Dead. I would appreciate to give us some eat, some days my men do not eat. No, but I have a job for you. Report to the company Sergeant-Major. We're digging in. Maybe ambush these bastards. Ambush? Do you know what's coming? Don't you dare to question me, Corporal. - Is this the way off Dunkirk? - No, you're digging in. I have orders to hold line, and we will hold the bloody line. Orders are orders. And I was given orders. And I'm giving you an order. What sort of soldier are you? I wish you luck and all dare. But we're going to Dunkirk. Those were the last orders given us by our sergeant. Or you stay right here and you will fight or I have you arrested. For now, we have finished fighting. Let's go, boys. - Sgt. - Corporal! - Calm down. - What do you do? - Put it down. - We are on the same side. Easy boy Come on. Live to fight another day. You ain't gonna stop these bastards now. - You stay and we're gonna make it, believe me. - You're deserters, don't you? Bloody cowards...I should have you shot. Arrest these men. - Thank you. - Come on, Sophie. The Major: what he's like? Typical royal navy marine. Rough, tough and quite handsome, actually. A quite unconventional officer, actually. Some say it has Lucky to be Major. But I was investigating and father has a great story. He fought all over the world, including the pole. It has been part of operations special since 1939. Good morning, ladies. Many stories to tell. Sounds familiar? - Sophie. - Yes? - Have you ever loved? - What does that mean? Major. Come in. Splendid, Jack. What's up to you? Steiner. Thanks, Lindsey. - I guess that has been introduced. - No. - But that manner. - Sorry. Mayor Jones, this is Lieutenant Mortensen. And of course, both know Holbrook. Please take a sit. Thank you. I thought you had lost interest in this war. In fact, I'm not. I moved to Boston when I was 14 years old. It is hard to not interested in this fight. Mortensen, has agreed to help out. - Unofficially, of course. - Call it an investment interest. If you want to see some action. Jack, I'm afraid your instructor position will be revoked. I'm on operation? Operation Grendel. - What do you know RDF? - RDF? - It relates to the defence. - It stay for range and direction finding. It is part of the line of defence we've adopted along our coastline. - Radar, is it? - Quite right. The technology is what can make us win this war. The problem is: Jerry has it too. Use radar to reach their objectives, while our guys are still navigating by compass in the bloody stars. The disaster occurred in December 39, was due to our soldiers were detected at 75 miles from the German coast by RDF. They're building these things from Norway to southern France. The German RDF known as Freire and this is the Freire research center, here, in the mountains. We believe, if they have the new technology, it will be here. The admiral allowed me to set up a commando unit. Smaller, more versatile ready party. What I need from you is to infiltrate one of these Freire stations cause as much chaos as you can and get the intelligence back intact. We have one window, an opportunity. Officially, even don't exist as a unit. I need to know that you are with us for that. How many men do I have? One eight men team of specialists. I fear that were sanctioned, I'm afraid... but we only have six weeks. Any longer than that will risk any chance of nightcover I need any maps, any photographs and all the intelligence you can. - Mortensen, you know this area? - I know the terrain. It is very harsh. I used to camp in the mountains when I was a kid. Good. You can help to instruct the team. I need these men. Brightling is in prison, but we need him. I see. I'll make a call. Major. They are together, you know. A couple. I do not think that should stop him. How is Grace? Give birth at any time. Splendid. My mother should have joined you a lot. It's for the best. - I do not want you in London. - Yes, it is the best. It's always for the bloody best. Is it right or to the left, I always forget? It's left. What happened to the instructor's post? - Grace, I never said I was going to stop... - You said you'd be an instructor. Grace, please. Don't make this harder than it already is. Jack, please. How many fatherless children there will be when this war is done? I want yours to know you. You are here because you are scam. Have disappointed everyone. Yourself. You units, your king and your country. I'm here to put you right, to put you back on track. You will not go without understanding what means to be a decent human being. Not a coward, deserter thief or rapist. Eyes forward. What if I say not? Alone. Who's this one? Soldier Reines, sir. Soldier Reines. Strucking an officer, disobeyed orders, cowardice. Shall I go on? You are a bloody disgrace. It was a mistake. I should be gone back to the West Kent. Save your speech for your court-martial. Why did you join the army, son? - You wanted to see the world? - It was either that or go to prison, dad. You will increase the charges. Damn stop giving orders, sir. Are you okay? Speaking of brave, and see who jumps. Sergeant, the hill, one hour. Full weight, go. Go go go. You are stupid. You are nothing. Move your asses. Get up. Move. I have a heart attack. Follow the group. Damn! - Rot alone, damn worm. - I cannot breathe. You do not need help. He is special. Aren't you, Brightling? He is a commando, isn't it? Yes. Come on. Is it not true, you fucking bastard? Let go, I'll show you. I cannot move the damn legs. Come on. I'm not disappointed. You two, take the pole. So you were commando. No, I wasn't. How was it? I heard about you boys. I never knew you existed. I thought it was propaganda, you know that. If we can get out of here. Escape. I have got something, cooking. We can get out of here. Change the names. Become commando and kill those fucking Nazis. Trust me. I know what I mean. Serious. I'm a commando, man. - Major Jones. - Colonel. I got a call from the guards. Good. So ... - Something big for today. - Strictly routine. - I came to pick up one of my men. - That's right, Brightling. I think he's doing some exercise. What do you think they do, damn lazy? Follow the step. Corporal. Brightling needs an encouragement. What the hell is it? - Segeant Major! - Leave him alone. Shit. Water. What the bloody hell have you done to him? Marsh. Are you okay? - Stay away. - Take off. He was helping him, idiots. Let him go. What's your name? - Bob Reines, West Camp, sir. - Pick up this kitten and follow me. - Do you take him away? - Yes. Room for one more? What are you doing here? - A misunderstanding, sir. - I didn't ask for excuses. Strucking an officer and cowardice. But I am no coward the officer, he deserved it. - Get me out, please. - I'm afraid not. Alright, Syd, here we go. Head down, head down. Major...terribly sorry about your man. Good luck. Get back in row, Reines. - Please Major, I want to be a commando, sir. - Sorry, not this time. Reines, get back in line. - I hope you do well. - I'm wasted here. Can you control your man? The entire day has been a total embarrassment. Yes, sir. Commando is a special breed, you always have a chance. As you go out, you find us. Reines. Go to hell. Hold on to that man. He tries to escape. Get back. - Don't be stupid, son. - Don't be stupid...I'm not. The Major is taking me out of here, right now. - He will not. - I think I might, Sergeant Major. Now why don't we all calm down? I'll drive you out. Don't try anything silly. Get in the car. Get into the car Major. Get back in line you faggots. See you, boys. I'll shoot you! Right, I'm out, I found ya, I want to be a commando. Just like that? - You said that. - I know what I said. - You gave me a note. - I didn't. But I prompted. Syd, said he had something cooking. He said he had something cooking? So you thought it was a signal to do this. What? I'm a fool. You bloody stupid! I should return you back just for that. If you take me back I'm a dead man. - You seen many action? - France, just before Dunkirk. - What you think to? - A bloody carnage. - And you climb? - Like a monkey. Right. Look after Syd, he's dehydrated. Sips of water, little and often. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - Not yet a commando, yet. - No. If you fail any part of this test,you go straight back to the prison, do you understand? Yes, sir. - How do we pass the police? - I don't know If you pull over me a gun again will be a dead man. You have cold blood, you know, boy? Stop what you are doing and follow me. Rep?rtense, move. Come here quickly. Stand to attention. Good morning, gentlemen. It's good to see you here. Go ahead, Sergeant. To my right here is the Sergeant Grey. I'm Sgt McKensy . You can call me, Mac Most of you already know me. Those that don't be prepared for a big fucking surprise. - Do not look ahead, Gable. - Aye, sir. - I like your moustache, laddie. - Thanks, Sarge. I hope we had a great time. Gentlemen, after I'm finished with you, you wish had never been born. Do not underestimate me. And never fuck with me. - Do I make myself understood? - Yes, sergeant. - I can't fucking hear you! - Yes, sir. It is vital that we move quickly and covertly as a team. - Look at the man beside you. - Look at him. Get to know him. You will eat with him, you will shave with him and you will piss with him. You'll trust him for life. Right. Let's try for our first tactic of attack. Squadron underway. Come on, get moving. Come on Reines. - Hit him. - Dale hard Time. Okay, Gable. The moustache is perfect. Move, get moving. Reines, you're last. You lost. You lost the game. Move your asses. Move! In a line, in a line. Get in line. Stand down. Go back in line. The FS commando knife. This was designed especially for what you have in mind. Why? Close quarter combat. But only if we have to. Get used to this. Keep it on all the time. Sergeant Mac Come on. Topson. To the range. Come on, today please. Riley, to the range. Mortensen, to the range. Gable, to the range. Brightling, to the range. Come on son I haven't got all day. Come on Reines. This what. You need to learn how to use this. Aye...let's start with the pistol. Look at it: 9 mm, automatic. Favoured by officers and you can see why. Two shots to the main body mass, one to head to finish the job. Any questions? No? Good. Mr. Mortensen, be my guest. Good. Riley. Good shooting, son. If you weren't so fucking ugly I'd kiss you. Who taught you to shoot so well, son? - You did, Sergeant. - Me? Never. - "You did, Sergeant". - What are you talking about? Mr. Reines. If you need a door back, I'll give you a call. Sorry, Sarge. It is my weak side. Reines. Where did you learn to shoot so well? - Cowboy movies. - Oh, really? God...Have we Jessie James here, have we? Well Mr. Reines, for being so fucking funny, I think you deserve a little run, don't you? Don't you, Sergeant Grey? Put it over your head, sir. Above. Follow me sir, come on. Shut up! Lift the arms Reines. Yes Sergeant. Is it painful son? Yes, sir. Pain, Reines, it's just weakness leaving the body, son. Step forward. Stand up! What do you think they teach you? Discipline. - Something you have an adversion to. - Sir, I ... Shut up. I'm talking! I mean, what is your problem? well? - Nothing, sorry. - Sorry? Sorry. So you seem to say. What's wrong? Your mother didn't love you enough? Is that it? Were you disappointed? - You became a bully? - No. - Do not do it again. - You're right you won't I'll send you back. No! Sir. - Give me one good fuckin reason why shouldn't. - Because if. Because what? Because? Because I've done more and achieved more here than in my entire life. Reines, you haven't achieved damn anything here. One more chance. Please. How you equip yourself in the next few days will determine how you judge for the rest of your life. - Depends on you. - Thanks. - Sergeant Grey. - Thanks sir. Thank you, sir. Top with your head, Reines. Well, looks official. Come on, we review internal 5 min. Come on. Okay, let's do it. Mr. Reines, exit please. - What's up, Sergeant? - Just wait here laddie. - Come on, Sergeant. - Hello. After you Rest, soldier. So...you are my escaped convict, are you? - Can't you speak? - Yes, sir. I am. I did, sir I want he back. It's a bloody mess. - Some people want your head. - Sorry, sir. If these were past, the major Jones would be court-martialed And you would be shot. But these are extraordinary times. And major Jones is an exceptional leader. You're in luck. I persuaded her to let you stay in this operation. - Thank you, sir. - Don't thank me. - I won't leave you down. - No you won't. I'd rather either not take notes. Gentlemen, we are the masters of our own fate. Or at least it should be. For this reason, I like many others, have been exploring innovative ideas to destroy the enemy. I need men like you men with courage and honour. Indeed we live in a age of honour. With the honour comes duty. And sacrifice. We're not naive to death. But you are the first of a new breed. A special force. An elite smashing grab unit working behind the enemy lines. This trade and its success will define all future operations. Major. Operation Grendel, Norway. That's where we head to. Now, this tower and many like them are protecting our shores are known as RDF. Jerry also has the RDF, the name is Freire. Instruments that spotting out our ships and aircraft miles away. And giving Luftwaffe an advantage. Our mission: infiltrate and occupy Norway. Assaulting a communication station in the mountain range in the north. I say assault because Jerry spoke for demolition job but this is a secondary aim, the primary purpose of this mission is to get out of their hands latest generation of RDF technology. Sergeant Ballright, you explain. Good morning. The basic operating principle of RDF is very simple. The volume of sky to be kept under surveillance is literally flood lit with our RAF pulse energy. The backscattered pulses or...echoes of all aircraft within facility receives a group of posts in the ground stations that are received by a set of cross... Ballright ... In English, please. The kit that the Major was referring to, is the latest, most advanced technology we've seen in the world to date. Where I work we're developing an equipment that can jam signals from the radio towers. However, we believe they have developed anti-jamming device. So our work is completely redundant. If they have it, I need to see it with my eyes. Analyze it and steal its technology. Thank you. Sergeant Ballright, the accompany you on your excursion. Treat him with kindness. Down to details. I was informed that we have a contact with an agent. We have reported the operation but we will keep contact to a minimum. Insertion by plane. It will be a tactical landing. The aircraft will fly the engines off. A parachute drop, maybe considered if the weather it takes. - Extraction by sea. - So ... - Any questions? - Our position. General details, a fifth alpine division is in the region. We'll have to ask Beowulf the exact numbers of the objectives. But it's unlikely to be more than a platoon. - Are they any good sir? - Yes, very. So are we. - They're not expecting us. - Exactly. I have to go back to London. Leave to Ballright here to come aquainted. I wish you Godspeed. And good luck. Okay lads, we have much to do, outside. You too, Mr. Ballright. Looks like we're gonna teach you how to shoot. I know how to shoot. Get out of your fancy dress and you can show us how is done. Down your head. You were right with him, though. It's a clever man. Seems to know much about the RDF setup. The Magnetron. We must be careful with Jerry. Very good. Steiner. May I help you? I just wanted to give this to commander Fleming. Of course. I wondered if you could give this to ... I will make sure that she receives it. These are the men wills in the event of ... I want last thing, Jack. Beowulf's gone dark Make sure there?s nothing to worry about. Reines. Tell me, Boss. I want you to look out him. No problem. Please, don't snatch. Three shots each time. Again. I researched a bit, Reines. Study your records. You brought your men back. Why don't you tell me this? I did my best. Yes. We propose for a medal. You never get it, of course. Don't be afraid, Mr. Ballright. Keep him close at all times once we're on the ground. Three shots and stops. He is the nephew of someone important. If this operation fails We know what will. - Yes, I guess. - Really? Yes, a babysitting job: simple. If it looks like he's going to be captured. Or if he is...you shoot him. By the way ... you deserve this. Sir. Very good. Major Jones You don't have to worry about me. I won't slow you down. I've already had some training. Actually, I applied to join a commando unit once... But they didn't want me. It seems that my talents lies elsewhere. - I just wanted to do my bet. - You're certainly doing your bet. Good to have you on board. This is Bob Reines. He will watch your back on the ground. - Delighted. - A pleasure. Short burst...more control, great accuracy. Let's go through it again. We meet with agent Beowulf on the ground at... 3267678. We landed in a disused warehouse. - Enemy forces: - 5th alpine. That's easy, sir. Mission: Storming the enemy communication center to 277,890. Protect air infiltration and extraction. Go to the control room, lay diversion charges along the way. Secure the equipment inside the base Freire. Shoot loads. Ensure intelligence inside the Freire heart. And if you ladies manage to do this without awaken the commandant... then we should be moving to 277995... to watch the fireworks. We return to the trailer, then the submarine and back home. Aye...hug the kids and get some rest. We leave tomorrow night. 15 minutes. Go! Go! Come on. React. How many more are there? What is your mission? - Are you okay? - I thought I was going to be shot. So do I. What is this? Boss. Gable? Broken neck. - Have you had contact? - No, all clear. Our problem is this. We should be on the other side of this bloody lake. Now, we lost most of our kids and, I'm afraid, the radio is out of service. Well gentlemen, we still have a trailer. Let's move in double time. Next stop. Mortensen, Reines. - Riley - Yes? - Keep an eye We'll be allright. I'll take good care of him. Beowulf is beyond that spare Remember, codeword: Grendel. - Response? - Viking. Any sign of trouble straight back here. We will see when it's clear. What is it? It could be a patrol. Let's give him a minute. Say it. Say it! Viking. - You are late. - It's a little girl. I already knew. Put the gun down. Enough, Steiner. Never ever point at me ever again. Not once. Where are you from? How am I supposed to call you? Beowoulf? Call me, Jensen. ok Jensen, I'm Steiner, and he is Bob. Hi. Ok? - And where's the rest of you? - On their route. - Jones, combined operations. - Jensen, welcome to Norway. - Shall we discuss about orders or you need to...? - First I need you to contact London. - We've lost a lot of kit...the radio, you do have radio? - Yes. Of course. - May you update the objective? - Yes the Germans are busy. They're travelling in the mountains shooting all what they believe is the resistance. What's this? That's hat..SS They've been here for a month. I told them in London. - What shall I tell them? - Tell this ... Dispatch here arrived, sir. Not good news I'm afraid. Damn. Send the trailer. Will not make it. Sir. I need your response. Pursue it. - I need you to confirm numbers. - 20 to 30 trips at the centre daily. Plus some naval radio operators. As you know, the approach road is covered of heavy machinegun post here. They also set up a lookout tower, just east of this. Right, Mac, get on to that. Inside the huts they said you had intelligence on this. Michael was killed trying to get that information. - How long from here? - 6 hours and 12 min, at pass. This property is half km south of the target. - It's in the valley ... - I know. But can we continue to have it? We need ammo, explosive. - I have some hidden there, yes. - Good. I'm extracted with you tomorrow night. - Why? - Orders. - She is not Beowoulf. - You might be right. We may be leading a patrol. - This is insane. - He managed to contact London. She's not Beowoulf. I do not care who he is. She's helping us. She compromised us I'll put a bullet through myself. Stay alert. Hi. Come on. So the SS patrols are haunting here. What do you mean by SS? She's compromised. - Where is the rest of your team? - Hiding or dead. Why do not you tell us you were compromised? What difference would it make? Is this supplies, no? - Who are you? - Steiner, what are you doing? This girl will kill us. You're not Beowoulf, right? Are You? Are you? Now tell me, Fuck! He promised me that he would take me to England. - What his story? - She's been out with Mr. Beowoulf. Rather they were dating. Anyway, they get scrumbled, they sent the SS and he goes on his own. And she keeps trying to transmit like Beowoulf, no? - Why do that? - It's an important mission, right? That's right. That stupid cow thought we cheat and knew the situation So we just leave it like that. Allright, ladies, shut the fuck up. Jensen, a word. Regardless of who you really are - You've fullfilled your order. - Thank you, sir. The mission continues. I need you to head off now to the first trailer. Tell to London now where we are. And we are in place. Confirm the extraction coordinates. And you wait for as long as you can. I want you to get in the submarine with or without us. You're Beowoulf until London, you understand? What do I tell them in London? You tell them the truth. Right lads, gathering. The new teams. Brithling Mortensen with me. The job is the same. Mac and his team will move to the Freire. Set charges and move to us. My team will move to the communication room. Mac, we need a lot of noise to distract these bastards. Riley, stay up as long as possible. Ballright, quick as you can: in and out Right...heads down and see you in the trailer. Charges. I'll go make some noise. It ends now. The bloody tower should be blown up. Brightling. - Let's go to the Major. - I'll stay, see you in the trailer. More noise. Reines. Are you done yet? This place is full of secret treasures of the enemy. We're talking precision RDF. Give me your knife, Major. That's incredible. Technical manuals, recordings freire operations. That's great Ballright, but we shall get moving. Reines leave here. Steiner, go, go! Well, come on. Take your weapon. No bullets. No fire. - We are going to split. - Allright, we are in the trailer. Please contact the hills. - What happened to Brightling? and Riley? - Didn't make it. Right, come on. Let's move, move! Sir, is Beowoulf. Grendel destroyed. Casualties. Trailer not possible. Standby 12 hours in the designated place. Operator. Naval strategic command, please. - Strategic Command. - SOS special ops. Pick up required. Urgent. - What proceed? - Grendel. Please hold. Thank you. - Is Steiner alive? - I don't know. - Special ops. - Yes, need priority pick up. Tonight, at 2000 hours, Alpha from North, operation Grendel. It's not possible, I'm afraid. Listen to me. This is a top priority extraction. Send a bloody sub. Sir, we already sent a pick up. If there is a window, the slightest window of opportunity. We'll see. Sir. Tell Viking. Naval pick up not possible. Make your way to Sweden. Should we let the Major Jones knows the news? Yes, of course. Born the daughter of Sara. Both doing well. What's the latest? The Major's got a baby girl. Good job. Pick up cancelled. We to leave ourselves. - Allright, where to? - Sweden. - It will be rough. - But we got here. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Major. We are on foot to Sweden. They are 2 or 3 days walk. - We need supplies. - The farm? - We promised we would not. - Is there another farm? We will need more than fucking food. Why we do what we came for? - It's a very good idea. - Allright, let's move. Come on, all is well. You've done good there. I've never killed anyone before. I thought it would be harder. - It all happened so quickly. - Listen to me. Better them than you. Well done. Do not think about that or you'll go insane. People die, it happens. Now come on, pick up that gun and be proud. Mac takes this. Steiner and Reines: with me. - Did you see the blood out there? - Yes. Oh fuck. Reines, crouch. What do you see? Reines, what do you see? Fuck. It's Brightling. We need to help him. Steiner and Mac could cover it. No, crouch. Get down. Damn bastards. Fucking animals. Germans bastards. They're fucking animals. Would be wise to show yourselves. Friendly farmers no longer available for trading. I have your friend. I think he'll be very happy to see you. Won't shoot if you come out now. Your friend will continue to suffer until you do. They have to Syd. Mac, what do we do? Mac? Take it easy. Allright, Know that we parted. They will be watching for us. Stay low. Miss, take this. Are you going just sit and watch your friend suffer? Now would be a very good time to come. We have to go. - We can not, we can not leave. - She's right. Very good. Enough. Listen. Assume firing position. Fucking animals. Single shots. Conserve your ammo. Cover me down the stretch. When you get out, either they are dead or not, you're gonna fuck off to Sweden. - Mac, I can stay. - I have no time for this, son. - Make sure you take it. - Of course. Okay, do it. Damn. Mac Ceasefire. You should be in Sweden, Mckensy. With all due respect, sir. But fuck off. Do they expect? Ceasefire. - Ballright is safe. - No way out. You have no chance to escape. Go, go. Are you enjoying this? - Go. - Shut up. What do you want me to do with this, sir? - Go. - You'll be prisoners of war. Stop your friend suffering. Fuck, that is unbearable. Obviously he has orders to take us alive. And torture the truth out of us. But we live yet. Save him from his suffering. No. Put it in order to suffering of his friend. Or I will. Right, time to leave Reines. - Steiner. Take Reines to see Sweden. - What? I need grenades. And in 30 seconds. end up with this. When you throw the bloody grenades Me and Mac will move north. You move east. Meet in Stockholm. If we stay together We have more possibilities. Split up will bear more chances. Make sure you arrive safely. You are a bloody good command, sir. It was a privilege. God forgive me. No. - Reines, throw the bloody grenade. - Throw the grenade. Reines. Go, go. Move. Are you dead, sir? - Ammo? - Low. What do you want to do, Major? - You go, I'll cover you. - You fuckin go. Come on. Steiner. Look at me. Come with me. Come, get up, soldier. Fucking lazy, fucking Steiner. Don't stand there. It's ok. Do not die. Stay there. Wait, come back for you. Drop the knife. Reines, come on. Reines. Reines. Reines. Your orders were to carry me home or to shoot if you couldn't. If you stay here you're gonna die. I'm not going to shoot myself. If you are strong, bastard. let's go. That's Sweden. Bloody good.
