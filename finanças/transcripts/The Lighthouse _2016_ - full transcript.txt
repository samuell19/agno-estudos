That him? Aye. You've never kept the Smalls before, I hear. She's not an easy keep, boy. She don't want us here. Neither do these bastard rocks. A stint on that wooden bitch, well, ha! Well... You'll see. You'll see. Hello, old girl. Enough oil? Salt pork: 100 pounds. Salt beef: 50 pounds. Flour: two barrels. Rice: 50 pounds. Weather: partly cloudy. A moderate breeze. TG, principal lighthouse keeper. Henry Rees, John Elias, Daniel Rowlands, Christmas Evans, David Jones, Charles Johns. In company with Christ, who died and now lives. May they rejoice in your kingdom, where all our tears are wiped away. Amen. The weather is turning. Rain. Aye. Seventh day. Weather: rain first half of watch, afterwards, clearing. Calm. Structure and lens in good repair. TG, principal lighthouse keeper. Good. Mmm. Very good. I know you do not want me here, Tom, but we have a job to do. Hmm. Good, good. If they find you out here, we'll both be relieved of our duty. Only you and I are here, Tom. Do you plan to tell them? I cannot fish from up there. Aye. You're right, Thomas. We're here to keep the light. And that we must do together. Do you play? Play what, Howell? 12th day. Weather: winds increasing from northeast and east. TG, principal lighthouse keeper. Ha! You'll need to do better than that, boy! You will look after us whilst we're here, will you not, old girl? Yes. A month. A month is all. Good girl. We'll be gone before long. No fish? Do you ever wonder what is happening back there? Back on shore? Sometimes. What is happening right now... ...back home in Solva. People are living their lives. They work, eat, sleep and shit. Same as us here on this rock. Here on this rock, aye. Twenty-five miles from land. Do you ever ask yourself why we do this? My father was a keeper, same as his father. It's in my blood. And this... This is peace. True peace. Out here... There's nothing else like it. Peace? There's nothing here, Tom. Nothing. Waves and rocks is all. Yeah. There we have it. Peace. Another hour. We've work to do. I wish to apologize, Tom. I did not mean to offend you, to question your reasons for keeping, or the peace you find here. I understand what it is you find in all this. Do you? No. I do not think you do. Not peace, nor keeping. I am not new to this work... We have a responsibility, Howell. The greatest responsibility. Ships from all across this world, America, India, Africa, will pass, and we are the only light in the vast, deep darkness. We live and die to keep those at sea safe. Tom... What happened... South Bishop Island... The light. Henry Rees, John Elias, Daniel Rowlands, Christmas Evans, David Jones, Charles Johns. In company with Christ, who died and now lives. Amen. Hello? Hello? Hello?! Hello?! Henry Rees, John Elias... ...Daniel Rowlands, Christmas Evans, David Jones... No. No... When did it come in? Small hours. Two-hour shifts. Sound the warning every five minutes. She could be in for a few days. Howell! 22nd Day. It's time. Weather: heavy fog still. Squalls from northeast and east. Squalls increasing in force, last hour of watch. Storm's coming in. It will clear this damned fog at least. We have work to do. Oil. Weather: torrential rain. Howell! Oil! Heavy winds from northeast and north. Squalls increasing. - This is not good. - She will pass. 30th day. Storm endless. Heavy squalls increasing. Gales from northeast and east. No relief boat has yet landed. Rations low. It's getting worse. There will be no way to escape this rock. Our time could be up and nobody would even know. We are running low on fuel. The rations, the drinking water, depleted! We have another few days here. They'll send relief when this is done. It will pass! ...and Jesus answered and said unto him, "Seest thou these great buildings?" "There shall not be left one stone upon a stone, that shall not be thrown down." "Moreover in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall wax dark, and the moon shall not give her light... ...and the stars of heaven shall fall... ...and the powers which are in heaven shall fall." Thomas! No! We need to repair it. Too dangerous in this. At first light. They will not come in this. There will be no rescue vessel until this is done. They have to come for us. I've never seen its like. Never. They will not chance a boat. We don't have much longer. I know. This is the last of the meat? You carry that with you now? That will be of no help. Not here. Not on this rock. Think that will help you? Pleading? Pleading with Him up there? That He hears you? Cares? That He will answer you? Listen! Listen! That is the only God that answers out here. Tom? Tom! Tom... What? It's not the Sabbath, is it? What is this? Ah. Henry Whiteside. He built this wooden bitch. Began summer of 1775. Winter of '76, a storm came in. Whiteside and his boys were trapped out here in it. No rescue boats. She was a bad one. Like this. So, old Whiteside put a message in one of these. Begged for rescue. Pleaded for it. Like you, to Him. Well, that bottle made the crossing. Twenty-five miles of the Irish Sea. Twenty-five miles of hell. They came for them? Aye. This chest has been here since that lamp was first lit. Why? You know why. A mercy. This island does not want us here. Before this beacon was built, she took hundreds of lives. Perhaps she is still hungry. And if we were to die, if they do not come, the tower washes away, however it went... ...I would rather die drunk. That will do it. You've saved our souls. Told you, that book will do no good. Not here, not now. It is my only solace. Oooh... solace! You are drunk, Tom. There are six men beyond solace now. Leave it, Tom. Six good men, all dead, and you are here. Do you ever think of them? With every breath I draw. I did not want this haul. Not here. - Not with you! - Leave it. There is an ill luck about you, Thomas Howell! You've brought this down on us. Cursed us! - You! - You need to sleep, Tom! You've damned us both! What you did has damned us both! You should not be here! The sea, she remembers all. You, with your book... How often did you visit chapel before South Bishop? Get out of my sight. Tom! Tom! Good girl. Tom... No. No, no, no. No. Please. There is no hope. We're dead men. The storm will take us. It's over. It's over! Damn you! Damn you! Over! It's over! Over! Over! Over! Got me good.

Of that I am sure. You're right. Of that I am sure. To be on land. - Land. - Land. If you could be anywhere now... ...where would you be? Anywhere? Abermawr. Ah... Abermawr. Oh, you should see it. Summer meadows and the bluebell woods. Abermawr. It is where I proposed to my wife. If I could be there, on that day, forever. You never talk of your family. Yeah. Gone. All gone. Gone. Gone, gone... Tom. Tom. Bonny young thing. I'd have done anything for her. Anything. Heledd. Your wife? My wife... and my darling Annie. Daughter? Hmm. Consumption took them both. I'm sorry, Tom. I lost them ten year ago. No. No. Eleven. Ah.

You blame me, Tom. You... all of you. Henry Rees, John Elias, Daniel Rowlands, Christmas Evans, David Jones... ...Charles Johns. Henry Rees. John Elias. Daniel Rowlands. Christmas Evans. David Jones. Charles Johns. Six men dead because of me. - Do you know what happened? - It's not the time. Do you know what happened? You fell asleep. I fell asleep and six men died. I fell asleep and left 12 children without fathers and widowed four wives. So you are right. I am a curse. This storm, a punishment. I pray that they are... at His side. - That they are safe... - Pray? I pray for them every night. Six men dead and you pray? Do you think He cares? Listens? No. My Annie was four when that bastard saw fit to cut her down! Four! Tiny! And in the cold ground, my baby! My Annie! And do you think prayer brought her back to me? No! If He can put us into the world, this darkness, this pit of pain and cruelty, then we are nothing to Him! So you pray. Pray and grovel! See if He listens. See if that brings them back! - Tom! Tom! Tom! Tom! - What? The beacon! Tom, help me! Fuck the light! Fuck this place! Tom, we have to light her! Leave her dark! - Do you not see? - Tom, please! - We are dead men! Dead! - Tom, help me! - We have to light her! Please! - Dead! Tom, help me! Help, you say? - Why do you not beg Him? - No! If you grovel before Him, does He hear you? - Does He care? - Help me, Tom! - Do You hear us? - Tom! No! Tell me! - We have to light the light! - Where is your God now? No! Tom! Tom! Tom! Take my hand! Tom! Tom... Tom... No! No! You will lie with them, Tom. I promise you. I do not know what to do for you, Tom. It's seven men now. And you blame me... All of you. South Bishop... Do you know what happened? What really happened? It was my fourth keep. But... but my first island. An island, Tom. An island, like this. Miles from land... and a fog came in. A fog, heavy. Seven days. We thought it would never end. No relief on an island. They will not risk a boat. We rang that bastard bell, day and night and... ...and on the sixth day, Lewis fell sick. A fever, bad. So I... I stood on that platform and rang that bell for 15 hours. I cannot remember sleeping, Tom. But when I woke up, six men were dead. They hit the rocks in the fog, drowned, all of them, because I slept. And now this, another dead man... And they will blame me for you also. But you fell, Tom. You fell! To the Smalls. Still hungry. How's the food, Tom? How long, Tom? How long till they come for us? You do not wish to talk tonight? Fine. Fine! You'll have to do better than that, boy. You'll have to do better than that. Henry Rees, John Elias, Daniel Rowlands, Christmas Evans, David Jones, Charles Johns... Thomas Griffith. In company with Christ, who died and now lives. You stink, Tom. Outside, Tom. You're going outside. Bastard! You'll be fine here, Tom. I will not give your body up to the sea. She is deep and dark... and endless. That is no burial for a man. Henry Rees, John Elias... they never retrieved their bodies. I cannot do the same to you. You will rest with your wife and daughter, that I promise you. Tom? You're dead, you're dead! Storm endless. Thomas Griffith is dead. A terrible accident. I fear to be left alone without aid on the Smalls. Supplies low. TH, light keeper. In company with Christ who died and now lives. May he rejoice in your kingdom... No... Seven men... David Jones, Charles Johns, Thomas Griffith, Henry Rees, John Elias, Daniel Rowlands, Christmas Evans, David Jones, Charles Johns, Thomas Griffith. I plan to stay true to my post and maintain the light as best I can. I begin to fear for my sanity, alone on this wretched island. No relief boat has been dispatched into this damned storm. Have they left me here to perish? God save me. Tom? Help! Please! Help! Help! Help! Help! I now know this island is wicked beyond the darkest of dreams. These rocks are cursed. What is this limbo? Has he damned my soul? His dead right arm now hangs inches from my window. It is beckoning me outside to face this endless storm... ...and the evil spirits that dance across the poisoned waters. No ship will land here. Am I in hell? Quiet! Poor move, Tom. Poor move. You blame me, Tom. You fell. You fell. Poor move. You blame me, but you fell. But you fell. You blame me, but you fell. Concentrate, Tom. Concentrate. Six men, not seven. You blame me, Tom. You blame me, and I cannot be held accountable for that. You blame me, but you fell. Tom, quiet now. Quiet! Why can you not leave me alone, you bastard? You are dead, Tom. Thomas hangs outside my window. No Christian burial for a man. No rest. His soul, I am certain, is halfway between this life and the next one. And I fear that it haunts me within this black tower. There is no longer any distraction from the darker corners of my imagination. A purgatory that grows as this damned storm rages on. I fear the Devil lurks within the shadows of this tower with me. - This island... - Thomas... Is this hell? Thomas Howell. Is this his punishment? May God save my soul. Thomas. Thomas Howell. Thomas. Thomas Howell... Seven men. Come now, Thomas Howell. It is time. - You know what you must do. - No... Seven men, Thomas Howell. - No... - Seven men. Leave me! Join us. - No! - Seven men, Thomas Howell. - Seven men. - Leave me! Leave! Seven men, Thomas Howell. Seven men. Join us. I know that the Lord has damned me for what I did. My very soul is now in peril. I can no longer endure this punishment. And unto every Christian soul that is distressed grant thou mercy. Forgive me. Eight men. Bastard. You are dead, Tom. Leave me alone. Join us. When he comes for me... I suffer the darkness of the other world. Come now, Thomas Howell. Join us. Through the black hours of every night, this Devil's knock interrupts my terrible dreams. Accept his punishment. I know now that Thomas Griffith haunts this tower. He wishes me to damn myself to hell. He wishes to punish me. He walks this cursed place in the darkness of death, and he wishes me to damn my eternal soul with the noose. Leave me! He will not take me. He will not take me! He will not take me! He will not take me! No! Tom? When can I go home, Thomas? You cannot go home. Why? Because you fell. So I cannot go home? No. I'm lonely out here. Will you stay with me? I cannot stay. - Why? - I... You are... I cannot find them. Not here. Not in this place. Who? Heledd... ...and my Annie. I cannot find them here. I cannot find them here. Am I... in hell? The others are here, Thomas. The others? Henry Rees, John Elias, Daniel Rowlands, Christmas Evans... ...David Jones, Charles Johns. No. And now you. I'm not dead, Tom. No... No, no, no. No, no, no! No! I know what I must do. I must rid myself of Thomas Griffith. I must cast him into the deep. This island took you, Thomas. Your soul, it is already lost. You will not take me. You will not take me. The Devil is here! Do you not remember, Thomas? Ending it? When he comes for me... Ending it all with the noose? I did not damn myself. I did not hang! - I did not damn myself! - You are in hell. - I did not damn myself! - Eight men, Thomas. - The Devil... - Eight men. Come now, Thomas Howell. It is time. - Eight men. - Seven! - Eight men. - Seven. - Eight men. - Seven men. You are in hell. It is time. - Seven men. - Thomas Howell. Seven. I will not damn myself to hell! - Seven men. - Come! Charon waits! No! You will not take me. You will not take me. The Devil is here. I will endure your punishment. - Seven. - And I will be redeemed! Henry Rees! John Elias! Daniel Rowlands! Christmas Evans! David Jones! Charles Johns! Thomas Griffith! I will endure your punishment... and I will be redeemed! I've seen it, Tom. What, Thomas? What did you see? You're in hell. We're both in hell, Thomas. The storm took us both. It took you, Tom. Took you. Both our souls burn, Thomas. No. We both died on this island, Thomas. Both you... and I. Come now... ...Thomas Howell. It's time to leave. Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'entrate. Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'entrate... I have paid. You will not take me. I am not dead. I have paid. I did not hang. I did not hang! I did not damn myself! No! Thomas Howell. No! You will not take me. You will not take me! It is time, Thomas Howell. I am redeemed! - Thomas! - I am redeemed! Thomas! You will not take me! I have paid... You're safe! You're safe now. You're going home. - Thomas Griffith... - You're safe now.
