[Jazzy music] [people chatting and laughing] Thanks. Thank you. Oh, look. He's proposing to her. - Yes. - Yes? Yes. What happened? He proposed. In public? That's risky. You proposed to me in public. Well, a public place, we were the only ones there. I couldn't figure out why you were making me climb up that hill. You kept telling me to hurry. I wanted to get there before sunset. I thought I had to do something special to beat that other guy, what's his name? You lived with him, had all the money. Oh, Adam. I thought he must have done something really spectacular when he proposed. You didn't have to worry. He never proposed. And he didn't have that much money. What do you mean he never proposed? Oh, you know, things just ran their course. I'm sure you told me he proposed. No, I couldn't have. I mean he wanted to marry me, yeah. If he wanted to marry you, surely he would have proposed. No, you know, what it's like. Women have to hint a bit. I never did any of that, so he never asked. Even though he wanted to marry me. Well, you couldn't have been certain if he never asked. Oh, I knew. God, we were so young. Didn't know what love was. I'm sure you told me he proposed. No. Ooh, chocolate cake sounds tempting, but I shouldn't. So who did propose to you? Nobody, just you. On the hill, in the dark. I got a ring and a blister. Do you wanna split the cake? Wait. So no one else ever proposed to you? God, I'm sure you somebody else had proposed to you. Well, it's a good thing they didn't, because if someone had, I might have said "yes" and then I wouldn't have been available to marry you. Oh, come on, how many proposals did you get? Well, men don't get proposals. I'm just illustrating the absurdity of judging someone on the basis of-- Two. Even though men don't usually get proposals. The first one was Cynthia. You said Cynthia was an idiot. And then the second one was Charlotte. Hang on, I haven't memorized your dating history. Which one's Charlotte? I'm not sure I ever told you about Charlotte. Because you just made her up? I met her when I was backpacking around Europe. Oh, she wanted to emigrate to Canada. Well, it wasn't 1946. And I'd also like to point out that you emigrated to Canada to marry me. And I would like to point out that moving from London to Toronto is not a step up. Charlotte lived in Paris. A very good arrondissement. Uh, 16th, I believe. I doubt it was the 16th. Oh, I believe it was the 16th. And she said she couldn't live without me, we should get married and spend our lives together. Oh. Did she say that in English or French, because your French is not very good. Her English was excellent and she also knew some Italian. Oh, everybody knows some Italian. Ciao. Buona sera. Cappuccino. Oh, we're done. We are so done. Actually, I would like a coffee. Just a regular coffee, black, no sugar. Look, it's fine. What's fine? You know, that I was the only one who proposed to you. Fine? Oh, you know what I mean. I could have had other proposals, plenty of proposals, if I'd wanted. I-- I just didn't lead men on. Oh, come on. Plenty? Plenty. Men liked me. Well, of course men liked you. You're a very attractive woman. But-- Liking someone and proposing to them is something totally different. So you're saying the problem isn't my looks, it's-- it's my personality? Let's change the subject, I don't care-- No, no, you are not getting off the hook by changing the subject. And you do seem to care an awful lot, so I'm telling you that I could have got other men to propose to me, if that's the standard you judge people by. A very old-fashioned, quite offensive standard. I just generally thought some other guy had proposed to you-- the rich guy, whoever, but if it didn't happen, it's okay. Well, just so you know, if it makes you feel better, if it helps you sleep at night, I could still get a man to propose to me. I mean not some 22-year-old, but a man could fall in love with me. A man my own age. Yeah, I could make that happen, if I wanted it to. You cannot guarantee that you could get a man to propose. To sleep with you? Yes. But it's a big thing for a man to propose. Oh yes, I could get a man to propose to me! If I went after the next man who walked through that door and I-- I tried-- I turned on the charm, I fluffed up his ego, I could get him to fall for me like-- Like that. That. If I really wanted to. Oh my God. What are you doing? You're not-- I just wanna see who the lucky guy is. Oh, you're not-- You know, I didn't mean it literally. Oh, I'm-- no, I'm not playing this game. Yeah, uh, and you do know the odds are quite overwhelming that whoever comes through that door will be female or married or the wrong age or gay. So you are officially backing down from the bet, right? So we can say that I won? Wouldn't want him to think I was already taken. As Charlotte would say, "Arrivederci, baby." Isabel. Hi. A bit of a draught over there. Yeah. And what can I get you? Could I have a glass of red wine? Thanks. [Laughing out loud] Just uh, happy. What a fun evening. Do you eat here often? I'm not-- I'm not eating. You're English. Small world. Wow! Wow, we-- We have so much in common. Don't you find North Americans kind of arrogant sometimes? Did you-- you eat already or you're not hungry, just wondering? I've already eaten. I don't-- I really don't feel like talking. Oh! Sure. I'll uh-- I'll have another, please. Oh, me, too. Just, yeah, one more at least. Probably more. [Mouthing words inaudibly] You know, I have a little twitch sometimes. How is your drink? I'm thinking maybe I should have ordered something stronger. It's a drink. It's uh, vodka with some ice cubes. That wasn't funny. No. No, it wasn't. I don't know if anyone falls for an absolute stranger. Do they? I-- someone walks through the door and poof! Your life's changed, a grand passion, and you know. Instead of a-- a reasonably nice guy leading you up a hill and where do you end up? Sitting at a bar on your own on a Saturday night feeling like shit. The ironic thing is I would be thrilled to fall for an absolute stranger at the moment. I really would. I might not have said that yesterday, but today it would be wonderful. Life doesn't really happen like that though, does it? It doesn't work out that way. Well, there was this one time, I wa-- I was on a school trip in Dublin. I was-- what? 15. And my friend and I had wandered off. We weren't supposed to. But we met this boy, he was maybe 18, which seemed so grown-up, and we started talking. We talked about everything; music, politics, books, we really connected. And then this boy and I, we started dancing, just going down the street at night, dancing. My friend just stood back and watched. And other people were looking, but we didn't care. Oh! I still remember what his hand felt like on my back. Anyway, we said goodbye, it was getting really late and uh, we were gonna be in so much trouble. And as he walked away from me, he looked back and said, "See ya." We both knew we never would. Never again. And if we met now, we wouldn't even recognize each other. We wouldn't know that we'd spent that magical night dancing down the street. But that's what I want, to feel like that again. That's what I want a man who walks through that door to do to me. Ooh, thank you. I'm not-- I'm not paying for that. No, I'm-- I'm not paying for her drinks. - Just-- - No, no, of course not. You know, I wasn't born yesterday. - And neither were you, quite frankly. - What? Well, uh-- S-- see this woman just sits next to me, I don't know. And-- first of all she was sitting over there, and then she sits next to me, starts laughing and smiling, and doing these weird things with her face and then ordering drink after drink-- Two drinks. And then talkin' about ooh, how she can just fall in love with some man when she sees him walk through the door, like she's fallen in love with me. Well, I meant-- I meant that-- And so I don't know if you're in on it. I know-- I know some establishments do that, they scam-- This is a family restaurant. We have a children's menu. I can pay for my own drinks. Okay, I-- I don't have my purse. Oh! Oh, she doesn't have her purse, what a surprise. I'd-- you know. I have-- I've had enough of this. So thank you. Sorry. Oh, just-- You know, you should be ashamed of yourself! [Cal] Everyone saw it. Everyone. [Laughing] Oh my God, I can't stop laughing. Apparently, I am only man who has ever proposed to her. Who knew? I'll talk to you later. Bye, Mom. Oh, be sure to tell Dad. What time is it in Spain? You are not calling our son. Yeah, he is probably asleep. [Chuckles] My sister. [Cal] Kara? - Maggie? - Yes. - Kevin? - Definitely. Maybe just a touch more spice. [Sniffing] Don't you think it smells like despair? And rejection. It's strawberry and cinnamon tea. Maybe it's me that smells like that. Oh, can't tell. Can we change its smell? Oh of course, we can change the smell. To something that doesn't cause cancer and kill people. Maybe not. If only we could add a dash of optimism and a cry for help, then we'd really have a product that sells. Isabel, your 10:00 is here. Who-- who's my 10:00? Uh, an office supply salesman. He said that he can beat the prices that Cardona is giving us. Yes. Send him in. So the strawberry cinnamon tea? If we can't add hope and happiness? Ask them to try a touch more cinnamon. I, uh-- I-- I just remembered something I have to do. Well, I uh-- I have lots to do. I am the president of this company. That's my name, right there. - Oh! - Me. Yeah, it's a small company, we make tasty teas, but uh, keeps me busy. And this is one of those times, when I am busy. Maggie, can you handle Mr.-- - Mace-- Um. - Whatever. So, oh my God. She's... ...the president of the company. Women are allowed to do that now. No, I d-- I didn't mean that. I-- I'm-- um, d-- Sorry. Um, stop, sir! Please, stop! Wait. He'd like to see you. Mr. Office Supplies Salesman. Well, I don't want to speak to him. Okay, that makes sense, because his products are really crappy like his pen. Leaked all over me. Please tell him to go fuck himself. Hi. I just wanted one minute, please. Thank you, Maggie. Okay. I just wanted to apologize for what happened on Saturday night. Let's just end this right here. I-- I-- I mean-- I-- you know, I thought you were a hooker. You made your thoughts very clear. I just wish there was something I could do to make up for um-- Uh, I was having a horrible day. And so was I. Again, I'm afraid I don't have time for you, I have another meeting, and decisions to make. I'm a productive, fairly successful person. How can I word this? A woman who can pay for her own drinks. Could I buy you dinner? Why on Earth would I ever agree to-- Please. Are you free tonight? Hey. - We should watch that movie tonight. - Sorry, I have a thing tonight. Didn't I tell you? A-- a thing. I thought you wanted to see that movie. The one with women. And have a quiet evening in? I was gonna cook. - You were gonna cook? - Spaghetti. Your favorite. Oh! Well... Maybe I-- I could skip the thing. Great. - You look nice. - Thank you. - How was your day? - Yeah. - We're testing a new tea. - Hmm. I had a great day. I told Hank about you and that guy at the restaurant. Oh my God, he couldn't stop laughing. So then he starts asking everybody else if they'd been proposed to. He had one. And you know who had the most? Ellen. Five. And she's not even that pretty. You know what, I think I should go to my thing. Yeah. Really shouldn't miss it. Are you sure? Don't wait up. I told you there was construction. - Stop. - No, but I told you. Why did we have to do the same route? Fuck you. Just fuck, fuck. Fuck you! Hi. Hi. You okay? Just one of those days. Weeks. We were all gonna get together one of these days. Oh yeah, we-- we should do that. You look like you got a special night ahead of you. Yeah, maybe I do. Yeah, we'll see. You look amazing. Thanks. Oh, I won't be staying. I don't think she's coming. Oh. Um, uh-- - [thud] - Oh! - I'm sorry, I'm late. - No, no. N-- n-- no, no, not at all. No, you-- You are a woman worth waiting for. Um, uh. Um, thank you. I didn't think you'd come. I-- I keep saying, "Albert, pinch yourself. You must be dreaming." - Dreaming? - Well-- I mean, I think that's what was wrong on Saturday night. I-- I-- I thought that a wo-- woman like that couldn't possibly be interested in me. - I-- - Oh! Okay, I thought-- I mean you're so... - Really, I thought-- - And-- and-- and-- Um, and president of a company. Oh, it's a small company. We're really just scraping by, it's a lot of work. That's so impressive. You know, I-- God, I hate my job sometimes. Oh, I'm sorry. That's such a shame. It used to be okay, but um, then this guy bought the company and he is not a nice man. He lowered the standard of the merchandise, so nobody wants to buy it anymore. And he-- he treats us-- Well, I-- I wanted to take the day off today for um... Yeah, just a family matter, and um-- He just said, "No way". He screamed at me. That's terrible. So what did you do? Nothing. You should stand up to him. Tell him he can't talk to you like that. - Do you think so? - Absolutely. Life's too short. Do you find life short? I-- I find it kind of long sometimes. Then you're not living it the right way. Up until now. Yeah, you know, I-- I will have the chocolate cake. And then what made you go into sales? Well, I liked product management-- Well, you know, as much as anyone likes their job, but um, then the new owner, that Ed that I told you about, he gave my job to his son and moved me to sales. And I-- a-- any-- anyway, you know, you don't want to hear any more about me. Uh, um. Um-- um, uh, you've told me almost nothing about your life. Well, your family, where you live or-- I already know everything about me. What about your family? I just-- Oh, it's just been me and my mother. Aw, that's sweet, a man who is close to his mom. You have a wedding ring. Oh. Oh! You didn't the other night, I don't think. No. But yes. Yes, I-- I do. I-- I have a wedding ring on at this moment. Because um... Oh, this is embarrassing, but um, sometimes men I-- in my job-- I mean not my employees or I would fire them. But sometimes uh-- Women don't like to be bothered. I mean, younger women get this so much more than I do, but you'd be surprised, anyone would be surprised, I mean it sounds almost unbelievable, doesn't it, that I-- I would have to wear a fake wedding ring to discourage unwanted advances. Of course! And why didn't I think of that? - A woman as lovely as you are-- - Oh. - As successful--- - Oh-- - As charming-- - Really, it's just a-- Men must chase you all the time. I-- Oh. Oh, excuse me. Oh. Uh, oh, I'm sorry, I-- I've got to leave. - Um-- - Oh! - Let me pay for my dinner. - No, no. - Uh, um-- - Sorry, I have got to rush. - You had a friend-- - What? Text you. No, I-- I wouldn't do that-- I know that's what women do, I've read about it. Th-- this is a real emergency. Well, then go. Oh, wait. Wait, wait! Can I see you again? [Cal] Isabel! What happened? I was loading the dishwasher when my back went "pop". You texted, "Come home now, urgent." In capitals. I thought something had happened to Colin. Well, actually he emailed earlier. He's having a great time in Barcelona. I don't think he's missing us at all. Well, I kept calling, you didn't answer- I left the phone in the kitchen. Yeah. I could hear it, but I really couldn't get to it. - Is there any chance for a massage? - I can't believe this. [Cal] Oh, come on! You don't like those business things anyway, I thought I was doing you a favor. Oh God! [Isabel] And don't forget to tell shipping about the new order going to Kingston, I don't want it to be late. If we can get them as regular customers, that would be great, and we need-- Surprise. Uh-ha! Uh... Uh, guy-- guys, would you give Albert and I a quick minute? Oh, Albert? Um, would you like to take this meeting with the door open or... No, close it please. So I was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd pop by-- No, I wasn't-- I wasn't-- I wasn't in the neighborhood. I made a-- a special trip. Well, thank you. These are uh, really pretty-- I've had the most amazing morning ever, but uh, before I tell you about that, how was the emergency? - Everything alright? - Uh, not that big a deal after all. Uh, you know, I-- I'm afraid I'm in the middle of something. What you said about a stranger walking into the door, I've felt that so often. I-- you know, is there someone out there for me, and if there is, if she walks in the room, will I know it? Will I-- am I gonna do anything? And you-- You were so brave. You sat right next to me and... Uh, well, I really wanted a glass of wine. So uh, you know what? I really need to return some calls. Those things you said about that young boy you know-- You know, in Dublin. You were listening? I was just rambling. I've never heard anything like that. Not the, you know, dancing down the street part. I-- I don't even know if I've-- If I've ever really been in love. I mean not-- not like what I could feel for the right person. Well, is anyone really the right person? Pfft. Who knows? Life is m-- messy. My mother died. What? That's why I was drinking alone on a Saturday night. I'm not usually a drinker. You know, my mother just-- What do they call it now? Passed. Passed what? Passed an exam. Passed an exam. It's sounds like if you get a B plus, you're going to get to die. I had no idea. Oh my God, I-- - I should have left you alone. - No, no, no, that-- That was wonderful. It was-- it was wonderful. It was her funeral, um, yesterday afternoon. But you were here yesterday, your sales call in the morning. That's what I was telling you about at dinner. So my boss wouldn't give me the whole day off for my mother's funeral. Well, it's just a half day. I mean, he-- he just likes to be mean. Anyway, that is done. That's what I was here to tell you about, what you said-- What did I say? About to stand up to him. So this morning I marched into the office and I really told him off. In front of everyone. Oh, well-- Good for you. Oh, I should uh, really get back to-- Of course you would you know, it's your own company. But we are having dinner again tonight. I don't think I can. Well, then--- then uh, tomorrow night it is. I'm uh, quite busy these days. Sorry. I could be busy for quite a while. Alright, yeah. Oh yeah, well, then it's goodbye. Uh, of course. I uh, um, you know, I won't-- I won't bother you anymore. Just if-- if you do-- if you have time ever-- I, um... Here's my-- here, this is my personal card. - Uh, that's my personal cell, so um uh-- - Thanks. Um, well, so bye. - Bye. - Oh dear. Thanks, thank you so much. I'll close it. There's a salesman here from that office supply company with the leaky pens. - Oh, he came back! - No. No, it's a different guy. And I told him that we'd already said no, but he's being really insistent. - I could just tell him to get lost. - No, no, it's okay. Okay. Uh, sir? There you go. - Oh, hey. - Great. Hey, how you doin' today? Uh, I'm Ralph Pinson. And you are the head honcho, I'm told. - Mm-hmm, Isabel Llewellyn. - You like markers? 'Cause guess what? Boom. We got 'em. We had a salesman from your company here a week or so ago? Um, he's no longer with the company. - Oh? - Yeah, um, just between you and me. Uh, he had a freak-out in the office. Yeah, comes in one morning last week and starts screaming at the owner, wanted a day off for some little personal thing. It's always the quiet ones, right? Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me get this right. You tried to get an absolute stranger to propose to you? Did you have a timeframe for this? I mean-- I mean you're a good-looking woman, but-- but did you actually expect to accomplish this just in one evening? I asked you-- I begged you not to tell this story again. Oh no, it's a good story! Yeah, how could I resist, right? 'Cause even Marilyn Monroe would have thought, I might need two evenings. I lost my temper, my brain wasn't working, but obviously I wasn't gonna make some stranger fall for me and then dump him. That would be-- That would be cruel. Oh, she says that now. But at the time she thought she could get this guy to propose to her. No, I never set out to do that. I just thought-- If I thought anything, I'll chat this guy up, maybe get him to ask for my number and prove that I'm-- He was clearly upset about something. I-- I should have left him alone. Most people have only had one proposal, right? If that. Actually, I've been conducting an informal survey and on average so far women have 3.2, and I admit men only get 0.4. - What? - What? Now, I've only had one. Oh no, there was that guy. Does it count if he's drunk? No. - Sorry. - Life isn't a game. People have feelings, they get hurt. Excuse me. Isabel, come on. I knew I shouldn't have told you. It's a joke! I shouldn't have mentioned the drunk guy. Albert? Do you want us to leave? No, no, no. It's no big deal. She'll be back in a minute. Okay, I am stunned that that woman only had one proposal. I mean if I had met her when I was single. Really? You have to mention that while I'm sitting right across from you? Stop it. Maybe I should go check on her. I'm going out. Isabel, if the roles had been reversed you would have told everyone. It's not-- it's-- it's not what you think. Isabel, we have guests. I've got to go. Bye. I'm just gonna put this on the table, no one's ever proposed to me. [Door closes] Huh, some of us wouldn't be surprised by that. Isabel. Hi, uh-- [Albert vomiting] Okay, drink this, it's our ginger tea, it'll help your stomach. Well, I don't know if it really works, but-- I should never have told you where I live. Put down the bottle. Drink this instead. And now you'll find out that I lived with my mother, but I-- I had to have her here, she was sick. - Well, I don't care. - I-- I need a mint. Do you have any? Mm. I-- I gotta-- I've just gotta clean my teeth. - Maybe I have one-- - I've got-- No, I've just got teabags in here. You should try this, in case it helps. [Mumbling] Oh, uh-- uh, I'm sorry, I can't tell what you're saying. In case you wanna kiss me. I won't. No. Uh, Albert, it's not that kind of visit. It's really not. Please, drink this. I'm-- I'm gonna have a little bit of this instead. Put the bottle down. I think you coming here means you love me. No. No, no, no, it doesn't. I-- I just wanted to make sure you were okay. You-- you sounded in-- in really bad shape. You say you loved me. I never-- no! You said you fell in love with me when you saw me walk through the door in the restaurant. No, no, no, I-- I meant-- I-- I-- I-- did not use that word. I-- it-- it was a lot more complicated. Love is simple. It's not complicated. It's not. Oh, it is. It really is. When you loved me, that-- just that little bit of time, this tiny bit off-- that tiny bit of time, when you loved me-- when-- I knew you weren't a hooker and uh, I felt invincible! And then I did what you told me, I said to my boss. You got-- you got not right to treat me like that! And it just felt so good until he fired me. - No. - I'm really sorry for everything. No! I'm free! I'm free! It's wonderful. Oh no, it's wonderful. I don't know what I'm gonna all day. I just-- I'm so-- I'm gonna run out-- Soon I'm gonna run out of mommy. Money. Money. I didn't-- I never called her "mommy." I call-- I called her "mother" and then-- And now, she's gone. And that's-- And I miss her, actually. And um, I don't know why, 'cause she drove me crazy. But when she-- she-- I had to bring her over from England, 'cause she was getting confused, and then she got cancer, and what else could I do? What else could I do? I couldn't-- you know, but she really-- She really got on my nerves. I-- I used to say, "When will I get my life back?" That's horrible, isn't it? She's my mother. Why wasn't I nicer to my mother? We all feel like that when our mothers die. She knew you loved her. Mums do. I just didn't want her to die on her own, I didn't want her to die in somewhere stinkin' of piss. And I got a nurse for her, and you know, when I went to work, and you know, I didn't have-- I didn't earn that much money. I mean we were not those kind of people. You know, she worked-- Is that why you stopped loving me? 'Cause I'm not the president of a tea bag company? No, of course not. I don't care about things like that and I actually earn a lot less than you think. So am I still gonna get one chance? - Yes. - No. Yes. - No. - No. Yes. Albert, that is not going to happen. Ever. Oh, fuck it! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Come on, give me the bottle. You've had enough to drink. No! I can still feel. I want the pain to go away. I wanna feel absolutely nothing, but things still hurt. They-- look, watch. Oh! Oh! Fuck! I'm gonna be another couple of hours maybe. Uh... Isabel. - Uh, it's a long story. - Isabel! Uh, I'll explain when I get home. I-- I just called, because I didn't want you to worry. No, no, I'm fine. Uh, I'm not still mad. Well, I am, but I mean not because-- Oh, look, I-- I've gotta go. - Bye. - [Doctor] Mr. Mace? Who wants to know? Where's Isabel? - Hi. - Oh. - Are you his wife? - Maybe soon. Uh, I'm a friend. Okay, well, we have the X-ray results and the CT scan. How did you receive your injury? I hit myself over the head with a bottle of vodka. O-- okay. Well, uh, under normal circumstances I would recommend a psych evaluation, but your alcohol level is pretty high. - So-- - His mother died recently. Anyway, it looks like you have a concussion. Why do you keep checking my head? It's my heart that hurts. You have chest pain? Okay, I did not know that. We're gonna have to get a few more tests. - I think he means that-- - She did it. So you're-- you're-- you're the one that hit him? In the-- in the chest or the head? Uh, I think he means it's broken. - His heart. - She loved me and then suddenly "poof". She stopped. But I'm gonna win her back, you know, if it's the last thing I do. Okay, just-- just calm down, okay, Mr. Mace. She's not really married. She just wears a wedding ring, so men will leave her alone. - Okay, can we have a word? In-- in private? - Yes. Yeah, of course. Hey, hey! Don't try to steal my girlfriend. I-- I promise I'll bring her right back. Oh, I should never have told you she was single. Damn it. - I should explain, maybe-- - You-- no, it's-- it's -- it's your business. - [Phone ringing] - Uh, but you do seem very popular. You know, he's gonna feel a lot better as the painkillers kick in. Oh, good. But basically, I'm undecided on whether to order some cardiac tests for him-- Oh, I'm pretty certain he means the other kind of heart trouble. - That-- that heart. - Okay. Uh, I-- I think he's just a drunk sad man with a mild concussion and a complicated love life. He doesn't belong here, exposed to infections, plus the state that he's in, he's gonna be disruptive to other patients, and we'd probably have to put him in restraints which would be pretty horrible. So I think what's best for him is just to go home and sleep it off. Okay. With someone watching over him, waking him up every two hours the entire night. I'll uh, I'll see that it's done. You sure? Because he cannot be alone. If he's fine in the morning, then sure, he can be alone again. No, I can do it. I promise. - [Phone ringing] - Hey! I told you not to steal my girlfriend. Uh. Why is it put on my fingers and-- Watch it. - Just not bad. - Uh, Albert. - Uh, Albert, this way. - I did it-- of course-- - Here. This way. - What? This? Oh, let's dance. - Let's-- Let's dance right now. - No, no, no. - You're supposed to rest. - No, I don't wanna rest-- - I wanna dance. - I have to get you home. - No, I don't wanna go home. I just-- - Well, you-- you have to! My-- my mother died there. You know, I can't take it there, you know? Let's go to like a four-star hotel and have like a champagne. - Oh shit, I know my credit card's ma-- - Albert. - Maxed out. - I-- I have to get you home. I-- what? Why don't we-- why don't we go to your place? - That's not possible. - It's possible. Or well-- whoa! Look, well, it's your place or I sit here all night! Albert, I can't take you there! Why not? [Phone ringing] Who is it who keeps calling you all the time? Someone calling, calling. Who is it? Is it some-- is it someone I should-- Okay, okay, okay! Let's go to my place. Yes, let's! Wait a minute, I'm-- I'm comin'. Okay. I'm much better, actually. I'm fine now. I'm absolutely fine. - Okay, here we are. - Oh, this is nice. This-- these are-- I-- I've only ever lived in apartments. Listen, maybe after we marry, we should live in your place and not mine. Have you-- do you ever-- Do you ever like dance on the lawn? - No. - Maybe-- oh, come on. I want to dance with you like the boy who made you happy. Just-- yeah. Come on, hey! Albert! - Please stop. - Okay. Oh, oh, uh. [Humming a song] Okay, I'm coming. Oh my God! Oh, you're home. Hi. - You're okay? - You're still here! - Of course. - Yeah, we were all so worried! Yeah, I almost called the police. You know, it sounded like you were at the hospital, I was pretty worried. - Oh, I'm fine. Just fine. - So what happened? - Uh, so uh-- - [Albert] Isabel! - Oh yeah. - Who is that? Oh! Oh! Oh, you have roommates. Nice to meet you. No, ow! Ouch, I'm sorry. Hello. Hello. Hello. - Hello. - Yeah. Albert. Hello, Albert. I think that-- I think I might need to vomit again. - Right through there. - Okay. I'll be right back, darling. I can explain, sort of. Who is that? That's the guy from the restaurant, Saturday night. - The bet! - Oh my God! Okay, that's the first thing. No one mentions the bet. Do you understand? Under no circumstances whatsoever. You promise me or I will walk right out that door again. Okay, I promise. - Okay. - Okay, whatever you need. Okay, I met him again by accident. It's the truth! And then we-- we had dinner. - You went on a date with another man. - Oh my God. That's not the important part of the story. I think that is the important part of the story. I don't have long, he'll be back in a minute. His mother died, he lost his job because of me, he got a concussion, and then he hurt his hand trying to punch a doctor. - I'm supposed to care about this loser? - We are the bad people here. We? I have never spoken to that man. - You goaded me on. - I did not. - I kind of think you did. - Honey, we weren't there. Well, all Cal has been talking about is Isabel only had one proposal and he's had two. I'm just saying, I'm begging you, be kind to him. - What's he doing in my home? - Our home. And he can't be alone tonight, because of the concussion! So call his family or call his friends. I don't know if there is anyone and he's so drunk uh, and confused. This is a stranger my wife went on a date with. - I don't care about him. - I promised the doctor I would stay with him tonight. What would you rather I went to his apartment? I don't think so. - Yeah, she's got a point there. - Max. Why don't you think about what I want? And I want him out of my house! Come on, this is insane! False alarm. What are we doing, huh? We're gonna have a game of charades? It really is-- have you got any vodka? No. And uh, you need to lie down. - So uh, come through here. - Oh! - Oh, this is nice. - Yeah. - I like this. - Yeah, okay, so just lie down. Lie down? And I'm gonna set an alarm-- - Lie down over here? - For two hours. Two hours? Thanks, darling. Now I've got all ticklish feet. Oh, and she takes his shoes off. I put my back out, I got nothing. Nothing! Okay, so just close your eyes. - [Isabel] Yeah. - Oh, no, no. Stay with me. You need to sleep. You know, I can't-- Look, I will go to sleep if you give me a little goodnight kiss. You cannot talk to my wife like that. Oh fuck. Your wife? Isabel? She is my wife. We are married. No, she's not. She says she wears a wedding ring, so all the men she meets won't try to sleep with her. Oh, you told him that and he believed you? I didn't set a minimum IQ or say he had to be George Clooney, but-- Don't. Don't go there. You know, George Clooney-- She didn't sleep with George Clooney. I am not George Clooney. Lie down. Everything is gonna be fine. Of course, 'cause you can divorce him. - [Albert] Happens all the time. - Shh! Shh. You'll feel so much better in the morning. [Cal] No. This man is not staying in this house. Wake him up, get him out. I don't care where you take him. I think it's like the Pottery Barn rule. You break it, you buy it. At least, until he gets glued back together again. - You're picking him over me? - No! It's an extraordinary situation. Can I stay at your place? - Uh-- - Yes. Oh fuck. Oh! Oh! You're still awake. I was just bringing you down an extra blanket. This room gets so chilly at night. Thanks. - But you should be asleep. - Oh, I can't sleep. Honestly, I just find it so hard to believe. Isabel and that strange guy... I'm not the crazy one, right? Those bandages, and the drinking, and the shorts. I mean I have to admit when I first heard about all the, you know, how many proposals thing, I thought, "Hmm." It was just a joke. I didn't mean to you know-- Yeah, but then when she-- Was seeing him behind my back just to win a bet. Damn. What would you do? Well... Maybe this is your big chance. Big chance? Yeah. Like, nobody wants to be the bad guy, right? Right. Well, Isabel is dating another man, so clearly she is the guilty party here. You can have your freedom back. I thought we were happy together. Would any of this be happening if you were happy? [Phone ringing] You okay? This must be what people mean when they say, "You're living the dream." I have so much joy inside, I feel like I'm goin' to burst. I'm actually here with you. I kept dreaming that I was waking up and you were standing over me like an angel. How is your head today? It-- it-- it does hurt, but I think a bit less. I can't-- I can't remember anything about last night. How did I hurt my hand? You-- you don't remember the rest of the evening? It goes a bit of fuzzy. After breakfast, we should talk. Yeah. Let me get some coffee in me first. Oh, ever since Mr. Fluffy died, things just have been so boring around here. Having someone around is great. I'm just gonna go upstairs and get dressed. Don't you go away, okay? I did the right thing, didn't I? Line in the sand, right? Your wife comes home with another man home, you-- You know, you can't stay there. - Absolutely. - Yeah. But you did humiliate her. She was gonna retaliate. Oh no, the bet was just a joke, man. Yeah, a humiliating joke. It didn't give her the right to date. Yeah, it does, I think technically speaking. I think I'm in the right here. What do you think they're doing now? Well, we've had our Sunday breakfast, you're helping me with my bandage. We're just like a married couple. Okay. Uh, there's something I need to tell you, again. Maybe not now? - I r-- I-- I really need to leave. - You're leaving? - Yeah. - Oh, well. Okay. He's leavin'. [Cal] He's alone. What does that mean? - [Max] It's great. - [Cal] What? Yeah, yeah. She'll be comin' over any minute, sort things out. Right. And apologize to me, right? Wouldn't hope for too much. She's not coming yet. She's still not coming. Dude, it's been like 8 seconds. - Maybe I should go over there. - Fuck no. If she doesn't want you, and you go crawling over there, you're gonna feel so much worse than you do now. That is true. And I don't know if I can handle feeling any worse than I feel right now. So maybe-- okay, I'll take my time. Give her some time to think about what she's done to me. It's been two hours. Marriage is a contract. She broke the rules, he has no further obligation-- Yeah, maybe to you it's a contract. I'm going over there. That is a huge mistake. Oh. You don't understand. My wife and I, we are happy together. Whatever's going on with that guy over there, it's not serious. I want my marriage back. Will you marry me? No! No, no, no, no, no! No. If you could just wait, please um, Isabel and I are in the middle of something. I will not wait while another man proposes to my wife! Uh, I can explain. You keep saying that and your explanations don't seem to make any sense. He thinks I'm single. He doesn't remember meeting you last night. Oh, no, no, I do r-- I remember that part. I know he's your husband. I j-- I just couldn't remember how I got here or how I hurt my hand or-- or you know, whether we played charades or anything. You-- you know, I'm married. He's just your first husband. Or m-- maybe second. Have there-- have there been any others? Oh, no, no, no, just the one. I can't believe this. So maybe I should make my intentions clearer. After you've divorced him, will you marry me? Well, congratulations. I have to give it to you, babe, you pulled it off. You won the bet. You promised you wouldn't say anything. What-- what bet? Oh, he needs to know. Please. My wife and I had a little argument in that restaurant that Saturday night and she bet me that she could get the next guy who came through the door to propose to her. You mean a-- You mean after I'd walked through. You mean a-- You mean after she'd seen me. No. This was in the golden age before we even knew you existed. So could've been anyone, buddy. God, Cal. Is that true? Yes. - [Max] It was Thursday. - [Jennifer] It was Wednesday. - I'm sure it was Thursday. - I just cannot take much more of this, okay? You always say important things happen on Thursday. Nothing happens on Thursdays. I'm just statin' a fact, it was Thursday! Could you let me finish, please? Cal, tell him that the days of the week are important. Leave him alone. Cal. Cal? Cal? He agrees. Stop! I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I know I behaved like a total ass. And I can tell you why I did it. - It's because my team lost. - What? I was reading about the game on my phone in the restaurant, it was a really big loss, and they were supposed to win, and I-- I just took it out on you like a total jerk. Yeah, maybe you shouldn't have said a few things or done few things, but I uh-- don't need to talk about that, because I am the one who started it, and I am the one who kept makin' it happen, so... You know, I honestly thought I was being funny, but I wasn't. I was being cruel. So yeah, I have not been behaving well. But that does not mean I don't love you. You already knew I wasn't you know, Prince Charming. But uh, I've loved you since the first time we ever-- Actually, it was-- let me think. Four, five weeks after we first met. You were sitting in the corner, and I was talking to someone else, and I was watching you, thinking, I always like talking to her. Isabel. "I mean she's really pretty, but it's not just that. I enjoy her company." I liked you, because you didn't play games. You didn't flirt, and then act hard to get, and all that crap. You were just you. Then I end up giving you a hard time for being the exactly the woman I fell in love with. I would really like another chance. I mean, come on, if women ended their marriages just because men were a bit of an asshole sometimes, there wouldn't be any marriage, right? But I will-- I will try to be less of an asshole. Hand on my heart. And I know I am lucky to be the man that you said "yes" to on that hill with the sun going down. And I will never let myself forget that again. So... ...what do you say? Would you like to come over for dinner tonight? Maybe 06:00? At 6:00? Yeah, I'll be there. It was only dislocated, but try not to use it until the pain subsides. Could be a few weeks. And you have to reduce your stress, Mr. Mace. Here are your prescriptions. Be sure to take them as scheduled. So your-- your next appointment is on the 8th, it's on this card. Do you understand me, Mr. Mace? I'm not stupid. See you tomorrow. It's 4:30. I thought I'd get an early start on the evening. You're-- you're usually the last one to leave. And you seem... ...happy. What do you mean? You've been miserable. Oh, have I? Well, let's see how I am tomorrow, shall we? - [Phone ringing] - Oh, excuse me. Oh. Hello. [Albert] Yes, I'm nearly done! Jesus! Oh. I told you I would leave the keys on the counter, you didn't need to come in person. Oh, no, no, no. Go away. Go-- - Albert, please. I-- - What? What do you want? You'd-- hmm? Which-- I don't know what part this is of your sick bet. What do you actually-- actually you have to pry the ring out of my fingers? You and your husband have laughed at me enough. I'm here because that doctor from the hospital called. What? I-- I gave my number as your contact person, you weren't in any fit state to fill out the forms, so I-- I didn't know who else to put. Oh, I suppose he's told you everything. No, there's confidentiality. He-- he just asked me if I was still in touch with you. He seemed worried. Yeah, well, you can see what's happened. I have dislocated my shoulder. And I'm moving out. People move out with a bad shoulder. So you can go back to your husband. - Why are you moving? - 'Cause... 'Cause I lost my job and I can't pay the rent. Oh. And I've spent all my savings on care for my mom and-- and then-- The ring. You know, I shouldn't have had it engraved. Where are you going? I don't care where I'm going. Hey, hey. Come on. Come on. Yeah. - [Jennifer] Oh, hey! - Hi. Max is working late tonight, I thought we'd get some Chinese food in. - What do you like? - Oh, I'm going out tonight. Oh, you are? - I have a date. - You have a date? Yeah. Oh, if you're ever looking for someone to have dinner with, I'm free. Anytime. Who is she? Isabel. You're getting back together? Well, I'm hoping so. My first date with Isabel was incredible and I'm hoping this one would be even better. Me, too. - Here we go, uh. - Oh, yeah. - Let's get this on. - Okay. Alright. Alrighty. Oh, what a suit! - Okay? - Yep. Oh. How do I look? - Stunning. - Thank you. Go get her. Yeah. Doesn't look like you're getting back together. Unless that first date was a threesome. I had a threesome once in a hot tub. Three's a funny number, you know? It's hard to know where your turn is. [Cal] Do you think she did that on purpose? Got him to move in tonight, after inviting me over to dinner just to get back at me? I don't know, hon. But I warned you. [Phone chiming] "We'll have to make it another night." Man, that is cold. So what should I do? Well, an evening alone with me is not so bad, is it? I'll get the booze. Got you an extra blanket, some towels, and a toothbrush. - Anything else you need? - No. I suppose I should say "thank you". No, this is my fault, so uh... - No. - I won't be staying long, so you don't need to worry. Well, if it helps for a few nights. Whatever I can do. And your husband, I didn't see him. Do I have to worry that he'll burst in the door in the middle of the night and shout rude things at me? That's not gonna happen. Oh! Yeah. God. Still nothin'. I feel like my life is ending. Well... Maybe-- It's just beginning. Hmm? Jennifer, no. I think that's Max. Oh, I don't care, let him find us. No, no. Oh God, I should never get drunk. Nothing good comes out of getting drunk after you're 30. Oh, no. It's okay. No, no. This is so right! Jennifer, no! What if Isabel finds out? - Max is my friend. - It doesn't matter. He won't care! - Please. - I don't care. Don't tell him anything happened. So my asshole boss, right, he says, "Redo the spreadsheet." I redo the spreadsheet. He says, "Redo it again." I said, "It's 9 o' fucking clock." He said, "Is that all?" Beer, yes! Hope you saved some for me. Is there anything to eat? I'm starving. There's some Chinese in the kitchen. Uh, Jennifer's not feeling well. That woman's never feeling well. - Oh, sorry. - Excuse me. I'll get out of-- I'll get out of your way. - Sorry. - Sorry. - I was just making coffee. - Oh no, make yourself at home. - No, I didn't-- I didn't-- - Well, I can do that. I didn't want you to wait on me. I'm-- I-- I should probably leave for work. - So there's a spare key in the drawer. - Oh yeah, thank you. Uh-- I'll pro-- I'll probably be out um, job hunting. Would you-- no rush with your shoulder. No, uh-- uh, so I can get out of your hair. - I'll be bringing dinner in, so you don't have to-- - No, you-- you don't-- It's-- really you don't need to. I'm fine. Fine, fine. Alright. - I really can't let you-- - Oh please, sit down. We can't eat in shifts, it would be absurd. Just to say since I am staying here, I am experiencing difficulties in my job search due to my former employer giving me a bad reference. I had hoped to find something immediately. That's okay. No, it's not. So then I said, "That's not the way to do it." And he says, "Well, that's how I want it done." I mean I'm no fool, I know what I'm doin'. Deserve some respect, right? [Isabel] Oh. Oh. Good night. Oh you-- you don't have to do that. Oh, it was no problem. With one arm, it probably was. I was gonna watch an old movie. Do you wanna... Oh, I don't think so. You sure? - Good night. - Good night. Oh, I-- I thought I might make my um, lasagna tonight. - Would that be okay? - Oh, you don't have to do that. No, I-- I mean I-- I'd like to. That would be nice. Thanks. Well, wait till you've tasted it, you might change your mind. Bye. Bye. Oh God. I hate to say this, bro, it's just not looking good for you right now. Yeah, maybe I should get myself an apartment. But that would make it real. I'm not sure I'm ready for it to be real yet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, listen you're more than welcome to stay here as long as you want. And Jennifer loves the company. Haven't see her this happy in ages. Hmm, thanks, man. So you just have the one son. Yeah, Colin. He always wanted to travel and now he's doing it. It's hard, though, I miss him. But you've got to let them grow up. My mother never wanted me to travel. She was heartbroken when I came here. But she had a cat. Billy Bob. I think she saw Billy Bob as my brother. In fact, I'm pretty sure he was her favorite. Poor old sweet Billy Bob was the stupidest cat you ever saw. We used to live near these ducks and, you know, I was always afraid he would attack them. So I used to pick him up every time we walked past. But I think he thought I was protecting him rather than the other way around. And then from then onward whenever we went past the ducks, he used to leap into my arms. Aw! You were such a great big brother to Billy Bob. My mom and dad had a cat, when they first got married. And there is a picture of the two them holding it. The cat's name was Isabel. It's not like they named me after a cat, it's just they liked the name "Isabel", so they used it for their baby as well. But they always used to say, "This is us with Isabel." So I thought it was a picture of me. But I was a cat before I grew into a little girl. And um, I was in the playground one day, telling all the other kids that I used to be a cat, and asking them what animal they used to be. And my mom had to break the news to me that I was never a cat. Yep. Think I'm still getting over the disappointment. That is a nice story. You know, I never told anyone before. I'd love to meet Billy Bob. You look like him? Yeah, we were twins. Well, thank you again. Oh, you don't have to thank me. Jack's a friend. He-- he's a nice guy. And he knows I've got a bad reference? Yeah, I told him everything. Well, not-- not everything. But uh, about your mom, just to explain why you were angry that day, and that you-- more-- you're more interested in product management than sales anyway. He said he's happy to interview you. Well... ...wish me luck tomorrow. You don't need it. Oh, we all need some luck. Okay, that's true. Better get to bed. I mean you know, it's um-- It's late. Yeah. Good night. Good night. Oh... Oh, I should go to bed. Just going up the stairs seems like too much effort. I shouldn't have had that third glass of wine. Well, we are celebrating. Yes, we are. Tomorrow, I have to get out my best suit. - Clean my shoes. - Hmm. I never believed I'd get that job. I thought there was only bad news ahead for me. I used-- I mean I've-- I've never made it. But-- But before my mother was sick and when I had my old job... I think I was a different man. I wish you'd known me then. [Jennifer] You have no idea what has been going on behind your back. Do you? You have no idea that we were making out right on that couch the night that you came home late from work. You walked right in, you didn't even notice! What? Tell him, honey. Tell him. Hey! Is that true? What's up? [Door opening] I'm back home. Good night. Good night. [Doorbell ringing] I don't want Max to see me. God knows what he'd do to us. - Oh God, Jennifer. - Oh! [Jennifer] I just hate living there without you. Please, come back. I love you. I love you. This is not what it looks like. Yes, it is. [Pounding on door] [Jennifer] Oh shit! I guess I should open that. You were my best friend. - Come on, I'm not really your best friend, but-- - My best friend! What's going on? Did he tell you why I kicked him out? Huh? The two of them were makin' out in my own home! I thought we could fix things, but now she's sneakin' off to his bed in the middle of the night! Nothing ever happened between me and Jennifer, nothing is happening. Honey, you don't have to lie. If you didn't want me, then you wouldn't have stayed! Because-- Oh my God, that kiss was the greatest kiss of my life. That's not accurate. Isabel. Get out. No, but-- Get out! Isabel. You really don't want me? Oh fuck! Please, don't stand there and gloat. I was drunk. She kissed me. I pushed her away. Yeah, I know, you don't believe me. No one believes me. Hell, what does it matter? Once I made that idiot bet, Isabel was never gonna forgive me. I'm sorry about that. Yeah. In the end, you won the bet. You won my wife. Well, it's just us again. Actually, now I have gotten my job, I'll be able to find another place. Oh. Well, there's-- there's no hurry. No, well, I n-- I never wanted you or-- or anyone else to feel obligated to me. I know, but-- Friends help friends. I suppose um-- I don't want to be late for my first day. Hmm. Why don't you and I-- I don't know how to say this. Why don't you and I... ...go out together this evening? I have an apartment to see at 06:00 and then we could maybe meet at 07:00 at the restaurant where we met? See ya. Mr. Mace, hello again. It's um, my first day on a new job today, so if we could just get this over with quickly, I-- Uh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I-- I have your test results. I'm afraid your-- your heart is not the heart of a teenager. But if you manage to keep your stress levels down, watch your diet, and take your medications, which I understand you only started a few days ago, then you should have many adventures ahead of you in life. Thank you. You're very welcome. You know, I-- I-- I hope I never see you again. Hi. Hi. [Cal] Oh.
