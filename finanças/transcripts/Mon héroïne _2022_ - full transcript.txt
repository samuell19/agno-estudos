(IN ENGLISH) Hello, my name is Alex Trofel, and I'm calling from France. So sorry to bother you, but I sent my application a while ago, and I wanted to know the result because the letter never arrived. WOMAN ON PHONE: I'm sorry, miss. This is not the way we do things. Yes, I understand, but make an exception, just to check the computer, check the list? Please. It is very important to me. WOMAN ON PHONE: Very sorry, miss. Have a good day. Sorry, my ass! Bitch! (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER ROUEN UNIVERSITY ECONOMICS COURSE OCTOBER (ENGINE SPUTTERING) (ENGINE DIES) Shit! (ENGINE UNABLE TO START) Shit! I have no idea! (YELLING) Fuck! A stranger approaches you in the street. You smile at him, you run away, or you kiss him passionately? -I smile. -You smile. So that makes a total of... yes, twenty-two squares. You're a sensitive person who can be counted on, but who's afraid of the unknown. That's totally you! -Yeah? -Crazy, huh? My turn. Have you ever made love in a pool, in a hotel, with all your clothes on? If I tick all three, it messes up the result. That's dumb! -(DOOR OPENS) -I'll do it, anyway. You took your time! (DOOR CLOSES) Explain. -What? -Don't even try. New York Film Academy... Accepted? Cool! No, it's too late! I had to confirm two months ago! It's over. Great, Mom! What's all this about the New York Academy? What don't you understand? New York Film Academy, Alexandra Trofel, accepted! So you hide my mail? -You moron! -Don't talk to me like that! I didn't even know this letter existed. That's enough! Going to New York on your own... That's why I didn't tell you! You'd have never let me go! I don't know, but you should at least talk to me. There's the money... You chose to rot in Rouen, that's your problem. But this is my life, my choice. That was my dream. Your life's boring. You're boring. That's why Dad left you. I've done my best, Alex. As a kid, dreams of making movies with Julia Roberts was cute. Today, it's just pathetic. You really think they're waiting for you in New York? Honestly? Alex! Alex! (DOOR SLAMS) You really didn't see the letter? Don't you start! No, I didn't! Would you have given it to her? Are you serious? Fuck! -Not now, please. -Yes. I'm going to add my two cents. You were pretty nasty. Is it really too late? It's too late. So... what do we do? I don't know. Next year I'll find a job. I'll work at the movie theater, selling popcorn. At least I'll get to see movies for free. You drama queen! You don't want to see movies, you want to work in movies. Granny would have understood. When you're down, there's always Julia. So... Pretty Woman? Come on. We'll cut straight to the part with the bitches. That's really funny. It'll cheer you up. Come on. (MOUTHING DIALOGUE TO FILM) -Do you remember me? -No, I'm sorry. You wouldn't wait on me yesterday. -You work on commission, right? -Yes. JULIA IN FILM: Big mistake! Big! Huge! We'll go meet Julia Roberts. Really? She has a production company in New York. We'll go meet Julia Roberts in New York! Sorry, I didn't get that. I thought you were dreaming up impossible stuff. Like some totally crazy idea. But no! Not tomorrow. I have a meeting with my boss that I really cannot miss. I have the address. And we need to talk to Deborah Ward. Great! Talking with you, one really feels listened to. It's a joy, really! New York, why not? I've never been... Hi, everyone. Hi, Julia. My name is Alex Trofel and this is my story. I'll go to the store after work. Do you want anything? (COMPUTER BEEPS) Tickets for Julia and New York! We're staying at the Carlton... -ALEX ON PHONE: Hello? -Alex, what's that? Our tickets for New York. Don't ask questions. I used Granny's money and sold my video camera. -What? -We leave today. JULIETTE ON PHONE: You're crazy! Your mom will have a heart attack, and I'm at work. -I'm about to go to a meeting. -ALEX ON PHONE: I'm going anyway. Alex, not on your own, you're only 19... It's so far away, don't! ALEX ON PHONE: Then come with me, I need you. -JULIETTE: Stay... -(DOOR OPENS) Uh... (SNAPS FINGERS) You... the meeting is starting. Coming. Alex, stay right where you are, okay? I'll call you back. MAN: November is very good. February is shit! Why? No one knows, no one has an answer, of course. In March it picks up. Surprising, but true. And after... it goes down. Down, down, down, down... (MAN EXCLAIMS) We're down 250,000 euros. Where are you going? I'm leaving, I think. Leaving where? I don't understand. I have a plane to catch. So I'm leaving. And I have to say that... all of this... the months... I don't give a shit. I seriously don't give a shit! It's so boring! It really bores the shit out of me, Jean-Phi! Yes, it's boring. Everyone's sick of it. Good luck, guys! See you! -Juliette. -Yes? You're fired! Fired. Okay. Can I say one last thing? Go ahead. Yes, very clever. Right, which month? Fuck! Fuck! What the hell! JULIETTE: Alex! ALEX: Hurry up, we'll miss our flight! (PANTING) ALEX: Come on, they're boarding, we don't want to miss it. JULIETTE: Wait...

Hi, Juju. Yes! I'm calling to tell you that Alex will be spending a few days with me. I didn't know. Not that she's talking to me, so... Is she at yours now? Yes, she is. It'll do the two of you good. I'll take good care of her. Okay. Are you at the office? Yes, I'm at the office. Of course. FLIGHT ATTENDANT ON LOUDSPEAKER: Your attention, please. Where are you? I don't understand. I'm at the office. It's that idiot, Jean-Phi. His stupid imitations. Stop it, Jean-Phi! (JULIETTE LAUGHING) He's such an idiot! Juliette, come on! Mathilde, I can't hear you, I can't hear you at all. -Are you in a tunnel? -No. Wait, Juliette, wait! -Can you hear me? -I hear you loud and clear. Juliette... How can you be in such a long tunnel? There aren't any tunnels like that. Ciao, gotta go. Juliette, I hear you very... Hello? Sorry. -You nearly made us miss it. -What the hell! JULIETTE: Hold on. Airplane mode. There! -What's going on? -Are you okay? I don't know, it's my sister. She said she's at work, but I heard "last call for New York." Weird! I wouldn't like to go there. Why? Don't you watch Law &amp; Order: SVU? -Yeah, so? -It's based on real life! -There's a rape on every street corner! -Nonsense, it's TV! -It takes place in New York. -But it's not real life. -No, I don't believe it! -I'll be right back. -PASSENGER: Bravo! -(ALL APPLAUDING) There must be some movies with Julia Roberts. Guess who stopped off at duty free. That's why you nearly missed the flight! No, because someone sent me a message at 9:00 a.m. saying, "Quick, we have a plane to catch!" Here. No, that's a bad idea. (IN ENGLISH) Ladies and gentleman, this is your captain speaking. (IN FRENCH) Please, you must drink some alcohol! Thanks. ALL: No! Sorry, I misread it. It's 6 but I read it as 9. It was upside-down. That's my seat. Okay. MILLA: It's Alex's mom, what do we do? -We say nothing and go. -MILLA: Okay. MATHILDE: Adèle! -Adèle! -Oh, hi, Mathilde. NOAH AND MILLA: Hi, Mrs. Trofel. I think Alex has gone to New York with my sister. I don't know what got into them. -Did she say anything? -No. -She didn't tell you anything at all? -No. If anything happens to her, I'll hold you responsible. She's gone to meet Julia Roberts. Where can she be contacted? Did she leave an address or something? I said it was dumb. The probability of finding Julia Roberts in New York... Shut up! She didn't tell you? Okay, I'll manage. Thanks. Sorry. Mathilde. -Is something wrong? -Yes. I think this is a big mistake. It's not gonna work. Mom will be so mad at me. And I've dragged you along too. Alex, I've dealt with your mom. It'll be fine. And Julia Roberts will be so nice when... I won't meet her! And if you don't meet her... Listen to me! It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. We're going to New York. That's great! If it doesn't work out, there's plenty to do. Times Square, Manhattan, breakfast at Tiffany's, the Statue of Liberty, SoHo, Little Italy... Yes, I get it, there's lots to do. Whatever happens, it'll be fine. Okay? It'll be fine. I'm going to the bathroom. But it'll be fine. Okay. JULIETTE ON P.A.: Welcome aboard this flight to New York. The outside temperature is minus 425,755 degrees Celsius. So it's very, very cold! Now I'd like to send a personal message to Alex! She's on her way to New York to meet Julia Roberts.

MATHILDE: I'm just calling to tell you your daughter has run off to New York, without letting me know, so I'm going too. I don't know how much it costs. I'll sell Mom's ring. Don't know what to tell the hospital but I'll sort it out myself, as always. I have no choice. Don't even know why I called you. AUTOMATED VOICE: Message deleted. Fuck! -Please, not today! -(ENGINE STARTS) Thanks, Mom. Have a nice flight. ALEX ON PHONE: It's Alex, leave me a message. -Hello, sir. -Hello, welcome to Air Liberty. Thank you. How can I help you?

"The best I can do" is a 10:00 p.m. flight via Stockholm. -Will that be okay? -Isn't Stockholm sort of... New York is more... It's completely... No, that's boarding. After that, it's Stockholm, then the Atlantic Ocean and then, it's New York. So? So how much, to do that? 450 euros. One hundred, two hundred, three hundred and fifty... Don't worry, no one else in this airport is in a hurry! Now I've lost count, I'll have to start again. One, two, three hundred and fifty... four hundred, and that's four hundred and fifty. You can count it again. No, I trust you. Have a nice flight. Thank you very much. And boarding is... Still there! Thank you. Bye. Wait! HUGUES: Wait! I want to know how your story ends.

There. A wonderful view. Nothing obstructing it. One small problem. The phone. -It's been... -Eaten. I don't think it'll work. I'll go downstairs and call from there. No, wait for me! Oh, my God, stop. No, she did not say that. You're lying to me. Can you just hold on one sec? Yeah, just one sec. Thank you. -Yeah? -Hello. It's us again. When you're finished, can we use the phone, please? This phone is not for guests. The phone you can use is over there. -On the left. -Okay, thank you. Very nice. ALEX: (IN FRENCH) What a nasty bitch, I hate her. Great. A 250-year-old phone. There's no dial tone, it's out. Maybe... (DIAL TONE) -Of course. -That was easy! -It's ringing! -It's ringing.

(IN FRENCH) I'm like Erin Brockovich, I won't give up! -What was that? -Just some crazy French girl. -ALEX: I will be back! -I'll take care of this. Okay, I'm going to take it from here. Thank you. All right, come with me. You are the French girl that called me yesterday. Yeah, it's me. You're Thea? I am. All right. Go right in here. -The thing is just that I... -(SHUSHES) Now, you listen. I mean... (IN FRENCH) As I said on the phone, I... your screenplay... I can't... (IN ENGLISH) You need an agent, okay? The rules are the rules. (IN FRENCH) I understand, but I don't have an agent. Just read it and tell me what you think. (IN ENGLISH) I'm sorry. I can't. I'm going to lose my job. (IN ENGLISH) Please. (IN FRENCH) I live for movies. Truly. And Julia Roberts made me love movies. You're my only hope. (IN ENGLISH) Okay. I'm going to see you after the junket. (IN ENGLISH) Okay. What? (IN FRENCH) And you can tell me about your screenplay. ALEX: (IN ENGLISH) Yes, of course. Okay, so which hotel are you staying at? (IN FRENCH) At the Carlton in Hell's Kitchen. This is my screenplay, with the link for the video of intent. -Yes. -Okay. -I'm going to leave you a message. -Okay. (IN FRENCH) And very important, absolutely important, you say nothing to no one. I say nothing to no one. -Silent? -(IN ENGLISH) Yeah, silent. -I'm serious! -Me too, I'm serious! I say nothing to no one. Okay, now go. (LAUGHING) -Great! -Okay, now go. -Go. -I go. ALEX: (SHOUTING) Yes! JULIETTE: I'll say it one last time, yes, I lied to you, I'm sorry. Enough already! -But you wouldn't have let us go. -MATHILDE: I would have! -You would? -Yes. -Why are you here, then? -Because... My daughter's all alone, what if something happens to her? JULIETTE: She's not alone. Who do you take me for? I'm a grown up. MATHILDE: You're not her mother! JULIETTE: I'm not, but she came to me! Weird, huh? She'd have come here anyway, so I might as well be with her. And I'm glad I'm here. -Cool, isn't it? -Great. JULIETTE: Stop it, just leave it there. You're a pain, huh? This is crazy. JULIETTE: It's great that you're here. How's the jetlag? -MATHILDE: I'm okay, so far. -Yeah? I'm just peachy, it's amazing! I'm going to take a shower. Where's the bathroom? (JULIETTE SNORING) Hello. Do you have a message for Alex? Alex? One second. Hey, babe. Here you go. Hello? -Alex? -Yeah. -You're Alex? -Yes. I thought Alex was a boy. (IN FRENCH) She pisses me off! From Thea. "Meet at the Beverly." That place is fancy. It's like a total scene. The hottest place in New York City. Influencers, celebrities, investment bankers. You need to change. (IN FRENCH) I'll find something. Wait, do you want to borrow something of mine? -No. -Are you sure? -Yes. -I have another jacket. -You can totally borrow it. -ALEX: Never in my entire life, never. RECEPTIONIST: Let me know if you change your mind. -We're here to help! -(DOOR SLAMS) MATHILDE: Alex, wait! You're impossible! -Can't we talk for a minute? -No. Alex, Alex! Are you sure you don't want to borrow my earrings? -MATHILDE: Alex, that's enough! -Not now! I have the right to talk to you! ALEX: I'm meeting someone from Julia's office. You can tell me off later, not now! -You're not going out alone at night. -Fine. -No problem. -MATHILDE: Great. -ALEX: Fine. -All right. Wait for me here, okay? I may be a while. You're in Times Square, go see a musical. -The Book of Mormon. -MATHILDE: What? Or The Lion King. See you! Don't worry about me, I'll wait here. Just go! (PLAYING PIANO) (CHUCKLES) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hi, Deb. DEBORAH ON PHONE: How dare you let a crazy French fan -in the hotel... -THEA: Calm down. -No, of course not. -(DEBORAH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) But it was the only way to save us from a scandal at the junket. Yeah, I do know no unsolicited... I'd never. No, of course. Deborah, I'd never risk my job. (DEBORAH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) This girl means nothing. It was just a way to let her down easy. Such a waste of electricity. I'm sorry your meeting didn't work out. Mom, please. I don't want to talk about it. You were right. Happy now? Of course I'm not happy. Can you tell me what happened? What did she say? I suck. I shouldn't have come here. Look at what you've achieved, it's fantastic. You met with someone from Julia's office. It didn't work out, but next time it will. There won't be a next time! If you throw in the towel at the first hitch... You'll make it, I'm sure. -How do you know? -I just do. Because I know you. Because you're extraordinary. Because I believe in you. Because you're my daughter. And since I'm awesome, you must have inherited some of that. I know you didn't hide my letter. I know. Don't worry about it. Are you cold? Yeah. MATHILDE: Come on, let's go back. Juju will be worried. Shall we go? ALEX: Yeah. She really does look worried. (SNORING) Girls! Up you get, come on! Stop it! Did you meet Julia? What's she like? Come on, get moving! ALEX: No, we're going to sleep all day. Are you serious? We're in New York! Let's make the most of it! MATHILDE: Do so on your own. On my own? For once we can all do something together. Come on! MATHILDE: Stop it! We'll do a city tour so you can sleep on the bus. -ALEX: All right. -Okay? -MATHILDE: Okay. -Dibs on the shower! She's insane. -JULIETTE: That's all you know? -MATHILDE: She won't tell me anything. -JULIETTE: Did you see the woman? -MATHILDE: No, Alex came straight out. All I know is, she was from Julia's office. ALEX: I know you're talking about me. I don't want to talk about it now, but I'll be fine. Of course you'll be fine. Where's this bus? -She said on the left. -That's right. -ALEX: This is left. -Oh, yeah. JULIETTE: It'll leave soon, so we better hurry. Welcome back, Thea. Rough night? Julia's coming at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow. Yeah, thanks, Kate. I'm sorry. I thought we were really late, but we're early. (MIC FEEDBACK) GUIDE ON MIC: Hello, New York! -(CLAPPING) -You're too nice!

Then stop calling me! I love you very much, kisses! Sick. (DOOR OPENS) Who's that? That French girl again? -Yeah. -Is her script even any good? -Well, it's got a lot of potential. -We don't have time for that. Do you have anything else? I warned you. You're fired. I'm going to need your notes on that before the meeting tomorrow. -Then you're out of here. -But that's unfair. Life's unfair. Get back to work. OMG! We're approaching our first stop! (ALL CHEERING) Wait for it. It's the shop where Charlotte buys her "rabbit." (ALL EXCLAIMING) All right, so let's get up, and let's shop, shop! (ALL CHEERING) Okay, let's go girls. And don't be shy. Come on in. -MATHILDE: What did she say? -JULIETTE: It's gonna be vibrant. You've gotta check it out. Get in there. Have fun. MATHILDE: What's this, Alex ? -(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN) -ALEX: Mom, it's a nipple clamp! A present! -MATHILDE: Please, no. -JULIETTE: Yes! The pleasure is mine. What is this? Very appropriate! -It's alive! -Great, huh? That'll be ten years of therapy! Let's go. Not right now, thanks. No, don't shoot, I surrender! -Listen, it sounds like a sledgehammer. -(BAG VIBRATING) My favorite! Thank you! -Oh, you look amazing! -Thank you. -Stay sweet. -You too.

Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I've got one more thing. I know, this is not the way we do things. But there is this French girl, I mean, she came all the way from France to New York, to give you her script. -She was actually in here... -We've got more important things to do. We don't have time for this. Please leave. Sorry about that, Julia. You know what? Fuck it. We are here to tell people's stories, to make them dream. So let's just that, right? And she made this video for you. YOUNG ALEX IN VIDEO: Are we rolling? Hello, Julia, it's Alex. You don't know me yet... JULIA IN FILM: So why are you calling me? -I want to make a film with you. -JULIA IN FILM: All right. (IN ENGLISH) Julia, if I could call you like I used to when I was 10 years old I'd do it in a heartbeat, but I live in the real world, even if my mom thinks I don't. So I'm making you this video. I grew up alone with my mother. And when I got my first camera, I used to film her almost every day. GRANNY: (IN FRENCH) Can you help us instead of filming? ALEX: (IN ENGLISH) And when I was a kid, she used to take me to see all of your films. And now that I'm grown up... I think, I hope, I'm ready to start my own dream. THE CAKE And my dream is to make a movie with you. Please, say yes. I know this sounds crazy but... Julia is here until 6:00 p.m. Make it happen. (PHONE RINGING) Carlton Arms Hotel, what can I do for you? Hi, I'd like to speak to Alex Trofel, please. The French girl? Yeah, they're gone. Gone? Where are they going? RECEPTIONIST ON PHONE: The airport I guess? Did they leave a number? Yes, 0606... It looks like a bug. -Is it candy? -Yes. MATHILDE: It stinks. Horrible! (CELL PHONE RINGING) Who's calling me? Shit, I can't find it! Help me. -(VIBRATOR VIBRATING) -What are you doing with this? -Thought you'd be bored on the plane? -Exactly. Stop, don't get it out! -(VIBRATING) -(LAUGHING) Stop. -I'll put it in that guy's bag. -Don't! You really want to keep it, right? Stop. Wait a sec. -AUTOMATED VOICE: You have a message. -I don't understand. Take good care of it. It's Thea. Hold on, it's Thea. -For me? -No, it's for Alex. She says Pocahontas wants to meet her. She's leaving at 6:00 p.m. so she has to be there earlier. Someone named their kid Pocahontas? Who? I don't get it. Where is the world going? It's nuts. Fuck, it's Julia Roberts! It's her code name in Notting Hill, remember? Yes! What do we do? -Nothing. -We have to tell her. Of course we have to! Go get her! Alex, come on. -MATHILDE: Come on. -We're boarding. MATHILDE: Come on, please! CAB DRIVER: Sorry, ma'am, my shift is over for the day. -What did he say? -His shift is over. -We'll miss our flight. -Get in! -Come on! -Just explain. -Please! -Just tell me... -Get the fuck in! -Okay. How do you say urgent? -(IN ENGLISH) It's an emergency! -I said, get the fuck out of here! -MATHILDE: (IN ENGLISH) You go, okay? -Stay calm, don't shoot! (IN FRENCH) Fuck, Mom, have you totally lost it? Amazing, Mathilde! Amazing? Are you crazy? We'll all end up in jail! MATHILDE: (IN FRENCH) How do you say start? Stay calm. -(IN ENGLISH) Start. -MATHILDE: (IN ENGLISH) Start! Quick! -JULIETTE: (IN FRENCH) You are amazing! -ALEX: (IN FRENCH) Stop saying that! JULIETTE: Watch out for that lady! No word yet, but I promise I'll keep you posted. Okay, thanks, Kate. -Did you find the girl? -I left a message. -Julia's got to go any minute now. -I know. -She's got another appointment. -Get off my back! Careful, you're beginning to sound like me. Oh, by the way, you're not fired anymore if this girl turns out to be worth it. ALEX: (IN FRENCH) Just explain what's going on. -Mom, stop that. -Shut up. Here, listen to this. THEA OVER VOICEMAIL: Hi, this is Thea from Shoelace Productions. I'm calling for Alex. I have quite exciting news. Miss Pocahontas wants to meet you now. Like right now. She's at the office till 6:00 p.m. Come running! (IN ENGLISH) Oh, my God! Go, go, go! Go fast, please! (LAUGHING) They've lost it. Yes, totally lost it. We're stuck. -MATHILDE: How long do we have? -I don't know. -I don't know, but we're stuck. -We have five minutes. I'm gonna miss it! Alex, calm down. Alex, calm down, stop. What the... hell is that? Give me that fucking thing! -Get the fuck out of my taxi! -Sorry! -Get the fuck out! Get out of here! -MATHILDE: (IN FRENCH) Let's go! -Get out, you French fucking bitches! -(IN ENGLISH) We're not bitches! Whatever, get out! Bye, Julia! Wait for me. Don't wait. This is it. JULIETTE: Wait. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) ALEX: I'm going up. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) Wow! Oh, fuck! Fuck! What? Shit! (BELLS TOLLING) 6 years later You went to New York to meet Julia Roberts. Pretty crazy! I think I wanted to prove I could do it. I went to New York with a screenplay for Julia Roberts and I came back with a movie for me. -So your dream is coming true. -That's exactly right. Which one do you prefer? That one's great. Thanks. -Thank you, I think that's it. -Great. -Can't wait to see the movie. -Thank you, bye. -Alex, is everything okay? -Great. People from Universal are coming to visit the set tomorrow. That's great. -Hello. -No way! -How are you? -Good. This is Matthieu, the producer. This is the famous Hugues. MATTHIEU: Hugues Grand? I thought you'd be smaller. -(IN ENGLISH) Hey, French girl! -(IN ENGLISH) I'm so glad you came! Of course! Are you kidding? (IN FRENCH) I have a little something for you. ALEX: What? All right. From Julia. ALEX: Awesome! -JULIETTE: How are you? -Good. JULIETTE: I think we're sitting over here. It brings back memories. -I'll leave you with Nico. -Mathilde? Come with me. -Am I late? -No, we're still rehearsing. We haven't started shooting. Please sit here. Do you want to listen? Yes. Can I? I'll plug it in. There. Thanks. ALEX OVER HEADSET: So, let's rehearse. She says, "She's not a hooker, she's Julia." ACTOR: Did she really say that? "She's not a hooker, she's Julia." ALEX: Yes. You haven't met my mom yet. I'll introduce you. She's going to be an extra. No one messes with her daughter! So... Let's go back to the scene. As it's the at beginning, I really want to define my mom's character. She raised me on her own, she's a bit of a control freak, always worrying. She's always present, sometimes a bit too much, but... I don't want her to come across as being too strict. In fact, she's both a sweetheart and a pain. Like all mothers. That's right. To be fair, I was a total pain myself. I was obsessed with movies, it was all I talked about. But in the end, she was always there for me. It's because of her and no one else that I'm making this movie today. Even though she comes across as tough, she's quite fragile. This film is for her. She's the actual heroine. She's my heroine. -Are you okay? -Yes. And you? Sit over here. Matthieu, can you take her? See you later. HUGUES: Sorry, that's my seat. (IN ENGLISH) Oh, you want to sit down. Sorry. Go ahead. (IN FRENCH) This is Hugues. Hugues, this is Mathilde, my sister, Alex's mom. -Right! -Pleased to meet you. -The director's mom? -Yes. -Slightly nervous? -A bit. But I'll be fine. -We have to trade places. -Why? We weren't sitting like this. We have to swap, otherwise it's not right for... continuity. You see? We absolutely have to swap. This won't work. It'll be... yeah. They got it wrong. -That's better. -Okay. -Yeah, we weren't... -Of course. ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Silence! -Are we ready? -ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: In a minute. We were right to dress her as a hooker. It worked. Sorry, she's not a hooker, she's Julia Roberts. -JULIETTE: Thank you very much. -(CELL PHONE RINGING) Mom, Auntie! Phones off! It wasn't us. It was the gentleman in front of us. ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Everyone, back to one! Thanks! NICO: Extras are ready, good to roll. ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Alex, whenever you're ready. Rolling? Mark. 34/2, take 1. We're rolling! Silence! Action! To my mom In 2001, Noémie Lefort, straight out of film school, went to New York to try and give Julia Roberts the short she'd made for her. -DRIVER: Welcome to New York. -NOÉMIE: Yeah! And she succeeded. THEA: You know, I was just answering my phone, and my assistant stepped away from her desk. And I picked it up and there was this girl, "Hello?" So she sounded so sweet and lovely, and she said she had something for Julia. First of all, we're not allowed to do that. You're not allowed to take something from someone. They have to go through an agent or lawyer. Especially somebody of Julia's level. But she was so sweet, and I said, "I'll make an exception this one time." So I took it from her, but I wasn't supposed to. And so I said, "Of course." I gave her the address. And then she showed up, like, a day later. (IN FRENCH) Shoelace Productions, here I am. Appointment with Thea at 2:00 p.m. Very nervous! (IN ENGLISH) Everybody didn't like it at first. Because they thought maybe she was crazy, some fan, I let her in the office. But once we saw the movie... And it was very well done, very professional, very beautiful, this little movie, everybody was okay. (IN FRENCH) They'll give it to Julia! -NOÉMIE: Julia saw it. -THEA: Yeah, finally. She was very taken by it. She thought it was very sweet. We stayed friends the whole time. Subtitles: Howard Bonsor
