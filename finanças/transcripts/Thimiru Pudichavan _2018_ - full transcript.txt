Come on Thank you, sir Sir, don't look at me.

Your hands are trembling to shoot a street dog When will you go to next level and learn to hide the blade under gums? Chief... it's easier to kill that dog with stones We are not used to gun, chief We already learned the trick of placing blade in the gums Really? Whoa! Padma, the guys are getting better If you keep training them like this for one more month... they will over take you Padma... my son can't even stay a day away from me But now? It's been a week since he came home - Please send him along with me - Mom, just leave! I am scared to death He is shooting dogs today and tomorrow he'll shoot people That's what the training is all about Only then he'll get rid of his fear and start finishing off humans Please Padma, no. Please return my son to me Ask me and I shall pay you some money How much can you afford? I have 10,000 rupees that I saved for my pilgrimage to Tirupathi I'll cancel that and give you that money Also, I'll take the money from my chit fund and pay you Rs. 35,000 altogether Then? Without knowing your son's value... you just want to pay a mere Rs. 35,000? He is one of Padma's men now Your son will earn me 4 crores if he murders four people Can you pay me that much? Never in a lifetime I can make that much or earn that much Then what's the use of you being alive? Saravana... I am ordering you Slit your mother's throat! See that? I'll finish you off with the help of your own son You better leave now Padma! Our police officers aren't the same - They have turned good - Is it?

You're going to take action against Padma without knowing his power I can't join that operation Fear is like conjunctivitis! It'll spread from one's reaction to another You resign and others will follow you I just turned everyone at the station responsible Listen to me Why should I? What if Padma's men attack me with acid? Already, it's hard to find a groom for me because I'm a police and a little tough Don't you know your value and how beautiful you are? See the guy coming in the bike in opposite direction? He is ogling at you Come on, sir! Everything looks beautiful to the eyes that fears to ogle Let's wait. He'll come back before we cross this street For what? To ogle at you! Stop acting innocent You're right, sir See that balcony? A guy will step out hearing your bike's sound H... How do you know all this? I know it - The butterflies... - Yeah... Like how it can't see the colors of it's wings... similarly you aren't able to see how beautiful and graceful you are Correct! When so many have fallen for me... I wonder how many of them love me without my knowledge Remember, even I told you... When I see the good qualities in you... I'm afraid I might fall in love with you Argh, sir! Do you love me or not? I do Really? So, you were speaking the truth? Very good. Thanks But you must wait What if I get someone better than you? Don't think that I'm avoiding you You're confirmed in my waiting list! Bye Madam, please sign in my medical certificate I shall, but will you get admitted? Do you think the department pays me to sign fake certificate, so you can go vacation? Go, mind your work! Murugavel, did you sleep well? I couldn't sleep, ma'am You couldn't sleep?! If you still can't sleep after so many days, that means you're in next phase of Insomnia Are you taking the medicines I prescribed, on time? Yes, I have been taking them properly But I'm unable to sleep Either change the medicine... Else I'll consult a better doctor How dare you? Do you think this is a petty issue like headache or stomachache? To cure immediately as soon as you take medicine This is a mental illness Only you can help yourself You better apply for medical leave tonight and get admitted! You must sleep at least tonight! Else it'll be confirmed that you have Chronic Insomnia Then one by one all your organs will fail and you'll die! Go and do whatever is necessary to get admitted You heard me! Murugavel! Your pressure will drop if you become emotional before getting admitted Get upset and your pressure will raise Then you'll lose your memory and forget everything! If something of that sorts happen, then press your pulse with the thumb. Ok? I don't have the patience, madam Then buy yourself a hand gripper and press it like this Ok? Now leave! Phew! He raised my pressure and turned me into a patient! Sir... I am Ismail I have only a son His name is Majid He has gone rogue after joining under Padma Two years ago, right in front of my shop... Padma murdered a boy Here is the footage from the camera Please, somehow get Padma arrested and save my son from him Change the Tyre Come here, guys Chief... What is it? My father has got a transfer So, I must move along with him Chief... Let me go So, who is the girl? Her name is... Kanmani She smiles every time I cross her I asked her... if she is in love with me And she said 'yes' Hence... she said if I quit working for you... then she shall continue the relationship Chief, I joined you when I was 16 I finished off everyone you asked me to Now, I am a major If I commit any murder now, then I'll be in prison for life So, please let me go Ok Chief Listen... if you leave... you think the police will spare you? Huh? They will ask you to become an informer You just cannot escape from this If you still want to leave... then, either I mus die... Or... you must die Chief... please! No! You want to leave everything just for a girl? Tell me Remember, you finished off Kumar two years ago, in the streets? Yes The incident got recorded in a camera from one of the shops That's not the issue The issue is that Murugavel has got his hands on it He is on his way to meet you. Deal him with caution 'An arrogant fellow' This is your last meal! " 'Meesai' Padma..." "passes away..." "in a police shoot out" Tomorrow's headlines! Before you die... do you have any last wish? A chicken sacrificed it's life for me Can I have it and then die? Please... Police... do you have any idea how much this drink cost? It costs your six months' salary 100 years old... A normal, local thug... has grown rich and powerful enough to afford a 1.5 lakhs worth drink Imagine how many murders I would have committed to reach this stage? And you want to finish me off easily in an encounter? Here you are, sitting in front of me thinking it's easy Now, that you have made up your mind... hear my story before finishing me off There are only two types of people in India #1. People who starve and yearn for a smoke #2. People who eat their heart out and smoke to burp I requested for a cigar from a person, who was smoking after his meal He slapped me and said 'You want to smoke at such a young age?' Starved to the core, yet ego still gets better of us I stabbed him with a piece of bottle I got hands on The police caught me I thought it was all over and I'll be hanged to death Instead, they gave me a good hair cut, turned me smart and released me after two years When I inquired... they said I was a juvenile criminal It seems the law won't punish any murderers below the age of 18 I stepped out and was confused thinking what to do next? But I was hailed for murdering Big shots started inviting me for settling local disputes People whom I supported became a group... and made me famous so that they can show off. They even erected a cutout of mine Swag! Awesome! Superb! Anything sounds good Life was just awesome! Then came an offer A killing contract A huge ransom But I should be here to enjoy all that If I commit the murder, I'll go to prison for sure Because I was no longer 18 years old That's when an idea struck me To take guys below 18 years old under me and... I started this business Youngsters who hate their parents for punishing them... Youngsters who run away from home and survive in the streets as orphans Youngsters who hate the world because they can't express their love and failed in it I pay them more than they need I send them to bars and get them girls to spend that money That will jam their brain and thinking capacity My orders are all they obey And they follow it without any glitch Every cell in their brain... has my name, 'Padma' written all over it I make them understand that law doesn't punish murderers below 18 years, with my flashback That's when they step up and work without fear I am a henchman turned big shot drug dealer with the help of such youngsters I had only one guy under me when I started this business And now? I have youngsters working for me all over All the juvenile crimes that you read in the news... I am the mastermind behind it Once they're over 18 years I'll finish off the guys I don't need anymore This will upset you I was waiting to finish off your brother But then, you did it at the right time Well, let me tell you this... out of all guys under me, your brother was a masterpiece You know...the dogs... The street dogs, throw a piece of bone and they start biting and chewing it vigorously The bones hurt their teeth and they bleed But the dogs bite it more vigorously, thinking the blood is from the bone It doesn't realize it until it faints and dies These youngsters are just like that They can't afford one time meal but I have bought them Dragon chicken I touch their sentiments and they stay so loyal to me that... they live and die for me Enough of killing such youngsters, Padma Time's up for you Murugavel... you think I'll die if you shoot me? Of course, I will But I will continue to live through my boys All of them under me are exact photocopy of mine There are 1000s of Junior Padma's out there. Just like your brother Do you think you can shoot them all down? Will your law allow you to do so? Hence, be a responsible officer... have a taste of this and... leave! Meet me tomorrow and hand over the evidence to me Do you think I'll die if you shoot me? Of course, I will But I will continue to live through my boys All of them under me are exact photocopy of mine There are 1000s of junior Padma's in Tamil Nadu Do you think you can shoot them all down? Will your law allow you to do so? Try your best and just turn one youngster like me into a good person I promise I'll let you sleep peacefully My boys are a complete photocopy of me There are thousands of youngsters like me in Tamil Nadu Will you be able to shoot every one of them? Is it legal to do so? Our resignation letter Please sign What's your problem? Why are you all upset? Because I did not arrest Padma. Is it why? Will the problems be solved if we arrest or shoot him down? He has got more than hundred boys under his training How do I deal with them? Leading a thug life rocks... And with that idea 'Meesai' Padma has deceived all the youngsters Police are dummies, Rowdies rock We have to become like Padma, who his mom and the councilor fears He rocks! He is a swag! And any idea what we are supposed to be doing? Rowdies are dummies... Police rock! We will have to make them understand that We have to instill that idea in their minds And for that, we need to tarnish Padma's image He should be embarrassed... insulted... and be afraid Nobody should suffer like my brother. I will not let that happen Call up to this number - Hello - Murugavel sir wants to talk. Hold on - Who is it? - 'Meesai' Padma Sir... - Here... - Put it on speakers Just be careful on what you speak I have been waiting for you Everyone here thinks you are a swag and are afraid I am frustrated with this Because... I am an egoist To me... I don't like someone superior than me Really? If you satisfy my ego... You killed Kumar, right? I will destroy the video evidence in your presence Sir... I will not show it to anyone You can then be peaceful What do you say? What do you want me to do? You are a .. Hippie...Do you want me to announce that? Or...Do you need a special treatment? Oh no! That's too much to ask Just a small favor... I will meet you at home and tell you 'He is an arrogant fellow' Ouch! If you are this slow, a police like Murugavel would shoot you down easily Shoot him on the forehead Boss, Murugavel is on his way upstairs 'He is an arrogant fellow' Finish it 'Arrogance is his middle name' A cup of hot tea What's up, Murugavel? Before coming here... 'I am going to meet 'Meesai' Padma, if anything happens to me, he is responsible You would have given a statement at the police station No, Padma 'My stomach is upset... I have written saying 'I am going to the toilet' I heard... You are a little arrogant A little arrogant? Hey! You heard it wrong I am a lot arrogant If you are arrogant enough to train school students I have a team of 72 police officers at RB police station, I am a lot arrogant Okay. You are a lot arrogant I agree Now tell me what should I do? If I take action against you with the video proof of killing Kumar You will be held up dealing with court and the case for at least four months When you return home, you will have no one here Do you know why? Like you killed Kumar, they will be afraid to think if you will kill them too They will leave and start their own business Then, you will have to do business with your dad If you don't want this to happen What should I do? Very simple... Tie my shoe lace Do you know whom are you messing up with? If I tie your shoe lace... will your ego gets satisfied? Will you give me the video? Definitely... There shouldn't be any problem because of the video Padma... You are an accused... You may go back on your word I am a cop I keep up with my promise This video... will not get you in trouble I am afraid something might happen to you after I tie your lace Hey! Whatever it is, do it tomorrow Now, tie my shoe lace You asked for tea You tied his shoe lace... This disgusting thing is all over social media Even worse, it's got 5 lakhs likes Moreover, two guys under our control, are not picking calls since morning And the three guys who were here, are missing What will you do if all these guys under our control go away? Look...try to understand Only if the localities fear, foreigners will be afraid It seems Murugavel is happy over this That's it! Murugavel is going to have a peaceful sleep tonight He bothers us when his BP is 150 If it goes down normal to 120... Within 24 hours... I will prove him wrong Hopeless... - Can I see the Inspector? - He is inside The video was the only proof, you have burnt the pen-drive You let down my hope of saving my son from Padma Enough.... You broke all our trust Please don't be furious. Get in Please sit down Please sit down Water... Sir... This is your son This is Padma... Padma has taken over your son How? Telling him that Police are dummies and Rowdies rock He has deceived your son Let's consider this as police What am I going to do?

Please Sir, what do you mean? Am I here to listen to your tales? You throw stones and the water comes out...How silly! I thought you would save my son. You have let me down If they get to know that I gave you the pen-drive, his life will be at risk I will make sure that does not happen What will you do? I know that you too fear Padma Why don't you agree to it? I am not afraid of Padma I am not afraid of Padma I did not kill Padma fearing your son's life I want to wipe off my brother's sins I want to wipe off my brother's sins For you, it's only about your son There are thousands like him under Padma's control If your son changes, many will change.

This will change them I will prove them what police are capable of I will get these guys back This is my mom This is the only photo of hers I have got Not even a day goes by without seeing it Please take it The day when your son returns home safe, give it to me In case, if your son doesn't turn up Then throw it in the bin Sir... Murugavel.... You will be finished! You are an egoist and I am a sadist I will not kill you soon I will make sure you are stripped and get embarrassed Not bearing the torture You are going to beg me to kill you Let's see... Before you do that, I will break your limbs Make you beg on the streets and after you die, I'll place a memorial statue Next to the statue, an inscription that reads, 'Do not live a disgusting life' and I'll sign it If any one of this happens Any one... I'll clad a saree... Worse, I'll kneel before you Oh, Ok. I'll send you a saree Media, which he used as a tool to embarrass you, will have the news of his death Inspector, take a look at this Look, how the public is stoning on police officers These people deserve to be thrashed I have already watched the video People are furious over corrupt politicians So, they attack police officers So? Do you want us to get beaten up and be dead? I did not mean that Defeat yourself Sir, I was thrilled to see you giving orders to Padma I had goose bumps Police rock! We realized, being good makes us live with respect And so, we've left Padma Yes. Please take us as 'friends of police', it will be easy for us to become police To become 'friends of police', there are certain rules You should become a member at the police station Seek permission from the Inspector and become 'friends of police' First, you all should be fit. Ok? Let's do it - Pick up a stone - Ah! What? Go, get a stone Why is he asking us to pick stones? I don't know Brothers, each of you throw stones at me If any of the stones hit me, you will be friends of police When public throw stones at us, this is how we block and defend Sir, we understand. But don't get beaten up by these youngsters You are mocking at me? Dude, get a bigger stone You may get hurt. Move It is a crime to slit with a blade He is sure going to be stoned to death Forget it. At his own risk You too. Move Hey! He thinks we are going to throw it together Let's hit him at once I'll hit him on his chest I will, on his arms And head Hey!
