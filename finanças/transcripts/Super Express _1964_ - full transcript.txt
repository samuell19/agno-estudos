Oh, it's you? I'm Nakae from Tokyo. - Nakae-san? - Yes. I represent the Tozai Kaihatsu company from Ginza. My name's Kikyo. How can I help you? - Bring us some tea. - Yes. Actually... ... I'm going to buy a piece of land in this area. What price range are you interested in? Kikyo-san, I heard a large factory is going to be built here. - Do you know anything about it? - A factory? - Never heard about it. - Really? That's weird. I got this information from a reliable source. Who told you about it? And what kind of factory is it? Here. Well, what do you say? Do you want to make money with me? Your regular commission is 30-40 yen for 1 tsubo (≈3,3 sq.m.). And I'm paying at least 100 yen. Will you help me get this piece of land? Where is it? We can't talk privately here. Do you mind if we go to Okayama? - Okayama? - I'm driving. It'll take 20 minutes at the most. Let's go. - Welcome back. - Yes, it's me again. - Here you go. - Come in, Kikyo-san. Sister, can you excuse us? I'll call you when I need you. And shut the door. Alright. To our meeting. Cheers. So, coming back to our conversation... ... are you ready to do business with me? Tell me everything in detail. Are you sure that a large factory is going to be built here? No doubt about it. Daisaku Yamano-sensei personally told me. He can be trusted. Where is this factory going to be located? Right here. In Oto-Izumida-Kishine. - It's a really strange long stretch of land. - This factory... ... is going to produce cars together with Ford. - A car factory? - That's right Here's the project. There will be a production line. Cars will be produced one after another... ... that's why it has to be so long. I see. However, it includes the red lights district occupying around 200,000 tsubo (≈ 66 ha). How much are you ready to pay for 1 tsubo? And what's the market price? Local farmers are quite greedy. I think the price will be around 4 thousand per 1 tsubo. Four thousand multiplied by 200,000… That's 800 million. 800 million is a lot of money. You think I can't afford it? Leave it to me. You have nothing to worry about. I represent one of Japan's biggest banks - Mitsuboshi bank. 800 million is not a problem for us. So, are we doing this or not? And what is my part in this? You're going to negotiate with the land owners. If a stranger like me does it... ... famers might get suspicious... ... and increase the price. - That's true. - Exactly. Since you're a local, they will trust you more. So, are you going to talk to them? You'll make a few million in commission. I hope you want to make money, am I right? - Well... - Or you're out? "Keiichi Kikyo, 28, Niwase family, Okayama prefecture." "After graduating from the faculty of Economy of Kansai University..." "... got a job in a brokerage firm in Osaka." "In 1962 he resigned and started his own business, but didn't succeed." "The land that he had inherited was sold to pay off his debts." "Then he started «Kikyo Shoji», a trade company... " "... which he still runs today." Quite comprehensive. You've been in business your whole life. And you want to get a multi-million deal. This says a lot about you. Even I, president of a small company... ... dream about creating a chain of hotels and entertainment centers all over Japan. So, do you want to make this deal with me? You come from an old family, and locals know you. You're full of energy and drive to make money. You're the man we need. Right? Shall we do it? Alright. Let's do it. Great. Here's 100 thousand yen. It's your advance for transport expenses. Are we closing the deal? SUPER-EXPRESS AKA THE BLACK SUPER-EXPRESS Produced by Hiroaki Fujii Written by Yasuzô Masumura and Yoshio Shirasaka Based on the novel by Sueyuki Kajiyama Cinematography by Setsuo Kobayashi Art Direction by Tomoo Shimogawara Sound Effects by Kimio Tobita Lighting Effects by Nagaharu Watanabe Music by Tadashi Yamauchi Film Editing by Tatsuji Nakashizu Cast: Jirô Tamiya, Yukiko Fuji, Eiji Funakoshi, Daisuke Katô Jotaro Semba, Yasuo Harumoto, Tatsuya Ishiguro Yujo Hayakawa, Tatsuo Hanabu, Kiichiro Ueda Gakuya Morita, Eiichi Takamura, Keneji Oyama, Shizuo Tuzo Hiroko Machida, Sachiko Meguro, Fumiko Murata, Noriko Hodaka Jun Osanai, Saburo Sakai, Tsutomu Nakata, Tikara Hashimoto Aiko Mishima, Fukayo Matsumura, Michiko Masugi, Keiko Arishima Kan Takami, Koji Kosugi, Masaki Nando, Tetsuro Takeuchi Goro Kudan, Gen Harada, Rin Shugimori, Toshio Mori Directed by Yasuzô Masumura Already in Yokohama. This super-express is really fast. This is real luxury. Keiichi, is Nakae-san paying for the return tickets too? Of course. And what if I don't want to sell my land to Nakae-san? Even if he raises the price from 4 to 7 thousand? But 200 thuosand tsubo for 7 thousand per 1 tsubo is 1,400 million. How can he manage that? Don't worry about that. Nakae-san represents one of the three largest banks in the country. But according to your research... ... this man is listed as a National railways employee. Our brokers don't know anything about him. That information is outdated. He is now president of the Tozai Kaihatsu company. But that company's authorized capital is 6 million. Besides, import and tourism are struggling now. Why would a well-known bank engage the services of this man? We've been talking about it for three months. The final sale agreement should be signed tonight in Tokyo. It's too late to worry about it now. And what if you conspired with him to cheat us? If you're not paid, you won't give the land. Exactly. I trust Nakae-san. You're talking about his upbringing and career... ... as if we're some important people who are selling their family land. The land we're selling is useless. Nothing but stones. Even if I worked all year round... ... I could make 300-400 from one hectare. With the price of 7 thousand for 1 tsubo, I'll get 21 million yen for a hectare. If you put this money in the bank, you can earn 850 thousand a year in interest. So, thanks to Nakae-san, I can get twice as much without doing anything. We're approaching Tokyo. Come in. Nakae-san, I've just arrived. Good. I took the landowners to the restaurant. Good job. You've been working for four months. There have been many difficulties, but you made it. Kikyo-san, I'm really grateful to you. Thanks to you, this deal has been made possible. But they're getting stubborn again. Now they want 8 thousand instead of 7. Nonsense! They're not getting more. Those lousy rednecks are so greedy. Did you talk them into this? If you doubt me, then I don't need anything from you. I'm out. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Will you try to convince them? And I'll raise your commission to 120 yen for 1 tsubo. I'll try. By the way, are all the papers ready? - Yes, everything is ready. - Good. Then you can go to the restaurant too. No. - We'll go together. - What for? It's not safe to carry all that money by yourself. Don't worry, I'll go by car with my personal driver. So, go ahead. Madam? - Here you have. - Thank you. I'll see you tonight and tell you how it went. What a beautiful woman! Is she your friend? It's my friend's wife. Well, let's go. The signing is now finished. We're really grateful. Now I'm ready to give out the money. Since the sum is very big... ... we signed cheques for the Mitsuboshi bank. Please, make sure the sum corresponds to what the agreement says. Kata-san. Ofuji-san. Kobayashi-san. Here you go. Yoshino-san. Oyama-san. Saito-san. Ogawa-san. Kato-san. Yoshida-san. Shoji-san. Yano-san. Kawakami-san. Here you are. Namba-san. Miki-san. Suzuki-san. Kikyo-san, your commission will be paid in cash. There's a lot of fuss now, we'll do it later. Have you received all the agreed money for your land? I've never held 47 million in my hands before. Is this real money? Do you guarantee that I'll get money when I return to my town? It's more reliable than money. Your land is very important for me. Please, accept my sincere gratitude. On top of that... ... we also paid for you to stay in a wonderful hotel for three days. You can go to a night club in Tokyo tower... ... and see other sights in the city. Kikyo-kun will take you there. Have a good time. Kikyo-kun, let geishas bring saké and food. Kikyo-san, something terrible has happened. The share price has dropped from 76 to 25 yen. It's a 51 yen decrease. Damn, sell immediately. Even if we sell now... ... we'll lose 25 million yen from 1 million shares. It's everything you have on your deposit. Broke again... A large factory is being built, the share price is growing and the very moment I buy shares... ... the facotry blows up. What a coincidence! Kikyo-san, it was a gamble all along. It makes no sense to spend three times the amount of deposit on a purchase. Leave me alone. I need a large sum of money as soon as possible. Don't hurry. It's the second large loss. What happens twice, will happen again. You shouldn't gamble on stocks anymore. No, I'll try again. Anyway, you don't have the capital for it. You've already sold the land you inherited. I'll find the money. Alright. But it's better for you to return to Okayama and earn as a real estate agent. It's none of your business. Welcome back. Keiichi, where did you go? - To Osaka. - To the stock exchange again? Did you make any money? If you have money, lend me some. Have you come here to borrow money? Kobayashi-san, thanks to me you sold a useless land for 32 million. Could you lend me 1 or 2 million? I don't have that kind of money. How's that possible? It's been less than six months. I spent all of it. We built a new house, bought a car for our children... ... and there's nothing left now. Well, less than 100 thousand. I heard your woman from the Okayama cabaret is planning to open her own bar? That's why I'm here. It's impossible. The share price has dropped, and now I'm broke. Stop lying. You earned a lot from this deal with Nakae. It's impossible to lose all that money on stock exchange. It was 120 yen for 1 tsubo. In total, 24 million yen. All it took was one small failure, and all the money was gone. Your commission was too low. It's the Shinkansen, after all. The Shinkansen? What are you talking about? Don't pretend you don't know. The land we sold will be used for the high-speed railway system. To be exact, for the second line between Osaka and Fukuoka. They cheated us really well, didn't they? The Shinkansen line? Nakae and you tried to convince us that there would be a factory. You come from a known family, so we believed you. We shouldn't have. We sold our land for 7 thousand per tsubo. Do you know how much the Shinkansen got for this land? I don't. The price was 45 thousand yen when it was sold to the Department of Land. So 38 thousand multiplied by 50 thousand tsubo equals 1.9 billion of profit. You cheated us really well. Is that true? Don't pretend you didn't know. Last night I had a guest from the Department of Land... ... and he complained a lot about Nakae. We, the landowners, also have a grudge against him. And you should watch out around here. I see... Damn. So that's how it was. Nakae must have paid you more. At least 30 or 50 million. Please, lend me at least one million from that money. I have to pay off a debt as soon as possible... ... otherwise I'll lose my house. Please! I'm going to Tokyo soon, and the office will be closed. You can take a leave too. Keiichi! Tell your director that Kikyo wants to talk to him. You lost on stock exchange and want to borrow 5 million? What happened to the Kikyo-san I knew? Actually, I'd like to get 10 million. You must be kidding. We paid your commission in full. We don't owe you anything. I understand that. However... ... selling the land in Okayama to the Shinkansen... ... brought you 1.9 billion. Even if you subtract the 1.4 billion in costs, that still leaves 500 million. But even that's not all. I found out that you did the same in Shimonoseki and that's another 300 million. Your total profit was about 800 million yen. That's why it would be fair... ... if you shared 5 or 10 more million with me. That deal... ... was the result of a lucky coincidence. So I don't have to share... ... any extra profit with you. A lucky coincidence? Are you serious? You found out about these plans from the Constitution Party. I was told about Toyo's project for a factory. They were going to start construction in that area. I don't believe a thing you say. If you don't, you can go to Toyo and ask there. You're lying. Someone told you about the Shinkansen's plans... ... and you bought that land before them. Kikyo-san, are you threatening me? If I go to the police... ... everyone will know what you did. You're a fool. You can go anywhere you want. You have no proof. No one will take you seriously. No proof? I don't even have to try hard to get plenty of evidence. Your reputation might suffer if you don't take this seriously. Would you really prefer to have an enemy like me rather than pay 5 million? Think about the advantages. I'm not the kind of person that can be threatened. Go away. Fine, I'll leave. But you'll regret it. I'll hit you where it hurts. You'll be sorry. You won't do it. Because then you'll find yourself behind bars for blackmail. Get out of here. You're the one who'll be behind bars. I'm staying in Kanda, in a cheap hotel called Nishiki. If you change your mind, come any time. Follow the car that the woman gets in. TAMARU FAMILY I'm home. I'd like to speak to Tamaru-san. - With who exactly? - Is the man of the house in? There isn't one. There is only the lady and her daughter. And what does the lady do? Unfortunately, she's sick. She's been bed-ridden for two years. Bed-ridden? She's old and in weak health. I'm looking for an attractive woman, about 24-25 years old. So, you must be looking for the daughter, Yoko-san? Daughter? I'd like to talk about Yoko-san from the Tamaru family. Probably about marriage again? It's no use. Why not? She declines all the marriage proposals. Pretty young women get too ambitious... ... when they graduate from university. She's almost 26. She should get married soon... ... so that her sick mother can see her grandchild. Even if a woman has a job, she still needs a husband. And what does she do? - She works for the Shinkansen. - Shinkansen? She's the director's secretary and earns a lot. I see. Of course. SHINKANSEN CORPORATION WESTERN JAPAN BRANCH I'd like to talk to the director's secretary, Yoko Tamaru. Yoko Tamaru? - We don't have anyone with that name. - You don't? That's impossible. If you don't believe me, you can check with the HR department. Tamaru Yoko-san? I was told she works here. She's not on the staff list. Oh, Tamaru-kun! I knew her. - She quit two years ago. - Quit? Resigned. And who's that? That's the executive director himself. What's his name? Masayoshi Zaitsu. A wonderful man. Kikyo-san, you have a visitor. A visitor? Also, I'd like you to pay for your stay. It's been three days. Of course. So, it's you. - Here, take this. - What is it? - The money. - How much? One million. I was wrong yesterday. Five million is too much. I think this should be enough. I hope you're satisfied now. No way. Now I won't accept, neither 5 nor 10 million. Why not? I'm getting a better picture of the kind of person you are. Nakae-san. You got your information directly from the Shinkansen, didn't you? - What are you saying? - Isn't that right, though? I'll nail you, rest assured. You're a fool. Give up your ridiculous ideas. Take the money and go back to Okayama. If you want me to leave... ... bring me 50 million instead. Then, I'll return to Okayama. Mother, I'm off. - Good morning. - Morning. MORI APARTMENTS Excuse me. Which flat is Yoko Tamaru's? Tamaru-san? We don't have anyone with that name. That's weird. I was told she lives here. Please, leave. Done. Sorry you had to wait. - Tell me! - Yes? Do you deliver food to those apartments? Very often. There's a woman there, about 25-26 years old, with beautiful eyes and a birth mark. That's Mr Naganuma's wife. But everyone says she's his lover. Naganuma? She sometimes orders delivery, but more often comes here with her husband. They always order expensive dishes with shellfish. They're good customers. Is that man 50-ish and speaks with an Osaka accent? No, he's about 40. Very well-groomed. He looks like a president of a big company. And he often comes to the apartments? Seems like it. They come to our place often too. Speak of the devil! Here she comes. That's her alright. Two steaks, please. - As usual? - Yes. You're the only one in this neighborhood... ... who orders steak a few times a week. Your husband must really like meat. Today's performance in the opera house was wonderful! Kikyo-san, when are you going to pay for your stay? I'll pay tomorrow, don't worry. If you don't, I'll kick you out. Alright. Who is it? Urgent message from Nakae-san. Come in. Great apartment. It must have cost around 6 million. - Who bought it for you? - What is it? What did Nakae-san want? Did Nakae-san buy it? Or was it Zaitsu-san? Who are you? Keiichi Kikyo, a real estate agent from Okayama. So, you lied about having a message from Nakae-san? Leave. Get out now! That's exactly what I expected to hear. But I'm not going to leave so easily. I'm calling the police. Tamaru-san, do you want your sick mother... ... to learn about it from the neighbors? About how her daughter doesn't work in the Shinkansen corporation. About how she quit two years ago. About how she goes to the Mori apartments every day. And that she's not a secretary... ... but a prostitute. That she goes to the greengrocer's and to the butcher's. And sometimes eats suishi with her man... ... or goes for a walk with him. So what? Your man is the Shinkansen's executive director, Masayoshi Zaitsu. Should I continue? Do you make love in this luxurious bed? Enough. What do you want from me? I have a few questions. If you answer them, I'll keep your secret. What questions? What's the connection between Zaitsu and Nakae? I don't know. Has Nakae discussed about Shinkansen with Zaitsu here? I don't know. Sometimes you came to Nakae in the Grand Hotel... ... and brought him brown envelopes with cheques. Who were they from? I don't remember. I see. I'm not leaving, then. Can you get me 100 thousand yen? I don't have that kind of money. And you're living like this? Don't lie to me. I said I don't have it. This bed is really comfortable. I envy Zaitsu. How about we have fun together? If you agree, I'll leave. Fine, but only on one condition. You'll never come here again. Promise that you won't blackmail me. I promise. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. People like you surprise me. You slept with a stranger that you've never seen before. I don't want to upset my sick mother. That's all. But you didn't want to pay 100 thousand yen for that. You promised you'd leave. So you want money more than anything. Have you saved a lot by sleeping with me? Nakae... ... must have learnt from Zaitsu about plans to build the Shinkansen line. If the police finds out, he'll be arrested for corruption. You know very well about the relationship between Zaitsu and Nakae. And you're going to tell me everything. I'll threaten them. I'll say, "If you don't pay, I'll tell the police". I'm going to blackmail them. You don't know how much longer he's going to support you. And using blackmail, we can get much more out of them. If you really want money, joining me will be much smarter. Enough talking. Leave. If you change your mind, come to me. I'm staying in Kanda, in a hotel called Nishiki. Come and tell me everything about Nakae and Zaitsu. For your own sake. I'm grateful that you have agreed to come despite being so busy. It's better for me not to show up in your office. - Do you have some urgent business? - Yes. I feel embarrassed to ask you this... ... but could you break up with Yoko Tamaru? Why? A real estate agent named Kikyo has arrived from Okayama. He's trying to kick up fuss... ... and sticks his nose everywhere. If you break up with that woman and sell the apartment... ... there will be no way to find a connection between us. It would be a great relief. But I can't break up with her right now. Why not? Zaitsu-san, you should know... ... that you have to be careful with women. Any mistake might cost you your life. I know that you really like her... ... but if you do break up with her... ... I'll find you someone younger. - I have to think about it. - Please do. But it's in our common interests that you do it as soon as possible. Things might escalate. This Kikyo can be a threat. So he's not going to come here anymore? We have to sell it immediately. But that wasn't what we agreed on. This apartment belongs to me. I'll find you another one. But from now on, you have to break up with Zaitsu-san. - Why? - You should understand that yourself. The deal is done, and you have to break up now. But Zaitsu-san didn't even talk to me. That's improper. - I love him, after all. - Love? Don't be ridiculous. All you need from him is his money. But you can't keep receiving it forever. He's going to leave you, anyway. Fine. Then, I want to get a compensation. A compensation? Who said you're entitled to one? You better pay up. I know a lot. Are you trying to blackmail me? - Call it whatever you like. - And how much do you want? - Ten million yen. - What? I want to buy a cafe in Shibuya for 20 million. You fool! You're not getting anything. You cashed in on that land deal. I did a lot of work for you. I see that I spoiled you. In any case, until you buy me a new flat, I'm not going anywhere. You'll regret this. Kikyo-san! Is it about money again? I pawned my watch yesterday to pay you. - You have a visitor. - A visitor? A young woman. I think her name's Tamaru-san. - She came. - Should I bring her here? To this dirty room? No, I'll go to her myself. This is a love hotel. Exactly. No one comes here during the day. No one can hear us here. So, you came. Do you want to make money together? That's right. Nakae turned out to be greedy. And so, you came to me? You like sly and unscrupulous women. I love you. When this is done, I'm going to leave you. I see. Then tell me about Nakae and Zaitsu. You're going to blackmail Nakae. What's my share? How much do you want? A half. Deal. Alright. I first met Nakae 3 years ago. I was working as a secretary in the Shinkansen at the time. I often visited Zaitsu-san's house. His wife has TB and has been bed-ridden for a long time. Zaitsu-san is interested in ancient pottery. That's how he met Nakae. One day he showed up with a recommendation letter from a member of the Constitution Party... ... and they immediately got on. I don't have a fever today. I feel so good. My hands are so cold. Touch them. Yes, I'm very glad. - Sir... - What? - Nakae-san wants to see you. - What is it about? He brought a rare jar from the Joseon dynasty. He wants you to see it. It's very good. I'd like to buy it. How much is it? If you like it, you can keep it. I don't feel good about it. I can't get presents from you so often. Don't worry, I don't have any secret intentions. Tamaru-san, you work so hard. I'd like to thank you for your dedication. Are you free tonight? - Let's go somewhere. - Alright. Let's go, then. There's a place in Yotsuya which serves very good fish. But I'm afraid. You think I want to seduce you? I'm not so arrogant. You can trust me. KATSURAGI Would you like a drink? For me too. This is my wife. So, feel free to eat and drink anything you want. I owe everything to my husband. Nice to meet you. So, Yoko-san. I'm a simple man. Let's talk directly. You need money, don't you? Here. This is a small report by a private detective. "Yoko Tamaru, 23 years old..." "Born in 1937. Elder daughter of school teacher Kenjiro Tamaru." "At the age of 11, lost her father in a train accident." "Was brought up by her mother, who worked as a maid." "When she turned 18, her mother became bed-ridden." "From then on, she started working in a bar while attending high school." "In university, she had an affair with her teacher." "But he later left her because he had wife and children." "In 1959, at the age of 22, she got a job in the Shinkansen." Is that right? You're well-informed. Currently "isn't looking to get married." "Wants to open and run her own accessories store in Ginza." That's what you said to your friend. Is that true? Yes. In that case, I have a job for 10 million. What do you say? Are you interested? What kind of job? You need to become someone's second wife for a year. It's not just being a lover. You'll have an apartment worth 6 million at your disposal. And you'll also receive a 500-thousand monthly allowance. What do you say? And who is the man? Zaitsu-san. The director? That's right. Zaitsu-san is an important man. He can't tell it to you himself. But he's in love with you. If you just look at him, you'll see it. It's very serious. His wife is very sick. Next to a pretty girl like you, he'll feel younger himself. With your salary of 25 thousand a month... ... how many years will you need to fulfil your dream? Plus you need money for your mother's treatment. If you do this, you'll have your store in a year. Will I get money and an apartment for sure? Yes. Rest assured. So, I agreed to it. It took a couple of months to seduce Zaitsu-san. Eventually, he invited me to a hotel. Did you love him at least a bit? Not at all. You slept with him for money? Well, yes. I've been poor since I was little. I've always been short of money. Isn't it better to marry a rich man instead of doing this? Not all men are reliable. Getting involved with the teacher who had wife and kids was a mistake. I don't want to depend on men anymore. I want to be my own person. And what happened next? How often can we see each other? I don't know. I knew that we'd break up after tonight. It's so hard to part. I owe your wife an apology. No. I'll never break up with you. Director, do you love me? Yes. This is the first time I've fallen in love. - Then, I have a request to you. - What request? This hotel is so uncomfortable. Maybe you could find an apartment, at least for a month. Let's live together and enjoy each other to the fullest. You're right. I thought about that myself. I'd like to be with you all the time. There's a nice apartment. I can tap into my savings and rent it. Will you come over from time to time? I've been dreaming about this life for many years. I wish it would never end. Does it mean you want it too? Are you okay with being my secret lover for all your life? I'm not an old maiden who dreams of getting married. All I want is to love and be loved, like now. We came to the apartment in Akasaka that Nakae bought every day. Zaitsu-san liked playing this couple game. Every month, I received 100 thousand from Zaitsu-san... ... and Nakae paid me 500 thousand. And what happened between you and Nakae after that? A time came when he started blackmailing us. Director, I thought you were an honest man. - I'm surprised. - What are you talking about? I'm talking about your charming secretary. Are you hiding her in your apartment in Akasaka? I was there last night. And I saw you walking with a pretty young woman. I had someone carry out an investigation for me. A vase is just a vessel... ...but I see you prefer living vessels? Have you told anyone about this? I understand. Your wife is the only daughter of Kohei Kudo, the Constitution Party's leader. If he finds out, he'll be very upset. It's better if he doesn't. - Please, don't tell him. - For this... ... I'll ask a favor of you. - What favor? - This is a very unpleasant story. People might start talking about your visits to that apartment. Someone might recognize you while you're there. Or you might be seen together in a restaurant. I'm not asking for much. I need the project for the second line of the Shinkansen. Shinkansen? I want to know where exactly in Okayama the line will be. I'd be grateful if you told me. And what are you going to do with this information? I'm going to buy the land where that line will be built. Are you trying to involve me in corruption? Well, that's correct. You giving me this information will be our secret. No one will know about the deal. Even if it comes out... ... no one will be able to find any connection between you and me. The police won't have anything on you either, so don't worry. The profit from selling the land is going to be split between the two of us. So, are you going to tell me or not? No way. That's a mistake. "The Shinkansen's executive director... ... spends time in his secretary's apartment." I can only imagine how upset your father-in-law is going to be. And he's an important man. It's going to be a scandal. I see. Nakae is an unscrupulous man. He learnt where the Shinkansen line was going to be, but he didn't have the money to buy the land. So, he started blackmailing Kohei Kudo, Zaitsu's faither-in-law. Kudo-sensei! I already received the information I needed from Zaitsu-san. But I have a favor to ask of you too. Could you ask Mitsuboshi bank in Yokohama... ... to lend me 2 billion? I don't have anything to do with the Mitsuboshi bank. Pardon me for saying this, but... The president of this bank and you were roommates... ... and groupmates in Kyoto University. You're close friends. You're like brothers. If you ask... ... to lend me just 2 billion... What if I say no? That's not an option. In that case, the fact that Zaitsu-san shared information... ... about the construction of the Shinkansen will be made public. Besides, there's also his affrair with his secretary. Newspapers will be delighted. What do I care? Your poor son-in-law... ... will lose his position in society. Your daughter will be miserable. Your own reputation and political career will suffer. Are you threatening me? Not at all... I'm just a stray dog. Why would I pick fights with you, Sir? Thanks to me, you're going to cash in. I deserve a half. The profit is 800 million. Kudo got 400 million, Zaitsu and Nakae 200 million each. And what did you get? Apartment and monthly allowance. Less than 10 million in total. Nakae gave you 10 million and got 200. And Kudo... ... got 400 million for one talk with the bank. So, it wasn't only Nakae who committed fraud. Both Kudo and Zaitsu were involved too. If you help me, we might have a chance. Are you ready? What do I have to do? Your words aren't enough to blackmail them. - We need evidence. - What evidence? Leave it to me. You're still using that apartment in Akasaka. You're still in touch with Nakae and Zaitsu. Nakae told me... ... not to show up there anymore. Does he know about us? Not yet. We have to act quickly. I need money. Lend me 500 thousand. When we get our money, I'll pay you back twice the amount. I feel terrible. Why? Because Nakae-san told us to break up. Do you want to break up with me? No. But it's for your own sake... Not at all. Let's take a photo together. So, we have something left to remind us. After we break up... ... I don't want to forget the happiness I experienced here. What do you say? - Fine. - Great. Can we do it with this lighting? Yes, you just need high exposure. Smile. I don't want you to look sad. - Let me see the camera. - You've seen it before. When I was a student, I used to be interested in photography and collect cameras. Can I see it? Alright. Zaitsu-san, what are you doing? Why have you brought a camera here? What are you going to photograph? You want us to break up. And we decided to take a photo together. Whose idea was it? - Yoko-san's? - Yes. - I'm taking this camera. - What for? Zaitsu-san, you're an important man. What were you thinking taking photos like that? That woman can blackmail you with them. You have to be careful. Yoko will blackmail me? No way! She's a dangerous woman. She's not who you think she is. Until now, she pretended to be meek... ... but now she's changed her tune. That woman isn't dreaming about being your lover. She wants money. I used her to blackmail you. She's ready to play any part for money. Are you mad at me? You can be mad all you want. But you have to break up with her right now. Yoko, is this true? I'm sorry. Forgive me. It was like that in the beginning, but now it's different. I really love you. Nonsense. I don't need you anymore. Don't even come near Zaitsu-san. Director, this man cheated and blackmailed you. Don't listen to him. Believe me. Please, hear me out. You don't believe me? Fine. All I'm asking is one more night. Then, I'll leave. Are we really going to forget everything we had? Enough! Do you know a man named Kikyo? I don't. If I find out that you teamed up with him to blackmail me... ... I'll take revenge! Remember that! Yoko, you're not going to catch me off-guard anymore! Director! Hey! Enough of this drama! I'll find you another apartment. Don't come here anymore. Got it? It's me again. I wanted to ask you something. What is it? Has a young woman ever come to Kikyo-san? - No, never. - Has she ever called him on the phone? I never seen such a woman. Are you sure? Well... some woman named Tamaru came. And she called today too. I see. But Kikyo-san forbid me to talk about it. I won't tell anyone. Thank you. So, it didn't work out with the photo. If Nakae hadn't shown up, it would have worked. Alright. Next time, we'll use a voice recorder. - What voice recorder? - This one. You have to hide it in the apartment... ... and make Zaitsu tell you everything. Especially that part about Nakae and the Shinkansen. If the connection between Zaitsu and Nakae becomes clear... ... it will be proof that a case of corruption took place. If we then take it to the police department... ... detectives there will be thrilled. - But we can't do it. - Why not? Zaitsu-san isn't going to come to that apartment anymore. Nakae told him everything. Damn it. I was sure this would work. Zaitsu, I didn't expect such carelessness from you. You let yourself be tricked by a woman and blackmailed. Nakae-kun, where did you find that bitch? She betrayed us and teamed up with Kikyo. What are we going to do now? I'm sorry. By luring Yoko away from us... ... Kikyo got an ace. I don't have any ideas. Should we pay him to keep his mouth shut? That's not going to work. He'll try to blackmail us again. What do we do, then? The woman is the real problem. She has to disappear. That's true. It's easier to get it done with a woman. We have to eliminate Yoko. Eliminate? You shut up! Is she going to come tonight? No. It's too dangerous. Zaitsu, you have to tell her to come. It has to be done tonight. But carefully. What has to be done? You know that yourself. Do it yourself. If you hire someone, they will blackmail you. But how? If I threaten her, she'll run away. It's no use threatening this woman. True. I'm ready to commit any crime... ... for money. But murder... We're talking about a lot of money here. Nakae-kun, you have to do it in a smart way. Think it through. Now, you're a boss of a small company. If it works out, you'll run a big company. Yes. And make up a good alibi for yourself. Then, Kikyo isn't going to hurt us anymore. Invite him to the Yotsuya restaurant. I'll arrange everything. What is it about? Have you given up? Yes. You're a tough nut to crack. Fifty million to get rid of you isn't that much, after all. But you're a bit late. I have some more material now. So, the sum has increased. - 50 million isn't enough anymore. - How much do you want? Well... 100 million. Alright. Let's discuss it over a drink. Come to the Yotsuya restaurant at 6. You're putting up a good front. I hope this isn't a trap. - Nonsense. - Your traps aren't going to help you. If something happens to me, the police will know. I have no intention of setting a trap for you. Relax. Thank you. Do you have a day off today? It's unusual to see you at home. I'm a bit under the weather. Hello. It's me, Zaitsu. Come to our apartment tonight. You asked me for one last date. So, we're going to spend this night together. I still love you. Please, come. Zaitsu, she's just a woman. There are many others. One lives, another dies. It doesn't matter. You have to succeed me and become a big politician. Zaitsu-san invited me. It must be a trap. He changed his mind too quickly. What if it's not? It's a chance to record everything. You have to go. Nakae seems to have given in. But I'm scared. You won't get any evidence without taking this risk. And without the evidence, we won't get any money. I want money. Look at Tokyo. New skyscrapers are rising one after another. Roads are going off in all directions. The entertainment industry is booming. But who runs this world? Who gets all the benefits? Large corporations are the new daimyō. And we're the poor peasants. Having a monthly salary is good... ... but a clerk is a bug, who rummages in dirt all his life. I hate that kind of life. I want to get some money and set up my own company. Please, go there. Alright, I will. You will? I will. I want money too. Don't worry. I'll come there myself later. I need one important piece of evidence too. What do you want? You will slip sleeping pills in his drink. When he falls asleep, you will undress him and lie next to him. And I will take a photo. Do I have to be naked? Yes. A voice recording isn't enough. A photo is much better. Make a copy of the key and give it to me. KATSURAGI Nakae-san is late. It's already 7. He just called and said he's coming. Here you have. - I'm leaving. - Wait. If you leave, I'll be in trouble. Nakae ordered you to keep me here. It was stupid of me to wait for him for so long. Don't say that. Are you Kikyo-san? You bastard! Take that! Hey! You dumbass... ... if you value your life, get out of here right now. We're from the Yamamoto gang. Remember us! Don't cross our path anymore. Got it? Who is it? It's Nakae. I'm here on Zaitsu-san's request. Open the door. Zaitsu-san had some urgent business. He's going to arrive in Tokyo soon. He said you will spend your last night in the Hama hotel. Get ready, I'll take you there. That's a lie. I'm not lying. You wanted to have this last night with Zaitsu-san yourself. Let's go! No. I'm staying here. Why? I don't want to go anywhere. I see. Suit yourself. Did you meet with a man named Kikyo? I said I don't know him. Don't lie. You came to his hotel room and called him on the phone. Why did you meet with him? Did the two of you agree to blackmail us behind our back? I can see it in your eyes, bitch. - We learnt it from you. - What did you say? You blackmailed Zaitsu-san... ... and got him to tell you about the construction of the Shinkansen. All for money. You will do anything for money. You're the one who blackmails people. So don't accuse us. Look at that, two suckers are trying to blackmail me. Do you want to kill me? Exactly. If you die, it will be much easier for us. It's pointless to kill me. Kikyo-san knows everything. So what? If you die, there will be no evidence. No one will believe him. - There is evidence. - Like what? Kikyo-san has it, and he will bring it here. - Do you want to buy it? - Stupid bitch. That sucker is dead by now. I thought you were smarter. You could get 10 million... ... and open your own store in Ginza. You could have anything you wanted. - Murderer! You villain! - You can scream all you want. No one will hear you. The walls in this apartment are sound-proof. A bitch like you deserves to die. A woman blinded by greed is a monster. Go to hell! Murderer! Help! Shut up! It's time to die! Bitch! It wasn't easy. A voice recorder? What a stupid toy. They're like children. To Akasaka! Hey! Hold on! Hello! Kikyo-san? I'm sorry for yesterday. I didn't keep my word. Why didn't you come to the restaurant? I changed my mind. Then again, if there's no evidence, there can be no blackmail. So, there's no need to pay. I have evidence. It's a tape. Tape? What tape? From a voice recorder. It's a 30-minute conversation between Zaitsu and you about the Shinkansen. Do you want to buy it? Fool! You're bluffing. I'm not, actually. Yoko made it. She's very smart. Hey! Stop with the nonsense. If you don't buy it, I'll take it to the police. If you're interested, come to Yoko's apartment in Mori... ... tonight at 8 o'clock. Did you get that? You look hurt. What happened to you? Stop pretending. You know what happened very well. Where's the tape? Here it is. How much are you paying? Can I hear it? Of course. - Murderer! - You can scream all you want. Want to hear more? It's pretty clear that it's Yoko and you. In order to get this piece of evidence, we used two voice recorders. One was among the flowers and the other in a book. We were afraid you would find one of them. So, what are you going to do? You didn't expect me to have evidence to put you away for murder, did you? It's a present for you from Yoko-san. Are you buying or not? How much? I'm paying 100 million, like you wanted. Are you serious? If I take this to the police... ... you'll be facing murder, not corruption charges. And that's capital punishment. Everything you have isn't enough to pay for this tape. How much do you want? 200 million. Everything you got from your Shinkansen fraud. Very well. It's a deal. But on one condition. Which one? Tell me what you did with Yoko-san's body. If you tell me, I'll sell the tape. I took it to the Tokyo Bay in my car. I tied a rock to it and drowned it. I see. Hey! Nakae! I'm not selling you the tape. I'm not selling it to a bastard that killed her like that. I thought you wanted your 200 million. Yes, I did. But when I heard this voice, everything changed. I didn't think that my love of money would get someone killed. The money that I was going to get from you... ... I promised to split with Yoko. I can't take it all. But Yoko was killed. A dead person has no use for money. Someone who died trying to get evidence... ... has no use for anything. It must have hurt to die... Kikyo-san, if money is what you really want... ... then I'm surprised to hear that from you. Why? Someone who makes money has to be ruthless. Do you think so? Is that how you think? I know it. Listen to this voice again, then. - Murderer! Help! - Shut up! And now? Don't you care? What's all this for? I see. - Do you enjoy it? - Help! Shut up! It's time to die! Bitch! Bastard! You bastard! How does it feel? Want some more? Do you understand how Yoko felt now? How did you murder Yoko? Like this? I'll kill you too. I want to kill you. And revenge Yoko's death. But I don't need to. You're going to be executed anyways. You're facing prison, cuffs and hanging. Hey, Detective! Come in. Everything was like he said. Here's the recording. Kikyo-san, could you identify the victim? It's her, no mistake. Kikyo-san, thanks to you... ... both Kudo and Zaitsu... ... have now been arrested for fraud. This evidence of corruption is so overwhelming... ... that they won't get away this time. Thank you. All I wanted was money. Nothing else. But they killed this woman for it. Do you confess the corruption case with the Shinkansen? If you tell us everything, it will be taken into account in your murder case verdict. Detective, I'll tell you everything. Just don't sentence me to death. We'll take it into consideration in your final sentence. Is that so? There's nothing more important than life. I will live. I'm so lucky. I will confess. Right away. MURDER IN APARTMENT Look, it's the Shinkansen! It's so fast! It's really incredible! THE END
