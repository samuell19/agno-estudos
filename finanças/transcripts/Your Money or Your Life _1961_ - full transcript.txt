You know well it was short. Get lost. It was 5,000 short. You cheated me. We had agreed on 15, you gave me 10. Mister, I need that money. My life depends on it. Hey, Mister, what are you doing? - Can't you be more careful? - No. Are you crazy?! Empty. Stop it! Mister, my life...! I'm a man of principles but now it's war, etc. If there was a round-up or something, I wouldn't hesitate to save your life... Same with the money: you need it for something, but so do I. You should be happy I gave you 10. Things were different before the war. Now... watch out. There are two uniforms by the exit. I'm going, and you better stay put. Or else I'll call 'em and tell 'em you're a Jew. - But I'm not a Jew... - I know, but before they clear things up you'll be blue in the face. Firm ground! Calm, calm... Have mercy, don't do this. I am a Jew. Bloody hell... Punch me in the face and run Go on, punch me! SUBTITLES: aileverte
