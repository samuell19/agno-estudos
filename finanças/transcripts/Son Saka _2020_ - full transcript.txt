My name is Serdar Gokalp. I've been a radio host all my life. I've hosted over 2000 episodes. I've been live on air hundreds of times. I've met thousands of people whom I've never seen. I'm mostly known for my prank calls. A lot of people enjoyed them of course. But how many people were hurt by my pranks? That I don't know. I wish I did. I wish I had known what a single prank could cost you. "Two Weeks Earlier" -Here's your dossier. -Thank you for all your help. -Have a nice day. -You too. Have a nice day. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Sir? -Have a good evening. -You too. -This spot is reserved for our truck. -The garbage truck? To take Yusuf? I'm kidding. I'll be inside, call me if it arrives. I'll be back in 10. I forgot to get the flowers. Here you go. My man... -What's with the flowers? -To eat, you know. Freshly picked. -Bro! -Welcome, how are you? -Thanks. How do I look? -You look great. Isn't that Serdar? Are those flowers? Hello there. What's the date today? I think I have a loan payment. That is long overdue, Sir. I'm talking about the second instalment. Get back to work! -Serdar, we're at work! -He's the one talking. You shut up too! How's it going? -Good, you? -Good, but you forgot. June 17th. What time is it? 17:06. Happy birthday, Aysen! Serdar, I'm at work. Don't embarrass me in front of everyone. Why would you be embarrassed? I already paid the first instalment. You know I don't mean that, Serdar. And this is it? June 17th, 17:06. You are so hard to please. I remembered the date. The time was just a little joke. Everyone, come here. The chump is blossoming. Stop it, Serdar. A big round of applause for the flowers! Bravo! Nobody move! Nobody! -Hands up! -Don't move! -Hands up! -Okay! Okay! Serdar... Sir, be careful with my head, I have migraine. Get your hands up. -What's going on here? -It's her birthday. It's men like you who spoil these sluts! Watch your mouth! -It's because you said "slut". -Oh, sorry. -What did you say? -Sorry! Sorry! It wasn't intentional, I swear! It's because you said "slut". -Where are the keys? -What keys? Where are the keys? -Okay! The keys... -Get the keys. -Tell them. -Open the drawer. Just tell them. Get the keys. -Let's go. -Serdar! -Take me to the safe. -Sir, we don't have a safe here. Like you didn't have the keys? Take me to the safe. I said it was at the back! -Okay, okay! -Here. Take these. -Go! Open the door! -Okay, okay. -Open the door! -Okay, I am! Go, go, go! -Open it! -Okay, I am. -1706! Open it! -Sir, the other key... -The customer has the other key. -Open the box. Here. -Open the damn thing! -Okay! I'm scared! I can't help it, my hands are shaking! Come on. -Take that, take it. -This? Yes. Open it. Will you marry me, Aysen? Oh! She fainted. I told you that this would knock her off her feet! I told you! Stop congratulating yourself and go get some cologne. -Get some cologne. -Aysen! Aysen, wake up. Mr. Serdar, you'll play our song on the radio, right? I promised my wife. Please, not now. She's unconscious. We'll talk about that later. Aysen? -Hello? -Hello. -Huh? -What do you mean "huh"? -Who answers the phone with "huh"? -Yes? -Hello? -Hello? -You showed my fiancée an apartment. -Yes? She paid you a deposit for it. But you still haven't rented her the place, and you refuse to return the deposit. A white car, just like yours. No licence plate. It hit another car in Kurtkoy... ...before being involved in a robbery just a couple blocks away. They robbed a store and killed the owner. -What do you do for a living? -Excuse me? What's your job? And stop excusing yourself. You have me repeating every question. -What do you do for a living? -No, Sir. Why would I kill someone? -Don't "sir" me! -What did you say, pal? Call me "pal" one more time, you'll see what happens. -The thing is... -Stop beating around the bush! You take the money, but you don't give the house! -Let me explain... -There's nothing to explain! How can you explain taking the money and not giving the house? Let me talk. There's nothing you can say. And stop stuttering! You saw the girl, you thought "easy money", right? Where do you live? Who do you think you are? -We have an office, Sir. -Oh, I'm a "sir" now? Wait a minute, hang on. Derya said all of that? Yes, miss, she used the exact same words. That slut. I knew she was the devil. It serves her right! I was the one who stole that file she "lost". To win our manager's favour. That idiot doesn't have a clue! She does now. Have a good day. "The Last Prank" Nice! Go! Go! Come on, Serdar! Go! Go! Goal! Where's the defence? Where is it? Chief, come on now. You could have saved that. Look who's talking! One shoulder bump, and you're down. Just stand in the middle, that's all. In the middle. Where is Yusuf, by the way? We're playing the finals, and he's AWOL. -Chief Metin. -What? -They are asking for you. -We're busy here! -Can we continue? -Serdar. Stop whining. I asked you to play defence for two minutes. Two minutes? It's been an hour! You pulled your star striker back here! Now, we can't score, and you can't save anything! Serdar. Come here. Catch! -Hey! Hey! -Run! Run! Aysen. Let us have Yusuf at least. We are down two players. It's killing us. Metin... It's that bad, huh? Serdar, your match is harder than ours. Chief, this final game sucks. We need a rematch next week. Hell no, Metin. You'll have to accept the result. -Let's go, man. -Come on. Let's go. Pass! Aysen. You're giving me a lecture, I get it. You're doing it during the game, that's okay too. But why the hell is he here? Get away from me, Serdar. You smell ripe. You say I'm giving you a lecture? Wow! -It is a lecture. -What lecture, Serdar? I've been waiting to hear from you for days. You never called. I tried to be the bigger person and called you, but your phone was off. I did call, you never answered. And you haven't been to the bank. What was I supposed to do, go to your house? Right! You'd have to explain yourself to Mr. Prosecutor. Watch your mouth. Don't make me take it out on you. -Yusuf is right, Serdar. -How? "How?" I pulled out all the stops. I talked my father into meeting you, and you were a no-show. You disappeared, Serdar. I'm a radio host. I work odd hours. By the way, why am I meeting your dad? Are we in Norway? Don't waste your breath, Aysen. He's scared of your father. It's been two years, and they haven't met. No, Yusuf. It's not that bad. Please. It's been 1 year, 10 months and 26 days, Serdar. If you two keep pushing me, I'll go and face your father. I'll say, "Is it a crime to love, Sir?" You'll see. -"Is it a crime to love?" -Look at him. I can't believe you, Serdar. Seriously. You made a fool of me at the bank. With that so-called "proposal". Your prank scared the hell out of me. I'm asking for this one thing from you. An apology. You're still being glib about it! Whoa! -That leg is broken. -Referee! Serdar, sit down. I'm trying to talk to you. -Serdar, sit back down. -Alright. You keep saying you're overwhelmed at work, but you have time to be here. -Why is that relevant? -It is, Serdar! You are mine this Sunday. Period. When was the last time we took a walk by the seaside? -Well, this Sunday is a no-go. -Why? -Maybe you shouldn't tell her. -Why? I'm not going alone. Yusuf and I are going camping. Wow, Serdar. How complacent can you be? I'm expecting you to make it up to me, and you say you're going camping? It's no ordinary camp. It's super glamorous. What kind of a camp is that? No, Aysen. You know how Serdar is. He's exaggerating. It's just a regular trip. I'm exaggerating? You know he sold his car to pay his military service exemption fee. -Yeah. -He paid the fee... ...and we used the rest of the money to pay for this trip. All of it. Think about it. What? I asked you to lend me some money. You said, "I used that money to pay off my debts, bro". -You liar! -Hang on! Hang on! Wait a minute, hang on. This is a misunderstanding. This is clearly a misunderstanding. Why? Didn't you say "no" when I asked if you'd seen Aysen lately? I did. You talked to her yesterday! Why haven't you told me? Okay, okay! I'm not a sandbag, enough! And you call my girlfriend "bro"? Moron! -Okay, Serdar. -"Bro"? Really? Don't change the subject, Serdar. You are taking me this Sunday. To that camp, or whatever it is. You are! I have a question: I'll take you anywhere you want... ...but why does this douche have to come along? I don't care, Serdar. I don't care. Man, what is this? He's been snoring the entire trip. Serdar, stop whining. I'm on vacation with my fiancée. Why is this douche here? Serdar, calm down. You'll wake him up. He needs to be more considerate. Why is he here, third wheeling us? You said it yourself: Being considerate. I wish Yusuf could teach you a few things about that. I said I wanted to join you, and he paid for everything. Did he complain? Did he say anything? -He needs to stop snoring to talk. -Serdar, just watch the road. Honey, I can't watch the road, you mesmerize me. By the way, you still haven't answered my proposal. You know, it's not that easy, Serdar. I know. Of course it's not easy. When I walked around with those flowers, everyone stared at me. I walked all that distance. -What distance? -You know, from the car to the bank. Then there's the whole jewellery store thing. It took me so long to pick out a ring, I hurt my neck. Wow, Serdar. Dramatize much? You do something sweet for once, but never without whining. But I'm definitely not complaining. This is a big improvement compared to last year. It's a huge step forward after those prayer beads you gifted me. You never appreciated those beads. They were fire! Perfect in every way. I don't get you, Serdar. I still don't get you. And that message? That "special" message. That special message is my thing. It's my signature. Something I send to people special to me. And to this day, only one has met that criteria: You. -So that you can truly know me. -I have. That's true. How did it go, by the way? "I am the bad boy that your mother warned you against, sweet cheeks." You called me "sweet cheeks", Serdar. That message almost ended me, but whatever... Ended you? How? What happened? Are we there yet? Yes! We're at a stopover. Don't go back to sleep, they'll serve muffins in a minute. Grab me two. What's that? Why is that man sitting on the road? Serdar, there's an old man there. Let's pull over, see if we can help. -You are full of demands today. Here. -Serdar! -I'm pulling over. -Let me see. -Sir, are you all right? -Do you have a smoke? -What? -Smoke? Cigarettes? What's wrong, Sir? Did your blood pressure drop or something? I have a farm down the road. I was going back there. Okay, we can take you to your village if it's on our route. -Do you have a cigarette? -We do, Sir. Here, come. Be careful, Sir. Here we go. Be careful. So, whatever. Time has passed, of course. Their son married a girl from Pinarbasi. Her name was Hatice or something. I don't remember. Are we not there yet? Your village is pretty far away. Keep going. We still have some distance to go. Why is your farm so far away from the village? What's your deal? You didn't even give me a cigarette. Stop complaining. By the way, we're in Sakarya. Why do you have a Kayseri accent? Insolent brat! What are you doing, Sir? Sir, where did you find that? -What happened? -That was an exploding cigarette! What? Why do you have exploding cigarettes? -Sir! -It was for a prank, Serdar. Exploding cigarettes? Is this the 90's? Get some vampire teeth while you're at it! -We just wanted to prank you, Serdar. -God... -Sir! -Is that a squirt ring? God damn you! Serdar! Serdar, he's got no pulse. -Is he dead? -Squirt some water, maybe he'll wake up. Don't be ridiculous, Serdar! Pull over! Mister! Serdar, he's got no pulse! Pull over! Please! You're going to have to stop anyway. Hide the ring. -Serdar, stop joking around! -Alright. Stay calm. Stay calm, okay. I'll put my seatbelt on. Right? Okay, okay. Serdar, should we call Chief Metin? Maybe he can help. Yeah, call him, man. Call Chief Metin. Stop talking and pray for the dead. You've been nagging at me all day. Serdar Gokalp. Son of Zeki and Filiz Gokalp. Famous radio host Serdar Gokalp. Which station are you on? Sir, what does that have to do with what's going on? Did I ask you, Miss? Did I? If you're a famous radio host... ...you should be an example of a man, right? What is this? What is this? Sir, it was just a prank. It was a joke. Shut up! A prank? The man is dead! Dead! Sir, how were we supposed to know he would die? Sit down. Sit! What a mess. Look at you. Spoiled brats from Istanbul. Because of you, an innocent villager... God, give me strength. Sir, it's all my fault. They are not to blame. Let them go. The judge will decide that. Sir, you've read the report. It must be in there. The man's episode started before he got in our car. -Yes, Sir. His time had come. -Sit down! -It hadn't. It hadn't come. -Sit! This is not a joke. The man is dead. Even if his family doesn't press charges, there will be a criminal case. I say family, but it was only him and his poor son. Poor Ziya. Poor, poor Ziya. This is a country where the rule of law reigns supreme, not the rule of pranks! This is no banana republic! Get your act together! Come in! Commander. -Ziya's son Erol is here. -Let him in. Let's see how you will face Erol now. -Have a seat, Erol. -I wouldn't dare, Sir. Sit down, Son. My condolences, Erol. -Thank you, Sir. -My condolences. These two idiots did it. And the girl too. Sir, that can't be. It must have been his time. They didn't do anything wrong. He had started to do his prayers in bed lately. He wanted to go to the farm today. I told him not to go. I said, "don't go". He went. -May he rest in peace. -May he rest in peace. My condolences. So, Erol, you won't file a complaint? No, Sir. I'm not one to find solace in blame. If you'll excuse me, Sir... You can go, Erol. -Our condolences. -Our condolences. -May he rest in peace. -May he rest in peace. May he... You better thank God for Erol. You're free to go because he won't press charges. However, if he changes his mind and files a complaint... ...I will grab you by the neck and bring you in. Now, get out of here! Go! Leave! -Let's go. -Go! Serdar Gokalp. You two can go. Go, Miss. Get out! Come here. Take this. Your car doesn't have insurance. Oh, is that all? Thank you so much, Sir. Sir, are those praying beads? Get out! Leave! If you know something, tell me. Don't keep me out of the loop. No. Why would I hide anything from you? Stop overreacting. -Aysen... -I said no. He's here. -Have a nice day. -Thank you. So, what did he say? Nothing. He asked for the station's frequency. What did you say? My migraine is killing me. Come on, let's go find a place to stay. Can you give me a ride to the village? I'll even carry you on my back! Let's go. Serdar, you help Erol. I can drive. Yeah, sure. Let's go. Come on. Thank you. Erol, we're really sorry about what happened today. It all happened in a flash... ...but believe me, we didn't mean it to turn out like that. Again, we're really sorry. I'm sick off your bullshit! Drive! Erol... Mr. Erol... We're so sorry, Sir! We're really sorry! Mr. Erol, what are you doing? -I thought that arm didn't work. -Look at it now! -My prayers fixed it, I guess. -Shut up! They said you wanted to talk. Yes. I'll tell you everything. Aysen Ozturk. Born in 1989. Registered in Is part a. Metin... I am not "Metin" here, Aysen. A serious crime's been committed. Serdar is dead. I should have listened to him when he called me. Anyway, let's stop talking like friends and get down to business. We've been waiting for you to pull yourself together to talk. I planned everything. The whole thing. Why? What was your problem? Well... It's hard to answer that question. There were multiple reasons. But I didn't want things to turn out this way... Who is this man? -You know him. You questioned him. -God, give me strength. Didn't your prosecutor father teach you anything? I asked him a million times, I'll ask you a million times if I want to. Serdar is dead, and you're still... God, help me. Erol, may I ask you something? Wasn't that leg of yours lame? You're asking this and not how your friends are doing? My friends... My fiancée Aysen. What did you do to them? Where are they? Listen to me, punk. From now on, you are at my command. You'll do whatever I say. Man, what is this? Who are you? What's going on? Shut your mouth! Do as I say, and I'll let you and your friends go. Okay? You'll take this to a certain location at a certain time. -What's in it? -Exploding cigarettes. You know. For God's sake, is this a prank? Yusuf! Where are you? Is this your doing? Come out! I'll show you the real prank! Here. You now have the MP commander's number on your phone. Feel free to call him. Tell him that we've threatened you, that we've kidnapped your friends. Your words against Erol the peasant's. I have one good hand. I can write a petition if you want. That is if you'd like to know how it is in prison. Your father is dead, and this is what you are doing. -Hey! -What are you doing? I'm just a radio host! Please, Sir! What the hell is this? I mean, what are we doing here? Bad guys, weapons... It's like a B movie. You should just toss me on a hotel's lawn to tick all the clichés. Great idea. Get out, go! "Put the package inside the safe in Room 176 in two hours." "And grab whatever's in the safe." Take him away. Take him. -Serdar, my man! How's it going? -Chief, there's an emergency. Aysen, Yusuf and I were on a trip. We decided to help an old man on the way. He smoked a cigarette, exploded and died. Turns out he had a heart condition. Serdar, you know I love your jokes, but I can't do this right now. I have work to do, okay? Later, when I have the time. I'm not joking. I swear to you, I'm not. Tunay, I'll deal with him personally. We'll talk later, okay? Chief, hello? "Call the chief again if you want." Hey! Come on, Mother! We've made it! -Welcome, Sir. -My man. My queen. Okay? You can take the van. Here. Come, Mother. -Hello. I'd like to get a room. -Sure, may I have your ID? They took my wallet. It's all good. ID? Driver's licence? Credit cards? What? What did you do to my phone? -Can I bring my ID after I check in? -Unfortunately, that's not possible. I won't stay long. There's this package... I'll just change my clothes, take a shower and leave. I'm sorry, Sir. Young man! Isn't that a peace necklace? 1968 generation. Bob Marley and all. Are you a hippie? Mehmet, gently. -Gently? -Gently, Mother. What's the problem here? -Mr. Serdar? -Hello. -Welcome. -Thank you. I was trying to get his identification, Miss Derya. I'll take care of this, Asli. Mr. Serdar, follow me please. Easy. Here, Mother. Hello. It was a little mishap. I left the car with a mechanic. -I wanted to get some rest. -You're on vacation by yourself? No, with friends. My fiancée as well. They'll be here. How about you? Have you made up with your friend? -That prank call didn't end well. -On the contrary, Mr. Serdar. She lost her job after that, and I was promoted. I am the manager now. Thanks to you. I owe you. No, don't even mention it. Can we do something about the room though? Sure, right away. Asli, I'd like you to reserve a scenic room. -For a special guest. -176. I stayed in that room before. I'm emotionally attached to it. I can still remember its smell. We'd like to book Room 176. "We"? Mr. Serdar, that room is taken. The gentleman that came with you took it. How? I arrived before them. They are probably not settled in yet. Can we change it? I know, but they've already reserved the room. I can come up with other solutions just for you. No need. I'll just take the next room. As you wish. I'll let the staff know, they'll help you check in. Thank you, thank you. "You have an hour left." Young man! This room doesn't have any freebies. Go get them. You can call the front desk, Sir. They'll help you. "They'll help you if you call." The phone won't work. Go get some. -Which room is it, Sir? -177. Hurry up, come on. Quickly, go fast. No, I'm just an employee. Answer me. Who sent you here? Auntie, I... Call me "auntie" again, and I'll rip your tongue off! Watch your mouth, boy! -You have an accomplice too? -No, I don't know him. -Talk or I'll kill your friend. -I don't know him. Madam, what are you doing? You are a peaceful hippie! -Miss Tugce, please! -Shut up! Tugce? The hell? Hey! Mom! Mom! What are you doing? Who are you? Mom, what are you doing? It's me, your son. Drop the gun. Mom, drop it, for God's sake. -Let me go! -Drop it! -Let me go! -It's okay, don't be scared. There's nothing to be scared of. It's a water gun. It's a water gun! Water gun! Water! Go now, piss off. Go! Mom, let him go! What are you doing? You head locked him! Let him go! Dude, show some effort to get up! You're lying down like a lazy cat! -Wait, my foot! -Are you okay? I'm okay, Sir. I am okay. Water. It's a water gun. Mom, what are you doing, waving that gun around? You're going to get us in trouble. Get back inside. Hello? Hi. I can't open my safe. Can you send someone to help? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, man. Thanks a lot. Good job, thanks. If you'd like to set a new password... I'll handle the rest. Thank you. Thanks. May I come in, young man? Are you alone? Yes, Sir. -Let's take a walk together. -Inside the room? Are you making fun of me, smart-ass? How are we going to take a walk in a four square meter room? I'm sorry. You mean outside, okay. Let's go. Sir, I have urgent business. I won't stay here long anyway. -Let's go. -Sure, sure. I can cancel my plans. After you. After you. After you, Sir. -Drink, young man. -Apricot juice upsets my stomach. You should've said so, we would've asked for peach. Sorry for that mess in the hallway. My mother has been like that lately. She is getting old, you know. I said "sorry". Aren't you going to say "no need, things happen, you don't need to apologize"? No need to apologize. You can squirt water in my face anytime. You are so kind. Man, oh, man... Razor Mehmet... People make fun of you now. No, Sir, not at all. You misunderstood. It is what it is, young man. There was a time when the name "Razor Mehmet"... ...would make people piss their pants out of fear. But I am done with that life. I promised myself that I wouldn't break hearts or bones. -Promise? -Promise. I decided to become a hippie. I thought I might find peace there. You could have gone on Hajj. I applied for that too. I'll go when they draw my number. -How long has it been? -Yesterday. I applied yesterday. You wait a maximum of seven years. If they don't draw your number until then, they just take you directly. No, that's not what I meant. When did you repent? Yesterday. I said "yesterday", didn't I? I repented and immediately applied for Hajj. What's not to understand? Repent, Hajj. Repent... May God see your efforts. You repent and go on Hajj, yeah. -Hello. -Hello. Would you like to join us? No, thank you, I'm on a diet. Are you okay, young man? You poor thing! Here here, Mr. Serdar. -Here, take a sip. It would help. -It's the same juice. Mr. Mehmet, we talked to Miss Tugce. She forgave us. We instructed our staff too. We are really sorry for the inconvenience. No need to apologize. Things happen. He's a young man. It was an honest mistake. Thank you. I need to take this. Have fun. -Mr. Mehmet? -Huh? You're not staying in the same room with your mother Tugce, right? Why do you ask? Well, you said she was old, you know. She's not only my mother, but also my master and mentor. Yes. We were just a little baby, no bigger than this little finger. She left us with our aunt and left for Tibet to learn yoga. -Tibet? -Tibet. I won't ask how she left the village and went to Tibet. Yoga, being a hippie... You used to be a gangster too. You repented and stuff. How do all this come together? I'll tell you all about it. One by one. Listen... I need to take care of a small issue. The gendarmerie is here. Please enjoy yourselves. Gendarmerie? The necklace... Go check inside. Well, well, well... Give me the package. So, you are the courier we've been looking for. Not at all, Sir. I'm here to accompany my elderly mother. Let me go! Let my mother go! Come here, stop with the act. What is this? What is it? -What? -What is this? -What is it? -What? What is it? I don't know, Commander. I don't know. Sir, please. We have guests here. Miss, we are trying to enforce the law here. Please don't interfere. Take the woman away. Is this colonel commandant also involved, Mehmet? Hold on. -Colonel commandant, auntie? -Auntie? Insolent brat. When were you born? Sergeant major. Take her away. Take this jerk too. Mother! Put him in the back. Look at this woman. "No Woman No Cry". Mother, come. Serdar! Aysen? Are you alright? You're okay, right? Are you okay? Hippies! Look at all you've done! God, give me strength. They actually tried to warn Serdar. He was about ask how it worked, being a hippie and doing yoga... ...but Derya intervened. You messed with his head! They kidnapped his fiancée, he didn't know what to do. It was obvious that he was in grave danger. Shame on you! God, forgive me. Let's talk about Miss Derya now. Or should we say "Just Derya"? Just Derya. If you need anything else, feel free to ask. -I'll be around. -Thanks. What's with that look, Serdar? What? I just thanked her, you saw it. Do you really want to talk about this right now? Thanked her for what? I don't get it. What did she do? She just gave me a scarf. So, tell me what happened. I don't know where they took us Serdar. I regained consciousness at one point. They were taking Yusuf away. That's all I know. Did they hurt you? You looked rough in that photo. No. In fact, they treated me rather well. They kept saying how precious I was. I didn't get it. How did you end up here? They dropped me off down the road. I took the bus. -The bus? -Yes, I even found a seat. Why didn't you go to the police or the gendarmerie? Serdar, they have Yusuf. How can I do that? Serdar, how have you been? Were you here all along? Don't worry about me. You're alright, that's what matters. Serdar, hang on. Erol wanted me to give you this. -They didn't take your bag? -No, only my phone is missing. He told me not to open it. What does it say? "Grab the package inside the safe and get back here." -He wants the package inside the safe. -What safe? It was in one of the rooms. Long story. Hence the car keys. He wants us to deliver the package. But you don't have your driver's licence on you. And the car's not insured! Aysen, didn't you hear the manager? The MPs are everywhere. How are we going to get in that room? "You have two hours. Otherwise, your friend will die." The bastard even put a skull and gun emoji. "Ok." -Wait, I can send texts? -Serdar, they mean Yusuf, right? Hold that thought for a second. Why did Erol release you and keep Yusuf? He should have kept you and released Yusuf. That's what they do in movies. That's what I would have done. Okay, fine. Let's just get on with it. I mean... Maybe that manager of yours can help us. She is not mine. Are we going to talk about this right now? I don't know. I really don't. I do know how she looks at you though. Don't sigh, Serdar. You saw it too. You are something else, Mr. Serdar! Your jokes made my day again. -Serdar! -Don't mention it, it's my job. Miss Derya, we'd like to... Call me "Derya", please. Just Derya. There is no reason to be so formal, right, Ayse? Aysen. With an "N". Miss Just Derya, we need a favour. Can you get us inside Room 178? We left in a hurry, our things are still in there. They put a guard on that corridor, Mr. Serdar. They have a soldier there? We asked for the commander's permission... ...to have the guard put on our staff uniform. So that our guests wouldn't get nervous. Well, let's just cut to the point. Since you are the manager of this hotel... Will you help us or not? Mr. Serdar, you never told me how short-tempered your fiancée was. I mean, when we were talking alone. -You're pushing it! -Aysen, okay. Will you help us or not? Calm down, okay. Okay? Mr. Serdar's wishes are important to me. We can work something out. Yes but how? How would you like? -Is everybody ready? -I'm ready. Aysen, we're waiting for you. Okay. Okay, I'm ready too. Housekeeping. Housekeeping. -Young man, what's your name? -Adem. I'm Adem. Adem, help me with this. It's not moving. Just push it, it will move. Well, it's not. Come here for a minute. I can't, man. I'm burning! Adem, run! Help me! Aysen, your turn. Stop ordering me around. Aysen, we are racing against the clock. Hurry up please. Fine, I'm on my way. My leg! Be careful, man! Man! My leg... -It hurts! -I can't lift it. It hurts so much! -I can't lift it. -It hurts! It hurts! Man, your leg is bleeding. Bleeding? I have hemophobia. -Man! Please, wake up! -Don't hit so hard, idiot! -Man... -Keep distracting him. My leg hurts so much, Adem! My leg hurts! Man? Go get me a towel or something. Hurry, go. Go! Aysen, it's your turn now. Aysen? Aysen? -Something must have gone wrong. -Check the security feed. Serdar, I told you, honey. The rooms don't have any cameras. Something definitely went wrong. She didn't even react to your "honey". Aysen? This isn't working. I'm going in to check. Derya, wait! Keep distracting the soldier. Derya, wait, wait... I'm dying over here! My leg! -Man. -Get over here, here. What are those? This is all I could find in the bathroom. You could have brought wet wipes at least! I'm burning! Pour some water on me! -I can't do it all at the same time! -Pour water! I'm burning! Pour water! Do something! Pour it! I'm burning! Take those bottles, they are fresh out of the cooler. Come on. Pour! Adem, I feel dizzy! Pour water on me, Adem! Pour water on me! I'm dizzy! I'm dizzy, Adem! Pour the water! I'm dying here! Go find some wet wipes or something. Hurry! Go! Go... Aysen, what are you doing? -She had it coming, Serdar. -What did you do? She should be glad I didn't kill her. We're in so much trouble already, and you're doing this? "Mr. Serdar this, Mr. Serdar that." She deserved it. She should have kept her distance from you. Hang on. I rubbed some dry tea on myself, it took away the pain. Look, I'm fine. See? Perfectly fine. -Man... -Get back to work. But the blood? I'll talk to the manager, get you a bonus. Go back to work, okay? Thank you. Miss Safiye, let me help you. What will we do with her now? I don't know, can't we just throw her in the trash? -She's not medical waste. -I don't care. She should have known better than being all over you. -You could have left her in there. -Yeah, right. And what would happen when they find her? There are cameras everywhere! We are being filmed already! Serdar... Oh, here we go again. "You have one hour left." The bastard is like a cuckoo clock. Serdar, I'm so sorry. -Did you grab whatever was in the safe? -I did. -Is this it? -This was the only thing in the safe. We could have bought this from the store downstairs. Serdar... Anyway, let's move her. We can't let her wake up here. If she wakes up on the road, we can just apologize. Serdar, the roads are filled with MPs. You don't even have your licence on you. Aysen, calm down. You're being irrational. We're in this together. Calm down, you're not being yourself. We are together in this. Okay? -Serdar, they have Yusuf. -It's okay. Get that end, come on. Come on, let's go. -She's so heavy! -How many people are in this? I don't know, I just wrapped her in it. Let me change my clothes. Serdar, he's looking at us, smile. Is the car in the parking lot? Yes. Go faster, Serdar. -What are you doing? -What? You're going too fast! Serdar, hold it! -Serdar, they took all our bags. -Aysen, what are you doing? Won't we put her here? But it's too big. We won't be able to close the lid. Let's just keep it open. We can tie it with rope. Aysen, this isn't a dead body. We're not kidnappers. Come here. Open the door. -Help me. -It's heavy, be careful. On three. Together. One, two, three. Serdar, she's so heavy! -Together. -Come on. One, two, three. -You're crushing me, Serdar. -Crushing you? Pull! Pull! Let's pull over. There's no one around. Serdar, I'm scared. We just got on the road. Calm down. I could swear, we're in a B movie right now. We have a person in a box. I'm just a radio host. And I work at a bank, Serdar. What's your point? She did that to herself, going "Mr. Serdar this, Mr. Serdar that". For God's sake! I'm pulling over. Sure. -What are you doing? -Won't we take it out? Are we magicians? How will you pull her out of a box in the middle of the road? Cut her in two while you're at it! Here, let's just tear it open. Tear it. Easy, easy. I'll hold her, you pull the cardboard away. She's unconscious. "She's unconscious!" Don't you prefer it that way? Take it easy, Aysen! Come on. Come on! One, two, three. Pull! By the way, how did you know about my driver's licence? Did I tell you about that? Miss Derya? Miss Derya? Did you chloroform her? She won't wake up. Why didn't you wrap her in a carpet like Emel Say in? "Like Emel Say in!" Good God! You can't wake her up by caressing her cheeks. Let me show you how it's done. Miss Derya! Miss Derya! Wow! Here you go! She's awake! Serdar! She has a gun! A gun! Miss Just Derya, why do you have these guns? How? Where did they come from? Where's the necklace? -Where's the necklace? -It's in my pocket. Hand it over. Get in, we're leaving. I said get in! We're leaving. Let me put my seatbelt on. Gems... The necklace had gems in it. I told you, Serdar. I told you she'd kill us. I told you something was off about her. As always, you didn't listen to me. So, you're working with Erol... I mean, Mr. Erol. Who cares about Erol? He's nothing but a wannabe mobster. Why would I work with him? So, you are the big mobster? Like Suleyman Cakir and Testere Necmi? Do I look like a mobster? Well, Testere Necmi is a businessman. -But he did Laz Ziya wrong. -What? Erol, you know... He thought he could steal the necklace with that nut-sized brain of his. What's going on? What is this? It's Erol! Step on it! -How did they know where we were? -Where are we anyway? I said go! Faster! -Roll it down! -Roll what down? -The window! Roll it down! -The child safety should be on. You don't have children! What child safety? -Serdar! -I just got the car. Erol's men must have done it. If I had it, I would have gotten it insured. -Okay, shut up! Roll down the window! -Do it, Serdar. -Is it working? -Shut up! Drive! Watch the road. Serdar, they're firing at us! They're shooting at us! Get down! Calm down, Miss Derya! Miss Just Derya, what are you doing? The gendarmerie will be all over us! Stop screaming! And stop driving all over the place! Calm down, we're safe. I wouldn't want to meddle, but how is this safe? You're shooting out of a moving car! Go! Go! Step on it! I'm flooring it! I can't go any faster! Step on it! I said faster! -Stop swinging around! -I can't! There's a gun pointed at me! -Serdar! -Stop screaming! Watch the road. Serdar... Serdar, the gendarmerie. Serdar. Serdar, the commander is there. Okay, calm down. We're safe. -Serdar. -Are they crazy? They're shooting at the MPs in the middle of the road. Erol must have lost it. Serdar, I think I'm going to pass out. I don't feel well. Calm down. We're in this together, okay? Stay with me. Look at my eyes, stay with me. If we don't get out of here now, we'll all end up in body bags. Serdar, I'm so scared! Aysen, I'm sorry! This is all my fault! Please forgive me! Why would you say that? Serdar, let's just get out, or we'll die here! Let's go, Serdar. -Aysen, hurry! Hurry! -How the hell are you here? Not now. I'll tell you everything. Hurry! Serdar! Serdar... On three, we'll run into the woods. -Three! Three! -Serdar! Are you okay? Let's go, hurry! -What? -Serdar... The commander is involved. I'll tell you all about it. -Run! Run! -Come here. Serdar, stop! Put me down! I can walk! My legs aren't broken! My head is killing me. Are you trying to replicate the Olympic flame or something? We'll sit for two minutes. We left the car behind. Serdar... He saved our lives. Who cares about the car? You should be thanking him. You are something else. Sorry, man. Can you take off this bow tie? It's choking me. Here. They took Aysen away, put me in a filthy room. Then they started to panic. They were discussing something. "The manager found out about the necklace" or something. One of Erol's men looked into it. It turns out the commander has told Derya about it. Who is this Derya? She's definitely not a hotel manager. She's up to no good. Guys, we should spend the night here. What do you think? Why? We should go to the police or to the MPs and tell them everything. Do we have any proof? We are going on trial for manslaughter in two days. We didn't kill him, dude! The report says so. -Well, the commander disagrees! -The commander can go to... Will you really fight here, with the mess we are in? I'm sure Erol's after us too. Why would he be after us? We don't have what he wants anymore. Does he know that? And he lost me. He must be running mad. Aysen? Aysen? It'll be a cold night. We should fan the flames. We may be able to take it, but not Aysen. We're in the middle of summer. What can possibly happen? -You know all about it, mister ranger! -I know more than you. Piss off. Man, I'll just gather some wood to burn. What do you think? Stop being so stubborn. Fine, go. Don't be too long. Find dry wood. These are green, they won't burn. Okay, okay. Where are they? Where are your friends? Sir, I just woke up. You saw me. -Weren't you together? -No, I was alone here. Don't lie to me, bastard! -Where is my bow tie? -Your bow tie? Hit him! What are you doing? What is going on? According to Findlt Research Centre... ...men will usually receive messages about football games... -...between 11 and 1 o'clock. -You're funny, man. Between 1 and 3 o'clock... ...they'll receive messages telling them to come to work early. Turn it off. The man himself woke up. Between 3 and 6 o'clock... Your show is not bad at all. -What time is it? -Why? You got a date? No, my show is on at night. Maybe they think you're dead. So, it's a memorial episode. -Where are we going? -The MPs are patrolling the area. We can't stay out in the open like some idiots do. I'm sorry, I'm not a gangster like you, so I wouldn't know. You need to change your clothes, man. Those will fuse onto your skin. Where is this courage coming from? What's up? Let me tell you something. Those friends of yours... I feel like they are a little too close. She's your fiancée and all, so I thought I should tell you. -Watch your mouth. -Listen to me! I haven't decided what to do with you yet. So watch your mouth. Don't piss me off. Boss. Stop! God damn commander. That cuckold bastard. You mean "cockeyed", idiot. Nope. I think he hit the nail on this one. "Cuckold" is the right word here. Well, I'll be damned. They made a deal with the commander and sold you out. Your fiancée, your friend... -Damn. -Shut up. Why, man? We'll be prison buddies. I have a question, by the way: How will you walk around with those horns? Won't they get stuck on stuff? Mister radio host! Have I ever told you what kind of dirt bag your commander is? You, come here, start talking. Bring him over. It's a sad story though. No crying, Commander, okay? -Promise not to cry. -Get him out. Drop the cover. Come here. I dare you to untie me. -Lie him down. -Commander? -Lie him down. -What are you doing? -Lie him down now! -Please don't. After setting it all up, I went to Mr. Erol's theatre. I told him about the plan. We had a long conversation about what we would do. Mr. Erol hired the actors. The hotel, the guns, all the actors... Where did you get the money for it? -Yusuf helped me. -How? He had sold his car to pay his exemption fee. He gave me the rest of the money. How much did Serdar's life cost? How much did it cost? How much? Boy, lift the cover. Look at me. Save us the trouble... ...bad boy. Drop it, boy. The boy is running away! I repeat, he's getting away! Plan B! Turn around! Go, go, go! Keep shooting, Commander. I'm about to end you. Follow me, Commander. Come, follow me. Lift that damn branch! Don't lose sight of him! Surround him! I'm 60 years old! He's running like a hound! The bastard turned into Rambo in the forest! You go that way! Go! What is this? What the hell is this? Find him yourselves. I'm out of juice. What the hell? I'm done. What the hell? Where the hell are you? Commander, what's up? Did you watch the videos? Yes, keep making fun of me, Serdar Gokalp. I'll find you. Five minutes tops. Commander, those videos are about to go on every TV channel. No disrespect, but a gendarmerie commander... ...shooting guns in the middle of the road in broad daylight? The news stations will eat it up like chocolate cake. What do you want? Be straight. Tell me where Aysen and Yusuf are. I'll also get your share of the gems. How's that going to work? I'll give you an address. Be there. What did you do, Commander? Are these boys involved too? Just take what you want and leave. No one gets hurt. Don't you dare. The moment I press this button, the videos will be sent to the networks. Leave the scene! Leave the scene now! Abort mission! Are the diamonds here? Son, go on. Let me take them. Come on. Where are Yusuf and Aysen? You'll know once you get the gems. Are we still playing a game, Commander? How will I know you don't have a copy of those videos? How can you know that? How can you... -God, give me strength. -What are you scheming now? -Damn it! You called the cops! -Now, we are screwed. -You shouldn't have done that! -Lower your guns! Officer, this is a misunderstanding! Serdar! Serdar! Serdar! Serdar! Serdar! Serdar! Serdar! Serdar! Serdar! I wish I had known what a single prank could cost you. "I wanted payback for the proposal prank..." ...the deceased Serdar Gokalp pulled on me. So I planned a prank against him. I was going to say yes to him with this prank. My father, Ridvan Ozturk, a retired prosecutor... "...wanted to join in the prank to get to know his future son-in-law better." What was his role? -The commander. -No name? We always called him "commander". There was no need. God, give me patience. "We informed the officials that we would be filming a video for our wedding..." ...and got permission. We only fired blanks during the gunfights. Things got out of control when Serdar Gokalp ran away. But we continued with the prank. The deceased was supposed to be given a piece of paper... ...stating that I'm saying yes to his proposal. "I've read my statement. I have nothing else..." Hang on. Let's add this: "We also put Serdar Gokalp through a test during the prank." If he took the money he saw in the hotel room... ...I was going to say no to his proposal and end the prank. "And Derya, who was tasked with making advances towards him..." Derya... He didn't even glance at her. Even when he needed her. "He rejected Derya Bay bars' advances, proving his commitment." Room 176 was also chosen as a clue for Serdar Gokalp... ...referring the prank in the bank. "I have read my statement. I have nothing else to add." Metin... Metin... Please let me see Serdar one last time. You wouldn't be able to take it. Please. I thought you were beyond the horizon. And I laughed at myself. But how would you know that? I thought you were beyond the horizon. And I laughed at myself. But how would you know that? I was like a glacier fooled by your mirage. And I melted into nothing. But how would you know that? I was like a glacier fooled by your mirage. And I melted into nothing. But how would you know that? How would you know that? The years passed as I've become more desperate. I tried to play my troubles to the tune of fun. The years passed as I've become more desperate. I tried to play my troubles to the tune of fun. The whole world was around me, yet I always felt lonely. I eventually left this world, but how would you know that? The whole world was around me, yet I always felt lonely. I eventually left this world, but how would you know that? How would you know that? Serdar... Will you marry me, Aysen? God... Serdar. -Aysen! -I'm not dead. -Come here. Hurry. -Chief, she passed out again. Aysen? Why did it take so long? I was about to die for real. Aysen! By the way, I convinced the guys. We have a rematch tomorrow. Chief, please. She's unconscious. Not now. Let's wake her up first. Aysen? By the way, your father-in-law is furious. -What? -I messed with him. How? I was a little too into it. I put a gun to his head. Let's wake Aysen first, then we'll talk. He'd better not shove that gun in our mouths. Aysen, come on now. -Aysen. -Aysen. Look at me. Save us the trouble, bad boy. "I am the bad boy that your mother warned you against, sweet cheeks." Sir, are those praying beads? But I'm definitely not complaining. This is a big improvement compared to last year. It's a big step forward after those prayer beads you gifted me last year. What do you want? Be straight. I'll give you an address. Be there. "The Last Prank" To hell with your chat. You asked for the rematch, I set it up. But look at you. It's impossible, man. Even if Aysen forgives you, her father won't. You're done. It's over. Not at all, man. I didn't disrespect him in any way. It's all Metin's fault. They can work it out themselves. They are basically colleagues. Why are you pushing me? The bullets were blank... ...but what would you do if I pulled the trigger on my head there? We forgot because of Ridvan's nagging. I don't know. A retired prosecutor is still a retired civil servant. He had a say in everything. Every single thing. If you can't pull a proper prank, just leave it to professionals. We were in a war zone, bullets were flying. But my battery was 99 percent. What kind of technology is that? They were charging it. I don't know. We needed to be able to contact you. I told them though. I said, "don't leave him alone". I did. I said, "we have to distract him". Stop whining, man. You're not the one who lost all that money. How much is "all that money"? Are you making fun of me? -How much did you spend? How much? -Piss off. How much? Tell me, how much?
