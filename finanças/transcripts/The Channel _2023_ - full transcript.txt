Day two, in the sandbox. In a convoy, on the 81st. I'm sittin' up top, at the gunner seat. Fucking hearts beating through my chest 'cause I... I heard it's the most dangerous stretch of road in the country. Fuck yeah, it is. What could go wrong? So we're cruising along. All of a sudden, I see this fucking Hajji on the side of the road. And he's going to town - on a fuckin donkey... - He's got... Hang on a minute! A fucking donkey? Bro, he's got his little Hajji dress hiked up over his shoulders bangin' away. - How do you even do that? - Super fucking weird, right? I even said somethin' to Gunny about it but he shrugs it off. So we don't get another six klicks down the road, I see another fucking Alibaba off in the distance ridin' one of his own behind this broken down Humvee. What, like another donkey in the butthole? - [laughs] - So what happened next? More of the same. I must've seen like fuckin' four more pairs of 'em. Gettin' after it on the way back to the farm. right? What? - So... uh... - [rubs hands together] It gets worse. All right, so we get back to the motor pool and I see this old dirty bastard about yay high, with a wooden leg sittin' on the hood of the major's Humvee, jerkin' off. - You're kidding. - What? - Yeah... - How the fuck do you even get in there? So Gunny looks up to me, can see how fuckin' rattled I am, right? Then he asks me what my malfunction is. I mean, my malfunction, I'm telling you, the whole fucking way here I'm seeing dudes bangin' donkeys on the side of the road. There's this guy with a wooden leg beatin' off in the motor pool in broad daylight and you know what he says to me? What'd he say? "Marine, you can't expect a guy with a wooden leg to catch a fucking donkey." - [men laughing] - Crazy motherfucker. - [laughing continues] - Jesus Christ. We here. What's your problem? Why you poutin'? Bitch, I ain't fuckin' poutin'. - Yeah, you are. - Fuck you. Let's rock and roll. [suspenseful music] I know the transfer took a little bit longer than we wanted, but we appreciate your business [man groans] andwe appreciate your trust. Everybody freeze! Don't you fuckin' move! - [woman screams, moans] - Hands away from the weapons, all. - Nah nah nah nah nah. - Think it through. - [woman panicking] - Everybody fuckin' relax. You heard him. Don't fuckin' move. - Stop! - Shut up! All right, you heard the man. Let's start with you three ladies right there. Hands laced on top of your head. Back away from the counter. Let's go.

[heavy gunfire] [tires squeal] Come on, motherfuckers. Come on... [grunts] Turn here! Here! [tires squeal] [groans] - Come on, come on! - [heavy breathing] - [sirens approaching] - [man grunts] [car engine starts] [suspenseful music plays] [tires squeal] [grunts] -Yo, get down! Get the fuck down! -[sirens blare] [dispatch] Dispatch, we have multiple officers down at first National Bank, South Conti and Calhoun. Requesting air meds for location, ASAP. [dispatch 2] Citywide, all units respond. -[sirens] -[dispatch] One, O, eight. Multiple officers down. EMS, Code three. [female dispatch] All units, suspect vehicle is a 90s model, light blue, wood paneled, Chevy station wagon. Be advised, suspects are armed. With fully automatic weapons. [dispatch] Notified J.P., Saint Bernard, Saint Tammany, and State Police. Requesting shutdown of all routes out of the city. Including the Crescent City Connection, Causeway, the Twin Span, and all routes headed westbound. [sirens blare] - Gonna say nothing? - What you want me to say? What the fuck was that? FBI robbery task force. No shit. - How'd they know? - Someone ratted us. Who? We gotta wash this money. Make sure our exit's not burning, and get the fuck out. Fast. Where we gonna run? This is gonna make national news, Mick. We're fucking cop killers now. The choice is what? You hear anybody yell, "Don't move, you're under arrest"? No, you didn't. They were there to fucking murder us, and I ain't got no regrets. We left, fucking, three of our brothers in the fucking street! [beep] They made their choices. [suspenseful music] [engine starts] [suspenseful music] Two, I've already given my statement to your paid men. - Gentlemen! - You're probably not... Pace. So you're the one in charge of this shit show. That's Special Agent Frank Ross. Where the fuck were you, Special Agent? I just got off a plane from D.C. ten minutes ago. I've got six dead officers and another one in critical because of your team's cowboy shit. I understand, Lieutenant. I do. It went bad and we're here. We've gotta move past that now, so we can focus on catching these guys. "Catch 'em." It's New Orleans, Special Agent. We're gonna bury these motherfuckers. Do your thing, but don't go fucking shit on my crime scene. Remember, this is homicide first, robbery second. I understand you're upset. Emotional. You have every reason to be... But if you ever sling foul language at me again, it will be your last. Understand? [suspenseful music] So, where we at on lockdown? In motion, boss. Mayor's given us the keys. There are checkpoints everywhere. [indistinct], the causeway, all the ports, highways, bridges, roads - heading out the city. - Marinas? Yes, sir. Everything. All right, all right. I want C.R.T. teams and every precinct standing by. - So, what exactly happened? - I got a call from my buddy in Vice. Said he hooked a guy yesterday, on some sort of statutory shit. Some nobody, Edwin Smalls. That cyber security geek is looking at five to seven years in Angola. Folded like a lawn-chair. They literally called us ten minutes before the crew hit the place. I tried to phone you, but I couldn't reach you. So... I made the call. So, tell me why we couldn't take 'em at the van. Well, the block car was in motion, and we were pushin' up. Crew came out heavy like before, five and a driver. Body armor, ballistics, masks, all automatic stuff... And then, fender bender right in front of us, as we were moving in. Boris Karloff over there, at the front door, came up on his sights. I beat him to the punch. It was on. Nico took out the driver of the van. Swat got the mummy over there at the dumpster. So, I hear you winged a fourth. You sure you hit him? Oh, I hit meat. I heard the man howl. And, I tell ya, there ain't no way he makes it through the night without some serious medical attention. These guys are smart, they're way too ruthless. Find out if there are any doctors who've come up missing. Look into... vet offices, plastic surgeons, anyone who can handle trauma. On it. You know how you've been saying you thought these guys were ex-military. -Yeah -Yeah, well, you're right. We had them pinned down. And guess what those assholes go and do? - Attack the ambush. - Exactly. Wasn't till they realized they were boxed in that they started to fall back. And the ranger peeled all the way down the fence and out. - Ranger peel? - Yeah. Move, moving, covering, all at high speed shit. I gotta tell you, I haven't seen that live since Somalia. - Go on. - They jacked some kid for his station wagon. Mark unit ran him down, but that just turned into an ambush. At the switch car, 'bout, uh, six blocks over. All right. Get eyes out. We're looking for something big. You know, something that can carry all of them, something with power. We're talkin' a large SUV, three-by-three, one ton. - Copy that. - Yeah. Tell me about this van. Stole it. Three days, out of Chalmette. -Nico -Yes, sir. Who do we have over here? Bank tellers, managers en route to University Medical. Heard he put up a fight, and they tuned him up pretty good. - Pssh... Not smart. - No, sir. Hi. Now, just one moment. Detective, do you mind if I ask your witnesses a couple questions? Seriously? I got a kid I was supposed to pick up hours ago. - Go for it. I'm done. - Thank you. Ladies... My name is Special Agent Frank Ross. - Look... we just wanna go home. - I understand. I do. I just need a moment of your time. Do you remember anything... Anything specific about the gunman who did this? - Two of 'em were Y'at. - Y'at? I'm sorry, I'm sorry -I don't know what a Y'at is... Metro locals. That Brooklyn accent that you think you've been hearing around town? It ain't. That's a thing we call Y'at. Okay. All right. Uh... Which ones were Y'ats? The vampire and wolf. Okay. Thank you, thank you. That's very, very helpful. Thank you very much. Ma'am, what about you? Did you see anything? Do you remember anything? Ma'am? Guns. All I saw was guns. I mainly just kept my head down. I didn't wanna... make eye contact. That was smart. That was very smart. Okay, just breathe... It's okay. - You're gonna be okay. - [cell phone pings] Ex... excuse me, one moment. [girl] Dad, where are you? I've been waiting forever. You're not coming, are you? Tomorrow morning Works always first, right? - I should've known... - Frank, I just got word... car fire on Chapitoulas. Ladies... Thank you, thank you. Please don't hesitate to call Detective here, if you remember anything at all. Okay? All right? Thank you all again. - Thanks, Agent Ross. - Yeah. Get their details. Run 'em all through local, state, NCIC... - Will do. - You drive. [suspenseful music] [pounding on door] - Who the f... - Yo, Bill, open the door man. -Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Bro... -Yo, open the door, Bill. Whoa whoa whoa! You can't bring him in here! Jeremy, this ain't how it works! [man gags] Tell me, motherfucker, how's it work? How's it fucking work? - [man groans] - Thought you'd rat us out, didn't you? - Open your eyes, I want you to see this. - Hey, no no no. Come on, he's as fucked as we are. No no no, he fucking knew. He fucking knew. You're the only one who fuckin' knew. No, wrong. [coughs] Smalls knew. - [coughs] - What? When it hit the news, I knew... [coughs] I made a call. -NOPD picked him up yesterday. - [coughs] - Fuck. - We need another way out. - Smalls didn't know nothing about it. We don't know what the fuck he knew, what he told him... - Hey, we need to wash that shit ASAP. - No can do. My guy's out. Too much blood on it. - Blue blood. - Oh, fuck that, fuck that. Tell him we'll give him another bu... Tell him we'll give him ten percent. [laughing] He's out! I don't care if you give him 100 percent! Jamie... It's too much heat. There's fucking cash in a bag, right? Nobody's gonna fucking clean that for us? [laughs] Yeah... The one guy I can dig up that might be able to move that much weight... [laughs] That's Nussy. And, boys, the hit won't be light, Cause he's gonna take, forty, fifty percent... minimum. I mean, it is what it is, right? [Billy sighs] Fuck it. Make the fucking call. Yes, sir. Put your fucking guns down. What the fuck! -Here we go-Pearl, right? - What the fuck are you doin'? - Fuck... you! You piece of shit. You fucking coward. - Handle your business, little bro... - You fucking scum! I ain't got fucking time for this... Fuck, you promised me, Jamie, shit. You promised me... Get the fuck out of here. I'm gonna fucking kill you. I'm gonna kill you. What are you doin'?! That psycho motherfucker just killed us. Fuck! What was I thinking, Jamie? We should've known better! We should've known better. - [gasps] Fuck, Jamie! - Hey. Joan! Joan! The surgery was paid for. -Jamie, we had everything. Jamie, everything is gone now. -Shh... shh. - Stop. - What... what? - What? [gasping] - Come here. Listen. Hey... We're gonna get through this, okay? All right? How? How? How do we get through this? I'm workin' on it. All right? But you can't be here! We had a plan. You go home. You act like everything is normal. You can't be around these guys, all right? You need to listen to me. The FBI's on you. They talk to you? Yeah, yeah. They were at the bank for, like, hours. They talked to everybody. They're looking for guys from the neighborhood. They're gonna find you, Jamie. And... and... Listen... what if we just left. -What if we left right now... and you came with me right now? -Hey... Shh... - And we go get Joannie... - Stop! Stop! And we get the fuck out of here. You come with me... There's one thing that's important. You go home. That's it. Let me work! All right? You trust me? - [man screaming] - You know I do. I can't have this. You gotta get him out of here. Shut the door! Shut the door! Jamie, he's gotta go! Where the fuck am I gonna take him, Bill? - Let's take him to Clarence. - [coughing] We ain't takin' him to fucking Clarence's. Dump him at the E.R. and hope for the best. - Take him to... - Take him to fucking Clarence. I'm coming with. - What? - Yeah. No you're fucking going home. We just talked about this. I ain't leavin' you here with this fucking psychopath. - Ava. - No way! I'm not going home! You know what? That's a great idea. Cops ain't looking for no pretty brunette from the Channel. Here! You drive! I'm not leaving your side till this is over with. You fuck us... and I will be back to murder you where you stand. We clear? - [suspenseful music] - We're clear. [reporter] The surviving assailants are believed to have made off with over one point five million dollars. The New Orleans Police Department, in conjunction with the FBI's elite robbery task force unit have begun an extensive manhunt. Setting up roadblocks and checkpoints. Effectively shutting down all access points both in and out of the city. If you, or anyone you know, has any information on the whereabouts of these fugitives, the New Orleans Police Department asks that you contact them immediately. But do not approach. The assailants are considered armed and extremely dangerous. Now, let's go to George, who's standing by at University Medical, -awaiting an update on the state, -[phone buzzes] of the officers wounded in today's heinous attack. -Yo -[George over TV] Hank, the situation at the hospital - Who's this? - at the hospital is extremely grim. - Oh, yeah. - And with good reason. - Today's tragic events... - Yo, Nussy. Marked the deadliest incident... Got some fool on the line that says you knows him. Told me to tell ya, he's willing to chat. [television broadcast continues] The Jet, what you want? [broadcaster] Some arriving, still unaware. of whether their loved ones Yeah, I'm lookin' at that shit right now. These some straight up mad motherfuckers, right here. - Oh, yeah? Enlighten me. - [news continues in background] [suspenseful music plays] It's a good location to dump a car. You got 90 only seconds away, and the Irish Channel to get lost in, right there. So, what's next? We flex this. Okay? So what do we know? Three shooters. One's hurtin'. Two of 'em are probably local boys. All ex-military. Not just military... these guys are gunfighters. We're lookin' for vets with trigger time in the sandbox. I'll get Jean to reach out to DOD. - And I'll pull Jefferson and Orleans' barrage. - Good. So what exactly was the take? Walked out with three mil, got away with one point five. What was a bank in East Calhoun doing with that much cash? They just took over the temp headquarters branch, because the CBD location was going through a remodel. And today's Thursday. So, they were carrying heavy prepping' for distribution to all the other branches. Cover all those Friday payroll checks. And, how do they know all this? That's our job. You mentioned earlier, an Edwin Smalls... That's right. The rat. Smalls gave them intel and boards. What kind of boards? Some high-end, custom stuff, designed to trigger the alarm system - to shut itself off 15 minutes before the crew hit the place. - Okay. I followed up on that with the bank's security firm. They told me that they found two odd, custom boards installed in the master CPU. They're polygraphing the entire staff as we speak. So if Smalls hadn't talked, they'd have gotten away clean? Hundred percent. Hmm... I wanna speak to this nobody. This Mr. Edwin Smalls. [suspenseful music] [knocks on door] Holy shit. Get the fuck out of here. - We need you. - [grunts] I got you. Come on! Get the hell in here! Quick! Put him over here. Put him over here. Put him over here. Sorry 'bout the mess, man. I was about to clean this shit up. - [coughing] - Put him right here. [breathes heavily] - Bullet hit him under his armpit. - [coughs] - His right armpit. - His other right armpit, Clarence! - Where the fucking blood is! - Would you just chill out, man?! You got me so fucking rattled, I can't even think straight! I got this. Just let me do my thing! [woman] Clarence! Who's that? - Who the fuck is that? - [woman] Who you got in there? Ma! It's the pie guy. He's just droppin' off a pepperoni. [woman] But I hate pepperoni! Yeah, I know! It's not for you! It's for me. - You said you didn't want any. - [man grunts] - That ain't no pie guy! - Mom, just relax, okay? I'll be there in a bit to rub your feet. - [woman] Really? - I promise, Ma! Just watch your program, and I'll be in there before it's over. [grunts] - Yo, what the fuck are you doin'? - I... I... I need my bag. - What bag? - It's a medical bag. It's green. It's about this big. - This it? - That's it. Toss it here. Now, everybody just give me my space, and let me do my thing. [cell phone vibrates] - It's Bill. - Take it. I got it. - You got this? - Yeah, I got it. Go go go go go. Hey, what's up? What you got? He's down, but it's a shit deal. Thirty cents on the dollar. Fuck, that's seventy percent. I know, but it's one of those take-it-or-leave-it situations. Your call. [suspenseful music plays] - All right. - How's the bleeding? Not good. So how we gonna do this? This dude has lost a shit ton of blood. My guess is the bullet bounced off his shoulders, start gettin' down to his stomach. His abdomen is distended, and he's got a G.I. bleed. I ain't got time for this, Bro. Well, I don't know what to tell you, bro! I'm a corpsman, man, not a surgeon. Without real trauma care, and even then... I don't know! Ain't gonna happen, can't happen. [suspenseful music] You make it go easy for him. Take it! [door opens] What's goin' on? Yeah, it's all good. I... I did my thing. And, uh, he's in rough shape, but the bleeding stopped. He just needs some time to rest. Well, we ain't got time for no rest. You gotta get him fixed up, ASAP. Get him over to Bill's house. He can rest when we get there. - What's Bill have to say? - Got a deal. - Twenty minutes and we will know. You hear me? - Yeah. - Let's move. Let's go. - Yeah. Hey... Thank you. - Yeah, man. - Take care of him. [suspenseful music] Look... as soon as we're done with this, I'm gonna drop you off at St. Charles. You're gonna take the street car home. When are you comin' home? I don't know. - So this is it? - No, it's not it. All right? As soon as the heat dies down, I'mma send for you and Joan. Jamie... You ain't never gonna send for us. If you make it out of this, and that's... that's a big if... You're gonna be running for the rest of your life. I got a plan. - What plan? - Bolivia... - Let me explain... - Bolivia? - Listen to me. Listen to me. - Jamie, I don't even know... - I don't even know, where the fuck that is, Jamie... - Listen... It's in South America, and there's this big lake down there, Massive. Right on the Bolivian, Peruvian line. Right there on the border, surrounded by the Andes Mountains. And, in the middle of this big lake, there's this little island called Isla de Sol. There's no cars, no roads, Just fishermen and farmers. All right? You, me, and Joan could start a life there. Just the three of us together? Jamie... - I love you. - I love you. - And I'd go anywhere with you. - Yeah. [door closes] [banging on car] You gonna leave him behind? Sup? Fuck it. Let's go get our fucking money, come on. - You Brill? - Who the fuck are you? I'm nobody. Funny, I was just thinking that. Yo, let's just fucking do this, 'aight? Check this shit out. - Good, brother? - Yeah, we good. Yo, homie. You, uh... you're a little light, don't you think? How do you figure? That's five hundred K. - I'm sure it is. - [Brill] That's thirty percent. - Yes, it is. - Yo, that's what we agreed to. What the fuck did you just say? It's the only fucking deal on the table. We didn't have no choice. What, you didn't think you need to run that by me first? [Brill] Do we have a problem? Yeah, we got a fucking problem, hold on. If you about that action, just say the word. Yo, we're good! Aight? Everybody, just calm down. [suspenseful music] You the smart White boy, best get your bitch in line... What the fuck did you just say? You heard what the fuck I said! Yeah, fuck 'em. Come on. All right, okay, All right. No, you're right, it is what it is, - I apologize. - [gunshots] [gunfire] Hey... you... [gurgles, chokes on blood] Come on, you're gonna miss the best part. Yup. There you go. - [gunshot] - What the fuck! [engine revs] Go, go, go, go! - [suspenseful music] - [Ava] Oh, God. I knew it. I fucking knew it. Oh, shit! All right. Get down. [suspenseful music] All right. Don't do anything stupid. Yo, be cool. Mick. [indistinct radio chatter] [indistinct radio chatter] Six, thirty six, C. Drop it to me. [suspenseful music] [siren blares] [sirens blare] Yo, Nussy. Boss. I don't know how to tell you this. - Tell me what? - The meet went ugly. Brill's gone. What you mean "gone"? Gone. White boys executed him. Knocked off everyone. Nah. Not everyone. Nussy. Yo! Wait! Let me explain. Nah, I can't hear nothin'. What?! 'How bout now? Nah, still nothin'. Wait, what? I don't get it. 'Cause if I could hear you, you'd be an apparition. A what? A fucking ghost, nigga. If I could hear you, you'd be a motherfucking ghost. At least that's what you're gonna be when Stitches delivers you to me. So I can feed you to the fucking alligators. Bitch ass nigger. You heard that? Yes, sir. [handcuffs rattle] Look man, I'm tellin' you, I ain't wanna help him. Not one damn bit. But I had no choice. - He put a fucking Glock to my head. - A glock? Yes, sir. Saw it written right on the side. Had a shiny pearl handle grip. It... Oh, yeah? Did it have any engraving in it? You know on that... shiny pearl handle. Yes, sir. Yeah, it did. Had a grim reaper carved in on it. Really? That sound like something you lie about? Then, they put the gun in my mouth, and pulled back the handle. [Nicotra] Wait, they put it in your mouth? I thought you said they put in to your head. Look, he put it to my head, then in my mouth. All right? Then the crazy son of a bitches start arguing about which one's gonna get to pull the trigger. - Holy shit! - Mmm! Put it in your mouth, and pulled it out... Man, I swear for God, can you believe that shit? [Frank] No. No, I don't. Who are you? You ever heard of the Pinocchio effect? The pokey no fect? No, no. [laughs] Pinocchio. You know, the cute wooden puppet that wished he was a real boy? Every time he told a lie, his nose would grow. Man, I told you. I swear for God. What do I have to gain from lying to you? You see, Edwin... Mind I call you Edwin? You see... The Pinocchio effect is when someone's lying, they know they're lying So they're working as hard as they can to convince you, that they ain't. They start babbling, and going on... Start spitting out more details, more words, than necessary. You know, shit like, 'Do you think I'd lie about something like that?' Or, 'What do I have to gain, lying to you all?' Whoa. Wait... what do you think I'm lying about? [Frank] Everything. For one, a Glock's a polymer pistol. It's plastic. You can't add grips to it. Especially no pearl handle ones. And, second, it's a striker fire, hammerless... Which means there's no hammer to pull pack on, dumbass. -[grunts] [Nicotra] What the fuck is wrong with you, you about to have a stroke or something? I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain all this to you. But, I'm gonna give it a go, anyway. What you're unaware of is, earlier this afternoon, those crazy sons of bitches, that you supplied the intel and the boards to, pulled a North Hollywood shootout. They murdered six officers and put another in critical condition. Which makes you an accessory to, at minimum... Six counts of capital murder. Now, you're realizing the gravity of your situation. All right, look. I had no fucking idea, all right? They were supposed to go in on the prowl. Break in the night before. Look, I had no idea they were gonna kill no one, - all right? - I'm sure the state of Louisiana would really appreciate that explanation. Oh, fuck me. Yeah, yeah, that's about right. All right, look, look... What can I do, all right? Tell me, tell me... What can I do? Tell me 'bout your customers. These guys that put you in this hole. Okay, it was, uh, two White dudes. I think they might've been brothers. How'd you come to that conclusion? They kept calling each other bro and shit. What are you, fucking Redman? Who do you know in this city who doesn't call each other bro? It was different than that, all right? Look I just... I feel like they were brothers. All right? - They kind of looked alike. - Okay, okay. This is good. Tell me more about these brothers. All right, uh, they, uh... The younger one was the smart one. Okay? And... and... The older one was the mean one. What made the smarter one smart? He was just... All about business. He wanted to know the details. Very specific about the details. And the mean one? Oh, oh, he was bad news. You know, some wild eyes. He's the type of guy that's lookin' for any excuse to hurt someone. All right? He told me, if I ratted on him, he'd find me, and leave me twitchin' in my own pile of shit. And... he was... very, very specific about the pile of shit. Okay. I believe you. Keep going. Okay... uh... The smart one had a Saint Jude pendant around his neck. And, uh... the mean one had a... Marine corps tattoo. It said Semper Fi, it had writin' on it. What did the tattoo say? It said Semper Fi somethin' on the bottom, - And, then, Sheridan somethin', on top. - Say what? - It said Semper Fi on the bottom. - No no no... the name Oh, uh, Sheridan Raid, or something. I remember 'cause of the tank. Okay? - That mean somethin' to you? - One second... So, should I have lawyer here, or something? Norma, look, I need you to drop everything, and run two names for me. Listen. I understand how and why you built the boards. But, how did you know about the Thursday deposits? How did you know that branch was temping as a headquarter branch? Look, I don't know nothing about no headquarter branch and no Thursday deposit either. Yeah, yeah. Okay, send me that, right now. [cell phone beeps] -This them? -Yeah yeah yeah. Fuck yeah, that's them. Look, that's the mean one, and that's the smart one. Hey, what's that mean, what about... what about me? Man, what the fuck, man, we good? Michael "Mick" Sheridan and Jamie "James" Sheridan. Irish White trash from the Channel. I popped Mick and his younger brother years ago in an agg assault, they damn near killed a guy. The brother walked, but Mick got sent off to Angola for seven years. Both are ex-Marines from the sandbox. All right, get a bulletin to all of our agencies. - And get these photos to the media ASAP. - Copy. - Any word on the bank employees? - Not yet. I'll rattle Jean's cage again, though. Follow up now. - What happened? - Mick happened. That's what the fuck happened. What is she talkin' about? And, Jamie... Why do you have all the money? We had to move. We had to dump it. Do you have any idea who that was? That was Brill Waynes, Nussy's brother. - [whispers] Nussy... - We are so dead. It's okay. We're fine. Yo, we're better than fine. Everybody's share just got a serious fucking bump. Where we at with the island? Hey, the passports, where we at? [Jamie] What's the matter? You're not gonna be happy till we're all dead, anyway, right? - What? - [Jamie] Look, I get it. Mick, you've always wanted a warrior's death. I ain't afraid of dying, bro. Yeah, no, no, we all know. If we do get out of this, we go our separate ways. We're never gonna see each other again. - Bro. - [Jamie] Don't bro me. You ain't thinkin' straight. I've never been more clear in my whole life. Every pile of shit I've ever stepped in is because of you, Mick. Who got you the money for Joan? Who got you outta hell in Providence? How many beatings I took for you from our old man? You owe me. No. After tonight, the debt's paid. Hey... Hey! I'm your fucking brother! What, that don't mean nothin' to you? This is about her, right? You gonna let that fucking bitch come between us? Say that again. What? Bitch? [groans] [door opens] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Bro! Stitches, baby! I was just about to call you! Two local men have been identified as shooters in today's brutal bank robbery. Their names are Michael Sheridan, 41 years of age, and his brother, James Sheridan, 35 years. Both own extensive rap sheets. Both men are former United States Marines. Having served deployments in both Iraq and Afghanistan. The FBI robbery task force unit is said to be closing in on them. As we report to you this evening. All right, so I just got off the line with Jean. Something did pop. One of those bank tellers, that pretty brunette? Ava Rishoto, she grew up in Irish Channel Now, she only had a couple of dings in her sealed juvie record. - Such as? - Petty theft at 13, and a P.I. at 15. Eh, there's more. I told you Jean was digging. So he pulls the bank accounts on all of 'em. And she's got over 75 grand in deposits. Three weeks after they pulled that job in Metairie. - So, you followed the money? - All digital. Something called, uh, Secret Angels. It's one of those anonymous sites where you crowdfund sad stories. Now, all the money did go to pay the hospital bills. And nothing else looks suspicious. She's still carrying her house and her car note. But... those dates matchin' up like that, that just... - makes for one hell of a coincidence. - Hey, Givens! - What you workin'? - You ain't heard? - [Nicotra] Heard what? - Narcotics on the scene. They've got six baggers on the ground in Central City. - Look's like it's Nussy's group. - How do you figure? Your boy Brill is one of 'em. When'd this happen? Shit, the bodies ain't even cold yet. I gotta roll. What's a Brill? Only the little brother to the biggest gangsta in the wards. - [Frank] Really? - Yeah. [Frank] Big enough gangsta to wash one point five mil? [Nicotra] He'll definitely be on the list. Where can we find this Nussy? Well, he's got a club over on Magazine. Show me. - [heavy breathing] - [gun fire] [Ava] Jamie. [rapid gunfire] Jamie... Jamie! - Jamie! - [Mick] Yo, yo! Okay. - Hey... - Jamie! - [Mick] You okay? - Jamie. [Mick] Bro? Hey, yo, yo, you good? You okay? Jamie, fucking, I'm so fucking sorry, bro. Bro. I'm so fucking sorry. I got this, bro. I do. I'm... I'm gonna tell 'em it was me. You just ain't gettin' it, man. No matter what you say, they're just gonna kill us, anyway. [coughs] [coughs] Ava! Hey... I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. [door creaks] Hey, bro. It wasn't them. It was me. It was all me. Is that right? Hey, there's more money than this, A lot more money. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Just let her go. - Yeah, this one? - Yeah, even trade. - Hey, hey... - Come on, man... Hey! Even fuckin' trade, man. A million cash, - I stashed it. - [whimpers] No, it ain't gonna happen. Come on, what the fuck's wrong with you? - It's a million dollars. - No, it ain't. Brill already told me what you left him. That's all you got right there. Plus, my boy Stitches over there... [chuckles] that motherfucker got somethin' wicked for her ass. [chair scrapes against floor] Hold on, princess. Hey, yo, motherfucker, it was me that dumped your little bitch ass brother. Oh, yeah. You should've heard him. Begged me. Whimpered. Cried like a little fucking bitch. Until I jammed that .45 in his mouth. Hey, yo, homie. You know anything about the terminal effects of contact shots? No? That's a big word. You see, with the terminal effects of contact shots, the body body absorbs all the discharge from the round. Not just the fucking bullet. All those gasses... expanding that fucking fast? Whoo! That's some savage, ugly shit, bro. You gotta trust me on this one. Your little brother Brill... That's gonna be a closed casket. [laughs] [exhales] Well, I smell the vapors of hell on you, boy. You good, but you're not gonna play me. No. I'm... I'mma savor the moment. Got plans for you. Take my time. Make it a few nights, even. [laughs] See that container over there? Know y'all been wondering what that is, all night, huh? That's a hundred gallons of sulfuric acid. Turn a man into soup in minutes. Real wicked shit. Yeah, I got that from my Mexican friends. They got it goin' on. [chuckles] Hey, yo, Stitches. Let's show these fools a little demo real quick. Get their fucking mind right. I just want you to know it's about to get real noisy in here. - [bubbling] - Real noisy. No no no no no no. God, god, no, please. Wait, wait. Jamie, Jamie, Jamie. - Jamie, stop him... - Hey, hey, come on, man. Hey! Hey! There's more money... - Jamie, stop him! - Hey, look at me, man. There's more fuckin' money, man. Jamie, stop him! Jamie! Jamie! You don't have to do this! Ah! Ah! Ah! No! No, no! - [screaming] - No! Fuckin' no! - [screaming] - [sizzling] - Ahh! - Take that, motherfucker. Take it. Take it like a champ! [screaming continues] You motherfucker! I'm gonna fucking murder you! That's what I'm talkin' bout! Ooh-whee! - This how you get a party started! - [Ava cries] You're gonna wish you murdered me first. So the Jet tells me, that ya'll are brothers. You the younger brother? Am I wrong? [suspenseful music plays] Hey, Stitches! Let me have a go at it. [Ava hyperventilates] No, Mick, do something, Mick. Do something. Hey, hey! No, no, no, no. No, don't do that! No, no, no! This is what you wanted, huh? Hey, hey, hey, hey! Shut the fuck up! It's okay. It's okay. [suspenseful music] [Ava wails hysterically] Ah! Ah! [glass shatters] [grunting] [grunting] Okay, okay, you... [chemical bubbling] [Nussy gasping] Talk about deja fucking vu. Didn't I tell you, you were gonna wish you killed me first? - [Nussy moaning] - Don't you? - Oh, you're all right. - Come on! We're gonna celebrate. What? Take her, take her and go. Go! Go! Go! [dispatch] All units, we're receiving multiple calls of 94s at 961 St. Mary Street. Callers say, it sounds like automatic gunfire. -That's Nussy's place. Ten minutes away. -Let's go! [engine revs] [sirens blare] [suspenseful music] - [Ava gasps] - [tires screech] - Freeze! - Do what he says. Put the gun down. Put it down! - Not even for me, not for me. - Put the gun down. Come on, man, you don't want to do this! - Think about Joan... - Put it down. - Think about Joan, Jamie. - Don't be stupid! Now! [suspenseful music] That's it! Slowly! Good. Now step back. Let me see your waistband. Pull up your shirt. Put 'em on the ground. Kick 'em to me. [guns clatter] Ma'am, you back up, till I say stop. - Okay. - Do what he says. Back! Back! - Stop! - Uh, yes, sir. You, to your knees! To your knees! - Six, 36, headquarters. - [dispatcher] Six, 36, go ahead. I've got a White male. I'm at the corner of Laurel and Second Street. The subject matches the description of one of the shooters from the BOLO from the bank. - That's blocks away. - Come on Nico, just get us there. Go, just go. You're gonna fry for what you did today, and I'm gonna reserve a front row sea- [Jamie] Wait! What the hell? Why'd you do that, bro? Cause I love you, bro. Look at me, look at me, Jamie, look at me! Hey, hey! - [car approaches rapidly] - Take cover! Babe, we gotta go. Come on, Jamie! Come on! [Frank] Go. Let's go! Runaways, shots fired, suspect fleeing on foot. 1200 block. Be advised, plainclothes officers in pursuit. Let's go! FBI, six, 25. Add us to the search. [sirens in distance] [indistinct chatter] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my... [crowd screaming hysterically] Jamie... Yeah. Come on. [sirens blare] Gonna make the block. Back door! Move! Move! [Nicotra on radio] I'm on Maura, headed to Josephine, I'm almost on you guys. - Clear! - Clear. Go go go! To the gate! What the fuck! Get the fuck out of my house! - FBI! - Move, move! Stay down! He's hit. You got eyes on him? - No, you? - Negative. [pants] I got eyes on him! Nico, ya'll go right! [sirens blare] [suspenseful music] [pants] He's gotta be here somewhere. Gunshot can't be far. - Take left. - All right. Head on a swivel. I've got blood. Fuck. Drop it. Bad move, pal. Back up, back the fuck up! - [sirens blare] - [tires screech] - Drop it, punk! - Drop the gun! - No! - Take the shot, Mike! Take it. Take the shot. Yeah, Mikey, If you got a shot, you should take it. Take it! [suspenseful music] [gunshot] [grunts] Oh, fu... - [Mick groans painfully] - Suspect down, suspect down. Fuck, fuck. Where's your brother? [Mick gasps] He's dead. I... He's fucking dead. [moans] Dead. Officers need an ambulance. [indistinct] [train approaches] Tell Joan how much I love her, okay? Every day. - Every day. - Every day. I'm gonna take care of her. I love you so much. So fucking much. I love you, too, Jamie. I love you. [ambient music plays] [liquid sloshing] - What you lookin' for? - Somebody went in here, tryin' to find ya'll teeth or something I can ID him by before he completely dissolves. I recognize this glob of shit. It's the one I tattooed at the bank. - You sure? - Absolutely. - So that only leaves the brother. - Sir... You guys wanna take a look at this? Mean anything to you? I guess that means he wasn't lying. - How'd that survive? - Silver. Noble metals don't react to sulfuric acid. [ambient music] [knock on door] Good afternoon, Mrs. Rishoto. Do you remember me? - Uh, Special Agent Ross. - Yes! Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Yeah. Oh! I just... I slipped on some water, gettin' out the shower. - [chuckles] Ouch! - Yeah, yeah. Do you mind if I come in? I just have a few follow-up questions for you. - Yeah, Yeah. Sure. - Yeah. Thank you. [toy jingles] What a beautiful baby! Hey, hey! So, how is she doing? I heard that she had a surgery recently. Last spring. She's doin' good. [laughs] Doctors say she's probably gonna be fine. Oh, that's good to hear. A congenital heart disorder... I heard that surgery is very expensive to cover all those costs... We were blessed. We crowdfunded, and a lot of generous people came to our rescue. But you already knew that, didn't you, Special Agent. You just said "we". Wewere blessed? Yeah, that's right. Me and my baby. That was incredibly generous. And the donors? They're all anonymous? Yeah, that's how it works. - People can really surprise you. - And the father? He's not around anymore. He's gone. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't be. Some things just aren't meant to be. You know... I... I have... a little girl, too. Well... not too little anymore. - She's beautiful. - Yeah, I think so, too. But... she has a sadness in her eyes. You see it, too. Yeah, that's on me. You know, her mother and I... were just a really bad match. A bad match that caused my daughter a lot of pain. All I can do now is hope that doesn't scar her too badly. - [toy jingles] - Can I give you a piece of advice? You seem like a smart man, a good man even. But, there's somethin' you ain't figured out yet. - Really? - [laughs] Yeah... My daddy, he spent a lifetime lettin' me down. But it don't matter, 'cause he still my daddy. Every little girl needs one. It's just how it is. Yeah, it might take us a while to figure that out, but we always do. And, really, your job... is simple. Do what you can to own your shit. Try to make up for it. And just wait for her. "Wait"? Yeah. Wait. That's it. Don't ever give up. Is that what your father did? Wait? No. He didn't. You said that the only option you have was to just hope your little girl will be okay. That ain't the way I see it. You could just choose to leave your ex where she should be, in the past. And focus on starting over with your daughter. Hmm. You know... that's really excellent advice. It's been lovely chatting with you, Special Agent Ross. I hope you have a better day. Good luck, Mrs. Rishoto. Hey... Thank you. - How'd that go? - It went. And what about her? Bad guys are dead. All the money's recovered. It's over. Yeah, we could charge her, absolutely ruin her. And her daughter would probably get put in the system. - [cell phone rings] - I'll be in the car. [cell phone rings] [ringing continues] [uplifting music plays] Hi. It's a beautiful day. I've got somebody I want you to meet. Somebody real special. Come on. [uplifting music plays]
