THREE SUMMERS LAST SUMMER - Come on, we're late. - Yes, yes. -Hi! -Hi, J?rgen! We're late ... Brigitte still had to make her hair. And Peter was forever on the toilet. Oh. Hi, Thomas! You've grown, eh? Hi! Welcome! Nice that you Could come. -Hi. Beautiful weather today. -Yes. -Going back to Denmark? -To Denmark? Never! I have no desire to to pay so much in taxes. What do you do? J?rgen is a lawyer. So you help rich Danes abroad avoid taxes, right? Not quite. I only see to it that none of you fucks. - Like the right-wing? - Be quiet. Let's be good. At least he has sense of humor. "Fuck this woman now?" Sounds so disgusting! Let's not talk about politics! We can amuse ourselves. Suits me. Okay, no sex, no politics. What is left then? Flowers, for example. Or ... Love. I'm worried. Let's talk about love. Someone have something to say about this? - More wine? - Yes, please. - Do you hate already have a girlfriend, Thomas? - No. -The girls still fly safely from you. There could be plenty...Nobody is good enough. Don't hurry yourself. Suddenly, you have a wife and children, then it gets boring, You get a divorce,... it costs a lot of money. All for the best. I'm tired. Shall we go, Peter? Sure, let's go. Can I stay and walk Willy? Sure. Willy will be pleased. Okay, do it quietly. Thank you for the evening. - Bye. - Bye, Thomas. - Bye. How's Laura and the kids? Quite good. She doesn't want me to see them. But sometimes I see Marie. She's 14. You're 14, aren't you? Yes. She's a pretty girl. She could be something for you, Thomas. - Can I let him run? - Yes, let him go. Go, run, Willy! - Shall I guess why are you sad? - What? Your parents argue. But this is quite normal. Is that all? That's not it? Then why are you so upset? It's a secret. You can tell me. Then you must tell me a secret as well. I have no Divine Secrets. Why are you sad and pissed off? Okay, agreed. You tell me your secret and I tell you mine. Okay. I'm gay. No, Thomas, not really. Yes, since last Christmas. What, something extra that Santa brought? Yes, I can't help it. You mean you're really serious? How can you be so sure? How many have you been with? Up to now, not with anyone. Then how do you know it's want you want? Girls don't interest me. Okay, that's a reason. Now it's your turn. Okay. I want to separate from my wife. I think she is a stupid cow. You have good laugh, You don't have to live with her. I know it's stupid. We stick together, You and me with the big secrets. Yes, we dirty sneaks. THIS SUMMER Hi! The door is open. Come in! It was a wonderfeal meal. A pity that it was only us to eat it. Why haven't you found a woman? Perhaps J?rgen isn't looking. Probably better off without one. I've tried. J?rgen has test-fucked a dozen, but none have passed. - Where the hell does that come from? - Yes, where the hell, Peter? Huh? He was not like that before he was gay. It hasn't been a dozen, Thomas. But I've done what I could. Something to shoot for! - Shall we watch a DVD? - No, we must go home and unpack. -J?rgen surely wants to go to sleep. -No, I still have a game to watch. Oh. - May I watch it with you? - He doesn't like football. Glad to have him stay. You know what, Thomas? When you get to bed, cover yourself. You know what, Peter? I'm unlikely to escape. Yes, you're so clever. How's it going with the Bolivian, you wrote me about? It was Peruvian. She was okay. She had a giant ass. Are you still together? No. I think I'm too picky. I know. What about your friend? Why didn't he come? We broke up two weeks ago. Well ... He left me. Was there another man? No... not that I know of. What is the wildest time, that you've ever had? During sex, I mean. I should answer this? As you wish. If you're up to it. Okay. I was with two women at the same time. What happened? That is far too disgusting for you. No, tell me! We were drunk ... ... and the three of us were dancing together. We kissed. One was in front of me .... ... and the other behind... ... opened my belt .... ... and then the zipper of my pants. And what happened next? Then she knelt down before me. Wow! it's big! Thomas, what are you doing? Lots... go on. "She knelt down before me..." And then? Well, then ... ... she opened my pants... and pulled out my dick. NEXT SUMMER - Hi! - Hi! Hi! Come in! Hi! Welcome! Come in. Hi.
