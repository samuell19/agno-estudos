Subtitles by explosiveskull What's wrong? Are you okay, honey? - Oh. - You look all tuckered out. I'm fine. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. - I fell asleep. - It's okay, sweetie. It's okay. What time is it? - Hello. - Well, look who's here. I can't stay, but just a minute. - I brought you some chicken. - Aren't you a love? And it's in the casserole dish of yours that I've had for six months. Oh. Hm. - What's this? - I made you some galumpkis. And that's your old casserole dish. I've had it for a year. Isn't that funny? Sit down. I'll pour you some coffee. What are you doing making me food? You're the one with the invalid. Oh, don't I know it. He's been driving me bananas. "Did you call Jerry?" "Did they put the new snowplow on the truck yet?" What are you gripin' about? - How's he doin'? - Well, he's hobblin' around. He wanted to go out and cut the damn wood the other morning. Don't listen to her. - How are you feelin', Al? - Ah, still a little lame. Well, you're probably goin' a little stir-crazy too. He wanted to get on the goddamn tractor the other morning. I says, "What are you tryin' to do? "Throw your other hip out of joint? Get back in that chair." You gotta take it easy, Al. - Just a little bit longer. - Yeah. Listen. How's everything with Brian? Fine. I don't know. Well, we're prayin' for him. Oh, hi. I can only stay a moment. I just wanted to bring by some "Agatha Christies." She was chattering away with her daughter this morning. She usually takes a nap around this time. Yeah. - I think she looks pretty good. - She's a trooper. I'm gonna bring her mom by later this week. - She is a pip, that one. - Yeah. Gets us laughing so hard, we practically wet our pants. She's somethin', alright. Alright, bye. Bye. Thanks for coming. Dorie took the car. No problem. - Here, let me get that. - How's Donna? Well, she was napping, but she looked pretty good. Her levels are all good and she's gettin' her appetite back. John brought her some Friendly's the other day and she just wolfed it right down, so.. Yeah, that's what you want when you're in the hospital. What you loved when you were a kid. Yeah. So how much longer is Bill in town? He's leaving Thursday. Oh, we better get over there tomorrow then. - I'm bringing Mame. - Hm. Good. He asked about her. Um, do you have time to stop by for a coffee? No. I have some errands to run. Thank you. Oh, wait a minute. I know. You don't have to say a thing. Brian? Wake up. Get up. - Mom, what the fuck? - Come on. Get up. What are you doing? You can't lie around and sleep all day. - What are you doing here? - What am I doing here? I'm making sure you're alive, that's what. Yeah, well, I don't know what you think I'm doin' but you can't just show up like this. Look at you. You are filthy and you don't even know what time it is. I told you, I've been sick. Didn't I tell you I've been sick like 90 times? - Yes. That you have bronchitis. - Yeah. Look. Here's the medication to prove it. It takes time. - Brian. - I was cleanin' up before. Brian. Just let me put myself together. Brian, you need to listen to me. You've been saying that you're sick with bronchitis for five weeks now, and I just don't believe you. Well, if you don't believe me, that's your right. I went out at night and I forgot a jacket. But you don't believe me. Sweetie, you've got to go back to the clinic. What? - You think it's that? - Yes. After everything that we have been through. And if you think I could look you in the eye and lie about that? How could you even think that? - Honey... - It just kills me. It kills me because it means that you know, I've lost your trust. It means that you don't trust me even after we talked everything through. Brian. I need you to know how awful it is for me. To think you think that I could ever do that again. - I.. - Please. Please what? Stop doin' something I'm not doing? - What can I say... - Sweetheart... Don't come near me. I don't wanna get you sick. Even if you don't believe me. Oh, what about her? If... If you're sick, why is she here? She's sick too. She's sick, too, mom. Brian. Look at me. You need to go back to the clinic. I just.. I just need you to trust me, please. - Okay. - Thank you! Okay. But take a shower and get cleaned up. I will. And your clothes are in there on that chair. Okay. And please take care of yourself. - Please! - I will. I don't think I'm gonna have a salad. Okay. Oh, my God. There's only one piece of pie left. I'm sorry. My friend got there first. I am sick and goddamn tired of these kids who keep piling food on their plates just because they're kids. I was at the Country Buffet last week and this little shit, he grabs the last pork chop off a pan and he plunks it down next to three cheeseburgers. And his parents say, "Oh, how about that appetite? Ho, ho, ho." And I says, "Yeah, how about those manners?" - That shut 'em up. - Mm-hmm. How's your cousin? Pretty good. Pretty good. Boy, she's had it about as rough as they come. And she's as cheerful as ever. How's Mario's shoulder? He's in a lot of pain. And it serves him right. He won't listen to me. I keep saying, "Why are you lugging that stuff up and down the back steps? Let Dave Milch do it." But no. "I'm gonna carry my own goddamn firewood. Thank you very much." - I was at the Rymanowski's earlier. - Yeah, Al's going through the same thing. He had surgery. He's luggin' this, pickin' up that, carrying this. Yeah, I said, "Mario, what happens if you take a spill "and then it's up to me to waddle out there "and help you off the ice? Yeah, that would put you in a spot, wouldn't it?" Mm-hmm. You heard about Tom McConnell? - Yeah. - Goddamn PCBs. I know it. I can't believe it. Let's see. There was my Dave Dave Goggins, Howard Boyce uh, George Bulgarelli, Mike Gizzy and Bobby Angelo. That's right. All within three years of each other. How about Pete Arlos and the Wittlesey brothers, both of 'em? It's a wonder Mario is alive and kickin'. Yeah. So what else is goin' on? I'm just waiting for the call to start planning the funeral. Listen to me, honey. There hasn't been a time in the last ten years that you haven't gone to pieces over this kid. You know I love him to death, like he's my own. But he's a grown man. Something got ahold of him. He's the only one that can shake it off. I've known him for fucking ten years, Cor.. - What are you doin' here? - I brought you some food. He knows me. It's simple. What? Okay. What the fuck am I supposed to do, huh? Yeah? Why don't you shove it all up your fucking ass along with your faggot partner and your fucking cunt girlfriend? Brian! I just really need that job, mom. - What job? - Uh, uh, bookstore. - Job in a bookstore. - A bookstore? That's what I said twice. What? You just come over to stare at me now? Get some lecture about the clinic, Dr. Dresser. Which is super ironic because.. You know what, forget it. I'm alone. - What do you mean? - No. There's no other way to say that, okay? Alone. I'm all alone. I have no idea what you're talking about. I know. That is the point, mom. I just.. Nobody's ever been able to understand. And God knows you haven't. Did you call your cousin Donna like you said? Do you see? That's a perfect example. That's a perfect example! I'm talking about something here. Right? About me not being understood. And you start talking about something totally different. - So you didn't call her? - Why the fuck would I call her? Because she's in the goddamn hospital with cervical cancer, that's why! Ugh! I forgot. Okay? You told me and I forgot. I'm sorry, I will call her. Can you, please.. Why are you making so much noise up there? Mrs. Basuski, I'm sorry... Brian, I found Chris and he was just... Mom. Oh, hi. I'm Carla. Yes, Carla, we've met many times. So you got the rent? Yeah, I got it. Call your cousin Donna if you have the time. Bye, mom. They're always asking me if I want the TV on and I'm not interested. What the hell do I wanna watch a bunch of commercials for? So not a great night last night, huh? - Uncomfortable. - Really? They were gonna give me morphine. But I said, "The hell you are." Once they start in with that stuff you might as well pick out a nice shroud. Oh, shush. Florence Nightingale was ready with the morphine too. By God, she was itchin' to start right then. Mm, speak of the devil. You know, your color is good. - Your color is good. - She's got a good hand there. Stop it. Better not play any hearts. - Gin. - Well, shit. See? You made me lose my concentration. Oh, mm-hmm. Oh, I'm takin' your mom to Dodd's later. - Good luck with that. - Oh, she's a pip, that one. I know. She's a character, isn't she? - Donna? - Oh. Give me a number, darlin'. - Seven. - Okay. - Oh. - Just hang on. Can you give us a minute? - Alright. Here we go. - Yes, okay. Where are you going? I... I'll just be right outside. She can come right back. She asked me to leave, but I'm not going. - I'll be right back. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Take a breath. Fuck. Mame, Donna's in terrible pain. - Mommy. - That's right, honey. Mom's here. Mom's here. How come you came? Mm. Oh, the poor sweet thing. I wish I could just slip her a pill. Mame. I don't wanna see her all drugged up like that. But the Lord will take care of her. Yep. How did you get to the hospital? Eleanor drove me. Well, how's she doin'? Poor Eleanor's as dumb as a box of rocks but she's always been a good friend to me. So we're off to pay our respects to Bill. Yep. Cheap bastard. Like father, like son. I guess this is the last time I'll ever see him. - Oh, no. He's coming back east. - I mean me, honey. - Oh, Mame. - Oh, nothing to fret about. What? You think we're all gonna live forever? - Hello, everybody. - Sorry. - Hi. - Well, there you are. - Thank you. Oh, to hell, Midge. - Oh. Alright, look, have it your own way. It's not my way. It's a fact. I know you're always right but there's a first time for everything. You just keep hammering away at us. It still doesn't make you righter. I don't have to hammer away at a goddamn thing because I know I am right. Because I was married in '72... And Frankie fell down the well in '71. No, sir. It happened right before my wedding. But the fact is that little boy fell down the well... For Christ's sakes, nobody cares what year it is. I thought it was '68. Ugh, don't answer it. It's a robocall. Yeah. - Hi, Leslie. - Hi, Les. Haven't seen you since Easter. - Yeah. - Oh. Hey, how are you? I get those robocalls same time every goddamn day back home. The last few times, I got on and argued with them. Somebody left a bicycle out in the yard. - You did? - You bet I did. Somebody, get your bicycle and put it on the porch, please. - You argued with a robocall? - Yep. You better zip up. It's cold out there. - I just block on it. - Well, see, I can't do that. You gotta have caller ID. You should just put your number in the Do Not Call Registry. That's that government thing you have to sign up for? - Yep. - Nope. Not for me. Oh, it won't do you any good talking to them. - That's for sure. - Hasn't called me since. Just you wait. They used to come door-to-door. Oh, yeah. Jesus Christ, they would try to sell you anything. - They came on Saturday. - Yeah. Oh, uh, no. They came all week long. Vacuum cleaners, Irish Sweepstakes Bibles, anything. I had an encyclopedia salesman come to my door once. Here we go. Well, pardon me. I just don't want to encourage you with your grandstanding.. Tell me the story, Mame. I wanna hear it. Well, I don't know that I care to. But I guess if anybody wants to they can just hobble out of the room. Come on, Mame, tell. Oh, I was doin' my housework the kids had gone off to school and the doorbell rang. And there was this nice man standin' there. And he says, "Hello, ma'am," and I said, "Hello." "Is the man of the house at home?" "No, he's not." And he says "Well, could I come in and wait for him?" "Sure. Have a seat. I can't entertain you, but you're welcome to wait." Those fellows were very persistent, weren't they? Yeah. So I did my housework and he sat there. And I said, "Can I get you a cup of coffee?" And he said, "Oh, why, yes, that would be lovely." So I gave him a cup of coffee. Then I did my washing, I made the beds. He was a little hungry, so I gave him a sandwich. Oh, my goodness. And it got to be time that the kids started coming home from school. And I walked by and he said "Excuse me, ma'am, but could you tell me exactly when your husband will be home?" And I said, "Well, he hasn't been home for seven years. But you never know, today might be the day." Oh, Mame, I think you made me pee my pants. Alright. Who's staying for dinner? - We are. - I'll have a bite. We gotta go home. - Hey, something's boiling over. - Oh. - Oh! - Oh! Get some butter on that! - Fuck. - That's no good. It just seals it in and keeps cooking the skin. Well, it feels better, so shut up. Diane, how's Brian? He's okay. Thank you for asking. How's your hand? It feels better. Good. I have to tell you.. I want to.. What do you want? I want to give birth to something. I think you need help again. Help. You're not alone, sweetheart. I know. I don't.. ...want to.. What? ...do that. Honey, I think we have to go through it one more time. I'll call Dr. Dresser and... What, honey? Just say it. Can't you leave me be? Excuse me, sweetie, okay, just.. Just rest. Okay? I'll get the tomatoes. I can get some more at the Rymanowski's, too if we need them. Alright. And Barb will come. Great. What about jars? I don't know. Let me have a look. - Okay. - Well, let's see. Ah. Oh, I'd say we're about all set. Oh, hey. You going to join us in our merry canning escapade? Nope. It's great when your kids are there to pitch in. Isn't it? Do you need me to take you to SSI tomorrow? - No, I'll manage. - Okay. Feelin' okay? Yeah. I'm fine. You sure? Yeah. I'm gonna get this show on the road. - What is this? - It's a playlist. That's Chick Corea. Oh, my God. I haven't heard this in ages. - You used to listen to this? - Yeah. I listened to it a lot one summer. Oh. See you later. Here's some more mac and cheese. There you go. Oh. Oh. - Alright, mac and cheese. - Sure. Thank you. Here you go, mac and cheese. Oh. Oh. - Oh. - I'm so sorry. Don't worry about it. I'll clean it right up. - Please go and enjoy your food. - Thank you. Can my son have some more chips? Of course, of course. Do you think I should open up a couple more cans of fruit? Oh, I think we're good. Thanks. They seem to be eating it up tonight. You know these big cans, we never finish them at the end of the night and the food spoils so we won't do it tonight. Alright. I'll see if I can find some more applesauce. Okay. Tom, how you doing? Fine. Just fine. Good to get a hot meal. - You want some mac and cheese? - Thank you. Where's Dorothy tonight? She over at Three Rivers at her cousin's. Well, you give her my best, okay? - I will. - Any prospects? - Seem like it. - Good. Keep your fingers crossed for me. - I'll do that. - We're out. - Hi - Hello. Oh, no! Does anyone know where the breaker box is? - Back here. - Go get some candles. - We're getting them now. - Hold tight, everyone. Brian. Brian, wake up. - Ah! - Wake up. Brian! Brian! Wake up! Oh, my God. Ugh. Fuck! You fucking come around here... I'm calling the hospital. I'm getting you locked up. This is too much! Can't you leave me the fuck alone? - You go live your own life. - No! You're gonna die. You're gonna die in your own filth and shit and vomit! I'd rather die in my own shit than have you come around ragging on me every goddamn day, you cunt! Don't you ever say that to me again! Ah! What the hell are you doing up there? We're gonna have a full house for Christmas again. They're bringing the kids. Oh, God, it's starting to be a chore. You know what I mean? I love them to pieces but, you know, I've got the Christmas tree and then I gotta do the cooking and.. And the grandkids are runnin' around and then I get to be really tired and, and I start snapping at them. But you'd miss them if they didn't come. Yeah, but, you know, I'd like to be in an easy chair lookin' down on 'em. I am just so goddamn sick of it. And I can't stand to hear me or you or anyone else say one more goddamn word about it. - Brian, you mean? - Who else? What was this place before it was Country Buffet? What the hell was it? - Mm, Fine Is Kind. - Fine Is Kind, that's it. God, it was the worse food I ever ate. - Was it? - Yeah. Oh! I don't know why I don't remember that the food was no good. Well, when we get to laughin' and yukkin' it up who gives a damn, anyway? We might as well be lappin' up a bucket of fried sawdust. It wouldn't matter. Well, it's better than this deliciousness. That's right. How is everything tonight? Tremendous. Thank you. Liar. You used to make a promise to yourself and keep it. Yeah. Easy. Well, it's pretty simple, but I know it's not easy. People are always telling me that. It's like telling me to leave a baby on top of a mountaintop to freeze to death. He's no baby. - You've done all you can. - Well, easy for you to say. Every time you go over there, you come back hurt and bullied and beat to a pulp. That's right. And what difference does it make? Who cares? I mean, he's sick. - Oh, my God. - It's a sickness. And if I go over there a million times and come back bullied a million more what difference does it make? It should make a difference to you. You've done all you can, everything you can. It's up to him. Well, like I said, "Easy for you to say." Okay, it's easy for me to say. It's hard for me to lie here and feel my insides getting eaten up and hearing you telling the same old goddamn stories about him again and again and again. I'm probably not getting out of this bed. He can get up and walk away any time. You know what I would love is to never hear another goddamn word about him. Okay, fine. I'm looking forward to that. You're not alone, honey. Hello. Brian? Hello. Oh, no, you don't. Excuse me. Don't listen to a word she says. Have whatever you want. What the hell are you doing? These people didn't come here to be punished. That was his third time... I don't give a shit if it was his 23rd time. You don't do that. Just because you're poor doesn't mean you don't have to follow the rules... Just because you're an idiot doesn't mean you have to open your big fat mouth... Alright, that's enough. I know. You don't have to tell me. Never mind about her. It's you I'm worried about. - I'm fine. - No, stop it. No. I could use some help out here. Yeah. Well, hold one moment, please. I'll be right there. Look, I need to get out there. No, Diane, you need some peace. What would I do without you? - I don't know. - You would be fine, kid. As long as I'm here, you don't need to worry about it. Now I'm going out there. You take the time.. ...get yourself together.. ...and come out when you're good and ready. Okay. Hey, nice to see you. How are you doing? She started talking about how thankful she was that she had 37 years of life and how the Lord had blessed her with a loving husband and two beautiful children and how she was so goddamn lucky. It's your turn. Concentrate. I'm listening to your story. - Well, multitask. - Okay, okay, okay. So everybody in the room is sitting there smiling and whatnot, and the therapist is smiling. And... I raised my hand and I said, "Excuse me. "But while you're so busy being so thankful "do you think that if the Lord came to you and offered you "another month or two, you wouldn't take him up on it? "I don't feel so goddamn lucky and thankful and blessed. I feel like I got the short end of the stick "and I feel sick. And so do you, for Christ's sake." Well, that's tellin' 'em. Yeah, that was pretty much the end of the session. Yeah. I mean, excuse me but bullshit. Well, excuse me but gin. Oh, my God. That's the old pro I remember. - Back in the groove. - Played the summer of '99. Was that the year we played gin all summer long? Yes. That was.. No, that was '98. '99.. '99 was a different kind of summer. Well, I was unstoppable in '98. You were pretty unstoppable in '99 too. Well, sh.. What was the point? - Oh, you brought it up. - No, I did not. You just wanna make me feel ashamed all over again. Oh, forget it. I brought it up by mistake. Jesus Christ. I don't have the energy to fight. Especially about an old boyfriend I didn't even particularly like. So I'm guessing that's why you keep starting fights and then saying you don't have the energy to fight 'em. Well, you've got a hell of a nerve. Shh. When are you gonna let me off the hook, huh? - I did. A long time ago. - No. It just comes back to me sometimes, that's all. You say you did, but you didn't and then you keep bringing it up every time you wanna needle me and it works every goddamn time. And then you say, "Don't come around here and fight with me because I've got cancer." Oh, that's great. Thank you for coming around and perking me up. You have been hanging this over my head for years and I just wanna know for once and for all do you forgive me or not? Of course, I do. Then why bring up the Cape at all? I didn't. You did. And sometimes it gets to me. Well, if it gets to you, then.. I mean, you haven't really forgiven me, have you? I forgave you, but I haven't forgotten. And once in a blue moon I remember how shitty it felt to take care of your son while you took off with my boyfriend. Jackie, I only have a minute today but I just wanted to see how Donna was doing. She's doing pretty well today. - Good, okay. - You look a little worn out. Do you wanna go sit with your cousin for a minute? No, I gotta get going. You came all the way up here and you don't wanna see her? You know what, I... I don't wanna bother her today but thank you. Are you sure you're okay? I don't know where my son is. I can't find my son. - What can I get you? - Um.. I'll have a margarita, no salt and, um, some chips. Oh, do you have those crackers that you used to have? Sure, we'll find you something. Okay, thanks. - Everything okay? - It's fine. I'm gonna have another one. - Think you've had enough? - Nope. I want another one, please. That's it for tonight. You're cutting me off? I was a regular here. I remember you, Diane. You gotta go now. Really? Forget it. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm sorry. - Okay, old girl. - Her car's over here. Here we go. Yeah! - Come on. - Here we go. Here we go. - Midge. - You ladies okay? That's alright. We'll manage. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's had a tough time lately. Y'all have a good night. In you go. There. Where the hell are the things for the mirrors? Jesus H. Christ, be careful! I don't know where he is, and I fought with Donna and it was so stupid. I don't know why I did that. No, no, no. It's okay, honey. Would you stop bumping my back with your knees? I am doing the best I can. She really is so hard on herself. Yes, she is. Here we go. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. - George. - George, be careful with her. - Sure. Uh, let me.. Here we go. - And... okay. Okay. - Oh! - Whoo! - Just lie back. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna get a washcloth. - I'm sorry, Mame. - Oh! Oh, don't you worry, honey. With what you're going through, I would have been surprised if you didn't come a little undone. - I'm sorry. - That's enough of that. Here we go. - George, thank you. - Oh, that's good. - George. - Yeah. Get her something to drink. Sweetie, if you feel sick, there's a bucket right here. - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. - Okay. Here we go. - Oh. - Oh, what a nice surprise. - How you doin'? I'm okay. Is your mom home? She went out to do the shopping. - How are you doing? - We're getting by day by day. - Look at you. - I thought I heard Diane. - You're all healed up. - He's got a long way to go. You look like you could do the high jump. But he's got a long way to go. Don't you, dad? I'm dropping these keys off for Carol and I wanted to give her this. - Tell her that's for the.. - I'll make sure she gets 'em. - He'll forget. - Okay. - Well, I... I gotta run, so.. - I'll show you out. - Here. Let me help you down. - No, no. Oh, sorry. Excuse me. Oh. Hello? Dot? Oh, no. Okay, I'll be right there. - Your boy? - No, my cousin. Thank you for calling. I'm so sorry. Hi, Mame. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Oh. I'll just, I'll just turn this right off. I... I apologize. Oh, my God. I... I'll be right back. Brian? Where are you? Where? Well, just wait for me. I'll be there. Okay. Alright. Bye. She loved you. She loved you. Hi, mom. Sorry, I didn't call. I just needed to do it by myself. Like I told you that time I saw you. Do you remember that? I wasn't really sure what you meant. Can I get you anything? Um, yes, I'll have some coffee, please. Mm-hmm. More coffee? Uh, yes, please, and a water. They got the all-day breakfast. Hungry. Looks good. How do you feel? I'm alright. I don't really remember the first few days but they told me it was pretty rough. I'm at a place out on the Cape. This time's different. I can see that. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Be right back with your water. I just feel kind of raw, you know. They just told me that my nerves are wakin' up, so, uh.. It's like sometimes the air hurts, you know. I guess I need to tell you something. What? You know what? I'm gonna tell you another time. Just tell me now. Nope. Another time. Okay. Got a sweet tooth now. So I said, "Listen, are you in high school?" "No, what do you mean?" he says. I said, "I thought so. You look older than that. "So you take me to a real restaurant or you drive me straight home." What did you wind up doin'? He took me to that Indian restaurant up on North Street. - Was that good? - It's alright, but.. I mean, you know, a guy asks you out you get all dressed up and he takes you to a diner? What am I gonna drink? A milkshake? I don't think you've ever gotten your nails done before. I decided to take you up on your special offer. Mm-hmm. And what color are you thinking? I like that light pink one. Angel's Whisper. Nice. And what are we doing with the hair? I think just a trim. So how's the family? Well, my Aunt Ina is the last of the aunts and uncles and she's got emphysema and smokes like a chimney but she's hanging in there. I just can't believe they all went so fast. I lost my favorite aunt last year. - I'm sorry. - I loved her the best. Yeah. I loved all my aunts too. They weren't that much older than I am. My mother was the eldest and had a lot of younger sisters. She was born in a log cabin on the Canadian border. - Is that so? - Yeah. Well, you know, when we're kids we think everybody's gonna live forever. That's true. Oh, your son. His wife, what's her name? - Tally. - Tally. Interesting name. - She gets her hair styled here. - I know. - She is quite the churchgoer. - They both are. She gave me this whole story about how they met at the AA meeting. Yep. She loves that story. It's not a family funeral you're getting ready for? No, no. It's, it's.. It was a close friend. She loved getting her nails done. ...and come to a state of peace. And, Lord, grant her the knowledge and the wisdom to stand in Your light and accept Your Word in her heart and mind that she may come together with us in the joy of worshiping You and Your only begotten son, Jesus. Lord, show her the path to salvation through the grace of Your begotten Son Jesus Christ. Amen. - Hey, mom. - Oh, hi. - Hi. - My hands are wet. - Oh, that's okay. - Hi. - Hi, Tally. - How are you? - I'm good, thank you. - Oh, we're so glad you're here. Thank you, Tally. Okay, good. - Well.. - What can I do to help? You can put some water on to boil. Okay. Look, is that a cardinal? Oh, Lord, I praise You for granting me the sight of one of Your most beautiful creatures. Amen. Praise Him. - See that, mom? - No, I missed it. Lord, we thank You for the bounty of this wonderful meal.. ...for bringing us all together on this beautiful day to share this food. We ask that You bless this meal, O Lord. We pray that each and everyone of us at this table sees the light of divine revelation. Thank you, O Lord. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Well, we've been wanting to get you two together for some time Diane and Diana. - It's very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. We're praying for you. Diane, not Diana. We pray for you too. Yes, I heard you. Thank you. You want some vegetables? Well, you're welcome to join us in prayer anytime, mom. Thank you. You know, we were praying that you'd join our church. Well, we've been through this before and I'll say it again. I'm really happy with my own church. - Mm-hmm. - Thanks. But you haven't been saved. How do you know, Brian? Have you? I think I have been saved, yes. I'm good with my church and with God. But I really don't want you all to keep doing this to me. Just leave me alone about it. - Okay? - Can't do it. All I want is to come over here and have a nice meal and a nice visit. And every single time, you start nagging at me. Well, it may feel like nagging, mom but it's called love. Well, I want you to drop it because it's making me angry. Well, you didn't drop it when I was taking drugs. Salt and pepper. You refused to drop it. You kept coming back no matter how many times I told you not to, right? Well, I'm your mother, so I'm gonna keep comin' around. Not every mother would have done that, mom. My mother left me out in the cold and locked the door behind her. I'm sorry about your mother but please don't compare what I did to this. This is love, mom. It's perfect love. That's what this is. You don't give up. Love doesn't make a person feel upset and angry. This is a gift we're giving you, mom. You remember how it was with me before. I was walking through life with my eyes closed. - Please don't preach to me. - I'm not preaching to you. I'm testifying. To you. To anyone. Alright. You're my mother. I want you to feel the same freedom that I feel. I want you to have the gift of revelation. Revelation. It was like a weight was lifted from my shoulders, mom. I want you to have that. I want the beauty for you. I want the... Please stop being so goddamn selfish for once in your life... Selfish? Please don't take His name in vain. Yes, you heard me. Selfish. How many times did you go visit your cousin in the hospital, huh? None. That's how many. You know how it was with me then, mom, better than anybody. Yes, I know how it was and I know you're as selfish now as you were then. You two just keep coming at me constantly. We just want you to see what we see. - I see with my own eyes. - We know that, mom. - We just wanted you to receive. - Please just stop it. - Leave me alone. - We can't. It's selfishness, pure and simple. You better stop talking to me about selfishness. Well, I guess I won't. You took your own sweet time. You went off to God-knows-where. Please don't take His name in vain. - Shut up. - Hey! Don't you talk to our friend that way. I will talk to her any way I want as long as you all keep badgering me. Where were you, huh? You had to do it your way. Fine. Meanwhile, I am sick, worrying getting myself ready to hear the news that you're dead. And then bang, there you are. And I can't even be in the room with my own cousin when she's passing away. Your cousin. Because that's the time you picked to call. You mean the cousin you left me alone with when you took off with her boyfriend, mom? That cousin? Yes, that cousin. I wouldn't wanna bear that guilt either for that selfishness! But you seem to be able to handle it just fine. You might wanna justify yourself and start getting right with God. I am perfectly right with God and stop simpering! The whole family is a bunch of Bible-thumpers from way back. It's because we were raised in the backwoods. The preachers would come around when we were kids with the tents and the torches and the camp meetings. I always kept that part of my life all to myself. I mean, why in the hell would I wanna share that with anybody? Your mother was the same way. That's why we got along so well. But I remember when she got all excited about the Jews for Jesus. I remember that. - I remember that. - Yeah. "Ina," she said, "did you hear about this wonderful organization called Jews for Jesus?" "No," I says, "and I don't care to." And she got all huffy about that, let me tell you. But she was more like me than Midgy. Or... Mary. - Mm-hmm. - Near the end. My friend, Maxine, was going on about the Lord this and the Lord that about ten years or so ago. But she was a drunkard. Pure and simple from the time Buzz left her. It's the same as Brian. You substitute the one for the other. Yeah. And I took her aside and I told her gently. But I believe it helped her. I figured it was better to have her ravin' about Jesus than doing herself in. And she did come around. - Really? - Yes. And he will too. - There you go. - Thank you. Goodnight, Diane. Damn it. Oh, my.. Oh, Tom, no. I don't want you to be doing this. Can't you let me help you? No, it's not right. Tom, what are you doing? Have a seat, my friend. Okay. - How's Dorothy? - Just fine. I'm sorry, Tom. I don't see why you feel like you have to apologize. Because I don't want you to be working. Isn't it enough that I told you I wanted to help you? I guess so. My aunt was like that. She apologized for eating. She apologized for puttin' one foot in front of the other. She apologized for breathin' up too much air in the room. She thought she had terrible sins to make up for. What exactly, I can't say. Didn't you use to work in a kitchen? I was a short-order cook. Then I worked at the mess hall in, in Westover before I got the job at Land Appliance Plant. That's where I met your husband. I remember. Hmm. Now you got me thinking about my aunt. That woman wrapped herself in shame. I know something about that. Done some damage in my life. Hm. Well.. You know, when I come here for a meal I feel pretty low about myself, my situation. But when you serve me Diane, I feel sanctified. Goodnight. - Sorry. - Geez. Sorry. So you staying late here? Oh, yes. - Come on in. - Come in. Come on in. It's good to see you. Wow. Am I supposed to be doing somethin'? No, no, you don't need to do anything. Mm, smells sweet. Okay, ready? Mm-hmm. Ah. Ah. Now open your eyes. - Brian? - Hey, Diane. Come in. Come in. Come in. I can only stay for a minute, okay? How are you doing? Yeah, not bad. I just went for a walk out in the woods to our old spot. Looking up at the stars. - Does Tally know you're here? - No. Had to sneak off to see my mom. Are you supposed to be drinking? Nope, but fuck it. Oh, good gracious. What is gonna become of you? I'm alright. I tried to call you a few times, but... I know. I know. I was angry and.. ...ashamed. Both, I suppose. Well, I just wanna say I'm sorry. For the dinner, for.. ...everything I put you through, you know. Well.. ...we both have a lot to be sorry for. I don't blame you. You should have walked out of there as soon as we started preyin' on you, you know. Well, my behavior was just as bad. But that's not what I'm talkin' about. I meant the Cape. And I know I've said it before, but I wanna say it again. - I'm sorry. - Uh, okay. Look, that's why I was trying to call you. Um, there's something I need to say to you about that. I wasn't angry at you. I mean, I was, but I wasn't, you know. No. It's like I was supposed to be angry, so I was. Ah. You took off, right, and the cousins freak out and... and Donna went bat-shit and I... I don't know. I don't know. It was confusing. But I was thinking about you the other day and how happy you were with Jess and, and how amazing that could have been. You remember his name? Yes, of course, I remember his name. I loved that guy. But I cheated on your father with him... Can you just forget about that for one minute, please? - I did love your father. - I know, mom. I know. I did too. We're not talkin' about that right now. I'm, I'm trying to say that I, I taught myself to disapprove of you. Okay. I've used that against you. The next time I beat you over the head with it and I probably will.. ...just remember what I'm sayin' now, okay? Okay. Okay. It's the gift of revelation. I gotta get back to Jesus world now. Goodnight, Diane. Goodnight. Wait. Did I forget to turn the burner off? I know I had set the oven on 400, but.. ...there was someone.. Wait, I need to find my place. Did I forget to turn the burner off? I picked up the prescriptions and the vanilla extract and the cloves.. I lost my place. And the ribbons. And three teaspoons of orange rind. And I rubbed the skillet with bacon, but.. I picked up the prescriptions and the vanilla extract. Wait, there was someone. I set the stove.. They called everybody to come inside before dark and warm up in the kitchen.. I remember the orange rind and the ribbons and the bacon, but.. Did I forget to turn the burner off? Wasn't there someone who never came inside when I called for him? Did I forget to turn off the burner? But I set the stove at 400, but.. There was one more thing. Wait. There was something.. Mrs. Rhodes, are you okay? Precious. Oh, my God, Mrs. Rhodes. Someone. Hang on. Precious. Subtitles by explosiveskull
