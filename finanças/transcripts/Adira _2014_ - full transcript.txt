- Our lives are much like trees. They don't propel forward in linear pattern, but rather grow in different directions, like the roots of a great tree. Everything can be found in that tree, our family, our memories, our struggles. Everything connected. - Come darling. - Move, quickly! Be strong. - I love you darling. - Is there something you want to tell me? Where is the little girl? Don't worry, we will find her soon enough. A Jew-lover is worse than a Jew. - As soon as we stop, I want you to get out and run. - The house is ready for them with enough supplies to last a few days. - We will be sure to move them in time. Thank you, for everything. - Anything that we can do to help. Excuse me. - You see this? It's a good luck charm. Take it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Good to see you, Mr. Ackerman. - Thank you, professor. - I take it your travels went well? - Yes, everything went as planned. But I must warn you, there are rumors of a new checkpoint near the farm. - Will that be a problem? - It shouldn't be. We can always take the long route. We are running out of time. We need to get as many of them away as we can. - I understand. Please be careful. Shalom. Don't worry darling, they will be safe. - But what about us poppa? - Well they will eventually come after us. But we are going to keep you safe. You have to stay strong. Hm? - Now, remember what I told you, when the truck stops you run for it and never look back, then head east until you reach a creek. - And then take a look at my compass and head north. Once I reach a clearing I will be on Grandpapa's land. I know, Poppa. - Oh my sweet Adira, beautiful and strong like your mother. I need you to listen to me. Our brothers and sisters will find you when it is safe, and we will be reunited. If not in this life, then in the holy land. And I love you so much. - I love you too Poppa. I am not worthy of their sacrifice. Their blood forever on my hands. I could feel them. The many displaced families and children that passed through here, that found refuge here. How much longer do you think it'll be? I'm not sure, but I'd say about a week. I guess that's not that bad. No I wouldn't say it is. So, what do you want to do now? I'm kind of hungry, aren't you? A little bit. Do you want some cheese? Sure. This isn't so bad! I can feel you all around me. In the breeze, the sun, like the warmth of your embraces. It's been a week, and still no one has come for me. How much longer will I have to wait? The days blur together like a dream, or a nightmare. I can't wake up. Momma, Poppa. Yeah! Yeah! I see everything in a new light. Like it could quench my hunger. I want to go back to you. Let me go back. Out here, I appreciate so much more. The creek, the breeze, the warm sun on my face, the welcome security of the memorized words from my books. I am grateful for these little things. Here goat! Tsk, tsk. I won't hurt you! Move. Move. Move. Move! Momma, poppa. I carry you with me wherever I go. Even though the weight is heavy on my heart. I am thinking of you always. Sometimes I wander, in hopes of forever being lost. No one has come for me, and I feel glad. I am afraid my will to live has escaped me. I thought I would go peacefully in a dream. But something always brought me back. Hello? Hello? I discovered another house, about a day's journey West. Abandoned, yet full of past life and treasures. I helped myself. * With someone like you * A pal good and true * I'd like to leave it all behind * And go and find * A place that's known * To God alone * Just a spot * We could call our own * We'll find perfect peace * Where joys never cease * Somewhere beneath the starry skies * We'll build a sweet little nest * Somewhere in the - I don't mean you any harm. I just need some shelter for a few days. I saw the fire. I have food and drink to share. Consider it a peace offering. Well, hold on now. My name is Eric. How long have you been hiding here? I was part of the 35th para-platoon in the English army. We landed 5 weeks ago, into a trap. I unfortunately landed in a tree and watched as my platoon was taken by the Nazis. They shot down the majority of us, and captured the rest. I'm on my way here. There is a port here that is selling a boat ride to Sweden to the highest bidder. Sweden has, for the most part, remained neutral in this bloody war and people like you and me can find refuge there. This here is going to win me the boat ride. Where are you going? - We wandered for hours. His heavy steps scaring everything away, but it was comforting. For so long I have wandered these woods by myself. And now, I carried the burden of being with someone. - So, you don't say much, do ya? You know, I always enjoyed a good gag as a boy. You see, the unsuspecting prey would trip on the thread. Huh? It's also useful in alerting you of danger. I'll tell you what. Let me treat you to dinner tonight. It's the least I can do for having so dreadfully imposed on you. - Okay, but on one condition. We race there! - Is that your mum and dad? What's your story? - My parents and I came from England to Germany when they heard our relatives were being persecuted by the Nazis. - Jewish? - My father fell in love with my mother and he converted to Judaism to be with her. Using his family name Irvin, we arrived here undetected. But it wasn't enough to be near our family, my parents felt the calling to be a part of the resistance. They could no longer stand by while friends and neighbors were being attacked or taken away, so they began to harbor refugees from all over. Our home was the last stop on their journey to freedom. It wasn't long before the Gestapo found out and arrested my parents. That was three years ago. I am now waiting for the resistance members to rescue me when it's safe, then I will be reunited with my parents. - Do you think they will ever come for you? - I'm not sure, but my memories and the hope of being with my family are all I have left. I fear that if I leave, I give up on my family. - You are very brave. What is your name? - Adira. - What's going on? - Momma. - Come darling! - Move quickly! - Hey. Do you want some bread? What happened? You ran out of here like a bat out of hell. - I though the wait was finally over. I thought they finally came for me. I hate them. I hate what the Nazis are doing! - I'll drink to that. Hold on now, take it easy, you're no heavyweight. I hope this isn't because of my heavyweight comment. - I saw a Nazi soldier kill two people execution style. Like he was putting down two pitiful dogs. - Sh, sh, sh. Come here. It's okay. You're not alone anymore. Look, there are things in this world that we will never comprehend. Something the matter? - Sh. - We have to get out of here, it's not safe. - But they might see you if you leave now! - Fine, we leave at midnight. I can help you get far enough away from danger. - I can't. I must stay and wait or I will miss the resistance. - Adira, that is just foolish. Look, the resistance is not coming for you. It's been three years. Look, I didn't tell you this before but there is a bloody massacre raging out there! After I cut myself down from the tree, I followed the Nazis to a nearby labor camp where I watched my brothers join the ranks of emaciated corpses. - I'm sure it was just a special prison for enemies. - You're wrong! I sat by and watched small children and elder folk waiting to go into gas chambers. The bodies stacked on top of each other like fire logs along the camp! Once I tortured myself enough, I headed east where I met a fellow whose platoon had been shot down instantly upon climbing a hill. No survivors, except him. It's times like this I wonder why The Lord almighty himself doesn't come down and serve justice. Look, your family is probably dead! I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. - Don't. - Stop! - Adira, run! - Will you come with me? I can help you find your family. You don't have to be alone anymore. - I never stopped searching for you. Even when my life became full of special moments and I was inundated with a loving growing family. The void was still there, the overwhelming wonderment of how and why we couldn't be together again. You are here now. But then again, you always were. I'm coming home.
