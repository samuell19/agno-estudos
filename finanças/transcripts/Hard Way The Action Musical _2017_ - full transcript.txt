There is no love left in this world. No honesty. No justice. People who do good, who follow their hearts, get punished. While others, who have no heart at all, get away with anything. And that's because of people like you. We are the "Children". And today we'll make this world ... ... a better place. Delta Five for Alpha One, we need backup! Now! Goddamnit, where are you, Robin? We'll be on site in three. Hold your position. Jake. Don't make a move. Woah! Yeah, OK! Copy that! Jake. We need to talk. What, now? Really? We're kind of in a situation here, buddy. I know. That's exactly why. Because later on we might be dead. It's now or never. What are you talking about? We're best friends, you know that. I'm just gonna say it. Jake. I ... I lo ... This is ... er ... You know what? Fuck backup, right? One more step and I will ... Come on. Let's get you outta here. Zach? We're done here, I got him. Come on, Zach! Let's get outta ... Give me the senator. No! Zach! No! Give me the senator. Please. Please don't make me do this. Zach! You know I can't give him up. Fuck! I'm sorry. Jake. Jake is gone. It's just you and me now. Who are you? I'm "The Mother" Four, three - Team Blue in position - two, one, go! Jake. What? We're gonna get "The Mother" today. I promise. But we gotta look out for each other. We're a team. OK? Sure, Robin.

I don't know. Simon just rhymed "right now" with "right now". So what? That's such a poor rhyme. Same words. Is that even a rhyme? Tyler would have known. You're the captain, Robin. It's your call. Right. Let's check the roof. But everybody be careful. I have a bad feeling about this. Don´t worry, I got your back. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Fuck! Jake! - Simon! Where's the fucking chopper? I got you! I got you! Guys! The door! Cover me! No, no, no, no, no! Fuck! Jake! Don't! Stay down! I ain't got time to bleed. Right. Alpha One for B.E.A.T. team leader. We need backup! I repeat: We need backup on the roof! Now! Alpha One! You're there?! We ain't getting any backup, ya'll. It's a trap. This whole mission is a trap. Fuck! What's our next move, Robin? It doesn't matter! They know every move we make. Every step we take. Jake! What would you do? I would go out there all at once from two sides ... ... so he's gonna be confused. And then ... ... then we're gonna end this fucker. As a team. Good. So. We're gonna do this? No. We're doing the exact opposite. Hi Emily. Nice to meet you. I know you wanna kill us.

You distracted him and I took the shot, right? He was singing, Jake. - So? You don't shoot somebody who's singing or dancing. Everybody knows that, even "The Children" know that. But you don't. You just don't give a fuck. For anything. For anyone. You don't care for Tyler, for Simon, for Thomas. You don't care for me. But you know what? I love you. And honestly I hate myself for it. Because I don't wanna love somebody who is heartless like you. Wait. You love me? No! No, no, no! Robin! No! No! Come on! Goddamnit! Hey, hey, it´s good. It's OK. I ain't got time to bleed. No, no, no, please ... Come on, come ... Nooooooooooooooooooooooo! Let's end this. Wait. I got a better idea. Let's take the short cut. Are we gonna dance now? Oh. Man. I just love blowing shit up. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. How the hell did you know, what they´re gonna say? Well. There's a grenade for everything, ain't there? What if they asked something different like ... ... "What time is it?" Well that's a stupid question, ain't it? Why would somebody ask what time it is, huh? Why? You said, there's a grenade for everything. Oh, there is. Pure genius. Nah, just prepared. Still. Prepared for shit like this? I'm gonna let you in on a little secret ... Someone's watching us. Randy! Randy! Come on! Oh God, Randy. No ... Jake? Promise me something. Anything, buddy, anything. Kill all the "Children" for me. What? That sounds so wrong, but yeah, I will. There's no one left to kill, I'm afraid. It's only you and me now. Where are you? Wrong question. Jake. It should be: ... ... "Who are you?" Zach? What happened to you, Zach? I became who I am. Who I've always been. You became "The Mother"? That's right, Jake. The old mother died shortly after we met, so I took over. I wanted them to call me "The Father" ... ... but that doesn't really work in a matriarchy. But why, Zach? Why? I don't understand! Because of you, Jake! It's all because of you. You hurt me. And now I'm gonna hurt you back. Come on, Zach. Let's just talk about it. OK? Talk? Now you wanna talk? Last time I wanted to talk you got me killed. Remember? Zach, there was nothing I could have done. I didn't wanna leave you! Yet you did. You left me to die, ... ... just because you didn't wanna hear what I had to say to you. You'd rather betray me than face me. That's so fucking sad. You obviously have no heart. And nobody without a heart ... ... should live. Oh, come on. What a fucking cliché. That's not possible. What are you doing?! - I don't care anymore! You can kill me. But before you do it, I want you to know that you were right about everything. Except that I ... Except that you what, Jake?! Except I didn't betray you! I betrayed myself!
