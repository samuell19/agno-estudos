"What is my state, O Lord" "What was my offense, what was my fault" Can't you see? - Hurry up, Banarasi. - Here. I've prepared a special stuff. - That too for free. - Free? What are you saying, Banarasi? - You won't even give your shadow to anyone for free. - Why? Even we work so hard for you. We have made 90-100 customers till now. If this continues, the number will come up to:200-400 very soon. And we have send our boys to every school and colleges. They will make friends with simple and innocent girls and boys... and compel them to take drugs. And listen, Banasari. One can never give up this addiction. This addiction is spreading like wild fire in schools and colleges. And we are minting money. Hey, out with the money. Let's go. Out with the money. Money! Take the money. Hey Banarasi, out with the money. I've heard that your business does very well. How much do you earn daily? Come on, out with the cash. Sonia Madam took away all the money. Women don't bully. Instead they sell liquor in the bar. Hereafter whatever you earn, it will be for Rajan Bhai. Or else I will beat you here, and the sound will be heard ... in the Parliament. Catch her! O my God! The face is so sweet and innocent. And good at fighting! 0 God! Hey, run! All ran away. Or else Sonia hits here, and the body falls in the crematory. Looks like Queen Laxmibai come out from the pages of history. "I promise ..." "It's a promise" "I want to live nor die, nothing I want to do..." "... without you" "You are my love, you are my worship" "I don't dream of anyone else but you" "I am crazy about your style" "You reside in my heart" "I want to sleep nor wake up, not walk or wait" "I want to gain nor lose" "Want to smile nor cry" "... without you" "I promise" "It's a promise" "Wish this bond of hearts never breaks" "Wish we never part even after death" "I've asked for you in every pray" "You are in my thoughts..." "You are in my eyes" "I want to go nor come, don't wish to meet anyone" "I want to hear nor say..." "Don't want to weave dreams..." "... without you" "I promise..." - Give me a samosa. - Hey, please wait. - Hey, give me a vada pav. - Please wait. Why are you being hasty? Brother, please give me a vada pav. What do you want? Please wait. - Please give me. - Just two minutes. - Hurry up. - Take this. Which sauce would you like? - Pardon? - Which sauce would you like? - I didn't get you. - Sweet or hot sauce? Both. Here. What do you want? Brother, this is absolutely cold. I just got it fried. If you it too hot, you'll burn your mouth. Sit there and eat. - Give a samosa. - Okay. - What do you want? - Give me a vada pav. Here. And you, sir? Brother, can I get a glass of water? Why? Are you my son-in-law that you are asking for water? There's the water tank. Go and drink water. God knows where these fools come from. Hey, give the money. I already gave the money. He says that he gave the money. Will I build a shopping center with the Rs.10?! Give the money. Brother, I am telling the truth. I swear on the holy Ganges. You did not give the money. And you are arguing? Wonder why do you jobless people leave your house and come to Mumbai. What's going on? One turns out to be a milkman. The other turns out to be a newspaper boy. You all have turned our Mumbai into an orphanage. Out with the money. I told you that I've given the money. You scoundrel, you're lying?! Give the money! What are you doing, brother? Will you kill him? His eyes say that he is telling the truth Mister, I am not a poet to read his eyes. I am a businessman. Brother,if one tells lies by yelling loudly, even that sounds true. Here's your money. But try to control your anger. - Hey Bhaiyya! -He is right. Keep the money in your pocket and your anger under control. Actually this is anger which makes brothers fight. All the wars in the world are because of anger. If you want peace and harmony in the world... then keep your anger under control. Everything will be fine. - You want peace in the world, right? - Yes. Come, son. Now go. -So you are new in this city? - Yes. Even my friend Shekhar lives in this city. - Do you have the address? - No. Searching for someone in this city without an address ... is like searching for a hair on a bald man's head. But my friend is very rich. Everybody knows him in Mumbai. How rich? Even if you sell all the houses in your village, ... you want get one flat in this building. Do you see that building? Each flat costs Rs.10 crores. Flat worth Rs.10 crores, interiors worth Rs. 8 crores. There is more of glamor and less relationships. Now where will you find relationships in this world of glamor. This means I will not find my friend? You will find him if you are lucky. There's an area called Jogeshwari. Lot of North Indians live there. Try your lucky. You will get a bus to Jogeshwari from there. You will reach the destination. - Thank you. - See you. What do I do? Where do 1 go? There's no bus since so long. Hey! Hey, can't you see? Raja, you are getting angry without reason. The roads are such that one loses balance sometimes. And as it I am learning to ride a cycle. And accidents do take place while learning. But you have created trouble for me. You very well know that father's BP shoots up seeing me. And after all this, he will kill me today. Look. From tomorrow on you start training me to ride a cycle. Then there won't be any trouble. - Will you teach me? - Stay away from me. Alright, forgive me. I will forgive you. But what about me? - Why? - Father won't forgive me. And all this will happen because of you. What is this, son? How did this sack become half? Why do you commit blunders everyday? Aren't you afraid of your father? Mother, all this happen because of Neha. She was learning to ride a cycle. And she bumped into me. And this is what happened. What is my fault in it? Sit here. Do on thing. Go out for sometime. Your father has taken your grandpa to the doctor. I will try to handle the matter. - Here's your ... - Hey, Shekhar. My friend, have you returned from Mumbai? Come, Raja! Have this sweets. I will. But I've heard that you bought Thakur Sahab's ... 10 acres of orchard soon after returning from Mumbai. You must've heard it right. Or else would I distribute sweets just like that? But my friend, how did all this happen? From where did you get so much money? Come in the corner. Come and sit here with me. Raja, do you remember when teacher used to teach in childhood? That when Jahangir saw Kashmir... he said that "If there's paradise on earth, it is here. And only here." Similarly I'll say. If there's money everywhere in the world, it's only there. This means there's lot of money in Mumbai. It rains money. Now look at me. I've become so rich within no time. You must be having a car too. Not just one. I have lots of cars. Cars cars everywhere. Servants, assistants, bungalow. Ask my address to anybody in Mumbai. He will bring you to me directly. I am that famous in Mumbai. Anyway, forget it. Why are we talking about that? Tell me what is your program me? Now that you are such a famous man in Mumbai. - You must've watched lots of programmes there. - Of course. Today you watch the program me of our village. Nautch girl dance! - Really? -Only fun. "I've come to make you lose your senses" "I will make you lose your senses" "I will reign every heart" "I will set such a trap" "For no reason, don't hit ..." "With the arrows of your glances" "I will lose my senses" "Listen, O beloved" "Forgive me if I commit an offense" "My heart started beating, such is your magic" "If this is what you wish..." "Even I am ready, I swear" "My moods and airs will snatch your peace" "Everybody believes that you are my admirer" "Come into my eyes, in the excitement of love" "Come, I'll hide you in my tresses" "Mesmerizing you are" "You are beauty from head to toe" "Forgive me if I commit an offense" "The passion is going out of control" "If this is what you wish..." "Even I am ready, I swear" "For no reason, don't hit with the arrows of your glances" "I will lose my senses, Listen, O beloved" "What is wrong with me, ever since I touched you" "My soul is restless, intoxicated I feel" "Don't make me suffer like this, give me the potion of love" "Give me the fruit of my desires" "Your style is unique of all" "The world is crazy about your beauty" "Forgive me if I commit an offense" "The passion is going out of control" "If this is what you wish..." "Even I am ready, I swear" What fun! What a performance it was! Raja, I will leave by 8 O'clock train tomorrow. Let me know whenever you come to Mumbai. As long as I lived in the village, I had lot of fun with you. Now I will miss you a lot in Mumbai. What happened? Why aren't you saying anything? I am feeling very sad. When you go away, once again I will become lonely in the village. Whenever you are lonely, assume that I am missing you in Mumbai. It's quite late. I'll take your leave. Give me a hug once. Then wonder when we will meet again. My friend! You have to do a lot of things in life. Don't be weak. Take care. Grandpa! You are still awake? Eyes feel sleepy, son. When a son stays out till midnight... the eyes of his elders are also set outside. Then how can they sleep? I have lots of dreams for you, son. You know, when I used to do farming... sometimes the army trucks used to come on the village streets. And sometimes even a police jeep used to pass from there. People used to salute them. And when people used to salute them, your face used to come ... in front of my eyes. I used to feel that people are saluting you. Raja, will you fulfill my dream before I die? - Will you do it, son? - Yes, grandpa. I will surely fulfill you dream. You will surely see that day... when everybody will salute me. Hey Loafer! Where are you going? How long will you hide from your father's eyes? I am fed up of your behaviour. If the child dies soon after birth, it's one sorrow. If he dies at a young age, double sorrow. And if the child is useless like you... one's sorrow never ends. I will kill you today. I'll whip you. I'll remove your eyes. Tell me where were you all night? Tell me. - What are you doing? Please don't hit him. - Move aside. It would've been if you had remained barren ... instead of giving birth to such a child. No, please don't be angry with him. Then you should've strangled him as soon as he was born. - Please come inside. - Move aside! Tell me where had you been. Are you a father or a beast? If you beat so much he will die. He doesn't even die! I'll mourn if he dies once. But my daily problems will come to an end. If he dies, even I'll die. Father, you have pampered him. You have dreams for him, right? Keep in mind. One day this boy will ruin our family name. People will derogate us. Father, there is still time. Poison him with your own hands. He talks rubbish just like that. You don't pay attention to him, son. You go to college, son. No. You don't need to blame yourself. My fate is like that. You must've heard of that couplet. “If not this, there would've been some other sorrow' "I am the one who has to cry in any condition' Don't blame your fate, Raja. Someone else's fate is also attached with it. "When I see you I feel ..." "You are my lover" "There was several youths in the world" "There's no one like you" "You are my beloved" "You are my love" "When I see you, I feel you are my Juliet, my Laila" "There was several beauties in the world" "There's no one like you" "You are my life, you are my love" "You come into my dreams..." "And make me wake at nights" "You make me long and yearn everyday" "I am always lost in your love" "I chant your name" "Never be annoyed, never leave me, I fear being away from you" "Seeing you I feel..." "You are my beloved, you are my love" Hey, move! You are standing in the queue since so long. Come on, move. Come on, hurry up. Come on, sit down quickly. - Where do you want to go? - One Oshiwara, - Give. - Where? -One Behram Baug. Rs.100?! Give me Rs.10 change. I don't have change. - Pardon? - I don't have Rs.100. Give Rs.10. Bhaiyya (brother), I don't have change. Bhaiyya, me?! Your father must be a Bhaiyya! I am from Mumbai. I was born and brought up in Mumbai. I was educated in Mumbai. If you address me as Bhaiyya, I'll thrash you so much ... that you'll even forget your father's name. Because of you people, common people don't get places in trains and bus. These jobless people have turned Mumbai into a pigeon house. Hey, what are you looking? Come on, give me change. I told you I don't have change. I said give me change. Why are you wasting time? Throw him out. We are fed up of these North Indians. Maharashtra government should change the name of BEST ... to Bhaiyya Transport. These beggars need to be chased out of Mumbai. - Come on, get down. - But I am giving the money. Then where is Rs.10 change? Then keep Rs.100. Hey, do you think I am a beggar? Come on, get off. - Get off! - Brother, please behave yourself. This is illegal. You aren't push anyone out like this. Will you teach me law? Come on, get off! If you wanted to commit suicide, why did you come in front of my bike? There are many other vehicles. Try them. Are you the one whom I saw near the VT station that day? And unknowingly you left your kerchief there. You keep other's belongings very safely. After all it is someone else's belonging. Until it is returned, the heart doesn't get peace. - Why did the bus driver throw you out? - I didn't have change. This is a city of stones. Here nobody thinks about others. Where do you want to go? Hop on, even I am going there. Here, you're at Jogeshwari. Where do you want to go? I don't know the address. I want to find a friend. Sir, do you know Shekhar? - I don't know any Shekhar. - Strange! - So you know Shekhar? He lives nearby. - I don't know. You don't know? Okay. Why don't you let me go? Try to understand. I am in hurry. If you are in a hurry, what can I do? I won't let you go inside unless I talk to Mr. Kaushal on the intercom. You are an ordinary watchman. I'll tell Mr. Kaushal and have you fired. Get me fired, I won't let you go. - Why won't you let me go? -Why not? Please listen to me. Hey scoundrel! Hey Raja! Hey, when did you come? Do you also want to meet someone here? And whom had you come to meet? - I... - Mr. Kaushal? To whom that man threatened to complaint and have you dismissed. Well, Raja. Shekhar, relationships don't change by changing the place. Neither they are like those clothes which one can removed ... and throw away whenever he wants. We are childhood friends. And till I am alive, even this relationship will exist for me. Yes, it could be a joke for you. Because you have started living in Mumbai. But we villagers even lay our lives for the sake of relations. And you know that very well. Raja, please forgive me. Come with me, I'll explain everything. I had lied to you in the village, Raja. Here there are cars around me, but not mine. They belongs to others. I have to clean them, guard them. The sweeper here introduces himself as aground engineer in the village. Raja, we come to Mumbai with big dreams. But the way waves of the ocean strike the shores and shatter. Similarly, after coming to Mumbai from the village ... our dreams shatter into pieces. You know? Here even to work as an office boy, you need to know English. Our leaders tell us to learn Hindi. Burn the English books. What's the result? Despite of doing graduation and post graduation... people can't even write their names in English. Forget speaking in English. After coming to Mumbai, one faces a better truth, Raja. And then one has to accept it as life. Anyway, forget it. But you didn't inform me about your arrival. How did you come all of a sudden? You didn't do the right thing, grandpa. You shouldn't have done this. You knew that I don't have anyone except you here. When I will become a police officer... and people will salute me... you won't be there to see. You have cheated me, grandpa. Before going, at least you should embraced me once. You should've at least kissed my forehead as usual. Along with your grandpa, even his dream has turned to ashes... which he has seen for you. But I don't see dreams. I live in reality. And son, the truth is that ... we are farmers. And our occupation is farming. Son, your grandpa was a farmer. Even I am a farmer. And even you will have to do farming. Yes, son. Now drop the idea of joining the police or army. Try to understand my point, son. Don't look at me like that. Go to the society office, take a sack of fertilizers... and go to the farm. Sugarcane Is being sown there. Hey! What sorry? Why do you always bump into me? I was coming to meet you. And I met you on the way. My family is going to fix my alliance. Then it's good, isn't it? Why are you sad about it? You should be happy that you are getting married. Raja, you never tried to read my eyes. Only one face resides in them. And that is you. Neha, remove this face from your eyes. Or else your eyes will be filled with tears. Do you remember in childhood we used to make paper boats in the rain. Your boat used to always get through. And my boat used to always sink. But Raja, without you ... Don't try get on a sinking boat, Neha. He took so long for such a small task. This useless fellow will never be able to do anything in life. Father, here I am. I've got it. - Great! Have you come? - Yes. Where were you since so long? What is this? - Where's the fertilizer? - How come the sack is empty? Useless fellow! Did you put it in the neighbor's fields on the way? Father, I had brought a full sack. Wonder how this happened. How did it become empty? Did the earth devour it or the sky swallowed it? Father ... Useless fellow, instead of bringing this empty sack, ... you should've brought some sticks. I would've cremated you in these fields. Today I will bury you in these fields. I will bury you alive. - How long will you drink my blood? - Father, please listen to me. How long will you harass me? Tell me. How long will you harass me? Now you tell me what should I do about you? Father, please don't hit me. Wait, where are you running? How long will you run away, useless fellow? After there where I stopped... I was in front of the railway station. Then wonder how I got into the train. And I reached Mumbai. Never mind. Now you have come here. I'll make all the arrangement for you. A post of a watchman is vacant in the other building. I'll recommend you. Come. - What are you saying, Shekhar? - What happened? Did I complete my education to become a watchman ? I will not work as a watchman, Shekhar. I want to fulfill Grandpa's dream. I want to become a police officer. Forget these dreams, Raja. No work is inferior. This is Mumbai, brother. Here several educated people struggle on the footpath ... all their lives and die. They don't get even a small house. You must be right, my friend. But believe me, I am not one of those unfortunate people. Trust me. I will surely fulfill grandpa's dream. You see. One day this entire city will surely salute me. I'll take your leave. But we will surely meet again. What happened? Did you meet your friend? Yes, I did. But even he has become like one of them after coming to the city. He has become a total stranger. I don't understand what should I do. I've spent my entire life in Mumbai. I couldn't understand it till today. How will you understand so soon? That's why it is called Mumbai. Just understand that some people find their destination very soon. And some people wander all their lives... they never find their destination. Now tell me what is your intention. Will you stay here or go back? - I can't go back to the village. - Then what will you do? -I don't know. - You must have decided something. Uncle, will you do me a favour? You want money? -No.-Then? Till I find some work, can I work on your stall? You can. But you won't get a salary. I don't want. I mean, you will get profit. We will share whatever we earn. Sit down. From today on this is your stall. Manage it properly. I'll go to the market. Hey boy, from tomorrow on you will also sell our stuff... along with fruits. What sort of stuff? Look, brother. This stall doesn't belong to me. The owner of the stall Uncle Abdul has gone out. I just work here. Alright. Then do a task for me too. Give a some good apples. Here, brother. - Rs.20 please. - Rs.20?! Do you know whom you are asking money from? I'll beat you to pulp. Understand? Look, brother. Uncle will think I stole the apples. You will have to give the money. You don't know who I am. I have to collect money from other people too. Don't chew my brain. Brother, if you don't give the money, I'll be in great trouble. Please try to understand. It is the question of my job. Job! Then [I fix your job. You will demand money from me. Here's some more! Brother, she is Sonia. Catch this lass! Hey, someone save her! Injustice is being done to alone woman. Please come. Save her. Hey brother, they will kill her. Look. Please save her. Someone come! Sonia is right. This is a city of stones. Nobody cares for anybody here. But Raja, you will have to think. Like others, will you also watch Sonia dying? What have you done! Come. Run away from here. Come fast before the police arrives. My grandpa wanted to make me a protector of law. But I have become a criminal. I've become a murderer. Why didn't I die before killing someone?! Grandpa, please call me to you. You haven't done anything. Hadn't you killed him, he would've killed you. It would've been better. A sit is what am I doing by being alive. I am struggling despite of being educated. Look, you haven't committed this crime deliberately. Even though if you feel that you have committed a crime... I am ready to take the blame oh myself. Because you committed this murder for my sake. How will that help? Will I be forgiven for my sin? I'll become a big sinner by getting you punished for my crime. I'll fall in my own esteem. I am a offender. I deserve to be punished. Please call the police. I want to surrender myself to the law. Look, Raja. It is said that one should think ... before taking a decision. We have one night's time. If you feel that you should surrender yourself to the police... I will accept whatever decision you take tomorrow morning. Please listen to my request, Raja. I've killed 50 till now. People say that Rajesh Sharma shoots first and talks later. That's why Rajesh Sharma's other name is Killing Machine. That's why I've called you. You have to do one more encounter. He has killed my brother. You have 12 hours time. The sooner you give the news of his death... the higher will be the reward. Assume that his bad time has started. You be free of worries. And await the good news of his death. Raja, he is my brother. Your name? Raja, he can't speak. - This means he ... - Yes. Whatever I've done till today, was for his sake. He means everything to me. The aim of my life. Sonia, Deshmukh here. Rajan Naik has give Raja's killing contract ... to encounter specialist Rajesh Sharma. And he has left for your house. Hurry up, we have to leave. But why? The law which you want to surrender to... it is coming to take your life. But law is for our protection. Why will it take my life? You will lose your life in this argument. This is Mumbai. There's no law here. Only money and politics is powerful here. Come on. Let's go quickly. -Come on. - Go and catch him. Don't leave. I won't spare you! "Unknown paths of an unknown city..." "... smiled at my helplessness" "My innocence suffered" "Life put me to test at every step" "What I had wished for, what you gave me" "Why is this your decision for me" "What is my state, O Lord" Thrash him so much that seeing his condition ... all the North Indians are compelled to leave Mumbai. What are you doing, Raja? The police is after us. Our life is in danger. And even here someone's life is in danger. Every state of India is every Indian's home. Everybody's blood is red. Then why so much hatred? Hey, why did you come in between? Is he your brother? I take every Indian as my brother. But when brothers start fighting amongst themselves... what will happen of the country? Looks like even you are a North Indian. Where have you come from? U.P. or Bihar? Hey, there are:31 states in India. 618 languages. 6400 castes. And despite of having 6 religions, India is united. Don't divide it in the name of religion and caste. Hey Bhaiyya, give this lecture elsewhere. Get lost from here! We made a mistake. Please forgive us. The hatred which you have in heart for us... more than that we have love for you in our hearts. Some to U.P.-Bihar someday. We take a guest to be God. Understood? Come on, Raja. Leave him. You all made me run a lot from morning to evening. But once Rajesh Sharma load his revolver... he doesn't go back without taking someone's life. Even I am a North Indian. But I regret that today you are destined to die. This fool saved you by giving up his life. But there are more bullets in this revolver which are for you. You scoundrel! Will you kill me?! Sonia, come on, pick him up and leave from here quickly. No, Raja. We were destined to be together only till here. No, Sonia. We will take him away from here. No, Raja. The police must be on its way. He laid his life to save you. Now if I am able to save you, his sacrifice will go futile. Let's go from here, Raja. You have come to meet me after six months. You did not phone me even once in past 6 months. - Auntie, he is Raja. - He's nice. Name is Raja? Nice name. Then he must be a king even at heart. The one who has won my Sonia's heart... he has to be a king. Right? No, auntie. Perhaps you are misunderstanding. We are ... You have chosen a life partner exactly the way your mother wanted. May you be happy all your life. I'll be back. "You have become dear to me than my life." "You have become the support of life" "You have become more loved than God" "You have become my love" "Your beauty has cast a spell" "I lost my heart" "I am intoxicated by love" "I want to sacrifice myself for you" "Such glances we exchanged" "My heart is yours, so am I" "My incomplete dreams came true in moments" "I will make your reside in every vein" "I don't want to live without you" "You have become dear to me than my life..." "You are merged in me in such a way" "Like fragrance in the flowers" "Your love is my life. Your love is my happiness" "My heart is crazy about you" "It knows no sorrow" "Your beauty has cast a spell.." "You have become dear to me than my life..." We entrust the charge of this boy named Raja to you. He not only killed an efficient officer of our department... in fact he has given us a very big challenge. If he is not stopped... in near future he will become a very big criminal of India. Please trust me, sir. The criminal whose file Rohit Raghav takes in his hands... that criminal can't escape. You are watching Live India. The biggest news is that a goon named Raja who is absconding ... after killed several policemen... Inspector Rohit Raghav has been given the charge to arrest him. The police department has issued the photos of Raja ... and the girl Sonia with whom he has absconded. And the public is requested that if they seem them anywhere... please inform on these numbers immediately. Let's go, Raja. Where are you going switching off the TV? Auntie, we have to go right now. Assume that we have to leave immediately. But we'll be back soon. How can you go like that? You must stay for some more days. No, auntie. We'll come some other time. Auntie, we'll be back soon. We have to go somewhere urgently. But where have you brought me? This is the only place where we can get help. Welcome! You are welcome. Sonia, I knew you'd come to me. Because whenever there's a problem, people come to Baba Kadam. That's why people call me Problem Shooter. Sonia, isn't he the same boy who killed Rajan Naik's brother ... and encounter specialist Rajesh Sharma? I didn't want to kill him. Whatever happened was an accident. Hadn't I killed him, perhaps I wouldn't have been standing alive... in front of you. You have always helped me since childhood. Whatever I am today, is all because of you. You are our only resort. No! No, Sonia. Don't say that. God is the one who gives support. I am just an ordinary devotee. And it is my duty to help people. But today I am very annoyed with you. Look. You work for me. If you had some problem, you should've come to me. You know, Rajan whose brother has killed... he's not an ordinary man. Okay, just assume that even if you killed him. Then you should've come to me directly. Had I spoken to someone, the matters wouldn't have become worse. Now you only had to do whatever is to be done, Baba. Or else the police will kill us. Or Rajan will kill us. Nobody kills anyone. Even he didn't kill anybody. To take and give life is all God's job. We are just a medium. Rajan, forgive the boy. No way! Bring them to my Chembur bungalow. Please come. Welcome. Wonderful! You were longing to meet him, weren't you? here he is. So you are Raja! No, Rajan bhai. Control your anger. Saint Kabirdas has said that anger is a cause of destruction. A sit is he is a North Indian. Use him in politics. He will be very useful. Brother, I did not do anything deliberately. I don't know how all this happened. I hadn't come to Mumbai to kill anybody. I had come here to fulfill my dreams. But I have lost my brother. And there's a rule of our business. Life for a life. And my principle is that for my benefit, forget others... I can even sell myself. People used to tell me that you are cruel. You sell drugs to innocent people and ruin their lives. But today I came to know that you're not only cruel, but also a beast. Shame on you. You are absolutely right, girl. I am a beast. But what are you? Don't you feel ashamed to wander with a pauper being a Patti? For me he is a human whom I love. Love! I give you area till Goregaon for bringing both of them here. Spread your business and enjoy. See you. If you all survive, only remember my words. In this world, don't trust even your shadow. Glory to Maharashtra! Wait, Rajan. Kill me if you must. I had taken up a fight with your brother. He just came in between. Let him go. I want the lives of both of you. But if you wish, I can leave you oh one condition. Raja will have to kill Food Minister Sanjay Shrivastav. Both are North Indians. The task can be done easily. And until this task is fulfilled, you will stay here. Think over. I give you :15 seconds. No need to waste:15 seconds, Rajan. I will do as you say. I can do anything for Sonia. No, Raja. What are you doing? No, Sonia. Sometimes life comes at such a juncture ... where there is no U turn. But Rajan, I want the guarantee that Sonia is safe here. Rajan Naik's word is firm. Now think about Sanjay Shrivastav, not Sonia. And you will have the key of the room in which Sonia will be. Hey, listen. If you don't shoot Sanjay Shrivastav... we will surely shoot you. And Rajanbhai will shoot Sonia. Now the lives of both of you are in your hands. Go! I just know that. We will have all the vote bank. Who are you? Where have you come from? Whom do you want to meet? - I've come from Gorakhopur. -So? I am Mr. Sanjay's neighbour. I want to meet him. Oh, so you are from his village. - Yes. - You want to meet him? - Yes. Sanjay is inside. But there's a security. - Complete the formalities. - Alright. - Go. So I was saying that the vote bank of Jadhavs'... Wait. Patriotism went away with Gandhiji, sir. Now there is only politics. Everybody is pulling each other's leg. The Parliamentary should be called vegetable market. Everybody screams so much as if they are selling vegetables. Sometimes I think I should leave everything... and go to Ha rid war. But for the sake of the love of our North Indians... for their service, I am sitting on this chair. Don't mention that scoundrel Daya Mathur. He is a corrupt man. Politics is defamed because of such people. He is a stigma on the North Indians. The North Indians hate Daya Mathur. Everybody knows ... that the deputy CM is Kulkarni's stooge. And listen. One crore North Indians of Maharashtra ... are all with me. Alright. Inform me as soon as the meeting is arranged. Tell me what can I do for you. Answer one question of mine. What would've been Nathuram Godse's helplessness while killing Gandhiji? Our question is strange. And you have come here to get the answer. I don't know... what would've been Nathuram Godse's helplessness. But I am helpless. I have to kill you. Please forgive me for your murder. If you will gain anything by killing me... I willing to die a hundred times. But before killing me, please tell me the motive behind it. If |I don't kill you, he will Kill me and my girlfriend. I know that you are a favourite leader of the North Indians. Even I am a North Indian. But I regret that I have no other option but to kill you. I won't stop you from killing me. Not at all. But I'll surely say that if you trust Rajan today... it will be the biggest mistake of your life. Because after killing me, Rajan will kill you and your girlfriend too. And if you don't believe me, go ahead and kill me. Kill me! - I've prepared the letter ... - Kill me! Shoot! Come on! Kill me! I can understand your mental condition. Go and tell him that you killed me. In a short while, the news of my death will spread in the city. And then you will also know Rajan's reality. Go. Looks like the job is done. Phone Bhai. Bhai, Sanjay Shrivastav is finished. Kill Raja too. Where did he go? She escaped. - Raja, are you alright? - Yes, I'm fine. - Let's go. - Raja, someone is calling. - Come here. Sanjay, you ?! Come on, get in. I knew you all would need me. That's why I came. She is my girlfriend Sonia Patti. Now both of you are with me. - There's nothing to worry about. - Thank you. The false news of killing Sanjay Shrivastav... then killed my men too. Raja has hurt me. Katia, your job has been:100% till today. Till today any task which you took in hand... you have always fulfilled it. And if you fulfill this task today... you will reach that position in the underworld ... where you always dreamt to be. Brother, with your grace this Shekhar has become Katia. I myself don't know how many murders I've committed. Tell me the name and address of the person. He will be dead before tomorrow evening. - This...? - What happened? Shocked seeing your friend's photo? Brother, I know him since childhood. He can never kill anybody. He doesn't have that much courage. He has committed 10 murders in 24 hours. He has killed my brother. And he has killed encounter specialist Rajesh Sharma. What are you thinking, Katia? Remember that day when you came into this business and I explained to you. That there's a small principle of politics and underworld. There are no friends here. Mother-father, sister-brother, daughter-son. These relations have no value here. Forget these relations. And if you want to become the uncrowned king of underworld... finish him and move ahead towards your goal. And from today on, it's your business to supply drugs ... from Ma him to Goregaon. I had become a little emotional. From now on the countdown of his life has begun. Note the time. He will be killed within 24 hours. Mr. Shrivastav, you have done us a very big favor. I don't know how to thank you. Why should you thank me? I am doing my duty. You will be absolutely safe in my car. Even the police won't stop it at the check post. And my driver will safely drop you at my farm house. Sir, I will always be grateful to you. Thank you. What happened? Why did you stop the car? Sir, Rajan's shooter Katia is standing there. Shall I remove the car from the other route? Which shooter? What shooter? He is my friend Shekhar. Sir, what are you doing? I am going to meet my friend Shekhar, what else. Shekhar, you?! Shekhar, you here?! Shekhar, my friend. What is this? Have you quit the watchman's job and joined the underworld? Come on, give me a hug. Today you have to embrace death, not me. My name is Katia. And Katia means death. But why? What wrong had done to you? - Take him. - Hey! - Get in. I'll do something, Raja. "Death laughs, life cries" "What a moment of troubles this is" "My blood flowed like tears" "But I endured everything with a smile" "Now I have no destination, nor any way" "What should I do? Tell me where should I go." "What is my state, O Lord" Look. This man is shot. This is a police case. First report to the police, then I can operate him. Hey doctor, if he dies, I'll set the hospital on fire. Do anything. Save his life quickly. After that I will register a report wherever you say. Alright. Take him in the operation theatre. Sir, I just saved his life. I know it's the doctor's duty to save one's life. You saved Raja's life. Alright. The way you fulfilled your duty,even the police has to fulfill its duty. Perhaps you don't know me. Forget humans, even rocks speak in front of me. You will have to take a decision. Your well being lies in speaking quickly. Tell me where is Raja. A girl had brought him here in an injured condition. And that girl took him away from here in a car. But I don't know where. AFTER:10 DAYS The people who snatch life from death ... are called God in this world. Life wants them to do a lot of things. Don't ruined your life like this. God forbid, what if anything had happened to you? What does this life want me to do? This is what I want to know. This life has made me a murderer. - Now what? - Wrong! Absolutely wrong. You are not a murderer. You are a patriot. You have killed the sinners. And killing sinners Is a biggest good deed in the world. You did not kill any innocent once. But how will we live like this? Till leaders like Rajan Naik and Kulkarni are alive. These are the biggest enemies of the North Indians. The deputy chief minister Kulkarni supports people like Rajan Naik. Considering the votes... some North Indian should be the deputy chief minister of this state. It's difficult for us even to stay like ordinary Indians in Mumbai. Everyday they keep spitting venom against in some or the other meeting Sometimes I feel like quitting politics and going away. But then I think about my brothers and sister and my North Indians. That who will take care of them after me. Who will look after them. Such corrupt leaders should be burnt alive at the crossroad. Who are trying to divide India. They are making brothers fight. Then I swear on the holy Ganges. I will kill all these traitors. Don't lose your senses in excitement. You will not do anything which might put your life at stake. You think about your and Sonia's life. And have faith in God. These people will surely be punished for their deeds. Yes, tell me, Deshmukh. Today Nagesh Kulkarni is going to inaugurate Hotel Peninsula Grant. At 4 p.m. today, actress Kim Sharma is going to perform there. Hotel Peninsula Grant, at 4 p.m. "Let it happen" " Love.." "Let love happen" "Let love happen" "Let love happen" "Whatever happens today, let it happen, O Love..." "Let eyes meet eyes, let lips meet lips" "Let the bodies unite" "Let the heart get ruined" "Let this sin of love happen" "Let it happen..." "This youth is full of passion" "It can't be control, it is very stubborn" "Of stories of love, of desires of the heart" "Let the storm come, this era s of storms" "Let's cross the limits" "Let this sin of love happen" "Let it happen..." "Let love happen" "Romantic is the mood, turned-on we are" "One who loves knows what fun love is" "Emotions wander, Feelings are wild." "Naughty is every beat, something is going to happen" "Let the heart get engrossed in excitement" "Let this sin of love happen" "Let the heart get ruined" "Let it happen" You've had enough fun. Now you're finished. You are watching Live India. The biggest news till now 1 is that ... Deputy Chief Minister Nagesh Kulkarni's mysterious death ... has caused a commotion in the city. There has been disorder... and his supporters have also set fire at many places. After the Deputy Chief Minister's assassination... the opposition parities have demanded President's rule ... in the state. And the police still hasn't been able to trace the murderer. Raja, you can't put your life at stake again and again. You are from my North India. I love you a lot. I want you to take Sonia and go far away. And spend a happy life. Raja, this is my battle. I will fight for the North Indians. And I won't hesitate even if I have to lose my life. When you can't fight for the North Indians without caring ... for your life, then why can't 1? Am I not a North Indian? No, you can't fight this battle. Because your entire life is in front of you, Raja. It's your duty to give Sonia a good life. And who do I have of my own? No wife, no children. The North Indians mean everything to me. And I don't want anything. I just want them to be happy. My life and death is for them. There's a very important party meeting today. Where the Deputy chief minister of the state will be elected. And as far as I think... Daya Mathur will be elected. Because he is Kulkarni and CM's stooge. He is selling the North Indians posing to be their leader. And Raja, do you know? I think perhaps I might give the resignation today. Because I can't see the North Indians' being sold to a traitor. I can't. -The CM here. - And I'm D from Dubai. What's happening in your rule? Do you know much money and efforts we had put in... to make you the CM and Kulkarni the deputy CM. Kulkarni's death is a big shock for us. I am trying to send you to the central. - But you were useless and will always remain ... - But brother... I still haven't permitted you to speak. Listen to me If that boy named Raja isn't caught... be ready to resign. Do you understand? You don't worry, sir. Let me become the deputy CM once... after that I'll find Raja from anywhere. - Right, Naik? - He's right. You will not be able to find Raja no matter how much you try. Only I can tell his whereabouts. Tell me quickly where he is. I will have the deputy CM's position. What nonsense are you talking? The CM has promised me for that. You keep quiet. You will become the deputy CM when my position is safe. At present I am worried about my position. Where is he? Do you accept my condition or... ...hot? Alright. I give you the position of the deputy CM. But you will have to give:25% of your ill-gotten money to Mathur. Do you accept? Tell me. I accept. Look, sir. There are one crore North Indians in Maharashtra. If |I don't become the deputy CM... everybody will come on the streets. And I'll take all of them and join another party. Stop talking nonsense! You're being given the Home Ministry. Even in that, you will earn not less than the deputy CM. Alright. I'll shake hands with Mr.Shrivastav for that. Come on. Let's embrace. That's better. Now, Mr.Chief Minister... can I fight the election for Kulkarni's seat which is vacate? We've made you win with our efforts. - Alright. But I want Raja alive or dead within 24 hours. - Sure. Mr. Shrivastav, at least tell me now where Raj a is. Where is he? So that I can send my men and ... ... finish him. He is safe till now only because of you. Now don't make this wrong accusation on me. I came to know today itself that he is hiding ... at film star Imran Khan's farm house. Someone has rightly said. That you should never trust a politician and a snake. You never know when they might attack. What happened, Raja? Now what, Raja? I am came to know today. That a politician has no religion or caste. He can do anything for his chair. He can even fool poor people like us and make us fight and die. I was used in the name of helping... North Indians get justice and patriotism. Today I came to know that Sanjay Shrivastav is the biggest traitor. I swear on the holy Ganges... now this Sanjay can't escape from me. Katia, I saved you from the police. I never let you face any inconvenience. I am a North Indian. And I can very well understand that only a North Indian ... can kill another North Indian. Just a way diamond cuts glass. You kill Raja. I'll send you to Dubai. I will also give Rs.10 crores. Lead your entire life in luxuries. Don't worry, sir. Your job will be done. Katia, I had got you kidnapped for this day. And I have protected you from everyone till today. Katia will kill Raja. And you finish Katia. Till one year the police won't take protection money from you. Will not arrest any of your men. Great. Mr. Shrivastav. What politics you have played! Now assume that Katia's game is over. Now you enjoy your politics. Nobody will know anything. We must end Raja's chapter as soon as possible. If any proof is left, it could create trouble for us. You send Inspector Rohit Raghav. And get Baba Kadam finished. Look, sir. Baba Kadam works for Bhai. Think over. Nothing should go wrong in this game. Leave that to me. - Yes, sir? - I've just for the news that... Raja, Katia and Baba Kadam are going to meet in some area at Jogeshwari. Today they shouldn't escape at any cost. Today none of them will escape from my hands. By the way from where did you get this information? Rohit, don't waste your time in unnecessary things. Go there immediately and do your duty. Mr. Mathur, hope Rohit does not suspect us. So what? We'll have him suspended. What all I had decided in life, and what has happened. My grandpa's soul curses me... that I didn't fulfill his dream. My father was right. I will put his name to disgrace. He was right, I am wrong. Don't say that, Raja. You haven't done anything wrong. Have faith in God. Everything will be fine. No, Raja! Nothing will be fine. Come, Shekhar. Today you have come to kill me for the second time. Instead of dying in the hands of the police, ... it's better to be killed by a friend. Shoot. Liberate me from this life. What are you thinking, Shekhar? Shoot. No, Katia. You can't kill Raja till I am alive. Sonia, I take you under my oath. You will not come in between. Please forgive me, friend. The desire to become rich... blinded me in such a way ... I also forgot what friendship means. But now this is your life, Raja. And I will lay it for you. I will lay it for you, Raja. These politicians belong to no one. They can go to any extent for their benefit. Rajan and Shrivastav has sent me to kill you. But I swear on our village soil, Raja. Now no one can cause you any harm. No one can. Wow! What friendship! What a dialogue! What a promise! People kill two birds with one stone, but today I ... will take three lives with one bullet. The principle of our business is ... that behind every person there's a spy. So what if Katia's attack failed? Baba Kadam's bullet will surely work. You ... - You scoundrel... - No, Shekhar. This scoundrel had sold me. Shoot, Baba. Here, Raja. I'll fulfill our desire today. Sir, looks like they've left just now. You make a report of these bodies. I don't think they must've escaped too far after committing the murder. - Okay, sir. - I'll go and see. - Come, Shekhar. - Yes. - Sonia, you wait here. So many weapons? Since when had you hidden them? Look carefully. These are the best weapons. Look, Raja. Now we have to finish these traitor. Whether we die or survive. I swear on the holy Ganges, Shekhar. Now no traitor will escape. Now we will go on a pilgrimage only after making the land of Mumbai pure. Where's Raja? I don't know. Take her. Wherever Raj a is, he will automatically come to me. - Take her. - Come, madam. Open the gate. Shut it! Now we will have to kill every traitor, Shekhar. - We must do what we have decided. -Where is she? Yes, Deshmukh. Tell me. Any news? Raja, Inspector Rohit has arrested Sonia. And he is going to kill her in an encounter today itself. Look, inspector. There is no enmity between us. Leave Sonia. You ordinary goon! Before talking, did you forget ... that law is an enemy of every criminal. What's wrong with you? Have you become a pauper... that you are begging to me? If you have the courage, come and take away your girlfriend. Hey Inspector, my name is Rajkumar Singh Yadav. And Yadav is only a king. Never becomes a pauper. I am telling you for the last time. Leave Sonia. Cut the scrap. Now I'll give you 24 hours of time. If you don't surrender yourself to me... I'll Kill your Sonia in an encounter. Hey stubborn crazy Inspector! Enough of your nonsense. Perhaps you don't know that I can commit several murders for Sonia. You'll be finished. No, Raja. Not here. We'll kill him at the car parking. Come with me. Where did he go? Raja, you look there. You here? Yes, it's me. The one whom you were going to kill, is my husband. Did you come to Mumbai to do all this? Had you come to create bloodshed? Didn't you feel ashamed to do all this? You kill people?! You are a killer beast. Why didn't you die before doing all this? You are right, Neha. Even I ask the same thing to God everyday. "Why didn't I die?' But you know that I didn't come to Mumbai to become a criminal. I didn't know that after coming here I would become a toy ... in the hands of some people, ... they will play with me... and within no time I would become India's most wanted criminal. Mr. Rohit, everyday thousands of flowers blossom. But no flower blossoms willingly to be offered on someone's coffin. Neha, congratulations for your marriage. Today I don't have anything. That's why I can't give you any gift. But I can surely give my life. Mr. Rohit, take this gun and shoot me. Raja, stop! Don't make such a mistake. This inspector will kill you. I don't care. Now why should I live ... when I've fallen in the esteem of my own people? Don't get too emotional. Let's go. You'll also land me in trouble. Come on. Rohit, please help Raja. He is innocent. Get off. Go, you are free. You were going to kill me in an encounter, right? Look. Tell Raja to forget whatever happened. He should take the law in hands. I will help him. This is my guarantee. He should surrender himself to the law. - Tell me. - I don't need to tell the name. Because your recognize my voice very well. The thing which one gets habituated to... it is very hard to give up. And I am habituated to luxuries, Rajan-bhai. I can tell you Raja's whereabouts on one condition. If you give me Rs.5 crores and a ticket to Dubai. Alright, tell me his whereabouts. You will get your reward. Then listen carefully, brother. After 45 minutes from now, Raj a is going to meet Sonia... at Lokhandwala Cinemax. Katia had phoned. Raj a is going to Lokhandwala Cinemax to meet Sonia. Maybe this is their scheme to trap me. If this is true, bring Raja and Sonia's dead bodies. And if it is a lie... Then bring Katia's body as a gift. - Go! -Come on. No matter how smart you are... you can't be more intelligent than Rajan. But according to me, you are the biggest fool. You fool! You sent all your men away? Now who will save you from me? You are finished, Rajan. Now what do I do? What should I do? I'll be killed from both sides. Getting influenced by you, Katia can betray his friend once. Not again and again. - Understand? - Look, there she is. Where will you escape? Do you remember you had said that you will kill me ... where there won't be any water. But today I will make you drink water till you die. No, Raja. I have to settle accounts with him. I will handle him. Well done, Shekhar! One traitor is finished. Bloody Rajan! Shekhar, what have you done? My friend, you laid your life to save me? Raja, my brother. We were destined to be together only till here. But do tell the villagers that I did a good deed. And promise that you will kill these traitors ... and make the land of India pure. Yes, I will. But please don't leave me and go. I am there ... I... I swear on you. Till I don't kill these traitors and make the land of India pure... I won't rest in peace. He killed Rajan miserably. Now he will attach us. He should be finished at any cost. No, Mr.Shrivastav. Out of fear, I've arranged for a Z security. Even you get strict security arrangement for yourself. As soon as Raja dies, I will go on a pilgrimage that very moment. No need to be so disturbed. Raja won't live for long. What's happening? Move ahead from the right. Hey, move aside. Can't you see? - Drive at a side. - Yes, sir. - Hey, why did you halt in between? - The vehicle broke down, sir. - Sir has to go. - Yes, sir. - Hurry up. -I am trying. I am trying. It is not starting. Mathur, you are finished. Mr. Mathur, what happened? These three stars which adorn your shoulder... only the police and the army have the right to wear them. Even the Prime Minister and the President can't wear them. You are honoring them a lot! Police is being ridiculed on every news channel and newspaper. Murders are taking place in board day light. And you all are sitting quietly. Even I have decided. If this goon named Raja is not arrested within 24 hours... you will not be able to wear this uniform. Understand? This uniform is not charity given by you. You can surely give me orders. Tell me. Impose a curfew in the city tomorrow. Perhaps you are forgetting that tomorrow is 15 August. That's why I'm telling you. Tomorrow I have to go to Kranti Maidan ... to give a speech. And wonder from where that goon might attack. And you won't be able to save me. If there's a curfew in the city, even the public won't be able to ... come out of their houses. I want to protect my life. No matter if the public have to face inconvenience. And these poor people are born every day like insects. Their life or death makes no difference to the country. But there should be some reason to impose a curfew, sir. Now I will have to tell you the reason too. Do you work in the police department or in a barber's shop? Go out and do an encounter of a few North Indians. And put the blame on the Maharashtrians. After that riots will automatically take place in the city. And after that automatically curfew will be imposed in the city. Perhaps this will be the first independence day ... when flag will be hoisted. But the public of the independent state will be confined ... in their homes like slaves. Hope there's nothing to worry, Inspector. Everything Is fine, sir. Be patient. Mr. Sanjay will give an interview to everybody. Come, sir. Please come, sir. The people of my state, I regret that today you all couldn't come here... to hear my speech. Last night riots took place in many parts of the city. Because of which curfew had to be imposed in the entire city. I request you all That you all shouldn't fight amongst yourselves. This goon names Raj a is a terrorist. He is a traitor. The police has issued an order of shoot at sight for him. If you see this goon anywhere... beat him to death. This goon has spread terror and violence everywhere. Someone stop him! Sir, he has ruined your plan. No, Shrivastav, The public should finish a sinner like you, not me. You are the biggest sinner of this world. So it is our duty to finish you. Soldiers, shoot him. Yes, shoot. But see, even you all will die along with me. Nobody will shoot. Or else all of us will be killed. No one will shoot. Shrivastav, politicians like you are the biggest traitors... who make poor people like us fight amongst ourselves ... as North Indians and West Indians for your selfish interest. Shrivastav, perhaps you have forgotten. That Mahatma Gandhi ... Bhagat Singh, Subhash Chandra Bose, Vinoba Bhave... Veer Savarkar, ... Shivaji Mara the, Babasaheb Ambedkar. None of these great men said that they are North Indians ... or West Indians. They said only one thing. That we all are one. India is one. Someone stop him. - Put the guns down. - Put them down. Today is independence day. And you are a true politician of this country. For whom poor people like us even shed our blood. Come on, sing the national anthem. Sing or I'll press the button. Sir, sing it or he'll press the button. Respect to the Motherland. This is not the national anthem. Mr. PA, then you sing it. Stand straight. This is the national anthem. Thou are the ruler of the minds of all people, ... dispenser of India's destiny. "Best in the world is our India. We are the birds ..." He'll press the button, sir. You all are political leaders. One of you all may sing. I will spare you all. Look. The country in which they intend to rule... they don't remember that country's national anthem. Yes, they do remember that ... once you get the chair... you must loot the country. Make the innocent public of this country fight amongst themselves. Not me, they are the biggest traitors. Tell your reality the public of this country. And confess your crimes. Please confess, sir. Or he'll press the button. Confess. No, don't press the button. I confess. I confess in front of you all... that I made you all fight amongst each other... and imposed the curfew in the city today. To save my position... I made a innocent man like Raja a terrorist. I confess that I did all this. Sir, you only got Mathur and Kulkarni killed. Confess it, or hell press the button. Speak. I confess ... I confess that I got Kulkarni and Mathur killed. I admit. Please don't hit him. You are a nice man. Please don't hit him. You are a nice man. Look, Shrivastav. This is not a bomb, but a toy. Scoundrel! Run, Shrivastav! You scoundrel! Inspector. Raghav, save me from that goon. This man will kill me. Please save me. Hey, save me or I'll have you dismissed. I can afford to lose my job, but I won't save a traitor like you. If our police starts saving leaders like you... our country will be into pieces. I won't spare you. I'll kill you. I won't spare you alive, Shrivastav. Shrivastav, you are finished! Here, Mr. Rohit. My job is over. Arrest me. I may not be in this department tomorrow. But I salute you for your good deed. That people are saluting you. Don't clap. I haven't done anything brave. I am a criminal. I've committed a crime. I deserve to be punished. So that once again no educated jobless man picks up a weapon. Another Raja shouldn't be born again. Mr.Rohit, arrest me. Have me sent to the gallows.
