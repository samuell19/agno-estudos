THE TWO ORPHANS It's a cartload of harvesters. Nice wagon they have. They're always so happy. Thank you, sir. A pear, madam? - Thanks. They aren't fully ripe, but we were leaving so I grabbed them regardless. You're going to live in Paris? - Yes, madam. There's nothing left for us in the countryside. We're orphans. The doctor advised me to go to Paris to seek treatment for my eyes What's happened? Can't you see? - The axle's broken. The axle has snapped. - It needs a wheelwright to fix it. What are we going to do? - I don't know. What's going on? - An axle has broken. Stop, will you? There's no way we can move on until tomorrow. Until tomorrow... This means a long wait. Yes, but if the coach can't be repaired sooner we'll just have to be patient. Come on, let's sit you down. Listen, Henriette, won't Mr. Marcel give up waiting for us? We can go straight to his house. I have his address. Poor little Pierrot's not singing. He must be frightened. Maybe he's hungry. - Could be... Wait here, I'll try to find some foliage. Good day, miss. Did I startle you, Miss Henriette? You're surprised that I know your name? I heard it back there. It's natural that I wouldn't forget. Here are some flowers. Aren't they pretty? Not as pretty as you. So, are your parents in Paris? No, we are orphans. Someone is waiting for you? A friend? A guardian? We have been referred to a gentleman. Somebody you know? - No, sir. Is he rich, at least? - That I don't know. You must find someone who will be able to give you a comfortable existence, don't you think? And who knows, this someone you might perhaps find, could be close at hand. Excuse me, sir. Someone's waiting for me. I found some irises. - Really? - Yes, they're very pretty. And I've brought some herbs for Pierrot. Carry my case to the inn. I'm staying here tonight. I see. If we end up here for the next 8 days, I wouldn't be surprised. What's this? - Haricot beans. Take them this with my regards. Thank you, sir. What's this? - Some chicken. What weather! With the compliments of the marquis. Who? Seems like a rough night ahead! The cage... Their room is at the top of the stairs. The marquis can't mistake it. Here, sit down. Is the room nice? - Yes, very nice. What was that? - The lock doesn't work. We don't have to worry about burglars. I'm sure we won't be able to sleep tonight. I'll sleep, I assure you. I'm absolutely worn out. What's that? - Nothing. Go to sleep. Will you wake up? Lafleur!? What? What's up? What do you want, for pete's... Oh, excuse me, marquis sir. Is it time, already? - No. But we must leave immediately. - Yes... yes... We'll leave... Will you wake up? Listen to me! - I'm listening, marquis sir. What's this all about? Well, tomorrow morning, when we arrive in Paris, you'll go to Pont Neuf. To Pont Neuf? - Yes, to Pont Neuf. There, you'll await the arrival of the stagecoach. The stagecoach? You'll be in the courier's courtyard... Leave me alone, will you? Excuse me, friend... When is the coach from Normandy due to arrive? I haven't a clue. Ask in the office. The Normandy coach has had an accident. An accident? Yes, on the Evreux road. A broken axle. They aren't close to arriving. This is a pain. It's the third time I've put myself out to no purpose. You must be waiting for someone? - Yes, two young girls. Two young girls? Hold on, you aren't Mister... Mr. Martin. Why? It's just that I have a message to give to you. Yesterday evening on the road, when my sedan overtook the coach, one of two young girls... Henriette? ...asked me: "See Mr. Martin. Tell him that my sister is somewhat unwell and that we are remaining in Evreux until tomorrow". Then it seems like I must come back once more? From the other side of Paris! And all for two young girls that I don't even know! I've had enough of this. They know my address. They can sort it out themselves! Charity, from a good soul... - Go to the devil! May the Good Lord strike you dead! I don't give to the elderly. Who's elderly! Amazingly, Mr. Martin isn't here. - He's bound to come. Here's somewhere to sit down. Never mind, I'll find us a carriage. We can go direct to Mr. Martin's. A carriage? This will cost us even more. - I'll negotiate a price. Wait here. You just keep going straight ahead. Don't panic. - Help! Get off me! - Into the carriage. Help! Help me someone! Louise! Help! Henriette! Let go of me! I don't want to! You brutes! Come on! Help! Help me, Louise! Henriette! Wait for me! Where have you gone? Look out! On which side is it going? Blimey! You must take more care! Where's she gone? - Who? My sister. - What sister. My sister has disappeared. - When was this? Just now. Where is she? I've no idea, I haven't, but you'll find her again. Madam, don't abandon me, I'm begging you. What about your parents, my child? Oh no, we're orphans. - Then you have some friends? But we've only just arrived in Paris. We don't know where to go. All the same, you should've been more careful! My horses almost ran you over! If I'd crushed you, they'd have pinned the blame on me. I didn't know which way to go. I am blind. Blind? No parents? And she's young and pretty. Well, what are you lot up to? The show's over, be off with you! Don't desert me, I'm begging you. Listen, my child... I am the honest mother of a family. I'd be happy to give you shelter while we wait for you to find your sister. Thank you, madam. But will we find her? - Oh yes, oh yes. The only thing is, it might take a while, you know? Come on, come with me. What about my suitcase? She even has a suitcase! And where is it? Over there, by the embankment, that's where I left it. And what are you doing here, you? Make sure you don't pick up the wrong luggage. - Okay, okay... Is this birdcage yours? - Yes, madam. I'm very grateful to you, madam. It's worked out well for you, child. Come. Come, my child. Careful, there are three steps down. Wait for me to help you. 1... 2... ...and 3. Done. ??? because climbing with this bag takes the wind out of my sails. Are you still here, madam? - Yes, my child, don't worry. Why are you waiting to offer her a chair? She's blind. Would you like a bite to eat before turning in? No, madam. Thank you. Of course, the poor little thing isn't hungry. All this upset takes away the appetite, eh? Well, I'll ready a nice cosy bed for you in the nice upstairs' bedroom. I couldn't sleep, madam. Oh yes, you'll sleep, my child. You'll see. There's no need to worry. As for you, why are you waiting to hand me the blanket? Sluggard. Don't be alarmed, miss. I only want to help you to sit down. Who is that woman? She's my mother. Be careful... because... Well now... it's time for floods of tears, is it? Just because you're sad doesn't mean you have to fall apart. I, too, had my sadnesses and I didn't cry. It's because I was thinking of poor Henriette. But we'll find your poor Henriette! Only it'll take a lot of searching. You'll have to search all Paris with me. Yes, madam. I'll follow you everywhere. - That's the thing, my child. Until then get some sleep, so we can out walking tomorrow. Why are you waiting to bring the suitcase up? What's this you've got here? It's pretty. You weren't going to sleep with this? It's a momento from my adoptive mother. I never remove it. Well, you'll start tonight! You risk losing it. Come on, my angel. But my poor sister... - Your sister, your sister... Relax, we'll find her or my name isn't La Frochard. Rest assured, I'm not going to abandon an orphan who's a stranger in Paris. Hold the bannister tightly, my child. Here's your room. It's cosy here, with a nice little bed. So, you're an orphan? Yes, madam. I am an abandoned child. They found me one evening on the steps to Notre Dame. It was snowing. I was well wrapped up in warm clothes... ...but I would've died of cold if I hadn't been found by a passerby. It was Henriette's father. He took me back to their home. He brought me up. He was good to me. Better than my unknown parents. Even mummy... ...she didn't want me. There are some wicked people in this world, Lord knows! Get undressed, I'll help you. So, what happened to him, this good man? He died last month. He's much better off now, him. - No, don't cry, come on... Today, you've rediscovered a mother. I've already got 2 sons, I have. Pierre, the runt downstairs. And Jacques, my oldest. But that one... he's something else. He's a real man. The spitting image of his poor father. Do you want one? - A stolen watch... thanks. Beats working, eh? Lazybones. - At least I've not been in jail. You, the merchant of morality... ...when I'm forced to buy something, this is what I pay with! It's not worth giving me a beating, you know you're stronger than me. There are times I almost feel sorry for you. After all, it's not your fault if you're misshapen. Keep still! Jacques... are you coming? Yes, coming... Here, sharpen my knife. And make sure it cuts! Sleep, my angel. You'll be undisturbed here. I'm going to pray to the Good Lord that we can find your beloved sister. What are you doing there? Are you spying on me? Take this. This too. What are your plans for that young girl? My meal ticket. ...an angelic creature, I'm telling you! What did he say? - An angelic creature. ??? And you found her on the road? - Yes, old bean, on the road. And when will we see this creature? Not this evening! She's come from the farmyard so he's waiting until her hands are clean! You can jest... but give me just 8 days and you'll see. Bravo! All we want is to see her. So it's not that you're trying to find more dancers? The dancers? Are they here? They're getting dressed in the blue room. They're getting dressed! I'm going to them! Hey, satyr, try to behave! If I wanted to behave I wouldn't be dressed as a satyr! Who's got my curling iron? Not me! - Me neither. - Here it is. The satyr comes looking for the nymphs. Oh no, ladies... the ballet is about to commence. And I am here to help you with your costumes. Very well, ladies. Very well... but I will have my revenge at midnight. Midnight, that's the time for sacrifice! What sacrifice? - You'll see. What will they do with us? - How dumb are you!? You should know, it won't kill you. Listen, at midnight we dim all the garden lights... And then what? - Then... every man for himself! And no shrinking violets. - And forget about your virtue. Just like that? All at once? In the dark? To the sound of violins, my sweet. - Therein lies the poetry. How awful! - It's not awful at all. It's awful that one's not going to see the one who... What is it? The Marquis's orders have been carried out. Tomorrow. - The thing is, she's here. Who? - That young provincial girl. Where is she? - In the blue room. Fool! Who told you to put her there? But marquis... - You're always screwing up! You're fired. You're no longer part of this household. - But marquis... Luckily, I've already had enough cash off him. What's going on? She's here. - Who? The angelic creature is here! ??? What's up, old sport? Your face looks like thunder. Not in the slightest. She's opening her eyes. She's pretty. - She looks like a provincial. Button your lip. - She's delightful, this doll. Oh no, she's a commoner. Let me see those hands. She has the hands of a peasant. - Oh shut up, you're jealous. You're safe and sound with me, miss. You've nothing to be afraid of. Is that you, sir? - Yes, miss. I'm most flattered that you recognise me. But what am I doing here? You made such a strong impression on me that I couldn't resist the pleasure of seeing you again. Therefore I had you brought here by my men. Where's Louise? - Who's Louise? Take me back, she's waiting for me. You must! Allow me firstly to offer you some champagne. But.. listen, sir, I'm begging you. You don't realise. You've separated me from my sister who's helpless without me. She's blind. - Blind? What was that? - Her sister's blind. She's all alone in Paris where she doesn't know anyone. Where nobody knows her. - All right, I'll send my men. They'll fetch this child. Calm down. And from tomorrow morning... - No... But as I've told you... Don't get worked up. After a glass of champagne... Nobody gets out of here until they've paid their debt to pleasure. Let me through. You can go tomorrow... Is there nobody here who will come to my aid? Come on, my child... - Are there any gentlemen here? We are all gentlemen, sweetie. You are all swine. Harsh words. She's right. Chevalier... I'll say it again... she's right. Brute! - Oh no... Let me go! You aren't going to detain this young girl by force? Chevalier, mind your own business... Let go of her! - I don't take orders in my own home. You're treating me like a lackey! A lackey that behaved like you, I'd have him flogged. You give me cause by that insult! - You don't deserve the honour! Vaudray, you're the swine! All right, whenever you want! - Right now! A sword, bring me a sword! Leave me alone. I well know what I'm doing. I'm going to kill you! Gentlemen, you are all witnesses. Touche. - Wretch, what have you done? Gentlemen, you will all testify that everything passed according to form. What are you going to do? - Come on, miss, we must fly. POLICE REPORT Nothing new? - Nothing new. Is His Excellency there? - Yes. Alone? - No, but you can go in. Good day, Excellency. - Good day, Marest. So, what about this duel? Your Excellency can read for himself. - Yes. Whatever happens, this report mustn't be appended to your family file. Your nephew is young. Be indulgent. Don't pursue this case. Sir, in naming me Lieutenant General of Police, His Majesty gave me a great honour, one I'd ill acknowledge if I wasn't myself a good example. You mentioned the file on my family? - Secret, Excellency. Secret, yes, of course... How's Mrs. Lignieres today? The Countess enjoyed a quieter night. - Splendid. Hello, doctor. - Hello, madam. How are you feeling? - Better, doctor, thank you. May I? - I'm very ill, aren't I? The same attacks again, of course. A touch of fever, delirium. Delirium... Did I say anything? - Yes. You recounted for us some remarkable things. What exactly? What did I say? - It was hard to understand... It was a fearsome story. You spoke of a church, snow, an abandoned child... No, relax, it was all gibberish. Come on, don't start up again. Madam, you must cease these charitable works, they exhaust you. There are so many unfortunates... Give me something. You see, I still had to question a passerby. Well, he's heard nothing of your sister Henriette either. You're going to great lengths for me, madam. I'd like very much for you to find her again, my child. But why have we stayed in the same place so long? Because lots of people pass by here. What are you going there? She's doing nothing, good officer. She's resting. You know that begging is prohibited. If I see you again, I'll throw you in prison. We'll be on our way... come on, my angel. May the Good Lord blight those ugly mugs! Madam... - What's up? What? ...You had me begging! - Well, why not? But I don't want to! - But I want to. I've taken you in, cared for you like a princess. This costs money. I don't have a pension, I don't. You must earn the bread that you eat. I don't want to! - Please put a sock in it! Walk! Come on... - No. Mercy! Help! - There's no need screaming like that. Listen to me... Look, you're right. I was wrong to lose my temper with you. Let's go home. So I won't have to beg any more? - Oh no... You know how kind I am. I wouldn't want to force you. Come on, we're going home. Goodbye Countess, see you tomorrow. Good evening, doctor. And you, Roger dear, what's new? Nothing of any import, aunt. Nothing of any import? Really? - Greetings, uncle. Nothing of any import... Aren't you somewhat proud of your latest exploit? What exploit? - Put simply, a duel. The Marquis de Presles is half-dead. And do you know why? Because of a girl. For a girl, no sir. For a young girl that I love. You know, you can only love a young girl if you respect her. I respect her. - You respect her... You're forgetting that I see every police report. This young girl lives with you, under your roof. - Not any more, sir. Really? - She's working. She's working... - She's taken a position as a milliner. A milliner? You no doubt paid the cost of her placement. Buck up, sir... you must alter how you live, and marry someone from your own class. Your uncle is strict, but he's right. You should get married. - But aunt, I want to marry. But marry whom? - This young girl. Silly Roger, this love will only bring you grief. You must show fealty to your own. You can tell me this? You, the victim of a similar fealty? What do you mean? Listen, aunt... I know your secret. Me? I have no secret. Oh yes... I know that before your marriage you loved another man. That man is dead. To conceal your error, they removed your child from you born out of wedlock. Then your family forced you to marry the Count. You see, I know the whole picture, aunt. I was guilty and I was punished. But her... that poor baby... she'd done nothing. What became of her? I don't know. They took her from me. They left her on the steps of Notre Dame,... despite the cold. Despite the snow. It would've been better to kill us... Yes, to have killed us both. Don't despair, auntie. You'll find her again. After eighteen years... Where is she now? She must be dead. What's the matter? Are you crying? - Oh no. Yes, you're crying. Why? - It's nothing. You said, "she must be dead". Of whom were you speaking? Roger, I need words with you. Wait in my office, will you? Goodbye, aunt. - Goodbye, Roger. The boy told me all his troubles, it got me emotional. You weren't weeping for him but for yourself. Why? Why won't you answer? I am never to know what it is that upsets you? Jeanne, you don't love me. You mustn't say that. - Oh yes It's precisely because I love you... I'd rather die than cause you suffering. But you do so much for me. I'm well aware I don't deserve it. Forgive me... there's nothing I can tell you. Very well. Why is she crying? Marest! That file we were just discussing... - The one on the Lignieres' family? Fetch it for me. - Very good, Excellency. With the help of the file, maybe I'll find what I'm looking for What's that? The explanation to this mystery that I feel surrounding me, surrounding my wife. And if there is in our family history a secret... I will discover it. Thank you, Marest. Sir, don't open that file. - Why? I want to know and I will know. Here it is. Jeanne Eleonore, daughter of the Count de Vaudray. Sir, you mustn't read it. - Why? - It's unworthy of you. There's a secret that doesn't concern you. It would be almost like breaking the confessional. Who's to stop me? - Me. Perhaps you're right. You have just served to remind me of my duty. I will in my turn compel you to do yours. Goodbye. The young girl living with the chevalier, no longer lives with him. She is, it appears, placed somewhere in a hat shop. I want to know her new address. And when I get it... I'll tell you what needs to be done. You aren't going to finish working? Can we maybe get some sleep? Give me my shoe. What about mother... is she back yet? Where did I just put my tobacco? Well... get me a light! Your crooked leg suits you, runt. Listen, Jacques, there's something I've been meaning to ask. Well, go ahead. When Louise is here... don't call me "runt". - What's that? She can't see... therefore she doesn't need to know... ...know that you have a club foot, a hunched shoulder? Jacques, if I'm crippled it's because of all those beatings you gave me when I was young. I see, you want Louise imagining that you're handsome. By any chance, are you... That would be amusing. The runt in love with a blind girl. And you want her believing that you're a beefcake! Oh you know... if it turned out there was someone for whom I was not an object of repulsion, someone who thought I was like everyone else. This would make me so happy. Okay, I get you. I'll wear kid gloves when talking about you. I'll call you "ladykiller". Oh no, I don't want... - Oh yes, it's nice, "ladykiller". Come on in then. Come on, allez oop. Now we must talk. - What's she done? Missy doesn't want to beg. I make her ashamed! Poor dear. She wanted to make a ruckus on the streets. She's a lazybones. She was yelling to alert passersby. Hold on, I'm going to give her something to cry about! Don't! Can't you see she's sick? Sick?... She's faking, that's all! I suppose the princess should put her feet up while I work, eh? She'll do what she's ordered. No, I'm not going out again. You could always run away. You won't get far. You were happy once when you found me when you were deserted on the streets. No, I will not relent. I don't want to beg any more. No more begging? And how are you going to eat? No work, no bread. You aren't going to let her die of hunger? She'll beg for mercy first. - Never. Well, we'll soon see about that after 3 or 4 days of fasting. Meanwhile, crawl up to your attic. And don't expect to come out. I'll come out free... or dead. But I'm coming out... How beautiful you are. - Jean, let her go! That's enough of this! Come on, my angel, we'll let you out after 3 days. Meantime, I'll double-lock you in. This way, we'll be undisturbed. Pipe down, will you? - What's going on? The lookout! The lookout? I'm going to turn you in. Talk, and you'll join us in prison. The thought scares you, eh? - Yes, it scares me. It scares me that I might not see her again. Come on, fetch us a drink. "Yes, it scares me..." ..."I might not see her again". Say, mother, give me the key for upstairs. What for? - So I can check one evening how she is. Plus... Understood, madam. Goodbye. Angelique? Come down. - Yes, miss. Deliver this bonnet to this address. And be sure not to dawdle on the way. - No, miss. Good day, Henriette. Is there any news? - No, nothing yet. We'll never find her. - Yes, we'll find her. You mustn't talk like that. You know I'm doing all I can. I know what a good man you are. Only the more time passes... sometimes I give in to despair. Come on, you mustn't despair, Henriette. - Oh yes. If it wasn't for you, I don't know what would've become of me. I can see you so seldom... Yes, but for me it's become like a sport. I wait for you, I guess your step. I know... I shouldn't be telling you this. But you must tell me. My only happy moments are the ones spent with you. Me too. However this happiness feels like a reproach. I shouldn't be laughing, it isn't right while poor Louise is still lost. You've nothing to reproach yourself for. We'll manage the impossible. Listen, you shouldn't stay alone. You need some distractions. Would you like us to go out together this evening? Oh, I couldn't go out. Even with me? - No, I couldn't. Okay, I won't insist. But when Louise is rescued... - Oh then... See, miss, I didn't dawdle. - Yes, splendid. Next time, don't be in such a hurry. Pierre, is everything all right? It's almost done. That's got it! What's all this? Damaging my splendid abode... I wanted her to have some bread. - It's none of your concern! But she's dying of hunger. - And whose fault is that? If she acts willfully, it's correct that she's punished. But she needs to eat! - That's not your affair. Give me that. You know what, he can go on the same diet as her. Good idea, mother. He can do without eating until he's on the verge of croaking. No, don't. Not him. I'll do whatever you want. I promise. You'll beg? - Yes, I'll beg. Careful mother, she's a bad 'un. Once outside, she'll seek help from passersby. If she should try, she's blind so we could put her in Quinze-Vingts and she'd never get out. So, will you sing? Yes, I'll sing. There, you see... Now she's being reasonable. Here's your crust. Miss, a customer wants you. Don't bother, miss. I took the liberty of coming up. Have a seat, madam. Thank you, miss. Please sit down as well. You know the chevalier de Vaudray? Well... yes, madam. He's my nephew. I know his feelings towards you and I've come to tell you that if I can be of assistance, I'll do so gladly. Thank you, madam. At the moment, I can think of only one thing... Yes, I know. Finding your sister. - Yes, madam. How old is she? - Louise is eighteen. Eighteen? And she's called Louise. It's a name I love greatly. You're both the same age? - Yes, madam. I call her my sister because we were raised together but nobody knows her family. She was a foundling. A foundling? One winter's evening, daddy was passing through Paris and he saw a poor abandoned child on the steps of Notre Dame. She was half-buried under the snow. Her hands were turning blue from the cold. He took her in his arms to warm her. He brought her back to the house. We were very hard up in those days. All the same, my mother wanted to keep her. Was there nothing on the child that would allow later identification? Oh yes, madam. On raising the clothes, two rolls of gold coins slid down and there was some paper on which was written: "Her name is Louise. Love her." And we loved her, madam. That's good. That's good that you did. You're right, she must be found. It must be done quickly. - But, madam... How long since she disappeared. - It was three months ago. And you've had no news since? - Nothing. And Roger has no clues? Nothing, madam. Didn't Roger mention she was blind?... Yes, madam. For how long? - For two years. How did this happen to her? Tell me. Remember that year of the harsh winter... Yes. She caught a cold and... And what? We returned from mass... Tell me! - She developed a chill and... Sing louder. You must earn the bread you eat. Will you stop wiping your eyes? It attracts the passersby. But that's her. It's her voice. It's Louise! Are you Henriette Gerard? - Yes, but... - One moment... Were you born in Evreux? - Yes... Been in Paris three months? - Yes, but... Good day, madam. - Hello, Marest. - My God, her voice is going. I am ordered to detain you. - Me? This is impossible. Why? Why? What's she done? On whose orders? Those of the Lieutenant of Police, madam. We're to escort her to La Saltpetriere. - To prison? To prison? It can't be! What have I done? Sir, you can arrest me when I've seen her. Madam... - Yes, I'm going. Let me through! Come on, take her away. - No... Calm down, come on! - But why? What are you doing here? - Let me pass, I'll explain later. I'm begging you... Let go of me. Let me be reunited with her. Be sensible. Everything will work out. I swear I won't try to escape. Can we go, Excellency? - Yes, go. Let me go, I... First tell me why you're here. - I'll explain more later. But for now, let me leave. Let me bring her back. Bring her back? Who? But I... We can't hear her singing any more. - But who? I can't... I can't... Very well. You've no other business here? No. - Let's go home. What do you call yourself? Come on, answer! Answer me. Cat got your tongue? - Come on, gentlemen, please. Mother, take pity on me. I've done nothing. There's nothing I can do for you, my child. Take her to the infirmary. Madam... - What is it? I'm so cold... - Well, that's good. It should make these bourgeois dogs feel sorry for you. Say, mother... ...how's business? - Not too bad. So fork out for a bottle of the good stuff. If you want, you crook. You, while we're gone... sing up! I'm nearby and have my eye on you. Oh, you're here. Lazybones! Come and alert us when mass is finishing. But this is your coat, Pierre. You'll get cold. Take it. - No, you keep it. I have my vest on underneath. I'm not cold. Poor Pierre... if it wasn't for you, I could never bear this life that I'm leading. They've made you most unhappy. Happily... Happily you've taken my side. Your side... How would you like... I wish I could... I don't have the strength. What strength? I have your kind words every day and your concern. You are cold, Pierre. Take it. - Oh no, you keep it. No, I don't want to. Besides, I'm no longer cold. You're blind? Yes, sir. May I examine her eyes? Come on... Don't be scared. You haven't been blind since birth? No, sir. Only for about two years. Who's that poking his oar in? You've never followed a course of treatment? Not yet. I came to Paris to... What do you want with this here child? I'm a doctor. - A doctor! - Doctor... By whom were you to be treated? - There's no cure. Who told you this? I don't know exactly... everyone. Sir, do you believe that she might be cured? Sir... Come over here with me a moment. I think I can cure that girl. All it'll take is one small operation. There's no point in telling her. I don't want to get her hopes up uselessly. Rest assured, I'll say nothing to her. One morning, bring her to me. To St Louis Hospital. To my consultancy. May the Good Lord bless you, and keep you in good health, good doctor. What did he say? He said... he was wrong to have intervened. There's no hope. My God... Wait... you said that we're always on the same streets so today we'll have a change of locale. I'm going to the bar. I need a snifter to warm my bones. The doctor could be mistaken. You must be brave. Hope. It's beautiful. What's it like? Describe it. There's a crib... With an ox. A small child on the straw. Jesus! I was never taught about this. I don't know about prayer. Repeat after me: [Recites Lord's Prayer] Very well, ladies... let's go! 1... 2... 1... 2... Good day, doctor. - Good day, sister. Is the Mother Superior here? - In the infirmary, doctor. Good day, Mother. - Good day, doctor. How are you? - Very well, thank you doctor. Shall we look at our patients? - Of course. How is this one? Improving? - Yes, doctor. Her fever has subsided. Splendid! Where is Marie Bochet? She passed yesterday evening. Poor girl... ...and I'd brought her grace. - Too late. I was so pleased to have obtained it for her. It wasn't God's will. Well, Henriette... Feeling better? - Thank you, doctor. No delirium? - This wasn't delirium, doctor... Come on, be brave, my girl. Oh Mother, it's not just me... I'm thinking of her. Doctor, I'm begging you. - I know, Sister Genevieve explained. What do you expect me to do? She's old enough to manage on her own. But she's blind, doctor. Blind? You didn't tell me this. When they detained me, I'd just found her again. I heard her voice. I saw her in the street. She was begging by singing. She was being led by a horrible woman. I want to run after her but they stopped me... Hold on. Blind? I remember an encounter with a young blind girl, blonde, with big blue eyes. - Oh yes! The woman who was with her called her... hold on... She called her Louise. - That's her! Moreover, I know the shrew who guided her. - You know her? Yes, I've seen her several times at the hospital. She's La Frochard. She lives in a hovel on Rue de Lourcine. For pete's sake, she must be recovered! Doctor, please, let me out of here! Come on child, calm down. I've already taken steps to secure your release. But it might be too late! She could disappear. I'll never see her again. Poor girl. If we could have his grace... - I don't know if I can obtain it. She's not guilty though. - Obviously. The thing is, she has some very powerful people against her. Do you have your visitors' register? - There it is. There must be some way... We have an order of grace. - What's that? Well, the one I gave to you. - Marie Bochet's grace? I don't understand. We'll substitute one detainee for another. The deceased was called Henriette Gerard and the innocent, the one we want to rescue, can leave here under the name of Marie Bochet. No, doctor. We couldn't do that. Even though it's the right thing to do. Oh no, it would be a serious lie. And I've never lied in my life. However Mother, I must say that there are occasions... No, doctor. You'll never obtain this from me. Very well... I respect your scruples. Only... - Never. Shame. It requires lying... and I can't. As you wish. I've signed the death certificate. What do you want? They've come for the detainees for deportation to the colonies. Already? - Yes, Mother. Where are they sending them? - To Guiana. Come on, move back. Good day, Mother Superior. Here's the order that brings me here. And here's the list of prisoners that must depart tonight for Le Havre. I hereby give notice for the removal of these prisoners, we will then check them against your records. Poor girl. You aren't going to allow that poor unfortunate to be sent to Guiana. You know what awaits her there. I have to do my duty, doctor. Jeanne Raymond. So be it, I'll find me a husband down there! Germaine Labattu. No, I'm not going. Henriette Gerard. Henriette Gerard. Where is she? Go and find her. - She's in there... Poor thing... Come on, Henriette Gerard. Deceased. Deceased? Deceased. That's the lot. Goodbye, Mother Superior. Let's go. My first lie. Your finest act of charity. Here's your grace, my child. You are free. Free? ...finally ...after ...180 days ...of journeying. The fairy... arrived... and said... to the little... peasant... now, Blondine... come down... At the same... moment... Blondine... ended up... in a... carriage... made of... pearls... and gold. I'm thirsty. Do you hear? - What's that? The wind in the trees. I'm cold. Read me the end of the story. In a... carriage... made of pearls... and gold. It only took them... five minutes... to arrive... at the palace... of the king. Pierre, I'm frightened! - Don't be. It's her. She's going to take me away. - Who? I don't want to. I'm frightened! There! Behind the door. No, nobody here. She's not there. Really? - Yes, really. Calm down now. Keep those covers on. You go to so much trouble for me. Listen Louise, know what we're going to do? We're going to elude them. Elude them? - Yes. - But how? If we leave together, we'll surely be taken. Therefore I'll leave first, like I'm going to work. You leave afterwards. Follow the wall on the right. It'll be dark. Nobody will see you. I'll wait at the corner and we can run away. But I don't have the strength. - Yes you do, Louise. I'll support you. But what if they stop you? What is my life worth? I'm going. Remember what you must do? See you soon, Louise. What if your mother locks the door? There's a spare key under the bench. See you shortly, Louise. Come in. What do you want? - Mrs. Frochard, please. What do you want with Mrs. Frochard? - I must speak with her. Is it just you? - Yes, I'm alone. - Come in. What do you have to say to Mrs. Frochard? That's me. I'm looking for the person living with you. Which person? - A young girl. A young girl? Don't know her. Then it seems I'm mistaken? - So it seems. However... I was informed the house is by the river. There are many houses by the river. You've been asking for alms with a blind girl? Why would a woman like me be asking for alms? I've two lads who work. One's a knife-grinder, here's his crank, and the other's over there in a bar. Then madam, I'll excuse myself. No harm done. Everyone makes mistakes. Goodbye, madam. Goodbye. That scarf! - What about it? I recognise that scarf you're wearing. It's hers! Not at all! It belongs to me! It's mine! You liar! I know it well, I gave it to her. Okay, okay... You're so overwrought I didn't dare tell you the truth. I discovered the girl you seek one evening on the street. Since I couldn't feed her, she suggested singing to buy her bread. "You aren't made for this sort of life", I told her. In fact, grief was consuming her. "Madam, I can sing no more", she told me. And it was true... three days ago,... the poor dear sang her last. She's dead! Hey, kiddo! Under the bench... Plus, you know, if she denounces us we could be deprived of our meal ticket. Don't worry, mother. I'll knock her block off. And if needs be, we can play real hardball. Now be off with you. Madam,... what have they done to you? Answer me. ??? What are you doing there? I was trying to... - Get back to your room! She shouldn't be left like this. - It's none of your business. Go on! But... - Will you go! Be off with you! I'm so happy. It's really you, isn't it? I've found you at last! My dear! My little sister! Oh, those rotten girls! - Don't worry, I'll sort them out. Poor little Louise! What a state I find you in! You wretches will answer for this! Come... You're not going anywhere. Lock her up there, that one. Shut up or else! - Let go of me! I told you to belt up! - Help! You're not taking her anywhere. I'll shut you up good and proper. Are you going to belt up? You're going to belt up. We're a family of killers. That's enough! What was that? - You're going to let them go. You've roused yourself. - You won't commit any more crimes. And who's going to stop me? - I will, I'm going to stop you. Leave it... you're too ridiculous. You no longer intimidate me. You beat up on women. You're a coward. Reall?... I'm just a coward?... Run for it, miss. Get out! Go on! My God, what are they doing to him? I'm frightened. Pierre, please... Run for it... run for it, will you? Happy now, eh? I'm anything but a coward... And now the coward will finish you off! Go on, go now. What about you, Pierre? Fly quickly before they come. But what will become of you? Don't worry about me. Farewell, Louise. Where are we going? - To the doctor. Mummy! Jesus Christ dressed like the poor Give him some charity Some crumbs off your table Would make a nice dinner for me. The crumbs off our table Our dogs know how to eat them... Quiet, can't you see? Can't you see he's sleeping? He's sleeping... He's sleeping... And what are you doing there? Blood! Take him away! What happened here? Did you see? He's his brother... they had a fight. He stabbed him with a knife. Have you any news? - Yes, that young girl is out of prison. She had her grace? - Yes. We obtained by a strategy that will perhaps be uncovered. Therefore it's essential this situation is sorted out. What are you going to do? - I've decided to try an experiment. It's highly risky but it might work. Everything depends on your husband. I've brought Henriette here with her sister. But my husband... - You well know that your husband is a great man. He won't be able to resist their pleadings. It won't work... - Let me try, madam. Inform the Count that the Countess wants to speak with him. Yes, the doctor is correct. There can be no delay. We must risk all to win all. She's my daughter. This is her... she'll plead her sister's case to your husband. He won't be able to refuse her. Say something to her, madam, to give her courage. Madam. Help me in front of the Count. I want so much to win grace for my sister. Yes, we'll win it, my girl. We'll win it. Come here, my child. The Lieutenant General of Police is here. Speak to him. What is it? What's this about? Sir, I beg you. My sister is innocent. Grant me your grace, she's done nothing. I swear to you. You would make us so happy. I don't understand. Who? It must be you, doctor, who organised this little plot. She has suffered enough. Sir... Very well, I agree. However on one condition... That they both leave and I hear no more about them. My Lord, we're departing. We'll return to our region. But Henriette... My duty is to devote my life to her. To her alone. We must separate. - You can't do this, Henriette. It must be. You'll never see us again. Come along, Louise. Don't go! What's the matter with you? - I don't want her to go. Madam, listen to me. Let us return to the countryside we know. We should never have left it. No, you can't go. It's not possible. But we've been so unhappy in Paris. But now you have someone to cherish you, you'll be happy. Poor girl... How she's suffered. You must find the cure, doctor, achieve the impossible. I'll take her to the hospital. - No. You'll treat her here. How happy I am, madam. Call her "mummy". Mummy! Mummy! - Yes, mummy. I am your mummy... My little darling mummy. My mummy. If only I could see you... But you will see her, I've made it my business. Can you? - I'll cure her, madam. And God will heal her.
