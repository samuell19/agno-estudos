Put a shirt on. I don't want her to see your scars. It's not my weekend. You think I don't know about his scars? Who do you think cleans them up when you're not around and distracts him so he doesn't cut himself to death? I'm hungry. I made pancakes this morning. I need you to watch her. She's up for a lead in a movie. A western. Westerns are for white people. If she can be my mom, she can play anyone. You should be supportive. Bring these upstairs and give this one to Miss Belichnikof. You can eat with her. Knock several times. Her hearing is worse now. I'm doing this for her, not you. You look good. I told you, I have an audition. I'm not watching her on your weekend so you can go on a date. It's not a date. You figure if they want to nail you, you'll get the part? This is why I hate you. Why'd you come over? -I came-- -To get your fix? So you could get that freshly fucked look? I came over so you could watch her. Should we do it here? I'll move the pancakes. Why is it so important to you to make me feel like shit? -I'll watch her. -Mm-hmm. -Okay? -Mm-hmm. I'll watch her. And don't make her see you do that. Have you asked me how I'm doing for a change? How you doing? I want to go get ice cream. Fine. That's it? Fine? You want an argument? I want something. At least Mom tries to engage me, you just follow me around trying to erase all traces of my existence. There's no ice cream in here. Keeping it cool for my dad. Hey! Misha's no dad. He just knocked up a hot white girl and made you. That's actually the biological definition of being a dad. Does he pick you up from school? Ever ask you how you're doing? Misha's no father. He can change. Even my sister knew he couldn't raise you. Why do you think she adopted you? She always has a soft spot for lost causes. Why is it so important to you that I hate myself? Hating ourselves is what fuels us to be great. Why do you think your dad's invincible? Nothing anyone can do to him is worse than what he does to himself. Wanna see the dance I'm doing for the school show in the fall? -No dancing. -I got a solo. Okay, so it ends like this. Watch. - Teach me that. - I can't teach it. You can either do them or you can't. Do it again. I came to pick up Brooklyn. I don't have time for this. No. We were up late watching a movie. Let her sleep. I hate you. And me. For wanting this. I'm not such a bad guy. But I need more than this. There is nothing more. There is when you dance. I don't dance. I'm not gay. Just do it fast and come. Wait, wait, wait. I want your ass. You know there's no anal from me. Ever. Maybe you are gay. - Don't. - Why? Are you gay, fighter man? I'm not gay! You can't go five minutes without triggering him? Just being alive triggers him. No weakness. That's why you're drawn to me. And that's why I left you.

That is the prescription. To go see Dr. Maxi Casper. - For medicine? - For psychoanalysis. A shrink? Absolutely not. And this-- this address. Fire Island. Is this a joke? She's retired. She lives there now. They're all gay there. I can't go there. Then I can't help you. Then send in a new doctor. I did. Dr. Casper. Go see Dr. Casper. And by the way, I put a note in your file so no pharmacy will fill your prescription. The open house is over. I'm looking for Dr. Casper. Number five. There's no house numbers here. Aren't you supposed to be a woman? It says "Maxine." I call it the hall of mirrors. I'm not letting you examine me here. Take me to your office. Here we examine ourselves.

The way I felt with Sergei... my ballet teacher, be-- before he... Sell me this house. It's not for sale. The sign outside said it was. It's for sale only to a gay man who stands for what we believe in. I am gay. But still in the closet? I'm afraid that's worse. Name your price. You said you came here for treatment, not to buy a house. I don't need treatment.

For us, Fire Island is like America was to the pilgrims. Or the millions of other immigrants that nobody wanted. A place to be ourselves where we can live as we believe out in the open. Though you talk of money, your life is a lie. I'm afraid my answer's still no. Then why show me this? Why make me want it? That's a question for a psychiatrist, not a gay man selling a house. But you are a psychiatrist. Dr. Rubin sent me here. You? You're Dr. Maxine Casper? Everybody calls me Maxi. Misha and Maxi. M&M. Fate has a sense of humor sometimes. This can't be right. You're the psychiatrist, not... her. You're wearing too many clothes for Fire Island. What are you hiding? I'm not like you. You're like you think I am. Hiding in disguise in women's clothing. I need this house. I need what you've created. What we've created is a way of life, not just a house. I'm willing to live that life. Then I'll make you an offer. I'll rent you the house for the summer while Maxi treats you. I need to own it. You have until Labor Day. If with Maxi's help by the end of the summer you convince my neighbors you can live an open, honest life as a gay man, then, and only then... I will sell you the house. If I'm living as an openly gay man by Labor Day, you'll sell me the house? You can move in full-time for the summer next weekend after Maxi and I move to our new house. Full-time? It's the only way to join the community. To see if you can become part of our fabric. Fine. Next weekend. That was quite a performance. I've gotta have it. It's like... coming home to a place I've never been before. Well, the heart does want what it wants. I had a mentor who once said, "We all have a sacred space, the one place where we are truly alive." Some of us never find it. Of course, his sacred space was a basement laundry room on East 93rd Street, but that's another story. You talk a lot for a shrink. My sacred space is inside my patient's thoughts. Even when those thoughts are lies. We can meet three times a week. And you've got to wear more appropriate attire. Show some skin. I want to see those scars. And maybe then I'll write you that prescription you want. I'm Rush. I'm one of the neighbors. Mr. Osbourne said we were supposed to come over to judge you-- I mean, welcome you. - It's not ready. - Oh, sure looks ready. Oh, it tastes ready, too. I mean, I'm getting so hungry these days. It's like I'm going through a second childhood. Except I never finished the first one. You're staining the tablecloth. Stains are a good thing and that's why God invented stain remover. Stain remover doesn't work. It does if you use my secret ingredient. I'll bring you over a bottle after we finish our rehearsals. - Rehearsals for what? - Smells good. I need something in my mouth right away. What you need I don't have time to give you, but I need a drink to wake up. Rehearsal for what? Are you the new guy? From Queens? - The Bronx. - You sure? Mr. Osbourne said Queens. You want a drink? I need a drink, like, five minutes ago. Hey. No, absolutely not. No ma'am. No ma'am. Go put something on. He also said you're a dancer. Fighter. Uh, try to contain the mess. No, he definitely said a dancer. Oh, that's see through. Um, do you have any coffee for Mr. Fahrenheit here? - He needs something to wake up. - Shoes. Fahrenheit, get your feet off the table. Oh, don't waste your breath on him. He has a massive hangover. You see how he always uses the word "massive" to refer to me. We should sit down and eat. I will help you clean it. We will return it to its virgin state. Sit down, Queens. One of these will make you forget all your troubles. Make sure you compliment him. You'll have a friend for life. Welcome to Fire Island. No extra virgins allowed. Let's go, it's rehearsal time. Mm-mm. Not here. Mr. O always lets us rehearse here. He said you were trying to fit in, so why are you questioning us? Not here, no dancing. Every Labor Day weekend there's this contest down at the docks and this is the year we're finally gonna win. Here.

If you join us, we can finally win. - I don't dance. - You just did. You were doing it wrong. And you just had to correct it because your gay ass couldn't stand to see it performed wrong. I don't dance. You imitate someone who does pretty well though. Why does it matter? Ever since grade school, I was always the fat, ugly kid who never won. Ew. With you, we can actually win this thing. And those queens on the Fire Island Crew will finally have to suck my dick for a change. I thought Mr. Fahrenheit sucked your dick. That bitch? He can't give head for shit. The pretty ones never can. I just pay him to hang around so people think that I can get a boy like that. Yeah, he uses me to compensate for his shortcomings. And believe me, they're short. You're gonna dance, Queens, and make us win that contest. -We do need you. -For what? To win. Why does a contest matter so much? When you want something for 20 years, you feel like there's something wrong with you if you never get it. Harder. Oh, you're training like a pussy today. Or like a little girl named Brooklyn. I'm quitting. You might as well quit breathing. - Continue. - I'm quitting. Continue. You're gonna quit on me like everyone quits on you? I got you the pills. Didn't you see 'em?

You know, like, if this is the premise for a movie where the father takes his daughter to Fire Island to reveal to her that he's gay. I'm not gay. I know. I've seen you with mom. I mean, not seen you, but you know what I mean. -Can you keep a secret? -Me? Are you really asking that? I need you to pretend I am gay. What? Just while we're on Fire Island. Oh, my God. This is like a movie. Except it's a bad movie. I don't think I want to know the answer to this, but why do I have to pretend you're gay? So I can buy a house. How is being gay gonna get you a house? This makes no sense, even for you. The guy won't sell to me unless I'm gay. He gave me until Labor Day to prove that I am. So you're gonna pretend to be gay to get a house? Wait 'til you see the house and the hall of mirrors. What's in it for me? A summer on Fire Island. I want a summer in New York City with my friends. How about, um, me not murdering you? I'll tell you what I do want. In exchange for me pretending that you, the straightest man I ever met, is gay... you're gonna teach me to do a pirouette. No. Fine. I'll teach it, but I can't make you learn it. You'll find a way. That's why they made you a dad. And I can teach you to be gay. I don't need your help. - Says who? - Me. I bought a new hat.

Our time is up. -I'll see you on Friday. -No, no, I did what you asked. -I answered your questions. -Yes. We made progress and we'll continue on Friday. You can't expect me to feel like this until Friday. Oh? Like you didn't get to come? I'd like to be gay. I could kiss a girl. -This is important. -Being gay? How I've been living in the closet and you only just now found out. So does it bother you that I'd be gay or that I'd pretend to be gay? Both. Neither. Just stick with the program. Please. What have you done? You've ruined them. Now I have to start all over. Dad, it's fine. I'll eat them. You know, you can't pour the syrup directly on the pancake stack. Only once the pancakes have been transferred to your plate. Sorry, I've been living with a normal person. It slipped my mind. Good morning all. I baked croissants. Not actually from scratch. And I actually used the microwave... but you've got to try them. -Who are you? -I'm Brooklyn. And that's my dad, Misha. -He's gay. -Is he? You're basically exactly his type. Oh, how long are you with us? All summer. This is perfect. He does make a mean pancake. No, about you being here. My nephew Carey's coming out this weekend. Now he'll have someone to play with. How old is this Carey? He's 16 and gorgeous. Oh, that is perfect. Yeah, my dad was just telling me that he loved to see me with an older boy. You know, so I can learn about sex and all that. Oh, oh, there. Oh, this is perfect. Look at that! Misha, Misha, it's like the cover of a magazine. Plus the syrup is all soaked in. Dad loves his syrup soaked in. Right, Dad? I'll be right back. Don't worry about it. He'll forgive you. I think he likes you. These are ruined now. Why do you say that? You can only put the syrup on the pancakes after they're on your plate. It's one of my dad's rules. About him liking me. He told me on the ferry. Interesting. He didn't say your name, but I know it was you. Anyone wanna go to the beach? Who's that? It's our turn, we need to make them leave. It's them. Going along on purpose. I-- -Who? -Our nemesis. The Fire Island Crew. They've won the past five years. No, now. The rules are we can't watch another group's rehearsal 'til the day of the show. But it's our time for the studio. They're doing this on purpose to taunt you. So let's taunt them. Hey! We have no choice. That's my dad for you. All testosterone. I love it! What's the matter with Misha? Looks like he's seen a man with two penises. I met a man like that once. The fuck you have. What's wrong with your dad? You don't want to know. I'm guessing he knows him. This is gonna be good. Should we do something? Just stand back. That was awesome. You really can dance! I mean, until the end, of-- of course. Well, that was rude. You really don't understand men, do you? He just lost. I shouldn't have said anything, should I? -Oh, boy. -I screwed that up. I wouldn't worry about it. Is he always like this after he loses? Pouty, but then he cheers up? I don't know. Never seen him lose at anything. I knew you were in the closet. I can smell it. Guys like you are easy to spot. You can't touch me, Frank. I just did, Gene Kelly. And I'm gonna beat you in the cage, too, in our upcoming rematch. I'm done fighting. You're gonna take up dancing full-time? I'm-- At a loss for words? Losing seems to be contagious for you now. I'll see you in the cage, Baryshnikov. Flat on your back. So you want me to go back to cutting? I want you to see what you're made of. If you have to cut yourself apart to do it, then so be it. Get back up, do it again. I want you to figure out how to reach me. -How to fix me. -That's the trick, isn't it? Any suggestions? You're the worst teacher I've ever seen. Can't you help me? Getting up is part of learning. Watch. You need to look at the same spot on each turn. Well, sure, it looks easy when you do it. Try it again. You're supposed to make suggestions to me. I can't fix myself. That's the only thing you can do. You're a terrible teacher. -You can't quit. -I'm not quitting. I'm leaving you alone to figure out how to teach, how to be a father. I should have just stayed at home. By now, I could have straightened the entire house. You know as well as I do this is no place to be straight. You need to come down to the beach. We saved a spot for you. I need to straighten up first. Get rid of all this dirt. Oh, yes, that would drive me crazy, too. My secret mix works well, doesn't it? It's the one thing I inherited from my father. He didn't leave me a cent, but I got his secret cleaning recipe. What is in it? I'll have to die first. And believe me, you don't wanna know. My dad died when I was six. Do you know why they call me Rush? Isn't that your name? My name is Steven. But everyone calls me Rush. After Rush Limbaugh. Because I have a couple Republican ideas. Since college. So for 20 years I've been Rush. You want me to call you Steven? Only if I can trust you. You should never trust me. Why not? I'm a man. Do you really believe that? Only men would bash each other's brains in and call that a living or entertainment. Only men would dance with the beauty and the grace of gods and call that entertainment. We see men differently. You see one side of men... I see the other. Can you hold me loose enough so that I can spin? Can you do that? -What the hell are you doing? -What you asked. I didn't ask you to try to get to second base. We haven't even kissed and you go straight for my breasts? What the hell was that? Well, you know, now we've been to first base. I like you, Carey. Don't ruin it. Uh, uh, sorry, I just-- I was just leaving. Step away from her. -Dad, it's nothing-- -Close your eyes. Not you. Brooklyn. - Close your eyes. - What? Close your eyes now. Stand up straight. Take off your flip flops. -First position. -What? First position. Now, prepare... and turn. Can I open my eyes? When you've done a complete turn. How will I know that? You'll just know. -You did it. -I did it. Dad, I-- Dad? He's gone. I did it. Now I just have to learn how to do it with my eyes open. Close 'em again. You are so dead now! Oh, my God. Get out of here. Mom! You look like a star. Not yet. Wait here, I'm gonna go put on my new suit so you can see how tan I am now. You look relaxed, Misha. - So do you. - Mm. I mean, you look good. Look at this suit and at my tan. Don't I look fabulous? You look amazing. Fire Island looks good on both of you. It's actually not as bad as I thought. But you should probably know that Dad's gay now. What are you talking about? He's finally out of the closet. Brooke. Now's not the time for joking around. - Who's joking? - Well, hello there. Who do we have here? I'm Vera. You are? I'm Rush. I was just telling Mom about how Dad's out of the closet now. She didn't know? You didn't know? Know what? Why don't we go down to the beach, Brooklyn? What's going on, Misha? Um, trying to fit in. As a gay man? Why don't we make a detour to the bedroom and I'll show you who's gay? Mm. There's the same old Misha. No foreplay. No talking. Just boom. Right to fucking. That used to be how we'd say hello. You know, how I got past your defenses... saw the real you. This is the real me. You like? Why don't you go down to the beach with your daughter and I'll get out of these... and I'll come meet you there. Why are you pretending to be gay? Mm. And how does a straight MMA fighter make such good pancakes? Who's a straight fighter? - Who are you? - And what the hell do pancakes have to do with being straight or gay? Who are you? Who are you? And what are you doing here? I'm Vera, Brooklyn's mom and Misha's ex-girlfriend. You're Brooklyn's mom? When her birth mom left her with Misha, he barely knew a diaper from a condom so I adopted her. You're a more generous person than I'd ever be. I'm Pablo. You're wearing my bikini. Your bikini? Listen, I paid good money for-- You're Pablo Garcia? -The swimwear designer? -Mm. This is your bikini. -You wear that for Misha? -God no. I wore it as a reward for finally getting a film. - Yes! - Thank you. How do you know him? Oh, mostly through his pancakes. -Hmm. -What should I know about him? Well, anyone that makes pancakes this good can't be all that bad, right? Well, that's what I thought when I saw him dance. - He danced for you? - Mm. Did I take the train to Oz? Most people do come here looking for something. Why are you here? I guess I wanted to know if it was worth it. To be a star? To be wanted. When he wants you, it's like nothing else in the world matters. It's intoxicating. It's because he's a winner. Makes you feel like you've won. -It's more than that. -Oh, yeah? With Misha, it's-- it's like he's 13 years old again. Like his entire existence depends on getting what he wants. So, if you're what he wants, it's like you hold the power of life and death over him. Oh! Why'd you come out here then? It's like a drug. I came to see Brooklyn and I'm all sandy. -I don't want to have sex. -Bullshit. Well, Rush is already getting addicted. Oh, my God. You came to get laid, I can see it in your eyes. I came to see my daughter. Pass the syrup, will you? These pancakes are stupid good, oh, my God. She's not even your real daughter. What did you say? You know what I meant. Maybe you should have sex with Rush. He seems ready to offer up his ass. -I'm not gay. -Right. Then what the hell are you doing, Misha? I'm figuring out my life. I'm gonna tell them what you're doing, -who you are. -Not one word. Get your hands off me. You can't tell them. What's going on? -We're leaving. -I'm staying. You're coming to the city with me. Mom, please. Dad? Let her stay. I need her. So you can continue your charade? -Go back to your movie. -Brooklyn. I'll make it work. I want him to make it work.

I make a breakthrough and that's your response? A breakthrough? Sweetie, you've barely scratched the surface. Just like you do when you cut. You call this surface? I call it an attempt to distract you from your secret. I don't have a secret. That's why you're so angry. Because you can keep a secret and she can't. You can inflict any amount of pain rather than reveal your precious little skeleton. I'm not gay. You're on Fire Island pretending to be a gay man. So I can buy a house! One that finally feels like home. A home that only a gay man would want. Will you keep it all neat and tidy and make Martha Stewart pancakes like a cute little gay man? -I'm not gay! -Prove it. Hit me, Misha. Hit me like a straight man. I don't hit women. But I'm not a woman, am I? You're-- Say it, Misha. Say what I am. A washed up drag queen? Oh, now, you can do better than that. You're a fake. A lie. You're a man wearing a dress. This is a crop top and shorts. Spoken like a true queen. But not a lying, scared shitless queen from the Bronx who'd do anything to avoid the truth. August 30. That's a week before Labor Day. Is that a problem? I told you I'm not training during the summer. Pick a later date. That would be a sign of weakness. You'll do as I say. I can't and I won't. Postpone it, Skeeter. You need money to buy this house of yours, your dream house? I have money from the last time I kicked Frank's ass. You are misinformed. How am I misinformed? How am I... misinformed? I used that money to book your rematch on August 30. Why do you let him control you? What does he have on you? I need to know what to do, not... figure out what's inside of me. What the hell was that for? Sure looked to me like you needed to cool off. -You're crazy. -I'm crazy? What do you want to do, Misha? Beat Frank Diamond. Spoken like a man who can't ever make an honest choice. - That is a choice. - A choice from a man who cuts himself to see if he's still alive. I haven't cut myself all summer. Except last night after you saw Skeeter. How do you know that? What do you call what you were doing by the beach? Hope you enjoy spending the rest of your summer by yourself. Take your hat off, Misha. And you let him rule you, because he's the one person alive who knows your secret. You don't know anything about him. He was there for me when nobody else was. You betrayed me? No, you betrayed you. I'm saving you. What do you want, Misha? To beat Frank Diamond. To beat all of them. Then I can't help you. -Go follow her. -Why? Because, my dear idiot child, she wants you to. Yeah, you don't know that. I know more about love than you do. And don't come back here until you're ready to face the one opponent you can't beat. I won't ever be back here. This is my last fight. For you or anyone else. Is the commotion finally over? I got a headache. And the last thing I need is this puppy love subplot. No, don't sit down. We need to move these chairs. -Uh-huh. -You promised you'd help. There better be a strong drink at the end of this. I only hope I'm as lucky with her dad as Carey is with her. It's a mistake. He's a good person. I can sense that. And I'm gonna have him and I'm gonna prove all you doubters wrong. Moving the chairs is a mistake and anyone can see he's straight. Have you seen his ass? Yeah. Don't call my future husband straight. Even Brooklyn was trying to tell you he's not gay. She was not. She said things are not always as they seem. But can you lift? Don't scratch the floor! Well, this one's broken, so I don't know what you want me to do about it. And if he's straight, then what is he doing here? Rush? At your service. I need to pack. I'm going back to the city. I don't have time for this. I brought some body oil for you. Get up, you're getting oil all over the seat. Stop it, Rush. I'm not taking no from you any longer. -Stop it. -Tonight, you belong to me. These are ruined, you got oil all over the pillows. Misha. I'm right here. You see. You feel the passion between us. The way you make me feel. What did you say? You make me feel this way. - Take it back. - What? Take it back. I didn't make you love me. Take it back! Stop it, Misha. What, isn't this what you wanted? Let's go to bed, hmm? You can take me there however you want. Get up and fight me like a man. Get up! Help me. I am helping you. I'm teaching you to take it like a man, like I did. Please. - I'm sorry. - What? I'm sorry. You should have been sorry all those years ago. I hate you. You're gonna clean that up. No, I'm not. I'm going back to Fire Island with or without you. Where are you gonna stay? With Rush and Carey. Please. At least Carey says he loves me. You never say that. I'll have to call Mom. She's on a movie. Why do you have to ruin her dreams, too? -Help me clean this up. -Be my father. -I am. -Then live as a gay man. I'm not gay, Brooklyn! You could pretend. How am I supposed to get Mom to love you now? What are you talking about? Why do you think I wanted you to teach me that pirouette? To show Mom that if I could tame you, then maybe she could too and we could be a family again.

You're gonna go be a big movie star now, you don't need me. I needed you to be a father. She needs that. What am I supposed to do now? Let yourself outta your cage. You used to be just like me. That's why, despite everything... I thought we could build something together. But I can't keep picking at the same scars forever like you do. I'll still find them. You're the only one who could. The only one I let know what my father did to me. And I loved you for that. You deserve more than a cage. I love you. Doesn't that matter? What do you know about loving? You can't love someone, if you can't even stand being yourself. What kind of doctor are you? I'm asking for your help. What's in it for me? -Oh, you want money? -I have all the money I need. Then what do you want? Whatever it is, I'll do it. I want you to say no to me. To tell me to go fuck myself, to tell me that our relationship is all about you, that my job is to help you. You said I focused too much on me and not on you. Misha, the whole point of seeing a psychiatrist is to focus on your needs... but you allowed me to turn it on its head. Let me force you to have sessions doing yoga, to rearrange my bookshelf for me, and even now, you offer to do anything that I want, as long as I'll help you. As long as I do my damn job.

He raped me. Skeeter? Sergei. Your dance teacher. It wasn't rape. He was like a father to you. It wasn't rape. Because you're gay? I was gay. Just what we need. Another cliché. He didn't rape me. Because you turned him on? You seduced him. Beautiful muscular Misha. You danced for him and you seduced him. And you made him fuck you. What did you want me to do? He's still inside you, isn't he? And now everyone's laughing at you for having his cock up your ass. For wanting his cock up your ass. Skeeter gave me this. Taught me how to fight... so that no one could get the best of me again. And now no one gets to see the best of you, do they? I need to know how to be straight. How to cut him... out of me. Do you know why I wore this, Misha? Because it turns you on? I wore it for you. They don't know what it was like. He was so proud of me. Hmm, I see it. When you let yourself be a father... and when you dance... when you stop being a victim and become someone who chooses who he wants to be... who he wants to fuck. I'd give anything to find that person again.
