October 2019, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk (GB). Three months before Brexit. Once an idyllic beach holiday destination for the English working class, the city is now one of the poorest in the UK. Provisional Figures is the name used in statistics to classify all immigrants whose situation and status is undefined or provisional and who are currently working in the United Kingdom. Behind the Golden Mile and all the lights and amusements glaring on the promenade, there's a vast inland salt marsh. It's a stark place, but really beautiful. On those marshes, there's a bird reserve where I used to live and work. There we used to pump water onto the land to create habitat for the waders migrating in the spring and autumn. And in the summer, we used to take groups of people around pointing out birds, plants, anything of interest, really. I keep having this dream. Where I wake up in bed to the sound of a ring of magpies fighting outside the caravan on the marshes. Like children in the school playground... I go out to look. It's still dark. And one of the birds looks at me and says, 'Hey man... 'Hey man... 'Are you awake? Are you awake?' Fucking birds... I feel like they're nesting on my head. In this lesson you can learn how to use English in common hotel situations. Assuredly I can install more Portuguese workers for very little money. Very comfortable rooms... many, many workers. I can install comfort... comfortably. Comfortably. - Comfortably. - Comfortably... Comfortably... Comf... Richie? Wake up. It's time. We got work to do. You go on without me.

We are a little bit concerned about the workers' conditions. Yes, we need to make sure we stick to the rules. This is really strict. We can't do... We can't do it as a business. We gonna end up having massive, massive problems if you're gonna do this. We just wanna make sure we deliver to the costumer... No problem. I provide the rooms and I can comfortably install them. I take care of the workers. I take care of the workers, I... comfortably install them in good amenities with a view for sea front. I help with paperwork and... I keep a close eye. You know, I take care of them as I would take care of my own children. And they call me Mother. The Portuguese workers are better workers than the gypsies you bring here. Yeah, but the gypsies don't complain about their breaks. We've got in the business set break... How many you've got? Like, 3 breaks. Each break is a 15-minute. Gypsies don't complain because gypsies can't speak a word of English. So give me a number. Is it 30, 40, 80? 100? I haven't slept a wink all week. All night long, so much noise... Everybody making noise. I haven't slept a fucking wink. That soup smells good. - It does, I hope it's tasty. - Yes, you need to eat. Does your room have three beds? For God's sake, are they fucking with me? I haven't slept at all this week, it's like we're living in barracks, three to a room... We work our arses off, and she doesn't help with shit! Nobody says anything, everyone keeps their mouth shut. Let's talk to everyone else, let's get together... Cardoso, open up. Your husband came by again. Won't leave me alone. Fucking addict. 'Oy Raúl, Raúl? 'Raúl? 'You be a good boy. You be a good boy. You give me a tip. Give me a tip, Raúl.' And I just made it up. 'Molly, trap 5, race 7. 'Speedy Bullets, trap 6, race 9. 'Sure win. Sure win, Richie.' He owes everyone money. He might lose the hotels. You have to talk to him, Tat. Fleecing the Portuguese isn't my thing. I don't want to lose this job. I got your 400 to give you, baby. What did they say about new workers? They need more workers. - How many? - Many. - How many? - Many. Many workers. They must have given you a number. Many for Christmas campaign. They did not give a number. Right. Stick them in The Ambassador. Lots of space there. Three to a room. Don't be so fucking soft on them. Right? - Well, they work hard. - Hard? - Yeah. - Like Cardoso? The one that can walk and can't work? Why is he still here, Tat? Do you want me to tell you? Disabilities. Gonna rip the fucking government off like the rest of them. Where do you think you gonna get the money for your refurbishment rooms for your senior citizens, babe? Christmas campaign is coming. We can't be having Pork and Cheese in our rooms without paying, right? I know they call you Mother but you can't be too soft on them. Don't fuck up our little business, sweetie. - You know I love you. - Yeah. Sure. You're a star, babe. Don't blow this opportunity. Fucking Cardoso is still not paying. Give him a few more days, he cut himself on the deboning. Show me the 'refurnishments'. How much more do we need, Tat? We're almost there, love. It'll look like that. Super cute for the old people. It'll be like on TV. Refurbishments. 'Refurmishments.' Refurbishments. - Isn't that what I said? - No. Refurbish-ments. Since you have such a high standing, you could help me out, maybe? So I get my life back on track. Give me more hours. They need everyone they can get, the English won't touch the turkeys. - They are launching new products. - Until I get my life back on track. You know I haven't missed work. I know, Vítor. I get up at 3, 3:30 a.m. to catch the bus. I've never missed a day's work, so... For a week, I waited for the bus to go to work. But... every time they'd tell me the bus was full. 'It's full, it's not possible to take me for job.' It's... it's about my life, right? You already owe me two weeks, Paulo. Now that you got your payslip, you can pay for the bus too. Here's your card. What about the room?! Can't you see? There are three of us. Is this a beehive, or what? There's nothing better at this price. At this price? I could buy a tent, I'll go to... - You do that, love. - I'll buy a tent. Fifty quid. You should get a job, Mia. You got a baby. You keep thinking of yourself. She told me to fuck off and go home and not to come back again. Say: 'Mommy lazy. Mommy's lazy.' You're lazy. Can't you just go down and tell Linda that I was just being an idiot? No, 'cause she hates me! Well, she hates me! Nothing for me, your sausages are shit. I'm just telling you now. - Hi, Syd. - You OK? - Yeah. You? - I'm alright, thanks. You? - How have you 'bean'? - My beans? The beans are lovely. - Beans? - No, not "beans". How've you been... Yeah.

He says he pays tonight. - Tonight? - Yeah. I'm going back there tonight. Well, money's too tight to mention, Tat. So make sure he does, right? Granddad and Felix gonna bop him on the nose. Where's our money? Where's our money? You do it. Go on, you do it! We can provide a very large room with cooking area. Cooking area... Worries about damp, worries about the sheets. About conditions. Door is not shutting properly, windows are not shutting properly. It's fucking dreadful. I wouldn't put my fucking dogs in some of them rooms, Tat. You know, I just work for you guys, but... surely you can see how shit it's getting up there. It's this shit every night, I don't need it. No wonder people are refusing to pay, Tat. - He still hasn't left the room? - Not since this morning. But hey, that's alright. Don't go hatin' on each other. I've come and he's fuckin' getting me in the ear. I get it in the ear. I've gotta give it to you in the ear. And if Richard's here I'll fuckin' tell him. Good morning, Mother. Cardoso. I have your passport here. You need to split. For God's sake, get the fuck out of here. You know I need this job. Give me just a few more days, Mother. I'm almost well. Good morning.

They'll take care of you properly. I'll put it here. It's in your pocket, don't forget. It's in your pocket. Don't stop breathing. That's right, love. We're taking you home. You're going home, Cardoso. Cardoso's going home, Cardoso's going home... What are you doing, Tat? Is he still breathing? Just a minute! C'mon baby, we're waiting! Do you remember that little Brazilian monkey my dad gave me? I used to walk up and down the front there with him on my shoulder and all them tourists would stop me for photos? Right? Right? So, anyway. I'm telling a story here! So anyway... Well, this one day, right? This family stops me and they want a photo of their baby in the pram, so... I get the monkey, I put it with the baby in the pram... The monkey... It just shits all over the kid. It's all over his head, it's on his fucking eyes... Spank the monkey! - Dad, do you remember that monkey? - Round and round. Stop it! Don't. - Sing us a song, Tat. - No. Tat's gonna sing a song! Tat! Tat! Tat! Hi! I would like to make a reservation for a very long stay. Do you have adjoining rooms with a sea view? What did he say? I don't want to work in the hotels with you anymore. It's over. I'm not cut out for it. One more Christmas and we're done. We'll do a proper refurbishment. With a new boiler. Air conditioning. Then we'll fill the place with old people. In the daytime we'll have line dancing, bingo, and karaoke in the evening. From March, we'll be working flat out. He couldn't pay. He was injured. It will look like this. Let's leave this place, Tat. If your husband finds out you've been stealing from him, we're fucked. Let's go back to Portugal. This has run its course. You want to be like them, but they don't give a fuck about you. The hotels are going to look beautiful. Beautiful rooms with sea view. You'll even learn line dancing. NOVEMBER There was hardly any foreigners here when I was a kid. Except these two black guys, Paul and Bran. I used to play football with 'em. They were fine guys. Don't forget why you're here, sweetie. You should do the refurbishment on The Ocean Bride. And do your bingo nights with your senior citizens. Very large room. Very large room. Adjoining rooms. - Very large room. - Very large room. Very large... Very large room. Adjoining rooms.

No, we just see them walking around on the promenade. Hello! Welcome to Great Yarmouth. Here's your hotel. We hope you have a lovely stay. We're taking you on the horses and carriages tomorrow. - Thank you. - Along the sea front... Dinner tonight... line dancing in the morning. OK? Maintain one forward. So it's: one, forward. Cha-cha-cha. One and cha-cha-cha. Love, we have to clean the downstairs rooms too. The rooms stink of fucking shit. Rub some Vicks on your nose, it helps. I'm Mother to the Portuguese. Hi, Tânia. Mother to the Portuguese. Please fill in those forms. We've got the hanging, we've got the deboning and we've got the trimming. It's not nice, it's not pleasant but it's work. So, in the factory we have... four working areas for you. Hanging: hanging up the turkey. Deboning: deboning the animals. Trimming: cutting off the animals. You must work hard and then pay rent. Now, you need to advance the money for the room and the bus, for the first week. The factory will decide the number of hours and when you work each week. At the end of each week you'll get a piece of paper called a payslip. The payslip will show the hours you worked that week and the amount you are to be paid. Lastly, I'm going to take your passports and put them in a safe place. When you go back to Portugal I'll give them back. If we're sharing rooms, there's no privacy. Will I have my own bathroom or not? You're saying we'll have to share rooms. In Portugal we were told we'd share houses. To work one hour, we have to pay £25 for the bus and £55 for the room. How will we eat? It's three per room. Hi, Marisa. Edson! Room 105, at the end. Do you need anything? She got car sick. Is she your wife? - The room stinks. - I'll see what I can do. Carmo, you're back. Tânia, I wanted to ask you, please could you ask at Roberto to give me a job that's less... Not so demanding, because ever since my accident my legs give out. I don't know what's wrong with me, it's really serious. Sometimes I fall down, I lost strength. If you can please talk with them. - EV is all right. - Then you'll stay on EV. But you'll work standing up. Boy! Boy! Boy! Hey boy! Didn't I tell you the Portuguese need to stay in their rooms? What is it? Have you been drinking? Why are you out so late? I wasn't clubbing. I was looking for my brother. Your brother's here? Yes, he works at the turkeys. He's staying at a hotel nearby. António Cardoso. Which hotel? If I knew, I wouldn't be looking for him. And do you think you're going to find him at this hour? Do me a favour, go to sleep. Go back to your room. You'll go to work tomorrow and find your brother soon enough. - Yeah? - Right. Tânia? Thanks for helping out the Portuguese. Look, Richie. They do like this. That was great. That was weird. Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, monkey boy! You gotta go! Now you're their little clown? C'mon! No one does it like you, man! C'mon! Show us your stage work, let's do it. C'mon, do us that trick! Wakey-wakey! We ain't got all day! Go on, wake up!

Go on, get your clothes, get wrapped up, it's cold out! They should put the younger ones on those jobs. They told us we'd be working in the packaging section. And it wasn't. - Alright, Chico? - Everything OK, Tânia? You alright? Come here. If I catch you stealing again I'll kick you out, yeah? We were starving. We all are. What are you looking at? Let's go, folks. One hour to the plant. I can't stand the smell in there. Come on darling, they don't like employees who step out of the line. Get back in the line, yeah? Otherwise you'll get a warning. Come on, sweetheart, get yourself together. I've never seen so many animals dying. Nothing but shit and blood, shit and blood. Shit and blood. You feeling good? You should wear warm clothes. You need to wear sweaters. One on top of the other. Several layers. I've also worked in there. Okay? We do have one double room with a small fridge and kitchen area. Do you want to make a booking for that? Do you want to make a booking for that? Do you want to make a booking for that? Your wife isn't going to make it. Can't you put her on packaging, or on fritters? Do you think any of us is on fritters or on packaging? They have the English for that. The smell of shit and blood makes her sick. The whole factory stinks of shit and blood. The whole town stinks of shit and blood. Not all of it. I liked watching you dance. I see you're a good worker but your wife is totally useless. Think about what you want to do. It isn't easy here. I'll do what I have to do. Go and sit, we'll talk again later. You can trust me, Tânia. Go on. Move! Go get your fucking money. What's going on? You fucking owe the money. - What's going on? - Don't go in there, Tat. Do you want me to fucking pull your fucking head off? Please, can you go help him? Please, just help him. I'm here to do one fucking job. He's paying me to fucking do you. Soon as he says 'do it' I'll cut your fucking head off. - Get the money, go! Go get it! - Get his fucking money paid! Now! - I was gonna pay you tonight. - You got it, we know you got it. It doesn't work that way, you owe money to this man. I don't care how you get it, Richard. Just fucking get it.

They said that there's no way I can let you in, I'm afraid. I'm your friend, but I'm not allowed to let you in. Why didn't you tell me she was your brother's wife? I've talked to the line leader and the team leader and the manager. It's all sorted out. You'll have a job after the Christmas campaign. If you want to stay here. What about Sandra?

My savings... - My savings... - Get lost! - Fuck off. - Give me my money back! Give me my savings back. Clear off! - Give me my savings back. - Get lost, shut up, people are sleeping! My savings! Give me back my savings! Carlos! Give me back my savings! Give me back my savings! My love... My love... There's the mother to the Portuguese. Yeah, my arse. Get lost, fuck off! Clear out! You fucking cow. Fucking retard. I have been studying the traits and dispositions of the lower animals, and contrasting them with the traits and dispositions of men. I find the result humiliating to me. For it obliges me to renounce my allegiance to Darwin's theory of the ascent of man from the lower animals. I now believe this theory should be vacated in favour of a new and truer one. This new and truer one, to be called: the descent of man from the higher animals. When I'm tortured, the lullaby my mother used to sing to me comes back into my mind: One for sorrow. Two for joy. Three for a girl. And four for a boy. Five for silver. And six for gold. Seven is a secret Never to be told. Eight a wish. Nine a kiss. Ten is a bird You must not wish. Based on the accounts of Great Yarmouth residents.
