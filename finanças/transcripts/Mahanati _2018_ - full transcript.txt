I'll act in that too I'll do whatever film he asks me to But this role of Parvati Devdas Parvati When I was reading it... ...I felt I was living that role! Only you can convince my father Vani madam I've been wanting to tell you Did you know 'Devdas' was started with Sowcar Janaki and then stopped? Is that so? Okay, I was- Savitri was only 18 years then Very young What I was trying to tell you is- Are you Vani? Please wait We are talking, right? May I know who you are? My name is G.V.G Krishnan My friend Keshava told me about you Do you know Shankaraiya? Don't know who Shankaraiya is But I always wanted to write a story on Savitri madam But you are...? - Have you watched 'Devdas'? - No Anthony sir I acted as the eldest son of the zamindar Bujanga Rao? If I get time off from shooting or at home I'll go whenever I can to meet her Not only about her films Her wish list and her woes Stories, news So many experiences I never got around to compiling it as a book I haven't been able to archive all the facts But the world should know her story Keshav told me he felt you were very upfront and honest Please write Savitri amma's story 'Not biscuits, no incense sticks, nothing' 'What is it then?' An empty box! To ridicule me Do I need all this to make fun of you, Paru? This was just to tease you and make you smile I chose you because you have 'the girl next door' image, Savitri Show a little bit of innocence Sure, director sir Note this point Don't see Nageswara Rao in Devdas But look for Devdas in Nageswara Rao, okay? As you wish, hero sir Likewise don't see Savitri in Parvati Look for Parvati in Savitri Do a good job Even now nothing is lost Let's replace her with a senior artiste Is it an ordinary character? Parvati! There's some spark in that girl, Manickam Let's see Empty box This was a prank to tease me That Tamil film's producer is kicking me like a football, come 1 more shot, father I'll come after that Enough Why so many shots for an alcoholic? Let's go Father...! That...that is- [mispronounces dialog] Cut...cut...cut Haven't you learnt Tamil as yet? Tamil must have been unfamiliar to you Now that you are here you'll rattle it fluently I have written this dialog in Tamil Sacred thread around the neck... ...however heavy it may be A mature mind and loving heart to bear the ups and downs till the end ...is the key to happiness In Telugu it means, the wedding chain you wear throughout your life However heavy, bear it with love through thick and thin is the meaning Listen The extent to which you express this soulfully ...you can be the prima donna and make waves in our Tamil industry We can make waves Wave your magic wand! Savitri, look here Didn't I predict your name will echo everywhere? Is it being heard? How is it you are here? Is it enough if a film has a heroine alone? What about the hero? Is that right? I never thought GG was you? I wanted to meet you when I am in Madras Why...? Because of you- I mean the photos you clicked ...I got this opportunity Thank you very much Nonsense! Your talent brought you here How is your first day in cinema? Cinema is peculiar and language is unfamiliar! I'm meandering in a strange field! What is that? You need to know the language to read a book To learn the language you don't need books Then how will you learn? You answer that too If you live life, you'll get it Live life means? After the shoot today come with me, I'll show you Good lord! What will I tell my nana? Say something in the language you know Not possible Return my book please Haven't you memorised the dialogs as yet, dear? Sometime back, a man was looking at you intently Maybe he will also want you to act in a film Let's accept that film too But we must be clear about the payment Father, Girija asked me to check the costumes I'll come back home by myself Black monkey! You said 'live life to learn a language' Why bring me here? Life begins and ends only in a hospital How are you? Doing fine? Learn Tamil from her I'll be right back Me...? How will I understand? I have sugar from head to toe I can't taste a single 'laddu' or 'jilebi' Sweetmeats? It's a real torture! A long list of do's and don'ts to eat This side What did she say? When I didn't understand, how can I pretend I knew? You are listening to her words You need language for words But not for the heart Learn to speak from your heart What happened? I'm unable to bear the pain in my hand Hand, huh? 'Kai' in Tamil means hand - All because of my 'thalai vidhi' - That means? It's all because of my fate Fate, huh? 'Thalai vidhi' means fate 'Kai' means hand Very sorry Four 2 ones and one 4 4...4 - Gone case - That means? Potti Sriramulu, long live! 'Unna viradham' means? Hunger strike What is amusing you? They are protesting in Tami wanting a separate Telugu state! What is in a language? It is enough if they understand the emotion behind their slogan 'The sacred thread around the neck...' '...however heavy it may be' '...to bear that till the end' '...a mature mind, devotion, love, affinity, affection, honesty' 'All these virtues are very important' 'Am I not destined to have even this, father?' 'Please tell me, father' Tell me Sir, shall I ask them to 'cut'? Go ahead The way you speak Tamil... ...even the Tamil women will be stunned Why do you need a dubbing artiste? Very good...very good "My forever friend who walks with me" "In my life's journey Filled with flowers of harmony" "Every bend and intersection" "Inviting me with utmost affection" "This was my heartfelt wish everyday" "This was my dearest dream everyday" "I realised it only today" "Time waltzed with you anew Made your dream come true" "Won't life bloom just for you?" "Time waltzed with you true blue Found your one and only beau" Aiyo! God save me! What happened? How much longer? It has to come from within, right? That's the feel I want No...no 1 minute Before he gets the right feel I'll be dead and gone Let's live then, come "Time waltzed with you true blue Found your one and only beau" "Won't life blossom just for you?" "Time waltzed with you anew Made your dream come true" - I want to ride piggyback on you - Come, dear What's the use of playing all these games? I haven't played even a single game with my father you know Hasn't Mr Chowdhury played with you when you were a kid? He's my uncle He was more of a guardian to me But he never stepped into the shoes of a real father Whomever I saw, I wondered if my father would have been like him I missed out on games and piggyback rides I can't get back my childhood, can I? Savitri, get up Get up - Why? - Stand, I'll tell you Give me your hand "Like deluge to the river mind spirited with fervor" "When shyness left its shell" "When energy accelerated as well" "Love-thoughts as drizzle in sight Body as a rainbow arched in delight" "When did her youth's halo with happiness overflow?" "When did her style sparkle aglow?" "Before realization dawned" "Tunes in harmony hummed" "In some veena this love-melody was strummed" "Time waltzed with you anew Made your dream come true" "Won't life bloom just for you?" "Time waltzed with you true blue Found your one and only beau" Wouldn't it have been great if Devdas had married Parvati? Their love would be a fairy tale ending You won't be a heroine! Will he forget their love just because Parvati got married? Is his love so weak? May be his strength was to let go of her? That means? Even after Devdas was married... ...are you saying Parvati would have agreed to be his 2nd wife? Yes, definitely Wasn't she in love with him? If that Devdas was Gemini Ganesan? I am married, Savitri I have 2 daughters too I wanted to become a doctor I did not have money to pay for my education Just to make my dream of becoming a doctor come true ...I married my uncle's daughter Alamelu But my uncle passed away Hands of fate turned Ramaswamy Ganesan who wanted to be a doctor ...into this hero Gemini Ganesan After I got married, it is true I had a fling with Pushpavalli But none of those was true love The cherished moments I spend with you now This is true love If a married man falls in love... ...it may be a litmus test to his marriage vows or his love But only this is genuine, Savitri My past is true My love is real "Is everything a mere illusion?" "Is this a light in my life of delusion?" Manickam Shall we choose some other heroine? I won't let go of you [song from 'Devdas'] Stop it What is this, Savitri? If you don't talk to me- If someone sees us, what will they think? Let go of my hand "Have you forgotten your childhood friend who played pranks with you no end" "Don't you remember your childhood friend who played with you hours on end?" Till you promise not to drink I won't leave this place By forcing a promise out of me ...do you want to rob me of what little peace of mind I have, Paru? Cut Manickam, in the next scene- Cut...cut Someone stop her Savitri, what is this? It was just a role in a film and will you break your head into two? Will anyone bang her head like this? Was Nageswara Rao really a drunkard? It's just acting Stop glowering at me If you behave like a lunatic once more... ...I'll break your teeth! Break her teeth, sir Isn't it wrong? She has gone to great lengths to ensure the shot is realistic Acting? Is it so tough to live Parvati's role? Is it such a big deal to merge into the character? Isn't it notable if even after 100 years... ...this Parvati is remembered for the film 'Devdas'? Mere acting Your daughter need not be a famous actress Let her be an ordinary heroine Isn't that so, Chowdhury sir? Sir, did he compliment me or condemn me now? Act...it's all an act Everyone acts That dialog should be in the interval block only It's such a wonderful dialog If you emote well you'll become a great actress You go, I'll follow you This side, pull it That's right Gemini sir! I'm fine, it's alright Union of mind, words and action are the 3 knots tied in a wedding Only if 2 hearts merge it is ordained to be a bond If that's missing you can tie many knots It will be an affidavit, that's all That vow is for a lifetime Can that promise be broken? That means I shouldn't even think of another woman But you invaded my mind When you have a wife waiting for you why would you think of me? You are the only one in my heart, my dearest I didn't get married because I wanted to Even if I tried to stop falling in love I failed miserably If I was assured in our next birth we will be married... I'll happily die now- I don't fear death, my dear If we do not have another birth... ...will the Gemini-Savitri love story also be ...immortal like the tale of Devdas-Parvati? If we have just 1 birth... ...will we be compelled to continue like this? Half our lives we are in a reel world in front of the camera Shouldn't we be true to our remaining real life? We can act in life But our life shouldn't be just an act But how? You are already married Marriage...wedding vows! This is a man made ritual when he lived in the jungle If we trust our hearts why do we need this ritual? Do you love me? Can you live without me? Look, Savitri I have immense faith in this love But not in getting married Everyone won't be blessed with a love like ours Nissankara Savitri I, Ramasamy Ganesan ...with Goddess Chamundeswari as witness ...I take you as my wedded wife in thought, word and deed Their wedding was a simple affair just like in a film, right? Not just one, I can cite another example What? I didn't know they had got married before the release of 'Devdas' Both 'Devdas' and 'Manam Pol Mangalyam' were released after they got married And were box office hits at the same time After that? For 3-4 years Some hits and some flops At that time Anjali madam and Bhanumathi madam were very popular Savitri madam was up-and-coming Original heroine of 'Missamma' was Bhanumathi madam One day director Chakrapani burnt all the reels... ...following an argument with Bhanumathi madam Savitri madam who was the co-star stepped into the heroine's shoes Didn't Gemini sir play NTR's role in the Tamil version? In reel life she had to act as if she was married though she was single In real life she had to act as if she was single even though she was married This is a really unique story "Warm welcome to the silver moon" "Come and listen to our story soon" "A big hello to the moon shining high" "Listen to our story without a sigh" "Welcome, silver moon in the purple sky" "With vows taken informally in my life I got the status as your wife" "Without vows taken with family around I became your wife unannounced" Our 1st 'Festival of lights' after marriage "Words well used as lies Acting fine-tuned as a device" Greetings Why are you so late? We have been waiting for you Why don't you burst crackers, sir? Me...burst crackers? Yes, go ahead I am not too fond of this Too much of pollution Bad for health Where...hello? - Isn't anyone - Come here ...at home? "Her religion means the world to her My religion she will ignore" "She will never think of us as 'we' while standing in front of me" "Warm welcome to the silver moon" "Come and listen to our story soon" [song from 'Missamma'] "Only when he picks a love-fight his world brims with delight" "Rewrite your destiny in life's journey Strengthen your bond of holy matrimony" Sekhar, keep this box in the car Okay, madam You mean to say Gemini's first wife was unaware of their relationship? Whether she knew or not... ...Savitri madam was petrified of her Don't cry Wipe your tears Poor thing! Her daughter is the reason for her distress She can't accept this even on her funeral pyre, let her cry it out Your Tamil love letter Translate it in Telugu 'My dearest, I cannot be without seeing you' 'Shall we both go to the beach to spend sometime alone?' 'Come as soon as you hear me honk twice' 'Yours lovingly your Ganesh' I...nana You don't have the right to call me 'father' Isn't this wrong, my dear? No...! I don't know how to explain this to all of you Please forgive me Hey! How dare you get married! You wretched female! Stop it Will you kill her? She didn't realize the repercussions I walked into it with my eyes open I agreed to marry him knowing he is married and has children Because I love him How dare you! Shameless hussy! Your daughter has crossed all lines of decency She won't prosper hereafter I put her on such a high pedestal She let me down so badly I should bang my head in disgust He'll come now, right? Let him announce his secret signal! I bought it only the day before But little did I think it would come in handy so soon Nana...don't! I know how to teach you a lesson Please don't! Go...stay locked in there Father...! Nana I'll open this door only after I kill him As if she can get away with this namesake marriage If any of you tries to open the door... ...I'll shoot you first Move aside Hey! Who is she, ma? Revathi, go to bed Tea What's the use of crying now? Drink tea and wash your face Please stop crying, dear What has happened now? All along I was wondering how to break the news I don't have to worry about it now He'll kill you He will never accept you If a scoundrel deceives his darling daughter... ...won't a father be angry? Anyone in his shoes will react like that Can't blame him Then what do we do now? What is this I heard? I believe you fell in love with him? Forget him He isn't right for you I got married to him You know how many come to Madras to become a star? You've become one Try to understand its value If this news gets around no one will make a film with you This will end your career, Savitri I'm already married to him Your wish What do you mean 'your wish'? If you wanted to marry, why didn't you tell me? I would have found a prince for you Where did you pick him up? My slippers will speak! Who are you to talk in my house? Chowdhury Wait Instead of chastising him for marrying her when he's already married... ...are you supporting him? If they aren't married... ...but living together secretly, is everything ironed out? Chowdhury This has gone past the stage of acceptance Bless them wholeheartedly When his first wife has agreed, what's your problem? Asking me why I should worry? Do you know how much I struggled to make her a heroine? I gave up all my comforts to make her comfortable I spent all my savings on her I don't want anything I earned House Lands in our home town Every asset I've earned so far You can help yourself to everything To the very last paisa But allow us to lead our own lives I treated your dream as mine You've tumbled our world upside down Call yourself reporters? You should be ashamed! Other papers crack jokes and paint me to be a fool! Look at this, they claim I am Shankaraiya We met everyone Actors, directors, producers But didn't find anyone by that name Hasn't she written that name? Then a Shankaraiya is somewhere out there There's a story behind that name I need to know that story Whoever brings that story will occupy the subeditor's seat Take-home salary Rs 1000 Rani, I will ensure your article makes it to the front page At least now go, I say Front page! But Sekar couldn't trace him even after hunting high &amp; low and neither could we Wonder where he is! Let's see ...how this story unfolds Savitri madam, is it true you got married 3 years ago? Sir, will you divorce your 1st wife? Madam Savitri, heard you quit films? That's it, no more questions Please leave all of you Kumbakonam 'sambar' This is even more delicious than your 'pappu charu' Check if salt is enough If you continue to sulk like this are you accepting we were wrong? Mother, uncle, director sir I've upset everyone Have I gone mad? Yes, whoever knows about our love must have thought we are stark raving mad! Let them think Salt is perfect But we should also think about the world, right? World...! Now that Savitri and Gemini Ganesan are married ...will the world stop rotating! Nonsense...! We planned to seize every moment? Shouldn't we? Let's go out this evening Out...? - No need - Why...? Before marriage we painted the town red Does it make sense if we hide indoors now? We got married not to end up as a problem to ourselves? If being married is our problem what is this, Savitri? That's so true Let's go I loved this film That girl has done a brilliant job, right? If she watches your film, she'll think the same too! Hello, where to?

What is wrong with this girl? Ask for His forgiveness Lord Vishnu, have mercy on her Grandma, after Savitri madam got married ...did people think her career was over? Yes, they did But that's when the actual story started "If we work, singing and dancing together boredom won't bother us ever" [song from 'Thodi Kodallu'] Sir, please come in Please sit down How is married life treating you?

Go...play Will anyone drink in a club in front of both his daughters? Then...? Asking me to drink in front of both my wives? Repeat Do you how much Alamelu akka is worried about you? She cries so often It's a known fact women love to turn on the waterworks! But only a bottle knows how a man drowns his sorrows! Are you drinking because of me? Because of me Even when I am falling down, won't you give me credit? I take all the blame! My love, my marriage, my bottle and my glass Just because 2 of your films flopped... ...have you forgotten your celebrity status? Do you know about your huge fan following? Repeat Are you Savitri madam? Yes I watched your 'Narthanasala film' Can I have your autograph please? Excuse me Do you have a pen? Thank you Please Thank you, Savitri Sorry, you lost your pen It's alright I'll stop acting That's wrong Not right, dear Don't ever say that Do you remember... ...when you 1st came to Gemini studio? You said I'll make my mark in cinema I remember I love you a lot, dear But not interested in the institution of marriage How ironic! A man who is not interested in marriage ...has married twice! Enough...! If you drink you'll only get such crazy thoughts, let's go 'All India Radio Hyderabad' 'Cine actress Savitri and her husband Gemini Ganesan...' '...went to Ravindra Bharathi to be specially honored today' Namaste, madam We welcome you on behalf of Andhra Kala Parishad We welcome you on behalf of our Telugu community What is the next program? To participate in an elephant procession Our association has decided to honor you with pomp and splendor - What is her name? - Gajalakshmi, madam Why choose an elephant?

That's wrong Along with this legend of an actress... ...an ordinary actor like me was honored? No...no...no Committee members want to apologize to you I told them to come Oh! Fantastic! They got your approval, right? Very good Very good I reprimanded them That's why they want to apologize Otherwise they wouldn't have, huh? Hey, why are you upset now, dear? I should be the one crying They honored you in such a dignified manner And disgraced me If you want to celebrate... ...this is the event Why are you like this? It is said, 'Sorrow shared is heartache halved' Come, share a drink with me You're a great actress, right? I am not your equal to share a drink with you! Slowly What's the problem with you men? It's okay if your wife succeeds a bit But very successful that's it! Who are you to restrain our success? Me...? Vani garu You know she was to be conferred the Padma Shri award? She turned it down because she didn't know how Gemini would react Then what happened? She declined offers that came her way gradually For the 1st time... ...in 1966 an article was published claiming she had become fat Even though Savitri madam is fat... ...your expressive face gave you the box office hits, he says Hey Sathyam Have I put on weight again? Whether you are fat or not you will be people's favorite If one's body goes through changes... ...it means a change for the good will happen in life too Let's see what is in store for me What does it mean? Whatever! I think good times are ahead Taste this 'laddu' Isn't this 1969?

You never told me the reason for your visit For the 1st time in the world... ...only with lady technicians ...we are planning a film We want you to direct that film And you'll be the captain of the ship Direction...? What do I know? If you agree to direct, we'll go ahead Otherwise we'll just ditch it [Holy chant] Start camera Action If you pressurize me I can't do anything Give me some time How can I lend without surety? Listen, Savitri madam They had promised to finance our film We are all women, right? Now they claim unless a new person signs a surety... ...they won't fund us Go to women financiers Maybe they will lend without surety! Who will sign at the drop of a hat? We'll be forced to shelve the film now I'll sign No problem Is this the surety paper? Shailaja First take a wide angle Then a close up shot We can shoot the song there You can't see her now We want to meet Savitri madam Move aside Everything will be clear when you borrow money Everything will seem like chaos now Madam, don't you recognise us? We came with the producer You signed the guarantee We trusted you and lent money without any collateral You haven't repaid even one paisa back! How much do I owe you? With interest you owe us 0.37 million We thought you will ensure we are paid But you have paid from your pocket That's okay It's my film, right? - Watch the film with your family - Sure, thank you Namaste Please go inside Rani, make sure everything is arranged - Welcome - Namaste Madam, hasn't the 'King of Love' come?

Why...why...how could you? Listen to me just once No need Savitri, please! Don't hit her Savitri...! Savitri Stop Listen to me, dear Tell me...what will you tell me? Everyone is looking at us Aren't we film stars? Let them watch It was a mistake That's my weakness But it isn't love! Aren't you ashamed? It's my bloody karma! I didn't listen to anyone Please forgive me, dear Only you mean the world to me I haven't loved any other woman in my life the way I love you You don't talk about love A love unsatiated by one wedding To think you'll be satisfied with 2 wives was my stupidity You married me well aware of my past, right? Alamelu, Pushpavalli What has happened now? I was Savitri then Now I am Savitri Ganesan! Madam, your film is a huge hit Get out Wait, madam I don't want to come Want to sleep next to your mother?

What do you mean? Isn't he your husband? I've never set eyes on the man in this photo Some mix up somewhere! Whatever my mother did was so different from what anyone else did Same when she drank too She could never accept being a failure But she wanted to succeed along with my father Today's bills, madam Sathyam is handling all that 'She put on so much weight, offers dropped drastically' 'Even her intention to remake 'Mooga Manasulu' was...' '...to be honest, spurred by her anger against my father' You have a visitor, madam I don't want to meet anyone now Won't you at least turn and look? What is the point? You promised not to produce this film Do you remember? You promised me too Do you remember? Your managers are all crooks Entire industry is talking of how they are looting you Actor, producer and director How can you don so many caps? If you need any help- I don't need any help from anyone I don't need anyone in my life You are too stubborn for your own good, Savitri You bottle up all your feelings Only if you share your woes you can have peace of mind Come, let's share a drink Listen, my dear- Stop right there Leave me alone, go 'Unable to snuff her love for my father' '...she turned it into a way of punishing herself' 'During her film's release 2 of Sivaji Ganesan's films flopped' 'So no one came forward to buy this film' Someone I know has the rights of the Tamil film 'Vietnam Veedu' If you remake it in Telugu it will be a super hit, madam If we release both the films together ...one will be a sure shot hit, madam Alright, let's do it Sign here, madam How much? I'll enquire and fill in the amount Who the hell are you? Stop right there We are from the Income tax department We had sent you a notice but there was no response I don't know the details about all this I'll call my manager now- Madam, no phone calls We have a warrant with us Search here You go to that room 'My daughter doesn't know about any of this, sir' Her husband is the one who takes care of everything Then ask him to come Ma, they are taking away all our jewelry You've sealed it, right? Be careful with all the stuff 50% interest will be added to your outstanding tax Till all your papers are checked- Where should I sign? Sign here If you seize all my assets ...how will I manage to pay up? Don't you have 3 months grace time? My family members are your fans Can you sign an autograph for my daughter please? Thank you, madam Bye Vani garu I got 2 tickets for 'Maro Charitra' Will you come with me? Anthony garu, we have work to do Vani garu, this is also part of our assignment 'If you can enquire about it-' Okay, I will 'I'll attend to it But if you know more details-' Nana! Though you are a girl I agreed to let you work I need my head to be examined! What is the con...connection between the two? Don't talk back When you kept harping it was a good story... ...little did I think it would end up as your love story! Enough is enough! I am finalizing the Madurai alliance Get married and get lost! Move aside What happened, dear? Sir, we are handing our daughter to you as your daughter-in-law With the grace of Lord Shiva Vani Anthony sir asked me to... ...give this invitation to you His engagement it seems 1 minute Tell me, will you keep removing your glasses? This is reality Truth is always beautiful Both the films have flopped? Where is Sathyam? I haven't seen him - Be more assertive? - Let's see if she doesn't I have to get my money back somehow You come up with the same excuses When will you pay up? Both my films flopped I don't have the money to pay you back now If you give me 2 days grace time- If you run away somewhere? You have stashed up money and pretending you are broke I am not that great an actress! I can't act for nuts unless I am in front of the camera I'll repay you with the interest Shailaja, remember I had bought 100 acres of land in your name? I am in urgent need of money now 'We sold that land for our daughter's marriage' 'I can't pay you now' Purushotham anna, I had bought a house in your name in Bezawada 'We are staying in that house' 'We would be 'care of roadside' if we are forced to sell it' "How many ever obstacles hinder you forever with ease you will turn them in your favor" "You can swim against the tide resolutely And reach the shores of safety absolutely" Sell Vijaya Mills for a good price Whatever the rate I don't mind Didn't you save that for your daughter's wedding? Your money in the school Trust in Chirravuru, 2 million No, I can't break the faith the Trust has in me So let us not touch that amount - You just sell the mill - Okay, madam Ma, are you feeling upset we've lost all our money? I was forced to see you ruin your life all these years But if you spoil your children's lives and their future, I can't keep quiet If you continue like this I may have to send your children to your husband Shut up! After all that has happened I don't need your advice What I was trying to say is- Madam, come soon "Life is meaningless to me" "Emptiness envelops me totally" "Nothing but vacuum, isn't it?" "This hollowness am I forced to live with" Mother Ma, what are you doing here? There's no electricity The servants are nowhere to be found Yes, true No one is there for me Enough of drinking Let's have dinner Viji, give me the glass How much will you drink? After grandma passed away, have you given us a thought? You'll drink yourself to death Viji, I want my glass back Slap me, go on, kill me Viji, what are you doing? Stop it Ma...! "If someone asks who you are" "You are the kaleidoscopic star who spins magic very far" Amma...? "Who animates evergreen silhouettes on the silver screen?" "You are the reel life real queen" AMMA...! "The world celebrates your glory" "In every role, every story you create footprints in history" Amma Forgive me, ma You are the child but you behaved more like the mother than I did No, ma, I am to blame I won't behave like this ever again What is that? You are diabetic I'm injecting insulin Am I diabetic? Being addicted to drinking along with it can prove fatal You have to be careful First you have to lose weight Sit down, fath...uncle Whoever asks you, call me 'nana' Otherwise these town people will act too big for their boots If I knew you will visit me only when I am in a hospital... ...I would have got myself admitted much earlier, nana Pull yourself together, dear I'll go and settle the bill We must get Vijaya married, nana I found out today I am diabetic I don't know what tomorrow holds for me I have to change my ways, nana I must take better care of my children Vani You have a visitor What brings you here? I received the letter you wrote a month ago Have you finished your story? I feel like reading it I quit work What is the point in writing this story? Why was such a won...wonderful woman punished like this for no fault of hers? Forget God What about the people around her? Not 1 person came forward to help her Where did you go? From her childhood, Savitri was never in the habit of accepting help from anyone The Income tax department seized her assets She sold her house and repaid all her loans with interest She started accepting even small roles in films She struggled single handed to control her diabetes and alcoholism The doctors were astounded by her will power and weight loss "I watered 'henna' in my garden daily" "This ground paste of green 'mehendi' Bloomed on little palms as red buds gaily" "I watered 'henna' in my garden daily" "This ground paste of green 'mehendi' Bloomed on little palms as red buds gaily" [song from 'Gorintaku'] Brother, shall we go? Madam...you? Take me to Vijaya studios You should travel by a car in royal style Instead coming in this rickshaw- So what? I get a lot of fresh air No need to spend on petrol Will I get this pleasure if I travel by car? Your addiction to alcohol I have quit drinking 'But' 'You know it is even more stubborn than me?' 'Most people call it a bad habit' 'But it is a disease' Just like cancer... ...alcoholism has to be treated I've read about this it is quite common abroad They are called de-addiction centers I would like to start one such center by this riverside It's my dearest wish Let's go Had lunch, my dear? Not hungry, sir Don't you even have the courtesy to find out if she had lunch? I am so- Aiyo! It's okay I know...I know Serve lunch for us Come, dear How many people you would have showered your hospitality on? We are in the 'Kali' yuga Nowadays people rob the ring from the hand that feeds It's alright, forget it I am happy if they benefitted from my simple hospitality Habibullah road, right? No, I live in Anna Nagar now Is that so, madam? My daughter is a hardcore fan of yours She has big eyes, just like you Is that so? What is she doing? I educated her till 5th form I got an alliance for her day before yesterday That's good news But I don't know if I will have the funds to perform the wedding Let's see what happens I'll take leave, madam 1 minute I'll be back - Danaiyah - Madam - Tell me, madam - Will you run an errand for me? Take this sari to the pawn shop behind our house Exchange this for some cash What is this, madam? Please go, hurry up - Sir - Madam - Please accept - What is this? Even people I know won't help But your generosity- How will I ever repay your kindness? Perform your daughter's wedding in style That is more than enough Thank you, madam You have to write this story, dear Her story is swamped in sorrow It is true But she had the strength to wipe her tears and rise 'You will now listen to commercials from Vijayawada and Hyderabad' 'In our next program tune in to legendary actress Savitri's soulful talk' 'I cut all my ties for the man I loved' 'As a tribute to true love I renounced the love of my life' 'In this short unpredictable life we lead true love for even a second is a blessing' 'I cherished that love for 20 long years' 'Not everyone is blessed by this kind of love' 'If you are that lucky fight against all odds' 'You live only once' Come, dear Look at this Your father-in-law to be has brought the invitation I am marrying Anthony, father Shut up!

You landed here all of a sudden? How can we discuss this later? Anthony, listen Life is very short In that short span we should live life to the fullest Whatever has to happen will happen, good or bad Listen to me You are very beautiful You can easily find a handsome groom Vani garu, you- Allow me to finish I tend to stammer To get rid of it, I was told I should become more self confident I spoke for so long now Did I stammer?

She's my sister Divya She is Madhuravani B.A, gold medallist He is Ajay Divya's fianc? Congratulations! Vani- Can I ask you something? Sure, Anthony garu You rushed here without your glasses?

I am Savitri speaking Tell me, sir 'By the 24th of this month' '...you must pay a penalty of Rs 0.2 million' 'We even sent your notice through registered post' Why should I pay some more? You have grabbed whatever I earned You sealed all my assets I've even sold my house Won't you let me live in peace? 'If you don't pay up, we'll be forced to take you to court' Why should I pay? You won't get even 1 rupee Take whatever action you want If I say I won't it means 'no' Ma...? You wanted to come with me, right? Get ready Pack your bag Okay, ma How are you, Shoba? Satish keeps thinking of you He wants to get a stuffed toy Satish, do you remember me? - Remember her? - Come here, dear What toy do you want? - Toy dog - Is that so? If you don't mind... ...will you take him shopping 0.2 million it seems, lawyer sir I have saved it for the past 2 years to build a rehabilitation center How can I keep paying penalty throughout my life, sir? 'This is regarding your income tax' 'It isn't something we can find fault with' 'If we don't comply we'll be in deep trouble' 'It will be contempt of court' Then why do I pay you a retainer? I don't care if I am arrested I won't part with the money I've saved for my dream "Soured relationship between husband &amp; wife embedded strife in a smooth life" [song from 'Missiamma'] "Warm welcome to the silver moon" "Come and listen to our story soon" 'Hello, Gemini Ganesan speaking' 'Hello...who is this?' 'Can you hear me?' 'My dear?' You, huh? 'Can't you see me walking down the stairs?' 'Are you blind?' - Forgive me, madam - You ruined my sari I'll report you to the manager It was a mistake, madam I am so sorry "A war without victory in place" "Makes time tick at its own pace" "How to restore this strife Wipe the upheavals in my life?" "A scar to savor sweet I feel" "The heart will never heal this sweet scar I conceal" "How much longer can my soul tolerate a jolt out of control?" 'Listen, how much will you charge to take us to Barani studio?' '10 paise, sir' 'It's alright, uncle Let's take a tram' "Places we visited Happy times unlimited" "Mere dreams, no more Wearily washed ashore" "If all those are my mind's hallucination my heart aflame, suffused in suffocation" "Memories still crystal clear chased by moments held dear" "Distraught, she sought consolation in numbness by intoxication" 'Clear out now Your daughter won't suit this role' 'Don't you know Tamil?' 'It's okay...to get it right in the photo' 'Would Parvati have agreed to be his 2nd wife?' 'Yes, definitely' 'Wasn't she in love with him?' 'If that Devadas was Gemini Ganesan?' "Does the ceaseless sea at least accept the turbulence buried in-depth?" "Did the compelling need in-built to touch the sky get fulfilled?" "In the ensuing clash of wills of good over evil" "Will it be finally known which is ambrosia, which is poison?" 'Are you drinking because of me?' 'Because of me' 'Even when I am falling down, won't you give me credit?' 'I take all the blame!' "Tongues of flames scorch my heart" "I fumble, I (s)tumble, I fall apart" "Night and day merged as one for this jewel in the crown" You've ruined everything, dear "In the inferno of hell's prison" "Love has turned into poison" "In the end what is left for me?" "If I have to drink this only who can change my destiny" "Your dreams came true in your own (a)venue" 'How do I start the story which already has a tragic ending?' 'I pursued her story' 'But I found history instead' 'I couldn't trace Shankaraiya' 'Even if I found him now I have no questions to ask' 'I thought writing about Savitri amma was restricted only to cinema' 'But 'Behind the scenes' of cinema I stumbled on her magnanimity' 'She spooned a slice of herself in every role she enacted in reel life' 'Only a bit of her life is still sticking on to her now' 'I feel like turning back the clock and saving her from the jaws of death' 'She is like the golden moon shining in the starlit sky' 'Once upon a time there lived a great actress' Madhuravani! - Sister...akka - What is it? "Thanks to your endearing face Telugu got the befitting pride of place" Madhuravani madam? Yes I should have returned this long ago I was wrong "Leading lady, o' diva" Please ensure she knows I have returned it "You are our prima donna" "A woman of substance An actress par excellence" Savitri madam, aren't you fond of jasmine? I offered it to Goddess Shakthi and brought it for you Forgive me for turning my back on you and speaking Your million fans and me Whenever we think of you we want to remember you as Parvati in 'Devdas' Sasirekha of 'Mayabazar' Miss Mary of 'Missamma' fame A few months ago... ...I didn't know anything about you I started on a journey of getting to know you In that process I discovered myself I believe you wanted to set up a rehabilitation center Do you remember Jyothi? You lent your diamond necklace for her wedding Not being able to return it when you needed it most ...she repents for it every single day Jyothi and Susheela have monetised your necklace And started a rehab clinic to make your dream come true Life is too short It can change with twists and turns anytime is what I learnt from your life I should live life on my own terms Your life taught me this What remains in the end? The love we shared The trips we take down memory lane For having enriched me On behalf of my generation And on behalf of posterity Thank you from the bottom of my heart People all over the world are upset you may pass away soon Can death take you away? How is it possible? Generations to come will watch your films They will shower their affection on you Laugh with you Cry with you You are immortal "An actress extraordinaire" I have brought you a gift I heard you were searching for this photo I found it in our newspaper archives Before you were born This is your father's photo With his name written on it I have nothing else to give you "Connoisseur of arts" "Conqueror of hearts" "An actress extraordinaire" "A jewel in the crown rare" He looks shorter in reality than in the cinemas, eh? But he is so handsome Look at that heroine next to him She is such a bad match Do you think we can meet Nageswara Rao again? When I become a heroine you can see him daily in the shoot Good lord! My uncle would have come back home I'm going, see you, Susi When will I see you again? Tomorrow In a cinema again I feel like talking to you nonstop Hoping to see all of you once again for sure I take leave Jai Hind!
