- Yes? - Doctor, do you remember me? I was your patient, Carla Patrici... I need you. Come back tomorrow morning. I have no place to go. - You were here last night, right? - Yes. The doctor said you can wait her here. She'll be back at noon. You can take a warm shower and rest. - Are you on an empty stomach? - Yes. Ok, please pee in this pot. I'll take it back later. - Do you want some tea? - No, thanks. - I'll bring you a cup of tea. - Ok. Good evening. Hello. How long? I don't know, maybe a month. Please, I'm asking if you are 4 or 5 months pregnant. Breathe. And the father? I was raped. Three men. Cough. Again. Carla Patrici. Five years ago you came for the same reason. Last time you were with your husband. Yes, Edmundo. He passed away 3 years ago. I didn't see you again. Everything went well? Where and with whom do you live now? I was living alone, in a lodge. Everything I have is in my bag. This is not the best time of my life. And how were you planning to pay? - Do you have an ID? - Yes. Take a seat. Abortion is no longer possible. But I have a lot of patients that cannot have children, and they would be willing to adopt yours. This would solve your problem in the least violent way, and you could get a lot of money. But, since my patients pay very well... In case the donor changes her mind, I have to offer them an insurance that they will be compensated for waiting and expectations. That's why I usually ask for either mortgage or collateral guarantees. What can you offer me as insurance? Nothing. Me. Only myself. Let's do all the medical exams first, so we can talk with more certainty. You can stay here, while we wait for your results. Thank you very much, doctor. Dominga, come please. We lock up everything up at 10 p.m. and turn on the alarm. Dominga is here from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. I work downtown every day from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., except for Thursdays when I work here, in my operating room. Dinner is served at 8 p.m. You can't leave the house. If you leave, you can't come back. Do you understand? Your results will be ready next Tuesday, then we can talk again and organize. May I speak to Perla, please? Hi Perla, how do you do? Great. I may have something new, to be confirmed on Thursday or Friday. Friday at 7 p.m. Perfect. Unless I call you again, we're set. Kisses, and send my love to Roberto. Yes? Is everything fine? Yes. What is she doing? She's reading magazines. Draw a sample of her blood tomorrow morning, before I leave. I'll take everything with me along with the urine sample. Take her pressure and temperature now, and open a daily file for her. I'm leaving an envelope for Ortiz. Tell him I need everything before Friday. Rape changes a life's axis. From that moment on, everything revolves around that, orbiting that invasive and destructive phallus. Maybe that's what rapists want: the assurance that somewhere, someone will never forget them, the feeling of becoming the incarnation of fate. - Do you want some cake? - Yes. - Tea? - Yes. Would you like me to serve? No, thanks. I have no legal commitment. The only responsibility of my work is taking care of the woman's body and avoiding the succession of misfortunes that come from an unwanted pregnancy. ...the reward of sharing with our loved ones the fruits of having a better life. Freedom gives you rights and duties. - Hi, Iri! - Hi, Mati. - How are you? - I'm fine. I brought you this for the lab. I'll need it for tonight. Is it ok? Sure. It must be Fillmore. Listen, someone called from the nursing home. It seems your mom felt faint, but she's better now. They called today? No, last night. They left a message on the answering machine. Did you call them back to check on her today? No. I just got here. I was waiting for you to call back again. Are you stupid, Matilde? I'm going to see her. I don't know when I'll be back. - Hi, Irina. How do you do? - Hello. Hello, Iri. How are you? Fine, how is my mother doing? She's an idiot! I told her not to call you. She threw up last night, so we had to call the doctor to check on her, but everything is alright. No, you have to let me know. What did she eat? The usual: black pudding, caviar, a glass of bitter... Something light. I don't know what they had for supper. Well, find out what she ate last night. I need to talk to the doctor that saw her, and all the exams she took. But everything is fine, Iri. No one throws up out of boredom. One can see she's not your mother. Irina? Yes, mom. How do you feel? Something hurts? Did you eat some junk food? What happened? Nothing happened. What could have happened? I felt sick and threw up. Being pregnant is horrible. Don't remind me about that or I'll puke again. Are you sure you didn't eat something? - Irina? - Yes. Is that you? Yes, mom. My daughter? Yes. You're such an intelligent girl, why are you asking such stupid questions? Don't talk to me like that. I ask because I care. Will you let me sleep, please? If you're here I feel like I have to take care of you. I can't sleep, I can't sleep. I'm really sorry, I had a family emergency. I'll be with you right away. Thanks. Call Dominga and let's start. Hello? Yes. How are you? Fine, thanks. No problem, I'm not in a hurry. I'll leave the sheets hanging. Hmm. Fine. She's there, cutting papers, the poor girl. No, I was just saying she must be suffering, right? I'll give it to her. I'll tell her, too. What is this? Irina said you should take it. When is she coming back? She just called to say she'll be late. She'll be around an hour late, more or less. Thanks. Do you need something else? Can I get you something? No, thanks. Thank you very much. Have you been doing this for a long time? Since I was little. Can you show me a finished one? No. Before I left the lodge, I burned everything. I don't know how I didn't burn the lodge as well. Well, you'll show me one later. Pill. 12/7. Put her in position. Thanks, Dominga. These are recent, not from 4 months ago. What? Please. Yes, I do that to myself. You hurt yourself inside, as well? No. Can you control this? Yes. What medicine are you taking? None. And before? Thorazine, Librium, Valium, Dalmane and Ativan. Are you harming yourself elsewhere? I stop hurting myself a few years ago. Thanks to medication. Why did you stop taking them? I'm alone, without anyone. I don't have either money or desires. I don't care, I don't want to be a mother. I need money. I need somewhere to stay 'til we do the exchange and I get what's mine. This place is great and I have the doctor nearby. It is perfect for me. And for you? All the tests came back normal. I'll ask a couple to come on Friday so they'll get to know you. Since you're not giving me any insurance, I'm going to offer them something. This means I'll lose a lot of money if something goes wrong. Is that clear? Yes. From now on, you will do everything I tell you to, because I don't feel like losing a lot of money. Don't wear panties, and while you're healing avoid scratching the area. Get dressed and go to your room. We'll meet for dinner at half past seven. Good afternoon. Hello, Ortiz. Come on in. Fine. Here's the information, Irina. Tell me. Carla Patrici. She has no banking debts, no clinical records in any hospital in the area, no property titles in her name, and the address on her ID is an old, abandoned house. What do you think? I don't know. She doesn't look too fucked up. Oh, Graciela told me the price of potassium is increasing, Irina. If you want, she can save some at the old price. How many boxes does she have? Fourteen, she said. Yes, everything. This is the check for last month's payment, plus the extra you paid. I'll give you the other one tomorrow. Good. Perfect. Ok, I'll let Graciela know. Thanks. Be careful with this girl, though. See you tomorrow. Oh, the clothes! What happened? Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine. What are you doing here? Nothing. I came to help. Give me your hand. What are you laughing at? Don't laugh at me, right? - Tell me about the rape. - What? Yes. Were you alone? Where did it happen? First you slap me and then you treat me with respect? Please forgive me. Were you alone? Why are you asking? For medical reasons? I'm a child born of rape. I don't know how but they got the key to my room at the lodge. I woke up with a gun pointed at my head and a hooded man shushing me. He gestured for me to take my clothes off. He lent the gun to another man and he raped me. I couldn't make a sound. Not yell, anything, because if someone came they would have killed me. Did any of the men wear any protection? I don't know. Did all three ejaculate? What did they do next? They left. I closed the door, blocked it with all the furniture, and stayed there for a while, alone. After that, I went to another lodge and stayed there. Now, I am here. How could you afford the lodge? The owner was a lesbian. Are you a lesbian? Are you? Carla! Hey! What are you doing? For God's sake, are you crazy? I'm sorry, sweetie! Put your hand over here. Take it away. I don't care if you want to hurt yourself or whatever it is, but you can't leave any marks. Don't be silly. I won't tell Irina this time, but if she finds out, you'll be back on the streets. Clear? When will Irina be back? Today is Thursday, she stays here. In the operating room. So... they come today? Who's coming? No. What's wrong with you, Carla? Are you taking medication? I just told you it's Thursday. They come tomorrow. Sorry. You have to be ready at 7 p.m. Is the first time a girl stays here like me? Without an insurance? No. You remind me a lot of another girl, Vicky, who was like you. How can I say...? Dreamy, like an artist. A very nice girl. So? So what? How did it go? How did it end? Very well, as usual. How else could it possibly end? That girl was taken care of, the adoptive parents were really happy. She was very happy, too. She had a boy. Ok, that's it. Take care of yourself. Don't be stupid. The doctor is busy. Have you brought the exams? Perfect. Come here, please. Sit down. I'll go with you. When the door opens, please go in. Ortiz! When Ortiz comes to this house, we eat stew. Always. I'm glad. You should come more often. I come when I'm invited. I always invite you. Stop whining. And stop looking at the girl, creepy old man! Hey! She could be my daughter! Yeah, sure, play stupid. Be kind with your sweetie. Great, the only thing missing! What happened? What did I say? I'm sorry, Ortiz, forgive me. I got scared. Where are you going? If you have any problem, like fever, please, call us immediately... I'll come back. What do you do with the remains? There's a pathogenic waste room for that. The doctor takes care of it at night. How does she do it? Besides her honor medal in medicine, she also has a PhD in chemistry. Great. But how does she do it? Well, I don't know that much. You should ask Irina. Irina? Carla! what did I tell you? Have you seen Octavio? Octavio rapes. Octavio rapes. He raped Silvia. She was alone. Shush, Mom, we're in a chapel! Don't shush me like that! Are you going to be there, when the future parents come? No, I only open the door. Then I leave. No one has to be here. And how do the clients get here? How do they know you do abortions here? Here we don't do that kind of stuff. I'm telling you that motherfucker is a fucking rapist, like all motherfuckers in this fucking world and beyond! Ok, you're right. Julieta is stealing my food. The other day she took my jelly. She chewed it with her gums and then gave it back. Don't worry, I'll talk to her. She won't do it anymore. Don't even think about it! She'll kill you. Is this fine? Close your eyes. I'll come for you. You look beautiful. You're lovely as always. It is Perla who looks lovely. So elegant. If someone says you're elegant, you stop being beautiful. No, no, no, elegant and beautiful. Shall we? Please take a seat. Let me tell you a little about her. Carla Patrici. She got pregnant with her boyfriend, and like so often, as soon as he found out he disappeared. Was he in politics? Politics? No, he doesn't even know what it is. A Don Juan. She decided not to keep it. She doesn't have any insurance. But if we agree and move along, I'll be taking care of the insurance. I'm really convinced that she's perfect for you. Carla. Roberto, Perla. - Hello. - Hi. Well, as we all know, this is always awkward at first. So let's get to the point. Shall we? Carla, 29 years old. She's in perfect medical condition. The fetus is healthy. This is a great opportunity for you, so please, don't be afraid to ask anything you want. Where are you from, Carla? From Pehuajo. Like Manuelita, the tortoise! Yes. And you? Where are you from? - From San Isidro. - You are. I'm from Pilar. I said it to make it easier. Yes, I know, but I want to make it clear. We're not a cake, we're two different people. You're right, my love. - Do you have money? - Here? No, no, generally speaking, so you can bring up the baby well. Yes, of course, we have more than enough. Our situation is really comfortable. Stable. And we're so excited to adopt a baby, so we can give it all our love. Yes, we're super excited. What do you do for a living? You look like a dancer, or an actress or a model. No, nothing like that. I'm just studying. What? Law. You're intelligent, as well! Alright, we should look to the papers. Yes, good idea. I'm sorry, I left my glasses in the car. I'll go get them. Okay? Show him the way to the door, then you're free to go to your room. Please, after you. And the father, what does he look like? Do you know him? Just by picture. Very athletic, handsome. She's really pretty. Yes. Strong and healthy. Everything is going to be perfect. You are very lucky. Yes. They gave me this device at work. It means I need to make an urgent call. Can I make a short phone call? Yes, of course, come this way. There it is. I'll be right back. Let me go, son of a bitch! Get out! Thank you. We have work to do. What is that place? That's Perla's office. Did you smoke? Yes. Don't smoke, it hurts the fetus. - You put them in there? - Yes. - They won't fit! - I told you. We have work to do. What are we going to tell Dominga? She doesn't come on Saturdays. Today is Saturday? What are we going to do? About what? We stick to the plan. What about this? We cut it up and we put it in the pot. This will take all day long. Why don't you go? - No, I'll stay. - You have to get some rest. Is that acid? Potassium. Alkaline hydrolysis. Does it burn everything? It accelerates tissue decay. What about the bones? Let me do my work or leave. What? I'm sorry. Can I sleep here? No. Friday, 2nd of August. Today I took care of a patient who was severely compromised by a home abortion. Destiny has unexpected ways. One week I had to kill a rich girl and her rapist husband, the next I'm saving some hopeless poor girl. Irina! The alarm is ringing in Pathogens room! I'm coming! Hello. Hello. What's that? Go to bed, you need to rest. - I might lose it? - Yes. Actually, it wouldn't bother me. If you lose it, you're out. - May I stay in your bed? - No. Do you prefer I lose it and leave? Stay. Have you seen my notebook? My diary? No. I can't find it. - Do you have many of them? - Yes. Hidden. You look like a little girl. Are you a virgin? I'm really asking. Are you a virgin? I don't know if I want to talk about that. I told you about my rape. Why did you kill Perla? You first. Yes. I think I did it a little bit for you, because you saved me. Also, because when I saw you murder... Where are you from? De Pehuajo. And you're also in law school. Seriously, where are you from? From Ernestina, a little town in Veinticinco de Mayo, which is already a small place. Do you have many siblings? No, only me and my little brother, Ismael. Is he alive? I think so. I hope so. I don't know much about him. - Did you fight? - No. I've always been screwed up. I liked to hurt him. I don't know what happened to him. Are you stupid?! Listen to me carefully, Carla. I don't care if you're crazy. But if you keep doing things that hurt the baby, I'll kick you out and you'll never come back. You know I'm being serious, right? Do you understand? I'm sorry. Do you want coffee or tea? Please come here. Did you put on some make-up? A little bit. How are you feeling? I don't feel quite well. Do you want a back massage? Yes. Fine, come here. Mom, wake up. Momma, let me take you to your room. Mom? Mom? Mom? Momma! Momma! THE ATTACHMENT DIARIES I want to go with you. No. How long will it take? When will you come back? I don't know, it's a funeral. I don't know how long they last. Two, three hours. I don't know. Can you have a funeral on a Saturday? Are you coming straight back here? Carla, please! Let me get you a glass of water. No, thanks. Well, I want one. How is Isaac doing? Annoying, as usual. He wakes me up earlier every time, scratches the door, goes out, walks on the roofs. He misses you. I brought your pills. No, I can't take any. How are you? Fine. What are you planning to do? Are you coming with me? Are you sure you can drive? Yes, positive. Wouldn't you like us to go with you and stay for a while? No, thanks, Matilde. - Do you want me to go tomorrow? - No, Dominga. Thanks, please stop. Calm down. Mom, forgive me! He rang the doorbell, said he worked for the electric company. I told him to come later. I went to the garden and he showed up there. He grabbed me by the hair, pulled me inside... Started to tell me how beautiful I was, and all those horrible things. Then he said: "You're pregnant... If you scream or try anything, I'll kick your baby out!" So I tried to do everything I could to make it soft for the baby. Wrap everything in the white cloth. We'll throw it out later. What about his I.D. and everything? I got them. Give it to me, I'll take them. No, I got it. No, give everything to me. I'll put all together. Yes. Ok, here it is. You stay here. You should be resting. If you need anything, just yell and I'll come running, ok? Thank you very much, Dominga. Irina, do I show Fillmore in? Give me a minute. I'll let you know when. Send her in. Thank you. How are you, Irina? Fine, and you, Miss? Since when do you call me "Miss"? Sorry, I have a headache. You're not pregnant, are you? Get out! And don't you dare to come back. - Sorry? - Get the hell out of here! And then you hit me. I never thought we would end like this. Don't you ever think about those people? Which people? The assholes that broke in here and raped me? No. I hate them. I'd kill them again. What about the last one? Did he hurt you? The last one was the worst. I was disgusted by him. It seemed that he wanted to make me suffer more than he wanted to enjoy. And you seemed to have a great time hitting him once he was dead. Really, you're very good at this. - Do you enjoy it? - What do you mean? C'mon. My mother hated me. When I see a man, I see a rapist. At the same time, when I see a rapist I think of my father. Who is it? - Ortiz, could you come down? - Yes. Good morning, Irina. Good morning. How are you? I heard about your mother. I'm really sorry for your loss. It seems there where some hidden things last time we checked. It's ok, no problem. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Eh, Irina... - What? I really mean it, I'm sorry. Whatever you need, please count on me. Thank you very much. Hello? This is a message for Jorge Katerva. Tell him to call Ortiz. Thanks. Hello? Yes, Katerva, what's up, old man? Let me give you a number. I.D. number 5065698. Check everything you can. Yes, I'll be expecting your call. Thanks. Estela Junco? Fuck! How did they clean her up so good? Well, the guy was a cop. He had all the right connections. The weird thing is that he fell in love with her, really hard. He left the police and took her to his house. And what did she do? No one knows. Everything vanished. Something serious, for sure. At least one dead body. Just a girl, right? What a mess, man! Take the address. - The cop's address? - Yes. Perfect, Katerva. - See you then, take care. - 'Til next time! Did you mean to hurt them? Yes. Why? I hate them and they scare me. So I want them dead. What would you do to them? Nail something to them, see their blood, kill them all. Kill them? Yes, hurt them a lot. Are these pictures from the same day? Yes, yes. They were taken at the shrink's session. "...scenes of violence, "motivated the consultation with a psychiatrist that... "...the diagnosis, according to Bowlby's research, "would indicate a reactive attachment disorder. "It's common among people who "have suffered early childhood abuse, at least to three years old..." Dominga. Dominga! I don't know what you thought it was, but this is another thing. I didn't think anything, Irina. Why would I? I'm not gay. No, come on! I don't even know what you're talking about. Good. Keep not knowing what we're talking about. I was just leaving. I was only going to drop some towels in the room-- Are you awake? Yes. Are you ok? Yes. Uncomfortable. Why did you tie me up? Why did you attack Dominga? Because she was going to hurt you. No, we were just talking. No. She was going to accuse you of being gay. You were going to lose all your patients. They're going to revoke your medical license. And who knows if she wasn't going to accuse you of doing abortions and send you to jail. No. Yes. Or at least those were the risks, and I couldn't let that happen. Why? I don't know. Because you're my girlfriend. I'm pregnant with your baby. We're going to have a child. We live together. You are my home. You're everything I've got. I know everything. About what? Everything, Estela. Everything. I know that you called Esteban... I don't think Roberto raped you... That you have a house... That you like to hurt... That you've been sick since you were a girl... That if you are not properly medicated, you are a danger to society. And now that I have proof of this, I realize... That you don't need any reason to kill. You do it because you like it. But you love me, right? Yes. What are we going to do then? There is a treatment. So far, it has only been tested on children, but I've been doing some research and I believe we can go ahead. It's a form of systemic therapy that I brought from United States. It rehabilitates the damaged attachment through minor stimulation in the conflict area. Will I heal? Rehab your ability to feel that atrophied attachment, probably by some kind of severe abuse in you early childhood, right? My dad. We are all born with a primary need of attachment. Babies cry, yell, gesture searching for love. When instead of affection it receives aggression, the subject develops a shell. A shell that will carry all its life, and it will prevent it from having proper relationships except through pain and damage. What we need to do now is bring out Carla's hidden pain. Bring her to the breaking point of her rage, of violence, of despair, and at that point you show up, Irina. To calm her down, hold her, be there for her. In this way, we will slowly rebuild the damaged attachment. It's a matter of reconnecting impulses with representations. It's a very difficult treatment. Painful, violent and deeply distressing. But the truth is that it is the only option you have. - Do we endanger the fetus? - No. Doctor, let me ask you something. Did I suffer from the same thing? No, you didn't. Your mother was a horrible person, seriously traumatized, but she was there for you when you were a baby. Are you in love? Yes. We'll do everything we can. Thanks. - Can you untie me so I can eat? - No. I never had sex before, and this is the first time I'm in love. I get excited because I'm going to see you later. I miss you after a minute spent without seeing you. That's why I'm going to follow to the letter what the doctor says, like it or not. But I want you to know this: I'd rather kill you than let you leave me. Is that clear? What are you saying, Irina? Just that. I won't endure feeling jealous, thinking you are with someone else, unable to sleep, not knowing where you are. I'll kill you. What if this treatment doesn't work? Ortiz, what did you do?! He was treating her, he's a doctor! Are you ok? I'm fine. This stupid man splashed me! Calm down. Calm down. - No! - Son of a bitch! You don't do that to a pregnant woman, Irina! What's going on? I don't know. I got scared and I want you beside me! And I'm glad that you killed this son of a bitch! I don't want you to leave, because I'm afraid you may never come back! What are you going to do now? Call the cops? Not if we don't have to. Ok, help me then. I'm thinking of something. Get her out from there and bring her here. As soon as the steam runs out, throw everything here. - It will blow out the pipes. - No. It won't blow shit. - What is it? - I have to tie you up, Irina. - Give me your hands. - No. Listen, I have a lot of respect for you, don't make me hurt you. - Give me your hands. - Ortiz, stop being an idiot! What are you doing, Ortiz? I'm going to clean the wound you forced me to make. That I made you do? Don't be stupid. - Filthy girl! Pervert! - Dominga! What did we say? How could I have known? Doctor dyke. I gave you my whole life! Here. Do you recognize this? Hm? What is this? Blackmail? You can't see anything. Besides, I can frame you and Dominga as my accomplices. "I perform abortions on a mission to help, "out of hatred of men, "out of hatred of my rapist father, "and at the same time out of love and revenge. "Destiny has unexpected ways. "One week I had to kill a rich girl "and her rapist husband, the next I'm saving some hopeless poor girl." What do you want? The baby, the house, your office downtown, and all your savings. You're a respected professional, Irina. It won't take you long to have money again. We will allow you to live here-- under strict supervision, of course-- until the child grows up. Carla will breast feed the baby every time it's necessary, and then we'll take it from you. When the baby is six months old, you will leave. You will leave for good. I don't care where. You must know my answer is no, right? Look. You're both going to jail. They will separate you. Carla will be miserable, because she will be constantly raped and she will end being an inmate's or a guard's girlfriend. She will get over you soon enough. Your destiny won't be very different. You cannot even imagine the situations you'll have to face. Hell awaits you, my dear. The worst kind of life you can think of. You have two choices: either you do what I say, or you kill yourself. As you are deeply and madly in love, suicide is not an option, and you won't leave Carla alone. If you ever think about killing yourself, I'll make sure Carla gets hurt, really bad. What's going on, sweetie? You can go if you want, I'll take care of this. I'm staying. Look, we'll do this. I'm going to lock you in your room and I will keep Carla tied up, without food or drinks for two days, to let you think. Come on, let's go. Let her go! Carla, don't be silly, you won't do anything with that. What is it, Carla? Carla, what's going on? Let's see how big is this love. Stick it through! Go ahead, do it! The baby was born naturally and in perfect health. I imagine that Dominga and Ortiz raised it devotedly. Carla and I wandered until we came here to live far away from the rest of the world. Given the situation, we are just fine.
