(CHILDREN CHATTERING) (VIOLIN PLAYING) * Do re mi fa so la ti do * Do ti la so fa mi re do -Bye, Dad. -Bye, Em. Oh, come on. I just had it. It's got to be here. Hey, honey, did you see that, you know, the Stainer file? GREGORY'S MOTHER: No, I haven't. GREGORY'S FATHER: Well, it's gotta be around here someplace. Wait a minute, hold on. (GREGORY'S FATHER GRUMBLING) I am so late. Oh, boy. Okay, all right, got everything? Got the file? All right. Okay, sport, you have a good day, huh? -Happy birthday, Pops. -Thanks. (SNEEZING) (MEOWS) There you go, Dixie. You're safe with me now. ISABELLE: My darling Jordan, I've missed you so. I've returned from camp early. It was just too infantile for a 14-year-old like me. Life is complicated when you look like Claudia Schiffer. Ta-ta for now. Jenny. (GASPS) ISABELLE'S MOTHER: Come on, Isabelle, honey! Let's get that care package mailed off to your sister. Just a sec, Mom! (GRUNTING) Hey. Cute, huh? Aunt Lisa gave it to me. It's lame, Mom. No offense. I'm running to the market. And remember, we're going to the mall later. Tiny Sprouts. Uh-huh. Okay. -I'm outta here. Love you. Bye. -Bye. (DOOR CLOSES) (STATIC HEARD FROM TV) LAUREL: Pull it up. No, up. (GIRLS GIGGLING) Dearest Emily. We thought we'd begin by giving you an update of the goings on at camp. See, we've been here for about a month now and we've realized something. Basically... We rule this place! BOTH: Yes! Pull it back, you invalid. (GIGGLING) You see, while you've been training for your position in the midget symphony... Oh, my. We've been doing some rigorous training of our own. (GIRLS GIGGLING) I think of it as a warm up for my in-person, up and coming encounter with the e-mail man. (GIRLS GIGGLING) And we think it's crucial that you, too, change the focus of your summer studies. You remember Harold, that loser with the buzz cut who we saw eating his own snot at the life saving movie? GIRLS: Ew! Well, check out Harold, one year later. Emily! Emily, my heart aches for the vision of your beauteousness. I heard you're developing into a beautiful young woman and Harold! That's enough. Less is more. (WHISPERING) Call me. Anyway, just get your hiney back here for the last two weeks of camp. You'll still be able to brush up for your audition when you get home. And that, Emily Lind, is the master plan. Love, Laurel. And Jenny. P.S. GIRLS: Wwhap the o wit wwa! Hit it, Jane. -JENNY AND LAUREL: Bye, Emily! -GIRLS: Bye! (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) (GIRLS SHOUTING) I love you! (WHOOPING) (SIGHING) 35 days until the Swamp Thing is expected to hatch. Today we're shopping for its bassinet. I mean, personally, I think my old rabbit cage would serve the same purpose, but the mother-to-be thinks not. I know. Here's the progress on the wounded toenail. (IMITATING TODDLER) It's much better. And, this is the piece I'll be playing for the Youth Orchestra, The Mendelssohn. It's what my teacher Pauline played to get into the symphony. Now, it requires a ton of work and I really don't think there's any way I'll be able to get up to camp this summer. But about Harold... (CHUCKLING) Just for fun, I'd sort of like to know if he plays an instrument. And don't worry. Even though distance may part us, I'll still never forget. Wwhap the o wit wwa! Okay, goodbye! Bye. GIRL: Oh, here she is. (KIDS MURMURING) -Hello, everybody. -ALL: Hi, Emily. Okay. All right, Lea, you're first. (KIDS CHATTERING) Divulge your secret. I found a kitten and I named her Dixie and she's living in my room. But the thing is, I'm not allowed. (SIGHING) See, my sister's allergic, so I can't tell her. But I had to tell someone. Did you get kitty litter? (CAR APPROACHING) Philip, look at all those kids. Those are toddlers, Mother. I am a pre-adolescent. I'm counting down for take-off. Congratulations. Where to? China. (WHISPERING) I'm digging there. You'll be my contact here at base. Your codename is SK-14. Once I've departed, you'll have to deliver a message to my parents. Tell them I'm safe but not where I've gone to. Can I count on you, SK-14? Your secret's safe with me. This is Jenny's. I gave it to her. Can it be re-strung? You saved my life when you repaired my mom's antique broach. Don't worry about it. Jenny never wears it anymore. When she gets back from camp, she'll never even realize it's missing. -Anything else? -Yeah. You're the best. Is it still stealing if you use the money to buy a present for the person you stole it from? Gregory, what did you do? Got my dad cologne at Greenbacks for his birthday with the money I stole from his wallet. EMILY: Next time, you should make him a gift. Parents love that stuff. Anything else, Gregory? (SIGHING) I used the change to buy candy and I'm not allowed to have anything besides fruit juice Gummy Bears. So I hid it in my sleeping bag case. Then you have nothing to worry about. Parents snoop under drawers and mattresses, so your hiding place shows a stroke of brilliance. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! We just moved here, sweetie. Let's wait till next week to destroy it. Go upstairs and unpack, okay? -Hey, Philip. -Hey. Mom! Oh, Mom, I can't find my tennis shoes. Look harder, David. Dad, I've looked everywhere. He can't go to tennis camp tomorrow without tennis shoes. Just give me a sec to find my keys, okay? (BELLS CHIMING) (GASPING IN AWE) (GASPING) Oh. Oh. Look at the little bears. (WOMEN CHATTERING) (CRYING) (BABIES CRYING) (WAILING) Emily, which one do you like? I'm trying to think neutral since we don't know the baby's sex, but... This one. But I'm getting really claustrophobic. -I'm gonna go wait outside. -Oh. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Excuse me. My mom abandoned me in a linen sale. I'm kinda lost. Can you tell me where the escalators are? Well, it's kinda complicated, so listen carefully. Take about ten steps that way. (CHUCKLES) Thanks. (SIGHING) Hey. Do you play an instrument? Yeah, the harmonica. Checking out the neighborhood. Bye. (SIGHING) Oh! Oh, nature calls, sweetie! Can you grab the stuff out of the trunk? I'm not gonna make it! (SCREAMING) Who are you and what do you think you're doing? (SIGHING) None of your business. Of course it's my business. These are my mother's roses. What is this? It's nothing. It's a knight, part of a chess set. Looks expensive. Irreplaceable. Well, I have news for you. There are certain things that make sense to cover up, like drinking glasses, dishes, maybe costume jewelry that's rarely even worn, but if you think your parents aren't going to notice a piece of their precious chess set is missing, you're wrong. They'll think the movers lost it. They'll be upset but they won't be able to blame me. Well, if you want to properly conceal the evidence, you better come with me. Come on. -I'm gonna need your name. -Philip. Did you just say "fill it up"? No, I said Philip. Like P-H-I-L-I-P. You mean, Philip. Where'd you get that strange accent? (PHILIP SIGHING) Chicago, I guess. Interesting. I'm Emily. A mill-o-what? Like a millimeter or a millipede? I don't get it. Emily, like Emily Dickinson or Emily Bronte. (CHUCKLES) Who are they? Only like the most famous female poet and author ever to live. (SIGHING) Anyways, you owe me 50 cents. -For what? -My services. I've labeled your item in case you ever need it back. (SIGHING) Okay, there you go. (SIGHING) Wait, is there like tons of broken stuff in there, of other people's? Oh, is that what all those kids were doing today waiting in line? They tell me their secrets, which often involve broken merchandise. So, like, how does somebody become a professional secret keeper? See, when I was little, I didn't know anybody who could keep a secret and I've never spoiled a secret in my entire life. So I knew it was a marketable skill. Anything of yours in there? Oh, come on! You know my secret. Didn't you just hear me? I said I keep secrets, I don't share them. Especially my own. Well, the girls look like they're having a great time at camp. I'm not so sure about Harold, but I think you ought to consider going up there next week. One more. I don't believe you, Mom. You watched my video? Well, you left it on the coffee table. I was curious. Mom, that's worse than reading my mail. Well, I'm sorry, Emily, I didn't know. And rather than try and ship me off, why can't I get some encouragement for what really matters to me? Emily, you have our encouragement. Can I please be excused? I have to change. Kurt Bestor is conducting Innovators in the Washington D.C. concert series. It's live on PBS. Samuel Cardon is the guest performer. Neil's already on his way over. We're watching the Braves. I thought you knew. Yeah, but I've been planning this all week. Can't you watch it someplace else? And where do you suggest we go? I don't know. A sports bar? Bet you'd let your new child watch whatever it wanted whenever it wanted. Emily. Hey, why don't I tape the concert while we're watching the game? I know you can do it. You just... I know it can be done. It's not the same if it isn't live. (SIGHING) And whoever heard of a family that only has one TV. (DOORBELL RINGS) Please be home, please be home. DON: I can't believe this. ELAINE: It'll turn up when we unpack the rest of the stuff. Or find that missing box of photos. Or all of David's tennis clothes. The set's over a 100 years old. You know what that's worth? Probably those packers. Come on, Don, worry about it tomorrow. Pop the champagne. Let's christen our new home. Hey, look on the bright side. Burglars could've stolen the whole thing. (DOORBELL RINGING) -Hello. -Hi, I'm Emily Lindstrom. I live next door. Maybe Philip told you about meeting me today? What are you doing here? You didn't tell us you made a friend already. Come on in. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) I'm Elaine, and this is my husband Don. -Emily's our next door neighbor. -Oh, hi. Hi. It's extremely nice to meet you. Uh, listen, this might sound a little odd, but I was wondering if I could borrow your TV? I mean, not actually take it, but just watch something on it. And the thing is, the program is just about to start, so, well... Well, we don't have cable yet but we can set up the TV with the rabbit ears. Come on in. I don't get it. Don't you have a TV? It's being hogged by my dad who thinks the Braves are more important than the Washington D.C. concert series. You hear that, Phil? That means classical music. -(MAKING RETCHING NOISES) -Philip! Don't worry. I wouldn't expect your son to appreciate fine music. DON: When Phil's nana passed away, she left him her baby grand piano. I've been trying to get him to take lessons for the past two years. So, Emily, do you have brothers and sisters? No. Yes. Soon. See, my parents always wanted another child after me but my mom wasn't able to get pregnant. Um, now at 40-something, the miracle baby is on its way, so... Well, we have Philip, here. He's 12. Twelve and a half. And David's upstairs packing for camp. He's 15. -And you're... -14. Oh... Oh... I got it. Oh, channel 11, please. Okay. (CHATTERING ON TV) There you go. Shall we? (CHUCKLING) Oh, I didn't mean to intrude on your first night in your new home. Oh, no, no, Emily, it's a pleasure having you. If you were 21, we'd invite you to toast with us. ELAINE: Come on, honey, let's get back to work. So, what're you doing? Well, normally I wouldn't tell a total stranger, but since I'm in your house... I like to pretend that I'm in the symphony. I get the piece and I practice all week and... You'll see. Can you hold this? MAN ON TV: Live from Washington... Why don't you just get into a symphony and... Shh. MAN ON TV: Kurt Bestor conducts Innovators. (ORCHESTRA PLAYING ON TV) (LAUGHS) Who's this? Shh. Yeah, nice to meet you, too. (GASPS) I'm in love, Pauline. Samuel Cardon is a dream in concert. That's not love, Emily. (CHUCKLES) True. I have stronger feelings for Kurt Bestor. Maybe we should shift your focus from musicians to music. The Mendelssohn, to be precise. -Oh, okay, just one more thing. -Mmm-hmm? I... Well, I don't know if this is asking too much... -You sounded great. -Thanks. But is there any way you can pull some strings and maybe get me into the concert? We could go together and we could visit your old friends backstage and then maybe I'd get to meet Kurt? I wish I could, Em, but I kinda used up my favors for the year. -Let's begin. -Okay. (PLAYING VIOLIN) What's up, Fill-it-up? Well, David's gone off to tennis camp, my mom's doing decorating stuff and my dad started his new job. It's tough being the new kid. So, what do you want me to do about it? I don't know, take me downtown, show me around. Afraid not. I was just going in to practice. Don't you have to take a break once in a while? All right, I'll tell you what. Do you want to come in and join me for high tea? I do. But what is it? (PIANO PLAYING ON RADIO) A lot of musicians take time out for tea in the afternoon. When my mom's gone, I like to use her china to make it more decadent. One or two. Two. -May I? -Yes, you may. Okay. Cheers, Philip, darling. -Cheers. -(GASPS) Well, looks like you get what you wanted after all. You'll come into town with me and we'll replace the cups. -How much money do you have? -Almost 50. Good. Bring it all. We'll split the cost. Guess we share a secret now. Yeah, I guess we do. SALESMAN: Is there something particular you are looking for? Yeah, the pattern I'm looking for is called Crown Darby. Oh, shame. We've discontinued Darby. Maybe I can suggest my personal favorite, Regal Royale, instead? -Follow me. -Sir, it has to be that particular pattern. Oh, I see. Has there been an accident? Well, can you call another location? Place a special order? Send us to an estate sale? (SIGHING) Want to know the best kept secret in town? No, my mom is very anal. She'll know. So, I'll go home and tell her the truth. -Hey, what does anal mean? -She is fussy. Well, as long as she doesn't turn it over she'll never suspect. It comes in a set of four including the saucers, for $14.99. We only need two cups. With you in my life, the extras should come in handy. Yeah, they're lovely. We'll take them. Ready? PHILIP: So, what are we gonna do with the extra money? (VIOLIN PLAYING) (ALL CLAPPING) -Is he good? -He's good. (CHUCKLING) (MAN WHOOPING) Wow! (CHUCKLING) Thank you. (ALL CHEERING) Thank you. (CHUCKLES) Thank you, I had a blast. Come on, I wanna show you something amazing. This is it. Woo! This place is... Woo! In ten years, this chair will be mine. Ten years? You've already proven your talent. Why don't you just cash in like that guy we saw? Become a street performer? My aspirations are a little higher. Plus, my parents would never allow it. They'd be mortified. Are your parents really as awful as you make them sound? They just don't get me. Maybe they're not your real parents? Why would you say that? Oh, well... You might be one of those switched-at-birth cases. Truth is... I mean, all they seem to care about lately is the baby. (CHUCKLES) You know, I mean, there's about a million things I find more interesting and about a zillion things I'd rather do than change a diaper or something. Hmm. Like watch Kurt Bestor conduct. You know, we still have money left. Why don't we just get tickets to his concert? It sold out months ago. Emily. Do you think you could ever fall in love with someone who wasn't a conductor? Actually, I wouldn't mind if he were a pianist. Then we could play Mozart's violin and piano sonatas. It would be so romantic to make music together. A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Got it. Now, I need you to teach me this piece, Mrs. Neiderhoffer. Oh. (CHUCKLES) Well, I thought we'd start with something a little more rudimentary. (SCOFFING) Not if you want to get paid. -Oh. -One more. Ooh, that's good. Oh, guess what, Em? We're throwing a party and we'd like you to help plan it. What's the occasion? Well, sort of an end of summer combo barbecue bash block party baby shower. Right in the front yard. You mean, you're gonna throw a party for a child who hasn't even been born yet? Can't you at least wait for its first birthday? Well, baby showers are a tradition, Em. You know, people bring little gifts. You know, stuffed animals, mobiles, bwankies. (LAUGHS) So are you telling me this is going to be the most spoiled child ever to walk the face of this earth? You know, speaking of spoiled children, Emily... Well, this spoiled child would like to eat dinner in peace. Emily, come back here. Honey. We're doing something wrong. (SIGHING) It's not just us. She doesn't tell us anything. She's so secretive. -You know what we should do? -Hmm? Tell her a secret. Let's each tell her a secret of our own. (MEOWING) They are so pretty and soft. And you are sure this is cool? They are like total animal lovers. Thanks. (LEA READING) I can't wait to see the pictures. I have good news. (READING) We'll finally get to meet like we have planned. I'll be at your house next Wednesday at 2:00. Holy Guacamole! LEA: I'm kind of in a hurry, Emily. (KIDS CHATTERING) (SIGHING) Okay, who's first? MIKEY: Me. I'm aborting my mission. I never thought of you as a quitter, Mikey. A shift of focus, SK-14. I have reason to believe that we're not the first society to inhabit Cedar Street. But if word gets out, anthropologists could take over my plot. I don't know who can be trusted these days. Except for you, that is. Well, I've been emailing Jordan. He totally buys that I'm Jenny and everything. And now he's coming to meet me. I mean her. I mean, do you think I could pass for 14 in this outfit? Why are you in such a hurry to grow up, Isabelle? Because being nine stinks. Not as I remember it. Anyway, that's no excuse for spoiling this for your sister. So, why don't you email Jordan, tell him your entire scam and plead with him not to tell Jenny? Explain to him that it could put your life in danger. Jeez, Emily, I could've thought of that! Don't you have a better idea? Like what, tell him that she died? Dixie got a sister. Noreen. I was at Greenbacks stocking up on litter and there she was. A lady was just giving her away. Are you sure it's not a boy? Well, how am I supposed to tell? Well, if Dixie gets pregnant, that's a way. Then it would be a dream come true. I better start planning for their future. I'll keep you posted. Ants! Get rid of the candy, all of it. And then go to the market and ask for Raid. And while you're there, get yourself an airtight container for future stashes. I recommend Tupperware. (CHUCKLES) Go, go. I want to share a secret with you. Oh, yeah? You want to find out what we're having? Is that its face? Well, no. No, actually, that's its butt. Then stop calling it "it." Tell us! You know, having your first child in your 40's is truly a remarkable thing. Beautiful, isn't she? (PAGER BEEPING) If you ladies will excuse me for a second. I'll be right back. Caroline, everything looks real good. -I'll be right back to check on you. -Thanks. You told him. How could you do that? He's my doctor, Emily. For health reasons, he has to know. It's my first successful pregnancy. What if he tells somebody? I don't know why you think of your adoption as such a negative. We always said you could tell on your own terms. We never thought that would mean not telling. It's my secret, Mom. I intend to keep it that way. (SNIFFING) What do you think of the name Pauline? I've always thought Martha was a nice solid name. Mom, that's terrible. How about Elizabeth? They'd call her Libby, or Beth. Or Lizzy, or... Grace? (WHISPERS) Grace. (VIOLIN PLAYING) Can I come out? You know, this tortures your mom, you know. She thinks you're gonna tumble to your death. I love it out here. I... Came out here to tell you something about myself. A secret of my own. What's up, Daddy? I'm scared. Scared of being a new father at 50. You sure don't act like it. Does Mom know about this? Emily, this is a miracle baby. And the last thing I want to do is to make your mom feel unsure about my commitment, or the love that I have to offer a newborn. And your mother is much younger than I am. I'm gonna be an old man by the time he, or she, goes to college, gets married, you know, all that. This baby's gonna keep you young. That's what it's gonna do. I'm sorry that I've been so impossible. I'm really gonna try and be more accepting. Shall we? (SINGING IN TUNE WITH THE VIOLIN) Ladies and gents... The Whit Wha Rap. Let's do it. (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) * I'm Laurel * I'm Jenny BOTH: * Here's where Emmy should be * Wwhap the o wit wwa * Come along Come along * Wwhap the o wit wwa * We're together So together * Yeah, together we'll be * What does the wit wwa mean? * It's a secret, you'll see * What does the wit wwa mean? * Don't you dare ask me BOTH: * We miss you so much * Now that we're two not three * Wwhap the o wit wwa * We're together forever * Yeah, together we'll be -We love you, Emily! Whoo! -Bye, Emily, we love you. -We love you. -We miss you. BOTH: Andalay, andalay, more eah, eah! BOTH: Uh-oh! LAUREL: Oh, and Emily? BOTH: Wwhap the o wit wwa! - LAUREL: Whoo! - JENNY: Emily we miss... You've got to tell me what that means. What are you doing here? We had plans, remember? And the door was open. So, what does "wit wwa" mean? That's between me and my friends. (SIGHING) I'll do anything. No, Phil, it's personal, okay? So just drop it. If you do me a favor, maybe I'll forgive you for invading my privacy. (PHILIP SIGHING) I bet it's a scrambled word. I'm good at figuring out that kinda stuff. Would you just drop it? You're really starting to bug me. All right, do you know how to use a camera? This is the 21st century. I can edit, too. Okay. Introduce yourself to my girlfriends at camp. Hello, ladies. My name is Philip, a.k.a. Fill-it-up Lenox. New kid on the block, and I will be filming the virtuoso today. The Mendelssohn. Bravo! Wow! How'd you like that, sweetie? Gonna grow up and become a musician like your big sister, huh? Wow. I don't know what you and your husband are planning but I think that more than one child per family is irresponsible. Emily, I loved having brothers and sisters. I used to play for my baby brother every night until he was about five. -Really? -Yeah. But children of my own are not in the near future. Oh, no, Pauline, you have to have children. It would be genetically predisposed to be a prodigy, you know, or at least first violin in the symphony. I heard Kurt Bestor comes from a lineage of Irish accordion players. What's wrong? Maybe both of us should forget about Mendelssohn and Bestor and the symphony for a moment? Yeah. Try this. (PLAYING BRAHMS' LULLABY) That was really wonderful, Emily. -I heard that's how Mikey Chang got so smart. -Hmm? His parents played vocabulary tapes to the womb. But I have a feeling that Grace will be a flutist. Wit, whap, wap, the o wit wwa. Whaa... Why... -(PHONE RINGS) -Heh... Heh... Heted. -Hello? -Itch... -Witch... -David? David, slow down. (GASPS) -(DOORBELL RINGS) -It's just so unlike him. He's... That's Emily. We have plans. Why don't you tell her it's not a good night, Phil. No, no, it's okay. Phil, go ahead. So, what are we supposed to do? Can we go get him? No. David's okay, that's the important thing. He's okay. Come here. (SIGHS) So I realize I have a massive responsibility. I mean, the baby's gonna need guidance from somebody who has a clue about pop culture and stuff and that's not gonna be from Eddie and Caroline. Hmm, but the thought of it is still making you want to barf? -You can tell? -ELAINE: Phil? -Oh. -Oh, do you guys want a slice? No, thank you, Emily. We're gonna take a walk. What's going on? Nothing. Yeah, right. Well, it's a secret. Do you really want to know? If it's okay with your parents. Okay, we'll make a deal. You just have to tell me the mystery of the whit wha in return. Forget it. It's a big-time secret. After I tell you, you'll feel obligated. Try me. Okay. My brother's getting kicked out of tennis camp. No way. What did he do? Well, he and some other guys sort of borrowed the camp van. They got beer somehow, but David said he only had one. Are you serious? Was David driving? No, the other guy was. And I guess he wasn't really drunk, according to some tests, but he doesn't have a driver's license. And that's not all. They hit someone head on. David's not hurt, but this woman, she's a waitress, she broke a couple of ribs and totaled her car. My parents don't... They don't want anyone here to know because they think David will get a bad reputation. He'll probably be grounded for life. He should be thrown in jail. David wasn't even driving. What's the difference? He let his stupid friend drive drunk. Jeez, Emily, they didn't kill anybody. They could have. (SIGHING) So, I guess it's a big enough secret to give me your side of the bargain. Emily, it's not that big of a deal. It is to me. Why are you so freaked? It's not fair. You owe me. (SIGHS) We will help and promise to help each other wherever in the world we are. Are you happy? -What? -That's what it means. We will help and promise, W-W-H-A-P is wwhap. If you take the first letter from each word, it works. It's not even grammatically correct. We were eight when we wrote it, okay? It was just a stupid secret. But you had no right to tell me about your brother. Wait. You're not gonna tell my parents I told you. No. But you should know something, Philip. A person that will do that once will do it again. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Gregory? -What? Um, yes? -I bet you'd like some of these yummy Gummy Bears, huh? Look, baby. They're on special. Why don't you get three, baby? Go ahead. One's enough, Mom. Oh, you are a good boy. -(CAT SCREECHING) -Gotcha! Hi, I'm Jordan. Is Jenny home? She's... Already dead. I'll leave these on her grave. And if you really want to mourn, I'd cancel your online account. That way you could stay loyal to Jenny forever. Goodbye, now. -(SNEEZES) -Gross. MIKEY: They're totaled. Excessive bleach caused the holes. Next time, just add one cup and wash on medium heat. -You got it? -Over and out. I got another one. -A kitten? -Actually, a cat. A black one. The Josephsons didn't care about her. She was always outside and stuff. You kidnapped Midnight? Midnight is so ordinary. I renamed her Laticia. But they have signs up all over the neighborhood. You have to give her back. You can't force me to do anything. And you better not tell on me. Ethically, I would never breach our confidentiality, but if you don't let her go, you can't be a client of mine anymore. Be that way. Fine! But... I'm never gonna steal from my dad again. Good for you. It's easier to steal straight from the store. So, why are you telling me this, Gregory? I gotta tell someone, right? This isn't confession, Gregory. I know. But what I was thinking is whatever you want, I'll steal for you. It's kind of fun. I earn my spending money. We have to write the obituary by 6:00 so we can run it in tomorrow's chronicle. You seriously told him that she died? It was your idea! -I didn't mean it. -So now you tell me. Look, Isabelle, you're gonna have to tell Jenny what happened. This is not fair to her. But she'll never speak to me if she finds out. It'll be like being an only child. Fine, then I'll tell her. Some secret keeper you are. I should have never trusted you. Okay, I won't tell. You're right, Isabelle. I can't tell. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Hey. -Hey. (SIGHS) Who were you expecting? My friends. They just got back in town. Can you just forget what I told you? You are the one that keeps reminding me, you know? Okay, so I won't talk about it anymore. Hmm, I think I'll go for the chamomile. So, we are reuniting, so it's like girl's only. Oh! I get it. Ah. Do you mind putting this on the booth on your way out? So, I'll see you, okay? Yeah. See you. EMILY: Wait, I thought you kissed Harold. Well, I did. But then I met Benji. So she decides to drop Kip and hook up with the big H. As far as I'm concerned, it was a waste of time. It meant nothing. I was doing it all for Jordan so that I'd finally have some experience when we met. What'd he do, go for another subscriber? Worse. He's not even online anymore. He just vanished without a trace. He didn't even say goodbye. Oh, Emily, I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. There's plenty more where that came from. The Greenbacks' special. Wwhap the o wit wwa. Don't you think we're getting a little too old for that? Yeah, but who gives? You seem different, Emily. Did something happen this summer? No, no, nothing happened. I thought you were grounded. I'm allowed to come outside, Phil. And besides, what could Mom and Dad possibly take away from me? There's nothing to do here. -LEA: Here, kitty. -See what I mean. -(CAT MEOWING) -Here, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty. No wonder you settled for that weirdo violinist next door. Dad said she was coming over to watch a concert tonight. I can hardly wait. Nice shot. Go get it, man. It doesn't matter anyway. She's a flake. She'll probably forget. (BICYCLE APPROACHING) Are you the violin player? No way! I'm David. Her name is Emily. -Like Emily... -Dickinson? And Emily Bronte. Didn't I see you at the mall? Yeah, I think. When? Oh, well, you probably have to get back to your lesson, huh, Emily? Yeah, I do. But we'll see you later, right? For the concert? No, I'm not gonna be able to make it. I'm sorry, Philip. Man, she is so pretty. I don't think so. Her hair hangs in her face. You're too young, man, you can't see it. Wait a minute. You like her, don't you? Emily? I don't think so. Give it up, buddy, you're 12. David, you got it so wrong. All right, then you won't be upset when I make my move. Of course not. But you're the one who should give it up. She's, like, in love with some middle-aged composer. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) GIRL: Hey! -Excuse me! -BOY: Yeah, she's so late. Can't you guys read? It says, O-N-V... It says, "On vacation," you illiterate. That's right. In case you guys haven't realized, I have a life. What am I supposed to do with this? That's up to you. I just have to get rid of the stand. Who wants to give me a hand here? I need to tell you something. Let me guess. You dug up some human remains in the field. But they're not human. Let it be your own secret, okay? What's going on? I need to get rid of this stand and nobody's willing to help. Where to? (CHILDREN MUMBLING) -Over here? -Yeah. All right. (GROANS) So, what is this thing, anyway? Uh, I'd rather not get into it. "Secret Keeper," huh? So, I could tell you anything? I'm not in business anymore. Well, I don't have to tell you a secret. We could just hang out. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. I appreciate your help, but I just... I told my mom I would go someplace with her, so... (VIOLIN PLAYING) Okay, what's up? What do you mean? I mean, why was this piece almost mastered two weeks ago -and suddenly... -I just have a lot on my mind. Put that down. Come here. So, let's talk. I can't, Pauline. It's a secret. Well, whatever it is, I highly encourage you to resolve it before Monday. Why Monday? Your audition. Oh. Tell you what. How about I meet you at your house on Sunday for a run through? See if you can sort out what's bothering you. Okay. Oh, yeah, that'll be perfect. And you'll already be at my house for the baby shower. Oh, and you better be prepared to sign some autographs. I already told everybody in the world that you used to be in the symphony, and they're dying to meet you. I'll see what I can do. You know this piece. The next couple of days, I just want you to relax and have some fun. Okay? Yeah. Hey. Shouldn't you be playing tennis or your harmonica or something? I got a lot on my mind, so I'm taking some time off. Well, I wouldn't want to take time away from your time off. Emily, wait. Is this about Philip? No. No, it has nothing to do with Philip. It's... I happen to have a lot on my mind, too. I've got this big audition in a few days and I've never played worse. Not that I can totally relate, but maybe you're getting distracted by all the outside stuff. The competition, that weird business you have, or your mom having a baby. When I play tennis, I don't focus on the opponent, or that fight I had with my parents, or any of that bull. It's not about that. You just need to concentrate on the music. So, what got you started in all this, anyway? (SIGHS) Um... When I was six years old, I started ballet lessons and I stunk as a ballerina. But they played this music that was just extraordinary. And I thought the only way I could hear it is if I kept going to class. And then we all went on a field trip to see The Nutcracker. And you saw the orchestra. In the pit. And I was just drawn to the violin, you know, it excited me. The manipulation of the bow, the crafting of the instrument. So I quit ballet lessons, I got a violin for my birthday and I started my lessons after that. Come on, get off your bike. We can walk home together. No, I... I really have to go home and practice. I'm sorry. So let me get this straight. You think it's a Tyrannosaurus. Shh, keep it down. Excuse me. (CHILDREN MUMBLING) What are you doing? Well, I've cashed in on the basic economic principle. Supply and demand. I thought you'd be happy. I mean, I'm like your protege. 75 cents! That is robbery. It's called inflation. Plus, I give free lemonade. But this is such a scam. You don't have any credentials. As if you did. Yeah. As you were saying... (PEOPLE CHATTERING) -(KNOCKING ON THE DOOR) -Come in. Hey. Why don't you play for our guest today. Mom would love it. I don't know, dad. You could use a dress rehearsal, couldn't you? Okay. I'll tell mom. Hi, Jordan. You getting enough to eat, buddy? So, when is this baby due? Two weeks from yesterday. -The last weeks just fly. -Yeah. As I'm sure you remember. -Hey. -Hey. A babe in the hood. I can't believe it. Save yourself from the inevitable pain. -Stay away from him. -Oh, come on, he can't be that bad. She's right. That's Philip's brother. He's bad news. Oh, and he is just my type. Just to let you know, I was forced against my will to come. If it would have been up to me, you never would have been invited anyway. And I know for a fact that the only reason Gregory came is for the cake. -And Mike... -I really couldn't care less. Whoa. Em, what happened? These kids used to idolize you. Even Isabelle didn't want to come today. Did something happen between you guys or something? -Why don't you ask her? -Em, why don't you go get your violin? Well, I want to wait for Pauline to get here. After we open the presents, everybody's gonna leave. Pauline will understand. -Hey. -Hi, Mrs. Lindstrom. So, this is my competition, huh? What are you doing in here? I wanted a clue. I don't get you. Well, what you see is what you get. Well, I'm about to play a piece for all the guests. Maybe you'd like to come to the front yard and watch with everybody else. You don't even realize you're pretty, do you? No. I mean, I'm not. Why do you always turn away? Because you're an idiot. I know about the accident, okay? Philip told me. You know, for an herbal tea, citrus spice is pretty zesty. -Excuse us. -Ow! PHILIP: Dude, what did I do? EMILY: David, stop! You were never supposed to tell a soul. -Tell what? -He only told me so I would tell him a secret of my own. You promised never to tell anyone you knew. I trusted you. "We will help and promise to help each other wherever in the world we are." She told me your stupid saying. I'm sorry. (SOBBING) DAVID: Emily! Emily! -(KNOCK ON DOOR) -Emily... Emily, can I just explain? EMILY: Go away! CAROLINE: Emily. Em, there's someone here to see you. No, Mom, nobody comes in. (SIGHS) (KNOCK ON DOOR) PAULINE: Emily, it's me, Pauline. Can I come in? -Just you. -Okay. I know all this stuff that I can't stand knowing. I told something I swore I never would. I have a secret nobody even knows about. Secrets hurt, hon. You have no idea. Yes, I do. I have one of my own. I don't wanna know about it. I think you should. Emily, I didn't wanna leave the symphony. I was let go. I'm sorry. When you're third chair for five seasons, you start to realize that you're not exactly a principle player. So they brought in some new musicians from Julliard and that's when they suggested I should leave. Well, maybe you can work extra hard and make a comeback. Oh, no, sweetie, it doesn't matter anymore. I love being a teacher. But I guess I just felt a little ashamed by how that came about. I should have told you. But your admiration, it just filled me up. Falsely. Keeping it from you was wrong. It's held me back in many ways. You can't keep secrets about yourself and lead a true life, Emily. And you shouldn't encourage others to do the same. Pauline, I have a lot of explaining to do. What? Are you gonna make an announcement from the rooftop? No, I left my violin out there. That's another story. But we're still gonna rehearse, right? I mean, in case you've forgotten, I have an audition tomorrow. I'll deal with my announcement after that. Pauline, do you wanna know why you're my role model? Because of your discipline, your talent and your poise. And I will get into the symphony. And it'll be mainly because of you. My mentor. (GASPS) (INAUDIBLE) (SIREN WAILING) She'll be okay, Phil. She will. (PANTING) I am a liar. You didn't mean any harm, Philip. No, I am a liar. I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to know it was my fault. I'm sorry. VOICE ON PA: Paging Dr. Peters... Please report to Radiology. Here's some more water. -Here you go, sweetie. -Thank you. It's gonna be okay. -(SOBBING) -Oh, come here, girls. She's gonna be okay. Come on. She's gonna be all right. Hey, Philly, Mom's taking us to the hospital. No, we have something more important to do. Come on. -Hello, may I help you? -Hey, Isabelle, we gotta get something in Jenny's room, okay? Phil, wait! (SIGHS) Where are you going? (PANTING) Tape? No. What are you looking for? Got it! (MUSICIANS REHEARSING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) -Hi. -Hello. We're here to check in for Emily Lindstrom. Um... So, if you just watch the tape, you'll be convinced. Emily is the most amazing violinist you could find for your orchestra. All cued up to go. Even if this tape does show talent, when we audition someone, we like to try to find out about them. We ask them where their passion comes from and why they were inclined to choose their instrument. Do you remember the first time you saw The Nutcracker? (WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA) Ooh! Honey, what is it? -Oh! -Oh, my gosh. It's the baby. It's the baby. Oh. I never even asked her why she played. DOCTOR: Good. (SCREAMING) Good. Keep pushing, Caroline, you're doing great. Caroline, you're doing great. Push. Okay, okay. -DOCTOR: Don't forget to breathe. -I'm good now. -I'm breathing. -DOCTOR: You're doing great, you're doing great. -(CAROLINE GASPING) -Mr. Lindstrom. Emily's okay. -She's awake. -Oh, God. -(CAROLINE SIGHING) -NURSE: Only a concussion. She's gonna be fine. Oh, thank you. (BOTH SOBBING JOYFULLY) DOCTOR: Okay, Caroline, here we go. This is it. Push, push hard. Push. Almost there. Just about. A little bit more. -(BABY CRYING) -Okay, you have another beautiful daughter. Oh, she's beautiful. Way to go, baby, you did it. You did it. And we were sitting there. Nobody knew what was going on. And we were all there totally devastated and freaked and your mom's water breaks. -No way. -It was like this bizarrely good timing at such a bad time. Wait, what time is it? I missed my audition. It may have been a great experience, but you have many years ahead to play in a symphony. Yeah. I'm sorry if you're disappointed I blew our secret. No, forget about it. The only thing that matters is what it stands for. Hey, Millipede. Hey, Fill-it-up. Hey. Hey. We knew you were gonna pull through. Unfortunately, a little late. Well, uh, David and I just got back from Symphony Hall. It's not a sure thing, but, uh, we gave them the tape, the one I made of you playing the Mendelssohn. It was Philip's idea. You're brilliant. Yeah, well... David won them over with the story about your ballet classes. CAROLINE: Hello. -How's our girl? -Oh! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Where's Grace? Oh, she's getting some tests. Does she look like Emily did when she was born? They wouldn't know. I was adopted. My biological parents were hit head on by a drunk driver. I was in the back seat. Apparently it's a miracle that I lived. I was just a baby. Ten months old. I never even knew them. It was always easy to keep my secret because we moved from Minneapolis when I was six and I threatened I'd run away if they ever told anybody. Well, you found other reasons to run away. But I'm really glad I came back. All right, troops. Everybody out. The doc's on his way in and he's gonna give Emily some routine tests. -EDDIE: Okay. I love you, sweetheart. -I love you guys. -CAROLINE: We do, too. -ALL: Bye. -JENNY: Bye. -Bye, Em. -PHILIP: Goodbye, Emily. -CAROLINE: I'll bring Grace back, okay? -Okay. -EDDIE: Bye-bye, Em. Um, so, what happened to the drunk driver? He served a year. Not even a month later, he got in another accident. That time he killed himself. I will never do it again. Never. I... I wish I knew what to say to make you believe me. I mean... Eventually I would have just told you myself. 'Cause if you wanna be close to someone, you can't keep secrets from them. Hey, Emily, how we doing? Let's see what we got, here. Bump on the head, huh? Wow, you did it. With a little help from my friend. And his adorable big brother. (SIGHS) This is very cool. But there's still some unfinished business. We'll go to everybody on the list and give them an ultimatum. You really think we can convince all of them to give back the broken pieces and stuff? You did it, didn't you? Plus, under the condition that they fess up, I'm gonna give a refund. Where you gonna get that kinda cash? Well, Pauline is on her way over with a loaner violin. (PEOPLE MUMBLING) -Whoo! -Yeah! Beautiful! WOMAN 1: Bravo! (PEOPLE CHEERING) PHILIP: Thank you. -Great. Thanks. -WOMAN 2: Excellent! -PHILIP: Thank you. -WOMAN 3: You sound great! EMILY: Yeah, I have some ideas for you. Now, you tell the manager of Greenbacks that you stole from him and volunteer to sweep the fronts and clean the windows as a payback. And maybe you can think of something to work off the $20 from your dad. Now, if you do all this, I'll fork over a major refund of $5. You just have to pitch in $15. All right, what have we got in there for Gregory Jones? Gregory. One broken wristwatch. -Gregory. -Let's see. -One stained button-down. -Oh. Gregory. One crystal bud vase. Gregory. And, ooh, a jade figurine. I'm dead meat. Okay, Isabelle, here's my proposal. You tell Jenny the entire story. I'll even take some of the blame for planting the idea of her death. And it's a long shot, but maybe we can do a missing person search on the Internet and try and find Jordan. Might as well get it over with. Well, I guess we can forget about doing your inventory. But if you face your demons, we're looking at $21 cash back. I'm sorry, Emily. If I didn't have Jenny, I would want you to be my sister. Grace is lucky. All right, Lea. If not for the Josephsons, do it for your sister. I heard she's been in bed with allergies all summer. She's allergic to the air, Emily. It's not my girls. JENNY: Wait a minute! You did what? That sounds like it's going well. Anyway, Lea, I talked to my parents. They said that I could adopt Dixie. You can visit her whenever you like. And Phil said he'd talk to his parents about Nadine. Noreen. All right, what have we got in there for Lea? I'm not accident prone. I'll drop Dixie off this afternoon, but you better take extra good care of her. Well, maybe you can show me how. JENNY: Sorry, guys, we're taking cuts. Can you really help me find Jordan? First things first. Um... Where's the trash? I mean, my mom barely even remembers this Wedgwood box. I was like seven when I broke it. It's the point. JENNY: I didn't break this. It's my necklace. (EXHALES) I can't believe her. When will she stop? Oh, you guys, I still have some clients waiting. Oh, sorry. Well, we'll catch you later. EMILY: Okay. Wwhap the o wit wwa. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye, Phil. -Bye. Wait a minute. Where's Mikey? I thought you said everybody agreed to come. Guess Mikey will come by to pick this up later. Thank you, Philip. I really couldn't have done it without you. Neither could I. Could have what? Learned how to play piano. I'm just beginning, but I think I'm gonna be good. Well, when you're ready, we'll play the sonatas. As long as you're not too busy with symphony rehearsals. No, I'll make time for you, Philip. Always. (SIGHING) Friends? The best. She's all yours. Thanks, buddy. And David? I'm not too young to see it. You know, I never thanked you for helping me get into the symphony. It's just... I don't know how to. Because I've never kissed anybody before. Thought Mom could use some tea while Grace is napping. Oh, good idea. I think I'll join her. That is a good idea. You know what, Dad? Let me tell her. Oh, by the way, Em. Something came for you today. It's up in your room. *
