Dad! Dear God. Dad? Dad! Chloe! Where's Dad? I don't know. Dad! Dad. It's okay. Are you okay? Are you okay? Oh, you okay? Where's Dad? Oh, I don't know. Dad! Dad! Dad! Where has the boat gone? I don't know. Dad! Dad! Dad! Oh, thank God. Are you okay? Are you okay? Thank God, thank God. It's okay, it's okay. - You okay? - Yeah. You okay? Are you okay? Yes. Where has the boat gone? Why would they leave us? We're gonna get through this, its' gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine, just calm down. Just calm down. Stay calm, stay calm. It's okay. Don't worry, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Just keep calm. It's gonna be okay, I promise. It's gonna be okay, just keep calm. They know where we are. Just, just keep calm, it's gonna be fine. Guys, there is something in the water. Where? Where? Over there. It's okay. It's okay, just keep still. It's gonna be fine. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Lexy? Lex. Yeah. How did you sleep? Any better? Same as always. Well, I'm going into town if you wanna come. You should get out more. Come on, a little bit of retail therapy might help. No, it's okay. Thanks though. Okay. Well, I will see you later. Hello? Good afternoon, is Mr. McKenna there, please? Uh, hello? I'm calling from Hamptons HiFi. A while back Mr. McKenna expressed an interest in the new range of speakers... Daddy! You feeling any better about things? I have better days, I'm just tired all the time. And what about a job? Have you thought about anything you could do? And voila! Now, well, that's better, isn't it? Thanks. Mm-hmm, pretty good if I do say so myself. Okay, I have gotta run. So... Well, now that your nails are looking all glamorous, I was thinking... No. Do you want to go to party with me tonight? Come on, Lexy, just a few people. You know, some foods, some drinks, maybe Cards Against Humanity, you love that. Come on, look, I'll drive, and then if you really, are really not enjoying it, I can just bring you home. Oh, I don't know, I just... Please? Please, Lexy. Just try it. For me? I just want the old you back. You know that fun, outgoing Lexy. I know she's in there somewhere. Please. Please. Oh, okay. Okay, so I will pick you up at 8:00 and you'll be dressed and ready, yes? No lounge wear, okay? Eight o'clock, I'll see you later. - Bye. - Bye. Ms. McKenna. I know this has been extremely traumatic for you. Please, in your own time, tell us what you remember from that night. I, uh... Remember us all being on the boat, five of us. It was early evening. We just opened a bottle of champagne and we all had some. Were you celebrating? No, not exactly. It was hot, and we'd been playing around in the sun all day. It all went to my head. The alcohol you mean? Yeah, um... And then it was dark. I vaguely remembered dancing with my dad, and my sister. Your sister, Chloe. And then, I was, I was dancing, I think. I tripped up, I lost my balance. Take your time, eh? It's okay. They were on the side of the deck. I grabbed on to them to stop myself falling and... I sent them into the water with me. It's all right, it's okay. It wasn't your fault. Ms. McKenna, I appreciate this is extremely difficult for you, but you really are helping us to piece together the events from that night. So then all of you, yourself, your father and sister, you all fell into the water. And again, in your own time, tell us what happened from then on. Chloe. All right? It's fine, you're okay. Okay, get on. All right? You're okay. Breathe. All right, now, I need to go have a look. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. I'm gonna go under, I'll be right back. I won't be long, I promise. You'll be fine, just stay, stay here. - Breathe. - Okay. - Yeah? - Okay. I'll be right back, I promise, okay? Okay. Just stay still. Chloe. Chloe! Chloe! Chloe? I'm here. Oh, oh my God. Oh my God. I thought I lost you. Did you see where he went? No. I'm so excited. And you look stunning, you're gonna turn some heads. You said this was a small thing. Yeah, small work-ish. Lex, come on. It's all the people you know. You know Brandon, except me. - Come on. - I can't. Please, just for a few. - Please. - I'm sorry. Hey gorgeous. How you doin'? Sorry, did I wake you? I'm okay, almost through another day. Come here, that's not the attitude. It's not getting any easier. I still can't sleep. Are you having nightmares? Yeah, you were thrashing around a lot last night. Did you get your nails done? Yeah, Amy did 'em. Tried to drag me to a party. Tried? Yeah, well, maybe next time, eh? Hey, I know something that will cheer you up. I brought us Chinese. Come on, you're always in the mood for Chinese. Yeah? Okay. Come on. Hi. Hi Amy, you all right? I'm good, you? Yeah, not too bad. Can't complain. Life goes on. Yeah. Does she know you're coming? Oh, no, I don't bother texting her anymore. I know she's more likely to say no. Yeah, makes sense. I mean, I hope you don't mind me just turning up. I would hate to intrude. Oh no, no, not at all. I mean, it looks like she's here for the long haul. So it's her house as much as mine. I suppose it is. Well, anyway, I'm off out for a prescription. So she's in the lounge. Thanks. Hi. Not disturbing anything, am I? What's that? Daytime quiz shows? Hmm, have you learnt much? Figs contained dead wasps. That's disgusting. Where did your nails go? You scratched them all off. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. They're your nails, you do what you like with them. Just glad I didn't go to the trouble of waxing you. Look, there it is, there is that winning smile of yours. Lex, listen. Babe, look at me. I've been thinking, and, I've seen you over the past couple of months and, I don't think you're getting any better. And after last night, look, I really think it would be a good idea if you spoke to someone, got some therapy, I don't know. I've done some research, and I found out that the NHS, they offer counseling for people with PTSD. I think that's what you have, Lex. I know it's soldiers that often get it, but your symptoms are the same. I really think you should speak to someone. Right, do you remember Jason? Yeah, the guy who was in the car crash when his friends died? I heard he had counseling and it really helped him, Lexy. I'll even drive you to the sessions. I just, I really think you should consider it. Baby, you need to speak to someone. Please. Look, I'll pass you on the details, okay? Please. So I'm thinking about seeing a shrink. Really? What's made you decide that? Amy suggested it. I had to wait ages for them to even get back to me about my physio. And then it was six months before there was an appointment. They really weren't very good. Yeah, all they're gonna do is just, tell you what you wanna hear, feed you these little white lies that just make you feel better, but, I mean they can't change the past. You can't change what's happened, Lex. They'll probably just put you on more medication. Hey, but it's, it's your choice. If you want to go for it, we are right behind you. But in my opinion, the greatest healer is time. I'm sorry. So sorry. Hello, welcome to The Oaks. Our working hours are nine to five, Monday to Friday. Please call back then or leave a message and we'll try to get back to you soon. Hey. Come in. Hi. Lex? Yeah. Please take a seat. You don't like doors being shut. Don't worry, it's quite common. I'll just leave it ajar, that way you won't feel like you're being closed in. , isn't it? Yeah, thanks. So, thank you for coming to see me. My name is Francesca, but you can call me Fran. And you are Lex? Yeah, or Lexy, whichever. Short for Alexandra? Yeah. There was a boy in my first year called Alex, so I was Lexy since then. So now we know each other's names. I'd like you to perhaps tell me a little bit about you. Maybe a bit about your family. Okay. We moved to the US when I was pretty young. My dad got a job. We were there years, I mean, we grew up there. Long story short, we came back. My mom never really felt at home there, you know? And then she... It's okay. I know it's hard, but it's good to talk. Mom died about three years ago from a brain tumor, was very sudden. I just think those things happen to other people. It was such a shock. Sorry. Dad stayed so strong. I don't know how he did it. Your mom would've been so proud of you two today. I'm proud of you. You're both so strong. This will go by now, strong for each other. Become better people 'cause that's what we are, we're good people. We will get through it, I swear. It's gonna be hard for all of us. But we'll grow stronger for it. He was the most selfless person I've ever known. He always put us first. I wish I could've met him. Shall we take a quick break? Do you fancy a cuppa? How about a biscuit? I bet you're a chocolate bourbon kind of girl. Custard scream. Ooh, my own personal favorite. So we have a bit more time. I'd like to move on to the events of the day if that's all right. You don't have to go into too much detail, maybe just a bit about who you were with, the way you were, that sort of thing. We were in South Africa on our first family vacation, since dad remarried. - What was her name? - Vicky Dad actually wanted to go to the Caribbean. Vicky wanted South Africa, that's why we went there. And where did you want to go? Oh, I don't know. Maybe the Caribbean, I didn't mind it. Vicky insisted that my boyfriend came too. Your boyfriend? Yeah, Isaac. We'd been together about six months at the time. Dad really liked him. So five of you then. One day we chartered a boat, a small cruiser, nothing too fancy. Isaac has a license, so he took us out. It was such a beautiful day. We played around in one of those inflatable boats off the side, had a few drinks. Lex. Lex. Was it really that bad? Yeah, well I'm sure it's gonna be difficult to start with. You did have a pretty traumatic event happen to you so... I know, I was there. Sorry. Just, you just gotta stick at it. Don't let the first session put you off. They're only trying to help. Come on, let's go. You were gone a long time. Did you go anywhere nice? For a picnic. A picnic? On your own. No, with Amy. She had the day off. A little bit chilly for a picnic, isn't it? She brought hot chocolate, so it was okay. Yeah, this takes the edge off. Can I have some wine? I thought you couldn't have it with your medication. I stopped taking it. But didn't the doctor say to carry on for a lil' longer? I did, for two months. Are you gonna pour one for me and Isaac? Yeah, sorry. There he is. Drinking wine? Seems that I am? Whoa, go easy. You know the effect it can have on you. Thanks, Vicks, it was delicious. You're welcome. How was your day? Yeah, pretty good actually. I had a meeting with a new client. They weren't sure the deal was gonna go through but I went in, cranked the old charm, and job done. Well done. Knew you had it in you. How was your day, Lex? She went for a picnic with Amy. A picnic? In this weather? That's what I said. Must be pretty tramautic the way you're drinking that wine. Time for bed, madam. You're gonna regret that second bottle of wine in the morning. Not tonight. I'm knackered, okay? You're drunk. Maybe tomorrow, eh? Yeah. Get some sleep, you're drunk? Goodnight. So last week, we talked a bit about your family and later on in the afternoon you started drinking. Yeah. What time is that? Five-ish? Yeah, probably. And whose idea was it to start drinking? I don't know. We had a ton of drinks in the ice box, so it was gonna happen at some point. And would you say that you usually drunk a lot? Well, I wasn't long out of university, so. I remember those days. So you were all having fun on the boat. Yeah. Dad likes, liked to have a party. Oh my God, how much have you drunk? Wait, oh, hey, wait. - What was that? - What? Do they have dolphins here? Why? I'm sure I saw a fin. Get us out! Get us out! Get us out! Get us out! Lex. Lex, listen. Look at me. I can see that you blame yourself. Sometimes things just happen. There's no reason for it. Universe is just a series of random events. It was my fault. It was my fault we fell in the water. It's my fault they're dead. Please don't think like that. You're here, you survived. Sometimes I wish I didn't. Okay? Thanks. Anytime. Don't give up now, I'm sure you're making progress even if it doesn't seem like it. Okay? Amy. Jesus. Not quite. What are you up to? Oh, nothing much, just a bit of gardening. I had the afternoon off. How was your picnic the other week? Picnic? Yeah, Lex said you went on a picnic last week. No, I... Oh, sorry, the picnic. Yeah, it was, it was good, thanks. Where'd you go? Just somewhere local, a park. What'd you eat? Sandwiches, nibbles, you know, picnics things. What kind of sandwiches? Look, I'm really sorry. I've got to head off, so I'll catch you later, okay? Okay. Bye. Ms. McKenna, I'm going to show you a couple of photographs. This is the dinghy the Coast Guard found you clinging to. Do you recognize this dinghy? Yeah, it's from the boat. And you and the other people on board were playing in this inflatable during the day? Do you recall how the dinghy came to be in the water at night? I think Isaac or Vicky threw it in to help. Hey, babe. Look, I'm really sorry, I've got to cover a shift at work today, so I can't drive you in. Maybe see if Vicky can. Look, I've gotta go. I'll catch up with you later. You know, if you've got health problems you can talk to me about it, you know. Whatever it is, I've probably had it myself or at least had experience talking to people about it. Come on, I'm all ears. It's nothing, I'm fine. - It's just a checkup. - For what? A scan, it's nothing. All right, well, you know where I am if you need me. Thanks. You're not pregnant, are you? Oh God. No, definitely not. Good. There maybe another reason why you reached for the alcohol. It's common for people who've suffered a traumatic experience like you did, for them to try and recreate that experience in order to prove to themselves that they could stay in control. It's forward catharsis. Now it's possible that you have reached for the alcohol to try and prove to yourself that you can stay in control. And that maybe there was another element that meant that it wasn't your fault like you've so far believed. What, so you think there's something more to it? I'm suggesting there might be another reason why you started drinking again. I mean, you told me you could handle your drink in the past. You told me that it was a hot day and you were expending plenty of energy swimming, having fun in the dinghy. It's possible that you were lightheaded, dehydrated, thirsty. You had a couple of glasses of champagne. Now the bubbles make the blood absorb the alcohol more quickly. I know if it was me I'd be more than a little lightheaded. Possibly, but I still never black out like that. Even when I'm really wasted, I remember everything. Even when I don't want to, it's kind of annoying. Well, there's a first time for everything. Happens to most drinkers eventually, although there is usually a combination of things which would make you black out. There was something in my drink. You think your drink may have been spiked. Maybe. Well, that is a strong statement. I mean, do you have any reason to think that anyone would try and drug you? No, Dad would never. Chloe wouldn't, not even as a joke. Isaac would have no need to, we were actually having sex back then. And Vicky, I... Would you have had any reason to believe that Vicky would? No. Okay, well, let's go over it again with that in mind. Where have you been? I was waiting for you. I'm sorry, I needed a walk. Well, you could have answered your phone. What? How did we get here? What's going on? I don't know. Where's the boat? It's over there. Help! - Hey! - Hey! Help! We need help over here! Help! Help! - Get us out! - Over here! - Where is he! - Dad! Where is he? Where is he? Dad! - One, Lexy? - No, thanks. Probably a good idea. You were snoring a bit last night. Hey, you oughta get a lil' crack at that gym. You celebrate? You know, that night in South Africa. You mean... The night my dad and Chloe were killed. Yeah. Can you remind me what happened exactly? I just want to clarify a few things. I know I was drinking a lot and, need to remind myself that it was an accident. Okay. Yeah, we hired the yacht. Whose idea was that? I think it was your dad's. Yeah, you know what, so do I. Yeah. Go on. Then we sailed it out off the coast to the shallow waters and dropped anchor. Okay. How far out? How far? A half a mile? Then we dropped the dinghy and played around in it a bit and so on. So you got in it? Yeah, I was in the dinghy with you at some point. Okay. When did we start drinking? Uh... Five, six. Yeah. And we were drinking what? Champagne? Oh, no, sparkling wine. Local stuff. It was quite good. Yeah, Dad poured that, right? Yep. And then? Then we played a few games, you know, card games and so on. Who won? We all won. Yeah, I mean, we weren't exactly keeping track, so. And we were all drinking? Yeah. Okay, so after the, the first glass of champagne, who gave me the next one? I don't know, it was, it was quite a long time ago. Lex, what's this about, huh? I'm struggling to come to terms with it and just want the details. Yeah, but we've told you all of this before. - Nothing's changed. - I know. I just can't understand some things like, how did we end up in the water? You tripped. Lexy, we've been over this, you tripped. You were very drunk. Yeah, very drunk. More drunk than I've ever seen you. We were all dancing around having fun, and you tripped. You grabbed on to your dad and Chloe and tried to use them to save yourself, but just ended up dragging them in with you. You were there, you saw? Yeah, well, I was below deck with Vicky. You just said we were all dancing. We were. Yeah, we were. I mean, you know how parties are, people go off in different directions, different rooms and... Music was really loud on the deck. So we went below for a chat. What were you talking about? It was about the plans for the next few days. Oh, yeah, we were going to go off to Table Mountain and stuff. If you were below deck, how did you know that I tripped? Well, you told the police. If I don't remember, how did I tell them that? You suffered a very traumatic experience, and in a lot of trauma cases, you might remember straight after, but then after that, you're gonna forget. Probably what happened, you told the police and now you've forgotten. And you were drinking. Like drinking affects the memory. I mean, you can blank it out all you like and we can go over the details again and again if you want, but it's not gonna change what happened and it's just... It's not gonna change the fact that it is your fault. Nothing we can say is ever gonna change that. And that's just something that you're gonna have to live with for the rest of your life. It's... Hey. You okay? Do you care? Sorry, I was a bit harsh earlier. You know, you gotta be cool to be kind and all that. Hey, so you got drunk. Everyone gets trashed occasionally especially at your age, and bad shit happens when you drink. And yes, this was very bad shit. But, you've gotta come to terms with the fact that, this was your fault, and nothing we can ever say would change that. - Anyway, I... - What's that? Is that a scar? Yeah. How'd you get it? I don't remember it. Just a work thing, I think it was a cheeseboard or something. Quite a place to cut yourself. Yeah, I mean, I was, I was drunk. I don't exactly remember it, so. Drinking does affect the memory. Anyway, gotta head to work. It's this fucking deal with Japan, I know, it's so annoying. Just gotta go to the office and finalize a few things. So I might be there until the early hours or I might just stay there. Anyway, look at these. I thought maybe they'll help you sleep. You been having trouble, so. Take 'em. Lex. Lex. Wait. Lex, wait! Lex. Look, things haven't been the same since... You haven't been the same and this just kinda happened. It just happened? You won't fucking touch me, is she why? What other lies have you been feeding me? Lex, please, just calm down. - Put the knife down. - I hate you. Put the knife down. I hate you. Okay, just... Fuck you. I fucking hate you. Put the knife down. Don't... Get out! Lex. - Get out! - Okay. I'm going, okay? Morning. What are you still doing here? I live here. Not anymore, get the fuck out of my house. But it's my house, Lexy. Realistically, I could ask you to move out. I mean, you've been living here for these past few months without paying any rent. But no, I've been good to you. Extremely patient. Paid your way while you've been out for work, cooked for you, cleaned for you, put up with your moods. Acted like a mother to you. You're sick. My mother could never do that to me. Oh, sweetie. That relationship died months ago. You didn't really think he was gonna stay with you while you were in this state, did you? It was inevitable. We were just waiting for the right moment to tell you. You didn't just tell me, you showed me. Well, we thought you'd be asleep. Asleep? That's your excuse? Hi, this is Amy Watkins. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Lex! Sorry, have you got a few minutes? I really need to talk to you. I'm sorry, I'm with a client, and I'm... Please, just five minutes. No, no, it's fine. I'll wait outside. Really? It's fine. I'm so sorry, thank you. Lex, this is most... She did it. They fucking did it. Vicky and Isaac, I'm sure they had something to do with it. What? The attack? I've been piecing it all together and the more I think about it, the more, it just fits. I caught, I caught them. I caught them. Oh my God. Okay. Before you make any assumptions or go around accusing anybody, let's go over the facts. Right. The police, they ruled out anything suspicious, didn't they? Yeah. Then you need to be absolutely sure. Let's go through it again. So, Ms. McKenna, I, I hate to ask this, but is there any reason you can think of as to why this might not have been an accident? Not an accident? Yes, any reason you believe that maybe somebody in your party wanted to see you, your father and your sister end up in the water? No, no way. Okay, so as far as your opinion goes, the events were usual. There was nothing suspicious. No, I don't think so. Is there a chance that your drinks might have been spiked? Why? You tell us. We don't know the people involved. You'd have a much better idea than we would. Vicky for example. You said she's your father's second wife. Yeah. What are your feelings towards her? Any hostility between you? I mean, it's weird. I mean, I mean, my, my mom died and she had been there my whole life. I mean, I, I guess I thought it was a little soon for Dad to remarry, but he was happy. It wasn't my place to question that. Going somewhere? Get out of my way. How was counseling? Now be a good girl, and take your pills. No! There you go. Swallow. Come on, get em down, yeah? Swallow. Good girl. Now sleep. Come on, the keys. Oh, fuck. Looking for these? Give me those. Feel familiar? What's going through your mind, Lexy? You feeling lucky? Probably not a good idea to go into the water. You know, it could be anything in there. Crocodiles, maybe a piranha. It's amazing what you can go off the dark web these days. Oh, and in case you forgot what with all the wine and drugs, it's your sister's birthday today. She would have been 20 if she hadn't... Weird things, birthdays, aren't they? People celebrate as if you've made some massive achievement when all you've really done is just gone another year surviving. I mean hardly an achievement, isn't it? Maybe it is. Anyway, I thought I'd pay a little tribute to your sister. So I put together some scenes from her last birthday. No images. Just sound. I'm sure you won't struggle to put the pictures in. That's the great thing about memories, isn't it? You can replay them over and over and over again. Good luck. Oh, please. Please. Chloe! It's okay. It's okay, it's just a pool. You love swimming There's nothing in there. There's nothing in there that can hurt you, he's lying. It's just water. Okay, go. Yeah, Dad, your turn, go. Oh God, stop. You want me to stop? Yeah, stop it. That's awful. Smile, happy Christmas. Okay, hang on. One, two, three. Merry Christmas. Fuck. Okay. Oh, fuck. Come on! You won't get in here. Then come out! Come out and tell me what the fuck is going on. Come on, or I'll... You'll what? Break up with me? You sure as hell won't get out the house. We've got a pretty good setup in it. Plenty of food, and en suite. And of course your stepmom for entertainment. So you'll never escape. There are two ways out of this for you. You can either slowly starve and freeze to death. Go to your memories to keep you company. You can take the easy way out. You have a knife, there's an assortment of pills in the kitchen and we left you a nice bottle of wine, as a farewell present. The choice is yours. Has she done it? We'll find out soon enough. What's the matter? Not what you expected? Surely after all the fun you've had, you should know the reality isn't what our eyes always see. Don't! How does it feel? To lose control of your plan at the last moment? God, that must be frustrating. Plans, I don't know... Please. All I've heard from you is lie after lie after lie. This time, you're gonna tell me the truth. If you want me to call for help, so you don't bleed out on my floor, you're gonna tell me what exactly happened that night. I wanna know all of it. We hired a yacht, took you out into the shallow ends off the coast, got out into the dinghy, snorkeled, enjoyed the sun. And then on board. I remember that. Go on. And then we spiked your drinks, the three of you. And waited until you eventually passed out. I did, I did trip over but it was over Chloe, wasn't it? Yeah. And then? We went out deeper into the ocean, to some area known for being infested with great whites. We threw you out to sea, and left you for the sharks. That's how you cut your hand, isn't it? You got the scar 'cause you were trying to attract them. Yeah, and we slashed the dinghy and threw it out to make it look like an accident. Like you'd drunk and gone out in it. Well, that backfired. It ended up saving my life. And you know, for most of the last year, I'd been wishing it hadn't. But, my God, am I happy to be alive. I'm gonna spend my life watching you two spend the rest of yours rotting in prison. - Don't you dare! - Wait. Wait, I had nothing to do with this. Lexy, I understand you're angry. I know how this might look. It looks like you're an accomplice to murder. I have nothing to do with this. This was all on you. You fucking roped me into this. You're a liar. Let him finish. This happened way before I met you, Lex. I wasn't... I, got on, mowing lawns, and cutting trees, nothing glamorous One of the guys whose lawn I mowed was an old guy. Mr. Randall. One day, he was feeling really poorly. So he asked me to go to the pharmacy and pick up his prescription. So I did. Vicky worked behind the counter at the pharmacy. She asked so many questions, and she was so flirty. Said she hoped to see me again soon. Next thing I knew, she turns up at Mr. Randall's house, tells me to get in the car for a chat. That's where it all started. A few weeks later, Mr. Randall was dead. He left me some money in his well. Fantastic story. What a wonderful imagination you have. Oh, you're fucked. Befriending old vulnerable people so you can fuck with their medication. Well, they were gonna die soon anyway. So it was you who laced the drinks. I am sorry. It was never meant to go this far, it was never... It's a little bit late for that. You're finished. - Get out of my room. - Shut up! Lexy, you don't believe him, do you? It was all his idea. Oh, don't lie to me! I'm not lying to you, Lexy. I never felt comfortable with you. You knew dad had life insurance. With the three of us out of the way, you'd have the money and your house all to yourself. No, it wasn't about the money. And what? Then Isaac came along and, maybe that wasn't a coincidence either. And you planned a little family holiday together. You were so insistent on South Africa, more sharks, right? I mean, it makes sense. It's not true, it's not true. You know what I don't get, you wanna kill me, right? I've been in this house with you for a year. What took you so long? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's make this nice and easy, okay? What do you want? What can I do to make all this go away? I want my dad and my sister back. Lexy, please. Okay, there's something you can do. Sign over the deed to the house. I had my last session today with Fran. Oh my gosh, that's amazing. - Congratulations. - Thank you. So the house, have you decided what you're doing with it? No, I don't think I can let go of it. You're not gonna sell it? No. What, Lex, you'd make a mint. I know, but it was dad's and grandpa's and it meant so much to them, so. So have you heard from Isaac or Vicky recently? Nope. And I don't think I will for a very long time. But hey, brighter days ahead. Should we do a cheers? Okay. To a fresh start. To a fresh start. And more wine. Always.
