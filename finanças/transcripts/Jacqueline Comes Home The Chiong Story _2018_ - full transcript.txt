--== McEphie ==-- Father... forgive me for I have sinned. It's been seven days since my last confession. Open up your heart, my child, and he shall listen. Father... I lied. I've pretended that I wasn't bothered. I've been acting like... like I'm not scared. But the truth is... I'm worried about what may befall to my sister. Sometimes, I play it off as a joke but... I'm actually afraid of not being able to protect her. But, I can't tell her that because-- My child. We cannot protect our loved ones, from all the evil in this world. The short time we are given in this life, let us offer it all to the Lord... until he calls us home. Yes, father. Ma... Ma, could we please eat first? Please, Ma. Ma. Hey, Marijoy! What happened to you? What took you so long? We've been waiting for you outside! Daddy, it's because I saw... my stalker's car out front. So, I was going to leave through the back. - I'm sorry... - Your stalker, again?! I'm sorry– Come on, let's go. It's already 5:30 P.M. Your mom's waiting in the car. Is she mad? Not really but next time, just come out right away. Boss... is that the girl you've been talking about? Huh? Hey, you can't smoke there! Why? Who's going to stop me? Boss, she's mighty fine! She's mighty fine, really! Do you guys know how Lapu-Lapu beat Magellan? Because... they fought by the ocean. You know what Lapu-Lapu is? A fish! Isn't it? No! Haven't you noticed? It's so hot! So, when Magellan and Lapu-Lapu fought... You guys know why Magellan died? Because of a heat stroke! You're right! It's really hot in here! Im getting roasted out here! Like a roasted pig... and that's the end of Magellan. You guys are crazy. Crazy! The reason why Lapu-Lapu was able to beat Magellan... because he had someone as beautiful as Bulakna on his side. I knew it! Right? Right, bro? Haven't you had your eye on Bulakna for the longest time? Right? Isn't she your girl, Jeff? Isn't she your sweetheart? Right? You jealous? You're really that into her, huh?! I just hope you know what you're getting yourself into. And I hope you can straighten out that tongue of yours! - American Boy. Shouldn't this guy be the "American boy?" Look at her, she's gorgeous, and she's sweet. She's the one, bro. Joy? Marijoy?! Jacqueline. If you only saw them out there, they're really scary. So creepy! Relax... Relax, okay! And it feels like they want to come near to you, you know?! Hurry! Hey, It's Ma'am Cherry! Ma'am Cherry have you seen Jacqueline? I don't know! Where are they? Jacqueline said she was coming here to "The Battle of Mactan." Marijoy! Relax. Calm down, you're just having a panic attack! It was probably nothing. But, Jacqueline! Th- the way they smiled... - It was so perverted. - Listen, listen, listen. It's okay, all right? What's important is the worst they could do is look at you. What you need to think about is mom. We saw auntie Thelma but she seemed to be in a rush. She was looking for Marijoy. She said, she suddenly left her. Marijoy! Oh my... god, Mom! Jacqueline, oh no! I'm screwed! Yeah, okay okay! - Jacqueline! - Okay, okay, don't- Sorry! Mom! Don't worry. I'll be the one to talk to her later. Hey! Were you two with Joy? Auntie, we've also been looking for her. - We were just with her! And she just took off! - Okay, okay I'll look for her. Ma... Marijoy! You were home all along?! - I've been looking for you! - Ma! Ma! Calm down. Don't be mad at Marijoy. She just had a panic attack earlier. Panic attack?! I'm the one who's been panicking looking for her! Ma, she has this admirer who's been following her. and she saw him there at "The Battle of Mactan." Don't be mad at her. Yes mom. There were a lot of them there. A whole group, I thought they were going to come up to me... so you slipped on my mind. Ma, I told her already... she should've ran to you instead. But when I ran into her, she could barely speak that's why I took her home. I'm sorry, Ma. I'm really sorry. That's it?! A panic attack?! You two talk! I'm so tired looking for you! What a mess! What's with all the yelling? Huh?! - Hmm. - Hey... how was "The Battle of Mactan"? Hey, hey! Why are you guys not noticing me? Give me some of those. Here she is! "Sweetheart" is here already! She cheated on me! No! No! - No! No! - She cheated on me! - Poor sweetheart! - No! She's screwing other men behind my back! What do you want us to do with her? That's not true! That's not true! Please, let me go, I will never do it again! I'll give you what you want! I swear. Why do you believe her in the first place?! That's what you get for believing her, bro. Start the festivities! Start it up! Sonny! Sonny! Sonny, help me please! Sonny, please! Help me! You betrayed my friend. That's not true. It was nothing, I was just hung out with my friend! Do you believe her? Do you believe her? It was nothing? Okay... Okay. Jackoff. Jerk. Come on! What's up with you man?! Who's next? What now?! Just buy it! - What? - It's beautiful. Maybe next time? What? Don't be so stingy! You just earned your first pay! - But... - Hey, Jackie! - Is that you? Hi! - Faith... Do you like that? - That just came in. - Really? - Is it for your mom? - Well, yeah. Okay, could I get this in large size? - Sure, let me check in the back. - Okay. Thank you! Just buy it! I want to see it first. - Come on now, it's beautiful already. - Yeah, but I want to buy it for mom. Oh, really? - What "Oh, really?" - Just for her? Lucky her... What? What? What are you talking about? I don't know, just maybe... - What are you talking about? - you'd want to get me something, too? Look at you playing coy. - Fine! Go pick something out for yourself. This girl... - Sis! - Yes? Help me in finding! - What suits me? - All of them... they all suit you. Oh no, this is too big. Me. I am suited for you. Is that him? Yeah. Hey! What are you doing? - Let's leave. - Get out of here! You guys are making a mess! They're disrespecting Faith. Please, trust me, let's go. Faith, we'll go ahead. - We'll just come back later. - Who's prettier between the two of us? Excuse me. Jacqueline was about to tell them off, I just stopped her. Why was she so mad? Because they're stalking you and not her? Maybe the guy has a crush on you. I get insulted when my crush doesn't mind me. Just let it go. It doesn't matter! He's got a bad attitude. What a shame, he's rich and educated but he's a stalker. You know, Jackie is going to have a laugh when she finds out you're still talking about it. - He's behind you! - He's behind you! You're drinking again! You can be such a pain sometimes! You know what? It's gone. I don't feel the same way about you anymore. I really tried. I really did. But, I can't force this. Sonny... I'm sorry. It took me a long time. I took pity on you. I wanted to give you a chance. I'm really, really sorry. Three years? That's a long time. Son of a bitch. Pity? A chance? No. I don't need- I don't need your pity! I don't need you to do me any favors. - Don't pity me! - Sonny! - Don't pity me! Don't give me a chance! - Sonny! What's happening to you?! Don't pity me! Sonny! What are you doing? What's happening to you? You're going to invite her to our home and treat her this way? Go ahead! Try it and I'll have you shot! Pull the trigger. Pull the trigger! Shoot me! Idiot. Remember this, Sonny! No woman is ever going to love you! No one's going to last with that attitude! You devil! You devil! You devil! Sonny boy. They said you called for me at home. Sonny boy! What's on your mind? Just memories. Where are the boys? I didn't invite them. It's just us. It's just us tonight. Sonny boy, I know you. What's bothering you? Who does she think she is? Me? She's gonna ignore me? Snub me? She's just a girl. What a pig. You know what I want to do with her? I want my revenge. I want to see her squealing... begging... while I use her, naked and sobbing. Just like the animal that she is. No, n- Wait, wait. So... she's a pig... and an animal? What's that about? Is it because... She won't give Sonny boy what he wants? "She won't give Sonny what he wants?" Oh, poor Sonny boy. How pitiful. Bastard. Ah, shit. You're being too serious! She's just a girl. What's wrong with you? Relax! There's so many of them out there. Okay? I'll tell you what. Why don't you just show me the girl who's messing with your head. Marijoy! Marijoy! Here, take this barbecue to Debbie, okay? But she's with our brothers. They took her along with them to attract some girls. - What? Those boys. - They're out there looking for girls! We'll take 'em. - Fine. - Yes sir, thank you. - I think there's more them over there. - What were you going to show me? Yeah, sure. Okay. Hey, that's too many. Why? I'm hungry! - Is that so? - Yeah! Hi, Bon! You're up to something. - You know I'm afraid of water! - No! - I'm going back. - No! - No, Ma! - Huh?! It's just shallow! - I'm still afraid! - I promise it's just shallow. Fine, I'll come with you. See? There! - There! - There. - See, let's sit down. What are we even doing here? Look at papa. We'll just wash it off. - Ma... - Yes? look at Marijoy and Bon. You just let them be together the whole day? Well... There's nothing I can do. Especially, if I see you kids happy like that. I wouldn't stop you. I can see Marijoy, she's so happy... like she's so in love with Bon.. and he's so in love with her too. They're always together, right? I guess so. I can see why Sonny's crazy about her. Bro... is that her? Marijoy? Yeah bro, that's her. Where's Sonny? Up there... he couldn't take any more of that. Here... have a drink. Let's go. What about you? Me? I don't know. I can't choose from my suitors. How could you possibly choose when you don't entertain them. They're handsome, kind and smart even! Because, Ma. They can't surpass my true love. True love?! Yeah! You already have a true love? Why haven't you introduced him to us? Who is that? Actually, there's two of them. Two? Jacqueline, are you two-timing them?! Just kidding, come on. Why don't you introduce us? Which one? No, Ma. I'm just kidding. But really, there are two of them... you and Papa. You two are my true love. Oh, my baby. And with that... - why don't you have a swim? - Hey! You better stop! - Dionisio! - Ma! - Don't tell me on dad! - Dionisio, Help me! Your daughter is splashing me! Just go for a swim! Hey, hey, hey! Where's Sonny? Sonny's in a bad mood! Yeah, like he's not sunny! Is that so? Well, luckily... there's two of you and... I have two feet! And so? They're both sore. Let's go! I need a massage! Let's go! Come on! Hey, bro. Keep Sonny occupied first. Bro... I saw that girl, Marijoy. No wonder you turned down those girls I sent you. Sexy body, beautiful face, kissable lips, kissable all over. No wonder you're crazy about her. Sounds like you want first dibs. Well, if you let me then, why not? It's already nightfall, Thelma. It's dark. They say, they often see Jacqueline... standing here, still alive. While Marijoy, running and screaming, bloody. Dionisio, their souls are restless. I know, Thelma. I know. My condolences, Mrs. Chiong. Does Jacqueline still not been found? Attention seeker. You just want sympathy. Yeah, that's all they want. Dennis, don't mind them. Let them be. They're just jealous. Jealous? They're all bastards. But, Dennis. Why are they saying Jacqueline is still alive? That's not true, right? Hey! Dennis. Why are you so upset? Why are you throwing tantrums? Mommy, I think they're bullying him again in school about ate Jackie. How did you know? He tells us about it. We also get bullied about that. They say so much bad things about our family. Dennis... come here. Come here. You tell those kids, okay? Tell them to wait for Marijoy. And she'll show them where Jacqueline is! Anyway, Mommy. They are just a few of them. Everyone else believes us, even my professors. That's what always important. Kids, remember this. Even the Lord has critics. The world is full of non-believers. It's full of evil-doers as well. Like criminals! They have no regard for the law, they don't fear God... in commiting crimes. I'm leaving soon. I'll be living abroad from now on. Maybe... hopefully... I could move on over there. You should... do whatever that can grant you peace. I just wished... this never had happened. Mr. Ruiz, I brought the police here with me. They would like to know, what you saw last night. Don't be afraid to tell the truth, we are here to protect you. It was dark, I heard laughing up there, they were so loud. Like they were drunk or something. Then, I heard screaming. After the screaming, I heard something fall down here. Then, there's somebody else up there screaming, it sounded like she was running away from someone. Then, I heard the engine of the car, and there's loud music. - Just like a band. - That poor girl! What a shame, she was gorgeous. God rest her soul. Hello? Police? Dionisio, when you told me the girls didn't come home, I reported it to the police. That must be why they're calling. Dionisio, What did the police say? Where are our daughters? Okay, thank you. What did they say?! Dionisio, what did the police say? Where are they? They found a dead body... In Tanauan. A girl... - but she's alone. - No. That's not them, those are not my daughters. They're with Bon. That's not one of them. No, no. - They brought her to the morgue. - That's not them, they were together. They'll come home. They'll come back here. Dionisio, they will come back! They'll come back, they're with Bon. No. They'll come back! Auntie... Sorry. I-- I never picked them up that night. They're not with me. - Auntie! Auntie! - Mommy! Mommy! No. - They're with you, right? - I never picked them up that night. No, they're with you, right? Dionisio! Neither of our children are dead. Right? They'll come back here. Dionisio, those are not our daughters! They'll be back! - Bon! Tell me you're with them! - Bruce ta- Bruce take care of your mother. - I have to go. Bro, drive me up there. - Bon, you're with them right? Pa! Pa, where are you going?! Pa, Pa! Help Ma first, Pa! Dionisio! - Ma, calm down. - No! Those are not our daughters! Ma, calm down- Pa! I'm telling you that's not them! - They'll be back here! - Calm down, Ma! They'll be back here! That's not them! I know, I know. They'll be back here, don't worry. We've removed the masking tape and the cuff attached to her wrist. We've also rinsed her off. We'd like for you to identify the body. Come on, let's dance! Marijoy, come on! You have to practice for your debut. Do we really have to? 1, 2, 3... 1, 2. Papa! Boo! Sis! What's wrong with you? You know what? You're too young to be this jumpy! I know you're going to say... that I'm being paranoid again but... I really am being followed. Your admirer? Sis... You know, - I'm going to be late at work. Let's go. - Sis. I'm being serious. You know, he's just an admirer. Beauty queen are always admired, right? It comes with the territory. So, no worries, okay?! What if it's beyond admiration? What if it's something else. What do you mean? The way he looks at me, it's different. Right? Joy. Stop worrying. I won't let anyone near you. Okay? Your sister is here for you. I will care for you. I won't let anyone hurt you... Okay? Come here. Stop worrying. Come on, I'm already late for work. Let's go. Okay. - I'm sorry, sis. - That's okay. Fix your hair. I’m so hungry! They’re here again, with a different girl. Yeah, like the last one looked so scared. I wonder why… Hey! You’re gossiping again. Watch what you’re doing. You’re burning the barbecue! - You guys keep gossiping. - We’re sorry. Sorry. I haven’t eaten all day, man. How much is this stuff? Hi, Sir. The small ones are 10 pesos. The big ones… 20 pesos. You got 20 on you? I’m broke. What?! Broke! What if we don’t have any money? How much will it cost us then? "How is that?" Well, we aren't selling anything to you. Do you even understand? Stubborn jerk! This girl have the guts to talked back at me! Think you’re tough? What if I just take it all? Wait, wait. Let me compute that. Compute what? This is all worthless! You’re being rude! If you aren’t buying anything don’t cause us any trouble! Get out! Trouble?! Me? Looking for trouble? Don’t you know who I am? - No! - What?! Huh?! You’re paying for that! Hurry, hurry! It’s a good thing the rain has stopped already, right? Dad’s going to pick us up, right? You’re all wet. It's just a little. Bro, it’s getting late. They're still not here. If mom finds that out, they’re dead. Come on, Jacqueline said Bon would pick them up. I know but it’s late! Fine. I’ll tell dad, just to remind him. Just come with us! Have they still not found Jacqueline? Where could she be? That’s what they’re trying to figure out... where she is and what happened to her. I’m going to be late. Ma! I’m going! Marijoy! Let’s go! Marijoy went ahead to stop by the church. Is that so? Alright, I'll just see her there. Dennis... Bruce... Play basketball later, study first! Exams are coming up. Ma! I’m going ahead! Jacqueline, is anyone picking you up later? I think Joy mentioned Bon was picking us up. Sis, I made you something! Wow. This is beautiful... let’s finish this later, okay? I look so pretty here. Okay, I’m in a rush, but when I get back, - you, Marijoy and I will go out - You promise? I promise! Goodbye, sis! Okay, I really have to go. Page me later, okay? Yes, Dad. Goodbye! Okay, bye. Our tears won’t bring them back. Crying won't make a difference. Let’s bury Marijoy… and let’s look for Jacqueline. We are going to help Mrs. Chiong. Our congregation needs to help them to attain justice. Hey! What are you doing here? - You're under arrest! - No, no let me go! Ma, let's lay over here. Come on, let's go! No! No! - No, let me go! - Shut up! - Let me go! - Shut up! You, fool! He used drugs earlier! My grandfather is a lawyer! - Let me go! - He does look high! Everybody shut the hell up! No one's getting out! Here we have the alleged perpetrators of the Chiong sisters rape case and the slaying of Marijoy Chiong. These alleged suspects, were taken into police custody, for the crimes they have committed against the Chiong sisters. What do you have to say about all this. We're here to seek justice for the Chiong sisters. - Justice for the Chiong sisters! - They need to be punished for what they did! They're insane! We're here today, to support our- our good friend, Mrs. Chiong! We want justice! They have no shame! Okay. Those are their opinions... on the matter at hand. Wait, what about you officer? Anything you would like to add? No comment, no comment. And that is all we have right now about the case. Reporting live, back to you guys. Hey, hey, hey. I don't want to see any of you around here for a while. A lot of names are getting thrown around, persons of interests. Hey, bro. What's up, what's up? Like I was saying. Many different names are now of interests to the cops. We're lucky our names haven't come up yet. So, let's keep a low profile for the time being. Copy that, boss. Boss, I've heard always the name of our group. What's the matter? You're getting nervous? Are you nervous? - Jeff, I was just saying. Jeff... - Relax, bro. Bro, bro. Jeff, put that away. You guys see this? I'm going to empty this... on whoever opens their mouth... and I'll start with you. No, Jeff. I won't, I won't. Even you. If you rat out on us for being too drunk... I'll shoot all these bullets into your face. Magnum. 1890. It's been killing since the Spanish era. It has also brought down many Japanese men. But the most this baby here has killed are... Filipinos. Come on guys, break them up! We're all going down if they start shooting! - Do it! - Guys, let's just drink this off. Woah... what's your problem? Fool, you crazy? Why are running away? Don't worry about him. He's one of mine. I'll take care of him. How about I take care of him, right now? - I said I'll take care of him. He's my cargo. - He's going to snitch on us! Sonny boy... - Woah, hey! - There we go! Wow! Where'd you even get this? Worthless! He's got something better! High grade! Sonny, let them know where you're getting that. Tell them where! So, they'll know! Now, you know why I don't just want to drop him. Let's go! Let's get out of here. - Peace out! - Bounce! Bounce! - Let's go! - We'll go ahead, boss. And, you... You mess up one more time... Jeff's going to dispose of you. So, better shut up! Boss, I was just saying. I've been hearing his name comes up always. If your nerves are getting into you. Go home... lie low, hide and don't resurface for a while. I don't give a damn, go ahead. Put yourself together. Sir, if you have any information please... give us a call. Sir, please give us a call if you see her-- Sh- She's my daughter. Sir, we’d like to ask for your help. Thank you. Sir, if it’s okay with you please help us find my sister. Please, if you might have any information regarding this missing person please give us a call. Here, take this one too. Father, good afternoon. We’d like to ask if you could hold a mass for my two sisters. Where’s your mother, child? There she is, father. Dionisio… Take your family and go home. You need to rest. The day will come... that they'll face justice and serve time in jail... and will finally lead us to Jacqueline. My child, ask the Lord to lead me in the right direction... So, I can find your sister. Thelma, our kids knew that we're going to reunite in here. Together. When you get home they’re already asleep... and they’re still asleep when you leave. Nobody can take care of them if I always go with you. You take care of our child first. Our home will never be at peace... ‘til those men are free for their sins. and not until Jacqueline is found. I understand that. I only wish you give our kids at home some peace of mind. Where’s the other one? I don’t know, he wanted to stay out there. Please let us go. Stop this… Have mercy! Jacqueline, help me! Scream! Louder! Marijoy! Please don’t take her! - Let me come! - Me first! Stay there! Start with the other one. Sharing is caring! Help me! Announcement! Me first! Now, you have nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you’re mine now. All mine! Scream! Jacqueline! I said scream! Come on, scream! What are you doing out here? Nothing, just getting some air. You okay? Yeah, I’m good, I’m good. We just finished in there! Damn, bro! It was good! Why don’t you have a go? What?! What are you waiting for? No, I’m good for now. Why don’t you have another? Go! Hey! Boss Sonny’s been looking for you. Good, right?! Totally. That was wild. I didn’t think we were actually going through with it. I’ve been waiting for this. Yeah, the older one’s a fighter, huh? Marijoy’s so tempting though. - She belongs to boss though. - Wait, wait up. Boss said cuff ‘em together. But…why? Wait, are these real? Where is this night going? I don’t know but I’m guessing you do, huh? I don’t think we still need the keys to these, huh? Boss, might need me in there. Really though, where is this night going? Sonny boy, what do we do next? I kind of want a piece of Marijoy. It’d be a shame to let her go to waste. I don’t care. Just stick to the plan. Dispose of them. Not yet. Not before I get a taste of Marijoy. I want to taste the girl that drove you mad. Bastard. I’ll shoot you where you stand. I’ll shoot you… - What’s next, Boss? - What do we do? Separate those two. You heard him, separate them! Leave that one with me. - There you go! - That’s what’s up! He’s going for it! Hurry! Get down all of you! Get out! Take that one over there! Jacqueline! Jacqueline! Hi! Make her dance. Dance, dance! Go ahead! Jacqueline! Jacqueline! Come on, dance already! I said, dance! Dance! Jacqueline! Papa… Papa! I won’t say it again, dance! I think boss is done over there. Is it our turn with her? Is she any good? She’s delicious! Delicious! You guys go! Hey, remember to share! Thanks, boss! How you holding up? Marijoy! That when a person dies... the last thing they see will be the ones left in their eyes. My question is... if you yourself, believe that saying? Stop. - Please sto-- - Close your eyes! You guys take care of this. Why?! You want to leave, right? - She wants to leave. - Yes, please, let me go home. I will let you leave. She said she wants to go home, boss! Let me leave. I want to go home to my Mama. Yeah, sure, leave just leave… I want to go home to my Mama. Now, you can leave… this world! Marijoy! Marijoy! Woah! Marijoy! Marijoy! You animals! You’re all animals! You’re monsters! Monsters! Shut up! Auntie, these are the questers from our school. We are also students from Marijoy's school. We’d like to offer our help in finding Jacqueline. These are our God-given gifts, through the power of prayer and song... we might be able to lead a lost soul into the light. Don’t worry, Ma’am Thelma. We’re here to help. My song will illuminate her soul. Auntie... let them do their thing... they will lead her soul into the light. Jacqueline is starting to communicate. Come to the light, Jacqueline. Auntie, maybe the reason why her soul isn’t responding is... Is-- is because she isn’t dead… maybe she’s alive? Or… maybe her spirit is restless. Maybe that’s why they see apparitions of her in those places? Hey! She’s trying to escape! Get her! Jeff! Chase after her! The kids no longer want to come with me, Thelma. They think... I’m just going to take them home. I want us all to be together again, Thelma. I want our family to be whole again. Eat together, pray together, sleep and wake up together. There they are. I'm already tired of sadness. Dionisio, look for a new home for us. Thank you, Thelma. Thank you. Come on in, kids Your mom prepared something very special for us for our first day at this new house. Thelma! The kids are here! Hi, ma! That sure looks good, ma! Ma… Come on, enough, let’s sit back down. Oh, you. But seriously, ma. I really don’t think I’ll ever have a boyfriend… because I really can’t trade you and dad in for anybody. I really can’t. So, I always pray that you and dad never grow old. That we’d still do all the things we did when I was a child. Like kiss you before bed, give you hugs with baby kisses to wake you up. Just like that. My child. I want that, too. But, nothing lasts forever. Sometimes, people leave. Sometimes they go to heaven. Like I always say, in this world... things come and go. Well, Ma. I can’t accept that. I just want us to be together forever… and I know God will listen to my prayers and he will grant my request. You… No, ma. I’m being serious. If you ever had to go… I’d rather He take me first… because I can’t face losing you. Okay, enough. Let’s not talk about those things. I love you. I love you, ma. Hello? Do you want to see your child, Mr. Chiong? What do you mean? Who is this? It isn’t important who I am. I know where Jacqueline is. Where?! Where do I meet you? Come when the sun already sets. I’ll tell you where to meet us. Okay! Okay! Thelma! Thelma! Is that him? I think so. Where’s Jacqueline? Oh, is that how it’s supposed to go down? We took care of your child, fed her, nursed her back to health… Mr. Chiong, there’s still a lot left to talk about. The things we had to go through just to take her in. We’ve put a lot of effort into caring for Jacqueline, Mr. Chiong. We’ve spent a lot on her, Sir. In fact, there are debts we have to pay off, Mr. Chiong. I’ll give you however much you need. Just lead us to Jacqueline! You’re being a little too hasty, Mr. Chiong. How about you give us a few thousands right now... and, we’ll bring Jacqueline to you. Does that mean you’re coming in with some money, Auntie Gigi? You can gamble again? Remember to give me my share when you win! How’s about you ask my wife for your money?! If you’re telling the truth, take us to Jacqueline now. Because if you’re lying you better get into your car right now... and leave! Before we call the cops on you! You even have the guts to use a child. Scammers! You were right about them, Thelma. They were just looking for a quick pay out. There are many more of them out there, Dionisio. Just waiting to take advantage of our situation. Ma... Jacqueline? Jacqueline! Jacqueline, my child! Jacqueline! Jacqueline! Jacqueline! Jacqueline! - Ma! - Jacqueline! Jacqueline! Ma! Ma! Jacqueline-- Where’s Jacqueline? Father, where’s Jacqueline? She was just here. Thelma, you really need to rest. Boss… All hearsay, no direct testimonies. We still don’t have a lead that the suspects we’ve apprehended have anything to do with the crime. Sir, what if one of the accused... is willing to come forward as a state witness? It seems valid sir, the one he's saying. Well, we still need to evaluate his statement but that could be potentially be concrete evidence. Whatever they're saying isn't true! Let me go! Let me go! Enough! Let's go! My poor child! I can't take this anymore! I will testify for the Chiong sisters! - Attorney, help my child! - Turn my client into state witness! He's ready to testify! Before I take his side... How about he testify first in court-- - I'd believe him then! - Yes! We will do so! - Jail them all! - Monsters! - Justice for Chiong! - Jail those monsters! My son is innocent! Mrs. Chiong, I'm really sorry to say... It's driving me crazy, I can't take this case anymore. I'm very sorry, I really am. I'm sorry, Mrs. Chiong. I can't take this anymore. I quit. Mrs. Chiong, I'm sorry. I cannot do this. I gotta go. Mrs. Chiong, I’m saddened to say, I have to drop out of this case as one of your lawyers. I just have too much on my plate. I no longer have time for my family. So, I just wanted to let you know… That I-- That you won’t be able to make it to the next hearing? Is that what you wanted to say? You’re scared. That’s the only explanation. I know you, you can’t be bribed. You have a clean record… But, you’re afraid. That’s the only reason you want to step down. Ma’am, I hope you understand. Of course, I understand. Hello, Mrs. Chiong. I’m back on the case. Wait, don’t come any closer! What do you think you’re doing? Don’t you know who I am? Bro, let’s get him. Yeah, let’s go! Don’t come any closer! I’ll blind her! I’ll blind her! You think I’m joking? No! Please! Where do you think you’re going?! Promulgate the decision. Wherefore, in light of the forgoing considerations, all accused are hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt and thereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of double life imprisonment. So ordered. We’re all law students, any miscarriage of justice should concern us all. I truly think that some of the accused were innocent. You’re right, I wasn’t fully convinced. You are both conclusive! Which is wrong! I’m convinced they’re at fault. I have faith in our justice system, they don’t convict innocent people. Yeah, bud. My sentiments exactly. I agree with that, bro. Maybe one of them is innocent, let’s just trust the justice system. Specially the sad plight of the mother. I wouldn’t want my mom to go through that. Imagine waging a one woman’s battle?! My child, your ordeal has begun to attain justice… though we still have a long way to go in finding Jacqueline. I hope we find her soon or she finds her way home. Get her! Let’s go! Jacqueline was seen running through here, it seemed like she was out of her mind. Even now, I still pity them. We saw a girl who looked an awful lot like Jacqueline, get taken by the seaside, they feasted on her ‘til the morning. And when nightfall came they spoke to a boatman even offered him some booze. They bound her hands and feet and at the end of the rope was a large rock. She was already too weak to scream… Does that mean they dumped her into the ocean? You should’ve said something so they could have been apprehended right then and there. No way! We didn’t want to get involved. We didn’t hear or see anything! What’s she doing here? I came by for Marijoy... I came to beg for justice. I repeat, my son is a good man. If you raised your children well, so did I. My son is innocent. If you're seeking for justice, then seek for true justice. My son shouldn’t be imprisoned! We both weren’t here when it happened. We’re both hoping for a fair judgement. I hope the truth comes out. According to the witness, this is where Marijoy was killed and where Jacqueline was taken away. You're fortunate, Even if your son is behind bars, You are able to hug him, kiss him, and talk to him. As for me... all I can do is cry and wait. Wait for them to come back even though that day may never come Maybe I can see them in my dreams, be able to kiss them, hug them… I’m waiting, still waiting, for Jacqueline. Heavenly Father, I am so exhausted. Grant me and my family a measure of peace by leading me to her. Please lead Jacqueline back to us... Lord, have mercy. Thelma, my child, what else are you asking of you? I have granted you justice... And, I have given you back the daughter you are seeking. Pray to your sisters, pray that they guide your mom back home to us. I’m sure, dad. God is good. He’ll bring back mom back to us. He won’t disappoint you even Jacqueline. She’ll find her way home. Just have faith. Thelma, to this day, you have not found peace. One of my frustrations is, as I search and wait for Jacqueline… I can’t help but seek and wait for you as well. I want you to be your old self, the woman I married, the mother of Bruce, Dennis and Debbie. I also want her to find her way back home. You’ve been leading the fight for the Violence Against Crime for years, yet I still don’t see that you’re content. Or any closer to being the mother you once were to our other children. Why don’t we get away from all this? Give yourself another chance, just the two of us anywhere you want to go. Our two sons are gone, too. They have families of their own. Debbie’s the only one left with us and we hardly give her the time of day anymore. We have to go back to our old selves... And, finally bring peace into our home. Jacqueline? My child? Mommy, you’re dreaming again. I’m sorry to wake you up. It’s just Dennis called and he’s asking me to stay over for a couple of days. He says they miss the cake I usually make. Debbie, I told you not to wake up your mother. You didn’t listen to me. Dad, I didn’t want to leave without saying goodbye. I told you, I’d be the one to tell her that Dennis wants you to go there. You’re right, dad. Because even if I’m gone for two days, she wouldn’t even notice. Your daughter and I spoke last night while you were sleeping. Apparently we’re both missing the old you. I felt better knowing I wasn’t alone. But isn’t it true? She’s often absent from home. When you leave, I’m still asleep. When you’re here, you’re too tired to pay any attention to us. Usually when I kiss you, you’re too exhausted to notice. She’s close to getting upset with you. She says, before you used to pay so much attention to her... unlike these days. She thinks maybe it’s ‘cause she isn’t pretty anymore. Dad! I didn’t say anything like that! I know I’m beautiful! People even say, “you look like Jacqueline!” …and I have given you back the daughter you are seeking. She’s in your home, Thelma. You may hold her in your arms once more. God loves you. Ma! Ma! My child. Thank you, Jacqueline. Thank you. Ma, you’re mistaken. I’m not Jacqueline but... I guess that’s okay, just so you could hug me again. It’s okay, I love you, mom. You never have to seek me out, I’ll be the one always waiting for you. END
