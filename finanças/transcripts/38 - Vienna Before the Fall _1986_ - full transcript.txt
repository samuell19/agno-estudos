One moment Mr. Pschihoda. Pekarek! Let him wait in the striped room, Pekarek. Give him a flimsy excuse. And lock the door to the blue room. Lock the door, Pekarek. Get a move on. - Oh, I see. - There you are. - Nothing but troubles... - Me too. - Cognac? What? - Troubles. Caused by Miss Hell? - Mr. Sovary. Not because of Miss Hell. Quite the contrary. So... No money? Write me a play for the Josefstadt Theater. An entertaining one. Intelligent, funny, alive. Include a role for Miss Hell. Done. He waits in the striped room. The dramaturge from the Burgtheater is also here. He's waiting in the blue room. Because you're "on the phone". - Oh really? - No, not really. What an old bag! Go tell him how smart he is. He will be a lot more easy to handle afterwards. And Pekarek: Get me Paris on the phone. The "Comedie". I'm serious. Did you hear what I just said? - I did. She's a treasure. Mrs. Pekarek. Do you know how she's called by Mr. Farkas? The "Grey corpulence". Ah the two of us... Mrs. Pekarek and me. She's from Prague. I am from Budapest. Combined here in Vienna. A Jewish foundation. For me this is the true Austrian Identity. - What is it again? - The "Comedie". Hello. This is Vienna. Mr. Sovary. One moment. I connect you to Mr. Giraudoux. Yes, I wait. Mr. Giraudoux. Now that's an author. Wrote a play about the Trojan War. He's political and funny. And smart. He's sure that there will be a war. No no no. If I want it just for once. And I want it just for once. I want it, and if I want it has to be. Come, now! Oh these men. Or should I put that down? - No let him. I have to write that down. Good, right? Let's continue. Oh these men! You are not used to it. What are you thinking? I would like to run to the end of the world. - Always the same old story. - You would like to play his part, right? Good roles are always played by Jews at this theater. So you found something to blame him for. - Why? - That's not true. He is Jewish, but she isn't. Miss Hell really is a good actress. Thank you. Good bye. - I'm funny too. - What? - Like that Giraudoux. - Really? Show me! Let's start, 3 acts Opening Night at Christmas, Josefstadt Theater. 20 shows guaranteed. - How do we call it? - "Sun Over the Horizon". So what's Miss Hell's role then? The horizon? - A car driver. - A car driver, that's a good idea. I mean, who owns a car these days? The poorer the people are, the more they want to see... what the few people do, that still are doing well. That is called substitute satisfaction. Set at the Riviera. Great. Nice girls in bathing suits. Wet hair. Long legs. Her car breaks down. Aha. And all of a sudden there comes the millionaire with his wrench. I thought more of a... - Hoffmann you will do the right thing! But be careful Hoffman, be careful. It has to be funny. Funny. That's my condition. We don't want to have a bad time. We already know, that times are bad. And if you can't help it, to tell how things are these days... then do it disguised, ok? Don't be direct. Between the lines. Hoffmann. Sneak your message in. Alright? Great. So you want Miss Hell to play that role? Pekarek! Pekarek! Yes. Call Mr. Gebhart to send a basket of roses to Miss Hell. In times like these it's all about surviving with dignity. Only if there's no more chance at all... but then... quickly. As painless as possible. Well maybe we will be spared. Alright? Delivery at the end of October. Advance money at Mrs. Pekarek. Make sure, Miss Hell has some nice outfits. A nice long dress. Fur. The audience likes that. Say hello to her. Adios. Good bye. - Good bye. Were you kidding me? - What do you mean? About the roses for Miss Hell? - I wasn't... I mean... I was. That's going to be a great play. So maybe still. A bouquet will do it. No basket. Send it right away to the Josefstadt. Without a letter. What are you waiting for? Go go go. Send Mr. Pschihoda in. - Pschistrazil. Wait, no. The dramaturge first. Authors can wait. So everything stays the same. - I hope so! But then you have to make that stop. People can't send me roses? Sure they can. It's nice from Mr. Hoffmann. But not to the rehearsal. Be honest, would you also be angry, if I got flowers from somebody else but him? Stop that. - From Erwin? You wouldn't allow other people to treat you like this. What do you mean? You can't have it all. If you want to live a life apart from your art... you have to split yourself up. Have a nice day. - I need to go to Berlin for 3 weeks. Even if we have to stop our rehearsals. So you want to become clear about how much you will miss him? Amongst other things. I'm going to sell it. The Puch motorcycle? - Yes, the Puch. And with the advance... - Martin, I don't need an apartment right now. We can't miss that opportunity. It's perfect. Mozart passed that place three times a day. Really. I can tell you more after I've been to Berlin. You're so unsettled... - And you are thoughtless. Do you want me to think about you during rehearsal? Why? Not really. If you do so, you might one day think about rehearsal while making love. You never gave me a present, that reminds me of you. That elephant, yes. But no flowers to the rehearsal. Deal? - Deal. I don't want to settle down. I wanna go to Berlin. I just feel overwhelmed. - You give in too easily. What gives me security? Our nights together? - Why not? Martin, the fact that you supposedly are different from what I am... That's what your mother says. - Leave my mother alone. Cut it out. I don't care about politics. But politics should not one day tell you what to do. Tell your mother that I am not a Jew. I was baptized at 2 weeks old. I know my little Christ. You forever displaced nomads. You always want to settle down. I'm just scared. So, no apartment then? - I don't know. Not at this moment. So... You think that I take possession of you because I'm looking for an apartment for us? I love you. Sometimes I think this rarely shows. Did I say just one word... When you said: I'm going to Berlin for 3 weeks. I said nothing. Not a single word. Even if it's as plain as the nose on your face... what awaits you there. - Martin! This is our first fight. And there are more to come. But no flowers. - No flowers. These aren't from me anyway. What? They are not from you? No, Sovary sent them, The publisher, that idiot. To me this guy is right at the bottom. A real gentlemen, Robert Sovary. What's wrong Cari? The roses are not from you! - So what? Exactly 3 minutes ago you were grumbling about the roses and now? You don't understand. I am just sad. Probably because I'm leaving. But at the same time I'm happy. Where are you heading? - To Mr. Drechsler. Third floor on the left. Welcome, Mr. Hoffmann. Mr. Drechsler is in the case room. You can wait in his office. He will be there any minute. - Thank you. Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Hoffmann. Martin. How did you come inside? Did Mr. Dembitzki... - Welcome me inside? Yes. That is not a crime. I will be in trouble if the old man shows up in here. Don't do that again, ok? Cigarette? How are things? Are you working or is it all about Miss Hell? I am working on a play. And it is all about Miss Hell. No, it is not all about her. This relationship is a ticking time bomb my friend. You seem to enjoy that fact. But I will tell you how things are. I know a bit more than you do. For Hitler Austria's annexation is just a matter of weeks. How do you know? - We have our sources. Trust me. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I think day in day out about how to escape this situation, and you are just sitting there and say: It is all about Miss Hell. - For me it is. No it's not. Especially for you. Did you make plans yet? What are you talking about? - Leaving. Leaving? - Yes. I am looking for an apartment. - In New York? I even found one. In the Webergasse. Martin, come on. Wake up. Please wake up. You can't stay in a country with such a Racial Disgrace. You are crazy. 2 years ago you were fighting in Spain. You were dedicated. And now, when fascism arrives here or already has arrived, you just keep your eyes closed. Try to get a visa. Now! As long as Miss Hell is in Berlin, you can handle things. By the way, the B.Z. published an interview by her, she never gave. Can you get me that issue? I am begging you. Please. You are just as endangered as I am. I am Aryan. And I am prepared already. What? - Yes! There is a real mess going on. Good evening, Mr. Hoffmann. Come to the case room. The prosecutor just gave an order there is an confiscation threat... We can't write anything about the fact, that things are not right between Vienna and Berlin. Censorship. It's messed up. I tried to smuggle in a few lines into the newspaper. Inconspicuously. Spread on many pages. Every time the same. We can't publish anything. So? We fall for them again. Bye, Hoffmann. When you're back at the caf?... I will get you the B.Z.. Thank you. - And read the newspaper from Basel. There you find all the information we can't print. Martin. Get your head straight, ok? I'm sorry, the dining room is closed. Until 6. Ah. Miss Hell. Great to see you in Berlin again. It's been a while... 2 years, 3? - Almost 3. 3 years. Time flies. 10 more minutes, Miss Hell. Until we open up. I will turn on the lights for you. Do you want the soup, as usual? - As usual. Thank you, Mr. Hager. Soup is called Kraftbr?he nowadays. No more foreign expressions. Kraftbr?he. But by the same German cattle. So, 10 minutes as I said before, Miss Hell. - Alright. Excuse me Miss Hell, do you remember me? Two days ago, the train from Vienna. You left that book behind. I read in the B.Z. you were staying here. Oh how nice of you. Thank you. You could not buy this book here in Berlin. It's better like this. - Oh thank you. I love Joseph Roth. I don't know his books, but he is Jewish, isn't he? Do you want to keep it? Radetzkymarsch. About the downfall of the old Austria. I can buy another copy in Vienna. I don't know. Thank you. Yes please. That was very kind of you. - I also wanted to talk to you. Just a few words. I could not talk to you that night in the train. Are you heading to the theater? - Yes, the daily rehearsals. Emilia Galotti. You already played her in Salzburg. I read it in the B.Z.. This summer. Max Reinhardt was the director. That fact wasn't mentioned in the B.Z., but I even told them. They can't write that. - Why? Max Reinhardt is a Jew. But he was Berlins biggest theater personality for decades. And that he directed me to play Galotti is a fact. They didn't mention that at all? No. - That's sad. Are you a musician? You had a violin with you in the train, right? I am not a musician. Madeleine Von Wartenburg. My husband owns a factory. Do you like being in Berlin? - I love this city. The audience is so enthusiastic. I'm not used to that in Vienna. You are like a star from another world. So I can shine a bit. Hopefully. A real treasure. A poster girl. I saw you playing Iphig?nia and... - And? I was not expecting, that... - What? You would come back. - Why not? You were so clear-minded on stage. Your Iphig?nia knew exactly what was right and wrong. I don't like talking about politics. You should have played another role this year. Than Galotti? I am not an expert, but this play shows, how people... Excuse my talking. There can't be a play like this. - Why not? Because what should be shown instead was never there before as well. What was never there before? That you can't write down facts for instance, is one thing. But from killing words to killing people is just a small step. Do you want to order? No, thanks. - My soup. Just a moment. You really mean that, killing people? - You have no idea. If I was Jewish... - It would be bad. I knew what I had to do. - What? To do everything possible to get my husband and children out of here. Or else to separate myself from everything. I would like to be a Jew. - But you can leave if you want. The children are in school and the factory does well, since the competitors are all gone. Leaving, because we don't want to see injustice happening... My husband doesn't care about politics. I love him. People can tolerate the most astounding things. But who will be helped, if I don't play Galotti in Berlin? I don't know. What helps. Ma'am. German Rinderbr?he. Very hot. Are you coming to the premiere? I will. - Next Thursday. Please. There will be 2 tickets for you. Promised? - It's a pleasure. Good bye. - Good bye. My pleasure, Mr. Hoffmann. Like usual? The corner table is vacant. My pleasure, Alois. Like usual. I'll take the corner. I will hand you the newspapers in a moment, Mr. Hoffmann. Dr. Sperling is reading the one from Prague. One moment, I will handle that. Make a call for Dr. Sperling, will you? What about the Basler? That got confiscated an hour ago. Here's the second copy. Please read it without attracting any attention. Dr. Sperling please. - What is it? - Telephone. Here you are Mr. Hoffmann. The newspaper from Prague from Dr. Sperling. Your coffee will be right there. - Thank you Mr. Alois. I am waiting for a phone call. - From Berlin? Mr. Alois. I can't hide anything from you. FINIS AUSTRIAE The end of Austria I'm coming. Could you arrange a call to Vienna. Vienna 13-5-35. Caf? Herrenhof. I will be here in the hall or at the party. Thank you. There she is. Miss Hell. Wonderful. - Fabulous. Are you looking for something, Miss Hell? Can I help you? No thank you. I am alright. - Great. Then may I perhaps ask you to come sit with us? Please. Do us this little favor. The star of the night. We are really fortunate. We were talking about you the whole time. - You were fabulous tonight. Cigarette? May I? Such a great actress, who rarely appears on German stages... I only play on German stages. - The gentlemen from the Reichskulturkammer think, that it's a pity if a German artist more or less constantly acts abroad. In a country, that is an enemy. - But we are all glad you are here now. Me too. It is a great theater. Every German theater should be a great theater. If you'd stay longer, you would know why. I have a contract in Vienna. - Contracts can be cancelled. You could play every role you want here. - You should not let things get in your way. What do you mean? See, your private situation... - It's about you, Miss Hell. About you and your career. You used a very nice term, gentlemen. Private situation. You mean Martin Hoffmann. Am I right? This is something personal. I don't want to talk about this. Ok? Thank you for your company. You don't have to worry about my career. And if I really can play every role, that I want here in Berlin... - Sure you can. - Then I have a suggestion. The play should be a German Classic though. - It is. It is. - So? Which one? "Nathan, der Weise. " The wise Jew. Avenger of his daughter. A wonderful role. See you then. - Caf? Herrenhof. - 13-5-35? - Yes, yes! Hotel Akron, Berlin. Mr. Hoffmann please. - Speaking. Carola! - Hello Martin. Finally. How was it? - What about the apartment? - What? - Don't you want it? - No, you! - You! Me, why? You said, you don't want it. - So do you have it or not? - Yes, I took it. And when you come back, there will be a bed at least. I swear. Do you believe it? - I miss you. - What did you say? - I miss you. - Oh, you miss me. - Yes. - I miss you too. Now tell me. How was it? How it was? I was great. At least I think so. I think, I was good. The audience liked it. Or pretended to like it at least. Dr. Zimmermann sends his regards. He said, that he knows you. - Me? - Yes. A big man with glasses. - Oh yes, from the embassy. - The one from the embassy. - I like him. Madeleine was there, too. - Who? From the train. I will tell you about her. - Madeleine? - Martin, I love you. - How is the opening night celebration? - The celebration? Just awful. - I want to know... - I was so angry just now. Imagine, There were these jerks in uniform... - I want to know, how the celebration was. What? What? What do you want to know? - Are you alright? Yes. But those idiots from the Ministry wanted me to stay here in Berlin. - Hello! Hello? - Hello. - Hello Cari. - Hello. Are you still there? Yes Cari. I'm still here. How is the weather in Berlin? Is there snow? - Why do you want to know? - Just because. Cari, please call me tomorrow. On this number. Where? - In the Herrenhof Caf?. Between 12 and 1. Between 12 and 1. Yes. My phone is about to die. - I just won't listen to these idiots... - Cari please, be careful! - Be aware. - Why? - Make sure you call me. - Be aware? Yes, be aware! But please... between 12 and 1. The call will be over soon. Take good care of yourself. Thanks a lot for coming. I'm taking Mrs. Schostal. I'm sorry, I didn't expect so many people to come. Bye. - Mrs. Schostal. - Yes. - Do we have a deal? - Yes. - Great. - Thank you. - Do you have a minute? - Sure. - Thank you. Hello Martin? - Who is this? - Carola Hell. This is the receptionist. Two men just walked up to your room. Two men? Are you out of your mind? They should go home. Who are they? I think, they are from the police. - What? - Gestapo. - What? Why does she deal with people like that? - Who? What? Carola Hell, the actress. To be with a Jew. - Do you know her? - No. - And him? - No. He gave me a tip. - A big one? - Quite. Because he wanted to impress you. That's how Jews are. - Beautiful piece. - How many Jews have you been dealing with? - I try not to. - Come on and help, Karli. The "Hauswart" is right, mom. - The who? You don't call him janitor anymore. - So? When did this happen? It can't go on like that. Who are we? Treated like garbage. This has to change. - Whoever is not with us, is against us. - Shut your mouth, Karli. Do you think you are a big shot, now your dad is in prison? He will be there for a long time. Good afternoon. I have to leave. - You know everything, right? - Yes. - Here is the key. I have a second one. - This is the janitor. - We already met. - "Hauswart", if I may. - Good Afternoon. - Kemetter. - Mr. Kemetter. So, until the 1st of December. - Yes. Mrs. Hell will be back then. 9 o'clock. - 9 o'clock. Fine. Good bye. My pleasure, Mr. Hoffmann. Hello? - Tagblatt, editorial office. - Mr. Drechsler, please. Is he back from lunch yet? - One moment. - Thank you. Drechlser. - Toni. - Yes. She hasn't called yet and it is already after 1. Could you maybe call the embassy and ask for Dr. Peter Zimmermann... - Just come to my office, will you? - Thank you, I will come. I'm just waiting 10 more minutes. So long, Toni. - Bye. - Thank you. STARVING CHILDREN DESERVE TO EAT Let's take the tram, mom. - We have no money. - But you got ten Schilling. - Yes. We will buy coal with that. It's not my fault that we don't have any money. The tram conductor should just punish the ones responsible for the situation. - So who is responsible then? - The Jews. They don't know anything about Mrs. Hell at the embassy. Your friend Zimmermann already left. He has no phone at home. Also in the theater they have no clue. It got them really nervous. But if something happened, they would have told the theater. There is a show tonight. They are trying their best to... They will call us back here. They! They try! Me! I have to do something! - Martin please... - I can't stand sitting here waiting. For sure Cari is upset about the situation as well as I am. What do you want to do? You can't do anything. Do you want to go to Berlin? That would be the biggest favor you could do them. You just have to wait. I won't let you beg. What are we supposed to do until you start your new job? - You won't starve to death. I'll figure something out. There is always some laundry I can do. There are poor and there are rich people. - The Reds would have changed that. - The Socialists? Your father always used to say: Everyone is supposed to clean up after himself. - If we just stayed in power... - But you just didn't stay in power. We would have made it there. You don't think so, right? Come on mom. Dad sits in prison. His slogans are worthless. ANNEXATION OF AUSTRIA UNSTOPPABLE Nobody knows anything. I need to go to Berlin. Don't worry. Train leaves at 1:30. Tagblatt Prague. - Yes. Winternitz. I connect you. - Tagblatt Vienna here. Mr. Winternitz. A call for you. Vienna. - Yes. So early today. I don't know why so early today. There he is. Hello Mr. Hoffmann. - Hello Mr. Hoffmann. Winternitz. Mr. Plohn, are you here because of me? I travel privately, how do you know? - Mr. Drechsler called. - I should have known. - So you probably know what we want. - What we should tell you on his behalf. - That I should not go to Berlin. - Right. - Yes, correct. - What? Stop. Hold it. - Mr. Drechsler wants you to know, that everything is fine. Cut your stupidities. Stay in Prague for a while. If you want we can go for a drink. I see. That is very kind Mr. Winternitz. But I'm afraid... Alright. You're tired. Go to sleep then. No, no, no. I'm really not interested in private affairs, but when a writer like you is going to give himself to the Gestapo like that.. That's insane. That's very kind Mr. Plohn. But I'm not going to Berlin as a writer. I'm going there private. You know that. I know that. But does their dog know that? Alright then. Good bye. Carola. I will call the Tagblatt when I'm at the embassy. That is faster. Mr... what's his name? - Drechsler. Poor Martin. - Just tell him what happened. A faux pas. A mistake. You should not dramatize everything. It was misfortunate. What if everyone would dramatize a situation like that? - A tragic mistake. - I know. Diplomates. We Austrians. I tell you what it was: It was just a disgrace. Thank you Peter. Now if you don't mind. - Good bye. If a Jew acts the fool, he really does well. - Toni, he is insane. - I know. - You have to take care of it. - I will. What are we supposed to do, Toni? - Carola... Please do the best you can. - Yes. - I love him. - How was the interrogation? Interrogation? I was arrested. - I have to go to the theater. - I'll take care of him. - Please let me know. - Alright. - Everything. - Tank you Toni. You are... - An angel. I know. Good bye. Yes. Good bye. Good evening. - Good evening. - Custom control. Thank you. Where are you going? - To Germany. I have to. Oh, you have to. So why do you have to go? - I have my reasons. - What reasons? - That's not your business. - Maybe it is. Come with us. We will see after the inspection. Body search. And let me see your bags. Foreign exchange control. I don't have any money on me. 100 Schilling. Get undressed. You can get dressed now. This is for you. Martin Hoffmann. Nighttrain Vienna - Berlin. Podmokly station. Had to do it. Don't be mad. Stop. I swear everything is ok with Mrs. Hell. Stop. I talked to her. Stop. See you tomorrow afternoon. Toni. Happy New Year Mr. Kemetter. - Good evening Mrs. Schostal. - Good evening. I hate playing 2 shows on new years eve. Depends on the play. I can't act on stage and be with you at the same time. Too bad. Remember calling the taxi on time. - So you make it back until midnight. - Bye. Otherwise I will make a move on your mother. - Happy New Year Mrs. Schostal. - Likewise. What's the matter? Please ask her. I'm already late. What's the matter Mrs. Schostal? What happened? Your husband? He is supposed to be home soon. They are saying there will be an amnesia. - Great. - He won't find work anyway. I found that on my son Karli. You don't know my husband. If he comes back home and finds that... An old socialist. Mr. Hoffmann. He will kill my son. - Where should I put the chair? - Right here. It's a thimble. Or a baby? - A helmet. Or a ship. - No, no. A helmet. Ancient Rome. - Something military. - Your mother said it's a baby. - Mother... What do you have? I don't know. Always the same. Weapons. Guns. Spears. Bombs. - Your baby looks like a grenade to me. - You are a pessimist. Compared to you I am. The generals are fighting back against Hitler. - So you support our officers? - Not me. I don't support anybody. Toni. 7 minutes to 12. No more defeatist statements this year. I am no politician. But I think that a few civilians can't line up against Hitler. - We would have to build an alliance. - With who? With the Czechs. Hungarians. Yugoslavs. Uncle Sandor's favorite topic. Re-establishment of the Monarchy. - Carola, where is the champagne? - There it is. - The radio. May I? - Sure! Toni, are you coming? I think that is really odd. The only Jew lightens the Christmas Tree. The candles, I hope. 30 seconds. Almost there. Alright. Exactly now! Cheers. - Cheers. - 38! - Wait. - Yes. Toni. I want to thank you for what you did to help us. - Toni. - Carola. To '38. - Hello. Happy New Year. - Happy New Year! - Happy 1938. The code of conduct says you have to take a step to the right. Come on! Dirty Jew! Great. I heard that before. - Why didn't you hit him? - I couldn't. You are right. - It was just wrong. - I have some news for you. Carola, a total stranger. I never met him before... - Just forget it. - How does he know, I am... I have news Martin! A movie? A German production. They think you have a price tag. Sure I have. But I won't be cheap. A German production. But a director from Vienna. Austrian actors. Martin. The book is totally unoffending. Not political at all. So cute. A great role. I think Berlin wants to make up with me. The dramaturge mentioned something like that. - Aren't you excited Martin? - Yes, sure I am. It's a chance. A lot of money. Think about it. Work. Film Film Film! Don't read it now. 58/20 61/4 62/15 Remove the sound please. Yes. I take the second one. Thank you everybody. I think it is great. - Great job Carola. Fabulous. - That stupid goat, is that me? You should always see the shots without sound. - Why? - Things are more clear. - What do you mean? - All that is missing. I didn't make a statement about the character, circumstances, atmosphere. Completely missed out on what was important. I learned that now. Good Night. - You just work to much. - No, this wasn't challenging at all. - Where are you going? - I'm picking up Miss Hell. - Where do I find her? - Just a second. - Are you allowed to pass? - No. I don't know. Just ask Miss Hell if she is fine with me picking her up. - Are you Mr. Hell? - Would you please do what I just said? Jews are not allowed in this place! What did you say? What did you just say? - But if you are not a Jew... - Well I am a Jew. Mind your own business. - We are in Austria. - Help. - Martin! For god's sake. We don't use Nazi methods here. Do you hear me? Got that? Martin leave him. Just leave him. Please. - Maybe someone wants to apologize. - Sure Martin. Sure. The American Consulate called. About picking up your visa. Did you hear me? About your visa! Carola. Carola please.. I don't want to force you. Why? I can stay here if I want. You just don't love me. Please give Toni a call and ask him if it's true. I met him this afternoon and asked him if he thought that you would marry me. - Why not me? - You? Why didn't you ask me? Carola please understand. You shouldn't do anything... Carola... that you don't want to do. - What did Toni say? - You would marry me. But he is against it. With the situation we're facing. Go to the Consulate tomorrow. Please. Visa for both of us. Toni said, that Schuschnigg is headed to Berchtesgarden. - What do you mean by that? - He falls for Hitler. The end is near! We start rehearsals tomorrow. Tagblatt. Schuschnigg in Berchtesgarden. Schuschnigg in Berchtesgarden. Look, he really falls for them that coward. "If we have no longer a claim upon the world, why should we seek its approbation?" "Why venture where nothing can be... ... gained and all may be lost?" "Will thine eyes sparkle less brightly reflected by the Baltic waves than by the waters of the Rhine or the Elbe?" "Where Louise loves me there is my native land!" - "We fly!" - "Pursued by your father's curse!" "No, my beloved!" "If naught but a crime can preserve you to me. " Hold on Carola. Louise was just a simple girl. She wouldn't even think about what you... - She was a Jeanne d'Arc as well! - I think so too. "Horrible enough to pierce the immortal spirit and pale the glowing cheeks of joy!" Mr. Sollnau! Schiller said: The upper class applauds while the lower class is dying. - Love and Intrigue is a political play! - That's correct. A political play. And we do it, because it is from Schiller. It's not our business how some people interpret it. We will do it how it is Ladies and Gentlemen! - It's about the concept of humanity. - You just do how you are told. - This is the only way! - The real tragedy is out on the street. - We can't have that discussion in here. - It's no Jew school. - Stop it! Dear Miss Hell. I'm not interested in politics. 5 minutes break. He will be surprised how I play Louise. I think we are always a few steps behind. With our understanding. - I think so too. Abendblatt! Abendblatt! The Chancellor's Speech! It would have been a shame listening to Viennese Music only on Broadway. I am returning our visas tomorrow. She is not going to play Julia in English. - Are you talking about me? - Yes, as always. - What did he say? - Guess it. - Ich liebe dich. I love you. Sollnau, I know you like romantic scenes only on stage, but I don't care tonight. - You have a reason to celebrate. - And you? - Sure. Me too. Cheers. Cheers. Sovary, what do you think? Sovary. What do you think? Nothing. I proudly cancelled my flight. I am a citizen of this country. So I stay, at least until Sunday. Awaiting the ballot. How will the people vote? Ebenstein, If it doesn't get cancelled, I guess... that the majority of the Austrians will vote for a free Austria. - Yes. Ladies and Gentlemen... - Ferry please. Stop that! You didn?t expect that from Schuschnigg, right? I have to admit that. - This courage. Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have you attention please. Listen to that: "For a free and German, independent and social, Christian Austria. " That's quite a lot, don't you think? At least Schuschnigg tries. - I am relieved. - Ladies and gentlemen. - Leave us alone. - Please, Ladies and gentlemen. - Please, you as well. I can't work like this! - I have to give a speech. - Why? - Schuschnigg just did. - Threats will not be tolerated. - No, we don't tolerate that. Nothing is tolerated, nothing at all. So because of that, ladies and gentlemen... - I wrote a song, if I may say so. - Show us! Quite please. Beethoven won't be jealous I guess. Should we go the the next stand or do you want to wait? - Don't wait. Leave! - We were talking about a taxi. Well I am not talking about a taxi. Are you leaving? Have you made up your mind yet? See. Why give up? There are contracts with Italy. And guarantees by the western countries. Really? Show me! Good night. "Hear me, Louisa; give me thy hand!" "As surely as I hope for Heaven's mercy in my dying hour. " "I swear that the moment which separates these hands... - "shall also rend asunder the thread!" - Yes, I know! shall also rend asunder the thread that binds me to existence!" "You terrify me! Turn from me!" "Your lips tremble!" "Your lips tremble!" - "Your eyes roll fearfully!" - What's wrong with you? - Did you fall asleep up there? - What's wrong? Take a seat. - I'm fine. - Take a seat! What's wrong with you Miss Hell? - I'm fine. - Jaded! No wonder! Why are you saying that Mr. Adam? I think the political situation leads to unstableness Mr. Brandt! Don't you think? - Quiet please! No politics in here. Politics is a dirty business. We are working in here. Are you ok Miss Hell? Out! Brandt, are you a Nazi? Indeed, I do sympathize with the National Socialist Ideology. Oh that is very beautiful. Enough. I won't let you ruin the rehearsals. Not you Miss Hell and also not Mr. Brandt with his ideology. Ruin the rehearsals? I would be a bit careful, Mr. Sollnau. End of rehearsals! We're done for today. The next time you feel sick and act childish, I send you back to school. - Good bye. - How old are you? - I really feel sick. Carola? Sick? Tired? Really tired. Exhausting rehearsals? What do you have? What do I have? What do you think? What I am going to have? A child. A child! - Martin I love you. - I love you too. You have to rest. Martin tell me how things will be. Everything will be fine. If it's a girl... If it's a girl. Martin please, pick up. - Hello? - It's Toni. - Servus Toni! - Funny you are calling. - I have to tell you something. - You are the first one to know. - The vote is cancelled! - What happened? - Schuschnigg resigned. - No. - The Germans are already at the border. - It's over! - No! Pack your suitcases. Now! - Vote cancelled? - Yes. - Schuschnigg resigned? - Yes. - Is this really true? - Come to my place. In an hour. In an hour. In the Moritzgasse. With all our belongings. - Yes! Thank you Toni. Thank you. Carola. The child! I can have another child from you if something goes wrong. But I can't have you back! - Are you vacant? - Sure! - It's a miracle! - Here you go. - To the train station. But go to the Moritzgasse first. If that's possible. Sure why not? You're welcome. - They will leave like the Turks. - Here! Here! Just a minute. - Will you wait? - If you pay for it. - Write down the license. - It is fine. Just in case. It seems like the Opera Ball tonight. Please wait for me, I have to go back to the city. - Sure, if you pay for it. - Thank you. I will hurry up. - They won't take you away? - Me? Who should do that? Some rascals like the ones before on their motorcycles? Don't make me laugh. I am going to the station master. Come with me right away Carola. Maybe he can arrange something for you.. - Martin go to the counter. - Ok. - Take the tickets. Waiting in line makes no sense. I want to stay with you! Carola he is right. Stay with him! Otherwise I will loose you. Go along! Carola! I would like to know why you are in such a good mood. You! Maybe because the border to Bratislava is already closed? How do you know that? Why do I know that? - I was there an hour ago. - Where? - There. It's closed. Nothing. Over! End! I am sure the border in Breclav is also already closed. What's the matter? He said in Breclav... It's already closed. Move. Please move forward. Step back! - This is my spot. - Step back! - We will miss the train. - So what? It makes no sense anyway. I can't do this anymore. Leave me behind. This makes no sense. - Martin! - Where is she? Don't yell. Everything is alright. You have a compartment. The station master took care of everything. Aryan journalist and Aryan actress. The luggage is already there. Cari is in the train. See. I knew people were talking nonsense in here. That they don't allow Jews in the train. That the borders are closed. The borders are closed. It is not easy to get into that train. Some people got arrested already. Now listen. Don't cause a scene. Try to make it trough the inspections. And tell Carola on the train, so at least she gets through. - Alright. - Come on now. Let's go. Halt! - Aryan? - No. Go to the inspection. No! I won't allow that. I am an Aryan journalist. Shut up. If you're Aryan, get out of here. Not you! Vorw?rts! Always the same with the Jews. Move on! Good morning. Dear god! Mrs. Schostal... What happened? My passport! Where is my passport? What happened to your head? My passport! My passport! Where is my passport? - I make you some coffee, ok? - Ok. Where is Miss Hell? - Isn't she here? - No. Occupied! The line is occupied. Hello. - Who is this? - Madam, this is Martin Hoffmann. - Do you know where your daughter is? - Well don't you know? No! I don't know. - I assume she is in Prague. - What is she doing in Prague? Let me finish my sentence please. Madam. We wanted to go to Prague last night. What a mess. She should have told me. Dear Lord. Why would you do that? Stop interrupting me. I am just afraid something might happen to my daughter. I am also a little nervous. I am also afraid that something might happen to Carola. Those people are animals out there. I tell you something Mr. Hoffmann. If you have to leave this apartment, you can stay at my place. You know the address. I know the feeling of being persecuted. It was the same in February 1934. My husband didn't do anything. He was just a Socialist. And you are a Jew. Excuse me. Thank you Mrs. Schostal. Thank You. Wait for me! Going on vacation? Or are you going to leave for good? You will notice in time. I don't know yet. I already know it. You won't come back, Mr. Hoffmann. - Good afternoon, Madam. - Do you know anything? - No, do you know anything? - Give me back my child! I will call the police. You criminal! Alois, did you hear anything from Toni Drechsler? My pleasure Mr. Hoffmann! - Nothing, Mr. Hoffmann. - What about a message from Miss Hell? No, Mr. Hoffmann. I would have told... Certainly she will be in Prague. Take a seat Mr. Hoffmann. I bring you your coffee and newspaper. Hurry up. They are coming the second time today looking for Jewish guests. Now you can do your business in New York. Paint nicely, paint nicely. House painter. No more business here. "Why venture where nothing can be gained and all may be lost?" "Will thine eyes sparkle less brightly reflected by the waters of the Rhine or the Elbe... ...than by the Baltic waves?" - We haven't heard from Miss Hell. - "We fly!" - "Pursued by your father's curse!" "A curse, which is never pronounced in vain even by murderers" One moment please. Louise was just a simple girl. - She wouldn't even think about what you... - Hold on! Just a moment! Turn on the light! Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein F?hrer! Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein F?hrer! - How can I help you? - I want to make a call to Prague. To Prague. Which number, please? 2- 6. - 2- 6. 3- 53. - 3- 53. There you are. Cognac? Two. - Cigar? - Sure. - A lovely day, isn't it? - Beautiful. - What? - Spring is coming. Middle of march, isn't it? How are things, Hoffmann? - Your lady? - Everything is fine, thanks. She is on vacation. In Prague. Great. - Trying to get a guest performance there? - I can't talk about it. I see. Things are not clear. You have to figure out. It was nice to see you. Send regards to Miss Hell. The number in Prague doesn't answer. Unfortunately. Hello Martin. What are you doing here? Andi! You are leaving? When I arrive? I have to. I have to go to the Alser Stra?e. To the Alser Stra?e. I take you there with the car. - That's very nice of you, Andi. - I parked it a block away. I couldn?t park it closer, because of that fucking fun fair. - Don't be so loud. - What? Why? - They can kiss my ass. - Come on. - I want them to hear. Here we are. - Martin! - Thank you. They even sealed the apartment. Mr. Kemetter took your commode out... Your commode, Mr. Hoffmann. The Gestapo also "confiscated" a lot of things. Those bastards. - How is your husband? - Still in jail. Or again, however you want to put it. It's better anyway. What do you want? Can't you see I am talking to this gentleman? See, Mr. Hoffmann, I didn't know until this morning. I don't know anything about my own children. Things are getting complicated... about you staying here. - Under these circumstances. - Sure. I leave anyway. Send my best regards to Miss Hell. - All the best. - Yes. The taxi! Do you recognize me? - Train station. - Ah! Sure. Last night. - 29. - What? - Schilling. That's why you are here, aren't you? You owe me 29. Well, didn't the man come back? No, he didn't. I waited until half past 10. What about you? - Didn't you leave? - I wanted to... But they didn't let me out. Do you know anything what happened to the lady? - Jew? - Yes. - Politically endangered? - Me? I am. Half and half. - Fatherland Front? - No. Why? Pichler, nice to meet you. I don't like the fellas from the Fatherland Front. And your wife? Christian? - Where did she go? - To Prague, I hope. - Well then join her. - I don't have a passport, Mr. Pichler. Confiscated. Why do you need a passport? I take you to the border and then... - And then? - You walk across it. - How much does that cost? - Regular fare. To the border about 100 Schilling. - What about that other thing? - What do you mean? Do you ask for money if you tell somebody the way? Alright then, tomorrow at 6. Where? - Doesn't matter. - Here. Alright. In the evening you will be in Prague with your wife. You just have to talk to the people. Yes, Cari called me. Even twice. She is worried about you. Very clever of you to join her. The masquerade? You never know. If the Stasi shows up here, they know who they are talking to. Nothing can happen to me. Cari arrived well in Prague. She doesn't want to talk to her mother. Things are just too much for her. She is fine. She will call again tomorrow. She told me about the child. Congratulations. What a great joy. I guess you will then marry soon. Tell her, she should leave her address at the theater. I will see her tomorrow, if things work out fine. Pardon me. Halt! Stop! - Your papers. - What papers? - Your passport. - I don't have a passport. No passport? You come with us! Halt! That way!
