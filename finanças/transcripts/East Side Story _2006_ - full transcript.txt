Yes, Mr. Border Patrol... Anything. We'll, then.. let's just see how good a cocksucker you are. But, l'm a married man. And now you're on my land. So, if y ou want to stay in the good ol' United States, you better start lickin' my huevos. [zipper opens] There you go. Hmm... Just lik e that... Daddy likes that... There you go... Nice... [knocking on door] - Dieguito? - Oh, shit! What's all that noise? Are you okay? Hello? Diego? You said your grandmother was a heavy sleeper. Get the music! [music plays] Answer me. Are you okay? You're still here? Pablo and l were watching a show about-- lllegal immigrants. lt's really humiliating the way the border patrol treat those people. True, true. lt's late. Remember we have a long day tomorrow. Well, goodnight, Do?a Sara. Good night. [DJ announces in Spanish] Will you slow down? Our employees can do that. You know... this place is going to be yours some day. The thing is l've been thinking about leaving LA and maybe opening my own restaurant. And what's wrong with this place? Abue la... l went to Culinary Academy. C'mon. l know. l paid for it. And? l need to get out of here... Make a name for myself. How could you think of leaving? There are so many memories here. You were toilet trained in that kitchen. Your mother and father - que en paz descansen - they had their last meal at that table. [door opens] Buenos d?as. Are y ou open for business? Pues claro que s?. Wow... You look great. l'll have a beer. [Ranchero music plays] You're burning the enchiladas, idiota. Where's 56? l need 56. 56? Two grilled burritos, with no beans, no rice, no guacamole and mild salsa. What kind of a wimp ordered that? And just because l danced with him, he kept chasing me around the club. Oh, thanks, Diego. Anyway, this guy from the club will not leave me alone. l think he's falling in love with me-- (Diego ) Who ordered chimichangas, extra cheese? Diego, these are my friends - Xotchil and Jasmine. - Hi. - Pleasure to meet you. Tiffany, table seven needs a diet Coke and two Millers. S?, jefe. Girl, he's so gorgeous. Did you see his butt? Did you see how jealous he was? l swear, he wants me. House prices in the ne ighborhood are going through the roof. Just look at the size of this room. lt is the perfect family room. Your loved ones can gather around here, play games, watch TV, sit by the fireplace... Perfect. How many kids did you say you have? Just two. They're twins. So, what brings you and your wife to sunny Southern California. My wife and l divorced. Sorry to hear that. l'm sure y ou'll find a nice girl though. You're young, handsome... in great shape. Do you work out? That's from carrying the kids around. Do you ever spank your children? lt depends if they misbehave. So, you're a stern little papi. We ll...children need discipline. Not just children. ls that right? That's right... So...what kind of a place are you looking for? l don't care... As long as it's far away from here. l just want to get out so we can be together. What about the twins? Enough of the role playing. Enough. l'm talking about us. We've been together for over a year. Don't you want us to be a couple? What? A couple of fags? l'm okay with that. Pablo, l don't know where y ou live. l haven't met your family-- Diego! l care about you, but look... but l need to keep my personal life low ''pro.'' - l'm getting tired of this. - We ll, l'm not. l'll ne v er get tired of y ou, my stern little papi. You sure about that? Yeah, l'm sure. Sure? That's what l said. Okay...you're gonna hav e to proveit. You're gonna discipline me? You don't know what l'd do to do to you, Mr. Real Estate. l didn't sell any houses last week. l need to be disciplined. Come on, take it off me. ( Sara ) Diego? About time - l was getting worried. Sorry. Coffee at this hour? We have a guest. ( female ) ls that Diego? Aunt Blanca? What is she doing here? What do you think? Diego... Hi. Hey, Blanca. lt's Bianca. Remember l changed my name? Blanca just sounded so barrio. So did you guys notice? l've lost ten pounds. You look great. Honey, are you sure you want coffee at this hour? lt's almost midnight. Yes, mami, but it's eight in the morning in France. l'm still on Monaco time. l'm going to bed-- No! Wait! l got gifts ! ''Monaco time?'' While you and l slave away at the restaurant? Monaco time? How much money does she want this time? l'll tell you after l see the gifts. Ah, it's beautiful. Tada ! All French women wear scarves. Gracias. Oh, my God, mami ! You look like Princess Caroline. Ten thousand. And these are for you ! l got them in Munich. Aren't those for girls? Well... l'm so tired from Cannes. Did l tell you? l am working as a party planner. lt is so much fun. Although European royalty can be so boring. And so expensive. Remember Count Von Bisquit? Von Bismark. Do y ou know that if wasn't for me he would have never regained his castle? You did it at your mother's expense. lt cost her $ 2 0,000. Don't remind me. Why did y ou have to tell him? Do you think l'm blind, Bianca? Your mother and l work our asses off at the restaurant so you can go parading around-- Diego, por favor. Baby, no. You're too good for that gigolo. That's the truth. l tried so hard to make that work. l gave him two years of my life. And $ 20,000. l promise y ou you'll get through this. You have your family. And we love you. Right, Diego? Right. [Latin music pla ys] ( male ) Dear Editor of El D?a: l ha v e liv ed in this neighborhood since 1954. This neighborhood has been my home and my refuge. And now white homos are snatching up our houses, hiking up our property taxes and forcing us poor Latinos out of our own homes. l warn y ou: lf we don't put a stop to these degenerates, we'll wind up doing their y ards and cleaning their houses. We must get rid of this before they take what is - and shall continue to be - our precious neighborhood. Sincerely, Rogelio Armando Robles. Good boy, Bimbo. Good boy! Hey, l saw that! Pick it up! How would y ou like it if l took a shit in front of your house? Sorry. Me no speak English. Well, in that case, Go fuck yourself and your dog ! You go fuck yourself, you faggot! Fuck you, you old Mexican ! - What the hell is going on? - Look at that! A dog took a shit! So what? His dog ! Call the police ! And tell them what? ln West Hollywood you can get arrested for not curbing your dog ! Jonathan, this is not West Hollywood. Think of it as fertilizer. Just pick up the mess ! l'm calling the cops. This is a pretty strong letter, Don Rogelio. Gays are people too. The hell they are. Speed it up, we open in five. Whatever you say, my jefecito. [door opens] l'm sorry, you have to leave. We're not open yet. Relax, honey. l own this place. Did you see the letter one of our employees wrote? l don't have time. Well, you better make time. Who's that talking to Diego? That's his Aunt Blanca. Blanca... what the hell have you done to your eyes? They're blue ! Don't you talk to me, you bigot. We can't let those homos move here. They set a bad example to our community. And alcoholic, womanizing men like you, don't? We need to pray for them. Yes, pray that they burn in he ll ! How can you say that? You idiot! Can't you see that my nephew is gay? Let go of me ! Let go! You know what? - You should be thanking me. - That was my secret! How would you like it if l told them you've been in an orgy? A four-way is not an orgy! And besides, what's wrong with being gay? Are you kidding? How can you even be asking me that - in this neighborhood? - Oh, screw them. - You probably have. That's it! l'm out of here ! Go ahead ! Run ! lt's what you always do. You come here, stir the shit up, and l get stuck with the mess ! You sure he never tried to touch you? Tiffany, are your tables set? What's today's special? Queer-sadillas ! Pablo, l need to talk to you. Not now! Diego-- Pablo Morales?

Oui ! Well, you must join me for lunch. l'm sorry, it's gonna have to be dinner. l'm still on Monaco Time. Get in. What the fuck is wrong with you? You should have denied it. Why? Because you don't want to be seen with a fag? l'm trying to protect you. That's bullshit. All you care about is yourself and your reputation. My reputation is very important to me. This is my turf. And nobody's gonna fuck it up! You can sell houses anywhere. We can go wherever you want. l don't care. We? There's no ''we'' here. How can you say that? We've been going out for over a year. Diego, we hook up once in a while. End of story. That's it? Yeah, that's it. And it's over. After all that we've been through? You just can't break up with me. Pablo... l love you... l do. Listen to you... You're starting to sound like a woman. [doors unlock] There you are. l made some enchiladas for the new neighbors.

But as soon as you get back, l'm lea ving. You should take some time off. Take a month off like l'm doing. l'm not talking about a vacation. l knew this day would come. l just didn't think it would be so soon. Come on, grandma. l'm almost 30. You've never lived alone. You've never had another job. You don't have any friends-- l'll be fine... Okay? l'll be fine. Well, y ou make sure you train Bianca while l'm gone because she's gonna have to take over. l'll train her. The enchiladas are getting cold. So you're okay?

Why wouldn't l? l'd reconsider leaving if l were you. l heard the word Phoenix means ''bash me'' in Native American. ''Bash me'' in Native American, huh? Yeah.

There's no business anymore. That's what l'd like to know. [scream of joy] ?S?, mi amor! lt's about time, my son ! l was beginning to worry about you ! What do you think, mami? l'm speechless. l guess that means l'm gonna be your uncle, and you're gonna be my little nephew. This is so exciting ! You're gonna have to help me plan the wedding. l'm moving to Phoenix. No, Diego, you can't leave because l need a best man. Did you hear that? He wants Diego to be the best man ! l've made plans - l'm leaving. And l'm going to put Diego in charge of the bachelor party. l've been to a few of those. They can get so wild ! l say we do it in Vegas. Oh, my God ! l don't want to know what you two are going to do over there. To the happy couple ! ?Aver un traguito! Bianca, it's me again ! l need to talk to you. Please call me. Diego Campos, t? eres el hombre de mivida. That means you're the man of my dreams. l'm really busy. l'm really tired. You don't know what kind of day l've had. l want to talk to you. Why? Shouldn't you be home? ln bed? With your boyfriend? lsn't that what boyfriends do? Jonathan and l broke up. Right, right. You guys have been together for two years, you bought a house - and you expect me to believe that it's over? Are you kidding me? S?. Get out of here. No, no quiero. l don't have time for Spanish lessons. l'm incredibly busy. l have-- Stop that! What are you doing? l need to get organized. l need to get a U-Haul. l need to finish packing. l need to get masking tape. Do you have any idea how hard it is to get masking tape in LA? lt's really hard. This fee ls really good. You say that like it's a bad thing. lt is. You're the first person l can be honest with - just be myself. l don't want to get involved. l don't. At the rate we're going, the U-Haul is going from my house right into your drive way. l'll help you unpack. l'm leaving in a week. And that's final. l know. A week... That means l have 168 hours to change your mind. 168 hours? You figured that out-- That was quick, wasn't it? lt was quick. lt's cold. ( male ) Are you sure about this? l'm not moving until l leave with what l came with. Your dignity? Too late. Wesley! Oh, him. Definitely too late. The hell it is ! Well, are y ou gonna help me or what? [honking horn] Ahem. ?Abue la ! Hi, grandma. What are you doing here? l own this place... l think. Sorry. l worked really late last night. And had a visitor. l didn't think you'd approve. Ay, Diego, por favor... What other choice do l have? You're my only grandson and l love you. l just didn't think you were with the right person. You mean, your future son-in-law? What's happened around here? l'm gone for a month, the chef dies, the restaurant is bankrupt, your ex-boyfriend is now engaged to my daughter, and l find you in bed with the gringo from across the street! You know, we talked about you running the restaurant, but l think it's best we sell. You want to sell this place? Well, l don't want to run it, and your heart is somewhere else. This way, you can go and make it on your own, be a famous chef, open your fancy restaurant. What's wrong? lsn't that what you wanted? (Wesley ) Good morning. Good morning. l'm Wesley. You must be Mrs. Campos, Diego's grandmother. Wesley. Very nice to meet you. Call me Sara. How was Mexico? Guadalajara is beautiful. l've decided to retire there. You have? Yeah. When? ln about two weeks. There's no reason for me to stay here - especially now that Diego is leaving. Pablo could se ll this place. He y, you better talk to Bianca about her fianc?. l've tried. l've left over four messages. Ay, she'll never learn. Don't l look like a princess? l fucked Pablo. Excuse me? Pablo and l have been screwin' around for over a year. Cut it out. That's not funny. l'm serious. You're lying. Pablo wants to marry me. We're having children together. l didn't want to tell y ou. Trust me, l didn't. lt's true. Ask Pablo. l get it. This is a joke, right? Where is he? Pablo come out here. Come out wherever you are. Bianca ! Pablo is never coming out. You're making all this up. No, l'm not. l wish l were, but l'm not. Okay... describe his penis. Fat, uncut, with a dark beauty mark-- [loud scream] Jonathan... Jonathan ! Are you okay? Did you see who did it? l ran out because l heard noises... They ganged up on me... they held me down... Did they? Worse...they... Oh, my God. l'm so scared... Pablo! You better call me. Now! - ls that the dress you want? - The wedding is off! l am serious, you fucking cocksucker! l am leaving and l'm never coming back. Your Dieguito can tell you what happened. Oh, good. You told her! You knew? You guys are sick. No! You stay away from me ! What's wrong with me? Why can't l find lov e just like everyone else? l am beautiful, l am funny, l'm a great cook... l give great head ! ?Ay, Bianca ! ?Por favor! You never loved me. You've always preferred your grandson. - El mariconcito. - No! Let's talk about this like a family. Like a family? What a joke ! No! Don't go! Let's talk about this ! Please ! l'm sorry l didn't tell you ! Bianca ! Hi. lt's me... Diego... Your nephew... El mariconcito. Listen, l'm thinking of stay ing in LA. And l think you should come back and, you know... help me run the restaurant, if you want... Okay, call me. Run the restaurant? We've had no customers since Don Rogelio died. Ay, con candles y todo. Qu? romantic. ls that for us? lt's for me and my boyfriend. l have a date. l guess conversion therapy never works. Don't say that. lt worked for Mr. Mart?nez and Mr. Gonz?les. Not really. l heard they left their wives and ran away together. They're opening up a bed and breakfast... in Ensenada. Come on, don't cry. Sounds like they're happy. Maybe. l just wish you and l would have been happy together. (Wesley ) l'm sorry. l can come back later. No, it's okay. l was just leaving. Good luck. lf you hurt him, l will kill you. Guess what? l've been thinking about it... and l don't want to move to Phoenix anymore. l'm staying. You are? Yeah. lsn't that what we discussed 12 hours, 10 minutes and 2 seconds ago? Diego, we need to talk. Oh, shit. What's wrong? Am l moving too fast? Maybe l should have warned you - Latinos, we don't mess around. When we fall, we fall. l don't know if y ou'v e heard, but last night our house was vandalized and poor Jonathan was attacked, beaten up. What was he doing there? You said y ou guys broke up. - You lied to me? - No. We had broken up... So, y ou're back together? You don't understand. There's a lot of history between Jonathan and me. l do understand. l was just the flavor of the week - right? That's not true. You went South of the Border, sampled the menu, liked it... but now you're back to your comfort food. You are so special to me-- No. Stop. You do not get to dump me and still be the nice guy. Diego, l-- Go! Just go! Get the fuck out of here ! Remind whoever buys the restaurant that the fridge is brand new. So make sure you charge them extra. l'm gonna miss you. What's wrong with you? You're making the right choice. You're getting out of here. l'm the one who should be crying. l know. l'm going to move Phoenix, l'm gonna work hard... make it on my own. That's right. That's the spirit. But if things don't work out, you can come live with me. l have this beautiful house in Guadalajara. l have this room that overlooks the Plaza. lt's a guest bedroom just for you. l'm gonna paint it blue. You come and stay with me. Okay? Let's go. But anytime, you come and visit me. Hello. How was Europe? Europe? Honey, l ran out of cab fare in Riverside. What are y ou doing here? What do you mean? You left me a message begging me to come back and help you run the restaurant. Things have changed. We need to sell. We're broke. Well, l don't think we should sell. With all the gays moving into town, this is becoming a very fashionable neighborhood. l say that we fix up the place, change the menu, double the prices, of course... You can be the chef and l'll be the hostess. l told you l'm leaving L.A. lt would just be for a couple of months. Forget it... l won't be here. We can mak e tons of money and have so much fun ! You'll be the hottest chef in town ! Oh, my God - and so popular with the boys. Can you hear me? l'm leaving. All right? l already made plans. You can't go. You have to stay. l don't have to do anything - for anyone. Diego, please... l have nowhere to go. All right... Let's just say that l was to help you... just for a couple of months. All right? We need money. Where are we gonna find that? Everything is gonna work out. Somos familia. l even figured out a way to forgive Pablo. l'll kill that bitch ! Shit! l don't believe this ! l'll fuckin' kill this bitch ! Wes, honey, you better get dressed. Adam and Steve are going to be here soon. Or is it Steve and Adam? The top usually goes first. l called them and told them the deal is off. l'm not selling. Oh, come on. Not again. l'm not moving. Well, l am. Then go. You're gonna have to buy me out. Whatever you want. And l'm warning you, it's gonna cost you. Real estate prices have gone up, which means... which means we did something right. l better start packing. Jonathan... Don't forget this. l found it in your car. Not bad for a Tuesday night. Not bad at all, Mr. Chef. Hello, l'm Marisol. And l ordered some food to go. l'll be right with you. Another bottle of Pinot Noir for table five. Right away, Miss Campos. Call me Blanca. Hey, what's taking so long? l'm so sorry, papi. lt's coming. How much do l owe you? lt's on the house. Bon appetit. That's sweet. They're giving it to us for free. Let's just go. Listen, l know you want to move, but would you consider staying a little longer? We're doing so well - l don't want to jinx it. l'll be right there... Just think about it. Please. Felicidades, se?or chef. Hi. l wanted to go to the restaurant, but l wasn't sure y ou were ready to see me yet. Staying? For now. Yeah. Here. A silver bracelet. How original. Turn it around. l had your name engraved on it. lt has a date on it. That's not my birthday. lt's the first time we made love... And hopefully not the last. l guess we'll see... Won't we?
