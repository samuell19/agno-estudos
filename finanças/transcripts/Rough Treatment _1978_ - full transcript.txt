ROUGH TREATMENT screenplay cinematography director it was during the war between Honduras and El Salvador... - I was there. - The Football War? - Football? - Yes, that's what it was called. I found myself completely alone because all the other correspondents had left for El Salvador. They thought the attack would be launched from there. It so happened that there was only one telex and the president of Honduras happened to be standing by it, calling for assistance. So I found myself in a hopeless situation, as I could not force him to leave because then Honduras would lose the war. If I may be serious, how many times have you been threatened with execution? Absolutely seriously. Four times. - And how many revolutions have you witnessed? - Many. Twice in Cuba. The first time when Fidel took Havana. The second was the Bay of Pigs. Later on I was in Chile, first during the failed coup during president Frei's administration, and then when Allende was killed. Peru, Bolivia, I was in Venezuela with the guerrillas. Then with the Tupamaros in Uruguay. I witnessed the revolt of the Brazilian peasants in Nordeste. And Africa, there were so many coups there, at least a dozen. What other threats, besides death, must a journalist like you face? I was thrown out of various countries repeatedly because the authorities did not like my writing. So what is your greatest fear? Defeat - I have lived through several failures. Fortunately, I've never experienced a true defeat. Which I understand as a kind of, well, physical weakness, stillness, being forced to give up my profession, the life that I lead, a general humiliation, indignity, powerlessness. Is there a reason why you write about Third World countries and not your native country? - That's a very good question. - Well, I think so. Next one, please. Well but aren't all these foreign travels something of tourism, combined with extra money and greater prestige? Well, money. A Chilean friend of mine told me once that he was a socialist all his life, actually he never made it, except for gaining some underappreciated things. He had a wife who was his best friend and children who were his greatest joy. - And what happened to him? - He's dead. But what does it have in common with my question? Well, I also have a wife and children, and the man was my friend. And why isn't she, I mean your wife, here? I'll switch it off. - Don't, Ewunia. - Let me quote my favorite writer, Michał Bałucki: A wife is not a zoo to be shown around. I don't want you to watch it. Don't be silly, I don't mind, really. - I was born - But that's not what I mean. In a small town in the province of Lublin, so I had friends with whom - I went to school and - So don't look. We were real friends. It all fell apart later on. Today one of them is a Professor at the institute of technology, one is a priest, - Do you love me? - one committed suicide. - Do you? - A few have farms over there. I have to go now. Now? Yes, I have to call in on my mom. I want to pick Gabcia up. - Are you taking Gabcia? - Yes, it'll be easier this way. I don't think he'll have the courage. Well, so what is the conclusion of these comparisons? - You're right. - I guess it is simply about some point of reference. - Tomorrow, my dear. - There is no other truth about a time than the truth reflected in human biography. What truth or what truths were reflected in your biography? To present a biography is to answer simple questions: who one is, who one wants to be, who one can be. In such a case, who would you like to be? - Who I am. - And who could you be? - Nobody else. - Well, but it means that your biography is a complete success. Well, it seems so. You have told us of your ties with your friends from the editorial board. We'd like to show you our TV version of the ties. Ladies and gentlemen, please rise. As you can see, the ties are very real, they also offer a kind of safety measure, naturally, like in mountaineering. - Will they be able to keep upright? - I doubt it. What you say, what you write... Listen, did they check the formula of this program with you? They did. You must remember it. You liked the idea very much. Well. I just saw it somewhat differently. Well, the screenplay was rather specific. If one lacks this instinct, or can't at least develop it, one doesn't stand any chance of doing what I do, I mean, writing reportage. - Because when this instinct burns out... - And who decided to show this Michałowski first? He's a great journalist, a very popular person. Award of the Year. Amazing book. It's Friday, before the weekend. People expect something else. There will be complaints, and rightly so. - That's not what we talked about. - When you read newspapers, watch TV, you notice that all the news about the world is flattened, made up, undefined. To put it in a word, it's deceitful, actually. A number of events are hushed up. And silence is - Oh, daddy! - a most dangerous thing. - Well, it's daddy. - Historians deal in, let's say, coups, revolutions, rebellions. But when a mother hears silence in her baby's room, driven by some instinct, she runs there, with a premonition that something terrible must have happened. I think that silence plays the same role in history. It would be most interesting to enquire into the following issue: to what extent the modern - media are in the service of - What happened? - Real information, - Mummy! - And to what extent in the service of silence. - What happened? - I'm taking Gabcia to the airport. - Well, I have to get her dressed. No, leave her, Józefa will dress her, leave her, mom. I use the word "truth" with caution and respect. I decide in my conscience what I am to write about, and what I don't want to or can't write about. - You have to experience it - Calm down, honey, calm down, - yourself in order to be able to decide... - don't be so nervous. I'll bring her back in an hour. Is it OK, mom? - OK. - I'm simply there, - Just calm down. - so I do understand - Gabcia, let's go. - many things and know them better than those who never go there. Polish Airlines LOT flight number 246 from Rome is arriving shortly. Buńka. Dear, dear Buńka. - Daddy, you're on TV. - What do you mean? That's impossible! How tall you've grown. Good afternoon. - How are things? - What have you brought me? Oh, it's a surprise. - Show me. - Not now, at home, at home, at home. Let's go. Has Ola called? Daddy, you're on TV. - What are they doing here? - Expanding the airport. Great. Ewa, what is it? Come here for a moment. - Jerzy, we've moved out. - Excuse me? Me and Gabcia have moved out. Are you mad? Well, we won't discuss it in front of our child. Don't look for me, my lawyer will send you the divorce papers. Polo. Polo, Polo, come on. Drink, doggie, drink. Mom, why are you crying? You have a wet nose. Be quiet! I'm sorry, my dear. I'm sorry, honey. It's all right now. Family - we've asked about it already, only to be rebuffed. You're always away, always on the move. You're constantly away, constantly absent. - How do they react to it? - I'm not away, I travel. - Does that change anything? - I leave and I come back. And they wait because they know I'll be back. Do you have a spare moment, please, forgive me if it sounds childish, for dreams? - Sometimes on the plane. - What about? About my children not being ashamed of - what I do - Excuse me? - At the moment, what I write. - Mom? It's Jurek. Are you pleased with yourself? I'd like to ask if Ewa is there? - No, she's not. - Did she say when she was coming back? - Don't you know where... - No, she didn't say anything. Before we say goodbye, although you defended yourself with a quote from Michał Bałucki, and forbade us to touch upon the subject, our director still prepared a movie for you, I hope it'll be a nice surprise. Please, turn around once more. May I call later? It's pointless to call, even if she's here she won't talk to you. Stenia, please, change the water. - Why? - Because it's you who's calling. Stenia, what is it with you today?! Please, concentrate and prepare for the extraction. I am extracting the right upper second premolar. - I see. - No, you don't. - You've horribly neglected your teeth. - How long has this been going on? Not even a month, I guess. I also thought it was madness, we even had a big fight. I lashed out at her but she's crazy. No, she's not thinking straight at the moment. Jerzy, listen, it's foolish feminine obstinacy. I told her: think about the children, especially about Gabcia, anyway, you love him because he loves you. In half a year, what am I saying, half a year, in a month you'll come to your senses, and you'll regret it bitterly that for some - spoiled kid... - Do I know him? - No, didn't she even tell you? - And who is it? Don't you know? Well, after all I am her best friend, I couldn't cut myself off completely out of the blue. How could I know she was so serious about it? This is the way it is when a woman is faithful all her life. Just a fleeting affair and she imagines the world. I believe, and I often told her so, that it is sometimes healthier for a marriage when a woman... Well, let's get to work. Rinse and spit. Jerzy... No, no, no anesthetic, I am more afraid of that than of the extraction itself. - You won't stand it without anesthetic. - I will. If only it were someone interesting but he's a stuck up nothing in glasses. Stenia, please, prepare coffee for me, three spoonfuls and a little water. - Not the dishwater you usually make. - But you haven't said if I know him. No, you can't know him, he's only just arrived in Warsaw. I don't even know what he does. He writes, poems, I guess... Well, nothing. It seems to me that he is the kind of man that a woman may look after. It may amuse her for a while, it's something new. No woman with a bit of instinct of self-preservation would fall for such a thing. But she doesn't have the instinct, she's simply spoiled. She never had to fight for anything. Your behavior is inexplicable. Oh! God, as one cynic used to say, save me from physical pain, I can bear the spiritual kind. Move your head. And her complaints that when Gabcia was born you... OK? You left. Freedom. She says she's after freedom. She needs a new guy, not any freedom. I told her, if you cared for freedom, you wouldn't jump into the arms of another guy. Stenia, my God, when are you going to learn to use a tray? Don't you know what people invented trays for? And you were not completely blameless either. Well, don't worry, don't worry. - She'll be back. OK? - Well, OK. You were too polite, too meek. When a man is so polite, a woman thinks he doesn't care for her. Try to start a big fight, a real full-blown argument. Beat her up a bit. Then she'll know she has a real man. Every woman needs it. Wider, come on, wider. OK. Calm down. Oh, calm down! Quiet! Silence! Just a moment! It's enough if you find some girl, she'll feel threatened and she'll come back right away. Grit your teeth, yes, that's right. Cold compress for the night. Hold on. Everybody thinks it won't happen to him. At least, not in such a banal, such a trivial way. - Without getting to Płock. - I see, I see, yes. I'm coming to you. Just a moment, I have a client. Good morning. You summoned me. I did? I could only invite you. What's your name? - Jerzy Michałowski. - Michałowski. Michałowski. Michałowski. Just a moment. Yes, now I know everything, sir. - So as far as... - Just a moment, just a moment. Maria, may I? Just a second. Maria, is there a spare typewriter? Please, here, start from the words: it resulted in a feeling of inferiority in the plaintiff, a sensitive, ambitious person, right? And so on, the whole page. I'm done. As far as the case about which you did summon me is concerned, I'd like to say that I am not going to agree to a divorce. I don't know what my wife told you about our marriage. I don't think it's any worse than others which are considered outstanding. - Probably even better. - Yes, sir. Could you speak up? I want to say that I am not going to agree to a divorce. - You're not? - I don't know what my wife told you about our marriage. But I don't think it's any worse than others which are considered - outstanding, probably even better. - Well. Worse, better, sir, it's not what it's all about. The thing is that your wife simply doesn't want to live with you. She does not. She believes that there never was any real connection between the two of you - firstly, intellectual, secondly - emotional, thirdly - physical. The truth is that you are two completely different people who once thought they loved each other. And today, as a mature woman, she's come to the conclusion that it simply didn't make sense to continue this routine, one might say, - superficial life together. - Excuse me? - I am very sorry. - Superficial life together. What is it? Oh, Jesus, the defendant abuses alcohol, throws drinking binges in his apartment, well, children, I am very sorry. Have you ever heard about the building-block theory? No. Building blocks - they either fit or they don't. And after 15 years she wants to... the blocks... Sir, my role is limited to providing legal advice to your wife who wishes to dissolve your marriage which she finds unsatisfactory. Anyway, she has more specific allegations. What will she do if I don't agree? If you don't agree then, according to procedures, we will have to do the following: prove an irreconcilable breakdown of the union, - do you understand? - I do. Which means: sexual deficiency, refusal to support the family, aggression, neglecting the family, well, many such unpleasant matters. I'm curious how you can prove it since it's not true. Well, but it can be proven. Let me be honest, sir... Frankly speaking, I am an avid reader of your work. What do you need this for? What for? Shouldn't decent people deal with such matters in a decent way? Think, even if you get the divorce in the end. You'll leave the court so angry that you will hate each other. You have children to consider, after all. We might arrange the whole matter quickly, peacefully, painlessly. We would decide jointly on the causes of the breakdown. The problem is that there was no breakdown. Well, let's just get things straight: you don't agree to decide on - the causes of breakdown. - No, I don't. - Or on the content of the claim. - No. Or to petition for a divorce without assigning blame. I don't agree to the divorce at all. Well, I will let my client know your opinion. By the way, it is quite interesting how she can prove any fault of mine. You know, with all due respect, even from the few years of my practice, I must tell you that everything can be proven. About all of us. And fault... Well, my God, it is a most flexible concept resulting from assessment. It was nice to meet you, sir. Thank you very much. Well, are there any other suggestions? - Where has he come from? - He's with us now. I must admit I am surprised with the way of presenting and accepting candidates here. Maybe instead of turning our discussion into jokes, as you do it, we will try to present our proposals in a precise, specific and accurate way. - It will not be too difficult for me. - Very well. Let's get to the point, gentlemen. My, let's just say, exaggerated reaction to your proposal, Mr..., Mr... with us now, was simply caused by the fact that I found the juxtaposition of these books quite shocking. Dear colleagues, it's often said that reportage has replaced the contemporary novel. I think that in this particular case we are faced with such a phenomenon. Mastecki's book is by the way something more than a mere collection of reportage. In my opinion, the author has managed to show various, quite difficult aspects of our life, I mean, personal, professional, social, political, in their mutual intertwining. Well, we all know how difficult it is. It seems that we've been waiting for a book like this for many years. And not just us, because the interest readers have in the book is also something of an obligation for us. What more can I say? The truth simply shines out of this book. I know, truth is an over-used word, sometimes I forget myself what it's really supposed to mean. But as I was reading "A Shorter Week" I had the impression, which happens rather seldom, that I am faced with a true image of our reality and our real, I think I may say so, literature. While Koleba's book... there is nothing to talk about there. - Are you done? - Yes. Gralak, there is also Gralak. "Poland for Tourists". - Well, Gralak. - Gralak. Precisely. In fact we do have another candidate. Maybe Mr Rościszewski would like to have a word? Listen, let's leave it alone. Naturally, we may vote on both candidates, but we know anyway what we should think about it. Maybe we really should vote. Well, actually, we may. - I'd rather... - Let's vote. Just a moment. I think that, especially in this company, we are obliged to be honest, truly honest. Let's not give in to deception. I must confess that I read Mastecki's book very thoroughly and attentively. You claim that it is an account of our reality. Well, I am also a Pole. I live here and now. In our country. I travel around Poland somewhat more than Mr Michałowski, who naturally visits other places. I am absolutely convinced that the country described in "A Shorter Week" is a country which isn't there. No such country exists. And now to Kuleba's book. It is a book written from the heart, not with venom. A book without mockery. A truly courageous book. Because it takes courage to show what is great, sublime, and beautiful. And not the margins, dullness, and meaninglessness. Thank you, I'm done. Well, this was good. Although I don't know Mr Rościszewski, it seems that we finally have among us a true demagogue. - Jerzy, let go of it. - Who we so badly lacked. Who is Mr Rościszewski? Colleagues, I have worked in this profession for 20 years and I know perfectly well how such speeches and such books as that by Koleba should be treated. I believe that during all these years I have established, well... some authority. If you trust me at all, you must believe me that Mastecki's book is the best book of the year. What authority are you talking about? Who gave it to you? You're asking who is Rościszewski? And I am asking - who is Michałowski? Who gave you the right to evaluate people? It's time to understand that the days of authorities from coffeehouses are over. You behave as if you had the world to back you up. But there is nothing except the coffeehouse! - Which coffeehouse? - Telimena. I am not going to enter into a discussion with this gentleman, because you can hardly speak here about an exchange of views. However, colleagues, the matter is truly extremely important. This book is good and we must award it. - This book is... - A typical product of conformism. - Half-courage in throwing half-truths. - Holy shit! If you think these are half-truths, you must forgive me! This is the maximum of what may be written today! Well! Well! What do you mean, "may be written"? You've just confirmed my general charge that the facts, which the author offers to interpret, are presented in a typically conformist way. May - may not. Allowed - no allowed. Will it or won't it be published, right? Well, colleagues, Koleba does not use such criteria. Oh yes, you are quite right here. Koleba uses completely different criteria. Let's go back then to your reasoning and the differentiation: you may - you may not. What book would you write if you, as you expressed it, - could? - Let me tell you. I would write a book about you, unfortunately, it's impossible. Yes, I've read it but I must say that... Well, that was stupid. You could have guessed that in the current situation Mastecki didn't stand a chance. If you had not escalated the situation, the award would've gone to Gralak, and this way this whippersnapper got it. I also think it's a shame for the whole newspaper and I understand you perfectly well. OK, OK. There is nothing to talk about. You don't get it? I guess you know that a man of your talent won't be everybody's darling. He won't be liked in his milieu. They are small people. And as you like people better than nature, they'll be trying to use it against you. I don't see the point in your passivity. And who told you I was passive? Listen, I can't get involved in minor issues because then I lose arguments in the important ones. Listen, you can never commit yourself to hopeless lost causes. OK, will you have a drink? Excuse me that I didn't offer anything any sooner. What is it? Why are you so irritated? Jurek, we're both much wiser than all this talking. The worst thing that may happen to a man like you is the loss of the instinct of self-preservation. And as for your wife - you should be careful. What do you mean - be careful? Yes? Put him through, please. I saw you on TV yesterday. Unfortunately, I wasn't the only one. Yes? Listen, I have to say goodbye now. Call me when you have any problems. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. And how is Ola? In Moscow? Yes. Are you happy? Is she studying well? Thank you so much for arranging it for me. It's nothing, don't mention it. - And don't eat anything for 2 hours, please. - Yes, thank you, I know. Hello. Jerzy. - Has anything happened? - No, nothing. It just seems to me that I have understood everything. Come in, please. I've just understood, you know, that a single conversation with Ewa, just one honest conversation... - Do you really believe it? - I'll tell you more, I am convinced that she believes it too. She believes that one such conversation would remove all this absurdity completely. And that is why she's afraid. She's afraid, afraid, afraid, afraid, afraid, that it will turn out that her decision was pointless. Well, and the decision, once made... she has to cling to it now desperately. I understand it perfectly well. And I just wanted to ask you to tell her, that I understand everything, that I respect it. - Am I to tell her that? - Excuse me? I'm to tell her that, aren't I? Am I to talk to her? Don't you understand that they've trapped her? That they're hiding her from me? I can't get in touch with her in any way. I can't find her in any way. - Zip me up here. - What? - Just imagine that I for three days... - Not here, come on... It's OK now. I waited for three days in front of her house. And I didn't see her. I wrote to her. Several times. Naturally, I know that she didn't receive any of my letters. Which is why I came to you. Why? I know perfectly well that you know where she is. Don't be afraid, you won't have to tell me. I just want to ask you a favor, give it to her. Leave me alone, all of you! One comes here to whine, the other is crying on my shoulder. Crying? Are you saying that she cries? I knew it. She cries. This is no way to do it. You should have some more dignity. You humiliate yourself and what are you thinking about? You think she's a saint?! I told you what you were to do and how to act. No, no, no. Ambition doesn't matter. My ambition. The point is to make her understand that I bear no grudge. To stop her from being afraid of a conversation with me. You know, I always thought that there were spheres of life where you can never accept a compromise. Especially in relationships. But now I've understood that it is actually the only sphere of life in which compromise is acceptable. If she comes back, I'll accept all her conditions. No jealousy. I know, I was certainly too sure of myself, I treated her like I owned her. Yes, this is the way I treated her. She understood it and... Decided to punish me. And she was right. But I know that everything we still have... is more important than all ambition, big and small. I am certain that she is... that she shares this view. Does it mean you won't agree to divorce her? - Oh no, no way. - Well, but... No, no, no, it's absolutely out of the question, do you understand? It's a very foolish tactic. This isn't any tactic, it's my life. You should have more dignity. I don't give a shit about dignity. I beg of you, Wanda, take it to her... Please, Wandzia. I beg of you, take it to her. Well, OK, I'll try to - see her tomorrow. - No, no, no, not tomorrow. Today, today, now. I beg of you, Wanda. I beg you, take it and go to her right now, will you? I'll fetch your coat. You've lost your mind. - But... - Put it on. Please. - Give me your hand. - Well, all right. - Go, I implore you. - Well, but my handbag... - So where's the handbag?! - Stop behaving like a lunatic, my dear. Where is your handbag? Oh, here it is. Take the handbag. I beg you. Take a taxi. - You're mad. - Go now. Well, let's be frank, the question is both general and difficult. - Allow me - Turn it up. Start from stating that the world expects us to make a choice. To take sides. - You see... - Choosing involvement... it makes no sense at all. They cut it all up. Look, it lost its natural context. - Ewa. - This girl is a little stiff, but you're quite all right. You don't have to pay me undeserved compliments. I know it's no good. I know it's good for nothing. Jacuś, it was great for a first performance. - About the awarded book - You don't have to take it to heart. Jan Koleba's book entitled "Really in Our Place". Although the pseudo-elite circles do not like this kind of truth. - It may be the other way round. - Anyway... You remained in the countryside. What chances do you see... - What have you done? - I know very well you don't want to watch it. You don't have to force yourself. You can watch a movie. Jacek, I don't want to watch a movie. I understand, you're upset, but why do you behave this way? You talk of stage-fright, being upset. It's impossible to be frank with you. I understand it. You're not used to being frank. Jacuś, what are you babbling on about? To your success. You know I don't drink. I came off like an idiot? He speaks much better. A TV personality. Yes, you like it. This cheap exhibitionism. Disregard for people. And at the same time playing to the gallery. A cheap allusion here, a caustic remark there. Look, how intelligent I am, look, how honest I am. I will toady to those in the know. Well, they know how to do it. They know it very well. Rotten goods packed up in shiny cellophane. - Who are you talking about? - You know very well who I'm talking about. But I haven't taken classes in eloquence. I didn't not go to the best schools in the capital. I didn't practice the language of lies in coffeehouses and salons! But, Ewunia, I will not sell myself. Jacuś, I know. I compromised myself and they took advantage of it. They are waiting for me to take a false step. What "they"? Jacek, nobody watched it. What do you mean "nobody"? The wrong people certainly did. - You're the best anyway. - Do you really believe it? I do. Yes, because you're frank. Because you're always right. Because you always get everything right. And do you think that people understand it? Certainly. Ewa, he never watches himself on TV, does he? - Well, it depends. - Well. He doesn't care. He is self-assured, he believes in his own charm, his name. But he'll take a wrong step. - Wanda. - May I? Please, come in. Why the flowers? - Is Ewa home? - Yes, she is. Oh, Wanda. I'd like to... Here you are. - Talk to you. - Should I leave? Yes, would you make us some tea, please? You could at least read it. - What for? - It's cowardice. - Anyway. - What am I to tell him? - I don't know. - But I have to tell him something. Tell him whatever you want. That I felt too well with him, or too bad, or that he is too interesting, or too boring. - Say whatever you like. - Listen, can this Jacek offer you any support? Oh, it's a completely opposite arrangement. - Do you love him? - I do. - Will you marry him? - I don't know. So? You see, he is completely different from what you think. He is helpless. He is terribly afraid that his life will turn out a complete failure. - If I... - If what? You see, if I left him he'd drink himself to death. - Not a chance. - And how can you know that? Anyway, this is not what it's all about. And what is it about? Goodbye, Jacek. Bye. He writes to you, doesn't he? - Yes. - What? - It's not important. - I guess I do have the right to know. Jacek, you have no right. Jacuś, wait. I don't read these letters at all. Look, they are not even opened. - I can tear them to pieces now, if you want me to. - Oh, no, keep them. These must also have come from him. Katarzyna, what happened? Where are my students? Could you check the schedule, please? I haven't been notified about anything. - What's going on? - Your lecture is not scheduled for this semester. - Why? - You asked for it to be cancelled yourself, due to your travels. No, I haven't cancelled anything. They were to begin this week and I notified Mrs Kruszewska about it. Maybe Mrs Kruszewska knows something about it, I'm only responsible for the schedule. - And I was to cancel your lectures. - On whose order? I received the plans from Mrs Kruszewska. You will have to set it straight with her. Aha, yes, I'll tell her, I know what's going on here, naturally, yes. Well, I'll discuss it with the dean, goodbye. I'm sorry, sir. Hush, he's coming. - Good morning, professor. - Good morning. - I see the whole group here. - That's right. - What is it about? - We came... Well, speak up. - Actually, it was Piotrek. - Piotr, where is he? Piotrek! - Good morning, professor. - Good morning. We couldn't contact you on the phone, it's about your seminar. It's very important for us. Just a moment, I thought you were notified. That's the whole thing, we were notified. We heard that you were forced to step down. I know nothing about it. Well, this is the way such things are adroitly arranged. They took away our best seminar. We've written a petition - and we'd like to discuss it with you. - Excuse me? - The petition. - An application. Just a moment, just a moment. May I explain something? The first thing is that nobody forced me to resign. - There was just a... well, - Yeah. An unfortunate coincidence. I was supposed to leave for a longer period and the dean's office suspended our seminar. - But why weren't we... - Because, just a moment. As the date of my trip changed, another class was scheduled in place of my seminar. It's too late to change anything back now. We have to wait until next year. But we asked at the dean's office - and the whole thing seems fishy. - I assure you it was a coincidence. - Coincidence. - What coincidence could that have been? When a man like you is involved, it's rather difficult to talk of coincidence. You know, when I was your age it also seemed to me, that everything is the result of some big politics. And such incidents are most often simply the effect of some general mess. - May I see it for a moment? - Here you are. Oh, it's been published already and I knew nothing about it, they didn't even send me a copy. Could you write a dedication for me? - But I have nothing to write with. - Just a sec. Listen, if I may give you some advice, you should be more cautious about any petitions. God forbid that I would advise prevarication, or stop you from speaking out in cases that you truly care about. - Thank you. - You're welcome. But a petition. A petition is always a collective action. Which is why it should be used in a responsible way. Which means one must be certain that such an action will lead to a specific aim, it will be effective. Which means we're screwed. You know what? Let's go upstairs to my place. Come on, let's talk there, I mean it. It's rather cold here. I have some, well, some alcohol there. Come on, come on. Don't be shy. Girls, come on. Come on. But it's not a problem. Come on, let's go in. - And what about you? - No, no, thank you, professor. Come on, Agata, let's go. What is it with you? You know, I don't understand you at all. Why don't you listen to me? Please, look at me. Agata. Let's assume that someone was abandoned by his wife. Has anything happened? Nothing, it seems. The law says it did. Have you ever considered why people get married? I have always imagined that there is such a thing as the metaphysics of marriage. No, it's banal. I mean intimate relationships, shared, shared objects, shared compromises, losing shame towards each other. Or simply the fact that we move towards death together, that we get old together. Tell me what there is to hold on to, if there is no certainty. If it's so, what has any value? How can one suddenly say: I don't want to be with you anymore, I'm leaving. It means that everything there was before loses meaning. Is it really possible that the closest person suddenly becomes an enemy, a stranger? Am I to be nice about it? Understand... it seems to me that a man should fight for certain values he finds important, for love... What? No one can be forced to love? You talked of marriage, someone abandoned by his wife. That you discovered no criteria, and that you can't accept it. You can understand that but you didn't see the point of our petition. And the fact that your boss may not only push you aside, but paint you out of the picture. You're just waiting for justice to happen, for some just criteria to appear. It, dear sir, is both wrong and harmful. But these two matters have nothing in common. You didn't get anything of what I was saying. You don't even suspect how the two matters are connected. No, no, it's OK. All right, boys. Maybe they are connected, actually. We're going. Come on. We're going. Thank you, professor. - My dear daughter... Gabuńka... - Daddy. Come to daddy, come on, come on. Sit down. What have you brought? - What is it? - Sir, her mother must never learn that I came to you with Gabcia. I have told Gabcia as well. I can't stay there any longer, sir. The old lady told me what I was to say in court during the divorce trial. Well, I said I would never say a word against you. The poor child is suffering. You never said a single bad word to me. - How does Ania... - So how am I to testify against you? Well, you know, I am all for you, - I just don't know how much. - Play with the horse a bit. I'm sorry for Gabcia. She keeps on asking where her daddy is. Has he left? When is he coming back? So I told her today we should go to daddy, but mum's the word. You know, they say that I turn her against Jacek, and I know that the girl herself can feel that he's a thief. - Well, please, don't exaggerate. - A thief, a thief, sir. He came to other people's home and spoiled everything, a con artist. Well, well, well. And Gabcia is afraid of it all. You know, she's started to bite at her fingers when she falls asleep. Her fingertips... She has bitten them so hard that they bleed. It's all because of her nerves. We'll go now, sir. What is it, Gabrynia? Daddy, why don't we live here anymore? What? Tell mommy, that... Tell mommy that you don't want to see uncle Jacek any more, will you? And say he should never come back again. And tell her that you want to be with mommy and daddy, will you? And you will tell her today, OK? Please, wait here, Józefa, I will buy her something. Don't cry, my dear, don't cry, stop now. Come on, stop crying, don't cry. What is it, Gabuńka? Calm down, now. You can't understand simple things. Thirty years... - Zosia. - Yes, sir? Could you come here a moment? - Excuse me? - Where are my "Newsweeks"? Well, you're not getting them anymore. According to the distribution list. What do you mean, I am not getting them? Why are there two desks here? Where are the "Sterns"? If you need them, maybe you can take mine? What are you doing here, actually? Haven't you been notified yet? Why are you standing here like this?! Zofia. Yes, sir? Please, make sure that Mr Jerzy gets all the press. - Well, but... - Have I made myself clear? Yes, I see. A horrible scatterbrain. So? Is everything OK now? Yes, listen. I may not be in the best shape right now. You know, I thought... Well, I came here to discuss certain things, I am not sure if you know that Ewa... I mean, we've split up, temporarily. And that is why I did not agree to go then. You know, I thought now that if I could leave, I would gain some time. It's a question of two or three weeks, anyway. I would... simply give her a chance to come to her senses, because when I'm here I feel helpless. I'm afraid I'm going to do something stupid. - Well, well. - No, I mean, you know, I want to avoid doing something I can't take back. I... Actually, I don't even know if I'm thinking right, - what do you think? - Well. I think you really should leave. I'll call the association immediately, they are certain to find a room for you in Zakopane. You know, they won't refuse you of all people. What are you talking about? I'm not talking about a rest. Rest is precisely the most horrible torment. I am talking about that invitation from the UN. - I want to get to work finally. - This is what it's about. Well... Well, I think the offer is no longer valid. - You gave it up yourself. - But you kept telling me all this time that only I can go, that I still have time to make the decision. You see, you're getting upset again. Well, some changes have taken place. Who's going? No one from us. Tell me frankly. You were told not to let me go. Who told you that? And why are you repeating stupid rumors? You know very well that no one would give me such an order. And even if they did, I would be the first to tell you about it. You could have learned to trust me during all these years. Couldn't you? Oh, excuse my coming in this way, I thought there was nobody home. Ewa sent me for some clothes. The wardrobe in the hall... Which one can it be? Ah, this is the one. Some of the housemaid's stuff and Gabcia's clothes. Red skirt, sweater, yes, blue... It's interesting how all men react in such a stereotypical way when their manly pride is wounded. They immediately find some girl in order to show the world that they deserve it, they are still attractive. Who is she? What does she do? - I don't know. - Have you got any alcohol? Yes, I do have some. People say you drink a lot. She is quite cute but... You don't like her? I don't know what such girls are worth. Have you heard... She has quarrelled with him and she has quarrelled with her mother. This is the best moment - to... - No, no. You see, the time when I was trying to fight has passed. You don't even know what happened with me. I... Well, it's just gone now. I was looking at her during the trial, and, let me tell you, I didn't feel either love or regret. This probably had to happen this way. Are you sure you're not just telling yourself that? - Unfortunately, it might be so. - Why "unfortunately"? You see. You know that... Now it's... I miss Africa so badly, I keep dreaming about it. Here the weather is so undecided, I... I can't live in such an inconsistent climate. Excuse me. Jerzy, Ewa asked me to take the dog as well. Polo! You don't have the time to look after it anyway. Come, Polo, come now. Come on, come on, my dear. Gabcia likes it so much. Stay safe, bye. We're going home now. Right now. Ewa. Ewa. I'd like to talk to you, I'd like to explain. Actually, I wanted to apologize. Don't hang up. And how is Gabcia? I miss her, I'd like to drop by to see her. What are you doing here? I'm talking to you. Get out of here. Get out of here! You need to get out! Do you understand?! You need to get out of here! I don't want to see you here! It belongs to my dad! Get out! It is my dad's carpet! Get out! Get... out! Get...! Ola! What did you tell them at school? That you were sick. And if it turns out that I'm healthy? - It's not important. - Not important. - Has mom called you? - No. You mean you took your passport, took the ticket and you're here, don't you? I am. - Are you looking for something? - What? No, no, no. Dad, tell me how I can help you. I've talked to mom. Tomorrow we're going for a walk together. You have to talk to her seriously and explain everything. It can't be this way. Dad, tell me, if a person can't concentrate on one thing only, does it mean they're superficial? No, it may just as well mean that they're curious about everything. - And you? - What about me? Are you really that sad there? No, that isn't it. I just feel as if I was asleep and everything important in life was going on somewhere else. But I learned to be alone and that's important, isn't it? Well, very much so, it's just so that I could never achieve this much. Tell me how I can help you. You know, if it is really so hard for you there you can always come back, remember, but I think that some patience would not be out of place, would it? - It's hard to come back. - Certainly. You think that time stands still and waits for you, but when you come back you find out that there is no one to talk to here. For example Kaśka. We can't be friends any more. You always laughed at us and called us tattlers and gossipers. - Who am I to come back to? - Well, to us, to me. Mishka wanted me to buy him a pair of jeans. I will give you dollars, I still have some. Oh, no, God knows what he'll think. He saw me off at the airport, it was a major sacrifice on his part. You know, Kaśka tried to commit suicide in the seventh grade. It wasn't because of love. Stop it. - So you took the dog after all. - Yes, I'm sorry. Lidka called me, you know, our neighbour from downstairs. I'd given her mum's phone number, and she told me that Polo kept howling all day long. Anyway Gabcia also missed him very much and... Howling? Didn't she say anything about me? - No. - Ewa. Ola! Oleńka, be careful, she is still a small child, after all. - Did you notify Ola? - Me? No, why? - Who did it then? - I don't know. I thought it was you who wrote to her. - Are you mad? - Not yet. I didn't want her to find out until it was over. At her age and bearing in mind her extreme sensitivity to such matters. She has this peculiar tendency to exalt her own experiences. She takes after you, by the way. Fortunately, she is reasonable and independent. She takes after you, by the way. - How is Gabcia taking it? - What about Gabcia? Very well, why do you ask? Well, no reason. You can see that she looks very well. She's getting stronger, She's growing up. - Let's talk. - What about? You don't want to accept any of my proposals. Well, yes, yes. Have you found new work? Yes, I managed to find a position in the institute. You know that I have always wanted to work academically. Or at least try to. Well, now they helped me a little. - Who helped you? - Girls! Ola, we're going back! No, wait a moment, Ewa. We have to talk. We just have. Well, please, speak. Let's talk. Not like this. So how? I do have some rights. We should explain some things to each other. - You have no rights. - I think I do have some rights after all. Fortunately, I don't have to listen to your advice about what is good and what is bad. Naturally, you have a much better teacher now. Idiot. Do you think I'm jealous? That... Mom! She's riding on her own! For the first time. That I'm jealous? No, he simply disgusts me. I can understand that someone may fall in love, may be crazy about someone. But to be with someone like him... And who are you? A liberal, coffeehouse oppositionist. Who? Darling, what did you... What did you say? Cafe oppositionist... I'm taking Ola for diner to my mother's. She'll spend the night there and leave tomorrow. - I bought her a return ticket. - Do you think she will go? Obviously, she will. I just wanted to ask you not to make it any harder for her. What can I do? She is an independent girl. Yes, but I think that for her it will be... - Everything OK? - OK. - Are you coming with us to granny's? - I can't now, you know, I have an appointment. - But you should come. - Well, if I can't, I can't. So what am I to do? - Everything's going to be fine? - Fine. - Promise? - Promise. Goodbye, Gabcia. - Good morning, I have an appointment. - What's it about? It's personal. I've been calling you for two weeks. You told me to come today. Please, sit down. Mr Michałowski is here to see you. I see. Good morning, sir. Nice to meet you. Please, come in. - Excuse me, I thought... - Is anything wrong? - Excuse me, I thought... - I've wanted to meet you for a long time. So, how can I help you? - But I was supposed to see Broński. - Broński is on an extended sick leave. - When will he be back? - It's hard to say. Yes, hard to say. I'm filling in for him. Well, then, what's the matter? No, thank you, I guess I'll come later. And how is Ola doing? In Moscow? Well. Is she studying well? Are you satisfied? I am terribly grateful that you - arranged it then. - Don't mention it. - I came round to your office recently. - Well, it's no longer mine, I guess. Why didn't you let me know? Well, you see, I was boxing... I see. I see. I told you you'd be unpleasantly surprised. I underestimated you. - Knockout? - Oh no, no, no. It wasn't a unanimous decision. Three-two. Well, at least this much satisfaction. Certainly. Listen, I came to you on very specific business. - You probably have tails. - Tails? Yes, a tailcoat. Could you lend it me for a year? Well, what am I saying, "a year". Half a year. You see it all happened so fast that I won't have the time to have one made. I should have one somewhere, I haven't worn it for ages, I don't know if it's any good. Is it a decent place? Shit, wait, I haven't even unpacked yet. - Have you got it? - Yes, yes. Good post, a tourist resort. Well, it's OK. A bit too tight. - You can let it out. - Give it here, a little higher. A tailcoat should be a little tight. It's considered chic in the elegant world. If your tailcoat is a little too tight, it means you already had the time to wear it for a while and you're not a nouveau riche. Tell me where you're going. Oh, later. You'll read about it in the newspapers. You see, I'm still bickering with them a little, because, well... What else do I have left? Your health, ambassador. - Are you mad at me? - No, why? Well, I hurt your career after all, didn't I? I guess it was rather me who did it to you. They needed an excuse to transfer me. Well. - Fuck. - What? - Why fuck? - It all happened this way - without my contribution? - It often happens that way. Wait, excuse me. And what do you expect? Do you know the first rule of rotation? If someone is too good at what he does, he must be transferred. Well, for example when someone is an outstanding specialist in agriculture, they transfer him to sport, if someone is, let's say, good at sport, he ends up in education. And so on. And you have become too good. - You're terribly embittered. - Me? Not at all. Look. I'm relaxed. Do I look well in this? You know, I find it hard to accept this lack of all sense, of it having no meaning. My dear, my dear... It's a distortion straight from the communist youth organisation. Let me tell you something. You should start writing detective novels. Collecting stamps. Oh, buy a house in the country. Start working in the garden. Or learn foreign languages. Oh, well, you know them already... Listen, would you give me a few classes in French? You know, I can manage with English more or less, but French... Would you like to sleep with me, general? Do I have a good accent? Ah, it's you. I wanted to talk to you. You know, it's a bit difficult. Mom is asleep and so is Gabcia, the housemaid is in the kitchen. - Tomorrow maybe? - No, no, now. I beg you. Is it something important? - No... - So you see. Let's go to our place. I mean, my place. OK. It's the wrong key. Have you eaten? No, you know, I haven't been eating dinner recently. But go to the kitchen. Sit down. No, no, not here, there. You've prepared it very nicely. Where did I... - What are you looking for? - Matches, I don't know where they are. They're always here. Well. You haven't replaced the cooker? What? No. I forgot, I'm terribly nervous, I'm sorry. But it could blow up at any moment. You should take care of it. Well, a redecoration wouldn't be out of place here, you know. I don't think it makes much sense right now. - It will... - Well, anyway. I prepared it with plums, the way you like it. Pass me the plate. Wait, wait, one more plum. What big chunks. - Oh Jesus. - Do you like it? It's delicious. You know, recently we eat almost nothing at all because of mom's liver. Almost nothing in fact. - Some salad? - No, later. Why aren't you eating anything? - Well, you're right. - Eat, eat. - I would've forgotten. - Eat. The pieces are so big... I'm glad you like it. Some more? - Yes, just a plum. - OK. Oh, Jesus! Some wine? Look, it's so green. I didn't have the time to notice that it's the spring already. Well, generally it's quite cold. I'm freezing. - The climate is... - Do you remember when you came back from Ethiopia So chilled to the bone? You said then that the cold of the hot countries is the worst of all. Well, because it's true. Excuse me. Ewa. Ewa, where are you? Let's not make our lives more difficult. Are you crazy? The plaintiff Ewa Michałowska is present in court. On her behalf counsellor Jerzy Porębowicz. The defendant Jerzy Michałowski is present in court. On his behalf counsellor Joanna Cichoń. - Counsellor, I'm listening. - Yes, I support the action. - What is your position. - I move to dismiss the complaint in its entirety. Concerning the witnesses. I move to hear the witnesses indicated in the petition. - What is your position? - No objections. The court decided to hear the witnesses indicated in the petition. Please, call the first witness. Witness, please come forward. Please, please. Faster, closer. Approach the bench, please. - What does the witness know about the case? - Me? Well, yes, you. Once I could not sleep at night, I saw the light in the study and then I saw them, I mean the doctor and the gentleman here. In a, well, in an unambiguous position. What does the witness mean by an unambiguous position? So the gentleman was sitting in an armchair and the doctor above like... I did not look any more because I was afraid they could see me. - Counsellor? - Yes. Did what you see indicate intercourse between the defendant and the doctor? - What? - Intercourse. I guess so. The witness states in answer to the question of the plaintiff's counsellor, that she saw intercourse between the defendant and doctor... - Jakowicz Wanda. - Wanda Jakowicz. Excuse me, your honor, but witness did not testify that she saw intercourse between the defendant and the doctor. She testified that it seemed like that to her. Please, take down the testimony precisely. So how was it? Did you see the intercourse or not? Yes. So this is what has been taken down. Do you have any other questions, counsellor? No, thank you. Do you have any other questions, counsellor? - I do. - Go ahead. Was the plaintiff a friend of Dr Jakowicz? - Yes, they always... - Does it mean that the defendant cheated on his wife with her best friend? - Yes. - Thank you, thank you, I have no further questions. - When was... - It's your turn now. When did the situation you described take place? I don't know... Was it after the plaintiff moved out or before? - Well, he told me... - Who told you? Thank you. Are you sure it was after she moved out? - No, no, I guess before. - Before, before she moved out. It is thus clear that the defendant abused his wife's trust cheating on her with her best friend. The witness may leave. Call the next witness. - Madam... - You should address the court as your honor. Your honor, it's not true that the gentleman was bad to the lady. They lived together very well. I don't know, I, I, I worked for them for 15 years and it was always good. The old lady told me to... but I can't. God would punish me. The lady was also good, I can't complain. But the master was such a good person, he liked to tell a joke and gave gifts... Excuse me, did the witness receive many gifts from the defendant? He would always buy some things for the lady and the children, sir, I don't believe that the other lady - was important to the master. - What other lady? What other lady? Who does the witness mean? - Oh God... - When did the witness see another lady - and where? - I didn't see her, she was just passing to the bathroom. - I don't know anything. - When did you see her passing to the bathroom? When was it? - When was... - Well, when? Well, when, oh God, I can't remember anything. I was in a camp, they would hit me on the head. - Leave her alone. - I can't now. Just a moment, was Mrs Michałowska home at the time? Certainly not. No, she was not. And who was in the apartment? - When I came with Gabcia, - Yes. - There was the lady and the gentleman. - And what? Was this lady naked? - Oh Jesus and Mary, I don't know. - You mean she was naked, wasn't she? Well, when did you come with the child to the defendant, after you moved out of the apartment? It may have been so. So was it before you moved out or after? Well, so. Before, I guess. Before you moved out. Thank you, that will be all. Jesus, but I didn't... Please, don't ask any questions, she is afraid to say that she was at my place with the child. Please, don't ask her anything, - she is afraid of her. - But she can help us. No, she can't. - Thank you, I have no more questions. - The witness may go. Please, call the next witness. What can the witness tell us about the relations between the parties? Mr Michałowski is a rather bad-tempered man, maybe he could be more... - Balanced, right? - Right, oh yes, - balanced, exactly. - Well. Does the defendant abuse alcohol? One might call it abuse. Naturally, he shouldn't lose his temper, - but who of us, well... - Ah, yes. And what did you mean when you mentioned the defendant's violence? Well, one should respect other people's opinions, - shouldn't one? - Yes. Jerzy has recently, and it quite shocked me, beaten up a colleague, who had a different opinion about a book, which was to be awarded. They were both in the jury. Ah, and that was the reason for the beating, was it? - Well, yes. - Thank you very much. I have no questions. Were you present when the defendant hit his colleague? - No, I wasn't, but... - And do you know what the cause of their conflict was? This colleague showed everyone the bruises and told us what it was about. Well, Jerzy was not too sober then. I see and do you at least know who was involved? I overrule the question, it has no bearing on the matter. I wasn't authorized, it's true. Are there any other questions to the witness? No, thank you. Please, call the next witness. Witness Anna Łukasik, mother of the plaintiff. What does the witness know about the married life of the parties? First of all the defendant from the very beginning disregarded the work of my daughter. Well, but I didn't know him then. It was only when I learned that he attempted to rape my younger daughter. When did this happen and what does the witness know about it? Well, my daughter could tell you about it. One does not tell these details to one's mother. Well, why did your daughter leave her husband? I was ill then, - Well. - so my daughter moved in with me to look after me. Anyway, she would never leave her husband. Well, but later when she learned that during her absence my son-in-law was visited by other women - she decided not go back there again. - Does it mean that he made use of her absence and lived with other women when she was - looking after her sick mother? - Yes. Yes. Did the defendant buy gifts for his housemaid? Naturally, he bribed her to make her give him information. He also bribed the children but they still did not want - to see him. - Well. Do you think that the situation will worsen or improve in the case of divorce? - The situation of the children. - It will certainly improve. It will improve. So were there any other reasons for quarrels between your son-in-law and daughter? Naturally, very many. - Well... - Well. Any differences of opinion? Ah, well, yes, naturally, I would forget about it completely. Naturally, there were basic differences in political views. My son-in-law was two-faced. He would write one thing, and say something else completely at home which, naturally, had a very bad influence on the children. My daughter several times tried to talk to him about it. My son-in-law was always and everywhere thirsty for a new sensation. So the defendant questioned the official version of facts. - Did he? - Yes. And when did you learn that your son-in-law attempted to rape - your younger daughter? - Recently. Was it after your daughter left her husband? Well, I can't remember. In what circumstances did it happen then? Simple, my daughter told me. - Yes, but which one? - Both daughters told me. Both. Your testimony suggests that your attitude towards the defendant is extremely negative. Quite the contrary, I used to like him very much. - Thank you. - Are there no more questions? The witness may leave. Any motions? Thank you, I have no motions. Your honor, I move for the proceedings to be adjourned and for the sister of the plaintiff to be called as a witness. - Just a moment, the same move. - Please, don't do it. - But there is no reason not to, a moment. - I beg you. There is no reason to adjourn since the witness - is now in the building. - Please, call the witness. Your name. - Halina Łukasik. - Occupation? Student. - Age? - 22. - Your relation to the plaintiff? - I'm the plaintiff's sister. I must inform you that you have the right to refuse to testify. - Do you want to testify? - Yes, I do. The witness is obliged to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Perjury is punishable by law. Ewa wasn't in Warsaw at that time and the housemaid had a day off. The defendant called me, he said he had guests over, foreign journalists he had had to invite over for a drink. - I came then and prepared sandwiches. - But it's enough already. - After the guests left I went to - Quiet, please. - The kitchen, - Counsellor, - please, tell your client to calm down. - to wash up. - Go on, please. - Suddenly I felt the eyes of the defendant on me. I turned around, and I noticed that the defendant was standing in the doorway and staring at me in an odd manner. He came up to me, took a plate from my hands and started kissing me. I was shocked and dumbfounded. I wanted to break free, he caught my hands in a strong grip, led me to the living room and threw me on the couch. Shut up! But she's lying. Please, continue with your testimony. And it's only because I'm quite... fit... This is all. - Counsellor? - Thank you, I have no further questions. Counsellor? - I do have a question. - Yes? When did you tell your sister about the alleged rape? Only when she moved out. Why only then? I didn't want to worry her. Had you informed your mother about it at any time? No, my mother knows nothing about it. - She does not? - Counsellor. - Thank you. - Thank you, I have no further questions. - Counsellor. - Thank, I haven't got any questions. You may go, thank you. The court will hear the parties. I'm listening. I maintain the suit. Please, speak louder and faster. I meant to say that... I must get the divorce. The plaintiff maintains that the charges from the petition as true. Would you be so kind? What have you got to say? Jerzy. Excuse me! - Jurek! - Mrs Ewa. Your honor, I would like to apologise for my client, but your honor must see what this woman was driven to. It was an accident. It must've been an accident. He seldom left the apartment recently, he was writing all the time. I left only for a moment. I kept telling him that the gas heater in the bathroom was dangerous. I only left for a moment.
