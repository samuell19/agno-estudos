"...Christmas Eve of 1953 was a great day for the ''little fool'' Don Saverio Petrillo. " Here lies Maria Javarone Placed by the inconsolable widower on November 21st 1943 Lucky you! Lucky you! You knew him well, but now he's become even worse. Do you understand? PRAYERS IN LATIN - Rest in peace. - Amen. - Rest in peace. - Amen. PRAYERS IN LATIN - Your wife? - No. - Your sister-in-law? - Neither. - Your cousin? - No, she's a stranger to me. - So? - The late Mrs. Maria Javarone. - Javarone? - Yes. Don Carmine's wife? The guappo? The boss of the Sanita district! I'm a friend of his, in charge of saying prayers over his wife's grave. - He has no time for that. - His friend? I'm honored! Please give him my regards, he knows me. I'm Gennaro Esposito. Don't forget: I'm the salumiere, the salami maker. - My grocery store is the one in Santa Maria degli Angeli alle Croci. - OK, don't worry. - Best wishes, Madam. - The same to your wife. Sir, for the Child Jesus. Don Saverio, this is don Carmine's umbrella. You have to take it home. Saverio! - Is everything OK? - Yes. - How many tealight candles did you burn? - Four. See you later. - Saverio, you bought the baccala [dried cod fish]? - Yes, the baccala! - He doesn't even want to smell it! - Today, he will! You're telling me? I'd throw it in his face! My God! - You know, it's impossible. - It must be possible. Let's start with the baccala. The button, please. I can't take it any more! I can't take it any more! It's been ten years. Ten long years. Damned be the day he came into my house! It's your fault! You told him: ''Condolences, don Carmine". "Come visit us one of these evenings." That's what you told him. ''You must not stay alone tonight. '' "Please, honor us." That bastard has been honoring us for ten years! Does he have any right? Is he my father? Is he my brother, or my son? Who is he? What's his right? He's just a friend, an old school mate. Just because you were my school mate, you take my house... ...my table, my sons, my razor? He took everything from me, everything. Exploitative bastard, scoundrel! This time it must end. He must go away; I'm throwing him out, do you understand? What's going on? The children! - Well done, don Carmine! - Yes, he's great! - Dad! - There were three of them, one has run away. The other one got a slap and a fist on his chin. No, he slapped him four times! The taller one got two kicks in his belly.... ... and he banged against the wall! Three young boys that didn't pay me the proper respect. I always forget to take off my ring. Here you go! Excuse me. Excuse me. Is this a starched collar? Mrs. Carolina, I already told you I want them stiffer! - I used a lot of starch. - Use more, they're no good. I have to make a good impression, you should iron them again. - After all these years, you still haven't learned how to iron. - Sure, I should go to school! Holy Jesus! Let's have a light dinner tonight. I still haven't digested the seafood we had last night. What would you like to eat? Vegetables and some cod fillets. Do you have any walnuts? - Don't you agree? - Who, me? I didn't say anything. Hey! Vincenzino, Pasqualino! Be quiet, I have a headache! - Carmine, make them shut up. - Kids! - At your orders. - The ashtray. Here you go. Good night. Carolina. - I'm going out. - Have a good time at work. My good don Saverio! Don Carmine, we are honored to be received in your house. - The honor is all mine, come in. - Thank you. Saverio! The chairs. Thank you. - You can put your hats on. - Thank you. - Not you! - Please have a seat. We came here to talk about what just happened. - Don't talk about it! - If you will, we should talk about it just for a minute. - Please do. - Thank you, I'll be done right away. Giovannino came here to apologize in person. Gennarino and the Red are two good young fellows, they made a mistake... ...and you rightly made them understand. - They're crestfallen. They have realized their mistake and they want to apologize. - Apologize! - They want to kiss your hands. Do it for our old acquaintance. That's enough, let's go make peace. - Bring me my shoes. - Right away! - Well done! - You're our dearest friend. That's very worthy of you. Here he comes, finally! Didn't you know there's the opening of the salumeria [salami shop]? Here's your pasta. We're here. - You can start. - Thank you, Madam. Attention! Battalion! We've arrived at the master's! He's a nice man. He's the master of a hearty pasta, that fills your bowels and your belly. Attention! Battalion! Let's sing a nice song to the master! Come on! Cicerenella he had, he had, he had, he had.... Cicerenella he had, he had, he had.... Cicerenella had a rooster and mounted it all night long. How beautiful it was! That was the rooster of Cicerenella. Hello. Saverio, I'm going out to buy the walnuts. Give me a big slice. Children! This bread... Kids, this bread... Children! My God! What happened? - Are you hurt? - No! - Did they... - No! It happened all of a sudden. - I was at the bar with my friends. We were talking and eating. - And? All of a sudden I broke out in a cold sweat and I felt like I was dying. The Red gave me something to drink and it got even worse. - They carried me away to a pharmacy. - And then? I'm doomed! My heart... A.... heart attack! - Heart attack? - My life is hanging on a thread. - Hanging on a thread. - A little grief, a little excitement... ... and bye-bye! I was a king and now I'm so miserable. I didn't lack anything. I had respect, money, a home, a family... more than a family. Any excitement? I have to avoid any physical effort, loud noises.... Avoid physical efforts and loud noises! It's impossible here, with all this confusion and the children. Saverio, it'd be better to send the children to their aunt's. The medicine! I have to take one in the morning and one in the evening. We must be accurate, like a clock. What a nice life lies ahead of me! My God! That's it! I'm tired, get out of this house! Get out or I'll kill you! - Go and die somewhere else! - What? - This is my home! I want my life back, go away! Get out! Go away! Go away! Take this! And this! Out! Get out, you wretch! Take your collars with you! Go away! Carolina, did you see? I threw him out! He didn't say a word, that scoundrel! People! Tenants, come out! Look who's there! Don Carmine is going away! Saverio! Saverio, is it true? Yes, yes! Don Carmine, where are you going? We brought you the best doctor in Naples. - The best cardiologist. Shall we go to your house? - No. - We can do it here. - Very well. Professor, come with us. Get out. Carolina, I bought four big eels! They're still alive! Kids, come and take a look! Faster. That's enough. - Who diagnosed a heart attack? - A doctor. An animal! Your heart is made of iron and you have the body of a lion. - Are you serious? - You should only take a purgative. It's just common indigestion. - Swear it! - Take your hands off me, I swear. Be quiet! Sit down! Hurrah for pasta! - Dad, I'm first! - No, I am! - The eldest first. Here. Ready! Pay attention... get your glasses ready. One at a time! Fire! Cheers and Merry Christmas. Saverio, I'm bringing you some news: - Good news. - We don't want your news. All together against me. "...it was in the month of October that the Materdei district both suffered and enjoyed the emerald ring scandal. '' They're coming out, the function is over. Let me go! How long was the Mass? There was the blessing too. - Come out! Come and have your break! - Come on, people! Eat today and pay in eight days! - Come on! - Come on! Good morning, donna Sofia. Good morning, don Rosario. Give me a pizza. - That's a good start for today! - It's OK. It's hot! I need two, quick; I want to go to sleep. - Two pizzas for the night watchman. - Rosario! - Umberto Scognamiglio, one pizza. - Don Rosario! - Madam! - Will you give me two pizzas? - Right away. - Donna Sofia, how beautiful you are! - It's true! - You always think about that! - You have such reminders! - Cover yourself. - What? - Cover yourself! Rosario! Donna Concetta, two pizzas. - Good morning. - Don Peppino, how are you? - How's your wife? - She's doing bad, very bad! Poor Clara! - Give me this pizza. - Yes. - Here you are. - Bye. Don Peppino, don't despair: there's always hope. I think she will make it. Thank you. I hope the Madonna del Carmine.... ... can help her. - Two pizzas for Mr. Cutolo, Esquire. - No, he still has to pay for the last two months. [SONG IN NEAPOLITAN DIALECT] Donna Sofia, whenever I see you it's a sunny day! - What a beautiful sunny day! - Don Rosario, if you don't mind... ...I'd rather have donna Sofia make it. Don't make us waste our time, other people are waiting! Don Rosario, you won't let anyone closer, you always have your gun pointed. Where's the shovel? Behind the ''armoire''. Peace and all good. Peace and all good. Peace and all good. Peace and all good. Peace and all good. Where's your emerald ring? You had it when you went out this morning. When I came back I still had it, I swear! I must have lost it in a pizza while I was kneading. - My God! - Rosario! - Rosario. - Virgin Mary! - Rosario. - Jesus, Mary and Joseph! What are we going to do? - The ring! - If I had found it, I would have left already. Look in the dough, in the flour! Sofia, get dressed and come with me! Sofia! Bye. He's naked, don't go in. Don Vincenzo. - Don Vincenzo! - Who is it? Don Vincenzo, you're not sleeping. - Who are you? - You know who I am and what I want. You bought two of them! - Two what? - Pizzas! So what? I got married five years ago, on April 7th, 1949. I had saved some money and I wanted to open a pizzeria. I decided to give Sofia a ring instead, the most beautiful ring around here.... ... in the Stella district. This morning Sofia wore it on his finger, then it slipped into the dough... ...and then into some pizza! Don Vincenzo... ... in your pizzas! It's nothing! These are private matters, family matters. She lost her ring. - Virgin Mary! - He's crazy! You work all night long, then a good-for-nothing wakes you up! - Now I can't get my sleep any more! - He's right! He's a night watchman, poor fellow! - What do you want? - Get out of here! - Please! - Go away, have you got nothing else to do? - Move, let me breathe! - We're doing it for you. Excuse me. - Have you found a ring in your pizza? - No. The blessed sacrament! - Did you find it? - What's it to you? Did you find it? You want to come inside too? Just go away, please! - Oh, woe! - The Finizio's? - First floor. - We are in God's hands! - When did it happen? - Half an hour ago. - Did she die all of a sudden? No, she'd been sick for two years. There was nothing to do. Her husband is shattered, he's spent all he had. Let's go. Run over here, please! Come! What's up? Donna Sofia, did you hear? What a tragedy! - A family completely shattered! - Come quick, he wants to kill himself! Why? Why? Poor fellow! What a tragedy! Why? - Let me die! - Sure, that would be a great conclusion. What's left for me in this world? Clara! Clara, do you hear me? What's the point in living without you? Clara! Answer me! Speak! She woke up this morning. Suddenly, I saw her before me. She wore her night gown. She looked like a child. Clara, what are you doing? She wanted to make coffee for me - in her state! In her state! In her state.... In her state.... How can I still bear this face? How bad I was to her, poor woman! How many times she cried for me! - You good-for-nothing! - Don Peppino, what are you doing? Don Peppino, be brave, don't let it overcome you! The Cavaliere is right. You must be strong and use your pain to strengthen your soul. Do you want two adversities to happen at the same time? - Your mourning and a broken head? - He's right, what are you trying to do? PRAYERS IN LATIN Madam! So you heard? Oh, woe! A house in ruins, do you understand? What a tragedy, be strong! PRAYERS IN LATIN Thank you for coming! Don Peppino, be brave. Believe me. - She wants it too. - Yes? That blessed soul wants you to be at peace with yourself. - You must obey her. - I want to. Don Peppino, she's looking down at you from the sky above. Don Peppino. Everybody has his misfortunes. If you only knew what happened to me this morning! That's the reason why I came here. People who suffer can understand each other. This morning Sofia, in a pizza... Maybe your pizza. Maybe, mind you! It's true! The pizza! While Clara was dying, I was eating a pizza! Let me die! - I want to die! - Don Peppino! - I want to die! - No, don't do it. I want to die! Why won't you let me die? - I know, you want me to die slowly. - You won't die! Sit down. Come on, eat something. Tell him to. Eat something. Are you still here? Get out, move, please! - Did you find it? - What? - The ring. - The deceased's ring? No, not hers! Donna Sofia's ring. Don Alfredo, I beg your pardon, did you find a ring in your pizza? - I was right about to... - How lucky! Thank God, there are still gentlemen on this earth. - What an honest man. - As good as his looks. - He could have choked himself. - That's right. - Don Alfredo, I don't know how to thank you. - At your service. But there's no record here for your pizza. How's that? I got two. Ask your lady. Maybe I forgot to take a note. - You were looking for the coal shovel. - It's raining. Well done. - Thanks again, don Alfredo. - You're welcome. - Good morning. - Good morning, Sofia. - Good morning, Annamaria. - Good morning, Rosario, move! - Come out! Come and take a break! - Come on, people! Donna Sofia has your croissants ready! Come to the pizza king! Come on! - Have something to eat! - Come out! Come and take a break! A child has died in Naples. - Give it to me. - Don't worry. - I want to bring my son. - You can't. - Just for a while. - So? - Wait a moment. Teresina! Ah, Esquire. Well done. - I spent 300 lire. - Keep the change. - Thanks. The children. Children, keep in line. Just a moment, father! Let's go, father. Driver. - Let's go through the main street. - Very well. Maria, the sugared almonds. Di Costanzo! Back in line! Unbelievable! No more. Mom! - How many did you take? - One. - I found six. - I found eight. - Give me some. ".... the Count Prospero B. could not be considered a normal Neapolitan gentleman." - Have a nice walk, Count. - Thank you. - Lend me 10,000 lire. - The Countess will fire me! - I won't say anything. - You'd never be able to pay back 10,000 lire. Try to understand, you are ''prohibited''. - Proscribed, so what? - You can't make loans. - It's the law. - Think about it, I'll bring you back 30,000 lire. Maybe 50,000! I'm a good player. I can feel the cards, do you understand? I've got intuition and class, Giovanni. - No doubt about it. - The club members are afraid of me. When I show up, they just panic. There's the right fellow now: the baron of Altamura. I can easily win. Even 5,000 lire would be enough. The Countess won't allow it. This stupid proscription must end! The Countess won't live forever. She will die, trust me. But she keeps on fighting; she's taking some American medicine. Unfortunately, science is progressing! He's still here, Madam. I'm going for a walk. How are you? Giovanni! The silver salt shaker. Giovanni, I'm the man who's going to double your salary... ...on her funeral day. - Thank you, Excellency. All in all, a thousand lire would be enough. Only one thousand. I have a family, Sir. At least 500 lire! Federico, the Count! Hi, Federico. - Federico, get it ready. - Even today? Every day? Yes, whenever I want. Who's the boss here? Yesterday the Countess wasn't feeling good. Gennarino, the Count is waiting! Try to understand! Move! - I was having fun! - Do it for daddy. - Every day the same story. - Do it for daddy! - Good morning, Gennarino. - Good morning. - How are you? I'm warning you, today it won't be the same. Today I feel strong, very strong. So.... What are we betting? I'd say... Look! Do you like them? What are you betting? - The sling is OK. - No, I need it. Bet your picture cards. So, we play the scopa game, whoever scores 9 points, wins. Scopa. - How many points? - 4 deck points and a scopa [one point]. Shuffle. - What did you take? - A seven. It's ridiculous! Ridiculous! If I told it around.... Why are you laughing? What do you think you've accomplished? 4 and 5 from last round equals 9. Shuffle. My dear friend, the dumb win the first game! We bet stupid things anyway. I'll bet the whole building... ...from the cellars to the roof! Come on, score to 7 points. Are you ready? Yeah, yeah. Scopa. If I told it, nobody would believe it. - What a beautiful trick! - You're so lucky! - The card knows its master. - Right, Sir. Gennarino, you get on my nerves when you speak like that! - You're an ass! - Start again. I'm sorry, but try to understand! "The card knows its master!" I also bet my estate in Spalanise.... ...with the orchard, the vineyard... - The wood and everything else. Yes, let's do it. This is a serious game! Here you go, one scopa... ...and the prime. - Three points from the deck and one scopa. - 4 to 2. Shuffle. [FUNICULI' FUNICULA'] I want to make you broke, dear Baron. Your turn. You can't always have a 3 ready! Scopa! Damn! - You take the 3 and leave the card for a scopa? - You already played the King. I couldn't imagine you had all those Kings! Your luck is disgusting! It's a shame. - I know how to play. - Why, don't I? Mind what you say. Am I a wimp? Let's play. Let's play! - Scopa! - So what.... ...who do you think you are, you fool? You are not impressing me! I'm going to add my jacket... ...to the building and the estate! Come on! Admit it, you're just lucky! Say it! Admit it! You must say "I'm lucky''! - It's not true. - What? Admit it or it's going to end up bad! Gennarino, are you listening to me? I'm talking to you! Son, answer "yes", you're lucky. You always win! Don't get mad, he must have a saint on his side. He's got all of them! I've never seen such luck; it's disgusting! And it bothers me, how he's acting the teacher; he wants to give me lessons! - You're so arrogant! - Excellency, your jacket, your glasses. I've lost, they're all his. I'm a gentleman. - I pay my debts! - He's so lucky! ''... Teresa was that kind of woman. '' - Bye, Teresa! - Girls, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Get inside - do you want to get me in trouble? Teresa, I'll say goodbye here. My best wishes. Remember I cared for you a lot. Bye, Teresa! My best wishes! - Take this suitcase to Via Tommaso Caravita, 14. The Girasi's. - Yes. Have a seat. - What would you like? - Do you want anything? - No, thank you. - I'll have a corrected coffee. What can I tell you? I'd like to know something. Why did he leave me there until the last moment? What can I say? He's a nice man. He's been working for twenty years in the Girasi's company, I still remember when he was a child. He's a nice boy, maybe a little reserved. During these last days I felt like giving up. There are too many funny things. You insisted and everything was ready, the banns were already published. But when he comes, I'm going to speak frankly to him. He wants to marry me and lets me keep doing what I always did? He could find me a place in a hotel, in a boarding house. He's got enough money. I know, I asked around. This marriage will be of great advantage to me. A friend of mine chose a one-legged man just to get married. But a girl, whoever she is, has to be sure. - Don't you trust me? - I don't know. He never showed up, I've been speaking to you alone since the beginning. - It seems like we are the ones getting married! - I gave you the pictures. Yes, sure! I don't trust any picture. Are you starting with that talk again? Sure, I'll be his wife soon. - I have the right to ask some questions. - Yes, but what matters is he's marring you. Sure, he's marrying me... Why? Why does a man want to get married? You're not a child any more. Drink a little anisette. Here comes don Nicolino. I recognized you right away when you came in. Shall we have a seat? Don Nicolino. I'm sorry I'm late. It doesn't matter, don Ubaldo and I had a little chat. This dress suits you perfectly. I'm so dumb! This stain won't go away. Don't worry about it. It's all in the family, friends and relatives. - Maybe we can start being less formal with each other. - Right! One day I came by your shop to take a look at you. I didn't get inside, you were at the counter. You liar! Did you hear? I didn't know anything about it. When he came to talk to me, the first time... ...he told me you saw me walking by in the street. Yes. In Piazza Dante. - In Piazza Dante. - So you followed me! Sure. Excuse me, it wouldn't be polite to make our guests wait. Waiter! Try your ring. It looks nice on me. Let me see yours. - Congratulations! - Cheers to the bride and groom! Everything's OK, don Nicola, everything's in order. I'm the accountant for the Girasi company. Pleased to meet you. I'll introduce you to Don Nicola's aunt and uncle. You're late, but the priest is very nice. The uncle enters with the bride, the aunt with the groom. Let them through! - Is everything alright? - Yes. The bride and the groom are coming. Kids... Assuntina! - Right away! - The bride and the groom are coming. Later the buffet! The bride and the groom are coming. - Can I have an orange juice? - Later! Maestro, are we ready? Good morning. Congratulations again! Best wishes and all happiness! - Is mom sleeping? - Maybe not. Everything's alright, don Nicola. Please, make sure the coats are taken care of. Nicola. Did you tell her... about me? No, don't think about it. Come in. Mom. Mom. This is Teresa. My blessed child! My blessed child! Can I keep you company for a while? No, mom, we're celebrating now. We'll come back later. - Did you get some rest? - Yes, a little. We'll come back later. My blessed child! She's a nice old woman. She has more jewels than the Madonna of Loreto. - This is the bedroom, do you want to freshen up a little? - Yes. - Here's the bride. - Please, Madam! Bravo! Did you like it? - We were wondering where the bride went. - You're so beautiful! - Best wishes, again! Let me make a special wish. - Where's don Nicola? - Where has he gone? You must always stay together. - Excuse me. - Please. Everybody's asking about don Nicola, where is he? I'm going to call him. Just a moment. - Excuse me. - The buffet is delicious. Congratulations, Madam. It's wonderful. Excuse me. Excuse me. Don Nicola! No, don Nicola, never mind. I know this won't be of any comfort.... ...but do it for me, take them. It's just as right... ...as everything else happening today. Don Nicola, Teresa's here! We're leaving, thank you again. - Are they relatives of yours? - Relatives? Yes, relatives. - They were crying. - Out of joy! Today there's both laughing and crying: it's the same thing! Sir, please move a little, you're hiding the groom. Please, move this way. - Am I looking good? - Perfect, Madam. - You move further to the center. - Kids, let me through. - Do you want to keep the bride and groom apart on their wedding day? - No! I'm curious about the way you met each other. - In the street... - Are you ready? Be still! Closer to each other, smile.... So? It's destiny! He was driving his car, I was visiting Naples. He almost ran me over! Then he braked... you know how these things are. - All in all, it was very nice. - Sure, it was very nice! Your attention, please! In honor of this beautiful bride from Rome, a song from Rome too! How beautiful you are, Rome... - Is it a death song? - Sing something cheerful. - The one about the wine.... - "Nanni." - Yes, ''Nanni''! - Play! You see, that's Marino, there's a grapes festival. Fountains spilling wine, there's such copiousness! Downhill you see Genzano and the picturesque Albano. Let's go have fun, Nanni, Nanni! What's that girl to you? Her name was Lucia. One year ago she killed herself because of me. She was a good and sincere creature, she loved me very much. She used to wait for me when I went out in the morning and when I came back in the evening. She tried to explain her love to me, as a young girl will at her age. But I didn't listen to her; I had friends and women! Sure.... ...you're young. One day she appeared trembling in front of me. She was crying. She said... ..."Bring me peace, don Nicola, help me! '' I started laughing. "I have no intention of getting married", I told her. "You've been badly informed, my sweet Lucia. " Actually I told her something more... "I'm not as rich as you think, I'm the owner of four small shops only.... '' ''... and two of them are not profitable. '' She didn't say anything - she went home and killed herself. I must atone! What for? Did you care for her? Did you deceive her? Why are you torturing yourself, then? Poor child! You didn't tell her to go crazy and do what she did. - You cannot understand. - Why wouldn't I be able to? You couldn't imagine she would kill herself. Shut up! I must pay, all my life. I told her parents too, I must pay for what I've done. I must suffer for the pain I caused her, that's why I married you. Why would I make you suffer? I just want to live in peace. You too... you have everything! - Let's live in peace. - Teresa, let's make it clear. Maybe you got the wrong idea. I won't be anything to you, ever. For the others, I'll be your husband. Little by little, everyone in Naples... The entire city must know who my wife really is. - Hey! - Everyone must know who I married! - What are you saying? - I promised the Virgin Mary. I'm Lucia's husband, forever. - So what am I doing here? - It seems clear to me, what did you think? It suits you too, we made a deal. I pay my debt and you can advance in society. Hey! What do you think? Marriage is a serious matter! - Am I not a woman too? - I'm sorry, the talking is over. Leave me alone. Come here! Sleep wherever you want, who cares? What kind of reasoning is that? - Are you crazy? - You should have understood. What? I asked Ubaldo to pick any woman, it didn't matter. So it's not true that you saw me.: : ...and you liked me! You and that.... That pimp! You tricked me! It's just a trick. But you're the mistress here, more than anybody else, more than my mother. Take it. These are the keys. I can open a bank account in your name, I can register one of my shops in your name. Good night. - If you leave, I'll scream. - Be reasonable. - What's there to reason about? This is no way to behave. You can't treat a person like this! It's not right. But I... I'll put you to shame! I'll tell everybody! Everybody! That's right, everyone must know. Open it! Open it! You'll regret this! Just my luck to meet this scoundrel! Hey! I'll go back to where I lived and I'll write ''Mrs. Girasi" on the door! Scoundrel! Scoundrel! - Madam. - He's a good-for-nothing! You'll remember me, you scoundrel! You'll see! Why did it have to happen to me? What am I going to tell the others? What am I going to say? What can I say? What an awful situation! What a situation! Damn you! You can't behave like that! You can't behave like that! You useless scoundrel! How do you get out of this disgusting house? ''... don Ersilio Miccio used to sell wisdom. '' You take ten, twelve cloves of garlic and squash them.... ...then you put them under your armpit. You'll burn with high fever. You must be kidding, don Ersilio! I want to stay with my girlfriend; how can I stink of garlic? My son, you want to extend your leave and still smell like a rose? You can't have everything. Don Ersilio, should we still wait? Just a moment! You can go now, I told you what I know. Garlic! Your girlfriend will have to bear it. Put your fee over there. Garlic! Damn! We just finished the Tabernacle of the Virgin Mary. - That's great! - It's beautiful. They placed 50 such big lamps around her face. There should be a special epigraph, you should come up with something. Yes, I'll think about it. Since it relates to the Virgin Mary.... "You wanderer passing by, look up and to Mary say hi. '' No, those are old words, I don't like it. - I must think of something better. - Don't ask for a high fee. No, I'm cheap. 300 lire, but I need some time to think about it. - Please go, there are other people waiting. - You're right. Take care. An eternal epitaph. - Wait, I was here first! - No way, I was. - Who's first? - I am. - Come forward. - Don Ersilio, what should I do? - What are you thinking about? My son! This was customary in the old days of Ferdinando II. You're out of time, I'm sorry. There are other ways now... ...you can use words as a weapon, reasoning and contempt. Maybe a handful of slaps, but never this far... Anyway, if that's your decision... But it's a criminal act, you need 700 lire. Make the sign of the Cross and put 200 lire over there. A scar is a serious matter. - You could end up in jail for years. - That's why I came to see you. Listen to me, then. You take your razor to the shop to have it sharpened, don't keep it in your pocket. You keep it in a newspaper. By chance you meet this fellow. He laughs at you... ...you get mad and you hit him.... ...forgetting you had your razor in your hand. You get it? There's no premeditation, you might get three months on probation. - What if the guy doesn't laugh? - He won't. - But your witnesses will swear to the contrary. - Where can I find them? Kid! Your naivety is so sweet. In court there are witnesses all over the place. I understand! Thank you. You're welcome. - Excuse me, it's my turn! - I was here first! - It's my turn! - I was here before you! You're wrong, it's my turn. Shut up! You're driving me nuts. - You're so pushy! - Miss Maria, please be quiet. - Don Ersilio! - What is it? I beg your pardon, but it's something of general interest. - It regards the collectivity, which means everybody. - He knows! - So? - The duke, it's always him! - Always. - Come and take a look. The duke! Inside, get inside! How should I tell you? Inside! You and your furniture, go inside! Is it possible you're always standing in the way? Go away! The car must turn! Inside! Alfredo was about to break a dish in the duke's face. I stopped him and told him to come and see you. He deserved a dish in his face! He's a duke and we respect him, he owns an entire building. - But when he wants to drive his car through, once a day... - Twice. Yes. When he drives his car through, twice a day.... ...he wants nobody in his way. He doesn't even wait for us to move. We have no room inside, not even to sleep. Where is Gennarino going to polish his furniture? Where can I eat my meals with my children? - It cannot end like this. - Pasqualino, what are you up to? The duke has succeeded in having an ordinance issued. It reads "It is forbidden"! He's leaving. - Damn! - What are you doing? Sit down. When did you come in? What are you looking for? Nothing, I was just watching. I brought you the oranges. - Well done, these are very good. - I'm going to burn his building down! Don't over-react, We can send him to the hospital. - We can spread some soap in front of the entrance. - It's not enough. - It's not enough? - Do you want him dead? - Worse than that! - Worse? - A "pernacchio". - A raspberry? A raspberry raspberry? My son, raspberries are not all the same. The real pernacchio doesn't even exist anymore. Nowadays you might hear a "pernacchia", but it's rude and ugly. The classic raspberry is an art. There are... Pasqualino, Vincenzo... There are still three or four people who know it deeply.... ...and perform it all over Naples, which means all over the world. The raspberry may be done in two different ways, using your head or using your breast. In this case it must be done using both your head and your breast... ... which means brains and passion. The raspberry we are going to blow at the duke must have this meaning.... ..."You are the lousiest of the lousiest of the lousiest of men. '' Great! What's the duke's name? - Duca... - Santa Maria degli Angeli. - No! - Duca... Sant'Agata dei Fornai. Wait! Alfonso Maria di Sant'Agata dei Fornai. No, you must say it together using the same pitch. - All together? - Yes. Duca Alfonso Maria di Sant'Agata dei Fornai! My God! You should perform it twice a day, when he goes out and when he returns. Do you understand? Please... Use a soft hand. It must be like this... soft, delicate. Your lips a little wet. Your fingers up, otherwise it would make a meaningless noise.... .... and it wouldn't have the same effect. While the raspberry I showed you before.... ...can start a revolution. Come.... - That's enough; it's late. - Good night! Don Ersilio advised us to blow a raspberry at the duke. You lift your finger and blow a raspberry. Good night. Very good, and practice! Don Ersilio, look at this beauty! - Beautiful! - "You wanderer passing this way.... '' ''... look at Mary and say a prayer. '' It's worse than mine! It won't do. Good night. - You didn't tell me who the fellow is. - That's my business. I have to know both the sin and the sinner. - It's my girlfriend. - Your real girlfriend? And you're getting married? Yes. You want to scar the face of a girl.... ...that you'll keep with you for the rest your life? - Don Ersilio, that's my business. - Enough, who's the girl? Nunziatina. - Nunziatina, The barber's daughter? - Yes. - Doesn't she love you? - She says she does. - So? - She won't give me a real love's proof, do you understand? The great love's proof. Kid! She won't give you the great proof. The proof.... she just won't. Remember, first you have to get married. She won't give up, she came to me, and I advised her so. Be careful, you'll end up getting ten years. Duca Alfonso Maria di Sant'Agata dei Fornai! - Good night, don Ersilio. - Good night.
