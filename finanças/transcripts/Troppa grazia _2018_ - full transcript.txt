We just can believe everything. We still believe in Santa Claus! An old alcoholic who walks by with a bunch of stolen reindeer. Does Lucia work? - What are you doing? - I'm a topographer. It's just a job, nothing special. Anyone can do it. Because say that anyone can do it? Because it's ... easy. And Lucia does not think she's crazy? Well, I ... I'm meticulous, it's my specialty. But... even now, the way How I behave at work? It's not good, it's not responsible. very demanding of herself? Yes, I hate people who do not. Why? How bad is that? Ter human having defects. Yes, it can be human, but people take advantage. I Think... we must always give our best. Or at least we should try. Are you sure?

To be honest, early to say. What does it mean for you to be crazy? Let's say that seeing the Virgin Mary It's a good start. I'm here. Yes, I see. Did you go to the men? I did not have much time, I swear. Stop us and tell them to build a church ... No. - No? - No! I will not do that. I do not build churches. Am sorry. You have to do as I say, Is important I said no.

"Now we live in Claudia's house?" - Why? Do not you like her? I thought we had our house! And we have our house. Do not worry. Why do not we go home? Why? - Tell me why we're not going home. - Why? Because... Because we have problems with the electrical installation. It's really dangerous, short-circuit. It happened once when I was young, in the house where I grew up. Very dangerous! I do not want you to die electrocuted. I may even die, but I do not want it to happen to you. This time we were in danger, do you understand The Av , Av , I ... It's only half an hour. We greet Paolo and we bowed. Here they are! This is Lucia Ravi, the topographer, and our press officer, to Claudia Manfredini, already know her. The architect Serra, the creator of Onda. Much like it. I like it when time changes like this, suddenly. The idea of ​​the movement ... beautiful! Lucia? Was it born and raised here? Yes. Excuse me... Why? What? You know.

Yes, you have had some visions ... - Visions? - It happens to everybody. She sees things, it happens to me a lot! - What's wrong with her? - She's going to Our Lady! - Are you okay? - I do not understand. Lucia goes to Our Lady and talk to her, you know? - That's what they say? - Most of the time, they argue. Our Lady tells her to build a church in the field, Lucia says, of course, that neither think, the other insists, is irritated, You know how Lucia is ... - What field? - The field! Which? The terrain of Onda. Paolo, I'm sorry ... - Very well! "Thank you, Ermes. Why did you choose Lucia? for this service? Can you tell me? There should be about 40 topographical in the city. Why her? Because she's a miser. It was the only one I could sign without causing me problems. So there's trouble, she's right ... It's full of problems! Look around, problems everywhere! Is it a question of corruption? I'm sorry, Paolo, but now he liked to know. Corruption ... Corruption? We are corruption! I, you, the people who live here ... Look, those people over there, they are corrupt. If we did things well, we would all be imprisoned for corruption. First the old men, then the children. No ... let's start with the children. Corrupt from birth, Let's get them too. We reviewed the daycare centers, preventive prisons We close them all and throw away the key! Corruption ... The alternative... Let's not mess around, we do nothing, and die. Look who's here! Hello, my dear. Ready... Do you want a ch ? You always did this ...! I see her, she talks to me, I talk to her...

My little problem with the hero. Yes I know. - Then I passed him. - I know I know! I could not be more healthy! - Why do not you play again? - Good ... Why? Because when I played ... How many people were watching? Fifty people? Seventy on a good night! Then later, when I decided to stop, slowly... people started to follow me on Facebook. Do you know how many followers I have now? I have 65 000! I got 65,000, you know? You? It pays more not to touch. - Okay, I'll walk. - Bye. What the fuck is that of Our Lady? Ol , Arturo, how are you? I'm well thanks.

How much do you earn? - What? - How much do you make? - I do not understand. - With this story. That of Our Lady will to build a church in Onda. - How much do you get out of it? - I won nothing. Please... - Anything. - Then why do you do it? Because I see it! - Are you going to Our Lady? - Our Lady, this one. As in Ftima? The cave, the shepherds, how are they? I'm one of the little shepherds. If you wanted me to come back, just a Whatsapp. "And I sent it?" - Not really ... - How's Rosa doing? - It's fine. - Are you still fighting? - Yes. - Good at it. - I think so, too. Last year, television passed the Olympic Games. I always saw the fencing, because it was like seeing her. Me too. Do you want us to react? Arturo, I told you that I see Our Lady. So what? That does not stop us from reacting. Listen ... My life now ... - You have no idea. - And mine? Explain what you mean the ray of Our Lady! I see it, we talk, we discuss ... And she knocks me. Have you looked for someone? An exorcist or something? No, an exorcist no. I went to a psychiatrist. - A psychiatrist is even better. - Yes, I do too. And what did he say? - How are you? - I am... I'm good, apart from my question. with the aliens in the shipyard. What do you have against foreigners? To begin, I do not understand what they say. They are always making a little party. with each other, there is no real integration. They say that they have courses and speak languages, they say that I rob them of their work, are obsessed with it. And now that I've got something, specialized work, not a thing for people without training, but for experts like me, l at the shipyard, this question arises from Our Lady! Is it my fault? Sorry, I'm so sorry ... But it was soon to be there ?! Arturo, I'm afraid I'm going crazy. And if I go crazy, they take me to Rosa. And they would do very well. But I'm sure This is going to happen. You have me, too. I returned. Keep calm You and Rosa, and you see ... everything will work out. Did you miss me? I'll always miss you. Bye! "I want to share with you," "this wonderful thing what happened to my daughter Lucia. " "Our Lady appeared to Lucia, they speak." "I'm not joking, It's even an apparition. " "After years of silence, I feel renewed energy. " "Publish" Lucia ... Sign this. - What? - The pushing. It was Fabio who did. - You copied the map of 2011! - I know, you would have done better. Not at all, it was starting to look ridiculous. Please sign. Thank you. Bye! You guys are some shit. Do you know how many people Were you expecting this? Many? People like us. People who live here, who wants to improve his life. How bad is trying to be happier? None. Why? Because I want to live, okay? I want to see s ries on TV with Rosa at night, I want to talk about wine, the fruity taste that is on the palate, whether mbar or metallic ... Because... I want to have a book of Buddhism on the bedside table and never open it. And then I want to go eat fries, I want... I do not want to catch a glimpse! Because of it Tell me what's going on. Problems should not be ignored. They must be faced. The only person who runs away to your problems You're not telling me the truth. My God! The truth is we have problems. of electricity and that dangerous. Arturo was right. - What do you mean? - He did good to leave you. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Stupid! This is our beautiful unity. of intervention in the crisis. - The press? - It's two or three. Three local newspapers that knew and they want an interview. But nothing critical, nothing very important. I will make a point of the situation: Our Lady says that we can not build here, and that's a good news. Because I know from my own experience how's this going to end? It will end a conversation. type "Progress against Nature", how we became bad, that before that was everyone was happier, the babies were born at home, etc, etc ... I do not anticipate a positive outcome. Above all, because Our Lady ... as I have to agree, has a large number of followers. Not only here, but all over the world. Therefore... - Paolo? - Yes? Maybe you should tell your collaborator, to Lucia Ravi, whereas the instruments to which we have access today they're a little more sophisticated than those that existed in the time of the good Jesus! Oxal could deal with him. I think he would be much more profitable than the mother. We will get conquer it too. Paolo, there's nothing there, I assure you. There's a joke ... Seriously, it's really funny ... Seriously, that's a joke. Stop us! As? You to You? You can not be here, We started the work already. Tell her! Who do you think you are? You know how to say "Go to men" and I will go, Let me do this! You say that on this earth Can you build a church? It's okay, I'm going! Good Morning. Good morning everyone. Listen, I do not want to cause problems. I swear I hate trouble. But the survey of quotas that I did differs too much of the previous maps. And that means ... what's up, anything with this terrain. - Anything? - Something, I do not know what. But there is something that is not right. Alright ... Let's stop being around. Everybody knows. Admit it. I can see Our Lady. I talk to her, we argue, I see her. Said that, I understand that it is difficult to go there, but the technical data are the technical data. And it was not she who created them, it was I, I swear. What's the matter with these grounds, Lucia? I do not know. I only did a survey of quotas, but here is an anomaly. I... I feel it. Do you feel it? - It says "water." - What does that mean? Why water? - Say. - I say water? I say! Water Water Water Water Water Water Lucia? Is she here? Where exactly? How fascinating! No ... Sorry. Lucia ... Arthur ... What are you doing here? I was sleeping. Why do not you go home? Because I have no home, I subjugated it.

Sleeps. Lucia, tell yourself that everyone treated you like crazy today? Do you realize that? I do not want to argue ... but they were not ... completely cheated. No, they were right. - Were they right? - Yes. So you realize ...? If you go mad, you'll get Rosa. - You told me. - Shut up. French fries! - M e ... - French fries! An! No! An! I already ate it! What is this? Good things should be shared with everyone. We have talked about it many times, Remember? We agreed that everything, less potato chips. Indeed, after careful consideration, we combined the french fries ... Remember? I had already forgotten ... You can not fry the potatoes. at the same level as ... Other things to share. Go get the mayonnaise. - Right. - She remembers. And it brings water. You're ruining everything because of this. You risk losing everything. What do you want to do? I do not know ... What do you feel? Something is not right. Where in the universe? There is something, and I do not know why, but it has to do with me. - It has to do with us? - No, no ... Her To Our Lady! - I 'm not her ... - . - Let go, lady. Help-me! "Please, let me touch you." No, no! - Are they nuts? - They're just praying. - Exactly! - Ready... - Sit down a little. - Yes. Ol . Calm... - How are you, Lucia? - So what? What's up? When we started digging, we had to use the bombs, of course, and our only option was to use the conduits for drainage, only the last maintenance was made in 1978. The bombs could not handle and the water began to overflow everywhere. I say this without irony, believe me! But it was not a miracle. It was just a problem with sewers. We're still waiting for a miracle. and we expect it to arise, for the next one. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, my God, yes! Thanks. It's not a miracle. Do you understand? It's not a miracle. It was just the sewers. You go home, my lady. It's not a miracle! Just the sewers, they're just the sewers! Go home. You go home, too. Thank you! Look. Look around. Look around you. This ... your church. This... You Can? - Is anyone here? - V l ... I just wanted to make sure. Why did you turn everything off? "I did not want to see you again." - What the hell...?
