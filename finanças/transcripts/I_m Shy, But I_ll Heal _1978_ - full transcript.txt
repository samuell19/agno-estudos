We met in 1968. Under the influence of the sexual liberty, which rushed upon France, I continued to do courtship to Huguette M. Dark-haired, erudite, charming and moreover... living in the flat B on the sixth floor. Yes? I love you. In May you are allowed everything. I must confess that in the following 10 years... my relationship with Huguette never reached the intensity of a torrid love. - Yes? - I love you. In May 1978... we were celebrating 10 years of life together with Huguette. - Yes? - Huguette, I love you! Come in. - Right now? - Yes. I can come back later if you want, because I... I am waiting for you... sixth floor, flat B. Please. You first. - Come on. - Yes! - On the sixth floor, isn't it? - Yes. He loves you. I have heard everything. - I saw him! I saw him! - But... but it isn't true! I'M SHY... BUT I'LL HEAL The moral of my adventure with Huguette it was clear. I wasn't built for an intense lovelife. Since my shyness prevents me from becoming a Casanova... at least I will become a good cashier. Yes! Right away! I have resigned myself to the idea of spending my life between TVA and tip. Miss, please! On December 17th, at 17:30 the acrimonious destiny... have played once again with my good intentions. From some minor details, I understood... that I was the victim of a first sight love. - Mr. Renault? - Yes. To whom belong this beauty? To you! After six months, if you want. Not this one, she is one of my fiancee. But she is beauty as well. Did you have cut our announcement from the newspaper regarding the shyness? Yes, I did. Well, I am the spokesman of I.A.P. The Institute for Advanced Psychology. Come in! Take a seat! Since 1796... our institute is proud of curing two millions of people. Let me present you randomly few cases of cured timidity. Stendhal, unable to greets his host... months later he wrote "Red and Black". Bravo! Two colors which don't fit together at all. Robespierre, in 1788, didn't dare toinvite his cousin to dance. In 1790 he establishes the terror and decapitated 120,000 people. Good achievement, isn't it? Bonaparte, dominated by his mother... everybody went through this situation... after few years of practicing he fought against whole Europe. No! Closer to our time... Please... Closer to our time... a house painter didn't dare to ask for an increase of his salary... but once cured, I did the biggest genocide... and have passed to history by the name of Adolf Hitler. And recently, Raoul B. engineer at Mout-de-Marson, who suffered many years due to a forced bachelor life. He set into the limelight becoming the director of an Alcazar's magazine. - An engineer? - Indeed. Due to Cugnot, Flemming, Landru. Paul VI-th and Eddy Mercks... No... it is... Personally I prefer Felice Gimondi. Gimondi? These examples are impartial witnesses to prove to you... that everything is possible. And for you it is possible to share a great destiny. The drama of timidity, Mr. Renault, let me tell you... cut the wings of ambition. It is true. So... What scares you the most: To encounter a dead body? To kill an insect? Or to be invited to a party? For me, is the dead body. No, to be invited to a party. As you wish. A dead rat? A ghost? - A policeman? - A policeman. Here we agree. The emotional style: 9.18 Interesting. Every evening you will listen for half an hour of PSI relaxation... from the tape no.1. Every morning you will listen practical advice from the tape no.2... advice which you may find pictured in this book. But I don't have a tape-recorder... Look! I will give these products which we sell and which will help you... to develop you natural borne aggresivity. Position of aggresivity... In every day life you need to defend yourself. And that it's ! You see... Sounds great! With all these, within six months, we guarantee an improvement upon your timidity. Sax months? Too much. I was thinking that during you are practicing you could also get a tan. This will add more trust to your unrewarded psychology. Here it is! - Mr. Renault, thank you. - Goodbye. Goodbye and thank you! In order to posses all the advantages... you have some money, about 20 francs. I can give you a rabbit paw which my grandmother gave me. This has saved me many time from troubles. Sounds good! Are you interested in a Citroen break in good condition ? I don't have driving license. What a pity, it is a good bargain. I would have been delighted to help you out. I am the voice, I am your friend. From now on you will not be alone anymore in the world which so much scares you. From now on you will trust... 698, 699... 700... I said 700! Damn! Two minutes break and we start over again. Imagine that your are in the center of the Universe... everything gravitates around you... the planets spin around you, the stars... Every thing gravitates around you. The planets... Stendhal has been cured. Napoleon has been cured... and even myself was feeling better. Miss, are you satisfied of the vacation in Vichy ? Delighted! And now the hotel Negresco, Nisa. It is indeed a pleasant life. Goodbye, Miss. Stop! To Nisa. I said stop! Stop! To Nisa! I said stop! I go to Nisa... We didn't arrive at Nisa yet! It is nice! It is pretty... Don't worry. It scares because it is big... but in reality, it is small like a little child. - Do you want some? - No, thank you, I am not hungry. No! How pretty. Take this! Say "Thank you" to mister. How nice. Listen to your mother. He took me another piece. - He doesn't understand! - Kid! Did you finish? Did you stop? Stop it! Kid, you are nut! Stop it! In this way he shows his tenderness? Is this tenderness? - So, shall we make the stop? - Yes. You search the adventure, isn't it? With your eyes your are such a heartbreak. - Please... - Don't foul around, I have enough experience! I know very well what the men are looking for! All men are the same. No, Mrs. I go to Nisa. We didn't arrive yet... Sweltine - the yogurt which makes you thin waist. I know a trick which makes you an even thinner waist... - It is nap time. - But I am not tired. You will be soon. Come on, get in! But there is no need for this. Kid, do you hear me? You hear me? Mr. doesn't want to get in. Do you help me ? Help me ! Push! But... Push, Kid! Push! No! Leave me alone! Let me go! Damn it! My hands! My hands! O, Agnes... The road on which I come to you is already full of dirty. But how could I have convinced her the woman with a tender smile... that I couldn’t abandon me for a night... as long as my heart beats for somebody else ? Set in the track which was carrying me I was preparing to meet Agnes again... and I didn't doubt about the strength of the love... balanced by the negligence of the destiny. - Where are you going? - To my flat. Sorry? With the manager, please... Cashier? Are you kidding ? - Dishwasher, if you want. - Dishwasher ? Are you kidding ? That straight way which was getting me to Agnes... was about to make an expected tum. Even Napoleon, before fighting against whole Europe... didn't he stagnate in the kitchen? Not like this! The rhythm is the most important! Look a little bit. I take the dish, I wash the dish, I throw the dish, I catch the dish. I dry the dish, I wipe the dish, I put the dish. And... I take the dish, I wash the dish I throw the dish, I catch the dish, I dry the dish, I wipe the dish I put the dish. Come here! You and I... Three, four... And... I take the dish, I wash the dish, I throw the dish, I catch the dish. I dry the dish, I wipe the dish, I put the dish. Do you know this game? I wash one side, then I wipe the other side I am outside! Since my a arrival... I found the best way to watch Agnes surreptitiously. During my break hours. Obvious, sawing her so beauty, and moreover, so alone, I felt my vanity flattered, but it was risky for my health. Now when you gained a little selfconfidance... we can start the first exercise. I am sure that you have difficulties when asking for certain products in shops. Think at that one which gives you the biggest problems. Now, that we have identified, repeat after me. I am all right, I am calm and revigorated. I am all right, I am calm and revigorated. - Two underpants... - I am not the seller. - Miss. Irene! - Yes? No, there is no need to... - Sir? Do you need something? - Two shirts, please. Leave it, don't bother. - Beautiful, aren't they? - Yes, yes... They are not your size. No, they are my size: 42. - No, your size is 44. - These fit me even better. Really? Go into the cabin and test them There... - It's all right ? - Yes. They fit me well. - Are you hurt ? - No, no... I am fine. Sir, it is better to buy size 42. No, I can wear it like this. They seem... you see? You see... they are. All right. I will put them together with the shirts. I keep wearing them. I would like two underpants... I have enough shirts... no, no, no... I would like two shirts quickly, two underpants. Size 42. Good morning, Mrs. Two underpants, quickly. What? We are men, can we talk sincerely, isn't it ? I said two! - Two what? - 42. - What 42? - 42 underpants. - Size 42 underpants? - 42 or 44... But 2... Francoise... Sir wants some underpants. No! One or two, that's all. - With or without pocket ? - Yes... - Bikini or not? - Yes, the same. - Cotton or nylon? - Two... - What size? - 2. 2? I think that is too small. Rather 4. Two and four. - Hilda! - Yes? Sir wants the underpants size 2 or 4? 2... seems to Jean-Jacques. Oh, no... think about it. Jean-Jacques has a thin waist, while Mr. has a large waist. He hasn't large waist, he has narrow shoulders. He hasn't narrow shoulders. And then, you compare him with Jean-Jacques which looks like hell. You can't wear this, you look ridiculous. - Would you like something else? - No! Sir.! Sir... sir, you forgot your underpants. With this my first victory upon myself and the hostile sellers... I was dreaming to meet Agnes, right away. I was feeling capable to approach her in any circumstance... and conqueror thus fortress. - Sir? - Two "Alexandra", quickly... - Two? - Two or four... Yes. I am still happy that I haven't lost my dignity, getting out of that bar... Sure, only one lesson wasn't enough to approach her. I must, for the moment, follow my treatment. With patience and humiliation. You will learn to address to the persons who impress you. To whom? - Mr. Henry... - What? I know that your time is important... but I would like... - You would like what ? - Nothing. I am very content of being here among you. - And? - Look. It is about the reorganization of the kitchen tasks. I have few ideas which I want to share with you. Are you mocking me? Think of your work. - Mr. Henry, please - What it is ? It is an issue regarding my job. What is with your job ? I was convinced that it would interest you. Look... because I take the dishes with my left hand... and the trash bin is placed on the left, I could make a dangerous move with the dish and I might make the water dirty. Without counting the movement, the loss of time... the rentability for the hotel. So? So, if the trash bin would be on the right I turn and everything would be solved. Very interesting - It is my idea. - Congratulations. It was over, I was cured. I can speak like man to man with everybody. I made my point. What a mess... What a mess, look at the car, look here. You should pay more attention. - Mr. Renault? - Mr. Ferrari. Damn it! Look what you have done. You didn't notice when I pushed the break. My clear... But I love you. I am thinking of you. No, I will be a little bit late. There is no woman involved. The chant of 600.000... Nice, isn't it? Maybe he needs more help... I will pay attention with the peaked cap. It is a gift from her. Beautiful woman, but a little savage. For hen am n Nisa. I won't tell more. Let's go. For the first time I can speak about the passion which was burning me. - You will see her, she is beautiful! - Yes, But it is far away. No, she is close, she is there. - Everything all right, Mr. Ferrari? - What? My peaked cap has fallen. - Help! - We will search for it... Help! Virgin Mary, don't leave me... - Do you feel better, Mr. Ferrari? - You can call me Aldo. - Where is your peaked cap? - Mother, I have lost it. Where? The beret which I gave it, so beautiful. You are a looser, I have done many sacrifices for you. - You are completely wet, where have you been? - To the see. - With this... who is he? - A friend of mine. Mother, stop it! Let him in, mother, he saved my life. I take the dish, I wash the dish, I throw the dish, I catch the dish, I dry the dish, I wipe the dish, I put the dish. Your trick is a good one. - May I try it? - Yes. Wait a little bit... she is here... and... I take the dish, I wash the dish, I throw the dish, I break the dish... Don't worry, she is deaf. It is true that she is beautiful but she is wild. During all this time I continued to spy Agnes. The strategy and the techniques of camouflage were equally used... ...by a Cherokee Indian or a marine of the Japanese army. Indian, Japanese, dishwasher, even warrior. The sly trick has always been the weapon of the oppressed people. Miss, please... It is your turn. You get a little bit closer to the ball... ...the hands... ...very good. Step back, I want to hit the ball, go away! - She is? - Yes. - But she is gorgeous! - I told you. Yes, but better forget her. Even myself I don't dare to approach such a woman. But you have your mother! I prepared to Aldo a cherry compote. I hope that his friend will enjoy it as well. - Are you ready, my kids? - Yes, mother. Come on! One, two, three. You move yourself well. Relax... one-two. You are rigid. When you hold her, you must not show such a face. Now I don't hold her, but you. This changes everything. One-two, one, two, three. It is all right mother ? Very good... a little but more rhythm. I don't understand why you dress yourself so grizzly you have a nice vest. You know that it is the style which counts the most. The caress of a beast, superb, the last retouch. It is your turn. Try to succeed because I won't be with you all the time. Damn it! Let's go! She is here! And? Come on! That man dances well. It is all right? Smile to her and say "hello". Go on! - What are you doing? - I am saying "hello". - Don't say it to everybody. - I don't greet everybody. I mark the rhythm. If you do this she won't understand that to greet her! Stop moving your head. You are ridiculous! Look her into the eyes! Damn it! It is easy to look into the people eyes. Look... as I am doing now... - What are you doing? - Shut up, I mark the rhythm. Go! - Are you leaving? - Better don't turn around! Have you seen the power of the sight? Look how it puts you into troubles. Come on, run! Don't forget the eyes! You understand? Yes! Look! Not there, in the eyes, here! Yes! It is the last thing which I do for you. Go! - Where are you going? - There! This is on 400.000 This ball will have buds in the spring. Yes! Well said, look at him! He is called Trinita. Here is your man. Do your task! Again with his tricks, as always! It can't be true! I am carrying 20 bags on my back... That it is. Come on, what he is waiting for... Damn it! - Are you nut? - He was starring at me! And what do you care? Everybody is starring! Usually, he enjoyed this. - Yes, but he looks me straight into my eyes - But where would you like to watch you? Sir, please, don't look at him! It's all right... I'm not concerned that he is watching me, but he should do it in overall... That is, look him overall! If not, he will have a nervous breakdown They are playing on 400.000! I can't, I can't, he wrings my arm! Mr., please, go behind him. Otherwise, we won't finish this. Go over there, don't look at him, otherwise we will playing until tomorrow. Go on, he is behind you. - I am... I am sure that he's watching me! - No, he isn't watching you. Nobody is watching you, Mr. Trinita. Shut up! Stop getting me nervous, all right? If you would care more about the balls and less about the others. Aha, look! He is watching me! I told you! And what do you care if he is watching you? He is behind you! Even there, he drives me crazy! Please Mr., go away from him. Otherwise we will never finish this. He will never may has tum... - And why you are looking at him ? - To see if he is watching you. - Is he watching me? - No! And then, why do you look at him? We need to look at something. You don't want to be watched. Where should we look? What... at the balls! We are here to play. How do you dare to tell us such thing? We are waiting you for one hour to throw that ball! Damn it! We won't call him Trinita! Leave him to me! Leave him to me and I will take care of him! - Pierre! - Aldo! What a pity that my girlfriend doesn't play petang. From now on, I could easily make her to observe... the intensity of my feelings. I see that... you have a Mack eye too. Don't tell it to anybody... especially to my mother. I don't... I never had such a good time like yesterday. Really? What good time we have! Stop it! There is no need to ask... who have washed this... dirty glass! - Show me how do you wash them. - Sorry! All right... I got it. Give it to me! First, look from where I hold the glass. From bellow, not from above! - No, you should look at the glass. - Yes... When I let the water to run normally, nothing happened... everything is like before. Pay a little attention when I try to explain you something. To get the fight pressure. I press, little by little, the end of the hose. You see? Pay attention to the place where I put my finger. You see what the water does on the bottom of the glass. - Interesting, isn't it? - Yes. All right. Now it is your turn. Dirty and awkward. - Come here! - Yes! Hotel Negresco, good morning! Good morning! Hotel Negresco, I'm listening! Yes? To whom would you like to speak? To the reception. Here is the reception. Good morning. Good morning. To whom would you like to speak? I... I have screwed it up. This is impossible to solve. So, have you seen the power of your sight? It is the moment to try with her. If you don't want to spend your life just following her. Come on! - What are you doing? - In this way she won't recognize me. Reception of Hotel Negresco, good morning. It is not me who made the previous call. Please, give me the restaurant. A reservation for Pierre Renault, 12:30. Thank you. Listen what you will order... grapefruit, grill, a piece of cheese... I think that it won't exceed 100 francs. Without coffee because isn't healthy. - I will eat all these? - Yes. Go on! - What are you dong here? - I have a reservation, Mr. Henri. - What kind of reservation you have? - Lunch reservation, Mr. Henri. It is my not working clay. Put him at the table no12. Between a column and Mr. Henry, I was risking not to see Agnes. If you would like to see the menu list. O grapefruit cocktail and a grill. Mr., I am so sorry but we are out of grill. The gentleman seems to appreciate the fish and I dare to recommend him lobster... which tastes very good. Of course, there will be some price differences. The gentleman decides. Well, yes... It is a pleasure to eat lobster from time to time... and afterwards, I recommend you quail with grapes prepared by the chef cooker. Yes... very good. And in the end, a little Norwegian omlette ? A little one, yes. And now, between us. Please! So, we start with "soasonedl" lobster. - Believe me, it will be very "soasoned" (stiff). - 140 without servicing! Then we continued with quail with grapes. 68 francs! And we finished with Norwegian omlette. 54 francs! Your modest bill, Mr. - Waiter. - Mr. A brandy! Any troubles, inspector? A looser who can't pay his bill. Give me merely 300 francs. I'm here, you moron. Waiter! - Please, bring me a cigar! - Right away, sir. Two! One for my driver. Sir is so... kind. - So... she has seen you? - No, because of the column. Yes! I have eaten well. I little bit stiff, but tasty! Indeed, 400 francs but she hasn't seen you. You know. 400 francs for a lobster. I didn't find it expensive. Thank you for the coat and thank you for the peaked cap. How, you didn't find it expensive? Look, I see her without paying anything. - What is she doing? - She leaves. It was clear. Agnes couldn't be where I am. What she was thinking? That I will follow her and leave Aldo? I abandoned Aldo and I was having remorses. Stop! Deauville! You are a moron! Damn it! It is not true! Why I meet you again? You are a incurable moron. Damn it! I have taken care of that moron. You know, I won't be all the time with we. I work... I have a girlfriend. The lady wearing peaked cap. A tigress. There are no indestructible heroes. Lesson no12! - Waiter! - Waiter! You sodomites! Have you seen the hero? Be careful! This car has never stayed outside the garage! - 3,400. - No, Mr.! I bought it by 9,000 francs 8 years ago! - 3,400. - Never! - 3,300. - We have a deal! May we rent this one? I couldn't regret the sale of Aldo's car. This allows me to get higher position in the society. I left Nisa as dishwasher. I introduced myself in Deauville as the prince of oil. Thank you, We boy, you can do whatever you want. All right, Mr.! One single room, two nights! Quickly, please! Room no.528 for the gentleman, quickly! - Please! - You first. Come on! - Room number... you moron! - Yeah, the room number, you moron! 528. - 528, indeed! - Thank you. Mrs. Agnes? You saw? - The style! - The style? At this price? Yes. Distinction! One moment! Don't you have about 20 francs? What a waste! Champagne, tip... stop wasting! I haven't sold my car for all these! We are here with important business. Now, you get closer and it is finished. Over! - Yes? - I'm the manicurist. Room 528, please! - May I keep this, Sir? - I always keep it with me. - Sir ? - A White Horse, like my stallion. At a trot! Tell me, Mr... I think that it is difficult to handle this while ridding the horse. One has to be skilled, isn't it? It is a matter of shoulders and hand articulation suppleness. What a moron! Put m the count of room 528. You hold it firmly with your fingers, like this! - Very strong. - Yes. Fully! Come on! Go on! Wait! Silence, please! - May I throw it? Nell, yes! Fully! - You know how to handle it? - Yes, just like my horse. One minute and 36. Bravo! He is my friend! Miss.. again him... my friend! Superb! Miss, if you wish I can stop it! Hello! It's me again! Bravo! Don't stop! He didn't see me. He is one of the most talented of his generation! Would you like to know more? Out of my way! Hello! Out of my way! Men like your friend don't interest me at all. I spent one month among the castle fauna. The castles... there we live. It is the drama of richness. No, I am not the result of such drama. But, then, Why are you here? Because I calculated the Earth-Moon distance in spaghetti. In spaghetti? The winner of the big contest: “One dream month due to the Rivoire et Carret spaghetti", Miss Agnes Jensen! Let's congratulate her! Louder! Miss Jensen, can you tell us how did you find the right answer ? I measured it! She measured it! One moment ladies and gentlemen: she measured the Earth-Moon distance. We may say that it was worth the stay in the most elegant hotels... from Vichy to Deauville... among the high society... in the most distinguished clubs. Really? You measured the distance? Mr. Ferrari has called. He waits for you at the Casino. - At the Casino ? - Yes, sir. And he insisted to tell you to behave natural. - Natural? - Natural. To behave natural! Gentlemen, be ready! Betting is over, no more bets! Please, put those things in front of the lady. Smile Miss, you are rich. Thank you. You have 10 minutes. Well done, you played well I don't gamble, I pay my trip. Miss, I tell you that Pierre is a dishwasher... Did you meet many dishwashers who play polo ? One moment, everything can be explained! There he comes! - For the personnel! - Thank you, Sir! And here is the dishwasher. - It is a misunderstanding - No... Let him go! Marcel, are you all right? Gentlemen, prepare yourselves for the game! Qua d'Orsay? What's the lucky number for tonight? - 28... - 15... 15. You can't bet any more. 15 black, odd. - Thanks to the personnel. - The personnel thanks you, sir. You know... he is a very shy guy and he takes medicines. - I see. The treatment works! - Thanks to met! Prepare yourselves for the game, gentlemen! 10.000 to the bank. He doesn't even know what all this means. Thank you... That it! We are rich! - Stop it! She is a seller. - What? She won a contest. She likes only the poor people. - Then we are poor people! - With the thing you keep in your hand? - What we can do? - Show him the social insurance card! I don't have it with me. It's all right, we will explain her. - Mr. you won! - Again? I didn't put them there! - Aldo, come here to see! - What? I put them here and... Watch out where you put your money. I must stay with you all the time. - What we will do now? - The things get complicated! Miss, don't go! I have sold my car for him to play in this night. So, that he can offer you a Rolls Royce! At least we will have the money! Everything is fine. I have lost all money. Murderer! Murderer! - She doesn't like the rich persons. - And we are poor. How to convince her that we are poor people? How could we fouled them at the hotel to think that we are rich people? Tomorrow morning we leave. - Without Agnes? - Forget her. She is not for us, she is too poor. Not the social discrepancy stops me. In few minutes I will come down at arm with my girlfriend. Like Steve MacQueen in “The Towering Inferno“. The brave fireman would have been know to forget the hateful millionaire. And he would have had time to convince her about his feelings. - What? - Fire! Where? What he is dong? Get down. We start it again. Help! Save me! Quickly! I am coming. There is no fire, like there are no dishwasher, no firemen. Agnes, I love you. One day at the hotel... from behind the desk, I saw you... blonde, gorgeous. My god, how much I love her! I love you Agnes! Don't you think that this joke has lasted enough? Open, please! Lady, open up! - I am opening it. - Lady, open the door. Come here, come on! Quickly! Quickly! Let's go. We approach it from behind... From behind... Hurry up! - It worked? - No. - Forget this! - No. A coat Georges Rech. No breach, spotless, no burns. Quickly! And an antelope coat. So, an antelope coat, no spots, no breaks, no burns. A Sauvougnat bag, sport model, a chest... Excuse me. May I? We are disappointed. He is a looser. He has escaped... He rented a car. He not even had money to pay for the room. And about fire... I don't know what was on his mind. Bye. - Go to the front! - No, thank you. It was on December 15th. In my soul the temperature was high. In my crazy race, I have lost everything. My job of chef cashier, six millions in one single night. And I have lost Agnes as well. I was forgetting about those two things size 42 which were squeezing me terrible. Aren’t you sad because the vacation is over? - Will you return to your job tomorrow? - Yes. Tell me, Gilles... What does it mean for you, a guy who sets a hotel on fire? A piroman. But a guy who sets fire from love? A moron. It is clear, I love the morons. I don't dare. You go. You don't dare? When I sold my car, you had no remorse. Anyway, it isn't that difficult to make the stop. Pierre, I won't be all the time with you. You see? It isn't magic. The sight is everything. Impossible, it is a truck. - We won't get in a truck! - You are right. Thank you! Go, go! It is all right, go! - It's coming after us, isn't it? - Yes. Don't insist, we are not going. Come on, we are going! Let's go!
