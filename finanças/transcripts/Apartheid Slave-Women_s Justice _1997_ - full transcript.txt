- Hi, I'm Ted V. Mikels, a film maker. World peace has not been achieved in the century, and may never be achieved. The film you are about to see is about man's inhumanity to man. (percussive music) (ominous music) (percussive music) (structures explode) (screams) - [Radio Announcer] On the second front, the Liberation Army is meeting heavy resistance by the better equipped and better trained Army of the Republic. Casualties are heavy on both sides, but the fighters of the New Order remain determined to push through to the country's border. Food supplies remain scarce, and fighters are weary, and are often without water, making gains even more difficult. This radio frequency will continue to report news of the warfare hourly, with momentary updates on major changes. Keep tuned to this frequency. (distant explosion) (distant gun fires) (bomb whistles) (distant explosion) - Well, I don't care what in the hell they're doin'. I own this plantation, and I sweat blood to keep it! And I ain't leavin'. - You better take what you can now. I see the handwriting on the wall. - Oh, you're nuts woman. You're always seeing things that ain't there. You takin' what you want? - I'm takin' what I need to get by. I'm only allowed one bag on the airplane, and it's the last one out of here. - Yeah? What about all them fancy dresses and expensive shoes and jewelry you bought? - I have enough cash and jewelry. Just let the maidservants and the slaves have the rest, and if you have any sense, you'd get out now, too, while you can. - Eh, I don't need you tellin' me what to do woman. I'll get out when I'm damn good and ready. - Good luck, you're gonna need it when they take over. - Yeah? What the hell can they do to me? When I leave this place, it'll be over my dead body. - That's not gonna do you much good. You're gonna be wishin' you were on that plane with me. - Eh! Good riddance, woman. (distant gun fires) - Let's get outta here. - What's the matter? - My husband is not leaving. - He's not leaving? He's gotta go. - It's his choice. Now, let's go. - But if he stays here, they'll wind up killing him. - Oh, that's his problem and his choice. The plane leaves in less than an hour, and I'm gonna be on it. Now, let's go. (bomb whistles) (car revs) - What the hell are you lookin' at? Get busy, and you, too. - Ah, good news. The take over is nearly complete. All the plantations, farms and property-owned lands have been confiscated by the new order. - What we done with 'em? - They'll be turned over to the former slaves and servants. Now, they'll be in total control of everything. Previously owned by the Landowners. These are formal decrees for claiming the legalities of the transfer. Deliver a set of these every specified household. - Who do they give 'em to? - They'll be given to the head servant in each household. Carry on. - What's goin' on here? - You don't own me anymore. - Yeah, I'll show you who owns who. Did you whip her? - Strung her up, whooped her and branded her. Didn't do no good. - Yeah, I'll show you who owns who. Turn her around. (whip snaps) (slave cries) - Please, show her some compassion, please? - Compassion, hell? You want some of the same? (whip snaps) (slave cries) Turn her around. She wants compassion. I'll show you compassion. I need new blood in my bed. You want compassion? You get up in my bedroom. I'll show you compassion. - I'd rather die first. (slave spits) - Listen. She runs away again, you take that rifle, and you track her down, and you kill that little black bitch, you understand. (officer knocks) - Yes? - I'm here for the New Order. These papers make the head maid, the servant Wateesah, the new commandant in control of this plantation. - And what of the Landowner? - He is no longer the Landowner. If he has not fled, arrest him. Form a court and try him. Whatever sentence Wateesah imposes will be upheld by the New Order. Do you understand? - Yes. - I can't take this no more. - You may not have to. Not for much longer. - Why? - Everything she left is ours. Everything. - Everything she owned? - Everything, from her shoes to her jewelry. Her clothing. Everything is ours. - Hmm. (intense music) (servants chat) - Money! - Money! - Money! - Money! - Money. (servant laughs) - You can help me find that money. It's my money, this is mine. - This is so beautiful. - Gorgeous, gorgeous. - Our stuff, now, our stuff. - You be careful with my gun, that's loaded. (Landowner gasps) - Do you know who I am? - Yes. You're Wateesah. You're my main servant and head maid of the household. - No longer so. I am Your Majesty. You shall refer to me as Your Majesty, is that clear? - Yes. Yes, Your Majesty. - And hereafter, and during the course of this trial, you shall refer to me as Your Majesty. Is that clear? - Yes, yes, yes. - Yes, what, you stupid pig? - Yes, Your Majesty. - Your escape from this country was totally unacceptable to us. You taking your ill gained wealth and possessions from amongst us was more than we could bear. Consequently, it became necessary for us to take the law into our own hands. Since there is no law presently functioning in this land, this court has assembled together to take you to trial and try you for what you have done. - [Landowner] What do you mean try me? What do you mean try me? You're all my servants, all of you. You're all my servants, how dare you. - [Wateesah] Silence. Or has the blow to your head from the heel of my shoe dimmed the memory of your misdeeds? - You're crazy. You're all crazy. I order you to release me. You're crazy! - Enough of this. You are a prisoner of this court. We have stripped you of all of your earthly possessions, and this court will bring you to trial. - Ah, you're crazy! I order you to release me. - You are no longer our lord and master. You are a prisoner of this court. Ah, now, the table's are turned. You're apartheid release will be struck from your memory. And we hereby make you aware that I am to be your judge. And these, my sisters, your jurors. We will try you and determine the extent of your guilt, and judge you accordingly, in this, our court of justice. - I'm guilty of nothing. Guilty of nothing. - Enough of this. Hereafter, you will speak when you are asked to speak. And you will address me in the manner that you have been advised. - Yes. Yes. - Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty. - Further, you will sink to your knees when you address me. Now! That's better. I have been ordained by this court to do with you as I wish. You have kept my people in bondage and slavery all the days of my life, and many before me. - I done nothing. Why do you do this? Who's taken care of you? I've taken care of, and you've been my maid servant since you were a little child. - You have done it all. You forced me not only to be your maid, but your mistress. You forced my body to be the unwilling receptical for your maleness. - But your country, I've done nothing. I've done nothing. I'm not guilty of anything. - You stood by while all the treachery was happening. With this country's soul, we invoked the yoke of bondage and freed our people from under the heel of your tyranny. You and your kind are all that was left. (court murmurs) - I stood behind you. I tried to help. I thought I took care of your sisters. But, I stand behind that-- - No. Do not lie. In this court, we'll uncover the truth. But you will be of assistance, Mr. Landowner. Mr. Would Be God, or should I say anti-God. Satan himself. But you will help us agree here, and we will make you an example. (intense music) - You're crazy. All of you! You're crazy! I've done nothing! You're crazy! All of you! - Silence! - Shut up! - Or now this weapon will make a trial unnecessary. (court murmurs) What we will try you for will be for others who have unjustly enslaved and ruled us. Your final act, resulting in the deaths of 37 of our people, was when you ordered your men to round up the village families, entrapping them in chain-linked fence topped with barbed wire. When the word spread that you were taking them to another place, to be sold to a distant Landowner, they panicked. (woman screams) The thought of being removed from their families and their homes was much more than they could understand or accept. The strongest broke through the chain fence. And in their stampede to run for freedom, you apprehended them. All 37. They were trampled to death. Men and women. But what we can never forget are the children. 37 trampled, dead. - [Landowner] That wasn't my fault. - You caused their deaths. We hold you totally responsible for this. - Lies. I'm not guilty. Anything I've done. Not at all, not at all. I'm not guilty! They're lies! - We will judge you for your transgressions and misdeeds, not only against myself, but against the other who have suffered under the yoke of bondage and inhumanities committed upon us in your household. You will be tried for your personal injustices and cruelties. And if my lady jurors so find you to be guilty, executed in a manner that they choose to be fitting. - [Court Members] Yes, yes! - But first, my jurors shall introduce themselves. - Butra. - Suhya. - Sellahlie. - Fleurlilli. - Etrosef. - Wishtofti. - Petrinah. - Belahsa. - Raybutta. - And have you ladies of the jury chosen a spokesperson? - Yes! - Yes, we have. - Yes! - Yes, we have chosen Butra to be our spokeswoman. - Butra, Butra. - Yes, Your Majesty? I would rather have been selected as his executioner. But then, who knows? (Landowner grunts) - Maybe I will be. - Maybe we will all be his executioners, should he be found guilty. Have you decided the manner in which he is to stand trial? - [Butra] Yes, we have, Your Majesty. - [Wateesa] And what manner will it be? - We have decided that he will lie down on the floor, on his back! With Your Majesty's feet pressed into pit of his stomach. (Landowner grunts) As it was with you in your childhood. As for for the rest of us, we will place our chairs around him! And press his back to the floor. Under our shoe, he and what he represents to us, deserves to be treated as dirt beneath us. - [Jurors] Yeah! - [Woman] And if he tongue is loose, our kicks may find him. (jurors chide) - [Wateesah] So be it. - [Landowner] You can't do this to me. - [Butra] Now, on your back! Now! Or you're going down, a-kicking. (Landowner breathes heavily) - Yes, strangely befitting. The shoe is on the other foot, now. When we as children, according to your custom, lay down on our backs, under your cold and unfeeling feet. Which were pressed in the pit of our warm little bellies. We were used to absorb the pain and afflictions from your body, the cold deadly, transmitting your pain to us. The only pain I remember was once as a child. You were in a hurry to stand, and you did not first remove your feet from my stomach. Your full weight upon my tiny body forced the air from my lungs, and my mouth filled with the food from my stomach. Your body is much bigger and stronger as mine was as a child. Perhaps, the sharp heels of my shoes pressed against your body will make up the difference, should I choose to stand upon you as you did me, you pig. Let us proceed with the trial. Let us first take an oath. Do you as jurors swear that the testimony you are about to give, and the charges you are about to make, are true as seen or witnessed by your eyes, and not the hearsay of others? - [Jurors] Yes. - Yes. Let's proceed with the trial then. Butra. You may start with the charges. - First, let me say that this evil person branded my man with the r for run away. Then, had him killed. - Call upon the others for their charges. - Yes, Your Majesty. - You know, you know I'm not guilty of these things. I have done nothing, nothing like that. They're lies! (jurors yell) - Stop! Stop, sit down, save it for until the trial is complete, and sentence has been passed. - [Landowner] Sentence for what? What do you mean passed sentence? - Butra, now do you have witnesses for these charges? - Yes, Your Majesty. I will now call upon FLeurlilli for her testimony. - No, no, please. Keep her away from me, keep her away. - My mother was enslaved by this very man. At an early age. And I was born in the fields. Then, one day, this very man brought my mother into his household, and made her into his personal slave. Cooking and cleaning, from sun up to sun down. She had no life of her own. I saw her lie down and die, a tired old woman. As long as she was alive to keep me from you, I was barely a slave. But when mamma died, he used me. (ominous music) I was beaten half to death by this man. I was so scared that he would kill me if I didn't give into his wants. I charge this man with enslavement. I charge you with sexual molestation of my mind, body and person. (Landowner groans) I charge this man with continuous rape! (Landowner groans) I would enslave him. I would cut off his private parts! - [Landowner] Oh, no, no. - I'd work him and work him! And work him! He would feel the sting of my whip! I would whip him and whip him and whip him! Until death would relieve him of his agony! - Thank you for your sworn testimony, FLeurlilli. - I would now call upon, for the last of our testimony, Belahsa. (thunder cracks) - When I was very small, your people came to the field. They chose me to be a slave in your household. I screamed and I cried. I didn't want to be away from my mother, my brothers and sisters. They took me by the hair and they dragged me. But my uncle, my beloved uncle with his beautiful love for me didn't want to see me taken to the field, to the mansion. To this man's mansion! - But I didn't hurt you. - He begged them. He pulled on their arms, he pleaded with them not to take me. Until they hit him and knocked him stiff into the ground. They beat him with whips, and then when one tired, the others took over. When he tried to cover and protect himself, they whipped him for doing it! They whipped him to death! - [Landowner] I didn't do it, my men did it. - For years, I couldn't erase this vision from my memory. I worked and slaved for you, yet I hated you for the murder of my uncle! Ah, with this whip, I could slay you alive, mister. I would whip you until the leather was red with your blood and your breath stopped blowing within you. (Landowner chokes) I hate your guts, Master. And when my arms gave out from whipping you, my sisters would take over. I charge you with cruelty, enslavement, and the murder of my uncle! I would beat you dead for your crimes. - And I, likewise, would see this man blind and run to death. And that death may be his fate. - I will now call upon Raybutta for her testimony. - My fellow jurors, I saw this man kill a 19-year-old boy! 19! Why? Because his wife, she wanted him! She wanted his body pressed against hers! And then he refused! He refused! So, he came to back door, and he made him, made him confess to touching her! (Landowner grunts) I saw him! I saw him! He took and dragged and beat this 19-year-old boy. He covered him with tar. And then he burned him. - Help, help, help! - Kill him! (jurors yell) (landowner gasps) - Stop it, stop it! - I will now call upon Petrinah for her testimony. (Thunder rolls) - I, Petrinah, charge you, an enemy of my country, with the acts of treason! With the acts of brutality against my people! Acts of murder, enslavement! Some of our meager cash resources with our purses recovered from your baggage. These acts against each and every one of us present. Will he draw execution if they were perpetrated against your people? By any of us? Your court would convict and execute us without any hesitation. For these same acts. I'm witness to your crimes. I'm witness to your years of infamy. Those things are unforgivable. There must be a vengeance. And eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. A life for a life. I say death for you now! Death for you now! At the hands of this court. (Landowner groans) - You can't mean this, you can't mean this. - Please, please. I protest. No more speaking of death and killing. It is not for us to take this man's life, or to spill his blood. This man may be guilty of these crimes, but here he lies under our feet like an animal, drugged into insensitivity. Are to play God in determining this man's fate? In defense of this man, he is not a totally evil person. I have seen him at times when he was a warm and caring person. Must it be we who play the roles of executioners? The Lord above may hold us accountable if we take justice into our own hands. And the cast the venom of our revenge against him. - Etrosef, this is a pig lying under my heel. And unfeeling animal. A worm. He represents all that is evil in our lives. He and his people are the death of many! And the near death of us ourselves! God has charged us with the responsibility to bring this man to justice, and answer for his crimes. - No, no please. - If we, the people, the victims, cannot bring this man to justice, who can, and who will? - Butra, you say we are empowered to legally judge, convict, or exercise punishment upon this man. But should not another court of the people bring him to trial, and convict or execute him for his crimes? We must not have his blood on our hands. (Landowner groans) - You are right Etrosef, we must not have his blood on our hands! But consider it under our feet! This scum must be brought to justice here and now. We must wipe the likes of him from the face of the earth. Since he has planned escape and almost made it without ever being brought to trial, it is up to us that justice is done! - We, we are the people of the court. You are not only jurors, but are giving sworn testimony to the charges against this man. I am presiding judge. And together, we represent the people of this land. We are the law. We are the law created out of chaos. And it is our God-given duty to prosecute this man. And execute whatever sentence this court decides. (bell chimes) Yes, yes we shall pause for the feast of the elder's crown. We will pause for the holiday, and commence with judgement tomorrow. (Landowner groans) - [Landowner] You can't leave me here like this. Let me outta here! You can't leave me here in these chains! - Mmm, oh. - Shh. (rhythmic music) (ominous music) - Mister Landowner! (Landowner gasps) A kick for every time you took me against my will! (Landowner grunts) - Yes, it is I. A whip for each month you kept me as your personal slave and servant, too! (Landowner cries) (rhythmic music) (Landowner groans) - Dumping him down in the cellar. They'll kill him before the trial's over. - Can you blame them? (Landowner groans) - Stop! - Get down, right now. (Landowner yells) (cheerful music) (intense music) - No one's allowed. - I know, my child, but please? We need to show the Master a little compassion. - We put him in the cellar to keep him safe. - I know child, but please? Just a little sip, child. Show the man some compassion. Just a little sip, child. Please, child, please? God bless you. (ominous music) Hello, sir. I'm Sister Mary Ellen, and I'm here to pray for you. - I don't need no prayers. - Everyone needs prayers, even the saints need prayers. You sir, you need to pray and ask God for your forgiveness. - I don't need no damn forgiveness! I ain't done nothin', I'm innocent. I tell ya, I'm innocent. - Sir, even the innocent needs prayer. Jesus loves you. Jesus forgives you for all the crime that you committed. Jesus loves you. - I don't need no forgiveness for nothin'. I have done nothin'. - Jesus will forgive you. Jesus would take in all the suffering that you caused upon people. All you need to do is ask for forgiveness. Pray. - I ain't asking for no forgiveness. What you got in that cup? - I just have a little something for you. I know you have to be thirsty. I'm compassionate. Just a little sip. - Yeah, I am thirsty. - Drink up. There you go. Drink up, yes. Yes, drink it down! Yes. How's that feel? - Good. - Yes. Can you feel it? Huh? - Hey, hey. - It's taking it's toll, huh? Tastes good, huh? Would you like some more? Just a little more. Yeah. It's working nicely. Yes. Yes, the poison is workin' nicely. I'm no nun! Does this look like a nun's face to you, now? I'm no Sister Mary Ellen. This is no nun's face. But you look, you look very closely! Does this look familiar to you? It should! Yes, it should! Because you hurt me and my people! You persecuted my people! Now, you're going to be judged! You're gonna have a judge and jury, and you gonna find you guilty! Guilty as charged! And now, you're gonna pay! You're gonna pay! This how you treat my people! You're gonna pay! Yeah! This is the poison takin' it's toll upon you! Ah! Yes! Yes! Get in there! I hate you! You killed my brother! You killed my people, and now you're gonna pay! This is how you should be treated, like a dog, like a bug! Just stomped into the ground! You gonna pay! You! You did this to my people! And we had to work that plantation! Months at a time, blood and sweat! My brothers are dead! My brothers are dead! My people! And now you gettin' the same portion! I hate you! And they, they're gonna persecute you. You're gonna be judged and persecuted. Guilty! Guilty, as charged! Guilty for kicking my people, killing my brother, my sister, guilty! This is all for the suffering of my people, and if they don't kill you, I'll come back and make sure the job is done! (Landowner groans) Thanks, a lot. I showed the Master a little compassion. Thanks. (party music) (intense music) - What do you want in here? What do you want from me? What are you doing? What are you doing? I treated you well. What are you plannin'? No. What are you doin'? What? What? What are you doin'? (Landowner gasps) (women kick) (Landowner groans) - You know what you did to my sister. I'm gonna make sure you never do it again. (Landowner groans) (cheerful music) (Landowner cries) - Please? - Ah, go to hell. You want some of the same? (woman kicks) - [Landowner] No more. (Landowner groans) Cant' take no more. No. (whip snaps) - [Landowner Voiceover] Did her whip her, clear then? Run away will ya? (woman cries) (woman screams) - [Landowner Voiceover] You like that? You brand her? Brand 'em all. (mumbles) - [Landowner] No. No. (woman kicks) (Landowner cries) No more. - [Woman Voiceover] Don't you dare touch me! Stand back! No! No! - [Landowner Voiceover] Get her. Get her. You won't run away again. (whip cracks) - Take that rifle, and you track her down, and you kill that little black bitch. You understand? (Landowner groans) (woman kicks) - [Landowner Voiceover] Sure do love killing. Brand her! (Landowner groans) - Ah! - [Landowner Voiceover] Shame it didn't rip her arm off! Brand 'em and they won't run away again. (Landowner cries) (rhythmic music) (mumbles) - He used this to beat me with. - [Landowner] But I only beat her once in a while. And only when she needed it. It's not negligence. - Thank you, Your Honor, for the clarifications and rights of the privileges of this court. We know he is guilty of all of inhumanity. Each of us here are witness to his merciless crimes. Of which is punishable by death, a little ruin us in this court. This man must be made an example for those who were before seized atrocities against in our land, or in any other! - [Landowner] Those weren't atrocities, those were my rights. I had rights. - Sellahlie, you have not spread you charges. What say you for this man's crimes? - Jurors all. Hear me. I have seen many cruelties. Many more than I care to recall, and many more than you could ever see again. Many were perpetrated, by this evil, Satanic man! We were forced to lick the foot of his kind and his people. And while we were licking, we were kicked into licking more. - [Landowner] We had to stay in control. We needed control. - I prayed and prayed for the day he licked my foot! My shoe! (mumbles) I have prayed and prayed for that day! - I beg Your Majesty, that we allow her this little pleasure. What say you lady jurors? - [Jurors] Yes! - [Butra] That is yes, Your Majesty! To order the prisoner to oblige by licking the dirt clean off Sellahlie's foot. - [Wateesa] Yes, and so it be. The prisoner is so ordered. I order you to obey, now! - Lick it! Lick it clean, as all your people have forced us to do. - [Landowner] No, no, I have money. I have much money. I'll give you all money. - You had money! You thought you would escape. But, we have your money, now. It rightfully belongs to us. This court has called for the (mumbles) You have nothing left to (mumbles) We all have it. Have it all. Now, lick as you have been ordered! Lick now! Before I crush you to the floor with my spike! That's the way! That's where he belongs! Licking our feet! Forever! Now, I say to you and to you lady jurors, is this not an admission of guilt? - [Jurors] Yes! Guilty! - Let this not differ our minds with pity. Now that we've observed this wretch doing what he should have been doing since the day he was born. - [Landowner] I gave you everything. Clothes, money, shoes, jewelry! You-- - Now, are there more charges? - Yes, Your Majesty. We the jury charge this man with rape, enslavement, plunder and treason against our country! The very act of terrorism, and murder. - Very well. Since this man has no defense, whatsoever, for his crimes, and since I have been given free choice to decide the method in which he is to be executed, you will cast your ballots first. A unanimous decision is not necessary. A majority rules. If he is found not guilty, he will be set free. He will walk away unharmed. All of his earthly possessions returned to him - [Jurors] No! Never! - If, however, you find him guilty, he will die. And he will be executed according to your wishes. - [Landowner] You don't have rights to say that. - You may now cast your votes. - You're right. We the jurors have decided upon an act of compassion. We have decided that our prisoner should be further trusted. His mind, then, will allow more (mumbles) of what other sentence imposed upon him, should this jury find him guilty. - [Landowner] No, no drugs. - This court will let the prisoner decide. - [Landowner] I dislike the fact I saw a fist. No more, no drugs, no drugs. Whiskey, whiskey. Gimme some whiskey, whiskey. (Landowner gurgles) Whiskey. (Landowner gurgles) (horn sounds) - Your wish has been granted. Butra, you may proceed with the ballots. - Lady jurors, please cast your votes, and then place them in the holder. - I repeat to you for clarity, a unanimous decision is not necessary. The majority rules. I trust that you will cast your ballots as your hearts have spoken to you. Go. - [Landowner] You're full of, you're crazy! You're crazy! You can't make the law, yet! That's why you're all crazy, you fools! - You are wrong, we are the law! The newly acclaimed law! - Yes! - We are judge, jury and executioner in your case. - [Jurors] Yeah! That's right! (Landowner groans) - [Landowner] Wait, wait, wait, don't be foolish. I have much money to give you! I have money hidden. I have money hidden. - As we have told you, we are not interested in your money. We have confiscated all your ill gained bounty. We are interested that justice be done. - [Landowner] But I've already given you everything. I've given you so much! You can have it all, you can have everything. Wait, wait, I beg you. I beg you! Please, please? I will get money, I will pay you all. I will pay, pay well. I have money in other places, I'll pay you all. Please, please? - As God is my judge, I am your judge. And you will not be set free. But you will be sentenced by the will of this court. - [Landowner] Wait, wait. You don't have any authority to do this. You have my weapons, and your chains are cutting my wrists, but you still can't do this! (thunder rolls) - Suhya, collect the ballots. Guilty. Guilty. Not guilty. (jurors murmur) Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. And now my vote. Guilty! The verdict is death! - No! Oh, no! No, you're all fools. You're all fools! You can't take the law into your own hands. Your plenty of fools. - We are the law. The newly acclaimed law. We are judge, jury and executioner in your case. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Please, please, please. My slaves. I have much money. I have a way to give you wealth. I have a way to give you money. Please release me. Please release me. I will give you money. I have jewels, I have, I will give you-- - As we have told you, your money has been confiscated by this court. We are not interested in your money, but that justice be done. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. I have money elsewhere. Money, money that you didn't get. I will pay you all well. I will pay you all well! Release me. I will pay you well. I will make you wealthy. I will give you much money. - As God is my judge, I am your judge. You will not be set free. But you will be sentenced by this court. And according to the wishes of my jurors. - No, no please, please, please. Please, please, I beg of you, please! - Silence from you now, or this weapon will put an end to your crimes. Now jurors, you will vote again. This time for one of the four methods I have selected for his execution. I have chosen these alternatives from all of the crimes from which he has committed. Number one, he will kneel before me, blindfolded, then be shot by his former slave, now queen and judge. Number two, he will be hanged by each and every one of you. Rope stretched taughtly around his neck until the life is gone from him. Number three, he will be knifed, stabbed again, and again, and again, until the blood drains from his body. He will be stabbed again and again, until life ebbs from him. Number four, he will be trampled to death. He will be stomped to slime under the heels of our shoes. He will be pulverized, and his remains will lay open on the bare ground. He will be trampled until his remains seep into the earth. - [Landowner] You can't do this. - Butra, you shall now instruct your main jurors to cast their ballots. - Yes, Your Majesty.
