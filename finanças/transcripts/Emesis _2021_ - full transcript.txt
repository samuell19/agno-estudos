"Local scientist is convinced he discovered a parallel universe" "Where?" "The weird case of the missing scientist" "Trapped in another dimension!" "No clues about Hector Russo disappearance" "Affected area. Here!" I'll take a bath... Try to clean this a bit and... ...please take a rest too. Dad? No, dad, no... It's me. Come back! Dad? Dad? Awesome, girls! You killed it! You kill it, my loves! That was a hell of a show! A lot more people than last week! See? Hear them roar for you! Now we got the photos. Photo time! Some autographs... C'mon, girls, just a couple! Autographs! You queen, there! Thanks... Thanks... -Come here, beautiful. -No, wait... Just wait... Stop, let go! Stop! Get the hell off, creep! Fuck off! Hey, what happened? -What happened? -Nothing happened. It happened. I froze. -And that's an issue? -I hate it was a public issue. What do you mean? Vulnerable. Oh! And what happens if you look vulnerable? Nothing. -Alright. -Nothing happens. -Nothing happened. Easy. -Okay. -It's all good, relax. Yes? -Yes... Want some? No dear, I don't mix. Thanks. Yeah, right... Since when? Since forever... Okay, but just a toke. -Tonight was so intense. -Very intense... ...and it'll get more intense, trust me. Two gigs in the same night. Are we a cumbia group or what? Well, what can I say? This was already scheduled. The record company only have time for today, love... ...besides, this is a personal favour to me. -Favour from whom? -Simon. -Yay! Now I see why these rags! -C'mon, I always dress like this. Listen up girls, we're gone. Elle should be home resting. Yes, I'd prefer to call it a night. Calm down everybody. I understand completely, the whole situation... Love, take a look at yourself. You're so divine! Let's do a final effort, pretty please? It was so hard to get this opportunity... Trust me! -Yes, I know. -So, you know how hard it is! -Yes, we do. Well, tonight is the night! Our lives are gonna change! C'mon, friend! Tomorrow you'll be relaxing back home. Do you remember when we started? We were so young! Please don't get so corny! -No kidding now, I need the money. -Of course! If it all turns out right we'll sign and seat to count the bills. -Yes, I'd love it. Yes... -Oh yes! So? Okay, let's do it. Perfect, but this is the last gig. Promised. I gave that creep a pretty good scare, didn't I? Yes. I wanted to punch him in the face. -Is that so? -Yes. Check this out... Can you feel it? My beating heart? You're the reason. As long as this heart keeps on beating I'll always be there for you. How much time do we have left before we go? -Five... ten? -Okay! -Let's go! -Let's go! How long is the ride? Just about an hour and a half. We'll be there before 5 for sure... Rad. Love you. Hey Simon, I've been trying to reach you since this afternoon... Where the fuck are you? You've better solved the record company deal... ...'cos the girls are running out of patience here! It's now or never. Please call me as soon you hear this... or you're dead! You poor thing. Shush... It's okay. That idiot at the club made her think again in her ex's bad history... If it wasn't for Sara... Are we there yet? I think we're close. Everything okay? -Yes. -Yes. She's fierce when it comes to taking care of you... Sometimes too much, right? I don't know, you should have seen your face with that guy... I thought I was over it, but it seems I'm not. Take it easy... Still... ...it gets easier with all of you around. "Are you alright? ...Where are you? I'm worried... We're on our way." Hey, is everything alright? -Yes, it's all good. -So? Simon... he's not answering the phone. What? Pato, you said it was all set. It's all set, Sara. I've been talking with him for a week now... What's odd is... he's not getting my last messages. I'm worried... Listen up. No more surprises, alright? We finish the gig and directly to the locker room... ...no photos, no autographs, no nothing, you hear? -Yes, Sara... I agree. I agree. -Good. What happened? I don't know! It stopped. No idea! -I'll go check. -Okay, go... -Fucking hell! -What is it? I don't know! Engine looks fried. For fuck's sake... Call a tow truck! But I don't have signal. What is it? Let's go. Can you check if your phone works, please? Mine's been dead for long... -Mine's dead too! -Same here! Well... so let's take a walk. Done. Walking from here?! Yeah, walking from here! Gimme a break, would you? I'll send someone to get our stuff as soon as we get there. -Okay! -Let's go! "PUSSY CAKE LIVE" Where the fuck is everybody? At the beach! It is so hot here, girls, please let's go to the beach! -Are we late? -This is an after', goes 'till noon. Maybe it's the wrong date? -No, it's the right date. -Okay, sorry, I was just saying... Pato, pull your socks up! You said it was all set. You're making money with this. Hey, keep calm! To err is human, to forgive is divine... I ain't making shit out of this! Do you have any idea of how much money... ...I put out of my pocket to make this gig happen? So far so good, right? Congrats. Bravo, Pato! Can you please come with me? Simon lives near, just a few blocks... If he's not there we call this off. As soon as I got cell signal, okay? -Want some? -No, Juli... How many of those did you take? Can't really say... My business! I want to go to the sea, loves. Catcha' later! Noo, Juli! No! Come back! Don't go... Ju! Don't be late! For God's pussy! Why do you have to be so hooked up! If he didn't show up the first hundred times, ...don't expect to solve it by kicking the door down. Oh no? -I'll leave him a note... -Ok. "I'm searching for you. Where the fuck are you? Pato." Can't remember... I swear. Really can't remember. I swear. Where are these idiots? What's taking so long? And you, how are you? I'm fine. But you're making me nervous with all the cursing... Me? Making you nervous? I am-- Nothing... Don't want to complicate things. The way you treat Pato, isn't nice at all. And I don't like to see you so... violent. Not constructive. -I'm trying to-- -You don't need to protect me... You've done enough. You're not my mother. Hey... hey. Let's be happy about this present. Come here. Can you feel it? -Yes... -My beating heart? You're the reason. C'mon! Let's get out of here!!! -What happened? -We don't know but it's serious! Simon's house is full of blood. -There's a body! -Dead? Simon? No, no, no... Not him! But haven't you noticed this is a ghost town? -Where's Julieta? -She went to the beach. Couldn't stop her. -What we do now? -We can't leave her. I know, I know... Well, let's go there to find her. -Okay... -Let's go. What happened to you? The heads... -She is delirious. -She's so stoned! -...she took like three acids. -Stop it Sara! She's bad, okay? The heads... Okay, we gotta go. Help me carry her... We gotta go... C'mon... Oh, it's Simon... You sure that's him? Yes, he's Simon. It's him. No, that's not Simon. No... What the fuck was that?! What in the hell happened to Simon?! There was blood everywhere! We're gonna die! We're gonna-- Pato, we need to be sharp! You're making it all worse, can you please stay calm? -Yes... yes... -Good. It's gonna be fine. If we keep dragging her around the town she's not gonna make it. -But we need to go! -We can't leave her behind. Girls, we need to go. Let's hide there! Help me carry her... Let's go. Now we go... She'll be fine here. She's dying, you know? We can't leave her here alone. -I'll stay with her. -What? You're crazy. Here's safe. We go and get some help, then we come back here. You just said it, if we keep moving her around she'll die. I'll stay put. C'mon! I'll stay. -Can you please stay with them? -Yes, count on me. Stay quiet and silent. When you hear the rattle wait a minute and... ...run fast to get inside the first empty house you can find. -Wait... Where you go? -Everything will be fine. They'll stay here. You follow me. -What are you doing? -C'mon! I thought we'd be looking for help. -Tell me, what are we doing? -Shit! No! Help me! -Hope they're alright. -Trust Sara, she knows what to do. What's happening? If this doesn't work we leave, okay? Worst plan in all history! -There he is... -Simon? Yes. That... whatever it is, it's not your friend. It's something else. Don't... call... him. There's something extremely bad about all this. I'll check again. We're good. Whatever that was is now gone. -That was Sara for sure... -I agree. It must have been the signal she mentioned... Help me here, maybe we can open this door. Let me. Alright. He's leaving... Definitely that's not Simon! Not Simon! He's gaining on us! I'm your Pato. Don't you remember me? Remember the good old days!? I fell... Couldn't... I'm sorry. You were right... We shouldn't have come. To do this jackass a favour... I was a dumb ...hot pussy. You take care of them... Take... care. We're safe here. It's all locked. Nothing can get us now. Hey! ...We're here, we're safe. What now? I don't know. -How is she? -Her fever is high. She's not waking up. She won't make it. There must be something we can do. This isn't working either. Guns... We need to get guns to protect ourselves in case-- Knives! I saw knives in the kitchen. Okay. I imagined shotguns... but it's fine. Fine... You stay here. Let's check the rest of the house. Okay, let's find those shotguns. Watch her. If we're lucky, here lives a right-winged guy... ...and maybe we'd improve this. That's pretty lame. Looking for right-winged folks. I'll stay by Juli, if something happens, not sure... you scream? Something really bad happened to this town. Looks like a teen's room. A really strange one. "CERN confirms Multiverse theories." "Affected area. Here!" "No traces of the missing scientist." "WHERE OR WHEN?" Listen to this. "Luckily, Dad always keeps an updated copy of his studies..." "I'm sure I can replicate them." "Mom won't suspect a thing. She never enters the lab..." "...not since Dad disappeared." "I will take precautions. Whatever happened to Dad..." "It can happen again." -Is there a laboratory? -Yes... And maybe guns... Wow... What the fuck is this? I don't know... ...but I don't want to find out. Shotgun... not present. I believe this is enough. How about a little sandwich? Oh... you don't like it? Well... I do. Oh, friend... Is everything fine? Please no Sofi... No! No... no. Noo! -Are you okay? -Yes, I'm fine... ...also my beating heart. He injected himself with this... Healed and took Juli. We have to find her. Let's go! She's alive. Give me that. I got him... -Good! -Yeah! No, keep one just in case. He leaves... Take this... Cover me. Hey friend, I'm here! I will get you out of here! Everything's gonna be fine! Everything's gonna be fine! I can't... C'mon... -Are you okay? -Yeah, easy! I'm alright! -That was rad! -Yeah! That was the last arrow. Now... let's go. No! Juli! No... no... No, no, no... No! Please... leave me! Leave me! -You go and save yourself! -Shut the fuck up! Shut up! C'mon! Let's go! C'mon! Run! Noo! Elle! I... I think I stuck in ...something. Yes. I saw it. Help me... No, Sara... Sara... No. You can't move. You'll bleed out. That guy... He used this to... heal himself. I'll get it for you. I'll go find it and I'll be back. You don't try anything. I don't wanna die. Don't say that because it's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. I'll be back in a sec. Please hold in there. I'll fix it. Hope this shit better work... Sara? It's me, Elle. I know you're somewhere inside... You're not like this. You'd never do this to me. And I know you're listening... I love you. I love you, my love. No... No... Your beating heart... Sara... C'mon, Sara! Hey... Wake up... It's alright. Let's go... It's alright! I love you. Thanks. Thank you all! In the bass, with you all... ...with that indomitable mane, ...Sofi Cake! At the guitar, with those sharp fingers shaking us up... ...Juli Cake! And the third one, but not less important... ...the foundation stone of this band, making us all vibrate with her rhythm, on the drums... ...Sara Cake! And now, let's give some loving to the greatest, lead singer of PussyCake... ...Elle Cake! Thank you all! This was PussyCake! See you next time! Bye!
