There's sharks that could eat or Kill you. Now, who told you that? Oh, my gosh. He's not gonna be able to drive This. Oh, heavens, no. This thing is huge. Can't we just go to branson And swim in the hotel pool where It's safe? Listen, you know what? Statistically speaking, you're Much more likely to be killed by Your sister than a shark.

Hey, mom. So...what do you think of her? Stu, you're really going Ahead with this? No one from omaha goes to California. We're not beach people. We burn easily. Well, ginger has this all Planned out. She really has her heart set On it. We always go to branson. Together. I know--i know we do, but This is gonna be fun, too. You sold the ackerman house? Uh-huh. Ginger, you've been Dethroned. I'm sorry, ginger. It just fell into place. It's big. This is really big. Oh, it--it's fine. I trained you. I'm very proud, actually. Matter of fact, why don't you Take an early lunch to Celebrate? Okay. It's your sale, so it's your Treat? Absolutely. No martinis, you two. Well, you made her day. I'm feeling generous. I'm going on vacation to California. Don't think i'm not jealous.

Meg, i've been--i've been Wanting to go to california for 20 years, and all of a Sudden i'm feeling kind of Scared. You wanna go. It's so exciting. What if something goes wrong? Shouldn't i be worrying about Something? Now you're worrying about not Worrying? You're right. I'm over-thinking it...again. The rest of the world just Gets along, ginger. We live for mediocrity. I don't think it's so Extraordinary to wanna go to Doheny beach. Why doheny beach? I went there 20 years Ago, and it was just a--it was Just a--oh, i don't know... Perfect place. A place where i could create a New history. What's wrong with omaha? Meg, you ever feel like Someone else got your life? Is that one of those riddles With no answers? So why can't kevin come? Because it's not part of The plan. Kevin's not in our plan. It's my 40th birthday, honey, And i wanna go on vacation With my family. Then aunt bonnie and granny Should come. They're family. Not immediate family, and Besides, they always wanna go to Branson. Daddy, please. Think about it. Come on, just think about it. The four of us on vacation at Doheny beach. Mother, please.

I bet you didn't, little Lady. Not this side of town--the bad Side of town. I didn't mean it like that. It's all over your face. Teens, tell her. It's on your face. I'm--i'm sorry. If there's anything i can do to Make it up to you, i-- Well, you know, you could Take teens to her appointment. What appointment? Well, she's gotta check in With her p.o. Parole officer. Oh, yeah. I'm a dealer. What? I'm being monitored. Fake bags, designer knock-off Stuff. You interested in any Merchandise? Uh, no, no, no, i'm--i'm-- I'm--i'm fine right now. Okay, just thought i'd ask. Ooh, you guys can discuss it In the r.v. Teens, get your shit--you got a Ride. No, no, no, no. Oh, wait a minute. You know, we have a schedule. We can't take her anywhere. But you just volunteered. N-no, i did--absolutely not, Kevin, she volunteered, Didn't she? I volunteered? No, i didn't volunteer. All hands on deck. We are ready to shove off. Come on, sweetheart. See ya, kevin. Sorry about the trouble. Come on, kevin. Let's watch 'em leave. Hey, this is not my fault! Mom! Okay, cookie, remind me. How did we go from taking a Nice family vacation in the r.v. To swimming in the shallow end Of the gene pool? (Sighs) Mwah! I can't believe i have to Ride with these psychos. God! What the hell, it's a free Ride. Whoo! Nice. This is like a goddamn ramada Inn. It's really just a basic Unit. It's not top of the line, Really. Don't talk yourself down, Sister, this is real high class. Thank you. Why is--why is she in the R.v.? In fact, when i look around Here, i think style. And when i think style, i think Naugahyde. I've got a real nice quality Naugahyde. $12.99, no tax, no surcharge. I think it would be great for You. Just think about it. Uh, actually, we don't allow Smoking in the r.v. Oh. Yeah. Oh, that's all right. I just do it to show off my Nails, anyway. Oh, well. (Laughs) Can we go? How far off-schedule are we Now? We'll make it up on the road. Don't worry. God. (yawns) Ginger: ugh! Put that out! Stu! Well, that explains it, doesn't The clothes, the attitude? You can see kevin's influence. Now, that's not necessarily True. Cookie is desperate, stu. She's gotten into the habit of Lowered expectations. Look, she's just Experimenting. Ignore it. Ignoring it is a recipe for Disaster. She needs an intervention, and This trip is it. So you're gonna try and Convince her that this trip is All for her benefit? Well, it'll expand her Horizons--make her think beyond Kevin, beyond omaha. Oh, here we are. The police station. And those tacky clothes. They're symptomatic of something Very wrong and very insidious. She dresses fine. Fine if she was in a Production of "kiss of the Spider-woman" for pedophiles. Oh, ginger. Stu, i just want her to know That there are other people out There. I mean, cookie's gonna marry the First guy she falls in love With. Yeah, that sounds horrible. You should save her from that. Oh, honey. I want this vacation for us. We're gonna have fun. We're gonna have a lot of fun. Just like the postcard. Yeah, that's what you keep Telling me, but i'm starting to Wonder if maybe branson wasn't a Better choice. We're not gonna change our Plan now. How can you even say that? Well, you're turning our Vacation into some sort of Crusade. A crusade? How so? Well, look at us. I mean, the kids are miserable, And we're fighting, and we Haven't even gotten out of omaha Yet. We're not fighting. I'm sensing a little denial Coming from you right now. We're not fighting. You know, it's also this Constant competition. I--i don't think you see how you Treat people. You do make judgments. Sometimes judgment is all you Have, and i am damn good at it. You know, how do other Families do it? How do they manage? We can't get out of town without A fight. We're not fighting. We are fighting. We're not fighting! We're fighting! He's right, you're fighting. You know, ginger, what i'm Sensing is maybe a lot of this Is coming out of your need to be In control of the situation. It's not a need, it's a Requirement. I want what's best for this Family, and don't you have an Appointment with your parole Officer, teensie? I know you think you're Yelling at me, but you're really Yelling at yourself. It's called "transference." You're not our counselor. No, well, no she's not, But--but, uh, thing is, uh, Bonnie, uh, mentioned that Sometimes counseling can work Wonders. You talked to bonnie about Our marriage? Oh, stu. She simply mentioned that She knew of a counselor who was Really great who got her Degree from an out-of-state University. Do you hear what you're saying, Stu? Counseling. Do you hear that you're saying "Counseling"? You know what? that's what I'm hearing. I don't see the problem with Getting help from an expert. Counseling is for troubled Marriages. Our marriage is fine. We're happy. We're very happy, all of us. You know what? Daddy's right! Nobody in this family is happy, And it is all your fault! Cookie! Stuart! Do you see what he does to me? Do you see it? He does this to me every time! He just sets me up to be the bad Guy around here. I just wanna go on vacation for My birthday. Is that so selfish? You know what? we're gonna Need to revisit that. I've, uh--i've got an Appointment. Excuse me. You hang in there. What's going on, mom? Where'd everybody go? (Engine starts) Cookie! Come on, sweetie. Come on, you all right? No. It's okay, it's okay. Daddy, can't we please just Call aunt bonnie and granny? I know they'd let us go with Them to branson. No. sorry, sweetheart. Kevin could come. No, i'm sorry. Look, we're gonna settle this, And then we're gonna go to California just like your mom Planned, all right? Here, do you want a sip? Daddy, i don't get it. I mean, you like branson. You love it. You love everything about it. I know. Everybody there is like us. Dad, i-- (sighs) I think kevin would Still be my boyfriend if mom Hadn't butted in and screwed it All up. I mean, she's crazy! She's--she's suffocating-- Hey, hey! Don't talk that way about Your mom, okay? What, you're on her side? I'm not on her-- Great, dad, that's great. I'm not on anyone's side. I knew it. Cook--oh! Cookie! stop! (Car horn honks) Gosh, oh, gosh. Cookie's a runaway... Lost in omaha, and i blame you, Stu. Me? It's not my fault. If you hadn't decided to have A marital moment-- I just want everybody to be Nice. Nice? I am nice, until somebody makes Me not nice. There she is! Stu, go get her. Oh, all right. Bye. Sweetie. Come on, milo. You know, i don't like saying Things that hurt your feelings. I--i don't like-- What, being like her?! Hey, come on. Cookie-- No, let's not have a scene, All right?

You think you can replace This dog? You think you can just go out And buy me another dog and That'll take care of it? No, i didn't mean that. Why not just walk over and Point a gun at granny gainor's Head and blow her brains out? Huh? Just--just shoot her dead, and Then tell me how you're going To replace her with a better Granny! Okay, well, no, that's not Fair, all right? Ginger would never kill mom. Not with a gun and not with the R.v. But that's what she's saying! That's not what i'm saying! No. What kind of puppy are you Gonna buy to replace granny? He's alive! Bounder's still alive. Let's get him in the r.v. Merciful martin luther, come on. Open the door.

Is that what you're trying to Say? Oh, bonnie, don't be that Way. You can't give in to the Weakness of expressed anger. I've always tried to be kind To you.

Defend me against who? Haven't you ever noticed the Way that people roll their eyes Behind your back? When you brag about your House or your job or your car? Oh, w-why would they roll Their eyes? who? Stop, bonnie, now! Bonnie: i'm tired of it!

I've prayed about it, and even If the vet is of questionable Ethnic origin, bounder is in Good hands and getting the best Possible care. And if he's dead, we'll find a Way to forgive you...because We're christians, and we have To. Bounder's not dead. No. The best i can ascertain, uh, He just, uh-- Bounder fainted. Fainted? Mm-hmm.

So, i--i didn't hit him, And he's not dead? He fainted, like a pussy. You owe me an apology. You want an apology from me? When you almost killed him? If i killed him, i'd Apologize, but i didn't, so... Stu, make her. Make her apologize. I don't think any apologies Are necessary. I think we should just all be Grateful that bounder's okay.
