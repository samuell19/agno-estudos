(Drumroll) (Soft Music) they need a teacher, i need a job. i told them yes. why is it such a big deal to you teaching a bunch of farmers kids? yes i guess it is you're doing it again you're running. no i'm not not from you you're afraid of me you're afraid of everybody (Soft Music) (Bus Door Opening) uh sir are you sure we're in the right place? yeah sure they said somebody would meet me here well i guess they will (Bus Door Closing) (Bus Leaves) do you think it'll change anything? you'll be nowhere you'll be in the middle of nowhere but that's what I want. it's perfect for me it'll be quieter. i have time to figure me out. there's something weird about those people you said yourself they can't keep a teacher well maybe there's something weird about me i guess you want your things back Nah the harmonica? keep it. i'm sorry dave sure goodbye melody i'm sorry you had to wait. the truck kept boiling over scared me what's these mountains sometimes you can't hear the thunder and it's right on top of you i'm karen hi we'll have to make two trips with your bags my truck won't make it down the hill oh well um this one's pretty heavy i think we managed there really isn't much of a road we sort of make it up as we go along is that to keep the people in or out oh yes you've heard about us yes i was told um i warned there's nothing so awful about them though we're a long way from everything no movies or tv mostly we're just quiet people that's fine with me i could use a little peace and quiet your luggage looks well traveled i envy that kind of freedom sometimes it's exciting for a while i may be leaving vendo someday at least that's what valencia says and she's an old one what would you like to do i don't know there's a lot of things we don't know yet there's your schoolhouse oh it's beautiful used to be a church we hauled it piece by piece from jethro that's an old ghost town up north away there's lots of ghost towns around here bendo's the only one that survived that's my friend jeremy he wants to go to college to study about the earth how it was made now i'll just be a minute what a lovely place to live mrs redden loves these trees she puts up the best branded peaches in the valley he'll have some tonight he'll taste joy so miss emerson this is my grandmother and my father soldiers oh yes you're head of the school committee we'll be working together i'll be happy you're in charge of the school do whatever you think is right oh you mean there's no pta the law says to school them nothing else you have a very pretty room with a feather bed and a bath all of your own and my mother is a very good cook i'm afraid not today chickens cooked so long i expect it's tough oh that's all right i'm i'm not hungry uh these are from mrs redden they look delicious wow yes anything from her kitchen is very special she has a real gift for anything she does well karen i expect miss emerson would like to see her room and get settled um i'm afraid

name that's my name okay adventure listen why don't you take off your hat and you can uh you can ring the bell i suppose you parents would like to know something about me i'm i'm not what you would call a by the book school teacher i believe in allowing the children as much freedom as possible so they can learn to well explore and experiment with the world around them and within them not that i'm permissive because i'm not that either it's just that i believe a teacher's job is to help a child discover his inner potentials she's pretty hush up hello melody i'm so glad you come to bender i'm balancing may i stay miss emerson i'd like to watch sure if you want to thank you i guess i got off on the wrong foot you feel very eager don't you yes and not that it isn't my first job of course it's just kind of a new beginning for me it is for us too the way karen talked about you i somehow pictured you sort of well that i'd be older in bendo age and years don't necessarily mean the same thing can i give you some friendly advice yes of course the people in bendo listen very deeply it's best not to speak in the shallows when i was a little girl i used to imagine that i could drink a magic drink and turn into an animal let's just suppose that your apple juice is some of my magic drink well let's take a sip and i don't drink it all because you're gonna have to leave some so you can change back into yourselves and i'd like to know your name and how old you are and what kind of an animal you changed into and what kind of an animal are you a kitty cause kitties are soft and nice to pet and you should let a kitty do what it wants matt fifteen you can stand being a good horse i reckon i'm i'm ken and i'd like to be an otter because they can have fun yeah well i'm frencher almost

up the rules and i got big teeth okay who's next we're not supposed to be tamed i don't think it'll hurt listen i think there's uh something that we all better understand and that there's one teacher in this classroom and that teaches me hey jeremy haven't seen you in a while how you been just fine dr curtis how about you oh i just got over a case of the flu my uh patients are so healthy i have to get sick every once in a while just to make myself feel useful scrap a few pills for myself take my temperature a lot feel better right away so here you are working on a weekend to make up for lost time someone sick inside no that's not a not a house call starting a research project today gonna collect water from all the wells and vendo eventually you think there's something wrong with our water no no no i think there might be something very right with it something that might explain the immunity to certain diseases around here well maybe it's just that we don't travel outside the valley much might be one factor but uh illnesses crop up in even the most isolated communities the only thing that gets sick and bendo are the animals i might as well be a full-time veterinarian instead of a part-time one hey can i can i can i look your horse over for you checking for gout or something oh no thanks he's in fine shape well good luck with your research i'm late for my chores over clarence

i'm surprised that hasn't hit you it did in the spring it's all made up of mash not stopped it you mean you got a cure i think it just stopped well it doesn't just stop saw until the sheep are dead can't do anything about it what do you mean you couldn't do anything about it you go to the agriculture commission you can shoot something wrong there's knees over at the clarence place bethes hurt van i heard her scream she was just doing her chores i think it's be wrong he's coming to your gift i think you're sensitive i'll sort you and you'll remember and it won't ever hurt again do you know what she's condemning this child too she's the oldest not me not you breath is not hurt it's brown rams creating the hill over yonder he's had an accident take care of him and she'll be all right but please hurry this body is in great pain get a shovel hold on his arm has a bad break but he'll be up and around in a few days homer see you later barn so can i give you a lift somewhere didn't have a chance to introduce ourselves in the middle of the crisis but i assumed you were the school teacher i guess it's pretty obvious what i do around here doug curtis uh melody emerson i've after the children talk about you what do you think of bethy symptoms i don't know it's the kind of thing that fascinates me about these people maybe it's kind of a sympathetic reaction i've read about identical twins feeling each other's pain but she and bram aren't even blood relatives i i missed a lot about uh what they were whispering but i heard valencia say that it was a gift anything that puts a child through that much pain is not my idea of a gift don't you find these people a little unnerving i guess depends what you expect from them i came to this area because i was interested in folk medicine i never expected to find a place like bended well i wish i could find vendors intriguing as you do but when it comes to children i find some of their customs just plain um cool well don't don't give up too soon i've learned to respect these people even though i didn't have a foggiest idea what they were doing or why i'm not like that i have to have reasons for respecting people or their customs and i haven't found any reasons yet she's too young the others were too old too sad your grandmother thinks we ought to send her back you won't get another teacher so the children will have to be sent outside for their schooling you know what that means valencia says miss melody will help us valence is wrong she's an old one now father your grandmother is still the oldest this teacher is too young and bright the young ones might get to like her well what would be the harm in that makes it that much easier for them to slip in the name of the present soul they're children a young frencher just yesterday i found him in the woods with bethe and they were remembering oh no maybe it's time father your grandmother decision this time not valencia not you you be sure to stay in that classroom rancher i want to talk to you a minute i don't want to get you in any trouble but i'll teach you how to read music if you like well i reckon if nobody knew can you make music you mean compose no make it oh that that's what it's called composing now i can't do that you think people who do that are okay huh of course they are that's a that's a wonderful thing to do it's a very rare and special gift i reckon you're right what's your gift i don't really have one well everybody has a gift i guess mine's teaching i guess i have a knack for it i think anyway i know i'd love to do it rancher i have something for you it's sort of a present wow for keeps only if you play it if not i want it back see you tomorrow morning at school brancher what's valency's gift i reckon she's got them all ma'am me ah stop it please stop it but i could remember to lisa i could remember the home you can't you never saw it you don't have to it's bad it is not the home was beautiful like the music it was awful then you saw it too so she's scared somebody's coming i heard the music it was beautiful don't stop because of me please fracture's gonna get in trouble oh no he won't not with me he won't we gotta go now i wanna talk to you for a minute i gotta go too just stay here for a minute sit down remember when i gave you the harmonica and we talked about gifts and you said valencia has all of them one of them was sorting and that you wanted to sort bethy yeah obla won't matter what does a disorder do oh you know they fix you when you're mixed up like a psychiatrist no swords go into you mind reading yeah kind of prancer i can help you i think i think i can help everyone you can apprentice you must understand all of that is superstition what is mind reading all of it rancher people can't read other people's minds yeah what about that guy the harmonica guy you had a big fight who told you about that nobody who told you i got it from you you couldn't have and from the music it was all twisted and hurt who knows hmm foreign so don't be afraid please stay stay do you know what happened to me back there i know do you i was hypnotized i felt paralyzed it was terrible it won't ever happen again i promise please don't leave us if that's what you teach your children here i can't stay cause i can't take it if you leave they'll have to go over the hill to school maybe that's what they need to get out of the cemetery or are you afraid they might learn how to laugh or to sing or to simply walk like a normal child they never can be normal are you making them sound deformed can't you see that it's your fear and superstition is deforming them can't you see that the time of fear is ending that's why you were sent but you must have patience and you must face your own fears before you can help us is there something wrong in being afraid of that no you've been afraid of many things very afraid of failure and of wonder and of anything that you couldn't explain away what you're going through is a test of us and of yourself we need you more than ever now i can't teach with my hands time when everything i tell those children is contradicted by care i agree karen should leave but i'll have to convince the others you've shown me what i needed to know what was that that you love teaching more than you fear us a-l-l-i-g-a-t-o-r that's very good marnie now here's a word for everybody to see alligator now here's a very hard word for the red team galaxy franchise would you like to try that one who would like to try galaxy i think i know be very careful before you try it now think uh matt would you keep score for a while i found it on my desk this morning why don't you want to make music anymore because then everybody will think you're different different people are what make the world interesting have you ever heard of a man by the name of henry david thoreau well he was a a a very different sort of man well it's very beautiful what he wrote and someday you should read it for yourself but he said if a man does not keep pace with his companions perhaps it's because he hears a different drummer let him step to the music which he hears however measured or far away did you understand that at all yes ma'am i think so but i don't hear drums much rancher if you knew how many people never feel or hear music in their whole life and you do and you should be very proud of that and you should march to it it's in here me what are you doing here i snuck off it's fun bethe nothing bad happens but you mustn't all other kids do outsider kids and grown-ups and everybody you want to too i can tell it is fun it is come on let's go up to the middle ah i think we better go back no not yet i got more stuff to find out miss anderson says that i'm special i'll tell you you're special too but i'm not you can remember can't you when you make music i can okay i'll make music and you remember i remembered i remembered give it back go faster make it slow down oh rancher go after it yes i don't know if i can oh francia you did it you're missing come on too foreign good morning i'm sorry i was late today we're gonna start an important school project paper monitor five sheets of drawing paper for everyone matt will you pass out the crayons and betty will you close the door now this project is going to be a book a drawing book a picture book and the title of the book is going to be i know there are many wondrous things about the home and i want you to try to draw what you remember but we can it's wrong children my job is to teach you what i think is necessary and today i'm going to teach you that remembering the home is a good thing that is forbidden no not in here and here it's required now everybody get busy all right something wrong aren't you no just don't try like drawing much well i can excuse you on the assignment on one condition and that is if you take your harmonica to the law and provide musical inspiration for everybody else that's drawing just don't go to sleep me uh hmm i needed more than five pages everybody did thank you peppy thank you miss melody you can go now too francia all right later you know i know what i've seen i know what it implies but i don't know anything else not anymore will you tell me these tell it best these flowers are flowing they bloom just one day a year a big day for us when lovers start to hit and that's a twillow and his friend is a son and they speak he called this a tula these were planted on the paths and you could see them at night they lit up and they were good to eat too we were thousands of generations past war serene and fulfilled the home was sweet then before we knew that year the slamman didn't bloom and a ten year old boy received his gift the gift of seeing that's only given when there's need our planet was dying the oldest ones gathered from all over the home and the boy told them what they must do ancient knowledge had to be remembered and the people had to work together as one quickly because there was so little time we were refugees then each ship going in different directions hoping to find another home what happened to the rest of your people there must have been hundreds on those ships thousands come but something went wrong we came into your atmosphere too fast those that could guard away in the live ships but we don't know how many their descendants are scattered still all over the earth you see it was a new land for them too and we thought our gifts would be of service but instead they were looked on with hatred and fear and our people were called miracle workers and witches and when we had our first gathering thanksgiving you might call it the outsiders were invited to share with us the people had known about envy and anger and fear but it had been forgotten i could have been one of those people no not you maybe not in the same way but just as ignorant just as frightened to see no wonder you hit that's why they shuffle they're afraid of lifting it's kind of a protection it was needed i'll go now what do i do now whatever feels right well we've had a very interesting morning and i know that we're gonna have a very interesting afternoon can we draw more pictures no we're not gonna do any more pictures but i want to thank you because they really are the most beautiful pictures i've ever seen fan would you please give me the dictionary without leaving your seat he's too little to do something like that no i'm not watch this that's a very good try fan all right everybody just contain yourselves everybody will get a turn marnie will you come to me please without walking just lift come on i'm scared yes i know but it's all right brancher you're pretty good with the harmonica think you can play the kazoo hmm oh food yes well be still she's merged with furniture i can't separate her unless i can sort her get dr curtis the fastest way you know how there's not not much i can say he's got a broken neck that's a ruptured vertebrae he's losing spinal fluid even if a hospital were available it wouldn't do any good he can't be moved without severing nerves there's no time betty exhibits uh same symptoms as francis but i can't find any physical damage at all when the boy dies i'm afraid she will too and there's nothing i can do there's something you can do valencia valencia can help bethe even if there's no chance for franchise franchi does have a chance if bethe can be sorted she can act as a guide for the doctor old one it is time you must let it be so don't let your fear kill one that is ours one i'm coming into your mind ah there is rest for you valencia's the oldest one now we missed hurry betsy bethe i'm coming in to you listen to me i will help you to remember remember remember remember you will separate yourself from the pain stand away from the pain you see it but you do not feel it stand away from the pain you see the pain but you don't feel it can you hold it by yourself now that's right no no betsy easy i don't know if i can yes you can i'll be here betsy is sorted the operation is possible now so we must have a gathering of the people there is need for their power in the name of the presence we need your help too come join us melody in the name of the presence the people are gathered it started this is the strength of the people what about edema swelling that's what makes it hurt so much the strength of unity unity of purpose unity of mind we are one we are one people how's that is the pain going away yes yes one thought about his heart tell me about his heart one spirit i can breathe tell me about his breathing one love keep him breathing one life and a girl release more light one good it's done (Dramatic Music) hey dr curtis watch me... pretty good huh? yeah, terrific didn't think i'd find you here they've got a gathering today didn't you know yes yes i heard about it i don't feel i belong there why what's the matter i feel more like an outsider now than i did before now that i know their whole story but think of the possibilities beyond the levitation act and the mind reading tricks these people have a wisdom and experience beyond anything we can imagine what do you think the outside world will do with that probably turn bendo into a tourist attraction flying kids on television or maybe they'll massacre them all this time just out of out of fear and jealousy well there are other ways to share that knowledge saldemus made that secret mash of his that mixture cured his sheep he gave me a barrel to take over the hill on condition i wouldn't tell them where it came from i want to get to know these people as best i can to know as much as i can from them and then help them share it without endangering them it really is and they feel a lot of it is because of you do you want to reconsider that invitation yes i can find a dress so you two have been of great service to us... we're obliged (Soft Music) in the name of the presence the people are gathered it has been a long time since we were gathered in joy since our last thanksgiving the wounds from that time were deep but they've had long enough to heal we've learned now this planet can be a place of love as well as a fear we've learned that we need this earth and its people as much as they need us and most of all we have found what we thought would last forever a home (Soft Music)
