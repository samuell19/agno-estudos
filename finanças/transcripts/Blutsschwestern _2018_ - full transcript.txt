LOST ONES Maria? They're waiting. It's now or never. You're bleeding. It's just a paper cut. Let's go. It was a stupid idea. - Are you nuts? I can't play like this. - You've waited so long. I've turned your crappy Bach pages for a whole year, and you know how much I hate classical. Come on. Clothes off. Stop it. Come on. For me. Dinner is served at six. My eldest. Valentin. Carpenter. Journeyman. Maria. The rest of the house is off-limits. He looks hot, right? Lord Jesus, be with us, bless all that you have brought us. Amen. It's been a while since we had a journeyman. Where are you from? The Swabian Alps. Down from the top? From the very top. To get this straight, you'll be put to work here. He's no vagabond. Am I right? The last journeyman was a drunk. Let's eat, it's getting cold. Three weeks. Board and lodging. Then you move on. I can see you. Can't you knock? You picked a dump of a village. Fuckin' Warmbrunn. That bad? Why the earring? I think it's cool. If you make trouble on the road... if you steal... if you can't pay your way... your earring gets ripped out. Do you like me? Look for a boyfriend your own age. The boys in our village are idiots. Thought you weren't one. I was mistaken. And your earring looks gay. And Maria? I knew it. Dream on, princess. She likes you. Stop it. Come on. I need your help. Are you coming? Be a good sister, go help her. What was that? Help out, I can't do everything. You're jealous of me. When I'm gone, you'll have to pitch in. Inge would be proud of you. Maybe they won't accept me. You're the greatest. So, who's done it already? - What? Fucked. Sure. You? Three times. No bullshitting. I'm recording it. Truth or dare? Truth. So, have you done it already? Remember that guy from tenth grade? He had me at the village fair before dropping out. Liar. What about you? Are you telling one of stories again? It's on, let's go. Isn't that your old man? Right, and the slut with the hooters is your mom, right? So perverse. Fucky, fucky. Can you pull in the beam? Pull. The roof's pushing against the joists. You're right. They messed up during construction. The church ceiling used to be here. The white spots are where the plaster was. Planning to replace the crossbeam? Maybe put in a new support beam. Never touch my clothes again! They're practically an invite. - For what? You know exactly what I mean. Think she'd approve of how you look? You love it. Acting like her. Right? What did you say? What do you even want from me? Protect you. May I do that? At least... - I can take care of myself. You're still mad at me, right? What's the matter? I saw you. In the boiler room. And? What were you doing? You hurt yourself. Down there. You were bleeding. I'm on my period. That's why I was bleeding. That's not what I saw. Are you pregnant? From whom then? You wanted to get rid of it. - Nonsense! How could you even think that of me? I'm not pregnant. I don't know what you saw. Whatever you believe isn't true. I don't want you to leave. I can't always stay with you. What did she tell you? She has a boyfriend? Won't you talk to me? MUSIC CONSERVATORY LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE Drop down. - Drop down! Alright! Stop! You were right. OK? - Yeah. St. John Passion, "Lord, Our Master?" It's an awful story. They nail Jesus to the cross, he dies. For all our sins. It's not about his death. What is it about? Forgiveness. It's a Kemper and Son. My grandpa built organs. Wish I had learned how. Come on, let me show you a secret. He'd show me the holy of holies when I was a kid. I don't know. Come on. It's amazing. Never been inside your own organ? Wait here. It's a surprise. Don't be alarmed. Awesome, right? I see how you look at him. Do you see him? I don't see anyone, Dad. Left or right? Like before. Right. You kept it for me. For you. Turn around. Do you like it? Suits you. Leave me alone. You've been acting strange lately. You'd tell me everything, right? Just like you would. This is Mom's. Where did you get it? I found it. He gave it to you. You were at the hut with Johann. So? What were you doing? The fox had dug its den underneath it. I helped him. Set up traps. Want to come up? What do you actually want from me? I thought you're different. Different from whom? All the others. You look like her. I saw the photo. You think about her a lot? Mine took off. With some guy. She didn't give a shit about us. Everyone said it was for the better. As if I was predetermined to have no mother. Do you believe what everyone says? I don't believe in fate. You? I just want to be free. To come and go as I please. Look. It's all in here. Where I've been. Where I want to go. Who I met. It's a travel log, but more of a diary to me. You can draw. It's really good. Don't you want to go back? It's not an examination to me. And there's no work in the Alps, anyway. Couldn't stand it any longer at my dad's. Stay and watch here with me Watch and pray. Watch and pray... Your hands are freezing. Journeymen can't have girlfriends on the road. You better behave! And don't secretly meet the master's daughter. You think I'm old-fashioned? Maybe that's what I like about you. You don't even know me. And I don't need to. Isn't that un-Christian? Quite the contrary. Can we stay like this forever? Leave me alone. Open up, it's me. Please, I want to talk to you. He loves me. He hurts you. He won't touch you as long as he has me. How long already? Talk to someone. Then what? Give me it. It'll stop. I promise. Defend yourself! Don't fight like a girl! You want it too, right? It must be great. Better than anything. Why else would you do it? You have to promise me something. You won't tell anyone. Promise? You have to. Come on. Open it. Or I'm no longer your sister. Say it. I promise. Across the vast blue sea Where the manatees roar Where the mermaids bathe in suds And the waves splash above Where the sharks and whales Bask in the South Seas Where the little penguin... swallows... a shark We waited for you yesterday. Trouble at home? Construction trailer, 9 p.m.? Don't know. Going to bring some? Come on. Because of your sister? She only sticks organ pipes in there. Don't talk about her that way. What's wrong? - Nothing. Carry on. Why are you crying? I'm not. I feel good with you. Why are you lying to me? I'm not lying. When you love someone, you'd do anything for them, right? Would you do something for me? When you move on, will you take me with you? Me and Hannah. What would Johann say about that? Why? Please. You don't even want me. You just want to fuck and run. You always do that? I was so kind to you. We shouldn't see each other again. Why do you want to get rid of me? For Johann, right? He doesn't want you to see me? It's not about you. Get it? Help me then. I can't. You can't... You can't what, huh? Everything. Slow down, OK? Are you totally insane? Get undressed. You can have me now. Or won't you dare? Get lost! I hate you! You can have me now. Or won't you dare? What happened? You need stitches. You think I don't see how you look at me? You think it's my fault. Were you there when it happened? It was dark. I fell. On my way home. Stay still. Then it won't hurt. I'll give you an ointment to prevent inflammation. In the middle of the night. I'm sorry. What happened at last year's village fair... I have a daughter of my own. - Not Maria. I'll talk to her. In the morning. - Thank you. Johann? People are talking. About what? About your journeyman. Talk to me now. Are you jealous? You want me all to yourself. He does it to me. Now you know. He takes care of me. And he loves me. What are you going to do? Say you think I'm a whore. I'll always protect you. You know that, right? Tell them what's wrong. Tell them it's true. Tell what he does to you. Enough. Don't touch me. Hannah, wait. Why don't you just say it was Valentin? Because he's fucking your sister? Because it was Johann! Now you know. He loves her so much that he's sleeping with her. I don't believe a word of it. Why tell me that? Because the whole village will know by tomorrow. What you told me... If you really want to leave, I'll take you with me. You and Hannah. It's too late. I don't want to leave anymore. I've been letting too much slide since Mom passed. There's a boarding school. Some distance will be good for Hannah. I wasn't rejected by the conservatory. I burned the letter. Why? I can't leave her alone with you. Do you want me, Dad? Or more soup? What's this? Have you totally lost it? Get dressed. Come on. Get dressed. Maria's back soon. I don't know what's gotten into you. First in the church... - I saw you two together. What are you trying to say? I'm always with you and Maria. I know what you do together. If your mother was still alive... - But she's dead. If she was alive, would you still fuck Maria? Did she tell you that? It hasn't been easy since Mom passed. But we promised to stick together. You can't just run off. Think I'll let you spread lies about me? You're locking me in? - You can go when the lie is gone. Get away from her. Talk sense into her. She's gone insane and wants to ruin me. What did you tell her? Lies. Nothing but lies. Lying is all you ever do. Let her go. Put it down. If you want to shoot me, you need to aim higher. Here. Or here. I love you. I'm your dad. You hurt me. Every time. If you loved me you wouldn't hurt me. What can I do to make you stay? Nothing. Subtitles Copyright: Way Film Translation, Matthew Way
