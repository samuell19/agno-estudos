[music playing] NARRATOR: Dr. David Banner, Physician, scientist, searching for a way to tap into the hidden strengths that all human have. Then an accidental overdose of gamma radiation alters his body chemistry. And now, when David Banner grows angry or outraged, a startling metamorphosis occurs. THE INCREDIBLE HULK - RETURNS 1988 english SDH sub - ktÂ® The creature is driven by rage and pursued by an investigative reporter. Mr. McGee, don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. [music playing] NARRATOR: David Banner is believed to be dead. And he must let the world. thing that he is dead until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him. [music playing] FEMALE VOICE IN DREAM: David? [music playing] Good boy. Good boy. Ready? Good morning. Good morning. Great. MAGGIE SHAW: Ah, ah, button me. Oh, you got it. Hmm. That tickles. It's supposed to tickle. You smell delicious. Mmm. Mmm. You taste pretty good, too. Come live here with me, David. It only makes sense. I'm here most of the time anyway, aren't I? It's best this way for now, Maggie, believe me. You sound like you're protecting me from something. What can I possibly be protecting you from? The monster in you maybe? - Monster? - Yes. You remember, you told me once that before we met, you'd gone through a long period of selfdestructive behavior. You didn't go into any details, even though I tried all my feminine wiles. Yes, you did. But you called it to your monster, your Mr. Hyde. It's been two years since my Mr. Hyde has shown his ugly face. Why are you concerned now? You were very restless in your sleep again last night. It worries me when you're like that. I feel like I can't do anything to help you. You help me more than I can ever tell you. Try, please. I think I need that too this morning. Okay. I use you, your image, for control. I concentrate on you, as the old song goes, and I make it through. It's a little like AA, I suppose. You get through one nightmare at a time. Oh, it was the same for me after Michael died. But I survived by losing control, by just letting loose. Some things, Maggie, you can't just let loose. Sweetheart, I wasn't meant to lead a lonely widow's life. I had my time. And you were not meant to be alone. Very soon, I'll be certain that what once happened to me without warning will never happen again, ever. And then I will very seriously consider your sinful proposal. [music playing] REPORTER: Mr. Lambert, please, just a couple of questions Mr. Lambert. Mr. Lambert, please. Why a public unveiling of this gamma transponder. Won't security be a problem? Security is only a problem when you try keeping something this big, this important, a secret. Why is the transponder so big Mr. Lambert, so important? Well, it... Zack, it's in all the press packages, Dan, and you know it. The transponder will create a nearly unlimited energy so as by accelerating the decay of gamma radiated material. Now, I'd say that was a big and important advance in the field of scientific endeavor, wouldn't you, Dan? Huh? Come on, little brother. No straggling. [intercom paging Dr. Cascade] This institute is in the business of the future. And that business of the future is science. - I've already heard this sermon. - You know, me too. I am off to biogenetics. Ah. See you for lunch, love? - You got it. - Okay. JOSH LAMBERT: One thing I want to clear up, we are not putting the transponder up for dish as a weapon. ZACK: David. I'm glad you're here. The, uhm... show and tell of the transponder is going to begin in just a few minutes. And Josh would appreciate it very much if you would... And Josh would appreciate if I were to handle the presentation, correct? Well, yes, that's correct. I already said no, Zack, over a week ago. I'm sorry, but the answer is still the same. Well, Mr. Lambert, who is the Lambert scientist responsible for making this discovery? There'll be a press conference at 3 this afternoon. All your questions will be answered at that time. Jim, Weldon. REPORTER: Mr. Lambert, any more information on the site? [intercom paging Professor] You shook your head. I assume that means that you're not going to take the credit, do you? Again, you're not going to stand up there, with you're creation and ah... accept a little applause. It was a team effort. You led the way, and the team knows it. I'm sorry. He's sorry. I have my reasons. What ever kind of trouble you're in, Mr. Banyon, I can help clean it up. I appreciate the offer, Josh, but I don't want you involved. Not involved? David, for God's sake, you've been with this for almost two years. Will... I don't need the publicity. Everything I do need for what I have to do is here. You allow me to use the lab after hours. You pay me very well. Yes, yes,... and there's also the added incentive of Dr. Maggie Shaw, biogeneticist. That's true. That's right. All right. All right. I surrender. When we unveil the transponder, you may hid in the background. As usual. JOSH LAMBERT: Ladies and gentlemen, a miracle in our time and the hope of the future. The gamma transponder and the people responsible. Nearly two years of concentrated research, hard work, the the very real possibility of curing my... my problem seems at last to be here, either a cure... [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] Main lab. MAGGIE SHAW: Mr. Banyon, this is the woman you love. And she's lonely. And she's also a lot softer in all the right places than that transponder of yours. You'll get no argument from me on that score. Now what I have to do, Maggie, won't take long, not long at all. Be safe, love. Yes. [music playing] The breakdown of what I've done to the transponder can be extracted from the computer by using the following access code. Banner DB. None of the changes, that I have mad will in any way diminish the equipments primary function. As a matter of fact, It might even suggest a primary function of their own. [music playing] I've turned the transponder into a kind of giant Chinese puzzle, a puzzle to which only I have the key. And that key is a mechanism located in the laser field rotator which reverses gamma polarity. This reversal will result in a radical mutation in the cells the subject,... myself. And cause complete remission. [music playing] Many things could go wrong in this experiment. And if such does happen, then I request that my notes and my research be made available to the following persons, Dr. Randle Smythe Wilson at Cambridge University, Doctors Richard and Marian Higgins at Berkley, and Dr. Margaret Shaw, head of biogenetics at the Joshua Lambert Institute. [music playing] DONALD BLAKE: You are David Banner, aren't you? If you're not, I'll just apologize profusely and get out of here. Ah, I just couldn't let you zap yourself with that thing until I was sure. Who are you? You had a beard the last time I knew you, ah... Harvard 10 years ago. You were the guest genius at the time. Resident Merlin,and ah... me I was... I was in trouble a lot. Blake? Donald Blake? The one and only. Oh. Look Davide, I don't know why you're not using your real name or why you want people to think you're dead. And I don't care. Well, that's not true really, I'm curious as hell. But I'm not going to ask or try to find out. That's your business. And it's going to stay that way. Thank you. So, what are you now, Don, medicine? No. I haven't practiced since... since I signed on as the team doctor on an ill fated expedition into that vast and frozen wasteland of the savage Norsemen. Ill fated? Yeah. There are other words I could use. Something happened, something I don't understand. Something crazy. Well, tell me. That's why you came here, isn't it? Ah... do you remember I used to have this thing for Viking culture? Ah... a feeling I never quite understood, which is probably why I signed on as the team doctor with this amateur, archaeologist group headed North. But I'm talking way North. [music playing] DONALD BLAKE (VOICEOVER): On the 4th day into the mountains, we ran into a mess of bad weather and hold up. One of the local guides said it was Odin himself, head god of the Vikings trying to blow us back where we'd come from. By that time I almost believed him. In the middle of the night, the storm just stopped. I woke up. It was that feeling again, that sense of being drawn along by something bigger than me, and I followed it alone. I climbed for a long time, not lost at all. It was really strange. I felt as if I knew exactly where I was going. And just after dawn I found it, a cave. [music playing] DONALD BLAKE (VOICEOVER): As I went deeper, I understood why the caves entrance had not been sealed by the ice and snow. Warm volcanic air rose through the passageway from deep within the earth. And the strange world I had found became even stranger. And there was a tall, hand carved stone covered with Viking writing or Runes. And though I wasn't supposed to read them, I could. You have pierced the heart of Odin, they said. Turn and go away or go forward and be eaten by your fate. Very encouraging, right? The perfect reverse psychology. I went forward and came upon the strangest sight of all so far, a tomb carved from stone and covered with more Viking writing. Eerie as hell, but irresistible. [music playing] DONALD BLAKE (VOICEOVER): The Runes told me a little. Who... whoever was inside the sarcophagus had been a great warrior and King. And his name was Thor. DONALD BLAKE: And something else, something dark. This warrior King had been condemned by Odin to never enter Valhalla, the Viking equivalent of Heaven until he had performed a... a number of heroic deeds, kind of a penance for the sin of arrogance. DONALD BLAKE (VOICEOVER): I just had to look inside forgetting everything I'd learned in my crash course on archaeology and forgetting also what happened to the curious cat. [music playing] DONALD BLAKE (VOICEOVER): Inside the granite coffin was the skeleton of a man, a big man and all decked out in ancient armor. At his side was a Viking war hammer, a very serious weapon. When I picked it up, held it in my hands, I realized just how serious. [music playing] DONALD BLAKE (VOICEOVER): Suddenly the cave was filled with thunder. The... the... the stone of the coffin was blown off as if it were made of paper. The hammer vibrated in my hands as if it were alive. It... it was alive. And I...I couldn't let go. [music playing] I knew the whole story then as if I had learned it once and I was now remembering. I don't know how, but I'm part of this guy, This Thor. He's part of me. Yeah. All I have to do is think about what I was like when you knew me. And I wouldn't believe a word of it either. I have to understand something before I can believe it, Don. OK. OK, the closest thing, I can come to an explanation would be what's ah... popularly known as channeling. The spirits of the dead existing again through the living. Right. So this hammer is like a... a... a switch, that turns the channel on. And then, bang! There he is. But... but he's not a ghost or a spirit. He's real. He's as re... he's as real as this... this counter only bigger, and ready to do whatever I ask, as long as it's legal. Heh. Can you imagine having a power like this but in order to use it, it has to be focused on something like a good cause. This is the '80s. I don't know what a good cause is anymore. But he does. It's real clear and simple to him. You talk with him? Yeah. Well, actually he does most of the talking. Drives me nuts. Wants me to be more heroic. Me. I don't know quite how, but I thought that... that maybe you could help me. Maybe finding you, my favorite scientist alive when you're supposed to be dead, um... it's fated or something. All right, all right, now wait... wait a minute, Don. Item,.. you were under tremendous pressure, both physical and mental, when you have this experience. Now, item,... you were in the mountains, extremely high altitude, and oxygen deprivation can cause any number of hallucinatory reactions. David look in the bag. It is old. Is it a hallucination? No but it could be the key to an overall hallucination. You were in the cave. You found the grave and the hammer. - Don, you know as well as I do... - No David, I don't know anymore. I don't know anything anymore. Everything I thought of as... as...as rock solid has turned to sand 'cause of this, 'cause of him. Do you know how many times I've tried to leave this thing behind? Tried to lose it? It... it...it pulls me back like a...a... a chain. I... you're gonna make me do this, aren't ya? - Don, listen, to me... - No, no, David, this is what you want. This is the only way that you're going to believe me. You ready? [thunder rolls] [music playing] You're a century's version of hell, eh, Blake? Is this a hallucination? And this must be Banner the warlock. Well, all in good time. First things first. - What are you doing? - I'm thirsty. What are you doing? I'm thirsty. Don't let him touch those panels. Stop him. He'll wreck everything. Don, make him stop. You maniac, hold it for a second. Drink, is there nothing to drink in this alchemist's den? I seriously doubt it. I must not lose control. David, he do... he... he's harmless. Does he pray? I'm sending you back. Give me that hammer. Wait. I won't hurt him. All right, look, you. Blake says that you are wise in many things. But if you show him how to cut the core that Odin has spun between us... Thor hold it. Or if your witchcraft should harm Blake, then I lose my chance to enter Valhalla. And you have never seen anger. He is praying. - David it's... - Go away! Leave me alone, please. You just don't understand. You don't know what could happen, please. Go away. DONALD BLAKE: Don't push him. Leave you be, eh? - Stop it. - Sounds more like insult than hospitality. - What are you doing, you jerk. - An insult is... - ...something I can always understand. - Don't push him. - Don't make me angry. - He's braver than I thought, Blake. - Stop it, dammit. - Leave me... Ah. [music playing] - Oh, he was spared. - DONALD BLAKE: Good God. [music playing] Roar. Roar. Roar. You're dead. No Thor. That's David. Give me the hammer. Raah. Give me the hammer. THOR: He wants a fight, I'll give him one. Roar. Thor don't. No! Roar! [music playing] THOR: Agh! Roar, roar, roaaaaar! Roaar! This will send you back to hell you ugly troll. Roar! No! Hah. Hah. I think I made him angry. THOR: Odin's beard; for an ugly troll, you're a fighter. I'd be your friend. What do you say? Odin wills it. [sirens] THOR: Friends you and I. Roaar. Roooaaaar. Blake, the hammer. No way. I'll have enough trouble getting out of here myself. The hammer you limp spined rabbit. Save your breath and leave. [sirens] [music playing] Easy Banner. Don't be frightened. I'm here as ally, not enemy. Blake sent me to sniff you out. Gift from Odin this nose of mine, never fails, always find my man. Where is Blake? My master waits in his metal chariot. That way. I'll follow you. Thor found you. He found me, yes. Did you doubt I would? I'm really glad you're OK, David. Everything turned upside down, and I... and I... it's my fault. That's right. I know, but I...I didn't know the mechanics of your problem. I didn't know if... if... if you were going to stay that way or for how long or... I'll explain all this to you later. Let's just get out of here, OK? OK. I suppose I'm leaving now? Good guess. You've caused enough trouble. I found him, didn't I? Watch my lips. Go. The hound returns meekly to be to the kennel of Odin. Fine battle we had, eh, Banner. Me and your troll. Well? Odin. DONALD BLAKE: We made the morning papers, page two. One good thing in our favor, the media is portraying it as a publicity gimmick cooked up by your Mr. Lambert to a... promote the transponder. Yeah, so I see. Police spokesman, Captain Derick Pile minced no words when he called the incident an obvious publicity ploy. Well, we got lucky this time. DONALD BLAKE: Well, at least now I understand why you're dead. - Look David, - I'm taking myself and my problem out of your life permanently. What happened last like wasn't Thor's fault, it was yours, and yours alone. David you're not being fair to me. For two years now, two years, this change of mine hasn't occurred. And do you know why? Because I've stayed away from people like you. People who start trouble and then run away. Well, you're not running away this time, Don. This time you're going to help wipe up the milk that you spilled. Do you understand? Yeah, I understand. DAVID BANNER: How badly was the lab damage? Well, the...the transponder itself wasn't touched, but the computer banks were hit pretty bad. OK, there it is then. We have a lot of work to do and very little time to do it. You'll give me a hand, and then we'll call it even. You can stay at my apartment. Oh, yeah, what about your friend? My friend stays put until I call him. And he goes back when I put him back. The wrath of God in a bottle. Yeah. What are you going to tell the Institute about last night? Well, that I wasn't there and that I left before the ah... incident occurred. This kind of thing has happened to me before. I've always just... ...disappeared. But not this time. The transponder is the closest thing I've come to a cure. So I'm going to take a chance for a normal life. Besides, no one's taking this seriously. this time. ZEKE LAMBERT: Yes, yes, Mark, I know I did, Yes. All right, it was a formal resignation. And I... yeah, yeah, I... I said that. Well, you know, I... I... I said that too. Right. Huh. Did I say that? Ne... Never mind, Mark, listen, listen it's him. I know it's him. I mean it's the Hulk, Mark. Who would know better than I do? I chased him for nearly four years. OK, listen, listen, Mark, supposing, supposing I apologize for that supercilious ...editor. All right, I will sit down and write a sniveling, whimpering, cowering letter of apology to Mr. Foster, if... if he will promise to put me back in harness again. OK, all right. No, I...i will. I will, Mark. Thank you. Now Mark,... I want my full expense account. Nice try, Lambert. Yeah, right. You read the papers? Yeah. The gambit transponder and the brain it created will be worth a fortune. So the you'll do it, take the contact? I need your help here, LeBeau. Yeah, you do. Very well, I'll handle the contract for one third of the percentage. Ah. You're badly out of shape, Lambert. No challenge at all. It's not my game. What is your game, Zachary? Complicated brotherly betrayal or simple revenge? I have my reasons for what I'm doing, LeBeau. They don't have anything to do with our deal. Wrong. They have everything to do with it, everything. I won't push ya, but I'm going to tell you one time. We shake hands on this, we go all the way, no turning back, no cold feet, no sudden religious conversions. Or what? Or what? Or what? Okay. My organization kidnapped the transponder and this David Banyon also within the week for one third percentage of the final sale price or ransom, whichever comes first. We got a deal, Mr. Lambert? Fine. All settled. It's 17 serves 9. Ready? I'm going to win this point, dammit. That's the spirit, Lambert. That's the spirit. You can't win the game unless you'd rather die than lose it. All right, get that panel off of there. OK, come on, move. Here we go. [voice on intercom paging] Come on. [voice on intercom paging] [voice on intercom paging] Well, whatever it was that smashed through this lab, we were extremely lucky. Everything seems repairable. Ah, what really happened here, David? I don't know. I wasn't here. Oh, that's... that's right, I forgot. You were ah... you left the lab early. You had dinner with a friend, and the friend's name was Donald Blake. And Mr. Blake is now helping us repair the damage to the computer. Hard at it too. Nose to the grindstone. Another one. Another what, Zach? Another one like you, David. Another one from nowhere who's ah... very good at what he does, but totally unconnected, alone. Hey, I'm sorry, David. That's always been my big problem, too damn curious. Morning. Third degree, huh? Well, it doesn't matter in a few days. You'll step back in front of the death ray. Life ray for me, I hope. I hope so, too, Dave. I really do. At the same time, I feel kind of jealous, like a... a... like a leper who finds another leper to be pals with. And then his pal goes and gets cured. Well, using your analogy and sticking with it, you're like the leper that causes the disease to happen. Wait a minute, what does that mean, David? Don, Thor only happens when you call him up. And that's the rock bottom truth of it. I have no choice. The creature in me is uncontrollable, but you control Thor. Now, there must be a reason for that. Only you don't want to know what it is. Oh, OK, you might be right. But ah... what do I do then? A... a hypnotic regression to dig up an answer? Why don't you ask Thor? Ask Thor? Yeah. Look, I um... I... I need to take a walk. I need some fresh air. In LA? Ha, ha, ha. Here you go. The hammer's in the apartment. There's a niche, you'll need some keys. All right. [music playing] MR. ELWOOD.: Now, I'm sure that by the time that we're finished with your tour of the Institute, Mr. McGee, you'll have more than enough material for a heck of a story. JACK MCGEE: Well, I certainly hope so, Mr. Elwood, especially since I've been cooling my heels in the hotel for the last 48 hours. It just could be my big story has vamoosed. Company policy, Mr. McGee. I'm sure you can understand, security clearances, et cetera, et cetera. After all, we do quite a bit of government work here. You do... But had a little security problem, though, a few nights ago didn't you, in your main lab. - Simple vandalism. - Vandalism? Heh. A couple of things that witnesses described as monsters and giants having it out on the roof? A journalist, of all people, Mr. McGee, should know how unreliable witnesses are doing a chaotic incident. The lab had been used earlier in the evening by a technician named Banyon, D. Banyon. You suppose I could talk to this guy, Banyon? If you'll just come with me, Mr. McGee, I'll show you our biogenetic department. And I'm sure you'll find it much more interesting than Mr. Banyon. Thanks for everything, Dr. Shaw. I know Mr. McGee appreciates it. Oh, my pleasure. Mr. McGee, it was nice to meet you. Nice meeting you, Dr. Shaw. Thanks again for the fascinating demonstration. Oh, David. Da.... [music playing] Oh. [thunder rolls] DONALD BLAKE: Odin. Thank you, Odin. Hold it, big fella. I need some answers from you. I want to ask you some questions. You want, you need. I want a drink. Mead. Or what you call beer will do. It's thin stuff, but it's better than nothing at all. And food. My stomach is twisted around my spine. I want it full. Food later, questions now, OK? OK. David, that man you met. The troll I fought, you mean. Oh, could he fight. Yeah, that part of him can fight. The other part of him can fake. Now how do you think those qualities are divided between you and I, you Buick on stilts? That's an insult isn't it? Ah, yeah, that... that... could be considered an insult. Heh, heh, ha, ha. Blake, you have courage and wit. Oh. Now, there is a part of you I like. Odin knows why. DONALD BLAKE: Yeah, Odin. That's what I want to talk to you about. Why are we... THOR: Do you what it is like to be without flesh, Blake? No I don't. Without flesh that you can feel, without blood pumping through your limbs, with no heart and no chest to hold it. And Still, at the same time to be awake, not sleeping, not dead, not anything. A place of mist and smoke, darkness, alone, as if in some terrible dream. And then, then Blake, to hear the call. It was like a war horn in battle. And then, to awaken as you were, when men and women ate life with shining teeth. None of them are left now. But I am what I always will be. And I need to drink, eat, laugh with a woman, fight with a man, just a taste, Blake, and then... then you can ask questions until Odin's missing eye returns. I... I didn't... I never thought about it that way. I didn't... I didn't begin to know what it was like. I... I didn't know. But still how are we... How? why? How am I here now? Thor, you actually have a point there. Odin made you my guide in this place, and for humility's sake, I must follow your lead. Well, then lead. Food? Drink? Women? And the company of men like yourself. I think I know just the place. [music playing] Hi. [music playing] Ooh. Ow. BIKER: Man, you are one of a kind, Thor. You can ride with us anytime. So long buddy. You're the best, Thor. See you later. BIKER GIRL: So long handsome. You've done me a service, Blake. I won't forget it. Now, ask me your questions, Blake. Ask me anything. Can you drive my car? By Odin, I could try. Um... no, never mind, forget it. I'm crazy. ah... We'll... we'll just take a cab. Your questions, Blake. One schooner of beer and I'm wasted. I have not constitution. But you, on the other hand, have a hell of a constitution. You're basically a... a good dude, dude. A nice guy, who just happens to enjoy pounding evildoers into oblivion. But does... does... does... does that make you a bad person? No, a little dramatic. I mean, hah, punish the bad people who hurt the good people. That's what I say. Get'em fire and brownstone. THOR: That's why Odin made you my guide in this place. But it's more than that. You may not much of a man. Well, ho... But you have a good brain, and a wide heart. You're also skilled as a healer. - Well, that's true. - Oh, I like you, Blake. - Well, thanks. - But only when you're asleep. It's a joke. The angry one, the one I fought in there, he told me that. Ah, it's a joke. It's hilarious. Hey, cab. Hey, cab. [tires screech] That's good. That's good. THOR: Oh, Blake, I could learn to like this world of yours. It's not that different really. Of course you let criminals to run loose. And no one has the courage to do anything about it. But people can learn to stop being insect, by Odin. JACK LEBEAU: Don't let me down on this, Fouche. Get the machine and the man who made it, Banyon. D. Banyon. MIKE FOUCHE: Hey, no problem. What could stop us? JACK LEBEAU (ON PHONE): Just get Banyon. Mariner Two, this is the alpha leader, over. ALPHA TWO: This is two. Go, alpha leader. What be going on? ALPHA TWO: The target's still in main lab. A lot of security. ALPHA TWO: No change, piece of cake. RAIDER ONE: Raider one to alpha leader. Talk to me raider one. ALPHA ONE: We got communication to and from the target terminated. Hey, that be good, 10 4. We outta here, we gone. Bye. ALPHA ONE: Roger, out. [music playing] [beeps and computer test noises] [music playing] MIKE FOUCHE: Evenin' Officer. [music playing] I was just coming up to check on you, Mr. Banyon. The phone's are down. Something's up. I can feel it. Your feelings are right. Come on, Roy. Who in the hell are you guys? Where's Burke and Summers? Maybe asleep. Very peacefully. Turn around. Put your hands behind your head. The luck be good, it's himself. Yeah, your lucks about to go sour. I mean, you people don't know who you're pickin' on here, buddy. - There's no one you can push around, man. - Roy, don't do this. I tell you there's going to be more cops here... Shut up or you're gonna die! [gun shot with silencer] Ahhh. What is that? Run, look out. [music playing] Roar. MIKE FOUCHE: Oh, get away from me. Roaaar. [music playing] [dog barking] [music playing] David? Is that you? David? David? David! [music playing] - JACK LEBEAU: Let me get this straight - OK. Crystal clear. A big green man, Fouche. Is this what I'm hearing? A big green man prevented you from accomplishing your mission? We can't be sure what we saw even was a man. But it was big, correct, and green? A big green thing? I can only tell you what we done seen, Jack. He's tellin' the truth, Jack. What he's sayin' is true. Get outta here, Bonner. Tell the rest of the men to relax. And get rid of that truck. Meeting tomorrow at 7. Move it. If there was someone else I could find at this short notice, then I'd do it, Mike. Then I'd get rid of you, personally with pleasure. You got no cause to speak to me like that, Jack. Else mean to do what you say. It don't be fair. It don't be fair. You stupid Cajun idiot! Hey, you just as Cajun as me, man. This is not blood we're talking about, Mike. This is a contract, money, big money. Lost the element of surprise. They're going to throw a wall of security up around the transponder. Impossible to pierce. Banyon's lady, she's now the key. [waves crashing] BRUCE BANNER: Maggie, hang on, a little longer, please. There is hope for us. But it all depends on something that I have to do in the next few days. And if it turns out all right, then we can be together. And everything will be as it was before all this happened. I'm not a child, David. I... I...I can't just accept something without knowing what it is that I'm accepting. Before all this happened, you said. Please, please, tell me what happened. Look, Don's going to be here any minute. Don. This all started when Don arrived. Don has something to do with this, doesn't he? Oh, David, what are you hiding from? What could be so terrible that you would do this to us? [music playing] MIKE FOUCHE: Give me that tranquilizing gun. JACK LEBEAU: Move it, move it. Wait inside. [music playing] BRUCE BANNER: I've got the dart, Maggie. I've got it. Come on. [music playing] OK, big boy, do your stuff. Odin! Keep climbing, Maggie, come on. [music playing] Odin! [music playing] Rooaaar. JACK LEBEAU: Get him. [music playing] Ah. Ah ah. [gun shots and music] Ah, hah, hah, hah, hah. Ha, ha, ha , ha, Hah, hah. Good work, Blake. Follow me. Let's go. Come on. [gun shots] [music playing] Get out of here. Let's go, go. He has Banner's woman. Come on. Now. Roaaar. [music playing] What's goin' on? Come on, shake him off. [music playing] No! [music playing] That's it, shake'em off. No! [music playing] - Roooaaar. - THOR: You jackal. [music playing] - Roar. - Agh. POLICE OFFICER: We have reports of a helicopter assault, Captain Goodings, by uniformed police. CAPTAIN GOODINGS: None of that's been confirmed yet. REPORTER: Is there any truth to the story that a witness against the mob was being protected here by federal agents? No truth to it at all. Now, please gentlemen, and ladies, you have to allow us to do our work. And when that work is completed, we'll provide you with all the pertinent information. Who was living here, Captain? Sergeant Lindsay, take over. Yes Sir. Now the house is owned by a Dr. Margaret Shaw. Dr. Shaw is head of biogenetics at the Joshua Lambert Institute. Isn't that where ah... witnesses reported seeing a green monster of some kind? Those witnesses observed something at an extreme distance and cannot be considered reliable. Yeah, well, I've got the names here of eight residents who live not one mile from this place, all of whom claim that they've observed the same creature today. Just who the hell are you Mister? They said, he was running down the beach that away with a Viking and an unidentified individual in hot pursuit of the green monster. Now all of these people told me that they'd already spoken to the police. So you must have some idea of what I am talking about, haven't you Officer? No, I really don't. - I really can't comment on that. - Officer,.. officer... Now please. I can't give you any further information about that. - Sergeant we need some confirmation. - No, really, I can't. No comment. REPORTER: What's all the secrecy about? What isn't the police department telling us? What do we have on this Banyon guy she was seeing? OFFICER: Well, all we know is a... he worked with her at this Joshua Lambert Institute. SERGEANT: Absolutely nothing. Now I... that's the last word. That's my last word. It's Banyon, D. Banyon, works for Lambert Institute. I need a home address. After the attempt at the Institute, I should have known what they'd try next. I should have known. What happened to Maggie is my fault. David, stop beating up on yourself, OK? Otherwise your big green friend will return, and everything will go to hell. Look, I don't want to sound coldblooded, but logically speaking, it's not profitable for them to her Maggie. Until they get what they want, maybe, but afterwards? They'll make a call. They'll want to make a trade. When they tell us what they want and where the trade will be, then we'll know what to do. What we'll do is attack them. Singing to Odin for a warrior's death. And then we'll squash the cowardly dogs that would wage war on a woman. Don't fret, Banner. Your woman will come to no harm. Can't you put him back in his bottle? I got a feeling we're going to need the guy, David. I, Thor, son of Odin, swear it to you. That... that shower bath is a miracle. Water from nowhere. It's wonderful, hot and cold, all you could want. I tell you, the eyes would pop from my old comrade's head if they could see what I'm seeing in this godforsaken world of yours. Ha. However, it does have its good points. What is it? Trouble. Trouble? What is it that you pounded on my door with such insolence? Ins... no, I... I... I ... I'm ah, ha... looking for a man, who I... You have found one. Ah, ah... yeah, but this is a particular man. Oh, I am a particular man. - He's Name is ah... - Especially about those I speak with. - It's a... - And I do not like your face. - A D. Banyon. - You look like a rat tailed saxon to me - ...or a thieving Kelt. - Well, I... I just came up looking for this Banyon. Well, then you have found him mush spine. I am Banyon. Yo... you're Banyon? Ah... well, I... don't ah... I... I... this must be another Banyon that I'm... Uhm... I'm... I'm sorry to have bothered you. Ha...ha... have a nice day. Ah, ha, ha, ha. I'm learning to be subtle. The enemy retreats with nary a blow struck. Yeah, real subtle. THOR: We will win the day, Banner. Do not fear. Odin is with us. We will save her. [phone rings] Hello? This is David Banyon. Yes, I'm listening. I understand. Yes, yes, I have it. May I speak to her please, just to know that she's... They wouldn't even let you talk to her. Ah. It's that machine of yours, isn't it,they want? Yes. Then they would have to have an inside man at Lambert institute in order to know just how much you're involved. Yes. They've given me 24 hours at which time I have to call this number. By then, they expect me to figure out a way of delivering the transponder into their hands. Are you going to do what they're asking? I can't. You more than most understand what a terrible weapon this transponder could be. David, Maggie understands that also. OK, so what's our next move? I have to disassemble everything. Erase all the computer information. And then set up this socalled delivery with these people and try to free Maggie without anyone getting hurt. We'll free your woman, Banner. I've sworn to Odin on that score but not without anyone getting hurt, not this day. [music playing] That wasn't part of the deal, LeBeau, not kidnapping Dr. Shaw. How many times we heard that chicken song, huh, Mike. That wasn't part of the deal. We're fulfilling our contract with you, Mr. Lambert, nothing more, nothing less. That be right, Jack. You worry me, Zachary, and that's the truth. You sound like a man ready to terminate a contract, not the kind of individual we like to do business with. MIKE FOUCHE: That be so true. They act so tough when they first hire us, then they fall apart. Peace of mind is for the dead, my friend. I guarantee. Well, I mean, I'm not falling apart. It's just that you took me by surprise, that's all. Ah... you can certainly understand my reaction. She's a friend. Ah,... your friend won't be harmed. Why, she's vital to the trade we've made with Banyon. Well, I see, that's... that's different story altogether. I understand. We're in agreement? To understanding among partners. Well, uh... I should be getting back before I'm missed. I will be in touch of course. [music playing] Well? Yeah. Take Bonner, don't mess it up. [music playing] DONALD BLAKE: You know, forcing a computer to forget what its learned, it seems somehow blasphemous. DAVID BANNER: I know. DONALD BLAKE: What? You want to go back? Call me when there is war to wage, demons to fight, but this science of yours turns my guts to water. Do I have your permission to leave? OK. If you want to go, go. Farewell. Farewell. Odin. Well, at least your Mr. Hyde can be reasonable, even likable. Yeah, he's OK, sometimes. Well, with this the transponder is useless at either polarity, 1,100 pounds of electronic junk. Wait a minute, David. This thing can cure you and you're going to fry it? David, come on, let's do the experiment. The repair work to the computer isn't complete. There's just not enough time. So, for me it's back to square one. [music playing] [phone rings] Main lab, Don Blake. Yeah,he's right here. Yeah. Uh... Yeah, OK, I'll tell him. What is it? Zach Lambert's been shot. He's at Queen of Angels ICU. And he's asking to see you. The inside man. [music playing] Classic case, the younger brother st... stabs older brother... in the back. Classic. Zach, Zach, where are they holding Maggie? Nothing of my own. Can you hear me, Zach? Josh gave me everything, roof over my head, clothes, everything. Wanted something for me. Wanted something for myself, hurt Josh same time. David. I'm here, Zach. The old Hamlin Foundry. Ah... Ontario, help her. Thank you, Zach. Thank you. Maybe we better notify the police. There's still time. David, who would you prefer to be on our side? Thor or a bunch of trigger happy deputies? I'm not sure. OK, all right, Thor. MIKE FOUCHE: Hey Silva, Williams, get your tail in here. OK. Odin. Shhh. Splendid places you bring me to, Blake. This isn't a date. Only two? This will be easy. There's five more in the office. Even better. I could use the exercise. Maggie's in there too, big fella. Well, our strategy is simple. You two will attack the front while I engage these weasels from the rear. Then we'll crush them in between, eh? What do you say? It's a wonderful plan, isn't it? - Simple but effective. - Wait a minute. David and I attack from the front? He and I? Well, after you turn yourself into that green troll of course. I don't do that deliberately. Wait, someone comes. My God, it's Josh Lambert. - I'll try and stop him. - I can stop him, Banner. Not that way. Wait here. - Get out of the way, David. - You've got to leave, Josh. They killed, Zach. They've got Maggie in there, and they'll kill her if you try anything like this. - They murdered him, damn you. - Josh, you've got to leave. I... I know how you feel. But you just can't do this. You think I'm responsible, don't you. You think Zach would be alive today if I'd thought about his feelings as a man, huh? Well, it wasn't me. It was them. They corrupted him, and then they destroyed him. Josh, the gun, Josh. Give it to me. Want the gun? Here you can have it. - Aaah! - Take it. [music playing] Roaaar! [music playing] Check it out. Zuke. Go. [music playing] Ah. I knew he thought it was a good plan. Come on, troll. [gun shots] Over here, you dogs. Here I am. Hold it you dumb blonde, they have guns. And we have the right and the might. This will do. [gun shots] [music playing] Haw hah, hah. Aaah. [gun shots and music] MIKE FOUCHE: Agh. Jack, I'm hit. [music playing] [gun shots and music] THOR: You'll be a hero, yet, Blake. [music playing] Watch out for the... the car. [music playing] Ah, Hah, hah, hah. Roaaar. [music playing] Roooaaaar. JACK LEBEAU: Who the hell are you? Why are you doing this? All right, you can die just like anybody else. [music playing] Good work, troll. Hah, hah, hah. Roaaar. [sirens] No wait. I'll keep him safe. Good fight, eh, Blake? DONALD BLAKE: Yeah, yeah, good fight. I think that you'll have to play the hero, Don. Because neither of us can ever say anything about those two other persons can we? No we can't Sorry. And I'll never know everything, will I? You ah... not likely. [music playing] JACK MCGEE: Yeah, yeah, I'm there now. No, he's not. He's gone. He's moved. I...I don't know where. MARK (ON PHONE): Ah, the Hulk's gone into the blue again and so has his Viking partner, geez, I'm really broke up about that, McGee. Boy, we almost had the story of the decade. Yeah, OK, that's very cute, Mark. It's very funny. However, it does not alter what I know to be true. It didn't really hit me till a lot later, but this guy has got to be the same guy all those witnesses saw after that beach attack on ah... Dr. Shaw's place. There's a connection here somewhere. MARK (ON PHONE): The only connection is a loose one, McGee, and it's located between your ears. The Hulk was bad enough. He sold a lot of papers, didn't he? MARK (ON PHONE): But now we've got Ragnar the Viking playing pattycakes with a gang of mercenaries. Mark, I have got sworn statements from a dozen witnesses from Mr. Josh Lambert, all the way down the line. MARK (ON PHONE): Now, I don't care if you've got a declaration of veracity from the angel Gabriel himself. I'm not running these bonehead stories anymore. You read me, McGee? No more. Go to the Journal if you want to file on this junk. Yeah, all right, OK, fine. When I get to the bottom of this, and I will, it is going to give me great pleasure to hear you beg, beg, to print this junk. [waves crashing] Well, you haven't had him out of the bag since you helped me move out of the apartment. What's the occasion? Well, I thought he could use a little exercise, you know? Oh, yeah. So when are you leaving? Today. What about you? That McGee character has been all over the area. Yeah, I know. I'm pushing my luck, but it's difficult. I know you haven't told her, David, but... I think she knows and understands. Look at him. He lives for every second, to hell with tomorrow. Not a worry in the world. The worry he leaves to me. I guess we could all learn something from the big goof. You sound like a man whose made piece with himself and his new partner. Yeah, Thor and I are part of each other. Huh. Well, I'm going to get going before Maggie gets back. I really hate big goodbyes with people I like. So I'm going to collect Mr. Big and hit the road. Well, she's very attractive. He won't like that. What else is new? Good luck. I told you we'd win the day, Banner. Odin willed it. You're probably right. Of course I'm right. Heh, heh, heh. Farewell. When the troll's upon you, you're a mighty fighter. You're not bad yourself. I know. Ah. Call me soon, Blake. Yeah, right. I hate when he does that. [music playing] DONALD BLAKE: Odin. You be good to yourself, my friend. You too and ah... thanks again. MAGGIE SHAW: I miss, Don. DAVID BANNER: So do I. He certainly could live up a party. MAGGIE SHAW: I don't need anything livelier than this tonight. This is just fine. I feel the same. [music playing] I'll always love you. And I'll always love you. [music playing] [theme song] [dog barks] Hush. Hush now. It's no use. He's gone. [theme song]
