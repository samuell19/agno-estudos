A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Funny how nothing was as it seemed. The universe had set its own plan in motion. Yet, like idiots, we thought we were in charge. I get it now. We didn't know anything about love. It's just here... Hey! Okay, it's really them this time! Thanks for driving. Have a good night. Are you shivering? Yeah. I don't really feel cold, but I guess I still am. It hits afterwards. Let's go get you warmed up. No, you don't need to. I mean, you can come in, although I don't know how I'll get in myself. I'll help you. Okay. Wow, that's great. Thank you. Come in. What's wrong with me? - What's that? - Brandy. It'll warm you up. I had enough at the concert, but... It's been 15 minutes, and he's still inside. Must've happened, right? I wonder what they're doing in there. There she is! She closed the blinds! I know what that means! We actually fucking pulled it off! Yes! Yes, we did it! We did it. We... We should check on them. Mission accomplished. Don't get too excited just yet. Is that love? Is it a done deal if they sleep together? You want to be with the person you're in love with. You know, physically. You mean getting laid? Can we not call it getting laid? You guys always treat it like a sport. Always worried about how to score. Making love doesn't have to be like that. Sometimes you see into someone's soul. So you think it's not just about sex? It's not. What the fuck you do that for? Get out. You're kidding me. Yeah, go. I'll let you guys know what's up with them later. "You guys"? Please leave. My parents will be back soon. They'll get the wrong idea. You're right. Don't want to get the wrong idea. Mm. It's hot! - But it's good. - Feel better? Yeah. See, I'm not shivering. Or am I? - You are. - I am. - How about some işkembe? - Dude, you have the worst taste. - What? I'm hungry, let's eat. - I can't. It's already late. - My mom will get mad. - I'll get some. - I'll walk Işık home. Enjoy your meal. - All right. Hey, can I have an işkembe? I'll have it with a tray, please. Wouldn't it be so nice if they actually end up together? Ms. Distas really deserves happiness. Yeah, she does. - Sinan, I have something to ask. - Shoot. Does it break your heart to not live with your parents anymore? - No. - Why not? - Just doesn't. - But why not? I mean, I can't imagine not living with my parents. - It'll be different when I go to college... - Not for me. I'm totally fine. Are you really mad at them? You can't really expect that much from people, you know? Sometimes people suck. It's not a big deal. Seems like you're trying to protect yourself by distancing from everyone. And I think you're incredibly naive about everything. Being a good person doesn't make me an idiot, understand? - I know when you're insulting me... - That's not what I said. - I never called you an idiot. - Sinan, you think everyone is an idiot. - Not everyone, the majority. - Except for you, right? You think you're so smart you think you can know someone by looking at them. I'm smart enough to know that you can't judge anyone. Anyone who thinks they can make judgments is a complete moron, you know? Yeah, I got it. Okay? - Are you going to walk home? - Yes, I am. It's cold. Here, take my scarf. Oh, Sinan, come on. Good night. See ya. It's because you're one of their first memories. Because that's... Hold on. We are part of their early memories. I try to show them the world is a good place, you know? You think that's true? I mean, it is a good place. Don't you think? I think so. I don't know. Maybe... I want it to be a good place. Because, honestly, it would be horrible to go through life thinking something else. - Oh, I'm not making sense right now, am I? - Mm-mmm. I feel like I'm not making sense. I don't even really know the kids, and it would be nice to truly get to know them, you know? But we don't get the opportunity. I know Eda, of course. I love seeing their eyes light up when they learn something brand new. But I also see their anxiety about life. - You should get some sleep. - Oh, no. I don't want to go to bed right now. I just want to sit here talking till morning. I don't ever wanna leave this couch. Why the hell did you come here? Why now? Because it's absolutely the worst timing. I'm leaving. I mean, I'm leaving. One thing. Don't let them kick the kids out after I'm gone, okay? Don't let them. They're not bad kids. Believe me. They're not that bad. Don't leave. Please don't. - All right, I won't. - Promise? Promise. Mmm. - Kerem! - Just let him go to bed. He just walked in. He thinks he can sneak by. Not even a hello? - Our son has graced us with his presence. - What happened to his lip? - He must've had a fight again. - So what happened? Huh? He got kicked off the basketball team and out of his club. Now he wanders the streets. Where have you been? - Had things to do. - Is that so? "Things to do." As if he's running a company. - "Things to do." - Kerem... He's a very busy man, my son. I have to say. Why don't you come sit with us? We can find out what you're up to. Sit down. Come and tell us what you think you're gonna do with your life. He refuses to get a job. Why would he? Kenan Öz' son. Why get a job? Early retirement, right? Bury your father, waste your inheritance, huh? Great plan. Good night. ♪ Above of the clouds ♪ ♪ I left myself from there ♪ ♪ Without thinking the end ♪ ♪ When emotions surround me ♪ ♪ I held your hands secretly ♪ ♪ I looked to your face gently ♪ ♪ Your eyes whispered, oh ♪ ♪ Happiness slowly ♪ ♪ Your eyes whispered, oh ♪ ♪ Happiness slowly ♪ ♪ Smell of the flowers ♪ ♪ The song of the waves Whisper of the wind ♪ ♪ One for you... ♪ - Good morning. - Hey there. - Tea? - Sure. - Can I help you? - Okay. - Been to Bordeaux? - Yeah, with some friends. It's an amazing city. Wine, cheese. First visit was for an away game with the team. Then I went again in the summer, just to enjoy the place. I can't believe that you bought them at the corner. I mean, I would eat there every single day. They reminded me of these amazing cinnamon pastries that I had once. I only had them in Paris, but I've never forgotten. It's a blend of cinnamon and chocolate. Mm. Isn't it great when you find a new flavor? Don't you think so? Oh, sorry, what was the question? I was saying, isn't it perfect when you suddenly discover a new flavor... - when you least expect it? - It is. It's always great when something surprises you. Um... Oh! - Stop, stop, don't touch it. - No, I'll get it. Stop. Let me see. - It's fine. I-I got it. Just wait here. - No, come on. - Come this way. - It's fine. It's not a deep cut. We'll put a bandage on it, and you'll be fine. - Thank you. I got it. - We should wash it out. - I can do it... - Stop acting like a child. - I'm telling you... - Okay, enough! I'll go, then. Sinan? I didn't know you were home. I'm just here for the china set. Nihal has been eyeing it. Poor thing. Yeah, poor thing. Thank you. Guess I'll take these later. See you soon. Any word about our lovebirds? We know he spent the night there. They're adults, so I'm sure they boned. Kerem, do you have to be so crude and say it like that? Maybe they just talked all night until the sun rose, sharing their life stories with each other. And that's it. Or they banged all night. Eda told us everything. We pulled it off. So what I did was spend a little of my own money to buy this lovely gift on behalf of Mr. Altuna. Osman, this is a gorgeous bracelet! - Right? - You really have great taste. Hm. Anyone who has the chance to go out with you is such a lucky girl. So nice. Are we sure he spent the night at her place? We are. We started a beautiful thing. I think we should be proud of ourselves. I know, I am. Pimping out the gym teacher really worked for us. Hey, here they come! Mr. Altuna's not with her. Ah, there he is. Coming behind her. - Shouldn't they be walking in together? - You'd think, yeah. Come on, don't be so negative. Maybe they had things to do, so they came in separately. Or, I don't know, maybe they don't want to be seen together. What the... - Let me look at it in class. - What happened? Those two did not fuck. I mean, that's not the look of two people who've seen each other naked. What are you, a sex professor? Oh, is that who I am? Why don't you just leave it. Don't worry. I'll leave it. Are you sure about that, Eda? I mean, maybe they had a really wild night and because of that they're just feeling embarrassed. Or maybe they're having an illicit affair. Honey, no one's that shy at the beginning of a relationship. Eat, talk, sex it up. Live life to the fullest. I think you have no idea what you're talking about. You seem like the kind of person who runs away when it gets serious. Guys, can you shut up two minutes? Karakis. - Good morning, devil's spawn. - Good morning. Morning. It's over. I can't wait to kick you out of this school. I only have one month until this year is over. Your favorite teacher won't be here next year. And that's when I'll... Işık? My dear girl, what are you doing with these delinquents? Come on. You should be hanging out with your decent friends. - Stay away from these losers. - But, sir, the thing is... He's absolutely right. You shouldn't hang out with losers. We eat human flesh, you know. We might eat you. Sinan... Damn you. I'll throw you out on your ass. I'll do it for the sake of humanity. - My place in heaven will be secure then. - Oh, don't say that, sir. I want to graduate from high school and become a principal just like you did. And then I can wear the same suit every day, expect nothing from myself, and oppress 17-year-old kids, just like you. I'm gonna kick you out. I'm going to kick you all out. Even if I have to work overtime every day to make it happen. Sociopaths! - Well done, man! - Dude, you buried him alive. "The same suit"? That was so good. Pretty boring here, right? I totally understand. They get on my nerves, as well. So, let me be quick. You and me. Let's have fun. No strings attached. Hm? I have class. Hey, watch it! Good morning. They're taking pictures for the yearbook after school today. So don't rush off. Let's go there together. Hold on. We don't even know if we're graduating. I don't know if you care or not, but we're fucked. Don't assume the worst yet. Besides, what does that have to do with anything? They shoot all three grades today. You missed it last year. You might as well go this year. It'll be fun. The yearbook is just a way of trying to create a history where your worst... For God's sake, dude, just say yes. Don't get philosophical on me. - Işık, we'll be there, okay? - Awesome! Yay! Kerem, what happened to your lip? Did you get in a fight again? - It was a stupid cat. - Looks more like a tiger to me. Something like that. All right, everyone. Come on, put away your books. Time for the exam. Vederan, Murak, Nadiya. Kids, put it away. Everything off your desks except your pen and paper. Nothing on your desks. - Take one, please, and pass them down. - You studied, right? - No, why would I? - Why not? He gave us the topic to study over the weekend. I didn't feel like studying. So what are you going to do about the exam? I'll turn it in blank. Don't be dramatic. Why would you do this to yourself, Sinan? Silence. - Hey, Sinan! Are you having a good nap? - I am. I don't believe this. What are you doing? Işık? Işık? Işık! Hey! What's going on? - This isn't like you. - Sorry, sir, I just couldn't study. We're off to Afacan to grab a bite. Wanna come with us? - No, thanks. I'm not hungry. - All right. See you later then. I'll have some spinach with yogurt on the side. What's up? - What do you think about Kemal? - Not much. I hope he'll be a good coach and the kids like him. Oh, please. Come on. He and I have a thing. What do you mean? Ah, well, we might just cause a scandal by the end of the year. He can't take his eyes off me. He's really into me. It's gonna happen. You'll see. Here you go. Oh, if you're not gonna take the last plate, I will. No, I'll take it. If you'll excuse me. I'll take that. Thank you. Oh, Mr. Altuna. There you are. What a pleasure to see you. Enjoy your meal. I expect you to come out with us from now on. Everyone, bon appétit. I'm in. Excuse me? I'm saying I'm in. Let's have a good time. Let's go on a date. Thanks, Habibi. You're something else, man. - Can't believe you pulled this off. - Of course! DON'T STEP ON THE GRASS Aren't you going to eat, Eda? - At least have a sandwich. - I told you I'm fine. But why would you starve yourself? You never eat anything. Can't be good for you. Some things come at a price, sweetheart. Let her starve to death. Delicious, right? Dude, I should've ordered two of them. So fucking good. Hey, you're going to have your picture taken after school, right? Ugh. Enough with this already. All right. We'll be there. But what are we gonna do about Ms. Distas? I don't fucking know. We're so screwed. I don't see it that way at all. They obviously like each other. She's just not very intuitive. Last night, she was probably shy or caught off guard. I wouldn't say there's no hope. So you're saying just because she ran away once, we should give her a second chance. Right? That's not what I was saying at all. Tell me what you are saying, then. I'm completely lost. Is there something there? "Is there something there?" That's the question we have to answer. Two people fall in love, and they try to figure it out. So, is there something? I'm sure there has to be! Come on, guys, let's make a plan, and make it happen. Please, we have to. I think we should make them go to the movies together. That way, they'll get swept away by the magic on screen. - Maybe Casablanca is playing somewhere. - What are you trying to do? - What do you mean? - What the hell? Our friend here has delusions of glory. She passed in her exam with my name on it. She's trying to save me. It's not enough to keep us in school. She's gonna have us graduating with honors. I don't need your fucking pity. - What's the problem? She did you a favor. - Shut up and stay out of this. - Watch it, you asshole! - Why? It's bullshit. Why do people do favors? To feel good about themselves? She can go help children in Africa. But don't use me for emotional masturbation. You guys watch too many movies. We're nothing to her. Okay, Sinan, fuck off! She did something nice. What's wrong with that? I don't want it! I don't need her fucking help! Are you listening to me? Nothing! I don't need a single thing from you! - Don't even talk to me! - Shove it up your ass! - Fuck you! - Hey, calm down! - I'm gonna fuck you up! - Hey, stop! Why the fuck should I, huh? I'm sick of him and all of his shit. I can't tell what anyone wants. Then go fuck yourself! Fuck off, all right? You can all eat a dick. It's not like we're actually friends. Those two are a fucking disaster. Why are we even trying? You're right. It's a waste of time. If it's not working, it's not working. You think so? It's all off, then. Done! Operation is over, okay? Let them kick us out if they want! - I agree. I don't care. Out of my way. - Bye, asshole. Just crawl off somewhere and die already. Go ahead and die, just like you want to! Good job, Sinan. You said it a million times, and here we are. We're all screwed, just like you said we would be. He was actually afraid of being loved. Afraid of loving, connecting with someone.
