- I don't really know where to start. I think I've put a stop to it, I. I think I've laid it to rest. The horrors of World War One hide many mysteries. What really happened in the 1919 soldier riots? What happened to the missing Royal Fourth Norfolk Battalion? Did the London Scottish Regiment really perish at the Maecenas? Now I, Dr. Brian Locke, together with an award-winning documentary team, led by acclaimed filmmaker, Marcus Singh, will take on a journey through the battle fields of World War One in an attempt to find some answers. Our first stop are the fields of a battle that saw the greatest loss of life the world had ever seen. A battle that had no clear victor, and hides many shocking facts. The Battle of the Somme. Fire is easy if the ladies found out. Where are we going, girls? Where are we going? You figured it out yet? Like, Joanna, come on, you're from around here. You should know where we're going. - She's German, Marcus! - I've got it, I've got it. Look here. Okay, just here. If we go back in time and get a sat nav that actually speaks English, then we can arrive on location two hours from now! - I'm so glad we can rely on the men to be helpful. - Well, I can't hear you properly 'cause we're lost. - She's amazing. - Yeah, Emma's great. - I love her shows. You know the ghost show thing that she has? - Yeah the ghost show. That's funny. - I love it! It's crazy. - Yeah, I've gotta go, bye. - This map is huge. - How do you think they do it? Do you think it's like CGI or do you think it's like physical props? - Oh, I don't know. You'll have to ask Emma. I'm sure they've got some kind of artistic license. So this a beautiful river in France. We're panning 'round to our presenters. So while we wait, let's go and say hello to the talent, Incredibility and the Clapper. Boo! - Shit, Marcus. What are you guys talking about? - Um. - Uh, well, to be honest with you, Marcus, I've been having a few, um, problems with working out how myself and Emma would work together. And so, uh, well, she's been trying to reassure me. - How did you do it on the UFO show? The documentary. - Oh, no, that was real. That was Marcus's thing. All right, guys, on action, I just want a little piece to camera about why we're here, what the documentary's about. - Sure. - Okay? Got it? All right, Emma, we'll start on you. - Okay. - Okay. And action. - Hi, I'm Emma Washington, and I'm presenting this documentary on the Somme. At this point, I should probably hand over to our resident expert, uh, Dr. Brian. - Thanks, Emma. I'm Dr. Brian Locke, and I'm here to, we're here to explore the, uh, some of the mysteries and myths that surround the, uh, the Battle of the Somme. And also to, to, uh, to engage with, um, some of those hardships that the troops of the First World War, uh, would've gone through. Some of the horrors, particularly in the trench work. So, Emma, this is your first gig with the BAFTA-winning Torchlight Pictures, but is it your first historical documentary? - Um, no, I've done a few bits and pieces before. But I'm really looking forward to stepping it up. Yeah, me too. - I'm sorry, what? What the fuck? Okay now. - Sorry. - I'm just really excited to get started and, um, finally get to the location where all this history actually took place. - But, I, I, I do think that it is vitally important that we stick to the story of the Somme and that we treat the subject matter with a, uh, a degree of sensitivity. - Hmm. That's great, thanks, guys. That's certainly Somme-thing to think about. - Seriously? We're on, we're on, we're on, we're on, we're on. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to BAFTA-winning Torchlight Productions. And we have one member of the crew missing. Does someone wanna explain why we're missing Liam today? - I'd love to-- - 'Cause he's a wanker! What happened to him? - He's drunk! Is that normal for Liam? - Yes, it's very normal to be drunk for, actually, it is very normal for Liam to be drunk, but he's always turned up. I find that quite suspicious, actually, Marcus. - Oh, Daz, we don't need that camera on now. I'm tryin' to fix the camera. - What's happening? The call button keeps getting stuck. - Oh, please don't tell me it's broken. I haven't paid for that thing yet. Don't accusing me, Marcus, I was taking. Are you two arguing? - He's whinging again! - Oh, have you argued? I thought you kissed and made up. - We have kissed and made up. Aren't you gonna make it worse, Daz? - Hey, Joanna! Brian, sorry. Joanna, piss stop, please! - Can you be a bit more eloquent? - I'm not sure about it, not too. I mean, is Marcus always like this? Yeah, it seems like it. Oh, oh, I got one, I got one! Are you lonesome tonight? Twat! - Daz! Why are you filming everything? I'm not recording, Manda. I am merely checking the presets. - I just don't want you running the battery down. Once again, Manda, I am not recording. I am merely checking the presets. Joanna, what's going on? This is the second time we've stopped, you know? Marcus, I'm trying to find this on the map. Okay, well, how long will we be? - As long as it takes, Marcus. Well, if you need, Joanna, if you need help, you can ask one of us. - Marcus, I would gladly take your help if you're willing to give it. Joanna, I haven't got a problem with Joanna. It's just we're running into a tight schedule! - Okay, you know what, Marcus? None of this is my fault, okay? If you want to help me with the map, you can help me with the map. Directors are supposed to know their locations! Gareth Nunn would've have known the location. Fuck Gareth Nunn, that guy's a prick. He hasn't won a BAFTA. You're being rude! What, I'm not being rude. - You're so fond of mentioning your BAFTA. Amanda, come on now, I'm just saying-- - Why don't you ever mention The Hadrian's Wall? I don't like Gareth Nunn! There's no harm in not, not, not liking someone! We'll be there soon and it will be fun. Then everyone'll be happy and we'll have a drink tonight and it'll be fun. - I just don't like when you, when what you say is loaded and I don't know what, whether you're being honest or not. Amanda, please, can you just leave it now? You're embarrassing us. I just don't want the controversy. - Controversy? - What the? - What, sorry, what controversy? What are you talking about? - You know exactly what I'm talking about. Well, what controversy, say it, say it. Come on, Amanda, say it! - You say it. What controversy, say what? I've got nothing to say! You're the one that's piping up about controversy! Well, say something, then! - No. I'm sorry, Doctor. - Just don't be rude to people then! Well, you made me go there now! - No, you were rude to people. This is really embarrassing. - You were rude to people before this! You're embarrassing me in front of my guests! Previous owner has properly fucked this camera up. - All right, we should do a set-up. Joanna, stop the car, for real. - Over there's perfect. So, Emma, if you can ask Brian the question and if you'd both start walking towards the Somme, and, Brian, if you can play up that mystery thing that we spoke about. And, Emma, you can do this with your eyes closed, okay? Thank you. Well, I, I just follow 'em, do I? - Well, no, not unless you wanna film the back of their heads! You know that pillock is spelled with two Ls, Marcus. Okay, guys, happy, ready? Can we lose the jacket? Thank you. Daz, ready? - Sweet. - Thanks, Joanna. Joanna, hurry up, thank you. And action! - So, here we are, just meters away-- No, cut, cut, cut. Emma, we use yards in England. - Do we? - Do we? - Of course we do. - So, here we are, just meters away from where the bloody battle took place. And it's safe to say, the air still holds an air of, oh. Sorry, I just said air twice. Cut, cut, cut! - Dr. Brian Locke, would you say in your expert opinion that the battle was almost doomed from the start? - Well, that is a very good point you raise, Emma. Many war historians have said that the British plan was well, somewhat flawed. - Flawed? - Yeah, you see, the idea was that initially the British would use heavy artillery along a 15 mile front to, to decimate the German line, kill their soldiers, destroy their trenches, and then follow it up with advance and capture, cementing victory with the, the use of cavalry. What's that? - So, what was wrong with that plan? - Well, it was predicated on. The fuck have we got here? Oh, wait a fuck. They were there on the horizon. - Who was-- - They who, people? - People come about? - You promised there'd be no tricks this time. I am not joking, mate. You need to tell me now if I am wasting my time by bein' here. - You're not wasting your time, Daz, what's going on? Well then, what have I just seen? - I don't know! Where did you see some-- - There! Let's have a look at the playback, shall we, Marcus? - There's no need to look at the playback. We haven't got time for that. If you say there's something, then there's something. I trust you. Okay, guys, I apologize for this. Can we just go again, thank you very much. - So, here we are, just meters away from where the bloody battle took place. God's sake! Oh, dear. It might be a local, Daz, keep it rollin', catch it. Hello! Sir! Uh, English? Joanna, do you understand what he's saying? Hello? Hello, oui, bonjour. Do you speak English? No, no-- - Bonjour, monsieur. We make a TV show, and-- Amanda, you're still speaking English. He doesn't understand. Amanda, you're still speaking English. We're allowed to film here. - I think he's saying it's dangerous! - Okay, sir. Merci, thank you very much. He was saying it's dangerous? Why is it dangerous? - No idea. Daz, what's the mood like on camera? - A bit weird wasn't it, Mark? What do you mean? - Our boy in the Rover. Oh, he's just French. Nation of drunks. - Unidentified French object, huh? What are you insinuating? - Ain't insinuating anything, mate. At the end of the day, you're the bloke that CGI'd a fucking flying saucer over the top of Hadrian's Wall. And you haven't worked for 18 months because of it. Not this, not with this. It's a bit cold here, are you cold? - It's not the cold I'm feeling. It's something else. What about this production? - Can you tell us when you're gonna be doing that, please? Oh, no, guys, this is just behind the scenes stuff. I'm just trying to keep authenticity. So it's, uh, quite dull here. A bit somber. Aw, come on, guys. Where's your sense of humor? - Do you need some help, guys? Okay, so everyone's treating me like a prick. Well, I'm gonna go over here and do some B-roll. If anyone's interested. Nope. It's actually quite tranquil. Considering what happened here all those many, many years ago. What the fuck! What was that? I just saw something. I think I just saw something in that woods. Something moved in the woods. Something moved in the woods. Oh fuck. - So, how was working on those ghost shows? - Um, yeah, they were, they were good. - Yeah, a lot of fun? - I really loved them, they were really amazing. Fucking hell, Brian! Come with me. What's that bit over there? - What, that? Yeah, exactly. - That is Delville Wood. It's the scene of one of the Somme's most central battles. Hold on, hold on, what was that? Devil Wood? - No, Delville Wood. The irony. Uh, the irony is that it did actually get to become known as Devil Wood. Okay, wait, I've got an idea. - I really love the one that you did, um, The Deacon of Dark River, that you did in Iceland. That was really scary. That was fucked up. - I don't remember that one. - So, that there is Delville Wood-- No, no, cut, Brian, Brian, please. Just for the sake of this documentary, can we go with Devil, okay? - But, but. - Do you know if it was real? - Well, um, I guess a lot of 'em are based on, you know, real stuff but then, you know, it's a TV show. - So, that there is Devil Wood, the scene of one of the Somme's most central battles. Now, it's significant because after two weeks of the most hideous carnage, it became evident that a breakthrough for either side was unlikely. - Yeah, yeah, 'cause it went really crazy sometimes. - Yeah, it did do that! - Oh no, I wouldn't be able to tell the real ones from the fake ones, though. - Now whereas the Allies eventually won the Battle of the Woods, 80 % of that South African brigade were killed. It was terrible. Cut there! Hello, pretty foreign ladies! Whatcha doin'? What's the next set-up? - I have no idea. - Ask Amanda. - I think she's on the phone, but she can't get reception. And Marcus and Doctor Doolittle have disappeared and are doubtlessly plotting somewhere. - Now, when we do this on A-camera, if you could just ramp up the mystical element just a tad more. - Right, okay. - Yeah? With legends and curses-- Exactly! That's exactly what we need! Talk about curses, go, go with stuff like that. - All right. - Daz, is, is that camera recording? I can hear it hissing. It sounds like it's - Don't think so. - Take the camera, okay? And, uh, go and film some stuff over there. Get as much historical stuff as you can. Go and have fun with it, okay, I'm going for a quick piss. Well, well how do I turn it on? Well it already is on. If you press that button there, that turns it off. - So, are you on? Right. This would have been a trench somewhat clumsily preserved with corrugated steel. Do we just? Do you wanna set up anyway? - Yeah, sure, why not? Let's do it. So, the soldiers would have lived in. What is that? What is that? Ow! Ow! Oh wow. No! No! No, seriously? Okay. Hello, everybody! And welcome to a trench. Now, I probably shouldn't be touching this, but this is the cap of a German mustard gas canister, which means that this is a German trench. Now, it would have led into a complex underground tunnel system. So if we, if we move to the end of the trench we should see. Yes, yes, look, there it is! It's, uh, this is the entrance to the underground tunnel system, which would have been used by miners to, to excavate under enemy lines to plant explosives. This is amazing! Right. Let's get Marcus. Gas. Gas! Oh my God, I've opened this! - What are you doing in the trench, Doc? We've got to get out of here! - It's just a bit of fog. Give me that. - So here in these very fields in 1916, took place one of the bloodiest battles in mankind's history. This melancholic and, some say, haunted place still holds many secrets. Secrets we hope to unravel during the course of this program. And cut there. It's brilliant, Emma, well done. - Uh, yeah, that's my line! Thank you, Emma, that's beautiful. It's really, really, really good, I love it. Daz, that's great camera work. My only thing is, I think it's just a little bit safe. - Safe. - Yeah, well, I mean, essentially it's just Emma standing in a field. It needs, it needs a hook. A bit more excitement. Okay, just give me a minute, let me think about this. - The battle took place in a field. In this field. That's what we're doing. - Yeah, but it's boring Amanda, it's boring, we need something else. - Depends what you mean by manipulating. You know, you can kind of. Kind of spin a reality. It's like history. We do a lot of history stuff, right? So you gotta, you've gotta have the hook. It's like revisionism in literature. You become, you know this. You become well-known for saying something new about something. - Well, yeah, sure. But, I mean, there's only a certain amount of information. - What, is there anything interesting about this, Marcus? It's behind-the-scenes footage. These woods were so heavily bombarded by the Germans. There's a massive grave, I think it's probably filled with water. There's a tree, Marcus. I only really came back and worked with him because I felt sorry for him. It was a bad eight months after Hadrian's Wall all fucked up. What exactly did he do on the Hadrian' Wall film? If you can believe it, he CGI'd a flying saucer over the top of it. Well, I hope he's got nothing planned like that on this one. Daz, what's this thing here? Guys, what's this mad-looking thing here? We do a set up? Yeah, let's do a set up here. - Brian, I want you to know-- - Are you happy with that view? - Yeah, uh, sorry, guys? Excuse me! Mand! Can you just take? Can you look at me for a second? Move back a step. Just take four. - Thank you! Although it's fading. - Do you think they have to turn a bit then? - Please, I won't ask you to lie. But just go with the embellishment for now, I can always reign in. - All right, okay. I can always cut it. - No, no, no. - If we get a shot now, it'll be fine. - Unproved rumor and sped through an Allied battalion about a regiment of Germans based here in Delville Wood-- Devil Wood. - That were cursed by a tortured British soldier. - Really? - Really? - And here's the thing. Apparently, they all became the undead. Brian, that was fantastic. - What? Can you just say that again, that last sentence again, but more towards camera? - You tell it very well. - Brian, professor! Doctor, could you just say that last sentence again but more towards this camera? And action. - - Uh, they, uh, they, they all became the undead. So they were probably called zombies. Jesus Christ! It's like I've got a talking hemorrhoid. No, but seriously, Brian, can you say that on the day, undead? - The fighting here at Devil Wood eventually secured the British right flank. And marked the Western Front debut of the South African First Infantry Brigade. After holding this wood for five days, the brigade ended up losing over 2,500 men. Okay, Emma, we're gonna do that again. But this time I want you to kneel down, mention how fierce the fighting was, point to the tree stump, and say it was hit by a cannon. Okay? Marcus, that is not cannon damage. - Here we have a tree destroyed by cannon damage. It's a sobering thought, but imagine a cannon causing this effect hitting a human being. The results would be terrifying. Oh! Oh, watch the camera, Daz! You've fucking broken it. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You didn't hurt yourself when you fell or anything? No, I'm fine. It's okay. - Okay, you know what, I think Amanda has some whisky-- - Here Emma, let's change your boots for you there. - From Liam, would you like some? - Okay, sure. - I'll get you some. I'm gonna give you my jacket to take on the train. Marcus! What? Where did you put the whiskey from Liam? Don't know! Emma, how are you feeling right now? - What are you doing? Put that camera away. She is soaking wet. That's completely unprofessional. Who's side you on? - Will you? Doctor, what have we got over here? I'm not entirely sure. I've never seen anything like this before. You what? - I said I've never seen anything like this before. So could we be facing an exclusive here? - I don't know, what do you mean? Well, it's something that's never been caught on camera before. - Oh, Marcus, I don't really think this is-- Well, I need you to say this right to camera. Okay, and action. - I've never seen anything like this before. And what is it you found? I don't know. There's something submerged. I can't quite get to-- - Marcus. Daz. How we doing on the camera? Workin' on it, mate, workin' on it. Be careful with that thing. It's working now. I'll be amazed if it lasts a day. Got something! What is it? It's a bit of metallic, I think it's a chain. What have you got there, Doc? I think it's a chain. Can we get it out? This is looking great, guys. Emma, can you give him a hand? Fantastic. Looking really, really good. Oh! Oh, careful. Okay. - Okay, let's give this a heave. Okay, so after three. - Okay. - One, two, three. What the fuck was that? What the, it's a fucking body! I'm sure it was moving. So who do you think he was, Brian? - Well, from what I can glean from the remainder of his uniform, he was Rhodesian, which would correctly place him here in Delville Wood as part of the 3rd Battalion of the South African Brigade. This is something of real historical significance. So, Amanda, are we friends again? - Yes, we are. I can't thank you enough. It was a fantastic idea to do this documentary. - It's a pretty unbelievable find. - Well, this is a. Bodies do pop up from time to time. This is something completely different. Yeah, it'll put us right back on the map. - Tortured, shackled, forced into that box full of dark, stagnant water and left to die of starvation, disease, dysentery. - Brian seems really happy again so that is a really good thing. Dr. Locke, are you happy? - Happier. What the fuck is that? Oh, it looks like we found something again. Let's go back over to the body. God. Don't do that. Silence, please, guys. Oh God, that's disgusting. Shh, shh, shh, Joanna, shh! What is it, Doc? - No. Well, it appears our unknown friend here was a fan of the occult. This amulet would've been used in the popular African practice of black magic to raise the dead. - Wow. - Perhaps he was even tryin' to cheat his own death. It also appears that he swallowed it. Possibly to avoid it being, uh, discovered. - Incredible. - Cut there, right, guys, that's fantastic! I think we're gonna call that a wrap for today, well done! I know tempers have been a little bit frayed today, to say the least, but we're gonna deal with this tomorrow. We'll call the authorities, but for now I think we're all gonna go back to the van and have a beer. Thank you very much, guys, no one tell Liam. Cheers, give yourselves a round of applause. Thank you, well done. Right, can we get all this stuff cleared up and get back as soon as possible? Yeah, good idea, it's getting late. You okay, Emma? Other than being a little creeped out. You're not the only one. Heading back to the van after a very, very successful day. Right on, guys, great job. Brian, fantastic work. - Cut that off, Marcus, will you? When you get drunk with that fella. - Oh my God. What's up, Amanda? What is that? She must've seen something. Amanda, wait. This is just getting better and better. Oh Jesus Christ, what is that? Who's done that? Guys, guys! We've got something. Brian, Brian, come over here. What have you found? My God. Maybe we should just get outta here. - That is so weird. It's a World War I victory trophy This is getting too weird. Wow. That shouldn't be here. What's it still doing here? Come on, guys, let's keep the spirits up. Well, you all look a bit freaked out by that but personally I just think it was, you know, kids messing around in the forest. That's what kids do, right? - It's weird. Brian, um, can you, can you tell us more about, you know, you mentioned trophy, and some of our viewers may know something about a football match that took, took place in no man's land. - Well, that would've been Christmas Day, 1914. Right. - And someone kicked a football into the middle of no man's land and started an impromptu game of football between the Germans and the Allies. And I bet the Allies won that, too. - Germany did, three, two. What? I found it! Right, this is gonna take five minutes. Brian, you keep filmin' this! Oh, for goodness' sake. The penalty spot here. Five penalties each, England versus Germany. I can't believe he's doin' this, it's ridiculous. If I do this? - Let's go. - It's gonna take five minutes and then we'll go to the pub. Don't even do this. Come on! - Darren, my key. - So this is the goal, Joanna, you're to get the orange ball in between this. - It's typical. I tell ya what, I tell ya what. Winner gets to wear this in the pub later. - Marcus, Marcus! - The loser buys the drinks. - That's an historical artifact! - I'll buy the drinks anyway 'cause I'm havin' a go. Here, Brian, hold that. Do it! Come on, Joanna. We'll do one, okay, we'll do one, and then we go! - Come on! Just kick it. - Yeah? Kick it! Boom, safe! Okay, you saved it, you won, Marcus. Yeah, let's go. Guys, cheer up, we'll be in a pub in a minute. - It's freezing. - Yeah, okay, equal, equal, that's good, that's good, okay? No, you met your match. - No, no, no, no, that's equal. He just doesn't get it. Let's do this, five each, guys, chill. You just don't get that we want to go home. We're doin' five each, mate. We're gonna be here forever. Is there someone over there, who's that? - Uh. - Hello? - Is that? - This is Marcus. Oh, well done, Marcus. This, this is special. I can't believe you, Marcus, I really can't. Amanda. Guys, come on, let's move back towards the van. Everybody move back! Back away, guys. Amanda! We've gotta be careful. Marcus, leave it now, come on, please, please! Let's go back. What do you think you're doing? Amanda! Fuck, run, run! Marcus, Joanna, Joanna, listen where they're coming from! What is going on? Jesus. No! Get the fuck off of her! I can't see! Marcus! Everybody, get, get out, run back! They're coming from fucking everywhere! Who are they? Get back! Where do we go? They're comin'! Look out! Marcus, what's goin' on? Marcus! What's happening, what's happening? Joanna, Joanna, this way, come this way, quickly! Oh my God, run, run! Oh my God, get to the trench! The trench, Marcus, the trench! This way, I know where to go! Follow me! - Where are you? - Follow my voice! - Where are you? I can't see you, Brian! Marcus, I'm here. - It's too dark! - I'm here, down here. Brian, where are you? Follow my voice, follow my voice, this way. Try to find my hand! My hand, Brian! - Shh, shh, shh, shh. I'm here, I'm here, down here. Brian, Brian. Oh good God, Joanna! Oh my God. Who would do this, was this you? - Brian, Brian. - Take my hand. - Gimme your camera. Give me the camera. - Oh my God. Oh my God, Joanna! - Quiet! Brian, Brian, come close, come here! Come here! - What are they? Brian, calm down, calm down! Calm down. Go, go. - Daz, you okay? Emma, move, just keep moving, go! Keep moving. - What happened to Amanda? - I don't know! I don't fuckin' know, I don't wanna know. I can see something in front of you. Just keep walking. - I can't see. - You're okay. I think it's a tunnel, I think it's a tunnel. Just keep walking, keep walking. Slowly, slowly, Brian, keep it together. Keep it together, Brian. They killed Joanna. - I can see. - Oh my God. Over there, in here, in here. In here, in here. They're behind you, they're behind you, move! Oh God, he's coming! Come on, get in here! They're screaming! No, gimme your hand! - Daz? - Gimme your hand! Just go, go! - What are they, oh my God? Brian, Brian, we keep hearing voices. - The soldiers! I don't know what they are but, Brian, Brian, Brian, calm down. Here open it, gimme your hand. Okay, Brian, we need you to talk about this. - What, are you crazy? I've killed a member of my fucking team, Brian. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Okay, Brian. - I can't think like this! We need it for fuckin' evidence, Brian. Now listen, I need you to take this camera. Brian, I need you. - My wife, my wife! Keep it together, Brian! Move, move, move, move, move, come on, Emma, move! Daz? There, go, the tunnel there, go, go, go, go! You okay? Get in it, get in the tunnel! Come on! Daz, what's going on? Move, Emma. Come on! - Now point the camera towards me, towards me. Okay? - I can see, Marcus. - You got me, okay, okay. I'm gonna get something we've just found. Where is it, where is it, it's here, it's here, I've got it. That, that's it. Okay, okay, okay. Hey, Brian, keep the camera on me, keep it on me. Brian! My name is Marcus Singh. I'm a documentary film, Brian, keep the camera on me! I'm a documentary filmmaker and I'm here with my historical advisor Dr. Brian Locke, Dr. Brian Locke, Brian, I need you to come into shot. Put the camera down, put the camera down! Brian, Brian, listen to me and put the camera down! You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. - What's happening, why isn't that going off? Come here, take this. Use that, the batteries are down, use that. That's it, now go, keep moving! Fuck's sake, Emma, keep moving! Come on! - You okay? - Come into shot, come into shot. This is Dr. Brian Locke. And we are here in the Somme in France and we have been attacked by something. Brian, can you explain what we've been attacked by? I don't. - They were in soldiers' uniforms and they have murdered one of my team and I repeat, they have murdered one of my team. Brian, I need you here! Ah, fuck. - What was that? - What, what? - I can see something. No, it's me. Get outta here, Emma, go, move! - Now we have got ourselves into a tunnel and we don't know what these tunnels were used for. Brian, can you explain what these tunnels were used for? They were. - I'm gonna keep the camera rolling as evidence. Right, Brian turn the lantern. Turn off the lantern. We're gonna have to go further in, further in. Okay, come on. - Daz, are you okay? - Yeah. It's so fuckin' dark. Are you okay? The fuckin' hell are we? Jesus! Daz. What was that? Coming from, I don't know where it's coming from. Move, Brian! Is there an entrance there, is there an entrance there? - Daz, why are the lights coming on? The gas! - I don't know, fuckin' move! It's got my leg! Oh shit, Daz, help me! Brian! Brian, Brian, are you okay, are you okay? Brian, get up! Die, die, die, fucker! Brian, Brian, you're okay. Brian, Brian, don't die on me, are you okay? Brian, talk to me, don't die! Oh thank God. Oh, shit, the camera, the camera, the camera's going. The camera, Brian. Okay, I've taken the memory card but I think the camera is fucked. Oh no. - What's that, Brian? It's my personal stills camera. - Does it record? - Yes. - Okay, give it to me. Give it to me. I'm not sure how useful it's gonna be. Brian, you need to keep it together for me. Brian, Brian, you need to keep it together for me. - Where are all the others? - Brian, Brian. - No! Brian, look at me, look at me! Look at me, Brian. I see a door, I think it's a way out. Get back in there, don't go near it! You need to keep it together. Brian, okay, now listen, you're the expert, you're the expert. Tunnels, how would we get out of tunnels? Brian, how would we get out of tunnels? - I guess there would've been a, a small room, towards the start of the tunnel. A dept, they would have briefings and. We're gonna have to kill it. What do ya mean kill it? How are we gonna kill it? Where would we go? - Just through there, this way. Okay, I'm following you, Brian. I'm following you. Oh God. All right, gimme that! Try to hit him! Do it! - I'm fuckin' doin' it, Emma. - Just do it! - Why is this lit? This shouldn't be lit. I'm gonna do it, stand back! We're stuck here, what was that? Can't get anywhere. - Don't get too close. It's blocking the door. It's blocking the door! We have to clear this, we have to clear this. Here, take that, take that. Oh fuck! Oh my God, that's disgusting! Brian, you need to put the camera down and help me! Oh fuck! Help me, help me. Help me, Brian! Marcus is that you? Marcus! Marcus, Brian, stay where you are, don't come on this side! Stay where you are! Emma, Emma, Emma, you need to help us! There's a door here! You need to help move these rocks! - Marcus, Marcus, they're coming! Daz, let's use something. Emma! Here, use this. We've gotta kill him. Come on, come on, do it, Daz. I'll give this a fuckin' go. - Oh my God. - Emma! - Marcus, hurry! - I know, Marcus! We're coming. Emma! - Emma! - Hurry! They're getting closer! - Move the rocks! They're getting closer! I'm moving the rocks! We need to clear this way! I can't get through! Clear the rocks! I've done it, I think I've done it. Get off of me. What do I do, what do I do? What do I do? Oh, Daz, Daz. - Marcus, quickly, come through, come through! Quickly, Marcus, come on, come on! Quickly, quickly, we gotta get through this door. Quickly! - Go, go, go, go, go, go! Run, close the door! Close it, lock it, close it! Oh God. Shh, it left. What is this place? It's a supply depot, there might be supplies here or something. Something, something, something to show us a way out. - Fuck. I fuckin' stuck myself. There's nothing here. This place was raided long ago. - Is that camera still on? Did you catch anything? Did you catch anything before? - I don't fuckin' believe you, mate. No, I'm talkin' about for evidence, Daz. And the people need to know what has happened to us. - What are you talkin' about? - I'm talkin' about for evidence. For no other reason but evidence. - What does it matter if we're all fucking dead? How the fuck are we gonna get outta here? I don't know. - You have the bright ideas, you're usually the one with the bright ideas, Marcus, huh? I don't have any bright ideas. Do you have any bright ideas? - No, I don't. Well let's work together then. - I'm open to suggestions, come on. Let's work together. - I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't know exactly how we were gonna get outta of here. I don't believe you. I am fed up with you accusing me. You think I would kill my own people? I would kill my own people? - Guys, calm down! Are you fucking nuts? Guys! I would kill my own people? I think it's time we left the cameras behind. I would never go that far! What are you talking about? You're a fuck like always. Yeah? What are you doin', man? I'm doin' your job. Leave it alone, I said fuckin' leave it alone! - Happy now? No, not really, mate. But if anybody's gonna shoot this, it's gonna be me. 'Cause if it's gonna be my last, it's gonna be me best. Guys, stop it. How do we get outta here? - There's only one way outta here. And that's through them. - How are we gonna do that? They come from everywhere. We might not even be safe in here. Maybe it was something that we did. - I think we've disrespected something. - Does anyone remember what that French guy was saying? - No, but I think it's got something to do with that tortured skeleton. You guys are talking rubbish. - Oh are we, are we, considering what we've just seen? - Psychos, okay, these are real people. - Get that camera outta my face, Marcus! - Shit. Look, it doesn't matter, it's not important now. This place is about to fall apart. - We need to destroy this. What are you talking about? - I can't believe I'm saying this. Look, history is littered with stories of curses. Tutankhamen, Otzi the Iceman, and the curse of Tiamat. There's loads of them. Maybe this is one, too. This is priceless, Brian. Maybe it was the gas canister that you found in the trench, huh? - What gas canister? Exactly! - It was a German gas canister. It was old, look, it's ridiculous! It's got nothing to do with it! - Brian, it's ridiculous because curses aren't real Psychos are. Give me that. What happened to your hand? - Nothing. Were you bitten? - What? No. Because if the stories are true. Aw, so what, he's gonna turn into one? Don't be ridiculous, Brian! - I'm fine, everything's fine. Let's have a look, let's have a look. He's just cut himself. - What'd I tell you about that camera, Marcus? You know, that thing is probably worth a fortune. - I don't give a damn. - Throw that in. - Maybe this isn't working. - Yes, yes! - It worked! That seemed to work. I'm really not buyin' this, guys. Really, really not buyin' this. I don't know, I thought I heard something. Could just be dust falling. Emma, I know it's not the right time for this but are you buyin' into this bullshit as well? - Marcus, please don't, we've gotta try something. Did you hear that? - There's nothing there, man. I swear to God, it's just the wind. Yeah, of course, all the psychos have gone away 'cause we broke a piece of jewelry. - I think I can still hear moaning, but I'm not sure. - Fuck this. I've got an idea. Agreed? Not really. I think we should all go together but, hey, I'm outvoted. - All right then, on three. One, two, three. Fuck it. Okay. Okay. Shh. All right. On one. Two. Three. It's clear. What are ya starin' at, you morons? Come on, let's get out of here. Grab anything you can find. Anything useful. - We need weapons! Anything we can use! Just get some, just stock up. Rocks, anything. They're in here! Guys, there's more of them! Get out of here, get out! Shut the fucking door! Because they're coming through! He's gone, he's gone. Gotta take this! Come on! Come on! Go, go! Move, Marcus, get up and move! I can't see. - They killed Brian, they killed Brian. Yeah, I know, they killed fuckin' Brian but we've got to get out of here, Marcus. Pull your fuckin' act together. If it wasn't the amulet, what was it? Think, think, think. We're never gonna make it across the field. - Yes we are. We need to move them away from us. We need a diversion of some kind. Maybe we can use the dynamite. - Dynamite, okay, good, what and. This is crude. It'll double the range. Should be able to check out the range from the trench to the van with this. Look, you take this, I'll go. - Fuck that, fuck that. You stay here and look after Emma! - I'm the cameraman, I will do it. No, Daz, no! - Makes sense, Emma, I know how it works. - I'll do it. - Shut up. And stick to the plan. Okay? I'll peer over the edge of the trench with this. See if the van is clear. If it is, we can run for it. If it's not, we'll use the dynamite as a distraction. Okay? Be careful. Please be careful. - Take this. Okay. If I'm not back in, uh, less than 10 minutes. Assume the worse. Be careful, Daz. Anything? - No. Emma, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything. - Marcus, please don't. It's all my fault. Round of applause please for Dr. Brian Locke, everybody! No, we are so privileged to have this man here on this documentary, fantastic, fantastic man. - Please, just, just Brian, though, just Brian. Brian, okay, Doctor, Doctor Zhivago. Joanna, Joanna, she's sweet, oh God. Resident ball-breaker for Torchlight Pictures. - Slash babysitter. Slash babysitter, this is Amanda. This is the girl that keeps me in check. What if we lose Daz? Oh God. - Marcus, we won't. What if we lose Daz? - Don't say that. Fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! - Marcus, what? Darren, my keys. - Fuck! Fuck! - What, Marcus, what? Joanna gave Daz the keys to the van. Oh shit, are you sure? Are you sure? - Yes! - Oh shit. - Oh God. If he doesn't come back we are fucked. Hey, can you check to see if there's a light from the flare? They may be out. No? Oh God. - No. Okay, Emma, this wasn't all me, you know? - Marcus, please don't. No, just. - It's okay, it's Daz, he's here! - No way. - Daz! Oh God yes. Marcus, he's here! Yes, God. Emma move, move. - Oh my God! - Run! - Marcus, Marcus! Quick, quick, quick, quick. Shh, shh. I can't see, I can't see. Emma, Emma, where are you going? Is that Daz? Up to the hill? - They got Daz. - I know. They got Daz, they got Daz, they got Daz. Fuck, they got Daz. Oh God. - No, wait, maybe that's how we do it. Brian said, he just didn't realize. Remember when we found that body? He said that the remains were undiscovered, that he wasn't laid to rest. Maybe we should bury him. - Are you serious? I just don't remember the land being laid out. - So how accurate do we think this is? - As accurate as I can remember. - Okay. - 'Kay, so if this is where you and Daz came in then this has to be where me and Brian came in. Which would make the football pitch here. And Delville Wood there. - Shit, we have to go. Keep going, keep going. That's it, go, go. Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. We head for the depot, we run through fut-were-it, then I'll light these. That should lure enough of them out and then I'll throw the dynamite and that should give us enough time to get to the woods and bury the skeleton, okay? - Okay. - You know this is totally fuckin' crazy, don't you? Emma, Emma, Emma. Here, take the camera. Take it, Emma. - Okay. Marcus, be careful, are you okay? Oh shit, Marcus. My leg, my leg, it's got my leg, it's got my leg! Marcus! This way, let's run. Run, run, Emma, move, quickly, quickly, quickly! Watch out! - Marcus! - Watch out! Emma, go, run! Run, run! Emma, Emma. Emma! Emma, where are you? Emma! Where are you, where are you, where are you? Where are you, Emma, Emma, Emma. Emma! Emma! Emma! Emma! Emma! Hello! Emma! Emma! I don't wanna die, oh God, I don't wanna. I don't wanna die. Oh fuck, oh fuck. It's in the trench. I found this. Die! Oh fuck! Come on, motherfucker! Come on, motherfucker! Fuck you, fuck you! Fuckin' stay down. And you fuckin' prick! Ah, fuck this. - Maybe he made it. If anyone can. Daz can. All right, we are going to get these bastards. Once and for all. Okay, now, you see beyond there, beyond the pitch? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. That's Delville Wood. Okay, right. Now, I want you to take this camera. Okay. Okay, okay. - And then after three, we are gonna run for it, okay? Okay. - We can do this, Emma. Okay. - Out the window. Two, three, go. Run, run, run! Emma, run! What's going on? Emma, run, head for the van, head for the van! Get down, Emma, get down, get down, get down, Emma! Fuck! We're gonna die, we're in a minefield! We're in a minefield! We're in a minefield, shit! Okay, it's gone quiet, it's no more, it's all right. Okay, okay, okay, fuck, okay. I'm gonna take this. I'm gonna take this flare, I'm gonna, I'm gonna light it. I'm gonna lure the rest of these fuckers out. We're gonna flood 'em out. Okay, we're gonna get to the woods. Can you see the wood, Emma? - Yeah. - Emma? - Yeah. - Emma. Can you see the wood? - I see it. Oh fuck, oh fuck, okay, okay. Okay, you ready? Okay, I hope this works. I hope this fucking works. God, I hope it works. There's one, there's one. There's another, there's another. Oh God, I can see them all. Marcus, there's more. There's more. Oh God, there's four of them. God, it's like 50 more workers. We're gonna have, we're gonna have to use the dynamite. Yeah. We're gonna have use the dynamite. Gonna have to. Okay, okay, fuckers. Let's let them all bunch up. Let these fuckers bunch up. Then we'll blow them up. We're gonna blow them up and we're gonna head for the woods, okay? - The vest is too heavy. We can't throw it from here. One of us is gonna have to walk it in, it's too dangerous. What are you doing? Why are you showing me this? It's the memory card for the camera that broke. Oh, Marcus, no. Jesus. Doesn't mean that you have to. - It does. I need you to do one thing for me, Emma. I need. I need you to bury the skeleton, find Daz, and get out of here. Come on, you can do it. I'm so sorry, Marcus. - I'm sorry, too, Emma. I'm sorry. To whoever sees this. What's happened here today has been the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life. And I just want to say I'm sorry for everything I did. And everything I've done. Yeah, yeah! Liam, just like this, yeah? That way I can do the filming, you can do the set-up. Everyone knows you like a drink. You'll make loads of cash and have all the birds gaggin' for me again. You fuckin' twat. I bet you missed all the good bits, nardo. Where is that French bloke, I want to see him. Marcus, I've got the fake body on the quad bike! Marcus, oh, my God, I look like the living death. Fuck. Guys, Marcus! Emma! Guys? Guys! Guys, come on, it's not funny anymore! Brian, Emma. - Um. I don't really know where to start. All my colleagues are dead. I guess that isn't anything new for this place. I think I've, I think I've put a stop to it, I, I think I've laid it to rest. This is really, really not funny anymore. Guys! Guys! - Liam? Emma, Emma, is that you? Liam! Liam! Where are you guys? I'm here now. Come on, guys, come on, will you just? Stop it, please. What the fuck is that? What have you been doing, guys? Hang on a minute, that's, this is not, this is not a game, guys. Come on, I'm not, guys, I'm not playing this stupid game. Let's all fuckin' mess about with Liam. Let's have him stay up all fuckin' night. So we can all just take the piss out of Liam just because he's Liam? I might not be the cleverest person in the world but I'm not stupid! What the fuck is this? What? Daz?
