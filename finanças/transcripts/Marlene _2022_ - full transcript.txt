[music swells] [Marlene's voice] He took 12-year-old Lynne Harper to the bushes, dropped his bike, and dragged her over the barbed wire fence. He knocked her out, took off her panties, leaving them there in his haste, and dragged her across the bush to a clearing where he strangled her with her own shirt... and raped her. [siren] Steven Murray Truscott, you shall be taken to the place of execution and hanged by the neck until you are dead. Have you anything to say for yourself? "No, your honor." [woman] No. No, my son is innocent. [indistinct prisoner voices echoing] [man's voice] What's it like? You're married to a convicted rapist and murderer. [Marlene's voice] You mean a wrongfully convicted boy of 14 who went out for a bike ride. [man] Can you tell the audience why you are in darkness? [Marlene] I'm protecting my family. Our children deserve to grow up without the shadow of their father's conviction. [man] Can you tell us what it's been like... Hiding? You can't use your real name, Truscott. [Marlene] It's hard to remain silent. I've felt alone. Alone for a very long time. [man] But you agreed to do this one interview. [Marlene] I wanted to set the record straight. My husband is innocent. [dramatic music] [man on radio] ...summer, thanks to a favorable ruling by the IRS. The split was contingent on farmers certain tax ruling without any tax liability to either company or their shareholders. - [fanfare on radio] - [woman] This is a special report. [woman 2] Good evening. For almost 30 years, David Milgaard was called a killer. In an instant today, science cleared his name. Milgaard swore he didn't murder Gail Miller, but still he spent 23 years in prison. Supporters swore he was innocent too, but they couldn't prove it. Now, DNA has. And Milgaard's lawyers say DNA has pointed the finger right at someone else. [woman 3] David will be so happy about this announcement. The DNA testing absolutely exonerated my son. [woman 2] It was with great emotion that David Milgaard's mother, Joyce, announced her son's name has finally been cleared once and for all. [plane engine whirring] [Marlene's voice] Steve always loved flying. He said it was the place that he felt free, up there in the sky. [deep breath] No bars. How was it up there? [Marlene chuckles] - Looked beautiful. - Yeah. What are you smiling at? I've been thinking... maybe we should do the DNA like David Milgaard. Marlene, it's been so many years. He was in jail for 23 years. It-- There are so many similarities and it was a long time for him too. And his witnesses recanted. But if there is DNA, then-- then-- then it all goes away. The kids are grown up now. Leslie's getting married. She's gonna - have a family of her own. - Devon's only 17. He's almost 18! He's almost 18. And I can't let you go to your grave a convicted murderer. I won't. Do it for the kids. I don't want to do anything that will hurt them. But they will support you. You know they will. God, for once, just do something for yourself. You're never gonna know unless you try. What are you waiting for? Can't wait for someone to walk into the police and say they did it, 'cause it's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. - You don't have-- - I'm scared, Marlene. I know. I know. Let's go. Yes, Julian Sher, please. It's Marlene Bowers. Well, he-- He has been hounding me to do this story. My husband's name is Steven Truscott. Tell him we're ready. I do the research for the show. Julian is the producer. You and I will be working closely. Well, you'll have to get used to me. I've a bit of a photographic memory. - Obsessed with details. - Good. Then we'll get started. I've ordered all the police records and files from the base, any men that had criminal records at the time of Lynne's death. Finally. They're looking at somebody else. Marlene, I need to say this: We're journalists. Our job is to find the truth. - We're not here to prove Steve innocent. - My husband is innocent. I want you to know that we'll follow every thread of evidence, turn over every rock, but I can't promise you you'll like what we turn up. I'm not afraid of the truth. Steve, if you want to prove your innocence, you need a lawyer. It's difficult in cases like these. Only four have ever gone to trial. [Marlene] You succeeded with David Milgaard, Guy Paul Morin. Well, you seem to be somewhat of a legend, James. There was DNA. I was lucky. If you give me permission to reopen this case, - there's no turning back. - We won't be turning back. If there is DNA, I can guarantee a result. That is the magic bullet. [sigh] So another lawyer with guarantees. I want to be perfectly clear. The killer would have left behind DNA. There's no way they didn't. And if it's you... it would be suicidal to go ahead with this because I'll prove it in no time. It's the simplest thing in the world. Well, then... we've got nothing to worry about. I have nothing to hide. Let's go for it. [gentle music] Why? Why? Times have changed. - We've been through this before. - They have DNA now, Dot. - No. - They didn't have that back then. The courts are never going to give in. You know that, Steven. They didn't before. - We want a new trial. - A new trial? Every time I had hope, they knocked us down. - Why bring everything up? - Because it'll be different this time. - Steven is free now. - No! No. He is not free. And he never will be free until his name is cleared. [woman's voice] We want to order all of the files under the Access of Information Act. Thousands of them from the police, witness statements, the doctors, experts... We'll need Steven to sign for them. And I want a copy of every single piece of paper that you order. Those are Steve's papers. He has a right to them. Oh, I can't wait to get my meat hooks into these. Just over there. [dramatic music] Thank you. [relieved chuckle] [giggling] [Marlene's voice] It's-- It's overwhelming, Theresa. There's-- There's over 20,000 pieces of paper. [Theresa] You were a statistician. You know how to do this. Cross-reference everything. Start at the beginning. Okay. Thanks. [calm music] [Marlene's voice] Hm. When did it all begin? Steven was a half hour away, and I didn't know it. [young Marlene] I think he's dreamy. [indistinct] - You have a crush on him. - Do not! He's a dork. People didn't talk about rape and murder back then. - [girl] You're lying. - [indistinct] I did feel a little guilty about that. While I was having the best time of my life, Steve was... Steve was in a cell, waiting to be hanged. [woman] You should read this, Marlene. It's an excerpt from a book by this journalist, Isabel LeBourdais. This boy has been in jail for seven years now. Maybe later, Mom. I have a date. She said she started looking into the case because she was against capital punishment. - Then she realized he's not guilty. - He's late. He was just 14 when he was arrested. Your age. Steven Truscott. [vehicle approaches] [vehicle passes] [slow music] [Marlene's voice] I couldn't put it down. Steve's story was like a door opened, and-- and this crack of light came in. [vehicle approaches] [horn honking] [birds chirping] [man] Did you read this? Yes, what do you think will happen? Nothing. - Well he's innocent. - It's just not the right time. Country's not ready for it. Well, Isabel's book is sold out. Can't wait to read it. - [thunder cracks] - [young Marlene's voice] Steven was a 14-year-old boy, like yours or mine. Some man with a very sick mind raped and strangled the young girl that night. No one ever asked whether Steven had the sickness of the strangler and the rapist. Every witness, every clue, every fact that did not support a case against him was overlooked or ignored. Why? [♪] So there's... Clinton. There's school. The bridge. And up to the highway. Dawson's bush. Over there. That's where Lynne asked Steven to give her a ride on his bike. She told him she wanted to hitchhike to see the men with the ponies. She was mad at her mom that night. She didn't want to go home. [older Marlene's voice] It was all there, just like Isabel's book. Just like I'd imagined. Come on. - [mom] Is it far? - It's just up in these trees, I think. [ominous music] She was naked except for her undershirt. Her socks beside her. Turquoise shorts... neatly folded. Steve rode over the bridge with Lynne towards the highway, and she got into a car with fins and a yellow mark. [Lynne giggling] Two child witnesses saw Steve and Lynne ride over the bridge. And then... another child saw Steve ride back alone. The police didn't believe any of them. They said they were liars. Police said you couldn't see anything from here, but you can see everything. Isabel was right. They lied. Steven went back to the school yard and talked to a group of boys, and he had no blood on him. No scratches. And he was home babysitting by 8:05 p.m. Why would a boy who had just raped somebody seem perfectly normal? What's wrong? I don't know... what's wrong with me. I-- I've... It just feels so real. [older Marlene's voice] I felt like I had been there before. Like everything that happened in my life had led me to that moment. [cell door slams closed] [slow music] [keys jangling] [weatherman on radio] ...tomorrow, more sunshine and slightly warmer temperatures, with the winds from the south at 17 miles per hour. It's currently 47 degrees. [announcer] And now a CKCX special report. [man] A decision for Steven Truscott came down today. [static begins] His appeal has been denied by the Supreme Court. [signal improves] ...eight to one against. [more static] ...only one dissenting voice, Justice Hall. The judges decided he had a fair trial. [♪] [phone ringing] - [woman] Hello? - Isabel? Yes? [Marlene's voice] I'd like to help. I have an idea. [calm music] [Isabel] They said I was attacking the justice system, the police, the medical profession... - Everything they hold sacred. - I was a woman attacking everything they held sacred. I was also the first woman to ever use the word "penis" - on national television. - [giggles] I have 2,000 signatures. I sent them to Stanley Knowles, MP. He's only one voice, but he is on our side. He'll fight for him. Do you think... Do you think they'll let him go before his parole? No. No, I don't. They don't want to release him. - I'm sure of it. - They're afraid of the truth. We have to keep fighting. [dog barks, birds chirp] [water splashing] [announcer] Member of parliament, Mr. Knowles, introduced a private member's bill today to call for the release of Steven Truscott. The solicitor general silenced the debate, saying the cabinet will not consider parole until he has served a minimum of 10 years. [older Marlene's voice] I thought about him that Christmas. What... What was he eating for-- for Christmas dinner? He would have to spend three more years in jail, away from his family, and I... I couldn't help him. [announcer] We interrupt this program with an announcement. Steven Truscott was freed from prison today. As a part of his parole, he will have to live under an assumed name somewhere else.

She's on her way to Steven's lawyers, about five minutes away. I invited them for dinner. Steven Truscott is... coming here. Mm. They'll be here in about an hour. [whispering] Oh, my god. [gentle music] [older Marlene's voice] He looked like James Dean, like a man stepping out of a movie that I had been watching inside my head. I remember thinking, "oh my God, "I went to the county road and it was real, "and now the real Steven Truscott was "coming to my house." [deep breath] It was destiny. [Julian] I have over 60 questions, but I want to start with you. The love story. - Hm. - Ah. Well, um, when I first met her, - she was hiding in a closet. - I was not. I-- I was in a closet, but I was not hiding. - [mom] Hi. - [Isabel] Hello. - So nice to meet you in person. - Nice to meet you. - Hello, dear. I didn't see you there. - Hi. - My husband. This is Isabel. - It's Nice to finally meet you. - This is Steven. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Steven, nice to meet you. - Hi. - I can take your coat. - Ah, thank you. [sighs] This is actually at sunset. [gasp] Mm. This is your view? - Out the window? - This is the view, right out the window. - Look. - This is, um, sort of the backyard. I'm gonna... drop something off at my boyfriend's. Do you want to come for a drive? Sure. What should I call you? I can't use your real name, can I? Steven Johnson, say that. It's too bad I have to move to Vancouver. My friend Pinky got a job there and I'm quitting mine. I'm going to Vancouver too. To Rock Creek, to be with my grandparents. The parole board won't let me stay in Ontario. They don't want you here? The press is behind you. They want to silence you. Here... is... my number. If-- If you want to call. Sure. [gentle music] [Marlene] He, uh-- He had no friends his own age and he just was such a-- a lonely person. I-- I wanted to, um... I wanted to bring something bright into his life. [seagulls squawking] [horn blowing] [Marlene's voice] I remember feeling very sorry for him. And it seemed like he was searching for something in his... In his life. When did you notice your feelings changed? Well, uh, my dad come out. Um... and, uh, he and Steve spent a lot of time together, which was nice because, uh, Steve's dad wasn't able to make the trip. And, um... I, just-- I just realized... Um... I felt differently. I, uh... I felt more. [Steven] I asked her on a date. - And she said yes. - No, I did not say yes. I said "that would be nice." - She said yes. - [chuckles] - Seven Seas, remember that? - Yes, a seafood restaurant in North Vancouver, just over the Lions Gate Bridge. I was, um... I was living on Granville. He wore a... [laughing] The boy wore a houndstooth vest and a bow tie. It was my grandfather's. It looked like his grandfather's. - Oh, and then the pea. - Oh, the pea. This pea rolled off my plate and onto the floor. I had to stop it with my foot and I was-- I was trying so hard-- - I barely noticed. - Dainty and all, and he-- You did notice. I was looking at you the whole time. - She looked so beautiful. - [chuckle] - Don't! Just sit down! - [chuckles] Nah. You're gonna crash us. - I think we should put it in the pond. - No, no. Do not! - Seriously, Steven, stop it. - [chuckles] [gentle music] [Marlene laughs, shrieks] - [Marlene] Cut it out! - You're getting good at this. I love you. I love you too. I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna get my stuff and I'm gonna come right back. - Will you? - Yeah. Okay. [Marlene's voice] I gave him my keys, and, uh, he said he would be back in an hour. So I, uh... I waited nervously for him. I was afraid that, um, he might change his mind. [Steven's voice] Not a chance. But I did make her wait a little bit, - just enough to miss me. - [Marlene chuckles] I did. I was nervous too. You know, I might've seemed like a cool customer, - Mm. - but my heart was thumping pretty good. I miss my family so much. Yeah, I know. So do I. I hate the parole board. Want to go home. - You know that I can't go home. You know that. That was a condition of my parole. So we have to just keep hiding? Living a lie? A secret life? What does it mean to not be who you are? Just ask them. Just tell them we want to go home. They don't care what we want. They don't care. Beg them. They can't-- They can't tell you what to do for the rest of your life. Yes, they can. [sigh] Uh... Tell them... I'm pregnant? What? [gentle music] Tell them I'm pregnant. We're gonna have a baby. Hey. Hey, look at me. I just never thought that I was gonna... have that. This is your family now. Okay, this is your family. Baby, I want my family home. Okay. His case nagged at me constantly. Every time I read something small about someone escaping from jail, all I could think about was, uh... - was Steve. - You had to hide the truth? Yeah. We were imposters. Living in hiding, moving every time someone found out that there was a murderer living on the block. Or the parole board called, and... To complain about something Steve hadn't even done. [child crying] Hey, come here, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. I know. It's okay. I know, I know. [sigh] I know. You know, for Steve, he had been in prison and now he was free. But... for me, I was free and... now I was in prison. [calm music] [boy] Cool. Here he comes again. Everybody wave and say - "Hi Dad!" - [All] Hi, Dad! [laughing] [motorcycle approaches, cuts engine] [Steven sniffles, sighs] - Aren't you cold? - Tough. Always the daredevil. - It's-- You know it's minus five. - I felt that. [both laugh] Thank you. Mm. We gotta tell them. The kids. - Marlene, it's not the right time. - Leslie's almost 12. What if they think that I... Leslie asked me why her grandparents have a different last name. - Why Uncle Bill, Aunt Barb? - And what did you say? Well, I told her it's because Grandma remarried. Well, it's not a complete lie. Not the whole truth, either. Just don't want to hurt them. Do you not think when they find out that we lied, that that's going to hurt a hell of a lot more? We'll tell them when they're 14. If you were old enough to hang... then they're old enough to know the truth about their father. Okay. [school bell rings] [dramatic music] [door opens, slams closed] Honey? You lied to me. I know who you are. - Leslie. - I can explain. What did you think I was going to do, call the police? Honey, we were trying to protect you. - It's my fault. - Steven. - It's my- - Stop! - My teacher brought you up in class. - [sigh] He said you were a hero. I want to tell my class who you are, Dad. I love you, Daddy. I love you too. The children found out on their own. Um... Devon found the tape that I had done with Theresa, and Ryan found out at school. He begged his teacher not to do the Truscott unit. [Steven] And the teacher, he asked, uh-- he asked why. [Marlene] Ryan said, "Because it bothers me." [Steven] The teacher, he said, "well it bothers me too." [Marlene] That's when Ryan said, "But it bothers me because he's my dad." - [knocking] - [male voice] Mom? [knocking] I just kept saying over and over and over, the truth does not cease to exist because it is hidden. Jocelyn claimed that Steven asked her to go look for calves in the bushes. Jury thought he was a monster. If not Lynne, then her. Steven denied it. I went back and I looked at Jocelyn's original police statement. There was no mention of Steven asking her to go look for calves. [woman] Did she forget? Or did she make it up? [ominous music] [Marlene's voice] The children used to say if it wasn't on the trail, I didn't know it. I was on that tractor trail morning, noon, and night. [sigh] As if it held a secret that only the tractor trail could tell. Mom? Mom? Prosecution told the jury that there were bicycle tire tracks in the bush. By implication, Steven's. But then by the police's own report, it says that the tracks were dried up in the mud. It hadn't rained in a month. Police also noted that there were fresh car tire tracks. Sergeant wrote that it looked like the car tried to back up - and it had spun out. - Mom. Maybe you should take a break. - Break? Why? - This, all of this. - It never ends. You're not here. - I'm right here. Of course I'm here, I'm your mother. - What do you mean I'm not here? - It's just... Mom... Leslie's having a baby. - I know. - And she's so excited, and you don't even notice. If it doesn't happen on the trail, you don't see it. [airplane flying overhead] The trail was cold. There's no DNA. Presumed destroyed in 1992. Consumed by fire. Officers stayed until everything was gone. They burned the evidence. Samples were sent to London in '59, but... it's all gone. All of it. What a fire it must've been. Without DNA, it will be more difficult. Only four cases have ever made it to trial. We cannot give up. The truth has to come out. The jury has to know that they didn't get the full story, that they withheld evidence. Marlene, Steven has exhausted all of his appeals. We would have to make a proposal - to the justice minister to reopen the case. - Cripes! What more do they want? What we need... is new and compelling evidence. [slow music] [sigh] [clock ticking] [yawning] In the police files, I found a bulletin that was released that night that said Lynne was killed around 9:00 p.m. Steven was home by 8:05 to babysit. It was dark by 9:12. I found a notebook belonging to one of the officers on the case. In all of the notes he took the night of the autopsy, there was no time of death. Why? Because Dr. Penistan didn't give him a time of death. It's the only explanation. If Penistan had determined the time, he would have written the note. - Maybe it was an oversight. - I don't think so. These notes are too detailed. There's no way a cop is going to forget to write down the time of death. If indeed Penistan had come up with an exact time during the autopsy. At the trial, Penistan said that Lynne was killed within the half hour that she was with Steven. - 7:15, 7:45. - So when did he come up with that time? The time that pegged Steven? And who made him change his mind? [dramatic music] The night Lynne disappeared, Bob Lawson and a friend were heading down to the river for a dip. [crickets chirping] And they saw a car parked by the bush on his property. Exactly like the car that Steven had described. And they think they saw a young girl slumped down in the front. When the guy in the car yelled at them, they figured that they'd interrupted some lovers, so they took off. But then that same guy came barreling down the road at them where they were swimming, cursing and swearing as he drove by. After hearing about Lynne's murder, Bob Lawson reported all of this to the guard house on the military base. - It-- It didn't come out in the trial. - Nope. A car that night parked in the bush where Lynne was found. Protect their own. Isn't that the saying? Keep digging. [Marlene's voice] Doris Truscott didn't remember if she'd washed his pants or why there was a scratch on them. They noted her poor housekeeping. The jury noted Steven was silent at the trial. Remorseless, cold, a cold blooded killer, and it was Doris Truscott's fault. On his birthday, the Truscotts showed Steven his present. A card, a birthday cake, and a watch. His father held it up to show him. No presents were allowed. During the trial, the Truscotts were moved off the base, 300 miles away to Ottawa. After the trial, Steven was taken to Goderich Jail to await his fate. [Marlene's voice] The judge declared he be kept in isolation, a five by six foot cell with one window. All that changed when his older brother climbed up the tree to wave to him. When the guards found out, Steven was moved to a cell with no windows. His family was allowed to see him for one hour a month. They divided this into two half hours. [Marlene] Um... - [Steven] I think my luck's changing. - I think... [Marlene] I think you... are about to lose for the... third time? - Well, if someone's counting. - [laughing] Steve, I need to ask you something. When you were... Did you really believe... that you would hang? Yep. [Marlene's voice] The dam broke the following spring. As with most floods, it began as just a trickle, small crack in the silence. Silence that had always been part of our married life. Never talk about it, leave it in the darkness. Don't hurt the family. Can you tell me... what it was like? One day you're living a normal life... and the next you're in a cell waiting to be hung. It was like being dropped in a foreign country where no one knows English and everyone speaks a foreign language. I just kept wondering, "what's happening?" Where's my parents? I told them that my name was Steven Truscott. And they said, "You're not going to need that here." And they gave me a uniform... and a number. Told me to sew it on. [indistinct prisoner chatter] I remember they were building something on the other side of the prison. All day, I could hear the sound of banging. [hammering] [sawing] And I thought they were building my gallows. And then... Then, one day, the sound stopped. And I thought they were coming to get me. I could hear the sound of the guard coming toward me. [footsteps, jangling keys] And I thought, "this is it." They're gonna hang me. I found out afterward that they were just doing some construction outside the prison, but no one told me that. No one told me. Oh! I'm so sorry. [both crying] [Marlene's voice] In the next period of time, Steven Truscott will be seen at some length to try and understand the fundamental motives for his offense. Perhaps Steven had attempted to kiss Lynne, and when she fought back, he tried to stop her from screaming, accidentally strangling her. I hereby authorize you to carry out any psychological assessments deemed necessary. Truth serum. Repressed memory. LSD. How was your swim? Are you okay? Marlene? [Marlene sighs] They never believed you. They never believed you. Not one of them. I found a file. Dr. Scott, Collins Bay. He made my life a living hell. LSD? How many times? - I don't remember. - Steve! Why? Because my mum asked me to. What? I made a pact with the devil. I don't understand. What do you mean? My mum wanted me to get parole. And she knew they wouldn't give it to me unless we did everything the doctor wanted. Oh, God. So I did it. I'm sorry. He signed your parole letter. Didn't he? What was it like? The LSD? It was like uh... Like a long dream. There are these lights. - Lights? - Yeah, these flashing lights. They were like lights you've never seen before. [Steven groans] [slow music] You know that I'm sorry? Sorry about what? Sorry that I made you relive just one moment of it. Don't be. I would do it all again if I knew you were waitin' on the other side for me. I love you. You know that I love you? That I do. - I love you, Steven Murray Truscott. - Mm. [Theresa] A week before Lynne was murdered, a man tried to lure a girl into his car. He promised her new panties, and... even showed her the pair he had hidden under his seat. The father reported it to the police, but they let him go. A few weeks later, he was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward and the doctor noted that he was traumatized by guilt. He sold his car two weeks after Lynne was killed. Marlene, there were other suspects. The police never bothered to look into anyone else... - but Steven. - Why? Why were they going after a 14 year old boy? Wh-- The way Lynne was f-- found, [hesitating] so methodical... like a sick ritual. They should've been looking for a predator. Donna Dunkin claimed she saw Philip Burns and Richard Gellatly leave the road at the same time, Richard on a bike, Philip on foot. Richard said he saw Steven and Lynne here. Philip did not see them. The prosecution said it's because Steven had already taken Lynne into the bush, - where he murdered her. - Steven? That's me. I know. I didn't know that boy. I have to distance myself. [Marlene] No one ever saw them go onto that trail. It's completely circumstantial evidence. So they had to prove Steven was guilty by who didn't see them on the road that night. If we can't get rid of Philip not seeing them, then we can't get rid of the case. He left school... 7:25 with Lynne. He came... By 7:30. 7:30. His mother confirmed it. Donna Dunkin said she saw them at seven, no more than 10 feet apart. Two other witnesses put Philip's departure around seven, while Richard left on his bike at 7:15 or 7:20. Donna Dunkin was the only witness who claimed that they left together. Philip dove into water, dressed, walked home. At the school yard, 7:25. 7:25 or 7:30, Steven and Lynne start up the road, passed Richard Gellatly, 7:25, 7:05, 7:15, 7:10, 7:15. [Marlene's voices overlapping] The times were wrong. The times were wrong. [Marlene] What if it was all wrong? What if it was based on bad timing, flawed logic, and poor eyewitness accounts? Philip didn't see Steven and Lynne on a bike because he left 20 minutes before Richard. Philip didn't see them because he was already at home. I'm going to need to interview you on camera. Well, that's Steve's decision. - Where would we do this interview? - Our studio. I'd like to take you back to the county road. That's where your whole life changed. I just want the truth. Okay, ready to roll? And action. [TV host] In a Goderich, Ontario jail cell, he awaited the hang man. He was 14. In 1959, when a 12-year-old girl disappeared - on a hot June evening, - Turn up the volume. An investigation lasting less than two days, and a trial of less than two weeks, sent a 14-year-old school boy on his way to the gallows. Steven Truscott's murder trial was the most famous and infamous child criminal case in Canadian history. His death sentence was commuted, but he spent 10 years in prison. Since his release, Truscott has lived a secret life under an assumed name, shunning all publicity until now. Tonight, he breaks that 40 year silence. [Steven on TV] It's important to me. I know they got the wrong person. My kids are all grown up. We've discussed it as a family, and we figured it was time to come out. [host] If Steven and Lynne crossed the bridge, he could not have killed her in the bush. [man] I saw both of them. Well, couldn't see one of them without the other, but they were both-- They were riding double on Steve's bike across the river. No doubt in your mind about it? There is absolutely no doubt in my mind. If your memory is sharp, then Steven Truscott is innocent. I don't know how anybody could have come to any other conclusion. [man 2] I don't think there is any medical or forensic evidence which clearly links Steven Truscott with Lynne Harper's death. [host] The police and the pathologist at the time allot. - Well... [clears throat] - They told them that she died sometime between 7:15 and 7:30 on the night of June the 9th. Under the best of circumstances, determination of time of death of a dead body may be very difficult, if not impossible. [host] Did you ever have any doubt that, my gosh, there's a dark side to my father that I didn't know about? [Leslie] No. Never. My dad is the most laid back, relaxed person I've ever met in my life. And sure, everything he went through with all the time in jail and that really molded the wonderful person that he's become. [Devon] I just couldn't imagine all of my rights being taken away from me. People talk about heroes all the time, and "who do you admire?" and "who is your hero, in your life?" And we don't have to go anywhere but our house. [host] ...why it's so important for you guys as a couple, as a family, to keep pursuing this? Whether he did it or not, he's scot-free. He did his time. He owes nothing to society. He's not scot-free. He goes to bed every night as a convicted murderer and he wakes up every morning as a convicted murderer. And why should he be? Justice hasn't been done. Not to the Harper family, and not to my family. It's all I want. After 40 years, I don't think that's too much to ask. [Marlene's voice] It was a strange feeling, watching yourself. Like looking in the mirror and not recognizing your own face. But for me, it was the beginning of the vindication. I could taste justice. I just can't believe how-- how many there are. [Marlene reading] "Dear Marlene and Steven Truscott, "I live in France now, but while visiting my family in Toronto, "I managed to catch the in-depth report on this long ago, "but not forgotten case for many Canadians. "I remember it like it was only yesterday. "We accused him and threw him away, "hoping that we would never have to hear "about this case again. "What an injustice we have done to your family. "But like it or not, Steven Truscott, "you have become a Canadian icon for young people. "You do not have to clear your name." That's nice. [James] Okay, so here's what's been happening. We made an application to the minister of justice, pursuant to section 690, for relief against Steven's conviction on a charge of first degree murder. Now we made this ministerial application on the grounds of a miscarriage of justice. The justice minister, Irwin Cotler, appointed a justice, Fred Kaufman, to review the application. And now the good news. - They've reopened the case. - Yes! [gentle music] In 1959, Steven Truscott was charged with the murder of 12-year-old Lynne Harper. Today we have filed a 700 page brief to challenge that verdict. The jury never got anything like the full story. And we have new evidence that was never shown at the time of the trial or the appeal. [reporters overlapping with questions] All I want them to say is that they made a mistake. I'm not asking for the world. What they did was wrong. Who is accountable for what happened to my husband? If he had been 16 instead of 14 in 1959, he would not be standing here today. [announcer] Today, it was announced Fred Kaufman was appointed to look at the Truscott case to see whether there was enough new evidence to require another trial, a hearing, or a pardon. [Marlene's voice] This was a very good day for us, for everyone who believed in Steve's innocence. Well? Been asked to write a book. A book? - About what? - Steven. You. Whole story. What do you need? They left from... went over the bridge. Found. Somebody's lying. This is a memo written by Dr. Penistan in 1966, as the Supreme Court was about to hear Steven's case. In the memo, he changed the time of death. - He said it could have been much later. - Much later? Steve lost that appeal. He spent another three years in jail. You need to hear this. "The other unofficial version of the autopsy report "gives Lynne's time of death as between 4:45 a.m. "and 10:45 a.m. on June 10th. In other words, "if Lynne's death occurred during either timeframes that I had originally noted, "then Steven could not have been the killer." It says it's an agonizing reappraisal. They didn't call Penistan up during that appeal. Called eight other doctors, but not-- not him. Penistan took this to the police. - What? - They buried it. They made sure the Supreme Court never heard that the doctor whose testimony had so influenced the jury had changed his mind. They almost hung him for that! [door slams] Why would they do this to me? It was a mad rush to justice. - If that's justice, I don't understand the word, Marlene. Your case was a time bomb, Steve. The truth would have blown the whole thing open. - Why are you defending them, Marlene? - I am not defending them! - I am not defending them! - You're defending them, Marlene! God-- Steve, I'm sorry. [sniffles] I'm going for a ride. [door slams] [whimpering] [slow music] - Mm. More chicken? - No. - You've heard nothing? - No. They're not going to give Steven a fair trial. Yes. Yes, they are. We have more lawyers than you can shake a stick at and Steve and I are very optimistic, aren't we? - These things take time, Doris. - Do they? How long has it been since the report went to Kaufman? Two years? - Three? - Two. Two years. It's never going to end. [slow music] [Marlene's voice] Julian called them my dark years, the years of waiting. Darkness so thick, I barely saw my way out of it. [sighs] Steve! Steve! James called. Kaufman finished his report. He said you didn't get a fair trial. He says it's not enough to demonstrate innocence, so it's not a pardon. More likely a miscarriage of justice. - [grunt] - [laughing] [Steven sighs heavily] Oh. Federal justice minister, Irwin Cotler, has to review it. And then we got to wait for his ruling, but... oh, I feel it, Steve. We're going to get a new trial. Thank you, Marlene. Thank you. [laughing] [Marlene] We did it. We did it. I'm so excited, I can't stand it. Look at this cake. - What time are people coming over for the celebration? - Five. This is it, Steve. I can feel it. This is-- This is what we've been waiting for. What time did the justice minister say he would call? - Oh, it should be any minute now. - [phone ringing] It's a nice cake. Hello, this is Steven. Okay. Thank you for calling. Cotler wants to send it to the court of appeal for review. [hesitating] The court-- For a review? I-- Uh-uh. The same court that betrayed you before? No. Uh, no No, they-- They... We told them we wanted a new trial. They knew-- They knew we wanted a new trial. He said it could take three years. No. No, no, no. I won't. No. Can't! [slow music] - Excuse me. - Over here! - We're with the Herald. - Excuse me. [reporter] Can you tell us how you feel? - Please? - [reporter 2] Please, just a comment. [reporter] Over here! [reporters continue questioning] [knocking on window] [reporter 2] Mrs. Truscott, please, just a few questions. Well, that's it. [plane engine overhead] [announcer] ...yesterday, and are 1100 for the event. - [fanfare] - [digital assistant] Your news team is next. Respected journalist Isabel LeBourdais died yesterday at the age of 92. She suffered from Alzheimer's. Ms. LeBourdais was best known as the author of the 1966 book, "The Trial of Steven Truscott." Ms. LeBourdais was seen as a courageous crusader, a woman ahead of her time, who dared to say the justice system was fallible. [announcer] Fighting broke out overnight between rival factions along the Israeli-Syrian border... [slow music] [door creaks] [squeaking] [imagined prison sounds] [phantom thud] [gasps] [phantom hammering, sawing] [phantom prisoner chatter] James will call us in the morning. Press conference is at four. I told my mum not to come. It's a long drive from Ottawa, and her heart's not good. - And what if it doesn't turn out well for us? - It will. Mac called. Said he's praying for us. That's nice. You know what I see? I see... people all over the world... standing up, raising their hands for Steven Truscott. I, uh... I have a dream... I've dreamt it for so long... that when we arrive for the announcement, we put our hands up in the victory sign for all the world to see. This time, we will win. [phone ringing] Hello, this is Steven. Yep. Thanks. Steve! What did they say? Steve? It's over. I've been exonerated. [laughing] - I love you. - I love you too, Marlene. [lively music] Isn't this great? [crowd murmuring] [crowd cheering] [man] Way to go, Steven! - [man] Congratulations! - [woman] Congratulations! [overlapping congratulations] Excuse me. [man] Great job, buddy! Great job! Excuse me. [Marlene's voice] I thought about walking and walking and never coming back. People ask "How did it happen?" I was just carried away on a wave like Steve. One damn thing, that's all. That's all I wanted was that victory sign for all the world to see. [slow music] [♪] [James] Steven Truscott has been on a 48 year journey, more than any of us could ever imagine. A journey for truth and justice. Out of the darkness, and into the light. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you... Steven Truscott! A freed man! Marlene? Would you please come join me? [Marlene laughs] [audience applauds] [man] Way to go, Steven! [triumphant music] [gentle music]
