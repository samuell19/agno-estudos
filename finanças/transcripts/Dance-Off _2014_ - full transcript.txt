(Brandon) When I was 10, I loved to dance. I had a crush on my duet partner, Jasmine. That's us. We won many first place overall at competition after competition. I thought we were unstoppable. But life quickly became about more than just winning platinums. (Jasmine) Brandon, wait! Don't go! Wait for me! Brandon! Brandon! Don't go! Wait!

(drumroll) (laughing) Diamond Dance and the fabulous freaky mama! (cheering) This sucks, they win every time! You know? And it's not because of their dancing. (cheering) Their daddies have so much money, they probably buy off the judges. Look, just face it. They have dance lessons. No, I ain't buyin' it. Those skinny you-know-what's dance like--like robots. Like, (mocking) "Oh my god, Oh my god." You better stop. You know what Mr. Ray always says. What? Uh, hold a bake sale? Recycle? He says, "Support your fellow dancers." Work! (laughs) Well, if he thinks I'm gonna tell those snotty $600-costume-wearing Barbies that they did a good job, then Mr. Ray's on crack. (clapping, applause) No way. (cheering) What? (cheering continues) Nothing, just thought I saw someone I know. Yeah well, no one worth knowing on this stage but us. Okay? Yeah, yeah, no, you're right. Can't stand them.

Let's take it from the corner. (London) Mommy, my tights have a hole. I'm watching your sister. Be quiet. She has holes in her tights. Oh my god, they're gonna think we have the studio discount. Order a gross of tights, maybe a palette. Is a palette bigger than a gross? (Siri) Queenie, Apple is bigger than everything. Stop picking that! That's the only pair you're having. Why is this leotard too small? Did Marta wash it again? It's supposed to be handwashed. It's not shrinking, is it? (grunts) Mom, your breath stinks! (gasps) What do you mean? Does it really? I haven't got anything... Gather, girls. Gather, gather. Guess what, Mom? I heard that Julia got a dance studio for her tenth birthday! Shh! Wait... what? Yeah! Her parents turned the garage into a dance studio for her. Can we do that please, please, please? A dance studio in the garage? Absolutely not! No. We'll build another room, maybe an entire floor. (gasps) Call contractor, inform husband. (Siri) Okay, calling tractor for husband. (laughs) (dance music playing) (Radio) We're pushing almost 100 degrees in downtown LA today, folks. Time to get those ACs fired up. Traffic backed up on the 101, per the usual, (rapping rhythmically) and the bad parts of town just keep getting worse, but come on! Who's really surprised anyway? (dog panting) So get up, get out, unglue your face from your TVs and dance the day away. That's right. This one's for all those tappers out there. Keep those feet high and that head up. (clears throat) - Survey says... - (dart lands) (chuckles) (clears throat) Winner every time! Mr. Ray, come quick! (sighs) What happened? I don't know. I think a pipe exploded? Ahh crap! Ew! Gross. Where? (water trickling) Well, how can I pay for this, and get the kids to nationals? (sighs) We need more money or this studio is sunk. Literally. Dad, guess what? Mom's gonna build a dance studio in the house. With a harlequin floor and everything! And how much is this going to cost me? Harlequin floor, twenty thousand. Lights, mirrors, sound system, eighteen hundred more. Jasmine dancing on Broadway...priceless. My girls are worth it. Yeah! Jasmine really needs the practice space. Yeah, London too. No, of course. London's welcome to use it when you're not. Which will be the first of never. Did I say that out loud? Mom, why are you always so rude? (under breath) Mm, we heard that. You know what? Enough about dance. Lets talk ice cream! No! I am in the mood for a ginormous sundae. With sprinkles? (Dad) Double sprinkles. You know what? Strike that. Triple sprinkles. No. Eat fruit instead. No bananas or grapes--too much sugar. Maybe a grapefruit. - Well, half. - (Dad) You her that, girls? That is the sugar nazi. Fortunately for us, I don't speak zee German. (Thomas chuckles) - Dad, that was terrible. - (JoAnn) Pretty much. Go easy on the girls. Tell me about your next competition. Umm, Inspired to Dance is coming, so we'll never have a chance against them. Well, we'll just have to do something about that. (sniffs, sneezes) Ooh, muffins! (girls chatter excitedly) (kids screaming) Brandon. What do you say? That one or that one? - (Simone) Yo, Brandon! - What? What? Sorry. Really? Her again? She is the worst one of all! Really? And how do you know that? Because I can just tell by looking at her. Wow! You know, you can actually see the end of the stick just poking out of her. So gross. Where are you going? The car. I gotta feed the meter. Okay well, we've been standing in this line, like, all day, so hurry up. Yeah, I know. It'll be quick. - Seriously! - It'll be quick. Okay. All right, which one? Purple, gold, blue, teal, go! - (dart lands) - Here. Try again. All right, let's see. Get purple, up top. Purple. - (London) Okay. - No. (Jasmine) Oh. Yeah. - Oh. - (London squeaks) Hey Jasmine. - Long time no see. - Excuse me. I don't know if you remember me... I remember what a jerk you are. (dart lands) Hey, I think you need a napkin. Yeah? I'll be right here when you get back. Go. You have some nerve talking to me after what you did. What I did? You were the one who didn't even.... Who what? Ask my dad to help you pay your bills so that you could stay? You made me and my mom feel like crap by asking your dad to open his wallet. I was your friend! You made us feel like a charity case. You couldn't even keep in touch? I didn't even know where you were. It doesn't even matter anymore. Here you go. I'm over it. C'mon kiddo, let's go. Let's go, girl. - Who is that? - (Jasmine) Nobody important. (Jasmine) We're good. Are you riding by yourself, miss? Um...no, I'm good. Thanks. - Hi. What are you looking at? - Look. Oh, look. Oh, I remember that. Oh, you've got such beautiful cheekbones. Mine. You should wear your hair up more often, though. It really shows them off. Here. Put it up. Go on, go on. Don't make me do it. You see? So much better. You know my motto-- mother knows everything. (chuckles) Dinner's almost ready. (dance music playing) What the hell was that? It's nothing. It's just, uh... It's an old routine, I can't really remember. You're better off that way, trust me. What? Come on, twinkle toes, that is not gonna win you a platinum at nationals.

We are about to make a major, unprecedented announcement that will change dancers' lives forever, guaranteed. And here to tell you all about it, it gives me great pride and pleasure to introduce the founder of the Circle Star Nationals. - Here is Mary Buttle. - (applause) Thank you so much for that wonderful introduction. You're an absolute angel! Don't tell anyone, but you're my favourite. It is now my very great honor and privilege to extend a very special invitation to an event of unprecedented taste and talent. It's going to be for the best of the best, the cream of the crop, the elite of the elite. And I call it National Nationals. I hope so! (audio cuts out, crowd mumbles) (phone rings) You know, nobody can hear you. We can't hear at all. Don't touch the hair! - (microphone feedback) - Hello? (beep) All right, uh... Mary Buttle there. Uh... Now, only two studios will get to compete for the top honor, - the platinum platinum. - (crowd murmurs) With this award comes the honor of being known as the best in the country and a $25,000 prize. - (crowd murmurs) - Ready to hear who they are? The two studios invited to compete for the platinum platinum are... Diamond Dance... (all cheer) and Shockwave Studio! (Mary) I told you not to touch me! You people are idiots! Webster has to invent a new word for your brand of stupid. Where is my idiot son? (jazz music playing, tap shoes tapping) Wow! Your feet can really move. Why aren't you on Broadway? Well, (sighs) I was on Broadway. Man, it was awesome. But what are you doing here so late? Shouldn't you be packing for National Nationals? (Brandon sighs, Mr. Ray chuckles) Hey, heartbroken sighs are my second language. Spill it. She was my duet partner. At Diamond Dance, back when I lived here. She was my first crush. Anyways, when my dad bolted, we lost the house. Moved away and never even got the chance to say goodbye. Did you keep in touch? No, no, I didn't even know she was still dancing, let alone at her old studio. Totally ran into our competition. Okay, have you tried getting in touch with her, - now that you found her again? - No, she hates me. (dance music playing) What are you doing wasting a moment of your life looking at him? (mumbles) - Sorry, can you enunciate? - I think he's really good! Oh please, let me see. Give it to me, give it. - Why does he look familiar? - 'Cause it's Brandon. - We used to dance together. - Oh, that Brandon. - You know others? - That was so sad. After her husband left, he took all their money, and we never spoke again. They were broke, not lepers. What's the difference? Clearly he didn't keep up with his training. He's the new soloist at Shockwave. I would say that he's pretty good. How am I supposed to know that? I can't look at anyone else when you're on stage. What about when I'm not? Well, when you're not, it's too hard to watch other dancers and listen to people tell me how good you are at the same time. You shouldn't be watching anything. Come on. Let's stretch. Have you stretched tonight? Let's go. Let's go. - (JoAnn) Up, up. - (London) Will you stretch my leg too? Come on, kiddo. Come up. (JoAnn) Why don't you show her some sit-ups? - Those she could use. - (Jasmine) Mom, stop! You don't have to be a toothpick to be a good dancer, you know. You just have to have a strong body. Besides, you know what they always tell me at convention? - What? - Performance and personality. And you have those in spades. I wish I danced like you. Aww, take a number. Come on, I need you to wash that chocolate off your face. You know what I say-- yes sugar, no scholarship. Come on! Stay away from that boy. I have Tammy from Tammy's Tap 'n Twirl on line 1. She heard that all 17 kids from Inspires Dance Experience have come down with the chicken pox. Germy little things. Doesn't anyone vaccinate their children anymore? How many kids did Tammy bring to my convention last year? Uh... Get me a copy of her registration sheet. Thank you. Find me the correct page! And get my idiot son on the phone. Convention classes, unlimited solos, group numbers, wood pads, videos, pictures. (laughs) (phone rings) Ow! Ow! (assistant whimpers, Mary mutters) Ahh! Mama's going back to Shanghai in a new pair of Louboutins. Tammy, my angel, how are you? Wonderful to hear from you. - (Tammy) Did you hear? - Yes, I know. All 17 of them. - It's just tragic. - Chicken pox... Well, they're all going to be disfigured. I mean, the scarring alone... - I know! - Let me ask you, Do you still have 90 kids in your company? 94 actually. Well then, let me be the first to welcome you to National Nationals. Fantastic, we'll see you there. (dial tone) - (music playing) - (Brandon) No... No. Ah, here she is. I'll take that! Look, my father will kill me if I don't come home with my phone. He slept outside overnight to get it. (Simone scoffs, laughs) (Simone) Um, who are you talking to anyways? 'Cause the only person you need to be talking to... is right here. No talking! No talking! Now, changement. Please. Okay! Okay! (breathes deeply) How about relevés? Just a moment, class. - Wow! - Okay. This studio is so broke. Yeah, yeah it is. And I think class is over. Peace. Hey man, let's just go. Wait. Aren't we supposed to learn new choreo for National Nationals? Um, Dancing in the Dark is just a song. Nobody actually does it. Hello? And you know, if things keep going like this, then we're never gonna make it to National Nationals. So stupid. - (soft music playing) - (chuckles) Wow, another new unitard from Katrinawear? Jeez Jas, did you buy their entire website? Wow! Jealous much? Especially when you and I both know that you're going to be wearing that exact same one tomorrow. - Whatevs. - Ladies! Ladies! We have two weeks until National Nationals. We have a lot to do. (JoAnn clears throat) What's she doing here? Just living her life through me. Well, maybe she just came to pay this month's tuition. Get in formation! (music changes) Five, six, seven, eight! Sarah! One, two... What is this? Why is Jasmine in the back? You know she's your best dancer. She should be in center, not splitting it either. Oh well, you know the section they're doing is a formation change, so... What, so it's safe to assume that then she'll come in front? Absolutely. Well, glad we're on the same page. Mm-hmm! Continue! Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait! What is this? Uh... She just did a triple. You know that she can do at least six turns. Oh, we know! We know that Jas is a fabulous turner. - She's a fabulous turner! - Fabulous! But we only need three here and they need to be clean, so... What are you insinuating? That she falls out of her turns? (Sarah) Oh, no, no! She's... Mom, please, you're embarrassing me. How? I'm looking after my best interest...your best interest. Exactly. Well, you know my motto. You stay quiet, you stand in the back, right? Jas gets nervous when you watch. What? Is she talking to me? Yeah, maybe you should...leave. Oh, my god! You see? She speaks. Maybe that's why she's in the front. Just a thought. (footsteps receding) (gasps) Oops! Wow, coming to my rescue twice in one day? You feeling okay? I'm only being nice so you don't quit. I can't beat you if you're not here. It's very true. Ladies, can we get back to rehearsal? And it would be nice if we could spend less time on our personal business and more with our eyes on the prize. Your mom loves you, you know. I just wished she loved me a little bit less. (breathes deeply) Every other Thursday would be nice. Formation! - Hey. Hi. - (groans) Two parents are threatening to yank their kids 'cause they can't afford the costume fee for the lyrical number. DIY it. Black bottoms, red on top. Thanks. Next? (sighs) There's a phonecall for you! Which idiot is it now? I mean... Who is it? Ray from Shockwave Studios. Swell. His kids have probably come down with mono. Ray darling, how wonderful to hear from you. Mary, thank you so much for taking my call. I'm calling about National Nationals. Our studio is... - (pipe bursts) - (Boy) Oh, not again! Mr. Ray, come quick! Mr. Ray! We're having some serious financial problems. Is there...any way you could cut us a break? Ray, I really wish I could help, but this is the convention business. I understand. Hey, you know, thanks for taking my-- - (phone beeps) - Is that a studio with a problem? If you call a distinct inability to pay a problem, then yes! But NMP--not my problem. What studio was it? Shock Me...Shoot Me... Shout Out..... - Shockwave Studios? - Yes. But those kids are fantastic. You can tell they love it! Right. What you seem to be forgetting is that we are running the convention business, not the convention charity. If you can't pony up the cash, then stay home and watch Dancing With the Stars. Is there some reason you're here? I thought I'd take you out to lunch. Take me? As in, you'll pick up the check? (sighs) Yeah. I didn't think I paid you enough for that. All right. Glad to be wrong. (clears throat) Let me go freshen up. (Assistant) You are radiant like the sun... (Mary) Yes, I know. I'm radiant. You know, you're like a gypsy child, just pawing me for coins. What are you still doing here? Why aren't you in your car, getting your air condition all revved up? You know how I hate sticking to leather. Yes, Mother. "Mary" is just fine. Or God. (motorcycle revving) What are you doing here? I just thought I'd check out the old hood. - The hood? - (Brandon scoffs) Why don't you drop the gangster act, white boy? What are you working on so late? I'm auditioning for school, and I have to... make up a solo, so... I know, it's dumb. No, it's not. It's what we talked about when we were kids. You were gonna go to college, and I was going to... Dance in music videos. Yeah. Um...I'll just go. You left without saying goodbye. You didn't say goodbye before I left. Because I was a little kid and my ride was late. It's not like I could just drive myself to your house. You could have tried harder. And you could have told your mom to wait! Like my mom would have listened to me. All she did back then was drink and cry, and drink some more. Is that how you remembered it? Some things. (music begins playing) May I? (Jasmine) Guess your time's up. (light switch clicks, JoAnn applauds) (JoAnn) Bravo! Wow! I didn't know they just let anybody in here these days. Mom, you remember Brandon, right? Of course I do! Hi, dear. Hi. Here's some money. For the bus. Go get in the car. We need to leave. Your father will deal with you when we get home. Hurry up. (no audio) Listen up, 'cause I'm just going to say this once. Stay away from my daughter. You're not good enough for her. Not then, and not now. Got it? She doesn't seem to have a problem with me. I know, she has this kind of fairytale notion about who you were. But I know what you are. Be a man, walk away. Just like your father. Don't you need that money? Have I ever told you how proud I am of you? Only everyday. Here. Buy yourself a T-shirt or something at convention. Mom, that's really sweet of you, but a T-shirt is like 40 bucks. Well, you're halfway there. This is special. You deserve this. - I'll miss you. - Mmm. Okay. (dance music playing) (Sarah) Ladies, ladies! Let's go, come on! Break is over. Jas? Excuse me! We interrupting something? Ew. Why are you following him? What do you mean by "him"? Him. The kid we're gonna smoke at Con. I don't know, have you seen him dance lately? Wait. Are you watching his YouTube videos? Girls. Do you like him or something? (mocking) Girls. No, I don't like him or something. (girls snicker) No, I don't like him! I don't like him! I'm just, like, studying his moves, like... watching his moves... (Sarah) Ladies, ladies, ladies! Huddle up, huddle up. Ladies. (takes deep breath) All right. It is important that you get a good night's sleep. Don't stay up eating a bag of hot Cheetos and Dr. Pepper. Eat to fuel your bodies. And make sure that you have all your costumes and accessories. Extra hair pins and gels. All of your shoes and clothes for the convention classeses. Be here at 9 AM sharp. - Diamonds? - (Hope) Let's do this! (all snap fingers) (no audio) - Who are you looking for? - Nobody. Oh, nobody. Yeah, I don't know her. - Hey! - Im looking for Jas. Okay... You know, you have, like, no chance with anybody from that team, right? ♪ All the guys up in the club are looking for us ♪ ♪ They can look but they can't touch us ♪ ♪ Let me take you home ♪ ♪ Let me take you home ♪ ♪ Let me take you home ♪ ♪ All you guys just sound the same ♪ ♪ Let me take you home ♪ Hey Prada, meet pathetic. (girls giggling, chattering) These kids are clueless. Always have to tell them what to do. And their parents are even worse. Speaking of which: listen and repeat. - (microphone feedback) - Listen and repeat. What did I just say? - Listen and repeat. - Exactly. Just do it my way and everything will go fine. Remember, I'll be up there. Watching. (sighs) Welcome everyone to the first annual National Nationals! (applause, cheers) We have an exciting three days of dancing planned for you... ...followed by the quest for the ultimate dance award, the platinum... ...platinum. Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! - (applause dwindling) - What in the world? Stop that, you idiot. No, not you. You keep going. I'm talking to you now. Now I'm talking to the audience. Remember! This event is going to be televised, so make sure everyone at home watches so they can cheer you on to victory! Can you hear me? And don't forget! The whole thing is going to be on TV! And don't forget about the grand prize! (whispers) Wait. (no audio) And the $25,000 grand prize for the winners! I was pausing for effect! Don't think and talk, just repeat! - What are you doing? - Sorry. - Technical difficulties. - Put your ear piece back in. Put your ear piece back in! (no audio) I'm gonna kill you. I'm just gnna kill you! I'm gonna choke you, and... I know! Fun times, yes! Yes! So, classes are about to start. Let's just everyone have a great day of dancing! (applause) Well, you could have really screwed that up. Sorry, Mother. Technical difficulties. Check your equipment better. Now I need you to make sure this thing runs on time! Don't let any of the kids or the parents take too many photographs after class. What do you want me to do? Body-check them out of the way? Yes! If that's what it takes. Of course, maybe we should be charging to take photos with the instructors. Why do you let her bully you like that? Because she's my boss. And she's also misunderstood. She's also your mother. She shouldn't talk to you like that. (sighs) Hey, I'm on your side, you know? I know. Let's just discuss this later. I have to make sure the classes run on time.

Looks like someone's already sitting there. Oh, God...well... there! Looks like it's free after all. (laughs) I can't believe this! Oh! Mom? - I'm hungry. - You're always hungry. Stop whining. It's so unattractive. - But I'm hungry! - Just go! Go stand in the front, and that way the teachers will notice you. But I don't like the front, and I'll just mess up the combos anyway! Stop whining! Maybe you won't mess up the combos if you paid attention. Why aren't you wearing the team jackets like the other moms? Because polyester gives me hives. Now go. Go, get, go! (tap shoes tapping) Ballet shoes. Go! If there is one thing that I hate, it's sickle feet. When I say "sickle," you say "ew." - Sickle! -Ew! - Sickle! - Ew! Perfect. Now everyone put your right foot out in front and point it really hard. Let me see it, let me see it. Don't sickle! - (girls) Ew! - Good! Look at London compared to the other kids. She gets bigger by the day, I swear. The first call im gonna make when we get home is to Weight Watchers. (laughs) Oh, my God! The child is ten! I'm sure they have a kids menu. A kids menu! (laughs, snorts) (sighs) She's never gonna get a solo looking like that! I don't know. I had a lot of solos when I was younger. I guess you looked like that too. Yeah, with red hair. - (JoAnn) What? - (Friend) No, nothing. - It's low carb. - Oh! - Mm-hmm. It's paleo. - Oh! Hunters, gatherers. - Would you hold that for me? - Oh, sure. I'm gonna go check on the seniors room. This is like water torture, you know what I mean? Yeah. Wow! Eighties Workout Malibu Barbies. You guys must be like special edition, right? You're so classy. Clearly you're in the wrong room. This is for advanced dancers. Fight club is down the hall. (laughing) (Jasmine) Relax. Hey, calm down. We're all just here to dance, right? Right, right. So ladies, why don't we handle this on the floor, like real dancers? (Simone) Okay. - (Simone) All right, Josh! - (Hope) Small space. - Whoo! - (Simone laughs) - Oh, really? - (all talking at once) - She's got great legs! - Okay, yeah, great. A little stiff but it's cool. (all) Ohhh! It's hot when we drop it. (dancers cheering) That was good. Where she at, where she at? Oh, excuse me? Barbie? Uh, see, the turn was on three. We're in an advanced dance class? Slow math is down the hall. - Oh! - (dancers cheering) (Simone) Sorry! One, two, three. Do you know how to count? - Whoo! That was quick. - (JoAnn) Mm. Mom, I'm tired! Aw, I'm sure! What has it been? - (gasps) All of seven minutes! - (Friend laughs) I'm tired! Aw, you're tired, you're hungry. Do you know what you're not? Dancing. Now go! (Teacher) Take it from the top. Here we go, one, two, three, four, open five, six, first arabesque, hold that pose. Arm directly across from your nose. Good, good, good. (JoAnn) What is she doing? Wow, those are some nice splits, but I don't think we have any in this combo. Everybody look at her. Go, go. Up! Just kidding with you. All right, here we go. From the top again! Five, six, seven, we have one, two, three, four, open five... (Friend) Well, if it causes her to get called out! - (laughing, snorting) - I swear... That child is going to be the death of me. If I don't kill her first. What are you doing? I just wanted a second, to myself. - Are you okay? - I'm great, thanks. Sometimes I feel like I'm suffocating. - Yeah. - Yeah. Hey, I think I found something you might like. Come on, I've got ten minutes before rehearsal. One, two, three. What is it? What do you mean? It's a really cool warehouse. I thought you'd like it. You don't like it? - This is creepy! What in the world? - No, it's so cool. I know it's not Diamond Dance, but I thought you'd think it was cool. - I brought music. - Yeah. It's like...(laughs) It's nice. ♪ I got my own thing going on ♪ ♪ I don't need anyone to tow along ♪ ♪ But no matter what I'm tryin' to do ♪ ♪ I can't stop running into you ♪ ♪ Now everywhere I seem to be ♪ ♪ It's like I see you looking back at me ♪ ♪ I don't know how this could be happening ♪ ♪ But something's tellin' me it must be a sign ♪ ♪ 'Cause every single day ♪ ♪ I see you smiling back at me ♪ ♪ It's something that could only mean ♪ ♪ It must be a sign ♪ ♪ 'Cause when I walk away ♪ ♪ I feel you pulling back at me ♪ ♪ And suddenly it's clear to me ♪ ♪ It must be a si-i-ign ♪ ♪ 'Cause when I walk awa-a-ay ♪ ♪ I feel you pulling back at me ♪ ♪ And suddenly it's clear to me ♪ ♪ It must be a sign ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ But now I know it must be a sign ♪ ♪ 'Cause when I walk away ♪ ♪ I feel you pulling back at me ♪ ♪ And suddenly it's clear to me ♪ ♪ It must be a sign ♪ This floor is so scuffed. It just looks awful! Speaking of awful. I want you to keep all the parents away from me this weekend. I can't stand their whining. One parent actually had the nerve to come up to me yesterday and complain about having to pay to watch her daughter dance. I told her no wad, no watch. How else am I supposed to pay for this $25,000 prize? It's certainly not gonna come out of my pocket. It's the observer bands and the water and the videos and the pictures. It's all about the Benjamins and the Lincolns and the Franklins. And here I thought it was about the dancing and the kids learning and being inspired. What a sweet boy you are. There's a tree in the parking lot. Go hug it. - (laughs mockingly) - You see, that statement is exactly why you work for me, and not the other way around. Because if you ran this show, we'd be sunk before Christmas. All right, I want you to test out this floor, make sure it's not too slippery. I'd hate for one of their precious little angels - to take a fall and... - Get hurt? No, I'd get sued. Go. It is kind of slippery. You've been dancing since you were five. You still don't have that pirouette. Hey. I came in second in your nationals. That's right. You lost. We just got twenty boxes of sweatpants in. I want them unpacked and ironed. Sweatpants don't wrinkle. Yes, fine! Whatever. Just unpack them. Put them into nice little piles like they do at the Gap. (classical music, no audio) (exaggerated slow-motion wail) (slow-motion gasp) (slow-motion) You...can! (feral screams) (slow-motion) No! Competition starts in fifteen minutes. I need you to line up in the order of the first five dances, which are: Single Ladies, Let's Get Loud, Off With Their Heads, Party Rock, and is "Via De La Rosa" here? Great! Let's head backstage. (no audio) Perfect. Oh, my God. Mmm, this is so good. - Are you gonna finish that? - (judge) What a pig! Mmm. Ugh! Let's see some dance! Right? Sweetie! Aw! - She's safe. - Thank you so much. (JoAnn's friend) There's no seats left! (JoAnn) Don't be ridiculous. Here, here. Come on. Those are for the studio owners. Given the amount we pay each month, I'd say we're part owners. - (Friend laughing) Oh, my God! - Sit, sit down. - Okay. - Is your phone off? - Yes, yes, it is. - Okay. Are you going somewhere after this? No. just trying to look my best, unlike the rest of this stretchpants crowd. - Aren't you cold? - No. These ballrooms are like Antarctica. (laughs) - Just...stop. - (continues laughing) Don't worry about me. Besides, you know I only watch the numbers Jas is in. Oh, yeah. I forgot about that. Yeah. - Oh! - What? What? - Chip. - Aw! It won't look so good when people bend to kiss my ring. (JoAnn's friend laughs) Who do you think you are? The pope? (laughing hysterically) Oh, my God, what are you thinking? There's no way I can get through this sober. Yeah, well, we've seen your kid dance, we should be the ones drinking. I'll take those. Thank you! - You are bad. You're so bad. - Sit. - I know. Cheers. - Cheers! Ooh, look! - They're about to begin! - (applause) (cheering) Welcome to the first annual-- My mother, everybody, Mary Buttle, the owner of this fabulous convention! Thank you so much for that wonderful applause. You'd think I was a star. But I'm not. You all are. In fact, how many stars of tomorrow are sitting in these seats right now, I wonder. Huh? (chuckles) I just want to say how proud I am that I am able to provide all of you a warm, safe environment for you all to do your best! And let's begin! Our first number up... is JT to tell us who is our first number up! (microphone feedback) (crowd screaming) Mary Buttle! - Good luck. - You too. Nice costume! Ross, Dress for Less? Nice boobs...Wonder Bra? Let's go. We have to line up. (both grunt) (mocking) We have to go, we have to line up. Seriously, I can't stand her. If they win, I'm gonna puke. Thanks for sticking up for me. I didn't do it for you. (JT) The judges are taking a quick break but are about to take their seats. - What a jerk! - Mmm! And we can continue! Senior open small group number 108, Shine On! These kids are incredible. If I didn't know any better, I'd swear some of them are ringers. ( Mr. Ray) God, they're amazing! Oh.

Probably. Well, here there's only one winner. It was a clean routine, no mistakes. They'll bring it. No worries. All right! Diamond Dance, what a way to kick it up a notch! Okay, now for a small group, number 109: Battle for the Beat! (applause) - (music begins playing) - (crowd cheering) (tap shoes tapping) - (music ends) - (crowd cheering) They danced their hearts out. Hopefully it was enough! (applause continues) They're huddling, they're huddling! (choking sound) That was so great! (all cheering) (Brandon) So, I just got here, um... Hey! I know. About you, her. Duet partners? Yeah, I heard you talking in the studio. What, you weren't going to say anything to me? I don't mean anything to you? Of course you do. We're friends. - Friends? - Yeah. I mean, how could you even think about her? She is the competition! You should want to bury her, not stick your tongue down her throat! - I'm sorry you feel that way. - Really? I am. And if I hurt you at all, I'm sorry about that too. I really, really like Jas. And honestly, I would like nothing more than for my friend to understand that. Okay. ♪ Oh no no ♪ ♪ No no ♪ ♪ No no ♪ ♪ Oh no no ♪ ♪ After everything that we've been through ♪ ♪ How could you, how could you ♪ - ♪ Now remember... ♪ - (door slides open) God! I've been looking everywhere for you! Come on. They're about to announce the awards. So? Are you okay? (Mary) Not simply for dessert, but also for information. And one of the pudgy little... germ-ridden creatures is going to go home with a trophy. - It's as simple as that. - They will eat me alive if I go out there, but I'll do it. Fine, we can call that dinner. Mmm dinner. And dessert. God, I love this show. All you do is eat. You've actually had pizzas delivered to the competition. I have a tape worm. Do-- - Really? - It's big. (both laugh) - Oh, there's a God. - Oh, God. I think I just peed myself a little! I was going to announce the winners now... Yeah, I did, I did. I peed! (laughs) - Don't wave. - So proud. - Please don't wave. - So proud. - (drumroll) - But I have been instructed to inform you that we're going to announce the winners at our gala. Tomorrow evening. (sparse applause, crowd groans) Uh, tickets for the gala are still available. - $85. - (crowd boos) At the door. And please make sure you eat first. Because we're only serving dessert. 'Cause dessert's the cheapest thing on the menu. (booing continues) Hey babe, what do you got against dessert? You better watch yourself, young man. You almost made me look bad. No, Mary. You do that all by yourself. Come on, babe. You've got to go get ready for the faculty show. (classical music, no audio) Are you going to finish that? Welcome, dancers, to the closing night gala! Oh! We have had a great three days here! - Now, who wants to know the winners? - (Mary) I cannot wait for this night to be over! If I have to look at one more kid who can't dance or listen to one more parent who thinks their kid is Travis Wall, - I'm gonna rip my hair out! - (crowd boos) One parent even had the nerve to come up and yell at me because her kid wasn't called out. I need to put in a new rule: if you rode in here on a broom, your kid cannot compete. Why are they yelling? What has my idiot son said now? (JT) If you'll excuse me for a moment. (loud whisper) Play some music! ( Mary) Trust me, you simply have no idea how... - ...difficult it is... - Mother! Excuse me. I told you never to call me that. You can call me God, or Lord, or master, or... Enough is enough! This time instead of me embarrassing you, you've embarrassed yourself. What are you talking about? Everybody heard you on the phone. - What? - Your mic is open. Everyone heard every word. You insulted a room full of people. Well, I was ...uh, well, I was kidding. - And everybody knows I was kidding because I'm a kidder. - (JT scoffs) And besides, no one was supposed to hear that, see? And that's your fault. That's not my fault. Or it's bald Bob, the audio guy! It's always someone else's fault. Always! You think you could blame someone else, and it doesn't count. And his name is Jim! But it is your fault. You are the owner. You speak without thinking. And you hurt people. Okay, well, I can--I can fix this. I can fix this! No, not this time. (Mr. Ray) Wait. Hey, hey, no. Wait, wait, wait. Listen. I know what she said was terrible. I-- But she's not all bad. How can you say that after what we just heard? She has a good side to her, okay? I've seen it. It may be small, but it's there. Prove it! All right, listen. My studio was so broke, we couldn't even afford bus fare here, okay? Mary found this out. She sent us a check to cover the costs. I don't know what he's talking about. - I sent the check. - You what? You sent my money to them without asking me? Do you know what you've done? I could have you arrested for stealing! (crowd boos) Get this mic off. Somebody help me get the-- Look, have you seen those kids out there? It's not a business to them. Do you want to be in business come Christmas? Yes. Then I'm taking over. From now on... I'm running Circlestar. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some awards to hand out. (applause) Well, I am proud of you. Thanks. I knew you could do it. I know you can do it. Go. (chuckles) (JT) Now, on to the specialty awards. Most improved in classes goes to... - London from Diamond Dance! - (gasps, screams) (JT laughs) Well done! Well, take a bow! Very good. Now, the award that everybody has been waiting for. The top scoring dance of the night. In second place... It seems that... there are no winners. We have a tie! Diamond Dance and Shockwave Studios have tied! Now, there's no precedent, for this being the first National Nationals. So, after conferring with our judges, we decided there will be a dance-off. (applause) One student from each of the top scoring studios will dance for the win. (Jasmine) Why did they pick me? They should've picked you. I certainly think so. Stop it. They picked you because you're the best. And you can do it. Now get dressed. We're running out of time. Hey. Want me to help you stretch? Sure. So, uh, what song are you gonna use? I don't know. What style are you gonna use? I don't know yet. You're not gonna throw the competition, are you? 'Cause if you do, you'll be letting everyone down. That's so insulting, I'm not even gonna answer. You are, aren't you? - Gonna throw the competition! - No, of course not! This has nothing to do with her. I'm just scared. Of what? Of losing? Or beating him? Either? Both? I don't know. You look great. Now, let's do your hair. - You sound just like my mother. - (Simone) Good. Just double checking. I know we can count on you. Oh, I gotta go. Well, good luck! This studio really needs you, you know. You can go. Let's just put that hideous mistake behind us. Focus on how we're gonna win. - We? - Yeah. Point your toes. Head up. Stomach in. Extend your hands, you know? Don't give that boy another thought. He's no competition. You shouldn't even be allowed on the same stage. Will you be quiet, please? I love you. But sometimes I just don't like you very much. Well, clearly your judgement's off. And Brandon? I want to be more than his friend. Still friends? - I guess. - You guess. Go kill it. - Right. Yeah. - You got it. So? Diamond Dance won the coin toss. Jasmine, you'll dance first. And then Brandon. You guys have any questions? - No. - No. - May the best dancer win. - (Brandon) Okay, thanks. Hey, Jas? Jas, will you look at me? - Let's go kill it out there. - You too. Hey. For luck. (JT) Dancing first at our National Nationals is Jasmine from Diamond Dance!

(music resumes) - (music ends) - (applause, cheers) (Simone) Go Brandon! Yeah, Brandon! So good! Whoo! That looks like it's going to be a close one! Now let's give it up one more time for these amazing dancers! (crowd cheering) Now let's see how our judges are doing, making what is sure to be a tough decision. Randy? This was a close battle, folks. Can I have both dancers up here? Centre stage, please. By a margin less than two tenths of a point... The winner of this year's National Nationals... which along with the title comes a check for $25,000... goes to... (drumroll) Shockwave Studios! (cheering, applause) Yeah! (girl whispering) So insane! (Sarah) All right, ladies, ladies, ladies. We only have a few weeks until the next competition. I need focus, focus, focus! (Brandon narrating) For Sarah, it is already on to the next competition. I want you to sleep. I want you to eat food that fuels your bodies... London finally has her own fan club. (phones ringing) And JT lets Mary stick around. She even answers her own phone. (phone continues ringing) (exasperated sigh) Simone and Hope discovered you can be friends with the enemy. (sneezes) The check and the win saved Mr. Ray's studio. So, Shockwave sticks around.
