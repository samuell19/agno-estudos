But it's not to light my way in the dark. It's a mirror. And also a dagger. From my conscience it slices through reality. My footsteps are like a face smashing against a mirror. Time gets hotter by the minute. What is recorded forever is whatever is in the frame of this four-sided device. All risks to public health must be kept out of Beijing creating a safety cordon around the city. All residents along the White River must follow virus prevention and control measures. Crossing to Beijing over the ice is strictly forbidden. Mr. Yuan! You're finally out of quarantine. - Let me give you a lift. - It's okay, thanks. Go ahead.

The difference between 2pm and 3pm is the former is the face of the sun. The latter is the sun itself. Its eyes squinted and it yawned. Meeting you at 2pm is more elegant. At 3pm, there's hesitation.

Crunch, slurp, crunch, slurp... Soft and juicy in one fell scoop, like a swordsman wielding a sword. But red meat is harder to handle. It needs to be pulled and hammered to tenderize it properly. The beating and rolling drags out time. And of course one carries on tossing away. Only the flame works hard. Red meat isn't idle and it feels no pain. If the idea of imprisonment is to gain freedom, then I can wait a little longer. When a rose blooms in your eyes the door will open automatically. Shoes off, please. Lying down I greet bodies that have been spoiled by fear. Every time at the end, as expected the trembling kills the dream. If roses do not pierce my eyes blind I won't agree to wake up to redeem that moment of expectation. Downshift. Upshift. We were going to rent a place first. And save up to buy a house. But my wife was hellbent... on buying. But with what money? With what money? We're up to our eyes in debt. How will I pay it back? Wait a sec. Did she care what I wanted? Did she ask if I wanted a kid? No! More! Give it to me! No! More! No! No! No! No! No! Can I have some water? Reeds are my benefactors. Their advantage lies in their height and density. They form a barrier between me and the river. All my gaze can see is the opposite bank. This makes me oblivious to the heartlessness of the river. I wonder if the reeds understand me? I wonder if the reeds understand me? They stand tall and protect me. The wind gives them a helping hand. The wind gets ever stronger until I retrace my footsteps along the path I made, and go back the way I came. Reeds are my benefactors. Their advantage lies in their height and density. But there are things they don't know. If my heart doesn't sink to the bottom of the river then what will become of sorrow? Maybe it'll go with the wind. There are always those along the road who fall head over heels in love Do not laugh at the things they do for love Unless you have felt the bitter cold of winter You won't know the fragrance and warmth spring What is this thing called love? It is a promise that accompanies us till death Of all the stories in this world None is sadder than the "Plum Blossom Odes." The first ode is enough to break hearts. The second ode stirs up deep thought. The third ode brings a windstorm.
