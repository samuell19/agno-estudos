Once I get my share of the money, I'll fly to the United States immediately to have a sex change surgery. I want to be with my idol Boy George forever. For me, I'll buy big houses, luxury cars, dogs and horses. And I'll marry a pretty wife and eat shark fin soup in restaurants every day. I want to open a farm. I bet you'll open a brothel. Why would I ? I want to buy a mountain and be the chief of brigands. I'll buy lots of goats and cows, and squeeze milk non-stop. Are you guys trying to tell the whole world? What's that thing ? That thing ? Oh, it's here. Hurry up. - Take it out now. - It's here. This is your braised duck. Here... Give it to me. Sorry... enjoy your meal. It's inside. Where is it ? It's here. It fell into the drain. Move aside ! I've slimmer hands. I'll do it. Found it ? - Hurry up. - I'll find it soon. Stop rushing me. Found it ? - I got it... - You found it ? This is not it. Try again. Five dollars, five dollars again. Two dollars. What are you guys doing here ? Sir, we dropped a coin. How annoying. I told you not to fool around. You dropped a coin but you found so many. Are these not enough ? Sir, the coin I dropped is a dollar, two dollars. It's not five dollars either. We won't take money that does not belong to us. Sir, we're good citizens. - Go now. - Yes, Sir. Stop eating ! You'll get it from me if you can't find the diamond. I'll look for it again once the police leaves. He's gone. Let's search for it now. The dog's biting his vital parts. How funny ! Help... - Think of a way to help him. - Sure. Help... it's gone. - Are you alright ? - How are you ? Another diamond ? How dare you pocket it yourself ? You're dead ! Stop ! Scum, stop right there ! You're dead... Someone's fighting. How dare you... Let's split up. - Boss, I can't find him. - Boss. We can't find him anywhere. What should we do now ? We must catch him. - Yes. - OK. You can carry on running. Stay there. Boss, I'm sorry. It's all my fault... Save me. If not, I'll fall down. What do you think will happen if you fall down ? My head will crack and my limbs will break. I'll be dead for sure. Let's see if you're right. Don't... What's that ? It's so noisy. He went into that house. - Let's wait for him downstairs. - OK. I know you're inside. Come out now. If not, I'll strike ! Japanese, that diamond does not suit you. Hand it over. Goodbye. Boss, are you all right ? - Go get the money back. - Yes. Stop ringing... It's still ringing... It's broken and yet, it still rings ? Why is this baseball bat beside my bed ? I'll wear this. Stop crawling ! I saw you. Turtles, I told you not to crawl out. Darn it ! I'll peel off your turtle shells. I'll leave you naked and let you freeze to death. Don't come out again. Be good and play in the toilet. Stay here. - What are you doing ? - I lost my contact lens. There he is ! Are you sure you saw him ? I did. - Then, where is he ? - It can't be. Watch out ! What's the hurry ? Why am I so unlucky ? Forget it. I'll take the stairs. Where's my car keys ? I remember putting it here. Watch where you're going ! Sorry. This is yours. Are you blind ? What an unlucky day. It stinks... Close your mouth and turn your face away from me. You just ate garlic ? Having an indigestion ? Your teeth must be rotten. Your mouth stinks ! Brushing's not going to help. You won't ever get a chance to develop an intimate relationship. Get a bottle of Orchid Mouthwash now. It's him... Show me your license. Sir, please give me a chance. Don't you understand Cantonese ? Show me your license. Yes, give him a fine. Sir, give him a fine. He deserves it. Here it is. Pighead Bing ! You called the police a pighead ? You're going to get it. You're insulting the Hong Kong police. Am I right, Sir ? My nickname is Pighead Bing. The lights has turned green. Get going ! Sorry, Sir. George Lee, how have you been ? I'll buy you tea some other day. Call me. He's speeding ? I've to perform my official duties. You're so manly. I'm sure you're also a gentleman, right ? Yes, I'm a gentleman. I'll let you have the parking lot, OK ? Thank you. Didn't you say you'll let me have this lot ? Are you deaf ? I said I won't... let you have the parking lot. If there's another free lot, I can give it another thought. So, you want us to go down together ? Hold it. You're the one going down, not me. I'm off. Enjoy your time here. Bye. Goodbye. Ah Yo. You think I'm stuck ? I can go in and out. Wretch ! Together. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... 1, 2, 3, 4... Good morning, Ah Yo. He's still smiling. He must be used to it. Too much laughter will cause wrinkles and your breasts will sag. And you'll have your menopause earlier. - You... - You're laughing ? Continue... continue laughing... - He's so mean... - You should retaliate... Despicable, obscene, scum, shameless, Ah Yo ! Ah Yo... My name's George, not Ah Yo. Remember ! Ignore him. Let's carry on with the practice. Ma'Q ! I'm here. There's smoke ! Luckily I took it out in time. Boss... how are you ? Are you all right ? Don't die. You've not paid me my salary. Are you trying to kill the boss and replace me as the director ? No, I was squatting there doing work - and didn't see you. - You didn't see me ? Look, my shirt is stained. I can't go out now. You didn't see me ? Stop. If not, I'll hit your acupoints. - Go on... - I'm really doing it. I'll hit... I hit his vital acupoints ? Oh no, I don't know how to undo it. Move... Oh no, how do I undo it ? My secret martial arts book... Let's see... one inch above the left rib. Which is left and which is right ? Whatever... It should be somewhere here. Undo... Why isn't he moving ? Maybe I'm not skilled enough ? Let me read this again. The fifth rib... that's correct. So, what's wrong ? I didn't hit your vital acupoints ? You really believe you can do it ? I'm just teasing you. I didn't expect you to be so playful. You must be enjoying yourself. Listen. What cases do we have today ? We haven't got any customer today. Shut up ! Listen ! I'm in a very bad mood today. I understand... There's a solution to everything. Let me get the stains off your top first. Put this down. Why do you always doubt my new products ? If I don't, I'll be dead by now. Spray it and you're fired. Put it down and I'll consider giving you three months' year-end bonuses. Being happy is more important than money. I'll spray... Be happy... - Stop spraying... - This is so fun... Stop spraying. - This is so fun... - Don't... Let's take a look at the effect. Darn it. I told you not to do it. What's all this smoke ? I've no idea. Your top looks cleaned. I did it ! The instant cleaning spray I invented works. You're amazing. My efforts in training you has paid off. - Let's go register the patent now. - OK. Mom, you should feel proud and honored to have me as your son... Come on, let's go. Ma'Q... Go put on your clothes. - Ma'Q ! - He's gone. He's not here. Rascal ! You're not here ? Go look for your mom now. - Mom ! - Your mom is your mother. Where's your mother ? Go look for her now. - The phone... - Ask your mom to answer the call ! Hello, is that George ? He said he won't answer the call. Can I ask my mom to take your call instead ? Give it to me. Hello, I'm George. I'm Inspector Hua. Stop fooling around. Inspector Hua, what can I do for you ? I found a good job for you. You do ? Meet me at High Claims Insurance Company half an hour later. You still remember what you've to do ? Of course, business as usual. OK, be alert. See you later. OK, bye-bye. - Ma'Q, my battle suit ! - Here it is. "HIGH CLAIMS INSURANCE COMPANY" Inspector Hua, he's good. - He's great. - Shut up ! This guy seems to be quite skilled. Of course, he's at his peak. - His punch is strong - Strong... - and his kick is forceful. - Forceful... And he's smart too. He'll handle the case well. Good. Let's watch the show... Where did he go ? - Is he quitting ? - No way. Enough fighting. Time-out... Let me take a break. Cut it out. Come out now or we'll be exposed. I'm so tired. Do you have water ? You can drink water only after we knock off. Come on. Fine. There he is. We can continue with the show now. Good. He's really good. Friend, be gentle. This is made of iron. I'm running out of breath. Back off. Hit me. Give me a punch. Lower your head. Kick me. Block and lower your head. Block and lower your head. Why do they keep repeating the moves ? Manager Zhou, is your CCTV spoilt ? - Your CCTV must be spoilt. - It can't be. I see... he must be testing them out. - Testing them out ? - This is a smart move. Smart ? A good show is coming up next. - Change your moves. We'll be exposed. - We've run out of moves. Show the expression of your groin being hit. We're lowly paid. Be gentle. - We're better off being martial artists. - Right... Get ready to run away. He defeated four persons. He's really good. Amazing... he's good. The test shows that he's good in martial arts and is agile. Manager Zhou, are you satisfied ? Hi... good evening, everybody. Let me do the introduction. This is Detective George. - This is Manager Zhou and this is Mr. Cao. - Yes. This is Mrs. Cao. Mrs. Cao. Come here... Cut the crap. I know you've received the Queen's secret order. You've to go to the airport in an hour to save James, right ? Right, I've to save Bond. He's taken to the space fortress by E.T. He'll be dead if I don't save him. As usual, I'll get 60% of the fees and you'll get 40%. That's too little. Bond only gets 30%. You're already getting more than him. That means I'm better than James Bond. - He's as good as James Bond. - Keep your mouth shut ! - You know of this case, right ? - Yes, I do. - You've to find back Lucky Star. - Got it. Detective George, how long do you need to retrieve Lucky Star ? Right... this is what I want to ask too. Time is not an issue. I'll go gather information right away. Bye. So, when is that ? Don't worry. It means it's not an issue at all. Even if there's any issue, it's just a time issue. How is it ? I can't find the informant anywhere. The informant has lied to me. Boss, what's next ? Take a breather and go check out again. OK. Why aren't you moving ? You told me to take a breather. I told you not to receive salary this month ! OK, no problem. Boss, this won't do. - I really can't find the informant. - I don't believe it. Then, try finding him yourself. Are you stupid ? Where are you going then ? I'm going home. Home ? Good idea. Sending message by pigeon ? Take three steps backwards, turn right and go straight. - One... - One... - Two... - Two... - Three. - Three. Walk straight. - But we're walking right into a wall. - A wall ? Turn right and go straight. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... Turn right again. Enter when you see Zhishan Hall. From the informant. Zhishan Hall ? - It's here. - It's here. This is where you said you'll dock my pay. Shut up and go in. Hey, Informant. Female Killer ! Why does she look like a mountain ? So, Female Killer has resorted to becoming an informant. Enough of your nonsense. You want clues about the diamond robbers, right ? Come up. She's good. Relax. Lucky for you. You don't have to queue today. Follow me. Queuing is a norm here ? The files of all the bad guys are here. Look for it yourself. These are the bad guys from the black-and-white movies' era. Aren't you being too nostalgic ? What I want is information on the thieves involved in the diamond robbery case that took place in mid-May 1985. Those were free entertainment for you. You're looking for the diamond thieves, right ? It's all here. That many ? Oh no, this will take us a long time. You don't have to search. I've got what you want inside this file. Really ? The diamond robbery case in mid-May 1985 is done by them. You can have this. The lift is always so slow. Who's that ? The face cream... Please give me back my face cream. The face cream... Let me go. I'll give you the face cream. I'll give you everything. He's dead... You gave me a shock. He didn't die of shock. He was ambushed and stabbed to death. Come with me. I'm ambushed dozens of times a year - but I'm still surviving. - No. A dead man's lying at my door. - Come quickly... - What ? So serious ? - Over there. - Where is it ? Turn to your right. - There's really a corpse ? - Yes, it's there. You're lying again. I don't even see a dead ant there. There's nothing there ? Nothing. Go see for yourself. It's very clean there. Go on. Mom ! - There's really nothing there. - Of course. The corpse may have resurrected ? Are you stupid ? Stop bothering me. She's crazy. It can't be. Where did he go ? Wretch, where's the diamond ? Why don't you check the yellow pages ? Rascal ! Who are you looking for ? You. Who's looking for me ? Killer. Killer ? Why would a killer look for me ? To kill you. To kill me ? One slap from me and you'll be in coma for three days. Ma'Q, stop fooling around and hang up. I'm not Ma'Q. Hand over that thing or you'll be like that corpse. You... you're really a killer ? Hang up or I'll call the police. Hello, Police ? A phone call wants to kill me. No... someone called to say he'll kill me. How does he look like ? I've no idea. Then, do you recognize his voice ? Yes. - How does he sound like ? - He sounds like you. I haven't hung up yet. How do you call the police ? - What do you want ? - I won't kill you. I dare you. Why not ? It's just not my turn yet. What ? I've two buddies who're a step ahead of me. Why can't I find it ? Ma'Q gave me lots of stuff for self-protection. Where are those stuff ? One Drop Super Glue. Ma'Q, your super glue must work. Wretch, you can't run away. Let go. Help ! Bring her back. - How dare you fight back ? - Let go ! - I can't move my legs. - Same here. Ma'Q, thanks for saving my life. - The glue is too strong. - How are you ? What about you ? She's running away. - She's gone. - Help me lift my legs. - Yes. - Yes. Harder. - Help me. - Come. - Don't forget me. - Give me a hand. Give me a hand. Hurry up. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. "MISS ANITA MUI" Why is Anita Mui not here yet ? Miss, do you know how to add ? What is one plus one ? It's too difficult. Do you need an abacus ? - Miss Mui, you're half an hour late. - I'm not... - Come on. You need to change now. - No... - Get ready for the performance. - Yes, Manager. Show time. That fat customer in red top, please go back to your seat. Don't block the views of others. Ladies and gentleman, we're very honored to have superstar Miss Anita Mui on stage tonight. A round of applause, please. Miss Anita Mui ! - I can't sing... - The audience are waiting. Go on. Miss Mui... "A little bird fell into the water..." "It was flushed down..." Why did she sing such kind of songs ? Return us our money... - It's that wretch. - I'll go get her. Return us our money... Sing some pop songs... Miss Mui, don't fool around. - Please sing... - Again ? Yes, please sing... Music... "The falling flowers cover the moonlight..." Return us our money... Everyone... Miss Mui was just joking with you. - We're done with jokes, right ? - I'm not joking. She said no more jokes. Music... Miss Mui, stop fooling around. I can't stand it anymore. I know this song. "Music is on" "I'm drawn to it" "I can't help but sing along" "Not caring how I sound, I sing even louder" "I don't care if I embarrass myself I just want to be happy" "So be it if I sing wrongly Take it as a new song" "I don't care if it's out of tune" "The audience clap warmly" "I continue singing on stage" "So be it if I sing wrongly, I won't back off" "So be it if I sing wrongly Treat it as new tempo" "Doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong" "Be happy and sing along with me" "So be it if I sing wrongly Take it as a new song" "I don't care if it's out of tune" "The audience clap warmly" "I continue singing on stage" "So be it if I sing wrongly, I won't back off" "So be it if I sing wrongly Treat it as new tempo" "Doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong" "Be happy" - "And sing along with me" - Fantastic... I didn't expect Anita Mui to perform so well. - Amazing... - Who's that on stage ? Why ask the obvious ? Of course it's Anita Mui. Then, who am I ? Miss Mui ! Why does the person on stage look so similar to you ? You can continue using her tomorrow. Miss Mui, let me explain. It's just a misunderstanding. "Sing along with me" "Music is on" "Don't be shy and sing along with me" Please give me another chance. Miss Mui ! She's there. I'm in pain... Wretch ! You'll be dead if I catch you. Let's go. Good morning, Ah Zhi. Good morning, ladies. - Morning. - Our boss lost today ? How did this happen ? What's so surprising ? I gave in to her previously. - What about today ? - Today ? She lost. She's totally defeated. What's so great about winning a parking lot ? Ignore them. Let's continue with our practice. Boss, you must be feeling happy. You got your revenge. Of course, she's asking for trouble by competing with me. Right. It's her again. The two of you are truly a match made in heaven. I'll leave you both alone. I don't want to stand in your way. Light the fire. Fire ! Someone's dying ! Fire... Help. Step aside... Help, there's a fire ! Look how pathetic she is ! Game over. You're exaggerating. I sat there the whole of last night. A few weirdos tried to kill me. Come on. You were having nightmare, right ? Did you give yourself two slaps ? Did you try biting your own fingers ? You didn't ? Did you try punching yourself ? You're lying. No, I'm not. Someone tried to kill me when I went home yesterday. I was all right but he died. You're insulting my boss' exceptional intelligence. I'm not lying. Those three guys chased me from my home all the way to Pak Po Street, - Yim Po Fong Street, Hak Po Street, - Pak Po, Yim Po Fong, Hak Po, - Argyle Street, Sai Yeung Choi Street, - Argyle, Sai Yeung Choi, - Soy Street, Changsha Street and - Soy Street... Portland Street. I was so tired. They ran after you for nine streets. This sounds too ridiculous. You think I'm dreaming ? Trust me. I'm telling the truth. Doesn't matter if it's true or not. Safety comes first. I'll gift you this anti-wolf alarm device. You don't have to worry if you meet those guys again. Here, for you. I pray you'll meet those guys again soon. Don't curse me ! Fine, I'll pray that I make a killing in tonight's horse racing then. - Any news ? - Number 2 and 5 for Race 3. Mr. Cao, take a seat... Go away. - Get back to work ! - What ? Mr. Cao, I've clues for your case. It took me five minutes to find this information. Check this out. Take your time. Try identifying them. Why aren't they wearing helmets ? How can you identify them if they wear helmets ? How can I identify them if they're not wearing helmets ? They were all wearing helmets when they rob my diamond. I see. Don't worry, Mr. Cao. I'll find more information for you. Rest assured I'll get them. - It's them ! - Be quiet. - Mr. Cao, if not for me... - I recognize them. How can you when the person directly involved can't ? They're the ones who chased me and tried to kill me. Hinder me again and I'll kill you ! - It's true. - Shut up ! Even if you kill me, I can recognize them. I wonder if the insurance company had engaged the wrong person. Listen. Don't look for me if you've got no updates. Mr. Cao... Believe me. It's them. I'll slap you ! Fine, I believe you. Now, please pack your stuff and go. Please... Please go. Get out of my sight. - Ridiculous. - Why did you come out from there ? They must have an affair. So, you guys patched up... - Don't be deceived by him... - That's right... - Me ? - Me ? - Him ? - Her ? Nothing's going on between us. Now, carry on with your practice... OK, we'll go practice now... Can't you believe me for once ? They're really out to kill me. I know. They asked you for face cream but you refused. So, they tried to kill you, right ? Why won't you believe me ? Believe you ? I'm not a fool. You're so annoying. Trying to fool me ? Dream on. She just wants me to follow her everywhere and be near me. She must be interested in me. Boss... If she's not lying, wouldn't she be in grave danger ? Won't she be raped and killed ? I... Why are you blocking my way ? I'll send you home. - Me ? - I embarrassed myself again. You... - You like being clamped by the door ? - No. Let's get going then. I just recalled my car's outside. Again ? Those three guys are scary. And they seem to be everywhere. You make them sound like God ? Trust me. You've to watch out when you're with me too. It's their luck if they bumped into me. I'll beat them until they beg God for mercy. Come out ! Ah Zhi... Help... Get in ! Ah Zhi... Ma'Q. - Yes ? - She was taken away. - Who ? - Who else ? Of course, it's her. I'm facing you now. So, I'm "me" and you're "you". All other people are "him her". There are more than five million people in Hong Kong. How would I know who she is if you don't speak clearly ? Ah Zhi was taken away. What ? Where to ? How would I know ? If I do, I wouldn't be asking you. But I don't know either. That's why I came to you for a solution. You're a detective. I'm just your assistant. You should be the one thinking of solutions. You... You look so concerned. I just want to test if you like Ah Zhi. Didn't I give her an anti-wolf alarm device earlier ? What's the use of an anti-wolf alarm device ? There's a tracker attached to it. Now, look. - Hurry up. - I've to turn it on first. Where is she now ? We've to go save her. Before that, we've to get ready our weapons and locate her position. Help... let me out ! Fatty, let me out ! Wretch, another word from you and I'll pinch your right side. Left side. Your lung ! Come in if you dare. You'll be dead if I go in. Once I'm in, I'll kick you, punch you, beat you and hammer you. Come on. Come in and I'll hit you with this. I won't fall for your tricks. I'm just teasing you. I'll go back to reading the pictorial. I can't be bothered with you. Pinch... Stop ringing ! Don't come near me ! Wretch, you're using a hidden weapon ? What did you see ? I see nothing. Go to hell ! Where could that diamond be ? We couldn't find it anywhere. That wretch has escaped ! Let's see where else you can run to. Watch out. Go to hell. That was high. Go straight... turn... go straight... Left... right... - Go straight... - Go, go, go... You can't even watch a girl ? Instead of watching the girl, you got watched from head to toe. Cover yourself. Stop. The thing's not moving now. - Boss, what do we do next ? - It must be here. - Let's go in then. - Let's go. What a close shave. - Boss, how did you come over ? - I walked over. Stupid ! I'll go first. No one's here. Come in. - Ah Zhi's belongings are there. - Really ? It's the anti-wolf alarm device. - Where is Ah Zhi ? - How would I know ? Go search for her ! Me again ? Are you going or not ? Fine. I was eating peanuts, drinking beer and browsing the pictorial when it started ringing inside. - What was ringing ? - That girl. How could that girl be ringing ? That girl's... that thing rings. So, that thing on that girl rings ? No wonder you're naked. So, does she taste good ? Not bad. She even stretched out her leg. We were just chitchatting. Can't we even chitchat ? It's gone... What have you lost ? And what have you lost ? Nothing. Same here. What about you ? I'm fine. So, everything's fine. Everything's fine ? We didn't recover the diamond and the girl ran away. How can we answer to Boss ? Go get that girl back ! OK. They're all gone. I know. Who is their boss ? Their boss... I know ! Who is it ? It's not me. Why did she leave the anti-wolf alarm device behind ? She's not at home. Where can she be ? She slept here again ? What's up ? He has gone mad. I should have known better. So stupid of me. Boss, I think this case is very complicated. All the people, except for us, are suspects. You're really annoying. I'm very upset now ! You're even more annoying. He's vulnerable. I'd better keep an eye on him. Ah Zhi ! He's going crazy. I must be dreaming. Ah Zhi. Are you OK ? I was looking for you everywhere. We'll definitely save you. We're just late. Why didn't you wait for me ? The most precious thing for a woman is that thing. How can you be so stupid as to use that thing to escape ? They locked me in the room. Those beasts kept searching... Which parts of your body did they search ? He searched my pockets. And then, he forced his way in. So, I seduced him. I thought I'll just suffer a little. I didn't expect him to press down so forcibly. Even the table was crushed. I'm fainting. What happened then ? I sprayed something at him. That bad guy has a reaction. So, I ran. But he... he stripped and ran after me. I pushed him away. And then, two other guys came along. Another two ? They chased me all the way from the garden to the roof. The roof almost collapse. And then, I fell onto a bed and became unconscious. I'm unconscious too. Boss... Do you need to see a doctor ? Doctor ? - Go away. - Do you need to see a doctor ? No, I just have some scratches. What do you want ? For learning dance, it's there. For detective, it's there. Get lost ! That wretch is there ! You've not told me which side you want. You... You again ? These are the guys who were after me. Don't be afraid. I'm here. Let's see where else you can run to. Don't worry. I'm here. Here they come ! Step aside. Don't worry. There you go ! Relax. Where's that diamond ? Help... I'll kill you. - Throw... - Stop ! Run. Kill him... - Isn't he fantastic ? - Yes, he is. Stay there. Go to hell. Go to hell... Save me, George ! Hold on. I'm on my way. - Are you all right ? - Watch out ! Go to hell. Don't look at me. I'm not the protagonist. Diamond ? I have the diamond. - Where is the diamond ? - It's not with me. Where is it ? I found the diamond ! It's with me now. Let's go. Run... - They're gone. After them. - After them. - Here. - Here. Over there. Run. Hurry up. "NO PARKING" Stay there. Detective, why are you in such a mess ? Drive. Come on ! What place is this ? Why did he bring us here ? You should drive us to the insurance company. Right. It's late. You should go in to take a rest. Your place is pretty. Thank you. Please take a seat. Are the people chasing after you the diamond robbers ? Yes, it's a big case. You're lucky you gave us the job. Had it been others, they would be lying on hospital beds now. Why didn't you catch them then ? I can handle them even if one of my arms is tied up. But I found out there's another mastermind. So, I'm throwing a long line to catch the big fish. - I see. You're so smart. - Of course. What a woodpecker. Woodpecker ? One who brags and catches worm (meaning, asking for trouble). - You're being sarcastic. - Am I not right ? - Repeat that if you dare. - Sure. - You're the woodpecker. You catch worms. - No, you're the woodpecker. You catch worms. If not for me, you would have died. - You're bragging. - You're bragging. Stop arguing and listen to me. I want to thank both of you for recovering my diamond. You've no idea how exhilarating this is. It evolved from a simple robbery case into one with internal strife, killing, chasing, kidnapping and imprisonment. We risked our lives to retrieve this diamond. You're so brave. - You're amazing. - Of course. It's all worth it. Come on. If not because you came in halfway, things wouldn't have been so complicated. I'd have solved the case much earlier. If not for me, you wouldn't have any clue. Bullshit ! - What ? - What ? Master, dinner's ready. How dare you claim the credit ? - I... - Stop arguing. Bad mood can affect appetite. Let's have dinner first. He enjoys quarreling with me. Please take a seat. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hello. I hope you like the dinner tonight. This is my wife. Mrs. Cao. - What a happy ending. - Right. Everyone got what they want. Detective George, can I have the diamond back to put it in the safe ? It's truly a happy ending. Let's drink to it. - Right. - Cheers. - The diamond... - The diamond... I'm the expert, you're not. So, it's safer to leave the diamond with me. I can't give it to you now. Not now. Sorry, I was too anxious. Fine. We'll visit the insurance company to complete the formalities tomorrow. You're so understanding. Let me give you a toast. Cheers. - Freeze ! - Calm down. Don't move. Go there. Hurry up. Detective, you've to protect us. Hand me the diamond, or I'll kill them. Detective, no violence please. Give them the diamond. Yes, give them the diamond. What now ? Don't be afraid. I'm here. Don't be afraid. Leave or I won't go easy on you. - Give me the diamond. - No, I won't. - Give it to me ! - No. Give it to me. Give it to me ! No, I won't. Detective, I don't want that diamond anymore. Give it to him. Give it to them, or we'll all be killed. Are you giving it to me or not ? No ! Hand it over or I'll kill you. I won't give it to you even if I've to die. Boss, he refused to give it to us. What should we do next ? Yes, I'm the mastermind. Stop ! You'd better hand the diamond to us. Boss, did I do it correctly ? Stupid ! If you didn't expose my identity, I'd have tricked him into handing over the diamond. Boss. Stop slapping me ! You may be the one paying but we can choose to quit. I don't want anything. Hand the diamond over or you'll end up like them. What say you ? Did I ask you to speak ? No, you didn't. I'm sorry. - Get lost ! - Yes. Wretch, you're so evil. You hired people to rob your diamond to scam money. And now you kill to silence them ? You're inhuman ! Although we're both women, we don't have a despicable kind like you. It's your turn now. You don't want to die, right ? Your threat doesn't work on us. We're not afraid of death. Right. - But it'll be good if we can live. - Right. I don't wish to do this but you know too much. If I can't get back my diamond, you'll have to die. Even if we give you the diamond, you'll still kill us. No, I won't. I keep to my words. Give me the diamond and I guarantee you'll be fine. How can you guarantee that ? My dignity. That's as good as none. I'll give you 30 minutes to consider. If you still refuse to hand over the diamond... The Bible says that we must say out our secrets before we die. Otherwise, we can't go to heaven. I always fight with you. You can speak first this time. Why should I speak first ? You first. You first. Forget it then. Let's all not do it then. No, I'll speak... Actually, I've long like... like... - to eat glutinous rice. - Glutinous rice ? It's delicious. Your turn now. Me ? I don't want to die. What else ? I want to go home. What else ? That's all. What about you ? I want to jump into the sea. Jump into the sea ? This world is so unfair. I only peeked at you once while you're changing and I'm about to die. Ma'Q peeked at you so often and he's out there enjoying life. You're so dirty-minded. Dirty-minded ? I just wanted to peek at the person I love. You call that dirty-minded ? Isn't Ma'Q more dirty-minded then ? Since I'm dying, I might as well admit. I admit... - You... - I admit... I'm tall and mighty, wise and powerful, handsome and romantic as well as selfish and egoistic. I've so many good points. Why won't you like me ? Why should I tell you that I like you ? How would I know if you don't tell me ? I don't like to tell you that I like you. You... So, you do like me. Yes, my wish's fulfilled. - Ah Zhi. - George. Enough of your lovey-dovey. - You're still alive ? - Yes. I'm here to save you. Can't you be sensitive for once ? For goodness sake, let me confess my feelings. Sure. Since everyone's here, I want to tell my secret too. So, what's your decision ? Although you look stubborn, I trust you're softhearted. Tiger. George... Ah Zhi... Let me go. - Leave her alone. - George ! - Ah Zhi... - George... If you've guts, let me go. We'll have a duel. Ah Zhi... I'll tell you where the diamond is. Where is it ? It's not with me. Tiger, she's all yours. Don't... Ah Zhi... You can have her back. Watch out ! Count me out. Come on. Smart guy. Ah Zhi... Step aside. Ah Zhi... Don't worry, Ah Zhi. We're fine now. George... Stop being lovey-dovey. We've to be on our way to the insurance company to claim our rewards. Be careful. Watch your steps. Darn you ! How dare you molest me ? - Ah Zhi. - Stay there. Bro, I'm just joking. - George, I can't hang on any longer. - Hang on. - Save me. - I'll be there soon. Relax. I'll get to you soon. - How are you ? - Go save Ah Zhi. OK... George... I can't hang on any longer. Save me. Step on my shoulders... Be careful. Ma'Q, don't move around. We'll fall. Stand still. I can't... I can't take it anymore... Are you OK, Ah Zhi ? What about you, Ma'Q ? Luckily we're still alive. We escaped death. I'm off. Rascal, don't you have any loyalty ? I'll dock your pay. Tell me where the diamond is or you'll become skewer beef. - Speak ! - Don't. I'll speak... it's with him. No, it's with her. No, it's with him... no, it's up there. Dear, the diamond is here. - Freeze. - Freeze. - Freeze. - You can't escape this time. Bring him down. Move... Don't move... - Dear... - Mrs. Cao, keep your calm. Put the bow down. We can talk this over. What ? Catch her... Dear... - Ma'Q... - Ma'Q... - Ma'Q, don't die. - Ma'Q... Ma'Q... I'm not dead yet. I've a wish. - Ma'Q... - Ma'Q... What did Ma'Q tell you ? Ma'Q asked me... No, he asked you to marry me. No, I'm not dead. Even if I die, I'll not say such words. Luckily, this star saved me. It's so painful... Look at the bruises. Can't you just do me a favor ? - What ? - You're so naughty. You... Inspector Hua, you're always like this. You only appear with your troops after we've settled everything. This is my style. It's been like this since the black-and-white movies' era. Otherwise, protagonists like you will have no parts to play. Rascal, throw the ice bucket over. Yes. Look, I'm still as good. The diamond is inside the ice bucket. Help find the diamond. - Hurry up. - Yes. Look for it... Return it to me when you find it. Hurry and look for it. Hurry up... - Where is it ? - I can't find it. Diamond... I found the diamond ! Lucky Diamond ! "THE END"
