I cut the tongue out of your mouth, for a fuckin' reason. 'Cause there ain't no pearls of motherfuckin' wisdom that you can possibly offer me at this juncture.

Nah-uh, I'm righteous. I am the right hand and wrath of God Almighty. I am vengeance! (laughing) A little food for thought in your next life, Cass. Good or bad, heaven and hell, they don't matter.

It's like that? - It's like that. - Oh, and you're just gonna sit here, and count the shit in front of me? - Uh huh. - I thought we was cool! I thought we was tight like Hanes Her Way on sumo wrestlers, like acid washed on rednecks, like little bitty elbows on fat folks. - Good.

(door slams) That's what I'm talking about. - Where's Carmen? - Oh, she's back there. - What is this place anyway? - The lab I do security at owns it. You know what I'm saying?

(tense music) (electric saw buzzing) (loud typing) (lighthearted music) - Just in time. - So, what is that anyways? - A letter of consideration for my promotion. - They don't just make you an offer like every other job? - Yeah. But only consideration after an official letter of consideration. So... Would you stop looking at me? - Why? - 'Cause it's distracting. It'll only be a sec, okay? - Sure. - Big James! What's good with you, man? - Bernard, what's up, man? - I'm hangin', man. You got it? - Bernard. - Cassie. (lighthearted music) Well, all right man, ya'll stay up, okay? (lighthearted music) - So, how much longer? - Soon. You can't rush perfection. - Sure you can. - Why are you so set on me coming with you? - No reason. - Mhm. (lighthearted music) - Sun's gonna be setting soon. It's getting late. Sorry.

(growling) Ah! Shit supposed to scare me? - I'm gonna eat your soul! - If by soul you mean my crotch, then yes, you would be correct. - Oh, mock me if you will, but the scales will tip in our favor, and we'll overrun the Earth! Her armies have gathered, and all it takes is just one of us to make it through. Everyone you know and love will burn. You can't save them. You're just worsening the inevitable. - Really? Worsening now? - You know, you should enjoy this world that you love. Because once she is activated, our reign of torment and suffering begins. Cassie is the key. - Cassie. Cassie who? - I'm through talking. (neck cracks) - Okay. All right. (knife cutting) (lighthearted music) - Now, James, what is it that you want to show me? (lighthearted music) I would think there would be a million people up here, just checking this out. - You'd think. Give it a little while longer, and you won't care anymore either. (laughing) - I hope not. Just sitting here makes me realize why I made this move. - Why did you move here? - The job. - Come on. You could've worked at a testicle implant lab in Miami. - Neurological fiber-optic implants, and no, I couldn't of worked in Miami. The only lab with an opening was here in Los Angeles. - Is that the only reason you moved here? What? - Why do you think I moved out here? No, come on, tell me. - I don't know. - You think I came out here for you? Is that what you think? - And you didn't? - No. - Then why did you pack up all your stuff, and move 3,000 miles across the country? - Are you high? Job placement from Emory University placed me in this position! In Los Angeles! - And you came to live with who? Me. - Because you offered. Until I found another apartment, which I placed a deposit on this afternoon. Yeah. I was looking for the perfect time to tell you. I guess this was a good a time as any. - Fucking bitch. - What did you call me? Did you call me a bitch? - No. - Yes, you did. - Cassie. Tell me you get it. What all this was for, tell me that at least. - You're a fucking jerk. You're engaged, you son of a bitch! To my best friend, who you left me for. Does she even know that I've been here, for the past couple of weeks? - Why? Do you think it would matter? I still have feelings for you. - You... (car door slams) (dramatic music) (sobbing) (engine revs) (sink running) (dramatic piano music) - Well, if that's the way it's gotta be... (groaning) (jarring music) - Ms. Newton. - Who are you? How are you in my apartment? - Shut up, bitch. He's coming for you, and so am I. - Who? (ominous music) - If he gets to you before me, I'm gonna have to do some very painful things to you. - Then what do I do? - Just... (rumbling) Shit. He knows I'm here. (screaming) - What's happened, James? - What? (calming string music) - Didn't you leave like three hours ago? - Aren't you glad I didn't? (calming string music) When did you have time to furnish it? - Huh? - The apartment. When did you have time to get some furniture for it? You just signed the lease today, right? - It came with the apartment. - Oh. - Why are you looking at me like that? - Like what? - Like I'm crazy. She was here, in my apartment, there was an earthquake or something that startled her, and then- - She disappeared. I heard you, the first 2 times you told me. But I gotta tell you, I didn't feel an earthquake, a tremble, or even a hard fart all night. - There was a woman in my apartment, with a gun, and she said if I let "him" find me before she does, she'd have to kill me. - Who is "he"? - I don't know. I don't want to find out. - Let's say this does make sense. I kinda sense that it shouldn't... Then what? Some guy is coming to kill you? - You dropped me off like 3 hours ago, why are you still here? (tense music) - You think it's me? That I'm the guy your imaginary friend is talking about? You know... Forget it. (tense music) Lying in my bed tonight, I realized something. That I've been pretending since I've left Miami. Pretending that I was a whole man, that I'm a happy man. But I'm not. Not with Kyla, not at all. There's a piece of me missing. And before you get all high and mighty, it's not you. It's the piece of me that makes me smile. Makes me happy to be anywhere that someone I care about is. The piece of me that I gave to you, freely. And now I wish I hadn't though. Because now I realize you weren't even worth the gesture.

She's the little firecracker I was telling you about that's gonna be taking your place when you get that big promotion. - So that's why you came here? They made their decision? - Well, not yet, but I have faith they do. Enough to already hire your replacement. - You mind if I talk to you outside for a second? - No, not at all. - Why? What goes through your head? - What are you talking about? - Hiring that- - Hey, hey, hey! She's not a that, she's your replacement. - What happens when I don't get the promotion? - What? You've got the promotion, it's in the bag. - [Cassie] Keith, you don't have to hire every woman you want to fuck. - I hired you. Anyway, I gotta make a run, I need you to do me a solid. Keep Vanisha here. I'm sure where the lab is being- - Keith. I am not babysitting some slut you're trying- - Not asking you to. Just keep her here for a few. Talk to her or something, she likes candy. - Keith! I'm not... See ya! - Keith, Keith! Damn it! (knocking) - Hey, what's happening, captain? (lighthearted music) - It's not polite to stare. - I'm sorry. It's just... He really does believe in you. He knows you're gonna get that promotion. - No. He knows he's gonna fuck you, that is what he believes in. - Did I do or say something? - No. You're fine, my dear. It's me. - No, don't leave. - I'm not leaving, this is my apartment. I'm taking a shower. - He says you're perfect. Says that you can teach me everything I need to know, but if I want to be perfect, I should copy your every move. Is that true? Is it? (mysterious music) - Hello? (jarring music) - Shit! - Oh my God! I am so sorry. Are you okay? - Um, it's okay. It's just okay. - Scared you good, didn't I? - [Keith] Um, yeah. - Karen. - Keith. - Do you live in the building? - No, just visiting. - Oh.

You haven't even spoken to me in almost a week. - I'm not the man I used to be. - Well... Do you still love me? Do you? - Yeah. - Okay. Well, come on home. Forget about her. - Her? - Don't be stupid with me, James. I know Cassie's back in town. Nina saw you there at the mall the other day. But I can't really say that much though, I mean, I did steal you from her. Listen. Come on home, baby. I've got so many things I want to do to you. (chuckling) - I love you. - Mm. I love you too. Get your ass home! (chuckling) - All right. - Okay, bye. Not like she can compete anyway with you, sexy bitch! (chuckling) (phone ringing) Ah. Back for more. Yes? - So, what now? - Shut the fuck up. - You're the lady from my apartment. You came to me last night. - Shut up! Get out the car. - Where are we going? Okay. All right. - Over here, come on. Stay here. Don't move, no matter what. Have a seat. - No, I'm okay. - Sit down! You're making me nervous. Come on, come on. - Okay. So, is this your apartment? - Nah, just some guy I had to kill. Don't worry, he was... He got to him before I did, we'll just say that. - Who's he? - [Woman] Come on, you know. - No. I don't. - The Big Bad, the Naughty Naughty, the snake that shoved the apple into Eve's kisser. - The devil. You said he was after me? - Yeah. See, for the past 2,000 years, he's been trying to climb out of the hell hole he's in to walk amongst God's children, to devour them. - You're saying there's a devil, and he's trying to get out of hell. - Yeah. - Just checking. - See, he was banished to hell, his physical, corporeal form destroyed. So now he's in the business of possession, jumping from body to body. - Why? - Collecting. Jars of hearts and blood. They're the life force you people, so regularly refer to. Now, I believe that once enough life force has been garnered, he's gonna use someone to channel it into a corporeal form for one of his Calcartic demons. And I believe that person is you. - Why? Why me? - I haven't figured that out yet. What do you do? - Neurological fiber-optic implant surgeries. Basically when there's a stroke victim or anyone with severe brain damage, their synapses lose their spark, they won't fire. So they send me in to re-wire the synapses artificially so that they fire again. - You play around inside people's heads? - In a manner of speaking, yes. - So if you wanted to, you could affect the way people think. - What, like mind control? Maybe? It's definitely not what I do. - But if were to put a gun to your head and make you do it, it would be possible? - I guess? - You want a beer or something? - No, thanks. - [Woman] You sure? You might want one after I tell you what I got to. - I'm okay. So, this guy you killed, how long had he been possessed? - Activated. - Activated. - Hell if I know. He wasn't even activated when I caught up with him. - Then why did you kill him? - Because once you're activated, even if you return back to normal, he's still there. Waiting. - For what? - But you are going to die. - What? How do you know that? - That's the way it always goes. The only question is will it be by him or me? - Why would you kill me? - The world is bigger than you and me, Lady Jasmine taught me. She passed me the torch so that I could do this. Save the world. Now this demon, this Calcartic, is the soul of someone who was tortured to death, and unfortunately, wasn't good enough to get into the Purgatory. But for the right price, just the right amount of mischief, the devil allows them safe passage back. - So, what, you kill me to keep one person from coming back? Who cares if one person comes back? - I do. But it's even more than swaying the scales of good and evil. And believe me, they are evil. They release the plague. Tons of bloodsucking and bloodletting. Bloody man's overture. They become vampires. - Vampires. - Yeah. So just that one person you speak of could cause unbelievable torment, will cause unbelievable torment. And I would kill you to prevent that. In a split second. Now, until we figure out how he plans on using you, you need to stay away from your cell phone and avoid radios and TVs. - Why? - Because that's how he activates you. Some stupid fuckin' song they sing. - Well, how does it go? So I'll be able to not hear it. - Don't know, I can't hear it. It's one of the perks of being one of the chosen ones. - Well- - I just heard it was a nursery rhyme or something. - What happens when he activates you? - You do whatever he tells you to do. Be it murder, torture, maim. It's always something nasty. - How did you find me? - The last fucker I took down mentioned your name. Said that when you were activated that was gonna be the be all, end all. - And you believed him? What if he was lying to you? - They don't need to lie to me. They are coming for you. And the only thing that's standing in their way is me and this pistol. Well, me, this pistol, and this whisky. - Comforting. - I'm not trying to be an asshole, but I need to get some sleep. - One more beer? - One more beer? All right. You know you my nigga, can't get no bigger. And if you did get bigger, you'd just be my bigger nigga. (chuckling) (knocking) I got it, I got it. Who is it? It's Kyla! - What? - How does she know you were here? - [James] I called her. - You called her? - Just open the door, it's okay. - Hi, Kyla. I just want you know...

He likes to let them feel as much blood and pain as possible. - It was quick. She shot herself in front of me. (sobbing) - Wow. So, what was the message he wanted delivered? - How did you know there was a message? - Oh, there's a message. Otherwise he would've taken his time to do it right. Pronto, shit. Come on! - Someone told her that... "She will become flesh." "Ramona won't stop it in time." - [Ramona] "She", huh? - Yeah. - And something about, "He's a big, bright, shining star." - Say what? - Big, bright, shining star. The entire time she was singing the "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" nursery rhyme. - That's it, right? You said there would be some kind of nursery rhyme that he'd be singing. - Were you followed? - No. - You sure? - Yeah. - You two, go into the bedroom. Don't talk on your cell phone, don't watch TV, don't listen to the radio. And wash that shit off your face. - Okay. Okay. Okay.

I am the Big Bad, the Naughty Naughty, I am in everyone. Even you. You feel it, don't you? Then why fight it? - Because I'm not evil. - I know, but indifference is in your heart. I'm not asking you to kill for me, just let me in, and I'll do it myself. - I can't. - Then suffering will be your reward. She is coming back, you know. And when she does, hell will follow.

(speaking in foreign language) Who are you? How did I get here? - Get in the bathroom. Shut the door and don't come out until I say so. - What was that? You shouldn't still have any power. You passed the torch. - I kept a little. (chuckling) - You know... - No, stay out. (chuckling) - This won't last for long. Your power will fade, and I will tear you apart! - Sure. (speaking in foreign language) - Fuckers, get out of the fuckin' way! (jarring music) - My turn! ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ (heart beating) - Jasmine? (coughing) You alive? - He took her. Are you happy now? I hope she was worth it. - She is. - He told me to tell you that this day ends where it began. - There's only been one thing in my life that I wish I could take back, and now I get that chance. - You can't stop him and have her too. The rules don't work like that. - You're right. So fuck the rules. All I want is my sister back, I don't want this anymore. - The world will end. - Maybe, maybe not. But all I want is my sister. The sun is up. We have until sundown. - You asking for my help? - A little bit more than that. I can't do this shit no more, and you want back in the game, so I'm passing the torch back to you. - I didn't train you to be a quitter. You fight to the end, 'til your dying breath. - Oh, I will. But only until I get my sister back, then I'm done. - Your plan? - His magic is stronger than ours, but he's in a human body. I figure we get him on the ropes long enough and- - And get him tired. - His strength will fade, then you come in and do what it is you do best. Kick the living shit out of him. (dramatic piano music) (groaning) (mysterious music) Who the fuck are you? (dramatic music) - Lady Black. - The Lady Black? - The fuck took ya'll so long? Back there in the back room. Back room. Yeah, the agency sent me down with a Calcartic demon in the loose. - Ramona's sister? - Ramona's sister. - What will they do to us? (chuckling) - That all depends on what I decide to tell them. (screaming) (dramatic music) - What have you done? What have you done? - What you two should've done. - She was my sister. - Yeah, I know. And she was dead. And she should've stayed dead. Now you can kind of think of her as re-dead. (laughing) - I should blow your teeth out the back of your fuckin' head! - Yeah, you could try. Look, you guys know the rules. You're lucky you're getting this. Cassie was dead, or Lucifer, or the devil, or whatever the fuck you want to call it. Dead. Here's the shotgun I used. I tell the agency you did 'em both, you walk. - And if I don't let you tell them nothin'? - Once there was this old, honest wise man, and he never told a lie, ever. He lived his life based on one truth, that his means would justify his end. That's until he met me. Then he realized his entire life was just one big lie. But you know, in our line of work, it's imperative that we remember that the journey is just as important as the destination. Sometimes more. In fact, just 'cause God gave us the privilege to do dirt does not mean it's cart blanche. So don't force me to show you how wrong you really are. - What does that mean? - It means take the offer and walk. - How do you know I won't shoot you? - Because I'll fucking kill you. Jasmine. - Thank you. (chuckling) - Oh stop, you're making me all teary eyed. - This was it. - I know. - I can't- - I know. - I'm gonna go down south. - Don't tell me where you're heading, I don't want to know. When the agency finds out you're AWOL I can't be connected. So run far and run fast. And watch your back. (gun cocks) (ominous music)
