[waves crashing] [cheerful music] [police siren blaring] [tires screeching] [loud crashing] - Chicken. [upbeat music] [police siren blaring] [upbeat music] - Who owns this car? Who's Johnny Varron? - Bitsy babe, you hear something? - Eh, I don't hear anything. - I'm sure I heard something. - Alright, let's have the IDs. [upbeat music] [giggling] Were you just driving south on Highway 32? - North. - Can you prove it? - North man, north. - Can you prove I didn't? - We just had an officer run off the road. You'll have to come with me. [upbeat music continues] - I'll see you in the morning, usual place. - Okay man. [all talking] Keep cool. - They can't hold Johnny. - Heck no. - Man what a swingin' stud. - Yeah. - We've located your father, he's on the way down. - Well I guess we know where he spends his nights, huh copper? - Hey. You'll leave when Sergeant Bronson tells you to leave. - Lovely place you got here. - Alright, knock it off. You know what this is? - We gonna play games? - [Sergeant] I asked you a question. - Okay, no I don't. - Then I'll tell ya. This is your record. - Did I make a record? - You see how it goes, Johnny. Speeding, reckless driving, and then the chicken scene, and finally you run a policeman off the road. - Wail along, man. - Alright that's enough. Officer Neeley is in the hospital more dead than alive. - Nasty break. - You think that's funny? - Doesn't matter whether I think it's funny or not. It hasn't got anything to do with me. - Johnny, we know you put him there. - You can't pin it on me. - No we can't. But you're through breaking the law. - Sarge, I don't break the law, I make my own. - Well that's not good enough. Your luck's running out buster. We're gonna stick with you, and we'll get you. - You Sarge? You're a big man. - We'll get you kid. Even if we didn't, you'd get yourself. Now beat it. - Sarge? Sarge I wanna tell you something. You're a very far out stud. So I said, Sarge you are a very far out stud. [laughing] - Sarge, you are a very far out stud. - The Sarge is so far out, he doesn't know who Johnny is. - How'd your old man take it? - I'm a chip off the old block. His boy can do no wrong. Like I'm just sowing my wild oats. - What was the scene last night, Johnny? - It was like rehearsing for the big race today. [laughs] - I don't need any rehearsal, man. - I guess he doesn't. - Joycey, who's gonna win us a big gold trophy today? - You are, big Johnny. - Hey this calls for a celebration. - Yeah! - Let's go down the beach and get gassed. - Great. Who's gonna buy? - Don't sweat man, I'll score. See ya later, huh? Hey Cliff, where's Dave? - He hasn't been by today. - Okay, I'll go find Dave, and make it one, huh? - Crazy. [car engine revving] [tires screeching] - What's the bit? - What do you mean what's the bit? - You're my chick, baby. - Oh wow Barny, he's got that old broad. - [Barny] Big man. [tires screeching] [serene music] - [Johnny] What's passing? - Nothing, just working on it. - Why the fall out? - Oh, I don't know. - You okay? - Yeah, sure. - You haven't been wheeling with us lately. Is something bugging you? - No, I'm okay, Johnny. - Wild scene last night. - Yeah. - Man my rod was really turned on. That cop was really sweating. - Was the cop hurt bad? - I don't know. - But why? - I like a race, man, he had room. - And why the tumble? - He chickened, that isn't my fault. What's happening with you anyhow? - Nothing. - You sound pretty far out, you've always been with me before. - I'm with you, Johnny. - I don't want anything to go wrong with my number one boy. You're in a blue man, you gotta turn this off. Listen uh, the gang's gonna make it to the beach today, why don't you and me split now we'll make it together, huh? - What about Anne? - She's out, she's old man, she's too much of a hang up. - When did this happen? - Like right now. Come on, let's cut huh? - Johnny. Well I can't, I told Nancy I'd call by later. - So that's what's bugging you. Is this thing really on? - Yeah Johnny. - After all I showed you with the chicks. Man when you pick one, you really pick one. You better watch out, you can catch cold around that broad. - She's not cold. - She's got her nose up in the air like she smells something she doesn't like. - No, she's not like that Johnny. - Already she's got you mixed. - Who's mixed? - Okay then what's this you're giving me? You're mixed alright. She won't fit. - She'll fit. - She turns everybody off, get yourself a new chick. - She'll fit, Johnny. - Okay lover, but if she doesn't she's gotta go. - Johnny-- - Later, make it at one. - Yeah Johnny. - And a pint of the old stuff. No man, the old stuff. Well man? - It'll be 9.02. You got an ID card? - Yeah. - [Cashier] May I see it? - No. - That'll be, that'll be 10 even. [intense music] [cheerful music] [engine rumbling] [serene music] [gasps] - What's the matter? - Nothing. - You afraid of my mother? - No. - She won't bother you, I told her how shy you are. - No kidding. - I said, Mother if you come out of the house, Dave will just run away. - Oh whoa. [chuckles] Are you gonna give up? - Yes. - [Dave] Are you gonna be good? - Yes. You're sweet. - What a bad thing to say to a guy. - I don't care, you are. We'll have lunch on the patio and spend the whole afternoon together, just the two of us. - Well the gang's having a blowout. You know Johnny's racing today, I thought we'd fall by. - Can't we ever do anything without Johnny, just once? - I said I'd be there. - Do you always do what he says? - Well Johnny's top man. - Do you really believe that? - Well sure. I was nowhere before I met Johnny. He's big, he tuned me in. - You didn't need any tuning in. You wanna go, don't you? - You'll see, he's big man. [saxophone music] - I waited for you. - The scene was too lame. - Come home with me now. - Home? Old man out of town? I'll bet the big substantial would really flip if he knew about this lover. - Can't you leave him out of this? - Look honey, don't worry about it, I'm freezing the whole bit. - Johnny, speak so I can understand you. - Okay baby, I'll give it to you straight. It's over. - Why do you have to tease me like this? - You're not sounding me. It's over, O V E R. [saxophone music continues] - You don't mean that. - Don't I? - Why? - Look honey, we had a ball, now it drags, huh? - I don't mean to be possessive. Follow me home. - Split. - I won't ask you anymore questions. You can do anything you want. Please. - Look, will you get this through your head? I don't want you, you're old. I want a tender, young kitten. [upbeat music] - Dave, you're dragging your axle like a funeral. Step on it, man! - Do you have to do this just because Barny thinks it's smart? [tires screeching] - Pull over, man! - [Barny] Chickening! [car horn honking] - [Nancy] Turn! Turn! [car horn honking] [upbeat music] [engine revving] - Hey man, you leave your guts at home? Chicken. [engine revving] - For a minute I thought we were-- Why did you wait so long to turn? - I chickened. - We would've been hit. - He would've turned off. - When I think what almost happened. - He would've turned off, I tell ya. - I don't understand. I just don't understand. - Just forget it. [engine starts] [boat engine] [upbeat music] - Hiya Johnny how are ya? - Hey where's the beer, dad? - In the box. - Oh good. Only two? - Hey Mitch, dig the skinny boy. - Crazy. - You're gonna be big at the race today, man. - Big enough. - The furthest pad from the juice. [saxophone music] - No chick, she too good for our scene? - No man, I put her down. - Hey Johnny, I saw Dave and his chick parked on the wrong side of the street. What's happening? - [Barny] Nowhere, man. - What gives with Dave? What's happening with Dave? - [Barny] Ah it's too weak to tell. - Like I'm interested, man. - So like we're sleeping on 32 with Dave on the big side. - Yeah. - We're tickling on real nice, when this truck comes on and I give Dave this big chance. - Yeah? - He goes shallow, big time. - Shallow? - Dave chickened? - You should've heard his chick scream. - That does it, a bad chick, she is too far out. - Chick or no chick, he went shallow on sweet scene, that's all, shallow. - Hang easy man, I'll take care of Dave. Alright come on everybody, tune in on 670! - Hey Johnny, the juice. - Hey Cliffy, be a pal and toss me one. - Roll down here and get it yourself, big boy. [serene music] - Here chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick. - Come here, man. You came on pretty lame. Put down by a lousy truck. - Johnny. - You were always a top stud, you never went shallow before. - It just happened. - You tell me why. - I don't know, Johnny. - Then I'll tell you. It's that chick. - No Johnny. - Cool it. No more chicken scenes. - [Dave] Yeah sure, Johnny. - [Johnny] No more going shallow at the big moment for that chick. I told you she wouldn't fit. - [Dave] It wasn't her fault, Johnny. - She's out. Dig man, she's out. [smooth jazz music] [moaning] - Easy kitten, easy. Hey! [laughs] - Easy kitten, easy. - Real riot. - Relax, man. - Off my back. You want a fall guy, pick on the chicken. - [Johnny] Cool it. - Cliffy, make with the chicken bit. - Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick. [laughs] I'm a big truck man, honk, honk. I'm comin' for ya, I'm on ya man, honk, honk. - Please, please. - Stud's gone bad for a lame chick. - [Dave] I don't sound ya man. - You sound me. Dave, Dave! - Okay then. [loud thudding] Come on. [chatter] [water splashing] [loud thudding] - Drown him, drown him. [intense music] - You made a bad move, man. I'm gonna cut you up good. - Try that again, man, you'll see who gets cut up. - [Nancy] Let's go, Dave. - Cease man, it's over. Dave, come back here. - Later, Johnny. - Well what are you looking at? Are we gonna have blowout, we're celebrating a race! [upbeat music] - Honey, what are you thinking about? - Johnny. - You're with me and you're thinking about Johnny. - Yeah and when I'm with Johnny I'm thinking about you. That's nowhere. - Well what about him? - Well it's like Johnny's my best friend, and we can't even talk anymore. - You mean since you've known me. - Yeah, since I've known you. - I thought you were glad to know me. - Well I am. - Well then why do you talk this way? - You don't understand. - Oh yes I do. You care more about Johnny than you do about me. - That's not it at all. Can't you let me and Johnny still be friends? Do you have to have me all to yourself? - [Nancy] Well no. - Then what's all this about Johnny? - That's just not my idea of a friendship. - What do you know? Johnny was right about you. You don't understand anything. - Well if that's the way you feel, I guess there's just no point in seeing each other. - I guess there isn't. [dramatic music] [car engine rumbling] - I've had it man, I'm gonna fall by Dave's, I'll see you at the track. - Take it easy man. - [Cliff] Take it easy, Johnny. - Bye Johnny. - It's cool you guys, see you later. - Bye Johnny. Bye Johnny. - He's gonna fall by Dave's, swell. - So what? - If any one of us had played a scene like Dave, we'd have been down but good. - Ah it's the chick, she's asking for a lesson. - Big man is going weak. - Weak? He chickened a cop last night, remember? - [Cliff] Yeah, Johnny knows what he's doing. - Ah I'm getting hungry, let's split. - Yeah. [car horn honking] [music playing] - So what took you so long? What's the big idea cutting so fast? - [Dave] Well I'm sorry Johnny, but-- - You kiss the chick off? - Yeah. - Okay, that's more like it, things are picking up. Come on let's make it over to track. - I'm not going. - You're not going? Man, you never missed one of my races before. - I'm gonna call Nancy. - I give up, man. What are you gonna do that for? - I want her back, Johnny. - You don't want her back. You get yourself a new chick. - I'm not like you, Johnny, they don't fall all over me. - Don't worry about it, I'll see you get a new chick tomorrow. - I don't want a new chick. - Look man, she can't cut it, she doesn't dig our way. - I'm not so sure I dig our way either, Johnny. - Like what's wrong with it? We're swingin', man. You gotta snap out of this, the first thing you know you're gonna be sitting on a sofa watching TV, and that's the end, you might as well be dead. - Johnny, can you try to understand? Like when I chickened today, it wasn't her fault. - What are you giving me? - Well it wasn't. I don't know what made me do it. At first I couldn't believe it and I was mad at myself. But when I turned that wheel, I dug it Johnny, it made sense. - It didn't make any sense and you wouldn't have done it if that chick hadn't of been there. - No, Johnny like we're all the time doing things that don't make sense, like tearing things up. But with this chick I feel there's something besides tearing things up, something better. - Boy she has really got you mixed. From now on you're gonna do what I tell you to do. - Johnny, you're top man with me, but I gotta do this my way. - Do it your way!? You listen to me, from now on you're gonna do what I tell you. That chick doesn't even exist, and don't you forget it! Oh man that chick has bugged Johnny just once too often. She ain't gonna bother you anymore. Everything is gonna be cool. - No Johnny, it's big with her, real big. - She doesn't exist. [upbeat music] - Are we gonna be hung up here all day? - Don't sweat it, he'll be here. - Man this is a drag. - Ah cool it man, he'll be here! - Come on, I'll get you in. - Are you kidding? - You think he's the only one who can pull a stunt? - Ah we better wait, man. - Wait for what? If big man doesn't like it, he should get here on time. - What do you got in mind, man? - Go over by the gate and I'll show ya. - Okay big man. [car engines rumbling] [car horn honking loudly] - You got trouble? - Yeah I guess I'll have to yank the wires. - That's a shame. - What'd you say? - I said that's a shame. - Yeah, a real shame. - Here, let me try. [car honking stops] Eh hold up. You got a ticket? - I don't need one, man, I'm driving. Number five. - What's your name? - Johnny Varron. - Five. Okay, I'll check you off. [all chattering] - Hey Barny. - Wild scene man. - How'd you get in? - I told him I was Johnny. - Oh no. - Come on, let's go. [indistinct chattering] - Hey do you got a ticket? - I'm driving man, number five. - Uh what's your name? - Johnny Varron. - I've already got you checked off. Well okay, I guess you can go in. - [Announcer] Next Sunday we're gonna have a full afternoon of hot rod races. Two trophy matches for the two fastest and for the two slowest cars. An Australian race with a 50 lap main with an inverted start. It oughta be quite a show. So come out and be sure to tell your friends. - Hiya Johnny. - Hey Johnny, how's it going? - Who called this play? Suppose you sound me, man. - Just a little gag man, had to get in. - You told the cop you were me. - Didn't mean anything man, just a joke. - I'm already pretty full up on you today, man. - Okay, okay. Where's Dave? - He's not coming. - [Barny] Off with that lame chick. - Suppose you let me worry about Dave. Barny you're such a big man, I want you to run a little errand for me. I want you to put some green stuff on my back. - I thought this race was a sure thing? You're not betting? - I'm betting, just let your motor cool. [indistinct chattering] - Johnny. - Give me a 10 spot. - [Announcer] Attention please, ladies and gentlemen, there's a white ford, license number KJS565 blocking exit number five. Will the owner please see me? - Put this on my back, man. - Well look who's here. - Okay now play it cool because we're gonna have some fun, okay? - Where's Dave? - What do you want with Dave? - I just wanna see him, that's all. - Well sit down, Dave will be by in a minute. - Are you sure? - Yeah, sit down, watch the big man win a race. I'm splitting, you better hurry up and get that money done, time's running out. - Good luck Johnny. - Yeah see ya later, Johnny. - Goodbye Johnny. - Goodbye Johnny, good luck. - [Announcer] Attention, ladies and gentlemen, the next race will be the main event. 10 laps with six very proud toys. Driving one is Mark Dwyer, last year's champion, enough said. The new boy, Johnny Varron, number five, is driving Andy Berk's old car, the Shaper Special. This is the first time out for Johnny in this class of competition. Although we have two wins out of the seven starts that he was in this year. Art Sanders in 19. Art's been a regular in the front row for quite a few seasons. Incidentally, Art built his own car. - I told you last week this was an important race. - I'm here, don't sweat it. - You wanna drive my car, be here on time. - [Announcer] We're all happy - [Announcer] to see Gil, - Don't sweat it. - [Announcer] number four back with us for the first time this season since his accident last fall. Next to Shorty in the starting crib, there's a giant among men, Pee Wee Rawls, 6X. Teddy Davidson is driving 73, the very interesting new Sumpter Special with disc brakes and fuel injection. - Like let's get with it. Like move. - Yeah why don't you shut your face and stick to your driving? - Big man. Okay guys, let's make it. - [Announcer] Cars to grip please, cars to the grip. - Hey man, uh, what are the odds on Johnny Varron? - Two to one. - Here's a 10 spot to win. Covered? - To win, Johnny Varron. - [Announcer] The starter, Bill Sullivan, will do the introductions in just a moment, folks. [car engines revving] On the pole, Art Sanders. Mark Gwyer. [all cheering] The new boy, Johnny Varron. Teddy Davidson. Shorty Hill. And Pee Wee Rawls. [crowd cheering] The cars are being pushed off for their warm up lap. [car engines buzzing] 6X seems to be having a little trouble starting. Ah he's got it started now. They're forming up and jockeying for positions. And again they look pretty good, but no, not yet. And that's the green flag and they're off for 10 fast laps with number 19 on center jumping early. Johnny Varron in second, Mark Gwyer, Pee Wee Rawls and Shorty Hill. Shorty Hill got cut off during the first turn, right on top of Rawls now. Johnny Varron's hanging himself way out trying to take on Sanders from the outside, but Sanders won't budge. [all cheering] Shorty Hill just passed Rawls coming out of the south turn. [engine rumbling loudly] Here comes Teddy Davis, moving on the inside like a freight train. He's by Varron and he looks like he's got Sanders. Hold on, Varron's coming up on the outside and dives into the slot for first place. This makes it Varron, Sanders, Davis at the end of the third lap. Sanders goes high and wide, gets back into first place. Davis is pressing Varron. The order as they go into the fifth lap is Sanders in 19 first, Varron in number five, second, Davis in the jump is going third. Davis is in a big hairy slide, he's in trouble, he's off the course. I can't see if he's alright or not. Yes he's coming back out of the dust and moving back out on the track. What a race, folks. There goes Johnny Varron out in front again. Sanders is getting all out of shape trying to get back into the lead, he's pushing real hard. [all cheering] Mark Gwyer in number one is closing up fast. Now the seventh lap. Varron, Sanders and Gwyer, Davidson. [car engines rumbling] Sanders is closing fast on Varron. He's trying awful hard to get around him. When they cross the start/finish line this time folks, it leaves one more lap to go. Johnny Varron in five still holds the lead. Sanders in 19 is pushing for all he's worth. Here they come out of the south turn, Sanders is high and doing everything to pass Varron, but Varron is holding way to the outside, won't give him any room. Uh oh, Varron shut the gate but hard, Sanders is off the track. I can't tell if he's hurt or not. Well that's one way to win a race. Varron is on his last lap all alone. Here he comes in to the checkered flag. Johnny Varron first, Mark Gwyer second, Shorty Gill third, number 6X Pee Wee Rawls in fourth, and Teddy Davis. - Yeah go on I'll see ya later, I gotta collect. - Look at the weak kitten. - [Cliff] Come on. - It's funny Dave hasn't come. - [Barny] He'll be here, he'll be here. [upbeat music] - You call that driving? Huh? - [Johnny] It was an accident. - An accident? You lousy punk. You get yourself a new mechanic. - Take it easy. - You could've killed Sanders out there. I oughta break your head in. I waited for this for a long time, but it's all yours boy, I don't want any part of it. Now get out of here and stay out. - Gee man, thanks. - Well I'm sorry to bother you again, but-- she's still not in huh? [serene music] Well, would you have her phone me the minute she gets in please? Yeah thanks a lot. [upbeat music] - What now? - A social call. - Cut it. - It's a great race. Is that how you got Officer Neeley? - Come off it, will ya? - Officer Neeley is dead, I thought you might want to know. - Yeah well thanks a lot. - You wanna come down and have a talk with us? - Certainly. Now would you get out of the way, you're blocking the action. - We'll be seeing you. [crowd chattering] - You got something for me, man? - Yeah. - Who's top stud, man? - You're top stud. - Okay. Hey we're gonna go on the town. - Crazy, where too man? - I told Dave that if we didn't meet him at the races, we'd fall by Chubby's later. [all chattering] - Let's go, man. [upbeat jazz music] - I'm thirsty as all heck. - Now I certainly hope that no one creates a disturbance. - Ah don't worry about me Johnny, no disturbance. [upbeat jazz music continues] [phone ringing] - Hello Nancy. - Barny, got some news for ya man. Your chicks here. - What? - I'd make it, make it fast. - Where were you? - I had to make a phone call. - Yeah, who'd you call? - My mother. [sighs] - Service, service, come on. - Good work, Johnny. - Sure. - I know you kids are feeling pretty high, but take it easy in here. - Oh sure, dad. - I mean it. No cutting up. Since that cop died, the one who was run off the road last night, they've been watching me very close. - [Cliff] Died? - We dig you, man. - It's a good song. - Baby, let's go. - [woman] Come on. - Come on, let's cut a dance. - He'll be here. You buy, man. Come on, let's dance. - Looks like he's more than playing it. - What do you care? - Look at him, big man. What are you, his flunky? - Easy baby, cool it. - Brother, if Dave could see him now. - Come on, loosen up. How'd you like the race today? - I thought it was disgusting. [laughs] Did you have to hit that other driver? - Well you know, you gotta shake up the fans a little bit. - Now you'll never know whether you could've won without doing that. - Wow, you really are a drag. It's a good thing Dave's through with you. - Well I don't think he is. Besides, I'm not through with him. - He wants you to split. - I don't think so, he's just upset. And I'm not going to let him down. [upbeat jazz music] - [Johnny] Oh come on. - Johnny. I wanna talk to you. - So talk. - Not here, outside. - You got something to say, say it. - Is this the broad you put down, Johnny? - Is this the one who rubs your back so good? [loud slapping] - Hey man. - Hey buddy. - Alright hot shot, I warned you. Now take the rest of these bums and get out of here. - We haven't finished our drinks. - That's right, we paid for 'em. - Yeah. - Who do you think you are. - Cool it, we're leaving. - Well what do you say, let's dance. - Let's stay. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Naw we're splitting, it's a nowhere scene. - Johnny. I don't think I ever really knew you before. - So what? - What did I ever see in you? I've got to straighten myself out. - You gonna tell your husband? - I have to. - Suit yourself. - How could I have been so wrong? You're not a man. You're an arrogant little child. - Honey, you're a bad loser. - Hey Johnny let me see the trophy, I got a swingin' idea man. Crazy. - That chick of Dave's is too much, man, she's lousing up everything. Let's dump her. - We'll dump her alright, man, but not right now. She did Dave in, right? - Right. - Now we're gonna do Dave a favor. Hey Barny, come here. Let me take care of this. Gotta teach that chick a lesson. Gonna give her a real scare. That bad broad is never gonna mix up a top stud again. Gonna take a little ride out to our place off the highway. - With ya, man. - What's the matter, man? - I'm with ya, man. - It's cool. [upbeat jazz music] - What's happening? - Dave isn't going to be here. - He'll be here. - No, I'm going home. - No you're not. [squealing] Just open your mouth. Watch her, Cliffy. - Where are we going? - Watch, you'll see. - Hey Johnny, Johnny, like the wild one, man, like Marlon Brando. [tires squealing] [dramatic music] - Johnny, Johnny! - Easy, Dave. - You, why? You could have any girl and you had to take mine. - You've got it wrong, man. - You had to do it, Johnny. - I didn't do anything. - You had to spoil this too, Johnny! - Dave! - Dave! - I only did it to scare her, Dave! I did it for you! [car tires screeching] Dave, wait a minute. Let's go! [car horn honking] [dramatic music] - [Police Radio] Speeding on Highway 32, four miles north of town. - Let's cut 'em off. [dramatic music] [police sirens blaring] [car tires screeching] [loud crashing] [somber music] - She was big with you, man. [somber music continues] [crying softly] - Easy, man. - I killed him. - No ya didn't, man. - You were nowhere near him. - It was big with him, and I wouldn't listen, I just killed him. Just like I killed that cop. [police sirens blaring] - Let's split, this is a drag. - Yeah. - What about Johnny? - Stud's gone bad, let's split. - We're with ya, big man.
