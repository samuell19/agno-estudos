"This information is issued in public interest." "She's the tough lady." To hell with them. What sort of flyers they paste here? Country is ruined with these ads. What's this? Increase your sex power?! Why do you stick these obscene flyers on your vehicle? It wasn't me. Even if you didn't, you could take them off. I am tired to. These guys stick a new bill every day. If I take one down, there's a second one stuck underneath. Why do you have a problem, mister? Why wouldn't I have a problem? If you keep watching the same ad over and over again, even the fittest of men will feel weak. I'm feeling weak. You're being unbelievable. What weakness? Yes, man. If men had erectile dysfunction, we wouldn't be so overpopulated. - Understood? - I do. I do. Everyone's having children. Can I go, uncle? This... Effects of erectile dysfunction. You sit. Yes, I understood. Pay for your ticket, madam. Ticket?! Ticket?! Which month, dear? - October. - Yes. - October? - Yes, ticket? - I meant your pregnancy. - Anybody wants the ticket? Oh this... eight months. - Oh, I see. - Keep moving. Is this your first or second child? - Third child! - Yes. Seriously? What are you planning to call him? 'Shut...' If it's a girl. 'Up' if it's a boy. In case they are twins we'll call them 'shut up. I see. You scared me. Does anything scare you? I mean... nice name. 'Shut up.' Chanderi. Chanderi. Out of my way. Anyone for Chanderi? Get ready to get down at Chanderi. Well, aunty, hope I never see you again. Let's go. See less of your husband. "People have said this." "Everybody has said this." "Even the scholars have said this." "This girl is crazy." "This girl is crazy." "She thinks of something.." "and does something else." "This girl is crazy." "Devi Prasad and Fathers Event Company." "From Birthdays to Funerals," "we plan all events to your satisfaction." Mister, are you Devi Prasad? Does any other name suit this face? - No. - Then it's me. So mister, how can I be of service to you? - What all do you do? - Everything. Weddings, engagements, tonsures, circumcision, birthdays, funerals, we organize everything, for the right price. Circumcision too? Yes, of course. I am so popular.. ..that people invite me from faraway places for circumcision. "With her arrival, comes the spring." "An intoxicating personality.." ..is my sweetheart." She is amazing! - Isn't she? - Yes, she is. What did you say? What did you say? Not the hair. Not the hair. If he grabs your hair, you'll get in trouble. Then how about I grab his face. He's got a pointed face anyway. Come inside, I'll show you. Broter. Sit. Sit. Take this pen and paper. And write 101 times, "Manokamna Tripathi is my sister." She is your sister, not mine. - You write it. - Right again. I'll kick you so hard, you'll land in the fort of Gwalior. - No, no... - What's going on here? Sister. Sister. You are my sister. Why is he calling me sister? He is getting emotional. He has no sister. Only four brothers, and two fathers, there are only men in his family. The only feminine object in his house is a cycle. So he requested me, to find him an adorable sister. And I complied. Take your sister's blessings. - Sister. - Get lost. Don't you dare come here again! - You are absolutely crazy. - Yes, I am. Why did you call me here? Sit. No, sit here. Look. It's wheat beer. Low fat, no-calorie. Where did you find these? It's practically unavailable in Chanderi. I got it for you, especially from Gwalior. You take good care of me. We are good friends. It's the least I can do for you. Only two for now. See you. "This is my favourite sweet. Try it." Of course. There she is. Where were you, Manu? I've been trying to call you, but you weren't picking up. Come, sit. Sit down. Sit. She is our daughter Manu. That's Nilu. Aunty, that's Nilesh. He gave his approval seeing your picture. - Really? - Yes. - Uncle, do you mind? - Why? Can we talk? Okay, child. Come. Please. Do you follow me on Instagram? No. - Twitter? - I'm not on it. - Facebook. - Don't have an account. - Do you have an account anywhere? - In SBI. SBI? - Yes! - He has an account in SBI. How many kids have you planned after marriage, Nilu? You're stuck in the process, focus on the result. Have you made any plans? We'll discuss that post-marriage. No. Even two kids are fine when planned, without any planning even one is wrong. Yes, of course. I liked one thing about you. And what's that? Normally, people enquire without neighbours before choosing a girl. But you chose me.. ..directly from my photo. Thank you so much. Nilesh, being tall, dark, handsome... which you are not. But I like you. Very good. Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! - This calls for a celebration. - Congratulations to you too. By the way, what time do you sleep at night? I normally sleep late. 9 o'clock. I mean we sleep right after watching 'Taarak Mehta'. 'Taarak Mehta.' I was planning on chatting with you the whole night. But you.. I can stay awake. You can call at any time. Then note it down. 984735219 Note it. Noted. Is it? Very good. We'll chat every night. Right, papa? - Fine, but the mobile number... - I've memorised it, uncle. I mean, papa... Okay, then I'll call you tonight before 'Taarak Mehta'. - Of course. - Let's go. - Let's discuss this first. - She is absolutely right. Only after we are familiar. We will inform the priest. - Alright. - We don't need the priest at present. - Alright. - Yes. Family seems nice. Come over to see girls. Why don't they look at their own boy first? - Mom. - Yes. I'll beat you to a pulp. Sit down quietly. And you. How long will you keep driving boys away like this? And again you gave him the wrong number. Doesn't matter if you gave him the wrong number. But why give him my number? Even last time you gave my number to two other guys. They send me heart emojis at 4 am. Just yesterday, I got a WhatsApp message from a guy, asking "sweetheart, why do you have your old father's picture on your DP". Are you not her father? I am, but why did he have to mention 'old'? What did he see lacking in me? Stop your wailing. Understood. And you... What are you giggling about? I need to know clearly when you'll get married. After I become independent, and build a career. How long do you need to build a career. Manu, listen. You can make a career after marriage. - Did you make one? - How could she? - She failed class 10. - What did you say? Couldn't you say studied till class 9? - It's the same thing. - How is it the same thing? We have four kids, don't we? Did I ever ask why we never had a fifth one? This is no place to discuss these things. - Are you crazy? - Yes, I am crazy. Manu... Wait. Wait. Why don't you want to get married? This is why I don't want to. You two never did any planning, and had four children. - Wait, Manu. - Wait right there. - How brazen she has become? - Manu, listen. Talking rubbish. What did you say? What did you say? - What was it? - You see, without the fourth child, you wouldn't have anyone to tie 'rakhi' to. This 'rakhi' debate is why, the population of our country is heading to 1.5 billion. I'll first get a job and then get married. - It's decided. - Listen. I've had enough of your drama. First, you said you'll complete your BA, then get married. Then you said you'll complete your MA, then get married. Now you are saying you want to get a job. Yes, I do. I don't want to be dependent on my husband. You do? Okay, fine. I'll give you a month. Get a job. Even the termination period is more than a month, - how can I find a job? - That's your problem. Either you find a job in one month, or else, Nilu has already given his approval. Understood. Was I right, dear? Well, you never think before you speak. Crazy people. The post of marketing executive... No, sir. I... It's been filled. I was calling for a job interview. Can I come over? 11 o'clock, sir. Done. - What is this? - Resume. We mentioned MBA in our newspaper ad. And you're only MA. You're missing a 'B' here. Sorry, sir. We need someone with at least 1 or 2 years of experience for this job. But you're a complete fresher. I am sorry. You all may leave. The job has been given to someone else. What's this? Since you're a double-graduate, we're willing to pay you 12,000. I'll be rid of all my debts. Get my sister married. Pay for my mother's eye surgery. And can you suggest me where I can invest the money that I save? Huh? 12000. By the way, why does a beautiful girl like you, need a job? Sir, this is how I look in reality. Can I get the job now? Manu! The beer is factory-made, but the liver is your own. - Don't drink so much. - Why shouldn't I? Even my double-graduation is of no help. I can't get a decent job. 500 applications for a single job. Talented people have no value in this country. You're right. That's why. That's why Sundar Pichai had to go out of the country. Who's this Sundar Pichai? Don't you know him? I only know one significance of Sundar (beautiful). Manokamna Trpathi. He's Google's CEO. - Oh, the Google CEO? - Yes. You mean that Sundar? Why didn't he search a job on Google? Why was he searching on his own? Can anyone gets a job on Google? It's just a job. Not true love that you can't find one. You don't understand, Devi. Careful. Careful. Careful. Careful, Manu. - The country is overpopulated. - Careful. It's no use living here. - Hey! - It's enough, Devi. - Hey, girl! - Get down. - No, no, no... - It won't happen. Wait, let me park the scooter. We're four kids. - You know what? - Don't jump. Hey, girl. Don't do it. And the population is still increasing. - What are you doing? - And.. Hey... Please don't commit suicide. No, no, no... What are you doing? What do you think you're doing? Even I never held Manu so closely? Can't even have some beer now? Weren't you giving up your life? I am so broke, I can't give anything. Ohh... aren't you that girl from the bus? The pregnant girl. - Was it a boy or a girl? - When? I was not pregnant. It was a pillow fastened to my stomach, to get a seat. Out of my way. - What? - You dropped my beer. - Devi, where is my beer? - There it is, Manu. Look... I think it fell over here. Shell out 540 rupees. - 540? - You spilt my beer. But the beer costs only 150 rupees. Devi, tell. Costs 150 rupees when the shop is open. I stuck my head inside a window ye small, and grabbed this bottle with my teeth. It's wheat beer. No fat, no calories. Available for 530 rupees. Pay up. What do you mean? - The bottle could be empty too. - Let's throw you down. - Go take a look. - No, no. Empty bottles has many more uses. They could be worth much more. Use it as a water bottle, or use it in the toilet. Use it to fire rockets on Diwali, or grow money plants. And when someone doesn't pay up, you can smash that empty bottle on his head. - Do you understand? - Hard not to understand, when you explain so clearly. I must admit. You can sell these usual stuff amazingly. Very nice. - Did you hear? - Yes. What's the point, uncle? I can't get a job. I'm using my biodata to hold my snacks. See. Are you serious? So sad. This is really very sad. I don't want any sympathy award. - Just give us the money. - Oh, money. There are 10 rupees extra. Okay. - Let's go. - Yes. Let's go. Your time limit is over. Now you must get married. - I won't marry Nilu." - What? I said I won't marry Nilu. Why won't you marry Nilu? He's a nice guy, has a decent salary. Won't marry him. Yes, sister, even I found him pretty cool. Brother-in-law Nilu. Brother-in-law? These Nilu, Tiku, Ramesh, Suresh, and Raju, come under the brother-in-law category. Cool is Hrithik, Rahul, Raj. And I even heard he's got two missing toes. Are you planning to elope with him? Nobody is perfect. Listen, wise guy, you don't have to marry Nilu if you don't want to. There are other guys in Chanderi. Marry one of them. Sister, your phone's been ringing for so long. Disturbed my beauty sleep. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes. Of course. I'll come right away. Right away. Jyoti, turn on the geyser. I've to shower and leave. Where are you going? To become independent. Put in the batch number. What's this? Loading at this hour? - Where are you going? - It isn't going anywhere, sir. It's coming back. Coming back. Why? The condoms have expired. They are not selling. - See... - See what? - This was strawberry flavour. - Yeah. It now smells like rotten strawberries. What do we do? Shut down the factory? No, no, no need to shut it down. Look at the factory's condition. In a few days, it will... - What do you mean? - I mean... What do you mean? - You mean this building's dilapidated? - No, no, sir. - The building will fall on our heads - Sir, that's not what I... - That's what you meant. - Good morning, sir. Manokamna. - Yes. - You're here. Yes. 40,000 per month? I'm ready to do the job, sir. My family will be very glad. That's a lot of money for making umbrellas. Umbrellas? Not umbrellas... It's not what you think it is. Not umbrellas? No, these are umbrellas. Definitely. - But... - No ifs or buts, sir. - Just pay me 15,000 advance. - What? I didn't understand. Why is that? You see, sir, in our country some people need evidence for everything. And especially my family. Sir, she getting misled. First, explain her job profile. Okay. Okay. I was saying, let's first understand what you've to do. Leave it. Job done. Just pay the advance. Okay, fine. I mean... Here's your advance. Done, sir. I'll see you day after tomorrow. Why not tomorrow? Because tomorrow never comes, sir. See... - Thank you. - Very nice. Smart. Good. Good. Good. So, Devi, you wish to marry Manu. Yes, uncle. What's why I mustered the courage to come up to you? And also prepared this PPT. It's too good, son. Too good. Didn't understand a thing, son. Let me explain. PPT means... Lord, you should have put in subtitles in Hindi. Would have been easier for the masses to understand. The rest is in Hindi. - Care to explain. - Look... I have planned everything from the wedding to old age. Your Manu won't find a better suitor than me. - Ask why. - Don't bother. I'll tell you. I've written that down too. Yes. See, point no. 1; Manu will decide all my mobile passwords. Wow. Smart boy. Point no.2; Not so close. I am explaining. - I see... - Explain. Explain. Manu will drink the saffron milk on our wedding night. And I won't mind if she falls asleep afterwards. Great. Heard that. Very nice. Next? Next? Well... men don't have an option of becoming pregnant, otherwise, I would've opted for that too. And saved Manu from getting out of shape. Manu always insists that we should know the suitor. And you've known Manu since childhood. Not just Manu, I know her mom pretty well. Do tell. You've a rod in your left leg. Oh no. I see... That's why she often walks crooked. - Isn't it? Isn't it? - Yes. I'll use this rod to shove up your backside. There's no need for too much information. Here's a question. - Didn't you start a new shop? - Yes. - Does it do any business? - Yes, son. Any business? What is she asking? I know it doesn't do any business, you tell them. It's a hit. That's great. I just wish Manu gives her approval. Mother. Please handle it. - I will. - Mom. Mom. Mom. Here comes my child. Sweeten your mouth. Come on. Why do you sweeten our mouth, sister? What's the occasion? What has happened? Have some. Good. - Bless me. - God bless you, son. God bless you. God bless you. - Devi. - Yes. Why are you taking my parent's blessings? For which you've sweetened our mouth. It's a lucky day. Oh yes... - I got a job. - Really? - So you're celebrating your new job. - Yes. And you have no idea about the marriage. Marriage? See you later. There's a huge patch I've to stitch. See you later. - Whose marriage? - Your marriage, child! Again? Mom... With who? Who is it, Devi? Devi? I... I've no clue. I came to check whether you guys have electricity. - Manju... - Hey... I mean, Manju aunty, do you have electricity? Yes, we do. We had a power cut. - But.. - What is this? Belongs to the company. What a crazy guy? One minute he was saying one thing, and now he's saying another. - Leave him. - Leave it. Sit. Here... Here you go. - I got a job. - Where? It's a company that makes umbrellas. 40,000 per month? Wow, sister! 40,000 rupees per month?! Good Lord! I told you our daughter is a double graduate. She will find a job. But you were in a hurry to get her married. - Hi, sir. Good morning. - Hi. Good morning... - You are here? - Now tell me... what do I have to do. Of course. This. This. This is what you've to do. But not on the TV. We'll do it together. - Okay? - What is this? It's a condom. You don't know? Look respected, but you're such a creep. - What are you... - Bloody old man! - What is this language? - Ready to kick the bucket! - Pervert! Uncouth! - You are getting me wrong. There's a decade of an age difference between you and me. I know. How can you come up with such a filthy thought? Wrong. - I'll show you. - Very bad. I'll expose you publicly. How dare you show me a condom? Bloody old man! - Listen... - It will be done. You know, make some khakra and fafda flavours for our Gujarati brothers, and tobacco flavour for the UP guys. Sir, we're thinking about launching cardamom, jasmine, and mint flavours. Sir, quality-wise we must ensure, that they don't tear and has extra dots. This is a condom company? I've been trying to tell you that. See... We make all this. You got me all wrong. Why didn't you tell me earlier? I've been trying, dear. For ages. But no one listens to me. Sir, I cannot do this job. Why? Your advance. I'll return your advance as soon as I get another job. And one more thing. Please be more specific about what you sell. You have put up 'Little Umbrella' everywhere. That's what it is. The name of our company. Little Umbrella. We want it to shine. But currently, it's in the shadows. Loss-making. We want to hire a girl like you. Talented. Who can help fill this void. It's not like I've a diploma in selling condoms. - This isn't right, sir. - That's not it. Listen. Manokamna. Bloody idiot. Hey. Hey. Sorry. Come. Come, Manokamna. This is your desk. Sit here. Please take your seat. Sit. Sit. Sit down. And from tomorrow begins your fieldwork. Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir, these are a few new samples from our company. What's the point of these samples, madam? Not even a single box is sold yet. I see... Do you need anything? These are some new flavours from our company, and here are some samples. I've never heard about your condoms, or seen any commercial. How will it sell? Being a girl you are selling condoms, sister. Doesn't look nice. If it's a money problem, then you can tell me. I can help you. No one's going to buy this Little Umbrella, madam. What is this? There's an umbrella printed on the packet. If it was some hot model... If it was some hot model wearing a two-piece, hugging a guy. That excites the buyer. Madam, listen. Madam... What do you want, madam? This... is not what I want. Uncle, the graveyard is on the other side. Shut up. And come here. The last time I asked you for a pack of 10, and you gave me only three. Uncle, looking at your condition, even three seemed impossible to me. Enough of your wisecracks, and get me a pack of 10. I cannot come repeatedly. My house is on the third floor. Climbing up and down so often is not easy. You should be thanking God. If your house was on the 20th floor, you'd be sucked up into heaven. Stop this rubbish. And get me a pack with a nice flavour. I am, uncle, I am. Don't get so restless. Chewing my brains. - I will be back. And hurry up. If I am late, my missus will think I'm dead. - Uncle. - Yes. Take this. Can you climb up to the third floor? Third... Uncle, this is my company's condom. I'm doing promotions. It's been 75 years and three nights, and I never saw any female promoting this. I cannot change my gender to sell condoms. How much do you buy a pack for? 100 rupees for a pack of 10. 100 for 10? Here you go, uncle. Pack of 20 for 100 rupees. Great! 20! Amazing. - Are the flavours any good? - Huh... - What's going on here? - Wait just a minute. - Here you go. - Hurry up and give it before it becomes extinct. This is going to make things extitement. That's excitement, uncle. Whatever. But it's gonna be a lot of fun. "This girl is crazy." "This girl is crazy." Madam, what did you do? Keep this. And I'll tell you what to do. Condom sale. Yes, sir. At 50% What are you saying? 50% sale on condoms. Will they sell? Like hotcakes, they will. What are you saying? I don't believe you. I don't... - No, no, no. - Sir, this is India. People buy anything that's on sale, even if they don't need it. - That's not true. - Listen to me. Sell the old batch lying in the warehouse at 50% discount. Why are you sending a new batch? Uncle! - Uncle! - Uncle! He was my uncle! Not your uncle. You were my uncle's batch mate. Don't talk rubbish. Uncle. What have you done? First, aunty died six months ago, and now you. Are you two buying a plot on the moon? - What are you saying? - Uncle! Uncle! Now, who'll order foxnuts for snacks? Uncle! - Let's go, son, it's getting late. - Uncle! - Let's go, Devi. - Uncle! - No, no, please! - Lift him up! I'll be in the front. - Fine, you can be in the front. - I'll be in the front. How can you be on both sides? - No. - Let them lift him up. - Lift him up! - I'll be on that side. Come on. Come this side. Come on. Uncle. "Lord Rama is the ultimate truth." "Lord Rama is the ultimate truth." "Lord Rama is the ultimate truth." "Lord Rama is the ultimate truth." Morning 7 am, he said to get me some foxnuts. Hello, Devi. Manu. Hello. Hello, Devi. Hello. Hello. Can't hear a thing. Hello. - Hello. - Who is it? - Is it dead? - In the morning. Not him. The mobile. Hello. Hello. - Hello. - Can you hear me now? Yes. Can you help me out? You helped me by saying this. Devi, I need a lot of men. What... What rubbish is this? Hear me out first. I mean a place where I can find a lot of men together. Listen, Manu. How about a couple of dozen? Perfect. Meet me behind Raja Rani Palace. Behind Raja Rani Palace? See you there. - Where do we go? - Uncle is no more! Listen, gather more men on the way. - Why? - Just do as I said. Uncle is no more! Listen, guys. We'll take this route. Call everyone. Come, brother. Let's take you to a place, where people are dying to go. Come, brother. Come on. Join us. Come on. - "Ram's name..." - "Is true." - "Ram's name..." - "Is true." - "Ram's name..." - "Is true." - "Ram's name..." - "Is true." Hold this for a minute. I'll be right back. What's this? Manu. Whose funeral is that? It's my uncle. Never was of any use to me while he was alive, but he's coming in handy after he's dead. But why did you bring him here? Man! Man! - This man. - Yes, he's a man. I mean I haven't checked personally. But he's a man in general. Devi, you're good for nothing. You'll never change. You got this man for me. What kind of men are you looking for? I mean if it's a foreigner you want... I don't want anything. Take him back. I am leaving! Listen, Manu. What kind of man do you want? Take uncle the other way. Why? This man had always treaded on the wrong path. Manu. - Stop. Stop. - Keep moving. Are you missing your flight? Keep moving. Keep moving. Moving pretty fast. Go ahead. Keep moving. We'll have a party. See you at night. Excuse me. Sister. Hello. How are you? - Sister who? - You didn't recognise me. We just met the day before yesterday at your brother's wedding. You were feeding your rather large kids. How is brother-in-law? Brother-in-law who? And stop calling me sister. This is absolutely wrong. I know the hormones change after marriage, but you cannot forget my brother-in-law. Even I had an aunt who had a moustache and a beard, but, I never stop believing she is a female. We did. But you fail to admit it. - Can't you see? - See what? That I'm a boy, not a girl. No, no, I don't believe you. - Do you believe him? Do you? - No. No one here believes you. Sister, if you call yourself a male, while sitting on the ladies seat, then who will believe you? Something is definitely wrong. Get yourself checked. Go on. - Get aside. - Sister... Please sit. Manu. Manu. Manu. - Hop on. - Why? - I said hop on. - I've to go to work... I'll take you somewhere worth your while. - But where? - Do you trust me? Do you? This is a tough competition. Is there any wrestler... See, Manu. Men. And they are even alive. [Crowd Cheering] Wrestler Rama has suddenly changed the geme and pinned down wrestler Mukund. Yeah... - Let's go. - Where? - Just come with me. None of the tricks are working on Rama. Everybody has failed. They are trying to save their honour. Once again Rama has help Mukundi Note down my offer too. And there he is, Mukundi is back on the ground. Amazing. Awesome. And this victory deserves another round of applause. Wonderful! And the winning wrestler from Unnao city of Lucknow, receives 2100 rupees from Champak Lal. Bravo. And a cash prize of 1100 rupees from Kishen Lal as well. And a pack of suiting and shirting. And a family pack of 10 condoms from Little Umbrella company. Clap! Who wrote this? Who wrote it? I did. I did. Manu. Just a minute. I'm coming. Condoms! What is this? Give me the mic. I'll explain. What's this? Shame. Shame. Winning a wrestling bout alone doesn't make you a man! Wearing a little umbrella is the mark of a real man! The mark of courage, strength, and confidence of every man! Little Umbrella Condoms! What rubbish is this? Is this a joke? One more thing. For the first time in your city, there's a sale on condoms. Mister. Is she with you? - Her? - Yes.

You know what... Hello. Why are you getting so restless? The show won't start without Manu, understand? Hang up. Crazy guy. - We're late because of you. - I wonder why you're yelling at me. - Manu. - There.. Hello, uncle. Hello, aunty. - Hope you had a pleasant trip. - We just live a block away. - That's true. - Devi, has Krishna entered yet? How can anyone enter without you? Come, uncle. Come, aunty. Come, Rinku. Looking nice. - Come, madam. - Please, be seated. - Get up, mister. - This is my seat. - Did you win it in the elections? - Yes. Then get up. - Come on. - Crazy guy. - Sit down. - Go on. - Shall we begin? - Yes. Uncle, sit... Sit, uncle. - Glory to... - Lord Ram. 'Every time the religion is in danger..' Devi, how did Rama come in Mahabharata. He spent 14-years in exile even in Ramayana. Do you want to be exiled too? - No. - Then sit. - Come on. - He has lost it. "Be my saviour, Lord." Drag that chambermaid out here! - Leave me! Leave me! - "I am in danger." "I am in danger." "Be my saviour, Lord." - Lord Krishna enters. - Glory to God. Seek His blessings. Whenever righteousness is harmed, I manifest myself on earth. To protect the good, and destroy evil. That Krishna is the guy I was telling you about. From the red-light district. Imagine... they cast him as Krishna. Here he's saving Draupadi's honour as Krishna, and he was charging women money in the red-light district. He's lousy boy. "I am in danger." "Be my saviour, Lord." "Be my saviour, Lord." "I am in danger." Stop the show! Stop it! Let me talk to them. Come with me. Devi... Easy. What's wrong, man? This man has committed a grave sin. We won't let this sinner, perform such a pious show. Take off this peacock feather crown! - Calm down. - You're fit to play Kans. This is supposed to be Draupadi's disrobing, not mine. Take it off. - Calm down, Devi. - At least tell me what I've done. - What have you done? - Here you pose as God, and you go seeking pleasure in the red-light district. - Why you... - Stop! Stop! - Again you've started. - Stop! If I'm found guilty, you can strip me naked. But first, tell me who told you this. Who? - Who? - Yadav told me. - Panditji told me. - Panditji? I heard it from Guptaji. - Who told you? - Chaurasiya. Chaurasiya. Who told you? Makdoom told me. I did? Yes, I did. I heard Manu say it. Who is Manu? She is Manu. I see. So, you're Manu. How do you know I was in the red light area? Were you there? Tell me. I went there to finalise a deal for the show. Stripped me naked for a rumour. Why is there a power cut? Who turned off the lights? I think the transformer is blown away. Only my house has power cut it seems. Hey. What happened to the lights? Everyone else in the neighbourhood has electricity? Why is there a power cut in our house? Find out. It's not a power cut! - I turned it off. - Why? Why? The electricity bill is 9000 rupees. This is why. The TV is always on. On one side, the water is getting heated, and here, it's getting cooled in the fridge. Why can't you settle for normal water? Even after getting charged 100%, mobiles stay plugged in for hours. Fans and children are the only things that hover nonstop. If this continues, each one will have a separate meter. Everyone can pay their own bill. - Uncle. - Why would you do that? But why turn off the lights to explain this? No one's getting my point, father. Vijay, go turn on the lights. - He's on that side. - Huh... - That side. - Going, grandpa. And where's Mr. Actor? - Who, uncle? - My last blunder. Oh, I see. He's either playing Rama, or Laxmana, or Ravana, but never could be anyone on his own. Your days are numbered. Uncle was just asking about you. Welcome. Welcome, TT sir. Will you contribute to the household expenses, or waste your time doing drama? - Where... - Each one pays 2500 rupees. - 2500? - 2500? I'll pay the rest. Hemant hasn't made a single sale since last week. And his security guards quit. And why... don't you ever ask him? Is Mr. Manoranjan in? It's Manoranjan, no need to be so formal. I mean Manoranjan. We came to book him for Ramleela. Get lost! Uncle, please. Don't be so mean. We even brought advance money. Hail Lord Bajrangbali. - Isn't this amazing? - Sorry, I cannot do it. Why? Papa has a problem with me playing God. I'm busy. He'll do it. He's got time. You're as free as the soap that comes free with the shampoo. - Take it, son. Do it. - Take it. Take it. - If you insist.. - He'll do the show. 11th Sunday. Remember the date. So long, uncle. Let's go. Come on. 10,000 rupees. On the occasion of paying homage to Chaunkelal. I would like to consummate Mr. Keval, It's not consummate... That's 'persuade'. Right. Consummate won't be correct. To kindly take charge of the mic, and grace us with a few words. Please. Never imagined this day would come. When we'll have to say, that Chaunke's no more. This time I'm running as a candidate for the village chief elections. This was Chaunke Lal's last wish. I request you to vote for... What for? Vote. Vote for... - Vote for who? - Okay, we won't. - What are they saying - Vote. Pardon me. Vote for me. Say so in English. We'll observe a minute's silence in memory of the deceased. Together. Stand up. Where did everyone go? I guess they went to see Ramleela. Why didn't you go too? You should have gone too. I'm the tent and chair supplier. And he has no legs. He's been urging me to leave. Why call me if you can't control the crowd? Come on. 7500 for me and 2500 for you. - What? - 2500 The deal was 5000 rupees. The deal was to perform Krishna-Leela, but did you complete the show. Did you? We came with the same intention. I just got a new girlfriend. Even her mobile recharge costs 2600 rupees. You've really blinded in life and otherwise. This is all I have. Adjust with. Even if the play got interrupted, but I got a clean shave. You've to pay for that. You got the full make up. And you were looking most beautiful of them all. Doesn't matter if he was looking beautiful or not. We won't accept anything less than the deal. And it wasn't our fault in the first place, it was that girl. She wasn't any relative of mine. She wasn't my relative either. This is your problem. Deal with it. Look. There comes your problem. Good, you're here. Come. Ruin us. Wipe my existence from this planet? I came to say sorry. Sorry? I see. Then say sorry. - Sorry? - I won't forgive you. You had me stripped publicly for no fault of mine. So I said I'm sorry. Listen, why don't you leave a couple of apologies with me? We'll distribute it equally. You won't have to come every time. - Sorry. - Let him go. Pay us the money. Give us our money. I admit it's my fault. - I said I'm sorry. - At least you admit it's your fault. You know what, I went to take booking for a show, what were you doing in the red-light district? I'm a sales executive at Little Umbrella company. So? It's a condom company. I was promoting my condoms. - You sell condoms? - Yes. You seem shocked like I'm selling your kidneys. - Do you have a problem? - No. But... I never heard a female selling condoms. - Especially in Chanderi. - You heard it now. So... do you play Holi? Do I? I'm so good at holi, that my family had to wash a dozen faces, to find out which one's their son. Fine, this time you play with me. Why? Because I've heard Holi is a festival where enemies turn friends, And friends... Friends? I'll be waiting. Brother. Don't mind, it's Holi. I do mind. I do mind. I do mind. Do you want to play Holi? What's his fault? Devi. Devi. Devi. - Let him go. - - What? "Month of spring upon us," "my eyes begin to glisten." "Feeling overwhelmed by beloved," "what is this effect of love?" "Sprayed me all over with your colour," "I was impressed when you winked at me." "Sprayed me all over with your colour," "I was impressed when you winked at me." "Never seen such a sight," "where the world seems so colourful." "Love's in the air," "Radha frolics in Brij." "Overwhelmed by love," "Radha frolics in Brij." "Love's in the air," "Radha frolics in Brij." "Overwhelmed by love," "Radha frolics in Brij." "You're such a flirt," "still single at heart." "In your drunken stupor," "you sprayed your colour on me." "Everyone in the neighbourhood is annoyed," "how do I change you?" "What to do?" "Silk dress coloured in pink." "piercing eyes, intoxicating is your gait." "I'm determined you'll be mine." "Golu's sister-in-law you shall be." "Lost my heart in the month of spring," "lost everything." "Love's in the air," "Radha frolics in Brij." "Colours flying in the air," "Radha frolics in Brij." "Love's in the air," "Radha frolics in Brij." "As your gaze crossed mine," "Makes my heart race," "Feel disinterested. What is this amazing feeling." "Makes my heart restless," "Waiting to get a glimpse of you." "Singing only your tunes. What is this awesome feeling." You've defamed us in the society. This wasn't our upbringing. Whose sin is this? Whose sin is this? Tell me. Whose sin is this? Tell me. Whose sin is this? Mom, it's called a condom, not sin. Are you drunk? Did you expect me to be sober at this hour? Condoms are lying on the table. Look what's lying there. See. Get up. Take a look. - What is it? - See. - What is it? - See. Is this happening? Will you keep looking or say something? They are not mine. You know, I... Leave it. You didn't use it when you should have. How can they be yours? - And you... - Mom, you see... Be quiet. You don't have to take their side. Look at her. Take some lessons from your sister. Poor soul works hard all day. She goes from pillar to post selling umbrellas. With such honesty, she never brought a single umbrella home. And you two are making merry. Hear me out, mom. Hear what, mom? Whose is it? Whose is it? I will kill you. Tell me. - Mom. - They are mine. Don't lie! Don't lie to me, understand! I am not lying. They are mine. They are yours. Yes. God. Look at this. Look. Look at this. Look at your innocent little sisters. - How will this affect them? - Imagine... People find rats, snakes, scorpions, iguanas in their homes, and what do we find? Condom. Yes, because I work for a company that makes condoms. Little Umbrella. You... said you work for some company that makes umbrellas. Is this the umbrella? Yes. You mean... This is the umbrella I kept asking you for? Yes. God... Mother Shitla... This is how she's been paying the bills. Mother Shitla... I admit I kept it a secret, but what's wrong in it? Why keep it a secret if it's not wrong? Even he kept a secret from me before marriage. Your father used to sell underwear and vests. Undergarments. Lingerie. No 'below the belt' comments, please. What are underwear and vests? Quiet. Have some shame. Think about the society. At least think about us. What will the relatives think? I know negative and positive. But I've not understood what is relative. When Jyoti failed in class 10, relatives had called up. But when she passed in first rank in college, nobody called up. These relatives are very selfish. They didn't contribute in my life. They know nothing. They've no right to say anything. I want to change this thinking. You can't even change the bed sheet. How will you change the thinking? Let me make one thing clear. I won't stay another minute in this house. - No, no... - No, I am leaving. - Don't go now. - It's too late now. You can leave in the morning. Be quiet... You can either keep me in this house, or your daughter. Oh my God! Mom, you're getting annoyed with me as if I invented condoms. It's a simple job, simple routine. I draw a salary. I leave on time and return on time. Why are you worried? Okay, fine. If you still have any doubts, then come to the factory with me tomorrow. But you won't. I know. Because you trust me. And you know I will never break your trust. My child. On that note, let's have a couple of large ones. Pancakes. The round-shaped ones. It's been a while since you last made them. Makdoom bro, for the first time I didn't enjoy Holi. How could you? How could you? Lovers like you boost Arijit Singh's career. No sooner do guys like you have a heartbreak, he comes out with his new album. Forget her, bro. Forget about Manu. How can I forget her? "How can I forget her?" Makdoom, never say this to me again. Manu dwells in me. How do you know that I like wheat beer? Get her out of there. In fact, I can hear her voice out here. Imagine how much I love her. I don't even love her, but why can I hear her voice? You should know. You can hear her too? Tell me. Your intentions should be clear. And I'm very clear since childhood. - Devi. Devi bro... - Yes. Today.. Where? How many friends do you drink with at this late hour? People who call beer alcohol, are the people who call jackfruit, meat. Beer is a beer. He's the same guy. The other day on Holi, who was that sad-looking guy? Who, Devi? He was my brother. Devi. I see... he looked like one. The shop. The shop. Who gets the shop? You believed me so quickly. He's my friend. But the shop... Listen, can you arrange a room nearby? I can. But why? Why else? I didn't come at this hour to share just a beer with you. He dosed the beer with something. Then? Try to understand. Manu... I think you're drunk... So take advantage of it. Manu. Search on Google. "Room near me for 2-3 hours." 2-3 hours? Too less? Fine, look for 4-5 hours. No problem. Makdoom, take measurements for the casket. Aren't you 5'7? Not for me, for this guy. "Fall in love, don't fall for love." Manu, pardon me but, I'm not that kind of a guy, buddy. What type? I'm Manu you're Ranjan. Together 'Manoranjan' (Entertainment). You're going to die a widower. Listen. 'Manoranjan.' Well, Manu, in our family fun begins only after marriage. I can't marry you for a couple of hours. That's not what I meant. But... Let me drop you home. Come on. Go on, brother. Leave her. You're handsome. You can find others. What kind of a guy are you? A girl is making you an offer, but you can't take a hint. Have you never done it before? Whatever you say. You can finish the beer if you want to, then I'll drop you home. Sit. - Huh? - Sit. You're a tough nut. You didn't melt at all. What? I was testing you. You turned out to be a great guy. Manu, we middle-class boys, never do anything to spoil our reputation, nor do we take advantage of anyone's helplessness. "You're mine, and I'm yours," "there's nothing to hide." "I am so overwhelmed..." "I am so overwhelmed by you," "there's nothing left of me in me." "I am so overwhelmed by you," "there's nothing left of me in me." "My love for you isn't unreasonable." "I am crazy about you, says the world." "We've been together for ages." "You're like the fresh breeze of wind for me." - "Without you my day begins in one place," - Is she my sister-in-law? "and ends in another." "You're mine, and I'm yours," "there's nothing to hide." "I am so overwhelmed..." She's clapping on Sita's kidnapping. - "I am so overwhelmed by you," - Sit down. "I'm no longer what I used to be." - Why are you doing this? - What did I do? Missing me. I can't stop getting hiccups since morning. I can't rehearse. - I am working. - Working, is it? I thought you must be missing me. Anyway. Maybe someone else is missing me. I'll call them. Okay, bye. Wait a minute. I was thinking about you. Bring Manu's proposal to my family. And turn our love marriage into an arranged marriage. Okay. Look priest, we came over only because you insisted. Otherwise, this is against our rules. She is a very nice girl, come along. He's staring pretty hard. Looks weird. Poor man is blind. We've already asked our questions. In case you want to tell us something, or add something... I would like to continue my job even after the wedding. I specifically told you this, priest. Our daughter-in-laws don't go out to work. Your son doesn't work either. But there's nothing wrong with it. Let her continue until Ranjan doesn't find a job. When she earns 60,000 a month, you'll earn respect and rewards. - He does have a point. - Yes, brother. What does she do? She's a sales executive in the little umbrella factory. Little umbrella? Little umbrella? Will you give free umbrellas to the family, or will you charge us as well? You have our confirmation. Now let's fix a wedding date. Okay, fine. Congratulations. "I'm like a parched piece of land," "you're the monsoon." "My drifting heart keeps humming your tunes." "Shall I give you my life, or my heart?" "Or win your heart," "and forsake the world for you." "Without you my day begins in one place," "and ends in another." "You're mine, and I'm yours," Have you told your family, that I work in a condom company? I'll tell them in a couple of days. Promise. "I am so overwhelmed by you," Let's drink your favourite beer. "there's nothing left of me in me." - Shall we? - Yes. "I am so overwhelmed by you," "there's nothing left of me in me." Manokamna. Come here. Come, come. Come on. Sit here. Come. Sit. Sit. You didn't sleep all night, did you? Sister-in-law. Will you give us the good news this year? That's the problem with our country, be it marriage or the new government. Everyone wants good news in the first year. You're right. You're absolutely right. I ruined my life and my figure by having a baby in my first year. That's the difference between love marriage and arranged marriage. You know, Mr. Gupta. His daughter... She had a love marriage. She posts so many pictures on Facebook. God, I can't begin to tell you. They are always going to Manali or Nainital... Recently she went to Goa I guess. God... You never went out after marriage? I did. I went out twice. I see. When? During my two pregnancies. Trip to the labour room. Where else do you think I'll go? Father, are you enjoying it? Yes. - What is this, son? - Manchow soup. Manchaho soup. Daughter-in-law's presence has brighten the house. Grandpa, now your knee pain will be gone. You can use the western toilet from now on. "Found 100 rupees from beloved's pocket." - "I want to spend all of it." - Manu. "I want to spend all of it." "Off I go..." "Off I go to the market." "Off I go..." "Off I go to the market." "Found 100 rupees from beloved's pocket." "I want to spend all of it." - "Off I go... Off I go to the market." - Dad, I brought the AC. "Off I go..." "Off I go to the market." "Anklet for my mother-in-law," "ring for my sister-in-law." "Bindi for my husband's cute sister." "Take my brother-in-law out for shopping." "I want to spend all of it." "Off I go..." "Off I go to the market." "Off I go..." "Off I go to the market." This beer is really tasty. I love it. Drink some more. Drink some more. It's made from barley. This beer is made from barley? And our wives only made bread for us from barley. Yeah, right. Leave all that, brother, and listen to me. I've to tell you something important. The 'umbrella' in Little Umbrella, Yes. Is not an umbrella. It's a condom. Silly boy, joking with coward husbands. He's naughty. He's naughty. No. Manu sells condoms. Write it down. 5 kilos ghee, wooden slips, sandalwood, one earthen pot, and people to cry at the funeral. - What is this list? - It's for our funeral. - Make it two, brother. - Why? They will kill me too. You don't know our father too well. He will bury all of us in the same grave. Wait a minute. Here's the money for your beer. Let's go. Get up. You also had cashew nuts. I see.. now you're keeping tabs on your older brother. Since you're paying. Pay in full. Let's go. Come on. - Hear me out, brother. - Who are you? - Who are you? - What are you doing here? - Why? - Hear me out, please. - Balls. - Brother. Which doctor did you bring me to? He checked my eye once, but made me open my mouth six times. This is the best hospital in MP, father. Best hospital. - Sit, grandpa. - I did. Today we got only one order. Thank God the company is safe now. Let's go. - Shall we go? - Yes. Let's go home. Son, follow that girl. Everybody knows. How can you say such things at your age, papa? That sounds so disgusting. - Let's go home. - She's my daughter-in-law. - Where? - Follow her. Why follow daughter-in-law? - We can meet her at home in the evening - He's right. We can meet her at home in the evening Who is that guy she is riding with? Drive. I said drive. That's not Manu, father. What's the concern, Manu? Who is that guy? I've seen him before. Let me see. Uncle, your eyes are not yet operated. Drive faster. It's a new car, father. Daughter-in-law is new too. It was your idea, Manu. Take a left. Left. I said left! This way. Papa. Papa. Listen. She is not Manu. Wait a minute. First order two cartons as sample. - I've signed all the papers. - Manu... Dad. Dad. Dad, you can't enter in anybody's office without appointment. You too, Mr. Santosh, and... We will ask somebody. Even this is okay. Do this first. I've checked this. Tell sir this is okay. Get it done today. Okay. Inform sir. Manu, what are you doing here? Same thing I do every day. Well... I work here every day. Ohh... you came to give me a surprise. Great. Give me five. Listen, you gave me a surprise. I am surprised. Now leave. Devi, are you drunk in the morning again? How will you move forward in life like this? I don't want to move forward anyway, I am thinking about the back. - Why are you thinking... - Yes. When presented with an opportunity, people should look back. You'll find your family standing there. And I've decided I'll only look back in life. Think about my past. Move backwards. What nonsense. Haven't you heard that English proverb... For every successful girl, there is her family behind her. What rubbish is this? - Manu. - Sir. Why didn't you tell me your family's coming over today? My family? - Which family.. So... did you know about daughter-in-law's job? - Speak up! - Dad, I had a clue. Well, I knew... Actually, I knew about it. You... You knew. Leave it, papa. Papa, leave it. Leave it. Brother-in-law. Leave it. What are you doing? He's married now. - Control. Control. - Papa. - Calm down. - Please... Brother. If only you had clobbered him with the slippers earlier, we wouldn't be humiliated like this. How could he? I just bought them yesterday. You and your wife have given... a bad name to the entire family. Sorry. Elections are around the corner. If the neighbours find out, I'll be ruined. Uncle, are you serious. Here. You'll be humiliated if your neighbours find out. You should be tensed about it. Take all the tension needed. Because I've heard everything clearly. Now I'll tell everyone about it. Bunty. Slap him. Stop him. Stop him. Papa, that Laata's son is such a scoundrel, he tells his own family's secrets to the neighbours. I warned them, grandpa, to check her background before giving approval. How weird it will seem, when our neighbours come asking for this, instead of sugar or tea. Sister-in-law, can I borrow a pack of condoms? I'll return it tomorrow. Yes, of course. Dotted or normal? Anything works. - Be right back. - Yes. Sister-in-law, do you have Kala-khatta flavour? No, we're all out of it. How about mango? No, he's allergic to mangoes. Then I'll get strawberries, wait here. Okay. Now listen to me carefully. We won't allow a daughter-in-law in this house... who works in a condom factory. You guys have a problem with my job. Then I will leave this job. Okay, good. She's pretty mature. End of problem. Arrange for dinner. Make fried buns today. Cheers. I messed up. - Forgive me. - Messed up? If you had told your family about my job on time, then it would've never come to this. I've a question... you were driving the car, weren't you? - Yes. - If you were at the wheels, you could have turned the car in any direction. Or just crashed it. How could I crash it? It's your new car. And people always blame others. You guys make condoms worth millions, but can't install a simple doorbell. So when the outsider rings the bell, the insiders know there's an outsider outside, who wants to come inside. But no. Anyone can come in as they please, like it's some sort of temple. There's no doorbell in our home either. Do we manufacture condoms here? Good. I am sorry too. I never said sorry. You can say so many things, but can't say sorry. Fine, don't say it. Doesn't matter. Manu... we'll think of something. We will find a solution. Cheers. She's educated. Allow her to do a job. - Father, I was saying... - What were you saying? What's the point of letting our daughter-in-law work? No one in this family makes a decent earning. When will my eyes get operated on? As soon as I win the elections. Which is never? Papa, you had a problem with Manu's previous job, and she quit when you urged her. You shouldn't have a problem with her new job. She's only selling boxes. Three is always better than two. Which two? - Hemant and me. - You call that a job. You make lesser than a beggar. Stop boasting about your job. - Please, sit. - Allow Manu to do her job. Well... Fine, if you all insist, then... But, don't harm the family name! Now you will get commission on every pack. - Okay. It has a good margin. - Let me explain the job to you. - Okay. These are Tupperware boxes. They come with one year guarantee. It's good quality. It keeps food warm for a long time, and doesn't go cold. And they are unbreakable. They don't break easily. So if we ever get in a fight, can we hurl it at our husband? You've other kitchen equipment at home for that. - Like a rolling pin. - Yes... Child... Why don't you let her train under you? She will learn the job and also make some money. Aunty, I... She is like your sister. Isn't she? Don't just stand there. Take her bag. Hurry up. These are Tupperware boxes. It's good quality. You can scratch it all you like, but it won't get dented. And they don't break easily. They are unbreakable. And if you buy them now, we're having a special offer. Up to 50% discount. Sister, can I leave early today? Yes, you may. No problem. Thank you, sister. Shall we? Whose bike is this? Borrowed it from a friend to take you out. Sit. Long live, Keval Prajapati. Orchha's candidate for the minister's position. I've a question. Your family has no money. So who is paying for the promotions? That MLA Kashi Tiwari, he's sponsoring the promotions. Politics. I'm confused about who benefits from whom. Shall we? Hmm. Hema. Haven't seen Puja for a couple of days? - Where is she? - You don't know, sister. What? The village council will announce the verdict on her today. Announce her verdict? I had already warned you. This social media and mobile.. ..have spoiled our youth. And this girl has defamed our village. Our image is maligned in the neighbouring villages My daughter's life is ruined. She is pregnant. Who will marry her now? Did your daughter take my permission, before falling in love with my son? We'll pay for the treatment, and some compensation as well. Why don't you pay some extra money and buy her, and do as you please? Hey girl, who are you? Odd. You're calling me a girl, and also asking who I am. I am a girl, that's all you need to know. Don't interfere, girl. This is now the village council's matter. This isn't the village council's case, it concerns every girl in this country. And instead of helping her, you're sending her for an abortion. And what's her fault? Her parents didn't raise her properly? The problem is that none of you advised them to use a condom. How can you say such obscene things being a woman? Is she from your family? Please, sister. No, Puja. You both made a mistake, why should you get an abortion alone, he should get castrated too. Castrated? What is she saying, chief? You know what, let her decide your fate. - Let's go. - Please, sister. Please go away! Sushila. Wait, wait, mister. Here. Take it. Sushila. Sushila. Where were you two? I've been trying to call you for so long? Where is Puja? She hasn't shown up to work either. Where are you going? I... Tell me what happened, Sushila. Tell me what's wrong? If we had listened to you the other day, then Puja would still be alive. What? I tried stopping her. I did... But she aborted the child without telling me. The infection spread throughout her body. Puja is no longer with us, child. Ranjan. Ranjan, wake up. Do you know how many abortions happen in our country alone? I don't know. Ranjan, wake up. Get up and see this. Dozens of girls lose their life because of those abortions. Don't know. Get up, Ranjan. We should do something. Manu, do you know that every 12 minutes someone dies of poverty in our country. But we cannot sell our home to eradicate the country's poverty. Get some sleep. What's the matter? You're up early today. Actually, I woke up too late. Listen, Ranjan, I'm joining my old job again. What? What are you saying, Manu? What's the problem with your new job selling boxes? That's just a job, and this is a responsibility that I want to undertake. But how could you make such a big decision... Manu, you cannot do this job. You could've asked me once. I kept asking up until last night. Now I'm telling you. Manu, what nonsense is this? Finally, my family has given approval for your job, but you're going back to that 'umbrella'. I must have a reason for doing this job. You don't, you're just being stubborn. Your ego is so blown up, that my family feels inferior to it. I asked you politely, requested and begged you, but you always did as you please. And you just say what your family wants you to say. Manu, if you set foot out of this room, then... I won't eat a morsel of food. You won't anyway. Since you're fasting. Manu, listen to me. I am forced to do that, you do understand. Manu... Finish your yoga, grandpa. Manu... Okay fine. I won't take a stand for you after this. You never took a stand for anything. Not even for our love marriage, that's why we had to plan this arranged marriage. - Grandpa. - Leave it. Ranjan. Yes, papa? Come here. Yes, papa. Yes, papa? You and Manokamna had a love marriage? Says who? What was she saying? You heard everything. Wow... such a big thing, and you kept us in the dark. I didn't keep anyone in the dark. It's in the light now. You all know now. But you didn't tell us about it. If I had told you, you wouldn't have carried me to the wedding altar. No. - Where are my slippers? - I'll go get them. - Vijay. - Ranjan. - Brother. - Stop. Stop. What... You told me about the condom factory, why didn't you tell me about the love marriage? Would you have done anything if I had told you? - No. - That's why I didn't tell you. - You... - Papa. - Please, manage. - Papa, I caught him. Papa. What else did you hide from me? Tell me now. Manu is slightly older than me. Daughter-in-law is older? Is she older than her? Not as old as her. Only two-years. And? And we sometimes drink beer together. Strong? Yes. - Do you drink too? - Light. This is so embarrassing! First the packets, now beer. I wonder what other secrets are waiting to be exposed. Keep quiet. Tea. Only tea, brother. Where did daughter-in-law go? There. Where? Her... old job. Hey... where's the midget? There. - Sir... - Sir, listen. Sir... Sir, I'm leaving this job. - I see... - Yes. Good luck. By the way, what's the occasion? It's a rubbish job, sir. Utter rubbish. I'm not complaining about the money, but reputation is important as well. My neighbours keep asking Devi what is that you do. What am I going to tell them? Tell them you work in a condom company. So that I never get married! You know what, escort him respectfully out of the door, all the way to the temple on the other side of the road. - Okay. - Let's go. Sir, Manu! Manu? Manu. What brings you here? Manu, what brings you here? I already asked her that, sir. You ask the next question. Manu... What brings you here? Sir, I'm re-joining my job again. What? Say that again. I'll be working in this company. God bless you. Did you guys hear? She's back. Says she wants to join back. God bless you. God bless you. - Manu, this is your best decision. - Okay, fine. This is what I was talking about, sir. A man should always do the work that gets him respect. And no other job is as respectable as this one, sir. - Fine. - Sir, this is the best job. - Take him inside. - I swear I will never leave. - I know. - I will never leave. You won't budge till you've breathed your last. Manu, your table's waiting for you. No, sir. First I want to share something important with everyone. Every year more than 15 million abortions are carried out in India. Maybe you don't know, but females go through a lot of discomfort after an abortion. Vomiting, diarrhoea. Fever. Heavy bleeding. Damage to the uterus. Conceiving again can be a problem. It's not just the physical aspect, but an abortion shatters a woman mentally and emotionally as well. Millions of girls die due to illegal abortions. What confuses me is, people spend a fortune on abortions, but can't buy a condom for 10 rupees. Let's assume that illiterate people know little about condoms. But how can educated people be so careless? So... what should we do? Awareness, sir. We need to bring awareness in women. The truth is, men, don't face any problems, whether they use a condom or not. It's the women who have to suffer. So we must spread awareness among women. Women should take the first step. Women should demand the use of condoms. We're from Little Umbrella company. I wanted to tell you that condoms are important. And, we must tell other women... Listen. What rubbish is this? - We don't want to listen to you. - Let's go. We're from good families, understand. Listen. Please hear me out. Look at the handwriting. Its so beautiful. I am angry. I don't understand why they called us. Even I don't know. I had heard about condom shop. - What happened? But condom residence? - What happened? - Condom Residence. Who wrote this? Must be one of the guys who heard the truth. Did they change their surname? From Prajapati Residence to Condom Residence. This is great. We'll come to get condoms from them. No need to go to the pharmacy for buying condoms. - Naughty. Naughty. - Condom Residence. Why didn't you tell us earlier, that your daughter does this type of work? What type, mister? It's that... Father, you tell them. What can I say? - Can I say it? - Say some tea. Even we have some ideals. Get some tea with less water. Babli, make some tea. Take my daughter, for example, she never gives my son-in-law a chance to complain. And your daughter... She never did anything right. Now, we are defamed in the society. It's written 'Condom Residence' outside the house. It's difficult to step out of the house. Sorry, sir. Manu. - Sit, mom. - No. Sit. Look, mister, no one in our family buys or sells these things. We don't want a daughter-in-law with a job like this. Just take your daughter back. We won't take her back like this. We gave our daughter to you. If you want to send her back, then let's invite all the relatives again. Let there be a celebration. You leave her back just the way you took her. Print cards. Papa, you had a problem with my job, and I quit. But back then it was just a job, now it's become my responsibility. Since I realised that my job can save several lives... I don't want to hear anything. You are my daughter-in-law, and this job is wrong in my point of view. Wrong? You simply decided that it's wrong. Fine. When you can prove my job is wrong, I will quit again. Are you going to say anything, mister? I asked for some tea. That hasn't arrived yet. Where's the tea? The entire family's alike. You are taking it too seriously... What else do you expect? Okay, fine. Good. Child, you must quit this job, okay. - What? - It's okay. Papa, call me once you get home. Manu... Don't be so rigid. Whoever took my luggage out, please don't do it again! Takes four hours to put everything back in place. Manu... Manu, what are you doing? What, Ranjan? Did you imagine even once before taking my stuff out of the closet, that you're planning to throw your wife out of the house. - Papa... - Again you didn't take a stand for me. In your effort to be a good son, you didn't realise that you're a husband as well. For the first time, I regret marrying you. I should have known, a person who can't take a stand for himself, will never stand up for his wife. "If you cannot be true to love," "Then return my heart." "I don't want to regret falling in love," "I don't want to regret falling in love," "Please return my heart." "I don't want to live with your memories." "Return my heart." When I said I don't want to do it, I don't want to do it. I already said no. Why do you keep calling me up? I've quit your group. Be it Mahabharata or Ramleela, I don't want to do it. "The path of love is full of obstacles." "I don't need anything else, if I have you by my side." "You won't find anyone else like me." "The bond we share is real, don't break it." "It was my duty to reason it out with you," "It was my duty to reason it out with you," "Please return my heart." "I don't want to live with your memories." "Return my heart." and get the husband and wife's signatures. And you will be divorced. Here. Get her signatures on it. "The love that we share," "I don't want it to be transient." "You are in me and I am in you," "That is how the world should see us." "I am scared of love, my dear," This is Ranjan. Is Manu in the office? She has already left, son. "Mend my broken heart," Stop here. - What? Why? - Drop me here. But why? What happened? - "And I will bow down to worship love." - Drop me here. "If you cannot love me from the bottom of your heart," "If you cannot love me from the bottom of your heart," "Please return my heart." - "I don't want to live with your memories." - Is Manu with you? - No. "Return my heart." The number you've dialed is currently not reachable. Ticket! Ticket! Ticket! That man has bought your ticket. That man. Here's your money. From now on I will buy my own ticket. You don't have to do this anymore. From now on? I admit I don't make much money, doesn't mean I can't afford a bus ticket for you. You are my wife. - Your wife? - Yes. Then why are you divorcing me? Manu, wait. Manu. - You're still stuck on that. - Stuck on what? Do you even remember what we fought about? Your ego, what else? What ego? I had the same job before marriage. You didn't have a problem then. And I quit that job when your family had a problem with it. Yes, then why did you have to do that job again? I had a valid reason, that's why I joined back. Did you try to find out what that reason was? But Manu, did you try to understand, how your job will affect my father's position in the elections? His reputation in society? Are you telling me he'll lose his reputation... because I work in a condom company? Would your father have stopped you if you were doing this job? He wouldn't, Ranjan. Because your family has a problem... with their daughter-in-law working in a condom company. Because a woman doing this job isn't acceptable to anyone! Stop the bus, mister. Why stop now? Our stop hasn't arrived. Keep going. - Stop the bus here, I want to get off. - What happened? Stop the bus. But we haven't finished talking yet, and our bus stop hasn't arrived yet. - We're done talking. - Keep driving. - I said stop the bus. - Keep driving. Stop it you two! I mean get another bus. A married man is like an underwear. Stuck between two legs. One for family and the other for the wife. But in our case, both the legs are your fathers. I know. I am his underwear after all. And doesn't matter how many holes an underwear has, it still protects your reputation. Manu, every son's duty is to protect his father's reputation. Please, quit that job. Do you know how many abortions are done daily in India? I don't know, and I've nothing to do with them. What about the abortions in your family... Why my family... What? Sister-in-law Babli had two abortions, Ranjan. With complications. She managed to survive, but Puja... She lost her life due to these complications. Sorry, Manu. You do what you feel is right. You have my support. Promise. But your family. They want you to divorce me. They want many things. But I won't do it. Means? Meaning... Manu and Ranjan, Will now together have some Manoranjan (Fun). I am very confused. Don't worry, everything will be fine. Grandpa. What are you blabbering in your sleeping? - I didn't eat the curry. - Over here, grandpa. Where are the children? Grandpa, come here. I will show you my house. What's going on? Where did you get these? From Manu aunty's room. Ranjan! Ranjan! Yes, papa. Where are you? - Over here. - Busy shitting. Leave! Get out of here. - Come out. - I just got here, papa. Please control. I said come out. Go on. Did you two sign the papers? Papers? Divorce papers? Get the papers signed today. Will do. Sign these papers, Manu! I cannot sign. What good is your education, when you can't even sign? My father is my God! His decision is the final word! Even if they are wrong. Sign these papers, Manu! So why do you want a divorce? They don't want to live together. Why not? There are about a million reasons. Name any 10. There is a reason, sir. She always replies to my I love you with a thank you. Washes my clothes with dishwashing soap. Does the same steps for every song. Whenever I'm talking to her, she always looks somewhere else. She never looks at me. I don't know why she doesn't. Cleans my laptop and mobiles with water. Keeps checking my mobile passwords. When in the kitchen, she scratches her back with the rolling pin. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. And you, Manokamna? Never covers his mouth while sneezing. Snips his nails on Tuesdays and hair on Thursdays. Wears the same underwear inside out. Sleeps all day and stays awake at night. Doesn't do a thing. He has no savings. Splurges all his money. And doesn't lock the door when going to the washroom. All that is fine, but you must have a valid reason to get a divorce. Let me tell you, your honour. Her conduct isn't proper. What do you mean her conduct isn't proper? Does she limp when she walks? This isn't right what you're accusing Manu of. She is your daughter-in-law too. Manu has a good character. Why does she sell condoms? She just sells condoms, she doesn't sell cigarettes or tobacco. Stop you two. Calm down. Why didn't you tell me that she sells condoms? We were going to tell you. When? After we've lost the case? These things don't remain a secret for too long. - It's in the light now. - No, wait. Why didn't you tell me this earlier, that is my objection. We're talking about condoms. Stop! Stop! What is your problem with Manokamna selling condoms? If your daughter was selling condoms, how would you feel? See, made him cough. It's just a cough. Either you settle your differences in six months, or else if they can't reach a compromise. Then divorce. Six months? - That's too long. - Lawyer. Say something. Babli. Bablu. What happened? Babbu... I'm in a naughty mood tonight. Can I eat some sugar? Get it alone. I'm not in the mood. After a long time we got some privacy. Tell me... shall we eat some sugar. Let's stay up tonight. You need to wake up before staying up all night. You know. I already had two abortions. You haven't realised yet, how important condoms are? This is what Manu was trying to make us realise. I cannot take any more risks. You want to stay up all night, don't you? Yes. Then go get some protection. Who is it? Grandpa, it's me Hemant. Come here. Yes. Where were you going at this hour? I'm having indigestion. I was going to get some antacid. Get one for me too while you're at it. One antacid, please. And another thing. What was it? What was it? Wait a second. I'm getting a call. Hello. Yeah... What? Are you seriously going to make me do this? I can't buy condoms for you. Fine, I'll get one for you. Last time. Never again. Never again. Yes. This is for your friend. Little Umbrella. Little Umbrella. From our family only. What? Nothing. Is he dead? Grandpa, why did you turn off the lights? I always turn off the lights at night before going to bed. Here's your antacid. - Did you get it? - Yes. Good. Come on. Bablu, I'm back. Hey. Do you know which one I got? Which one? Manu's company. - I see... - Little Umbrella. Grandpa. Who is it? What happened? Where is my glass? Grandpa, that antacid had expired. No wonder there were no bubbles. I'll get a new one for you. Hurry up. The situation is pretty dire. Grandpa, if you were at the border, you could've killed the enemies like this only. Sister, what are you doing? You're married and eyeing at somebody else? Don't cheat on your husband. Never let this thought cross your mind, Babli, that I will ever cheat on my husband. He's so naive... So naive that he hangs his underwear under his shirt to dry. And you think I'll cheat on him. I am loyal. Completely loyal to him. While kissing on the lips, his moustache pricks me. But I never said a word. It's called a smooch, what's kissing on the lips? Why? Don't you know I studied in Hindi medium? But all your actions are that of an English medium school. Well, I was just checking, whether this magnet can still draw metal towards her? Has his metal turned into plastic? Hasn't turned into plastic, but it's definitely rusted. If my veil slips while working, he doesn't ask about my blouse. He asks about the safety pin. Last night I kept my leg on his. I asked how does it feel. Do you know what he said? Feels heavy. Imagine, heavy. Do I look heavy? He finds me heavy. - Long live... - Brother Keval! - Long live... - Brother Keval! - Long live... - Brother Keval! - Long live... - Brother Keval! Vote for brother Keval this time." - One, two, three, four... - Vote for brother Keval this time." - Hello. Hello. Hello. - Long live... Brother Keval! Brother. Sit, please. Hello. Hello. Hello. What is all this? Did you call me here to honour me, or to humiliate me? I forgot all about the garland. Hey... get the garland! It's all sponsored by Little Umbrella condom company. They sponsored tea, snacks, stage, chairs, mic, everything. In fact, they even gave me these packets. Of snacks? I brought a few extra packs for you. Are two packs not enough? His wife is no more. He's a widower? Mister. Mister. - Action! - Clap. When you're in the mood to make love, first, think of protection. Little Umbrella, It's good it's safe. - Cut. Cut. - Sir, that sounds more like a threat. - Devi, wait. - He's right. Manu. - Hey. Please, excuse me. - Lunch. Ranjan, you? Cut. Cut. - I'll be right back. - Go on. Sir, she isn't doing it properly at all. If you don't have a problem, can I talk to her once? Please, please. Manu will explain to her. Just a minute. The way you're speaking your dialogues, what we want isn't coming across. I mean if you can say everything with a little more responsibly... Responsibly? You do it. Me? Little Umbrella Condoms. For some extra fun. Chocolate flavour. Extra dotted, double pleasure. Night of desire, fun, pleasure... This is why we're a country of 1.4 billion people. It's wrong. No one talks about safety. Condoms are right, so they should be sold the right way. So whenever you're in the mood for some fun, priority should be protection. Little Umbrella. It's good, it's safe. What are you all watching? Will someone tell me? Are you going to stare at my face or say something? - Tell him. - God... disgusting... Did you guys watch sister-in-law Manu's new ad? - No, we didn't. - I didn't either. All the neighbours saw it. After watching this, soon we'll be called, the condom street. And who's going to write that? I will. Mr. Bunty, Lata's son. Bloody idiot.. Hold him. Hold him. Shameless boy... You need to be explained the importance of condoms. To your daughters, your daughters-in-law, and to the women around you! You must take the first step. You must demand it, and use it. Manu... Sushila? I want to lend my support to this good cause. I lost my daughter. I don't want anyone else to lose their daughters too. Every woman will carry precaution with them. Because our protection is in our hands. Whether you use Little Umbrella Condoms, or any other company. Children make mistakes, but children aren't mistakes. Children are meant to be cajoled, not to be aborted. How long will we depend on men? We must live with protection. No protection, no sex. Most men don't want to use it. And whether they use it or not, they don't have to suffer. It's the woman who has to suffer. Every woman must take initiative. Every woman must demand it. And each woman must use it. Because it's necessary for men, but a necessity for women. Manu, we want to support you in your cause. Shall I take Manu on my bike? You take your bike, I'm taking Manu in a taxi. - I can... - Hello, madam. Hello. - Who is he? - I am Pappan Khare. From Madhya Pradesh Jagat Samachar news channel. What channel? Sir, Madhya Pradesh Jagat Samachar news channel. Okay. What brings you here? Madam has been making headlines these days. So I thought I need a live interview from madam, on the 'Little Umbrella' matter. - Go ahead. - No, no, no... Isn't it? - Do it. - No. It's a small one. Won't take long. I cannot give any interviews. - Come on. - It won't be a problem. We'll come back soon, Come back tomorrow. Manu... this will be fun. I cannot give an interview. Madam, hear me out. Madam, people feel you're making profits, using this social cause as an agenda. - What... - So let's clear the air. Mister... behave yourself. I am only asking questions. When I'm done with you, you'll be in no condition to ask questions. Mind your tongue. Where's your behaviour? Is this the way to talk to a lady? - This is no way to talk to you. - Let's go. Madam... If you want to refuse to give the interview, then say it yourself. Why did you hire this man to say no? - Hello. What did you say? - Hold this, will you? Get lost before I break your skull with my shoe, - Devi. - Stop. Wait Sir. - Do I go to your office and complain about you? Wait. You want my interview, don't you? - Yes. - Let's go inside. - Let's do the interview. - Inside? Why inside? This is a social cause, isn't it? Then let's do this interview in front of the people. Come on. Madam, my first question. Condoms are for protection and not pleasure. Did you use this line to increase your sales? Our customers have increased our sales, I only showed them the right use of a condom. Okay, fine. They say "two birds with one stone". So if condoms can give you safety and pleasure, there's nothing wrong with it. Helmet, mask, seatbelt, gloves, and l-guards are not worn for pleasure. It's for protection. And you think your commercial will teach... our men to exercise more precaution. I can't vouch for men, but I'll ensure that every woman uses precautions. Every woman will buy condoms and also use them. I could have spoken extensively on pregnancy, population, and abortion. And I wanted to. But you seem to me like one of those journalists, who creates news for his audience. Every news reporter's job is not just to ask questions, but also giving answers. What was your name again? Pappan Khare. You look like Pappan to me, but you don't look Khare (honest) from any angle. Today's debate is over the campaign started... by Manokamna Tripathi of Chanderi, where she not only encouraged women to carry condoms, but the other companies... Who sold their condoms as an object of pleasure, has questioned them too. Is this a conspiracy by Manokamna Tripathi, to increase sales of Little Umbrella? Or does she really want to bring about a change in ideologies? Manokamna Tripathi's campaign has created a stir. Which has made it a hot topic in the Parliament too. Manokamna Tripathi's campaign has knocked on the doors of change. The campaign started by Manokamna Tripathi of Chanderi, has affected the entire country and not just Madhya Pradesh alone. This campaign has put pressure on several condom companies, And their sales has dropped too. Manokamna Tripathi's commercial has shattered, the marketing strategies used by several condom companies for years. She's not only seen promoting protection in this commercial, in fact, by spreading awareness among women, she has also challenged the orthodox beliefs of society. What do you think? Is he going to win? Looking at the current image of our family, forget the elections. No one will even offer us a chair. I wonder when the results will be declared and when we'll get to eat. I wish I knew, then I would've eaten to my fill at night. I am so famished, I swear. I wouldn't mind taking abuses either. Uncle. Lost it. Lost? Who's it? Now my eyes will never get operated on. What did I say? Hello. What? I won. - He won. - Are you joking? - Are you sure? - I'll go eat. Not now. Come here. Okay, fine. I'll call back later. - I won. I won. - Bless me. What were you saying? I said I lost the game of cards. Beat him! We won! We won! You won, uncle. Anoint him quickly. - Anoint him. - Yes. God bless you. God bless you. Congratulations. - My uncle. - I won in the end. We've won. We've won. The band's here. Long live. No, no, please. What are you doing? Get me down. Make way, my daughter is here. - Come to me, my dear. - Dad. Come. Sit. No one has ever won with such a enormous difference? Let's have a huge round of applause. Only Sunny Leone got these many votes from Orcha, when she entered Bigg Boss. Who is Sunny Leone? She... she... she's a leader in a different sector. I see. He's enjoying this space, because of his daughter-in-law. So, your daughter-in-law shold get the entire credit. I would like to request your daughter-in-law Manokamna Prajapati, to come on stage, so you can honour her. Sure. Please, go on. Brother. Brother. Brother. Brother. - Keval. - Brother. Keval, what's wrong? - Tell us something. - Brother. You left in such a hurry. What happened, brother? What's wrong? Help me sit down. Sister, sit. Chhoti, come and sit. Congratulations. Congratulations, mister. Congratulations, grandpa... It's me, Nyayadish. Brother. As you said, had to grease palms to speed things up. The hearing is tomorrow. Sign here, and they will get divorced tomorrow. Sign here. Yes, please. No, papa. What? Sign it. No. Your ego's grown so big, that this family and relationships look too small. Your reputation, your election, your ideologies. Your kin means nothing. I thought if Manu lends support to your elections, you'll give her the respect she deserves. But no. You cannot accept that you won... because of your daughter-in-law and not your abilities. Sign it. Manu can decide where she wants to work and when. She's that educated and mature. You and I are no one to deprive her of that right. There's another thing I hid from you, papa. I've been aiding Manu all this time. I thought I'll change your orthodox ways with time, but no. I didn't realise while trying to be your son, I forgot I'm someone's husband. I won't sign it, papa. Nor will there be any divorce. Hari Om. Tell this husband to take his wife and get lost! Get out! Ranjan, wait. Manu. Manu. Manu, wait. What happened? - Minal. - What happened? - What happened? - Someone call the doctor. The car... Where is the car? Get the car. Papa, everything will be fine. Everything will be alright. How is Minal's condition now, aunty? She is still inside. What is he doing here? - I called him. - Did you ask me? Tell him to take his wife and leave. I don't want them around Minal's child. That's all. Mr. Girish. Girish... Girish is my son-in-law. I warned you about this situation. What happened? During his wife's first delivery, I told him that his wife's womb is not strong. - Womb? - Her uterus is weak. Her first pregnancy had many complications. And second pregnancy was not advisable at all. Especially after two miscarriages. But he didn't listen to me. And now, the mother and child's life is in danger. Is he right? You knew about all the complications, yet you took a risk with your wife's life. You already had a child. Father... father... If anything happens to my daughter, I will bury you alive! If you knew there was a possibility, she could lose her life, then why did you have to get her pregnant again? Why couldn't you use protection? This is what Manokamna was trying to explain. Now when your daughter's life is at risk, you're threatening your son-in-law. Wow! Otherwise, you've always been pointing fingers at Manokamna. Although you've eyes.. ..you can't see.. ..the right and wrong. No need to operate my eyes. I'm fine the way I'm. This happens with few people. No need to worry. She is out of danger now. Both the mother and baby are safe. My daughter is alright? - Yes. - Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Bless you. How can they throw you out of the house? You did not commit any sin. Pardon me, Manu, but I blame Ranjan for all this. If you hadn't married him and moved into his house, - you wouldn't be seeing this day. - Devi? That's rubbish. I am supporting Manu. Who am I supporting? Shakira? Don't talk rubbish. Shut up you two. Ranjan. Huh? Which place is this? Bless you. We're a family of 16, but my ego, arrogance, and rigidity has made me lonely. My name befits my nature. I've realised that being younger or older isn't important. It's important to be right, which you are. I've realised my mistake and my responsibility. Forgive me, child. Father, I want your support, not your apology. Don't just stand there. Come here, son. Sorry. Think about it, dad. If our population was less at the time of Corona.. ..our problem would have been solved. Corona's strength was crowd. Not only Corona, unemployment.. ..poverty. Riots. All of it is powerful in crowd. That's why. We don't want to give the responsibility.. ..but take it. What do we do, Manu? We are the artists. We are acting. But you know what is right and wrong. Then how can you? This is Manokamna Tripathi. Your Nusrat Bharucha. I've a message to you. Condom is not a problem but a solution. Anybody who's against our thinking. This film is for them. No doubt, this is the end of the film. But I expect, it's the beginning of a new thinking. Thank you. "All the ladies out there." "This one's for you.. you.." "All my women."
