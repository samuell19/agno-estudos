** [Multicom Entertainment Group jingle] * [music] [children playing] [parents yelling upstairs] [Beth] You didn't tell me you had a game this Wednesday. You usually play on Saturdays. [Tim] It's a tournament, you idiot! I called twice. Where the hell were you? [Beth] At the grocery store and the dry cleaners-- [Tim yelling] I've told you a thousand times! I got to know where you are! [Beth] I can't believe I missed your game! Who pitched? -Tim? No. Please, I said I was sorry! -[Tim] You're always sorry! [Laurie] As I was going to St. Ives, I met a man with seven wives. And every wife had seven cats. And every cat had seven kits, kits, cats. [Tim] I didn't know you were home, Sweet Pea. Hi, Daddy. Hi. Hey. [kissing] Did you paint me a picture? Yes, Sir. Oh, that's beautiful! You're getting so good, daddy may have to make you a partner. Like an artiket? Yup. Tim Williamson and Daughter, Architectural Design. Listen. I've got to get back to the office. I have a very important client who's waiting. Why don't you get yourself a treat. Bye bye. [kissing] * [sad piano music] [Laurie] Mommy? Mommy! Mommy!? [Beth] Hi, sweetie. Did you get to be line monitor again today? I hate when you and daddy fight! I know, honey. Me too. But grownups fight sometimes. It just happens. I'm sorry. You know, Daddy loves us very much and so he works very hard, and he gets tired. You understand? Okay. We're going to Grandma's so why don't you go change your clothes. * [sad piano music] Your sister's bringing homemade ice cream. Man, that hair stuff stinks. -Hi, Dad. -[Andrew] Beth. Andrew, see what Laurie is doing. She's coloring in front of the TV. Okay... Tim called a little while ago. He's very hurt you know. He feels you take him for granted, that you're never around when he needs you-- Why does he always tell you these things? Well maybe because I listen. He works night and day to give you the life you have. I appreciate everything he does, Alice. He says you get into these moods... I'm not the one with the moods. [Alice] When Andrew gets into a state, I just stand aside and give him a wide berth. A man needs to have some breathing room. How curly do you want this top? All right. Remind me for the thousandth time I'm just your stepmother. But I'm telling you, Beth, you've got a lot to lose. You know, I think the top should be a little bit curlier than the sides and the back. It'll give you some height. If you don't appreciate him, somebody else might. [Laurie] May I feed her, Uncle Ronnie? [Ronnie] Sure, Laurie. [Terri] Just don't give her too much. Okay? So who wants some more? [Laurie] May I please have some more, Aunt Terri? [Beth] That's very good manners sweetie. -[Ronnie] I'll have some more hun. -[phone rings] [Beth] I'll get it. [Beth] Honey, I told you we'd be here! [Tim on phone] No. No you didn't. -Really I did. -[Tim] Really you did not. -Yes, I did. -[Tim] I want you here by 8:30 sharp. I don't think I can make it home by eight-thirty sharp. I haven't finished Alice's hair yet. [Tim] Well when are you going to be home then? -I told you, when I'm finished. -[Tim] I want you home now. No, not until I'm finished. [Beth hangs up the phone] What, he's got you on a time clock now? [Beth] I better get Alice's hair out of those rollers before-- Before what? Before eight-thirtysharp? Beth, you keep doing the same thing expecting different results. Look, Terri, I know Tim has his faults, but he has a lot of good qualities-- Buried someplace very, very deep no doubt. My God, Beth, how can you defend a man who hits you? Once. It happened once, Terri. This is me you're talking to. You expect me to believe that? You have to think about Laurie! Oh god, I do think about her. [sighs] This is her father we're talking about. Listen to me, Beth. You don't have to live like this. You have a choice! I can't just give up on him. I can't. * [sad piano music] [engine stops] [Beth] Tim? Tim? [Laurie] Where's Daddy? I don't know honey, maybe he went for a walk. Come on, let's get in bed. * [suspenseful piano music] [Beth gasps] Oh, God, Tim, you scared me. [Tim] I wanted to surprise you. Aw jeez, you're shaking. Oh honey please don't cry. I didn't mean to frighten you. -[crying] -shh -Come here. Come on. Take a look. -[Beth sniffling] Do you like them? I'm so sorry about today. The pearls come from the Sea of Japan. They look beautiful on you. You're beautiful. * [sad piano music] It'll never happen again, I swear. We've been down this road before, Tim, I can't do it anymore. I know, I know... It's not just me, it's Laurie. She's not a baby anymore. This hurts her. I'm going to get help. You've said that before. [sniffles] It's different this time. I'll do whatever it takes. You haven't heard me say that before have you? Whatever it takes! Could we go and see someone together? Absolutely. Whatever you say. I can change, Beth. I want to change. I... I have to change. I can do anything if you believe in me. I believe in you. I believe in you. I always believed in you. [crying] Shh... Honey, could you color in the other room? [Laurie] Okay. -Hi, Daddy. -[Tim] Hey, sweetpea. [Tim] Babe, the coffee pot's empty. Gee, that's a tough one. Can't dump coffee into a filter by yourself? What do you think I'm a cave man? I can make coffee. I'm happy to make coffee. -Would anybody else like some? -[Beth] Be nice. Yes, I'd love one. Not too strong. Yes, ma'am. Now will that be in a silver chalice or an antique cup? Oh, I think a pottery mug will suffice. I have to go get the cake. Do we need anything else? [Beth] Yeah, uh, Some ice cream. -[Terri] Oh I brought three kinds of ice cream. -Pistachio? -[Terri] Dad hates pistachio. -It's Tim's favorite. [Terri] So it's Dad's birthday. Do we all have to have our favorite flavor? All right. Fine. Don't bother. I'll get it. Look. It's no problem. Then don't make it one, then, Terri. [Terri] Wanna ride to the store with me Laurie? [Laurie] Okay Terri, don't worry about it. -We'll be right back. -[Laurie] Bye mommy. [door closes] You want some help... [Tim smashes glass against the wall] Now! Make me some coffee! [Beth] Tim. [Tim mocking her] "Tim has to have his pistachio ice cream. -God knows what he'll do if we don't get it." -I didn't say that Tim. -Then why the hell did she give me that dirty look?! -I don't know! What's this garbage, potato salad? -I hate potato salad. -[dish crashing] [Beth crying] No! -And what's this crap, three-bean salad huh? -[dish crashing] [Beth crying] Don't, please! You call this food! This is garbage. And I hate your disgusting congealed salads too-- Laurie made that special for her grandpa-- -Ahh! -[food smashes against wall] [Beth crying] Oh God, Tim... -See what you make me do? -[Beth crying] Now, I want you to clean this mess up. I said clean it up! You like it so much, you eat it! [Beth screams] And don't you ever bad-mouth me in front of that smart-ass bitch sister of yours again. You got it? [Beth crying] [Beth] Tim. No Tim. No Tim don't please! Tim... -Please, please-- -Aghh! [Beth screams] Don't Tim. Please don't. Please don't. No, don't please. Ahh! -[Tim screams] -[window smashes] * [scary piano music] [Tim dialing the phone] Clean up this mess. [Tim into phone] Andrew! Happy Birthday, Old Man! Listen, a little problem has just come up with a client, I'm afraid I'm going to have to bow out. I was thinking, you should really treat yourself. Go to that Italian restaurant you like so much. No, no, no, no. It's on me. Well sure I'm sure. It's your birthday. You just enjoy yourselves. Happy Birthday Pop. Bye-bye. * [scary piano music] [Tim] I want this mess cleaned up before your sister gets back. [Tim's car squeals away] [Beth cries] Okay. Can you get the door there sweety? Laurie, you go and play in the living room and you stay there until I come get you, okay? Thanks, good girl. -* [sad piano music] -[Beth crying] [Laurie] Hi, Grandma. [Alice] Hi, sugar! [Alice] What started it this time? -[Beth] Pistachio ice cream. -[Alice] What? [Beth] I asked Terri to go out and get some pistachio ice cream for Tim. The next thing-- [Alice] I will never, never understand you, Beth Williamson. [Terri] You just don't get it, do you, Alice?! [Alice] I wouldn't take sides if I were you. Aw, man... [thud] [Tim dialing] [thud] [Tim] Hi Mom, how was dinner? Why not? Beth didn't feel like it? Well, it's not her birthday. Aw, aw gee. Gee. Well listen, could I have a quick word with her? Okay, just... [Alice] Beth. Sooner or later, you're going to have to talk to him. [Beth] Not now. Alice. [Tim] What?! Aww that was an accident! Hello? [huffs] [slams down phone] [thud] [Tim dialing] Yeah, you want to put Miss North Pole on. Thanks, Mom. Beth look, honey, you've got to face the facts. I'm not the only one to blame here. You've got to take some of the responsibility. No, no, no. You come home first and then I'll see a therapist. Beth! You've got to come home now! No, you're not hanging up. No, you're not hanging up! Beth? -Beth! Aagh! -[phone slams down] [Alice] I'm not saying that you should let Tim get away with it. I'm just saying that you have to go home and lay down the law and make it stick. I'm afraid to go home, Alice. I've been afraid to go home for a long time. [Alice] Well... I must say this is a lovely birthday present for your father. Always got something to say, don't you, Alice? [Beth] I'm going to bed. Goodnight, Dad. [Andrew] Goodnight. [Terri] Goodnight, sweetie. Goodnight. [Terri] Try and get some rest. [loud knocking] [Andrew] A little late to come calling, isn't it? [Tim] Mom, Pop, I'm not going to stand here and lie to you. I lost my temper. I acted like a complete jerk. [Alice] What happened? She got into one of her moods. Nothing I do pleases her. And I'd do anything for her. She knows it! [Andrew] She says you hit her. What? She threw a bowl of potato salad at me. And I admit, I shoved her. I admit it, but-- You ever hit her and I'll break your jaw. And I'd want you to. Jeez, Pop, what do you think I am? Look. She's in bed asleep. Come back tomorrow. She should be in my bed. [Alice] Oh for heaven's sakes, Andrew. Let him in. [Tim] All I want to do is tell her that I love her. Come on, Pop. You telling me you never lost your cool? Don't be all night. Thanks. Hey, let's go. I'm not going anywhere. Oh, come on honey. Just put on your clothes, and let's go home. Just get out of here. -Beth. -Dad! I want you to get dressed, put your arm around me, put a smile on your face, and walk out of here, or so help-- Heyyy. Hey, Sweet Pea. -Go call grandpa. -No, Laurie I want you to get dressed. -We're gonna go home-- -Go on. Do it. Go on. Now! -Hey Laurie! -Go on. Now! Hurry! [Tim] Laurie! * [tense piano music] Tim-- [Beth screaming, grunting] Why do you to turn everything into a war? [Andrew] Beth?! [Door closing and locking] -[Andrew] Beth?! -* [tense music] Oh Beth... [Andrew] What's going on in there?! -[punching impact] -[Beth moans] [Andrew] Open the door! [Tim] Look at me! -[punching impact] -[Beth screams] [Andrew] Alice get the police! -[repeated punching and screaming] -[Andrew screaming from outside] -[Andrew] The room's down here. -[police radio] -[Police from outside] Police! -[knocking] You've got five seconds. -[knocking] -[Tim] I'm coming! [Police from outside] You've got five seconds and we're coming in. Get your hands up! Alright. Whatever you say. Whatever you say. This isn't what it looks like. Pop, Pop. -[Andrew] You sorry son of a bitch! -It isn't this Pop! -[Beth crying] -[Officer Lawson] It's alright ma'am. It's okay. [Alice screaming] -Mom! -[Officer Lawson] You think anything's broken? -[Beth crying] -[Tim sobbing] I, I'm so sorry. [Officer Lawson] Can you move your neck from side to side? [Beth] Yeah. [Officer Lawson] Think you can stand up? [Tim] We were just kind of talking, and things got out of hand-- way, way way out of hand. Beth, please I am so sorry. [Officer Lawson] Let's go. Outside. I will spend the rest of my life making up for this, I swear. [Officer Lawson] You won't get the chance. You do want to press charges, Ma'am? Oh yeah. Beth! All I ever wanted to do was love you. Don't them do this to me. Beth. Beth! -Mom! Pop! No! No! -Get outta here! Pop! Stop! Beth! God... [Officer Lawson] Okay. Let's get her to the Emergency Room. [Beth] No. I don't want to go. [Officer Lawson] You'll need a medical record for court. If you're really gonna to push this. [prison sounds] [Tim] Hey, Buddy. Got a smoke? [Guard] I don't smoke. [Tim] That's alright. Man, What a nightmare. I've never been in jail before. Nobody in my family has ever been in jail before. [Guard] What did they bring you in for? [Tim] It's stupid. I caught my wife cheating on me. And we got this little girl, and I begged her to come home for her daughter, you know? And she went nuts, and... I tried to protect myself. [Guard scoffs] Women. [Tim] I sure would like to talk to my little girl. You got a phone or somethin I could use to make a quick call, you know, say goodnight to her? I've never spent a night away from her before. [Guard] Yeah sure. Why not. Everybody gets one phone call. [Phone ringing] [Beth] Hello. Honey? Sweetheart? [Tim over phone] I am so sorry, So very very sorry... I need help Beth, please. [Tim over phone] I just want to be next to you and touch you and know that everything is going to be all right with us. No. I'm nothing without you Beth. Nothing. I know that I need to change. [Tim] I'd die without you. I don't want to talk to you. Fine. Uhh. Could I talk to Laurie, then? [phone hangs up] [phone rings] [other phone rings] [Beth groans] You force me into court, and I'll paint a picture of the most unfit mother you can possibly imagine. Drugs, whoring around... -[Tim] That's what you do, isn't it? -[Tim dialing] [phone ringing] [Tim over phone] Everybody knows that you're a whore-- [Beth hangs up and hits a button on the phone] * [tense strings plucking] [Policeman over phone] 13th Precinct, Officer Thompson. This is Beth Williamson. You're holding my husband Tim for assault and battery. And he keeps calling me! [Policeman over phone] Calm down, lady. How can he be calling me? [Policeman over phone] He must have a phone. Well take it away from him! [Policeman over phone] There's nothing we can do, lady. He's allowed to make a call. -[Beth slams down phone] -[Phone rings] -[Tim sniffling] -[Phone ringing] * [dramatic music] -[Tim screams] -[phone crashes] [Tim crying] [Tim yelling] * [somber music] * [sad music] [Laurie cries] You're never gonna have to see this again. [courtroom noise] [Martin] Timothy Williamson? [Tim] Yeah. [Martin] Marty Atwater. [Tim] Hey, nice to meet you. I hear you're good. I hear you're in trouble. No prior arrests or complaints against you? Oh, no, no sir. This whole thing is so bizarre. It was pure self-defense. My... My wife she came at me with a knife. I had no choice but to swing back. Did you break anything? [huffs] I think maybe I dropped a bowl. A nose? An elbow? Are you kidding? I love my wife. If you plead "no contest," the judge gives you two years' probation. He sends you to a batterer's group once a week. With any luck, you're out in two or three days. A batterer's group?! I didn't do this. Emergency Room reports. Police reports. [sighs] They're lies. [Judge] Mr. Timothy Williamson? Let's get on with this. [secretary] Department of Social Services? [Beth] As you can see it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. It's obvious he's guilty. He should go to jail. [Nancy] Well, the Court doesn't see it quite that way. They gave him two years' probation and he has to attend group therapy. Two years' probation? He'll probably be out today. I thought they'd put him away for at least a couple of years. [Nancy] Well you've never filed a complaint with a lawyer or medical professional about the fact that your husband was abusing you. You never went on record, so the court was lenient with him. They'd probably be lenient with him, even if you did go on record. He'll do it again. [Nancy] I know. Believe me, I know. What's this? This paper provides documentation that you can have your husband arrested if he comes within 100 yards of you or your daughter. I need that? [Nancy] Well, you said your husband's been terrorizing you for years, I mean... You said that uh, he's been beating you up, trashing the house, making you report on your whereabouts... He doesn't know I said all that, does he? [Nancy] Well it all came out at his arraignment hearing. Oh, God, if he knows I said that, he'll to come after me. I can get you in a shelter. I can't do that. Let me at least tell you how to do to protect yourself. Okay? [Beth] I've got to get out of here and get to the bank before it closes. Can you stay here and wait for the locksmith? Yeah. Of course. Do you want these? Oh yeah. It's hard to believe we were ever these two people. -[sighs] -* [sad music] Terri, you know he wasn't always the way he is now. Well what was it? What changed? I don't know. [sighs] Didn't happen all at once. Just kind of happened in stages, ya know. * [sad music] Started yelling a lot. Then he started putting me down. Then shoving. Then hitting. Beth, we don't have to get into this now. I just wish I could have helped him. Don't blame yourself. This isn't your fault. -[phone ringing] -[office noise] [Teller] I'm sorry ma'am, those accounts are closed. How can they be closed? I didn't authorize anyone to close them. [Teller] All the funds were withdrawn. So the bank closed them. [sound of phone dialing] -What's the matter, Sweetie? -[Beth gasps] How am I supposed to take care of Laurie? Maybe you should've thought of that before you had me arrested. Huh? Get this through your head, Tim, it's over. You're going to find out what it's like to have everything you ever cherished taken away from you. Oh... -Don't bother looking for your car. -[keys jingle] [Laurie yelling] Mommy! Mommy! Honey? What is it, what's the matter? It was the monster. [Beth] Oh, I hate that ol' monster. I heard a noise and I woke up. It was crawling through the window. [Beth] Baby, remember what I told you about bad dreams, they can seem very real, but they're not and they can't hurt you. I think this was a real dream, Mommy. Because when I screamed, he went back out the window. [Beth] Oh honey, ohh, shh. I'll look for him. Okay? Alright. * [sad piano music] Ahh. No monster here. [sound of opening closet] And no monster there... * [dramatic music] [Beth] Get dressed. We're going to Aunt Terri's. [Ron] So what did the police say? "You're going to have to work this out with your husband, lady. We can't arrest a paper cup and a cigarette." Look he's just trying to scare you Beth. Well he's succeeded. [Terri] You get a lawyer. File for divorce. Let him know how serious you are. He'll back off. [Ron] You had him thrown in jail. His ego is wounded. He's playing games. [sighs] Terri... is this make-up covering enough? You look wonderful. [sighs] Jeez, where's my resume? It's right here next to your purse. [phone rings] Hello. [Tim over phone] How's the job market? Tell her to try on her pearls. It might help. [Terri] Go to hell! [Tim] I'm warning you, Terri, if you don't send her back home, you're gonna exactly what she's gonna get. What'd he do-- Did he threaten you? It doesn't matter. I hate dragging you into this. It doesn't matter. We'll just get an unlisted number, that's all. Look, this morning I talked to Nancy Boyle, that social worker. She thinks Laurie and I ought to go into a shelter. You have all the shelter you need right here. Okay? You better get to your interview. It'll be fine. [laughs] -[crickets chirping] -[owl hooting] [car pulling up outside and driving away] [phone crashes on ground] [door opens] [Beth] Oh, Ron, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I woke you up. -[baby cries from bedroom] -It's okay. You alright? [Beth] Yeah. [door closes] -[window smashing] -* [dramatic music] -[sound of fire] -[baby crying] [Ron] Get the baby! [Ron] Oh fuck me! [sound of fire extinguisher] [Beth] I can't do this to you. We're going into a shelter. [Terri] You don't have to do that. Ronnie tell her. [Ron] Terri, we've got the baby. [sighs] What kind of a life will you have in a shelter? What kind of a life do I have here? At least in a shelter we'll be safe. You know, it might be best for awhile. [Beth] He's right. He is. * [sad piano music] [sighs] [woman at door] Oh hi, Nancy. Hello. [children talking around the house] [Nancy] I'm gonna take you upstairs. [Nancy] Hi Kaye. -[Kaye] Oh hi, Nancy. -[Nancy] This is Beth and Laurie. -Hi. -[Beth] Hi. I hope you aren't up all night reading. My last roommate was a regular vampire. [Nancy] I'll go get you guys registered. [Beth] I didn't know we had to share a room. I know, Beth. It's not a hotel. [Beth sighs] [Laurie] You're Greg and you're Bonnie. Greg, why don't you and Bonnie go and show Laurie the play room, okay? Okay. You can have these. [Beth] Great. -Do you play cards? -[Beth] No. [Kaye] You will. Is this your first shelter? [Beth] Yeah. Have you been in more than one? From sea to shining sea. They're uh, trying to help me find a place. I shouldn't be here more than a couple weeks. Is your husband looking for you? Is water wet? It's so unfair. Isn't it? Yeah. I know. I wrote my congressman all about it. Haven't heard back yet. He's probably off beating his wife. Just a joke. Look. Why don't you make life easy on yourself and drop it. Drop what? The "I'm not like you" attitude. [Beth sighs] I'm sorry. Hey. Unpack later. Let's go play a game of gin rummy. Hmm? Great. But you'll have to teach me. I'll teach you. Come on. [cartoons on T.V.] So you gonna play that card today or? [Beth] I just can't figure out how I ended up here. Did he have fangs? Did his eye teeth stick out after dark? No. He looked normal, he sounded normal, right? He loved kids. He was the greatest guy in the world according to everyone else. Am I right? Did I nail it? [sighs] What is it? Do they pick us or do we pick them? I know I should have left him a long time ago but I kept... thinking it was my fault. Yeah, well, when you're trying to get through the day without getting your neck broken, you don't have a lot of time for reflection. I should have left him. No, I should have. I think first we stay because we think we can change them. And then we stay because we know if we try to leave, they'll kill us. Is that what you're afraid of? Five emergency rooms, one intensive care unit and nine shelters. Oh my God. [Beth sighs] * [sad music] Where's daddy? Isn't he going to live with us anymore? No. Not anymore. Laurie daddy loves you very much. You'll always have to remember that. He just has a very bad temper and it scares me. It scares me too mommy. I know. That's why we're going to live here. Where's daddy gonna live? In our house. We're going to be fine. I can take care of us. It's just going to take a little time. I love you, mommy. I love you, too. Mom, mom hi. Yeah I called to um, to let you know how sorry I am. I can hardly live with myself knowing I've hurt you. There's a lot of hurt, Tim. I'm in therapy, now it's uh, opening my eyes. This whole mess is my fault. I, I, I, just want to let her know that, you know, just talk to her on the phone, or maybe even write her a letter. I just want to let her to know how sorry I am. We don't even know where she is. They won't tell us. Look people change, Mom. I know I have. [Tim] Please would you just help me find her. I'm no good without her. She's no good without me. I know you didn't want things to turn out like this. It's not-- [Andrew hangs the phone up] [children playing] [Kaye] They found me an apartment in Kendall! [Beth] Alright! That's great. It'll be fine for awhile, until Joe shows up. He always does. Oh, I'm going to miss you! Come with us. There's room. Oh Kaye that's really sweet, but I don't think I'm ready for that. They're gonna kick you out of this place anyway before long. They need the space. [Beth sighs] Yeah, or Tim shows up. They always come looking for you. It's why you have to grab what life you can in between [Kaye] Now I can't promise you the Taj Mahal, but I can promise you it'll be a helluva lot better than this. Well... Alright, why not? [Kaye] Yeah? -Okay, roomie. -[Kaye] Okay. Now don't get too carried away, The way I figure it this way it'll only cost me half as much. [Beth laughs] Oh I see. It's not my charming company you're interested in. Oh by the way it's not half. Why not half? -You have two kids. I only have one. -Hhmm -And that boy of yours. He's a big boy. -He's a big boy. -Let's go tell 'em. -Yeah. * [happy music] -[Laurie] Oh it's so tiny. -[Beth] I love these kind of houses. [laughter] [indistinguishable chatter] [Laurie] You know what, Mom? I really love this house. [Beth] I'm glad sweetheart. -[Kaye] Tada! Look at this. -[everyone in awe] I'm afraid you're gonna have to do the honors, Beth. Joe always carved the turkey. [Beth] Oh. Well, we never sliced the turkey at our house anyway. "His Majesty" liked it torn. Preferably before it was brought to his table. I don't care if you dice it, let's eat. I have to be at work by four. [Beth] Okay. You know what? This is nice. This is really nice. -[Laurie] Yeah. -Yeah?... [restaurant noise] [Woman 1] No, no, no. I asked for the Chardonnay. [Woman 2] We asked for more garlic bread? Could we get some garlic bread please? Yeah... [Joe] Kaye. Hey, you know what they say about a bad penny... I knew it. Well what kinda father and husband would I be if I didn't check up on my kids and wife once in a while? Hmm? You leave us alone! I'm sorry. It's no harm. Honestly. Just go, okay? Maybe in our next life, huh? Yeah... Did he follow you? I don't know. What should we do? Should we call the police? No. They can't do anything or they won't do anything. I don't know. Well then let's call Nancy. No. I don't want my kids to spend Christmas in a shelter. You can't stay here though. I mean if he knows where you work, then he probably knows where you live. Beth I'm so tired, you know. I think if it wasn't for my two kids I'd stand in the middle of the street and tell him to come and get me. Don't talk like that. You duck in and out of holes like a scared rabbit for nine years you'll talk just like that, believe me! -[sound of children playing] -[traffic noise] [knocking on door] Who is it? [Joe] Greggie?! Dad?! -[Joe] Long time, no see. -[door closes] [Joe] Merry Christmas, Slugger! [Bonnie] Daddy?! [Joe] Hey, hi there gorgeous! Why don't you run out the back. Go ahead. Go to your room, kids. Go on. Go on. [Beth] Laurie. Come here. Go inside. Go ahead sweetie. Just let me see 'em Kaye. Okay, you're here. So you can have half an hour. but you'll have to promise me you'll go and there'll be no trouble. Alright? I'll put my hand on the Bible and swear on it if it'll make you happy. Who's the lovely lady? This is my friend Beth. Hi, Joe. Um, could you excuse us, just a minute. This is insane. I'm going to call the police. He's always okay the first visit. We're going to get him out of here. -I know what I'm doing, Beth. -Look, my daughter is in this house, too. We're going to get him out of here now. Then we're going to get you out. Alright? Yeah. [Kaye] You're going to have to go now, Joe. Why? We have an appointment. Oh? Well, I'll stay and watch the kids. No. Um. They're going to stay with Mrs. Miller upstairs. Sorry Joe. Whatever you say, Kaye. -[door closes] -[Kaye] I'll get the kids. [Kaye] Get inside before you catch a cold. We're in a hurry, Joe. We have to catch the bus. [Joe] I'll walk you to your stop. I don't think so. [Joe] I wasn't talking to you, Little Lady. You know you're doing a wonderful job with the kids, Kaye. Yeah, Joe. [Beth] Okay, here it comes. Goodbye, Joe. Bye Joe. So long, baby. [knife flicks] -[stabbing sounds] -* [menacing music] -Oh, my God! Stop! Stop! -[Kaye screaming] Stop him! [bystander] Someone call the cops! -[Kaye grunts] -Oh god! Oh god! Get an ambulance. -[Kaye] It's so cold. -Get a coat. [Kaye] It's so cold. [deep breathing] [Kaye] I knew it... I knew it... I just couldn't fight him anymore. I couldn't do it. [crying] Don't be mad Beth... [Beth] Shh Don't be mad. Oh god! [crying] Shhh... -* [church organ music] -[speaker] Kaye, wherever you are, we'll miss you. [people crying] Why didn't I just go ahead and call the police? You can't blame yourself. She just gave up. What's going to happen to Bonnie and Greggy? Kaye's mother is gonna take care of them. [Beth sighs] How do they get over a thing like this? [Group Leader] You're just saying the same stuff you did last week. Talk about it. Keep going. [phone ringing in background] [Bob] There's me, this big surgeon out there in the world saving lives and feeling like a god. And then there's an other me... And who's that? The ordinary guy who feels like an idiot trying to talk to his kid's teacher. He sleeps with a night light on can't get on an airplane without wondering if this is it. [Group Leader] It's easier to play the hero than be yourself. I could keep myself a secret from the world. But not from the woman I lived with. She knew me. [Group Leader] So you beat her up to keep her quiet. I'll never fix what I did. I'll never have what I lost. But at least I'm ready to stop lying to myself and the world about who and what I am. [Saunders] It's just over here. [office sounds] Is that him? -[Saunders] Take him away. -[intercom] Okay. You'll be getting a call from the D.A.'s office. [Beth] Why? Well they want your testimony for the trial. I can't do that. My husband is looking for me too. If it got in the papers-- Beth. You witnessed a murder. They can subpoena you. It's out of the question. You don't have a choice. Tell them to talk to Nancy Boyle. She's at the Domestic Violence Center. She can explain it to them. * [dramatic music] I sure I'm the last guy that you want to see, but I've got to talk to someone. [door closes] I'm going out of my mind, mom, I can't live without her. Is that group therapy helping you? Oh that's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I'm a different man. I don't have to be some god. It doesn't matter if I feel like an idiot when I'm talking to Laurie's teacher or if I sleep with a night light on or if I'm afraid to get on an airplane without thinking, "This is it." I'm ready to stop lying to myself and the world about who and what I really am. I suppose. [Andrew] Alice? [Alice] I better go. [Alice and Andrew indistinguishable chatter] * [dramatic music] [car door closes] What do you want? -Hi. I'm Tim Williamson, I-- -I know who you are. -[Tim] I'd like to speak with my wife Beth-- -[Nancy] She's not here. [Tim] Look this uh, this isn't what you think it is. The police are on their way. -You're trying to protect her. and I appreciate that-- -[Nancy] Don't come any closer. Would you just tell her, tell them both, that I love them. You have a great day. * [dramatic music] [car speeds away] How did he get the address? Well, you must have told someone. [Beth] No one except my family. [Nancy] Beth I said no one. Pack a bag. I'm going to put you and Laurie into another shelter for a while. I can't do that again Nancy. I just can't! I'll be there in twenty minutes. [Detective Brice] Police department. Detective Brice. [car speeding up] [Beth] Nancy, I know how to be careful. [Nancy] You can't stay here. [Beth] I am not going to put Laurie through anything else. It's too much. [Nancy] I'm going to put you and Laurie into a shelter outside the city. [Beth] No. No more changes. [Nancy] There is nothing to debate! You have got to protect yourself and your daughter. Nobody knows this address. There's no way he could find us here. Think about it. Think what you'll be doing to that child. Exactly. And I'm not going to apologize for it, either. [Beth sighs] [knocking on door] -[Beth] Who is it? -[Policeman] Police! Beth Williamson? Yes? This is officer Nash and I'm officer Bivens with the Metro Police Department. Where's your daughter ma'am? [Beth] In her room. What? Wait a wait a minute you can't just walk in here like that! [Officer Bivens] We have a court order ma'am Court order? For what? To place your daughter into protective custody. -[Officer Nash] Sorry to do this, ma'am. -[Beth] Hey! You can't do that! -Wait a minute! Wait a minute! -* [dramatic music] -[Laurie] Mommy! -Laurie! [Laurie] Mommy help me! Let me out! You can't just take her! -[Laurie] Mommy help me! -[Officer Nash] Easy. Easy sweetie. Laurie! -[Beth] No don't take her. Please. Don't! No! -[police siren] Nancy! -[Beth] Where is she? -[Nancy] Juvenile Hall. -[Beth] I want her back. -[Nancy] Get into a safe house or a shelter. -[Beth] Alright. I'll pack up some stuff-- -[Nancy] No. Just make a list of essentials and clothing, and I will send someone else over there and they will pick it up. I let my guard down. Yes, you did. I can't do that. No you can't. Okay. * [sad piano music] [children talking] Sweetheart. Oh honey! Oh god. Oh baby I am so sorry. Next time, I want you to stop them. There won't be a next time. Mommy's going to be sure that never happens again. [Beth sighs] [Beth] Didn't you explain my situation to him? [Nancy] I tried. [Beth] [sighs] Well I'm not going. [Nancy] Beth. You have to Beth. The D.A. subpoenaed you. You didn't tell them where I am, did you? I had to. All right then. I guess I'm gonna have to go and talk to him at least, but I will not stand up in a public court and make a target out of myself. I just won't. [Melchor] I understand your situation Beth. But your testimony is crucial. If you ignore this subpoena the judge can hold you in contempt of court. Boy... First you have my daughter put in juvenile hall because I won't go into hiding then you threaten me with jail for trying to protect myself and my daughter. [Beth sighs] Well I'll tell you something if you're gonna put me in that kind of jeopardy, you have to do something to guarantee our safety. She'll probably have to hide from her husband for the rest of her life! Look I'm sorry, but we don't have a case without her. So unless you want to let the man go free... You have a witness protection program. What's that? I guess I can talk to the judge. But it's damn expensive proposition. And it's not easy either. It means assuming an entirely new identity and no contact with your past. Absolutely none. For how long? For as long as it's necessary. And that could be for a very long time. It may be the only way to go. Are you sure that's what you want? Look I don't know much about the law but, I do know that I haven't done anything wrong here. So I guess you better just tell the judge that if he can't do this thing then he'll have to put me in jail. [phone rings in background] I'll see what I can do. [crowd noise] -Beth Williamson? -Yes? Hello there, you must be Laurie. I'm Mark Atkinson. I'm with the U.S. Marshals Witness Protection Program. I have a feeling you'll be be very sick of me before long. Sounds good to me. -[Mark] This way, please. -Come on sweety. Okay. From now on you're Jean Barrett. And Laurie, we've come up with the name Shelly for you. Why do we have to change my name? To keep us safe, honey. You'll be given new ID'S. Social Security and Driver's License when you get to Kansas. Now this is Jean Barrett's background. You were a flight attendant. You're divorced, it's all here. [Mark] You're also gonna have to change your appearance. [knock on door] -Can you take her? -[baby whining] -[Terri] Oh Beth... -[Beth sighs] [Mark] Five minutes. [Terri] Hi sweetie. Hi. Oh, God, I've missed you so much. Where are they sending you? I can't tell you. [Terri] How can we reach you? You can't even try. -Beth... -Shh -[Beth] Here. -Mom's ring, you keep that. I want you to have it. I do. Please. I love you. I know. [cries] [Terri] I love you, too. Go on now. Go on. * [sad piano music] Go... Oh, sweetheart. [gasps] * [happy music] [engine stops] [car door closes] [Beth] We're going to have our own house again. -I'll just get the luggage. -Thanks. [trunk closes] Now... you'll be under regular surveillance by patrol cars six times a day. And this is my card. You can reach me twenty-four hours a day and I or another Marshall will be here within five minutes. -[Laurie] Wee! That's fun! -Good Well. What do you think? * [happy music] Oh! Do you like it? Do you like it? Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, huh? -Do you like it? -[Laurie] [laughing] Yes. [kissing] Good. Oh honey... [Beth sighs] We who are about to die, salute you. [exhales] Oh, my gosh, Mommy. What happened? [Beth sighs] I dyed my hair. Do you like it? Really? Me, too. You've had red hair since we moved here. -Mm hmm... -Should we make my hair red too? What a good idea. Let's see, maybe red with green streaks. Really? Yeah why not? You'd like that, wouldn't you? [Laurie squeals with delight] [car door closes] [Tim] She ran away from me. She took my baby, she disappeared. -You shouldn't have gone after her. -[Tim] I'm not myself. I think maybe you are. -Mom, please. Please would you just tell me where she is. -[Alice] I don't know. Liar! It's the truth. You wouldn't know the truth if it hit you in the face! [rattles on the door] Just let me in. -Andrew! -No no no. I know he's not here. Open this damn door! -Now! [kicks door] Just get out of here, Tim. [door locks] [Laurie] Why can't I go with you? Honey I'm going to be very busy. I have business I have to take care of. [Laurie] What kind of business? Grown up stuff. -[Laurie] About daddy? -No. But you're scared about it. No I'm not. I don't want to stay at Jenny's house. I want you to stay home. It's just for a few days. What if something happens to you? [Beth] I'm gonna have a policeman watching me the whole time. Policemen makes mistakes. * [dramatic music] Sweetie, there's nothing for you to be afraid of. Yes there is, cause when I was playing with Bonnie and Greggie and a policeman came, he said Auntie Kaye was in the hospital and she'd be all right, then she died. The policeman made a sad mistake. Well, if they make a mistake about you, then you'll be dead. I don't want you to die. Honey, I'm not going to die. Are you sure? [Beth sighs] Of course I'm sure. Have you got it or do you want to run over it one more time? I've got it. I'll go see if the judge is ready. Wait a minute... "The former roommate of the slain woman is expected to testify against the killer..." What's wrong? He'll find me! It doesn't mention your name. It doesn't have to. Beth, we've got police stationed all over the courthouse. Why didn't you tell me about this before I got on the plane? Number one, you don't know he's in town. And number two, if he really wanted to know when this trial was, all he'd have to do is make a couple of phone calls. Oh you didn't tell me about that either, did you? I jumped through hoops to get you in witness protection. Now I need you to calm down. I want you cool on that stand. So let's just forget about this for ten minutes, okay?-- Yeah Kaye Ferrar forgot about it for ten minutes. [Mark] Showtime. [Marshall clears throat] Did Kaye Ferrar share her views of her husband with you? Sometimes, I guess. [Marshall] She did? Yes. [Marshall] Did she ever tell you she thought Joe Ferrar was disturbed? Yes. Do you have any idea why she would lead him on, knowing his precarious mental and emotional state of being-- [Melchor] Objection! ! [Judge] Sustained. [gasps from everyone] I'll rephrase. Mrs. Barrett, in your deposition you said, and I'm quoting now, "Joe Ferrar is an extremely sick man." Now did you think he was sick the day he showed up at your apartment? Yes. Why didn't you call the police? He seemed okay. He acted calm. Well which is it? Extremely sick or calm? You're contradicting yourself-- -Objection, your honor. -[Judge] Sustained. [Marshall] But you say he acted sick and yet you did nothing? Wait a minute. I'm not the one on trial here. He is! How dare you try to muddy Kaye's character? How dare you point fingers at me? [Judge] Order! He hunted her down and he killed her! -Objection! -[Judge] Counselor... -Beth. -I'm sick of hiding! I'm sick of wondering when or where it's going to happen to me. And I'm sick of people like you doing nothing about it! Counselor, control your witness or she'll be placed in contempt of Court. They hunt us down. We hide. They find us. We go deeper into hiding. They find us. We run. It happens over and over and over again. And all the time in the back of your mind you're terrified that the day is gonna come -when there won't be anyplace left to hide. -* [sad piano music] You fight that with everything that's in you. But the fear wears you out. [crying] Kaye just wore out. [airport chatter] You did a lot of good on that stand today. Kaye would have done the same for me. I was really proud of you. Thank you. Bye. Bye. -Goodbye, Nancy. -Goodbye, Mark. [Beth] Thank you. I can't wait to get home. I miss Laurie so much. * [menacing music] [doorbell rings] Who is it? [Mark] It's Mark. Hi. Come on in. [Mark] Thank you. Want some coffee? [Mark] No thanks. I can't stay. Oh. You want to sit down? [Beth] What's wrong? I have a new assignment effective tomorrow morning. [Beth] Oh, really? Oh that's too bad. We're going to miss you. They're closing your file, Beth. You're out of witness protection. I thought I was in it as long as it was necessary. Joe Ferrar was convicted this morning. But I risked my life! I thought I got protection in exchange for that. Yes, but you knew it wouldn't last forever. But I still need it! If he find us, he'll kill me! [Mark] No one directly connected with Ferrar's case poses a threat to you. -Look, I agree it stinks... -[Beth sighs] We were just starting to like it here too. I can't believe that I was finally sleeping nights. I talked to the lead officer at your precinct. They're still going to keep an eye on you. -[Beth sighs] -We've arranged that you can keep the house. You'll have have to start paying rent in a few months. I'm sorry, Beth, I talked until I was blue in the face to get your protection extended. [Beth sighs] I don't blame you. But I'll tell you something. My little girl is going to take ballet. And she's going to her prom. And she's going to graduate from college. And I'm going to do whatever it is that I have to do, in order to be around for her for a long, long time. [throws towel] [Beth sighs] [Laurie] Please, Mommy, I don't know. You're getting colder. [Laurie] Tell me. Look up around the porch. [Laurie] I don't know! Honey. The porch light is on and it's still day time. Oh. "Run next door for help." [Beth] Right! Good girl. [Beth] Now, we can have our hot chocolate. [Laurie] Thanks mommy. [thunder clap] [doorbell rings] [door opens] Hi, uh, I'm Jean Barrett. This is my daughter Shelly. We live across the street. Osgood don't like for me to let people up on the porch when he isn't home. I understand. All I'm asking is that you call the police if you see this man. Or if you see my front porch light on during the day. We have reason to believe he may want to harm us. I don't know you, honey. [Beth sighs] Well, that's the whole block. Yeah, hi. Is this the Board of Education? Good, listen, I'm new in town and I have an eight year-old daughter who's uh, very talented at art. I was wondering, do you have any special public schools with a curriculum geared towards art? Oh, great. In terms of safety, one of the most important things you can do is to phone into your check-in partner on a regular basis. Those calls should be made every three hours. Excuse me, I'm new in this area and I don't really know anyone, so I don't have a check-in partner. [Leader] Any volunteers? I'm Lois Banks. I think we live in the same neighborhood. How do you know? I've seen you at my daughter's school. I think your little girl is in the gifted art program, right? Right. If she ever needs a ride home or anything... Oh, thanks. That'd be great. It's so hard starting over in a new place. Do you ladies mind if we join you? [everyone laughs] * [happy music] [sound of children playing] -[Laurie] Bye, Mom. -[Beth] Bye, sweetie. * [menacing music] [car engine starts] Hello. [car door shuts] [sound of vacuum] [Osgood] Hey, you! What do you think you're doing? [Tim] I happen to be the owner of this house. My tenant is a little worried about security. Her ol' man's after her or something. So I'm just uh, checking around. You got a problem with that? Oh, no I guess not. [vacuum turns off] [dialing phone] [Lois on phone] Hello? -Hi, [Lois]. It's me. -[Lois] Oh hi. 1:05 and I'm still alive. I'll talk to you again at 4. [Lois] Listen. I can pick Laurie up after school. -Really? -[Lois] Sure. Oh god, that would be great. Yeah, if you pick her up, I'd have just enough time to get to the store. [gate closes] [door closes and locks] [flicking sound of lighter] [Tim] Little Red Riding Hood. You got a cool beer in that ice box, honey? [children talking] [Lois] Hi, honey. [Laurie] Hi. Mrs. Banks [Lois] Hi, Shelly. Oh I'm taking you home today. Why don't you hop in front here. [doors close] [flicking sound of lighter] [Tim] How's Laurie get home from school? [Beth] She gets a ride. [Tim] What time? It varies. What time? [Beth sighs] After three. Good. That gives us a little time to celebrate this reunion, huh? -Have a drink with me. -[whiskey pouring] You know I don't drink. [Tim] Well I've been waiting for this toast for a long time. Make an exception. To us. You know, it's cold in here. I'm going to go get another shirt. [Tim] Sit down! All I ever wanted was to care for you and Laurie. You still could. [laughing] Do you think I'm that stupid? You know she's doing really well in school. I should show you some of her drawings. Would you just sit there and shut up. Beth. All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted in this whole world was everything you took away from me. [Tim] Beth! Beth! What are you doing Beth, huh? -What are you doing, huh? -I told you-- I told you I was cold. Just get over there and sit down. I said sit down! [Eula] Here you are. [Osgood] Oh thanks. Say when did Sip Johnson sell that house? [Eula] I didn't know he had. Well, he did. I saw the new owner. Not too friendly. He was checking the side gate for his tenant. I almost thought he was a burgular. [Eula] Hmm... Tim, we could work it out. You, me and Laurie. Oh don't you worry Beth. We're going to be together, the three of us forever... * [somber music] Oh, God, please... Oh, God, please... She's your little girl... And you took her away from me! -[Tim] Aaah. There she is. -* [tense music] Bye, sweetie, see you tomorrow. Bye, Mrs. Banks! [car door closes] * [music intensifies] She's much prettier than you ever were, Beth. Don't hurt her, Tim. Don't please. [crying] * [dramatic music] Call the police! Oh, my Lord! Little girl! Little girl! Little girl! Don't go in there. Don't go in there. Don't go in there. No, no. Oh, you can't stop fate. Please don't hurt her. No! Don't go in there. Don't go in there. Come here to me, honey. Don't go in-- Come to me, honey. Come to me. Why? [Eula] Just do like I say. -[Eula] Come on dear. -No! What the hell is going on? Oh, God, it worked. -[Laurie] Mommy! -[Osgood] You come on in the house. -* [menacing music] -What'd you do, Beth, huh? Beth What'd you do? What do you think is on the other side Beth? Huh? What do you think is out there? You think maybe we'll be together, huh? -[Beth] Hell. -[slap] -[punch] -[Beth moans] What'd you do, Beth, huh? What'd you do? Huh? -What'd you do?! -[Beth choking] What'd you do? What'd you do? Huh? Huh? Huh? [brakes screech] How should I do it, Beth huh... [hammer cocks] How should we do it? A bullet to the heart? Or maybe just a quick shot to the head. Huh? -Huh? Look what you made me do. -[crashing noise in background] [Tim] Look what you made me do now. [Officer 1] Drop the gun! Get out of here! [Officer 1] Come on. Get out of here! -[Officer 2] Put it down. -[Beth groaning] Drop it! I got time. * [somber music] -[Beth drops on floor] -[gun drops] [Beth coughing] [Officer 2] Alright. Let's go. [Beth coughing] -[Eula] There she is. -[Laurie] Mommy! [Beth] Honey. Oh god. Oh, baby, are you okay? [Laurie] Yeah. Oh, thank you. Thank you. [Beth sighs] -* [somber piano music] -[paramedics talking] * [dramatic music sting] * [slow piano version of "Blaster Master" theme] [car engine starts] * [happy clarinet music] * [Multicom Entertainment Group jingle]
