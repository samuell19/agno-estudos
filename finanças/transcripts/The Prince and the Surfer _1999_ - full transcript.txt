(gentle serene music) - Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about this and they wished they may drop down dead in their tracks if they ever tell or rat. Can you imagine? Hi, I'm Jon Voight, and you may know me from some of the roles I've played in movies such as "Mission Impossible," "Varsity Blues." But what you may not know is that I'm a concerned father. I know how important it is to give our children good viewing materials. My friends at Paul Family Films have taken these classic stories of Mark Twain, these stories that we've all grown up on and we've learned to love, and they've put a modern twist on them. And I know that you're gonna find them charming and amusing, and most importantly, that they still carry the most precious and cherished values of yester year that should serve as a legacy for all future generations.

All right. I want to tell you this story I heard from my grandfather who heard it from his grandfather, who heard it from, oh, uh, somebody, I forget. Oh, right from his grandfather. Anyway, it's about these two dudes who were so alike, they should have been brothers. I mean, they were brothers. No, no, no. They were supposed to be brothers. That's right. But when they were born, there was this really big mess up and they were born to two different families. This one dude who was, like, a totally awesome surfer, was born in this mellow little town of Palm Bay, California, while the other one was born in a much more royal kind of place. ♪ Cooler than me ♪ ♪ Wish I was better ♪ ♪ You're cool ♪ (bright orchestral music) - Good morning, my dear Prince Edward. (Baumgarten claps) I have spoken with your mother, the queen. - Please. Is it good news? - Oh, I, I don't know if I should say. It was given to me in complete confidence. - As are your midnight visits to the royal kitchen. - A master negotiator already. - A lesson learned from my father. - God rest his soul. Your mother, the queen, has decided that you shall accompany her on the first historic visit of the Gelfland nobility to the United States of America. - Oh, how joyous. - I knew you would be pleased. - I have dreamed of such an excursion since I was a child. - That long? - They say that America's the land of opportunity, the home of the brave. Give me your tired. Your poor. Your huddled masses. - Yearning to breathe free. - I wish to see it all, Minister Kratski, from the Redwood Forest to the Gulfstream waters. - You are a young man now, Prince Edward. The heir to your father's throne. - Yes, but Minister, I merely- - Gelfland must be your only concern. If we cannot obtain an international trade partner, our economy faces complete financial ruin. - I will not let Gelfland down, Minister. - I know you will not, my Prince. - Perhaps the minister has a point. After all, I understand that this California province that we plan to visit is a cultural wasteland and its people are tediously common. - We are all God's children, my Prince. And I must believe that these people of America are just like us.

How are you? - Man, what a day out there. Nice waves, smooth, long swells. Perfect for old timer long boarders, like yourself. - Old timer? Who you calling old timer? Tell you what, I still got the moves. Bet I can show you a thing or two out there. - Yeah, that so? - Yeah. Ooh. All right. Back when I was a kid, we'd go surfing when the water was 50 degrees. - Yeah. - That's right. Big five-o. 50 degrees and we didn't need no sissy wetsuits either. - Right. - Okay. I'll tell you what. Here. - Thank you. - Next time you got time, we'll do a session. All right? See you if can cramp the old man's style. - Hey, dad, you should, uh, check out today's business section. There's this, uh, new company that just went public called Funlimited. - Limited Fun? - No, they're Funlimited. See, they design, like, amusement parks and virtual reality game centers, golf resorts, stuff like that. - Okay, Cash. What's the scheme this time? - It's not a scheme, dad. Solid money making venture. I mean, man, we clear a couple hundred bucks a week, stick that money into Funlimited, watch it expand. And boom. - Boom? - Boom. Easy money, man. I mean, we get on the board of Funlimited, and we design our own amusement centers. I'd be in charge of Surf Land and hey, you were the best cop in the history of Palm Bay, right? You could be in charge of Super Cop Land. - Super Cop Land. (laughs) - We live out our years in a 10 room beach house at The Bahamas, huh, huh? - [Johnny] Styling then, huh? - [Cash] Hey, uh, you check the want ads today? - You know I already got a job. - Well, yeah, but it doesn't quite match the excitement of being a cop now, does it? - Now, don't kid yourself, son. Selling insurance over the phone is nothing but thrills and excitement. - Yeah, well, I saw, what about this job, huh? Five star resort needs security officer. - No, I don't think mom would like me in that line of work anymore. - Yeah, well, who am I to argue with the dude that can handle 60 degree surf? - That was 50 degree surf. It was the middle of the winter. It was double overhead. No wetsuits and no leashes. Hey, Cash. Thanks for coffee. - Later, dude. - Bahamas. (upbeat rock music) ♪ Cool you're so cool ♪ ♪ Cooler than me ♪ ♪ Cool cool cooler ♪ ♪ C-c-cooler than me ♪ (bright orchestral music) - And this is your suite, Prince Edward. - The American Consortium was quite gracious to provide for our stay. - Oh, yes. This 500 acre resort consists of 10 individual estates such as this. Swimming pools, stables, golf course, and something the Americans call mini-golf. - And your quarters, Minister. Are they adequate for your needs? - Oh, my needs are a mere trifle compared to the welfare of our land. - Gelfland will not simply endure this economic crisis. It will grow and prosper. We will see to it. - This is just like my room at home. - (sighs) Excuse us. - They simply moved my furniture from the castle. - Minister thought it, it would put you at ease to be in familiar, surroundings. A home away from home. - Wonderful. It's as if we never even left. - Edward, tell me your troubles. - No, my Queen. I know that you have enough to worry about as it is. - Well, the queen and the prince just left the room and only a concerned mother and unhappy son remain. - I know that this journey is of utmost importance to our country. But... (sighs) Is it wrong for me to wish to see America? (Queen laughs) - No, no. It's not wrong. I also wish I had time to really experience this land. - You do? - Yes. You know, we're very much the same. Edward, when I was young and I felt the weight of the world on my shoulders, I would venture out into the courtyard hoping to find the path to my destiny in the cold night air. - Where will I find my destiny then? - My son, I have a feeling your destiny will find you. - Halt. Leave them closed. (tense brooding music) - Hey, man. Aren't you supposed to be somewhere? - Aren't you? - Hey, what's going on, guys? - Cash, what's up, man? - [Friend] How's it going, man? - [CT] Saw you catch some nice waves today. - Yep. Hey, so what's going on? - Same old. Still trying to decide whether or not to have brunch in Beverly Hills or hang out with them supermodels that keep calling us. - Yeah, tough choice, dude. - Yeah, well, we can always do the same thing we did yesterday. - Hang out and do nothing? - Bingo. - Great, man. - Well, you figure something out then, man. - I don't know. There must be some way we can make some cash, you know? Do something. - [CT] Yeah? Like what? - I don't know. We gotta get out of Palm Bay, all right, dude? And start a surf shop in Australia or, I don't know, a skate park in Europe somewhere. I don't know, anything. - What, man, and leave all this excitement? (scoffs) Well, well, if it ain't sweet, little Melissa. - What's my name? - Uh, darling Melissa. Okay. Mel, Mel, your name's Mel. - You're the toughest dude I know, Mel. - Thanks. I think. - Hey, why weren't you out surfing on dawn patrol? - Uh, I couldn't find my wetsuit. - Wetsuit? No, I once surfed in 40 degree waters with only my trunks on. - Sure. - Would you believe 50 degrees? You two want a ride? Plenty of room on the board. (car thuds) (horn beeps) - If you dented it, you die. Hey, it's trash Canty. - What do you think of my new car? - Well, it's shiny on the outside, but it breaks down a lot and makes a lot of noise and it's slower than it looks, so I guess it reminds me of you. - At least I don't have to push with my feet to make it go. (engine revs) (tires screech) - Some guys, they get whatever they want whenever they want it. - Trash Canty. Actually that's pretty funny. - Yeah, well, not as funny as, uh, sweet little Melissa. (upbeat pop music) - You ever work security? (fly buzzing) - Well, not security per se, but for 10 years I was a- - You've held several different jobs over the past year. - What's up with that? - Drinking problem? - No. - Drugs? - No, of course not. Look, my record's right there. - Violence. - Wife beater, right? - (sighs) No, my wife passed away two years ago. - You're not the one who, uh, you know... - No. - Hey, this is law enforcement, Canty. We have to ask these things. - We get big people here at Windsor Resort. Big people. - Millionaires. - Movie stars. - Hey, we got a queen staying here right now. A prince too. - A queen. - That's right. - She's got the crown and everything. - She does? - It's why we're beefing up security. - And danger could be lurking around any corner of this resort, Canty. That's why as a security agent, you must engage all five senses. Hearing, seeing. - Smelling, tasting. - And hearing. (flies buzzing) - You see, Canty, a guy like you maybe, uh, maybe you've gone a little soft. Maybe your senses aren't quite as sharp. - Maybe you're just not security guard material. (Johnny laughs) - Yeah, yeah. Maybe you're right. - Maybe we are. - Maybe. - But I gotta tell you something. I mean, I can tell just by looking at you guys right off the bat, that this is a crack operation. Oh, yeah. I mean, the surveillance equipment is, it's advanced. And this technique you have, I'll tell you, it's state of the art. Yeah, yeah. Even with all my years in the police force, I've never seen such professionalism. - Police force? - Wait a minute, you were a cop? - Yeah. 10 years. Detective. Robbery, homicide. - Detective. - Yeah, uh, look, Canty, we've decided to reconsider your application for employment for a trial period. - Welcome aboard. - Well, that was great. Now let's try this. The United States of America- - 42 presidents. - The shortest term was held- - William Henry Harris. - It lasted only- - 30 days. - Because he had- - Pneumonia. - Please do not take offense, my Prince, but I no longer wish to play with you. - Excellent, then let us go outside for a walk. - Minister Kratski says that we must stay inside and focus on your lessons. Although I dare say you know more about America than most Americans. - I only know ink on a page. Facts, figures, tallest, highest, longest. That will never equal touching American soil, walking the American streets, experiencing the American people. - Sometimes in life we are disappointed. Consider the caterpillar who longs to be a hawk. - Let's say your caterpillar forms a cocoon at the base of a potted tomato plant at the home of a botanist in France. - Go on. Go on. - The botanist travels on holiday to the United States. He stands on the shore of the Pacific Ocean holding the potted plant with the attached cocoon. - Interesting. - The butterfly never saw the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, it cannot relay to others its experiences. Therefore, it was as if it was never truly there. - You win. Let's go. - Yes. (bright orchestral music) (gentle suspenseful music) - You were told to remain in your room. - My only intention was to experience how the people of this country live. All I want is to see America. - And America you shall see, my son. - My Queen. - I have been invited to the Palm Bay Aquarium and I would like Edward to go in my place. - Is that safe? I am, uh, worried that, uh, the prince might be exposed to the dangers and vices. - Soon Edward will be king. Your king. And he needs to learn about the responsibilities that come with representing his country abroad. - Perhaps you are right. It may be time for him to stretch his wings. - There is a condition. - For the opportunity to catch even a glimpse of this country, I shall do anything. - Well, you must share your limousine with your betrothed, Lady Galina and her aid Constance. (waves crashing) (seagulls cawing) - I can't see anything. - What is there to look at? Just a lot of idiotic, insipid Americans. - I do not believe that is an appropriate attitude from a visitor to a foreign land, Lady Galina. - And I do not believe that it is appropriate for a boorish fellow like yourself to reprimand my lady. - Is that so, Constance? - Yes, that is so, Baumgarten. - Extended periods in the warm sun have evidently deteriorated what little brains and personalities these Americans may have had, anyway. - Perhaps as an experiment, you should step out of this automobile to determine if this warm sun could melt the block of ice encasing your heart. - What a grand idea. I would have you open the door for me, but I wouldn't want to be responsible for blistering those tender, girlish hands of yours. - Lady Galina. - Baumgarten. - Constance. - Edward. - [Everyone] Silence. (Edward sighs) (upbeat rock music) - [Cash] So what are we gonna do now? - I dunno. Same old. - Same old? Come on. We gotta do something new here. - Ah, CT will be here any minute. - Yeah, right, he won't have any ideas. Come on. - What's up? - What's up, CT? How's it going? Hey, what's that? - Oh yeah, I saw that in the news today. Something about a prince and a queen or something visiting Palm Bay. - Really? Where are they from? - I don't know. I changed the channel for the surf report. - [Cash] Come on, you don't know where they're from? - I do. From the capital city of What Difference Does It Make in the country of Who Cares Land. - Fine, but look, you guys, there's other places in this world besides Palm Bay, all right? And they have awesome stuff like castles and kings and queens. - Speaking of queens, my brother said he could hook us up over there at El Burrito Queens. - Great. - Oh, excellent. I'll be covered in zits by the end of the summer. - Come on. - Yo, man. That's what I'm talking about. You know, I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life in this town making beef and bean burritos, when there's a whole world of opportunity out there. - Yeah, well, maybe we don't have to make burritos. - Yeah, that's it. Keep talking, CT. (gentle orchestral music) (sun roof whirring) - Lady Galina, what are you doing? - Galina. (upbeat rock music) - Serfs, peasants, cretins. Wow. - Wow. - Man, no one listens to me anyway. - Come on, Cash. (upbeat rock music) - Hey. (club members exclaiming) (gentle whimsical music) (gentle suspenseful music) - Oh, yeah. Now this is what I'm talking about. (Cash laughs) Hello? Princess? - Baumgarten, is that you? - Uh, no, it's your bellboy, me. I got your lunch. - Ah, please do be certain that the port has exactly two pinches of cinnamon. The previous servant only brought one pinch. - All right. Uh, it smells like two to me. - Excellent. And I expect it to be piping hot. - Uh, by the way, your High Royal Prince guy, you wouldn't happen to know which suite the princess is staying in would you? - Simply walk into the the hall and follow the nearest blast of Arctic air. - Uh, thanks. I guess. - Wait, you've forgotten your- - Sorry, dude, I forgot my board. (whimsical music) - Astonishing. - Totally. - We are nearly identical. - Yeah, it's like we're clones or something. But you're not from around here. You're, you're definitely from out of town. - I am the prince of Gelfland. - Cool. - And you, are you employed at this resort as a servant? Your clothes, they, they do not seem to fit. Your tailor should be reprimanded immediately. - Uh, no, dude. It's supposed to be like that. It's, it's a surfer thing. - A surfer. A real American surfer? What is your life like? - It's a real hoot, Prince. - And your name? - Tom. Tom Canty. But my friends call me Cash, 'cause, uh, we're gonna have a lot of it one day. - How did you get here, Cash Canty? - You're holding it, dude. (Edward gasps) - Champion. I'd give anything to ride upon this. - Go ahead. - No, but I'm not allowed to leave here. - You wanna ride it? Go out and ride it. - But I... - Don't be such a wuss. - Prince Edward of Gelfland is not a wuss. - Yeah. (walkie-talkie buzzes) - Yeah, we got a 47B in estate three. - Armed intruder. - Yeah, leaky faucet. - Sounds like a job for the new guy. - (laughs) Yeah, get on it. One Adam 12, we got an officer down. (walkie-talkie buzzes) - What if someone should enter this suite while you are occupied? - You kidding? I'll be the man. If somebody wants to come in here, I'll just yell, "Prince wants his privacy. Bite me." Yeah. - Yeah, I doubt I would utilize that particular phraseology under even extreme circumstances. - Oh, all right then, uh, what would you say? - I would appear quite unhappy then simply utter the word dismissed. - Oh, okay, cool. Well, if anybody downstairs gives you any problems, you can just say whatever. - Say whatever comes to mind. - Uh, no. "Whatever." - Whatever? - Whatever. - Whatever. - Whatever. - Uh, whatever? - Dismissed. (clears throat) - Hey, you. You think you can sneak around here without my knowing about it? You got another thing coming, my friend. - I'm merely going for a stroll. - All right, that does it. I need backup here in sector one immediately. Do you copy? - Sir, sir, really I- - Dean. - It's not... - Look, just get lost, kid. Before I have to throw your sorry butt in to jail. - Uh, yes, yes. I, I will get lost to explore this land, this land that I love. I will climb upon my skateboard and roll right into the heart of America. - Go. - Yes. (Edward thuds) - Ooh. (Edward exhales sharply) - Perhaps I shall walk into the heart of America. (gentle bright music) - Whatever. Dean. Dean? (Cash laughs) Oh, man. (electric blues guitar music) (traffic rumbling) (horns beeping) - Dun, dun, dun. You're going down, Prince Cash. I don't think so, Dougie. You're going down. (Cash singing) Dismissed. Dismissed. Dismissed. (bright energetic music) (cans rattling) (Edward gasping) - [Alarm] Step away from the car. (alarm blaring) - Oh, yes, this must be the problem. This must be jammed in this spot. Let me get this off here. Hello, yes. Oh, um, hmm. I see why you might be upset, but understand that there's no harm taking place here. We're being rational American citizens who understand our finest judiciary concepts of innocent until proven guilty. Whatever? (tense brooding music) (Edward groans) (tense suspenseful music) (alarm blaring) - [Melissa] Cash, are you okay? - I believe my head has suffered a contusion based on the impact. - No, we gotta jam. Whoa. Come on, let's go. Run, you spaz. (tense suspenseful music) Run. - My lady, surely you jest. - [Melissa] Why are you talking so weird? - Nothing will get me on that wheel board for a suicidal journey down that concourse. - Wanna bet? - Whoa! (tense suspenseful music) (Edward shouting) (Edward crashes) (door knocks) - Oh, Minister, please come in. What can I do for you? - What's this my guards tell me about a disturbance? - Oh, that. That. That was nothing. It was just a minor incident. Some local kid. Listen, you have nothing to worry about. We have your back covered. - Well, from this moment on, we will, uh, watch our own back. Thank you. - Sir. If I may, our security staff is, well, they're very capable. Tell you the truth, I would feel much better if I could work with your guards to keep you safe. - How you and your inept band of merry men feel is not my concern. - I see. Okay, I'll level with you. I used to be a cop. And, you know, the only people who didn't want us around were the people who had something to hide. - But, um, you are not a cop now, are you? - No, I'm not. - Well, then why don't you be a good boy and go back to your post and let the experts protect the royals? Good day. - You're royal all right. You're a royal pain in the... (gentle menacing music) - My dear sir. In order for our deal with Funlimited to be consummated, I shall of course require the payment to be in Gelfland bills. - Oh, what's up, guys? (gentle whimsical music) Prince says right hand up. Prince says left hand up. Prince says right foot up. Prince says hop up and down. Prince says shake it. Yeah. Prince says slide. Prince says slide. Right foot up. Dang. You guys are good. (hands smack) - One might have given me instructions on how to properly stop this hellish contraption. - Don't be such a wuss. You stopped, once you hit the lawn and the tree and the fence and the rose bushes. - The people of this land certainly seem a bit... Testy. - This land? What is wrong with you? - Wrong? What do you mean? - You've been talking like some geek out of a Shakespeare play. - No, no. I'm Cash. Cash Canty. Typical American boy. Um, that is, dude. - Well, at least you made it home. (helicopter whirring) (dog barking) - Home. - You wanna hang? - Hang what? - Okay, you want me to bail? - Uh, whatever. - Fine. Whatever. Take an aspirin and maybe I'll talk to you tomorrow. (Edward stammering) - Also, I have scheduled our first meeting with the director of the American Trade Consortium. - Excellent. I will stress that I will accept no charity nor surrender autonomy. - Rest assured that I shall express your wishes to the consortium. But... Your task, my Queen, should be to generate publicity for our cause. - Is that more important than my attending the negotiations? - Well, in many ways, yes, my Queen. You see, the Americans will not vote for trade with a land which they fear potential hostilities. And to the American public, you are Gelfland, my Queen. And everything that you do while you are visiting here should reflect positively upon our land. - (sighs) For Gelfland. - Yes. Very wise, my Queen. Very wise indeed. Breakfast with the Palm Bay Historical Society at seven o'clock. Then a tour of the Natural History Museum at 10:15, lunch with the delegates from the Association of War Widows, 12:35. At 2:20, photos with the mayor. At 3:45, you are responsible for hosting cocktails with the North American Trade representatives. This evening's event will involve... (gentle pensive music) - [Cash] I'm old enough to dress myself. Be gone. - My Prince. (door knocks) My Prince, is there something wrong? - I look like my crazy Aunt Beatrice. - You do not have a crazy Aunt Beatrice. You have a crazy Uncle Beatrice. But we are not to speak of that one. - Look, Boomgarden. - Baumgarten, my Prince. - Yeah. Whatever. - Are you feeling well? - Well, look, it's been fun and all, but I need to tell you that I mean, I'm really, really- - I hope you're happy, you royal buffoon. Because you probably whined like a baby about what happened in the limo, your mummy's little puppet boy Kratski banished us to our rooms. Now I have to stare at your whiny little face. (door slams) - She digs me. - You were about to say that you're not really, really what? - I'm really, really looking forward to a cool, um, pleasant week. - Perhaps we should call the royal physician and have him give you a complete physical. - Um, dismissed. (answering machine beeps) - [Johnny] Oh, hi, um, this is dad. Um, I guess you'll be happy to know I, I got that job at the Windsor Resort. Unfortunately, I'll be working all night. All right, you stay safe, son. (answering machine beeps) (phone rings) - [Answering Machine] Hello, you've reached the Cantys. You know what to do. Bye. (answering machine beeps) - [Cash] Uh, hey, Dad. It's me. I'm just calling to say that everything's cool and I'm gonna be spending the night at my friend, um, Eddie's. I'll see you later. Bye. (answering machine beeps) (dog barks) (gentle melancholic music) (Queen gasping) - Edward? (Queen sighs) Sleep well, my son. (gentle melancholy music) (gentle sanguine music) (Queen laughs) - (chuckles) I'll tell you what, I'm gonna give you a 9.5 for the twirl, but not gonna get gold 'til you nail that landing. (Queen laughs) - Thank you. - No, I'm the one who should be thanking you. - Why? - You're the first person who's smiled at me all day. - Oh, that's hard to believe. - Well, you know, being a security guard, it's one of those invisible jobs. People don't really see you 'til they need you. - Oh, I'm sure they need you all the time. - Well, actually today I did respond to several code 47Bs. - Really? - Yeah, that's the truth. - Well... I've gotta go. - Twirl on back to your room. Watch the landings. (laughs) All right? - Wait a minute. What's your name? - My name? - Where I'm from, when one saves a lady, one tells a lady his name. - Johnny. Johnny Canty. - Well, it's, it's nice to meet you Mr. Canty. - So are you with the people from Gelfland? - Yes. - Do you work for the queen? - Yes. I, I am, uh, her personal assistant. - Did you know that in America when a guy risks life and limb to save a beautiful lady from certain danger, not to mention embarrassment, it's customary for the lady to tell the gentleman her name. (Queen sighs) - Abby. Abby, uh, Royal. - Abby Royal. - I have to go. It's nice meeting you. - Goodnight. Nice to meet you, Abby Royal. - Gentlemen, this is truly an historic occasion. The perfect example of corporate and governmental synergy. Funlimited was looking to create the ultimate resort. A haven for the privileged class to celebrate the sport of kings and Gelfland. Gelfland was saddled with the remnants of a soft and ineffectual monarchy. Was, to be candid, looking for a bailout. And now once we have, um, removed the approximately 4,000 homes and townships from our westernmost tip, you will be free to break ground and transform the failure of Gelfland into the future of A Golfland. (upbeat rock music) - [Operator] Windsor Grand Estates. How may I direct your call? - Yes, estate number five, please. I would like to speak with Prince Edward of Gelfland. - [Operator] Your name, sir? - Uh, my name? Well, um, Cash. Cash Canty. - [Operator] That line's restricted. (dial tone buzzes) - Hello? Hello? Pardon me, madame. Would you happen to know where breakfast is being served? - Served? - Well, yes. I see several commoners eating their meals and I was wondering where I could be attended to. - Excuse me. Who are you calling a commoner? You smarty ass surfer punk? - Hey, what's up, Di? - Does this punk hang with your crew? - Mm, yeah, what can I say? We haven't got him quite trained yet. - Well, I'll tell you what, you keep working at it. So, uh, how's your mom? - Ah, she's cool. You're coming on Saturday, right? - Definitely. Okay, I'll check you. - Later. - (sighs) Thank you. Twice now you have appeared as from the heavens to save my life. - Twice? Oh, come on, Cash. I've known you since third grade when you barfed on my Keds. - Yes, when I barfed on your Keds, miss... Miss... - Wow. You have lost it. Mel. My name is Mel. - Mel, yes, of course. It is a decidedly odd name for such a lovely young lady. - Okay, now you're hallucinating. - Mel, do not underestimate yourself. In the time that I've known you, I've witnessed your acts of intelligence, resourcefulness, and compassion. - Wow, that smack on the head really freaked you out. Okay, how many fingers am I holding up and is it blurry? - [Cash] A quiz? - [Baumgarten] Shall I begin? - I'm on the edge of my seat, B man. - A common man finds a bag filled with $4 million in cash. - Huh? - Cash. - What do you mean by that? - Money. Cash. - Yeah, right, of course. Right. Go ahead. - Question. Should he keep it? - Of course he keeps it. Possession is 9/10 of the law. Thy finders are thy keepers. - Ma'am, you have exactly 30 minutes until your tour of the museum. - (sighs) More foolish pomp and circumstance. - Ma'am? - I should be assisting the minister in the negotiations of the consortium. But no, I'm gonna be surrounded by journalists who fancy my photograph because for some reason they feel a woman is more attractive with a crown than without. If I were king, things would be very different. - Yes, Ma'am. - What is that? - It's an American periodical, your Highness. I confiscated it from Ms. Galina. Photographs of impossibly thin women dressed in something they refer to as casual chic. - This periodical is a fragrance. - I believe there are perfume samples within. Minister Kratski was right. This is a morally degenerated nation. - Of course it is. - Now why are you guys always messing around? - We want you outta here, punk. - Well, we're kicking here. Hey, man. - [Bully] What's your problem, man? - Hey, man, why don't you stop tripping? - Hey, you owe me 200 bucks for denting my mustang, Canty. - I damaged your horse? - It's over now, man. - Uh, CT, There's something I need to tell you. - [CT] No one messes with Cash. - Interesting. Um, you seem to have all of the material things you could possibly desire. However, your anger towards these people, um, or rather towards us seems to stem from your own insecurities. (skateboard thuds) If you are bored with having it all, then perhaps the problem is not with your social class. - Shut up, trash. - The problem is with you. You are nothing but frightened cowards. (tense suspenseful music) (Edward groans) (metal clangs) - Whatever. - Man, why'd you let him push you around like that? - CT, Cash is a little off his game. He took a pretty big spill yesterday. Are you okay? - Hey, Cash. I gotta tell you, man, you look pretty pathetic letting that dude walk all over you. - Why don't you shut up, CT? Kicking that loser's butt doesn't mean we win anything. Didn't you just hear what Cash said? - No, I couldn't hear. I was too busy watching his face hit the pavement. - Please, do not argue. - If I would've known Cash was gonna sketch out, I would've dropped that dude. - Really, you do not understand. - [CT] Oh, really? - From where I stood, you were too busy wetting your pants to do much of anything about it. - You want some of this? - I'm gonna bury you. - I'm not Cash Canty. - What? - What? - I am Prince Edward of Gelfland. It is a long story, but essentially your friend Cash and I have exchanged identities. - Oh, I see. So that's why you said all those sweet things about me because you're not Cash, you're not yourself. - Well, in a sense, yes, you are correct. Ow. - You're a jerk. You finally say something nice about me and you make a big joke about it. - Miss Mel, I really am the Prince of Gelfland. - You're a jerk, Cash. - Miss Mel, please wait. Miss Mel, wait. (gentle serene music) (birds chirping) - [Queen] Hi. - Abby. - Wow, what a surprise. - Wow. Oh, you're stunning. No, really. You do. You look great. - Really? - Yeah. - I was, um... Thanks, I was, I was going for casual chic. (laughs) - Tell you what, you nailed it. - Thanks. - So, uh... Are you here by yourself? Or, that's not what I mean. Does your husband also work for the royal family? - Oh, oh, no. He, uh, well, he, he used to, but he, he passed on. - Oh, sorry. No, I understand. My wife, she passed. - Oh. - I suppose you're pretty busy right now since you're working for the queen. Uh, do you need a break? - A break? Yes, I, I need a break. Do you need a break? I mean, uh, maybe we could, maybe you take your break when I take my break. - My shift just ended. (Queen laughs) - Good. - Okay, now it's my turn. - Go ahead. - Which great king said, "A kingdom governed by fear must collapse. But a kingdom guided by compassion will surely survive." - King Arthur. - No, your father, the late King James. - Oh, yeah, of course. I mean, he used to tell me that all the time. - He made that speech before you were born. - I saw it on video? - My Prince, there is- - All right, now it's my turn. You gotta try it. - Oh, I, I don't know if I could the, the smell. - Look, after the butler risked his life to smuggle this in here, you better give it a try, man. (tense menacing music) - Flat, smelly and greasy. - My lady. I can explain everything. - Not to worry, Baumgarten. I was referring only to the prince's hair. - Care to join us? Um, Baumgarten was just leaving. - I was just leaving. (Galina sighs) - How disgusting. Breaking bread with your servant. You don't have any class at all, do you? - Maybe that's what keeps you coming back for more. You're attracted to the bad boy in me. - Ha. Don't make me laugh. - Hey. You can play the ice princess all you want. I'm not impressed. (door slams) - Well, I never had anything that exciting happen with, with Edward except the time when he was a young boy and he thought he was a bird and he wanted to fly out of the window. - (laughs) Hope he didn't attempt it. - No, no, I just told him to wait 'til he was 16 and he'd get his own jet. (Johnny chuckles) - Yeah, yeah. - I, I was just kidding. - I know. (Queen laughs) - Uh, may I ask you something? - Anything. - What is mini-golf? (bright upbeat music) - So what brought on this drastic change in your, for lack of a better word, personality? - The smog. I think it causes temporary amnesia. - Sounds like an improvement. - Wow. You really don't dig me, do you? - If that assault on the English language means that I detest you, then yes, you are correct. - But why? I mean, look at all this cool stuff I got. And I'm a prince. I mean, doesn't everybody love a cool prince? - Okay. I will play along with your amnesia. One of the many reasons why I dislike you is because upon your 18th birthday, you and I are to be married. - Married? Like, married, married? - Not, like, married, married. Really married, married. (sighs) - How do you know you're gonna wanna get married? How do you know you're even gonna like me in a couple years? - My point, exactly. - Ah, and that's why you hate the prince. I, I mean me. - I hate being told what to do, how to act, what to think, and especially who to love. - Then why do you do it? - Because those are the ways of Gelfland royalty. The laws of Gelfland never change. - That's harsh. Who says that the laws of Gelfland can't change? - What do you mean? - Well, I'm saying let's slap down one of those laws right here, right now. - You can't be serious. Minister Kratski was adamant about- - I thought you didn't like being told what to do. - Is that a dare, Prince Edward? - You bet your sweet tiara. (bright ethereal music) (waves crashing) - What are you doing here? - Melissa, wait. - Get the hint. Leave me alone. - Earlier I was just trying to explain- - Go, get lost. - I am simply trying to explain why I'm acting differently. - I know why. Look, it doesn't matter how hard you hit yourself in the head. You can't just bring someone in closer to push them away again. Hey, what are you doing? Give me that. Give me that. - You, you drew those beautiful pictures? - Oh, not only does he use big words, now he's a keen sense of observation. - I, I did not know that you were an artist. - Yeah, well, add that to the list of stuff that nobody knows about Mel Hendrick. - Have you had arts instruction? - No, some things you learn by just doing. - Then making mistakes, that is part of the process. - I suppose so. - Then I want to learn the right things to say to you, Miss Mel. The things to make you smile, to help you realize what a wonderful young woman you are. - And I'm supposed to believe this? - Please believe it, because it is true. - And how long will this last? - Uh, I will not be in the city for much longer. - No, I know. You have to move on to bigger and better opportunities. What's going on with us? Why is everything changing between us? - As I told you, I'm not who you think I am. - Oh, please. - As you wish. - Would you just stand still a minute? (gentle bright music) (Queen and Johnny laugh) - It's a good- - After watching you play, give me a break. - It's a good thing we were not playing polo because you would be a dead man by now. (laughs) - Abby, I would love to take you someplace really special. A real date. No more corn dogs. I swear. Sorry. (Queen laughs) - I'd love that. - Yeah. All right. Well, I happen to know this great little restaurant. Really, it's, it's just right down here. It's on the beach. We could, uh, put our feet in the sand. Smell the ocean, listen to the waves. - That sounds so romantic. - Great. I'm off tomorrow night. - I'm, um, I'm leaving tomorrow night. - Tonight then. - You sure? - I'm, I've never been sure about anything like I am about this. I'll pick you up at your room tonight. - Great. - Great. - No, um, I'm gonna meet you right here tonight. - Listen, Abby, I'd feel much better if I... - I'll be here tonight. I wouldn't miss it. - Neither would I. (Queen laughs) (tense brooding music) (door creaks) - Hey, Vince, that you? Listen. I was wondering if I could start my shift an hour later tonight. - Now why is that, Mr. Canty? Got a hot date? - Uh... What are you doing here? - Just a little light reading about Queen Albertina of Gelfland. But I believe you know her better as, um, Abby. Abby. Such a ridiculously common name. But then again, that is her game. - What is this? What game? - Well, the queen is a bit, uh, restless, I'm afraid. With unlimited money and power at her disposal, she tends to get a bit bored. She lays that boredom by seeing how many unsuspecting men she can seduce by pretending to be someone else. Evidently, she likes to, as you Americans say, go slumming. In Rome, it was a garbage man. In Paris, a busboy, in Milan- - All right. That's enough. - What? No thank you? I just saved you a great deal of embarrassment and humiliation. - (sighs) Yeah. Yeah. And I'm sure you did it out of the goodness of your heart. (Kratski chuckles) - [Melissa] All your talk about opportunity and getting outta Palm Bay got me to thinking. - Really? - Yeah. It'd be great to go study art in Italy or Paris. - Wow, yes. Then that's what you should do. - (scoffs) Right. I'd have to work about 4,000 summers at El Burrito Queen to afford it. - There are other ways. You should not give up your dreams. - Dreams are great, but sometimes you gotta throw cold water on your face and realize you have to deal with the here and now. - But what if the dream is something you really want? - What can I say? Some fantasies are meant to stay fantasies. - Are you out of your mind, Canty? - What are you talking about? - What are we talking about? - Eddie the groundskeeper says you're fraternizing with the queen. (Johnny chuckles) - So? - So. So what are you trying to do? Start an international incident? - All right. All right. The first thing, I didn't know that it was, you know, the queen. Really. And second, uh... All right. I just made a mistake. It was a big mistake. - You got that right. - Meaning what? - Meaning you're fired. - You come anywhere near this resort, especially anywhere near Queen Albertina, and we will have you arrested my, friend. - I knew you were bad news the moment I laid eyes on you. - You're just not security guard material, are you? - No, you're right. Come here. I'm cop material. And after working with you guys, I'd have to say that's a compliment. Best compliment I've ever had. - I think he meant it. - Maybe he'll learn something. (suspenseful music) - Ow. (Galina laughs) - Where'd you get an arm like that? - My great aunt, the Duchess Moore had forearms like a lumberjack. (Cash grunts) (Galina giggles) (towel thwacking) (Cash grunting) - [Cash] All right, all right. Come on. (gentle pensive music) (gentle menacing music) - [Operator] Windsor Grand Estates. How may I address your call? - Yes, estate number five, please. - [Operator] Your name, sir? - Um, this, this is Prince Edward of Gelfland. Please ring my suite immediately. - No, you drop it, prince boy. - Oh, no, no. You drop it. (phone rings) No, you drop it. - I gotta get that. - Okay. Go and get it. - All right, But don't nail me while I'm doing it. - A ceasefire? - Yeah, sounds like a cool idea. - Are you questioning the word of a lady? - Prince's room? (towel thwacks) - Hello? Hello? - Hi. Who's this? - Cash? Is this you? - Uh, this is Prince Edward. - Oh, I see. Someone is there with you. Well, I must ask you, is life as a prince as you expected it to be? - It's a lot different than being a surfer. - Yes, so I've learned. - Edward. - It's, it's just Baumgarten. - It's just CT. - Edward, where are you? - Near the boardwalk with Miss Mel. - If Mel hears you call her miss, you're dead, man. - I shall keep that in mind. Cash, we, we should get together as soon as possible. - [Cash] Meet me here at the resort first thing tomorrow morning. - [Edward] All right, goodbye. (gentle brooding music) - Everything okay with Baumgarten? - What? Oh, yeah. Everything's cool. - A prince and a surfer then. We must not let them switch back. Locate Edward on the boardwalk and bring him to me by whatever means necessary. (tense menacing music) - Well, yeah. I better be going back to my suite, you know, before Constance pops a blood vessel or something. - Yeah, right. Galina. If I ever start acting different again, uh, just, um... - Just what? What are you saying? - Nothing. I just want you to keep having fun, being happy. It works for you. - Uh, you know that, that law about you and I getting married? - Yeah. - Edward. It's starting to sound like a cool idea. (gentle bright music) (gentle pensive music) - Well, I must go home now, Miss Mel. - Okay. What? - Nothing, um, I'm just drawing a memory. - Come here? - Yes. Goodbye. Oh, uh. Well, this must mean that my mother's found out. Well, not to worry. I was just on my way back to the resort. (tense menacing music) (Edward groans) Really, I can walk. (officer thuds) (tense suspenseful music) - Who are those guys? - It is difficult to explain. - Well, give it a try. - Well, Miss Mel, the truth is that... (tense brooding music) (clock ticking) - Waiting for someone, my Prince? Or would you rather be referred to as, uh, Cash Canty? - Kratski, that traitor. - We need a plan. - I can't believe him. - Get over it. - How could he do this to us? - Hey, snap out of it. - Astonishing. You are truly physically indistinguishable from Prince Edward. - Yeah, uh, well, you don't have to worry about it anymore, Kratski. It's over. - [Kratski] Oh, is it? - What do you want? - Well, I admit it. I admit it. I'm impressed. Who would ever imagine a simple young American surfer boy could devise such an elaborate, uh, political conspiracy? - Whoa, man. It was just meant to be a joke. It was just for fun. - Oh, a game? - Yeah, a game. And now it's done. - Yes, but, uh, it doesn't have to be. Please, try it on. Go ahead. Humor me. You see, games always have winners and losers, but with your ingenuity and your ambition, there's no reason why you shouldn't be a winner too. Please, sit. This trade agreement will save Gelfland. But I require the signature of the queen and a prince. And in a pinch, any prince will do. - What about Edward? - Oh, actually I spoke to him this morning. It seems our prince wishes to remain here in America, right where he is. (Cash laughs) - Uh, I don't know, Krats. It seems like the real prince should be signing this. - As far as I'm concerned, the real prince is sitting in front of me now. - You want me to move to Gelfland? - Yes. With riches beyond your imagination. And Galina will be with you forever. And no one, no one will ever have to know your true identity. - Wait... Funlimited. This isn't an agreement. It's a sell out. I won't do it. I won't betray my friends just to make myself rich. And I especially won't do it to make you rich. - You, uh, you refuse to sign? - Yeah. (Kratski clears throat) - Well, then. What about this? - Oh, where'd you get that? - You have a friend I believe, by the name of Mel. - Where is she? - Oh, not to worry. She's under my care. But if you wish to see her alive again, you will sign that document right here and right now. - If you hurt her- - Oh, hurt her. (laughs) We're practically on Gelfland soil here. I can hurt anybody I wish. - You sent for me, Minister? - Anybody. The prince is signing the trade agreements between Gelfland and the American Consortium. By Gelfland law, we require a witness. (gentle suspenseful music) Thank you. (Cash sighs) Excellent. You may go now, Baumgarten. Call the chairman at Funlimited. Set the meeting at the 13th hole of the mini-golf course. - You're not returning to Gelfland, are you? - I see no reason to continue wasting my talent as a statesman playing nursemaid to ungrateful royalty. - So becoming a traitor's the next best thing, huh? - No. Success is the best revenge, Mr. Canty. And when I receive my $10 million from Funlimited, perhaps I shall buy myself a small island somewhere and, uh, run it myself. If he misbehaves, appropriate discipline. - Ma'am? - My Queen. I must request a moment of your time. - What is it, Minister? - Just a few more documents for your signature. - All right. - There. Mm-hm. Thank you. And right there. Very good. Oh, and, uh, just this one more, please. - Funlimited? What is this? - Huh. Yes, well, that would be the, uh, rental agreement for the resort. It's a mere formality. - Of course. - It's such fun. - [Baumgarten] How does the game work, Lady Galina? - Come on, Edward, show me what you got. - Galina, I don't think that's such a great idea. (object thuds) (officer thuds) (Galina chuckles) That was great you, guys. - I don't know exactly what's going on. - Who cares? - I'll explain everything later. First we gotta stop Kratski from delivering the contract to Funlimited. Do you guys know if the queen has signed the contract yet? - I could ask Constance. - Find her. - Yes. - Find Albertina. Tell her not to sign the contract. - Check. - Kratksi's mine. (phone rings) - Security. Oh my god. - Trouble? - Somebody just spotted Canty in building four. - He's going after the queen. - This is a level one security alert. You ready? (device beeps) Be careful out there. - You are making a big mistake, Minister. - By the time anyone realizes what has happened, I will be long gone and $10 million richer. And you, you and your pathetic royal clan, you will be without a country. - Who is this guy? - I am not the same Edward as I was before. - Oh, you mean you're even more of a wuss, hm? (chuckles) Come on, now. (gentle suspenseful music) Hurry up, you idiots. (tense menacing music) (Mel sighing) - That guy has some anger issues he needs to work out. - I'm am not a wuss. Mom? Cash? Hello, any- - Hey, wait, what is going on? - I can explain everything later but now's- - No, now. - Not the time though. I'm sorry. - Are you pretending to like me too? One second you're Cash and the next minute you're the prince. - Albertina? Excuse me, have you seen- Edward! - Ma'am. - I'm gonna find out what he's up to. Get Baumgarten. - Right away, Ma'am. - Galina. - Who is she? - Who is she? - I can explain everything. - How dare you. - Galina, wait, please. Um, I'm sorry. We are to be married. - Wait, what? (suspenseful music) - Hello? (bright playful music) - Come on. Open the gate. - I thought you had the keys. - Don't mess with me like that. - Yeah, we're gonna need the key. - Come on. (suspenseful music) - Did you see Albertina? (fist thuds) You could have just said no. - Wait a minute. How, how did you get out here so fast? And why were you wearing those clothes? - Albertina. Look, I'll explain everything later. - You'll explain everything right this minute. - My Prince, where are you going? - Galina, what is wrong? (suspenseful music) - Galina, Cash. - Wait. - Is it me, or is something really, really strange going on here? - It's not you. (tense suspenseful music) - Hello. Excuse me. (gentle playful music) - Well, looks like we finally have the place all to ourselves. (tense suspenseful music) - Mr. Chairman. (chuckles) I have something for you and, uh, you have something for me. - Hey. - It is not a good idea to startle someone when they're about to mount an attack. - An attack? - Yes. - Edward, I demand you tell me what is going on. - Galina, do you trust me? - Stop. What are you doing, Minister Kratski? - Why, saving Gelfland, my Queen. - I don't believe you. - He's trying to save himself, your Highness. He wants to sell your country out to the highest bidder so they can tear it up and use it for a cheesy golf resort. - Traitor. - Ridiculous. He's lying. - He speaks the truth, mother. Minister Kratski's betrayed us all. He's nothing but a criminal. - Abby. - Johnny. - Will you excuse me? Abby, you and I, we need to talk. - Oh, I, I would love to talk to you. - What's going on? - Go get them, you nit wits. - My father taught me that it is not sporting to attack an unarmed man. Hey, get off me. (grunting) - Without my intervention, the collapse of Gelfland was inevitable. I was merely making the best of a bad situation. - You are merely a common thief. (tense suspenseful music) - Pardon me. (slap thuds) Never mess with a lady. - Hey, didn't you hear what he said about not attacking an unarmed man? (blow cracks) (Mel grunts) - Farewell, my Queen. - Abby, fore, fore him. (Kratski groans) (balls thud) Pretty good. - Fools. I asked them for Gelfland bills. They gave me Golf Land balls. (gentle sanguine music) - Edward? - Cash. - Cash? - Edward. - Wow. - There are two of them. - Two of them. - Two. (gentle bright music) (group chattering softly) (Kratski shouting) - [Narrator] So that's the story. Cash married Lady Galina, and after they both graduated from Stanford University with honors, they opened a special nationwide chain of surf shops. They became Gelfland's biggest trading partner and even opened up the first ever Gelfland surf shop. After high school, Melissa traveled with Edward and studied in Europe and stuff, and they opened Gelfland's first ever art museum. And on her 21st birthday, check this out, Melissa married Prince Edward and she started getting called Princess Melissa. Cool. And finally Johnny Canty married Queen Albertina, or Queen Abby as he called her, 'cause that was, like, a nickname that he had for her. And he moved to Gelfland and he became Chief Constable. Yeah. Whatever that is. And they did indeed, my little grummies, live happily ever after. Oh, one more thing. Minister Kratski, he was finally in charge of his own kingdom, passing out little short pencils and putters. (laughs) Righteous. That's it.
