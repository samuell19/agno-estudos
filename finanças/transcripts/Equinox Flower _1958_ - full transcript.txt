Lots of newly weds about Not a lot of pretty brides though See that one on the 15-minutes-past to Atami? That chubby one? She was nice, the prettiest one so far I wonder if the weather will hold. There was a storm warning April showers bring May flowers Hey, here comes another If you ask me, she's too skinny Warning: Strong Winds ... we pray that you may be blessed... I haven't seen Mr Mikami What happened to Mikami? I don't think he came I sent him an invitation, but he didn't show up Why not? Now let us hear from a close friend of the father of the bride... ...Mr Wataru Hirayama, company director of Daiwa Enterprises ls that me? Please be seated Congratulations, Tomoko The previous speakers have all said wonderful things... ...and there isn't much I can add These two have been in love for a long time Every once in a while, I would hear from Tomoko... ...how their relationship was going It was always good news However, I was always surprised... ...by how very different their lives were from my own youth I remember how plain and unsentimental... ...my own wedding was My wife is sitting right here... ...and she too could tell you... ...how it was all arranged by our parents In that regard, our young couple today is very lucky I truly envy them My only advice to them is to try their best to find happiness... ...though they may already know that I hope people tell me about your ideal marriage one day... ...so I can envy you even more Thank you Congratulations - Thank you - It was my pleasure Wakamatsu Restaurant What year was that? I think it was in 1942 or 1943. I passed by Kure, returning home Was Mikami still there? His shipboard duty was later He took me to the Officers' Club. His treat He'd reached his peak then He still had a few good years in him Have some more Hasn't Mikami's daughter reached marriageable age? Yes, she's a year younger than mine - The girl I saw you with today? - No, that was my eldest I see What about your daughter? She's at that age Most of us have had girls - You have boys, don't you? - Two sons I heard that if the husband is the stronger, then the couple will have girls... ...and if the wife is stronger, they'll have boys, right? The first child is usually a girl Does that mean the man is stronger early on in the marriage? - It's possible - It's odd in your case, then - How come? - Because you have two boys You should ask my wife. I'm not a very passionate man Rubbish! Welcome It's just like a reunion. Welcome. Welcome - It's been a while, hasn't it? - Indeed Congratulations, Mr Kawai. The wedding went well? I'm glad the weatherman was wrong about the strong winds Won't you get a bit lonely, now that your daughter is married? I'm used to it, second time round - How many do you have? - How many what? Husbands? I mean how many children? Oh, children. I've got three - I bet they're all boys - That's right. How did you know? We can just tell. It's obvious - No doubt about it - Wouldn't be right otherwise - What do you mean? - You have the constitution for it - More sake - Yes, yes. You're up to something... Welcome home Welcome back Where did you go afterwards? To Wakamatsu Mrs Kawai must've been lonely, left all by herself - Where's Setsuko? - Still out She's not home yet? It's getting late It was a lovely reception, and the bride was beautiful Her bridal kimono was so beautiful - Have you spoken to Setsuko yet? - Yes What did she say? She didn't say anything. She just grinned She should think about it - I know, but still... - Time is of the essence He's a fine young man. She should make a decision I suppose so He's from a good family, too According to Takanashi... ...his grandfather used to be President of the Yokohama Chamber of Commerce ls that so? He was very prominent Is this about Setsuko's marriage? - There's no need to rush it - What do you mean? I'm sure my sister has her own thoughts on the subject, just as I do You do? I'd hate having an arranged marriage with someone I didn't know ls that so? I'd hate it! That worries me... You've no need to worry. I can find a husband on my own ls that right? That's good to know Well, find a good one, Hisako No problem. I have plenty of boyfriends Is that so? Sister? I'm home. Shall I lock the door? Sure. That's all right, isn't it? Evening - Welcome home - You're late - I was out with a friend - On a date? Don't be silly! How did the bride look, Mother? - She looked beautiful - Really? They smell nice I bet my sister has one - One what? - A boyfriend I don't know. Does she? I'm not sure, but I reckon so Well, then, I don't have to worry about her either You'd worry about us anyway - Good night - Night - You'll need your morning suit again tomorrow - What for? Don't you have the funeral of a colleague? Oh, a suit and a black tie will do It's so confusing, one day a wedding, the next day a funeral Yes? Mr. Mikami is here I thought I'd pop in. I'm not bothering you, I hope No, not at all Why didn't you come to the wedding yesterday? I had to excuse myself - Anything the matter? - No, nothing serious Not really - What was the matter? - I just didn't want to go Why? What happened? I just wasn't in the mood for a happy wedding - Why not? - I was thinking of my daughter We were talking about that yesterday. What happened to your daughter? Did someone mention her? It was just that all of our daughters were of marriageable age Fumiko's left home Why? When? About two months ago She's living with a man Really? I didn't know that I don't know what to do with her. It's partly my fault, of course... How's she supporting herself? I heard she has a flat in Suginami and she's working in a bar in the Ginza Have you heard of a place called Luna? Luna? No, I've never heard of it I can't just go and see her like that If you get a chance, will you check on her? Of course I will. But what happened? Yes? Mrs Sasaki of Kyoto is here to see you - Sasaki? - Yes Excuse me You've got a customer, so I'll get going You don't have to leave I'll come again. Thanks All right - I'll see you soon - See you again - Goodbye - Thanks. Bye My, it's been a long time - Indeed it has. Have a seat - Thank you - When did you arrive? - Yukiko and I got here yesterday I see It's been such a long time. How's the family? How's Hisako? We're all well. Thanks for the bamboo shoots They weren't very good, I'm so embarrassed Matsu and I eventually figured out what happened We divided the guests at our Kyoto inn into two categories We meant to send you the good quality shoots... ...but by the time we realised our mistake, it was too late, they'd turned into bamboo! I was just telling Matsu about the terrible mix-up We would've sent you some good ones, but they'd all become bamboo trees! - I don't need bamboo trees - Of course, they're no use to anyone - Why have you come to Tokyo? - Me? - Yes - Because ofYukiko What about her? I'll tell you the whole story. It's like this... Yukiko won't take my advice. We're constantly arguing - What about? - Marriage I see. Well, congratulations! No, nothing's set yet You know that doctor from the Tsukiji market? - I don't know him - He stays at ours when he comes to Kyoto I'm guessing you send him the good bamboo shoots I certainly do. You've never seen him at our inn? Is he a prospect for marriage? No, not him. Pay attention! He's over 60 years old, much too old for Yukiko - Then who is it? - His assistant who's also a doctor - That's good - That doctor is young and very kind When he stayed at our inn, he took such good care of... - OfYukiko? - No, no! He treated me - You remember my chronic disease? - What was it again? - I'm not taking too much of your time, am I? - I'm actually rather busy Really? I do apologise It might be my heart I suddenly feel it tighten up and I have difficulty breathing I feel I'm dying This young doctor told me to get a full physical... ...but I'm scared of what they might do to me I'm even scared of the drill at the dentist I almost faint when I see it approaching I always end up rushing home Goodness knows what I'll be like during the healthcare check-ups... - Hold on - What is it? I need to go to the toilet Go ahead Or maybe I should leave - Take your time - All right, then - Serve some tea in the reception room - Yes - Should I wait? - No, you can go - Is anybody home? - Yes Welcome! I'm Yukiko Sasaki from Kyoto Just a moment - Hello. It's good to see you - Hello Come in Thank you - Where is everyone? - They all go shopping on Sundays Oh, I see Come on in You'll like the other room better You must be a second-rate customer Yes, you should give me bad bamboo shoots! That's right - There... - Thank you Miss Tomizawa, bring some tea. And cakes ifyou've got any Yes, sir I have a gift for you Thank you Did your mother go into hospital? Yes, she finally decided to go - Did she make a fuss? - Yes, the night before she was admitted... ...she went on about how she didn't know what to do... ...and how she wanted to cancel the appointment and go home - She wouldn't listen to anything I said - But you persuaded her? She was being completely irrational, so I told her... ..."Mother, I'm worried about your health, so do this or I'll leave home" So she finally listened to me - That must've been hard - I had to be firm with her There are good hospitals in Kyoto, too I know. This is just mother's little set-up - Set-up? - Yes - There you go - Thanks! It's so different from Kyoto, even the colour of the sky What's this 'set-up'? She must've told you about my marriage? Yes, she said something about a young doctor at the hospital I know exactly what she's thinking She gets hospitalised, so I visit her everyday... ...and then she sets me up with the doctor! I can see right through her! And? What do you think of this doctor? I'm not interested in him at all Then I feel sorry for your mother Yes, but this is for her health I suppose it is. What will you do in the meantime? I'm going shopping and then heading back to Kyoto - You're leaving your mother? - Yes That's a bit cruel! I need to take drastic measures to stop her... ...from constantly trying to choose my husband. I can't take it anymore! I see It's just constant. Anyway, I don't want to leave Matsu alone at the inn Do you have someone in your life already? No, I don't - You shouldn't rush to get married - That's so true I mean it. What first looks like gold might turn out to be brass once you're married Really? Brass, you say? That's right You don't need to get married just yet Why should every girl rush to get married? Why not be different? You've no plans for Setsuko to marry? In a way, I do Regardless, a pretty girl like you shouldn't hurry to marry What time will the others be back? They didn't say When they get back, I'll tell Setsuko to visit you tomorrow Yes, I'd love to see her It's such a lovely day It's time for your medicine This tastes awful! What is it? - There's sulphur in it - Really? What good does that do? - Do I have to finish it? - Yes I'd rather not. ls she here yet? - Your daughter? - Yes - No, not yet - Where is she? She's late She's only visited me once this morning Mother's room is right there Really? Have you met this doctor? Yes, briefly - What's he like? - I'm not interested in him It was mother's idea. So annoying. But what about you? - What? - Any plans to marry you off? No, not really. Father's interested, that's all Really? I wish they'd stop putting us through this - Is Auntie that persistent? - It's all she talks about The other day, a man with a tuxedo and a white scarf walked past us Mother asked if I fancied him for a husband So I turned round to look at him... ...and I saw an advert for a nightclub on his back! I envy you, though, Setsuko Your parents aren't like my mother. They're so understanding I wouldn't be so sure of that They're not like my mother at all She always goes on and on... ...and she never gets to the point But she has an interesting way of talking Yes, too interesting, if you ask me! Setsuko, we should team up What do you mean? You help me when my mother's being unreasonable... ...and I'll do the same for you - Sounds good - I'm relying on you Promise? What was that? It means, 'Thirteen silver hairpins, three broken spider webs...' - It's a spell - I see. In that case... Thank you - Should I wait? - No, you can go Good day - Excuse me! - Yes? I'm so happy to see you again Welcome. Please come in May I? I hope I'm not bothering you Not at all. Do come in Thank you - Here... - Thank you - Welcome, madam - Hello. Sorry for dropping in on you like this I brought this as a small present Thank you very much - It's for the family, not for you - I know, madam - Sorry... - Are you busy with something? I knew we'd talk at length, so I went to the bathroom Oh, I see Well, now... Is Hisako at school? Yes. And Setsuko's now working They're both lovely girls Yukiko returned home without me So you're having some healthcare check-ups, I hear Oh, let me tell you, it's such an awful place They sent electricity through wires around my hands and feet... ...and injected me with some kind of blue ink, can you believe? It turned my urine blue! It was horrible, just horrible! That's not all. I had to drink this disgusting, muddy substance It tasted awful I was supposed to stay three more days, but I couldn't take it So you didn't finish your treatment? No, I don't need them prodding and poking me anymore I couldn't bear it! And what about your heart? The old doctor told me it was fine. He said it was just neurosis I told him I still have pains, but he wouldn't listen to me - Isn't that outrageous? - I'm glad it was nothing serious I didn't need to come all the way to Tokyo - It's always better to be sure - Yes, I suppose so And what about the young doctor? - He's the one I'm talking about! - What do you mean? He's the one who injected the blue ink. I begged him to stop He said it was necessary despite my protestations He was so cruel. I really dislike him I see. And you were trying to matchmake him... Well, I'll find another prospect for her. You must help me I'll do my best I'm doing all I can... ...but Yukiko just keeps telling me to leave her alone and not bother her Children are so ungrateful Our children are the same. It's the same everywhere You think? If we wait too long, Yukiko will never get married She'll find someone. She's capable and pretty, too - You really think so? - I do You're right. In fact, I already have another prospect lined up Who is he? He's not a doctor, but it's close enough - What does he do? - He's a pharmacist He is the second son of an important pharmacist in Osaka He's a bit old, though. I can't remember if he's 24 or 25 years old He graduated from Osaka University. Maybe this will be the one You certainly have a lot of candidates! This one's ideal, I'm telling you Hold on, I'm just going to the bathroom Please do Oh, this way! Oh, that's right You're sure I'm not bothering you? Don't go too far, it's dangerous! We'll be fine! The weather is so nice When was the last time we did this? The weather's lovely Maybe I should go for a game You mean golf? Please, not today This may be the last time we can all go out together... ...if Setsuko gets married You're right But we can all go out again before she marries But you're always too busy Why does she just grin at me without saying anything? Who? You mean Setsuko? I was the same at her age Times have changed, though Shall I go ahead with what we were talking about? Yes, I suppose it's all right I feel good - I was thinking... - What? Remember how we used to run to the air-raid shelters... ...when the planes came during the war? Setsuko had just started primary school Hisako had just started walking In the dark, we used to think we might all die together I remember I hated the war... ...but sometimes I miss those days when we were all much closer Don't you? No. Those were the years I hated the most We had nothing to our name, surrounded by arrogant fools But those were good days for me We were always together, the four of us Are you complaining because I've been coming home late? It's not that But we don't even get to have supper as a family anymore Everyday it gets busier at work But at least we can lead a more comfortable life Even so... What are you saying? It's nothing I had trouble yesterday at Bunker 7. I just couldn't get out I've also had difficulties there I went to Hakone with my family yesterday That sounds very nice - So how was Hakone? - I spent the whole day with my family It must feel good to do that from time to time Indeed Yes? What is it? - This person is asking to see you - Right... Very well, bring him in Yes, sir Come in My name is Taniguchi I'm Hirayama The Nitto Chemical Company? My daughter works there Well... What can I do for you? Well... - I wish to marry your daughter - Excuse me? I'd like your consent - You...? - Yes - Is Setsuko aware of this? - She is I should've asked you through an intermediary... - ...but I don't have a lot of time - Time? My company is transferring me... ...and I wanted to get your consent before I go This is all very sudden - I apologise - I can't give you an answer right now I have to discuss this with Setsuko Let's leave it at that for now Please give it your consideration - Oh, hello - Hello Here's the quote from Hill Enterprises Just leave it here You knew nothing about this? No, she never said anything to me It's a problem I'm home - What is it? - Come here Sit down - What is it? - Do you know a man named Taniguchi? - Yes - He came by my office today - Did you know about that? - No He said he wants to marry you How do you know him? - From work - How long have you known him? Do you intend to marry him? Answer me Yes, I wish to marry him Why didn't you say anything? Why didn't you consult with me or your mother? You knew we were making arrangements Well, I don't approve of this fellow - But I ... - What? Why can't I find happiness on my own? Setsuko! I'll find happiness on my own! - Where are you going? - I'm going out Setsuko! Hi. What's up? Come in Why did you go see my father without telling me? - Why didn't you tell me? - I thought it'd be better that way Why? I didn't want to cause you any worry What worry? I told you before, I would tell my mother and then she'd tell my father I know, I considered that, too - The result would've been the same - How so? Your father and mother could only answer either yes or no I'd know sooner if I asked them directly You know I'm being transferred to Hiroshima I heard That's why I went to see your father And what if my father says no? I've already made up my mind - Have you? - Do you need to ask? I'm not leaving you Well, then, we've got nothing to fear That's how it should be Everything's fine now It's late, you should go. Let me take you home Come on - Good night - Night - Bye - Thanks I just came to take her home - Thank you - Good night ls she back home? Setsuko! Yes? Sit down Where've you been? Don't you think you're being rather careless? You think you can make such a decision without consulting us first? Don't you think you're making a mistake? Answer me Say something! - Don't get angry - I'm not talking to you! What's going on, Setsuko? I'm trying to spare you an unhappy marriage I want to protect you from anything that would make you unhappy Do you really know this Taniguchi fellow? - I do - And you think he'll make a good husband? Yes, I do He's not from a distinguished family as you would have liked... ...but I don't think that's any reason to make me unhappy Well, I don't agree That's just the way you see things Setsuko! My opinions are different. I see things my own way What opinions? Explain them to me Even if I did, I don't think you'd understand - What's that? - Setsuko! Mother! You two were lucky from the start We might not have the chance to have the kind of life father has in mind But we don't care. It won't make us unhappy We will take responsibility for our own lives And we won't be a burden on either ofyou Even so, Setsuko... Enough! I've had enough! You're still young, Setsuko A lot can happen in life You two are in love. That may be enough for now... ...but who knows what the future will bring? There's a lot that you need to consider You said that we were lucky... ...but it wasn't always like that for your father and me We went through some very difficult times That's why your father is so concerned Do you understand? Promise me you'll think it over Enough now! Anyway, I'm opposed to it The young make trouble as soon as they leave home You'll stay home two or three days and think it over! - I have to go to work - You'll do as I say! You don't have to go You should go to bed now She's such a worry Even so... ...Taniguchi looks like a good man And when did you meet him? Just before, when he brought Setsuko back And you can judge him after meeting him once? Don't be ridiculous! Anyway, I won't give my consent - You called me? - Yes, come here I didn't take you away from your work? No - You were free? - Yes. I mean no... No, I guess not - There's something I want to ask you - Yes, sir? A fellow called Taniguchi came to see me yesterday. How well do you know him? - He was above me at school - I see He's two years older than me, and played basketball I see. And what else? - ls that all? - We worked in the same office one summer You did? Where? - It was at a warehouse in Hakozaki - I see... Mr Mikami is here for you Show him in - We'll talk later - Yes, sir - Thanks - Thank you, sir - Sorry to bother you again - Not at all I don't want to be a nuisance, but have you had a chance yet? Have you been to Luna? I've been a bit preoccupied. I haven't had a chance yet I see There's no need to rush, of course. I'm just a little worried I'll go tonight You will? I'd appreciate it Children can be a handful Maybe it's because we spoil them. But what can we do? It's a strange situation ... Welcome It's been a while, Mr Kondo. How have you been? Over here will do fine Welcome Welcome. What can I serve you? One highball Yes, sir. How about you, Mr Kondo? The same, right? Make it two So you know this place? Yes. No... They all seem to know you Why didn't you say so? We would've found this place in no time I apologise. I didn't think this was the place you meant Where else? There can't be that many bars with the same name around here You're right, sir. I apologise Is there a Fumiko working here? Her last name is Mikami We call her Kaoru. She'll be back in a moment There you go, sir. And one for Mr Kondo Why so quiet tonight? - Drink up - Ah, thank you, sir That Taniguchi, what's he like? He's two years older than me, and plays basketball You said that already Well, he played offence, and he had a good lay-up technique No. I mean, his personality? - His character - He's a good man What do you mean "good"? I don't know him that well, but he seems like a nice guy You worked with him. How was he? He worked at a desk, and I was just the delivery guy - So you don't know him very well at all - No, I don't - Why didn't you say that from the start? - Sorry, sir Oh, Kaoru. She's back What is it? - Are you Fumiko? - Yes Do you remember me? I'm Mr Hirayama, a friend of your father Let's have a seat It's been a while since I last saw you Indeed - How are you? - Fine - Did my father tell you I was working here? - Yes. I was curious to see how you were doing Well ... ... I just want to be left alone No, I'm not here for that Can we talk somewhere more private? - What do you want to talk about? - Well, can't we talk somewhere more private? I can't leave right now I understand. I'll wait until you finish your shift. ls that okay? Where's your usual liveliness? What's up with you? What is it? Don't act so familiar. That man's my boss - Then you can drink all you want - It's not like that - Want another one? - Not tonight Go away. Leave me alone - Lost your spirit? - Shut up, you idiot! I'll get you for this - Welcome! - Welcome! Thank you So, do you always wait for him around this time? Yes. He'll be here soon We always go home together He's in a cabaret band, you said? Yes He plays piano He studied at music school I see. What do you think about your father? My father? I feel sorry for him, but he's just so stubborn - Stubborn? - He's stuck in his ways - Too much so - Too much so? He makes no effort to understand. He thinks his way is the only way Really? ls that what you think? Yes, it is Father has to have everything his own way - I'm sure it's not like that - No, it is Maybe it's just because he worries about you Well, he shouldn't worry about me But he does. What about you? Are you happy? Me personally? I'm happy. I don't see myself as unfortunate at all I see Welcome! He's here - This is... - Pleased to meet you. I'm Naganuma Hello. How do you do? It's getting late. We'lI head home Fine. Thank you for coming - Bye - Goodbye Hold on a moment Here's some spending money I can't accept this - It isn't much - I just can't. I'm sorry Welcome home Where were you? I went to see Mikami's daughter Oh, Fumiko? How is she? She's managing somehow, but it's not right... Did Setsuko stay home today? Yes. What are we going to do about her? Leave her alone for a while Soon she'll realise what she's asking Are you still up? Yes, I couldn't sleep Setsuko! - Did you...? - What? Did you sleep with him? Father, you should have a little more trust in me He's not that kind of man Tell her to think it over. Tell her not to go to work She can even leave her job Keep an eye on her and don't let her go out I will not allow this kind of behaviour ... ... or a wedding You understand? Nightgown - Welcome! - Welcome! Why were you so quiet the other night? Do you know how nervous I was, you idiot? You were sweating like a pig It's hot in here. This place needs air-conditioning - Mr Kondo, what would you like? - A highball with water - Same as last time? - I can't afford a brand like that My usual brand. Cheap, not that expensive stuff - Right? - Right, let the boss treat you to the good stuff Don't talk rubbish! He won't be back here again, no way Hey, Kaoru ... How does your father know my boss? They went to school together What does he do now? - He works for a printing company - He came to see my boss yesterday Really? Did you hear anything? They were talking, but I wasn't in the room for very long Sorry to keep you waiting Now, that tastes good! It tastes better when I pay for it myself, even if it is the cheap stuff Eh? How come I get no peanuts? - You're much livelier tonight - Of course Last night was an exception. Where are my peanuts? Don't be so stingy Don't get pompous, or your boss might come back Don't scare me like that. He won't come back to a dump like this Give me my peanuts! - Welcome! - Welcome! - Welcome and thank you for the other night - Not at all Welcome Oh, you're here again? - You must be a regular - Yes. Well, no ... Your father came to see me yesterday He asked me to give you this since he doesn't know your address Your father would like to see you. What do you say? It's no use meeting Really? Well, just think it over Goodbye Bye You can sit down again now Unbelievable! How did you know he was coming? That's ruined the taste of my highball Give me a match - Ever been to the Luna Bar? - Yeah, last night Well, be careful ... ... the boss is a patron - You saw him there? - Yes Hello? Miss Sasaki? Put her through Yukiko? You're back in Tokyo? When did you arrive? My advice? What about? I'll come see you on the way home All right. Bye You have a visitor, madam Thank you for coming - What's going on, then? - Well... - How's your mother doing? - That's what I want to talk about - What's the matter? - Well...I can't take any more of it What's wrong? Have you had an argument? You can tell me She's being so unreasonable That's why I left Left? I'm not sure what you mean - I ran away from home - Without telling your mother? Yes Well, that's not good, is it? There you are What on earth were you arguing about? Mother just won't listen to a word I say About what? I'll tell you the whole story Please do The thing is... ... I've found a man I love I see. And? - Mother doesn't approve of him - Why not? She always wants things to go her way But this time, I'm not going to give in I've made a promise to him What's this man like? I've known him for quite a while ... ... but mother's decided she wants me to marry some pharmacist from Osaka She says he's from a proper family with a lot of money She insists I marry him. She just tells me to do as she says She keeps telling me that Osaka is on the way up Listen, it's not funny Mother told Matsu to buy me fried bean curd for tomorrow ... ... and she said I should go to Fushimi Shrine to give thanks to Inari the fox god Did you go? Why would I? It's ridiculous What happened then? Mother was very angry at me because I rejected such an attractive prospect She told me I'd receive divine punishment from the fox god She was absolutely furious, so I left home - That makes a lot of leftover bean curd - Mother and Matsu are eating it now I imagine the guests at the inn must be eating it, too! Really? What a carry-on! I don't have to do what mother says, do I? - Not at all - I don't have to listen to her - Right - It's my future, isn't it? That's right So I guess I can marry the man I love Is he dependable? Then you should do it. It's your responsibility I know Forget what your mother's telling you You really think so? I'm so happy to hear that It's not like you to be so confused I wasn't confused. I've got to make a call - To whom? - I'm calling your house to tell Setsuko Why? Uncle ... That whole story, I made it all up. It was a trick - A trick? - Yes, it was all a set-up I'm going to tell Setsuko that you consent to her marriage Hey, wait a minute! Welcome home. I didn't hear you come in It's all turned out well, really well I don't know what I would've done... ... if Setsuko had done the same as Mikami's daughter. I'm so relieved You're a very good father. Thank you - What? - Setsuko is so happy to have your consent - To what? - To marry Taniguchi I haven't yet given my consent But she just got a call from Yukiko That was her own doing But ... - I had no say in the matter - I see... If that's how you feel, it's good enough What you mean, "good enough"? - I mean about Setsuko - I refuse to take responsibility for that She and Taniguchi will take responsibility. She told you that - I can't take their word for it - But... But what? How long have you been conspiring with Taniguchi? Conspiring, you say? You have been conspiring! Did you really meet Taniguchi only once? No, he came over after I met him that night What? Why didn't you say anything? Because you've been in a foul mood and Setsuko asked me not to let him meet you Meeting him once or twice isn't enough. And what about Takanashi? You'll have to decline his offer No, I won't do it You're the one consenting, so you decline. I won't be held responsible for this Fine, I'll do it Then do it. I wash my hands of this whole affair I don't approve, so I won't be present at the wedding either You have to be there, at least at the wedding No! I won't go! I see. Then I won't go either You can go. You gave your consent - I won't go - Do as you wish! I'm sure the two of them will manage fine How do you mean? How do you expect me to know? This just goes to prove how irresponsible you're being You make all kinds of irresponsible statements Don't make promises you can't keep. It's wrong And what about you? What? What are you saying? Enough - Tell me! - Enough's enough If you have something to say, say it! You always have to have your way in everything Like what? As usual, you're being completely inconsistent regarding Setsuko - Inconsistent? - Yes You said you wouldn't mind Setsuko having a boyfriend ... ...but now that she has one, you disapprove. Don't you think that's strange? No, I don't. That's parental love. You call it being inconsistent? Yes, I call it inconsistent! If you really loved her, you would take responsibility Doing otherwise would be inconsistent Then everybody's inconsistent, apart from the gods! The world is full of inconsistencies And all these inconsistencies are what make up life And what about you? You're inconsistent, too! I'm home - I'm back - Where's your sister? - Did Setsuko go out? - Yes - Where to? - She's helping Taniguchi pack for Hiroshima How did you know he was leaving? I thought you'd given your consent when Setsuko called I said she wasn't allowed to go out Hisako went with her - But I left early to come home - Why? I felt like I was in the way They're not being lovey-dovey or anything, but they're clearly in love Taniguchi is such a nice man. He's like a big brother They'll be fine, Father. You shouldn't worry The train leaves tomorrow at 6:30pm. I'll be there with my sister Stop that noise! Turn it off! - When did you get here? - A while ago. I've been waiting - You've been here since yesterday? - Yes - How's the game? - Well ... not so good I see Your wife came by last night. She told me about your girl's wedding Congratulations - My wife came to see you? - She asked me to be the intermediary - For whom? - For your daughter, at the wedding Oh, I see - I was told you didn't approve - Right - So you're not coming to the wedding? - Right You don't have to. I'll take care of it It's hard to see your girl you've brought up leave home - That's not it - I heard. But this is the way it's got to be I'll take good care of it, all right? I'm still not coming Then don't. Don't force yourself to be there - Then it's settled - Right So that's everything taken care of Oh, yes, we're planning a school reunion. What do you think? - About what? - About having a school reunion Some people are coming to join us at Gamagori Will you come along? - Sure - It's been a long time I guess I'll go play a quick game. Want to join me? I'm going to take a breather. I'm tired All right See you - A beer - Yes, sir Hello? Hello? Futaba Beauty Parlour? This is the Hirayama residence Hirayama Yes, that's right. Can you get there an hour early tomorrow? That's right. The ceremony starts at 2:00pm sharp Okay? We're relying on you I called the beauty parlour. They'll be there on time Thank you. Come have some celebratory food with us Thank you, madam - Father's late. Where is he? - He's probably busy at work But I told him this morning to come home early ... ... tomorrow is Setsuko's wedding It's okay, sister I don't understand why he won't eat with us tonight Your father has his concerns, and he's dealing with them his way He's hired a private investigator to check up on Taniguchi I saw his report Aren't you going to eat that? I wasn't able to do much for you... ...but tell me if you need anything and I'll send it to you later I already have enough, Mother. You don't need to send anything Our new place is going to be fairly small No matter how small, there's no place like home You probably have a lot to take care of. You can go upstairs if you want Our visit to Hakone was our last outing as a family I'd hoped we'd have more We could've had more if father had wanted to Hisako! It's okay, Setsuko. You can get Mr Taniguchi to take you places Isn't Miyajima close to where you'll live? Maybe I'd love to go, too You should visit us during the summer Really? I'd love that - Really, I'll come - Setsuko, you should go now Night Listen, Mother, I heard Setsuko crying last night I woke up in the night... ...and when I asked her why she was crying, she just turned off the light I see It's father's fault. Why does he dislike Taniguchi? There aren't many kind men like him around Father's too old-fashioned! Welcome home Welcome home. We've already had supper What's this? You're coming to the wedding tomorrow? I don't have much of a choice. All our friends are coming especially I see Setsuko, your father said he'll be there tomorrow He's coming to your wedding! I'm so happy! I knew he would Everything's fine now. I'm so happy There's no need to cry You have a big day ahead of you, so clean up and go to bed I'm so happy - Mother? - What is it? I'm so sorry I'm sorry I caused you all this trouble It's fine. All I want is for you to be happy Get yourself sorted out Hisako, go and help your sister Setsuko is really happy We really need you there tomorrow Do you want some celebratory food? Do you? - You're so carefree - How so? I never thought she would defy me It's not defiance Well ... for some reason, I'm not convinced Something's not right Getting married is a big event in her life ... ... but she took that decision without discussing it with us first and that troubles me We're just concerned for her, that's all - The mahjong table has been set up for you - Oh, very good. Shall we play? Bring some beer to the next room Let's play, then, shall we? Come on So this is what happened... ... I was the intermediary because his wife asked me But Hirayama isn't too keen on the groom - Why? - Well... It's hard to find someone suitable for one's daughter We spend so much time raising them, only to give them away How many children do you have, Sugai? None? Sugai has loads of kids. Six, isn't it? Seven? I bet they're all girls - Thought so - No question about it - So...? - Forget about it The thing is, you keep seeing them as children... ...then suddenly they're all grown up That's right That's the way it has to be Mikami, sing us that song for old times' sake? - Which one? - The one you sang when we went to Kure - Oh, not that - Which one? - The one based on a poem - I'd like to hear that - Go on, Mikami - Go on - Come on! - All right, then It's kind ofold-fashioned, though This is based on the death poem by the patriot Masatsura Kusunoki My father's noble precepts ... ... are engraved on my heart I will faithfully follow my emperor's edict It's pretty long, so carry on drinking while you're listening Ten years of remaining patient ... ... and now at last our time has come ... ... to strike a powerful blow for the emperor's cause and our struggle To fight and die as men, we swear an oath United as one ... ... we 143 companions of war ... ... are determined to fight until we reach victory I know that I shall not be returning ... ... so, among the names of those who have died by the catalpa bow ... ... I inscribe my own With the tips of our arrows we engrave our story ... ... as the blades of our swords shine resplendent in the evening glow Against the approaching enemy ... ...l et us walk with the same resolute steps ... ... and deal the final blow to their general That's enough. I'm stopping there Isn't there more? - You should go on if there's more - Go on I think that's enough for now - Go on - That's enough - It's inspiring stuff though - I agree Passing amid the verdant hills of Sakurai... ... now darkened by the evening gloom ... ... he tethers his steed beneath a sheltering tree ... ... and reflects on the fates and tides of time Are they tears that dampen his armour sleeve ... ...or are they drops of falling dew? So you met up with your daughter? She's coming round to the house soon They seem to be managing, so that's good It's difficult raising children, isn't it? Eventually, all parents have to let go ... ... and that's never easy That's true We must be getting old ... ... talking about our children at a school reunion True But we carry the dreams of our youth with us forever - I'm home! - Welcome back - Mr Hirayama of Tokyo is here - Really? Where is he? In the back room Hello! Welcome back Welcome to our home Thank you for coming to Setsuko's wedding It was my pleasure. Please accept my congratulations What brings you to Kyoto? Well, after my school reunion in Gamagori, I went on to Osaka Oh, I see. Have you taken care of all your affairs? Yukiko, what was it again? When Setsuko and her husband stopped at our inn ... - What? - What was the food they liked? - The pickled rape blossoms - Yes, they really liked them He says, "These taste nice," and she says, "You're right" He says, "You like it?" and she says, "Ooh, I do!" They're perfect for each other. Aren't they, Yukiko? And they stayed in this very room Well, thank you for looking after them - They were no trouble at all - They only stayed one night I invited them to stay longer ... ... but they just visited some of the sights and left Really? Mr Taniguchi seems such a kind fellow I hope Yukiko can find such a nice husband. Right, Yukiko? Absolutely! I would love to find a man like him What's not to like about him? Well, I've nothing against him personally - Excuse me, madam... - What? You need me? Excuse me Have some more, Uncle I apologise for what I did the other day - Sorry? - Don't be angry. Please forgive me Oh, you mean the set-up? Yes. I'd make a fine actress, don't you think? Very convincing. I fell for it hook, line and sinker! - Did you make it all up? - I'm sorry? You haven't found a man that you want to marry? No, I haven't, unfortunately. I can't seem to find anyone - Why not? - I just don't have time Your mother wants you to get married That's what she always says. It's got to be a habit I doubt that It's true. She just likes saying it Honestly, though, she doesn't want me to leave I don't believe that for a second She keeps picking candidates and then finds all kinds of problems with them She's like a child playing with building blocks Is that what you think? It makes it difficult for me It's time you started thinking seriously about it I can't get married and abandon my mother, I'd worry too much If I leave, she'll spend all her days fighting with Matsu ... ... and she'll ruin this place Matsu has the patience of a saint! Why couldn't someone marry into your family? No man would last long with my mother around You shouldn't worry so much about your mother Parents devote themselves to their children... ... and their children's happiness is all that matters You think? Of course. You shouldn't keep yourself from marrying because of your mother - But that's odd - Why? Didn't you once tell me not to get married? - Did I? - You said something about gold and brass Oh, yes, I did say that What you have to do is turn the brass into gold Get married, will you? It's time Your advice has completely changed. I'm confused Should I or should I not get married? It'd be better if you did This isn't a set-up? No, I'm not as good an actor as you are Think about it, anyway. If you find a good man, marry him If you find happiness, so will your mother - I'll think about it - Think it over carefully Always busy! - Have guests arrived? - It's the man from the tax office Yukiko, would you deal with it for me? Remember that handsome man with the nice neckties? He's asked us to bring our family seal ls he your newest candidate? I would like that Enough of that, Mother. Do you know what Setsuko said? What? She said you didn't look happy at the wedding She said you didn't even smile once That's what troubled her most Really? She told you that? Oh, I do feel so sorry for Setsuko You should smile in her company. It's not that difficult! Why don't you try it now? What? Yukiko, what do you think of him leaving for Hiroshima this instant? That's a great idea, Mother. Best idea you've had in ages! You should go and visit, Uncle Hiroshima? Yes. Then she'll stop worrying Excellent! It's decided, then I can't just leave my business This is more important than work Call Tokyo before he backs out I will! Hey, wait a minute! Hey! - You're so full of good ideas, Mother - Sharp as a tack! - You are! - Hey, Yukiko! - Take him to the phone - Right away! Tokyo 45-3136, please This is Gion 27-84 Hello? Hello, Auntie! How are you? It's Yukiko Uncle is going to Hiroshima to visit Setsuko Yes. Yes, that's right I'll put him on Quick, Uncle. Auntie's on the line Here Hello? It's me That's right, I'm thinking about it So you're really going to Hiroshima? I'm so happy. Setsuko will be overjoyed Well, I haven't made up my mind yet I don't think it's necessary for me to go. It's a long way Why are you laughing? What's so funny? That's typical of you! I know how I am. Anyway, you should go Don't worry I'm so happy. So happy Setsuko will be so pleased. I'm glad, too Listen, this isn't about making you happy. You see ... I know I'm so happy Send her my love. Goodbye Excuse me Send a telegram for me 'Arriving at Hiroshima 14:18. Stop. Father' All right? - I'll have it sent from Osaka - Please do The End
