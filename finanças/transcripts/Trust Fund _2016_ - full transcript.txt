JOE: Hey, Reese, how's the book? REESE: Almost finished. Gonna want mine signed. REESE: Oh. When did you get back? REESE: Yesterday. Uh, Louise just called. She pulled some things for me to see before she puts them out. For the charity event. You should come with me and help me pick something out. (LAUGHS) Oh, no, it's okay. I'm meeting up with dad. You sure? I haven't seen him. Ya. You go on. (PHONES BEEPING) Tall, non-fat, half-caff, sugar-free, extra-hot vanilla latte. You know me. How was it? (SIGHS) It was perfect. And who is he? How do you do that? Don't tell my father, you know how he gets. (REESE LAUGHS) Oh, is he here? His appointment ran late, he'll be here soon. He's anxious to see you. Go wait in his office. REESE: Okay. ("WAITING" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) GLORIA ON SPEAKERPHONE: Your father just arrived. He'll be up in a minute. Can I get you anything? REESE: Not unless you have a key. GLORIA: What was that? Nothing. Hi doll. Daddy. How are you? - Oh, I missed you. - I missed you, too. (LAUGHS) Sorry you had to wait. It's okay. GRAYSON: So, how was it? (SIGHS) It was amazing. I can't wait to go back. And I want to hear all about it, but that's not why I wanted to see you. It's not? We need to talk about what you're gonna be doing. Dad, come on, can we please do this later? I am so jet-lagged. Sweetheart, the bank calling about your account has become a routine. I know, it's so annoying. (SIGHS) It's time you start thinking about a job. Well, what about the advance on my book? You really think that can sustain you? No, but... Reese, I'm making deposits into your checking account every month. Where's the money going? I don't know. GRAYSON: That's why you need a budget. - Dad. - Sweetheart, even when I have disagreed with your decisions I have been supportive, you know that, but this clearly isn't working. Wait, dad. When you were my age, did you have everything figured out? When I was your age I didn't live in the most expensive part of the city. So, what are you saying? You want me to give up my loft? No, I'm saying I want you to consider other options such as moving home while you work and save up some of your money. Dad, that's not fair. I don't think you appreciate how hard I've been trying. - Just... - We have a job opening here. I can't. Dad, I can't do that. Honey, you'd still have plenty of time to do your writing. Daddy, I am so close. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yes? Your 11 o'clock's waiting in the conference room. Thank you, Gloria. Will you please make two copies of this and leave them on my desk? I've got to get to my next appointment. How about you come by after work. I'll take you out to dinner. You can tell me all about your trip and we can finish our conversation. I already have plans. Let me know when you have time. (DOOR CLOSES) ("STEALING" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) (REESE SIGHS) (PHONE ALERTS) REESE: Audrey and Reese Donahue, 10 million dollars. (ELEVATOR DINGS) Bye honey, have a good day. REESE: Bye, you too. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) Do you honestly think I would wear that? Maybe the blue. WOMAN: Okay. Still harassing the help? Try this. I still don't understand why I have to go. Do you have any idea how many girls would love to go? No. No, red doesn't suit you. But I like red. Well, I like orange, but I don't wear it. Have you ever seen mom's will? What are you talking about? REESE: Because I haven't. So? I was in dad's office and... Put my name on that blue dress. Let's go. Why the sudden interest in mom's will? She left us money, Audrey. Where did you get that idea? I saw it. You saw what? Saw the papers. She left us 10 million dollars, Audrey. Dad would've told us that, of course he would. I don't know. Maybe he's afraid that we would've left? You don't honestly believe that do you? Wouldn't you? Come on, would you really still be working at Donahue Publishing? I don't know. I guess so. I wouldn't. You don't. That's not the point. I need your help. Okay, show me the papers. I don't have them. They're still locked in dad's satch... What, you broke into dad's desk and you didn't take them? No, I didn't break in, I just, I saw them. Well, do you at least have a picture? No. So are you gonna help me? I didn't say that. (REESE SIGHS) Okay, I'll think about it. So, how'd it go with your dad? REESE: Fine. Sam's in town. You should come out with us. No, you go ahead. Maybe I'll come later. I think you should, he was asking about you. MAN: Taxi. Taxi. Is that really necessary? I stopped this cab. - Come on, babe. - I, I... (PHONE RINGING) AUDREY: Hello? Hey, why didn't you call me back? Look, I don't know what you saw, but until he brings it up there's nothing that we can do. Mom wanted us to have it. Well maybe he's saving it as a wedding gift. So what am I supposed to do, just wait? I don't know. (LAUGHS) Do you want to go to dad and say by the way, I was pilfering through your desk the other day. Why are you trying to make it sound like I did something wrong? Because you were going through his desk looking for money. It's not like I was looking for spare change. You know what, forget it. (PHONE BEEPS) (GASPS) She hung up on me. What? It's just like she thinks that she is entitled to anything. (SIGHS) I don't know why your dad wants her there anyway. We don't need the drama. I wouldn't worry. She'd be desperate to take that job. ("THINKING OF MILO" BY NATHAN MATTHEW) MEREDITH: How's your dad? Oh, he's really good. Why don't you let him publish you? I don't know. I guess maybe I just wanted to prove that someone else liked my work, someone with a different last name. You don't have to prove that your work is good. It is. You think so? Yes, I do. I rarely sign a book deal without a completed manuscript. Um, actually, I was wondering. Is it possible for me to get another tiny advance? Sure, as soon as you get me the rest. Um, ya, of course, it's almost done. I have a million things to do this afternoon, but this was nice. Will you please say hi to your father for me? REESE: Of course. It's been way too long. REESE: Thanks for squeezing me in. Any time. (DINERS CHATTING) (PHONE RINGING) No no no, tonight is great. Seven o'clock? Alright. See you then, I love you. (SIGHS) Gloria, will you change my dinner plans for tonight? I'm having dinner with Reese. ALLIE: He made reservations for two. I shouldn't be here. REESE: I thought it would be nice for you to have dinner with me and my father. - I also need you here. - What's going on? Nothing. Hi. - Allie, good to see you. - Hi. Good to see you. (REESE AND GRAYSON GIGGLE) Oh, I am wondering how I got so lucky as to have two beautiful women here at dinner. Thank you. How was Italy? - It was amazing. - Ya? Well I'm glad that you enjoyed the workshop. It is one of the best in the world. And Allie, what are you up to these days? I'm still at the same place. I'm hoping that something will open up in the marketing department soon. I'm sure something will. You seem to know what you want. ALLIE: I do. Good. Have you thought about the job offer? Well, actually dad, um, there was something I wanted to talk about with you first. GRAYSON: Alright. It's about mom. What about your mother? Well, I mean, you know how her foundation's name is on pretty much every charity event's donor list for like the next century? I don't know, it just seems strange that she didn't leave Audrey and me any money. Reese, as generous as your mother was, it was more important to her that you know who you are, and money can't help you with that. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) Excuse me, I need to use the restroom. Allie, you need to go, too, right? Ya. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) Gosh, I just need to think. Think about what? Okay. I need to talk to my dad about something, but I know something that he doesn't know that I know. I have to go now. I think your dad has a good point. You should take the job. I would jump at it. GRAYSON: You're not gonna believe what I ordered us for dessert. I'll take the job. ALLIE: Did I talk you into taking the job? I wasn't even sure you were listening. Your dad is so generous. You just get to step into that position. Do you know how many people would love to be you? Ya. I would love that job. I'd probably be really good at it too. ("FIRST DAY" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) (PHONE RINGING) GRAYSON: Hi. REESE: Sorry I'm a little late. GRAYSON: That's alright. (PHONE RINGING) Good luck on your new job, Sam. REESE: Hey. Well who's Sam? A guy. A guy that sends you flowers at work? Evidently. Well I don't remember you mentioning him. There's not really anything to mention. Well who is he, what does he do? He's still at school. Where? Harvard. (LAUGHS) No wonder you're not interested. Oh well. Don't screw it up, okay? What? AUDREY: The job. (phone rings) (BIRDS CHIRPING) REESE: I just didn't choose any of this. ALLIE: Oh, you mean work? REESE: No, I mean my life. ALLIE: Don't let Audrey get to you. REESE: It's not just her. I don't know, it's just... ALLIE: Girl, you need to forget about him. REESE: Who? ALLIE: Sexy, Italian guy. REESE: (laughs) I'd rather think about him than Audrey. ALLIE: I can see why. REESE: That makes me want gelato. ALLIE: I'm known to get gelato. (GRUNTS) Looks like you're working hard. REESE: My computer's not working. - Call IT. - I did. No one has come yet. Oh, just use mine. We're leaving. Thanks. (KEYBOARD CLICKING) ("ACCOUNTING" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) (PHONE RINGING) Hello? AUDREY ON PHONE: Lock the door on your way out. Yup. Because I think that we're missing that demographic and I think that we need to reformat or come at these things from a different approach. Right. Right. Reese, do you want to join the conversation? REESE: What? Sorry, did I pull you away from something? REESE: I was listening. Uh huh, sure, and you were just whiling away the time in your own little world. REESE: You know what, at least I have my world that I go to, Audrey. It's not me just being obsessed with work all of the time like I have nothing else to do. Ya, you have nothing else to do because you're... REESE: Wait, Dad. (AUDREY SIGHS) I don't think she was ready for this. Give her some time. I didn't need time. You have always been a doer. You get things done. Reese is a dreamer, a visionary. You'll see. Someday you'll need each other. (ELEVATOR DINGS) ("DREAMER" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) Do you have any idea how much of your work I have been doing? I've been doing things. - Why do you keep... - You have not touched one of these files. Okay, I am carrying you this, this, - this, this. - No, that's not all of it. That's not being fair. AUDREY: How am I not being fair? You can either fix this or you can leave. Been a long day, hasn't it? (GIRLS ARGUING) Somehow I saw this going very differently. I don't see how. You know, when they were kids... They grown women now. Ya, well I wish they would act like it. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (VACUUM HUMMING) ("STEALING" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) ALLIE: What's going on? I'm leaving. I'm going to Italy. Reese, how much do you actually know about this guy? It's not about him. Then why are you leaving? This is just something I have to do. ("WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) (MOVES INTO "ITALIA" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) Waiting for someone? I am. What brings you here? I fell in love. Ah yes, I was once in love. I thought it was serious but it didn't turn out that way. She was not as committed as I thought, sadly. I'm sorry it didn't work out for you. Don't be. She was not nearly as beautiful as you. I should've never let you go. ("HAPPY IN ITALY" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) No, no. I promise. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Listen. Okay. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Hey you. Morning. Is everything okay? (SIGHS) Ya. On the phone, you sounded pretty angry. It's business. REESE: You know, if you ever need money. I don't need your money. What's wrong with my money? If I took money from you... You wouldn't be taking it. I want you to have it. You sure you know what you want? REESE: I know exactly what I want. The bank called back and they confirmed the transaction. (SIGHS) I don't understand her. Daddy, you wanna see her as this innocent child, but she's not. We'll find her. We'll get the money back. We're not tracking your sister down like she's some kind of criminal.

Grayson, it's Jerry. GRAYSON: How's it going? What's going on with Reese? What, did you hear something? Well, Audrey called the office and made an appointment with one of the guys, but he got busy. So she told you everything? Not exactly. Remember that time when you handed me your car keys? You thought I was the valet. Well, I'm a lot more careful who I give my keys to now. Seriously, Grayson, whatever you need, I'm here. I appreciate that Jer. Oh and uh, tell Audrey that uh, next time, lunch is on me. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Remember my old college roommate, Jerry Peters? No. He's a private investigator. Well, that's very interesting. Audrey, why did you go behind my back and meet him just now? (SIGHS) Because I don't understand how you can just stand by and do nothing. Sweetheart, you are going to have to trust me on this.

Gloria, I don't know what I'd do without you. No need to worry about that. You know, it's funny, I still can't remember the day that I hired you. You didn't. Anne did. I miss her, too. Everyday. She would've wanted you to be happy. She wouldn't want for you to be alone. ("MILO'S FAMILIA" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) REESE: Oh my gosh, it smells amazing. MILO: Everybody, this is Reese. Ah, mio Milo. Buona sera. Gosh, you must've cooked all day. You don't like to cook? MILO: Come, come come come. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Papa. Milo, (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) This is Reese. Reese?

No. The Bianchi? MILO: Papa. So your family, what kind of business are they in? Reese is a writer. MARCELLO: Fabuloso. - Your mother must be proud. - Mama. Oh, no, no it's fine. My mother passed away when I was 16. MARCELLO: How? An accident. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Salute, (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) GROUP: Salute. Salute. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Is it true? About the Riviera Diamonds? Haven't I taught you anything? I know what I'm doing. MARCELLO: Who gave you the money? Reese. She wanted to. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Reese? She now tells you what to do? Papa. Emilio, you know diamonds can be traced. I told you I know what I'm doing. You're messing with the Russo's family territory. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) It's not worth it. You hear me? (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) What do you want? Do you want to end up in a box, with your American girlfriend? I'm getting too old for this. - No. - A little bite. I couldn't possibly have another. A little bite. MILO: Mama, what are you doing?

She wants to know what she's investing in. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) You said it was her who wanted the diamonds. Not exactly. But what happens when she finds out? She won't find out.

(SIGHS) (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) ("UNCOMFORTABLE BUSINESS" BY NATHAN MATHEW DAVID) (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) REESE: Do you know anything about investing? SOPHIA: (laughs) What would I invest? Nevermind, it's probably nothing. Reese? Just say it, what's wrong? I don't know. Milo's being kind of distant. He's not telling me where he's going or who he's meeting with. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I'm probably just being really paranoid or incredibly stupid or maybe both. Speak, talk little slower. I gave him all of my money. No. Reese. These numbers, they just don't add up. What you mean, don't add up? With investments you get returns, but it doesn't make sense that it would be this much. What, you think 'cause you're in Italy, everyone's a crook? REESE: No, that's not what I said. Okay, okay. You give him some money. How much? I'd rather not say. Then it's a lot? What were you thinking? This is Italy. I don't know. I just wanted to help him. SOPHIA: Help him what? What if he's doing something illegal? What are we gonna do? We? No, no we, (LAUGHS) no we.

REESE: Where've you been? Hey, hey hey hey. I was working. REESE: I saw you. You followed me? What did you do with the money, Milo? You don't trust me? It's not gone. We invested it. REESE: Why didn't you just tell me? I was trying to protect you. Protect me from what? Why would you leave? You think you're better than this? Than me? No, that's not what I was saying. Have you forgotten where the money came from? REESE: My mother wanted me to have that money. You didn't tell your dad you were leaving. REESE: He wouldn't understand. (weeps) Why you took the money? Or why you wanted to be with me? Hmm? (TRAIN CROSSING ALARM DINGING) How much longer? In a couple of hours, around midnight, I will be sitting in the corner. You will join me.

Your father thought you might be in over your head. You can't tell him. He just wants to know you're safe. Let's figure out where we are. Let's get you out of this rain, come on. (THUNDER ROLLS) You came a long way to spy on me. You remind me of your mother. I do? (LAUGHS) Your dad and I were friends all through college. And when he met your mother, everything changed. What do you mean? Love changes people. I'm not sure if he fell in love with her or her writing first. What about my mom? Was it the same for her with my dad? I don't think so, she was so busy with her writing, and she couldn't get anyone to look at her work. Because she was a first-time author. So, your dad said, "If no one will publish her, I will." And he started a small publishing company. With my mom. No, it was your dad who went to the bank and took out the loan. I guess I just always thought they started the company together. It was still small and struggling when they got married. They were quite a team. I checked out your friend Milo. He's not. I know. And you're supposed to take me home. Only if that's what you want. Can I use your phone? (INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (THUNDER DISTANTLY ROLLS) (SIGHS) Daddy? It's me. Can I come home? (PLANE ENGINE ROARING) ("REUNION" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) GRAYSON: Crying?

I'm so sorry, I promise I'll never... I know. What about Audrey? She probably doesn't want to see me. Well, we're having a few friends over tonight. I doubt anybody wants to see me. Allie can't wait to see you. Really? Ya. And Meredith will be stopping by. I feel really awful about Meredith. I wouldn't feel too badly. She's doing just fine. You talked to her? Oh ya, she discovered this new author, Mary Bridges. Have you heard of her? (LAUGHS) She called me as soon as she read your manuscript. She knew it was you. What did you think? Well, I'm prejudiced, but it is really good. I knew you could do it. (BIRDS CHIRPING) I don't think she was ready for the party yet. I told her two places would be set and the door was always open. Kind of nice that Allie to bring your summer camp friend, Sam. I'm glad you're back, I have so much to tell you. Oh my gosh, I was so afraid you we're gonna hate me. I just missed you, that's all. Sam, what are you gonna be doing after you graduate? I'll be taking the bar exam this summer. GRAYSON: And then where will you be working? Eventually I'd like to start my own practice. I'd like to be able to work for those who really need legal help, not just those that can afford it. GRAYSON: Good man. I think you'll do very well. Meredith, I am so so sorry. Oh, I'm just glad that you sent it to me. It's doing really well. GRAYSON: Seems like I paid for a hundred of them. How did you know it was me? It's nothing like what I've sent you before. I kept my eye on every piece that came in. And whether you want to call yourself Miss Donahue or Miss Bridges, I know your work. Is there something going on here? (SIGHS) Your father and I have been... I can see that. (LAUGHS) Are you working on a new book? Hey, you know what? Let's not talk about publishing, just for tonight. Okay. But I want to talk soon. I used to love summer camp; sailing and swimming. Can I come back to work? Well, I didn't give your cubicle away. First thing Monday morning. Be early. (PHONE RINGS) (REESE KNOCKS) I'm... Listen, I understand why you didn't come to the party. I mean, I probably wouldn't have either, but, um, but can we talk about it? I'm busy. Audrey, I'm really sorry. I know that what I did was wrong. GRAYSON: Morning, my beautiful girls. Morning, Dad. I'm really excited to get back to work. Good. Audrey, please, try to be nice. I am. REESE: I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. Meeting in my office in 15 minutes. We've a lot of catching up to do, and just give her some time, she'll come around. ALLIE: Don't worry, she knew it was temporary when she moved in. REESE: Thanks, but, you know what, I think I'm gonna stay home for a while. ALLIE: Your dad's been paying your rent. REESE: He has? ALLIE: Ya. (DOG BARKING) REESE: Audrey's not talking to me. ALLIE: Don't let Audrey get to you. REESE: I'm trying. ALLIE: It was nice to see Sam, wasn't it? REESE: I know you brought him, I assumed you guys were together. (ALLIE SIGHS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (CHILDREN PLAYING) You know, he's different than I remember. ALLIE: Ya. So are you. I would like to propose that we start a program for new writers. I really think that we can make the submission process easier, less scary. If we support and encourage them we could find a fresh voice, that new talent that otherwise might be lost in the slush pile. Alright. I think that wraps up everything for this week anyway. Thank you everyone, have a great weekend. Hey, thank you for sharing some of your ideas. I was really impressed with all the work you've been doing. Thanks. Ya. I thought your sister had some good ideas. You could've given her a few minutes of your attention. Well, the entire time that she was gone I was working. So, forgive me if I don't share in your enthusiasm. She's trying. Why aren't you? (LAWN MOWER HUMMING) (AUDREY FRUSTRATINGLY SIGHS) JONATHAN: Bad day? AUDREY: He has done everything but throw her a parade. JONATHAN: What are you talking about? AUDREY: She steals from the company, runs away with her boyfriend, and when she decides to come home he just gives her a pat on the head. (LAUGHS) I think she's even getting a promotion. Wait, Reese actually stole from the company? How much? Well, she said she only took what mom left us, but it doesn't matter. He covered for her like he always does. When your dad retires, who's he gonna leave the company to? When Reese decides to actually make another withdrawal, that's less for us. She wouldn't do that. Why wouldn't she if there's nothing to stop her? Think about it. (TOILET FLUSHES) Boy, I am glad it's you who's responsible for all this and not me. What do you mean? Well, if the IRS or who knows gets wind of what happened while Reese was in Italy, wouldn't look too good for you. What are you saying? I'm saying we should help each other. We both have a lot invested and I think we both want what's best for everyone. (CLASSICAL PIANO MUSIC) Why is it never chocolate? We're not here for the food. I know. We are here to smile and give them a check, so let's get it over with. Here, I'll do it. So, how's everything since Reese got back? Is everything okay? It's fine. We could hardly believe it. I mean, your poor father. (LAUGHS) I don't know what you're talking about. We ran into Jonathan at the club yesterday and he mentioned it. He didn't want to, but when we asked if you had set a date yet, he said that there were family issues. Sounds truly awful. AUDREY: Would you excuse me? Oh, oh sorry, would you excuse me? What's wrong? We're leaving. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Jonathan, come on in, have a seat. Steven tells me that you are concerned about some bookkeeping matters? Where might be a better word. I only told him to keep his eyes open. There have been some problems in the past we wouldn't want to deal with again. I'm sorry, I was unaware that you had to deal with anything. I realize you took care of it, but I'm not sure it was the most appropriate action since it did nothing to ensure it won't happen again. There should've been retribution. You've done nothing to take control of the situation and that affects us all. I'm simply trying to look out for your business which you seem to have forgotten about, letting Reese just waltz back in after everything. ("VALSE" FROM SWAN LAKE) Where have you been? - Another meeting. - Shh! Why would you feel that it was your place to take to Bridget and Lauren about my family? I can't even open my mouth. Do you mind? I can't hear. They're dancing, there's nothing to hear. I told you dad wanted to keep that inside the family. Apparently I'm not part of the inner circle. Oh, you're being dramatic. I'm just saying there's more that he's hiding, more than you know. Or maybe you do. Do you mind? You don't really think that, do you? I'm just saying it's the behavior of somebody who has something to hide. Why don't you just forget that I told you anything. Awesome. I have some good news for you. Dad fired Jonathan. There's an opening in marketing, you'd be perfect. Do you think I should call your dad? My dad loves you. That would be amazing. I don't even know what Audrey sees in him anyway. Tough to say. What one person might see in someone, someone else can completely ignore. I'm not ignoring him. Then you're stringing him along and that's even worse. Why didn't you and Sam ever get together? Mmm, maybe it's because every time I see him he asks how my friend Reese is doing. Really? ALLIE: Call him. You know what, I'm gonna text him, that way he won't see my interest. I think you're safe. Oh gosh, we were just kids. Everybody has their first crush at camp. Remember yours? (LAUGHS) Evan McMillan. Okay, okay, um... (PHONE BEEPS) (PHONE BEEPS) You have a date. You should come. Seriously? ("LET ME IN AGAIN" BY PARIS O'NEILL CARNEY) What if it's not a date and I thought that he thinks it's a date and it's not a date? Oh it's a date. How do you know that it's a date? Trust me. Hey. WOMEN: Hey. How's it going? WOMEN: Good. What can I get you. Um, you know what actually, I think that Allie was going to get her coffee to go. ALLIE: Ya, I've got a thing. What would you like? Oh, just a coffee, thanks. ♪ I don't wanna scare you off ♪ Is it too late ALLIE: Can I have a latte with non-fat milk? BARISTA: Of course. What can I get for you?

Dad can't fire my fiance. I mean, have you talked to dad? Jonathan told me everything. It's your fault. Dad always takes your side. You're leaving? What do you want me to do? Jonathan left him no choice. Oh really? Your father cant' stand by and watch him rip the company and the family apart. You are not a part of this family. You are nothing like my mother. Neither are you. (SOFT MUSIC) SAM: I didn't think I was gonna see you till tomorrow? I know, I got an early flight. SAM: So good to see you. How've you been? I've been so good, ya, things have been busy. SAM: Look who tracked us down. (laughs) Hi. Reese, this is Jill, my sister. Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you. Ya, Jill's in town for our grandmother's birthday tomorrow. You should come. SAM: Ya, she is. I want her to meet everyone. See you later? Yes. JILL: It's so good to see you. SAM: You too, you too. Nice to meet you. REESE: It's so nice to meet you. JILL: I'll see you. Thank you. (LAUGHS) ("REESE AND SAM" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) (REESE LAUGHS) When you said you'd plan dinner... SAM: I wanted it to be something you wouldn't forget. I won't. It's perfect. You know that summer my parents sent me to camp, I really didn't want to go. I wanted to stay in London with my friends. Ended up being my favorite summer. Mine too. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) It was so long ago. SAM: You're still the same girl. You don't know that. Well, (SIGHS) your eyes are still blue. Your favorite color, red. Your favorite dessert is anything chocolate (LAUGHS). - Your favorite book. - Jane Eyre. Charlotte Bronte. But she didn't use her real name. SAM: Like you. Like Charlotte. Tell me something else about you. I, I passed my bar exam. Sam! Oh my goodness, that's so amazing. - Congratulations. - Thank you. (REESE LAUGHS) And the law firm where I've been working, they have an office in London, and they've offered me a job there. That's wonderful. (SIGHS) It is? Well ya, I mean, isn't that what you want? I don't know. I've been wondering if there wasn't a reason to stay here. Just, I don't know, it seems like a really good opportunity. There are all kind of opportunities. You just have to choose what you want and what's worth waiting for.

Are you sure you don't want me to call the girls? I do not want you to tell them. Promise me you won't. They don't need to worry. I'll be fine, I just need a few days. To get a cat or not. REESE: Maybe they found one. Maybe. I'm here. Hi sweetheart. This better be important. Please, sit down. (AUDREY SIGHS) I've decided to sell Donahue Publishing, and Audrey, I would like you to come back and run the company until I find a buyer. Well, you can't just up and leave. I bought a little place up on a lake, and it's beautiful this time of year. What if I don't want to come back? Sweetheart, I can't think of anyone that I would trust more with this responsibility than you. (KEYBOARD CLICKING) You took my office. REESE: Just wait. What do you think? (SIGHS) (LAUGHS) Don't you think it's weird? I mean, he's here one day and then he's gone the next. It already feels so different without him here. (SIGHS) So, when are we gonna release your book? Audrey, we're not releasing it. I'm staying with Meredith. You're what? She took a chance on me. I don't know, I just, I really feel like it's the right thing to do. You know that she was just trying to start something up with dad? And that's the reason you got that deal. You don't owe her anything. Why do you care? Because it's good. It's really good. I saw it on the desk and I read it, and I think it'd be really good for us. And we've fallen away from a young adult audience. I really appreciate that but... You know what, sit in on the marketing meeting, see how you feel. I think you're gonna love what we can do with it. REESE: This one? AUDREY: No, it doesn't pop, doesn't say something. (MUSIC DROWNS OUT DIALOG) (SOFT SLOW MUSIC) REESE: Oh oh, I really like this one. So, I want you guys to think about big client relationships for you if you come work with us. Why don't you say something? She's just doing her job. Why don't you talk to your dad? I don't want to bother him. ALLIE: Then call Meredith 'cause somebody needs to do something. (SOFT SLOW MUSIC) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) MEREDITH: Audrey. Dad's not here, but I'm surprised you didn't know that. I was talking with Reese about the progress on her book. There wasn't a contract. There was a verbal agreement. Well she changed her mind. That's fine, but she's a talented writer and I would hate to see... You don't think that I'm capable of handling this? I think the goal is to reach the largest number of people quickly. I'm not sure it's your audience. Well that can change. You really want to take that chance on your sister's book? It has so much potential. I've got this. Thank you. (SIGHS) (SLOW SOFT MUSIC) Hey! I heard Meredith came by yesterday. AUDREY: Ya. And how did it go? She thinks that she knows everything. So... Audrey, I know that you don't like her, but she's really smart, she knows this business so well. I think if you just... She doesn't like me. Have you given her a chance? A chance to what? To take over? To take dad? Audrey, she's not taking anything. (GASPS) Where are you going? I'm meeting someone. Where's your ring? Look, I don't want to talk about it. Is that what you're wearing? What is wrong with this? Why don't you come over to the house? Okay, maybe I could pick out something fun. You know, you can loosen up a little bit. (LAUGHS) This is who I am. And if he doesn't like it. No, I'm sorry. That came out wrong. I just, I just thought maybe you'd want to put something more comfortable on, that's all. No. I'm fine. Okay. Um, have fun tonight, okay? See you later. (CLEARS THROAT) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (DOOR CREAKS) (SIGHS) (GASPS) MILO: I didn't mean to frighten you. What are you doing here? MILO: (laughs) That was not the greeting I expected. When the Policia couldn't find the diamonds, I knew why you left. You saved me. Where are they? Where are what? MILO: The diamonds. I don't have them. But you took them. No, I didn't. I didn't take anything. MILO: You took the statue. The statue you gave me? Where is it? (SOFT INTENSE MUSIC) (SIGHS) I almost lost it all. (SIGHS) I have a buyer. It's more than I'd hoped for. (MILO GRUNTS) ("THE DIAMONDS" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) Those are stolen. They're ours. No, no, I want to forget I ever had anything to do with that. How can you say that? You have no idea what you're giving up yet. I don't care, it doesn't matter. MILO: Of course it matters. No, not if you get caught. I won't. How can you be sure? ("THE DIAMONDS" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) If I got caught, all of the evidence leads right back to you. I tried to protect you. (REESE GASPING) AUDREY: Don't make a big deal out of it, just find me something to wear. Are you okay? (REESE CRYING) REESE: Milo. (weeping) Milo. Milo what? What did he do, did he hurt you? I had millions of dollars worth of diamonds in my closet. AUDREY: What? Where is he? On his way back to Italy. Okay, did you call the police? Wait, so after everything that he's done you're still protecting him? But if he gets caught, all of the evidence leads back to me. He told you that? I mean, it's true. It was my money and then I smuggled the diamonds in, and then I was hiding them this whole time. (WEEPING) No one has to know. REESE: But I do. (weeping) You're a bad judge of character and you make some bad decisions, but you're not a thief. Oh, you're not. (REESE WEEPING) Oh. But if I don't call the police then everything they said about me is true. No it's not. (REESE CRYING) (SIRENS BLARING) REESE: Do you ever wonder what it would be like if mom was still here? You mean, would we be sitting in a police station? (REESE LAUGHS) I don't know how I got here. Hey, I haven't done much that you should be proud of either. What are you talking about? You've accomplished so much. Doesn't mean anything. I think that I'm the reason that dad left. That's not true. (SIGHS) Think about. Why would he just drop everything? I mean, he loves his work. Yes, thank you sergeant. Well, they picked him up. They found the diamonds just like you said. What's gonna happen to him? He's gonna go back to Italy. He'll be charged there. AUDREY: And what about Reese? There's nothing, no evidence against you. (SIGHS) You'll have to come in and sign some reports, but after that you're free to go. Thank you, Charlie. CHARLIE: You're welcome. (REESE AND AUDREY LAUGHING) (UPBEAT MUSIC) (LAUGHS) You always got to push the button. I know, 'cause I'm better at it than you. You always got the wrong floor. (LAUGHS) Oh, hey, listen. AUDREY: Mmm hmm. I called Meredith, I'm gonna bring her on as a consultant. Wait, did I miss something? It's the only way if you wanna keep my book. (SIGHS) Okay, but if she tries to get over she is out. (LAUGHS) Good morning, Allie. Hey. I got caught up with some work. It's gonna keep me busy for a while. REESE: Oh. SAM: I'll um, I'll call you when I have time. Ya, ya, of course, um. Okay, well, bye. Audrey's even warming up to me. I should come back. No, you're not coming back. You're gonna stay there and do exactly what the doctor says. My heart is fine, I promise. What if I take a long weekend and come out for a visit? GRAYSON: Well, I'm feeling better already. How soon can you get here? MEREDITH: I'm already packing. Stop worrying, I think you're doing great. AUDREY: Thank you. MEREDITH: Your dad would be proud. (SIGHS) Thank you. (SIGHS) Leaving early? Ya, I'm taking a long weekend. Will you, will you tell him that we miss him. (LAUGHS) Yes, I will. ALLIE: What's your deal? REESE: No deal. I'm not leaving. What's going on? Nothing. (SIGHS) Okay, listen, I know that you think that you're helping, but you're really not. You should just call him. You're both miserable. You talked to him? He's going to London. (GROANS) I don't know why I let you talk me into anything. Allie? Allie, I'm sorry. To. Thank you so much for coming. (SIGHS) Well that was quite a turnout. It was worth it. Why don't you just call him? I don't know what to say. Well, I don't know either, but the worst thing you can say is nothing. I don't know, I just thought that maybe he would come say goodbye before he left. She's right, call him. Just tell him you miss him and you wanna talk. REESE: You think? MEREDITH AND AUDREY: Yes.

What if he does? ♪ All of the stories I was told ♪ Couldn't prepare me for my own ♪ I am a history of mess ♪ You were my perfect second chance ♪ But I gave you up for so much less ♪ All my secrets I can't help keeping ♪ Oh please believe when I say ♪ I take it back ♪ I change my fate ♪ To be ♪ With you ♪ To make you stay ♪ I take it all back Ladies, your dad called.

Well, if you don't want me to show up at your door you better come and see me. You think just because we're not working together you're gonna get rid of me? (AUDREY LAUGHS) (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) So has Charlie explained what this is all about? CHARLIE: We were waiting for you. So, who's the buyer. GRAYSON: Well, it's more of a merger. Wait, you're not selling? I've realized that I'm not ready to retire, I just needed a partner. So, Meredith and I have been in discussions and we recognize that our respective businesses have their own strengths, but they would be better together rather than apart. Uh huh, and is... And we got married the last time she came out to visit. I know, it sounds crazy, but we couldn't think of a good reason to wait. We've been friends for so long and I really love her, so we did it. (LAUGHS) (AUDREY LAUGHS) Dad, we are so happy for you. (LAUGHS) Thank you, thank you both. So now, when you were little girls your mother and I put some stock in your respective names. We just need your signatures and Charlie will do all the paperwork. What if we wanted to stay? And work with you and Meredith? Are you sure? AUDREY: Ya. Charlie, my girls want to stay in the family business. Will you please convert their old stock into new? Yes, sir. We have one last bit of business which is your mother's will. Charlie, will you please read the part that pertains to Audrey and Reese? I, Anne Donahue, with sound mind, bequest 10 million dollars to be divided equally among my two daughters, Audrey and Reese Donahue. I'll leave their father, Grayson Donahue, with absolute discretion as to when Audrey and Reese are of an appropriate age and should receive the money that has been placed in the trust for them. Charlie, I think they're ready. Dad, there's been a mistake. No, Charlie didn't make a mistake. Nobody's touched your trust. But, how could it be this much? Compound interest is an amazing thing, isn't it Charlie? Certainly is. I love you both. Our house tonight. We're celebrating.

Forget the past. What do you want? You remember summer camp? The summer we met? I still feel like that 13 year old boy trying to get your attention. I'm sorry. You know how I feel about you. Every time I think I should give up on you, you give me just enough hope that I can't let go, and I don't want that anymore. You're on, let's go. I just wanted to start off by thanking all of you for coming here tonight to celebrate my dad and his new wife, Meredith. I've been really lucky to learn what love is from my father. The way that he loved my mom (WEEPS) and the way that he loves my sister and me, and now the way that he loves Meredith. (LAUGHS) You really wouldn't think it would take me so long to figure out what love looked like. Sam, I love you, please don't give up on me. (GASPS) ("WHAT LOVE LOOKS LIKE" BY NATHAN MATTHEW DAVID) I think what she was going to say was, to Daddy and Meredith. (CROWD LAUGHS) GLORIA: Here, here. (CROWD CLAPPING) I'm so sorry I pushed you away. No, I was trying to say earlier, we've known each other a long time, and although we've not dated long, I have loved you half of my life.
