What was Rene Barjavel telling us with his grandfather paradox? Anyone? Anyone? Rene proposes this. Let's say that a traveler goes back in time to a point when his or her grandfather was not yet married with kids. At this time, the traveler kills his or her grandfather, thus preventing the traveler from ever being born when he or she was meant to be. In essence, the paradox has been used to argue that backwards time travel must be impossible. However, a number of hypotheses have been postulated to avoid the paradox altogether, such as the idea that the past is unchangeable. Therefore, the grandfather must have survived the attempted killing, or the traveler creates or joins an alternate timeline or parallel universe in which the traveler was never born at all. And I'll let you marinate on that until the next class. Thank you. Good day. How are you, Jacob? I'm fine. Jacob, I think I can tell you with all sincerity that you are indeed not fine. And that's OK. It's OK that you're not fine. I can't imagine the kind of pain that you must be experiencing. However, I feel compelled to do something, something that's within my power. No. Something that may aid in your healing. Jacob, I'm asking you to go home. I understand you've been living in a hotel for the past few weeks. Jacob, do yourself a favor please and go home. You never gave yourself time to process the loss. You came right back here, you started teaching again. I'm fine. Don't insult me, and don't insult yourself. Look at yourself. You look like you haven't showered in, in days. Jacob, you reek. You reek of alcohol. Greg, don't ask me to leave. Jacob, this is not something I take lightly. You need this time to heal. And it's only temporary. Don't make this any harder than it has to be. I care about you, Jacob. And I do want you here. Just not like this. I understand. Jacob? I'm sorry. Yeah. Old fashioned, please. Good evening, Professor Matthews. Look, I heard about what happened today. I'm really sorry. It's alright. You know the dean. I'm sure he has your best interests in mind. I know that he does. You know the person who wrote this is full of it, right? I do. Laughs Didn't I give you that copy like years ago? Yeah. What's it doing in your bag now? I guess I figured I have all this time now, I can afford to do a little mindless reading. I see. You know, you of all people should appreciate the ideas in that book. Such as? Such as the blurred lines that science and reality often meet each other at. The choices that need to be made when you physicists decide to play God. So you philosophizers aren't out there doing the same exact thing? Now you lost me. You don't see what you do as setting some kind of moral standard? Not at all. Common sense and inner decency set the moral standard. Oh, so we physicists, we don't have our own sense of inert decency? All I'm saying is science often asks can it be done much more than should it be done. Uh huh. And I say if it can be done, why not? You should really read this book. Mm hm. Fortunately for mankind, the only thing that I'm interested in right now is scotch or whiskey. You're going to be alright, Jacob. Yeah. Sarah please, wake, wake up. Sarah! No! Now don't get upset. I know we said we weren't going to get anything for each other, but I lied. You are such a tricky boy. What did you get? Oh, honey. It's so cute. Is that the one you wanted? It is. I got just the place to put it. Aw. It's gorgeous. You like it? I love it. I have it engraved with your initials. It's gorgeous. Thank you, thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. Cheers. Jacob? Jacob, come on and answer the door. Jacob? Jacob! What are you doing here? God, what are you doing? You need to go. What's going on here? This is, talk to me, Jacob. Tell me what's going on. This? This is insane. It's not a good time. Look, I'm working on, you just got to go. What are you talking about? You're not making any sense. None of this is making any sense. Why haven't you called me back? Sorry. I just needed to be alone. I'm your sister, Jacob. You can't just shut me out. You, you think that you're the only one that misses Sarah. I miss her too. I loved her. She was like a sister to me. I can't, I just can't. Can't what? Can't let her go? I, I understand. You have to find a way. She's gone, Jacob. You need to figure out how to Jamie. It's you, you need to go. Now! Let her go, Jacob. Philosophy is a love of wisdom. Sure, philosophy is a lot of other things that you've probably seen in the movies, read in your textbooks. But when you boil it down, philosophy requires you to love. Love is like, um, Gorilla Glue. It's the glue that holds the universe together. You think I'm kidding, but I assure you I'm not. Love is a binding agent, the majority of science. It's needed to unite the fields of mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry. And as a student of philosophy, it is your duty to understand how important love is to understanding the mysteries of the universe. Love is, hell, love is the reason you're all here, just ask your parents. And in the meantime, if you need more than love, please see Mr. Scott. Until next week. Jacob, it's good to see you. Andy, I need to talk to you. Can we go somewhere? Anywhere? Sure. I have to go back to my office to get a few things, but I'll meet you at Bella Vino in 30 minutes? Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Old fashioned, please. Jacob, how are you? Are you still on leave? I've been meaning to call but I've just been... You uh, you talk about a morality, talk about playing God. I, I need to know if it's OK. Jacob, of course it's going to be OK. It's just going to take time. These things take time. I'm, I need to know it's OK to go back. Back? Go back to what? I can, I can fix things. I can fix everything. I can fix it, I can fix it. I can fix it. Jacob. Jacob. Jacob, look at me. Listen. I found a way to go back and save Sarah. Jacob, you can't do this. You can't go down this road. She's gone, Sarah's gone, and I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. You're not listening. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Andy. I know I can't bring her back. I'm not, I'm trying to tell you I, I can go back. I can go back and save her. And save her. Jacob, what are you telling me? I can't, I can't tell you anything. Not in here. I got to show you. I forgot my cell phone. What? It died because I forgot my cell phone. Jacob, I don't know what you're talking about. I've never been a forgetful person. Never. I went back into the office. I found it under a stack of papers. I missed three calls. No voicemail. So I called her back. Nothing. Called her again, nothing. I figured if it was important she'd just call me back. You didn't do anything wrong. Found her propped up with a bullet hole in her chest. I missed saving her by a matter of minutes. Jacob, you've got to stop this. This is not going to bring her back. You're absolutely right. But this will. Jacob, are you telling me what I think you're telling me? Is this a time Yes. No way. It's not possible. This is not possible. It is. Indeed it is. How? How do you know this thing even works? I know. How? How do you know? I've tested it. I've sent something back. You sent something back? This is insane. You can't do this. Write the name of your childhood pet on this pumpkin. Come with me. How? How is this even possible? I need your help, Andy. Need my help to do what? You can't do this, Jacob. You can't change the past. Why not? What would you do if it was someone that you lost? Would you do anything? Everything? Would you still care about balancing morality? Look, I know this is crazy, but I know what I'm doing. Hey, I can save her. Please, will you help me? Help you do what? Once I'm gone, I need you to destroy the machine. Destroy? Why? You have to promise me. You have to destroy it. How? You should burn it. And when is this supposed to happen? Right now. Can you ever come back? No. Never. Jacob. Are you sure? Are you sure this is what you want to do? Did you mean what you said? What? Does love really hold the universe together? Yes. Yes, it does. Once I'm in the machine, hit Enter. Jacob, no! No Jacob. Oh my God, I didn't know it was you! Where were you? I didn't know it was you! Sarah, Sarah. It's OK. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Stay with me, stay with me. I love you, I love you. It's OK. I'm going to get you help. You just got to hang on. Just hang on, I'm going to get help. No, no, no, Jacob. No. Wake up! No! No! Music They say history will find us on the last train, and we'll make all the same mistakes that they made. And we will never rule tomorrow our way out. Love, it's too late now. And they say nothing comes from going against the grain. And though we are the diggers of our own graves, and we will crash and burn before our train leaves this town. Love, forgive me now. Forgive me now. They can burn in hell, hell. They can burn in hell, hell. They can burn in hell, hell. They can burn in hell, hell. Forgive me now. Forgive me now. Forgive me now. Forgive me now. Forgive me now, forgive me now, forgive me now.
