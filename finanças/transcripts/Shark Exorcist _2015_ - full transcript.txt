(dramatic music) (woman screaming) (suspenseful music) - [Man] A state wide search continues this morning for 24 year old Vanessa Blair. Miss Blair, also a Catholic nun is being accused of the brutal torture and death of 13 little boys and girls. (light dramatic music) (water splashing) - The world has betrayed me. (dramatic music) So the world will taste my vengeance. - You bitch! You bitch, I know what you did. Everyone knows you did it. I'm gonna make sure they punish you, and I won't stop until you're rotting in hell. (guts squishing) (suspenseful music) - Lord Satan, accept my sacrifice. Send me an avenger! (light dramatic music) (car engine rumbling) - [Lauren] 100 degrees outside and this car's got no air conditioning? Real nice. - I like it hot. - Well, you're weird. - Lauren, we're almost there, okay? - You said that like two hours ago. - Yeah, well look, there's a sign right there. So we're here, no more bitching, all right? - Yeah, Lauren, be nice to Emily. - Thanks Ali. - I'm always nice, but if this isn't one amazing waterpark, I'm gonna be one pissed BFF. - Okay, this is not a waterpark, it's just a lake. Just a plain, old, normal lake. - I know it's a lake, but they've gotta have some kind of monster water slide, right? - Nope, sorry, just a plain, old lake. - Well, is there at least a wave pool? - Okay, what about just a lake do you not understand? - Well, I don't know why I'm going. What can you even do at a lake? - Like swim or work on your tan, just normal lake stuff. - Ali, did you know about this. Emily says it's not even a waterpark. I say we skip it. - You mean just go home? - [Lauren] Yes, Ali, what part of just skip it don't you understand? (car door slamming) - Okay, Lauren, I'm gonna go work on my tan, so you just amuse yourself. Um, are you coming? - Wait, I wanna work on my tan, too. - Of course you do. All right, um, are you going? - Give me just a minute. - All right, suit yourself, I'll be by the water. - [Lauren] We'll be by the water. (sighs) - Hey, Bobby, it's me. Why aren't you picking up? Tell you what, just call me when you get this. Seriously, Bobby, just call me. (sighs) - So, is Ali doing okay? - [Lauren] I guess, why shouldn't she be okay? - I don't know, didn't her boyfriend like cheat on her, what's his name? - Who knows, she didn't say anything to me about it. - Or she might've said something but you never listen. You're not the world's best listener. - I do listen. - Um, then, close your eyes. - [Lauren] What? - I said close your eyes. - What's going on? - What color is my swimsuit? - Um, I don't know, green? - Not even close. - Um, it's pink. - You are such a cheater. You totally looked. - No, I didn't, but whatever. I do pay attention. - Where's Ali right now? (light piano music) (dramatic music) (water splashing) (gasping) Is that Ali right there? - Where, I don't know what you're talking about. - Yeah, it is, come on. I'm coming, Ali. Oh, my God, Ali. Ali, are you okay? What happened? (light dramatic music) Stay with me, stay with me. Oh, my, God. You're my best friend, Ali, you've gotta stay with me. You've gotta stay with me. What happened? Are you okay? Oh, my God. (Ali groaning) Lauren, where are you? Stay with me, stay with me, okay? (Ali groaning) We're gonna get some help. We're gonna get some help (hushes). Calm down, calm down. Okay (hushes), calm down, calm down. Calm down, come on. Lauren, get some help, please. Tell me what happened. What happened, are you okay? (hushes) Come on, stay with me, we're gonna get some help. We're gonna get some help, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. (hushes) It's okay, it's okay. (suspenseful music) (muffled talking) - [Woman] Dr. Bowen, Dr. Bowen, some to the ER stat. There's a patient here, she's been attacked by a shark. - This is Brian Bennett with Channel Nine News, live from Paris Landing where for the past week swimmers have been terrorized by a bizarre series of brutal shark attacks. Currently, the entire area has been closed while police try to determine if the reports are true and in fact a man eating shark is loose in these waters. Stay tuned to Channel Nine News for more on this developing story. (upbeat music) - [Emily] Sit down I need to talk to you. - About what? - I just got back from the hospital. - Cool. - Why haven't you been there to see Ali? - Just because. - Okay well I thought that you might wanna know that she got released today because apparently she got miraculously healed from a shark bite. - That's cool, whatever. - Well, I'm also worried about her going back to Bobby, you know he cheated on her. - Bobby didn't want anything to do with her. - Okay, how do you know that? Have you been doing something behind Ali's back with Bobby? - Whatever. - No, I'm serious. If you have been, like, Ali's gonna be super pissed and it's just gonna make a big mess of things. - Whatever. - Lauren, I'm serious. A big mess. (spooky music) - Hello, I'm Nancy Chase and welcome to another episode of Ghost Whackers. Where we explore the paranormal, the supernatural and the unexplained. Today, I'm at Paris Landing, the scene of a strange series of attacks that turned beautiful bodies into blood soaked mangled corpses. Reports claim a giant shark is feeding on the swimmers. Is that really true? It seems impossible, but I wanna know for sure. How we can we do that? By asking the victims themselves. I want to create a psychic link with the troubled spirits. Three women have died here. Do their souls still remain to give us the answers? I want to find out, don't you? Yes, I thought so. (light dramatic music) Spirit of the water, speak to me now. I must know the truth. I must know, give me the truth. How did these women die? Tell me, I need to know. Is there something evil beneath these waves or is it something far more sinister than even I can imagine? Tell me, speak to me, speak to me spirit of the water. (dramatic music) (groaning) These waters are mine. Do you hear me? Mine! Forever. I will eat your flesh and swallow your souls. (screaming) Forever. (gasping) - [Emily] I still can't believe it. It's been three weeks and you just feel like-- - [Ali] How do I seem, Emily? - [Emily] Like, nothing happened. Like, it was just a bad dream. Three weeks ago there was this chunk bitten out of your leg. We all thought you might die. - [Ali] Well, I guess it wasn't that bad, was it? - [Emily] You're taking a very, very strange attitude. I'm not sure I like it. - [Ali] Look, I'm sorry I'm not all happy, smiley 24/7, Emily. Like you said, I almost died. - [Emily] You did Ali, and I was so scared. - [Ali] Maybe it's be better if I had died, then you wouldn't have anything to worry about. - [Emily] Ali, don't you say that! - I mean, that's the thing about almost dying, Emily. It is a real buzzkill. Look, you don't have to worry about me. I'm fine, you said so yourself. - (sighs) It's just not normal. - Not normal that I'm better? Look, I don't even need this bandage anymore. See? - Oh, my, God, Ali, there's not even a scar or anything. - Whatever, look, I'm going home. I just wanna soak in my tub. - That's all you do anymore is just soak in your tub. - You should try, it feels good. Hey, you wouldn't be going to the lake now would ya? - You're not talking about Paris Landing, are you? - [Ali] Well, yeah. - Ain't that where them people got killed? Something about a shark. - Look, I don't know. But I'm going with you or without you. - Oh, shit, come on. - Really? - Hell yeah. - Great. (slapping) - Shit. Damn. (light music) (muffled children talking) - [Boy] I bet she made fun of him. - [Boy] No way! - [Boy] It's hot out. (light dramatic music) Bosco, hurry. (dramatic music) (water splashing) (water bubbling) (light dramatic music) - [Zoowski] My dear Father Michael, it is with a heavy heart that I must inform you of the death of your brother. The circumstances of his death are still a mystery, but an investigation is underway. In the meantime, let me assure you that our love and our prayers are with you always. In Christian faith, Monsignor Zoowski. - Ali, Ali? Ali, are you in there? (knocking) Ali? (sighs) Ali, God. - On our last episode, I attempted to make a psychic connection with those who've died here, but what I channeled was something far more evil. I believe there is a demonic force right here. Something filled with pure evil. If there is a shark here, I believe it's possessed. Possessed by a demon. - [Briana] Bullshit. - Who the fuck said that? - I'm Briana Bennett from Ghost Fakers and I've been on these shark attacks since they first started, and that's just what they are, shark attacks. No ghosts and no demons. She's just trying to terrify people for the sake of ratings. - Anyways, back to me. Miss Bennett, I'm a serious paranormal investigator. I created a psychic link right here at this lake. And it was something evil, something demonic. - I want you to take a good look out there. It's just a lake. There might be a shark out there, but it's definitely not possessed by the devil with tiny red horns and a pitchfork. Now why don't you let the real journalists do their job and stop trying to sensationalize these tragic deaths. Folks, do yourself a favor and turn the channel. Don't give this fraud anymore airtime. - You're supposed to keep the camera on me. (light dramatic music) - Sibyl, my sister, we call on you. Hear us. - I can't do this. - Silence. Spirits, we come humbly, hear our call. We seek only the truth and nothing more. (woman screaming) (moaning) - What was that? (groaning) - Hear is, my sister. Come to us, come to us now. (moaning) (crying) (gasping) - What's wrong with her? - She's just faking it, she's so pathetic. (groaning) (suspenseful music) (gasping) (groaning) (growling) (dramatic music) (screaming) (giggling) (thudding) (light dramatic music) - Hi, I didn't see you here. Wanna play? - [Ali] I like your sharks. - Me, too, sharks are so cool. No, please don't eat me, oh no. Oh, I'm gonna eat your right now. Why do you have the good parts? - So, what do you like about sharks? - Everything, really. - I think they're beautiful. Perfect creatures. - [Girl] So what do you like to do-- - Ali. - So what do you like to do, Ali? - I like to get wet. (light dramatic music) - Don't look yet, don't look yet. Are you ready? It's a surprise. Surprise! You said you like to get wet. (giggling) (funky music) (girl giggling) Okay, I can take a hint. (water splashing) What are you doing? - I'm listening. - Listening to what? - Your heartbeat. Can't you hear it? It's going faster and faster and faster. - You're freaky. Ali, Ali, where'd you go? (heartbeat pounding) (screaming) (dramatic music) (light dramatic music) - I call upon the spirit of the water. The malevolent presence from hell. I know you're there. I felt you. You've infected me. And loved me. And the shark attacking the swimmers, I know that's you! That is your evil. I know it is. Show yourself. Show yourself! Yes! Oh, God. I can feel you. Oh, come inside me. Spirits, yes. - [Cameraman] I don't get paid enough for this shit. - Yes. Spirit come in me. Yes! (groaning) Infect me, inside me. (light dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - Hey, it's me Brianna. Yeah, I'm at the park. Followed that bitch Nancy from Ghost Whackers here. I know she's up to something and I'm gonna expose that bitch for the fraud she is. (dramatic music) (groaning) (screaming) Don't, no! (dramatic music) (man chuckling) (suspenseful music) - Holy shit! No. (gagging) Oh, God. She's still kinda hot, I'd still do her. (horn honking) - I told you 1:00 p.m. sharp. Don't ever keep me waiting again. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, too. - Holly, Michelle, maybe I'm confused here. I thought you both wanted to be in Gamma Zeta Beta. - No, we totally do. - Absolutely Sheila, I mean your sisterness. - I'm not your sister, yet. There's still one more initiation test. - Another? - If you think you can handle it, but I'll understand if you just wanna give up. - No way. - Never. Wait, what's the last test? - Are you both wearing your swimsuits like I told you to? - Yes, see. - Great, buckle up girls. This is gonna be a bumpy ride. Get out both of you, and leave your clothes here. - So, is this a swimming test? - Hm, something like that. Do you know where we are? - The beach? - Not just any beach. This is Paris Landing. - Wait, isn't that where all the-- - Sharks attacks happened? Good job, Holly, high five. Low four. - Wait, so there's a shark in the water? - I don't know, maybe it got bored and swam away. That's what you guys are here to find out. - [Both] Us? - Of course. You guys are gonna swim out for exactly 10 minutes as far as you can, and if you make it back without becoming shark bait, consider yourself official sisters of Gamma Zeta Beta, your favorite sorority. What could be simpler? Now, who's first? - Can we come back yet? - [Holly] Please. - Oh don't be babies. You're barely even wet. I wanna see the waters up to your necks. - But I'm scared. - Well, boo hoo, I guess you're not cut out to be a sister, Holly. - Come on, Holly, we have got to do this. - I don't want to. - It's just a few more minutes. - Listen to her, Holly. If you wanna be a sister you've gotta get wet. (screaming) - I just felt something. I just felt something, Michelle. - It was my leg. I accidentally bumped you. Gosh, Holly, you can not freak out like this. - Five more minutes, ladies. Ready to come back? - No, we are going to do this. - What about you, Holly? It's okay to be scared. I won't tell anyone your just a big pussy. (screaming) (shark groaning) (shark crunching) (door knocking) (light dramatic music) - I'm sorry to bother you, is this where Ali Stevens lives? - Do I know you. - No, not exactly, but it's urgent that I see her. - You're not a stalker or something are you? - I can assure you I'm not, ma'am, I'm a priest. - A priest? The last time somebody said they were a priest was at this bachelorette party and he ended up not being a priest if you get what I'm sayin'. - Well I can assure you I'm not a stalker. - All right, well I just have to ask 'cause see, Ali gets a lot of those. She has that look, if you know what I mean. All the boys love Ali. - Emily, can you please sit down? Look, I know what happened to your friend, Ali, and how she was attacked by a shark three weeks ago. - Everybody knows about that, I mean it was all over the paper. I mean, it was kinda crazy though, right? A shark in this part of our town. - Well, did you know there was a shark attack at that same lake about a year ago this time? - No, I had no idea. - No, it was kept quiet. That's why I'm concerned for your friend. I was wondering if this is the same shark that attacked her. - What's a shark doing in a lake anyway? I mean, don't they normally live in the ocean? - Normally, but we're not talking about a normal shark here. That's why I'm concerned for Ali. - Ali's fine, I mean she was healed like miraculously, it was a miracle. But this wouldn't have anything to do with why she's acting weird, would it? - How weird is she acting? - I don't know, it's weird. She's like sleeping all the time, never eating, barely talking to anybody and she's obsessed with water. I mean everything has to do with water. She has to be in it or around it. It's almost like she's I don't know-- - Yes? - F'd up, like a lot. - There's something I need to tell you. - What? (muffled talking) (carnival music) (dramatic music) (car doors slamming) (car engine rumbling) (spooky music) (suspenseful music) (light dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (groaning) (light dramatic music) (spooky music) (suspenseful music) - Oh, shit! (hissing) (dramatic music) - Demon, the power of Christ commands you. (dramatic music) (groaning) I'm speaking to the demon who possesses this woman. Demon, do you hear me? I order you to cease your evil and corruption. Demon, be gone. - We're gonna need a bigger cross. - Emily, stay back. - What are you gonna do? - I'm going to perform the holy right of exorcism. It's the only way to save your friend. - Do you know how to perform an exorcism? - Not exactly. - What does not exactly mean? - Well, I'm read the sacred texts and they described procedures for casting out demons, but-- - But, you've never actually performed one before? - What kind of demon are you? Why are you torturing this innocent woman? - Hurry, it's gonna kill her. - Why should I, priest? I like it here. - Why are you torturing this woman? Leave her now. - She likes it, priest, she begs for me. I can feel her body fill with every inch of my poison. I will destroy her. - Hurry, help her. - Only one thing can stop me. - So you can be stopped. - Of course. Should I tell you how? - Tell me. - Come closer. (roaring) (vomit splattering) - Damn you. Damn you! - No priest, damn you and damn her for all eternity. - [Michael] I'll kill you - No. Don't, you'll hurt her. - Oh, sorry, forgive me. - You have to remember that's the demon talking, it's not Ali. Remember that. - You're right, you're right, I'm sorry. - Are you frightened priest? Afraid you might kill this body? 'Cause I want you to. I want you to destroy it, so then your soul will be damned for all eternity. - I will not let you win. Be gone, demon. In the name of God. - You want me to leave this body? Then how about a little bargain? - You'll take me? - I think that's a fair trade. Your body for this woman. - Yes, okay, just set her free. - Father Michael, don't do it. Please don't. - Too late, he must. (dramatic music) What happened? Hey Emily, what's going on? Who's that, who's that? (screaming) - Oh, my God. - What are you doing? Go away, get away. - Ali. (screaming) (groaning) (car engine rumbling) (dramatic music) (car door slamming) (suspenseful music) (airplane roaring) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (screaming) - Hail Satan. (dramatic music) (light music) (light dramatic music) - Emily. Emily. (suspenseful music) Emily. Emily, please tell me what's wrong. - You don't wanna know. - Yes, yes I really do. - Forgive me. (water splashing) (screaming) (dramatic music) (creepy music) (light dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (light dramatic music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (light dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (light dramatic music)
