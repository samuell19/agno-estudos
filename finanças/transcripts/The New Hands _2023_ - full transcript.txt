Sorry, I forgot the rest. You forgot? Yeah, I messed it up. Why are you pouting? Are you really that upset? You know how many times I've practiced that? My hands still- Your hands are amazing. Amazing? Yes, amazing. But I also just think hands are amazing in general. They're what separate us from animals. We can do things they can't because of our hands. They're why humans are the top predators. Yeah, great... We're number one. You know, Some people say you can learn everything you've ever wanted to about a person just by looking at their hands. Are you a fortune teller now? I'm serious. Give me your hands and I'll tell you everything. Just look at them. They're a little rough on the inside, but that's okay. What does it mean? It means sometime in the past, you had to work really hard for something. You put all your strength into it and it left you changed... permanently. You lived life. I've been known to do that every now and then. Oh no. What? I have to get a book for class from the library before it closes. Wanna come? Found it. What's it for? Literature. Old Man Scrimm is having us write a paper on how, "Words can cut deeper than any knife ever could." or something like that. Your hands are nice too. You know, because earlier you said I had nice hands... Thank you. Now you're the one pouting. You shouldn't have said that. What, that you have nice hands too? Stop it, they're not nice, they're disgusting. Hey, wait, come on. What's wrong? Can we just drop it please? Yeah, of course we can. Come on. Let's check this out and go back to your place. Zora? I didn't say stop. Are you going to stay the night? We have work in the morning. Zora? Yes, do the thing. Dot. Dot. Stab in the back. Blood running up. Blood running down. Spiders crawling all around. Slight breeze. Slight breeze. Tight squeeze. Good morning, Bram. You can proceed when ready. Thank you, Dr. Norris. Clear. Excellent, go ahead and initiate. And proceed with phase one. Getting a little hot. It's perfectly normal. Proceed with phase two. And proceed with phase three. I'm not sure we should, sir. Why is that? Pulse intervals are irregular. Temperature is high, might be a bad sample. Impossible, proceed with phase three. Maybe we should just wait for it to cool down and try- Proceed with phase three at once. Look, son. I don't have all day for this. Unbelievable. Sir, shouldn't we turn it off now? You wanna keep your job? You walk over there and you put both hands on that goddamn button and then you pray to God you can muster the strength to push it. Just look at them... They're a little rough on the inside, but that's okay... Sometime in the past you had to work really hard for something. You put all your strength into it. And it left you changed... permanently... Good evening, Mr. Victor. Ready to go home? Yes. Great. How do you feel? Not great. I completely understand. You know, you have to face the reality of the situation, you suffered catastrophic burns. You may never be able to regain the use of your hands, but you know what? With a good attitude and diligent work combined I've seen miracles happen and you can be a miracle too. Thank you, doctor. I know you tried your best. Well, if it helps your employer called and they said that they would pick up the medical expenses that the insurance won't cover. My employer? Yes, the um, the laboratory? I know that the meds, they probably make your memory really fuzzy. Do you remember the incident? Yes. There was an accident at the lab. Where's Dr. Norris? I'm sorry, I don't know a Dr. Norris. Does he or she work here? No. Well, here's a prescription for more painkillers and you should just refill them when you need, but be careful with the benzos that the quacks gave you upstairs because they could really mess with your head. Listen, I believe in you. I really do. Do you have a ride? No. Uber. I understand. Well, Mr. Victor. Thank you. I'm sorry I didn't stay with you at the hospital. It's okay. I know how hard it must've been for you to see me like that. I thought maybe it was just a bad dream, but... here we are. What are you going to do? I was going to cut them off. Cut them off? The bandages. Will you help? I haven't looked at them since... the accident. Go on, don't be afraid. Oh God. You have to help me. Will you stay? Paging Dr. Stateman. Dr. Stateman, please. Oh. Bram. Dr. Norris. How are you? Not good. Right, right... Uh, by any chance, did HR get ahold of you? No. I see. Let's talk in private. Michael Crawfin, 340. Michael Crawfin, please call 340. The executives feel it would be too much of an insurance liability to continue your employment. You're firing me? Well, technically no. No, it's called letting you go. I can't believe this. The Executives have prepared quite a generous severance package. Farewell, cruel, disappointing, world. I have lost everything. There's nothing left to live for. My hands were perfect. And she loved them. And she loved me. But now they're cursed. If only I had my old hands. If only I had new hands. Are you utterly alone? Did your girlfriend just leave you?

For more information, please consult your local library. Hello. Good morning, sir. Is there something I can lend you a hand with? Oh. Do you need a hand? Do you need my help? Yes, I'm looking for books on surgeries and amputations. Okay, then you're gonna wanna look on the second to last row in the back. That's the medical section. Thank you. Your hands are very lovely. Thank you. Alternative methods in the wondrous field of amputation, by Dr. Adam Maitland. Chapter one. You and your new hands. New advancements and discoveries are being made daily in the burgeoning field of alternative amputation and transplantation. I have discovered a method of perfectly restoring and replacing damaged tissue through methods once frowned upon and thought outrageous in the medical community. We stand at the dawn of a new age of enlightenment and under the right circumstances even the most hopeless of cases can be given an opportunity, a second chance to return what was once lost. Were you followed? No, I don't think so. Your hands. Get inside quickly. Tell me, what is it you want? New hands. Yes, I can see that. I'm always fascinated when people say what they think they really need. Tell me... what do you really want? I want my life back. And there it is. I do have to warn you that all my medical licenses have been revoked. The board felt my procedures were a bit too... peculiar. I don't give a damn whether you're licensed or not. Can you do it? Sit. What is your name? Bram. Bram, what? Bram Victor. Well, Bram Victor, I can see it in your eyes. This is important to you. If you were able to... acquire... the proper donor organs. I will do the surgery. You will? Yes. I'm afraid I don't have much to give you in terms of money. My employer did give me a check for severance. You think Milgram did it for the money? Great minds, do it for the art. For the love of creation. The love of giving life. Although. Money's nice too. Don't think I can't take cleaning another one of these stupid disgusting rooms. It helps to think of it as community service. Like you're doing something for the betterment of mankind by mopping this floor. I don't see how that would be possible. You know what? I really don't think the world is as bad a place as the news makes it out to be. In fact, I think for the most part things are getting better overall crime's at an all-time low and- I'm done. You ready to shut this place down for the night? Are we the last ones here? I think that dickhead Norris is over in 13, trying to salvage whatever he can. So... How's Bram? He's different. I'm sorry. Are things not well? We broke up. I'm sorry to hear that. It's fine. Let's just go. But what about finishing the win- Norris knows how to set the alarm. All that hard work and preparation... For nothing! Because of some rube- Hey, there's someone's still in here! Boo, motherfucker. Bram. I've come for your hands, doctor. Listen friend, you don't have to do this. I'll go to the board. What stay fate's hand from thee? If you don't leave, I'm gonna call the police. No don't. No. No. Please, don't! I did it. I can't believe I fucking did it. Okay, I just... would like to see you turn your wrist now. If it hurts too much, you can put it down. That's incredible, how's your pain? Everything hurts. I just meant physical. Fine. I can hardly feel them. I see. Okay, you can just set it down now. So have you had any headaches or blurred vision? No. Any... suicidal thoughts, or... ideations? No. I mean, I have thought about it, but... doesn't everybody? I suppose we do. Have you had any hallucinations or feeling like you were talking to people who weren't really there? No. Any homicidal thoughts? No. Why are you asking me this stuff? These are all the questions I ask my patients who've suffered major trauma. Are you out of painkillers? No, I still have a whole bottle left over from the other day. Well, here's a prescription for more painkillers. You can take them down to the pharmacy and they'll fix you right up. Thank you, doctor. You're welcome. Hello. Yes, this is him. Yes. I'm so sorry, that's very unfortunate, oh no. Uh, right now? Uh, I'm afraid I have some business to attend to, I'm so sorry. What do you want me to do? Will I be able to get my pills in my new home? Yes, May. Oh. One, two, three, four, They're all here. Isn't that wonderful? Anyone home, hello? I can't just leave this lady standing out here. Hey, hey, what's going on here? Oh, you're here. So hey, I got another elder in the van I need to drop off before he withers away. You can take this one, right? No. She's all out of money, man. There's no room left for her, and to be quite honest, we're all sick of her hollering about her son this, how she can't wait to see him again, blah, blah, blah. But she's old. Sir. I need to go. Thank you. Hi, May. Hello. I'm Bram. Your grandson. Don't be silly, I don't have any grandchildren. It's just me and my little boy, William. Okay. You don't remember me... I'm Bram. I'm William's son. Is that you, William? No, Grandma, William is dead. You are William. I can see that. You've finally come back to me. You've been gone so long. Why did you leave me here? Grandma, you're you're sick, okay. That's preposterous. I'm perfectly fine. My pills make me better. How about you take a nap. Try to get some rest, And I'm gonna go make some phone calls, okay? Yes, I think I could use the rest. - Great. - William. I'm so glad you came back to me. You've been gone so long. I've missed your terribly. Grandma? May I come in? Grandma? Hey, Grandma. Oh, William, I'm so sorry, I... I must have dozed off. I need to go run an errand real quickly. Um, I'm gonna grab us some dinner too. Uh, is there anything that you want? Do you have any Xanax? No, Grandma. No Xanax. Chicken will be fine then. Who is it? It's the police ma'am, can you open the door? Oh, dear. Good afternoon ma'am, we're looking for Bram Victor. Is he home by any chance? Brian? I don't think I know who that is. Well, we got this address from his work. There was an... accident there last night, and we were hoping to ask him a few questions. See if he knows anything. Well, this is my son William's house. William is my special boy. He finally came back to me and I'm... so happy 'm knitting him some gloves. Is it okay if we come inside and take a look around? I think William would be very upset if he knew his mother was here with two unexpected visitors. Perhaps you can come back another time when he's present. What if I told you we had a warrant to come in anyway. May I see that please? If your son come home give him this. Tell him to give us a call right away, okay? Is this about the cat thing? 'Cause we don't have cats here. Not since '93 anyway. Pussy-free since '93. No, ma'am, this is not about cats. Just take the card and tell him to give us a call right away, okay? Okay then. Have a nice day. You too. Did I ever tell you my little phrase I say to myself every morning before work? What's that? What great new horror awaits me today? Your hands are just so... ...amazing. Um... Thank you. Looks like they've touched many books. Well, yes, quite a few. You don't remember me? I've been in here a couple of times recently. One time was with a girl. Oh, um... yes, and you're also the guy that came in to look for books on amputation. So, you do remember me then, no? Sir, is everything okay? I'm afraid I uh... I have a little crime I gotta confess to you. See the other day I actually left here without checking some books out. And...ugh... I just feel really, really, really bad about it. Well, um... I appreciate your honesty. After all, I am a very honest person. I-I promise. Right...um... well, did you bring it back? It's actually just right out in my car. Did you wanna come with me to go get it? Actually I need to stay here and do my job. But if you wanna go grab it, then we can forget the whole thing. So you're saying you don't wanna come with me? Definitely not. You know, it's just, that there's so much work to be done. Oh, I know exactly what you mean. So... I'll just go to my car and then grab it and be right back, sound good? Okay then. - All right, don't leave that spot. I'll be right here. Shit. Grandma what's this card? The detectives left it. The detectives left it. Detectives? Why would there be any detectives showing up here? William, I'm so happy. You didn't let these detectives inside the house, right? Of course not. Thank God, there's a fucking orgy of evidence here. An orgy? Well that would be un-lady-like for two officers to be in here with me unsupervised. What did you tell them? That they had the wrong place and that I had no idea who this "Brian" character is. Did they say what they wanted? Something about an incident at work? I'll give them a call back in a little bit, let's eat. Honey. Now tell me why you haven't met a nice girl to settle down with yet? Hey. Hey, is everything okay? Aside from Norris being murdered? Let's just say it's been a really weird day. I know, bad question. No, no, that's all right, it's just that... I don't know if I should tell you this. What is it? I saw Bram this morning. You did, where? Down the road after our last shift. And let me tell you, he didn't seem well. How so? Just was his eyes. They looked different, darker than normal. Did he ask about me? As a matter of fact he did. What did he say? He wanted to know if you and I were dating. Sorry. Maybe I should call him. I'm just not sure that's the best thing to do right now. Here we go! What's this? Blood? Turn around Rodrigo. Just go the other way. You know what's at the end of this bloody trail. No! You could be the hero. Just think of what the papers would say. Latino hunk, son of a proud Mexican woman saves a beautiful girl and foils the demented plans of a murderous hand snatcher. Well I say No more snatchin' happenin'. That was a rather dramatic way of getting my attention, wouldn't you say? Your reign of terror ends tonight. Why don't you take the mask off? I already know it's you, Bram. There are cameras everywhere. You just gave herself away. No cameras tonight. Just put down the scissors and step aside, I'll go through you if I have to. I'm gonna give you till the count of three, one, two, three. Rodrigo... They want me to help you set up in Seven. Rodrigo? Verdugo Palm. - I - was wondering how late you were open until tonight? Ten P.M. Oh, so you're closing really soon. Yeah, in about five minutes. So, you're saying if I get there in the next five minutes, you'll still do a reading? Sure. If you can get here by then. Not a minute later. Well then. Knock knock. Hello. Cute. Now what can I do for you? I'd like to get a palm reading. It'll be hard with your hands all wrapped up. Well, yes, there was this... - Accident. - Accident. Yes. I'm afraid I cant remove them. It'll be fine, we'll work around it. Are you paying with cash or card? Cash. Wonderful, please have a seat. You are troubled. I can help you with that. Please, lay your hands on the table. There is something you need. No. It's something you want. More than you've wanted anything before. There is an obstacle. Blocking you from it. You must find a way to separate yourself. What's wrong? I'm not sure. Something dark. There was a careless man who put you in harm's way. That is why you hurt. There was nothing he could do to stop you. There was a woman. She was frightened when you found her. You-you took something from them. More, more is coming in... I see a woman very close to you. She will be afraid- she is afraid. I see her hands. Y-y-you know... I think maybe this is a- a bad idea. What's wrong? It's just that it's... It's so hard to get a proper reading with your hands all bandaged and, and it's so late. Yeah, but you said if I got here before ten and I did, and you said you would do a palm reading so why are you- I'm sorry. Let's just forget the whole thing. No charge. May? Grandma? William, I'm so happy to see you. What are you doing in here? I just wanted to see you one more time. Do you know where you are right now? We're home silly. Grandma. Have you been taking my painkillers? Painkillers? I thought they were my uppers. I mean uh... Blood thinners. Whoopsie Daisy. Are you okay? How was your day? Well... It was very tiring, but also pretty productive. How was yours? Oh, it was just fine. I had to run to the market to get a newspaper. Is that so? What's going on in the world? Oh, nothing good. I read a dreadful article on this hand thief. Awful business. Yes, that is awful. What's that you're working on? Uh, it's...a gift. Oh my. For whom, a girl? Yes. A very beautiful girl. Well I'm very happy that you found someone at last, but I have to say your, your stitching is a bit shoddy. May I? Come then. Oh, this is terribly messy. Here, William. Let me show you. Grandma May, your... your hands are amazing. Why don't you just slip in the shower and get all cleaned up and I'll have this finished for you in no time at all. Oh no, Grandma, you don't have to- Out with you. Off! Bram. Yes. How's it coming? It's done. I have what I need and I'll have it ready for the transplant tonight. We should attempt the surgery at once before necrosis sets in. I understand doctor. Just tell me where to be. Grandma? Doctor? Can I see them? They're magnificent. True works of art. I promise I will not let you down. I took the liberty of picking up some extra blood. Just in case. Thank you doctor. Here. For your troubles. Oh, nonsense. Please, I insist. Okay, put it on the table. - Yeah, it's still in there. - Indeed. Are you ready? Yes. You're a brave man. But don't worry. You're in good hands. Now this works fast. Just breathe deep. Mmhm, it's too bright. How do you feel? I can't feel them. Did it work? That's perfectly normal. The nerves and all the other little bits need time to learn, to play nicely together. Did it work? Let's find out. Up, up! Try and move your hands. Hold them out. Try and move your right Pinky. All right, well that, that's a start, try another. My god. How about the other hand? You're a scientific breakthrough my lad. An absolute marvel. And I'm, sorry I was running low on supplies. I had to use your old bandages. I can't thank you enough, doctor. No, thank you my boy. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Grandma? Let's get you in to bed, okay? Grandma? Thank you Grandma. Hello? Hey, Z, it's Bram. I know I have caller ID. Duh, Sorry. Um, I just want to say good morning. I miss you. Well, it is good to hear your voice. You sound good. I feel good. Better than I ever have. That's great. I'm really happy to hear it. I don't know how else to say it. So I'll just come out and say it. I have a gift for you, and it's going to make everything perfect again. What are you talking about? Please... Just come over for dinner tonight and I'll give you your gift and explain everything. Serial killer? Serial killer. What do you think this guy's doing with the hands? Trophies. Obviously, but I mean, what do you think he does with them? That's disgusting. Is it still considered masturbation If you're using someone else's hand? You know, I had a similar thought about sucking one's own dick. Oh? Well, yeah, is it like sucking a dick or getting your dick sucked? Hey, is that the guy we're looking for? That's him! Wait stop! This is bad. Just look at them... they're a little rough on the inside, but that's okay. Sometime in the past... you had to work really hard... Good morning, Miracle man. How's it going? I think today might be the best day of my life. Really, wow. And why is today so special? It is a beautiful day. My heart is still beating and that makes today just perfect. Gosh, that's just wonderful. I wish all my patients had that attitude. You see what positive thinking can do? Okay. Burned. Lightly irradiated hands. Let me see. Uh, actually, I came in today to just let you know that, I don't think I'll be needing any more therapy sessions. What do you mean? I'm fully healed. See. But how? I still need to do tests on them. Absolutely not. I won't have you poking and prodding at them. You need to let me see your hands. Do you really wanna see them? Yes. Please. Okay, I don't see why not? I don't understand? They're my new hands, Doctor... And they love to cut. Put your hands up. Don't move. Don't you move. Did you just record that? You just shot those cops? Well, yeah, but they were gonna take me to jail. If they took me to jail Then I couldn't give my girlfriend my new hands. Okay, well it was super nice chatting with you, but I gotta keep my heart rate up so I'm gonna go. Don't post that video please. Bram? Can I come in? Why are you covered in blood, Bram? I can't stop. You can't stop what? I killed a woman and two detectives. When? Today. Just now. We've already done the surgery. I know, but I can't stop. You must stop at once! Failure to do so would be disastrous for both of us. My hands just have this urge. To rip. And stab. And cut. Bram, we can figure this out. We can make this right something must've gone wrong. I just have this feeling inside of me. What feeling? The feeling that everything is going to be okay, if I cut off your hands and put them in my freezer. That's far enough. There's not much you can do. I felt this way the other times too. I need to have them. Take one step towards me and I swear to God I'll put through your fucking face. Ssh. Don't you shush me, it is my house. Let me help and we can figure this out together. Thanks for the hand, doctor. My William, I just wanted to tell you how proud I am of you. Grandma, what are you doing inside the TV? You've done a remarkable job so far. Thank you. We need you to kill for us. We need you to bring us their hands. Us? Who's us? Everyone who made you of course. We're all here inside, waiting for you to make us even more proud. But don't I need to stop? People are getting hurt and I could get caught. No you won't. We have made sure of that. You will never face any repercussions of your actions. But promise me you won't stop, never stop. We need their hands. Perfect hands. Place cleans up pretty well. Thanks, I wanted it to be perfect. Oh, what smells so good? I made us dinner. You made us dinner? I didn't even know you could cook. There's a lot of things you don't know about me... You want something to drink? Sure. Wine? So did you finish your literature thing? Yeah... I got an A. What is it? Do you not like it? The food's great. I just... Before things go too far tonight, I just wanted to say that I really appreciate you doing all this. It's really nice... But, I just- Don't finish that sentence, Let's just... stay here a little longer. Okay. How have you been? Bad. I'm seriously considering quitting the lab. What, why? Because everyone keeps getting murdered or maimed there. Oh my gosh. You must not have heard. Both Dr. Norris and Rodrigo. They were killed. It was awful. I opened the door and... he was just in there covered in blood. No hands. I'm... I'm sorry, you had to see that. Well, it's not like it was your fault. Do you wanna go into the living room? I have more wine. I don't know. Come on, I still have to give you your gift too. Well...okay. Now, before you open it, I just want you to know how much I love you, and that whatever happens next, I'll still love you. Okay. Okay. Go on, open it. Those... are my old hands. Your...old hands? Yes. I must admit to a partial ruse though. It's actually a two part gift. Take the bandages off. Go on. Don't be shy. Your hands... They're new. I did it for you. You did this for me? Yes. You're the one that's been taking all the hands... Well, yes, but... Zora, I did it for love. I love them. There are so big. And good. And strong. Come here. You want me to do the thing? That would be perfect. Are you ready? Mmm hmm... Dot. Dot. Stab in the back. Blood running up. Blood running down. Spiders crawling all around. Slight breeze. Slight breeze. Tight squeeze.
