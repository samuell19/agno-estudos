Hurry, they're waiting. I'm bringing the lunch, Monsieur Eduard. You can tell your employers... If you're late again, we'll change supplier. You're five minutes late. If it happens again you're out of business. Let's hope Blanche and Gérard find the way. And I can't wait to finally see your famous castle, after all the stories I heard about it. You seem upset, Mr Shinton. I must confess, the death of Sir Balljanon has upset me deeply... It seems impossible. - I understand... He's left a great void in all of us. Speaking of which, shouldn't his niece arrive today? Yes, and her fiancé is accompanying her. It seems like some friends of theirs will be coming as well. Although I'd prefer not to have strangers in the castle at this point. I would have preferred that as well. In fact, I think it is inappropriate. After all we're not here for a party... ...but the reading of Sir Balljanon's will. I believe they're all quite young. They don't understand such grave moments in life yet. How close were you with Sir Balljanon? - Very close. We worked together for years. I still can't believe he's gone. It's such an unjust world. The good ones are often the first to go. I'm curious what Sir Balljanon's will is saying about the castle. This property he loved so dearly. We will know after we all saw the notary. Of course... I hope you will influence his niece for the best. I'll do my best to convince her to respect her uncle's wishes. But I am just the governess here after all. The benefit of having a two-seater is that you never have to take people with you. Don't let Blanche and Gérard hear that, I'm sure they would have loved to join us. I enjoy every moment alone with you, my dear. Tonight it seems even darker in here. Don't you agree? You may be right, Mr Shinton. Possibly a result of the storms outside. The electrical system needs to be inspected. You know, the castle is very old. That is why Sir Balljanon intended to sell it. He didn't want to spend a fortune... ...in modernisation. Isn't it strange, an admirer of antiques wanting to sell his biggest treasure... This is true. If I owned such a castle I'd never sell it. What would you do with it? It would look after it day and night. How is work? - Not bad, Giuseppe. I don't know how this will end. I heard Sir Balljanon's niece arrived today. Really? - Didn't you know? I was working in the wine cellar all day. Marianne, guests are here, come and help, please. Who knows how she's taken it? Suddenly inheriting such a castle. She won't have to look hard for a husband. Don't you think? - She may have to try even harder. Perhaps. How are your sunsets, Mademoiselle Claudine? A disaster. - Why? Because they're too short and I don't have time to prepare the colours... I'd need two hour sunsets. Why don't you paint our nice village? - Villages are too static. He calls everyday. He must really be in love. In love and very jealous. Who could blame him. Good luck with your sunrises. Please, friends, the discussion about the castle is serious matter for us. After the death of her uncle, Elizabeth is all alone in the world... In her position it is better she doesn't sell anything yet. And, most importantly, she should not rush things. I understand your concerns... But I have to make you aware of something you cannot know. Sir Balljanon had repeatedly mentioned intentions to sell the property. Naturally, he expressed these wishes when he was alive... Before he suspected he was going to die. He had even made specific plans for the sale of the castle. I find it strange that he never mentioned these intentions to me. I would say he was very close to this property. I also find this strange. If he really wanted to sell... He would have mentioned it to me. - But you weren't here, dear. I wasn't, but he could have written. Mr Shinton, don't you think he would have written to me? I am getting the impression that you are questioning my words... Furthermore... ...as to why he didn't tell you. I'd say he had his reasons... ...to not involve you in his plans. - What reasons? I became an orphan when I was ten years old. My uncle was unmarried... ...and with no other family, he devoted his entire life to me. I would've been the first to know if he was selling. Whenever he had to make a big decision... Uncle... ...always told me. Why didn't he tell me this time? He know I was the only benefactor. He cared so much for me... He would never have taken such a decision without telling his niece... Even if, as you say, you were his confidant. I'm not doubting what you say... It may have been a misunderstanding, in good faith. I'm ready to admit it. But I can't admit my uncle with all the affection he showed me... It's superfluous to continue this discussion. Please excuse Elizabeth. She's very tired after today's travelling. The passing of her uncle has clearly upset her more than it appears and this grim discussion has done the rest. If Mademoiselle Carol will accompany us, we'll get some rest. Certainly, with pleasure. Here we are, Miss Elizabeth. This is your room. Since I was a child, I've always used this room. - No, wait. Who is that woman? You're correct. I forgot to tell you. Jeanette is in that room. They told me she was dead. - She might as well be, she's paralysed. She never recovered from the accident she had with your uncle. He came out of it well. Who is this Jeanette? - She was my uncles secretary. She was so full of life. She was also very beautiful. I remember her well. She was very devoted to my uncle. She was quite close to him. - This is why, after the accident your uncle wanted to keep her in the castle, like a member of the family. Even though she was completely deranged. Here's old André, the only person really upset over the death of Sir Balljanon. Let's start, it's already late. Get the wheelbarrow for a moment. Can we borrow the wheelbarrow, André? Yes, but help me take out these pots. - The benefactors have arrived, right? Elizabeth, Sir Balljanon's niece. To think, I remember her as a child. Now, she's arrived with her fiancé... ...and another couple, friends of theirs. - The work is done, who do we give the bill to? There's no one around now. They've gone to hear the reading of the will. We're not in a hurry, as long as someone pays. Contrary to most other cases, the situation here is quite simple... Miss Elizabeth is the sole benefactor of Sir Balljanon's estate. He is very clear about it in his will. There's nothing more to add. It's my duty. In two days you'll have all the documents relating to the property. And I would like to mention that we would naturally want to keep the wonderful governess. Thank you very much, but there's no hurry for decisions like these. Miss Elizabeth is right. This is exactly what Sir Balljanon wrote, regarding this matter: "I would like to thank my faithful governess..." "...who shall continue to look after the castle." I didn't think we would finish so soon. - Me neither. Stop, you. Where are you going? I'm sorry if I startled you. You were walking into quicksand. It's true. The quick sand... My uncle never tired of telling me about it. Now you're the owner, we're neighbours... I live behind there. I've got a small house. It's a beautiful villa. - Nothing compared to your marvellous castle. You'd like to buy it? How did you know? The late Sir Balljanon's governess informed us of your offer. I hope she also told you how much the offer was for? Did my uncle really wanted to sell? - So it seems. He was very interested in my offer. I hope you also take it into consideration... I could present you a contract already. - If you'll permit me to make a remark... This all seems a bit premature. My fiancé doesn't even have the paperwork... ...or knows the value of the castle. - I'm not trying to hurry you. I only wanted to know... - We're neighbours, we can discuss this in time. Thank you, that's all I wanted to know. We'll meet again, I'll leave you to your walk. Thanks for the warning. - You're welcome. Excuse me, is Sir Balljanon's castle this way or that way? That way is quicker but the road is better this way. Are you Sir Balljanon's niece by any chance? The benefactor of the castle? Yes, I am. Do I know you, perhaps? No, but there was a lot of talk about you in our small village. I've been in London all these years. I don't have any friends here anymore... Come and visit, it would be my pleasure. - Thank you, I promise I'll come to see you. I've decided to leave because my presence here is no longer needed. I have business to attend to in London. You know how it is... I don't want to influence your decision... ...but I'd really like you to stay, so you could advise me on the sale of the castle. Do you really want to sell, my dear? Do you need any money? - It's not out of necessity, Mr Shinton. But I'm starting to believe this is what uncle was planning on doing... While I was out walking with Jack, we met a gentleman who had made an offer to uncle. He said uncle was very interested. I do not believe these were your uncle's intentions, Elizabeth. Then why did this gentleman say exactly the same thing as Mademoiselle Carol? I don't know and I don't understand it. Perhaps, when you see certain documents you'll be convinced. I agree. I would be grateful, if you could tell me what you and my uncle found out and what it has to do with the sale. Quite the contrary. But sometimes I believe the governess managed to find out. I'm sorry, I don't understand anymore. Perhaps, when you see the documents I'm talking about, you'll be convinced that you uncle can't have wanted to sell. Naturally, you must know more than me. Let's postpone this discussion to a more opportune moment. That would be better. What is it? What do you want? What happened, Elizabeth? - I don't know, my window opened suddenly. It's nothing. A branch fell off a tree in the storm. You can't stay there with a broken... - What happened? Nothing. - Nothing serious, a branch fell. I hope you're not hurt. What were you doing still awake? I was correcting some articles. - At this hour? Yes, it helps pass time. - Do you always work so hard? Even on holiday? Journalism is a job that never permits holidays. Headquarters? Understood. You frightened me, Monsieur Reynaud. I'm sorry, Mademoiselle, I didn't want to interrupt your moment of inspiration. Why, Monsieur Reynaud, do you always want to joke with me? - That's not true, Mademoiselle... Let me tell you, I honestly like your paintings. - Really? But let's not talk about me. What have you been up to? I haven't seen you around lately. You're very talented. I like this painting. - And you're good at not answering questions. I asked you, why haven't you been around lately? I hadn't given your question enough weight. Because I never imagined... a beautiful woman would be interested in a man like me. Why not? A man who wants to buy Balljanon castle? That's true. It's a detail that might... render me interesting in the eyes of a beautiful woman. But to buy it, it needs to be for sale. - That's also true. But I thought you already had your contacts. Speaking of which, have you met the new owner? Have you seen if she's interested in selling? - I tried to get close to her more than once. But I must confess, I was not successful yet. I'll leave you to your work. Be careful on the stairs. They're wet from the humidity. It seems like time's stopped down here. What's this? What's this mysterious hole? It's nothing important. Just an old tunnel. It must be the ghost's apartment. This way. Don't you remember any of this? - No, absolutely not. I never came down here as a child. - These catacombs are spooky. Yes, and they aren't the worst. Many of them have been sealed up. Be careful, dear. What's in here? - This is a kind of museum. Weapons, instruments for torture. Incredible. It's a very important collection. This one seems alive. It looks like he's breathing. Doesn't it give you ideas? You could write a great thriller. All the characters are here. The weapons you see here were taken in battle around the property. Then these people really existed? - No, they are generic reconstructions. Except for this one, which refers to a person that really existed. A certain gentleman named Robin, who lived five hundred years ago. He was tortured and killed for loving one of your ancestors, Miss Elizabeth. Incidentally, her name was also Elizabeth. These ancient legends always frighten me. - It's one of the many love stories of medieval times. Where love could cost you your life. If love would cost so much today you'd find this story fascinating, - I don't believe it. I do, however. The most interesting part of the story concerns the man's ghost. Very good. All we needed now was a ghost. Shall I prepare your usual not milk with cognac? I'd prefer you bring it later tonight, before I go to bed. And because I'm a bit cold, I'd like it really hot. You don't feel well? I'm rather chilly. - I think you caught a cold in the dungeon. As the story goes, the poor man's ghost often returns to the castle... calling the name of the woman he loved. How do you know this woman had the same name as me? And why didn't my uncle tell me of this strange legend? Evidently, because he didn't want to scare his little niece... That seems logical. But I had to tell you. Because you might hear him calling your name in the middle of the night... and I wouldn't want such a triviality to upset you. Are you trying to say the story is true, and it's not just an old legend? Every legend is based on some truth, but it's not always easy to see the element. This part of truth. However, this part exists. Have you understood, dear? Mademoiselle Carole wants to protect you. - From ghosts, naturally, Mr Jack. How strange. I can sense something, but I don't know what. I don't know. It's as if Mademoiselle Carole is up to something. Telling me that strange story. What does she want? - I don't know. It's just an impression. Perhaps I'm just tired. For me, there's nothing to worry about. It's just an old story about a castle. Perhaps this is why my uncle wanted to leave this place? To leave the castle forever. No, that is highly unlikely. A man like your uncle would never have taken such a grave decision... over a story like that. Don't think about it any more. Let's go for a walk. Yes, I'd love to. I suppose I need to get used to... this atmosphere. All of a sudden, I find myself in this strange place. It's money for us. - What was that? Nothing, it was just the wind. Your nerves are all over the place, my dear. Yes, perhaps. But my nerves were fine until Mademoiselles Carole's story. With that ghost of hers. - Don't pay it any attention. Just think of it as a fairy tale. Doesn't my presence make you feel safe? I'm a fool. It's exactly what we need. I don't think it will work. We need something better. - That substance creates a mental confusion... between nightmares and reality. We need her to be so confused that she doesn't know if she's awake or in a living nightmare. Don't ever question my orders. Do exactly as I say and don't get nervous. I won't doubt you. - You'll see, my plan cannot fail. Wake up. What's wrong with you? - I heard strange sounds outside. Why don't you sleep instead of thinking about ghosts? You're the one who thinks about ghosts. I heard sounds. I really heard them. I try to speak to her sometimes, but it's pointless... Not even a dog should be kept in a room like that. If you think it will make Jeanette happy, I'll go and see her. Shall I take them as well? - Yes, it's always good to take them. Don't tell anyone I've gone to see her. Would you like something to drink? I'd like to know what happened to Mr Shinton? Why should something have happened to him? He told you he was leaving because of his business... and he did. What do you find so strange? I don't see anything wrong. He didn't have anything to do in the castle. It all seems so complicated. You weren't equiped to live in a castle. - He didn't say goodbye. He just left without saying goodbye. You said he told you he was leaving. Perhaps I've misunderstood? In this case, I'm ready to apologise. That's me. It's from Shinton... He says he left too early to say goodbye, and he's sorry. That isn't what I wanted to hear from him. At least you know he hasn't met a terrible fate. You can't see a mystery in every small thing that happens... Otherwise, your life will be hell. Try to be realistic about things. Let's eat. I'm hungry. Please sit down. The food is good here. - Good enough. Ad we can dance... Would you like to dance? I've eaten too much. Are you still thinking about it? - Yes, in fact I am. It's still puzzling me. Let's see... Mr Shinton mentioned to you some documents regarding the castle... Naturally, he couldn't send them in a telegram. Here's a little surprise from the kitchen. - Oh, how nice. And our house wine is very good. - I'd rather not drink this early. This wine won't make you drunk, it just gives you a good feeling... Especially people in love. You must really try it. - If you say so. You can do it, I'll bring the rest. What kind of documents was Mr Shinton talking about? I wish I knew. We need to find out what he wanted to show you when he mentioned those documents. Exactly. He wanted to prove to me that my uncle didn't want to sell. He seems to have in his possession some kind of document which proves it. And he promised to show me these documents... I was expecting something more than just a telegram from him. Okay, I understand. Just give him time. No, I can't wait. I want to know. It's my impatience. The old man's calculations were precise. There's large concentration of uranium under the castle. I've also located the place. - Have you made contact with those people? Yes, and they'll pay a lot more than we thought. But we must hurry. What do you mean? Do you think the new guests are suspicious? I don't think so, but we must be careful. Of everyone, and everything. I will do whatever you say. - Good, then let's proceed with our plan. How do you feel? - Much better. Do you want Blanche to sleep in your room? I must control myself, Jack. Do you want me to stay? I can sleep on the sofa. No, it's really not necessary. I want to test... my courage. Have you decided to stay here permanently? No, definitely not. It's too tedious. I'll never get used to it. The lady is right... It took a long time for me to get used to it, as well. Especially at night. It's as though you can feel the presence of all the past centuries. It can really become a nightmare. And that's not all, you hear so many stories about old castles like this. You're right. I might have a good buyer lined up. Perhaps it's the same person who approached me about buying the castle? Really? Let's see if it's the same person. He's a rich industrialist. You have to admit there is something. I just don't understand it. Listen, if I were you I wouldn't waste time. You wouldn't waste time? This is exactly where they want us. On the defensive. Who would be interested in whether she sells or not? Or who inherited it? From the moment we arrive... It seems like everything has been geared towards getting Elizabeth to sell the castle. This could be... Your impression. Deep down... What has really happened? Nothing. It's just... a woman in shock, due to a series of strange events. Which could be linked to this new environment she finds herself in. I don't see it any other way. In conclusion, you should take her away from here as soon as possible. I agree, but don't forget, she's not my wife yet. Let's have a drink. You're not going to bed, Mr Jack? My father said, when you can't sleep... The only remedy is to go for a walk. - Good advice, there's nothing better. Pleasant stroll. - Goodnight. What's up with you? Why don't you eat? Come on, have some soup. I don't understand what's wrong with this animal. If I were your age. - André, still up? What do you expect, Mr Jack? My work is never done. I was watching this dog. He's become very irritable lately. He refuses to eat. Right, I noticed it as well. All he does is howl all the time. - Especially at night. He's always hanging around the cemetery. If animals could talk, who knows what interesting things they'd tell us. There he goes. He'll go to the chapel door and start howling again. When an animal does these things there's always a reason. Aren't you taking this a little too far? Jack, I beg you. Leave me be. I could never live in a place like this. You asked for me? Yes, because I'd like to speak to Monsieur Reynaud about the sale of the castle. Can you let him know? - Certainly, I'll send Eduard to get him. He's usually at home at this hour. Regardless, Eduard will find him. Take the car and go over to Monsieur Reynaud. Tell him the lady would like to speak to him. Please come and see her. On this occasion, before coming back. Stop off in the village and pick up the groceries. I'm going to the village. Excuse me, but I must send a telegram to the newspaper. I hope to be back in time to see Reynaud. In the meanwhile, keep him entertained. Will you drink a glass of wine with me? No one ever turns down a glass of wine. I haven't been to the village for sometime. When I was young. When I was your age. But now? Regarding the dog. Do you believe in ghosts? Why should I believe such rubbish? I swear I saw a ghost the other night. It was all black. It was running behind the hedge. I saw it with my own eyes. - No, André. Perhaps you drank too much wine? I saw it. But Jeanette? Then you understand me. I'm so happy. Perhaps you can help me... to understand the mystery that has consumed me since I arrived here? I haven't been able to sleep because I see terrible visions every night. It's terrorising me. Horrible people take me and torture me. I can't get any peace. I feel like I'm going insane. I'm scared. I'm scared to be alone. It all started when Mademoiselle Carole told me a story. A terrible story, full of ghosts. Do you believe in ghosts, Jeanette? Why is my life in danger? Write it all down, I beg you. I'll return tomorrow morning... so nobody suspects anything. Make sure it's the good one. - Don't worry, André. It's always the same. How are you, André? I haven't seen you for a while. I would come more often, believe me... But the road is long and I'm too old. - You're still a youngster. Good morning, Monsieur Cordova. Your usual table? It doesn't matter, I only want a beer. A beer for Monsieur Cordova. Is it nice? It's better than the last one. Tell me something... That chap, Reynaud... is that his name? - That's right. What do you know about him? No one knows much about him. We know he's a real gentleman... He doesn't talk about himself. He never gets close to anyone. He's someone who keeps himself to himself. I think he's a good man. I can't think of anything else, for now. Shall I take the provisions to the castle? Didn't Eduard collect the provisions? I haven't seen him for three weeks. The last time I saw him he was going to the doctor. I haven't seen him since. The doctor? - Yes, didn't you know? He had to see him urgently. He cut his hand on a hook... and he couldn't stop the blood. It was a bad wound. Please send him my regards. It should have healed by now. I haven't heard anymore. I don't understand that fellow. He could've mentioned it. Instead, he kept it quiet. Could you give me the doctor's address? It's at the end of the road, the last crossing. You can't mistake it. There's a sign. Will you come with me, or do you want to stay here? I'm quite comfortable here, I'll stay. Then Ill walk home myself. We must stop Jack tonight. Take care of it. Tonight. I don't think it was so serious. Otherwise, he would've come back. It was a bad wound. Very deep. Didn't he mention it to you? - If it was such a deep wound his hand would've been bandaged. - Yes, but that's not the important thing... He should have come back to take out the stitches. But I haven't seen him since. He must have seen someone else. Excuse me doctor, could a wound that serious have had more serious consequences? If it's not treated properly it can lead to a nasty infection. However, his hand should've been bandaged. Thank you, doctor. - You're welcome. Thanks for your help. - It's nothing. Hands up, and don't move. There's someone who wants to talk to you right away. Don't try any tricks and I assure you nothing will happen to you. How are you? - I'm sorry to disturb you like this, but Miss Elizabeth can't see you now. She asks you to postpone the appointment and accept her apologies. Of course. - It's nothing serious, just a strong migraine. For the rest, the question of the sale can be discussed tomorrow. I hope this is fine for you? Well, I was told the owner wanted to see me. I understand. - Send her my regards. Please get in contact with me as soon as she's better. Of course. - For now, all I can do is hope Elizabeth gets well soon. What are you doing here? Tell me what's going on. Show me where your owner is. Come on, show me where he is. Where's your owner? Find him, Black. Your owner is nearby, right? Show me where he is. Where's your owner, Black? Here? Is he in here? Where's your owner, Black? What are you doing here? The same thing as you, Mr Seaton. Only, I'm here on official business. I'm with the National Police. We're looking for a Stephane Barkos. He's a dangerous criminal. Go upstairs, Jack. It's for the best. I'll be with you as soon as I find certain documents which should be here. Very well. - By the way, Jack. Mr Shinton, who was working with Sir Balljanon on uranium research was found dead in the river. I thought as much. How is your hand? You cut it on a hook twenty days ago. You never injured yourself because you aren't Eduard. You should never have got involved. - Shoot, if you want everyone to come here. That man is Stephane Barkos, Mr Seaton. I found the documents I was looking for. I'm glad... ...but I would like to to know who Stephane Barkos was. Who invited you? - Someone who's going to be inviting you soon. You can let go of him. It's the fourth time he's changed his name. It was all going well, but this time he made the mistake of changing his face. Something he could only do with the complicity of Mademoiselle Carole. We know Sir Balljanon had discovered uranium in the foundations of the castle. As soon as we heard of his premature death, we knew the two events had to be connected. Take off his mask, Jack. What should we do now, my love? I can't live in the castle by myself. You won't have to live here alone. There will be two of us.
