I like the woods. Always have. You don't get me wrong, I like to be indoors in a nice fluffy bed as much as anyone... More than anyone probably. I've heard them say 'it's the simple things' we should appreciate most. And right now, it's the wind in the trees and the smells in the air... this place has magic. And people now a days, are way too concerned with their shiny, tiny beeping machines, than they are with the simple joys of living. And sometimes, I'm compelled to come out to this place and do a little... 'meditation' they call it... or 'communing' with nature... or just letting the magic guide me. Because I help people... even if they don't know they need help. Because, as I've discovered... people need all the help they can get. That thing is hideous... what was I thinking... Vroom... Vroom, beep-beep... Why do you always do that, Dad? You used to love that when you were a kid. You're home early. It's over. What's over? The company. We sold the websites, the interface, the code I worked half my life on... Sold myself out of a job. Now they say i have enough money to retire. Didn't you already have enough money? That's what they say. That's why it feels so weird. So, what happens now? I don't know, guess I'll hang out here at the house for awhile. Maybe we can spruce it up a little bit. Wait, Didn't you hire a decorator. Won't they get mad? Well, it's our house... I don't know! Maybe we could go on those trips we talked about. What trips? Maybe we could just hang out ... You know, I could learn how to cook... Well, I've got a lot of summer reading to catch up on. Maybe we'll order pizza later. Ya... that'd be good. Hello? Hi. Is this Chris Barber? From Mr. Garvey's class? Um... no... I mean, ya, it is I was in Mr. Garvey's class last year... but... yeah... OK... anyway, Um, I needed to raise English grade and he suggested you could tutor me? He did... I mean, Ya, he mentioned that thing with me tutor of you... ya. So... can you? Can I what? Tutor me this summer? In English? That's the idea. Oh, Ya, ya. I mean i'm good at English... So.. Are you sure? Ya, sure... I'm sure... why did somebody say something? I was kidding. Anyway, um, text me your address. I can come over tomorrow and we can work out a schedule. My parents can't pay much... That's uh. Come on, No payment necessary. no shoes, No shirt,, no service. Haha.. What does that mean? I guess... I,,, will see you tomorrow., uh.. Ok cool, thanks bye. I am so lame.. Ha.. what in the world am I going to do... Frannie she is going to be here... tomorrow. What was that...? Kitty? Hey, dad? Yeah? Did we get a cat? No. Why? What do you do when you like a girl? Uh, Well uh, Oh... I did see a cat. That one. Ya, Me too. Weird right? Hey , let's go order that pizza Huh ? Yeah. I'd like that. Has anyone seen my shoes? Ohh.. Seriously, I've got to start setting up at the Simms cocktail party and there not going to want to see my toes. They're our best customers, they deserve toe-free appetizers. Did you look in the kitchen? Ya, they're not there. Hey, mom? Yes, Tina... and no, you can't go to business college. But mom, I didn't even say which one. It doesn't matter which one. Just face it, you are too brilliant and smart for your own good. We can't afford it. I promise we will looking for scholarships over the summer. Ok.. This is so unfair. My website would make a lot of money. I'm sure it would, but right now your mom can't even afford visible footware, so, I'm sorry. Quite bugging mom about business college. Why don't you shut it. Why don't you shut it, you're the annoying one. No, you're the one who doesn't even know what he's going to do with his life. At least I have direction and purpose. And if you only had a personality, you might have a future. I hate you, Trent. Ditto.. Can you guys give it a rest and help me find my shoes Ok, or I won't feed you this week. Aren't they outside on the porch? Oh... right. Thanks, Trent. Suck up. Loser Slacker.. Nerd. A little help here. Ok, There's more in the fridge and I don't be home to late. Hi there. Is it a cat? Four paws, kinda furry . Yep, I think so. Wonder what it wanted? My stinky shoes apparently. Can you put that car for me sweetie heart. Ya, Thanks.. Of to work. It's a lot of work to do what I have to do. Not many people realize that. Yes, we're all connected, but it takes real magic to connect the right people at the right time. But it can be hard sometimes. Because people can be stubborn and silly and sleep right through the best parts of life. I try not to let that happen. I'm Duffy. And I'm a human whisperer. And I think I've found the people I'm supposed to help. Dad! Dad, what's going on! It's fine. Just the smoke alarm in the kitchen. Nothing to worry about.. Is everything ok? Ya, Just had a little hiccup with the waffle maker this morning. What happened? I can't make waffles! And a now were going to have to get a new waffle machine and I'm going to buy one that comes with directions. Dad... seriously? So what's this with your, uh, shirt? Frannie's coming over... any minute. Oh. Who's Frannie? The girl in my class I told you about. The one who needs English tutoring. Oh ya.. Well listen, this place smells like burnt waffles . So, Why don't you go out by the pool. I'll bring you some juice. Ok, I'll be out there. Just don't bother with the juice. or... Oh ... So you don't want the old man to mess up your girl time. Huh.. Gross. Hey, listen you go up stairs, finish getting ready. I'll go and take care of the table outside. Oh, hey kitty. So, you decided to come back huh.. I had to. You need my help... and not just in the kitchen. Come here! What did you burn in there anyway? I could smell it out... ooooh... ahhhhh... yesssss... "Let's see. What does it say , Duffy." I'm Duffy.. It's Duffy !! Ya, But there's no address. Who told you to stop rubbing my ears? Huh.. I don't remember my first owner very much... Ok well maybe you can get some sun out here! Huh.. And if you could grab me a bowl of milk... That would be great. I should probably follow Phil inside, but there is seriously nothing more wonderful then a cat nap... that's why they call it that, you know. Wow... You have a really nice house. Thanks. Does it always smell like waffles? Um... No. Um, follow me and we can go outside. Ok.. Wow... this is beautiful. Oh, Hey, is this your cat? No. I don't even know what he's doing here. I heard that. Aww, I like cats. Oooh, cats like you too. Ya, he's cool I guess. Me and My dad were actually thinking about getting a cat. Nice backpedal, kid. This is so nice. I mean, you must be out here all the time. Uh... yeah... sometimes. Not true either. So, you're having trouble in English? Yeah. Well, I'm not really into reading... books. But, your in Honors classes? yeah, Well, Uhh, just because I had, like help and stuff. Oh. So, I need help. From you. Ya, I can do that. Um, Are these the ones you want to start with. Yeah. Well there's a whole required reading list. It's in the first book. I kinda need help with what's going on. So, you don't read at all? Why, when there's movies and TV. Maybe we could make it fun. How's that? Uh, you could explain to me what's going on in the books while I swim in your pool? I don't, Ummm... I mean, it seems a shame to waste it. Let's make learning fun. Ok, well.. How about i take look at the list and these books and i just work out a times schedule and you know? Ok.. Oh... OK? What the heck, cat? Don't look at me. I may be here to help you humans, but explaining your irrational behavior is beyond me. That was horrible... What was that all about... Duffy? I'd say Chris isn't so experienced expressing his affection... or talking to a girls... or dealing with humans at all really. Take your pick. Well, I don't know what it was, but I hope everything works out. I'll do my best This is what retirement is all about.. Huh.. I am bored.. Wow... That sure was random... Not really, Phil, but I'll give you another day before I spring that on you. Hey, Chris... did you let the cat in? I came in myself, by the way. Not that hard. So, Duffy? What should I do? Feed me? Little warm milk? Maybe some sandwich meat? Hey, You look like you might be hungry. You want me to find you something to eat. Wow... I am good. Sure, buddy, let's eat! Nom, nom, nom, nom.... Did someone mention my name? Ah, nevermind... nom, nom, nom... Haha.. So you like that, Duffy? Huh... You let the cat in? Oh, I thought you did. No. You probably shouldn't feed it. Well, Why not? He doesn't belongs to us. You think his owner's going to be happy with you feeding him? Well, I don't know. Well, you should probably see about taking him back. Well I looked on his collar. There's no address. You really don't like him? He just doesn't belong here, that's all. No uses in getting attached to something that's not going to stick around. Chris... ...nom, nom, nom... Chris...? Chris...? Chris...? OK, Duffy, I guess we're going to have to find out where you need to go. Duffy? The Simms shindig went well? Ya. They're such nice people. Why don't you think about asking them for a internship? They make toys. Barf. Wow... when did you become so jaded. I'm not jaded. I just know what I want. Unlike some people. I heard that. Of course you did. What about you, Trent? What about me? Why don't I ask the Simms about an internship for you? How much does it pay? I don't know. ... Goofus. No, you're a goofus, actually. Besides, toys and stuff is for people with imaginations and creative type stuff. You don't have any. I'm gonna fix that loose fence. Thanks sweet heart, I always feel like I'm going fall right threw it. Suck up. That's me. Mhm.. I got start the cheese puffs. You want to help? ...In a minute. Saved by the bell. I do not like these silly machines... but they can be useful at times. Hey, you don't really think you have nothing to offer, do you? Not really, no. Well good because, You are wonderful Son and you're smart and you can do what ever you want. And I have no idea what that is. Well, It takes time. I know. I just don't want to take an internship or anything else when I don't know what I want. There's gotta be tons of people who'd love to have an internship at a toy company. People with magination to offer. Hey, You have allot to offer. Thanks, mom. Ka, you'll figure it out. Don't let your sister get you down. I don't... Good. Because, I love you and I'm proud of you. ...Well, did he say anything else? Cause I totally think he likes you. Guys are like clueless like that. You just have to keep at it... I know... I know... I know... ...well, you know how Derek was, that's why you broke up with him... You want something different... hey, I gave you the idea... I know... I know.. I know.. Right... Um, there's one thing you don't know... which is I'd really like you to look at your beeping machine... ...Well, let me know, Just I think you have to keep at it... probably.. I know... I know... I know... OK, goodbye. I am such a good friend. Read your beeping machine. Who said that? Trent? Are you messing with me? It's not Trent. It's me. You're a cat...? Read your machine. And you're talking...? How...? Who? What? Tina. Yes? Tina, Please read your machine. My computer? Yes. Why? I said 'please?' Yes... but you're a cat? I'm a cat with good manners. So, please read your machine. I can only speak to you once. It's the rules. OK. I will. Thanks... right... MOM! There's a cat in here. I know there's a cat in here... it was just talking to me! Why is there a cat in here? It just is; did you not hear what I just said... it was talking to me! Here kitty, kitty.. Maybe it's hungry. Should I get some milk? No... it talks, like, it doesn't just meow, it was just talking to me; like words, sentences, languages... out loud... to me! Tina, just calm down, ka, you're scaring the cat. I'm scaring the cat?! It was just talking to me! Where's your brother? Huhh... Ohh kitty, kitty. So cute.. This is why you have no imagination! A talking cat! That's just stupid! That's the best you could come up with? That doesn't even make sense, you moronic oaf! I didn't even do anything... What is going on? Where's the cat? He's gone. He left when you started yelling and slamming doors. What is going on, Tina? Ask my brother. Whatever, Trent... Hey.. How goes the cheese puffs? In the oven. How's the fence? Sturdy. Are you ok? You seem a little down. I'm fine. Hey, you wanna watch a movie marathon with me. I taped it last night Humphrey Bogart. You'd love it, lots of dastardly deeds, danes and daring-do. Sounds cool, but maybe Another time. I'm going for a walk before it gets too dark. You ain't no good, see.. You know, I hate to do this to you but...I might have to fill of lead, see.. a man's gotta do what a man's got to do, Hahaha You like Humphrey Bogart movies too? Huh, Duffy.. Sure. Your impression is terrible, but the movies seem good. Not enough cats though. Duffy? What am I going to do? Try taking a long walk into the woods. Yeah, I thought about taking the trails Over but.. Is somebody in here? Just us lazy, old movie-watching types. Duffy? You should take a walk in the woods. What's going on here? And then have a talk in the woods. Why are you... talking? Well, because I have one chance to. And I thought now might be good. You can talk... but only once? I don't make the rules, Phil. No... No, I don't suppose you do... But, hold on a sec... OK... but just remember what I told you. Right, walk, talk in the woods... But you stay there.. .. Right there.. Chris... Chris... Chris... Chris... Chris... Chris... Chris... What happened? Did you burn something in the kitchen again? No, Come here quick. You got to come... Don't get all angry! What's going on? Don't worry about it? Just come here... Why's the cat on your bed? Well, he kind of came back in, So Duffy and I were watching Some old movies together... weren't we, Duffy? Go ahead, Duffy, tell Chris what you told me. are you OK, dad? Ya, i'm fine... Go ahead tell chris! Uhhh.. Well he was just talking to me.. Ya.. He said, Meow? Now wait a minute.. I can't go stir-crazy after just one day? Huh.. Short answer: yes. Long answer: yes. Now i'm going back to my room. What's your deal, cat? A new day... A new day to start over.. Phil two-point-oh. Ya, wonderful day to start again.. And I'm going to stop talking to stray cats, because that makes no sense at all... But, then a little walk in the woods wouldn't hurt. In fact it But, then a little walk in the woods wouldn't hurt. In fact it would be good to clear my head. Right! And I just thought about that idea right at this very moment.. Right! This is really nice out here... Who would have thought. Right across the street... Hey, loser. Don't try to prank me today. You don't have it in you. I'll pretend like I know what you're talking about. Yeah, right... you stay dumb, I'm off to the library to work on my proposal. Cause I'm smart. And you're not. Yeah, I know, I got it... blah blah blah you're boring. Is Tina head off to the library? Yeah. Are you OK? Yeah... just going for a walk. Hey, You know I'm always here if you need to talk. I know. Thanks mom. What's up with you, cat? I'm a talking cat, but I can only talk to a person once. And there's a collar my original owner gave me, buried under a grove of magical trees due north of here. It's near a big fallen tree and just through a thick hedge that looks like a fuzzy green wall. That collar is what lets me help people. That's... crazy? What's so crazy about it? You're a cat. You're a human. And one with quite an imagination, despite what your sister says. How do you know that? I don't even know what I'm going to do with my life. That's the problem with you humans, you're all so concerned with knowing the destination, you forget to enjoy the trip. What does that mean? Not sure. I heard on a TV once. But that thing doesn't really interest me. My sister knows what she wants. And we're twins. So you have to take the same path? No... but, I don't know what I want to do. She's right, I have no imagination. You know how I know that's not true at all? How? You're having a thoughtful conversation with me. I'm a talking cat, remember. That just makes me crazy. You just need to stop selling yourself short. If you keep living and learning and reaching out, the life you think you're missing is going to land right in your lap. Yay.. Maybe you're right... Forget, I have plenty of imagination... Wow.. I need to get out more.. I haven't done this much walking in for ever ... I should have brought some water. Hi... Oh, hi... I'm sorry, I just talking a walking in the woods and guess, I got a little bit... Lost? Mugged? I'm sorry, I'm not much for hiking... Not yet anyway. Would you like some water? I hate to bother, but that would be great. But, You're not a crazy person right ? No offense. My son says I am. I don't think So, So, I guess the jury is still out. my name is Phil.. Susan...nice to meet you. Um, come on in.. Well, Thank you. So, do you live nearby? Ya, Up the canyon, 817 Ocean View. Wow, that's a swanky neighborhood up there. They say it is.. My son doesn't think so. Oh you have a son, How old? Chris well he is 17. Going on 67. I have twins, that age. A boy and a girl. They are a little bit of a handful. But there good kids. I see you and your husband has done a fine job. Oh I'm not married. Never have been. Oh, I'm sorry... I didn't mean, well, Chris' mother she left him with me... it's kind of awkward. Anyway.. Your place is really nice. It's very homey. Well, If by 'homey' you mean small And Needs work then thank you. Oh, no... Not at all. It's really nice. Thank you. I Did it all myself. Really I'm not much for decorating, I had someone else do my place. So now I live in a place that Had someone else's taste... and I got to tell you there taste is pretty awful. Haha, Why don't you make it your own? Well I don't have much taste, I mean, Look at me, I look like something the cat dragged in... No you don't, you look nice. Well thank you, You're too, too kind. I know I spent a lifetime in windowless office buildings drinking coffee. I'm no Humphrey Bogart. Oh my god.. I love Humphrey Bogart. I taped the marathon that was on last night. You saw that too. It was great. What's your favorite Bogart movie? Wow, There's so many.. I have them categorized Um. By genre and some by co-star. And they call me OCD. Well you have to there's so many... There's the war-related stories, the detective stories. What about the love stories? Well, I like those too. They kind of creep up on you. They do. That's true.. I am too good sometimes.. Wow, dad, you look terrible. Well, I just took a little walk. To where? Mordor? No... just down the hill... and threw the woods... Maybe I did get there. Well, Frannie's going to be here soon. How's the tutoring going? It's OK... she gets this stuff more than she lets on, I think. Girls are weird. Ya, they are... but they're pretty cool too.. Yeah... Kind of hard to figure out though. Yeah... So I think I'm going to take another walk again tomorrow. OK? Yeah, you're right, I'm going to take another walk again tomorrow. I didn't say anything. Hey, I'm going to take shower and Maybe we can go get some Chinese later on. OK... So, Hamlet is a story about what? A guy. Named Hamlet. Who... likes ham? Two out of three is not bad but there's a little more to it than that. You seemed to know more yesterday though.. I know, but it's just so hot. Do you think we could go swimming... please? I don't think... we should go swimming.. I mean, you can go. It's fine. Don't you want to swim with me? I'd like to... love to, but I just don't think we should break client / tutor privilege.. by which course I mean not have any privileges... OK. It's ok, I understand. I don't want you to freak out. I like you take things seriously. But you don't have to all the time with me. OK... Hamlet is a Story about a guy who can't take action even though the obvious is staring him right in the face. Um... yeah... good... yeah... yeah... It's OK to ask for help. Did you just...? If it means anything, I don't like the water at all... except if I stick my paw into faucet... feels so weird... and I drink from the toilet sometimes. Don't tell anyone. Oh, I... can't swim. I know. I don't know what to tell my dad... If you can talk to a cat, you can talk your dad. Ya, but we don't have anything in common... Ya, We both talked to a cat, didn't you? And the cat talked back. Didn't it.. That's... weird. True. True But so is life. It will never stop being weird. Chris, don't let one setback stop you from taking advantage of an opportunity. If you need help, ask for it. Duffy, do you think Frannie likes me? Duffy? Duffy? Well I guess me and my dad are crazy. Together. That's kinda cool. Hey, that sounds great, it really does. No, Short notice is fine, especially with an opportunity like this. Thank you and thank Tom.. Ya, good luck tomorrow. Yep, I'll ee you then, thank's. You guy's that was Winnie Simms. She's got a big client coming in tomorrow. She want's to pull out all the stops. And If help her land this client, She's going to put us under contract. Wow, What's that mean? That, means a regular job, Regular paychecks and maybe moving to a bigger house. Can I help? I'm going to have to loading up everything in the car. Could give it a clean out? Sure. Tina? Yeah, good luck, mom. Look at me. I'm doing breakfast and lunch, so I'll need you to juggle a few things with the ovens the morning. Maybe even prep the cheese puffs; they were a special request. Sure, No problem. So if anyone needs me, I'll be in the kitchen most of the night. Don't mess this up for mom like you messed up your face. Funny, Slacker McNoLife. You can't make me feel bad anymore. Whatever. Weirdo. Duffy! Duffy! Trent gonna make you talk again today? Cause that didn't make any sense... and I'm not sure how that story on the coding guy came up on my computer... Tina.. Are you talking to me.. No mom... Duffy's back. Oh, The cat.. I don't think he should spend the night. He's not ours. OK. I'll let him out. This'll be our little secret. I do need to speak with your mother... she's the last person I need to speak with...

I really did want to talk to you. What about your mom? Oh, She'll be fine... this is business. Just keep walking and I'll tell you all about it. Hi, mom. You want a sandwich? Where's your sister? Not here. She didn't make cheese puffs did she? Nope. And she left her cell phone here. Is she in trouble? Ya... Sweet No. Not sweet. The investor meeting is not going well and I don't got cheese puffs. I'm sure the Simms will understand. it's not the point, I wanted everything to be perfect and it isn't and I don't know where she is I'll find Tina. You go make one batch of Cheese puffs. You can do that before they're finished, I'm sure. Ok, Ill do that just get your sister back here. Sure. She's in trouble. This will be awesome. You know where she is? I have a pretty good idea. Wow, those cheese puffs smell amazing. It's my mom's recipe. You didn't have the cheese she usually uses, but it should be OK. She won't be as mad... hopefully. You did tell her you were coming here. Right? Oh... yeah sure.... And I have my phone so... what do you think about my idea? Well, I got a buddy that has a similar engine... change up the algorithms...Get a list of variables get some get some recognition software... Uh, change.... It's a thumb drive. I've been working on the math for a long time. I think I have the right list of variables and the basics for an algorithm, but I need help... You are just a teenage girl right? You're not like any teenage girl I've ever new.. We can be nerds now too. Yes, you can. So, will you take a look at it? If I can snag a some of those cheese puffs before they get out of here.

Who are you? Oh, sorry, I'm Trent. Tina's brother. Who's Tina? Um, I think she's here.. Cooking something by the smell of it. I didn't think that was my dad. Didn't smell anything burning. Hey, do you think I could take a swim? I walked up the hill and it looks like the best thing I've seen in a long time. Sure. I was just getting out. There's some extra towels and gym shorts in the cabana... ...or you could just jump in. You must be out here every chance you get. Ya, Sure.. I would kill to have a pool. I love to swim. I taught swimming and was a lifeguard couple years at a kids pool, just so I could swim. Do you think you could teach.. Non-kids how to swim? Sure. No problem. But I may have to come over a lot this summer make sure the pool is up to snuff. Sure, whatever you need. As long as I can swim without sinking. Um... sure. That's the easy part. Get in. Cheese puffs wafting across the pool deck, two families enjoying each others gifts... yes, things are working out much better. These cheese puffs are the best.. Thanks. What about my data sets? Now, This is all really impressive, Tina I want to see what I can do with this. Really? Ya, I think you've got a great future... I have no future... I'm doing it... That's it.. I'm doing it... Keep loose, don't fight against the water... relax... nice job..... Uh-oh... Oh... I'm so sunk... Susan! I forgot Susan! Susan, Hi. You forgot this. When you left home without my permission? Mom, I can explain... Well, I thought you said everything was OK? Phil here is a business guy and he told me he could help me with my project and career, so... So, what? I needed you to help me with the business that provides food and clothes and roof over your head and forgive me if I still get to be your mother. Well how did the meeting go? Not so good. The investor declined. Well that happens... It's not your fault, mom. Yaa... Yes' what? Yes... I'm... sorry? And where have you been? Swimming, Your in trouble by the way.. And so are you by the way. I was just doing what you told me too.. Ya, swimming with your friends? Well maybe I can explain... OK, go ahead. Explain. Come on, Phil, pull this one out don't let my hard work down... I'm... sorry? No, Phil, that's not acceptable. I expect more from my kids and you know what, but I barely know you. Well, then, maybe... we should hang out sometime... Your ask me out? Now? Well of course not what, I... I mean not that I wouldn't ask you out.. I mean your very pretty Dad, please stop rambling. That's not fair, Mom. I was just --- This was going so well... This is all Tina's/ Trent's fault anyway... Enough! Tina, Trent, get in The car. We'll talk about this when we get home. Phil, you may very well be a nice person, but in the future take your walk along a different trail. I know I can fix this. I just need to talk to Susan. Paws don't fail me now. Thank's. So do you like that woman? Susan? Ya I did.. You shouldn't let one little set back stop you from taking advantage Of an opportunity.. Alright then well I'll try not to. But I'm going to need your help How! Come here! Susan's daughter, Tina, she's invented an application that catalogs your wardrobe into a database, then offers you suggestions on outfits. It also suggests things you can buy in specific price ranges to augment those outfits... it's all pretty impressive. But we're dudes... and pretty sloppy dudes to.. Ya, We just a change a few of the parameters. Ready to give it a try? Frannie's coming by later. I guess we should get started. Come here! Here! That's it.. Let's get this.. Do you need me to... Ya right there.. Scanned in.. Yep.. Scanned in.. Yep.. Scanned in.. Yep.. Scanned in.. Yep... Scanned in.. Ok... Alright.. So what choices do we have.. What about a purple and pink tie with balloon pants.. Ya I'm not sure about that, Frannie,the purple and pink.. That's a little much dad. Just about done.. Great .. You know we look good. We do. You should develop that girls program. You know. Tina doesn't know it yet, but she's going to one very wealthy young lady. Cool.. That's Frannie. I'll get out of your way. Hi, Frannie. Hi, Chris... you seem... different. Oh... didn't notice. Anyway, I was wondering... since it's little hot outside if you might wanted to swim first and study second. I'd like that. Man, that's a long trip, but I can fix this. I know I can. MacBeth and his Lady would be a lot less ambitious if they had a pool to lounge in. I think you're right. I don't want to bug you, But thought you might want some lemonade. Thank's dad.. Is this yours.. Ya.. Hey... really? Oh, no... that's terrible. I'll get my mom to give me a ride over right away.. Is everything OK? My friend was looking after a stray cat, the one you had here the other day Duffy. Well she got hit by a car by their place. It doesn't look good. What's going on? I think we are going to give your friend a visit.. Right now. Susan, were sorry to come by like this, but we where told about Duffy. We were in side... And we heard a car slam on a brake's. We found them.. The vet has made him comfortable but.. We put him in my room... Do you mind? Ohh... Ohh... Ohh... He's a good cat... Ya, He is.. Ohhhh.. I don't know what it is about that cat. It's like he spoke to all of us... Why are you all looking at each other like that? Duffy, He... Spoke to all of us? I don't understand. What do you mean.. He did that... maybe there's some magic left in the collar... What are you talking about? Did Duffy tell you something? Yes, he was making a point... he said he had a collar hidden near a grove of trees. We all know Duffy's special, right.. So maybe it all makes sense that collar might be able to save him... Anything! We have to do something. Let's go. Are you all crazy? Yes we are. So where do start? North of here. If this works I'll never be mean to you again. Sure you will. What is going on here? Duffy... he's special. You are too. Duffy the cat ... Spoke out loud to all of you? Ya you are probably going to think that we are crazy and all of us should be put away. But if there's one chance in a million this crazy goose chase that we're on .. is going to save that cat.. It's worth it.. OK... I think the hedge Trent talked about is up OK... I think the hedge Trent talked about is up here behind that fallen tree. Over here, I think this is it. Are you ready see what's on the other side.. Got it! What happened? We did... something. I'm Duffy i'm a talking cat.. Now, I know you have a lot of questions. But there are some things even a cat - sure, even one as smart as I am, can tell you. Susan got her contract with Simms Toys after all. Seems some new investor person appeared out of nowhere. It was months before Phil and Susan realized they had even more things in common... and by then, they'd grown quite fond of each other. Tina's fashion advice thingee become a big deal for Phil's new development company. I still don't get the fascination with the beeping machines, but it makes them both happy. Cannon balls. The others... well, they're Still figuring out who they are and what they want... but they've taken to the cat way of doing things, which involves lots of curiosity, playing and napping... OK, maybe it's just me that likes to nap, but I find it helpful. Maybe my collar gave me one of those nine lives I'm supposed to have. I don't know. But my new family -- the family I feel I'm going to stay with -- believed enough in me to come together on my behalf... and that's almost enough to make a cat get emotional. Almost.
