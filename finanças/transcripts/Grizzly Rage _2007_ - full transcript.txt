Our luck was bound to run out sooner or later. Yeah. And this was supposed to be the beginning of everything. Hey, you know, I was thinking, um, do you remember that partythat uh... that Ollie had? Yeah. Well, I actually borrowedmy mom's Volvo that night. When we started to get intothe shooters and all that stuff, I figured I'd just leavethe car there and walk home and come back and get itin the morning. But, of course, the second I'm out there, I'm, like, the last thingthat I wanna do is walk home and then come back and get it in the morning, right? So, I'm coming down the driveway, and the first thing that I do is back straight into a parked car. But the kicker is that instead of getting out and dealing, I, uh... I just hightailed it out of there. And it turned out to besome neighbor's car. You just wish that you, like, said something, or did something at that moment. I just kept putting it off, and, um, eventually, I just figuredit would be betterjust to leave well enough alone. And I just... I just really regret that. Why are you telling me this?
