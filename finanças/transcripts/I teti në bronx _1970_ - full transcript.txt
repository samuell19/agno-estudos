THE EIGHTH IN BRОNZE Artist, shall we go? We have to climb this hill. It's just a bust. -We will carry it. Alma, you will get tired a little. If we had notified the villagers, they would have brought a mule here. Shoulders are safer; Xhemal. This is a bust. It'S no joke. Comrade teacher? -Yes? We can take it to the mill by cart. Okay, Rustem. But, where can we find it? There is a road being built near here. The villagers transport stones with carts. I am going to get one. Let's rest for a whilfe, comrades. Wait, wait! Wait! Muhamet ’ha’s got something for all of you. Please, move out of the way! Move out of the way! Move! Mf. Mazllum? -Welcome, Ibrahim! I .have been here. Welcome and I hope your trading goes well. You have been sweating. Trading is getting you to sweat? What can you do, Mr. Thoma? There is a big crisis going on. Wars are destroying us. Everybody has exploited these poor people. There isn't any salt around here. There is no bread in the city. I thought to bring here some salt, and some other jingles to exchange them with some wheat. This way, I can. help these poor people, and also, I can satisfy the city people with some bushels of wheat. Bring out the otheY sack. -I've got only salt. We can see. Move! Salt! Salt! Tho'se who have taken salt shouldn't wait here. Salt! We want salt! Salt, Mr. Teacher! Salt! Don't make a fuss! The whole village will get salt. Only one person per house should some here. Here, take half an oke. -Аll right, son. Here are the money. -Go, now. There is no need to pay. Please, Mr. Ibrahim! You are ruining me. The salt is for the people. The sea belongs to the people. The sea belongs to everybody. -Please, Mr. Teacher! This salt wasn't taken from our sea. I bought from a greek merchant in Thessaloniki. The sea there belongs to everybody, too. What are you waiting for, Fatmira? I just gave your mother half an oke. Don't give anymore salt to her, Mr. Ibrahim. Mr. Mazllum gave her one arid a half oke. Aren't you ashamed to ask again for salt, Shabagice? What should I be ashamed for? I bought it with my own money. Only you should get salt for free? Yeah, right! Bring'me that one and a half oke. I will give you your money back. will give foalf'an oke for free. What is going orp here? Well, well, well! The commissars are trading salt?! Take the sack and get on your way. The s'alt Was distributed. Come back tomorrow to take the paraffin cans after we distribute them around the village. -Please, Mr. Ibrahim! You are taking away my children's bread! Your children are safe and sound, Mazllum. Who will pay me for the salt? Here. When Albania will be free, bring this note to us to get paid. We don't have any money now. -I had 100 kilos not 90. Give it to me. Save it, Mazllum! Save it! Save. it,r Mazllum!/ Save it! Don't let Bamke Qylollaiji see it, because he will report you to Sali Protopapa. Who knows where Sali Protopapa is getting around with the Germans? Really. How did this scumbag, Sall, get together with’ the Germans? He has always acted this way, the same as other Ballists/ When we were fighting Fascism, Sali Protopapa and his goons went around the market as hounds! He used to say that the circumstances weren't the right ones to fight. When the Germans came, he got together with them. As soon as they stepped in Albania, they burned Borova to the ground, and killed women and children. Even the goddamn Germans will get what they deserve. This will happen, when we all get a riffle to fight. We have already got our riffles, Mr. Teacher. Be careful with what you say, Hajr. -I'm not saying anything wrong. Then, say "comrade teacher." You should call Sali Protopapa a "mister!" Have you seen Braho? I haven't heard from him. My wife has been very sad. -He is in the first,brigade. Which one is bigger, the battalion or'the brigade? You are such a moron I If the battalion was bigger, why should we call it a brigade? The brigade has got five battalions. -Yeah. Your son is in the third battalion. If I were to enroll as a partisan, I would go in the first battalion. For the moment being, I'm not going. -Why? Firstly, I have to settle some things with scumbags like Bamke Qylollari and Sali Protopapa. If you aren't a partisan, you can't settle things with Bamke or Rarhke! I can settle them very well, Hajr. My son with his brigade over there, and you and me over here. we are going to settle things with all scumbags! You have'to excuse us We are in a hurry, because we have things' to do You can go in a hurry, > but don't tired yourselves too mush. We don't harvest to get tired. I know that you harvest with your riffle'! Goodbye. -Death to the fascism, Teacher. Death to the fascism! -Freedom to the people! Guri! Guri! Ibrahim? Teacher? Come inside, guys. There is no need to call me out. You can come inside and consider it your home. The dog saw you and didn't bark. If Sali Protopapa came here, then he would act differently. Stop! In this way, we are going to travel twice as fast. The village is not very far from the mill. You should arrange it well in the cart, because it may fall down. No, we shouldn't lie it down. 1 If you want, I can get on the cart to hold it. Okay, that comrade and the little boy can get on, and the others can walk. Are your ready, fellows? .Shall, we go now? -Let's go! They look alike. -Brothers always do look alike. Easy, easy. You shouldn't harm your wounds. Goddamn these rocks! We are going to relax a little as soon as we get to the mill. Hang on! Hang on! It wasn't wise to go to the village. It's not like we wanted to get surrounded. I had to gather the Lajthiza unit in a meeting. We can tell to the teacher to attend that meeting. Surely, he has gone to the mill. Don't think about that right now. Ibrahim? -He is seriously wounded. .The teacher isn't here? -No. Quick, let's get into the mill! They are freezing from the wind. Helga? What has happened to you, guys? And, I didn't know anything! I his goddamn mill is making me deaf! Who did you fight against? With Sali Protopapa goons. -Scumbags! I hope th'ey-break their neck somewhere! I thought something had happened when I'heard those shots last night. These are dangerous times, guys. Quick, let's lie him down. What are you standing there for? Quick! Start the fire. This filthy Sali is doing vile acts, but he will get what he deserves. What happened, Braho? You surrendered this quick? Hold me! Yes, I surrendered. -It's better, if you don't talk. When your wounds hurt, the best medicine is silence. Listen to me! Thoma, today, at the meeting in Lajthiza, I was going to read a statement from the Party's district committee. Take it. It's in the left pocket of the jacket. You can find it in the middle of the notebook. There! I am afraid it has been soaked with blood. Tonight, the meeting must be held. Do you understand? \Ne can't wait any longer. He has to be sent to the doctor. The partisan hospital is far from here. The city is near. -To Dr. Borova? Yes, I think to send him there. -Do you think the doctor will,accept? He is afraid of politics, but he is an honest man. We used to be friends. I used to teach his children. Go to doctor Kristo Borova. -I know. I will go! No, you will come with me in Lajthiza. We will take him there with a cart. -Where can we.find a cart? Mazllum Bylyku is going to be here any moment now. He has been milling all week the wheat he took from the villagers for salt. We are going to send him off with Demka and Guri. Mazllum Bykyku? I What are you talking about? He is a coward. -If he chickens out, we have this... You're right! -We will have problems at the police roadblock. What problems, son? We have' passed riffles in the roadblocks, not to mention people! Go tell my wife to get dressed. No, we shouldn't go through the roadblock, but through the hills. Rustem and I will accompany you to the gates of Korea. Whatever happens, we will be together. -I agree. Mazllum! Are you up, miller? -I'm up. I'm up! I have come with wheat and to bring you good 'fortune. Stones are here to grind. Where there is wheat, there is fortune! Your head only thinks about wheat, Mazllum! If I were to grind your head, I'm sure there will be corn inside! People are getting killed, while you do nothing, Mazllum! No, miller. -Yes'. I have heard the 'Germans are collecting all the wheat. The Germans h'ave wheat enough for my dogs and for your donkey! That's what yot think! Where are your wife and your son going miller? To the city. Mazllum? Listen, you are going to take the cart and come to Korea with us. If somebody asks on the way there, you will tell them that we.are transporting a wounded from blood feud. Do you understand? -What did you say? In Corca? Yes, you greedy bastard! In Korcd! You can take a sack of wheat, too. You oan sell it and make some money. Please, don't put my little ones in danger! Don't make my life hard. There is turmoil in Korea. Do you understand that we are talking about a man's life here, Mazllum? Why do you involve me, Mr. Teacher? There are others. -Come on! Move! Get in, wife. Go to the front of the cart. We don't have anymore time. I'm going to be your responsability. -Hold up Ibrahim's head'. That's it. Don't stop! Just walk as before. If you talk, I am going to fill you up;with bullets. Stay calm, Rustem. The Germans guide is Letter Lefteri, the worst snitch in Corca. -He shouldn't see Ibrahim. They know each-other. -I know. If they get near, we have to fire. -We are outnumbered. There is no other way out. What's up, Mazllum? -Nothing is going on They left. Don't be afraid, you greedy bastard. Come on! Let's take the cart on the road. If you are God b‘elieversT let me get back! You can take the oxes and the cart! -You can't get back now. Where are you going to go? -I will get back! Let him go. -I am certain that he will report us. He is afraid from his own shadow. -Nevertheless, we shouldn't let him go. We aren't going to force anyone to come on our side. You can go, Mazllum. But, if you report this, you will answer with your life! The oxes and the wheat will be’ at the mill in the evening. Go! Come on! Thoma, you have to get back with Rustem now. -Not yet. No, you should get back. Don't forget about the meeting. Bon't tell the elders about me. ARIF Thank you very much, old man. We need a handbarrow. Otherwise, we can't take it there. I am going to Asllan's mill to ask if they have something. I am going with you, uncle Rustem. -Come on. Interesting! Even though now it is a power station, they still call it Asllan's mill. Mr. Teacher, life is full of surprises. Arif, I thought you were going to say something else. Yes, life is surprising. At first, I was with the group that wanted to kill Ibrahim, comrades. Sit down, Arif.Don't be scared. You are even carrying a riffle! You should be ashamed! Who do you thihk you are talking to? -To you, moron! You should i worry about yourself. -Why don't you worry about yourself? How can'this be? You are a poor peasant, and you are part of the gоons from the National Front! I am a patriot. Uncle Bamka is a patriot, too. Sali Protopapa is a patriot, too! -You are kidding, right?! Then, why didn't they fight against the ihvaders, but they stay hidden like'rats? They are patriots, who like to eat chicken and pilaf! That's your Bamka and Sali Protopapa! I go wherever uncle Bamka is! That's the last of my father, when he died What if uncle Bamka goes into the river? You are going after him? Why do you follow me everywhere? You should worry, about yourself. The Germans gave you this riffle? -Uncle Bamka gave it to me. To shpot against the partisans, against me? Right? What are partisans, you moron? They are poor and needy like you. Arif-,- you will get to your senses one day, afraid you will be ashamed of what you are doing. Now listen, if you are going to carry that thing with the feagle in the head, don't-get anymore in front of the partisans. Stop! Stop there! I will get your brains sprayed on the wall! Go to hell! Who dares to say "stop" in my home? Arif? Why don't you say something, you devil? What are you doing here? Sali Protopapa is in there. -Sali Protopapa? Aunt! -Good God! Why do you come behind me like death? Your uncle is crying with happiness! Sali Protopapa is here. Go to the room, dear nephew. Devil! You scared me. Goddamn you! What is this, aunt? Why are you so scared? Sali Protopapa is inside. They are drinking. Cheers, guys! -Cheers! Cheers! Ватка! Ватка! -Yes, sir. Bring raki, Bamke! Or I am going to do something bad tonight!

Where have you been, rascal?! Enough! Enough! Here, take some appetizers. Take some appetizers, because you can't eat when you sing. Ватка? -Yes? Ватка? -Yes, sir. Listen, if you don't bring here the ram of the herd, will call you a scoundrel! Bring me the ram, because I will slaughter it in the middle of the ode! No! I will slaughter it in the middle of the eating table! I will gladly bring it, Sali Protopapa! Where are you going, Sali's mutt? Uncle can not carry the ram himself. You have quite a nephew, Bamka. Go! Now, sing along with me, guys. Sali Protopapa is the best man in the whole world. You never loose, if you follow him. Here it is! Come on! Ватка? Ватка? -What is it? They have seen Ibrahim tonight. He was talking to people around the village. What are you talking about, cousin? You saw him yourself? With my own eyes Did you have your riffle with you -Yeah. Your hands were tied? -I was scared. Goddamn you! You are not honouring Qylollari's blood! Get out of here! Take this goddamn bell off! Ibrahim is here. Why do we follow Ibrahim, uncle? He is fighting against the Germans. Against the Germans? He has told people to fight against Sali Protopapa. We have to catch him, and hang by his tongue up the oak tree. Listen to Bamka! Well, why don't we fight the Germans? Against the Germans? Why? What have the Germans done to us? You should leave people alone, if you want to be left alone. Partisans are giving us a lot of trouble. Listen to Bamka! Give it to me. Put the ram on my shoulders. You will tire yourself, uncle. -Give it to me. I want Sali Protopapa to see me. I hope you never get old, Bamke Qylollari! I am glad to serve you, Salil In the name of God, if I don't slaughter it in the middle of the eating table, you mustn't call me Sali Protopapa anymore. Give it to me! Where are you? You will defecate! Of course you will! Hang on, I will tell about defecation! Spray the walls red, now. Take him tb the eating table to die out. The meat should be roasted in the skewer. The insides should be triped. I hope you never get old, Bamke Qylollari. You scoundrels! What is going on? What is it? Why don't you talk? You sons of bitches! You feel sorry for the ram? Do you want me to pay for it? How much is it? Неге! Is it enough? Sali, I can bring you the whole heard. I swear with my life. I will let my home become a slaughterhouse. But, I just heard something. -Talk to me! Tonight, at dawn, that rascal was seen in the middle of the village. Who, Ваmкa? -That Ibrahim Kovaci. Did you say Ibrahim Kovaci? -Yes. Rascals! You are eating grass here! How is it possible that you let him pass under your nose? Quick, find him and bring him here, because I will slaughter him myself, like a slaughtered the ram! Move! Wait! If you don't find him and bring him here, I will masacre the whole village! Tell this to everybody! Get out of my sight! Quick! Faik! -Yes, sir! -Come here! Listen, hurry and go to Hans Bingkop. Tell him to come here as soon as he can, or else, Sail Protopapa will be in real trouble! Get going! They are here at Guri Cobani's house. We will get them like a sheep that goes in the mouth of the wolf! Sali Protopapa will be very happy. What are you doing, scoundrel? He heard the shot, and now we can't catch anybody, you moron! You will never get him, uncle! Pigs! Rascals!- You don't want to give up that communist pig? ।You should know that it will be too late. You wjll regret it. Rascals, I am trying to protect you from the war. And, you 'get together with the red communists.! You filthy bastards! Sali, I hope you live a long life and be with us forever, because you give us peace, and you protect our houses from fire. You even grow the number of our oattle! Even the kids laugh and play, when you come here. But. the things you say.,about the village are not true at all. We haven't seen dr. heard any red or communist; as you call him. You should check and see if they lied at you, Mr. Sali. Maybe you are bothering the village that loves and honours you for nothing. Cut the crap, you old.geezer! Ibrahim has spent the last night here in the village. Don't try to fool us! If you don't bring him out, you aren't going to enjoy the wheat oveir there! Now, he will make the villagers talk’. Go to your place. We will wait for 1 minute We will wait for 1 minute... ...and if you don't bring out that partisan. I mean, the communist scoundrel Ibrahim, I will shoot... I mean, the Germans, and me too will shoot 10 men from the village! I mean, did you understand me?-! You scumbags! Are you going to talk? Come on, Salo! Come on, Red! Come on, Salo! Come on, Red! Who are you talking about?! -The horses, Mr. Bamka. Sulo is that white, one. He. is wild. -Leave, the horses! Father told me to finiSh the wheat, because it is going to rain. will show you how to grind the wheat! You should be ashamed, rascal! You fight with kids! Tie a cloth around their eyes! I don't want to have my eyes closed, because I want to see Sali Protopapa. Protect us from' the Germans, Sali Protopapa. Protect our lives, like you protect our homes, like you protect our children, and our wheat, Sali Protopapa! Tell us the hideout of Ibrahim Kovaci and they will let you go. Well, I want a souvenir from you when I go on the other side, Sali. Can you kiss my ass? Who do you think you are talking to? THE SCULPTOR Let me carry it for a while, Mr. Teacher. You have been carrying for quite some time now. It's okay. It's okay. -Let's switch places. The winter has begun since September. This time last year, we hadn't started the fire yet. You should kill that goddamn bird, Kristo! Hit the glass a little to scare it. It will go away. The others always sigh in silence. Even though you don't sigh, you are laughing. Leave me alone! Generally, this sighing orders are the biggest stupidities. Thank God you are a critic now! What about your drawings? What are they? -Here! Have a look at them. These are stupid, too. It's better to read books. -Books? am fed up with all the books at the library. There is nothing about our life. Only fiction! Then, what should we read? I don't know. I see they are bad, but I don't know'how they-should be. This is a spiritual crisis, sister! Crisis! Bullshit! What you are saying and what she is reading are both bullshit. You mustn't abandon sciences. Someday, the college will reopen, and you should finish school. Wait! I will get it. Who is it? -Open up! We are friends. Is the doctor home? -Yes. Open up! Who is it? -It's a patient. Why didn't they take him to the hospital? Doctor? -Yes? Take this. Yeah. Right. Take him inside. He is covered in blood. This way. He is seriously wounded, doctor. -Let me see. Yes. I see. Doctor, you must take care of the boy now. Please! Okay, okay. Don't worry. -Where is the other wound? Here, in the leg, doctor. Alright. You should go now, and I leave him with me. How are we going to learn about his health? He isn't in any kind of risk. You should go, now. Okay, then. Good night. -Wait a minute. Andon, go and have a look outside in the road, in case there is someone. We will come to talk with you at the hospital. What is happenning to us?! What is happening to us?! I am so afraid they .will come and raid the house. Poor father! am glad your fiance not here. -Why? He is an advocate of the' Germans. He always likes to talk about Germans. "German's will! German's troops!" We are nothing according to him! Take this, Kristina. Maybe, I get excited, but these people astonish me. Where do they get all this power? They get hurt', wounded. They fight with death constantly. We will be on guard tonight. In the yard? -No, in the road with the riffle! We will stay by his side. -We can stay, too, father. No! Maybe, I am being a conservative and fanatic father, but, I don't you to enter inside the room of the patient. I am going to sleep for two hours. When he wakes up, give him a lemon tea. -I'll do it. I wonder why we didn't hear any moaning. I thought... -Are you in' any Your father has a soft hand. You know, you look very familiar faces. We have met in the college. You have been in the upper classes. You have a scratch in the forehead. It is a token from the November demonstration. Since then, I have abandoned books and the college. What book is that? -"The sighs bridge." Do you want it? Now, it's not.the time to think about-such books.- They say that communists despise beautify! things. Rubbish! I like beautiful things. What are you doing here? Did you forget what your father said? You should be ashamed! You are bothering the patient. I get bored when I am alone, lady. -Good night. Good night. -Good night. Come here more often. You have to drink this. We are late. Our aunt will be furious. Tell her I am not feeling well. I'm not coming today. Sleep,, honey! -Take the book and read it! Thank you. How are you feeling? -A little bit better. I am glad you Game. Please, take this letter to one of my friends. -Where does he live? His shop is at the craftsmen street. You should ask for Xhemal Porodina. What should I tell him? -Nothing. I Dr. Borova's son! Your father doesn't need any plugs or axes. I can't make any needles. I have a letter for you. -A letter-for me? From who? What? Wait. I am going to get dressed. Do you want to be a blacksmith? . -It's nice. You can come someday, doctor's son, but you should be careful not to make your hands dirty. Read the newspaper "Bashkimi Kombit!" "Bastwmi i kombit!" The Prime Minister urges for unification and brotherhood. "Bashkimi i Kombit!" Bashkimi i Kombit!" The newspaper "Bashkimi i Kombit!" A newspaper! -Yes, sir! "Bashkimi i Kombit!" Newspaper "Bashkimi i Kombit!" The Prime Minister urges for unification and brotherhood. What's uр doctor's son? Are you reading about the heroic standing of the German troops in the Dniepr shores?' -Dniepr is in Ukraine That's what it says there, Dniepr, not Volga. Where were you? -I had a hard time getting permission from Miss Lulushe. Hello! -Hello! How are you doing, madam? -I am fine. Where is the patient? -The patient? We don't have any patient here. They are Ibrahim's friends, mom. Come in. How are you? -Very well. How are you doing? Someday, you will bring here the entire city! You will get it from your father! You -were' wounded and we didn't' know anything- The comradfes didn't have the opportunity to inform you. There, was no time. -I hadn't thought I would see you like this. I knew I would get caught by a bullet. It's a given. As they say, you are always going to dance in a wedding! Where did you get wounded? -Sali Pretdpapa's goons did this to me. They say this Sali Protopapa will be appointed as gendarmerie Commandant here. -Really? wel, well! What, is'going on in the city? You*can stay, Andorj. Things are what they аrе. There is a lot of to be done in the city. We are gathering some guns te send in the mountain. Doctor Shahini is'asking for medicine for the partisan hospital.. We are also working with that depot. A telegram. Spiro says he will come back next week, on friday. Spiro Qendro! We know. -How do you know that? You will learn it when a bullet flies by his head! We are leaving now. You will stay here, until Spiro arrives. Nobody will think that you are staying in this house. You have to get better. We will inform the comrades about everything. Death to fascism! -Death to fascism! Freedom to the people! Go on. Show them out. through the back-door. Has anyone come today for Ibrahim? -Yes. What is that? What have you heard? -Nothing. They are looking for him. The walls are full of posters. They are shooting anybody who knows where he is and doesn't tell. You will get us in trouble. Tell them to come and get him in another house. We have kids, Kristo. -Okay, okay. How is he? Has he eaten? -Only breakfast. You fool! You should have, given him .two or three times to' eat! How is he going to recover? -He didn't want to eat anymore. You should have forced'hlm! I have a few words with him. What are you, a man or a child? What will you replenish the blood you have lost with? You have to eat, not smoke! -I am bored, doctor. You arejaored? You have to be grateful ithat you didn't die! The thTermemeterj. What is going on in the hospital, doctor?' Are there any, wounded Germans-^ «-They have their own hospital. There are some wounded Germans even in our hespital. When they come to your hospital, this means theirs is full. According to simple logic... Goddamn it! We need doctors in the mountain'. There are only a few. Even the doctors -we have;,-don't have any equipments. Do you know doctor Shahini? -Yes. We have studied together in Austria. Move your fingers. At the partisan hospital in Gurkosan, he amputated my friend's leg with a saw, and without narcosis. When doctor Shahini decided to become a partisan, he left the keys of his clinic to my father. Then, some villagers came to get the equipments. My father helped them.> -These are difficult times. Your job is getting more difficult. doctor. It has always been hard. -Now, it's mere difficult than ever. For example, you operate and treat me at your home, while in the hospital. you operate and treat the germans. They are our enemies, doctor. And; you repair them like old military vehicles, and they fight against us. Maybe I am wrong, but you simplify things a little. And, I can understand you very well. Someene who decides to do a speeific job. he is forced to get to the end of it. But every ease and circumstanse' has a positive and a negative side. Where is the good or the bad in staying ,out of the national War? Yeili think I am staying in the sidelines? Very well. Doesn't this person that stays in the sidelines help the war by treating illegals? This its positive side. The bad thing is that under this circumstances, I have to treat Germans, too. Doctor, you are treating me as a friend of your friend, You are serving our war without your complete knowledge,.. While to the Germans... -Being fully aware about it? I don't say that, but even you treat them out of fear, you still have a responsability. -My responsability? You judge people based on your standards, young man. Doctor, when cam I get up? I think in about a week time-, you can use the clutches. Why? Your son in law will come nехt week. -Yes. And? He can't find out about me. -What's, with you and my son in law? The teacher said the same thing in his letter. Well, Spire is a friend of the.Germans and their spies. It isn't true. It's no posssible. He has got to stay in touch With them only because his job, trade. What is his relation to Letter Lefteri? They are friends. They have studied tegether in Germany E)p you know that your son in law friend has spied on Kico Greco, Mili Kostani, who burned the fascist offices? My son in law is Spiro Qendro, not Letter Lefteri. Tell who you 'stay With, and.I will tell you who you are Young man, you came here to get treated. or to disrupt my family? -Doctor, this is the truth. If you like, you can consider this as disruption. But, I would feel ssrry, if someday your daughter would beceome the widow of a traitor. Ibrahim! Why are you standing here?/. It Wasn't nice to get him angry like that. You told him the truth. Sit down. Andon. > Sit down. These are year drawings? -Yes. My father likes my drawings, eyen though these are meaningless. You would like to become a painter? I practise drawing, but my dream is te become a sculptore. Thats a good thing. But. now it's the time to choose something greater, Andon, the wау to become a man. -A man? Where will this man put his enengi^s, on our side or on the ether side?? This way, we won't get red with blood later! I don't know, but I saw another world at the blacksmith's today. Between the fire and the red sparkles ®f the iron Xhemal looked like a rebel that was making his own sword. Can I make’a sculpture like that?, -You have to draw it first, Ahdon. Draw it', and we will hand it out with our pamphlets. TlYe'-whole nation should see your rebel. I drew him many times, but I wasn't satisfied. I drew him again and again... I didn't understand why the rebel's face looked like that of Ibrahim's. I think his face was deeply embedded in my memory. That's why I had to build this bust. When l finished it, I felt relieved of a huge burden. I don't know. Does Rustem like the bust of his brother? I You have to forgive us. because we are not from around here. Whose is this bust? Ibrahim Kovaci's. Comrades, the district committee has sent Thoma to organize the retrieval of the weapons. What have you done about that, Xhemal? Now, things are what they are. All the coachmen are prepared to work for us two or three days. Not only for us, but even for themselves. because we are fighting for everyone, right? Just tell us where to unload them. The district headquarter thinks that the most suitable place is the ridge accross Drenica. This way, the carts will not get noticed, because they will do the usual itinerary to transport sand from the river. We have arranged the further transportation of the weapons with the villagers. We can take them to the ridge within a day. Right, Xhemal? That's right. Also, I have made a deal with Arif, Sali Protopapa's gendarme. He promised to send us a lorry. What if this Arif sets us up -I know him very well. He thinks he did wrong by joining Sali Protopapa's crew. Irbrahim too thinks that they lied to Arif. Goddamn it! He was lied to, that one was lied to... Who is doing the masacres, then? We should fight only against Hitler, because the others are lied to! Don't get angry, Xhemal. Arif has done other things for us. When we talked about the lorry, he said that he wanted to escape from Sali Protopapa. You should have said this since the beginning. You made Xhemal angry for nothing. Be careful, comrades. The patrol. Quiet! Let's continue, comrades. Comrade Thoma, Arif shouldn't get away from Sali Protopapa. Can he help us in his actual post? -I believe that he can. Let's put him to a test. -Okay. Let's put him to a test. This is the best opportunity. Comrades, the headquarter wants the snitch Letter Lefteri to be excecuted as soon as possible, because he is in the trail of Ibrahim. We have to get Ibrahim in another safe house. He can't walk yet. -Yes. The assassination will be carried out tomorrow, according to the plan of our unit. Let me do it, comrades. Our village has a lot to settle with Letter Lefteri. He was directly involved in the massacre of 13 September. Thoma is right. This way, we will put Arif to the test, too. Thoma, you will ask him to get a gendarme uniform. Tomorrow, at 17:00, when Letter Lefteri will get out of the German headquarter, you two... Almonds! Неге! -Apples! Apples! That fox! • He went the other way. He went into the cafe. -I think he recognised me. I will get him out of there. God, save the alcoholic Petro^ from fighting the scumbags -that seme in and out from the Bato's cafe! Don't get up, Andon. No, my father sent me here to get a bottle of wine, but Fred kept me this long. -The doctor has a guest? You don't get wine just for the guests. A double "Croumel." -Yes, sir. Attention! Attention! We are repeating the order from the German headquarter. It is forbidden to walk in groups of three. It is forbidden to walk with your hands in the pookets. After 18:00, it is forbidden to get around the city. Attention! Attention We are repeating the order from the German headquarter. It is forbidden to walk in groups of three. Letter Lefteri, somebody is asking for you. It is forbidden to walk with your hands in the pockets. After 18:00, it is forbidden to get around the city. Letter Lefteri, in the name of the people, you are sentenced to death. Get out of my way! -Get out of my way! Xhemal! Mr. Teacher! Come with me! How are you doing, Braho? We came to visit you. You should forgive us for not buying you anything. They usually bring рапесГкеэ to the patient. How are you Xhemal? You look tired -Yes, tired! Anyway, Letter Leftem sends you his' respects! Thank God Andon was there, because the patrol blocked the road to. go to our safe house. You mean, the bullet went near Andon's ear today? You will see .how beautiful he will'make our tracts. He is very talented... Okay, but what about his trigger finger? One step at a time Xhemal. What is going on the mountain? You have to get better, Braho; Get better. We are waiting, for you to get back as soon as possible. Rustem sends you his regards. Asllan, the miller, Guri; and Ветка. Not to mention your parents. They miss you a lot. They wanted to come and see you, but we hesitate to let them come. Did you hear anything? What are they saying? ...that harbours communists, assassinators, 'terrorists, or suspicious people, is sentenced to death. ALMA. Mother, I am thirsty,. -Teacher, bring me the water. Alma, teach him to go to the fountain, because it is tastier. Like this. That's it, son. Did you get hurt? -If you fall, you are bound to get hurt. It is early to get up, Ibrahim. I can't stay here and do nothing, Alma. There is war everywhere. We will part ways after some days. / Who knows? Maybe a bullet will hit me againg someday, and we will gel doctor Borova in trouble again1. They say the bullet gets-you once. I have a 'friend that has caught seven bullets. Is he still alive? -Like a bear! Also, a girl im our battalion has been wounded three times. Are there a let ef partisan girls? -There are ,a lot. Tihiere are several fro'nn the Qslleg'e'.too. And, I stay here and eat the lunches prepared by NfiTss Kristina! ®®n't talk like that, Ibrahim. Everybody loves you here. Nevertheless, I will leave. I know why you are in such a hurry to leave. You are leaving, because he will get back. He is not only my enemy, but yours, too. Everybody's. Alma? Alma, I want to talk to you about something. Talk with me? -Yes, to talk with you. You heard what Xhemal said about the medicine doctor Shahini needs. Dr. Shahini? Is it the one who operates with a saw? » Yes, he is the one. Here, Alma. I have prepared a list for medidine and you can help us. Me? What can I do? I have a friend, whose father is farmacist, but... We have to think, Alma. You are a clever girl. Alma, what are you doing here? He can't stand up on his own, mother. He falls down. Leave it over there,, rnadam. Hello! -Hellо! What is this? Ibrahim is practising with the clutches? Yes, he is drilling all our heads in with these clutches! Yeah, right! He has a lot of willpower. Spiro is staying too long in Tirana. Kris,, when our son in law comes here, you talk too much. I am saying it again, he can't learn anything about Ibrahim. Do'you understand? -It's better if he doesn't come. You have never liked him. You shouldn't act like this. He is youn brother in law. He isn't a brother in law yet, mothen -What do you mean? Who can it be this late? Tell Ibrahim to be careful. Who is it? -Open the door, madam. Madam, we are Ibrahim's parents. We wanted to see him. Come in. Come in. Come on. Where is Braho staying? My dear son! My dear son! -Son! Here, doctor's lady. I lost it. -What's this? It's too much. This is all we have. -Don't get offended, doctor. Let’s go inside. We are tiring the boy. My son! Here. Careful. Didn't I tell you that Ibrahim is feeling better now? Why, the don't say good things about doctor Kristo for nothing! I feel better, father. I feel better. -My poor son! You must have suffered a lot. -We can't repay you, doctor. I hope your children have a long and prosperous life. Thank you. How are things in the village? And the teacher? Very well. He isn't staying in the village anymore. He went in the mountain with the partisans. Listen, the teacher is good for this, and for this, too. I have brought you some books and notebooks, because you need them. When those Sali Protopapals goons came to raid the house, ’ they threw them in the yard. Some of them were torn apart, some were wrinkled, but a picked them up..one by one. I saw these books and notebooks in the yard, and I felt sorry, like they were alive! -Give them to me, father. We suffered quite a lot the night they ambushed our.son. There were shootings everywhere. I stayed under the window with my husband. I said: "Husband, I am afraid our son will get hit by a bullet." He told me: "Shut up! No bullets can touch our son." Sali Protopapa joined forces with the Germans, but they couldn't do anything to my son.,They didn't get him. Sail Protopapa! I am sure they will find him with a bullet in his head on the road. He is next on the list. And, if the party puts you on the list, you are dead! You can come in and have some dinner. What are you talking about, madam? -Well, it is late. You have nowhere to go. -Ibrahim hasn't eaten, too. Yes, Ibrahim too. Wonderful. We haven't eaten together in a-long time. Come in; -It's been a long time. Very goodifolks. We will drink a few glasses tonight. Or, you communists are against raki? -No, we drink to feast with friends. No, I was just wondering. Let him drink tonight. What should we toast about? -Freedom. When will we have freedom? -To freedom. The lights went out again? There is a big fire. Based on the explosions, I think it's the weapon's depot. Well done, Xhemal! Welcome! -Thanks you. Thank- you welcoming us. This city is always oh-the move. :Yes, on the move. Wherever you go, there is war going on. These are hard times. Doctor, they say that next summer, the Germans will get out of here'. We will be freed. I hope it's true. I hope it is true. The Germans are weakened by the partisans. I am telling you, they will break their head. Poor Albania, has seen 'quite a lot. -That's right, father. What is it, Alma? You didn't even eat lunch. I am not feeling well, mother. -Are you sick? Yes, I have a headache-I'm going to sleep. W.hat is it, daughter? -Don't worry, mother. It's nothing. Good night, father. Good night. -Good night. ls'your daughter engaged, madam? -Yes, she is engaged. Congratulations! -Thank you. Apples! Peaches! Plums! Apples! Peaches! Iliums! Where have you been, child? Why didn't you tell us anything? We have been waiting you all day long. Spiro is here. -Spiro? In the telegram, he said he was ‘corning on Friday. Today is Thursday. . I don't know. He came with his car. Welcome! -Thank you. You have changed your hairstyle. This is a surprise for me. Your arrival was a surprise for me, too. Today isn't Friday. I departed suddenly. I caught Sali Protopapa with his car. You know that transportation is very difficult. You came in the same car with that animal? He isn't a bad man, father. He isn't school educated, but he is entertaining. He has something primitive, that reminds you of real men. Real men don't lick German boots! To honour the guest in your house, doesn't mean to lick his boots. You can not call the invader a guest! The Germans are not invaders. They will go away as soon as the war is over. Maybe I am wrong, but any army that comes from orpe country and steps on another country is called an invader. It is'different with the Germans. They bring progress. Germanу?, is cleaning the old Europe from the Sоviet Bоlshevism. After this cleaning,- the German armies will get back to their country. What about when they burn villages, slaughter children with bayonets? Are they still bringing progress? Wherever they go, they bring the plague. You are a communist, dear father in law, and I didn't know it. I am not a communist, but I want my country to be free. However, even you treat a wounded German once a while. Cheers! -I treat them, because I am forced to. You can't say bad things about them, when you do that much for them. Dear father in law, with these words you are ruining your reputation, because I think that even the communists don't like you that much. How can they like me, when I repair the wounded Germans and get them back in the battle against the partisans? You have close interests with the Germans, like mine. You take patients from the Germans, and I take ithe goods. So, we both Have benefits. I told you, I treat Germans, because I am forced to, not to earn money. -That's worse, dear father in law. I work with Germans only to trade with them. Believe me, I wouldn't give even a glass of water to a wounded German. So, you are a patriot now? -Like Sali Protopapa. Alma, you shouldn't get involved in men's talk. Stay for lunch, Spiro. Everything is ready. No, Miss Kristina. I am leaving, because I haven't been to my home yet. Alma, I'll come and get you in the evening to go out. Have a nice day! -Have a nice day! Father, we can't tolerate this! He made you a collaborator of the Germans, like himself! Sit over there, Andon. Kristina, sit down. I may sound too harsh, but I don't want Spiro in this house. We will be ashamed, Kristo! I don't want to have a scumbag as a son in law! We are very sorry, Alma. We are sorry to have you engaged with a man like that. It's better this happened now, then later on. Father, I was going to say it myself. 'He will bring trouble, if Alma leaves him. Let him do whatever he will. Pleased At least, let this go on, until Ibrahim gets better. No, we aren't hypocrites. We will call the engagement off tonight! Why didn't we know him sooner? -I couldn't see because of work! I didn't see anything else beside my work! I was a miop! I was a moron! Don't yell! The whole neighbourhood will hear us. Let them hear! What are you doing? It's time to say goodbye, doctor. I am sorry if I Have brought troubles in your family, but it's better to get used to troubles, then to sleep tight. Right, Alma? We should wait a little, Ibrahim. They should be here any moment now. No, no. Who knows what Spiro will do? Andon, go and inform Xhemal about what happened. I will go by myself in the other safe house. Maybe, we will meet on the way. Ibrahim, your wounds aren't'healed yet. You will fall on the street. -Goodbye, d'octor. I will accompany him, father. It is dark and cold outside. What are you talking about, daughter? -Let her go. Go, Alma. Go! Goodbye. Thank you for everything; What are our children doing, Kristo? Where are they going in the middle of the night? They are adults now, Kris. Nice! It's been a while since the wind hit on my face. Look, Ibrahim "The Albanian Communist Party calls on the honest people to get their riffles and to join the national army for freedom." The Albanian Communist Party calls on the honest people to get their riffles and to join the national army for freedom. The Albanian Communist Party calls on the honest people to get their riffles and to join the national army for freedom... Mom; did the Germans fear this guy? -Yes, son. They were afraid. ALL OF THEM Let's rest a little while here in the middle of the field. Yes, the wheat has a nice smell. Genci? This field wasn't harvested yet at that time. It was waiting the sicle. This is a new wheat and can't tell anything a'beut that time. This field has, been cultivated many time's since then. Yes, it was the June operation. There are too many. If there are too many, we should decimate them. Take а lооk! We Have the Sali Protopapa's goons here, too. Goddamn them with their white fezzes! They are a-'disgrace to our race! Ibrahim! Commarjider! The Germans are gpihg up the stream. Sali Protopapa 'knows the terrain very well and he is bringing them on our back. '	I swear! We can't let them take our flanks. Arif, Rustem, come with me Quick! Ibrahim? will come with you, too. No. no. Andon. This is a good'.place for sculptors. Ibrahim? Be careful! They say the bullet gets you only once, Alma. Andon, get back! -I will come with you There is discipline in the partisan-army. This is an order!' I hope Sali Pnotopapa comes here.. I will get him s&me.noles ip the belly! Don't take it easily, Ari’f, Sali Protopapa is truly a scumbag, but,a coward!. Come on! He is an asshole. You know him better, Aliifs because he was your commander. Don't remind дре. Whenever I think about him, my beard shivers! Goddamn it! I have to shave my b’eard. Open fire! What are you waiting for? Wait! Let them come nearer. Shoot, Rustem! Shoot' Rustem! There he is! .Don't hide your head behind the rock', Sali Protopapa! It is me, Arif,-*who is talking to you, the one who you lied to constantly. Now, it's time to tell the truth to each-other,.. How can you, ragman, curse Sali Protepapa and call him to a duel? Where are you hiding, you little shit? Here I am, you bloodsucker! I tried to teach you how to aim, but you can not teach a child to shoot' like a man! Did you see? /Did you see how you shoot, you filthy bastard? Scumbag! You kepVon cursing until death took you away. You asshole!' You should be more ealm,, Arif. More c'alm. He cursed' me. Damn asshole! Be careful with the bullets. Don't shoot in the air. Rustem, stay here! Don't move. Ibrahim! Ibrahim! My dear son! Dear son! Dear son, I miss you a lot! Enough. Enough, father. It would be better if we would take him home tonight. It's not possible, mother. He isn't' only yours. He belongs,to everybody. -Okay. Let him stay here. THE END
