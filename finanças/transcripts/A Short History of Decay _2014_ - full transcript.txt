I keep wanting to go to Indian restaurants? Yeah, it's turmeric. It's t-turmeric? Well, anyways, well, it says here they've done these clinical studies, and no evidence links any herbal or nutritional supplements to the slightest decrease in risk of developing Alzheimer's. What are you doing? Just research. No. I mean, what are you doing? You're young and healthy, and instead of living your life, you're worrying about some disease you might get when you're 80. Well, if I can prevent it now, why wouldn't I? I'm late for work. Are you gonna be here when I get back? Yeah, I should be, although I might go see a movie at the Angelika. I don't know what's playing, though. I gotta check that. I want to talk. We have to talk. Look, if this is what I think it is, I just... I don't want to have this conversation again, all right? I'm almost done with the play. You just said you're gonna go to the movies today. Yeah, when I take a break. Hmm. When I met you, you were working on a novel and before that, a screenplay. Yeah, okay. Thank you for the encouragement. Don't go there. It's been five years, and I have been very patient and very supportive. Okay, all right. I'm sorry. You're right. Thank you, and I appreciate it. You know, I took your advice. I rewrote the part of Gustavo to be more sympathetic, but also ruthless. It's got nothing to do with Gustavo! I've met someone. Shit. What do you mean, you've met someone? At the "Paris Review" party. His name is David, and he's a literary agent. You already have a literary agent. I'm not looking for representation, Nathan. I'm looking for a relationship. We don't have a relationship? We've been living together for four years. We fuck sometimes. We drink a lot. You watch television. You pretend to be writing something when really you're just staring at that screen, looking up random shit, like how Indian spices can preserve your brain. So, because I'm concerned about my health, you think it's okay to have an affair? We're not married, so it doesn't qualify as an affair. You're already fucking him? No, not yet. Oh, great, but you're gonna fuck him. You're just announcing that you're gonna cheat on me. Well, if I tell you I'm gonna do it, then it's not cheating. How is that? Because by telling you I'm gonna do it, I'm de facto breaking up with you. Therefore, I'm free to do whatever I want. I keep forgetting you went to law school. I'll talk to you later. Come on. E-Erika? How do you see this going, to be exact? I'll be sitting at the apartment, watching TV, waiting for you to come home. "Hi, honey. How was your date?" Or do I just stay up all night wondering if you're ever gonna come home? Nathan, I'm at work now. Goodbye. Guess I'll just move out, then? Do you have a place to go? Oh, my God. I didn't know you hated me so much. Nathan, I don't hate you. Just hold on a sec, okay? One sec. One sec. Nathan, I don't hate you, okay? Let's not turn this into something it's not. I'm sure you can stay at Barry's for a while. I gotta go. Barry's? What? Hello? Thanks. You're welcome. Hi. See you later. What? Hey. Oh, shit. Just need to talk to you for a second. Please, not here. Not now. My dad had a stroke. Jack just called. He's with him in Florida. Don't. Please don't do this. You don't know how long, how long I've been working up to this, trying to find the nerve to end this. This isn't about you. Just let me finish. I love your parents, but I've crossed a line. Don't suck me back in. I may never find the energy to do this again. I'm not trying to suck you back in to anything. I'm on my way to Florida. There's a taxi waiting for me outside. I just wanted to tell you. I just wanted to see you. I wanted to see you before I left. God, I'm sorry. - How is he? - I don't know. It's hard to say. Jack says he's stable. Is your mom okay? No. She's really confused. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. I'm so sorry you have to go through this. I'm so sorry you have to go through all of this. Jack's got to get back to D.C., so I'm gonna head down to Florida for... Can you just not... Can you just not start seeing someone until I get back? Nathan, what possible difference will that make? Because I just have to get through this, and I can't be taking care of my parents while... imagining you in bed with somebody else. Can you just wait for things to get better? I can't handle all this right now. I just need a little help. Please. Nathan, your dad had a stroke. Your mom's got Alzheimer's. It doesn't get any better. Can you understand that? Yeah, of course. I understand. It doesn't get better. Yeah. Hi. This is Erika. You've reached my cellphone. I've probably misplaced it, and I'm running around, trying to find it, so just leave a message, and I'll get back to you when I can He has a stroke, and you just let him go? I advised him against leaving, but I also told him that there's nothing else we can really do. What do you mean, there's nothing you can do? He's already taking Coumadin. He just needs rest. So there's no reason for him to be here, then? Honestly, he was so worried about leaving your mother alone that it was just causing unnecessary stress, which is the worst thing for him. Hi. - Oh, my God. - Hey, Mom. What are you doing here? How are you? - Hi, sweetheart. - Hey. Look at you. Good to see you. - Come on in. - Can I come in? - Okay. - Sure. You just got here? Yep, just got off the plane. You by yourself? Yeah, just me. Well, how did you get here? I took a flight. We talked this morning, remember? How long's Dad been sleeping? Since we got home. And when was that? Yesterday. Doctor said it was today. I meant what time? Ah, few hours ago. Don't you think you should check on him? No. I don't want to wake him. I forget. Have you been here before? Yeah, about half a dozen times. Erika and I stayed at the Sea Breeze. Ah, how is Erika? She's fine. But you didn't stay here. No. Jack stays here with Kathy and the kids. Jack was just here. Yeah, I know, Mom. I talked to him this morning, and then I talked to you. He's gained a lot of weight. I'm worried about him. Can I fix you something to eat? Hi. This is Erika. You've reached my cellphone. I've probably misplaced it, and I'm running around, trying to find it. Hi, darling. Guess who's here. Nathan. Nathan? Yeah. Hey, Dad. Hey, kiddo. Huh. You look... look pretty good. Feel like shit. - Yeah? - Heh. Whoa. Gotta sit down. O-Okay, yeah. - Sandy. - Huh? How 'bout a cup of coffee? Sure, darling. You want one, too, honey? No. I'm still working on mine, thanks. You got it? - Ah, fuck! - Here you go. How was the trip? Oh, it was good, yeah, easy. Caught a direct flight. Oh, you didn't go through Tampa? No, no, JetBlue goes direct now. You rent a car? No. Well, use mine. Okay. So, I stopped by the hospital earlier. Little surprised that you just checked yourself out. Nothing they're gonna do for me there. It was fucking depressing, bunch of old fucking people. They could have observed you. You should have stayed. Only reason I would have stayed was this Irish nurse. Ah, she was something. Yeah, dream on, hotshot. Now I'm stuck here with this batty old broad. Your father's still a son of a bitch. Well, what do you expect? You could be nicer in front of our child. Nicer? I could be dead. That's how I'd be nicer. I'm freezing in here. I'm gonna turn up the heat. Really? I'm actually kind of hot, Mom. Let her do what she wants. Get me my computer over there, will you? What are you doing? I'm cold. Adjusting the blinds is not gonna make it warmer. It's just gonna make things darker. Just don't argue with her. Okay. I'll... Don't put your coffee cup on the table! Use a coaster! It's fine. It doesn't even leave a spot. Besides, this table's not exactly... What's the matter with the table? There's nothing wrong with the table. It's just not what I would call fine furniture. Yeah. I'm gonna make dinner. You're making dinner now? It's... Don't you think it's a little early? Just use the fucking coaster. Sorry. I'm using the coaster. Using the coaster. Happy? How's Erika? She's good. She called the other day. She was asking about your father. Ah, son of a bitch. That's nice of her. Apple's up again. I shouldn't have listened to your idiot brother. She's very excited about her new book coming out next week. She's gonna send us an autographed copy. How's your book? My book? Yeah, I haven't really had time to work on that, 'cause I've been sidetracked with working on some other... Mom, I don't think you're supposed to microwave plastic. Why not? You give it up? I don't know. Uh, cancer maybe? We don't worry about cancer at our age. Yeah. Well, at my age, th-that's kind of what you do. Honey, we've been microwaving your food since you were a baby. - I microwaved your bottles. - You did what? So what do you do all day, then... You worry too much. - if you don't work on our book? - I... Did I tell you Erika called? Yeah, Mom, you... you mentioned that. What would you like me to say? That a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars? I don't suppose so. Well, it's a toss-up. I can tell you that. What? Hasn't it occurred to you that I'm having a tough time keeping my hands off you? Oh, you should see your face. What's the matter with it? It's lovely. Now what's the trouble? I'm not hungry anymore. Isn't it glorious? - Adam! - It's all right. Come and look. Hi. This is Erika. You've reached my cellphone. I've probably misplaced it, and I'm running around, trying to find it, so just leave a message, and I'll get back to you when I can. Hey. That was so thoughtful of you to call my parents, really. You're probably out right now with that David guy. Fancy dinner, moody East Side Italian place. You looked down at your phone. You saw that it was me, turned it off. "Oh, go on, David, with your story. "It was so interesting. Finish what you were saying." I can't really blame you now. But I do believe it. That's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye... My mom keeps asking about you because she keeps forgetting that she keeps asking about you, and every time she does, it's just like a punch in my stomach. Maybe it's for the best. I don't know. You're probably right, though. I shouldn't worry about Alzheimer's. I'm gonna die of cancer. Yeah, I just found out today not only was I not breast-fed, but that my mom pumped BPA and PCBs into my infant formula. Anyways, call me back. I love you, baby. I love you. I'm sorry. Call me back. Hey, you don't look so bad in this light. Well, why do you think I brought you here? I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out. Pretty good, huh? Hmm. I taught them everything they do. Well, did they do that kind of thing way back in your day? Sure. How do you think I got here? Wow, when you come on, you come on, don't you? Breakfast, honey! I made you eggs! You sure that it's okay to leave you for a half an hour? Yes. How many times do I have to say it? I'm fine. You know, I can just go by myself if you gave me a list. Just go, will you, both of you. I need some goddamn peace. Probably for the best they took your license away. I loved it. Well, you know what? That's not for you to say. I know, but you weren't a great driver to begin with. That's for me to say. I... I was an excellent driver. I haven't got one ticket. - I've been driving since I was 16. - Yeah. You should talk. You... Couple fender benders, though. Well, that was a long time ago. Not your fault, of course, right? Yeah. God, you're going too fast. You're going to get a ticket. I'm not going too fast. There's nobody even here. Darling, there are rules in life. Do you hear that sound? Hmm? What sound? What sound? The... That grinding sound from the hood. I'm sure it's nothing. Oh, Mom, that is definitely something. Don't tell your father. Why not? Because I don't want to upset him. Mom, he's gonna be upset if the engine blows up. It's not gonna blow up. Why is that? Because it will upset your father. Ahh. Hmm. Hmm. No. Your father wants smoked turkey breast from Morton's Deli. He likes that better. Okay. Well, we can go there after, or I can just go by myself. Can I help you find anything? He wants pepper jam. He likes pepper jam. Don't ask me why. Yeah. I'm gonna go find it. - Yo! - Yo, Jacko. Can't believe you picked up, man. Hey, how's the old man? How you surviving in that nuthouse? Oh, my God. I can't believe it's only been 18 hours. Hey, you know, if it's too cold, you can always ask Mom to turn up the heat. Ha ha ha. That's funny. Hey, did you hear, like, a weird noise in the Mercedes when you were driving it? You mean the sound like someone threw a toaster into the dryer? Yeah, that's the one. You didn't do anything about it? Yeah, yeah. You know, I was so busy. How long are you gonna be there? I don't know. They need somebody here. Well, what else do you have to do, right? I mean, I've got a meeting coming up. Listen, I'll check in with you later. Yeah, all right. Yes. Yeah. All right. Shit. Sorry. Mom. Oh, somebody stole my purse. Here. And where did all this wine come from? It was me. Where did you go? I was here. Are you drinking too much? No, you were not here, and, no, I'm not drinking too much, okay? I... I didn't know you like red wine. Yeah, well, that's 'cause they don't sell bourbon here. Red wine gives me a headache. Mom, you're giving me a headache. ...in just about 18, so it seems it has quietly crept down as this market is shooting up, and this reflation train becomes really more of a reality... So, Nate... Hmm? how's the book? Oh. I'm working on a play now. A play? There's some producers that are interested. Didn't know you wrote plays. I'm learning as I go. Ah. Well, I'm guessing, uh, - it's not a musical. - No. No, it's more Beckett than Broadway. Yeah, the guy who pitched for the Red Sox? No, no. He's a playwright, Samuel Beckett. Oh, that Beckett. Dad... don't start. You still proofreading at that... that ad agency? Yeah, yeah. They call me when they need me. Are you giving up on the novel? No, I'm not giving up on the novel. I just put the novel on hold. I'm working on a play now. Well, is somebody trying to sell it? No, I don't sell it. The producers set it up, and they... It's complicated. I'm going to bed. All right. Good night, Dad. As we mentioned earlier, stocks are marginally higher. Housing data... All right. See you in the morning. See you in the morning. Alex? That's right, Dierdre. It's really a rally led by the financials. I mean, take a look at the names like JPMorgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley really catapulting higher, leading this rally in the S&P. What an animal. Whatever it was, it must have been pretty big and vicious to have done that. Right on both counts, New York. I was tussling with the most dangerous animal in the world, a woman. She must have been Tarzan's mate. Okay. I'm going to bed, too. Will you take care of the lights? All right. Good night, Mom. The only one I keep on is the, uh, one in the center of the kitchen in case I want to get up at night. Okay. I'll figure it out. I'll show you where the switches are. No, it's... I'll figure it out. - Yeah? You sure? - Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. They're lights, Mom. Unless one of them is a self-destruct button for the building, I think I'll figure it out, okay? What does that mean? That's a joke. Ha ha. Good night. Good night. ...known a million dames like that. Two million. Yeah. Stopped the car, opened the door. "Take another hour and stop here, sister," I told her. That's the stuff. As I was going on. If you want to see a real scar, brother, get a load of this. I'm gonna turn the heat up. I'm cold. Aren't you cold, honey? No. It's hot in here, Mom. I don't know, honey. Parents are getting old. Yeah. I was afraid that was gonna happen. Well, one day, another kid and I took 'em down. The old man wasn't around. We had a duel. What? I think when we get back home this April, we have to look into Elmwood. Have we talked about that to you? That's a... Assisted living community. Okay. Your father doesn't want to do it. You know him. He hates old people. Shuts me up every time I mention it, but I'm gonna need more and more help, and I don't want to burden him with it. I-I'll look into it, Mom. It's very nice. He's scared. He's so scared. He doesn't want you to know. He doesn't want to show it. He panics every time I leave the room for five minutes, you know. He loves you, Mom. Yeah, he loves me. Okay. - Good night, sweetheart. - Good night, Mom. I don't want to be late. We're not gonna be late. She cleared this time just for me. Of course she did. I hate leaving your father, but a manicure just makes me feel human. Sure. Me, too. Why are you doing that? I'm just trying to see if it's the engine or the drivetrain. You're gonna break it. Whatever. It's already broken. You said it's on Pineapple, right? North or South? - Oh. - Well, just pick one. - Uh, it's to the right. - All right. All right, all right! I'm gonna go. No, it's to the... I know, but there's cars behind me. I have to make a choice. Look familiar? No. - No? - Doesn't look familiar? Okay, I'm gonna turn around then. No, no, no. It's okay. It's fine. You sure? Yeah. It's... This is Pineapple. Just wait here, okay? Are you Shelly? Yeah, I'm Shelly. Good. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. - Hi, honey. - Hi, darling. I'm so sorry about Bob. You know my youngest son, don't you, Nathan? You met him before? No, but you have told me a lot about him. You're the writer? - Yeah, I'm... I'm a writer. - Yeah. And your brother is a lawyer, a politician? He's a lobbyist. He bribes politicians. I love your mother, just love her. Yeah, she's... she's the greatest. So do... do I just wait here? Yeah. You can wait in there. Uh, it's gonna be about an hour, maybe more. Is there... Is there maybe a place that I could... - Get a drink? - Yeah. That... That would be great. Yeah, just a couple blocks north, Banks Channel. Great burgers... - Okay. - if you're hungry. Yeah, okay. I'll be back, Mom. You open? Yeah. Sit anywhere you like. Can I start you out with something? Yes. Bourbon. Yeah, what do you like? Jack. And a cheeseburger, medium? Plain? Uh, do you have pepper jack? Hang on. Oh. The Tijuana Tornado... - Yep. - looks awesome. - All right. It is. - Thank you. I'll go put your order in. Appreciate it. Can I get you another one? Oh, yeah. Yeah? Same glass? Uh-huh. That'll work. All righty. Why don't you go buy her a drink? She looks familiar. I think... I don't know. Maybe she was on my flight or something. So buy her a drink. What's she drinking? Who cares? O-Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'll buy her a drink. - All right. - Sure. Look at you. Good man. All right. Okay. Well, that did not seem to work. Oh, what'd you expect? Did you think she was gonna fling herself at you because you bought her a $14 martini? - That was $14? - Yeah. You gotta pay for the good vodka, honey. That's worse than New York. Hello. Hi. I think you might have been on my flight the other day from New York? Oh, yeah. It's possible. - Yeah? - Yeah. Let me guess. You're here for the same reason that I am. Your parents are just driving you crazy, right? Had to get a drink, read a little David Foster Wallace? My grandparents. What's that? I'm visiting my grandparents. Oh, your grandparents, okay. That... That's nice of you. It's nice of them to have me. I'm Nathan. - Your hamburger. - My what? The waitress just put your food on the bar. Oh, right. Okay, well, it was, uh... - It was nice talking to you. - Alex. - Uh, Nathan. - No, my name's Alex. That's... That's why you came over here, right? Yes. Okay. You wanted to ask me. Yeah, I... Yes. That's why I... It was nice talking to you. Well, if you want to talk again, you can find me at the Shore Club by the pool. Okay. Shore Club. Alex. Alex. Okay, can you make it at 10:15? Oh, that's great. That's great. And that is with Joanne. Whoa. Shit. Oh, man. Wonderful. We'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Bye-bye. Okay. Oh, God. Mm, what? I need a tow truck. I'm at the, uh, Beyond Beauty Day Spa. Okay. Uh, it's a silver Mercedes. The hood is open. You can't miss it. Okay, called the tow truck. They said about 20 minutes or so. What are we gonna tell your father? It's a car, Mom. They break down, especially if you ignore loud noises for months at a time. I'm just gonna call him and tell him. No, no, no! He's sleeping! I don't want to wake him up. I don't want you to call him. Yeah, but we're gonna be an hour late, maybe two. We have to call him. No. Fine. So, uh, your mom's been telling me that your girlfriend's book is coming out next month? Yeah. Are you excited? Eh, not really. A lot of our friends are writers, so we just think of it as a job. He doesn't get excited. No, I... I get excited, Mom. Yeah, you don't get happy excited. You get anxious excited. Wonder where I get that from? W-What's it about? It's a novel? Uh, yeah. It's about a psychiatrist who becomes convinced that her patient is really her daughter who she was told was stillborn two decades earlier. And is she? Yeah, and she's not. It's... It's sort of metaphysical. Hmm. I'll lend you mine when I'm finished with it. I'm getting an autographed copy. You know my other son? Yeah, we've gone over this, Mom. He works in Washington, D.C. He protects all those poor banks from those greedy taxpayers. He does a lot more than that. No, that's pretty much what he does, Mom. He lives in a beautiful house in Maryland with his wife Kathy and two adorable daughters. Yeah, and he's been getting fat from eating all those wiener dogs at cocktail receptions and parties. He is looking a little unhealthy. I worry about him. I worry about you, too. What are you worried about me for? I worry about how you're gonna make a living doing what you do. I mean, Erika's book could make a lot of money, but you can't count on that. No, you can't. Oh, listen. Daddy's going to be so upset. Don't worry about that. I got you. I'm worried about Daddy, 'cause he's gonna be upset with you. No, that's okay. I can handle it. Yeah, you'll see... You got it? Scoot over. ...when he gets upset. I'm gonna sit here. - Nathan? - Yeah? The music's so loud. This isn't right. Yeah, I know, but what can we do? I'll take her home. Do you live by my folks? Oh, um, no, I don't, but it's okay. I'll take her home. - You sure? - Yeah. Yeah. Let's get her down from that truck. All right, thanks. And the bartender says... "Why the long face?" Yes! Oh! Bingo! I don't understand it at all. Why would you say that? What's going on? Ah, sweetheart, come on in. The first time I leave you guys alone, you throw a party? What'd you do to my fucking car? I didn't do anything to your car. Did you not hear the grinding? No, I didn't hear any grinding, and your mother didn't say anything about it. Your brother didn't say anything about it. Yeah, because you scare everybody. They don't want to say anything. I didn't do anything to it. I don't know. Are you drinking red wine, Mom? Yeah, it's good. Do you want some? Go get some. Get a glass. I love these chips, too, by the way. They're fantastic. The salt is so... Do you not have any wineglasses? Oh, darling, just use a regular glass. No, no, you can't use a regular glass for wine. Doesn't taste right. Isn't that right, Nate? It is true, actually. See? He knows these things. - What's wrong with my fucking car? - Gourmand. The service department was closed. They're gonna call tomorrow. You did something to it. No, you did, you or your brother. Okay, it must have been us. Couldn't have been you. You know, the first time after he got his driver's license, he totaled the car we bought him. A brand-new Mustang, right up a tree. - Don't. - Were you okay? He was looking at this girl. He wa... Yeah, he was fine. He was in... When he was in the hospital getting the... Had a couple stitches. - Stitches. - Stitches. Stitches. He says, "Hey, Dad, Dad, when do we get the insurance money?" He loves this story. The little shit wanted the insurance money so he'd get another car. I don't suppose you gave it to him. You bet I didn't give it to him. I let him walk to school. Teach him a lesson in responsibil... Not that he ever learned it. You know, you didn't have to do this. No. I just had to get out of there. God. Oh, thank you. No... - That didn't come out right. - Uh-uh. No, seriously, thanks for... thanks for driving my mom. She could not have handled that maniac tow-truck driver and the repair shop. No, I love your mother, and your dad always cracks me up. I didn't realize you guys have met before. Yeah. Usually he sits and waits while your mom gets her nails done. - Really? - Mm-hmm. You're kidding me. He's got the patience of a two-year-old. Ah, he just reads a paper or a magazine. - Huh. - You know, I can see how it might not be easy to be their son. - You can see that? - Yeah. I was starting to feel like a bad person. No. You know, I'm sure it's hard to be in this small apartment with them for a week. That's how long you're here, right? I don't know. Honestly, I just broke up with my girlfriend. Wow. A-Are you okay? No. I mean, she left me for somebody else, and she's with him right now, which leaves me feeling slightly nauseated. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm so sorry. I haven't even told my parents yet. They love Erika. Oh, well, I'm not sure about that. What do you mean? Did they say something? No, nothing in particular. They... I just get the feeling they're not sure that she's the right girl for you. They look out for you and your brother. Yeah, I think that's called meddling. - No, no. - Yeah. No, it's sweet. And you know what? You're gonna miss it someday. Not really gonna miss that so much. I don't know about that. Oh, I... That's what made me love your mother. It's the way she talks about her kids. She just loves every single detail about your lives. And the grandkids! Oh, she loves the grandkids. Oh! I mean, the first time that your dad had a stroke, her only thought was for them. Wait. What do you mean, the first time my dad had a stroke? Oh, God. I... Did he have another stroke? They never said anything. It was, like, a year ago. - I'm so sorry. - Huh. I... I didn't mean to spill any family secrets. I just... You know, women tell their manicurists everything. They're just sitting there for hours with their hands occupied, so their mouths go on overdrive. - I am so sorry. - Don't be sorry. It's not your fault my family's crazy. Okay? - Um, I gotta go... - Okay. because I have to open the shop in the morning, but it was really nice meeting you. It was great meeting you. Thanks again. Oh, it's my pleasure. Hey, I'm... You know, I'm gonna be here for a while, so maybe we could get coffee or lunch. Oh, I would love that. - Okay. - Yeah. - All right. - Okay. Call the salon. Okay, yeah. - Sounds good. - Okay. - All right. - Bye. - Get home safe. - Thanks. All things considered, your mother's doing well. I'm going to change her medication to Memantine, which I think will be effective. Well, if she's doing well, why are you changing her medication? Honey, the doctor knows what he's doing. I know. I know. I'm just gonna ask him. That's okay, Mrs. Fisher. You have to understand what doing well means in this context. There's been steady cognitive deterioration, but the rate of decline has been relatively moderate. But she is getting worse. Yes, but we're essentially trying to delay the progression of some of the symptoms. There's nothing we can actually do to delay the progression of the disease itself. You... You get the distinction? Yeah. Mom, do you understand? Oh, yes. I understand. Okay. Do you mind if I ask Dr. Black a question alone for a second? Th-There's nothing we can't discuss in front of your mother. She's... She's fully aware of everything. Yeah. This was more about me, though. Shoot. Um... is there anything I can do to prevent getting Alzheimer's in the future? You have the markers? Yeah. I mean, sometimes I forget things. Yeah, so do I. You could get tested. You'd have a better idea of the odds you're looking at, but I wouldn't recommend that. - Why not? - Well, if it's positive, there's nothing you can do about it. There's nothing I can do? Research. This is Erika. Hey. Uh, this isn't a good time. It isn't, is it? I'll talk to you, but later. Look, I just have to ask you one question, okay? Simple answer. What? Have you been going out with this David guy? Yes. And have you been sleeping with him? Yes. Okay. See, that's good. That's really good, 'cause I've... I been feeling shitty, staying up all night, wondering if I should feel shitty, and now I know I can... I can just feel shitty. Thanks for that. Okay. Okay. Bye. Wait. Are your parents okay? No. Remember, my mom has Alzheimer's? My dad had a stroke? It's not gonna get any better. That's what you said, right? You sound like you're at the beach. Yeah. Well, enjoy it. It's cold and rainy in New York. Thanks for the weather report. Nathan, I'm just trying to normalize things between us. Oh, normalize? Is... Is that what normal people talk about, the weather? Oh. Is that just what famous writers think the rest of us spend our time talking about? - You know what your problem is, Erika? - Nathan... You think that by publishing this book, it's gonna somehow transform your life, like... like you're gonna walk into a restaurant, and people are gonna whisper, "Ooh, look, "that's Erika Bryce. She's a famous writer. - She published a novel." - Nathan... Well, you know what? No one's gonna give a shit that you published a book, okay? Look around the F train during rush hour. I bet you there's a ton of people cramped in that car, and five of 'em have published books. They're just as uncomfortable and irritated as everybody else! H-Hello? You still there? I like this one. You doing a series? I guess you could say that, yeah. Yeah. Eh, you got a lot of 'em? Come back another afternoon, I'll show you... next time I see you. You always in the same spot right here? Around here... when the... when the light's good. All right. See you then. Good morning, sir. Morning. Can I have a Bloody Mary? Are you a guest here? Yeah, I guess. I mean, are you a guest of a member? Oh. Well, I-I'm meeting someone here, and her name's Alex. She's a brunette, very pretty. - Mm-hmm. - Uh... Yeah, that's describing about half the women here. Can I just get a drink, please? Okay. Could really use a Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. Thanks, man. Be right back. Here you are. Thank you. Yeah, you just act like you belong here. When someone asks, you just found that here. Thanks again. All right. What the fuck? Mom? Hi, honey. Hey. You're a long way from home. - I am? - Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am. Do you know where you are? Of course I do. I just didn't think you'd want to be this far away from Dad. Dad's asleep. Jack is keeping an eye on everything. Jack's not here, Mom. He was here last week. I'm pretty sure he is. No, Mom, he's not. All right, how long have you been out for? I don't know. Not sure. All right, we're gonna get you home, okay? Did I tell you Erika called? Did she call again? Again? Yeah. I talked to her. No, well, you said she called a couple days ago. I... I just want to make sure. Did she call once or twice? Uh, I'm not sure. Once. - Yes, once. - Huh. You don't like her, do you, Mom? I like her. Not sure I like her for you. Huh. It's ruts, you know. Yeah, I know, but this is where you're from. - Yeah. - Look at this. - What? - See? Family reunion time. - Hey. - Hey. Look at that. - How 'bout that? - Okay. Good to see you, bud. I didn't know you were coming. So nice to see my boys together. Spur-of-the-moment thing. Drove to the airport, got on a plane. You think capitalism will survive a couple days without you? Let's grab lunch. I'll make something. No, we'll go out. It'll do you both some good. - I'm not going out. - No? Come on. I rented an SUV. There's plenty of room. Sure you don't want to go, Dad? Yeah, I'm sure. Go out with your brother. Take your mother with you. No, no. I'm not going without you. Go ahead. Have some fun. I just got here. So how long you staying for? I don't know. - You spending the night? - At least. I took your stuff from the other bed in the guest room, got rid of it. - What? - Yeah. - Purple? - Yeah. Really? Yeah. For her. Sweet. Really? Maybe we should play some golf this week. Yeah, I don't really golf anymore. Well, then we should definitely play golf this week. Don't you have to be a member to eat here? - We are members. - What? Mom and Dad are members. We have a family membership. Huh. I did not know that. Dad never comes here. He hates it. Want to sit here? Yeah. So I looked into Elmwood. Yeah? Mm-hmm. It's pretty great. - Hmm - But there's a catch. What's that? So you know when you're trying to get your kids into a really good private school? Well, you wouldn't know, but... I'm not totally ignorant, okay? I do have friends with kids. All right, all right. It's harder to get in a few years down the road when you're really infirm, okay? They want people to buy in when they're still relatively healthy so they can stay on the program until... you know, till the end, right? So it's like school in reverse. Yes, it's like school in reverse. You know that scene in "2001" where Dave is removing HAL's memory units? As HAL's memory fades, he becomes all childlike and docile till he remembers the first thing that he was ever taught, that song "Daisy." Daisy? You know... ♪ Daisy, Daisy ♪ ♪ Give me your answer true ♪ What are you talking about? You don't know that movie? No, I've never seen the movie. Oh, my God. That's a classic. I thought we were talking about Mom and Dad... - We were! - not your favorite movies. - Jesus, just can you... - I was free associating. - We were talking about... - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen. My point is, if we want to get them into this place, we gotta do it now. I know, but Dad doesn't want to go. God, that woman's hot. Her name's Alex. "Her name's Alex." You've been here three days. "Her name's Alex." - Hey. - Hey. How are you? You remember me, right? Sure. If you're in town for a little bit... What was that about? Asked her out on a date. I hope she let you down gently. She said no to dinner... but she said yes to lunch. What about Erika? Oh, yeah. She's fucking somebody else. Is that a good thing? For whom? For you. No. I'm fucking heartbroken. I'm just trying to make the best of it. Good night, boys. - Good night, Mom! - Good night, Mom! Y-You're a cop? As we mentioned earlier, stocks are marginally high... Mark my words. We have crossed a very dangerous line here in America, and it's not a line in the sand. It's now written in stone... Would you change this, please? - To what? - Anything else. You said you didn't care what you were watching. Now we're gonna watch this. We have traded leaders who celebrate success, - who celebrate freedom... - Come on. You don't actually buy this crap, do you? If you had a job and made some money, you'd understand what he's saying. Jack, I thought you were just doing this wing-nut thing because it paid well. I didn't picture you sucking it up in your spare time. So you're saying it's better to be a cynical hypocrite than it is to be an honest conservative? - I'm saying change the channel. - No. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna... I can't believe this guy. He's in a wheelchair. So? What, are you prejudiced against the disabled now? No, but he's going on against government regulation about things that could actually help people who need help. Exactly. And look at what he's accomplished in his life. Look at how far he's come without government handouts. Government'll be your mommy. Yeah, if you call being a loudmouth douche bag an accomplishment. Change the channel. Come on. Give me the remote. Come on. I'm just gonna change the channel myself. Don't do it. ...to help in sentiment, Alex Steele has... I have the power. I'm gonna unplug it. Don't do that. Don't you do that. I'm unplugging... Don't do that. Get out of there! Ow! You just hit me! Not on purpose. You just hit me hard! I can still kick your ass. Oh, you want to. - Huh? You want to? - Come on. - You want to? - You want to? Give that fucking... No! Get off! Aah! Stop it. Stop it! What's the matter with you? Fighting. You're gonna wake your father. Get back in your own bed. Get off of me. Good. Now you've done it. He started it. Did not. He's full of shit. Freezing in here. I'm turning up the heat. It's 10:00 at night. What the hell are we doing lying in bed? Let's get out of here. Let's go. So when are you going back? I don't know. Don't you have to get back for work? I don't have a job. What did you say? I got fired. Oh. I had a thing with a woman in the office. I was... What, they fired you for that? Just so happens that she is the daughter of the CFO of one of our biggest clients... - Oh, fuck. - so there's that. At least tell me she wasn't an intern, please. She was getting paid... a stipend. Jesus Christ. Does Kathy know? Yeah. She knows. She's not letting me see the kids. How long has... I mean, when did... About 4 1/2 months ago. 4 1/2 months. I figured we'd work it out quickly, so I put myself up at the Ritz-Carlton. Didn't really turn out that way, so now I'm at the La Quinta Suites Rosslyn. "Suites" sounds luxurious. I'm running out of money. And I can't get unemployment. I'm sorry. Did you say, "Unemployment"? Yeah. You fucking hypocrite. - It's a big day for it. - Hmm. Big day. Big day. That's huge. Yeah. Jesus Christ, Jack. Mom and Dad are happy because of you. You had the wife, kids, big house, two German cars. I was allowed to just do whatever the hell I wanted to. You had to go and fuck that up for me, huh? My apologies. Thank you for caring so much about your big brother, you piece of shit. Yeah, next time you fuck an intern, just think of me first, please. I'll take it. What? Look at that. Jesus Christ. They have actual Germans back there? Oh, that sucks. What are you doing? Didn't Dad give you money? Dad's not gonna give me money. What do you... Am I supposed to pay for this? I mean, I don't even think I have... I don't have that much cash. I definitely... I know I don't. I just... I don't... Should we just... - Split it. - split it? Is there anything that's not deep-fried here? There's oysters. Yeah, that's like the one thing that's better deep-fried. I love places like this, though, clam shacks. Yeah. I guess it has its appeal. It kind of reminds me of this... this place we used to go to as kids in Maine. So, what do you do, Mr. Nathan? I'm a writer. But don't ask me if you've read anything I've written, because you haven't. So you're a ghostwriter? A what? That was a joke. Little double entendre? Yeah. Um, so what... so what do you write, then? Well, I started a novel once, but I'm working on a play now. And you keep them in a box hidden under your bed? I actually keep them on a hard drive. Saves paper. That was supposed to be a joke, too. Yeah. Heh heh. Okay. - We can both tell bad jokes. - Yeah. No, your joke was good. Mine was bad. So, wait. Y-You started a novel. That's awesome. What happened? Yeah, I started the novel, but then... I felt like I should be working on the play, but now I'm thinking I should go back to the novel. But I don't know. I don't know. You don't know? Don't you think you're a little too old to still be figuring it out? - Old? - You know, like by the time they reach your age, most people who haven't really succeeded in art usually join a law school or something. I'm only 35. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Well, what about you? What do you... What do you like to read? I like David Foster Wallace and, uh, Michel Houellebecq, think they're my favorite. That's pretty heavy. Where do you find time to read those? Do... Do you work? I... I collect alimony, and I travel. Aren't you a little young for that? Well, I'm... I'm 25. Like I said. Well, you know, I gave it my best shot. Let me guess. He was a lot older than you. Yeah, about your age. Wow. Hello. I'm gonna have the... fried clams and the onion rings. Boom. How was your date with the bod? It was pretty good. She's French, so she's very up-front. Did you get that little tingle in your balls? What the fuck is your problem, man? Just want to know if you're gonna try to fill the doughnut. Did you just say, "Fill the doughnut"? Seriously? Who talks like that? Whoo! Motherfucking slice! Damn it! You know how much money I've spent - to try to get rid of that? - Yeah. Why don't you just aim it a little farther to the left? Because you don't do that, Nathan. You don't compensate for your weaknesses. You overcome them. That sounds like an excellent philosophy. Fuck you. You don't even play! You want to know my secret? What's your secret? I just don't give a shit. Hah! That'll get you far in life. Well, it's got me two strokes up on you. Thought you didn't give a shit. Yeah. Still want to beat you, though. What? You gonna ask her out again? Yeah, sure. She's really beautiful, and she... I think she's smart. Did you give her an IQ test at lunch? That's pretty romantic. No, I can tell by the type of books she reads. Right. Like Erika? I'm trying to help you! Don't bother helping me! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ma! You understand what your father is going through? Of course I do. I didn't mean to upset him. You didn't? How could this not upset him, Jack? He seemed all right. He seemed all... He's gone off to sleep! He's not all right with it! Mom, what's going on? I can't talk about this. Ma, it's gonna be all right. I'll take care of it! I'm sorry, Ma! I told them. Everything? Bullet points. They're really pissed off. At you? Of course at me. Dad started yelling. Mom started yelling that I was upsetting Dad. All this happened while I was in the shower? Dude, you were in there for, like, a half an hour. I asked Dad if I could borrow some money. How much? 200. Thousand? No, $200. Of course 200,000. What the fuck, Jack? I'm underwater. I overpaid for my house. Real estate's in the shitter. I took out a second mortgage, I can't get any credit, and I've been spending like crazy since she threw me out. Okay, hold on. You've been out there in D.C. working for the banking industry, helping them fuck people out of money, right? I just think that's a little ironic. Ah, irony, yes, the last refuge of the hipster. Are they handing out medals in Brooklyn for spotting irony? This is why you came back? - No, it's not. - It is. No, it's not. You came back to ask for money. - Bullshit. No. - Well, you did. You just asked him. I came here because I have no place else to go! Plus we are losing them. Don't you see that? Bit by bit, we're losing them. I think you're trying to blame me for this. No, no, but it is your fault. You know, that's just a sign of your own insecurity. Insecurity? What do I have to be insecure about? Because I have a successful career, and you know it. Well, that's ridiculous. So when am I gonna see my girls again? You'll see your girls again, Ma. I'm gonna take care of this, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. I'd like to see them while I still know them. You'll know them, Ma! Dad? Dad, you okay? - Darling? - Dad! Honey? I fucked up. I'm sorry, Ma. I'm so sorry. God. Well, it wasn't another stroke. He's asleep now. May I see him, please? What was it? He just passed out. I'd like to see him, please. So, stress? Stress can never be ruled out. He'll be asleep until morning. May I see him, please? - Can she see him? - Sure. - Dr. Mattam. - Yes? She's ready for release. We just need your signature. Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandma. Ah, I didn't know you could do this. Hi, sweeties. Oh, look at you. It's wonderful to see you. Hi, Molly. I'm Ashley. Oh, of cour... I know that. I know you're Ashley. You're growing up so fast. Hi, Molly. How old are you now? I'm five. Well, almost five. Ohh. And, Ashley, honey, how old are you? I'm nine, Grandma. You're so beautiful. I just want to look at you. You're beautiful, too, Grandma. Oh, yeah? You think? Aww. And how old are you now? I just said, Grandma. I'm nine. Oh, yeah. Well, you're so big. Okay, goodbye, girls. Bye, Daddy. Bye, Daddy. Thank you, darling. Hi. I'm looking for my Dad. He's out getting a PET scan. Oh, okay. He told me about you. Oh. Yeah, I'll bet he did. Red hair. So when's he gonna be back? Several hours probably. All right, 'cause I've got his clothes here and got his computer. This is really important that he gets this. Of course. I'll keep an eye on it. How's he doing? Oh, he's good. Yeah? Oh, yeah. Okay. I'll be back. It's the stories, you know. - Yeah. - I ju... I love the stories. Do you ever hear anything that's really disturbing? Oh, yeah, every detail. See, you should be writing a book. I could introduce you to people. "Tales of a Manicurist." Oh, yeah, that's not in the cards. You should, though. All you have to do is just listen, take some notes. Well, I don't think that my clients would appreciate it. Like, I mean, we kind of have an understanding. Like a manicurist-client privilege. That's it, exactly. It's a well-known doctrine. I want to hear about your play. My play. Your phone's ringing. Yeah. My ex. Oh. You... You can take it if you want. I'll take a hike. I really don't want to talk to her. Okay. Then tell me about your play. I would love to. It's an historical drama based on the life of an Italian named Enrico Malatesta. I don't know who that is. He was an anarchist, sort of the Abbie Hoffman of his day. - I do know who Abbie Hoffman is. - Okay. His mother used to come in and get her nails done. - Really? - No. Malatesta, he lived in the late 19th, early 20th century... - Okay. - and, um... it's a whole... You really do not want to hear this. If you think I don't want to hear it, why are you writing about it? Uh... I don't know. I really don't know. Shoot, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... No. That's... It's just that when things are important to people, really important, good or bad, they... they like to talk about them, you know? - Mm-hmm. - Can I tell you what I think? Please. I think you should be writing your novel. How did you know I had a novel? Your dad, he told me. He said it had a lot of promise. He told you about it, huh? I think it's obvious why you abandoned the novel. I'm sorry. She's not gonna stop. Do you mind? - Yeah. - Give me a second. No, go ahead. Hey. Hi. How are you? How are your parents? I'm good, but that's not why you're calling. I got my PW this morning. Have you been crying? They hated it. They just hate it. They called it an undistinguished debut. That's just one review. Those people are all frustrated writers. That was the best one. Did you see what Bookslut said? - No. I haven't really been... - Listen. "Ms. Bryce's reach far exceeds her grasp. She's drifting aimlessly in an intellectual firmament where she clearly has no bearings." Oh, thank you. This one's from Beatrice. "The experience of reading this novel is akin to being forced to watch a particularly bad soap opera with a freshmen psychology student sitting beside you, offering a running commentary on the proceedings. There might have been some camp value in the overwrought narrative, but it drowned in the insistent exposition of Ms. Bryce's interior monologue." I'm sorry. Fucking blogger bitches. Who the fuck told them they could have an opinion? Yeah. I think Beatrice is actually a dude. It's not how it was supposed to go. You know, it's not how it was supposed to go. I was gonna get my starred PW, and my editor was gonna call me and take me to lunch, and we were gonna celebrate, and then I was gonna be in "New York" magazine. Yeah, and you were going to be dating a hot, young literary agent. Yeah, I deserve that. Yeah. Look, Erika, I'm sorry things aren't working out for you, but I gotta go. You knew that my book was bad. Well, not bad, but that it had problems, and you tried to tell me, and I didn't listen. I'm sorry, Nathan. - Well... - All right. thank you. That was a nice break. You owe me 8.99 for your tacos, by the way. Oh. Wait. Hold on one second. Look, I'm sorry. I just... I realize you paid for the lunch, and I was on my phone the whole time. You did. You took a phone call. Yeah. That was an awful, awful lunch for you. It's probably not in the top 10 worst dates I've ever had, so... Yeah. Well, I didn't know it was a date. Oh. No, it's... No, 'cause if it was a date, I wouldn't talk about myself the whole time, and I might ask you a couple questions. 'Cause I really don't know that much about you. That's okay. You have a lot on your plate right now. Yeah, how much time do you have? I have, like, five minutes. Is it too late to ask you a question now? Uh, actually, that would be lovely. Go ahead. Okay, I'll make it quick. - Okay. - One question. How the hell did you end up in Florida with a nail salon? Oh. Um, well, here's the short version. This place belonged to my aunt, and I was going to school in Michigan, and I would come down for winter and spring breaks and just hang out, and I started working here. And, um... then she got sick, and I finished college, so I just stayed for a few years and helped her out. And, um, when she died, I couldn't just... I mean, I could have sold it, but I... I didn't. You got time for one more question? Man, you are pushing it. Can we go on a real date? - Ooh. - And I won't wear shorts, - and I will pay... - Ooh! and ask you questions. And we can have real plates and not paper plates, maybe even use linen napkins. Oh, are you sure? Yeah. Why wouldn't I be sure? Okay, look, here's the deal. If you ask me out, I'm gonna say yes. Can you just do me a favor and take a moment and just... just think about it, okay? Yeah, okay. - Okay. - All right. Good. Whoa. Yeah, whoa. That's right. Maybe you should take a walk around the neighborhood, relax a little bit. You can't be passing out like that. You scared the shit of everyone. Good. Ah, Theresa, Theresa, Theresa, Theresa. - This is my son, Nate. - Hi. - Hey. - You know, I think your dad here - faked the whole thing so he could come back and annoy me. - Yeah. - I don't like you that much. - Mm-hmm. When am I getting out of here? Well, the doctor will be here in about an hour, and we will let him decide. Well, tell him to hurry up, will you? Have you been taking your meds? I do whatever you tell me, Theresa. Yeah, sure you do. Okay, you behave, and I'll be back. That's going too... going too far. You're right. She's pretty cute. Hmm. You doing all right? You like freckles. Brother was here earlier. Yeah. Ah, boy. - He fucked his life up. - Yeah. Fucked it up. He did, but he's gonna figure it out. Yeah, well, he will, or he won't. - And you? - What? Well, you haven't made any major commitments, so you haven't made any big mistakes, but where the fuck are you? I'm getting there, okay? I'm getting there. You gonna marry that... No. No. We broke up. Well, that's good. Yeah? Pretentious little thing. Bookslut was right about her. You saw that? Yeah. I have Google Alert out for her. I got one out for you, too. I'm still waiting. I'm sorry. Give me the goddamn keys, will you? You can't drive, Dad, not even when you walk. It's my fucking car. Just give me the keys. Don't argue with me. I'm driving, okay? That's final. What a difference. Needed attention. Oh, yeah, just a little love. You know, you can thank me anytime. What for? You said you didn't do anything, so I'm taking you at your word. You're welcome. So I know we... we never really... never really talked about it, but h-how you doing with Mom? What do you mean? How you doing? You guys all right? We're losing her. Now, you know that, right? Yeah. Well... that's how it is. I'm sorry, Dad. Yes. Hmm. Mmm, smells so good. - Can I help? - No. - No, - I'm cooking tonight. You just sit down. Mm-hmm. I'm making a little shrimp scampi. Mmm. You like that? Love it. So wonderful to have my boys here. It's good to be here. Mm. So did you have a good time with Shelly? I did. I like her. Yeah, she's a good girl, huh? She is. Yeah, she is. Check. You know, she told me that Dad had a stroke last year. Very small one. Why did you not tell me that? Oh, darling, please. Mom, I would have come down. You know your father likes to do things his own way. His own way? That's... That's a big deal. Nathan, he drove himself to the hospital. Are you kidding me? I don't want to talk about this right now. We have to talk... Not now. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Oh! We should take a walk on the beach tomorrow. Why? 'Cause it'd be good for you to get out. I hate the beach. I never set foot on it. Never? What'd I just say? It's right here. It's right at your door. Yeah. Well, why... why the hell do you live in Florida? You can live anywhere in the world, New York, Paris. For your mother. The sun's good for Alzheimer's, they say. Check. Shit. What? I smell good? - You smell wonderful. - Yeah? You smell like the sea. I gotta go home. You do what you need to do, but... yeah... it's time for me to go home. Okay, but honestly, I don't think the old guy wants me here. Yeah, he does. Yeah, he does. He's not gonna... beg for your help, but... of course he does. But I gotta go. Start checking on flights. I got this. You want to go to bed? Yeah. With you. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hmm. Come on. Okay. Hey! Came by here yesterday, but you weren't here. Might have been the day before, actually. Well, sometimes when I don't like the light, I just stay home. Wow. How many of these do you have? When did you paint that? That was about four years ago. Okay. That's nice. How 'bout this one? When'd you do that? Well, that's the 1970s. Wow. Wow. Oh, that is beautiful. I love this one. Well, here. Take it. It's yours if you want it. Really? Yeah. Look at that. I appreciate it. Yeah, it's come... They forward to you. If only. Big improvement. Beautiful. See if you can get rid of that orange piece of crap over there. Mom. Bye, Mom. Bye, darling. Be safe, hmm? I love you. Yeah. Hey, it's Nathan. So I've thought hard about this. Not long, of course, but I've made up for not thinking long by thinking extra hard about it. I really want to take you on a date tonight or tomorrow or next week. It doesn't matter. I'll be around, so call me. Bye. You gotta go to Kathy, get on your hands and knees. Beg, beg, beg, beg her to forgive you, take you back. I will. I will. Thanks, Dad. All right. So that's it? Bro. - Okay! - Heh heh heh. Thank you. One for the road. Uh-huh. We'll talk soon. I'll miss you. Get out of here. Yep. Listen. With Kathy, don't cry. Never looks good. I won't. I'm gonna open the door, get some fresh air. Do that. I'll have a manicure appointment tomorrow. Can you drive me? I can drive you. No, you can't. That's, uh... That's okay. He can drive. We need to talk about Elmwood. Forget about it. No. What do you mean, forget about it? The only way I'm going to Elmwood is in an urn on your mother's mantelpiece. I'm gonna make some coffee. Hey, Mom... Yeah? can I have a mug? Of course. Thank you. I'm turning up the heat first. Okay. When are you going home? What's that? - What? - Huh? Did I tell you that Erika called? Yeah, Mom, you told me. She feels really terrible about the awful reviews she got. What's a Bookslut? It's complicated. I told her not to worry. I said it's all gonna get better. I'm gonna close this door. Or window, whatever you call it. Subtitles by explosiveskull
