Now, wait a second. Okay, bring me up camera six. Camera six on screen. How many bodies? Five. Who discovered it? I did. I was walking past the room and noticed an awful stench. One of the victims was the shooter. Find a weapon? On the floor. Colt Delta Elite. 10mm auto? Any others? Two victims had small calibers in their jackets. Not fired. Maybe a deal gone bad. We haven't identified all the victims yet. Peter Kovaks, the reporter. Suffered a gunshot wound straight to the head. Jesus Christ. This is gonna be our best story yet. I still say you're crazy. Come on! Wait. Guys, this is not how we do business! What's he doing? Leni, what the fuck? This is how... how I consummate. These idiots put a gun to my head. Polic?a not come. No one come to save you. You legit. Thank you. I appreciate that. Now could you have somebody untie me, please? Don't ever do that again. I'm not one of them, you know. One of who? North. I born in Seoul. Well, congratulations. And I care about that why? They very good do business with. You know their new embassy here? The best. Embassy is territory of home country, you know? They move goods in, out. City to city. Country to country. No one can touch. Again, why... Your goods... they're here. My goods are here? Now? You want to see? Yes, I very much want to see. Showtime. Prime. Untouched. None more than 16. I told you I could get. Unbelievable. - Yes, you did. And although I do not like your business practices, I like your results. So, as we agreed on before, 20,000 a girl? We got a deal? Deal. Okay. Let's do it. Let's go. Polic?a! Come on! Polic?a? You police? No, no Leni. No. I'm not police. No. I'm a reporter. And this is how I consummate. Fuck you! C?llate. Fuck you! Let's go. - Fuck you! They had a gun to your head, Dan. I had the police ready, but you never gave the signal. How did you know they weren't gonna kill you? I didn't. That's what I mean. Est?s loco. Alex, come on. Come on, Alex. You're acting like this is the first time we've ever worked together. You know the stories we do. Why do I think a speech is coming? We do the real stories that no one else does. The real hard-hitting ones. And then we can sell it to whatever network pays us the most. I mean, we are free. It's a beautiful thing. I don't understand. Finally. The off button. Gotta have that removed. So I was thinking for this next one we just pop on down to Morocco. A buddy of mine down there, he has a lead on a story that he says will blow this last one away. Alex. What's going on? Dan, don't you miss having a network you can call home? Are you kidding me? No. How many times we been through that? Get out. Who? UBN. I took their offer. I'm sorry, Dan. I'm gonna take a few days off, and then I leave for New York. I need you. You don't need anyone but yourself. And I need to do this for me. Hey! How's it going in sunny Spain? Broken any new hearts? Yeah, mine probably. Yeah, like that's ever gonna happen. I'm just calling to remind you it's my bachelor party in a couple weeks. Not gonna let an old friend from the neighborhood down, are you? There is nothing that can keep me from coming out there and watching you totally destroy a life of freedom and bliss. Yeah, yeah. One day you will find the right woman and then, my friend, even you will know. Yeah. I doubt it. Okay, listen. I'm just calling to check in. Stay out of trouble, okay? Why don't you go catch some bad guys there, Officer Tough Guy, and I'll see you in New York. Yeah. Yes. Yes. I love their work. I love... Work the camera. I hope you realize that that image you're filming has no need of any relays or live feeds whatsoever. As a matter of fact, yes, I do realize that. That beautiful little chip stores up to six hours of video. It's amazing? Hey, here's a question. You think you can work that camera into this jacket, maybe over the left pocket here? I don't see why not. Why? You got a hot date you want to record for posterity? I've got a meeting with an informant about a new story. Yeah, sure. Now give it to me. I'll rig it up for you in your new jacket, and I look forward to editing your new informant later on. Ha ha. Thanks, Ludovic. Hotel Vincci Soho, por favor. Dan! Dan! Do you have a brother who lives in Paseo de Gracia? Yeah. Yeah, I think he still lives there. Why? Well, his wife has been trying to reach you. She called like several times and... What, Yolanda, what? I'm sorry, Dan. Your brother's dead. Hola. Hola. Kathryn! Look how big you've gotten. My gosh. I'm your Uncle Dan. Do you remember me? I brought this for you. A present.Regalo. It's a picture book. Have you seen my daddy? Kathryn. Could you please go to your room? Mama... Please, honey? Yeah. It's been so long. It's good to see you. I'm sorry. Does she even know? I told her, but I guess she doesn't understand yet. I'm not so sure I understand. Come in. Police found him at the Medina Royal. Four others, too. The only thing they've told me is that it looks like murder-suicide. Really? Murder-suicide? Yeah. Murder-suicide. What was he doing there? Working on a story. About what? I don't know. He never spoke of his assignments. But this one seemed... I don't know. Just different. This doesn't make any sense. I know. Dan, I know you guys had your problems, but, um... did you ever try... I meant to call him so many times, and then a week became two weeks, became a month, became a year. I guess I'm just stubborn. You weren't alone. Peter didn't exactly approve of the kind of reporting I do. For Christ's sake, he won a Pulitzer. You weren't that different, Dan. The last time I saw him, I think he said... I slop around the mud like a pig or something. Peter loved you. He wanted the best for you. Mommy! I want something from you, Dan. I need you to find out what you can about Peter's death. No, no, Juliana. I didn't come here for that. I just came to make sure you and Kathryn were okay. Dan, please. Mommy, please come here! There's something else here. I... I can feel it. Just think about it? Hey, look at that. What do you have there? My dollhouse. Yes, it's a big house. I remember this thing. I can't believe he's still got it. Dan? Okay, I'll do it. I'll see what I can find out. I take it I found the crime scene? You're another one from Interpol? Because I can't let you in unless... Interpol? Yeah. That's me. Are the rest of my agents, here? They left about a half hour ago. Story of my life. So what do you think happened here? Only what I hear. Tragedy. Killings. Suicide. Yeah. Murder-suicide. That's what they're saying. Room was locked from the inside. You know what? Can you just stop what you're doing here for a minute and give me some time with this crime scene? I need to check a few things out. Yes. I appreciate that. Gracias. God. What were you doing here, Peter? Hello, sir. Natas, I was about to call you. The eye in the room at the Medina Royal has picked up someone. Lilly, please, bring it up on the screen. Who is he? Don't know yet, but he's asking questions about the event. Who's on standby? Rattori. Send it to him. Okay. He's right in front of the hotel. The only person besides me making a call here. Get a lock on his cell so we can track. Blowing up your location now. We've got a call being connected at your location. Tracking enabled. Dan, I'm so sorry about your brother. My God, I've been trying to call you. I picked up my things at the bureau, and they told me what happened. Listen, I need your Barcelona law enforcement contacts. Wait. Why? You investigating? Is that so crazy? Everything you do is crazy. Alex... please. All right. I used to know someone at the Spanish Secret Service. You a cop? Who are you? I'm Dan Kovaks. Peter Kovaks' brother. Who are you? Inspector Daniel Oro. Sorry for your loss. I was just speaking to your brother's wife. You give her more news about the murder-suicide? Come on, man, you guys can do better than that, can't you? Almost all murder-suicides are crimes of passion. The way those guys died was clean, precise, passion-less. I really hope I'm not teaching you something here, Inspector. I don't know yet why your brother was there, but I do know the four men your brother died with were all small-timers. There's often no logic in petty crime. A deal goes bad, someone pulls a weapon and boom, meeting ended. Five people murdered. Yeah, it's the murder part I get. It's the suicide part that kind of has me baffled. Good night, Dan Kovaks. Hey. Hey. What did the inspector say to you? He wanted to know if I had any of Peter's files, anything he left behind. And? I told him he never kept anything here. Right. Hey. Hello. Are you guys going somewhere? Yeah, to stay in the country with my mother. I just can't stand it here. Will you keep looking? Juliana, are you sure you want me to find out the details? That won't change anything, will it? I want the truth, Daniel. Kathryn deserves that... and so do I. Okay. I'll keep looking. Okay. Anti-war demonstrators expanded their angry protests to new cities throughout the world. Large crowds gathered to picket in front of U.S. and North Korean embassies, as the clock ticks down on the United States' threat of military action against North Korea. As we've reported, the Washington administration gave the Korean dictator the November 15th deadline to stop all ballistic missile and nuclear weapons testing or face prompt and aggressive military action. Today in New York, just 12 days from that deadline, Vice president Asteron again lobbied the United Nations for support. Joining us live here on UBN from his office in Washington is the vice president's chief of staff, Matthew McBride. Welcome, Mr. McBride. "Grave peril" is how the vice president describes the threat of war with North Korea. Is that election year posturing, or does the administration really believe that we are on the brink of war? Alice, the president has dispatched four major carrier groups to the Sea of Japan and the gulf of West Korea. I would take that as a sign that the United States means business. But the United Nations is split almost directly down the middle, some charging, in fact, that the administration is instigating the conflict. How do you react to that? It's nonsense. The North Koreans have brought this on themselves, and now there is no more negotiating. If other countries do not get behind the November 15th deadline, then this administration stands ready to take unilateral action. We will not waver. Punch in. Pushing in on camera 2. W-H tip. 12 Lou Cox. Bring the sample to S De la Strada." What the hell is this? Are you there yet? Yeah. Pulling up now. This is no longer a surveillance operation. I want you to eliminate the target... and mop up. Got it? Copy. Hey! Go! Go! Perd?n. Sorry. Sorry. Rattori, he's going up to the roof. We have a runner on the roof. G-6, 406. Get me an eye in the sky. On it. Requesting coverage for lat 41.3821. Long 2.180909, acquisition priority alpha. Okay, Natas. I've got a Misty with coverage for the next 10 minutes. Setting up a Mill Star relay... now. Get a lock on his cell phone. Run all you want, Kovaks. Split up! We have a visual. He's on the Ramblas, heading north, fast. He's approximately 500 feet in front of you. Fuck! Got you. My God. What is going on? What's happening? We've got a man down. Where is he? I repeat, man down. Shit! Shit! Fuck! Where is he? Come on! Where is he? Tell me where he is. All right. Working on it. He's headed west on... on Pelayo. Pelayo. Pelayo, now! Let's go! Pelayo. It seems like he's getting tired. You're gaining on him. Where the fuck is he? Give me something! Where is he? Hold on. There's something wrong. It says that... he's headed toward you. He's right in front of you! He's underground. He's in the metro. Okay, he's just south of you. Hey! Accuracy becoming marginal. The signal is weak. Keep going straight ahead. Approximately 300 feet. Okay, take the back, I'll take the front, meet in the middle. It seems the target has stopped moving. Okay. He's directly between the both of you. Gotcha. 100 feet. 50 feet. 25 feet. You should be right on top of him! Fuck! Fuck! Shit. We lost him. All right, Mr. Kovaks. All right. Don't think we need the big guns for this one, Agent Rattori. Well, yeah, you know me. Always like to help out the little fellows. What do we have here, my old friend? Well, at first glance, random murder. The victim is a Maria Infante, 27. No priors, no history. But whoever did this left a sloppy trail. Dirt prints led us to look at the apartment downstairs. And who does it belong to? Peter Kovaks. The reporter killed at the Medina. An eyewitness saw his brother flee the scene. Okay. Issue an alert for the brother. Bring him in. Suspicion of murder. As of now, I'm officially taking this over. "Sample." What sample? The bill? De la Strada. That is a very rare set of Deutschmarks. It is one of my most prized possessions. It's interesting. I'm very sorry to hear about your brother. Thank you. I think the people who killed Peter are after me now. The news reports said that the man who killed Peter committed suicide. Well, you can't always believe what the news reports say now, can you? Sit down. Peter... Peter talked to you about his story, right? The sample? Yes. Yes, I... I didn't want to offer that unless you asked. You know, for your own safety. This is what Peter asked me about. "PN-14342"? The stuff of kings. Of rogue countries. Of bad men doing very bad things. See the circles? They mark imperfections in various incarnations of PN-14342. On page one, there are many on a version of the bill they named the Supernote. Now turn to the last page, the one I call the Megabill. The Megabill. Nearly perfect. Do you realize what an accomplishment that is? So PN-14342 is a counterfeit? Yes. A beautiful family of counterfeits. And now the latest version of PN-14342 is good enough to fool every bank in the world. Printed on identical paper on Intaglio presses and with optically visual ink, like real American currency. How many of these Megabills have you seen? Many. Every time the U.S. Secret Service found them. So the story goes that they shipped them off to Washington and burned them. But then too many started turning up, and they couldn't keep it quiet. Would you be able to recognize one if you saw it? What do you think? Nothing unusual at first glance. Micro-printing around ol' Ben Franklin... Polymer threads. Blue and red fabric. Light shifting ink. Yes. All there. It boggles the mind to think of all the care this took to make, all to be foiled by a flat-bottom G. In the word "legal." Flat-bottom G? See there? The very bottom of the G is not round. This printing flaw is the only feature making this bill different from real legal tender. So that is a Megabill. Yes. That's the Megabill. Do you have more of those? I really don't wanna say, but I thank you very much for your expertise. My brother thanks you as well. Thank you very much. Mr. Kovaks... if you find more of those, I'd be happy to authenticate them for you. Okay. Thank you very much. Protestors came out in force today in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and over 40 new cities worldwide. Demonstrators are protesting Kim Jong Il's refusal to acknowledge the November 15th deadline to stop nuclear bomb testing. With the deadline only ten days away and the North Koreans continuing to push back, Like I said, he's here. Military action seems inevitable. Yeah, I got your e-mail about the Megabill, and I've come up with some pretty interesting stuff. Now, do you mind telling me what's going on, Dan? You're all over the news. They're saying that you murdered some woman in your brother's building. No, I didn't... My God, these guys are serious. You've really outdone yourself this time. How did you know I'd be here? I knew if you needed help, you'd eventually come to Ludovic. I'm sorry about your brother. Thanks. I'm gonna figure this out. I'm glad you're here. Here's what we've got. Kim Jong Il. Guy's been all over the news lately. "First came Adolf Hitler and his secret campaign, Operation Bernhard, during World War II to flood the British and American economies with... counterfeit cash." "Now according to State Department and Secret Service sources, it's North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il with a master plan all his own. After years of producing near-perfect fakes of the old design of American money, intelligence sources say Kim Jong Il and his master forgers have honed the art of the fake and are now making mass quantities of near-perfect copies of American currency. These have been nicknamed by some, the Megabills." Check this out. A Megabill? Absolutely. So you think North Koreans killed Peter? I don't know. Look, Alex, maybe you should get out of here. This is getting way too dangerous. No, Dan, I'm in. Guys... Guys, you both better get out of here. How the hell... Your cell phone. Give me your cell phone. They can triangulate your position. Now they're probably looking for you. Give it to me. I know how to block the signal. Take the back. Let's go. Polic?a! Get in! Who's he? He's a cop. Good cop or bad cop? That's a good question. I'm Oro, Barcelona Police. Why are you doing this? Santos Rattori with Spanish Secret Service has taken over the investigation from my department. Wait a minute. You told me that my brother was with a bunch of small-timers in that hotel. What is Spanish Secret Service doing involved? I don't know. I thought I could trust Rattori. Now he's taking his lead from someone higher up. Where are you taking us? Last I checked, out of danger. Why don't I just turn myself in? Because you'll either be falsely charged with murder or killed in custody. Like those options? Notice anything strange about the bullet? It's from the Medina Royal crime scene. Looks normal to me. This one was fired through a silencer. Know why that bothers me? Who commits suicide with a silencer? Or no silencer was found at the crime scene. Correct on both counts. Could the killers be North Korean? What do you know? Tell me what you know. Go. Go. Increasing perimeter to ten miles. Where are you, Kovaks? Where are we going? Looks like, France. There is it. Come on, go. But we'll get the next one. No. We get this one right now, okay? We'll lay low for a little while. I'll work my contacts from here. H-Hey! You son of a bitch! Too dangerous, Alex. If I disappear, go to the U.S. Embassy and tell them what we've learned so far. I'll make you disappear, you bastard! Barcelona base. Is this a secure line? Go ahead. I'm concerned about your public display of force. It'll be dismissed as acts of random violence. It needs to be. And the shipment? Last shipment arrived safely, and the bird is returning home. Stay on schedule. Have you found the missing package? No. Still working on that. Yeah, good boy. You've been a good boy today. Yeah, you've been a very good boy. Mr. Kovaks. Sorry to startle you. Come inside. You look like you could use a place to rest. No. I just need to ask you a few questions, if I may. Are the North Koreans the counterfeiters? Yes. The North Koreans are the proud parents of PN-14342. How do you know? Because, my dear boy, I'm one of the few experts in the world who can detect the Megabill, so agencies routinely hire me to track its route into the currency stream. All paths lead to the Korean peninsula. Could you give me just a brief history? Come inside. No, no, please. Just tell me. In 1989, Supernote counterfeits started turning up in banks around the world. The fakes were good, but far from perfect. But no one in intelligence could figure out who was making them. That changed in 1997. What happened then? Two defectors. One, the former secretary of the Korean Workers' Party sought asylum at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. They eventually told about a pet project of Kim Jong Il's: counterfeiting large quantities of American money. Is any of this documented? I was there. A U.S. agency brought me in to speak to the Workers' Party defector. Which agency brought you in? The CIA. How many counterfeits have the Koreans made? The amount is in the billions of dollars. That could cause a lot of damage. Is doing. The other defector said that Kim Jong Il is using the funny money to prop up his nuclear weapons program. In fact, the intelligence community thinks he used the counterfeits to fund those underground atomic bomb tests in 2006. Yes, this is very serious business, Mr. Kovaks. Clearly. It cost my brother his life. All paths lead to the Korean peninsula. An American trespassing on North Korean interests. How familiar. Sorry. Must have taken a wrong turn at Burma. Kovaks. I recognize that name. Maybe you're confusing me with my brother. He was murdered at the Medina Royal Hotel. Maybe you read about it. Maybe you were there. We're accustomed to this. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is accused of many things by its imperialistic enemies. They call us terrorists. Well, if it walks like a duck, and it talks like a duck... But we do know about revolution that cuts humanity into pieces in order to rejuvenate it, like our undying quest to reunite our people. For that, we never, ever hesitate to do what we must. But I do know what it's like to lose a brother. I lost two myself. And I, too, would do anything to preserve their memories. This is why I'm going to let you go... and continue your search. But do not come back. Do you understand? Alejandra, good to see you. Agent Denfri. It's been a lifetime. How are you? Come on. Hasn't been that long. Welcome to our little surveillance party. Chicos, meet Alejandra Velor. Hi. Hola. Who are you watching? Standard lot. Spies disguised as diplomats. Did you find out anything for me? The identities of the men killed with Kovaks. Great. Three of the men were freelance bodyguards. Obviously not very good. They were protecting this guy, Newton Suliman. Small-timer from Cyprus with links to organized crime. Mostly a stolen goods merchant. He and this man, Goulos Haque, were almost always together. But he wasn't one of the victims. Was he picked up on security cameras at the hotel? They went down right before the shooting. That's convenient. Exactly. But while the doorman and other people at the Medina couldn't identify all the victims from pictures, no one said they saw Goulos Haque that day. Any idea where he is? Barcelona police went to his apartment and reported it looks like he left in a panic. He raced off in his car toward Valencia. How do they know that? He was stopped for speeding 20 kilometers from Valencia. Of course, the cop who stopped him just gave him a citation and let him go. The bodies hadn't been discovered at this point. Valencia. The docks? Yeah, could be. So Haque's the missing link. But what does he know? There's something else you should be aware of. A top-level agent of Interpol has taken over the investigation from Barcelona P.D. Rattori. I know. Rattori's working for a man named Natas. He's getting a lot of support. Mainly a blind eye, if you know what I mean. Who's Natas working for? Someone big, but I couldn't find out who. Thank you, Alfonso. Can I have these pictures? Be careful, Alejandra. This might be bigger than you think. In clear defiance of the United States' warnings, word is coming in tonight that North Korea has conducted yet another ballistic missile test in the Sea of Japan, further escalating tensions, all as American naval power speeds to the area. I knew you'd come back here. Hey. How was France? Fine, for the five minutes I was there, cabr?n. Are we safe here? Are we safe anywhere? Ludovic said that the police haven't been back here since... What's the matter? I'm just really sore. It's a long story. I met with my contact, and he told me that the lead guy who died with Peter was a stolen goods smuggler, but clearly small time. And his partner, a Goulos Haque, he's missing. Probably took his car and himself and escaped on a freighter out of Valencia. To where? I don't know. My friend is checking, but... you know what I am thinking? Yeah. We find this Haque character, and we find the missing piece. Hey, guys, I managed to pull some video off that chip you gave me. Come check it out. Come on. Baggage handlers? That's Goulos Haque. That's Suliman, the man who died with Peter. American Relief Services... in Barcelona Harbor? Audio notes from surveillance shoot number 6. My God. Friday evening, 10 p.m. Barcelona Harbor. Peter. It appears as though Suliman and Haque are not counterfeit traders as they claim, but common crooks. They must have gotten lucky one day and stolen a crate full of phony cash. But who did they steal it from? A bank? Counterfeiters? Finding out is my next to-do. Couldn't get inside of 401A, but I'll try again after I meet with Suliman as a buyer in two days at the Medina Hotel. They're selling a lot of cash, ten cents on the dollar. So, now what? We finish what my brother started. We go to 401A. I knew you'd say that. Here. Before I forget. In case of an emergency. I opened it using a false I.D. It'll take them weeks to figure it out. I don't suppose you have a key. Okay. You wait here. Yeah, okay. Call out if you see anybody, okay? Okay. Holy shit. Natas! We got motion sensors going off at the warehouse. Anyone supposed to be out there? No. Punch up camera three. There. Zoom in on that. Call security. Dan! Dan! Corre. Corre. Run, run, run! Go, go! Get in! Can we meet somewhere? I don't think it's safe to meet out in the open. Come here. All right, fine. And, Dan... trust no one, do you hear me? I don't trust anybody. I'm so relieved you are all right. Have you ever heard of American Relief Services? Humanitarian group? I read in the newspaper that their European headquarters is here. Well, we found a ripped piece of a bill in one of their warehouses. Can you take a look at it? I can tell you without question it's part of a Megabill. Don't you have to examine it first? No movements! What are you doing? You're finally going to meet the people who've been after you. They're coming now. When you call, I call. Worked out nicely. What's your end? It's always about money. In my case, that has double meaning. Something very titillating... about being part of something so sinister and so perfect. I also get paid real money to verify the fakes for my friends. I like to think they moved here because I'm so valuable to them. Valuable? You're pathetic. Not unlike your brother. My brother? The intoxicating power of my Megabills. The dreams they inspire. What are you talking about? Peter might have started out doing a grand story about something that would change the world, but he proved too human for his ideals. Make sense. Your brother was intending to buy the Megabills from Suliman for himself! Ten cents on the dollar, with the goal to get immediately ten times his money in Megabills and do whatever you do with ill-found gains. I don't believe it. Believe it! Check his bank account for a large withdrawal prior to the shooting. And everyone thought you were the morally challenged brother! Right. Go, go, go! Let's go! Do you believe his story about Peter? I don't know. I don't know. I mean, as much as Peter and I didn't get along, I always thought of him as... Perfect? No. No, not perfect, but certainly a lot closer to it than me. I don't know. Maybe he saw it as an opportunity to make some easy money and figured nobody'd miss it. Juliana said the story was somehow different. Different? How? I don't... I don't know. Goddamn it! Where were you? I held them off as long as I could! Where'd they go? In a car. How the hell should I know? Go track him down. We're gonna need someone to clean this up. "W.H. Tip." "W.H. Tip"? "2 12 Lou Cox." Two, one, two. 212. An area code. That would be New York. Could it be that easy? Maybe. Peter always codes his information to protect it from people. I've done enough ride-alongs with NYPD to know that they call lieutenants "Lou." What? Miller. Hey, yo, it's Dan. You're not calling to back out of my party, are you? Listen, I need your help. This is very important, okay? Sure thing. What is it? I'm trying to track down an NYPD lieutenant named Cox. If he's collecting benefits, he'll be listed in the metro roster. Look for somebody with some other service record: military, FBI, something like that. Yeah, okay, I got one here. Lieutenant Michael Cox. After he left NYPD, he served as head of audio-visual security for the Secret Service at the White House. The White House? What administration? Current one. Son of a bitch. White House. "W.H." has gotta be "White House." Okay, so Peter must have gotten a tip from somebody at the White House about Lou Cox. Michael Cox has gotta be our man, okay? Can you track him down? Where is he located right now? Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. Got killed in a car accident last year. Son of a... You know what? It figures. Does he have any family? Yeah. Wife, Lynn Cox. Lives in Mattituck on the Island. All right, listen. buddy. I need you to pay her a visit. What? Why? Ask her if she knows anything about PN-14342, also known as the Megabill. Tell her that a lot of people died trying to find out something that her husband either knew or saw. Okay, wait. PN? PN-14342. It's very important. Write it down, man. Okay. I'll do what I can. Thanks, brother. Yeah, yeah. Now we got something. Who are you calling now? Oro speaking. It's Dan Kovaks. You're still alive? I'm impressed. I don't know how long I can keep that up. Sir, I've got an incoming call for Inspector Daniel Oro. There's a company called American Relief Services running out of the Barcelona Harbor. I need you to find out who's behind them. What is this nonsense? Believe me... it's connected to the murder, and it's very important, okay? Okay, I'll check it out. Where are you now? Yeah. We got him, sir. I would say you should be heading to an airport or a train station, but it's too late for that. Rattori has assigned men to all exit points. They're not gonna let you out. Meet me at the Plaza Espa?a in an hour. Good. Kovaks. I found out who runs American Relief Services. It's run by this guy. It's the same guy who's been controlling the agent from Spanish Secret Service. His name is Calvert Natas. He's an American operating out of the U.S. Consulate. Natas? American? Who does he work for? CIA. How do you know? If I was there, I'd shoot you myself. Let me remind you that nothing is traceable. Really? So where are they? I'm working on that. I have a man on the ground tracking them as we speak. End this, Natas. Whatever you have to do. Kill them and get the fuck out of there! We got him, sir. Headed north on Avenue Diaganal towards Pau Claris. Okay. Where the hell are we going? Another country. What? We're hundreds of miles from any border. Welcome to another country. Come on. What? I know somebody here. Come on. Don't worry about it. Embassy is territory of home country, you know? No one can touch. No, no. You cannot come in here! We're not gonna move. Okay, listen. My name is Daniel Kovaks, okay? This is Alejandra Velor. We're here to seek political asylum. We are investigative reporters. We're in possession of state secrets of the U.S. government. We are gonna be killed. We need political asylum. So, Mr. Kovaks, it seems you didn't take our warning very seriously the last time you were here. But do not come back, do you understand? Last time? The guy I spoke to last time let me go. He said that I could continue my search, okay? Please, can I answer that? That could be very important, okay? That could be the information that your superiors are waiting for. Now, you wouldn't wanna disappoint your superiors, would you? Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, hey, it's me. I just got back. I got something for you. I went to see Lynn Cox in Mattituck like you asked. As soon as I mentioned PN-14342, she started to freak. Then she gives me this DVD. Says her husband told her... to give it to anyone with a badge who wasn't CIA. What's your e-mail address here? Please, I need your e-mail address. Woman's terrified, Dan. She couldn't wait to give it to me. Hey, what's on it? For all I know, naked pictures of Mrs. Cox. Don't know. Didn't have time to look. Did you want me to e-mail it to you, asap? Yes. Yes, please. Compress the file Wait. North Korean Consulate? What the hell's going on, Dan? Just send it to me, okay? Please? Thank you. Okay. We're in business. Someone wants to see you. You'll be proud to meet the honorable Consul General to Spain from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Chang Choi. The Consul General? Well, I... I continued my search, and I found out some things, and now I need your help, sir. Yes, I know. And I need yours. Mine? Yes. An e-mail just arrived for you. How did you get this? I got it from a friend. And this is? Matthew McBride, the vice president's chief of staff. Hello, my friend. Calvert Natas. You know him? Did you see me on the TV today? Always said you should be the guy with the title. Could you pause that? Can you stop that? Calvert Natas runs American Relief Services out of the Barcelona Harbor. He's CIA. And he is the one who's responsible for shipping those super counterfeit Megabills that your country makes. Wait. If we're to get along, there's one thing you must understand. Our official position is that these bills exist, but we are being blamed without any evidence. Okay, so let's just say then that, hypothetically, Country X is involved in manufacturing these bills. What would Calvert Natas be doing with them? Hypothetically? Of course. If a country... were producing large quantities of counterfeits, they would do anything they could to get them into the currency system... discreetly. Now, what we've been hearing about these bills is that they are showing up in unusually large numbers in Southeast Asia. Someone, not the manufacturer, is collecting the bills and placing them there. Watch. How many Megabills have come in? 90 million last month. 85 the month before. Kim Jong has been busy. Yeah. And Secret Service still thinks we're burning all the ones we confiscate. Look, our Malaysian friends, they're turning up the heat. They want more bills to keep the contributions coming back to our little fund. Okay, so Natas and McBride have got themselves a sweet little deal. They take all the bills that the Secret Service finds in circulation... And instead of burning them, they ship them to Malaysia. And then in return, Malaysia launders the money and then gives them a nice little portion back to stick in their little fund. I doubt that fund goes to UNICEF. No. It probably goes for covert operations, Asteron's political campaigns. Who knows? Okay, so everything was moving along just fine until a shipment of those bills got stolen. Imagine the heat that came down when they found out that a reporter was trying to buy some of those bills. That reporter was my brother. Okay, those Megabills, they're still out there, okay? So these guys probably went into crisis mode, and they shut down every aspect of their operation. And then they started to eliminate everybody who knew anything about the counterfeits. Now probably including the people, or the country, responsible for manufacturing them. Wait, wait. Are you saying that Natas and McBride are willing to start a war to cover up their involvement in counterfeit bills? Does that really surprise you? Wars have been started on a lot less than that. I understand. Trust me. That's one hell of a story. Yeah, it is. But I'm not gonna tell it. What? I'm not gonna tell the story unless I can tell the story. The whole story. The truth, warts and all. Impossible. Okay, well, then you'll have to release us back to the Spanish police, and we'll disappear along with the story. And then November 15th is gonna roll around, and our countries will fight the nuclear fight, and then, believe me, you'll lose all hope of ever reunifying your country, whatever's left of it. No. Look, I'm a fair journalist, okay? I'll tell both sides of the story. You can issue any denial, spin, whatever your position is. I'll have to talk to the premier. Of course. In the meanwhile, what do you need? I need to call some friends. What's the name of the ship? The Riccardi? We need 15 minutes for a special report over the whole network. I promise it'll be worth it. Okay, thank you. Okay. Denfri says that Haque and his car were on a ship out of Valencia called the S.S. Riccardi. It docked in Newark last night. Last night? Damn it! He's long gone. No, no, no. Not if he has to clear customs. Right. What's up with the network? We're good? Okay, UBN is offering time on their network and affiliates. But it's a narrow window. If we miss it, we're done. Let's get going. Hey, hey! I'm a guest of the consulate. I'm a guest of the consulate! Leave me alone, man! I'm a guest of the consulate. This is Anna Michaels reporting on a breaking news story at the North Korean Consulate in Barcelona, Spain. Apparently an American television team is requesting asylum from the North Korean authorities. Details aren't clear, but it seems that the American reporter and producer are preparing to broadcast from inside the consulate. More information to come as the story unfolds. Now, here's Sharon Edwards... Miller. One more favor, buddy. This time I'm gonna make you a hero. Did anyone ever tell you you're a goddamn pest? Listen, I need you to arrest a man named Goulos Haque. H-A-Q-U-E. He should be waiting to pick up a shipment from the S.S. Riccardi, which docked in Newark last night. I just e-mailed you his rap sheet and some photos. What's he carrying? Most likely... very important missing counterfeit money. This is big time, buddy. Call me when you catch him. I gotta go. Call me when you catch him. Audio notes from surveillance shoot number 6. Friday evening, 10 p.m. Barcelona Harbor. What do I say about Peter? Say what your heart tells you. I can't lie. You don't have enough evidence either way. Don't report it unless you're sure. Some wise reporter once told me. And who was that? Some guy with a faulty off switch. Alex... thank you. It's not over yet. There is a way to stop them. The network truck needs a clean line of sight to the building in order to get a signal. Do you understand? Break the line of sight. Beautiful. That's beautiful. Excuse me. Move all of these trucks out of here. Who are you? Interpol? Move them. Okay. Are you getting our signal, New York? Great. We wanna run a few rehearsals, and we'll be ready in a couple minutes, okay? Thank you. We are not moving. Move it, or I'll tow it away. At the center of this report, perhaps most shocking of all, is a conspiracy by the vice president's chief of staff, Matthew McBride, and... How tight are we? Like here? All right. Hey, we've lost the signal. What? Okay. Bring me on camera six. Camera six. Got it. Rattori, you copy? Copy. Okay, I hacked into their security system and looped cameras five and six. You're invisible now. Okay, wait for my signal. Wait there. Wait there. Now. Go. Hello. What? What? Shit. They're moving the trucks. What do we do? Don't worry, New York. We're working on it. What are we gonna do? Tell me I'm a good producer. What? Tell me I'm a good producer. You're a good producer. Now what? Come here. Recognize anyone? Ludovic.... Nice one. After we got the okay last night, I called him just in case. You're a great producer. The only problem is that as soon as he puts his mast up, the police will see him. How is he gonna get his signal to the UBN truck? Yeah, okay, okay. This is the plan. Radio the UBN guys to bring microwave repeaters to a roof just southwest of here. We can use Ludovic to relay the signal to the roof and then they can uplink it to the satellite, okay? So it's a relay race. I'll call Ludovic. If we have to bounce this signal all the way to New York, that's what we'll do. Looks like your little show is finally over. Wait! The premiere ordered us to release you to the local authorities within the hour. No, no, no. We need more time than that. That's not enough time. We need more time. Top of the hour. I can do no more. This camera's history, man. Can we broadcast, or can you fix it? Should we pack up and make a run for it? No! Where are we gonna go? We have no place to go. We've gotta figure out something. Do we have another camera? A cell phone? I believe... this belongs to you. My camera. Make this work. I'm on it. Good to go. Perfect. Hail Mary, full of grace, please work. Switching channel 6, QPSK modulation. Channel 6, QPSK. Roger. Come on out wherever you are. I can see you. Hah! Gotcha! Get ready, boys. It's coming your way. Roof to relay, beam relayed to satellite. It's working. Good. Showtime. Master control, we're ready to go live. I'm being told our feed from Barcelona has been reestablished. We go now to Dan Kovaks... a freelance reporter who is currently a political refugee 9, 8, 7, 6... in, of all places, the North Korean Consulate. 5, 4... Dan? Dan, can you hear me? Thank you, Alice. That's Uncle Dan! Yeah. In a few moments, the Spanish authorities are going to place myself, my producer and my entire crew under arrest. While the charges that are being brought against us are completely fraudulent, we are being falsely accused in order to prevent us from bringing you this story. The story... it's a story that begins with a tale of international counterfeiting allegedly by the North Korean government. Yes, the same government from which we now broadcast. This video was shot by my brother while investigating two small-time criminals as they steal a shipment of counterfeit bills. It appears as though Suliman and Haque are not counterfeit traders as they claimed, but common crooks robbing boats and warehouses of cargo. They must have gotten lucky one day and stolen a crate full of phony cash. But who did they steal it from? A bank? Counterfeiters? They're selling a lot of cash, ten cents on the dollar. Now, for their part, the North Koreans vehemently deny any involvement whatsoever in counterfeiting, and they are allowing me to broadcast for what they claim is a sincere wish to prevent nuclear war. At the center of this report, and perhaps the most shocking, is a conspiracy by vice presidential chief of staff Matthew McBride and elements within the CIA to use this counterfeit money for political gain. How many Megabills have come in? 90 million last month, 85 the month before. Kim Jong has been busy. Yeah. And Secret Service still thinks we're burning all the ones we confiscate. Fools. This conspiracy raises some very serious and troubling questions. How many people have died because of Matthew McBride's complicity in this conspiracy? And how high up does this conspiracy go? Does it stop at the vice-presidential office or does it continue all the way up to the president himself? And finally, how many more lives will be lost if the November 15th deadline leads to military action? Will we be going to war to serve the needs of the free world... or for the greed of a few men? And on a personal note... I want to thank my brother, Peter Kovaks, who gave his life for this story. He was an outstanding journalist and father and husband. I also want to thank Alejandra Velor, my producer, who risked everything to be here. She means everything to me. It's been 48 hours since the incident at the North Korean Consulate in Barcelona, Spain. And at this time, the story continues to unfold. In the U.S., the vice president's chief of staff Matthew McBride is now under arrest and being held in an undisclosed federal prison. He's charged with first-degree murder and treason. A special prosecutor has been appointed to investigate whether the vice president or possibly even the president himself knew of the Megabill conspiracy. Longtime criminal Goulas Haque, a Dutch national, has also been arrested in New York Harbor. He was in possession of what authorities presume to be the missing Megabill counterfeits. Calvert Natas, a former CIA operative and Mathew McBride's main co-conspirator is reportedly missing. A worldwide search for Natas is currently underway. Meanwhile, in the Sea of Japan, the U.S. naval force has been ordered to stand down and return to bases in Asia. So it seems that, for now, the United States and North Korea have stepped back from the brink of war. As for Dan Kovaks and Alejandra Velor, members of the press have yet to be allowed to speak to the courageous journalists about their remarkable discovery. The silence has sparked widespread rumors about their fate. The North Koreans vehemently deny any wrongdoing and claim absolutely no involvement in counterfeiting or criminal activity of any kind.
