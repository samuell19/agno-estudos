Noah picture presents Yehoram Gaon A film by Menachem Golan Kazablan The sea of Jaffa. Also known as the Mediterranean Sea. This is the sea where the whale came, opened his mouth, and Jonah the prophet met his Creator. This sea brought the Crusaders, the Turks, Herzel and myself. Moshiko Babiov, the Jaffa tisherman. Jaffa. So much mud. So much dust. So what? Wouldn't we have walked 40 years in the desert to get here? We suffered a lot. A lot. We rolled about on tiny boats in the stormy sea. We suffered a lot. A lot. But we came. And now that we're here, praise God, we want to rest a bit. Sit peacefully. We're all tired trom traveling here. But ot course, they won't let us. They won't let us rest. There are problems from outside. There are problems from within. Do we finally have a state? Yes. Is there a government? Yes. Is there work? No. Here. Good morning. Here are the hooligans. Casa and his gang of bastards. Cockadoodledoo! Every morning they come to make our lives even sorrier. Every night they drink at Madame Rosa's club. Morning comes, and they decide to raise havoc in the neighborhood. May your house burn down! Hey, Moshiko! -Attention everyone! This neighborhood has been designated tor destruction. I repeat. This neighborhood has been designated tor destruction. Whoever is in their smelly beds has less than a minute and a half. It'll mean big trouble tor him, his mother and his grandmother! Go choke and die! -Hello, Mariuma! May God punish you with the plague and may your first born die! Moshiko! -Yes? Why don't you say something? -What can I do? Yell! That's what you call yelling? -Hoodlums! What's going on? -Quiet, please! Have you gone mad? Hooligans! Rascals! You won't let people sleep! What nerve! It's 5 am! I want to sleep. -Hello, Madame Butterfly. They're hooligans! -You rats! Good morning, Panny Feldman. Everyone's awake. We have a minion. Where's your nice daughter? There she is. -Get inside. Get inside. Hi. Good morning, Rachela. Don't I get a "good morning"? Do you always wake up looking as sour as a lemon grove? Let me see your face. Partly cloudy, but looking good. So what about my "good morning"? What do you want? -To marry your daughter. That's what he wants. Shut up. -Get out of here, you rats. Where to, Mr. Feldman? Where should we go? Maybe you forgot, Mr. Feldman, but I live here, too. In this fashionable neighborhood. Mr. Feldman... Get inside, now. Get inside! Why? -She's not for someone like you. What am I like? Moroccan? Moroccan, Mr. Feldman? -I didn't say that. So your little Polish Princess isn't for a dark skinned guy, eh? Ambulance! Quickly! -Niko, what's wrong? Sarina, nazda kupilu! -Kupilu! What's happened, Moshiko? -Sarina kupilu! She has contractions every 10 minutes. Ambulance! Ambulance! -Ambulance! What's wrong? You again? Damn it! As soon as I find my pants I'll beat the hell out of you! You'd better send your wife first! Simon, what's going on? -See for yourself. Adio santo... -Adio santo! What's going on? These hooligans again? Hey! Shoemaker's here. -You should be kicked out of the neighborhood. No kidding! You haven't been beaten in a while. Where have you been? Criminal! Your place is in prison! He's right. -Mr. Feldman... Mr. Feldman, listen. I'm not moving from here until your nice daughter says "good morning" to me. How about that? -Shame on you! You came here with all your hoodlums to wake all the neighbors. You don't have any self respect. Respect? He's never heard of it. You.. -Say it. Say it. Criminal. Rascal. Say it. -Rascal. I'm glad you know what you are. Mania, get inside. Get inside! Get inside! Don't listen to him, Casa. Moshiko. -What? -Don't I have respect? Of course you have respect. The only thing is, you're not a man. In Casablanca we used to give a man respect even if he wasn't a man. "At noon in the casba when the market was open, "I used to strut around with my chest out. "Everyone said what a guy is walking down the street, "They'd wave from every window, out of respect. "Back then, everyone knew "Who gets the most respect. "Back then, everyone knew "Who gets the most respect. "And when the battle began and the unit wouldn't move, "The commander would say 'You're first, Casa!' "Everyone knew that Casablan always marched first, "And in back they'd yell: 'He's got respect'. "Back then, everyone knew "Who gets the most respect. "Back then, everyone knew "Who gets the most respect. "Some guy walks with a girl in Jaffa in the evening. "If I wanted I could have her in my arms. "But I won't bother the guy, I won't make him shake. "for me it's a matter of principle. I have respect. "Back then, everyone knew "Who gets the most respect. "Back then, everyone knew "Who gets the most respect. "If a drunkard walks into the bar I settle him down. "I'll throw him all the way to the next town. "But later he'll come back much meeker. "He'll lift a glass and toast me: 'Much respect'. "Back then, everyone knew "Who gets the most respect. "Back then, everyone knew "Who gets the most respect. "Back then, everyone knew "Who gets the most respect. "Back then, everyone knew "Who gets the most respect." I do! Who called for an ambulance? Mariuma. -Mariuma! Mariuma, they're here from the hospital. -Bring the mother. I heard you! I heard you! Quickly! Why are you standing? Run! Come. Come, madame. The ambulance is waiting here. It's not for me! Slowly. Slowly. Slowly, slowly. Careful. -Careful. Careful. I'm going to die. -Wait! Wait! You're going without a word? Bring back what I told you. Moshiko, whatever the good lord gives we shall take. -Amen. Be it a boy or a girl. As long as there's a briss. Careful on the steps. Niko, take off your shirt. -There's plenty of time. Why take off my shirt? -Take it off. Put it on her back for good luck. Wait! Wait! -I'm about to give birth! Not yet. Not yet. Sarina, put this round your neck and spit 3 times. Go on, mama. What is this, Mrs. Nasimov? It's a stewed rabbit's eye. Move aside. Stop spitting on me. Quickly. -Lean on me. Congratulations. I hope it's a boy. May it be a boy. -But may he be a kosher Jew. Kosher, not kosher. As long as he can use his fists. Mr. Babiov, what are all these things good for? The rabbit's eye and the husband's shirt? It's an ancient Kurdish tradition. It works against labor pains. It sounds crazy to me. Everyone's crazy in their own way. One big melting pot. "When the Lord scattered his people, "Amongst the children of Esau and those of Ishmail, "He gave them all the Sabbath and holidays, "But forgot to give them the same customs. "That's how life is. Lite is a market. "Here are magic carpets, There are genies in bottles. "Here enemies can be bought. There friends are sold out. "But the money sticks with the Jews. "Blue ballons, to the adults and the young. "A carrot is good for the eye sight. "Cheese is excellent for you. "Vegetables, vegetables. Antiques, antiques. "We're all Jews and so nice, too. "Jews, a hundred percent. "Whether Sephardic or Ashkenaz. "We all have the same father, "From Romania, Algeria or Kfar Saba. "And when there is trouble and pain, "We all understand one another. "And all of Israel, all of Israel are friends. "Sir, come see what wonderful goods. "It's strong as iron. It won't ever rip. "If it's not good, sir, "your money back. "Or you better say your prayers. "You're an ass. -You're stupid. "You're a scoundrel. -You're a thief. "You're a cheat. -You're down low. "You're a pig. -You're an idiot. You're despicable. -What kind of a Jew is this? "What kind of a Jew is this? "We're all Jews and so nice, too. "Jews, a hundred percent. "Whether Sephardic or Ashkenaz. "We all have the same father, "From Romania, Algeria or Kfar Saba.

Good morning, Rachel. I'm so glad you came to the store. What can I do for you? Come, sit down, Rachel. What? -Look at these soles. I bought them from you only 2 weeks ago. Well, Yanush's delicate designs are not fit for the pitiful alleys of Jaffa. Why don't you move to Tel Aviv? Because you live in Jaffa and not in Tel Aviv, eh? Wait, what are you? You wear a size 63, right? I'm not here to buy. I just want you to tix my soles. You don't have to buy, Rachel. It's free. from Yanush, with love. Yanush, you're mad. It's a mad world. What can you do? You still haven't told me "good morning". No, eh? Just once. "Good morning". Cucumbers! Cucumbers! Sweet potatoes! Baklava! Hot pita bread! I'm still waiting. I'm stubborn. What can I do? I hope she says good morning betore the police have to come. Look at his face. He could kill for one "good morning". That murderer. Baklawa! Baklawa! Let her go. You really scared me, Mr. Gulash. Nisim! Ariel! I'm warning you, Simantov. -Good mornining, Rachel. I said good morning. Good morning, Mr. Yosef Simantov. -My friends call me Casablan. Or Casa. Whichever they prefer. Casablan... The landlord is crazy! What do you want from us? You should be sitting in jail with other criminals. Go! Get out! Go to your panthers! There you can be a big hero. Tomatoes! He doesn't have a home. He's like an animal. "There's a place past the sea. "Where the sand is white, and home is warm. "Where the sun shines above, "Over the market, the street and the port. "Home is past the sea. "I remember the candle burning on the Sabbath "And my father looking at me in silence. "It's a far place. A wonderful place. "In every window you can hear a prayer. "A mother and daughter in the courtyard. "Baking bread in the oven. "Home is past the sea. "I won't forget my fathers eyes. "How he looked, Looked East. It's a place which is still far. "Without Sabbath songs, prayer and laughter. "Narrow alleys near a huge sea. "And empty houses crying silently. "My heart's still there, past the sea. "I hear a prayer from an empty house. "There is a place that's still far away. "Anywhere I run, "There'll be a place I can't forget. "I'll always have it in my heart. "There's a place I'll always love." They're here again. The municipalities. Attention! On all the doors! No exceptions! Move it! Sir, what is the meaning of this? Sir, what is this? What? What is this? Why are you standing? Go call the police. Where can I find a phone? -I don't know. Go! Shlomko. -What? -Let's help him. Tell him where to find a phone. I'm not from here. Gabrush? -I never use the phone. Don't listen to those thugs. Go call the police! Shlomko, come here. Casa! Casa! Hey. There's trouble. -Yes, I see. They've sent you a greeting card. We've got company. I know him. That Servesky from the municipality. We aren't afraid! We'll beat them up! They put up red notices. They're kicking us out. Gentlemen. -Hello, Mr. Servesky. Never say hello to evil doers. Today you've received a third and final warning. Oh yeah? I'm giving you a third and final warning. No threats, Simon. Don't forget you're on parole since your last threat. Let me at him! -Listen up! These houses are in danger ot collapsing. One more rain storm and a disaster could happen. If you would at least fix your own houses perhaps the city engineer would let you stay a few more years. That's right. -You're right. Why won't the city pay for it? -Exactly. In Jerusalem, with my own two eyes I've seen the city pay for repairs. These are your houses and the city doesn't have enough money. Is that our fault? Mr Servesky, we aren't to blame. Guilty or not, next week you'll be talking to bulldozers. You aren't Jews. -Bastards! You don't have a heart. -I'm just doing my duty. We won't let you! We'll beat you up! It won't help you. I've got the city plans right here! What's he talking about plans? You saying we aren't Jews? Go plan your ass! Casablan. Casablan. Mr. Simantov, please. No violence. What's wrong with you? What was written there? It won't help you, Simantov. These houses will be demolished. Demolished? Will be? That's a good word for it. Demolished is even better. I have nothing to say to people like you. You don't talk like that to the king. Gonna send him to the hospital, Casa? No violence, please. You'll get in trouble with the police. I've got the police round my finger. You think he'll kick me out? I give out the licenses in Jaffa. Not the municipality. Bravo, Casa. Good for you. We'll beat them up. All of you are going to jail! -Don't get upset, Mr. Servesky. Mr. Simantov, don't get angry. We'll hold a meeting and do this peacefully. It won't do any good, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Nobody, don't speak Yiddish here. Shmuckolovsky! Don't think I've forgotten about the tires. "Our hearts are tired! Tired! Tired of worshiping you! "Our hearts are tired! Tired! Tired of worshiping you! " "Our hearts are cleansed. Cleansed. Cleansed to worship you..." Don't misjudge them. They aren't animals. They have a pure heart. Pure. Like children. We're all children. Look at them. Look. Good people. Simple people. They don't hurt anyone. Believe me, we don't ask a lot of life. What is it we're asking for? Some work. Some rest. A bit of living. And what does the municipality give us? City plans. They want to demolish our neighborhood. Why? They say it's too old. The walls have wrinkles. The doors have rheumatism. The steps have a limp. And the windows can't see very well. Maybe they're right. But where will we go? Where will we go, Mr. Feldman? Where? I don't know, Mr. Babiov. Maybe we won't go at all. That's why we're collecting money. What about you? Will you donate? Sure. Did everyone donate? Yes, yes. -Okay. What's the money for? -for a fund. Maybe we'll get a lawyer to consult with. Maybe the law gives us rights. Law, shmaw. We need to beat them up. We need a lawyer! -Why? What for? Because a lawyer has a brain and you only have an ass! Don't say ass to me. Barbarian! -Don't call me a barbarian, you whitey. Good evenining, Rachel. Aren't you staying for the meeting? I can't. I have night school. Don't come back late. -I'll be home at ten, Mother. People, please come closer. I want to begin the meeting. I ask you all to come closer. Everyone take a chair and sit around here. Please, people. I'm beginning the meeting. Please. -I don't understand what the meeting is for? Let's all go to City Hall and start a hunger strike. I've been on a hunger strike all my life. I'm always hungry. They wouldn't dare demolish houses in Northern Tel Aviv. Don't shush me. I want to begin the meeting. -Excuse me, Mr. Feldman. They're offering us cheap housing. Maybe we should consider it. What's cheap? If they exchange our aparntment for another, that's fine. A store for a store. They won't do that. It not, let them go to hell. Maybe we should pay for repairs. We could get loans from a bank. You're bourgeois. Maybe you'll get a loan. Money sticks to money. -Just like shit to shit. Let's get loans, buy different apartments and get out of this pit! Maybe for you it's a pit. for us it is home, Mr. Gulash. I don't like being called Gulash. -Whatever. People, I ask the heads of family who haven't yet donated to come and pay their share. I ask you all to pay. We need a lot of money. Please come forward. And don't forget. Everyone pays according to the number of rooms. Here's my share. Write down Babiov. I'm only donating 100 Lira, Mr. Feldman. I'll pay next month. Moshiko, how much did you give? -200 Lira. 200 Lira? You ninny. Each room is 50. four rooms is 200. Four? We only have three. -What about the porch we closed? The porch? We don't even pay municipal taxes for it. You're supposed to cheat the city. Not the neighbors. What do you think, Madame Butterfly? Moshiko... She drove me nuts. Write down that I payed. -Thank you. -David Cohen. -Thank you. What's all this money? Is there a party? We're collecting from the neighbors. Maybe we'll repair the houses. Maybe we'll get a lawyer. What about you? Won't you give? -He only knows how to take. What's your problem? Do you want to get beat? I understand you won't donate. -I already donated my part. Listen, Mr. Feldman. That's a lot of money. Make sure it doesn't run off. -Run off... Hey, Gulash. Did you hear them? Gangsters. Be careful of them. Thieves! We must decide what to do. Move to another neighborhood or stay here and repair the houses? I say we stay here. -I say we move. Let's vote. Is this a democracy or isn't it? Of course it is. What's "democracy"? Democracy means everyone does what they want. Democracy is good. In a democracy you vote. If you're in favor of moving,, raise your hand. 48 in favor. Now, if you're in favor ot staying and repairing the houses, raise your hand. Mr. Shaky Hands, raise your hand or I'll break it. 48 in favor. 48 in favor of moving,, 48 in favor of repairs. What do we do now? -It's a democracy. "Democracy means equality between the rich and the poor. "But we still must discover why some are more equal than others. "Demo, Demo, Democracy. Demo, Demo, Democracy. "If you have a complaint, Don't tell anybody. "Don't object to the law. Just keep quiet democratically. "Demo, Demo, Democracy. Demo, Demo, Democracy. "The Sepharadim are the majority, but who is prospering? "The Ashenazim, that's no joke. Because they made the laws. "Demo, Demo, Democracy. Demo, Demo, Democracy.

We can talk on the way home. Perhaps... we could walk on the beach? What do you want? -I told you I want to speak with you. Then just say it. What do you want? You know what I want. Yanush, I'll scream. Stop being ridiculous. I can't sleep at night. -Take a pill. A civilized man from Hungary attacking a girl like that? It's none of your business. Go away! You really scared me, Gulash. I don't like being called Gulash. -You'll get used to it. Yanush, go home. -You heard the lady. Get out of here. Go to hell! I must go. Good bye. Thank you. Can I walk you home? Along the beach? -Along the beach. You don't like Yanush. -Absolutely not. He annoys me. His face is begging to be hit. And do you hit everyone who annoys you? -Yes. A man should learn to control himself. What for? -That's the difference between us and animals. I'm an animal? -I don't think so. But I do think you're a wild man. Why are you smiling? I was just thinking what would happen if someone else would have said that to me. What's wrong with you? Go away. -Where to? I don't know. I'll come later. What should we do till you come? What you do every day and every night. Go back to your corner. What's wrong with you? So what should we do? -Who knows? Let's kill time. What time is it? "What's happening? What's happening? "Nothing's happening. "What's happening? What's happening? "Nothing's happening. "We're just living life. A fabulous life. "Compliments of the Baron, How nice for us. "What's happening? What's happening? "Nothing's happening. "It's not a criminal matter. -What's yours is mine. "I'm your brother in law because your sister... -Y s? -Works for me. "We ransom the storeowner. He's happy if he's insured. "If you're in a sticky situation, let the lawyers make a living. "We don't care for the courts' well being,, "They'll make fools of all of us. "Where's the law? -Far away. "Where's the policeman? -With a lady. "Where's the lady? -In the hospital. "And the policeman has a bastard child. "A girl? A girl? A girl? -Where's a girl? "A girl? A girl? A girl? -Where's a girl?

"When can I meet you? -He's totally nuts. "I'm down on my knees. -Forget it. He's on parole. "Take a pearl necklace. -Here's the police. You're busted. "See how terrible it is. "Here's a girl. -There's the police. "Here's the police. -No more girl. "No girl. "So we start over "Like nothing ever happened. "What's happening? A girl. "What's happening? I don't have a girl. "A rich secretary. A police report. "Nothing's happened yet." You're brave. -Why? A girl at midnight, walking in the neighborhood with Casablan. That takes courage. -Why? Is Casablan afraid? No, the neighbors. Good night, Casa. Would you be willing to meet me sometime... Not coincidentally? -I'll think about it. Think it over. I'm a Moroccan. Does that bother you? It doesn't bother me. Who's there? Who's there? Who? Who? Who are they? What is this? Oh my god. Who is this? Casa... What did they do to you? Get up. What did they do to you? They busted you up. Get up. Get up. Who were they? The devils! Do you know them? Sit down. Come here. Come. Maybe we should take you to a doctor. Does it hurt? Your heart hurts more, eh? Casa, why did you have to go roaming in territory not meant for you? If your mother knew you were dating an Ashkenazi girl she would have killed you. Damn. There are sons of bitches in this world. "Come look from the clock tower. "Look at the sky, a thousand stars above. "Smell the scents and watch the sunrise. "Then you will feel it within, You'll feel you've returned. "You're in Jaffa.

What happened to your face? I fell out of bed. Give me a kiss. What happened? We looked for you all night. No, seriously. Who beat up your face? Who did that to you? -I don't know. It was dark. I bet it took 5 of them. -Two. Rosa, drinks for everyone. Everyone? Did you get rich? -No, but I feel rich. Something happened to you tonight. You got beaten and you're happy? Happy as can be. Like a bird. What is this, a cemetery? Onasis, music. I'm asking you not to go there. -Don't tell me what to do. I didn't raise you to do this. Father! Did you want something from me, Mr. Feldman? I want to speak with you. -About what? You know. -No. She's my only daughter. I don't have anyone but her. You know that Mania is my second wife. She's not Rachel's mother. I raised the girl by myself with my own two hands. And you're afraid of my hands. I'm asking you, Simantov, to leave her alone. She's not for you. -Why? You can have anyone you want here in Jaffa. You can find a girl that suits you. What do you mean by "suits you"? You know what I mean. So what do you say? I'll think about it. What? Get out of here. What did Mr. Feldman want? Did he bring you her dowry? Casa, don't take it too hard. They aren't worth your shoe sole. Forget about it. -I don't care about anyone. Me neither. Me neither. You're number one. Every kilo of you. Will you marry me, Rosa? We'll have a million children. Rosa, you're my queen. My love. Rosa! Rosa! Oh Rosa. What a pose. Oh, Rosa! Hopa! "When I saw you laughing loudly, my little girl, "I suddenly felt as if a knife had cut into my chest.

"Rosa, Rosa, Rosa, Rosa. You are my love. "How many songs must I write for you until you'll be my wife? "Rosa, Rosa. You are my love." Hello, Mr. Yanush. I see yesterday's decision isn't to your liking. Certainly not. The majority decided. The majority rules. Yes. For instance, I wanted to crack them on the head, but the majority said no, so we won't. Mr. Simon, instead of cracking heads you must think with your head. Cannibal. It's your turn. Cannibal! Mietek, I need to speak with you immediately. Can't you see I have customers? Does it have to be on Friday? Come to our house on the Sabbath. We'll talk over a cup of tea. Tomorrow, then. Hello, hello. You deserve a medal, madame. You broke Casa. How did you break him? Did you say something to me? -Yes. Sure did. I've never seen him so messed up. Look what time it is and he still hasn't woken up. Maybe he's sick from the beating. -What beating? Last night. Someone gave him a makeover. Who? -He has his honor. He won't tell. I bet 50 Lira she's going to pay the sick a visit. Hi. I heard you're sick. -Yes, I drank a lot last night. It's nothing. -Who did this? Never mind. I see you don't need... Thank you. for coming. Sabbath I want you to come eat lunch with us on the Sabbath. You want me to come to your house? -Yes, to eat with us. Me eating with your parents is like... turning a celebration into a funeral. -I'm asking you. It's impossible. It's not so hard. It's a short walk from here. The distance from here to your house is... a thousand kilometers. -Maybe not. Will you come? You really want me to come to your house? -Yes. Will your father be there? -He'll be there. He will? Will you come? -I have to consult. Do you think I'm wanted here? -Yes. Very much. -Really? Excuse me just a moment. You're leaving me alone? -One second. Mietek, we have to go in. Father, please. Don't do this to me. Mietek, I'm asking you. -Leave me. Don't bother me. Mietek, I'm asking you. Stop acting like a child. -Go alone. Go alone. Mietek, he's already here. -How can you act this way? You want me to sit and eat with him? -He's waiting inside. With that gangster? Leave me alone! Leave me! -I'm asking you. Look at how you act. I'm ashamed of you. No way! -Get in there. Enough! Get out! Shabbat Shalom. Shabbat Shalom. Cheers. Father, turn off the radio. -The news is coming on. Cheers. My gefilte fish is a real success today. Fantastic. Do you like it with horse radish sauce? Hot sauce. Use a little so it won't be too sweet. Is this sweet fish? -It's gefilte fish. Didn't you have gefilte fish in Morocco? father, gefilte fish isn't an oriental food. Bon appetit. Is it too spicy? -Sweet. Use a little horse radish sauce. You won't find a gefilte fish better than Mania's. It's really good. Dip it in the horse radish sauce. Your fish is a delicacy. "That was our program 'Cantor's Prayers'." How was the fish? -Great. Have another portion. It's 2 o'clock. This is the news. -Quiet. The news. "IDF has said that a military vehicle drove over a land mine "near Merom Golan in the Golan Heights. 3 soldiers were injured. "Two hurt seriously and one with medium injuries. "Trails have led back to the Syrian border. "A French reporter..." It will never end. -Were you in the military? Who wasn't? -He received a medal of honor. How do you know? -I know. I took an interest. Why did you get a medal? -No... He saved his commander's life. He walked through a mine field during battle. If I hadn't have gone, someone else would have. But you went. Shabbat Shalom. Hi, boss. Hello, miss. Beautitul, isn't she? Please. -Is this your car? Uncle Abraham went to America and decided to loan it to you. Uncle Abraham. Please. -Please. Where's the key? That's the key? -It's a special kind. America. -Fits in your pocket and you can hardly feel it. A folding key. -Yes. From America. A present from George. -Which George? -Washington. He's from America, too. Check if the carpet is dirty. You have a lot of relatives in America. -He has relatives all over. Even in Japan. -Japanese Moroccans. Turn it on already. This can drive from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem before you can say "Casa, I love you." How's Jerusalem sound? -Sounds good. -Go! Finally we'll have a boy! What happened? Congratulations. They said we got one on the phone. -What did we get? A boy or a girl? A boy! A boy! -A boy! A boy! Mariuma. -We have a boy, Niko! -Mama mare. I'm mama mare. -A grandmother. Moshiko! -Yes? Why are you standing there? We must go to the hospital to see Sarina. Go get a taxi. -Taxi! Taxi! Mr. Babiov, there is no taxi here. There's hardly a pick up truck. Pick up truck! Pick up truck! Congratulations. -I'm a grandmother. Listen to them. Like a zoo. Mietek, listen to a wise man from Budapest. We must leave this place quickly. We're alone. Leave this place behind. I'll help you get a loan. The people here believe in me. I can't just leave them. But Mietek... -I forgot the blanket. Excuse me. I'm asking you, is this a place fit for your daughter Rachel? With me, she'll live in an air conditioned apartment. A palace. Windows on three sides. Scandinavian furniture. Everything. What do you mean she'll be living with you? After we're married, of course. Did you discuss this with Rachel? No. I'd like you to talk to her about it. Tell her how intelligent I am. I speak languages. I'm set for life. And my store is profitable. And I'm... European. I know how to behave in society and... I learned to play the piano. That's important, isn't it? Beside, I've already been married once. So I know how to treat a woman. And don't forget that I love her. You want me to tell all of that to Rachel? We'll have the briss in our yard. Next time it's your turn. Mariuma! Mariuma! Wait, I made you a blanket to keep the child warm. Thank you, Mrs. Feldman. You really are good people. Bless you. No. I don't think we'll leave this neighborhood, Yanush. Moshiko is coming. -Hey, Moshiko. Congratulations, Moshiko. Did you see the boy? -I saw him. He's barely one day old. He's this small, but he's a true Babiov. He laughed. He laughed at my face. I said... and as soon as he heard me, as soon as he saw me, he laughed. He laughed. What can I say? Sometimes life can be so wonderful. Only sometimes. Excuse me. Is your name Yosef Simantov? Yes. Why? In Romania, a guy like that would get at least 5 years. Kick him out of the neighborhood! We'll return it after we check for fingerprints. There's really no need. Even if you don't find any prints, we have no doubt who did it. -A court needs evidence. Thank you. They're coming. That's Sergeant Mizrahi. I know him. Those are for fingerprints. The nerve of that man. Coming here to eat lunch and stealing from us? -He didn't do it. He didn't do it. -He didn't do it! He didn't do it! I did it. The saint, Rabbi Simantov. That criminal! How can you defend that dirt bag? The Babiovs, the Spiegels, the Nasimovs. Every penny of theirs is like a year's work. What will we do now? -He didn't do it! I know he didn't do it! Rachel. Rachel. Rachel! "Why is the sky so sad? "Why does my heart ache? "The birds are silent, "The birds and the gulls fly into the waves. "I'm so scared. I'm so scared, "that he won't return. "The fishermen lower their glances. The peddlers have stopped calling. "And in the city streets, the laughter is gone. "He's so near to me, and yet so far. "I'm so scared. I'm so scared, "that he won't return. "His touch upon my hand and my whole body trembles. "One penetrating look and my whole body burns. "One smile from him and I could die. "I hear his voice, I hear his voice. "Perhaps he's come "Risen from an abyss In the day and in my dreams. "I do not know, I do not know "He's farther from the port "as if he's leading and not being led "and only one sentence, one sentimental sentence "does he leave in my heart." Look at her. She doesn't know if she's coming or going. Bless her. How could this happen? She never could stand that Casablan. Now her heart is spinning like mad. She'd throw herself in the sea for him. Go figure. Sir, don't stay with him alone. Sometimes he gets mad. I've dealt with his type in Jerusalem. Don't worry. It's okay. Simantov... That name sounds familiar. Casa? Josh... Leave us alone. How are you? -You can see for yourself. It's been about a million years. -Yes. A million years. How... We met up, eh? Where did you disappear to after your service? -I went around. What else? -I killed time. Are you working? What are you doing? -Read the file. I get paid to not cause trouble. Why didn't you ever call me? -You got lost. I didn't know where you were. I went to the hospital a few times. They said you'd been rehabilitated. Fixed up. They said you were transferred to the North. I went North. You weren't there. I thought you were dead. -Yeah. I moved around a lot. They sent me abroad for an overall treatment. Yes, you look good. Like new. I never would have guessed I'd meet you here. Sergeant Yosef Simantov. What are you doing in this cell? Case number 7653/73. -Yes. Attacking an officer. Carrying a hand weapon. Running a poker club. You've done a lot since the war. Six years is a long time for a guy like me. Sir. When we were in the military, I don't remember you talking this way. What way? With a sense of inferioriry. And bitterness. I don't understand you, Casa. -Out of sight, out of mind. You're talking bullshit. -Maybe. You know what, Josh. I'll put it this way. I feel interior. I'm bitter. I'm an animal. I'm... what's it called? Frustrated. But between you and me, why is it that in six years... In six years you never found me? So what? You think I forgot you? -Oh, you didn't forget. But you didn't remember, either. No one remembered. Not Moshe. Not Uri Grossman. No one! No one! The war ended and everyone went home. But what about me? What about Casa? I don't have a home. You were my home. Did anyone from our tent ever invite me over for a drink? To listen to records? Mozart? So I can hear him once. So I won't think it's just a brand name drink. Casa... -Shimale Goldstein got married at the Hilton. He didn't know my address and couldn't send me an invitation. He should have come by foot. To knock on my door. Just like I carried him on my back for miles in the Golan. Casa, wait. -Wait. Why? I've thought about this shit for six years. No one cares! Everyone has their own shit. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Take control of yourself. Go get a job and be a man that doesn't care if he was invited or not to a stupid wedding at the Hilton. Now, back to business. I just want to know one thing. The money that got you in here... did you take it? That's how life is. Sometimes you're up and sometimes you're down. But, Casablan is always down. I have no idea why. If you look inside him he has a heart of gold. To die for. He wouldn't take our money. He maybe a pimp, he maybe a burglar, he maybe a thief, but he's an honest man. Honest? As long as we're paying. There's no time to waste. We should start packing. Of course. Soon the city will come and start demolishing. Where will we go? -I'm going to Ramle with my Itzhak. Sad days are coming to Jaffa. The happiness is gone. And the people are leaving. Soon we'll be going, too. With Sarina and the baby. Lord, if they ruin this yard, where will we have the briss? Where? In a day or two, Servesky will come with the bulldozers. What will we do? Have mercy, Lord, for my soul has witnessed you. Only a miracle can save us. A miracle. "Demo, demo, democracy. "Demo, demo, democracy. "Demo, demo, democracy. "Democracy." Mr. Servesky, please meet Shemer, the architect and Vishinsky, the engineer. They've written a letter to the mayor. You should hear it. "To the Mayor of Tel Aviv-Jaffa. "Honorable Mayor, "In the matter of neighborhood 124/25, known as Kaf Neighborhood... Kaf? -Kaf in Jaffa. "I would like to express my professional opinion, "that following the repairs, "and after the buildings were thoroughly examined, "we have reached the conclusion "that the houses in the neighborhood are stable and fit for residents. "We advise that another examination be done by city engineers "50 years from now." 50 years. This is not possible. You can't make a mockery of the city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa. I'll object to this. -Mr. Servesky, it won't do you any good. We've already had one miracle. The second one is coming. What miracle are you talking about? Everyone sees, darling. Everyone sees. Your body is outside, but your heart is in prison. Forget it. That bastard got a hold of your heart, eh? But to tell you the truth, it's a good thing. It's good. Look at my daughter, Sarina. She got herself an Askenazi boy. You can get a Sephardic boy. Why not? Look at our grandchild. He's a little of both. Hair as black as the night. Eyes as blue as the sea. That's what the good book says. He'll be as smart as a Sephardi and a rascal like an Ashkenazi. A Sephardic husband is a good thing. A Sephardic husband respects his wife. A Sephardic husband is a man. Moshiko! Moshiko! -Yes? Finish up with your chatter. Come home. I'm coming, I'm coming. My fat little wife is upset. The lab tests prove that your fingerprints are on the box. The rest of the evidence is against you. But I'm sure you didn't take the money. How do you know? You haven't seen me in six years. What do you know about me? I know you. You didn't take it. That's no way to investigate. They'll say you're playing favorites. You were at their house on the Sabbath. -Yes. You were left alone in the room. -Yes. You saw the box. -Yes. And you didn't take the money. Answer me. Help me get you out of this mess. Why are you laughing? Maybe you were a good officer in the military, but as an investigator you're not so good. Casa, did you take the money or not? What do you think? Go. I don't want to see you here again. You're letting me go? -For now. Thank you, Josh. -See you. In the next war. "Everyone always says: 'You're the best, Casablan'. "But they always spit in your face, Casablan. "Since the day you were born they said you weren't a man. "Always knives, curses, beatings and blood "Casablan. "That's not adult behavior, Always using force. "Getting hot over everything, having a temper. "So don't yell all day and night like a saint, "Get it out of your head. "Don't be like a woman. "Look what a shame. "Get off me, Casablan. "You're smarter than anyone. "Casablan. "Try learning something from others, "Casablan. "Stop debating every day. "Be normal and peaceful. "So no one will laugh at Casablan. "Casablan. "Stop yelling every day and night like a cantor at a grave, "It's time you got used to being a man. "Tired of everyone's suggestions. "It's time you did it on your own. "Don't be like a woman. "Look at what a shame. "Get off me, Casablan." What a surprise. Yanush, I need to speak with you. Your father spoke with you, right? I know you took the money. What money? What are you talking about? Because of you, an innocent man is sitting in jail. Innocent? That gangster is innocent? Do you know how many times he's been reported to the police? If he didn't steal that money, he stole some other money. For your own good, I suggest you return the money. Don't interfere with police matters. It's not befitting a girl like you. Let's talk about a much nicer subject. Listen to me for once and be patient. Casa... -I'm sorry I'm interrupting. Casa... -Get out! I want to tell you something. -You've said enough. Get out. He took the money. That's why I'm here. Do you believe me? Only this country sets criminals free out of fear. The fact I didn't kill you last week doesn't mean I won't kill you today. Casa... Nisim! Ariel! -You're here, too? Today we get even. For the night you attacked me from behind, too. Remember? Wait. I'll introduce you to my front end. Casa... -Get out. Wait outside. Let's go. Blessed be his name. Say it. Go ahead. Where's the money? -What money? What are you talking about? Casa! Take him. Take him. Casa... -Casa... -Go to hell! Casa, wait. I want to talk to you. Casa, do you want to have a drink with me now or at my house on the Sabbath? I'll call you. Wait for my call. "Peace be upon us and peace for Israel.

According to tradition, he should be named after his deceased grandpa. But I'm still alive and kicking, praise the lord. Alive. Touch on wood. Alive and how. What is the father's father's name? My deceased father was named felix Abramesko. Felix. Heaven forbid! We can't call him Felix. What will we call him? -Why don't you call him Yosef? Yosef? What Yosef? -Yosef Simantov. The godfather. Oh, sure. -Right. Wait, where is he? -Where is he? Hey, gang. Where is he? Wait, I'll get him. I'll get him. Casa, come out. They're naming the boy after you. Wild man. Here he comes. Welcome. Hello.
