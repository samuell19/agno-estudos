- Hey, Phil? - Yeah? - We're about to go up. - Going up in what? - Five. - Going live in five? Yeah. Yeah, all right, fuck it. Uh, yeah, yeah, okay. Adamsville... Okay. All right, go ahead. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Hello, and welcome, all listeners. It's the spookiest man on Adamsville local airwaves, DJ Freaky Phil, coming at ya, live. And may I just say, happy Halloween to all you cool cats out there. And on this all Hallows Eve, it is my duty, and truly my pleasure to regale you with the most horrifying tale to ever chill the bones of this fine town. Dig. Back in the summer of 84, seven of Adamsville High's own decided to go on a trip. They was all counselors at the local summer camp. And at the end of the summer, they got their own weekend to go party alone. But this year, they wasn't alone. Find out what happens to them next after this brief message from our lovely and loyal sponsors. Your friend is in grave danger. Oh, which one? You know the sad, pathetic one. Looks like a poster child for antidepressants. Oh, Dan. When I was a young boy, Satan came to me as an imaginary friend. Daniel, what are you doing? I had no clue as to what Satan really was. I'm a monster. You'd be surprised, buddy. For thousands of years, Satan has corrupted the souls of men. Out of spite and jealousy. Satan, I asked you to stop putting body parts in the freezer. For it is through his seed that he can create the Antichrist. You really like this girl, right? Every time I talk to her, every time she talks, I just freeze. This time, let me hold the ring. For the last time, Satan, you can not possess my mortal soul. Then, what happens? I don't actually know for sure. But that shit is definitely bad. What is ideal, is if we stop Lucy before dad even realizes he's out of the furnace, where he belongs. I'm 80% sure I got my ass beat by my guardian angel, okay? You don't know that you've been waiting your whole life for this one moment. You need to show what you fight for. Who you fight for. But most importantly, who you are. Now go knock his fucking head off. Hey. Yo, have you seen this? One pro fight, right? But this Xavier Hall mother... But if you want to make that fight happen... - When'd he post this? - Earlier today. Do you really wanna go in that ring with a fighter who's a title contender? This is an opportunity that just don't come to any fighter starting out. I'm giving you more than hope. I'm giving you option. That's all Pope shit, that was all Pope. What you saying, you don't wanna fight? I'm sayin' you're not worth the fight. Hey, hey. Be cool tonight. Be cool. So, you gonna take the fight? I don't know yet. I mean, I know I gotta tell Quinn before anyone else does. Why would you go to any promoter without telling me first? I was gonna tell you about the fight. But I needed to wait till the time was right. If you were to do this, how would you win? I'm gonna try my best. Your best is way more than enough. Thanks, man. 'Cause that's what you do, when you care, Xavier. There's no way you can possibly understand what I'm going through. Xavier, you can't blame yourself. For what happens to your pa. They don't know what you've been through to get to this moment. Show 'em. Show 'em who you are. Fellpeller Studios presents. Mac n' Mac. They may not be the best cops on the force. Come on, Crisco.

And now folks, for the moment you've all been waiting for. Our feature presentation on this extra spooky, Halloween evening. For all you listening back at home and all you watching along on the big, or small screen, it is my pleasure to present you, the story of Camp Murder. All's I'm saying, man, is keep an open mind. I'm gonna open up your mind with this thing, if you don't stop trying to shag my sister, you creep. Listen, man. You've always wanted a brother, right? And I've always wanted to get my nuts up in your sister's guts. It's a win-win. Well, all right. Fair point. Well, what about this, though? Let's say one of your semen goes all "Rambo," right? Finds its way to my sister's tubes. She gets knocked up, then what? Look at me, would that be so horrible? Ah. Yeah. Yeah, it would, actually. Then I'd have a couple of retarded nephews like you, running around. Words hurt, Chubs. Words hurt. Well, maybe, but not as much as this axe does. Okay, fine, God! Here's to... beer in a bottle. Yeah. - That was weird. - Yeah. Sounded like something caught it. Fucking Jesus Christ. Mr. Buford. Mr. Buford. Jesus fucking Christ. You just gave me a heart attack. Sir, Ferg is dead. - What? - Uh, I... I don't know. We... we... we were out there, and... and a broken beer bottle came out of the woods and stabbed him in the chest. Well... did you see who it was? I didn't see who it was. It's dark out there. I can't see fuck all. All right. Okay, uh... you stay here. Call Gus, he's... he's in town. I'm gonna go see what's going on. Why call Gus? Think it through, brainless. It's the end of summer, and we've got counselors coming up this weekend. You have got to tell them, not to come here. You're right. All right, folks, opening credits are over so pay attention 'cause this part's important, it comes back into play later in the story. Hello. Hi, mom. Yes, mom. I'm gonna be home all weekend. Casey's not gonna be alone. Uh, who's gonna come over? All of my friends are gonna be at camp. No, they're not getting paid for the counselors' weekend. Am I getting paid to watch Casey? Hmm. Yeah. No, I know. Okay. Okay. Love you too. Bye. Hello? Hey, Mary. Goddamn. You... you answered fast, you know that? Andy? That's insane. I was just about to call you. Yeah, no. I know. I know, I can, you know, I can... I can sense these things, babe. Andy, are you smoking? I'm not smoking a cigarette. - Andy! - What? Hey, we talked about this. Yeah, you know, the boys are over and you said you don't have a problem with grass. It's not like I'm smoking a dart or something. Yeah. So, off the hook, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Off the hook. Great, 'cause, babe, let me tell you something. I've got something that's going to cheer you right up. Guess where you're coming tomorrow? Camp, with us. Ugh, Andy, don't even say that. It's just gonna make me upset. - You know I can't come. - And, why is that? Because I promised my mom, I'd watch Casey. You promised? Yes. Okay. What exactly did you promise? Just that I would watch Casey. Just that you would watch her? You didn't say where you'd be watching her? No. I just said that she wouldn't be alone. Okay. So, bingo-bango, babe. That's problem solved. All you gotta do is you bring her with you. You can even tell mom and pop that you're bringing her. She's not gonna be alone. She's gonna be the exact opposite of alone. Andy... don't be ridiculous. Look, Mary, I really didn't want to bring this up, okay? But this is a very key stage in our relationship if... if I'm just left unattended, like... like a free range buck, you know, to my own devices for a whole weekend. Who's... who's to say what can happen? I could really be swept right off of my feet, right off from under you. Oh, yeah? By who? Chester and Noah? Stranger things have happened, you know. Somehow, I just doubt that. All right, look, Mary, I'm gonna come by your place at nine am tomorrow morning, okay? If you don't want me to come, then just say, "Stay away," right now, and I won't do it, all right? How's that? Say, "Andy, I do not want you to come pick me up. "I'd much rather stay home. "And, in fact, I never even cared about you in the first place." Just say that and I won't come. Okay, babe? So, I'll see you at nine? I'll think about it. So, I'll see you at nine? I will... I will think about it. Mary! - Yeah? - I'll see ya. I'll see ya. Casey? Are you packed for the weekend? - Hi. - Hey, ladies. There she is, prettiest girl on this planet. You know, your sister does not look bad either, does she, Case? Ugh, oh, and speaking of Casey, you owe her $10. - Do I, now? - Mm-hmm. My parents think I'm staying home with her this weekend. So, we're buying her silence. Naturally. Of course, we are. Case, I better not see more than $10 missing from there, okay? No promises. Very funny. You ladies ready to get going? Yup. Wait, why am I the only kid coming to camp? Uh, well, you know, at the end of the summer, when the kids all go home, they let the counselors come back. Kinda run the show for a weekend. But don't you guys get bored without kids? Usually, yeah. We do. Um, this year, you're coming, so we're not gonna have - that problem. - Mm-hmm. Oh, there she... Yeah. I don't know how she does... How you just fall asleep like that? - God, I wish I could do that. - I resent her for it if I'm being honest. Baby, I'm just glad she likes me. Baby, everybody likes you. Thank you. I really hate the way this new haircut makes my ears look... I just really don't like it. You lose points, by the way, for not noticing. I noticed. I... I could tell you didn't like it. So, I pretended not to notice. You're hilarious. But seriously, I just... I can be really sensitive about it. Can you just make sure they don't make fun of me, okay? What are you talking about? You know how the guys can be. They can be such assholes. Just... promise you won't let them make fun of me. Yeah. I promise. Okay. Ready to go? Let's get going. - Ready? - Yeah. Boys, boys, boys. What's up? Big weekend. Jer Bear. - What's up, man? - Looking good? - How you doing? - So boys, how'd you get up there? So, did you talk to him about it yet? Shh. No, I haven't talked to him about it yet. Why? Come on. I just really want this weekend to be about having fun, Trish. You can have some fun. Some little alone time fun with Andy. Look, I just.. I don't really think I'm ready for that yet. Okay. Fine. I just want you to, so badly. I know you're ready. It's fun. I... when I'm ready, I know exactly who to come talk to. I can give you some tips. Oh, I know you can. All right. I'm calling the boys. Let's do it. Yell-o. - Chez. - Oh, it's Chez? Let me talk to him. Let me talk to him. Hold on. Andy wants to talk to you. Yo, what's up, man? - Andy? - Yeah. Uh, just letting you know, we're leaving, like, right now. So, we'll be there in half hour, 35 minutes. Sounds good, brother. All right. Sweet. Hey, man. Call him an idiot. - Hey, Andy. - Yeah. You're the best. Thank you, man. All right, I'll see you later. - What's the plan? - What's up, baby? One love. - You call him an idiot? - No. - Can you not hear me? - No. After you. We ready to go? Born ready. Trish, Jerry, Brett, this is my little sissy, Casey. Aw, I didn't know you had a sister. She looks just like you. Well, she's actually my stepsister, so... Oh. Sissy, what is a stepsister? You never told me. It's not important, Casey. It doesn't matter. - Jerry, are we ready to go? - Hey. Hey. Hey. On this vessel, I'm only to be referred to as, Captain Jer. And I'm ready. I fucking hate Captain Jer. By the way guys, my dad gave me his camera to use for the weekend. So, let's take some videos. Here, Casey, get with Brett. Cute. Here, do you wanna try? - Yeah. - Okay. Just push that button right there. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, folks. This next tune is called "The Last Road Trip You're Ever Gonna Take" by the Darts. - Get him. - Get him. - Get him, get him! - Get his ass. Get his ass! Get her foot on the ceiling, babe. Whoa. Whoa, look at that. Loving it. Now, give me... You're fed up with the world. I'm literally gonna kill you in two seconds. Oh, yeah? Two seconds? Two seconds. One, two... You're not gonna touch my girl, you're not gonna touch her. Motherfucker. You smoking in my kitchen? Get the fuck out of here, man. - Get out of here. - My bad. My bad. My bad. - You want? - No, get out of here. You gonna pass that? Shit. What the fuck? Devon, man. You scared the shit out of us. How long y'all two been out here? What time is it? - 8:30. - Shit. Man, we've been out here for like five hours now. So, you mean to tell me y'all two clowns been out here smoking it up, chilling. I'm in there working on Mr. Chekov trying to cook food for you fools for this weekend. And y'all couldn't even come in to help? Sorry, man. But, uh, duty calls. Duty calls, man. Duty calls. At least let me get in a hit, then... Yeah, of course, man. You earned it. Here. You, lazy son of a bitches. Sorry, Mr. Chekov. My ass. Anyway, there's food for the weekend and I have to go. Oh, shit, me too. Hey, Mr. Chekov. You still got that Walkman in there? Oh, yes, my friend. I almost forgot it. - It's in my office. - Hey, Mr. Chekov. You still keep your gun in there, too? Yes, Chester. I do. In fact, I keep it in the right top hand drawer, to be exact. Very cool, man. Very cool. Yeah. Hope no one forgets where it is. Just in case it becomes useful later. Don't go fuck around with it. It's not a toy. Yeah, I'll get your bag. Aw. You can't stay the weekend? Can't even do it. Well... where are you guys' cars? Oh, other lot on the far side. Okay. Well, maybe we see you in the Fall? I'll be around. See ya. Boys. I don't remember bringing any bags. I loaded them up when no one was looking. All right. Good enough for me. You ladies get bored without us? - Yes. - Brett. Always bored without you. Land ho! What? Like "land ho," you know, the vessel arrived. Land ho! We arrived like seven minutes ago. - I don't know, man... - To the cabin, then. What's up, smallish girl? - Hi, I'm Casey. - I'm Chester. Do you know you guys owe me $10? What? For real? Mm-hmm. Each. - Wha... what? Such bullshit. - Huh? Nothing. Fuck that girl, dude. For real, man. For real. You ready, man? Yeah, man. It's been a little while. All right. All right. All right. - Ready? - Yes, sir. Let's start. I don't want to fucking do this with you, anymore, Jer. It's been... It's been a while, man. Step into my office. Come on. All right. It's in the closet. Thank you. Thank you. Encore. Encore. I don't think he knows any other songs, do you, babe? I don't. Boo. What else you got? Gee... I don't know. How about a spooky campfire story? Ooh. Yes. Yes. Yes. So, I mean, I can only assume you guys have heard about the... the massacre here in 78, right? At this very campsite? I thought that was just a myth. Think again. It was a dark and spooky night. You know, it was a lot like tonight, - wasn't it, Mary? - You know what? Now that you mentioned it, Andy. It was a lot like tonight. There were exactly... seven people on the grounds that night, weren't there? And, a little girl. Some, nut-job, lunatic, psycho... busted out of an insane asylum, and paid this very camp... a little visit. A visit that would forever change this camp's name to Camp Murder. Duh, duh, duh. He donned himself in all black. Black sweater, pants, boots, gloves. And a mask, with reflective lenses. A shadow for the eyes. One by one, he picked them off with his hatchet. Chop. Chop. Chop. You know, by the time he was finished, there was less left of the campers' bodies than wasn't. - Uh-huh. - It took them days to figure out whose parts were whose. They say he still walks these very grounds to this day, waiting to strike again. Heard it. Whoa, heavy. For sure. And on that note, I'm gonna go in. I think I'm gonna head in too. Great timing there, old buddy. Got nothing to do with timing, Brett. It's a little thing called pacing. It's only Thursday night, we've got a long weekend of debauchery ahead of us. That, we do. Man, that's a pretty spooky story. I mean, for everyone besides me. Boo. Ow. So, uh, how was my timing? Are you referring to Brett the Jet's comments? No. Much as I hate to admit it. I... I... I don't think I'm ready. But I'm getting close. It's okay, hey, no, no. No, no, it's all right. No pressure, no pressure at all. It's just the wellbeing of my loins we're talking about. You know, they could just stop working, fall off and we won't be able to have kids. But it's the risk we're going to have to take, I guess. - Oh, God, shut up. - It could happen. So, uh, kids, huh? What? You, um, you just said "kids" back there. I don't know if we should get that far ahead of ourselves, babe. Maybe someday? Sure. Sure, yeah. Maybe someday. What? I thought I saw something. Give me a fucking heart attack. Do that again, I'm going to start withholding sex. Coming? Get up, bitch, we're going to the lake. Up, up, up, let's go. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. We're going to the lake, we're going to go to the lake. - Okay, okay. - Come on, come on, come on. Fuck me. Do you guys need help with carrying... Nah. Brave this heat Mary. Sixth grade, three days undefeated. Come on! I told you it's gonna... Bullshit! Come on, Andy, that's your fault. - All right! - Don't worry about it Brett. You can... you feel it. - I want the heat! - You want the heat? Strike her ass out of here, bro. No going easy on her! Oh, you know. Here comes the heat Mary. Better get ready. Let's go Mary! - Hah! - Oh, shit. - Hey! - Oh, shit, she roped it. Yeah, Mary! Someone forgot to tell us we're out of this game. You bet your ass Chez. That's a double. Will you put a fucking bow on it Andy? If I knew you're gonna be such a pussy, I wouldn't have picked you on my team. Would you chill out? We're going to fucking win anyway. How? I'll carry you. Don't worry about it. Nobody carries "The Jet," bro. Okay? You can eat shit and die. Eat shit and live, Brett. Brett. Brett. I don't want to be in the water anymore. I'm trying to win a game here, okay? Go... go stand in your position. - Are you kidding me right now? - Go stay in your position. Trying to win a game. - Do not talk to me. - Lock it in... - Do not talk to me. - Over there. Little prissy. - Hey, Jerry. - Ah, hey. You wanna look for shells or something? Ah, we gotta... we gotta play. I'm so... I... I... - Brett, Brett. - Don't look at me! Seriously, don't look at me right now. I'm not talking to you. Swing and a miss! I cannot be stopped. Brett, can you do something about this, please? I don't... sorry. Batter up. Let's go. I didn't touch it. All right, everybody, The Jet has finally arrived. - Mary... - Boo! Don't think I didn't remember what you did last inning. Guess what? Andy's not here to save you. And that ball's coming straight for those big ass ears of yours. Yeah, right. Ah, fuck, babe! My bad. Sorry. Throw back. Okay. Ball one. And that boy is out of here, baby. Call it game. All right, good game, everybody. Losers carry the cooler back, sorry, I don't make the rules. - Losers! - I am so sorry. - You ready man? - Oh, yeah, brother. So, let's blaze it up. Hey, man, I think we should, like, have girlfriends. - What for, bro? - I don't know. Seems like everybody else has one asides us. Makes us kind of feel like the odd mans out. Jerry doesn't have a girlfriend. Yeah, that's Jerry. Nobody likes that kid. - That's true. - Yeah. I didn't think of that. You know, man, we don't need girlfriends to not feel like the odd man out. You mean that? Yeah, man. You got to joint. This is about cashed out, so, I'm gonna head back, okay? Come on, man. We'll smoke on the dock. Will be the last time. Yeah, but I'm just kind of over it. That's cool, man. - I'll see you later. - Yeah. Oh! Fuck it. Hey, hey, hey. No! No, hey, ow! Uh, no! No! No! No! Water! Water! Come on! Oh, yeah! - Casey. - Where were you? We were at the lake. Yeah, you were at the lake. You realize you left me here? - Hey, um, Andy? - Yeah? Can I talk to you inside for a sec? Yeah. - Uh, Trish? - Yeah? Can you, um... Yes. What is your name? After you. You know what? I forgot. Oh, okay. So anybody wanna smoke some ganj? Fuck no. What's up, babe? I was hoping we could talk about what happened back there. Hey, babe, I didn't pick the teams, all right? I can't just toss you a gimme every single time you're at bat. I gave you the one, right? Not talking about that. I'm talking about how Brett said that shit about my ears like I said he would and you didn't do anything. I'm sorry, babe. Like, we specifically talked about it, you know? I know, I just... I forgot, I forgot. I mean, I don't know what you want me to say other than I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's not about what I want you to say. It's like, I just, like, want to feel like you hear me, you know? I don't... I don't really know what that means. Babe, to be honest, I mean, I made a mistake. I feel, like, you're kind of making this out to be, like, I purposely slighted you or something, I mean, I forgot something. Well, does it not matter to you that you promised? I mean, like, I specifically asked you to promise and you did. Okay, why are you attacking me? I mean, what, do I not feel bad enough? You want me to feel worse? I can cry or something if you want. I'm not attacking you. Andy, I feel, like, every time we try to have some sort of serious conversation, you get really defensive and you say that I'm attacking you. Because it feels, like, you're attacking. - I'm not attacking you. - Then what? You're not attacking me, what are you doing? I mean, 'cause you're beating around the bush. Why? Is there something you wanna say? What are we talking about? If you just listen to me, I can tell you. Okay, sorry. Please go. I feel, like... I feel, like, you don't really commit to me, you know? No. No, I don't know. You're my girlfriend, right? I mean, is that on a commitment? Ah, yes, I just... Do you ever feel, like... do you ever feel, like, everybody loves the Andy, because... because you don't really stand by anything or anyone? What the fuck is that even supposed to mean? I laugh at some fucking joke and now I don't stand by my girlfriend? You broke a promise or forgot you even made one, and you know what? I can't tell which one is worse at this point. You never want to have a conversation about our future. And every time we try to have a serious conversation, you just never happen to want to have it. Mary. I'm 18 goddamn years old. Okay? What do you want from me? You want me to get down on my bended knee and pull out a diamond ring? Gonna go throw on my shining suit of armor and go kick Brett's ass, what do you want? Yeah, I think I can go for some ganj here, let's go and do it. You know, I got a tent to set up. Oh, right, I forgot about that. All right. Bye, Caitlin. Why do you make everything serious to me into some kind of joke? Not now, Casey. Seriously. No, you can't just leave me here, I'm your sister. God damn it, Casey, you are not my sister, can you just fuck off? Great. Smooth, Mary. - Now we got to deal with this. - Can you stop? It's getting dark out. Come on. All right, fine. Let's go. You know, they've been in there for quite a while now, eh? Yeah, I want to say they got the tent set up, what... 30 minutes ago? Now, What can we do in a tent in 30 minutes? Brett the Jet, baby. Trish. Brett the Jet, baby! Adamsville, Brett the Jet, baby. - I'm drawing a blank. - Right? Brett the Jet, baby. Here he comes. Ah, Trish. Ah, here comes the jet. Ah, it's at 30. 20. Ah, it's a ten. What was that? What? I heard something outside. A... a noise? We're outside, you know? - What if someone's out there? - Like pervin' us? Yes, go check. Hey, assholes. See? It's nothing. Come on. I don't trust it. Just go check. Babe, Jet was about to blast off. Okay, you're not blasting shit until you go check. Fine. Uh-oh. What do we have here? It seems, like, Brett has expelled from the tent. While Trish has, uh, remained inside. Yes, indeed. Things have complicated. Indeed, indeed. Are you assholes out here? You know, I'm going to fuck you up if you are. - Case! - Casey! Come on, Case. Come on out. Casey, I'm sorry. Casey, you're the best, little sissy, please come back. Mary, look... you're... you're right, you were right. I was being a dick, okay? Let's just... Let's just find Casey, and when we get back, we'll have a serious conversation, okay? I promise. Just like you promised last time. Fuck it, fuck it, I tried, fuck it. Fucking bullshit. Jet's taking a piss. Don't want to get you dirty, baby. Ooh, we have contact. You know, see, I can definitely get myself in the right headspace to go round two that fast. You know, Jerry, it's hard for a lot of men, but that's assuming this still isn't round one. Indubitably. In doobie-dilly. Shut up. Oh! Attaboy, Brett. Can't help it. They don't call him "the Jet" for nothing, man. No. Oh, fuck, dude, she's fucking dead, man. Fuck! Dude, where the fuck you going? Where are you going, man? I'm getting the fuck out of here. Dude, we got to go get everyone else. You can go on Chester's car, buddy, I'm sorry, man. No! Chester has the keys. I don't even know where Chester is. Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck. Oh, Jesus, fuck. Ooh, tough spot for Captain Jer. Does he stay or does he go? Oh! I just hope he didn't forget to check the back seat. - Casey! - Case! Casey, are you in here? Come on Case, don't mess around! God damn it. I told you she wasn't fucking in here. It was worth a shot, wasn't it? Where is everyone? We need help. Jesus, Noah, what happened to you? Get the fuck out of here right now. Well... slow down. What are you talking about? There's no time to slow down. Trish is dead, and the van is gone. What? Jerry and I saw someone kill Trish and Brett's probably dead too, and then Jerry took the van. All right, Noah, be serious for a second, man. Are you fucking with us or what? - No, I'm not fucking... - Jesus! Fuck! Oh, my God! Don't fucking touch it! I'm just trying to fucking help, all right? Holy fucking shit. He's dead. All right, we gotta think, we gotta think. How the fuck are we going to get out of here, seriously? I don't know, he just said Jerry took the van. Well, I don't know. Maybe he hasn't left yet. - Ow! - What is that? They haven't left yet. Fuck me! All right, we gotta at least get to the road. Oh, Chekov's gun. Holy shit. You're right. It's probably still in his office, let's go. Hey, Jerry. No, don't, just don't look. Don't look, come here. Yeah, we gotta go. We gotta go. Come on. - Jerry. - Just go, we gotta go. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me. Okay, you're fine. You're okay, you're okay. Okay? Uh, where did he say that gun was? Um, uh, top right drawer. - Go check it. - Top right drawer! Babe, is there a key here? Is there a key? Wait, wait, wait. Oh, God! What, babe? Chekov never left last night. So, that means... - He never made it to his car. - Oh, yes. Babe, catch. Jesus, hey, um, babe, maybe don't throw that, yeah? Sorry. He said other lot on the far side, right? - Yes. - Let's get there then. - Wait, where are we going? - Not now baby, come on. What are you talking about? We have to go back for Casey. Mary, I'm not so sure that's a good idea. What are you talking about? Come on. It doesn't look like there's anybody left back there. - Andy, stop it. - We didn't find her. Andy, stop it. I'm sorry. I just really don't think it's a good idea. I cannot believe what I'm hearing from you right now. This is exactly what we were just fighting about. - Come on, don't say that. - Come on, Andy. - It's not fair, stop it. - Come on! Stop it! If you want me to be safe, then come with me. Baby, you know I have to. Baby we got this, come on. Come on, don't go Mary, please don't. Fuck! Stay the fuck away from my sister. Sissy! Casey. Casey, you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Are you okay? Okay, we gotta get you out of here, okay? Behind you! No, no, no, no. Please, please, please. - Nice shot, babe. - Andy. Andy! Andy! Come, babe. Come. Andy! Hey, Mary. Andy, we gotta get you out of here. Let's get you out of here, come on. No, no, no. Put me down. Just... just put me down. You came back. You came back! You know I had to. I know, I know. Mary, I'm going to be honest with you, okay? I don't think I have a long time. Don't say that. Don't fucking say that. Mary, I mean it. No. I love you. More than anything. I love you more than that. I love you more than that. Where's Case? - Where's Casey? - Casey! Hey, Case. It looks like... Looks like I will have to stick around here for a minute, okay? Just take care of your sister while I am gone. Okay, can you do that for me? I promise. Oh, thanks Case. Mary. I'll see you. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No! What Casey? What? We have to go. We gotta go. Ooh, tough break for Andy. You know, I bet you would have finally put out after that, too. All right, folks, for the final time on this extra spooky evening, can I just say happy Halloween. DJ Freaky Phil signing off. Dig?
