[birds chirping] [woman panting] [intense music] [man grunts] [man shouts] It's no use, Katie. Nowhere left to run. Come on, Nick. What are you gonna do? -What, are you gonna kill me? -Why not? -You're already dead. -Just don't do this, Nick... Nick, don't! No! [voice echoes] [Chloe] We're doing much better, so I think we're gonna get away this weekend. -Nice! -Yeah, you can cover for me? -[chuckles] Absolutely. -Awesome. Actually, um, that was my last table. Do you mind if I cut out early? [Chloe] Not at all. [Anna] All right, thanks. Oh, you just got somebody. You want me to take it? No. No, that's okay. I got it. -Good afternoon. My name's Anna. -Hey. I will be your server this afternoon. If you have any questions, just let me know. Will do. Hey, um... don't we go to the same gym? I'm sorry, I meant questions about the menu. Right. Uh, what's, what's good here? Um, let's see. The fried catfish is good. Um, the halibut, roast chicken is really-- You know, I watch you sometimes. At the gym. Oh. I just meant that I noticed you 'cause you, you know, you stand out. I know you're not from here and people don't, don't really move to this town. Where are you from? So, I think we're out of the shrimp tacos and also the salmon, I think. I can double-check with the chef if you like. It's okay. I see what you're doing. What am I doing? Trying to throw me off my game. [chuckles] Well, that's very cute. -What? -That you think you have game. Ouch. You know, you sweat a lot. That's true. You maybe wanna go out with me sometime? Uh, like, like a different restaurant? You know what, I-I'm sorry, no. -I don't think so. -Why not? I don't date customers. -I'll find another restaurant. -Really? -I'll leave right now. -And another gym, as well? Yeah. I'll cancel my membership, whatever. Just think about it. -Okay. -Cool. No. Nice try, though. [upbeat music] [Danny] Yes! Danny, that was amazing! -[whistling] -Whoo! [laughing] -So you don't like him? -Who? -Blue Eyes, from the restaurant. -Oh... -He is cute. -Why were you so mean to him? Mean? I was flirting. Okay, so maybe I'm a little rusty. [Chloe] Mm, you're way beyond rusty. Do you even want a boyfriend? Why do I need a boyfriend when we have all of this? Yeah! [Anna] Nice one. -Good job, guys. -Good job. -You want another? -[Chloe] Uh, no, I'm good. -Good. You? Sure? -I'm good. Thanks, Leon. [Leon] All right. [Chloe] When was the last time you went on a date? Ugh... I don't know. Before Danny? Look, you don't have kids, okay? -They change your priorities. -I have Kayla. She's Leon's daughter. You don't live with her. I still have, uh, maternal feelings. Maternal... [chuckles] Darling, that top does not say maternal. I do know that just because you have a kid doesn't mean you stop having sex. You know, honestly, guys don't even really approach me. Because you give off that stank, a do-not-talk-to-me vibe. Wow, "stank." That's harsh. Okay, wow, harsh. I-I don't do it consciously. He's obviously into you. Just go out with him. He seems so cool. -Cool, huh? -Hot. [mumbles] Hot? Well, if you like him so much, why don't you go out with him? I have a boyfriend. Do you? [indistinct chatter] -I'll be back. -Yeah. Hey! Girlfriend, nice to meet you. [indistinct chatter] Danny, nice one. Come here. Mm. Are you having fun? -Yeah? -Kayla's beating me. Well... Are you having fun? That's what matters then. Right? No, I wanna win. You wanna win? You wanna win? Someone wants to win? Who's gonna win? Okay. How about you beat me? Huh? [chuckling] Come on, Danny, we're gonna be late. Danny, come on. Danny, come on. What are you doing? What's happening? How come you never talk about my father? Well, why are you asking that? Kayla says it's weird I don't have a father. Hey. Of course, you have a father. W-Where is he? He's in the military. He's overseas. How come he doesn't call us? Because he's on a top-secret mission. What kind of top-secret mission? I don't know. That's why they call it top-secret. Sweetie, look. I have a very complicated relationship with your father. Okay? I'll explain it to you when you're a little older. I'm not a little kid anymore. I know. I know. Do you miss him? No. But sometimes I miss the life I had when I met him. [mellow music] Champagne? Oh, absolutely. So what do you think? About the painting? Sure, why not? Let's start there. I like it. Are you considering buying it? -Possibly. It depends. -Mm. Well, I'm just the assistant here. I can introduce you to the gallery owner if you'd like. I want your opinion. Okay. I'm a fan of the artist. He moved here from Russia with literally nothing, started over here and now he has his own solo art exhibit. -It's very inspiring. -Wow. Yeah. Yeah, I read that in the brochure. [both chuckling] I just can't decide if I love it. Don't buy it. -You seem sure about that. -I am. I mean, you're gonna have to look at it every day. Right? So you should love it without any reservations. You feel that way about relationships, too? Who said anything about relationships? Show me your favorite painting. -Really? -Oh, yeah. -Okay. -I'm Nick. I'm Kate. My friends call me Katie. Right this way. [Katie] Hi, Grace. Do you mind if I, um... [continues, indistinct] [Kate clears throat] Thanks for taking my recommendation. It's a beautiful piece. Well, I can tell you have impeccable taste. I might. Do you have any idea where you're gonna hang it? Oh, I could use your opinion on that, too. [whispers] [school bell ringing] -Hey, you need help? -Yeah. -No. I'm okay. -You got it? Oh! Don't forget your lunch. -Thanks. -Bye, sweetie, I love you. Bye. [outgoing phone line ringing] -[Evelyn] Hello? -Hey, Mom. Did you change your phone number again? [Katie] Um, yeah. I got another brand new phone. -I know I sound paranoid. -Oh, I get it. I just worry about you being stressed out all the time. [sighs] I'm fine. I'm, uh, I'm driving to work. I just dropped Danny off at school. Oh, sweet thing. How is he? Too smart for his own good. He started asking about Nick. Well, that was inevitable. What'd you tell him? I told him he was overseas, in the military. He's gonna figure out you're lying. -Kids are very intuitive. -I know, I know. He's already asking a lot of questions. I can't wait to meet him someday. -You will. -When? I don't know. I wanna see you, too, Katie. I wish you wouldn't call me that, Mom. You're always gonna be Katie to me. Aren't you tired of living like a criminal? You know, I really don't have a choice. I just want you home. Hey, listen, check your PO box. I sent you a package. New pictures of Danny. Oh. Wonderful. Listen, just please don't put them -where anyone can see them. -I know. You don't have to keep telling me that. -I miss you. -I miss you, too, Mom. -Every day. -[Evelyn] Bye. [ominous music playing] Hi, I'll have a bag of your Kenyan blend. -Sorry, we just ran out. -Oh, that's a shame. I'll just have a cappuccino then. -Name? -Evelyn. Just give me a second. Let me get that. I'll have a cappuccino as well. -It's okay, I got it. -I insist. Name for the order? Nick. Hey there, Evelyn. Nick. I'm sorry. Just a bit of a shock seeing you after all this time. -How have you been? -Thanks. I've been away. Just got back to town. How about you? I'm getting by, you know. You must miss Katie. I remember how close you two were. I think about her every day. I wanted to reach out to you ever since Katie's memorial. Why didn't you? I thought you might blame me, you might hold me responsible. Katie's... She was a troubled girl. It's not your fault she did what she did. I just wish I'd seen it, you know? I wish I knew how much pain she was in. We all do. But I-I think she's in a better place. I hope so. She was such a special person. She was. I'm still angry with her for what she did, but... at some point we have to move on with our lives. Yeah. Of course. I'm actually engaged to be married. Oh. That's wonderful. I'm happy for you, really. [man] Evelyn. Nick. Well, it was nice to see you, Nick. Can I tell you a secret? I have a fantasy. Katie's still alive. What do you mean? That she didn't actually kill herself. That it was all a grand plan... 'cause she was such a clever woman, you know? That's impossible. I know, I know. It just... It just makes me happy thinking of her living her life somewhere free, no trouble... That is a lovely thought. -Good to see you, Evelyn. -You, too. And thanks for the coffee. That chick in the yoga pants has sent her food back three times. -Oh, yeah. Sorry. -She hates me. -She just has it out for me. -I saw that. Sorry. What the hell are you doing here? -Hey, Leon. -Coming to have lunch. Since when do you eat here? I miss you. I miss our movie nights. -Don't... touch me. -I miss cuddle time. [cell phone ringing] Mom, are you calling from your cell phone? -Yes. -I told you that's dangerous. You're right. I'm sorry. I was just excited to talk to you. [Katie] What's going on? What would you think of me visiting you? [Evelyn] How long do you think the drive is? -Five or six hours? -Mom, you know we can't do that. -No, that's impossible. -No, listen. I ran into Nick today at the coffee place. -And he's changed. -Wait a minute, he's back? Oh, please tell me you're kidding. No, he's moved on, Katie. He's, he's engaged to be married. You spoke with him? He's different than I remember him. -Sincere. -He's lying. He's manipulating you, okay? That's what he does. It's not like that at all. I bet he followed you there. What did you say? Nothing. I played the role of the grieving mother. -You'd have been proud. -Tell me exactly what he said. I can't remember every word. Try. He said he has a fantasy that you're still alive, that you're just living your life like normal. He knows. Do you really think he'd follow me? Yes, Mom, that's why I have never given you my home address. That's why I drive 50 miles to the next town over to deliver a package. But it's been years. Don't you think he could've changed? Mom, he is a dangerous man. Okay? We cannot underestimate him. There are things I never told you. What things? It's better you don't know. Look, I, uh, I gotta get back to work. Please be careful. Okay? [Nick] Thank you. -[Katie chuckling] -What? You. You always pay with the big bills. Is that unusual? I don't know. I guess I'm just not used to this. You know, chef's menu, sommelier. For me it's usually just pizza and Netflix. Maybe you're hanging out with the wrong crowd. I don't know. Maybe. Maybe. There's something old-fashioned about you. You know that? You don't like it? I didn't say that. So, tell me about your business. What do you want to know? You never really talk about work. -What exactly is it that you do? -I'm an investor. I make loans to people who get rejected by banks. Loans? So you're, like, a loan shark? No, it's, it's connected to real estate. It's not that interesting. Oh... -I'm interested. -Hey, come on. I got you something. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. -What is it? -Open it. Wow! Nick, these are beautiful. Try 'em on. -They look really expensive. -So? You're so beautiful. I want you to have beautiful things. Don't you think we're moving a little fast here? What? What? I can't buy you gifts? Well, sure you can. Just not expensive ones. Why not? Because I think it creates certain expectations. I'm only 26, I'm just now beginning to figure out who I am. I don't want my whole identity to be just someone's girlfriend. -You know? -Yeah, no, I-- I get it. I'll just, I'll just bring the Ferrari back to the dealership. I'm sorry. It's just... we've been dating for a while, you know, and I thought... Hey, no. Look, it's sweet. It's just... I know, we've only been dating for a month, you know? What about we just slow it down a little... enjoy each other. Of course. Of course. Scream and you're dead. Understand? [muffled whimpering] [man 1] Quiet. Tell me where it is. Where's the money? Quiet. Nick! Nick! [groaning] Nick! Nick, Nick! Nick, be careful. Oh, my God! Nick! Nick! -[man groaning] -Nick, stop, stop, stop. Nick! -[choking] -Nick, Nick, stop! Stop it! Stop, you're gonna kill him! Nick, you're gonna kill him! Oh, my God! Stop! [Katie sobbing] [Katie] Babe... -Are you okay? -I'm fine. [crying] Where-- -Where's my phone? -[Nick] What are you doing? -I'm dialing 9-1-1. -Stop. -Why? -Give me your phone. Babe... Nick, Nick, it was self-defense. -Anyone can see that. -Get dressed. You should go. What... Wait, what are you talking about? -We have to call the police! -I can't have police here. It won't look good to my employers. What employers? I don't have time for questions, Katie! He tried to attack me, okay? He's wearing a ski-mask, for Christ's sake. The police are not gonna blame you. -No police. -Why not? Kate, if there's any suspicion, you're an accessory. I'm trying to protect you. Why can't we just tell them the truth? 'Cause I can't go back to prison, okay? -When were you in prison? -Enough. Put your clothes on and get out! [intense music] Don't you tell a soul about this. You hear me? Not your mother, not your friend at the gallery and definitely not the police. Understood? Hey. Hey. Everything okay? Yeah, yeah. -You looked upset. -No, I'm, I'm good. -I'm good. Thank you. -Yeah. Let's go. [Chloe] Can you believe he showed up to my work? Like, he thinks he's just gonna show up with his baby blues, and everything is just fine. [doorbell rings] Well, hey there. Nick, what are you doing here? I got the coffee you wanted, Kenyan blend. Thank you. It's very thoughtful. Aren't you gonna invite me in? Well, I'm a little busy right now, but it was very sweet of you to drop by. -I'll just stay a minute. -Now is not a good time. I wanna continue our conversation from earlier. Really got me thinking. Lovely home. Just as I remember it. Changed the couch, though, right? I got it reupholstered. Oh, look at that. So beautiful, wasn't she? Yes, she was. Yeah, she was. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. [Nick] Who's this little fellow? My godson. -Godson, huh? -Yeah. My best friend from high school. It's her grandson. Cute, isn't he? He really is. What's his name? -Danny. -Danny. How old is he? What? How old? Around eight, I think. He looks just like me when I was that age. Hm. Really? That's funny. Yeah, almost exactly, it's uncanny. Well, if you're gonna stay, why don't I make us some coffee? -Where is he? -Who? -My son. -What are you talking about? -Where is my son? -I don't know what you mean. Don't. Do not play with me, Evelyn! -You won't win. -No. I don't know what you mean! -Last chance. -I don't know-- I don't know where they are. Some town up north. She won't tell me. Where's the envelope this photo came in? [laughs] Thanks, Evelyn. Hey, can I help you? Yeah, I got a, uh, to-go order. Lucas. [Chloe] Yeah, uh, just give me a second. -[Lucas] Yeah. -Hey, Anna. Do you have a to-go order for Lucas? -Hi. -Hey. Thought I scared you off the other day. No. Yeah, maybe a little bit. Hey, do you like bowling? Yeah. Yeah. Who doesn't like bowling? Wanna go sometime? Yeah, how about tonight? Oh, um, I'm sorry, tonight won't work. My son, I-I don't have a sitter. But, um, maybe-- I can babysit. There you go. She can babysit. [Katie chuckles] So, how about eight o'clock? -Yeah, eight o'clock's good. -He wasn't asking you. [laughs] Um, how about you just give me your number? -I'll give you a call. -Sure. Cool. See you tonight? -Yeah. See you later. -All right. -Bye. -Thanks. -Hey... -[chuckling] Very funny. Listen, I'm gonna get out of here. Is that cool with you? Gonna go get pretty for your date? [chuckles] No, I'm going to pick up Danny. You're welcome. [cell phone ringing] -[Katie] Mom? -You were right, Katie. I underestimated him. -What happened? -[Evelyn] He was here. -Where? -In my house. He knows about Danny. He saw a picture on my fridge. -Katie. -I'm here. I'm so sorry. It's fine, I... I knew this would happen at some point. Does he know where I live? He took the envelope you sent. So he knows the general area. -What are you gonna do? -I don't know. -Maybe I'll move again. -You can't do that. Danny just started school. -Did he hurt you? -No. I'm fine. He just scared me. Katie, how much longer can you keep running? As long as I have to. Why aren't you returning my calls? -I don't wanna speak to you. -Did you go to the police? No. Did you get rid of the body? Look, I'm sorry you got mixed up in my business, but at least now you know the truth. What is the truth, Nick? What are you, some kind of gangster? Hey, I told you. I make loans for some very powerful people who depend on my efficiency and discretion. You lied to me about everything. I don't trust you. I know you, Katie. You don't mean that. No, no, I'm sorry, this, this isn't gonna work. I don't think we should see each other again. I can't lose you. Baby, you are everything to me. Not anymore. -I decide when this is over. -Let go of my arm! -Don't test me, Katie. -Don't threaten me. You know what, I will go to the police. -I wouldn't do that. -Why not? Because I will destroy everything-- everything you love. -I don't believe you. -Yeah? No? I don't make empty threats. Believe that. Let go of my arm, you're hurting me! I'm sorry. I won't hurt you, baby. I love you. You're out of your mind, you know that? -This isn't love. -Where are you going? You'll never get away from me, Katie, never. Do you hear me? You will never get away from me! I will find you wherever you go! I will find you! -[door thuds] -[gasps] So remember I was telling you about dodgeball and everyone ganged up on me? Well, today I was the last one standing. I was, like, the king of dodgeball. Mom? Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie, I... I have a lot on my mind, okay? -Did something happen? -No, no, I just... I got into a small disagreement with your grandmother. -That's all. -Oh. I wish I could meet her. You will someday. It's a promise. Hey, Danny, what would you say about us moving somewhere new? But I just started school. I know. [sighs] Why do you wanna move? Uh, I, um, I got a new job offer in another city. What kind of job? Uh, an office job. -Is that better? -Well, it's more money. But... why? I don't wanna move! It's not fair! Okay, okay, calm down. I was just asking. You don't have to get all crazy. Well, you make me crazy. [Katie clicks tongue, sighs] Danny, what's the matter? What, are you not talking to me now? Why don't you wash your hands, okay? Dinner's gonna get cold. -I'm not hungry. -Danny. [Chloe] Hello! Lucas. [sighs] [Chloe] Where's the little guy? I brought flour and all the stuff to make cookies. Bet it'd be fun for Danny since his mama never cooks. [sighs] Yeah. Aren't you gonna change for your date? -I'm sorry. I'm not going. -What are you talking about? I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood to go on a date. I should have called you. I-I apologize. What are you doing? -Making an excuse. -No, you're not. Can you give me back my phone, please? No, you're being totally rude. Chloe, this is really none of your business. Yeah, it is my business. I helped you set up the date, and... [sighs] And I'm your friend and I don't want to see you self-sabotage. Look, you don't understand. Then explain it to me. [Katie sighs] I was in a really bad relationship a few years ago. -Danny's father? -Yeah. He was abusive. It was really bad and... and now he's resurfaced and he is harassing my mom... God, it's a nightmare. Is that why you moved here? To escape this guy? Yes. Okay. I get it. Yeah, there's a lot of, lot of bad guys out there... but I don't think that Lucas is one of them. He seems like a good guy. And I think that we should reward the good ones, don't you? Do the right thing. You know you want to. [rock music playing] [Lucas] Um, I can't believe you beat me twice, I-- -I killed you. -It's embarrassing. -I mean-- -I know people here. -You know, Danny likes to bowl. -Hm. -So I get a lot of practice. -Hm. -[chuckles] -I bet. -So how'd you guys end up here? -[clears throat] I don't know, we... We needed a change, you know? -What about you? -[Lucas chuckles] -You do that a lot. -What? You give a vague answer to me and then bounce the question right back at me. -It's kind of your thing. -Okay. Sorry. [laughs] I guess I do do that. [laughs] Um... I haven't been on a date in a while, so... It's okay. I-I'm rusty, too. [chuckles] I'll go first, uh... I grew up in this sleepy town. And I moved to Brooklyn and opened up a store. -What kind of store? -Uh, watch repair. -[Katie] Oh, wow. -Yeah. That's beautiful. It's really nice, it's like, it's like art deco. -Yeah. -That style. No one's ever gotten that before. -I like it. Nice. -Yeah. Thank you. -Did you like Brooklyn? -I don't know. Honestly, uh, everyone there is, like, tryin' to be so authentic, it just feels inauthentic. Yeah. Yeah. No, I know what you mean. Are you in touch with Danny's father at all? -Y'all talk? -No. No. What about you? You want kids? You're doin' it again. -What? -Deflecting. You're right. Listen, I don't wanna talk about Danny's father. Is that okay? Of course. And, yes. I do wanna have kids. But I don't know if I'm ready yet. You're never ready, you know? It just happens. I did have a girlfriend in Brooklyn. Oh? -She was a dancer. -Oh. Gorgeous, talented, smart. We were practically living together. Uh-huh. But I had two roommates, so it was, it was tricky. And, uh, she got pregnant. And... everything changed. I mean, suddenly I couldn't just live in the moment, I was thinking about the next 18 years. I was thinking about being a dad-- And she had the baby? Yeah, she did. You left her? I did. Missed this town, I guess. What about your kid? It wasn't my kid. -What? -It was my roommate's. [gasps] -I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. -Yeah. They would hook up while I was asleep. Oh... [inhales sharply] That's rough. -I'm-I'm sorry. -Yeah. Yeah, it was pretty humiliating. -Uh... -Wow. But it was also a bit of relief, you know? Hm. Can I make an observation about you? Sure. You are way too sophisticated to be working as a waitress. -[laughs] No, I'm not. -Yeah. Look, I don't mind it, you know? I mean, it's a job. It's not like I'm independently wealthy or anything. What if you were? I mean, if you could do anything, what would you do? I don't know, maybe I'd be... curator at an art museum. Or, um, I'd own my own gallery. -Wow. -Yeah. -Those sound like city jobs. -I guess. -So I'll ask you again. -Mm-hmm? What are you doing in this Podunk town? Beating your country ass at bowling, that's what. [laughs] You know what? One more game. -Oh, yeah? -Put your shoes back on. -One more game. -Okay. One more chance to redeem yourself. How about that? -That's all I need. -One more chance. This is my home turf, right? -I got to defend it. -[laughing] So, you always wait till the third game to, like, pull out all the stops? -That's right. -To impress the ladies? That's when I turn it on. -Is that right? -Yeah. You're gonna kick my ass at putt-putt next time? [laughs] I might. They used to call me the putt-putt queen. Oh, really? You have a really nice smile. Thank you. [instrumental music] [chatter, laughter] I used to be a master. -We'd make out... -Oh, yeah? ...after the bowling. -And unbutton the, uh... -Yeah. [laughs] On the first kiss? Maybe we should just save that for another time. Hm? There gonna be another time? There might be... if you play your cards right. -Ahh. -If I'm still in town. You planning on leaving town? I like to keep my options open. You are an enigma. Just private. Wanna go back to my house? We don't have to do anything. Well, as long as you have a cute roommate, I'm totally down. -[chuckles] -I... -Too soon? -Yeah. Too soon. [exhales] No, listen, I would love to hang out more, I just... I should get going, you know? I, uh, left Danny with Chloe, so... -You don't trust her? -No, she's great. I just... I worry. Okay. One more. -[Katie] One more? -Yeah, maybe two more. [Chloe] You need to go to bed, little man. Your mom would kill me if she knew that you were still up. I think I ate too many cookies. Ugh, me, too. Hey, do you know my dad? No. Your mom doesn't like to talk about him very much. And I'm sure that there's a good reason for that. Well, he is my dad. I'd like to meet him. You are lucky that you have a mom that loves you so much. [dramatic music] I didn't meet my dad until I was a teenager. And trust me, I was not missing much. What's wrong? There's a man out there. [Chloe] Where? There was a man looking into the window. [knocking on door] -Who is that? -Danny, uh... -why don't you go to your room? -But-- Danny. Just do it. [Danny groans] [knocking on door] [banging on door] [intense music] [banging on door] [banging on door] -Who is it? -[Leon] It's me. What the... You're stalking me now? You don't return my phone calls. I don't wanna talk to you, duh! -Why are you holding a knife? -You scared the crap out of me. Sorry. Can we just talk for a minute? No. You shouldn't be here. Okay. I admit it. I-I flirt with other women. Okay... why? Because it feels good. And how do you think that makes me feel? I know it's wrong, but it ain't like I'm gonna go do anything with them. Yeah, but you're my boyfriend, you shouldn't even be thinking about other women. I'm not! Well, not s-seriously. You're the only woman I want. I mean, I'm not out there stalking them. Am I? That is strangely logical. You miss me. -Admit it. -I'm still holding a knife. -You need to leave. -Call me. [owl hoots] [Chloe humming] [both gasping] Are you okay? I'm sorry. [laughing] I'm sorry. So? [sighs] It was fun. [chuckles] He's a good guy. Did you kiss him? [chuckles] Come on. You like him. Look how flushed you are. I just, I don't know if it's the right time for a relationship. -How's Danny? -Good. We had a visitor. -Leon. -Oh. I'll tell you about it later. Danny asked about his father, though. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna have to tell him the truth at some point. Yeah. Sooner rather than later. He's a bright kid. Not much gets past him. All right, I'm gonna leave you this mess. -Okay. Thank you so much. -You're welcome. -Goodnight. Mwah. -You're the best. -All right, bye! -Have a nice night. Bye. [instrumental music] [music continues] Hey. What's wrong? I'm pregnant. It's Nick's. Now what am I gonna do? I... You know, I-I feel so trapped. He's never gonna let me go now. [whimpering] You don't have to keep it. I know. I know, I... I mean, I want to... You know, I want to protect it. He's gonna find out, Katie. [dramatic music] M-My life is over. -What am I gonna do? -No, don't say that. I wish I could just disappear, you know? -How? -I don't know, I... I just feel like my life would be so much easier if I was someone else. Can I tell you something in confidence? Do you know how Sergei managed to defect from Russia? How? He forged his own documents. A passport and a work visa. Otherwise he would have never gotten out. [Sergei] Name? I'm sorry, what? What'd you say? -What name are you using? -Um, um... Oh, shit, I haven't thought about that, um... -I guess something simple-- -I need it, now. Um...Anna. Anna... Jones. You shall be. [dramatic music] [kiss] [dramatic music] Hi, guys. How's everything over here? [woman] Good. [music continues] [woman] Did you hear me? Miss? I-I'm sorry. What? -We're ready to order. -Uh, of course, yes. -What can I get for you? -Um... I would like a glass of wine. Uh, red or white? -How about rosé? -Rosé. What, are you still angry with me? Are we moving away? [sighs] I don't know yet. [dramatic music] What do you keep looking at? Nothing, I just... I-I keep thinking I'm seeing the same car. [heavy sigh] Goodnight, Mom. [dramatic music] -You guys back together? -We'll see. He's making dinner for me and Kayla tonight. Oh. That's nice. She's with him this week? Wait, what time is it? Oh, I gotta go pick up Danny. Um... I'm sorry. Do you mind finishing up for me? Yeah. You owe me. [mutters] [dramatic music] [line out ringing] [line out ringing] [ringing] [Voicemail] Hello, this is Principal Anderson. Please leave a message. Hi, um, hello, this is Anna. Anna Jones. I'm-I'm Danny's mother. Um, listen. I am running a few minutes late, but, um... [sighs] if you could just make sure that someone keeps an eye on Danny, uh, okay? It's very important that he's not left alone. Please. I will be there very soon. Thank you. [beep] Danny. Mom's runnin' late. Hop in. Who are you? You don't recognize me? I'm your father. [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] -[bolts clattering] -What's going on? [exhales] Someone slashed my tire. [Chloe] What kind of jerk would do that? You think he's here? -Who? -None of your business. I gotta get to Danny before he does. -Let me do it. -No, no. I-I got it. No, really, let him. He's a machine. My mom doesn't like me eating fast food. Uh-huh? Good thing I'm not your mom. Does she know you're here? No. I wanted to surprise her. She doesn't like surprises. She once told me if anyone ever tries to have a surprise party, I should tell her immediately. All right. Well, I think she'll like this one. So, what's your mom told you about me? She said that you were in the military on a secret mission. Is that true? Yup. I just got back. How come you never call us? We're not allowed to, pal. Like your mom said, secret mission. Do you think about me? Hey... Every day. Where d-- Where did you get that? Your mom sent it. [dramatic music] Danny? Danny? Danny? Hi, hi. Have you guys seen Danny? Do you know Danny? No? Danny! Danny! Come on! Danny! Unhhh! Damnit! [sobbing] [mumbles] [starts car] Come on, pal. Hi! Room for the night, please. Seventy-nine dollars. -We're spending the night? -Yeah. -It'll be fun, pal. -Who's this little fella? -I'm Danny. -He's my son. Where's your mama, Danny? She's at home, I think... -What's she doing at home? -[Nick] Hey. You mind? I've been driving all day, I really want to lie down. You want a cot for Danny? [Nick] Do you have double beds? [Maggie] Twenty dollars extra. And I'll need to see some ID. [laughs] Unreal. Okay, have a good look. There you go. What do you think, huh? Could we hurry this along maybe? Will you be requiring extra towels? Two will suffice. Are we done? Checkout is 11 a.m. We don't do late checkout. Room 209, second level. -You want a dollar? -Thanks. Thanks. [Nick] Put it in the soda machine or somethin'. [Danny] Can I call my mom? [door latches] [Nick] Not yet, I told you. It'll ruin the surprise. [Danny] She's gonna be mad. [Nick Yeah, well, tell you what, let's get settled, then you can call. You take that bed. I don't have my toothbrush. -[Nick] It's okay. -I can't brush my teeth. Hey, you can go one night without brushing your teeth, they're not gonna fall out. Are you really my father? Of course I am. [instrumental music] [cell phone ringing] -Hello. -[Nick] Hello, Katie. It's so good to hear your voice. Eight years is a long time, especially when spent in a six-by-nine room with nothing to do but think. Nick, I had nothing to do with you going back to prison. Oh, I know, Katie. You were dead. [Katie] What have you done to my son? Don't you mean our son? He's not your son. We both know he's mine. Why didn't you tell me we had a child? Oh, that's right, you were too busy being dead. Let me speak to him. God, he must be scared out of his mind. He's fine. [Katie] What do you want, Nick? -I wanna get to know my son. -[Katie] Yeah, yeah. You didn't have to kidnap him to do that. [Nick] It's not kidnapping. He came willingly. Bring him back to me now! [Nick] Or what? What are you gonna do, Katie? -I'll call the police. -Oh, you will? I would love, love, to see how that plays out. -Is that my mother? -Danny? Danny? Nick, Nick, put him on the phone. Please, please let me speak to him. Careful what you say, Katie. -Mom? -Oh, my God. Sweetie? It's so good to hear your voice. [Danny] Mom, I want to come home. I know you do. I-I don't have my toothbrush. I can't brush my teeth. [chuckles] You can brush them twice when you come home. Mom, I don't wanna sleep here. Sleep? Sleep. Uh, honey, where are you? Nice try, Katie. Something you don't understand here, Katie-pie. You don't control this situation. Not anymore. Nick? Nick? God! What? I don't like the way you talk to her. [scoffs] We fight sometimes. All couples do. When can I go home? You're not going home, pal. You're coming to Los Angeles with me. -But I don't wanna go! -You don't have a choice. Back inside. Let's be clear about something. I make the rules, you follow 'em. Understood? [cell phone ringing] Nick? Oh, hi, Lucas. Listen, this is, um, this is really not a great time to talk, okay? I can't. Hey. Thank you. -Why don't you sit down, too? -I-I can't. I'm... I'm sorry, I'm too wound up. This is about Danny's father, isn't it? Yeah. He has Danny. -Does he have visitation rights? -No, it's... It's a long story. Hey. Come on. Start at the beginning. Yeah? Yeah, I worked at this art gallery... [continues, indistinct] [continues, indistinct] Are you judging me? No. No. I just... How did you do it? How did you fake your suicide? [Katie] I left my car on a bridge. It was the middle of the night. I left my... purse and my ID on the car seat. It was my... first chance at freedom, you know? He was never gonna let me go. And you were pregnant with Danny this whole time? Yeah. That was the only real positive, you know? I mean... Danny never felt like a mistake. He was my first... real piece of a new life. That means... Nick didn't know that he had a son? No, he didn't know. You think that's fair? I wasn't thinking about what was fair. I was thinking about surviving. And protecting my son. Do you know, shortly after I found out that he was sent to prison on an extortion charge? I looked into the case, you know. He got off so easy. Murders were happening all over, and the DA couldn't pin it on anyone. I-I have no idea what kind of business he was involved in, but it was clear that these, these killings, these murders were not gonna stop. Look, look, all I'm saying... all I'm saying, is it-- is it possible... that he just wants to get to know his son? [scoffs] No. No, that's not it. You have no idea how capable this guy is. Okay? I mean, after-- after everything I did, after how careful I was, he still found me. And now it's like he just wants to punish me. He's like--it's like if he can't have me, he just wants to destroy me. We need to go to the police. You need to tell them all of this. I can't. I don't think you have any other choice. Excuse me, sir. Um... I need to report a missing child. [intense music] [music intensifies] [doorbell buzzes, door opens] [door closes] I couldn't go through with it. He literally got away with murder. You know? A-And I've been the one committing fraud here. [sighs] Jesus, I... I left behind student loans, uh, unpaid credit cards, a whole city searching for my body. You know, they could see it as a case where I kidnapped my own son and I kept him on the run just-just to prevent him from meeting his own father. I'd look like the guilty one. If the police find out who I am, what are they gonna do? What are they gonna do to Danny? They're gonna put him in the system? Or worse yet, they're gonna, they're gonna give custody over to Nick? -Just take me home. -Hey, it's... Just, please, take me home. It's okay. Okay. [owl hoots] [footsteps treading] [intense music] Danny? Danny? Sweetie? Danny? [music continues] Sweetie. [whispers] Danny. Oh, God. Oh. Oh, Danny. Oh, sweetie. -Mommy? -Oh, sweetie. I was so worried about you. What happened? What happened? He let you go? Mommy, I'm scared. No, it's okay, sweetie. You're safe, okay? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. He's here. [banging on door] [pounding on door] [panting] Hey. -You okay? -Yeah. Just... had a bad dream. Oh. [intense music] [door latch clanking] [clanking continues] Can I help you with something? I need to call my mom. Are you in some kind of trouble, kid? [telephone ringing] Front desk. Maggie speaking. I'm calling from room 209. You happen to see my son? No, I haven't. Let me know if he turns up? [Maggie] Of course. What's your mother's number? Danny! Where are you, pal? Come on, you should eat something. [cell phone ringing] -Hello? -[Danny on phone] Mom? Oh, God. Oh, God. Thank God. -Danny, where are you? -I'm in a motel. -[Katie on phone] Where's Nick? -Upstairs. Danny, where is this motel? It's next to a big road. -A highway. -D-do you know the name of it? -I don't know. -Okay. Well, is there an adult there? There's a lady at the desk here. Let me speak to her. She wants to speak with you. [Maggie] This is Maggie. Front desk. Maggie. Maggie, listen. My son, Danny, he is in danger. Okay? The man he is with, his father, he doesn't have good intentions. How can I help you? Uh, what's the name of this motel? W-Where is it? [Maggie] Highway Inn, off Route 46. Highway Inn, Route 46? -Fifteen minutes. -Okay, okay. Maggie, listen. I'm gonna be there to pick him up soon. Can-Can you just watch him? Just keep him safe for 15 minutes? [Maggie] Your husband, I see him on the monitor. He's on his way down here. No, no, no, no. Can you tell Danny to hide? -He's gone. -What?! Gone? Where-Where did he go? [Nick] Danny! Hey, Danny! This isn't a game! [intense music] [keyboard keys clacking] [ringing] -Yes? -Hi, hi, I am so sorry. I didn't see you standing right there. Are you sure you haven't seen my boy? I'm sure. Don't you got security cameras back there? -I've been busy. -Ah. [Nick] Then how did that get back there? -What? -My son's backpack. Where is he? Are you hiding him back there? Don't you dare come back here! Where's my son? You want me to call the police? This isn't over. [intense music] Have you seen a little boy? Oh... No, sir, I haven't. Could he be in one of these rooms? -Why? -He likes to play hide and seek. -All the rooms are locked. -I need to see inside. -He's my son. -I can't do that. You should speak to the front office. She doesn't like me very much. Tell you what. Would you show me? Lucas, you really don't have to come with me. Come on. We're in this together. Okay, well, can you move your truck? -Let's just take it. -Wait. Danny won't recognize it. Yeah, well, neither will Nick. What if this is a trap? What if he wants you to come to this place? Okay. You're right. Can you drive? -Yes. -[cell phone ringing] [gasps] Hello? -[Danny on phone] It's me. -Danny? Oh, my God! Thank God. Are you okay? -I'm in a motel room. -[Katie] Where's Nick? -Right outside. -Are you safe, honey? I don't know. I snuck in here. [sighs] Good boy. -Did he hurt you? -No. He wants to take me away. T-Take you away? Where, where? What?! No! No, do not go with him. Do you understand me? -I can't talk, Mom. -Okay. Okay, honey, I love you. I-I'll be there soon. -Same place? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sir, please, you're gonna get me into trouble. -Show me the next room. -I'll be fired. I-- [Nick] I don't care! Danny! It's gonna be okay. -Just please drive faster. -Okay. [intense music] [door beeps] Danny? [Nick] Danny! Come on, Danny! Game's over! Where are ya? You're gonna have to leave. -You're disrupting the guests. -Oh, yeah? You have a child missing on the premises. Maybe you should be more concerned with that, grandma. The sheriff is on his way. [Katie] Where is he? Where is he? I don't see him. Here. Stop right here. Stop right here. -Come with you? -Stay in the car. Keep the car running, okay? Danny? Danny? Sweetie? Honey, you can hear me? Sweetie, it's your mom, sweetie. [Danny] Mom? [Katie] Oh! Baby! -Come here. -Mom! All right. -Lucas. -Hey, guys, come on, come on. Here, here, get in. Get in. [Nick] Hey! Hey! [intense music] [tires screeching] Hands up! Or I'll blow your brains out. Lucas, are you seeing this? -Do you want me to go back? -No. No, no, no. She's got it. Baby. Oh, God. Are you okay? Hey, buddy, you did a good job back there. What now, Maggie? We are gonna wait for the sheriff. Yeah? I think I'm gonna pass. [Nick] I wouldn't do that if I were you. Have a nice life, grandma. Sweetie, wait. Are you okay? -We're fine. Thank you. -Let's get him inside. Listen, I'm just gonna run in, grab some bags and then we're gonna go. Thank you. -Well, I'll come with you. -Danny. Run in to the house, okay? Run to your room. I've packed you a bag. I'll be in a second, sweetie. Look, I know you're trying to help, but honestly... You're not listening to me. We're going, too. -Plus, you're blocking my car. -Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait. -Where are you gonna go? -I don't know. Look, I know you're trying to help, but honestly, I gotta go. -Hold up. -He can be here any second. -Take this. -[gasps] What? -Just to protect him. -No. Look, I know you care about me, but I don't wanna drag you into this. And I certainly don't want a gun. Look, we don't have time to talk about this right now, okay? Thank you for everything. Danny? We gotta go. Come on. Give me your bag. Okay. Get in the car, sweetie. Danny, go and get inside the house, okay? Hey, babe. Aren't you even gonna say hi? Where are you going? Come on! Um... Okay, listen. I want you to go to your room, lock the door, don't let anyone in, okay? Do you understand me? Okay. [Nick] Let me in. What are you gonna do? Where you gonna go? [music continues] Katie! Come on, Katie, this is silly. I just wanna talk! Maybe I'll go back to the house to get Danny. -Boy needs a father. -Hey! You stay away from him. [music continues] [grunts] It's no use, Katie. Nowhere left to run. Come on, Nick, what are you gonna do? -What, are you gonna kill me? -Why not? -You're already dead. -Don't do this. Shut up! You are so dumb. You made it so easy for me. Erased your identity, isolated yourself. -I'll just take Danny. -Don't do this. It'll be like you never existed. Don't do this. -Nick! Nick! Nick! -[grunts] [Katie gasps] Lucas? Lucas, be careful! Lucas! -[groans] -[Katie] No! Oh! Stop! Luc-- Anna, get out of here. Oh! -[revolver cocks] [Katie] Nick! I know you, Katie. You're too good of a person to shoot me. My name...is Anna now. [intense music] [birds chirping] [Katie] Hi, Mom. You made it. [laughs] You're crushing me. [Evelyn] Ah, I'm never gonna let you go. Danny, this is your granny. Come here, angel. Give me a hug. Oh! Is this Lucas? You didn't tell me how handsome he is. [laughs] Lucas, this is my mom, Evelyn. Hi. I got a hug for ya. Oh. Thank you so much for taking care of my family. I hope to do it for a while. -Your house smells good. -Oh. That's because I baked you a big birthday cake. -But it's not my birthday today. -Well, I know. But I've missed eight of them already. We have a lot of catching up to do. Come on. You know, we gotta make up for a lot of lost time, too. Yes. [chuckles] [instrumental music] [Katie] Oh, my gosh. Mom, look at all these presents! [rock song playing]
