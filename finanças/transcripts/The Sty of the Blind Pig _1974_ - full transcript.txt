Ain't aiding and abetting nobody in gambling. What you looking for? - Whiskey. - Whiskey, lord. I'm surrounded by whiskey heads. Keep on and you gonna be that drunken fool set to death. - That's what my wife Norli used to say. Foxley honey, you gonna keep on drinking that whiskey 'til it kills ya. I told her I'd be drinking whiskey when the railroad track was running on by here. She been dead 20 years now. - You gonna have to give an account of that old random talk when Jesus gets back and looks up your record. - I'm almost 60. He ain't made it back there since I been here, and I'm beginning to think maybe he ain't coming back. Can't say I blame him after the royal beating he got the last time he was here. What the? Hey you chaps, get your butts off of my car before I come down there and locate my stick in the vicinity of your hindquarters! - Don't holler out my window. - Never seen nothing like these chaps in all my-- - I don't reckon they ever seen anything like you before either, dressed like that, driving that old car, walking around here in warm weather with gloves on. I told you men don't wear gloves no more! - Second time today somebody mentioned my gloves. - Will you please not write your numbers in my house?

Don't reckon somebody done hit her over the head and dragged her into one of them deserted dens. - Sound like some of Mama's ol' random talk. - Mama had second sight. Maybe Alberta run off like her no-good father. That's what Gardner Warren did, just walked out of here one evening. - A non-smoker who went out for the famous pack of cigarettes and ain't been heard from since. Always did like old Gardner Warren. Used to love to watch that man eat fish. Never saw anything like it in my life. The man would put fish in one side of his mouth, work his lips, and the bone would shoot out on the other side. Yes sir, it was like watching a machine. - Hello Mama. Uncle Doc. - Hi Alberta. - What are you two sitting up here in the dark for? - [Weedy] Waitin' on you. - Waitin' on me for what? - I told you this morning 'fore you went to work that brother would be by this evening to take us to church. - Didn't you hear me tell you this morning that I wasn't going to church this evening? - Sister Martin's sitting down at Mount Hope this very minute waiting on you to give you the information. - Did you tell that woman I was gonna write her son's obituary? I don't know why in the world you keep telling people that I'm gonna write their obituaries for them. - Can't nobody write 'em like you can. Everybody say that. Folks still talkin' 'bout the one you wrote and recited for Emmanuel Fisher. - I threw that away. - [Weedy] You threw Emmanuel Fisher's obituary away? - Didn't I just say I did? - You mean you didn't keep a copy of it? - What does throw it away mean? - But you can remember how it went and write it out, can't ya? - I have erased it from my mind. - Why? - Because I didn't want to remember it. - Bet you could if you put your mind to it. What'd you call it? - [Alberta] The Flight of the Purple Angels. - Tell brother how it went. - It was about the purple angels coming to take him home. Coming to take him to the land of glory. - Alberta just got carried away, didn't you Alberta? - Mama, you're gonna be late for church. - Yeah you're holding me up. - Brother ain't never heard it, do it for brother. - Mama, will you please go to church? - [Doc] Come on Weedy, be going. - If you're still up when I get back, Mama will bring you some ice cream.

I ain't even sure she live in this building. - Well how you gonna-- - I know she lives somewhere on State Street in Chicago, so I've been going from building to building, door to door inquiring about her. - Grace Waters? I don't know anybody offhand by that name in this building. She could be rooming. What does she look like? Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh you don't have to be sorry, ma'am. I'm used to it, I've been blind a long time. It's part of my name, Blind Jordan. I don't reckon you've heard of me up here, but down home I'm known all the way from East St. Louis to New Orleans. Ma'am, I was wondering, would you mind giving me a glass of water? - Surely. - Well thank you, ma'am. I was just about dried up. Somehow I can't seem to get used to this Chicago water. Takes a little while I reckon. - Here you are. - Thank you ma'am. You like music, ma'am? - Oh yes, I like music. - Sure would like to play you a tune. - I'd like to hear you, but there's no one here but me. - Oh I don't mean you no harm ma'am, no harm in this world. - I'm not afraid, Mr. Jordan. - Thought I'd play you a little tune in exchange for something to eat. - Are you hungry, Mr. Jordan? - Ma'am I'm so hungry 'til I am weak. - Oh come on into the kitchen. - Could you direct me? - Oh, certainly. Oh let me move some of this stuff out of your way. - What's this? - Just something I made. - Crepe paper flower? - You know about crepe paper flowers, Mr. Jordan? - Yes, made out of colored crepe paper and paste with pieces of wire for the stem. Down home folks don't always have money to buy real flowers, so they make their own. I never liked 'em, same with artificial fruit. Oh I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean to belittle your gift. - I'd hardly call it a gift, Mr. Jordan. Now let me see what's in here. - Oh, anything will do me ma'am. You don't have to put yourself out none whatsoever for me. Leftovers or something will suit me just fine. - I'll make you a sandwich, some milk. - Oh thank you, ma'am.

Used to be a lot of blind street singers in them days. Now there's only a few of us left. All passed on with the coming of the piccolo. - How did you get here, to Chicago? - Part by car, part by foot. You just follow directions and start putting one foot in front of the other. - How long have you been looking for her? Grace Waters? - A long time. Sometimes it seems I ain't never not been looking for her. Well, I reckon I'd better be getting along. - Oh let me get my coat and I'll help you down the stairs. - Oh no, no thank you ma'am.

Every single car was packed with his family. - Isaiah didn't have a load, we could've rode with him. - Mama, I asked him. Said he'd be glad to drive us up but that we'd have to find another way back. - [Weedy] Could've caught the bus. - You know how long it takes to get back from that cemetery by bus. We'd be all night getting back here. - They sure did a good job on him. Looked just like he did in life. I remember when you and him was in the sunshine band. - I don't remember him being in the sunshine band. - You don't remember being in the sunshine band with AJ Martin? - I don't remember ever seeing him before today. - The way you and him used to play together round the church when you was little. - Funny I can't remember him. But he sure was a nice looking man. - Oh AJ Martin was a fine looking man. - Who was that calling out for him? Kept screaming his name. - That was Lettie Wentworth. She was crazy about him. Hadn't been for sister Martin, I think AJ might have married her. She sure did perform this day. She really put on a show. - The way she was carrying on I thought he was going to raise up in that casket. (laughing) - She just showed out, just showed out! And the way you read that obituary. You had that whole church stirred up. One woman just fell out and went to kicking. Another one leaped up and danced the dance of happiness. There wasn't a soul in that church that wasn't touched by the Holy Ghost. And the way you read them. I tell you Alberta, it was something to behold. You got a gift, honey, a calling. Yes lord. You like scared me to death though when you fell out the pulpit like you done. You almost fell in the casket, fainting like that. Sure scared me. You shouldn't be drinking that whiskey! - I need something for my nerves. - [Weedy] That's what's giving you them fainting spells! - I didn't have a fainting spell. - The ushers had to come and revive you! Keep on drinking that whiskey. - I just lost my balance and fell. - Did you drink any of that whiskey before you went to the funeral? - My nerves were bad. - You mean you was up in the church, standing in the pulpit, drunk as a skunk? - I was not drunk. I just had a little taste. - No wonder you didn't want to go to the cemetery. Glad now we didn't go! Folks find out you was drunk. Oh lord, the child is turning into a whiskey head. A whiskey head! - I am not a whiskey head, and I wasn't drunk at the funeral. - Then how come you fall out for dead? - I don't know, I just got weak all over, started having heat flashes. - Heat flashes? - Shh! Don't talk so loud. - Don't talk so loud? - The walls have ears! - What do you mean the walls have ears? - It's just that someone, someone may be listening to us. - Nobody's listening to us. - Wait a minute, just a minute.

Ain't a soul out there. - I thought I heard something. - [Weedy] Why don't you go lay down for a little while? - No I don't want to lay down. - Just for a half hour. - No I don't want to lay down! - Well don't carry on so. - Just leave me alone, please! - You're not gonna drink any more of that whiskey! - Mama please!

Why has she scratched the labels off the bottles? - Maybe she figured you'd be rambling around in her room. - I don't know why she'd think that. She ain't never caught me rambling around in her room. Pink pills. Lord, what's a child doing with so many pink pills? - If the voice of the lord came out of the wall and told ya, I bet you'd break your neck getting out of here. - Brother, I need you to help me. - I ain't putting in no numbers for ya. You'll have to do that yourself. - I'll just wait 'til you get through cutting a fool. - All right, Weedy. - I want you to help me to find out what doctor she's going to. - Why don't you just ask her? - If she intended for me to know, don't you think she'd have told me by now? - If she intended for you to know, I reckon she would have. - She goes to the doctor on Saturday, and next Saturday you could be parked out there and follow her. - Spy on her? Just what are you planning on paying for this service? - Hello Mama, Uncle Doc. How did my medicine get out here? - Well I was just showing brother how appetizing they're making medicine these days, wasn't I brother? - Stop spying on me. - Ain't nobody spying on you, crazy woman. Who you think is interested in your medicine? And you needn't be scratching the labels off the bottle so I won't know who your doctor is. - Ma that's why you went rambling through my things! You in on this too? - I was just being recruited by the secret service detail to trail ya. - Will you please not ask people to spy on me? - I ain't asking nobody to spy on you. - Didn't you ask me to-- - Will you shut up? Have you taken complete loss of your mind? Before long the men in the white coats will be on your tail, carrying you off to the Canker Key Insane Asylum. - Why don't you call in the police? Send a letter to Mr. Hoover! You better stop it Mommy, you just better stop. One day I swear to God I'll walk out of here and never look back. - Will you please not take the lord's name in vain in my presence? You sound like a street woman. - You have tried my patience these 30 odd years. Eating up the food I buy, sleeping out the bedclothes I have to buy, and on top of that you hassled me out of what little mind I have left. - Just let me straighten out your behind before it goes too far. I don't have to stay here and take this kind of abuse. Before I'll take abuse from a child I birthed into the world, I'll pick manure with the birds! Don't have to stay here and take this kind of talk. - What's she doing? - Getting her suitcase. - She moving again? - Uh-huh. - I've got too much grit in my craw to stay anywhere where I ain't wanted. - Where you going this time? - Anywhere away from here. Before I'll stay where I ain't wanted, I'll take up residence in an old folks home. - You'd worry those folks to death. - Just because I'm concerned about your health, there's no reason for you to mistreat me. I never spoke a harsh word to my mother the longest day she walked this earth. Spying on you. You have not heard me say a single solitary thing about spying on you. Have you heard me utter a half a syllable about spying on you? But if you want to listen to the random talk of folks what's fugitives from the authorities of the Canker Key Insane Asylum, you go right ahead! Don't worry about me none. 'Cause I got grit in my craw. Always did have it. I give you up into the hands of the lord, for I have fought the good fight. Now if you wanna go sneaking off to the doctor, and not tell nobody about the nature of your complaint, ain't nothing I can do. If you don't tell me, your own mother, what underwent the pains of death to bring you into this world, who struggled with you when your old father walked off and left you without a crust of bread on which to exercise your stomach muscles, who worked like a very dog to put shoes on your feet, and give you a place to lay your head! That's why I keep having this hurting in my side now. Working myself to death, supporting folks. When I close my eyes in death, you'll realize that I was the best thing you ever had. - Goodbye, Mama. - All right. (laughing) - Where you think she'll go? - Around the corner to have some ice cream with some chocolate syrup on it. - You know what you oughta do? You oughta run like hell, run like the building's on fire. Run to parts unknown, satchel up. Go and leave if you've gotta leave here walking. - Run, run where? - What about Mrs. Catrell? Ain't they been after you to stay on the place? - Yes. - Get a day off, come and see Weedy. - Mrs. Catrell is almost as bad as Mama. She works my tongue out now and I know what she'd do if I was living there. I hear on the phone not talking about me. Promising people to loan me out to them like I was some kind of a thing. I don't know what she and Mr. Catrell think I am, telling me I'm a member of the family. Just like one of the family? What I oughta do is one night after I fix dinner is sit down with them at the table, see if they'll let one of the family sit down and eat with 'em. Accusing me of stealing their whiskey. - Thought they gave it to you. - No I steal it, and everything else I can get my hands on that they got. - You keep on, they're gonna have your behind arrested. - Mr. Catrell would never stand for that. He wouldn't have my behind to pinch on anymore. - He does that? - He's been pinching my behind since the first day I walked into that house 15 years ago. - Why that dirty, I wish I could... In the old days down on Beale Street, I used to handle a lot of money, lot of money. Wouldn't have been nothing for me to walk up and hand you a couple hundred. I always kept that kind of money in my pocket. Your old uncle was a legend on that street. Wore a diamond stick pin, pistol in my pocket at all times. Nobody wouldn't dare to mess with none of my kinfolks, I don't care who they was! Because spunky Jimmy Sweet did not take no mess. (knocking) - There's Mama now. She must have forgotten her key. Oh, hi! Come on in. My uncle's here. Mr. Sweet, this is Mr. Jordan. - Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Sweet. - How do you do? - You haven't by any chance heard of a woman by the name of Grace Waters, have you Mr. Sweet? - Grace Waters? - Jordan is looking for her. He came all the way up from the old country searching for her. - Well boss, what country are you from? - Sort of all over. - Grace Waters. No, I don't recollect meeting nobody by that name. You see, Chicago's a big place to be looking for someone unless you know where to put your hands on 'em. - I'll find her. - Well I reckon I better pick up Pearl, told her I'd pick her up after work. Oh, by the way Mr. Jordan, you ain't had any good dreams lately have ya? - You play the numbers, Mr. Sweet? - I've been known to drop a dollar on a figure once in a while. - Try triple zeroes. - Triple zeroes? Sounds good, 'course they all sound good. - You get on it, stay on it. It's gonna fall soon. - How soon? - Well, I can't give you the exact date, but it won't be long. - Okay, I'll put some on it. See you Alberta, see you Mr. Jordan. - [Jordan] Goodbye Mr. Sweet. - I didn't know you'd be around this evening. - Thought I'd get through that big building this evening. The one we stopped at the other day. - It's an awfully big building, Jordan. Might take two or three days to get through it. - I ain't got nothing but time. - [Alberta] And it's Saturday, getting late. Folks don't like to be disturbed on Saturday evening. - Well, they don't have to open the door. All they have to do is say whether or not Grace Waters is living there. - Suppose she was living in that big building. Suppose we knocked on the right door. All she would have to say that she didn't live there and we'd walk right on away. - Oh no, I know her voice too well for that. - Somebody else could answer the door and say she didn't live there. - [Jordan] I come within 100 feet of her, I know it. - Half the buildings around are the order of condemnation. - And that's why I need your help, to point out the ones that still got people living in them. - It's not that I don't want to help you, Jordan. - Are you afraid? - No I'm not afraid. - You think you're not safe with me. You think because of my affliction, you're not safe with me. - Maybe it's just that I'm tired. - I guess it can be exhausting helping me. - Why don't we wait and do it tomorrow? Tomorrow is Sunday. Tomorrow afternoon would be a good day, about the time people get home from church. People are in a good mood then. - I have my mind set on this evening. - Why can't you wait until tomorrow? - And lose a whole day? I don't want to lose a whole day! - All right then, go on! Since you can't wait, you go right ahead and I hope you fall and break your neck. - What? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean that, Jordan. - Oh you're upset. I've done something to you. - No. - Oh what is it? - It's got nothing to do with you. - You wanna tell me? - There's nothing to tell. - Well I reckon I'd better be getting along. - Maybe so. - Oh. - Oh Mama. - I didn't know you had company. - Mama, this is Mr. Jordan. Jordan, this is my mother, Mrs. Vanilla Warren. - Mrs. Warren? - How do you do? - I didn't expect you back so soon. - Just come back for a minute. While waiting for the bus, I had an acute attack of missed meal cramp. Did you ever have an acute attack of a missed meal cramp, Mr. Jordan sir? - Oh yes'm, I've had so many wrinkles in my stomach sometimes I thought it was a prune. - Well, you must stay for supper. - I don't want to put you out none. - Oh, you wouldn't be putting us out none. Come on in the kitchen here. Alberta likes company, don't you Alberta? - How do you think some warmed up pork chops would be? - In this warm weather? My stomach wouldn't have time to settle before my bedtime, and I sure ain't going to bed with no pork unsettled in my stomach. To die during the night with a case of acute indigestion. Jordan sir, did you ever hear of anybody to die from a case of acute indigestion brought on by the eating of pork in warm weather? - Oh yes'm, I knew a man down home once had a nagging wife. Lived about 25 miles down below New Orleans. Well sir, one night in August he fixed that woman some pork chops, and she died that very same night from a case of acute indigestion. 'Course they found out later he had cooked them in lye. - You sure know some strange folks. - Mama, he's joking. - Are you joking me, Mr. Jordan sir? - Tell her you're joking, otherwise she'll swear I'm trying to poison her. - I'm kidding you, Mrs. Warren. - Oh, so you're a kidder Mr. Jordan? Always did like a kidder, yes sir. It's one thing I always did like it was a kidder. How long you been a kidder, Mr. Jordan sir? Remember a man down home once was a kidder. Kidding Sydney they called him. Always liked to kid folks. One day Kidding Sydney kidded the wrong man, and he shot poor Kidding Sydney right dead in the mouth, and Kidding Sydney didn't kid no more. - Suppose I just make some pork and beans. - That's what they feed convicts. - You don't have to fix me nothing, Alberta. - Oh, you're not gonna eat, Mr. Jordan sir? - No ma'am, I reckon I done lost my appetite. I guess I'll be getting along, Alberta. - All right, I'll see you to the door. - Mrs. Warren? I want to thank you kindly for your hospitality. - Goodbye, Mr. Kidder. I mean, Mr. Jordan. - I wish you'd learn how to act nice. - Don't have to learn how to act nice. Ain't running for office, I been elected. - Thought you were hungry. - Oh I reckon I lost my appetite too. Where you going? - Catch some air. - With the blind man? - His name is Jordan, Mama. - Oh I didn't mean no harm. - Maybe I'll take a walk with him. - Sure hate to stay here all by myself. Suppose I had a stroke while you were gallivanting up and down the street? - You're not gonna have a stroke. - How do you know? Is the almighty consulting you about his plans? I could be laying out here with my mouth all twisted up like poor Molly Ross. - Molly Ross? That's Jordan singing. - Yeah down the block, across the street. - Molly Ross? - Died today, poor thing. - I don't think I knew her. - Of course you didn't. Never paid her no attention. She weren't none of your equal. - What did she look like? - Stout woman, walked with a cane. Sure was fat. I never knowed a woman her age that fat before. - Oh that woman. What was her name, Molly Ross? - Sure was a good company keeper. Used to set here and keep me company all day long. - Mama. - Sure was a good company keeper. ♪ I first believed ♪ - Wonder if I should take a coat. - Maybe you oughta, just in case it turns cold. - [Weedy] Generally thirsty weather down there. - This suitcase ain't big enough.

Why don't we just take everything out and pack it in mine? - I don't want that thing.

Take care of some business. - Mama, I don't want to go to the convocation. We can't even afford for you to go. - Convocation's the only little pleasure I get out of life. That and church. - Honey you go on down there and throw it away. We could use that money to fix up this apartment. - What's wrong with this apartment? - Furniture's old, worn out. I'd like to get some new pieces for the living room. - Ain't nothing wrong with this furniture. - It's older than the hills. - It's a whole lot better than the junk they're making today. - At least I could get some slip covers to put over it. That big chair needs to be reupholstered. And the couch, that thing should've been thrown out years ago. - That couch is still good. - While you're gone, I think I'll have somebody come up here and take that thing outta here. - And what are we gonna do for a couch? - [Alberta] I'll try to get a new one. - You just leave this couch right alone. Had this couch before you was born. - The springs are coming through. Every time I sit on it, it sticks right in my behind. - Then keep your behind off of it! I better not come back here and find this couch missing. - [Alberta] Well I'm sure gonna get rid of it. - No you ain't. What got into you? Just gonna throw my stuff out without my permission? - You love that damn worn out old couch so much, why don't you stay here and watch it? - Now how can I stay here and watch it if I'm going to the convocation? You talk foolish. - Don't go. Stay here and watch it. Nail it down before you leave. - Don't hack the nail it down thing, got no business fooling with it. - Then I'll nail it down for you. - What you fixing to do? - I'm gonna nail it down. - [Weedy] Don't you put no nails in my furniture! - I want to make sure it's here when you come back. - Give me that hammer-- - No! I'm gonna make sure no one can move this piece of junk out of here. - Put a nail in my furniture if you want to. - I'm gonna nail every piece of furniture in this house down. Make sure that when you come back, it's just like you left it. - I'm gonna get somewhere and sit down. - Then you nail it down! - Don't you take nothing outta here, 'cause if you do-- - What? - You just take anything out of here and you'll find out what. Fool around directly and make me mad. (Alberta grumbling) What's that you say? - Nothing. - Well don't be making all them old mumbling sounds, make you think you're talking about me. - I'm talking to myself. I'm not thinking about you. - [Weedy] Well let me know it then. Lord have mercy. - What? - I wonder if I remembered to put my white stockings in my suitcase. - Well you're not gonna open that thing to find out. I'll go down to 39th Street and get you another pair. - [Weedy] Would you do that for mother? - All right, I'll run down there and get 'em. - Well hurry back before brother gets here. - I'll get back as quick as I can. (pleasant music) (kids shouting, laughing) - Oh? Oh. You Mr. Jordan, sir. Come on in. - Alberta here? - No, she just stepped out for a minute, but you can come on in and sit down. - Thank you ma'am. - You seem to know your way around this apartment pretty good. - It don't take me too long to get used to a place. - I can see that, stick around. - Ma'am? - You and Alberta done got to be right friendly. - Yes'm. - Know I'm going to the convocation? - You going away? - Catching a train for the convocation tonight. Be gone for two weeks. - Alberta going with ya? - No. She's not going. I was wondering, Mr. Jordan, would you do me a favor? - Well anything I can, Mrs. Warren. - Will you not come around here while I'm away? - Would you mind if I ask why? - You know why. - I do? - The devil, Mr. Jordan. And my daughter done opened up the door and beckoned you to come in. - You don't really believe I'm the devil, Mrs. Warren. - I didn't just come into the world yesterday, Mr. Jordan. I know ya, know who ya are. - Who do you think I am? - I've been seeing all you old blind street singers the longest day of my life. I know where you been, and I know what you done done. I even know how you got blind, Mr. Jordan. - I was born blind. - I know that. - You do? - Probably come from a long line of blind street singers. - Yes'm, I do. How'd you know that? Did Alberta tell ya? - My eye commenced to jump the minute I saw you, and when my eye commences to jump, something ain't right. There's danger afoot. - Yes'm. - And that woman you been looking for. - Grace Waters? - Still looking for her? - I don't know. Lately I ain't too sure that I am. All I know is that now when I knock on doors, I sort of hope she won't be there. That thought passed through my mind several times lately. - Well you keep on looking for her, Mr. Jordan. - Why? - You know why! - Alberta? - That's right. You know exactly what I'm talking about! - Oh ma'am Alberta-- - Is not for you! No way whatsoever. - How do you know that? - Because you're a sloo foot, good for nothing but sloo footing up and down the road looking for that woman. - Well maybe you're right. - Not that I have anything personal against you, Mr. Jordan. - No ma'am, I just make your eye jump. - Best thing for you to do is just leave poor Alberta alone. - All right, Mrs. Warren, I'll stay away. - As long as you're in the neighborhood. - I worked all the buildings in this neighborhood. Goodbye, Mrs. Warren. - Goodbye Mr. Jordan. You will keep your promise. - I won't bother Alberta no more. - You'll be doing an old woman a great kindness. - Yes'm, goodbye Mrs. Warren. - Hello Jordan. - Oh Doc, how are ya Doc? - I'm okay. - You still writing that number? - To tell you the truth, I only played it once. - It came out last week. - Yeah I know. - Well you should've been on it, it was a good number. - They're all good if they fall. - It's gonna fall again in a little while. - Triple zeroes? - I'm telling ya. - Well why don't you get on it? - Me? - Yeah, your money's good as anybody else's. - Nah it wouldn't fall for me. - You mean to tell me if you had money on it it wouldn't have fallen? - I'm just not lucky. I can give other people the numbers, but it wouldn't fall for me. - Well maybe I'm the same way. - No it'll fall for you. - If I get a few extra dollars, I'll put something on it. - You broke Doc? - Not broke, just fractured. - You wear a hat, Doc? - A derby. - Take it off and give it to me. - [Doc] What you doing? - [Jordan] I'm filling your hat full of money. - Oh man, I can't take your money. - I want you to get on triple zeroes. - Must be 30 or 40 dollars in here! - You play it every day. You don't even have to box it. No matter what combination it falls in, you win. - Hey! - See ya Doc. - Wait a minute! - Can't you say good evening to folks before you head to the jug? - Good evening, sister. - Breath so strong now it'll knock folks down when they pass. - You ready to go? Come on, you going to the train station tonight. - I ain't sure I wanna ride in that old car anyhow. - Now what's wrong with my car? - Nothing, outside it's a rattle trap old enough to have driven the lord to the last supper. - Look, I ain't got all evening. You going to Montgomery or not? - Well, if the gate keeps swinging in the direction it's swinging, I'm going. If the gate should decide to swing in another direction, I might have to change my plans accordingly. Lord? Give me the strength to endure. - Sister, not only will you endure, but you will prevail. - You mind taking my bags back into my room? I've decided not to go. - You're not going? - I can't go off and leave Alberta here by herself. You know she ain't been well. - Well maybe a little rest from you will be a tonic for her. - Of course if you'd come over here and stayed with her while I'm gone? - What for? - To look after her. I'd be willing to give you a little something. - Gonna pay me to stay here while you're gone? - A few dollars. - What's a few? - More than you got. - No, I got my own personal life to think about. You see, Pearl keeps me pretty busy. - You still fooling with that folk? - Had to go all the way to 43rd Street to find your size. - You could've took your time, we ain't going nowhere. - Not going? - I ain't settling my mind on it. - Ma, you're getting on that train. - I ain't made up my mind yet! - Why you worrying me about not going? Now you sure gonna go. Put these in your purse. Get her suitcase, Uncle Doc. - Just gonna make me go. - That's right. - Say Weedy, start to marching. - Well. - Take this on your arm. - Lord willing, I should be back here sitting by my own window come two weeks from this very day. I'll send you a telegram so you and brother can come and pick me up. - Come on, Weedy. - I'll send you a picture postcard from Montgomery. That is, if I make it to the train station in one piece. You oughta get it in a day or so. - Weedy! - Be a good girl. Pray for me, I'm off with a drunkard. Make haste, I got a train to catch. - Jesus. ♪ Amazing grace ♪ - Jordan! ♪ How sweet ♪ - Jordan! Jordan! Jordan, can't you hear me calling you, Jordan? ♪ A wretch like me ♪ - Jordan! ♪ I once ♪ ♪ Was lost ♪ - Where's that singing coming from? - The little storefront church down the street. (gospel music) - They sing purty fair. (gospel music) - You were going away, weren't you? You were just gonna walk away without even saying goodbye to me. - I promised Mrs. Warren-- - Mama? What did you promise Mama? - That I wouldn't hang around here while she was gone. - Don't pay Mama any attention. - She was right, I shouldn't hang around you. - I don't want you to go away, Jordan. - But you don't know anything about me, Alberta. - I don't need to know anything about you. I just don't want you to go away. - I can't stay around here forever. I've been around here too long as it is. I've already gone through the buildings at least twice. It's time I was moving on. - You don't have to do that. You could stay here. - Here with you? - Be better than walking around begging. - Well how could I go on looking for Grace if I'm staying here with you at the same time? - You couldn't. - Then you want me to stop looking for Grace? - You're never going to find her, Jordan. - Well it don't make no difference whether I do or not. - Why do you keep looking for her? - It's what I do. - Why? - I don't know why. Maybe I did when I first started out, but if I did I've forgotten. All I know is I got to keep on looking for her. It doesn't matter whether I find her or not, long as I keep on looking for her. - Wouldn't it be better living here with me than stumbling by yourself? - You want me to live with ya? - Yes. - For how long? - No special time. - Oh that would be a special time. One day I'd hear it in your voice. - Hear what in my voice? - The special time. - I don't understand what you're saying. - There've been other women I've stopped off with since I've been looking for Grace. Women that had soft, sweet voices, so I stopped off. Their voice was little inside them, and after I'd been there a while, the voice would start to get bigger and bigger, oh for a while they'd still be sweet, but then they would become hard and cracked, and I'd know it's time for me to be moving on again. I'd be back looking for Grace, and I don't think I could stop off again. - You're saying that one day I will ask you to leave? - Not in words. - Oh you're wrong, Jordan. I wouldn't do that. - You'd need something from me. I'd give it to you, and then you wouldn't need me anymore. - What is it you think I need? - Just somebody-- - You're wrong. I don't need anyone. - You don't have to lie. It's nothing to be ashamed of, it's nature. Everybody's got nature one way or another. - You think I'm talking about nature? You think that's why I want you to stay here, because of nature? - Well there's nothing wrong with that! - I don't have any nature. - Oh that's not so. - If you think that's why I wanted you to stay, you can get out of here right now. That's the only thing that's ever on me as vines. Mama's right, men are lower than dogs. - Well I reckon I better be getting along. - Maybe you better. Don't go, Jordan. I don't want you to go. - Well I don't like a whole lot of fussing. - I won't fuss. I promise. I won't fuss! - I think I've upset you. - I'm not upset. I'm not gonna let myself get upset. - Right, right, don't let yourself get upset. - I should've gone to church tonight. - Well why didn't ya? - I don't know. I haven't been going too much lately. I guess they'll start thinking I've backslid. - Well have you backslid? - No, of course not. I'm still saved. After Emmanuel Fisher's funeral, I haven't been going too much. - Who was he? - Just a boy. Man, around the church. - Friend of yourn? - No. No, I, I admired him from afar. - You mean you never got close to him? - Do you want a little taste? - No thank you. - What was she like? - Grace Waters? - You know who I mean. - Oh what's to say? - Was she pretty? - Folks said she was. - Was she nice? - She had a nice voice. - What kind of voice is that? - Rain dust. - Rain dust. - Kind of make you feel, you ever smell rain dust? - I don't even know what it is. - Down home when it gets so scratching hot you can't stand it anymore, then when it'd rain, folks down home would call it a white rain. Hard and heavy, cool that you could smell. Like the old earth was reborn as fresh as the morning she was created. - That's what she was like? - To me, she was. - Did she have a lot of nature? - She had a sufficient amount. - I shouldn't have asked you that. It's none of my business. - It don't bother me none. - Was she good up under her dress? - Yeah, she was very good up under her dress. - What is wrong with me? What am I saying things like this for? I sound like some old street woman. - No, you're no street woman. - I sound like one. - Oh but you are not. - Did you ever think that maybe Grace Waters might be dead? - She ain't dead. - How can you be sure? - Because I'd know it if she, I couldn't go on looking for her if, if I, oh why you trying to put those words into my head? - It's possible! - It isn't possible. - Is she too good to die? - Yes, yes she is. - That's what they said about Emmanuel Fisher. Said he was too good to die. Everybody loved him because he was so good. But that didn't stop him from falling out of the sky. - He fell out of the sky? - Mm, he was learning to be a pilot. First time he went up by himself, the plane crashed. They had to cut him out of the wreckage. Then they had to cut the metal out of his body. He was so good. He was too good to die. And he had a voice, oh he had a voice that would make the very angels in heaven weep when he raised his voice in song. Yet God saw fit to let him die. It's a wonder the weeping purple angels didn't just swoop down and lift him up out of that plane, and bring him safely to the ground. Yes Jesus, yes lord he was so good. - I suppose you went to his funeral. - Yes lord! Yes Jesus, I was there. It was the biggest funeral in the history of the church. I mean, that place was really packed. They had to bring extra chairs for the people to sit down. And even in the streets outside the church, people were standing. They came from all over Chicago to say one last goodbye to Emmanuel Fisher. He was so beloved, and they really put him away in style. His mother and father must have spent every penny they had putting him away. He had a beautiful powder blue casket, lined with gentle white silk that shined like mirrors. And you never saw so many white roses in your life. There were thousands and thousands of white roses covering his powder blue casket. And his casket was placed so it caught the light from the stained glass window. The light, the yellow light just fell on his face. He looked, he looked so much like Jesus. Like a beautiful sleeping Jesus. And they didn't need to paint his face. He was beautiful, without makeup. He was even more beautiful in death than he had been in life. Goodness still shined from his face, and then Reverend Goodlowe stood up and asked Agnes Malloy to sing Precious Lord. Do it once for Emmanuel, sister Agnes. ♪ Precious lord take my hand ♪ - Yes Jesus. Yes lord. ♪ Lead me on ♪ - Then I had to read the telegrams. ♪ And let me stand ♪ - To the bereaved parents of Emmanuel Fisher, our heartfelt sympathy. Signed the Reverend Lord S. Peters, Clarksdale, Mississippi. From Mr. and Mrs. John W. Lucas of Louisville, Kentucky to the family of Emmanuel Fisher. Please accept our deepest condolences at your loss. To the family of Emmanuel Fisher, our deepest regrets at the passing of Emmanuel Fisher. Dr. and Mrs. Harold H. Marcus, Augusta, Georgia. Emmanuel Fisher was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi on the sixth day of June in the year 1925. He was the son of Mr. Joseph Fisher, and Mary Anne Lovelace Fisher. Emmanuel Fisher attended Doolittle Grammar School, and went to Philips High School. The year after his graduation, he entered Pickering College in the state of South Carolina. While there, he became active in the Christian Young Peoples Conference, and won great recognition for his prize-winning speech, which was later published in the Christian Young Peoples Conference annual magazine called The Flight of the Purple Angels. In his speech, The Flight of the Purple Angels, he chose to reconcile life with death. That our lives here should be preparation for the life that is to come, for it is this life that is to come, which is our reason for being here. And we must earn that life, cleanse ourselves in order to earn that life, for the Father, he has created an orchard for us to live in with life everlasting. Emmanuel Fisher asked that when he began that last journey, that his family and loved ones not mourn him. No, do not mourn Emmanuel Fisher, for he is to stay sitting on the right hand of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Another voice has raised his voice in song this day. We may not hear that voice, because we are too far away, but the purple angels hear. And they weep, and are happy, for Emmanuel Fisher flies. He flies with them. - [Preacher] I wish to thank sister Alberta for her words. And I thank you God for Emmanuel Fisher. - Yes Jesus. - [Preacher] For Emmanuel Fisher has got the glory. - Yes lord. - [Preacher] I said Emmanuel Fisher is sitting in glory. - Yes Jesus. - [Preacher] For he has found life everlasting. - Mercy Lord, mercy. - [Preacher] Even though his earthly body was twisted and mangled beyond repair. Even though and with his knowledge-- (grunting) - [Preacher] And even though they could not further-- - Oh mercy Jesus, Jesus. - [Preacher] On that boulder is still running-- - Yes Jesus. - [Preacher] The breath of life has been-- - Yes Lord. - [Preacher] The breath of life that only God can blow into him has been blown back into him-- - Oh Emmanuel Lord, Jesus glory! Take me to Jesus! I said take me to him! - [Preacher] Oh Emmanuel, tell them to get the crown ready. - Yes Jesus. Yes Lord. Yes Jesus! - [Preacher] Tell them I'm coming to Emmanuel. - Yes Jesus! - [Preacher] Tell them to get my crown ready. Tell them to get my robe ready. Tell them I'm coming, Emmanuel. - I want to shout, Jesus! (laughs) - [Preacher] I'm tired of this body. I'm tired of this truth. - Fill them with the Holy Ghost! Take the devil with the Holy Ghost! Let me dance the dance of happiness! I wanna dance the dance of happiness! Let me speak in tongues, oh Lord! Twist my words unto you, Jesus. Let the meaning of my words be withheld even from me, only you Jesus. Only you Jesus. Only you, Jesus. Only. (stammering, panting) (sobbing) Only you, Jesus. Only you, Jesus. And the beautiful purple angels understand my utterances. Amen. And then they, they wheeled his body around for that last, final loop. Oh Jesus. Emmanuel! You're gone, Emmanuel. Let me kiss you once. Never in life did I kiss you. Now in your, your never-ending sleep, I want to climb into the casket with you, Emmanuel. I'm soaking wet, Emmanuel. The sweat is pouring out of me. I want to climb in there with you and baptize you with my body fluids. Holy Ghost, take control over me. I can't control myself anymore! - [Jordan] Alberta? - Oh Lord. - Alberta? - I want to kiss you again! - Stop it, stop it! - Emmanuel! - Shh. - [Alberta] I kissed you! - [Jordan] Yes! - You're not Emmanuel. - No. - I want to kiss him, I want to kiss him one last final time. - No, no. - You're not Emmanuel! - No, I'm Jordan. - [Alberta] Oh, Jordan. - Last of a long line of blind Jordans. - Oh Jordan. - Shh. - Kiss me, Jordan. Please kiss me. - This may be the last drink I ever take in this house, sister. - Got your little money, getting ready to get on down the road. - Always said when I hit them numbers, got a few dollars in my pocket I'd be jumping back to Memphis. - Pop said it don't sit so good on some folks. Get a little money they get so beside themself they commence to smell. - I'd rather have prosperity sit bad on me than have the poorhouses sit good on me. - If you was anything at all, you'd throw that money right back in old Jordan's face! - I can think of a whole lot of things I'd throw in somebody's face before money. - You ain't nothing, brother. You just ain't nothing! - I wouldn't give you 15 cents, that old ram talk. - Oh lord! I'd rather see her dead and in her grave than to turn out like this. - Oh stop it, Weedy. - You approve of this kind of conduct? - I don't approve or disapprove. - No, 'cause you've been cloaking for 'em all along. - I ain't cloaked for nobody. She's a poor, poor woman. - Think you going down to Memphis and be a bigshot again, don't you? Folks down there done forgot you ever existed in this world. - Now how they gonna forget me? Jimmy Sweet, the prince of Beale Street. - Folks done forgot you so long it ain't even funny. - They ain't forgot me. - You just get on back down there. You'll see. Might as well stay up here and help me. He ain't never done nothing for her. - Why did you have to come back? If you'd have stayed the allotted time Jordan might have been gone. Why did you have to come back? - I couldn't stay down there. - Put you on the train to Montgomery, you were supposed to stay for two weeks. Now you had to bring your behind back here and catch 'em. - It weren't the convocation I used to know. No sir, Jesus it wasn't. That wasn't no more the convocation I used to know than my big toe is. - Couldn't you have just stayed down there for the whole time? - Them colored folks down there done gone crazy in Montgomery. They just had that whole convocation just turned all the way around. Had to walk everywhere, telling colored folks not to ride the buses. I tell you, I don't know what done got into them folks. I walked so much my feet about to kill me. - But why aren't they riding the buses? - Lord, don't start me the line. Some young preacher down there got 'em all stirred up. Raising sand. They just push all the regular folks right out the convocation. Come into one of meetings hollering about they don't want to hear no more fogies. Young folks. Mess ain't wiped good from their behind, and they're calling folks fogies. Telling colored folks not to ride the buses 'cause they didn't want to sit in the back. - People stir up once in a while, there ain't nothing to all that. - They say they're gonna carry it on all over the South. - Carry what all over the South? - Not riding the buses. - Well let the fools walk if they don't want to ride. - I knew it'll be in Memphis by the time you get there. - Now how's it gonna be in Memphis? - I heard a woman say that when she got back to Memphis she was gonna start trying to get the colored folks there not to ride the buses. - Hm, better keep their foolishness away from Memphis if they know like I know they'd better. Why can't folks leaves things alone? Always stirring up things. - If they're stirring up here in Chicago, gonna be a whole lot of trouble down home. - Not in Memphis. - Didn't I just get through telling you? - Them folks come to Memphis with their foolishness, ain't nobody gonna pay 'em a bit more attention. They better keep their behinds away from Memphis if they know what's good for 'em. Memphis is a sporting town. They ain't got no time for no mess. Folks out looking to have a good time. - You better stay on up here. You'll be back up here I reckon. - Nah, I ain't never coming back to Chicago. Not in this life, anyhow. Sister? We're just about the last ones left. - Yeah, just about the last ones left. - Sister-- - Brother, don't you kiss me. We ain't never been a kissing set of folk. - No, we never was a kissing set of folk. - Hello Uncle Doc. - Hello Alberta. Ain't you through speaking? - She doesn't speak to me. - Ain't this a, you two sitting up here in this house not speaking to each other? - I'll speak to her when she speaks to me. - I don't approve of this, Alberta, not speaking to your mother. - What you want me to do? I tried to talk to her, but she won't answer me. Looks at me like something dirty laying in the street. - Well it was kind of a shock for her to come home and find you laying up in-- - Laying up with the man I am married to? - Well you know your mother doesn't go on with that sort of thing, and besides it's not a nice thing to do. - You've got a lot of nerve, Uncle Doc. After all the women you've laid around with in your life? - Oh, those chicks wasn't nothing. They wasn't my flesh and blood. - What about Mama, and Reverend Goodlowe? - What about 'em? - You think I don't know? - Listen, I gotta pick up Pearl and get my suitcase. - You're not driving? - No I sold my car. And remember, she's your mother. - I'll remember, oh yes I remember. - I'll pick you up on my way back to the station. - Mama? ♪ I've been 'buked ♪ ♪ I've been scorned ♪ - Mama I have to talk to you. ♪ I've been buked and I been scorned ♪ - Mama we have to move.

No sir Jesus. - Mama, we have to move. They're going to tear the building down. Do you understand? The building has been condemned. (humming) We can't stay here. Mama, you don't have to stay here. Papa is not coming back. - I ain't waiting for him to come back. I wish that thing would come stepping up here after the way he run off. I'd set his soul to rest. I'd spit in his face.

Don't pay any attention, Jordan. Why do you always have to keep up the devil? - What is it you want, Alberta to know? - How many red light houses do you reckon you played your music box in, Mr. Jordan sir? - You played in red light houses? - What do you know about red light houses? - Oh I done covered a whole lot of roads. - You played in red light houses? - Quite a few. - Red light houses. - I was born in a red light house. The same house, the same room, the exact same bed that my father was born in. A place called the Sty of the Blind Pig. - A house down in New Orleans. He's got the smell of blood on him, Alberta. I could smell it the minute he walked into this house. - How do you know so much about it? - Sure as I stand here, he's got the smell of blood on him. - She's right, I do have the smell of blood on me. The smell of butchered pig. That get in your pores, and you can't wash it off. - I don't smell anything. - I can smell it on myself. I can smell the bowels of the pig. All the parts that others threw away, they brought to the sty and it was cooked in scalding hot water. Sometimes that hot water was thrown into a man's face. Did you ever hear a man scream when he's scalded with the hot water that a pig been cooked in? It started with the butchering of the pig. Men died in the Sty of the Blind Pig, so did women. - [Alberta] What kind of women? - Women who sold their bodies in the Sty of the Blind Pig. Women that carried knives and cut their pimps when the shame overtook them. Pimps who cut up their women because they'd lost their manhood. I played my music box in places where men and women stood toe to toe and cut each other to pieces for cursing their mothers for birthing them into the world. And they've fallen on me with the blood oozing out of them, and I could smell the flesh of the pig mixed with their blood. - You're making this up. - Though that was left from Saturday night, got up and went to church on Sunday morning to pray for those that were slaughtered the night before. - She told you to say all this, didn't she? - [Weedy] I ain't told him nothing! - Lies! You're making this all up, why Jordan? Because you want to go and hunt for Grace Waters again? - Making it up? Haven't you seen this? - Like somebody done tried to cut your guts out. - Ain't you seen it? - No, and I don't want to see it. - Look at it! - Put your shirt down! - How could you have lain up with me and not see it? - I've never noticed. - You want to know how I got it? - No. - A woman gave it to me. - What woman? - No I don't want to hear about it. - What woman put her mark on you, Mr. Jordan? - A woman that I killed. I choked her to death while she was trying to cut me to death. - Then why ain't you in jail? - Because, there ain't no punishment for killing a nigger woman on a Saturday night. You just go to church on Sunday and pray! - This is what you've been laying up with. This is what you've brought into this house! - You ain't any better than he is. - What? - Going down to the church, carrying on with Reverend Goodlowe. - What are you talking about? - You've been going with him now for over 40 years. - Where'd you hear all this? - Why do you think Papa ran off? - Because he didn't have no grit in his craw! - He found out about you and Reverend Goodlowe. - Fools been accusing me and Reverend Goodlowe ever since before we left town. Reverend Goodlowe was pastor of a church down there, and he swore up and down I wasn't messing around with him. - And you kept on when you got up here. - I didn't even know that man was in Chicago when we moved up here. Where'd you hear all this? - Everybody around the church knows it. I guess Papa got tired of everybody pointing at him like he was a fool. - That ain't why he run off. - I know better. - He run off because he didn't believe that you was his! - Didn't believe I was his. - He kept accusing me and Reverend Goodlowe for so long, he commenced to see him in you. - You a liar! - Call me a liar and I'll slap you clean into next week! Daddy, with his strange old ways. Never did think he could make a baby. All the while I was carrying you, he kept hollering about he was too weak to make a baby. - Was I? - What? - Was I his? Tell me the truth! - Get away from me! I'll kill you like Christ walked the water. (Alberta sobbing) - I wish that I'd never laid eyes on either one of you two! What's that? What's that sister Martin always hollers out? How long? How long, oh lord? How long? - Alberta. - Don't come near me, please! - That life's done gone. The Sty of the Blind Pig is torn down. Even the blind street singers are dying out. (laughing) - Well let 'em all die out! Let us all die out! And make room for somebody else! The sooner, the better. (gentle guitar music) - Mr. Jordan? Mr. Jordan! - I told you, he wouldn't be here. - Maybe he got lost at the train station. He was standing next to me when you went to get the magazine for brother, and I looked around and he was gone. Maybe he'll make it back all right. - I told you, he's not coming back. - Did you tell him not to come back? - [Alberta] No. - [Weedy] But you know he's not coming back. - Yes. Was he ever really here? - Hm? - Oh I was just wondering something out loud. - [Weedy] Oh, what was that? - Just something that passed through my mind. - Well. Brother's riding now. - Mhmm, riding south. - [Weedy] Wonder where all them young folks was going. - Young folks? - Didn't you see 'em? Got on the same plane with brother. Sure looked a mess. Every one of them had nappy hair. - Nappy hair. - They could've gone to the beauty parlor and got their hair straightened before they went off visiting. - Yes, I saw them. They did all have nappy hair, didn't they? Funny, I didn't even think about it until you brought it up. But now that you mention it-- - Never liked going off traveling with my hair looking like that. - Sometimes I wish that I hadn't started straightening mine. Maybe it wouldn't be half burned out now. - You know, I was thinking something. You find us a place. I'll speak to Reverend Goodlowe and maybe we can draw out something from my funeral savings plan. - Oh, you don't have to do that. - Well if they're gonna condemn the building. - They probably won't be tearing it down for a little while yet. - You think we oughta stay here until they commence to destroy it right over our heads? - [Alberta] Ain't no need in getting in a rush now. - You think we got time? - Time enough I reckon. - Well, whatever you wanna do is all right with me. - All right. - From now on in I guess, everything's up to you. - Up to me? - [Weedy] If you want to draw out all the money from the funeral plan, it's all right with me. - Now you say that. After it's all over and done with, you say that? - [Weedy] What's all over and done with? - Everything. - [Weedy] I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about. - Why don't you go to bed, Mama? - Yeah, I'm tired. - Uh-huh. - What you mean, everything's all over and done with? - You know what I mean, Mama. - [Weedy] No I don't. - You just think about it, sleep on it. It'll come to you. - Tired as I am, I won't think about nothing. All I want to do is lay my head on that pillow. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Well so will you look at that? Look at her strut. Strutting like she was the best looking thing on the street. Hey you! Yes I'm talking to you! You ought to go somewhere and take off that red dress and do something about your behind shaking. (laughs) It's bouncing like a rubber ball! You needn't be trying to ignore me, you hear me! (humming) Lord. These young folks ain't no better nowadays. They just ain't nothing. Ain't even much what the birds left. Like I was just saying to Mama just the other day, Mama? Mama? Mama, where are you Mama? Mama? Come back, Mama! Oh, Mama. You laying out there? All by yourself. (sobbing) Mama! (coughing) (sighs) I'm all right, Mama. I'm all right. Because, I got grit in my craw. I got a whole lot of grit in my craw. (gentle piano music)
