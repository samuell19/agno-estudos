English Subtitles by Stuart J Walton (Sprout) Hi there. Hello girls. Good morning. Good morning, sir. See you at the session. Suzuki. You don't look well. She's here. You're in the way. Die! Hiromi Suzuki You're late, bitch. Hiromi, we've finished with you now. From tomorrow, Aki is in the box. She was tough on you, wasn't she? Hiromi, it's either beat her, or get beaten. Make it a good one or you're back in the box. Give it to her. Do it. Way to go! Well done, girl. You're back in the gans. Hiromi. Open this door. This silent treatment is very unfair to us. Hiromi. Goya-Champuru (Island of Light) From Nameless Nana: I have nowhere fo stay. My dad was into his hobby. He went to the beach fo take photos and he died there. We never found his body. I can't accept his death. I don't want to talk about my mother. From Cat: You don't go fo school, either? I don't. My parents and teachers give me hell. They never notice I'm being bullied. I feel like killing myself. Nameless Nana Kill yourself if you want. Much better than living. Goodbye. Sending "Goodbye" is foo sad. "Things in the adult world are also in your world.” “Like bullying someone, or being bullied by someone.” "Bystanders just watch the bullying.” "Feelings are hidden just like adults do.” “Nobody knows your pain.” "A heartache, isn't it?" Kenmun? 4 months later Not at all. I made too many. Please enjoy them. Thank you. These teachers today are absolutely useless. It's not like when your husband was a principal. Times have changed. It's just one of those things. How's Hiromi recently? Oh, dear. I'd better go now. See you again. Don't tell that shrew too much. That woman is nothing but a gossip-monger. Will you have some? No. When can you fix them? The bathroom tiles, I mean. Hiromi? I'll leave it here. Come and eat with us for a change. I'm the one who gets scolded by Grandpa. We meet again. Kenmun... What I need now is water. I am... ...so thirsty. But I'll put up with it. Because I don't want fo be bothered by family. Not “family” but "them." Kenmun... where are you now? Please read the poem by Toson Shimazaki. Miss Takeyama. "A coconut drifted ashore from an unknown, faraway island.” "Travelling all the way from its homeland.” "How long has it been washed by waves?” The grave of Hiromi Suzuki Why is she so nasty to us? I don't know what to do. I never had students like that in my day. They'd look me straight in the eye and say their piece. I wish her father were here. Stop being silly. He's dead. That girl is stubborn, just like her mother. I bet that's Kenmun! Nana, you need water? I'm surrounded by the sea. I'm down in Okinawa. He's in Okinawa... "I'm working as an instructor” "at a dive school on Iriomote Island.” "It's a great place.” "lI bet you're just hanging out doing nothing.” "Come down and help me." Iriomote... Kenmun is on the same island where that woman lives. Ishigaki Island Services will resume fomorrow. Attention. The final ferry from Iriomote has arrived at pier No. 6. Today's service from Ishigaki Island has ended. Kenmun... One month has passed since Dad was lost at sea. His funeral was the other day. No body, so we prayed to his camera instead. That was quite weird to see. Kenmun, about my Mother... It's taboo to talk about her at home. She opposed the family. She ran away, leaving me. I was two. Kenmun, I really need fo get away. How is the sky over there? Sending Message Sent Going aboard? Are you a runaway? What about school? What's your name? Aki. Aki Sakuma. How old are you? I'm sixteen. Only women over 30 fudge their ages. I'm Sayo. Sayo Yoshida. Call me Sayo. I'll drive you to the village. Then help me. Hurry up. Hey Ito, I'll deliver your load later. Grandma Yoshi. It's me, Sayo. It's from your son in Osaka. I'll get some pickled papaya. Did you eat Kimi's Goya? Was it good? Her black pearls are great, aren't they? Black pearls? Ryukyu black pearls have a mysterious glitter which brings out kindness. Each one is different in a subtle way. Here, pearls have been passed down for generations as good-luck amulets. Grandma Yoshi waits every day for her luck. Sometimes she says "Who are you?" Thinks we're her grandchildren. She has many grandchildren. But they rarely visit her. She's started to go senile. The villagers are concerned about her, so they take care of her. We're all self-sufficient. You're all very kind. We never think like that. That's delicious. Drink as much as you want. You can stay here. If you want. How much? I don't want money. I live all alone. The simple life. But I don't cook. I'll go back to work. Make yourself at home. You have no mail Nameless Nana: I'm Jonely and all alone. I lock myself up in my room and look at my computer. Kenmun-: It's beaming sunshine here. Bright red flowers in bloom. Wish I could show you. Clear blue sky here. I wish we could share Jt. Sightseeing already? Anything good to report? Let's have lunch after I finish. Come on. Get in. Hello, Mr. Inae. Are you home? Get the doctor. It's near Adan, on the shoreline. Move! Tell him Mr. Inae's collapsed. No! Which way do I go? Excuse me. How do I get to the clinic? Mr. Inae collapsed. Sayo sent me for help. My husband! Thank you. I'll get the doctor. I'll go. Go straight until you see a field. It's straight down from there. Who cares? Die if you want. It sure beats living. Dying... You won't die. You're full of beans. Mr. Inae... ...he's dying. Come here, Yasu. Take care of her. Mr. Inae's in danger. Oh my gosh! "5th anniversary of foster-home.” "Foster children & their island mother.” Kimiko Muraoka... She's Kidding. Kimiko Muraoka... So you're awake? I think you're anaemic. I'm Yasu. Who are you? —Sakuma... —That stinks! It's a stink bus. It's on me. It was there when I washed it. What a weirdo... Indeed. The stink bug is weird. So you're awake? Was he alright? Yes. The doctor's taking care of him. This is Aki. Shall I make another lunch? Please do. What's wrong with Mr. Inae? Terminal cancer. City doctors gave up on him, so he came to the island. You know what a hospice is? Hospice? A facility for people suffering from terminal diseases. They spend their last days as they want there. That's what we call a hospice. Shin, the doctor, opened one here 3 years ago. In cooperation with a childhood friend, Kimi. Kimi was a nurse for a long time. They also run a guest-house and rent another for patients. Young people must eat meat. What meat is it? Goat meat. Delicious, isn't it? Goat meat? I'll finish my rounds. You go home. Welcome home. I'm back! I'll carry them. It's too heavy. You're a tiny tot. No, I'm not. Mom, teacher loved my essay. Good. What did you write about? About you, Mom. I'm very moved. Can I read it later? "Being outdoors can be very tiring.” "But I'm fine." "Because I always lock my mind." Sending That's Shin, the doctor. Thank you. Your bravery saved Mr. Inae. Hey, over here. Aki, thank you for today. I was so surprised when you ran up. Oh, how refreshing! How old are you, Aki? Sixteen. Where are you from? Tokyo. Did your family let you come here all alone? They're very understanding. "Travel broadens a child's mind.” Mr. Inae! You shouldn't overdo it. He wouldn't listen to me. You are... Aki? Thank you. You saved my life. Mr. Inae... I feel much better. And besides you're here. Forget that I collapsed. I feel so safe and wanted here. You're right. When you were running, you were glowing. As fast as an antelope. Aki, eat up girl. Hey, Yasu. When will you leave the island? Hurry back to Osaka. That Osaka accent is weird. You just don't know how to talk! Are you related to Sayo? I thought not. She said she has no one. She said Yuta' means ‘lonely.' Yuta? Yuta' summons the spirits of the dead, and gives good advice to people. A kind of shaman. The island has a long history. Seeing that which others can't must be lonely. When she's drunk, she complains about it. She'll soon stop snoring. So you're Aki. I'm Kenichi Kawashima. I work at the divers' shop near Adan. Are you an islander? No, I'm from Okayama. I'm just bumming along the seacoast. See you. Kenmun-: I'm very open minded. Everyone's having a party, getting drunk. The moon... Hi, Aki. I harvested far too much. Take some home. Hello, Aki. I've brought some vegetables. That's good. Eat them all up. We worked very hard to grow them. I enjoyed last night. Aki... ...I must thank you. Hiromi, it's either beat her, or get beaten. It's been so long since I've had bread. That's good. Sayo, why don't you ever cook? I don't enjoy eating alone. Can you see something in me? I heard you're a shaman. I don't see anything. My shaman ‘Yuta' can see nothing until you open your mind to her. Once I was taken seriously ill. I went to doctors but none could cure me. I was on the verge of death. I visited so many ‘Utaki' where you pray to God. I went and prayed there for God to cure me. Eventually I recovered. I got divorced, too. I just wanted to die. Around then, I started seeing things ordinary people don't see. God can be cruel. But the Yutas on this island have all experienced such things. And they can hear oracles. Sayo, are you asleep? Listen, Sayo... ...I haven't ...I haven't been going to school. Why not? I'm afraid of school. Friends become your enemies. Everyone's under so much stress. And all searching for the next person to bully. You can't reveal your true feelings. The teachers and Grandpa never notice anything. All they say is I just have to put up with it. You can stay here as long as you like. City people are all far too busy. They only fulfil their roles in family or at work. Kimi told me that after she came back from Tokyo. Good night. Nameless Nana: Grandpa is forever a principal. It's a month since Dad was /ost. We just had his funeral. No body, so we prayed to his camera instead. "It's taboo to talk about her at my place.” "The family all hated her.” "She ran away when I was two.” "All T need now is water.” "I'm very thirsty.” "But I'll put up with it.” "I don't want them to bother me.” Kenmun, being out all the time is tiring, too. But I'm fine. Because I can always lock my mind. Hello, Aki. Got plenty of water? "All T need now is water.” "Come and help me.” So you actually came, Nameless Nana. Kenmun. Bend your knees. Watch me. Now you try it. Are you okay? Good. Let's go. I never thought you'd come. You're very brave. Just like you said. About the Hibiscus, they're such a bright red. Your mail has really cheered me up. You're so free and you never preach. I bet I'm different to your image of me. No, not at all. I'm glad you came to see me. The first mail friend to visit me. I'll show you around the island. Hey, what's up? You're full of beans, aren't you? To be honest, I didn't come just to see you. My mother is also here on the island. Your mail really shocked me. Being on the same island as my mother. But I have no real memories of her. Dad always put off any discussion about her. Have you told her yet? I don't think I will. I'll just head back home. So, Kenmun... ...please keep this a secret. Sure. She's still on the island? She didn't take the ferry out. So she's not on Ishigaki Island. There are poisonous snakes in the hills. I've prepared serum. Let's start searching. Don't worry Yoko. It's not your fault. We'll soon find Mika. Mika has gone missing. They're supposed to go back to Nagoya tomorrow. But Mika didn't want to go home. Mika's asthmatic and Yoko came to keep her company. Yoko wants to go back home. But Mika refused to. So they got into a fight. I tried to follow her. But I lost her at the edge of the forest. We understand, Yoko. Watch her. I'll go start a search. She could be there. Near the hollow tree. That mountain track. She was there yesterday. You know the place? Maybe. There's a big sappan tree. Get in. We're almost there. Not this tree. It's a little bit further. Hey, Takuro. Find her? Where is she? We'll try the point. Did you find her? —Not yet. —TI'll search up here. Here? I thought she'd be here. It all looks the same. I'm lost. I'll keep searching. You head back to town. Stay with me or you'll get lost. Mika, answer me if you're in here. Answer me. Mika, what's wrong? Are you hurt? Are you okay, Mika? You've hurt your leg. I won't go home. I want to stay on the island. But you can't. You've regained your health. You must go home with your sister. I want to stay here. I'm so pleased to hear that. But if you do, you'll soon miss your sister. That's not good. You can come back any time. Everyone's so worried about you. They're all searching for you. Let's go. Can you stand up? Here's Yoko. I'm sorry, Sis. Now we can go home tomorrow. Good. Aki. Thank you, dear. Do you take photos? Yes, I'm a tourist. That's Toshiko's granddaughter. She's leaving here soon. She'll attend school in Okinawa. Toshiko's teaching her the island traditions. I saw Hiromi yesterday. She's so much like you. Especially her eyes. That same piercing look. I thought maybe she's your daughter. When did you start to notice the resemblance? At first, I didn't really notice it at all. But she smells the same. She smells just the same as when she was a baby. I still remember that smell. Sayo told me she had run away from home. Then I realized it was her. Kenmun, I met my mother. Kimiko Muraoka? My grandparents always told me that my mom was a stubborn woman from the southern islands. She took Dad's spirit with her when she ran away and left me. But... “I only believe what I can see.” “I only believe in the adults I respect.” "That's all I can say.” Thanks for taking care of them all year. Thank you for everything. You're most welcome. Thank you. I'm sorry about Mika's les. Not at all. I'm glad they're both so healthy. Did you have a good time here? Goodbye, Mother. Goodbye, Island Mother! Come again. Promise me you will. Ah, we meet again. They're very sweet. And so well-ripened. The fragrance alone fills my belly. Please eat it. Thank you. Various people come and go. That's the way here. Mr. Inae will soon die. We must see him off. Doctor. Please take the mask off. Please. Doctor, let him say farewell to Yoshiko. My dear... Yoshiko, thank you. You have suffered so much, my dear. Now you can be at peace. The time of death is 10:40pm. They're very sweet. Hiromi, give me a big smile. No way. Akihiro's body will be never found... He's been missing for two days. There's no hope now. I shall protect you. You know, I've always thought... Who cares if I die? It must be easier than living. I thought Mr. Inae had no connection to me at all. But he gave me a guava. Because he couldn't eat them anymore. He told me how sweet... I hated Dad for dying because of his stupid hobby. He left me all alone. But he really did die. I'll never see him again. If you die, it's truly the end. But I preferred death to having to live on. That wasn't your true mind. We only think like that when we're depressed. But now you're not all alone, are you? Why did you come here? Hello, Aki. Where's Kimi? She's back at Adan by now. Mr. Inae did very well. What's wrong, Aki? I'm not Aki. I'm Hiromi. Aki is the name of a friend from primary school. She bullied me, so we're not friends now. I tried very hard to go to school. But then they chose her as the next target. And I... Even though I knew how much pain it causes... ...I beat her just like the others did. I actually hit her. My heart ached. I frightened myself. I haven't attended school since last June. I locked myself up in my room. I didn't say a word to my grandparents. My father is dead. He went out to photograph whales last May. He had a boating accident. Did you know who I was? How did you know? The day after you came here, I called your grandparents in Tokyo. They're so worried about you. So you knew? But it wasn't my place to tell you I'm your mother. I'm the one who abandoned you there in Tokyo. Now you're all grown up. Akihiro, your father I mean, and I met on the island. We got married and started living with his parents. Then you came along. I never thought... ...I never thought we'd end up like this. It's a very difficult thing for two people to keep going in the same direction. I'm a very stubborn woman. But listen, Hiromi... ...I'm so happy to see you. Because I... ...I realize that our lives will forever be linked together. Thank you. Dad used to make this for me. Did he? Here. I partake. Delicious. This is the original. You can put anything in Goya-Champuru. Put it all in the pan and fry with oil. What does Champuru mean? The Goya cucumber is far too bitter by itself. But if you mix it with other food, it makes a perfect dish. Champuru also stands for a kindly welcome. This is for you, Hiromi. It was my mother's. Mother... I'm glad that I'm your daughter. And glad I came here. Come on. Eat up, sirl. Eat it all. It's delicious. I'll always protect you. What did you say? That's the island of 'Maburai.' ‘Maburai'? It means “to be protected by past souls.” Islands are like people. They're all living in a big ocean. Like us, they're all lonely. But they're all guarded, too. Death is not the end. The soul remains. These souls protect their loved ones from the heart. We'll meet again, dear. Doctor, please. Mr. Inae! It's spotless. You cleaned, so do I have to cook? Thank you so much for everything, Sayo. No need for that, we're friends. You idiot! That could have been fatal! Check the tanks thoroughly, I told you. I'm sorry. I lied to you. I'm not a dive instructor yet. I'm still studying. It's nothing. I found the BBS of kids like you who lock themselves away. It made me feel superior to them. I thought I was so cool. But it's just the opposite. The reality of my own dream has almost crushed me. The sea, the flowers, even the sun are too bright for me. Then what is your dream? To be a diver and find the perfect diving spot. When 1 do, I'll open the perfect dive shop. “I only believe what I can see.” “I only believe in the adults I respect.” What will you do, Hiromi? First of all, I'll go home. After that, I haven't decided. Cast Mikako Tabe Kohei Takeda Misako Oshiro Jun Fubuki Directed by Tetsuya Matsushima
