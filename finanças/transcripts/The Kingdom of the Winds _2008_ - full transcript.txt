{\a6}KINGDOM of the WIND Episode 4 If we trespass the border, there will be no going back. Don't you know all the chieftains in the capital... can't wait to find the right excuse to trample on you? This could become the spark which inflames their evil plotting. - That's enough. - Your Highness! You cut ties with him long ago. It is time to forget it. We shall take a shortcut past Mt. Cheonma. You wasted time on people who are about to die. No matter if they're enemies or not, how can you treat human lives with such lassitude? This is the frontier, and we're frontier defense guards. We don't have the luxury of showing benevolence... to human life which trespassed our borders. You're serving the enemy's interest this way, Milady. Martial law dictates such behavior, regardless of social status, shall be punished with decapitation. You are so well versed in the depths of martial law. I wonder why you don't seem to know anything... about our diplomatic relations with the neighboring states. Goguryeo's King Yuri is in Buyeo Fortress now. The Chief Marshal is not even here, so don't let the situation deteriorate with ill-advised moves. I told you not to let anyone in! My apologies. Slay them. What?! I said slay those fools! Chief! What is going to happen to us? Can't you see for yourself? Because of that loathsome scoundrel, we're all dead. Hey, you fool! Say something! We're all going to die because of you. Say something! Take them out! Yes! Get up! Move! - Behead them! - Yes! Spare us! Spare us! Spare us! Stop! Why? Any last words before you meet your demise? I am... a spy. These civilians have nothing to do with me, so spare them. You must have martial law here in Buyeo. Killing civilians because of a mere spy... is unbecoming of a self-proclaimed empire like Buyeo. Whether you fools are spies or civilians, it does not concern me. The only important fact is that you trespassed the border. You shall become the perfect excuse... for Buyeo to attack you. Behead them! Spare us! Spare us! Enemy troops! It's the enemy! - What's the matter? - Goguryeo troops infiltrated the camp! - You, slay these fools. - Yes. - Let's go! - Yes! Here. And I thought you were just a crazy fool. If Goguryeo troops catch us, we would meet the same fate, so we shall part ways here. Let's go! Muhyul! Buyeo Palace King Yuri has become my nephew, so Goguryeo and Buyeo shall become brother nations from now on. From this moment on, I plan to wash away the vestiges of our inimical past, and start anew. What you shall drink from these cups... will celebrate our newfound alliance's unremitting bond. Here! Let's drink! My dear nephew. Come here, and have a duel with your old uncle. Your Majesty! You drank too much. It would be discourteous to the King, so please stop. Oh oh! Uncle and nephew are engaging in duel, what damned courtesy do you need? Ahh... what are you waiting for? Follow me. Your Majesty. I'm fine. How shall we fight? Swords?! Spears? Bows? Or, perhaps a bare-handed scuffle? I shall make no exceptions. You choose. How shall we fight? I shall choose swords. Fine. What are you waiting for? Bring us swords! Let's see what kind of skills my dear nephew can boast of. Let's see! I see. You closed an eye on this old man. What are you saying? My skills could never match Your Majesty's. Your Majesty. I need to speak privately with you. Your Majesty. It's fine. I even accepted you as my nephew. Your bowing down to me... Was it just deceitful imposture? Heed my words! Confine King Yuri and all his followers! Yes! There is no reason to hesitate. Punish King Yuri, and launch a war against Goguryeo. Your Majesty. The heavens granted us this golden opportunity. We can always act after the truth is revealed. It's an evident provocation, who needs further investigations? We shall give Goguryeo no time to prepare, and attack right now! King Yuri already acknowledged Goguryeo as our vassal. Why would he engage in such foolish provocations, while he is in Buyeo? There must be a reason even King Yuri doesn't know, so we need to maintain prudence. We can take this chance to trample on them, not just make them vassals! All we need is to kill King Yuri... and deal with Prince Haemyeong, and that shall be all. This is a priceless opportunity. Why on earth are you hesitating so much? Your Majesty. Don't show any reluctance. We shall kill King Yuri and begin the war. - Hurry, hurry! - Master! - Did you find out? - Yes. King Daeso confined His Majesty, it's true. So is it also true that Prince Haemyeong attacked Buyeo? Ahhh... can't you guess by yourself? It's so obvious. King Yuri is in Buyeo Fortress, how can His Highness attack them? Unless he's gone completely crazy, how could he do that? Anyhow, His Majesty has been confined there, what can we do? How much money did we spend to start business in Buyeo?! What can we do now? What's your plan? Jolbon Fortress They violated martial law, so I shall punish them severely. Bring them back to the caves. What?! Keep this fact a secret from the entire army. Understood? Yes. Chamgunnim*! (*deferential address) Where are we going? Back to the caves. The caves, you said? Why are you bringing us there? I'll accept any punishment, but keep us in Jolbon! I will not go back there. You still don't realize what you fools caused? Because of you, Buyeo and Goguryeo risk entering a war, and we can't even protect His Majesty. His Majesty is in Buyeo Fortress now. But we attacked the Buyeo border defence guards. Think King Daeso would let His Majesty live?! I don't understand why His Highness spared you, but if you want to survive, just go back there quietly. Look at all those bruises. I'll have to treat those to start with. Buyeo Palace What on earth is wrong with you people? Is putting on the mask of brotherhood right in front of us, and then stabbing us in the back, part of King Daeso's nature?! Shut your mouth! Follow me, Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Your Majesty! - Your Majesty. - Your Majesty! Your Majesty. Was my pledge of taking Buyeo as our brother nation inadequate? What shall I do to earn your trust? I trust you. Then... what is the reason you confined me? Did I commit any mistake? You... didn't raise your son properly. Prince Haemyeong invaded our border defense camp. That is not possible. You must be the victim of a false report, Your Majesty. Yes. I couldn't believe it myself. Therefore... I verified its authenticity more than once. But it was the truth. Haemyeong truculently slaughtered my troops. Why could that boy have acted that way? His father is in Buyeo Fortress. Why did he commit such dreadful misdeeds? Does Haemyeong wish to see you dead? Does that boy... lust after your throne? That is... That is not... Drink. I can guess how you are feeling now. Just like the Jumong I so deeply trusted, betraying my devotion with noisome deceit, you must be feeling bewilderment and dejection. I could kill you right now, and invade Goguryeo. But I shall forgive you... because you are my nephew now. I shall show you the forbearance of an uncle. I shall never forget... the benevolence you showed me, for the rest of my days. But! You shall bear in mind. Enlighten that foolish son of yours. Tell him if he dares to repeat such dauntless provocation, he shall meet his demise right on his father's watch. Because of you, Buyeo and Goguryeo risk entering a war, but I still don't know why His Highness spared you. I have something to ask you. What kind of man is His Highness? Why he came to save me. Why he risked a war to save a nameless commoner like me. I can't understand why. The Prince Haemyeong I know... is capable of that and much more. If it's something existing in Goguryeo, he would spare no effort to save even a rootless plant. He would never let a soldier under his command perish under his watch. I violated martial law. No matter if his benevolence touched the sky, no general would forgive someone who violated the law with such ease. Why am I receiving special treatment? That... When the time comes, that's for you to ask him. Jolbon Fortress Your Highness. After leaving Buyeo Fortress, His Majesty is heading here. What were you thinking, committing such insagacious blunder? I have no excuses. No matter the punishment, I shall accept it in obeisance. A crown prince like you put his father and country in peril, so death would be a most appropriate punishment. But I shall find out first. Tell me why you committed such a foolhardy mistake. I said tell me! Didn't you heed my words?! Were you wishing for my demise? Were you really lusting after my throne? I shall make no excuses. You fool... Is that disdain I see in your eyes?! Tell me right now! Your Majesty! Abate your angst. To save a mere soldier, he did all that? I can't understand why myself, but that is what happened. Who on earth is that soldier? Who might that man be, enough to move Haemyeong to betray logic? I heard the rescued soldier has disappeared from the encampment. Nobody knows his whereabouts. As this country's Crown Prince, you committed an abhorrent mistake. What's more, if we are to squelch King Daeso's anger, and maintain the friendly relations we spent so much effort on, we shall take a resolute stand towards your punishment. I shall not only revoke any authority Haemyeong has over Jolbon, but also deprive him of any authority as Crown Prince. Your Majesty. We shan't dismiss His Highness's mistake, but such punishment is much too scathing, Your Majesty. May you forgive him. Your Majesty. His Highness has ably led Jolbon for years. The people in Jolbon have the utmost trust in His Highness, so deign to retract such order, Your Majesty. Then, what shall we use to quench Buyeo's indignation? Are you telling me to enter a war with them? I shall... accept your wish, Your Majesty. Ubo, heed my words. Yes, Your Majesty. I hereby proclaim you as Lord of Jolbon Fortress. Reorganize our forces in Jolbon Fortress, and spare no effort helping to smoothen our relationship with Buyeo's army. This humble subject of Your Majesty... shall follow your command with utmost devotion. Haemyeong, help the new Lord settle in, and reflect on your past mistakes. Baegeuk is a most sagacious specimen, so learn from him what politics is all about, and how diplomacy shall be handled. I shall follow your command. Before we head back to Gungnae Fortress, we shall go worship at His Majesty Jumong's shrine. Start preparations, Lord of Jolbon. Yes... Your Majesty. This punishment is way too harsh. How can Your Highness become a subordinate of Baegeuk? How about asking His Majesty's consent, and returning to the capital? It's better this way. I couldn't move freely all this time. Now I can hunt with you, and devote my spare time to reading. Your Highness! I have plenty of things left to do in Jolbon, so just follow my plans and don't worry. Muhyul. What's that? Ahh... what is it? It's nothing. Ahh... His Majesty is coming to the shrine. So, His Highness is coming with him? Since His Majesty is coming, he surely will follow him. She's responsible for the Girin Caves. She is Chief Decorator Hye Ap. Unlike other murals, there is too much humidity here, so we couldn't use lime. Therefore, we keep painting them to preserve the colors. Pass me the torch. Who drew the murals inside the imperial room? Come forward. It's him. Drawing such marvelous murals at your age. Your talent is astounding. Daebo. Yes, Your Majesty. Not only this young man, bountifully award every decorator... for all the efforts they have shown. You shall decide on an adequate compensation. Yes, Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Care to visit Her Majesty's family shrine? If I meet the Queen again, wouldn't that reopen old wounds? I need to talk with the Crown Prince, so leave us alone. Do you know what happened to that child? Are you referring to Muhyul? Back then, as I was going to Jolbon, I left him to a couple of farmers living in the mountains. You didn't go looking for him after that? When I returned there, I couldn't find anyone. If you want me to go look for him now, I shall do my best to find him. No. The sorceress's revelation is still piercing my thoughts. What would I do if I met him? That is the destiny that child and I share, so I shall forget him. Haemyeong. I shall make you a proud and meritorious heir... to the throne of our great Goguryeo. The reason I deprived you of all authority... was to protect you. Take good care of yourself. Gungnae Fortress Please, come in. Have a seat. Have you heard the news? That my adoptive son Baegeuk has become Lord of Jolbon Fortress? Yes. His Majesty deprived Prince Haemyeong of all his authority. I have heard that as well. The reason I asked to meet you, Sangganim, was to importune you with a favor. Please, don't hesitate. He wasn't borne out of my own pain and effort, but Prince Haemyeong is my son as well. By depriving him of all his powers, His Majesty covered up his misdeeds. But all the chieftains in the capital must disagree with that. Convince the chieftains for me, to forgive Prince Haemyeong for his mistakes. Do you see those as Lady Miyu's true intentions? I don't. Shouldn't her real goal be that of ousting Prince Haemyeong from power, and making her son Yeojin the Crown Prince? That's right. Anyone could guess what she's really scheming. She can't even conceal her rabid greed for power. Are you going to join forces with her? We would have nothing to lose, if a weakling like Yeojin became Crown Prince. Baegeuk has gained His Majesty's trust. In no time... the doors of our Biryu clan's domination shall open. If you shot just another time, you could have hit the target. That's enough. I've heard you are the best archer in Goguryeo. Are you missing on purpose? If I was aiming at King Daeso's heart, I'd understand. But what would I gain from killing that? Goguryeo needs to acknowledge Buyeo as its brother nation. Aiming arrows at King Daeso's heart would mean trouble. I never thought of considering Buyeo our brother nation. To me, Buyeo... is merely a foe. If you wish to quench His Majesty's anger, shouldn't you stand next to him? Does my staying here in Jolbon burden you? I was just talking for your own sake, Your Highness. I like it here in Jolbon. This is the place where I was born, and where my memories of youth were generated. I shall not become a nuisance to you, so don't feel too burdened by my presence. How could I? That is absurd. If it's in my powers, I shall help you with anything you need. My gratitude. But you shall bear one thing in mind. Remember that sovereign rights over Jolbon Fortress... belong to me, and no one else. You shall never attempt to trespass the border, and create dissent between our two countries as you did last time. Understood. I shall keep that in mind. I have something to ask you myself. I'm all ears. I would like to traverse our neighboring lands and learn of their situation. You pathetic mooncalves. You dare call that a duel?! What are you waiting for? Pay respect to His Highness. Follow me. Chamgunnim. Where are we going? Because of you, His Highness was deprived of his title, and all his authority as Crown Prince. An appropriate punishment for every sin. Isn't that how the world goes round? T...Then, are we going to die? Only thinking of your dire misdeeds, a hundred deaths shan't wash away your affront. Follow me. Muhyul! He caused Your Highness so much trouble already. Wouldn't taking him again become a burden to you? He won't. On the contrary, I threw away years of burden thanks to them. I got rid of all my responsibilities as Crown Prince, and I can finally explore the world as I'd wished to. I shan't call this punishment. It's a reward. I want to show Muhyul the world. The only places he's seen since birth... are these caves and Jolbon. Traveling the world shall be a huge reward for him. Do you know where we're headed now? We were told Hwangnyong and the Han empire. That's not it. We're going to Buyeo. Your Highness. Entering Buyeo would be dangerous. If your identity is exposed... We shall stake our life on this. But... I want to penetrate our enemy's heart, and palpate their state of affairs from within. Are you afraid? No. I wanted to go there myself. That's a relief. We're traveling incognito from now on, so don't address me as "Your Highness." Then... what should we call you? Hyungnim* would be nice. (*older brother/friend) Why don't you try? How would I dare disrespect Your Highness... It's fine. Try it once. H...Hyungnim. You don't know... how nice hearing that sounds. So, you couldn't sleep. Yes. Can I ask you a question? Go ahead. Tell me. You endured much trouble because of me. I wonder why you saved a miserable fool like me. I can't really understand. I am Goguryeo's Crown Prince. Every man and woman living in Goguryeo... is like a child to me. A father saving his child from the claws of hazard, would that need any reason? Does that satisfy your curiosity? {\a6}*Budo: close to early ideals of "paradise" or "fatherland"; land where "sons of heaven" resided Ever heard of the "fatherland*"? No. Just as you saw on those shrine murals, it was the gargantuan land where ancestors of Jumong's father (Haemosu) lived. His Majesty Jumong's lifetime dream... {\a6}*Gojoseon's past territory, still much bigger than early Goguryeo was to win back that lost* fatherland of ours. Right now, Goguryeo is suffering Buyeo and the Han's might, but my dream is to one day recover our fatherland. And I hope you and I, Muhyul, will fulfill that dream together. Your Highness has already saved my life. As powerless as I am, I wish to aid you in fulfilling your dreams. Bear this in mind. What we shall unite for and win back... is our fatherland. Buyeo Fortress (Buyeo capital, Northwest Manchuria) Muhyul! What's the matter? Have you seen anyone you know? It's nothing. You fool. How many times did I tell you? Don't attract any attention! My apologies. Enough. Let's go. Here, here, here! Here! Ahh... so pretty. Oh oh... here! This time, {\a6}*Proto-Turkic tribal confederation from Central Asia, the Han's fiercest enemy we have a wonderful specimen from the Xiongnu*. She might not speak our language, but she's very clever. so she shall learn the language in no time. Here! Wait... wait. I left out the most important detail, the fact she's completely clean. Not a single man touched her. I have a maiden for you, a maiden! Here, here, folks! Here... here. Here, so. Let's begin. Bids shall start at fifty nyang in silver coins. Fifty nyang. Here. Fifty nyang! Fifty nyang. Ah. Fifty nyang? And it shall be fifty nyang, from our dear Master Mahwang. 50 nyang. Here! Anyone cares to go with sixty? Sixty nyang! Ah! Sixty! Sixty nyang there. So, anyone going for seventy? Nobody is going for seventy? Seventy. Ah! Seventy! We have seventy on the table! Here! Anyone offering more? Eighty, ninety. Anyone going for eighty? Otherwise, we'll close bidding. One hundred! We have one hundred there! One hundred, one hundred! One hundred to take her, one hundred. Should we end bidding there? Hundred? And fifty?! One hundred and fifty, everyone! Here, here, here! One hundred and fifty. Here! Sold for one hundred and fifty to Master Mahwang! This beautiful maiden, sold for one hundred and fifty. Look at how pretty she is. And she's so tall and faithful. Ww...Www...What's the matter? Shut up and follow us. You... What the hell are you? Uh?! Where did you come from? Where the hell do you come from, ruining people's business with that chicanery?! Answer me, you prick! Before I strangle you to death, speak! That's enough. I was just jesting with you. Looks like you couldn't take it. Y...Y...Your Highness! What are you doing in Buyeo, Your Highness? I came to look around. They'll invade us sooner or later, so I should learn a bit more about the enemy, right? This is not the time to jest. If people find out you're in Buyeo, then, it's over for you. That's why you'll have to help me out. What?! As long as we're in Buyeo, help us conceal our identities. And, one more. Those Black Shadows you talked about and their training camp. Make sure we're able to infiltrate their camp. Tell me to die instead. I just settled here in Buyeo. Yes, I shall do my best to protect your identities. But... in...in...infiltrate the Black Shadows' training camp?! That... That's impossible, Your Highness. And I thought you'd be capable of everything. Your Majesty, I beg you! Fine. Then, let's see if I can stimulate your skills with something. When I become King, all the market rights held by the Biryu clan... shall transfer right into your hands. How about that? Don't you feel a sudden rush of loyalty energizing your spine? I shall arrange it immediately. Who are those fellows? They're acolytes of mine. - Did you look into it? - Yes. Once per month, a merchant group brings supplies to their training camp. All you need to do is enter that group as workers. This is what I can do for you. The rest is all up to you, Your Highness. That shall suffice. You're way too precious to waste on mere commerce. How about it? When I become King, I'd like to have you under my wings. No, I have no interest. Worry about the market rights you promised me, instead. You... are acolytes of His Highness, right? That's correct. I'm a soldier from the Jolbon encampment. But where does that necklace come from? It was left to me by my parents. Unload the supplies here! {\a6}*Physical constitution able to endure countless forms of poisoning People call this Mandok Bulchim Jiche*. What does it mean? It means a body able to resist every sort of poisoning. Either taking large quantities of poison at once, or getting accustomed to it via small doses, the body starts reacting to any poison in a way which neutralizes its effect. This is colorless, odorless, flavorless poison, the most dangerous kind. How do we make this poison? We combine centipedes, snakes, lizards, toads, scorpions, and every other animal... or bug with deadly poison, put them together inside a box, seal and bury it underground. Then, we open the box after a few days, {\a6}Dojin and find only the survivors, after the rest have been killed. That is the deadliest poison known to man. Impressive. Bring them here. This poison was taken from surviving toads, whereas this comes from scorpions. Kill them. Take a good look! This one is toad poison, - They're experimenting with... - while this is... - the effects of poison on them while alive. - from scorpions. These are scary people. Master! Master. It's big trouble! Oh... please, come in. I beg you, save her. I spent so much to buy her. Oh oh! She might be a mere slave, but how can you trivialize one's life as a mere matter of money? She's a slave. If it's not a matter of money, then what could it be? How does it look? She must have tried to poison herself. For starters, we'll have to take the poison out. Yes. Here. Help her drink. - More, more. - Yes. Here, she should be fine now. - You continue. - Yes. Thank you for your efforts. When she regains her consciousness, {\a6}*Concoction of yam, salt and egg whites, with an egg yolk thrown in at the end only feed her majeup* and nothing else for a while. Understood. You take care of the rest. So many patients are left. Where are you going? I'm too fatigued to continue. I'll have a drink instead. Drink too much, and it could harm you. Worry too much, and it could harm you! The next patient. Where does it hurt? Ah... Here... It hurts here. Milady! What's wrong? We have to escort you back. Can't you see the patients are waiting? Tell him I'll be back when I'm done here. He said to force you, if you hesitated. - Escort her! - Yes! Fine, I shall follow you. Step aside. I can't help you anymore today. You'll have to come another time. Get that fool! Move! Are you all right? I had so many patients left to help. How can you do this to me? His Majesty wanted to see you, what could I do? Let's go. Come in! Have you been in good health, Your Majesty? I haven't seen you in so long, you disappoint me. Are you still helping out patients on the streets? Your Majesty is ignoring them, I should at least take care of that. Yeon! How can you be so impudent? No need. It's because of that boldness of hers that I like Yeon. Going out on the street and helping people... despite being a princess. That's not your average feat. Th...Th...That fool! Get him! Move! Main Translator & Timer: MisterX Timing QC: julier Editor/QC: thunderbolt Coordinators: mily2, ay_link If we don't kill King Daeso right now, Goguryeo will forever be a vassal of Buyeo. Your Majesty. Allow me to take enough troops and slay him. How are you going to kill him? Assassination?! His Majesty looks strange. They're trying everything to kill His Majesty. You shall find every single one of them. Those are Buyeo troops! Get that fool! Maro, run! Get that fool! You can't! Who are you? Milady, I caught him. We captured spies, and he was among them.
