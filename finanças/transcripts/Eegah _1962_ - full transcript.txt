[music playing] [honks] Hi, Roxy! What are you doing in town? Thought I was supposed to meet you up at the club? Well, you still are. I just bought myself a new swimming suit tonight. TOM: Oh? Here. See? That? [ding] Well, I get off work in 10 minutes. Follow me out then. Follow you? Listen, I can change clothes and beat you out there. [scoffs] That's my girl. Her father's Robert I. Miller. Writes all those adventure books. You oughta see her swim. Hey! Gee, I sure am sorry, sir. I guess I was thinking about having dinner with my girl. She lives up at the club. [non-english speech] [honks] [grumbling] [screams] Roxy, it's me, Tom. Oh, Tommy! What's a matter? What happened? Is he gone? Who? Is he! I don't see anybody. Just take it easy and tell me what happened. ROXY: I saw a giant. What? Well, I did. Honest, I saw a giant. No, it was right in the middle of the road. Not a half an hour from here. He doesn't believe me. You didn't really expect anyone to, did you, Miss Miller? Why not? It's the truth. Honey, a prehistoric monster is a rather large order to swallow. Dad, I didn't say he was a monster. He was a giant. You know, a caveman. Club and all, eh? Yes. What my daughter saw she saw. Now let's just let it go at that. OK. But if you see your giant again, let me know in time to take some pictures? MR. MILLER: She will. Dad, you don't believe me either. Roxy, of course I do. I believe you saw something. Well, I saw a giant. A prehistoric giant. How about it, Tom? What'd you see? Like I told you, Mr. Miller, I wasn't there until afterwards. Tommy Nelson, I know what I saw. Sure, Roxy, but I mean, giant? There were giants. The bible says so. MR. MILLER: Yes, it does. In the book of Genesis. Something about in those days, giants walked the Earth. Well then? Maybe we can get some flashlights and go out and take a look for ourselves. Huh? No, this thing can wait until morning. Now you kids go and take your swim before the pool closes. ROXY: In the morning, now. It's a promise. Dad still doesn't believe me. Sure he does. And neither do you. I swear on my Elvis Presley LP. How big did you say he was? Oh, he was bigger than anybody you ever saw. I bet you were scared, huh? A little, but I had the funniest feeling he wouldn't hurt me. Yeah? In fact, I thought it was kind of cute. Oh! MR. MILLER: [inaudible] imagined the whole thing? ROXY: No. Well, let's be realistic about this. You said yourself that you think. Isn't it possible that you dreamed this whole idea? No, Dad, I didn't. There was a giant. Now I don't want to call this story of yours a lot of foolishness, and I haven't so far, have I? No. But if there were a giant, if anyone at all-- TOM: Mr. Miller, come here! What you find? TOM: I don't know. It sure looks like a footprint, though. Let me see. Dad, look. There's the heel, and there's the toes. Look at the size of that. It must've been made by a-- Say it. A giant. What did I tell you? And that's for finding it. I'll find the big boy himself [inaudible] if you feel like that. He left the road right here. Watch out for snakes. Ew! You better go back to the car. No, he's my giant. Holy God, he was standing right here watching us. And then he turned and took off, or-- Shadow Mountain. You suppose that's where he lives? It's possible. That would account for his never having been seen before. It's too bad we didn't bring the dune buggy and go after him. What for? I can get some pictures. Maybe even to bring him back. A lot of people aren't going to believe this giant jazz. No, we're not saying anything about this, you understand? Why not? As for the way everyone laughed at me. Your turn will come. I'm going up on Shadow Mountain with a camera. Are you going to write a book about the giant, Mr. Miller? That's the idea, Tommy. I'll take you up there. My dune buggy's all ready to go. -No thanks. -It is! I just gave it the works. There's no offense, son, but I'd like to take this trip in something a little bit safer. I'll see you in about two days at the most. Well, please take care of yourself. Now my credit cards are in the desk drawer. You make sure you leave them there. This thing's supposed to be safer than my dune buggy? MR. MILLER: All right, Kruger. Let's go. Now don't you forget. I want you to meet me at the mouth of Deep Canyon tomorrow at 4:00. [music playing] [grumbling] No! Wait, wait. No, no. No, no! [splashing] [yelling] [music playing] TOM [SINGING]: I love you, Vicky. You know I do. My whole life has changed, for the first day we met was my last day with you. Vicky, oh, Vicky! What have I done? Why can't we make up? We can have so much fun. If you don't want to love me, I was a fool! Oh, Vicky. You are my love. Vicky, oh, Vicky! I'm so alone. If you could just talk to me-- If I could just call you on the phone, would you give one more chance to a fool? Oh, Vicky, you are my love. You are my love. Vicky. Hello? Yes? Dad will understand. It's just one of those things. Just a minute, please. Do you know where Deep Canyon is? Yeah. Are you sure? Sure I'm sure. I've been there lots of times. Why? Don't worry, Mr. Kruger. I'll take care of it. Yes. Thanks for calling. Goodbye. What's up? That was Kruger from the airport. The helicopter blew a gasket or something. He won't be able to pick Dad up. At Deep Canyon? Yes. No problem. We'll get the dune buggy and we'll whiz right out there. This is whizzing? Wait till we get off the highway. Hang on to your [inaudible] But there's no road here. That's what the buggy was made for. [music playing] We sure bounce. My tires are filled with water. To keep you cool? No, for weight. It gives me traction in the sand. Watch this. [laughing] Wee! Come on, Dad's waiting. Wa-ha-ha! Wee! [music playing] There you are. Deep Canyon. I don't see Dad anyplace. Maybe we're early. ROXY: It's past 4:30. Hey, take it easy on that water. Well, I don't want it to dry out before Dad gets here. And don't you eat anymore! OK. It's 9:00. What do you supposed happened? Oh, nothing happened. He's not coming on a bus, you know? You can't expect him to be right on the dot. I know, but he should have made it before dark. Don't worry about it. He'll see the campfire and come walking in on us any minute now. That's what you said two hours ago. Well, he will. Well if you believe that, what's the idea of the bedrolls? TOM: Look, I carry all this junk in the buggy anyways, so you might as well get some use out of it. I'm not sleeping. Lie down, take a rest for a while. I'll keep the fire going. [gun cocks] Hey, what are you doing with that? I always carry a gun in the desert. There's coyotes around the camp. Put it away. We're not playing cowboy. You know, there's mountain lions around here too. But they won't come near a fire, I know that much. And I'm not going to have you take a shot at something that turns out to be Dad. OK, OK. I'll put it away on one condition-- that you crawl in and get some rest. OK! [music playing] [SINGING] If I had a thousand paintings in a marble gallery. Every single picture would be of Valerie. The vitamins are good, they say, and so the calories, but I feel like a tiger on one kiss from Valerie. I couldn't stand tomorrow and they can have today if someone took my Valerie a half a mile away. If I had a billion dollars and a banker's salary, I'd spend it all on flowers to give to Valerie. [whistling] Now who's Valerie? Well, now wouldn't you like to know? Tom? Tom? TOM: Yeah? Do you suppose Dad found the giant, or the giant found him? TOM: No. The giant found him way up in the mountain. Your dad wasn't going that far. I guess not. [music playing] Oh, it's my transistor. Something's wrong with it. No kidding. Yeah. Sometimes a bump starts it off and you got to hit it again to stop it. [loud gulping] [music playing] Oh, I must have bumped it again. You must have! Hey, have you been at this? Those things were Dad's. What? The food. I didn't touch it. Well, I sure didn't. And look at-- [music playing] What'd you do that for? Listen, if he comes back for that club, we don't want to be anywhere around here. [crowing] ROXY: Tom, look! TOM: What? It's Dad's camera. Are you sure it is? Well, I borrowed it enough. [inaudible]. Well, he couldn't have dropped it. Well, then why didn't he pick it up? Well, it's broken. It's no good to him. Oh, well, it's also insured. Let's not kid ourselves. Let's not jump to conclusions either. Come on, let's try that next ravine. One way or the other. What do you say? I don't know. I'll climb up there aways and see if the buggy can get through. No, you'd better stay here. No! There's no reason for both of us going. We got to come back to the buggy anyway. Well, then we'll come back. I'm not going to sit here doing nothing. Oh, women. Look, you stay here with the buggy-- Nope. And drive it to meet me when I give you the signal. That'll save us both a trip. Come on. Oh, OK. Ah, the gun. Toss it. [gun cocks] Give me a blast on that horn if you see anything. Don't worry about that. [music playing] [wind howling] [screams] [honks] Roxy! Roxy! Roxy! Roxy, where are ya? [grumbling] Roxy. Roxy. Roxy? Roxy! Dad. Oh, Dad! Oh! Oh, are you hurt? I think my collarbone's broken. Here, let me help you. How did you get here? Well, we came looking for you, and we're both so worried that we didn't know what to do. No, no. No. No, no. No, no, no. She's mine. She mine. He understands you. Oh, we got a beautiful friendship going. Take it easy. Ah, Dad! Don't do anything to scare him. Me scare him? Smile. Smile. He likes your perfume. Smell all you want. Go ahead. What became of the others? What others? Keep smiling. You didn't come out here alone, did you? No. Tom's with me. I mean, he's out there some-- place. Hold still. He's just curious. Hold still. It's real. See? He's looking. What's he doing? Looking for lice, I believe. Be careful, honey. Take it easy. He won't hurt you. He hurt you! Nope. I did that myself when I fell on the camera. Dad, I think you better break this up before I scream. Tell him you're hungry. I'm not. Well, think of the alternative. I'm hungry. Yeah. Hungry. [grumbling] What are those? Those are his relatives. They're dead. Yes. Apparently for some time. Come on, Dad. Let's make a run for it. That won't work. The entrance is blocked. What are we to do? I don't know, but we'll think of something. He's telling his family all about you. He told them about me last night. Think how lonely he must be. I know whatever he is, he's a human being. What'll I do? It'll be all right. Play it by ear. Don't upset him. OK. MR. MILLER: He's telling them he has guests for dinner. How do you do? MR. MILLER: Well, that one looked like a very important ancestor. Shake hands with him, Roxy. ROXY: Oh, Dad! Oh, pleased to meet you. Doesn't he know they're dead? I think so. He just can't think himself to accept it. I'm not having any trouble. And how are you feeling today? Oh, that's fine. I can't eat anymore of this. Fake it. That's what I've been doing. Now I'm getting sick. Eegah. Is that his name? It might be. That's the word he says most of the time. Eegah. Oh, Dad, no. That's all I need now is a drink of sulfur water. Ew, I don't see how anybody can drink that horrible stuff. I guess it can't hurt me. Make it last as long as you can. He won't hurt you if you're doing something. A prehistoric gentleman, huh? Thank you. Well, here's to you. Blech, this water doesn't make you strong. You have to be strong to drink it in the first place. No, no. I'm still thirsty. Thank you. [gagging] What is it? Believe it or not, Dad, I'm going to look at his etchings. Oh, this is nice. No, no, this. I see what you mean. Dad! What is it? ROXY: Look at this drawing. It's me in my car. This one-- it's me! Roxy! Roxy! ROXY: If Eegah makes me drink any of this sulfur water, I'll die. We've got to keep him busy. I know. And it's not so bad, as a matter of fact. A bit bitter. It seems to have a certain quality that's good for you. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the sulfur in these walls isn't what's kept these giants alive all these years. You mean these giants have always been here? Where have you seen those before? In that cave in France. Exactly. Sure. Same style, same everything. Definitely prehistoric. Yes, I'd say that he and his tribe have always been here. Are there others? No, he's the last one. How can you be sure? I took a good look at his family. From the condition of the shrouds, I'd say the last one died 50, 100 years ago. How old does that make him? Oh, I wouldn't-- [groans] Here it comes. No. [birds chirping] [music playing] Roxy? Roxy? Roxy? [shrieks] It's you, Dad. Go see if the rocks in place are gone. Now's our chance. It's there. What are we going to do? What can I do? Help me back. I got to sit down. No! Don't touch it. It's got to be tied up or something, doesn't it? There's some aspirin in my gear bag. I don't see it. He brought it here. It must be around someplace. Keep looking. He probably hid it somewhere. Oh, here it is. The aspirin's in that small pocket. [coughs] Give me two. Drink a lot of water. It'll give you strength. [inaudible] bones, honey. It's got to be tied up or something, doesn't it? Nah. It feels pretty good-- Liar! That's no way to talk to your father. The trouble with you is I spoiled you. You sure did. What can I do? Nothing. I'll just sit here. How about if I watched your face or gave you a shave? It'll make you feel better. You've got all your junk here. OK. Shave down! [grumbling] Look, before he has a chance to block the entrance, I'll get his attention, you run out. And leave you? Do as I tell you. Not this time, Dad. You were lucky last night. He's had time to think about it. I'm not going to leave you to get your head bashed in. My father didn't raise me that way. [music playing] He brought me flowers. We've got to get his mind on something else. Make a production out of it. Sing, hum, whistle, come on. [harmonizing] Keep busy. Here he comes. He's interested. He almost forgot to shut the door. Well, that doesn't say much for my sex appeal. [harmonizing] MR. MILLER: Uh-huh. Now I suppose he wants a shave. MR. MILLER: Good. Give it to him. Anything to please the customer. MR. MILLER: Try these. There. Roxy, where are you? Roxy! MR. MILLER: Better watch it with that shaving barb. Roxy! [gunshot] Roxy! MR. MILLER: You did a better job of shaving him, Roxy. There. MR. MILLER: There's no way of telling how old that fella is. You're handsome. Smooth. MR. MILLER: I warned you, Roxy. Don't upset him. Tell me some more about your etchings. You like the pretty smell? Here, this is loaded with perfume. I'm going to try and get him to move the rocks. Mmm, these smell pretty too. Where did you get them? Out there? Yep, I really think you should put them in water. I guess you're right. There are plenty more out there. Hey, look at this. Look, look. See? Take it. I'll bet you haven't seen anything like that before. Don't you think it's pretty? Do you like it? Oh. Give him something else. Oh. What? I haven't got anything else. Wait, here. Here. That was a mistake. Don't get the idea I don't like you, but my father-- he can see us. He. Yeah, that's the idea. You move the rock, we can go outside. Oh, no! No. No, Eegah. Outside, you and me. Outside. MR. MILLER: No, save yourself! [inaudible]. MR. MILLER: Once you're outside, run! Come on. Outside. Eegah. Eegah, no. Eegah. Eegah. [growls] [screaming] [growls] [gunshot] Go after them. The dune buggy's just down the canyon. I can do it. Go on. [growls] Tom! Cool it, Roxy. Everything's all right. Dad. He's OK. He's waiting for us. Hi, kids. ROXY: Dad! Run, kids! Run! [engine revving] Take off! It won't start. Let me. Hurry! What's wrong with it? I rigged it so nobody could steal it. Out here? Dead end. [honking] [screaming] Which way? That way. Look! Everybody OK? And you? Just fine, Dad. Wowee, there he is. So long, high pockets. Eegah! Eegah! Eegah! [barking] George, you're drunk! Give me the keys to the car. Now, baby, I just had one. That's all, just one, baby. That's all. I just had one. One bottle. Hey, baby! You've had enough! Well, I'll show you when I've had enough. You do me a great injustice. The keys. I've had enough. Roxy? ROXY: I'm ready, Dad. Well, I'm not. You're going to have to help me. I can't manage the tie. Here, I'll do it. Ugh, does it have to be this one? Young lady, that happens to be one of my favorite ties. But the color. You gave it to me four years ago. Oh, why, it's lovely. Are you sure you're feeling well enough to go out tonight? Honey, we've got to go out. Well it's not anything special. It's just a party. Your whole gang will be there. Yeah. You can't avoid them forever. No. Some of them laugh a little. Well, find old Agnes Henderson. She'll laugh a lot. What'll happen to him? I don't know, but I'm certain we're doing the right thing. If we were to reveal that a giant actually exists, there'd be a whole army out there tracking him down like an animal. No, they wouldn't. We wouldn't let them. Honey, he's from another age. Another eon. [knocking] Come in. Hello, Mr. Miller. MR. MILLER: Hello, Tom. Wowdee, wow, wow! You sure look swell, Roxy. Thank you. I'll only be a minute. Is something wrong, Mr. Miller? MR. MILLER: We're just talking about our little adventure. Oh, I see. MR. MILLER: You do? Sure. A girl like Roxy don't get over a thing like that right away. MR. MILLER: Doesn't? That's what I say! She's got to get her mind off it. And this hop tonight will help. MR. MILLER: Hop? Yeah, Mike Homlin's going to be there. Man, they swing. Oh, I understand. I'm ready. Well, let's split then. Ah, Mr. Miller, I got my dad's wheels tonight. Really? Do they fit on your car? You're funny, Mr. Miller. Real funny. Eegah. Eegah. Eegah! [screaming] What's he doing here? Call the police! Police! Call the police! [burps] Say, wait a minute, friend. What is this, a masquerade? That [inaudible] giant, darling. Oh, come on, you can talk plainer than that. Look out, [inaudible]. He's real. What did he say? He's real. Of course-- he's real? [yelling] [whistle blows] Jerry, quick, call police. There's an enormous giant here. [laughing] DISPATCH: 4900 block. Large man or a giant creating disturbance. Proceed with extreme caution. [siren wailing] [music playing] [music playing] [music playing] [music playing] [music playing] I don't blame you in the least. Oh, it's you, Dad. No, I don't. I agree with you 100%. Perhaps we should be a little more discreet about it. What on Earth are you talking about? Getting as far away as possible from that music. It's a good idea, but we're guests here. No, the music's wonderful. I can listen to Tom sing by the hour. MR. MILLER: And you have. I just wanted some fresh air, that's all. Is it, honey? No. Dad, I got the funniest feeling. What is it? I can't describe it, but I just know something's happened to him. Him? Eegah, the giant. Or whatever it is. Something's happened to him. Roxy, look at me. I love you very much. You're more like your mother every day. Every little thing was her personal concern, and she worried about it. That's just it, Dad. But you see, worry isn't the feeling that I have. I don't know what it is. He's a creature. Well, you just have to look at him to see that. He even tried to kill us. But, just-- but-- You can't get him out of your mind. That's my job for about two more years, if I can hold onto you that long. Then it'll be up to somebody else. Maybe him, huh? TOM: Hey! Where you been? I was belting out a tune just for you in there. I look up and you're gone. We can hear every word, Tom. I said "hear," not understand it. [siren wailing] You're funny, Mr. Miller. Really funny. Come on, Roxy, let's dance. Wait a minute. What's a matter? I thought I heard sirens. Oh, that's [inaudible]. [siren wailing] [screaming] No, no, mister. Go on. [siren wailing] [barking] Charlie, look out! [screaming] Don't shoot, Charlie! [music playing] If I didn't know they were dancing, I'd swear this was a fight. What? I say, it looks like a fight. My boy is a good dancer. I'm gonna get you! Knock it off, she's my girl! I'm gonna smash-- [screaming] Go get him! Come on, you guys. All right! Eegah! Eegah! No, no, stop, Eegah! Come on, let's go! No, no! Don't! [whimpering] There he is! Halt! Halt or I fire. [gunshots] Don't shoot! He doesn't understand! OFFICER: [inaudible]! [growling] Oh, no! [gunshots] MR. MILLER: Poor devil. Remember, I love you. GIRL: Where did he come from? BOY: Is he real? GIRL: Who is he? MR. MILLER: Yes, he was real. It says so in the book of Genesis. "There were giants on the Earth in those days." Chapter 4, verse 32.
