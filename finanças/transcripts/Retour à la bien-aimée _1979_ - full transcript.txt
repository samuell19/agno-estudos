Close ranks! And one... Well, it's okay. I can tell you are making efforts. But, believe me, there is more to it. You like dancing and you like music.

Goodbye, see you tomorrow. Goodbye kids. See you tomorrow. Aren't you leaving, Sir? No, I'll keep working. Don't forget to bring back the key, please. - See you tomorrow, Sir. - Goodbye, Madam. Return to the Beloved I'll do whatever you want. This picture is not very recent, but you will recognize her. Jeanne has remarried. Her name is now Kern. Jeanne Kern. Bring me a picture of you with them. Wherever, whenever, but you and them. Oh! Excuse me! I thought you were somebody else. I did what you asked. Here it is. You can have this one back. How did you do it? It was the end of the show, I had paid a photographer. They went out first. What kind of clothes was she wearing? Not this time, the other times. It's hard to tell... I was mostly observing their faces, their gestures. What was she wearing? Nothing out of the ordinary. A brooch, I think. And a suit, I believe. What does she eat? What does she drink? They drink white wine. I remember that vividly. Which white wine? I don't know. We used to drink white wine together, in brasseries. I saw your house. The Hespéride. How is it now? There is a big alley. Some sort of pergola, with plants and flowers. On the right is the park. Just nearby, two pine trees are planted around a small area of lawn. The swing is on the lawn. Then, the conservatory, through which one can enter the house. There are two steps between the conservatory and the living room. Departure P. 11pm Change... 00:30 sharp... Follow the plan hereunder. Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! Why do you always make me wait? Stéphane is still buying me Tintin books even though I already own them all. - Just give them to me. - Okay, if it pleases you... - Will you swing me, Thomas? - Okay, but you'll swing me after. Mysterious crime in Seine-et-Marne Sir! There is a letter for you. Julien, this is Jeanne. I suppose you have heard what happened. Thomas was shocked. He needs to see you. You should come, at least for a few days. You could live in our house. I told my husband, he agreed. You probably don't have any desire to see me again, but do it for Thomas. Come as fast as you can. Jeanne. Mr Julien... Julien! Why did you ring? That's what people do. Maybe I wanted to see you first. - No! You are too old now. - I may be old, but I'm still vigorous! I'll take your suitcase upstairs. And I'll let Jeanne know you are here. Hey, Thomas. Don't you recognize me? Come here. - Weren't you expecting me? - Mom told me you would come. - Have you brought me a present? - No, I was in a hurry. You'll have something very beautiful very soon. Come. Let's go see Mom. No, no. I'd rather wait for her. I'll just call her then. Goodbye, Madam. Good evening, I'm Dr Kahn. Stephan Kahn. Good evening. Does Jeanne know you are here? I think somebody told her. Did you have a nice trip? Very good, thanks. I'm sorry, I wanted to pick you up at the station but I'm working very late. I've lost so much time because of this story! You have an interesting job. Interesting? What do you mean, interesting? Well, yes... The sick persons, your clientele... This house is like a mill, a weird kind of clinic. Not at all. Why? There is nothing more than my consulting room here. By the way, this house was a godsend. For me, obviously, but most importantly for your son. Well I gave this house to Jeanne just for his benefit. I see you have met each other already. - Good evening, Julien. - Good evening, Jeanne. Elise and Thomas told me you had arrived. How are you doing? Very well, thank you. Thank you for coming so quick. I hope this hasn't caused you too much trouble. It has. Unfortunately, I, too, have a busy job. - And what is it? - Still doing concerts? No, only trivial shows. I only tinkle on the piano for a living. How long will you stay? I don't know. A few days? I'll see... Are you sure you are full? - Good night Mom. - Good night. - Good night Stéphane. - Good night. Can't I have a kiss? Good night Dad. Seeing that corpse has terrorized him. The questions from the journalists too. Thank you, Denise. - Sugar? - No. Do you still love me as much as you used too, Elise? Of course. Why? Thanks. Where was that corpse, precisely? Near the swing. Lying behind a pile of wood. - Had it been hidden? - No. The man wasn't carrying anything. Only a train ticket and his ID. Er? Kell? Keller. Why would this Keller come and be killed in the Hespéride? This... We have no clue about this. Do you want one? No, thanks. - You don't smoke as much as you used to. - Yes. And you... A bout this this story, How do you feel about it? That's not why I came here. I understand. How many disks do you own? I don't know exactly. Approximately... 300. Dance with me. - Now? - Yes. I haven't danced in years, I don't know if I can still do it. This kind of thing is unforgettable. I'm feeling dizzy, I'm not used to it anymore. We will have to fix this window someday. It was forced open. We have been burglarized last summer. What was stolen? Jewels. Nothing important. Has the burglar been caught? No, not yet. The weather is windy tonight. People say it helps you sleep well. - See you tomorrow. - Good night. Come, I'll show you your room. Here is the bathroom. You'll share it with Thomas. Is this still the guest room? You could say that. It's kind of my room, too. Your room? You have your own room. This... is where I work. Collages? Yes. I turn them into books now. Children's books. I didn't know. I can remove all of this if it disturbs you. No, no. It's not disturbing me. I'll leave you now. You know... I never stopped playing the piano. I'm just not interested in concerts anymore. Why? You know very well why. Good night, Julien. Good night. Papa. Julien. What did you say? The bunk bed. Do you remember it? Where were we going? You were going to Marseilles. To meet your mother. How old was I? Two, two-and-a-half years. I don't remember Marseilles. I only stay there for a few hours. Sleep now. I'm cold. You could have waited before opening the window. Thomas is waiting for you in the park. Do you know what time it is? It's 9 a.m. Oh! Julien! Right on time! Let me introduce you to Inspector Corbin, who is in charge of the investigation. Well, I'll leave you. Somebody is waiting for me. Let's go outside, if you please. We'll chat a bit. Karl told me you don't know anything. Only a few things about his identity: Keller. Nobody saw him? He had arrived by train in the evening. He read a paper near the train station. Then he walked. He didn't appear to have any appointment. - Did he talk to anybody? - Nobody. Do you understand anything? To not understand a thing... is already knowing something. See, this was found near the body. R. K.? You won't go far with only two letters. I hope this "investigation", as Dr Kern call it, isn't too much of a hassle for your wife. You mean my ex-wife. Yes, excuse me. What about your son? He seemed happy to see you. Yes, I think so. This is a very beautiful house. Or strange, at least. I heard it belongs to you. Yes, this is my family's house. - I inherited it from my grand-mother. - Your grand-mother? - Are your parents dead? - No. But I never see them. And this house... Is of no interest to you now? Thomas is living here. And the Kern couple, too. When I broke up with Jeanne, the whole world stopped for me. I'm a pianist. I know. I was beginning to have some renown, make a concert from time to time. I was working ten hours a day and I stopped everything. I accompany dance lessons, I teach... It lets me earn a living. - Are you looking for something? - One never knows. Right here, near the body, this was found. Have a look. Listen to me. Listen to me. You'll have all the time you want to answer. I'm sorry about yesterday. When I received your letter in Paris, I thought you were calling for me. I had been waiting for that moment for five years. I have been living with you all that time. I never stopped loving you. I've never loved you so much than during these five years. It wasn't a separation for me. It was a travel. Some kind of absence. I knew I would meet you again some day. That you would come back to me. That you would ask me to come back to you. Jeanne... Do you... Have you talked to Corbin? Yes. Yes. Has he learnt something? Nothing you don't know yet. The crime was committed on the lawn, near the swing. The gunshot probably made the body fall behind the coppice. - During the night? - Yes, during the night. What time? Around 00:00, 00:30, I don't know. I wasn't asleep yet. How come I haven't heard anything? I can't answer that. Are you sure you don't know him? The pictures don't ring a bell. Look at this one. No. I don't know him. I'm sorry. And you didn't hear the gunshot? No. - Neither have you, Mrs Kern. - No. I was probably already asleep. - I imagine you own a gun. - Yes. Would you mind showing it to me? Not at all. I can't find it. When have you seen it for the last time? I don't remember. A long time ago. - You haven't moved it, right? - No. Maybe it was stolen during the burglary? - You were burglarized? - Yes. When? In August, while we were out of town. I hadn't noticed it had vanished. I understand. It doesn't matter. This is a power supply problem. It happens sometimes. Does it last long? It depends. Have a good time. I'll join you soon. Why did you come back, exactly? I didn't want to come back. Jeanne asked me to come. I'm going to bed too. Good night. Blow out the candle when you leave the room. It must be very cold outside. Good night! What is this? - It's a revolver! - Put it back in the handkerchief. - Let's put it in our hut. - Yes, okay. Thomas! - Where are you going? - Over there, at the far end. What are you hiding? Nothing. - Show it to me. - It's nothing, Mom. Let me see it. Don't hold it like this Where did you find it? In the tree. Go and play now. Come in. Thomas found this. In one of the pine trees. It this your husband's? Yes, I think so. Did you tell him? No. Why? I don't know. I wanted to tell you first. Give it to me. - Will you tell Stéphane? - That won't be necessary. What do you mean? - What are you thinking? - Nothing. I don't think anything. Give me the revolver. And don't tell your husband. That's all. Trust me. As you can see, the lines on the capital P are slightly erased on their lower part, in both cases. Also, the S, in both cases are not exactly at the same level. As you can see. Isn't it due to the typing? No, this is too distinct. Both texts were typed on the same machine. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. By the way, look at this... Did you have fun with the letters game? Yes. And here is more. Do you recognize this handkerchief? J. K. J. R. K. is Keller. J. K. is Jeanne Kern, isn't it? I never knew Jeanne had an embroidered handkerchief. Where did you find this? In a tree. In a tree? Yes. It's... Thomas who found it. - And he gave it to you? - No. It was Jeanne. If it is this weapon that killed Keller, I'll have to take a decision. Between who and what? There is the typewriter. There is the revolver and the handkerchief. There is Kern and there is your wife. Sorry. Your ex-wife. Jeanne? Haven't you thought of her? I have. You can see... I can't. I can't imagine Jeanne doing such a thing. I know. It must be weird to see her again after all this time. She hasn't changed. For five years I've led the life I had to lead. With a man who loves me very much. With you, thing were different. I haven't forgotten and I won't forget anything. It's dead. What's going on? The judge made a decision. He must have had a good reason. - The revolver? - Yes. It belongs to Kern. He killed Keller. - Did they arrest him? - No. The judge wants to question him, that's all. Come. Give me your hands. I think you understood. No. Nothing at all. You are not under arrest. Despite the appearances, you are not. What am I doing here then? Let's say that, for our friend Julien, you are under arrest. And maybe for your wife too. For both of them, that's all. Only the two of them. Your little game is rather complicated. Complicated? No. It's only necessary. Do you have a favorite hotel in this region? - Will Stéphane be left for long? - No, he will probably come back tonight. So it's only the three of us now. Your hair is dirty. Let's go, I'll shampoo you. - Let me know if I have a phone call. - Of course. Hurry up. - Can I ask for a favor? - What favor? Allow Thomas to go to bed five minutes later. I brought you a present. - My present? What is it? - You'll see. It's Mom. Yes. Who is that baby? It's you! It's here! - Yes. You recognize the conservatory? - Yes. It's over. You can turn on the light. - Already? - Already. Thanks, Dad. Is it really mine? Yes. I told you, it's your present. But we don't have movies, only pictures. It's not as good. - Can I go get them, Mom? - As you wish. Where was it? Last summer, I think. During Salzburg festival. I didn't remember this picture. It's him! Who, him? The dead, it's him! Good night. Good night Mom. Good night Dad. This is too much, Julien. Way too much. It's frightening. Jeanne? Does it hurt? No, it's nothing. Thank you. You should sleep now. Julien. Julien, I want you to leave. To leave this place. Tomorrow. As soon as possible. Don't leave. Stay. Stay. Did you have a nice trip? I'd like to speak to Mrs Kern. - What are you doing?- - Nothing, just having a walk. You know, you can spend a lifetime with someone and never really know him. Your husband, for example, you say he is innocent. But you hid from him that his children have found his revolver. I wanted to let Julien know first. I can tell you we have a lot of questions about you. Will he be kept for a long time? Your husband? Yes. What can I say? Everything is against him. If he wanted to kill that man, he wouldn't have called him here. He wouldn't have used his own typewriter. Nor his own revolver. Maybe that's why he thought he was clever. What were you doing, that night? Thomas went to bed rather late. I stayed with him. Then I stayed in my room. What was Kern doing in the meantime? He listened to music in the living room for an hour, an hour and a half. That's what he told us. What about that gunfire nobody heard? You should have heard it. I haven't heard anything. Only the music. One record lasts around twenty minutes. It was enough time for him to go out... To kill Keller... And come back. This is totally absurd. Is it? That's your own opinion. Do you know who is behind you on this picture? Keller himself. Yes. Did you know him or not? I only found this picture yesterday. I didn't know it existed. My son recognized him. Was Julien here? Yes. That Keller... You didn't know him? Are you sure? I am. Last year... You were in Salzburg. And in Beirut also. Yes? Keller was going to the same festival as you. All of you. He was a music lover. Isn't it curious? He slept in the same hotel as you. Every time. Who was that Keller? I don't know. Apart from his tracks, we know nothing. Were you the one who asked Julien to come? Yes. Because of Thomas. I understand. - Can I walk with you? - Of course! It's naughty to eavesdrop. It's not by accident that this person got killed here. See you very soon. You will leave me alone? Didn't you ask first? I need you. Goodbye, Axel. I thought you would forget me easily. I thought so too. You should have come back sooner. I've been waiting for you. Then when you came back I was afraid. Who was that Keller? Some guy. I knew things about him. He did what I asked him. He couldn't do otherwise. That picture from Salzburg... You wanted him to be photographed with us. And the burglary last summer. It's you? And the typewriter. The revolver. That picture, in the middle of the others. You told Keller to come here and you killed him. When the train passed, right? Yes. It was impossible to hear the gunfire. All this just for you. I'm back. Mom, are you here? I brought your jewellery back. Here. Now, we will elope. We will take Thomas. We will leave, the three of us. No, I can't. What? I won't leave with you. What are you saying? I won't leave with you. Why, at the train station? Why... Here, this afternoon? I don't know. I can't. Subtitles: tadanobu@KG Proofreading: flipflink
