We're starting here? Okay. 我从刚出生起 就很会为自己发声 From the very beginning I've always made a statement. 不是每个人都喜欢这样 Not everyone appreciated that. 真不幸 That's unfortunate. 不过我并不用迎合所有人 But I wasn't for everyone. 说到发声 这就有一个 Speaking of statements, here's one. 我就是因为这条项链死的 That necklace is the reason I'm dead. 不过这话说得有点早 But I'm getting ahead of myself. 很小的时候 我就意识到我眼中的世界 From an early age, I realized I saw the world 和其他人不一样 differently than everyone else. 你看 Look! 样式不对 你得照着这个样式来 Well, that's not the pattern. You have to follow the pattern. 凡事都有一套固定的方式 There's a way of doing things. -这样很丑 -包括我妈妈 - That's ugly. - Including my mother. 真伤人 That's cruel. 你叫埃斯特拉 不是库伊拉[无情女] Your name's Estella, not Cruella. 我挑战的不是她 It wasn't her I was challenging, 而是这个世界 it was the world. 我妈妈当然清楚这点 But of course my mother knew that. 这正是她所担心的 That's what worried her. 记住 你和其他人一样有资格来这 Remember, you belong here as much as anyone. 有你加入是他们的幸运 They're lucky to have you. 同意 Agreed. 库伊拉想出来的时候 你该对她说什么 What do you say to Cruella when she tries to get the better of you? 谢谢你来 但你现在可以走了 Thank you for coming, but you may go now. 很好 现在跟她道别吧 Good. Now say goodbye to her. 再见 库伊拉 Goodbye, Cruella. 戴上帽子 And wear the hat. 我不需要帽子 I don't need the hat. 要有礼貌 听老师的话 Well, be polite. And good. 友好一点 And friendly. 那句话怎么说来着 How does the saying go? "我是女人 听我怒吼" "I am woman. Hear me roar." 出自澳洲女歌手海伦·瑞迪 1971年的女权主义名曲 《I Am Woman》 不过1964年还没有这句话 Well, that wasn't much of a thing back in 1964, 但它即将横空出世 but it was about to be. 你好 我叫埃斯特拉 Hi, my name's Estella. 看啊 有只臭鼬跑进这栋楼了 Look. A skunk's got loose in the building. 外套不错 Nice jacket. 你好 我是安妮塔 Hi, I'm Anita. 我是埃斯特拉 Estella. 别理他们 Ignore them. 我没理 但可能撑不了多久 Just did. But it might not last. "别理他们" "Ignore them"? 我刚才不是说 "听我怒吼"吗 Didn't I just say, "Hear me roar"? 打起来 打起来 打起来 Fight! Fight! Fight! 有些人并不能接受 That didn't sit well with some people. 我要给你记过一次 This is a blot on your copybook. 好吧 很多人都不能接受 Okay, that didn't sit well with a lot of people. 够了 Enough. 她活该 She deserved it! 不过我在意想不到的地方找到了朋友 But I found friends in unlikely places. 你好啊 Hello. 比如这个小家伙 Like this guy. 有只狗吗 There's a dog? 它叫巴迪 是我捡的 Buddy.

What a fabulous name. 可以说 我整个小学生涯 You could say I pretty much roared my way 都在怒吼中度过 through all of primary school. 几乎整个 Almost. 接下来会怎么样应该很清楚了 Well, I think it's clear what happens now. 埃斯特拉 你被开除... Estella, you are expelled... 我要帮她办理退学 I'm withdrawing her from your school. 是我要开除她 I'm expelling her. 太迟了 因为我先帮她退学了 It's too late because I withdrew her first, 所以那不能记录在她档案里 so that can't be on her record. 我之前就说了开除 我已经说了 I'd said expelled. I'd already said it. 你后说的 Hadn't. 你没说 Didn't. 容我说一句 似乎贵校培养出的孩子品性恶劣 And might I say, your school seems to turn out horrible children 创造力匮乏 毫无同情心 with no creativity or compassion. 还有愚昧鲁钝 Or genius. 你出局了 You're out. 出去 Out! 身为天才是一回事 Being a genius is one thing. 抚养一个天才 却要面临着诸多挑战 Raising a genius, however, does come with its challenges. 伦敦 我们来了 London, here we come! 这也是没办法的事 Well, we don't really have a choice. 你没学可上 这没什么值得庆祝的 You have no school. It's nothing to celebrate. 反正 Well... 小镇也培养不出时装设计师 Can't be a fashion designer in a small town anyway. 我们可以去这里吗 Can we go here? 摄政公园吗 完美 Regent's Park?

Just us. 他说得对 我是个逃犯 He was right. I was a fugitive. 她又开始哭了吗 Is she crying again? 她妈妈死了 你记得那种感觉的吧 Her mum died.
