Subtitles by Obscuritron Get in..! Get in for Christ's sake! - Who the hell are you? - Get your head down, it's gonna get rough. Hold tight! We've done it! Okay, thanks mister. But let me out of here. Just let me off! I was paid to do a job, and I'm gonna finish it. Hey, stop! Don't run my love. Don't be afraid of me baby. Who are you? Come on my girl. I'll help you. Come on. - What kept you? - We lost you a couple of times- and then we got held up at the crossing. Thanks. - Mister... - Yeah? I want to thank you... for saving my life. That's what I'm here for. - How did you know...? - About tonight? We've been keeping watch on you for the last couple of weeks. The KGB want you, and they want you real bad. The KGB? Why? Come on. I'll drive you home. I'll tell you on the way. I must go to the club, I'm singing tonight. Okay. I'll take you there. Who where those other guys? The one's in black? Ninja. Ninja? Thanks for watching me out back there. I'm sorry if I seemed ungrateful. - When did you last see your father? - I suppose you're the CIA? - And those hitters, were they KGB? - Yes. - It was a joke and some very bad taste. - It's not a joke. His new work is very important. He has realised that if he gives it to the Russians- the balance of power between east and west will be destroyed. He is defecting back to the west. He wants you there... When we go to meet him. I haven't seen my father since I was a tiny child. I can hardly remember him. I have a new name and a new life. It was his choice to go to Russia. To leave his family. Why should he want me now? You're the only person left who he trusts. Then I pity him. I always believed the CIA were Americans. You obviously haven't read many thrillers. You ought to smile more often. It suits you. You still haven't told me your name? Mason. Call us mercenaries if you like. We work for whoever pays the highest. Right now we think the KGB knows what has happened. That's why they tried to get you tonight. Your father will be taken out of Russia tonight. We are here to protect you and take you to him when he gets to Sweden. The question is, Mason... How can I trust you? Why should I? You said yourself that you're a mercenary. So you could be working for the Russians. (Announcer) Okay boys and girls, here she is live tonight at the Atlantic Club. Give her a big hand - our one and only Nadja! Damn! - Get rid of him. - Okay, okay. Come here. - Professor Markov? - Yes, that's me. What took you so long? - We had to wait for the fog. - Are we ready to leave? - Yes. Are you ready, professor? - Yes, I have all my notes here. Okay, let's go. Everything is under control, professor. Cover us! Let's get the hell out of here! - How many guys have you got in there? - Four. I guess it'll be okay then if I get some rest? Yeah, don't worry. They won't do anything. - Can I borrow your car? - Sure. It's parked around the back. - Thanks. - But be careful. I'll go in and have a look. They seem to like her. - How's your leg, Johnny? - I'm all right, don't worry. We've done it professor. We are on our way to freedom. Thank you. Thank you. Shit..! Just take it easy... Your papers? Where are you taking us? One of our agents is waiting at the coast. - You know him. Alex. - Yeah. A helicopter will pick us up and take us to Sweden. Why all these changes? I got new instructions today, someone has betrayed us. - The KGB knew that you were coming. - Who told you this? - I'm not allowed to tell you. - You can trust her. She's been my assistant for the last three years. I hope you're right, Professor. I usually am. We'll be in Sweden in a couple of hours. Just sit back and relax. Wonderful. - Where are the others? - Dead. I'm sorry. They were good men. I was so worried when I saw the Russian helicopter. - Camouflage. It's really Swedish. - Oh yes. I understand. Shit! - Mason? - Hello sir. Markov has been intercepted. Only one of our men has survived the rescue attempt. The Russians have taken Markov. If they can make him believe that he has been rescued- - if he thinks he's safe in Sweden, he'll complete the work. - What can we do? - We still got his daughter. Correction - they've got his daughter. I've lost her. This is an invitation to world war. You have surpassed yourself. Listen Mason - and listen good. You're to take the ninja into Russia and get Markov out. This is based on the sedative gun, with a video assist. Accuracy is essential. The dart that it fires can pierce the toughest clothing. It has find an artery leading to a major organ, like the heart or the brain. A lethal dose of poison enters the blood stream- which on reaching the brain or the heart causes the organ to explode. Very dramatic. Exactly. It's main use is as a deterrent to would-be heroes. And these little gadgets... Conventional looking enough- - but unlike others we've used in the past these can be perfectly synchronized. They also do not require an operator once they have been set. Time bombs - but more efficient. No one can stop them even if we're all killed. The place will blow up no matter what they try. What a comforting thought. I was just catching up on my beauty sleep. Who are you? His name is Michail Bukowski. If you read my report you know where we're headed. The testing plant at Kotlas. It's a bit of a drive from the port, so I suggest- you follow my example and sleep whilst you can. I came to bring you these, Mason. Only managed to get hold of them this morning. How on earth did you get a hold of these? A subversive network is always more efficient than a bureaucracy. - If it were we wouldn't be here, right? - There you have a point. - Welcome to Sweden, Professor. - It's good to be home. This is Natassia Karenski, she's been my assistant for the past three years. - It was too dangerous to leave her. - Good to meet you, Natassia. My name is Abelman. I'm from the United Nations. Good to meet you, Mr. Abelman. This way please. Wait til you see this, Markov! This way. What you see here Professor, is the most advanced- and largest secret testing plant in Europe. We have been working with your old systems for some years. Very impressive. But if my new system works, you won't need any secrecy any more. I'll take you through to your rooms. - Well? - Here. I suppose this is a joke? A romantic novel. Just a precaution. In these pages rests the future of mankind. To anyone who has read them, they will have seen a love story - a novel about peace. But buried in these words is a code so complex that only I can unravel it. All my work on nuclear fission control. It will revolutionize energy production throughout the world. Make real what has only been dreamed of for the past 50 years. I intend to make it possible for every nation to have access to this system. The scientists will not be betrayed again. This time we are working for peace. - I want to see my daughter. - Of course, Professor. Get ready. - Hi there, just our usual check. - Sure, it's down below. - Down there. - Thanks. - Oh, good! - It's not for you. It's for her. You can go now. Nadja. Nadja! - You're all right. You're safe. - Who are you? My name is Abelman. The United Nations envoy. We have your father. Everything is okay. - There is some tea here, if you want it. - Your people sure have a way with women. Well, I see. You had enough time to pack my things. We had to drug you. I'm sorry, there was not time to explain. Where are we, Mr. Abelman? We are still in Sweden. That's all I can tell you. - What was the last thing you remember? - I'm not sure, but... I'm told that you were talking to a man in the club. What was he saying? A man? Oh yes, I remember him. Was he part of your operation? No. He was with the Russians. - Shame. I liked him. - You are lucky you're still alive. He saved my life! I don't think he would have killed me. Once he got what he wanted, he would have killed you. Believe me. - My instincts were right then. - What did he tell you? Something about my father. You know, if you'd just paid me a visit I'd come along quite freely We couldn't risk you changing your mind. My fathers work is so important, you had to do all of it? You bet it is..! - I wonder if he is how I remember him... - He is waiting for you - now. Father... Father! - Is that really you? - Yes, it's me! Nadja, my child - finally after all these years! I though I never would see you again. I hated you so much for leaving me alone. I didn't want to see you again. But now, when you are here before me... I'm really happy! - I am happy too, Nadja. - But why did you do it? Leaving a little girl on her own like that... It's difficult to explain, my child. It was like destiny was calling me. I had something to give to the world... ...to make it a better place to live. I just had to go. - I've been so alone. - Oh Nadja. I've missed you so much. There have been so many times when I just wanted- to leave everything and come back to you. I had to complete it. But now... Now that I have finished- -all I want is to become a father again. And I wish you would let me to be... To become one. I'm very old. Very tired. God knows have many years I've got left. Don't say any more father... I am happy to have a family again. - What's in the back? - In the back? Just a lot of fish. Look! Over there! Watch out! Come on, let's go. Okay, listen carefully. We'll drive around through here. There is a cave that runs above the road at that point. The cave leads through the ventilation systems under the castle. Mike will wait for us outside. We've got thirty minutes. Then he'll start driving... ...whether we are there or not. Understood? - How much has he done? - Just over half. But only he knows which sentences to use from his novel. You must call me when he is near to the end. What are you going to do with him then? Kill him...! We have 30 minutes from... now. Good luck. You got a cigarette? - They really fooled you, didn't they? - What are you talking about? You are still in Russia, Professor Markov. Still in Russia? Are you crazy? We are the people you should've come to. I'm afraid your assistant betrayed you. It was she who shot the other agents in Leningrad. This is a cover operation by the KGB to steal- your formula and claim it as their own. What you are decoding here is your, and the rest of the world's death warrant. Professor - you must realise... Take him away. Where are the rest of you? Where?! It's him! They fooled you too, have they? This is a setup! - How many were with him? - Five or six. You better put the whole station on alert. How come you are giving the orders? - Okay, take her to the lab. - Keep an eye on him. Sorry Mr. Abelman... Or whatever your name really is. Nothing on the earth will induce me to continue with the decoding. Then I am afraid you leave me no alternative. - What are you going to do? - You will see. - Keep an eye on him. - Okay. Well, Professor? Are you ready to continue? I have no intention of giving my secrets to you. - It's too important to the world. - You are talking crap. All right..! - What are you doing?! - You leave us no choice. - I'm sorry... - No! No! Stop it Abelman, stop it! All right... You win. - I carry on. - You're a wise man, Professor. I'll leave him to you now. I don't think he'll us more trouble. And I put my trust in you... You little bitch. Stop it! Father..! Destroy my work, my love... Or it will destroy you. Father! - I'm sorry Nadja. We have to leave. - No! Come on! What the hell...? - Enemy attack! - Attention all units - red alert! Prepare for attack now! Execute plan four. I repeat, execute plan four! Gas in the main complex! Attention! Gas! All units to complex center. Return to base. Do you hear me? - Where are the others? - Dead. Jump in! Full speed to roadblock 84. Fugitives on way to the border. Right, we are on our way. Step on it, Grisha. Don't let them pass. - Mr. Daniels, I am... - Abelman. Yes, I know. The farm boy from Connecticut who wants to be the great, red peoples hero! - So... Mason blew it? - Yes, he failed - but I didn't. - Let's trade. - What have you got? What you came for. Tom, take a look at these. So... What's the price? Enough dough to live comfortably in New York for the rest of my life. What do you say? Worth anything? We've had this crap for years already. There's nothing new here. It looks like all you've got here is a... romantic novel. But it was complete..! That son-of-a-bitch. Mason must have it! So you did it again? You got the papers? My best agent. A ninja. Mason... Hand them over. - Mason, no! - I must give them what they've paid for. Damn you! You're fired! Wait! Don't go! Wait! Wait, don't go! I've got it! No, Daniels, no! Wait! Maybe you can sell it to "Reader's Digest"? No, don't go! I got it! Hey, wait for me! Keep yourself warm, baby! Go fuck an Eskimo! So my father gave his life for a handful of confetti... No. Not confetti. For this. And I think you have to decide what to do with it. - But what did you give them? - My resignation.
