Haven't you read the new warning? (Pac-Man) 'Hm. "Caution.' '"The ghost monster general has determined' that chomping is hazardous to your health." Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you haven't read my new warning. It's right here. I-I can't read the fine print. chomp In case you missed it, it says "Never look a Pac-Man in the mouth." (Inky) 'Pinky, Sue, hold up!'

Maybe it's a UFO. (Pac-Man) 'Yeah, and look at that weird alien' 'with the hairy face and the red space suit.' Oh! Poor little animal. Pac-Baby, watch out! [cooing] Careful. He could be dangerous. What's all the ruckus now? Poppin' Power Pellets! An invader from Mars! I think they need help, Paccy. - Are you okay? - I think so. - Where am I? - You're in Pac-Land. Pac-Land? That's funny. I've been all over the world and I don't remember hearing of Pac-Land. Oh, my, speaking of world I must be way behind schedule. I've got to get cracking. [bells jingling] crack [sleigh creaking] Oh, it's no use. What I need is a flying tow truck and all my elves are off for the evening. [stammering] [sneezes] Bless you. Heh-heh. Uh-oh, what you need is a warm fire and some Power-Pellet coa. chomp [instrumental music] Mm-hmm. This stuff sure is good! Thank you, uh.. Ms. Pac-Man but you can call me Pepper. But say, who are you anyway? And what are you behind schedule for? You mean, you really don't know? Why, I'm Santa Claus. And I'm late with my Christmas deliveries. - Christmas? - What's that? You've never heard of Christmas? Why, it's the most wonderful time of the year. 'It's the season of giving and receiving.' 'A time of peace on Earth' 'and goodwill towards man.' Christmas sure sounds wonderful, alright. We've never had anything like that in Pac-Land. Now you see why I must get airborne. I've got a long list of good little boys and girls who I've got presents for. [gasps] My bag of toys! I must have lost them in the crash. Oh, dear. The world's counting on me. I've never missed a Christmas yet. Gosh, this is awful, Paccy. Oh, well, don't worry, Santa. We'll save Christmas for you. But my sleigh, the reindeer.. We'll fix your sleigh. And I'll have your reindeer purring by the time it's ready. But what about the presents? Without them, my reindeer and sleigh won't be of any use. [laughs] Just leave everything to me. clang clang clang - 'Be careful, Pac-Man.' - 'Don't worry, Santa.' We'll have you back in the air before midnight. [sputtering] bleep bleep [coughing] Whoo. I never knew I had such big feet. Get into your ghost suit before you get a real sock. 'Whoa!' I'm getting sick and tired of that Pac-nerd always getting the best of us. Yeah. What we need is a taste of sweet revenge. Yeah, I say we net him. - Like this. - Hey! And then we can drench him in chocolate sauce. - Like this. - What? [sputtering] And then we can chomp all over him, like this. [screaming] Uh, we didn't mean it, Clyde. [screaming] [instrumental music] Oh, boy. We've gotta find that bag of toys, Chomp Chomp. Chomp Chomp? clonk [snorting] Good boy, now follow that trail! ♪ Dashing through the snow ♪ ♪ O'er the fields we go ♪ ♪ In a three ghost monster sleigh ♪ ♪ Chomping all the way Ho ho ho ♪♪ Hold it, fellas. I think I saw something. [screaming] It was over here somewhere. There it is! (Clyde) Yeah, but what is it? Uh, it's just an old sack. Yeah, and all it's got in it is a bunch of toys. Toys? (all) Toys! Yippee! Toys, toys, toys! Whoo-whoo! Br-r.. [mumbling] [laughs] We struck it rich! Oh, we just got to find those toys, Chomp Chomp. (Clyde) 'Yippee! Toys, toys..' Sounds like someone's having a good time! - 'Toys!' - Oh, no! (Pac-Man) 'The ghost monsters have found Santa's sack of toys!' We gotta figure a way to get it back! [snorting] Oh, great idea, Chomp Chomp. We'll burrow our way under the snow and grab the sack. Come on! Hey, that's mine! I saw it first! Aha! Ha-ha. Right on the mark. Well, well, look who's come to play with us. [groaning] Come on, fellas. Let's chomp him. [dramatic music] So the mighty Pac-Man thought he could sneak up and chomp on us, did he? Yeah! Well, we ain't as dumb as we look. On second thought, maybe we are. Gimme that, you idiot. [glass shattering] Oh, but you don't understand. All I want are the toys. Aw, ain't that cute? All he wants are the toys. Come on, let's quit wasting time and chomp on his bones. Well, you know what I always say. If you can't beat 'em, run! whoosh [instrumental music] Quick, Chomp Chomp, get the toys! [snorting] Don't worry about me. You've gotta save Santa's toys! [snorting] Hey, Pac-Man's pooch is takin' our toys. Let's get him, Blinky. Let's chomp the little chump. [snorting] Where did he go? In there. Hurry, before we lose him. Well, what do you know? I think I'm gonna get away. Yikes! That good-for-nothing Pac-pup ditched us. (Sue) Yeah, well, Pac-Man didn't. [groans] We'll be seeing ya, Pac-punk. Don't take any wooden Power Pellets. [laughs] [instrumental music] slurp slurp slurp Oh, good boy, Chomp Chomp. [panting] You got the toys. I just, I just hope I have enough strength to make it back. [groans] Hey, that sanding disc must be in here somewhere. Hah! Here it is. [whirring] It was the night before Christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring.. [squeaking] ...not even a Pac-mouse. [laughs] 'The stockings, uh' 'were hung by the chimney with care..' '...in the hopes that Saint Nicholas' 'soon would be there.' Oh, how you doin', fellas? Well, your temperature's okay, Rudolph but your warning light's still flickering. [dramatic music] Oh, oh, I, I don't think I.. I don't think I can make it, Chomp Chomp. Ooh.. slurp slurp slurp [snorting] Oh! It's home! Oh, maybe we can make it. Chomp Chomp, look out! [both screaming] crash Oh, no! Look at this mess. And it's 20 minutes to midnight! Ah. Well, come on, Chomp Chomp. We can't let Santa down. Your sleigh is all fixed, Santa. Yup, and the work comes with a five-year 50,000 chomp warranty. [chuckles] You get it, chomp warranty? Ha! Gosh! I wonder what's taking Paccy so long! I'd hate for you to miss your deadline. Never mind my deadline. I just hope your Pac-Man is okay. [feeble knocking] whoosh [gasps] Oh, Paccy. Are you alright? Oh, heh-heh.. Just fine, Pepper, huh.. [glass shattering] Oh, no. I guess he never found Santa's sack. [snorting] Dada found it! Dada found it! [chuckles] Thanks, Pepper. I feel better already. Looks like we saved Christmas for you after all! I'm afraid not. It's just too late. - Oh. - Oh. - Oh. - Oh. [snorting] This is the first Christmas I've missed in all of history. [sobbing] Oh, there must be some way, Santa. Thanks for trying, Pac-Man. But even if my reindeer were jet-propelled I couldn't make it in time. Wait! Jet propelled! That's it! We can still save Christmas! (Pac-Man) Santa, get your sleigh and reindeer and follow me! [instrumental music] vroom [sleigh bells jingling] Where are we going, Paccy? Don't worry, Pepper. We'll be there any second. Uh, or will we? Hold it right there, Pac-Man. screech Whoa! [reindeers neighing] Looks like we get to chomp the whole neighborhood this time. Yeah. Let's stop talkin' and start chompin'. I know it'll never work but I've got to try to reason with them. Come on, hold it. You can't chomp us! We can't? Shucks. And here I thought it was still chomping season. Come back here, ghost-brains! We can chomp on Pac-Man all we want! (Pac-Man) No, wait. You see, we're on an emergency mission. We're the only chance Santa Claus has of saving Christmas. [sleigh bells jingling] - Santa Claus? - Christmas? That's right. Christmas. It's a time for spreading joy throughout the world. It's a time for warmth and brotherly love. Does that include ghost brothers? Uh, of course. Forget it, Pac-Man. Your clever talk ain't gonna get you out of this mess. Oh, wait, you don't understand. I'm not doing this for me. Just think of the millions of deserving children around the world 'who won't get their Christmas presents' 'if you open your mouths instead of your hearts.' [all wailing] - Ah, what a bunch of humbug. - Aw. [sniffles] Give the guy a break, Clyde. Yeah. [sniveling] Think of all the little kids, Clyde. And the big kids, too, Clyde. Alright, already. Just this once, Pac-Man. But remember, when Christmas is over, we'll be back! Oh, thanks. You won't regret this. whoosh [sleigh bells jingling] vroom [sleigh bells jingling] There it is, the Power Forest. [sleigh bells jingling] [brakes screeching] [sleigh bells jingling] I don't know what you've got in mind, Pac-Man but it's just no use. I might as well face it. I've missed my first Christmas. Ah, don't give up yet, Santa. There's the answer to your problems. (Santa) Power Pellets? Methinks Paccy's gone whacky. But who are the Power Pellets for, Pac-Man? The reindeer. Who else? Go on, give 'em a chomp. crunch crunch crunch [laughs] My, my, my. I've never seen Rudolph's nose glow so bright. There just may be a chance after all. Hurry! There's no time to lose! - Good luck, Santa! - So long, take care! (Santa) Lead on, Rudolph! [sleigh bells jingling] Bye, bye, Santa! (Santa) Thanks again! Goodbye! Oh, I just hope we were able to help him save Christmas. Come on, Paccy, it's cold out here. 'Let's go home.' Paccy, look! [giggling] (Santa) 'Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!' We did it! We saved Christmas! Oh, gosh! Look at all the presents! [laughs] This one's for you, Morris. And here's yours, Officer O'Pac. Chomp Chomp, Sour Puss. Pac-Baby. [giggling] (Blinky) But I thought we weren't gonna chomp them tonight. (Clyde) Well, we changed our minds, didn't we? (all) Yeah! Let's get 'em! [thud] Inky, Pinky. Blinky, Clyde. Sue. Why, I.. I don't know what to say. [mumbles] How about thank you? (all) Th-th-thank you! Oh, don't thank us. Thank Santa Claus. [sleigh bells jingling] (Santa) 'Ho, ho, ho!' Merry Christmas to all and to all, a good chomp. [instrumental music] [theme music] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
