(yelling and grunting) (speaking foreign language) How does that feel, you ugly woman? (yelling and grunting) You all right? - All right. (light synth music) - I missed you. - Why are you so late? Did you not miss your child inside me? I'm much worried for you. You say you're coming back yesterday. - I'm sorry. - Shepard? Soldiers are coming. The border war is spreading north. - Come on. (dreamy synth music) This is our home. - If they find you, they find me and our child. It's not safe anymore. We must go to the United States. (ominous orchestral music) - We believe the man who sent the message was Steve Shepard, born August 14th, 1952. Reported to Vietnam, March, 1969. He was attached to a special forces unit, operating the A Shau Valley. Reassigned to train and organize the Montagnards. Ms. Kelley will you pass out the files, please? - [Ms. Kelley] Yes, sir. General Stafford. - Mmm. - This was a special operation along the Cambodian border. He was never heard from again. - [Stafford] Did he go AWOL? - We don't know, sir. He may have been on a mission. He may have been captured. All we do have is his message, two to be extracted. - Two prisoners of war? - Survivors at this point in time are not gonna make us look very good. - [Stafford] How do we know it's him? - The message was sent on outdated code system that to our knowledge was never broken. - What other proof do we have? - What other proof do we need? - Rumors of a white ghost have been circulating through various parts of Indochina. - White ghost? (laughing) - The natives believe that the spirit of an American solder lives in the jungle. - Oh, come on. - With confirmed sightings of what they believe to be a white ghost, it is their belief that this ghost roams through the jungle, collecting souls of American soldiers who never returned. What we believe is, Shepard could be the white ghost. - Well, if that's true, it means the man's spent almost half his life in the jungle. - It could be our best intelligence ever. We should do our best to bring him back. - What's his current position? - Here, sir. - What intelligence do we have? - Three battalions of Vietnamese regulars and a contingent of Cambodian mercenaries. - What about diplomatic channels? - Forget it. Vietnamese deny all knowledge of everything. - Oh, Christ, it's suicide. He's in the middle of a border war. - Well, we can't send in any troops. - I say we leave him, pretend we never got that message. - We can't do that. - Why not? - Oh, come on, listen. If this gets out-- (all yelling) - Well, what other options do we got? - Gentlemen, gentlemen. I think I have a solution to our problem. I suggest that we bring in an outside agency to bring Shepard back. - Wait a minute. Not another mercenary screw-up. That's all we need now. - We've used this man before. He knew Shepard in Nam. After 15 years in the jungle, we should someone that he knows. That's why Captain Walker and his special operatives are perfect for the job. - Where is Captain Walker now? - Central America. (upbeat Latin music) (speaking foreign language) (laughing) (speaking foreign language) (ominous atmospheric music) (muffled grunting) (guns firing) (screaming) (gun firing) (screaming) - Put it down. I won't hurt you. - No. - Put the gun down, damn it. - No, senor. - [Waco] Put the gun down. (speaking foreign language) - So, uh, kid, what's going on? - Shit, Captain. She won't put it down. (speaking foreign language) - No, no, no, senorita. No problemo, okay? Don't blow this. No, no. Now, watch out for that thing. Don't shoot him. He might deserve it, but I need him, okay? No problemo. Amigo, okay? Amigos. No, no, no, no. It's all right. All right, all right. That's right, that's right. God, you're a beautiful thing. No, no, no, no. (gun cocking) (gasping) - Don't! (gun firing) She was just a kid. - Get out of here, you dumb son of a bitch. (gun cocking) (gun firing) (upbeat Latin music) (bells ringing) (motor running) Move it. - We're going. - Fucking hell. Not one bleeding dentist in the entire shithole. - Shut up, Doc. (coughing) - Great way to get cancer. - Maybe that's why I got it. - No. (laughing) - Dumb shit. - Leave the kid alone. - Kid better grow up then, innit? - Hey, listen up, ladies. Let's settle down. - What's next, Captain? - A little unfinished business. - What kind of business? - What the fuck do you care? You're getting paid. - This time we ain't shootin' spics. - All right, where are we going? - Back to Nam. (intense orchestral music) (ominous atmospheric music) - It even smells the same. - You always say the same fucking thing. You ever think it's just you you smell? - Watch your mouth or you'll be collecting your own teeth. - Skinner. - Stop your bitchin'. - Pay attention, if you wanna make it out of here. - Gentlemen. We've got 36 hours to accomplish and hook up with the evac chopper. - What's the mission, Captain? - We're here to locate an American. He's a traitor. We bring him back, dead or alive. - What's it gonna be? - It's up to him. - So, how are we supposed to find this guy? - He thinks we're his ticket out of here. - We're 20 klicks north from the rendezvous. Let's pack up. - [AJ] Where is the pickup point? - Yeah, what if we get separated? - I wouldn't recommend it. (dreamy orchestral music) - That's all. (blowing) (laughing) - How do I look? - Mmm. (laughing) Beautiful. Shepard forget why he stay. It's good you tell your country about their sons. - I bring them sad news. - You bring them peace of mind. - This was supposed to be a round trip. I'm not getting left with me thumb up me bum, while he gets his ass shot off. - [Brownie] Give it a rest. (ominous atmospheric music) (door knocking) - Enter. - Major Cross. - Yeah, what is it, Jones? - It's about Walker and the special ops. We could have a situation here. - Damn it, Jones. How did this slip through the cracks? - Sir, I'm sorry, but the computer wouldn't allow us access to the entire Shepard file. - Well, shit, man. They're gonna make contact in two hours. Lieutenant, you didn't see this. Phone to field. Security clearance 15. Codename, White Ghost. (dreamy synth music) (eerie atmospheric music) (low thudding) (ominous atmospheric music) - Snake, 12 o'clock. (suspenseful atmospheric music rising) (grunting) - Put him inside. (ominous atmospheric music) (speaking foreign language) - Come on, man. Let's get out of here. - I ain't satisfied with the score yet. (speaking foreign language) (ominous atmospheric music rising) (yelling) (gun firing) (speaking foreign language) (guns firing) (yelling) (grunting) - Wait here. If something happens, you go home. - What we have here, gentlemen, is a real clusterfuck. - Captain, I tr-- - Shut up and hide the gooks. You two assholes have jeopardized this entire mission. If it happens again, I'll personally bust a cap on your ass. You got it? (coughing) - I'm gonna be watching you shitheads. (speaking foreign language over radio) (gun firing) - Telephone, Captain. (ominous atmospheric music) - White Ghost Team to White Ghost Leader, go. I can't hear you, White Ghost. You're breaking up. Come back. Can't hear you. You're breaking up. Lose this hunk of shit. Let's go. - White Ghost, come back. Come back, White Ghost. Shit! Get me a plane. I'm going to Thailand. - Yes, sir. - Fall out. I'll be back. - [Brownie] Skinner. - What's wrong with the captain? - Just do your job. - Brownie, you are one pleasant fellow. (yelling) (guns cocking) - You guys my way out of here? (ominous atmospheric music) You my ticket out? - Hey, asshole. Wanna be my friend? - Walker? - You son of a bitch. (low thudding) (guns firing) (gunfire echoing) (yelling) - Hey, cut him down. - [AJ] Cut me down! Cut me down! (moaning) (gun firing) (eerie atmospheric music) (distant guns firing) (speaking foreign language) - Thi! Thi! (intense orchestral music) (grunting) (suspenseful orchestral music) (speaking foreign language) - [Walker] Move it! Come on. - Maybe they'll take care of him for us. - Let's move. - Thi! Thi! (speaking foreign language) (bomb exploding) (screaming) (bombs exploding) (snake hissing) - This guy ain't fucking human. - Eh. No one could live through this. (laughing) - Fire in the hole! (bomb exploding) Waco, Skinner, in the hole. Brownie, find the other end of this tunnel. I want that son of a bitch. - Down river, let's do it. (gun firing) - Jesus, what the hell was that? - Just a snake, kid. - Quit calling me kid. - Sure thing, kid. (speaking foreign language) (ominous atmospheric music) - They've got somebody tied up down there. - Mercenaries. They're Vietnamese regulars. (speaking foreign language) - It's a woman. - At least somebody's getting lucky. (speaking foreign language) (laughing) (laughing) (speaking foreign language) (gasping) (choking) (bird calling) (muffled screaming) - I got no fight with you. Walker's crazy, you know? (eerie atmospheric music) (gasping) (screaming) - Shepard. Shepard. (crying) (laughing) (screaming) (bomb exploding) (guns firing) (yelling foreign language) (yelling) (gun firing) (low growling) (yelling) (grunting) (heavy kicking and punching) (groaning) (moaning) (moaning) (screaming) (screaming) - It took this place 15 years, but it finally got me good. (screaming) - Shut up. (bird calling) - Where's the kid? - I thought he was my backup. - I never saw Shepard, man. What? I never saw him. - We better shag our asses out of here. Place is gonna be crawling with gooks. - Yeah. - We got less than 18 hours to wrap this up. What about Skinner? - You're not gonna leave me. Hey, man. I never told anybody. 15 years. That oughta be worth something. - Look, you'll be dead before dawn. Let's take a few of 'em with you. - What? Are you fucking nuts? You owe me. - Listen, either you do it yourself or I will. You got it? Saddle up! - You can't just leave him here, man. - You wanna stay with him? (groaning) (laughing) - Let's go, kid. - You owe me! You owe me! (groaning) (eerie atmospheric music) (grunting) (spitting) Eat this, mother-- (bomb exploding) (screaming) - Keep moving. (bird calling) - Major Cross, you're wanted on the phone. (ominous synth music) - No, sir. There's no problem here. I just wanted to get a head start on the briefing of Shepard. Yes, sir. There's absolutely no problem here, sir. Everything is under control. (grunting) (speaking foreign language) (grunting) (speaking foreign language) (grunting) (ominous atmospheric music) (speaking foreign language) (grunting) (speaking foreign language) (gasping) (speaking foreign language) - There are Americans in Vietnam and you are with them. I want to know why. (heavy slapping) (grunting) Answer me. Soon, you'll beg to tell me. (speaking foreign language) (crying) No. (speaking foreign language) (screaming) (grenade pin clicking) (grenade pin clicking) (grenade pin clicking) - Oh, shit. - This is battalion strength. What the hell are we doing? - Shepard's at three o'clock. AJ, Doc, stake out the south perimeter. - Maguire, take this. (gun cocking) - Waco, Maguire, stake out the other side. (crying) - They tell me the white ghost is among us. Tell me who he is and why he is here. America is our enemy. You're now our enemy. I know the American soldiers all too well. We fought them and won. I will deal with the white ghost. (crying) (mine exploding) (speaking foreign language) (screaming) (gun firing) (grunting) (choking) (speaking foreign language) (grunting) (coughing) (speaking foreign language) (coughing) (speaking foreign language) (crying) - Your white ghost. So, I see the ghost is the real man who bleeds. (coughing) (speaking foreign language) (crying) (speaking foreign language) Talk to me. - Fuck you, you fish-head. (spitting) - I see you white devils still have no respect for our country. (screaming) Why have you come back? (crying) Bring the woman. (crying) The pain from such a small object, placed under the fingernail is more than most men can stand. But a woman... Talk to me and you'll be free to go. - I don't know this man. - Why protect a coward like this? As you wish. (screaming) - Jeez, how far are they going with it? - Till they get where they're going. (screaming) - He's walking right into them. What the hell's he doing? - He's got balls, man. That's for sure. - Balls for brains. - You should speak now. If you're dead it doesn't make any difference. Why you are here? - Fuck off, you fucking faggot. (crying) (gun firing) (screaming) (speaking foreign language) - Oh, Jesus. (gun firing) - Throw him away. - We should've helped him. - God, this isn't real, man. - Concentrate on your objective or you could be next. We want Shepard, not the gooks. (ominous synth music) (grunting) (heavy kicking and punching) (gun firing) (speaking foreign language) - Take him alive. (speaking foreign language) White ghost. Who are you? How long have you been here? - Pull the plug. - [Commander] What is your mission? - Come on, shoot the bastard. You got a problem with that? - No. - Good, do it. - [Commander] When did you get here? Are you a spy to continue the war? Where is your team? Answer me. How many men are here? - Take the shot, kid. Take the shot. - Do it, kid. - [Commander] Who are you? Answer me. (screaming) (grunting) (gun firing) (speaking foreign language) - You dumb son of a bitch. - Leave him alone. It's over. (grunting) - You're a dead man. You're a dead man! Give me that thing. Give it to me. Shepard! (gun firing) (guns firing) (grunting) (speaking foreign language) (bomb exploding) (speaking foreign language) (gun firing) (bomb exploding) (speaking foreign language) (guns firing) - Thi Hau! (gun firing) (bomb exploding) (grunting) (guns firing) (bomb exploding) (guns firing) (heavy breathing) - He'll be back. - Come on, let's get outta here. (speaking foreign language) (bamboo slamming) (grunting) (bamboo cracking) (speaking foreign language) (choking) (grunting) (guns firing) (grunting) (yelling) (gun firing) Let's go. (ominous synth music) - Stay with the car. Major Cross, I'm John Ehrlich, State Department. Now, hang on, Major. You've been asking around for a chopper run. What is it? What's going on? - Got something to attend to. - [John] And what exactly is that, Major? Since you've arrived in Bangkok, I've been inundated-- - [Cross] I told you. I got a job to do and I'm gonna do it. - Right. And I'm telling you, I can't let you jeopardize what is already a delicate political situation. (jet flying over) Major, there are no Americans alive in Vietnam. Have you got that? - No, sir. - Damn it, it's over now. It's old news. Nobody believes that shit anymore. - I still do. - Christ, Major, look at them. They're running tours of the damn place. - There's a soldier over there who needs my help. Take a good look at my face. Do I look like a crackpot? Am I making this up? - You got anybody, anybody at all, can verify your mission? - No, damn it, and I told you why. Now, what the hell's it gonna be? - I hope you're right, Major. 'Cause right now I'm breaking all the rules. You got it. Major, (ominous synth music) I hope you find him. - I will. - Okay, you take the right flank. We'll leap frog till we pick him up. - We got four hours to extraction. - Yeah, yeah. - And with or without Shepard. We are outta here. (ominous atmospheric music) (eerie atmospheric music) - [Steve] You're in over your head out here, Walker. I figured you to be robbing graves by now, but I guess there's always room in the government for guys like you. (eerie atmospheric music) - When the going got tough, you folded. Assholes like you lost it for us, Shepard. - [Steve] So, the State Department wants me eliminated, huh? - Not so. I just got lucky. I find it extremely appropriate you ain't ever gonna leave this place. (ominous atmospheric music rising) (grunting) (heavy punching) This is fucking perfect. You're gonna be maggot-meat, traitor. (heavy punching) (grunting) - You killed women and children. - [Walker] It happens. - You liked it. - For the breeders and the snipers of tomorrow, had to be done. (heavy punching) (grunting) - You didn't get past the propaganda, Walker. (heavy punching) (grunting) (mine clicking) (ominous atmospheric music) - [Brownie] Let's get outta here. Do him. - Nah, we'll let the landmine do it. (spitting) (speaking foreign language) - Don't move. You're in a minefield. - Oh, Jesus. - What are you doing here? - Hell if I know, man. I think I'm on the wrong side. Oh, shit. - Just relax. Take a couple deep breaths. We're gonna help each other out of here. Let me think. You got a boot knife there. Throw it over here, easy. - What are you doing? Is that gonna work? - Probably not. - Believe me, man, Bakersfield's beginning to look pretty good right now. - This is one of ours. Don't move, don't move. Shuck. All right. Let's give this a shot. Ready to move. Now. (mines exploding) (yelling) Let's go. Come on. (yelling) (groaning) - Shit! - I can't reach it. (gun firing) - Gotta get Thi Hau. - Where are we going? - Need help. What's your time schedule? - Extraction's in one hour. - Trust me. - Jeez, look at the stash. Hey, I want you to know that I didn't know anything about this mission, man. Walker never told us. (gun cocking) Why does he want your ass so bad? - He was my commanding officer. We hit a village one day, (gun cocking) killed a lot of women and children. - What, on purpose? - I filed charges, tried to get him court marshaled. (gun cocking) Army didn't wanna know about it. It was just after My Lai. They didn't want the bad press. (laughing) Politics. - So, what happened? - Nothing. Just asked him to leave quietly. (gun cocking) Let's go. (ominous synth music) (speaking foreign language) (gasping) - [Commander] If he does come this far, you both will be blown to bits with the push of a button. - [Waco] Why do you stay here, man? - [Steve] My life is here now. - Don't you have any family or friends back home? - My brother was MIA. My mother died of grief. - Sorry, man. There any more guys like you around here? - I'm it. Give me 45 seconds. Cover my six. - I'll try. (gun cocking) (gun firing) (grunting) (grunting) (guns firing) (grunting) (grenade exploding) (yelling) (speaking foreign language) (guns firing) (screaming) (grenades exploding) (grenade exploding) (screaming) (gun firing) (grenade exploding) (grenade exploding) (guns firing) (screaming) (speaking foreign language) (grenade exploding) (screaming) (gun firing) (grunting) (guns firing) (yelling) (grunting) (ominous synth music) - Shepard, don't. (heavy kicking and punching) (grunting) (screaming) (crying) - How's that feel, you ugly woman? - What took you so long? - Go wait in the jeep. (gun firing) Run! (gun firing) (guns firing) (grenade exploding) (speaking foreign language) (gun firing) (guns firing) Go on, get outta here. (guns firing) (screaming) - [Waco] Take over. (screaming) (guns firing) Hang on, we're getting out of here. - No, don't. Wait. - He's coming. (low thudding) - Shit. (bomb exploding) (gun firing) (grunting) (guns firing) (screaming) (grenade exploding) (grunting) (grenade exploding) (screaming) (missile exploding) (yelling) (jeep crashing) - Get out. Thi. Thi, are you all right? Son of a... Mother fucker! - Go on, get out of here. I'll catch up. Go! - Come on, come on. (speaking foreign language) (guns firing) (yelling) (screaming) (gun firing) (grunting) (gasping) (gasping) Come on. (intense synth music) (gun firing) (screaming) (grunting) - Get this fucker in the air. The gooks are right on my ass. - Where's Shepard and the rest of 'em? - They got whacked. Knee-deep in locals 10 minutes after we hooked up. - None of them left? - Look, you're gonna crank up his coffin? Come on, let's get out of here. (intense synth music) - There they are. (guns firing) (yelling) (grunting) (heavy punching) (screaming) (guns firing) (screaming) - Come on, move, move. Come on, come on! (screaming) I got 'em. Where you going? - I'm coming. (guns firing) (grunting) (muffled screaming) (grunting) (heavy punching) (screaming) (screaming) (screaming) (grunting) (gun firing) - Come on, leave him. Leave him. (screaming) - Shepard! (gun firing) (crying) (moaning) You son of a bitch! Damn you! (guns firing) (grunting) (dramatic synth music) - Welcome back.
