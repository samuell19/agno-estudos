Yeah, it's a nightmare down there. Just in time for Thanksgiving weekend, unfortunately. Rerouting. If you're traveling around that area, your best bet is to stay as far away from the highway as possible. We will keep you informed throughout the day only on 1270 WLUN, Kentucky. Okay, would you rather have a room full of pennies or a stack of pennies as high as the Empire State Building? Uh, I think I'd take the big stack. I'd be rich. Weak. Rerouting to Washington, DC. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (COWS MOOING) In 30 miles, turn right. (SNIFFLES) (INTENSE MUSIC) In 500 feet make a right turn. (MUSIC CONTINUES) Make a right turn. It's not even a road. Guess we're taking the next right. (MUSIC CONTINUES) Make a U-turn, if possible. Give me better directions, if possible. Make a U-turn, if possible. Turn left. Think they seen us? Okay. This doesn't make any sense. Just reroute me. (EXHALES SHARPLY) Yes! Suck it, phone! (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) (VEHICLE APPROACHING) You need some help there, miss? Oh, no. I'm fine. I'm just stretching my legs. Yeah. And your map. Right. I'm just getting my bearings. Yeah, we seen you up there and thought maybe you was having some sort of trouble. Oh, no. I'm... I'm just passing through. You sure you're okay? You look a little upset. And these woods, they can be a crazy place especially if you ain't familiar. I guess I'm a little frustrated, you know. These maps aren't super useful. (CHUCKLES) Ain't that the truth. (LAUGHS) So... so that's it then? You're just a tourist passing through here? Yeah? Well shit, if it's directions you're looking for, me and Buck.. That's my brother Buck there. We lived here our whole lives. So we can get you most anywhere. Uh, well, um, do you know the best way back to 64? I-64? (LAUGHS) That's quite a ways. You're lucky you ran into us. Yeah. 'Cause there ain't but a couple roads run through these hills and well, you know, you got yourself turned around nowhere. Alright. See here? Right here. You just keep on this way and you'll make yourself back to the highway, okay. But you'll be backtracking quite a bit. Well, guess I'm taking the scenic route. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. I guess you are. (SNIFFLES) Alright. Oh, hey, hey! Almost forgot. Your map. Oh, thanks. Say, you won't make it anywhere before sundown and we live just up a ways. So how about you come on over for some dinner? - Holli, shouldn't we just... - Oh, he ain't going anywhere. What do you say? Thanks, but I really should be getting going, so... No.. That... that... that might not be the best idea. I mean, you got lost driving around here and that was in broad daylight. And you don't wanna be out here after dark, trust me. Listen, no offense, but you are starting to make me feel very uncomfortable right now. Is that a fact? Well, listen, we just want you to, uh... uh, be comfortable. That's all we want. And it's gonna get real cold out here real quick. So why don't you just come on back up to our place? We'll have a drink or two maybe, you know, smoke a little somethin'? It'd be like a little party. Yeah? Come on, let's all.. (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GROANS) Goddamn! Bitch cut me! Yah! - Now hold on a second, honey. - Fuck off! Get that knife away from her! (GROANS) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) (INTENSE MUSIC) (PANTING) She's gettin' away. (PANTING) (PANTING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (PANTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) That way. That way. - You sure? - Yeah. Come on. (PANTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Okay. I can figure this out. Yeah. (SNIFFLES) Definitely. (BIRD SCREECHING) (GRUNTS) (WATER SPLASHING) Shit! (PANTING) (INTENSE MUSIC) It's going to be fine. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Everything's going to be fine. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SNIFFLES) (TELEPHONE RINGING) Fording County Sheriff's Office, Deputy Katz speaking. Hold on. Sheriff, line one. This is O'Doyle. Hey, sheriff this is Penny from the Charleston office. I have a stranded vehicle report for that two-five-oh county road. If we could get your registration report as soon as possible, our office is gonna be closed due to the holiday. Penny, could you, uh, could you hold on a minute, honey? Mm-hm. What she want? Uh, just an abandoned car. Uh, it got me thinking. That, uh, hanging fella, the Hispanic. - What's his name? - That's Edwin Garro. Yeah, yeah, that Garro fella. We should see if he had any vehicles registered in his name. Check them against abandon vehicle reports. You think this might be his car? No, no, timeline's all wrong but maybe something got picked up last week. Uh, it's a long shot, but, you know, due diligence and all. I'm on it. Hello, Penny. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Uh, so you say it's up on 250, huh? (SIGHS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (EXHALES SHARPLY) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (GRUNTS) Hey! (BREATHING HEAVILY) (PANTING) Okay. (CRACKING) (GROANS) Hey! Over here! Help! Ah. (GRUNTS) Ow. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (BOTTLES CLINKING) (KNOCKING) (SIGHS) Phew! (CHUCKLES) Well, dangit! You're just as quiet as a cottonmouth when you wanna be, huh? You here on official business, sheriff or this is just a social call? I ain't here to take a bunch of lip, you can count on that. I got a call about an abandoned vehicle at the bend, down by Rust Creek. Well, as you can see, we prefer to abandon our vehicles right here at home. Well, I just seen you and Buck tramplin' up from that creek every damn day, so, uh when I get a call from the state police... State? What do the staties gotta do with it? Nothing, yet. If we seen something I'd tell you but the plain fact is we weren't up there. Now you can come out here puffing up your chest all you want, but it don't change the facts. Boy, you must think I'm some kinda a prize dummy, huh? Well I got news for you.. (BOTTLES CLATTERING) Easy, sheriff! Jesus! You a bit, you a bit jumpy, Quickdraw. You hurt there? Huntin' accident. Oh, you're bleeding right there. You should get that stitched up. It's just a scratch. Did you get that scratch up by Rust Creek? Like I said.. ...we ain't been up there in days. Alright, well.. I tried. I tried. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (ENGINE REVVING) (GROANS) (EXHALES) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Ah.

(LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (LAUGHING) Ho-ly shit. Will you look at this? We bull's-eyed a goddamn oak tree! (GRUNTS) They ain't never gonna send nobody this far off road. Ah, shit. Now all we gotta do is find that bitch. She was cut pretty deep, Holli. She ain't gonna last out here too long. (PANTING) Can't we just go back... Not until they find a body we're gonna have O'Doyle and the staties up our asses, Buck. But if they find her, won't they be all over the place anyway? No, not all over. Just around where they find the body. Get it? Good. Come on, we'll start at the creek work our way back down the road. - Fuck. - Move your fat ass. This way. Let's go. Come on, now watch your steps there, Buck. (INTENSE MUSIC) (GROANS) (EXHALES SHARPLY) (SIGHS) (SNIFFLES) (MUSIC CONTINUES) Oh, my God! Oh. (GROANS) Come on. (SOBS) Ain't even dry.

You were supposed to drink that. Stay the hell away from me. Put that down. Put that down. Take another step and I'll throw this in your fucking face. - Careful now. That's my.. - I'm serious, motherfucker! I'll burn your fucking face off! (GROANS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) What the fuck.. (INTENSE MUSIC) - Hey! What was all that about? - Hey. Oh, just sheriff stuff. Did you ask them about that SUV? Um, I didn't know you were taking on "The Big SUV Case." I... I'm just curious. You know, d... did they have an alibi? Alibi for... for what? For whatever was going on with that SUV. Nick, do you, do you have such an abundance of free time that you need to invent crimes to investigate just to stave off the boredom? No, sir, I just... Because if you do, I would love someone to tackle "The Case of the Moving Violations Paperwork That's Backed Up to Early October." Point taken, sheriff. (EXHALES) But that SUV thing, I mean, doesn't that seem odd to you? A vehicle like that, abandoned, in the middle of the day no driver in sight? Are you second guessing me, son? No, sir. But.. (SIGHS) Speak plain. You do have a way of treating the locals with a certain deference. Nick... you're a good deputy. You're a good man. I appreciate your commitment. So I'm just gonna say this one time and I think it oughta be enough. Chief. Indian. Mind your place. And, uh, as far as them Pritcherts are concerned I've been arrestin' them boys since they were in grade school. And they are trouble, that's for sure but they ain't got the brains between the two of 'em to be dangerous. And moreover, that mysterious SUV moved along some time yesterday. - Oh. - Yeah. (CHUCKLING) Oh. Yeah. Likely just run out of gas then? Likely. Oh. Okay. Say, sheriff, do you have any objection to me calling the registered owner? You know, just to put this whole thing to bed? Uh, if it'll give you some peace of mind, son go right on ahead. Right. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Eat this. (SNIFFLES) (CLATTERING) (GRUNTS) Uh-uh. Knock it off. You lost blood. You need to eat. I need a hospital and the police. Eat. Suit yourself. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) What's your name? I'm Sawyer. - Sawyer Scott. - Shut up and eat. I go to Centre College. I'm a senior. I was on my way to DC for a this big job interview and my stupid GPS got me lost. These two guys jumped me. I'm sure my friends are worried about me. And my parents.. Quiet. ...and if you could just untie me and take me to the police, you'd be a hero. Shh. I wouldn't even mention the.. This. Might even be a reward. Somebody help me! Somebody help me! If they find you here they'll kill you. Keep quiet, or I can't help you. (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) There he is. Serious as ever. Hello, cuz. Hollister. Buck. What happened here? Aw, just some horseplay. You know. Sorry we ain't been up to visit more. Things just been kinda crazy lately. - Okay. - No, no, it ain't. We're family. No excuse. You know. - So, how'd the last batch go? - No problems. And the yield was what we thought it would be? More or less. So we should be on target for S... Saturday? Uh-huh. I get low on sudo and some other stuff. We're all set with that. We'll be back up tomorrow with more sudo, ammonia, matches, whatever. I'm good on ammonia but I'm gonna need more lye. You burned through that shit pretty fast, didn't you? Well, hell. What Lowell wants, Lowell gets. Ask him about the girl, Holli. Oh, yeah, about that. Seems some girl went missing up here a couple days ago and Sheriff O'Doyle he nearly crawled up our ass about it. I don't suppose you seen anything? I ain't seen no girl. Okay. Do you mind if we take a look around? - Free country. - Yeah. It is at that. (GRUNTING) Nothin'. What's eatin' you? Tell me, cousin how many times me and Buck been up here since we got this trailer set up? Dozen or so. And every time we do, uh, I mean hell, even Buck could tell you. What's the first thing that we do? Go in and have a beer. Right. Right. But today when we come up here and you step outside to meet us and stand there the whole time in the middle of the fucking rain like you're some kinda goddamn guard dog. You got something to say? I think I'm saying it. We tracked that girl up here yesterday. Trail went cold not a hundred yards away. You found yourself some fun, didn't you? Didn't you, huh? (LAUGHING) I had a accident with the lye is all. Place is full of fumes. Lowell.. ...it hurts my feelings when you treat me like I'm some kind of goddamn idiot. Now, how about we go on inside and have a look. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SNIFFLES) She ain't in there. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLING) Oh.. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (MUSIC CONTINUES) You shouldn't be here. (GRUNTS) You're hurting me. Better me than them. Next time I tell you to stay put you stay put! (MUSIC CONTINUES) (BIRDS CHIRPING) - Suicide? - Yeah. So you think it's just coincidence that this Hispanic fella from out of town offed himself right when we got Mexican drugs flooding the state? I... I couldn't say. But in Fording County suicide seems to make a lot more sense than some cartel gang thing. Maybe. That doesn't sound right to me. So, we gonna wait on the coroner. Now also, Penny from Dispatch wanted me to follow up on an abandoned vehicle. Oh! That wasn't nothin'. Moved on the same day. Oh, well, uh.. Well, you got something to add, deputy? Uh.. Go on, Katz. That vehicle was registered to a couple over in Paducah but they gave it to their daughter. Now, she's over... Why don't you just get to the part where you tell us the bad news. The driver's name is, uh, Sawyer Scott and apparently nobody seems to know where she is at. She's missing? Well, her roommates said that she was going home for Thanksgiving, but her folks said that she was staying on campus. When was the last time she was seen? Monday morning. Monday morning? I... I just got off the phone with the mother and she said that the girl's not answering her phone. Look, that was before you send out your storm troopers start trampling out people's flower beds and kicking down their doors. Let's just make sure she's not passed out in Virginia Beach somewhere. Jesus Christ, O'Doyle you think I enjoy doing your job for you? I'm not about to send my men traipsing through the woods on Thanksgiving if I don't have to. But you better get a line on this girl soon or you gonna have state police choppers blocking out the sun down here. - Deputy. - Sir. - Sorry, sheriff... - Save it. We got a picture of this missing girl? Pretty clever how you burned through them ropes. - What is that stuff? - Lye. - Is that some kind of acid? - Base. Burns like acid. Bases burn too. And the milk, that neutralized it? Milk ain't acid enough to neutralize lye. You'd need something like.. ...like vinegar to neutralize lye. So why don't you have some vinegar handy? You know what happens when you mix an acid with a base? Neutralizes it? Yeah, with so much heat it burn you worse than the lye did. Thought you were a college girl. I'm not a chemistry major. (SNIFFLES) Well, that's why milk's better. Less reaction. Still burned quite a bit, thank you. Why do you know so much about this stuff? I've been cooking meth since I was 14 years old. You learn real quick what all can burn you. You know.. ...if you let me go I won't tell them anything. You say you're trying to help me, but you're holding me here. Can't do it. I promise I won't tell anyone anything. If you just let me go. We're five miles from the nearest road. Twenty from any kind of town. I got no car. You wouldn't make it a 100 yards the shape you're in. And even if you did, the first person you met would like as not hand you right over to Hollister. Bullshit. - You just wanna keep me here. - Quit it. You can't keep me here forever! I said quit it. You wanna try your luck out in them woods, go on. Hollister and Buck are going into Charleston this weekend. They'll leave their truck at their mama's house. I'll go down on Saturday and I'll borrow it. And then I'll take you someplace safe. Out of Fording County. I might need some help with this one, heavy as a mother.. (GRUNTS) Jesus Christ! O'Doyle? I got some plain questions for you and I want some plain answers. - Is this about that car? - Hell with the car. Now, I got the state police asking about a missing girl! We did what you told us, sheriff. Son, if you'd done what I told you they would've found that girl's body somewhere down in Jonesboro County by now. I still don't know what the hell you dimwits were thinking. I told you, okay, she come up on us when we was burying that bag of shit. And we thought she seen somethin'! Well, she seen something now. At this point, don't it figure she already out there in them woods froze to death? It don't matter if she's out there dead in a gully or singin' on Bandstand. Without a body, these woods is gonna be crawling with state police. Well, she ain't been found, okay? So, she's likely dead. The birds will be at her by now. She'll be easier to spot. (SIGHS) We'll go out again tomorrow after we run this stuff up to Lowell. How's your cousin doing? Weird. Like, I don't even know him. What I meant was, are we still on schedule? Hell, you know that ol' boy don't do nothin' but cook. Big batch here, but we'll be right by Saturday. We'd better be. Breakfast is peaches or bologna. What are you doing? Cuttin' matchbooks. - What for? - Cook meth. I thought meth was made from, like.. ...ephedrine and Drano. And matchbooks. Why are you making meth? Isn't everyone doing heroin now? - I read. - Can't cook heroin. How many of them do you need? Lots. And what do you do when you have them all cut up? - Mix that shit in. - What's that shit? Why do you ask so many damn questions? Never mind. Just thought I might learn something. So.. ...you don't really know what you're doing. You're like one of those European pop bands that sing in English but don't actually know what any of the lyrics mean. You sure ride high for a girl who jammed her wet hands in a bucketful of lye yesterday. I wasn't being condescending. I'm just saying. You know, it's amazing they got you doing all this complex chemistry and you don't even have to understand it. That ain't condescending? So... I've been thinking about your plan to borrow your truck. I just don't know I should stay up here for that long. I mean, it's okay for a backup plan but, you know, if you can get me to a phone, then... Bad idea. If I'm here when those guys come back... It's safer to keep you here than to try and move you. I'm not really a sit and wait type. You don't say. Listen, I just think I can come up with a more proactive way to... Hey, would you hand me that pitcher right there? - Why is it so cold? - Just pour it in here. Real slow. It's cold 'cause the acetone inside, it's evaporating.. ...sucking away the energy from what all it's touchin'. Mix that with the matchbooks, separate the red phosphorous. Then I'm gonna mix that with iodine to get hydroiodic acid, which I need to cook meth. So you do all that for just one ingredient? That's the job. Like a bunch of little science projects? Combine this ingredient, separate that one. Yeah, and just about every one of them will kill you. Every one of 'em is either corrosive flammable, both. Methanol, acetone, glycol, butane.. You thought that lye was tough. We used to cook with this. Anhydrous ammonia. In here it's just a liquid that'll burn your skin right off. Room temp, it turns into poison gas. One spark.. Hollister will be here soon. - Oh, God. - Lowell. Low-ell. Low-ell. Low-ell. (GRUNTS) L-O-L. (LAUGHING) L-O-L. Get it? (GRUNTS) Hey, L-O-L! Where you at? - Hey. - Just put that down there. - Eh, what's cooking, Lowell? - Try not to breathe. - Shouldn't we get masks? - But I just got the one. - Best unload quick. - Jesus Christ. Thought you were gonna wait around back of the trailer. What if Hollister had come down here? Or Buck? What if they'd come behind the trailer? Well, I could have kept 'em from there. You gotta learn to sit still. So, that road I came from is, is that way? And that little town is that way? Yeah, that's Boone. But the nearest road is Bishop that way, to the east. You fixing to make a break for it? Your call. But if you're just restless, I can put you to work. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) I know, I know. I'm sorry. I know what I said but.. Baby, this girl is still out there and her mama's been callin', just worried sick. We'll have plenty of other Thanksgivings but this girl won't if we don't find her soon. - Nick! - Y... yes, sheriff? What are you still doing here? It's almost dinnertime. Well, I... I was just.. It's okay, I'm just.. No, no, the hell it is! It's your first Thanksgiving together. You go home have dinner with your wife. - But if I don't finish... - That's an order, deputy. I think I can muddle through without you for an hour or two. Bring me back a plate. - Go! Go, go go! - Okay. Okay. Thank you, sheriff. Uh, babe, sheriff's sending me home for dinner. Just, uh, give me, give me 20. You gotta speak up a bit. Yeah, I'm getting in my cruiser right now. Whipped cream? No, baby, no stores are gonna be open around here on Thanksgiving. Well, who says you need whipped cream with pumpkin pie? No, I ain't driving all the.. Oh, wait. Hang on, babe. I think I got some cream in the office. I said I think I got some c.. Jenna, my phone's about to die. I'll be home soon. I love you too. ..tired of excuses, Hollister. You come up with that fucking girl's body, alright, or so he.. Listen, this is my goddamn retirement and if you screw it up, believe me, you will not live long enough to regret it. (INTENSE MUSIC) (O'DOYLE SIGHS) Hey, Nick. (O'DOYLE CHUCKLES) Uh, look, I... I can understand.. Just, you know, hearing maybe half of that conversation it could be misconstrued. Right. Come on, really? Nick, look.. (CHUCKLES) Well, let's just sit down and talk about this. I can hear you just fine from over here, sheriff. You're not even gonna give me a chance to explain? I mean, I.. Easy now. You'll have your chance to explain. But right now I'm walking out of here and you're not stoppin' me. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) It don't have to be like this, Nick. I'm sorry, sheriff. But whatever you're into you're gonna have to answer for it. (KEYS JINGLE) (GUNSHOTS) (INTENSE MUSIC) (MIXER WHIRRING) Would you rather have a room full of pennies or a stack of pennies as tall as the Empire State Building? Never mind. (WHIRRING) - I'd rather have the stack. - What? I'd rather have the stack of pennies. Real tall. A stack isn't many. The Empire State Building's like a 100 stories high. More than that can fit in a closet. If I had a stack of pennies tall as that it'd be the most incredible thing you ever saw. Right here, in the middle of the Blue Ridge pennies to the sky.. People'd come from miles. (CHUCKLES) Hey, what day is it? Thursday. Thanksgiving. I guess you'd be with your folks, huh? Actually, I was ditchin' them this year for a stupid job interview. I know. And the worst part is I didn't even tell them why. I was too embarrassed in case I didn't get the job. All that scrambling around.. ...all my plans. What does is matter now? My wife used to say "Man plans, God laughs." (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Sounds like something my mom would say. Always talking about God's plan. Sure don't seem like much of one. Sure don't. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (GRUNTS) Bury him deep. Don't just run him out past that Sycamore Line and kick some dirt on him. You got it? - What about the girl? - You still got her wallet? Mm-hm. Alright, I got an idea how to keep the staties off our ass, for the weekend at least. But we still gotta find her. Do not talk like that, okay? Don't worry about it. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this, okay? I'm sure that, uh, Nick is fine. I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation.. Hold on, I... I just, I'm in the middle of something, alright? Uh, Jenna, uh.. I'm gonna go right now and take care of this. I will call you soon as I know somethin'. I promise. Okay. Bye. (SIGHS) Jesus Christ I do not have time for your foolishness this morning, Douglas. My deputy is MIA. His wife's been calling me non-stop all night. Between her and Sawyer Scott's mother I... I cannot go five minutes without an hysterical phone call. - He been gone long? - He, uh.. He left here yesterday afternoon nobody's seen him since. I mean, I... I'm concerned. Well, good news is I'm here to lighten your workload. I'm taking over on that missing girl. Now, my team's heading up here now to do a proper search of those woods up by Rust Creek all the way through to Blackridge. Okay, well, it's no secret I don't like that but, uh, I guess it's for the best. Mm-hm. Got my own missing person to deal with now. Okay, well, uh, you just give me a minute I'll head out with you, I'll debrief your men, and I'll catch 'em up on what we know. Look, that ain't gonna be necessary. They got the report. I got this girl's parents comin' over from Paducah. I... it's fine, it'll just be a minute. Just gonna check Nick's locker here. See if he took his civvies with him or if he's still in uniform. Really, O'Doyle, we can handle it, alright? I appreciate the offer. Oh, what the hell.. Oh, man. Well, I'll be goddamned. (EXHALES) Though we have not yet determined the nature of the relationship we do believe that Deputy Katz is involved in Scott's disappearance. His cruiser was found this morning in Jonesboro County so it's a good bet he's fleeing the state. So, we're going to extend our search west until we find this man. (SIGHS) Now what? (EXHALES) That's it. In 20 minutes, you'll be an official cook. - That ain't so hard. - Ah! You think you can sit still 20 minutes? I don't know. Well, I think I might be starting to get used to the quiet country life. Inside. Stay by the back door. And if there's trouble... run. (SIGHS) Hey there, son. - How's the cook? - Fine. Hm. Well, I just thought I'd come up here to check on ya. And you done it. That's close enough. (LAUGHS) Wh.. What, you're giving orders now, is that it? I just don't like nobody disturbing my cook's all. Huh. Well, let me tell you somethin'. I got a lot invested in this here. And, uh, if I wanna go inside and take a look what y'all up to, I'm gonna do that. You ain't. You forget who you're talking to? I'm the chief, you're the Indian. My kitchen.. ...my rules. You know, you ain't the only cook around here. So, why don't you just set that gun down and make nice? (GUN COCKS) Don't kid yourself, boy. I could put two in you before you could even get them barrels up above your waist. Lucky for me you're standing next to a drum full of ether. Too dangerous to keep inside. One spark from, say, some buckshot hitting the metal.. Hm. (CHUCKLES) Wow. A Pritchert with some brains. Lord help us all. Alright, well.. You just mind you get this cook done right. Next time I come up here.. ...I'll know where I stand. (EXHALES) Was that your boss? He sounds like an asshole. He's the worst kind of snake there is. Don't rattle before he bite. - Doesn't look like much. - It'll do. How much more do we need? Nine, ten more cooks. That's gonna take all day. Best get to it then. But if you get asked, just remember.. Escorting a prisoner for interview. I got it. Suspect. Escorting a suspect for interview. Don't forget to shave. And keep him in the back seat. How come I gotta sit in back? On account of when'd you ever see someone that wasn't police riding in the front of a police car? You ain't police. That's why he's got the uniform. Dangit! Now just remember, don't give them anything until you get the money. - I won't. - You.. You count out all that money, alright? Don't get lazy and let 'em short you. Why don't you just come do the thing yourself if you're so damn nervous then, huh? 'Cause that's what I got you for. So don't screw it up. Alright? We got one chance to show these boys we can compete with them Mexicans. Lowell cooks glass twice as good as any Mexican. Yeah, well that's the only reason he ain't in the ground. You know, he pulled a shotgun on me today? It's still burnin' me up. Yeah, he's been real touchy lately. Don't even invite us in for a drink no more. (SCOFFS) Alright, well, let's do this. Alright. I'mma go inside and change. I'mma go sit in the back. Not very green. Well, if you dump it on the land, it stains the ground red. Like having a big meth lab sign in your front yard. The creek washes it clear away. By tomorrow, you'd never know it was here. So that's it, huh? All done? Yeah. (SIGHS) I thought you'd be relieved. I am. So, once you got me out of your hair, then what? I've been thinking about what your mama said. And about how cuttin' up matchbooks is part of making meth. (CHUCKLES) You doing a lot of thinking. (CHUCKLES) I guess so. I got this idea they're kinda connected, you know? I don't got it figured out in my head yet, but.. ...it's like.. Like, in our life, everyone we meet is a chemical reaction. They change us and we change them. 'Cause we changed, we can go on and have different reactions with other people. And we don't always know how it will end up. We don't. Like the matchbooks, they don't know how they're gonna end up. But just 'cause we can't see a plan.. ...that don't mean there ain't one. Anyway, it made me feel a little better about things.. ...thinking it all fit together somehow. Cousin. It's nice to see you too. Hi, L-O-L. Hey.. See, hey, hey! Ain't you gonna say nothin' about my duds, huh? Nice duds. We'll be back tomorrow with your cut. You're welcome. So that's it? All clear? Well, we should probably lay low for a little bit. I'll go pick up the truck around noon and drop you off with the state police. What'll I tell them? Tell 'em the truth. I'll be cleared out of here by dark. You're leavin'? It's time. You can only sit still so long. Besides, there's too many ghosts in these woods. I guess I can give this back now. Keep it. A conversation piece, for all the friends you're gonna make in DC. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, I'm not so sure that they're gonna.. (DOOR SLAMS) (CHUCKLES) You old dog. This explains everything! Well, you could've just told me. - He didn't want to share. - And he shouldn't have to. So what if we seen her first? That don't mean nothin' to me when it comes to Cousin Lowell's happiness. N... now, now, now you just, you just hold on there, Lowell. You proven to be pretty untrustworthy lately and I don't think we can leave it up to you to do the right thing here. So this little lady.. ...is just gonna have to come with us now. Take a seat, Holli. We ain't got time to be havin' this conversation, Lowell. Make time. Won't take long. Sawyer, honey.. ...you mind heating me up a cup of that coffee? It's okay. Just fetch the coffee. I swear I should've known. We been all through these goddamn woods. Here's the thing.. ...I know what has to get done. And I'll take care of it.. ...in my time. But for now.. ...would you just let me have some fun? I mean, you see how trained I got her, don't you? That's it, baby. Now, get over here and sit on my knee. (LAUGHING) Goddamn! You sure do got some things to teach me, boy. And the thing is, if it was up to me... - Holli? - H... hang on, Buck. I think there's something wrong... Hang on a second, the thing is though it ain't just up to me.. But, Holli, the microwave.. (EXPLOSION) (COUGHING) (EXPLOSION) (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (LOWELL BREATHING HEAVILY) (GROANING) Come on! (SAWYER BREATHING HEAVILY) (BOTH GRUNTING) Please! (LOWELL GRUNTING) I can't. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (BREATHING HEAVILY) You remember Bishop's Road? I can't.. You're gonna be okay. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GRUNTING) Run! (LOWELL GRUNTING) (HOLLISTER GRUNTING) (HOLLISTER GROANING) (GUNSHOT) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (HOLLISTER GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GUNSHOT) (BOTH GRUNTING) (LOWELL GROANING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (HOLLISTER SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) Easy now. (GROANING) Don't do nothin' stupid. Yous about all the stupid this family needs. Why'd you go and do all this? For some girl? (HOLLISTER BREATHING HEAVILY) What does it matter? (BREATHING HEAVILY) It's done. Sheriff. (GUNSHOT) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GUNSHOT) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Jesus! That fucking Lowell. (SIGHING) She was here the whole goddamn time. (EXHALING) - Is the meth.. - The cruiser, down the way. Thank God. That girl run off, O'Doyle. Through them woods headed toward Bishop's Road. I'mma go after her. - You circle around the road. - Okay. And I'll flush her out to you. Yeah, yeah, that's, uh.. ...good thinkin' there. (GROANING) Don't forget your gun there. Right. (GROANING) Fuck! (HOLLISTER GROANING) (GROANING) (HOLLISTER BREATHING HEAVILY) Go on, pick it up. (GROANING) (GROANING) Come on, boy. (HOLLISTER SIGHING) O'Doyle.. Ah.. You can't. We're partners. Go ahead. I won't. I won't, I won't do it. You can't shoot me if I ain't armed. (LAUGHING) You think I'm concerned with the forensics on a known felon shot outside a burning meth house? (BREATHING HEAVILY) Son, I just wanted you to feel like you had a fighting chance. (GUNSHOTS) You didn't. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (COUGHING) (COUGHING) (SIGHING) (COUGHING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) So you're saying.. ...this Lowell Pritchert guy.. ...was holding you? No, not holding me. Hiding me. Oh, okay, from, uh, from these other fellas that was after you. Why aren't you calling this in? He could still be alive. Hold on now there, miss. No sense in callin' anything in until I get all the facts. (SIGHING) (O'DOYLE SNIFFLES) So these other fellas, uh.. ...was it just the two of them? Hmm. Buck and Hollister. They all work for somebody else but I never saw him. Shouldn't you at least call an ambulance or back-up or somethin'? Well, now, here's the deal you're just gonna have to trust my way of doin' things 'cause around here.. Well, I'm the chief.. ...you're the Indian. So, this third guy, you never saw him? Did you get a name? No. A voice? - Um, what? - A voice? Did you hear him? What his voice sound like? Oh.. I don't know, just.. ...just normal, just a normal voice. Hmm. So you wouldn't recognize him if you heard him again. No. I definitely wouldn't know. (SIGHING) I think we're gonna walk the rest of the way. (O'DOYLE GRUNTING) (DOOR OPENING) Come on now. Just go on down a little further there.. ...down by the water. (SIGHING) They call this Rust Creek.. ...because of all the clay deposits up the hill. Turned the water red. And they mined up all the clay before I was born. That name stuck though. Let's go on now. Okay. Okay. You don't have to do this. Hm. In the water. (O'DOYLE GRUNTING) (SAWYER SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (BOTH GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (O'DOYLE GRUNTING) (GASPING) (O'DOYLE SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (GASPING) (O'DOYLE GRUNTING) (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) (O'DOYLE GRUNTING) (SAWYER SCREAMING) (O'DOYLE GRUNTING) (GASPING) (GROANING) (O'DOYLE GRUNTING) (O'DOYLE GRUNTING) (SAWYER GRUNTING) (O'DOYLE GROANING) (GRUNTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GROANING) (SAWYER SCREAMING) (O'DOYLE GROANING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SAWYER BREATHING HEAVILY) (POLICE SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) (POLICE SIREN WAILING) (POLICE SIREN WAILING) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Subtitles by explosiveskulll ♥ Colored ♥ by ♥ Bond25 ♥ (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (MUSIC CONTINUES)
