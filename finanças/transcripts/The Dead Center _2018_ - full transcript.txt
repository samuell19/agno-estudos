Here to examine the John Doe suicide reported last night. That's actually what we were discussing. We have a problem. Good morning, Mr. Alan. How you doing? Brought you some breakfast. Need to check your vitals, though, and then you can eat everything that you want. Let me see here... Hello? When were you assigned to this room? Let's just get you up here. Let's get you to sit up. Yeah, there you go. Good. Can you hear me? I'm gonna go get some help. (HEART THUMPING) Good morning. Well... - You found him here like this? - Yes. Can you hear me? Do you know where you are, sir? I don't know, his lungs are clear, his rhythm's good. Maybe he's off his meds. Look, put a gown on him, call Psych... I've a good candidate for residential treatment. - Who's this for? - Patient is Kevin Burke. He has a history of meth abuse, depression. I've seen him a few times over the years. I think he's got a good shot at getting clean this time, though. I really do. It says here that we already gave him a shot last year. - Yes. - And he walked out after a few days. But this is a window and we should take it, I'm telling you. Daniel, when they walk out like that, the hospital ends up paying for the entire 30 days. Sarah, this is different. This man had a significant break. Kevin is ready. Tell me, where is Kevin Burke right now? Did you already admit him into our unit? - Of course I did. - Of course you did. - It's temporary, Sarah, till we can... - Of course you did! Jesus! - Get him into residential... - Jesus, Daniel! - Is he a danger to himself or others? - I put him on hold... Is he a danger to himself or others? To look at our case load, you'd think we're running a drug rehab program. The floor's admittance rate has gotten out of control. Do you even know what we do here? We're the ones who provide the drugs. - The danger's not treating the patients! - Daniel... There's only one thing you can do here and that's get them a minute of clarity... We have gone over this, Daniel... I know I can help, and you won't let me do that. You're being way too comfortable with me right now. I was gonna wait to tell you this. For the time being, anyone admitted into our unit needs to be first approved by me. - Are you kidding? - No, I'm not. So, you're gonna personally supervise every consult now? No... Just you. (LAUGHS) - Hey, Doc? - Huh? Eval 1. John Doe. Nobody has any idea where he came from? That seems to be the case. How's that even possible? Hi, I'm Dr. Forrester. Do you know where you are? Can you hear me? You know what's gonna happen if we don't take him? Medicine's gonna put him in a corner and forget about him. You can't think about that around here. Sorry, what's that? I'm sorry. Say that again, please. Mm-hmm. How'd that make you feel? Yeah, I imagine so. Did you hear that? - What? - He spoke. - He did? - Mm-hmm. He says he's suffering from depression, suicidal thoughts, he's threatening self-harm. Isn't that what you heard? This man is an absolute danger to himself. I'm admitting him on a 5150.

It was me that called it in. Just all this crazy screaming, yelling. It sounded like the guy was arguing with someone, going back and forth, real crazy. So I knocked on the door, but he didn't answer, so I take my key, but the guy slams the door in my face. That's when I called the show.
