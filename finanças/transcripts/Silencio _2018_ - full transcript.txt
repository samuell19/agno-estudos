- Engines at 85%. Both engines at nominal. The launch speed 2400, 688 per second. Altitude 8.2 nautical miles. 12 minutes and 16 seconds. Gun range distance eight nautical miles. Flight controls reporting a deviation from target. It has entered foreign territory. Reporting flight dynamics, officer, that the vehicle has exploded. Recovery forces have been alerted. - Today a missile test headed for White Sands, New Mexico inexplicably, went off course and crashed in what is called the Zone of Silence, the Bermuda Triangle, Mexico, a mysterious area acting like a magnetic vortex for meteors and other space debris. Mutated plants and animals are common here as well as communication and equipment failure. The President has issued an apology to the Mexican Government and sent a team of scientists from around the world to clean the debris. In other news, South Vietnam released 86 POWs. - This area is closed. Everyone step back and go home. - They shouldn't be this close to the site, especially at this hour. They're just curious. They'll be gone soon. - Hey! - Doctor. I found some of the cobalt. - Hmm, this could be the last of it. It's dark. It looks like Allende. Let's get back to the lab. - Copy go. I'm already done, 3:28 a.m. Again 3:28. - It is good to have you back, doctor. I'm so sorry for what happened. Such a terrible tragedy. - Thank you, Peter. I'd rather not talk about it. Let's focus. Work takes my mind off it. - I think, it will do you good. - The people out there any of them get near the cobalt? - Some kids were close, but I didn't see anyone touch it. - Good. It truly is far more radioactive than we first thought. Heat from the explosion must have altered it. Doctor James White, reporting from the Zone of Silence, July 27, 1970. Unusual activity was persistent in the air here. Radio communications continue to fail. We scanned the perimeter, and we were able to locate the last missing piece of the missile. Traces of uranium were located in the secondary area, which will be sent back for further study. God. - Do you think the black one could be a piece of the endometrite? - It appears so. I'll examine it to confirm. Some of the cobalt spilled on it. Peter, don't touch that without gloves! For God's sake. - Sorry, Doctor, of course. Your gloves, Doctor. - I'm sorry. Thank you, Peter. - Doctor! - I can't see. Where am I? What's happening to us? - What is this? - What is this place? What. What. Where are we, Peter? - Hey. Grandpa, you found us. We were going to surprise you. I took a picture for you. - Oh, my god. No, I don't understand. I have you back again. Peter! Peter, take her! Move! Noelle, move out of the way! No! Move, quickly, move! Move out of the way! Move away! Move, move, move, move! Move out of the way! Quickly move! - Mommy! - No, no. No. No, no, no, no, no, no. You stay with me, my love. Why did this happen, God? You must stay. Stay with me. Stay with me. - How long has he been like this? - Not too long. Sometimes he doesn't remember anything at all, and other days he's completely normal. - Doctor, do you remember that you called me last week? - I called you. - Yeah. Do you know who I am? I'm Peter. I have a daughter now. Here she is. - I'm sorry he doesn't recognize you. - Okay. Look here are my contact details. Can you tell Ana that I urgently need to speak with her. - Of course. - Thank you. Bye, old friend. - I'll walk you out. - Thank you. And thank you for your help today. - You're welcome. Maybe next time he'll feel better. - Hello. Hi, Grandpa. Hi, it's me. - I had the strangest day today. One of my patients he mentioned Lisa. And he gave me a lot of specific details about what happened. And then I went to see Felix's school teacher. Apparently, they're struggling a little bit with him. He's being a naughty boy. Grandpa. Grandpa, I have no one to talk to but you. You've always guided me. Now I don't know what I'm supposed to do. The silence is so hard. Say something. Please don't leave us. I'm not ready yet, not really. - I know this has been hard for you, but I'm very proud of how you're doing. Come on sit down here. Look. You see this plant? - Yes, purple. It's my favorite color. - It's beautiful, isn't it? You know, they're purple only in this place. Normally, they're green. - I wish Lisa could see this. I wish they could all come back. - Yes. I've missed them terribly too. - I miss the hugs. - Oh, well. Well, come here. I'll give you all the hugs in the world. But, you know. I have a secret. My hugs have magical powers. I do. Every time I give you one everything that's wrong in the world will be okay, and you'll be strong. - I want another one. - Yeah. You know, we are all we have left. It's only you and I now. But, I will always protect you. I promise you. - I love you. - I love you more. I love this place because this is where I found you again. - I love you. - The Bolson de Mapimi Desert, at its center is an area known as the Zone of Silence because according to various reports in the region, communications and radio equipment commonly fail in the area. And this was first reported back in 1939 by the pioneering Mexican pilot Francisco Sarabia. All the equipment in his plane failed, and he was forced into making an emergency landing. It lies between the 26th and the 28th parallel in the northern latitude, which is the same line, interestingly, that runs through the Bermuda Triangle and the Pyramids in Egypt. According to a theory by Dr. W. James Downs, during the Jurassic period a giant meteorite collided with the Earth in the Zone of Silence, and it created quite considerable magnetic distortion. And some believe it is still buried underground now. Because millions of years later in 1969, the largest ever known carbonaceous chondrite meteor, the Allende, crashed. And it may have been attracted by the magnetic pull. And when we discovered it, we found some very unusual isotopic compositions, which suggested processes that occurred in stars that existed billions of years before our solar system was ever formed. This stone contains evidence of the origins of the entire universe. - I'd like to introduce you to, a wonderful man on the screen, and a wonderful scientist, my mentor Dr. James White. He was a pioneer, one of the first scientists to study this extraordinary zone. We took 80 railway wagons full of material away to be analyzed, which is a hell of a lot. If any alien was looking down from the skies and saw a great big crater in the middle of the desert, he might have thought, "Oh, a meteorite has landed." But, no, it was just us overzealous scientists. Thank you so much for inviting me here. It's been my absolutely pleasure. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Goodbye. - Lisa! What day is it? Eight days, no memory. I only got five hours. - Grandpa. - Felix, what are you doing out of bed? - Where are you going? - Do you remember the story I told you about the magic stone? - Yeah. - Well, I have to find it because somebody's in desperate need of it. And I have to find it before my mind goes to sleep again. I've lost a lot of time, so I have to find it today. Hmm? - Can I come with you? - Oh, no. No, no, no, you should be in bed. We don't want to worry your mother. But I will come back soon, I promise you. And when I do, we'll go for ice cream. - Yeah. - Yes. In you go. Sweet dreams, my darling boy. Peter. Let's see. God, the tree was over there. That tree is gone. This is my favorite. - If it's your favorite, then it's mine too. - Let me show you something. Wow. - Watch. These are old pieces of meteorite. They're all over this place, millions of them, and that's what makes this place so special. Do you want to try? - Yes. - Okay. Ready? - Wow, it's magic! - It most certainly is, my dear. You know, of all the places in the whole wide world this is where most meteorites land. - Wow. - Yeah. There's something special under the earth that attracts them. - What is it? - We don't know yet. That's why we come to work here to study the place. - Grandpa, look it's a turtle! - Oh, oh, oh, oh. - She's coming this way. - Shh, this is no ordinary turtle. Even the turtles and the plants are special here. - She's beautiful. May I touch her? - Yes, but very gently. We have to look after her, you know. It's almost extinct, very rare. And look, and look! Her eyes are yellow to protect her from the sun. - She's beautiful. - She is. - Just like the one we saw on that day. - 10 paces, 10. 10. - Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa. Shit. Grandpa. - Ana. Ana. - Grandpa, where were you? - Where's Felix? - But what do you mean where's Felix? He's right there. - I went to look for it, and I couldn't find it. - Look for what? - No, no, no, I couldn't find it. It's of the utmost importance that I find that stone today, so please I'm going to need your help. - Okay, um. - It is a matter of life and death. We're all in danger. They want the stone, and they will stop at nothing to get it. - You have to calm down. - Don't tell me you're not understanding me. I am the only one who knows where it is. I haven't shared that location with anyone. I have to find it. - Okay, Grandpa, why don't you sit down? I'll make you a cup of tea. - I don't want a cup of tea. The tree I couldn't find the tree, so. And I dug, and I dug, and I dug, and I dug. Three, 10 paces, 10 paces to where! - No, Grandpa, you're not making any sense, okay. You're not making any sense, okay. Why don't you just breathe. Just breathe. - Peter. Peter. I'll have Peter tell. - What was that? - It's eight o'clock. He's come for it. - Who's come for what? - He's come for it. - Who's come for what, Grandpa? - Shh, shh, I want you to go up here. Come, come. - Grandpa. - Felix, come upstairs with us, darling. Come upstairs, please. How about we go and play hide and seek? Come on now. - Grandpa, I still don't know what's going on? - Please, just. - You're not gonna leave the house again, are you? - Please just go in there and we'll play. I'm not gonna leave the house at all. I want you to stay in here. - Don't leave the house, no. - I'm not leaving the house, darling. Now please have fun, yes. Shh, be very quiet though. - Shh, shh, shh. Grandpa. - Ana, you have to be very quiet. Keep Felix very quiet. This man is dangerous. - Please, be careful. - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Ana. I love you. - I love you. Come come. Come, come, come. What's going on here? Who are you? You want these. Please, take whatever you want. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no, no. Ah! - Señor. Señor. Señor. No. - No! No! No! No! - Mom! - Do not hurt my baby! - Okay! Okay! - Okay. - No! - Mama! - Felix! - Mama! - No please! - Mama! You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. Stay with me. Stay with me. - Oh, Ana, come, come. You've gotta see this, huh? - Not today, Grandpa. - What do you mean not today? You're missing out. - I'm just feeling a bit blue, that's all. - Hey. It's this baby boy that's going to join us in the world very shortly. It's the greatest gift in the universe. - Just afraid. It's just gonna be tough raising him on my own. - You won't be on your own. I'll give that boy more love than he can handle. - I know. - So, I want you to pull yourself together now, and I want my old Ana back, all right? We've been through so much, you and I. I know that you can handle anything that life throws at you. You have the strength. You just gotta find it again. It's up to you, huh, up to you. - Ana. - I need your help. - Well. And I'm so, so, so sorry. - Yeah, thank you. I need to find that stone. I need to find it today. - I've never told anybody this before. It's very difficult to put into words. - Try, please. - It's was just after the American rocket had crashed, and some of the radioactive material that it was carrying got onto a piece of the Allende meteorite. And we took it back to the lab. But, there was an accident. And it ended up with your grandfather handling the stone, which is highly toxic. It was 3:33 a.m. exactly. We think that maybe the, um some of the burning hydrazine and the cobalt might have released some of the hybrid elements in the inclusions in the stone. We just don't know. We don't know what happened or how. In that moment when your grandfather was holding the stone, we found ourselves at the side of a highway. - Okay, what are you getting at? - What do you remember about the day of your family's accident? - I remember seeing my grandad. And I ran towards him. And I left my family behind. - Do you remember anything else? Okay, was there anybody else with your grandfather? - Oh, my god, it was you. - Yeah. - It never made sense to him. The accident had happened a week before. And there were no survivors, no one not even you. - What? - We went back to that precise moment that your grandfather managed to save your life. That's one of the powers of the stone. We did experiments. We did tests, we tried everything. We discovered that it only works at 3:33 a.m., and that if you wanna save somebody, you have to hold the stone and think of them. But if you do save a life, then you actually exchange it for another one. Because weeks later somebody else very close to your grandfather passed away. - Wendy. Wendy, what's wrong, my love. Wendy. Wendy, no. No, no, no. Oh, god, not you. - My Nana. - It seems that, actually, the world is made up of energy. That the world knows how to balance that energy. But sooner or later the energies will self correct. And if you save somebody, the consequences could be unpredictable and terrible. - So why did he hide the stone? - 'Cause he was scared. There were rumors that already got out about what we were doing in the lab, and he wasn't sure that humanity was ready. And he didn't want anyone else to use the stone because the consequence could be you. The results were highly unpredictable. And he didn't wanna risk losing your again. He wanted to save the stone for you in case one day you would need it. - And he never told you where he hid it. You don't know where it is? - No. That's buried like your grandfather's stone. He use today keep it in a little aluminum box with his initials on it. Why won't you call the police? - No, no, no, I can't. I can't risk it. - Would you like me to help you? You okay? - Yeah, I have to go. Thank you. - Come in. - Professor, it's time for your interview. - Ah, thank you. - I'll be outside. - Okay. - One last question. - Yes. - What else can it do? - What do you mean? - The stone you said it had many powers. What else can it do? - Well, it seems to have some clairvoyant properties. - What do you mean? - Well your grandfather could see your family. He had a lot of contact with your grandmother and your sister Lisa. - Okay, thank you. - Shall I come with you? - No, I'll go on my own. I'll call you later. Thank you. - Bye, bye. - Anymore questions? - I'm afraid that that's all the time we have. - All right, sorry, that's all the time we have, sorry. Thank you for coming. Thank you. - Your car is already outside waiting for you, Professor. - Alright, look, this is Ana's number. Could you get her on the phone for me? - Alright, sir. - Thank you. - Please, Lisa, help me. - Mom, look, a giant turtle! - Oh, I see it! - Could we pull over and take a picture? - We're going to be late, dear? - But we stopped to pick up Lisa's flowers. - Hey, you ruined them. - Ana, be nice. - It won't take long. Just one picture, please? - Alright, it better be a quick one then. - Go. - Turtle. - It is. - Mom, come look. - Come on. Okay. - No. Shit. - Ana. Ana. - Where are you? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Beautiful girl. I never take it off, ever. Felix. No. No. No, no, no, no. No! - Hello. - Peter, I found it. - You have to be very, very careful with it. No, no, no, no, I'm gonna come straight over. - Oh, god. - Ana, what's happening? - Peter, what are you doing here? I told you not to come. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. You've got to leave now. - What's this? - Nothing. - What's happening? - You've gotta leave. - Who's this? - He's the man who killed my son and my grandad. - Whoa, we need to call the police. - No, no, no, no, calling the police. I'm taking care of this, okay. Just please go. - What happened to this leg? - I did it. - No, I did it. Look, Peter, you either leave now, or you watch someone else die tonight. - No, no, no, Ana, that's not happening. - A man will be here any minute now, and I do not want you involved. - Ana we need to handle this. - Don't worry, I'll take care of her. - Okay, we'll I'm staying too. - Fine. - She said that she had the stone here, is that right? - Yeah, we found it. - Okay, good. Is she okay? - Well, she's upset, she lost her son. - Yeah, but she's talking about killing a guy. - What do you wanna do? We cannot call the police? - Why can't you call the police? - We have this guy tied. - Yeah, but he broke in your house. He's killed your-- It's not what you think. I can explain everything. It's not what you think. - How could you? - No, listen, listen. - How could you? - Listen, listen. It's more complicated than you think. Listen. Enough! Listen to me! I have a daughter. A few ago she woke up with a very intense headache. We took her to the hospital, and after a few tests they said, "Well, she just had a very simple migraine." Week later, got worse. We took her to the hospital again. This time they said she had a blood clot in her brain, and it's too late it was inoperable. She was gonna die. A few days later she died. Now do you remember that I said there was a time limit to use the stone? Well, my time limit is tomorrow. - Why didn't you ask my grandfather for it? He would have given you the stone. - Because your grandfather was selfish! He didn't wanna share the stone with anybody! Look, we're running out of time. Now I will do whatever it takes to save my daughter the same as you would do for your son. - If I have to kill you, I will. I swear to God I will kill you. - All right. Come here. - No. - Come here. Come here. Come here. - Let him go, no! - If I have to kill the both of you, I will do it. We are running out of time, and if you wanna kill me, you'll have to go through him first. - 3:31. 3:31 two minutes. Only two minutes until I get to see my son again. - Ana, think this through. If you use the stone, you can only change one thing. You're gonna have to make a choice. You're gonna have to chose between your grandfather or your son. If you give the stone to me, I can change everything. - How? - Well, if you give me the stone, then I don't have to come into your lives, and nobody has to die because I can change something that happened before any of this occurred. I know what is wrong with my daughter. I can get her what she needs. She will have surgery, and she will live. And I cannot let my daughter die. It's against the natural order of things. - But if I use it, I have the certainty of seeing my son again. You understand that, don't you? - But if you use the stone to save your son, it's most likely that in this case, you will exchange your life for your son's. You will be the consequence, do you understand? - You have two options. The first one is that you use the stone, but it's most likely then you'll leave your kid on his own without anybody to look after him, no family, no mother, no grandfather. Who wins in that scenario? What kind of life would he have being an orphan? If you let me use the stone, that way my life will most likely be the consequence. - No! No! - I have nothing left to lose. - I failed my boy. I couldn't protect him. I couldn't protect him. - Ana, life is cruel. It's cruel. But we have a way out. I know that deep down you know I'm right. Please. Give me the stone. - I love the moon. It makes everything shine like silver. Of course, you know that you are the brightest light in my life. I promised to look after you and to protect and I have. - Hmm, yeah. - But the day will come when that moon will no longer shine for me. - Oh, no, no, I don't wanna talk about that. - I know you don't want to talk about it, but we have to. Now when the day comes, you will have to be brave. And you must know that you have been the greatest joy in my life. You must know that if I could change something in our lives together, I wouldn't change a thing. And when that day comes, then you must remember that. You must. - Polly. - Mama. - Hmm, pancakes! - Can we leave now, Dad? - Yeah. That's just something I needed to do. Thank you, Ana. Dear Ana, you probably don't remember me, but it's only a matter of time before you do. I wanna thank you for what you have done for me and my daughter. The stone fixed it all. Everything is now as it should be except for one thing. There are a couple of details that I left out intentionally. What I failed to mention was that your present would be modified most of the time that is for the better remember everything in this world balances itself out. You've living in an alternate present now, and in this time, my dear friend, your grandfather is no longer with us. - This is the place we loved the most. - In the box you'll find your grandfather's stone. I am in my last moments of this life, and I have no regrets. Everything is as it should be. And now you have to make another decision. There are two options, Ana. The first one is for you to use the stone to save your grandfather. And the second one is not to use it now, so that you can use it later. Felix is safe thanks to the stone. But maybe you'll need it in the future. In my opinion, your grandfather and I have lived our lives to the fullest, and now the world belongs to all of you. But, of course, this decision is yours alone to make. I am forever grateful for what you've done. Peter.
