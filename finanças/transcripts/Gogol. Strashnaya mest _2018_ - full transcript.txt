(horse neigh) Near the village of Dikanka began to find dead girls ' bodies. Near the crime scene always we saw some horseman. An investigator who knows how to disclose the most difficult cases. - I can be of service to you. - Well, look, Gogol. Alexander Christofori Binh. Head of the local police Department.

Get me the Wii! He's not breathing. What are you burning about? (sighs) Vasilina. Memorize. Sho I say just that one it's true. Mr. Gogol was a man of God. The great soul man he was. And if who against him fucking word will tell, spit. Not believe. What you're talking about pan Gogol like a dead man? He didn't. Dona, you're right. His soul is immortal. And forever will live in our hearts. God rest his soul. Not what they say! No, he's not dead (horse neigh) Well? Found a place? - Found. All right. Tomorrow at dawn will produce the burial ceremony. Anything else? Alexander Christofori. You only me Chub my don't pull. I'm in no way an expert.... Why did you take Mr. inquirer secretly bury? Well, is he a criminal or something, which, so it is on the fringe like a dog to bury? Please let me explain. Tomorrow the cemetery will bury dead on the farm. Who died through the fault of Mr. investigator. And if we bury Gogol, along with them, there is the start. People's excitement. God forbid, revolt. And who, I ask you, do you? And from what you understand took that maiden on the farm died from-for Nicholas Vasilyevich? And who invited them on this a bloody farm? He offered. You ordered it. All right. I hope the doctor's already opened the body. I need an exact cause of death. for the report. Alexander Khristoforovich. The doctor refuses to cut the investigator. That is how refuses? What's this sabotage? Why don't you start the autopsy? You know, I now completely out of condition. I have this condition, that I can't perform an autopsy. I'm afraid to make a mistake. You're in excellent condition. You and strong intoxication never hurt to work. - Don't be a fool, go ahead. I won't. Are you sane? You Dodge direct orders. I don't care. Leopold Leopold, come to your senses. What's going on with you guys, anyway? He was my only friend. I'm not going to dig into it. And you just don't have a heart. Alexander Christofori, what kind of excesses? Ashamed to say, your people do not give my master sing. That's right. If we don't, we'll drink. - What? - Nothing. Where are you going to sing it? - Where? Properly, in the temple. I've been working with father Bartholomew agreed. - Out of the question. - We don't have to draw attention. God be with you. Long to sin. Can't father the funeral service in the mortuary to pick. Alexander Christofori, and it's not Christian at all. Where else? Tomorrow the priest will read leaving the graveyard, that's all. That's right, you hold my master evil. Not deal with the dead to fight. You have no cross, Mr. Binh. Well, that's fine. I'm responsible for the girls ' deaths. I have no heart and no cross. Hmm, I wouldn't be surprised if thunder killed me. (sighs) Where are you, my beloved Falcon? Get up and come to my place. (sighs) In sight, not combustible tears my. Not in being able to warm me and Wake your soul. From what there is no you nor among survivors not the dead? (cries) Where art thou? Find you? A loving heart will hear and find everything. And we will be inseparable forever. Have mercy on me, o God, by your great mercy, And according to the multitude of thy compassions blot out my transgression. Chiefly of Amy me from mine iniquity, from my sin cleanse me, as my iniquity, I know, and my sin before me removed. God rest the soul of the deceased your slave Nicholas, Elika in the life of Sam as a man sinned, Thou, thou art the lover of mankind God, forgive him and have mercy and deliver me from eternal torment The heavenly Kingdom to share in. Soon to bury the rest will suffer. We should hurry. ...create something useful. Amen. Wait. I would... I wanted to say a little farewell speech. Nikolai Vasilyevich was a man an extraordinary mind. He was human... Well, nothing is out of the question plant. Let's lower the coffin. (Baumgart crying) (boards crack) From bizovi soul. From rot the coffin of the have made. - Hands off. - A lot of coffins had to be made. Fresh boards on the maiden and the Cossacks left. And this Herod and rotten boards enough. Let's hurry. We can't bury him till Christmas. Lower. - Bury. - Wait! Why are you burying someone alive? - Daughter. - He's not dead. He's alive! (some crackling) Dad? What does that mean? I died? I'm sorry, Nicholas. Sorry about what? All that was wrong before you. Guilty. What's your fault, father? I don't understand? I shouldn't. (laughter)) Father your blame your eternity to redeem will be, not redeem. He has a hard life in the other world. His soul burns in Hellfire. His soul burns in Hellfire. And as long as it burns, you'll live. Live, Black one! (laughs) (people crying) Well, thank God, we did. Excuse me, sir. I couldn't keep you safe. Better be me, old fool., lay down in this damp earth. (Yakim crying) Help! Help! Help! Ow! The Heavenly Queen! Lisa, stop! Lisa, don't, you're bothering me. (coughs) No, no, no more compresses. It is now impossible to make a coarse meal. Go make him some gruel. I'll cook, mA'am, be quiet. How are you feeling? Thanks. Already good. It's a miracle you're alive. Gentlemen, I'm afraid to disappoint you. No miracle in the resurrection Mr. Gogol's gone. Simply Nikolai Vasilyevich for 2 days fell into lethargy. - Lethargy? - Quite true. These things are known to science as a deep sleep like death. By the way, a similar case occurred in 1785 in Toulouse. The Marquis de Mercier fell in lethargic sleep for 3 days. And imagine waking up in a coffin. at his own funeral., a lot of amazement of their relatives. One of the men even died. Marvelous are thy works, o Lord. I've got to go. Yakim, don't give these gentlemen tire him out, okay? Be quiet. Lisa. - The porridge is cooked, lady. - What? Oh, yeah. Thanks, Christina. Why are you so pale? Did something bad happen? No, no, it's fine. Yes? Dawn-zarenitsa the sky walked. Sky walked, collected tears. Tears collected, lost the keys. Dawn. Admit it, where did you come from? About what? About being alive. Knew and all. Gentlemen, I'm very happy, that everything turned out so happily. - Correct. - Thank You. - Doctor. - Yes? Tell me, how do you think, Mr. Gogol can get up and go? Well, generally... Although I would advise complete rest. I'm perfectly healthy. - Cutlass. - Huh? Bring two Cossacks. Ah? - Bring two Cossacks. - All right, it'll be done. Get dressed. 212. 00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,290 You're under arrest, Mr. Gogol. Or how do you want me to address you? Mr. horseman? What are you doing, huh? To have you run over. Made here made the court good man! Do. And the not'll take a look, that you from capital, by force'll drive. Ghoul damned. Do not be angry, Nikolai. Service-S. Leave my master alone, damned. Yes what kind of rogue you are bitten? - Lock him up! Lock me up. I'm not leaving my master. Alexander Christofori, what the hell is going on here? Why did you decide, that rider is me? Well, the rider or accomplice this investigation will understand. Explain to you? Well, please. Well, I think, to tell-in detail like girls., which we are at your suggestion sent to the farm, died all to the last along with the guards, no need? Dead? How he died? It's amazing how clever you are. pretending and pretending to be ignorant. But the child understands that you have attitude to their death. That girls on the farm, we knew you and the dead Cossacks. But once you have had a special relationship with the horseman. Well, how else would he know where to find them? We send village girls on an abandoned farm near Dikanka. - Your wife should go with them. - But I don't think so. Danishevsky. About this still knew Danishevsky. Listen, Alexander Khristoforovich. I urged the count Danishevsky, to send Lisa to this farm. with the girls. He needs to be detained now! What kind of person are you? No conscience. You blame the count because you have designs on his wife. It has nothing to do with this. You're making a big mistake. A big mistake I made, when I decided to trust you. Alexander Khristoforovich, listen. Count Danishevsky horseman! He killed 7 girls! And the last victim must become Lisa! He'll kill her! (cries) Sad, Mavka? You see me? Well, I'm not blind then. I am people only, whenever I want to. So the people. Have no fear. I have a question for you. I want to offer you a deal. As far as I know, you're unrequited. in love with Mr. Gogol. He's a sweet young man, but lately too much fuss and interfere with my business. And I really don't want him... kill. And you can keep him alive... and win his love. How is that winning? He's alive and I'm dead. I can you... quicken. I'll bring you back from the dead, and you will., I want Gogol to love you.. And left here for good. You're making it soft. But, of course, everything has its price. The one who agrees to pass rite of resurrection, comes to life and lives as all. But after death goes straight to hell. But you can live with a loved one for a lifetime. Isn't that worth it? Mm? Well, how... Gogol won't love me? He same in zhinku your in love with. And she in him. You don't have to worry about Lisa. She won't bother you anymore. Never. Well, so what? I agree. Alexander Khristoforych, I'm sorry. I can't figure out your intent. Here you have arrested Nikolai Vasilyevich. Why? Well, because Nikolai Vasilyevich the confidence trickster and a cunning killer in one person. Wait, so you think, that Nikolai Vasilyevich and there is the sorcerer the murderer? He's not a sorcerer at all. After this story with lethargy, I was finally convinced that, that he had mastered the art of magic. similar theme, that entertain the crowd wandering circus performers at fairs. But the first girls were killed even before the arrival of Nikolai Vasilyevich. Al wrong? How do we know, where it was before... he deigned to come to our land. But they came-with with Yakov Petrovich? But Yakov Petrovich, unfortunately, is dead. And so I'm afraid anything in this story it's unclear. Damn you, dog children. Let us out, we're innocent! Yakim, shouting won't solve anything. Sir, how can you be so calm? Well, how will the court be unrighteous now? We have it here all the time. And sentence you. What good will take and hang. What do you think, and a third resurrection? For the third time? - Sir, you just heard me. - No, I didn't hear that. You said the third time. Yakim, what are you hiding from me? Does it have something to do with my childhood? With my birth? You were born difficult. You were chosen. Live, Black one! Forgive me, Nicholas. Yakim, tell me the truth. Oh boy.... Well, sir. Scream like hell. Don't back off anyway. You're right, you know, that your two older brothers born dead. Yes. And when your mother the third time suffered, your father was very frightened, that a dead man would be born again. And just at this time in our neighborhood a gentleman appeared. And your father started doing business with him. And this gentleman's appearance she was strange. What's strange? - At it... I don't even know how to put it. No nose. Such a direct feeling, that he took from him and escaped. Hoc. (laughs) And that's when the time came you be born and the midwife you from your mother the belly-then got, you're dead. He's not breathing. Oh, as I recall, hitherto... blood runs cold. From him then underground dampness it smelled. Live, Black one. He said so. - Live, Black one. - Exactly what he said. Why haven't I heard this story before? Your father... the ban imposed on this story. What you saw with your eyes, strictly forget. This... Lord... - she never came back? Never came back. Oh, my God, save and preserve. That damned Herod. What about him you haven't said anything once? He was even when he was tipsy. all he kept saying was, like a murderer. And he was himself, wasn't he? I can't really take that. What's the easiest way to avoid a chase? You need to lead it. The beast disguised, when he's stalking the victim. That's the killer... impersonating a servant of the law. Yes. That's the more you think, the more you do not know, what's in the mind of something happening. And I have here, Alexander Christofori, one more thing's not gonna work out. As Mr. interrogator could maiden on the farm to kill, if exactly at the same time was he in Church? I am sovereign. keep order here and he took 7 girls to the slaughter. He's either a horseman or an accomplice. There's no third. Yes. - Let's get rid of the impure force. - Run! What's that? That's just not enough. How many people are left keep watch? - You. - Go. Riot decided to inflict. If they don't go their separate ways., until called the shots. To shoot then no one will. All children have five heads. Come on. Okay! Come on, everybody go to the huts! No ghoul will not leave! Let's not. There's no ghoul here. Breaks he, brothers! Definitely sick! With my own eyes divisa, Yak they sorcerer-murderer saaristomeri were! There is no sorcerer here. And no one will give you the arrested! It is protected Russian empire and is going to trial! (crowd screaming) - We're not leaving until you do! - Burn their junk! Okay! Who said that? Hey, are you trying to rebel? All in Siberia go! Not like it or good, hut burn down Alexander Khristoforovich! (crowd screaming) Vakula! Trouble! Cossacks rebelled! Want Nikolai to kill! And the power of what? And we have no more power. Let my master. He's not guilty of anything. Shut up, you old chicken. We'll fry you, too. What are you doing? You're all in penal servitude... Well, Orthodox! Burn that demon? - Burn! Burn! Burn, burn! And sho you do, Herods. Come on! Burn! Burn, burn! (whispers spell) (peal of thunder) (peal of thunder) (peal of thunder) This cloud will flood everything! Cossacks, are we going to do? - Hang him! - Hang him! About TSE Delo! Get the rope! (peal of thunder) - Dawn! - She's all right, Vakula. She's just insensitive. Raise! (bird chirping) (Lisa screams) Well, impure! Go to hell! (shot) (Cossack shouting) Stop lynching at once! Yakov Petrovich. The joy of meeting will leave for later, Nikolai Vasilyevich. Gentlemen, please. keep quiet and not to act afterwards, which you might regret. I fired one bullet. But inside this wonderful weapon 10 more. The reload speed for 3 seconds. And if you do not my request swear to, 10 of you will lie in the cemetery. Ah, and the rest, as rightly observed Mr. Binh, will be announced by the rebels and sent to Siberia. And here's my request. Get out, you fools! (Cossack groans) Ah, here is and now Hello, Nikolai Vasilyevich. Admit. You miss me? But how did you manage to survive in the house of Hanna? You know, I was worried all the time., that we're missing something. And I went into the house of Hanna in order to get some new evidence. And there he found the rider. And has entered with him in battle. Yakov Petrovich! I was wounded, but I survived. And when the fire started, the horseman disappeared. And I had an interesting thought. Because he thinks I'm dead. Therefore, it gives me a chance lay low and see, as if everything from the outside. And when did you send my stuff coach to St. Petersburg, Nikolai Vasilyevich, it was very touching. I stopped the carriage halfway and then issued the order the appointment of the investigator here. So you're all this time were you around? Well, let's just say nearby. And it never occurred to you to intervene? And you know that for the time being you, if I may say so, lay low, killed 9 girls, not to mention the fact, how many Cossacks died? If it were in my power, I would save every victim at the cost of his own life. But I had the right to do it. Gentlemen, I wasn't idle either. There are just things about which even you're not supposed to know. However, ladies and gentlemen, I watched very closely. the progress of your investigation. And I can say with confidence, that you are, of course, amazing fellows. I'm even sure you will rewarded for that. And now, I suppose, you have even, you even got Prime suspect. Yes. I'm pretty sure the rider is... count Danishevsky. And if we don't stop him, then... last victim... can be Lisa. But if he does kills only on holidays. Next is Cosmas and Damian. in 3 days. Accordingly, we have time to stop a murder and punish the bastard. You know, I've been studying materials for so long. about pagan holidays. Many of them are forgotten. But that doesn't mean they're not. What do you mean by that? Nearest forgotten holiday A heavenly night of Svarog". According to the legend in the night heavens punish earthly evil. When is tonight? Alas, today. Today? Horses, gentlemen. Three of us are going to the estate. Nikolai Vasilyevich, my dear, did you keep my chest? Naturally. But it's empty. We extracted everything from it. Oh, don't worry, Nikolai Vasilyevich. Rarely, but still it happens, that the inner is not the main thing. And why do you need a ring from the chest? And you know, it is possible that today you will have a chance to find out about it. Lisa? Lisa? Alexander Christofori? How are you? Uselessly. Be no one. Where are they? We were all over it. Maybe Danishevsky took her away. some secret place? No. In my vision was this mansion. So, where is it? What do you think they are, through land failed? (bird chirping) (click) Wow. Oksana? Who is this girl? You know her? - Do you see her too? In what way? What is happening? Lord. You shouldn't. Go away. - Count Danishevsky, in the name of the law... I'm ska... (shot) I never would have thought, that the rider can be just killing with one bullet. (coughs) It is warm. Living. Warm. I'm alive. Living.. (cries) Lisa? What a passage. Come true 12 Virgos and one resurrected. 12. 12. Plus 1. (ringing from the blows of swords) And remember, sister. You'll never defeat me. At least you're a girl now. The matchmakers aren't coming to you. What? You snake. Hey, grebes. What are you father not going out? We're on our way. (laugh) Bat, sorry for the delay. Probably waving again, huh? Long before sin. - Well, you taught us yourself. Adult girls, and behave Yak unreasonable lads. Maria, good news for you. I finally found you a fiancé. There he is. Mossiy Shilo from Chernigov. He's got a wife. died last year. Do me a favor, don't say no. Father, I don't. He's old. like Dido mail. You're fooling me, come on. Free Cossack, brave warrior. With wealth. He'll make a good husband. Back from the hike and the wedding is held on the right! Well, father? Don't argue. Not that the girls will disappear. Cossacks. Our little Russian farm ruins a gang of unholy poles. At the head of their lost soul, a thief and a killer, Casimir Mazowiecki! People are saying that he is a sorcerer. But it seems to me, all this... bullshit. Mr. Hetman sent me a decree, catch him alive Casimir! And then publicly execute the adversary for all crimes! And the poles it we ask of the pepper to they then not slipped to us no nose... No elbow! (all laugh) So, are the Cossacks? Go for a walk? Take a walk. Take a walk! I'm not going for that old fart. Better drown yourself. Yes full of the nonsense grind. I see nothing wrong with him. Easy for you to say, Liza. Don't you train with him after the wedding to sleep. She would have certainly followed the old did not. It seems to me that I am forever not getting married. From what? - Because I don't love anyone. Can't I? You snake. Me, means, can be without love, can't you? Wait a minute. - Ostap, what happened? - Broke us. Smashed clean. As smashed? Where's dad? Pan Daniel... and your fiancé... Mossiy Shilo, tried in the battle to capture cursed Kazimir Mazowiecki. Only he, in sight, truly a sorcerer. Neither bullet took it, nor a sword, nor an arrow. He cut Mosiah with the horse to pieces, and sir Daniel... his head was cut off and at the peak of her pinned. And then the poles and the fortress on the shore took. They won't be here tomorrow. So ticking away before it's too late. Did you hear what he said? Get ready quickly. We must leave. - We're not going anywhere. - God with you, how is it? Remember you said in the woods does the old recluse live? Well, lives. If not dead. Where to look? Feet are going to fall, just help us. Tell me if there is a way defeat this sorcerer? The sorcerer is immortal. The dark force his great. But there is one way to subdue him. Behold. If the neck of a sorcerer to put in this enchanted Hoop, he'll lose his strength at once. And while he's wearing that Hoop,, he's mortal. Hold on. It's a shitty thing you're up to. It's not a God. Revenge is for sinners. It will not bring you happiness. But all sorts of misfortunes on you it might. God will punish you three-post force. Give up before it's too late. Lisa. I don't understand? - How is it? How is that possible? - I needed to do that. To survive. Nicholas. That's nice. So in God. This Hoop is to tame all sorts of witches and witches. The only copy of its kind. I've hunted him for a long time. Even hope is lost. And then he suddenly accidentally discovered in a shop at the Kherson antiquarian. This moron had no idea., what he sells. Well, I had managed to get the box along with this Hoop literally half price. Nikolai Vasilyevich, what you do with such a person stand? Are you sorry? Believe me, if this lady turned into a horseman, she wouldn't spare anyone here. Oh! (Guro laughs) Take a look, gentlemen. Our young horsewoman, I think, has woken up. By the way can be and not that young. Excuse me, of course, for tactlessness, the sweetest Elizabeth Andreevna. And how many you founding full years? Let me guess? Somewhere under 180. - Am I wrong? - 180? How to understand this? Oh, there's plenty of Horatio's friend., what is unknown to our sages". Hamlet." Not read? There is no, here all -??? much it's cozier than a cave. Draught! Still thestudies sneezing will start. Or witches not sneeze? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, gentlemen. Bring the dead to the air. Not that one never knows will start to stink. Send someone immediately. to the village to bring our people. And I will need a crew to to deliver the prisoner to St. Petersburg. How? You want to take the criminal. But I dare you to recall, what am I supposed to interview and make a report on the whole form. I'm relieving you of this formality. I will interrogate the arrested person myself. But then I would be present during the survey. - I would, too. - I'd like to, gentlemen., I want you to follow my orders. Take out of the body, Alexander Christofori. And you, Nikolai Vasilyevich, as the youngest, run to the village for help. But Yakov Petrovich... - I said no. Daddy, Mr. Gogol is still alive? Alive, thank God. Mr. Guro saved him. Didn't my rain save him? You saw me calling for rain. and he came? I got through. Yeah, if I believed in miracles, I would., that this Vasilina all made. Whispered the spell and rain. My daughter... whispered a Holy prayer for salvation Nikolai Vasilyevich. She's not a witch at all. She's pure. And there is nothing the devil to drag us. Marushka says it's wrong you're scolding the doctor. Enough! Nothing to straw listen to! Vakula, what are you, really? Leave the child alone. Your daughter. Vasilina is not a witch. Come on, brother, let's have a drink. for the health of the fish. Come on. Come on, come on. (horses neigh) And how we get there to this demon Casimir? About him the rumor goes, that he's a terrible libertine. Well? And we will charoem his lovely prisoner. Good idea. And who will be the prisoner? You will. (we hear the Polish speech) (poles laughing) Stand. Who goes there? Prisoner for Mr. Casimir. I dare report. Brought a young girl for your entertainment. Nice lady. Attaboy. Receive the award. Already receive. You okay? It is necessary to tick away. May I have your permission? And that such service, you understand? Yesterday poppy-seed in his mouth was not. (laughs) Yes, you led us by the nose, Mrs. horsewoman, we've been moved. We really ashamed to think, that the murderer is your husband. Danishevsky was never my husband. He was my servant. 30 years ago, I started looking for someone., who could cook for me. special elixir, similarity of medication, that would help me at least for a while stay in human form, when it was my rock turn in black the rider. That person turned out to daniszewski. He was from an old Polish family. mortal wizards. When we met he was just a little boy. Love me. I couldn't. to return the favor. Then he begged me for permission., being around me. And serve me for the rest of my life. Well, I gotta hand it to him. He kept his word. - Sister, let's stop. - We'll get to those rocks and spend the night there. I guess when the poles find out, that Mazowiecki has perished, ahead without him our land will not come back. And we get to the farm and give it to the Cossacks, and they Hetman. And there is something this evil get what he deserves. What do you think they're doing to him? I think they are. And then quarter. The dog's death. Maria. Come quickly. It's going to get dark soon. (horses neigh) - Good night, beautiful. - Stop. Wait one word. There's nothing to talk about. You killed my father. He wanted to kill me and I killed him. You're a renegade. Don't talk to me about it. You know, I live 200 years. And all these wars, the struggle for power, I'm sick. I have understood that my salvation in repentance and love. If I had the chance, I would quit. I would live in a cave, I would have worn a hair shirt hard and all prayed the Lord would, to earn his forgiveness. And your love. Ah, means, you another fate awaits. My fate is in your hands. And as soon as my eyes saw you, so immediately clouded. And how I kissed you, so lips are still burning. I'm sinning, your truth. I've had a lot of women. But no beauty made me repent before God for her love. Do me a favor. Kiss me. I want to try it again. Before you commit yourself to eternal damnation. Sister. Go to sleep. I'll watch him myself. (crows CAW) Do not you think the behaviour Yakov Petrovich offensive? We are all made for this investigation. And we, like no other, have the right to be present during the interrogation. Nikolai Vasilyevich. Are you not interested? What are you getting at? There's gotta be a back door somewhere. Oh boy.... You drink. You know, Christine, why Lord they didn't take me with them? Not trust. I Christofori actually said. You said: "Good worker, a butcher's knife. Only you break a lot." And where I lie, hedgehog Kohl's is this really happening? Oh, how sickening. My heart hurts. And where is our Lord, in the middle of the night in such a darkness jumped? Villain to sarestoniemi count Danishevsky. He is the same rider is the murderer. Holy, Holy. Holy, Holy. So many people killed, she's such a damned bitch. Now zhinkov its lime wants Elizabeth Andreevna. And Lisa, for what? And she this, goes, 13-I victim. Only I know in advance, that it's all about jealousy. Because it nourishes the heart interest in Nikolai Vasilyevich. And Mr. Gogol feeds her these heart-felt feelings. Only about this TS-s, don't tell anyone. Okay. Enough with the countersinks. dumplings unmasked. It's time for you to go home. Ah? Where is Portobello? Lover mine? Come to me. May God have mercy on you. Free me. And see, as my soul will thank you. My love for you will never go away. Let us go, to the grave together. Take that Hoop off of me. (clanking of the sword) Stand. Don't do this, Maria. He'll fog your head, you fool. Yes, sister. You must be smarter than me. But I know how to love. I fight better. Think again. What I did in front of you so wrong? (cries) Lisa, don't take it personally. Don't betray me to the afterlife. Stop. You can't avoid the retribution of heaven! I'm Kara. You've got to be cursed forevermore! Doom you to eternal damnation And now you're immortal! But every 30 years, you have to bring the sacrifice of 12 virgins and resurrected one! And the deadline will be - "The night of Svarog, heavenly!" And if you don't do it, you'll die! And hell will break loose in your sight. And will your body to tear to pieces hyenas are fiery! Goodbye, Black witch! (laughs) (Lisa screams) (loudly shout) 12 plus 1. Don't you? You know, I'm very careful. studied the evidence of murder, who previously vouched in these places. And I couldn't understand your system. But finally one day... I understood. You just listen to me now, don't interrupt, okay? Don't let these be yours. horns grew. Now, 60 years ago you killed a dozen girls here. And the 13th victim was fat old butt. 30 years ago you again 12 girls were killed here. And the 13th victim was a young Cossack. And that's when I decided to inquire, what are these sacrifices for such the mysterious 13th? And, imagine, I did. The old priest's wife was generally a miracle here. One time at some wedding... she choked on a cherry bone. Wheezed, turned blue and fell dead on the ground. Everyone was absolutely sure, that she introduced herself. Then a little man jumped into her arms, rose, how did trahnul. A bone jumped out, the old woman came to life. And since then, she's been called resurrected. Only a short time. A month later, she went into the forest mushrooms and berries. That's where you stabbed her at the edge. In the ravine. You know better. You correct me, by the way., if I say something inaccurate. A similar story was and the young Cossack. He was lying in the hayloft. And lightning strikes it. Hit and killed. A quarter of an hour not breathing. Half an hour. And then unexpected way resurrects. Also not for long enjoyed this miracle because in 2 days it was found on the same the hay stabbed. I compared these two stories and thought. And suddenly and in this third time the rider need a resurrected one? That's why I brought here with me Mr. Gogol. I learned his story. He was born dead. Then you do not know, for what reason has come to life. So I decided to try to catch a live-bait rider, so to speak. That is, of Gogol. Just a strange way you are not caught. Why something revived this unhappy Mavka, then she was killed again. I still don't understand., why such difficulties? At first I thought it would be Nicholas. Then I ordered Alexey find me another victim. I couldn't. Wow! I mean, I'm sorry, you. In love? Surprised. Frankly, surprised. - Be enough. Do what you want to me. Take me to St. Petersburg. Let me be judged and executed there. While on my neck this Hoop it won't be difficult to hang me. Why are you rushing to the next world? I have no desire to give you up. so-called justice.

So, it seems, you don't have a choice. Lower the gun. You're right. I have no choice. (shot) Lisa! (breathing irregularly) You did what? Well, like you said. : "Business is business, honor is honor." No, you're not in prison. I'll take you to the yellow house for a rampant lunatic. - Hoop. - Lisa. Remove. I can't breathe. ...to 200 rods walked on your skin and tore her to hell! Then I'll rot in the dungeon alive! You stupid jerk! Gogol! (shot) Oh! (cries) Nikolai Vasilyevich. Listen to me. Just don't interrupt, please. I've never loved anyone. I thought I had no heart, and that it will last forever. Only when I met you., I have experienced what love is. (Bing moans, screams) I should have sacrificed you., but I didn't do that. (moans) But you sacrificed others. Lisa, you've killed a lot of people. - Innocent. - But I didn't choose this life. (moans) It's my curse. Who does not like you to understand me.

Now you'll see him die. Apparently they've been dead for 4 hours. What about my master? Then I'll go alone. You shouldn't go there. Oh, Liu, I won't let you go alone, Dona. Dona! (moans) (cries) Nikolai Vasilyevich? Nikolai Vasilyevich? Lisa, you must again become a horseman. Use your power. Or her... she kills you. No. I don't need my power for that. Forgive me for everything. I you... Wait, witch. Don't touch Mr. Gogol. Well, mind your own business. Go play with your dolls. (Mary screams) (Mary groans) Good job, Nikolai Vasilievich. Bravo.

Never made a deal with him. But people of honor leave, and evil remains unchallenged. It... lives and multiplies. And all that remains is for us... it is to trust in the judgment of God. When every man shall be rewarded for his works. I believe that it will be so. Otherwise, if you don't believe it... why should I live? Nikolai Vasilyevich. I you... - I'll never forget you. - Thank You. Take care of her, Vasilina, Vakula? God bless you all. I'm going to get my things. - Goodbye, Nikolai Vasilyevich. - Why farewell?
