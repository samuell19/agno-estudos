You know, I've realized lately that... I'm alone. I look around, all I want is... Just to be... all I want is to talk to a girl. And hopefully that can lead somewhere, like... A relationship? Some love, some affection, you know? Things that everybody wants. And yet... here I sit... all by myself. I just, I... I don't understand what it is. I see all you beautiful women walking around with boyfriends, holding peoples' hands. That's what I want, right. I feel that I am worthy of somebody else's love and affection. And yet, what I really feel like lately is that every... All you girls, and all you women are just... repulsed by me. And... And I don't know why that is. Right? Like... I'm... I'm pretty, like... I make myself attractive. I go to the gym. I take care of my place. You know, I'm not... I... I'm doing everything in my power to get you to notice me, and yet, every time I walk out, I feel like I'm walking around and I'm playing the part of the invisible man every day of my life because nobody fucking notices me. I know I'm worthy. I know I'm worthy of girls' love and affection. And yet, I... Somebody made a law and said I can't have that. So, I'm 28. And I'm a virgin. You don't want me to be lonely, do you? Is anyone online? As you can see, I'm already all ready for bed. Keep a girl company. I'm going to be up all night. Do you want to go chat in private? I'm feeling a bit lonely tonight, guys. Somebody come keep me company. Somebody with a sexy voice who can make me smile. You know who I'm talking about. Thank you. - Hi. - Thank god. Are you okay? What do you mean am I okay? I saw that video you made. What video? Your sister sent it to me and I just watched it. You weren't supposed to see that. You just seemed so lonely. I was very worried about you. Are you alright? What's going on there? - What are you... - What's happening? You weren't... You weren't supposed to see that, okay? It left me with a very bad feeling. - You sound nervous. - I thought you were happy. I know. I'm fine. You don't. You're not alone. If you have a problem, you can call me. We'll talk about it, and you can always come home. Don't do anything. Like, I don't... I don't want to talk about this. I don't want to talk about this right now. - You can talk to me. - No, because it's not... I'm fine. For every problem you have there's a solution. Hey, guys. I'm back. Did you miss me? What's going on in your life? - I have to go now, okay? - I'm very worried about you. I don't want you to worry. There's this girl coming by who I like. And, yeah, I really got to go. I got to go. - We love you. - Okay, bye. That's sweet and kind of you. What, not these clothes? You want these clothes off? Yeah? You can see a little more if, uh... We kick it, just me and you. So impatient. How patient am I? I'm not that patient. Come on. Somebody come play. That's always nice to hear. Okay. I need to remove somebody from this room, because he's not being very nice. Bye. Sorry, guys. There's always some weirdo that comes on here. I'm glad the rest of you are still with me. Come on. You're not going to make a girl wait all night, are you? That was very generous. Thank you, Mr. Darcy. I don't know if snuggling the cam works quite so well. I just turn into a blob. Come on. I thought you were gentlemen. Gentlemen don't keep a lady waiting all night. These clothes are getting so uncomfortable. Hey, guys. I'm going to run outside for a few minutes for my dirty bad girl habit. I'll be back soon. Let me guess. You want to bum a cigarette? Uh, sure. Yeah. If you don't mind, yeah, sure. I'm Jared... I'm Jared by the way. Do you have a lighter? Sorry, I just... All I have is my... So we meet again. Because I saw you in the laundry room before. Sorry about that by the way. I don't mean to, you know, weird you out or anything. So what are you up to tonight? I'm heading in as soon as this is done. Cool. How long have you, uh... I mean, I'm assuming you live in the building. Yeah, I live in the building. Um, six months. - I've been here six years. - Mm. So... I don't know. It's been alright. What are you, uh... doing these days? Um. I have to head in, but it was nice chatting with you. Yeah, likewise. Thanks for the cigarette again. See you. I have a private request, so I'll be back. Hello, Mr. Darcy. Are you there? Hi. Hi. I haven't met you before have I? What would you like me to do for you? I could take this tank top off for you. Is it okay if we just talk? Is this your first time? What do you want to talk about? So what should I call you? You can call me Ivy. Why don't you tell me about yourself? What do you look like? [Normal] What does normal look like? What color are your eyes? Green. I love green eyes. How long have you been doing this? Not long. I think you're really beautiful. Thank you. I like the way you smile. - Can you bring it in anymore? - Mm-hm. Yeah. Are you touching yourself right now, Mr. Darcy? It would turn me on if you were. I just want to talk. I wish you could keep smiling. Yeah? What do you look for in a guy? I like someone who makes me laugh. And someone who knows how to touch me. I want to touch you. I think my body would like to be caressed right now. Are you touching yourself right now? Want me to play, too? Can I show you a bit more? Yeah? Should I take this off? Where is your hand right now? Oops. Shouldn't have done that. Let's see. How much more should I show you? I just want to make you happy. Can we stop talking? Maybe a little more? Have a you seen a sock? It's got, like, half a cat face on it? Um. Hey, I owe you a cigarette. It's cool, but thanks. Do you have weed? So. I'm sorry about the other night. About being a bitch. You weren't. Oh, I was. I had a shitty day. I guess I took it out on you. Do you want to talk about it? You sound like my therapist. I was supposed to get a call back about a movie, and it never happened. So you're an actress? I've done a few shorts in a web series. I'm a filmmaker myself. Anything I've seen? No. Sorry. I am a bitch. You're not. Do you want to watch a movie? Dad. Wake up. Dad! My girl. Come on, get up. Why do you do this to yourself? That was beautiful. - Yeah? - Yeah. You're super fucked up. Thank you. For showing this to me. Your welcome. I mean, I... I wanted to show you. I should go. Where should I put this? Well, thanks. No problem. I mean, I was happy to smoke a little weed. We'll do it again soon. I'd like that. We should do it again soon. - I should, um... - Yeah. Are you... hungry? Do you like it here? I mean the city. Oh. Yeah, it's okay. Where are you from exactly? Um, D.C.. I'm from Montreal. What brought you here? - School. - Film school? Yeah. And that's what you wanna do? You want to make movies? Yeah. And what would you do if you couldn't? I don't mean that... I've never really thought about it. Even as a kid, I had all these self-imposed deadlines. You know, if I don't have an agent by 16, or my first feature by 21, I'd let it go and become a doctor, or something. I guess it's a bit late for that, huh? So tell me something. - Something. - Um. What's your longest relationship? I've never really had one. I know what you mean. Are you working on anything right now? Got some ideas here and there. I'm doing photography. Are you any good? I'm just screwing with you. Well, if you ever need a model, I'm pretty good. I'm going to hold you to that. Hello? Hey. I think you've got the wrong number. It's Jared. From upstairs? Oh, hey. So what's up? Not much. Uh, just wondering if you want to do the photography thing. Photography? 'Cause you mentioned before that you had done some modeling. Hello? Oh. Yeah, um... Yeah. When were you thinking? Um. - Now? - Um. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Can you give me an hour to get ready? Yeah. Okay, cool. I'll just text you when I'm ready, and then meet downstairs? - Okay. - Okay, cool. I'll see you soon. See ya. So what I asked you before. To think of your first memory. I just want to know what you were thinking about. My dad. I don't know if this is my first memory, but I was five or six. And I was home alone. My parents were both at work. My best friend Bonnie just got this new game Duck Hunt. So, um... Oh, I've played my fair share of Duck Hunt. Right? So I'm at her place. We're playing, so we're going good. Then my dad shows up and he's panicked. I guess he called the house, and when I didn't answer he freaked. And he, um... He left work. He just walked out and came to find me. I just remember being so mad at him. Because he messed up my playdate and couldn't play the game anymore. But I guess it's a pretty good memory. How so? I mean, he cared enough. Yeah. So you must be close with your dad then? Yeah, I was. Um, he passed away right before I moved here. Sorry, I didn't... It is what it is. I knew you were going to do that. Am I that obvious? Super-duper obvious. Hey. Are you cold? Please stop. Don't be like that. You have a boyfriend. So? So. You can't be mine. I don't belong to anyone. It's not like I'm married. Besides... True love triumphs in the end, right? Oh, god. I just want to love you. Hey. Hey. - It's me. - What's up? Uh, nothing. I just wanted to give you a call and let you know I got those photographs that we did. - I got them printed. - Oh, nice. So I can show them to you if you want. Yeah, for sure. I could come by and show them to you. Yeah. When do you want to come by? How about now? Um, my boyfriend's here right now, so tomorrow? Can you do around noon? Yeah. Yeah, let's do that then. Okay, see you then. Uh, yeah. See ya. That's really cool. - Yeah. - I had such a wave. That's super cool. That's amazing. Yeah. Can I get a copy of these? These are for you. - These are all for you. - Thank you. You're awesome. Have I told you that? I think my boyfriend will really love this one. Maybe I'll get a frame for him. What is it? Mom asked me to give you a call. Said she was worried about you. Oh. Look, I figured you weren't going to talk to me, so, I went ahead and booked a session with my life coach for you. And I really think this could be good for you. I'm kind of busy these days. Well, it's already been paid for. So it's up to you. You know, it's not good being a lone wolf all the time. Penny for your thoughts? - Sorry. - Don't be sorry. I'm just wondering what I can do to get all of your attention. Maybe if I took this bikini off? I just want you to be you. Why don't you tell me about your day? I spent some time with this girl. Do you like her? Why don't you tell me about her? I just feel that when I'm with her, that I never know what's going to happen next. Are you in love? Sounds like you're in love. Why don't you describe her? We like the same things. I think we're a good match, like, physically. Sounds like you're really feeling her. She's got a really nice smile. And when she smiles, I smile. And I like her hair. What color is her hair? Black. Like mine? You have a type, Mr. Darcy. She has a boyfriend. Are you sure I can't lose this bikini for you? I just want you to be you. Can you just be you? It's all I want. This is exactly what I've wanted to do and you said... None of my friends have to deal with this bullshit when it comes to their girlfriends. I'm trying to be supportive, but I don't fucking understand... You're trying to be supportive, but you want me to be an actor that has no kissing scenes, no love scenes. Do you know how fucking unrealistic that is? If you want to be a fucking actress, why can't you do, like, commercials, or something? I mean, there's money in that. I don't see you coming home with anything. I mean, you know, I helped you out with rent. I don't know what I can say that will help you to understand this. I want to be supportive. I don't want to shit on every single... Hey. Hey. Sorry about before. No, it's okay. Um, what's up? Can I come over? Now? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Are you okay? It's stupid. He's fucking stupid. I got that role. The one you helped me audition for. - That's great. - Yeah. And when I told him, he did this whole, like, Dr. Jekyll thing. You know. He actually had the nerve to say, "What if we had kids?" Just 'cause of the sex scenes. Obviously. I'm just so fucking tired. I think he's really stupid. Yeah. You're really great. See, why'd I just date someone like you? I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Takes a while to get to know each other this way. Yeah, but... I just wanted to be good for you. You're adorable. There's something I have to tell you. I should have told you. You can tell me. This was my first time. Yeah. I know. After we met, I looked you up. And I found... the video that you posted. I thought that was really sweet telling the world how ugly that you were a virgin. That takes some guts. And I felt how sad you were. And I get that. Do you forgive me for creeping? I played this scene before in my head so many times. I'm not going anywhere. I hate being alone. Maybe because you're alone. - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing here? I came to see you. I texted you last night. You didn't answer me, so I just wanted to check up on you. My phone died. Was there something you wanted to talk about? Um, do you want to grab breakfast? A quick talk over coffee. Now's not a great time. My boyfriend's here. - Is he leaving? - What? I saw you guys fighting last night. I just assumed then that you were in a fight of some sort... We fought and then we made up. Is that what you wanted to talk about? No. I, uh... I should go. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bug you. Um, I can do breakfast on... Um, Saturday? Yeah. Okay. I'll see you then, Yeah. Hey. What the fuck do you think you're doing? No. I'm talking to you. What the fuck do you think you're doing, man? I don't know what you're doing, man. What? Hey. Are you there? Let me in. It's just me. Open up. I'm so sorry about all this. We were fighting. Well, you saw us. And then you showed up in the morning and he started asking about you, and got all paranoid. Thought you liked me. I do like you. You "like, like" me? You know I have a boyfriend. You know that I love him? I do. Did you think something was going to happen here? I thought. How long have you thought this way? Since I saw you. Okay. Why don't I just date someone like you? I just want to make you happy. I just want you to like me. That's all. Did you think I'd leave him for you? Maybe. Get out of my head now, please. I was reciprocating friendliness, man. Nothing more. Can you just leave my head now? Oh, gone puppy dog on this whole thing. Over one scenario. Chemistry and connection. It's your own fault if you overthink it with me. I just want to love you. This isn't what I want. If you ever think about me, you might as well just put your head... Did you miss me? That's what I like to hear. No, of course, I miss you guys. It's what I look forward to. I had a very stressful day. So, yeah. You're like my bad little addiction. You're like my cigarette. Oh, we can talk about that in private. You're sweet. You want me to take this off? Don't you like it? Isn't it nice? Oh, we can talk about that if it's the two of us. Yeah? Of course. You know. You know, we don't we just go? The two of us can talk about that. Yeah? Will you wait for me just one minute? 'Kay. Don't go anywhere.
