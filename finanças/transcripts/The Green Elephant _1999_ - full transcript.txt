GREEN ELEPHANT Please get old folks, children and pregnant women away from the screen Come in! You called for me, comrade captain? - I did. - Two have been brought in. - Do I register them? - Register, as it is required. - I understand. - Then you can go. Listen...what time is it? do you know? Just approximately... - can't you sense it? - I asked what time it is... - Just a moment, wait. - Anyway, it's all the same, what time is it? I don't care what's going on there. - Then don't fucking talk. - Sit down. One can't do much sitting here. Here you can only stand and rest. Some bullshit...Stepan Razin... I don't give a fuck. Those drops don't do a fucking thing. Drops, drops... Sit down and give it a try. Sit the fuck down... I'll give it a try now. Earlier, when I was still in normal service, I did 20 push-ups every day... before dinner, I did 20 push-ups... Fuck, that's like some bird shitting, you know. I'll show you how I did push-ups. Look. At first I did them like this... one time, softly, and after that... Do you get it? And about 20 times like that before dinner. Then spirits appeared in our garrison, and I took about 200 grams before dinner... and then I stopped doing push-ups. You get on my fucking nerves! - Oh, well, why are you getting angry? - Being angry will dearly cost you, in here its just us two, understand? It fucking keeps dripping. We'll get watered down and that's all. We'll just get watered down, and that's all. You understand? Do you do push-ups yourself? I fucking do it! I see a buffalo. It would be good for you in the army. Being the boar that you are! And you? Aren't you a boar? Right. That's because I havn't done push-ups for half a year already. And I've become fat as a fucking meatball. Earlier I was...I'd get on the bar... hang there a little, stretch myself... and then I'd do a full circle on the first try and 20 more times like that. I'd jump down, stretch my arms calmly... Alright, I didn't want to. I can keep silent. If you don't want to listen to me. You're a tough guy, that's right. You have tough arms, legs. This problem worries me. I read a poem once, I don't fucking remember the poet's name. He wrote shit, that Ivan the Terrible went crazy, oh, fuck, Stepan Razin What's the fucking difference? Stepan the Terrible? Well, they kept dripping water on his head and he fucking lost it. And what's with him? - Went crazy. - That's Chinese torture. - Chinese, what's the difference? - Chinese, by the way, you know, I read, too. - I don't feel a fucking thing. - ...they have these seventy year old people, and they do special exercises every morning. They go out of their homes. They all live in villages...well, I was born ....in a village, too and they have this capital, I don't know, Shanghai or whatever. Then all the old people go outside, and they're poor, too, they have poverty just like us... and they do these special...exercises ...anyway, some kind of shit like that. Do you know about it? Respect, bro! It all depends on your breathing. You won't do a damn thing. You have to do it for twenty years... You're doing fucking great. Perhaps, you have no problems with chicks. - Stop talking fucking nonsense. - How does the saying go: as long as you have a hard-on... I have a hard-on, I have! Better sit down. - Alright, why are you so... - My character is...I have a calm character. I have a calm character. If I use this as a bar in the mornings I can break it and drown everything here. If we unscrew this shit... You're a tough guy and you'll get away, understand? But I will be sitting there on the fence. What fence? There's no fence. But what is there? - Cock knows what. Some kind of grid. You can't get out through there. There are wires and three phase current. - Touch it and you're fucked. - Mother said I would be ok, but father said I'd get fucked. Who would fuck? My father. But my mother, the bitch, said everything would turn out alright. And so we're, shit, sitting with you here like two fools, you understand? Don't want to talk, don't want to sleep... - I fucking want to drink. - Something. Even the piss dripping there. Have you tried to drink that water? I don't want a thing. Only when I remember something nice, my mood gets better. Your damn memories.... I remember one thing there or... well...I recall lot of things. At first I carried bricks. And there...there just... You know, when I recall something good... how I screwed a woman for the first time. In my village. And how was it? Fuck. If I tell you now, you'll have a boner, and then we'll be...shit, doing... Who will have a boner? - You? Won't you have a boner? - Should I get a hard-on from your stories? - We sit here together... - Oh, go on, tell. Well, I drank three "sevens", a bottle, with some dummy... ...and then we fucked. Fucking story, I have such a boner... now I'll be fucking the walls. You just screwed? It was a quicky, we fucked for only ten minutes. And then I came, there was so much cum... Lots of cum when I simply fuck... - That's a fucking story you have there! - Oh, well, now you'll be laughing all the time... I won't. Tell me how you fucked... Then I remember Berday...there's a sea, kinda Black Sea, Azov Sea maybe, I don't remember anything. There I took a shit. I went naked in the sea and took a shit. I was also drunk. Again three "sevens". Always three "sevens", you understand? Yeah, I fucked one time, that was fucking good... I know, chicks like guys like you. I, too, wanted to be tough, mother believed in me, she took me to see boxing. When they fucking hit me, imagine... mommy, that's the end of that, I'm sorry. Father then hit me some more at home. - Try to hit me. - You're dextrous. - Go on. - Wait a moment. Well? - Fucking nothing. - Now it will be ??? Well, how was it? - I don't give a shit. - Look, I'll do it like this with my hands...well? No, like an imbecile... I'll drink it, I can't fucking stand it anymore. We were saying something about the Chinese... Shit, some kind of piss. Yeah, that's seweage. What the hell's that, anyways? Perhaps, we should make playing cards? We'll draw them. Fuck, there's no paper. I don't understand what is with you. - Sit still. - Well, look, we can make squares on board with a nail...and from dirt we'll make checkers. I think you're out of your fucking mind and not me, you're fucking crazy. Look, I just thought we can make black ones from dirt, white ones we can make from dirt, too, and I will just shred cigarette papers in small pieces and put them on top of this dirt. Then we will....so that we wouldn't be completely bored we will play checkers and bet. Well, I don't know, for example...??? Are you a faggot? - What? - Are you a faggot? Whats a faggot? Are you gay? Fuck no. Some guys thought I was gay, they even beat the shit out of me once... then, I think...my father told me: the most important thing is not to be called gay because if you're called that once you'll have that nickname forever. And that's worst of all. And that guy who beat shit out of me... I shat in his shoes. That motherfucker put his shoe on in the morning and his foot was all covered in shit. But he immediately understood that it was me. Are you gonna shit in my things while I sleep because I called you gay? No. - Thanks. - We're the only two here. You'll know at once that it was me. I will fucking know, and I will fucking hit you right away. Anyway, when I shat in his shoe, them bitches were all asleep they had to notice the shit, clean the shoe... but I shit and went to sleep at once...so... but those motherfuckers undressed me when they realized...and there were still pieces of shit on my ass and shit from shoe stank the same as the shit on my ass. And they all wanted to fuck me I woke up at once...I don't even know what they found in me, I was all screaming, and they said: "to hell with him", understand? They smeared me with shit and made me eat a bit of it. After that I was transfered to another division... that happened when I was still in quick response unit. And how was the shit? Tasty? Shit...was so so, you know, like earth. - I wouldn't think that. - Swine eat their shit, and they...their hearts are even transplanted into man. Did you enjoy the shit? Well, understand...they fucking beat me, I had such a mood then... From the way you're telling it, I get the impression you enjoyed the shit. ????? Well, alright, what's with you... If you're, as you say, fed up with me, I would simply walk away but we're sitting here...sitting two of us... What a dumbass you are, bitch! We're sitting here...two of us... Could you shut the fuck up and just sit without saying a goddamn thing? You can smoke it till the end if you want. Why are you so mad? If I wanted to smoke I'd ask you "give me fucking cigarette". I don't want to smoke, I want you to shut up. Mother just sent me this package... What have I to do with your mother, for fucks sake! What have I to do with your cigarettes! Could you just fucking shut up! Why are you such an angry man? Guys, just be people... I'm always telling you that. Why do you always start... I don't start a fucking thing! I want nothing from you. I want you to shut up. That's all. I'm fucking fed up with your stories, I can't hear them anymore. One story is fucking stupider than other. About shit, about cum... what are you babbling? You will have a fucking boner... some fucking bullshit. Listen, if you want I'll tell you something else, something good... like how I'm doing my push-ups? Listen, I can do push-ups once more. Go on. Start doing it. Do your fucking push-ups. Only don't hit me in the ass... I won't, I'll just watch and receive fucking pleasure. It's better not to lift up ass when you're doing push-ups...

Be people, guys, we're all...we're all people. - You're crazy, completely crazy. - Your roof has gone off, you understand? ????? or what are you gonna do? What story are you gonna tell me now? - We agreed on checkers... - What checkers? We will play checkers. Everytime you lose, I'll fucking hit you. You... What "you"? Who "you"? We're only two here. I'm one and you. What fucking checkers? What the fuck are talking about? On what were you gonna play checkers? What fucking push-ups are you doing? Do you understand you're crazy?

Just shut the hell up! Or can't you? Do you know how your making me feel? I'm losing my mind because of you. Not because I'm here, but because of you, bitch. - Alright, be people... - Who are "we"?! Who are you talking to? I'm the only fucking one here! Who's people? I'm not a man anymore, I'm a fucking beast. Why are you shouting all the time? Who is this "we", for motherfuckings sake!

Fucking big, it looked like a ???, I went to the fucking hospital, but instead of that they fucking cut my leg off, fucking great story, isn't it? I had an incident once... And then they sewed it back on. Guys taught me...if you're going into hospital... Wait, don't you give a fuck that I'm shouting at you, that I could beat the shit out of you? You simply don't give a fuck, do you? - Why are you so angry people... - Who's "you angry"? Who's "you"? Count me who do you see here. Fucking lunatic! Here-a we are two, right? Here-a! Who taught you to talk like that "here-a"? HERE, shit! You're serving in army. You have to talk fucking correct. You're military man, don't fucking disgrace the shoulder-straps. What the fuck is that? They ripped my straps off, but left his. Fucking nice. Fuck. Give it here, bitch, otherwise I'll beat the shit out of you. Why did you throw the shoulder-strap on the floor? Shit, you're standing in line for the firing squad not shoulder-straps! They will be swearing at me afterwards... Lieutenant. You're faggot, not a lieutenant, bitch. - Why did you rip off my shoulder-strap? - Shoulder-strap, what shoulder-strap? Shoulder-straps, there's two of them, I riped off fucking two of them. You're a good guy... I am good guy but you're a fucking awesome guy... Jolly, bitch... - And how fucking jolly you are! I'm simply...

Understand? Listen, I'll sing you something, will I? This is a song about the circus. It's called "Green Elephant". I'll sing it now because when you were taken away I composed it. So, first part goes like this: Our green elephant has arrived at the orchestra, our green elephant has brought a trumpet with him When guys were walking away the green elephant played on the trumpet. Played...just a moment, wait. I'll remember in a moment. Played about how bad it is to live in a cage how bad it is to eat. How bad it is to eat damn food how bad everybody feels, but the green elphant feels worse. So the song goes. I just wanted to sing you this song... No, simply I see... Enough. Let's sleep.

Shut your trap! So, the Japanese before World War II to be exact, Admiral Yamamoto decided to fuck up the American fleet at the Hawaian islands. Afterwards it went into history as the Pearl Harbour catastrophe. Listen and keep it in mind. The commanding officer of the air raid on Pearharbour was Admiral Naguma. A middle officier in fact...that is, an acting officer, a proffesional, but without any imagination. Japanese in general have never had many people with imagination...

First air charge consisted of 50 pursuit planes from Soriu, 40 torpedo carriers and 81 bombers. As a result of this air charge four battleships of the American fleet were sunk. What ships were those? What ships! Arizona, West Virginia, Oklahoma and Maryland. You have to know this! If you studied in sixth grade school. That's fucking classics! Pursuit planes, bitch!
