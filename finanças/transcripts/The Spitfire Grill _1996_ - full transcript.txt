GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. [BELL JINGLES] [OWL HOOTING] [HOOTING CONTINUES] [PERCY WHISPERING] WAIT! WAIT! [PANTING] I DON'T MEAN YOU NO HARM. I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN THE BAG FOR A CHANGE. THAT'S ALL. I KNOW WHAT'S IT LIKE EATIN' THE SAME THING EVERY DAY... TILL YOU CAN'T HARDLY STAND THE SIGHT OF IT NO MORE. WOULD YOU LIKE THAT MAYBE? SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN THE BAG NEXT TIME? OKAY THEN, IT'S A DEAL. WE'LL TRY SOMETHING NEW. MAYBE NEXT TIME, WE WON'T BE SO RUSHED. WE'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO CHAT. THAT WOULD BE OKAY, WOULDN'T IT? WELL, IT'S LATE, SO I'LL BE GETTIN' BACK. [RUSTLING] [DISHES CLATTERING, WOMEN TALKING] HI, MOM. [SHELBY] HI, SWEETHEART. YOU'RE RIGHT ON TIME. TAKE A LOOK OVER THAT. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE. YEAH. [SHELBY] WHAT YOU GOT FOR ME TODAY? HI. NO LACK OF ODD DUCKS AROUND HERE, IS THERE? YOU CAN SAY THAT TWICE AND MEAN IT. [LAUGHS] PUT YOUR NAPKIN IN YOUR LAP. SHELBY, THE "FOR SALE" SIGN IN THE WINDOW, IS HANNAH REALLY SELLIN' THIS PLACE? DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG? MEET ME ON THE BACK PORCH. WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME MORE POTATOES FOR SUPPER. SORRY. I SHOULDN'T BE SO NOSY. OH, NO. IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S JUST-- [SIGHS] I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S RIGHT FOR ME TO SAY. BUT I CAN'T SEE HOW IT'S WRONG, EITHER. YOU SEE... [SIGHS] HANNAH HAD A SON. ELI. RIGHT FROM THE FIRST IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR HE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL. TALL, STRONG, SWEET. [GIGGLES] ALL-STATE CHAMP 4 YEARS RUNNIN'. SOMEHOW IT JUST SEEMED LIKE ELI BROUGHT OUT THE BEST IN THIS TOWN, LIKE, AS LONG AS HE WAS HERE, SOMEHOW EVERYTHING WOULD TURN OUT ALL RIGHT. AND THEN THE WAR IN VIETNAM CAME. DID HE GET DRAFTED? OH, NO, NO. HE ENLISTED. HIS DAD, JAMES, HAD BEEN A BIG HERO IN WORLD WAR II. I GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY NAMED THIS PLACE THE SPITFIRE. SO WHEN IT CAME ELI'S TURN TO SERVE, HE WAS RARIN' TO GO. I CAN STILL REMEMBER WALKIN' UP THE HILL TO THE BUS STOP... WITH THE WHOLE TOWN TO SEE HIM OFF. THAT WAS THE LAST TIME WE EVER SAW ELI. HANNAH NEVER TOLD ME WHAT THE OFFICIAL STORY WAS, BUT AFTER A FEW YEARS, IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR... HE WASN'T COMIN' BACK. HIS DAD JAMES TOOK IT REAL HARD. I GUESS HIS HEART JUST GAVE OUT FROM IT. A COUPLE YEARS AFTER JAMES DIED, HANNAH PUT THE GRILL UP FOR SALE... AND ASKED NAHUM TO SEE IF HE COULDN'T FIND A BUYER. THAT WAS ALMOST 10 YEARS AGO. YOU KNOW, IF HANNAH STILL REALLY WANTS TO SELL THIS PLACE, SHE MIGHT COULD TRY RUNNING ONE OF THEM ESSAY CONTESTS. CONTESTS? WHEN I WAS WORKING AT THE TOURIST OFFICE, THERE WAS THIS BIG FUSS ABOUT SOME FOLKS DOWN IN CENTER LOVELL WHO HAD AN INN THEY COULDN'T SELL. SO THEY RAN AN ESSAY CONTEST TO RAFFLE IT OFF. COME OUT WITH A FAIR PIECE MORE THAN THEY EVER COULD HAVE SOLD THAT PLACE FOR. SOUNDS CRAZY, HUH? [HANNAH] PERCY. PERCY! [RINGING] WHAT'S WRONG? WE MUST BE RUNNIN' WELL SHORT OF SUPPLIES BY NOW. SUPPLIES? DAMN, FROM THE SOUND OF IT, I THOUGHT YOUR HAIR WAS ON FIRE OR SOMETHING! WELL, IT AIN'T. NOW, I WANT YOU TO DRIVE DOWN TO THE DISCOUNT MART IN BETHEL. I GOT A LIST ALL MADE OUT FOR YOU HERE. YOU CAN DRIVE, CAN'T YOU? WELL, I'VE DRIVEN SOME. BUT YOU WANT ME TO GO? WELL, IT'S WARMIN' UP A LITTLE. I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD USE THE FRESH AIR. BESIDES, THE WAY YOUR COOKING'S IMPROVED, I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME WE GIVE SHELBY A TURN IN THE KITCHEN, DON'T YOU? I'M SURE SHE'D WELCOME THE CHANCE. HERE'S THE LIST. THERE'S $300 HERE IN THE DRAWER... AND THE KEY TO THE TRUCK. YOU WON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE FINDIN' YOUR WAY BACK, WILL YOU? NO, MA'AM. ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK, GLACIER? HEY, MISTER, YOU ALL RIGHT OVER THERE? HEY, WHAT Y'ALL DOIN'? [MAN] NOTHIN'. Y'ALL FROM OHIO? 'CAUSE I'M FROM OHIO. I'M FROM AKRON. [DOOR SHUTS, ENGINE STARTS] [SIGHS] IS IT STARTIN' TO ACHE BAD AGAIN NOW, HANNAH? NO, NOT AS MUCH AS TRYIN' TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PART OF ME IS GONNA GIVE OUT NEXT. OH, HANNAH, DON'T. SPARE ME YOUR MILKSOP, SHELBY. IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF "IF" ANYMORE. IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF "WHEN." IT'S HIGH TIME NAHUM GOT ON THE STICK AND FOUND ME A BUYER FOR THIS PLACE. YOU CAN TELL HIM I SAID SO, TOO. OH, I'LL TELL HIM, HANNAH. BUT WITH THE REAL ESTATE MARKET BEING LIKE IT IS-- I DON'T KNOW. YOU MIGHT-- MIGHT WHAT? YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY ONE OF THOSE ESSAY CONTEST THINGS TO RAFFLE IT OFF. SOME FOLKS IN CENTER LOVELL CAME OUT REAL WELL FROM DOING IT WITH AN INN THEY HAD. ESSAY CONTEST? WHAT KIND OF NONSENSE IS THAT? NOTHIN'. I WAS JUST TALKIN'. SO...HOW WOULD ONE OF THEM ESSAY CONTEST THINGS WORK ANYWAY? YOU MEAN LIKE THE ONE IN CENTER LOVELL? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE THE ONE THAT BROUGHT IT UP. WELL, THE WAY I HEARD IT, FIRST, THEY SET A DEADLINE 3 OR 4 MONTHS FROM THE START. THEN THEY ASKED PEOPLE TO SEND $100 OR SO WITH AN ESSAY SAYIN' WHY THEY WANTED THEIR INN. THEY PROMISED IF THEY GOT AT LEAST 2,500 ESSAYS BY THE TIME THE DEADLINE ROLLED AROUND, THEN THEY'D PICK THE ESSAY THEY LIKED BEST AND GIVE THE INN TO WHOEVER WROTE IT. AND THEY GOT THAT MANY? EVEN MORE, I THINK. THAT WOULD BE MORE THAN $250,000, WOULDN'T IT? THIS IS ALL LEGAL? IT MUST BE IF THEY DID IT ALREADY. [POT LID RATTLING] SHELBY, SEE TO THAT POT. IT'S ABOUT TO BOIL OVER. PERCY...WHY DON'T YOU GO ON UP TO BED? SHELBY AND I WILL FINISH UP HERE. GOOD NIGHT THEN. [HANNAH] GOOD NIGHT. DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG? WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK OF THIS CONTEST IDEA? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE YOU BETTER ASK NAHUM. WHEN I WANT NAHUM'S OPINION, I'LL ASK HIM. RIGHT NOW I'M ASKIN' YOU. YOU STILL GOT A MIND, DON'T YA? YES, HANNAH, I DO. WELL, THEN? WELL, THEN, I CAN'T SEE THAT... YOU STAND TO LOSE ANYTHING BY TRYIN'. [SIGHS] THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKIN', TOO. OF COURSE, I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THERE'S 50 PEOPLE WOULD WANT THIS PLACE, LET ALONE 1,000 OR MORE. BUT I SUPPOSE ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD... SEE TO ALL THE DETAILS OF IT FOR ME? I DON'T KNOW. YES OR NO, SHELBY? YES. ALL RIGHT. THEN IT'S SETTLED. BUT YOU MAKE SURE THEY KNOW IT'S FOR CASH ONLY! I DON'T WANT TO BE FOOLIN' WITH OUT-OF-STATE CHECKS. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. "SMALL DINER THAT SEATS ABOUT 40, WITH HOUSE ATTACHED." HOW DOES THAT SOUND? AWFUL, HUH? IT'S OKAY, I GUESS. BUT IF I WAS GONNA GAMBLE $100, I'D WANT IT TO BE FOR SOMEPLACE, YOU KNOW, SPECIAL. IT'S NOT JUST THE SPITFIRE THEY'D BE GETTIN'. THEY'D BE GETTIN' GILEAD, TOO. WELL, THERE'S NOTHING VERY SPECIAL ABOUT GILEAD THAT I CAN SEE. MAYBE NOT. YOU COULD SAY THERE'S ENOUGH COUNTRY AROUND IT TO LOSE YOURSELF IN... AND NOT SO MANY PEOPLE YOU'D EVER FEEL LOST. OH, I DON'T KNOW. NO, NO, I LIKE THAT. KEEP GOING. WHAT ELSE? YOU COULD SAY... IT'S A PLACE WITH ROOTS SO DEEP NOBODY COULD TEAR 'EM OUT FROM UNDER YOU. AND CUSTOMERS SO LOYAL THEY'LL KEEP COMIN' BACK EVEN IF YOUR COOKIN' STINKS. [LAUGHING] LOYAL CUSTOMERS. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE? NAHUM TOLD ME WE GOT MORE PEGMATITE ROCK FORMATIONS... THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY. DID HE NOW? BUT WE CAN'T PUT THAT. OH, I KNOW. WHY DON'T WE WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT THE INDIAN RIVER? THEY'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF HISTORY THERE. YEAH. MAINE TOURIST OFFICE. CAN I HELP YOU? JOLENE? HEY, IT'S PERCY. [JOLENE] PERCY? I GOT PERCY! HOW YOU DOIN', GIRL? I'M ALL RIGHT. LISTEN, JOLENE, YOU REMEMBER THAT ESSAY CONTEST THING WE HAD ALL THEM CALLS ABOUT A WHILE BACK? YEAH. THE WOMAN WHO OWNS THE DINER I WROTE YOU ABOUT, SHE WANTS TO TRY ONE. I WAS HOPIN' YOU AND THE OTHER GIRLS COULD HELP ME OUT... BY CALLIN' SOME OF THE PAPERS, HELP ME GET THE WORD OUT. HEY, YOU JUST TELL ME HOW YOU WANT IT TO READ, AND I'LL MAKE IT MY BUSINESS THAT BY THIS TIME NEXT MONTH, WHOLE DAMN COUNTRY'S HEARD ABOUT IT. HOW'S THAT? [LAUGHS] BLESS YOU, JOLENE. OKAY, YOU GOT A PEN? I WANT YOU TO WRITE THIS DOWN. WE WANT ALL THE ENTRIES TO GO TO HANNAH FERGUSON, CARE OF THE SPITFIRE GRILL. THAT'S IN GILEAD, MAINE-- [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [JOE] HEY. HI. HI. HANNAH SAID YOU WAS OUT FOR A WALK. [SNIFFS] YEAH. TRYIN' TO GET A LITTLE PEACE... BEFORE THE DISHES GET TO RATTLIN' IN MY HEAD. OH, YEAH. YOU LIKE THE WOODS, DO YOU? MY MAMA SAID MY PEOPLE COME FROM THE MOUNTAINS. CLOSEST I EVER BEEN WAS A CITY PARK IN AKRON. YOU ARE FROM OHIO. YEAH, WHEN THE COAL MINES IN KENTUCKY GAVE OUT, MY PEOPLE WENT NORTH LOOKIN' FOR WORK. DIDN'T DO MUCH GOOD. WE STILL JUST POOR WHITE TRASH UP THERE TOO. HAD US OUR VERY OWN SLUM AND EVERYTHING. I MAY TALK COUNTRY, BUT THE ONLY HILLS I EVER SEEN HAVE BEEN IN MAGAZINES. YOU OUGHT TO TAKE A RIDE OUT TO MY LAND SOMETIME. WE GOT TREES OUT THERE AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE. YEAH? OH, YEAH. YEAH. [SHELBY] PERCY! WHAT? COME QUICK. SOMETHING'S HAPPENED. WHERE ARE YOU PULLIN' ME? I GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YA, AND I WANTED SOMEPLACE EXTRA PRIVATE. WHAT? IN HERE? DON'T WORRY. NOBODY COMES HERE ANYMORE. SINCE THE QUARRY CLOSED, WE GOT NO MONEY FOR A MINISTER. IF YOU WANT TO GO TO CHURCH, YOU GOTTA DRIVE AT LEAST TO BETHEL. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT COMES NOW. WHY? OH, FOR SOMEPLACE WHEN... I NEED TO BE BY MYSELF WHERE... IT'S QUIET. I NEVER TOLD ANYONE ABOUT THIS BEFORE, BUT I WON'T MIND IF YOU WANT TO COME HERE... SOMETIMES BY YOURSELF, TOO. SO WHAT'S THIS GOOD NEWS YOU GOT? LOOK.

BUT IT'S A SHAME THAT'S ALL THEY ARE. ABOUT 80 YEARS AGO, BEFORE ANYONE KNEW ANY BETTER, THEY CLEAR-CUT THROUGH HERE, TOOK DOWN EVERYTHING. THIS IS THE STUFF YOU GET BACK. IT'S NO GOOD FOR LUMBER. IT'S NOT EVEN GOOD ENOUGH TO PULP FOR PAPER. THIS IS ALL JUST WORTHLESS. I DON'T KNOW NOTHIN' ABOUT TREES, BUT, IF THEY WAS MINE, YOU COULDN'T DRAG ME AWAY WITH A RUNAWAY TRAIN, NO MATTER HOW WORTHLESS PEOPLE SAID IT WAS. [SIGHS] YOU JUST ROLL IT OUT GENTLE. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU CAN PUT SOME MORE FLOUR ON THE PIN IF YOU NEED TO. [SIGHS] CUT THE BUTTER IN JUST TO PEA SIZE. LET THE MILK SIT BEFORE YOU START. TAKE THE EGGS OUT FIRST-- YOU KNOW I'M NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THIS ON MY OWN, DON'T YOU? OH, YOU WILL TOO.

[SIGHING] WHEN I WAS READIN' UP ON THIS STATE, I COME ACROSS THIS STORY, YOU KNOW. THERE WAS THIS INDIAN SQUAW, AND SHE WAS ROWIN' A CANOE WITH HER BABY IN IT. A COUPLE SAILORS WHO WERE LIQUORED-UP CAUGHT SIGHT OF 'EM ON THE RIVER. [SIGHS, LIGHTS MATCH] THEY'D HEARD THIS STORY THAT, UH, INDIAN BABIES KNEW HOW TO SWIM FROM BIRTH, SO THEY DECIDED TO TEST THEIR THEORY OUT. THEY CAPSIZED THE CANOE. AND THE BABY WENT STRAIGHT TO THE BOTTOM. THE STORY DIDN'T SAY WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MOTHER. BUT I FIGURE IT'S PROBABLY BEST IF SHE JUST... DROWNED, TOO. DON'T YOU THINK? [SIGHS] I FORGOT, HANNAH DOESN'T WANT ME SMOKIN' IN THE KITCHEN. PERCY. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [SIGHS] I GUESS YOU GOT THAT FOOD ALL RIGHT. SHELBY SURE CAN WORK MAGIC WITH FLOUR AND BUTTER, CAN'T SHE?

MAYBE IT WEREN'T EVER MEANT FOR ME TO HAVE ONE. WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU GOT A NAME? MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE A REAL NAME, EITHER. STILL, IT WOULD BE NICE TO CALL YOU SOMETHIN'. HEY, THE INDIANS HAD A STORY ABOUT A MAGIC GIANT, LIVED IN THE WOODS. CALLED HIM GLUSKAP, 'CAUSE HE LOOKED OUT FOR 'EM. WOULD THAT BE A GOOD NAME FOR YOU? I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE WANTIN' TO BE CALLED GLUSKAP. HOW ABOUT JOHNNY B.? HOW'D THAT BE FOR A NAME? JOHNNY B. NEVER KNEW WHAT HIT HIM.

[GASPS] $100. [SHELBY, PERCY LAUGH QUIETLY] "DEAR MRS. FERGUSON, "I SAW THE ARTICLE ABOUT YOUR CONTEST LAST NIGHT "WHEN I COULDN'T SLEEP. "I WAS SICK OF WATCHING TV, SO I PICKED UP THE PAPER. "THE REASON I CAN'T SLEEP "IS BECAUSE MY FAMILY IS FALLING APART. "MY WIFE WALKED OUT LAST YEAR... "AND LEFT ME WITH OUR 2 HIGH SCHOOL BOYS. "I DON'T THINK HER LEAVING US WAS ALL MY FAULT, "BUT THEY BLAME ME FOR IT ANYWAY. "THE WAY THEY'RE ACTING NOW, "I'M AFRAID IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING SOON, "THEY MAY LEAVE ME, TOO. "MAYBE IF I COULD TAKE US ALL OFF "TO SOMEPLACE LIKE YOURS IN GILEAD, THAT WON'T HAPPEN." [GROANS] [SIGHS] IF THEY'RE ALL GONNA SOUND LIKE THAT, THEN TO HELL WITH IT. IT'S JUST THE FIRST ONE. MIGHT WORK BETTER IF YOU LET ME DO IT. I SUPPOSE IT MIGHT. [SIGHS] HERE. JUST DON'T PRESS TOO HARD. [GROANS, SIGHS] STILL PRETTY TENDER IN THERE, HUH? SORE ENOUGH, SEEING AS HOW THE DOCTOR KEEPS TELLIN' ME HOW WELL I'M HEALIN'. DO YOU SUPPOSE IF A WOUND GOES REAL DEEP, THE HEALIN' OF IT CAN HURT ALMOST AS BAD AS WHAT CAUSED IT? MIGHT BE. [BELL JINGLING] DETROIT. NEW YORK. KANSAS CITY. BOSTON. MEMPHIS. NOW, AS POSTMISTRESS, I'VE GOT A LEGAL RIGHT TO KNOW IF THE MAIL SERVICE IS BEING USED FOR ANY IRREGULAR PURPOSE. SO ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME WHAT GOES ON HERE, HANNAH, OR DO I HAVE TO OPEN THESE MYSELF? WELL, NOT THAT IT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS, EFFY, BUT I'M RUNNIN' A CONTEST TO GIVE AWAY THE GRILL. A CONTEST? WHAT KIND OF CONTEST IS THAT? SOME KIND OF ESSAY THING. YOU KNOW HANNAH. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE COULD BE UP TO. SOMETHING ABOUT AN ESSAY OR SOMETHING. $100 AND A LETTER. WHY WOULD YOU EVEN WANT TO TRY SUCH A THING, HANNAH? 'CAUSE NO ONE ELSE WAS BUYIN'. WHERE WOULD MY AUNT HANNAH GET AN IDEA LIKE THAT? FROM ME. IS THAT RIGHT? [CHUCKLES] I JUST HOPE THIS FINALLY MAKES... AN OLD SOUR APPLE LIKE YOU HAPPY, HANNAH FERGUSON! HOLY MOSES. [BELL JINGLES] HOLY MACKEREL. HOLY SHIT. [LAUGHING] "AND I BELIEVE IN TIME... "I CAN EXPAND THE SPITFIRE... INTO A NATIONAL CHAIN OF RESTAURANTS." [PERCY] WAIT. LISTEN TO THIS ONE. "THE REASON I NEED TO HAVE YOUR DINER... "IS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE ALIENS TOLD ME "TO WAIT FOR THEM UNTIL THEIR SHIP COMES TO TAKE ME TO--" [GARBLING] I CAN'T EVEN READ THAT WORD, BUT I'M GUESSIN' IT'S ANOTHER PLANET. WE'RE GONNA SEND THAT ONE BACK TOMORROW. YOU READ ONE, HANNAH. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE. "DEAR HANNAH, "I'VE WORKED AS A COOK ALL MY LIFE, "BUT HARD AS MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE WORKED, "WE'VE NEVER HAD MORE THAN 2 NICKELS TO RUB TOGETHER. "WE TALKED ABOUT HAVING OUR OWN LITTLE PLACE SOMEDAY, BUT THAT DON'T PUT BREAD ON THE TABLE." WELL, THAT'S FOR SURE. "BUT NOW MY HUSBAND'S... PRETTY SICK. "THE DOCTORS SAY "THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE THAT THEY CAN DO FOR HIM. "I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF DESERVING PEOPLE OUT THERE. "BUT IT WOULD BE A TRUE BLESSING IF MY HUSBAND... "COULD SPEND WHAT'S LEFT OF HIS DAYS... "IN A PLACE LIKE GILEAD, "AND I COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO SUSTAIN ME WHEN HE'S GONE." HMM. MAYBE YOU SHOULD HOLD ONTO THAT ONE. YEAH. BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE SHOULD PICK SOMEONE OUT OF PITY. WELL, WHAT SORT OF PERSON WOULD YOU WANT IN HERE, HANNAH? I DON'T KNOW. BUT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE SOMEONE YOUNGER. SOMEONE MORE YOUR AGE THAN MINE. YEAH? 'CAUSE I ALWAYS FIGURED IT WOULD BE SOMEBODY LIKE YOU. [SCOFFS, LAUGHS] [SHELBY] ME, TOO. [LAUGHING] WELL... WHOEVER GETS IT... IS GONNA HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR 'EM... TRYIN' TO RUN THIS PLACE WITHOUT YOU TWO. HANNAH, HAVE YOU BEEN THINKIN' WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO WITH ALL THIS MONEY NOW? HMM. I'VE BEEN THINKIN' ABOUT THAT SINCE THE DAY I FIRST PUT THE GRILL UP FOR SALE. ALMOST GAVE UP HOPE... BUT NOW-- WHERE'S THAT JUG? THAT APPLEJACK AIN'T DOIN' US ANY GOOD IN THE BOTTLE. OH, WELL, MAYBE JUST HALF A GLASS...MORE. [ALL GIGGLING] "IF I WERE ONLY ONE INCH TALL, "I'D SLEEP IN A SLIPPER IN THE HALL... AND DREAM ALL NIGHT OF BEING TALL." I'M BACK. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. AND IT'S BEDTIME FOR YOU, SWEETS. YOU GO ON UPSTAIRS. I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE. OKAY. [SIGHS] HMM. [GIGGLES] HMM, LOOKS LIKE THAT CONTEST TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT. YOU MUST BE REAL PROUD. OH, I'M JUST GLAD FOR HANNAH, THAT'S ALL. HMM, BUT IT WAS YOUR IDEA. YOU'RE THE ONE DESERVES ALL THE CREDIT. WE ALL WORKED ON IT TOGETHER. "WE" MEANS PERCY, DON'T IT? SHE DID HER SHARE. IF ANYONE DESERVES THANKIN', IT'S HER. LIKE FOR MENTIONING WHAT HAPPENED IN CENTER LOVELL... WHILE YOU WERE RUBBING ELBOWS IN THE KITCHEN? [LAUGHS] WELL, WHAT IF SHE DID? WHAT WOULD BE SO TERRIBLE ABOUT THAT? NOTHING. EXCEPT I KNEW THIS COULD NEVER HAVE COME FROM YOU. WHY NOT? WHY COULDN'T IT HAVE COME FROM ME, NAHUM? 'CAUSE YOU'RE JUST PLAIN NOT SMART ENOUGH, SHELBY. THAT'S WHY. [SIGHS] IF YOU WANT A CLEAN SHIRT FOR YOURSELF FOR TOMORROW, YOU CAN WASH IT YOURSELF. [MAN] $100 FOR THIS PLACE? [CHUCKLING] NOT FROM ME. [WOMAN] I WOULDN'T TAKE IT FOR FREE. MEESHACK, YOU HAVIN' THE SPECIAL TODAY? I WIN SOMETHIN' IF I DO? YEAH, BUT YOU GOTTA TALK REAL PRETTY, AND IT'LL COST YA. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT. YOU'RE ALL SO WORKED UP ABOUT THIS DAMN CONTEST.

[GARY] WHAT'S THAT? WHAT THAT PERCY TALBOTT REALLY CAME HERE FOR. [TYPING] NAHUM, AIN'T THAT DOG DIED YET? SHELBY TOLD ME THIS WHOLE THING WAS HER IDEA. WHAT'S TO SAY IT'S NOT SOME SCAM SHE COOKED UP WITH ALL HER PRISON FRIENDS? IF IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER, I RAN HER RECORDS. THERE'S NO HISTORY OF FRAUD OR ROBBERY. NO, SHE WENT TO PRISON FOR MANSLAUGHTER, DIDN'T SHE, GAR? NAHUM, SHE PAID HER DEBT. IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE. THERE'S GOTTA BE WELL OVER $200,000 IN HANNAH'S SAFE BY NOW. I'D LIKE TO THINK I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. [MAN POUNDING GAVEL] LET'S BRING THIS MEETING TO ORDER. [MAN #2] I SAY IT'S HANNAH'S PLACE TO DO WITH AS SHE PLEASES. YEAH. IT'LL RUIN THIS PLACE. RUIN IT? FROM WHAT? WE GOT STRANGERS CRAWLIN' ALL OVER US NOW, AND MORE COMING EVERY DAY. [CROWD CONTINUES CHATTERING] HEY. THEIR BARK'S A LOT WORSE THAN THEIR BITE, YOU KNOW. IT'S NOT LIKE I CAME HERE LOOKIN' TO START TROUBLE. NO, I KNOW, BUT-- THEY'RE JUST NOT USED TO CHANGE. THAT'S ALL. IT SCARES 'EM. THEY'LL JUST SHOUT IT ALL OUT, AND THAT'LL BE THAT. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S A LAW YOU GOTTA STAND AROUND HERE AND LISTEN TO IT. IS THERE? [CHATTERING CONTINUES] [SIGHS] NO. WELL...YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE? SURE. YEAH. [PERCY] SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SHOW ME? [JOE] JUST THESE. THE WORTHLESS TREES? MAYBE NOT ANYMORE. I COME UPON THIS FELLA OUT HERE THE OTHER DAY. TURNS OUT HE'S SOME SORT OF A RESEARCH SCIENTIST. HE SAID HE'D BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER THE NORTH FOR THIS SPECIAL MEDICAL COMPOUND... THAT CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN THE BARK OF TREES, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT. NOW, HE WAS FIGURIN' THAT IT HAD TO BE ONLY IN FIRST-GROWTH TREES, BUT HE COULDN'T FIND IT. THEN HE COME UP HERE AND SAW THESE. TURNS OUT, THIS COMPOUND HE'S AFTER ONLY HAPPENS IN STUMP GROWTH LIKE THIS, WHEN THE TREE TRIES TO REGENERATE ITSELF. HE SAID HE COULD KICK HIMSELF FOR BEING SO STUPID. HOLD ON. THIS SCIENTIST FELLA, WHAT'S HE LOOK LIKE? UH, HAD A BEARD, SORT OF SCRAPPY LOOKIN'. DRIVIN' A TAN COMPACT CAR? UH-HUH, YEAH, THAT'S HIM. I SEEN THAT GUY, SNIFFIN' ON TREES AND CHEWIN' ON THEIR BARK. I THOUGHT HE'D GONE CLEAR OFF HIS ROCKER. WELL, IF HE HAS, I'M GOIN' WITH HIM. HE WORKS FOR THIS DRUG COMPANY, RIGHT? HE'S TALKING ABOUT SETTING UP A PROJECT OUT HERE TO HARVEST ALL THE BARK AND, UH, TO STIMULATE MORE STUMP. YEAH? YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL STILL IN THE TALKING PHASE, OF COURSE, BUT, IF THE NUMBERS THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT EVEN ADD UP BY HALF, UH-HUH... THIS COULD KEEP GILEAD ON THE MAP. WELL, I'D CALL THAT REAL GOOD NEWS FOR Y'ALL. REAL GOOD NEWS. YEAH. YEAH, AND, UH, I THINK, MAYBE, IT COULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR US, TOO. "US"? YEAH. DON'T ASK ME TO EXPLAIN THIS, BUT, THAT FIRST NIGHT, WHEN YOU COME INTO TOWN, MM-HMM. I HAD THIS FEELIN' THAT SOMETHING REALLY GOOD WAS GONNA HAPPEN. AND I'LL BE DAMNED...

IF YOU CHOOSE TO LIVE WITH THAT HOPE, THAT'S YOUR FAULT, NOT MINE-- "CHOOSE"? [SLAPS PERCY] I LOST MY SON! YOU THINK I CHOSE THAT? YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

SHE MAY HAVE PULLED THE WOOL OVER YOUR EYES AND HANNAH'S BOTH, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE REST OF US CAN'T SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. OR MAYBE YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT SHE HELPED FILL THAT SAFE OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF HER HEART. GOD'S SAKE. FOR YOUR INFORMATION, NAHUM, PERCY IS TAKING HANNAH INTO LEWISTON FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING TO PUT THE MONEY IN THE BANK. [EXHALES] OH, GOOD GOD. WHAT? GOOD GOD.

YOU HAVE GOT THAT SAME CHIP ON YOUR SHOULDER NOW THAT YOU DID WHEN ELI WAS ALIVE. THE WHOLE TOWN LOOKED UP TO HIM.

GO ON BACK TO YOUR STORE. I'LL GO BACK WHEN IT SUITS ME. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, GARY. PERCY DIDN'T TAKE THAT MONEY. THIS IS PAST YOU NOW, SHELBY. JUST STAY OUT OF IT. NO, NOT THIS TIME! SO HELP ME, NAHUM, IF YOU CONDEMN THAT GIRL WITHOUT PROOF, I'LL QUIT YOU FOR GOOD. I SWEAR. WELL, WHEN I WAS OUT WALKING LAST NIGHT, I SAW PERCY BRING A SACK OUT ON THE BACK PORCH AND THEN SIT THERE LIKE SHE WAS WAITING FOR SOMEONE. WHEN I LOOKED AGAIN THIS MORNING, THE SACK WAS GONE, AND THERE WERE FRESH TRACKS LEADIN' INTO THE WOODS. WELL, YOU BETTER GO BACK TO THE OFFICE WITH ME. SOUNDS LIKE WE NEED TO ORGANIZE A SEARCH. EFFY, WILL YOU WATCH MOLLY FOR A MINUTE? I'M GONNA GO FIND PERCY. SHELBY! SHELBY! [DOOR SLAMS] HERE'S THE SITUATION. I'VE GOT FRED AND WILLY COMIN' DOWN WITH THEIR DOGS, AND I GOT TOM COMING OVER FROM CUMBERLAND. IF YOU COULD SEND ME A COUPLE TROOPERS, THAT WOULD BE A GREAT HELP. YEAH. GREAT. THANK YOU. [SHELBY] PERCY. I THOUGHT IN SOMEPLACE SMALL LIKE THIS, THERE MIGHT JUST BE A CHANCE, YOU KNOW? BUT AFTER WHAT I DONE, IT DON'T MATTER WHERE I GO. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, PERCY? WELL, I KILLED SOMEBODY. MASON TALBOTT. SEEMED LIKE HE WAS SET ON HAVING ME NOT A WEEK AFTER HE MARRIED MY MAMA. I WAS 9. I GUESS SHE WAS JUST TOO AFRAID OF LOSIN' HIM. SHE'D JUST SLAP ME AND TELL ME SHUT UP ABOUT IT. I WAS 16 WHEN I GOT PREGNANT. AND I HATED WHAT HE DONE TO ME, BUT I FOUND MYSELF LOVIN' THAT LIFE INSIDE ME. FEELIN' IT GROW, MOVE EVEN. I GOT TO CALLIN' IT JOHNNY B. FOR THAT SONG, YOU KNOW? JOHNNY B. GOODE. I FIGURED THAT'D WORK FOR A BOY OR A GIRL. AND I SWORE TO GOD THAT WHEN THAT BABY CAME, I WAS GONNA PROTECT IT... FROM THE LIKES OF MASON, NO MATTER WHAT. I FIGURED SINCE I WAS PREGNANT, HE'D FINALLY LEAVE ME ALONE. THE MORE I STAYED AWAY FROM HIM, THE MADDER HE GOT. ONE NIGHT, HE WAS DRUNK. HE COME AFTER ME AGAIN. I TRIED TO FIGHT HIM. AND HE TOOK TO ME WITH HIS FISTS SO BAD. THE BABY JUST-- I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR BETTER THAN 2 WEEKS, AND ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS HOW I HADN'T KEPT MY PROMISE. I KNEW THERE WAS NO WAY GOD WOULD EVER FORGIVE ME FOR THAT. MASON MUST HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF THE POLICE OR SOMETHING... 'CAUSE HE COME AND TOOK ME FROM THE HOSPITAL BEFORE IT WAS TIME. AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE WAS GOIN', BUT... IT SEEMED LIKE I WAS IN THE BACK OF THAT CAR FOR DAYS. WE WERE IN SOME MOTEL SOMEWHERE. HE HAD A BOTTLE. HE WAS INTO IT REAL GOOD. AND HE STARTED TALKIN', STARTED SAYIN' HOW IT WAS RIGHT THAT MY BABY DIED, THAT IT WEREN'T NEVER MEANT TO BE... AND ALL HE NEEDED WAS ANOTHER MOUTH TO FEED. AND I DON'T THINK I SAID NOTHIN'. BUT I RECALL SEEIN' THE STRAIGHT RAZOR HE HAD SITTIN' ON THAT CHEST OF DRAWERS IN THERE. AND IT WAS STILL TOO LATE. [CRYING] TURNS OUT, THAT MOTEL WAS IN MAINE. HEY, FRANK. GUESS YOU HEARD WE GOT A LITTLE TROUBLE HERE. SURE DID. [NAHUM] SHELBY'S CAR. ONE SECOND, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [FRANK] OKAY. OH, PERCY. I KNEW YOU DIDN'T TAKE THAT MONEY. WHAT MONEY? HANNAH'S MONEY? [DOOR OPENS] I AM NOT GONNA LET YOU ARREST HER, GAR. SHELBY, CALM DOWN. NOBODY'S GETTING ARRESTED. I JUST WANT TO TALK TO PERCY ALONE. [SHELBY] BUT, GARY-- THE SOONER YOU LET IT GO, THE SOONER I CAN FIND OUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON. PERCY, WOULD YOU COME WITH ME, PLEASE? PERCY, JUST GO WITH THEM AND ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS, AND EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT. I PROMISE. SHE HASN'T RUN OFF WITH ANYTHING! SHE WAS OVER THERE IN THAT CHURCH DAMNING HERSELF... FOR A PAST THAT WOULD'VE KILLED YOU OR ME. HANNAH, YOU CAN'T TURN YOUR BACK ON THAT GIRL FOR NO REASON. WHAT HAPPENED HERE? WE HAD A FIGHT. I SLAPPED HER. WHY? WHAT IN GOD'S NAME COULD SHE HAVE DONE TO BRING ON THAT? STOP IT! JUST STOP IT! YOU'VE GOT NO RIGHT! NO, YOU STOP IT! YOU'VE GOT NO RIGHT! I'VE SAID ALL I'M GONNA SAY ABOUT IT! THE MONEY IS GONE! IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS! WHEN-- WHEN PERCY TOLD WHAT HAPPENED TO HER, THERE WAS A CHILD? YES. [SIREN BLARING] MR. BOGGS. MEESHACK. LOOK, I GOT SOME CRAZY MESSAGE FROM SHELBY. WHAT IS GOING ON? THAT TALBOTT GIRL TOOK HANNAH'S MONEY, GIVE IT TO SOME PARTNER IN THE WOODS. WE'RE SPLITTIN' UP NOW TO GO OUT AFTER HIM. [BELL JINGLES] SHELBY? SHELBY... WHAT IS HAPPENIN'? WHAT IS THIS ABOUT PERCY HAVIN' SOME PARTNER IN THE WOODS? I DON'T KNOW. NAHUM SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HER LEAVIN' A SACK ON THE BACK PORCH FOR SOMEONE LAST NIGHT. WAIT! THAT CAN'T BE WHO THEY'RE ALL RUNNIN' AFTER! FROM WHAT I HEAR, YEAH, IT IS. OH, NO! NO! [DOGS BARKING, [TIRES SQUEALING] [SIRENS BLARING] WHERE'S PERCY? HAVE THEY TAKEN HER SOMEWHERE? I DON'T KNOW. SHE WAS JUST UP AT GARY'S BEFORE, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS NOW. [WHIMPERS] [SIRENS CONTINUE] [HANNAH] WHERE'S PERCY? I NEED YOUR HELP. I CAN'T HELP YOU, WOMAN! JUST LEAVE ME ALONE! [SIRENS CONTINUE] BUT-- [CRYING] IT'S HAPPENIN' AGAIN. I'M TRYIN' TO SAVE HIM, AND I CAN'T. [DOGS BARKING] [MEN CHATTERING, DOGS BARKING] COME ON, FELLAS. COME WITH ME. WE'LL GO TO THE RIGHT. I TRIED EVERYTHING I COULD TO FIND HIM. BUT SHORT OF TAKIN' THE FOOD I PUT OUT FOR HIM, HE'D NEVER LET ME NEAR HIM. SEE, I THOUGHT IF I SOLD THE GRILL, THAT I COULD USE THAT MONEY TO GET HELP. BUT YOU-- YOU'VE SEEN HIM, HAVEN'T YA? IS THAT WHO THEY THINK I GAVE THE MONEY TO? YES. THEY'RE GOIN' AFTER HIM? YES! AND I'M SO AFRAID OF WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN! I KNOW I COULD FIND HIM, HANNAH. I KNOW I COULD, BUT THEY AIN'T GONNA LET ME GO NOW. YES, THEY WILL. ARE YOU ON THE RIVER ROAD? SHE'S GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW. UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME, THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENIN'. NOW HOLD ON, HANNAH! [DOGS HOWLING] [MEN TALKING, DOGS BARKING] [DOGS BARKING] [PERCY] JOHNNY B.! JOHNNY B.! JOHNNY B.! [PERCY] RUN! THEY'RE COMIN' AFTER YOU! RUN! [GASPING] YEAH!

I, UH-- I NEVER KNEW PERCY TALBOTT. UM, I ONLY THOUGHT I DID. I, UH, THOUGHT SHE WAS A STRANGER... WHO COULD BRING NO GOOD TO MY AUNT, TO MY FAMILY... OR TO THIS TOWN. AND I THOUGHT I KNEW HER SO WELL... THAT I TOOK THAT MONEY OUT OF THE SAFE... TO KEEP HER FROM STEALIN' IT. I THOUGHT I KNEW HER SO WELL, AND MORE THAN ANYONE... I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DEATH. I THOUGHT I KNEW PERCY TALBOTT, BUT I WAS WRONG, AS WRONG CAN BE. I NEVER KNEW PERCY TALBOTT. [SIGHS] [SIGHS, SNIFFLING] YOU KNOW, TODAY WAS THE... OFFICIAL END OF THE CONTEST. YOU STILL GONNA GO THROUGH WITH IT? SEEMS ONLY RIGHT TO LET THE SPITFIRE GO NOW. ARE YOU LEAVING GILEAD? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
