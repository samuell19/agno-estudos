(grand orchestral music) (suspenseful percussive music) (suspenseful percussive music) It's like selling ice to the Eskimos. I can't believe we pulled it off. They need those coprocessors. Hell, if they knew how to make 'em they wouldn't have to buy 'em. Next year, they will know how. By next year, I might have something better. What? An idea, maybe. (laughing) [John] Guys, I'm gonna run up to the room grab the number of this hot young apprentice geisha have her call a couple of friends, and we will have a celebration. [Paul] Listen, John, you go for a celebration party. Go and have fun. I got a little work to do in the morning. I'm gonna have a drink at the bar and go to bed. [John] See you in the morning. So, you up for this chick? ♪ I like cowboy boots ♪ ♪ You can win ♪ ♪ And wet your jeans ♪ ♪ With your birthday suit ♪ [Paul] Scotch, please. [Bartender] Yes. ♪ Pay a lot of money ♪ ♪ Just to make you feel fine ♪ ♪ I like cowboy ♪ ♪ I like cowboy boots ♪ ♪ It don't look like much ♪ ♪ That ain't flat and wide ♪ ♪ When I'm wearing cowboy boots ♪ ♪ I've nothing to hide ♪ ♪ But I swagger down the avenue ♪ ♪ With my pointy toes ♪ ♪ We love a prairie ♪ ♪ And my chaps alone ♪ ♪ I like cowboy boots ♪ (light flute music) (light country music) Computer chips? Yeah. I know it doesn't sound very interesting. You like computer chips? I make a pretty good living. What do you do? I drink sake. I can see that. Should you drink any more? No. Listen, it's pretty early. Maybe we could go out for dinner, or see some Kabuki or go for, Bunduraku, which is my personal favorite. (laughing) Or, there's a great Tiko concert in the gardens. Tiko? Tiko, you know, drums. Taiko. (percussive music) (light flute music) (all applauding) (suspenseful percussive music) Can I try? Thanks. I guess it's good night. (chuckling) I, I had a great time. Very special. Thank you. Maybe, I'll see you again. I'll see you tomorrow for coffee, and at the coffee shop. Okay, listen, I'm not very good at this. I'm, okay, goodbye. Coat. What? Oh. My coat. Thanks. (light flute music) Don't go. But I thought you said... Don't go if you don't want to go. I don't want to go. (door clicking) (light percussive music) Nice room. How long are you staying? [Kirina] Just tonight. [Paul] Oh, really? Are you visiting Nagoya for business or your family? [Kirina] Not visiting. Then, what are you doing here? (speaking foreign language) (chuckling) I'm sorry, I don't speak Japanese. (speaking foreign language) Oh, shut up. Piggies. Oh, yeah I like piggies. Yeah. I like piggies, too. Good. (percussive flute music) You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna cancel my flight. I'm gonna cancel my appointments. I'm gonna stay here for a few days. It's true, I've only been in Japan on business, and, maybe I thought you and I could do a little sightseeing, or... It sounds nice but it's impossible. [Paul] I see. You have a husband. No. No husband. [Paul] Do you have a boyfriend? No. [Paul] Then I don't understand. Understand, you must leave now. I, I will never be able to explain to you what tonight meant for me. Thank you. (light flute music) I don't even know your name. Kirina. Kirina. (suspenseful percussive music) Goodbye. Live long. (light flute music) (suspenseful percussive music) [Kinjo] I was told to do it as painlessly as possible. Let me see your face. Before you kill me, let me see your face. (elevator dinging) No one but you has seen my face. I am known by reputation. (elevator dinging) Kirina. I was sent because he wanted the best. My skill is unmatched. It takes great skill to butcher an unarmed woman. Enough! You can die painlessly or slowly. (clattering) Choose. I wish to die slowly and with much pain so I remember what it was to be alive. You have great courage. But I have orders that it be quick. I am sorry. Be sorry for yourself. I am free. You are a coward, a slave. Room 2103. Send police immediately. No! (gasping) Don't touch him! Go quickly. (siren wailing) (laughing) [Both] Hi. (siren wailing) (speaking foreign language) (machine beeping) (dramatic synth music) No! (machine beeping) (light flute music) (percussive music) (all shouting) (all shouting) (sighing) (speaking foreign language) (light synth music) (suspenseful percussive music) (breathing heavily) Mr. Racine, I have brought two visitors to see you. Takeda Sensei and Mrs. Takeda. Takeda Sensei is a master of Kenjutsu and a descendant of a great samurai family. He believes, and I also believe, that your life is in great danger. Danger? From what? The men who attacked you, they are ninja from a cult called the Makato. Their leader is named Kinjo. No one outside of the Makato has ever seen Kinjo's face and lived. Nothing can stop them from finding and killing you. So, how did they screw up and leave me alive? (speaking foreign language) Even monkeys fall out of trees. But they will not fail a second time. We must get you out of here immediately. I'm supposed to believe I'm safer with you than in a hospital room guarded by the police? We will take you to a safe place. An island off the coast of... Listen, listen, listen. I don't know you, either of you. And I don't believe you. I'm sorry, I can't think anymore. (sighing) Mieko. (door clicking) (light flute music) (door clicking) I'm sorry, but I can't go with you. Even if I wanted to... Don't think of it now. We will stay in Nagoya for two days. If you need our help, please call me at this number. (light flute music) (speaking foreign language) (bell tolling) (percussive music) Sujin, Masado, come. I have called you before me so that you can fulfill your plan. Plan, Lord? Was it not your plan to have my soul weakened so you could steal my power? Why else would you fail to kill a man who has seen my face? [Masado] Lord, it is impossible. [Sujin] We cut his throat. [Masado] He was poisoned! [Sujin] I'm sure he was dead. He's alive. Since you are too well-trained to make such a mistake, you must have planned to betray me. Now it's your opportunity. The foreigner has stolen a piece of my soul. Just kill what remains. Test me. See if I have lost my powers. Master, we failed you, but are forever loyal! (grunting) You betrayed me! You will not die quickly. I will bury you up to your neck and leave you rot in the sun. Sujin, pick up your sword. You would have been my successor. Now, you have only one chance to live. I now decree, if Sujin kills me in combat he shall be my rightful heir and your Lord. Sujin. Yeah. Come on. (sword slicing) (grunting) (suspenseful percussive music) (grunting) Get up! Here, take it. Come. Come! (screaming) (grunting) (spitting) Make them suffer. (percussive music) (light flute music) (sighing) Kirina. A whore with the face of a goddess and the spirit of a tiger. I have killed 100 men and women. Never hesitated. I can't believe that the gods would want such a woman to die. They must be angry with me. The gods are not angry with you, My Lord. You are haunted by a memory, a ghost. When a woodsman cuts down a tree he must allow time for its spirit to escape. As the woman died, her spirit clung to the man. Cut him down and it will depart. Yes. He must die. (sighing) I will kill him tonight. No. The spell of the woman has poisoned you. Send another. Do not tempt the gods. (sighing) Junko. You are wise. I will send my best men. They will bring me his head. And then, it shall be buried forever. (speaking foreign language) (dramatic orchestral music) (speaking foreign language) (sword whooshing) (remote clicking) (light percussive music) (coughing) (knocking on door) (door clicking) Mr. Racine, what are you doing out of bed? What am I doing? I'm getting out of here, that's what I'm doing. (light percussive music) You've seen too many samurai movies. You're safest here. We have taken every precaution. The stakeout across the street will make sure no one can slip in from outside. There are two more police officers in the hallway and a backup is parked outside. You are safer in this room than you could be strolling in Central Park. (light percussive music) What about this ninja cult? The Makato? [Man] Ah, Dr. Yamura told you that. He's repeating rumors and superstitions. There are no ninja cults in modern Japan. (speaking foreign language) (grunting) (gun firing) (yelling) What about Kinjo? Kinjo? He told you that, too? [Paul] Yeah. Kinjo is a myth, a boogeyman. The crime syndicates encourage these stories to frighten people. (gun firing) (grunting) Supposedly, there's a secret farm town full of ninjas. They kidnap children and train them to be assassins. It's ridiculous! (chuckling) This isn't ancient Japan. We don't have ninja running around with swords any more than you have cowboys and Indians fighting in Manhattan. (laughing) In any case no swordsman can get past a trained police officer carrying a modern gun. (laughing) (grunting) (bomb exploding) (electricity crackling) (speaking foreign language) (grunting) (suspenseful percussive music) Maybe I was wrong. Maybe? (gun firing) (gun firing) (yelling) (speaking foreign language) (window shattering) (grunting) (clattering) (suspenseful percussive music) (wind howling) (gun firing) (grunting) (groaning) (grunting) (window shattering) (suspenseful percussive music) (alarm blaring) (Paul panting) (speaking foreign language) (thunder crashing) (light percussive music) (speaking foreign language) (all chattering) (speaking foreign language) (machines chiming) (machines chiming) Hey. I need a phone. A phone. (speaking foreign language) (phone dialing) (line ringing) [Paul] Hello? [Mieko] Mr. Racine? [Paul] Yes. [Mieko] Are you all right? We heard that ninjas attacked the hospital. Are you safe? [Paul] I don't know. [Mieko] You think they are following you? I don't know. But I can't wait for you here. I may need to run. [Mieko] Can you get to the railway station? Maybe. How do you say, Get me a taxi, in Japanese? (speaking foreign language) Okay. (speaking foreign language) It works. I'll meet you at the station. Stand in the open. I'll find you. [Mieko] Are you sure you can do it? We'll see. Stop! Stop playing! Don't you know this is just a form of gambling? Know what gambling does to you? It steals your soul. Don't touch me! Gambling causes impotence! It leads to mental destruction! It has to stop! (all screaming) (gun firing) Shit! Let's go! Go! Come on! (suspenseful percussive music) Take me to the train station. Train station. Train. (imitating train) (speaking foreign language) Don't ask me. (speaking foreign language) You're probably going to take me to the toy store. (radio chattering) Listen. Keep the change, and take her home. Home. Oh, no. I think you've done enough for tonight. Bye, angel. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Go home now. (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) Takeda is impressed, Mr. Racine. Really? No one's escaped the Makato before. Now you've done it twice. Well, tell him it's not a skill I wanna keep practicing. When do we leave? There is a five a.m. bullet train for Mihara. We can take a boat from there to the island. (speaking foreign language) Somebody followed you? I don't think so. (light synth music) (gasping) Easy. It is only water. (sighing) Did you have a vision? I don't know. A hallucination, maybe. It is poison from the shurikens. The ninja use it because it is quick. In small doses, it helps you to see into the world of the spirits. Maybe I'll use some next time I go to a Grateful Dead concert. (light flute music) Thank you. (speaking foreign language) What? They are here. How does he know? It's best to keep moving. We must trust in Takeda. He knows. (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful percussive music) (alarm ringing) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful percussive music) (speaking foreign language) I gotta rest. (knocking on door) (yelling) (groaning) (grunting) (all shouting) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (all screaming) (all shouting) (speaking foreign language) (all shouting) (suspenseful percussive music) (all shouting) (speaking foreign language) (grunting) (eerie ambient music) (yelling) (grunting) (sword clanging) (suspenseful percussive music) (electricity crackling) (speaking foreign language) (screaming) (grunting) (swords clanging) (grunting) (grunting) (electricity crackling) (groaning) (grunting) (suspenseful percussive music) (electricity crackling) (grunting) (grunting) (glass shattering) (swords clanging) (grunting) [Takeda] No guns! (gun firing) (air hissing) (gasping) (glass shattering) (wind howling) What do we do if he loses? Takeda will not lose. (swords clanging) (grunting) (wind howling) Racine! Come here! Is this Kinjo? No. No? You think I would forget his face? Is this Kinjo? Come! Is this him? No, it's not him. (camera shutter clicking) (speaking foreign language) [Man] Mr. Racine? Yeah? Please, follow me. Please. [Paul] Okay. (speaking foreign language) (camera shutter clicking) (sword clanging) Ah. (birds chirping) (percussive music) (speaking foreign language) How did you talk your way past the police? It's all right. We are safe. Listen, I don't want to sound ungrateful, but I would like to know why you're helping me. Two centuries ago a rival clan hired the Makato to destroy Takeda family. They almost succeeded. The Makato will keep killing until someone stops them. That is why Takeda hoped Kinjo was on the train. Their leader has never lost a battle. [Paul] That's why you want to help me? For something that happened hundreds of years ago? [Mieko] When Kinjo comes, Takeda will fight him. [Paul] What if he doesn't come? [Takeda] He will come. Listen. I would like to get word to my company, tell them I'm okay. No. (speaking foreign language) That would be a mistake. Kinjo will learn where you are. You're tired. Rest. Yeah. You're right. Thank you. I will take you to your room. Okay? (speaking foreign language) [Paul] What a beautiful place. [Mieko] Isn't it? (speaking foreign language) (all shouting) (speaking foreign language) Oshima! (muttering) [Kinjo] You, go away. (suspenseful ambient music) My Lord. The... I know. They're dead. I send my best men to be slaughtered by a ghost that only I could kill. Junko. She was also. I should have never listened to that woman. Send out all our spies. I want to know everything that happened. I want to know where he is. Not heaven nor hell can stop me from killing a man. Now leave me. This ghost that will not die. Who is hunting whom? I wonder. (light synth music) (gasping) (shouting in distance) (suspenseful percussive music) (grunting) (speaking foreign language) Excuse me? (speaking foreign language) The other one? (speaking foreign language) You know, I'm not exactly in good shape right now, but I guess, oh thanks. Thanks. Yeah. That's much better. Thank you, thank you. (speaking foreign language) What are you doing? Thanks a lot. That's much better. Thank you. Shit. What does he think I am, a donkey? (light percussive music) Okay, I'm gonna head back to the castle. It was a lovely afternoon. (speaking foreign language) Excuse me. (speaking foreign language) That's nice. (speaking foreign language) Oh, water. Thank you. That's nice. (spitting) (laughing) Are you crazy? (speaking foreign language) God, sake. My God! Sake. Oh, God. (grunting) My God, it's the worst sake. Thank you. Well, it's not that bad after all. (light percussive music) He tricked me. He tricked me with this cheap homemade sake. I wish I could speak Japanese so this guy would understand the meaning of the words, I'm not a donkey. Hey, come on. Okay? I've been cleaning this five times already. Stop the dust! Okay? I'm doing you a favor. Don't take advantage of me. (blowing) Then do it yourself. (mysterious percussive music) (speaking foreign language) I have seen one before. (speaking foreign language) Are you sure? This doesn't feel right. It should be it's a sword. (speaking foreign language) Take it easy. Where's he going? (light percussive music) (speaking foreign language) Apple. (shouting) (laughing) That was great. (speaking foreign language) Thanks. It's even better. (speaking foreign language) Listen. Can you teach me? (all chattering) (singing in foreign language) (men chattering) (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful percussive music) (grunting) This better be your sister. Put it down. I don't like you having pictures of other girls around. What's so special about this one? Put it down. (glass shattering) [Woman] There, it's down. (glass shattering) You little whore! You better learn to respect me! (eerie ambient music) Who are you? What? Kinjo! What are you doing here? How did you get in? [Kinjo] Leave silently. Don't come back. Why did you kill Kirina? I didn't. You killed her. [Kinjo] Why did you have her killed? [Nemura] She defied me. [Kinjo] How? [Nemura] She asked to leave me. (grunting) [Kinjo] Why? I don't know. (grunting) [Kinjo] Why? I bought her in Soapland. Her mother died at birth. Her pimp uncle sold her to people worse than me. I gave her fine clothes, jewels. Everything! Expensive things! (grunting) [Kinjo] Why did you kill her? She begged me for freedom for years. Then demanded it, freedom from me, Boss Nemura! I told her if she left me, I would kill her. [Kinjo] And? She left me. (grunting) (suspenseful percussive music) (metal clanging) (sword hissing) (laughing) (grunting) (door sliding) Racine, outside. (light percussive music) So, you want to study Kenjutsu. No. We were just fooling around. Killing time. Time does not die. Only people. Come, I'll teach you. You have much to learn. (sword clanging) Right hand! In Japan, no left hand. (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful percussive music) Didn't that drunk teach you anything? Let's find out. Attack! (swords clanging) (laughing) (speaking foreign language) (swords clanging) (grunting) (speaking foreign language) The lesson is not over yet. [Takeda] It is finished. No, I still have much to learn. (suspenseful percussive music) Don't mock me, Racine. (swords clanging) (grunting) So the old drunk taught me something after all. (swords clanging) Enough. I could have killed you 10 times. Why didn't you? I'm learning, Takeda. Finally learning. Why don't you kill me? You want to. I can see it in your eyes. Stop fighting. I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding. His English isn't... He understands English when he wants to. Ask him why he's so sure that Kinjo will come on this island. I know ninja. No, the trail is cold by now. If Kinjo knew where I was, he would've showed up long ago. Kinjo will come. Of course, he will come. Because you'll tell him I'm here. That's how Kinjo's men found us on the train. You sent word to them. It's true, isn't it? Ask him if it's true! They would find you anyway. No, not on a train filled with innocent people. They were slaughtered so you could test your skill! Paul, please! Don't make him angry. Takeda won't hurt me. He also won't let me leave. I'm your prisoner, right? You are free to go. See how long you live without me to protect you! That's exactly what I'm gonna do. I'm taking the first flight back to New York. And I'm gonna send Kinjo a postcard, see how well he does on my turf. (light percussive music) (speaking foreign language) Sorry, Mr. Racine. I request that you stay. Request or command? It will be foolish for you to leave. You think I don't know what's going on? Do you really think a bunch of kids can take on professional assassins? You're going to get them all killed. But I'm not gonna let you. The bait is leaving. This is between me and Kinjo. It's between him and me, me! So, get the hell out of the way! (punch thudding) Not bad for a gaijin. (laughing) Very good for gaijin. Takeda? He wants to challenge you in combat. If you come alone and defeat him, Racine will be handed to you. So anxious to die. Then send word that you accept? Of course. (light flute music) I came to say goodbye. Help me escape. Kinjo only wants me. Everyone is in danger as long as I'm here, and you know it! I must stand by my husband, even if I die. You will be safe here. I will see to it. (suspenseful percussive music) (door sliding) (speaking foreign language) (muttering) (suspenseful percussive music) (doors creaking) (light flute music) (dart whooshing) (grunting) (water splashing) (water splashing) (light percussive music) Hey, can you help me? Oh, God, it's gonna take a week. Shh, shh, shh, shh. (grunting) (suspenseful percussive music) (grunting) (yelling) (all shouting) (guns firing) (swords clanging) (yelling) (swords clanging) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (speaking foreign language) [Paul] Yeah, in the boat. Thanks for helping. (speaking foreign language) Mieko. I can't leave Mieko. I can't keep running away. It's got to end here one way or another. If I've learned anything from Kirina it's that you have to accept your fate with courage. So, I'm gonna try. (speaking foreign language) You go. Yes, yes. (speaking foreign language) Yes. Thank you. (speaking foreign language) Have a drink on me. (suspenseful percussive music) (swords clanging) (chains rattling) (grunting) (scoffing) (grunting) (chains rattling) (grunting) (suspenseful percussive music) (light flute music) (grunting) (snapping) (gasping) (suspenseful percussive music) (thunder crashing) (swords clanging) (grunting) (swords clanging) (grunting) (eerie ambient music) (swords clanging) (grunting) (light flute music) (swords clanging) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (sword stabbing) (thunder crashing) (suspenseful percussive music) (thunder crashing) (swords clanging) (light synth music) (thunder crashing) (swords clanging) (grunting) Looking for me? (grunting) Left hand. Maybe I got a chance. (swords clanging) (grunting) (wood creaking) (grunting) (wood creaking) (wood thudding) (thunder crashing) (suspenseful percussive music) Break the sword. It's a living symbol of the Makato. Once it is broken they are finished. (eerie ambient music) (shouting) (panting) (suspenseful flute music) (grunting) (rock thudding) (grunting) (rock thudding) (grunting) (panting) Don't you ever give up? (ominous ambient music) (shouting) (grunting) (panting) (light flute music) Thanks. Takeda? But he will rest easier now. I'm sorry. Let me help you. (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) I don't want to say you're late, but it's over. (suspenseful percussive music)
