Please open the door I think there was a misunderstanding I'm not someone to be in here I know you're listening to me so please answer me! Damn it What the hell? Memento mori What the hell is that? Memento mori Remember the death of other's It's latin Remember the death? What is your job? I'm an elementary teacher I remember reading it from a history book Hey you What?

Remember the death of other's? Isn't this a blackmail? Isn't it? I don't think just one person locked us in here Are you also in cahoots? Let's calm down and think carefully We should think about how and why and from where we were kidnapped I don't know I can't remember anything I don't know what day it is today I don't even remember what I was doing before coming here It's like I got Alzheimer's How is this possible? I think the people who put us in here erased our memory They would be watching us and enjoying this moment You're saying that those guys erased our memories? It's possible What is? It's possible to erase our memories if they wanted to Some drugs prescribed for pantidepressant can cause amnesia Lorazepam is one of them According to one research Subjects who took 4 milligrams of Lorazepam couldn't remember things from yesterday What do we do now? We have to figure out the reason why those guys locked us in here Bastards It's a key Screw you Try it yourself then You're the closest one Damn Yikes What is it? Hey lady? You're the closest one Your turn now Me? I'll go with you until I can Come here! Did he die? Let's check it out What if he's alive? He seems like a madman What if that blood is someone else's? What if the room is full of dead bodies! He's right, don't open the door It's weird that he's the only one inside the room when we're all tied up What if he's a good person like us? Shouldn't we help him? A good person like us? Take me out of the category I'm far from a good person What do you know? I've been imprisoned 7 times All from fraud Aren't we all in here because we're similar? Known as scumbags Only you're a scumbag, not us He's a teacher and I'm an author We're qualitatively different from you You were an author?

Try to reach for it Try pulling the cloth slowly I'm not your freaking slave Don't blame me even if I fail Are you alright? Did I get the key? No, it's still on the table Are we really going to die like this? I'm done, you guys do it now What is it? What the hell is that? What is it? 8 minutes 58 seconds 57 seconds It's a timer It's a bomb Are we all going to die in here? This doesn't make sense Why didn't they just kill us at first? Who knows about their thoughts? Do you think it's funny? Is this fun for you? Is it fun to watch the five of us strive? We might all die from the bomb Or maybe find a way out of this place But I won't let you see it Do you get it? What's wrong? This is a fake CCTV Why would they put a fake CCTV? Wait a minute Why didn't I think of this earlier? What is it? Ma'am Can you see the lock? If you can see it from inside It means someone locked in from the inside One of us is lying right now Then that thing wouldn't be a bomb Whoever locked us in here wouldn't die with us right? Let's get the key first Sir I'm done I can't move anymore Why not? Are you hurt? Are you on drugs? People inject drugs through the veins I think he has low blood sugar Those marks are from insulin injection He's a diabetic? - This is shameful - If his blood sugar gets lower He might die from shock We have to get the key first Sir, please help us Forget it Wake up! I'll try it myself Just a little more! Give it to me first! Sir! Hurry up! Let's pull the knife out first No! He'll bleed too much if you pull the knife out I also know that But if I have to choose between his life or this weapon to protect myself - I'll choose the knife - You selfish bastard Let's check out the safe first Can you see what's inside? I'm not sure What is it? Well... Why is there a cake inside? Let him eat it It will make him better What if the cake is not safe? He'll die anyways if he doesn't eat it Let him make the decision By the way Why do you think there are only 8 candles? Wait Why? There's something inside the cake Isn't this a voice recorder? What the hell? Hello? - Mrs. Yoon-Hee? - That's me Your son is with me I kidnapped your son Do-Yoon Is that it? What? - Yeah - Give it to me - Give what? - The recorder Let's listen until the end There's no need to, that's the end It just started playing, didn't you stop it? Why would I stop it? Let go You should let go How dare you Ma'am Wasn't it your voice? I'm sorry but we have to listen until the end It's the only clue to explain why we're in here Please let me listen to my son's voice! Listen carefully Mom! Do-Yoon? Prepare 40 thousand dollars - 40 thousand dollars? - I'll call you back Hello? Hey ma'am I have something to ask you What happened after I called you? My son died Are you denying it? - Deny what? - The man's voice I think it's your voice Are you saying the kidnapper killed the boy? Isn't that obvious? Then it's not me He's right The murder was arrested at the scene where my son was found dead He only took the money and ran away How could you be so naive? Next up is a tip-off of a missing child Do-Yoon, a 1st grader studying at Seon-Mang Elementary School went missing yesterday Do-Yoon is assumed to have gone missing at a playground around 3 P.M. I happened to see the surroundings of your home It was where I worked for 2 years as a rider I realised it was a chance for me So I went to a telephone booth and called you You're a scumbag I know, and I feel sorry Anyways, I took your money and enjoyed it for few months Your call stopped the search for my missing son And after few days, my son was found dead A guy who stayed with my son's dead body was spotted as the culprit And he was plead guilty at the court Are you thinking that I locked everyone in here? It's possible if you were seeking revenge for your son What's the point of finding the real culprit when my son's dead now? But you could kill the real culprit If she's not the one who locked us in here I think I know who locked us in here Who is it? The person who believes the real culprit exists Ma'am What's the name of the guy who was plead guilty at court? Chi-Seop Kang That was his name Is this where the anonymous tipster said? I think it is sir You two go that way Okay sir The police found my son in the woods They said Chi-Seop was playing with my dead son for days That means Chi-Seop could be the first person to find your son Bingo, how unfair could it be for him? How many years was he sentenced? 10 years at a psychiatric hospital Is he Chi-Seop? I'm not totally sure We should find out He might have an ID so look through his pockets - Me? - Only you can reach him - There's nothing - Did you search thoroughly? He might have a key Why don't you do it yourself? Are you serious? Watch your back! Pull the knife! No! He can really die! He'll die instead if he doesn't! What's your name? - It hurts - Stop! Did you lock us in here? It won't hurt if you answer my question What's your name? Chi-Seop Kang I knew it! He's the one who locked us in here! Did you lock us in here? Ouch It hurts Is there anyone outside? It hurts Please stop, he's mentally ill He's just the same like us How could he lock us in here? Pain is a sensory disturbance caused by stimulating the area in contact with the cerebral cortex and limbic system through the afferent nerve track which is consisted of a nociceptor and neurofibromatosis What the hell is he saying? It is not medicable even if I pull the knife out Chi-Seop, were you ever imprisoned? Have you ever been to the National Law Hospital? Address of National Law Hospital is Gongju-si, Bapochogyo-gil, Street 1-21 The name of the hospital changed in June 14th, 2006 I was at that hospital! Who sent you here? I don't know and I'm hurt I don't know anything but I'm hurt We should calm down first Sir Huh? Your back What is it? It there an insect or something? What is it? Can you pull your shirt up? I killed Do-Yoon What is it? Come on, tell me! - I... - A cockroach What? - There's a cockroach on your back - Damn it Where is it? In the middle of your back How dirty can you be? Right? I think it crawled in when I passed out Is it gone now? Yeah, it's gone now Let's gather up and plan a countermeasure Like what the young lady said It's impossible for Chi-Seop to plan all this by himself Just get to the point! What do we have to do to get out of here? Remember the other's death We have to find who really killed Do-Yoon Do you think the real murderer is among one of us? Of course How will you find the real murderer? Step by step, let's thoroughly go through what really happened First of all, you ma'am Yes? I know it's hard, but tell us about your son Do-Yoon was my only child Which school did he go to? Seon-Mang Elementary School What was the cause of his death? Acute subdural haemorrhage from external injury They said Do-Yoon's head was hit by something hard - Next, you sir - Me? Are you feeling guilty of something? No Then come on and introduce yourself My name is Jun-Byeong I'm a teacher Did you ever teach at Seon-Mang Elementary School? What? No So you have nothing to do with that school right? Are you suspecting me? Why are you huffing? That makes you more suspicious - It's a lie - What? He's lying What's going on right now? Why is everyone suspecting me? What's on my back? What's on my back! I killed Do-Yoon I killed Do-Yoon Is that what's written on my back? Is that right? What a joke! How could you all be so pathetic? Who do you think wrote this on my back? The person who locked us in here is the one who wrote it That person is trying to make us suspect each other! We're all under the thumb of that person! You have to be honest with us Or you'll really pay the price I told you it's not me It's not me! Didn't you say he's lying? Yes Hey there Do you know me? Tell me Tell me what I'm lying about! My name is Ha-Jeong I studied at Seon-Mang Elementary School until grade 6 Ha-Jeong? Ha-Jeong? Long time no see Mr. Jun-Byeong I'm doing this because I care for you Then did you know who he was since the beginning? I wasn't totally sure Because I wanted to erase him from my memory Ha-Jeong If you still have hatred towards me I'll apologise for everything If you want me legally punished I'll do as you want What did you do to her? - I saw it - No Ha-Jeong! - I saw... - Please - What happened that day - Please don't say it! The reason why you hid where you taught The reason why I'm in here with you! It's because the boy that I saw that day was Do-Yoon, who studied at Seon-Mang Elementary School You're such a bastard Who are you? Stop there! Hey! How many is this? What's your name and grade? I'm Do-Yoon in Grade 1 You should get punished for running down the stairs You also have to go to the hospital Then your mom will have to come to the hospital also I'm okay I don't want to go to the hospital - But you have to - I don't want to I won't take you to the hospital nor tell your mom about it But promise me you won't tell anyone about what I did to the girl Alright? Do-Yoon seemed totally fine I drove Do-Yoon home I even saw him walking into his house Didn't you open the door for Do-Yoon? Cerebral haemorrhage? I'll get punished if Do-Yoon died from that But wasn't Do-Yoon kidnapped and found dead in the woods? That means I didn't kill Do-Yoon It's not me That day, Do-Yoon came home later than usual Why are you do late? I'm sorry I was worried Come and eat I made pork cutlet for you Mom will go to see dad So finish eating and do your homework My husband's workplace was at YangJoo When I came back home around 6 AM Do-Yoon wasn't home I looked for Do-Yoon everywhere But I eventually had to report him missing My husband's friend who worked at a broadcasting station helped us That broadcast was what I saw It's my falut My son died because of me Do you really not know Do-Yoon? But you two went to the same school Isn't it weird? Why are you in here if you don't know him? You should somehow be related to Do-Yoon Am I not right? I'm in here because the boy that I saw that day was Do-Yoon I also don't understand why I'm here for just that reason It's the same for him if he's not the real culprit He should remember something if he was at the scene Hey there Did you see anything? I didn't see anything Ma'am When exactly did your son go missing? March 18th of year 2000 March 18th, 2000 Saturday and cloudy March 18th of 2000 What did you do in the mountain? I was playing with my friend Are you believing what he's saying? I saw guys like him in the TV They never forget anything they saw That's why he's locked in here with us What did you do with your friend? With my friend? You played airplanes? Where did your friend live? Did you know him before? Where did my friend live? In a bag He was inside a red bag Is the owner of that bag one of us? Don't shout! He'll get scared I'm smart Chi-Seop Do you remember the owner of the red bag? What's wrong? Go and stop him Stop him if you want him to prove your innocence! Stop it now - Calm down - I don't want to take the pills! Damn it I killed Do-Yoon, I killed Do-Yoon... I killed Do-Yoon, please forgive me Please forgive me He's confessing No He's begging from fear Begging to who? - Who's making him scared? - How do I know that? Didn't you know everything until now? Hello? - Mrs. Yoon-Hee? - That's me - I have your son - Why are you playing that again? Was't Chi-Seop falsely accused as the culprit? Then someone should've threatened him as well Who were you with when you were calling? I was with the police Now I get it Chi-Seop got frightened after seeing that guy Detective! Get up! I figured you looked like a cop I won't tell anyone if you let us free now I won't report you to the police If you need money, I'll give it to you What do we have to do now? - What do you want from us? - The statue of limitations ran out but why now? If one of us here was a real adult Do-Yoon wouldn't have died The hell are you saying? Did you bring us here to admonish us? Everything will end if the real culprit confesses What time is it now? One oh ten One of us is still lying I'll give 10 more minutes If the truth isn't revealed in 10 minutes I will drop the key down the drain What if no one here is the real culprit? Please unlock us first and then talk about it together - Alright? - That's right You're making a big mistake How many minutes left? 9 minutes Tell me when the time runs out I'm sorry, please forgive me I'm sorry, it's my fault - Please forgive me - Chi-Seop March 18th of 2000 Saturday and cloudy That's right, who took your friend out of the bag that day? Is that person one of us? Don't look at other people Just look at me and tell me A girl My friend was inside a pretty girl's bag Did you forget what I said? I was only 13 years old at that time! No one said anything I looked at you because he said it was a pretty girl Do-Yoon's mother, did Do-Yoon have any siblings? He had one older sister She was 6 years older than Do-Yoon Do-Yoon is a child between my husband and his ex-wife But I never hated him for that reason I always treated Do-Yoon as my real child Please believe me We wouldn't have known if we didn't ask I was worried people would suspect me like your are doing now Alright? Do-Yoon's sister could've been in Grade 6 at that time Yes but she went to a different school And Do-Yoon's sister and mother was living in another city at that time Ha-Jeong Don't call me like that, it horrifies me Why do you think Do-Yoon came to the classroom? Only Grade 6 classrooms were on the 4th floor Why would a 1st grader come up to the 4th floor? Maybe from curiosity or to do a teacher's favor But it was Saturday after school when almost every teacher left What if he had another reason? Maybe to see his sister? Get to the point Your wrist Didn't you have a mole on your wrist? It disappeared after time Ha-Jeong had a mole behind the ears, not on the wrist I remember it clearly Not many people knew because of her long hair Only her family or boyfriend would know about it You're not Ha-Jeong You're someone that knows both Ha-Jeong and Do-Yoon Damn it Ha-Jeong had a mole behind her ears? You crazy bitch You seemed strange since the beginning Who the hell are you? Did you kill Do-Yoon? Is that so? Did you? Is it time yet? Was it the two of you who locked us in here? We still don't know the real culprit I guess the real culprit doesn't want to confess Who are you guys? Who the hell are you? Mrs. Yoon-Hee? Let's be honest with each other now Your name is Yoon-Hee You're a best-selling author who hits the closing price of every book that comes out But I guess that wasn't enough to satisfy you You flattered around everywhere wanting to reach higher Who are you? 'But Still the Flower Blooms' I really enjoyed your book I even made memos while reading I asked who you are I practiced for more than thousand times for this moment So shut your mouth and listen until I finish Your husband and child died but you couldn't let go of your own life You thought of living for the sake of your husband and child And now you're living for your own sake I'll introduce myself again My real name is Do-Hee I'm Do-Yoon's real sister Ha-Jeong was my friend After my parents got a divorce, I asked Ha-Jeong to take care of Do-Yoon I asked Ha-Jeong to buy Do-Yoon his favourite food every Saturday And also to give him my stationaries and letters that I wrote to Do-Yoon But after Do-Yoon died Ha-Jeong moved school and also moved house Ha-Jeong contacted me again after 16 years It was then when Ha-Jeong told me about her terrible memories Do-Yoon went to see Ha-Jeong to give her a letter that he wrote to me What are you going to do now when it's already 16 years ago? We have to find the real culprit now Detective Chang told me more about what happened Chi-Seop was falsely charged And you're just a gambler and swindler Nothing more or less And now I got to know about you That you made Do-Yoon hurt but didn't kill him Then the only one left is Do-Yoon He was never my real son Come and eat Didn't I tell you I'm going to see dad? I'm sorry Mrs. Yoon-Hee Didn't I tell you to call me mom? Say it, mom My mom is with my sister You're allowed to cry today during your punishment Cry as loud as you can so your mom and sister can hear you Alright? I think the shoehorn broke first After hitting him for some time, he fainted Maybe Do-Yoon wouldn't have died if you took him to the hospital Stop it now After some time, he wasn't breathing anymore So you tried to hide your crime by using the broadcast? The broadcast was my husband's idea My husband called his friend at a broadcasting station right away But that was the stoke of genius It was so funny A man calling himself the kidnapper called me And he let me hear Do-Yoon call me "Mom!" when he never did before There's a guy who calls himself the kidnapper And there's another guy found together with the dead body And the police says the culprit is that crazy man God was on my side You And you And lastly, you Do you guys think you're free from Do-Yoon's death? Stop it now When Do-Yoon was crying for his mom and sister What were you and your mom doing? It's you and your mom who neglected Do-Yoon You two left Do-Yoon alone to an indifferent dad! You even locked us in here and threatened us together with a corrupted police You really are out of your mind You're a worse bitch than I am Shut your mouth! If Do-Yoon was so precious, why didn't you kidnap him yourself? Shut up! You're the one who didn't let us take Do-Yoon! Say your sorry! Whoever killed Do-Yoon for whatever reason I will make them pay the price! Kill me so that I can say sorry to Do-Yoon in hell I tried my best I baught him everything and let him do everything he wanted I tried to treat him as my real child I just wanted him to call me 'Mom' This is all because of you and your mom You should've left Doo-Yoon alone and let him get attached to me and the new family! Even so, that doesn't make you innocent You crazy bitch! You stupid bitch Your the same as your mom and dad You and Do-Yoon are both stupid That's why all of you died Stop it! Just give her the key! Throw me the key I'll kill her so try to kill me as well Just give it to her! Die! I'll put you all in prison Wait and see you bastards! Now I know what kind of a person you are You guys are nothing different Do-Yoon's death was not an accident It was a murder! We are all responsible for Do-Yoon's death Take him to prison, it's an order from the above What? - But he isn't... - Can't you read the room? It's now a nation wide issue and if we don't settle it We'll all get fired It's the chief's order We decided to sponsor the nursery facility that he stayed in Everything will be settled if we sacrifice that one guy Chi-Seop Do you want to get out of here? Yes sir That woman has the key to get out of here Go and get it Don't come Stop Tell him to stop I'll swallow the key! Then I'll cut open your stomach Hurry up! Give it to me Give me the key! Give it to me! Good job Do you know who made you the murderer? Detective Chang in JungNang Police Station You're smarter than I thought What are you doing? I'm sorry but you have to remain as the murderer Detective Chang! Don't blame me I wanted to help you But my life will be harder if you're alive You're the dangerous one to me I think I have to wind things up now Right? You're no different from them Blame yourself for your death Die! I'm sure you'll stab me in the back So die! Sorry It took some time to find the key He's a real bastard What's going on? Didn't I say I'm a professional in fraud? Let's go now You two should stay here Hurry up and take him outside I'll follow soon Let's go Chi-Seop! I'll treat you barbecue There you go That's it I'm sorry I said I'm sorry At least I'm not worse than her If you just leave like this You're committing a real murder! Then you're sinning worse than mine! Don't be scared What the hell? You freaking bastard! - Let's go - Screw you! How can you just leave like this? That's it I got it now Sir! I'm sorry Please help me Isn't this what you wanted to hear from me? Hey! What's left with you after all this? What is it that you want?
