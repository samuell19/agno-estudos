Let me tell you something else, I did some checking up on this house and you should know a couple of things, huh. Number one, 10 years ago tonight, Mr. And Mrs. Hoffman died at a party here, and they couldn't find any buyers for this house. Now there's Cindy, and before that, your uncle. - Wait a minute. Let me have your attention, please. Your attention. 33 and a third. (all cheering) Let's hear it for them, come on. Give it up! Give it up! 33 and a third. Woo! It's gonna be hot night, yes. Let me tell you, our new single is being released, 33 and a third, featuring my superstar, Victoria. Yeah, let's hear it! (all cheering) - [Man 2] Do it Victoria. - This is our hit single. I paid for it, she's doing it. (audience laughing) Break an arm! (bright upbeat music) - Hi, there. What are you doing here all alone, huh? - When was the last time you saw Cindy? - Cindy? - Yeah. - Hi, guys. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you're empty handed. Stay right there and I'll get you a little drink. - Yeah, why don't you? - The last time you saw Cindy? - Oh, Cindy, I think she was going to the beach. - When? - Oh, I don't know. A couple of days ago? - A couple of days ago, like when? Friday, Saturday? - Oh yeah, I'm coming. Hold on. (bright upbeat music) (ominous music) (breathing heavily) - Drink up, boy.

Mellow out, kid, this is a party. - Love you, love you. - [Man 3] Goddam drunk, get out of our way. This guy is messed up. - He's just had too much. (dramatic music) - Um, do you know what I was supposed to bring to the other room? (Pam chuckles) I forgot.

(man groans) (dramatic music) - Oh my God, the house, you know? Maybe he was right. - Daddy, tell me how much you love me, and how you'll never go back to her again. - Are you talking about my wife? Darling, that's a whole another thing. That's... NO, no) no! - No, you must never go back to mother, and let her take me off to that awful place. Do you understand? You must stay here with me forever. (dramatic music) So it is her that you love? Well, I've taken care of mother. (breathing heavily) If you won't give me your heart willingly then I shall take it. And no one else shall ever have it again. (ominous music) If only you would love me, and be mine instead of mommy's. Remember our last party? When mother came upstairs and found us together in her bed? Remember how I took care of her? Why did you have to get angry with me? Now I shall have your heart forever. (ominous music) You see daddy, I have the power. (Debbie laughing) See, daddy? (breathing heavily) - D? Deborah. Deborah Hoffman, that's it. You are Deborah Hoffman, Debbie. - Yes, and you are trespassing. This is my house. (dramatic music) - Oh no, Debra. (monster growling) (Jim groaning) Debbie, no! No! (Debbie laughing hysterically) - Down, to your knees. (monster growls) - The white light, focus. Focus, white light. Focus! - No, daddy said that I was the only one! (Debbie screaming) (sirens wailing) - Oh my God. (monitor beeping) (ominous music)
