Mother? Mother? Sebastian! It's locked. A PLACE IN THE SUN The court has reversed Philip Andersson's conviction. While the initial appeal of the original conviction was sustained, after two years imprisonment, a new appeal was initiated. My client, Philip Andersson was wrongly imprisoned for more than two years. But today, the Supreme Court acquitted Philip of all charges. I'm sure you have many questions. Do you still trust the Swedish legal system? Yes, I'm glad I got a new trial, but I lost three years of my life. That shouldn't happen in a democracy. There's a price to be paid. Will you claim compensation? That's for later consideration. That isn't an unreasonable thought, but at this moment we're satisfied with this. Annika Bengtzon of Evening Press. Can you explain why a lot of the testimony changed? That's a question for the prosecutor. I asked Philip. I'd like to hear his answer. The court found me innocent. That's no answer to the question. Can you say more about changes in the witness statements? You say that more like a fact than as a question. Philip was convicted on the basis of questionable evidence. So you tell me. What's wrong in the legal system? Evening Press Editorial Office Annika, come to my office? What should I do about Philip Andersson? Close the door, please. He can't go unpunished. Annika, I want an answer from you. I said "no". But we agreed that you should think about it. Spike is retiring today. We need a new news editor. I'm happy with my current position. But it's going to disappear. We're just going to have permanent staff reporters from now on. So either you take over as news editor, or you'll have to work according to a schedule. I work best on my own schedule. Annika, you have so much more potential. What should I do about Philip Andersson? All the media were there. It isn't an exclusive. Only a short summary? From what perspective? Do you have proof he's guilty? No. Then he was wrongly convicted. That'll be a short summary. Annika? If you don't want it, I'll assign it to someone else... who'll decide what you write. I'm a journalist, not a personnel manager. What did Schyman say? Nothing new. And you? Nothing new. Pity. You'd be a good boss. How did the press conference go? How does "cleared of all charges" sound? Not really the headline of the year. Hey. Check this out. This just came in. Family dead in a gas break-in in Costa del Sol. Gas break-in? What's that? They pumped gas inside and waited until everyone was unconscious. Is that common? In Costa del Sol it is. My brother has a house there, but I've never heard that anyone would die. Will you take this story? No, I'll do the school bus accident. Annika Bengtzon of Evening Press. Are you Rickard Marmen? Yes. What can I do for you? I'm relaying greetings from Berit. Give her my greetings back. I have a question about the gas burglary last night. Are you in Spain now? Yes. Do you often hear about gas burglaries? We have no other break-ins here. You have fire alarms, we have gas ones. According to my data a family died from that. Died? When? Last night. Was it a Swedish family? I don't know. Do you know any more about it? Only that the whole family died, including two children. I must find out more. Can I reach you at this number? Certainly. Thank you. Cheers to spike! Thank you. Guess what's inside. A football. When I started working here, Spike was already the news editor. I don't know how we'll survive without you. Many of you must be wondering who the new editor will be. So allow me to introduce you to the new editor: Patrik Nilsson. Patrik, go ahead. Thank you. I'm glad to be working with all of you. We'll create a great newspaper. What do we have for tomorrow? I have a bus crash in Sk?ne. Annika? A dead family on the Costa del Sol. Spain? Is there a connection to Sweden? 50,000 Swedes live there. Usually gas burglaries don't result in deaths. And Philip Andersson's press conference? I've a written summary. A summary? This man was wrongly convicted for more than two years and you write a summary? This is what people want to read. It's not an exclusive story. It'll be in the news. "Wrongly Jailed" is always good. "Three years of his life stolen from him." Designated. Dishonored. Innocent. Send it to me. I'll make something beautiful out of it. Excuse me? I won't steal it from you. Your name will appear on the by-line. Next point. Rickard, thanks for your help, but the article didn't go through. What? The gas burglary... You were supposed to drop it. They were Swedes. Sure? It's Sebastian S?derstr?m. Wait, wait, wait... Sebastian S?derstr?m? The hockey star? Jesus. Come here. A year ago I did a special about him. You've found it. This is the World Cup. His career's been put on the back burner, but he still loves sports. I'm not that old. He went from hockey to golf. Does anyone have any news? Only we, from Berit's brother-in-law. Are you sure? The official channels haven't reported it. We put nothing on-line until the newspapers are printed. Sports should locate ex-teammates. Berit, you provide an official comment. Annika, finish up everything. Grab a suitcase. You're off to Malaga as quickly as possible. Is that a problem? No. Good. I wanna know how exactly they died. What leads the police have. Try to make it a bit sexy. Sports? Sophia Grenborg. Hi, Sophia. Is Thomas there? Yes, one moment. Mama, I wanna be with you. I know, sweetheart. You've just been with me all week. A five-day week. I know, but you won't even notice I'm gone. Careful. Don't lose your frog. I hate the frog, and I hate Sophia. Don't say such things. We're pleased we can help. Thanks again. Bye. Hi, Kalle and Ellen. Ellen, say hello to Sophia. She's a little tired. Hello, Daddy. Come see what we bought for you. Shoes off before you come in. It would have been nice to know more than half an hour ahead. I called you as soon as I knew. You and your lousy job. What do you want me to do? Honey, could you just help? Of course. See you. We were the first. Now we have to maintain that advantage. "S?derstr?m's life of luxury". Color it up a bit. Patrik, I've done this before. I know. Find young people to interview. Not just retirees. Have you already got hold of the police? I'm going there now. Call me when you're done. Good? About 200 meters ahead, turn right. At the end of the road, turn right. Yeah, but... About 200 meters ahead, turn right. This can't be it. Now, turn right. But... Please, turn right. I'm still just at the airport. Shut up, stupid thing. Hi, I'm here for Niklas Linde. Would you sign here? Annika Bengtzon? Niklas Linde. I expected you an hour ago. That was the plan, but my GPS didn't cooperate. Welcome to the Costa del Sol, where the diversions change every day. GPS can't cope with it. Have you arranged for a guide. Do you know one? What does a Swedish policeman do in Spain? I maintain contact with the Swedish authorities. It's not really my field, but I manage the contacts. What can I do for you? I need information about the S?derstr?ms. According to my source, a gas alarm is the standard here. Didn't they have one? They did. Was it broken? I'm not directly involved in the matter... but I understand the alarm worked properly. I can check it, though. And the cause of death was gas inhalation? That was the initial assessment. Are there any other indications? A different gas than usual was used. What do you mean? They used fentanyl. What is that? Do you remember when the Russian police invaded the Dubrovka theater? Was that fentanyl? When hundreds of people died. Is it often used by gangs? No. Fentanyl is hard to come by. So they were killed deliberately? We can only speculate about that. Can it be a settling of accounts? I'm going to look for the number of the guide I mentioned. Why would anyone want to kill an ex-hockey player? Was there any threats against him? Are there any clues? Carita Halling-Gonzales, married to a Swede. We usually use her as an interpreter, but I think she'll be willing to assist. I'm Carita. You need a guide? Niklas Linde advised me to call you. Thanks. A small coffee, please. Anything else? Do you want anything? No, I'm fine. That will be all. Thank you. Where were we? I ask 43 euro an hour, plus expenses. Is that okay? What do you mean expenses? Gasoline, if we go in my car. I have my own car. Okay. Then we're good. Did you know the S?derstr?m family? No. Our children went to the same school, but I never met them. A terrible event. So, where are we going? To the house of the S?derstr?m family. Want to go in? Can we? Not if you play with it here. I'll make sure you get in. Wait here. The burglars took everything of value with them. Here is where the family was found. The mother lay near the window. Don't touch anything, please. My condolences. What did he say? That he is sorry. I told him you knew the family. The children's rooms are upstairs. You lied? A journalist would have to pay much more. You bribed him? I charge it as simply "various expenses". This is the children's room. This is the room of the little girl. I think she just wants to be alone. We'll wait downstairs. You must hurry, the investigators will be back. Would you also say goodbye to the older girl? I'm sorry I don't understand. The big girl. You want good bye? The big girl? Yes. Yes, please. This way. Suzette lives here Who is Suzette? There's a teenager's room with "Suzette" on the door. Another child? Suzette S?derstr?m is Sebastian's daughter who lives in Sweden. The room seemed inhabited. How do you know? Do you have her number? Why should I give that? I just want to talk to her. Good luck with that. What a shitty connection. S?derstr?m, like many Swedes, spent a lot of time at the golf club. My knees no longer worked, So I started golf. The internet conection is terrible here. That's normal in all of Spain. I have a Suzette S?derstr?m. Jannike Diana Suzette, 16 years. Do you have her number? I'll look up the address. S?derstr?m, Lenita Marika, 42 years. It's the same address. It could be her mother. Let's see. Four payment records... No phone. I'll see if I can find it here. Have you found out any more? Have you just spoken to Berit? I asked her what to search for. You could have called me. I was busy. What do you have? "Police suspect murder". What? You're kidding. It was no accident. Then we do "The deadly drama, minute by minute". We'll need some pictures? Yes. I took some photos. Good. Was there anyone they knew? Sebastian had a daughter, Suzette. I'm trying to track her down. No, Berit can do that. You should focus on the Swedish colony and family life. I'll go to the golf club tomorrow. It's a meeting place for Swedes. Good. Try to arrange a minute's silence. I'll see what's planned. Push them. Ask why it hasn't happened. That always works for me. I should demand a minute's silence? Yes, you should. You can do it. Call me when it's over. Excuse me, what's going on here? We're commemorating the S?derstr?m family. That bastard. Let people mourn for the money they won't get back. Members, guests, friends from the press. Sebastian S?derstr?m was a role model, a good friend and colleague. I ask you all to join me in one minute's silence for... Sebastian, Veronica, My and Leo. Thank you for coming. Was that a minute? Hello, Carita. Rickard. As beautiful as ever. Rickard Marmen. Annika Bengtzon. We've already spoken on the phone. Nice to finally meet you. Sebastian S?derstr?m... People seem angry at him. Why? Shall we sit down? I'll get something to drink. There was always something with Sebastian. What do you mean? He wanted to do something new, so he started a number of projects here. People believed in his success, but he wasn't a good businessman. He swindled money from people? Only rich people. No, seriously. I think he didn't expressly do that. He wanted to introduce a new sport: Stick ball. Ever heard of it? Never. Just like everyone else. I think a lot of people lost money through his projects. Can someone have been angry enough to murder him? Who knows? It wasn't like people knew he hadn't invested his own money. Why not? They seem to have been rich. Seem to, yes. But Sebastian had no money. Only his wife worked. Veronica was a lawyer. Why didn't anyone talk about Suzette, Sebastian's eldest daughter? She didn't really belong to the family. We never saw her. They were never all together. Does anyone know any more about that? You can try Vibeke Jensen. She's Danish. She runs a riding school in Cancelada. Near San Pedro? I know her. Hello. Is anyone there? Shit. You can wait in the car. You sure? I can do without an interpreter here. Let me know if you need help. Can I help you? Vibeke Jensen? Yes. Hi. Annika Bengtzon. I'm looking for Suzette S?derstr?m. You're writing about the accident? Yes, I'm looking for information on the family. Everyone could see something wasn't right. What do you mean? They fought a lot, she and her stepmother, Veronica. They quarreled? Yes. She's come to live here when it was too much for her. I offered her a job. She was supposed to start last week. Was she in Spain last week? Yes. She called me the morning she was supposed to start. She said she changed her mind and was going back to her mother in Stockholm. It was her own decision, but it was quite unexpected. In hindsight I'm glad she went home. Did you talk to her afterwards? No. Can I have her number? No. Or the number of her mother? I just want to ask some questions. Suzette doesn't need to know about it if you don't want. Okay. Hello? Can I Speak to Lenita? I'm Annika Bengtzon of Evening Press. Sorry about your ex-husband. Can I ask you some questions? I've nothing to say. May I speak to Suzette? She's not here now. When does she come back? She's in Spain, at a riding school. Vibeke Jensen's? Yes. I'm there now. Suzette isn't here. What is it? I thought Suzette was in Sweden. No, she's in Spain, at the riding school. Wait. Vibeke, I think you just need to talk to her mother. Vibeke Jensen here. Isn't Suzette at your place? No. Suzette S?derstr?m is missing. The local police informed Interpol, and they contacted us again. What do we do now? Of course we'll do our best. We'll check phone, passport, and bank accounts to fill in the gaps. If she's here somewhere, we'll find her. There is no indication that Suzette left Spain. I still have no decent internet here. Can you find out more about Suzette? Gas Murder. "Sportsman's daughter missing, after family deaths." Get that straight. The search has revealed nothing. Suzette had a blog. Okay, wait a minute... Thank you. Come. I'm Polly. That's me. Why didn't Suzette return to Sweden? To her mom? She's crazy. Why did she do that to Vibeke? She's neither here nor there. Where can she be? You're her best friend. No idea. The whole family's dead, and she doesn't return my calls. When did you talk to her? Last week, via SMS. When? Monday, I think. She said her phone was broken and told me not to worry. But that was before all this happened. It's making me uneasy. Can I have her number? Yes, but it's turned off. I can always try. She tells her mother she's at Vibeke's. And Vibeke claims she went home. Has she run away? Doesn't seem so. Why not? She disappeared two days before the murder. She's had a week or so to get in touch and hasn't used her passport. There must be some trace of her? I've got something you might find interesting. These are two of the men who broke into S?derstr?m's. They were found dead in their car. In our view, they're Romanians. How did they die? Overdose. Morphine. It was in their beer bottles. Who did that? We don't know. We have traces of two cars and three people. We don't know who the third was. Everything except the contents of the safe was found in their car. Was that everything they took? Everything seems to point to that. I want an article in Evening Press. Pardon? Not about this. About something else. I don't write anything on request. Did you think this was free? And what if it's a good story? No, my boss isn't happy because I didn't give him enough local color. Come with me tonight. Bring your camera along. I'll let you see the surroundings. If you want to write about it, that's up to you. Please. A nice gesture from the Spanish police. Last week a truck full of cocaine left for Stockholm. Tonight another one departs. So I have to write about two intercepted trucks? No, we let the first go. But not tonight. Why do you want me to write the article? We're trying to smoke out a Swedish cop, but he's on his guard. If he gets wise to this, he'll disappear, and we can begin again. But a boastful article can help us lure him out in the open. So you want him to think you only knew about one truck? Spanish drug seizures aren't news. But we'll nab the courier. That makes no difference. Even if he's Swedish? We don't know if there will be any security or if he comes alone. Good? How do you know about tonight? We tapped his phone. What's his name? The courier? Johan Zarco Martinez, aka Jocke. He's 26, born in Sweden. Understood. The truck is secured, so just wait. You should get in the car. And stay there. Hey you. You there. What are you doing? Give me that phone. Give me. Give me that camera, dammit. Police. Easy. Shut up and lie still. Swedish? I'm a Swedish citizen. What's this about? I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I told you I'm Swedish. No photos. Okay? Yes. Will I get my article? I don't know. That's not up to me. Know what? We'll have a beer. It won't get the front page. I don't know what my new boss is thinking. People seem to be promoted based on their incompetence, and that applies to Patrik. What? Continue. What is it? Continue. Do you talk about other things than work? Do I do that too much? What do you wanna talk about? Annika here. This is exactly what I meant. "The dark side of luxury lifestyle". "Cocaine Coast." A whole series. We can create a whole series of articles, but the pictures won't do the features. I'm sending a photographer early morning tomorrow. And hey, Bengtzon... Good job. But you... They'll take the article. We're a good team. Good morning. Annika. Have you received my mail? Good morning to you too. I have a new idea: "Cocaine Coast, the villain and the hero." Can you interview that courier? I think so. I have a good informant. I'll just catch that hero. It's all arranged. A conference on drugs opens today in Malaga. You'll interview an expert. What's his name? I'll text you his name. And then Suzette? Cocaine Coast is your story. There's a 16-year-old girl missing. We've already written about that. I'll send a photographer. You pick her up at the airport. Who? Lotta. She's new. I couldn't get anyone else on short notice. She's not a temporary worker? It'll work out just fine. Thanks, Patrik... Are you Lotta? I'm Annika. You have a lot of stuff with you. Is the hotel far away? One hour. But we won't go there. I have to charge my flash. We have an interview in 3/4 of an hour. Is it such a tight schedule? Niklas scheduled it. We have only five minutes. And no cameras. Why was I sent then? Don't you have a small camera then? This is unethical. You shouldn't bring anything inside. I don't like to impose myself on others. Please, only one wide angle picture. "A Swede sits locked up here." I'm the photographer. Who are you? What is this? This is Annika Bengtzon, journalist. Damn, it's you. You took those pictures of me. I write articles for Evening Press... I won't talk to you. They'll think I talked. It can be anonymous. You can't write about me. I need to get out of here. I can tell your story. My story? Are you crazy? That only makes it worse. What? Why what? They will... They'll come to kill me. Who? Who do you think? The people who you work for? Who are they? Do you use drugs yourself? Do you wanna talk about my childhood? I'm not a junkie. Get me out of here. Hey, take it easy. Help me, for fuck's sake. They'll murder me just like the S?derstr?m family. I can't be in here. The S?derstr?m family? Didn't you hear me? Sebastian... Did you know him? Is that why he was murdered? If you tell me now, I'll do everything to help you. Get me out and I'll tell you. Was S?derstr?m involved in drugs? Not that I know of. What's this about? Where are you? I need to talk to you. I'm at a conference on drugs in Malaga. You're kidding. I have a interview in half an hour, but can you meet me in the lobby in fifteen minutes? It wasn't easy to get a good picture. But I did it. Look. Where is the prison? Don't you see? Behind these men. The article is about a Swedish guy who made contact with the wrong people and ended up in hell on earth. What's that got to do with these men playing chess? I can't just shoot the building. You should put something in the foreground to create perspective. You want to come with me. Hello. Was Sebastian involved in drugs? Jocke talked about him. What'd he say? He said they'd murder him... like they did with the S?derstr?m family. Annika? Thomas? What are you doing here? You have the children. They're with Sophia. You could have said you were going somewhere. You just left them with me. Still, you could have told me. I'm here for a conference. I'm supposed to meet with a journalist, and... that's you, apparently. Are you the hero who Patrik found? Hero? I can't interview you. Yes, that would be uncomfortable. Niklas Linde. Narcotics. He works here. Thomas. Niklas. So... Do you have time to talk? Of course. Good luck with that conference. Who was that? My ex-husband. Jocke said something. Well, he wrote it. APITS. Any idea what that might be? APITS? That's the warehouse where we picked him up. I'd like to go there. Well, I'm done here. We can go in my car. Is that your photographer? Evening Press's. You can have her. I prefer journalists. Here stood the truck. Beautiful surroundings. This is a company called APITS Dep?sito. APITS Transporte is the owner of the truck. Who's the owner of APITS? It's registered in Gibraltar, but Gibraltar has no registry. It doesn't? That's why this part of Europe is so attractive to smugglers. Gibraltar and Morocco are close, and the coast isn't well guarded. Excuse me. This is a crime scene. You can't touch anything. Sorry. I'll work around it. Does APITS do anything else? No. Can I quote you? No. I want to remain anonymous. How about: Sources at the Spanish police. That's perfect. I didn't expect to find anything good on the Costa del Sol. Good. Thank you. It's a profession, but I wouldn't do it the rest of my life. Photography is art. It's more real than journalism. Newspapers retell other people's experiences. They create nothing. But art touches people. What a load of crap. So the news has never touched you? Only seniors playing chess? What are you doing here? It was a bit weird just now. I wanted to know how you were doing. What? My boss asked for the interview. What do you say? What? Let's go eat? I'm busy. I have to figure out how the gangs launder drug money. Maybe another time. Have you considered asking an economist who works with drug laws, and who's inviting you for dinner? It's very simple. You want a receipt of where the money comes from... So you must sell something. Anything? In theory, yes. In Sweden, the restaurant industry has a free hand because it's impossible to check how many drinks you've sold. But here it's even easier. Property. Houses are very expensive. Sell a few houses, and you can easily declare that money. Some houses are bought... And sold again. Back and forth without the residents moving. Why isn't this sector under the microscope? Why are companies registered in Gibraltar. They have no records. There's nothing to see. I had no idea you knew this. You never asked. Hi, Kalle. Very good. What? Yes. I think there's someone here you want to speak to. Hello, sweetheart. Mama? I miss you. Me too. Is Ellen there? She's asleep. You should go to bed too. Are you going to marry Daddy? No... I won't marry Dad again. Go to bed. I love you. I love you too. Kisses. Bye. It was fun. No, I can't. Goodnight. They'll come to kill me. I can't be in here. Help me, for fuck's sake. S?derstr?m - drugs? What was in the safe? We're trying to smoke out a Swedish cop, but he's on his guard. We're an hour away from Morocco. Most of Europe's hashish is produced there. Who's the owner of APITS? It's registered in Gibraltar, but Gibraltar has no registry. That's why companies are registered there. No administration. Hello, Rickard, I'm Annika Bengtzon. I'm looking for a Swedish lawyer working in real estate in Gibraltar. Do you happen to know anyone? Yes, but she's now dead. Who? Veronica S?derstr?m. I think I told you. Hello? She had an office in Gibraltar? Yes, that's right. OK, thank you. Anytime. Niklas here. It was Veronica who had drug connections, not Sebastian. She had an agency in Gibraltar called "A Place In The Sun". A-P-I-T-S. You have a visitor. Veronica's office was a front company. Her own house was for sale. I'll check into Veronica S?derstr?m. Good. Look for a link with APITS carrier. A-P-I-T-S. I'll call you when I have something. Wait. Someone called. Polly Sandman? Polly? She was supposed to call me if she heard from Suzette. I received an e-mail. I couldn't contact the police. I'm sure it's her. Suz is alive. And Fatima, who is that? Her second mother. She has a riding school where Suz often spends the summer. Look. Suz has her own horse there. Is that Fatima? Yes. Where is that riding school? Polly? Asilah. The riding school is in Asilah. Is that close by? It's in Morocco. Carita here. Leave a message. Carita, I found Suzette in Morocco, in a place owned by a woman called Fatima. I don't know exactly where, but I want to go there tomorrow. Call me back. Of course. Thank you. I'll take care of it. Yes. I found Suzette. Sit down. She's in Morocco. Polly said... When did you talk to Carita? I just got a message from her. Jocke Martinez is dead. He was found dead in his cell. How? A overdose. Morphine. How did he get that? I thought you might know. Me? How? Only you and Carita saw him. Five minutes only. What did Carita say? Barely anything. We spoke in Swedish. Did you know she had an appointment today with Jocke? Today? Carita was just with him. She was on the list, so she was admitted. She arrived at 13.05. Jocke was brought down to the visiting room. We think she bribed the guards to be allowed into his cell. She left at 13:20. At 14:15... Jocke was discovered dead in his cell. Carita must have given him the morphine. I'm going to Sweden? Seriously? Jocke died from an overdose like the two Romanian burglars. Do you think there's a connection? We think Carita has something to do with the murder of the S?derstr?m family. Why? We think she was the third person. Who did she work for? Someone in the drug trade. Why would she do it? Blackmail, threats, or money. Yes? It's arranged. I told her where Suzette is. The girl? Is she at the stables? Yes. I can't do anything else. Bye. I'll call the Moroccan authorities. It can take a long time. We're going now. You can't expect me to just get on a boat to Morocco. Are you aware of the consequences? Now you care about the rules suddenly. I got you inside that prison. It's my responsibility. Do you know how much trouble that caused? You can't write about it. I don't care about the story. We need to find Suzette. Leave it to me and my Spanish colleagues. I'll find out what happened to Jocke Martinez. You stay here. My colleague will interrogate you later. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. It's me. Do you have anything? Hello? I can't hear you. Hello? Where are you? Is that Annika? Bad connection. Give me that. Sorry... Why don't you answer when I call? I'm busy. Can I call you back? Lotta says you have left. I hope you have a good story. Hello. The connection is very bad. I'll call as soon as I can. Yes? Who's there? I'm Annika Bengtzon. I'd like to speak to Fatima. I'd also like to speak to Suzette. I just want to talk, nothing more. Open the door. Stop. Your bag. Give me that bag. Camera, phone, passport. Come on. Move. Over there. Stay there. Are you Fatima? Take her to the guesthouse. Take her. Fast. Please, madam. Keep moving. Here it is. Suzette? Is it true that you write for a newspaper? Why are you here? I wanted to see if you were here. Are you okay? They can't keep you. You have to leave. Nobody holds me here. I want to stay here. Do you know what this place is? How did you come here without a passport? Fatima has her own boats. She doesn't go through customs. Everyone is looking for you. Nobody cares. They think I'm too expensive and get in the way. Only Fatima cares about me. She was afraid that this would happen if that man was released. She just wants to protect me. Who? Someone Veronica and Fatima did business with. But your father and Veronica decided to stay? Veronica's ice cold. She had an "insurance". He couldn't do anything because of the papers. He thought Veronica had them at home, but they weren't there. Fatima has them. You know what happened to them? Yes, I wrote about that in the newspaper. They were so small and so cute. What are you doing here? Fatima doesn't want you to be here. Out. Don't be afraid of Fatima. Go. Go. Get lost, asshole. Open the gate. Do it now! Open. Open it. I have no key. Don't kill me. No, please. No, no. No, please. What are you doing here? Evening Press can reveal Suzette is still alive... Suzette? Will you write about this? Only if you want. I want my mother to know I'm okay. And Polly. But don't say where I am. Suzette decided to stay. There will be a price to be paid. The police have strong evidence linking the so-called luxury assassin... Carita Halling-Gonzales... ASSASSIN ARRESTED WHY JOCKE WAS KILLED Are you sure you don't want to come home with me? I want to stay here. SWEDISH DRUG ORGANIZATION DISMANTLED IN SPAIN What is that? Our new photographer has won a prize. Did you hire Lotta? Yes. You didn't want to be the editor. You're a journalist.
