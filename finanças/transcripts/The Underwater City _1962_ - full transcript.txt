MALE NARRATOR: The sea, more than any other realm of life, has fired the imagination of mankind since the dawn of history. Knowledge of the oceans is more than a matter of curiosity. Our very survival may hinge on it. We are merely on the threshold of exploring the world of inner space. Now man, in his attempt to gain further knowledge is returning to the ancestral home of all living things, the sea. The Manta Ray, a specially designed hydro jet submarine vehicle with the capacity to hold a dozen people, is carrying a group of oceanographers to a previously selected site where they will mark the spot for the first permanent colony of mankind to be established on the ocean floor. They will also measure and check the ocean currents, as oceanographers believe these undersea rivers hold the secrets of weather. If we can learn to control these currents, we may someday be able to control the world's climate. A conversion of saltwater to drinking water is another project vital to an ever growing world population, as is the gathering of information to locate the source and trace the path of tidal waves. Dr. Junius Halstead, a dedicated scientist, an oceanographer and leader of the group, directs his men to investigate the surrounding area in accordance with their previously planned studies and instructions. The men proceed with their given tasks as Dr. Carl Wendt, Halstead's longtime associate and geologist of the group, assembles his depth gauge, current-measuring vane, mallet and rope, and moves off alone according to plan in the direction leading to the edge of an undersea precipice. He and the other men carry a sonar alarm, a miniaturized warning device operated by a push button for sending high frequency alarm signals through the water. His task is to examine the crust and rock structure on the bottom and measure the currents at the cliff edge. Dr. Halstead and his men select the spots where their future equipment will be secured, while Wendt now checks the sand on the sea floor. The oceanographers measure the proper space for the units to come and then head for the previously marked center point of the project. As Dr. Wendt moves slowly towards the precipice, his foot suddenly sinks into the bottom, almost tripping him. The bottom crumbles, sinking almost like quicksand at his touch. He walks on to the very point where the ocean floor drops thousands of feet to the undisturbed depths of a trench, and where a swift current as fast as a mighty river, but much faster, rises up from the depths. He unfastens his current gauge and releases the vanes. The propeller blade begins rapidly whirling and he takes a reading from the needle gauge. The needle points to 10 knots. But Wendt must investigate further to gain vital information about the current in the trench. He proceeds to lower himself deeper into the trench over the edge of the precipice into the unknown depths below. (SCREAMS) (ALARM BEEPING) As the high frequency alarm system comes through the water, the men react and head for the cliff. (SCREAMING) As Dr. Halstead and his men come to the edge of the precipice, all they can see and hear is the raging current below. They can but mourn the loss of another dedicated scientist who has given his life for mankind. (INTERCOM BUZZING) Yes. SECRETARY: Mr. Gage is here. Send him in. (LAUGHING) Congratulations, Tim. You know, by golly, I didn't think we'd be able to swing it. You know, we've been working nights, and I think we've solved enough basic problems to save at least six months. Yeah, but that's fine... For instance, we've cut the overall requirements down to 16 rocket payloads, 20 at the odd site. Now, incidentally, here's a pressure suit that I've gimmicked up. (CHUCKLING) Yeah, well, now slow down, Bob. What's the matter? Something wrong? Your wire said we had a contract. A contract. Not the contract. What do you mean? We're not building the space station. We aren't? Nobody is. No, there's too many safety problems. So the agency has tabled it indefinitely. But your wire said we have a contract. We have a contract. We have a contract to build this. What is this? A gag? No, this is real. An underwater city. Underwater city? You mean people living at the bottom of the ocean? Well, not a city at first. Just a small, permanent colony to prove the idea is feasible. Well, do you think it is? Well, why not? Submarines can do it. Atomic submarines can stay down as long as their food holds out. Sure, sure, the ocean bottom is a great place to visit, but who wants to live there? Oh, I don't know and I don't care. All I know is that we've got the contract to build this underwater city. Graham and Company. This will mean the big leagues, Bob. No more bush stuff for those dirty little subcontracts that decent construction men won't take. The reason we got this contract to build this city is you. Me? That's right. You're the only top construction engineer in the business with underwater demolition experience. The moment they looked up your Navy frogman record, we were in. Deep. Deeper than you know. I put myself in hock practically for the rest of my life in order to prove enough credit to swing this. So, all right, when do we start? Oh, why not right now? Let's go over and see Dr. Junius Halstead. The oceanographer? Yeah. The head of the Halstead Institute. He's the man responsible for this underwater subdivision. Maybe we can get him to sell you a seaweed covered cottage. (CHUCKLING) Let's go. Yeah. HALSTEAD: Outer space may be more glamorous at the moment, makes bigger headlines. But in terms of destiny of mankind, the future, inner space, the undersea world, is infinitely more important than outer space can ever be. I take it that you don't believe in the future of interplanetary travel, Doctor. I believe anything that increases the sum total of human knowledge is important. And space travel will certainly do that. But... But in terms of vital significance to our immediate and foreseeable future, no comparison, none whatever. Well, that's what makes horse racing. You're not impressed. Impressed? The idea that my future depends on people living at the bottom of the sea like fish? Who wouldn't be? Bob, please. I wonder, in view of the way Mr. Gage feels, wouldn't it be better to... To get somebody else? (LAUGHING) I wouldn't worry, Dr. Halstead. He may not be thrilled with what he's doing, but I guarantee you, he'll get the job done. Right? Well, we'll give it a good try. Frankly, I'd prefer someone with more enthusiasm. But rather than delay now, I'll... I'll accept your judgment. Good. (INTERCOM BUZZING) Yes? MAN: The Coast Guard just phoned. They think they have Dr. Wendt's body. Thank you. Bring Dr. Powers in the building. Make an appointment for an examination of Mr. Gage. (CHUCKLING) For me, why? I'm in great shape. Everyone participating in this project must have a complete examination. The work is extremely hazardous. It's already cost the life of our geologist, Carl Wendt. Yeah, well, he'll see the doctor. (INTERCOM BUZZING) Yes? MAN: Dr. Alan on two. I'll take the call in my lab. Excuse me, gentlemen. One life. Before this pipe dream is finished they'll kill a dozen, maybe more. Well, is that why you're trying to blow the job before we even get started? Blow it? You practically told Dr. Halstead he was off his rocker. Well, I'm sorry, Tim. Remember, we only build the city, we don't have to live in it. So do me a favor, will you, just soft-pedal how you really feel. Well, it sounds like a reasonable request, boss. Good. POWERS: Come in. Mr. Gage? Yes. Would you remove your jacket, please, and, uh, sit over there? Yes, of course. Will Dr. Powers be long? I'm Dr. Powers. You? Anything wrong? Oh, no. No. Your bedside manner must be pretty terrific. Mr. Gage, the fact that I'm female has been an obstacle, but in spite of that I've managed to become a good doctor. Oh, now, look... So therefore, sex need have no affect whatever on the doctor-patient relationship. If you say so, Doc. You can fill out this medical history later. Hold this. Oh, you're going to check my answers, huh? What? It is a lie detector, isn't it? Oh, yes, a polygraph. But that's not what we use it for. Your various patterns are very useful clues in predicting spontaneous stress reactions. Mmm-hmm, you're a psychologist, too, eh? Psychologist primarily. Oh, I see. How do you apply these clues? Well, we try to detect any susceptibility to claustrophobia to anticipate the effects of confined underwater existence on the minds and bodies of our colonizers. That won't bother me any, I'm not going to live in the city. Well, you'll no doubt be underwater for extended periods building it. Where does he get them? Where does who get what? Dr. Halstead and the human flounders that volunteer. (LAUGHS) Why do they want to? Well, I don't know about the other flounders. I know why I'm doing it. You? Because I believe in it. Because I think it's terribly important, and possibly because Dr. Halstead is my uncle. Oh. Please, try to control your reactions. You'll upset our calibrations. I said you'll have to control your reactions. I didn't say a word. MALE NARRATOR: Shortly after passing his test, project engineer Bob Gage assembled a team of underwater experts and put the project into high gear. You know, when you put up a house, you pick a site, lay a foundation and go ahead and build. But with Amphibia City, we're going to do it backwards. We'll build our house on land. No site, no foundation. Then the roof goes on, we seal the unit tightly, big gantry lifts it up, puts it in the water, we tow it out to sea and sink it into place. Doctor, if you will, please. Now, here are the engineering sections of the self-leveling piling supports. They'll adjust to variations in the sea bottom or any other stress. I wish you'd study these plans very carefully. Oh, and one other detail, we'll use lead soles instead of fins. They'll lose part of their weight in the water. Like all heavy metal under water. That's right. It will allow us to work and walk easier at the sea bottom. Now, are there any questions? Yes. Communications. Won't there be a problem under water? Well, we had problems before, but not now we hope. We'll talk into a throat mic. The voice tones will be converted into a light beam, then the listener unit will pick up the light beam, convert it back into sound, and that will be piped into our helmet earphones. Now, if there are no more questions, I'll see you all on the boat in the morning. Uh, Dr. Halstead, this is George Burnett, our geo-physical engineer. How are you, George? How do you do? He's replacing Dr. Wendt. How do you feel now? You mean, how do I feel about Mr. Gage by this time? I must confess, I'm impressed. He certainly seems to know what he's about. A man who can get things done. Yeah, well, I wouldn't steer you wrong. I would have everything to lose and nothing to gain. Yes, I'm sure. (BOTH LAUGHING) Say, Commander. Commander? I haven't heard that since I was in Korea. (EXCLAIMS) You're the cowboy. (LAUGHS) That's right. Chuck Marlow. Cowboy. You weren't much at punching cattle, but you could sure round up a drink any time, any place. Well, I fouled up a couple of times. Didn't you have enough swimming as a frogman? Joined up again, huh? Well, you know, this outfit pays a lot better. Well, believe me, we'll all earn our money. Glad to have you aboard. But belay that commander stuff, will you? Aye, aye, sir. MALE NARRATOR: In addition to the engineers and technicians on the surface, another group headed by Bob Gage is on its way to the underwater site of Amphibia City aboard the Manta Ray. Once on the bottom, the survey and construction crew set about their work locating and emplacing the piling supports, just as they might have done on a surface project. But this one is 30 fathoms deep, where life is at a premium. With constant danger from sharks, giant rays, other monsters of the deep and the perils of the ocean itself. They reach the spot previously marked by a stone, a chain and a small marker buoy. Where one of the engineers sets up his equipment while another unlimbers a tripod with an encased camera to photograph the site. The chain is removed and the marker buoy rises toward the surface as a guide to the engineers above to the spot where the first cell is to come down. Accidents are part of construction. You can do your best to control them, but you cannot eliminate them. I'm glad you're both here. I'd like you to meet our dietician, Phyllis Gatewood. How do you do? How do you do? This is our project engineer, Bob Gage. How do you do? You don't look very happy, Mr. Gage. I'm not. We just had another man killed by sharks. Oh, I'm sorry. But I suppose on anything as important as... (SCOFFS) Important. Mr. Gage isn't exactly a true believer in Amphibia City. I don't understand. Why, I think this is a challenge of a lifetime. Mr. Gage, today millions of people in the world don't get enough to eat. What happens tomorrow, in 10 years, when the population explosion doubles the number? How do we nourish ourselves? The sea is our only hope of avoiding mass starvation. Why, it's a vast, untapped, abundant source of food. But we have to learn how to use it, and that's where I come in. Careful, Miss Gatewood, you're beginning to sound like me. And one mad scientist is enough for Mr. Gage. (LAUGHS) MALE NARRATOR: By the time Bob Gage and his men have completed the piling supports, many parts of the cell units have been fabricated and assembled, moving platforms and other units towed out to sea and some parts are being lowered into the depths. Now the first of the city's large complete cells has been towed to the site and waits to be sunk into place. On the bottom, Bob and his crew are ready to mount the beehive-like housing structure and its self-adjusting hydraulic piling supports. (OVER MIC) This is Gage. She's coming down nice and slow and level. Just hold it like that. Pull in. The currents got it. I can't do it. Not enough pressure. Something's wrong. Number two wench man, you're letting down too fast. Stay still and hold left. This is Number Two. I've got a burning clutch up here. You've got to hold it. We'll lose the cell. This clutch is ready to fly to pieces any second. All right, all of you, the cable's slipping off the track. Grab anything, guide it, we'll try to hoist it in by hand. Chuck, hold it. Chuck, I said hold it. Right. Guide it. Easy. MALE NARRATOR: Despite the near mishap, the first cell unit of Amphibia City is safely in place on the sea floor. Well, the structures are all on the bottom and tied down. Turbo generator is tied in to the ocean current. We have lights and plenty of extra power. Atmosphere recharger and saltwater conversion filter are operational. It seems like we're ready to proceed. (LAUGHS) I guess so. You're one month ahead of schedule. We aren't going too fast for you, are we, Doctor? We have all our personnel selected and screened. The project plans have been ready a long time. I've been preparing for this all my life, remember. (INTERCOM BUZZING) Yes? MAN: There's a Lieutenant Steele to see you. Send him in. He's the last of our company. Dr. Halstead, how are you, sir? Good to see you, Lieutenant. Lieutenant Steele is an underwater communications specialist assigned to us by the Navy. The Navy? We've worked together before on research projects. This is Bob Gage. Bob. How do you do? Tim Graham. How do you do? And my niece, Dr. Powers. Doctor, nice to meet you. How do you do? Sit down, Lieutenant. Yes, the admiral thinks that Dr. Halstead's project may be the vital link in our whole chain of sea defenses. Today control of the seas means control beneath the surface. Uh-huh. Guided missile atomic submarines. Right. But in order for them to do the job, we need an early warning line on the bottom to detect and identify possible enemy subs. And a string of Amphibia cities could do the job perfectly. They might also serve as a home base for our subs, supplying and repairing them all underwater so they'd never have to surface at all. You know, I hate to admit it, what he's saying makes sense. (CHUCKLES) Then the project isn't completely crazy. Yeah, I guess not. Of course, the cells are ready, but we're not in them yet. We're not living on the bottom. We will be, tomorrow. I see no reason for delay. Does anyone? Good. Then early in the morning we'll board the Manta and head for our new home. Now, if the rest of you will run along, I have a lot of work to do. Nice to have met you, Lieutenant. And you, sir. Goodbye. Goodbye. See you, Lieutenant. Bob. Dr. Halstead, I'd like to talk to you alone. Certainly. If you wait just a moment. Alan, it's Dr. Halstead. Tomorrow's the day. Alert the staff. I'll meet with you in a few minutes, and we'll go over everything. Yes, it is. It's hard for me to believe even yet. Now, remind me to thank the admiral for sending you with us again. That's the point, sir. This time I can't go with you. I don't understand. The admiral was sure you'd jump at this chance. The way you talked, as though you believed in it. Oh, I do believe in it, sir. I think the assignment is just great, but... (SIGHS) I got married yesterday. Oh, I see. I postponed the day so many times... Well, I'm not going to let her down now. This time we're going to have a honeymoon. A real honeymoon. A honeymoon. What kind of a girl is your wife? Aside from being the most wonderful girl in the world, of course. That she is. Dotty's father was a Navy man. She's a good sport, game for anything. Game for anything. Even a honeymoon on the bottom of the ocean? Do you mean that? (LAUGHING) Can I use your phone? By all means. Room 12, please. Hello, Dotty. Wally. No, no, no trouble. Listen, what are you doing? I mean, are you standing up or... Well, you better sit down. Now, do you have a good grip on the phone? Good, then... Guess where we're going to spend our honeymoon? MALE NARRATOR: The next day the Manta Ray, with the advance party of ocean floor pioneers, was on its way to Amphibia City. (SONAR PINGING) We've picked up Amphibia's sonar pings. That light up ahead, do you see it? That's Amphibia City. Happy you decided to join us, Mrs. Steele. Well, it's quite an experience. (ALARM BLARING) GAGE: (ON RADIO) Open escape valves, start air pumps, equalize pressure for 30 fathoms. (CHATTERING) (EXCLAIMS) I can't believe it. (WOMEN LAUGHING) Hello, Jimmy. Hi, Mack. The, uh... The boys will take care of your luggage. This cell is built in three levels. The hangar level, below us the main floor and the dining level. The elevator connects all three. POWERS: Oh, it's marvelous. (ALL CHATTERING) Oh, it's wonderful. It's amazing. Just wonderful. Oh, this is miraculous. Isn't it beautiful? How does it feel, Dr. Halstead, seeing a dream come true? It's the greatest moment of my life. If... If I remember the plans correctly, that's the window. That's right. Would you like to see the view? I'd love to. Well, of course. Oh, it's breathtaking, isn't it? Isn't it beautiful? Oh, it's wonderful. GATEWOOD: Isn't it beautiful? (GASPS) It's miraculous. I've never seen anything like this. It's too bad Mr. Graham isn't here to share this with us. Yes, he went to Washington to try and talk the defense department into sharing some of their money with Graham Construction. If he was here, I would tell Mr. Graham how foolish all of my doubts concerning his unenthusiastic project engineer seem to be now. Well, that's very nice of you, Doctor. At least we... We got it on the bottom for you. Now it behooves us to prove the truth of Ralph Waldo Emerson's words. "He builded better than he knew:." "The conscious stone to beauty grew." Would you like to see the rest of the place? Why, yes. Oh, yes. (CLEARING THROAT) Well, Doctor, we'll... We'll start with your office and laboratory. Fine. There's something that'll interest you, Phyllis. The kitchen. The breathing and diving equipment room and exit hatch are below. They're reached by either stairs or elevators. Communications, electronics are in the tower. Now, each unit is self-contained. It has its own emergency power and atmosphere regenerator. You know, actually, the whole installation is fail safe. Fail safe? Mmm-hmm. In case of an accident or an emergency water-tight doors close automatically and each unit seals itself off from the others. Doctor! Oh, your kitchen! Do you like it? It's more than a kitchen. It's a dietician's paradise. Thanks to Mr. Gage here. Thank you, it's perfect, just perfect. Well, you designed it, I just put it together. Yes, but, well, it's... It's more than I expected. Why, we're going to make seaweed the specialty of the house and it's going to be delicious. (LAUGHING) You can check the bulletin board for your assigned living quarters. Oh, yes, all except for Lieutenant Steele and his wife. For them we've reserved the honeymoon cottage. WALLY: Oh, wow. (LAUGHING) Don't be ridiculous, Wally, put me down. Now, who's being ridiculous? (SIGHS) Our first home. Well, I've always known that life wouldn't be exactly normal married to a sailor. But I never quite expected this. But you did expect this. Well... Well... Well, what? It's nice to know that some things about honeymoons haven't changed. You can bet your frog flippers they haven't. And the first rule is... Privacy. MALE NARRATOR: As the months passed, Amphibia City moved rapidly ahead. Oh, Doctor, we're ready for a test run on the TV monitors. Do you want to check them out? I certainly do. You know, with these cameras, we'll be able to check the progress of the work parties without putting on diving suits and equipment. Also, in case of an emergency, we'll be able to send help pretty quickly. MALE NARRATOR: The agar farms provide the source for vegetable matter. The scientists could see a general picture of the rows of experimental beds, or move in to check them in detail. Two-man miniature submarines and aqua bats are used for fast transportation. These mini subs are also used for the fish round up. Nutritious food fishes are selected, rounded up exactly as cowboys round up cattle. The school instinct keeps the fish together. The school is merely pointed in the desired direction, the gates of the fish pen are opened and the fish are confined inside to be fattened like beef. The mini sub circles away and the fish round up is complete. We've got yeast and a little cornmeal here. Pineapple juice, one half pint. That's enough of that. (SNIFFING) Cook for una hour. I thought so. So, this is what happened to my supplies. Oh, now, come on, honey. Don't worry... If you weren't getting enough to eat, why didn't you tell me? You didn't have to steal. I've been getting enough to eat, but... But this is... Oh, now I understand, this is a still. You're right. I got this mash recipe from a woman in the Philippines. They call it "tuba" and this stuff packs a wallop like a 16-inch gun. Wait till you taste it. Not me. And you'd better get this mash cleaned up before Dr. Halstead sees it, or you'll be heading top side, pronto. Now, what's the matter with a thirsty guy wanting a little blast now and then? Nothing. Except that liquor is against the rules down here. You've got everything else. Well, not quite everything. But that's easily fixed. Huh? Isn't it? Huh? (LAUGHS) Oh, no, you don't. Phyllis, just a minute. Phyllis, wait. Phyllis? I got this. (EXCLAIMING) No... We are now generating our own power, creating our own atmosphere, purifying our water, eating our own foods, mining our own minerals. In short, we have achieved our objective. As of this moment we can say that our undersea colony, Amphibia City, is complete, self-contained and independent of the surface. We've met all our needs and... Almost all, Doctor. My wife's about ready to take care of the last one. Well, I... I'm not sure whether it will have gills or lungs, but I'm pretty sure it'll be a baby. (ALL CHATTERING) Well, congratulations, Mrs. Steele. You, too, Lieutenant. Well, that about concludes the report. Meeting adjourned? Right. Congratulations. Bob, I assume you've been thinking of the day when we would become self-sufficient. Oh, yes. I've given the day some thought. It means my job down here is finished. Have you considered staying on with us, joining the colony? No, no, frankly, no. Then one of our projects has failed. Making a believer out of the project boss. Say, boss, you won't be needing me for a while, will you? I guess not, why? Well, I've been kind of curious about that sunken wreck. Thought I might look through it and see what's aboard, okay? Yeah, don't get your feet wet. Aye, aye, sir. # All bound to go where I'll... You know, I've heard of rapture of the deep, but never less than 200 feet. He doesn't seem to be in any pain. Well, there is none with nitrogen narcosis, if that's what it is. # Way hay and up she rises His physical reactions are slightly depressed, but otherwise quite normal. I just can't understand. Let me know the minute there's any change in his condition. I will. (EXHALES) That's funny. I can almost swear that... What? (EXHALES) And out of the blue, a beautiful mermaid. Come here, gorgeous. (MOANING) Do you know what his trouble is? This boy's loaded. Drunk, plain drunk. Well, I'll be a... (EXCLAIMS) # What do you do with a drunken sailor # Early in the morning (LAUGHS) You know, the boys in the Navy said that Chuck could always find a drink any time, any place. But down here, he surpassed himself. Come on, wrangler, it's beddy-bye time in the old sea corral. All right. (HUMMING LOUDLY) (LAUGHS) I like you. What are you doing? I'm checking my medical alcohol. And? It's all there. Every drop. How's your supply of raisin and sugar? You know, I heard that in the service men used to ferment fruit and mash and distill it and... Yes, he tried that a while back, but I stopped him before he could finish. Where did he get it? He couldn't have brought it down with him. Liquor was explicitly forbidden. I'm going to find out where he got it. You know, I liked the way he kissed me. Disgraceful, wasn't it? But, you know, speaking quite frankly, it makes you remember there's something more to living even way down here than cooking a pot of bouillabaisse. You wanted to see me, Doctor? Yes. Amanda brought this for you. Thank you. Mmm-hmm. The defense department is pleased with our reports. Graham is bringing an inspection team out from Washington to look us over. And if they approve us? Well, they'll take over the city officially and I guess I'm out of a job. Congratulations. You sound disappointed. I am. In the city? Why... In you. I'd hoped by this time you'd have been convinced of the importance of what we've done. But if you aren't, a man as able and intelligent as yourself, how can I make the rest of the world believe in it? You want to know why I don't buy this? I think it's a gimmick. You wanted to prove that you could live on the bottom of the ocean. You've don't it and I congratulate you. But, Doctor, it isn't important one way or the other. Not important? The food projects, the minerals, the undersea defense, knowledge of the sea. They're all fine, but do we have to live down here to have them? We could have all those things and still live on dry land. You're right. All of these things would be possible without Amphibia City. But suppose, just suppose there should be a nuclear war. With the earth's entire surface contaminated, radioactive, where would we run to? What would we eat, drink? Where else but the bottom of the sea? The only safe refuge, a haven, an inexhaustible, uncontaminated food supply, a safe atmosphere. No surface danger could touch us. And for how long? Indefinitely. Centuries perhaps. As long as necessary. Then at some distant day, when the surface radioactivity is dissipated and the dry land is safe again, future generations of amphibians would be ready and waiting. Once again life would crawl up out of the sea and repopulate the earth with men and women. Well, here are the menus for the week. That's Bob Gage, isn't it? And Chuck Marlow. Where's Chuck going? I don't know. As a matter of fact, his work is finished. What's he doing out there at all? I wonder if... You want to watch this anymore? No, I've got work to do. (ALARM BEEPING) (GRUNTS) Help! I'm stuck. Monica, don't panic! I'm coming. (GROANING) Look out. Chuck, look out. Behind you. I'm sinking deeper. Hurry! Hold on now. Try to move. Move your foot. I can't get out. Help! Bob! Bob, help me. Bob, she's stuck. Get hold of that rock. When I grab Monica, heave on it. Yeah, got it. You got her, Bob? Okay. I'm all right. The bottom seemed to drop out from under her like quicksand. The same thing happened to me a few days ago, too. What happened? The ground gave way under Monica and a rock pinned her down. It could've been a terrible tragedy. Well, thank heavens nothing seems broken. (SIGHS) I... I told you I was all right. You should know better then to go out there alone. You were mighty lucky. You might have been trapped, drowned. What does that matter to you? One flounder, more or less. Well, with this particular flounder it might make a great deal of difference. Are you all right? Oh, yes, except for a few scratches, I'm fine. The spot where you had the accident, where was it? By the hull of the old wreck. Could I have the geological survey on the Amphibia City site? I'd, uh... I'd like to study it. Certainly, it's in my office. I'll look it up for you. I'll stop by in a little while and pick it up. I don't believe this survey is complete. You see, Carl Wendt was killed before... Yes, yes, I remember. Thank you, Doctor. Is something worrying you? Anything wrong? I don't know. I, uh... I'm not sure. The Manta will arrive in a couple of hours with Mr. Graham and his party from Washington. What do you make of him? I don't know. But whatever Burnett's looking for, he's sure being closed-mouth about it. Well, maybe he's found a sunken treasure and wants to keep it for himself. Well, if that's the case, a geological survey report isn't going to help him much. A last look? Oh, yeah. You'll be going back soon, won't you? With Mr. Graham? Oh, I suppose so. When they approve the city, my job is finished. And I guess you'll be getting on with something more important. Your space platform. I sure hope so. Did I say something wrong? None of this has meant anything to you, has it? I wouldn't say that. Nothing you've done has... Has been important. I wouldn't say that either. I met you. You can't be serious. Mmm. Can't I? Why did you wait so long? I mean, why did you say something now, just as you're leaving and it's too late? Too late? There's nothing that says that you have to stay down here with the fish. Why don't you come back upstairs with me where... Where people belong? MAN ON PA: Attention. Submarine Manta Ray now arriving at hangar port. (SIGHS) The boss. The boss. All right. (SIREN SOUNDING) MAN: Open the storage valves, water hangar. Start air pumps, equalize air pressure for depth. Right this way, gentlemen. Monica. Hello, Tim. Good to see you. Doctor, these gentlemen here are from Washington. This is Bob Gage, Dr. Halstead, Dr. Monica Powers. You are a familiar face, doctor. Don't worry about your bags. Everything will be assigned to your cells. HALSTEAD: When we say cells, we mean your rooms. Thank you, thank you. I couldn't put your book down. It kept me awake for three nights. (LAUGHS) The book had a lot to do with whether... Has the Manta arrived? Oh, they're coming down now. Are you all right, Mr. Burnett? Certainly, yes, certainly. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGING) Here they are. Better warn Phyllis. (CHATTERING) How are you, Mr. Graham? Wally. This is Lieutenant Steele, gentlemen. We'll do the formal introductions and that sort of protocol later. This is truly magnificent, Mr. Graham. It just doesn't seem possible that the world can be as functional down here as it is up where we dwell. You see, Dr Halstead, one cannot describe your dream with words or even with drawings. Say, Tim, if you will, we need you to describe what's going on in the real world up above. You know, we don't get any final editions down here. Here comes the lady with an announcement. I hope you're all as hungry as I am. Welcome. Gentlemen, this is our dietician and hostess, Miss Phyllis Gatewood. Now, Phyllis, I have an idea our visitors from Washington are mighty hungry. Am I right? And we hope the world is still hungry for both knowledge and for undersea food. So, if you'll step this way. I see what makes the sea a great temptation. I shall probably never go back. Just help yourselves, gentlemen, please. Where's Dotty? She was feeling a little tired. She went to lie down. I better look in on her. She's all right. Told me to insist you stay and have your dinner. BURNETT: Excuse me a moment, please. Mr. Graham? Oh, hello, Burnett. I must talk to you alone right away. Well, can't it wait? I'm starved. It's too important, please. Now, just what is it you're trying to say? There isn't the slightest doubt this whole Amphibia City area is undercut, undermined by the current in the trench. Already people have started falling through the crust. You mean, we could go this far, build the whole installation and nobody discovered it? Dr. Wendt was about to, undoubtedly, but he was killed by the moray. Unfortunately, nobody else followed through afterwards before starting construction. The question is what can we do about it now? We must tell them, everybody, right away. The erosive activity is increasing by the minute. At any moment the bottom could collapse, take Amphibia City with it, down into a 1,000-foot trench. Oh, now slow down, take it easy. Now, the sea floor has been there for millions of years, since time began. It isn't going to collapse itself right now in a matter of minutes. It's never had to sustain such weights before. The city, the... The pilings. Perhaps one of our demolition charges jarred loose a key stone or... Well, I'm no geologist, but I know this, no man alive can predict a slide or a volcanic eruption or... Or an earthquake with any accuracy. Don't believe me? Then come with me and see the area for yourself. All right, let's go. I hope you're enjoying the meal. The most amazing food I've ever eaten. And I believe Miss Gatewood has an announcement to make concerning it that may be of interest to you, gentlemen. Phyllis. I just wanted to say that every mouthful you've eaten, from soup to nuts, everything on your plates was gathered, produced, and prepared here on the bottom of the sea. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Delicious. You're sure you know how to operate a lung, Mr. Graham? Well, I can breathe, that's all there is to it, isn't it? Well, yes, but in case of emergency... Let's go. Bite the mouth piece. Hey, Chuck, where's Tim Graham? Out walking on the bottom with Burnett. With Burnett? Yeah, Burnett insisted he wanted to show him something right away. They mentioned the old wreck. I'd better go after them. Graham's had no experience underwater. Don't tell the rest of the people. It's worse than before and getting weaker all the time. The whole bottom structure is undercut. Watch. (GASPS) Graham, Graham, help me. Push the alarm. (ALARM BEEPING) (GRUNTING) I can't hold you. (SCREAMING) I killed him. Burnett tried to tell me, to warn us, and I wouldn't believe him. He tried to tell you what? This whole bottom structure is undercut. There'll be a big slide at any time. We've got to evacuate the city, right now. Now we no longer need fear for mankind's survival. No matter what havoc we may wreak above. Gentlemen, this is the world of the future. (RUMBLING) (SCREAMING) Are you hurt? Phyllis! What happened? What was it? I don't know, the whole place is shaking. Tell the others, Monica. (RUMBLING CONTINUES) MAN: Are you all right, Dr. Halstead? Run for the Manta, quick. Grab lungs, change below. Stay clear of that ledge. My wife, she's alone. Where's Burnett? He's dead. Tim, head for the Manta. I'll go with you. You're a liability down here. Get that rescue sub on its way. HALSTEAD: What's happening? We built on a fault. The whole city's collapsing. Doctor, where are you going? My papers, my records, they're in my quarters. They're priceless. There's no time, Doctor. Where's Phyllis and Monica? In there, changing. Halstead down yet? Not yet. (SCREAMING) Dr. Halstead! Dr. Halstead! (RUMBLING) Dr. Halstead? He's dead. These are his records. Look, a light. One cell didn't go. Which one is it? Wally and Dotty, the honeymoon cell. Wally! Wally! I'm right here, Dotty. We didn't know whether you got out or not. We saw the light. This is the only cell still standing. Are we going to get out of this? The Manta Ray is gone, everything's gone. We saw it out there. How long will these air units last? And the lights? The standby Navy sub, it's coming. (GASPS) Get to the water lock room. Well, I guess we're safe. It's all over now. Yes, it is all over, isn't it? Everything my uncle worked for. You were right, it was just a silly dream. Well, this cell survived even a disaster like this. And the next time we build, it won't be on a geologic fault. Next time? But... But what about outer space? Your platform? I haven't forgotten about it. It will still be there though. Meanwhile, there's inner space. I'm not the kind of guy who quits on a job halfway through. Your uncle thought this data was worth his life. Maybe we can still prove he was right. MALE NARRATOR: Amphibia City is only the beginning. In the future, we will see other undersea colonies, great cities on the sea bottom. In truth the great, rich, bountiful ocean depths, cradle of all life, the world of inner space, may provide a future home and a safe haven for mankind.
