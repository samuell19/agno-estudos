Hana Yori Dango - Final Re-timing by Nay @ SilentRegrets re-timed again by surplusletterbox for [Seraimes Rip] Wow, it's really wide! As far as the eye can see there are rocks. What will be happening? But if you think about it it is the first time the two of us are traveling together. What are you thinking? Eh? It doesn't matter how you think about it but you can't call this a trip Don't get too excited about it. I'm not getting too excited. But... why didn't we go by plane? If there would be news about us coming here He might have escaped. Hey, hey. If.. just if we came back to Japan without anything in our hands the marriage would get canceled, ne. If it gets canceled I'll kill that witch. Let's hurry. OK. I just hope we can find him fast. This bastard. Hey, you took the picture with you, didn't you? Ha,ha,ha,ha,HA What is it? In front, in front! AAAAAAAAAAAAah! Unbelievable! 2 weeks before in Tokyo Today we have something to say to all of you that came here For a long time now there are reports about the private of Doumyouji Tsukasa, the young representative of Doumyouji-holdings, in magazines and newspapers but now we have reached the point where the real person will give an official statement on it. I, Doumyouji Tsukasa, decided to get married next year in spring. She is a common person and has no "bird figure? , but she is... at that time... I'm sorry, it should be "virtures" He went abroad and now his Japanese has become weak. Hey, You over there!!! Are you an asshole? You can't be strong or weak in Japanese because it is just a language. However, this is the woman I took in my heart, my destiny: It is Makino Tsukushi OMG... She will graduate from Eitoku university in spring and I decided to get married to her afterwards. Hey, this sister looks funny. For sure. She has a weird face. UNBELIEVABLE!!! Why did it had to be that picture? Cause you look just normal in this picture. But it would have been better to take a picture that's a bit nicer, doesn't it?! Everyone here will laugh about me. The whole world will laugh about me! I'm sure this will do. If you show them Makino's best shot. people all over the world will fall for of her. You don't want that, don't you? Eh? So Hanazawa Rui told you to take this? Not just him. Take something that has some special impact so it will be easier for everyone around the world to remember her. Just take a normal picture of her, a Makino-like one. There is no need for me to be remembered. It is an important thing to make everyone remember your face! From now on you will show up as my wife at a lot of different places. If thats the case, you should have presented me as a beauty, as a your lovely wife Everyone on this world thinks about oriental beauty and takes the Japanese just as fine so don't show that side. And the result is this?! Where is this an oriental beauty? What is this? Don't do that! Don't be so worried about it without any reason. What's important is what is inside. Now I will tell you what I want to say about this general situation. Although you are one of F4, ... Ah, are you thinking one of the others is wrong? No, I'm not. You are lying. You are a strange woman. I'm not strange. I just wanna be seen as a lovely woman. You understand too less of such things. Ha? What are you talking about? I'm a man. As a man, why do I have to be able to understand a womans heart? Ha ~ you know... Do you want me to become a man who is as emotional as a woman? ma~ I think just a bit wouldn't be that bad. Ha? That's how you are, ne. That's why you liked Rui in the past. In any case, take this picture out... Hey, listen to me. When it comes to Rui, listen to me with all your mind! Why? Makino, you... Could it be that still somewhere in your heart... That's not right. I'm not feeling anything for him, but... But??? What does BUT mean? I want you to stop deciding everything without even asking me about it. Like making this sudden announcement. Because of this press conference my family got really in trouble. Hello to everyone! I am now above the house of Doumyouji-Hall's successor Doumyouji Tsukasa's fianc? Makino Tsukushi Please look over here. Like Doumyouji told at the conference, she seems to be a daughter of a quite simple family. The whole world pays attention to her now, Congratulations... I think I should take a day off. It seems that marrying Doumyouji means that we don't have privacy any more. It is awful! Watch the TV! The TV! Let's learn something about the history of the fianc? Makino Tsukushi. Makino Tsukushi was born in 1988, 28th December as the daughter of the father Harupo and the mother Keiko. Oh no! Where did they get that picture from? You look like an idol. To say it more clear, they will laugh about you. It seems that she has been a girl who was as strong as a boy. Unbelievable. Where did they get that from? Let us listen to some talk of people that are near to Tsukushi. Tsukushi is a childhood friend of mine she was a really masculine girl so till junior high she could not imagine to date a boy. This is... To tell the truth, Tsukushi-chan was in love with Doumyouji's friend Hanazawa xxx! So Yuki is the source for their information? He was her first love. But at that time Doumyouji-kun already fell madly for her and then Mamasaki-san fell for me... It's Okami-san Father(-in-law), mother(-in-law) please fell free to relax a bit more. Susumu, please don't hesitate and eat as much as you want. I'm doing it. From now on I would like you to present yourself in public not Tsukasa's shade but as his wife. I really want you to be remembered as one of the Doumyouji-family. Excuse me.... What is it, mother? Will Tsukushi really fit in the situation? Don't worry. She is the women I adore. I'm sorry to interrupt. It has been a while, sempai! That hurts. Congratulation for these happenings. This is for the people who get concerned with the Doumyouji-family, it is a tiara that has a long history in this family, the proof of an engagement. It is the talisman of the Doumyouji-family. I will give that to you. Thank you very much. These are called America's hope Hongkong's tear The love flowing in the southern sea A secret of the old times. The four legendary jewels. There is a legend that says the love of the person who has this tiara will last for eternity. Although this tiara has a heroic history it is called "the smile of Venus? according to it's beauty. Eternal love? That's wonderful, isn't it? I can't eat now. You're right. But if there's no love the food wouldn't taste good. Your words are deep, Papa. Although it is like that, this room... ...is large! Yes! Tsukushi, Aren't you scared? Is everything OK? Why should I be? I'm talking about getting married. Hm, there are things I'm uneasy about, but... You don't need to be reserved and to overdo it. OK. If it becomes to hard you can say "Stop this? anytime. Sister! Tsukushi, Doumyouji-san is here. Ah, thank you very much for offering the meal and even preparing such a beautiful room today. It's my first time that I'm in such a hotel. I think I won't be able to sleep tonight. I'm going to have dinner now and if it is OK for you, let's eat all together. If you talk about this... Tsukushi, Tsukushi. Just the two of you, without being watched... I heard you are busy with work and have hardly time to relax. We can eat at the restaurant because your mother arranged it for us. But then let's eat all toge... ARE YOU SURE? Thank you very much! Hey... What is it, Makino? Do you feel uneasy about the two of us being alone? That's not how it is, but.. That's not how it is, but what? There is a lot of pressure. Makino, you are that type of a person... aquamarine (blue) You mean marriage-blue Getting married isn't a color. You are really a fool. Why is he fluent in English but still weak in such kind of stuff?! Hey, Makino. Hm? I can see your pants. I understand you have a lot of pressure. but I will protect you your whole life. Don't be worried, follow me. Ah! The thing he took away was... The "Smile of Venus? Hey, wait... Oi, wait you bastard. Wait! Hey, ... You bastard. Wait for me! Shut up! Now you will get what you deserve! Wait! This bastard... Who are you, bastard? This is really precious for us so please give it back! Hey, don't jump in front of our eyes. How mad are you? That isn't true, is it? Hm, Why? Why is everything in order? What is going on? There is no mistake A person came in here... There is no mistake it has been this room. That's not true. Or, what is going on? The two of you, please calm down. You are sure that wasn't a dream? It was no dream! You see, it's missing. It really isn't there! What is missing? Doumyouji's mother's pre... It is nothing. Nothing is wrong. I'm sorry but I didn't notice anything. But just a short while ago something horrible happened in this hotel. A man covered in black and Doumyouji had a fight and the hotel got messed up. I have no report of things like that at all and none of the guests said something about it. Hey, it even hasn't been 30 minutes. Hey... If Doumyouji-sama got unpleasant thoughts here, I'm deeply sorry for that. Nothing? There is no way that not even the manager knows about it. It is something that should be on the news. Don't look at me, you're ugly! I'm really sorry. So you mean the employees from the hotel have stolen it? No, I don't think it's that easy. France It's today, your wedding. Isn't it? Rui Why didn't you call me? Because we decided to do it just with the two of us. You see, I already cut the relationship to my family What about Makino? Did you contact her? Now isn't the moment for that. Because Tsukushi-chan will also (get married). You are right. In Tsukasa's case it will be magnificent, the wedding party, won't it? Because he is becoming more important for the group by doing so. Ne, somehow you don't seem to be so cheerful. That's because the people I adore are getting married. What are you planing to do in the future? What do you mean? Will you take over the work of your family or will you follow your own way? It is a fact that I'm not the kind of person who stands at the top of a big business. Slowly I also have to graduate from various things. I'm sorry, I have to go now. Ok Congratulations, Shizuka. Become happy. Thank you. I wanted to congratulate her from eye to eye... Ah. Yo! Tsukasa. What happened to your face? Rui, if... if something should happen by any chance... just if something will happen to me Ha, what are you talking about? From then on I will leave everything to you. Everything? Yes, everything. Wait, what? What's going on, did something happen? I don't want to say it. Why? Because I don't want to trouble you. What about Makino? This is a problem between her and me. There even is the possibility that the marriage will be impossible. You're lying, aren't you? Of course I plan to marry her whatever will happens. .. Did you talk to Soujiro and Akira? Not yet. The two of them are quite busy. He seems to be busy not just with tea ceremony but also with management and with lectures. He also stretches the culture of tea ceremony outside Japan. Yeah Akira also took over the work of his parents and is traveling around the world. It looks like he risks his life every day. It isn't that I won't consult them but I can't. You might be right. So the only person that has a lot of time and that you can ask a favor... ...is you. But, although it is you who asks a favor I can't just put my effort in it without knowing the reasons. That's because it is just in case. In case something will happen. Hey, Nishida. Did you get to know something? The owner of the hotel "Boruberu? is called Kaburagi. Has he any business going on with us? There is no business but he has magnificent management abilities and lately he seems to be the topic of conversations quite often. So you think it could be him? Why did it have to come to this? We really are in trouble. By the way, presently he seems to be in Las Vegas Makino! Let's go for a trip. He? A trip? Isn't it obvious, to America! To Las Vegas. Let's go, together. You are right. That's how it is. We have to get it back. I just hope we can find him a bit faster. This bastard. Hey, you took the picture with you, didn't you? Ha,ha,ha,HA What is it? In front, in front! AAAAAAAAAAAAah! Unbelievable! I was really surprised. What were you doing? Please look to the front when you drive. You bastard, come out. Just because you drive a big car nobody gives you the right to... No, no! Stop it. We were the one that were mistaken. OMG. Hey, are you crazy? What the fuck are you doing? Shut up, Jerk. Hey, I recognize you... Doumyouji. What? Yeah. I remember you No, no, no, no, no. From Doumyouji and enterprises, I've seen your TV interview, yeah, I remember you. By the way, is there anyplace to eat around here? A restaurant? There is a caf? about 2 miles down the road. Foods pretty good. Ok, that's fine. Thank you, thank you. It was nice to meet you. Huh, what is going on? See you guy. Hold on one second, hold on one second. Doumyouji. I asked for a place to eat. He? Let me get your autograph. Hmmmmm ~ It's really delicious! If it's something to eat for you, anything fine, Makino. If you don't want yours I can eat it for you. Yours isn't enough? That hamburger should be enough. But it's so tasty. There is a lot of flavor in it. If you really think so then eat this. Thank you! You're that kind of person... After getting married you will gain weight constantly and will need even more than now. That might be true. If I have too much free time to eat I might become really fat. What will you do then? What will I do? Ma ~ It doesn't matter how much you are a swollen fatty, Makino stays Makino. Hm? For me it doesn't matter whether you are a fatty or an ugly women. Because I'm in love with your existence. If I wouldn't be I couldn't consider to marry an ugly women like you. Ugly? So you really think I am ugly... There is no way I could think that. There is no mistake that you are the only one in my heart, you are the world greatest woman. What makes me the world greatest woman? Anything, your face. We're definitely getting back the tiara. OK. Eat up. OK. It's delicious! It's that delicious? Yeah This rock looks like you. There is no way I could be a rock! It isn't similar to me at all. It is! Try it one more time. Aren't you tired? He's angry again. 60km till Las Vegas Las Vegas Wow, awesome. Come down here. That hurts. At this dirty place? But it will be cheap. Look, it just 39 dollars. Thats unbelievable. Let's return to some place I request. But Nishida-san told us so. Young master. I'm sorry to interfere, but try to move as inconspicuous as possible. He? If your mother gets to know about this it would be bad. So you mean we should do it as a commoners trip? Please leave it to me. This should be everything? It's unbelievable. For me it's even too big, it's very admirable. Whats even more important, first we have to go to the place where the owner of that hotel stays and have to get him fast. He? We came till here and if he goes back to Japan now it would be bad. Wow... he is staying at an awesome place. It's just normal. Our values are really too different. But the question is how we can find this guy here. Ha, ha, ha~ What's up with you? Shigeru. Shigeru! That must be a lie ~ Tsukushi!!! Have you been well? Yeah You haven't changed at all. Tsukushi somehow became a woman. Hey, monkey. Woh, Tsukasa. Could it be that the two of you are on a premarital trip? What's more important, did you come here to enjoy yourself? I will meet a good looking person here. Hee? Could it be that he is your lover? No, no, no. It's a man that has business going on with my father. ah. You seem so happy, Shigeru. Not as much as you are, Tsukushi. What kind of person is he? Is he American? No, he is Japanese. Now he has some days off and came here to enjoy himself. he... You see, in Tokyo we have a hotel called "Boruberu?. He is Kaburagi-san, the owner of that hotel. eh? Are you serious? That must be a lie. Is it... somehow bad? Kaburagi-san! Shigeru-chan, you are late. I'm sorry. I met some friends by accident. He? I give up. You really came till here. I'll just say that it wasn't me who stole the tiara. Then who did ask you to do it? It is obvious that you were involved. I don't know. Hey, you liar. Wait, wait. Oi! Calm down. If you get rowdy they will throw you out. They should just try to throw me out, I'm not that soft. Small boys have temperament I'm not a small boy! Don't talk to me from above, you damn thief. You know, just because you are Shigeru's friends don't think that I will treat you nice whatever happens. It's the same here. Don't get the wrong idea that we will treat you nice just because you are Shigeru's friend. But you actually have a relation to the tiara being stolen. On that day, suddenly, there came a letter without a sender on it. It said that at the 20th of January, in hotels related to my group we should act like nothing has happened whatever occurred. It was that day. Because we did so I got 5 million. Therefore I did it. But to be honest, I didn't know who this person was and where he was from. Hey, 5 million dollar are...? About 600 million Yen. OMG I felt bad about getting such a big amount of money from someone I haven't seen or known. But I thought he was a quite dangerous person so I said nothing. That's all. Normally people wouldn't accept such things. This guy has nothing in his head, hasn't he? Even if you are the top of Doumyouji enterprise you should choose your words. Don't speak so proud of you with all of your strength. Kaburagi-san. Because you accepted the conditions of someone you don't even know we lost the tiara that was really important for us. That is just business. This is business. So that means as long as you get your money you won't even care if someone gets murdered? Is that how it is? Doumyouji! Don't play with me, you bastard! Guest! This is America. If you get rowdy... You aren't a child any more so don't get so rowdy all of a sudden. He pissed me off, that bastard! But I wonder if the story he told us is true. It didn't look like he lied to us but it was also not a story I would just totally believe. Then, who gave that person that big amount of money? It was not a normal minded rich lord. That really makes no sense. Maybe he was from the Mafia or something like that. Makino Hm? Are you scared? I'm not scared, but... Are you sure about it? Kind of. I mean I'm together with Doumyouji. That's how it is?! From now on there will be such difficult situations all the time. That might be so. I wonder if you can still follow me. Even if it continues our whole life. Who knows... What do you mean with this "who knows"? You see Even as poor people we live an ordinary life There hasn't been situations like this where you risk your life. To see it realistic, even now it is odd that we are still alive. You don't need to worry. because I'm the immortal Doumyouji. Even if you are immortal I'm still a normal person. But, you see, you are that kind of thing... "A dead leaf?! I'm not a dead leaf, but weed! That's what I meant. Cause of that you will be ok. But you see. Surely weed won't work this time. Hm? Why? The people that want to become part of the Doumyouji family will have to become more, more and even more strong. Somehow.. What? It is just somehow but I feel like understanding why Doumyouji's mother is a "women of iron?. He? If she was 't that way, I don't think she would have made it so far. Oh... Yo, Tsukasa! How are you? It's about the "Smile of Venus?. It is the crown Makino got from Tsukasa's mum, isn't it? The Tiara, ne. What is with it? Soon there will be held a secret auction in Hong Kong. A secret auction? The fact that this object is sold by this auction causes a great interest in my business groups. Are you serious with that? I wonder if the thing at the auction could be a fake. It's the real one, maybe. He? Who is the exhibitor? Because it is an auction where just people with bad relations bring their stolen goods I don't know who the exhibitor is. Everywhere is the rumor that a successful bid would be about 30 billion. 30 billion?! This is unbelievable. We have to make a successful bid. But the amount 30 billion, do you have so much? If I use the money of the company for free it wouldn't be impossible. Are you serious? But under the conditions now I can't do it. You are right. Your mother would find out about everything. Hey. Hm? Should we sleep together? What are you talking about, so suddenly. after talking about this now it is not the time for this. We are getting married, the two of us. And what? That's why... Omg... Kaburagi-san. What kind of person are you? You didn't even knock! This is the 5 million dollars I got. He? You need money to get the stolen thing back, don't you? he! ...but... But what? So suddenly we can't accept such a big amount of money from someone we rarely know. If you follow this meaningless opinion you will become poor. I am already poor. If you don't need it in any case return it to me tomorrow. He? There are two ways. You can just return it to me like it is now. The second is... to return it after making profit at the casino? Because Las Vegas is a city of games. There are really 5 million dollar inside. I feel bad about it... Not caring about people being killed just because I got money, how shall I say it. I don't want the grudge of others because of that money. You are going to marry the top of Doumyouji group, ne. It seems so... How old are you? I'm 22. Weren't you worried? Getting married so young. Of course I was worried or, how should I say it... I'm still not sure if it is really ok like this Then it's better if you cancel it. eh? From now on you have the chance to meet a much better men. Hey what were you talking about? It was nothing. Let's use this money. Then we can get the tiara back at the auction. Ok. Hey, what's the matter? just... OI! Don't tell me you are attached to that men! He? That's wrong. Because you are really unfaithful, I can't stop thinking about just now. I'm the one that can't stop thinking about just now. To get excited right away. You aren't Kaburagi-san but if I compare you with him you are really a kid. Oi Oi,oi,oi,oi,oi! After all your heart is attached to him! I said you were wrong! Listen, He has a relation to the people that want to stop our wedding! Don't get it the wrong way, you unfaithful girl! Hey! Can't you stop calling me unfaithful?! Hey, Makino, Makino! Hey Makino! hm? Are you still mad? Why are you mad while you are unfaithful? I already said I'm not unfaithful! That was clearly unfaithfulness. We just talked a bit, entirely... Anyway, it doesn't matter what we have to do but we will get the tiara back. ok. Ah, welcome to my casino. Sir, you're welcome. I've got 5 million in cash. Change dollars. Yes sir, I'll take care of it right way. Would you care for a cocktail? No need. What are the rules? Listen. First they put a ball in the rotation board. When you get the right number you will get 36 times the amount of your bet. When you get it right in this cases it will be 3 times. For red or black, odd or even, high or low you get 2 times of it. 50.000 dollar-chips, 5 million in total. Yosh! Let's begin! At the beginning... What are you doing? I thought it would be a vast... Wait a second. If we loose it the game will be over. If do it it with small amounts we won't get 3 billion. We'll battle with "00?! There is a way of winning, a way of winning! In this situation we have to try it in one battle! But you know what happens if "00? doesn't come. Let's just use half of it. And start from black or red or something like that. No, no more bets. he? You can't change your bets now. I really can't understand the sense of being rich. Because you are like this you are poor. It will be decided by this. When we miss we won't be able to marry, right? It will be ok! In the first place, the probability of us getting married is about the same as a miracle. What should that mean? ha... Stay here! You bastard! Wait for me! Hey wait! It went here in the first place and then changed to this. Hey, that's odd. It moved there just because the table moved. Stay here! It's odd! I can't let it go like this. It doesn't matter how I think about it, this won't go! DAMN IT! Hey, Why, why? Leave it, why? Hey, wait, stop this! Let me go, let me go! I didn't do anything wrong! Wah! I'm really sorry. Ah, that hurts. Are you alright? Hey, wait, wait! What are you doing? That hurts! That was a catastrophe. I really acted like myself. That's the end. Really nothing goes well. Ma~kino That can't be true. You are not a chief at all, Makino. You don't look like someone related to the Doumyouji company. But that is just Makino herself, that's her great side. Why is everyone... Because you are troubled we all came to help you. That's what F4 stands for. How was it? The roulette. We already won but then they threw me out. Don't take it so hard. It's our meeting after long and then... Let's celebrate your wedding Once again! Let's do a toast. Kanpai! But whatever you said, you wanted to be together with me. That's not how it is. The one we are concerned about is Makino. He? On the phone last time I had the feeling that you were in a bad situation. And then you came here? That's how it is. We thought it could be hard for Makino when you have to follow Tsukasa all the time. Everyone... thank you. I was rescued by you all the time. Really... thank you very much. OI, Makino. It looks like it is really hard to be together with me. It is hard! Isn't it obvious that it's hard? Is it that 'spicy' to be together with me? You mean 'hard', don't you. He? He is really too stupid, I don't want that any more. Hey, don't cry Makino. I'm fine. I'm crying because I'm happy. What? Hey, Makino, your nice plain face becomes even more plain. Oi, Soujiro! Where is she plain? Be careful not to say the wrong things. Don't you mean 'be careful with the words you say'? You should be the one to be careful about what to say! I don't get it. Hey, don't cry. Don't cry. Hey, wait, wait! Don't touch her so familiar, Baka. Why, isn't it ok? It's not! Baka. Why? Because your illness of doing nothing will affect her. You don't change at all, Tsukasa. Watching us, you also want to get married, na? Not at all. Why? By the way, without joking, your marriage might be endangered?! Not at all. But... If we can't return the tiara...that will be the end. Under this conditions, shall we attend the auction?! That's what we planned to do, but... Shall I introduce Hong Kong to you? I guess we have no choice. Shall we go? Welcome to the F4-Jet. This is a wedding present from the three of us. Are you serious? This airplane? That's right. You don't feel like your in an airplane, do you? This is really a world I can't understand. Guys... Thank you! About the money we will do something. He? When we make a successful bid the money will come to the thief, right? Therefore in the end we will do something to get that guy. And bring it to an end. In the end, Mimasaka-san has the smell of a back street. In the first way the thing we have to do now is to return the tiara to make the wedding possible. Yeah. The problem is how to make out the thief in a secret auction. Follow me. Ha, why? Just wait. Ok, this is a plan of the auction hall. It is really detailed. They are doing all the bidding with a computer. Because it's like a net-auction our target might not come. No,Because it would be bad when the identity would be discovered by a net address or the recipient, it is all based on handling in cash. They even handle 1 billion in cash? That's how it is. That's unbelievable. But that means that the person who settles the finances will meet him. Hm, that's because everyone that steps inside here has a relation to some crime. What do you mean, that's scary. But why do this guys wants to stop your wedding? Maybe they have a problem with Doumyouji as a person. That could be it. Don't play with me! We are going to live together from now on, is this is the first barrier for that? In practice there is no other reason. Ma~ ma~, calm down, the two of you. That's right. In any case, our target is in Hong Kong and it's certain that we will attend the auction. I'll definitely kill him. Let's teach them to fear F4 when they get serious. ok. It hurts. Hong Kong Then, shall we go? What? Someone you know? That's the guy that helped the thief to steal the tiara. Then isn't he somehow also a criminal?! That means... This bastard. But... But what? I have the feeling that Kaburagi-san isn't a criminal Ha? Cool down. Even if that should be the case, we know him and so we can make him out afterwards. It looks like something unexpected happened. Unexpected? A friend of them is interfering. There is no need to worry. Isn't the way they know this friend a bit strange...? 200 million, 200 Million, 200 Million 210 million, 210 million It is an amazing grand and expensive auction And now, the time to show the "Smile of Venus? came. The preparations for this are easy. Hm... I wonder how expensive it will become. It appeared. Hey, it suddenly started with 1 billion. Now, whatever happens, we will make a successful bid! It went up suddenly. It looks like someone is here who raises the price constantly. Shall we just check the state for now? ok That means this is becoming the finest article here It could be that an exhibitor has a lot of self confidence and rises it constantly. By that... That means it is getting harder for us to get it. They want us to pay a lot. Maybe, at that way, %$/&$(/)/()/&(% That's a lie... Although it is in front of my eyes Let's go! Although he plays with us the only thing we can do is go! But the other pay the money. Is it ok for you to be unable to get married? That's not what we are talking about right now. Ha? Calm down! Tsukasa, we decided to help in this case. So let's make a successful bid. Because we have to pay cash our target will be the guy that goes out here with some million in cash It should be ok when we get our money back then. I wonder if it will work out. So you just want to sit here and do nothing? Oi, it is raising constantly. Is there someone else who wants it that much? Hello, can you bring 1 billion in cash here immediately. One minute left. Go! Go! We'll definitely win that auction! ok, stop here. Yes. We made it just barely. 4,200,000,000 Hong Kong Dollar In Japanese Yen it is 6 Billion. That must be a lie. Yosh. In the first way we got it back. Thank you everyone. Now we can get married. I wonder if it's ok like this. To get married... Oi! Kaburagi-san So you made a successful bid on the tiara? Yes. We did it. To get a successful bid for that amount of money, that's what is to expected of Doumyouji group. What happend? What is with that sad expression. Did you have a fight with that rich son? No, we didn't have a fight, but... You are a bit troubled about the wedding? Ok, if you are really worried about something you can consult me anytime as someone with a lot of life experience. Call me anytime! See you He is really an adult. What is going on? What's that? He? Damn it... Wait. What is it? Just now I saw something strange. There was that thief who stole the tiara, the one in black. This guy was here? Wait a moment. He? What is it? I don't think I'm mistaken but But what? He talked with Hanazawa Rui. He? It was a bit far away so I didn't get what they were talking about. What does that mean? Who knows... But... at the end they even shook hands. Are you sure that you are not mistaken? No, I think I'm probably not mistaken. Probably? Don't talk like that about such stuff! But... Are you in doubt about Rui? I wouldn't call it being in doubt... You definitely saw it wrong. But... Isn't it obvious you are mistaken?! Hanazawa Rui. Oh.. what happened? A bit earlier, you talked with someone, didn't you? Who was that? What are you talking about? Hanazawa Rui, you didn't talk with anyone? I didn't talk to anyone. You didn't shake hands with someone? Shake hands? Makino, didn't you mistake me for someone else? Furthermore, The criminal that stole the tiara... He escaped? Sorry. That means he got away with the money. Ma~ First of all we got the tiara back. But it still hurts not to know who that criminal is. Isn't there any way to search for the criminal who took the money with him? It is impossible, ne. Ne, Hanazawa Rui, I'm asking you one more time... Hey! But... There is no 'But' It's ok so just come with me! Hey, wait! Wait, it hurts. Release me! Calm down now! What are you thinking of? But it looks like there is definitely something going on! The money we used was theirs. We didn't do anything to get the tiara back. It was their confidence that did it! But something is definitely strange! Being cool although they lost that amount of money is unbelievable! For us it's just some money... It's 6 BILLION Yen! Whatever you say that much money isn't something to forget that easily! Then, what is their purpose? Why should they cheat us? I don't know but for example Nishikado-san... He doesn't seem sad at all that we didn't get it back. Mimasaka-san also talks like it wouldn't matter at all. Not just Hanazawa Rui, I think all 3 of them are hiding something You... In any case, it is strange! It's definitely strange! Saying ?It is strange, it is strang?, the strange one is YOU! He? How can you talk so bad about them? It wasn't my intention to talk bad about them! Then, what intention did you have? That's why... Just listen We already had a lot of things to be grateful to them but there wasn't one time they made us doubt them! I'm saying it that far, but was the men you saw really that black man? Did he and Rui really shake hands? Hey, wait a moment! That means you don't believe me? Doubting them that far, there will be no excuse if you are really mistaken. I will definitely give the money back to you! I'm really sorry to trouble all of you this time. Ma, ma. If you can get happy by that it's a cheap thing. What about Makino? Did you have a fight? I don't know. What is the cause? It's nothing. What is it, what is it? Although we got the tiara back you had a fight? If you aren't confident, Makino will get departed from you. That's how it is. Don't see it like everything is already done. Makino also gets tired of the hard times with you. Tsukasa, if you don't answer her feelings right... SHUT UP! Cool down! You have already said that much! What is it? Now you take your anger out on us? Makino is.. It's about YOU... He? What? What? What is it about us? It is nothing. I don't get it. Anyway, what I want to say is that friendship between boys is important. If it's important then don't let out your anger at us! Does that mean you instruct me? Tsukasa, the things you say are all mixed up! Where are the things I say mixed up?! Release me! Try to say that one more time! Oi! &%$&(%/(%$/&()&/$ Clearly, no one except for Makino can handle you. Hurry up to learn the use of Japanese! Don't talk to me like im an animal! Tsukasa What happened? We finally got the tiara back. Na Rui... Hm? What is it? It is ok for me to believe you, isn't it? Eh? Because I believe you. In the case something happens He? If the time comes that something happens you said you would entrust me everything. Yes.. Now I'm thinking about a lot of things about the meaning of entrusting me everything. In any case, I believe in you. What is this? It's delicious! You like places like this better, don't you? You really are an adult. Have you confidence to stay with him together for a whole life? right now... I don't know But getting divorced is not a difficult or rare thing any more. By any chance, Kaburagi-san... At my first time. So that's how it is. In my case it happened because we suddenly wanted to experience being married. The cause why you broke up with your wife, was it by any chance that you were capricious? That wasn't the cause. When I think of it now we were a really dearly married couple. Then why? At one time I asked her the question: What is your dream right now? Dream? She was a designer and as a designer she wanted to become famous all around the world wanted to form a new branch wanted to show her collection everywhere. It was like flying from one dream to the next. Isn't that nice? At that time I also thought so. But I realized later that there was no place for me. Then I asked myself what my dream was At that time in my head there were just dreams of my work and there was no place for her. I thought somehow that she wasn't the thing that was really important for me. And the way round, for her it wasn't me. But when someone is troubled about the wedding like you now, Tsukushi-chan, Thank you for the food. No, you were welcome. But why have you been at the auction hall? To tell the truth, I was asked by Shigeru-chan. By Shigeru? "Do whatever you can to get that Tiara back", that is what she said to me. That's how it was. But I'm happy that you got the tiara back without me doing something about it. Yes. See you. Don't make Shigeru cry, ne! A Dream...? Oh Good morning. Hey What? Where did you go after that last night? Where did you go? It doesn't matter where I went. It does! We are going to get married! Oi! Are we really going to get married? The two of us... Are you really troubled about it? This is your champagne. We finally got the tiara back. Getting married to me ~ will it really make you happy, Doumyouji? I haven't thought about such stupid things. It's ok just to look forward. Doumyouji's dream... He? What is your dream, Doumyouji? My dream is... What is this? Where are we? Is it a dream? Doumyouji, Hey! Doumyouji! Where are we? To speak of it, maybe... It looks like a deserted island. Doumyouji... The tiara is gone. That must be a lie. I wonder how long they can take it. It looks somehow like we were abandoned. So it's a step backwards again. It's unbelievable. Ne, I don't think anyone will come to rescue us. Why should that be so? You see, this looks like we got exposed. The only thing we can do is to live with our own strength. AHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhh! What is it? Speaking of this, do you remember the story about the 'Smile of Venus' we listened to in that room? America's hope Hong Kong's tear The love flowing in the southern sea A secret of the old times. The four legendary jewels. It is the same route we came here. I wonder if we are really here by accident. Or was it decided from the beginning that we would come here?! But if that is true we have one more place to go. Maybe it will be to heaven or to hell. It's finally done! Anyway, if we don't stay alive here... First of all, let's put out all food we have in our baggage. And there is water and )(&&/$%&?$ Damn it! Hey! Is there anyone? That hurts... I want to go home. Hey, what happened? Are you alright, Makino? I'm alright. Don't overdo yourself. If we don't overdo ourselves we can't stay alive! What are we doing here? Maybe it was really a mistake to think about marrying Doumyouji. Why is it like that? But that's how it is. If that tiara had not been there from the beginning something like this would not have happend. Are you serious about that? Being together with you all the time I kind of understood. What is it? It seems like in the end our values are really different. ha...? Being together from now on... I wonder if it can really go well. It is a matter whether we have the will to let it go well or not. I want to go through life together with you. and there is no doubt about it. I got one. Damn it! A bear? Don't joke with me! Why do I have to face it like this? I just simply wanted to become happy. Why? Why do I get attacked by everyone? To die here is UNBELIEVABLE! I hit him... Don't be so full of it! I won't run away. I declare war! He? What is she doing? Where did it go? Doumyouji! Doumyouji! Thanks for this. You are in love with me?! I AM in love with you! You are stupid, selfish and self-centered. I am in love with you. Makino! Makino! Hey, Makino! What are you doing? I'm sorry, I... let's stand up. I'm sorry I... lost it. He? The necklace of Saturn Although it was a very very important necklace for us. Makino The most important thing for me is you. Don't let me worry because of trivial things. Oh, I found our meal. If you eat this you will become a bit more cheerful. Thank you. I've even more... Where was it? A bird took it to his nest. That was where I found the eggs. So a bird took it with him. That's how it seems. That is great. Maybe you lately forgot about it the things you did together with me. He? What? That we are chosen by destiny What do you want? That's dangerous. Wait for me! That hurts... What are you doing? Ne... huh? I wonder how much time went past since we came here. Maybe about 1 month? Hasn't it been even longer? I don't know any more how much time went past. I think in Japan it will be spring soon... Talking of that, Makino, your graduation ceremony. Ha, I totally forgot about it. However I see it, I haven't taken the test so graduating will be impossible. Damn it. I thought about getting married on the day of your graduation. Damn it. Ne Ha? I just thought of it while being here hard or sad things will become half if you force it with two persons. Funny and happy things become twice they were if you do them together. That may be true. A life on this island might not be that bad after all. Here I can be together with Makino all the time without being disturbed by anyone. Speaking of this, Doumyouji's dream... hm? What is your dream? It is already fulfilled. He? I love you. I won't let you go whatever will happen. Makino, what is your dream? My dream? My dream is... Oi, look there! he? It's coming over here. Rescue us! Help me! Help me! We made it Doumyouji! We are safe, we are safe! Wait a moment! Isn't that strange? he? What? Have you been well? I'm here to take you from here. What is your intention? The last stage is prepared. The last stage? It's about the time... Kyoto The two of you, please come here. Sorry to make you wait. So you are the black curtain? How was life when you had to survive at a deserted island? You must be hungry. Enjoy yourself and eat a lot. What is your intention? Las Vegas Hong Kong The island in the southern sea. I wonder what you saw there. Who are you? ha... So you finally see it with your eyes. Wait, what are you doing, Doumyouji? We don't need this thing any more. That means we won't play in your games any more! So you realized it. That it was all an imitation. Ha? Imitation... ...that means it was a fake? The "Smile of venus? didn't exist on earth from the beginning. It didn't exist means... that it was all made up? That's how it is. There aren't any people in this world that don't bless your wedding. I am also one of them. Don't talk senseless crap, old men! Doumyouji. We thought we would die! You are still young. There are people that are uneasy about your marriage. What does that mean? Tsukushi-san. They wonder whether you really can be happy with Doumyouji. and if you were really chosen by destiny. Therefore you did this foolish things? Foolish things? What would you have done if we broke up doing this? Then we would just have known that you were not chosen by destiny. But why did you test us? I was just asked to do so. To speak of it who are you? He is an old friend of mine. So it was all the witch's doing? That's not how it is. Kaede-san was also asked to do it. Then who asked her to do so? Tsukushi-san, it was your papa and mama. he? Your parents really wanted you to become happy. Getting married with someone who is rich and whose life is so different compared to yours... They wondered if you could be happy with him for your whole life. Therefore they consulted Kaede-san with their doubt. It's delicious. There could be even harder and more sad things than getting divorced waiting for you. At a young age you can run forward just with passion but the life is long. Tsukushi! Mama, Papa Have you been uninjured? yeah Have you been ok? Stay with Doumyouji forever from now on. I wanted to make sure myself whether you can become happy with him. I'm sorry, Tsukushi. To give you so much trouble. I'm really sorry Doumyouji-san. Don't bow down in front of me! Makino is the daughter of such a nice mother and father. Because of the things that happened my will of living together with Tsukushi-san my whole life got stronger. Doumyouji... I will definitely make Tsukushi-san happy. Putting together our strength we will walk through life together. For giving birth to Makino and raising Makino up, I'm thankful from the bottom of my heart Thank you very much. Thank you very much! I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble. Just you I want to hit one time. Then I will forgive everything. He? Wait! It was for your sake that we had a lot of fun. If it would be in the past he wouldn't have stopped his arm. It was really delicious (to watch). The soup (->event) you gave me just now. Please don't compare it with the time we were 20. I'm sorry I asked you for such an impossible thing. Don't say such offish things. Really, thank you very much. They will definitely become happy. If they became happy it would be good... He really became a sightly man. Although it's a good feeling to know everything now, it's still a bit regrettable. eternal love is something that exists just when you believe in it. To believe in it is really important. Eternal love is nothing you can see with your eye The imitation of the tiara had that meaning. While experiencing this trip, to make us realize eternal love You mean there was the "Smile of Venus" Ha.... The goddess is smiling. He? Welcome back. I'm home. Mother in law Welcome back. It's you! You all knew about it? Rui told us the whole story. If it's like that, ... We got the 6 billion back right away. We're sorry, we're sorry. We're sorry we had to keep it a secret from you. No, you clearly are the best! Huh, where is Hanazawa Rui? You know, Rui is kind of self-conscious. Then, let's go. At the end we have a present for you. He? Makino Makino, wake up. That can't be true. He? What's this? From now on there will be the wedding ceremony produced by F4! You... The greatest pair we have to give a great wedding ceremony. Nishikado-san... Become happy, Makino! Mimasaka-san Thank you. Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Ken... Now, for the entrance of the bride a grand applause please. Switch on. Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Tsukushi-chan, congratulations! Tsukushi, congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Thank you. Big sister, you look pretty. The two of you, congratulations. He? He? Rui! He, what are you doing? The oath of the two of you... Somehow I thought I should be the one to take it from you. That isn't like you to do something like this. I told you I was thinking about what to do when you leave everything to me. He? What is with you, Rui. So that's how it is. hey, hey. What are you talking about? It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. The two of you, congratulations. I really wanted to say to you face to face. Thank you Hanazawa Rui. You guys... To come together for this. Then, the exchange of the rings. Groom, Doumyouji Tsukasa. Do you swear to take Makino Tsukushi as your partner for life and make her happy? I swear. Bride, Makino Tsukushi Do you swear to take Doumyouji Tsukasa as your partner for life and love him? I swear. Then, the kiss of your oath. One year later It has been long. He...? Nishikado-san? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Nishikado-san! Wait! We have been making mistakes for all this time but we don't want to keep on doing evil things from now on, I only do things that are just and honorable. My name is Akira Mimasaka! ??? In life it is just normal to say "goodbye" Hey, You still haven't told me what your dream is. Is there really nobody for Doumyouji who is more important than me now? Ha? Of cause there isn't. Don't talk that crab. From now on also? Whatever happens? It's true that I gave you the oath that time but I have no problem to do it here again. But I think for me it's also ok to be the second. Ha, what is that? It also may be that Doumyouji becomes second for me. You... what are you talking about? When you grow up, I hope you won't be like me! (in Doumyouji's way of speaking) Ha? But curled hair would also be ok. Eh? My dream already came true. Thats unbelievable!!! WE MADE IT!!!!! WE MADE IT!!!!! WE MADE IT!!!!! WE MADE IT!!!!! Our story doesn't end here. It begins from now on. Thank You Jin-Subs
