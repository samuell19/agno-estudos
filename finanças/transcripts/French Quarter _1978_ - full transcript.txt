- CHRIS, WE'RE JUST GOING OVER YOUR FATHER'S ESTATE AND ACCOUNTS. AND NEAR AS I CAN FIGURE, WHAT WITH SELLING THE BOAT TO COVER HIS DEBTS, AND THE TAXES ON THE COTTAGE, YOU'RE JUST ABOUT $3,000 IN THE HOLE. OF COURSE, THERE'S THE ACCOUNTING AND MY LEGAL FEE ON TOP OF THAT. - SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE GIRLS WHO COME ALONG ABOUT AS OFTEN AS SNOW IN THE BAYOU. AND SHE WAS ON THE RUN. I COULD TELL THAT. HELL, GIRLS LIKE THAT ARE ALWAYS ON THE RUN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. SOME OF 'EM ARE RUNNING FROM SOMETHING. SOME ARE RUNNING FOR SOMETHING. SOME ARE RUNNING TO SOMETHING. SOME OF THEM ARE JUST RUNNING. AND AROUND HERE, THEY ALL RUN TO NEW ORLEANS. THEY CALL IT "THE CITY THAT CARE FORGOT." [wolf whistle] THE FACES NEVER CHANGE. THE STORIES NEVER CHANGE. AND THE FRENCH QUARTER, HELL, THE FRENCH QUARTER STAYS THE SAME. KNEW HER? YEAH, I KNEW HER EVEN BEFORE I SAW HER. SHE LOOKED AROUND FOR A WHILE, DID A LOT OF WALKING, DID A LOT OF SITTING. THEY ALWAYS DO THAT, WALK LIKE THAT, SIT LIKE THAT. LIKE BIRDS WHEN THEIR CRUMBS ARE THINNIN' OUT. SHE WAS LOOKING FOR HER DREAMS IN THE TIMES-PICAYUNE. MAN, THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW ABOUT NEW ORLEANS: ANYBODY THAT WANTS SOMETHING REAL BAD IS GONNA GET IT REAL BAD. CHRISTINE DELAPLANE WAS THAT RARE GUMBO, A MIXTURE OF HALF CHILD, HALF GIRL, AND ALL WOMAN. NOTHING REALLY STOPPED HER. SHE TRIED EVERYTHING. SHE WAS SO SIMPLE, SO VULNERABLE. IT MADE HER A SNAP DETAIL. THAT'S ME, IN CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED, IN THE STRIPED SWEATER. SHE HAD THAT LOOK THAT MADE MEN ACHE, MADE THEM WANT TO DO SOMETHING THEY KNEW THEY SHOULDN'T. BUT I JUST HELD BACK, LET MY EYES DO THE WALKING THROUGH THAT YELLOW HAIR. I KNEW IT WAS COMING. A GIRL LIKE THAT, IT HAD TO. SHE TRIED. ANKLED HERSELF INTO EVERY RAT HOLE OF THE VIEUX CARREZ-- THAT'S WHAT THE LOCALS CALL THE FRENCH QUARTER-- LOOKING FOR THAT JOB, AND I JUST HUNG ON WATCHIN' LIKE A GATOR EYEBALLING A SWAMP BIRD, WAITIN' FOR THAT STRIKE. SHE HAD GUTS, BUT IT WAS A LOSIN' GAME. - CAN I GET SOME LUNCH, PLEASE? - IF YOU CAN DRINK IT. - UH, I'D LIKE A OYSTER SANDWICH. - KITCHEN'S CLOSED. YOU WANT A BEER? HEY, LISTEN. YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH. I JUST HAVEN'T HAD MUCH SLEEP, THAT'S ALL. - WELL, HOLD YOUR HAUNCH. I'LL SEE IF I CAN BANG YOU UP A CHEESE SANDWICH. IS THAT OKAY? - THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC. YOU KNOW, YOUR SIGN OUT FRONT SAYS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOME HELP. - I AIN'T. HE IS. - THOMASON, BURT THOMASON. IDA SAYS YOU'RE AN OLD FRIEND. COURSE I DON'T BELIEVE MUCH WHAT IDA SAYS. - I'M LOOKING FOR WORK. - YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID. HOW OLD ARE YOU? - UH, 21. MY NAME'S CHRIS DELAPLANE. - PLEASED TO MEET YOU. - WHAT IS IT EXACTLY YOU DO? - WHAT IS IT EXACTLY YOU WANT DONE? - YOU EVER DONE ANY COOKIN'? - COURSE I HAVE. - CLEANIN'?

AND THE SORES ON IDA'S, THAT'S FROM BAR CLEANING. - YOU WATCH YOUR MOUTH, OR I'LL SHOVE THESE FINGERS WHERE THE MOON DON'T SHINE. HE'D LOVE IT TOO. - I NEED A JOB. - YEAH. AND I NEED A TOPLESS DANCER. - OH, WHY DON'T YOU KNOCK IT OFF? - I SUPPOSE YOU'VE DONE SOME OF THAT TOO. - I CAN DANCE. - YOU SURE NEED A JOB BAD ENOUGH TO MAKE ME GUESS YOU AIN'T GOT SLEEPIN' MONEY FOR THE NIGHT. MAYBE NOT ENOUGH TO PAY FOR THAT SANDWICH. - YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE ME THAT JOB. - WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I THINK I MIGHT LOOK AROUND A WHILE. I JUST PUT THAT SIGN OUT. I GOT TO ADMIT, YOU GOT THE ROUGH QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE JOB. - CAN I HAVE THAT JOB? - WELL, I DON'T KNOW. YOU COME BACK TONIGHT, AND BRING SOMETHING TO AUDITION IN. LOAN. - THANK YOU. - HEY, YOU'RE ON NEXT. - HOW DO I LOOK? - AS SOON AS YOU'RE THROUGH, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

IT WAS A GOOD NIGHT. OOH, SHIT. DOUBLE SHIT. YOU TELL BURT YOU'RE OVER 21? HE WON'T TAKE ANYBODY WHO AIN'T OVER 21. - YEAH, I TOLD HIM I WAS OVER 21. - I CAUGHT HER ACT FIRST TIME OUT OF THE STARTIN' GATE AT BURT THOMASON'S STORYVILLE BAR. SHE WAS...DANCING? - WELL, I, UH, HOPE Y'ALL LIKED IT. - ALL RIGHT! HEY! DYNAMITE! DYNAMITE! RIGHT ON! - 20 MINUTES ON, ONE HOUR OFF. THAT'S WHEN YOU WAIT ON TABLES. SIX NIGHTS A WEEK, 12:00 NOON TO 4:00 A.M. - I THINK I SHOULD GO HOME. - YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. TRUST ME. YOU GOT A JOB, A GOOD JOB. AND I GOT A FEELING YOU'RE GONNA BE REAL GOOD AT IT. YOU'RE GONNA BE REAL, REAL GOOD AT IT. - AT DANCIN'. I'M GONNA BE REAL GOOD AT DANCIN'. AND AT DANCIN' ALONE! - WELL, YOU'LL COME AROUND. BEATS HUSTLIN'. - IT WAS ONE OF THOSE RAGIN' CAJUN MORNINGS, WHEN YOU COULD JUST FEEL THE STORM WAITING BEHIND THE SUN. AND THERE SHE WAS STOMPIN' DOWN DECATUR STREET, BIG AS LIFE AND MADDER THAN A MOMMA POSSUM WITH SORE TITS. - WHAT IS THIS CHECK FOR $25? I WANT MY MONEY. YOU OWE ME A WEEK'S PAY! - THAT'S IT. THAT IS YOUR MONEY, PLUS YOUR MEALS, THE ROOM UPSTAIRS, AND 25% INTEREST FOR THE LOAN OF THE COSTUME. AND YOU WANT TO WATCH HOW YOU TALK. - IF THAT'S THE WAY IT IS, THEN I QUIT. JUST GIVE ME MY BUS FARE HOME. JUST GIVE ME MY BUS FARE BACK HOME! - YOU GOT A CHECK FOR $25. - MR. THOMASON, THIS IS SATURDAY. THE BANKS ARE NOT OPEN ON SATURDAYS. - SO HANG AROUND. BESIDES, WE DON'T CASH CHECKS HERE. - MR. THOMASON. MR. THOMASON! - NO! - ON DELPHINE STREET, NUMBER 38. NUMBER 38, THERE'S THIS WOMAN WHO OWES ME. FLORINDA BEAUDINE. BEAUDINE.

NO SWEAT. SO STOP FRETTIN', YOU HEAR? SHE'S ALSO INTO VOODOO. AT LEAST SHE WAS. SHE'S HARMLESS, THOUGH. - HELLO? ANYBODY HOME? HELLO?

IT'S MY SPECIAL BLEND, AND I MADE IT MYSELF, AND IT'S DELICIOUS. - IDA SAYS THAT YOU-- - NOW, YOU JUST SLIP OFF YOUR SHOES, SIP THIS TEA. RELAX. MADAME BEAUDINE IS GOING TO SOLVE ALL YOUR PROBLEMS. - IDA SAYS MAYBE THAT YOU CAN CASH MY CHECK FOR $25. - NO PROBLEM. I'LL GET YOU BACK HOME. NOW, TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF, HMM?

THERE WE GO. - I KNEW WHAT WAS COOKIN', ONLY THE CAKE WASN'T READY TO COME OUT OF THE OVEN. SO I WAITED. THAT'S HOW I MAKE MY MONEY, WAITING. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I GET A FEELING IN MY BONES I'VE BEEN WAITING 100 YEARS. BUT THEN, TIME HAS LITTLE MEANING IN THE FRENCH QUARTER. - IT'S ABOUT TIME. HELLO? IT'S ME. YEAH, THE PACKAGE IS READY FOR DELIVERY. JUST GIVE ME A FEW DAYS TO HOOK IT UP. THE BUYER SHOULD BE VERY PLEASED.
