These bastards made us become refugees by kicking us out of our lands. This country is ours as well, Even if we don't belong to the same origins. - You got a light? - No. You don't talk much. When did you join this group? One year and a half ago. The longest, with the boss. Were you just the two of you at the beginning? There were eleven when I arrived. How about the others? The ones who die? We replace them with guys like you. There, it's set for tomorrow morning, When the two big buildings are full of people. Doma, you are in charge of the grey building. Tanza, you'll hide this one in the yellow building. Let's go! Get inside! No laughing! Sailors sail the whole world over. Travelling there where happiness reigns. Sailors sail the whole world over.

Damn, she'll die waiting for tomorrow! Merima? The one whose nose looks like a gun handle? Go ahead and laugh! When Silvana comes she will kick your ass kung fu style. You're flying straight into another prison. Your two large bulging eyes fly like... What about you, you poor thing? Another month? A month and a half. And then, straight to the paint shop. I'll say: "Mister, here's 100 dinars for some glue. My sneakers are falling apart, I got no money to buy another pair." When that stuff kicks in, all the Merimas, Silvanas and Sekas will be buzzing like bees around my head! It's like you're sorry to be leaving. Me, sorry? You must be joking! If you're good in here, you can achieve what you want and as much as you want, and you can even stop when you want. Out there you have to play by the rules, you can't stop when you want, even if you're a good guy. Baldy! Baldy! Goaaaaal! What d'you expect, you moron? Us to play while you sleep? I'm gonna kill you! Leave him! He's not worth it! Don't you worry. There won't be a scar. Not until your dad whacks your head with a bottle again! Come on! I'll straighten up those teeth and legs of yours! I'll smash your head in, karate style! Cut it out! Get back on the pitch! What's up? Are you high? Where did you get the glue from? Glue? I don't mess with my head! We're out of here tomorrow! No more of these idiots, No more "Do this! Do that!" and guards having a go! Freedom, man! At least there are guards here! Out there, no one protects you from certain bastards! Where to, dear?

They even shot 50Cent in his face, I heard he spit the bullet back out with his mouth. Well, Game was shot point blank in his damn chest! Without a bulletproof vest, too. I don't care what you say, 50Cent can't be stopped. I bet you 5 dollars, if they would stand here, Packing nine, shoot at point blank, I bet 50 would go down first. That's stupid! No, you stupid, Blanca! I'm not the one got left back, you did. La Queeta. She played you. I didn't get left back. Why you lying? They just put me in the wrong grade. I was too old, and now I'm doing it over again. Right. Yeah, OK, whatever... But I bet if B.I. G and Tupac came back from the dead. They would say to 50Cent and the Game. Why you nigga so stupid?

Please clam down. Calm down?... You have a kid who has AIDS in this school, and you want me to calm down? You don't know that she has AIDS. What if she sneezes on somebody? Or gets her sweat on somebody? That's absurd, you can't... What do you know? What do you know? You obvious know something I don't. This is a very sensitive issue. You can't have a kid like that in school without letting the parents know. I assure you, if there is anything wrong, if there is any danger, The parents would be the first to know. You got to quarantine her or something. I am not saying that she is infected, as a matter of fact... I am not at liberty to talk about anything concerning a student. Then I'll ask her myself. What's your problem? You sick or something? You got something to tell? Will you please stop? Look at me when I'm talking to you! I don't know what kind of broken home you come from... - Stop it! - But I'm not your mama... - You have to get out of here! - This is enough!

Blanca, honey, you go back to class, too. And where do you think you're going? Leave her alone. You have done enough already, my god! Hey, Blanca... How do you supposed to get a boyfriend now? Who's crazy enough to kiss someone with the AIDS? You're not coming to the school no more, right? Yes, she's coming, but she's going to be in one of those plastic bubbles. How did you get that anyway? Are you gay or something? You see her mother and father? They look like those zombies from Michael Jackson's Thriller. Her Mama's a crack head junkie. Her Daddy's too. Is she coming back to school? Then I'm going to a different school. One where they don't have those nasty diseases. Why don't you girls go home? - Go on. - Stupido. Like I said... You OK? I'm OK, thanks. You go home now, OK? I see you later, you come back with your father, I give you some ice cream. OK. 'Don't give HIV a chance.' I'm just saying that if you take that medication with us... That's all you keep saying... This medication, that's all you keep talking about, you don't listen to me, I don't believe in medication. Why? 'Cause it's bullshit! It's bullshit, baby. You're killing Blanca with that medication, you're destroying yourself. Look at you, you used to be beautiful, now look at you! It's not because of this medication, I'm on methadone, too. The same thing, the same people! The same people give you the methadone give you the medication! It's all bullshit! I didn't come back from Iraq, to die from some fucking medication. Oh, my god, I'm so tired of this Iraq thing with you! You are just like us, Sammy. You got AIDS, and you got HIV And hepatitis B and C, so what are you gonna talk? You don't even wanna admit that you got the same things as us. You don't even wanna admit that you gave me AIDS. Fuck you! Don't put that on me! Who else? Don't you put that on me, you could've gave me the virus. I was virgin when I met you, I didn't even do drugs before I met you. Come on, virgin? You don't think I heard about you when I went away? You don't think I hear things? When you went away, I wasn't with anybody else. You're the one who came back and fucked the entire project! Because fucking you is like fucking the medicine cabinet, that's why! Fucking me is like fucking a medicine cabinet? Yes! Yes, it is, now you know, yes it is. Maybe you shouldn't have infected me! You gave it to me, and I gave it to our daughter. What the funk? Blanca? Baby, what are you doing there? How long have you been there? Blanca, what happened? What happened to your head? I was in a fight. With whom? I'm gonna die. What? What are you talking about? Did the nurse tell you that? Everything everybody said about you are true. You're junkies. No, no. Baby, you don't understand. Listen... You don't understand. Everybody's been teasing me that I'm an AIDS baby. I got beat up at school today. Don't touch me! It's OK, alright? You're not gonna die, OK? Come here... You're gonna listen to Mommy, take your medication. OK? What's the point? My life is over. No, don't say that. It's not, baby, OK? Look at me. Baby, please.
