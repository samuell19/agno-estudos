[shriek] [interposing voices] Oh, Lord, son of God almighty, I beseech thee, heed our plea. [shuddering] Accept into your divine grace tormented prayers of these, your worshipful servants. Can you not feel it, children-- God's presence. Perhaps they are possessed. [gasping] Yes! Perhaps the Devil orders them [inaudible]! [gasping] These innocents are afflicted. They are not possessed. What affliction? [scream] Get away! Get away! Get off. It's biting me. Biting me-- it's biting me. Stop! Get away! Get away! Child, fear not. Be-- be not afraid. GIRL: It's biting me. [scream] Ye are in a house of God. [scream] Be not afraid. What afflicts you? A witch! [gasping] A witch-- a witch afflicts me! [chatter] Where be this witch, child? [moaning] REV. SAMUEL PARRIS: What say you, child? There is the witch! She is! [screaming] Let me go. [crying] [interposing voices] [screaming] Remove her! Let me go. Stop her! Stop her right now. No! You dare accuse me! [screaming] Stop her! Stop her! Stop her! [screaming] Get the witch away. She'll infect us all. Daughter! Mama! Shh. I am but a poor beggar woman. You know that, Goody Osborne. Say something. You are mistaken. Let her go! Goody Osborne! Goody Osborne-- She's a witch. [interposing voices] [screaming] Goody Osborne! Come, children. Children, you have no choice. [screaming] [cackling] Stop! Save us, Reverend. The Devil is here. Children of God-- [screaming] [inaudible] REV. SAMUEL PARRIS: --the forces of the Devil are lurking within our flock. Betty-- Tituba! A witch! Tituba is a witch! [interposing voices] No. She's right. Tituba is a witch. [cackling] [screaming] [crying] [music playing] Fire, fire-- fire in the village! MAN: Where is it? Fire-- fire in the village! What's happening, father? Where is it, father? You should be in bed, all of you. It's down in the village, the Walcott farm. Heaven protect them. Are you going? Not even if it was across the road. That isn't Christian, father. Lizzy-- thy father did not ask thee to speak. Go on to bed. It is not with God's teaching. Lizzy-- That makes my Walcotts are kin to Thomas Putnam. He will soon have me in flames as welcome my help in extinguishing them. But why? They are Puritans like us. These are complicated times, child. We are Puritans. That just meant we are knit together in all ways, in pleasure and pain, feast and famine, as one body. [knocking] Samuel, there is a fire. Might it be Indians? Protect the children, Elizabeth. [voices in the distance] Lord, I have fear of this night. Put your hand on me. Put your hand on me. [interposing voices] MAN: Samuel, join the line. There's more goats in there. [interposing voices] [horse neighing] [screaming] Come on, now, push harder. [moaning] Push-- that's it. - No more. No. Come on, Goody Putnam. Push for the new baby. [crying] MIDWIFE: Come on, push-- one more time. MAN: Fire in the village! If it's Indians, they'll kill everybody. MAN: Fire in the village. Isn't so, Mercy-- my father's there. Is father gonna be killed by Indians? They killed my father, and my mother, and the children. [moaning] MIDWIFE: Breathe! Indians kill everybody one by one. [moaning] Annie, it's time. What are you standing around for, useless things? Maid, wash these clothes. Annie, don't just stand there staring, child. You're about to learn how to bring a baby into the world. Nathaniel, you stay there. Annie, fetch another candle. Harder-- that's it. Come on, now, Goody Putnam. Push for the new baby. I can't. Oh, why is this taking so long? Get in closer, child. I can't see me own hands in the shadows. [moaning] - Is she dying? Bring the candle closer. For God's sake, help me child. [moaning] Annie-- [screaming] [moaning] Annie, I see it! I think it's a boy. I think it's a big boy, Goody Putnam. It's a boy. It's a boy. It's a boy. [crying] Come on, come on. Come-- breathe. Come on, breathe. Breathe-- breathe. Come on-- breathe. [music playing] No. [crying] No! Still more animals in the barn. George, get the wagons. Help over there. Get the wagons away from there. Hold it. Make sure the horses are clear. [interposing voices] Here-- give me the calf. All right, I got it. [gasping] [gasp] More of the embers, here. You must not despair, Jonathan. We'll have your new barn in no time. But what if May was right about the Indians? This was not the work of the Indians. I believe it was a Devil's spectre did this. Witchcraft? THOMAS PUTNAM: Aye. But I be a good Christian. Why would I be plagued by witchcraft? Thomas Putnam-- Goodman Putnam, you're needed at home. The baby, it was born still. Never took a breath, poor thing. [music playing] Was it a son? Goodman Putnam, the child-- he is not alive. Shall I tell you wife you are returning? May our Lord be with you, Thomas. [music playing] He'll be along. Thomas-- What if Goodman Tarbell was right about the spectres, and now this is a dark force with us? [music playing] GOODY PUTNAM: Annie-- Annie? Yes, mama? Bring him to me. I want to hold him. No. No, mama. I don't want to. You tempt Satan when you disobey. Bring him. [music playing] [whimpering] [SINGING] Alas my [inaudible]. You [inaudible] me to go [inaudible] [crying] My home holds another son that has died. It is a grief I've known before, yet the pain of it still cuts as sharp as the first. You know this. We have all lost children. Aye. And we all share your sorrow. Aye, Thomas. God bless you. God bless you. And Goody Putnam, Thomas-- Which is why I have come here to appeal to you neighbor to neighbor, Puritan to Puritan. On a single night, our village has lost a barn to fire and a child's life. Forces of darkness are upon our village-- our village. I am asking for your support of our minister. Our minister? Half the village worships in town as they always have. And it is time that we split from the town. Split from the town? They no longer serve the village's interests. The village's interests? Don't you mean the Putnams' interests? It was the Putnams who brought Reverend Parris to the village and gave him land under the meeting house. That was village land. That was not yours to give away. The village committee voted it. Your village committee made up of all your brothers. This is the stubbornness that has driven away our last two ministers. It is your stubbornness that brought in the third. You had no right to give away that land. If indeed dark forces have descended upon Salem Village, what will happen if we are not united to meet them? [music playing] [inaudible whispering] I want to walk with my mother. Shh-- hush thy noise. It is thy baby brother we're burying. Joseph Putnam has his eye on thee. Bite your tongue, May. Pray he does not trip walking backwards like that. [giggling] Shh Elizabeth-- [music playing] MAN: Let me take him now. [interposing voices] GOODY NURSE: Yes, I shall. MAN: Yes, dear. Bring these biscuits to the children outside, Tituba. Yes, ma'am. Dear Ann, have you taken food? No. I've no need for it. And prayer? Surely the need for that has not left you. God is waiting to hear you. Isn't he, Reverend Parris? He awaits us all, Goody Nurse. Come. Show your faith, Ann Putnam. Almighty God-- Mighty God-- Israel Porter cares less about his faith than making money in Salem Town. He and John Proctor both. They're even discouraging others from paying their church taxes. We promised the Reverend 30 cords of wood in salary. As it is, he'll be out of wood by the Sabbath. If they can't support him, we, the village committee, must force the collection. Have pity. [distorted interposing voices] It, It, Why are you taking him? Please don't. Please-- stop. Ann, enough. [music playing] Three of my babies dead at birth. You are Christ's ambassador. Please tell me, why is God doing this to me? Why? Why? What kind of man would you like to marry, Mercy? A butcher. A butcher? Yes. And we'll live in town and every night go to bed with a full belly. [laughter] I'd like to marry a tailor like Goodman Cummings, a husband whose hands are fine and always clean. Always clean-- [laughter] --cleaner than your own then. And how should that look? [laughter] Stop it. It isn't true. [laughter] Stop it. Shh-- listen. Do you hear that? [whistling] It's a woodpecker. It can't be. It's not the time of year. [whistling] [whistling] It is William Proctor. You had us fooled, William Proctor. WILLIAM PROCTOR: [whistling] He can mimic any bird you can name. Ask him. Not any. Can you do a horned owl? [owl sounds] [laughter] A wood thrush. A whipper willow-- please, William. Can you do a lovebird? [whistling] [giggling] [whistling] [laughter] [music playing] Stop it. It is sinful. Stop it. But it's fun. Slothful merriment is the Devil's pastime. It is sinning. [interposing voices] Annie, it was only fun. It is against God's will. [music playing] [shouting] And hope the possibility move you to be forgiven. Shame on you! [interposing voices] I have done nothing wrong. Let me be! This is madness! I have done nothing wrong. [interposing voices] GILES COREY: You will face chains and come back pure! I've done nothing wrong, Giles Corey. Go and be changed! Puritans! [interposing voices] Puritans! We are a people chosen specially by God. When you fail him, you open the door to Satan. [crying] With your unseemly speeches, you open the door to Satan. With your theft, you open the door. You are a sinner. With your unholy fornication, you are sinner! With your doubts about God's presence, you are a sinner. You will be taken from village to village so that all can see your sins. And by this public humiliation, you will be purged of your private weaknesses. And may God be with you. Mary, Mary, take this amulet. I've done nothing wrong. It will keep harm away. Bridget Bishop-- you keep away from her, you filthy hag. [interposing voices] No you won't, Mary. Stay away from me. Get away. - [inaudible] Get away. Not thou witch woman-- not thou witch woman. Know ye this-- as you make your journey, the pain you are suffering without the spurious comfort of amulets wrought on the anvils of witchcraft is for your own salvation. And therefore it is righteous. [neighing] [shouting] [interposing voices] [music playing] Sinners! Shameful sinners! Sinners! Shameful sinners! [music playing] Tituba, Indian, do you have any scraps for us today? My little girl is famished. Come back later, Goody Good. Tituba give you food then. You're a good Puritan, you are, taking care of your poor Christian neighbors-- not like the others-- like you, Goody Walcott, casting your own hungry neighbors out in the cold. Do you answer to Satan? Quiet, you old harridan! You're crazed in your intellectuals. 'tisn't true! 'tis. Burned until you are dead. Tituba, is it true-- a fever will burn your brain away? And your soul too, unless you've been baptized. Tituba? Betty, child, the pox will not come here. The cards told me. What cards? The cards my shaman friend in Barbados taught me to read to tell the future. The ones that will tell if we'll be scalped by Indians. Scalped? Except for you, because then you would be an orphan like Mercy Lewis. Abigail, you mustn't scare your cousin anymore. Listen to Tituba. - Mama, what is an orphan? - Shh. Am I one? Quiet, children. You must not speak unless you're all dressed. But mama-- Enough. I must go rest, Tituba. There's a distemper in my head. It feels that it will burst. Is it consumption? Pray that it is not. Ma'am, we're almost out of wood again. I shall mention it to the Reverend. [coughing] Mama, am I an-- MARY GODFREY: Please, Reverend, I have done my penance. That is enough, Mary Godfrey. Show me your obedience. Please, Reverend, I have confessed to my guilt of unseemly practices. I did covet a bolt of fabric. My husband struck me for it, and I did strike him back. [whispering] Will you not forgive my sins? I wish to be part of this church. You plead to me with words. But by your actions of lustful covetousness, you have chosen to align yourself with the Devil. This church does not harbor sinners. [interposing voices] I have sinned. Now I have repented. Why won't you hear it? Mind your place, wife. Where's your forgiveness? Can you honestly swear before God that you have never sinned yourself? [gasps] [chatter] Sinner, if you are resolved in your way, be assured, you are going to dwell with the devils and the damned and be tormented by the flames of hell where you will be filled brim full in body and soul with the wrath of God. [whispering] Come, wife. MARY GODFREY: Let go of me. Bring shame upon our house. [interposing voices] Who next who wishes to speak? I do. REVEREND PARRIS: Speak, Ann Putnam. I fear there is some weakness in my conviction. I-- I know not why, for I am righteous and diligent in my prayers. But something-- something in my soul is stained. And this is why they die. What have I done? Please-- please lead me to what I have done so then I could find forgiveness. Heaven is large, Ann Putnam, if you are virtuous enough. Yet there is but one way into this happiness. It is narrow with a little gate. And if you miss this gate, you lose all your labor and shall never come to salvation. Do not lose your faith, Ann Putnam. But can't you tell me what I've done? Do not lose your faith. The Lord has given us a gift of much s to do. But we must also take time for ourselves to do nothing-- like this. Walk. It helps ease the heart, make you forget. And what will make my body forget? My breasts are still full of milk for the child. And my arms ache to hold him. How much walking until my body forgets this? The good Lord will not let us suffer forever. Have faith in that. Faith. Faith. He said school should only be a place where children learn the three R's. Samuel-- Samuel-- have you not heard a word? Samuel. What else can I do for these people? Children, let us say grace. Is it not enough for him to sue me for my land for all these years? Now Thomas Putnam is ordering my wood to be taken for the minister's salary. How much wood are the Putnams themselves tithing, if any? 'tis all anyone is discussing. Have you the oil of flax seed and the root of a bean? I've never heard of it. It cures distemper of the womb and solves the mystery of a stillbirth. MAN: I could find it for you. There is no transcendence in suffering. [music playing] [door closing] Huh? [music playing] Bridget Bishop-- Bridget Bishop, will you receive me? I am Ann Putnam. I know who you are. I am afraid. Then turn to your God, church woman. Pray for your mercy there, not here. I have tried. Know you what people call me? You would be excommunicated if found here. Are you not afraid of hell? I care not that you are called a which. And I am already in hell. Please-- tell me why my children are dying. You know the answer. I am not a witch, although 'tis what I am called. But I will tell you something that no one else has uttered to you. You are not to blame. Thank you. Come inside, and I will tell you all I know, Ann Putnam. [music playing] [dog whining] Wait for your father. [dog barking] Come on. Up here-- come on. There-- that's it. That's good. DISTORTED BARKING AND WHIMPERING Good, good boy. Good boy. There you go. [barking] [barking] Enough. [barking] Annie-- Annie, stop. Bridget Bishop is a witch-- Satan's witch, Satan's witch, Satan's witch. That's enough. This will stop. Satan's witch, Satan's witch. Everyone knows of her evil. Bridget Bishop is a-- - Hold your tongue-- - She's a witch. - --or you shall be struck. [barking] Stop it. [barking] [chatter] Those in arrears will be arrested. Arrested for keeping me own wood to myself? Can the Putnams do that? They are the village committee. They can do it. - Goodman Porter. Has your brother sent you to protect his notice? Are you gonna arrest me, Goodman Putnam? No. And I'm only half a Putnam, Goodman Proctor. 'Tis something I am reminded of almost daily. And it is not village business I wish to discuss with you. I've got this. 'Tis an Indian carving, the finest I have yet found. Might you give it to Lizzy? After all these months of admiring her, didn't you ever find a way to give it to her yourself? I could have, yes. But you wanted me to know that your interest in my daughter is official. Yes, sir. I did. It is. I will give it to her with my blessings. God be with you then. GOODMAN PORTER: And Joseph, I shall expect you to visit me sometime soon, an official visit. Yes. I shall, sir. Thank you. Did you feel the air shift just then? Everything has just changed. [music playing] Oh, look, 'tis Joseph Putnam. Where? He's come to ask for Lizzy's hand. Stop it. Stop it. There could be a hundred reasons why he would call on father. But only one that matters. [knocking] Shh. I believe Enid is right. You shall marry a Putnam. Stop it. And he's the richest of all of them. Both of you must stop. JOSEPH PUTNAM: Good day, Goodman Porter. 'Tis obscene to talk this way. [inaudible] - Good wife. Stop it. 'Tis enough. Shh. Lita, tell them to stop. Everyone knows that young Joseph has been courting you. And the flush on your face is confirmation enough. See? Even Lita knows it. - Shh. - Goodman Putnam-- [interposing voices] That is enough, girls. Good wife Putnam. But it's part a curse. A wife of his must cope with Thomas and Edward. Aye, and brothers-in-law such as these should be a constant chafe on a poor wife. But why, Lita? Why are they so hateful to Joseph? 'Tis heard everywhere. Why? Because his mother was not theirs. And she left most of her estate and all the Putnam lands to Joseph and Joseph alone. Aye, they shall never forgive him. And he has no other family. You shall be all of it for him now, my fine lass. [giggling] Oh, stop it. Over there is the port of Salem Town. You are aware of that, yes? Have you asked me here to give me a lesson in geography? Of course not-- the future, the future. Your grandfather and mine were the richest men in Salem. Yours, I believe, owned over 700 acres of land. It was that much, yes. And yet today, except for you, not one of the Putnams has enough land to support another generation. Yes. Hm. The Putnams believe that they've been wronged by their neighbors, and so they bring lawsuit after lawsuit. They believe that God has turned his back on them, and so they hire a new minister-- anything but to see the truth. New England's wealth will not come from the land. That is the future-- shipping, commerce, not farming. The Putnams hadn't been so stubborn, they would have seen this when my father did. I-- I mean no offense. None taken. I'm more outcast than Putnam. I know that. That is why I accept your request for my daughter in marriage as soon as you get around to it. I would like to offer you the future. Marriage-- may I? Rather, Goodman Porter, I would like to offer my marriage for your daughter's-- [laughter] --I mean-- It's all right. Your words are nonsense, but your meaning is clear. I accept your request. A father is blessed when he can make a marriage that is rich in love. And in this case, with the marriage of the Porter and Putnam assets, we shall bring in the future to us. I will not pretend that does not please me as well. No. No-- I forbid it, do you hear? A Putnam shall never marry a Porter-- never. JOSEPH PUTNAM: It's my right to do as I-- I am the eldest. I say what is right and what is not. Thomas, what do you to him? Leave us. Joseph wishes to marry Lizzy Porter. And And I shall. Upstairs, children. I do not need your permission for this or any other decision I make. Shout, strike me-- it makes no difference. [grunting] Thomas, have you lost your sense? This is Israel Porter's design to steal more of my land. He will trade his own daughter for it. You liar-- don't speak this of her-- Israel Porter was the executor of your mother's estate. Do you believe he's not been planning this for the 18 years of your life? Hold your tongue. You shame yourself with such slander. It is you who have wished me ill for all y years. [shouting] And if you raise your hand to me, I swear to God, you shall lose it. Thomas. [music playing] Oh-- [laughter] Oh, come now. 'Tis the first time I have written my new name. [laughter] One day it shall come as naturally as my old. 'Tis my greatest honor. [applause] Now all of you into the keeping room. We have pickles and spiced wine. [interposing voices] [music playing] WOMAN: In here now. [banging on door] Israel Porter! WOMAN: Don't worry about that. Please. LIZZY: Joseph-- You are too late. They are married. You shall pay for this, Israel Porter-- you and that thieving brother. There is naught you can do. Not your anger, not another legal suit-- you cannot harm them now. You shall pay for conniving against me, Israel Porter. Let God hear me now. You shall pay for this. [music playing] It is no less than a rot in this village. Has God determined that the Putnams shall inherit no more than an aggregate of loss? This is not the Puritanism that my grandfather came to Salem for. You were brought here to strengthen us, but you do not. You cast the glare of blame on me, but this is a time for patience. There is no time. The wolf is at the doors. I have scripted my sermons to lead and unite this community. And no one is listening. You were brought here to restore order. That is why we met each of your demands. We gave you the land that you sleep upon each night. We agreed to your salary. Agreed to it, aye, but have not yet delivered it. How can I pen the sermons we need when the very ink freezes on my quill? Where is my wood? Where is my order? You shall have your wood. And we shall expect the return to Puritanism that you were brought here for. [music playing] Ya-- [neighing] Ya! Are we going to hell? Shh-- 'tis a sin to listen to them like this. But I did not mean to listen. Quiet. Do no speak. Do not even think The Devil will hear you and will make you his witch. [music playing] What? A simple dearth of wood causes this frown? You doubt me still. You may say it, wife. I am afraid, yes. The villagers were to pay us in wood. Why aren't they, Samuel? [sigh] [sigh] Forgive me. [coughing] Elizabeth. I am afraid that it will not work out again for us, Samuel. And I haven't the strength anymore to start afresh. Will there be talk about us? Will I fail again? Hm? We need not discuss it. The past has made me stronger, Elizabeth. That is what you need to understand. The past has given me a knowledge of hardship that the two reverends before me did not have. And that is why they failed here, but I-- I can heal this place. I know you can. REVEREND PARRIS: There is a fear in this village, Elizabeth, that is stronger even than your own. They have a need of me. I can feel it. Hm? Rest assured. Stop! Stop! Give me the horse and that wood. What is he doing? Are you thieving? Do not stop. Keep working. Keep working. What is this? On me own land, you would steal the wood that I cut, and hauled, and split with me own hands? You owe a cord, Giles Corey. By order of Thomas Putnam and vote of the village committee, you have been assessed one cord of wood in taxes. What, a cord of wood? Well, I refuse. Put down that wood. Then you shall be arrested. Here is my order. Giles? [laughter] [music playing] Papa? [SINGING] Go to sleep, baby. Go sleep. Mama has gone to town. When she come back, she [inaudible]. So go to sleep, baby. Go sleep. Lust and carnal cravings stand side by side, always ready to cast their evil shadows-- [tituba singing] --on the righteous life of Jesus Christ. People lust. People lie. I am to make the difference between the clean and clean so as to confirm the one and purge the other. I shall be your guide on earth. I shall lead you to the narrow gate of heaven and into the grace of God for eternity. I know the sinners. And I know the righteous. People lust. People lie. Children lie as well. They are not too young to know evil. And they are not to little to die, so they are not too little to be damned. [gasping] Know ye this-- hell is a terrible place that's worse a thousand times than a whipping. And it waits for you. Betty, such a noise will bother your mama. She is sick now. Is it the pox? I told you no already. Go outside and fetch some more wood-- you too, Abigail. Um, but I don't want to. Betty, do as you're told. But Satan is outside. Annie Putnam said that-- TITUBA: You can't hide from the Devil. Inside or outside, doesn't matter. But I don't want to. I want to stay here. Are you Satan's child? 'Tis a sin to disobey. Ask forgiveness now. But mama, I am afraid. Both of you-- pray that you will not be stained by such manners. Do it. [coughing] In the love of all people, help us place my whole being in the hands of Jesus my redeemer. [interposing voices] By God, you men with your words-- you dared vote me off the village committee? Yes, and your brothers and cousins. You cannot steal our property. [interposing voices] It is time for new leadership, Thomas. MAN: Yes! [interposing voices] Our village must have its own minister. Tell us why. Have you not seen the erosion in our standings while Salem Town has grown-- [interposing voices] 'Tis against God's will! Master Putnam, you mistake your own self interest for God's will. [interposing voices] This hypocrisy must stop. Aye! Give him some of your own wood, Thomas Putnam. We already have a meeting house in Salem Town. You have gone too far. [crowd shouting] From this day forward, the Salem Village committee will consist of my brother, Joseph Porter. [interposing voices] - This cannot be. - My brother-in-law. [interposing voices] I will uphold the Puritanism of my grandfather. The Putnams will stand as one against those that would profit by it. If you are looking for a Putnam, sir, I'll give you a Putnam-- [whispering] --my son-in-law, Joseph Putnam. [cheering] You will not neuter me with your votes. [laughter] I am a Putnam. [music playing] What is this? Are you not well again? It is my head that is uneasy. I've heard that your brother's fury is not abated, that the village is split like a right mill and that-- - Shh. Wife, a baby will not want to be born into such a place as you make Salem sound. Do you fear I shall be as poor a committee leader as I am with your handwheel? [laughter] The village shall be as knotted as our flax. [laughter] Oh, if only our village were no more than the four corners of this room. Then imagine it is. And I shall never let harm into it. I am afraid, Joseph. It is not just Thomas's black air. Something is happening in the village, and all are aware of it. Tarbell's corn rotted overnight in its crib. And Abigail Williams says she saw a small bird that she swears was a witch's familiar. People saying that Satan has come to the village because it is impure. Do not listen to people talking. We must have been chosen. The fear is everywhere. I feel it myself. And with our child coming-- Shh. You are safe, Lizzy. And I would lay down my life to keep you that way. And what of your brother's anger? Do you not fear that? I fear only the thought that one day you will stop loving me. [music playing] Then you have nothing to fear in the world. THOMAS PUTNAM: With this petition, they've taken a new committee leader. Hm. Their first act will be to void the tax that pays your salary. And next they intend to reclaim the land under the meeting house. They believe it was unrightfully given to you. These are the men who would wage war on a Puritan minister. Said Yes. But this is far from over. We will form a new petition. [music playing] It is obvious that we need one. I have tried to be good. I have tried to be the man you asked me to be. God, I don't know how-- And what if God does not listen? [music playing] Did thou hear my question? If God does not listen, then we may as well not exist. Yes. 'Tis what I've been fearing these last weeks. Do not say it again. [music playing] These are the words of an infidel. It will snow tomorrow. There's a ring around the moon. These are not safe times, Ann. You must take care in your words. In front of you? In front of God. [music playing] Will thou touch me like a husband? You have not. Please let me know you do not blame me for this. To know that would remove the pith of my suffering when these weeks of prayers have done naught. Please comfort me, husband. And I shall bring thee another child. What comfort is it when it brings but stillness and grief to our home? Go to sleep, Ann. Go to sleep. [music playing] You shall feel better now with the warmth. Yes. I feel stronger already. It you. There's plenty of wood in the shed. Have you seen it? - Yes, yes. But I'm tired, Samuel. I must sleep. In time, Elizabeth, this will feel like our home. Will it not? Salem shall be our home when our congregation supports us of their own will. If it is not divine inspiration but threat of harm that moves them, Samuel, how does this bode for us? If they were divinely inspired, there would be no need of me. Threat of harm will be felt only by those who lack faith. Well, I do not want to lose everything yet again. I-- Perhaps God has brought me here, Elizabeth. He took away our farm in Barbados to give us this. Yes. My brother has my family's estate, but we have this, a chance to do God's work. You may lack faith in me. But perhaps God does not. [music playing] Watch it now, girls. What is it going to be? What is it, Tituba? Well, it looks like an apron-- cobbler's apron. No. 'Tis a scythe. Look at it here. Oh, yes, a scythe. You shall marry a farmer. A farmer. Wait. It has not finished turning yet. It has finished turning. 'Tis a scythe. Tituba. Coming, ma'am. Clean it up now, girls, before you get caught. - 'Tis my turn now. - Shh. Quiet, Annie. We shall be discovered. We must stop. Quiet. 'Tis my turn next. 'Tis the devil's game you play. Tell her, Abigail. God hears us. No one hears us, Betty-- no one. [music playing] [gasp] 'Tis a dead man's coffin. ANNIE PUTNAM: It hasn't finished turning. It has. No, she's right. Liar. It is a coffin. I told you. ANNIE PUTNAM: You liar. [crying] Betty? Abigail? [crying] ABIGAIL PUTNAM: 'Tis a coffin. ELIZABETH PARRIS: Abigail? - She's coming! - Throw it out! 'Tis too late. No one will know. God knows you have sinned. It is a coffin, because you have sinned. Throw it out! REVEREND PARRIS: Children! [crying] Quiet! REVEREND PARRIS: You have scared your mother. Witch! Look what you've done! You have sinned. And we shall go to hell because of you. [interposing voices] REVEREND PARRIS: Children! [crying] [screaming] What is going on? [screaming] [crying] What has happened here? Can you not speak? Help. What afflicts you, child? Child, calm thyself. Calm thyself. Niece, step here to help me. Are-- are they ill? What's happening to the children? Reverend-- I know not. My Betty and Abigail suffer in the same way. Niece, help me. [music playing] Oh, grace, please, someone tell me what's happening to my child. They are in fits, Goody Putnam. Annie, can you not speak? Mercy-- they were fine when they left here. What harm have they encountered while they were with you? Nothing. They were gathered to play some game. ANN PUTNAM: What game? I know not what game it was, but this is the result. Niece, bring me my medicines for God's sake. [gasping] It's biting-- it's biting my hand now too. [interposing voices] God in heaven defend us. Like animals-- barking, whining, foaming from the lips. I've heard unable to breathe. And more fall to the fits every day. I've heard five girls so far. I've heard Mercy Lewis attempted to burn herself in the fireplace. No. The way I heard it, she flew into it-- [gasp] --like a bird. She was trying to fly up the fireplace. It took two men to hold her back. Oh my-- oh my God, help this child. 'Tis witchcraft. Little Betty Parris has boils all over her body. Well, perhaps it's a fungus. What she needs is a poultice. No, no. 'Tis not fungus ails them. Nor are they poor innocents afflicted by witchcraft. They are possessed by the Devil. They are doing his work. You think they are witches themselves? [music playing] MAN: I think that should not be ruled out. [music playing] I beg you, sweet Lord Jesus, to save the souls of my beloved children. And I beg forgiveness for harm that I have brought to my family. Please forgive me. Oh, forgive me. 'Tis usually empty now. I-- I've come to pay my respects. Forgive me. No, please. Surely our Lord would rather hear your prayers than my cleaning for him. May I sit down? Of course. Are the children improving? I fear not. Some days, they give me hope. And they are in my prayers every day. Oh, I find such comfort here. Dear, good Nurse, I fear I am at fault. I led Satan to my door. 'Tis why these things are happening. Oh, Goody Putnam, you have received God's communion in this church. You are one of his chosen. No. I lost faith. My prayers were only words. I turned elsewhere for solace. Elsewhere? Yes. And I sought the comfort of an infidel. 'Tis why this is happening. I've told no witness. But the rot of it is festering inside me. And I pray that you tell no one. I should not have spoken. But the ache of my sins is too much to bear. Oh, Goody Putnam, God will not forsake you. You have received his communion. Now go to God. Reverend Parris will show you the way. Believe in him, and God will listen. Goody Putnam. I've got nothing for you today, Goody Good. It's not what I've come for. I wish to pay my Christian respects to the children. Annie's a good girl, and the maid too. Both are godly, and the village prays for them. Might you tell them that? Thank you. GOODY GOOD: Might we see them? Dorcas here made them a toy. Is isn't much, but we're poor. Of course. Come on. Mama? People have said it has been three days without a bite of food, and not even a word. Not a word known to humans anyway. Grunting like animals is what I heard. I made you a toy. Don't go near them. So you've come to taunt them with your stares? Haven't either, but I don't want my girl to be afflicted. How dare you? They are not witches. 'Tis not what's being said. Look at them. 'Tis not human. Satan possesses them. Get out. And hear me, Sarah Good, if harm comes to these children because of the black rumors of your tongue, ye shall be sorry. I promise you, ye shall be sorry. [music playing] Reject the refined power of my natural mind to live entirely to thy glory, to be deaf to unmerited censure and praise of men. Nothing can hurt my new born inner man. It can be smitten or die. Nothing can mar the dominion-- Who approaches? 'Tis I, Reverend Parris, Lizzy Putnam. I, um-- I-- I was hoping you would allow a moment to speak in private. About? Pray you do not think me crazed, Reverend. Speak, child. I can think nothing until you confess. I-- it was a dream I had. Woke me with a terrible fear, without breath, perhaps without my wits as well. Someone was there in my room. I was sure of it, but I saw nothing. And yet I knew with as much surety as you sit here flesh and blood in front of me now. What is happening, Reverend? Was it a witch or a familiar? I've-- I have heard of these, but I dare not speak of them to naught but you. We shall keep your secret between us. Unwarranted talk of witches and familiars breeds a rapid fear in a village. Lizzy, I have watched the devotion of your prayers on the sabbath. You are lovely of spirit and complexion. It is likely that Satan would covet one as pure as you. Then a I bewitched? No. Pray with me. Know ye that the godly bask in the fellowship of other pious people as well as in the light of God. TITUBA: [SINGING] I plant my jasmine garden. My jasmine smell so sweet. Jasmine, come when I call you. Jasmine, come when I call you. Jasmine, come when I call you. Jasmine, come when I call you. That is their favorite one, but they don't hear. They don't shut their eyes. They neither sleep nor week. There is talk they are possessed, but I don't-- Tituba, that is untrue. See to Elizabeth. Yes, master. [music playing] Speak, child. What ails you? You will answer me. Speak! The Devil is not here. He does not possess you. He does not possess you. Reverend. Hm? [inaudible] I came to pray for the children. May I? Oh, yes. Yes, yes, of course. We shall both pray. And in tandem, God cannot help but here our plea. Oh, Lord-- Oh, Lord-- --whose power is infite and wisdom-- --and wisdom-- --infallible-- Be not discouraged-- [inaudible] [crying] Why is this happening? Reverend Parris-- Reverend-- you are saving them. Yes, of course. Forgive me. Oh Lord-- - Oh Lord-- --whose power is infinite and wisdom infallible. --and wisdom infallible. I say this because hypocrites are the most diabolical of sinners. Christ said to his apostles, have I not chosen you twelve? Yet one of you is the Devil's disciple. And there are such disciples in this church. Ye sit here wearing the mask of piety, and yet are not pious. Ye are of your father, the Devil. And Christ knows. [music playing] Time enough, ye heretics-- time enough. Have but little patience, and ye shall see hell in time enough. No, no! [screaming] [interposing voices] [screaming] Say to me, afflicted girl. 'Tis Mary Warren, the Proctor's maid. [screaming] Stop it, stop it! I will not have this in my house. Children, get upstairs. Go to your rooms. Daniel, Sarah, all of you-- now. - [screaming] He's sticking me! [screaming] They're sticking-- Mary, you'll be out there on the post. I promise you, that's enough of this. You hear me? - Be gentle with her! Good Jesus, she is afflicted! No she is not. This is naught but fakery. Father, please! I'll throw you out in the street. You hear me, girl? - Please, please. You'll be as homeless as the day I found you. Please, please! [screaming] She is with child! MARRY WARREN: With child? 'Tis mine. [crying] [screaming] [crying] No improvement? It has been thus for days, with hands and legs flailing until we bound them to save her own bones. [inaudible] And when she stops, she's as still as death. [crying] Just like the others. You must do something, I beg of you. My own niece, and May Walcott. She's the ninth so far. I am sorry. Good To Reverend. God be with you. Naught to do but watch this suffering? We have prayer. Children are suffering. Our own daughter-- [screaming] Let us pray it be not in vain. Oh Lord-- [interposing voices] --son of God Almighty, I beseech thee, heed our prayers. Accept into your divine grace the tormented prayers of these, your worshipful servants. Can you feel it, children-- God's presence. WOMAN: Perhaps they are possessed! MAN: Yes! Perhaps the Devil orders them not to speak. [gasping] No! These innocents are afflicted. They are not possessed. What afflicts you? [screaming] Get away! Get away! Get off! Biting me! Biting me-- it's biting me! [screaming] REVEREND PARRIS: What ails you? What is it? Be not afeard. ANNIE PUTNAM: Get away! Ye are in a house of God. Be not afraid. What afflicts you? [screaming] A witch! A witch-- a witch afflicts me! [gasping] Where be this witch? There is the witch. She is the witch! WOMAN: SARAH GOOD: No! [screaming] [music playing] Remove her! They lie. Look at them. They are suffering! SARAH GOOD: They lie! Stop her right now. GIRL: Mama! SARAH GOOD: Dorcas! Get the witch away! She'll afflict us all! I am but a poor beggar woman. You know that, Goody Osborn. Say something. You are mistaken. Let her go! These girls are deluded. She means to harm us! You must not listen to these creatures. Goody Osborn! Goody Osborn! No. GIRL: Goody Osborn-- she is a witch too! Lies. [screaming] [music playing] Stop this. [screaming] [music playing] Lies! Witch! Please stop. Stop! [music playing] Save us, Reverend. The Devil is here! Children of God-- Hear us, oh, God. Tituba, Tituba! Betty! It's all right. [music playing] Tituba! A witch! Tituba is a witch! [music playing] No. Tituba. [music playing] Betty-- Come on, come in. They're coming. Don't bring them in here. Hang the witches. Constable, uh, not this one-- not yet. Come here. Master, I don't-- [moaning] Why have you afflicted the children? I never hurt the children. I love them like they're my own. How long have you served Satan? I don't serve Satan. You have sullied my home from the beginning. You were a harbinger of damnation, witch. TITUBA: I'm not a witch. You-- you-- you were a force of Satan in my own home. No. You shall confess and purify us of this evil. I'm not a witch. I'm a good girl. [scream] REVEREND PARRIS: You lie! I speak for God. You shall confess or know the wrath of the almighty for eternity. You shall confess and repent, or you shall be struck down, I swear. [music playing] [whispering] Lizzy? Amen. Lizzy-- [gasp] I was afraid. I feared you had become afflicted. Well, your thoughts are often dizzying. You are naught but them. It will be over soon, wife. The witches have been exposed. And soon all three will be hanged from the gallows. And you will have naught to think about but a name for our baby. Do you not believe me? It will be over by tomorrow. But I cannot believe that. Tituba? Mhm. Why would the child still be crying for her? Is it not possible they've taken it the wrong way? She's not crying for Tituba, Elizabeth. She's crying because of Tituba. Betty will confront her tormentor. Then I should go with her. No you shall not. You shall tend to your illness. [caughing] It shall be but a day, Elizabeth. I shall draw confession from the witches, and we shall be purged. [music playing] Rest assured. There they are. [gasp] Ann Putnam-- God keep you, child. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. WOMAN: She spoke harshly to me. When she passed me, she cursed me for not giving her coin. And the next day, one of my hens died. [chatter] She bewitched them! You're a lying [inaudible]! Your hens are dying of the cold! [interposing voices] MAN: A witch's spell rotted my corn overnight. SARAH GOOD: Oh, that's absurd. MAN: For all I know, she burned down my barn. SARAH GOOD: That's absurd. [interposing voices] Sarah Good, I have found cause enough to have you tried as a witch. [interposing voices] You shall be returned to prison until the date of your trial. Trying Remove her. [interposing voices] [SCREAMING] No! [interposing voices] [commotion] Take care of her. Dorcas! Dorcas! GIRL: Mama! MAN: Come here. Shut your mouth. [screaming] You signed the death of me. I am not a witch! Do not place that witch so close to me. I am not as much a witch as you are, Sarah Osborn. And you shall both be hanging. You shall see soon enough. God is no longer in this world for us. Daughter! [chatter] I am innocent. Believe me. I am innocent. She's the witch there! Why are you hurting them? I do not hurt them. Look at them. They are suffering. Look at them. It bites. It hurts! She is-- she is my flesh-- my flesh-- [crying] I am innocent! REVEREND PARRIS: Tituba, Indian, are you a witch? [shuddering] Answer. [scream] The Lord almighty shall strike you. Do not strike me. REVEREND PARRIS: Answer, are you a witch? Yes! [screaming] [music playing] And Satan speaks to you. Yes. Is he speaking to you now in this very meeting house? Yes. [moaning] What doth he say? Answer for the sake of the children. The Lord almighty shall strike you. What doth Satan instruct you? To hurt the children. [gasping] REVEREND PARRIS: Hurt the blessed children? [music playing] [crying] MAN: Are there more witches? Ask her, ask her. WOMAN: Are there more witches? [interposing voices] WOMAN: Tell us. WOMAN: Ask her, Reverend. Tituba, are there more? Speak. Are there others? Yes. [gasping] There are other witches amongst us. [chatter] There are other witches amongst us. [music playing] Take this witch to prison, and let her await her trial. [interposing voices] MAN: The Devil walks with her! [interposing voices] [crying] What have you done to us? I have done nothing. No. We shall all be hung because of you, witch. I am not a witch! Witch! [moaning] You confessed, witch. No. He beat me. I had to tell him something. He beat me. You-- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it. Stop it. Stop. [crying] What is to happen to us? Let us out of here! What is to happen to us? Without repentance, they must be hanged. Unfortunately, there is no law, Reverend. Until the colonies have a charter, we cannot even bring them to trial, let alone hang them. These are Satan's witches. And we are civilized men. We have no legal authority. No time to wait on politics. We have been without a charter for four years. Today alone, two more girls fell into fits of affliction. There is word from Boston that Increase Mather is en route from the English even as we speak. If the King has not signed the charter, we wait another four years? Goodman, we must act expeditiously or our souls will be consumed. No, no. We must wait until Increase Mather has returned. Poor children, can you hear me? How can I save you? I am afraid. [music playing] Is that it? You are afraid too? Of what? Of us? [WHISPERING] God. What? God. God? You are afraid of God? Give me a deeper repentance, a horror I've seen, I dread of its approach. Help me to resolve in my heart. Make me thine alone. Give me a deeper trust which I may lose myself to find myself in thee, the ground of my rest, the spring of my being. 'Tis enough, Lizzy. Give me a deeper knowledge of thyself-- You need to sleep. --his savior, master, Lord, and king. Give me your deeper holiness-- Stop it, Lizzy. --in speech, action, in action. Give me-- What is happening? [crying] I'm so afraid. I'm afraid. Why? Why? I'm afraid. I'm afraid. I'm afraid. I will let nothing harm you. I'm afraid. I'm afraid not being pure enough for our baby. [crying] Shh. [music playing] [gagging] Heave. Heave. Heave. - Pull. Come on, boys. Come on boys, heave. That's it, guys. She's coming. - Coming. - She's coming. She's coming. - All right. Easy now, easy now. - There we are. - All right. Steady. That's it. [woman screaming] It burns me! She burns me! Get back here! Calm yourself, girl. I'm on fire! It burns me! May, what's-- What is the matter? Calm yourself! [interposing voices] May, calm yourself. I'm on fire. Oh, she's burning me. JONATHAN WALCOTT: May, quiet down, child. [interposing voices] It's your father! [interposing voices] Come out of there, girl. May, 'tis your father! Stop it! The witch is burning me. Your father. The witch is burning me. [interposing voices] I don't believe it. They say it's evil mischief. That's not mischief. Nothing human sounds like that. It's enough to make a sound man lose his intellectuals. JONATHAN WALCOTT: Calm down, girl. MAY WALCOTT: The witch is burning me. Shh, May. Shush, shush, shush. [interposing voices] Who afflicts you? Can you not smell my flesh on fire? Speak, May. Who afflicts you? Ah, shush, shush, shush. THOMAS PUTNAM: Who burns you? The witch! The witch! Stop it! What witch? Speak her name. MAY WALCOTT: [crying] THOMAS PUTNAM: Speak her name. I know the witch. I know who it is. [music playing] Bridget Bishop, come out. She's gone. [bird calling] She's turned herself into a bird. She heard us coming. She's a witch. She could hear us breathing from a mile away. [music playing] [laughter] Stay still. Annie, mind your soup. Draw more. Annie-- Annie-- mind the soup. Draw more. Child, you dare The your mother's request? [knocking] Mind the soup. Help me. Help me, Goody Putnam. They have come to arrest me. They have burned my home. I've been all night in the forest. Another night, and I shall die of cold. You can stop them-- please. Ann Putnam, you know I am not a witch. [hissing] I helped you, Ann Putnam, when you had nowhere else to turn, not even your God. And I saved you. I'm sorry. You can stop them! ANNIE PUTNAM: [hissing] Beware ye now, I say. Satan himself has announced his presence in Salem. From this day, the Devil and his instruments will be warring with double vengeance against our salvation. Remove these children from the Devil's shadow. Spare them anymore suffering. They have served Christ enough for one day. Can you see them, Annie? Can you see the spectres? WOMAN: God bless you, Mercy Lewis. Save us, Annie! [music playing] God bless you! God be with you. Bah, I don't believe it. 'Tis the girls making mischief, I say. Or perhaps it is worse. How do we know they are not the Devil's witches? How do we know they [inaudible]? Sherry, come out now. HUSBAND: There's nothing wrong with her. You take your hands away from me! Hear me. Do not harm her. [inaudible] Who accused me? I am a member of the church. I've received the Lord's communion. 'Tis the girls who are the Devil's agents. You'll see. Let me be tried. I will prove who is a witch. My good Reverend, how are you? Increase Mather, these four years have changed you little. Welcome home. The crossing was bearable, I trust? Only just. My advanced years become all too known to me on the sea. Oh, the only time I feel old is when somebody younger than myself starts complaining about the advancing years. [laughter] Here, please sit down. There are matters we must discuss before-- You bring good news, I trust. Actually, even before-- Have you failed in your mission? The charter is signed, is it? Colonies have their charter. Their majesties agreed to many of our needs. But-- - Excellent, excellent. I can imagine nothing more important than that this document should be signed. Can you imagine, Increase, how life has been here for the last four years without any form of government? I mean, it's been absolutely-- [interposing voices] No, no, no. Excuse me, sir. Not now. I'm talking to the-- WILLIAM PHIPS: Excuse me, sir. Who are you? That is my wife, Lady Mary Phips. I'm not referring to her. INCREASE MATHER: This is Sir William Phips. He is the new governor of Massachusetts. 'Tis the matter I was hoping to discuss. William Phips-- what, the adventurer? And he's going to be the governor of Massachusetts? By order of King William and Queen Mary. I assure you, a role will be found for you. There is no reason why your work in the colonies should have to be stopped. My work is for God, Mr. Phips. Sir. Reverend. Sir William Phips. May we have more wood on the fire? REVEREND STOUGHTON: Aye. My husband prefers a warmer room. INCREASE MATHER: Certainly, my lady. Splendid, my sweet. Ah, here we are. Before we start talking about, as it were, the-- the housekeeping, which I admit is as pressing as anything contained in the royal charter which happens to be lying here on my desk, what role do you envisage for me in your new administration? Witchcraft, Reverend. Witchcraft? The news of its invasion into the colonies much concerns England. Their Majesties will be watching us carefully to see that it is handled without undue disruption. The latest news is that the devil is not satisfied with just beggars and slaves. He has started to possess respectable souls. Obviously, his evil and which is deeper than we first imagined. God, God, bring us more soup. God-- Quiet, witch. Let Satan serve you. Please, Goody Good is sick and with child. Please, we need more soup. Please, we were-- wait, wait-- please. [coughing] Goody Corey, you have been accused? [coughing] Only a matter of time for this witch. Move, slave. That is her spot. You defend a witch? Are you a witch? Of course not. The girls lied. Then call her Tituba. She is no different than you. We're all as much witch as each other. [coughing] Goody Corey, is the word from outside? There are rumors this will be over soon. The fools-- they shall learn who be responsible. Over? Tell us what you know. Tell us. Please, we beg you. Yes. Please, please. There is a new charter and a new government. And-- and he will favor us? 'Tis the rumor. Oh. Did you hear that? He might favor us. He might favor us. [inaudible] --the perils, the temptations. Easy. We're getting close to Salem Village. There's a black bird up there. [bird calling] That would be expected. It's where birds are most comfortable. Do you mock me? I was merely offering a scientific hypothesis. Oh, you're a man of science. Is that it? I must admit, I take some comfort from the logic of it. And is that the way you intend to govern the state of Massachusetts, with the scientific logic as your guide? Rather a modern concept, isn't it, Reverend? In the hell in which we're about to enter, Sir William, I assure you that your scientific logic will have the impact of a jet of urine in the ocean-- rank and tepid at the outset, but it quickly loses its identity as it mingles with the far greater waves of faith and Godliness. CONDUCTOR: Pulling up. We are entering Salem Village, where the Devil has taken up residence-- the Devil. And not all your science will protect you or the inhabitants. We are in Salem to find the truth, Reverend. Can you honestly trust that you will be able to see with so much salt water in your eyes? I have reviewed the documents of the accused of witches. I was struck by how many of the complaints were filed by you, Goodman Putnam, perhaps a third so far. I shall not let Satan get a foothold in Salem. Two of the accusers live in your house. My own daughter is afflicted. Ah, but it is understandable why you are so vigilant. Gentlemen, shall we retire to my study? I was also struck, Goodman Putnam, by how many of the accused are of families engaged in prior litigation with your own-- land disputes, sir, other legal matters. I hope, Sir William, you are not insinuating that I-- Nothing, nothing. Oh, life is full of coincidences. They fascinate me. The governor is a man of science. Hmm. An evil hand is upon us, Sir William. There is no doubt. You have presided over the examinations of the accused, have you not? REVEREND PARRIS: Yes. It has been-- 26 examinations to date. 27. We examined another this morning. How many of those examined do you believe to be witches? 27. All of them? REVEREND PARRIS: Yes. Have they all confessed? Just one, but they-- 26 people have pleaded their innocence, and you have believed not even one of them. The guilt of the accused, Sir William, is beyond doubt. They have been examined very carefully. Examined for their witchcraft? REVEREND PARRIS: Of course. Or for their innocence? Governor, these are servants and wives of Satan. Their spectres have afflicted a score of innocent young girls. Their spectres? Have any of these witches transformed themselves into birds? Yes-- yellow ones. My daughter saw a black one-- Yes. THOMAS PUTNAM: --biting her. Those are the witches' familiars. They suckle from the young girls. Snakes? Yes, and cats as well. The girls have all seen them. And have any of these witches passed into the young girls' rooms during the night as these familiars? Even through locked doors. It is how they materialize. And that, for your information, Governor-- that is a spectre. Thank you. Sir William, the poor afflicted girls bend, and writhe, and suffer in ways that defy the laws of science. Yes, so I have heard. You shall see for yourself at the trials. Regretfully, I shall not. I am en route to the frontier. I must admit I have had my own experience fighting Indians than witches. For the time being, I shall place my deputy governor in charge of the trials. I should be glad to know what he finds. I shall remain your humble and obedience servant, as always. I wish you luck, Reverend. Gentlemen. Governor. You must immediately shackle all the witches in prison. This will help contain their spectres. Now, quickly. We shall see to it at once. I should like to see the children now please. REVEREND PARRIS: Please. The children are resting, I'm afraid. Their reflections caused so much conversation in Boston, I was very eager to study them for myself. They are not to be studied. They are neither curiosities nor-- I pray you forgive my wife, Reverend Stoughton. She has been ill for some time now. The fever makes her lose her senses. Elizabeth-- come this way. REVEREND STOUGHTON: Thank you. [walking up stairs] [laughter] Aw. [gasp] Children. They do not seem to be afflicted, not as I have heard. Well, there are times they seem normal. But as you see, they're quite thin. And except for the darkness under the eyes, the skin has turned disturbingly pale during the ordeal. [moaning] [coughing] Child, rest. Rest yourself. REVEREND STOUGHTON: Is this calm one your daughter? She is not calm, Reverend. Hm? Oh, yes, I see. Is this typical? She will remain like this for hours. Do you think I might ask for a candle? Certainly. [moaning] We will go for trial. I shall call the slave first. She confessed. No. No, leave the confessors until last. First we will call on those who think they can evade the truth. [music playing] SARAH GOOD: [moaning] Come on, it's coming. That's my love. [screaming] Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Now it's out. Sarah Good, you have a beautiful baby girl. That's it. Rest now, love. [baby crying] Bridget Bishop, are you prepared to confess to the crime of witchcraft? If she has a fever, you'll give her these herbs and water. Bridget Bishop. Bridget, God bless you. Let her know you love her. Bridget Bishop, 'tis your time for trial. I am guilty of nothing. [shouting] I know nothing of it. I do not even know this man. Liar! Witch! She's come to me in the night many times, with naught but a red corset above her waist. [shouting] BRIDGET BISHOP: I did not! I did not! And how did she get through your door? Her spectre flew in without making a noise, not a single sound. Who else but a witch could do this? It was not me. It was not me! Bridget Bishop, we have spectral evidence in this case. And you have heard the accusations of the girls. You have afflicted them. BRIDGET BISHOP: No. They are mistaken. They are mistaken. Must they mock me? Must they mock me? Stop this evil mischief! Stop it! [screaming] BRIDGET BISHOP: Stop! Stop this evil! [screaming] Stop. Stop-- stop them! Stop! Stop this! Stop! [gavel pounding] Why have you bewitched them? I do naught. But look at them. Did you not cast a spell over them? They are making mischief. And will you say that I lie as well? While my wife sleeps beside me, this witch flies in, puts herself on top of me. [crowd shouting] Bridget Bishop, confess, are you a witch? No! [screaming] Then why will no one speak for you-- not one person? [music playing] They are afraid to speak. WOMAN: Shameless spectre. WOMAN: Satan's servant. MAN: Hang the witch. REVEREND STOUGHTON: Bridget Bishop, the evidence against you damns you. You are hereby convicted for the crime of witchcraft. And you are to be hanged by the neck until you are dead. [screaming] [music playing] BRIDGET BISHOP: [choking] God take your soul. God take your soul. God take your soul. God take your soul. [music playing] [music playing] I shall pray for you, Ann Putnam. I shall pray for you. Ann Putnam, Ann Putnam-- Why? Ann. What is she doing here? Who? Go back to sleep, Ann. No, I dare not. I am plagued by what I find there. 'Tis too dark in here. Did you not see her? Who? I don't know. Are you sure you did not see her? I saw no one. Then 'tis a witch's spectre. She looks for me, awake or asleep. I fear I shall not escape her, get rid of her. It's in my thoughts. There is no forgiveness. Who means to harm us? A spectre-- a spectre-- the one-- the one-- white hair-- the one-- the one-- Who? --the one-- Who is it, Ann? [crying] There you go. Betty, who did this to you? Abigail, do you know? It was the old man. [crying] Reverend Stoughton? It was God. We were bad. We are leaving. The children can no longer stay here. We shall not return. Says What is this imputence? You cannot leave. The children are witness. No, they are children-- not witnesses, not spectacles, not things to be brought out and put on-- I will not bear this disobedience. --display for your purposes. They are children. Wife! Wait outside, children. Wait outside. You cannot leave. I am the minister. I've not been pained enough with a confessed witch under my own roof and two of the afflicted. You will not-- They are not afflicted. They are terrified-- of you. Your fever taints your thoughts. 'Tis your illness that provokes you to this-- No, the illness is in that meeting house. It is carried in upon your own fear. And in turn, you have infected this village with it. Can you not see what you have done? I am protecting from Satan's grasp. But they would not need protecting if the God you hear in your head offered compassion-- just that. Elizabeth-- Force me to stay, and I shall speak from my heart. And they have taken seriously ill-- both of them? Yes, these last few months became too much for them. Taking them away was my wife's idea. She felt that in their unhealthy state, the children would unfairly sway the judgment of the accused. There is order in your house. Is there not, Reverend? Yes, of course. Why should there not be? Won't you stop and hear me? Me poor wife is innocent. She's a church woman, same as you. Her only crime was to doubt. Neighbors, can you not see this? Can you not see that this is unholy mischief in this? Giles Corey, you are on trial for the crime of witchcraft. How do you plead? I shall not dignify this travesty with a plea. REVEREND STOUGHTON: Guilty or innocent? The court demands that you enter a plea-- guilty or innocent? Giles Corey, it is the law of the land that you must stand trial. Guilty or innocent? Answer! I order that the defendant suffer peine forte et dure until such a time as he change mind. Remove him. [chatter] Do you plead guilty or innocent? Another stone. [groaning] Guilty or innocent? [groaning] Three drops of water today, three morsels of bread tomorrow-- nothing more. [music playing] [groaning] [moaning] The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He maketh me to lie down beside still waters. He leadeth me in the path of righteousness. [moaning] How do you plead, Giles Corey-- guilty or innocent? Giles? Giles! [crying] Oh, no! No, Giles! [mumbling] He spoke, sir. Guilty or innocent? More weight. Another. WOMAN: Oh, his soul. This is dreadful. MAN: [praying] WOMAN: Have mercy on his soul. [music playing] MARTHA COREY: Our father, who art in heaven-- Our father, who art in heaven-- MARTHA COREY: --hallowed be thy name. --hallowed be thy name. - MARTHA COREY: Thy kingdom come. Thy will be fulfilled as well on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses even as we forgive our trespasses-- Martha Corey, will you confess to the crime of witchcraft? Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. REVEREND STOUGHTON: Do you confess, Martha Corey? For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever. REVEREND STOUGHTON: Martha Corey-- Amen. REVEREND STOUGHTON: --will you answer? Did you not hear my prayer? 'Tis false. It is my redeemer. I cannot. I cannot. Do not lose your faith, Ann Putnam. Faith in what? I am innocent! Is that God's love? It is hard for me as well, Ann. But it is a test for us. The path to our God is not easy. This is how we shall show our Puritanism. Now look, look. I cannot. Ann, stay strong. You do not want to show that you are weak in your faith. Look at it. Stop it. I can't. --do you confess to the crime of witchcraft? No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes! Yes, I confess. I'm a witch. [hyperventilating] [crying] Forgive me. I will lay myself before thee and beg for mercy. I confess. Reverend Parris, we will accord these unfortunate women one final chance of redemption, the evening prayer. Oh, lover of thy people, thou has placed my whole being in the hands of Jesus, my redeemer. [inaudible] They have sinned against God. This is their punishment. 'Tis God's will. His will, but where is God's forgiveness? They have sinned against us. Then where is your forgiveness? I shall pray for you, Ann Putnam. I shall not let you forget that you are one of us. 'Tis a curse. MAN: Ya! [horse neighing] [screaming] [gagging] Stop it! [crying] Stop it! You cannot! You cannot! [screaming] [chatter] Elizabeth? Elizabeth? I thought I could be helpful. I had heard that Goody Parris has-- well, I thought it would be better if you had only the writing of your sermons laboring your mind, not housewifery that I could help with. Do you mind if I-- if I came from time to time? No. No, Lizzy, you are welcome here. There has been a loneliness in this house I have not known before. [coughing] Where is he? Over there. [moaning] [crying] We shall all die from the stench in here. MAN: Another dead one here. Guard! Now there's room for the new ones. Here's another witch. No! [gasping] [whispering] No, leave me alone! Oh, God, not a child. Dorcas! DORCAS GOOD: Leave me! What is she doing here? Get back, witch. 'Tis your own fault. How? How? You sent her to afflict the girls to avenge yourself. They testified to it. They lied. She confessed. And she's got Satan's mark. Show her! Satan sucked blood from me. WOMAN: Poor child. [chatter] 'Tis a flea bite. The child is five years old. She's five years old! Mama. Your prayers curse me. Your prayers curse me. I-- I shall not sign your book. I shall not sign your book. She's been like this for three days. Sign it-- I shall not sign the book. [crying] Ann? No! No, go! Go, go, go! REVEREND PARRIS: Ann! Don't take me. No, no, please. Don't take me for another one. REVEREND PARRIS: Who is it afflicts you? You are not alone. Who is it afflicts you? I shall pray for you. I shall pray for you. The wicked Nurse-- Goody Nurse. Goody Nurse? Goody Nurse. Goody Nurse! I do not want your prayers. Ann, do you know what you are saying? Goody Nurse, I do not want your prayers! Mama-- Goody Nurse! Oh no, no, no, no, no. Dear mama, no. REVEREND PARRIS: Speak its name. Goody Nurse is you. Goody Nurse is you. Oh no. Calm yourself, child. Calm yourself. ANN PUTNAM: Goody Nurse! No! ANN PUTNAM: Goody Nurse! REVEREND PARRIS: Calm yourself, child! Goody, no! [screaming] Mother-- you must get dressed, mother. Oh, Israel, how good of you to visit me. You heard I was feeling poorly. The afflicted have cried out against another. Those poor girls. Mother, they have-- Rebecca, they have cried out against you. [gasp] Harm shall not come to you, Rebecca. We will not let it. [coughing] [music playing] Oh, Lord, have mercy. We are doomed. Dozens of women and men are in a dungeon. Eleven have hanged. They are witches. 'Tis what they deserve. They have afflicted the girls. They've lied! The girls themselves, they should be out to the whipping post. I'll not be intimidated by the slander of them-- not I. The witches must die! They are not witches. Rebecca Nurse is not a witch. How can you doubt that? You know that. Don't you, Goody Walcott? Both of you sit near her in church. Is she not pious? And Goodman Turner, Goody Nurse gave aid to your wife throughout her final days. Is she a witch? No. Then sign this petition. I cannot. We cannot let an innocent woman suffer. Goody Walcott. 'Tis too dangerous. 'Tis not safe. 'Tis too dangerous not to. If Rebecca Nurse can be cried out against, what's to keep you from being next-- any of you? Who will sign it? I shall. My brother's family is too much in the center of this. I do not trust that. Good lad. Father, may I sign it? Well, at least I don't resemble a mirthless old matron. My dear, I'd have stoned the poor artist myself if he had captured any mirthlessness at all. MAN: The others have arrived, Governor. Oh, very well then. It was actually the old Matron [inaudible]. [laughter] Reverend. GOVERNOR PHIPS: Righteous friends, here. Come in. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Make yourselves at home. I trust you had a pleasant journey and no unfortunate mishaps on the way. Gentlemen, make yourselves at home. - Thank you. - Welcome to the city. I have been made aware of some-- do you desire a less rigid chair, Reverend? Or perhaps you'd prefer to stand? Oh, kindly carry on, Governor. We've traveled all day in order to hear your concern. This concerns me. It is a petition signed by, among many others, John Proctor and Israel Porter. Educate me as to this strange ferment of dissatisfaction that is brewing in Salem. We know of this petition. It was-- No, I would have preferred to hear this from Reverend Stoughton. Reverend, how goes it in Salem Village? Well, Israel Porter and John Proctor are the leading members of a group of dissenters, you see, in the village. Dissenters? But I understand these are among the most prominent families in Salem. Yes, but they place their own interests before those of God's community. Modern thinkers, perhaps. Or failed Puritans, perhaps. Then shed your light on the case of Rebecca Nurse. 39 have signed this petition in support of her. She's a woman of impeccable reputation. Yet you have seen fit to examine her for witchcraft and place her in prison. With your permission, Governor, there is much evidence against her. We are all aggrieved by it as well. But a spectre has tormented many innocents. I myself have seen the bruises and the pinpricks on the arms of the children. We see it as a sign of the Devil's advancement in our village. It is a sign that no one is safe. Oh, is it a sign of that? Do you doubt spectral evidence? Of course not. But I must forbid the hanging of any more persons unless there is proof that corroborates the spectral evidence. You must either get a confession or physical evidence as well. Understood? [music playing] Are you afraid of touching a witch? Yes. [music playing] Good morning, Goody Nurse. I must ask you to disrobe. I shall not. You are to be examined for witches teats and Devil's marks. 'Tis not necessary. On my honor, as a Christian, you will find none. Reverend Parris, surely you can stop this humiliation. Tell them how many years I have been a devoted member of the church. You would better your chances, Goodwife Nurse, if you would allow the magistrates to determine the truth for themselves. Pray don't make me disrobe in front of them. Rebecca Nurse, you are on trial for the felony of practicing witchcraft. Would you kindly do as the court requests? The midwives may proceed with the examination. [music playing] Forgive me, Goody Nurse. [music playing] [gasp] There-- 'tis a teat. The Devil suckles there. That is not a witch's mark. It more resembles a mole. No, it is a teat. For the record of the deposition, make note of the divergence of opinion. But also make note of the fact that the witness did not cry, which is compatible with the witch's inability to shed tears. You may examine the pudendum. [music playing] MIDWIFE: Spread your legs. [music playing] Show me tenderness, and I shall find God there. Show me mercy, and I shall find God there. Show me reason, and I shall find God there. Goody Nurse, 'tis not a Puritan prayer. No, it is a prayer of my own. This is blasphemy. God will strike you. No, child. 'Tis people who punish, not God. God is that which finds forgiveness and understanding when others cannot. I can see that now. Show me a bar of good lye soap, and I shall find God there. [laughter] Yes. Even in that small thing, soap, there is God there. God is everywhere. God is all around us. God is within us. God is within us. Show me laughter-- [laughter] --and I shall find God there. [laughter] Show me a jug of rum. [laughter] And I shall find God there. [laughter] Show me a key! [cheering] Yes, a key, and I shall find God there. Yes, show me a chamber pot. [laughter] Oh, find a chamber pot, and I shall find God there. [laughter] Oh, show me hope, and I shall find God there. Mary Lacey, we have brought you here from prison this day in order to help you save your soul. Now tell us about your work with the Devil. Thou has already asked me. Once again, in meticulous detail. He came to me, the Devil, as a blackbird. Did you not say the word was yellow? Oh, yes-- yellow. It was yellow. REVEREND STOUGHTON: Yes. And? And he said he would tear me to pieces if I did not sign his book and serve him. I had no choice. And after, I had the Devil's gift of being able to inflict people. And who else? Who else rides with you? Mary Lacey, give me the names of all the witches and wizards that you know. Don't be afraid. These are our enemies, and they wish us harm. John Proctor. 'Tis John Proctor. He means us harm. GIRLS: John Proctor-- John Proctor-- John Proctor-- John Proctor-- - John Proctor-- - John Proctor-- John Proctor-- Yes, yes. Maybe I have seen Goodman Proctor. GIRLS: John Proctor-- - And he rides with you? He-- he-- he has. He has. GIRLS: John Proctor-- John Proctor-- [interposing voices] [music playing] John Proctor-- John Proctor-- [interposing voices] John Proctor-- I was praying for you. For me? You are in the room with a confessed witch. I was praying that the Devil does not touch you. Thank you. Although the power of your goodness certainly overshadows the feebleness of my prayers. You have faith in me, don't you? As I do in our God. Thank you. Thank you. John Proctor, I have come to arrest you for the crimes of witchcraft. You must present yourself. I shall not. Where is your wife? You are both under arrest. My wife? By the grace of God, she's done nothing. You are under arrest. They shall not accuse her when it is me they wish to hurt. Take me, and leave her be. John! Stay inside, woman. MAN: Mr. Proctor, you are under arrest. Do not touch my wife. Goodman Proctor, what's happening? - She is with child. - Take them both. She is with child. We have legs. We can walk by ourselves. What are you doing? JOHN PROCTOR: [inaudible] - Stay there. JOHN PROCTOR: Get off me. Do not hurt the children! John, they're taking everything. We are confiscating your belongings to pay for your jail term. ELIZABETH PROCTOR: How dare you? Father! The children. Lies-- absurd lies, all of it. Can you not see how they suffer? JOHN PROCTOR: I see their lies! REVEREND STOUGHTON: Your spectre torments you. I shall prove to you that they are not lying. By this test, we shall know the truth. [girls wailing] Annie-- Annie Putnam-- child, rise up. Come along. Meet your tormentor. Come towards him. Touch him. No. No, I cannot. Be not afeard. I cannot. He'll kill me. Annie, ye are in a house of God. - And he shall strangle me. - He shall not. - Yes he shall. - He hall. - He shall not. - He shall. I shall show thee. No! God is with thee, Annie. - No! - Rest assured. No. Witness the power of God almighty. REVEREND STOUGHTON: Annie, Annie-- - No. If indeed you are tormented by his spectre, lay your hand upon him. And that will rid you of his evil. [screaming] Cast your doubt, child. [screaming] God is with thee. [screaming] [silence] [gasping] [chatter] You see? John Proctor, you are guilty of causing great harm. Aye-aye, away with you. This is pure madness. I have harmed no one. Yes, Is and you have committed sundry acts of witchcraft-- No! REVEREND STOUGHTON: --and a body-- No! This man is on trial because of his opposition to that family. [chatter] REVEREND PARRIS: Silence! JOHN PROCTOR: You cannot silence me. You can hang me until I am cold, but you will not silence the truth of my words. You are convicted of witchcraft and condemned to die by hanging from the neck-- No! REVEREND STOUGHTON: --until you are dead. No! [interposing voices] Let us leave. LIZZY PUTNAM: Father! Joseph, no, no, no. JOSEPH PUTNAM: Lizzy, stay here. LIZZY PUTNAM: Joseph! Father, father! [music playing] [interposing voices] WOMAN: Witches! WOMAN: Die, witches. Die. [interposing voices] Die, witches! [interposing voices] Unfit to live! You should die. For Satan-- witch! You are a liar. I am no more a witch than you are a wizard. Is that your confession? If you take my life away, God will give you blood to drink. John Proctor, I will give you one final opportunity to confess your crimes. I shall neither confess an act I have not done nor proclaim my innocence. There's naught you wish to hear from me but the accusations that ring in your own head. I shall admit only that I am not ready to die. Mary, tell Elizabeth this will not take me from her and the children. Tell her to believe that. Goodman Proctor-- We shall pray. Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be fulfilled-- [inaudible] Samuel Parris, only God can give. And only God can take away. Yet upon this hour, I shall end my days because you have taken God's role upon yourself. But do not imagine my last thoughts to be rancorous against you. They're not. I know you'll have your own God to answer to one day. Instead, I shall pray that we who stand before you today-- --lead us not into temptation-- JOHN PROCTOR: --are the last innocent blood to be spilled upon this earth. Hangmen, do not hesitate. He is guilty. Do you not see the evil spectre behind his shoulder whispering in his ear? Do it. Do it. Lead us not into temptation-- REVEREND PARRIS: Rebecca Nurse, you have been excommunicated. Your only chance at salvation is through confession. Until then, there is no God for you to pray to. And therefore you are condemned for eternity in hell. Do you understand? - No, no! She is innocent! This is wrong. No! [crying] You shall not murder my mother. You shall not murder my mother. No! [crying] Save your breath. Rebecca Nurse, you pray for Satan. Let her finish. WOMAN: Yes. Let her finish. ANN PUTNAM: Let her finish. MAN: Yes, let her pray. Please, sir, I beg of you. She cannot be a witch. [praying] She has made no mistake. Just I who made the mistake, sir. 'Tis I who made the mistake, sir. She is innocent, sir. HANGMAN: Ya! [horse neighing] ANN PUTNAM: No! Who will forgive us? Who will forgive us? 'Tis true. 'Tis true. 'Tis true. Oh, hear my remorse, Lord. Hear my remorse. 'Tis a horrible sin. 'Tis true. 'Tis true. - Off, Ann. - 'Tis true. It is true. It is I who should be hanging from that tree. Mama? You're frightening them. They should be frightened. What have we done? An innocent woman died today because of me. And you-- Ann, stop it. A man died because he opposed you. Opposing you is not a crime before God. Do you know what you are saying? This village is being cleansed of your enemies. Israel Porter was right. Ann! - Do you deny it? - Stop it. I will stop it. And if means I hang for it, I will stop this. I shall speak out. You shall speak out? Ann, hear me. If you speak out now, you are not the only one who will hang. [gasping] [moaning] [groaning] Goodwife-- Goodwife Putnam-- Goodwife Putnam, help me! Help me. [heavy breathing] [music playing] Stand. Stand. Good girl. Lizzy? [music playing] Lizzy? [chatter] [baby crying] Will she cry like this for a long time? You should rest now. You can't stay long. I have been mistaken, Good Putnam. It is not possible that this being is of sin. She's perfect. She's not but innocence embodied. She is radiant. I fear-- I fear that Reverend Parris is wrong in what he has done to us. Do not speak such words. Do you believe the Reverend, Goody Putnam, that we are all born guilty? Do not ask me. Do you? Yes, I believe it. Look at her. How could you believe that she is not innocent? Because they grow into us. Goody Putnam, please, I can no longer believe that. Won't you look at her, Goody Putnam? Please. [baby crying] [music playing] Do you not see it? Whatever we grow into, whatever mistakes we make, we still have this inside of us somewhere. And I see that now. [music playing] Child, you've done well. You've done well. [music playing] Thomas! I heard she is here. Is she? Yes. And you have a child, Joseph. Where is she? Joseph, you must beware. Why? What happened to her? Not for Lizzy, for yourself. I fear ye shall be cried out against. Are you threatening me? No. I'm trying to save you. Take them now, and go before your brother returns home. [music playing] [baby crying] You may touch her. [laughter] Both of us. I am taking you home now. Yes-- home. [music playing] [chuckle] [music playing] [baby crying] Move it. Don't you hurt my wife! LIZZY PUTNAM: Joseph! [screaming] JOSEPH PUTNAM: [inaudible] Get in here. LIZZY PUTNAM: Joseph! God, you don't-- don't touch her. Don't-- Lizzy! Lizzy! [crying] [shouting] Lizzy! No! LIZZY PUTNAM: Joseph! Lizzy! REVEREND STOUGHTON: Yes. The girls have identified 60 witches in Andover alone. And in Topsfield, well, the Reverend there has asked for the girls to be sent up as soon as they are able. We are literally surrounded by witches. It's a full-scale war against Puritanism. But it is a war which we are winning. And I think we owe a debt of gratitude to the Reverend Parris here. The work he has done here in Salem Village-- we would not be where we are but for that. [coughing] [baby crying] You must eat something. [inaudible] Come on. [baby crying] [hushing] Elizabeth Putnam. [baby crying] Watch over her for me. Poor child. WOMAN: Lizzy-- A visitor for you. Lizzy, be not afeard. I've come to help you. You could not. I can. Confess. If you do, your life will be spared at least for some time. Confess to what is asked of you. You have faith in my innocence? With all of me. It is why I'm risking all of me to save you. Then what of the others down here with me? What of my husband? My child? Your husband is a warlock. They are witches. LIZZY PUTNAM: No. Your child-- if you-- We are all equally innocent, guilty of nothing more than being human. Where is your God now? Our God, Lizzy. Do not lose faith in that or in me. Your faith, Reverend Parris, seems to much aligned with your self interest. Yet self interest is the very evil you preach against. We are all damned in this place because of you. Yet we were more damned when we sat before you in your meeting house-- Beware of what you are saying. --laying our trust at your feet. I would rather stay down here even if it means my death than be with you and your God up there. [baby crying] [chatter] WOMAN: Gods angels, give us your blessings. [music playing] Forgive me, child. Please forgive me. [music playing] Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Do not take her. Do not take my child. Jesus, do not let him take my children. Do not let him take my children! Is there crisis as it was before? It's worse, I fear. Stop. Stop it. Stop it! Leave my [inaudible]! Go away! Leave me. Leave me. Governor, the afflicted girls of Salem Village have cried out again. We receive this. It should be directed to the Reverend Stoughton. Sir, you should look at it. [music playing] Oh, good God. --noblest of pleasure to be acquainted with thee, [? thy ?] rational, supportive soul. You sweetly [inaudible] when all my powers and passions are united, and engaged, and consumed by grace. [music playing] Whoa. [praying] We are at prayer here. [praying] I believe your work is finished here now, Reverend. [gasping] The work of God is never finished, sir, with your permission. We shall see. [whimper] Know ye this woman beside me. She is my wife, Lady Mary Phips. You have called her a servant of Satan. Which of you called out her name first? Which of you? I know your afflictions. But you go mute and sightless at will. But you shall not be silent now. Which of you first cried out her name? [whimper] 'Twas I who called her name. [gasping] [whispers] GOVERNOR PHIPS: Have you ever laid eyes on my wife before? ANN PUTNAM: No, sir. And now that you regard her, does she resemble a witch? She seems as much a witch as the others were. [chatter] Now, Reverend, tell me, does my wife resemble a witch in your eyes? Perhaps in this case, will have been deluded by Satan. [chatter] Deluded by Satan? And is that how you shall have time to remember this sorry episode? No! I believe you were deluded by your own fears and weaknesses and had the arrogance to call this feeble human delusion God's will. Did you arrogance, sir? Yes, arrogance. May I remind you that this is-- Where was your heart? [music playing] In your search for godliness and faith, did you not even once press yourselves to heed, if not logic, then simple humanity? How could decent men and women follow this shrill, self righteous call of the falsely powerful and become deaf to the simple voices of their own heart? [music playing] How did this happen here? [music playing] How did this happen here? [music playing] [music playing]
