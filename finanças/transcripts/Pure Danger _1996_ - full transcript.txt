All I know is the man works in mysterious ways. A flat tire saved my daddy's life once. What? No lie. The mother got a flat tire, missed the plane trying to leave 'Nam. So? So the jet never made it. One-way ticket to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. That's up. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So we may be a little late delivering the goods, but in all actuality, this flat tire could save our lives. Look, the only thing gonna save our lives right now is you getting your to a phone. Yeah, that's a good idea. OK, I'll be right back. You want something from the liquor store? Just get to the phone! Strawberry soda. Test came up clean. You got a raise this week, too. Yeah. Good! So give me the good news. I'm done, right? I mean, don't leave me hanging. The suspense is killing me. Well... Well? It says here you were late again, Johnie. A couple of minutes! I mean, I had car trouble. Hey, look! You got me stuck way out here in the middle of nowhere, eventually a guy's going to have a little car trouble sometimes. By my count, that's the third time this year. In a year! I'm sorry, Johnie, but until you can demonstrate adequate responsibility as an active member of society, I'm going to extend your parole another six months. Six months? You can't do that! I want to talk to your unit supervisor now! Oh, you didn't hear? He quit. I'm the unit supervisor now. That's really great. Don't do this to me, OK? Please don't do this to me. I'm dying out in that cafe. No one ever goes there. I didn't do this to you, Johnie. You did it to yourself. But I didn't do anything, I told you that! I was set up. All I want to do is go back to Reno and start my life all over again. What can I say, Johnie? Rules are rules. Some rules are meant to be broken. Johnie! Don't do anything you'll regret. You sure you hid that shotgun, right? Shut up, man. I ain't got all day. Who is it? It's Freethrow. Yo, come on in. OK, come on. That's two to you. I raise you three. You raise three? Three. - I'm out. Here, here, go ahead. , go. Happy? What do you got? What do you bet? You bet more? Yeah, I'm betting more! Well, bet more! No, but I got four more on you! I call.. I call. I'm out. What do you got, man? Oh, hold up a second, huh? What? Uh, Freethrow's here to see you. - Freethrow's here? - Yeah. Hey, well, tell Freethrow to wait a minute for me now. I call. - Uh, it'll be a sec. - What do you got? Yeah, cool. Go get me a soda. I call. What do you got? Yeah, you call, Mike. Big Mike. Read 'em and weep, baby! You're going up the river. I've got a full boat, my friend! Wait a minute, man. I'm in this game. I got a royal flush. Push the bottle over here. You don't have to get mad about it, baby. Yeah, all right. What can I do for you, Freethrow? The diamonds. Do you mean those diamonds you were supposed to have here last night to sell me? Those diamonds, that what you talking about? Hey, Miccelli, how long does it take to get to LA? Four or five hours? That's about right. That's about right, huh? Yes, sir, man, traffic must have been one kicking, screaming, two-timing mother!! That's right! Get your black six hours late, come see your white ,, do business. Let's go do this business. Why didn't nobody tell me we was going to do this, huh? Nobody tells me nothing. I'm out of the loop, man! I can see that. Nice! What's this? That $700,000, minus $699,999 in late fees. What's this, a joke? You kidding me? What's the problem? So you gonna start a war with Apollo? Huh? Rethink this. Go have a sandwich, go take a shower. Rework it in your head. I don't wait for anybody. If you don't give me that money, we got a problem! Hey, man, we got a problem now! Get that out of my face! Get down! I need your car! Get out of the car! don't shoot me! Just take the car! Just give me my! Come on! Come on, you're moving like snails! Come on! Let's go! Go, go, go! Watch your back! Watch your back! Easy! Hey, wake up! Wake up! What is it, nap time? Forget your No-Doze? What are you doing with your freaking head out the window? What are you, a dog? Find him! Find him now! Watch your left! What are you doing? get in here! punch your horn out! Son of a-- Wake up, fat head! We're going 2,000 miles an hour here and this guy's in a coma! Oh! I don't see him, boss. I don't know where he went. Lost! I'm the one and only ugh! Break you down-own-own! Save me now! Please, Johnie, stop singing! What's the matter, baby, you don't like my song? No, the song I like. The singer's questionable at best. Ha! Baby, this here's a rock-and-roll omelet. Mashed potatoes and mushrooms, little tiny bit of cilantro, little tiny bit of chili pepper. That's nice, but we haven't had a customer for hours. Yeah, tell me about it. If I don't cook around this joint, I get a little rusty, huh? We got a customer! Probably that perverted sheriff again feeling lonely. Hope not. You got a phone, sugar? Thanks. Johnie! I'm at the spot. Where the is Felix? He's on his way. What went down? Man, they us on the deal. What? You get my money? Nah. I got the stones. Well, you just hang. Felix is on his way. Yeah, I hope he gets here quick! Johnie! Could I get a cup of java? Excuse me? Some coffee. Coffee, java. Thanks. Could you sit down for a second? What's your name? Becky. Becky. That's a beautiful name, Becky. So you work here alone? About a year. You got family around here? Got a brother. I got a kid named Hank. He's 10 years old, you know. His mom died last year. I've been raising him. I'm sorry. We were perfect together. She thought I was a construction foreman. I lied to her for 15 years. When she died, she still thought I was in construction while my kid lives with his mom's sister. He thinks I'm in construction. They all think I'm construction. So you aren't in construction? What I'm trying to tell you, Becky, what I'm trying to confess is love means trust. If you don't got trust, you don't got love, right? I thought I had love. I didn't. My wife had love because she had trust. My kid and sister-in-law, they all got love. Right now, in this moment, I got love. I don't follow you. I love you. I love you because I trust you. I trust that when a man named Felix walks in that door, you're going to give him this satchel. OK. Where are you going? I'm leaving, you know, but it's important anybody else comes through that door, you don't-- you don't tell about me, or the satchel. All right? Mister? Hey, mister? Oh, God, Johnie! Johnie, help me! Johnie, it's not the sheriff. Huh? It's not the sheriff! Well, good, maybe that son of a bitch will pay then. Johnie, it's some guy who looks like-- he looks like a dead guy! I can't believe I'm trying to cook here and-- I'm serious! Come with me, please, come on and help me! Damn! I thought you was kidding! No! Wonder what's in the bag. I don't know. He told me to give it to some guy named Fred. It's kind of heavy. Try that road there! Becky, we're in a world of hurt! What are you talking about? These are hot diamonds! They're stolen? I mean, this guy's probably a gangster or something! And who knows who he called on the phone? They're probably on their way here right now! Who shot this guy? I mean, the cops are gonna think that I did it! - Why would they think that? - I've got a record! Oh, God, Johnie, you're scaring me! Watch the turn! Geez! You're driving like Starsky and Hutch or something! We got a customer! What's wrong? I'm like a clown in the circus. I think that bandage is too tight, it's impairing your vision! All right? OK, there's-- there's his car, so we know he's here. All right? Let's just be cool, OK? Just cool. What, am I keeping you up? We've got to get rid of the body! Come on! - I ain't touching no dead body! Behind the bar! Behind the bar! Uh! Hurry! Mike, you cool? Are you cool? You cool? All right, I'm cool. Let's go, let's do it, huh? How you doing? Yeah, three coffees and some apple pie. It's peach. What? We have peach pie. We don't have apple pie. Uh, I'm going to get that coffee ready. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Let me ask you something. Do I look like the kind of guy who cares what kind of freaking fruit is in the pie? Yeah! Listen, you see some guy around here? Tall guy, dark clothes. Black. Black? Wha-wha-what? What, do I have a speech impediment? Yeah, black! You know what that is, don't you, sweetheart? You see him? Nope. You're our only customers all afternoon. Is that so? Is that so? I think you're lying! Why do you think that? What, are you stupid? You think I'm stupid? You're saying I'm stupid, is that what you're saying? His car's out there! Don't say I'm stupid because I'll get angry, I'll get violent! OK? Look at them. You want me to get violent? I don't want to hurt you. I'll hurt you! Ah, come to think of it, a guy did drop by here to use the phone real quick, but he split. Shut up! But he split. Shut, shut, shut, shut! He's here, I can smell him! Now, you're not telling me everything I want to know, are you? Hmm? Now I have to repeat myself. And I hate, hate repetition! I said, is that tall guy here? Good afternoon, sweetheart. My name's Felix. Hi, Felix. A friend of mine asked me to meet him here. Oh yeah? What friend is that? Hey, I'm talking to you, Magilla! I believe you made a racial slur. Yeah, that's right. This friend wouldn't be that punk, Freethrow, now would it? I don't believe we've been acquainted. Oh, well, let me introduce myself! Hey, hey, it's only my card! Run! - The diamonds! - They got the diamonds! The diamonds! Nice to meet you. That was fun. Let's do a little espresso next time, all right? $600 suit! What are you looking at, turd brain? Get the car, meet me in the back! Ah, Jesus! Come on! Come on! Get over here, come on! Ah! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Excuse me, Becky, I'm trying to concentrate here, OK? It's not the right thing to do, Johnie! What do you mean, it's not the right thing to do? They're gonna kill us no matter what we do! You don't know that! Hello! That guy that died back there in the cafe all by himself? I don't think we asked him to do that. OK, get me them diamonds. I gotta get them diamonds! Speed up, speed up! I see 'em, Johnie! We gotta lose 'em. Hold on! Huh? There! Here we go. I can't work with you guys anymore. Look at you! Come on! You've done this before, haven't you? Once or twice. Come on, now! Come on, sit up straight! Sorry, boss, I'm trying. Gah! Just hold on a second. We've gotta go to the police, don't you think? No, I don't think. What, do you want to be flipping burgers the rest of your life? I didn't think so! This is our chance for freedom, baby! We could go anywhere. We could go to Los Angeles! I got a friend there. Maybe he could help us move the ice. Ice? The rocks! The goods! The diamonds! Oh, oh God! Oh no. Oh, this sounds like we're in big, big trouble! Big trouble! Hey, this ain't Bullocks, right, ya yuppie! Come on, he's jinxing me, you know that? Shut up! I'm going to win, baby! Yeah, get outta here! Go to a park and swing on a swing or something, right? She should be wearing a little girly-- Mr. Farmentero, how youse doing? Know who this is? Not so lucky today, are we, Dice? I'm hanging in there. I wanna show you something. Pay particular attention to this. Pay particular attention right here in the debit column. What's it say? We gotta do this right now? Can we do this later? What's it say? 250,000. 485. Say it! 485. Now what are you going to do about it? Yeah, all right, all right, yeah. You're right, I mean, I owe you a load of money. I know that! But it's right around the corner, you know what I mean? I owe you a pile of money, but all I need is a couple of days, you know what I mean? Two days, it's coming around! You know what I'm doing? I'm in the process of liquidating the whole club. The whole club is liquidating into a successful operation. I got a lot of beautiful women, you know, you know, and you can have it, all of it! Do whatever you want with it! I checked out your bank account. You got no collateral, no assets. Nobody's stupid enough to give you any money. You in a hell of a lot of trouble, pal. But I'm a generous man. 48 hours, you have the money, all of it in my office and in my possession, or else I'll cut down on my overhead. Finger by finger, capisce? That's good. That's real good. What are you looking at? What are you looking at? What are you staring at, huh? It's called right? This is real, so why don't you deal a real card for the time in your life? Nobody talks to me that way! We got men on every exit out of town. Come on, Ray, he's already on his way back to that Apollo. Now look, get everybody on it. You call our boys out there in LA and you tell them, ice this before he gets back here or we've got a war. I said nobody talks to me that way! Nobody! The best round so far, round four is look-- You're doing great, boss! Great! OK, here's the deal. It's really not that bad in here. I mean, it's just a little eccentric, but it's tastefully done. Johnie, you told me it was a cafe. I can't believe this! Cafe, strip bar, what's the difference? Well, look, I ain't seen the guy in five years. I didn't know. You think I like this? Do you think I want to see naked women dancing in the-- You see what I'm saying? Classy, huh? Hey, Slick! Where's Dice? Through the hall and down the door. Um, could you just wait here for a second? Yeah. I'll just be a second. Come on, baby, give me some flesh! Did I catch you at a bad time? Don't you knock? Barge into my office. Get outta here! Get outta here! It's Johnie! Crazy Johnie! Hey, hey! Some things never change. Johnie boy! Two years I spent in the pen because of you! Two years, Johnie, two years! Yeah, all right, Maybe I did. I sent you something, right? You sent me a year's subscription of the "Hustler," you turd. Yeah, two of them. Three of them. I ought to kill you right now! You want a cigarette? All right, I'm sorry, all right? You're sorry? I didn't belong there in the first place! I should kill you! What was I supposed to do, go waltzing into jail, like Say hi, is Johnie there? Excuse me, the cops are after me. I up, you know, I made a mistake. All right? I don't know, baby, I made a mistake. Johnie, you OK? Who's that? That's Becky. Prettier than a magazine, man! I got something to show you. Come on, man. Uh-oh! Holy! My mother! Where'd you get these? That's not important. The point is I want to get rid of them. Well, you've got to tell me where you got them. We got them from a dead gangster Becky poisoned with a cup of coffee. I didn't poison him! He got shot. Don't go telling people I poisoned a gangster. Come on, Johnie! Whoa, forget about it. There's some things I don't got to know, you know I mean? But I don't understand. I don't see you for three years, you come waltzing in my club like-- like-- like Venus fully fledged from the sea? What do you want from me? I can't buy them. That much I figured. All we need from you is to have you introduce us to one of your rich, low-life, scumbag friends that are looking to make a quick buck. Oh, why didn't you say so? Excuse me, Tick and Tack? I got a little business here. You know what? Why don't you teach him how to drink some milk, all right? I got business. Yeah, let's go get some milk. Yeah, help him with that, will ya? Mr. Farmentero! Mr. Farmentero, it's me! What do you want, you maggot? I got something for you. You got my money? No, no, no, no. Better! What's this? You're not going to believe this. Get the off! Get the off! These real? Yeah, they're real! What am I going to do, give you fake diamonds? Where the did you get these? Craziest thing. I'm driving up the West Side, right? And I'm going to shake down this bum, you know? He owes me money. You know? What am I trying to do? Right, what am I trying to do? Pay my debts, right? Huh? So anyway, I'm driving and this gorgeous chick is on the side of the road. Gorgeous blonde, UCLA chick, right? College material. Little knapsack, you know? So I'm a gentleman, right? So I pull over. It's me, you know? So she gets in going I'm not an idiot, I'm speed, baby! And I pull over. So anyway, bing bang boom, ba de ba da, ga doosh! We're done! I pull away. I'm getting rid of her. I drop her off. Innocent little thing. Next thing I know, I'm driving away when what do I see? Her purse. Yeah, her purse is on my car seat, and so I say, I'd better be the gentleman. You know, I do the right thing. I bring it right back. I pick up the purse on the way, these little rocks fall out. These little diamonds are yelling at me, you know what I mean? You know, I look in the purse. I'm a sneaky ,, and there's 50 of 'em, maybe a hundred of 'em. You know what I mean, a lot of them. So the way I look at it, it's finder's keepers, you know? You play, you pay. You slow, you blow. You know what I mean? So that's it. That's why I'm here, baby. That's so a major story. Get outta my way. So what's the chick's name? What? She must have gave you a name, no? Yeah, she said her name was Ass-shley! So I'm thinking, you know, maybe you could fence them for me, you know what I mean? You know, skim a little off the top for me, a little on the side. My lease is up in October. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll see what I can do. I'll think about it. I'll give you a call. I'll keep the sample. Yeah, yeah, all right, whatever you want. I'll be waiting by the phone. I'll call ya! I'm waiting by the phone! I said I'd call ya! What? Yeah, it's Farmentero. So? Get DePalma, tell him I got good news. Hang on. This you, fatboy? Yeah, Mr. DePalma. I found something you've been looking for. You talking about my ice? - Yeah. - Good. You know what to do with it? Yeah, I'll set it up. Right. The regular commission? Yeah,. Thank you, Mr. DePalma. Yeah? Yeah, it's Farmentero. Yo. Tell my pal I found something it belongs to, and I'm looking to make a deal. All right, set it up. Right. Come on, call, baby, call! Come on! That's him! All right, all right, how do you open the flipping thing? Get it! You don't know how to work your phone? It's your phone! I ain't got no friends, nobody calls me. Give me that thing here. Yeah! No, no, this is Johnie. Hold on one second. It's for you. Who'd you expect it to be for, Elvis doing pirouettes with Newt Gingrich? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got Dice. Oh, Mr. Farmentero! Oh, great! Great, oh great! No problem. Midnight. All right, well, Mr. Farmentero, I just want to tell you how thankful I am that you-- hello? Hello? What happened? He hung up on you? Yeah, yeah, but he says he's going to meet us at the junkyard at midnight, and he's going to buy the diamonds! He's gonna buy the diamonds? Johnie, we're gonna be rich! Look at youse, the king and queen of High Rose. I love you, Johnie. This is it, this is fricking destiny, baby! There once was a man walking down the sidewalk. He stepped on a big, black bug and didn't think twice about it. That bug went to heaven, and when he came back to Earth, he came back a lion. The lion, he found that man and tore him limb from limb. I want you to find them, get my diamonds, and tear them all limb from limb. OK. Something I learned from Squiggy Markowitz in the joint. Take the lighter, right? Tape it to the gas can. Give me a little tape. Then we take that wire that we hooked to the flint, and we get it running. Stick it to the trunk like this. All right. Now when the guy opens the trunk, it triggers the flint. Boom! Fourth of July! So how's this gonna work, boss? Both these guys hate each other, right? I don't have an opinion.. That's a good question. Tick, you take the left. Tock, you take the right. I'm Tock! Just do what I tell ya! Right here, right here, right here! What's the matter, Dice? Everything OK? - Yeah, yeah, I'm cool. I'm cool. What do you think, I'm not cool? I'm born for this! Oh my God, they look like thugs! Who'd you expect? All right, listen. You gonna tell me where the diamonds are? They're in the trunk. All right, in the trunk. All right, good. Good. Stay here. Let me out! Don't move, don't move. Mr. Farmentero, how you doing? You look like a million bucks! Stop playing with yourselves. You bring the ice? I'm your man. You bring the cash? Only if you brought the ice. Now how would you know? How would you know if I didn't bring the ice? You'd still have to bring the cash either way! So would you, puke face! Yeah, but I thought of it. I said it first. It came out of my mouth first. Who gives a! You got it or not? Yeah, I got it. I got it. Listen, I was wondering. You know, maybe if you gave it some thought as to what my cut's going to be? What do you think they're saying? I don't know, I'm scared. And I've got a feeling you're in a beautiful mood tonight, and you're going to be real sweet and generous to little Dice, huh? I'm in a real mood, and you're lucky to still be alive. Yeah, no problem. I mean, I could just take this someplace else, you know? I was just thinking of you. Excuse me for wanting to keep it in the family! Huh? - Come on, Dice! Relax, relax, here comes the man now. DePalma? What's he doing here? There's a lot of guys coming. Oh God, Johnie! This the punk? He's one of them. The other two are in the car. How are you doing, sir? Shut up. I brought him here, now what about us? What, you proposing to me, Farmentero? How about showing some respect, huh? You got to earn that respect. Really? Consider that part of your dues. So, it looks like you two guys are working for me now, huh? Mr. DePalma. Mr. DePalma, Mr. DePalma, Dice Malone! You don't know me, but I know you. You know what I mean? I keep my eye on you. Top dog, eye on the sparrow. Golden bird, baby, golden bird! Listen, listen, that guy, I mean, I never even liked him! You know what I mean? He had it coming to him! You don't do that. He's fried fish, dead in the water, belly up, belly up! Let him float! You know what I mean? Listen, you know the thing about the diamonds? Funny thing, you know? They fell in my lap. Fall right in. Things like that happen, you know? Listen, listen! I'll tell you what. You want them? I don't even know where I got them, I don't ask nothing. You want 'em, they're yours! Why don't we exchange 'em? We'll exchange-- Shut up! Uh-huh, uh-huh! Look, I didn't know you were involved, that's what I'm saying. You know, if I knew you were involved, I never would have-- Shut up! Look, I didn't know you were involved. I swear I didn't! You think-- - I said shut up! - I'm cool. No problem. Look, there's only one way you're going to walk out of this alive, punk. I'm way ahead of you! You set me up. Look, just do what he says, Johnie. All right? You know who this man is? I'll do whatever you want, all right? Just don't hurt him, OK? I'll do whatever you want. I'm only going to ask you once. Uh, yeah, they're in the trunk. I swear, they're in the trunk. Keys! Keys! I can't open the trunk without the keys! Give him the keys, man! Give him the keys, Johnie! OK, Johnie. Johnie B. Goode! Come on, hand them over! Which one? It's the little one. The little one. The little-- what little one? Here, take my gun for chrissake. God! Hey, do something, will you? DePalma! I'm doing business here, and I'll deal with you later! This is my town, you can deal with me now. Hey, hey, hey, no, I don't take orders from nobody, especially you. I understand, due to your flagrant ignorance, you expect my reaction to be one of anger. You want feelings hurt so that maybe I become irrational to the point that I make a mistake. Well, you know we can resolve this issue. You just follow my instructions very carefully. Suck on this! Tick, cover me, you moron! I'm dead! Got it! Just a minute. I'll take those. Um, save my ass! Oh my God! Come on, buddy. Get in the car! Quick! I had to do one good thing before I go. Just shut up! Get in! Get down, get down on the floor! Oh my God! Go, Johnie! This is all your fault, Dice! I-- I had to do something right once, Johnie, right? Well, what'd you jump in front of that bullet for? Now hold on, I'm gonna get us out of this. Johnie, man, you better watch your turns! I gotta lose 'em or we gotta hide for a while. Where can we go? Five-five-five.. Huh? Five-five-five! Five-five-five! Come on, this ain't bumper cars, Johnie! Will you shut up for a second? I'm trying to think! It's getting a little warm in here! Slow down! What are you doing? You wanna kill somebody? Take it easy! Just hold on! I got a little trick up my sleeve. I'm gonna get out of here. He's mine. They're gonna kill us! Why are they going to kill us! Stay down! Stay down! All right, we lost 'em. You're crazy, Johnie! I got to get to Stella! I gotta see my queen. I gotta see my baby. Oh my God! It's the Lion King! King of the lions, right, Johnie? What happened to you? Nothing happened! Oh my God! Stella, Stella! You're bleeding! Stella! Get outta here! I wanna be with my queen bee! I'm always gonna love you! I love you, too. I love you, too. Dice? Dice? Dice? This is what he died for? Are they real? Oh, yeah. Uh, listen, Becky and I are in a little bit of trouble here, OK? We need to stash these rocks and get the hell out of dodge for a while. Where you going to go? We haven't figured that out yet. Well, I mean, that's not so important right now. The important thing is that we find a safe hiding place for these things. OK, because if these guys find this on us, we're going to get killed for sure. But if they're hidden, we can use this for a hell of a bargaining chip. Johnie, maybe we should bury them. I mean like a safety deposit box, something like that. I know where you can hide them. As much as I cared for him, he was still a.. Now he's a million dollar.. I can't believe this. Honey, come on, he's dead. All right? I mean, you've got to admit, they're never going to look there! We should go. Listen, I'll call you later, OK? Good work! Becky? Beck, wait a second! We're wasting our time here! You think those diamonds are here? They're probably laying miles away on some island. Drinking pina coladas! That's where we should be right now, some island somewhere drinking pina coladas! Johnie, I'm really scared. I don't wanna die! How'd we ever get here? What are we doing? I don't know exactly what we're doing, but we ain't going to die! All right? All right. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I think I'm falling in love with you. What did you say? I said, I think we're in trouble! Come on! They got by us. They're getting away! All right, sweetheart, just like in life, you've got one shot at this! You still got those rocks? Where they stashed? Go to hell! Yeah, I'm on my way. All right, Joey. I want you to rape this place, make sure that ice isn't still here. I don't know where home is anymore, Johnie. Shiny We're like ghosts! We're like dead people walking around. Now we're going to a morgue. You think we're going to die? No. I know you got angels watching us. That I do know. I just want to be with you, Johnie. I want to run away with you. I want to start over, just you and me. Johnie, why'd you go to prison? Why'd I go to prison? That's one of them things I don't like to talk too much about. But I'll tell you. When I was a kid, I used to run numbers for this guy named Big Louie. The small stuff, me and Dice. Racketeering. It kind of parlayed into a swiping cars and dope and just got out of hand. You know, some stupid things went down. I was young, I needed the money. At least I thought I did. One night I get this call from Dice. He says, uh, says he wants me to drop off this car. If I don't ask any questions, I make five grand. So like an idiot, I do it. I make the delivery. I go to walk away, and I get popped by four narcs. They take me downtown, smack me around a little bit, try to scare me. They give me a couple of options. Rat your friends out, walk away from this, or do two years. And these are guys I grew up with. I love these guys. I did the time. Stupid, right? No. No. It's not stupid at all. It's not stupid. They called the morgue! Don't shoot! - Just give him a twenty. - Here you go. Thank you. Keep the change, huh? Gotta love these old ones. Just a sec. A little something I learned in high school! I wanna ask you a question. Do I, do I threaten you? Huh? Please stop! I mean, does my presence give you pause? I don't know anything! I mean, I'd be so scared of this big wop with an attitude. I'd do anything to avoid the pain. What pain? Did you know that the third worst place to get shot is in the shoulder? Well, you know that now, don't you? You know where the second worst place? That's the kneecap. Please, no more! Where are the diamonds? Where are the diamonds? I told you! I'm not lying! They're in Dice's body! You'd better not be. Why would I lie? Problem? Yeah. They stashed the ice in the little body. I don't care. Now you get to the morgue before they do, and you tell DePalma ciao. You know the absolute worst place to get shot is? I told you what you want. What? I'm busy! Yes, I'm sure! I'm busy! I know it said all-you-can-eat chicken, Beth. I'm not an idiot. But I'm telling you, they got lobster too. I was there last night. Yeah. There'll be a stampede. Yeah! Excuse me. Um, we're looking for somebody. Actually, a body. Just fill out a form. Hello? Yeah. No! Oh, man, if I don't get laid soon, man, I'm going to join a nunnery. I'm not kidding. Some of the guys around here are starting to look good. Yeah. Excuse me, miss! Excuse me, miss, my brother was killed, and the police have asked us to come down to the morgue to identify the body. And you're being extremely rude! And we're trying to find my brother. Can you please help us? This is an emergency room. If he's dead, I think it can wait. If it can't wait, you can go to the morgue downstairs, OK? And find it yourself. That was really good! It was? You wouldn't believe what just was at the desk. Bimbo! Johnie, I don't like this. How do you think they feel? Ugh! Let's get out of here! No, no, no, he's probably right over here somewhere! It's just a matter of finding him. last time, DePalma! Get down! Johnie! Just get on, get on! Shh! Hurry up! Don't move! This place is making me sick. Can we toast the bodies so I can get back? I got a few more things to do for DePalma. No problem. He's right over there. No, no, not that one, this one! Well, looks like the little booger's smiling! Tell me something, lad. What does burning flesh smell like? Kind of like chicken. Oh, good Lord, no. I had chicken for lunch! You're too much, Mitch! OK, the coast is clear! Oh, God! Oh, God! Let's go. Hi, yeah, page 85. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Remember when she did that?? I'm looking for two young people. Uh, just fill out a form and sit over there, and someone will be with you in a minute, OK? No, you don't understand. Look, I don't have time to understand, OK? If you need assistance, fill out a form. Excuse me. I'm looking for two people. Um, Beth, I'll call you right back. A man, brown hair, mustache. A woman, blonde. Yeah. Good. Where'd they go? They went to the mor-- They went to the morgue. Go down there, take a right. No, I mean a left-- A left. And then another right, and then go down three stairs and and take your first left. And there will be a sign. Thanks. It's nice talking to you. You know, Mitch, I can handle this. You don't have to stay. Nah, I got to make sure it's done. Suit yourself. Look! OK, You stay here. Where are you going? I'm going to go take a closer look. You know, this is like the fifteenth one of these I've done already. I ain't even had lunch! Yeah, another question. What the hell do you do with the ashes? Usually we put them all together, we scoop an urn right through 'em, and we give 'em to the families, like, here you go, here's your uncle Freddy! But with the John Does like your friend-- Turn it off! Let's get out of here! Give me the ice, or this cute little girl here meets her maker. Just let her go, man. I'm not playing with you! I don't got it! Oh! Oh! It's just a scratch. They'll probably make it. You may not be so lucky! The next one is going to take her pretty little face off. They're in the body. What? The body they cremated. Oh my God! Where are the ashes? They get sucked up by these pipes and sent down to the waste disposal unit, and a truck loads them up and hauls them away. Where's that? Behind the administration building in the back. Thank you. You'd better be telling me the truth, because I'm sick of this. She's my little insurance policy. Johnie! Becky! Hello? Killjoy! Oh, hi, Mr. DePalma! Where's that morgue truck going? It's going to Portland Avenue. Portland? Portland and what? Uh, Portland and Grand. Portland and Grand? OK. Portland and Grand. Put Mitch on the phone. I don't think he can talk right now. Look out! Come on! Catch that truck! Let me out of here! Shut up! Rocking! How I look? You look good, boss. Get around him, get around him! Boyfriend thinks he's some kind of superhero, huh? That's because he is! He's gonna be a dead hero! I get it. Wait, damn it! Hang on, boss! Get me that truck! What is wrong with you? We gotta to that truck. We gotta get to that truck now! Portland and Grand! Left turn! Get this! Take care of this flea man. Make him disappear! You got it,. Get rid of him! Bye! Hold my hand! You wanna race me? Yeah, come on! Oh, now he wants to race. What is this? We're gaining on him. I got him! What is wrong with you? Huh? Huh! Go get him,! Come on, get this guy! Help me! Shut up! Shut up! Help! Jesus! Oh, yeah! Woo! Kill! Don't get us hit by this car, all right? I'll get him! Don't let him-- Chitty chitty bang bang! What's that? Oh, no! Hold on! Becky! Beck! I got you. Come on! Let's get out of here! We're gonna make it, baby. We're going to make it! I'm gonna get us to a doctor. He's gonna patch us both up real good. You swear? I swear. I swear, honey. Just hang in there. Cross your heart and hope to die? Don't say that. Don't say that, angel. Hey! Hey, don't go to sleep on me, huh! Wake up! Becky! Wake up! I'm going to sing something to you, OK? Hey! Jesus! Come here! Here! Here, I'll put in the tape, all right? Hey, hey, suckers, it's Dice! Well, if you're listening to this, I'm probably on a beach somewhere, soaking up the rays, kicking back, drinking margaritas. Or something got with the deal, and I'm dead. Dead in the water. The diamonds! Remember the diamonds? Beck? They're under the spare tire in the trunk. Sweetheart, did you hear that? You'll never guess where I switched them. Never! - You hear that! You know what, I think I'll leave that to your imaginations. - Hold on! Hold on one second! Anyway, baby faces, hasta la vista, Johnie! Wherever I am. We did it, angel! We fooled them all, baby! Look, look, we got the rocks! We got 'em, baby. Everything's going to be OK. I just got to get us to a doctor now. I got to get a drink of water. I don't think I can make it much further. Here's a little cafe up here, all right? I'll get us something. I'm not feeling so good. I'll call you an ambulance, baby. I don't think I can make it much further. I'll call you an ambulance. I'm at a Cadillac Jacks on Highway 14. You know where that is. Just send a car. Just send some help out here. You know where to find us. Hello? Hello, sir? Hello? Hello? And I spent all my time in a cowboy bar. My folks gave me a car,.. And now I spend all my time out on the road. But if I had the money that I'd do instead of this. Can we get some water over here? Jack, there's a dead guy out there and he just asked for a glass of water. Dead guy! What the hell is this, the Last Supper? Are you OK, mister? Yeah. Thank you. What's your name? Cindy. Want to sit down or something? Uh, no, I don't think so. You ever been in love before? I think so. It's like paradise, ain't it? I mean, it's the way it makes you feel. I never felt nothing like it. Mister? Hey, hey, mister! Jack! Jack! He's there. Damn! Should we call the police? What's in the box? I don't know. Oh my God! Jack! Close that! What? We gotta, uh-- This? Yeah, let's-- Come on! Let's go! Hurry, hurry,! Do you think we should be doing this? Oh, man, what, do you want to be flipping burgers the rest of your life? Hello, who are you? Have you been all right? Do you miss me when I used to call your name in vain? Well, baby, tell me who are you? OK, so I didn't know his teacher fairly. No way I could have brought you to all those fancy parties. I'm sorry, I tried. Bye, bye, crazy blue eyes! I think I made a big mistake. Typical me. Somebody put me in my place. Now I'm free to do the things I could not do before. Bye, bye. Love has played a trick on me. The man above is throwing sticks at me, and will I throw them back? Yeah, and be who I deserve to be. I cried. Bye, bye, crazy blue eyes! Bye, bye, crazy blue eyes! Come on! It's easy when she holds my hand and takes me, but I don't know where you're going, baby. Don't go without me. I would not go without you. I would not. I would not. Bye, bye, love. Well, do you like it when I hold your hand? Do you like it when I touch you there? Bye, bye, love. Bye, bye. Bye, bye, crazy blue eyes! Bye, bye, crazy blue eyes.
