Nara, stop it! But I'm not doing anything wrong! Nara is just terrible. Always answering back. Lunch is served. Shall we? C'mon guys' Come, Rosa! Nara, don't spill it. - Fine! - Hey, don't do that! Cacau, grab a chair! I need help in the kitchen. Smells delicious! Alessandra, can you lend a hand in there? Make some room. Let's eat. After 20 years, I decided to make this fish stew to honor Dado. Our guardian of the Amazon. Thank you very much. You have no idea how badly I ate during my trip. So this stew here is a godsend. - Can we eat it too? - Of course you can. Only you to inspire me to dig up this recipe from my married days. I want to be honored too, dearest mother-in-law. As soon as you stop threatening to divorce my son, I'll make you a beautiful homage. And surviving marriage is not reason enough for an homage? Especially with your son? I was reading an article in a magazine about a tribe where women make a stew out of their husbands. A feast. But only lots of pepper would make it taste good. - It's true. - Where did you read that, Rosa? In one of my magazines, right? Probably. Probably. 1 don't think you understood what the article said. What didn't I understand? Do you want to know? What you didn't get is that women didn't kill their husbands to make a stew. The article was about a symbolic ritual of their mythology... It's impossible to eat like that. - Come here, my love. - Go with grandma, go. - Why don't you go play now? - OK. This article also mentions how the adults from the tribe care for their children in their day-to-day. You could learn a thing or two from this tribe. Day-to-day stuff. I can't believe you're asking your husband to stop what he's doing to bathe your daughters. Are you comparing the preservation of the Yanomami tribe, of the Amazon rainforest, standing up to powerful mining companies, to writing texts for a bathroom website with the incredible goal of forcing people to hit "like"? Would you prefer your husband to stay home bathing your daughters? A man whose work has such an environmental impact? How selfish of you, Rosa. Wake up. Do you know "Furo do Maracuj√©"? It's an amazing riverside tribe with some wonderful stories. My website... Actually, I don't have a website, I work for many different clients, but I'm currently working on a website for a cutting-edge steel company, did you know that? And 1 think you could renovate your bathrooms, your taps look horrible. I know a lot about taps, you know. Darling, that's not even the point. The point is Dado's work is important. And this time it was amazing, because we had close contact with the daily habits of the families. A unique experience. Yeah, because you really learn a bit more about... Other people's families. Rosa! Dammit! Let's get inside. Come Juju, Nara. We have to take things inside. - HI take this. - C'mon. Did we get everything? Dado, it's not funny, they're going to get a cold. HI have to take care of them later, not you. Everybody get inside! I'm going to count to three. One! Two! Three! I bring you lollipops. This lollipop is for you and this one is for you. You know, it's funny how you never do the dishes at home but when there's an audience... Actually, that's not the problem. Every time we come here you get like that. That means the problem is not me. You're the problem, Rosa. Yeah, right. As soon as daddy finishes doing the dishes, we're leaving. So get your things. Oh no, mom! I don't want to go home, I want to stay at grandma's. - Yeah, mom. - I'm not asking for your opinion, - I'm simply letting you know. - Let them stay a little longer. Can I enjoy my Sunday too? Plus they're wet from the rain... - You're tough on them. - I wonder why? I must have some kind of memory of someone being really tough on me. It certainly wasn't my dad, that sweetheart. Are you talking about Homero? What an image you have of your father? Our memory cheats... Homero has always been an absent father, -never helped me with anything. - Mom, let me tell you something. If my father left you, I have nothing to do with that. No, your father didn't leave me. I put a stop to that leech who lived at my expense. Can I tell you something? You're wasting your time. You're not going to change how I see my father. You were conceived in my trip to Cuba and Homero wasn't there. At the Sociology and Education Conference. You're drunk, right? You must be crazy. I had an affair. A quick one. In Havana, during the conference. It was there. Homero has no idea. Doesn't even suspect it. He was a Brazilian sociologist, an education activist like myself. But I haven't heard from him, I don't have his number or address. And you hid this from us all this time? You never said a word, mom. You are Homero's son. Your call has been forwarded to voicemail please, leave a message after the tone. SINCE YOU CHOSE ANOTHER DAD FOR ME, I CHOOSE NOT TO BE YOUR DAUGHTER ANYMORE. STOP CALLING! Tug of war. Hi, Alessandra. Is Cacau there? He vanished, you know him. Make yourself at home. Hey, daddy! I'm going to show you where my daddy is. Come, I'll help you. - Where's he? - Here he is. Go with mommy, it smells like cigarette in here. Cigarette. Cigarette, cigarette. Mrs. Clarice, huh? Fuck, Cacau. She outdid herself at lunch. The worst part is that things make sense now. She's always liked you better. She's always protected you, everything you did was wonderful and she was always chewing me out. I thought maybe it was because I'm a woman, but no. Fuck. You have like five childhood photo albums, and I have just a horrible one that I finished myself. Shit. Thirty eight years keeping this information to tell me the way she did? Knowing I have a different father is not even the worst part, the way she said it is. So cold, what the fuck? No, no. My dad is Homero. He'll always be. The guy who used to enter apnea contests with us. Those puppet shows in a fucking suitcase. You're still my sister, OK? 100%. Not half-sister. 100% my sister. It'll have to be a grand party. I'll arrive in a balloon. - ...like a fairy. - Girl, I'm impressed! I'm so excited! Why can't we come in? I don't get it. I'm going to tell you, it's better out here. We are out here, dad. Is it that bad? You and Didi can't talk to each other, is that it? What can I do? I'm here now, but I've got to go to a hotel, darling. And you're going to a hotel today? If possible, I'd like to go to a very cheap one. I don't want to burden you. - Do you need money? - I have no money. - But look... - How much do you need, dad? Fine Arts in Houston, Texas, bought my prints. - And they pay in dollars. - Great, dad. It's a sure thing. I'll make you a deposit, dad. You know, darling, it's a sure thing. Otherwise, I might do something crazy to pay for it. Hey. How are you, Rosa? I'm glad you're here. Hi, Caru. Hi, Caru... Did you know your father hasn't paid for Caru's school in eight months? Are you serious? I'm serious. And do you know how I found out? The school called saying Caru might not be able to stay in school next year. That's how, Rosa. I don't care about this shitty school, mom. It sucks anyway. - She learns more from life. - C'mon, dad! It's true. Math is the calculation of uncertainty. She knows that already, she's gifted. - Yes, it's his calculation... - Calm down. We're going to... I'm calm. I'm very calm. It's the calm before the storm. You know why, Rosa? Because he bought all this junk with the last money we had. And what does he say? It's artwork. - Artwork? - It's all imagination. It's an. Handmade by the Brazilian people. We live off imagination in this house. Everything here is imagination Look at those. - I'm taking this back. - This is a piece of me. Didi, take care. I'll talk to you later. OK. Thank you, Rosa. Take good care of my suitcase. And don't forget my money. Don't talk on the phone or text while you drive. God bless you. C'mon, give me a hug. I'm crazy, crazy, crazy But I have a heart of gold in the old days, men spoke With snakes and turtles Look at the wild monkey it's not a monkey, baby It's my brother Give me a big hug, I go back and forth. And I'm here even when I'm gone. FIRST ACT A DOLL'S HOUSE - HENRIK IBSEN THE CURTAIN FALLS No, sir. I need your ID. PLAY SUBMISSIONS The line... Has moved... Hi, I'm sorry. I got stuck in traffic. The project, please, Nicolas. As I said before, this version in English is a lot better, a lot more powerful, because we removed all the technical vocabulary, so the concept is back to... Wait, I'm sorry. Is this what you have in your pen drive? Yes. I did it myself. We keep it secret. It's safe. We have a problem then, this is a theater play script. Where's the pen drive? The right file is in the pen drive. In the pen drive, where is it? C'mon guys, it's in the pen drive. It's a theater play script. Did you save it on the cloud? - Check the cloud. - No. Did you bring your laptop? Hi, Nicolas. I know. I know, Nicolas. I made a huge mistake, sorry. I'm sorry. No. It won't happen again. I know it was bad, Nicolas. Yes, but it's not my fault you don't do your work. I do everything by... You won't even give me credit, people at the office think that I carry folders around. Nicolas, it won't happen again. m not stupid, on the contrary! Nicolas, you know what? Take this report and shove it up your ass! We just got a little bit poorer now, but I feel great. At least I won't have to buy those horrible suits anymore. - Wow, that's what 1 call being supportive. - It's the truth! So, you get to chase your "humble dream" of saving the Amazon Rainforest, with no other income source but your "dream" doesn't bring money into the house. Is that it? Are you worried that you're going to have to support this family? Are you? Maybe that too. But that's not all. What worries me is to see you like that. Like what? Feeling lost, not knowing what to do or where to go. Talking on the phone like... Like an animal. I'm fed up. I've had enough. I don't want to pretend to be a woman that can handle everything. Because I'm not. So, ask for help. We're all fucked anyway. The way we deal things... You travel anytime you want, you do whatever you want because you know I'm here to take the girls to school, to check their homework, to buy food. Forget it. It's different. So, do you think I never had to give anything up? Do you? What have you given up, Dado? Do you know how long it's been since I played soccer with my friends? - You gave up soccer... - Yes! I gave up my desire to write. To write a play. To be a playwright. I write bathroom ceramics portfolios. I've had enough. I'm tired. I've been tired for fifteen years. Go to bed. I'm coming. Do you want to say anything else? No. - Are you going on a trip? - Yeah. - Wasn't it next week? - No, baby, it's today. - Mom, 1 need help. - I'm going to help you. Nara, wait! Hey, let's take a breath, let's keep the peace and calm. I'll help you, OK? Are you feeling better? Don't you have your goggles? - Yes, but they're stained. - Wash them with fresh water. - What do you need? - I need help with my homework. - So you'll have to wait. - And I need a kiss. - Mom! - Bye, Rosa. - My goggles are stained. -| need help with my homework. Can I get a kiss? - What, Nara? - My goggles are stained! I heard you! Let's get you new ones. Don't talk to me like that. Don't give me orders. If you want to talk, we can talk. But not like that. C'mon, let's do your homework. My goggles are stained... I'm not sure I know how to help you. My goggles are white! Dado, you haven't signed the slip! Dado! Anything else? - Anything else? - No, it's fine. Hey, Juliana's mom! Hey, Henrique's dad. What's up? You didn't come to the PTM. I couldn't, Juju had a fever. I don't see wine in your can. You're not taking any? Well, Nara sometimes complains. - Yeah? - Yes. She wants to get better soon. How long have they been on homeopathy? Since always. I'm never talking to her again. Don't say that. - I don't have the stomach for it. - Give it time. You never screwed up with your daughters? - She did what she could. - Pedro! Imagine how many times she wanted to tell you. - But the way she did it... - It was the way she found. - She said it the way she could. - Pedro. It's decided. I'm never seeing her again. - I don't want to know... - You have to know who this guy is, -how this story ends. - My father... Where you came from, what you're made of. - I've had a father for 38 years. - Sure, sure. Nothing's changed for me. Whatever. Are you really that strong? Are you Super Rosa? You think this is being strong? "I don't need to know anything, life goes on." - Are you the woman of steel? - It can also be fear. It's all a front, Pedro. I never go for what I believe in. You're beautiful. Talk to her. I thought I'd never see you again. Me too. I came to tell you that if you wanted to mess up with my identity, you did it. You were so cold and selfish. Did you ever try to put yourself in my shoes? I can only put myself in my shoes. No one would understand why I did that, nor you or anyone. I can understand your anger towards me, but if 1 had to do it all over again, I would. In the same way. Including the way you told me? I really can't understand you. I can't understand how anyone can choose lies instead of the truth. A lot of people prefer lies and don't even know it. That's what you've taught me: lying instead of telling the truth. Roberto Nathan. What about Roberto Nathan? Chief of Staff. The person who actually runs this country. Don't you prefer the truth? Roberto Nathan was the guy you met in Cuba? That's for sure. Well... Some time ago, I looked for Lucio, a common acquaintance. He was very nice. He asked how I was, how you were. He asked me not to let this story leak, because it would surely serve the opposition in the election. I agreed. But whether he talked to Roberto Nathan, I don't know. I've had this lump in my throat for 38 years. During our Sunday lunch, I had two stories to tell. That was one of them. What else? Rosa, 1 ran from all doctors because I was sure they would tell me to stop smoking. But the night crisis became unbearable. In a nutshell: my lungs are great. But my pancreas, darling... It's gone. And you keep on smoking. I don't think you understood what I just said. I was diagnosed with irreversible pancreatic cancer. With severe complications. I only have a few months left. That's it. Listen, m not afraid to die, darling. I've had a wonderful life. But I had to tell you this story. But I'll never stop smoking. Did you go to another doctor to get a second opinion? It's been confirmed. You're not even using this spoon. I'm using it to stir the pasta. So it doesn't burn. Stop! Watch what you're doing! - Me? - Yes, you made me spin it. Eat up. Good, huh? It's all over the carpet! Dado, c'mon! Girls, you're spilling it everywhere. Do we get a drink with this meal? Yes, it comes with a drink we haven't prepared yet. Because this food is not going down. The pasta is the drink, then. ‚ÄúA secret, mom? What kind of secret?‚Äú ‚ÄúA very old secret,‚Äú said his mom. "Something I learned from my mom. And that my mom learned from her mother. And that now I'm going to teach you. It's called "the super kiss on the hand". The raccoon's mother grabbed his left hand, opened it, patted it, and kissed the palm of his hand. And every time the raccoon was afraid, he felt his mother by his side forever, and that he would never be afraid of anything, nor any changes. Because he had his mother's heart in the palm of his hand. And his mother's heart would follow him, root for him. It would always be close to his own heart. The end. This is a very childish story. Why did you pick this one? Because your sister likes it. I'll read you another one tomorrow. Are you crying, mom? Of course not, the raccoon was crying. Mommy's raccoon. Good night, good night. Give me a kiss. Are you leaving? I want a good-night kiss. Come here, now. Who has the best kiss? - Are you going out? - Yes. - Where to? - Dinner at Bruno's. A meeting with fellow sociologists and anthropologists. - We'll discuss... - Women anthropologists. The forest code and its impact on the tribes. Do you need me to stay? I can stay... No way. Who am Ito get in your way, you need to save the planet. Bye bye. Tell us Eve's story. Yeah mom, tell us this one. No more stories, everybody to bed now. Heads on your pillows, close your eyes, lights out. C'mon, girls. I'm staying here until you fall asleep, but you're going to bed now. BRAZIL'S CHIEF OF STAFF FROM FEBRUARY 3rd, 2014 TO DATE - Hi. - Hi. Are you still standing strong? Not so strong. Talk to me. It's nothing. I just felt like hearing your voice. That cheesy All Star pick-up line will do. - Hello? HI bring you car! Sagan's book tomorrow. No hurry to return it. Sorry, Pedro. I didn't mean to put you in this position. No, that's OK. Deal. See you. - Hi, dad! - Hi. How are you, darling? How are you doing? I was at the hotel, but I came here to thank you for the deposit. Thank you very much. It's OK. I thought you had come for the puppets. What's wrong, Caru? I'm OK. Where can I leave my stuff? On the couch. - I'm going to sleep on the couch? - What? I'm sleeping on the couch? What do you mean? Are you staying the night? The hotel was filthy, moldy. Very moldy, it's bad for her breathing. You didn't tell her? No, I didn't. I knew she would instantly get emotional. I thought Caru was with Didi. She's with you at the hotel, then. - Yes, she's with me. - It's OK, Caru... I don't want to impose, but she's suffering, you know. Suffering is part of being human, right? Everything is suffering, we have to turn it into joy. Did you have any feedback from the Fine Arts gallery? Fine Arts said they're buying everything. - It's all set. - That's great. I came to tell you that, but I got emotional and... I want to take a shower. Where can I get a towel? In the bathroom. I'll put a mattress for you in the girls' room. Is that Nathan? I was doing some research for a job... I voted for him for senator. Anyway, senators, politicians, the government, they don't matter. The people make history in Brazil. The government is fiction. The only miraculous country in this sense. The people do everything. I mean... In practice, the theory is different. Even if there's no faith or hope left, love will still shine in the universe. Here in $50 Paulo. It's so good to see you laugh. I love you. No, I love you. The puppets. Can I get the puppets some other day? OK. - It's just that... - It's OK. - I'm a little weak. - It's OK. Thank you, honey. Isn't the government doing a lot of cutbacks? It's the opposite. The government is settling scores internally... Caru, do you think I look like this guy? What guy? This minister being interviewed. I don't know, I hate politics. Look. You mean the way he speaks or... No, the face. He's nothing like you. But the way he speaks is similar. I can't explain. Why? Dado, I need your help. Wake up, let's get the girls ready for school. You go, babe. I woke up every day at 4 a.m. during the trip, I'm tired. Fuck, Dado. - Come here with me. - No, I have to take the girls to school. - I have to make them breakfast. - I miss you. Me too, I miss you so much. - Come here, babe, just a bit. - Stop, Dado! Dammit. Good morning, my babies. Good morning, Juju. It's time to wake up. I can't have a bike with a flat tire in the middle of my living room. It's there to remind you I want to ride it to school. I've told you you're not doing it, baby. It's dangerous. But I want to, dammit! Not happening, Nara! You are my daughter, and for now I decide how you're getting to school. But I want to! But you're not, Nara. I think it's dangerous. This bike is staying here. No, it's not staying here. Yes, it is. When you have your place, you can put your bike in your living room. As long as you're my daughter living in my place, I won't have a bike with a flat tire in front of the bookshelf. No, leave it here! Stop, Nara! Just stop! Mom, I want to ride my bike to school. A lot of people do! That's not a reason. I don't want it, I think it's dangerous and that's it. - No! - End of discussion. End of discussion! Got it? - Come here. - No! C'mon! - Come here. - No! Shall we go for a bike ride on Sunday? - I don't know. - Yes. We'll fix the tire, OK? Shit! Henrique! It's different, but... Did you like it? Yeah, it was really big. Where's Dado? I didn't force you to get in... - Dado, can you help me out? - Just a second, I'm finishing a call. I'm setting the table, making dinner all by myself. Just a second. I'll wait for your report, e-mail me when it's done. - I have to go. All the best. - No worries. Take care. What do you need? "All the best?" Yeah, I was saying good-bye. What do you want? Do you think I'm stupid, Dado? Stupid? No, why? Are you...? Oh no, Rosa. Please. Is it that time of the month? 1 can't believe that. m here, doing 200 things at the same time... - Why didn't you ask for help? - And you on Skype -flirting with that tree-hugger. - Flirting? Silvana is her name. Yes, Silvana. Now you're telling me I was flirting with her? Do you seriously believe that? Are you having an affair with this girl, Dado? - What are you talking about? - It's a question. No, I'm not having an affair with her. Rosa, for God's sake, I know you're going through a lot, and you're insecure. But please understand I'm on your side, I'm not having an affair. Please, listen to your yourself. ‚ÄúAM the best‚Äú? - Is she your soccer mate? - You want to have a discussion? I have a good topic. Let's talk about sex. Our sex. Which hasn't happened in months, by the way. And I happen to miss it. Maybe you don't care, but I do. OK? It's totally unrelated, OK? All the best. They're not worth a penny, but they're beautiful and I want the girls to have them when they turn 15. I don't think it's cool that you're giving things away. It's not good for you or for people around you. But I like it, darling. It's a pleasure for me to assign my belongings. Do you know what pleasure is? I'm not here to be lectured or have you tell me how to live my life. Besides, who told you I don't have pleasure? You don't know anything about me, never have. I'm going to smoke a cigarette. This is your problem, not mine. You don't know me, mom. You keep saying I don't have pleasure. I'll tell you something. You know what gave me great pleasure? Watching the commercials. I've always preferred commercials to the news. And you made me feel guilty for that my entire life. And I'm not guilty. I'm going to get another cigarette. You turned it down, you... I'm talking to you! - I'm getting another cigarette. - You turned the TV down during the commercials because you knew I liked them and said you didn't want me to become a consumerist. Did you become one? No. I didn't come here to argue. 1 came here because I want you to tell me your common acquaintance's number of the new father you gave me. Well, I know I wrote it down on a piece of paper. I don't know where it is. What was his name, do you remember? Leandro? Do you know what? I lost the paper. So now a good marriage is based on sex? We have a horrible relationship, we fight all day, but if we have sex at night, it's all good. But if we fight all day but don't have sex, we should split up. So it's not about the marriage, it's just about the sex. Calm down, Rosa. You're flustered. Yes, I do think sex is important. Without sex, there's no marriage. OK. But have you stopped to think what makes a woman want to have sex? Horniness. And what makes a woman feel horny? A nice guy who's present. If you want me horny at night, you must help me during the day with the chores. I can't just forget about all that at night and come. It's not that simple. When do you want to have sex? Never, Rosa. I'm not here to talk about sex. What I want to discuss is why I don't have enough desire to have sex. That's the point. Do you desire other people? Do you? - I know he does. - I'm talking about you. Do you desire? Tell me where I can find a frying pan. - There. - Here? It's really here. - One more egg. - Dad, can I break one? Wait... Dad, there are bits of shell in it. - Oh my God. - Just take them off, no problem. That's gross! Where is it? Do me a favor. Stir it with this fork. - Get a clean one. - I've just washed this. What is it? I burned myself on the frying pan. Stick it under water. - It hurts! - Calm down, it'll get better. Hi, babe. It's me. How are you doing? The girls asked about you, I don't know what to say. I don't know where you are, if you're OK. I'm worried... What is it? What is it? I can't sleep. Do you want to sleep here with daddy? My little monkey. My little monkey is going to sleep here. The other little monkey is here too. Ju, Nara, wake up. I overslept, we have to get you to school. Ju? Nara? What? You have school today. Ju! Are you kidding me? I don't want to go. C' man. How's your finger? - Nara! - It's mom. - Let me answer. - Dad, let me talk to her. It's just a text. She says she loves you very much, that she misses you and that she'll be back soon. THEY WANT YOU! CALL THEM. What did she say? She said that when you're in bed, she'll call to tell you a story. - Tell her we want Eve's story. - Yeah, Eve's story. THEY WANT EVE'S STORY Go put on your Pas and brush your teeth. To the woman the Lord said: "I will greatly multiply your pain. In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be for your husband, And he will rule over you.‚Äú That's horrid, Rosa. What is this book? The Bible they keep here in the hotel room. That's absurd, so wrong. I'm not listening to that. Come back, Auntie Caru! The Chief of Staff will see you soon. He's at a meeting with the president. Thank you. Hi. How are you? - I'm OK, you? - I'm OK. Do you know why I'm here? Yes. I'll try to be as honest as possible. I can't show affection that I don't feel yet. I'd like to be moved now, but I'm not. I'm not moved either. Actually, I don't know what I'm feeling. I'd rather have met you somewhere else. I'm not bothered by the place. I don't care about politics, unlike my mother. So getting to know the political backstage is even kind of fun. I'm less and less interested in the world of politics. But I'm buried to the neck in it. I have no choice. Something in this place makes me feel artificial. An impostor. can you understand that? It's not your privilege alone. Or this place's. Do you also feel like that? Not all the time, but yes. 1 ask myself several times during my day if m doing what Yd like to be doing. Well, I guess I have a Master's degree on that. I can imagine. But this feeling I'm constantly wearing a mask is not the worst part. The most difficult thing is to find someone who doesn't feel fake when talking to me. Sometimes it feels as if even my own kids are strangers. Your siblings. You have two granddaughters, did you know? So I heard. Juliana and Nara. Funny, but the word "granddaughters" moves me a little. My presence here must be a little scary to you. It's natural. "Granddaughters" sounds sweeter. Yes, possibly. It's strange, because ll: feels really good to be here with you. We've just met, but the way you look at me... That's good. I was looking for this book. I wanted to give you this one, no other. And I also wanted to ask you something. I can't keep in touch with you right now, it's delicate for my family. When I leave office, maybe in two years, I'll look for you. Sure, this whole thing is very strange anyway. I think I just came because... I wanted to know the man my mother said was my father. I know the consequences of this story are very awkward for everyone. And maybe my mom's crazy. I think I'm going to take a DNA test anyway. My head is a mess. I need to know where I came from. It's not a matter of... You don't need to take any tests. Our similarities are remarkable. Take the book. You'll be imprisoned and one day you'll escape. Where are the loves of my life? Hi, sweeties. Hey, how are you doing? How was the trip? It was unbelievable. So crazy I can't even... Did you guys talk? - ROBERTO NATHAN'S OFFICE - Answer it, mom. - Yeah, answer it. - C 'm on! Answer, answer, answer! Hello? No, I'm already in Sao Paulo. What did I forget? Oh, OK. It's 410 Albuquerque Lins St. apartment 801. Pass the ball! The zip code is 05431-000. Thank you. Guys, not my father's puzzles, please. - Puzzles? - Puppets! Not my father's puppets! Goal! Amazing goal! Goal! - Hello? - Hi, is this Cintia's house? - This is Rosa, Homero's daughter. - Just a second. Martial arts are the principle of every art form. - Homero, how boring. - Chinese medicine is longevity... Dad? It's health and also an aphrodisiac. - No, no. - Yes! - But 1 don't like that. - It's aphrodisiac. I can't squat like that, my knee would hurt. Sorry to barge in, the door was open. Hi, Rosa! This is Cintia. - Nice to meet you. - Rosa. How are you, Cintia? My heart is pounding, it's about to explode. Cintia told me I can stay here for as long as I want. For as long as he wants. Rosa, this print behind you -is Cintia's favorite. - So beautiful. It's going to be a featured print at the exhibition. You know what I think? Your work is no fad, it's got personality, power. It's got a youthful vigor that I haven't seen in years. It's somewhat synthetic, contemporary. She owns a collective gallery. It overflows with union. Cintia, I need to steal him for a minute. - Sure. Go. - A five-minute coffee break. This coffee is not very good. Cintia's coffee is much better. - Let me tell you something. - Yes, please. So... Wait, it's difficult to say it. You have to say it. Confessing is good. But it doesn't have to be a confession, you could say it to yourself out loud and I can listen to it. You see, the human being is anguish. If you talk, it dissolves. You communicate. And I'm your father, it'll do you good. - My mother came to me. - Yes? She told me about her trip to Cuba, a bit before I was born. And she told me, dad, that actually... I know! Do you think she's bothered by Cintia? You think? Every time I start dating someone, she sends me a message. Because love is forever, we're forever connected. But this is the joy that comes from the sexual encounter, which is the divine grace of love, and how our species survives. But you see, my father was like that, my grandfather was like that, and so on. This is hereditary, it's in our DNA, it's our heritage. It's destiny on one hand, and Jesus of Nazareth's free will on the other. When divorce comes Our situation will get better You're getting married to yet another woman who's going to pay your way? What can I do? Oh my darling... It's all a big Carnival. Who says the samba school Won't parade Obviously has no brain And I'm going to laugh Ha Ha Ha Ha And I'm going to laugh Ha Ha Ha Ha Laugh at yourself. Laughing at others is Fascism, Nazism. But laughing at yourself is the solution. Shall we get the check? Let's get the check. How did it go in Brasilia? Did Roberto say anything about me? Yes, he did. So? Well, mom... He said you were a different kind of woman, that you had this autonomy about you, something special that caught his eye at the time. And he also said you were pretty. One more tail to his collection. Roberto was much more important to me than I was for him. - That's not what it seemed. - It's Mathematics. Men have dozens of affairs during their lives. I only had one. You're generalizing. Every man has affairs? You didn't know that? You know,... With Roberto... Sex with Roberto Nathan wasn't the best thing ever. The beginning with your father was unbeatable. But with Roberto I had the most passionate encounter. You can spare me the details, mom. When you accept the transgression, darling, you become a much better person. Do you recommend it? Definitely. - Hi, good evening. - Yay! - Do you accept some wine? - Please. - Thank you. - Thank you. I feel just like Nora. You know the main character in lbsen's "A Doll's House"? No. Is this a good or a bad thing? - It's great. - Great? The play ends with her leaving everything behind. Husband, home, family. She realized her marriage only existed because she never questioned anything. Because she was totally alienated. So she realizes she doesn't have to submit to a man anymore to be respected as a woman, you know? - That's nice. - Liberation. Cheers to Nora. And what does she do after... - Then the play's over! - Over? Yeah, it's over. It's simply over, Nora? Ops, sorry. It's Rosa, right? What happens then? What does Rosa want? - What are you looking for? - This is a very hard question. But I do know what I want. A guy who's present, who feels like a partner and who knows that the differences between men and women are minimal. And I also want to have several men. Like, try different men. To be able to compare. I should have written this line in the second act of my play. So do it. Now I can't. I missed the deadline, it's gone. But do you write for the contest, or for yourself? Can I have some more? She sings, she talks, she screams, she wanders She has that sexy way about her And I won't tell whom its for She has a panther That she drags on a leash She likes this beast For it is a great sorceress And seduces all the hearts Super woman Super woman in her flying cape She is a lion tamer Super woman - What's up, Caru? - Hi, Rosa. This is Tocha, we do boxing together at the gym. How's it going, Tocha? You don't look as square as Caru said you were. But I think I'm very square. Cam, here's not the place. The girls are here. Sci‚Äú!- Now she seems very square. Rosa, didn't you read the article I left for you? I don't know what you're talking about. I put an article in the little notebook you carry around. I put it in there. And what does it say? Do you really think this square family model lasts a lifetime? The article says this kind of relationship has to change. People will live for 300, and nobody will be able to stay square and monogamous for that long. Or this patriarchal family model continues, based on lies, with everybody cheating and pretending to be saints. Or they'd like to cheat, but don't, and remain frustrated and unhappy. Caru, I think this all sounds great. But we can talk again when you have kids. Do you think being a mother is about being imprisoned at home like a nun in a convent? Let's go, Tocha. - Bye, Tocha. - Bye bye. SECOND ACT FREE LOVE POLIGAMY: LOVE WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED BERNARDO: IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED? NORA: YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHAT I WANT. THE SECOND SEX BY SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR NOMADS FREE LOVE Clarice, if you're willing, I can prescribe some formulas that will help control your anxiety and quit smoking. I've tried, but I can't. Really. 1 can't believe that replacing my blue, tasty, ethereal, inebriant smoke with this little sugar pill is going to save my life. Which one do you prefer, the red or the brown one? For you, I'd say the brown one. I prefer the red one. It's the last shoe I'm going to buy. Why do you ask my opinion? Why do you have to say it's the last shoe you're buying? - Because it's true. - Just get in there and buy it. It's like you want to annoy me. You know I can't be angry at you, I'm supposed to pity you. - Don't get flustered. - You crossed the line, mom. It's like you take pleasure in saying that even for death -you're more prepared than I am. - But what can I do if I'm OK with it? Are you saying you're strong and I'm weak? So what if we disagree? Are you afraid of being challenged, of being criticized? - Watching TV this late? - Daddy let us. - Where's daddy? - In the bathroom. Enough, guys- - Just until the show's over. - You have to get up early. - It's the last season. - No! - No, Nara! - Hello? It's Nara. Since when do you answer your father's phone? Sometimes I use it, I know the password. And the person hung up on you? When I said my name, she hung up. She? C'mon, guys. Let's go. You're buying time. Before you go, unlock your dad's phone. It could be an important call. - Let's play Vamp. - Yeah'.! AMAZING AFTERNOON! - Who are you going to be? -| want to go to bed. - No, no, no! - It's super fun and healthy. It's funny how you play the engaged environmentalist, but at home you waste water as if it weren't an issue. I just got in the shower. What's up? What was so amazing about your afternoon with that bitch? It's not my fault or the girls' that you're stressed out. You got a message and a call and Nara answered it. - And what does it say? -"Amazing afternoon." - From Silvana? - Are you fucking around with me? Can you hear me out? A law firm from New York contacted us today saying they're going to support us in court in favor of the Yanomamis' cause. A huge firm. The biggest in New York. They called us this afternoon. Don't you think that's amazing? Mom, there's a man for you on the phone. And he didn't say who he was. Tell him I can't talk now. Why did she hang up the phone? Rosa, I don't know. How could I? Mom, he says it's urgent. Answer, babe. Hello? Yes, it's me. Who's that? Yes, I'm her daughter. Which room? I'm on my way. Two months. It could be six. It could be two years. That's not what he said. How many a day? My darling, you have no idea how good this feels. I remember when you decided to give all your dolls to the maid's daughter. - I almost died. - Really? I don't remember you getting so upset. When I saw those empty shelves, it was as if somebody had died. I sat in your room and cried myself a river. My goodness, the pain! I wasn't ready for that. - And how can we get ready? - We can't. Children start leaving as soon as they're born and never stop. And we just have to deal with it. You know mom, Nara's being very aggressive to me. Darling, this has no end. Look at you. C' man'.! Your whole life you talked to me holding a whip, Rosa. But that's the way it is. There comes a time when the definition of "mom" in the dictionary is "the one who knows nothing". We become perpetual idiots. But I'm not complaining. I just don't want you to be surprised. My mother forgot to tell me. It took me a long time to understand. Let's go. It's not very different for me at home. - It's difficult, isn't it? - Hey, Juliana's mom! What's up, Henrique's father? I wanted to tell you something. There's a foreign physicist here in Brazil and the university guys wanted to hold an event with him in Ilhabela Thursday and Friday this week. We need an interpreter. Can I give them your name? It's not a lot of money, but... Are you going to say no to work? Yes, sure. - OK, great. Bye! - Bye. I want to end by quoting some famous words of Carl Sagan "Every child is born as a scientist and this we pulled from them" - Difficult subject. - It was beautiful. So you're spending an entire year in a desert island and you can take only one dessert with you. Chocolate ice cream. - Every day? - Well, yes. - Chocolate ice cream it is. - It's only one, right? Hi, how's it going? I'm going to let you take a book too. Because I'm a good person. - Can I take my time? - No. The boatman is ready to row to the desert island. - I don't know any of these books. - Choose by the title. - I pick the blue one. - The blue one. How much is it? Now you can take one kitchen appliance too. - That's easy, an oven. - Oven. It'll be very useful with your chocolate ice cream. FALLEN PRINCESSES -in the Middle Ages... - No, before that, in prehistoric times. Physical strength made sense then, in order to ensure the group's survival. The man was the strongest person there, so he was the leader. Perfect. But nowadays, physical strength is not important at all. And you wanted to drive here. It has nothing to do with physical strength. - I didn't want you to get tired. - Why would I? - It's a courtesy. - It's in the collective unconscious. It's something we're not aware of. - Men want to be the protagonists, - It's history. - With women as their audience. - Not all of us. On behalf of every man in the world, I ask for forgiveness. It wasn't on purpose. It just happened and it kept on happening. - I know, I don't think... - I'm sorry. I know it's history, but men still have higher wages. Physical strength doesn't matter anymore, but men still rule the world. I want to drive on the road, dammit! OK, you can drive. I'm rebellious, I know. Dado says I'm furious. But there's so much on us. We can't do everything perfectly. And you don't have to. Relax. My grandma used to say that wanting things to be perfect is just a boring way not to give yourself away. Relax. You don't have to be perfect, that's boring. Are you real? Or is this the beach you? The first three days are good. Then I become a criminal. Talking to you, I'm hopeful that there are men who understand women. Women? I do what I can to know something about pleasing them. I think you know a lot about pleasing too. - Me? - Yes, you. - How do you know? - I can feel you transpiring femininity! I've worked hard for that. And I have supporting documents in my property. I have your feminist manifesto at home. - Feminist manifesto? - Your play that I have with me. - I was so glad you read it. - I did. It's new to me to talk to an erotic feminist. Erotic feminist! That's rich. And specially an erotic feminist who wears blue All Star. So I don't know how to handle it. - I love this cheesy pick-up line. - The All Star one? I haven't used it yet. Your play is really good. The primitive man is delighted by the sensitive lady. - The primitive man wants to take... - Stop, Pedro! ...the creative playwright home. The primitive man wants to cook for the sensitive lady. I'm not very bright or sensitive, but I can use my opposable thumb. I'm really good at opening mayo jars. - That's very important. - It's like an an form. And if you want to use this brute force, for anything other than opening mayo jars, I'm... I'm totally at your disposal. Sacred moment in my day. My second cigarette. I unconsciously got here for your second cigarette. Did you come just because I'm dying or did you want to say something? I came to show you some photos. Come here. Look how fun they are. Wait a minute. - Isn't it great? - This is really good! offered as a volunteer to the photographer. Do you know anything about photography? Not about photography, but this theme I know really well. I can smell crisis in the air. Dado and I are very different. I don't know who said a couple has to sleep together every night. One minute you're hot, then you're cold. There's insomnia, snoring. One likes the lights out, the other doesn't. Your grandma solved this problem by having separate rooms. I wish that was the only problem. But I actually came here to thank you for taking me to Rita Lee's concert when I was a kid. Finally, something I did right! Hi Debora, this is Rosa. Yes, Renata's friend. She told me you were looking for someone to write your catalogue. !sent you my r√©sum√© by e-mail. No, 1 usually write texts for websites... DADO IS A GOOD GUY! You were right. About the red shoes. JUST LIKE OUR PARENTS SOCIOLOGY AND EDUCATION CONFERENCE, CUBA. The play actually starts with the curtains coming down, as if it were lbsen's "A Doll's House" ending. But then we see it's not the end. It's the beginning. The play is about Nora, the protagonist, nowadays. Ibsen's play ends and yours begins, is that it? What did she do? Who is she now, after leaving that family model behind? It's about the Nora in me, in you. Women in general in the present moment. I really want a woman to direct this play. Let me see it. Very interesting. I'll definitely take a look at it. Here at school, we've been offering children some extra time for extracurricular activities. So we can feel how children are living their relationship with freedom. And we've noticed that it's not very easy for children to do that. They ask what they're supposed to do all the time, or complain there's nothing to do. So we invite you to try this at home. Give children idle time, don't give them too many guided activities. Don't leave them with people who tell them what to do all the time, with excessive care. Children need to be able to put freedom into practice. Because that's where they'll exercise the desire muscle. What do they desire? Look at that. - What's up, babe? - How are you doing? I'm good. You? Where are the girls? I put them in bed already. That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. See that? WE LOVE YOU, GRANDMA The girls had trouble falling asleep, you know? They cried a little, they wanted to see you. Are you OK? Give me your foot. Wait. Just a second. You know I think you have beautiful feet, right? Seriously. If you're hungry, there's some pasta on the stove. I don't know if it's al dente, Is it good? Yeah. You see, I'm getting better. HI soon be a chef in the tribes. Did you throw your sneakers in the trash can? Did you throw them away? Keep going, it was so good. There. Dado? It's not good. But you asked me to do it. You want it softer? I'm talking about our marriage. What do you mean? We had sex like two teenagers two days ago. How is that bad? It was great for me. Wasn't it for you? Didn't we agree that we'd always tell each other the truth? Yes. So? Are you having an affair with that anthropologist, Silvana? Rosa, please. How many times have I told you I'm not having an affair with anyone, let alone her. There's nothing. You've already... We... Since we're telling the truth, is there something you want to tell me? Ifell in love with another guy. Fuck But it's over now. Dado. It's over. But I feel that if we don't change our relationship, it'll happen again. Anytime. I love you. But I feel that if you were honest with me, if you played fair. I'd even be able to control my jealousy. Are you proposing an open relationship? No. I'm not proposing an open relationship. I'm proposing we tell each other the truth. I had to tell you. I couldn't take it anymore. I can't take any more lies in my life. Not one. I want it to be different. I didn't lie to you. I don't believe you, Dado. I don't. Why not? I have a gut feeling. A gut feeling, you know? Gut feeling. Here, love, fill this up for me.
