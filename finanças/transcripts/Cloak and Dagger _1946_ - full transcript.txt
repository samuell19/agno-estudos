- C'est moi. - Thought you'd never show up. We're crowding call time. Then get the piano going, this will be a short one, I'll put it in code. - Anything sensational? - No, some off pitch-blends, 40 carloads. - Heading North? - Yeah, for Germany. Highball, he didn't even get the chance to sign off. Pitchblende from Czechoslovakia, pitchblende from Spain. Two hundred and fifty carloads out of Germany in the past 30 days. And British intelligence says they've taken the whole output of monazite from Norway. Our trouble is, we haven't enough people who can analyze scientific data. Pitchblende and monazite. I'll be out of town till tomorrow. I've got to talk to somebody who can analyze it. - Who is there? - An old fraternity brother. Why Clem, how are you? Don't know how I am. I've been wandering through cellars and breaking down doors trying to get to you. - Are you hiding something from me? - No. But what are you hiding from me? I thought you were in the army. Just to put you in your place, I'm a colonel. - Then why the civilian clothes? - I'm in O.S.S. Never heard of it. Well, that's fine, we're not supposed to get any publicity. It's the office of Strategic Services. Around Washington we're called the Cloak & Dagger boys. - Sounds romantic. - Sure, very. We do a lot of things Alvin. Intelligence work, morale stuff, operations behind the enemy lines. Why you telling me all this if it's so hush-hush? How's work in nuclear physics these days? - So-so. - Don't close up on me. Well, it's hush-hush too Clem, government work. I know, you're working on the Manhattan project. That's why I'm here. What is this mean to you? Pitchblende is for Uranium, monazite is for Thorium. We're not working with Thorium anymore, 235 has a more convenient atomic structure. Any chance the Germans have learned something about Thorium we don't know? The Germans? I wouldn't think so, but... quantities like these aren't for the laboratory, are for large-scale operations. Do you think they might be working on an atomic bomb too? We've all wondered. They got the brains, they know as much about nuclear fission as we do. Well Alvin, they are working on an atom bomb. Clem... this is the first time I was ever sorry I'm a scientist. Why? Look... in a few years maybe, we'll be able to break up the atomic structure of this apple. When we do that, it will become a bomb. The energy in this one, little apple could pulverize this university, this whole town... its fine hospitals, its libraries... its wonderful medical schools, to say nothing of all the people in it. But... we still wouldn't be able to make one, little apple. We're running ahead of ourselves. Society isn't ready for atomic energy. I'm scared stiff. For the first time, thousands of allied... scientists are working together to make what? A bomb. But who was willing to finance science before the war to wipe out tuberculosis? And when are we going to be given a billion dollars to wipe out cancer? I tell you, we could do it in one year. But if anybody is going to develop the Atom bomb, you want it to be us. - Not the Nazis. - Not much choice in that. Alvin, we need more trained men on this. We've got to know how far the Germans have gone. Where they're working? How we can stop them? Most of our agents aren't equipped. They don't know what to look for. They're missing clues, I know. This is a race. It's the Germans or us. We got to get more scientists into our outfit. How about what I'm doing here? I'm already authorized to take you off. You know the problem, you're single, you can speak a little German. But you got to volunteer. There was a time when I thought I'd like to become some sort of a secret agent. But I gave it up at the age of eight. Ok brother, you're now a spy. I got two plane tickets back to Washington. Can I even have time to wind things up here? Ordinarily we'd give you a few weeks. I want you to take a look at this. Know her? Dr. Katherine Lodor, one of the great ones. Used to be my scientific pin-up girl before Hungary sold out to the Nazis. I suppose now she's right in the center of German atomic work. - She's in Switzerland. - Since when? About six weeks. She came over the Alps, alone. She's been in a hospital in Zurich with pneumonia. Few days ago she got in touch with the American consulate. Said she wanted to see one of our scientists. You don't know how happy that makes me feel. Say, if she's just out of Germany she can tell us... this is a terrific break. If you stop feeling so happy about it and go home and pack a... - bag you could see her in a couple of days. - Ok. I hope you find your room satisfactory. Danke schoen. - Very sorry sir. - Alright. - Here you go. - Danke sehr. Don't turn around. The lady you want to see is at the Angelo hospital. Room 168, she's there under the name of Mrs. Hickerty. You may come in. Not too long please Mr. Wilson. What is your real name Mr. Wilson? - Alvin Jesper. - I know your work. Thank god you've come, you don't know how indebted I am to you. To me? When people find out what you've done they'll know you're not only a great physicist... - but a great woman. - Maybe, the story isn't ended yet. What will people think? What will you think? - If I were to go back to Germany? - Go back? Oh, but that isn't why you crossed the alps or got in touch with us. No, but you see I thought I'd be safe here. I'm not, the Germans have found me here. Yesterday I got a letter postmarked Zurich, I'm to go to Italy to work. I've been collaborating there with Polda. - Giovanni Polda? - Yes. If I don't return... beginning Sunday, ten anti-Nazi Hungarians are to be taken out of concentration camps... and shot each day. Each day, they promise me a letter with names. With photographs of the dead people. So the Germans are working on atomic weapons? Italians too, they work coordinated. Then what would happen if you went back and your work helped them to succeed? What would happens if I stay here? I can not live... day by day knowing that innocent people are being shot because of me. I'd to go back. I'll take poison. I can't decide any other way. Suppose you went back to work with Dr. Polda? But you met difficulties in your work, obstacles. - Understand? - Yes. That's possible, that's possible. And if you felt strong enough for it, you could help us too with information. - There are ways of communicating? - I think so. I'll have to discuss it, arrangements will have to be made and... Believe me, I would be strong enough for that. But you have to hurry. They've given me only until Sunday, before I go back we have to talk. I'll need every bit of information you have. If you'd only knew how the British set them back when they... bombed the heavy water plant in Norway, it meant a delay of months for them. But what if you can't arrange this? - Don't worry, it can be arranged. - I will... Oh I forgot, they keep worrying over my lungs, I'm due for an I-ray. - I'll be glad to wait. - No. Come back tomorrow morning, I'll have more strength then, we can talk all day. Don't worry about anything. Tonight I'll sleep, such good feeling to know you can sleep. - Are there any calls for me? - No sir. I'm expecting a call, will you please have me paged at the bar? Glad to sir. Oh excuse me, Lassie, what's the matter with you? I'm terribly sorry, she's always getting caught under people's feet. That's a dog's privilege. - Martini. - Yes sir. Very dry please. Ja, this must be an American. By your clothes, the drink you ordered, surely an American. By the fact that you are new in this hotel, perhaps you are just over, eh? Prosit. Tell me, oh pardon me. It's all right. Tell me friend, are we going to win? The big question is American industry. If steel production, for instance, can go to 95 million tons, then we will win. So now tell me, how are things in America, eh? Excuse me. Pardon me. Would you mind terribly if I sat down? Oh, I see, our Gestapo friend has been pumping you. - He does that to everyone new around here. - Thank you. - My name is Andrew Wilson. - Mine is Ann Dawson. - You talk like an American. - I am. You know, Fritz over there, he's not very dangerous, but he's a frightful bore. - You better stay away from him. - Mr. Wilson? Call for you Mr. Wilson. - Thank you. May I? - Certainly. - Wilson speaking. - Listen carefully. Don't say anything over this phone you don't have to. - Yes? - Something must've got snafued. You run into a double play, why did... that tootsie you're sitting with is one of the slickest operators on the other side. Knock down that brau, but not too fast, and fade, wait for me at home plate. - Trouble? - Nothing I can't handle. We're in a jam, they found out about you. Somewhere along the line you tipped them off, you made a mistake. - I followed instructions to the letter. - How did they kidnap Dr. Lodor? What are you talking about? I just saw her this morning. Between the time you saw her and now she disappeared from the hospital. She didn't walk out, she was kidnapped. I knew there was something up when I saw that Dawson woman with you. What have you been doing since the time you hit the airport? Give me every move. - I came through the customs. - What did you say? - Told them I was in watches. - Nothing else? - No. - Go on. At the barrier there was a photographer. I figured he didn't look like the real article so I didn't let him snap my photo. That's it, that's your mistake. We've been keeping away from Lodor. When you didn't let him take your picture, they knew you had a reason. So they trailed you, that's how they knew you saw Lodor. That's why they snatched her, that's why they put Dawson on you. And I thought I was being smart. Forget it. How were you to know? You're new at this business. So they kidnapped her. There's something we can do about it. Get the number of Dawson's room, I'm getting ideas. Meanwhile, let your acquaintance with this Dawson woman develop. Hello, will you tell me the number of Mrs. Dawson's room please? Thank you. No, you needn't call her. - 221. - 221. - You got a match? - Yes sir, here you are sir. Oh, don't bother sir. - I'll pick them up for you. - Thank you. Hello, you're certainly prompt, come in. Won't you sit down? Have a drink before dinner? - Thank you. - I'll just get my wrap. Never mind the wrap, we'll skip dinner this evening. Really? I have something I would like to read to you. - Oh, are you writing me poetry? - In a way, yes. This is a copy of a sonnet... which will be dropped off at the German consulate within a few minutes. It's written on bank stationery. It reads dear sirs... I am only a clerk in this bank, but I'm a true friend of Germany. You ought to know that a certain Ann Dawson, presumably friendly to us... has recently deposited with us the sum of 5,000 American dollars. Oh, that's ridiculous. She was accompanied to the bank by a tall American... whom I have never seen before. It was he who paid over the money. Signed, a watchful friend. - But I... - There's a postscript. Mrs. Dawson and that tall American seemed very fond of each other. But I don't understand. What does all this mean and... why should the German consulate be interested in me? I'm in Switzerland because of my husband. He's in the air force, he was shot down and he's interned here. - I'm an American. - Technically, yes. You were born in America You were raised there. But in 1935, you joined the German-America Bunde under the name of Hilda Winters. In 1937, you were arrested for organizing anti-Semitic and anti-negro riots. In 1939, you were in the Columbia house, Berlin, working for the Gestapo. Since 1940, you've been operating in Switzerland. Yes, you're an American all right, but it makes my stomach crawl to have to admit it. You lying pig. Do you think the Gestapo will believe a clumsy frame-up like this? I think they will, we'll find out soon enough. It's now 7:28. I'll be getting a phone call at 7:30. If you haven't told me what I want to know by then, the letter will be delivered. Why, they'll laugh at it. I rather think they'll do some checking. A woman who looks like you was in the bank with me today. Her signature was an exact duplicate of yours. Look. They must've been worried about you from time to time. They have a theory, once a German, always a German, it may apply to Americans too. They know I wouldn't betray them, they know how loyal I've been. Until an American agent went to work on you, offered you money... and at the same time, rekindled that faint spark of patriotism deep down inside you. You know, if it ever gets out why they shot you, you may end up as a heroine. All I want to know is where is Katherine Lodor? You tell me, the letter will be destroyed. Andrew please believe me, I don't know where she is. Send it. - Wait. - Hang on. She's at the Edelweiss Ski Club. Up the mountain road... from the village of Mouat. Is closed now. - How is it? - Everything in order. One guard in the library, the other upstairs asleep. Nurse asleep, Lodor's room door. Get started Eric. Take your post when we go in. The nurse, get her. Let me go. Well, that's that. In the whole world there were perhaps ten people with a mind equal to hers. Once, to solve a problem, she invented a whole new system of mathematics. - The work she still could've done. - So you came to Switzerland for nothing? - No. - You say no? She told me she'd been working with an Italian, Giovanni Polda. The leading German scientists are all Nazi party members in good standing. I corresponded with Polda before the war. - He was friendly then. - How do you know he's friendly now? I don't. But the next step has to be Italy. Thirty seconds. Seems your Italian friends are right on time, lieutenant. - Good, let's shove off Al. - Thank you captain. Good luck. - Haul her in. - Aye aye sir. Hop in Al. I suppose you rent this truck from Mussolini. Sort of, the driver works for him by day and for us at night. - All right to smoke? - Sure. - Thanks. - Grazie. Oh, meet Gina. Gina, meet Herr doctor Wilhelm of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. - We call him Al. - Hello Al. Hello. No, tre. Portamale. - Documenti Documenti. - Kill the cigarettes. - I don't talk Italian. - Not even any? Oh, I know one verse from Dante. What kind of a mission do you make this time? You're not even dressed right for a German doctor. Oh, don't worry. I'll be a German doctor all right. - Does Polda know he's coming? - We're going to surprise him. - That's crazy. - This is a very important mission Gina. Very, all of us have one job to do. That's to take Al safely in to see Dr. Polda and then take him out again. All right. Now, Polda always comes home from his laboratory for noon dinner. After that, he sleeps for one hour, then he works in his study. Does he have visitors in the afternoon? Well, in the ten days I watched the house and get reports, only three visitors came. - Who's in the house? - A housekeeper. Old woman, nice, stupid. A cook, good cook, fascist. And four secret police Ovra men, two for day, two for night. - And the chief of them is Luigi. - Is it all checked? Checked from the cook when I got him drunk one night. Checked from Dr. Romoli, dentist of Polda who is with us. Checked by Marsoli and his ways and checked by my eyes every day. Now you know what a first rate courier can do. You're so good at this, I'll get you a job at it after the war. - I don't like you to talk like that. - I was only joking. - I don't like your joking. - I'm sorry. What do you know about that Ovra man, Luigi? - Smart man, well trained. - That's comforting. How do I get to the house itself? To get to the house has been arranged. But to get inside? Dr. Nalheim from Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. Dr. Nalheim from Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. - Passaporto. - Sprechen Sie deutsch. Dr. Nalheim. Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. Danke. I'm not doctor Nalheim. - I'm an American physicist and my name is... - I don't care what your name is. - You're an American. - Dr. Polda, listen. I don't want to listen. You're insane to come here, how dare you put me in such danger? A few years ago, you wrote me a letter. At the end of it you said: Only a free science in the service of all humanity can be a good science. - Who are you? - Alvin Jesper. Grazie. Thank you. All right, I can't betray a fellow scientist. But you must be insane to come here. We have nothing to talk over. Nothing. Please go. Dr. Polda, you're working on nuclear fission. Be sensible. Go. You're working for the Nazis I know that. But I can't believe you're doing it willingly. Oh, willingly, unwillingly, what does it matter? You have no right to jeopardize me by coming here. I have the right, Katherine Lodor gave me the right. You saw Katherine? I spoke with her just before the Nazis killed her. Katherine dead. - Katherine dead. - Murdered. She died because she wouldn't let criminals use her science. - But you're letting them use you Polda. - So what do you want? That they should murder me too? - No, but I want information. - And I want my life. Is this the Giovanni Polda who resigned from the royal academy... rather than shake hands with Mussolini? All right, I've become a weakling, despise me. I don't care about people. I care about myself, only myself. You're lying, that's not the great Polda talking. What are you afraid of? What hold do they have on you? Hold? No hold, I'm free as air. All they have is the only person in the world I care about. My daughter Maria, they have her. His masters and mine. I keep his portrait here so others will think I'm patriotic... and so I can have something to hate. Not since the beginning of time... is there been a man who has a hatred like me. - Then fight them. - They have my daughter. They let her send me a postcard once a week. And I let them pick my brains. Once a week, I cry. The other nights I drink. But now they threaten to take her into Germany. I said something they didn't like, only a little thing. I forgot myself. Don't you know they can take you into Germany too? They're being pushed back here, you think they'll leave you if they retreat? No, they won't leave me. Not till I'm squeezed dry. - But still you'll serve them? - They have Maria. For her I'll serve anyone. Suppose she were safe in another country? - What? - It can be done, where is she? She's permitted to leave under guard in a hotel in Perugia. The Albergo Excelsior. Oh, let her be in England, America, give me one letter in her handwriting... - and I... - We can do better than that. We can take you out too. You are not playing with an old, sick man? - No. - It will be dangerous for her, won't it. It can be arranged, safely. - You can trust me. - Trust you? I've lived too long under fascism, I trust no one. But a business bargain I make. If you help me, I'll help you. Until then, don't think I'm a fool, I'll tell you nothing. - If those are your conditions Dr. Polda. - Yes. Do it and maybe I'll become the old Polda again. A free science in the service of humanity... can be the only good science. Come now, I'll get to take you past my watchdogs. - Auf Wiedersehen Herr Professor. - Auf Wiedersehen Dr. Nalheim. Auf Wiedersehen. Auf Wiedersehen. Getting Polda's daughter won't be any cinch. How do we go about it? He and I will go about it, you stay put. - I might be able. - You might be able to land us in the soup. That's all. How long do you think you can you wander around Italy without... running into the Gestapo or the Ovra? You think they won't check your papers with Berlin? No sir, you stay put or the deal is off. Ok, where can I stay? - You have any food stamps? - Yes. Then this is the best place. Just keep out of sight and wait. If, if we get Polda's daughter... I'll put a notice in the papers announcing the death in action of lieutenant... - lieutenant Renaldo Amadi. - Amadi? A - M - A -D - I, Amadi. When you see it, go to Romoli's, Polda's dentist. He'll have the professor there for you. There are partisan airfields in the north, we'll go out by plane. - You know the vineyard Pinaro's? - Yes. Take Polda there. - How long are you likely to be? - As long as it takes. - A week maybe. - What if you don't get Maria? What if we don't hear from you at all? The fortunes of war Al, you'll be on your own then. Here's your coat. Thank you. Grazie. - It's just like new. - Marsoli andiamo. - Good luck. - Gina, will you look outside please? It's all right. Gina, arrivederci. Arrivederci, I'll be seeing you. - Well, make yourself at home. - Thanks. Guess having me here on your hands was a little more than you bargained for. In our work we take what comes. Please stop looking me over. You're nice to look at. Just like a scene in the opera we are. The people go, the young couple is left alone. Quick, the young man must make compliments, it's expected. Only there isn't any music and you are not a tenor. Have it your own way but don't add me up before you know me. Are we going to have to listen to that all night? - Maybe you ask the cat. - You're full of vinegar, aren't you? It sounds hungry. But the people are hungry, it's only natural cats should be. Have you got any milk for it? Milk? Oh, I remember. Comes from cows, no? Good for babies. Still, I hate to hear a cat cry, maybe a piece of bread. The American likes cats, eh? Only you're in Europe now, here you find cats in butcher shops. This one is been lucky but by tomorrow maybe plop into somebody's stew pot. It's be nice to live in a country where not only cats are fed, but children. Please, I'm going to put on my nightgown. How does a girl like you get used to this kind of life? - You think anyone gets used to it? - I think you do wonderfully Gina. - I never knew a girl with so much courage. - Courage? You're a grown up man and know so little, know nothing about cats... - and nothing about people. - What's the matter with you Gina? Oh no matter, except you come from the moon. And here we live like, like Lazarus. We lie in the grave waiting for the savior to come. Only I don't come from the moon and Italians like you aren't just lying down. You're too long for the couch, you take the bed. - Listen, in this work we're comrades. - No. Ok, tomorrow you'll have a broken back, I hope. Thanks. - Hey. - Thank you. Well, I don't hear that cat anymore. In this country even the cats learn it's no use to cry. Micha, micha, micha, micha, micha. Here, I hope she has fleas. Excuse me, I have no liver with onions, only leftovers. Now you shut up and let me sleep or I'll throw you right out the window. - Good night. - Good night. - Al? - Yes? I don't mean all I said. I know you don't. - Good night. - Good night. Gina Gina. Don't be worried, everything is all right. Oh Al, why you wake me? - What? Why you frighten me like this? - You were dreaming. You were crying in your sleep. Oh yes? Oh, I remember. Oh. It might help to tell me about it. You've been fighting in the foxholes a long time, haven't you Gina? Tonight I... I say to myself... now maybe, maybe for, for a whole week... it'll be easy. Stay in the room. Sing a little, dust. Wash dishes. No. Not easy. Not even in sleep. - Signora Dominica? - Por favore, qui pasa qui? Si, aspetti un momento. E cuida me. His cat, he wants his cat. Lo fatto entrare in camara perque me abolaba e non mi laschaba dormir. Perque no lo tiene giu? Grazie, Signorina, grazie. No, non parlo italiano. Oh, congratulazione Signori, congratulazione. Questa e una grande ocasione, buona fortuna signora, ma... suo marito, e registrato con la policia. - Oh, Si. - Allora, tutto Va bene, tutto Va bene. Buona fortuna Signore. Buona fortuna Signore, arrivederla. Brava, bravissima. The cat, had to be the cat. It's always the little things. The things we can't plan that make us end up in the hands of the police. - We can't stay here any longer. - Why? - Is he an agent? - No. But every janitor has to report any new person in the house. I told him you're my husband. Why did you do that? I, I can't register with the police. - We can't risk that. - I know, I made a mistake. - You know of any other safe house? - I'm trying to think. We can't walk the streets day and night, we'd be picked up sure. I know, shut up for a minute and let me think. We're finished here. It's not your fault. I didn't have to tell him you're my husband. In our work there's no room for that sort of pride. Without pride you wouldn't be Gina. Don't be ashamed of your pride. Last night and now... you say things that that make me feel easier in here. Maybe you feel charity. Or maybe, you like people? Mostly I like cats. When was this picture taken Gina? Just before the war. A hundred years ago. Any luck? An apartment, two rooms and a bath for three days. - A bath? Who's giving us all that? - A schoolmistress I once knew. A fascist party member. I told her I had a German friend who was very important and she was very proud of me. - Tired, Gina? - Not bad, hungry? No, thanks. There's a lot of energy in an apple. What's that? Oh, I was trying to keep busy waiting for you. But what is it? It's called plotting the line integral of a sine wave. Oh, is not as difficult as it sounds. I was imagining I was riding one of those horses. Trying to figure out how far I would go altogether, going around and... up and down at the same time. Horses going up and down and kids, music. Ever come here Gina? Before the war. The music played Giovinezza all the time, a fascist song. Spoiled for me. - You come here with a boy? - Yeah. One you liked? Was in the picture with me, he played the cello. - Where is he now? - Somewhere, without his cello. Maybe after the war I might come back. And I'd bring you here but the music would be different. After the war a lot will be different. - But you won't come back. - I might, why not? It's time now, we can go. - Whoa? - Tonight I am prewar Gina. I teach my little children in school. Wednesday I play chamber music. I'm very innocent. And I'm easy to blush. - A change of clothes does all that? - Well, we'll see. I'm still pretty. No? A little bit. Well, even if you don't think so, all the Ovra men I meet, they tell me I'm pretty. I know a man, he is long and tall... he moves his body like a cannonball. Fare thee well my honey, fare thee well. - What's that? - An American cowboy song. But don't look so funny, one of your shot down fliers from New Arizona taught it to me. - New Mexico. - New Arizona. Ok, New Arizona. He taught it to me, the rest I never learned. Only the first lines, he was nice. How do I look? - Prewar. - You mean it? Of course I do. I'm no Ovra man. - Why do you say that? - You brought it up. Oh, you're jealous, I suppose, eh? - You think I couldn't be jealous? - You want me to dance, eh? Maybe I am jealous Gina. No, don't make love to me, don't be somebody I like. If you feel like kissing me and I feel like kissing you, so we kiss. But don't be serious. In my job, I kiss without feeling. Last week an Ovra man with a silly mustache, next week a fat, Gestapo pig. Gina Gina, girl. Why do you keep whipping yourself Gina? You think... you think it's good to be a courier in the underground? You think it's exciting, heroic. No, if you fight scum, you become scum, that's all. No, I know what you are. Not so far from that little girl in the picture. Go to the door. - Buona sera Signora. - Buona sera. Voi fa la carit? per I bambini... Per Le huerfani Di Guerra. Un momento. - Grazie, Que dio I benedica. - Dio la benedica. - Who was it? - Oh, two sisters collecting charity. For children orphaned by the war. - Anything wrong with that? - Well, wait. We got to get out of here, they're not real sisters. How do you know? They're stopping at an automobile parked on the corner. - We're being watched, come on. - Let me see. - No, no, stay away from that window. - Wait a minute. I follow my feelings, I feel scared inside and I'm responsible for you. - Trust my feelings. - Listen, let's not get too jumpy about this. If they're from the police, we'd be arrested already. No, I know it is something wrong, I have more experience than you have. - We must get out of here and quick. - All right Gina. Have it your way. Here we'll be safe for the night. I think this is safe, then tomorrow, as soon as it gets light, we'll move. All right. For a house that is being watched, we got out awfully easy. I trust my feelings. I'm shaking, I'm shaking all over. Now you'll go to pieces Gina. Every day you fall apart a little more. Too long too much. Too much worry and too much fright. And too much death. Gina, you're going to be all right, don't worry. I want you to like me. I want you to be jealous over me. I want you to think I'm a girl in a white dress... who is never been kissed before. It's in, the advertisement. - Where? - Here. Lieutenant Renaldo Amadi. They got Polda's daughter out. Now we must go to Romoli's. - Nightmare is over baby. - And another one starts to get Polda out. - We'll manage, did you get me a razor? - Yes. Razor and a blade... and a piece of soap. Thanks. You're welcome. Al, in our work you meet a man or a woman... for a day or a week, then goodbye. But in one day a heart comes close. Maybe in peacetime I don't even look at you... say, silly American tourist. But now I tell you, I like very much this long American... - I want you to know. - Why only like Gina? - It's better, easier. - Why? Sometimes it's better. You must shave and hurry. We got to go to Romoli's. Give me your coat, take this. Get into that doorway. Gina, get Polda. Look, it's just like killing a mad dog. Except for the dog you can feel sorry, it's not his fault he is sick. E morto? Dr. Jesper. - Dr. Jesper. - Yes? I think you'd better drive. Oh, it's nothing serious. Just a little too much excitement at my age. I'll be again all right as soon as I've seen Maria. All right, stop around the bend. Jesper. That's the first time I heard your name. Jesper, I like it. Thank you. Lieutenant Pinkie at your service. - Pinkie. - Come on in folks. It's Ok, it's Pinkie. - Hi Al. - Pinkie. - Meet professor Polda. - How do you do professor Polda? - How do you do? - Where you get that stuff? Oh, this? My traveling costume. Kind of a nice fit, isn't it? Oh, meet Pinaro. Great old guy, if he were in uniform he'd have a chest full of fruit salad. - Pinaro, I nostri amici. - Benvenuti. - Ci acomodati. - Let's go in. - And, this is Pietro. - Buona sera Pietro. - Where's Marsoli? - He'll be along any minute. And with Signorina Polda. - Is she safe? - Perfectly safe. And very happy she's going to see you again. - Run into any trouble? - Not a hitch in the whole operation. Went like a breeze, we worked it through a little girl in the hotel. Nice kid, a little scared at first, but I, I appealed to her better nature. Grazie. Our Perugian friends fixed up some papers that made it Ok to travel by train. Thank you. This afternoon we got off at the nearest town. I figured the others would make it easier here after dark. So I came on ahead and checked on our reservations for the trip out. - Oh, Pinaro... - Where do we meet the plane? In a field about four miles from here. - Grazie. - Gina knows where. - Can I go all the way by car? - Almost, won't take long. Ti chiamano. It's from Corsica, the plane will land at 4 o'clock A. M. What sort of plane will they send? How big? They know there are four of us going out. I know I should be wishing they come quickly and it all be over... but all I can think of is... in one hour we'll say goodbye. Gina, there's room on the plane. There's so few of us here, even one who runs away is badly missed. You know that, don't you? - Yes. - I know that. Signorina Polda. Aspetta. - Ora ver? suo padre. - Grazie, non vedo I'hora.. Benvenuti, entrare. - Come Va Pinkie? - Bene Bene. Signori e Signora, la Signorina Polda. But that's... that's not Maria. - What? - That is not Maria. - Where is she? Where is my daughter? - In the Perugia cemetery. She died six months ago. No. No, that's impossible. She's been writing me steadily. The handwriting is so hard to imitate. Tedeschi. It is no use, you're surrounded by Germans. Throw away your guns and march out with your hands up. Surrender. It's your only chance. Get down. Looks like they're going to take their time about it. They can afford to. Probably have a whole Kraut regiment out there by daylight. Al, sometimes one guy carries the ball, sometimes another. There's a way out of here through the cellar. - Grab the old man and Gina and beat it. - I can't do it pinkie. Don't go soft on me now, there isn't time. It'll be light in an hour, and that plane can't wait. Why don't we all try it together? Because the only way you can make is if we do enough... shooting to convince them we're all still here. - Now get going. - No Pinkie. My orders were to get you into this country and get you out. For the love of heavens, don't go soft on me at a time like this. Gina, get him out through the trapdoor. That's an order, for you too Al. Light out. - Jesper. - Eh? Gina. And I can only give them five more minutes. Aspetti 10 minuti, estando per arribare. There they come. Gina. - Gina girl, after the war. - Who knows what will be then? - I'm coming back. - Things change. - People change. - I'm coming back for you Gina. Who knows? Don't you want me to? If you don't, say so. - Say it now. - Want? Want? More than living. Come back, come back for me. Goodbye, my darling. I'll be back.
