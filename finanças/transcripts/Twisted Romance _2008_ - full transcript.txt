He's always around. - Sure. - So... maybe you know him. - Yes. I'm sure I've seen him. We could come by for dinner some time. - Sure. Any time. No problem. - All right. I'll tell him. Well what do we have here? How long have you been here? Since 3 this afternoon. Is it okay if I take a shower? Go ahead. Go ahead and do what you want. - Slow down. Slow down. - Talk, talk. - Take off your clothes. - There's no need. - Can't you go a little slower? - I'm going slow enough. Just do as I say. Do as I say. What is it? What? What is it, dude? Hey... Didn't you get off? Isn't it your turn to be passive? Nah! Cut it out, bro. What's your deal? Okay... but I like it, too. I need it. I like it both ways. - I don't know... - Give it up. I already got off. Give it up. I'm gonna stick it in you. Later on. Do you think it's that easy? Do you think I give my ass to whoever wants it? Nobody's ever touched my ass. Give me time. Give me time. I mean it. How much time? It's not like... I'm changing my mind in a minute. No way. But I promise that I'll think about it. What am I supposed to do in the mean time? You were about to take a shower. Take it! So? How did you sleep? Good, good... very good. Where do you live? In... In fact... I usually spend the afternoon hanging at some friends' place not far from here. At night, I wander through the neighborhood streets. Some nights, I go to a bar. The thing is... the streets at night are pretty fucked up. - Yup. - These days you can't trust anybody. On one side, there's the police, on the other, the punks. Wandering around like that, you're pretty exposed. Okay, look... as long as you don't cause me any problems... as long as you don't spring any surprises on me... I really don't like surprises... You can stay here tonight because I won't be back until tomorrow. Great. Yeah. - You know your way around kitchen? - Yeah. It's all good. There's food in the fridge. I've gotta go... so I'll see you tomorrow. And... sure... fix something for me because I'll be hungry too... huh? Ciao. Thanks a lot. What is it? What do you want? - I've come to see my daughter. - Why didn't you call first? - Do I need your permission? - Yes, you do. - Why? - 'cause I'm the macho around here, dude. Call her out. We have to get a few things settled before I call her. What do we need to settle? First of all. I talked to my woman and she told me that when I'm around, you treat her like a lady, but when you're alone with her you treat her like a whore. And I guess you think I'll change because that's what you want. You'd better, man. I am who I am. And you'd better stay out of our business. I won't stay out of it, because I'm feeding your child. so from now on, I give the orders. I'm the one in charge. Are we clear? What are you doing? Why don't you call before coming? Why do I have to call? Because this is my house and my neighborhood, your face annoys me. Come out and we'll work it out in the street. Let me see my daughter. Want to work it out? Then where are you going? Come out here, so we have space to work this out. Come on out here faggot. You step 30 meters away from the house and then I'll call her. - Call my daughter and shut the fuck up. - Get 30 meters back and I'll call her. Go and call her now. I told you to step back. I won't call her otherwise. Get me a ruler so I can measure. Is that what you want, motherfucker? - No way I'll call her with you cursing. - Fucking call her, cocksucker. - You pussy boy. - Who's the fag here? The fag around here is you. That's your reputation. Where do you want me fucker? I just came to talk to the kid. Okay. But we need to talk about the child support. Sure. But some other time. Today I just came talking to her. - Fine, but don't forget it. - No, I won't forget. - Where's the coat I gave you? - Mommy kept it. What did you want to talk about? I want to tell you... that no matter what... people say about dad, no matter what... whenever you need something from me, just ask, okay? Hello? ...No, he's not here. Who is this? ...Hello? ...Hello? It's bizarre... This glass... it's too much. It's incredible. Every time you drink and put it down, it forms some kind of vacuum inside and... ...Bloop! It splatters your face! - You're pulling my leg. - I swear, try it. - lt's true. - See? It's really funny. - Drink and wash your face at once. - Right... Sometimes we get by by doing oddjobs. We've got many skills in the... spiritual area. And so... we read runes, tarot, and the Itchy... - Don't you mean I-Ching? - Of course! That's right. - That's interesting stuff, - Yes, yes! Very interesting. So many people are filled with so many doubts so many anxieties... crushed by their problems. And maybe you can solve them or whatever... or warn them about something that's going to happen. Nice, huh? She'll ask you lots of questions to try to figure you out. Why's she gotta ask anyway? If she knows so much, she should be able to guess. Everthing about your past, your present or whatever has yet happen to you. It's interesting that so many people would need that kind of service. What do you do for a living? I don't have a particular occupation. I do a variety things. I've never liked 9 to 5 jobs, and all of that structure. Right. My life's got to be dynamic or else I'd get bored and give up. It's not just about making money. But, you know, when you fall into the routine every possibility of happiness goes to hell. I'm careful these days about what I take on. Live and learn. And it's never been very easy for me to open up and share intimate details. Roberto looks really good. He seems so happy. Yes, I'm also happy that you're better. Much happier since he's seeing you. He's had so many partners... - Shush. - Friends. - More upbeat. - Yeah. And so much more collected. Fine. But, look, I don't want you talking all about my life, neither... about everything that's happened nor everthing that hasn't. Dinner was delicious, senora. I really enjoyed it. Thank you. You're very kind. - You mind if I smoke? - No, no. Please, go ahead. Grab him the ashtray, mom. It's over there. - Got one to spare for me? - Hey, when did you start smoking? Since about a week ago. We didn't realize you were taking him down the path to vice. I thought he already smoked. I offered him one and he said yes. He didn't say it was his first time smoking. I don't enjoy leading people to do things that aren't right. Each of us must be responsible our own acts and respect those of others. I take responsibility for myself at least. Sure. So what else do you do to get by? We work in this bar, nearby. - At "The Dawn"? - Yeah, it's called "The Dawn". We do table service. Cool. Some day we should go together and have lunch there. Yes, but we have the morning shift. I can make you the breakfast special. - No way! - No, no... really! Well, we'd arrive by afternoon and the four of us could have lunch. - That'd be nice. - Sure, yeah. Look Raul. I made this one myself. There's no serial number for ballistics... I don't know. This could be... just the right solution for your problems, don't you think? You step right up to that cocksucker, and point this at his head... Who's gonna miss that faggot? Thanks dude, but... if only it were that easy. But the thing is, if I kill the guy, my wife would be here with the cops two minutes later. And I'd never see my daughter again. And if I beat the crap out of him, he gets better and keeps my kid. He's afraid of me. But he's got my kid, so he's got me trapped. The whole thing... really gets me down. Look Raul, I didn't know if I should even tell you,.. but I happened to see Silvia selling the clothes that you got for your kid, She was peddling bags full of them through the barrio from house to house. She has no shame. Nothing that woman does surprises me. That's what has got me so tired that I want to end it all. I want to go back over what we were talking about the other day... about living together and the best way to handle it. Wouldn't it be a good idea if... I mean... better if each of us slept in his own room? There's a little room here. You could fix it up however you like. Make yourself comfortable. All right. I wanted to tell you that... I thought that maybe things would change. What I mean is... I'm not a total bottom... and it seems to me, that I should have more than what I'm getting. You must know I can't just decide something like that on the spot. It's nothing minor. I don't know, I can't promise you anything. I can't make a mistake on this matter at my age. Anyway, we'll see. You must give me time. Besides all that, whenever we get together to fuck, you get way too violent. And the truth is I don't get off at all. Well, it's a good thing you've told me, because as far I could know, it seemed like you did get off. But this we can change. No problem. We'll see. This seems to me like... like a good start. I just want to be clear about this... about the separate beds. - All right. - Don't get me wrong but... What do you think about it? Hello? No, he's not here. Who is this? Hello? Speak up you idiot! Well hello. - Can I have a PC? - Sure, take number 6. Thanks. Enter Chat Spaniard in Buenos Aires - Hi. - Hi. How are you? - Kinda horny and alone. U? - Same. - Travel 2 the burbs? - Where? Should we get a room? There's a place nearby, but it's kind of pricey. No problem. For me, nothing's very expensive around here. He definitely said he was coming. Maybe he wasn't allowed to. That's news! Now he has to ask permission to visit his family? That's the way some machos are. I've had a great time. Is that, "I did too"...? - Or is it, "could'a been better"? - I did, too. - I did, too? - Yeah... I did, too. Good! First quarter... and first score. Are we going to see each other again? I'm seeing someone. That's fine. I'm... not. I'm just passing through... I mean... I'm not asking you to marry me or anything like that. But I'd like to see you again... and have a good time. Maybe not here... it's a joke. If he finds out... I don't think he'd like it very much. That's fine... but... it's up to you whether you go home and tell him... about all your hookups. It can be our secret. - Sure. - Deal? Why not? You don't put up too much of a fight, huh? That's great. - All right. - Gotta go? - Gotta. - Ok. - It was a pleasure. - Adios. In Spain, we do two. - Keep in touch. - See you. Right. - Okay? - Sure. - Don't be a stranger. - I won't. - Ciao. - Ciao. - Cut it out, crazy. - Hey! What are you doing? Sleeping? - I want to penetrate you. - No. Some other time. Don't you understand? I'm telling you I'm tired. This situation is getting ugly. Didn't we talk about this? Kid, I'm a grown man! A grown up, yeah... but a man who has grown bitter. No, no dude. We've already talked about this. Give me time. I've already given you time. A little more... a bit more time. - You old faker. - I'm not deceiving you at all. Yes, you are dude. You're fucking with me. Know what? Know what's gonna happen? You'll never give your ass up to me. Because it takes a man to give your ass up. - And you're just a chicken shit. - Come on, let's talk. You better do something or this ends here. - Come on Roberto. - What's up? Huh? Let's talk. No, man, we've already talked about this. Can't you even try to understand that it won't easy for me to take it up my ass. Why have I even wasted my time on your old ass? What am I supposed to do? - Spend my life jerking off? - No, man. Cut it out. Man, you're a dick. Go fuck yourself. - Stop a minute. - Give me that filthy ass now. My ass is mine. Hey there... Raul? ...are you up there? Raul... Raul? - What are you looking for? - For you. I really wonder... why should this you bother you so? What harm is there in my visiting you? We're family now, aren't we? If you've come looking for your brother, I don't know where he is. No, I know that. I'm not looking for him. The thing is... I've got a little secrete I've kept it to myself, but I can't hide it any longer in my soul. Do you need some kind of help? Something like that. The fact is that... that well.. I.... From the first moment I saw you with my brother I thought... what a sexy and virile guy, what a beautiful man. And... well... you've always turned me on. My mother thought us to share everything, That's the philosophy for live we follow, you know? When someone's good in bed, my brother and I aren't selfish assholes. Cut it out. We shared some truly beautiful moments. My mom's always told me that we have to be free. Being free means being happy and surrendering the body to the soul. It means sharing everything, everything. Emptying the head of all its worries. By sharing what we have, we forget about wars, all the problems drugs introduce. Just being happy, loving each other. No, no, no, no. This is too much. You're a lying flirt. I don't believe a word you say. Your visit is over. - Why don't you believe me? - Go home to your Momma. I don't want to go home to my Mom. What do you mean you don't want to! Get the hell out of here, you cunt! Like it a little rough, do you? So do I. - Do you? - Sure, I do. - So you ain't going home, right? - Right. Then you're coming with me and I'll show you rough. - No! No! - Oh, yes, you're coming with me bitch. Let me go... Didn't we agree I should call you? Yes, and you never did. Well, you gave me no time. How did you find the place? Let's say I have my resources. Your love nest is all right. Very green. Yeah. The problem is if Raul came by now, he wouldn't like it at all. - Ah, so his name is Raul. - Yeah. What's he like? Is he your age? I'm not telling you. I like him. That's good. That's the most important. I like being here... having a place to stay. And don't you ever dream of trying out other places, other things... getting to know other people? Not right now. I'm comfortable now. I live with someone. I'll make you a proposal. I only have three days left in Argentina. Let's mess around. See what happens. Anyway after that I'll leave and you'll stay here, with your life and your super prince. That's it. What do you say? We don't have much time, anyway. It was nice dinner at my mother's, wasn't it? I think they really liked you. My Mom said that we could go again next weekend if we arrange it. I think one of these days, I'll ask them to come and see the house. - Hi, what's up? - Hi. - Smurf sent me. - Smurf! How's that bastard doing? - He's away on a trip. ...Yeah. - Is he? - Where is he? - He's in Uruguay. - Uruguay? - Yes. And what do you need? He told me you sell pieces. Is that right? And... what are you looking for? - I need a 9. - A 9? I need to flip a jerk. That flipping will be a little expensive. You know what it costs? Sure I do. I have the money. If you want it, I'll get it for you and you can come by in three hours to pick it up. What do you mean 'get it'? Don't you have it here? No, I don't. I have others, but that one I'll need to go get. - Could I go with you? - Not a chance, man. You know the way things are in this business, and how to behave. I don't know, if I give you the money... and you go get it... This is my way, if you can get it some place else, go ahead. But a 9 is not so easy to get. They won't give it to me and get the money later. The money has to be up front. - Right, then I pay you now, ok? - Great. It's all here. Three hours, right kid? - Ok. See you. - See you. Go change kid, we're going shopping. - Raul! - Surprise! - What are you doing here? - Mommy... - ...you okay? - Fine, fine. I wanted so much to see you! How are you? It's been so long. I love you so much... This is a friend. Hi, how are you? What a nice boy! A great friend. Isn't she a babe? Look at her. If you were a little older I'd suggest you start dating. Sit down. It took us forever to get here. And it was a surprise for me too, because I didn't know I was coming. - So why have you come? - We had to come for a job. - After so long. - That happens. How long has it been since last time? Is it ten months? Are we on time? Did you already cook something? No way, I didn't cook anything yet. Then let's compromise. Are you going to cook for me? Sure, as you like it. You cook a hell of a pot roast. We'll go buy some meat, because we already got some stuff but we couldn't find a butcher's. Oh! But we have one right here; it's just on the next block. - Don Luis is still there? - Yes, yes. Yes, he is. - Ah, great. - And how is your wife? She's in Misiones now. They are at some cousins. I should have gone too, but... What are you doing? Right now I'm selling some... imports... all kinds of imported stuff. Ah, so you buy from the wholesaler and sell in the countryside? Sure, and once you've established loyal customers, you're set. As always? Yes, as always but changing the articles, because you sell in a shop and everybody wants it. And what does this boy do, does he help you? He helps me with computer stuff. He knows a lot about computers. So, now it's the computers? Sure, otherwise you just disappear. You need to be connected to the internet nowadays, and I'm so out of it! Tell me about it. I see it and run away. Look how nice she is. My mother is beautiful, isn't she? She's the best. And now you get to eat her pot roast. - Ok. I'll go buy the meat. - Go ahead, buy something. It's nice to be here, but... You should come with your family sometime. The fact is we don't want to rush in like last time, you know? We'd like to come and stay for a week or two. The kid asks about you all the time. She wants to visit you. - She must be growing up... - Oh, you have no idea. He's taking a long time, your friend. Don't you think? Yeah, yeah... well... maybe there were a lot of people. Why don't you head back? What are you doing here? Are you crazy? How did you get inside? Through the door. You are crazy, man. Get out. - I want to talk. No, no, please. Raul will be here any minute. I don't understand what you're trying to do. Roberto, listen. I'm in love with you. You've got me. You can't do this: barge into my house and tell me you're in love with me. That's not love. Get out please, or this will get complicated. - I think you are lying to me. - Please, I must ask you to leave. - It's a lie, everthing you say. - Cesar, would you please leave? You're lying about everything. This Raul, you're making it all up. Just tell me that you don't like me at least... and then I'll split... Cesar, you're out of control! Please leave, this is going to get ugly! No way. I'm not leaving without you. You want me. - Is that so or not? - I don't want anybody but Raul. I don't know what I want. Because there's no Raul. You have invented everything. Please, can you get out of my fucking house? Now it's your house? Yes, now it's my house. And you know what? You can stay. You are nothing but a brainless Spanish fucker. Don't you have anything better to do than fuck up my life? Get your ass out of here! Who the fuck is this? Are you gonna answer me? Ask him. Who are you? - Hi, I'm Cesar. - Raul. Who the fuck are you? A friend. Ah, he's a friend. That wasn't so hard to explain, was it? Make yourself comfortable. I was just passing by, but I'm going now. I just came to say hi. He's told me a lot about you and I wanted to meet you. That's all. Where are you from? Spain. But I live here in the city. So you came all the way from the city and you're leaving already? Come sit down and have dinner with us please. - No, really... I've gotta go because... - Nobody refuses my food. Please... fix something to eat. And where did you two meet? Uh... around, I don't know... It was a long ago. I... No. The plate is for the guest, I just want a knife. It's just that, we met a while ago and since I'm never around here, I thought I'd come by and say hi. Have you been here long? - I came to Argentina six months ago... - No. In my house, I mean. Your house? No. To your house... just like I told you, this is the first time I've come by. Sure... And what do you have in common? Nothing much... We just met... and... I don't know... I don't really come this way much... Since I was passing by, I thought I'd say hello. Are you around here a lot? And what do you do for a living? That's none of your business. Yeah, right. We've barely met. Don't take it hard. It's just that my life is nobody's business. Least of all yours. Well, this situation is starting to get tense, so I'd better go. - Stay. It's not tense at all. - Let him leave. You're gonna let him run off? It's all right. There you are. Why are you making such a fuss? You, mother fucker! I told you not to bring anyone into my house. You don't care of what I say. Show me some respect, you shit! If we're going to talk, there's no need to raise our voices... How's that? No raised voices... -Calm down. - Shit! Fucking animal! Raul cut it out! What do you care? Come here. - Let go of me. Let me go. - Come on, buddy. Raul? Please? Raul! Open up! Raul! Raul! Raul... - Raul! Open up! - So, you're here for the first time? - Open up! - Have some of this! Mind telling me why you fucked me over? Do you think I deserve this? I don't know if you understand that what we talked the other day about sex That's not what this is about. That's not what really matters to me. If that's not it, what then? It bothers me that I don't know anything about you... or what you do with your life. I wonder where are you all day long. Some nights you don't even come home. People call and when I answer, they hang up. Are you sure you wanna know? - Yes. - Fine. Well, then, let's share. You come take a walk with me and I'll show you everything I do. On one condition. What just happened with this Spanish piece of shit is never spoken about again and is forgotten forever. You got it? Okay. Forever. - Bro! Hey... - So dude? Wasap? - How are you? - Fine, fine. This is a friend of mine. - Hey dude. - Wasap? - Let's do it inside. - Yeah, not so cold. - Cold out here? - Excuse me. - Come in, bro. Step into the office. This piece is great. Let's see if it's what you were looking for. It's 300, dude. And how about this one? Were you shooting? I have to check the magazines. This one's 200, It's a train. This piece is sluggish. What about it? If you're accurate, you shoot anyway. Just like my sister: Looser and looser. And this one? I can't go a cent lower than 500. - 500? - Check it out. - 7, 8 and 3, 10? - Oh, sure. - You're nuts! I gotta rob a bank. - Take it or leave it. - Okay? - 600. You like those two? 500 flat. 500? 400. - 400 and I'll buy you a beer. - No. It's worth 500, nothing less. But since I'm already here, 450. 450? 430 and I'll buy you a beer. - Just beer? I could use something else. - Ok. We'll have a smoke. - There you go. - Man to man. You won't regret it. It's a hell of a piece. Yeah. Looks nice. - Your bathroom? - Gotta piss? Go through here. It's around there. - Ok. - Take a piss over there. Think it over man. Look it over carefully. Yeah, we'll see... How about this one? Does it kill? - I don't know. - Don't know? If it doesn't kill, we're all in deep shit, me, you, that one...all of us. It's gotta kill. - Why me? - Cause you're with him. I've got nothing to do with this. How so? He introduced you as a friend/ Or did you meet him around the corner? No, but... I don't have anything to do with guns. But you're coming with him. If you go someplace without knowing, and he's your friend, you've got to know. What do I know? If I introduce you as a friend, I have to count on you. Right, but I don't have anything to do with guns. He introduced you as a friend. Told you! Ain't got anything to do with guns! So, wasap? What are you talking about? What's going on? This one here's no friend of yours. He doesn't know if it shoots or not. - What did you say? - Nothing. There are things you shouldn't talk about. Are you making friends? And why do you ask him? He doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, and doesn't shoot. He's gotta know. You deal with me and that's it. We're grown up. You'd better come alone, buddy. Who cares if he smokes or not, if he drinks or not? Can't you see he's a kid. Wake up, man. You don't listen to what I say. Sorry. But I can talk to whoever I want to. You have to obey me. Stop fucking around. What do you mean, obey you? You'll do as I say, that's why you're here with me. What the fuck? Obey you? Fucking prick. Eunuch. Might as well be a fucking eunuch. - I'm out of here. - You leaving, dude? The young are lost, man. No two ways about it. Hey kid, what's up? You don't listen to me, you get angry and leave. I'm tired of being treated like shit. I ain't your son, you asshole. You can't decide where I go, who I talk to, who I hang with, what I say, what I think. Who the fuck do you think you are? So what are we doing? Stop fucking with me or you'll never see me again. It's as simple as that. Listen, I know I have a shitty personality, and with the Spaniard I lost it... I don't know. I've also faced some hard times in my life. I got married very young.. to someone who... mistreated me. He liked to get drunk and beat me. He'd carry on with his lovers... ...right under my nose. And I put up with all that just for them. But then mistreatment touched them, too. Then, well... I had had enough. I kicked him out. I made up my mind... and threw him out. Let's go. Boss! Hey! Hey, boss! Come here! We need to talk. Wanna talk? Come on in. - Ey dude, what happed to my piece? - It's gone, man. - How do you mean it's gone? - They fucked me over. - The money I gave you? - I'm telling you. They screwed me. - No way. - We both lose. It'll be good next time. You know these things happen. - I'm not infallible. Shit happens. - I think you're fucking with me. No, I'm not. What do you think you're doing prick? Coming to my place to fuck around? - No, I'm not... - Get out. Go to hell, prick. Oh! Son of a bitch! Roberto... you okay? Get the hell out, prick. Get the hell out. I'll be back to get you with the guys. Sure, I'll be waiting. Get the hell out. - I'll burn you. Don't forget it. - Fuck off, motherfucker! Roberto... Good afternoon. - How are you? - Fine. Hey, girl... Okay. What are you doing here? I'm looking for Roberto. What? Isn't he with you? At the moment, no. Did you screw up? What could I have possibly done that you hadn't done before? Well, if you don't like my son, find yourself a woman. - I guess you've found a man? - I sure did. Very good. What about you, baby girl? You gonna tell me where your little brother is? I need to see him. It's rather urgent. If you'll tell me where he is, you'd be doing me a favour. Have you asked his friends? Shut up, Mom. I don't know all of his friends, senora. What about Miguel and Sergio? Stop it, Mom. Hurry up, we've got to go. Shall we leave together? No/ Bad idea. Ciao. I honestly don't get you. Hey! Is Roberto here? - Are you Raul? - Yeah. Come in. So? Can you call him? Yes, I'll bring him right out. Listen, the kid told me you beat him. That you misbehave, act crazy? What about it? Chill out. It's nothing. The fact is... we had an... an argument... and that's why I'm here, because... I know I was wrong and I want to talk to him. Just keep in mind you're in my house. Don't give me any trouble or fusses. It's peaceful here. If there's any trouble, I'll find you and fix it. Really, don't you worry That won't be necessary. It's all right. We'll just talk a while. Please call him. Fine. All this stays between you and me, huh? That's fine. Go ahead. Raul's here. He says he wants to talk to you. What about? He says he wants to fix things. He seems sincere. How are you kid? - What do you want? - I came to talk. Fine. Let's talk. Not here. Let's go home. - No. Here. - Why here? - Why at your place? - Because we're alone at home. It's our problem, why should we spread it among strangers? These strangers are my friends. Let's find a solution. I know I fucked up, but I have lots of shit going on right now. You'd better deal with it then, man. You don't know me. You don't know me at all. Let's go to your place if you want, Let's go and talk. But watch yourself. Come on, calm down. Everything will work out. I'll go get my stuff and come. Everything will work out. I'm going with him. - Ok, see you. - Ciao. - Take care of yourself. Ciao. - Bye, people. - Call if you need anything. - Sure. - Remember what we talked about. - Don't worry, pal. You fucking asshole. What's gotten into you... hiding out with those fags'? If you think I'm afraid of them, you're a fucking idiot. Where you think you're going? You're staying right here to hear me out. Know what's gonna happen if you go? Know what's gonna happen over there? Nothing's gonna happen to you because you still turn me on. But as for your mother, I'll send over some of my friends. So when she's on the floor, with a couple of broken ribs and her face like a balloon, I'm gonna ask her if she knows what an idiot she was to mess with me. You'll be responsible for anything that happens to her. Wanna leave? Go ahead. Don't have the guts, huh? Get inside, asshole. On the floor! Down on the floor! - Who else is here? - No one. Shut the fuck up! Fry him! Hello... Yeah. Ciao. What happened? - Nothing. - What do you mean nothing, Roberto? - What happened? - Tell us. The guy I'm with is a piece of shit after all. I can't believe it. I thought things would be different this time. What did he do to you? I don't know... he beat me. He hurts me. He's so violent. He's full of aggression. Nothing matters to him, not even his family, or the guy he's with, either. He doesn't even care about his daughter. Why didn't you tell us before? - Because I'm afraid of him. - Afraid of what? He told me that if I don't follow his rules, he's gonna hurt you. Ah! Very nice! You have many problems. And you don't get to solve them. Exactly. Give me a second, please. Just a moment. Please... Don't say a word. Just focus on your faith. Mr... ...Mr. Lopez? Yes. I know why you can't resolve anything. There is a spirit cursing your family. - Do you understand me? - Yes. A spirit is cursing your family... - Hey... - Fucked up motherfucker. - What's up? - Think I'm an idiot? Don't think I know what you did? Your thugs attacked my friends. You wanted to get back to me and attacked my friends. - Which friends? - Don't fool with me. I'm not fool. How can you accuse me of something I know nothing about? - Fine. Keep it up. - How can you accuse me this way, bro? Where's your proof? You're fucking crazy. God damn! What the hell? I'm minding my business and you barge in busting my balls. Where's your proof? I can't live this way. Do you hear me? You screwed up. You hurt me. So? Aren't you coming in? Come on! Coming... I'm coming... Hi! - Hi! - Hi. Come right in. Please, make yourselves comfortable. Mom will be right out. What's the matter with this bitch? She's laughing at me. I have no idea. I can't ask her: "Alejandra, why are you laughing at Raul?" Don't be so paranoid. And you tell me you've changed. I'm telling you one thing: I'll eat then I split. Got it? Well, well... - -Good evening. - Hi, Mom. What a dish! Nice and pretty. Oops! Sorry. So... tell me, Raul? How are things going? Fine. Everything's fine. Oh...! Nothing's ever fine. But that's the customary response, isn't it? I have something to tell you... I hope you won't take it hard, But you know, you can trust me. Open up to me and let it all out. I bumped into your ex-wife, No, no! I know her... her brain never worked very well. She's kind of wacked, but... Alejandra, you have no right getting into that. No, I mean... I've got no problem with her, but she treated me really bad. I was vey nice to her, like the queen she is, and she got so nervous! Is she in trouble? I could help if you want? Why don't you tell me everything... Stop it, Alejandra. I'm speaking from my heart. - I mean, I have a special gift for this. - It's over, Alejandra. - Change the subject. - Oh, no! I was being cool. So... trying to get any work? - Always something or other. - Sure! What a profession! Always something or other. Alejandra! Please shut up. What's wrong? Tell me something. Are you a cop or my bitch? What? I'm asking are you a cop or my bitch? If neither of the above, I'm not telling you shit about my life. Oh! You've got such crazy ideas! Your bitch? Please! Come on. Guys get such ideas! Now, I must admit that there was a moment when I thought... hmm... "that's some piece my brother is enjoying!" Alejandra! Alejandra, cut the crap... No, really! The fact is... a real man like you... you don't meet one every day, huh? Nor bitches like you. No, sure. But don't worry... I'm not going to bed with you. I've already got a boyfriend. - Is it so? - Yes. - Got a boyfriend? - Yes. That's good. You're lucky to be alive. Yeah... If you were my girlfriend, I'd have killed you already. Ohhh, you scare me so much... All right, all right. Let's have a toast! - Why not? - A toast? To what? To family... - To love... - Dumb love! Come on, let's drink to family. - Cheers. - Cheers. - To dumb love! You have to look one another right in the eyes or it's bad luck. Hey, Alejandra! Enough, Raul. Stop it. Let's go home. It's late. - Slow down, man. Slow down. - Come on, it's late. Fuck the time. You brought me here to fuck me over so I'm gonna have a fuck. I'll stay a little longer and I'll fuck your sister. She's hot and she's also hot for me. - Hey... Alejandra? - Enough, Raul. Let's go. Alejandra...come here. Come and pet my little boy a bit. Come here, you little slut. Alejandra, come here! Come over here, little slut. You know you're horny for me. We'll have some fun. We'll fuck all night long. Come here. - Shut up, you sick bastard! - What's it to you? Show some hospitality. I've got some for you too if you want. Do you wanna fuck? Great, we'll all party together. Enough! Stop, Alejandra! Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! subtitles: depositio
