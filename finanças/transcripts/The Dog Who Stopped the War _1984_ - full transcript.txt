Shhhh! Go to sleep. So, for my "favorite possession" assignment, I brought this because it's so pretty. The end. Stefan, come on! Give it right back! Forget it... know what this is worth? Almost 100 bucks! Hey Luc, come on, one teensy peep Luc! ... my favorite possession is this trophy... come on... ... I won it by swimming 25 meters, 3rd fastest in my whole swim class... Bet you a whole buck I know what's in there! ... next summer when I go to swim class, I'm going to win an even bigger one! Um, thank you, that's all! François, you're next. This ... was easy, My favorite possession is my box of drafting tools. It's a real professional one, just like the architects use... Pierre! Pierre! ... this is a compass, and the way you use it is... you put in a sharpened pencil lead and you push it around and it draws a circle. On this one, both points are metal and it's used to measure how big... Thank you, François. I'm not finished! Oh, it's not that it isn't good, but we're almost out of time today, sorry! We're down to you Luc, and step lively. You'll have to hurry to get your turn before the bell rings. What's that? - What is that thing? It's a trumpet. - It's a hunter's horn! Oh no it's not! It's an old army bugle. Well, bugle or horn, if you play it, we'll go deaf! Can you play it? - A little bit. Hit it Napoleon! Well, merry Christmas, people! Have a super vacation and I'll see you next year! Attack right! Attack left! Cleo! Attack front! Cleo! Mission accomplished, General. You, a general? - I sure am, I just don't have an army yet. Hey, we can make an army and hold a war game during the holidays! It would be the first war ever without two armies. We'd be able to get two armies if everyone got together! What do you think? - Well, maybe. Hey, you guys, come and get me! A fort! We're under attack! Take no prisoners! You call this a fort? Victory! The fort has fallen! Hey, leave those kids alone you big bullies! Get out of there, and don't dawdle! And Martin, stop crying, you're not a baby! We were just fooling around, Mrs. Sirois. See, Martin, your fort is as good as new, right? That's on backwards! Picky little runt! Yahoo! Mommy! Well, Pierre, looks like your new neighbors are moving in! Hey, you've got a nice truck. A ride home would be cool. Buy a kiddie car! Hey, you better watch what you say. He happens to be a general. Oh,... and he's brave. When he's up against little kids. Looks as if you've met your match, Luc! How about this war... are you for it or not? There's nothing to win. What's the point? We could give bounty! - What's bounty? Bounty is what you get in a war. We could make a bounty chest if we all contributed. Hey, that sounds pretty good! - How about it, are you two going to play? Come on, please, you can't miss a good war! - Okay, where do we meet? At the barn, naturally. At 2 o'clock. Okay by me. - See you there! Don't forget to bring some bounty! - We won't. Two o'clock? - Yes, two o'clock. - Okay! Two o'clock for them! You like your little car, eh? It rolls you know. Try it! That smells good! Cleo. Cleo! Leave Bobby alone! Will you get away from there? Cleo, that's enough! Pierre, something has to be done. She's impossible! I can't cope when she keeps ignoring me. She won't do it again, Mom, I promise. Pierre? - I'll be right there. See you. See you, Bobby. Coming, Cleo? Come on, Chabot. Stand back. Give me some room. I bet you a buck it's frozen into the ice. - What ice? It's in a pit! Okay, lift. - Watch your fingers! Look out, this thing's heavy! - Easy now, take it easy! The sack's still in there! - It's still in there! It's not frozen at all. I told you! It's exactly the way we left it. Of course it is. Why do you think we use this barn as a secret hiding place, huh? That's right, you dopey. - Way to go. I can't wait to see mine! Hey wait, that one's mine! - Mine's broken. Hey, mine's in great shape! - Alright! Okay, gather around. Time to draw up the rules of war. Oh, yours is a lot nicer than mine! Fetch it! Okay, that's it. You're almost there. Eat it, go on. Don't bobble it around. Okay, here. There's another one. Good. Good boy. Dig in! They're good, huh? You know what I did? - What? I took a roll of toilet paper, and you know we sleep in bunks, right? - Cleo, come on! After he went to sleep one night, I took out the toilet paper... The army that claims victory... - Hey, somebody is already here! Sounds like everybody's already here! - ... gets the spoils. Spoils? What spoils? ... thus end the official rules. Hey, Cleo. Look who's here. Over here, girl. - Hey, how come you came so late? How come you guys came so early? Uh... maybe I got the time wrong? - Don't play innocent, you planned this! I suppose everything is already decided. - Who dictated the rules, should I read it again, Luc? Yea! - Hey, you were supposed to put in my ideas. How come you didn't? Watch it, Four-eyes, just watch it! First Rule of War: We will split up into two armies who've got to stay enemies all the time. So that means any member of an army caught speaking to an enemy is a traitor! You can't mean it! - Only insults and personal remarks are allowed! Aren't you pushing it a little? No, they do the same in hockey. Nobody speaks to the other team. They even put it in professional contracts. Second Rule of War: Hostilities shall begin at 2 today and be terminated on the opening of school. Good. The war is more important than school. I'm serious! Third Rule of War: Hostilities terminate each day after dark and resume at sunup every morning. Do we get a lunch break? - What a dodo! - Well, he's right! Fourth Rule of War: Hostilities must not endanger any civilians, so the town is out of bounds. Got to stick to the woods and fields. - Shut up, Jean! - Let me finish! Little motormouth! Fifth Rule of War: The war will be fought with shields, wooden swords and snowballs. ... and the Sixth Rule of War: Everyone has to bring a donation to be put in the bounty chest. The army that claims victory, claims the chest as its spoils. If some people keep putting sandwiches in, I don't want to win! Right, Chabot, in two weeks those things will probably kill somebody! If you don't want them, I'll eat them. Hey, guys, why don't we build snow castles! I'll draw the plans... or huge forts with big towers... It's a war we're holding, Four-eyes, not a winter carnival! Did you bring your donation for the bounty chest? - Well, I did. Luc's so bossy! He has to decide everything! Okay, Pierre and me will divide us into armies. See, there he goes again. Top hand picks first. No, let them pick us. Nice throw, Hawkeye! We'll get the more guys for sure now. - We'd better! He's not going to have enough to make an army. It might be a lot smarter just to pick teams, you know? In a real war, you pick your leader, so we should do it the same way. Okay, all those joining me come over here. Where are you going? Who are you going to pick? - I don't know. This is hard. Why couldn't we just pick teams? Hey, this way I can't speak to my brother, right? Yeah, that's right. Not even at home? - Nope. Sorry, my family comes first. - That's great, got any more brilliant ideas? We're the larger force, so we'll attack. Hey, we forgot something important. Suppose we fight, but no one surrenders? Oh yeah. How about doing this then: Let Four-eyes have a ball and make his fort. Then we'll attack it, and the army in the fort on the last day of vacation wins the chest. Now the barn's our headquarters, okay? Hey, you can't do that. You know this barn's for us all. Sorry, me and my army took it over. Going to be like that about it? Then forget it. You can't bully us! Hey wait, you can't quit, come on! Have a nice war, guys! You're just mad because more guys picked my side! You can't give up without a battle. - Yeah, no fair! You've got 3 seconds to get out of my army's barn, you hear? We're going because we want to, not because of you! You'll end up fighting this war! - We'll never play! Oh yes you will! That's the last time I have anything to do with that jerk! Hey you guys, you know what? We could still build a fort. Let's get them! - Attack! Okay, man, that's enough. They got the message. ... Sissies - Quitters! Don't move, Cleo. Lift your paw. Now this one. Good! Stay still. You have to learn to control yourself better if you want to stay in the house. I know, you think we're ignoring you now that there's a baby around. But that doesn't mean that you have to act like a baby... just to get some attention. Hello. - Hello. What's her name? - Cleo. How old is she? - Nine, last Fall. My name is Sophie. My name is Pierre. What's that? That's my invention. Want to see it work? I made another harness, out of rope, but I think it's... Pierre! Look Pierre. I finished it last night... Later, okay, we're busy. - You could at least look. What's the point? - What is it? The plans for the fort. What are you doing here? I want to build a fort with you guys. Go play with kids your own age! - But why not? Go on, I said! It looks complicated. - It's not, I'll show you! Look, Pierre. It's a work of art! Pierre, come on, look. It won't take a minute. I guarantee you've never seen anything like this! Did you do this all yourself? - Of course, I'm very bright you know. Pierre! - Oh, not them again! You still don't want to play, huh? Enemies can't communicate, remember? Then I'll let this do the talking! Cleo! Cleo? Cleo! Cleo, stay! I love this! - Cleo! Oh! You'll pay for this, Luc, just wait! I knew it would be like this. Luc will never give up. You're nothing but a yellow-belly, that's what you are! You and your bunch of blockheads! He just wants to make us fight. - Why don't you? There are 7 of them and 3 of us. That's why we need a fort. Sorry, I was trying to hit Pierre. Ah, those twins are hopeless! Ugh! That's my brand-new vest, you know? Look at this mess! Are you out of your mind? Come on, are you scared of a girl? Go to it men, go on! Don't move. I'll get my sister. Time! She's getting her sister. So that's your army, General, huh? They're at war. They're forbidden to hurt civilians. Did you see them run away? That's what this army needs, women! The little one's okay, but the big one had a hole in it so I had to patch... I guess the war is on, huh? Hey, are we there yet? - Almost there! ... sort of opens up a whole new world, before I just did castles, you know, cannons and iron bars... Hey, nice spot, eh? We build it here! Gonna ask me why? Come here, I'll show you. Look down there! Hey, it's the barn! - We'll be able to keep an eye on them. Look! They sent a spy already. Oh, don't worry, he's not in Luc's army. That's Ti-Guy La Lune. He doesn't hang around with anybody. Hello. Building a castle? Not a castle. A fort! - Where are you going, Ti-Guy? Nowhere special. Beautiful day, eh? I love winter! Hi Cleo, how are you doing? The snow's nice and hard. We'll be able to cut it into blocks. You're fighting a war here? - Uh huh. Oh... This is no run-of-the-mill fort here. We're building a superstar, a classic! It's going to be as big as a house, so they can't climb in. And... And, they're going to be terrified just looking at it. We're going to put towers on it, and a drawbridge, and doors and windows, and all sorts of decorations, and... and flags and all sorts of secret entrances. We'll even put in a big dining hall! Everything you can think of, we'll put it in! It'll have everything but a swimming pool! It'll be just like a castle in the Middle Ages. It's going to be a masterpiece! You just wait... I saw her here last night, and the night before. Think we should take her prisoner? That'd be great, except it's dark already. Stupid rules! How about if we sneak up and surprise her? Here she comes now! - Told you she would. Should I do something? - Yeah, take me back home. Have you just thought of a plan? - Yeah, keep quiet about this, okay? Okay. It's freezing, Dad, please? She'll get pneumonia. Alright, alright, let her in. Cleo! Cleo! But, this time, behave. Come on, girl. I hope you did your business. Oh, you scared me! Sorry, I didn't mean to. You're a good skier, you know? Sophie! Come on, there's a good war movie on! Hey, what's he doing here? And don't you let me catch you peeping on me again, you hear me? Wow! Look at that. What a beauty! That's quite a fort alright. Whoa, it's even got a door! - They're even making it easy for us! Maranda, you're sure they're in there? - Bet you a whole buck they're in there! Let's go, but quietly. They're on their way! - We're ready! Get down, Sophie! Watch this! Ouch, I'm on your side, stupid! Storm the main gate! Look out, it's a trap! - Quick, put up the ladder! Come on, the ladder, you guys! - Pick your end up. Get up the ladder! Okay, hold the bottom! Luc's climbing up! Quick, Jean-Louis! - I'm coming! Hey, hey, Jean-Louis, don't! Hey, come on, help me! Luc, get down, get down! - I can't. Hold on. Don't let go! Are you okay, Luc? What do we do now? Retreat, you idiot! Are you alright, Luc? - Want to come and try again, Luc? I told you he was a pushover! We'll get you next time, that's for sure! - That's right! - You'll pay for this! Bet you a buck we'll get you next time! - Bye, it was nice seeing you! They've got no right to use girls in their army! - In war anything goes, so quit whining! The war, the war, it's no reason to hurt each other! You got me pretty good today. - You were almost in. What'd you come for? Can't you guess? - Look, I don't have time for games. You've come to see the fort? Did you look inside? No, not yet. What are you looking at? Your bugle. Do you sleep with it? Practically. Was it a present? - It was Grandpa's. He used to come and take me on his knee and try to teach me how to play it. I have to go now. - Okay. Goodbye. You've got a thread hanging there. - You've got a hole in your mitten. Last summer I was going to build a castle in my back yard. I had about a ton of cardboard, but it... Will you stop following me around? I want to be in the war too! Go on home, you're too young! Go on, I said. Boy, he gets on my nerves! He follows me everywhere. Anywhere, where was I? Oh yeah, it rained and all the cardboard melted. It took me... It took me 3 days just to clean it up. So much for that. But then I got an idea. I thought why not build a model of a castle instead? It would be less work. I could make the designs as complicated as I want, and I could even make cut-out soldiers for sieges and battles and everything... so I made this huge batch of paper-mache and started on the walls... Hey, look who's going to church! ... and this time I was getting mad... Hey, Luc's going in. They must be out to ambush him! Luc! Luc! We've got to do something. Let's go. Okay now, when you see me put my hand down like this, that means I want you to be quiet, okay? The chorus was much too loud. Okay, once more. What's he after anyway? Some people should have more respect. Don't take your eyes off him, Pierre. He can be very tricky. What's happening? - Nothing special. What did you come for? Well, do you think maybe we could stop the war for a day or two, hold a truce? So, you noticed that your army needs work, huh? It's Christmas, you ninny! All the real wars knock it off at Christmas, don't you know anything? Alright, alright, you don't have to get mad! Is that all you came for? Let me borrow your skis? Come to my place sometime. - Oh, thanks, I'd like to. I'll have to talk to the others, I can't give my answer... Alright, freeze! I knew it! I knew it was a trap! What do you think you're doing? We came to rescue you! - Hold your fire, hold your fire! If you want him, you can have him. I knew they were in there, so I got the army together. I thought it was an ambush. You blundering idiot, I was spying on the enemy! Could I talk to them too, if it's for spying? I do all the spying in this army, got that? Hey, next time we attack, you've had it! - Yeah, yeah. He's in for a big surprise, isn't he? What is it? - Look! Still at war, huh guys? False alarm men, it's just Ti-Guy La Lune. Hey, wait for us, everybody! Shhh! You said you couldn't come and then you bring your little sister. Wake up Jean! How'd you spy us in our camouflage? Another girl, armies sure have changed! - I can do anything you can. I said she could come if she felt like it. - Well, you should have! You're supposed to clear everything with your commanding officer. Okay, wanna join? We'll let you if you put a snowball over the top of that big fir tree. Way over there? I bet nobody in your bunch can throw that far! Huh? - Just watch this. - We'll see about that, Smarty. That'll show you. - Bet you I do it on the first try! Out of the way, come on! - Shove over. It's farther than it looks. - Not even close! Hold it, hold it, stop wasting the ammunition. You're making too much noise too! Come on then, if you want. What should we do with Ti-Guy? He'd be a fantastic scout. He could give us signals. Give us a signal, Ti-Guy! Hey, not bad. - Thanks, but I don't want to play war. What a sap! - Goody two-shoes! Here, I'll get it! - Now remember, keep quiet! Ti-Guy! - It's a secret mission. It's dripping out. - Plug the hole with a little snow. Don't put so much! - It's okay. Hold still. Hurry up, they're coming! What the heck is this? Retreat! Retreat you guys! Every man for himself. Get out of here, retreat. Let's get out of here, run! Run for it! - Get the ladder, Chabot! Ugh! The paint ran right up my sleeves. Now look what you've done. You and your bright ideas! Well, anyway, we won! He warned you about putting too much. - You're as bad as Luc, you won't listen to anyone. You should have been careful, that's all! - That's a laugh! I don't think it comes out too easily either. What? This isn't going to come out? - Oh no!!! Better? - Maybe. Depends on what you like, I guess. Can you still see it? - Just keep scrubbing, okay? We're not going to fight paint battles. Now my brand new vest is wrecked. There's still some on your forehead, Maranda. I know, I know. It's all over your back. Don't bother. There's no more gas in the tank. Okay boys, who'll be going first? We will. We will. Here we are! - Who'll go first boys, come on! Are you deaf? We will! - Oh! This last spot won't come out. - Here, try it with this. It should be in the rules... no paint in snowballs! Should be, I know, but it's not. We've just got to get better prepared for them. Right. - I could sign up my girl friends. Oh, we'll see. I'd lay odds those idiot sisters started this. They're off their rockers. Luc, what if I tell my mom and dad? They'd be on the phone to their mothers... so fast they'd be grounded by morning. Poor little baby! Got a problem so you run home to Mommy and Daddy? Well, go on if you're not man enough to take care of yourself! Hey, have any gum? I still have the taste of gas in my mouth. You can have this... sort of used though. Chabot? I'll just be a minute or two. How come you let him be so mean to you? Does it look any better yet? A little, I guess. - Don't move. Hey, don't you guys think it smells funny? It's worse than ever now! - Let me look. It's much better! - Are you blind? It looks awful! Come on, it looks okay. Who's after them? Now, keep quiet Cleo. You're not supposed to be in here, ... and you know it, don't you? Big softy! Oh no, you just stay put because I don't want any more problems, girl. Aw! It still won't come out. Dumb girls! Oh, Bobby! Why do you keep throwing them on the floor? To watch your poor old daddy pick them up, huh? Sure, I know, you don't fool me, Buster! There. Now hang onto it for a while. Now let Daddy read his paper, okay? Oh no! I don't... Cleo! Lucie! - It's okay, Mom. I know how to measure it. It'll come out perfect. You watch. I hope so. You're the one who has to wear it, my dear. It looks okay so far. - Yep. You should have seen it, Mom! The whole battle took about 2 minutes. Did they get out fast! They looked furious! Luc will never learn. He keeps provoking us. He'll have to learn. The way you look, you'd think you lost. Those guys are idiots. You give them a good idea, they say "okay, do it". But if anything goes wrong, bang, you're out of their good books and back to being a girl again. Well, maybe you could talk to them about it. It wouldn't change anything. They'd pretend not to know me. Big difference... who needs them anyhow? The troops' morale is low... but we will persevere. Important note: No more secret missions on the back path. And as for her, no more special treatment. If it's war she wants, it's war she's going to get. Can you give me a hand? Listen, François. Give it a rest. It's already the best fort ever. But I could still improve the tower! Want hot chocolate? Sure, thanks. Shhh! Someone's coming! Hello! Cleo, you've got to believe me. It's not the end of the world living in a doghouse. I have a nice carpet for floor that I bought. Wall-to-wall carpet, Cleo. So cheer up, eh? That's more than we have. You're a lucky dog, eh? A new home with carpets built in. What luxury! She's really in a mood. You can't blame her. She thinks she belongs at home. But she keeps peeing everywhere. She disobeys me too. It's because of Bobby. Ever since he was born she thinks we don't love her anymore. As if anybody wouldn't love you, you silly dog! Lucie, are you coming or not? - I'll be in as soon as I can, Cleo's depressed! I've almost finished the walls and you haven't even started! I'll come and finish those windows after! Either you come finish your job now, or I'm going to finish it! Now, with my color? Oh no, if I do the job I choose the color! She and Cleo should get together. They're both miserable. But you would never blackmail your sister like Sophie, huh? Don't push me, Lucie, I'm warning you! Whew! She has a bit of a temper, eh? Ha! In 10 minutes she'll forget all about it. Right, Cleo? I said, isn't that right, Cleo? Cleo! Keep an eye on her, Pierre. It could be a nervous breakdown. Hello in the fort! If you value your lives, surrender. We have you surrounded! Surrender! Hey, neat bullhorn! - Thanks, it's my uncle's. Give me that! Section two! Section one! Ready? Fire at will! What did he say? - "Fire at will". It means start shooting! So, what's the matter with "start shooting"? Go call the others. - Okay. Hello? Hello? Lucie? Come in, Lucie. Can you read me, Lucie? Lucie? - Hello, hello? Come quickly! We're under attack! Hello? You should never buy American radios. - It cost me a fortune. Were you making that "shhhh" noise, you were, weren't you? Sure, it makes it like TV. It's more fun. Just get over here. We're being attacked! Okay, we'll be over in about 10 minutes. - Make it fast! Hey, they've even got a ladder. You can see everything through this thing, guys. Here! Position the ladder! Section 2 and 3, fall back on your flanks! Okay, General. - Ladder's up, Luc. Your flank, your flank... So, what's a "flank"? Storm the ramparts! - Will you speak French? Show no mercy! Show no mercy? Alright! And don't forget, if you win I've got a surprise for you! Up you go, Jean! - Aye aye, General! Keep firing Ti-Guy! Ouch! - So much for Jean. Are you nuts or something? Keep going, Jean! - I'll climb up, but I'm not going first. Let me down! Trying to kill somebody? Okay, but do it fast! Hold on tight, Chabot, I'm going up! They're maniacs, paint all over your clothes, ice blocks on your head... I quit! We'll have to run for it! - Think so? - Come on! Enough is enough! Luc! Luc, they're down here! Uh-oh! They're getting away! Where are they? - They left on a toboggan. Quick! You clumsy little nitwit! They got away! Hello, you two. The war's over. It's all over. I promised you a surprise if we won, right? - Yeah, right. That's right. They've got no right. That's our fort. I bet they pull the whole thing apart. You bunch of bums, you! (more comments in Vietnamese) You've won a great victory, men. What about us girls, huh? - Men and women, okay. There were only those two. It doesn't matter. We were so organized. I wish they'd all been here. Leroux, Leroux, take a look around. - For what? The counterattack. You never know. Counterattack... Gonna counterattack our flank, right? Look out, Chabot. Look out, Chabot. Look, Jean, they've made a trumpet into a sword. Oh yeah, look at that! Mind if I look? Hey look, Leroux! - Where? Down there. - Oh, yeah! Don't run boy, it's all over! Look, a whole box of chicken soup. Ti-Guy, you can have a little. - Okay. The minute you join up... - Then just forget it. Real smart guy, eh? Ah, phooey, Luc! Those jerks finished all of the cookies. It's not the end of the world. Could have left some for us. Stop being a big baby! Sure, everybody's a big baby to you. - Gonna look around or will I have to do it? Oh, right away, yes sir! Here comes Sophie and her sister! Where's Pierre? - He had to finish Cleo's doghouse. You're joking. Aren't we as important as Cleo? No, because she's going through a difficult period! They even took down our flag and put up some old rag instead. Yeah, and it's all your fault! But I wasn't here. You can't blame me! That's just it! You should have been here... "Oh no, I've got to stay home today and plot a lot of dumb ideas." That's not fair, and stop trying to blame it all on me! Oh well, at least the secret tunnel worked. Oh no! I left my walkie-talkie in the fort! Well I've had a bellyfull. I've had it up to here with this thing! You can go too. I'll stay and spy on them. And don't pretend you can order us all around, okay? Come on, Lucie. Come home, Sophie. It's almost dinnertime. Why is Jean-Louis mad at you? Don't worry about it. He's upset, that's all. So? You get upset at me sometimes too. But I don't cry... well, not in front of you anyway. Okay, fall in! There's another hour before dark. We're leaving! It's you. Take her prisoner! Let's go! - Quick, get the flag! - Get her! - Don't let her get away! Scale the wall, on the double! Pick it up, quick! Chabot, the tunnel! Hey, Leroux, come on. It's her, it's her. - After her, fast! Luc, she's over here! - Don't let her get away! It's dark in the woods. - You've got your flashlights, go on! Okay, let's go! Wait for me! Andy! Chabot! Wait for me! Luc! Luc! - There she goes! That way, Chabot! - She snitched my flashlight! You turkey! Come on men, quick! I'm sick of being in his army. - Me too. All he ever does is yell at us. Yeah, now we'll go home and get yelled at again for being late. There she is! There she is, I can see her. Ugh! I'm stuck! Hurry up! She's almost at the road. - Quick! Where is she? - Don't ask me. She gave me the slip. You're going to pay for this, Sophie. You just wait! Move out, men. Darn, if I hadn't slipped I would've had her. Come here, Maranda... Luc! Wait for me. ...so I grabbed his flashlight and started back to the fort, but then I ran right into the second gang. So I started running away. Did you get hurt? No,but they were right behind me. And you got their flag. Incredible! You were really great. - That's not what you said before. Just forget all that alright? You've redeemed yourself. Admit it, girls are better! - Not exactly what I said! Don't get angry, Jean-Louis! Does that mean you're willing to listen to my plan? Pierre? Huh? - Don't worry, Cleo will perk up, you'll see. No food in two days. I'm getting worried. She's probably just lonely. - Yeah, bring her along with us. I will when I can. Now if anyone gets up to her, she growls. She's not the same dog. She's probably just feeling old. You feel bad when you get old. Oh no. Go on back home! I think they're spying on you. - (comments in Vietnamese) It's like having a second shadow with him around. What do you want? - Luc sent me over. I don't believe it! You came without your brother? He's up standing guard. We're not crazy. What does Luc want? I have to say: Your other ski and both poles are still in the fort... and if you want them, you have to win them in battle. Go tell him we're coming! - Yeah. Hey, be nice. Give me back my light. Sorry, I haven't had time to use up the batteries yet. Hey, don't! - Get lost. Scram! Ouch! Go for it Daniel! You can do it. Faster, that's it. Ladies and gentlemen, you're watching a world champion in action, Daniel Blanchette and an amazing tractor! Step on it, Daniel. They're gaining on you! Ladies and gentlemen, the tractor's just flying around this track! It looks like Daniel has the race wrapped up! Yahoo! - What are you doing? Just playing. Luc made us the barn's official caretakers. Hi. Daniel Blanchette from Victoriaville. But the war is over, isn't it? - Ha, it just started! Don't touch the bullhorn. Luc said not to. Here, take this flag to Luc. - Hey! - What for? And tell him to hurry up if he wants to see his headquarters again. Come on, Daniel. While they're on their way here... all of us go back to the fort on the back path and... Sounds great. - In the meantime, let's clean this place out. Good idea. I found him on the hill up there. He couldn't walk, so I took him home and put on a splint... and kept him in the shed for a month and then I brought him back. I've seen him twice since then, but he won't come back to me now. I should have known. Wow! What is that, Ti-Guy? - A trap. What's it for? - To catch a fox that lives here. Do you know who put it there? - Some murderer who likes to kill animals. Oh be careful! Hey, wait! I've got an idea. No, that goes there. - I know, I know. Help! Help! Keep it down! - Hey, sounds like my megaphone! It's not yours, it's my uncle's. - Listen! Help, somebody! Ti-Guy's badly hurt. He has caught his foot in a fox trap! Tell them it's a bear trap... it sounds bigger! A bear trap, I meant... it sounds bigger! Help! There's been an accident! Oh, it's awful, hurry! We're down by the river! - Hey, did you hear that? Help! Ti-Guy's caught his foot in a bear trap and he's really hurt! Hey, just say I'm dead. - They may not bother to come then. Just say I'm dying, at least! I'm out cold and turning blue then. He's turning blue and, uh, he's out cold and I'm really scared! He's bleeding all over the place too! Yeah, good. Tell them they've got to bring bandages! Ti-Guy says you've got to bring a lot of bandages! I'm out cold, you idiot! I can't talk! He told me that before he went out cold! That's the end of our whole plan! What a waste. I bet he's faking! - Better check it out. Bet you a whole buck Ti-Guy's faking. We'd better take the whole army. How about the fort? - You'll have to stay and guard it. ... we're still down by the river... - I just know it's a trap. I just know it. Come on, he's turning bluer! Are these people close friends of yours? Just try it again, okay? Oh crum, it's starting to snow. Just one more try! Ah... last call, if you want to rescue Ti-Guy you'll... Lie down, quick! Hey, who's the little guy? - That's Ti-Guy's cousin. Daniel Blanchette from Victoriaville. Is Ti-Guy faking? No, he's very badly hurt. I'm afraid he might die so I guess you better forget your war... Oh Daniel, you're hopeless. - ...and get together and help us. Get off, I saw him talk! No, no, his lips move a lot, because of the cold. He's not faking. On my honor, he's not! You go ahead first. We'll follow. Okay! Be careful you guys, okay? I smell a dirty trick. Well, he isn't moving now. We'd better go for a doctor. Hello. Who is it? - What is this, he's awake! It's a miracle. Maybe there's still hope! Your friends came to help you, Ti-Guy. Boy, I don't like this business. Ti-Guy! Ti-Guy, you'd better be in that trap for real! Careful, don't let it snap shut on your fingers! Okay, set it down. - What should we do? Really he's faking. He's faking, pass it on! Oh, the pain! - I hope you can walk. Don't move a muscle. I'll get a stretcher. He's just kidding. On my honor, he is. He's faking. Does it hurt when I touch it? Let's take off his boot. - No, it's freezing! His foot will swell... like a balloon. We'll have to carry him to the village. - After I've seen if his foot is broken. I like playing rescue. It's a lot more fun than war, huh? How about setting a bunch of traps around, guys? Yeah, big joke. Very cute, Ti-Guy! What are you doing here? - Well, you never came back. Is your foot bad, Ti-Guy? It's amazing. It has never been better! Tomorrow is the last day of vacation, but no big battles have been fought yet. You say that because you've lost them all, Luc. How come we're in the fort then? I think it's fair to say we're both tied. - Okay, next battle decides it all. Come on, everyone! We'll even let you have your fort. - We wouldn't want it back anyway. Oh yeah, sure, sure... - Come on, forget it. You'd just better be ready tomorrow! - Yeah, you'd better be ready tomorrow... If we don't capture the fort tomorrow, they'll win the bounty chest. We'll win it. - Think so? - Bet you a whole buck! It's not over after all, I guess. Look at this! Cleo, you have to eat sometime, you know. I have to go to the battle. I'm already late. I'd love to take you, but I can't. Because you growl at people! I'll be home as soon as I can. Bye, Cleo. Paul! Paul! They're on their way! They must have sneaked up through the woods! They're over there! If you can buy candy for them, why can't you buy some for us? We're fighting this battle for glory. Well I'd rather be fighting for candy. You're not much of a soldier! Hey, what's he doing on their side? Okay, charge! Help! We can't get over! Come on! Andy, come here and help me! Help! I'm all tangled up. Luc, I can't get over either. Help me, somebody, I'm still stuck! Darn, they've plugged it up! Split up and move around more. Chabot, get them closer to the wall! Take Jean with you! - Aye, aye, General! Come closer! Come closer! What's that thing? Out of the way! Fire! ... You make me very, very angry! Get out of there. François, it's your little brother! Cut it out! Don't do that! (comments in Vietnamese) Come on, move closer. Better storm their flanks. - What's a flank? What's a flank? It's a flank! You must know what a flank is! Ah, just forget it! Fire! Ready? - All set. Okay, fire! Hey, it works! It works! Fire! Oh, we got it right! Okay, when I give the signal, we all throw at the same time. Okay... go! Come on, throw higher! They're on the top! We can't throw that far! Coming with me? Come on, Chabot, get the ladder fast! Hey! Look, I broke my sword! - Do you mind? We have our own troubles. What are you doing here? - Observing. Watch it, get out of the way. Go on, hurry up. Over the top! - Ow! Get down, I'm wounded. Okay, nice big smile. Aw, you can look happier than that! Now that's more like it. Jean, go up. I'll hold it. What did I ever do to you? I can't find my mitten! Get up there, come on, and bring the other ladder! Geronimo! What? What are you doing there? Daylight! I did it! Give me my sword. Here, Cleo! Everyone, over the wall! Pierre! Pierre, it's Cleo! Cleo! Get her out! Quick! Help me! Hang on, Cleo, we're coming. Help me. Cleo, Cleo! We're coming, Cleo! We're coming, girl! Oh, Cleo, Cleo... Cleo? We'll bury her here. Impossible. The ground's too hard. In the barn then. She liked it there. You're kidding. There's no room in... - No, I'm not kidding. So shut up, okay? We'll have to cover her. Chabot, Chabot, come and give me a hand. Hang on. Take it... for when you get a new dog. I don't want some other dog. I want my Cleo back! The war is over now, for good. Still, it wasn't a bad vacation. - Too short for me. I've already made a plan for a treehouse we can build this summer! Where are you off to, Jean-Louis? I'm going to get my stuff at the fort. Do you want to come, Pierre? I'll be right with you. Want to go too? - Okay. I wanted to come and say thanks. For what? For Cleo. You read my diary, didn't you? No, not yet. Pierre! Don't interfere. That feels better! Yeah, I'll bet it does! Hey, wait for me! Yahoo! Yeah... Oh, there will be other forts!
