- Okay. Here you go, babe. - Thank you. - Great job. - Come on, bud. Superheroes have to wear clothes to school. - Finished. Lunchbox? - Over there. - Alright. Backpack? - By the front door. - Great. But do you have the latest edition of Science Tomorrow? - Thank you, thank you, thank you! - Okay, one condition. If they change Pluto's status again, you gotta let me down easy, because I am on a rollercoaster of emotions. - We're running out of fuel! We have to land! Coming into a crash landing! Goosh! Okay. What next? - Books in the backpack! - Books in the backpack. - Pew, pew, pew! - Oh man, I know a tiny superhero who's supposed to get a dog today, but if we can't get ready for school in time I don't know-- - Oh no, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it! - What else? Lunch! - Right. Thanks, Dad. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Today's the day! - Okay. So this is about the dog presentation? Again? - As you know, today is the final day of the pet adoption at our school. - Mhm. - And this dog is the best dog for our family. He's been in the shelter for a really, really long time, and he deserves a forever home. He's loyal, smart, playful, and he's really, really cute. - That is one cute dog. - Mom, please? Please can we get this dog? It's the last day. - Ugh. I don't know, Sophia. I mean, what am I supposed to do, you know? About all of these dog toys if we don't go adopt your dog today! Aw. - Morning. - Hey, babe. - Hey. - Hi, Bianca. Want some eggs? - I'll have a tiny bit. But I just came by to say goodbye to you and your dad. - Where you going? - Um, my job is sending me to Chicago. There's a huge court case. - With bad guy villains? - Yes. I have to fight villains with paperwork. - Okay. Hey, Bianca, guess what? - What? - We're getting a dog today! - A dog? That is huge news, are you so excited? - I am the most excited! - Awesome. - Bianca. - What? - Do you like dogs? - I love dogs. I am just very allergic to them. - What? Are you really? How did I not know this? - I don't know, I guess it just never came out. - Hey, Owen, do you want to go play with Awesome Patrol Pals for five minutes? - Bye. - I feel so sorry. - No. - He's wanted a dog for I don't know how long, and we just-- - No, it's a no brainer. You get the dog, I'll get some Benadryl. It's fine. - A whole month, huh? - I know. But I'll call you as soon as I land tonight. - What time? I have the last day of the PTA pet adoptions today, and we're actually gonna bring the dog back here tonight to get it adjusted, and then I still have to take a peek at this project for work before tomorrow, I go through the-- - No wonder Owen is obsessed with superheroes. He lives with one. - Thank you for being so understanding of this whole "Superdad" thing. - Oh, please. Superdad is cute. - He may be cute, but I understand that it's made us take things much more slowly, and I just want you to know that I appreciate your patience. - And I am more than happy to do that. But I would like to know... - Right, where we are going. I get it. Okay, well I think we're gonna use this time apart to think about us. - Yeah. Between career altering court cases and PTA pet adoptions. - Superdad can handle it. - Okay. - Good job. Hey, hi, good morning. - Hey. - Hey, good morning! How are you? - No way. - Even added an itemized budget to appease Councilwoman Palisa. - Come on, man. You're making the rest of us look bad. Thank you. Enjoy your lunch. - Thank you. Hey. - Hey. Brainstorm time? - Okay. One second. Hello? - Kate. Come see me please. - Okay. Yep, be right there. - Come in, take a seat. - Okay, but before you say anything, I would just like to point out that I have a long track record of making excellent films for this studio. - We know and-- - And I believe that we are the future of animation because we take risk, you know? And sometimes those risk are-- - Can I just-- - Ugh, which is why I just wanted to reassure you-- - Kate! - Yes, yes, yes. - We know. And I feel like I would be doing you a disservice if I didn't tell you that your short, "Light The Way", has been accepted to the Georgia Animation Festival, end of next month. - But the winner of that-- - Qualifies to submit for the Best Animated Short at the Oscars. - Are you serious? You're not serious. - Dead serious. We love it. And provided you rework the ending as we discussed, we think this short has the creative depth to go all the way. They already accepted you from a 30 second unfinished clip we submitted. - I'm just gonna need just two minutes. Just, okay. Okay, just two seconds. Okay. - I can hear you. - Okay. We are not gonna disappoint you, we are going to blow you away. - Kate. - Yeah. - Out of curiosity. - Yeah. - How is the ending coming? - It's a mess. It's a total mess. - Award season? Seriously? - Yes! - That's awesome! Yes! - Which means we have six weeks to come up with a new ending, and animate it. - Sorry, six weeks? - Yeah. - Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool. - Welp. We're doomed. - No, come on! We're not doomed, we're not doomed. You guys are some of the finest animators on the planet, okay? We got this. - Okay, in a sense, one might say we do got this. As in we already have an ending. - No. - A perfect ending that you keep. - And as the director, I'm gonna say that that is the wrong direction. Yes, Jordan. - Sorry. I know I'm new around here, but can you all explain why they just can't be in love? - No, no, no, no, no, nope. Shh. - Ah, come on! - What? What did I do? - You can't just come out and say the L word in front of Kate. - I am not against love. - No, no, no, not at all. Let's just do a quick count of how many love stories you've created. Oh wait, none. - Don't listen to them. First of all, no, I love love. I just don't think it's right for me, for it, for the story. - You said yourself this has to be great. Well, some of the greatest stories ever told are love stories. Without love, the Odyssey is just like 10 years of some dude in a boat getting lost. - Yeah, Kate. This story has starlight, a daring rescue, it wants to be a romance! - I hear you, okay? But the studio is taking a huge chance on this short because they believe that we're gonna come up with something original. Which means subverting expectations. - Okay, that's fair. - Thank you. - Okay, friend to friend, I gotta ask, are you sure you're not letting your own personal hangups get in the way of what's best for this story? - I don't have any hangups. Oh. Liam hold on, one second. Hi, Liam. Can I put you on mute for two seconds? - Okay. - I'm just saying, you turn down romantic plots at the office. You turned down that really cute guy at the coffee shop that asked for your number. - He ordered an extra shot, extra hot, extra whipped, sugar free caramel macchiato, that is not just high maintenance, that is nonsense. - But you haven't been on a date since you and Liam got divorced, five years ago. - Well, that is because I have been busy making beautiful films and co-parenting my beautiful child. - Liam isn't afraid to put himself out there. Liam is dating. Liam is wining and dining. Liam is-- - Liam is still here. Not on mute. But for what it's worth, I totally agree with Nadia, Kate. You need to get back out there. - Bye. - I'm just saying. - You know what, Liam? I am not taking dating advice from a man who took me to a drive-through fast food place before prom. - You told me no cliche romantic gestures. I stand by it. - Fair enough. What's going on? - So you're getting a dog? - A full on PowerPoint presentation. How did a photographer and an animator end up with such a serious child? - Oh, well, I come from a long line of vagrant artists, Kate. I blame your family. She's definitely your father's mini me. - Oh, she so is. Which is why I have to get her this dog. She just needs to get outside, and roll around in the mud, and make some mistakes. - Yeah, she needs to be a kid. - Yes. Oh, we're adopting the dog after school today. Can I change shifts with you? - Yeah, of course. Just remember that you need to pick her up today, and then drop her off in the morning because I'm gonna be-- - In Bali for the next two weeks. I'm on it. - Alright, great. Thank you. I owe you. - Just bring Sophia back a souvenir. Something nice. Not from the airport. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - How we doing? - We've only got one dog and three cats left. So I'd say this has been a phenomenal success. - That's amazing. - Yes! - Dad, can I please go say hi to my new dog? - Yeah, pal. Just stay over there where I can see you, okay? - Two. - Two what? - Two volunteers for the carnival. - What? How is that possible? Two in all these parents? - Please, I have tried everything. No takers. - Hey, hey, hey. We'll get it sorted. Two is not a total disaster. This is a total disaster. I leave the office for two minutes, and then of a sudden it's they just can't. Aw man, I'm sorry. What were you saying? - Hey. Remember when you said you were only gonna take this job for a year, tops? Now here you are, five years later, overworked, overcaffeinated - I'm sorry. Are you giving me a lecture about working too hard? This is coming from a teacher? Hello pot, kettle. We meet again. - Okay, well, it's different when you love what you do. Okay? - I'm sorry. Who is that? Why don't I know her? - Because some parents manage to wriggle free from the tentacles of the PTA. - Oh, not on my watch. Excuse me! Hi there, pardon me. - Hi. - I don't think we've met. My name is Eric Smith, I'm the president of the PTA. - Oh, I'm Kate Healy. And this is my daughter, Sophia. - Oh, hello, Sophia. - Hi. - Nice to meet you, I'm Eric. You excited to adopt a pet today? - Yes. - Well, and clearly we're not the only ones. - Look, I don't want to brag, but that volunteer over there may or may not have just told me that this event has been a phenomenal success. - More like fur-nomenal, am I right? It's just a little dad humor. Alright. Dad jokes. Not for all dads. Anyway, congrats on the success of the event, and please tell everyone at the PTA thank you so much for your hard work. - I'm actually glad to hear you feel that way. We are in desperate need of some more parent volunteers for the spring carnival. - I would love to-- - Great. - So much, but I am, you know, a single parent with a full-time job, just not a lot of time for the PTA. - I understand. I'm a single parent with a full-time job. - Okay, this is the truth. Every year I go to that carnival. - So you understand how important this is. - The same carnival. I believe that bean bag toss once belonged to the settlers who crossed the Atlantic Ocean. - If it ain't broke, don't fix it. - If it ain't broke, you don't need me. - This is him, Mom. - Look. I really appreciate everything that you do. And today, I plan to support the PTA to the fullest by adopting that dog right over there. - What, that dog? You can't adopt that dog. - Why? - Because we're adopting that dog. - Oh. You must be Sophia's mom, and Owen's dad. - Yes. - This is Bruce. - Hey, Bruce. - Owen, sweetie, are you sure this is the dog? - Yeah. His name is Bruce, like Bruce Wayne. He's Batdog, Dad. - You know what, Sophia, why don't we just find another dog who needs a home? - Because I said in my presentation-- - Yeah, right, got it. - You got a presentation? - She's a go getter. - Wow. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. Guys, could you give us five minutes here? - Yeah. Let's go, come on. - Thank you guys. - Thanks guys, thank you. - Okay, look. My family's had a really hard time. Owen could definitely use this friend. - I hear you, I got a 25 point presentation, from a 10 year old, before 8:00 a.m. I don't want to break your kid's heart. - Yeah, me either. Okay, look. It's not like there's a shortage of dogs who need homes. - That's true. - Why don't we just agree to be bigger people, and find other dogs? - You promised. - Please, Mom. - Wait, wait, wait. - I promised him. - No, I know. - Please don't do this. I'm sorry. It's just Bruce, he's an older dog, he's not a puppy, and he's kind of shy around other dogs, so he's been pretty anxious at the shelter. We've been waiting a long time for somebody to love Bruce, and I mean, now there's two families interested. - The fact-- - But what do we do here? You know, do we flip a coin? That doesn't seem fair. - We don't have to decide today. - Okay. - I'm assuming, since your kids go to the same school, that you live in roughly the same area? - Rainier Boulevard. - Dogwood Drive. - Stop. - It's not a dad joke, I actually live there. But you gotta admit, it's pure gold. - Okay, okay. So you could co-foster Bruce for a month or so, meet up a couple times a week to trade off. That way we make sure that Bruce finds the best possible home. - Mm. - And it's rare, but this dog fell in love twice today. And who are we to get in the way of that? - One month. - Trust me. You learn a lot in a month. - Okay. I could do one month. - Yeah. - Yay! - Sophia, have you seen my laptop? Hey. What's wrong? - You told me to go outside and take Bruce to go play. So I decided to research dog games. But everyone on the internet just seems to disagree with each other. - Oh boy. Okay. Well, remember the rules? We never, ever research on the internet without Mommy. And we never, ever, ever look at the comments. Okay? - Okay. - Second, just look at his face. You know what? You just gotta get out there, and you have to have fun, and get messy, and as long as you're kind to him, then you'll do great. You want me to show you how it's done? Yeah! Okay. Come on, Bruce! Let's go play. Okay. We have all the necessities. - We've got a detailed schedule, a copy of the rules for both houses, and a very thoroughly researched obedience plan. - We've got dog toys, dog treats, human treats. - We are organized, we are prepared. - We are loving, we are fun, we are-- - Fun loving? - Yes! Doubling down, we are fun loving. - We are gonna prove to them that we're the most responsible dog owners in the world, buddy. - And make new friends. - Oh, okay, wait. Hey, listen to me. It is important to be nice, it is, but it's kinda like, what did Captain Hammerhead do when he had to make a deal with Professor Platypus? Quick. - Power pose and poker face. - Power pose and poker face, yes. - Sharing a dog, pft. We're expert sharers. We're gonna win them over with our charm and kindness. - And cookies. - Mostly cookies. Hi, friends. - Hey there, how are you? Hi, Sophia. - We come bearing gifts. We have a Bruce. And his favorite Moo-Cow. - Moo-Cow? - A working title. We can change the name. Yeah. And cookies. - Oh, actually. Sorry, almost dinner time, yeah? We'll have maybe one for dessert, yeah? - Hey, is that Captain Hammerhead from the Awesome Patrol Pals? - Yeah, I love 'em! - Did you know that my mom made him? - It's true. I imagined him in my head, and then I drew him, and then he came to life. - Really? - Yeah. I'm an animator, so it's my job to draw really cool things. - Actually, Sophia, yes. About the treats reminded me. I feel like we should get on the same page about rules if our dog's gonna be staying with you guys. - Your dog? - Starting with treats and rewards, right there. See? - Oh, wow. Did you laminate these? - Yes, I did. If we're gonna help Bruce feel secure, I think it's important that we give him a structured, consistent environment. - Sure. We also need to meet him where he's at. You know? Follow his cues. - Rules and boundaries will actually help him feel more secure. - Or break his spirit. - Can we take Bruce to go play? - Please? - Yeah, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Absolutely, here. Come on, Bruce! Go have fun, buddy. Bye, Bruce! - Just stay where I can see you! - Stay where I can see you! - Okay. - So, I'm guessing that obedience school is out of the question? - If Bruce is going to go somewhere to be trained, I would like to approve that, and attend. - Okay, sure. How about this. You can come with me, and I will even let you choose the school. - Deal. - Great. As long as you agree to volunteer for the spring carnival. - Oh, I don't have a sitter. - PTA provides one. Fully vetted high school honors student. - What about Bruce? - Oh, dogs are welcome. - Okay, Eric Smith. This round is yours. - Have a good weekend. See you Monday, 6:00 p.m. sharp. Hey, Owen, come on buddy, let's go! - Good boy. - You sure you don't want to watch something new, pal? - Dad, it's my favorite! And plus, Bruce has never seen it. - Okay. Alright, Bruce. Come here, pal. - C'mon, Bruce! - Look at that. - Kate. Is that our Kate? - Yeah, that's our, I mean, it's Ms. Healy to us, bud. - Hey. - Hi! - Looks like Eric sent you too, huh? - Yeah, he did, he did. Hi, Ms. Ramirez! Putting the T in PTA, I see. - Ah, well someone has to rep the teachers. It's nice to see you, Ms. Healy. - Oh, please. Call me Kate. By the way, I have to tell you, Sophia's having the time of her life with you in Science Club. - Oh, good. Well, if she can keep a secret, let her know that I'm applying for a field trip next month that will blow her mind. Spoiler alert, it involves the science center's galaxy exhibit. - I call chaperone. - Are you an astronomy nerd? - Yes, I am. Oh, I've been obsessed with constellations since I was a kid. - Did we just become best friends? - I think we might have. - It was nice to see you. - Yeah, you too. - I'll do that as well. Okay, last order of business, I know you all have jobs to get back to. Committee heads for the spring carnival. Susan, you'll do the cake walk again as usual. Okay. Allison, you'll be in charge of the games again as usual, I'll be in charge of the tickets again as usual. And our newest member, Kate, will be in charge of the silent auction. Everyone, give Kate a big, warm welcome. - Thank you. - Alright, I want us all to break off into groups in a moment-- - Oh. - And I want you all to really think about what... Yeah. - Hi, yes. What, um... What do I do? - You're in charge of the silent auction. - Oh, like the auctioneer? Hey, can I get a one dolla, one dolla, going once! - No, it's a silent auction. - So you want me to just do it silently. - Are you... No, your job is to get businesses to donate items for prizes for the auction, then you're gonna monitor the auction, and then you'll be in charge of announcing the winners. That's it, very easy. Okay, I want us all to break off into groups, and I want to really think about... Yeah, Kate? - What is the theme? For the carnival. - No, there's never been a theme, it's just spring carnival. - I mean, that's your problem right there. You gotta have a theme. - Well, what do you have in mind? - Well, I mean, let's think about it for a second. It should be something that sparks kids' imaginations, right? Kids love pirates, we could do space! Could you imagine how cool-- - The thing is atually, the-- - It would be? For them to walk in and be like-- - We don't have the budget to revamp the entire carnival. - Well, I mean, I'm not opposed to hearing some fresh ideas. All in favor? - Okay. Okay. Sure. At our next meeting, we'll discuss potential themes. Great, wonderful. Any other thoughts, from anyone? Yes, Kate? - We need to talk about funnel cake. - Okay. - Right? - Meeting is adjourned! - Okay. - Folks, thank you. - You said if I join the PTA, I could choose the obedience school. You brought this on yourself. - Join, follow. Not stage a coup in the school library. - Oh, come on. Even Carla said the PTA could use a bit more energy. A little fun. - Carla's my friend. She said that? - You gotta admit, you run that organization like a well oiled machine. You are a charismatic and efficient leader. - Thank you. - But-- - There it is. What are you doing? - Nope. Unfortunately, I detect no signs of it. - No signs of what? - Fun. Not a trace of fun. Oh. - I'm fun. I have lots of fun. - Okay, alright. So what's like, an adventure for you? - An adventure for me? - Yeah. - Um, okay, let's see. Hiking, hiking. Yeah. - Okay. - I'm taking Owen and Bruce hiking this weekend. - Yeah? - Mhm. Yeah, we're gonna go hiking down the Burke-Gilman Trail, right 'til we get to the docks, I'm gonna lay eyes on this traffic hot spot and just see if-- - Hey, Eric, what is it you said you did for a living? - I work for the Department of Transportation. - I knew it, I knew it! - But, but-- - No! That's work! - I do still-- - That's not fun! I award you zero points. - You should come with us. - What? - Consider it an olive branch. You'd be rescuing Owen from his lame, boring dad. Give Sophia a little more time with Bruce. Look at them. - Good boy! - Okay. We'll come. - Good. - Beautiful. - Look at that magnolia tree. Yeah. - Yeah. - Does he make you go on nature walks all the time? - Yeah. - Oh, I see a bench. - Oh. - There you go, bud. - Yeah. Oh, hey, show me one of your superhero moves! Let me see! Yeah, that's a good one! Want to play superhero red light, green light? - So I hear you've been teaching Bruce some tricks. - Of course. That's rule seven. I like your Bruce rules. They help me make sure I know what I'm doing. - Yeah. Me too. - Can I tell you a secret? - Sure. - I like that you laminated them. People are messy. - Yeah. Yeah, they are. - Red light! Wait a second! Where was the green light? - Wait. Aren't you supposed to wait for the green light? How's anyone supposed to win? - Oh, no. Owen's much more concerned with fun than winning. - My mom too. - Green light! Look at those moves! Mm. - Mm. - Penny for your thoughts? - For 20 years, we've been trying to find a safe way to close the gap on this trail. And we finally found something that was gonna work for everyone, and then that marina that we hiked past, they're now suing. After we found the solution that was gonna work for everyone, they're suing because they don't want to lose parking spots. - Hm, that's annoying. - Yeah. Tell me about it. Anyway, people keep telling me it's alright, be patient, we're gonna figure it out, we'll get it. But people are getting hurt in the meantime. It's just making me crazy. - Mm. Yeah. I get called crazy a lot at work. I like to think of it as being passionate. - I'm not sure I'm passionate about my job. I mean, it's not really where I saw myself ending up. - Well, what did you want to be when you grew up? - What adult has their childhood dream job? - I do. - Alright, well, we can't all be that lucky. - See, I don't think luck has anything to do with it. If you know what your North Star is, you can chart a course. - That was beautiful nonsense. - No, seriously. If you know what you want most, then you can figure out a way to get it. - I have a lot of responsibility, I'm a single dad. - What is it that you said to me when I said I couldn't do the PTA? Oh, right. I'm a single parent too, with a full-time job. - I was empathizing. - You were calling me out, and doing a remedial job of back peddling. So. This is me, empathizing. I'm a single parent too, with a full-time job, which I love. What do you love? - Affordable housing advocacy. I know it sounds boring, but that's my dream job. - Why? - I had an internship when I was in college, and we got to really fight against these developers to help protect lower income housing and I like going to bat for people. - So this superhero thing kind of runs in the family, huh? - Yeah, I guess so. - Nothing boring about that. - Got it, yeah. And then we can-- - Happy Monday! - You've got to stop doing that! - Never gets old! Look, consider this a small thank you gift. - Aw. - Aw, you're the best. - And a small I'm sorry gift. I drafted storyboards for three new possible endings last night, so conference room please. - You're the worst. - Thank you so much, you're the best. - The worst. - I love ya. I do, I do. Thank you so much. - I see you survived your hike. Four hours with Mr. PTA power trip, how was it? - It actually wasn't that bad. He was a lot more relaxed than I expected. - You mean to tell me, the guy who laminated the dog rules was fun? On a hike, uphill, with the bugs and everything? - Well, not so much the hiking part, but when we got ice cream, it was civil, dare I say, pleasant? - Well, everyone's pleasant when they've had ice cream, so. - Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. It's probably just a sprinkle induced glitch. - Alright, without further ado, may we present, CandyLand! Only full sized. - Okay. Check this out. We can take the tent poles, and we can turn them into candy canes. - Pardon me for jumping in here, Kate. This budget seems quite a bit out of our means though. - The paint shop could donate paint. - This is a very hefty time commitment for all of us. And we're not exactly a bunch of Van Gogh's. - Well, you know what? If Eric can keep everyone on budget, then I'll teach everyone how to paint. - Okay. Let's just put it to a vote. All those in favor. For someone who wanted nothing to do with the PTA, you sure made a lot of work for yourself. - Consider it an olive branch. Besides, I am choosing my battles. - Yeah? - Yeah. Speaking of our PTA agreement, I feel I should warn you, my friend, that you are in for an intense evening tomorrow. - How do you mean? - Well, I finally found an obedience school. Great place, solid reviews, it's called Fuzzy Friends Time. - Fuzzy Friends Time, isn't that-- - 7:00. Sharp. - I don't have a sitter. - Oh, you know what? I found us one. A fully vetted high school honors student. - Bye, Eric. - See you tomorrow. - And breathe. And exhale. And breathe. Exhale. Now once you've finished your breathing exercises, and you feel calm and centered, invite your pet to sit. - Bruce. Please sit. - Come on. He obviously already knew that word. - Okay. Bruce, please speak. There you go, good job. - Right, okay. Sit. Bruce, sit. Bruce, sit. Sit, sit, sit. Sit, sit, sit, bud. Come on, sit, sit, sit. - Breathe. - Sit, that's it. Come on, sit, sit. - Breathe. - I know, I got this. - How did you do, just-- - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Breathe. There you go. It's okay. Try again. - Bruce, please sit. - Good boy! - Good boy! - Good boy! - Good boy! He did it! - That's great, but calm. - Okay. Good boy, good boy. See? - Okay, wow, I'm a convert. Do you make house calls? - I am available for all of your home and office needs. - Perfect. Crazy boss? - Breathe. - Missed deadline? - Breathe. - Mm, yep. - Yeah. - That's a tough one. My son makes our living room wall into his own personal spaghetti art installation. - Mm, yeah, see now, that I support. - No, are you kidding me? That's just destruction. - Come on, you really have to just have more fun in your-- - No, that's not being mindful at all. - No, no, no, just-- - Hi. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hey. - Um, our fuzzy friends can sense when they're not receiving our full, energetic attention. - Oh, yeah. - So if we can just save the flirting for after class? - The... - Flirting? No. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. - Wow, that was 11 no's. - No? - No, mhm. - 12. - Oh, sorry. Since you're training the same dog, I assumed-- - No, no, no. We share the dog. - It's shared. - Yes. But we're not together. - I have a girlfriend, and she has a-- - A job. - Job. A great job, a great job. And a daughter. - She has a very good job. - Yeah, and a daughter. Which is why I don't really date. I mean, not that there's anything wrong with dating as a parent. So, we just share the dog, and he has a-- - Yeah, I have Bianca. - Bianca! He's got Bianca! So we're definitely, you know, not flirting. And this has just become embarrassing for all of us, so I'm just gonna stop disrupting the class, you know, with all the breathing, and the calm bodies, with all of the not flirting. So, I... Can... - That was awkward. - Uh, she said I'd appreciate it if you'd save the flirting for after class. Yeah. - Have more coffee, it fixes everything. - Mm. - Okay, I've seen some epic Kate speeches, but this, may officially elect you Mayor of Awkwardville. - Look, I haven't been accused of flirting in 10 years, at least. - Eh. - What? - Were you? - What? - Flirting! - What? No! - He said he's a single parent! - Who has a girlfriend, and look, I'm not dating anyone while Sophia's still in the house. Liam and I have a great system that ensures Sophia doesn't miss out on anything. I am not willing to gamble that. - If you say so. - What? - I'm just saying. I'm glad Sophia's not missing out on anything, but you might be. - And shake, nice to meet you. It's very nice to meet you, you're such a friend. Isn't it amazing? Here, do you want to give him one? - Hey. - My instructions a bit much? - A little bit. - Oh, pardon me, sorry. Kate! - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. - You forgot to leave Mr. Moo-Cow. - Oh. - I'm gonna have to stop by your office at lunch tomorrow and grab him. Is that okay? - Okay, yeah, yep. - Alright. - Okay. What's that face for? - Nothing, it's... It's just, so when he's with other people, he just has this whole Prince Charming routine-- - Oh. Would we call it that? - And then with me he's like, ugh, you know? - Okay. You can't compare yourself to those PTA parents. They've known him a long time, they're like family. When Amy passed away, they all rallied around him. They brought him casseroles, and baby sitters-- - Amy? - His wife. And my best friend. We taught here together. - Oh. I am so sorry. - Thanks. Me too. She was just one of those people who made you feel loved, you know? - Yeah. - She was grounded and steady, but there was this light about her. You push him outside of his comfort zone, like Amy did. It's good for him. He needs a friend like you. Okay. - Good morning! - Oh, don't do that! - Ha! Not so fun, is it? - Hey! - I'm sorry, did I scare you? - No. Hi. Oh, Moo-Cow. Yes, I totally forgot you were coming by. Hold on, so sorry. - It's okay. We need to work on that name by the way. This office is awesome. - Oh. - The ping pong out there. - Yeah. - They just play ping pong. - Um, hold on. I was on the phone with you, and then I picked up Moo-Cow, and I picked up my keys, and then I dropped my keys. I just totally left him by the front door. I'm so sorry. - It's okay, it's fine. Do you want to drop him off at my work when you pick Sophia up from school? I'm right by there. - Yeah, that would be great. I will do that. Here, write your address down. - Oh. Wow. - Oh, no, no, no, it's not finished, it's not. Oh. - Can I just take a peek? - You're just coming over. - It's amazing. - Well, it will be amazing once I come up with a heart stopping ending, which I decidedly have not. - Oh, is it a comedy or tragedy? - Why do you ask? - Well, if it's a comedy, they end up together, and if it's a tragedy, they're driven apart by the forces of fate or something. Those are the rules, right? - You love your rules. Well, it's actually not that simple. Those are the rules for romance, and this is not that. This is a story about courage, and self discovery, and-- - Love. - No! Why does everybody keep saying that? - Well, because they're obviously in love, look at how you drew them. - They're not in love. I mean-- - Okay, if you say so. I will leave you to it, and then I will see you today at three ish. Sorry, yep. - Hi. - Bianca wants to talk. - Uh oh. - No, before she left, we said we wanted to talk about the next steps when she got back. So I think it's positive, right? - Well, that depends. What do you want the next step to be? - I mean, there's lots to consider practically, but Bianca's great. Right? - Well, are you asking me, or you? - Both? - Well, whether or not I think she's the one doesn't matter. The only opinion that matters is yours. - We have to send all of these back in for approval. - Yes. - That one, this one. - Okay. - Hi! Surprise! Mr. McAwesome, reporting for duty. - Thank you. You're wonderful for bringing that, I appreciate it. - Do you have any toys here like my mom's office? - No, I wish. - But we do have a model of the light rail. You want to see? Yeah? Okay, let's go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - She's too much. - She's amazing. Hi. - Hey there, I'm glad you're here. Cause I keep thinking about your short. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, I have a few notes. - Oh, really? - No, I don't. But I do have a thought here. You said it's a story about courage, right? - I did. - Isn't love the most perfect motivator for courage? - I mean, it's a little limited, don't you think? People can be brave for a lot of reasons. - I don't know. The world is a lot less scary when no matter where you land, you always know where you belong. And that helps you take bigger chances, that gives you something to fight for. Do you know what I mean? - No. To be honest, I don't think I've ever felt that. - Eric. - Hey! - Sorry. Travel wrapped early, so I just hopped a flight so I could make our phone date a real date. - Yes, alright, let me see-- - Hey. - If we can get a sitter, maybe we can-- - I'll take Owen. - Oh, I'm sorry, Kate, this is Bianca, Bianca, this is Kate. - Uh, hi. - Oh, you're Sophia's mom. - Yeah. - Hi. It's so nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Are you sure? - Sophia would be thrilled. - Okay, oh my gosh, thank you. We'll drop him off on the way to dinner. - Okay. That's great. That's great, that's great. So great. So I'll just see you two lovebirds later? - On the way to dinner, thank you. - On the way to dinner, that's right. Okay, Sophia! Which one do you think is the solid? - Solid. - Yes, very good. - Hey guys! - Ah! - Daddy! - Hey! - Hi. What's up, kiddo? Oh, so good to see you. - How was Bali? - It was unbelievable. Wait 'til you see the shots I got. The temples, the beaches, the sunsets. The music. That's yours. - Thanks, Dad. - Of course. - Yes, thank you so much for that. That is gonna be the gift that's gonna keep on giving. - Well, it's a good thing that I got you this rare gourmet coffee blend to help power you through. - It is a great thing! Ah, coffee. Let me see the pictures. Oh, this smells so good. Thank you, thank you so much for this. - You're welcome. I've got so many good shots. - Oh, I love that. - Dad, there is someone very important I would like you to meet. - Oh, yes. The famous Bruce. Hi, Bruce. Oh, no, the pleasure is all mine, buddy. - I'm gonna go take him to the backyard. - Okay. - Okay. - Come on, Bruce. - Have fun, sweetie. - Okay. Bye, Bruce. - So is it okay if I take Sophia to my place tonight? - No, actually. Cause Owen's coming over tonight. - Who? - The little boy, Owen, that we share the dog with. His dad's going on a date, so I agreed to watch him. - Oh, so the kids are friends. - Best friends. We go to the park, we go hiking, which I gotta say, is not Eric's strong suit. - Who's Eric? - Owen's dad. Oh! He totally roped me into joining the PTA. - You? How? - Well, he wanted Bruce to go to obedience school, so we made a deal. I get the choose the school, if I volunteer. And I chose this like fuzzy, you know, feeling-sy place, and I wish you could've seen his face when he walked through the door. It was... Um, funny. It was funny. - You like him! - No, I do not. He-- - Kate Healy, I have known you-- - He is such a nice guy! - Since the seventh grade. - Okay, you think you know me. - You are smitten right now. - What? He has a girlfriend! - Yeah, and you are watching his kid so he can go out on a date? - So, we just throw them? - Yeah, well, at the canvas ideally. - And we won't get in trouble? - Anything above the tarp is fair game. Ready? One, two, three! - Welcome home. That's nice. - So do you remember that old married couple in the Chicago office I told you about? - Yeah, the one who they are always fighting with each other? - Yes. Larry, enough with the printing already. Rhonda, you know I can't concentrate without a hard copy. - I'm so glad we don't get under each other's skin like that. - So the other night, I forgot my keys at the office. So I had to double back, and there was Larry and Rhonda, slow dancing in the office. He's cracking jokes in her ear, and she's laughing and laughing. - Larry and Rhonda. - Larry, Rhonda. - See, that goes to show you, you just don't know what's underneath the surface there. - Yeah, maybe. Or maybe I just had the wrong idea. - What do you mean? - I don't know. I thought their bickering was the spark fizzling out but maybe it was more than irritation. See, they hold each other to their best selves. Even when they drive each other crazy, and that's real connection. And I think maybe that's real love. And maybe I just didn't get it before. - We don't have that, do we? - I'm sorry. I was excited to have the next steps talk with you, because you're a great guy. And I felt like I was checking the next relationship boxes but-- - To be honest, I'm relieved. For that every time I started thinking about the next step conversation, I just went blank. And I don't know, that's not a good sign. - So why don't we just find somebody who makes us crazy, is this how this works now? - Maybe not crazy. Maybe just passionate. - Yeah. I like that, passionate. - Hey, come on in. How was your date? - It was, uh, you're covered in paint. - Oh, yeah. Just a painting experiment gone awry. What? - Nothing, nothing. I'm glad you had a good time tonight. - Yeah. No, we did. Come on. Hey, buddy. - I hope you're doing okay, pal. - Hi, buddy. Here, his shoes. - Hey. Thanks for calling me back. - I think I got so focused on how to share, that I forgot we need to choose one home. - As fun as this is, it can't be forever, right? - Right. - I mean, in theory, it could be. It seems like Bruce will have a happy home either way. So as a representative of the shelter, there's no problem on our end. - I'm sensing a but. - Look, I can't tell you what to do. My job is to look after Bruce, but if it were me, it would only get harder to say goodbye the longer I had with him. It might be better to just rip the bandaid off, so to speak. - I understand. Thank you. - Thank you. - How's the world's best dog doing? - He learned two new tricks this week. - He's a good boy. - The best boy. - Hey, Owen. If Bruce lives with me, I promise, I'll still share him with you. - Oh. Okay, but, if he lives with me, I'll still share him with you too. - Owen, keep him on the leash, bud! - Okay, Dad! Hi, Sophia. - Hey! - Ah. Sorry we're late. - Mm, no worries. I got here a little early anyway. I'm just trying to clear my head. You have news? - What? - You're never late. - Nothing, it's nothing. - Spill it. - Okay. It's a job opportunity, at a housing advocacy group. - That's amazing! Did you apply? - No. - Why? Isn't that your dream job? - There's just been a lot of change this month. With Bruce, and Bianca and I breaking up. - Yeah. I mean, yeah, you did? Oh, I'm really sorry to hear about that. That's very rough. That's a... - Carla? - Yeah, yep. But I am, I'm sorry though. - Yeah? - Yeah. So, this job. - Yeah, this job. - Yeah. - It'd also be a pretty big career pivot on paper. - Oh, nonsense. You've been in government for years. All you have to do is just, you know, get creative, and then show them how passionate you are about this. Right? - Those are not fireflies. - Oh, no. My boss reviewed my short, and he told me that my ending was uninspired, so I'm trying to get out of my head, and get into my heart, so, hence that. - Can you get a sitter tomorrow? - I think so. Liam's back, maybe he could watch him. Why? - I have an idea. Something that might help give you some perspective. - Oh. Thank you, I'm all ears. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. If we're trying to get you out of your head, I think it should be a surprise. What do you say? You game? - Why do you want to help me? - We might as well have each other's backs right now. - Yeah. Yeah. I'm game. - Okay. He gets three stories. The last one you could read, it could be a calm one, he gets super amped up if you read anything that's like, a superhero, or space, or... - You look like a princess. - Thank you. - Alright, you two kids come with me. It's dinner time. And you kids have fun. - Thank you. - I should've known you'd take get some perspective literally. - A little birdie named Carla told me that you were a bit of an astronomy geek. - Oh, no. You hit it out of the park. I have been dying to come here. But it's always been too late for Sophia, past her bedtime. - Oh, sure. Well now we're grown ups, with a sitter. - Look at us! - Wow. - Look at us. - Wow. - I know, right? - We're doing it. - Look at this. - This is fantastic, and laminated. - Oh, yeah. - Very nice. - I love the myth about that star and that star once being a peasant and princess who fell in love. - And let me guess, they lived happily ever after. - Kind of. - Mhm. - More of a Romeo and Juliet sort of thing where they put this gigantic celestial river between the two of them, otherwise known as-- - The Milky Way. - Milky Way. - Man. Dating is hard everywhere. Stars. They're just like us. But that's not the end of the story. - Oh, no. One night a year, the stars align just so to create a bridge to reunite them. That's my favorite story. - That's your favorite? It's so sad! - What? Oh no. It's hopeful. - Hopeful? Please, they're two star-crossed lovers. - I saw what you did there, good pun. - Mhm, spend eternity pining for the one person they can't have. There are plenty of stars in the sky, it's like come on, move it along, folks. - No, but it's hopeful, because to never experience a love that big is far worse than the pain of missing someone. It doesn't get more romantic than that. - What would they be missing out on? - Well, for one, she's one of the top five brightest stars in the sky. So, I mean, what guy in his right mind is gonna pass that up? - What about her? - Passion. Satisfaction knowing that she didn't settle, and assurance. - Assurance. What assurance? They can't even be together. - How many people can say, even if it's for one night a year, that in that moment, they were right where they were supposed to be? Full disclosure. I didn't get to go grocery shopping like I had planned, and so our menu tonight is 87% kid friendly. - Fantastic. What do you got? - Oh, I got cheese puffs. - Yeah! - I have a bottle of wine labeled "red". - Red. - Yes. Definitely adult approved. Now this vintage, I've been told pairs very well with the PB&-- - You had me at cheese puff. Cheese puffs make everything better. - Really, cheese puffs? - Mhm. - Anything could've happened tonight, but as long as it ended with cheese puffs, all's well that ends well? - That's right. - Cheese puff. - Mhm. Can I say something awkward? - That seems on brand. - Carla told me about your wife. I had no idea, and I just wanted to say I'm so sorry. - Well, thank you. She was amazing. I can't help but think how proud she would be of what Owen and I have built since. - I didn't know her, but I can't imagine she wouldn't be. - Your turn. - For what? - Sophia's dad. What happened there? - Oh. I mean, nothing dramatic. Well, we met in high school, got married way too young. We should've known from the beginning. Beginning. - What's wrong? - I don't need a new end, I need a new beginning. - What do you mean? - My short. I don't need a new end, I need a new beginning. I gotta go. - Mission accomplished, let's go! - Okay, cool. - Let's go, let's go. Did you get it? Oh, okay. - Hey, team! - Oh, come on, Kate! - Okay, sorry. Habit. I've been up all night writing a new beginning for our short. - Beginning? - Beginning? - And a new ending, and drum roll please... It's a romance now. - Yes! Are you serious? Is she serious? - Nobody move, or we'll all wake up. - You were right. It's all there, I just need your brilliant minds to bring it to life, so can we do this? - Yes, we can do it. - Okay, thank you guys. And I'll see you later. Okay. - Yes! We got it. - Finally, oh my goodness. Yes, finally. - Down and back. Perfect. Now let's talk about sealant. - Okay. - Ugh. - Kate. What are you doing here? - I'm teaching Susan about sealant. - Oh. Go home and finish your short. - But I-- - Go. - But-- - No buts about it! You're not welcome here until your short's finished. - You're not the boss of me! - No, but as president of the PTA, my name is on that funnel cake machine lease. - You wouldn't. - No, but I will make sure that there is an unlimited supply of funnel cake waiting for someone who may happen to have a finished short. - Fine! - Maybe dial back the caffeine a little? - Never! Sophia! - At an angle, make it like the wind's blowing it? - Yeah, I think that's great, and the trees. - Yep, can do that too. - That looks good. - Yeah, I like that. Just there's that one frame and when you get to the-- - You already did your job, now let us do ours! Thank you. - Okay, great. - Oh, excellent. These are for "Bowl and Roll". - Hi. - Hey, how's it going? - Good, we're just about to go paint some more, and then I think we're set. - Pardon me. Hey, did you finish? - No, I just wanted to-- - Sorry. - Sorry! - Bye. - Hi. I had a million more cups of coffee, take that! And now my team has taken over, and I kind of need something to do. I can't let this energy go to waste, so, I took the liberty of making you a cover letter. No excuses. Apply to the job already, would ya? - What did she do? - Aw. You need to apply for this job already. - I'm gonna watch it again. - Okay. - Wow. I did not think that I was gonna make it. - You did make it. - Right? - What's that? - We've done that, I wanna do that one. - Yeah. - Did we get to do that? - Don't worry about it! You're like, uh-- - Hey, Owen! You want to do the ring toss with me? - Oh, yeah! - That video. - I know, I know. - That was incredible. Thank you. - Well, it's the least I could do. - I actually think it was the literal most you could do. Hey. - Hey. - Can I take you out? A real date, no kids. I mean, maybe Bruce could come. Okay, look, I don't want to make things weird. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. I think that would be okay. - Okay. Great. - Yes! - Yay! - Hey! - You gotta say it. - You were right about the theme, it worked. - Yeah! - Now, hey. Do you think since we did the carnival today, it would be nice if we could have Bruce for one more day? - You know what? Rules are rules, buddy. Especially when they're laminated. - Okay. Hey. I had fun with you today. - Yeah, it was a great day. Thank you. - Sweet dreams. - Good night. Uh, no, no, no. We have the dog. You swore the PowerPoint madness would end. - Hey buddy. What's that? - As you know-- - We are sharing world's best dog. - We both love Bruce so much! - And we don't want to give him up. So we have a plan. - Okay. Alright. Show me this plan. - Uh huh. Did you get an adorable ambush this morning? Or was that just me? - No. Well, yes. Sophia gave me another one of her PowerPoint presentations. - Oh, I didn't. Mine was not that sophisticated. But still, very impressed. It was a masterfully coordinated-- - Eric. - Oh. - I'm not a rules person, but I have had one rule. Which is not to date while Sophia's a kid because I didn't want her to get attached to someone who wasn't gonna stick around. And I promised myself that when I did date, I would be so careful and so sure-- - We're gonna take it slow. We're gonna make it very clear with the kids. - Did you and I get the same pitch this morning? Our kids want us to just mosey on down to the courthouse, and get hitched, and we haven't even gone on a first date yet. It's too fast. - I know how I feel about you, and I know I haven't felt that way in a long time. - Eric. The look on her face when she was so sure that you and I being together would solve everything... I can risk my heart, but not hers. I just think we should, you know, take a break for now, and just let the kids be friends. - Owen. We gotta go, buddy. - Eric, I'm so sorry. - No. It's okay. You're a good mom. I get it. - Hey! Who wants ice cream? - You want ice cream? - This is a real departure for you. - I know. - I mean, I usually-- - I know. - Love your work but-- - I don't know what I was thinking-- - This has far exceeded anything we imagined. - What? - We love it. I might be a little biased, but I've seen the other submissions, and I'd make sure you have the first weekend in June open. - Really? - In my opinion, you're a shoe in for the Georgia Animation Festival. I think you're gonna blow the judges away. - Hi, Bruce. Come on. Alright. Come on, Bruce. - I will find you, my sun and stars, no matter how far. - Hi, Liam. - Hi. So the digital copy of the festival invitations are in your inbox. And I had my assistant print some on some fancy paper for you. - Thank you. - Oh boy, what happened? - I don't know what you're talking about. - With dog dad. - Yeah, lady, what, you've known him for like five seconds, but sure. He's definitely the one. Hey! - Alright. - Come on, I was watching that. - Look. I know we're exes, but I like to think that we're friends, good friends. What did he do? - Nothing. Nothing. I mean, he's amazing. - So? - So, I can't do it to Sophia, okay? I can't risk hurting her. - Look, we raised a resilient, loving, and smart kid. Sometimes too smart. But I don't think that's what you're worried about here, no offense. - I don't know why I'm so scared. - I do. You've never been in grown up love. I'm serious. We started dating when we were what, 17? You have not been swept off your feet as an adult. And that is an entirely different, exhilarating, and terrifying experience. - What if I'm no good at it? - Nobody's good at it. - Okay, well, I mean, like what if we break up? I mean, what about the kids? And Bruce, it's just, it's such a bad plan. - Yeah but, you can't plan this stuff out. Life likes to take a hammer to the best laid plans. But the Kate Healy that I know would take all those little pieces, and would string them together, and tell a bigger story. And she sees what could be, even when other people can't. Isn't what they pay you the big bucks for over at that studio? - Yeah. You know, you've come a long way since the angsty teenager I met. - Yeah, whatever. - Whatever. - You better do what makes you happy though, cause I don't have a lot of those speeches in me. - You're late. - Sorry. Super serious game of tetherball. - Today, we have a super secret mission. - I love super secret missions. - Take this invitation, tell your dad it's from my mom. Super brother, do you accept this mission? - I can do this. - Kate. - It's me. - What are you doing here? - Hi. Here. It's for my short, they're showing it at an animation festival, and I just wanted to invite you guys. - I know. - You have two. - Owen just gave me one. - But I didn't-- - Abort, abort! Go, go, go! - Our kids. - Well, I can't turn down two invitations, now can I? - Great. Great. So I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah, great. - Awesome, cool. I'm gonna see you there? - Yeah. - Yep. - That's it. Yeah, here you go. See? Easy peasy. - You look beautiful. - Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go. - Um, I think we're in here. This is us, we're right here. - Welcome to the animated short film competition. This year's nominees will compete for a chance to submit for the Academy Awards "Animated Short" category. Please stay seated after our presentation for a Q&A with our creators. Enjoy. - I'd like to turn the discussion over to Kate Healy's charming short, Light The Way. You know, it's a hard thing to make an audience believe in love again in eight minutes or less. - Well. You can thank my team for that one. Honestly, I was completely against a romantic ending for this short. - Really? Well, what made you change your mind? - Well, when we first started working on the project, I had written love off as a cliche. I was pretty sure that I had been there, seen the trailer, wasn't missing much. You know what I mean? But then someone very important to me showed me just what I was missing. Oh. It can shake parts of you awake that you thought you would have to tuck away forever. Because love is one of the only ways that we show each other that we belong. And everybody deserves to belong. Dramatic fireflies, shelter dogs, maybe even me. - Mom. - Yeah. - I'm gonna go show Owen your award. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - Congrats on the Grand Jury Prize. Your short was incredible. - You liked it? - No, I loved it. I had an interview with the affordable housing advocacy group yesterday, and I have a follow up next week. - Of course you do. Tell me everything. - First thing they asked about was my very creative cover letter. So thank you. So I told them that, long story short, I met this infuriatingly zany, insanely talented woman who reminded me that life was way too short to waste any time not doing what you love. - She sounds like a wise woman. Let's say, hypothetically, this wise woman decided that she didn't know everything. - Okay. - And, hypothetically, dinner doesn't sound like Armageddon. - No. Stop. One date would not be the end of the world? - Mm, no. I think it actually might be nice. - So, what are we gonna do with this dog? - I don't know. - I cannot, in good conscience, leave this dog with some wild, unruly-- - Unruly? - Oh, yeah. - Well then I can't leave the dog with some tyrant who's just gonna break his spirit and we're never gonna... Hi, buddy. Hi. Alright guys, let's go home. Right, Bruce? Let's go home. Yeah!
