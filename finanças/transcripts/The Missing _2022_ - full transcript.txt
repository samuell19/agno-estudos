Hey, baby, I'm almost ready. About how long do you think it'll take you. Are you okay? I didn't get it. Those rat bastards gave the account. To Newman right under my nose. That's just part of the game. You lost accounts before. So now you're keeping a tally of my failures? You know, that's not what I meant. Look! What do you say we stay in tonight, hmm? We can chill at home. I can cook up a little something. It's your fault. It's your fault... all of it. I should have been focusing on work instead of worrying about planning your stupid birthday weekend. So selfish. More of a bill than a wife. Maurice, I didn't ask for any of this. None of it. You drain me. You know that. That's why I've always avoided women like you. Women like me? Yeah. Women like you. What exactly do you mean by that? It means you're basic Raina because you had nothing when I found you. I had nothing. You were a waitress. A bum. I gave up a lot to be with you, Maurice. Oh, yeah? Yeah? What did you give up to be with me, huh? You had no family, hardly any friends. What you give up to be with me. I saved you from your miserable life. I was your lifeline. How could you treat me like this? I have been with you through everything, Maurice. Everything. So now you're doing me a favor? Maurice, I don't understand. What is this all about? Maybe this is about you hiding things. You trying to fix me. Honey, I'm not trying to fix anything. Yeah. I don't understand why... Why did I find this? A therapist, a psychiatrist. Maybe it's because I... I don't want to hear it. Don't open your mouth. Maurice. Don't back away from me. Come here. Don't make me! Don't make me chase you! Get your... Come here! Come here! Come here! Open this door! You locked the God damned door didn't you? Open this door Raina Raina, open the door! I wasn't trying to upset you. I never said. I just want to talk. I just want to talk. Open the door. You don't think I can knock the door off the hinges? Huh? You're not the man I married Maurice. You haven't been for a long time. And no matter how hard I try, it doesn't matter. Okay, I'm counting to three, and if you don't open this door... Open the door! You hear me? You unappreciative bitch. You know what? I see now why your mother abandoned you? I see now why. One. Two... I'm serious. Enough is enough Maurice. I can't take this any more. I don't want to fight either. Okay. No. No baby I don't want to fight anymore, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know you're scared. Okay? I'm scared too... of losing you. We can do therapy. You weren't wrong for wanting to try. How about that? Can we do that maybe?, Raina? Look, I know I have a problem, but I'm working on it, you know that baby. Yeah? I'm going to stop drinking, and I'm going to control my anger. I just want to have a good weekend. It's your birthday Baby. I don't want to fight, I want to make love. Let's start with that, okay? Can we do that birthday girl? Open the door. No more fighting. I'm sorry. Come here. I love you. I'm sorry, come here birthday girl. Come here! Come here. Where you going huh? Look at you. Not playin' with you. You stay there for a while. Stay there for a while. Look at you. Yeah. Keep crawlin'. Keep crying. Come Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Get up. Get up. Come here, come here. Where are you going? You're mine. You aint' goin' nowhere. Nowhere. You think you... I wish you would. Come here! Babe? Babe. Raina! No. No. Damn! Aaagh! Oh fuck! Hello? Oh, yeah, I'll take it. Perfect. Hi sweetie. Hi Gail. Hi Miracle. I saw someone came to look at this place earlier and I wanted to ask if you... Dani, sweetie we've been through this before. I can't keep this place tenant free forever. God knows we need the business. Don't we? Oh, he's just the sweetest. Look at those lips. What are you doing? Rent's not due till the first of the month. You're fine. It's for this place. I'd like it to remain tenant free a little longer. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I'll get you a key. Thanks. Jimmy, I'm on my way. Yes. Yes. I want the shift. Okay. All right. See you soon. Bye. Where's Ms. Mae? I don't know. Late. Late? And you are? Five minutes, Jimmy. Okay. All right. Just go. I'll sign. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. It's almost nap time. So... Okay. This is her diaper bag. I love you. See you later, okay? Love you. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Dani? Oh my God! Ah, thank you, Jimmy. That looks good. Just the way you just go over questions. Hey ladies. One for you, and one for you. Anything else? Hey Carmen. Coffee. Thank you. And I did the filters the way Dani likes it. Oh, Eli. I'm sure she appreciates it. No problem, my pleasure. Now look at you. Now look at you. God, you were nothing before me. You're still nothing. I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. All you do is whine all day. Do you think I deserve that? Hey, do you think I deserve that? I do nothing. I swear to God I'm gonna beat the shit out of you. You're not good at that. I bet that woke you up, didn't it? But you want to spend my money? Look at me. I'm going to hit you. Stop crying. I'm going down. Is that what you wanted? I don't deserve that. No, you don't deserve. No, I don't. Look at yourself. Cover up. Do you want everyone looking at you like that? It's not like that. You dress like a whore. I think we're ready to order. I'm sorry. I'll be right back. Been here before you left and thought, yeah, this is good. This is good. Ow! Okay. Unreal. Coffee? We're good here, sweetheart. I was actually speaking to the young lady. She doesn't want any more coffee. Pour the coffee. Sure. Okay. So you be careful because this is hot, straight out of the kitchen. Thank you. And one for you. Yeah. Great. What are you doing? I am so sorry. Jesus Christ! Carmen! Fix that. Dani, off the floor. It's okay. Sit. I'll stand. So what, you going to fire me? Jesus, Dani. It was an accident. An accident, huh? Grits in his lap. I don't know. Maybe I'm a clutz. I thought you wanted these shifts. God, I do. Then act like it. My God. What the hell did you want me to do? That guy was being a jackass. I hired you to be a waitress. Not security, Dani. I need my customers. Minus the third degree burns. Got it, man. I got it. All right. I'm sorry. Jesus. I'm sending you home. No. Yes. No. Jimmy, you know that I need the job. You know I need the money and it's busy out there. You need me. I was wrong. We got it. Here. Don't look at me like that. You've been watching all these burglaries on the news. You can't be too careful around here. Take it. I didn't earn that. Come on. I see you. You working hard. You trying to do the best you can. Go on. We respect that. I know you like being mysterious and all and staying to yourself, taking care of your daughter and everything. Now I didn't say nothing when you requested to be paid under the table. I worry about you. So what's up, you stalking me? Stalking you? I'm your friend. Come on. I may not know all the reasons why you done showed up in our town, but I do know when a good waitress needs a break. Now come on, take it. I can't Jimmy. Look, I was barely here for two hours. You know what? Look, I was barely here for two hours. Math always been my worst subject. Come on. What? All right, Jimmy. Thank you. Thank you. Dani. Hey, you okay? Dude, that guy was being a total jerk. Yeah, he was. Is he okay? Define okay. Girl, why ain't no man's crotch ever safe around you? That's what I do. Stay. No seriously stay. You know how Jimmy is. He'll calm down. Nah, Carmen, I think it was a sign. I think a day off would do me some good. Yeah? All right. Fine. Well, listen, everybody's coming to my place later on tonight. Think of it as a birthday party for yourself. Eli's going to be there. Oh my God. You know. Besides that dude's name sucks. - It does not. - It does He likes you. Okay. And I think sometimes he actually follows you home to make sure that you got in safely. Okay. Now that's creepy. I think it's kind of sweet. Which is why you should also bring Miracle tonight so that way she can finally meet her future step-daddy, because that baby needs a step-daddy. I'm going to ignore you right now. Well then you're ignoring what you need. Oh, come on Dani, are we really that bad? God Carmen, you know it's not like that. I just need to stay focused. I got a plan, remember? Yeah. I know about the plan and the house. - 1425 Summerset. - 1425 Summerset. I am almost there, Carmen. And you also deserve to have a little happiness along the way. Come on, we all do. You think I'm going to be working here forever? I know you won't. All right. Then come. Man, Carmen. Girl, we live in the same building. You know what? You're coming. You are. You're coming. You know what? You're coming. Believe it or not, I am happy. Happiest I've been in a long time. We'll see. I'll catch you later. Okay? - You better. - Maybe. Don't make me come knock at your door. Thank you. Hi. We've seen a lot more of you lately. I hope that's not a bad thing. Okay. Just this and... All right. There we go. And this too. Could you split it evenly in all the accounts? Same as usual. Thanks. You are so stupid. Okay. All right, bye. Hey, how can I help you? Hello, I got off work early and figured I'd come pick up my Miracle. That's sweet, but you know Miracle isn't here today. No, really Ms. Mae. I need you to go get my daughter. Dani, Miracle's not here. I don't understand because I dropped her off just a few hours ago. Oh my God. I need to get my daughter. Excuse me. Oh, no, no. You can't come back here. You'll wake my babies up. Okay? I'll check for you and you stay right here and I'll be right back. But you cannot come in here. Okay. Could you hurry, please? What's going on? Dani thinks that her baby is here. Mama, look at her. Excuse me. You cannot come in here. I will burn this raggedy building down if you don't get your ass out of my way. Mama. Call the police. The police are on the way. Look, where is Miracle? I know she's here. I'm not leaving without my daughter. We'll see. Oh, we gonna see. I'm sorry. You're sure? And she said, she dropped your daughter off here this morning. Is that right? And it's never on Fridays. That's been that way for like a month now. It's always the quiet ones. So it's just you two here, right? Yes. Just her and I. And I don't just work here. I live here. I cannot have this kind of drama around my house. Mama, they ain't going to do nothing. Who talking to you? Can you just get her away from here please? I'm sorry about the baby. All right. Thank you. Ma'am. Look! I have a daughter. She was wearing a pink onesie. Has big brown eyes. I have pictures. Ma'am I need you to calm down. No, please find my baby. Someone has my baby. Why isn't someone looking for my baby? Ma'am, we will get to the bottom of this. Okay? You need to calm down. Oh, she's working with him. Can't you see? She's working with him. Working with who? My ex-husband. It was him. It was him. I know it. All right. I'm going to meet you at the station. No, detective, please. Please find my baby. Please. Danielle Hill. Can I call you Dani? Or do you prefer Raina Sidner? Or maybe there's another name you prefer? Wow. It's your birthday? Been a while since I've arrested somebody on their birthday. But lying to an officer, that's a crime, even on birthdays. I'm sure you knew that. We're wasting time. Petty theft, insufficient funds. Real basic bitch. I'm not that person anymore. That was years ago. It was. See, that's why I'm confused. Why now? Why now what? The break-ins? Makes sense. I mean, it's easy to hide in a small town, right? Fake name. No social media. You've been here a good little while and you stayed off the radar? Not bad. Oh, okay. You're staying at that apartment complex off Shaw. The one that doesn't check credit. I mean, that's not sketchy at all. Right? Don't you think it's a coincidence that the break-ins started when you got to town? Are you serious? Dead serious. Why did you come to our town? Because you don't have any ties here and it doesn't seem to fit a person like you. Oh my God. Here we go again. A person like me. Now, what the hell does that mean? It means answer the question. Why is that important to you? My daughter is missing. It's not. Just nosy, I guess. But here's an important question. What were you doing at that daycare? Like I already told you that someone took my daughter. Maurice Sidner. You find him, you'll find my daughter. Right? The abusive husband. We're looking into that. Good. You know, I'm a pretty good judge of character. You don't strike me as a victim type. Why aren't you taking this seriously? I am taking this very seriously, but I am also good at my job. Oh honey. The only thing that you are good at is slowing things down. The only person slowing things down right now is you. We have four officers out there right now looking for your daughter. Wow. Four officers. Great. We are a small but efficient department, Ms. Sidner. All right, look, let's just take it from the beginning. All right. The daycare says that you don't normally bring your daughter in on Fridays. Now, if that's the case, why were you there? My boss offered me an extra shift. So I took it. You needed the money? Yes. That's funny. Because we pulled your bank accounts. You have over $160,000 spread across four accounts, three in your daughter's name. Now you want to tell me what a waitress is doing with that kind of money. It's not what you think. I'm listening. I dropped my daughter off at daycare and now she's missing. We checked the logs. You didn't sign in. That's because the bitch at the counter said she would do it for me. This is the one with the neck tattoos, right? The woman you said you never saw before and you just trusted her with your kid? I was in a rush. Yes. But I tell you what, I did look into that and they didn't hire anybody new Ms. Sidner. That's not my name. And how the hell would I know? Maybe it was their first day. Do you think that I am lying? No. But you are not telling me everything. Do you owe somebody money? Maybe a drug deal gone wrong. I am not a criminal. Maybe, but you are a suspect. How do I know you're not involved in this? I mean maybe you broke into that daycare in order to pay off a debt in exchange for your daughter's return. Has anybody blackmailed you? Are you being propositioned? The only thing that makes sense is that my ex-husband Maurice Sidner took my daughter. Now you can do whatever the hell you want to do with me, but please, please, I am begging you to find my daughter. So you don't think she's responsible for the break ins? I don't know, but she's hiding something. Well find out. You got something on the ex. They're still married. He's clean. No criminal record. And get this, he's here. Now? Yeah. Mr. Sidner. Where is she? My wife. One of you called me with news about my wife being arrested. I want her released right now. Sir. I'm going to need you to calm down. Okay. And you expect me to calm down? Is this how you do business here? Because I am going to have a field day suing your asses. Mr. Sidner. And you want me to calm down? How about showing me the respect I deserve? What is this about? No. Where is she? For what? What's going on? No, we're not here to help you figure out jack shit. I'm not only her husband, I'm an attorney. Her attorney. As her attorney, I have the right to know why my client is being held. I want to speak to her. Now. Right this way, sir. I'm not playing with you. I'm not playing with you. Can't breathe, can you? See you me made me do this. Wake up. Happy birthday, baby. At least you still look good. Asshole didn't even bother to ask us to take her out of the handcuffs. Maybe he knows something we don't. Or maybe it's the other way around. I can explain. Is she mine? The baby that you had and didn't bother to tell me, is she mine? You lost a whole baby and got yourself locked up. My God, you are just like your mother. If you had anything to do with this, I- Me? If it was up to me that bastard baby would be put up for adoption. And don't think for one second you're going to trap me into paying you child support. What? You going to do something? Please, do. I dare you. Maurice, I'm sorry, but this isn't about us right now. Our babe... Yes, your daughter is out there alone and she needs our help. Help? Did you think I came here to help you? No. No, see, I came here to end you. Did you think you could run forever? Maurice, I told you I'm sorry, but Miracle needs us. Detective. Miracle. You named the baby Miracle. With you for a mother, she's more like cursed. Find her a public defender. She can't afford me. You're letting me go? For now, but I'm going to hold that little incident in the daycare over your head, and just in case you try to skip town. Okay. Is there any update on Miracle? For now, that's all I care about. Anything? I thought you said Maurice Sidner was your ex-husband? It's complicated, and right now it doesn't matter. It matters. You have a criminal record, pending charges and are a suspect in a string of burglaries. It matters, especially if he's the father. Look, when there's no custody agreement between two parents, then the parent who has possession of the child is the custodial guardian. Doesn't matter what you say that he did to you, you never reported it to the police. He just threatened me in your interrogation room. Just now, he said he would end me. My God, didn't you hear any of that shit behind that mirror that you were looking at? That is how this thing works, isn't it? We are not allowed to listen in on conversations with your lawyer. My lawyer? I never did anything wrong. I left him to protect her. That's why I had the money in the bank. I took it from my husband so that I could hide it until I knew we were safe. That's why I didn't leave this State to just make sure that something like this never happened. I'm sorry, but this is procedure when a child is missing. There's nothing I can do. Now we have to act. Ma'am? She's not missing. Call it off and stop looking for her. I'm not going to file a report. Look, I know what you are thinking, but you cannot find that child on your own, Mrs. Sidner. You got to fight this out in court. I said that she is not missing. Are you going to let me go? Are you sure you want to do this? Wouldn't you do anything you had to protect. She's not missing. Am I free to leave? Are you sure you want to do this? I have no choice. Then you are free to go. Why are you still here? Price? She switched the plates on the Jeep, and she pays for everything in cash. There is a reason she is living off the grid, Captain. Go home. All right, look at this. Don't you think that's odd? Doesn't surprise me. Then we're, obviously, not looking at the same picture. That's the problem, Price, you never get the picture. A traumatic past isn't a reason to commit crimes. It's a reason to go to therapy. You don't find it curious that he never bothers to divorce her or report the money missing? Price. To let things go. Don't! Don't what? Be you right now. I know what you're thinking. Just look again, because she is not happy, despite the multiple homes and the cars, she's terrified. And that woman that I was interrogating, she knew she was being hunted. I don't like it when you get like this. That is why he did not divorce her or report the money, because it is worth it to him to know the psychological damage that he is doing to her. You're not going. I'll have my overtime request on your desk in the morning. Carmen and her parties. Good old, Carmen. Twice in one day? To what do I owe the pleasure? I actually have to ask you a question. Go ahead. I actually have to ask you a question. Know everyone, right? I've lived here all my life. Okay. So there's a young black girl with a tattoo, a few stars on the right side of her neck. Town's not that's small, sweetheart. No one like that, doesn't sound remotely familiar. What about a man? Tall, clean, cut, about my complexion, driving maybe a fancy car or a Tahoe? No. No one like that's been here. Okay. Well, if you do see someone- I'll let you know. Bye, babe. All right, thanks Gayle. Yes. Yeah, you made it. You made it! Come here, come here, come here. Oh, but I don't know what you're wearing. But girl, you made it. I'm not staying anyway. I need to ask you something. All right sure, sweetie. But you know Eli's going to be here soon. Sure hate I'll have to miss him. All right, smart ass. What's this question you got to ask me? And oh girl, I am so happy that you did not bring that pretty little baby of yours because look around, you see the kind of party that's happening up in here. I do, I do. All right, listen. Do you know a young black girl with stars tattooed on her neck? That's an odd question. Do you know her? No, but you know what, it's only one place in this town where you can get a tat at. It's a little small spot over on Moye Row, so if she's from around here that's where she went. Okay. You know where that's at? No, no, I don't but I'll find it. Wait, girl, you're thinking about getting a tat? No. Listen, one more thing. Do you have keys to the diner? Mm-hmm. Look, I left out of there so fast the other day that I forgot something in the break room. Oh. Oh, you need them right now? Well I'm not going to work again until Monday, so if you don't mind. All right, well listen, I just need you to loosen up. Have a drink. I'll be back. Relax. Oh goodness, no. There ain't no party here, buddy. Okay. Here you go. You are a lifesaver. Mm-hmm. I know. Bring it in. Thank you. Oh my God! Damn. Who are you? What are you doing here? I need to talk to Maurice Sidner. No, no. You've got to go now. You can't be- Baby. I got this. Get in the house. Get your ass in the house. Can I get you something to drink? No, I won't be staying long. Please have a seat. You sure I can't get you something to drink? I mean, you're a long way from Mayberry, Detective. Look, I need to talk to you about your wife. I meant it, I'm done with that. She's a thief and a liar. Do you know how much of my money that bitch stole? Nah, she gets what she deserves. And what about the baby? The baby. You know I'm starting to think that there isn't a baby. And if there is, how do I even know that the baby's mine? Is that why you're here, the baby? Your wife claims that the baby isn't missing. Okay, then there you go. No, I don't believe that. What do you believe, Detective? You know, I don't know what to believe when it comes to your wife. Because why would a woman with so much money, choose to live like she does? And why would a woman who clearly loves her child lie and say that the child is missing? You are asking the wrong person, Detective. Actually you are the only person I can ask. Look, I need your permission to continue the search. What? If you say that Miracle is missing, we can continue our search. Now you're legally the child's father so you can still make the call. Oh, stop, stop. I understand exactly how this works. I'm sorry. I don't want any part of this. I can't help you. I should have listened to my gut and ignored my phone when your department called me. Wow. Well you had amazing foresight, Mr. Sidner, absolutely amazing. Tell me, did you foresee that nasty bruise on your girlfriend's shoulder? Hey, maybe I should use my foresight and call somebody about that. I think we're done here. I told you I wouldn't be here for long. We simple folk in Mayberry we normally like to be home before the street lights come on. Let's get you home then. You have a nice night, Mr. Sidner. Dani, what are you doing? I didn't know anyone was here. Well, you not noticing me isn't a big surprise. Sorry. All right, man, I got to go. Dani, you never said what you were doing here. You never told me what you're doing here. You never asked. Come on, ask and I'll tell you. I'm leaving. I have a cousin that works at the Sheriff's office. Said that someone from the diner was hauled in for all these burglaries that's been happening. And? Said that a woman said that her daughter was missing. What the hell does that have to do with me? I'm thinking my cousin was talking about you. Does it look like I'm in jail to you, Eli? No. It doesn't look like you in jail, Dani. I just want to make sure that you're okay. Dani, is your little girl missing? I am not doing this. Get your damn hands off me. So what are you going to do now? Are you going to call the cops? No, I'm not going to call the police. That's not why I'm here. I'm just thinking that I could help. I want to help. I don't need help from you or anyone else. Now you just keep your damn mouth shut about seeing me. You got it? Yeah. Yeah, Dani, I got it. We're closed. Didn't you see the sign? Please, I just have a question. Now is not a good time lady, okay? You did a tattoo on a young girl. She was black, early 20s. I do a lot of tattoos, so what? Okay. She was pretty, three tattoos on her neck. It looked like a new tattoo. You a cop? I'm not a cop. She's my sister. She's your sister, why do you need me to tell you her name? That girl with a tattoo, she took my daughter. And if I came over here looking for her, you can bet that the cops will too. I don't know what you want me to do. I just need a name. I remember doing the tattoo, but I don't remember the name. Do I look like a chummy guy to you or what? Hey. Lena Harper. I know her, went to high school with her. She was here? Shut up. That's all she knows. Bite me. Lena's a bitch, and if someone took my baby, I'd want someone to help. Besides do you really want the cops crawling around here? Look, guys, I promise I will not tell the cops. Do you have any idea where I can find her? She could be anywhere. She's on social media, like everyone else. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Miracle! What the hell? Oh God. I am so sorry. Get out of here. Where's my phone? Girl, ain't nobody thinking about your phone. What was that? Mama, I was going to call the police. Oh no, no. Just wait. Just wait. That's probably just Mr. Steve or one of them kids, honey girl. I don't want no damn kids. You're acting real white right now. Oh, okay. What are you doing? You go and you check the kitchen. Me? Get in that kitchen. Ah. You scream, I shoot. I will shoot every bullet in this goddamn gun, reload and shoot again. You got it? Okay. Okay. Just don't hurt my baby, please. Sit. So you can just take whatever you want. Nobody has to know you were here. I won't say anything. Where's Miracle? I wasn't lying. Miracle isn't here. She was never here. Oh, I know she was here because I dropped her off my damn self. Now, ladies, listen, I have nothing to lose. How about you tell me about Lena? I don't know Lena. Mama? We don't know Lena. Why would I want any problems with you? Listen, I'm barely staying afloat here. I don't have my license or anything. The last thing I want is some attention around here. All I want is my little girl back. Now if one of you could please just tell me something, please. Okay, okay. You know something? Mama. I'm sorry, Mama. I know Lena. I was just too scared to say anything, but this is too much. Ms. Mae, what is she talking about? I don't know what she's talking about and she don't know what she's talking about. She smokes weed, okay. No, Mama... I'm not high. I'm not. - Are you sure? - I know Lena. Mama, I love you but we need help with these badass kids. I'm tired. This little girl don't know nothing about raising no children, but she's tired. Would you just shut up right now and let her talk? I hadn't seen her in over a year and there she was out of the blue. And we were in the back talking, just catching up and we heard the front bell and I got a call. And so, she offered to take care of it and that's it. I swear, that's it. So she's the one that took Miracle? No, that's not what happened. Lena didn't take Miracle. Somebody you know did. Are you lying to me? No, I wouldn't lie to you, I promise. Plus you're scaring the shit out of me right now. Oh my God. Was it a man? No. Some lady, she works with you. That's what she said. She came in wearing the same uniform as you and that's why I thought it was okay, and that's why I asked Lena to bring Miracle to her when I was changing diapers. She works with me. Why the hell didn't you just say that in the first place? I was scared. Oh my God. It can't be. You called and said it would be okay. Why would I say something like that? I would never say something like that. Oh my God. You have no idea what you have done. Carmen, I know you're in here. Carmen, where are you? Hey, girl. What's up? Oh, God. Hey. You came back. Hey, listen, that black Tahoe this morning, was it him? Huh? Are you sleeping with my husband? You married? Answer me. What? Okay, follow me. Follow me. Does it look like I'm sleeping with your husband, or any man for that matter? Where is she? How the hell, Dani? This is crazy. What are you doing? I don't have time for this. I need answers. Okay, and I don't have a clue what you're talking about. Miracle is missing. What? Girl, don't you play stupid with me because I know you had something to do with it. - Me? - Yes, you. So what? Eli, just so happens to show up at the diner around the same time I borrow the keys? What's up with that, Carmen? Okay, now this is about Eli? I am so confused. I saw you. I saw you on social media. I saw you. Okay. You saw what? You know Lena. You saw what? Who? I don't know who that is. I don't know how you let him get to you or why, but I want my baby. Dani, you sound batshit crazy. Mm-mm. You're never going to get away with this. Come on, man. Nothing but good to you! Carmen, no. What are you talking? Look, I trusted you, Carmen. I trusted you. You're really going to do this? Yes. You know what? Somebody get her out of here. No, no. Get out! Carmen, you can't do this to me! Yeah, tell this stuff to the police! I'm going to figure out what the hell you're doing! Get out! You are not my friend! You're going to come down here accusing me? This is how you treat your friends? This is not over! This ain't over, bitch! How dare you come in my house accusing me! You're never going to get away with this! You're never going to get away with this. Oh my God. Ma'am? Ma'am, is there anything I can help you with? Heard you had quite the night last night, Ms. Sidner. God, you've got to get me out of here. That's not how jail works. We put you in, not get you out. Where's Miracle? Okay. How about another question? Why did you take that gun from the diner? I know you took it because an officer interviewed your co-worker, Eli. Of course, they did. He tried to help you out. God, I took the gun because I needed protection. Jesus, Dani, Raina, whatever the hell your name is, are you out of your goddamn mind? Maybe I am. This thing you are doing is going to get your daughter killed. Don't say that. The clock is ticking on Miracle, Dani. Now let me help you. So you can give her over to Maurice? I already told you, he will never let me see her again. He's already got cops following me. Now how do I know that you're not in his pocket too? I am not dirty, but this whole thing stinks. Now either you give me something or you can sit your ass in jail. You don't know him like I do. Then tell me what you know. And you can skip that little girl fight at the party last night, because I already know about that. Oh, then you already know she's involved. Your friend's involved? Start with the Tahoe, and then my so-called friend Carmen. And then that slut, Lena Harper. Hey, Mom, can you stay with Braden tonight? Yeah. It's going to be a long day. Yeah. All right, and don't feed him any junk. Okay? Yes, I know you're proud of me. Okay. I got to go. I think I'm in trouble. I love you too. Captain. You don't actually believe that that woman is breaking into businesses? We found her after she forced herself into a daycare, reportedly with a weapon that she stole from, you guessed it, a local business. Yes. Okay. You've got me on that one, but I don't think she did this, Captain. Look, she avoided crossing state lines with her baby because she didn't want to break the law. Now does that sound like a criminal to you? It doesn't make sense, Captain. Neither do you. And before you start, don't give me that police hunch bullshit. We're detectives. We follow the evidence. Her child is missing. What kind of woman doesn't report her child missing? A desperate one. Look, I will keep a tail on her. She is not going anywhere. Okay. I'm going to let you have this one, but this woman has us looking like amateurs. Well, I'm open to suggestions. Call Child Services. They deal with neglect shit like this all the time. If the kid's in danger, they'll call. I think we should go a different route. When you become captain, you can go any route you want, until then call! I'm with you. You know why. But you have to help me out here, make this investigation official. Okay. I'll meet you halfway on this, but I still think I can reach her. Okay. But I still don't trust her. She's still there. No movement since I dropped her back off. All right. Well, someone from Social Services should be there soon. If anyone else comes to that room, call. If she moves- I know, call. This isn't my first rodeo. There's one way in, one way out. I've been watching it like a hawk. A hawk, huh? Okay. Keep me in the loop. Will do boss. I know how to do my job. I'll give you the jacket. Can I ask why you're running away? Gayle, it's best you didn't know. Thank you so much for doing this. Are you kidding me? This is the most fun I've had in years. Well, did you do it? Excuse me? The thing you're running away from. Did you do it? No, I didn't. Whoa. Okay. I didn't see a thing. Okay. This here. This here. Oh God, Gayle, you are a lifesaver. Ever since I moved here, you have been the sweetest, most-genuine person I have ever met. You cry. I cry. Don't do that. Just you go. Go be a badass. Woo, badass, huh? All right. Thank you. Excuse me, lady. Can I help you with something? I'm from Child Protective Services. I was called out here for a case, but it appears that no one's here. Someone's in there. I don't think there's anyone in there. I can see that, lady. We've got a problem. I'm sorry, I don't know how she got away. Well, don't worry about it, Hawkeye. I'll take it from here. Thank you. Okay. Let's make this official. All right, listen up. At 11:14 hours, we received a phone call from the Department of Children Services concerning a 10-month-old Black female baby, Miracle. Now, Child Services was unable to locate the mother, a Mrs. Raina Sidner. She is early 30s, black hair, brown eyes and at the time of disappearance Mrs. Sidner eluded surveillance. Look, this mother is scared and she is desperate, so I'm going to need us at our best. Baby Miracle is our top priority and I don't give a shit how long it takes. Either I handcuff you or you come in with me. Oh my God, fine. Let's go. What's your badge number? Let me ask the damn questions. I'm not here to give you any trouble. But you are giving me nothing but a hard time. This is my home. All right. Let's get to work. Price, keep me in the loop. We met before, right? I've never been arrested. Maybe at the diner? Corned beef hash is to die for. Maybe. But I'm sure that I've never met you. You two are pretty close friends, right? I thought so. Yes. Look, I didn't do this. Okay. But it's pretty odd, isn't it? I mean, your name's all over this case. How do you know Lena? I told you, for the 100th time, I don't know her. Tell me for the 101st time. Sweetie, for one, let me tell you something. I don't know half the people on my social media. Two, that woman has got to be some kind of lurker or something. And three, I didn't call anyone pretending to be Dani. I was organizing a party that I threw. In fact, check my call log, or whatever it is that you guys do. Oh, you're a waitress and party planner, huh? I do makeup tutorials online. You should watch. This is bullshit. I didn't even know that she had a husband, so we didn't have an affair or devise some kind of a plot to steal her kid. I like women. Lots of women. I'm talking short women, tall women, even women cops. I really get off on the ones that I only need to see once. As far as your little conspiracy theory about this uniform, honey, every woman in town that is a size four and has big boobs has worked at Jimmy's Diner. So the uniform, it could have come from anywhere. One second, sweetie. I got you, sweetie. Okay. I'm going to be right here. Her story checks out. No calls between Carmen and Lena. No calls to the daycare. Lena follows Carmen on the internet for makeup tutorials. Makeup tutorials. Shit. Okay. I don't believe her. How's my makeup? Be right back. You said you like all kinds of women. Yep. How about engaged women? Where'd you get this? I need to see you. Where did you get this? Now. She's just a woman that I met at a club. We were together for one night. What does she have to do with this? Can you all hear me? What have you got? Hello? Did you hear me? This. This could get ugly, Cap. Yeah, it can. Miracle? Maurice. Give me my babe! Oh, hey. You bastard. Take one more step and I'll bash your goddamn head in. You know me, Raina. Don't act like you don't. Answer that. Raina, I need you to listen to me. No, you listen to me. He has her. Did you hear me? You said that you were going to help me find my baby and he already has her. We know. I need you to listen to me right now, Raina. Where are you? You're there. You're at the house. All right, Raina, I need you to think about what you're about to do right now. Walk away. Walk away for Miracle. He is not worth it. You live to fight another day. I can't. I'm watching a woman that I don't even know holding my baby. I won't let him get away with this. He is an asshole, noted. But he hasn't broken any laws. Bullshit! He wants this fight. Look, he was granted a temporary restraining order against you, Raina. I don't care anymore. He's already called in the local authorities. You are doing exactly what he wants you to do. If you go to jail, you will never see Miracle again. Don't let him win this. I already told you, he always wins. This isn't over. Raina. My overtime, sign it. Who is it? Detective Price. Can I come in? Going somewhere? Apartment's paid up for a month, in case you want it. Oh, and just in case I am still a suspect, I'm going to square things up with Jimmy. Water under the bridge. Oh, great. Another question, so did you have anything to do with this? Yes. Wow. Perfect, Holly. Well, you know that having a social worker in the mix is just going to, I don't know, complicate things even more. Raina. All that shit you told me were lies. All that crap you said about helping me find my baby. "Oh, people in this town, oh, they care." Bullshit. I was just doing my job, and if you had... Look, this is an incident report. Now you said that he threatened you at the station, that's harassment. So maybe if we get something on file, then we can get a restraining order. An incident report? That's what you want to do? That was your big idea? Holly, come on, honey. Look, I know that you had the best of intentions, but there is nothing more that you can do to help me. Can I? Fine. You know that picture on my desk? That's my nephew, Braden. He's my sister's son, but I'm the one raising him now. You asked me if I would do anything to protect him. Well, I didn't because I didn't protect his mom. I was in the FBI back home in Georgia, but I knew it was going to happen. I could feel it. She had this boyfriend and he was so possessive. I warned her countless times, but she didn't listen. I guess he made her feel special. And then the one night she called me for help, I didn't come. I just figured, "What's the point? She's going to go back to him anyway." That's the night he killed her. Your husband, he's coming back. They always do. You said it yourself, he wants to end you. Look, I'm sorry I can't do more, but we have got to start somewhere. So I need you to sign this report. And go easy on your friend, okay? Because she had nothing to do with this. Do you see this house? This was the one that I was going to buy for me and Miracle, but I thought I was so smart. I knew that I needed to work awhile so I'd have proof to the bank that I had actually paid for it myself, just in case Maurice ever found us. I'm not proud of everything that I did, but as soon as my mom died I was on my own and had to do whatever it took to survive. And then here came Maurice. Oh my God, he was like my real-life Prince Charming. This guy had everything that I didn't, sophistication, class, money, style. I went from nothing to something overnight. But I know that it sounds crazy but, even with the mental and, yes, the physical abuse, he was so hard to leave. And it's just like your sister, he made me feel special. Maybe I was too naive or stupid to realize it in the first place. You are strong and you are smart. And I think you have a good dream. You stay safe, Raina. Hey. Hey. I know it's not much, but I wrote you a letter. It's not necessary. It is. It was him. He was the one that took her and I just didn't know who to trust or what to do, who to believe, and I thought that maybe you would... Oh God, Carmen, I am so sorry. You're the only friend that I really had and I just really hate- Okay, enough. I got you. Your landlord is very friendly. I'm starting to understand why you stayed in this hellhole. Where's my daughter? You know I'm not doing this like that. I trained you better than that. Relax. Okay, I'll make this easy. Just listen and sit. Sit. Where is she? It's simple, sign and I'll give our daughter back. I won't ask again. My daughter. And what the hell is this? Divorce papers. You get nothing. Sign an NDA and you disappear. You're good at that. Fine. And I want my money back. You know I don't have all of it. That's the deal. Take it or leave it. Perfect. Do you have a pen? I've got one over on the table. You try to stab me and I'll kill you. You almost got away with it. Almost. The under-the-table day job, mom and pop daycare. And I'm assuming you paid cash for Miracle's birth. No trace, no trace at all. It's like you just vanished into thin air with my money. I told you, I'm sorry about the money. It's not about the money. It's about teaching little disrespectful bitches like you a lesson. You had it all figured out. This, hospitals don't take tips. You overpaid by $14.50. When they couldn't find you, they sent the refund to your last billing address. Could you imagine learning you have a child like this, huh? Could you? Come here. I've been looking for you for a long time. I can't even imagine how much of my money you burned through over the year. I knew you weren't leaving the area right away after Miracle was born. The only skill you ever had was flipping burgers so I did a little digging and I found that dump of a diner where you work on social media and boom, there you were. Imagine my surprise. After that, it was a chess game. I just had to maneuver the right pieces. That's why you had your little bitch steal my baby. Don't you- - She's my baby. You hid my child from me. And I'd do it again because I was trying to protect her from you. Okay. When this is over, you will be broke, in jail, and childless. I have a real family now. Unlike you, Gigi is the perfect wife and mother. That is so perfect for you two. You little narcissistic asshole, your little baby-stealing girlfriend. Yeah. Oh God, you two will be perfect together. We got so much mouth. We got so much mouth. Come here, come here. Look at me! I'm her father. You will never ever see Miracle again. And I'm her mother. What took you so long? She said she would only talk to you. Sorry, I was at the station. What do we got? Just shot him in cold blood and doesn't deny it. She used a gun from the diner. My guess is she's been playing us all along. With all due respect, Captain, you're wrong. It's a good thing you hired me. Let her go. Are you out of your mind? It was self-defense. I told you, he's crazy. I told you so isn't a defense. A restraining order is. It's been filed. On Saturday. I put in my overtime, Captain. The incident report and restraining order? Judge signed the restraining order. Maurice Sidner was not allowed within 500 feet of her. He clearly violated it. It's all on your desk. No staples. I know how you hate them. That's why I was late. It's all over. What about Miracle? You're going to have to answer a few questions, but she's coming home. Oh, thank God. And if you have any problems, you're covered, thanks to Eli. Eli. Yeah. He said he saw Maurice sitting outside your place and watching you leave the diner. You really do have friends in this town. I guess I do. Thanks, Holly. Say hi, Uncle Jimmy. I did not think I would see you anytime soon. Well, we can't leave without saying goodbye and thank you. Oh, save it. Just take care of this pretty little girl is all the thanks I need. About that little incident in your office. I just wanted to say- Uh-uh. All's well, ends well. As long as you're safe. Hey. Hi. I thought you was coming later. Bye. Figured I'd get a head start. Okay. So this is it? Yeah. Okay. So maybe when you get a little settled in, you'll finally let me take you out on a date. Maybe coffee? You know I don't have the best reputation when it comes to coffee. No, you don't. Not at all. So maybe we can try a little lunch. Yeah? Okay. Thank you, Eli. No problem. Break it up. Break it up. Break it up. Break it up. Yeah, Carmen, go ahead. Yes, indeed. I see you finally let her meet her step daddy. Okay. Carmen, why are you so messy? Oh my gosh, you look incredible. Well, thank you, darling. You really do. So are you for real, for real rich? I guess that means you have to visit to find out. 1425 Somerset. That is exactly where you'll find us. But no, for real, I did tell you about Eli, but you don't listen. You have terrible taste in men. And you have terrible taste in women. Okay, touché. Whatever. Oh, wait, listen, let's get a picture because you guys look too cute not too. Okay. Listen, Carmen, I just wanted to thank you for being a real friend. I couldn't have done this without you. Give me my own room. Look over here. Of course. Everybody ready? 1, 2, 3, cheese. So what's the plan? To give my beautiful baby girl the best life that I can. What about you, Miss Holly? Well, thanks to you, I got some overtime money, so I took a few days off. I'm doing some other things. I know how much you sacrificed to get us here, Holly. Thank you for believing in me. I was just doing my job. Oh, hey, did you get it? What are you talking about? And you even gave us candy. Hi, momma. Now that's some real love right there. Enjoy your family. You too.
