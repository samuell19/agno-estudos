Hello? Rach? Rachel. Fuck. Hi, Jack. Hope work was all right today. I've decided to set off early to Mum so Ben can sleep in the car. But I'll catch you later. Lots of love. Bye. Hello? Hi, Jack. It's Holly. Look, I don't want to worry you, but Rach and the little man haven't arrived yet. They were meant to be here about three hours ago. I've tried calling, but there's no answer. Look, it's probably nothing, and everything's fine. But, give me a call when you get this message so I can put my mind to rest. No. Where's my family? I... I can get... the money for you. OK? You just need to give me more time. Just give me another day, and I can get it. I can get all of it. I can get you more! Just give me one more chance. You don't need to hurt my wife and son.

Get home safe, and see you next time. Mom! Not, the best I've had. It's incredible. You're never in college anyway so today won't make a difference. While I was coming past, we are both in second period so I thought I'd come say hi. So impressed, Mom. Yeah, that is like serious money. Kind of you to say so, Heidi. Glad you both weren't too bored. Like I said, they've done better before. I give you both a lift to college on my way home? But you need to make your own way back. OK? - I'll go and get the car. - Thanks, Mrs. Templeton. - Saves you bus money. - Hmm. - Cold? - Oh! - Isn't it? - What? The weather. It's cold. Sorry, yeah. I'm new around here. I don't think I've seen you before. Do you live close? It's getting dark. I can walk you home if you like. Hmm... I'm not dodgy. Don't worry. Thanks for the offer, but this is actually my bus, and it stops right outside my house. Don't worry, I'm sure I'll see you around. Sure. I'll be seeing you. I'm Josh, by the way. Sam. Mmm. Oh. Mmm. That's new. Dad? Mom? Mom? See you later, then? Dad? Where are you? Dad? Dad, are you out here? Still, they still haven't cleared it? There's only so much of this the company can take. Yes, we've all got deadlines to meet and they are no exception. No one's exempt from karma, not me, not you, not them. And you just tell them that if they don't sort it out then we're gonna have to take this further. This isn't a joke. This is business. I'm being fair, aren't I? Just tell me I'm being fair. No. Just-- Hold on. Sam. Everything OK, babe? Yeah. Is now a good time? If you're working, it can wait. Now don't be silly, kiddo. I've always got time for you, ain't I? One sec. OK. You got that? You just make sure they understand who they're dealing with here! I in front of you. Just some people not playing ball, you know? But I have just found out I've got to go to the office this weekend now. As in... the office, office? Yeah, I'll be back Sunday night at the latest. Because your Mum's got some work to be doing. Look, you know how it is. Someone messes the company around I'll have to go in and show me face. Give them a bollocking. I'll do us a nice roast on Sunday, though. You better. Where's your kiddo necklace? You ain't lost it again? No, don't worry. It's inside. Now that's a relief. Breakfast? Mmm. I'll see what I can rustle up. You got a late start today, then? Yeah. I've got to go in, register collect a letter, and then leave. Are they deliberately wasting your time? Seems like it. Tomato, right? Thanks, Dad. Making arrangements for the weekend already? That's my girl. Just thinking about having the girls over. Well, you make sure Heidi don't smoke indoors again. - One day she'll learn. - Will do. Two shakes. Look, Andrew. I'm with my daughter. Can't this wait? I think it's a bit late to be breaking their legs, don't you? Look, if they don't deliver we cut our loses and terminate the clients. Now, only call me if it's an emergency. Thank you. Sorry about that, kiddo. Just as bad as you, hey? So what's Mom doing at the office? She's meeting that guy that bought her painting. I still can't believe that it went for seventy grand! Your mum's good at what she does. I'll take it you want a lift to college, then? Yeah, if that's all right. I'll get the bus back. Not a problem, kiddo. He was fine with it, yeah. Well, Simon's been called to work this weekend so I won't be here, either but we have an arrangement to pick it up when we get back. Yeah, yeah. A transfer, yeah. No. No, that's OK. Fifteen percent this time, right? No, not a problem. I just like to get these things sorted beforehand. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, look, Harry, I've got to dash. Yeah. No, sorry it's been brief but I'll touch base with you on Monday, yeah? OK. Bye. Bye, now. Bye. Sorry, Sam. Just need to get it all sorted before we go. So you're definitely going with Dad, then? Only till Sunday, though. Got to get back and get the painting to the buyer. You won't even notice we've gone. If Heidi can vouch for Toby's friends I don't see what the problem is. A bit of alcohol never hurt anyone. Who cares if Ella doesn't drink? No offense, babe. - It's cool. - I mean... home alone for the weekend, it's to be expected. Babe, you're really gonna have to go outside for that one. They're gonna smell it upstairs. Yeah, it's a good thing Alex isn't here. It's the third one this hour, she'd flip. Man, you guys are like having two moms. Oh, how much did your mom's painting go for yesterday? Like seventy thousand. Wow, that's amazing. The Templetons. Even your name sounds rich. Why can I never get any signal? We're in the middle of nowhere. None of us gets signal. Shit. I got some in the bathroom a few days ago. You get a bar or two by the window. Anyway, that is the plan. Toby's bringing around these guys that he hangs around with. They are the hot ones. Yeah, but, babe, if Ella's not gonna drink... Honey, just pretend to be drunk. They're boys, they don't know the difference. I guess. It just seems a bit weird that none of us know his friends. We've been together, almost a year. His friends are safe, and plus, they're hot. So, what do you care, really? Sam, you said Bus Stop Boy was Irish, right? That's Josh. He's got this whole mysterious stranger vibe going on. Inviting mysterious boys around. Really? Well, Sam knows him. Met him, once. At a bus stop. And I know Toby, obviously. Trust me, it will all be fine. What do you say, Sam? Sam? Sam! Kiddo, what's up? Come on, Sam. We've got a plane to catch. What? You said you wanted to talk to me quickly. Oh, right. Yeah. I wanted to ask you if I could have the girls round. Just the girls? Heidi, Alex, Ella... Yeah. Of course you can. You can do what you like as long as it's safe and legal. Just don't let them anywhere near the studio, OK? The painting's still in there. And my rules, too. Nothing-- Nothing gets stolen, I stay safe and the house doesn't burn down. I got it. And if anything happens, you make sure you call me straight away, and I'll get it sorted. See you Sunday. Love you, kiddo. Well, I'm glad I didn't pay to see that at the cinema. Why? I thought it was quite good. I want to know what happens next. Stupid ending. You're still on your diet? Look, I go out and run and you do whatever it is you do. Wait another minute. There's always a scene after the credits. Shh, Alex. - Did you hear that? - Hear what? I think it was there. Wait! No, no, no. I wanna see what happens next. Thank you. His friends won't disappoint, I promise. It's not quite his friends I'm worried about, Heids. - Hello, babe. - Hey. Hello, stranger. Hello, yourself. See, I told you it was Josh. Small world, hey? Hmm. Oh, Sam. Shit. Sorry. This is Matt. Hey. Matt's clearly the talkative one. Guilty. Guilty as charged. Sorry. Guys, come in. You must be freezing. Thought you'd never ask. So how do your parents afford this palace? Her mom's a famous painter, that's how. I didn't know decorating was something you can be famous for. It tends to be more, easel-based. She's being modest. One of her mom's paintings went for seventy grand the other day. No shit. What about you, Sam? Any good at it? Depends on what you mean by "it." By that, she means "no." I'm definitely not an artist. She does have other talents, though. I think that's what Heidi was getting at, hey? I'm just gonna go to the bathroom a bit. Sorry. - Uhh, has anybody seen the time? - What about it? Uhh, I think it's time we had a drink. Don't you? Ah. Shots, shots, shots, shot-- Oh, there it is. Shots. Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to sit this one out, guys. I'm not feeling too good. I'm like, have a lay down. I think I smell a pussy. Oh, shut your legs, laddie. That is disgusting. Why are you my boyfriend? Now, Matthew. No more secret ingredients. What have I told you? It's morally wrong. Fuck you. Oh, shit. Gonna make a phone call. I'll be two seconds. Gonna have my shot for me. I'll try. You won't get any signal here. It's a literal blind spot. I'm full bars. Must be a good network. Or I just have a terrible phone. Tell your mum I said hello. Have you got everything? Good. How long are you gonna be? Last house on the left. You can't miss it. Hey. Did you get that? Repeat it back to me. Come on, then, Ella. Let's get you a drink. Uh-uh. Don't be such a bore, Ella. One shot is not gonna kill you. So, you've been offered some of my booze - for free... - You're gonna say no? Be fucking rude. - OK, maybe I'll have one. - That's the spirit. Oh. Sam, do you know the light in your bathroom isn't working? It keeps flickering. I know. The window's broken too. Dad's gonna fix it when he's back. Oh no, not a broken light in the Templeton household. What's going on? There's a broken light in the house. Would it be too cheeky to ask to invite a couple mates round? They're safe. Don't worry. Yeah, it would be cheeky... But whatever. Uhh, more drinks over here, please, tots. Whoah. Easy, tiger. Alex is passed out in the next room. Why don't we show them round some? - Show off the manor. - It's hardly a manor. Here, come on. Let's have a look. Fine. But don't touch anything. If it looks expensive it probably is. Her mom will have a fit. Wake up Alex, will you? Oi, Sam, is everything you've got up there your mom's? I think so. She's done so much, I really can't keep track. Your smoke is probably gonna damage not to mention-- - Our lungs. - Chill out. A tiny bit of second-hand smoke is not going to kill you. Problem solved. I'll stand here and smoke instead. Yeah, and now it's freezing. And that banging is annoying as fuck. For fuck's sake. Sorted. Only 'cause it's your house and your rules. Hey, Sam! Any chance we could see where the magic happens? My mom's art studio? I'm not really allowed to let anyone in there. Oh, go on. Show us how she makes all the money. Fine. But leave your cups here. And don't touch anything. Where are you going? I, uhh... Sorry. I just guessed. I've got no idea where I'm going. - Must be the booze. - Uhh, Sam? What's in these two, funny doors? Well, one's a shoe cupboard and so's the other one, I think. They're not very big but there's a connecting door between, which is kinda cool. They're not that big. It's fucking massive. Right. I'll take that. Now. Seriously, guys. Don't touch anything. - I'm dead if you do. - Got it. This is it. Just think about all the money that's been made in this room. Ridiculous. Is any of her stuff even here? I don't think so. What's this, then? Josh! That's my mom's painting that she sold at the auction! I told you, don't touch it. What if I just touch it? - What are you gonna do? - Josh! I wouldn't dare. Oh. What's going on here, then? Busted... What's with all the plastic? I feel like anything I touch in here might break. Sam, your mom's paintings are shit. But do you know how much they go for? Sam? Do you reckon your parents have every fucked in it? OK. Let's go. So, a hot tub and a pool. Well, that's when you know you've made it. Hey, Sam! What's in those two garages? My dad's car collection. He's got a Jaguar, and an Aston-- I would kill, literally kill, to drive one of those. And the quad-bikes. I'd rather not get killed by your reckless drunk driving. OK, guys. Ready, after three? One, two, three. No, that is definitely enough now. I am properly peaking and my 8 a.m. run is looking more like an 8 p.m. run. Yeah, I'm definitely ready for bed. Not sleeping. At. Good shout. I'm feeling pretty tired too. Guys, we'll have the-- No attempt to be subtle. Oh, and they say romance is dead. So how do you guys know each other? Through college, or? Oh yeah, Oh yeah, went there a couple of years ago. Didn't do too well, though, mind. Well, speak for yourself. I absolutely smashed it. So you're the odd one out, then? Well, what can I say? What do you take? She takes it hard and she fucking loves it. Yeah, I take Sports Science, actually. In case you couldn't already tell. Oh yeah? Uhh, my mate Mike does that. Oh, Mike. Yeah. Are we still talking about Sport Science? Yeah, but it's a part of it. Oh, get involved. All right, I'm not that good. You know what these sport scientists are, dear? Look at this little player trying his luck. - Any jealous types? - I'm more of a dunce, really. So, how did you guys meet? Well... I met these two, through a friend when I had to leave in my hometown, in Ireland. We were into the same sort of stuff, so we got a flat, just outside of town. Oh, that's sweet. Yeah, it's a pretty nice place considering you're only 24. How do you afford that? Oh, I... my nan left it to me. That's a cute necklace, Sam. What does it say? My dad got it for me. "Kiddo." That is cute. Where is your dad? What does he do? Oh, he's into the whole global stock trade financial crap. He doesn't really like to get me involved. He is a firm believer, people get what's coming to them. Hence why he's in New York raining hell down on some poor guy right now. Sounds scary. Don't worry. Mom is much scarier. Cheers for inviting us round, Sam. It's actually been a really good night. And I can tell it's only gonna get better. Fucking right. It's fine. I'm glad we got to know each other better. Are your other friends still coming round? I think Ella's getting a bit lonely-- No! Really, I'm fine. We completely forgot. I'll be two seconds. I meant to say to you about that, Sam. I... don't think it's a good idea for Josh to invite anyone else. - Why not? - Ella. Chill out. Stop going on about it. They'll be here in a second. It'll be fine. And we stay up here until we finish and then they'll go. Yeah. Sam, it's cool. We all live together with a bunch of us. They're only gonna be a few hours and they know it. Exactly. Come on, Ella. Have a drink. It's not gonna kill you. I'm not really up to getting hammered. Sorry to disappoint. I'll be right back. Could you see where Josh is, Ella? Josh? Josh. Keep walking, the alarm's been cleared. Yes. Go right at that one. All right, boys. This is much appreciated. We owe you, man. Just set us up You know what you're here for, right? Bottom floor, you can't miss. Start with the keypad. Look at the code. The four girls upstairs Matt and Toby wouldn't know. It is just over here, boys. You were right, Josh. This place is a goldmine. You think that's impressive? Just see what we're here for. So we're just gonna take it without bothering them? In, and out. It's easy. Follow me. Is that you, Ella? You been there long? Guys! Guys? Come on, Ella. We only want to talk. Shit! Listen, Josh. I am calling the police right now so just leave me alone! If you go right now, I didn't see a thing and we can forget about it and move on. Please. Please don't hurt me. Not again. Listen. This doesn't have to go too far if you let us do what we're here to do. You've ruined everything. Boys, listen. Where's Mike? Hey, boss. There's a slight change of plan. You boys get out of here. We'll handle this. What's in there? Just some tools. Torches. - Stuff we might need. - OK. Here. Now. Yes, if I see her, I will. I'll be, I'll be back in a sec. What the fuck? What's happening? She saw us. Who? Ella. Shit. What about the plan? The plan's changed. Changed? To what? Listen. It will be easier, the less of us there are. You guys, get out of here. Mike, we'll call you when we're done. Well, where is she? Fuck, Josh. Jesus! She's still breathing. What do we do? She's not drunk, mate. She won't forget this. Do we stick to the plan? Toby, man... You know I wouldn't suggest this unless it was the last resort, but... I really can't see other way. Don't say what I think you're getting at. We're gonna have to kill her. - What? - We... We, we kill her. We hide the body. By the time anyone finds it we'll be long gone with what we came for. You said this wouldn't happen, mate. Not again. We had one task. One simple fucking task. We can't just kill her. She's got family, mate. Think about it. We thought about it. You think I want to do this? - We don't have a choice! - This isn't a game, Josh. She doesn't get a second chance. Well, neither do we. There are other ways to solve this. She wakes up, rats us out to the police our entire plan is fucked! At least this way, we'd still pay our debt. I can't let you do this. Jesus Christ, Toby! Just weigh up your fucking options here. I'm not killing anyone. Help Matt wrap stuff up in there. I won't be long. Whoah, steady on, babe. Everything all right? Yeah, yeah. I just, had to come up here, felt really ill. So you decided to combat that by drinking even more? Good plan. Where's Josh? Is he still with Ella? Come on, Sam. Queen of frigidity. As if. I heard... she's just wandered off. Probably trying to get signal. Is he still looking for her? You guys continue. I'll go help. Wait! Umm... She'll be back in a sec. Don't, don't worry about it. Here. Have another drink. I'm good for now. But cheers. Everything OK? Ella? Josh? You out there? Guys? You know, Ella? You've only got yourself to blame, really. It was like two o'clock in the morning. I was really smashed, and... Did you guys hear that? Hear what? Sounded like somebody's getting freaky in the Templeton household. I take it she found him, then. Anyone? Oh, come on. My house isn't that big. Ella? Josh! Yeah! Going down! Josh. Oh! Sam? Sam. - Sam! - Mmm. What's happening? I don't know. I've just woken up and seen you and Alex. Alex? - Alex, wake up! - Oh, my head. Oh, how much did we drink? Oh, what happened? Yeah, I ache like a bitch. Where is everyone? Downstairs? It's fucking freezing. Sorted. They've all just... gone. Hang on. The lights. - Fuck. - Hey. Just use this. I just don't understand it, though. Even if they did drug us why come to a party, leave halfway through and not even take anything? Exactly, and I know Toby wouldn't try anything. Obviously. Oh no. They wouldn't dare. I wouldn't dare. Sam, what is it? Oh no. This isn't happening. What is it? Oh shit. All my mom's paintings gone. No, you can't blame yourself. They obviously knew what they were looking for. I can't blame myself? I let them into my house. I showed them where it was. I even left the bloody door open! Blame me. He's meant to be my boyfriend. I'm gonna call him now. Shit. My brilliant phone. You got Sam in so much trouble. Look, can we just come back to all this later? And focus on the slightly bigger problem of where the fuck is Ella? Why don't you just report her missing if you're so fucking worried about her? I'm just saying, where is she? Ella? Maybe she's just passed out upstairs or something? If Ella isn't in here, I don't know where she's gonna be. We have looked everywhere. Why would she be in here? Thought she'd had enough mid-party. She'll be downstairs. It's OK. Heidi, it's all right. It's all right. Breathe, OK? Everything's gonna be fine. Just calm down. Just breathe. Let it out. In breathe. Slowly. It's gonna be fine. You're gonna be all right. Hey, it's gonna be fine. I promise. Hey, everything's gonna be OK. I'm gonna open the cupboard. They're gonna jump out at us. It's gonna be hilarious. Just, keep calm. The most important thing to do is keep calm. Ella! Oh my god, Ella! Wake up, please. Wake up. Wake up, please. - Hey. - OK, roll her. - Hey. - It's gonna be fine. Ella. Ella, come on. Ella. Ella, come on. Ella, come on. Wake up! Wake up. Wake up, please. Ella, come on. Oh! Oh! Heidi, no! They might be out there! Please. Her... her face... Call the police, Alex. Why can I never get any signal? We're in the middle of fucking nowhere! None of us get any signal! - Oh shit. - Just use the house phone. You did cut the phone lines, didn't you? - Yeah. - Good. We're in enough shit as it is now, thanks to you. - Is there a problem? - She didn't have to die. You could have just injected her and got on with it. I mean, look at us now. We're fucked. - Wait. - What? They could still get help. There's a police station. Twenty minutes down that way. Ten, if they run. We've got to go back and finish the job. - No way. - Absolutely no way. You can't be serious. Did you not hear what I just said? You are serious, aren't you? Josh, I'm not hurting anyone. How can you so easily talk about murdering three innocent girls like that? Josh! As much as I hate your fucking guts right now you're right. We've got to do something, but I swear to god we ain't repeating The past, is the past. No. But we've got to do what we've got to do. Get in the car, circle around. If you see anything, call us. And be ready to drive. Jesus Christ. Yeah, it's me. No. Change of plan. It's all gone to shit. We need another pair of hands. No. Just you. Toby's lost his nerve. OK. Take the painting. Keep it safe in the front. - Was that Mike? - Yeah, he's on his way down now. I'll be in the car. Listen. It's us, or them. OK? We do, what we gotta do. Nothing else, all right? I don't want you getting carried away enjoying yourself. No one dies. Do you hear me? I mean it. Got it. So, to sum up. We've got no signal no internet, and no home phone. And I've got a sprained ankle. Could we be in any more trouble? We should get some knives from the kitchen and stick together. We're gonna be fine. And do what? Wait until daylight? This isn't a film, Sam. The bad things don't only happen at night time. I say we head for the police station. It's ten minutes away. Can you both keep up? Umm, hello? I'm not going anywhere. I can't. We should just sit tight and wait. Just stay here, Alex. We'll come up with something. Don't rush. There is no point in splitting up. We don't have time to come up with something. What if they're on their way back now to finish the job? I'd rather take my chances. - Seriously? - Shit. Just wait, Alex, for fuck's sake. Look, it'll be ten minutes to get into town. I'll bring the police back with me. Just, stick together and you'll be fine. Now what do we do? Like I said we arm ourselves we hide and we wait. Josh, you've got to listen to me, mate. We're not killers. - What's the plan, then? - We lock them upstairs I give them the injection then light it up. They could still get out of the window but it gives us enough time to get away before they call the police. These people are bigger than the police. If we got caught, prison's the least of our worries. How did you get in this mess in the first place? It's a long story, mate. I'll tell you when we're done. So you think there'll be some in there, yeah? My dad fixes up classic cars so it's got to be one or two. Besides, we got all this booze. What's that? Ain't gonna be them, is it, Josh? She's not gonna let them come downstairs. Let's just get on with the job and fuck off. Hey, Mike. You got that torch? Yeah. Gonna need that later. Oh, thank you. Fucking batteries. Mike, Matt. Let's do what we gotta do, and get out of here. Come on, come on. Please, please. Come on. Oh. Oh, thank god. Shit. Heids! Shit! Oh. I'm so sorry, Alex. Fuck! Check over there. Keep an eye out, will you, Mike? Mate. Have you seen this car? It's an original. It's even got a car phone. Imagine how much this is worth. Yeah, I'm sure it's nice. Any chance of you having a look so we can get out of here? Fuck's sake. I've got it. That's the one. Where is she? - That's got to be ten minutes. - Any minute now. So hoping she will be safe. Just keep quiet. I just don't understand why Toby's done this. I feel so guilty. For you. For Ella. Do you think our whole relationship was to get him here tonight? I doubt it, Heids. We've got no way of proving it. I just wanna know why they're so desperate for the money. I promise I wouldn't have suggested inviting them here if I'd known something like this was gonna happen. Toby was so perfect before he met Josh and Matt. And now all three have become strangers within a couple of hours. Alex! Heidi, wait! That could have been anything. I don't know if I could make it downstairs. My ankle's killing me. That's fine. Stay here, but keep your knife on you. I'm not staying here. Ella? OK. Come on to the balcony, but keep your knife on you. I don't want anything to happen to you, Heids. I'll keep a look out. See anything? There's no one. Alex? Alex? I think it was just the door swinging. Heidi? Heidi? Heidi? Oh my god! Josh? I'm sorry you got caught up in this, Sam, but... that's just the way it is. We need to get on with it. I don't want to hurt you. Come on, Sam! You know me. I promise. Doing what you think. Fuck! Where are you! What? Anyone home? Listen, Sam. Just want to lock you in a room. So we can burn the place down. No biggie. That way you can't prove anything and we can do what we've come here to do. No one has to die. No one else, has to die. How about a key? Fuck! How tall do you reckon you are, Sam? Five... Six? Five, seven? Man? I've got this. We're gonna go with... five-seven! - Go, Sam! - In the night! Fuck off! Leave me alone! You must be Sam! Fuck did you go? Right here, dickhead! I guess we're gonna have to explain how you accidentally strangled yourself. You bitch. Mike! What the fuck, Sam? We're not even trying to kill you! Everything all right, babe? Heidi? But... I'm right here. We're gonna figure this out. Him and me. If Ella hadn't fucked all this up I'd be very fucking rich right now and you'd be safe and sound asleep upstairs. Now look how much of my precious time you've wasted! Didn't see that one coming, did you? Kiddo. All we wanted to do was steal that fucking painting. Still... doesn't have to end badly. Heids. You're my best friend! I'm sorry, Sam. I really am. Toby offered me money to help the guys out. I didn't think one painting would break your mom's bank. You pathetic worthless piece of crap! I hope you rot! Ladies you can sort this out later when we have a a little bit more time. Sam! Would you kindly head upstairs so we can lock you in? As for you... Heidi you'll definitely get your cut when this is over. Where's Matt? Sam locked him in. Shall I go and get him? No. This is perfect. Shh, shh Just, just let it all out. Just cleaning up loose ends, hey, Sam? Sam? Sam! The fuck? Oh shit! For fuck's sake! You better start talking, mate. What's going on, Josh? And why is that bl--? That's fucking Heidi, isn't it? - What have you done? - You better step the fuck back! This wasn't me. I arrived a second ago. This... This is Sam. She must have found out that Heidi is working with us. This is too far. Toby's gonna break. You know what you've done here, Sam. We only wanted the paintings. Now three people are dead and you have killed two of them. We ain't got time for this! Better not being silent, little whore! Shit. No signal. She never gave me her number. Wait here. Keep your eyes open. Heidi's. She'll have it. Fucking house. You must have wanted that painting pretty fucking bad! You... have no idea Look, she is gonna die. Would you like to join us? - Enough is enough. - Oh, really? I guess today is your lucky day, Sam. You might want to stop struggling. You see... that painting's gonna clear our debt. You and your friends? You're just collateral. Well, what about Heids? What did you--? Heidi! Told us that her friend's mother was some famous artist. So, I got her to do a bit of research. It was simple, really. A simple plan that Ella really fucked! Just get on with it, Josh! We haven't got time for this. Just light up the fucking place. - You won't. - Oh... I will. Picture it. Flames, tear into these walls... your mother's art studio burning to the ground... your dad's cars going up in a fireball. You're sick! No. I'm losing a lot of blood. I'm feeling woozy here. I've been stabbed in the fucking shoulder. You know he's lying to you about Heidi? I would never kill someone like that. - You fucking what? - Yeah. Guilty. Guilty as charged. Best not let this get any messier than it needs to be. You and Toby can't even get the money to him. So... I guess you need me. Once this is done me and you are gonna have words. You see, Sam... this was never part of the plan. So I don't know that, this will kill you. Or just send you to sleep. Either way... it's going to hurt. We could have been good together, Sam you and I. You like me. Your dad really liked me, too. We could have fixed up cars together. My dad will fucking kill you! Sweet dreams. - Kiddo. - Don't use it all. We might need some later. Good point. Alex went... So at least she's... What? What did you say? Mate, we're out of time, we've got to fucking go. Just leave her here. Still can't believe what you've done back there. If you came here to - Are you listening to me? - What the fuck... Toby! What the hell, Toby? What happened here? Just listen. No. - Where's the cargo, Toby? - It's there. It's there. It's no time to be talking-- The fucking car! Josh! Listen, please! I was going the block like you told me to. - She came out of nowhere. - She? Alex. Good boy, Toby. Good boy. What happened to you? I got fucking stabbed, mate. Fuck. What, what happened? Where's Heidi? - She won't be joining us. - Why? We've got to get out of here. We'll talk on the way. But we don't have long. I think I need a hospital. I've lost a lot of blood, hey? We can't drive in that. The brakes are fucked, and you can't even see out the front. So we've got to walk, then, boys. Take that. We're going through the forest. What do you mean, Heidi's not joining us? Come on! Come on. Come on. Yeah. - Daddy? - Hello? Daddy! Hello? Oh god. Is that you? Please don't tell me something's happened. Sam! Sam! Sam! Come on. Even if we don't drop Matt off at the hospital we'll never make it to the drop-off point in time. I can't... We keep, moving. We will make it to the drop-off point in time. But Matt won't. Look at him. I've had enough of this. Just call the fucking guy-- I'm in charge here! And I say, we make it. Once this is done you better keep your distance you sick son of a bitch! What happened in that house? Heidi... He killed your girlfriend! - But... - It's all bullshit! He cut her fucking throat! This is again, isn't it? If you weren't such a fucking psycho we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place! He came begging. Fucking nutjob got chased out of his own town. Any guesses why? He'd be fucking crazy in another job! Started killing all these innocent people again! Sound familiar? - You killed Heid! - Leave it, Toby! You don't know what he's capable of. Let's just get the job done, and fuck off. You can't run from the guilt! There's no redemption. You've just got to make the most of it. Like me. Tonight all of those people... I loved every second of it. Josh. Listen to me. Josh, wait! You didn't have to kill anyone! Please. I might need you later. Toby? Toby! Oh my god. Sam! Sam, where are you? Sam. Shit. Sam! Sam! Come on, Sam! Sam! Wake up, Sam! We've got to go now! Toby! Stop! Leave it. Shit. What the fuck, Toby? I never killed anyone, Sam. It was all Josh. We needed your mom's paintings to save our lives not to hurt anyone. Then, and I saw Josh, and he did what - he does. - Where is he now? He's gone to meet our boss to deliver the painting. Just on the other side of the forest. They're not interested in us, Sam. I really am sorry. You know what? We need to get to a hospital or a police station. Now! Take your pick. The police. But Sam, it really wasn't me. It was all him. I know, Toby. You could drive, right? Oh. Thank fuck for that. Are you Templeton? No. Get inside and we'll talk. The boss is on the line for you. Mr. Templeton, sir. It's me. You have the money? One better. We got this, painting from this rich girl's house, up in the country. It's got to be worth, three times what we owe you. We left a bit of a mess there but, the extra money should cover that. The painting. Yeah, the... the rich girl's mom's some... world-famous artist. It's got to be worth a pretty penny. It's called Guilt. It's by... One second, sir. It's called Guilt, by... Martha Templeton. Mr. Templeton, I... Wait! Straight to the police station, yeah? You can do this, Toby. That's strange, I've... always wanted to drive one of these, but... under the circumstances, it doesn't seem so important. You're doing the right thing, Toby. You've redeemed yourself. Are you sure, boss? I mean, they're hardly professionals, are they? Every single one of them. I don't care who they are. Terminate them all. Guess you wanted to know why we needed the money so bad. I don't care anymore. It must have been bad, that's all I need to know. But what I don't understand is why Josh didn't drug Ella like he did the rest of us. We'd have found out the painting was gone either way. That's Josh for you. He's unpredictable. What the fuck is that? What? Where? Back there. On the ground. It looked like- - Alex. - Sam, listen. I can explain. Shit! Sam? Sam. Sam? Sam? Sam! Wake up, Sam! Sam! Even this one, boss? - She's got a-- - We've got our orders. Sam! You killed her! She had nothing to do with any of this. That wasn't us. That was you and your mates. You're gonna wanna see this. Shit. Torch it. Please! Please! No. Please. We can work something out. - It's done. - No, put it out! Minor complication, Mr. Templeton, sir. One of them was wearing a necklace. And tonight's last item. Guilt. The final work of Martha Templeton a truly beloved figure in the high-art world. This piece tragically foreshadowed her own fate, however as, after losing her 18-year old daughter Templeton blamed herself and could not live with that guilt. She took her own life leaving her husband behind. Our thoughts go with him as he now has no one left. As the painting depicts there is always a reaction to every action a law applicable to us all.
