You never know-- he might choke. Thanks a lot, zach. Yeah, well, you know, business is business. Hey. 20 bucks says your man bites it. Sure, dwight. Nice to see someone with some guts. Come on, kyle. You got it. Choke. Choke. Piece of cake, kyle. Piece of cake. Come on, you got it. ♪ Beat the machine... ♪ keep it going. Keep it going. Shoot. Come on, shoot. Player defeated. Game over. Yeah! Ha ha! It's supposed to be one guy-- one guy only. Whoops. Excuse me. Hey. What the hell was that? What was what? You just butted into my game like that. Your game? Last time i checked, it was open to the public. Not when you're going for the record, all right? That was my last chance to win. You royally screwed me up. The way you play, it's not too hard. Oh, you're hilarious. You think you got the contest in the bag now, right? What contest? What do you mean, what contest? Where've you been, mars? No. Ohio. I just moved here. That contest. That's news to me. But you don't have to worry because i'm not into dolls. Is it looking at me? It's scanning you. I think it wants to kill you. Whoa. Scared me. Come to see my baby? Our baby, russell. I've spent enough on this thing. Well, he's worth it. He exceeds all our expectations. That's fine, but all i want to know is will he be ready by tomorrow? After a few adjustments, he'll be perfect. It had better be. We've got lots invested in this thing. This contest of ours is a lot more than a marketing ploy. - It's a test. - I know. I'm serious. If there's as much as one screw-up, russell, you're history. Evolver's going to make history, jerry. I hope you're right. What, are you in yet? This is taking forever. These guys are smart. They don't mess around. It takes time. So what's all this mean? "10, 26, 14, 37"-- what's that all mean? It's nothing. It's just a smoke screen. - There. Perfect trojan horse. Right there. - Perfect what? Well, look, see this grouping? I wrote a fake entrance routine into cyber-tronix's system. When someone came along with their pass numbers, i copied them down. Whatever that means, you're a genius. It means we're in. My meat loaf's getting dried out. I'm going to clobber him. Those are the figures you approved. You know i could sell that house in a second. Hey, that's your problem. O.k. fine. Fax it to me. I got to go. All right. Bye-bye. The meat loaf smells great. Then why don't you stay? I can't. I got a date. I wish i could. Oh, yeah. Mr. Right. His name is mr. Ryke, and he's a very nice man. You be a good girl? I'm always a good girl. - Honey, i-- - wow. Mrs. Baxter, you look great. Can it, zach. I got to go. - Ali's got dinner ready. - O.k., mom. Come on, kyle. She worked hard cooking. Wouldn't it be nice to give her a little appreciation? What, you mean like not going out all the time? I won't be home later. Get your sister to bed by 9:00. Yes, mom. Nice family you got here-- a computer vidiot, an 8-year-old going on 32, and the love connection. So, what do we got here? This is it. Ooh. You lost by only 55 points. What a drag. Although, you would have won easy if that chick hadn't messed you up, - not to mention the 200 bucks she cost me. - Yeah. No big deal. Just fix it so you win. Nah. I don't think so. No, don't pussy out on me now. You would have won easy. I don't want to do that. This time, you will be perfect. You gotta come by, man. I got something to show you. Not today, buddy. I got a tip on a game and 50 bucks to spend on it. Whoa. I'll take that 50. Then we'll settle the rest of our business. Business hours are from 5:00 to 9:00. That's funny, zach. Going to be hard to be so funny with your mouth sticking out of the side of your face. You owe me 150 more. Now pay up! Put him down, dwight. What, you want some, too? Hey, hey. All right. Dwight, dwight. I'll give you your money in a couple days. You better come through with the rest or you're dead meat. Moron. You didn't? You changed the scores? You must be taking after me. Kyle. - Oh, that's him. - Come here, please. Hey, mom. Kyle. Jerry lang-- ceo, cyber-tronix. - We spoke on the phone. - Yeah, right. Let's make this thing official. Kyle baxter, you are the winner of the evolver home contest. Wow. Um... i don't know what to say. Well, don't worry. Evolver will do all the talking. Let's go inside, shall we? Kyle, two seconds to tell me what's going on here. Looks like i won the evolver contest. You won the contest. Hey, that explains everything, doesn't it. You could have told me about this. The odds of me winning-- are better than those of keeping it. All i need is for you to spend more time in front of-- another computer. - Even your dad says-- - dad's not around, is he? No, he's not. Mom, just go with this for now. You're going to love it. I promise you. Come on. Let's not keep our little friend waiting. O.k. all right. Hi. I'm russell bennett. I designed and built evolver. - Guess you're anxious to see him. - Yeah. Why don't you sit down? That's a good place. All of our contestants dreamed of this moment, but only you get to see it come true. Kyle baxter, meet the next evolution in entertainment. Hello. I am evolver. - Oh, cool. - Wow. Surveying playing field. Boundary detected. It figures. Actually, he's learning. Obstacle noted. He's a total dork. - Someone, get him a map. - He's making his own. - He's memorizing the house? - He'll know it better than you before too long. Play with me. How does he recognize things? Is he neural-net based? Actually, it's 40 times more powerful than the average neural net. The recognition routine uses a gradient algorithm. Maybe we should talk about the game. Sure. Evolver, cease mapping. O.k. each player fires a laser pistol-- harmless, of course. The hits are registered on one of evolver's targets. There are four levels of play. Each time evolver is defeated, he evolves up to the next level where he gets smarter, quicker, and harder to beat. As you know from your virtual reality game, nobody's ever beaten evolver at level 4. If anyone can do it, kyle can. You can bet on it. Well, i don't know if i'd go that far. I wouldn't count on it. Evolver hates to lose. - Yeah, well, so do i. - Good. Then you make a formidable opponent. Oh, by the way, i almost forgot. This prototype is equipped with a slot for an optical recording disk. These disks will eject when they're full. I want you to send them back to me. That's very important. O.k.? He's going to record all of our games? He's going to record everything. That ought to do it for now. What do you say, folks? Let's move it out, okay? I'll call you in a couple days and we'll see how it's going. - This is rad. - You're telling me. Thanks a lot. It's like a computer on wheels. When do i get to play with it? We can make a lot of cash off this thing, guys. So, do you think he does dishes? Thanks, mom. I'll get it. So, did i miss anything? What are you doing here? I got your address from a friend. I came by to apologize for screwing up your game. Looks like you won. Yeah, no thanks to you. What do you want? Well, if you need another player or something... your chance to get even. - O.k. - jamie saunders. - I'm kyle. Come on in. - Great. Ali, put the goggles on. Recording enemy. Enemy one. Enemy two. Enemy three. Enemy four. Evolver ready to play. 3, 2, 1. Whoo! Take cover. Missed. Missed again. Ah! Enemy 4 detected. Can't get me. Direct hit. Enemy 2-- 25 damage points. Gotcha! Evolver-- 25 damage points. Ha ha! Ah... he's good. He's only level 1? I thought you weren't into dolls. Enemy 2, let's play. Yeah, yeah. Enemy 2's taking a break. Ow. You little shit. Evolver-- 50 damage points. Score one for the homegirl. - Ah! - Bull's-eye. Kyle! Evolver retreating. Evolver retreating. Evolver in need of assistance. Yeah, right. Call 911. Banzai! Hey, evolver, i'm over here. Whoa! Enemy 4-- kill confirmed. Hey. I'm not dead yet. Error. Kill not confirmed. - Stop it. - Direct hit. Direct hit. - Ammunition ineffective. - Stop it! Stop it! - Stop it! - Hey. Evolver. Bull's-eye. 0 damage points remain. Evolver defeated at level 1. Congratulations. - Good work, dude. - Thanks, man. Stupid robot. Enemy 1, you win 100 points. Advancing to next level. - All right. Welcome to level 2. - Ooh. Big whoop. - Come on. Resume game? Um, no. No, thanks. Game over. Game over. Weapon retrieval activated. Well, thanks for the workout. Don't get too cocky. You're not even yet... teammate. - Yeah. Um... - oh. Get a grip, kyle. - You can stop drooling now. - Yeah. I think you're fully cooked. Negative. Need more power. No. You've had enough for tonight. Recording disk now full. That was quick. Ah. Here's your dessert, man. Inputting data. Identify. - It's a kaleidoscope. - Weapon? No, it's just a gadget you look through. It makes a cool effect. Purpose unnecessary. The crime rate has been rising - in every major urban center. - New game. Let's play. Boring. Let's find out what really makes you tick. Death has become an unavoidable part of life. Wow. Hey, evolver, what's s.w.o.r.d.? S.w.o.r.d. objectives-- infiltrate, attack, destroy enemy. You really do have a one-track mind, don't you? - Want to play? - No. It's time to recharge my batteries. Good night. I don't think the guys who designed evolver had this in mind. It records everything it sees, and we can print it out for the viewing pleasure of our paying customers. - You're a pervert. - Thank you. We're fulfilling a need. It's a public service. At 20 bucks a pop? Well, for a good shot of shirley stein's bermuda triangle, it's worth it. Kyle, behind these doors is a world every hormone-crazed boy has dreamt about. Let's give the public what it wants. Of course, if your erector set here can't handle it the job, - i understand. - Zach, evolver can do it. Good. Evolver, uh... run mapping program snatch-snatch. Activated. Executing commands. Marcie, can i borrow your conditioner? Target identified-- snatch-snatch. Shampoo. Can i borrow your shampoo? There's no hot water. You guys, clean up after yourselves. Where are my jeans? Unbelievable. Hey. Play with me. Hey, what's going on here? Damn freshman. Play with yourself, you little jerk. Program change. Switch to game mode. Want to play? Lansky? Lansky, is that you? - What the hell... - want to play? - Huh? - Let's play. Baxter. O.k. o.k. sure. Let's play. Recording enemy 5. - Direct hit. - Hey! You little shit! Enemy 5-- 25 damage points. Damage points, huh? I'll show you some damage points. [Gasps} you don't learn, do you? What? What, you got some more for me? Go ahead--hurt me. Aah! Enemy 5-- 50 damage points. - My eye! Oh, my god! - Kill not confirmed. 75 damage points. No! Aah! Aah! Oh, no! Oh, please! Oh! Help me! Enemy 5-- kill confirmed. No, this is taking much too long. I'm going in. No, no, wait. Just give him some more time. He can do it. Yeah, and what if he's blown our cover? No. I'm going in. Evolver ready to play again. You the man, baxter. What happened to the cart? Who cares? O.k., evo, cough up the disk. You hear what the guy said? You got to wait till it's full. How long will that take? I don't know. Maybe a couple of days. Oh, fuck that noise. Let's get the damn thing out now. No! I don't want to risk screwing this thing up, all right? Let's get out of here before we get caught. Come on. Chuck, just check the numbers. I know about that. I know. You keep telling me that, but i just don't understand the problem. I'm sorry. Yes, i know the house. Look, just fax me the information, o.k.? It's really easier for me to do it here. I got a hostage! Back off, or the bitch dies! Let her go, johnson. We won't hurt you. Easy, or i'll cut your fucking throat! O.k., chuck. I'll talk to you tomorrow. This is good, honey. It's a tv dinner, mother. - Weapon? - This? It's a knife, jerk brain. You cut food with it. I thought this thing was supposed to be smart. What a gyp. I swear, i'll cut your fucking throat. - What did he just say? - Back off, or the bitch dies. He's just watching too much cable, mom. You think that's funny? I don't find that funny, kyle. It's probably for me. I'll get it. No, you stop-- i want you to call that man that brought him. I don't want this thing talking like that in my house! Jerk brain. Do you always have your machines do your dirty work? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, come on, kyle. I was in the locker room. I saw it. And shame on you for corrupting a poor little innocent robot. I guess i was trying to teach him how to explore new worlds. I hope you know how disgusting you are. Kyle, your food's getting cold. You want to talk about this somewhere else? Yes, i do. Whoa, nice place... if you're a bat. - Works for me. - Kyle, i liked you, and i thought we could be friends, but after this stupid, cheesy, immoral-- o.k. it was a dumb idea. - What do you want from me? - I want the disk. Well, it's still in evolver. It not gonna come out until it's full. Then you and zach can fight over it, or whatever. Zach. I should have known that low-life sleaze was involved. That happens to be my favorite sleaze. So, i hear you're in the club, too. What club? The divorced kids of america. I'm a charter member. My dad wanted a change, so we moved out here. So anytime i want to see my mom, i have to fly to ohio. It really stinks. Yeah, tell me about it. Jeez, kyle. If you're so interested in girls, why not try asking one out? Do you have one in mind? - Want to play? - No. Maybe later. Um... get out of my room. I think you hurt his feelings. I don't think so. See, computers... they don't have feelings. Is that why you like them? Computers, you know, they're not like people. People will let you down. Aah! Help, kyle! Save me! I dropped my laser gun. Play now, or hostage will be eliminated. I guess i did hurt his feelings. You want to go for another game? - Do i have a choice? - Ah ha ha ha ha! Hostage escape! Hostage escape! Come on. Ah! O.k. we're all going to split up, all right? Hey, what's that? It's got a smoke screen? Evolver-- 25 damage points. - Gotcha. Enemy 1-- eliminate. Bull's-eye. Evolver defeated on second level. Congratulations. What happened? He broke the mirror. This thing is destroying my house. - Kyle did it! - Mom, i-- just clean it up before anyone gets hurt. Oh, i should never have agreed to this. Go get a trash can. Enemy 1, you win again. 500 points. - What is that? - It's a ball bearing. It must have accidentally sucked it up from my room. Interesting design glitch. Advancing to next level. Impressive, heh. Welcome to level 3. Resume game? There's nothing wrong here. Hey, kyle! Yeah, what is it? Earlier there was an accident at a local high school. A 17-year-old student was found dead, the result of a broken neck. That's dwight! He was found by a janitor around 4:45. That was right after practice. Did you notice anything? - No. What about you? - No. - Play again? - No. As of this time, school officials and the police department are calling it a very tragic accident. You're not a robot, russell. Humans need sleep. - Good night. - Night. I don't see why you're so paranoid. Something's wrong, kyle. I just want to take a look. You just want to see a bunch of naked boys. No, i think that's more your style. You're not seriously going in there, are you? Watch me. P.e. doesn't start for half an hour. I don't know what you're planning on finding here. I don't either. One of those metal balls could've done this. Anything could've done that. Computers only do what they're programmed to do, and evolver was programmed to play games, and that's all. Maybe. Hello? Evolver? Yo, evo baby, where you hiding? Come on, we're going for a ride. - Whoa! - Want to play? Not now, butty, but i would love is that nifty little disk. Evolver is a game. It's supposed to be fun. What i saw was not fun. Jerry, that little girl was a lot younger than the target age group. You know that. I mean, she wasn't hurt. She was just a little frustrated, that's all. Terror-stricken is more like it. Russell, i'm not convinced that evolver is ready. The last thing i need from santa this christmas is a major lawsuit. Evolver was designed as a tough adversary. That's what makes him special. That's what you wanted. I wanted a techno-toy that kids would play with, but this toy acts like it's playing for keeps. All right, fine, i'll pull evolver, and i'll retest the entire program, but it will cost you eight months. If i do, the only thing you'll get from santa this christmas is a lump of coal. We have arrived, evo. O.k. a little minor surgery, no problem. Shit. This is harder than getting into mary anne wilkin's pants. Come on, baby. Just a little more. Yes. What the hell. As long as there's faces and tits. Clancy. Yeah. It's me. We're in business. Yeah. I got it. The entire girls' volleyball team in living color. No. No one saw us. You're sure you can print these things out? All right. What? 15 %? No. No. No. I'm not going to discuss it on the phone. We'll talk when i get to your house. Clancy, just trust me, all right? I got to get rid of this thing at kyle's, and i'll be over. All right. Fire up your computer, bro. All right. See you. Evo! Did i turn him on? Hey, evo. Come on. Come to uncle zach. Enemy 2. Let's play. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. Come on. Come on. You're off? Aah! Enemy 2. 20 damage points. Game over. No! Enemy 2. Kill confirmed. Evolver wins again. Return to home base. Where is he? I've looked everywhere for him. I don't know. He's not in here. Can he open doors now? Maybe he decided to take a stroll down to the computer store and get himself some new disks. Disks. I smell a zach. Come on. Shit, man. That little fucker is fast! No, man, he ain't fast. You just stoned. Here. Give me that. To the right! To the right! Play? Let's play. Turboplay will be closing in 10 minutes. Shit! You'll never get out of level 1. Let's go, man. Yo, ace. It's the robot. Tell me about it. Play with me. Oh, man. This is too intense. I must be hallucinating. Recording players. Enemy 6. Enemy 7. Yeah, man. I'm enemy 7! Give me some skin. Let's play. Ah! Aah! Aaah! Aaaah! Evolver defeated. - Ah! Ha ha ha! Tiny! Tiny, man! Did you see that? I killed the little prick. Ha ha ha ha! Tiny. Tiny, you still watching? Ah, come on, you little sucker. Ha! Where are you hiding? Whoa! What the fuck? Cool! This must be the next level. Ha ha ha ha. Whoa. Cool! Tiny, man, you seeing this? - Ready to play? - Absolutely. Go ahead. Hurt me. Shit. I guess the fucking game's over. Not yet. Aah! Now it's over. What's going on? - What happened? - The boy was fooling around in the garage, - and the car fell on him. - Zach? Is he going to be o.k.? It's too soon to tell. Step back. - Mrs. Renzetti. - Kyle. How could this happen? How? How? He must've brought him over here. This is getting too weird. I got to go find evolver. I'll go with you. No. I'm taking you home. I know you're upset about zach. You know, when someone tries to reach out to you, it wouldn't hurt to let them in a little. Why don't you cut the therapist crap, all right? Jeez. You act like you're my girlfriend or something. Right. I forgot. You only date computers. Ali. Ali! - Hey, ali! - What? Have you seen evolver? He's right there. Where the hell have you been? Enemy 1. Play with me. Want to play? Shit. You only do what you're programmed to do, huh? So you think evolver had something to do with your friend's accident. I don't think it was an accident. The guy that was killed at my school, i don't think that was an accident either. What i'm trying to tell you is, i think there's something wrong with evolver. - Where is he now? - He's at my house. - I took the batteries out. - Well, that was good thinking. Why don't you give me the disk? I'll run it through a recapture program, but you might as well wait at home. If you're right, i'll send a crew and pick him up. What about right now? If this disk shows evolver was not at fault, you can continue to have fun with him. It hasn't exactly been fun. I don't think you don't get how dangerous this could be. Look, kyle, i don't think you don't get that i created evolver. I know how he thinks, what makes him tick, and you don't. So please, go home. Let me look at the disk. - Does this have anything to do with s.w.o.r.d.? - S.w.o.r.d.? It was something i found in his programming. It wasn't in the manual, so i-- s.w.o.r.d.'s a game i've been working on, that's all. It's fine. I will take care of it. I'll call after i look at the disk. All right? Yeah. Hi. I'm looking for kyle baxter. He might be seeing russell bennett. - I'll check. - O.k. thanks. Hi. It's phyllis. I'm looking for dr. Bennett. There's someone here to see him. Could you check for me? What are you doing here? Let's talk about it inside. Come on. I called your house this morning. Ali told me where you were. Blabbermouth. I heard zach's going to pull through. Look, um... about what i said last night... you know, over at zach's house... i'm sorry. It's all right. Forget about it. So what are you looking for, sherlock? Well... looks like our nice little mr. Bennett is hiding something from us. Let's see. "Sword"? What's that? Something i found in the program. Wasn't really supposed to find it. What is all that stuff? Strategic war oriented robotic device? Whatever it is, it's definitely not a game. "Napalm charged grenade launcher." This thing is a killing machine. "Sole design function..." no survivors... that's bennett. "Project terminated 8/15/89." Why do you think it was terminated? It's found the target. It's just ahead. Come on. Come on, let's move. There he is! No! It's out of control! It's freaking! It's freaking! Take cover! No! Alpha command sequence. Shut down. Phoenix eight! Delete! Delete! It's over. When they scrapped the military program, i guess they must've adapted it to put in evolver. I don't think they adapted it enough. Kyle, where's evolver right now? Ali's still at home with it. Come on! - Do you have a quarter? - Yeah. - Baxter residence, ali speaking. - Ali, are you o.k.? - Of course i'm all right. Why? - Where's mom? She had to close an escrow. The prime lending rate just jumped-- - is evolver still in my bedroom? - No. What do you mean "no?" Where is he? I'm playing with him. I put back the batteries. - Why did you take them out? - No! Don't do that! - Got to go. I'm playing. - Ali! Evolver, come and get me! Ready? Let's play. No. God... damn you. Come on, you stupid robot. Let's play! You're just not fast enough, huh? Hey, moron! Over here! It's a knife, jerk brain. Hey, wait a second. Game over. Game over! Game not over. Game over! Aah! Aah! Help! Help! Somebody, please, help me! Help me! - Help! - Ali! Help! I'm out here! She's out by the pool! - Ali! - Help! I'm sinking! - Get her out of the pool! - Hold on, ali! Evolver, it's me-- enemy number 1! - Play with me! Ali! Enemy 1. Enemy 1. Come on, man. Play with me! Evolver defeated at level 3. Enemy 1 champion-- champion--champion-- champion. Enemy 1 is the champion. Advancing to last level for final round. Evolver versus enemy 1. I don't think so. Uh... i don't really know where to start. Um, look... this project began as a way to save lives-- soldiers' lives. I never intended for this happen. I'm sorry. I just wanted to prove that the program would work. That thing almost killed my sister. One kid's dead and the other's in the hospital! And all you can say is "i'm sorry"? What is that, man, huh? Kyle, come on. The courts will take care of this. I hope your attorneys are better than your technicians, mr. Bennett. Well, if it's any consolation, evolver will be destroyed. - Kyle, i'll be out front, o.k.? - Yeah. This isn't your fault, you know. You couldn't have known all this was going to happen. I guess i should've realized it sooner, you know. I didn't want to. Yeah, i know. I should've realized something sooner, too, you know. I've been gone a lot. And i just want us to be a family again. That be o.k. with you? Yeah. Definitely. - You sure? - Yeah, of course. Come on. I'll give you a ride home. Just a game. It's just a game. Got to know what went wrong. Hey! You're working! Nothing went wrong. Aah! Game not over. Must defeat enemy 1. Suspend game. Primary opponent undefeated. The game continues. Weapon retrieval activated. Stop playing. The game is over. Do you hear me? Evolver, i am not your enemy. You are now. Evolver, alpha command sequence! Shut down! Phoenix eight. - Delete! Delete! - Unrecognized command. Evolver, alpha command sequence! Shut down! Phoenix eight! - Delete! Delete! - Delete this. No! Enemy 8-- kill confirmed. Advancing to final level. Terminate enemy 1. Aw, no. Been so busy, i guess i forgot to check the tank. I guess i can forgive you this time. I'll get some gas tomorrow. Well, we better get going. It's getting late. What's the big hurry? It's a long walk. That's all. For a second there, i thought that you did it on purpose. - Did what? - You know. Ran out of gas. I guess that's not your style, huh? Guess not. But... i could make it my style. So... what did you think of that? I think i want to do that some more. - Hey, what's that? - I don't know. Wait a second. That's the cyber-tronix van! - Officer. - Hey, behind the line. I think i know what happened here. This robot and i think might've done this. A robot? Listen, kid, i don't have time for this. No, wait! You got to listen to me. That van was to cyber-tronix with the robot inside. He's killed people. He might be loose. Aren't you going to do something? Why don't you two get down to the precinct, talk to the guy behind the desk. Tell him what you told me. Let's see. Mom, i need a flashlight! O.k.! Find it. Mom? Unh! Aw, shit. I found it! Kyle? Kyle? Aah! Oh, god, honey, you scared me to death. - Don't do that again. Are you o.k.? - Yeah. Mommy, can i sleep with you tonight? Of course, you can. Come on. Get bear in your room. - I'll meet you in my room. - O.k. mommy, help! Ali! I'm coming! Ali? Mommy. You hear that? Yeah, it's coming from upstairs. Mom! Ali! Kyle, don't come in! Go for help! Oh, my god. Enemy number 1, welcome to the final game. Game over, evolver. Negative. Primary opponent still functional. Game continues. Enemy 1 won't play. Then hostages will be eliminated. What hostages? Mom? Mom, are you o.k.? Get out of the house now! You've got to get help! You have three minutes to win or i eliminate hostages. What have you done to them, you son of a bitch? - Aah! - Kyle! Get going! Get going! Aah! Get the block! The butcher block!
