* APACHE DRUMS * In 1880 The drums of the Mescalero Apaches carried the crash trunder of Chieff Victorio's words over the waterless moutains of the south west. White men from the North and white men from Mexico. They opened a path in the middle of the land that fed us. We cannot go south to take Mescal. Nor to the north to eat the pine nuts. We are hungry in our veins. Soon our warriors will be weak to fight. Then white men will drive us out of our lands. And only the empty sky will hear the voices of the Mescaleros. A hungry people rose to fight. Their fury fell upon settled places where peace ful Americans carried on trade and welsh miners dug for silver. One of these places was the town of Spanish Boot. Water! Fresh water! Clean water! Good morning, Mr. Kitty! Do you want water? No! Want milk! Come here, kitten. If you look back you will see that it was in self-defense. It's true, Mayor. They shot him. Well, it seems so. Despite this, Sam, you will have to leave Spanish Boot. I'd like to ask the citizens... Speak well, Sam, but there's no way you can stay here. You win too much. But isn't that a crime? I don't want to talk about it. One thing is right. You'll have to leave town. It's fine with me. There is no place for a man of my worth here in Spanish Boot! You will feel very alone, Joe. They won't miss you. Maybe not, but I repeat, you will feel lonely. Are you talking about Sally? I say you're alone. I repeat, I want you to leave until noon. Good morning, Reverend. Good morning, Joe. You did an excellent job, Joe. Wait a minute! I can't now reverend. You are a blacksmith and mayor here, Madden. Reverend, you Gauls are funny... you don't live well alone, I got rid of a bad element. That was the beginning. Don't you want a good city? Then you must cut all the dry branches. I think you're right. We will! I don't know why a dance hall in a city of hard work. The money would be better used for a school and streets. Jehu! Call us the "cheerful woman", Which leads the people to misery. And the feet guide her to death. I think you're talking about Miss. Careless, you're not a reverend. I already know what they want... The mine is doing very well. And we don't have hostile Indians around here. The city is thriving, it's time to clean it up from the rascals. Woman, Gentlemen, I am far above you. Make a good offer for this bar and I'll take my girls... to a very cheerful city. Woman his name is Babylon and it is abominable! Don't insult me! Just make an offer for the building. Remember, I won't lose! You know, Frank, this place wouldn't be bad for a warehouse. Just close some windows, open a bigger door and set up the warehouse. I've thought about it. When you decide, let me know. I'll take the girls to Silver Springs. Are you going out of town, Sat String? Maybe I will. But my name is Leeds. My friends call me that. I thought you were my friend. Of course, Leeds... of course! Good morning, Sam Sleak! My name is Leeds. It's what friends call me. I am not your friend. What do you want for breakfast? Do you know. I'll get it. Sally, wait, I can eat later. I'm going to... get out of Spanish Boot. I heard about the shooting. There are other cities, some are fun and some are not. Let's find a fun one, if you come with me. Since I arrived, we've had a lot of fun, Sally. We had a lot of fun. And then? Sam, you know what I think about you. You are the most fun friend I've ever had. But I want more than that. If you want to get married... Reverend Griffin, you can join us before we leave. It wouldn't change things, Sam. I'm thinking about roses. I think I'm the only girl in the world... who received roses coming from 300 km away for the anniversary. It is very beautiful when you think about it. But how did you get money, Sam? From Warren Roy, in the game... It was my lucky day. Roy, you didn't think so, Sam. You played with him last night. And now he is dead. I told you, he shot first. This has nothing to do with us, Sally. It has everything to do with us. When you reach another city you will do the same thing. I don't want to participate in that. Some men have to sweat for what they want. I just get paid, that's exactly what I know how to do. It could be good and honest. I saw my father working as a slave in a mine. He died young and poor. He was an honest man. I never wanted to be that. I am honest enough, to tell you that and come with me. You have to go without me, Sam. Maybe it's selfishness. What I want is what every woman wants, I want a house, a place in the city to live and a decent husband. It looks like everything is arranged with Joe Madden. Don't be stupid, I'm not talking about Joe and anyone. But I'm talking about how I feel. Understand it! Yes, I am beginning to understand many things. I didn't see how the cards were marked. It looks like Joe Madden has a lot more reasons... to get rid of me than I thought. I will stay for a while. This is the healthiest donkey I've ever seen, Chacho. He runs so much, he jumps so much... Maybe he's nervous, don't you think? Ah!... This is the evil of youth! In a few years it will be cured. Do you think at noon Chacho? The sun is straight ahead. Sam! It's past noon, Sam. I have a watch. But I changed my mind. I decided to stay here in Spanish Boot. I don't remember giving you a choice. There is no complaint against me that I could hold on a jury. My decision is that you are not good for this city... maybe it?s not cool, but I?m not going to change it. It is a convenient decision. That will leave you free for Sally. It is exactly the decision that a hypocritical fellow like you would make. I already said you're leaving. Drop it! Get up and go! Look Sam, this is not between you and me... and it has nothing to do with Sally. You?re leaving, with Betty and her girls, because it?s not good for the city. Nor is the city for you. Don't send me away without my gun. The road to Silver Springs is pretty safe. Much safer for you than Spanish Boot. If you hurry you can catch up with the girls. They will be a good company for you on the way! Goodbye Gaby! Bye!... Bye!... Mr... Sam! Don't take it off! They scalped me. The Apaches... Mescaleros apaches... Mescaleros? Yes. They were behind the gorge. There were many of them... Mescaleros... A hundred, maybe two hundred. They came out of the rocks like ghosts. They are cruel. Their hearts are evil. They did not come shouting or screaming. Will you notify the city, Mr. Sam? Clear. You must go and warn them! Of course I will. The Mescaleros are close to the city! They attacked Betty and the girls in the gorge! They come here! Listen, you have to hear me. I came back just to warn you. Let's go outside! What happened, Sam? Look, I had no reason to come back here. The Mescaleros, are on a war footing! Get ready! Pedro Peter! Pedro Peter is, a scout for Fort Cook. Say it. Where are the Mescaleros? The troops have confronted Vitorio two days ago. The Mescaleros went, to the border with Mexico. Were you in the fight? It's true Sam, there are no Indians here to scare us. Did you really see any Indians? Did you see? Yes. Why would I lie to you, Joe? I do not know that. But whatever the reason will not go ahead with this one. Sally, tell them I can be anything, but I don't lie. Tell them! I'm not lying! The Indians killed Betty and the girls! It must have been a bunch of Indians to bring him back. But we don't want it here. I will not leave again! These good citizens will be able to help you out. Throw him out! Throw him out! Give me a hand! It's an Apache arrow! It was an ambush! I think you were right. When this is over... When it is over you will leave the city. I heard the arguments, I still think we should send a messenger to the Fort. The mayor said it was not worth the risk. It is better to risk, a man than the whole city. Well, since most people think, we should send a message. Who wants to take a walk? I don't mind going. It's too young. The boy knows how to ride. As you know? I have to know, I'm your father! Are the Indians perhaps waiting? Let me ride my own horse and no indigenous horse will catch me. You don't have to go. Sam... I regret what happened today in front of the church. But I couldn't say anything. I think not. Here inside my heart, I believe in you. But I couldn't tell them that I wasn't lying. What I feel proves nothing. It's ok. I was trying to explain... It's ok. You already apologized. Try to understand. Yes I understand. You want me to be as good as Joe. I want it to be good, as I believe Sam Leeds is. Sam Leeds, who came to prevent a city that expelled him... Let's not talk about it now! I came back, we are together. You don't want to hear. Come on out, I have to close the store. Where is he going? To the Fort. Will he make it? Maybe yes. Maybe not. You speak well, perhaps you should speak to the mayor. About what? Lieutenant Glidden said to wait for him. Tomorrow he comes here. Why did you send the boy? It won't do me any good to talk to the mayor. You are a white man. There are whites that other whites don't believe in. What boy were you talking about? Do Bert Keon. Does Peter think he can be killed? Exactly. Didn't you even try to talk to Joe? Wouldn't he believe me? Even you told him that I am not sincere. Good luck, Bert! Did you want to say something to Bert? Not at all. He's a good knight. You will do it. Can I accompany you, even home? Clear. I'm sorry, Sam came back. I expected him to go to Silver Springs and miss him. Miss me... Get a job and come and get me. It can still happen, Sally. I thought he would change, having to go back to the city... but it hasn't changed. It remains the same "Sam". I am the same. And I still feel the same way about him. What am I going to do, Joe? I dont know. I hoped Sam wouldn't come back. It is a pity that you only like bad men and want to change them. Shouldn't he be back by now? Don't worry, with your son Ms. Keon, he rides very well and is a smart guy. Yes, Bert is a smart boy, to be caught by the Indians. Damn, what's up? Please take it, Mrs. Keon, though! Please, Mrs. Keon! Calm! Help her! Calm! Nobody wants to drink this water. The Mescaleros threw the boy's body into the well. Perhaps it will return life to the trees. What they said? It is thirsty? But it is the law of the Apaches! Don't touch the dead. Do not touch the things that the dead person touched. Come on, I'll buy you a beer. The white man has a law. Give neither beer nor whiskey to the Indians. The law is meaningless now that there is no water to drink. We will. Two beers, Sally. He knows that it is against the law to sell drinks to the Indians. But you're selling it to me. Sit down! Take it. I took one just now. Do any of you have water? We are storing water, for women and children. I have some water in the kitchen. Yesterday's water. Thank you Miss. Come with me, Mr. Keon. We better get together to get water. It has already been discussed. The mayor has decided that we will wait for the patrol. That decision should have made it last night. The decision to send young Keon to the fort was made by everyone. Not just for Joe Madden. Now, it is our decision and his, too, that we hope. If 10 men were willing, I am a volunteer to fetch water. I have a cart and a belly. If you want I can go too. We already have one! You have no right to do this! I don't like to see women and children thirsty, Reverend. Count on me! We already have two. Who else? It looks like we already have a train! Prepare you the cart. It is leading these men to death! They are volunteers. Come on, guys! Joe Madden, you might want to know this! Do you know what you're doing, Sam? Fetching water. For women and children? Exactly! You didn't care much about Bert Keon... yesterday, he was also almost a child. This is different. I would like to believe... but I know you, it seems like an opportunity to humiliate the mayor. The mayor who sent him away from the city... and did not believe him when he returned. You know me very well, Sally! It doesn't make sense guys. will have to go to Blue Canyon to get water... and they will be slaughtered there. We want water for women and children. If I asked them, maybe he said they prefer their husbands and fathers alive... than the promise of water that will never come! I told them I was going to say that. We have already decided. So you?ve already decided, right guys? Yes, that's right. I have no other choice. If they are willing to die, there is nothing to do. I wouldn't want to get my hands dirty with blood. Here! Take a decent gun. Thank you! Hey, Sam! Guess who's in the cart! What are you doing here? Maybe they need help! I thought you were against it. And I'm. I think there is time to return before being attacked by the Indians. We have come this far, I think, that we can continue. You will help us fill the barrels, Reverend. Whoa!... Drink at will! Then we will fill the barrels. I don't see any Indian faces. Indians are children of the devil. Their eyes are watchful. They know we're here. They must be looking the other way. All right, guys, let's fill the barrels! Keep your eyes open for the Indians. Indians! Indians! The Indians are coming! We are happy to see you Lieutenant Glidden. Problems? The Indians are on a war footing. We tried to send a message to the fort but the boy was killed. They were very lucky to have lost only one man. Victorio is close to the border with 200 warriors. Colonel Haven and the Second Cavalry cut their trail yesterday. Some of the men doubted that you would come... and went to get water. Do you think there is no danger? Do not know. I learned not to underestimate the Apaches. They move as quickly on foot, as on horseback, find water anywhere, and survive a lack of food. They can be anywhere. Where did your men go? A Boy Canyon. Boy Canyon? We'd better go over there to help them get back. Good!... Wait for me, I will go with you. It's ok. I liked your sermon Reverend who said that the Apaches... they are devils that God created, to tempt honest men. I am saved and I am not honest! It is better to boast about something else than your lack of honesty. I can boast of going so far to get water. While the mayor is terrified of leaving the city. Yes, you can boast about it! Maybe that's the only reason I'm here. Apaches! Let's run away, quickly! Mescaleros! Go on! Go on! I only have 3 bullets. What about you? Wait, don't shoot! If we were going to die, shoot that one, shoot the Chief. Not in a red shirt? Yes. You were right, Reverend! I had little to do with the Indians. But I heard a lot. I never imagined that they were going to be afraid of two helpless men? I shot the Chief. I think we should thank God for this miracle. Perhaps. You look tired, Reverend. Let's rest. When I was just a boy in Wales, I would never think that I would sit in the middle of the great American desert, next to a player like you... and the screams of the Indians continue to ring in my ears. If someone told me yesterday that I would sit next to a preacher... I wouldn't believe it. Thank you for staying with me. I would not have done well alone. I stayed here for the sake of others. Reverend. Give a dog an ugly name and everyone will throw stones at it. Of course, I play. And I drink too. I killed a man who was trying to kill me. This country is tough everyone has to defend themselves. You do not work. He makes fun of those who work. You don't care about others. This is what makes your life an offense, even for Sally, who loves him. I could tell you, what I think about it, but it?s useless here in the desert. Come on! Another bunch of Mescaleros! May be! It could also be the same bunch coming back. Devil creatures playing cat and mouse to torture us. We have no bullets, no protection. Nor is anything worth taking a last look at! It is the land of God man. I would not reject her at the time of her death. And the Lord, will you pray? I've been talking to Him all my life. I feel like I'm guilty of being here. I don't have to blame you for anything. If it makes you feel better. You are right. About what? I never really cared if the city needed water. I just wanted to prove that I was smart. I wanted Sally to see this and make Joe a fool. Now I wanted her to see how I was wrong. About many things! She will know. The best card always comes after the game is over. It's always like that. Look. Soldiers! Yes, they are soldiers! Soldiers! Water! Here! Thank you! Calm! I was surprised to see them with hair on their heads. But the Apaches have a saying... "Never trust the eyes of a man who runs away". What you mean? He said you were left behind fighting... against a bunch of Indians. They walked fast, but I would say there were about 30. And you are here! Sam killed the boss and they left. Was he a big Indian in a red shirt? Yes, it was. Your city is saved, Mayor. This man appears to have killed or injured Victorio. They will not attack if he died. They will spend some time watching. Victorio is the very souls of the Mescaleros... the prophet, priest and war chief all in one. If you were one of my men you would get a promotion. Since he is one of my lieutenants, did one thing staying behind fighting... while the others ran back. A good thing. It wasn't what you intended, Joe. Now I ask you to stop this man. Like? Because? He disobeyed my orders by risking the lives of ten men. You are asking to go beyond my authority. The army only obeys federal laws. So you have no choice but to stop this man. As mayor, I accuse Sam Leeds, of serving drink to an Indian. I just gave you a beer! The man was thirsty the water was polluted. Does the law allow exceptions, Lieutenant? I'm afraid not. I know there is a rivalry between you two, Joe. But I ask you to think before you decide. I don't want to do it anymore, I am obliged. The next time he goes against authority, we won't be so lucky. Sam Leeds and I fought together, we saw death catching up with us. I know this man. There's kindness in it, the kind of kindness that would help, a city you love so much, Joe. Thank you, Reverend. I caused this myself. You know he can get 20 years, in prison for giving an Indian drink. Are you sure. I'm sure! Thus. Mr. Leeds, against my will, I am obliged to stop you. Present weapons! Lieutenant Glidden said they will be leaving in an hour. I came to say goodbye. I'll get you a farewell drink! What are you doing now? They are burying Betty and the girls. Bert, he's having military honors, since he died as a soldier. Thank you. Maybe I won't be back anytime soon, Sally. Funny there in the desert, I saw things clear. Too late! I stole my whole life and did well... and now for being right they arrest me out of kindness. I don't think it will be for very long. You will believe me this time, Sally, If I said I would try. It is important that you believe. You know is the only way to know that you will be waiting for me when I leave. Rest, weapons! Prepare! To point! Shoot! Back off! Run! When there is time. I'll stay! Please run away! I stay with you There's no point in dying, you can't help me. Go for me! I will not leave you. Take the gun! Put here. We will! Run! It is? You are a prisoner of Lieutenant Glidden. I can't fight it. They'll need everyone's help. We are protected. The walls are thick, the doors are old, but they are oak. Bring it here! The keys are in my pocket. You are not protected. This place is difficult to defend. Look the windows are too high. We cannot shoot out but they can scale the walls. It has too many windows, and we are few. We have no food or water. No dressings. The warriors, the brave Mescaleros. They will come through the windows. Please! What time is it? The large hand and the small hand point to the West. 8 h 45. We will wear our men's belts. Here is mine. I always thought it was an American custom to wear two belts. One for pants, one for weapons. I need a belt. You don't wear pants. Come here Roy, you are very light. Get up here while we hold you. It looks like it works! Watch out Roy! I don't know anything about magic, but look at the work I know how to do. Look at this! Magic! Listen, there would be no Indians around if you children didn't cry. Here look! Where did it go? There's one right here! Where did the other go? It's with you. The magician opened the show now it's time for the singer. I can't sing, I don't know what to sing! I don't know anything about magic either! Go, sing anything. Do you know this song? What happened, Bob? Why didn't you scream when you saw the Apaches? I didn't see anyone, the boy hid the Apaches from my view. I take Bob's place, a little. He is tired. We chained the dogs in Wales, even a dog would go against its owner, to protect another dog. That man is an Apache. Pedro Peter! These handcuffs are government property, you are a soldier... take care of them. You may regret this. They started! Does it sound like dance music? It is the terrible music of the pagan. Our guests are having a ball outside. You can go down. I watch now. There's water? Not a drop. I'm not really thirsty it's just the music. Yeah, I think you're right. It's drink music. They sing and drink a drink to get mad. I've heard. You will know more after tonight. You didn't kill Victorio. When this song changes... watch the windows. You know they don't drink, to get drunk, drinking is a kind of prayer. Then they kill! Tell me about the Indians. Pagans, I know their belief. "A thousand spectra will emerge to replace those who die". This is just an excuse to kill! No. The Lord does not know them. Apaches are an endangered breed. Their women are sterile, there are no children in their tents. And now Victorio, has given them hope. Music to sing, music to dance and belief in killing themselves, will have a hundred children. Children to fight against us. Ghost warriors! The young Apache... drink not to feel pain. Not the pain of an injury. Not even the pain of death. They will come to kill you and die! I better prevent Joe Madden. Joe... The lieutenant said that this is a type of religious ritual. They try to kill themselves... just to call ghost warriors. I've heard. We have to pay attention to the music. When it changes, they will come through the window. I will warn the others. Stay in my place. Right. Joe, I take your place, but I don't want you to take mine. You better forget about it now. Okay, for now! The friend of the army speaks with the language of a liar, are your words like ashes that the wind can carry? I put my hand on the white man's book. I fight for the white man. What is an oath for an Indian? Much more than for most whites. Mrs. Keon... What is happening? What does this song mean, Sam? It will be a long night. When they start it is best to take the children away from the window. Be careful, Sally. You are the last person I want to happen. Except myself. It is true! Calm! And now! Don't shoot! We can't see anything! Keep children away from candles. But we have to light this place up well. How to fight and hold, a candle at the same time? And if women hold on, the candles. I get one. I don't want to hold a candle! Give me a gun. You light up the place. Here! One for Mrs. His man worked well, like other beasts the Indian sees in the dark. He can't see in the dark as much as you can. He used his head, he's smart. Good job! To my friend. I'm thirsty. I'm very thirsty! You will have to be patient. Hold on. When dawn comes, there will be water! I can't take it... I'm very thirsty. Do you cry like a kitten, do you want milk? My mule gives you milk. We can handle them boys, our troops will arrive in the morning. It's only a few more hours. What the hell, these drums! Have faith man! If you don't like their noise, why not make yours? That's right! You are Reverend Wales. The Gauls have a song for every occasion. I have no voice to sing alone. We'll all sing, set the tone. Come on, sing a war song! There goes the city of Spanish Boot. Only the houses! Sally, I've been thinking about Sam, Sam and me... He's been doing really well here. In a place like this he is of great help. Sometimes it's easier to be brave than honest, Joe. I was wrong when I accused him. I will amend this. I know that you are good. I hope Sam sees this too. Do not shot! Do not shot! Do not shot! Let him speak! There is a medix there to treat boys What did he say? He wanted to know if there are any doctors here. I wish there was! Pedro Peter! Ask him, why do you want a doctor. What do you want, a doctor for? Why Vitorio is coming... But if the doctor heals you, all the Mascaleros will be gone. He said Victorio is hurt. If you have a doctor to cure you, they will leave us alone. It would be great if we had! Wait a minute? Can we believe them? We can. Tell the doctor, do you want to know if Victorio dies? If Vitorio dies... you all will die too! They will kill us all. Isn't that what they want? When they want to attack us in force, they won't have a chance. If Victorio lived until dawn, the troops would arrive, we would be saved. A smart guy could make them believe he is a doctor. In fact thinking about it, I always wanted to be a doctor! You can't help Victorio! I didn't say I could, but... I can handle injuries. He knows how to take care of horses! There is not much difference between a horse and a man. At least I know how to get started, and you wouldn't even know that. You are the mayor, you need it here! I appoint you my Assistant. Tell Apache I'm going to get my black bag. Our doctor, Vitorio will run! Maybe you can use that with your other hand. You are my Assistant. Do a good job. I would rather be Victorio's nurse. Perhaps you are a better doctor. But I am better off! Joe, good luck! Yea Joe, you must be giving that Indian, a lot of treatment. When do you think Colonel Haven and the troops will arrive? Maybe eight, or nine hours. If Victorio dies, there is nothing we can do. Nothing they are very angry! They will try. When they attack the door, it will be the end. You can break it or burn it, then it will be over. I hope Joe has shown himself to be a good doctor! Or the Indian is a good horse! Himself! Himself! Do not open! Do not open the door! Close the door. If you live to bury, Joe Maden. I will say only four words in your grave. "This was a man!" Does that mean that Victorio died? Is. We're lost, aren't we? You never know, the next card. I think you already know. Have you warned others? I don't know what to say, how to say it and I don't know if I should. And if Sam didn't know, what would he like to know? The truth. They also. Reverend! We have no chance. It is better to prepare the staff. I know! See the door! Back. We'll shoot when they get in! We can push them away! Get some wood! Keep the door burning! C'mon C'mon! We need more. We will! Take the seats! We need more wood! More wood! Put more wood! Back! Everyone back! Let's get the floor off. "THE END"
