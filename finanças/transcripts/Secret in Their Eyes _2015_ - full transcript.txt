You're good. Thank you, sir. Is that you, angel? Yeah, it's me. What brought you back this way? I just... l couldn't stay away from you. Oh, stop. Go on. I'm gonna see them upstairs. Ray Kasten. She's expecting me. Go right ahead. Look who's back. Could you ask Jessica Cobb to come in, please? Mmm-hmm. Like a rash. Wow. Thirteen years. Two promotions. Still an asshole. Three promotions. Thanks for keeping track. What can I say? I'm a fan. You mind? Good luck. Am I late? Just a bit. It's good to see you, Ray. Well, it's... Well, I see the filing system hasn't changed much. The wheels of justice turn slowly, but they do turn. And look at you. Up on the fifth floor. We will do whatever is necessary to protect America. But make no mistake, the resolve of our great nation is being... Fax went down again. Hello, Al Fawid. Now be a good little terrorist and just hand over some yellow-cake uranium in broad daylight, and we're all set. Amen. Erectile Dysfunction Hotline. How can I direct your call? Not at all. Have a good day. Attaboy, Bumpy. Give 'em hell. You really are a moron, Bumpy, you know that? Siefert, you keep throwing that term around, but I'm not sure you know what it actually means. It's a medical term. Did you know that? Is that right? - Mmm-hmm. It means someone with an lQ between 50 and 69. An imbecile's someone with an lQ between 49 and 20. And an idiot, I think is the word you're looking for. Someone who scores below 19. Hmm. What do you call someone who's dumber than that? Lieutenant. Where you going? I'm wanted at Photo. Chin up. Shoulders back. Pakistani Taliban are increasingly upping their fight to cross the border. This is one of their recent propaganda videos shot in Afghanistan. In a barbaric act, they murder a man they claim is an Afghan spy working for NATO. Channel 4 cannot confirm... Hi. Hello. Um, I'm Ray. Ray Kasten. Claire. Claire Sloane. Okay. It's nice to meet you. Yes. Nice to meet you. I guess we're the, uh, new kids at school. Yup. Today is picture day. Yeah. That must be why I suddenly feel like my mom picked out my outfit. Oh. Have a great day. Thanks. You're Bureau? - Yeah. Field office, Lower Manhattan. I was transferred here to sit on a mosque with the D.A.'s office. You? I just got to the D.A.'s office, from Philly. I'm second chair of the Homicide Unit. Well, that's a pretty stiff rank to come in with. You must be a star. No. Hardly. Is this a temporary assignment for you? Um, I don't know. I guess that kind of depends on the guys in the mosque. Counselor? Oh. Yeah. Thank you. Well, it's nice to meet you. Yes. Claire. Yeah? Yes. I'm Ray. I said that. Okay. Mmm-hmm. Kasten. Ray Kasten. Ray Kasten, yeah. FBI. Have a seat. Thank you. Give me one second. I just wanna adjust the light. Yeah. A picture's forever, right? Ray Kasten. How are you liking Los Angeles? I'm still just finding my way around. Okay now, your right collar, please? Good. Smile. District Attorney. My goodness. It's lawyering. Same as before, only more of it. You wanna sit down? And from here, where? Mayor? No. No more campaigns for a while. I'm here, I'm happy. Oh, you thinking of governor already? Wow! Well, I wanted to be head of security for the Mets, but the position was already filled. And, um, how's Ellis? Fine. Yeah. The same, busy. Any kids? Kids? No. No. Never the right time. What about you? Oh, no. Same. Mind if I close the door? Ray? Jess. Jesus! How are you? How are you? I'm good. I'm good. You? Oh, I'm... I'm fine. I was just congratulating Claire. Well, you made Chief lnvestigator, right? So I'm... I'm looking at royalty here. You still living in Moorpark? Yes. It's quiet out there. I like the quiet. You still Bureau? No. No, I went private sector. Badge kind of lost its charm for me. I'll let you two... No, no, no. Stay. Please. This is about you. I found him, Jess. I found Marzin. All right. Here you go. Thank you. Psst! You could just ask her out, you know? Who said I wanna ask her out? Christ. An unrequited office romance. The cliché of it doesn't bother you? Jess. Have a little respect. She's engaged. You know? This is... it's inappropriate. The beauty from Harvard Law and the blue-collar Fed from the wrong side of Brooklyn. So sad. Don't be a dick, Jess. Thank you, Ray. A sexist would've called me something else. Why? You're such a dick. Up. Let's go. Where's the fire? LAPD just found an unidentified female body in a garage dumpster. So, what's that got to do with us? Garage is next door to our mosque, Al-Ankara. This is not good. Mosque turning into a crime scene. Al Fawid's gonna shut everything down and go to ground. Think positive, Ray. Maybe Al Fawid did the murder. We could arrest him without him having to blow something up first. I'll talk to my snitch. He knows everything going on in that mosque. Ugh! Siefert, when are you gonna cough that guy's name up already? My curiosity is killing me. Sorry, Cobb. Golden rule of counter-terrorism, remember? Protect the snitch. Four months after the events of 9/11, L.A.'s high rises and hospitals remain unprepared to respond to a terrorist attack, according to a study released today by the RAND Corporation. One of the biggest concerns, communication between... lntelligence officials are increasingly concerned about the level of chatter they're picking up. Senior Administration members telling us this could mean terror cells in the U.S. are about to become operational. ...terrorists may be planning another attack on a major U.S. city. The Department of Homeland Security raised the terror threat level to "red" today in response to what's being called, quote, "Credible intelligence of an impending domestic attack." Whoa! D.A. l.'s at a crime scene. Things a little slow today, guys? No subpoenas to serve? You really are an idiot, Fierro. Medically. Impressive, huh? He was Homicide before he joined the Bureau. Be the ball, Ray. No purse, no lD. Body appears to have been bleached inside and out. Take notes, fellas. This is evidence collection. Custodian reports seeing a young man, possibly Arab, leaving the scene about 10:30, carrying his belongings. Looked to be homeless. Was he running or walking? Didn't say. You mean, you didn't ask. I didn't do the interview. Just 'cause they're Muslims doesn't mean they're all terrorists. Wouldn't wanna stereotype anybody, would we? No, of course not. Give her some room. They don't even spell things right in here. He's got a theory. Jess... it's... What is it? It's Carolyn. What? It's... it's Carolyn. It's your daughter. No! No! Jess, Jess, Jess! Not my girl... No! No! No! Help me! Help me! Oh, my God! Oh, my sweet girl! It's my baby! Where is he? He's on parole. Just did 10 years. Tracy, armed robbery. Under the name Clay Beckwith. How did you, uh, find him? Lnmate photos hacked online. 696,000 Caucasian males in the U.S. prison system. You can cycle through the entire population in a year if you look at 1,906 faces every night, so that's what I did. For a year? For 13 years. Started the day I left here. Yeah. The nose is different, and the eyes. You know, must've had surgery. Makes sense, given what he did, and contact lenses. But the ages synch up. Beckwith's 33, Marzin 20 when we lost him. What do you want? Reopen it. I'm without portfolio now. I can't exactly contact the guy's P.O. Jess? Surveillance video shows a gray van entering this garage at 10:27, leaving 20 minutes later. Same van was reported stolen three days ago. She have any errands in the neighborhood, or appointments? I don't know. Where are we? We're at the mosque. Oh. Did she take her car? She didn't tell me what she was doing this morning, because she always told me about her morning at lunchtime. Jess? I thought if I ever found him it would just be me and him in an alley. This is... I don't think I have the stomach to watch him walk away again. This is Claire's shop now. Nobody torches it this time. Right. Easy. Except the police would have to run point, and we never did have an actual case against him. Well, maybe he confesses. Would you? Maybe we could go about this a little less officially. I could call the parole officer... No, no, no. If we did this, you couldn't be involved. You know that. They're here. Yeah. Thank you. Should I tell them you'll be late? I'll be along in a minute, yeah. Good to see you, Ray. Hey, Jess... You can, um, leave it open. So, this is how you waltz back in here? I know. Look at him. Same guy. We've had about 20 Marzin sightings since you left. All of them have been false alarms, and Jess dies a little bit every time. Claire, look at him. You'd just be reopening a case. For review. Under the radar. That's all we'd be doing. Yeah, let's pretend that that's all we'd be doing. Claire, I have to... l have to leave. I have to leave in two weeks. I gotta be back after the first. Please, help me do this. It's everything. Um, if you leave your number at the desk, I'll call you later. Okay. You know, you always did belong here. So did you. Kasten, call your office. It's urgent. Someone stole second base. It's December, shithead. I finished her room. It's all packed. Where will you go? Someplace quiet. Outside the city. Just not here. Homicide hasn't found anything yet, have they? They will. What are we hearing from the mosque? A lot of praying. Not much else. Did you find his van? No. We found her car. Where? Outside a bakery. Was it broken into? No. It's just... We're talking about... it just feels impossible. We're talking about Carolyn. Um... There's a lot of... ...stuff in the garage to pack. She made some beautiful things, didn't she? Yeah. Yeah, she did. Who's this? You ever see him before that day? I don't remember seeing him on that day. This is the office picnic, right? Yeah. She ever mention him to you? Why would she? Mind if I take this? Sure. Why? I've seen this guy before. Hey, Bumpy. Hey. Somebody here needs some help. I always knew you'd be back. Great to see you, Bump. You, too. Nothing like Christmas in Los Angeles, huh? Sleighs, snow-covered streets. Are you up for a little field work? Ray needs a few doors opened. Which ones? Old ones. Guess I always knew he'd be back, too. I'm not sure how much use I'll be. I've been an indoor pet for a while now. I'll take my chances. We ask anybody else, red flags will go up. Well, that's flattering. Okay. This time it sticks, right? Thanks, Bumpy. That never got better? What? Your limp. What limp? - Hey, Bump. - Yeah. Who's this guy? Who, the guy in blue? Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is the office picnic, right? Yeah. Okay. Who's that? I don't know. What, you didn't see him there? Yeah, I saw him, but I don't know who he is. Hey, who's this guy? No idea. Dave. - Yeah. Who's this guy? You're standing right by him. Who is he? Sorry. He's standing right by you. I don't know him. Rupert. This guy. You know him? Mmm-mmm. No. Hey, Siefert! Siefert, office picnic, this guy, he's staring at Carolyn Cobb, who is he? What, are you working Homicide now? You know the guy or not? No. Okay. Okay, so a guy shows up at the office picnic, except nobody saw him, half of you were there! Nobody knows who he is. Is that right? This guy. No? No. Okay. Let's do it this way. I've seen this guy before, Bump. Hey. Hey. Can I give you some... Just unsolicited advice, one cop to another? You're kind of crossing a line here. You're using C-T software on a rape-murder case. Things like that get noticed. So I should what, ignore the lead? No, you give the lead to the guys that are actually investigating the case over at Homicide. Come on, you were brought here to fight terrorism. Well, her body was found next to the hottest mosque in L.A. What makes you think I'm not fighting terrorism? I'm just trying to spare you an ass-kicking. Why don't you spare yourself? Okay? Spare myself. Right. God damn it, I knew I'd seen that guy before! He's from the mosque! God, I hope you're wrong about this. The idea that it could've been someone connected to this office? I don't think I could live with that. Who's the lead on this at LAPD? Um, a detective named Guerrero. Has he seen these? No. No, I thought it might reflect badly on the office, the guy being at the picnic, so... I wanted to show them to you first. Thank you. I appreciate it. All right. Leave all this with me, get back to your C-T work. I'll get this Guerrero up to speed. No, I can take care of that. No, no. Nothing should ever come before your terrorism cases. Ever. Well, it's not a problem for me, sir, to put out a field report. No, I can explain things to him, you know? One vato to another. Well, the thing is, sir, because it's Jess, I wanna bird-dog this one. They teach you some version of "Yes, sir" at the Bureau, don't they? Yes, sir. So? Be careful in there. He's slick. And unless I'm very wrong, he's about to ask you to lunch. Mean a lot to me if you said no. How's Jess? Did you find anything yet? I did. Aban Ghazala, the guy seen running from the garage. He'd been living down there. Just confessed. Where is he? County. Well, well, well. Our new star. Come on in, Claire. Say, it's almost lunch time. Are you hungry? Hey. I wasn't here today, okay? We're trying to assess him as a C-T source. We gotta keep it quiet. Understood. Ghazala? You really are a dumb son of a bitch, Siefert! Is that how cases get buried 'round here? You find the nearest Muslim and you ring him up! You're protecting someone, Siefert, and you're gonna tell me who it is! Who are you protecting? Just let me up! Let me up, will ya? Come on. Jesus God. I was just trying to point you away from someone. That guy in that stupid picture of yours? I can't have you questioning him at the moment. Why is that? Who is he? My snitch. Huh? My guy in the Al-Ankara mosque. The guy staring at Carolyn Cobb is your snitch? I don't think he's your doer, Kasten. Well, why don't you introduce us? I'll ask him. 'Cause he is this close to giving us a whole sleeper cell! You don't spook a guy like that! What the hell you bring him to the picnic for? He's a wanna-be, all right? The guy's got some fantasy of being a cop someday! So I brought him to the picnic, I let him feel like a big-shot. Anything to keep him happy. Well, it worked. He found his true love there! You don't... You don't know that. I do know that you tricked a phony confession out of a guy who didn't do it! I do know that! My guy shuts down, everybody loses! A couple more buildings come down maybe. So I redirected things a bit. Sorry. He got a name? You want me to send Jess in here to ask you? Anzor Marzin. Street name's Pac-Man. Where is he? Where is he? Hey, I don't know, okay? Maybe you can find him. Okay. When's the last time you seen him? Ten days. Carolyn Cobb was killed 10 days ago. Was that a coincidence? Detective on the case, Guerrero, he know about all this? Of course he does. Guy understands the ugly truth. Meaning what? Meaning, someone hands us good names, his love life doesn't matter. Jesus Christ! All right. All right, start writing. Address. His address, his girlfriend's address, something useful. Couldn't just let it go, huh? - Stripper, huh? - Mmm-hmm. Well, that is exciting. But she's not coming out. She's coming out. Yeah, right. And then Marzin's gonna pull up in a stolen gray van with Carolyn's DNA under his nails, and everybody wins. You can forget about the van. We're not gonna find it. You know what I like about you, Ray? We're not even pretending to do this right. Meet the detective who's actually in charge? Screw that. We're not just crossing the line, we're burying it. I don't need to know Guerrero to know Guerrero. I've seen guys eat a case before. I'm gonna go water that bush over there, okay? Swimming pools and movie stars. Come on, Moose. Nice stealth. Yeah, well... if you had evidence on this asshole, we could warrant him, like professionals. Hey, Bump, get the door, will ya? All right, check upstairs. I'll watch the door. Did you find anything? Jesus! Shit! You scared the hell out of me! I scared you? What the hell you sneaking up on me for! Sorry. Did I wake you? There's nothing upstairs. Anything down here? I don't know. Maybe. Wow, this guy can really draw. Shit! What are you bitching about? I gave you a cookie. Go, go, go, go. Get up there! Get up there! I'm trying! Move that trash can! Move! Damn it! Ouch! That is a bad bite. He looked rabid to me. You're probably gonna die. We need to get back in there. Why? See how the comic book turns out? Yeah, obviously. Yeah, I guess that would be huge. Epic. Probably a lot of clues in there. You didn't take it, Bump. The pork rinds look pretty good. No, you couldn't have taken it. Nobody would be that stupid. Yeah, well, how about a Twinkie? You hungry? You want a Twinkie? Bump? Oh. Happy birthday! Dipshit. What? She's not gonna miss it. She tells him someone was there, he never comes back. Hey, what's your brilliant idea, we just leave it there on the bed with the drawer open? At least now we have it! Do me a favor, okay? Let me run point on this. I'll put an extra dollar in your paycheck, I swear to God! Suit yourself. All right, let me have it. I thought you didn't want it. Bump, give me... Bumpy, give me the... Give me the... Well, looks like you won another convert. P.O. took one look at those pictures, said, "Yep, same guy." What else he say? Said he knows him as Beckwith. Never heard him called Marzin or Pac-Man or anything else. Uh, Beckwith checked in two weeks after release, then skipped two weeks ago. I asked if he had any hobbies, you know, like drawing, or if he ever talked about baseball. No and no. But he does seem to like horses. The racing kind. Talks about them all the time in an unhealthy kind of way, according to the P.O. He has sort of a, uh, fixation. Uh, said, "if I had the time to do it, "I'd look for him at the track. "Horses might be the only thing he likes "as much as stealing cars." Hey. Your table, as I recall. He skipped parole, didn't he? Your Beckwith. Wasn't much of a surprise. Why? And the P.O. doesn't recall Beckwith having a particular talent for drawing, does he? His name's Marzin. Not Beckwith. Is this why you called me here? Just trying to gauge the value of your leads. Thank you. But they're my leads. And she was my kid. Jess, it's not gonna be like last time. We find the guy, he goes down. You shouldn't make promises like that. I can make that promise. You know, everybody's asking me, since you're back, "Who is this guy?" "What is it with his obsession with your daughter?" And I say, "Well, he's a friend. He's a badge." They say, "Yeah? Then where's he been the last 13 years?" I was supposed to meet Carolyn in that bakery. The day she... She was gonna have a party for your birthday. I told her I'd meet her there and pay for the cake. Last minute, I begged off, after she'd already gotten there. I had... I had some case work to file. Two hours later, we found her. That's where I've been the last 13 years. What happened to Siefert's face? Hell if I know. I was hoping for a better answer than that. Well, I don't spend that much time thinking about Siefert's face. Assaulting an officer? Where the hell were you and Bumpy yesterday? You do that in court, you spin your chain like that? I do it when I'm anxious. You're making me anxious. Oh, yeah? Why is that? Because I caught the case. Ghazala. Morales put me on it. Of course he did. That son of a bitch! You're being taken, Claire. Ghazala's not your guy. You're gonna have to explain that. There's a snitch. He's working Al-Ankara mosque. His name's Marzin. He's also a person of interest on Carolyn Cobb. And, by the way, everybody's running around, trying to blow this thing up. He's the doer! So Siefert squeezes a phony confession out of Ghazala and the snitch stays untouched, 'cause he's working C-T for us. Now he turns up as the rapist-murderer of a cop's kid? No. No, can't be the guy. Morales has assured me that this case has the highest priority. Yeah. And Guantánamo's a Club Med resort. Hey, Jess. What you got there? Oh, it's nothing. It's not for you. It's not what I hear. Sorry. Is he the guy? He's "a" guy. That's all we know. Anything in there indicate a predilection for violence? It's a comic book. They're all violent. Can I see it? Jess, you shouldn't be here. Anything you touch is inadmissible. Can I see it? No. Ray. You have to be honest, that's the only rule. 'Cause she's good at this. Okay. All right. Okay. The truth and nothing but the truth. I'm ready. Fear not. This is beautiful, by the way. Thank you. You're welcome. It's beautiful. Okay. So, are you looking for a professional type? Struggling actress type? What? Nurturing schoolteacher type? I'm... I'm willing to cast a wide net, so... Very wise. Very wise. Thank you. Uh, how about tall, short... Other? No preference? There's no preference, as long as she's smart. How smart? Preferably Harvard-educated. Oh, okay. From Philly. Hmm. Who's a prosecutor. I see. Named Claire. That might narrow the field a bit, Ray. That's very good. Very good. What can I say? What can you say? You look a little quiet all of a sudden. Claire. I think you should know that I can't rein her in. She's not gonna stop till she finds this guy. You never saw Jess and her kid. They were inseparable. Yeah. I can imagine. I know it's messy. I mean, working C-T, but we gotta find this guy before Jess does, okay? I'll work it at night, under the radar. Morales doesn't have to know. I can't tell you what to do with your free time. But my legal advice would be, find that van. Thank you. 'Night. Uh, let me, uh... Let me walk you to your car. Oh, you don't have to do that. No, no, I'd like to, if you don't mind. Something about garages lately. So, when's the big day? Hmm? Oh. Um... Sometime next year. Congratulations. Oh. What's he do? He manages a hedge fund in Philly. His name is Ellis. So, what, is he moving here? That's the plan. Is that a hard thing to do, to manage a hedge fund in Philly when you're living in L.A.? Might be. But he's pretty clever. I bet he is. Ellis is a pretty clever name. And love conquers all, right? That's me. See you tomorrow. Jess is lucky to have you, Ray. You're a good friend. She'd do the same for me. She'd do more. Yeah, this guy could be anywhere. All right, I wanna see the stables. What the hell for? That's where the horses are. You're my beautiful, baby boy. Ain't you? Look at you... Bump. I'll be damned. You like that? You like that, don't you? Hey. Hey, buddy. Nice work on the face, Pac-Man. I like it. And you are? You don't remember me? Let's talk. Call it in! Ray. Where did he get you? I had him, Bump. That was Marzin. It's okay. This is Luis. He says the guy is here all the time boosting cars. Guy got a name? I... I don't talk to him. I don't like the way he looks at the horses. You got a cell phone, Luis? Give it to me. If the guy comes here again, text "911" to this number, and I'll be here. Bump, will ya? Yeah. Got it. It was him all right. Oh, yeah. Son of a bitch. Thanks, Luis. Hi. Um, I was waiting for... I'm sorry. Oh, no, it's fine. Ls there anything... Well, I was just gonna see if you wanted, you know, walk you to your car again. Oh. I wasn't ready to leave yet. Neither was l. Something making you nervous? Oh, this. It's a... it's a silly habit. It's just kind of endearing, if you ask me. Then it's yours. Well, you need it more than I do anyway. Is that right? Mmm-hmm. You sure you can live without it? I know how you heady-types tend to obsess. That's right, obsessing is awful. I hope it never happens to you. Let me, uh... l... I... I like the one on page 90, by the way. I mean, I don't know, but I think you... You'd break... Break hearts in that dress. That's sweet. Yeah, really sweet, Ray. Come with me. Uh, would you excuse us, Claire? Thank you. Please tell me I've been misinformed. Please tell me no one from this office broke into the home of a stripper to steal a comic book in some half-assed attempt at making a case against a prime C-T asset! There's a case to be made, sir. With a picture from a picnic as evidence. And no participation from the actual cop investigating the case. This how you do things in New York? Hmm? No warrant. You just surveil whomever you wish! My sense was that your enthusiasm for the target was low, sir. I'll tell you what's lower, my enthusiasm for witnessing another 9/11. Jesus Christ. Everybody knows those assholes wanna hit L.A. next! Half the families in my neighborhood are buying duct tape and hazmat suits! You don't even have a case against this guy! You don't have his van, you don't have shit! If I did, would you file? No, I'd let a rapist-murderer go free! Jess is a friend of mine. You'd charge him, politics aside? And while you're doing this, how many C-T leads are going unpursued? How many hurdles are you placing between Marzin and his ultimate use to us, which is intel on that mosque! If I had evidence on him tying him to Carolyn Cobb, you'd charge him? Of course! I have your word on that? Did I just stutter? And by the way, Harvard Law doesn't date community college, so stop hitting on my new hire. You're embarrassing yourself. You were always beautiful, but so ambitious. I prefer "determined." Political. Collegial. Oblivious. I think you like looking back more than I do. I don't have the time for it. Okay. Let's look forward. Okay, let's. I think you should go back to New York. Why? Because I don't like where this is going, and I can't justify it for a case that isn't there. Oh, it's there. I got two broken ribs from a shovel says it's there. That was Marzin. I need two more men. What? Bumpy's on one leg and truth is I don't move like I used to. Come on, Ray, you move exactly like you used to. They don't have to be big men. Get out. I mean it. Go home. I can't. 9/11 was just the beginning. Protect your home, please. Protect your family. Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, they have anthrax now... Bump. What is it? You said you had a lead on Marzin. We do. We? Come here. Hey, Jess. I hate the death penalty. Oh, yeah? Why's that? Death would be too good for this guy. A big meal and a shot and a nap. Let him rot in jail, live a life full of nothing. Uh-huh. What're we doing here, guys? Waiting for him. He's been here? He will be. Bumpy and I figured it out. Jess, you come within a mile of this guy, we never make a case. He can quit his job, he can change his name, he can dump his car, but I will still find him, 'cause there's one thing you can't change, and it's right here. Are you drunk? The Justifier by Pac-Man Marzin. Page one, first character, a monster hunter named Alston Sherry. Bumpy? Alston. Could that be Walter Alston, the winningest manager in the history of the Dodgers? He won four World Series titles, three of them here in L.A. And Sherry. Larry Sherry? The MVP of the '59 World Series. That's the first championship here in L.A. Not that it matters, but he had two wins and two saves in that series. Page two, Alston's partner, named Bulldog O'Malley. Bump? - Walter O'Malley? The owner who brought the Dodgers to L.A. from Brooklyn? Man was a saint. You seeing a pattern here, Ray? How about "Bulldog", huh? Orel "Bulldog" Hershiser? Star of the last Dodger team that won a Series, '88? Before we sucked. So, why are we here, Bumpy? 'Cause this is the place where ex-Dodgers hang out. And all the crazies know it. And by the way, the monster that O'Malley and Sherry are chasing is orange and black. You know, the colors worn by that team up north. Think I'd have noticed that a little sooner. Don't beat yourself up, Bump. Think Blue. See? Passions are like maps. Take me, for example. Carolyn is... Was the thing that made me me. Nothing will ever change that. Take you, the way you keep thinking about Claire. It's a lost cause. But you don't give up. Passion always wins. So I will be here every night from now on. He'll come here. That's kind of a long shot. Crazy. I know. Sort of like building a whole case around a picture from an office picnic. But you look at enough faces, you're bound to find the one you're looking for. Eventually, right? So, when's the next game? This capacity crowd coming to life now as the Dodgers have gotten off the mat. Onlinger checks the runner, rocks and deals way outside. Ball four. And that fast, Manager Dave McDaniels out of the dugout, on his way to the mound. We'll see if he's bringing a hook with him. You know, the 2002 Met bullpen has not been particularly impressive. Yo, buddy, sit down! Sit down! I'm looking for my uncle. Yeah, and I'm trying to watch the game. You know, after 10 nights of this, I've really learned something. Bump. Ten rows up, seven guys in. Yeah. Yeah, maybe. Okay. Excuse me. Sir. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, Marzin! Hey! Hey! Sorry. Down in front! Bump! With me! Delivers... Belted! Out of the way! Marzin! Bump! Check down there! Hey, Kennedy, seal the exits! Roger that! What the hell, bro! Jesus. Move! I got the suspect... Hey! Stop! Marzin, stop! Marzin! God damn it! You okay? Get him! The suspect just... Hey! Hold it right there! Get out of the way! Get off me! You got him? Yeah! Yeah. Stay where you are. Son of a bitch. The Dodgers, nine games back and left for dead just 30 days ago, can see daylight now. Just a half a game back in the West, with a 6-5 lead in the bottom of the 8th. Quite a night. What are you trying to do, get yourself suspended, sent back to New York? We didn't know the guy would run. It was a baseball game. We were just there to ask him a couple of questions, but then he ran! Don't do that to me. Don't talk to me like you talk to Morales. I know what you were there to do. What were we supposed to do, let him go? Yes. We don't have anything on him. I want him released. You don't wanna question him first? No! I want him advised of his rights and released before Morales... Morales will file if I can make a case. And Marzin already knows his rights. He's here voluntarily. He'll confess! I just gotta... l gotta work him a little. Meaning waterboarding? No, meaning conversation. Five minutes. If you don't think he's the doer, he walks! Claire. Claire, come on, we can't just let him go. What are you doing? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm begging you. I just wanna remind you that you're here of your own volition. You're free to go at any time. Volition. That's a great word. I think I'm gonna use it someday, when I'm a cop. You understand your rights. Yeah. Is this about the mosque? No. This is about Carolyn Cobb. Who? Carolyn Cobb. Mmm. I never met her. I don't remember this picture. Where is this? It's the office picnic. You were the guest of Reggie Siefert, your, uh... Your rabbi in here. Your godfather. Oh, yeah, yeah. I came to the picnic for 10 minute maybe. Music was shit. That... Is that a Glock 9? That's standard issue, right? Why did you run from us? You serious? I'm ratting on the sickest sleeper cell in L.A. I get spotted chatting with two cops, I'm a dead man. Wait... Are you the guys who took my comic book? Yeah, fuckhead. I'm the guy that took your comic book. Carolyn Cobb. I think you raped her and killed her, Pac-Man. Hmm. Yeah, that would be smart, 'cause I don't have enough heat on me as it is, do I? So... I think you met her at the picnic, convinced yourself that she was interested in you, and then maybe after a couple of days following her around, you went up to her, declared your undying love, and when she told you to piss off, you raped her and killed her and dumped her body in the trash, doused in bleach. Mmm. Bleach? Where'd you hide the van? I'm trying to do good. Pretty girl. Okay, you should be thanking me. I'm not even saying I'm blaming you for taking the shot. Excuse me. Yeah. You need to walk away. He has a lawyer in the building. He hasn't made any calls. He has friends here, remember? Look, I just need a few more minutes. No, that won't be necessary. Mr. Marzin has been a very good friend to this office. I thought I made that clear to you. May I see the file, please? Hmm. Mr. Marzin. You're free to go. We're sorry if we've inconvenienced you. This is not your doer. How do you know? Read the file. Carolyn Cobb, 5'7", 130 pounds. An athlete. "The damage to the right parietal bone "and left mandible of the victim "indicated that the attacker "was of extraordinary physical strength." You see? We're looking for a brute, not a kid. You can't overpower a girl like that with two noodles for arms. It's laughable. And then, of course, there's the bleach. A clear sign of premeditation. Your killer knew enough to douse the victim thoroughly inside and out so as to destroy all the DNA evidence. Now, that takes smarts, it takes strategic thinking. What is your level of education, Mr. Marzin? What is it, high school? Less than that? We're looking for an intellect. This one likes to sit in his room and draw comic books with monsters, and maybe jack off to the posters on his wall. Which brings me to the final piece of exculpatory evidence. Which means, Mr. Marzin, evidence which proves your innocence of the charge. "Examination of the decedent's vaginal walls "indicate injuries at a depth of nine inches." We're looking for someone with a hammer, not a peanut. You have no idea what he... Oh, women always know. Men carry themselves one way, boys another. Don't they? Don't they, Mr. Marzin? And that right there. Trying to look down my blouse, that's something a boy would do. So you run along, little one. You run along. We're sorry for the mix-up. Peanut. Is that what you said, you cocky bitch? Gosh, how impressive. Am I swooning? Go home, loser. Draw yourself some more monsters. You want some of this, bitch? We're done here. You want what she got? - What? Here's what she got! You don't touch her! You don't touch her! You don't touch her! Son of a... You don't touch her! I'll kill you! You... Ray! Ray! Ray! God damn it! Ray, enough! Ray! Ray! It's okay. Enough! Ray, it's okay! Ray! Ray! It's okay. He said it! You okay? We got him. Lock him up. Oh, God. You okay? You okay? No. You're letting him go, aren't you? You think I'm stupid, sir? That's two questions. Which one do you want me to answer first? Hello, Claire. You and I had an understanding! Yes, that you would bring me a case. But you don't have one. Just this half-assed confession from Marzin who claims it was beaten out of him. And he's got the injuries to prove it! He attacked Claire! So, what do you want me to do? Trade a whole mosque full of potential arrests for a comic book and a picture from a picnic? Put me in the goddamn mosque! I'll get you more names than he will! If that'll get you out of my office. You looked me right in the eye, you told me you'd prosecute him. And I also told you nothing comes before our efforts in counter-terrorism! Nothing! Now, you drop this right now, or I'm sending you back to the Bureau! You understand me? That boy is officially untouchable! Untouchable? He's guilty. Welcome to the war. There's a time to shut up, Claire, and there's a time to tell your boss the truth. And when he's being a horse's ass, that's when you tell him the truth! Yeah, well, you really turned him around in there. I mean, you just knocked him flat. But it's your case! We don't have a case! You wanna tell Jess that, or should I? Son of a bitch! Ray. Ray. Come on. Come on. Cover your ears. What? You don't wanna hear this. Let's kill him. Let's do it now, before we lose him again. We just do it and that's it, he goes. Nobody will miss him. We'll make the case on the mosque without him, and Carolyn gets to rest. And then what? What would a few bullets get me? A lifetime in jail. So he dies without ever serving a day, and I spend the next 50 years envying him. Does that sound like justice to you? You're both working for a liar. That's the trouble with you, Ray. You think that matters. So, then... Would 26 be too old? Yes. Who's the guy? Would 25? Who's the guy? He's a student like me. How old is this... Twenty-one. Lsh. That's clever. You start me at 26, so that 21, which is really 22, sounds reasonable. I admire that. Thank you. But I'm still not gonna say yes. Mom. What? He already asked me out! But it would mean missing your office picnic. This just gets worse and worse. I want you to be there! I only have three more months with you, and then you're 2,000 miles away, and it's dorm life and frat parties, and I'll seem boring by comparison. Come, please. Come. I think I have to quit. You wanna bet on whether I get called back to New York tomorrow. Claire. Yeah? If I am... A van's just been found wrecked on Grand Street. Driver fled. Lnside smells like bleach. He tried to move it. He tried to move it! Give me the keys! I'll drive! We find anything in there that lD's Marzin, we might actually have him. Maybe you won't have to go. Oh... Welcome to the war. You think Morales did this? Of course he did. He had to. Ray. Claire, I'm sorry. I don't know, I've been with the Mets 10 years now, and it's the same thing every season, our pitching's weak. You know, our best guy went down with an elbow injury. They had this great kid coming up, but he, uh... Well, they decided to trade him for a left fielder, so... Well, that's the thing about trades, huh? Everybody has to give up something. Well, I can tell you where we are with Marzin, if you want. Tell me why you're not married anymore. Why don't you tell me why you still are? Ellis and I understand each other. You? Well, she was... She was great, actually. She was kind of a saint. There was just one thing about her that neither one of us could fix. What was that? She wasn't you. Well, you always were a little slow. Oh, yeah? Mmm-hmm. How's that? Why didn't you ask me to come with you? And give up second chair? No, not you. Like I said, slow. What is that? No, it's just the... Just the office. Back home. Baseball emergency? Yeah, they, uh... They put in this new surveillance system. It's giving everybody fits. I gotta get to the laptop in the hotel. You're really not gonna tell me where you're going? You know what? Truth is it's probably better I didn't ask you to come with me. This way, I got to spend the next 13 years pretending that you might've actually said yes. And I did. Good night. Would you be careful? Be careful, okay? There. The Mercedes. Where the hell are you? I got him, Bump. He's in a Benz. We're heading over the Fourth Street Bridge. He made you yet? No. But it looks like he's gonna take a right on Anderson. Okay. I'm on my way. Under the radar, right? What, I'm gonna start respecting protocol now? Break my perfect record? Let me look around and see who I can scare up. Okay, brick building, corner of Anderson and Mateo. I'm betting it's a chop-shop. And don't do anything till I get there. You wind up dead, I get a demerit. Hey, yo! Let's get it in! Ain't no thing! Are you kidding me? Ain't no thing, dog! Hey. Asshole. Why you following me? He's a cop. He's gotta be a cop. Mmm. No badge. He's in a rented car. Why is he following you then? Nice. I said, why are you following me, man? Pac-Man, you still don't remember me? I'm Pac-Man. I'm in a video game. Who the hell is Pac-Man? You have to answer for Carolyn Cobb. You have to answer... Yo, can we lose this guy already? Yeah, get rid of him. Do it. Come on. Come on. I know who you are... I know. Freeze! Freeze! Raise your hands! Hands up! Nobody do anything stupid! Let me see your hands! Get on the ground! Put it on the ground! Drop it! Get down! Get down! Drop the gun now. Drop it! Put it on the ground. That's it. Slide it over here. - Bump, you got him? - Yeah. Reggie! Reg, talk to me! Reggie! Don't move! Reggie, talk to me! I got it, Bump. I got it. Come here, buddy. Reggie. Reggie. Stay with me, buddy, come on. Eyes on me, buddy. Reggie. Reggie. Come on, buddy. Eyes on me, buddy. Shots fired. I have an officer down. We are at 516 Anderson Street in a warehouse. I repeat, officer down. Jess. Copy that. Officer down, 516 Anderson Street. Look. It's him. It's Marzin. You see? God damn it! How's he doing, Bumpy? He's dead. I told you I'd get him. Congratulations. You don't think he's Marzin? No, I don't think he's Marzin. I think we just sent a 15-year guy home in a box for five grand theft autos and a parole violation. You saw his face? Up close? Yes. I saw it. Yes. Did you look at Siefert's face? 'Cause he's dead! Well, he had to answer for Carolyn, too. Don't you ever, ever say her name again! So, what now? You fly home? It's done? I don't know. Part of it maybe. I know I should forget it. It was another lifetime. Except it wasn't. We blew it, didn't we? Didn't we? Sure, move him in. He's been living here for the last 12 years anyway. I'm going to bed. Told you he understood me. Jess? Would you like any coffee or... No. No. Have a seat, please. My guys are doing a widows-and-orphans for Siefert. Might not be a bad idea for you to contribute. Yeah. Of course. I forgot he was married. Divorced. Two kids in high school. Well, that's on me. No, it's on me. I could've stopped all this. That's... That's why you're here. I want to thank you both for staying with this like you have, but it has to stop now before anybody else gets hurt. I couldn't live with that. Jess, this is the guy, this is Marzin. He's not the guy. I know you don't wanna get invested all over again. It's not Marzin. I know it. How? 'Cause Marzin's been dead for 13 years. I killed him. What? I killed him about a month after you left. He's buried out in the yard. You understand you're speaking to an officer of the court? I do. Jess... Before you say another word, you need to get yourself a lawyer. It's okay. I'll be fine with whatever you decide to do about it, okay? I would've left him alone, I want you to know that. But when they torched that van... I knew, if Morales could do that, he would never let us bring this guy in. He just... it had to be me. I owed my daughter that. Truth is, he wasn't that hard to find. Eventually, he did come to that bar, like I always said he would. Passion always wins. Right? It's the weirdest thing, when you're on your way to do something, but you're not sure you're actually gonna go through with it. Like reading a book, only you are the person that you're reading about. And then you... You watch yourself do it. Nobody missed him. You were right about that, Ray. We made our case on Al-Ankara without him. Got our convictions, and everybody walked away happy. So forget about this Beckwith. He's a creep, but he's not our creep. Just let it go, okay? Reliving it, wondering if you could've stopped it, it's no way to live. You're telling me... Sorry. But it's done. Claire, I'm fine with whatever you... I need a second. All right? Give me a second. Jess. Was this better? What do you think? I think you look a million years old. I always thought if this one was over, it would feel like it was over. Maybe it's been over a long time, we just never knew it. I'm gonna go and check on her. What do I say? I don't know. Good night. Just let it go, okay? Reliving it, wondering if you could've stopped it... That's where I've been the last 13 years. ...it's no way to live. Don't you ever, ever say her name again! It's quiet out there. I like the quiet. Carolyn is... Was the thing that made me me. What would a few bullets get me? Maybe we could go about this a little less officially. I owed my daughter that. I don't think I have the stomach to watch him walk away again. Does that sound like justice to you? I hate the death penalty. Let him rot in jail, live a life full of nothing. Please. Can... Can you ask her to talk to me? Life sentence, Ray. For you, too? Ray? Ray!
