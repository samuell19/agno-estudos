(dramatic music) (dark music) - [Narrator] All along, my intention was to expose Swan. Who hides his sick perversions behind his all American good looks and respectability. This scheme works because time's allow it. And money is tight. If only I could make the skies rain, but my choice is simple. I'll never let up till this bastard is destroyed. - What the hell is a matter with you guys? Come guys, move it, we don't have all night for this shit, let's go!

You know, my parent's were poor and I wanted to share some of my secrets with the poor folk. - Well the poor folk could hardly afford the 299 dollar price tag for your book. - Actually Rusty, we think that's cheap. Remember, not only do you get a book but you get eight cassette tapes and the secrets of my success. - Speaking of secrets, Mr. Swan, the farmer's in the northern part of the valley are suffering because you're not releasing any of your irrigation water from the dam. - Come on, Rusty, you're not gonna blame me for the drought, are you? You know I run a bottled water company. There's where the water from that lake goes. If I give all that water to the farmers, what am I gonna put in my bottles? I'll be out of business. - But the rumor is that there's some sort of laundering scheme going on as well, is that true? - You don't need to ask me questions like that, huh? - Mr. Swan. - I'm a business man. - All I'm looking for. - I'm not some kind of mobster or something. - Just what we all wanna know is the truth, the truth. - Hey, look, your interview is over. - Mr. Swan, Mr. Swan. Mr. Swan, one more question. One more question. (dramatic music) - Bitch. - Wait, he took the tapes. Son of a bitch, he's such a crook. - They called. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well we leave tomorrow. Well come on, let's see it. (snorting) Nothin' should screw up this deal. You know what I need, Steve? I need my own TV show. I don't need them. Yeah, somethin' fresh. And new. Somethin' with mass appeal. (laughing) Yeah, honest simple people who come forward on their own to tell everybody that my ideas work. (laughing) Listen, Steve, you can't put a price on hope. And that's what I'm gonna be sellin'. The American dream. (laughing) Oh baby. Steve, close the door on your way out, would you? (soft music) Baby, daddy needs you. (moaning) (sexy music) Daddy is going to make you very, very happy. Yeah. - Daddy's always nice to me. (moaning) - And a scoop of vanilla and a scoop of chocolate and a scoop of. (laughing) - You can have as much as your little heart desires, sweetheart. Grandpa's treat. - I thought Mr. Bailey sold this place and was moving. - His brother Tom is, he even tried to hold out against the stack of bills and IOUs taller than he is. (screaming) Good god almighty, what the hell was that, son of a, are you okay? - What was that? - I'm damn well gonna find out. You son of a bitch! - Who was it? - Couldn't tell. (dramatic music) - Oh my god. - Sweet Jesus, Thomas. (dramatic music) (exploding) - Not only being professionally unemployed, also my look was probably enough of the reason why the DEA boys avoided me. But then it was hard to believe that a small town could be used as a shield for another fortress. Yeah, real hard to believe. (mumbling) I know what you're thinkin'. I got something here that your organization's really gonna be pleased about. Look at that. - What are these? - Take a look, look, look. Now ask yourself what kind of activity would a water bottling company be doing in the middle of the night, huh? - Believe it or not, people work all different hours of the day. It keeps them from having too much time on their hands, foolin' around, doing a lot of crazy things. You catch my drift? Hello? - Yeah, I bet you guys are really hilarious at a shoot out, huh? - You should come see us. Hey Waldo, you hungry? (laughing) - I swear, if he bothers me again, I'm gonna lock him up. You eat my sandwich? (kids talking) - Even if you're right, you're only gonna make more trouble by pointing fingers. - Damn it, teach, they killed old man Bailey. Can't you see that they all work for him? - Just cool it for now. We're gonna wait and we're gonna see. - Wait, wait for what, huh? 'Till it's too late? - Look, a reporter friend of mine who works for a big LA newspaper is coming here soon. Look, if we can convince him something's wrong, we could crack this thing wide open. Come on, Darren, we'll wait and see. (soft music) (laughing) - I'll need more than that if you're gonna be gone for a few days. - Yeah? - How 'bout in advance? - I'm gonna have to charge you interest. - I have interest. If you're good, there might be a bonus in it for you. - A bonus? What kind of a bonus? - I have an appointment with Dr. Horner tomorrow. - Dr. Horner? What's wrong? You're pregnant. - I'm not sure. I'm only sure of one thing right now. - What's that? - I'm gonna miss you terribly. (soft music) (rock music) - Hello Bobby, I've been looking for you. - Well lucky you, now you found me. - Are you going to the Depot tonight? - Maybe. - Maybe we'll see you there. (indistinct talking) - All right, bye! (soft music) (people talking) - Get the hell out of here. You push it little brother, you're in the wrong place. - Boy Waldo, you sure are loose with your stuff. - It's hard to hold onto anything when you're around. - Well what do you want? You want this or do you want this? - My groceries and a ride home would be real nice. - Well hell man, you can have all three, hop on. - Give me my groceries. (engine revving) There's Bobby and his booze again. Temporarily heart broken over some girl who exchanged him for Swan. It's a serious problem for a kid his age, isn't it? Or any age. Well, ain't bad such problems only exist until the next relationship. - Hey finish this. - No, booze is not the answer. - Well it might not be the answer but it should does help me forget about the questions. - Why don't you forget about her? Why don't you find somebody that really cares about you, someone that'll stand with you no matter what. - Yeah, why don't you go on? Don't worry about me. Hell, I can't get much drunker anyway. - It's Darren and his frustrations that start to worry me a lot. Getting into mindless situations without any concern about what the outcome will be. That bothers me. (upbeat music) I don't want you doing anymore of these stupid stunts, all right? Should've never let you get involved in the first place. - I'm not gonna let it go. My father's death wasn't an accident. - You want revenge, you want justice. You're not thinkin' straight, kid, you know that. You're gonna get yourself killed. (soft music) - [Darren] Doesn't make a difference. - [Waldo] To me it does, to me it makes a big different. - No damn it. A bunch of fuzzy underexposed photographs that prove nothing and you call that help. - I thought they were pretty good, myself. What did you expect me to do, go around with a flash bulb? The security around the plant is all beef up. Just like this town. Swan's got this whole town locked up. Now if we wanna break his hold on Woodward, we're gonna need some outside help. - You said we were gonna do this by ourselves, just us, we don't need anybody else's help. - Well this situation doesn't call for any dead heroes. (soft rock music) - Ah son of a bitch, you see that? (police sirens blaring) Son of a bitch, he is drunk. Bobby boy, you pull over to the side of the road right now! (rock music) (tires squeaking) You all right? - Is he hurt bad? - He's too damn drunk to be hurt. Get on your feet, Bobby. Get up. Woo wee, damn what have you been doing tonight, Bobby? Bathin' in that stuff? And what the hell are you doin'? - Just following procedure. - Procedures my ass, let's get him in the car. (vomiting) - Jesus, get him in the car. Get him in the car, god damn it. Get in, Bobby! All right boy. Put him in, lock him up. I've gotta go change clothes. (blues music) - Officer, let's hear some logic. You confiscated my rental car, accused me of being, I don't know what, this is totally ridiculous. - Get inside. (soft music) - This is it, you hear me? I have fuckin' had it with you. - Will you please give this asshole his money back? - Good morning, Mr. Lewis. I'm Deputy Warrens and I'm happy to say that you are now a free man. But you have to understand that your rental car fit the description of a stolen vehicle. I wish I could make up for your inconvenience. - Well that won't be necessary. How far is it to the Woodward Hotel? - I'd be glad to give you a lift. This is a friendly town, Mr. Lewis. We do our best to accommodate visitors, especially members of the press. - I'm just here visiting an old friend, Deputy. I'm not particularly interested in writing about your civic hospitality. But I will be glad to take you up on your offer for a ride to the hotel. (soft music) Thank you. - Yeah, I'm at the hotel but Josh hasn't checked in yet. Well, I, I don't know. Josh! Yeah, he just arrived. All right, I'll see you around six for dinner, okay? Bye. Josh, I was worried about you, hey. - Oh man. - You look like hell now, what the hell happened to you? Where you been? - Thanks a lot, I'll explain later pal. You look terrific. - Thanks, it's good to see you, it's been so long. - Yeah, how's the family? - Family's just fine, just fine. You're gonna see 'em tonight, come on. - Wait a minute, shouldn't I check in first? - Bullshit, you're staying with us. - Doug, I need to take a shower. - You can't, we're late, anyway, we don't wanna get Carl anymore pissed than he already is. - Carl, who's Carl? - Our pilot. - Doug, I hate flying, you know that. - Hey, come on, Carl's the best pilot in town. - Well that's great. - At least when he's sober. - Overtime tonight, Carl, overtime tonight. - Full house, queen's over nine's. - You know, if I were you Carl, I'd be the flight for our losses. - So you thinkin' Mitchell Swan is somehow connected to this thing? - Well, unfortunately, small town's like this one aren't immune from drug problems. And Swan's water plant seems to be right in the eye of the storm. - How 'bout when you ran for Mayor here? Does that factor into this in any way? - You know me better than that. - I didn't think so, I didn't think so. But even still, you've gotta have some pretty damning evidence or my editor won't even look at this. And you know, Doug, I can't write it if you haven't got your facts real straight. (honking) Well, looks like I could've taken a shower after all. - Oh yeah, but if you had taken the shower, by the time we had got here, see, the accident would've been history. (laughing) - I think that cops trying to say something to us. - Sorry officer, I couldn't hear ya. - Pull out and follow me so you can get by all this. - Oh great, thanks. I think I'm runnin' for Mayor again. I've given you plenty of opportunities to find some silly excuse not come down here. - Hey I had a real good reason not to come here. - Yeah, do I know her? - Nope. - No, is she young and fruity? - You know something buddy, you haven't changed one iota, not one bit. - I was gettin' worried about you, for a little while, you know, you might've missed the boat. - Thanks a lot. - They're all here boys, you know what to do. - I see 'em, this is it, there they go, holdin' tight on that briefcase. Poor Carl. - Let's blow 'em up. - Yeah, all that bourbon in his system, a human molotov cocktail. (soft dark music) (plane roaring) (soft upbeat music) - The more I practice, the slower I seem to get. Don't think I'm ever gonna get that scholarship. - Gee whiz, what a pity. All this hard work for nothin' then, huh? This is connected with your father's death, isn't it? You hired Waldo to find out who killed your father, didn't you? - I had to do something. - Do what? Pull some dumb ass stunt that's gonna get yourself killed. - Stay out of this, Bobby, okay? Keep your nose in your booze and your brains in your shorts and stay the hell out of the way, all right? - Hey Darren, man, I thought we were friends. - But friends care about what's happening here in Woodward. They care about the people who live here. They don't have the kind of attitude like you. (plane roaring) (exploding) Oh my god. - What? - Oh my god. - What happened? - Oh no. - Darren, what happened? - Oh my god. - Who was up in that plane? - He's gonna pay for this. - Who's gonna pay? - I swear to god, he's gonna pay for this. - Who is gonna pay? Darren, will you stop? (soft eerie music) Darren, stop, stop! Who was it? - Mr. Perkins, the teacher and his reporter friend from Los Angeles. - Come on girls, come on Jens, come on, I don't have all day. - [Girls] No, yes, sure. (indistinct talking) - [Woman] Janice, telephone, it's your doctor. - Hello? Yes, hi Dr. Horner, yes? Ah, yes I'm pregnant! (dramatic music) - Make sure she's comfortable. - Yes sir. - And baby, wait up for me, huh? (dramatic music) - Hi Mr. Swan. Talk to me. Hank, you're bringing far too much attention to our situation here. I mean, leveling farm houses, blowin' planes out of the sky, what the hell is a matter with you? (squealing) I want this kind of behavior stopped. You know, too much is riding on this. Too much depends on our keeping a low profile. - Mr. Swan. Mr. Swan, you know me, I'd never let anything get in the way of. - That's my fuckin' point. You're liable to do anything. You're a loose canon. Unless you learn to control yourself, Hank, you're a serious liability to my operation. What I want is, the people of this community to see me as their friend, their benefactor. Somebody they can come to in their time of need. - Some of the farmer's were talking about water from the lake. - Fuck 'em, not a drop. I'll lend them all the money they want. They can borrow until they're up to their ears in debt. And I'll have 'em right where I want 'em. By their short hairs. (laughing) (dramatic music) Paul, I brought this for ya. (screaming) (laughing) You see, Hank, you gotta know how to handle the things that are bad. They'll come at you. Or they might bite ya. I wanna be alone. You keep the snake company. (dramatic music) (snorting) (dramatic music) (sniffing) (dramatic music) - What's the problem? - Haven't a clue, thing just up and died. - Probably that carburetor again. You got a wrench? - Shame you don't put your hands to more use out here. - I'm trying to be helpful. - You're right, seems like you and me been on opposite sides of fence lately. You know your grandpa raised eight of us here. Off this land. Used to cover some 2000 acres, our farm. Times have sure shrunk that down. - Now before we go any further, I would like to introduce you to our distinguished guest, Mr. Mitchell Swan, chairman of the board, Swan Bottled Water company. (applause) It's a real honor to have you with us tonight, Mr. Swan. - All that fancy talk is nice for some but we're here to protect our livelihood, not play politics. We need the water. - What did I promise you before I became Mayor? Of course you're going to get the water. But you can't expect Mr. Mitchell Swan to shut down his business operations for our sake. And should I have to remind all of you that Swan revenues plays an important role in our town's economy. (audience groaning) Settle down, settle down. Now you can boo all you want, but Mitchell Swan has assured me that he will use his considerable influence at the Woodward thrift and loan to ensure emergency funding for each and every one of you that qualify for drought aid. - Have to borrow money to break even, gonna end up owing more than it's worth. - All right, let's give it a try. (engine revving) (laughing) - Wherever you were headed, looks like you're gonna be late. - It's just a town meeting. They'll still being going strong by the time I get there. (honking) Things were a whole lot different when your mom was still around. - Ah Rosie does her best. - Yeah, yeah, she's an angel but that's not what I'm talkin' about. - I know, it's been tough on all of us though. - It has. I miss havin' you boys at my table to supper. It's such a small thing, is that too much to ask for? (soft music) How about helping an old man feel young again? - Well hop on, old man. - This is a situation that even the federal government has turned it's back on. - That's a damn lie, they're all lies. - You wait your turn like everyone else. - Mitchell Swan and his guys are nothing but blood sucking profiteers. How many more people around here are gonna have to lose their land or even die before we open our eyes to the fact of what's going on here? - The boy has nothing to say, now go home, kid. (gasping) Easy now, son. Put that gun down nice and easy. - Hey do you wanna tell them what's going on? Tell them the truth, you son of a bitch. - Calm down. - This whole town is under your control. - Now just put the gun down real slow. Put the gun down, drop it! (shooting) (heavy breathing) (indistinct talking) (soft music) - Hey dad, what's the problem? Hey dad, what's a matter? (sad rock music) (engine revving) (rock music) (police sirens blaring) - [Waldo] Darren's impatience was a clear indication that he was losing it, I should've seen it coming. (rock music) (police sirens blaring) (tires squealing) I will mourn your death, my young friend. 'Till mine. But I can't give into the grief or Swan will win. And I swear, I will not allow that. (police sirens ringing) (rock music) (horn honking) (soft rock music) (police radio mumbling) - 10-4. That's as far as you can go, boy. (tires screeching) - Are you all right? Come on, get up. - Where's Swan? - Look, you're hurt, we'll talk about this later. - We're gonna talk about it now. - Look, you asshole. You don't know who you're dealing with. - I'm the asshole? You're my brother, Jimmy. And Darren was my best friend. - Darren's the one that got out of control. Got in over his head. - You're one of 'em, aren't you? - Listen Bobby, Swan Water is my ticket out of this piss hole. And nobody's gonna screw it up for me. So don't you try. - I'm gonna get him. I swear I'm gonna get him. And when I do, I'm gonna get anybody who standing too close. Anybody. (rock music) - Jonathan, you can fume and fuss all you want that boy of yours has gotta be brought in. Peacefully or otherwise. - His best friend was murdered, damn it. - Barnes, lay off the kid. I'll make sure the farmer's get some water. (soft music) - Hiya Tommy. - Oh god. - What's a matter, you don't like 'em? - No way. - The old lady bought 'em for me. - Take it off. - They fit good, yeah these are good. (indistinct) (soft music) - We have had, we've had quite a run on farm loan applications. Uh, more than we can handle right now. - You take as many as you can get. I'll cover 'em all. You just make sure they're sign, sealed and go to forfeiture. - Yes sir, I understand. - Now I can only allow these people to take advantage of my good nature for just so long. (laughing) (roaring) - Oh help me, help me someone. There's a monster in my bed. - I'm not a monster. I'm me. - Me? Who's me? - Me, Elizabeth, don't you know me? - Oh, you, you. - My daddy gave it to me. - Well he must love you very much. (honking) - We're headin' into town for a beer. Thought you might like to join us. - Come on Bobby. We had no idea what he was doing. - I couldn't even see it comin'. - None of us could. - I should've seen it comin'. - How? - Darren knew who was in that plane. Man, he knew exactly who was in that plane. - Darren's workin' real close with Mr. Perkins. - Yeah, yeah, I heard that. - We're gonna find out what happened to Darren. - What happened? What do you mean what happened? Half the town saw him get blown away. - We lost a very close friend, Bobby. We understand how you feel. - How would you know anything about how I feel? What the fuck do you know about how I feel? You weren't his friend. You were in it for the money. He was payin' you, right? He was paying you, right? - Well he ain't payin' me anymore, Bobby. And you don't see me movin' on, do you? Huh? Now I gotta a suspicion on who killed Darren. - Oh you can forget it. You didn't need me before. - You're actin' just like Darren did after he saw the plane explode. Well come on Bobby, right now, you could get killed just as easily as he did if you don't cool down. I can't let these kids get involved in this. The stakes are much too heavy. Besides, getting rid of Swan is my job. - Find a place to park, we're gonna go have a drink with the big boys. - Bobby, I don't think it's a good idea to go in there. - Well then I suggest you don't come in, then. (soft country music) - The bank says I'm over my loan limit, I'd like to take you up on your offer. - I don't conduct business over my dinner. Come by the bank, see me in the morning. (soft country music) - Hey, hey, it's my shot. Let him take it. - Oh no, Sam, let me light that for you buddy. - Hey, that's my money, you son of a bitch. (dramatic music) - Get the fuck outta here. - Lead the way, asshole. - Hey come on guys, let's play nice now, huh? Hey guys. - I have to go powder my nose. - Don't overdo it. (soft music) - Bobby. I missed you Bobby. Please give me a chance to explain. - You don't have to explain anything to me. - Please, it was my only chance. - For what? For this? Look at you. - I've got everything I need and I'm paying the price for it. Everything I need, except you. - Why, why? What the fuck are you waitin' for? - I'll spring for the gas, you go get the beer, Joe. - Guys can you forget the beer? Will you just take me on home? - Go get the beer. One for the road, right Bobby. - Oh yeah right, one, two, three, ten, what does it matter? As long as I get good and drunk. The booze isn't the answer. You know, a guy I thought was a friend of mine once told me that. It's funny, isn't it? Oh fuck this town. I gotta get away from this shit. - Bobby, come on. (soft music) Bobby, I've been after Swan a long time. Long before Darren's father died. I asked for Darren's help, not the other way around. Money was never the issue. What I believe is that Darren's father was murdered, just like my brother. When they found out what was going on at the lake. Swan doesn't give a shit about bottling water. All he cares about is what's going on under the lake. - I thought you were a friend of mine. Why didn't you tell me about any of this before? - Hey, now get this straight Bobby, I am your friend. Darren and I felt it would be better if we let you out of this. Swan runs a very tight operation down by the lake. Very tight. But I'm gonna get him, I'm gonna nail his ass. - All your promises, they didn't help keep Darren alive. Damn it, didn't you care about him at all? (soft music) All your promises, they didn't keep Darren alive. Damn it, didn't you care about him at all. - [Friend] Who the hell do you think you are? Do you think you're the only friend Darren ever had? - [Darren] Yeah well I don't see you gettin' too choked up about his death. - [Friend] How the hell would you know man? The only thing you're choked up over is some small town slutty dump. All this time we wondered where the hell you've been when all this shit's been goin' on. Well I'll tell you man, you're nowhere. With that shit attitude of yours, that's where you're gonna stay. (vomiting) (upbeat music) - Well, well, you're up early this morning. Would you like some breakfast? - No thanks. - Where you goin' this early? What happened? Got a job? - Waldo is missing. - Did he say anything about where he was goin'? - Not really. He said he might have a tip on some kind of shipment though. - Maybe your brother knows where he is. - Maybe, maybe not. Don't expect him to tell us anything. - What if something really bad happened to Waldo this time? What are we gonna do? - We're gonna get him. That's what we're gonna do. - [Hank] Sure is pretty. - Nature is grand. You know, the best thing about it Hank? It's all fuckin' mine. (laughing) I want this to be celebration of American values. 'Cause only in America Hank. I want this to be a celebration that people here are gonna remember for years. And I want everything on the house, everything. Courtesy of Swan Water. - Yes sir, on the house? - And I want American flags, red, white and blue American flags everywhere. And I want that big ribbon stuff, all over that bandstand, all over. - Yes sir. - Red, white and blue. There's something so appealing about those colors. Somethin' so symbolic. Don't you think so, Hank? - Yes sir. Appealing and symbolic, I think so. - Take me to this guy and let's get this whole unpleasantness over with. - Well he's not in real good shape, sir. But he can still talk. (dramatic music) - You're a magician, George. (rock music) (screaming) (mumbling) - You know you're gonna have to talk sooner or later. (groaning) It's the only way to stop the pain. (heavy breathing) Believe me, I'm not a violent person. In fact, I abhor it. (screaming) Now that I have your attention, what I wanna know is, are you a relative of Uncle Sam? I call him Uncle, don't I? (laughing) Are you gonna talk to me? (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (mumbling) - Okay, which one of you clowns wants a couple days vacation? - What's the catch? - What's up? - Well remember that Waldo character? Well now he's going to the newspapers. We need somebody up there to look around. Keep a low profile, the story checks out, great. If not, we'll keep him in the wacko file. - Hell, I'll take that, right? - No problem. I'll go. (soft music) - [Deborah] Please tell me that you're waiting for me, even if it's a lie. - [Bobby] It would still be a lie. - I know you can never really hate me for what I did. You've always had such a forgiving heart. (soft music) Sometimes that makes me so jealous. Do you remember that time you went out on that date with Paula? - Just shut up, just shut up. You run off with a guy who's twice your age. Why the hell did you even come back? - Just thinking about you kept me alive. Gave me hope that maybe, I wish I could be your friend again, Bobby. Don't take me back, I don't wanna go back. - Well I can't leave you here. - Yes you can, it's easy. Please hold me for awhile, please. (soft music) (soft sexy music) (heavy breathing) (soft music) - What took you so long? - Let's go over the plan one more time. (dramatic music) - Having a private party, are we? - Yeah, you like some? (laughing) - Why not? It was a terrific day. How you doin', hun? (snorting) This is great stuff. This is great stuff. It's cheaper than the water around here. Get it? (laughing) I sell water around here for more than I pay for this shit. Some day I'm gonna deliver it to every household in the country. I'll be known as Swan Water and Powder. (laughing) What's a matter? Try it. This is gonna make you feel a lot better because this is the creme de le creme. - I really don't feel good tonight. - Try it, you'll like it. - No. (groaning) No! (crying) No. - Snort it. - No! - Snort it! (crying) Again! - No. (crying) - You feel better already, huh? - No, please no. - Daddy's gonna make you feel so much better. - No! - Then you take it off, or I will. Yeah. - Bobby, what are you doin'? What a minute, you didn't say anything about having it loaded. (dramatic music) Where's Waldo? - Waldo who? - Where's Waldo? - Fuck you, asshole. - Don't make me ask you again. - Go to hell. - Tell me! - You keep pushing this thing, Bobby, and you're dead meat. - Tell me or I swear to God, I'm gonna. - Who do you think you're dealin' with here? Some high school kids. (shooting) Bobby no, Bobby, I'm your brother. - You're not my brother. Darren was.

Let's show Mr. Swan the people in this town are appreciative that we're alive and well and know how to party. Remember, only today's participates during the rehearsal can secure front row seats for the upcoming concert. It's gonna be fine. Half a dozen live bands, free food, free drinks, fireworks and oh man, I tell you, I am so excited about the whole thing, I could go on and on and on. (dramatic upbeat music) - Remember Bobby, if anything goes wrong, just get out, don't be a hero. (dramatic music) (upbeat rock music) (soft music) - Lay back. - Yeah. - Let me move this bowl. - Oh I liked it where it was. (hissing) (heavy breathing) (soft music) - [Bobby] I thought you were a friend of mine. Why didn't you tell me anything about this before? - [Waldo] Hey, now get this straight, Bobby. I am your friend. Swan's heart beat is in the lake. And I know the area where you can walk on water. His boys can't stop me.

All I ever wanted for you people was to enjoy the good life and share in my fortune. You aren't fuckin' with some local cowboy, you're fuckin' with me. And you just ruined everything I ever cared about. (shooting) (groaning) You bitch! (shooting) (shooting) - Don't move, federal agents, drop your guns. Everybody down, on your knees. - Get down, stay down. - Get down, everybody get down.
