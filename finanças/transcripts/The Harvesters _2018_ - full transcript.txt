Our father, we ask you humbly to breathe in the Holy Spirit. And that He helps us to save this child. Janno. My Janno. Mum ? There is a child in the living room who needs you Welcomes it. Open your heart to him. He does not know us. He does not understand that we want to help him. Janno, open your heart to him. God, Mary, you had to choose the worst of all? Jan, good or bad, it's the strength that counts. And this boy is full of strength. It's not what we hoped. Janno will know how to love him. Janno will help him to rebuild himself. You ask too much. Who, Jan? Whose ? It's my mother, my father and my aunt in the other room. It is my family. Me, it's Janno. You are my brother now. Come on, we're not going to hurt you. It's good. Take off your shirt. Come on, take off your top. Aunt ? Why does he eat like this? It's also an Afrikaner? Yes, he is afrikaner. Sister? Goodbye. - Be strong. - Thank you. Call me tomorrow. Goodbye, Pieter. I was happy to meet you. When you get better, you can visit us at our farm. Okay. It's a beginning. I can not sleep. Wake up. What are you doing ? It's just a butter knife he is afraid. Afraid? What's his problem ? He is sick ? He is missing. We had been warned. Jan, I'll take care of it. Take care of the children. Go back to bed. Our father in heavens... Janno. I know, I should already be outside. At my age, Mom, you were already ready and at work, at this time. - Where were you? - Excuse me, Dad. File work. Let us pray. Lord, we ask you to get rid evil that lives in us. We are happy that Father is visiting us, but it would have to come and settle at one of us. No ! He does not want to live with you. Father? Father knows he is dangerous to live alone. Everyday, Farmers are killed and it gets worse. Alina, do you understand? No ! Father, you will not be able soon no longer refuse. Look who has come to say hello. Grandpa is okay today? I do not know you. Come. Father, of course that you know him. Do not pay attention, he's senile. When will he meet the new? New... If he does something fishy, if he's taking drugs or whatever, you tell me, OK? Yes Dad. I will have it in my eye. Always sick ? I wish I had my breakfast in bed. You look better. Do you sleep better? I speak Afrikaans. I'm supposed to show you the corner. Do you like rugby? OKAY. Awesome ! Leave them! Janno, give up! Can we play now? It's okay ? Shut up ! Leave it alone. Come on, we'll have fun. Guide the men of our community who will go to the camp, and the women who stay at home. Lord, help us to pass our exams this year and to obtain a fruitful harvest. Hello, my sisters. Hi my brother. Is he really an Afrikaner? New. I'm tall enough to tell Mom what I feel. Yes, it's true. Everything is different, since he is here. I do not like it. We made a choice. But it's not my brother. He will never be my brother. There are so few of us left, Janno. Afrikaners. One day, you will understand. Understand what ? Do you know what I believe? Why he arrived with us? Here, up to us? Because God sent it. Yes, Janno. Open to him your heart, as you did with your sisters. God has led him to us and we must submit to His decisions. Janno, if we do not welcome ours, Who's gonna do it ? He will run away. Make sure he stays. This is our test, to us all. I can not leave this child to get lost in the dark night. I will not confront Judgment last with this weight on the conscience. Help me. She is my wife, with her father. She was born in this house. She is the bourgeois of the family. And there, it's his sister. The one who died. The little ones were his daughters. That's the grandfather. And here it is ... This is our family. There I am. - I thought he was better. - It's the case. Sarah, go back to bed. Wake up. Pieter, wake up. It's only a nightmare. It will be fine. We start the day like this. We do it for you. Take a seat. Sitting! Our father, thank you for this alarm clock united and in family. Every member of this family is essential. It is the same for you. Sarah. And thank you, Lord, to maintain our family united. And to grow corn, so that we can harvest it, and to provide a roof above our heads. Thanks for the cattle, thank you for protecting us against the farmer killers, and for all your blessings. And thank you for sending us Pieter. Amen. Put it there, near the window. He says he has nightmares, alone in his room. - Hello, Alina. - Hello. Hello ! - He waited for us? - Not really. Father. Say hello to the new. This is Pieter. Hello, Pieter. Hello. Father. Say hello. Do not touch my business! Do you have something to eat? They `re my best friend. Hennie. He will be president of the students, this year. You have nothing to eat? A cigarette ? It's like being in jail. It's a stray dog. You can not keep it. Not on the bed. What's your delirium? I do not know what your father will say. Do you want to call him how? - Dog. - Dog? Where are we going ? - It's cold. - Take my jacket. Come. Everything is fine ? How's Pieter? Climb in a combine and get to work. Slowly. Slowly. Keep it steady. Make sure that the blades stay straight. Turn a little. Well done, man! What are we going to do with him? He was there, to chat with these people. He thinks he's a man. Jan, that's enough! And what's more, you smoke in the field? Leave it alone. He can not stay inside. What were you talking about, Mom and you, in the living room ? Pieter, wake up. I thought it was over. Let me go, asshole! Standing. We will pray. On your knees. Marie, I control the situation! If you prayed in the evening before bed, you would not have nightmares. Come on, hands joined. Our father. Our father. Put your gaze on us, Your humble servants, and on this child to enlighten his soul from your divine light. We entrust you this boy. Thank you Lord. Listen to me carefully. People will watch you. Be polite. If they talk to you, you shake their hand. You call them "my uncle" and "my aunt". Including ? You are all lobotomized. Swear to serve our Lord and to honor His name in this church? What is your answer ? - Binkie? - Yes. - Willem? - Yes. - Martelize? - Yes. - Hennie? - Yes. - Herman? - Yes. - Hansie? - Yes. - Christo? - Yes. By virtue of the laws of his Grace delivered during your baptism and during your communion, you are now members of NG Church, Bethlehem. Congratulations. Here they are. Does this ring a bell ? Tertia Brits, arrested for prostitution at 13 years old, pregnant at 15. The father was a certain Braam of Wet, 27 years old, his boyfriend and pimp. They left the baby, called Pieter, to their owner and have disappeared. Five years later, T. Brits overdosed. She is found alone and died alone ... Dad ! You are one of us now. You'll have to do it. You do not have to finish like your mother and your father. What is in us can be as harmful than the outside world. Solitude is a sickness. Do not have family is a disease. Do not be a part of a community that loves you is a disease. I am not alone. You were almost dead when we found you. This city has almost killed you! Keep it in mind, because tomorrow, you'll apologize to the pastor. It's not that hard to be normal. You reach out and say: "Nice to meet you." You call them "my uncle" and "my aunt". I'm sorry for your mother. I do not have a mother. If God is love, then He does not exist. Because He does not love me. Applaud all And rejoice in the glory of God Raise your voice and proclaim His name In all the cities of the earth Sing, sing and sing in chorus And praise His glorious name Because it is our king in the eternal, on earth as in heaven You know her ? Mate that. Come on, do not be fooled! Dude, iron later, I'm busy. You did not have to apologize to the pastor? Where do you think I met her? Leave me alone. Do you have money? She wants a soda. Come on, brother. Hi guys. Hello. You went fishing? - You had good catches. - Yeah. Why did not you call me? We saw you in church yesterday. See you. That's it, your "friends"? It's your fault. - It's because of you. - Me ? What did I do? You did it to screw up my shot. Viewing. Go get fucked, little fools of shit! You want to fuck me your dicks from busty to ass? Come, little pedals! I can be gay for a little money. I am open. You're a fucking sick, you! Do you want more? I fucked your mother yesterday, she was naze. Stop! Come on, we'll break. You will get AIDS by touching it. You think What is the real world? I know him, the real world. Here is a fucking hole lost! It's nothing. It's okay ? And you, the chouineuse? I did that for you. It's not your brothers or your friends. They do not know who you really are. You have to wake up. It's my friend. It's okay ? I hate these guys. They believe that this city belongs to them. You worried? And if we were a quiet corner? Go away. Janno, wait. She had a deep desire for me. Fucking tease! Shit ! Almost ! Huh, my brother? Brother? Dude, what's your problem? Where were you when I melted the earth? Say it, if you have intelligence. Are you the links of the Pleiades, or do you detach the ropes Orion? Do you know the laws of heaven? Do you rule his power on earth? Are you lightening? Do they leave? Do they say to you, "Here we are"? Who put wisdom in the heart? Who gave the intelligence in mind ? The world is consumed by the flames and we all burn, children. Here, farmers have been dragged on the roads and killed. The farmer is a species in danger. How to be sure that God exists and that He will return? It's not thanks to the pastor or to the other faithful. Their opinion does not matter. The opinion of the outside world does not count. No, thanks to to His one and only present, His word. And if we obey His word, no one can judge us, no one can tell us what we are. Even if they kill us, we will always be free. Hello, Tienus? Wait, Tienus. I'm coming very soon. Excuse me. You two, come with me. Come. What is happening ? There is one there. And another here. Hey, little, I heard about you. You let go of your dog in my field. That's enough, Tienus. I will compensate you. Come see. I saw. Come see ! I found him here, with my sheep. I will find a solution. Get in the pickup. Pieter, no! He is mine. He is mine. I can do it. Leave him alone, he is mine. Please, leave. I can do it. He is mine. Not easy to be a parent. I will compensate you. - I, too, loved him. - We do not care about dogs. Where are you going ? You know nothing. You do not live. Whore of shit bled. Pieter, where are we going? We must return. We will have a little fun. Take it easy. Thank you my brother. It's cool, huh? You see, that's the bursts. Tell me these little Chinese girls, they are good. Are we hugging them just now? 300 above the belt. 600 below. How old are you ? Thirteen years. Come. No ! What are you doing ? Do not give me that blow! - What are you going to do with this old man? - You make me feel ashamed! Where are you going ? When can we bring him back? Today. Thank you. Jan, wait. Let me do it, please. Leave me alone. Go away. We must think of our girls. God, Mary. What's the matter with you ? We have everything we need. Please. You are a coward, Jan. It's only a child. A child like the others. Our father, make this boy strong. Make his heart strong. Make sure his seed is strong. Make this boy strong. Make his heart strong. Make sure his blood is strong. Make sure his seed is strong. I can not save him without your help. We must save him. You imagine how his life was terrible in town? He said he liked it. It may have been a good life, a better life. Maybe we're wrong. Maybe we are bad. - I do not recognize you. - I do not understand what he's doing there. Understand ? Do you think we have to understand? All we can do, it's believing, Janno. Sorry. I am sorry. I forgive you. I love you so much. I'm afraid. We send you to the boys' camp, for several days. It will be like a vacation. You can walk, to train, to pray. You will take the opportunity to think carefully, because when you come back, everything will have to be different. Did you understand me? Desperate cases are sent to the camp. You should stop yourself. Do not tell anyone that you left with this guy, otherwise they will think that I do the same, while I am wise! At least I know what I am. And what are you? Just white meat. When will you go there? It is important. I did not know that Grandpa was there. What a good surprise. I bring you something? Where do I call Alina? I came to see you. Listen to me, I know who you are. Thank you, Grandpa. This land is mine. I spent my life working and you will never have it. You will not have it, So fuck you! Go back to the street. You will not have what is mine. Dirty little shit! You must confuse me with the other. His name is Pieter. He comes from the city. Little shit pedal! - Let go of me ! - Ordure! Let go of me ! I want to go back home. Bring me home. First, you want to come here and now, you want to go home! You are in a funny mood, today. One day, this farm will be mine, Grandfather. One day. You are looking good. Thank you, aunt. The air of the countryside succeeds you. Come. When I was your age, and that I was at the orphanage, I kept the babies in the evening. How were they? I loved them. What was their name? So, there was Tebang, Tebogo and Mandla. Every night, at bedtime, I sang to them a lullaby. Do you want to hear it? You sing with me? You sing with me? It was nice. With my sisters. I need more to be in your room. It went well ? - What's on your back? - Your friend did that to me. Which friend ? Scout, Hennie. This pastor's cunt made him lower my pants and whip me with his belt. Why ? It's that kind of place. I do not care. I knew worse. Now, we're friends, Hennie and me. It's not true. He wants to show me things. He told me things. What kind of things? One day, you asked me to pray with you. Our father, thank you for guiding me to this house and give me a brother like Janno. He would never be friend with someone like you. And Janno, who guided me, never lied to me, who loved me, without judging me, while I did not deserve it. Amen. What are you doing ? I learned beautiful about you, at the camp, by your friend scout. This idiot, there! Your boyfriend, the Good Samaritan, and his friends told me everything on you and your mother. My mother ? She is dry. Sterile. She did not give you birth. They found you rotting in an orphanage of the Free State. God made her my mother. Yeah, you've never had parents, you've never been the son from anyone. Dirty monster! Our father, We humbly implore you to guide us to our home. Lord, thank you for having us gathered for this lesson. Help us to put this knowledge in practice and let everything go well. Our father, thank you for bringing us together. Deliver us Your word tonight and allow us to understand it. Accompany us on the way back. Good night girls. I am your only son. You pretend to love him. Why are you doing the child? If you lose your way, it will only be flames and last Judgment. You think I'm weak and that he is strong. It's our duty. Every night, I wonder: Is my faith strong enough? Or am I only a Judas? Am I weak? No, God wanted me to love my two sons. You and me, we must accept His decision. He is not better than me. Go. You are really crazy both. You still want to get rid of me? Yes. She will never love us. No. You, I thought you would like me, my brother". You're supposed to tell me that I am good as I am. You, I believe you. But it's not big deal. Men fiddle with me for money and I'm proud of it. I would not have survived if I had hoped they loved me. I sold myself and they spun me money. I can survive everything. Even a crappy brother like you. So do not be sorry for me. In fact, I pity you. You think I do not know respect my elders, shake their hands sweaty perverts? The city is full of boys who greet old people in cars. And there, I sold myself again for food and a good bed. I love that. She can squeeze me against her, she died inside. And I do not care. Not like you. You're so selfish. You want everything for yourself. When the real world will knock on your door, you will not hold two minutes, my brother. That, she knows it too. That's why she chose me for his precious farm. She knows me too, I died inside. Hit ! Keep on going ! My brother ! My brother ! Where are you ? Do not leave me with them! Kiss my ass ! It's always your son. I wanted to start a family and I failed. But no. He will be back. He will be back. I lose my children. I lose my children. Pieter. Pieter, my brother, you think you're made for this land, but your destiny is to pass and disappear Without leaving a trace. She will never be part of you as she is part of me. My brother, everything you have is mine. HARVESTERS Subtitling: ECLAIR
