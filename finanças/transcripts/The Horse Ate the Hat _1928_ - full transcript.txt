AN ITALIAN STRAW HAT Yes, Papa. My cousin'll help me... I'm ready. Hurry, Bobin, the fianc?'s waiting for us... Through the Vincennes Woods Ferdinand the fianc? drives to his new home. A pin slipped... At the apartment prepared for the married couple... I'm Mr. Vesinet, the bride's uncle. The wedding party's to be held here? The wedding party mustn't see me... I'm too nervous... I'd faint... Lady's married! She can't go home to her husband without a hat like this... Find one for her! She's dying... I can't leave her. Get one like this sample of Italian straw... If you don't obey, I'll smash everything... Say one word to sully the lady's honour and I'll slay you tomorrow in a duel! I had an Italian straw hat but I sold it. A very rare one! To whom did you sell it? Here's Mme de Beauperthuis' address. She bought a similar hat... Tell your master I've waited long enough. Destruction is about to begin... Maybe the hat's been delivered... Don't let him break everything! Tell him I'm on the trail of something similar. He's not far... We can follow him... At Mme de Beauperthuis. I'm not a thief. I merely wish to ask your wife for a hat... It looks like my son-in-law's home... I must have her hat at any cost... by fair means or foul... I've been here before. It's my son-in-law's apartment... I'll wait for you. My friends, as I place this myrtle by the marriage bed let me say a few words... Sir, you could do me a great favor... Let me tell you what happened to me. You'll understand why you must give me your wife's hat... You say this man and... this woman are at your home. What is your address? I've finished... My daughter, I must now entrust you to your husband... You're mistaken... We're not at home here. Let's go! Where does that young man live? My ear trumpet is no longer plugged! I can hear what people say. I gave him your address... Go home... I'll meet you there. I must face the revenge of a furious husband! Is my son-in-law here? My master says no one may enter so long as the lady is here... A woman here! On his wedding night! It's too much! I'm taking my girl home... Since it's all over, let's take our gifts away... It's my gift... An Italian straw hat for my niece... It'll all work out. Wait for me... He's gone crazy! Let's leave quickly... Your husband knows everything about the hat... He's coming! But he won't understand a thing! I found another one just like it. I can't go home without my hat. My husband would realise everything... I'll get the hat, I know the chief... It's all been explained... I forgive you. It's alright, Papa. I'll explain it... My husband is a gentleman. English Adaptation: Jaib WARNER Laser subtitling TITRA Paris
