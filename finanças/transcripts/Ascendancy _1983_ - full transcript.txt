WOMAN NARRATES: 'Sometimes I sleep during the day. 'Or rather I pretend to sleep. 'I sit with my eyes closed 'and listen to the lies they tell about you.' Good afternoon, I'm sorry to bother you. Do you have any identification? - Had any trouble? - DRIVER: No. - Seen anything suspicious? - DRIVER: No. - Where are you going? - Belfast. 'How long is it? 'Three years, four? '100? 'It makes no difference. 'I remember everything. 'I keep it safe inside me.' HOOTER BLARES 'Last night, I saw you in a dream. 'You stared at me without speaking 'and turned your face away. 'Are you angry? 'Have you forgotten me? 'Don't you know I am still waiting for you 'here in this terrible place?' Connie? We're home. "Behold, I have divided unto you by lot "these nations that remain, "to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan "with all the nations that I have cut off, "even unto the great sea westward. "Be ye therefore very courageous to keep "and to do all that is written "in the book of the law of Moses, "that ye turn not aside therefrom "to the right hand or to the left; "that ye come not among these nations, "these that remain among you; "neither make mention of the name of their gods, "nor cause to swear by them, "neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them: "But cleave unto the Lord your God, "as ye have done unto this day." How are you feeling this morning? You look better. Am I better? Her arm's still a little bit stiff. Otherwise, we're on the mend. What do you propose to do with yourself today? Oh, I expect I shall read a little. She spends her whole time reading at the moment. Oh, really? What sort of thing? Zola, Shaw, Dostoevsky... That sort of thing. They sound like socialists to me. Actually, they're Harry's books. I found them in his room. Look, Connie, we only want you to be happy. You know that, don't you? But, Father, I am happy. 'Every day is the same. 'Father goes off to make money, 'and I'm left alone to think of you. 'They torture me horribly.' Are you ready, Con...? Ah! SHE GASPS NURSE: Just hold still, Connie. DOCTOR: How many? Four. No, three. - Are you sure? - I looked. Hm. Now, this isn't meant to hurt you. You're to tell me if it hurts. HIGH-PITCHED WHINING Can you feel that? Can you feel that? Can you feel that? And that? HE WHISTLES Hey, come on! This way! THEY YELL THEY CONTINUE YELLING We'll show ya! 'Everything I do is watched. 'They spy on me continually. 'But I am too clever for them.' DOOR KNOB RATTLES Rose! That's enough now, Connie! Connie, come on now. Connie... SHE SOBS GERMAN ACCENT: Herr Schulz asks, is the piece finished, or still to be adapted for his particular order? In principle, the unit is designed so that only minor modifications are needed for any individual requirement. Herr Schulz's included, of course? Ja, ja, verstanden. MEN SPEAK IN GERMAN Why don't you read your book, Connie? We could play cards if you like. Well? Have they bought a ship? Not yet. I'm sure they're absolutely charming, and it doesn't matter a bit that we've only just fought a war against them. What do you think? They haven't made up their mind yet. Could go either way. Oh, Mr Vesey, you haven't told me what you thought of my performance. You know how I value your opinion. - I thought it was splendid! - Did you really? I sometimes think that only having the use of one hand has affected my playing. THEY SPEAK GERMAN Danke. Mr Wintour, Herr Schulz is very satisfied with the designs. Very, very good. But he is worried of delays, should our company wish to place an order. We've heard you have many strikes here at the moment. Herr Schulz need not concern himself on that score. HE TRANSLATES The industrial situation is under control. HE TRANSLATES It's true there have been some problems, but I'm confident they'll be resolved very shortly. 'Why don't you answer my letters? 'Doesn't the Army deliver them? 'Don't worry. 'I know a way to reach you.' Hurry up, Connie, the doctor will be here in a minute. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Now, that's a fine sight, isn't it? Come along. Is it summer already? THEY SHOUT Ah, just... Listen, you, there's a war going on here! THEY SHOUT Are you sure you don't want to come? The doctor says it's all right, you know. As long as Nurse comes with you. CONNIE: I really don't feel up to it, Father. That's a pity. You look absolutely ridiculous. I do wish you'd take a bit more interest in the outside world, Connie. Why should I take an interest in grown men marching up and down like children? Because it's part of our tradition. Waving flags isn't a tradition, it's just a nasty habit. Anyway, I don't believe it means anything to you either. Of course it means something to me. I wouldn't do it otherwise. It's struck 12, sir. Do you not mind being left on your own now? Why would I mind? Just thought that... Well, I suppose it's better for your sort to keep out of the way today. You've no call to worry about me, you know. By the left, quick march! MARCHING DRUMS MARCHING BAND MUSIC KEY RATTLES IN LOCK 'Oh, my brother, my brother, 'why have you left me here alone?' KNOCK ON DOOR NURSE: Connie? Are you in there? Connie, I know you're in there. Open the door. Connie, left me in! Connie, let me in, please. We know that the real battlefield of Ireland in relation to a Republic must be Ulster. CROWD CLAMOUR We know that Sinn Féin's one ambition is to penetrate into Ulster. CROWD YELL No surrender! ..the reality of the situation. What I say is this - these men who come forward posing as the friends of Labour care no more about Labour than the man in the moon! Their real object and the real insidious aim of their propaganda is to bring disunity among our people, to force on us the same bondage and slavery that we see being imposed in the rest of Ireland. Nurse, Nurse! Connie! Connie, leave Billy...! Connie, don't be so silly! - Ow! - Calm down! Connie, no! Calm down, Connie, now. Come on now, don't be so silly. Connie, keep still. Connie! MUFFLED SOBS Oh, do stop crying, Rose. It's always like this. It happens every year. It'll be over in a day or two, you know that. MUFFLED SOBS CONTINUE For heaven's sake, stop crying! Nobody minds what church you go to here. On behalf of the men brutally expelled from your yard, we demand that you take steps to ensure that all such men be reinstated immediately. Or are you going to let these hooligans tell you what to do? I hope you'll bear in mind that this company has never had a sectarian policy towards its employees. On the contrary, we've always employed Protestants and Roman Catholics in equal numbers. As long as they weren't members of a trade union... However, in the present political atmosphere, I don't find it difficult to understand the unease of a loyal shipyard hand constrained to work alongside a nationalist. We're not Sinn Féin! I warn you, I will tolerate no rebellion in this yard! CROWD YELL We're wasting our time. Well... Believe me, I regret this outbreak as much as you do. Apart from anything else, it's costing me money! But my hands are tied. I can't force my employees to work with men they don't trust. I have to respect their wishes. Let's just hope you can finish off what you've started, Wintour. For everyone's sake. How she ever got a job here in the first place... She shouldn't be here. Look, she's a pape. She'll stop at nothing, same as the rest of them. I thought she was different. Different, come on! - There you are. - Thank you, Billy. SHE SCREAMS You are thinking of nothing. Nothing but what I say. Your eyes are closed. Comfortably closed. You are thinking of nothing. Nothing but what I say. You are relaxed. Relaxed. Your whole body feels relaxed. Open your eyes. I want you to listen carefully to what I say. Carefully to what I say. You will raise your left arm. Your left arm. Now I want you to raise your right arm. Your right arm. You will raise your right arm. Extraordinary! Quite extraordinary! 'Listen, 'something terrible has happened. 'A man came into my room while I was asleep. 'He stripped me naked and touched me all over. 'He whispered obscene words in my ear. 'He made me break my promise to you.' KEY RATTLES IN LOCK 'You must help me. 'You must help your little sister.' Here, let me help you. We'd better hurry. No, you're too clumsy. Ring for Rose. She'll do it. I thought you knew. Rose isn't here any more. What did you say? This beastly curfew, I think you're horrid - we have to be in early every evening. No, you don't. How's that? Well... You can always go home in the morning. Is that your opinion, Colonel? Oh! I believe there is Bolshevism at work here, yes. But it hardly seems credible. Who do these disorders benefit? The Sinn Féin. And what do the Sinn Féiners want? The destruction of the British Empire. And who stands to gain most by that destruction, eh? Father says they're holding raffles to see who gets the best land. After we've all been killed, I suppose. Good Lord! Yes. Let's hope you get them first. Well, it's not exactly our job, you know. This is my daughter, Connie. What do you think of the fishing fleet? I think I might click over there. Not a chance. You're much too fat. HE LAUGHS So I said, "What sort of army is it "that doesn't have any ranks?" Then he drew himself up, as bold as you like, and said, "The Irish Republican Army!" THEY CHUCKLE Any idea who he is? I suppose he's another loyal Ulsterman. Sober, upright, God-fearing. Only heaven help you if you don't fear the same god. Ah, but didn't you know? "The Protestant boys are true to the last "And faithful and peaceful when danger has passed." I wish they were more peaceful. Between ourselves, they're as much trouble as the other lot. - Who is he, anyway? - He's my brother. He's dead. There, now you're ashamed. "And, oh, they bear and proudly wear "The colours that floated o'er many affray "When cannons were flashing and sabres were clashing "The Protestant boys still carried the day." Sorry, I should have guessed. Where was it? The Somme, like everybody else around here? Yes. I didn't get a chance to fight. I don't think there's much to it. You just stand there and keep shooting at each other until one of you is dead. Why were you wounded? 'I remember your last day. 'The room was crowded, 'and for a moment I did not recognise you. 'Your voice was deeper, 'and the Army had changed the way you walk. 'And what about me? 'Have I changed, too?' Are you coming or not? - Wait, wait, I'm coming. - Have you got it? Oh, yeah. - Come on. - Right, go on. HE RAPS AT DOOR GUNSHOT SHOUTS: No surrender! It says here you're a hard worker. MEEKLY: Yes, sir. FORCEFULLY: Yes, sir! I've been in service since I was 11, sir. And I'm never sick. I hope you realise that as my daughter's personal maid, you may find yourself in some unfamiliar situations. She lives very much in her own world, I'm afraid. You see, she finds it harder to break free from the past than we do. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes, sir. You see, her health is very precarious. There may be times when your assistance will be called for. I'm sure I'd be able to manage, sir. You can rely on me. I hope we may. Well, then, that's settled. I trust you'll be happy here. I think you'll find everyone friendly enough. Yes. Thank you, sir. Oh, there is just one thing. We have prayers every morning at eight. You'll have no objection to attending? I'm not a Catholic, if that's what you mean, sir. It's the other servants, you see. I couldn't care if you were a Hindu myself, but we have to take their views into consideration. Oh, that's all right, sir. You've got nothing to worry about there. Good, good. 'They want to take you from me. 'What they cannot get by force, 'they try to steal by trickery.' CHURCH CLOCK CHIMES 'They are too strong for me. 'I am afraid they are too strong for me.' I loathe Remembrance Day. Everybody pretends to be thinking about the dead, but really they're just pleased with themselves for being alive. That's unfair. Who were you thinking about, then? Oh, you know, absent friends. Someone special? GUNSHOTS I tried to think about Harry. But he's become a sort of blur. I can still see parts of him. His hands. The back of his neck. His eyebrows. But they don't fit together any more. HE GROANS AND WHEEZES NURSE: On the table, put him on the table! Hold his head. Connie, come away! HYPNOTHERAPIST: Open your eyes. What can you see? There are bodies everywhere! What are you doing? I'm looking for Harry. I can't find him! That's because Harry's in heaven. No! Harry's in heaven. He's happy, and he wants you to be happy, too. He wants you to forget about him. Nurse? 'You said the cause was just 'and God was on our side. 'But I felt Father's eyes upon you, 'and I heard his words in your mouth.' - Where were you at the time? - In the kitchen, sir. Did you see anything? No, sir. Do you know of any reason for the attack? No, sir. Your name? Mary McCagg. And you're Miss Wintour's personal maid? Yes, sir. And you've been here how long? A month and a half, sir. Is all this really necessary? Well, your father's an important man - got to look after him. OFFICER: Address? MARY: 14 North Street. - Faith? - Protestant. CONNIE: It's very ugly. Now, you mustn't despise barbed wire. It's cheap, it's effective. And they tell me that, seen at dawn across no-man's-land, it even has a certain austere beauty. But this isn't no-man's-land, this is my home. Do you really think they were trying to kill my father? That seems to be the theory. But why should anyone want to do that? Well, I might, if I was a Catholic. Why? I might feel a little bitter about some of the things he and his friends have been saying recently. But my father doesn't care about religion. He's only interested in making money. What if you were a Protestant? Then I'd be thankful that he had my best interests at heart. I don't suppose you have a point of view of your own. Oh, I'm just a simple soldier. Obeying orders. You know? Like your brother. Don't say that. Why not? I only just missed the war by a couple of months, you know. We were just getting ready to go out there when the news came. I always assumed I'd be killed. Were you afraid? More afraid now. I say, I think we found something rather interesting. Take a look at that. Where did you get this? One of the servants' bedrooms, under the mattress. MAN: In my mind, there can be no alternative. WINTOUR: To me, it seems rather a drastic solution. Look at the arithmetic. With six counties, we can hold the line. With nine, they're like numbers in a couple of generations. At the rate they breed! The point is those six have got to be secure. WINTOUR: Frankly, it's Belfast that concerns me. We'll have a free hand here soon. Then we'll have a proper clean-out. That's just what I'm worried about. We've got a big order coming in from Germany. I don't want my men off chasing Fenians all day. We've only just got back to full production. You see, we'd like a bit of peace right now. You'll get your bit of peace soon enough, but you'll have to fight for it first, that's all. Good God, man! This is your country. Can't you see your duty? But I've told you, I'm not a politician, I'm a businessman. And that's just the kind of man we need. What do you say, Miss Wintour? How do you like the idea of your father as a member of the first parliament of Northern Ireland? Oh, I think it sounds absolutely splendid. 'Each evening, a strange murmur drifts in from the city. 'It sounds like laughter. 'Young men go drinking with their friends. 'Women put on new dresses for their husbands. 'Children are born. 'The war is so far away. 'Why do you have to fight?' Well, how do I look? You look grand, boy. I feel grand. I wish I was your age again. What are they doing? They're going to help the Army, miss. Help them do what? Keep the papishes down, miss. What do you mean? You know, miss, the Fenians. To stop them taking over. You can take these to the Sergeant. Yes, sir. FAINT MILITARY ORDERS SHOUTED Father, I want to ask you something. Connie, how would you like to go back to England for a while? Back to sanity. I could join you later. - What do you say? - It's about the Army. Oh, yes. Nurse told me you'd taken a shine to that young lieutenant. I have no objection, you know. I thought we might invite him over with some of his friends. Seems a pleasant enough fellow. Good at his job, by all accounts. What exactly is his job? He's a soldier! HYPNOTHERAPIST: Where are you? At home. In the war. What are you doing? Waiting. For what? For Harry. He's coming home. From the front? Oh, no. He's not in the Army. They want him to volunteer, but he won't. He said so. It's the summer holidays. BIRDS CHIRP Hello, Connie. It's me, Harry. How do I look? I'm a lieutenant now. You've been lying to me! 'Why do you listen to them? Why do you listen to them? 'Why do you stand so patiently by 'while they steal away your youth?' THEY LAUGH Let's do this arm. And that. Let's put this on now. Connie, would you keep still, please? Well, hurry up! They're here already! Where do you want it putting, miss? CONNIE: I'll show you. Connie, what the devil is going on? CONNIE: You'll see! Good evening. SLOW MUSIC PLAYS Excuse me, may I? Thank you. Jolly good party. Splendid. No, thank you. I understand you're running for the new parliament, sir. Yes, they managed to bully me into it. Sounds an absolutely first-rate idea. Your daughter's looking very much better, sir. Yes, the doctors are very pleased with her. You seem very happy tonight. It's the night before Waterloo, didn't you know? The women dressed up in their finest clothes. The men danced gallantly. And in the morning, they march off to die. MUSIC STOPS What are you talking about? Put it on again. MAN: Excuse me, may I? MUSIC STARTS Can't seem to get drunk. You're different tonight. So are you. What were you talking about with my father? We were discussing the current political situation. Listen, I've got something to show you. - What is it? - Wait. Come on. CONNIE: It's all right, nobody saw us. Is this what you wanted to show me? Yes. This was my brother's room. Ah, yes. The war hero. He used to come up here to get away from everyone. We called it his retreat. And now... ..it can be yours. He loved books, paintings, that sort of thing. All these books were his. Do you like poetry? No. "I know that I shall meet my fate "somewhere among the clouds above. "Those that I fight, I do not hate. "Those that I guard, I do not love." Look, I can't keep this. He was so stupid, you know, in going off to fight. Even Father was against it. I'm sure he made a very poor soldier. You can't imagine what it was like here. Men queued all night to join up. All they ever talked about was the war. They seemed possessed with the idea that it would end before they got to the front. I just couldn't forgive him. Why not? Because he believed all that? Because he didn't! Don't you understand? It didn't mean anything to him. And he let it take him away. That's how I've seen that look before. What look? I don't know what it's called. It's a look soldiers have before a battle they don't believe in. It's the look on your face now. But you mustn't worry about it. No-one's angry with you. I'm sure whatever you're doing is right. I don't care what you think! What gives you the right to judge me?! Listen, there isn't going to be a battle. That's why we're here, to make sure nothing like that happens, to keep the peace. When will you people get that into your heads? SHOUTS: This is not a war! It may be wasteful and senseless and stupid, but it's not a war! Because if it was, my enemy would be a man in a uniform and a steel helmet, not a woman, or a child, or a shadow, or a noise in the darkness! If this was a war, there'd be honour, or courage, or pity, or... ..something! Not this. Not standing here, listening to you, you poor, sick girl! MERRYMAKING Down, put it down. CHEERING DOG BARKS Excuse me. BABY CRIES Rose, is it you? What are you doing here? What's happening? Go away home, miss. Just go away! BABY CRIES LOUD CLANGING DISTANT YELLING Let us through!

No broken bones, no bruises, no signs of concussion. So, she'll be all right. It's...difficult to say. You haven't eaten your food. Aren't you hungry? Don't you want your food? DOG BARKS That's all right, Anne. I can manage the rest. There you are, all nice and tidy. Shall I stay and talk to you? I'll tell you a secret if you like. Do you promise not to tell? Do you remember when I first came here? And your father told me about how you were daft in the head and would I be able to manage you? But I knew what he really wanted to know. I haven't lost my wits yet. So I told him. I said I was a Protestant. But I'm not. I'm a Fenian. Or a papish, or a taig, or any of those other names you like to call us. And if I had any choice, I'd rather be anywhere than in this house with a lot of stupid, ignorant Prods like you!

APPLAUSE SINGING CONTINUES Why won't you talk to me? Why are you so angry? I never thought it would get so bad, you know. Some rocks thrown. A few heads broken. A couple of deaths, perhaps. I accepted that. We all did. But I never dreamed all that ignorance and brutality would turn out to have a mind of its own. That it would follow me back here, through the door... ..up to this room. WINTOUR: We will administer this province with wisdom and with moderation... ..with fairness and with due regard for every faith and interest. CROWD CHEER MAN SHOUTS: No surrender! Ulster forever! There's nothing wrong with you at all, is there? It's all put on! Why won't you eat? I'll make you eat. SLAPPING CONTINUES MARCHING Lucky devil. How did you manage it? I didn't manage it, I was ordered. Anyway, you'll be going home soon. Only if the truce holds. More than likely, I'll be sent down south, bash the Shinners again. I shouldn't worry about it too much. They're about to start bashing each other, I suspect. Sorry to go at all? No. It's not my idea of soldiering. Well, you're out of it now. Yes... The station. I've changed my mind. You turn right here. I'll tell you where to go. I'm sorry I wasn't in when you called. I'm a busy man these days. So, you've seen her. She's changed a lot, I know. She's been very ill. But she's getting better, I'm sure of it. The doctors insist we treat her absolutely normally, pretend there's nothing wrong. It's a bit difficult, of course. One feels an awful brute. But it seems to be working. She still won't eat, of course. And how are you feeling this evening, Connie? The Army's leaving us, Connie. What do you think of that? We're going to have to look after ourselves from now on. The lieutenant has come to say goodbye. Will there be anything else, sir? What? Will there be anything else? No, no, thank you. - Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight. KEY RATTLES IN LOCK Don't be too long. She gets tired easily. Connie... Listen to me. They're saying you've lost your mind. I know that's not true. I found these. I felt as if every word was addressed to me. Everything that's been happening to me since I came here. You understood it all. But you're wrong about one thing, you know? All this isn't your fault. And it isn't mine. We didn't create this chaos. We inherited it. Connie, listen. I'll take you away from here. You'll get better. Then we can forget all about this terrible place. Look, it's not too late. Say something, Connie. You can speak to me. Don't you see what I'm offering you? Why won't you speak to me? Say something! I know how to make you speak. You don't think I can be as strong as you? Speak, for God's sake! 'My dear brother, 'I write for the last time, 'knowing you will never read these words. 'For too long, I have thought only of you. 'I thought my suffering filled the world. 'Now I see it only filled the rooms of this house. 'I'm beginning to understand 'what has been happening around me. 'I am beginning to understand 'the part that you and I have played in it. 'I do not know if I can bear it. 'One thought overwhelms me.
