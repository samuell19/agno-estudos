It's been hit like three times in the past month. What's going on? Let's call for back up. Dammit. 2-11 at King Arthur. Give me some back up, right away. Team of two, roger. [interposing voices] Freeze. Put your hands on the counter. Where are these guys coming from? Stop, police. [ominous music playing] [siren] Man, that was great. I'm all jacked up. Me too. You all right? Yeah. Fuck, did you see that last hit? Sent that guy flying. ALAN: That was great. Got it. Wait a minute. What time you have? Oh, man, I'm late. We got to go. [applause] Now what, tough guy? Bang, bang. OK. OK. So you've taken out three guys. There are two more left. Now, you're out of bullets. And here I come. All right, all right. I see you're missing the point. Got any more tricks? That's it, brother. See, if this had been a real sword, you'd've lost your. Ah, rats. When you threw me down, I lost my contact lens. I couldn't see that that was a wooden sword. Here. I'll-- I'll get it. I'll get it. How's that? See that was a sword technique, a takeaway. Here, you try. You try. You want me to do that? Yeah, you do it. All right. Wait, what am I doing? Just relax. Overhead strike. Catch the sword turn to the inside. Inside. All right. I got it. I got. Just let it flow. JOHNNY: All right. I got it. - Slowly. Yeah. No. See, you're still tensing up, trying to use all your strength. Just relax and let it flow. - Like water, right? - Exactly. JOHNNY: Water, OK. - Here we go. - All right. Slowly. ALAN: Slow. For me. OK. That's it. All right. See? Even a stronger opponent can be beaten if you use his strength against him. Thanks, partner. OK, everybody, as of tomorrow, my brother will be a full time instructor of our school. [applause] And that's how I finished them off. Let's get some coffee. Ready for your little early retirement, huh, Alan? Yeah. He'll be back. Hey, how you doing? What do you know? Hey, just between me and you, amigo, tell me you're not going to miss the rush. Yeah, I'll miss it. But I can live without it. Bullshit, man. You like as much as I do. True. But people don't look at cops like heroes anymore. And that's why I like working with the kids down at the martial arts school. At least they look up to me. Yeah, you go a point there. I wish you'd reconsider. I'm losing a hell of a partner. What are you doing? It's called martial arts, Frank. It's something you don't have to worry about, busting pimps and prostitutes. Problem is, Johnny, a bullet don't care if you know martial arts or not. Right, Dagger? Tell me about it when you learn how to shoot straight, Frank. Keep exercising. So there he is, his eyes as big as saucers, my snubby stuffed down his throat and I says to the punk, now, we can either do this the easy way or the nose way. Very funny. What do you say, Armand? Listen up. Major heat going down, Lawrence Gallery. Need all available back up now. Let's go. Well, ready for one more go round, cowboy? I don't know, Johnny. I don't feel right about it. I mean, it's my last night. Doesn't feel right. I understand. Never second guess yourself. Let's go. Let's go. Oh, shit. Hey, what'd I tell you about second guessing? Hey, there's only one thing you can never second guess, Johnny. - What's that? Being there for your partner. OK, partner. Let's go get the bad guys. Yee-haw. [rock music playing] Hey, check this out. Whoa. I'll bet that's what this is all about. What do you mean? Johnny. [mystical music playing] Oh my god. Where's your damn vest? Hang on, cowboy. You're gonna be all right. Johnny. JOHNNY: Alan. Alan. Alan. OK, I want you to pair off and try it for yourself. STUDENTS: Yes, ma'am. - Come on, Max. - No. I want to go home. I don't like this. What's going on, Max. This is stupid. I hate it. I'm sorry, Ms. Vicky. Why? You don't do anything wrong, Sarah. Gosh those are big tears. You must've been awfully afraid. I'm not afraid. Let me tell you a little secret. Sometimes it's OK to be afraid. Yeah, but you never are. That's because I practice very hard, every day. Now, come now. I want you to flip Sarah. MAX: I can't. Look, just imagine Sarah is as light as a feather and follow through, OK? OK. I did it. I did it. Here, man, Give me five. OK, that's it for tonight, class. Thank you very much. Johnny. [melancholic music playing] Ever since my mother's death when I was a kid, Alan and I were raised by different parents. But no matter how many miles separated us, he was always the closest thing to my heart. He died in the line of duty. He wanted you to have this. DRILL SERGEANT: Company, present. Halt. Ready. Fire. [gunshots] [jazz music playing] RUDY ANTHONY: Yeah, yeah. I can understand you fine. Just speak a little slower. I'm looking at it as we speak. I want $1 million, cash, non-negotiable and you can drive it home. Nevermind. It's an American expression. All right. Sayonara. Vince. I think I just left a couple mil on the table. This guy didn't even bat an eye. Yeah, boss? RUDY ANTHONY: I want you to pick up our Japanese friend at the airport. Take them over to my club. OK. And Vince, by the way, treat him like a million bucks. Don't I always? All right. [MUSIC - NICOLE ROSS, "CHEZ CLUB"] Mr. Yoshimo. Hi. Please, sit down. Are you hungry? Did you eat? No. Please, try some of this caviar. It's the finest in the world. Thank you. Honey, bring us another bottle of champagne. How's the caviar, Yoshima? Everything is beautiful. You have a very fine taste. Elegant, classy place. You butter me up too much, Yoshima, I'm going to feel you're making a steal. Oh, no, no, no, no. You appreciate beauty. Look at my man. Take off your clothes. Look how beautiful he is. See how powerful he is. Power's a beautiful thing, isn't it Yoshima? I'm only a business man. I don't know about those things. But what about your man? He doesn't seem impressed. [speaking japanese] I think we might have something here. [rock music playing] Now, smash him. [interposing voices] Get up. Don't feel bad, Yoshima. Like the caviar, he's the best that money can buy. Now, let's take care of the business. Right this way, Yoshima. Look at this view. Come on. Wow. Come on. Watch that first step. It's a doozy. All right. Look at [ominous music playing] It's all here for you. You can count it yourself. Smells like a million to me, Yoshimo. YOSHIMO: Yes. Yes, oh, wow. Yoshimo, your Sword of Honor. Mr. Anthony, a phone call. I'll be right there. Don't do anything. I'll Be right back. It's real. So is this. Wow, look at this. Look, I told you to go home. Why don't you just do what he says? I want to stay with you guys. Why don't you just go home? We're getting sick of you. But I want to stay with you guys. Look, if you don't go home, we're gonna throw you the trash can. No. No. No. So I ask him-- I ask him. What-- what else do you do? He said, I'm a song writer. What song writer? What-- what's that thing you do? [singing] (SINGING) I, I went over to my girl's house. A pleasure, I was seeking. I kissed her under the nose and that freaking thing was leaking. [inaudible] A little nicky knacky. A ching-a, chong-a cha. - That is beautiful. [interposing voices] You're my boy, Frankie. You're my boy, Frankie. You know the first time I meet Frankie. How about the first time I meet Richard? He comes to me. He's no-- you know. I said, I got a little job for you. There's a jeweler that's got a thing for pastrami sandwiches. Every day he goes to the deli. And when he's there, he's carrying a mil plus in stones in a black briefcase behind his seat. And the door's unlocked. Every day he goes there. So I tell Richard. He goes down there. He snatches the bag. Pretty soon, you know, half the Vegas police are chasing him, right? He ends up at my house. And he's bragging his ass off he's got the stones. I said, Richard, you know, that doesn't look like the briefcase. He opens up the black bag. He pulls our a pair of dirty shorts, a salami sandwich, and an electric toothbrush. I laughed my-- thought I'd die. You love telling that story, don't you, Rudy? Oh, come on, Richard. You don't mind if I bust your balls a little bit, do you? What's the big deal? By the way, boss, you don't mind me asking what Richie got for that toothbrush? JOHNNY: We're talking about a cop killer, Chief. I want this case. Look, Johnny, we're all in this shit together. And no one liked the way Alan went, especially me. I know that you and him were buddies. And I know that's your partner. But the last thing I need is a wild kamikaze running the streets. That's why I'm taking you off this job. You wanted to see us, chief? Yeah. You got to be kidding me. You can't do this to me, chief. This was my partner. This case is mine. You heard the chief, grasshopper. Take a vacation. You know what your problem is, Frank? You've been hanging out with too much scum. And it's starting to rub off. Back off, Johnny. People die. Get over it. Get over it? Get over it? What do you know about it? Hey, why don't you lighten up, babe? - You lighten up. - No, you lighten up. Just take it fucking easy. Take a break. [interposing voices] Hey, that's enough of this bullshit now. Now, get your asses out of here, before I take all your badges. [rock music playing] Well? What happened? What? I don't care what he says. I'm gonna do this alone. You're not alone. Vicky, I just lost my partner and my best friend. I'm not about to lose his sister. Johnny, you're gonna need help. No. God, my car. Johnny, look. What? My car. Let me handle this. Hey, get out of there. Yoo-hoo, it's the Lone Ranger. I'm trying to give you guys a break. So why don't you just split? Yo, what are you gonna do, cop, shoot me? You're right. You guys ain't worth the bullets. So I guess we're gonna have to do this the hard way. [rock music playing] Not bad. Thanks. You're welcome, partner. JOHNNY: Sword. Ancient. [inaudible] JOHNNY: Book. Book and a long sharp object. [speaking chinese] Does anyone here speaking English? [speaking chinese] You coming? What was that? [speaking chinese] Thank you. [speaking chinese] The Mongolian dynasty fell to a single Ming soldier bearing the Sword of Honor. It was believed that whoever had possession of the sword could never be defeated. Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Where you going? I'm going to do my job. Hang on a minute. Wait for me. For what? But we're partners. Vicky, you run the martial arts school. I'm a cop. You do your job and let me do mine. Don't tell me what to do. I'm not telling you what to do. I'm telling you what I'm going to do. Johnny. What? This is your house. Then, lock up when you leave. [rock music playing] Yo, hey. Get up. Get up. I'm clean, man. I'm telling you, I'm clean. Then, what's with the 100-yard dash? I just-- I don't know. I got scared, huh? Oh. Clean, AJ? Clean? Huh? This just happened to fall into your pocket? I'm telling you straight, this ain't even my coat. I just found it. Honest. No, come on. What can you give me on this sword thing? I don't know what you're talking about. I could put you back, eight by six so fast. I'm telling you straight, man. What I-- Shut up. Here's my number. Call me. You got it, man. I'm your friend. Yeah, right. Oh, jeez-- Do yourself a favor, stay away from this crack. Then, you won't have to second guess yourself again. AJ: Rolling 6's here. [interposing voices] Wha-- what was your name again? - Joe. - Joe. I got a buddy named Joe. Nice to see you. Joe, my wife, she's got my wallet. You don't mind spotting me one of these green ones. - Hey, what are you, crazy? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Get away from me. OK. OK. Just give me one of these red ones. Hey, I said get out of here. Hey, get out of my face. Will you get him out of my face? Whoa, what are you doing? Can't you see this man's trying to gamble? Whoo. When's the last time you took a bath? You're stinking up the place. Forget that, Nick. Listen, I'm here on business. We're not interested in your kind of business. No, but Richard will be. Listen, I got to speak to Richard. I got to speak to Richard right now. What makes you think he wants to see you? Would I be asking if I didn't have something for him? Kapoosh? [phone ringing] Yeah, Nick? AJ wants to see Richard? What's this all about? Send him over. Yeah, Nick? I'm gonna send the limo for him. Thanks, Nick. Bye-bye. Let's eat. [accordion music playing] What can I do for you, pal? I'm here to see Richie. We ain't got no Richie here. Come On. I'm AJ. AJ, come on over. Hold this. Hi, Richie, Mr. Rudy. Sit down. Thanks. Thanks. Have yourself some pizza. Oh, thanks. That's great. What are you doing? You're picking your nose. It's disgusting. Come on, what do you got for me? Well, listen. This undercover cop, he's been snooping around about the guy that popped the sword from the museum. So? What? I mean-- What's that got to do with me? Richie says, whenever the cops come snooping around to tell him, right Richie? Yeah. You know this cop? - Yeah. Yeah. I got him in my pocket. But I'm a little short on cash right now. Don't worry about that. I'll take care of you later. What's this cop's name? Right here. Tell him you'll meet him over at Cupid's hot dog stand tomorrow at noon. Cupid's hot dog stand? Tomorrow at noon? I could do that. Yeah, listen. This is Jim. Jim, yeah. I want to talk to Johnny. You should know, Richie, I'll tell you, I haven't eaten pizza like that in a long time. How about a little dessert? What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Yeah, so, Richie, where's the money, huh? What's your hurry, AJ? Oh, no hurry. I just thought maybe-- Here, have some more, huh? Yeah, sure. Oh, Richie, I really appreciate this. I mean, you-- you've come a long way since we was pinching nickels and dimes from them bootleggers. I mean, look at you. You're practically Rudy's right hand man. Remember how I always used to say some day I'd get my own piece of the action? You remember that, AJ? Yeah, I do. I remember that. How about another hit, huh? Yeah. But you know, sometimes you've got to leave the past behind when it's time to move forward. No strings. No ties. Nobody to remind you where you came from. And then, one day you wake up and life fits, like a brand new suit. Fits like a brand new suit. Richie I'm just-- I just want to get the money. Sure. I'll get your money. Good. Richie, how do I get it though? Like this. Richie. Hey, [inaudible],, now who do you want to see? Looks pretty clear cut, a couple of Japanese high rollers took a wrong turn and got rolled. Right, Dagger? - Yeah, looks that way. Anybody see anything? Nothing. So far all we've come up with is a bunch of dead ends. Well, dead end is right. Get the paperwork done. Turn it in. And let me know what's happening. That's it? Well, you got a problem Officer Lee? Yeah, I got a problem. What is it? Ballistics. FRANK: Ballistics? You got a suspect with a weapon? What about the bullet that killed my partner? Anybody think about checking for a match? He's right, Frank. Why don't you check with ballistics and let me know what's going on? Don't worry about it. I already checked it out. Well, that's the last thing you're taking care of, because you're still off this case. Yo, Vic, how's class? Oh, god, I don't know. I've got so much on my mind right now, you know? Yeah, I know what you mean. Listen, let me run something by you here. There was this case a couple years back about this artist who sold the same paintings to several different buyers. Sorry, I'm not with you. Well, he promised each buyer the same painting and collected up front money. OK. All right, suppose you had this priceless object, capable of attracting the richest buyers in the world. Why sell it just once? Yeah, but the sword's not like the painting. It's already finished. The investor would simply hand over the money and the deal would be completed. Assuming that the buyer lived. See what I mean? These Japanese guys-- Hey, you done with this? No, I got one more set. Thanks. You're done now. [rock music playing] Hey. Don't you know it's not polite to hit a woman? So where does it hurt? VICKY: Here. Where? VICKY: Here. - Here? - Yeah. Yeah, how does that feel? Ow. Oh. Oh. Cold. JOHNNY: Well, this is supposed to be cold. Yeah, but it's not supposed to hurt. JOHNNY: The pain will go away in a little while. Yeah, right, everybody needs to suffer. Well, you're a pretty amazing lady, you know that? How come you and I never got-- What? Involved? Yeah. Well, you were my partner's sister. VICKY: So? So I felt that it wasn't right. How do you feel now? [r&b music playing] Hey. Oh, Johnny, I've been looking for you. What do you got? In my opinion, these two bullets were fired from the same gun. Oh, David, you're beautiful, man. What y'all been smoking? I've never seen them bitches before. You tell us what you know about the stiffs in the dumpster and you got nothing to worry about. We don't know nothing about those stoops. We deal in live merchandise. Save it for the DA. I'm saving it for you, sugar. Oh, let's move it, girls. Hey, Frank, mugging, huh? Got a ballistics match. Yeah, Johnny? Got a ballistics match, Chief. I thought I told you to stay off this case. What the hell do you think you're doing? The bullet that killed my partner came from the same gun that was used on the so-called mugging victims. Looks like you're right. Our man's still in town. That's good work. Keep on top of it. Keep me informed on what's going on. You got it. Johnny, wait up. I have some messages for you. Thanks. You're welcome. [funky music playing] Have you seen a guy here, about 30-ish? Looks like a Ratso Rizzo? No. Yeah, figures. He's a no show. That'll be a buck and a half. [rock music playing] [siren] Hey, thanks for the back up. What's the matter, Johnny? You didn't like the dogs? No problem. Where you going? Thanks a lot, guys. What are you doing? Hey, wait a minute. This ain't our mess. Fuck you doing, man? Wait a minute. This fucking guy. Can you believe this guy? [MUSIC - DENNIS NAPOLITANO, "DANCE FOR ME BABY"] [speaking spanish] There's no more. [speaking spanish] Hey, sir, there's a cover charge. - I'm here for AJ. - He's not here. What's the matter with you? You got brain damage? [speaking spanish] It's no good. Tell him about the automatic weapons. [speaking spanish] Federal agent. Drop the fucking gun, man. ID. He's a cop. Nice work, bonehead. You just blew six months worth of undercover work. And now, we got two stiffs to show for it. Yeah, man. JOHNNY: Can't believe that little rat bastard set me up. What was I thinking? I had my head on backwards. I'm so fucking stupid. Are you done browbeating yourself? Because personally, I don't give a healthy shit about those feds. And another thing, do you think you're the only cop who ever got his tit caught in a ringer? Hell, we've all been through that shift. So what I want you to do is just go home, take a nice hot bath, relax, get a good night's sleep, and come back tomorrow. And you'll feel better. Now, get your ass out of here. Thanks, Chief. Now, get. Move. Get out. Dymitri's solid at $5 million. I don't know, Richard. What do you think? Think we ought to take it? $5 million? No wonder Yoshimo had such a hard on. I'm telling you, it's candy from a baby. It's a half a mil in your pocket. Not bad for a day's work, huh? What's going on with you? What's with the long face? I should've took care of that cop personally. Can't afford to have you exposed right now. He don't have nothing on us anyway. He bothers me. [phone ringing] Hello. I got a little problem I need you to take care. Why are you calling me? I told you don't ever call me at my home. I thought I made it clear that you are supposed to keep the heat off. I tried, but he's a good cop. What do you want me to do? We're gonna fatten up your bonus. But I need you to take care of this good cop. Listen, there are certain things that money can't buy. And this is one of those things. Now, don't ever call me. I'll call you. And I'll think about what this situation is and I'm going to handle it. Yeah, right. Chief's getting a little soft. He needs to think about it. Johnny? Hm? Something's troubling me. Well? Why didn't anybody else check for the ballistics match? What are you driving at? Don't you think the chief would want to investigate every possible connection to Alan's murder? The chief figured the killer wouldn't have been stupid enough to hang around with a priceless sword. Well, your chief must've been awfully surprised to find out otherwise. What are you driving at? Just watch your back. You know what? You think too much. You think too much. CHIEF WILSON: You heard me. I tried. It's not that simple. Goddammit, just get the job done and get the hell out of here. And don't come back. Look it-- I don't want to see your face again. Get. Move. Get out. [phone ringing] Let it ring. I told her not to call. Her? Who? Just kidding. Hello. Hey, Dino, what's up? Yeah. Got it. Tell the chief I'm on it. What are you doing? Something came up. Hot lead. Hang on a minute, I thought the chief told you to get some rest. Sorry, I got to go. But, hey-- Johnny, ha-- [ominous music playing] - Jesus. - Dino. Johnny. You scared the shit out of me. Just don't feel right. No shit. Where are these guys? I don't know. Either they're late or we're early. Stay here. I'm checking around back. You got it. Johnny, look out. [melancholy music playing] It should never have happened. [suspenseful music playing] What are you, crazy? [dramatic music playing] I'll be right with you. I have to give these to the chief. I'll be right back, baby. Don't be too long. Keep the coals burning. Everything all right? Dino's history. What happened? I don't know. But the cop's still out there. - What about-- Taken care of. Good. What about the cop? How many times do I have to tell you? You strike when the iron's hot. Forget about him. You're the boss. Hey, what does that mean? It means I don't like loose ends. When the deal's done, I'm taking him out. [blues music playing] Hey, anybody seen AJ? Oh, hey guys. Come on, let's go have another drink. Oh, the bar is back that way. Drinks on me. Oh, my friends. Come on, officer. You know we don't have any problems here. I remember you. I kicked you ass once and I could kick it again. You know I can't fight you. You're a cop. Oh, that's right. Hey, hey. I ain't no cop no more. Hit me. Come on. Hit me. That's all you got? Oh, I remember you too. Come on. Take his money. Drinks were on him, right? [interposing voices] [blues music playing] That's 60 cents. Must've left my wallet in my other pants. 60 cents or hit the road, pal. Hey, listen, I'm a cop. Give me a break, huh? When you boys in blue go undercover, you sure don't mess around, do you? My first husband was a cop. Am I gonna get a hot cup of coffee, or not? I'll be right with you. Just hold your horses. He looked so handsome in that blue suit and his boots so nice and shiny, so tall and proud. Man, he was a good looking dude, the way he'd come strutting up to my door. [ominous music playing] Hey, where are you going? You didn't finish your coffee. Hey, Frank, you seen this-- FRANK: What the hell happened to you? Hey, next time you take my car, put some gas in it. No problem. You seen this guy before? Well, what are you asking me for? You're the hot shot. It's Richard Sireno. Richard Sireno? Yeah, I busted him a few years back on some bullshit charge. Did a little time and when he got out, he left town. Well, he's back. And he's a cop killer. I need your help to get him. You need our help? This is our case. You guys can have the arrest. I just want to nail the bastard. Let's check it out. [melancholy music playing] You don't have to give me your answer now. You sure this is the place? Yeah. It's a long shot though. Let me ask you something? Why am I doing this for Johnny? Because we're gonna nail the guy who killed the chief. It doesn't make any sense. The chief is dead. Dino was dirty. You don't know who you can trust anymore. What are you looking at? Nothing. What? You think I'm dirty. I didn't say you were dirty. Well, you're looking at me like I was dirty. Or you think I was looking at you like you're dirty. Well, you got me thinking like I was dirty. Come to think of it, I don't know anything about you. What made you want to be a cop? I didn't. I wanted to be a singer. A singer. No kidding? Let's go. Come on. Damn. We'll get you some information now. Call for back up, right now. 216 to dispatch. We're pursuing the robbery suspects north bound on Industrial. Shit. Where'd they come from? Sireno's gonna be pissed if we don't get him his grenades. Vehicles are west bound on Hacienda. Shit! Give me your gun. I'm pulling up next to him, right now. Here they come. Here they come. Slow down. Slow down. Oh my god. Don't need any back up now. What does K-Mart and Michael Jackson have in common? What's that? They both got boy's shorts half off. You gonna deal or are we gonna sit here all night listening to his stupid jokes? What you in a hurry to lose your money? You gonna deal the cards or what? Relax. Relax. What are yo doing, stacking the deck, Nick? What do you expect me to do? I got to win my money back somehow. Excuse me, boss. There's somebody here to see you. - Get rid of them. - I tried. He won't go. Tony, take care of that. $50. JOHNNY: Hey, man, what's up? - Hey, what's up? What's happening? - Hey, nothing. Hey, so what's the problem? I ain't got no problem. Just want talk to Nick. - Is that right? Mhm. Nick don't want to talk to you right now. He's busy. Ah ha. Well, check it out, man. It's a personal thing. Now, I don't want your boss to be embarrassed in front of his friends. You know, what I'm saying? Well, unless you got a warrant, you just ain't gonna get see him, now are you? OK. That's cool. I'm out. - Fold. - I call. What do you got? Aces and 6's. Three 4's. Finally dealt myself a pot. Who the hell are you? Police. Need to ask you a couple questions. Yeah, what do you need to know? I'm looking for a bookie that used to work for you a couple years back. A lot of people used to work for me. Richard Sireno? Yeah, I remember him. What about him? I saw his face on a milk carton. You know where I can find him? Milk carton. Take that badge and stick it up your ass. You know, you're really something. You come in here, you bust up my party, you rough up my help. You're lucky I'm on a winning streak. I'm gonna give you what you want. But do me a favor. Next time, call first. [suspenseful music playing] Hi. What are you doing? Taking a bath? Mhm. Hm? How was your day? Fine. You have the candles lit, huh? Mhm. RICHARD SIRENO: Do you like the candles? You do? Uh huh. RICHARD SIRENO: I know you like the candles. You like the flames of the candles? Uh huh. RICHARD SIRENO: Flames are powerful, like the sun. A candle is like the sun. It's strong and powerful and hot. Tell me you like it. Did you miss me? If you missed me, kiss me. [creaking] When I was a little boy, candle wax burned me. But I didn't cry. Get out of my house. Who are you? I don't want you here. Where did you come from? Come here. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. Next shooter up. This your idea of some kind of joke? Ah, shit. I gave you what I know, OK? I guess you don't think I'm serious. You're serious. You're a serious mental case. You're gonna tell me where I can find Richard Sireno. I already did. I'll make it easy for you, Nick. You got three seconds to tell me where I can find him. Hey, go bother somebody else. Metz Club. [dance music playing] Let's just keep this nice and simple. Take me to Richard Sireno. OK. Got a guy with a gun headed in your direction. [dramatic music playing] Now, where is he? Rudy Anthony's. Thanks. [jazz music playing] Oh, my Russian friend. At last, we meet. Davai! I'm looking forward to spending some time with you, for a couple days. I love to come to America. The people are so deliciously decadent. It makes me want to eat. Are you hungry? Hungry? I am famished. Good. We're gonna make you comfortable. Frankie, take them to their rooms. And then, we'll eat. Come with me, my friend. [string quartet playing] Hey, boss, this guy's [inaudible].. Yeah, I know, Frankie. This guy's eating like a fucking pig. [inaudible] When am I going to see this wonderful sword. Soon, Dymitri. Soon. You know, only a sentimental fool such as myself would attach any historical significance to this priceless sword. This sword is solely responsible for the defeat the morale of the Mongolian troops and their ambitions to extend their territory into my country. That's a fascinating tale Dymitri. Fascinating. But don't eat too much now. We're-- we're gonna go out to dinner. Wonderful Wonderful. [chatter] Microwave huge for Soviet soldiers. See, they'd warm up their boots. This is wonderful. It's good. And Las Vegas, I love it. This is the best food I could get here. [inaudible] You come here-- you come here often, yes? I own it. He owns the place. This is very fortunate. Very fortunate. I'm glad you're enjoying it, Dymitri. I'm glad you're having fun. This Richard Sireno's been working for Rudy Anthony. Chances are we'll either find him at his estate or a restaurant. I suggest we split up. What do you think, Frank. Yeah, OK. Why don't you check out the restaurant? Dogger and I will check out the estate. Johnny, I was wrong what I said about losing your partner. Forget about it. I used to love Halloween when I was a kid in Detroit. It was about five or six, I discovered the secret to trick or treat. What is this trick or treat? Well, Dymitri, it's a-- it's a pagan scam invented by poor people. Let him continue. He's on a roll. Like I was saying, I discovered the secret to the whole program. When all the other kids were going house to house, knocking on doors, begging for candy, I'd wait behind the bush with one of my mother's kitchen knives. You know, the real big kind? After sticking that knife in a bunch of fat bags, I have more candy than any kid on the block. What an enchanting story. This is a man after my own heart. But I must tell you, all this talk of candy, I'm hungry again. We'll have a little dessert. We're gonna go to my house. We're gonna make a deal. And you'll be on your way. What the hell are you doing? You're eating all the cherries. Cherries jubilee, what a wonderful notion. That fat fuck was eating me out of house and home. How is it? It's beautiful. [ominous music playing] [speaking russian] Hey, [inaudible],, you're in America. Why don't you speak American? We give you American bullshit. You two guys are gonna do just fine. You two guys are gonna be all right. [ominous music playing] FRANK: What do you make of it? I don't know. It looks pretty quiet. Yeah, it does, doesn't it? Now, let's go check this out. [ominous music playing] Don't look to quiet no more. Flank to the left, flank to the right. Four more inside. FRANK: Wow. Who's the beautiful dame? She's gorgeous. Wait here. Where's Colorado? She's in the jacuzzi. Hey, where is my boss? They're on their way. It's Sireno. What the hell's going on? I came back to get you. Where's Rudy? He's dead. You with me or not? Yeah. Oh, shit. Get dressed. Frankie, clean this mess up. No problem. I'm gonna go get a couple of baggies. Let's go. I always knew it would be us. How'd you know? The way you always watched me. What'd you think? I liked it, a lot. [rock music playing] [gunshots] I got the sword, Sireno. I can't be defeated. It's only a legend, cop. Nice try, cop. Whole lot of tricks, huh, cop? Sorry about your partner, cop. Thanks, Dogger. It's you and me, cop. It's you and me. I'm gonna blow your head off, motherfucker. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What are you doing? Wait a minute. No, you wait a minute. I don't think you want to do this. Oh, yeah? Why not? Why don't you take a look in the suitcase? I think you'll like what you see. You know what? I already like what I see. Let's go. [suspenseful music playing] Dagger. Did you get him? Yeah, Dogger. We got him. How am I doing Ms. Vicky? Oh, I mean, Mrs. Lee. Good, Max. Real good.
