(dramatic electronic music) (birds chirping) (intense ambient music) (water trickling) (ice cream plops) - I... I didn't really have time to fix anything else. But, you know I... I was gonna bake a cake, but you know I guess ice cream goes with cake, right? I just wanna wish you guys happy anniversary. This is so goddamn stupid. God, I'm talking to fucking ghosts. I know I'm agoraphobic, Dr. Matthews, I'm not arguing with you there. (suspenseful orchestral music) (birds chirping) (knob rattling) (suspenseful electronic music) (heart thumping rapidly) (gasping) I tried it, Dr. Matthews, I really did. It just didn't work. I saw him. The man who attacked me. The man who killed my parents. I saw him, he was there. You don't know that. They never caught them. They're gonna find me. I know they're gonna find me. You know Chris, he just... He wasn't there. If he had been there, like he was supposed to be that night, then none of this would have ever happened. It was Christmas Eve and he was supposed to take the six o'clock flight. Mom and Dad and I and Danielle all... All went to the six o'clock church service. And when we were through we... We had to stop at my mom's office. She had forgotten something and Danielle had to use the bathroom. I waited out in the car and after 15 minutes no one had come back out. I walked in and... And that's when I saw it. It'd beaten my father with a baseball bat. He was still breathing and... And his face... His face was unrecognizable and if I didn't know any better I wouldn't even have known it was him. And they... They were undressing my mother and she was bleeding and I saw Danielle over in the corner. And she was crying. And, and she was bleeding and there was no wound coming out of her. And (sniffles) she was three years old. She was three. (sobbing) And she just kept crying. And that's when the other one came behind me and pushed me to the ground and... And I tried to fight them off but I couldn't and... (low whining) They... They had these tattoos on their wrists. These um, E shaped tattoos. And they all wore these masks. (muffled screaming) I haven't seen Danielle since that night. I can't have her living with me. I can't, Dr. Matthews, I just... I can't. I know it sounds stupid and selfish. But... I just... I don't... I don't need anymore reminders of that night. I don't. Every time I close my eyes I can see everything. It's just like it was happening, happening in front of my eyes again. The nightmares are just getting worse. I mean, they're almost developing into some sort of hallucination. I can see them. I can see them even when I'm not dreaming anymore. And I just think I'm going crazy. I'm going crazy. And there's nothing anyone can do about it. I know that they can't come back. But there's a part of me that keeps telling me that they will. Hey, Adair, how you doing? - Good, how are you? - Wanna get dinner tonight? - I can't. I have a workload a mile high since I've been sick. I'll take a rain check though. - You worry me. - And you worry me. How's Ryan doing? - You just have to see. Hey, man, you ready? - As ready as I'll ever be. - Come on, it'll be fine. Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine, okay? You know that right? - I guess. - You don't have to guess, I know as much. - I doubt that. - They're just as scared of you as you are of them. I mean, you're the new kid. - They all know me. It's not like I'm some complete stranger. - I know, I keep forgetting. Just try this. Just try this for me, okay? Listen, what do you think about Adair coming over tomorrow night for dinner? - I think that if, if that's what you wanna do there's not much I can do about it. Is there? - [Scott] Can I get a coffee? - [Chris] Nope. - Okay, I can take a hint. What's wrong? - How do you make something wrong, man? - No offense, but you look like hell. - Alright, I'm trying out a new diet of sorts. - Are you some kind of school girl? You anorexic? (laughs) - No. I went to the doctor. He said it'd make me feel better. My blood pressure's off the charts, man. - Yeah, next time he'll be telling you that heels will improve your posture also. - Yeah, I guess. But it's not really a diet. It's more like a resolution. I'm trying to cut all my vices. You should do it with me, man. We'd be like a vice fighting team. McNamara and Tyrell. - What kinda vice we talking about? - You know like sweets, coffee, smoking, drinking. (Scott groans) What? - You almost had me going there for a minute. - You're such a hedonist. - That's a problem? Oh and by the way, I need you to substitute for one of my classes today. - No. Not again. After that last time, it's not even substituting, it's like crowd control. - What are you talking about? - I mean, all you do is just sit in there and hand out papers to noisy kids. Plus, I gotta be on call for Ryan anyway. I mean, who knows how today's gonna go for him? - Apparently not very well. - Ryan, what are you doing in here? - You've got to get me out of here. You have got to get me out of here, Chris. - I got class in 20 minutes. We can't deal with this-- - No, you have got to get me out there-- - I can take over your next three classes. - Don't humor this guy. Come on. - They're talking clearly. - I'm free after lunch. I have free lunch. - They keep saying that I'm crazy. They keep talking about me. - [Chris] I don't have time for this. - Is he okay? - [Chris] Get out of here, you know you're not allowed in here. Get out! - [Ryan] Chris, don't do this to me. - [Chris] I don't want to, but I got to. Go back to class. - Is he going to be okay? - I don't know. (masked man laughing) (head thudding) - Ryan! Ryan are you alright? Ryan, listen. Can you hear me? Ryan! - Hey, are you awake? - What happened? - You passed out in the hall. You hit your head on your locker and you dropped some books. The office said it'd be best if I took you home. - Home? - You know I really wish you would have been able to stay for at least a day. I've got class in 10 minutes but I'll give you the key, you can let yourself in. (static buzzes) What is it now? - Out there, he was out there. - I'm getting sick of this. (spooky ambient music) (birds chirping) (dog barks) (dramatic orchestral music) (engine idling) - [Mr. Tierson] You can say that. (car door slamming) (voices chattering) (door slamming) - Good god, he's younger than I am. (sultry jazz music) (window banging) - Ryan! Ryan! Let me in. Ryan. Come on, just let me in. Ryan. Come on, Ryan. (doorbell ringing) Feeling better? - Brad, what are you doing here? - A loaf of bread. My mom had it left over from the lunch she got earlier. - Yeah? - Yeah, I figured I'd give it to you as a gift. - Thanks. - Not a problem. - You wanna come in? - Yeah. - Is this stuff home made? - Is what? - [Ryan] The bread. - [Brad] Probably not. She probably just bought it from the store somewhere. - Smells great. - [Brad] What does? - The bread. Geez, I thought I was out of it today. - Sorry, man. This has been a long day for me. Supposedly I plagiarized on an English test. Something like that. Not really sure. - Well, did you? - Who knows? You think you're not plagiarizing and then in this case I was. - You wanna piece? - No, I'm fine. I got supper later tonight. It's takeout. Surprise, right? - Suit yourself. - What about you? How you feeling? - What do you mean? - You passed out at school today. - I did? - Yeah, you don't remember? You were mumbling stuff. - Like what? - Couldn't make out what you were saying. Chris seemed pretty mad. - Oh my god, that's... I must be forgetting everything. I don't remember... I don't remember anything today. - Wow. I wish I had your memory. Man, then I'd actually have an excuse for something. - I went to school today? - Yeah. You did. I tried to help you up and you like, pushed me off. - And I didn't remember. - What are ya'll doing in here? You know Ryan hasn't been feeling real well, he supposed to be in bed. You understand don't you? I think it's best you leave now. - Take it easy, Chris. - Yeah, sure thing. - Well, thanks. - Go to your room. - What? - If you're sick, go to your room. - You know I'm not sick. - And gimme your phone. You can't have that phone, give it to me. You know what? I'd appreciate it if for once you didn't argue with me and just went to your room. - Well I just really appreciate it wouldn't throw my friends out like they're some sort of trash. It makes them feel really fucking awkward. - Okay. Well, why don't you stop being sick, and go to your room? It makes me feel awkward because I don't know what is going on here. What is going on with you? I can't keep nursing you like you're handicap. - Fine. - Just go to your room. I'm keeping your cell phone. - When someone walks out of a room that normally means the conversation is over. (door creaking) - Mr. Tierson. - Hello, Ryan. - Hello. - I know you just saw us last night. - What? - You know, me and my client. - The client? - Yes, my piano student. - Is that who that was? I, (laughs) I feel so stupid. - That's alright. You know what? If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to keep that between, you know, you and me. You understand, of course. My business is sort of under wraps. - [Ryan] Right. - You know how people in this town can be. - [Ryan] Yes, of course. - I enjoy my privacy, Ryan. I'm sure you enjoy yours. - Yes, yes. - You don't want anything to happen now would you? - I don't think so. - You're a lovely boy, Ryan. - Thank you. - Very lovely young man. The world needs more young men like you. - Thank you, Mr. Tierson. - You have a nice day. - You too. (door creaks) (lock clicking) Oh my god. - [Brad] What were they doing? - [Ryan] Nothing. He came over here freaking out telling me the boy was a piano student or something. - [Brad] A piano student? That guy doesn't even have a piano. I went over there a couple of years ago when I was in Boy Scouts, and I didn't see any piano unless he got one recently. Which I highly doubt. Probably didn't even know how to play it. Maybe he's one of those predators. - [Ryan] Predators? - [Brad] Yeah, like, you know, the pervy ones who has those websites. I bet he has a website. - [Ryan] Websites, really? - [Brad] Yeah. You've never? Come on. I'm sure he has a screen name we can find. My dad, that's how he got caught cheating on my mom. He didn't bother to change his damn screen name. It's worth a shot. - I don't know if I can make it this weekend, Grandma. Yeah, I'll try. I'll see what I can do. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye. What's going on, man? You eavesdropping on me or something? - I just wanted to show you this. - I really don't have time right now. I gotta write some things. They're kinda important. - What's going on? - Well, I'm afraid I have to leave. Just for a couple of days. - So you're leaving. Why? - Yeah, grandma's sick and she needs someone to come and take care of her. It'll be alright, dude. - Why aren't you more upset? You don't look upset. - I mean, I've gotta be the strong one. It's the only way I know how. - No you don't. - I do. - No you don't. (rain splashing) (thunder rumbling) (gentle knocking) Hello? Can I help you? - [Solicitor] Hello, I'm selling items for the Children of Jesus fundraiser. Do you mind if I come in and show you a few things? - Um... No, that's nice, but... - [Solicitor] It'll only take a second. - If you'd send me a brochure or some contact stuff I'd be more than happy to send you a check or something. - [Solicitor] Alright, but I'd hate for the information to get wet out here. Do you mind if I come in and dry off for just a little while? - Have you been walking in this stuff? - [Solicitor] Yes. - Are you alone? - [Solicitor] Yes, unfortunately. - Did you take a car? - [Solicitor] Yes, but it's parked around the block. You know gas is so expensive these days, well, there was no point in wasting it. I thought the exercise could do me good and then it started raining. - Look, I would let you in but my parents are asleep right now. Why don't you just put some contact information in the mailbox and I'll send you a check or something? - [Solicitor] You're parents aren't asleep, Ryan. They're dead. (dramatic orchestral music) - How did you know that? Who are you? - [Solicitor] Let me in and I'll explain everything. - Get away from my door. - [Solicitor] Let me in, Ryan. - Get away from my door, you sick fuck. I'm calling the police. (door rattling) - [Solicitor] Let me in you fucking bastard! Let me the fuck in! (door rattling) (dramatic orchestral music) (gasps) (rain splashing) (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Solicitor] Let me inside you. I wanna lick your sweet, tight hole. I want it. Let me have it. Your pink hole. It's mine. It's so warm and moist. I must feel it now. I'll have it sooner or later. (phone beeps) (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Killer] You shouldn't have hung up, Ryan. (dial tone hums) - Hey, Luigi. Yo, mother fucker. How you doing? You see anything, Luigi? (footsteps thumping) (bed creaking) Hello? Hello? Chris? Chris, are you back from the restaurant? (heavy thuds) - [Ghostly Voice] So pretty. So pretty. - Chris? Hello? (ghostly voice laughing) (phone ringing) (phone beeps) Hello. Chris? Thank god it's you. No, no, there's nothing wrong, no. So you're on you're way back? Okay, great. See you then. Okay, bye. (phone beeps) (Ryan sighs) Scaring yourself to death, kiddo. (dramatic orchestral music) (door creaking) (tarp rustling) (dishes clanging) (grunts) - I'm gonna do this. Let's see. This right here. (tarp rustles) (Chris screaming) (bones snapping) Oh shit! (dramatic orchestral music) (Chris groaning) (fists thudding) (Chris grunting) (globe shattering) (plastic crinkling) (flesh tearing) (killer whimpering) (dark electronic music) - [Killer] Pretty Ryan. So pretty. Pretty Ryan. (frantic knocking) - Ryan. Ryan, you look tired, man. - Thanks. It's 6:30 in the morning, Brad, this had better be good. - Of course it's gonna be good. Listen, forgot to tell you, tonight I'm having a party at my house. Huge party. - Awesome. - Can you make it? - I don't know. There's just... I just... I'm really tired. - Tired? Tired? You know what? You're probably tired because you sleep half the day. Come on, it'll do you some good. I live right across the street. I wanna just get out, live a little. Have a couple of drinks. Just relax, it'll be fun. Being social again, you know? Hang out with some normal people for a while. You need to get out. It's right across the street. - Sounds very mature and delightful but, I'll think about it. - Alright. What's that thing? - Come with me to the door. - Why, you expecting a visitor? - I think it's Mr. Tierson. - Oh, you're next door neighbor. Should we call the cops? Alert the church of elders? - I don't know just... Come on, alright? - Alright. Oh no, Mr. Tierson. Call the cops. - Hello, am I interrupting something? - [Brad] Not at all, man. - I saw that Brad was over here. I remember Chris told me that you're not supposed to have any guests. - Well, Brad's okay, Mr. Tierson. - You don't think we'll be getting into trouble at 6:30 in the morning do you? - Of course not. Chris still here? - Not that I know of. No, I think he left early in the morning. Like, 5:30-ish. - That's funny, his car's still out there. - It is? - Have a look. He's probably here. - Yeah, I guess you're right, Mr. Tierson. Well. - Have a good day, boys. - Thank you, Mr. Tierson. - Alright, will do, man. - I'm keeping a close eye on you. - That's always nice to know. - [Brad] Not too close. (phone ringing) - Yes, I'm trying to get ahold of Chris McNamara. He hasn't? Okay. When he does can you tell him to give me a call? I'm his brother Ryan McNamara. Thank you. Good bye. (fingers tapping) (water dripping) (dramatic orchestral music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Still no one there? - Oh no, no one's come over yet. I don't know why. They told me they'd be here at seven, or that it would start at seven, either way, I dunno. They're gonna be here soon I should hope. - Wanna just forget them and come over? - If no one's here in like the next hour or so, then I'll come over. Sound good? - Sounds fair. - Wait, wait, wait. By the way, you have that book The Turn of the Screw? - Yeah, I think so, why? - I need it to do for like, another English project. - Yeah, you know what? I think it's in the attic actually. How 'bout this? I'll go get it and when you come over I'll have it waiting for you. - Alright, man, I appreciate it. See you later. Bye. (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Mr. Tierson] Is Brad throwing a party? - What are you talking about? - [Mr. Tierson] Why do you need them, Ryan? - What? - [Mr. Tierson] Why do you need them? - Look, Mr. Tierson, don't you think it's about time you stopped this? Would it make you feel any better if I apologized for invading your privacy? - [Mr. Tierson] I'd feel better if you let me touch you. - Nice, Mr. Tierson. That's really classy. Why don't you get your sick, little, sexual innuendos harass you like I'm on a phone sex hotline right now? - [Mr. Tierson] Who needs the phone when you're so close to me already? - That close, are you? How close are you? - [Mr. Tierson] I'm so close I can almost touch you. - Well, Mr. Tierson, I can now officially say you missed your calling as a master of the erotic telephone arts. So if you don't mind, I'd just like to get to my evening. After all it was you who told me to respect everyone's privacy, wasn't it? So why don't you just go inside your room and jack off to some porn. - [Mr. Tierson] I'd rather be inside you. (phone beeps) - Nice. (metal tinkling) (birds chirping) (belt buckle clinking) (buckle rattling) (blade thudding) (flesh ripping) (fist thudding) (Mr. Tierson gurgling) (water streaming) (doorknob clicks) (door clicks) (water splashing) (suspenseful electronic music) (door creaking) (clicking footsteps) (dramatic electronic music) (frantic knocking) (doorknob rattling) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) (frantic knocking) Chris, pick up the damn phone this is an emergency. (phone ringing) For God's sake! (busy signal beeping) (phone beeps) (door rattling) (stairs creaking) (dramatic electronic music) (scissors thrusting) (killer screams) (scissors clanging) (eye bursting) (gasping) (screams) (knife thudding) (sobbing) (knife clatters) - [Killer] Ryan. Ryan. Ryan. - Please stop. My god, make it stop. Please, God, make it stop. - [Killer] Dreaming. (laughs) Dreaming. (laughs) (phone ringing) (phone beeps) - Hello. - [Killer] (laughs) You didn't think you were gonna get away, did you? (laughs) I can see you right now, Ryan. (laughs) - Please, what do you want? - [Killer] Make the sounds for me, Ryan. - What sounds? - [Killer] The fucking sounds. - No. - [Killer] Are you gonna make me come down there again, Ryan? Make them! - No, no. I can't do it. - [Killer] You're in no position to be saying what you'll be doing, Ryan. - Look, I can get you help. - [Killer] I don't need any goddamn help! I need you. Oh, all the things I'll do to you. You'll enjoy them, I promise. (laughs) I can almost taste you. Don't you want me to pleasure you, Ryan? Pleasure you like no one ever has? Make the sounds! Make them! - Please stop. - [Killer] You're mommy and daddy must have not been very cooperative either, Ryan. - How do you know about that? - [Killer] I know all your dirty secrets, Ryan. All your dirty secrets. - Please, I wanna help you. - [Killer] Oh, you wanna help me? - Yes. - [Killer] Then make the sounds. Make them. (Ryan moans) - I can't do it, I can't. - [Killer] Keep going you fucking cock tease! - Oh god. (moans) Oh god. - [Killer] Now take off your shirt. I wanna get a good look at you. Oh, you have such a nice body, Ryan. What would you be doing right now if my tongue was sliding down your body? (Killer slurps) Make the noises for me, Ryan. - I'm finished. - [Killer] It would be such a shame to stop now. How can ever pleasure you when I haven't seen your full body? - Please don't make me do this. - [Killer] Take them off, you goddamn whore, I wanna see everything. Do it! The boxers too. See, that wasn't so bad, was it? What a pretty cock. Turn around. I wanna see that ass. Now get on the ground. - What? - [Killer] I am I gonna have to repeat everything, Ryan? - Please can we just stop? - [Killer] No we can't. Now get on the ground. Good, now spread your cheeks apart. - No. - [Killer] Spread them apart, you fucking tease. Oh, you'd never know you'd been raped from the look of your hole. It's nice and pink like any boy's your age should be. (laughs) - You sick bastard, what do you want? - [Killer] I wanna eat your man cunt. Your pretty, pink man cunt. Then I wanna lick it. Lick it. Then I'ma stick my knife up your fucking ass and watch you bleed. I'm coming down there, then I'm gonna fuck your warm, moist hole until you bleed. Bleed. Bleed. (door creaking) - Ryan? I can't believe those fucking douchebags, man. They bailed out on me. Ryan! Ryan! I know you're here somewhere, man. (clothes rustling) (dramatic electronic music) - Brad, get out! Get out! - Alright, come on, man. If you're in there, this isn't funny. Come on. (knocks) Ryan, it's Brad. Just open it. (metal clanking) (Brad groaning) Shit. Oh, oh god! Shit! (gasps) (iron thudding) (skull cracking) (bones crunching) (Brad thuds) (zipper hissing) (water splashing) (sobbing) (fan whirring) (dramatic orchestral music) (door rattling) - Please. I did what you wanted, now just leave me alone. (dramatic orchestral music) Please. (Ryan screams) No, stop it! Stop it! Please, stop! Stop it! Stop it! No! No! Please! (door slams) (fist thuds) No! No! (mask thuds) (suspenseful electronic music) Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners. Now and at the hour of our death, amen. (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Killer] Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! (nails scraping) Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! (dramatic electronic music) (head slams) (dramatic orchestral music) (knife tapping) (ceiling rattling) (rapid clicking) Ryan! You better lock the bathroom door, Ryan. (dramatic electronic music) (door rattling) (knife scraping) (frantic knocking) (knife scraping) - Please stop. Please stop it. - [Killer] Let me in. (killer knocking) (water splashing) - Come to apologize? Wanna come back? (suspenseful orchestral music) (fork thrusts) (screams) (dramatic orchestral music) (clock ticking) (fork thumping) (flesh splitting) (Ryan moaning) (knife pounding) (water splashing) (dramatic electronic music) (door creaking) - I knew you'd come sooner or later. Oh, I get it. You wanna do it in the bedroom? You wanna hand me my towel? Alright. Here I am. Don't you wanna fuck me? (dramatic orchestral music) We leave. We leave after we're done. - [Killer] We leave after we've cum inside your ass. - I don't think that's gonna happen. (scissors pinching) (killer screams) (penis thuds) (sobbing softly) (glass shattering) (screams) (dramatic electronic music) (knife thudding) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (phone ringing) Hello. - [Killer] Shall we continue, Ryan? (dial tone hums) (laughing maniacally) (dramatic electronic music)
