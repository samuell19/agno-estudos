- Don't care if I never set eyes on this place. I've been trying to count how many times we moved. - I think it's seven. - I got nine. It's at least nine. - How many times is it, Mama? - I don't know. This time we got the law in. We ain't never had the law in it before. (birds chirping and cawing) - Stay in the wagon. - He's hurt? - Stay in the wagon. (men clamor onto wagon) (man yells at horses) (somber western music) - Go mule! Go mule! Get on there mule. Go mule! - Does that hurt? - Naw it don't hurt. - I'll wipe it before it dries. - I wash tonight. Leave me be. - [Voiceover] Maybe he's satisfied now. Maybe now he's gonna change. Maybe it's the last time. (fire crackles) - All right, back to it boys. This here's a trial, not a quilting bee. So let's proceed. - [Voiceover] All of 'em. Every last one of them, our enemy. - [Judge] Now what proof have you got? - I know he done it. - [Judge] But that's not proof. - Snoke's hog got into my corn. He didn't have the fence to hold it. I told him so and I warned him. The next time, I put the hog up and kept it. That evening a nigger come in. And he say Snope say to tell you that wood and hay can burn. And I said what? That's what he said to tell you, the nigger said. Wood and hay can burn. That night, my barn burned. I got the stock out but I lost my barn. - Where is the nigger, have you got him here? - Tell you he was a strange nigger, I don't know what become of him. - But that's not proof. Don't you see that's not proof. - Well get the boy! He knows. - [Judge] Come up here boy. (men whisper amongst themselves) - [Man In Crowd] He deserves it. - [Man In Crowd 2] I know what I would do if it were my boy. - What's your name boy? - [Sarty] Colonel Sartoris Snopes. - [Judge] Talk louder. - Colonel Sartoris Snopes. - Colonel Sartoris? I reckon anybody named for Colonel Sartoris, in this country can't help but tell the truth, can they? (light suspenseful music) - Now boy, do you know where your Pa was, the night Mr. Harris's barn burned? Do you want me to question this boy? - No damnation, get him outta here. - I can't find the gas can Snopes, but let me give you some advice. Leave this country and don't come back to it. - I aim to. I don't figure to stay in a country among people who cheat me. Ain't no Goddamn good anyway. - That'll do! Take you wagon and get out of this country before dark. Case dismissed. (men chattering) - Barn burner! (boys yelling and cheering fight on) - [Voiceover] This is the last time. I know it. We'll go away and start over. He'll stop now. I can feel it. (moderately paced western music) (chopping wood) (stick breaks) - Not much squirrel around here. - Where do you think we're going? (stick breaks) - I dunno, ask him. - Likely he raised to make another crop somewhere. Maybe even before, before he.., - That's not wood. - It's gonna be a cold one. - Don't you know by now he don't waste no fire. - There you are. You go get some more. (stick breaks) (birds chirping) - I'm going on now. - Where are you sleeping? - There's a place in the wagon. - [Pa] Sarty, come here. - You was fixin' to tell 'em, wasn't you? You would've told 'em. (punches) - Hm? Now wouldn't you? - Yes. - You're getting to be a man, you've got to learn. Stick to your own blood. Or you're not gonna have no blood stick to you. You reckon Harris, that judge, any men in there today would they all stick to you? Don't you know all they want is a chance to get at me? Because they knew I had them beat. - Yes, sir. - Man got to learn to take his own justice in this life. Ain't nobody willing to give it to him. That means knowing what to do, means knowing when to do it. No matter what a man has to do to set things right. Let's get on back, we can probably be there tomorrow. - Ho now! Hold it, hold that for me, will ya? (horse shoes) (humming) - * I have not problems of tomorrow * I started to make it on my own * I know I'm breathing worry * My heart is so broken you see * Oh Jesus the savior almighty - Whoa! - This is a big one. It's bigger than the other one. - Likely it ain't fit for a house. - Nevertheless, fit it will. And you'll hog and like it. Get off them box and help your mother. When they get unloading, take them on round the back and feed them. Come with me. - Me? - Abner? - I reckon I'll have a word with the man that aims to begin owning me tomorrow body and soul for the next eight months. - It's as big as a courthouse. I ain't never in my life seen anything like it. I bet it's like Colonel Sartoris's house. - [Voiceover] They're safe from him. He can't hurt them. He's no more to them than a buzzing wasp that'll sting a little, but that's all. Maybe he's gonna feel it too. (knocking) - Wipe your feet before you come in here. - Get out of my way. Hello? Hello, Miss Lula? Miss Lula? Miss Lula? Miss Lula? Hello? Hello Spain? Miss Lula? - What are you yelling about? - Miss Lula! - What is it? I know who you are. I recognize you. But my husband is not at home right now. So if you'll just wait at your house. Look at my rug! Look at it! Would you please go away? Will you please go? Major de Spain is not at home. I swear the rug is ruined. We brought this rug all the way from France. It's ruined. Why did you let that man in my house? I am having 20 people coming to my house tonight and you have let this man come in and ruin my rug! (scrapes boot) - Nice and pretty and white, ain't it? That's sweat that built that. Nigger sweat. Maybe it ain't white enough yet to suit him. He probably, he probably don't have enough niggers. He wants to mix in some nice white sweat with it. (moderately paced music) - Snopes? You here soiled my rug. I want you to clean it properly and return it to my house. Why the hell ain't you in the field anyway? - Oh I figure I start tomorrow. I don't ever move and start to work the same day. - Damn you, Snopes. - Lena and Donna Mae, come here. - What you want? - See this here rug? - 'Course I see it, what you think, I'm blind? - It come from Paris. - Want you all to take it round the back. Get a wash pot and boil some lye. Clean that dirt off. - I ain't never cleaned a rug before. - Y'all pick that rug up. - If I thought enough of a rug to have to get it all the way from France, I wouldn't keep it where folks coming in would have to tramp on it. - Abner, let me do it. - Get in the house and get supper. - [Voiceover] Blood's blood. You can't change it. I didn't choose it. He's right. Matter what, we've got to stick. 'Else we're nothing and we got nothing and no one. (scrubbing) - There, finished! - Scrub it some more. - My God, ain't it clean enough? (water splashes) - I could use some stove wood, Sarty. (scrubbing) (ax chops) (rock drops) - [Ma] Abner! Please. (scrubbing) - That was real good. First time we have rabbit in a long time. - [Donna Mae] When was the last time we had rabbit? - [Lena] Well I suppose we used to get a lot of rabbits. - [Donna Mae] Well when was that? - [Lena] I remember, it's when we still had that saddle. - [Donna Mae] I don't remember no saddle. - You don't remember nothing. - Do too. I remember when Mama's clock worked. - That was mom's hope chest. It ain't everyone who has a hope chest. - [Donna Mae] You ain't never gonna have a husband. (laughs) (door creaks) (fire crackles) - Sarty. Sarty. Catch the mule. Put the bridle reigns on him. (strumming guitar music) (drops rug) (dog barks) - [Miss Lula] What is it? - [Sarty] Come on, Pap. Hurry up. Get! - Whoa. (metal clanging) - Damn you Snopes. You must know that you have ruined my rug. And that rug cost me $100. You haven't had $100 in your whole cursed life. And you never will have $100. So I tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make you pay me an extra 20 bushels of corn out of your crop this year. I'm going down to my commissary and I'm gonna have a contract drawn up to that affect. And you come down and sign it. That's not gonna keep Mrs. de Spain happy, and it's not even gonna keep her quiet. But damn it, it might teach you to wipe your feet before you come in the house again. - You've done the best you could. If he wanted it done different why didn't he wait and tell you how? He won't get no 20 bushels. He won't get one. We'll gather it and hide it, I can watch it myself. - Did you put the cutter back in the straight stock like I told you to? - No sir. - Better go do it. - Yes sir. - Guess I should step off some more ground, cover them bushels. - We won't pay. - How we gonna keep it from him? - Ain't gonna pay him. I'm gonna take de Spain to court. - Get up! - Ya! - Ya! - Get up! - Get on there - Ya! Get up there! (chickens clucking) - We ain't gonna have to pay them no 20 bushels. A rich man like that Major de Spain don't need no 20 bushels of nothing. He lives in a fine, big house. I've seen it. I fix he just gonna forget them 20 bushels. We're gonna work hard and show him how we can farm. And then he's just gonna forget about ever asking for them 20 bushels. - Mind the mule. - [Voiceover] I could leave 'em. I coul run on and on and never see his face again. But I can't. - Where you going? - Fixing the mule up to plow. - Hitch him up to the wagon, we're going to town. - How come? We got work. - Do like I told you to do. (whistling) - Get up, get up. (whistles) get it, get it. (whistles) whoa! (men talking amongst themselves) - Would you take your hat off please? - [Man In Room] This man's trash and like he always has been trash. - He ain't done it. He ain't burnt nothing. - Get back in that wagon. - Burnt? Do I understand this rug was burnt too? - Any man here say it was? - Now, Mr. Snopes, you're bringing Mr. de Spain into court because you think that 20 bushels of corn is too high for the damage to the rug. - Man brought the rug to me and said he wanted the tracks washed out of it. I washed the tracks out and gave it back to him. - Hell if I'm a man. - I'll ask the questions... - You took my, he took my rug and ruined it. He... - I'll ask the questions. Now, de Spain says that you didn't carry the rug back to him in the same condition it was in before you made the tracks on it. Did you carry it back to him in the same condition? Well did you? I'm gonna have to find against you, Mr. Snopes. I'm gonna have to find that you are responsible for the injury to Major de Spain's rug. And hold you liable for it. But I do feel that 20 bushels of corn is a little high for a man of your circumstances. Major de Spain says the rug cost $100. So I figure that if he can stand a $95 loss on something he paid cash for, you can stand a $5 loss on something you haven't earned yet. October corn will be worth about 50 cents. I'm gonna find and I'm going to hold you in damages to Major de Spain in the amount of 10 bushels of corn, over and above your contract with him to be paid out of your crop at gathering time. (dark music) - Take that wagon round down to the Smiths's place, pull a wheel off of it. - He won't get no 10 bushels, Pap. He won't even get one. We'll hide every bit of tat corn that's ours. Don't you worry. - You reckon? We'll wait until October anyhow. (grinding) (horse neighs) (hammering) - This your first time around here? - Yeah I've been up in the northern part of state before. - Farms are small up there I hear. - Uh huh - Done well for yourself in the trial, Mr. Snopes. Don't you think he'd done well for himself, Blacksmith? - I think he done real well. To get ahead at all with a man like de Spain means you've done real good. - I notice you limp. - He was wounded in the war. - Oh, we have a hero with us. - He served under Colonel Sartoris. The cavalry. I was named after Colonel Sartoris. - The cavalry was it? - Yeah I horse traded after the war. - You see that horse de Spain was riding? Wonder what it costs. - I don't know what it costs but he might tell you what it's worth. Can't fool me about a horse or a mule. - Here you are, Mr. Snopes. - Much obliged. - The other tires will need tightening so you need to carry your wagon down to the pond and let it set for a while. - All right. (metal clanging) - Wait here, Sarty. - [Man Inside] So he was wounded under Colonel Sartoris. - [Blacksmith] That's what the boy says. [Man Inside] I know him from long ago. He served in the cavalry all right. Then he deserted and spent of the war stealing horses from both sides and sold them to anybody who'd pay for 'em. That's how he got that bullet wound. Running off with stolen horses. He's on his knees. - Come on with me. (light curious music) (paper crinkles) - Keep it. (clatter) - [Ma] Abner. Please. No not this time. (falls against wall) (suspenseful music) - Get that can of oil. - What are you gonna do? - Told you to get that cold oil can. - No sir. Please, don't! - Boy you better do like I told you. - Ain't you gonna even send a nigger? At least your sent a nigger last time! - I don't need no nigger this time. - Well let me go. Let me at least go warn him. Give him a chance to mend his ways. (door crashes open) - Hold him. Not you, hold him. Catch ahold of him. I wanna see you do it. Oh you gonna have to hold him better than that. If he gets lose, don't you know what he's gonna do? He's gonna go up yonder. Guess I better tie him up. - I'll hold him. - See that you do. - Let me go. I don't want to have to hit you. - Let him go. Before God, I'll go up there myself if he don't. - Don't you see, I can't. Sarty, Sarty! Help me, Lizzie! Sarty! (rhythmic music) (dog barking) - [Sarty] De Spain, de Spain! De Spain. - [de Spain] What is it? - [Sarty] The barn! - The barn? - [Sarty] The barn! - Catch that boy, James. Quick catch him. (energetic music) - Pap! Pap! (fire roars) Father! Father! (fire crackles) (panting) - [Man In The Distance] Yah, yah!
