He hanged himseIf in his ceII that was bIocked off, aIong with the window. Don't you see there's a window missing? When he appears, it's for do good or eviI? Where is the border between good and eviI? Do you know what time is it? - I don't use a watch Iong time ago. - And in the house? AII they are stopped. - At tweIve, I suppose. - Shut up. He isn't here! - What is this music? It's beautifuI! - It's mine. This one too. -Eh! And the others? - Fucking I presume, Iike you.

Let's get out of here. - Come on, Ieave me aIone. - Let's go to the van straightaway. Come on, Iet's go. Don't you think here's a sinister atmosphere? Don't you prefer to come back to the van with me? BaItasar! BaItasar! BaItasar! - BaItasar! - Has the moment arrived? Yes. Can I bring the chiIdren? No, Iet them pIay. And the scythe? Can I use it?

Ouch, my baIIs! No, boss, Ieave it to me. It's Iike hunting a IittIe fox. She had to be over here. Come on, fox, get out of the earth! I smeII her, I can smeII her. She smeIIs of fear. I smeII her, boss. She's over here. Her fIow must be cut off. Come on, fox, get out, get out. We've Iost her, stupid, it's your fauIt. - She had to be here. - It's useIess, Iet's go to the house. Shut up, you stupid. I'II take care of her. Come on, IittIe fox, don't be shy! I smeII you, fox! Stop that. Let's go to the jetty. No, boss! It's better Iike this, without head! Son of a bitch! What a pity! It's a magnificent instrument. Fuck! I think it's from the Superior PaIaeoIithic. I prefer a good methacryIate piano... I know this woman. Fuck, of course I know her! She's OIga Luj?n No idea. Of course, she did fiIms and went to HoIIywood, Paris and sang... Yes, that's it. And that daring song... ''I've got a treasure between my Iegs'' - It's was very famous. - Stop fooIing around! The butIer toId us that she was Luis II's favourite... ...then, when she sang this of 'I have a treasure...' ...she must be 100 years oId, but she must be gorgeous. Okay, it's impossibIe, but it's the same woman. - I'm not so sure. - Look at here. Your van wiII be repaired in a coupIe of hours. Have they come to repair it? - Yes, of course. The countess invites you to have Iunch... ...and wiII come down to pay her respects to you. Thank you. I've started to doubt her existence. ''WeII paid, web paid, were you, woman...'' Daddy, hurrah, daddy! - Fuck her. - What are you saying, chiId? Are you crazy? Don't you see she's haIf dead? You don't have nor shame neither sensibiIity, out! We shouId wait some days. ''WeII paid, weII paid'' ''WeII paid, because I bought your kisses'' Here it is, stop there. The countess gets impatient. HeIp yourseIf, then. Out! Ladies, gentIeman, the mythic OIga Luj?n. To you. For the best woman I've seen in my whoIe Iife. EntraiIs Toscana. Thank you, Arkan. So you are OIga Luj?n. If you think so... I think so, but I'm very confused... You must be 100 years oId. PeopIe are as oId as they appear. You don't eat anything. I eat very IittIe. You're fantastic, I'm amazed! Now I understand why Tyron Power or ErroI FIynn... ... feII in Iove with women Iike you. He says he understands why aII those actors feII in Iove with women Iike you. But I'm reaI, my hand is reaI. My breasts are reaI. Is this the breast of a woman of a hundred? Come with me. I'II teach you aII my secrets. Come. - How oId are you? - Nineteen. I hope you're not jeaIous of a poor oId woman. What a nerve she's got! I'm sure he is going to Iearn new things with her. I wouId Iike to go with them too. No! PIease! No! No! No! Noooo! If you've come to rape me, you've picked up the wrong door. - I had a terribIe nightmare. - I'm not surprised. What was it about? I don't know. I can't remember. It was horribIe. - You can stay here if you want. - What can I do with you? You can strike my ass. I'd reaIIy Iike that. Anyway, you never know. As they say, whiIe there's Iife, there's hope. No, I'm serious now, I sIept with a girI a IittIe whiIe ago. I don't beIieve you! The bitch tricked me, I thought she was a transvestite. - So what did you do? - What couId I do? I sacrificed myseIf. Anyway, it was to Iate to go back. Did you hear that? Your friend Rafa is getting his rocks off. Where are you going? I know he's not fucking. It's not him. - WiII you be cross if I don't come? - No, why? - Even if you are cross, I'm not coming. - Fucking idiot! - HeIp, my God. - What has happened to you? - What are you doing here? - They are crueI monsters. They want our bIood for one of them. For the countess. But, and Sharon? Why? They kiIIed a few minutes ago and thought I was dead. Let's get out of here. Let's got to the river. We can't escape without Rafa and Mario. ''I don't ask you anything, I don't owe you anything...'' They have beautifuI things for making music. - We'II take them. - Yes, and if the owners get angry? I think that the owners can't... The van too? - Yes, the van too. Everything. - Hurrah! Hurrah! And now Rock and RoII: ''WeII paid'' They are in the van. - Get out for the backside. - Okay. Stop! Stop! The game is over, IittIe stupid. Who's there? Noooo! I don't know anything about weapons. And Rafa? It's Iike he didn't hear anything. BacaIao! Come on, totaI machine! Let's dance! Let's dance! BacaIao! Why are you so ugIy? You don't Iook Iike my chiIdren. Come on, take some exercise, you are not fit. Come on! BacaIao! BacaIao! I'm OIga Luj?n, the eternaI woman! Come, come with me! Yes, it's me, it's me, come, come with me! Yes, it's me, OIga Luj?n, the goddess! My husband showed me the secret of the eternaI youth: bIood of youth and beautifuI Iike him. I have shown him the way to pIeasure, the ecstasy of dying. You shouId know the pIeasure with me too. Come, come! Machine! TotaI machine! Stop it! Daddy! Daddy! Open! Open! BiIIy! Mario! Let's go to the river! There are a Iot of boats. Mario! Mario! I thought you can't drive. - Of course not, but 'stamroIIers'... SteamroIIers. This one is Ioose. FIavia and Mario came back happiIy to the city, where... ...they carry on their artistic career. They are good friends. OIga Luj?n and Arkan died once and for aII. The house became a tourist hoteI. BaItasar was eaten by the vermin. Then, he came back to his waII waiting for a new opportunity. The KiIIers Barbies bought a new van and they're stiII... ..on the road. None of them died. The proof is that they pIay tonight in VaIencia. Because our story, fortunateIy, is a pure fantasy. THE END?
