Isn't it too early? Arabian Jasmine blooming at this time of year. It's crazy! They're saying a bunch of nonsense about us, Grandpa. Yeah, I'd say now they're really exaggerating. What does our family have to do... with the accident involving that vagabond Fabrizio? Can you tell me? What do I know? Ask them. Your job was to take care of the press. Did you? - Sure I did. - If you had done it right... You know those reporters. They make everything up! Why are you always dragging Raffaele into this? What do you think, Costanza? I'd say we have to make a choice, daddy. One way or another, a firm attitude must be taken immediately. And we shouldn't get a lawyer? I don't want to upset you, but my opinion is we have to find a good attorney. - And then we wait. - Isn't that a bit too much? Let's implicitly admit at least to have doubts about Fabrizio. No, definitely not. I mean, Fabrizio could do that on his own. But who knows what kind of idiot he'd hire to represent him. No, in a moment like this we need a top-class attorney. Who knows what the Judge thinks about this whole matter. Incidents like this... ...they can happen during hunting. There's a thousand examples. And Fabrizio is a terrible shot, thank God. This Judge Marino, isn't he related to those chocolate factory owners? Cecilia, what nonsense... What does that matter? Don't forget Fabrizio is in trouble. Okay, I'll take care of it. We don't have to discuss it any further. I'm sorry, Piero, but do you think... - You really think Fabrizio wanted to... - What? It's a thousand to one probability that Fabrizio wanted to... how do I say it? Wanted to kill Valeria? You're so brusque. I didn't mean to say that. Maybe not, but my answer is still the same. I don't know. And nobody else knows either. For now. It's better we not ask such questions. They sound like answers. - I was right, sir. It's exactly 21 meters. - Okay. Hand me the gun, officer. Hold this, Terenzi. So you use the silencer because of the crows? In case you miss, the other birds don't get scared, right? Of course, you have the telescope to help you with your aim... Would you show me, please? - Wait... - Let me go, Vittorio. - Fabrizio... calm down... - Please do something, Vittorio! There's nothing we can do. Come. - Come here, come to Lavinia. - Valeria... Valeria... Valeria... What a shame. Please give a sedative to Fabrizio. Drink up, Fabrizio. Take this. Small gulps, okay? Tell Dr. Cerri to go to the ward. I'll accompany Fabrizio. Come on. We're going home. Look, Fabrizio... you know I'm your friend, but sometimes... There are technicalities one must respect. Especially in my profession. What I'm saying is we have to notify the authorities. You understand that, right? Go on. Pick up the gun, Dugoni. I'm sorry, but I have to ask you to do it again. - I have to start over? - Please. Whenever you wish. That's enough. We can leave now. More, more... Okay, that's it. It will dry off in five minutes. Valeria... Valeria... You're hurting me! These ducks... Maria Teresa couldn't tolerate them. Why are you speaking of Maria Teresa right now? I phoned her last night and told her to come over. - You didn't tell me. - Are you mad? No, of course not. When I first met you, I thought Maria Teresa was your sister. She's my cousin. Us Sangermanos all look alike. When we went to that restaurant in Portoferraio... She was clinging to you all the time. I immediately thought she was your incestuous sister. - Who? Maria Teresa? - Of course. She looked at me in such a strange way... And she was right. Because I was interested in you. Besides... I was a stranger. Even worse... a little girl from the province. - "My girl from Lyon", that's how I called you. - Really? Don't you remember? You always remember everything. Damn, it's 4 o'clock already. I have a meeting with the estate manager. Oh, the meetings... sometimes it's more important to make love. I'm sorry, Anna, but I'm not going back. - Hey, Fabrizio! How are you? - Good evening. - Hi, Valeria. - Ciao. - What are you doing here? - We were passing through and had an idea. Actually, the best idea ever... I don't know which idiot thought of it. To eat a roast turkey here in this desolate land. - Do you know Vittorio? - Yeah, we know each other. You're a good friend of Fabrizio, right? - Why don't we go to the circus afterward? - Sure. - Is it far? - No, just 200 meters after the tollbooth. But I don't live around here. What if we're late? Don't worry, you can all come sleep over at our house. What do you say, Fabrizio? One sleeps well in the countryside. I'd sleep even better, but a rooster woke me up at 6... - It wasn't a rooster, it was an upland goose. - Idiot! Why don't you spend an entire weekend here with us? It's wonderful here this time of year. I'm counting on you, Anna. - Of course. Why don't we stay, Piero? - Sure. Why not? Springtime at this place is beautiful. I wouldn't change it for anything else. Not even with Vercelli? So it's a deal then? You come meet us here at our prison. Besides, isn't visiting prisoners an act of mercy? - Such pretty cows! - But the smell is terrible. It smells like dung. I mean it smells like shit. Sorry. They have to eat. Watch. You're lucky he didn't infect you with his obsession with cows, Valeria. Enjoy your meal. Don't worry, I'm not sleeping. No... please. You're strange. I understand Valeria's death upset you... but you shouldn't think about it. Such things happen to married people. If I stayed with my wife, who knows what would happen to me? - Vittorio... - Yes? What is it? Nothing... I just wanted to say 'good night. ' Good night. You treated me as an outsider from the get-go... And you never stopped thinking of me that way. All of you! We never stopped... for three years? Because you've been married for 3 years. Or am I wrong? - Spare me your irony. - It's not an irony. My feet are firm on the ground. I'm one of the few in our family like that. That's why you should believe me when I tell you no one sees you as an outsider. Maybe they did at the beginning. Fabrizio being caught in a summer passion. At Ferragosto of all places! - You have to admit it was almost... - Admit what? You think Fabrizio got trapped by the first girl who took him to bed? Is that what you think? According to you, I married him for the profit. One can make a mistake when counting his profits. I'm not saying you did it. What attracted me to him was his generosity. He's the only one in this family who knows the meaning of the word. He's sensitive, vulnerable... But you... you never did anything to help him. What are you talking about? He had all the chances! The jobs our grandpa is running, the bank, the plant... All Fabrizio had to do was choose. Choose what? Where to get buried quickly? Inside the bank? Inside the factory? You wanted to throw him inside your world without poetry, without fantasy. But you didn't succeed. He got away. - He's not like you. - That's what you say. Of course I say so! He has all the qualities to become someone. Someone worthy! And how will he do that? By stuffing the birds? Don't pretend you don't understand, Piero. You turned your back on him. So he ran off to the countryside. And you'll die there. That's not true! I love the countryside. I'll never leave. Then it's your fault. I'm sorry, but when he married you, he said he wanted to conquer a new world... ...outside of the family. So I guess he turned his back on us. And what's the end result? You two living in seclusion. And now you come and tell me he's unhappy. But he's not. I never said that! But... sometimes... he seems restless... As if he's looking for a way out, for a truth I never knew. - Not even you? - For example, his research on crossbreeding. You see, he's doing amazing experiments with animals. Let's try and be serious, Valeria. How can you think we're interested in cows? Valeria! Has anyone notified her cousins in Lyon? I took care of it. They'll come tomorrow. - I'll call Maria Teresa tonight. - What does Maria Teresa have to do with it? Sure she does! Her husband is the Bar attorney. Maybe... maybe if the Bishop talked to the investigating judge... Maybe then he'd better understand what kind of people he's dealing with. - But, mom... - Don't tell me it wouldn't matter. It still matters, thank God. I am happy to have foreseen the conclusions of our meeting. And I believe I made the right choice when I told attorney Bellini... ...asking him to take care of this matter. I did it even before hearing your opinion. Because I was certain of the conclusions. Officially, Piero, you'll be the one consulting him. This is his address. Do it immediately. As for the necessity to move quickly... I believe we're all in agreement on that. Anyway, I will call Maria Teresa. Marcello is an authoritative man. I wouldn't underestimate his intervention. Don't you agree? - Costanza telephoned me. - What did she want? It seems Judge Marino wants to charge Fabrizio... ...with voluntary manslaughter. They'd like for you to intervene with the Bar. They never cared about them... They always loathed both Valeria and Fabrizio. And now that this deplorable marriage is finished... ...by the hand of that wimp Fabrizio, no less... I'm sure it was an accident, Marcello. It couldn't be something else. Sure, sure... there are thousands of ways to get rid of a wife. And why should he get rid of Valeria? They were so happy together. Resorting to murder is idiotic. But then again, Fabrizio is an idiot. But you're not. On the contrary. That's why you couldn't kill me. You know how much it costs me to ask you for a favor. What do I tell Costanza when she calls me back? Don't promise her anything. I'll check it out and let you know. Actually, tell her you didn't speak to me about it yet. I'm going out. Armida? You can clear the table. Excuse me, Miss... Oh, I'm sorry, I meant Mrs. You see, it's difficult for me to get used to it. You're still young kids to me. - Oh, what a mess... - For once, don't worry about it, Cesira. You can clean it up later, when we're gone. - Do you need anything? - No, nothing. - Cesira? - Yes, Ma'am? How does my husband look? Oh, he's such a fine-looking man. I'll at least go clean up over there, okay? - Maybe there's too much confusion... - Ah, yes... All those people. You know how these ceremonies are. But it all went well. Maria Teresa was truly beautiful. - You're right. - Okay, this is where I leave. Good luck. You know how much I care about my cousin. - Don't worry. - Bye, Marcello. Oh, it's you, sir... I'll be leaving now, Ma'am. I'm a bit late. - Goodbye. - Thank you. I have to change again. I'll never be able to get ready before you. You'll see how many times you'll have to wait for me... I'll always wait for you. All the time it takes. Delaying the pleasure is a libertine art. Did you know what? No. I don't know much about these things... But I think you delayed more than enough. If I wait a bit longer, I'll become a spinster. I have to tell you something. - Right now? - Yes, I must tell you something, Maria Teresa. I didn't tell you about it before because... I hope it's nothing serious? The simplest of things seem to be the most complicated. You see... it's a temporary situation... I hope you don't think I'm so reckless to sacrifice a woman so much? I don't think anything, I... I just don't get it. If I didn't fear losing you... I would have waited to get cured before marrying you. I have been visiting a neurologist for a year now. It wasn't such a quick thing like it seemed at first, unfortunately. They're passing nervous disturbances... You only have to be patient a bit. That's all. You understand what I'm saying? I knew that you were... you are a superior woman... That's why I want to tell you I love you even more now... If that's even possible. Do you trust me? You see, I know about this stuff, being a divorce attorney. Come on, hurry up or we'll be late. Maria Teresa? Aren't you coming to take a shower? Can you hear me? Hurry up! Come on! Take off your clothes. What are you waiting for? Come on! What is it? Are you ashamed of your husband? Oh, come on. Get in. There you go. Here. Soap my back. Stronger! Stronger! Don't do it like a little girl. Harder! Harder! Don't be afraid. You know... now that I see you like this... you're really beautiful. Come on, stronger! Are you finished? Go on... Not too good... Oh, well... Why don't you ever put your stuff back in its place? Are you coming with me to the stables? No? This year I'll send someone to the Cremona fair. Is that okay with you, Mr. Fabrizio? Our old Patrick is always in good form, eh? He never misses a beat. I wanted to try with Patrick, because with artificial insemination... ...I couldn't impregnate her. You're deluding yourself, Morese. Sooner or later, that cow will end up in the slaughterhouse. She's condemned. From the day you got married till today? Nothing? And you sit there like a good, obedient wife? You never talked about it? - I was ashamed. - Would that be the end of the world? I understand he won't talk about it. What could he possibly say? - Have you discussed it amongst yourselves? - No, never. It's just not the right time. - He's not doing it on purpose? - No, no, Marcello is always nice with me. It's inconceivable! And you with your kind manners... - Please, don't yell. - Why shouldn't I? You're not a little girl anymore! We're talking about your life! How many lives do you think you have? Two? I guess you have two lives, so you can throw one away like an idiot! Yeah, you're right. But this marriage didn't really depend on me. I went out with Marcello a dozen times and we immediately got engaged. I was more flattered than I was in love. It seemed abnormal to me to say 'No' at the age of 21. - And my mother liked him a lot. - Your mother liked him, sure. Of course we live in Italy where mother is everything... But these aren't the Middle Ages! You're completely insane! No, not that insane, Valeria. When I found myself in Marcello's arms... Yes, I was prepared to endure everything. I didn't expect great things. And it's a short road from this to nothing, I assure you. You don't convince me. Then what is marriage about? Why don't you tell me? I don’t now, but I'm certain this isn't it. It's always a disgrace... It's another kind of disgrace. If one goes off to war, it's absurd that he die of cancer. And what if my frigidity is the key to everything? Ah... I expected that! The guilt complex! What's going through your head? You want me to tell you about Molteni? Am I wrong or do you like that? Or at least you liked it? I bet he'd make your frigidity go away. - You really like going hunting? - No, not that much. I always get sleepy after eating... But when there's a guest, it's a problem... So I go outside and I'm not sleepy anymore. - Okay, then let's go out. - That's a good idea. Okay, I'll go see the kids. No, please, Valeria, come with us. Don't leave me alone with him. - Okay. - Cover up. It's cold. Let's go. Vittorio? - This is Purdey Caliber 20? - You like it? - It's beautiful. - Treat it with care. - I'll go get the car. - Okay. Here I am. - Split up. We'll meet at the end of the woods. - Okay. I'll go this way. - Then I'll go straight ahead. - Ciao. Christ! Have you gone mad? You almost killed me! What were you thinking? You imbecile! They ought to lock you up! I'm sorry, Vittorio. After all, I'm still alive, Valeria. I think you two got scared more than I did. - I'm sorry. - Don't think of it. Fabrizio... come and take it. Put it on the record, Terenzi. So, Doctor, you exclude the fact... That this was voluntary manslaughter? Yes. As a hunter, Fabrizio is a disaster. You've seen it yourself. Then why does he go hunting? People do things like that, without any real reason behind it. - Especially someone like Fabrizio. - What do you mean by that? - Fabrizio is a peculiar person. - Peculiar in what way? You mean to say that he's... mentally fragile? Fabrizio had a very difficult childhood... He lost both his parents when he was only 6 years old. You understand, in such circumstances... - And his wife liked hunting? - In a certain sense... She lived out in the countryside. That's what you do out there. Please be more clear. - So Mrs. Sangermano was a conformist? . Yes. - And ambitious? - Both. But maybe she wasn't aware of it. And she imposed a way of life on her husband which he didn't...? No, no... She didn't have to impose anything. Fabrizio did whatever Valeria wanted. - Hold on a minute, Terenzi. - Sure. Are you aware what one might conclude from what you just said? What do you find so serious in my statement? In essence, you're saying Mr. Sangermano was under his wife's thumb. That's already a plausible motive for murder. Or one could make a hypothesis that Mrs. Sangermano herself... ...had ordered her husband to kill her. Suicide by Fabrizio's hand? Let's stop kidding around. Valeria enjoyed her life. I didn't think a judge... ...could be more imaginative than a psychoanalyst. Well, now you know! It's our job to look at all the possibilities! Anyhow, my opinion is it was an accident. A pure and simple accident. Do you think Mrs. Sangermano had relations with other men? - Absolutely. - Absolutely yes or no? Absolutely no. It's impossible, people would know. Valeria wanted to be judged well and in the most obvious way. Look, Marcello, we can't go on like this anymore. Let's separate and cancel this mistake. - What are you saying? - You heard me. You want us to be the talk of the town? So I should support this situations for fear of gossip? Ah, because it's all about supporting for you. Right. But we're not a couple. We don't live like husband and wife. - But I love you. - No... Yes, maybe you do. You love me in your own way, but that's not enough for a woman. You talked about it with someone, eh? So you got the idea to ruin me! Or someone put that idea in your head! Ruin you? And what about me? You didn't ruin me? Why did you marry me?! Why?! Only you know the miseries of my life. Is it so strange that I don't want to lose you? Stop it! Don't act like this, it's ridiculous. You don't have an ounce of dignity. No, no! Not with you! Because I love you. Stop it, I beg you... This condition of mine, even though you accuse me as if it's my fault... ...this happens to those who love too much. That's my fault. I love you too much. Maybe it'd all be simpler if I hated you. Okay, let's not speak about it anymore. Pretend as if I didn't say anything. And don't be afraid. I never go back on my decisions. Armida? Yes, sir? I can't find my blue pullover. This one is too heavy. It has to be here somewhere. I picked it up from the laundry yesterday. Maybe it's here. Come on... look harder. - There you go... - Please, sir, it's not right. - You like it, huh? You like it... - Yes, I like it... yes... Yes, I like it... Go and answer. Who is it? Yes, I'll tell him right away. Sir, it's Alfredo. He says the car is ready. Tell him I'll come down. And I want a coffee before I leave. - He'll come down. And he wants coffee. - Good, then I'll have some too. Always the same story with the pullover. - Be still... Be still, I tell you! - Come on... - Come on, he's coming down. He's coming down! - Even better. They're going out tonight. Hi, mom. Renato, that young man killed his wife, isn't that so? I don't know, mom. Even if I did, I couldn't tell you. Strange... he comes from such a good family... You'll see, they'll try to say he's insane. Of course they asked for the psychiatric exam. - Where did you read that? - I guessed it. What a wretch, to kill his wife! But why? Why? - I don't know, mom. - They didn't get along! Easy! As if I... as if I, after realizing what kind of man your father was... And instead, "finiz"! Over and done! I left and that's it! Why do you torment yourself with this story about dad? Come on. It's ancient history. Well, the truth is, he left me. - But I never thought about killing him. - That's all we need. Why? Maybe it wasn't a bad marriage? You know something about that as well. But I found the strength to push forward. Because I had you! But you think I didn't suffer? Now I suffer less, sure. Now I'm old. But I didn't forgive him. And I never will! - Come on, mom. - You defend him because you don't know him! Won't you offer me anything tonight? - Why didn't you say so? You're hungry? - No, I'm not hungry. - You don't want anything? - Make me some coffee, okay? - Ciao, Maria Teresa! - Ciao, Valeria! Finally! I was afraid you'd never come here again. Please stay here till tomorrow. Please, don't refuse. We'll drive you back. Okay. Thanks, Alfredo. - Don't tell me you're going to city tomorrow. - God forbid! - Then Fabrizio is going? - Who could make that lazy bum move? Then why did you tell me to send away my driver? Because... someone would like to accompany you back home. Someone? Who is it? Who? Come on, Maria Teresa... use your imagination. Didn't you notice his car? It's your friend Molteni. Come on, relax. It's not an ambush. He came to do some in-house work. It's pure coincidence. Don't stare at me. You know I like to change things. - Good morning, Mrs... - Good morning. - You've grown so big. - My daddy gave this to me. - This is for you. - Go and play. The wind knocked down the climber plant again. - Why don't you fasten it up better? - Okay, I'm coming. The work in the garden will never be finished. Nothing ever gets done around here. The little one won't eat today either, ma'am. What torture. These kids are truly pathological. They want affection for breakfast, for snack, for lunch... I'll give them a psychology book to read. Then they'll understand the risks they are running. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Thanks. Why are you so nervous? Are you bothered with my presence? No. Why? Should I be? - Maybe you don't want me to drive you back? - Why not? You didn't give me an answer. You seem uneasy. What's wrong? Oh, it's nothing... Or maybe it is something. It must be the weather. - The winter will soon end. - Yes. I don't understand this obsession by Fabrizio. It's gloomy. Don't you think so? I'd like to ask him to embalm me as well. - Why would you want to do that? - No reason... What cheerful conversation you're having. The dinner is ready. It's nice seeing people having fun. But it's always better to eat first before getting embalmed. Here's your piggy. Now go to sleep. - You're such a good boy... - Mommy, I can't sleep. What are you waiting for. Lie down. Why don't you lie down? That's it. Good girl. You see? You are sleepy. Goodnight, dear. - Good night. - Ciao, mommy. - What are you doing? - You're beautiful. Thanks, but I don't think I heard you knock. I didn't knock. I was certain you'd... That I wasn't asleep? You were wrong. - I want to talk to you, Maria Teresa. - Right now? Yes. Right here, right now. Valeria told me a little bit about your situation. - What situation? - Regarding Marcello. - She shouldn't have done it. - Actually, she did the right thing. My love... let me look at you. You're so beautiful... I want you. - But I don't... - You don't? You don't want to? - It's not possible. - Why, my love? - I love you. - But what about Marcello? Marcello? Why don't you worry about yourself? I'll never ask for an annulment, Cesare. Never. My love... Please, leave. - Good night, my love. - Good night. It wasn't thieves. It was just the garage door banging. Take your clothes to the bathroom. Otherwise you'll flood the bedroom. I guess now you can sleep peacefully. You know what time it is? It's 4:00 in the morning. You're always the same man, always wearing those same pajamas. Molteni went to Maria Teresa's bedroom. - You saw him? - Yes. - You spied on them? - Yes. - Good job. - You'll moralize me now? What are you thinking about? Nothing. I'm tired. I'm sleepy. And I'm completely awake. It's those two's fault. - I'm sorry. - I'm not. Other people's love stories make me feel alive. You can thank God I'm like that. Otherwise I'd be a whore by now. I'm in a tunnel, Fabrizio! Every night, every day! How do the others do it? When I think about spending the rest of my life like this, I want to die! I don't want to hear you say that ever again. Understand? And don't even think about it. You're young, beautiful... - But that's not enough! - What are you talking about? You have a beautiful house, the most beautiful husband in the world... You have two kids. What more do you want? No, Fabrizio! No, it's not possible! I don't know if you can understand... I can't explain it, but believe me, it doesn't... it doesn't resolve anything. - I don't want you like this. - But, Valeria, everything is so nice... - Nice... and normal. - Then I detest normality! If I knew for certain that the rest of my life will be like this, I would kill myself. - You're crazy. - Or I'd kill you. You'd kill me? Why would you do that? Because you're my husband. If I am desperate, you must be part of it. And one day I might even convince myself... ...that you should be the one to pay for that instead of me. - Kids? Let's go! - I'm ready, Mr. Fabrizio. "Mr. Fabrizio"? What's up with this "Mr. Fabrizio" thing? Well, we don't know each other that well. It's been three weeks now that I pull my britches down in front of you. - Did I hurt you? - No. I'm a giant coward. And to think when I was little, I'd never cry when I went to the dentist. I had some courage back then. Growing up, I've lost all of it. Why are you saying that? Courage and cowardice don't matter here. The fact is, I'm always afraid. Don't ask me what I'm afraid of because I don't know the answer either. You wanna know something? When I'm out hunting, I always close my eyes before firing. It's true. You don't believe me? But it's the truth. Come sit down for a moment. Stop playing around with that stuff. Come. You see, right now I feel this urge to kiss you. I do. But I won't do it. Why do you think I won't do it? - Because I'm Vittorio's friend? - Let's not talk about Vittorio. - I've offended you? - No. No, you didn't. Then what's wrong? Is it Vittorio? I never understood him, and yet I know him quite well. He says he and his wife have been separated for 10 years, but he won't ask for divorce. What divorce! Vittorio was never married. What? I found out by chance. He deceived everyone. Including me. Well, it happens. Sometimes a man lies without wanting to, and then... Then he doesn't have the courage to tell the truth. Courage... In all those years we lived together... Don't cry. It makes you ugly. In other words, I clearly told him what my opinion is. I said I don't think this was murder... Even though there are all the reasons to suspect him. "According to me", I said... "... it was an accident. A pure and simple accident". - And him? - Who? Fabrizio? No, the Judge. What does Fabrizio have to do with it? Didn't he ask, "Then why did you denounce him?" I never denounced anyone. Let's be clear about that. - I simply did my duty. - Forget it... And who called the carabinieri? Listen, I was already interrogated by the Judge... I told him what I had to say about this story. Besides... Have you forgotten about all the contradictions in Fabrizio's story? How could he not be contradictory when having to tell his story... ...while his wife's dead body was laying on the ground in front of him? And what did I tell the Judge? I repeated that story. Anyway... are there any news regarding the E.R. ward? Hypodermoclysis at 12:00 has been repeated? Yes. I want to give it a look. Will you accompany me? Sister Luigina is in the ward. And I have yet to register this batch of medicines. It's arrived almost a week ago. You're amazing. No woman has ever spoiled me like this, not even my wife. I bought them because I liked them... Not to make you aware of the fact that you never even bought me a flower. Because men offer flowers to women. What were you saying about your wife? Yes, my wife. I told you I was married, right? That's the first thing I tell every woman. But I am Lavinia, Vittorio. I'm not 'every woman. ' So, why don't you tell me about your wife? How come you don't wear the ring? So you can more easily catch your victims? Lavinia, you're an intelligent girl,... You're not planning on making a scene right at this moment? Why? Do I look jealous? You're mistaken. It's just simple, logical curiosity. - Female curiosity. - Female. If you say so. Anyway, we split up after barely a year. Therefore... I'm basically a bachelor. It's only three of us now in the whole house... Me, Rosaria, and the gardener. The kids are the villa on the lake. Mrs. Costanza took them there. What else could she do? Poor kids, they must be hurting... Especially Renzo. I think he realizes something's wrong. But not Cristina. She's still too little. Mrs. Costanza was here when that journalist came over. He wanted to interview us about the accident! But Mrs. Costanza sent him away in quite a manner... - You know where I was? - No,. Where? - I was with the Judge. - Even you? Yes. In fact, I also saw Dr. Conte. He was coming out of the Judge's chamber. Then they interrogated me, Morese and the tobacconist's son. - You know him? - No. I was summoned as well. I can't imagine what he wants with me. - And what did you tell him? - Me? What new information could I give him? They were the ones who went hunting. Except for them, only God knows what really happened. There were no arguments in this house in the final days. - I told that to the Judge. - How about the other days? Well... the Judge asked me if they got along. How would I know that? Is there a couple that truly gets along? I can't act like someone who doesn't know things. In any case, I told him everything... I told him about the quarrels and how he hit her. What? He hit her? Fabrizio! Fabrizio... Fabrizio, please! What is it? - Come here! Right now! - I'm coming. - Get down on your knees. - Excuse me? I said get down on your knees! Here you go. Do you know you got me pregnant again? You'll never touch me again. I swear! Never again! Do you hear me?! - My dear... - I won't let you! - Don't be like that, dear... - Let me go! Let me go! Don't touch me... But he loved her. He could very well have loved her... Even if she let him go out without a dime in his pocket. You know that, right? She controlled the piggy bank. She made all the decisions. The truth, my dear, is one should never get married. It always ends badly. You think rich people were made to live as a couple? - And what about poor people? - Much less. Many live together without getting married. Well, it's good while it lasts. And then... thanks and goodbye. Mrs. Valeria was so kind... What a disgrace it was. What a disgrace. How do I think things went? I don't know, Sir. Armida, call the Mrs. for me. The theory that Valeria's death was an accident is reliable. I wouldn't be so pessimistic, seeing there's no real motive... Yeah, yeah, I know, there are some. But they're very weak. That's not what I meant. One motive nullifies the other. I told you my opinion. You see, I'm a bit of a biased witness, a worried relative. Don't worry, Sir. I already spoke to the Bar. The bishop is outraged against human justice. As for the divine one, the trials there, luckily they do it behind closed doors. It is appropriate to say it. Yes, yes, let me know. Certainly. Thank you. Goodbye. I did all I could do. You ask a question. It may be banal, but make it be precise... And then you can expect an answer that is banal, but also precise. - Do you understand? - Yes. Otherwise you'll never get the right answer. - Why? I don't get it. - I'll give you an example. Let's say you're going around asking if someone is good at playing pool. Someone says, 'Yes, he plays good,' the other guy says he doesn't. Then there's a third person that says, 'He's okay, but he loses when he gets nervous. ' Then you have to ask why is he nervous, when is he nervous, how often... It's a series of questions corresponding to a series of hypotheses. One person says he's nervous because he's got liver problems... The other guy says he's nervous because he argued with his cousin. And then another guy says he's always nervous during springtime. So it's a series of questions, a series of hypotheses of answers... And from there you pull out the truth. You know, I always thought that your job was fascinating. Let's not exaggerate. Are you saying your job isn't? You don't interrogate your students? I would say I ask questions rather than interrogate. In any case, do you see that we could collaborate? You as well... What is it about this case that interests you so much? Well, it's because... because it seems meaningless. A happy couple... and he kills his wife. - So I think... - Well? I think it becomes a symbolic crime. There are no valid reasons on a personal level. I mean, in this couple's private life... But maybe there are reasons regarding their social life. These days, marriage makes no sense. And automatically, a crime against marriage has a meaning. That's true. - I shock you? - No, no. You only seem a bit drastic. Are you sure of never wanting to get married? If I were you, I'd ask: "Are you sure you'd never marry me?" Please, Lidia, I was speaking vaguely. I know. I was kidding. Sometimes I crack jokes like this. I have no idea why. - Please... - No. - Why did you cry at the restaurant? - No reason. It was a song by Mina that was popular when I was in high school. A boy always sang it. Ah, so there was a secret suitor after all. It was during the final year, we were in class together. How come you never told me about him? Because it doesn't concern neither you nor me. - It only concerns him. - And how did it end? Well? Tell me. Not even a year went by and he died in an accident, right after Easter. Well, goodnight. And then? I was there fishing when I heard a noise... I turned around and he was holding the lady in his arms. At one point he put her down. I stood there watching. Then I noticed she had blood all over her. Then he saw me. I got scared so I ran away. But I continued looking behind me... And I saw him dragging her away... He was basically running away. And he saw you? He looked at me. Then he disappeared in the woods. You think he ran away because he saw you? I'm not sure. But then I heard a car engine. And you didn't think of telling anyone about it? I told my friends at the bar, but everyone already knew the story. And when did you see the gun and the bag? When I came back after a while. A bit deeper in the woods, there was another gun with the telescope. But tell me, that stupid Fabrizio... I wonder what need was there to go and tell Attorney Bellini... ...that for a conscientious collector... ...the difficulty is not so much in embalming dead birds... ...as much as it is killing them properly? Who knows, maybe even Bellini now thinks that Fabrizio... Don't you think that's damaging? By the way, Maria Teresa, has your husband spoken to anyone at the Bar? Yes, I think he spoke to the Bishop. They know each other for a long time. - Marcello would make a great priest. - Excuse me? Nothing. I'm just saying Marcello doesn't say much, but I know he did it. Regarding the accident... I am absolutely certain that Fabrizio didn't do it on purpose. Okay, so they didn't get along. What difference does it make? Who doesn't argue? Me and Giovanni, while he was alive... You and Marcello... who knows how many times. No, we never argue. No? Then you're the only ones. You must be a perfect couple! But the rest? No... If every couple who argues were to shoot... We'd be in a civil war, don't you think? I believe the investigator asked Piero... ...if Valeria and Fabrizio were happy together. But who is really happy? Actually, it's the unhappiness that keeps us together. Don't you think so? And according to you, what does a truly happy person do? They kill? - Good day. - Put it on the train for Genoa, please. - It's just this bag. - Very well, sir. I hope your mother gets well soon. We got here too soon. Now we have to wait half an hour. I told you so. You don't have to wait. You're kind enough. Besides, you hate driving. I'm forced to drive for a few days because Alfredo quit. - When did that happen? - Yesterday. He wants to go work in Rome... What do I care? You have something to tell me, don't you, Marcello? Go on. - Armida is pregnant. - Pregnant? The baby is mine. That's right... It's mine. You're surprised. And yet there's a very simple explanation. Easier than to say. You told me clearly what you think of us, didn't you? You were looking for a break and you got it. Sometimes petty facts help resolve the situation... No matter how complicated it may seem. What are you thinking? Do you hate me? I don't think anything and I don't hate anyone. Maybe you didn't understand, Maria Teresa... Aren't you considering the gravity of the consequences for both of us? Armida is pregnant. With my child! The child is mine and I plan to claim him as mine. I have to ask for the annulment of our marriage. Valenza! Valenza Station! You know how preferable those well-thought out crimes are, Terenzi? I had one in Sondrio, some time ago... So perfect, all it took was to find a crack... ...and figure out all the inner workings. Instead, here... Everything is normal here. It's all normal and all... all guilty. It's normal how that poor thing was shot, targeted. Yes, targeted, because ballistics are clear, right? A gun that falls on the ground fires upwards. It doesn't fire straight or horizontally. What kind of accident is that? Now we have to find the motive. And what comes out? Everyday life. I could close the file and write 'Motive: Life' on it. She was even a faithful wife. No, nothing comes of it. If anything, she's the one who had a motive for killing him... Albeit it's a generic motive. Maybe he's a minus habens? No, he's an intelligent person. Is he crazy? Not at all. There's nothing there, you see? We are being faced... with an accident. But it's an accident... disguised as an accident. - Ms. Lavinia Gallo to see you. - Let her in. - Good day, ma'am. - Good day. - Please, have a seat. - Good day. I really don't know how I can be of help. I can only repeat what Dr. Conte told you. Yes, actually... I already had a couple conversations with your husband. Dr. Conte is not my husband. Though in some cases it doesn't matter... ...if one carries a circlet around their finger. - Certainly. - I guess maybe there's no need to get married. Are you speaking in general or are you talking about the Sangermanos? What? Oh, I... No... No. Don't pay attention to what I say. I'm just not feeling well. - What is it? You seem troubled. - Just ask me what you want to know. I'll try and answer if I can. But I can tell you one thing right away. Fabrizio was certainly a terribly lonely man. And how do you know that? He confided in you? No. But a woman understands these things. I went four or five times to the Sangermano estate. - And that was enough for me. - Enough for what? - Weren't you Valeria's friend? - No. But don't think I said this as a criticism of Valeria. I really didn't. But I'm certain Fabrizio was lonely... ...terribly lonely. Because otherwise... In a marriage, even in a union... ...loneliness... is worse than a crime. That's what I think. My God, how many antennas... I haven't missed a single transmission this winter. Ask me about the TV dramas. I know everything! Are you married, Judge? No. But why do you feel so lonely? You were there when Fabrizio Sangermano came to the hospital with his wife's body? Yes. - Ciao! Congrats, you're punctual. - I'm always punctual! - I was surprised to receive your call. - Why? I didn't expect to see you before tonight. I left Terenzi in the office. Let him take care of business for once. - Is it going well? - What? - Come on. The investigation, of course. - Top secret. I can't say. I know, you're a very conscientious judge. Where are you taking me? For a meal out in the countryside. What are we celebrating today? It's all done with kitchen matches... It's incredible. Only a Carthusian could have such patience. - Here you go, sir. - Or maybe a life convict. - You want to go out for a walk? - No, sit down for a minute. - I really don't feel like it. - You ate too much? You definitely don't have a stomach like those guys over there. - Tired? - Yes. Actually, now that you mention it... Why don't we rest for a while? - Where? - There are rooms upstairs. I really don't feel like resting, but okay. Will you ask for the room? Let's go. The treatment is truly rejuvenating you this year, mom. I mean it. You look great. Let's talk about you. I never get to see you. How's it going? Any news? - I decided to get married. - Married? - Good day. - Good day, ma'am. That's Dr. Angelini. The other one is his sister. Poor woman... She walks with a limp for over 20 years. You won't even ask me who I'm marrying, mom? The name of the one who ensnared you is the last thing on my mind. What is it? You know what we celebrated today? My cowardice. - Your...? - Yes, my cowardice. I told my mother I want to marry you. Your mother? You told her before you asked me? Look, my mother had a tough life, a bad marriage... - It happens! - I'm the only person in that poor woman's life. And she won't share you with anyone else. You know I don't care about marriage, Renato. I don't believe in couples, in this mutual bond that should reassure us till death. In reality it's a reflection of our weaknesses and failures. You want proof? Even your mother acts as if you two are a couple. Indispensable to one another! And what's the result? Two victims. It's true... It's true, Lidia. You're right. But I love you. - I love you, Lidia. - I love you too. Will you marry me? You called, ma'am? Who got you pregnant? - I don't want to talk about it. - Who's the father? Your husband knows. You have to tell me. Who is it? Well? Don't you know it's your husband? It's impossible. Do you understand. Impossible! - I know that better than anyone. - And yet it's his child. What is it? Are you afraid? I won't hurt you. - But tell me who's the father. - Your husband. - But my husband is impotent! - Let go of me! Don't touch me! Come on, don't cry. I said I won't hurt you. Calm down. I'm not accusing you. I know my husband had to ask someone else to get you in this condition. - It's Alfredo's child, isn't it? - No. What are you waiting for? Take off your clothes. We have to make this child for the attorney. I care, you know? Think about what an opportunity this is. Come on, don't act stupid. It's not the first time you're getting laid. And this time we don't even have to be careful. Yes, I go hunting. Mrs. Sangermano organized a hunting party a few times for her outsider friends. I helped her out. I know the woods and I know how to find game. - And you didn't hear anything? - No. I only saw them enter the woods. The guns were hanging on their shoulders, they held each other's hand... - They were holding hands? - Yes. - They were a great couple, young, rich... - In love. That's another story. I know nothing about that. - I sprained my ankle! Fabrizio! - I'm coming! Take me in your arms. Is that okay? Come on, you're tickling me... - You like it? - Yes. I want to make love right here. Let's go to the hut. - I want to make love here! - Watch out. I'll drop you. - Yes, now, here... I want you... - Valeria... I want you, Fabrizio... Right here... Fabrizio... Valeria! Are you crazy? What are you doing? I want you... I want you... What's wrong? Squash it! Squash it, Fabrizio! Kill it! - It's nothing, Valeria. - Kill it! - Go on, my friend. - Don't touch me! - It's just a frog, Valeria. - Never touch me again! - Never! Understand? - Valeria... You make me sick! Why are you like this, Valeria? First you want me, then you run away. Why? Why? Because I'm desperate! So am I... No, not here... Sorry. - Is here okay? - Yes. Thank you. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Forget the typewriter, Terenzi. Transcribe by hand. As you can see, Mr. Sangermano, I obliged your wishes. We're here at your house. Now, please, respond to my questions with 'Yes' or 'No. ' Mr. Sangermano, I ask you to collaborate. - Did you love your wife? - Yes. - And your wife loved you? - Yes. I'm sure of it. - Did your wife hold any grudges against you? - No. Or... maybe she did. I don't know. Anyway, it's all the same, right? No, it's not the same, Mr. Sangermano. In that case I must think all your 'Yeses' can be interpreted as 'Nos'. Is that clear? No. You had satisfying intimate relations with your wife? - I think so... Yes. I don't know if others... - What 'others'? - Well, what do other couples do? - Ah... - Have you loved any other woman? - No. So you were faithful to your wife? But not on principle. I just wasn't available. That's all. - And you'd like to have been available? - Perhaps. You felt your life was being wasted? No, no. Before Valeria, yes. My life... was very sad. Mr. Sangermano... ...are you aware you could be charged with premeditated murder? But it doesn't make sense. Actually, there is a sense. The shot went straight. - Says who? - Your gun. - What an idiot... - I'm sorry? No, nothing. I was talking about the gun. Do you find my interrogation to be prejudiced or unclear? Yes. Which part? For example, you never once asked me if I suffer without Valeria. Oh, for God's sake, Mr. Sangermano... You can't expect me to treat you like a widower. You're an alleged murderer, until proven otherwise. Anyhow... are you suffering? I don't know anymore. I know I miss her. I miss her so much. - My life is over without Valeria. - How do you plan to survive? - I don't plan to survive. - What are you saying? You'll kill yourself? Oh, no... I don't have the courage. You know what I think about all the time? I'm waiting for someone to talk to me about her. That's all I think about. You refuse to cooperate, Mr. Sangermano. It's not that. My client is still in shock because of the accident... - What would you do in my position? - Me? I could never be in your position. It's impossible. If we make a mistake, it will only be your fault. You know that? Of course. Mr. Fabrizio did everything she asked for... He even moved into one of the guest rooms. He slept there... And it even seems he kept his promise never to touch her again. Or at least he did everything possible to keep that promise. Rosaria says he didn't manage to do it every time. One night I saw him trying to enter his wife's bedroom. But she wouldn't open the door. Valeria... open... Valeria? I always leave a glass of water on the nightstand... ...in case I wake up thirsty... But I forgot about it that one time. Hot, huh? This is a never-ending summer. I'm so thirsty. It must be something I ate. And there's not a single gust of wind tonight. But then again, it's that time of the year... Come. - No. - Why? It's not possible tonight. There's a storm brewing. - What is it? They argued again? - Something like that. The Mrs. doesn't want to be touched anymore... Ah... is that so? You're not like the Mrs.? Yes... I met her a few times, yes. Marianna is a charming girl. - I'm sure you'll be happy with her. - You think? - Thanks. - She'll make a great wife. You know, it was something... It was a spur-of-the-moment decision. And now I'm also about to make the big leap. That's funny... I was going to ask you to join me for a few days in Portofino... Have you noticed that the seasons come and go now as they please? Some seasons don't come at all. We haven't had an autumn for a few years now. - Wait for me in the car, Terenzi. - Yes, sir. - Hi, dad! - Renato! - How are you? - Good. I saw your mother yesterday. - And you didn't say hello. - No. She was in a fabric store. I stopped to look at the shop window. You know I always liked that. You like it because you see your reflection in the window. Tell me the truth, Renato. You think I aged a bit? You're still a very handsome man, if that's what you want to know. And yet your mother is in pretty bad shape, she's withering away... And the years you spend separated, they're that much more terrible. You made a good choice. Try and stay with Lidia forever. If you grow old together... ...you will never have to realize this ugly truth. - Bye, dad. - Bye, Renato. And Attorney Bellini did his job? He definitely did more than Attorney Testa. I didn't want to ask him for anything ever again. That's what I thought. I don't think I have to tell you that we're all standing by your side in this moment. We perfectly understand your feelings. But on my part, I would like to add that perhaps... ...if you had confided in us sooner, we wouldn't be in this position. And you insisted on saying your marriage was perfect... only yours. Indeed. Maybe it's our fault for wanting to believe... ...even though we were well-aware there's no such thing as a perfect marriage. That's a contradiction in terms. In short, let's say that a couple is mortal... Perfectly mortal. You couldn't have picked a worse moment. First it was poor Valeria, then Fabrizio in prison... And now it's you, too. It's Marcello who asked for annulment, not me. Indeed. He added insult to the offense against you... And he continues doing it day after day. It was to be expected from a Bar attorney. And you... what will you do now? You never asked me that until now. I have plans, but I think l’ll keep them jealously to myself. I'm sorry, Sir. Mr. Marino wishes to see you. - Shall I go with you? - No, no. Why do you think he's here? - Maybe he has some news. - I don't think so. - We would've heard about it. Good day. - Good day, Judge. - Good day. I apologize for insisting on seeing you, but I thought you'd be interested to know... What is it? This. You bothered to come and personally deliver this to me? Before you hear about it officially, I thought it best to come and tell you... Unfortunately, this death has created a particularly complicated case. Do you know simpler ones? I have drafted the preliminary ruling and sent it to the public prosecutor. Most likely... there will be a trial. And this way, you're off the case. - For now. - Good. This allows me to hear your opinion. I don't know. I don't know. I think no one, not even your nephew, can explain what really happened. How could that be? I mean it could have been an accident... ...or a voluntary act or something similar to a raptus. They contradictory hypotheses, Judge. I know. I know... If it's any comfort, they're the same words I used in my ruling. How do you think it will end? Will there be a trial? I can't imagine it. They'll try and establish... They'll try and 'reach' the truth. Meanwhile, my nephew has to stay in jail until you're searching for the truth. There's also a possibility your nephew is guilty. But I don't know what his guilt is. The Court will decide. - Do you believe in God, Judge? - Not exactly. - Are you married? - Not yet. The world should only be inhabited by old people. There'd be so much less struggle... You'll excuse me if I don't accompany you. Thank you. Subtitles: Ant123
