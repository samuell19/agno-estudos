What gives? Hey? - Did you lose something or what? - Don't. No, I swear not, Carlos. Don't jerk me off. What's with the look, dude? - I haven't done anything, Carlos. - Straight up? You don't have to lie to me anymore, dude. Carlos, hey... What? What's up with you, dude? What's wrong with you, huh? I screwed up, you bastard. How? Forgive me, dude. I'm not going to be mad if you've done something, okay? Hey, hey, hey! Today you can do whatever you want. You know why? Because today we are celebrating. We are, Carlos? Let me give you the good news, fuck! I've always looked after you, right? Since you were a little shit. - You don't understand, you bastard! - Let's see, listen to me! I got the money, dude. I got the money. Hey! Did you hear me? Today, this craziness ends We don't have to continue. What? Do you know who lent it to me? Mom. I come from your house. Did you see mom? I'm a fool, you bastard. - Forgive me! - What? - Forgive me! - Ah! Forgive you for what? Now what? C'mon, Oliver! - Forgive me, forgive me! - What the fuck are you on? Forgive me, you bastard! Forgive me, dude, forgive me! He is asking you for forgiveness... ... because he did not introduce us. Who's there? It was very late, bastard. Very late. Detective Marco Antonio Molina. I was having a little talk here with your brother. Drop that mother. DROP THAT MOTHER! I had to tell him, dude. It's that he threatened to kill mom, Carlos. What did you say to him? Hey? Look, brother, I don't know what my brother said, but... I'm sure we can clear it up. Number one: I'm not your brother. I'm official. And two: Of course we will clear it up. But not here. At the station. Let's get moving! Is that if you had told me you were going to get it, bastard! Hold! Do you have any paper to enter like that? I DO NOT HAVE ANY PAPER PINCH! As you see? I have your brother's confession, which is more than enough. He just threatened that he was going to kill mom, dude! Shut up now! Shut up, Oliver! What you are doing is called blackmail. And extortion. What I am doing is my job! I have witnesses. Videos from the store. LET'S MOVE ON! WE WON'T BE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN! WE SWEAR IT! - Oliver! - We pay him whatever! - Please please! - Ya, dude! We didn't do anything! Go back, back. Get off that, mother! Do not be stupid. Come on! You're a fucking idiot, dude! Güey, you do not understand anything, you bastard. Call mom! There he is, dude! Come on! Hands up! Oh! Aaaaaah! Brother, no! Oh! Motherfucker! Oh! Aaaah... Ca... Carlos... Carlos... HELP! HELP! HELP! SOMEONE CALL AN AMBULANCE. PLEASE! HELP ME! - Carlos! - Aaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! Close it up, close it up! Aaaaaah! I don't know what... I don't know what to do... I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Oh! What do I do? Oh! You shot my brother, you bastard! Motherfucker! You shot my brother! Nothing will happen to you! And it's better to shut up if you do not want me to put you... -... to you in an ambulance. - Now, pay attention to him, dude. Already! They've fucked us already, you bastard. Can we at least go to the hospital? No, we're not going to any hospital. In the station they'll know what to do with him. Further... After that explosion, of course, the city must be a mess. Come on man! What gives with these hairs? Your building is a dump. Oh! Oh! Oh! Why, if we are on the first floor, there are so many more floors going down? This is one confusing building! Again, this building is very confusing. No exit. How come there's no way out? Take me to the exit! No, this... I don't understand. If you move from here, I'll kill you. OPEN! OPEN! Oh! Oh! Ah... ah..ah... Ah... ah... ah... Don't... No no. This cannot be happening. This can not be happening. This is not possible, dude. It's the shock of the bullet, right? It's the shock of the bullet! Hey? We have to escape now by the elevator. OPEN THE DOOR! Sons of bitches! I don't know what's happening, but... I promise we're going to get out of here fast. I don't think it's fast. Ah, ah! It hurts? Ah... I'm fine, dude. Look up. Above... We have to escape by the roof before he returns. Don't! There is no roof. Ah... ah... ah... What... what's going on here? What's going on here? Aaaah! No, this cannot be happening. Aaah! What did you drug me with? Answer me! What did you drug me with? WHAT DID YOU DRUG ME WITH! We're also trapped, and my brother is hurt because of you. Something happened with the explosion. I'm sure, I'm sure. Fuck! HELP! MY BROTHER IS HURT! HELP! SOMEONE HELP ME! I'm imagining all this, right? Carlos, it's real. This is happening. - Forgive me. - Ah... ay... Don't worry. No, not because of this. For everything. It's not your fault. Work for the Gamens. I knew everything. I knew about mom. Did he know about mom? And did he know about your illness, too? Oliver... Oliver, do you remember...? Do you remember the Acatlán labyrinth? When... When we got lost and mom went to look for dogs and police... and we were talking at the entrance. Do you remember, Oliver? Aaaah! Like, this reminds me of that. We have to take you to the hospital. We have to get out of here. MAD MOTHER! They say that this is when you're going to die, right? That you start to remember the moments of your life. Like that day, do you remember? And mother's scolding. Do you remember, Oliver? Carlos... -... what if I take the bullet out with something? - No, no. You'd end up infecting me. You barely know how to change a flat tyre You wouldn't be able to get a bullet out of me much less stop the bleeding, you bastard. SON OF THE CHINGADA, HELP ME TO REMOVE THE BULLET, CABRÓN! Oh, no, you bastard! Listen to me, dude! You cannot take the bullet out! The only thing you can do is... ... is to rinse the wound with water. We need to find water, dude. Have you got anything on you for the pain? - Aaaaah! Oh! Help me, you bastard. You shot him, dude. - Ah! Aaaah! Aaaaaaaay! Oh! Ooooh! Oooooh! Oh! Ooooh! Aaaaay! - Watch out, you bastard! - I'm not a doctor, okay? Or can you do it better? No, right? - Why did you shoot him? - Because he was running away. And because I did not know that we were going to stuck here locked for so many hours It was also in the leg. Don't mom! How long have we... been here, eh? Don't! It's been four and a half hours now. I did not shoot him. Again with that chingadera. - Let's see, listen to me, please! - That the gun went off by itself?!! LISTEN TO ME! This must have happened to you, that you're going somewhere, I don't know... ... walking in the street and suddenly you forget that you are in that place and... ... and-and... you start to-a-think about other things, your mind goes away... ... somewhere else and - and... ... an energy like a force that grabs you and... Stop shitting, you shot him, you bastard! Fair enough. Give him some for the pain. Where'd these come from? They're for personal use. I'm cold. You can't sleep for your work, right? So no more shooting at people. I'm coming, brother. I'm going. How long? I do not know? The drug you gave my brother, you bastard. How long is it until he wakes up? You drugged him, you bastard. I gave them to take away the pain. And since when does my brother care, huh? - How much time left? - Some hours! Today we celebrate 15 years of marriage. It was assumed that... ... we were all going to dinner to celebrate it. She is Fabiola, my wife, and my three daughters. Karla María and Elizabeth. I don't even know if they are still waiting for me or if they're part of this dream. Wherever they are... ... dream or not... ...I want you to know one thing. If my brother dies... ... I'm going to kill them. Oliver... Something's not right. Oh! No! No! No! No! - Carlos... - I feel bad. No, I do not know I can last much longer. I've seen mother. She's fine and then... ... I-I wake up and already... ...Hey. You and I are going out together, we're going to be fine. Listen, listen. Bastard, you bastard. Listen to me for fucking once... ...in your life. I'm dying, asshole. I... I never enjoyed any part of my life. And I was always... ... thinking about what I wanted to get to the next one... ... and when it came to the one that followed... ... I realized that... ... that the one before was better. Mmm... And I always wanted to be thirty, and now that I'm thirty... - I want, I want to have. - No, no, ya... Carlos! Enjoy, enjoy everything. Life is a long fucking road. And we don't get to go back. You are going to be someone very good. You are going to be someone who goes... ... you are going to achieve something great. I'm just, I'm just imagining this nightmare for... for the fucking bullet... ...but... ...it's more... ...you... ... you are not here anymore Chance... ... I already... already... ...I'm dead. Carlos! Carlos! Carlos! Carlos! Carlos! Carlos! Wake up, Carlos! Open your eyes, Carlos! Carlos! Carlos! Wake up! Wake up! Carlos! Big brother! No! Please! It reappears. Take away the food It reappeared. The bloody meal reappeared. How the fuck did it come back! No no. This is not happening. We've been 26 hours and we've finished everything! Motherfucker! NO! No, no! This wasn't there anymore. The fucking food reappeared! It reappeared! Don't! Against the wall, you bastard. If we are dreaming, nothing will happen to you If I shoot you, right, dude? You're not thinking straight, huh? You also said that you were not thinking clearly when you shot him my brother, bastard! Oliver, Oliver... What you are experiencing... ... is the symptom of loss. That is all. AND WHAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING IS CALLED THE LAST FUCKING... ... THOUGHT OF YOUR LIFE, CABRÓN! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! - Mutus nomen dedit cocis! - Mutus nomen dedit cocis! - Mutus nomen dedit cocis! - Mutus nomen dedit cocis! - Mutus nomen dedit cocis! - Mut... Can you shut up, please? I am working! They are the magic words of the new trick that Roberto taught me. Go! Choose a pair, Daniel. Okay. Okay, I'm going to guess your pair, but first I have to put them back And like all magicians I have only one deck, but I'm going to guess your pair. Please, help me a little: tell me in which row they are. Mutus nomen dedit cocis! Mutus nomen dedit cocis! It doesn't work anymore! Come on! Yes! Come on! You've got the trick wrong. Besides, it is not for your age. You don't understand how it works. I was practicing, give me a chance. Look, Camila. They are not magic words. Each letter is repeated once in each word. They are pairs of letters, like the pair in the deck. Pair one you put in the two «M». And pair two in the two «U». And so when people tell you what row it is, you know what pair it is. Well, have you packed all your things? Because your mom is not going to do it, huh. Daniel? You're not going to take Gamen, right? Daniel? Oh no... We're leaving now, Daniel! I rented the movie you wanted. It's this, right? Yes? Let's get moving! Oh! Come, Camilita. Help me with your little bag. Take this one, okay? You go. Roberto, can you help me with my bags, please? Let's move on! Daniel, stop playing! . Oh no! I forgot the sandwiches. That rat stays, huh. Don't even think about taking her. Can you stop me following me around? I want to help. If you want to help, go and tell Daniel to leave his rat. No, no. You already know that I can't do that with Daniel. Pass me the aluminium. - The aluminum, Roberto. - Well, where is it? I don't know. Right now you have six hours of driving to look forward to. Yes, but at seven o'clock we reach the sea, he goes to his father's and it all becomes worthwhile. My life, you invited us. Mmm? You already knew that Tomás has his hotel. - Yes, but. - Yes, Daniel is a very mature child... ... ten years, but he misses his dad. And you are the most loving man that exists. Hey? They just have to spend more time together. Quiet. There's a spot of mayonnaise. [Laughs Oh! Are you going to take the mouse? - You the rabbit? - Come on, kids, it's almost one. Let's go, I do not want to drive at night. - Camila, you've got your inhaler? - Yes, in my backpack. You, Daniel, do you have your sister's spare inhaler? Good thing you reminded me. I'll go for it It's Dad! Daddy, Daddy! - Oh, yes: Daddy, Daddy. - Hello Dad. Well, you know, Mom was late. Did you really buy them? Can I take Gamen? Yes! I'm going to take your miniature decks to make you magicians along the way. You know, grandma's. No, he will not let me. Let's see, I'll pass it to you. Yes, yes, pa, I'll pass it on to you. What's happening, Tomás, how are you? Yes, I know. No, don't worry. Roberto is going to drive. Yes, he did sleep well, aha. I don't know what you want to do. They're going to stay with you, right? Well, if you want me to take them to the hotel before seven, I'd better go, it's almost one. Another thing: Tomás, Roberto has been sober for five years... ... you bring that up again, and I swear I'll kill you, okay? - Let's move on! - Let's move on! - Ready! - Let's go to the sea! - Why? - Why? Because in the sea... ... life is tastier... ... at sea, I love you much more. More! With the sun, the moon and the stars... ... in the sea, everything... It smells funny, doesn't it? I don't smell anything. What is this? Did someone put bamboo in here? Roberto, why do we always see that mountain and we never reach it? Oh, because we are on an infinite road. What does "infinite" mean? I want you to reach it. - Oh yeah? Hold on then. Hey! Roberto, everything is going to spill. If you want to arrive before six, I'll have to speed up, huh. Come on, you'd run out of nice nails then. Daniel, are you going to do magic to Gamen? You're going to get dizzy How are you doing, children? I need to go to the bathroom. Yes, me too. We'll stop soon. There's a gas station five kilometres ahead. Mommy, how much time before we get there? Oh, my love, about four and a half hours. So much? No, mommy, seriously? Really. Kiss me. And Fred too. Oh, you want him more than me. - No, both. - What about Daniel? He's third. Thank you. You're fourth! And Gamen? Oh, well, he's five. Daniel says don't believe anything, that you're not our dad. I'm not your dad, but you can believe everything because I love you so much. For example, this juice is very rich, do you want to try? I can't because of my allergies. But this is guava, this won't affect you. Trust me. Take it, it's rich. You will like it, you will see it, try it. Mmm... It's rich, isn't it? Fred says he likes you. Oh, well, tell Fred that he loves me too. Roberto says that you like him very much. Yes, I trust you, even if Daniel scolds me. Camila, you have to go to the bathroom - We will not stop again! - I'm going, mom! Ok, I trust you so much that I'll give you to keep Something very important while I go to the bathroom. Yi! Wow! I'll take very great care of it! - After a while I'll return it to you. - Goodbye! She has asthma, Roberto! Sugar can cause allergies! The lemon can also trigger it! - But it's guava. - It has lemon, Roberto, lemon. Yes, I knew it. Not a second! Not a second. Fuck! I can't leave you with them! What do you have? Relax, nothing's wrong. - What do you have? - Wake up, Sandra. Are you ok, sweetheart? Take water. Take water. Slow, slow, no. - Little sips. - And sit up straight. It's okay, you're okay, aren't you? Take a deep breath, breathe. Breathe Roberto, calm yourself! Quiet, calm, nothing's wrong. - But slow down! - Here I go, there I go. Take a deep breath. Fool. I don't know why you gave her that juice, I didn't know. Take a deep breath. Where did you leave your inhaler? Calm. Calm. - Your inhaler! - Ah. No! You've broken it, Roberto! Bring out the spare, Daniel. Didn't you bring it? Sorry, ma. I forgot when dad and I were talking on the phone. We're going back Quiet. Drink water, keep calm. Take a deep breath. Deep. We are already halfway there. Three hours are missing, we still arrive. No no. We're going back Breathe, calm, my love, quiet. There, slowly. Deep, deep. What? I don't know, but we can't go there. - Breathe slowly. - No, yes, we have to go back. - Come on, Roberto! Slowly. Remember, if you hug Fred hard, Fred'll take it away. - Don't take him from me! - Breathe slowly! There was no one in the store. I took it without paying. Let's move on. Daniel, give her a pill. Let's go, Roberto! Let's get a move on! I don't understand how you couldn't know, eh! I'm sure you were drinking yesterday! I've been sober for five years! Why should I start drinking yesterday? Sandra, for the love of God. I've never had something like that happen, I swear to you for my life! I'venever felt so clumsy, so unskilled with my hands, with my feet! Of course it happened to you! You are a clumsy ass with your feet - with your hands, with your body... - Do not talk like that! - It happens with you every day! - Stop screaming! You're making Camila more nervous! - Don't tell me what to do! - Be quiet! It fell out of my hand and I stepped on it with my foot. Ya, drive. Yes you did! Thomas was right! You're a fucking drunk! You don't know how to handle things! We haven't gone past any exit, Sandra! You missed it, Roberto, and you know it! I can't breathe well, Mommy! Let's see, close your eyes. Close your eyes! Now breathe. Hold Fred very tight. Hug him! Now take a deep breath. I feel like I'm going to drown when I close them! - What the fuck! - You see? I told you. I told you that you went past the exit! No, no, wait. I'm sure this is the same gas station. Here, drink water. Hello? Hello? I need help! Someone? Please help! HELP, MY DAUGHTER IS HAVING AN ASTHMA ATTACK! - This can't be. - I don't think there's anybody here. It is impossible that there is another gas station for 300 kilometres around What? You built the road, did you? No, I did not build it, but I drive it every week I've been going to the plant for twenty years. And I swear to you on my life that gas station doesn't exist. And besides, this sign here! IS THE SAME! Roberto, I don't think you've noticed that it's not up to date This map is three years old. - What does it matter? - Seriously? Stupid! Mom, we can not listen to you. I'm sure we passed that exit. You think I'm crazy, but I swear that this road it is repeating itself. - Do what you want, I'm going for help. - Daniel! Where are you going? Where are you going? Daniel! Go get him, you bastard! Daniel, wait! Wait! Wait! Where are you going? I'm not going where you say! You are not my dad! I know I'm not your dad, but I know this way better than you. - Trust me. - I will never trust you! I will never go your way! Oh! Let go, idiot, let go! I saw how you missed the exit. You will get us even more lost! What is going on mommy? Why aren't we there? I can't breathe well. Please, Roberto. I beg. We're going back We are going back to see that we did not have any exit, but we're wasting time. Everything will be fine, my love. Everything will be fine. Breathe, yes? Breathe Roberto, your truck's clock is wrong. See the light! Mine also says 7:20. It's just that it can not be. It can not be, it can not be. May all exits have disappeared! Can not be! Look! It's the same sign. Where we are? Where we are? Can not be! This is a nightmare. Can not be. This is not happening. Camilita, let's see. I need you to calm down. And that you breathe very deep. Very deep. We are about to arrive. Calm down, we're almost there. A little more. He lost us. I trusted him. We have to find where the explosion came from. - No, Camila! - Don't! Camila! He fainted. Awake. You will wake up, you will wake up. It happened to him once last year, but he has to wake up. But that time if we had the epinephrine injection, ma. Hold! I want to arrive, please! What's going on! OMG! Why! Why! Why! Why! AGAIN! WHAT IS THIS? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO US? WE DID? Stay here! I'm going to get help! Where are you going, Roberto? We are lost on an infinite road to there and there! But not for the sides. Stay here! What's wrong with you, Roberto? Don't leave us here! Robert! If you have a pulse, why aren't you breathing? Why don't you wake up? I promise I won't bother you again but wake up. Please wake up. What are you doing, mom? Didn't you hear Roberto say don't move? Go for help, mom! What are you doing? Mom, slow down, you don't have a licence! Mom! - This is a nightmare, a nightmare. - Mom, slow down, you don't have a licence! - It's a nightmare! - No more advances! Nothing is happening.

How many months after your retirement party at the station? Three and a half. And you? Me, nothing. I've always been here. I still can't remember what I want to say to you. I never remember. Tomorrow you will remember. Come. Come on. Remember. Marco Antonio Molina. Marco Antonio Molina. Marco Antonio Molina. Marco Antonio Molina. Marco Antonio Molina. Marco Antonio Molina.

We found it on the road. - Who? - Sandra and me. Sandra? Your mom. I don't have a mom She doesn't remember you either. I have something... ... very important to tell you. But I can't remember what. That's how old we are, Daniel. That's how old we are, Daniel. Daniel Daniel! OLIVER! OLIVER! What do you want? It's three in the morning! NOW I REMEMBER!

The last time your mom spoke It must be more than 20 years ago. When you went to live by yourself. This was no longer life for her. She's goneto a better place. Any place is better than living in hell. Aaaaaaah! Aaaaaaah! Aaaaaaah! Aaaaaaah! What's wrong? Aaaaaaah! Aaaaaaah! Roberto, calm down. Keep calm. Please. Tell me what's wrong with you. I am Ddda- ni-eeeel! Daniel? Who is Daniel? Daniel... Daniel... Daniel... - What happened? - This happened. Why do you believe the death... of your sister... ... was your fault for forgetting the inhaler? That's not true. It was my fault. - I always knew that. - No, you don't know. You think I was this detective... ... with a wife... ... Fa-Fabiola. That's a lie. And I've been living it... ... for 35 years... And I finally remembered just now. Because I'm going to die. And if you don't act now... ... the same thing will happen to you. There is no time. Once they warned me. and I forgot. A long time ago. I was a ten year old boy. I did magic with gray hair. And he called me... ... Daniel. That is your name. Write it. It is the only way... ... so you do not forget. ... they told me... ... and I never wrote it. Write it. - I do not understand. - Shut up! You will not understand. Just write it. Do not worry, I will not forget. Yes you will forget. As I forgot. They need me to tell you... ... when you see the patrol car... ... and you go up, you will forget. But there's no elevator. How do you know there's going to be a patrol car there? I had already heard this. Let me tell you a little about me. My name is not Roberto. My name is Ruben. I could hardly remember. In 1949... ... I was traveling on a field trip. I was ten years old. My friend Juan and I... ... we couldn't get back in our canoe. And the instructor agreed to take us... ... on a green bamboo raft. And suddenly, the instructor... ... had an accident. Juan bled and died after three days. And the instructor and I... ... we spent on our own... ... 35 years passing by without ever treading earth. Until he died, then he told me how to get to land. As I'm telling you right now. And he told me about the train tracks... ... eternal. In which he had lived 35 years... ... travelling on a train that never stopped. ... and I found the red truck, I passed by you and your mom. I couldn't remember anything until now. Before dying, he warned me: That he did not enter the patrol car. But I didn't listen to him. Now I've realized that I've spent my whole life. 70 years. Thinking of everything I could do. - Caught. - In two... Incidents 35 years in the lagoon with the instructor... On the road with Roberto. - And 35 years here. - With you. It was not even a waste because it wasn't real. Nothing is real. You and I are not real. We are an alternate version of reality. The real you, and the real me... ... we are in another place that is real. Elsewhere they are happy. And we... ... we are in these infinite hells. To move physically and emotionally. And generate that energy... ... and happiness of our true "I"... It is what you and I are. The machinery of the real world. It isn't just physical movement that's important. The emotional one is too. Therefore, a human sacrifice... ... it is required to create an incident. Young people get better these 35 years... ... move, enjoy... ... and that makes their true "I's"... ...In the real world... ... be happier... ... when they are young, thanks to that movement... ... physical and emotional that we transmit. But old people are not able to enjoy. We live trapped by the past. - We do not let go. - Because... ...In the real world... ... young people are always happier... ... than the old people, for what we transmit... ...from here. - Write who you are. And do not enter the patrol car. Do not enter the elevator. Help me! Let's change this! When you remember who you are... ...you will regret. As I regret now. As I remembered. And I've told you everything... I'm going... 30th floor, please. Oh, no, wait, wait. What, don't you feel ashamed in front of...? ...of Karl? Me, I'm not ashamed, this is your night. Thanks, Karl... - And where are you from, huh? - Russia. Russia... What are you doing up here, Karl? Do not be rude. We were going to Russia for our honeymoon... ... but they told us it's a bit dangerous right now. We're going to South America. How long? - How long have you been here, Karl? - 20 years. 30th floor Your luggage, please. It's okay, Russian. You carry this for me... And I'll carry this... Why did you throw my backpack, Russian? Aaaaaah! What happened? Aaaaaah! You're okay? What happened? I think I was stung by a bee, darling. What? Here? Right now? Stung? That's not possible! Quick! Your injection - I think it's broken. - No, no. The idiot broke it! He's allergic to bee stings! Where is the door to the stairs? Where is it? We've already been here! I don't understand! What's happening? There's no fucking door, Russian!
