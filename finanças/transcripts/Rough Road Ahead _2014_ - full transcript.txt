Who doesn't want to be mistaken for bums? We don't! Who's concerned about peace on earth? We are! You loaf around in parks and alleys! Who can't comprehend your senseless laziness? We can't! We can't! We can't! Who has the courage to be ashamed for you? We do! Who won't let our future be taken away? We won't! Who sees you besmirch old churches, and loses all respect for you? We do! We do! We do! There has to be someone who doesn't just destroy someone to uphold our faith, who learns who educates himself, who does his daily stint, to build tomorrow's world! Tomorrow's world is here already: it's us! Who won't be the hollering crowd any more? We won't! And who says that work is shameful? Who is so bored, so entirely blind? You are! You are! You are! Who wants to have a good chat with you? We do! Who has their own weaknesses! We do! Who, indeed, uses the same old tricks? Who has long hair, too, only it's clean? We do! We do! We do! We, too, can be tough! We, too, can grow beards! We, too, often go too far... script and direction Christian Frosch Born? Yes. Date! 12th March 1922 in Dresden. Son's name and date of birth? Martin, 12th January 1950. Denomination? Evangelical. Roman Catholic. Mother's occupation? I was... - Housewife. Housewife. Daughter's name? Rosemarie. Reason for divorce? Well, I only got back from Russia in '49 and it turned out we were no longer compatible. The old story. - She met someone else. My mother and I raised him. Iron Cross, 1st class. My word! You can have that piece of scrap. There's no shame in being a hero. Between May 3 and October 18, 1956 you underwent psychiatric treatment? Yes, effects of war, psychological. Since then you've been on disability benefits? That's right. Is this the first time she ran away? You know... ...in this day and age, it's not easy to raise a child. I can barely sleep without worrying about my daughter. What is it you want? He goes to high school and he's among the best. You do know your son was expelled from school? You could say he's a bright student. I feel sorry for him. Genuinely. But... ...if someone crosses the line, he has to live with the consequences. It's all his fault. A rotten family. A good family, humble background. They did their best, but couldn't send Rosie to high school. Which was a real disappointment to her. That's how it started. But... a decent family who came to church every Sunday. Rosemarie was in my confirmation class. There are things I can't say, things that touch the confessional seal. I don't know how to say it, Father. It... ...would be best if she had left home already. If that's what's best for her, then... Something bad is going to happen. I can feel it. There are homes run by Catholic sisters. They're strict... ...but they provide support. Well... It won't kill her. Right? Yes, but what's the accusation? Neglect. Existing or imminent. Is it because Martin has long hair and listens to beat music? I should have my own hell for anger... ...a hell for pride... ...and a hell for caresses... ...a whole symphony of hells. Do you have the new Kinks? The Kinks and The Who are old news. Excuse me, I've been to England, Miss Rosemarie from Germany. Rosemarie? Miss? Excuse me, Ruby is my name. Ruby? Someone named after a Stones song shouldn't be throwing stones. The Stones? You mean the Rolling Stones? - Yes. Only one thing is worse than the Beatles: the Stones. By the way, on the 18th the "Revelation" takes place in Offenbach. The Monks at the Beat Beat Beat live concert, on television! The Monks? You mean those idiots with bald patches? You're an idiot. Have you seen a ghost? My father just went past. I'm not sure if he saw me. So what? He'll give me a good hiding if he sees me wearing this. Shall I have a word with him? No! He doesn't even know that I work here. I don't want to hide any more. Bite into the apple, Snow White. Do you want to live with dwarves forever? If I'm no good as a prince, I'll be the stumbling block. Better to fall than lie in a glass coffin. Kill yourself, you cowardly asshole. Take that off before he sees it! Please! Rosie please! - Ruby! My name is Ruby, Mother. Glasses off. You know what that's for. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest and bless what you have given us, Amen. Rosie, no food until you've changed. There's no bread? Katia! You shouldn't have taken her out of school... Rosie has to earn money, or we won't manage. At the tailor's shop, they're looking for... No, my wife will not go to work! Period! What's the matter today? I borrowed that from the store. - You'll stop working there. It's indecent. You'll work somewhere else. Over my dead body. You should be grateful. What should I be grateful for? That you were ever born, for example. If those 2 minutes of work were so hard, then thank you. Thank you, Daddy. Thank you. How did this evil get inside you? Why do you hate me so?! I don't know. I don't know either, Daddy. Could you think of us just the once, Rosie? Ruby, Mother. Ruby! Until you're 21 and of age, you'll do what I tell you! Get out. Are you happy now? Are you happy now?!! Get out!!! I... ...I have anger towards god. If Jesus loves me... ...why won't he protect me? Jesus loves you, Rosemarie. Don't ever forget that! Arthur Rimbaud experimented with drugs... ...became addicted to absinthe... ...and during a fight with his friend Verlaine, he... ...shot at Rimbaud. But he only hit his hand. "Une Saison en Enfer" - "A Season in Hell", he wrote at 19... At 21... he'd had enough. He stopped writing, and died of bone cancer at 37, a happy and fulfilled man. I've seen through it! The rotten childhood drill, when does it end? Keep going for another 20 years, if you can manage 20? No! I'll surrender to Death now! Working is too easy for my pride! "Orgasm and Repression". You can go Miss Weiss. - Yes, headmaster. And take that one with you. You stay here! Don't shoot yourself in the foot. I like you. I wasn't born with a golden spoon in my mouth either. We were poor, really poor. People like us, we don't fall up the stairs. Move on to a Swiss boarding school, like your good buddy. We fall down! I've always done my own thinking. And that was much harder... ...in those days, back then. The mind is free. And I didn't need long hair for that. As far as I know, there are no laws defining hair length. Intelligence is the ability to adapt to a situation. No, it's the ability to juxtapose the right thing to the wrong situation. Perhaps you're less intelligent than I thought. Jesus had long hair, too. Is that your career of choice, crucifixion? Final warning. Get out. Granny! Silly me... I don't remember where I am. Which way is home? Granny, no one knows for sure. Toadstools? You want to poison us? Not a bad idea. That's poison. I know, but it's interesting. We used to have them in Russia. Martin, war is... ...quite boring. Waiting, waiting, waiting... ...the occasional bit of carnage... ...you're dead, or you've lost a leg or something. If not, you're rewarded with some more waiting. If anyone tells you that war is adventurous, ...they've never been in one. Or they're easily entertained. Go back to sleep. Hi Granny. What's up? My Dad's nuts. He stormed into my room... Do I have to take out all the locks? Claustrophobia... Everyone's bonkers here. Martin? From my parent's cellar... ...two bottles of Barolo! And here... With the Monks, I shall conquer Fort Ruby. You have to keep your mouth shut! Her father will kill her if he finds out! My parents are such assholes. Why? They actually bought me the Vespa. A wonderful, gorgeous VBB-150... ...with all the bells and whistles. I'd love to have such asshole parents. Yeah, but they won't let me have it. It just sits there... locked up, inaccessible... Poor Vespa. I lie awake at night and hear her voice... Save me! Free me! My parents say: 'Son, first you'll have to cut your hair...' ...rain falls down from heaven... ...down on the dark green grass. And if the dear sun does not return... The forest creatures... Have you got some toadstools on you? - Yeah, sure. ...and all the tired flowers... ...will die a tired death. Why do we do this to ourselves? You feel something? - It's too soon. It takes a while to kick in. And if we puke it all up? - Not all of it... Fucking backwater... I want real drugs! Beggars can't be choosers. Come on! Let's go in. But it's way too cold! You sissies! A band with Ruby as the lead singer... Our own band, our own songs, our own lyrics, in German. Like those "Schlager" twits, nobody sings in German. Exactly, that's why. Do what no one does. Katja? Katja! Where is Rosie?! Where's Rosie?!! Where is my daughter? Not here. Anti-social vermin! Moping around, living off the dole... ...and then your layabout son makes eyes my daughter! Off to the gas chambers! No half measures. I don't have to put up with this. I was in the war! I was a Sergeant! Then stand to attention! As Master Sergeant I'm your superior! Everyone's bonkers here. Manitu... ...In your... Goddamn it, I want the Vespa. Who cares if I have to cut my hair. So what? Then they have you. And then? What's next? I have my Vespa. Say 'yes' once, and you're one of them. All or nothing? If nothing means a Vespa VBB-150, that is something! Because hair grows back. Go and brown-nose your parents! Slut! And you knew! How long has this been going on? I didn't know anything. How long has this been going on?! I want to know one thing, young lady... Are you still a virgin? Are you still a virgin?! You're still a virgin, right? Yes. I want to be sure. And you're going to check! I won't take my clothes off in front of you. I gave birth to you. I know what you look like. Sit down. Rosemarie, sit down. Rosemarie! There, go ahead! Everything's fine. You're lying to me. I want to see! Go away! Leave me alone! Leave me alone!! Rosemarie! They celebrate death. They celebrate death... With dead words, they chase life. Words are their accomplices. Death to the dead poets. So... ...lets celebrate the dead poets then. Translate some Ovid, will you. You... ...poor man's Rimbaud. The first golden age came to be... ...when... - Faster. ...when... This is a classroom and not a race track! Couldn't go any shorter, hmm? I'm sorry, I can't employ you any longer. Your father told the police unbelievable stories... ...about what allegedly goes on in my store. I'm really sorry. Your pay cheque for the rest of the month. That was a solid F. Excuse me. Where are you going? Kindly conduct your amorous affairs during break time! I said sit down! If you leave now, you can't come back! Ruby! That was stupid of me. One scratch and I'll kill you! I don't want to hide anymore. Bite into the apple, Snow White. Do you want to live with dwarves forever? Better to fall than lie in a glass coffin. Kill yourself, you cowardly asshole. What? I've always wanted black eyes. You get away with it. I'll sacrifice my life for you! Did I do something wrong? It's only that I... ...I can't go back. Ever. We could hide out in Berlin. Ruby? I wanted to see if you'd worry. Nasty piece of work. Application for voluntary house of correction... ...enclosed accommodation But not state-run! 70% of all homes are denominational. There are vacancies at St. Vincent's Home, run by the Merciful Sisters. Merciful? Yes... ...merciful. Reason for application... ...threat of sexual waywardness and idleness. Sexual waywardness? The question is whether you can provide your son with adequate parental care. Without any charge against me? A court order is not provided in accordance with § 64 JWG. VEA: Voluntary Educational Assistance is at our sole discretion. Educational assistance is voluntary... when the state guardians apply for welfare education. If I understand you correctly... ...I have the choice... institution or institution. If you could please sign here. The head of the household has to sign. You'll be alright. You're just another fucking yes-man. Martin, I don't have a choice. I won't let you go. We don't have all day. No! No, she's no virgin either. Was it worth it? All your clothes have numbers sewn on. You're number 89 and you're 88. They'll wash out. Sanitary napkins are too good for us. You girls are like white-washed tombs... beautiful on the outside... ...on the inside, just rotting bones, vermin and all that is impure. On the outside you appear pious, but inside... ...you're filled with hypocrisy and insolence towards God. No, I can't dismiss you yet. But Mother, Susanne really made an effort. It's not real remorse... ...lip service! No child, God cannot be fooled! Trust me. You're not ready yet. But when Mother? When? When the white-washed tomb is pure on the inside as well. First letters to parents after 8 weeks. Privileges for good behaviour... ...group outings and permission for visits. Any questions? Only letters to parents? Letters exclusively to the family. Work with us, to attain, with God's help, a new, a better life. Neither I nor my brothers know about your past life. We only judge you for what you do here... You start in group 1. You wear a red hat... ...smoking and talking is strictly forbidden in group 1... ...even outside of work. Hey! Catch up! Move! Faster! Hurry up. What's the matter with you? Group 4 wears blue hats. The boys are close to dismissal, they have gained our trust. We're strict, but fair. We keep book of your offences... ...a new entry loses you points. Insufficient points at the end of the week leads to punishment. What's up? Because of this slacker, no one's allowed to smoke today! Thank this swine of a comrade! Rise! ...forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Sit! The negroes are starving! And you? Eat! Eat! "Freistatt" is a planet with its own laws. You arrive, and you're scum. You're the dregs of the barrel... ...not human. But somehow, everyone wants to be human... ...even if that makes you inhuman. I catch myself, standing around, repeating your name... Like a fool who mutters to himself. Get up! As if she had seen a ghost. Two minutes washroom. Line 12: The... ...righteous have disappeared from the land... ...there is no upright man left among us... ...they are all lurking for blood... The... ...need both hands... ...and there is no upright man left among us. And the judge... You're so clumsy. And what's that? Bed sheets. Insolent girl. I'll check this tonight and I'd better not find any flaws! Dear God... Why don't you intervene? You're silent... ...as usual. Yes. Those who serve you are never alone. Those who forsake you... ...will never be forsaken. Those who take your hand, are never alone. No... I'm not alone. You don't help the others either. Wasting food... ...is a sin! There will be punishment! - Sister, those are mine. - What? Those are mine. Tomorrow, you will fast... ...so you'll learn to appreciate food. And you'll sleep without a blanket tonight! It's all because of my father. I don't even know my father. Mum got a lot of action back then, you know? I think I'm pregnant. How far along? I don't know. I've got to get rid of it... ...soon... You mean... Do I look like a mother? Dear God... What did we do wrong? Doesn't the Bible say that love is the highest commandment? My God... ...I love him. I can't do it alone. Do it, please. I can't... Line 12: The righteous comes... I hope you can iron better than you can read! You! Do not rely on your neighbours. Do not trust your relatives. Protect your secrets from her... ...who lies in your arms. For the son despises the father... ...the daughter rises up against the mother. ...a man's enemies are his house mates. I, however, will look unto the Lord. I will wait for the God of my salvation: My God will hear me. Rejoice not against me, my enemy... ...even if I fall... ...I shall rise again. Get help! Come on, help me! Help yourself. Get water! Water... Water! Are you better? Turn away! Yesterday, someone started singing the "Peat Bog Soldiers" song. Rossmann lost it, because it's a concentration camp song. Whenever he'd turn his back someone else began to sing. Rossmann threatened to punish us all, but in the end we all sang. ...and he couldn't do anything. If this doesn't shine in 30 minutes, you'll be demoted. Is that clear?! Boot licker! You should have let him die like a dog! Rossmann is the worst of them all. Do you know how he got his scar? From an inmate. Tried to stab him. Puny little guy, apparently. Attempted murder at the age of 14. Not bad, huh? What are you going to do after this? Do you have family or anything? Family?! How would you like to be my 'half-man'? Do I have a choice? You can say no. What will this protection cost me? Half of your meat and tobacco... ...and a third of your allowance. Then nobody here can touch you. There are some more extras. Alright...but, no anal. Come here. Get on with it. Go down! You know how it works. Little hustler. Why do you take it? Don't look at me like that! I just want to get out of here in one piece, just like you! God answers those who serve Him... God answers those who serve Him... ...but the wrongdoers' pride passes. Partake in the praise of His name... ...for only His name is heard. St Vincent works hard and thoroughly, and we expect to be paid on time! If this continues, you can look for another laundry service. We are vessels of God, and God will not be mocked. Yes, Mother. We have to be tough... ...even if we feel pity. Precisely because we feel sorry for these creatures... ...we must be strict. Punishing in humility is harder... ...than receiving strokes. You lack seriousness. You're soft. Your fat body is soft from gluttony. We need pillars of strength, but you're pudding. Speaking the truth... ...hurts me more than it does you, Sister. He's your downfall, child. - You have to tell me. I'm not going to talk about him, child. Please! Tell me where Martin is. Don't you want to know how we're doing? Your father has calmed down. Your sister asked to go to high school and he just shrugged. At the beginning, it was hard. We missed your wages, and even had to rent out your room. But now, ...it's fine, because of what I'm earning. I work part-time now! I'll to be out of here soon, Mama. Mother Benedicta has a soft spot for me. The Sisters seem very nice. Nice? When you're here, or someone from the welfare office... then they're nice! Look into their faces! Lying is the only thing we learn! It's all just a show! Why do you always exaggerate? They deny me my right to visit... ...my letters are unanswered... ...and that's supposed to be democracy. It's the law. We act according to the best of our knowledge and conscience. I'm going to file a complaint! We act in the interest of your son. You are free to appeal, of course. Yes, and we will. By the way, Mr Grall... My father's a lawyer and my uncle works in public broadcasting. Just saying... for what it's worth, Mr Grall. One guy arrived, fresh from Staffelberg... and told us about a revolt there. The inmates escape in droves. Rumour has it that communes in Frankfurt and Berlin are taking in refugees. It's started... - Boys! It's my pleasure to introduce a new, young member of staff. A new brother! This is Brother Adolf! Udolf! U! That one letter cost me 100 marks. Silence! A new educator, Brother Udolf... ...is already sucking up to the others, because he's young and less strict. In the end, it makes no difference. An educator stays an educator, ...and education is violence. Here! Drivel, totally biased... To give that waster's father the time of day, it's outrageous! Denying Martin's father his visiting right was perhaps not the best idea. Those hacks! We work our - excuse me ladies - arses off, and then this. Father, we need to make some changes. Changes! More staff, more money, no problem. Do you think I can't come up with any improvements?! Believe me brother, we all started out as idealists. Something in their faces changed. They were getting nervous. You can see it. If you look carefully... ...Freistatt will burn... ...and Germany, too. I spoke with the Episcopal Seminary, and if you pass the aptitude test... ...you'll get a place at high school. One more thing... ...on Sunday, you'll have the honour of being Psalmist. The Monsignor was against it, but I said, Rosemarie is worthy and won't disappoint. My dearest... ...I'm sure now that we'll see each other soon. God hasn't abandoned me after all. Yes... ...God. Don't laugh, heretics. I know he still has plans for us. That pig needs to be taught a lesson. No... ...I'll be fine. We belong together. I know that more than ever. Horst has to go! Do you never have doubts? What? That... ...we only suffer as part of a test. Such crap. What if God wants... Did the penguins shit on your brain or something? Man! I mean... Don't you sometimes think it's all your fault? Otherwise this would never have happened, they couldn't do that to you. When's the holiest moment in these services? The Transubstantiation. And when is that? After the Agnus Dei. That's when they take the wine and turn it into the blood... Can you give me a sign? Why? On Sunday, I'm flying the coop. I'm just waiting for confirmation. Do it harder! Tomorrow's the day! Tomorrow, we'll be free! He'll wait on his motorcycle in front of the- I'm not coming. I felt the baby move! 5th or 6th month. I knew it. You knew, and should have reported it. I didn't. - Yet again! Come with me. Look at me. Did you know? I had to swear by God that I wouldn't betray her. And I was afraid of Sister Martha. Swearing by God is a grave sin. I wasn't afraid for myself, but for Gisela and her child. The child? It was conceived in sin! Gisela would make a fine mother. You can't think she'll be allowed to keep it? Tomorrow, she'll be transferred anyway. Tomorrow? Then she won't be able to go to mass. I'd say she probably doesn't care! But she wanted to hear me sing... ...in the front. Well, she could come to mass first. What are you grinning at, shit head? I'm picking up on your positive vibes, Horst! You feel strong now, don't you? A 'half-man' can soon be a 'dead-man'. If I can't see what he writes, I can hardly answer. It's been forbidden all this time, then all of a sudden... Your deluded father and the public have a right to know how it really is! This is manure! Father, I don't know what you mean? The food is bad? ...a labor camp? And this here! The inmates provide a profit for the ministry? But Father, I thought lying to my dad is a sin. We use violence? You think that's the truth?! Do we not receive 40 'Pfennige' a day? Unless there are deductions! Which is always the case. Again. Does Brother Rossman not carry a gun? And was Freistatt not in the Third Reich a... I should move to group 2, but because I reject the privilege, everyone's irritated. They have no provisions for this. I was instantly demoted again. Which, in fact, doesn't make a difference, Since then... ...they've been particularly vicious. Vicious dogs don't bark... ...they're put to sleep. Father? Yes? - Can I talk to you outside? We've searched everything. Nothing. One of you did it. You! You were cleaning here. I don't do things like that, honestly. You know we have three apprenticeships going. If you show us you deserve it... If you don't talk at once, you will never get out of here! Talk! - He's afraid to say it! It was his protector! Well spit it out, who took the money? Horst! Yes, it was Horst. He steals from everyone. He even steals from the food pantry. Get up! Admit it! No! No! That wasn't me. I swear it. It wasn't me! It wasn't me. It wasn't me, it... ...it wasn't me! Horst. You shouldn't have dragged me into this. I've been in Freistatt for 3 months, and after a rocky start, I have finally arrived. You're probably wondering, what your son does all day. It's certainly not boring here. Our main job is on the moor, for which we are paid fairly. It's hard but interesting work, and it's nice to be out in the fresh air. It strengthens our bodies and makes us productive. Strong... ...not just in the physical sense. My attitude to work has changed drastically in the last 3 months. Most importantly, we've learnt camaraderie and team spirit. Though I miss you very much, Freistatt is a good, worthwhile experience. The hot-headed boy you gave away comes back a man. In terms of faith, I've learned that there's no life without God... And any doubts will soon give way to devoted belief. I embrace you... ...your loving son, Martin. P.S... ...Dear God... ...if you wish to dispel my doubts as to your existence... ...then punish those who humiliate us in Your name... ...and who force me to give false testimony! With a lightning bolt... Silence! Silence! Two days without food or water... ...and you'll sleep on the floor... ...without a blanket! At 17 you dream of love... 10 years later, 1977 ...that turns the world upside down. You hope that it crosses all boundaries... ...and lives on forever! The fire of love is ignited inside us... ...and carries us through the darkness of night! We feel strength, determination... We won't stand still, it's our time! Nobody can separate us now. We're ready far everything! Life is only about love... ...and the one who's yearning for me... Excuse me. This light! Who chose these lights!? I can't see anything! I can't hear anything! I hate this shit! Polydor will make you a star. I'll sing about the island of Capri... ...sailors, Vladivostok... but no Christmas albums with Ave Maria and shit! But why not, my darling? No, forget it! Ruby? It's me, Gisela. We know each other from school. Exactly, from school! How do you manage to put away so much food and keep your figure? Tell me... Do you think about it a lot? It's pointless. What doesn't kill you... My Lord... Where is she? Go on. tell me I don't know, Sister. Where is she? Hands on your back. Over here! You'll have time to think about telling me. I know where you'll find her, Sister. Man, Ruby! What's keeping you? Fuck the past! Exactly What doesn't kill you, right? What did you do when you got out? Went to Ham burg. Hamburg Star club. It hasn't been mixed yet. It was recorded in an hour. I've... I've looked for you everywhere. I knew only that you were out... ...and in Hamburg. I've searched every record store. I'm so predictable. How did you get the car? It's better if you don't know everything. Damn, do you have a light? Yeah, in the glove compartment... ...there should be a lighter. They arrested him two days later. 'Membership in a terrorist organization'. I didn't even go home after my father fell from the scaffolding. The little one got married... ...to someone who used to have a crush on me! Not much choice in that small place. Could you please leave me alone with my dear old friend? Would that be ok? I need to be off anyway. He's alright, actually. He just worries too much. I know what I'm doing. Why don't you stay a little longer? I have to go. Do you really think I enjoyed sending you away? I couldn't go against him. Please be honest, Ruby... - Rosemarie. Did it hurt you? Without the reformatory, would you be there? Where you are now? Did you have a good chat? I've missed you. Getting married at 19? What a crazy idea. I've been in love with him since I was 12. I had to plug away at it. Mostly, because of his parents. They had higher hopes for their son. You know I'm only here for Katja! Hello, Rosemarie. Out! Out! That's bad luck! What do you want? I'm a good match... ...and an outstanding lover. Yes! So, are you still in touch with him? There's no talking to him. If Martin wants to go under, he'll do it thoroughly. He wrote to me from prison... ...that he was sorry and... should we give it another try, or some nonsense. Are you going to visit him? I'm not going to any jail. He's out. He lives here with his father. Ruby. Rosemarie. Man... Coffee? So, how's Granny doing? Granny? I had to put her in a care home, she... was confused and... Father put her in an institution... ...which is what he does when someone causes problems. What's a rising 'Schlager' star doing in our humble abode? Ruby. Don't go. Hard on the outside, soft on the inside. But that's the title of one of your 'hits'. I'll make the music I want. You're still with this slimy guy from Vienna? Schorschi only manages me. That's all. I shouldn't have come here. Ruby, you can't fool me. You won't give it up. I know what I'm doing. I don't wallow in self-pity. I'm glad we split up back in Hamburg. Love alone isn't enough. Love alone... isn't enough. When your life is a nightmare... ...death will be your awakening! When your life is a nightmare... ...death will be your awakening! Wake up! Dream over! Do you know what it's like to have someone on your conscience? There was this boy, Xaver. He knew nothing about life other than... ...taking shit. He only ever lived in homes... ...his entire life. ...and they killed him... ...because of me. Because of you? Yes. They didn't get to me... ...but to him. Pigs. No, I'm the pig. He'd be alive now, he might even be happy. He was tough... Nothing got him down. It's not your fault. You know what happened to him? Horst... ...one of those fascist pigs... ...threw him out a window. It wasn't high. But he fell on a fence... ...and was impaled. Nothing is alright... ...as long as ONE of these pigs is still alive. The worst part is... ...the pigs are everywhere... ...and they call the shots. That's why I always carry this. Rossman's 'Wehrmacht' pistol! You can't change things with violence. Where violence reigns, violence is the only answer. Where violence reigns... ...violence is the only answer. Will you be alright? Yes. Yes! Afraid of tomorrow. Afraid to see you wake up and realize we're strangers again. Afraid of the sentence: 'We'll see each other again.' Afraid of, 'We should give it another try.' In the end, you will return to your world anyway... ...and I to mine, which has been hell for a long time. I should have my own hell for anger... ...a hell for pride... ...and a hell for caresses... ...a whole symphony of hells. I... ...Arsehole! You cowardly arsehole! Ruby. Ruby.
