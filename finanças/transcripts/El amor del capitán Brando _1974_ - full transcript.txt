LOVE OF CAPTAIN BRANDO My grandfather said that... priests and teachers neither went to the toilet nor got naked. - She is really hot. - She is very slim! Look, look. Juanito... What are you doing here? Children! Come in. What a calamity! Sit down! No, over there! Lift your head! If your mother finds out about this, she'll take you into the Augustinians. It's disgraceful what has happened. You wanted to see me naked, didn't you? The bad thing is to do things in secret, like thieves. And spy on people. It stings? Better than getting into trouble! There is nothing wrong with looking at what one likes. Raise your head. My case is different. They on the contrary... What... They say that you're fresh. What do you say about it? No. "Sex education". - What's funny. Don't you need it? You, Quique, to the board. I'm not feeling good, Miss. I see. Someone volunteer? You come up, Blanca. And you, Juan. Blanca is going to draw a naked man. And Juan, a woman. It's done, Miss. There's something under our clothes, isn't there? And what else? An embarrassing incident happened last night. And it's not the first time it has happened. I'd like that never again... The bad thing is not in what you don't dare to draw,.. but in yourselves and your fears. When I was a child I closed these doors. Well now you can't close the doors because cars have to pass. "Fernando, pass the ball, I'm alone!" "Goal!" And it is hereby decreed that from this date forward... access is forbidden by livestock across Real Street. Only Cuestas Street... will be used as a drovers road, today Carlos Prieto Street... - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. A "porrón", please. - Doesn't anyone drink from a "porrón"? - No, Mister. But I don't care, I'll have one myself. Almost nobody drinks from a "porrón". Maybe today in Catalonia, but not here. These lithographs, were like this before? No, they were reformed in '43. Before they were priests. - Thanks. Cheers. - Cheers. I hadn't drunk from a "porrón" since the fall of Barcelona. I'm here. I wish I had come back earlier,.. especially to see you, Mother. - Hello, Fernan. - Hello, Sebas. Visiting your parents' grave? - You are very old. - Just look at you! - Do you remember my boyfriend? - Yes. Too many people died in the war. And how did my mother die? In bed, better than your father. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Sorry, I found the door open and came inside. This was my house. This was the dining room. Over there was a door to go into my grandfather's room. The fireplace was here. Sorry, do you have to stay? This man lived here. Hello, have you had a good trip? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Have you seen our cousins? - It was cold in Madrid? - It's always cold in the winter. Juan, come here! Don't you hear me? Juan! You are always in the clouds! - Did you renew my subscription? - Be carefully because it's crystal. Don't you kiss me? You are not affectionate. Three days without seeing me! - Have you renewed my subscription? - As if I haven't anything else to do! - Why aren't you wearing a hat? - Because he is ashamed. Shame, he should be ashamed of other things! You are going to catch something bad! Have the insurance bills arrived? This morning. - Why don't you do my assignments? - Don't be pain in the neck! Juan. I'm calling you! You never look at what you do! Don't you know things are very expensive! You are all fingers and thumbs! Go out now! Today you get no dinner to learn to be in the world. And you don't slam like the last time because I'll beat you. Has Françoise written? Don't mention that man to me, he is dead. But, has he written? You shouldn't take it out on the child. I try to educate my son properly. Well, give him the letters. One day I'll cut your hair and sell it in Segovia. To Juan, to be read when you grow up, ... with huge affection, from your father, Françoise. If ... Dad ... were alive ... he would be the only... It's me, Aunt Ketty. Open! You know your mother doesn't like you to lock the door... nor that you smoke. - Are you hungry? - No. Well you're going to eat this. - Dad smoked a pipe, right? - Yes. If he was French, what am I? Your mother is Spanish and you were born here. I'd rather be French. I'd rather all of us were French. Why don't you go to Madrid? You could be a model there. - Many girls on TV are less beautiful. - Don't speak nonsense. If you only knew what my classmates think of you. What? What are you doing here in the dark like two conspirators? Didn't I say the child doesn't get dinner? - But... - What is this? "Miss Aurora" Vandals, I'll tell your father! Listen to the atrocities that your nephew wrote. “I love Miss Aurora,.. For her I would leave my house. I would march wherever she would like... as long as I could live always at her side.” It's wrong for you to read his diary. “I like her red lips and her small and round breasts.” This kid is crazy. No longer a child, he's 13, and a man. Do you want him to be like his father? That he be a rascal, like all men. Pardon, does "Negresco" still exist? And "Swiss Coffee"? - When were you last in Madrid, Sir? - 1939. None of that exists anymore. In "Negresco" is Popular Bank and in "Swiss Coffee" is Bilbao Bank. Are you interested in Flamenco? Some show? No, thank you so much. I'm going to my bedroom. - Take me a "carajillo" upstairs. - Ok, Sir. Hello, good morning. Good morning, Aurora. Did something happen? Nothing. Amparo is worried about her son. You know, he is a very excitable boy. Of course she knows, because it's she who excites him. Go kids, don't worry about what's happening here. Does it seem decent that my son draws you naked? And he spends his life thinking dirty thoughts because of you. And you're the teacher of my son. The child is innocent. You provoke him and everyone else. - Don't say absurdities. - Absurdities? Read it here. Have you found him? You should give it to him. I don't need advice to educate my son. What's happened to you, Captain Brando? I find you pensive. Nothing Major Mitchum, memories. Painful memories, maybe. In a way, Major, in a way. I reminisce about my childhood. You know I have foreign blood and I'm a misunderstood person. A misunderstood person, Captain? Don't you give yourself too much importance? Juan! Juan! I've hurt myself! Come here! Sorry, Captain, I'm a weak woman. I twisted my ankle. Now you will have to carry me in your arms. Can you give me that? Have you read it? It's normal what you say there. One needs to fall in love. When I was your age I was in love with a boy much older than me. He ignored me. Poor boy. He ended very badly. He died young, you know. His name was James Dean. He should be an idiot not pay attention to you. Can I ask you a question? What are all those movies you put in the diary? The list of films I've made this year. Now I'm watching this one. It's imaginary. Marlon Brando is the Captain and Robert Mitchum is the Commander. Aren't they a little old for these roles? No! I do all the characters. What is the girl's name? Aurora. Can I play Jane Fonda? Yes. Didn't you have a sprained ankle? Don't trust me ever, I'm dreadful. You are Indian. Speak informally, between partners... You have to hide the dagger under your clothes. Yes, Sir. Captain Brando loves you... and he shouldn't because you are different races. Major Mitchum warns you. And will I betray him? I don't know. In the seduction scene... What? Seduction! You attract him into your tent, and you poison him with your kisses. Then, taking advantage that I can't see, you take the dagger... - Am I evil? - Wait... You can't kill me because you also... ... are in love with the Captain. Yes. - You start. - Ok. - Hello. - Good evening. I have pork chops, ladies underwear. Thanks, I don't need anything. Can you give me a cup of wine? I'm dry. - I haven't any. - I have in the van. - I'll bring a bottle? - No. What's with you? Do you like younger? Do you really want to come in? You'll hear from me again. There is no hurry. You should act because your husband has to take matters into his own hands. I know. - Want 60? - Make it 40, we aren't in festival. After all a mayor is a mayor. He can't do anything. The thing has to come from above. - She makes the children dance. - They call it "corporal expression". Filth. - Modern methods. - If you had children... You think it's decent to name her dog Archangel? - Has the mail come yet? - Not yet, it doesn't arrive until 4 . - When do you go to Segovia? - The 27th. "Miss Aurora..." "... slut". What were you going to put there? You know what that word means? Sit down without making any noise! You think this place is a stable! Come here, you don't! Clean that! Don't move from there until I tell you! You are as guilty as he! Don't ever come to this classroom again! Tell your parents I've expelled you from the school! Extend your arms until we finish! On your knees! Corporal expression. Silence! Miss, Fede is bleeding. Sorry. It's the first time I ever hit someone. I'll never do it again, I swear. Don't cry. Girls are going to laugh at you. - Does it hurt? - No. The class is over. You can go out to the playground. I've received many complaints about you. Reasoned complaints that have credit to me. Before now, I didn't take it into consideration. I am very grateful. If you were a man, I would speak otherwise to you. Imagine that I am. I am busy! You'll have a stomach ache later! Believe it or not,.. here is my Secretary, who won't deny me. I feel a sincere appreciation for you. I want to think someone is advising you badly. Don't think it. Don't forget that children of today are men of tomorrow. And we have lost enough in the war. When you go out close the door, Concha. Priest Jose María will be here this afternoon to snack with you. My duty as first authority... Could you tell me what you are accusing me of? Accusing you? Of nothing. God forgive me. Accuse... the judges. I don't know who. Then why did you call me? To ask you to correct... I'll be a good person. - I'm not laughing. - Me neither. Something else. Miss Aurora! - You left this in the office. - Thanks. Excuse me. Don't pay attention to him. He isn't a bad person ... but you know what it is to be a boss,.. he has to appease everyone. If, in this village, there were a crime I would be the main suspect, right? Not for the inspector. You go on as before. And you know, children of today are men of tomorrow. - Bye, good day. - Good day. - What are you doing there? - I am in my house. I rented it for a year. Would you like to come in? I can't... Spanish history. Come by the school later. I have something for you. What? Surprise. Come in. This must be yours. It's been here 30 years. Watch out! - Are you hurt? - No, I'm not. I was shorter before. The house sideboard. What's that? My co-worker is typing. She's doing notes. My grandfather was very fond of birds. We used to go to band storks. A reminder of the year I entered the seminary. My father. He always read Menendez Pelayo. The first time I fell asleep at mass he made me stay for three more. I was unable to protect him from a stupid personal vendetta. He was executed ... but first, he was dragged by a horse. - Here? - Yes. Look! Nite Formuse, forgive me, the blame is all on the new dance... that it's in fashion on the continent. I've always had a bad sense of hearing. When I was young, I thought I knew English. And do you know it now? Yes. And German, Russian and French. What are you doing here? I prefer a "carajillo". It's made with coffee and cognac. I know. Why don't you come back to the world of the living? It's too late. That's a copout. Yesterday I hit a child and put him with arms outstretched... as if we were in the last century. I don't know that what we learn is useful. You don't think it's the first time I drink this. There is no way to surprise, not even a rural teacher. A little owl. I haven't heard that for a long time. Do you know why I came back? I guess to make up for lost time. For two reasons. To follow the passage of migratory birds in Castilla. And to see you. In addition to the birds I like women very much. Sorry. - Hello. Good evening. - Hello. He comes to ask for forgiveness. Thanks. Do you forgive me? But we're obliged to stay and make it up to you, Miss. I have headache. Come back tomorrow. Tomorrow is holiday. Well, then the day after tomorrow. Besides I have a guest. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. I love Aurora! I love her! More than the love for my country,.. for my regiment and my honor! I love Aurora, I love her! I'm ready to die for her! I say here, in front of this war council! Spying on people is very wrong. No, I do not spy, he went between my birds. Well, you could delete it. Did you know? Of course. Who is the kid? Juan, from the pharmacy. His parents are separated. We delete the tape? If it doesn't have the song of the grouse... It's looking beautiful. Almost everything will be ready by Saturday. I'm giving a party to celebrate it. You are invited. Who else will come? Nobody. I cook badly. It doesn't matter. I cook very well. I've lived cooking for 20 years. I had a restaurant in Amsterdam. I accept with a condition, you have to call me by my first name. It's hard for me. In my times... By my first name or formal? By your first name. - What time? - At 9, European time. I don't want to go. I say it, and enough. But I can't! I have homework to do. You will do it quickly. - I'll go. Where? - He'll go. Just what I need, the kid doing what he wants. And don't think that by measuring yourself, you'll grow faster. Who is it? It's open. I bring this on behalf of my mother. Put it there. In that mortar there are coins. Take a "duro". No, thanks. Bring me the corn flour, please. - Would you like a glass of wine? - I don't drink. Wrong. - You're Juan, aren't you? - Yes. - Do you know who I am? - Yes. Give me that bottle, please. It would have been better with Burgundy. - Do you always cook? - Only in exceptional cases. I invite you to dinner. A friend of yours will come, Aurora. I know. - Did she tell you? - No. Are you staying? - Are you two together? - Do I have boyfriend face? Others are. - Would you mind chopping this onion? The other day both of you went up to the attic. It's known? Nothing happened. - Do you promise me? - Sure. But call me by my first name. "Sir" is for old men. Can I ask you a question? - About sex and stuff? - No, about politics. - Are you a Red? - What do you understand by "Red"? Well, those from the civil war... - Are we friends? - Yes, we are. May the best win. It's bad luck to toast with water. Can women drink a toast? Cheers. It has been a memorable dinner, gentlemen. - Anything happening? - No, nothing. Fernando went into Berlin with the Russians. He was Russian and had a real tank. He was a lieutenant and never raped anyone. It isn't true. Women aren't interested in themes of war. It's stuff for men. Both of you are complete idiots. - Liqueur? - A drop, please. Don't worry, I'm a gentleman. - What are you playing? - He is amazing. He was also in Stalingrad. Do you smoke? He is only a cook. We shouldn't speak badly about someone who isn't here. You are also fantastic, even though you've never been to Berlin. Does your mother know you're here? You have to go back home. Coffee and liqueurs are served in the library. Juan must leave. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - Can I come back to your home? - Sure, whenever you want. Will you go to sleep soon? Don't worry. I'll say I have headache. - Good bye. - Good bye. - Do you plan to stay in the village? - For now, yes. - Are you going to open a restaurant? - No, not now. It wouldn't be a bad business. Did you bring all this stuff from your house in Amsterdam? Yes, I did. Almost everything. - Truly, did you enter Berlin with Russians? - Yes, I did. - Didn't you tell Juan to impress him? - No, I didn't. - And didn't you rape anyone? - I don't remember. But have you had German lovers? Here you will get bored a lot. You never say what you think? That boy is fantastic. You have to be careful with him. What else? I have shame. About what? To be old. Forgive me. I'm not feeling good, you know? I have a headache. - Can I walk with you? - No, I prefer to walk alone. Damn dog of shit. He is a fantastic guy. I think it's great to have met him. I thought you were sleeping. - Have you had dinner yet? - Yes. - Where? - At Fernando's house. - Could you have notified us? - Sorry. "Diary" Are you scared of me? It's my fault, isn't it? Why do you imitate your father's handwriting? Do you remember much about him? If you had been a girl we'd understand each other much better. - But I'm a man. - Worse for you. Why? Such a vicious thing and so useless? Tell me. I know Lazaro was only a dog. Forgive me. I shouldn't cry. What are you doing here! I'm fed up with you following me around! Get out! Girls, go home. You know I'm a grandmother again. Mari Pili has given birth to a calf. Congratulations. - Would you take a drink to its health? - Ok. I'm going to name it Jose Luis like my boyfriend, may he rest in peace. What happened to you? Do you have to leave again? One thing that is always the same... people. And that surprises you? People are always people. Silence, silence! Hear me! Look at this! Over there is the devil, in that alcove! And do you see that hole in the stone, there the devil put his hand. Do you know how long it took to build this bridge, or aqueduct. One night. Is anything wrong? You can go to the International Army,.. there you will find Gary Cooper or catch Moby Dick. If you have luck you can enroll with Gregory Peck. And do you know why? To lose the men and separate them from the right way. You must think about the legend deeply. The aqueduct was built by Roman engineers and Segovian workers... carrying stones during several months in the Trajano era. That was a thousand years ago. Enough is enough of superstition and nonsense. You are making a fool of yourself. I don't want to get into what I don't care ... but I give you advice from a friend and companion,.. he is not good for you at all. Besides he is old ... he has a political past. No one knows what he has done before. The girls like tall boys but not so much, good-looking, with blue eyes,.. and some physical defect, like Duanel. And his occupation, psychiatrist in first place and priest in second place. That was imprudent in the attic the other day. - Have you told anyone? - No, I haven't. Kids! In row! Can't you let them have one day of freedom? And I tell you that he is married! The telephone operator told me. Later we are going to do the girls' vote. Have you seen him? - Could you wait a moment, please? - We are late. We’re missing a child. 10 minutes. I earn a punctuality bonus. - When is there another bus? - Tomorrow at 8. Go back with the children, I'll go back tomorrow. - Do you have money? - You are making a mistake. Am I guilty too? I'm not. - Hello. - Hello. How did you know I was here? Because I'm a witch. I had no desire to return either. - Do you have money? And what did you think you were going to do? I guess your mother will forget you. Time fixes everything. Can you forgive me? I have behaved badly with you, but I want to continue being friends with you. Do you want to come back to town? There will be a bus tomorrow at 8. We have to spend the night here. No! - Are you afraid? - It seems silly to you. But it's a lie, it's a movie. Dracula has always scared me. I read it when I was your age. He said you can invite him mentally to come into your bedroom. And when I was alone in the darkness I thought, "Dracula, come in." And I couldn't stop thinking about it. That's morbid. Do you know what morbid is? Twisted and weird. My mother says I'm morbid. Don't listen. You're a great guy. - Do I add water? - No. Take care. You don't have to be afraid of ghosts. Many smart people are. I can take a lot. - My mother is very lonely? - And you're asking me? Do you love her? She has suffered a lot with my father's death. They were in love. I understand what happens to her. To the gentleman, please. Thank you. Leave a tip. You're very kind. I really appreciate it. And couldn't you come right now? A taxi is too expensive. Not worth it. - Juan has gone up to sleep. - Until tomorrow, then. I'm sure she's done it on purpose. The things you say. - How much do single rooms cost? - 180 pesetas. - And double rooms? - 285 pesetas, all with bath. - A double. - Can you give me your I.D. card? - Yes. - Do you need my brother’s I.D. card? - No, I don't. this's enough. - Do you want me to sign here? - Yes. Come in. - What were you playing this morning? - Votings. The guys vote for which guys we think the girls would like... and the girls do the same. And for favorite occupations. - And what was the result? - The girls? - Yes. Chubbies, a little fresh, and with blue eyes. - And are you agreed? - No. - Take off your clothes. - I'm not sleepy. We have to get up early tomorrow. Undress and get into bed. - Really I'm not sleepy. - Juan, you're making me nervous. - And what kind of occupations? - Artists, teachers, flight attendants. Do you know I have lied twice because of you? I really don't like lying. Are you still like this? Open your eyes! And don't be silly! How important is that you and I sleep together? You are a child! What have you believed! Always thinking of odd things! Forgive me. The fault is mine. - Yes. - It's 7.30. Thanks. Why didn't you tell me you are married? I don't know. Is it important? - What is your wife’s name? - Judy. We are separated. She doesn't want to divorce me. - Do you have kids? - Yes. Two. They don't speak Spanish. I sometimes think I don't speak it either... and that I wasn't born here. I leave tomorrow. Running away from someone? I'll be at the capitol. - Are you making suggestions? - I have to fix documents. I'll be back on Friday or Saturday. Maybe you'll have to do military service. - They are going to miss you at the procession. - Better. You know how villages are. People talk and talk, without bad intention. Aurora is incapable of doing anything wrong. She should have been a professional to fulfil her position. But each to their conscience. Don't be worried about him. It's absolutely normal what is happening. Of course children are very delicate. When I was a child the festival was in summer. There were fighting bulls. Both of you will have to dance with me this afternoon. Juan! Go home right now! The Mayor from Tres Cabañas, Segovia, sends greetings to Aurora Silva Cortón and... informs her she is temporarily relieved from her school responsibilities. I preferred to bring it to you myself. Don't worry too much. It will surely be a tempest in a teapot. You shouldn't go to school today. It's not diplomatic. I'll take care of your group. Provisionally, of course. Like if I were the Mayor. - If you want advice... - I need no advice. I'm waiting for an explanation. Explanations in my office, Miss. Ask for a date. I will complain to the inspector, the Governor. Precisely I'll see the Mr. Governor on Sunday at a hunt. I think I'll inform him. You have no right to separate me from the school. No? I'm who makes the law here. We'll see. Don't be standing there, Concha, you make me nervous! Get out! Fuck! - Why do you get involved in what you don't care about? - What don't I care about? - Children of today... - I know! Are men of tomorrow! You corrupt them. There are signed complaints. Who have I corrupted? Don't play innocent! You managed to stay with a child in Segovia... and spend the night with him! And you said he was your brother. Here things are known! I! I've saved you from going to jail, for you to understand. You should be grateful to me! I don't want to take this seriously. Let's go inside. We've already spent half an hour. Besides you're going to catch cold. You're not from our classroom. - Juan, I'm going to tell your mother. - I don't care. Are you playing the hero? I'll give you one minute. Where are you going? You’re from my classroom! It's a strike. We won't go inside until Miss Aurora is here. Are you crazy? What will you get for this? A punishment! Miss Rosa, why was Miss Aurora expelled? Because she treats us like grown-ups and it's not of interest to them. They prefer that we not think. Well said! - Please, kids, don't do that. Have I ever treated you badly? It's not my fault! I fulfil my obligation! Miss Aurora is my workmate and I love her a lot but... It is the most beautiful thing that ever happened to me in my life. But I don't like others to fix my problems. Also they are mine. The fault is my mother's, isn't it? Not at all. Apparently, the fault was mine. I'm going to Madrid. With Fernando. He's an old man. I thought you two were friends. I'm going too. I will work for you. What kind of woman do you think I am? I have a profession. Anyway, I'm going with you. We would be an odd couple, don't you think so? Not as much as others. If the others don't want to study, let them. When they are older they will regret it. Today's lesson is about hygiene. The most important hygienic rules are: do physical exercise outdoors,.. showering with warm water, avoid tight clothing, alcohol, tobacco. Get out! Traitors! Fags! - You don't expect the police to take part in this. - And who then? But they're children. They throw stones. The Civil Guard is for more serious things, miss. Don't you know that a child was the first to break a window... at the palace of Louis XVI in the French Revolution? Really!? Haven't you seen the graffiti that children draw everywhere? - They are going to kill her? I don't know. - Are you leaving? - Only for a few days. - You've always done that. - Why do you say that? - I had to leave then. - I see. There were two States. Aurora! Aurora! You don't have any other choice but to talk to them, Mr. Mayor. Come out, Mr. Julio! They are calling you. - It's ridiculous. They are children! - So what? You've never spoken in public? Maybe the Governor will find out about it. Children need good advice. You can't deny them advice. Mr. Julio! Mr. Julio! Dear schoolchild from Tres Cabañas. Neighbors and brothers! And Aurora! Miss Aurora! Your Mayor is proud of your behavior! Bring me my coat. And your enthusiasm in your homework! - What homework? - I don't know. I promise you advice and guidance! But you must promise me loyalty and obedience! Because we are law-abiding citizens and we know how to respect each other! Let's leave stories and let's talk frankly, without deceit! What deceit? Considering that throughout the year the behavior of youth has demonstrated obedience and a behavior change about the provisions issued by the mayor! Whereas the neighborhood in general has contributed and follows the same line and how has demonstrated his concern about matters of the municipality reigning unity, peace and concord! Resulting that measures from the Mayor can reward or punish who, on the facts, deserve it! Aurora! We want to Miss Aurora! Considering you are men of tomorrow! I promise you that we'll do justice to Miss Aurora and we'll act accordingly! And considering your loyalty to the magisterium on behalf of this town, and in attribution of my position I grant you a week of holidays. Come back! And now what do you think to do, Captain Brando? To die, Major. It's possible that the guard isn't very attentive today and it's very likely there will be a horse behind the fence. Thanks, Major, but I don't want to escape. What for? She wouldn't be with me. She has betrayed me. Our love is impossible. I prefer to die. What time is the execution? At sunset. - Is there class, Miss? - No. Go play. Dear parents, I would send love, and hope you receive... this letter and find you all well. I'm fine, thank God. María Rosa? At the seminary as usual. The food is plentiful but worse than home. Is that you? Who's there? Hello. - Open that door. - What for? Are we going out? Don't be prissy. We all know that you spent the night with the child. Get naked, as you do at home. Do you think I'm a kid from school? Don't be a puritan with me. Do you remember the dog? Undress or you won't leave here. Let me... I can't move. How do you want me to get naked? Let me, please. Isn't it cold here? As you wish. When will you come back? You won't ever come back, right? Are you going to look for me? I have to fix things. I'll come back very soon. - Hello. - I was passing nearby. - And the revolution? - A farce. The rebels were integrated into the system and... reactionary groups suggested that there was an undesirable element. - You've given up. - No, I go to the Delegation. - Now? You have little idea of their workings. Today is Saturday. - Where do you live? - Don't feel responsible. At my cousin's home . She allows you to come back late? I can try. I watched my first film at this cinema. "Mystery of the Wax Museum." I didn't go to the movies until I was grown-up. - It was named Cine Belusia. - Now it's named Blue. - It is also a coincidence. - Shall we go in? No, I prefer a walk. I'm not useful for anything. I'm out! Besides, I'm a coward. I should stay with you. This country seems different to me. Nothing that I knew exists now. Don't speak nonsense. Do you think its nonsense? - Is "The Sun" still published? - What? Give me "Now". - "Print", "Chronic", "World Chart". - Are you laughing at me? No, no sir. Not one brick is still here from this neighborhood. - When? - The civil war. You don't know the war I'm talking about... Why are you always thinking about the same things? I'll take you home? You see how everything's the same? When a couple is kissing... people turning around to look, as ever. - No, they look because I'm old. Time is an abstraction. I have known many older children, and vice versa. I recognize the time when I look in the mirror. I love you. Thank you, Major Mitchum. It's your obligation. I bear you no malice. You're a great guy. No! Don't bandage my eyes. I want to die watching the platoon. Major Mitchum, will you convey a message? Tell her that I die because I betrayed my country... but I never rejected her love, although she denounced me. I know it's not regulation, but could you tell her this with smoke signals? Say goodbye to the boys of the Seventh Cavalry. Ask them to try to forgive Captain Brando. Major, can I order the firing-squad? Platoon! Load! Aim! Fire! - Get out. - Do you want take a drink? I want to go up to your room. Come in. - Have you brought many girls here? - It's prohibited. Well, they didn't say anything to me. Sorry for this mess. Order champagne. Now? I don't see you as a priest. I read a letter you’d written at the seminary. Dear parents, I would send love, and hope you receive... Please send a bottle of champagne. To room 231. - What brand? - French, naturally. Moet & Chandon. - You know a lot about champagne. - It's my profession. Are you afraid? Yes. Me too. Do you want me to leave? Yes, please. Well, I'm not going to listen to you. This village seems empty without you. Don't get scared. - What's happening to you? - Nothing. No woman is worth it. All women are wicked. Your mother wants to see you. Please. What do you want? To talk to you. You haven't talked to me for three days. I was going to bed. Come here. Did you eat dinner ok? Sit down. One day we will take a trip, you and I, alone. Maybe abroad. Do you want anything more? Yes. She is very important to you? - What happened in Segovia? - Nothing. - Did you sleep with her? - No. You know what that means? "Sleep with a woman?" You can't understand it. She is the most amazing person in the world and you've thrown her out. I would also like someone to love me like this. When she returns to the village I will ask her forgiveness. Is that okay? - She will never return. - You never know. Give me that box. Please. It was your father's. I gave it to him. You're grown up. Don't lose it. Are you ashamed to talk? I don't have too much experience in these things. I have. I want to stay with you. I am not so bad. And in five years, what would happen? All will be the same. And in five years more? - It's too late. - Then why did you let me come up? I didn't want it. Forgive me, Aurora. I'm selfish. I don't want to get it wrong more times. You don't know the effort it costs me to tell you this. I love you, too. Don't worry. - Are you going back to the village? - Yes. Will you? Forgive me, Aurora. Are you waiting for someone? Who? Wanna play doctors? If you want, we could go to the hermitage and you give me an injection. Your mother coming? Here all is the same. Well, we have gone back to class... and Captain Brando has been executed. - Are you going to stay? - Where do you want me to go? Everything has been resolved, Juan. I'll never leave the village. Also Fernando has returned. Last week we were marking storks. Yesterday we were talking about you. Well, everyday we talk about you. You are amazing, Aurora. Juan, come! To Pedraza (Segovia) and everybody who lives there.
