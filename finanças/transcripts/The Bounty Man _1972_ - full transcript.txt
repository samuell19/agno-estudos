[waves crashing] [suspenseful music] [horse neighing] Looks like we outran him. Let's go. [horse neighing] [man panting] Water! [gunshot] [gun cocking] All right, what's it gonna be? In the saddle or across it? - [gunshot] - [gun cocking] Get rid of that gun. Come on out here. Three days! Three days a-runnin' us to ground like animals. You lousy bounty hunter... [groans] You wanna talk to me, you call me Kinkaid.

Mister! Whiskey. I'd like it some time today. Name's Angus Keough. No need to trade names, you're Kinkaid. We've been huntin' Gault, too. Where'd you find him? The nations. Ah, just shows the difference between you and us. You'd ride right into limbo to get your man. Good lesson to us! We quit, Kinkaid there keeps right on goin'. We got no ambition. $50 bounty on some reservation runaway Indian? That's been our style. Enough to buy beans and a nice drink. No ambition. $500 out in that hitchin' post. That sort of money'll buy a nice and full dinner... a clean bed... women in perfumed dresses. [chuckles] You must be a rich man. How about buyin' us all a drink? No. What's the matter? Too good to drink with us? I don't even like the idea of talkin' with you. [smack] I don't like the way you lookin' at me. Like I'm some kind of a varmint that just... climbed out of a splatoon. Take your hand off my gun. Not 'til you have a drink with us. Not 'til you slop with the pigs. [punch thuds] [gun cocking] [groaning] Let go of it. I guess you don't wanna drink with us. Kinkaid! Maybe you're livin' a little bit high on the hog, but we're all still swimmin' in the same swamp. You've got a frying sized-- Rufus! We don't want trouble in this town. No man's gonna knock me down, walk over me... and not look back! He just did, like spit on a dirt road. You'll get your chance. Now, go have a drink. [Rufus] Give me a whiskey. - Gault? - Gault. 500 dollars. He was ridin' with a man named Pike. Yeah. I take it he's dead. Self-defense. He wasn't worth anything, so I put him in the ground. Come with me, Gault. You lookin' for another kill? It's a living. Hangmen say the same thing. You know... Gault's been tried and found guilty. He'll hang in the mornin'. Take this over to the bank. Kinkaid'll give you your money. - You know how that works. - Yeah. Bring him in, you can retire. Last heard of Riddle, he's down in the Indian territory. Lot of men gone lookin' for him. Both law and your kind. Most of 'em come back with nothing but saddle sores. A few of 'em didn't come back at all. Ended up coyote meat. [dramatic western music] May God have pity on Billy Riddle if you find him. Coffee, Gault? Tom? Kinkaid, you old bear! - How about a drink? - Sure. Hey, last I heard, you was looking for Red Gault. Yeah, and I found him. - How's it goin'? - [chuckles] Ever try scratchin' your head with an empty shirt sleeve? [chuckles] There you are. I know it sounds loco... But I didn't start livin' 'til Jack Crow bushwhacked me with that buffalo gun. I had to turn to something else. I got me this place, got me a woman... Her father's a medicine man. Hard man to bargain with. She cost me a good horse and a rifle. But... she's worth it. You got a good horse and rifle, Kinkaid? I ain't really at it. Uh-huh. You'll run into your Jack Crow one of these days. I see a lot of men ride through here, Kinkaid. Some runnin'... Some huntin'. - Billy Riddle... - Aha! Well, here there's some that make him out a hero. Say he turned outlaw 'cause he was forced into it. They even singin' songs about him down around Texas. But he'd shoot his own father in the back just for a chow. Any idea where he's holed up? No, but I know a fella that does. Kinkaid... it's a lot easier to grow skin than it is to buy it. Who is he? You got more stubborn than a two-headed mule. He's a snake-blooded weasel named Hargus. He deals with Riddle and his kind. Takes the men supplies and trades with 'em. Hey... I got a friend here... I want you to take along with ya. Sleep with it, keep one eye open... keep your ear on the ground... It's quite a gun. I really appreciate that, Tom. Well... I think I'll be making tracks, you know how it is. Thanks for everything. - I'll see you on the way back. - I hope so. That gun means a lot to me. Kita. Help me roll up these hides. [upbeat western music] It's just like the sheriff said. He's going after Riddle. [laughing] 5,000 dollars! [laughing] Well, how do you know for sure? Give us a drink! He's got a poster of Riddle in his pocket... he's loadin' up with supplies... A nanny cook could put that all together. Riddle's holed up down the territories. Man's gotta be a few bricks short of loco to go ridin' down there. No need to fret. Kinkaid will take care of that for us. And we take Riddle from him. That's right. Well, let's make track. There's no need to hurry. Tully's got an eye on him. Give Kinkaid a good head start. You know, a cougar makes his kill clean. Because he waits for it. [contented sigh] - [door slams open] - [woman screams] [in Spanish] Oh my God! You can't just come in here killin' folk! - [woman screams] - [man groaning] [gun cocking] Why me?! When I'm killing liars, I don't play favorites. Now, you say the right words, you might live 'til mornin'. Where's Billy Riddle? Where is he? - Battle Mountain! - You do business there? - Yeah! - You do business with Riddle? Yes! [panting] He asks me to bring him some tobacco and... ammunition and... and a new dress for his girl. You got 'em? Yup. Where'd you get a new dress out here? - [gun cocking] - [panting] Some folks passin' by in a wagon. The lady had a whole trunk full. We're gonna deliver that dress. [panting] Yeah. A year ago... I was drinking fine brandy in the St. Louis casino. Goes to show you how fast a man can backslide. You're still living in the past. [man whistling] Riddle's in Battle Mountain. Kinkaid's going there now. He's got a man called Hargus with him. How do you know that? Hargus's woman. Battle Mountain, you know it? Yeah, we'll be getting there along by dusk. Now, come on, Rufus! Make us some coffee a man can drink. [pot clangs] [suspenseful music] [Kinkaid] Rein up! Ho, ho... How much further? It's just up around that bend. Give me the layout. It ain't much to give it, just a little spit in the road. Used to be a gold town 'til the diggin's run out. Now just... for men on the run. No mayor, no law, no nuthin'. 3 minutes, bounty man. 3 minutes. That's about how long you gonna last in there. [laughs] Where will I find Riddle? In the saloon, same place as everybody. - Get off the wagon. - Huh? Off of the wagon. [man groans] [suspenseful music] [cheerful music playing nearby] [commanding horse] [horse neighing] - [cheerful music] - [people cheering] - Billy Riddle? - What do you want with him? Hargus sent me. End of the hall. Room on the left. [knocking] Billy here? Who's askin'? Hargus sent me. Let him in. Why didn't Hargus come? He had some trouble. You got something for me? [gasps] Oh... Oh, Billy, it's so beautiful! [laughs] Mm! Thank you! [smooching] - It's gorgeous. - [Billy] It sure is. I think that means we gotta go someplace fancy, maybe, eh, St. Louis? - Hmm? - You mean that? Sure, I mean it! Right after the next job. [Woman] You always say that. Yeah, but this time I mean it. Come on! Go get the man a drink. He's had a long, hard ride. Get goin'! - [gun cocking] - Hold it. Give me your gun. Put the belt on. You're no badge-toter. That's for sure. Bounty hunter? The reward must've gone up. It was $3,000. Now it's $5,000. Five? Thousand? I told you I was goin' up in the world. Holster. Try anything before I get him out of here, I'll kill him. Come on. You scum! Lock it. You're runnin' a bluff. If I were you, I'd set that scatter gun down and get out! One more word and I'll blow you right into next week, now, come on. Help! [banging on door] Somebody let me out of here! Wait a minute. - Help! Help! - Wait a minute. Riddle? Buy me a drink! Mae? [Man] Back away from the door! Billy! Billy! Would you stop that man? He's got Billy! Look, please, listen to me! That man is a bounty hunter! He's got Billy! - Billy? - Yes! Well, come on! Let's go get Billy! [Mae] We're coming, Billy! - [gunshot] - [people screaming] [gunshot] [gunshot] [Kinkaid] Hyah! Come on. ["Bounty Man" playing] [suspenseful music] I told you they'd run you down. [horse neighing] I can get just as much for you dead as I can alive. So you better keep quiet. [commanding horse] [Mae yelling] No! Billy, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine now. You're a bit crazy to come all this way... all by yourself. I'm sorry, but I couldn't get anybody to come with me. Stay away from him. Come on, we're ridin' out. - What about Mae? - She's coming with us. Why? There's no bounty on her. If I don't take her with us, she'll be doggin' our trail all the way. Now, come on. Ugh, where's that Tully? He's been gone a spell. He'll be comin' as soon as he got something to report. - Now, sit down and take it easy. - You keep saying that! All I want is Kinkaid in my sights. I'd say you're a slow learner, Rufus. [whistling] He's got Riddle. Did you see him? I seen him, just at the first sun. He's ridin' hard. Sit a spell, rest your horse. There's $5,000 worth of carcass out there just for the takin'! Rufus, you've been steamin' like a hungry dog on a leash! You're getting on my nerves. I'm figuring this, now, you quit mouthin' in! All right, you're callin' it. [scoffs] It ain't nothing under that hat but hair. [giggles] [smack] Tully! There's a waterhole about 20 miles north. Only water between Battle Mountain and Big Spring. Kinkaid is gonna need water. We'll wait for him there. [upbeat western music] Billy! - Thank you. - Sorry. One swallow, Riddle. Here you go. Okay? - All right? - Thanks. - Billy, what are we gonna do? - I dunno. I-- I wanna help you. I don't want you gettin' hurt. Look, I promise, I won't get hurt. Mm, honey, when a man looks at you... You just be nice to him. That's all. I mean, he's a man, too. Get him to drop his guard. Let's go. All right, water your horses! Make camp up that draw. Don't wanna hang out any signs that Kinkaid can read. [sighs] When he comes in... Leave in the south. - You're warmin' to this. - Hmph! Tracking a man it's a... a challenge. [sighs] You know, Keough... Riddle ain't exactly jelly. What if Kinkaid can't hold him? Driskill, you've been living in a dung heap so long... you've forgotten what faith is. You're late breakin' the news. [coyote howling] Well, now we've had ourselves some supper... and some nice hot coffee... and a sip of water. What now? Some cards, maybe? Oh, it'd be kind of difficult, huh? How about a li'l party to socialize? You know who I am, you met Mae, but who are you? I've been asking myself that question all day long. Who would have guts enough to ride into Battle Mountain and take me like a side of pork? And you know something? I come up with the same answer everytime. There's only one man who'd come in there. Kinkaid. [sighs] We got ourselves about the biggest funeral-giver ever. Shoulda figured it. You ridin' in there, bold as winter. What are you talking about? When he goes after a man, not many get to face a judge. Most of 'em get themselves killed along the way. Cheaper not to feed 'em, huh? Well, I don't need much, Mr. Kinkaid. Honest. Why don't you just shut up and go to sleep? You heard him, honey. Goodnight. Kinkaid? I got a cramp in my leg, I wonder if I could stretch it. [suspenseful music] You know, if you kill Billy, you're gonna have to kill me, too. Well, you speak right up, don't you? Is that true? About all those other men? It's happened. They called it. They called it?! You don't even care, do you? Well, you listen to me... I love Billy and I will do anything for him! That takes in a lot. Anyway you slice it, he's not worth it. You don't know him! When I met Billy, I was in El Paso. Working in a saloon. And one day, he said to me... "No more saloons." And he kept his word. And that was two years ago! Two years spent waiting. Maybe... but I... [sighs] I always knew that there... would be a better life for us somewhere... away from guns and saloons... [sobs] Billy is not like the rest! In two years you haven't learned much, have you? Go to sleep. [upbeat western music] Thank you. - What's the matter with you? - You. Last few days I see a part of you that I don't like. Well, excuse me for not being myself, but that man's taking me in to die. - Mae. - Hmm? Darlin'... In 3 days, we're gonna be in Big Spring. The day after that... they're gonna have a rope dance with me as the guest of honor. And that's in 3 days. You already put a pretty good dent in him. You mean last night? That didn't mean anything. Mm-mm. You're doing fine. Go talk to him. Get him to trust you. He's bound to drop his guard. When he does, I'll be ready. Go on, honey. [suspenseful music] [Keough] Driskill, I tell you, your coffee-- [Driskill] You don't have to drink it. [horse neighing] [Tully] Put the guns down, it's Tully! [Keough] Give him a good rub. [Tully] Just like you called it! Headin' right this way. Except he's not alone anymore. Huh? Got a woman with him. Huh, that's something he didn't call. How are we gonna divvy her up? Where'd you see 'em? Couple miles this side of Shiny Point. That means they'll be here tomorrow. Sometime between noon and dusk. Santana. Camp yourself out on that ridge out there. You see anybody comin', let us know. The rest of you, get some sleep. Got a big day tomorrow. [grunts] [suspenseful music] [Billy] Mae, time's runnin' short. If I hang... you know where that's gonna leave you? Back in some drilled down saloon. - Billy, I tried. - Well, you gotta keep trying. Talk to him. Get close. You gotta do it now. See that knife of his? You get hold of that knife or something to cut me free. Now, it's either that... or me hangin'. [sighs] You know, that dress... it's an awful pretty dress. I wanna see you wear it in St. Louis. [dramatic music] [Mae] Could I just have a cup of coffee? [Kinkaid] You got folks? My father was a preacher. [scoffs] Religion's supposed to save your soul but I guess with me it was the other way 'round. My father's kinda religion, anyway. [Kinkaid] What kind was that? We were Quakers. And that was a really strict kind of life, and then my father became a deacon... and he changed... and so did our religion. He started to see sin in everything. People, love... We'd always dress really plainly and then, even that became sinful. He made me wear my hair... very severe and hidden... because no boy should see my hair. And, after a while, I wasn't even... allowed to see any boys. When I broke one of his rules... of sin... then he whipped me. So my life... came down to his church and my room... and nothing in between. And I hated it. Then I started to hate him. So you ran away? I was 18 and I didn't even know if I was pretty. Then, one day, I... tried on a friend's party dress and I combed down my hair... [sighs] And then my father caught me admiring myself in the mirror. And he burned the dress... and he cut off my hair... and he whipped me with the bull whip. And that was the last I ever saw him. [dramatic music] [Kinkaid] How'd you meet Billy? I was green and I drifted... And I managed to survive and then I ended up in Durant. I was at the bottom of the barrel until Billy came along. That was better than where he took you? We were gonna go to Oregon. Get married and have kids... Billy's an outlaw, I know that. But it's not his choice. He was forced into it? Yes! Yeah, they were all forced into it. I know Riddle, I've known 20 of 'em. When his hide's at stake, he'll throw you to the wolves. Quit him while you still got something left to give. [suspenseful music] - [pots clanging] - [Mae groans] [gun cocking] [Kinkaid] It's empty. Now, put it back. [horse neighing] I told you he'd threw you to the wolves. You chanced killing me! He wouldn't kill you. Now, Kinkaid might be a lot of things, but he wouldn't kill a woman. [relieved sigh] You counted on that? Honey, if I thought there was a chance of you gettin' hurt... Mae, I love you. [dramatic music] They're comin'! They made better time than I figured. Get that fire out! Hide the horses! What are you waiting for? We need water! Something flushed those doves. Coyote or sumthin'! They stay out of the heat and wait 'til it's cool. [suspenseful music] What are we gonna do? Ride around it? I'd like to, but we're dry. You're spooked. Maybe. What's wrong with you? Over a couple of stinkin' birds? What about Mae? She needs a drink. I don't like it. We're getting outta here, come on! Ride up and don't miss 'em! [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] - [Mae] Billy! - Leave her! Leave her! [horse neighing] Slipped us, but not again. They're out of water and short one horse. Now, let's go! [gunshots] [dramatic western music] [gunshot] [gunshots] [Billy groans] - Whoa! - [gunshot] Get the horses back to the rocks! [gunshots] - [gunshots] - [gun cocking] Riddle, get the horses! Follow the girl! [gunshots] [gun cocking] - [gunshots] - [gun cocking] [gunshot] [gunshots] - [gun cocking] - [gunshot] [gunshots] [suspenseful music] Get 'em up high in the rocks! [gunshots echoing] Back there. Take 'em back there. [gunshot] We got 'em treed. There's nothing but sheer drop on the other side of that hill. We got ol' jokes and whiskey, now, all we need is a woman. Wonder if she dances. - Well, sit tight. - How come? Kinkaid. You seen the way he works that rifle? Try taking him now he'll cut us down like... like summer wheat. They're not goin' anywhere. [dramatic western music] Are you all right? No! I'm not all right. You were gonna leave me back there. - Mae, I-- - Lookit... I followed you all the way from Battle Mountain because I cared! And-- You don't care about anything but your own hide. Mae, you got it wrong. - I panicked! - No, Billy, no! Can I help? Get my saddlebags. Billy, you stay put! - This one. - Okay. There's a bandana and some whiskey in there. [dramatic western music] Who's this? It's my son. Where's his mother? She's dead. There you go. Thanks. - Get some water. - Hold this. What in the pig slop are you doin'? Plugging it up. Stops the bleedin'. It's my last jar, too. Him or them. I'm meeting a blade either way. Mae... I seen how he looks at you. It's the same way I look at you. He is a lonely man. You... you mean that... you want me to... If you have to. Mae, if you don't, I'm dead! You too, rightly! Those wolves aren't gonna leave any witnesses behind. Only way for you and me is to double back to Battle Mountain. We can't do that with Kinkaid in the way! I was a tramp when you found me. And now you're telling me that you want me to be that again. I'm sayin' it's the only chance we got! [gunshots] All right. Now, which of you can do any better? [gunshots echoing] This is the last of the beef. Sorry there's nothing to wash it down with. - What about you? - I'm not hungry. Thank you. Go on. Here. [dramatic western music] When did you stop livin'? Well, you must have felt something once. Love or something. I've been watching you, I've seen it. Now you're just like a... [outlaws yelling cheerfully] [gunshots echoing] Those men out there are gonna kill you. Even brave men don't wanna die but you don't even feel. Why? Why you askin'? Because... I wanna know. How old is your son? He's seven. - What's his name? - Clay. Why aren't you with him? You don't waste any words, do you? Nope. I had a ranch in Colorado. And a wife. Clay was two then. It was then a fella by the name of Paxton... got arrested robbing the general store. Claimed he was hungry. The judge was a friend of mine. Asked me to give him a job. Kind of lend him a guiding hand. Paxton was a lot like your Billy Riddle. Good looking, silk tongue... likable along with it. He'd been there about two weeks when I had to go to... Louisville to buy some horses. I was gone four days. When I got back, he was gone. So was my wife. I went after. I had no idea where they went, so... it took me some time. One day, I rode into this little trail town and... and asked around. She was there, but Paxton wasn't. He'd gotten tired of her and left her a drunk. Somehow she heard I was in town... couldn't bring herself to face me, so she... killed herself. I buried her and kept looking for Paxton. I've cornered every man I've tracked since, but I never found Paxton. Are you still lookin'? When I find him, I'll kill him. What about your son? He's with friends. Last ones I remember makin'. [mellow western music] Untie me. [suspenseful music] Get up! Come on! Get on! [horse neighing] Mae? Yeah? You were with him last night? He trusts you. You can get that gun easy or that rifle of his-- No, Billy. What are you sayin'? I am not gonna get you a gun, Billy. Mae, you're killin' me! You are killing me! - [gunshot echoing] - [horse neighing] [Keough] Kinkaid! Kinkaid! I'd like to talk! Come on out! I'll meet you halfway. You come up here! [panting] So, you're Riddle. All this fuzz over you, huh? You don't look like that much to me. Well... I got an offer. We got enough food and water for a week. Now, you'll be lucky to last two days, that is... [chuckles] That is if you don't eat or drink nuthin'! - [laughing] - [spits] [laughing] You know, the sun... will be heatin' this rise hard all day. Times moves on, it'll be all dried up. Like dyin' leaves. - [gargling] - [spits] [laughing] Make your point. [Keough] Give us Riddle. You and the woman can ride out carrying a canteen of water. It's that or you're all dyin'. Thirst or a bullet. [contented sigh] You got an hour to sort it out. Are you gonna do like he says? I gotta admit I'm tempted, but no. The money? That and I don't trust Keough. I know him. Then what happens? As long as you're with me, Riddle, you stand to live just a little bit longer. He's right about that sun. Without water, it'll burn us right in the ground. I gotta make a move, but I need another horse. I'm going down there. I get into trouble, you cover me. What if you don't make it? Anything happens to me, you cut him loose. At least you stand a chance that way. You trust me? I guess I do. [suspenseful music] Mae! We're not gonna have a chance like this again. Cut me loose. I can't, Billy. Oh, come on, Mae! Mm-mm. I know it's not like it was, but... If you let him catch me, then you'll be sharin' in the kill. Well, I'm tellin' you! He ain't gonna risk that woman's life. He'll give us Riddle 'fore the day is out. I wouldn't count on it. If there was a $50 reward on his mother, he'd collect it. [suspenseful music continues] Mae... Mae, let me go! Mm-mm. Even if he does make a deal, you gonna let him ride out of here? None of us would get a night's sleep 'til he's dead. Amen! Mae, you owe me! Billy, if I did... what about Kinkaid? All I wanna do is get on a horse and ride for it! - [smack] - [upbeat western music] [Tully] Hey! The horses! We'll blast. Keep his head down! Get the horses! [gunshot] - [gunshot] - [outlaws yelling] [outlaws yelling] [gunshots] [gunshots echoing] Kinkaid! [gunshots] [gunshot] [gunshots] [sobbing] Mae, please. Please. Please. [sobbing] He's too good a man to be... spending his life huntin' the likes of you. [gun cocking] - [Mae] Kinkaid! - [gunshot] [gunshot] No! He's still worth $5,000. - But I thought that you-- - You thought what? You told me that Billy was never gonna be anything but an outlaw. It's just the same for you, you're gonna... spend your whole life hunting and killing! How many times do you think that you can kill Paxton? Lookit! It's Riddle. [all cheering] There goes Riddle. Let's go! Come on, we got him! We won! [horse neighing] I got a boy I haven't seen in a long time. You comin'? Let's get out of here. [upbeat western music]
