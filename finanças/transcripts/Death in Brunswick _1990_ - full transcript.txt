Oh my God. Mother? Is that you, are you all right? Oh hello, Dear. You up already? What are you doing in there? I'm doing what you should be doing. Really, I wish you wouldn't live like this. It so disappoints me. I know you think it's bohemian, all this filth, never washing the dishes and so on. But really it's just unhygienic. Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it, Dear? Yes, Mum. Don't call me Mum. It's common. Your landlord seems to be a very rude man. I opened it by mistake. You'll have to learn to pay your rent on time, Dear. I can't be expected to help you forever, now can I? Yes, Mum. I'm going for a job. Really? Oh, that's wonderful news. It's only a short stay this time, Dear. No more than a week. - A week? - You won't even notice I'm here. - Aris, this is the new cookie. - Yanni, this fridge is stuff again. I thought you was gonna fix it. - Yeah, yeah, later, later. - Later, later. - Well, this is it. It's got everything you need, no probs. Tony upstairs does the ordering and the buying. You do the cooking. - All right. - This is the cool room. Keep your veggies, chips in there. You feed the kids' faces, keep them happy. We make the money. Okay, Cookie? - Carl. Carl's my name. - Yeah, right. Okay, Cookie, go for it. - What? - Start cooking. - You want me to start cooking now? - Yeah. Don't tell me you can't cook that. - Well, yeah, of course I can, but-- - Yeah, but what? You want the job or don't you? - Well, yes I do, but, who helps me? I mean, do I have a kitchen hand or what? - Yeah, but what do you think this is? There's a welcome staffer comes in. Bastard, he should be here by now. But you know what a bloody helpless mob those Turks are. - Look, Yanni, I-- - I can't stay and chat all day. I've got a club to run, see. Any probs, take them to Laurie. He'll sort them out. Here's your keys. Back door, cool room, up the side. See ya, Cookie. Oh, and no drinking, okay? - Well when does, what? Phew. - You're the new cook? - Yeah. - Mustafa. Go on, say it. - Moose, Mustafa. - Oh. Mustafa. - Mustafa. - Okay, go ahead. - Carl. - Carl. - Yeah. Well, Mustafa, how about cleaning down the benches please? - Pigs, let them eat like pigs. - Yeah I know, but, it's my kitchen. - It's your kitchen, you clean it. - This bloody rotten beef they're giving me. What am I expected to do with these? Hey, Mustafa, feel like a drink? - Shouldn't drink in the kitchen. Maybe you cut your hand off. - Well I can see we're gonna get on well. Uh, who's on the bar? - Sophie and Carmel. - What are they like? - Don't. - I'm just gonna get a drink, that's all. Do you want one? - Don't. Don't go up there. - Keep an eye on the onions, will you? - Hello. - Hi, Cookie. I'm Sophie. - Carl. - Are you all right? - Oh, yeah, I was wondering if I could have a drink. - Staff aren't allowed to drink. - Yeah, I know. - So what do you want? - Tequila. And a dash of ginger. What are you doing going around dressed like that, especially in a joint like this? - Yeah, well. Yanni turns around the other night, and he goes, all your barmaids are gonna wear school uniforms tomorrow night, see? Bring the customers in. - Do you like working here? - It's all right. - Hey, Sophie, I'm never gonna get through the night on just this. Do you think you could bring us down another one? If you get a break. You've got lovely hazel eyes. Did you know that? - Yeah, okay, Cookie, why not? - You know the rules. No drinking. - Ugh, don't. - What are you looking at? Want some of this, eh? Do you, uh? Well piss off, Cookie. This belongs to management, got it? - I figure, mate, that's sexual harassment. - Sexual harassment, my ass. Downstairs, because we're gonna get a frigging pie machine. - Hey, Mustafa, what do you think of her? - Who? - Sophie. - Greek girls no good. Everybody give it to her. - Yeah? You haven't, have you? - I'm married. - Oh yeah, right. Laurie's a heavy bastard, though, isn't he? - Doesn't scare me. - Yeah well, couldn't scare me either. How long have you worked here? - Cooks come, cooks go. - Yeah, right. Hello, Mother. Yeah, yeah. I got the job. Yeah. Hey look, I can't talk right now, Mother. You're gonna have to make your own dinner tonight. I'm gonna be late home, all right? Yeah, I'm down here now. Yeah. - I love you. - I love you too, Mother. Yeah, right. All right, bye. - Thank you. - Great. - Thanks for sticking up for me. But you wanna watch out for Laurie. He's a real bastard. - You and him, you're not uh? - That big suck, no way. And my girlfriend, Carmel, she goes, she goes, that new guy in the kitchen, that Carl? He looks a bit like Sting. - Yeah? Sting, eh? - Yeah. - How long have you worked here? - Nearly a year. I used to work at the Safeways, but I got sick of that. And I did a bit of waitressing, and then me dad got me this job here. What about you? What have you been doing? You always been a cook? -Um. Could I, um, could I ring you at home, maybe? We could go out or something? - No, shit no. My dad doesn't like guys ringing up. I'll ring you. What's your number? We all thought you were a poof. - Yeah? Well, I'm not. - You're better looking than him, you know. Better looking than Sting. - Hey, Sophie! - Gotta go, Cookie. See you tomorrow, eh? - Yeah, okay. - Wake up, Dear, wake up! Time to get up. It's a lovely morning. - Oh, Jesus Christ, Mum. - It's nine o'clock, Carl. Don't shout at your mother. Sleeping in your clothes, you really are ... No wonder poor Pru left you. - Don't start now, Mum, please. - I'm only trying to help, Dear. Lord knows you need it. Just look at you. You ought to eat more fruit. You look all blocked up. Right, now get a move on, Carl. I want my breakfast. Did you find your magazines? - I only read them for the interviews, Mother. You're supposed to be giving those up. - Ashtray, Dear. I have very few pleasures left. Cigarettes, and my wonderful Mr. Mahler. The least you can do is put up with them for a while. What are you going to do today, Dear? - Well, I have to go to work at six, so I thought I'd just-- - Look, Uncle John's calling round to discuss my will, and I want you out. It'll all be yours one day, all I have. The Lord truly works in mysterious ways, doesn't He? - Uncle John? Mother, I just wanted to-- - It's a lovely day. Go for a walk. Get some air into your lungs. Hello. Yes, yes, he lives here. This is Mrs. Fitzgerald, his mother, speaking. Just a minute. I'll see if he's in. She sounds foreign. - Sophie? - Hi, I rang you earlier this morning, but your mum answered and she said you were out. - Oh right, yeah. What are you doing? - I'm at my Auntie Martha's place, looking after my cousin Con. What are you doing? - Oh, nothing much, just, sitting around, thinking about you. - Oh yeah. Listen, I'm gonna take Con to the movies. - Oh, would you like some company? Great. Look, I'll meet you outside. - Okay, Cookie, see ya. - Oh, yeah, and Sophe? Please don't call me Cookie, okay? - Yeah, okay. See ya. Mm. - Cookie. Really, Carl, what do you see in them? You're a terrible disappointment to me, you know? She's exceedingly common, I can imagine. ♪ I don't know why sometimes I get frightened ♪ - Oh. ♪ I can see my eyes ♪ ♪ You can tell that I Mm-mm. - Sophe. - Hi, Carl. Got the tickets already. This is my cousin Con. - Hi, Con. - Hey, Sophe, what's he got on his face? - Shut up, you little suck. Don't be so nosy. Come on. - Careful, Beckmeyer. Stop, Beckmeyer. This has gone far enough! - Don't. Stop! Sorry. - It's all right. Hi. - Hello. You're really good looking, you know that? - So are you. - Keep the energy in! - Ew, yuck, I knew this was gonna happen. - Shut up. - I'll tell Uncle George. - Better not. - I will. I'll tell him. - Shut up! - Hey, Mister, want some salt and pepper? - Yeah, go for it. - Give her the five fingers of death. - Sophie, do we have to stay here? - No, I've seen it three times already. Look, I'm going. Here's five bucks, catch a train home. Don't say anything. - How old are you? - 19. How old are you? - 30. Four. - It's not that old. My girlfriend, Helen, she's 16. She's married to this guy who's 40. - Yeah? - Yeah. - 40, eh? It's hot in here, isn't it? - That's Yanni's father and my dad. - Which one's your dad? - He's the biggest. - Looks a bit grim. Does he give you a hard time? - Yeah, sometimes. I got into a bit of trouble while I got school, you know. And he thinks no one's gonna marry me. Ma's all right. She sticks up for me. Except she doesn't speak English too good, you know. - What does your dad think of you working at the club? - He thinks Yanni's a nice boy, the fat suck. If Dad just knew. - What do you mean? - Oh, don't worry about it. It's got nothing to do with you. - Yeah, well, it's a rotten place. It's like a pit. I'll give it a couple more weeks, then I'll quit. - Yeah? Yeah, we didn't think you'd last long. - I'll miss you, though, Sophe. - Oh yeah. - No, it's true. I will. Do you really like me? - What do you think? - I think you're beautiful. - Am I? - Yes you are. - Get up a sec. Come on, get up. Okay. It's all right. I told you before, me mother won't be home for ages. Don't worry. - I'm not worried. - Oh, yes you are. Geez, you're thin. I'm gonna have to start going to the gym. - Sophe. You don't need to go anywhere. How come I didn't meet you years ago? - I don't know. Maybe because I was still in school. But you've met me now, haven't you? - Yeah, I have. Do you want a hand? - Yeah. No, don't. Carl, don't, I hate it. - What, what's the matter? - I can't wear a bikini. Don't look, okay? Please. Okay, now you can take them off. - Oh, Sophe. Oh, Sophie, it's beautiful. I love it. - What are you doing? - I'm a little shy too. - Geez, I really like you, Carl. I'll do it. Hi, Cookie. - Hi, Sophe. Sophe, I still got my shirt on. - Forget your shirt. - Sophe. - Oh, Cookie. - Oh, Sophe. - Oh, Cookie. - You did, didn't you? - Yeah, I sure did. It was really nice. - Oh, Sophe, it was great. It was really great, I loved it. - I've gotta go to the toilet. Can't go on the toilet, makes my boobs ache. - Just wait a second. - No no, Carl, I've gotta go. I told you before I got into trouble at school. - Oh, right, yeah. Oh. - Dad thinks I'm a slut. - Christ, Sophe. This is Australia. - Yeah, I know. Dad don't know that. He thinks it's Cyprus and that. The other day, he goes, he turns around and goes, Sophie, you get into trouble again and make your mother ashamed, I'll kill you. - Oh God. We didn't use anything. - Yeah, I know. That's why I've gotta go. - Hey. Never mind, Sophe. I'll look after you. - Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm. - What kinda name's Carl? You're not Australian, are you? - Of course I am. - You don't talk like a skippy butt. - Well I am. - You're different than guys around here. - How do you mean? - Just different. - Yeah? - Yeah. You're not like them. Like that Laurie always chasing me around with his thing hanging out, what there is of it. - Hey, Sophe, I hope you don't think that, that I-- - What? - Well, that, that I took you back to your Auntie Martha's just to, you know, because, because I really like you. - Well didn't you? Anyway, I took you there, remember? - Oh yeah. Hey, you wanna go and get some coffee or something? - I can't. I gotta see me mum and dad. We're going over to Yanni's parents' place for a visit. - Oh right, yeah. I'll see you tonight at work, eh? - Yeah. See ya. - Yeah, see ya. - Come on, you kids. You should be in school. - Piss off. It's school holiday. - Oh, right. - Dave! Dave? - Carl, my boy. How are you? - Hey, Dave. - Let's have a beer. Have a baby. -Um, okay. Oh. Thanks, Dave. Uh, where's June? - Oh, don't worry. She'll be a while yet. Sit down, relax. - Yeah. Um. I spent the morning having breakfast with Mother. - You poor bastard. How long's she staying? - A week. - A week? You'll never make it. I thought she had a crook ticker. - Yeah, well you shoulda seen the breakfast she put away this morning. - Now then. Where are we here? You owe me 1,585 dollars and 32 cents. - Dave? I've met this girl, this gorgeous Greek girl. Sophie. And, uh, she looks one of the '60s film stars, you know? - Gina Lollobrigida? - That's right, Gina Lollobrigida. - Hey. How old is she? - She's beautiful, really beautiful. - How old is she? - And she likes me. - How old is she, Carl? - She's 19, Dave. And, uh, I think I'm in love. - Take it easy, Mate. Last time you were in love, you got married. 1,600 dollars. So when did you meet her? - Oh, yesterday. - Oh, it's fairly serious then. - Cut it out, Dave. - You really are like a chook in a thunderstorm sometimes. I don't know. - Anyway, how's the boneyard, Dave? Dug up any good stiffs lately? - You know people used to go for picnics up there? You oughta come up there sometime. You'd probably like it. Oh shit, that's June. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Dad. - Not a word, you boys, okay? - Hello, Carl. - Hi, June. - What's wrong? - June. - We only see him when there's trouble. You said so yourself. How much do you need? - Take it easy, Babe. Man's in love. - Poor girl. Does his mother know? She still doing your washing for you? - I can't stop her. She likes doing it. - You're hopeless, Carl. Hopeless. When are you gonna grow up? And you're just as bad. Don't think I don't know. You encourage him. And, Dave, you could at least use a proper ashtray. Put the negative ioniser on. The house smells bad enough as it is without you adding to it. - It's rising damp. Bit of a feature of these old places. We oughta rent your mother out to the fire brigade. She can smell smoke at 40 places. Better be a bit careful of this Gina Lollobrigida of yours. Look at the trouble I'm in. - I warned you about that, you little rat! Here you go! Yankee bastard! - You all right? God, you don't waste time, do you? - Mind your own business, Carmel. - How about a drink? - Okay. - Give him an orgasm. - I enjoyed today. - So did. - It was fantastic. - Yeah, it was. - God, talk about a teenage romance. What's with you two? - I'll try and come down and see you later, eh? - That'd be great. - You're asking for it, Cookie. I catch you up here one more time, and I'm gonna fucking give it to you. Now get! - Lay off, will ya? - Yeah? Come on! Eh? You're piss weak. You're full of shit, Mate. - Laurie'll keep. He'll get his. Kuzhal's. Now that's a knife, Mustafa. Hey, Mustafa, you wouldn't have anything, would you? Just a little something, come on. - Maybe later. - Here you are, Cookie. - I take my break now. - Okay, Mustafa, good. - You look for trouble. - How's it going? - Good. You busy upstairs? - Yeah. - Got a sec? - Not really, but yeah, okay. - Come on. - Hello. - Hello. - Oh. I never really thought you were a poof. Just you talk a bit funny, you know. - Sophe, what are you doing? - Can we go back to your place after work? - Yeah. No, I mean no. My mother's there. Oh God. - You live with your mother still? - No, she's living with me. I mean she's staying. She's staying with me for a few days. She gets, she gets horny. Lonely, she gets lonely. - You sure now? - Yeah. - Geez you're nice, looking after your poor old mum. - Sophie, do we have to talk about it just now? - No. I'm still living with my parents. See I'm a good Greek girl, you know? - Yeah, yeah. I believe you. Yeah. - You sure? I am, you know. We better stop now. - No, don't stop now, Sophe. Oh shit! Oh. - Some woman's on the phone. She says she's your mother. - What's she want? - Come on. Come on. Your mum wants you. - You make trouble for all of us. - Yes, Mother, what is it? I am busy, you know. - Here. How much do you think? - Hey, how are my two favourite spunksters? - Great, till you turned up. - Yeah, I love you too, Carmel. Hey. Your dad and me had a real good talk.

Come on outside. - No I do. I do appreciate what you've done for me. I do. Do we have to bring Dad into this? I know what-- Look, Mother, please. I do realise that. I do. - I've got him! - You come back here again, you know what's gonna happen! - Mother. Look, Mother, just take a couple of Bex and lie down, will you? Good, okay, bye. Jesus, what's going on? - Piss off. - Shit. - Piss off, I said! - Hold him. - That's enough, Laurie, don't! - Get him outta here! - Come on, Cookie, get out! Come on. Get in there! It aint none of your business, got it? - Oh shit. - You got a bloody cheek, Mate. You bastard. - No no no! - You wanna know who told you? You wanna know, huh? Do you? It's your old mate, Cookie, that's who, huh? - Drink, I need a drink quick. Sophe, those bastards just did over Mustafa. They beat the shit out of him. But I'll fix him. I'll get that Laurie. - Carl, what are you talking about? Now don't. Laurie's a real nutter. He'll do you. He's been going around telling everyone you got AIDS. - Sophe, you gotta leave this joint. - I can't. I want to, but I can't. - Well you've got to. Look, they're all crazy around here. They're all coked outta their heads probably. Believe me. - You don't understand. I've gotta get back to work, Carl. - Sophe. I really like you. You do like me, don't you? - Yeah. I don't really know you, but ... - Can I see you later? - No, you better not. You better go. - Are you okay? - Listen, Sport, now you keep your mouth shut and you do the right thing down here, or else I'm gonna fucking give it to you. I don't like give-ups. You got me? - I got you. - You piss off on me, and you're gonna get what he got. Now I want pizza for me and the boys at 12:30. Let's have already. - Pizza, I'll give him fucking pizza. One. Two. Three. Four. Two tablespoons of mouse shit. And they're laughing. - Where's that fucking feed, Cookie? - You know something, this kitchen's a fucking disgrace. It looks all right. Not bad. Real spicy, good one, Cookie. - About time he cooked something decent. Hey, no olives. There's no olives, Cookie. - Yanni, who's gonna clean up tonight? I'm gonna be flat out. And when do I get paid? - Don't worry. You clean up, tomorrow I'll give you some dough. And a bit extra, huh? - I'll be here till five in the morning. - Now you've been fucking told, Cookie. Stop your wingeing. Yanni said he's gonna fix you up tomorrow, so you keep them pizzas coming and make some bloody chips. - I just hope I'm not gonna be too busy, that's all. - Excuse me. And, uh, watch your hands, Cookie. Keep them to yourself. You know what I mean? All right, guys, let's go. - Good one, Cookie. Special one. - Mustafa, what are you doing here? Are you all right? - They'll get you too. Pick up the glass! Where's my money? Where's my money! Geez. You told Laurie. - No, no, I didn't tell anything. Look, Mustafa, you've got it all wrong. - You tell Laurie! - No, I didn't do anything! They're bullshitting you! - You fucking pig! You tell Laurie! - Mustafa? Mustafa? - Yeah, all right. Stay there. Yeah, okay. - Look at the time. Who was that? - That was Carl. - What? What's he want? - I don't know. Couldn't get much sense out of him. He seemed really freaked out. I'll have to go down and see him. - What? Dave. You just did. - I'll have to go. He could be in strife. - Go then. - Oh, Babe, come on. - No, go on. Piss off. And you could sleep in the boys" room when you get back. - Carl? Carl, where are you? - Dave, Dave, I knew you'd come. I knew you would. - Jesus Christ almighty, you all right? Could we have some light in here? - No no. - What's going on? - Dave, look in the cold room. Under the potatoes. - Shit, who's this? Jesus Christ, Carl, this guy's dead. - Yeah, I know, I know. - Yeah, well, who did it? He's been stabbed. - Dave. I didn't mean to. I swear to God. He had a go at me. I must have had the fork and knife in my hand at the time. Jesus, what are we gonna do, Dave? - We? - Mm-hm. - Oh Christ, I don't know. Guess we should call the cops. It was an accident. It was self-defense. You did put him in there, didn't you? - Dave, I couldn't go to jail. I couldn't go through a trial and everything. I'd kill myself. Shit it was a really good day. Oh please, Dave, please, what are we gonna do? - Jesus Christ, Mate, I've got a wife and kids. You'll be right. And the cops'll understand that. - I can't tell the cops. Dave, Dave, you're my friend. - Yeah, all right. Yeah, all right, all right. Take it easy. Carl, do you swear? - Oh God, Dave. - Here. You're in a really bad way. Sit down. Sit down and calm down. Let me think. - Yeah, think. I knew you'd help me, Dave. I knew you would. - You got him right between the sixth and seventh ribs. Ah. If you're gonna chuck, do it now, and not in the car. Right, we'll take him down to my office then. - Okay, come on. - Go and open the car. The boot, open the boot, quick. He's heavy. - Christ, Dave, he's still alive. - No, it's just the fluids moving around inside him. - God. - Listen, we're not even halfway through getting this thing done, take it easy. Just do exactly as I say and we'll be all right. - Yeah, I will, Dave. I will, I promise. I feel okay now. - Good. Good. Jesus Christ. And do your seat belt up, for Christ sake. We don't want the cops stopping us now. - Was that you? - No. - Musta been me. Sorry. - Why is he so limp? I thought they went stiff. - No, they don't go like that yet for hours, thank Christ. Jesus Christ, Carl! - Sorry. - Hang on. DiForenza. This'll do. Put her down. I'm just gonna go and get a shovel and a crowbar. You stay here. Don't move. - Dave, can I come with you? I don't wanna stay here with ... - Don't worry. He can't hurt you now. - Dave? Dave? - Carl. - Dave? - Carl. - Whoa! - Carl? - Dave? - Carl, where the hell are you? - Dave! - Oh good. You found her. - Found who? - Mrs. DiMarco. - Who's Mrs. DiMarco? - I don't know, but you're standing on her. - What do you mean standing on her? Where is she? - Right below you. - Oh God, get me out, get me out. Whoa! Let's go home. Let's just leave him here. - That's exactly what we're gonna do, Mate. Here she is. Give us the crowbar, will you? - What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna give Mrs. DiMarco some company before her husband drops in in the morning. - Don't, Dave. Don't. - Well I don't hear anyone complaining, do you? - Aw, Jesus. - Oh my God. I didn't think of it. Are you all right, Carl? - Yeah, I think so. Yeah. - I'm gonna have to make room for the other. You wanna go for a walk for a minute? - No, I'm all right. - All right. - Oh, no. What's that smell, Dave? - Shut up and go and get him. - Mm. - Well I can't get him. I'm stuck in the bloody hole! - Oh yeah, right. Sorry, Mustafa. Can't lift him. - Well fucking roll him! - Yeah. - Hurry up. - Yeah. - Drag him. Got it? - Yep. - Okay, let him go. I've got him. - Yeah. - Put that across the grave, will you? - Eh? - Put it across the grave. How do you think I'm gonna bloody get out? No, across the bloody grave, Carl, for Christ sake. Jesus Christ, my flaming leg! - You all right? - No, I'm not. You'll have to get down and give us a bung up. - Oh, no. No, I can't, Dave, I can't, Dave. I can't go down there again. - You get down here, or you're walking home alone. - Oh shit. - Come on, Carl. Come on. - Here. - Jesus. Hey, give us your leg. - Oh, my head. - My leg. - Dave? What was that that green stuff in the coffin? - Fuck, I don't know. Mould, I guess. Jesus, they ought to burn them all. I thought it'd just be bones. Don't worry. 11 tomorrow, they'll put Mr. DiMarco on the top. I'll fill it in, and that's it. - Will you be okay? I know you don't sleep too well. - I don't wanna live like this anymore. Look at me. You won't tell Junie, will you, Dave? - What do you reckon? Anyway, I'm an accessory now. Are you supposed to go to work today? - Oh, I couldn't, Dave. - Well you've got to. I'll come in with you. You'll be all right. I'll pick you up after the funeral. - I'll never forget you for this, Dave. - Is that you, Dear? What's happened to you? - I fell over. - You should be more careful, Dear. - Morning, Chaps. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Dad. - How come you slept in our room? - You're not fighting, are you? - I don't know, are we? - Yes, we bloody well are. - Yeah, we are apparently. - You're covered in, what is it? Mud? It's even in your hair. And you stink. I can smell you from here. What were you doing, playing in a sewer with him? Keep away. - Oh, yeah, Daddy smells. - Oh. - Buggered your leg, I see. Well, don't expect any sympathy from me. You been out boozing with him again, haven't you? - Babe, I swear, we didn't have a single drink. Carl just got in a little bit of trouble, and I ... - Oh yeah? What kinda trouble? Come on. What kind of trouble? - I better go to work now. - Dave, you come right back here. Dave! - Dave? Dave, where's my fork? - Don't worry about that. I got rid of it. Now, you sure you'll be all right if I go now? - Yeah, I think so. Geez, it's like nothing ever happened here. - That's the way it should look, Mate. - Oh, Cookie, who's your mate? He want a job? - This is Dave. - Huh. Come on, bring him them in, Laurie. Listen, Cookie, this is Mustafa's missus and his kid. You know Mustafa. Anyway, he hasn't been home and that, and I was telling them we haven't seen him. Isn't that right, Cookie? Isn't that right? -Yeah, I ... - My mom says, have you seen my dad, Mustafa Kaya? - Look, I-- - Cookie don't know nothing. Do you? Do you? Listen, Kid, tell your mum, he's probably out somewhere, he's getting whacked or something. - My dad doesn't drink. Do you know where my dad is? Do you know where he is? - No, I don't. - Cookie's real busy now. Come on, let's go. Let's go, come on. Let's go. - Leave her alone! - What? What'd you say? - He said leave her alone. - Yeah? And who are you, asshole? - I'm his mate. - You tell your mate to keep his mouth shut. Or else. - Let her go! - Hey, take it easy, Laurie! We don't want there to be trouble here! Take it easy! Let the lady's arm go. Laurie! Let it go. - Piss off! You'll keep, Turkey. Don't think you won't. - Excuse me. Listen, Cookie, I've got some bad news for you. We're a bit short on sale, it's a liquidity problem, so we gotta cut down a bit on staff. You better finish up now, eh? Here you go. - Fuck him, Yanni! - Hey. - Don't pay him. Little poof. - Come on, Carl, let's go. - My jacket. - Now, come on, let's go. Let's go. Haven't you learnt? Don't touch things that don't belong to you. You oughta get yourself a new heavy. This one's full of wind. - Piss off, Cookie, you're a wretch around here! Get up! - Mrs. Kaya? Take it please. It belongs to your husband. Please. Please. - You shouldn't have done that, you know? Why didn't you just tell her you did it? You want a lift home? - No, I'll walk. - Well take it easy. Look after yourself. - You too. - What are friends for? - Sophie. - Carl, what are you doing here? - Waiting for you. - Well you better not let Laurie see you. - Sophie, how about-- - Don't, Carl, don't touch me. - What's wrong? Sophe, I really need to see you. - I can't talk now. Me dad's picking me up. - What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. - Sophe, I've got to see you. We need to talk. - No, there's nothing to talk about. I don't wanna see you anymore. - What? Look, Sophe. - There's me dad now. No, I gotta go. - Oh no. - You bastard! You fucking bastard! - Shit. - You're dead, Cookie! You hear me? You're dead! I'll find you! Go away, you bastard! You better run! - Wake up, Mother, wake up. Come on, Mother, wake up! - Carl, now what are you doing? Where am I? - Come on, Mother, we have to leave. - Is the house on fire? Carl, what's going on? - They think it's me, Mother. I know they do. They're gonna kill me. - Who is, Dear? - You take this, Mum. Here's your bag. Your place, Mum. - Yes, I'll tell him. Thank you, John. Bye-bye. Carl, your Uncle John said you should go down to the nearest police station and tell them exactly what happened. I know you're listening, Dear. - Mother, I overreacted last night. I'd been drinking. It was just a little flareup in the kitchen, that's all. A slight altercation between management and staff, nothing at all, it happens all the time. - We'll have no lockboxes here, Dear, as the dear nuns used to say. Carl. - All right. - Psst. Psst. Psst. Carmel? - Oh shit, Carl? What the hell are you doing up there? Perving? - No. No, I wanna see Sophie. Can you go and get her please? - I don't know if I should. - Please, Carmel, it's really important. It's a matter of life and death. Can you tell her that please? - Okay. - Thanks. - You wait there. - What's this? - It's a wedding invitation. They've already gone out. Sophie said to say that's it. It's final. She doesn't wanna see you again. - Aw, no. No, she can't marry Yanni, not that fat slug. Carmel, you're her friend. We've got to stop her. We can't let her ruin her life. - Oh, you'd rather ruin it for her instead, huh? - Look, I love her. - You're weird, Carl. Weird. - Please, Carmel. Please. - Okay, the Brunny Baths, five o'clock tomorrow, I'll have her there. The rest is up to you. - Thanks a lot. - Is that you, Dear? - Yes, Mother. - In here, Dear. I found just the thing for you. Cook wanted for nursing home. Must be prepared to wash dishes. Experience with geriatric diets preferred. Award rates. - I've worked in those places, Mother. Those old ladies, they smell. - Don't be so cruel, Dear. I'll be like that one day. I hope you'll be more considerate when you have to look after me. This nonsense has gone on for far too long. I want to be a grandmother, Carl. Did you have a nice day, Dear? - Um, yeah, it's all sorted out. I didn't need Uncle John. - Oh, that's good, Dear. - He's here. - It's the first time I've ever been here. Everyone's so, brown. - You really done it now, haven't you? What are you doing here? They're all out looking for you, you know. You could have killed someone. - Sophe, I didn't do anything. It's all a mistake. - I'm in big trouble because of you. Yanni and Laurie came into my parents' place at three o'clock in the morning wanting to know if I knew where you lived. - Shit, I'm sorry, Sophe. - And they're gonna put the cops onto you as well. - Shit. - What's gotten into you anyway? - Look, Sophie. It wasn't me, it was ... It was some guys in the car. I don't even know who they were. - What are you gonna do then? - I don't know. - I'm gonna go, Carl. - Sophe, please. - Look, I'll get Yanni and Laurie off your back, but you gotta stay away from me, okay? - No, Sophe. - It's all arranged, understand? It's over between you and me. Bye, Love. - She's crying, Carl. Happy? - I didn't mean to. I'll wait outside. - Don't. Go home. Leave her alone. - I haven't done anything. You've got the wrong man. - Shut up! We got the right man. - Careful with those. Those are Ray-Bans. - Why you get mad at his missus, eh? - I didn't. - Don't shit me, Mate! Maybe they cut your nose off. Maybe your balls. What do you think, huh? - It was ... It was Laurie. - Who? - Who? - You know Laurie, big bloke who works at the club. - Laurie. I saw him beating up my staffer, and I tried to stop him. Honest I did, I tried to stop him. - You got 10 minutes. If you don't come out within 10 minutes, we'll come and get your balls, all right? - Yeah, all right, all right. - Carl, what's happened to you? - Mustafa's mates picked me up. They reckon I know where he is, and they're outside waiting for me. - Well you better get outta here quick. Laurie's, shit. - Give me the drink, Sophe. Shit house! This band's shit house. I told Laurie to book somebody decent for a bloody change. What do you think, Mate? Laurie! I'll see you later, Mrs. Voulgaris, mwa. Hey, Laurie. Hey, Laurie! - Don't, Sophe. Don't marry him. - He'll have to go out the back way, through the fire escape, Tony's in the kitchen. I'll cover for you. Quick, get him out. Piss off. - Fuck you, Carl, you got no right coming down here. - I didn't have much choice, believe me. - You're determined to stuff things up for me, aren't you? It's locked, shit! I'm gonna have to go up to Yanni's office and get the key. You stay here, all right. I'll be back in a minute. - I'm not going anywhere. Come with me, Sophe. - Hello, Cookie. - Hi, Laurie. - Long time no see. - I left some of my stuff here. I thought I'd, come back and collect it. - Yeah? Bad news, Cookie. You know that? You're real bad news. - Get back, Laurie. - Oh, a real tough guy, eh? Huh? - Stay back, Laurie! - I'm scared. I'm real scared. You're piss weak, Mate. You're really piss weak. This is how you do it. Ah, shit! Oh you. - Get back, Laurie. Get back! - Come on, Mate. You're afraid, aren't you? Come on. Come on, you tough guy. You fucking bastard, Cookie. You bastard! Come here! Get out here now! Say your prayers, Cookie, because I'm gonna fucking kill you! - Get off him, Laurie! Get off! - What's going on here? - He tried to burn the joint down, Yanni! - I tell you, I wasn't. - Oh shut your face. What do you think you're doing, huh? What do you think I am? You must think I'm stupid or something! Sniff around behind my back all the time. You ... - You what? - You've always been a slut. I told my dad that before! You marry her, she's yours. - Come on, Carl, let's go. - Just a minute. Don't think-- - What? Don't think of what, eh? You piss off, Cookie, before I change my mind! - Come on, Carl. - Better go, Cookie. - Fuck, Yanni, you're a weak prick. - Leave them, Laurie. They're shit. - Come on, Carl. Come on! Come on. - I'm stuck. Oh no. - Oh, Cookie, you just can't learn how to run, can you? - Fuck you, Laurie! - Anytime, Sweetheart. Anytime! - Go on, Sophe, run away. Run! - Is that you, Mustafa? You back for some more then, are you? Yeah, you come and get it then, you bastards. Come on, you come and get it! - We'll cut your head off. Do you hear! We'll cut your head off. - Jesus Christ. - Sophe, Sophe, wait. Wait. I need a rest. - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for what you did for me back there. - I don't know why I didn't leave you there. Look at you. - Oh, Sophe. Sophe. - Hi. - Hi. - Dave, this is Sophie. Sophie, this is Dave. - Hi, Dave. - You mind if we come in? - No, of course not, Mate. - Hey, thanks a lot for putting me up. I won't be here that long, will I? - Oh no, just a couple of days at the most. Until things calm down a bit, you know. If that's okay. - Yeah, that's fine. Junie, isn't it? - You told your mother yet, Carl? - No, not yet. Just need a little time with her. She's, um, she's got funny ideas about migrants, you know. - That's okay. I was born here. - Why don't you tell her the truth, just for once? - I couldn't do that. She wouldn't like it. It's great spaghetti, Junie. - How old are you, Carl? - She's been sick. - You've got another problem as well, haven't you? Have you told Sophie you're still married? I think it's time you and I did the dishes, Dave. - Sophe. - I just did it to please my mother. I didn't even like her. - Carl. - She was horrible. We fought all the time. - Are you still seeing her? - Not really. - Poor Carl. - Poor Carl? If he runs out on her, I'll hold you personally responsible. - Look, I haven't seen her for ages. - Yeah, sure. - No, it's true. It's over, it's finished. I'm getting a divorce. What am I gonna do, Dave? What am I gonna do? I mean, I really like her, you know. I love her. All I need is, some money and a car, yeah, a car. - Go home, Carl. Sort it out in the morning, eh? - Dave, you've got a car. Maybe you could ... Actually, better still, maybe you could lend me-- - Just go home. - Dave, look, we wouldn't need very much. And, I could ask Mother for ... I could tell her ... That wouldn't work. Dave, look, if you could just see your way clear-- - Look, you stupid bastard. Make a decision. You're screwing Sophie's life up. You killed a guy, for Christ sake, and it's all been for what? I've had it with you, you and your mother. Reactionary bitch, why don't you bloody well nick her? And fucking do yourself at the same time! - Well, I guess I better go then. - Dear Mother of God, I know it's my fault the way he is. We spoilt him when he was a little boy, but I couldn't help it. He was so sweet. Such a dear. I know he would have been a better man if he'd finished university. Look at Dr. Lee and his beautiful suits. Now he's a chef. I know he hates it. He looks so tired, poor boy. He's rude to me, but he can't help it. I'm an old woman. I nag him. Maybe it will be better if it happens soon. - Amongst us today, we have people who have committed adultery, lied, stolen, had an abortion, perhaps even perpetrated an act of violence against a neighbour. Now as victims, we may find it difficult to forgive those who have stolen our video recorders, slept with our wives and husbands, or assaulted us. But we most. For today we are praying to the God who is all knowing, all forgiving. Hallelujah. - Hallelujah. His words give us mission. Hallelujah. - Today's reading comes from the Gospel according to Matthew. - Get up, Dear. It is the Gospel. - What's happened to the Mass, Mother? - Sh. This is how it is now. - Then Peter went up to Him and said, "Lord, how often must I forgive my brother if he wrongs me? "As often as seven times?" Jesus answered, "Not seven times, I tell you, "but 77 times." 77 times. This is the Word of the Lord. - Thanks be to God. - Sit down, Dear, sit down. - Now, my dear brothers and sisters, I'd like to say a few words to you about forgiveness. Yes, forgiveness. For Christ is the judge of judges. He's a heavenly, almost all-forgiving judge. Yes, all forgiving. Your Heavenly Father will forgive anything. The bigger the sin, the bigger the forgiveness. Even a heinous sin, like murder. The taking of a human life. Isn't that a wonderful thing? A sin like that, washed away in holy blood. We pray to God in the knowledge that we will all one day be reunited in His love on that great day of judgement, when once again we will meet the dead, in the flesh. Face to face. What a wonderful day that will be, friends. Let us now offer each other a sign of peace. - Peace be with you. - What are you doing, Dear? Are you all right? Let go of the man's hand, Dear. - What was that, Mother? - Let go of the man's hand. - God bless you. - Peace be with you. - What's this? Headless horror. What is the world coming to? Poor man. Probably just went for a stroll, doing nobody any harm. You never know when the Good Lord wants you, do you? - No, Mother. - I put on your favourite music, Mother. - Oh, thank you, Dear. - I'll just be a minute. - Thank you. - How much do you think you're worth, Mother? - Oh let's not talk about money on the Sabbath, Dear. - Just a guess. - Well, I don't know. - How many sugars, Mother? - Two, Dear. - Good. - I have thought about changing my will. - You haven't, have you? - No, of course not. Charity begins at home, they say, don't they? What's this? Carl, I thought you'd know better than that. Never in my life have I ever drunk tea out of a coffee mug. - Right. Make a guess, Mother. How much do you think I'll, I'd inherit? - Well, your grandfather's money alone is over 100,000 dollars. - What? What money? - He left it in trust for you. I haven't touched a penny of it. Well, not the principal anyway. - What are you talking about? This is the first I've heard of it. What money? When do I get it? Why haven't I got it? - My tea, Dear. - Why haven't I seen any of this? You've been holding out on me, haven't you? - Carl, my tea. - I should give you this tea, Mother. I should bloody well give you this tea. You deserve it. All this time I've had nothing from you, nothing but shortcomings! When do I get it? When do I get my money? I want my money! God, you've been living off the interest, haven't you? Jesus, off my money! - My tablets, Carl. The red and white ones. - Mother. Mother. - Oh, Carl. Carl. I can't breathe. - Mother, take this. I'll get an ambulance, Mother. - Get a taxi. It's cheaper. - All right. - Your mother doesn't look so good. - Yeah. Only one. You'll be all right, Mother, I promise. Oh! - I've got it, Mate. - Shit. Here you are, Mum. Now swallow. Oh for God sake. Swallow it, Mum. - Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I caused this. I know it. I wanted you dead. Your own son wanted you dead, God forgive me. I don't know what I was thinking of. I've killed before. I killed Mustafa. Then Dave and I smashed up an old dead woman so we could hide his body. And then his wife and kids came down to the club looking for him, and I lied to them, it was horrible. And then the club got firebombed. And, Laurie, Laurie got beheaded. Well, I hated him but I didn't want ... And now Sophie's parents have disowned her and you're ... You're a vegetable, and it's all my fault. I'll make it up to you, Mother. I promise. Sophie and I'll look after you. I'll get power of attorney and build you a lovely little granny flat out in the backyard. You'll like Greek food, Mother. I'm sure you will. - You sure this is a good idea? - Sophe, I've already told you everything's gonna be different now, we're making a new start all round. A clean slate, as Mother used to say. And I think it's time for the future in-laws to meet each other. - I don't know, Carl. My dad's still pretty mad. Yanni made him pay for the reception, the church, the priest, everything. It was all part of a customer packet. Here it is. Hi, Dad. - Hi, Mr. Papafogos. We haven't really met, but I'm Carl Fitzgerald. And this is my mother. Unfortunately, she's paralysed from the neck down. And Sophie, Sophie you already know. Now I know there's been a little ill feeling between us, a little misunderstanding, but I'm sure that, I'm sure that ... It'll be fine, I promise. Relax, Sophe, I know what I'm doing. Mr. Papafogos, I don't quite know how to put this, but well, try to think of it not so much as losing a daughter but more like gaining a son. Oh, Cookie. Cheese.
