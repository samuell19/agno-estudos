♪ Oh, oh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ Hey. Hey, where's your mask? Oh...um... I'm just shitting you, kid. Sit down. Okay. Actually, I'm surprised you're open with all this stuff going on. They didn't shut you down? No, I've been open for about a week. Okay. Slow, though. Ain't seen you in here before. Usually it's just the regulars come in this dump. Well, I'm back in town. Uh-huh. Business or pleasure? Pleasure, I guess, I'm hoping. I'm here to see an old friend. Or two. We'll see. Uh-huh. Okay. What can I get you, kid? Oh, shit. Dork. All right, Mom. Gonna sanitize real good. Get it, get it, get it, get it. Get underneath those nails. Hey, darling. Hi, hon. How are you doing? I'm okay. Aunt Carmen sends her love again. Yeah. Well, she sends her love all the time, so getting a little stocked up here. I know, but I told you how she is. I think she just really wanted to meet you before the wedding. Well, we did push it off another year and a half, so I'm sure we can make that happen at some point. Why don't you -- I don't know -- put in a good word for me? Yeah? I really think we should plan a time in the next few months when you're not working to come back here. I mean, don't get me wrong. Getting stuck here when quarantine broke for the last two months, it's not gonna make me want to come back any time soon, but we should plan something. Well, that was your choice, Carly, so... Better safe than sorry. Well... you could have -- could rented a car. I know. I just With Mom's health, it's -- it's been good that I'm here, but now I'm missing you. Right. Anyway, I'm just calling to remind you I'm gonna be in tomorrow morning at 11:05. Yeah, 11:05. I'll be there, bright and early. Can't wait 'cause, uh, we've got a lot to talk about. Babe, I really wish we didn't have to cancel the wedding. I was really looking forward to getting married next month. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you mean. It'll happen, though, and, you know, when it does, we'll just look back and kind of forget this whole thing stopped us. Okay? I know. I love you. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye. Bye. Great. Hey, I was going to call you. I thought we were gonna talk last night. I was waiting. Yeah. Um, sorry about that. I'm so sick of Bel-Air. Oh, I want to come over tonight, Reid. No, no, no. That -- That can't happen. Why? W-Well... Carly, my fiancée. Remember her? Well, she's coming back tomorrow. So I really know how this must sound, but... You know what? No, screw that. I don't know how it sounds, and I'm sorry. I just... I mean, we kind of knew what this was. We -- We -- We got to end it now. So...yeah. How long have you known this? Uh, I mean, I-I -- Known what? What are you talking about? That your fiancée was coming back. Oh, oh. I mean, I... I always knew she was coming back, so I'm not really sure... I meant how long have you known she was coming back tomorrow? Um...well, she bought a plane ticket, and -- and it was about, like, a week ago, a week and a half. So about a week and a half. I mean, you know, things are -- Things are opening back up here. We're in phase 5-7-Alpha-Q-Delta. I don't know. I don't what we're naming them anymore. Maybe it's phase fire tornado. I don't know, but we're opening back up, so, you know... So basically last week then. I've been over there twice since then. You could have told me. Yeah. I know. Okay. Look, I'm sorry. I-I should have told you, but I didn't. Now it's done. She's coming back, and... yeah, I mean, we knew what this was. We agreed to it, so... Did we? Yeah, we did. Sage? Sage, are you there? I want to see you tonight. That can't happen. "Can't" isn't the correct word. It most certainly can happen, although you may not want it to. Sage, what the -- What the hell? No, I'm so sorry, Reid. So sorry to be so direct and forthcoming, but I kind of have this plan. Plan? I'm afraid so. I really don't mean to get all "Fatal Attraction" on you here, but... Well, I guess it's kind of what this is. You know how strongly I feel about you. Furthermore, you know how I feel about my husband. He and I... are dead. Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned that, but you know what? It's weird. Maybe it's tone or the phone or I don't know, but it sounds like you're planning some kind of a crazy little getaway, us running away together. Well, that's the jackpot answer, honey. Okay. Um... we can't. Reid, I don't want to beat around the bush anymore. I've been doing that this whole time. The bush is trimmed. Look through it. I want this to be more than a quarantine love affair. Uhhhh...Sage. I'll see you later, honey. Uh, mm... Okay. She hung up. Okay. What serious fuck is wrong with you?! Mm. Yo, what up, Mr. Reid? Mr. Deed, Mr. Steed, Beed, Bee. Hey, Harriet! Oh, my God, I'm glad you picked up. Um, what's new? Well, you know, it's still quarantine, so as always, nothing. Any word on whether or not they're gonna let us back into the office any time soon or... You know, I just don't know. Was it phase 2 or 5 or 29? No, no, no, no. No news here. No, just -- just, you know, wheeling and dealing. Just having a good -- good old time. Oh, great. So what can I do for you, Mr. Deed, Mr. Steed, Mr. Bleedy-Bleed? Well, well, well. Harriet, Harriet, Harriet, Harriet, do you... Do remember that -- that client up in Sacramento? Um, yeah. Old Sacramento? What was his name? Mason something? Mason Delaware. Rich dude, right? Like, a billionaire? That's the one! Yes, you do remember. Good old Harriet. You remember these things. That's good. That's good. Yeah, what about him? Well, well, well, do you -- You don't remember we were dealing with those -- trying to sell off the profit shares, and -- and he had his wife who came to join us? Mm, I don't really remember 'cause I think that, like, was more your part of the deal, but... Yeah. Yeah. That was me handling that point. Thank you for remembering that so vividly. I mean, is there a problem? We sold them on the deal, yeah? Oh, I sealed the deal. Yeah, I definitely sealed it pretty tight. So no, nothing on that. No, nothing going on there. Well, you're just gonna have to give me a little bit more information or a clearer picture of what you're trying to say there, pal. 'Cause I'm a little lost. Reid? Hey, look, look, look. I-I know that, you know, lockdown's been tough and everything, but, hey, just remember -- Your beautiful, amazing fiancée's coming back tomorrow. So there's that. Yeah. I'm remembering that pretty clearly right now, that my beautiful fiancée's coming back. Thank you for that, Harriet. Appreciate that. Mm-hmm. Hang in there Mr. Reid. My bleedy-bleedy boo-bah. You're gonna make it, okay? Oh. Reid? Rude! Everybody's losing their mind. Mmm. Carly! Girl, what's up?! Hey. How are you? Oh, doing good, doing good, you know. Hey, speak of the devil... Mm, I'm not sure that's the right term, but I just spoke with your handsome, man-some little fiancé, and I'm pretty sure he's losing his mind. Really? I don't know. It was weird. It was like, he called to ask about a client, but then it seemed like he maybe forgot about it or something, but just a heads-up if you come home and he's gone mad, so... Okay. Thanks for the warning. So, what's up, my Carly-Barly-Schwarly-Farly? You're doing good out there? I miss you guys, and in all honesty, Reid really does miss you, too. So I'm glad you're coming home. I'm ready to come back. And I was thinking the three of us should get together, and -- I don't know -- we can sit 6 feet apart if it makes you feel better. Oh, yeah, girl. Totally. You know I'm all good about that stuff. It'd be great to see you. I-I've, like, not seen a real person. Well, I have, but not hung out. You know what I mean. With a real person in a couple months now, so it's getting bad. And feel free to bring Shane. Yeah... About that. Um... Shane and I kind of aren't Shane and I anymore. What? It's a short story that isn't very interesting. And you know what? I can waste five minutes of your life when I see you in person with it. So how about that? Sounds good. What? I don't know. It's... Ever since we've known you, you go through this same routine with every guy you date. Are we really getting into this right now? Where do you got to be? Fair enough. Listen, I don't know who this Mr. Right was, and since you refuse to talk about him, lower your expectations. Just... Wow. Thanks for that. You know what I mean. I get it, girl. You know what? I promise -- I will do my very best to lower all expectations. You are a terrible liar, girl. I love you. Love you, too, girl. And miss you guys. See you real soon, okay? My Carly-Schwarly. Schwarly-Barly, you stay safe out there. Bye. Oh, what's wrong with you, man?! What did you do? What did you do? Why? Why? Why would you do that? What was the point of that? I'd like to just... Oh, you know what? That wouldn't kill me. That would only hurt a lot, and I just don't have that kind of medical insurance going on right now, with everything in lockdown. So I could just... That's great. That's good. Yeah. Perfect. Why wouldn't it be perfect? That's exactly perfect. That's... She would send a perfect message because she cherry-picks her perfection. She takes it from words. She looks in a thesaurus. She double-checks everything, and she brings on the thunder. That's what she does. Great! So great. And who am I? I'm the schmuck that cheated on her, that stepped out on her. I'm that schmuck. I'm that guy. All her friends are gonna be talking about me. They're gonna be making up stories. They're gonna be saying, "Hey, remember that schmuck you were with for a while? He was a real schmuck." Mm! Mm! What is wrong with you?! What is wrong with you? Are you stupid?! Are you a fucking moron?! Of course you are 'cause you did all the moronic things that morons do. You fucking idiot. Sage, yeah, super-hot, crazy hot. There's hot bitches everywhere in the world. Why would you do it with her? Why would you pick her? Why would you go that route? The sex was good. The sex was good. I understand that. You need a little lovin'. You got to -- Alone. I get it, I get it, but Sage! Sage! And now Carly's coming back. Oh, that's fantastic. Gonna be great when she finds out about that. Look at you, you dumb fucking idiot. And you know what? You deserve this. This is all your fucking fault. You did this to yourself. You got no one to blame, Reid. Nobody at all! Nobody! Nothing! Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing! So you know what? Suck it up, son, 'cause this is the end for you, pal. It's the end of the road. It's the end of the long, stupid road, and you're not getting back the road. You're gonna be nothing! And you're gonna be Okay? Get it? Got it? Great. Good, good. I'm gonna be over there. Okay. Schmuck. Yes? Buddy, how's it going? Lincoln? That'd be me, old pal. Jesus, Lincoln. It's been, like, what, two years? Well, it's been three, actually. Thanks for counting. Sorry about that. Yeah. I know. I haven't been in town. I've been on the run. You know me, business as usual. Uh-huh. Yeah, I sincerely doubt that. Any jobs? Well, there was this gig up in Boise that kept me busy the better part of last year. All their infomercials went through me. Oh, all the infomercials. How many of the "all the infomercials" were there? Eight. Eight? Eight. That's good. Eight infomercials. Nice. All right. So things have been slow, okay? I'm not Fellini yet. I get it. You know what, buddy? I really hate to rush off here. I can't really chat. I'm kind of in the middle of something. Yeah, well, how long is that something gonna take to resolve? I don't know. The rest of my life. Something like that. Simple thing. Yeah, I-I hear that. Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Uh, where -- where are you anyway? At this place called Kelsey's Pub. it's a bar here in town. You know, Kelsey's Pub is closed 'cause of pandemic. Pandemic kind of closed everything down, kind of shut it all down. Pandemic? What are you talking about? Yeah, yeah, pandemic. Things -- Thing going on. I don't know if you know about it. It's a virus. Oh, the thing with the masks. Right, right, right. Well, I don't think they so much care about that here. I mean, I am the only one in here right now, but they are very much open. I think they're doing some sort of, like, Prohibition bootleg-style opening kind of thing. I'm here. I'm in town. I want to see you. I want to come over. Come on. Perfect! Hey, but you know what? Better idea -- Don't. Because I don't think that Carly's gonna like you coming over. I think that -- I don't know what she would think of it, you know. Well, according to Carly's last Facebook post, she's still quarantined in Dallas. So she won't be thinking anything, now, will she? Right, right. So let me come over. Come on. I forgot that you like to stalk people on Facebook. That's nice. That's good. That's good. Good to remember that. No, she's in Dallas with family. No, actually, the thing I'm in the middle of is something entirely different. So just not the best time to play catch-up with an old buddy. Okay, look, look, you're upset. I get it. It's my bad. I haven't been around. You're mad. I understand. I'll tell you what, man. Why don't I just call you back later? Okay? I assume that you're staying awhile, right? Mm, you're not gonna call me. We both know that. But yes, I'm in town. Okay. Well, why don't you just keep on hanging? And, you know, I'll just hit you back. I'll hit you up, okay? All right. All right. It's good chatting with you. I'll hang you. All right. See you in the three years. Okay, bye. Same? Please. You know, I don't mean to pry, but I couldn't help but overhear you're a director of sorts? A director of sorts. That's a great way to put it. You're talking to the world's okayest infomercial director. Mm. Basic public access stuff. Nothing you would have seen around these parts. Mm. Must've been a rough couple of months for you, huh? I mean, what with the lockdown and all. Rough couple months. Yeah. Right. Worse, huh? Well, I mean, if you want to get into it, you are a bartender, I am a patron. We could do the cliché... Lay it on me. It was a woman. Yeah, it usually is. Yeah. I had a woman once. We had a daughter together. Ain't seen her in a long time, though. Well... What happened? In my case, I guess you could say it was two women. Mm-hmm. This girl and I were together. We dated, never really got too serious, but we were a real good match, you know? I mean, it was nice, and then someone else came along. But, I mean, it wasn't an affair or anything like that. I mean, we were never serious, you know? Yeah. With the first girl? Right. First girl -- not serious. Girl number two comes along. Uh-huh. I go off with her. She ends up leaving me. Serves me right. So you chose door number two, but what you really wanted was behind door number one. Correct. Yeah. And now here I am, back where it all went down, attempting to salvage the one friendship I've somewhat maintained over the years, but that's gonna have to be put on hold because, well, he's busy with something. Mm. I hear you. Tell you what. Next one's on the house. Thanks. ♪ No, you haven't yet ♪ Who is it? Nope. False alarm. Ah! I see you've dolled yourself up for our evening together. Sage. How'd you get in? Through your back door, stupid. Ah, yeah. I've been knocking for 10 minutes. Oh, Called you. 10 minutes, that's -- That's terrible. Yeah. Pobrecito. I really am sorry about that. I, uh... I was -- I was -- I was... "I was -- I was -- I was..." Uh-huh. Yeah, thanks for the warm welcome. You know, it would have been warmer, but I didn't want you to come. So there's that, yes, yes. By the way that you look and smell, I don't think you're in any coherent state to decide on anything. Okay. Yes, I am drunk because I've been drinking, because of our little phone chat a little earlier today. That was a nice one, put me in a real, uh, pickle. Like a pickle. Like a Vlasic. Like, you know, the Vlasic guy. Uh-huh. -You know, like a stork. -Yeah, I got it. I think he's a stork. I don't know if he's a duck, a stork. -I think he delivers things. -I don't know. -Has a mailman's hat. -I don't really care. -I don't know either. -Moving on. It's kind of disturbing me that I can't remember exactly what type of animal he is. Point is, I can't understand exactly why it is you would want to have more than a fuck buddy, you know, situation with us? Because that was actually just fine, and, instead, you decided to go full-on, um... What was the term you used before? Oh, it's my favorite movie. -Oh, "Fatal Attraction." -Yeah. -That's right. -I love that movie. You had to go "Fatal Attraction" syndrome on me. And that was really delightful. Really cute and adorable and all those things. But um, you know, I mean, you took pictures of me while I was sleeping. -I did, I did. -Why? Oh, I don't know. Because you're beautiful, Reid. Oh, okay. Ah. Okay, well... that's nice. Oh, come on now, Reid. Stop. Stop drinking. Look, Sage, I get it. You don't love your husband anymore. Or maybe you never did. I don't know. Wow. Okay. Yeah. I'm really sorry about that, okay? But I actually still care for Carly. Mm-hmm. Still do. And she really doesn't deserve this at all. So I... Wow. I think that we should just go with what we originally planned, which was that when Carly was gonna come back, we would be done. Okay? So we're done. Ah. We're really not. Ha. What? Okay. Okay. Pictures all in the bag there? Is that what you're gonna do? You're gonna show them to Carly? Is that your plan? Well, I think it'd be better if you did. Oh, I'm not gonna do that. Oh, come on. Come on, Reid. Oh, we could be great together. We could. We could have one of those loves that they sing about in those love songs. I don't know any love songs that are... -Oh, yes, you do. -amidst a pandemic, and an affair and all that. I just don't think I know any of those songs. Well, you need to expand your musical library. Oh, my musical library is just fine. Thank you very much. It went to Harvard. Not when I last checked your iTunes. Oh, wow. You didn't check the hidden playlist that I've got. Did you just say "Harvard"? Well, the music went to Harvard. I didn't go to Harvard. What the hell are you talking about? My music went to Harvard. I don't know why -- how it's not clear for you. Mm-hmm. But, anyway, it doesn't matter because, Sage, Sage, we just... You know what? I have an idea. Get out. Get out of my house. Okay? -We're just gonna... -If you force me to leave now... -Yeah? -do you think that'll solve this apparent world-record... pickle that you're in? Mm-hmm. Do you have any more of that 30-year scotch? Okay. Sage. Maybe we should come to some kind of agreement. -Okay? -Mm-hmm. Let's see. -Your terms are... -Mm-hmm. ...that I leave and vanish from your life completely. -Yeah. Good so far. -Mm-hmm. My terms are that you and I leave right now and start a brand-new happy and exciting life. I see no middle of the road on this map. That's because you need to recalculate your GPS. -Oh, come on, Reid. -It's a little off. Does nothing about us sound even the teensiest bit... appealing? -Not really, no. -You hesitated. -No, I didn't. -You did. -No, I didn't. -You did. -No, I didn't. -Did. -Didn't. -Did. -Didn't. -Did. -Didn't, did, did, did, did. -Did, did, did, did, did. -Did, did, did. -Did, did, did, didn't. -Got you. -Okay. Let's just -- Let's just stop. -Mm... -Let's just stop. Okay? -No. -Have you eaten? Do you want to -- Do you want to order something? Yeah. I'm not that hungry. I drank a lot. Oh, and maybe if I have enough to drink... I'll let you... That was a fun night. Wasn't it? Yes, it was. How about Chinese? Oh, sushi. Yeah. Oh, come on, Reid. Come on. You know you want some sushi. How about Jackal's Palace? Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. Don't you have that ordering app? Let me go get your phone. Where is it? Don't worry, Reid. Stop worrying. I'll just take care of you. Everything will be fine. Ugh! Oh, Reid. What the fuck? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. One. Two... Okay. That's better. That's better. That's worse. Okay. All right. Um... Okay. All right. Okay. No more stairs. Good. Good. Okay. Next house gonna be a single story. Okay. Okay. All right, Reid. Everything's gonna be fine. Yeah, it is. Okay. Too familiar. Okay. Here. All right. Let's get the things with the... That's solid. Okay. So there. And then we'll... There we go. Okay. There we go. Okay. Okay. Here we go. How do they do it in the movies? It's like -- Nope. You'll have a bruise. Wait. Good. Okay. And... ♪ Lullaby ♪ ♪ And good night ♪ Solid. Yeah. Good. Good. You're comfortable? Okay, all right. Mm-hmm. Okay. Come on, come on, come on. What's up, chicken butt? Yeah! Yeah! It's so good to see. It's so good. Um, you know, I'm just -- Are you okay? Ah, yeah. Yeah. I'm super-fine. I'm super-great. In fact, I'm just -- Not fine. Actually not fine at all. What is it, Reid? I need your help. Okay? Simple as that, really. But I need you to listen. Okay? 'Cause I have things to say. Where do I begin? Uh, fuck, I cheated on Carly. So there's that. Um... Yeah. Who? What the hell? Yeah. Are you... You're serious. Who? I tried to tell you earlier actually. The Sacramento client? That's the one. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's her? The rich man's wife? Boom! Yeah, you got it. Wow. You are sleeping with the rich man's wife. -What the hell, dude?! -Yeah. So it -- it all started after we finalized the deal with the big bosses up north, and they all took us out to dinner because, you know, that's what they do. The wife joined us, you know, 'cause she was bored. So she came down, and we were all having dinner. I had a lobster, by the way. Really delicious. I think they flew it in from Alaska. But, anyway, so we were having dinner, and the bosses wanted to -- They wanted to go barhopping. But, you know, -- So I said, "No." And you know what? The wife did, too. She didn't want to go out. She doesn't like barhopping either. I guess we have that in common. That's really great. So she decided to stay, and the husband gave her his key, and, well, you know, the entire time, we were just -- She was kind of giving me these looks. Oh, and you looked back? -Yeah. -Why'd you look back, man? You never look back. There was something about the way the light might have hit her eyes, and -- No, she was hot. She was hot. That was it. She was just -- Reid! Just because a woman's hot doesn't mean you should go sleep with her. I know! Right? Thank you for that. Oh, come on. You know what I mean. I just need your help on this. Okay? So, what, this has been going on since what? Like a week before the virus happened or... Well, look, I-I... You know what? I don't think this is something I should be getting in the middle of. Do you understand? I'm good friends with you, but I'm also good friends with Carly and I don't want to be... Ever since we started working together, -I just--You know, this is just -You know what's great? Is, I actually -- I don't need your help telling Carly. No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Well, then what is this about? I-I... I did something. Yeah, I'll say. No, no, no, not that something. No, a different something entirely. Okay. Reid! Reid, is she in your house right now? Uhhhh.... -Kind of. -Okay. Let me break this down for you. She is either in your house, or she's not in your house. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Kind of maybe sort of, um, did something. Did a thing. Did a thing. Yeah. Reid! Uh-huh, uh-huh You know what, though? Harriet, it's actually gonna be better if I show you, so, yeah. Stand by. Hold the line. Okay. Okay. This dude. All right, Harriet, just don't panic. Okay? What in God's name, Reid? Reid, what the hell is the matter with you? Let me out of this. I'm not gonna do that. -You have to let her go. -I can't. Let me go! Let her go! This is insane. It's completely insane. How dare you do this to me? Have you lost your freaking mind? If you think that by doing this, you're somehow off the hook... She's bleeding! Oh. Shit. I am, Reid. Okay. I see that. Just hold on. I'm gonna help you. Thank you, Harriet. Oh, God. Okay. Here's the -- Yes. Thanks. Just give it to me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Wow. Grateful much? I'm sorry. Really? Yeah. Really? Yes. You handcuff me to a bed... Uh-huh. ...and you're sorry about the fact that -you cracked my skull open?! Okay, okay. Oh, yeah. She's got a point. Well, whose side are you on, Harriet? Because it should be mine. Okay? Friends. We're friends here. And you know what? That is beside the point, because all this yelling, everyone's getting really excited, and I'm getting a little confused. How are you confused about this, Reid? I'm confused. I have every right to be confused because you FaceTime me to show me some random woman you're sleeping with that you've knocked out, handcuffed to your bed, and what's next? What, has she threatened to tell Carly? See, that -- That's the problem, see? Because we had a nice little agreement in place that when Carly would return, that we'd be done, and we would end this whole thing. Remember that agreement? That was a good agreement. Oh, I'm sorry. That agreement was a very gray area. I just want to point that out. It was not a gray area. -It was black and white. -Very gray. -Black and white. -Mnh-mnh. Reid! Can we talk a minute in private in another room? Excuse me. Gray area. Okay. Yes? That's all you have to say for yourself? Well, you wanted to talk about something, so here I am. -What? -Um... you're the one who needs to be doing the talking, dumb-ass. Harriet, now, calm down. 'Cause I tried to tell you what was going on. She's crazy, off her rocker. You can see that, right? You can see that, clearly. So I need you to help me. What do I do? It's very simple, Reid -- Let her go. I'm not gonna do that. That's -- No, no. 'Cause if I do that, then she's gonna go do... Right, right, right. I get the predicament. -And? -Look, I don't know. I have to think about this. Okay? This is very intense for me, and -- and... Okay, here's the thing. I love you guys. I love you and Carly. Clearly I don't want to see Carly hurt, but this, this is a serious, heinous crime, you realize? I know. I know. Thank you for that update. Serious crime. Got it. Great. How much have you been drinking tonight? I would really, really think that the current predicament would actually exactly tell you exactly how much I had to drink tonight, okay? I mean, why? Were you unhappy or something? What do you mean? The engagement. Carly. I mean, something seriously bad must have happened for you to do something like this. Uh... Um, well... ...I'm not lying when I say that the happiest day of my life was when I asked Carly to marry me. Okay? And I'm pretty sure it was the happiest day of her life, too. But since then, it seems as though she's planning a wedding that I'm not even a part of. She's kind of in her own little world, and I'm just gonna be some guy that shows up. That's very frustrating because I don't think either one of us has been happy since I proposed. So I lost myself in work, you know, like you do, thinking maybe, "Oh, just cold feet, or I'm just nervous about something." But it just kept bugging me. And truth be told, Carly and I haven't really been together since the beginning of the year. Like, been together, you know? So Sage comes along, and suddenly I'm getting some kind of amazing attention that I didn't get even a little bit of, and I fucked up. I did. You could blame it on the quarantine or any of that, but no, no, no. I just screwed up, and the thing is, I'm gonna tell Carly about what I did, but she can't find out this way because that's not fair to her. You know? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Look, I can't believe I'm gonna help your sorry ass here, but I am, but just know that this is for Carly. Okay? I know. Thank you. Good. Thank you very much. Uh, Harriet, hold on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Ah! You stupid asshole! What? What? Oh, oh, what? -I'll scream. -Oh, will you? The neighbors will hear. Go ahead. You've been screaming the last two and a half months. They're not gonna care. They're not gonna call the cops. They haven't done it yet. Right? Right? But do it. Do it for me. Come on, come on. One more. Let me hear you scream. Come on. Come on. Come on. That's fine. That's what I thought. God damn it. Son of a -- Hello? How you doing, buddy? It's me. You didn't call me back. Just like I said you wouldn't. Get that thing you were in the middle of taken care of? Kind of sort of still in the middle of it. Thank you. Thank you for asking, though. Appreciate that. I gotcha. Listen, man. Can I call you back? Can I call you back later? Sounds me like you're in some sort of trouble, to be honest. Hey, Reid. Hello? Who is it? Look... No one, no one. Just hang on. Who's that? Who is that? No one. It's no one. I'm telling you. What? All right, all right. I'll let you go. You just give me a call whenever you figure out whatever it is you're trying to figure out over there. I just -- I just can't... Hang on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere until we have a talk. Okay? Screw you! Take these off! Okay, okay. Stop it. Stop it. Shut up and let me think, okay? Let me think. What is there to think about? Uh, uh, uh, us... Okay. ...actually. All right. Yeah. Let's talk about us. Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Why don't you kick us off then? Let's do that. You kick us off. Why did you start banging me? That's a good kick. Reid? Reid, buddy? What? What is it? I don't know. I think he put the phone down. Someone's yelling. Hello? Who's there? Who's on the phone? Who is this? Um, Reid FaceTimed me and set me down. I can see his phone. Are you the one who called him? Hello?! Well, I'm his friend. Who are you? I'm also his friend. Who are you? No. Who are you? No, no. I asked first. What? First, second. Who cares? Tell me who you are. Oh, God. All right. Fine. I'm Harriet. I work with him. What, like, in sales? This whole whatever he does? Yeah. That is what he does for a living. Har-- What, what, what, what, what? What happened? Harriet? Remember the girl I told you about? The one behind door number one? I -- No shit. Hello? Harry Bottoms? Um... Stinking Lincoln? Harry Bottoms. Who's Harry Bottoms? Harry Bottoms. We used to... Stinking Lincoln? We used to make fun of our names. 'Cause we both -- I called her Harry Bottoms. She called me Stinking Lincoln. It was, like, a whole thing. I thought my name was better. Stinking... Yeah, I agree. Okay. Lincoln. Lincoln, is that you? It's been a minute. Huh? How the hell are you? Yeah, seriously. Like, what has it been? Like, two or five or... What is the actual number now? I can't believe this. Well, it's actually been seven, but... You've counted. No, no, never. You answered awfully fast. Sure sounds like you counted. Well, like you haven't been counting. Every day. Okay. Wow. Well, okay. So here's the thing. I am gonna skip the B.S. banter and just get right down to it. Do you miss me? You ask that as if you already know the answer. Oh, I think I do. Think I do. You -- You knew. You do, yeah. Yes, yes. Wow. Here it's been seven years. I can't believe this. I thought if I ever talked to you again, we would, like, ping-pong back and forth for hours before I'd work up the nerve to ask you that. But whoo! Swing! Home run! Got it right off the bat. Oh. Yeah, well, I always loved that about you, though. You were spontaneous. Oh, yeah. Well, you know what? I always liked that you were, um... nice. I always tried, I thought. Oh, my gosh. It is so good to hear your voice, Lincoln. I just -- Look, is there, uh... maybe any way that you could... pour yourself a drink? Oh, I can in about a minute or so. 'Cause I'm down here at this bar and I've got the kindest, coolest bartender, who's kept them coming for me all day long. And I guess I just thought that if I ever had the chance to have this conversation with you, it'd be best to catch up with the one that got away over a few stiff drinks. Oh, yeah. Just let me get a glass. Okay? So how in the hell do you come to know Reid? I mean, small world, right? Man. Let's see. I've been working with him for about five years now. Um, what about you? Yeah. He and I go way back actually. Yeah. High school. Sophomore year, we met. Are you kidding me? This is such a small world. All right. Cheer-- Oh, crap. Reid! Oh, right. Yeah. I guess he ditched us. Lincoln, do you have any idea what's been going on tonight? No. No. I just called him to follow up on getting together. We had talked earlier today, but he was in the middle of something. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, the something he was in the middle of wasn't just something. Well, what kind of something are we talking about here? It was a big something. How big a something? Like a ginormous something. That sounds like a big something. All right. Are you sitting down? All right. Give me the scoop on the something. Where does one begin with this? The scoop is, he's cheating on his fiancée with one of his clients' wives. Meanwhile, his fiancée is down in Dallas, visiting family. She got stuck down there with the lockdown and everything. And, you know, these other two, they've been sleeping together since the quarantine began. And I guess his side fling isn't ready to call the quits, So... Ah. So she's gone all "Fatal Attraction" on him. Yeah. From what I understand, he's in deep. Uh... I think she came over tonight, and he beat her unconscious and then handcuffed her to her bed, so... Gotcha. So what's the deal? Okay. So the one that got away is good friends with my old buddy. Now, my old buddy's been screwing around on his fiancée with some side hustle. Now, the side hustle is over there right now. And I'm guessing there was some kind of confrontation because he whacked her over the head and handcuffed her to a bed in his guest room. I'm guessing now he's at a quandary -as to what to do about it. -Yeah, gotcha. You ever hear of any shit like this? Worst I've ever heard was, a guy was pissed off at his mechanic. So he goes, he kidnaps the guy, and then he sends a threatening phone call to his wife and kids. How'd that turn out? Well, as I remember, he came in here for a drink. I'm cleaning glasses. I turn around, I look out the window. Guy's trunk opens up, and out jumps the mechanic, stark fucking naked. And he runs down the street. -He was naked? -Uh-huh. Ah, nice. Lincoln! Right, yes. I'm here. What's the plan? Do you think you can meet me down there? I'd love to. I don't exactly know where he lives, though. Okay. Have you changed your phone number in the last seven years? No. You know what? I had a feeling. I'll text you his address. Did you change yours? Nope. Um... Lincoln... do you ever think about calling me? All the time, darling. Really? That other girl back then, that was the... that was the wrong door to go behind. A mistake. Biggest mistake. My biggest mistake was letting you go. I'll see you over there, cowboy. Can't wait, milady. Whoo! Yes! ♪ I believe in miracles ♪ ♪ You came along ♪ ♪ You sexy thing ♪ ♪ You -- ♪ Oh, God! Gotta get ready. Well, guess I got to go. You guess? I think you know. Ahh! Certainly shaping up to be quite the evening, ain't it? Well, I bet it tops my mechanic story. You think? Well, let's see. This friend of yours, he's got this side hustle handcuffed in his guest room with his woman coming home tomorrow. And their best friend, who's trying to help him out of the jam, just happens to be the same girl that got away from you. Yeah. I think that's gonna be sitting at number one from now on. Yeah, maybe. Well, guess I better get to it. You know how one minute you're young and having fun, and the next you're turning down the car stereo so you can see better? So... basically you're saying you started screwing me because you were bored with your perfect relationship with your beautiful wife, who's the best thing that's ever happened to you. Oh, and also because you're getting old. No, you missed the point entirely, which doesn't surprise me 'cause you never listen. Mnh-mnh. In a nutshell, that's just what you described. That is in no way what I just described. Do you love her? Yes. Otherwise, you'd run away with me tonight. Do you want to marry her? Yes. Otherwise, you'd run away with me tonight. Does she take good care of you? Yes. Otherwise, you'd run away with me tonight. Does she fulfill your every need and is everything you've ever wanted in a woman, even though she's far from perfect? Yes. Otherwise, you'd run away with me tonight. And do you want to spend the rest of your life with her? Yes. Otherwise, you'd run away with me tonight. And you're all right with that? You would just want to run away with me tonight, huh? Just like a cheap paperback romance novel you find on the supermarket shelves. You know, just leave your husband, just like that? I never loved him. You know that. Right, right. The money. I get it. That's nothing. You'd just be done with that, too, huh? Leave that behind? Who said anything about leaving it behind? What are you planning? It's done. Trust me. Okay. Well... what about me is so appealing to you? I mean, aside from that night. 'Cause obviously that night, you know, big affair. It's exciting and all that stuff. But what are the qualities of me that you really want to run away with? You're normal. Normal? Oh, you want a different word? You're usual, you're standard, you're typical, you're ordinary, you're stock. -You're customary. -Okay. Okay. All right. But you'd want to leave behind a fantastic, undaunted, rich businessman? -Well, you're a businessman. -Okay. I do all right. I mean, look around. Yeah, I do okay. But your husband does triple this on a bad day. Oh, I'd say you do really, really well. Well is well enough for me. The truth is, years ago, I was with someone. You might say I convinced him to run away with me. And in the end, I tossed him aside. You know, that's really convincing me. You're saying you tossed someone else aside because that doesn't make me feel like a schmuck, that you're gonna pick up another normal guy that you're gonna pick up and toss aside again. -No, no, but, Reid... -Okay. ...it's different with you, though. Believe me, Sage... I definitely did see something in you. I mean, a guy who steps out on his fiancée finds something very, very unique, very eye-striking about you. You were intrepid. Mm. That night, sure. Yeah, absolutely. And even the few weeks after that, yeah, absolutely. And you know what? Maybe -- I don't know. Maybe blame it on the lockdown or blame it on something else. -I... -Mm. Yeah. Being locked up, being quarantined, being alone. Well... again, we started before that. Exactly. You definitely had something. Mm. You still have something. Something that Carly doesn't have. You're so... Now. ...vivid. I'm happy with this... description of me. No, no, no. No. You really don't want to say no to me. The fact of the matter is, I do. I am, Sage, because, well, I love Carly. So you're willing to throw away a life of ease with me... ...just to spare her feelings? That's a sick question. You know that? Yeah, I do. What exactly do you mean, "a life of ease"? Hmm? Do you think your life is just going to continue, Reid? You cheated on your fiancée. She's going to find out. And on top of it all, you kidnapped me. I didn't kidnap you. What do you call this? This is temporary detainment. Oh, detainment? Hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. That implies that I'll be let go. And if, and when, I'm let go, what do you think I'll do then, Reid? Reid, my husband doesn't know I'm here. By the time he finds out, we could be... He doesn't know I took it. He has a safe upstairs. You might say I needed it. And he got a call to go to New York. You'd think with the world in lockdown, he'd take a break from work, but, alas... Anyway, he won't be back until next week. We could be on the other side of the world by then. He's out of town. And he doesn't know about you leaving. And he doesn't know about the money, and he doesn't know about us. Of course not. How much? $5 million. Just down -- Just down there? Mm-hmm. In the gym bag? Mm. What? Reid? Hey! Reid?! What are you doing? Reid, what are you doing?! What are you doing?! Did you think I was lying about the money? Yeah, I did. Well, now you know. No bullshit. You and me. That's the way it's gonna be. Mm. Oh, come on, Reid. Come on, come on, come on. Stop it. Oh, come on, Reid. You might as well uncuff me. We both know how this is going to end, one way or another. Oh, oh, oh. Do -- Do -- Do we? -Do we, though? Do we? -Ah, we do. Do we, though? We don't. Ah... We do. We don't. We do. We don't. Do. Do. We don't. We don't. Do. Do. Do. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Do. Do. Do. Do. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. -Do, do, do, do, do... -Don't, don't, don't, don't... Ah, shut up! I don't think you see it from my perspective. Let me just enlighten you. There is an opportunity for me. Yeah. Right. Well, what opportunity is that? Okay, so I don't know if you know this, but there's $5 million in a sweaty little gym bag downstairs. No one knows you're here. No one knows about us. Your husband will suspect you as soon as he comes back. 'Cause why would he suspect me? I'm just some schmuck that he met on some business trip, -like, months ago. -Mm. I'm forgotten. I'm normal. So I'm forgotten. Okay, all right. And the only problem with all of that is... You. Exactly. Yeah. I know. I know. I know. I know. -You. -Uh-huh. But if... you know, you weren't in the picture anymore... What? In the picture? -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. -Okay. -Well, that's original. -Yeah. -That's super-original. -Yeah. Are you saying you're going to try to kill me? Uhh...oh, what if I am? I'd say that you're bluffing. What if I'm not? Oh, well, I'm calling it. Okay. Okay. How are you gonna do it? Are you gonna take a knife from the kitchen and stab me to death? Oh. How about this? A rope from the garage and strangle me. - Ooh! - Mm. Got an antique candlestick or a lead pipe? Maybe a revolver. -A wrench, perhaps. -Uh-huh. I'm really gonna miss the fact that you make board game references. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. That's nice. That's really nice for me. Just trying to add a little more humor to your already hysterical plan of murdering me and trying to get away with it. Don't think I won't. Ohh! Oh, my God. Oh, Reid. Reid. Quit looking at me like that. Who are you -- Jack Nicholson now? Oh. Oh. Are you, like, gonna "Who's Johnny" me? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Hey, stranger. Hey. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, yeah, let's -- You don't got the COVIDs, do you? I've spent all afternoon in a bar. -I can't promise anything. -Come here. Oh, my gosh. I cannot believe it. I don't think I can either. I have something. I have something to show you. Oh? I... Okay. Okay, close your eyes. Ah. I present to you Staples Center... -March 3, 2012. -Yeah. -One of my favorite nights. -Mine, as well. If we'd only known the year they'd end up having, huh? Yeah. It's my favorite keepsake. Well, I've never known a player to give a broken stick to a couple of fans. -Well. -But... -Carter's cheap, I guess. -Yeah. I can't believe you still have yours. -Of course. -Wow. You know, when we...ended, that wasn't good. And that was on me. -That was not... -Oh. -No, that wasn't... -Yeah, no, no, no, no. It's -- You know what? I-I always understood that whoever she... she was, you know... It was stupid. It's what you... you know, what you... -Yeah. -Um... Actually, though, I... There is something that's kind of bothered me... ...all these years I have a question about. Um... You know that one night, that long night when we drove up to the Palisades? Oh, yeah. You know, we had just left that cute little beachside bar. -Mm-hmm. -I, um... Well, I, you know, said that I loved you, and I was just kind of wondering if that maybe got in the way of things. Yes. Oh. Then. That's key. -Because now it -- -Yeah. You know what? You know what? We don't have to talk about this right now. I just realized that Reid is in there -and there's some kidnapped lady -Right. Of course. -and it's a whole situation. -Let's do... And we probably should help him with that, and... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. -We'll come back to this. Let's -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And get that situated, and then we'll get, -you know, back to us, you know? -Mm-hmm. -Oh, my purse. My purse. -Get your purse. Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. I mean, I think this is a great area and everything, but... Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, let's go. Come on. This way, this way, this way, this way. -Oh, oh. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on. Come on. Okay. Down. Down. Huddle. -What's going on? -Let's get a huddle. -Are you okay? -Yeah. Yeah. Hey, I saw your car coming. Okay? Thanks for coming. Oh, boy. Thanks for coming. -Hey. Hey. Why are you here? -Hi. Hi. Oh. You were kind of talking to both of us. -Remember, drunkie? -Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. Great. Good. You look like hell. You look like crap. Thank you. Thank you. Likewise. Likewise, asshole. -Okay, good. -You smell like Jack. So we're gonna do this now. Are you ready? -Really? Thank you. -Maybe we should just... -I wasn't drinking Jack. -That's okay, that's okay. It's not the best time to catch up. No, no, no, no. It's the perfect time. -I'm very concerned. -Stop. Stop, stop, stop! I'm very concerned. I know you're concerned. I know you're concerned. You're gonna be less concerned in a minute, I promise. -Okay. Are we going -- -Hands in. Hands in. Hands... Okay. I don't know what we're doing. Ready? On three. We're gonna go, "One, two, three. Go, team!" Go, team. Oh, okay. So, where is she? Upstairs. Reid? -We got to... -This is gonna be fun. Yeah. It gets better. You do realize this isn't gonna be the easiest of situations to resolve here? Oh, yeah. Super-aware of that, but, you know -- I mean, you got any bright ideas there? -I have one, I have one. -Oh, okay. But it's gonna require a little show-and-tell. So I want you to look in the bag. -Right there. Yeah, it's okay. -Oh, great. -It's okay. It's okay. -Do I really want to know? Yeah. Yeah, you do. It's not that kind of bag. Mm, mm... Jiminy Christmas. How much is in here? $5 million. -Really? -Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Here's the kicker, though -- Husband doesn't know about us, so subsequently does not know that she is here. Hm. Reid, that is seriously not why you called us here today. I am not helping you with that. Reid! There she goes again. That... Who is that? -The girl. -It's the... I don't know. What is he doing? Lincoln. Sage. -Wow. -Lincoln. Lincoln, Lincoln. Help me, help me. You got to -- You got to get me out of this. -This man is crazy. -Okay. Okay. -Okay. Hey. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. -Adults are talking. Okay, okay. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. -Just wait a second. What? -Hey. This is your quarantine booty call? No, I'm keeping another girl in the other room over there. Yes, of course it is. How do you know her? Mm, mm... Um, Lincoln, what is going on here? Lincoln? Like familiarity, like you know him. How do you know him? How do you know Lincoln? Oh, um... She and I kind of caught up earlier when we were on the phone with you and then you kind of just disappeared. Remember that? Right, right. So now you're best friends? That's how it works? You're quick to make friends. -No, but, um... -Quick, quick. Seven years ago or so, I was actually living in L.A. -Oh, of course you were. -And I never told you. I know. Didn't tell me. Why would I have to know that? Anyway, she and I were...kind of an item, I guess you could say. An item. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it. We were sort of together, kind of, maybe. -Yeah. -Wait, hold on. So together seven years ago. So you had talked about, like, a major, like, love interest years and years ago. That's Lincoln, isn't it? All this time, Carly's been trying to get this out of you, -just rip it from you, and... -You know what? And it's him. It's him. I'm just having a little problem with this -'cause it's kind of weird. -You know what? -You know what? You know what? -Him. -It's -- -This guy. He's got a couple of good qualities. I do. You're acting like I got nothing. What is -- Come on. I mean, I'd like to hear about them, Actually a lot of good qualities. How is it surprising? You know what? You know what? This, Reid -- This is really none of your business, okay? Okay, well, it is my house, but who cares? My house. I think we need to get back to the more important question here. Who is she, and why do you know her? What is going on? That's actually a really good point. -Yeah. -That was my first question. I'm sorry. That's really none of your business. -Excuse me? -Yeah, hurts, doesn't it? I don't know who you are, but... But what? But what? What? Oh, if I were handcuffed to a bedpost, honey, I wouldn't be throwing any "buts" around, okay? -Okay. Okay, you know what? -Lincoln? Lincoln? I think we need some drinks, right? -No. No, no. -We need some drinks? Um...I can do this. Uh, wow. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. -Reid. -Yeah? Let me introduce you to the woman who sent me on the infamous downward spiral all those years ago. -That's great. That's great. -What? -Amazing. I love this. -And, Harriet, let me introduce you to the girl who, well... -The one who... -Hi. -So this, this, this, this is... -Yeah. This is Christmas. That's what this is. This is Christmas for me. This is really good. I'm gonna be sick. This is great. This is great. This is good. This is good. Harriet, would you like to polish off a whole entire bottle of tequila that I've been saving for a special occasion? -I'll take several shots. -I think so. She's a tequila girl. You probably knew that. -Okay. All right. -Okay. I'll be waiting. -Mm... -Um... Go down, have a drink. Or 2. Or 10. What are you gonna do? I'll be down in a minute. Right. Okay. Nice to meet you. So... So... Bit of an awkward reunion. Tell me about it. So, what, you start banging Reid, and you come over here, and his fiancée's coming home tomorrow, and you won't leave, and he beats you unconscious and does this to you? Did I hear that right? That's the gist. The things some of us go through during quarantine, huh? Yeah. Oh, Lincoln. You always had a way with words to lighten the mood. I don't know that there's any lightening this mood, Sage. This is some pretty dark shit going on here. So, what, you leave me, run off with some rich guy, screw around with him for a few years, and then you want me back, the simple life. But instead of me, you go to Reid? I didn't know you knew him. It's a small world. Very. And the girl... -is she the... -Yep, that's her. -She was the one? -That's her. Oh. Microscopic world. Hold on. What are you doing? Hold on. -Kelsey's Pub. -Hey, it's me. -Me? Who's me? -Me, the guy from earlier. The guy looking to top your crazy shit list. Yeah, yeah. Sure, kid, sure. What's going on out there? Quick update. That little side hustle -my buddy's been banging? -Yeah? Same girl that was behind door number two for me. Get the fuck out! As God is my witness. Jesus Christ. Well, that's -- that's just too good, kid. That's just too good. You're telling me. Anyway, okay, I'll call you later, all right? Yeah, please do. All right. I'll see you. Really? You want to -- I don't know... maybe call the cops while you're at it? -You know I'm not doing that. -Okay. Okay, Reidy-Schmeidy, let's get this party going. You got it. You got it. Okay. Let me just find a glass here. Real quick. You know what's funny? You, you and that girl upstairs, you have something in common. -That's fun. Have some of this. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. Can it, okay? That was years before we worked together. And I didn't even know you two were pals. Okay. We were, like, way back in high school. -There you go. Real far back. -Mm! Good. Good. Good. Good. Back in high school, a little bit in college. Then he went off to be a great filmmaker. And we all know how that one turned out. Super-successful, right? Well, I don't think he had a lot of friends, okay? Like, I get it. I get the situation. Just... Okay, okay. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Knock it. Knock it. There it is. Good. That's good. That's good. -Mm! -Nice, nice. Good. Good. You know what? You need to lay off of him a little bit, okay? -Mm-hmm. -He's great. Like, him and I were great together. We worked, we had fun. I don't know if you've ever noticed this, Reidy-Schmeidy, but I'm not the coolest girl ever, okay? I got weird jokes. People find me annoying, but Lincoln, Lincoln gets me. -Okay. Okay. -Okay? Only problem was, you know, back then, we -didn't make things exclusive. -Mm. ...and that wicked witch upstairs, -the home-wrecker she is... -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. crept into his life and... long story short, he chose that...whore. Okay, okay. That's good. That's good. Again, I just, I mean, it's funny to me. I don't know if you're getting my perspective on this, but -it's Lincoln with two women. -Mm-hmm. Two women for Lincoln. Two. It's the two of you. Two. Dos. Dos equis. Dos. "Wow" is all I have to say. Mm. Okay. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Coming from the man who is in the most fucked situation any man's ever been in. I do, I do. Thank you. You're fucked. You're fucked, Reid. Thank you. Thank you. Like... ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la ♪ -You're fucked. Yeah. -Okay, I love that. You know what? Christmas carols aside, I'm open to suggestions 'cause that's why I brought you here. Go, go, go. -You and me go. -Well, okay. Guess what. I have a great suggestion. How about we do what you suggested earlier? What do you think? What do you think? What you do think? Earlier...Oh, oh! You mean the like, the murder thing. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Gone, dead. Dead, dead, deadski. You know? Okay, okay, okay. Well, just spitballing here, but how? How -would you do--How? How? How? -Yeah. Yeah. -I would like to know how. -Oh, I have a great idea. Okay. I'd love to hear it. Love the enthusiasm. Love the enthusiasm. Let's hear it. Oh, okay. Okay. You take this. -That's good. That's good. -And on up we go. -Okay. All right. -Yeah. Well, you're insane. That's clear now. -Oh, no, no, no, no, no. -But love the enthusiasm. I'm in love, I'm getting drunk, -and I hate her. -Okay. -So that's... -Over Lincoln? Hate her -over Lincoln? That's the-- -Go. Just go. That's the fun thing about all of this. You should just grow a pair and go. -Okay. Okay. -Get it. Go. -You know what, though? -I think that's a good idea. You know what? I'm gonna stop you right there. Human being. Human being upstairs, okay? Let's just put that into perspective. I know a monster, but still a human being. -Yeah, let's think about -- Okay. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We can give her bleach. It's less painful. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't mean another suggestion. I meant, like, another way to go. Like another thing we can do that doesn't involve any murdering, death, or killing. I don't think you're thinking about this clearly. -Mm. Mm-hmm. Her dying? That's the only way you and Carly go back to being the way you were before this nightmare. You make it sound real simple. -Super-simple when you... -Oh, it is. It is simple. It's a simple concept. Kind of hard to execute, but, you know. I mean, Lincoln and I are here to support you. That's nice. That's super-nice of you. Yeah, yeah. I appreciate your friendships. So you would just walk right in... ...and then straight up just murder the shit out of her? Oh, oh, oh. Hell no. No, no, no, no, no. That's you, buddy. That's all you. Well, let's brainstorm 'cause I'm... Um...oh, like what we should do. -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. -Okay. Well, okay, clearly -- I'm not liking the knife. Too messy. -Knife is just too messy. -Okay, well, I mean, the bleach is gonna be messy, too, 'cause, blegh... Yeah, I know. She could purge it up, and then it's... I mean, who wants to deal with that? -COVID. COVID. Perfect. -COVID. -We suffocate her. -Sell me. We -- We tell them that she just had the COVIDs. Okay. I'm liking it so far. I'm liking it. The suffocation thing. That's a lot cleaner, for one thing. -A lot easier. -Yeah. But you know what the problem is? There's actually an incubation period of up to five days, -two days for the virus... -Wow. ...and then three -- I know. I learned this. I learned this. Google. Google magic. -Google magic. Okay. -Yeah. Yeah. Five days. So she would be symptomatic in five days and then maybe die within those five or six days. -All right, all right. -That's too long. We only have till tomorrow. -We could hang her upside down. -Okay. -Hang her upside down. -Make all the blood fl-- I guess that would take a long time. It might take a little while longer, too, yeah. The pool, the pool, the pool! -The pool. Okay, okay, okay. -We'll drown her. Make it look like an accident. -Aqua death. I like aqua deaths. -Yeah. Yeah, okay. So she... Okay, so what's the story here? -You know what? You know what? -What? What? We got all this alcohol. We could get her drunk. -Yes! Yes! -We get her super-drunk, super-duper-drunk, and then she drank so much, -and then she -- -She just, boom, drowns. -Here's the story. -Gone. Can't swim. So... how bad is it out there? It's bad. Most of my colleagues treat me like I don't even exist anymore, you know? I don't get phone calls returned, text messages, that kind of thing. Just doing these shit infomercials last seven years. I left that much of a mark on you, huh? A bit of a minor depression did occur when you left, yeah. But I got to say, most of that was because of what I gave up. Not because of you. Her? She's really something. Oh. Really something. And, you know, the thing is, I've been kicking myself all these years, and then I find out tonight she's been thinking the same thing I have ever since then. That's a lot of wasted time, Sage. But I'm not you. Well... sometimes life sneaks in through the back doggy door, you know? You could try owning up to it. I did. It felt pretty good. Lincoln, I'm sorry. That didn't really do for me what I thought it would do. -Lincoln, come on. I'm -- -Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, we're... Me, you... that's done. I'm over that. I just guess I always thought if I ever heard you say that to me, it would make me feel real good. And, instead, it's just kind of -- I don't know -- eh, take it, leave it, pbht. Lincoln. -Baby, I really didn't -- -Baby? Baby? Oh. Ouch. Look... you're stretching now, aren't you? You're getting desperate. I know when you get desperate. This has gotten desperate. Well, all right, Reid. We certainly got a situation on our hands, don't we? -Mm-hmm. -My ex, my other ex, your side hustle... and your girl's coming home tomorrow. -Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. -What are we doing? Well, we were thinking of killing her, so... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. -Yeah, that's the plan. -Yeah. -What are your thoughts? -Oh, okay, okay. What? Well, here's the thing. -Here's the sitch here. Okay. -Tell me. -So if he lets her go... -Mm-hmm. ...she's likely gonna go to the police and ruin his life... -Yeah. Yeah, that's bad. -and it's not a good -It's bad, it's bad. -situation at all. And if he agrees to the ridiculous demands... Insanity. he's gonna end up in a foreign country with her... -Right. -and we'll never see him again, -and it'll destroy Carly, and... -Equally as bad. ...seeing as how they're my nearest and dearest friends... Nearest and dearest. ...I don't want to see that happen. -Another big problem. -Right. Seeing as how you are still the love of my life, which is something we can talk about later, of course... -I'm not getting into this. -...and she... that whore kind of drove a wedge between us, I really, really, really, really don't like her... -Mm-hmm. -...so that's my motivation. It's pretty good motivation. It's about like mine, except for the "loving you" part... -Yeah. Mnh-mnh. -...'cause I'm not there. I'm not there. I'm not there, buddy. I'm just not. Okay. -Well, that's all insane, so... -No. ...maybe we can think of something else. I don't know about that. I think that's a pretty solid plan, right? I think that's, like, the clearest we've thought of. I mean, there's more to it, of course. -It's not just, like, "kill." -No. There's actually a whole story. You're gonna love it. It sounds like just dead, murder, you know, a human being. -It's the plot of a movie, man. -Give a second. You're gonna love this. Plot of a movie. Give me a second. -Kelsey's Pub. -Hey, what's up, buddy? So they want to kill her. -Kill her? -Yeah. Pretty sure that's it. Just kill her. Just dead. Just nothing. -Gone. Done. Out. -Yeah, yeah. I gotcha. Well, goddamn, kid. I knew you was going for the high score, but I think you're about to bust the bank here. I believe I would advise you against that. Right. Yeah, okay. Gotta go. Bye. S-S-Shit. So we just kill her? -Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. -Yeah. Pretty much straight up. I mean, it's a little more complicated than that. You're making it sound simple, but it's not simple. -Yeah. -It doesn't seem that much more complicated than how you're saying it. Well, there's a lot of moving pieces to it. Yeah, but we planned it out. We planned it out. So in a nutshell, you've lost your minds. No, no, no, no. 'cause this sounds like the talk of someone who has lost their mind. As clear as clear can be. A long talk? You had a long talk about this? It's funny you should say all this stuff after all the shit that I've done for you. All the shit you've done for me? -Yeah, yeah. Okay, I don't think you've done -anything for me. -Oh, really? In fact, one might say you abandoned me. Okay. One might say. One might say that. One might say that. I'm not saying it. Who would that one be, exactly? Is that the one that's gonna be the guy who was my best friend back in high school Uh-huh. Here it is. ...who was kind of my friend in college, but then he decided to take one fucking film class so that he could become the next, what was it, Martin Scorsese? I think it was Scorsese, or Spielberg, or David Fincher, or maybe it was Nora Ephron. I don't know. Maybe you're a little more of a "You've Got Mail" kind of guy. I don't know about that, but either way, he decided to pick up and move all the way to, what, Connecticut of all places? Why? Because there was a Middlesex Film Commission director's spot available? 'Cause I don't remember that ever being on the roster of film locations, New Hollywood wave. Maybe that's just me. I don't know. Maybe that's just me. But what ended up being the case? I think you were, what was it, a second unit A.D. on a "micro-budget feature film," which we all know in Middlesex would be a... -Porn shoot. -Porn, porn, yes. That was my bad. How would I know? -How would I know? -How would you know? Gee, I don't know. I don't know. Maybe when someone's unzipping their pants -during the audition process. -You were doing porn? -It was a one-time thing. -Okay. The point is there, Scorsese wannabe, it was 15 years, and in all that time, you maybe sent me some e-mails about some crowdsourcing stuff that you wanted for some projects that you were trying to pitch to everyone else. So, yeah, real lovely, lovely stuff. Not even a "hello." Not even a, "Hey. How's it going?" -So screw you, okay? -Okay, maybe I abandoned you. -One might say. One might say. -One might say. I'm not saying it, but one might say. -One might say a lot. -Not me, -but one could say. -What? Right. One might just suggest. What would you call it? Maybe it was because I was the one who got by in school with a C average. - You were Mr. University. - Oh! -I was Mr. Community College. -Guys. Hey. Hey. -Hey, hey, hey. -You know what? The amounts of tears you're crying could just fill this entire valley. -Guys! Guys! Guys! -Okay. Whoa. Here. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Blah blah blah blah. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, I can't take this crap anymore. I know. He's awful. Isn't he? No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm awful? I'm awful? No, no, no. He's sorry. You're sorry. No, I'm not sorry. Don't put words in my mouth. Can you guys just, like, man up and shake hands? There you go. You guys are such good friends, like, lifelong buddies. We're here for an oh-so joyous occasion. Now... you go murder his sloppy seconds. I'm sorry. Sloppy seconds? -His sloppy seconds? -That's true. -I don't know about that. -I had her first. You had her second. That's the joke. Well, sometimes the chef gets it right on the second turn. You know what? You might want to refrain from the jokes, you know, if we're gonna have a future together. Me okay, you not so much. Okay. Fair enough. Would you go yell at him? Now, now, real quick, real quick. Are you guys okay with this? 'Cause I'm okay with this. Obviously I'm all right. Perfectly all right with doing this. But I didn't know if you were okay with it. -I'm all right with it. -Can you live with it? -Can you live with it? You know -But I'm not okay with it. what? I don't care if you're all right with it. You're gonna walk up there and stab her to death, and that's just gonna be it? Maybe something a little more clever than that. I don't know. I don't know. Some kind of... You have a knife in your hand, you're gonna walk upstairs. -What else is there to it? -Okay, okay, fine. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it, okay? Now, just remember, you guys are accomplices. You're the accomplices. -Straight, shoulders back. -No, no, no, no. Okay, okay, okay. I need the knife. I need the knife. -Give me the knife. -You got it. -Thank you for giving me knife. -Careful. -I appreciate that. -I'm a good guy here. Okay. So I'm gonna go do this. All right. -Yeah. -I'm gonna go do this. If you've got the cojones, go do it. Of course I have the cojones. I've always had the cojones. You're still here talking. You're still here talking. There's only two cojones and I've got them both, so... -Then go. -You got it. You got it. -Then go. -Okay, okay. I'm gonna go. Okay. You're not going. -You're stalling. -You guys want to come watch? You guys want to watch this? 'Cause it's gonna be epic. It's gonna be pretty amazing. -Go. -You don't want to watch? -No. -Okay. Fine. Fine. Fine. I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it like a car bonnet. You've got this. You've got this. Whoo! Shit. Um... -Yeah, I can't do it. -Oh, thank God. -Nope. Nope. -Oh, thank God. Nope, nope. Not gonna do it. -Come on, man. -I can't do it. -Mnh-mnh, mnh-mnh. -Exactly. You can't just go up and kill this woman. I know she is who she is, but... You didn't want me to do it either, did you? -Of course not! -Yes, I did, I did. But I couldn't do it. You wanted him to do it? -It just... -I couldn't do it. -It got so real. -Super-real. -Yes. -Yes. -It got totally real. -When you picked up the knife, then I was like, "Oh, God. What have I done?" I felt like a badass, though. Like, I felt like a badass. You were a badass. Like, I had the knife, and I was like, "I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go" But then I thought, "You know what? -It's probably not me." -You were such a badass. -It's the alcohol. -I don't think so. -Reid, Reid. You gotta -It's the liquid courage. -go talk to her. -Yeah, I know. I know. Yeah. Let's all go talk to her. That's actually the best idea this guy's ever had in his life. -Let's all go talk to her. -That's not a bad idea. I could use some backup. My friends. I don't have anything else to say to her. You lead the way. You lead the way. Come on, come on. We got to help him out. Come on. It's gonna be okay. -Come on, guys. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. ...say to her. -Oh, shit. -What? Oh, God. Oh, boy. Looks like she lubed her way free. Yep. The old slip and lube. That'll do it. -Oh, God. -You know what? I'm really looking forward to the day that John Wilkes Booth shoots you in the back of the head. That's gonna be a good day. And you say you're not mad, huh? -Well... -Oh, this is just great. She's gone, guys. What the hell are we supposed to do now? Gone? Harriet, she's not gone. -No. What do you mean?- She's gone. She's still here. How do you know? Hmm? Hmm? Yeah. You satisfied now? Houston, we have a problem. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. We should... Yeah. -Okay. -Let's get this wicked witch. I'm totally getting a Scooby-Doo mystery vibe. -Wait, wait, wait. -Take it easy. Take it easy. I've got to get my light. I've got to get my light. All right. Are we ready to call the police yet? We're not gonna call the police. -That's a terrible idea. -Yeah. No police, ever. Okay. In case you haven't noticed, she's now cut the power to the house. When did she do that? You know as well as I do that she's a wacko. Okay. Wacko's a good word to describe her. Wacko's an understatement. She's a psychopath. No, no, no. I like the word "wacko." Psychopath's, you know, just played out. Oh. She's a wacko-path. Wacko-path. I like that. That's good. That's good. I like that. I like that a lot, actually. Wacko-path. Wacko-path. Oh, hold on. -Oh, oh. Yeah, yeah. -Oh, my God. Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush! Okay, okay, okay. Hello, Sage? See what you've gone and done now, honey? You've made this incredibly complicated. Yeah, well, okay. You might have a point there. Yeah, all right. Those two, those two friends of yours... they know now. What do you mean, "they know now"? Are you saying that if I ran away with you, then I wouldn't be able to associate with my friends? That's very controlling. I don't like being controlled like that, Sage. Kind of weird. Connections to your ex-fiancée would be unhealthy, Reid, hon. Oh, we're gonna talk about unhealthy now. You are gonna lecture me on unhealthy. That's cute. That's cute. - Outside. - Yeah. Just keep her on the phone, okay? Come on. Come on. Come on. Don't try to be witty, hon. It doesn't suit you. Yeah. Don't call me "hon" anymore. That's a stupid nickname. I don't like it. It's like when people call each other "babe." I hate that word, too. I don't know why. I hate them. So, what, hon? What's your plan? Are you and I gonna start being you and I? Or are you gonna try to kill me? Those are really your only two options, and those two friends of yours that you sent outside to go look for me, they're really not gonna help you and me. Okay. You know what? I have an idea. Why don't we leave my friends out of this, huh? We could just send them on back, and it could just be you and me. Just you and me. You and me, Sage, huh? What do you say to that? 'Cause I like that idea. I think it's a good idea. It's a really fantastic idea. It can be the adventures of Reid and Sage. What do you say? I wanted it just to be you and me, and it's going to be you and me. I'm not crazy. Reid, I'm totally not. Got it? I know it might seem like I'm acting like a nutty chick in some Friday night Lifetime Network movie. But I promise you, I'm totally sane. Cut the crap, Sage. Come on. Stop it. Listen to me. Face it, hon -- I am in control here. Okay. Okay. Over there. Across the pool, by the solar lights. Oh, yeah, I see that. There's something over there. Do you think it's her? Maybe. Let's go check it out. -I'll go around. -Okay. -Lincoln, wait. Wait, wait -What? What? What? She's insane, you know? Yeah, of course I know. I mean, we could die tonight. Yeah, I suppose we could. This could be it. It could. I, um... I don't want to have any regrets, Lincoln. No. No, no, no. Regrets aren't good. No. No. No, no. I've had a regret for seven years. This is corny, isn't it? Yeah. Very corny. Do you care that it's corny? I don't care at all. No. It's fine. If, um... I were to tell you right now that I loved you, would that get in the way again? Oh. Bottoms, when we were together... Yeah? ...all those years ago, those were -- Those were the best. Those nights, you know, the Palisades. -Long nights. -Beautiful nights. You know what I do to pass the time now? What? -I go to bed early. -Mm. I don't like going to bed early. Well, you know, it's getting kind of late right now. I love you. Mm. That was a weird lead into that, wasn't it? It was very weird. We also just kissed during a pandemic. Are we supposed to do that? I don't know, but I love breaking the rules with you. Are you scared? -Oh, terrified. Terrified. -Me too. -That's probably the reason. -Oh, yeah, yeah. Let's go find what's her name before she kills Reid. Oh, yeah. After you. Let's find her. Hey, Sage, let me ask you something. Just being serious here. Do you get, like, a sick pleasure screwing with people's lives? You know, me, Lincoln, your husband, probably your parents. -Aah! God! Mm, okay. The man cheating on his fiancée is gonna judge me. One, two, three. Damn it. Maybe she went out front. -Oh, wait a second. -What? I seriously doubt she cut the power. -The breaker boxes! -Oh. She probably just shut them off. -I think I know where they are. -All right. Okay, since I'm the fast one, I'll run and go. Come on. You know this. I'm gonna go shut them on. You go check on Reid, because he needs help, so... Should we be splitting up like this? Come on. Fair enough. I'll be back. Yeah, I'm sure you will. -Come on, tiger. -Okay. Good night. Reid? Huh? Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Hey, hey, hey! Let's not go outside. Come on, come on, come on. Have a snack. Have a snack. Maybe some tea. We'll just figure this out. -I don't want a snack. -Okay. All right. Okay. I had pretzels. Carly, Carly, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? I got home early to surprise you. -Surprise! -Yeah, I know. Super-surprised. -Why is Harriet's car out front? -Yeah, okay, okay. -Yeah, yeah. -And who's the other car? Good questions. Good questions. Yeah. -And why is the power off? -Well, well, well... And whose bag is this? Reid, what the hell is going on? -Need police, okay? -The police?! -Yes. -Aah! Who the hell is that?! -Oh. That, that's just a client. -A client? Yes. Yes. -Reid, what is going on here? -Where's your phone? -Where's your phone? -It's in my bag. I put it in my bag before I got out of the car. Why would you do that?! Because I didn't know I was walking into a home invasion! Okay. We got to be prepared for these things. Why would I prepared for a home invasion?! I don't know. These are the kind of things that happen when you least expect them. Okay? What is going on?! They don't plan these in advance. -It's not like "Home Alone." -Reid. Hold on to your butts. You got this, girl. That's got to be. Hang on. Hang on. Okay. I'm not going out there with a crazy lady. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! You need a weapon. A knife. There's a knife by sink. Go by. Go get it. -A knife? -Go, go, go, go, go, go. Just use your feels, baby. Use your feels. Okay, watch your cute-cutes. Watch 'em! Watch your cute-cutes. No. Don't cut them. Don't cut them. Good. Yes. Do you hear? Do you see it? Do you feel it? Where is it? You got it? You got it? Good. Let's go outside. Come on. Come on. Oh. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Sage. Sage. Sage. Sage. -Don't. -Sage, Sage. Sage, Sage. Sage, Sage. Come on now. 6 feet. Right? Wear the mask. Wear the mask. I'll admit this has escalated just a little bit. Oh, yeah, yeah. Escalated. That's kind of putting it mildly, I would say. All right. So it's blown through the fucking roof. -Whatever. -Reid, who is this? Oh, you wouldn't know who I am, sweetie. What do you want? Oh, nothing you can give me. Sage, let her go. Okay? Just let her go. Let her go, Sage. -Come on. -Oh, Reid. I think you know what needs to happen now, yeah? Don't do this. Come on. Come on now. Why don't you tell her about us, honey? Reid. Okay, Reid, I'll tell her. You've been gone a long time, sweetie. He and I, well, you might say... we broke quarantine. Oh, come on now, sweetie. Sage. Look, we're done, okay? We're over. We're through. It was a mistake. It was a terrible, terrible mistake, okay? Carly, Carly, it was a terrible mistake. Oh, my God, guys. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. -I'm -- Aah! -Shush, shush, shush, shush. Oh, my God. What's going on? I heard a scream. -His fiancée is back. -Oh, my God. The garage, it leads to the kitchen, right? -There's a door in there. -Oh! Yeah, there's a code. -There's a code. -Open the door. Open the door. -Come on. -Is this what you want to do? You talk about me throwing away my life. Is this what you want to do to throw away your life? You want to do this to her? 'Cause this is gonna end your life. Okay? This is it. This is it, Sage. You know, the first night I met him, there was this perpetual bliss in the air. We went home together that night. We went home here, in this house. And again. And again. Oh, and again, and again, and again. Reid! -No, no. -Oh, remember how I kissed you? Don't listen to her. Carly, it's okay. Carly, it's gonna be okay. You always did like that, didn't you? Carly, Carly, Carly. It's gonna be okay. Blame it on the COVID shutdown, Reid, if you want. It's all right. That you were bored and nothing to do. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. Carly. -That's all bullshit. -It's okay. -It's gonna be okay. -Nothing to do. -Shut up! -It's gonna be okay. Shut up! You and I started this thing before that thing. Your sweet fiancée here wasn't gone two days, and what do you do? Aah! Damn it! Oh, okay. Go on! Go fish, bitch! You dropped your favorite toys. Okay? All right? Give me those. Oh. Yeah, stay. Hey, don't move. Come on. Tight as they go, Carly. Okay. There you go. Nice moves, Car-Bar. O'Shar. Would someone please tell me what is going on here?! -Okay, okay. -And who are you? -I'm Lincoln. Good to meet you. -Oh. You know what? It's not the time. You don't have to listen to him. I'm just saying. We came all the way... He's probably a little bit drunk. I'm real glad you made it in safe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Super-glad you made it. -Yeah, the flight was great. -You came in early. -What happened? -I did come in early. Yeah, exactly. What happened? Who is this guy? You brought a date to a crime scene? No, no, no, no, no, no. -Shh. Okay. -You're all talking at once. I cannot hear you. What happened? Okay, well, one of us should just tell the story. -Okay, Reid. -What? This is Lincoln. He's the love of my life from seven years ago. Why none of my relationships have ever worked out. -Can we shake now? -No, we cannot shake. -Okay. -Yeah, don't touch his hand. -This is the guy? -Yeah, this is him. -Yeah. And, anyway... -Okay, we... ...I called him because I'm back and I was at a bar all day drinking. Why are!? And he was wigging out, and I came over -- You guys! Somebody has to tell me what's going on here! Why is there a girl in my kitchen?! She's psycho. I see that. I don't need you to tell me that. Oh, my God. Then she gets a little wacky. And I had a little bit too much to drink. Yeah, we invented a word for her, which is "wacko-path." -Harriet's word, really. -Well, yeah. Maybe we should call the police. -Guys. Guys. -What? That's our luck, isn't it? Ohh. That's great. -Yep. -It is great. She really is gone this time. Well, this time. -Typical Sage. -Not forever. Yeah. She's not coming back after I threatened her with a knife, right? -No. -Well... You did threaten her with a knife. I'm so sorry. It was good to see you again. Let's do this again in another seven years, yeah? We'll do something a little different next time. Maybe go to a amusement park or something. I know. I'm just exhausted. I thought coming in early would be a good thing. -I'm gonna go call the police. -Yeah. That's a good idea. You know what? I'll help you out. Okay. All right, so unfortunately it seems like we can't get ahold of her husband. He was supposed to be on business in New York. We contacted the hotel, and he never checked in. We sent a unit over to his residence, and no one answered. Do you have any idea where she might be? No. That'll top it. Top of the list. I couldn't have made that up, not in my wildest dreams. Yeah, well, he's about to get the biggest ass chewing known to man. They gonna make it work? Probably not. Did he love her? Which one? Either, I guess. Crazy side hustle? Nah. His fiancée? I don't know. If I was to give a professional watering hole opinion, I'd say these are hectic times. People are cooped up. They don't know what to think. And as old Norman Bates used to say, we all go a little mad sometimes. This pandemic, well, maybe it drove him to it. Yeah, but they started this whole thing before the pandemic. Well, then it kept him busy. Gave him something to do. I'll tell you, it's a dangerous time to be a lover out there, kid. That's your professional advice? Ah, Jesus Christ. What do you want from me? I'm a bartender. It's past midnight, and, yeah, I'm kind of blowing smoke out my ass at this point. You want a doctor's opinion, talk to Dr. Phil. All right. All right. Easy, old man. Easy. Hey... this whole thing stays between us, right? Fuck you. What? You think I'm some kind of rat? Listen, I ain't never talked to the cops in my life, and I ain't gonna start now. I didn't do that back in Bensonhurst. I sure ain't gonna do it in L.A. What I'm saying is, your secret's safe with me. You shutting down shop yet? Come on, kid. Bring her over. You think they'll be okay? I honestly don't know. Hm. I just feel really bad for Carly, you know? Yeah, I hear you. -Hey... -Hmm? ...if we, um, start this, should I be worried? Oh. Come here. Don't worry. What about that maniac on the loose? -Sage? -Yeah. Nah. Don't worry about her. But, I mean... Besides, you could take her, easy. -Yes, I could. Yes, I could. -Yeah, you could. What if she comes back? What if the police find her and she gets a lawyer? What if she talks to her husband? Reid, what are we gonna do? Don't worry about it, Carly. We'll be fine. Where did we go wrong? I don't know. Were you happy when I proposed to you? I was happier at home. That's fair. What do we do now? Boy, I tell you. Of all the shit that happened during this crisis, I never thought the story I'd remember most would be about some squirrel-bait bitch hell-bent on trying to keep an affair alive. Well, if you're gonna put it that way, all I can say is, the things you go through during quarantine. Mm. -That was some shit, all right. -Mm. Shit happens. That it does. -Shit, it did happen. It does. -Yes. Yes, it does. Look, you're back in town, right? You ain't got no plans. You looking for work? Yeah, I am. I am. Come back in day after tomorrow. I could use a good right-hand man. I'll be here. Thanks. ♪ I can't live without you ♪ ♪ Time doesn't heal all pain ♪ ♪ The hurtin' never goes away ♪ -Cheers. -Cheers. To an unbelievable night.

As long as it's us. Like it should have been the whole time. But, instead, you know, I made us not us. Shh, shh, shh. Listen, mister. You're my knight in shining armor, and don't you ever forget it. -Okay, Katharine Hepburn. -You know you love it. Didn't know you were gonna recite -another cheesy movie quote. -You know you love it. -Come on. What about this here? -What? Oh, yeah. I think it's time. Time to bring them together.

Okay. I want you early tomorrow. I'm expecting a delivery. -Right? -I'll be here early. -Okay? Okay. -I'll be here for the delivery. I got this, all right? Don't worry.
