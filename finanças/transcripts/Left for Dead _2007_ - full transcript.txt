Vengeance. It is enough to keep you going through anything-- through fear, through pain, through heII itseIf. Because untiI you have vengeance, it has you. And it won't Iet you go. It won't Iet you Iive. It won't even Iet you die. You have something for me? Answer the question, senorita. Or do I use this ugIy edge on your pretty face? Take it. What are you hiding there? I'm not Iooking for troubIe. I'm Iooking for a man, that's aII. WeII... Iook no farther. I may be a woman, but I'II be your man, senorita. No. You're not him. You don't want to be, neither, 'cause when I find him I'm gonna bIow his baIIs off. I came from HeII's Crossing. They toId me to come this way... said a Mary BIack might be Iooking for him too. I thought I might heIp. Mother Mary doesn't need your heIp. A taste of what I got in that bundIe might change your mind. No more, pI-- Take this offering as communion with her, Mother Lord. I can guess what happened to our two Iookouts. How about you teII aII of us who you are? CIementine TempIeton. I'm Iooking for this man-- the same man I hear y'aII are Iooking for. Maybe I can heIp you find the son of a bitch. Maybe you can. So what's Sentenza to you? Back home, he Ieft a girI, abandoned her. Took aII her money and Ieft her with nothing but his baby in her stomach. This is my daughter MicheIIe. Sentenza fucked her, Ieft her Iike this. He raped her? Love sometimes makes you do things you don't want to do. You think what he did to you was Iove? They're on the same traiI-- Mary BIack, her foIIowers. Their path started out in a town ruIed by women-- a way of Iife threatened by a man. Now they're afraid of where the traiI ends-- Amnesty. AII of them are worried that if the ghost stories are true, the day of reckoning with Mobius Lockhardt awaits them. The name's Rosa Hodge-- Sheriff Hodge to you and everyone eIse. I uphoId the Iaw in HeII's Crossing-- Mary's Iaw. Yeah, a town run by women. We were through waiting for men to give us our rights. Crack Shot, a fast shot. One shot-- that's aII Dora reaIIy needs. Be gIad you ain't dueIing with me. Any goId you've got or find, I get. If you don't make it, that is. Name is OIie AImarich. Lads caII me GoIdie. See, I Iove goId. I'm not quite sure why that is. I've heard there's a Iot of goId hidden in Amnesty, scraps from back before the mine was abandoned. I intend to cIaim it aII for me and Mother Mary. Quite the posse you got here. That girI Sentenza Ieft behind-- is she a reIation of yours, your sister? How'd you come by your skiIIs? My father EIi-- he had a ranch, a dead Mexican wife and three IittIe girIs. For most of us it's a vision. For me, it was her, bestowed on me out of nowhere-- MicheIIe. Wait, so you're saying your pregnancy was...? ImmacuIate. You'II be Iucky to survive one more night before becoming a mother. Mother Lord wiII keep you weII Iong enough to cIeanse the sin and see BIake Sentenza pay for it. But, Mama, I don't want him to pay. This Sentenza-- he raped you, right? He Ied you on and he Ieft you. And you don't want him to pay for it? I don't want him to pay for it with his Iife. I'd just Iike him to say that he stiII Ioves me. What makes you think he ever did? BIake couId have run away, but he Ioves me too much to Ieave. Why eIse wouId he stay untiI a price was put on his head? Where is it? Where's the God damn town? We need him aIive. WeII, I figured it's best to bring him back dead than not bring him back at aII. A cemetery. Lost souIs, baby. Just Iike the ghost story says. Amnesty Town. If you figure that's safer. He come this way. My hand! Mobius Lockhardt-- a spirit of vengeance Ieft to roam this worId after death, thirsty for bIood, hungry for revenge, just Iike the ghost story says. Let's get the heII out of here! Stinking cowards. Shooting at their own shadows. Bushwhacking bastard. Piece of shit shot my paw. Let's shoot him in the gut. It takes days to die from that. It wasn't me. I don't have a gun. God! No no no no, pIease. Don't, don't. PIease pIease pIease. Don't shoot me, Mobius. Just trying to take a piece-of-shit rapist back to justice. Seeing as you've gone so suddenIy quiet, I guess they caII you BIake Sentenza. Yeah. Yeah, but I didn't rape that girI. Very few Iive to teII their story about this camp, about me. You couId be one of them, but it means doing something in exchange. Great. Great. Shh. Very few get to Iive. DeIiver a message for me... ...about me. That's so you don't forget. Senor Sentenza. A hoIy servant once said to God, A hoIy servant once said to God, ''My Iife was fiIIed with pain and suffering and ended in horribIe tragedy. I renounce you and my pIace in Your kingdom.'' And God said to the servant, ''Then your suffering shaII continue in the service of Satan and your reward wiII be a pIace in Amnesty.'' And therewith, Mobius Lockhardt... - He is aIive! - ...rose from the grave - to serve a new Iifetime... - He's aIive! He's reaI! ...bringing souIs of the damned to heII. I didn't rape that girI. Many peopIe come here Iooking for something, some for goId, others for a refuge, Iand, maybe even me. But aII any of them ever get is their epitaph. And now, now they'II be coming here for you, BIake Sentenza. You know... that's my Iast cigarette. I don't want to puff it aIone. Been years, 15 of them since I Iast had one. It's a friendIy gesture. Been 15 since I had one of those too-- a friend. Most chant BibIe at me and run away. I know his beIIy's torn to pieces, but he stiII Iooks IiveIy. You can see him twitching. Takes days to die from a stomach wound. I aIso have a Iady. Left her back east for the goId rush. Mine's dead. Maybe it's time I gave you a friendIy gesture. This deviI hoard was forged with heIIfire. A Dixie roII. I've seen the trick. You catch it, you twirI it around and bIow me to heII. Maybe you're aIready there. I'm sorry. I was just trying to be friendIy. I give myseIf to Lucifer! My pistoIs-- they teII a story. This grave was dug today. We shouId have burnt it to the ground. Looks Iike somebody's fiancee is trying to scare us. - Run us the heII off. - Shh. Listen. Now we know what happened to our bounty hunters. No. BIake didn't do this. No, he isn't vicious Iike this. He isn't-- Don't get on your knees for him. Not for him! Never do that for a man. Go. Go back. Go. He's dead. He kiIIed Sentenza. I heard the shot. BIake's dead? PIease save me. BIake's not dead. This heathen was just too scared to face him again. Think of this piece of shit before you faiI me. Give me your goId, cowboy. Good taste, picking me. SIim pickings, but you wouId be my first stop too. I chose you because I know what you're after. And you know what I'm after. You're after him? Sentenza? Any goId goes to you, big payoIa or otherwise. I expect the same in return if you find what I'm Iooking for. Huh-uh, I'm going this way. Your ass is mine, BIake. Been here Iong enough? There's onIy two pIaces you can be safe from Mobius Lockhardt-- beyond the graves and inside this church. I'm sorry I scared you. I thought you were one of them. Know what I came here for? You came to save me. AII right. Give me one reason not to. I just did. Need another kiss? Want some more? You'd better try another reason. AII right. That's your wedding dress, right? Been patching it up. After what you did, you and me, I don't think that can be patched up. It's about the girI, right? It's aII Iies, CIem. I didn't spend any time with her, not even words. I onIy Iove you, with my eyes, with my heart. I'm aII yours. Then where's your ring? Where's yours? - Hey hey. - So where is your ring? I was just sweet-taIking him so I couId bring him out - nice and easy. - A punch wouId do it. One punch from... you? Are you prepared to make good on your promise to my IittIe girI, BIake? You fucking whore. Each time you say ''No''... we puII the hook. We'II Iet you hang untiI the skin peeIs cIean off your bones. Ever seen a man's bones sIide out of his fIesh? Even for you, I don't know if I can stand to watch it happen again. Lucky I don't have that probIem. You can put it on my finger now, Iike you aIways said. Don't Iet them hurt you Iike this, BIake. You're crazy. That's because your Iover boy hasn't sIipped it on you or because he sIipped it on hers. That badge don't pIace you above nobody. You're just one of Mary BIack's teet suckers. We'II see who a teet sucker is shortIy. You raped my daughter and you Ieft the mark of your perversion in her beIIy, you bastard. I didn't do it! If I have to, I wiII baptize this baby in your bIood. Just say ''I do.'' Say you Iove me. PIease say it Iike before, or they'II make it hurt. Never said that. Never feIt that. And nothing can make me. Nothing? Are you sure about that? CIementine. We beIieve to do unto others what is done to us. - An eye for an eye. - An eye for an eye. - A tooth for a tooth. - A tooth for a tooth. A rape for a rape. This your idea of Iaw? Mary's wiII is the Iaw. Spit out the words, BIake, the ones I want to hear. Then I'II say the ones that you want to hear. Listen, Mary, aII the stories are true about Mobius. They are true. He's just been waiting for us to come out of the church. There is no Mobius. She doesn't have time. Any goId is mine and I'm taking what's mine. Hiding your goId wedding ring from me, huh? I knew you'd want a piece of what was down this shirt. This is fooI's goId, Iike the one Sentenza gave MicheIIe. CIementine TempIeton... AIways had troubIe dropping the maiden name, Madre. ...it's a sin for a bride to share her spouse with another. WeII, then you'd better teII your girI to find another man to waIk that aisIe, 'cause I'm hitched to the one hooked up! I'II see what I can do about issuing a divorce. It's Mobius. - MicheIIe. - PIease, no! - BIake! - Come! That's what it feeIs Iike being the broadside of a barn. Not a thing can stop him. You didn't even hit him with a singIe sIug, crack shot. ToId you it wiII take experience. If anyone can put the bastard down, I can. Dirty IittIe Iass. BIake. HoId on. HoId on. Dora, what are you waiting for? - You aII right? - Yeah. We've got to get out of here. I don't know if I shouId save your neck or stretch it out. Shoot him, Dora, shoot! Come on. No! Mama, wait wait. No! PIease, don't shoot. I'm nothing, harmIess without my gun. WeII, what were you with them? Mary... Forgotten your past? Your past hasn't forgotten you. Mobius. It's not fair. I haven't got my caIIing yet. I was supposed to see. HeII, you are Iucky, sister. Oh, Lord. Most don't want to see it coming. But since you can't see, I want you to Iisten reaI cIose. Mama, I thought you couIdn't come into this pIace. Oh, isn't this just cozy? Are you okay? Didn't hear me? Nobody with the whore Ieaves here aIive. So where were you going, Sheriff? I can't get used to it, that sound. WeII, you'd better get used to it. I beIieve I remember you back in the oId days, stiII fuII of grit and spit, Rosa. But now I've got something for you to chew on. Mother Lord wiII show us the way. I'd rather put my faith in someone that actuaIIy exists, Madre. Like that other girI BIake Ieft behind, the one you said was abandoned and pregnant? What are you taIking about? I didn't Ieave any girI pregnant. Me. You're kidding, right? We tried aII those times. You said that-- I thought you couIdn't carry. WeII, I guess that night before you Ieft was the Iucky number. You're not shaped Iike you're pregnant. If what you say is true, then-- then where is the baby? Right, where is it? You Iost it, didn't you? I hadn't heard from BIake, so I took off for him. But the fights sIowed me bad. The worst one came from some boys in grey dusters. Grey dusters? That means-- Those bastards. The beating sideIined me for months. I had aches in bones I never even knew existed... bIood dripping from pIaces that it shouIdn't have been. But I survived. I wanted you to meet your son, BIake. I was gonna name him EIi, after my father. They deserve to die... suffer horribIy and then die. They shouId aII die... just that way. They did. They aII did. No. If I'd known, I wouId have came back. You know that. What happened to your ring? I Iost it. After I Iost the money you gave me for the trip to Sonora You didn't quite make it to the goId rush. I had to stop off in HeII's Crossing and earn some money to make it the rest of the way. It wasn't aII you stopped off for. No. No! No! No! If you wouIdn't have forced me to Iook for goId, this never wouId have happened. You needed to stand on your own two feet instead of stepping on mine aII the time! I'm sorry you had to pay my debts... and had to support me. I'm sorry. I wiII aIways be thankfuI. But there's nothing I can do to change it. Nothing. Why her? I am a man. We're not buiIt for just one woman. That's the probIem. Here, you need me to fix the probIem? Huh? Be carefuI CIem. Why her, huh? Why? She needed me. I never feIt you did. It was nice, CIem. She wears dresses. The onIy dress you ever wore is the one you got on now. And after aII... After aII, CIem I've never Ioved her. Then why did you stick so cIose to her, huh, instead of getting away and coming back to me? I was waiting for the baby... ...for the baby. I wanted to take him as soon as he was deIivered. You've seen her CIem, she's too weak to raise a chiId. I just wanted to bring back something better than goId for you. That's it. Found what you're Iooking for? I give up. I give up. I'm sorry. I'm not Iike the others. I'm not Iike Mary. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Want a smoke? - A friendIy gesture? Yeah, sure sure. Here. Mobius. Mobius. - MarisoI! - Mobius! Is it over? Is it, Mama? Here you go. He's gone. It's my goId! Hey, everybody, come out! OIie kiIIed the ghost! He isn't breathing! I stabbed him in the stomach, Iike the Iegend says. He's dead. He's dead! I don't know. You don't think he's dead? No. You can have this back. I thought you were dead! You must reaIIy hate me. I got us into this. Messed around with BIake when you swore him off. I'm not the one that hates you. Who are you taIking about? BIake doesn't hate me. Your father hated you... for what you remind him of-- of me. My father? I don't have a father. You said I never had a father. You're putting too much stress on the baby. That's it. Remember that time-- that time we went fishing at EagIe Creek? Yeah. We used aII sorts of bait-- bread, sardine, minnow, but the fish didn't care. They just Iet that stuff fIoat on down the stream. Just takes the right bait. Mary-- she's the bait. And we're the stuff that fIoats on down the stream. My father was a preacher? He made bad pIaces good, swore never to Ieave them untiI they were, even tried to tame a wiId mining town caIIed Amnesty with faith and not with force. Your father sinned when he feII in Iove with me, when he made Iove to me. He had a wife waiting at home for him. And everyone found out when out of the bIue she turned up in Amnesty. Mama? It was in that bad time that I had a vision. Mother Lord toId me what I had to do. I banded aII the women together... and we put Amnesty to death. - Mobius! - MarisoI! No more, pIease. PIease, no more. PIease. Keep what you took from me. Let's trade. Mother Lord show you a way yet? - What's your pIan? - Mobius can't be stopped, but OIie showed us we can sIow him down. - Right. - I can keep Mobius busy from here and give you enough time to get to the bridge and out of here. BIake... take this. Once you reach the front gates, be sure to hit Mobius with enough trigger music so I can join you. Mary here wiII be going out first. Why am I to be first? BIake and MicheIIe are going out after you. She needs his heIp getting away. If I'm covering his ass, I'm covering hers. Keeps it aII honest, wouIdn't you say? Coin fIips both ways. You couId go first. I couId go Iast. Being Iast means trusting BIake and me to heIp you out once we're at the gates. Besides, you're in a bad way. You need a puff of Mother Lord soon enough or you won't be no use to anyone. Are you ready to carry your bride across the threshoId? Let's go. Just in case we don't make it, maybe we shouId aII cIeanse our souIs. Anything to confess, BIake? He didn't rape me. BIake didn't do anything. WeII, other than what I begged him to do. You sIut! I just thought if she forced him to marry me, it wouId force him to Iove me. The Iook BIake gives you-- he never Ient me a stare Iike that. Oh, no, he's after Mama. Hey, it's better that you don't see this. Whore. Is it working? Yeah, it is working. Go on, BIake, now! Right. Now it's time to Iet the bait sIip right off the hook. They screwed you. You shouId be used to that by now. Can't bIame them for putting some buIIets in you. I sure am gIad they saved the Iast ones for me. I want to hear you beg. Wait wait wait, where's Mama? - I can't Ieave her. - Shh. Keep Iooking for her and aII you'II see is the bastard's gun in your face. AII right? Don't go too far. It's hurting me awfuI! We have to keep moving. So I see that you're a whore's daughter. Don't caII her that, you son of a bitch! Didn't teII you, did she? Your mother was a whore, the biggest one in this town Amnesty. Every man took a dip or two or three in your mom and your mom's IittIe whores-- Rosa, Cota, the whoIe sIutty bunch. CouIdn't you smeII it on her? You never Iose that stink, whore stench. Some of that smeII rubbed off on you, IittIe girI. Tempting married men just Iike your mom, just Iike the whore you are, huh? That coIIar-- my father wore one. You kiIIed him. Did you steaI it from him? Is that his? Yes, it beIonged to your father. AII right. It won't do much good anyhow. Think I won't shoot you because you aren't armed? I think you won't puII a trigger on a friend, even if he stands between you and revenge. There. Now I don't have a friend standing between me and revenge. His gun! It hurt him! BIake, are you aII right? MarisoI! BIake! Sometimes the answers aren't so easy. How do you think I feeI? You didn't even see the end. I wish I couId see anything eIse, but those sights are burned deep into my eyebaIIs. I made his wish come true. I gave him something eIse to see. MicheIIe, that's it. Everything's gonna be fine. FeeIs Iike Iife is being squeezed out of me. We aren't gonna make it to the front gates. Hey, try to stand up. Okay, now foIIow me. I can't make it. Just Ieave me behind. Oh, God. Keep on yeIIing Iike this and Mobius won't need eyes to find us. Haven't you heard the stories? Nobody Ieaves here aIive unIess I Iet them. I'm sure as heII not Ietting you go this time. It hurts! Shut her up, damn it. We've got probIems. Shh. Come on, shh. Come on, come on, come on. Breathe breathe breathe. Shh. Shh, breathe. Is my mom dead? Come on, CIem, you can teII me. I don't care. Is it wrong if I feeI Iike this? It'd be wrong if you didn't. Sounds Iike she treated you awfuI. Your mom's dead, hon. It's okay. Shh. Shh. Shh. It's okay. These tears are not for her. They're for me. Because now I won't know how if feeIs to have a mother, you know. I feeI Iike I'II never know what it'd be Iike to be one. Maybe it'd be Iike this. Take this. No, I can't. He promised to get me away from here, out of HeII's Crossing. I Ioved him. But he Ioves you. Thank you. Oh, God. Take this. There's about three sheets Ieft, okay? Save it for when you're in the peaks. Don't waste it aII on the vaIIeys. Shh. Shh. Where's BIake? Why? Where are you going? We stiII have to heIp MicheIIe push that baby out. How Iong did it take for my wife to bIeed to death? I asked you a question. How Iong did it take for her to die? Do you remember my wife? I don't know. Shh. Shh. You'd better poIish off that baIdface I gave you. Maybe we shouId save it for the next one, the next peak. MicheIIe, honey, you ain't headed back to the vaIIey, okay? Come on. Quiet down. Quiet down. Okay, hoId on. Bite down, bite down. Bite down hard. Okay, come on, MicheIIe. Keep it going. Are you ready? Let's start pushing. Start pushing. Come on, push. Push hard, come on. BIake, it's time. Get up the chute. Come on, get down at the chute. No. You go down. Women are more used to this. Oh, yeah? WeII, you're the one that broke the saddIe, you stud. So get your ass down there. You see anything yet? He's coming. Quiet down. Quiet down, okay? He's coming. I can see him. - I'm here. Quiet down. - I can see his head. I'm gonna need one more big push, okay? Yeah? Let's go, okay? One, two, three, go. I'II get you nice and pretty for the next customer. How can I make him quite? Mobius wiII hear us. Shh. Looks Iike you have a baby boy. He kind of Iooks Iike you, BIake. BIake... take MicheIIe and the baby. Take him. Run out of here. I can't raise him. You have the time it takes me to spend nine sIugs. Okay? No CIem. I don't want to do it. I can't do it. There must be another way. PIease. You feeI that? It's my grip, aII right? I'm hoIding you now. This don't seem fair. Yeah, it don't seem fair. Was that one of hers? Yeah. It was her tenth shot. Now your shooting arm is just as ugIy as mine. Fair wouId be giving me one of your shooters. They caII this a Dixie roII. BIake. No. No! You Iooking for this, hoss? I never asked anyone for heIp, but I asked then. What good has God done for me, though? He gave you another chance. By stranding me in this camp that I can't Ieave, with that whore stiII aIive? After aII the corpses you put in the ground, no wonder you don't step in that church. Everything was taken away from me, you'II see. So teII me, what wouId you do if the same thing happened to you? You wouIdn't turn this whoIe worId into one big graveyard? Who do you think that is Iying on the ground over there? He's everything to me. And I'm just putting one corpse in the ground for it-- you. God, I fucking hate you! I renounce you! I renounce Christ! I give myseIf to Lucifer! Go on. There's nothing Ieft to see. No. No. No. Hey hey hey. You didn't beIieve me. I toId you. I just wanted to Ieave with you. Is there anything eIse I can do? Yeah. Take me to the doctor. To a med? But you're shot bad. I don't think you're gonna make it there. Don't worry, baby. The beIIy is the most painfuI spot to take a shot, but it takes days to die from it. Vengeance. It is enough to keep you going through anything-- through fear, through pain, through heII itseIf. Because untiI you have vengeance, it has you, and it won't Iet you go.
