Remember? The Dragon Wagon. You were gonna teach me how to drive. And there was that one tree... ...banged into the car while we were inside... That's right. - You actually lied for me. - I lied for me. No, come on. You lied for both of us. You actually did something decent for me. That's a part of history you can't change. - That was a stop sign. - You're kidding, right? In your car, I'd be kidding. On this road? I haven't seen a car in 50 miles.

There's usually a reason when you like the long way home. Gee, like, maybe I like the country? - OK. - Just drive, brat. I'm only thinking the same thing Mom and Dad are gonna be thinking. "Trisha, why are you driving home for spring break with your brat brother and not heading off somewhere with that nice 'Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team Guy'?" I will tell them the same thing I'll tell you: None of your goddamn business. What? You don't think I could understand the complex nature of your relationships? No, I look at you as a real expert. Huh, whatever. I don't- I don't care. I'm just saying, if you broke it off with him, you should at least figure out what you're gonna tell Mom and Dad. - They're the ones in love with the guy. - What would Jesus do...

It's the same highway. This highway runs the length of the state. You believe it? That they had to go looking for her head? That they never found them, they only found the car. No, they never found her head. They found the car. - Didn't find him or her head. - Look at me, I'm still shaking! You don't think every generation has their cautionary tale of drinking and driving on prom night? I don't know. I always heard it was true.

[ Continuing into gibberish ] Nah-ha, infinity. Uh-huh, infinity squared. [ Birds chirping ] - OK, name it. - What? When we made the rule that you had to call it as soon as you see it. - Would you give it up already? - No. That's 'cause the rule has always been the first person who calls it, gets it. - You talk to Mom lately? - To tell her I'd be home for break. She sound weird? - What? - Did you listen to her voice? - Could you specify, please? - Forget it. Did you drink the last water? The last one was mine. Damn it. Oh, you are a class act, you know that? You live off-campus. You ever try and do laundry in a dorm? What they don't steal, they dye pink. I've got 12 pairs of rosy-pink Jockey shorts. Maybe they know something about you you don't. "Hi, Mom. Haven't seen you in forever. Here's my dirty shorts." Nice. It's for her, not me. What? I have to bring home laundry. If I don't, she gets depressed. She thinks I don't need her anymore or something. I'm serious. - Goof. - Bitch. - Mama's boy. - Daddy's whore. - Dick licker. - Ball sniffer. - Ass kisser. - Butt picker. Repeat. "Ass" and "butt."

We were just attacked, Darry! And you don't even wanna find out why? We look in the pipe, that's it. Is this your idea of a little adventure or something? 'Cause this is why girls are smarter, OK? We look in the pipe, if there's nothing there, nothing we can do, we just drive on home and call the cops. You know that's what we should do. - Bullshit, I do. - Bullshit, you don't! Look me in the eye and tell me you can just drive away. Just drive off, leave whosever back there, back there. Maybe find out later they'd still be alive if you'd just gone back. Don't make this about the right thing to do. You just wanna go back there and see if there's something nasty at the end of that pipe. OK. And what if it was you back there?

Up top? Anybody on ground level? We have an 11-99. - I repeat, an 11-99. - This is Tubbs, go ahead. We got a situation down here, Sarge. It's headed towards you, up the rear stairs. You copy? - Coming up the rear stairwell. - Stay here. [alarm ringing ] I'm gonna get you out of here. Come on, I said! [ Police clamoring ] Let's go! Somebody down there talk to me. We have one inmate and one officer down. Ramirez, he's hurt bad. The son of a bitch tried to take a bite out of him. He what? [ Gunshots ] This guy is wearing something, Sarge. 'Cause I'm a son of a bitch, but we cannot take him down. What the hell do you mean, "wearing something"? You'd think I was crazy if I told you what this looked like. This is about the weirdest fucking body armor you've ever seen. [ gunshots ] Where... Where is he? - Talk. - He's gone. He's gone, Sarge. This guy just climbed up the fucking wall. You are not making one goddamn bit of sense. You can put me in a straightjacket, but this fucker is gone. Gone? What the hell you talking about, gone? This guy's a real mover and a shaker, Sarge. We just lost him on the stairwell. I can't see! I can't see! He's heading right up to you. Copy? What is it? [yelling ] [ groaning ] [ Gun, flashlight clanging ] [thud 1 Move, move, move, move! Stay tight! [ Slithering sound ] [ Slithering sound ] [ gunshots ] [ Gunshots continue in distance ] Shit. This is your way out? These must lock automatically if the power's out. - You didn't know that? - I don't dream everything! This isn't everything! This is our way out! It's not like watching a movie, honey. There are parts missing sometimes. We have to get out of here now. There's no other way except the front... [ banging ] Well, the front door is out. Why don't you dream up something useful? I thought if you knew what I saw, maybe you could change it. Why the hell do you think I'm here? You know. Don't you? You knew when you walked in. You know who it wants. - You know what it wants. - I've dreamed this. You know what's gonna happen. You will run up the stairs and hide, but I don't know what happens to me. "Jeepers Creepers." "Jeepers Creepers," right? Who? Who hears "Jeepers Creepers" while screaming in the dark? Huh? Huh? Are they ever wrong? I don't believe you. - You don't understand. - Your dreams, are they ever wrong? - You go to hell. - I said, "You don't understand." Are they ever wrong? Are your dreams ever wrong? She doesn't know. She doesn't know shit. [ Shouting ] Get upstairs! NOW! Our Father, who art in heaven hallowed be Thy... Huh? [ Growling ] [ Growling ] [ sniffing ] [ Glass shattering ] [ Sniffing ] [ Sniffing ] [ Glass shattering ] [ Roaring ] [ screeching ] What in the holy name of God? Oh, God... Take me. You don't want him. You don't want him. Whatever you want, you can take it from me. You don't want Dan-y. No, you don't. Don't you... Don't you be a hero! I have everything the same inside. You take me! - It's OK. - You hear me? You take me. You fucking let him go! [ Roaring ] [ Guns cocking ] Please. Please, let him go. - Trish, please don't do this. - Just think for a second. I won't fight you. You can take me. I'm stronger. You want me. Drop him. Let him go and take me. You let him go! [ glass shattering ] Dan-y! Dan-y! Dan-y! Dan-y! Your folks just pulled up outside. You never answered him. Are your dreams ever wrong? Darry screaming in the dark while that song is playing. What did that mean? What did you really see? I'm just a crazy old woman. You ask anyone around here, they'll tell you. That's all I am. Just a crazy old woman with... crazy dreams.
