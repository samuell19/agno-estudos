It seemed that everything and everyone he loved, he lost and so he his heart behind a big fleshy body, so it could never be broken again. But just because he was done loving didn't mean he was done fighting. He teamed up with the Guardians of the Galaxy and set off on some classic Thor adventures he got in shape, putting in the hard yards, turning pains into games and never skipping leg day. He went from dead body to God, one beneath his God, but there was still a sad but just trying to get out.
