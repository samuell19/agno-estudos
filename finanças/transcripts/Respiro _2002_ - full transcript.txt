You leave me alone as well. Mam What the hell is this? Shut up and eat. What are you staring at? I can't stare? What's that getup? Where are you going? To Paris. Bullshit! She's off to Via Roma. We're going there, too. Isn't that Alessandra? - Shall we go? - Come on. Alessandra? Teresa? Did you cut your hair? It suits you. Coming for a walk? My? News; Can you draw gulls? - Do one for me? - Where? Here, on my chest. - You want a big one? - Yes, big. - And me! - I want a gull, too! I want a nice white one. Do me a cool tattoo. Look. The gull's all bald. Shut up. Get out of here. - We're bored shitless here. - Shut it. Let's go someplace, me and you. You're beautiful. - Want to kiss me? - No. Kiss you? You never wash. She'll never kiss you. Alessandra! Teresa! We're coming. You're leaving? Giovanna! Wash them properly! Morning, everyone. - What do you want? - Are you done? No. What's in the bag? Food for the dogs up at the fort. Coming to the beach with me? - Can I take him? - Sure. Just this once. But we have work tonight. Want to go to the beach? You go. I don't want to see them. Filippo, stay here. - Brought me some wine? - No. - Got a cigarette? - No. She's staying there? She's fine where she is. Ewan-n What are you doing? Catch! Mom, come back! Come back, I said! - Put this on at least! - Come out right now! Come on, come back! Out! Quick! Get out right now! There's no one around. Come on, sweetheart. Let's float. Stop it! Float. Let's go. Get my bra. Where are the dogs? Here! Catch! - What do you want? - A ball. - How many fish? - Three. Three fish, that's not enough. You can pick a ticket. What's the prize? An electric train.

Why can't I go on the boat with the others? Sta-Lia'.! Look. What are you trying to do? Cut it out. Did you catch anything? - Why? - Pasquale, come on! Help me! What? There's nothing to see! Wait. - Pasquale, come here! - Wait. I want to come... Drink up. What's the matter? Wait. Everything's okay. The wine, Filippo. What's for after? The pasta's good. Good evening! Come on, we need to talk. Look what Pasquale did to Vito's eye. He did that? - Ten against three. - Ten against three? This can't go on! You have to do something! Look, he almost lost an eye! - I'm sorry. - No, I'm the one who's sorry! - Calm down. - You calm down! MM mm Come here, you. Ten against three! Go on, get revenge. - You punish him. - Me? - Yes, you have to punish your son. - No problem. It's not difficult. You do it. Enough, Vito. You want to hit him, too? - That's enough. - Are you sure? We're quits now. - Let's have a coffee. - Forget it. - You're offending me. - I don't want the coffee. What a bastard, telling him... Grazia, where's that coffee? Marinella! Get her shot! Calm down. I'm sorry. Hold her. Go outside, kids. Get out. Filippo, go on. Filippo, go. Filippo, get out. I'm here. It's all over now. Antonietta. What is it? That institute in Milan where your brother-in-law works, what's it called? They're specialists... Is it for Grazia? What's wrong? You know... either she is too happy, or she is too sad. We don't know how to help her. She is aggressive or affectionate for no reason. She drives us mad. - She's always been that way. - It's getting worse. What do you say? Nothing. What do you expect me to say? - Can I go now? - Yes, go home. You're so good-looking. Sure. You're so strong. What'll you do with those arms? I'll build you a house by the sea. Pasquale, take the dog out. The door! Is it a present? Do you like it? Hello, signorina. Your identity papers, please. They're at home. You're driving with two passengers... and on top of that, you don't have your papers? Are you new here? I started yesterday. Welcome. Thank you. This time, I'll turn a blind eye. But one of you has to get off. How will I look otherwise? Get off, Filippo. Why me? Vim Sm We told you to get off. Sorry. -It's okay. - Thanks. Okay, you can go. You're off to Milan? You're talking to me? Yes, you. You're off on a trip, you lucky girl. Me? Who told you that? - Antonietta, the pharmacist. - Yes, she told me, too. I'm staying put. You're seeing her brother-in-law at the Institute. Drop it. She told you she's not going. I wouldn't mind someone taking care of me, either. What are you talking about, blockhead? Blockhead? Me? Me, a blockhead? You think you're a star or what? Drop it, bitch! Coming into town with us? I stink. I need a shower first. Let's go. - Stop! - No, I stink too much. Start the siren! Start it, okay? Calm down. That's enough now! Go slowly! They're behind us! Run! Watch the girl. I saw her. Calm down. Move it. What the hell? I'm washing everything. Come on. Wait for me here. Anyone home? Come in. I'll come back. Can I help you? Here you are. Good evening. Why did you run off? I can't tell you why. What's wrong? Everything's okay? Can I help you, sir? How about a coffee? Don't put yourself out. Thank you. Excuse me. Goodbye. Almost ready. Tonight, we'll have pasta with sea urchin sauce. Cefalo! Bastards! Pasquale! Here's the oil. We'll soon have them out. You'll see. - Rub it on. - Gently. We add potatoes? Yes, potatoes. And cucumber. Perfect. That will clear it up. A miracle cure. I feel a bit sleepy. Me, too. Sleep? The hell they will. Mind your own business. Don't move. Okay, you wimps? Got a cigarette? And a light? Thanks. You're welcome. Well? He gave me a smoke. - Is that all? - Yes. Get up, Filippo. Come on. Where are we going? Calamari... red mullet... sardine... octopus... bream... scorpion fish... bream. Here comes the fish! Look! They're all mine, all these fish. Signora, I want to bet them all!

It's beautiful. You're going to break it. Let me. Just a second. Let him play. I'm putting it together so he can play. If you want to see the train, wait outside! Get out. I'll call you one at a time. Look. It's beautiful. Leave me the rails. Out of the way! The curves... Wait. Let me see. It's beautiful. Mi mi - No, it's mine. - And mine. - Why? - Because. Come on, the train's ready. - Is it carnival time or what? - Yes, it is. Look at this. Get rid of it. Want some makeup, too? You'd look cute with a bit of rouge. Leave my son alone. Go and get washed, too. A zabbaro! What the hell are you doing? Move your asses! Get as much as possible! Marinella! With that cop again! Let's go! Beautiful, huh? Who's this? My brother. What're you doing? - Don't look at me like that. - Get lost. - Why? - I want to be alone. You can't stay here. No, leave me be. You're coming home with me, now. - She doesn't want to. - What's up with you? Who do you think you are? Who the hell are you? She's my sister! You want trouble? I don't understand your accent. What did he say? Cut it out. - Filippo! Take her away! - If I come down, you're dead. What does the cop want? Are you still here? Let's split. No, get out of here. You're coming immediately with me. Right now! You realize what you're doing? Do I realize? Get home, I told you. - Leave her. - What's up with you ? You want trouble? I'll slaughter you. Out of the way! Get home, I told you! Are you happy now? Shut up or else... Out of the way. You joker. Think you're Rambo? Why don't you go? They're waiting. Go. No one's waiting for me. Get lost... What are you mumbling? We had to fish deep. - Deep? - Yes, but... There's nothing left to catch. - The trawlers aren't pleased. - You said it. They're destroying the seabed. The children won with those four fish... They're playing with their train. What? Coming with me? Can't you see I'm talking? - Maybe near the lighthouse... - No, not evenm. Cheers. Let's drink. What do you want? Well? We're going out again tonight. You have nothing to do? Hold this for me. Do me a favor. Let me have a drink alone with my friends. Here, forget about it. So, fishing... What was I saying? The fish you gave the children. Filippo won a train. Come on, faster! Pasquale. Come on. The dog's on the bed again. Take her. Put her out. You're not going to bed? I want to tie her up first. There's no need. I'll wait outside. - Tie her up. - What for? There're too many sick dogs around! What're you going to do? She won't stop growling. She'll end up biting someone. Tie her up, I told you! Let's go! Pastora. Hello. You're leaving? We're going for a ride. - With the sails? - Yes, with the sails! Where are you from? France. - Paris? - No, not Paris. Can I come? Be our guest. Will we be back late? In a few hours. He's GÃ©rard. I'm Olivier. Grazia, delighted. - Where're you going? - For a sail. - Are you looking for trouble? - Get off! - Come along, too! - Don't do it! - You come, too! - What? Us, too? Where're you going? For a sail. No, Mom, you can't stay here. What's your problem? Come on. We're going. Let's go. What the hell's going on? Get off there! Get off! Move it! Come on! Get off the damn boat! Pietro! - Get off that boat! - All right. Let go of me! I'm getting off. Right now. I'll bleed him. Where the hell did you come from ? The way the talks! You killed my dog! I'll smash your face in! Cuckold! Where's my wife? Where is she? What are you doing? Get out. Come on, you're free. Off you go! Look at them run. She's a public menace. She should be chained. It's high time she left for Milan. We can't have a woman like her around here. She's nothing but a troublemaker. She's a raving lunatic. What do you expect? She's a mess. And she takes it out on us. Grazia, come out here. We need to talk. - About what? - Sit down. If you don't tell her, I will. There's a doctor in Milan who can help you. We've already called him. Help me do what? We can't go on living like this. You have to go. Be reasonable. I'm not moving from here. You're going to Milan, and that's final! - I'll kill myself. - Calm down. Don't tell me to calm down! You're the one who should leave ! Get out of my house ! Marinella, her shot! - Get out! - Her shot! - Give her the shot! - I'll see to it. Just go away! It's always the same. Mom, will you please get out? Sleep with me. Where's your mother? Go and find her. Where are you going? Pasquale, go away. - Don't tell anyone you saw me. - Where are you going? I won't go to Milan. I know a place where you can hide. - Where? - Come with me. Come on. Sit down. - Whose stuff is this? -It's mine. - You can drink the water. - Really? Nice and cool. What do you do when you come here? Nothing much. I mend fishing rods... I make catapults... I sit in the shade. Lie down. You have to stay calm. Don't think of anyone else. You're going to do what I say. Here's Pasquale. - Well? - No sign of her. What are you doing in here? Shall we throw those old gossips out? I can't stand them anymore. FEM WW Because I told you to. Did you find her? Where did you look? At the Point and the Sun Tree. Keep looking, we'll check over there. Everyone's looking for you. You'll never make it. I will. You'll see. - Swear it. - I swear. On my head. What's wrong? Put this on. Mm my; ma; Thank you. You're leaving? I'll be back tomorrow. Want to eat? Some fish? - Give me a kiss. - You swore. Eat, Filippo. Where's Mom? - Eat, it'll get cold. - Where is she? - In Milan. - When will she be back? Tomorrow. Eat. Go home! Still here? It's like talking to a brick wall. - I don't believe it. - Shut up and eat. We'll help you find her. - Thanks. - Come on, lads, let's go. Come on, Pino. Dad, where are you going? There are caves here. I'll check. Sta-Lia'.! They've found her! Pasquale, go home now. What's wrong? Is everything okay? It's okay. Are you all right? What have you brought me? Fish. It stinks! What's happening at home? Mg FEW'? They're fine. No one's asked about me? Have you rested? I need to wash. Go down to the sea. What do you want to eat tonight? Chicken. I have to go. Drink, Pietro. - Drink! - I'll drink. Go on home now. Go on. What's wrong with him? He won't wake! Let's take him home. Dad's here. Come on. Slowly! Stand aside! Help me, Pino. What did he say? He's talking to the chicken. He's calling the chicken. He won't wake up. What did he say? He's speaking about a chicken. A chicken? Come here! Out of the way. Are you scared of chickens or what? There, what do you want to do? Here you go. I got your chicken for you. Are you okay? I can't stand this anymore. Where's your dad? Has he forgotten me? He's stopped looking? He's stopped looking. He thinks you're dead. Me? Dead? Everyone's mourning. You're a saint now. What are you saying? A saint. What the hell are you saying? Speak! You can't just lie there. Let's go hunting. Want to go rabbit hunting? Tonight is San Bartolo's feast! Down here. - Get the rope ready. - Let Pino go. - No, I'm going down. - Let me do it. No, you'll go after. You asked me to come along, so I'm going. Slack. Slack. Give it a pull. Let me down. Slack. Give me some slack! Why did you bring me up? I want to go back down. I have to go further down. Grazia's there. (Bra-Lia? It's Grazia. Lower me down. Grazia? What are you talking about? I saw my wife! She's down there! Let go of me! We have to go down to her! Let go of me! Pietro!
