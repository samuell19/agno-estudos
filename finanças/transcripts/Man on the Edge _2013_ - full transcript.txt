They soak the red beans all they long And they boil the beans strong for 40 minutes Medium for 90 minutes, then gently 30 minutes Do you know the pain they go through standing by the heat for 3 hours just to get a handful of filling? How should I know? And the dough! How do you ignore that? That's another really tough job Sure, you can buy Pillsbury instant dough mix from supermarket That will give you exactly 750 rice cakes But someone out there is mixing medium and weak flour by exactly 4 to 1 ratio Mix it with eggs and margarine and stir it right on 45 agrees angle Stir it until their arms fall out Do you know that pain?
