Matt helm is dead, and he's going to stay dead. Well, now just a darn minute. That's direct from the white house, Matt. Well, I ain't votin' for him again. [Sighing] It's up to you. Shall we, uh, look at some pictures? Hey, your own drive-in movie. Huh? There's a car just like this waitin' for you. Where? We'll get to it. Hey, double feature. That's the French riviera, Matt. Cannes, to be exact. You're exact. [Matt] Hey, valley of the giants. [MacDonald] That device they tried to kill you with was developed by our own scientists, Matt. It's called a helio-beam. That's the man that invented it. [Matt] But when did he find time? His name is Dr. Norman solaris. He's, uh, been vacationing on the riviera. How did you tear him away from the lab? He's been working on this invention for years. And now he has a super-helio-beam. I figured he had somethin'. This beam can knock out an army, Matt, a city, a continent! It can bring peace or complete annihilation. It's a dreadful responsibility. I can see it's, uh, weighing heavily on his mind. 2 days before he was supposed to meet with the president, solaris suddenly disappeared. Defected, kidnapped, we don't know. Maybe he was just worn out. Just vanished without a trace. Have you looked under any beds? Mmm-hmm. Matt, whoever has solaris is trying to build that beam. We haven't got much time. Any leads at all? Mmm-mmm. This is a rare type ore, Matt. It's called helio-magnesium-x4. I liked the other measurements better. This x4 is essential to the operation of the super-beam. There's a huge load of it on its way now across the mediterranean. You find out its destination, and we believe you'll find solaris. You'll be operating out of monte Carlo. Mighty pretty country down around there. Her name is Dominique. You'll be, uh, working very closely with her. As close as I can get. Oh, and by the way, your name will be James a. Peters. [Clicking] Ah! Matt, now I'm going to throw you a curve. And it's a big one. If you find solaris, we want you to get him out if you can, naturally. But if you can't, you... You're gonna have to kill him. We can't risk what he knows getting over to the enemy. Why do I always get the fun jobs? Because you're the only one I can trust. Matt, for the first time, there's been a break in the security in I.C.E. There's a traitor among US. A double agent. That's why only 2 people know you're still alive. Me and the president. And that's why you'll be operating strictly on your own. You can't even contact me. You understand? Right. Oh, and, Matt, uh, one other thing. What I, uh, what I just said to you about solaris applies to you as well. I don't get you. Matt, they can brainwash a vacuum cleaner. They'd have you killin' for them, you wouldn't even know you were doing it. So if they grab you, you get in a jam, you can't get out... I understand. Good boy. I ain't goin'.

Contact Dominique immediately. Hotel du gide, Avenue St. germain. Ah, shut up! I'll fix you, boy. I-I'll join the a.A., and you won't have anybody to talk to. You say one word and I'll kill you. Ah!

All right, get out of here. Oh, now I know why you took me off the hook with the police. You thought I knew something about this fellow, solaris. That's right. [Matt] What's he to you? What's the difference? Look, coco had something to do with this. She's a bad guy, and she's capable of anything. And what are you? You think I'm a murderer, you lie to the police on a chance that you'd find your boyfriend-- he is not my boyfriend! [Sighs] Norman solaris is my father. He's never wanted it known. Vanity, I guess. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I don't know anything about it. Now you figure it out for yourself. If this coco girl hired me to do the job, she wouldn't have shown up at the police station. And I ain't no murderer. Now, what makes you so positive she is? Jealousy, revenge. My father and Dominique were pretty good friends for a while. Then coco came along. Coco wanted him for coco. She really fell for him? He was here on vacation. Vacations end. Coco didn't want it to. Look, maybe I'm all wrong. He can take care of himself. Only this time... I don't know. I've got the funniest feeling that she's mixed up in it somehow. Well, I figure that if anybody's the heavy, it's her husband, that monsieur wall. They're not married. You mean they hate each other like that for nothin'? She and Julian wall have been together for years. She flaunts her little side trips in front of him. I think it's part of the arrangement. Nice people. [Chuckles] Rich people. That island out there, he owns it. Shipyards, boats, yachts. Barges? A whole fleet of them. I think I'll come over to your side.

No offense. Well, what are you doing here? To tell you the truth, i--i was having a barbecue. I ran out of charcoal. I am going to keep doing that every time I hear an answer I don't like. Shall we try again? What are you doing here? Oh, I heard, uh, rumors around the waterfront and I figured if I got somethin' on you, it might be worth money to somebody. What rumors? Oh, about some kind of ore. Now that was a good answer. I liked that one. Hey, I'm glad. [Clanging] Now can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't drop you to the pavement? Certainly: I'll get killed. Besides, I can, uh, tell you where I get all my leads. Where? Oh, not while I'm up in this shovel, mister. What were you doing in Dominique avignon's apartment? Oh, a fellow in the states, he gave me her number. 39-26-34. The girl from the discotheque, we know you were in her flat last night, too. We will have to do something about her. Oh, I tried. Nothing.

You look stunning. Thank you. I believe just a dash of red. Yes? Watch the dress. Well, Dr. Solaris, in a little while, Washington traffic will be at its height. Operation scorch will kill a great many people. We call it operation scorch. Catchy title. It's up to you, doctor. My colleagues are waiting. Where do we begin? Oh, hey. Hold... You talked me into it. You--you get MacDonald on one of those things and I'll talk to him. We'll play a little game, "what's my line?" May I? I deal in services and I'm bigger than a breadbox. Now, who am I? He's Matt helm. Huh? We got a winner. You are dead. I'm beginning to believe it. Look, I'll tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. You call off the heat, I'll call off the I.C.E. I'll tell MacDonald you were wiped out. They'll go on home. That'll give you more time, give me more time. Crazy? Traitor. No doubt about it. I like it. A call just came in on our special frequency. Get it back. And monitor the call. If they try to trace US, jam 'em. Would you fill this up? I always like to take a little straight bourbon before I talk to Mac, 'cause he wouldn't recognize me if I was sober. [Man] We're ready with the call, sir. One wrong word, wrong inflection... Thank you. Mac, it's Matt. I got news. Matt, are you all right? [Matt] Oh, couldn't be better. As a matter of fact, I'm standing here having a nice little glass of bourbon. [MacDonald] What's news about that? Oh, celebrating. I just thought you'd like to know that, uh... Well, mission accomplished. Solaris alive, and, uh, happy ending u.S.A. Great, Matt. Great. Fill me in. How was it? Pretty rough? Well, you know, it was warm for a while. What's a little heat among friends? I'll tell you all about it. Ok, Matt. Good boy. You wind up things at your end, and I'll meet you at the new headquarters. I'll see you back in Washington. Right, bye. [All] Congratulations. Save it. Save it. Matt helm never took a drink of bourbon in his life. And the new headquarters are at Baltimore, not Washington. He must have said Washington because that must be the hit. Give the order to evacuate Washington. Now. Hold it. Hold everything, just a second. One other thing. Matt also said: "What's a little heat among friends?" Mmm? Heat, heat among friends. [MacDonald] Padgett, Levinson. Butler, furnas, whitmo-- furnas! [Glass shattering] [Beeping] Well done, Mr. Helm. There may be a place in our organization for you after all. [Man] Mr. Wall, Mr. Wall. Urgent. Yes. I monitored the call as you ordered. Something came in after you finished. From furnas. Well? I could barely hear him. He said: "Matt helm's call was a trick. "Some kind of code. MacDonald knows." He also said: "We won't be hearing from him anymore." [Thudding] Take him. MacDonald knows, does he? Well, he's too late. Dr. Solaris, are you going to tell US how to operate your invention, or would you rather see your daughter tortured to death? The next one will be closer. [Machinery whirring] No, it doesn't go with the outfit. What a way to finish. For a guy that drank booze all his life to end up like a milkshake. [Screams] [Gasps] [Julian] Stay. I have one spear left, doctor. Don't tell him. Don't look and don't tell him. Wait. [Machinery whirring] [Electronic buzzing] It's all set. Let her go. She will be our guest for a while. Take her to the guest quarters. I'm waiting. [Buzzing increases] The beams are on their way. [Machinery whirring] Oh, wait a minute. I wanna watch this. I want to see him get what's coming to him. Well, I don't know. We better-- please. He tried to kill my father. Ok. It's remarkable equipment. Dr. Rogas invented it. I'm his nephew. Oh! Please. When the selenium rectifier retracts, the oscillation increases. You don't say. It breaks down the rheostatic vibro-voltage to a minimal .360 on the oscilloscope. Cute. Magnesium transformer. Multivator circuit, inverted radium shield. All absolutely impregnable against dust, heat, cold, rust, erosion. Bulletproof, too. Wow. [Banging] [Electronic squeaking] [Explosion] [Explosions sounding] Attention all power units, this is Dr. Rogas. There has been a failure in the multivator circuit. Man your respective stations for an immediate check of the entire v.T.V.M. System. The selenium rectifier, the c.R.T., the multivator frequency, the energized oscilloscope. I repeat. The selenium rectifier. You, you. Cover the door. I'll finish the job myself. [Gun clicks] [Gun fires] Hey. Knock it off. That's what I say, Charley, knock it off. [Both grunting] [Grunts] Uh, maybe it's this one? Or this-- no, don't touch that. That's the magnet. What? The magnet. Oh. Well, I was only trying to help. But don't touch that. Matt! Behind you. [Metal dinging] [Explosion] [Gun fires] [Machine gun firing] The boat! I'll get the boat! [Gun fires] [Machine gun firing] [Machine gun fires] [Gun clicking] And now if you'll excuse me, doctor. No. You are right. [Gun firing] I give up. I can't go on. 7, 8, 9... [Clicking] Where's wall? It's no use. He's controlling the beam from the hovercraft, out there. [Engine whirring] They're right behind US, sir. [Explosion] Well, shoot back. With what? Oh, good shot. [Explosions sounding] If he aims like that at Washington, he'll hit Pittsburgh. [Explosion sounding] He's yawing! I don't feel so good myself. Mr. Matt helm. Our operation scorch is on its way. No, nothing can stop it now. Go ahead and shoot. I have failed, just shoot. If you say so. [Clicks] [Clicks] [Gun firing] Clever. If you say so. Excuse me. Who's ahead? The game is over. [Glass tinkling] There they are. Naturally. I majored in navigation while I was at Yale. It's Billy! A boat and a helicopter. I'm sending all my kids to Yale. Polka dot shorts! The only way to fly. Oh, that was a marvelous welcome home party. Yeah, and the party hasn't even started. Oh, yeah? I like being back in america. I love it. I love every nook and cranny. Every hill and Dale. Easy, I get a little ticklish west of the Mississippi.
