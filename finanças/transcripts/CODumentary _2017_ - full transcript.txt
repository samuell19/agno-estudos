UTAH BEACH, NORMANDY, FRANCE In the early hours of June 6th 1944 allied paratroopers were dropped behind enemy lines close to the beaches in Normandy, France. It would mark the beginning of D-day and was a major turning point in world war II. Nearly 60 years later many of the battles and events which took place that day would be digitally recreated to form a historic backdrop of one of the world's biggest video games. IN 2002 ELECTRONIC ARTS RELEASED THE AWARD-WINNING GAME MEDAL OF HONOR ALLIED ASSAULT IN 2002 ELECTRONIC ARTS RELEASED THE AWARD WINNING VIDEO GAME MEDAL OF HONOR ALLIED ASSAULT DEVELOPED BY 2015 GAMES MANY OF THE TEAM INCLUDING VINCE ZAMPELLA, JASON WEST, TODD ALDERMAN & CHANCE GLASCO LEFT THE COMPANY TO START A NEW STUDIO INFINITY WARD Tulsa is a very Midwestern city. It's about half a million people, very friendly atmosphere. We were the only game company, you know, in Tulsa. After we had started Infinity Ward we had made Medal of Honor Allied Assault and we put, you know, a little over two years into that and we had to start over from scratch. During my time at Amblin while the guys were working at Tulsa I'd spent most of my time focused on supporting the feature film and animation divisions. Medal of Honor was one of the flagship titles for Dreamworks Interactive and it was pivotal in getting the whole division up and running. When I heard that 2015 was becoming Infinity Ward it was really exciting. I really loved their work on Medal of Honor. I saw some early screenshots of Call of Duty and I was, I was a big fan. I couldn't wait to see what they would come up next for Activision. After we had started Infinity Ward we knew that our competition was Medal of Honor. In some ways like I kind of see Medal of Honor Allied Assault as almost like a Call of Duty 0 and we didn't really have any people telling us not to do something. We found a publisher that for the most part you know recognized us as talented group of people and said do your thing and make a good game. I got my start in Call of Duty back in 2003 on the very first Call of Duty, I actually. This is back when like Game Stops weren't around. We had Electronics Boutiques. So I had gone there a couple days early because they had the game early and got the game, that's how big of a fan I was then. I was following the 2015 guys, the Infinity Ward guys since Medal of Honor. So yeah, Call of Duty was like the best new thing it was the hot new thing for us. It was amazing. I just remember like watching all the trailers and seeing the bullet impact effects coming off the walls and the shell shock effects and like the real-time craters that would form in the ground when something went off when an explosion went off. Those for the time in 2003 that was like revolutionary stuff. You didn't see that in other games. Before that we were playing like Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Allied Assault. So you know just visually the game seemed so immersive you're aiming down the iron sights you're bringing up the sights and that hadn't been done before. Those were like just for its time so revolutionary and made myself and all of my friends think that like this is going to be the future. We had to start over from scratch because we were able to redo everything that we did poorly you know. If there was any legacy code that would have created kind of you know that would have created problems in the future we could redo that and basically make a much tighter engine. You know I started with Call of Duty 2 - and really got into that game more so than the first one I played on the PC and just being able to use the same weapons and you know see some of the situations you know it was really actually very interactive and having the dialog in the single-player campaign and just knowing like certain situations that some of these soldiers had to go through I think, that's just, it just blew my mind, you know, and I think that's what draws a lot of people towards videogames. There were a bunch of names thrown around. I remember one of the names we're likely to pick was actually Tour of Duty and I think that at some point along the line I think it might have been Tod Alderman that came up with Call of Duty and we seemed to like that a little bit better and so that's kind of what we stuck with. The building that we were in was ridiculous. It looked like a science fiction book or movie or something. I believe it was like 40 to 50 floors, not sure exactly. It was really tall. It was in the middle of nowhere. It was flatland and then these three giant buildings. We've been making video games for a long time at Gearbox. One of the earliest original things that we created was the series called Brothers in Arms and at the time you know it was really interesting because there was another franchise when we got started there was another franchise called Medal of Honor that was also telling stories about soldiers in world war II and we really wanted to capture the feeling of what it would be like. Medal of Honor was a great game but it was more action-oriented. We wanted to deliver an authentic experience. What's interesting is the Medal of Honor game was so successful that while we were building our game other folks started showing up as well. The Call of Duty franchise got started that same way while we were working on our game they started working on theirs and they showed up a little bit before us with the first Call of Duty game which was a World War II shooter, very much like Medal of Honor. The Brothers in Arms game allowed for tactical gameplay in addition to action skill tests. The first Call of Duty game was so great I mean I don't know if anybody thought about competition I mean we just loved what we were working on, you know. We just knew what we built there was just special. It stood out against other first-person shooter games. Even you know in the same genre. So everybody was just excited about what we're working on and that's what we concentrated on. Landing in the fields there was the cattle there and you know they were using cattle as cover from incoming fire and it was like there'd been shooters before but they hadn't really tried to draw you into that universe and the story element for Call of Duty at the time especially World War II which I was very interested in anyway,and that hadn't been done before and I think that's why it captured my heart. With the team in place and its first game in development Infinity Ward decided to pack their bags and head West. At the time no one really knew about Infinity Ward. In fact i didn't know about Infinity Ward. I was just doing research and I found that there was a game developer not too far from where I lived and they were working on a World War II game which I'm a huge fan of. So I just went over and then you know just wanted to join the team and that's how I got in there and I had no idea about their history with previous titles and stuff like that. But when I joined the team I remember it was about 20 people,was a fairly small size and the team was very unique. I have to say I don't think you can replicate the original team that was there anywhere else. There wre a handful of our developers that were a little bit into world war II history but I think I saw as time went on more and more guys were reading books and watching all the films and the documentaries, so even though it was a job it kind of a little bit of a hobby for a lot of guys. I'm not a big fan of the weapons at that time. I was just like a general artist but since then I have to say, I fell in love with weapons and I studied what is the world war II weapon, what is a modern weapon, how weapons worked, functionally. It helpeds a lot. I learned a lot at the time. As Internet bandwidth improved players began to form their own teams and compete in online gaming leagues. We were playing in at the time with the competitive scene. So we were competing in ladders and leagues and I started to take an interest in mapping and modding. Call of Duty United Offensive came out, the expansion pack to Call of Duty 1 and we were downloading the gtk radiant which was the map editor and we were going in and just playing around goofing off and creating maps and having a good time. We were organizing and planning what kind of mod we wanted to make around United Offensive so that way when COD2 came out we could get the tools and we could go to work. So we made a mod called Unbound Forces and for us we wanted to bring that into the modern day so it was set in 2049. We had the tactical response unit which was like the protagonist force against mercenaries against the mercs. It was a really cool mod for its time. It had a lot of innovations that ultimately ended up being in Call of Duty. I'm not saying that there was influence there but we were definitely going in the right direction. When I was younger I used to compete. I played Doom and I played it competitively and I even played it professionally in a few instances where I played in tournaments and won money and then by the time Quake had come out and taken over I was in the industry as a developer. It was just getting online and playing in lobbies you know. I had a really good internet connection you know, something that a lot of people were kind of lacking back then. I mean it's still, they're still getting better and better but I think just what kind of happened was that I was competitive so the multiplayer was there, the game was available and it became something that I could transition from, you know, playing video games just for like the storylines and the single-player campaigns and then all of a sudden you know you have this multiplayer aspect. Basically there wasn't even a term eSports back then, like it started to loosely to be thrown around because it was essentially created as a marketing term to be able to sell the concept of what these games were as a package to people like sponsors and outside people working in the tech industry or gaming so at the time we never called it that actually. We used to just call it whatever the game we were following was. So initially I followed Quake, so I never thought of it as eSports. It was all competitions for Quake and the impulse was just to watch the best players play basically. We just wanted to see the best action and see the players with the top players battle each other. I grew up playing of course video games like Goldeneye 007, of course a classic and then I discovered Call of Duty and I was like this is so much fun and a lot of my friends played so we would always go online and just play completely just non-stop. Infinity Ward had taken the World War II series to its limits but there was still major ambition to move forward once again. After we finished Call of Duty 2 and it was a good success but you know by then we had actually worked on World War II games for longer than America was involved with World War II so basically we were just really sick of World War II and so we're like hey let's do a modern Call of Duty and so I think Vince and Jason had a meeting, with Activision and said hey we're really pumped about this idea we have helicopters you know,all this cool technology and we're like yeah they're going to love this and like, nope everyone wants World War II. Look at the charts you know everyone's buying it and we hadn't really hit the World War II peak yet. So we made a prototype that was modern-day without Activision knowing and showed it to them they loved it. They're like alright, well sold, so that's when we made Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. In modern warfare you play as multiple characters. British SAS and Marine Force Recon are the main characters in the game. So this is actually the prototype that we made for Activision to show how cool Modern Warfare would be, it's the final version that shipped with the game. So in Modern Warfare you're going to be going to the Middle East, you're going to be going to various regions of Russia. There's a cargo ship on the high seas. It's really a huge variety of gameplay, a huge variety of locations to keep the player enthralled in the game and can keep people guessing as to what's coming next. Jason West, Vince Zampella, Todd Alderman those are like the original guys behind Call of Duty. I met them all before Call of Duty 4 came out. I'd gone out for that community press event. They had an agenda. They needed to sell in all these new ideas that were coming with Modern Warfare. So we knew early on that transitioning from World War II to Modern Warfare and meant having much closer collaboration with the military. So in that regard we set up a lot of field trips to get in really close with a lot of guys who are out there doing their job at that moment. We spent a couple days out in Twenty Nine Palms where we just did field exercises with guys out there. Real Marines doing real life exercises in a mockup city in the desert. It was 110 degrees, the guys were completely exhausted,they had to wear the armor, the helmets, we ran around. It was really exhilarating and tiring and really gave us a new outlook towards what those guys did especially for the developers. We pretty much sit at a desk for most, you know, for the most part. So going out there and being with them understanding what they go through, how they think, how they move, how they talk, how Marines different from Army, how Army's different from SAS really helped inform our storytelling in the game. The transition to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare really gave you this refreshing feeling you know as a Call of Duty fan something that a lot of people were kind of on the fence about I think originally when Infinity Ward announced they're making a Modern Warfare game and it's something that was a little bit outside of the box. But you know as it kind of came closer to launch day they released a Beta of the game and I think that was really instrumental and when people got to play the multiplayer Beta Call of Duty 4 and talked about it with their friends. You know I couldn't stop playing it and it was just so refreshing to have like the M4 the M16 you know and you're learning about the guns. You have the 5.56 round that goes into it so you're literally learning about some of the modern warfare aspects that actually work in the real world. I feel like it was kind of dumb luck by Infinity Ward but those two guys that were a part of it they made the game so competitive and I didn't think they really tried to do it. The game was just, it had the basic settings of it, just appealled to every player, every game that everybody played in Call of Duty 4. Everyone just had an amazing time. Even if you lost you had fun, just because the game played so well, it was so smooth, you know. I think that was one of the first games that produced 60fps. Everything when you played it was just smooth and you don't get that with a lot of games on console. That's only something that you feel on PC and that's why I think it was so successful. There's always games influencing your own games. Our levelling system was 60 levels same as World of Warcraft. The pacing, the amount of time you had to play to level up was actually also very similar with WOW because I think World of Warcraft kind of touched like a very mainstream base. So we looked at experience bars, we looked at ways of having a kind of stand out attribute and characteristics that were very personal to the player and so all these things kind of just made sense to incorporate into a first-person shooter. The perks, the experience bars, ranking up, unlocking weapons. It just took gaming to a whole new level. Map design was just, you know, very very nice to play from a competitive aspect and you just felt like you were in a lot of situations that were fair when you were face to face in a 1 v 1 gunfight. So parts of the map were really important in level design for multiplayer games to make sure that one side of the map isn't more advantageous than the other, right. You always want to make sure there's some kind of level of balance and play and I felt like that was a level design aspect of Call of Duty 4 that was done well. They did an amazing job with that. At first I found it really different, it was futuristic A bit too well done. I started with the Beta The game was futuristic, it was a perfect game. I was squatting like a madman, it was crazy! After success with Modern Warfare, developers Treyarch were assigned to produce a new game returning to World War II. I don't think anybody was certain that Modern Warfare was going to be as successful as it was which is why Treyarch was starting on a World War II game a year before Modern Warfare came out. The team had actually switched away from the COD 3 engine and switched over to what the COD 4 engine was. It was also a follow up to Modern Warfare which was like that was when the franchise entered like mega franchise status. It went from maybe 2 million units to 10 million. World at War was phenomenal. It had such great gameplay. The weapons you know, just the way the story is, it's fantastic. They returned to their roots in the game because you know it was originally a World War game and that's where they went back to, that's what the fans wanted. and World at War pulled in so many people who hadn't played the Call of Duty multiplayer. I felt like it was another refresher, you know. You're bringing that new population that only experienced the Modern Warfare and Call of Duty games back to that World War era with those old players and it just made sense. So you had players actually play both games simultaneously. You would take a party in World at War but go back and play some Call of Duty 4. As Infinity Ward prepared to launch their highly anticipated Modern Warfare sequel not everyone shared the fans and developers enthusiasm. midnight tonight a new and violent video game called Call of Duty Modern Warfare is to be released. It contains such scenes of brutality that even the manufacturers have put in warnings within the game telling people how they can skip particular scenes. Given the recommendations of the Byron Review specifically paragraphs 32 and 33 what steps is the government proposing to take in order to ensure that these violent games do not fall into the hands of children and young people. It's not about censorship it's about protecting our children. The clearest recommendation of the Byron review is that content suitable for adults should be labeled as such and sold as such. It should be an offense to sell such content to children and that's the case under current law. It will be the case under the law when it changes in the digital economy Bill. This game, the game the honorable gentleman refers to is a certificate 18 game. It should not be sold to children and the government's job is to make sure that adult content is clearly labelled and is what adults should be able to get and that children are not in danger of being subjected to adult content. CALL OF DUTY MODERN WARFARE 2 WAS RELEASED IN NOVEMBER 2009 & CONTAINED A "MATURE" & "18+" AGE RATING CERTIFICATE. AGE RATINGS PROVIDE CONCISE & OBJECTIVE INFORMATION ON A VIDEO GAME'S CONTENT. THEY ARE APPLIED & OFFICIALLY RECOGNISED WORLDWIDE. THE GAME'S ALL-FICTITIOUS STORYLINE CONTAINED AN OPTIONAL MISSION "NO RUSSIAN" IN WHICH THE PLAYER WAS PART OF AN ARMED GROUP POTENTIALLY CAUSING MASS DEVASTATION INSIDE A CROWDED RUSSIAN AIRPORT TERMINAL. IN NOVEMBER 2009 BRITISH POLITICIAN RT.HON.KEITH VAZ MP RAISED HIS CONCERN OVER THE GAME'S CONTENT TO THE UK GOVERNMENT & OPPOSITION IN THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT. We really want the player to understand the gravity of the moment and understand how bad the bad guy was and how this was a catalyst to World War III. And in that regard I think we really achieved it. We gave players opportunities to skip that at the beginning of the game to opt out of these things if you don't want to see this material. But we found that really worked well and we weren't doing it for shock value. We're doing to put the player in a position to where war is horrible, horrible things happen and this is a scenario that may or may not take place in our fiction. A lot of us here have kids, you know. Even when we're making a Call of Duty as cool as it wasn't something that we could show our kids obviously for, you know, the violence level that's in the game. So what do I think about the campaign to ban Modern Warfare because of the violence in it.It's a very important question. All I can say is that I think as creators whether it's for video games, movie, television we have to have a point. We have to have a message to send. If we're going to do anything with sex, violence, racism anything, these hot button trigger kind of topics it can't be done irresponsibly. You have to take responsibility for what you're going to show to your viewers because they're taking it in as a story. They're taking it as something that they're participating in and video games it's important that our kids who are under a certain age don't get exposed to that. IN NOVEMBER 2011, FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF CALL OF DUTY MODERN WARFARE 3, BRITISH POLITICIAN RT. HON. KEITH VAZ AGAIN RAISED A SERIOUS ISSUE ON THE GAMES'S CONTENT IN THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT MR. VAZ CALLED ON THE BRITISH BOARD OF FILM CLASSIFICATION (BBFC) TO TAKE FURTHER PRECAUTIONS WHEN ALLOWING A GAME TO BE SOLD. CALL OF DUTY MODERN WARFARE 3 CONTAINED A "MATURE" & BBFC 18+ AGE RATING CERTIFICATE THE BBFC WAS SATISFIED THAT CALL OF DUTY MODERN WARFARE 3 CONTAINED NO MATERIAL THAT REQUIRED RESTRICTION BEYOND THE "18" CLASSIFICATION. THE GUIDELINES AT "18" ACCEPT THE PRINCIPLE, REPEATEDLY ENDORSED BY THE PUBLIC, THAT ADULTS SHOULD BE FREE TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN ENTERTAINMENT IN THE ABSENCE OF LEGAL ISSUES OR MATERIALS WHICH RAISE A RISK OF HARM. The Modern Warfare series had broken all previous sales records. Its publisher decided the time was right to make a difference outside of the video gaming community and put something back. The Call of Duty Endowment was founded in late 2009 by Bobby Kotick. Bobby really wanted to find a way to give back to veterans, you know, as a group that has certainly inspired many Call of Duty games and as a group of people who he just felt were really in need. So that was the genesis of it and you know I think the specific focus on putting vets in jobs was also really important because it's born out over time that we've learned, giving a vet a job when they come back, helping them find a job is the best way to help them reintegrate into society. The Call of Duty endowment is such an amazing thing and I'm really glad that Activision had chosen to give back to those who, you know, give us our freedom. So we get a lot of fans that are in the military and to see them play the game and just to be able to give back to them is just a blessing. The notion of volunteering, raising your hand and saying I'll do anything that's a virtue in the military. In the civilian world when you're looking for a job and you go to an employer and say I'll do anything, that's actually a hindrance. That's something that companies don't know how to react to. So there's things veterans have to be taught on their way out or transitioning service members really have to be taught so they can be successful in the civilian world when they get out. They've got all the fundamentals right. They've got hard work, they've got great experience of leadership, they've got discipline they have creativity, they have adaptability, they have teamwork. They just need to know how to talk about that more effectively to essentially learn how to sell themselves. There's a Marine, severely wounded Marine who was speaking at a major investment bank in New York one day and he was talking about the value of hiring veterans. And a banker stood up and said look it's great what you're doing I really applaud that but I got to be honest with you, I'm worried if we hire a vet is this veteran going to go postal on us? And New Yorkers being New Yorkers they tend to speak their minds but the Marine took it in stride he said okay fair question let me ask you this - How many of you here in this New York Investment Banking office were here on 9/11. About half the room raised their hands and said yeah we were here. So the Marine then asked did any of you have any of you since ever maybe had some fear about going up a tall building, maybe lost some sleep, maybe gotten a little distracted at work at times. A lot of heads were nodding and said you may have post-traumatic stress but that doesn't make you a bad banker, that doesn't mean you can't be effective in your job if you have the right help and counseling. It's just one more issue people have to deal with. Treyarch were given the task to produce something in a dark and more sinister era. A time of covert operations and classified missions, espionage and the threat of nuclear war. So being able to make a whole game like Black Ops the gloves were off. We were in the Cold War era and then because it was Black Ops because it was black operations, these deniable ops, these deniable missions we also didn't need to adhere strictly to historical authenticity. We could take some creative liberties with the stories we were telling because it's like well, you know, how do you know that this didn't happen during the Cold War. How do you know this wasn't one of those classified missions. There were some other names Call of Duty Cold War was an obvious one, Call of Duty Vietnam. Back when it was much more Vietnam slanted of a game than bigger black ops and we were able to work with Activision to focus test all these different names and see what resonated best with people and Black Ops ultimately was like far and away like the right decision. By 2010 the Modern Warfare series had broken new records. Highly acclaimed by critics and fans, Activision had made a blockbuster. And the BAFTA goes to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. And the BAFTA goes to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. Wow, well, on behalf of everybody at Infinity Ward back in Los Angeles California. Thank you for this award. It means a lot. Every one of us, we're just a team of just under 100 people so we consider ourselves very small and we're all personally invested in this game. So this means a lot so thank you very much. That Steelcase is autographed by Gary Oldman. We started getting a lot of more thletes and celebrities that love Call of Duty who wanted to come see our studio and I got to meet the entire Dodgers lineup and I'm a huge Dodgers fan. And the game award of 2008 goes to who else but Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. I think Vince and Jason went to their regular Monday meeting over at Activision in Santa Monica. And they didn't come back. I was in London. I was on a press tour and I just remember getting done with a series interviews and just checking my emails and, it's like, are you kidding me?, is this actually happening? Where's Vince and Jason? Vince Zampella and Jason West were fired by Activision for insubordination and immediately left Infinity Ward. The next day we had security people outside our office. Wearing regular civilian clothes with walkie talkies, they just watched us go into our office. As a team we just stayed really focused and you know we empathized with all of our friends and colleagues who were over there who were caught up in the middle of it and you know we wanted to be supportive of that and empathetic of that and at the same time like there was just so much like you had a tiptoe with, just how high-profile that legal thing was. Keeping records and needing to go to meetings and tell your side of the story. It was a tough time for everybody involved. Everyone loved Vince and Jason. They were just a huge part of the success of the game and as soon as they were fired we were kind of freaking out. IN 2010 JASON WEST & VINCE ZAMPELLA FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST ACTIVISION FOR WRONGFUL CONTRACT TERMINATION & ALLEGED AROUND $36 MILLION WAS OWED IN UNPAID ROYALTIES IN RESPONSE ACTIVISION FILED IT'S OWN COUNTER-COMPLAINT STATING THAT JASON WEST & VINCE ZAMPELLA'S LAWSUIT CLAIMS WERE MERITLESS. Multibillion-dollar lawsuits followed and after two years the court battles were settled. Vince Zampella and Jason West formed a new studio - Respawn Entertainment. Activision brought in new developers, Sledgehammer games, to continue work alongside Treyarch and Infinity Ward on the Call of Duty series. The business and machinery side of our industry often would wish us to do what is reliable and what we've done before and just do it again and do it a little bit better next time. But a creative wants to take risks and try new things and so we see it all over our industry where sometimes creative talent doesn't want to just keep making the same game that the business machine wants them to make and sometimes there's a split. We saw with the creative people that created Infinity Ward at Activision, left and started a new studio that made Titanfall, what a brilliant creative new angle. We saw that the folks that created Halo with Microsoft regained their independence and offered us Destiny. Call of Duty is such a big game you have to consider the multiplayer side, the single-player side, the Spec Ops side and how the features that you're creating really integrates with all those. Specifically with the Call of Duty formula you got people like Vonderhaar who have to have to craft these incredibly complex basically living organisms at the end of the day when you look at what a multiplayer game is. It runs at a higher frame rate and it looks so smooth and plays so well. This is part of the reason why people love it. It's not something that's glitchy, it's not something that's buggy. The goal of the game always in multiplayer was to keep the speed up so there's always intense action and something new happening. The game gets really competitive. Especially when you start building a massive kill streak and everyone starts focusing down on you. And the more kills you get, the more kill streaks you get, the harder you become to kill, the more everyone tries to focus you down. Kill streaks function as a reward to the player. So as a player is doing well they're rewarded with extra points. As they build up these points then they get to unleash a kill streak. What a killstreak is is a special ability, so it could be a unique weapon, it could be a defensive ability that enhances the entire team, it could be an offensive action that takes out a whole bunch of enemies. So this is the UI from this game, the kill streaks are on the left here.I'll show you right here, it's a simple little system that tells you how many kills you need to get to get the next kill streak each of those icons with light up. It's essentially like it keeps you on the edge of your toes while you're playing the game because you want to do really well. It makes you try hard you don't want to die. You have to get a certain number of kills in a row without dying to be able to get a kill streak and then the more and more kills that you get without dying the higher level kill streak you're rewarded. You got to have high sensitivity to play Call of Duty. I think, especially because it's getting around the corners with shot guns and stuff. That's what it's all about. And especially when you start to form teams around this game and you've all got microphones and talk to each other, that's where a lot of fun comes from. Being able to coordinate plans, attack, converging, you know, plotting a bomb this way. The fact that teamwork comes in is a great point for the Call of Duty franchise. Good players tend to memorize which killstreaks they have and how many kills they've made so that as they're playing in their mind they have a count going of 1, 2, 3, I've got my UAV 4. 5, I can put out my next one things like that so it really gets you. It puts the pressure on to not die. The mappers had a really hard time. they're the unsung heroes because you take it for granted you run around a level you think about the weapons you think about the kill streaks you think about the game-mode and people take the map for granted. And it really takes someone with a really innate knowledge of flow to be able to design a space that'll work so that everybody can be in there running around together have places to hide have lots of places to shoot other people. And so there's completely different things and so when they're always looking for successful ways to accomplish those. A lot of times they'll go back to the favorite Maps the classics Crossfire things like that that all the fans love. And try to look at what are the key points of this map that create this fun. Every little detail, every little facet of when you walk through a multiplayer map is scrutinized to the umpteenth degree like you can't imagine how many hours are spent just pining over every little detail. Whether a window should be an inch higher inch lower. Whether a waterfall should be to the left, to the right. What that does to the view distance, what that does to the sight lines of the map, you know. It's all part of it, all of that adds up to what is the magical Call of Duty formula. The eSports players would sit in with our play test. We would play test all the time every day more than once a day often, especially when we are getting towards the end and be able to get immediate visceral feedback. So you can give someone a game and tell them to write a questionnaire but if you're watching them play the body language everything they say while they're playing things like that. Their enthusiasm or lack of enthusiasm after they play all these things give you amazing amounts of feedback. Fast action multiplayer mode requires full hand to eye physical ability but not everybody has these gifts. Crouch Jump Run Duck If I wasn't disabled I would probably have been a soldier. A lot of people play multiplayer games, they play online but for me campaign mode is really important you know I can play video games but I'm never going to be as good as able-bodied people. For me, I love story the single-player campaign for a Call of Duty title was always an exciting thing to work on. We had really big budgets to get the best writers, the best actors, great motion capture people. Everything we needed to do a huge film like summer blockbuster production. The campaign mode is something special because it has a great storyline to it and when you're playing in campaign mode you know just playing it feels like you completely immersed into it. You're following the story and you're completely locked into that game and for me as a disabled person you know to be playing a game which you're totally immersed in feels like i'm out of my body and into someone else's body playing a game which is a kind of out of body experience. Okay to play Call of Duty I use a chin joystick which basically acts like a mouse. If you move the cursor around and look around and when I playing Call of Duty it actually lets me control the camera. So I can rotate to different angles and aim when I want to shoot and to fire I use my button which is next to my hand. It's just a soft switch. And to move forward backwards and change weapons. I use a program called GlovePie which is a voice recognition application and the way it works, you can actually map keyboard keys to voice commands so I can say the word forward and the character would move forward. I can say left or right and the character would move left or right. But more importantly it also lets me do things like change weapons. I say change and it would switch from a rifle to a handgun or if I say the word grenade it would then throw a grenade. I work 9 to 5 every day supporting many users around the UK with IT problems so I do that full time. Call of Duty ranks number one. Because I know what to expect when I buy a Call of Duty game. I know I'm not going to be disappointed it it's going to have good animation good effects. It's going to have a rhythm to it and the storyline it's always going to be immerseful and it's going to make you follow the characters and it's not going to disappoint. Getting the story, getting into the characters. Creating the settings of what really is going to be happening in this world and the story of creating. It's always something that's been really fun for me. Actors interestingly enough,most of them are really big fans of Call of Duty so don't need convincing about coming on board. It's pretty funny actually what they do when they're casting for video games.With video games it's all top-secret. Everything's top-secret, for instance when I did Assassins Creed or Call of Duty I didn't know what game I was going in for. Call of Duty was called Eclipse. It wasn't called Call of Duty Black Ops 2 and the character I was going in for was not even called Raman. It was like Hassan or something like that and I got an audition piece it was like two pages of script and I must have had maybe four lines and no clue what the scene was about other than my character interacting with this other character and being a little bit of a badass. Completely out of context of the story. So I did that and she gave me a little direction the casting director I think it was Ivy, Ivy Isenberg who did that and I did it again she said great. Next thing, you know, you get called up hey you got the job on Eclipse and just so, you know, it's actually Call of Duty Black Ops 2 but don't tell anybody. Every major movie star, all the big A-list stars are telling their production companies telling their managers,look for my video game. I want to find my video game. Either you create one for me if you're a big enough A-list star or wait for the right game to come along and request that I be in it because that's going to put me in a completely different world to a whole bunch of new people and it's going to build my fan base and consequently augment my success and my reach and my marketability and just give me more of what it is that makes a successful actor successful which is clout power. There are these different certification milestones you go through with Microsoft and Sony and you have to make sure that the game is all ready to be created on disc but there's ask the actual physical part sending out to a factory so that that factory can make the millions of discs that are needed which is, you know, a little bit different for a Call of Duty franchise than some other franchises. Once we hit the gold version that means it's like the ready to ship version we celebrate in-house. So I remember that we had a champagne party and then we bring in some guests and it was fun for the gold version. And then when you're launching we celebrate at store in the local so we went there at night on the guest list. So many people are lining up we went there all together, we had some events with signings of the posters and giving them to fans and stuff, we celebrate that way. So Call of Duty always brings a lot of audiences out of the woodwork and into these launches that we have at midnight and we never really anticipated how much people were looking forward to our games. We're just making a game. We all work at a desk just doing our thing so it's really kind of exciting and crazy to finally leave that bubble and see the real world and everything going on. For a lot of us that week leading up to a launch meant going out on press junkets talking to the press go to different parts of the world and having launch parties, just getting everyone to understand the developers and meet the developers. For some guys, the coders, the designers and the unsung heroes that had to stay and burn the midnight oil they were making last-minute fixes so that when the game launched it was stable it was solid it was fun. The reason why I queued up for six days and five nights outside Oxford Street was to be first to get Black Ops 2. I'd been to previous midnight launches and I decided that I wanted to be first. I was currently at University. I kind of didn't tell my lecturer but I took a few days off. I brought roughly about three gallons of water with me. I had a really big red rucksack and carried one of those pop-up tents which unfortunately wasn't waterproof. I found out one night the hard way and I had a sleeping bag, my sister's military sleeping bag which should have kept me quite warm, which it did until it rained. The evenings I must admit were very cold and most evenings I kind of drifted in and out of sleep so I'd be awake for two hours and I'd fall asleep again for another hour and a half then watch a film in the middle of the night and it was mostly just periods of awake time and sleep just kind of melted into each other because I'd start sleeping during the day you know I'd be awake at night and it was just kind of all patchy really. There was a lot of mixed reactions for when I was camping on the street like I'd say half of the people were almost thinking of me like I'm crazy I don't know why you'd want to do that you're taking time out of your own free thing to just sit here on the street and I'd say the other half of people they were thinking exactly the same thing but they were saying well done. Because I was so cold a lot of the time it actually took a lot of energy to keep my body warm I was eating junk food but ended up losing weight at the end of the week which is crazy. So on the evening of the launch the atmosphere was really exciting. I was let in the store first and they had all these people come in like taking pictures of me and doing videos and stuff and I got to stand right at the front of the crowd when we watched the show with Mr Pointy head is wax=s really good.But they didn't tell us what was actually going to happen in the store at the point of the midnight release. So all the lights went out in the store and they played zombie music from Black Ops and it was really awesome like they were really scary they had actual blood dangling from their faces and their contact lenses in you'd completely mistaken them for real zombies. It was really cool going up on the stage meeting Mr Pointy Head. I was standing there in front of this sea of people so I would see all these camera lenses and all these faces and phones pointed in my direction So the producers of Black Ops II were actually there. They were signing game copies and I gave him my game copy of Black Ops 2 and he was going to sign it for me and he kind of looked me up and down and just went: You're crazy you know that. And then he actually signed the game box and he wrote "you are mental" and his signature and then just gave it back to me and he's like thank you so much for queuing up for this game it really means a lot to us. I wouldn't take the week back because you know after it's all over I got a little bit sad. I'm not going to be waiting in the queue anymore for the game and once you've got it it's a little bit kind of like, oh my the launch is all over but then you got to play this awesome game so it kind of works out. Call of Duty really started mostly online with Modern Warfare One, still probably the most popular game amongst the pro players. This was where Call of Duty Esports really began. The way I got into it was just by playing a lot and getting better and just meeting the right people. If you want to be a recognized pro player and you want to be that guy that does it you need to have three people on your team that you enjoy playing with. How these teams normally form is everyone thinks they're the best when you get in the lobby and you finish in first place and you're beating up on some other guys who are a little bit less skilled you get really confident. You start by just having fun and if you enjoy it you play it more. if you enjoy even more you play some more and all of a sudden you're playing with people who are also good and then all of a sudden you're in a better team and a better team and a better team. It's no different from sport. We're not reinventing the wheel here, simply as a case of where you put on a pair of football boots and go and kick a ball about now you're picking up a gaming pad or a mouse or a keyboard and just playing. You want to find that one partner that you want to work with after that you'll see a lot of two pairs join up to create a four man team or after just playing other opponents you'll recognize the best player from an opposing team and try and bring them on to yours. TO BEGIN WITH, I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT AT ALL, I WAS PLAYING FOR FUN. AT FIRST, I DID NOT THINK THAT THERE THERE WAS YOUTUBE WHICH WAS ON A BIG SCALE SPONSORS WHO ARRIVED, TEAMS WHO WOULD PAY, ETC., ETC... I SAID TO MYSELF GO FOR IT, IT'S GOOD, SO I STOPPED EVERYTHING AND THREW MYSELF INTO IT. I AM PLEASED TO BE WHERE I AM IT'S MY PASSION When you get into a match when you're playing for a lot of money and you know there's a lot on the line you can lose at any time, and that's the issue with Call of Duty. It's a day-to-day game. No matter how good a team you are you there's always the possibility of losing because every team has a possibility of coming out and just shocking the world. No matter how heavily favorited one team could be another team could win that's just how Call of Duty is just because there's such low health and kills are so easy to get. You'll see a lot of team changes amongst the top. There's probably about sixty-four guys that could win a tournament at any point in time. Even a lot of these players in their own right are celebrities themselves. They have hundreds and thousands of followers on Twitter they go out and people recognize them in the airports. So it's really cool to see everything that they're doing. I OFTEN GO TO SUBSCRIBER CONVENTIONS WHERE I CAN MEET MY FANS THEY ARE HUGE, THEY ARE THERE TO CHEER US ON IN THE COMPETITIONS AND ON TWITTER, "GO GUYS!" THOSE CONVENTIONS WHERE THERE ARE 200, 300 PEOPLE... IT IS AMAZING; THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO SAY A lot of players will be amazing online but when they come to a LAN and you know the atmosphere's here they know they got to perform there's thousands of people watching, they kind of crumble. The coaches now we see are motivational tools. So if a team loses you know if they go 2-0 down in the best-of-five series and you know the heads go down and they start getting demotivated the coaches are there to say guys what are you doing, pick this up this is our chance we're going to win this try and rally the troops if you will and get them motivated for the rest of the game and see if they can now come back. Very rare you'll see coaches actually getting statistical data of different things in the game where people are respawning etc. The coach is a really important part of any team. If he sees a player that normally is going to be the lead slayer struggling before the player even gets some doubt in his mind the coach should be there and tell him don't worry you're going to get the next kill keep focused. He is the one that keeps everyone on the same page keeps everyone on track and really if he's doing his job right the team is going to stay pumped up they're going to stay happy they're going to keep communicating regardless if they're winning or losing in every single game. When they do have a coach there's somebody who has this outside perspective that's able to see things that's a little bit different and they're able to hype up their teams and really kind of give them advice on where to go. Oliver Sellers is a Call of Duty team coach with mainstream sporting grandfather Ron Atkinson was first team manager of English soccer giants Manchester United As a team manager - I like to be very involved with the players from day to day getting what they need whether it be a simple thing,whether they've got the right stuff to be able to practice at the highest level. Whether that means we get them, anything, from new gaming monitors the big thing now is that people didn't realize three four years ago how important having a top brand gaming monitor is. It's like any sports having the best pair of football boots having the the best cricket bat.It's about getting anything and getting your players the best and allow them to perform.Then there's no saying what they can do. My Grandad he is a big part of my life. I would love to get him to go to an event one day. I think he'd really be able to see the comparisons between a major sport and Esports in as much as they're physically playing on the field we're playing on a screen. He's been a commentator he'd be able to see what they're doing for game, what managers are doing for a game, between games talking to his team like at half-time,him getting them in dressing room you can turn the team around.It would just be great to see him getting in the environment see what it is. Counter strike looks similar to Call of Duty. It remains one of the biggest titles in professional Esports. Hello everyone and welcome to the latest stop on the Dreamhack tour we are here in London, England. No applause,disappointed. I thought we were getting a much bigger shout than that, there we are. I think the people who put it in place, the mechanisms that made it big now couldn't have had a clue how successful it would be.What basically happened was for the first year maybe just over a year and two months or Counter Strike Global Offensive was not a big game it wouldn't even have been in most people's top three in terms of the biggest Esports games, the most important ones with good prize money and a big circuit. So player salaries were very low and actually with the usual lifespan of games if you don't make it in the first year you're basically dead in the water, it's usually over at that point. So it should have been over and what actually happened was Valve had this weird idea which I still don't understand how it worked which was to add in the skin economy to the game and create skins. A skin is just what the gun looks like. Having a better skin doesn't make the gun perform better doesn't make you perform better. It's just something that looks cool okay, but then someone had the genius idea that you could actually gamble your skins. The thing you gamble the skins on is in the Pro matches and then, say they lose, they'll think right well if I'm going to gamble in a pro match again I better know who this team game or not, so you're naturally finding a way for people who otherwise wouldn't normally be inclined to get really into Esports. It's almost like a little cookie trail, I keep following it through and eventually they're in eSports. They were just a casual gamer before but they followed this natural route of, okay I'm getting skins I've got a good skin collection,I want better ones and I'm gambling them and suddenly they're an eSports fan. I think what Call of Duty brought was more of an arcade feel in terms of just regular matches and game play. You know you had hardcore modes that were more akin to Counter-Strike but trying to make it more palatable for the everyday person who is still interested in World War II shooters and modern-day shooters so that they can respond and get back into the action. And in terms of gunplay and feel there was a lot of innovation that was done even though Counter Strike did have kick and variance with spread but I think Call of Duty took that to another level in terms of adding more feel to the weapons. In Call of Duty you find how you move in the world feels a lot more smoother and was definitely a marked difference that made it a lot easier for people to jump in. How can you boil down the essence of why people want to watch an eSports game? I actually think what it comes down to is most of the time it's just like watching any sport. It's just a normal thing and you have a little bit of vested interest and you are like okay, I hope that player plays well but because they're the best players every now and then they will pull off a move that's so perfect and superlative in it's quality that you almost couldn't even visualize it was possible but when it's happening you just know it's brilliant. Playing in a tournament and making a play,just hearing a crowd roar you know hearing people cheer for you. I mean that's a feeling that you just can't beat and really gives you a sense of worth. When the big plays happen when a player goes off and does something crazy you can then look down at the booths and see that player reaction live as it happens. You can see how intense they all are but most of the focus is going to be around just listening to the commentators and hearing what's going to be going on and really getting involved in the experience.And you've got massive speakers so you feel like you're in the game yourself and it's just a really awesome experience. For me it's all about telling a narrative and I can go from blistering play-by-play and just going for it and explain the hype in a moment to checking engagements. I'm talking about a narrative if it's slowed down or there's nothing going on. I need to explain that this is a very good spawn rotation or they did really well staying alive here,this is what they're looking at,this is where they're going. It's difficult sometimes to comment caster is perfect no driver is perfect you're never going to get everything at one point,but you try to keep up as much as possible. So I'm basically looking everywhere. I'm looking at the mini-map for engagement, I'm looking at the strategy, the timer to know how long is left,all the strategies they can put in,what spawns they have. All this goes into where I'm directing and going for it and it may be I'm hitting on a player doing well or it may be I'm talking about an upcoming rotation or cut they've got in the map,any number of things or something that could be focussed on. You have to support this with everything else that any other traditional mainstream sport has. There has to be advertising dollars there has to structure to the leagues and the tournaments. I'd say the average salary for even a top Pro is probably like a hundred thousand and that's probably a good one there's probably some on fifty thousand.The people who make the most money in general, because it's coming top down from investment. It's like the person who's at the top level of the tournament organizer and the person who owns a team and then the person who, yeah what else would it be, like an agent or something and much like most sports it's only at the end that tends to be the player who becomes the guy that makes the most. In 2013 as Esports continued to grow Activision confirmed its own global tournament the COD Championships. Call of Duty Esports had now officially begun There was the Call of Duty championships the million dollar tournament put on by Activision and Treyarch out in Hollywood. Impact were able to take the tournament and Bank $400,000 so they won three out of their first three major tournaments as a squad together. $550,000 in the space of a month and a half. That's just that's just crazy and the only reason they did that was because they put so much time into the game. Team impact were crowned kings of the world and looked unstoppable. But soon after their winning streak the global COD champions were defeated at a major event in California by an ambitious new outfit - team Complexity. Two weeks later on a hot summer's day in London Impact would go head-to-head with Complexity once again. Impact were beaten. They were so devastated the team broke up after this event. The professional COD scene was now set for a new dynasty. Complexity were about to achieve a winning streak so great they would write themselves into Esports history. When it comes to a team well-rounded well prepped having a strength in every area there is not much that could contest it. They had everything from an in-game leader, even two in game leaders to some of the best players in the game individually.It were frightening how good they are. They were great in every regard they were very very skilled, they were highly motivated they had the mental game better than most.Doesn't matter how many matches that were taken off them, they always predicted them to come back and they just outsmarted everybody, it was the perfect storm. We played against them four or five times everytime we lost,they always win regardless.They'd still end up winning and they did pull through somehow.It was very difficult playing against them, probably the hardest team Ive had to play against. Matt Morello, in game he was the hype man he would build them up, he would take their confidence so high, the mental game was just phenomenal and playing against that and having Matt standing over them if you were face to face, it's something that as a player it was difficult because you've got this guy who's not even playing and he's just telling you you're awful and this guy is amazing. He was the one that if something went wrong and you could tell it was a odd shade of time where the team would maybe have lost their composure a little in their heads. He was there to put that back in place. But they were always one step ahead. I remember them being at ESWC and they were unsure about some of the tactics they were using and were thinking about changing the way they were playing and for me that was unbelievable. I said "guys you've maybe got two hours left of playing this ever and you're sitting there changing up the tactics you're using going into your next game". Changing a player's position and a player's role because you didn't think it was clicking well enough. Professional Esports performed at the very highest level is monopolized by male players and teams. For women the scene is very different. Most of the guys are afraid to be beaten by a girl because it seems like an unwritten rule that guys should be good at gaming or Counter-Strike or anything but when a girl comes and does it better than you? It's hard to make a living out of it for the girls because there's not enough support so we can't spend as much time on gaming as the guys in competitive terms anyway. Riot gaming are an all-female Call of Duty team from the UK who had to face a series of commercial and gender issues. We don't not want to team with boys it's more of boys don't really want to team with girls. it is a male-dominated game and I've noticed that through the years.It started to show and be brought into companies not wanting to sponsor certain female teams. We had a big name sponsor not willing to sponsor us just because of the whole girl thing and how it's know portrayed online but our stats and our marketing was far better than some of the other teams it sponsored. So that was kind of a blowback. If you're getting abuse from a male as a female it's normally "get back in the kitchen" that sort of stuff,and yes it can get bad and escalate but you just ignore it. It just sort of gets to a point where you want to just prove them all wrong just to show them that we can exceed the expectations and rise above everything that they're saying. After hearing it a few times you learn to move past it and just get carry on your life.Just let them do what they want because it's not really doing anything to you. For a woman to enter a male-dominated area some people are very judgmental. Other females,maybe their peers that don't play games might judge them on that. maybe lean into them for that and it doesn't help that the males who also play are giving the girls a lot of flack. More girls are coming out to play and there are actually decent females out there that are playing this game themselves. It's not as bad as it once was but it's still there and it still needs to be addressed I guess. The console generation is always going to be a young generation,a bit more immature and you do see it rub off on social media. There's no reason they can't play in these tournaments with men there's no reason we can't have mixed teams. I've seen it happen in Counter Strike before,COD4 on PC there's no reason they can't be in this industry. In 2013 for the first time in video gaming history the worlds two major console brands would launch their next generation machines in the same month of the same year. After Modern Warfare 3 we were looking at where did we want to take the Call of Duty franchise? There are a lot of different ideas, you know all over the place, like any game company.People also started to look at what did Modern Warfare bring to the franchise,who are the iconic characters and which characters that weren't explored and what does that mean.That inevitably led to the people who are core to coming up with a story, to look at, hey Ghost is a very iconic and interesting character what is the story of this character? what could be the story of characters who had this kind of iconic imagery and let's build something out of that. So that's the roots and seeds of where Ghosts came from. We were always a very efficient team. I think COD 4 was made with like 60 something people and when I left right at the end of Ghosts we had 300 people. Of course we had good relationships with both Sony and Microsoft but with any next generation it's always about, hey you know we have bigger budgets for memory bigger budgets for effects bigger budgets for poly counts. There was a lot of extra work with the next-gen consoles more high-resolution models textures so in the end you have to hire more artists. The biggest challenge actually was not so much the next-gen it was being able to support next-gen and current gen at the exact same time. So that's where you know the challenge is because you want to develop a game that looks amazing on the next-gen platform but then also runs on the current gen. Can we construct this in such a way that it works for both or do we just have two sets of models right, one for current gen one for next-gen. So that's kind of where a lot of the wrangling came in. Hey,we made this one game it looks amazing on you know, next-gen now let's make sure that everything works on previous gen. In Los Angeles four years after departing Infinity Ward Vince Zampella and his Respawn team made their comeback. When Respawn broke off from Infinity Ward and started working on Titanfall it's pretty clear that was the game they wanted to make Call of Duty into. And that was the game that ultimately Call of Duty started to go in that direction right.That's not a mistake those guys are smart those guys are creative geniuses.I wouldn't say that Titanfall didn't do well I think Titanfall did better than anybody had expected. For a new IP for a new franchise to be able to sell four five six million units or more I'm sure by now, that's incredible for a new IP that's an overwhelming success. Any time you start a new IP just like Call of Duty 1. Call of Duty One was not a huge game it was big but not really that big. And I think you're going to see the same thing with Titanfall. You know Titanfall is a really extremely polished game, really tight gameplay and it's just fun to play over and over and over. Titanfall is a great game, it's sales don't represent how good of a game it is. You need a brand and Call of Duty is a huge brand now. You know it took many years to get that brand recognition and Titanfall hasn't have the time to get the brand recognition yet. Mechanically it is fantastic and the gameplay is superb.The issue being, it was massively hyped. It was massively hyped to be this great game.I played it early and I played the demo.I played the Beta and the point being,the Beta was basically the full game. I'm wondering whether or not it was rushed out at the end. It did feel like it at points.There didn't seem to be enough kind of diversity to keep the player going and it kind of lacked that moment that Call of Duty has where you feel like oh "this is a great play let me tell you about this" there were not enough of those moments in Titanfall. You can objectively look at that game as a developer and you can pick up some stuff that just wasn't quite right. It wasn't quite magical but they were doing something really revolutionary and really new.For that it was more than what it received in appreciation. Hollywood screenwriter William Goldman once described the non-existent formula in making a successful movie as nobody knows nothing. As technology continues to evolve the same words can be applied to the future of video gaming. Throughout the entire human history the form of entertainment always has been something where the audience is sitting sitting on a chair,removed from the stage and the show is happening just on the stage and that's been the case for thousands of years. Even think about TV, movies, you're still sitting on your chair and things are happening away from you, apart from you. Virtual reality, what makes it special is that for the first time for the very first time,you are no longer the audience, you are right in the middle of the action, you can look around if there's an enemy coming behind you. You can totally look back and see it coming from behind you and all these things are happening around you. It's not happening within the confined space of this box in front of your eyes. So that makes the experience very different. If I had to predict the future for Call of Duty, I'd see it becoming more like Counter Strike where they have a base Call of Duty game and they just keep building on that rather than releasing a new one every year. I think they are going to, at some point release one game and they are just going to build on that for three or four years. They can have loads of maps. They can keep updating it and it's just going to be this solid Call of Duty franchise. The game would just be Call of Duty and that will be the shooter that people play. I think it's going to go back to World publisher there's only so far you can go pushing stuff and they've done a lot of current stuff and they're pushing into sort of near future weaponary. How many more maps can they make? I don't know. Everytime I see a DLC pack there's always an old fan favorite thrown in.We had Skyrise which is a remake of Highrise for Advanced there are some great COD maps that have been released in the past so I think as long as they've got a good team yeah they can make as many as they want. We are always thinking about virtual reality and how we can make a game in virtual reality. There's a lot of limitations on the performance side because of the way VR works and how much you have to render with it for each eye and the fact that we have to tone it down a little. And the Toon will fit perfectly with all the things we're thinking about.Performance, fun factor, style, doing things in VR that may not seem so grounded but they're just so fun because it's VR. I wish I could tell you what they're going to do. I mean the developers are really really smart they've now got a three year development cycle rather than two years,they've got longer to develop their game so they've got more time to be creative and do new things. So I don't know, maybe they will move towards the VR experience where you're literally playing Call of Duty as if you're in the battlefield. For me it would be much better, if video game developers would be more aware about the needs of disabled people and rather than making games where they have disabled people in them, I'd prefer it and many disabled people would prefer it, that they would make games that disabled people could play.They want to be able to play games they don't want to be in the games, you know, so that would make a huge difference. If programmers and developers will take time to conside when developing games for everyone. Since 2009 Dan Goldenberg and his team have helped over 22,000 ex-service military veterans get themselves into high-quality jobs. The work is ongoing Call of Duty's future prospects remain infinite and the official World League has created a permanent home for its elite Esports teams. But the game developers will know that to remain at the top, innovation and creativity must always come first, so too, must reaching out to a highly loyal and passionate community of fans. UTAH BEACH, NORMANDY, FRANCE But as time marches on the world must never forget Call of Duty's origins and meanings.Where it all began and what happened on these beaches in 1944. The men and women who sacrificed served and gave their lives in World War Two went above and beyond the Call of Duty. They are, and will always be remembered as The Greatest Generation.
