Hello, my name is Ageng. I just turned 64. I'm just a nobody. Nothing special about me. Why are traditional rituals important? To keep us from harm in the course of life. Harm caused by black magic, or a "bad" day. For example, "Wekasan Wednesday". What is Wekasan Wednesday? Did I say that right? When a child is born on that day, we will need to perform a ritual on them. Cutting off their "sukerto". What's a "sukerto"? The misfortunes that the baby carries, they can be stopped that day. So their life can be better. What do you need to do to avoid this day's misfortunes? I have a way. My own way. As we can see here, the baby's size is consistent with the age of the pregnancy. Good health. Congratulations, ma'am. Your husband must be thrilled. How do I pay? We only accept cash. The government insurance doesn't cover this. THE WOMB 16 weeks. Okay. Okay? That's it? What do you want me to say? You won't keep it, right? It? You bastard! Sure, you enjoyed the sex. Then you knocked me up, and act like this? Asshole! If you want an abortion, let's do it. Let's find a clinic together. But other than that, you're on your own. I'm not putting my life on hold just for this. For the doctor's bill. Moms! To spice up your marriage, we have all kinds of pills to keep your husband going! We also have contraception… You have hair in your mouth! Shut the fuck up! We have fruits, mangoes, -Put them back! -rambutans… -But I want them. -We also have products for your kids. -Put them back. -We have condensed milk… -I want them. -No! Put them back! We have powdered milk, -What's her problem? -everything for your family. Moms, enjoy our best deals! We have milk for your kids to grow up healthy. -What's with you? -Shut up. We also have honey from Banten to lift up your mood. You think you take good care of your daughter? Did you ever pay for Wulan's meals? -I take care of everything! -Fuck you! No one respects me out there! I work day and night for my family! And this is what I go home to? You're a wife but you speak like a slut! You're fucking useless! Fuck you! I've worked my ass out and I got no respect from you! Wulan! What did Heru say? What would an asshole say? I told you, you're too gullible. If you want to preach, go to the mosque. Listen, bitch. I'm not preaching. I'm just telling you. Seeing you like this makes me sad, too. Let it go. Don't waste your time on that jerk. Better focus on what to do with this. Well, well, well. I've been looking all over for you girls. Mind if I join in? Sir. What? It's dirty. Sir. Stop here! This is not what I ordered. -I'm not paying for it. -I can't pay my rent now. -Complain to the shop. -I'll find the money. I'll take the motorbike if you don't pay! You've opened the package, so you have to pay. No! Take it back! You can't complain to me, call the shop. -Thanks, ma'am. -Sure. Hey, the door's opened. Don't worry about it. SUPPORT GROUP FOR EXPECTING MOTHERS That smile of yours means you have no money. Your smile won't work on me this time. If everyone paid rent with a smile, my dad would kill me. I haven't gotten my paycheck. So, when? Later this month, okay? You've been saying that for the past two months. Someone called me looking for a place. If you can't pay by midmonth, I'm giving them yours. Got it? Yes. Zubaidah! Zubaidah? It's Bella. Fine, don't be mad. Let's go check out your room. Zubaidah or Bella? Let's fool around while we're at it. RAT POISON Rat problem at home? It's not as scary now as the pictures you see on the net. A drug is all it takes to kill it. Even if it doesn't work, you just have to lie down during the procedure. -You won't feel a thing. -Nita! I'm just saying. It's hard enough to support yourself. What are we talking about? Shut up. I'm still not sure what to do with it. With what? Chime in, why don't you? Maybe I can help. I'm going inside. -Where are you going? -None of your business. Come in! Hey, Wulan. Come in, take a seat. Just leave it open, we don't want any gossip. Have a seat. What is it? Can I help you? It's about my paycheck. Paycheck? What about it? May I have it early? When? Like, tomorrow? Tomorrow? Look, Wulan. All paychecks, must comply to the company's system. What do you need it for, anyway? I need it for something. To buy make-up stuff, right? You can use cash advance for that in alley nine. No, not that. Hey, where are you going? Sit down. I didn't say I wouldn't help. If you need money, you don't have to change the company's rules. What do you mean? I mean we could help each other. You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours. I don't understand. It's up to you how it's done. Up to you. You can use your hand. Or your mouth, even better. Whatever works for you. -No. -Where are you going? Fucking pervert. Hello, is this Wulan? Yes, speaking. I'm a Mother's Companion from the Expecting Mothers' Support Group. I was informed that you are in need of a counseling service? Right. But now, I can't… Don't worry. This service is free. Before we start, I'd like to confirm some things. You're now 16 weeks in, correct? Yes, but I can't talk now. So the child is due in September, correct? -Correct. -I see. I got to go. Hello. Mom? Sorry for being rude earlier. It's okay, we understand. Sometimes we call at the wrong time. Can we help you? I just need to talk. Alright, what do you want to talk about? Mom? But you won't tell anyone about it? Of course. I'm 16 weeks into my pregnancy. The jerk who got me pregnant is washing his hands clean. I don't know what to do. Alright. We could offer you three options. First, we provide you with counseling until the little one arrives. Second, we help you prepare a safe abortion. And the third one? We could put your child up for adoption. But, the process won't be easy and it will take a long time. I'll take the third one. Alright then. Stay healthy, Mom. Hi, online escort service? -It's the room across the alley. -I'm sorry. -I said… -Look. That old pervert Hardiman! But I like what you did. Why didn't you tell me? Well, knowing you. If I told you, I'd end up with more problems. Not less. "Needed Assistant to President Director at CV Cahaya Abadi." What kind of company? Electronics. Here are the requirements. "Attention to detail, hardworking, attractive, willing to work out of town." I'd just get groped again there. Why do they need "attention to detail" for that? -You want it? -No. You're not in a place to be picky. Remember, you have an 18-week-old fetus inside you. Wulan, your phone. The baby will be a handsome one. Right, honey? So, do you feel any discomfort? Morning sickness? Sometimes, ma'am. But you take vitamins regularly, right? I see. Not a problem. I'll buy them for you. Wulan. The support group told us all about your discomfort. If anything happens, just let us know, okay? My husband and I will gladly help. We actually hope you can stay with us until the baby's born. Wulan, once we hold the custody of the child, we don't want to separate the child from their mother. Feel free to visit anytime. I… I still can't give you an answer yet, sir, ma'am. But I will think about it. Thank you so much. It's okay. This is still an offer, anyway. Yes. SEHAT PHARMACY Been shopping, have we? I don't have the money yet. Can I crash here tonight? The landlord kicked me out. Wulan. Come join us! Come on! Fuck. Come on, Wulan! We're here. Wulan. Ma'am. Come inside. Your baby needs rest. Let my husband get your stuff. You and the baby need to rest. Come in, my dear. Don't be shy. Think of me as your own mother. Come on. Sorry I didn't pick you up myself. I was cooking a meal for you. You shouldn't have. It's my pleasure, dear. I don't want it to get dusty. My husband used to hunt, but it's illegal now. Wulan. This is your room. Nothing fancy, but I hope you'll like it here. Thank you so much, ma'am. We'll leave you for now. Do you like the scent? It's nice. Here's your towel and bathrobe. Excuse me. Hot water coming through. Warm bath for you, okay? It keeps you fresh. Don't forget to put the flower in. -My goodness, you don't have to. -It's okay. The flower will make you smell good. Careful with the hot water. I'll leave you for now. Ma'am, thank you. A house dress is good for pregnant women. Soothes your skin. -Okay? -Yes, ma'am. Here. Rub this Aster flower oil on your body before you sleep. It'll help you sleep well. Okay? Thank you. I'll leave you alone now. Wulan. I cooked this especially for you. You're pregnant, so you should eat more. You're eating for two now. Do your neighbors live far from here? Why? I think I saw something in the garden. It must be a neighbor. Sometimes they take firewood from here. I have a lot of plants. Lemongrass, bay leaf. I let them take some. It's fine. It's only the two of you in this big house? Yes. That's why we're really happy having you here. Your child will make this house more alive. Right, honey? Wulan, we don't have an old housemaid like in those horror movies. Wulan! Get out of the house! Honey! Don't worry. -Eat up, my dear. -Yes, ma'am. Take more. I still have plenty. -Help yourself, okay? -Yes. Is that shrimp paste chili sauce? We have shallot chili sauce, we have shrimp paste chili sauce. Have whatever you like. -Thank you, sir. -Do you like it? I like spicy food. -Hello? -Hello, Mom. How are you adjusting to the new place? I'm comfortable. Glad to hear that. So, you're getting along well with the adoptive parents? Yes. Then, may we end the search for adoptive parents? Sure, no problem. Okay, then. Stay healthy, Mom. Come on, it's fine. You're young, handsome, and successful. Girls would be all over you. Hello? What's wrong this time? No, I don't need it. Telemarketers. Hey. Come sit with us. So, did you get a good sleep? I did. My husband made some porridge for you. I'm eating alone? What about you two? We're full already. Special for you, Wulan. Thank you, sir. Delicious! The meat is different from what I usually have. What meat is this? Answer her, honey. A special meat, cooked in a special way. You're managing this huge property all by yourself? Well, this is an ancestral land, Wulan. If we don't manage it, who will? Honey! Bring Wulan in! She calls for you. I'd better go in, then. He's doing well, right? He is. We keep in touch by phone every day. Thank goodness. Yes. This is Wulan. This is the heartbeat. It's normal. The pregnancy is entering the second trimester. You should talk a lot with the baby. Read stories to him. And remember, take light walks for your health. Now you know how to make it, right? Yes, ma'am. So you can make it yourself from now on. Okay? Go ahead and drink it. Good, right? Honey! Can I ask you something? Why did you finally decide to give custody of your child to us? I… I just feel that you and your husband are different. Different? Your husband really loves you, and you also really love him. I'm sure my child will be showered with love. You don't respect me at all! I'm fed up with you! Now what? Fuck you! I wish for my child to have a better life than me. Here… Okay, honey. Boring, no pictures. "The Devil Market was one of the most feared and notorious bandits' hideout spots on the slope of Mount Merapi. Only the fiercest of bandits reside there. Now, almost all hideout spots got destroyed by Paksikaton. Many bandits seek refuge in the Devil Market. Crazy fool! Hahaha. Move! Hand over the valuables! I'm just a coachman. I have no valuables. Motherfucker! I'm talking about your master's valuables in your carriage, idiot! You're crazy, blind, and stupid! What did you say?" Ma'am. Hey, did you sleep well? I'm going for a walk, as the midwife told me to. Don't go too far, okay? Honey? Thank you for coming. Wulan. Let me introduce you to Mr. Ageng. Keep from all the plagues that come and go as well as all accidents. They come every ten years on Pungkasan Wednesday in Safar month, I give it to myself who do not understand so that I can face all of it. To be rescued of all salvation to keep my son, Bergas healthy. Wednesday. Wulan. What's wrong, dear? My husband and I are here to help you. But if you don't tell us anything, how can we help you? Right, honey? I… I'm scared. Why are you scared? I just want my baby to be safe. Yes. Yes, we all want that. That's why we asked Mr. Ageng to come here. Here. Mr. Ageng told me to give you this. He said you should wear this. Here. Please wear it. So you're both safe. Alright. Later, we'll check on the baby again. Now, you need to eat. Okay? It's for your health. Let me feed you. Prefer to eat by yourself? Thank you, ma'am. That's the baby. Everything's normal, no problem. So, there's nothing to worry about, right? Nothing, all is good. See? You're both safe. Relieved now? I'll leave you for a bit. Ma'am, mind if I go? Go ahead. Come on, relax. Ma'am. Yesterday, I was examined by… Mr. Ageng? How did you know? Because of that pin. After Mr. Ageng examined me, I started feeling… Mrs. Eva and Mr. Agus just want you and the baby to be healthy. Because they're old, they like to use traditional methods. So Miss Wulan, you don't have to worry. Don't be stressed out. Okay, Miss Wulan? Yes, ma'am. Hey! Wulan? Hello, Nita. -Where are you? -I'm at someone's house. Whose house? I knew them from Facebook. They're the people who'll adopt my kid. Fuck me. Are you nuts? You got knocked up by some guy from Facebook, now the adoptive parents are also from Facebook? I didn't have any choice, Nita. But now, I know I can't leave my child here. I know something's wrong. And I love my child, Nita. So, you want to raise your child on your own? I'm still not sure, but you can pick me up, right? I'm sending you the location right now. What location? Won't you come with me to the garden? Was that your friend on the phone? Yes, ma'am. Why didn't you invite her over? She's busy with her work. I'm sure she can take some days off. Have you shared our location? Did you give the address clearly? -I did, ma'am. -You did? My husband and I will be thrilled to have your friend over. It'll put a smile on your face. Right, honey? So beautiful. Look at that. Beautiful, right? But, no matter how beautiful flowers are, the smile of your own child is way more beautiful. Miss Nita? "Miss," you said? Don't you see this mustache? Look at who you're talking to! What is it? Chicken skewers. Who is it, babe? Chicken skewers! Did you order them? No, I didn't! She didn't order them. But it's paid. It's already been paid, he said. Wow, another secret admirer, huh? So? Alright, then. My luck for being so handsome. -Thank you, sir. -You're welcome. The police arrested three human organ traffickers in Jakarta today. So good! Want some, babe? -Feed me! -Okay, my baby. …several hospitals supported the illegal operation. The three men… -Quickly! -Okay, okay. The arrest took place on January 17, putting DD, Y, and H in custody. NO ENTRY They are arrested for violating the 2007 government law on Human Trafficking. Several victims admitted to having to sell their kidneys for financial reasons. One kidney is valued at USD 7,000. This human organ trade operation started in 2015, and has claimed 11 victims. The number you are… Damn you, Nita! Here, thank you. -You're welcome, sir. -Keep the change. Thank you, sir. Fuck. You guys look like newlyweds! Well, just spicing things up. Where's the picture with me in it? -Am I no one to you now? -It's there. It's in my room. Gosh, stupid me. When we were little, wounds like these should be sucked. Stops the blood right away. Okay. Come on. Oh, you're pregnant? I'll leave you be, then. Just leave this, I'll clean it up. Why didn't you tell me that there's a guest? I was surprised. Her name is Wulan. Stupid door! Shit. Why didn't you tell us you were coming? We could've picked you up at the airport. It's okay, Mom. I didn't want to bother you. No trouble at all, son. It's our resposibility as parents. My responsibility as a son is to love his parents. Are you on leave or something? I quit! I've stopped working for about a month. Why? Son. You always say you're okay whenever we ask you. Tell us if there's any problem, maybe we can help. -Your father knows people. -Honey. I came home to forget about my bad luck there. It's a long story. If I'd told you, how can I forget them? Oh shit! Fuck! Shit, they're broke, too. Fuck! Fuck! Goddamnit! Fuck! Fuckin' fuck! This is what I've missed the most. My mom's cooking, the best. She's the best. Your dad's cooking is also good. Really? Hey, have we met before? Are you a relative of mom or dad? Just let Wulan eat first. Okay? Eat up, dear. -Bergas. -Yes? -Did you do some running? -Yes. How far? I didn't count, Dad. Maybe as far as the size of this land. How much is that? This is really big. I'm just trying to have a healthy lung. Have you looked around here yet, Wulan? Wulan is pregnant, she can't walk around too far! -Bergas. -Yes? -Come. -Where to, Dad? Have a smoke. -What? -Honey? Better than him sneaking behind our backs. This way, I can keep an eye on him. You said you wanted have healthy lungs? Just one. Come on. Cigarette is very expensive in Singapore. -It's okay, Mom. -Come on. Excuse me. Let me do it, ma'am. No, I'll do it. It's okay, ma'am. I'll do it so you can talk with your son. -Okay. -Let me do it. Okay. Fuck! Where do they keep the money? What happened to your hand? -I fell. -How? Just my luck, I guess. Gosh, let me see. Go get the Aster oil in the wardrobe. Next to it. By the way, where is Wulan from? She's my friend's niece. No one's taking care of the poor girl. But she'll only be here until she gives birth. Like Sumiati our maid back then? Pretty much. How is her child? Must be big now. Do you know how she's doing? That hurts! I'm sorry, don't startle me. Honey. Where did you put my coffee beans? Honey. That's why you should put things where they belong. Such a hassle. I'm not finished with you. I'm going to the storeroom. Come with me, honey. -Wait, Bergas. -Okay. Man up! Life! Sometimes up, sometimes down. Gosh. Mom! It's starting to hurt! Mom! Wulan. Whether or not my parents will hear about this depends on your honesty. I need money to get out of here. Why didn't you just say you need money? This amount of money is nothing for my family. If only you knew what I feel. What I've seen and experienced here. You'd understand why I chose to leave without saying anything to your parents. If you really want to get out of here, I suggest you talk to them. I'll pretend this never happened. I heard your conversation with Mrs. Eva earlier. You were eavesdropping? Your mom is the one lying to you. Not me! What do you mean? Figure it out yourself! Aren't you smart? But just so you know, everything I do, is all because… Fuck! Here's your coffee. Thank you. Honey, I'm worried. I don't want Bergas to know. Bergas coming home is out of our control. Maybe he's meant to find out. But I'm sure Bergas won't accept it. He doesn't have to accept it. He just has to be grateful. Honey. We won't live forever. Sooner or later, he'll have to do this all by himself. Is it almost done? I just have to paint it red. Isn't it pretty? -Ma'am. -Yes? What's wrong, dear? About the adoption… What about it? I changed my mind. Why so suddenly, dear? You've been really kind to me. I don't want to bother you further. Wulan. You're not troubling anyone, dear. I want to try raising my own child, ma'am. Well… If that's what you want, I won't force you. You came here on your free will. And that's the way you're leaving, too. Even though it's hard, I'll respect that. Thank you, ma'am. But can I ask, that you stay here for a little longer, until you give birth? I really want to see your baby. Must be cute. Okay? Just a little longer. Okay. Listen to me, listen to me. We're finished, it's all over. You cheated on me and I'm good. I'm okay. I'm happy like this. Just wanna say I'm sorry and thanks for the good memories. Bye, bye. Fuck. I'm sorry for coming here without permission. I've been thinking of what you said yesterday. This isn't the first time I feel like my parents are hiding something from me. So, tell me. Who are you actually? How do you know my parents? I'm nobody. I met your mom on an FB group. FB? Do you mean Facebook? Yes. Seriously? Yes. Fuck! My mom has Facebook. What's wrong with it? Should I be worried? -Hey! -Hey! Wait, let me think, I'm thinking! Remember. Whatever it is, I promise I'm going to make you safe, okay? Stop speaking English, you douche! Okay. Oh, you're pregnant? But she'll only be here until she gives birth. Like Sumiati our maid back then? How is her child? Fire! Fire! Don't worry, Superman is here. He'll put the fire out! He blows and the fire's out! Mr. Bergas, don't mess with the tree. I'm not messing with it. I just want to write my name. Sum, when you give birth, what will you name your child? When I give birth, I'll name him Bergas. Let's go home, your mom must be looking for you. -Give that to me. -Okay. When I had my tenth birthday, I remember mom's maid, Sumiati. She was pregnant. 10 years ago, on my 20th birthday, there was Dad's relative, Vina. She was pregnant, too. Once or twice, I thought it was a coincidence. I'm turning 30 tomorrow. Those pregnant women… What are they for? Where are they now? I knew something's fishy. Okay. Come with me tonight. Where to? Just come. I'm afraid of the dark. What's this place? Dad's storeroom. Wait, I'll get the key. SPELLS Wulan! Check this out. -Bergas. -Yes? -Bergas! -What? Someone's here. -Bergas. -Yes? The wheelchair is still out there. Shit! I thought you were smart. Fuck! Where's Wulan? I'm alone, Dad. Go home. Since when you're not scared of going out at night alone? What were you doing outside at this hour? We wanted to… I was the one who invited Bergas out, sir. Yes, Dad. Because… It's been a while… so I invited… Bergas out to… have sex. Fine, go to your rooms now. Get some rest. Don't disappoint me again. WEKASAN WEDNESDAY RITUAL WEKASAN WEDNESDAY INCANTATION HEALTH INDICATOR REPORT FOR MOM AND BABY NAME: SUMIATI Does this house have no key, or… You trust me, right? Well, the last time I trusted a man… Right. Listen to me. You have to leave, now. Come on! -What's wrong? -I'll explain to you later. Fuck! There has to be a secret button somewhere. Come on. That's right, that's right, make sense. Fuck. -Honey! -Yes? Why is this happening? Whatever is happening, you have to be quick. Bergas! Be careful, Bergas! Let me. Come on. Sorry, are you all right? Come on. Stop. I'm tired. Keep walking. Enough rest. Explain to me first! What's happening? I've seen what my parents have been doing, but I can't tell you now. We have to look for a safe place. Explain! Those pregnant women, you, are sacrifices! To be sacrificed! Sacrifices for what? Read this. What is this? Bergas! How's your family doing? They're fine. Last week, my eldest just graduated with a Master's degree in law. -Law? -Yes. My second child, is writing her thesis on philosopy. I'm so proud. They both can finish their education. And then I'll see how my youngest will do. What about you? I was thinking, if I die, who will take care of Bergas? Oh my gosh! Don't think too far ahead. Don't worry. Leave it to me. I'll take care of things later. Yeah. That is, if I'm the one who dies first. What if you go first? -Then what? -Silly goose. INCANTATION What's the outside world like, Dad? It's huge, and full of mysteries. Try it. You smoke, don't you? The thing I've always liked, the most, is when, we're smoking together. Those moments make me happy. And the thing, I've always hated, is when you make your mom worried. Bergas. I hope you understand, that your mom and I, are willing to commit all the sins in the world… for you. How do you think you survive this far? Every ten years, there's always an accident that put your life in danger. Do you really think they were coincidences? Since you were born, you've been cursed. I'm happy for you, Agus. Thank you. When was he born? It's been exactly a month. Right, you were helped by your pretty friend. So you're the one who helped with the delivery? Don't give me that smile. His magic is really strong. Don't believe it! What day was he born? "Wekasan Wednesday". The most cursed day, out of all cursed days. Everyone would do something to escape the curse. You were born, on that cursed day. They said, you wouldn't live past your tenth year. At first, I didn't believe it. In this day and age, who believes in something like that? But then… ten years later, you fell sick. Fly away. Oh my gosh, Bergas! Bergas, wake up. Help! We've done everything we could medically, but there's no real progress. The disease you had made me believe, in what modern minds consider superstition. There's only one way to extend your life. A Wekasan Wednesday ritual. Keep from all the plagues that come and go as well as all accidents. They come every ten years on Pungkasan Wednesday in sapar month, I give it to myself who do not understand so that I can face all of it. When it comes to your children, there's no room for hesitation! The doctor's diagnosis was wrong! Your face got its color back, like nothing happened. Dad, help! It hurts! And those moments always come. Small unfortunate events, every now and then. Miss Vina, are you happy with the adoptive parents you got? Okay, Miss Vina, so we can end the search for adoptive parents? Thank you, Miss Vina. THE BALLAD OF ROY You did this for a myth, Dad! For some myth! Myth, Dad! Bergas. I've looked into it, it's not a myth, Bergas. You can pursue your education as far as you can, but never forget your roots. You just need to be a devoted child, let us sacrifice ourselves for you! Let us bear all the sins. Honey. Mom. It's just a myth, Mom. It's a myth. How can you believe in it? Mom, listen to me. You're my child. -I love you, Bergas. -Listen to me, Mom! Listen to me! Bergas. Mom! -Bergas, look at me. -Mom. Look at me, Bergas. Look at me. Calm down. It's okay. Take a deep breath. Come on. Yes, a little bit more. Just a little bit more. It's almost out. Come on. The baby. Fuck. Where's Wulan? You have to be grateful,. your mom and dad really love you. Stop! Son, don't do that. Bergas. Don't move. Bergas, this is for your life. I love you, son. Please, son. Son. Please don't. Give the baby to me, Mom. This is for your life, son. Mom, please help me this once. Please. Give the baby to Wulan. Wulan is the mother, not you… Just this once, I'm asking you. Dad, please! Bergas. Come on, take the baby. Nobody moves! Bergas, listen to me for once. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry, Dad. I've been such a burden to you both. No, son, I love you. I love you, too. But I'm sorry. I don't want to live if someone has to die for me. I don't want it! Please let me go. I just want you both to be happy. Please let me go. Please. Son. Don't. Please let me go, Mom. -I love you, Bergas. -I love you too, Mom. I love you too, Dad. Please let me go. This is what I have to do as a devoted child for you. -Bergas. -Please let me go. Bergas! Bergas, pull yourself together! Bergas, look at me, son. Bergas, let's go! -Bergas, let's go. -Bergas, look at me. Bergas, let's go. Bergas, you said you love me. -Bergas, go! -Son, look at me. Son! Bergas, come on! Here, drink this. Thank you. After this, let's find a clinic or a hospital. This is a song from Dad to Mom, when they first met. How will you pay for this? It's all taken care of. When can I play outside, Mom? Just wait. Subtitle translation by: Rizal Iwan
