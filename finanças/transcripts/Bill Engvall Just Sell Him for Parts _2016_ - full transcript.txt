When I was little, we moved a lot. And I wasn't a jock, so I guess to make friends, you became the funny guy. [country rock music] I think he's cute. And he's funny. Fall-out-of-your-chair, laughing, crying funny. Then I get to college and I listen to a couple of Steve Martin records and thought, "Well, that'd be a cool job." - He's real. - Master of his craft. - I love him. - Realistic. - I think he's hilarious. - Down to earth. - You could relate to him. - Therapy by laughter. If you like comedy, it don't get no better than this. People take their hard-earned money, and they have plenty of choices. And they chose to come see my show. That doesn't get lost on me. That's a real honor. It's like your sitting in the living room with a friend and just telling jokes. It's so comfortable and so entertaining. He's family-oriented, but at the same time, he's still just as funny as any other comedian I've ever seen. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Grammy-nominated and platinum recording artist Mr. Bill Engvall! [cheers and applause] [laughs] Wow. [cheers and applause continue] Thank you. Wow. Thank you very much. Thank you. It is wonderful to be back here in Rockford. [cheers and applause] Thank you for being here. Normally when I do shows like this, you know, I interview with the newspapers or the radio stations or whatever. And they always ask me the same question. They go, Well, Bill, is your family funny? [laughs] I always say, No. No, my family's crazy, and that makes me funny. And the Engvall clan has had crazy covered for a number of decades. My grandparents, when they were alive, God bless their hearts, my grandmother is just crazy as a loon. Most wonderful woman you'll ever meet in your life, but she just loved to talk. She talked to y'all, that mic stand, the stool, these walls. And they all lived in one little town in Texas. A little town called Georgetown, Texas. And my parents lived there and my sisters live there, and my grandparents lived there when they was alive. And Gail, my wife, and I, we both went to college in that little town. So when I was in college, you know, I'd go over to grandma and grandpa's house, because it was a free good meal. And... that was the one thing I learned in college. And I'd go over there, and it'd be the same scenario every day. There'd be my granddad, sitting in his favorite chair with the newspaper up. My grandmother'd just be walking through the house, talking. And I'd egg it on. You know, I'd say, Well, how you doing today, grandma? She goes, Well, Billy, I'm doing all right, I guess. They're not shoveling dirt on top of me. I guess that's a good day. I said, What did you do today? She goes, Well, Bill, I went to the beauty shop today. I said, Oh, really. She goes, Oh, yes. And I saw Betsy there. And Betsy was getting herself a bouffant hairdo. Now, Bill, I don't know why she'd get a bouffant hairdo, because she's got a fat face. Well, yeah, you'd think a woman with a fat face would want that hair hanging all down in front of her face. But, no, she pulls it all on top of her head. So now she's got a big, fat bun of hair with those big, fat cheeks. I think she's lost her mind. [laughs] Oh, and did I tell you this? They bought a new car. They got a... she wanted a Chevy, but they talked her into a Ford. She wanted a black Chevy, but the dealer man said, Oh, ma'am, black shows up dirt too much. You need a brown car. So now, instead of a pretty black Chevy, she's got an ugly brown Ford with that fat-face bouffant hairdo. I think she's lost her mind. And my granddad would just go, "Mm-hm." I'll tell you a story about them. When they were getting ready to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary, my grandmother said to my granddad, she said, Ray, I want you to go to Macy's and get yourself a suit, because it's a big anniversary and I want you dressed up. And my granddad was like, I ain't wearing no damn suit. I never wore one, ain't gonna wear one now. Because you got to know who my granddad was. It was boots, overalls and no shirt, all right? Yeah, and that was church. Yeah. [laughs] But, you know, grandma ruled the house, so she got him to go get a suit and they had their anniversary. Well, everything was great. Well, unfortunately, about nine months later granddaddy passed away. And we were sitting at the funeral home, me and my grandmother. And the funeral director said to my grandmother, she said, Ma'am, what would you like Ray buried in? And my grandmother looked at me and said, Well, we bought him that suit. I guess we'll just bury him in that. And I remember thinking, this poor man can't catch a break dead. So we buried granddaddy, and after the funeral I was having coffee with my grandmother. And I said, Now grandma, listen to me. I said, People are going to start calling the house now, and they're going to ask for granddaddy. But they don't really want him. I said, They just want to make sure he's gone, and they're going to try and sell you some kind of scam to get in your stocks or your savings. I said, So do me a favor. When they call, you just tell them that granddaddy's in the garden, or he's gone into town, or he'll be back later and they can call back and talk to him then. And I said, Trust me, they won't call back. Well, I went on home. About a year later, I was back in town visiting my parents. I stopped by to see grandma. And we were sitting there having coffee. And she said, Well, honey, you were right. And I said, About what? She said, Those folks call all the time. I said, I told you they would. She said, This one fella, he called once a week for six weeks. I said, Well, what did he want? And she goes, Well, that's what I wanted to know. She said, So the next time he called, I said, Young man, you have called this house once a week for six weeks. Can I ask what this is about? And he said, Oh, yes, ma'am. He said, I'm sorry. He said, I'm from Macy's, and I was just calling to see how Ray's enjoying his suit. [laughs] And I started laughing. And I said, What did you say, grandma? And she goes, Well, I didn't want to lie to him, because the Lord don't like liars. So I just said, Well, young man, we can't get it off him. [laughs] And she wasn't lying. And I'll tell you what my dad told me on them. As they got older, you know, grandma and grandpa, they couldn't get out of the house much. So Dad put them on this group called Meals on Wheels, which is a wonderful organization that serves meals to senior citizens and the homebound. Well, as grandma got older, she started visiting people on other planets we didn't know existed. And one day their Meals on Wheels lunches was late. And my grandmother got so mad, she called 911 to complain. Wouldn't you have loved to have heard that phone conversation? 911, what's your emergency? Well, we're about to damn starve to death, that's what the damn emergency is. Ma'am, is there anybody dead there? There's going to be two dead people if we don't get some sandwiches real quick. Well, my father told me this story. Well, y'all, I'm a comedian. You cannot hand me a loaded gun like that and not think it's not going to go off at some point. Well, my grandparents passed away about 15 years ago. Well, one morning a couple of years back, I got up and I called my house. Remember, that's one little small town in Texas. And my mom answered the phone. And she goes, Hello? And I said, Mrs. Engvall? She said, Yes? I said, This is Sergeant Johnson with the Georgetown Police Department. She said, Oh, my God, is everything all right? And I said, Oh, yes, ma'am. I'm sorry. Everything is fine. I said, Listen, we're just clearing out our books for the end of the year, and we noticed that we had to send our emergency vehicles out to your mother-in-law's house, because she called 911 about their Meals on Wheels lunches being late. And my mother goes, You need to speak to my husband. I mean, she threw him right under the bus. There was no, "We're sorry, we'll make it okay." It's his mama, deal with him. And I said, Well, is he home? And she said, Well, yes, officer, he is. But he's in the shower. And I said, Well, ma'am, if you could get him, that'd be great. [laughs] And she goes, Well, all right. And she sets the phone down. Well, you know when folks set the phone down, you can still hear the conversation? And I hear my mother go, Bill, it's the police. They want to talk to you about your mother. And I hear my father yell from the shower, My mother's dead. And my sweet little mother, who never raised her voice, went: I know that. Get on the phone! Well, now I'm about to wet my pants... because I have a visual of my father dripping wet, holding the towel, going, Why are the damn police calling my house on Saturday morning about... my mother's been dead for 15 years! But, my friends, he got on that phone and he was nice as pie. He goes, Hello? And I'm trying to keep it together. And I said, Mr. Engvall? He said, Yes? I said, This is Sergeant Johnson with the Georgetown Police Department. He goes, Well, how are you today, officer? [laughs] I said, Well, I'm doing fine. Thank you for asking. He said, What can I do for you today? I said, Well, sir, I hate to bother you and your family on this beautiful Saturday. I said, But we're just clearing out our books for the end of the year, and we noticed we had to send emergency vehicles out to your mother's house, because she called 911 about their Meals on Wheels lunches being late. And he goes, Officer, that woman was crazy. This is his mom he's talking about. And I said, Well, sir, that may well be, but that's not our department. I said, Listen, we just got the issue of a little bit of fine, and we'll get out of your hair. He said, Well, what's the fine for? And I said, Well, sir, we had to send a fire truck and an ambulance out there, because we thought something was wrong. He said, Oh, yeah, I get that. He said, How much is the fine? I said, Well, that depends. He said, On what? And I said, Sir, do you remember what they had for lunch that day? And there was a pause. So I figure he's onto me. You know, he's going to go, Bill, shut up. And he goes, I'm sorry? And I said, Well, whatever they had for lunch that day will determine on how big or little the fine is. And he said, Well, I've never heard of that. And I said, Well, it's something new we're trying. [laughs] He said, Well, how's it work? And I said, Well, funny you should ask. I said, All right, sir. Let's say they had a bowl of soup for lunch. Well, that fine's only, like, $10. But if they had, like, a meat loaf sandwich... Sir, you ever done this? Your wife cooks you a meat loaf on a Monday night. Well, then that next day you cut you a cold slab of meat loaf with mustard, mayonnaise, pickles, lettuce, onions. He goes, Oh, I love them sandwiches. [laughs] I said, Well, that's going to be a little more money. Can you understand that? And he goes, Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Really? And this is an educated man. He's not some rube from the sticks. So I said, So if you could think what they had for lunch that day, we'll get this whole mess cleared up and you can go on with your weekend. He goes, Boy, I'm just trying to think, officer. He goes, I don't remember what they had for lunch that day. And I said, Well, maybe your wife knows. And he goes, Hey, good idea. He goes, Hey, Mary? What'd they have for lunch that day? And she goes, Hell, I don't know. That was 15 years ago. He said, Officer, we can't remember what they had for lunch that day. That was just too far back. I said, Boy, we really want to get this cleared up, sir. I said, Just think really hard. I mean, did they have a salad? Because, well, then that's only, like, $15. But if they had, like, a turkey sandwich... Now sir, you ever done this? Your wife cooks you Thanksgiving dinner; well, then that next day you take some of that turkey with some dressing and cranberry sauce. He goes, Oh, hell, that's my favorite sandwich of all. I said, Well, that's going to be a hell of a lot more money. He goes, I bet it is. And I'm not even disguising my voice. This is his only son speaking to him. So I said, So, sir, think really hard. What was it they had for lunch that day, and we'll get this whole thing cleared up, and you can go on with your weekend. He goes, Officer, I'm going to tell you right now. He goes, I can't remember what they had for lunch that day. That's just too far back. He goes, Let me do this. He said, Why don't I pay the larger of the amounts of fine, and that'll cover everything. And I said, Sir, I wish we had more folks like you in the world. But you can see how that'd screw up our books, right? And he goes, Oh, hell, yeah. I guess it would, wouldn't it? Yeah. I finally went, Dad, it's me. And he went, Go to hell! [laughs] [applause] And that's what scares me about getting older. You start having those thoughts, and you think they're normal. And that's why I try to do things, to keep my brain at least feeling young. And that's why I did that stupid "Dancing with the Stars." [cheers and applause] Thank you. So I go on the show, and I meet my little partner Emma. Emma Slater. Just this wonderful little British girl. She's 24 years old. Yeah, just a love. She's a doll. But just British as she could be. I mean, to the point that sometimes, she didn't understand our English. Like, every week we would do this thing called the song reveal. And that's where she'd tell me what dance we were going to do and what song we're going to dance to. And one week she goes, All right, Bill. She goes, This week, we're going to dance the tango, and we're dancing to "Beef, Burgers and Paradise" by Jimmy "Buffet." Damn, that sounds familiar. I said, Emma, do you mean "Cheeseburgers in Paradise" by Jimmy Buffett? And she goes, Well, why would they call it "buffett"? I said, What? And she goes, "Well, when you go out to eat, you don't go to a "buffett." You go to a buffet. And I said, Well, sweetheart, that's food. This is a human being. So we start our rehearsals. Well, the way the show works, for those of you who haven't watched it, the first week, everybody gets a bye. Everybody's safe. Well, after the first week, my son called me from college and said, Well, just wanted to say thanks. I said, What are you talking about? He goes, Well, you almost got your butt kicked. I said, How do you figure? Well, he works at a little pizza joint where he goes to college. Well, "Dancing with the Stars" is on Monday nights. Well, what else is on Monday night in the fall? Football. He said there was 30 frat guys, and they were drinking beer like it's their last day on earth. He's got "Dancing with the Stars" on the big screen TVs. And one of the frat guys goes, Hey, man, can you turn that mess off and put on football? And he said, Before I could stop my mouth, the words shot out: "Not till my dad's done dancing." [applause] Yeah, sorry about that one, boy. Well, then the next week, Bill Nye the Science Guy was on our show, and he hurt his knee, and he got eliminated. So I've been on two weeks and I'm thinking, great. I've been on as long as I thought I'd be on. This is great. You can kick me off now. Deer season starts in three weeks. I'll be there for opening day. Well, y'all kept voting. [laughs] And at first I was mad at you. But then I started enjoying it, because if you go back and watch the shows, every time they told me and Emma we were safe, they would cut to the judges, and they all had this look on their face like, How is he still here? By week five, I was begging to be off that show. I was literally like... You ever watch those animal shows on the National Geographic channel? And I was that wounded gazelle at the back of the herd that was just kind of limping along. And you're like, Oh, God, the cheetah's going to get him. He's going to get him! And I'd fall, and the cheetah'd run by. Damn it, where'd he go? You know... And at one point, the ABC executives came to me and they said, Bill, don't take this the wrong way, but we didn't know you had this many fans. [applause] To which I replied, well, apparently you've never dealt with rednecks, because... [cheers and applause] Well, the first big elimination came with... I believe her name was Christina Milian. And she and her partner Mark had just gotten the first 10 of the season. And that dance... we had to do this little dance called the quickstep. And the quickstep sucks. Basically... no, I ain't doing it no more. The quickstep is... if I said run from here to the airport as fast as you can, and while you're running, do some dance steps and we'll judge you on it. Well, me and Emma got, like, three 7s. Well, the way the show works: at the end of the show, all 12 couples are on the floor, and they tell each one of them they're safe till there's two couples left. One's staying, one's going. Out of the 13 weeks I was on that show, me and Emma were the last two couples 11. And one of those was a bye. So we're standing there, and it's so melodramatic. You know, they go... the lights go... And the music goes "Duh-duh-duh-duh." And the announcer goes, Bill and Emma, you got three 7s. Did your vans vote enough to keep you on? Duh-duh-duh-duh. Christina and Mark, you got the first 10 of the season. Did your vans vote enough to keep you on? I'm thinking, Great, we're done. The announcer goes, Bill and Emma, you're safe. What? So we move on, and we kept moving on. Well, then the next one was Sasha and Snooki. And in real life at that time, Sasha was my partner Emma's boyfriend. And so that week we had to do this dance called the jive. [laughs] I don't jive. And I think we got, like, three 6s. But Sasha and Snooki got, like, two 9s and an 8. So I thought, Awesome, we're done. So we're standing there at the end of the show, and Tom Bergeron, the host, walks in between us. And he goes, Well, Bill, I usually read the prompter at this point in the show, but you've done TV. Why don't you read it? And I said, Whatever. And I look in the camera. And they start rolling it up. And I go, Bill and Emma, you're safe. Oh, my God! Are you kidding me? Can we recount? Because I don't think that's right. It was so off the charts. I looked at my wife in the audience and I said, This is wrong. I go, I should be eliminated Deer season's coming up. And she's looking at me with this look like, Don't be an idiot. Just stand there. Oh, are you kidding me? She's digging this. Oh, every Monday she gets a new dress and she's on TV. She don't want me bailing on this. But I felt so bad for Snooki that I literally started to take two steps towards Tom Bergeron and say, Look, eliminate me. Let her go on. And as he's interviewing Snooki, he looks at me and he goes... I said, But this is wrong. And all of a sudden I feel somebody grabbing my shirt and pulling me back. And it's Val, the Russian guy. And he goes, Bill, this is about your journey. Don't interrupt it. What? Well, Snooki's crying because she just got eliminated. Emma's crying because her boyfriend just got eliminated. I'm crying because I'm missing deer season. And we kept going on. Well, now we're a week away from the finals, and we had to learn two dances in one week. We had to learn the cha-cha and we had to learn the Argentine tango. So Emma and I are in the dance rehearsal hall, and we're rehearsing the cha-cha. And of a sudden Emma goes, Bill, can you do a cartwheel? I said, Emma, I'm 58. Yes, I can do a cartwheel. [laughs] And I did one. And she goes, Oh, my God, this is brilliant. Bill, they'll love this. We'll do the move. We'll cha-cha in front of them. You do the cartwheel. They'll eat it up. And I'm doing it. I'm doing a cartwheel. And I'm getting... I'm really good at it. Then all of a sudden my brain and my mouth got together and went, Hey, hey, Emma, what if, instead of a cartwheel, what if I did a roundoff with a half twist? And she goes, Can you do one? And I said, Yes. And my brain went, No! But I did it. And then she goes, Oh, my God! I don't even know where I learned this stupid move. But I did it, and she goes, they're going to love this. So we're rehearsing this, and I'm doing the roundoff with the half twist. What's going on? Well, she goes, Let's do it one more time, then we'll go on to the Argentine tango. So we get to that move. I do the roundoff with the half twist. But this time when I land it, instead of landing with my knees bent, I landed with my knees locked. Yeah. And the bad knee went, Bye-bye! I went sideways and I hit the ground. And so I sit down. It kind of settled down. She goes, Let's just go on to the Argentine tango. It's slow and it won't hurt your knee. And I said, Great. I don't know if you know what the Argentine tango is, but it is literally just sex to music. Oh, it's just this rub and grind, and your face is like this. And I'm like, Oh, Christ. Well, this is going to be really awkward. I mean, she's 24. My wife's at every show. Okay, I'll do it for the sake of the show. [applause] Well, I'm a team player. So we start doing this dance. Well, Emma was always about this big trick. She wanted to do some big trick to impress the judges. So she goes, All right, Bill, here's what I want you to do. I want you to lay me down, pick me up, spin me out. I'll spin back in. You lift me up, push me out. I'll whip around your waist and you catch my legs. And I went, Okay! Yeah, you're going to die... because I don't know if you've noticed or not, but I'm not really good at this. She goes, Don't worry, I'll be there. I'm like, Okay, it's your life. So we get to that part, and I lay her down, pick her up, I spun her out, she spun back in, I lifted her up, I pushed her out, she whipped around my waist and I caught her legs. And I went, Oh, my God! I'm getting this! Oh, yeah! There's going to be Bill Engvall dance studios across the country. So we keep rehearsing this dance. She goes, All right, let's do it one more time, and we'll go home for the day. Because we've already been there, like, six hours. So we got to that point, and I laid her down, I picked her up, I spun her out, she spun back in, I lifted her up and I got her to right here. And her legs were pointed straight up. And I'm starting to get tired. And I let her slip that much. And then I took my step that I had to do, and she shifted away to whip around me. And when she did, I heard a noise come from my crotch... that was somewhere between a scream and a tear. I had torn my groin. Oh, I hit... and they're filming everything. I'm on the ground grabbing my crotch, rolling around, screaming. Emma learned a whole bunch of new American cuss words. And I have never felt pain like this in my life. In fact, fellas, if you've never torn your groin, allow me. Go home tonight, take out your hunting knife, and put it in a flame, and let it get glowing red-hot, and then just jab it right in your crotch. That's kind of what it feels like. They had to call Gail to come get me, because I couldn't even walk. This happened on a Friday. We're shooting the show on Monday. Saturday morning, I called little Emma and I said, Sweetheart, we're done. I said, I can't get out of bed. And she goes, I just want to make sure you're okay. And I said, I'm fine, baby, but there's no more dancing. And she goes, Well, I got to call the producers. I said, Well, do what you got to do. So she calls the producers. Well, then the producers called me and they said, Well, we'd like to bring our doctor over. Okay. He's a doctor of pain management. When I was in college, we called him Dr. Feelgood. Yeah. So Saturday morning I'm laying on my couch with an ice pack on my crotch. They show up with producers, a camera crew, this doctor. And he starts examining. He goes, Yeah, you tore your groin. I said, Yeah, I kind of figured I did. I guess we're done, huh? And he goes, No. What do you mean, no? He goes, I'm going to give you an injection. I said, You ain't sticking a needle anywhere near there. Yeah, right? I'm 58. I got enough issues with it as it is. I don't need a needle being jabbed around in there. No little pill's going to fix that. So he gives me an injection in my thigh, and the pain went, Bye-bye! Monday morning, it took me two hours to get ready for this stupid show. I was wrapped, strapped, taped, shaved, gelled. You name it. Wearing panty hose to hold it in place. And we somehow got through the cha-cha. And we got, like, two 6s and a 7. And then I don't know what happened. I don't know if I just had resigned myself to the fact that we were done and I didn't care anymore. But we went into the Argentine tango and we just drilled it. I mean, it was the highest score we ever got. We got, like, two 9s and an 8, I think. And so we're standing there at the end of the show, and I literally am standing like this, because I can't put weight on my leg. But this time, we're up against Val and Elizabeth. And they'd just gotten three 10s. A perfect score. So we're standing there like this. And the announcer goes, Bill and Emma, you've had below-average scores all... All right, do we have to keep bringing that up, really? It's like your kid going through high school, getting all Ds. And they go, at graduation, well, I don't know how he did it, but here's his diploma. And he said, Bill and Emma, you had two 7s and a 6 average score. Did your fans vote enough to keep you on? Duh-duh-duh-duh. Val and Elizabeth, you got three 10s. A perfect score. Did your fans vote enough to keep you on? And I whispered in Emma's ear, I said, Sweetheart, we're done. She goes, Yeah, I'm afraid so. And I said, Look, babe, we walk out of here with our heads held high. I said, We got further than we thought we'd get. We got further than anybody in the free world thought we'd get. So we walk out of here proud. And she goes, You know what? You're right. And we look in the camera and they go, Bill and Emma, you're in the finals. Oh, my God! What? Well... now I'm convinced Gail's involved in this. Well, yeah, she can't just kill me outright, because then she'd go to prison. But if she's paying y'all to vote and I have a heart attack and die on this stupid show, they'd just call it a tragic accident. Well, that night after we did the Argentine tango, my body was shot. I mean, I was shut down. This was me getting into bed. I literally went back up against the bed and then just lay down like a board, because that way nothing hurt. And we're in bed. And Gail said, Sweetheart, I got to tell you something. I said, What? And she goes, I am just so proud of you. She goes, I know this wasn't in your comfort zone, but you did it and you put your heart into it and you gave it 100%, and your fans saw a side of you they've never seen before. She goes, You should be really proud, and I'm really proud. I said, Thanks, sweetheart. And she turns off the bedside light. Like, a second later the light comes back on, and she goes, I got to say one more thing. I said, What? And she goes, You know that Argentine tango? And I said, Yeah? And she goes, That was frigging hot. And I know what she wants to do! And normally I'm all in, but I was like, All right, but you're on top, because I can't move. All right. Well, now we're in the finals. And Emma is out-of-her-mind giddy. She's like, Bill, this is the finals. This is my first year as a pro and we got to the finals. You got us to the finals. I said, No, I didn't. My sick fans did. And she goes, This is the big dance, Bill. This is the big dance. We can do whatever we want. I go, No, we can't. She goes, What do you mean? I go, Honey, I'm 58. I've got a torn groin, a pulled hamstring, a bad knee. We can't do whatever we want. And she goes, All right, well, I'll keep that in mind. I go, Please do. She goes, All right, here's what we're going to do. We're going to dance to "Raiders of the Lost Ark." And the way it's going to start is you're on the second-floor balcony, and you're going to swing in on a rope. And I'm like... You know what? At this point, why not? Why not? If I go off in an ambulance, it'll be big press. [laughs] Well, thank God, we finally got eliminated. And, by the way, I joke with you, but thank you for voting, because it was one of the funnest things I've ever done in my life. And do you want to hear the sick part? If they called me tonight and said, We need you for Monday, I'd go back. It was just that much fun. But after we got eliminated, and the show was over, my knee was just shot. I went to my orthopedic guy, and he said, I don't even know how you're standing. He said, There's nothing holding your knee together. And I said, Well, what are we going to do? And he goes, Well, we can inject it with this gel every six months, but that's not going to fix it. And I said, What's going to fix it? He said, You need a total knee replacement. So December 15th, I had a total knee replacement. Have you had one? Yeah. They're not fun. Obviously everything went great, because I'm standing in front of you right now. But... so I wake up in my hospital room, and my leg's in this machine and it's moving around. But something's weird. You ever had that feeling when you know something's off but you can't figure out what it is? And I'm flipping around in bed. And Gail goes, What's wrong with you? I go, I don't know. Something's weird. And I flipped this way, and something hits the inside of my thigh. And I went, Oh, my God. I have a catheter. I've never had a catheter before. And they hurt. And I said, Do I have a catheter in me? She goes, Yeah. And I said, How? Why? And she goes, Well, Bill, you were under sedation. They don't want you peeing the bed. And I said, Well, how long do I have to have this? She goes, They're coming to take it out today. And as if on cue the door opens, and in walks this 24-year-old brown-haired lady nurse named Christie. And Christie walks in and she goes, Hi, Mr. Engvall. Big fan. Not now. And she goes, I'm going to be the one removing your catheter. Oh, God! And I thought dancing with a 24-year-old was awkward. And then she goes, I have to tell you this. She goes, I've never actually done this before. What? Well, go practice on a dead guy! She goes, I understand it just feels like a little bit of pressure. And I'm thinking, Oh, God! That's what the prostate guy said. [laughs] She walks over to the bed, pulls the sheet down, lifts up my gown, looks down. Now, here, let me tell you this. I'm on every drug known to man right now, so I'm not real sure how I'm representing myself at this point in time. She looks under my gown, looks at me and says, Do you have pets? What? She said, Pets, do you have pets? I went... Yeah. And she goes, Me too. She goes, What kind of pets do you have? And I went... I got a dog. And she goes, I love dogs. She goes, What kind of dog do you have? And I said, Is there claw marks? Is there something I don't know about? Why are you... And I looked at Gail and I said, What is she doing? And she goes, Honey, she's just trying to relax you. I said, Well, I'm not relaxed! When a 24-year-old girl is looking at my junk, I don't want to talk about my Australian shepherd. And by the way, if you're a nurse and this is your practice, that's not relaxing. If you want to relax me, lift up my gown, look under it, and then look at me and go, Whoa! [cheers and applause] Now I'm relaxed. So she starts pulling this tube. Yeah. And apparently, it was touching the back of my skull, because she pulled for what seemed like an hour. And then I heard "pop." And she goes, All done. I'm like, Oh, God! Could this get any worse? She starts to leave, then she turns. She goes, Oh, one more thing. I said, What? She goes, I can't discharge you until you have a bowel movement. It just got worse. Because I'm on a little drug called Percocet. And if you've been on Percocet, you know there is no bowel movement. As a matter of fact, I looked it up. And "Percocet" is a Latin word. And the definition is, "we've shoved a cork in your butt and super-glued your cheeks together." I'm not kidding you. I nearly had an aneurysm just trying to fart. So... So a couple days goes by. And if you've ever been on Percocet, you know the moment I'm about to talk about. It's that moment you realize you can go to the bathroom, and it's the happiest day of your life. Right? But I can't just get out of bed, because my leg's in this machine and I can't walk yet. So I have to call the nurse's station. And so I go, ding. And the nurse goes, Yes, Mr. Engvall. Can I help you? And I said, Hi. Um... is Christie around? And she goes, Um, no, she's down the hall with another patient. What can I help you with? And I go... And I don't want to just say I got to go poop. And I'm a comedian. They know that. So I'm trying to be funny. So I go, Yeah, would you just tell her I need to drop some friends at the lake? And she said, You can't go to the lake. You haven't been discharged yet. I'm like... You know... just tell her the turtle's trying to get out of the pond. I don't know. And she goes, You can't have pets in the hospital. I'm like, Oh, my God! Are you really not getting this? So I finally said, No, just tell her I have to poop. And she goes, I'm sorry, you cut out. What did you say? No, I did not! I heard it through my door. All of a sudden I hear, Oh, Christie, it's Mr. Engvall. He has to poop. Oh, God! So Christie comes in all bubbly. So we're going to give it a try? Would you not be so bubbly about this? So she gets me out of bed and I get in my walker. And we get into the bathroom. And it's some kind of like circus bathroom. I mean, there's pipes and bars and a swing and a net and a guy selling popcorn. It was just like... And she gets me seated on the toilet, and she stands there. I'm like... I go, This ain't going to work if you're standing here. And she goes, I can't leave the room. I go, You've got to leave the room. And she goes, I can't, because you might fall off the toilet. And I go, Oh, God! I'm not going to fall off the toilet. I go, Just stand on the other side of the door, and if I think I'm going to fall, I'll give you a precursory, "Whoa, whoa, whoa!" And then you run in and save my life. She said, All right, but I have to leave the door cracked open. I'm like, Oh, God, whatever. Just go. Because I'm afraid this feeling is going to pass. As we said earlier, Percocet, there is no bowel movement. But what it does give you is explosive gas. And apparently I had the bathroom with the supersonic microphone in the toilet... because every time I passed gas I sound like the bombs at Normandy going... [imitates explosions] And every time she goes, Success? I'm like, Shut up! Finally, like, a BB dropped out. And I'm like, that counts! That counts, right there. So she leaves. A couple hours later another nurse comes in and goes, Okay, Mr. Engvall, it's time for you to go to therapy. The surgery doesn't hurt. The physical therapy will bring tears to your eyes. I never thought the words "exercise bike" would make me cry out loud, but it did. So they come and they get me. They get me out of bed, and I get in my walker. What am I, like, 90? And if you've ever watched anybody with a walker walk, it makes a very distinct noise. It goes... [imitates clicking and scraping] What I don't know is the wing of this hospital that I'm in, all they do is hip and knee replacement. So they get me out to the hallway to go to therapy, and I'm walking down the hall, and I'm hearing this: [imitates clicking and scraping] And I look behind me, and there's like 10 other old guys and their walkers. We're like a senior citizen train heading to physical therapy. So we go to therapy and we're coming back. And the nurse says, Look, gentlemen, if you don't want to go back to your hospital rooms, you can just sit here in the common area and visit. Nobody wants to go back to their hospital rooms. So we're all sitting around kind of a circle, and there's just this awkward silence. You know, we've all got our walkers by our chairs. And nobody's talking. And I hate that. So I thought, Well, I got to be the one to break this. But I don't know these guys. I don't know where they're from or what their story is. So I finally just look at the guy across and I go, Hey, man. What kind of tennis balls you got on your walker? And he goes... Wilsons. Good brand. Smooth ride. Yeah, they'll last a long time. So finally people start talking. Well, then naturally the conversation got to how did you end up here? And I swear to you as I am standing right here, the guy to my left goes, Well, I was in Vietnam. I was a pilot. A plane got shot down. I took some shrapnel to the knee, and it finally got so bad they had to replace it. The guy over here goes, I used to play for the Houston Oilers, and a 300-pound lineman took out my knee, and it finally got so arthritic they had to replace it. I'm like, Oh, God. And then one of them goes, What about you? I went, Oh, God. Well, boys, I hurt mine doing the cha-cha. [cheers and applause] There's no way to make that sound tough. You know, nobody's going to go, ooh. You keep adding on, it just gets worse. Yeah, thank God I had my leotards on, because I heard it go. And I finally get discharged. But if you want to know what my life is like in one moment, this is it. Gail comes and gets me, and they wheel me downstairs to the lobby, and they give me my crutches. And I'm just getting ready to leave. And I hear this: "Mr. Engvall." And I turn around. And on the second-floor balcony that looks over to the lobby, it's Christie, my nurse. And I said, Hey, Christie, I just want to say thanks for everything. You know, you guys treated me really well. And she goes, I forgot to tell you something. I said, What? And she went, Whoa. [cheers and applause] But you know what? If you've had a knee replacement, you know what I'm talking about. And I got to be honest with you. I was really proud of myself, because it was very painful. It was one of the most painful things I've ever been through in my life, and I got through it. And I was really proud of myself. And I said, You know, you just got through something that's probably the worst pain of your life. Two days later, I got a kidney stone. Turns out I was wrong. Oh, man. I would not wish this pain on the devil himself. 2:30 in the morning, I'm in an emergency room crying like a little girl, ripping holes in the sheets of the bed. Because if you've had one, you know what I'm talking about. It's like the most debilitating thing that you can go through. And I'm just like going, Aah! Aah! And this nurse goes, Well, now you know what it's like to go through childbirth. And I said through my tears, Well, then, ma'am, y'all are stupid. If this is what childbirth is like, there'd be no kids. And then they gave me a little shot of something called Dilaudid. [laughs] Why is this not in every candy section of every grocery store? My brother-in-law said, You went from crying like a little girl to all of a sudden going, so, what's your name? So I go to see my urologist. And he goes, Yeah, you got a kidney stone. I said, So what happens? I just pass it? And he goes, Well, normally, that's what would happen. He said, But Bill, you have a very small urethra. How do you even respond to that? I said, Well, you know what, doc? It's kind of cold in here. [laughs] He's like, Sir, that has nothing at all to do... There's three things in life a man never wants to hear. "You kiss like a dog." "You throw like a girl." And, "You have a very small urethra." So I said, Well, what's going to happen? He goes, Well, we're going to do this little procedure, where we're going to insert a tube... up through your wiener. There's four things in life... a man never wants to hear. And inserting a tube in your wiener is numero uno. He said, What we'll do is we'll put that tube up there, then we'll take the laser and we'll stick it up there and we'll blast the stone. And he said, You'll be sedated. And I said, Yes, I will. As a matter of fact, I want to be so sedated that I see that light and I want to walk into it, all right? So they do the procedure. They bring out the anesthesia. And I said, Did you get the stone? And he goes, Bill, I have never had this happen in my medical career. And I'm like... Please don't tell me you lost your wedding ring up there. He said no. He said, Your urethra is so small, we couldn't even get the laser up there to blast the stone. He said, Is this hereditary? I don't know! Me and Pops never had that chat. Well, son, you're 21. It's time you learn about the Engvall family curse. Oh, we've all had small urethras. In fact, your great-granddaddy Max Engvall, he toured with Ripley's Believe It or Not!, his was so small. So I said, So what happens now? And he goes, Well, we put a stent in there to spread your urethra. Leave it in there for two weeks. We'll go back in and get the stone. So for two weeks I have this stent. I go back in, they put me under. I come out and they go, We got the stone. And I said, Thank God. And he said, You can pull the stent out in a couple of days. I'm sorry, what? He said, Yeah, you can just pull the stent out. And I go, What am I paying you to do? That's like going to a restaurant and going, Yeah, I'll have the steak and lobster. And they go, Well, there's the kitchen. Go cook it. I said, Dude, I'm a comedian. I don't know how to pull a stent out. He goes, You will. And he leaves the room. And I look under the sheet. And without being too graphic, I have a thread... hanging out of my wiener. [applause] I don't even sew. And let me tell you something. When you have a thread hanging out of your ding-a-ling, it makes it pretty interesting to pee. Every time I'd pee it was like the fountains at the Bellagio Hotel. And Gail keep going, Bill, you're getting pee all over... I go, Well, I got a thread... hanging out of my ding-a-ling! Excuse me if the aim is a little off! So a couple days goes by, and the doctor calls. And he goes, I need you to pull the stent out today. I'm like, Oh, God. I go, Is this going to hurt? And he goes, No, no. He goes, Just take a couple Percocet, you'll be fine. Wait a minute, if it doesn't hurt, why am I taking two Percocet? He said, Well, I don't know what your pain threshold is. And I said, Then we're going to have four. So I eat my four Percocet. And I looked at Gail and I said, Baby, you're going to have to help me with this. And she goes, What? No. I go, What do you mean, no? What happened to our vows? You know, for better or worse. Sickness and health. What if I hurt you or damage it? I go, What else could be done to me at this point? And she goes, Well, I'm going to have to shotgun a couple beers. I'm like... Great. I'm on Percocet, you're drunk, and we're performing a medical procedure. This ought to be awesome. So she literally shotguns two beers in front of me and then goes, All right, let's do this. And I go, Not with that look on your face, ma'am. You slap a smile on that face, sister. So we go upstairs and I lay down on the bed, and she takes hold of the string and she goes, Oh, wait, I got an idea. And I said, What? And she goes, Why don't we tie the string to the doorknob. And I go... What? I go, This isn't a loose tooth! She starts pulling the string. I go, Stop, stop. This is just too weird. And she goes, Thank God. I need another beer. And, like, ran out of the room. "Stent" is a very small word. So I assumed this was a very small apparatus. Fourteen inches long. Yeah. I pulled this thing to the end of my length. I had to go back and get the rest of it. And finally it came out and I go, It's out. And I hear from the bathroom... [imitates beer can opening] Thank God! She said, You want me to bring the trash can? I said no. No, I'm going to hang this from my rearview mirror. And she said, Why? And I go, So the next time I'm having a bad day, I can look at that mirror and go, you know what? It could be worse. [laughs] [applause] And then two days later, I got shingles. [laughs] I'm scared to go to the doctor anymore. I'm afraid the doctor's going to look at Gail and go, Ma'am, just sell him for parts. It's just not worth it. And all this stuff, all this stuff we've talked about... The "Dancing with the Stars," my crazy genes in my family that I'm scared to hell is going to come back and haunt me. You know, the menopause that someone won't acknowledge. You know, we're praying to God my son finishes his 10-year plan this semester. It's just like, my God, son, just sit in class. Something will sink in, I swear to you. And then trying to get TV shows and trying to get this show ready to film. I've got so much stress in my life right now, I don't even sleep at night. I'm up till 4:30, 5:00 every morning, because my little pea-sized brain won't shut down. And, yes, I know. I finally went to my doctor and I said, Doc, you got to write me a prescription to help me sleep at night. And he goes, Oh, Bill, I don't like writing prescriptions for pills. They got bad side effects. I go, Dude, I'm drying here. He said, Bill, I never thought I'd say this in my medical career. He said, have you ever tried medical marijuana? And I said... [cheers and applause] I said, Doc, I've never even tried un-medical marijuana. I said, I'm not going to jail because I can't sleep. He goes, No, no, no. You're not going to go to jail. He said, Here in California, for medical reasons it's legal. He said, I'm going to write you this card, and I want you to take it to the dispensary down the road. And I said, What's a dispensary? He goes, It's like a drugstore. So I'm thinking, all right, it's like a Walgreens or a CVS, you know? People in lab coats with name tags. No, it's a pot store. I walk in this store, and there's five white guys with dreadlocks that want to hug me. All right? Have you ever walked into a bar, and the second you walk through the door your brain went, Ooh, wrong bar. That's what this was. I walk in, I looked around and went, Oh, hell, no. And I turned to leave. And as I turned to leave, I hear this voice from behind me go, Well, hello, my friend. And I turn around, and there's this kid. And he goes, My name is Peace. I said, Well, Peace, I think I'm in the wrong place. And he goes, Well, what brought you here? And I go, Well, my doctor... He goes, Oh, so now you're smarter than your doctor. What? He goes, Well, your doctor sent you here, but apparently on the way over you found a cure for whatever it was. So aka... you're smarter than your doctor. And I remember thinking to myself, I'm being run circles around by a pothead. I should be quicker than this. And I go, Well, he gave me this card. And he goes, Oh... the key to the kingdom. He goes, Let me see your card. So I hand him my card and he goes, Oh, having little problems going nighty-night, are we? What am I, seven? Yeah, I guess. He goes, Well, turn around, my friend, and welcome to Shangri-la. And I turn around, and there is a full-on wall of jars of marijuana. And they all had names. But they weren't medical names. They were names like Bubba Kush, apey grapey, Cindy cinnamon. I'm in the Ben & Jerry's of pot. And he pulls this jar off the wall. And all I saw was the name "comatose." And he takes them out and puts it in a scale, weighs it, and puts it in a bag and staples it shut. And then he goes, Now you go home and enjoy. I had parked my car 50 feet from this pot store. This was me walking back to my car with this bag of marijuana. Yeah, well, I know the cops are right around the corner going, He's got the bag; take the shot, take the shot! I get to my car. I open the trunk. I take the spare tire out. I put the pot in the wheel well. I put the spare tire on top of that. A dead body, some lime and a tarp. I'm driving 15 miles an hour in a six-lane freeway with my blinker on 9 miles before my exit, because I don't want to raise any red flags. And the whole time I'm thinking, What have you done? You don't smoke pot. You don't even know how to smoke pot. And then the other side of brain goes, Everybody, shut up. Just shut up, shut up! Now, a roommate in college smoked pot, and he always had these papers called Zig-Zags. And he bought them at a convenience store. And I remember thinking, I don't remember having this many voices in my head. So I pull into this 7-Eleven. Y'all, I'm 58. You would have thought I was a 12-year-old boy trying to buy his very first "Hustler" magazine. I walk in the store. The clerk goes, What's up? I go, What's up with you, my brother? He goes... I don't know what came over me. He goes, What do you want? I go, I'll tell you what I want, my friend. I want a Slurpee, Slim Jims and Zig-Zags. And he goes, Dude, it's not illegal to buy papers. And I said, Was it that bad? And he went, Jesus! So I get my papers. I drive home. I run down to the basement, because I can't tell Gail about this. She's way anti-pot. She won't even let me go backstage at a Willie Nelson concert. Well, she goes to bed that night. I'm down in the basement. I got the pot, I got the papers. I'm like... Now what? Because I don't smoke, I've never rolled a cigarette. So I'm rolling what I think is a joint, and it ends up looking like a chewed-up toothpick. And I go, I can't smoke that. And all of a sudden I went, Oh, wait a minute. I got my granddaddy's pipes. My granddaddy was a pipe... You remember your grandpa's tray of five pipes? So I rummage through this closet. I find one of granddaddy's pipes. I put the pot in it. Then I stood up, and I'm looking right in the mirror. And I went, Oh, my God. I look like Ward Cleaver trying to get high right now. [laughs] This would have been a great episode. Ward puffing on that pipe. [smacks lips] [laughs] Hey, June. We named our kid Beaver! Okay, back to the basement. I lit this pot. I took one puff. Oh, my God. I coughed so hard, I thought my liver was going to jump out of my mouth. I woke Gail up two flights up. I'm in the basement going... [coughs] And Gail goes, Bill! I went... Where are you? She goes, Bill! I'm like, Damn it, how are you doing that? And she goes, Are you all right? And I'm like... Where's my Pink Floyd albums? I need to hear "Hey You" right now. And they don't tell you the weird stuff you think about when you're high. When you get high for the first time, there should be somebody there to help you. Like a shaman. You know, some Indian spirit. And he goes, Hey, man, relax. This is all real. I'm baked out of my gourd in our basement, and this thought pops in my head. Whoa, you're high... yet you're low. Well, I cannot deal with that right now. And the paranoia? Oh, my God. I just flushed the pot down the toilet. Yeah, I couldn't deal with it. And I called my doctor and I said, What the hell was that? He goes, What? And I go, Dude, I coughed so hard I thought you would have to replace my liver. And he goes, Oh, Bill, you don't smoke it. You eat it. And I said, What? He goes, They have these brownies. I said, Yeah, I saw those. He goes, Well, the pot's in the brownies. He goes, Go back and get a week's worth of brownies. So I go back to the pot store. There's Peace. What up? So, how'd it go? And I go, Well, to be honest, I coughed till I thought they were going to replace my liver. And he goes, Well, you know the old saying. What? He goes, You got to cough to get off. Well, that doesn't even make sense. And he goes, What are you doing back here? And I go, Well, I'm supposed to get some brownies. And he goes, Oh! Most excellent choice. So he goes and gets me my brownies. Well, y'all, these brownies are the size of postcards. And there's no dosage on them. They don't say, Hey, all you need is a corner. I go home, go down to the basement, I ate the whole brownie. And I was fine for 20 minutes. And then I didn't have a body. And I pretty much freaked out. I'm in my basement going, Oh, my God! I'm just a head on the floor in my basement! How am I going to get out of here? A head can't roll upstairs. Oh, God, and Gail's going to have to push me around in a baby stroller and go, Hi, this is my husband, Bill the Head. Well, yeah, he doesn't have a body, because he experimented with marijuana, didn't you? And I am freaking out. And I go, I got to calm down. I got to watch some TV. I turn on my TV. You don't think there's karma gods out there? What comes on? "Cops." Yeah. Yeah. And there's a police helicopter. It's right above my house. I can hear it. I'm going, Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I'm going to jail and I'm just a head. Who knows what kind of sick, disgusting things they'll do to a head in jail? Then I realized, it's not a police helicopter. It's our ceiling fan clicking around in our basement. And then the phone rang, and it was my mom. Oh, I don't care if you're 58 or you're 15. When you're high, the last voice you need to hear is your mother. How I answered the phone, I don't know. I'm just a head. And I said, Hello? And she goes, Hi, honey. It's Mom. I went, Oh, God. Hi, Mom. And she goes, What are you doing? I went, Nothing. Sure not doing marijuana. I go, What do you want, Mom? This really isn't a good time. She goes, Well, honey, I'm calling you from the hospital. And I said, What? She goes, Your father was having chest pains. I said, Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Is Dad having a heart attack? She goes, No, honey, relax. Jeez. The doctor just says he has acute angina. He has a what? He has acute angina. I go, Stop saying that, Mom! She goes, Saying what? I go, That my dad has a cute vagina! She goes, I think I have the wrong number. I go, I think you do! Well, now I'm completely freaked out. I'm like, Oh, my God! My father... has a vagina. Well, that explains the small urethra. There you go. I mean, my God! How did I even get here? Oh, my God. My mother has a wiener. My mother has a wiener! We're going to be on "Maury Povich." Oh, my God. No wonder we never went to the beach. And I must have been screaming all this out loud, because Gail came running down the stairs. She goes, What is wrong with you? I go, Well, pretty big bombshell today. I just found out my father... has a vagina. She goes, No, he doesn't. I said, Yes, he does! And apparently it's a cute one! I passed out. I woke up with the worst headache I've ever had in my life. Not from the marijuana, but because I slept on the floor for 17 hours. And when I... [laughs] when I finally came to, the first thing I did was go, Oh, thank God it's back. And then I called my dad. He really didn't understand the conversation. And I'm just in this fog. And all I want's a cup of coffee. And I stagger upstairs. And I walk in the kitchen, and I look up. And there's Gail lying on the breakfast table, drinking milk out of the carton, which she never does. I go, What are you doing? She goes, Where'd you get these brownies? They're delicious! Welcome to Shangri-la. You guys are awesome. I knew you would be. - We love you, Bill! - Thank you, buddy. I love y'all too, man. You guys... [cheers and applause] I got to tell you... when I started this silly business 35 years ago, I never thought it'd be this. I mean, I thought I'd do it for a year, maybe two. And y'all have stuck with me through 35 years of comedy. And God bless your hearts, you keep doing it. I appreciate that. And I love people that love to laugh. I love to laugh myself. As a matter of fact, people come up to me after the show and they go, Are you laughing at your own jokes? I'm like, Please. I've heard them. But what makes me laugh is if I tell you a joke and I see it hits somebody, they didn't see it coming. Or if you trip and fall. I'll help you up, but I'm going to laugh. Just know that. And I'll tell you what. Laughter will get you through some rough bumps in the road, man. A few years back I went home to see my dad, because his best friend had passed away and it just tore my old man up. You know, I'd never seen Dad like that. And as we're walking out of our house in the suits to go to the funeral, he's crying. And I'm trying to find the right words to make him feel better like I know he'd do for me. And just nothing's working, you know? And this is where I honestly believe this. That even in the darkest of times, if you're willing to look hard enough, the good Lord will give you a smile. That's right, about that second, my best friend from high school drives up. And he is an idiot. I love him to death, but he's dumber than a bag of rocks. And he hollers from his car, Engvall, you dirtbag! You didn't call me when you hit town, did you, Mr. Hollywood? Why you all dressed up, stupid? It ain't Sunday. Ha-ha! I said, Jimmy, we're going to Mr. Howard's funeral. And he goes, Oh, hell. Did he die? I said, No, but he ain't feeling good, so we're having a dress rehearsal. Here's your sign. [cheers and applause] [speaks indistinctly] [cheers and applause continue] I'll tell you what. Y'all have been great. I'm going to give you a few of my favorites over the past 35 years of doing this. [cheers and applause] And, unfortunately, my lovely bride holds position one and two. And she's not stupid, good God. She's the smartest person I ever met in my life. But some of the stuff that comes out of that woman's mouth. We decided we was going to get TiVo. So I went over to Best Buy to pick it up. It said on the box, installs in 30 minutes or less. [scoffs] Apparently they never met me. Eight hours later, I got this thing going. And I don't know how they do it, but it is amazing. Gail came down to the basement. Honey, this is crazy. I go, Watch this. I can pause live sports. And she goes, And they'll just wait? Mm-hmm. But if I leave it on too long, the commissioner calls me. Here's your sign. I was doing a show like this one time for a company, and they wanted it to be a surprise for the employees that I was the entertainment. So they flew me in the night before at this resort on their little puddle jumper airplane, which I was not thrilled about. And we flew in at night. And when we land on the runway at night, we hit a deer with our airplane. Oh, it whacked this deer. It broke the propeller. We skidded off the runway. And I laugh now because I'm alive, but I called Gail and I said, Sweetie, you're not going to believe this one. I go, We just hit a deer with our airplane. And she goes, Oh, no. And then there was a pause. And I could hear those little gears just grinding. And then she goes, Wait, were you on the ground? I said, Nope, Santa was making one last run. Here's your sign. [laughs] All right, all right, I'll fess up. I always make fun of other people. But I'll tell you one that happened to me. A couple of years back I had to get a vasectomy. And I'm sitting in the doctor... You know what just hit me? In the last two years, I've had more people touch my junk than Fred Sanford. That ain't right. Well, I'm sitting in this chair. I got my shirt on, but I'm naked from the waist down. My feet are up on these stirrups. Ladies, I don't know how you do it, I swear to God. And the doctor's down there just kind of... tugging on my sac. Awkward. [laughs] Well, I didn't know what else to do. So I just started whistling. It seemed right at the time! He's tugging away and I'm just... [whistles] All of a sudden this head... peeks up between my legs. I can't believe I'm telling you this. This head peeks up between my legs. And he goes, You trying to distract yourself? I said, No, I'm just so comfortable I forgot I wasn't alone. Here's your sign. God bless you guys. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause] [upbeat music]
