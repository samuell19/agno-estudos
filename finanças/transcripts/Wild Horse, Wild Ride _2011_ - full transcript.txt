How did you teach that horse to do that?" like the touch-on-the-neck stop.

I just wanted horses. When I was two years old and I looked outside our van window and just saw them and just how beautiful they were. Kris, if, like... if there"s, like, a horse whisperer out there, you know, he"d be it. He"s got that extra connection. Kristopher was at farrier school, and they had this little baby in a ring outside. She was six months old. And she was untouchable. She was wild. And he asked if he could go out and just play with the little horse. And the guy said, "no, she" s dangerous. She"ll rear up. She"ll strike you." And he went in the first night, and he was walking around with her, was petting her everywhere. And the guy that owned the school goes, "there"s no way." There"s no reason to abandon a horse if he needs help. I"m a slow learner and have a hard time reading. With a school, if that kid"s lost, he"s lost. And then he"s struggling and gets angry.

The whole point of the competition in its purest form is to be able to show that you can develop these types of partnerships. The secret is spending that time with the horse so that when something new happens, they"re not gonna wig out on us. Whoa. Oh, attaboy. Attaboy. Pbbt. It doesn"t have to be that old kind of cowboy mentality, where you have to treat the horse pretty rough. You know, you can get them to this point without touching a single spur, without kind of really forcing the horse into it. Attaboy. Whoa, bud. Good boy. Whoa. Good boy. ♪ I used to like to tell people, if they were to ask me, "why in the world would somebody live in saint jo?" And I would always tell them that, "well, there"s no red lights." There"s a post office, a gas station, and a bank. Uh, there"s not much goes on that... if you have to stand in line to do anything, we just don"t do it. And that makes for a pleasant life. George is a man"s man. He"s a cowboy. I know when we got together, he talked about, you know, meeting a lot of women that couldn"t deal with his lifestyle. We"ve been married for three years. I was 65, and you was 56. Mm-hmm. I"m one of eight siblings. Uh, all seven of the others met and married their lifetime mate when they were very young. And then I come along, and I guess it"s kind of like a schoolteacher that once said, "well, we" re gonna do it again and again and again till we get it right." You know, and I did it several times, and now, thankfully, I think I got it right. So if you don"t mind me asking, how many times have you been married? Well, she"s number seven. I told her, "you" re a riverboat gambler, "you know, to marry me. "You"re just straight out of your gourd." That... that kind of come across my mind too. And now, ladies and gentlemen... I think we"re a pretty good pair. I think if we"d have probably met a long time ago, could have kept him from having so many marriages. I just am amazed every day that I get up that"s it's... that she was there. And she was the person so much that I wanted. Everything about her was what I wanted. Nearly everything about her.

Attaboy. Come on. You are a hardheaded little sucker. Waylon"s a little... he"s a little outlaw, a fat, feisty little fella. Don"t you bite me. He is just nasty. He"s just got a nasty little disposition. Whoa, whoa. Sooner or later, me and him have got to have a "come to Jesus" on this biting thing. Attaboy. I expect instant gratification, and you just don"t get it doing this. Was that fun? Huh? Did you have fun? You have fun? Whoa. It"s hard, in 100 days, to get a horse to do what we got to get them to do, much less get one to do that that"s got that... that has the attitude that he had. He"s been a pill. He"s been a pill. Don"t you bite me. This horse may be untrainable. He may not have a gentle bone in his body. I"ve had a lot of worried time, because he... the horse has been hard to figure out. He"s been different than any other horses. And it is scary, "cause I don't want him to get hurt." Come on. One for the horse. My age, it always hurts when you hit the ground, but my doctor"s words to me recently were, "george, you are too long of tooth to be doing this." And I told him that, "well, when I get busted up, you put me back together, "and I" ll keep pulling up my saddle. As long as you can do your job, I "m gonna do mine." I think that"s as close as I"m gonna do to getting on him today. ♪ Yeah, I always say that, "now, a horse, you got to treat it like a woman." If you touch her in the wrong place, she"s gonna hit you. He"s a lot of horse, the way I see it. And if you try to push him too much, he don"t like it. My dad"s been spending time with him, been doing a lot of stuff with him. To actually earn his trust... he"s already got the trust, but my dad don"t have the trust on getting on him. Are you ready to get on him? Not really. I"m not worried about how many days I have left before I get on him or how many weeks I have left to get on. 60 more days, for me... 60 days is nothing. If I"m gonna get on, I"m gonna do it by myself. In case this old man gets bucked off, nobody"s gonna see it. I"m gonna make sure I clean the mess where I fell to, so I don"t leave no evidence. Living on the navajo reservation is tough. The job is scarce. The way of the living is hard. So the best thing to do is try to find a way to where you can support yourself. And carlos has come out to the point where he is making a living helping other people start their horses. And he"s been successful in that area. This is the first time he"s out. I"m getting him used to and familiar to his surroundings where he"s gonna be at most of the time. Following me anywhere I go. If a horse don"t know how to lead, I drag it down. A couple times back up and down... I"ve got a horse that"s leading. I just been around horses. Ever since the day I can get on, that"s all I do. When he was little, he always used to imitate training a horse or saddling up a horse. Usually, his horse was a couch or coffee table or something. When he was a little kid, one morning, he came up to me and says, "buy me a horse." So I got him a shetland pony. And I said, "okay, you take this rein. "You pull it, and you go this way. "You pull this. I go that way. "And if you get bucked off, climb back on. If I hear you crying, I sell the horse." So today, he"s still at it. In a way, what I have thought about when I was young, he"s doing it. Sometimes, it... brings tears. It"s hard to talk about him. It"s, um... it"s more joyful talking about him. And I am really proud of him. I want him to be out there somewhere, make a name for himself. Okay, we have to go get you ready for school, okay? - Yeah. - Can you say hi? - Hi. - What"s your name? - Ryker. - And how old are you, ryker? Four.

And then there"s the very private side that has a family, and, you know, I"m a mother, and I"m a single mom, which makes it even harder as it is. And... kensley, stop! Here, give it to me. There"s such a part of me that"s so different that... that"s a fun mom, a different mom. Not your every... average day, you know, soccer mom. No, my mom stands up on horses and drags tarps, and she shoots guns. And she... she"s a daredevil. And she"s this. You know, that, to me, is so much more fun than, "I make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches." ♪ Almost perfect. Come on. The buildup to this competition is so intense, you know. And you just don"t know. There"s a lot of pressure on us as trainers. Judges are looking for the showmanship part of it. So it"s important for us trainers to also look our very best, let alone the horses. And obviously, there"s a persona that I want to emulate. And I, you know... i want to be professional, and I want to look my best. I want my horse to look his best. And so therefore, you know, fake eyelashes and lipstick and whatever it takes. Even a push-up bra, I"ve even used that before. I like to turn heads. I"m not gonna lie. You know, what girl doesn"t? People go, "phew. Did you just see that? I did. And I liked it a lot." Okay. That"s what I like, you know, "holy bananas. Hold on to the monkeys. There"s gonna be a problem if we don"t slow down." Time to go to work. What I don"t know about this horse is, he"s totally unpredictable. There"s nothing about him that is in sync. Get it out of your system. I would just suspect a lot of people would give up on him. Waylon. Yeah, good boy, waylon. Good boy. You okay? Huh? You"re all right, waylon. Are you okay? - Easy. Easy, boy. Wait till I get him... away, and then you move out. - Easy, boy. - Come on.

But on the other hand, I know you got to move forward, or you won"t get them to where they got to be. Move it. I"m gonna believe that he"s going to smooth out and be a super good horse. I just believe he"s going to. You"re gonna make it. You"re gonna make it. Yeah, that"s a good boy, willie. Get you all brushed up. Good boy, willie. I have bonded with willie. It"s hard not to. A horse like him that... gosh. I come out in the morning, and he"s watching for me. And I walk out, and he comes up to me. A lot of it... i know he wants to eat. He loves to eat. Come on. George is... when I say, you know, uh, "that horse loves me." And his big thing was, "that horse don" t love you. "He tolerates you," you know? Come on. Come on, willie. I know she... - you"ll want to keep the horse. - I know. And I"m gonna have to keep telling you that the best thing we can do for those horses is, do the best job we can training them... yeah. And get them into people"s hands that will ride them. - He is right. I mean, he"s right. But I can just see my emotions... you take them in, and you taught them to trust you. You know, it"s kind of... and give them away. And then, you know, it"s like almost a mother. You know, and you"ve raised your child up, and then you"ve got to turn them out. Yeah. Good boy. I try to teach my horse, every day, something different. We have only 100 days. But your horse, they need to offer you what it can do. They"ve been having a very good relationship. And I think he"s doing excellent, not even great, excellent with that horse. All my preparation, all my training, is to see if that horse let me do all my rope trick on his back. Want to do a... to be nice circle and the horse is in the middle. I stand on him. And if he let me do that, I... I"m going to be proud of my horse. When I ride my horse, it"s something wonderful. You really breathe and feel love, you know. I get in touch with him. He"s a good friend, good buddy. I want to keep him. We don"t have a lot of money, but if we get him, be a good prize, you know. We"d like to bring him home. It"s amigo. This is your friend. You investing too much time in. I hate to give away, you know... somebody take away from me. Hello, amigo. Agh! Agh! ♪ Attaboy. You know, there"s so much emotion that goes in this. I mean, you think about when you pick them up, and then you"re training them. I mean, you"re just on this roller coaster of a ride. And it"s all the miles you drive, all the food you feed, all... you know, all the shoes and the... everything. I mean, all the... just this... you just do so much. And it"s all because we want to win. And hopefully, that would pay off. And so to win would just be like, "wow, it was all worth it." There"s nobody who's better in competition. I love competing. I love being in a really challenging situation "cause I thrive on that." There could be 50,000 people there and espn, and I"m, like, cool as a cucumber. I can memorize patterns, so if they came up to me and said, "you have to know this in five minutes and go do it," I could do it. I just like having all the pressure on me. I think you have to believe you"re worthy of winning it. My goal is to go bareback or bridleless. Okay. I think it would just amaze everybody. Well, the risk is, if you do it, you have to be perfect, because if you aren"t perfect, you won"t win. So you have to know, without a shadow of a doubt, the horse is gonna do everything you asked and that he"s going to perform well. And if you can walk, trot, canter without a bridle and without a saddle, that"s pretty impressive in 100 days. Wait. Let"s see if I can do it. Yes, good job, buddy. There"s a lot I expect from a horse. That was really good. And I don"t want to hear whiny excuses like, "I"m scared. I don"t want to do it. I"m fat. I'm lazy. I"m spoiled." I don"t want to hear that. What I want to hear is, "okay, we"re gonna do it. Let"s be a team." Keep going. Whoa, I"m gonna fall off. Let"s go wow the crowd. Let"s go make them go, "harold, did you just see that? "I think that girl just rode bareback without a bridle. "Somebody needs to post something about her. She "s special." Ow. You little shit. He slammed my foot. Hey, we"re not going that way. We"re going my way. He"s making forward progress, but it"s sort of like, you know, two steps forward, one step back, two steps forward, one step back. All right. Come on, buddy. We are going to calm down, right? You little shit. I want that behavior out of him before I"m on him. I"ve made the mistake of not. And then it"s me on the ground. You"re a monster. Dealing with horses is not if you get hurt... it"s when and how bad. A couple times, he got me off. One time, I landed on my head, but I was wearing a helmet. She hit her head hard. It was a perfect pitch. I mean, he stuck his front in. That back end went up. That english saddle popped her out. And she supermanned right over his ears. And her arms didn"t hit first. I mean, she landed on her head and then rolled on to her neck and shoulder and just sort of flipped. She got a heck of a concussion. - All right, we"re turning. We"re turning. I would really like to know what she honestly thinks about that horse"s performance. If she"s going to fort worth with delusions, then she"s not only setting her horse up for failure, but she"s gonna put herself and anyone who"s in the arena with her in danger. Left, left, left. No. Come on. Sweet Jesus. All right. We"re gonna do this. Yes. Thank god. Let"s do it again for good measure. All right. That was not good. Come on. We have fights. And he goes through kind of periods of, like... I don"t know. He"s really good. He"s really progressing. And then he"s just terrible for, like, a week. So I"m hoping that the competition happens during a good week. We work every day. And some days are great, and some days are horrible. Good boy. You know, he"s awesome. Having 100 days to learn... to learn everything that he"s learned is quite a feat. Kudos to him. ♪ Give him a minute in the dark, so he doesn"t know what"s happening. I"m gonna take away that element of sight. And I want to see how far I can push it to how far he can trust me. That"s a fence. That"s a fence. There you go. Nope, that"s another fence. That"ll be another fence. That"ll be a fence. It"s all communication, and if I tell him to turn right, that he"s trusting me enough that I"m not gonna turn him into a wall or into a ditch. Going downhill. Slow. Slow. Take it easy. Take it easy. Going this way. Just trust me. Trust me. Take it... take it easy. There we go. Okay. Okay. All right! Ask him anything, he"ll do it without any hesitation or any fight. It"s all right. Oop, uh, eh, eh. Eh, eh. You got it. You got this. There you go. You"re on the bridge. There you go. Coming to the edge. Coming... oh, hey. Not too fast. Coming to the edge. Slow. Slow. Where is it? Keep going. It"s right there. There you go. That boy, that horse, has made me the most happiest person on this earth. He"s just a good horse. That"s why he needs a good home. We don"t have the money. Don"t be thinking that all of a sudden, you know, we"re gonna become... how... how are we gonna take him through the winter? How... you know, you understand all of this before we get involved with this. And it"s tough. It"s still emotionally tough. But, um, this is something that they decided that they wanted to do. Whoo, jeez, it"s cold. Whoo! Come on. All that they know is what you"ve taught them. So it"s getting 'em to that point, and then having to say bye is kind of rough. Hey. And there"s no chance of keeping them, is there? Nope, which is kind of tough to say, but we"re not in the ability to be able to do that. - Why not? - Uh, money-wise. I guess, basically, the bottom line. So it"s not easy, but reality is the situation. They"ll go to a new place and kind of show people how awesome they are. So it"s kind of... gives you a bit of good feelings about it. But still, got to get a little selfish. Want to keep "em." But what can you do? ♪ It seems like I am way behind on everything. But the competition is about ten days away from now. And I haven"t even get on. Maybe I"m scared, to tell you the truth. Okay, comanche. I"m not gonna hurt you. Come on. When I was young, and when nobody was around to help me, I used to put them in a small pen and get on and try to move him around that small space. That"s the way I"m gonna do it. He"s got to know that I"m coming down on him. There"s gonna be weight on him. Don"t you try anything, comanche. It"s just me, your buddy, the person that feeds you every day. I"m scared, to tell you the truth. I think I have an extra spare of underwear somewhere. Phew! Whoo! I just want him to move a little bit. Take his time. Got to move up. There you go. It"s all you need. Okay, back up again. Some more. Come on. That"s good. Doing pretty good, comanche. Okay, turn. I only have ten days to work with this horse. Every minute counts, so I can"t get off. Only if my son was here. He always wanted to see me get on. Good boy. I"ve seen him take on different horses, but he actually wants to become best friends with this horse. I think he really loves this horse. Oh, boy. About three or four weeks into this, we were thinking he wasn"t gonna make it. He just wasn"t ever gonna calm down. But he finally did, and when he did, he just... he just became a good little horse. Good boy. I guess maybe we just found that peace with each other. And he settled in to me, and I settled in to him. And he has become the best-natured horse I believe I have ever worked with in over 50 years. - Good boy. - Hey. He side passed. - I know. - Oh, my gosh. Willie, we"re behind. It was real touching when you started to see them connect, "cause george had some, you know, choice names that he called him at first, when he was getting bitten and kicked and thrown into the dirt. Come here, waylon. You may not eat my hat. You may not eat my hat. Bonding with a horse is a strange phenomenon. Thank you. Thank you. You feel it more than you see it. And he"s just got me to the point where I know that this could be the horse that I"m gonna finish my riding days on. Seven weeks ago, no, I wouldn"t have thought that george would want to adopt this horse, because, number one, neither of us were bringing these two home. And I know he started thinking about wanting to bring him home. Didn"t really know what to say, "cause we'd already... you know, he doesn"t want me to bring mine home. But I can see... i can see that... george needs to bring that horse home. That little mustang"s got a lot of heart. That horse is... as small as he is, is big enough for george. ♪ Come on, willie. ♪ I feel fine about the competition. What I"m worried most about is losing my horse. At least we make it, huh? There are so many emotions right now, "cause I'm wanting to do well. I"m wanting to show willie well. But it"s also sad for me, "cause I know that I won't be bringing him home." And that"s... that"s hard. A few days ago, I don"t know what happened, but he started bucking. Tried so hard to stay in the saddle, but I got bucked off, and I haven"t got back on yet. Here, it"s just gonna be different. Either way, I"m gonna get on. He"s ready. He"s very calm, quiet. I think, you know, he will do a good job tomorrow. Now, you"re gonna come in right here. You"re gonna come here, keep loping, ride up. But you can do a drop-change transition, lope, walk, and right on into the box. Okay. Two circles to the right, walk out, and you"re done. - 100 trainers. 100 horses. 100 days. Quite amazing. Hip 74. Horse"s name is rembrandt. That"s art in motion. Charles has hand-trained comanche. One bobble, I mean, if you lead the horse up to the trailer and he"s supposed to jump in the trailer and he stalls out, you"re out. If you go to pick up his feet and he won"t give you his feet, you"re out. Serpentine through the cones at a trot and he doesn"t trot, you"re out. So there"s no room for any bobbles. The competition is that stiff. So nik"s gonna... walking along, and all of a sudden, his horse is down. Rolling. Everybody thought it was funny. I was horrified. So he just lost. I"m kind of hoping that they"re gonna look and say, "hey, you know, that"s a relaxed horse. You "ve done a good job," and, you know, give him kudos for that, as opposed to saying, "oh, no, no. We didn"t expect that to be happening." So we"ll see how it goes. Hip number 34. Walked to melissa kanzelberger, bryan, texas. If they can sense that you"re scared, they will take advantage of that. So I try to, like, push those kind of emotions away until we"re done. He could start bucking randomly, which he"s done. He could do the running out the shoulder thing, and I could totally miss an obstacle. I had no idea if I could do it or not, like, just absolutely no idea if I"d even get a halter on him. Actually, getting on his back seemed like a fairy tale dream. "- I was gettin" nervous. I felt like I was gonna throw up when she got on. She"s been proving people wrong from day one, so I was proud of her. That was good. You did good. Yeah, I just hope I can take him home with me. Hip number 9, evelyn gregory, saint jo, texas, riding willie. Well, she"s got her hands full with that horse. Yeah. Me too. This is just gonna be the sixth time I"m gonna get on right in here. - Oh, is that right? - Yup. You"ve only been riding him six times, wow. Hip number 11 coming into the arena. And this, ladies and gentlemen, will be his sixth ride. Right now, I can"t really push myself up into the saddle from the ground. So I hope he can stand still while I do that too. I just want to see how my dad"s gonna get on his horse. That"s all. I"ll give it to you, charles, and we"ll watch as you put number 6 on this horse. I"m scared for him, because, like I said, he"s getting old. He"s just trying to say that, "I"m still young enough to handle whatever you guys can throw at me." ♪ I"ve been seeing myself ride in the competition and have good communication with comanche and be a good team. The fear is always there. It never goes away. But after the competition, you know, you face it, you feel good. One of these days, I"m gonna say I was there. I did it. - That"ll do it. Six rides. Charles chee. I believe we"ll call this one six, seven, and eight. It was worth it. - Hip number 21. Kristopher kokal. - I"m not gonna lie. I"m feeling nervous. And I know my horse is gonna pull me through. And I just have to rely on him, and I know I"ll be fine. I love him more than love. He"s not even once just given me a bad eye or a bad ear. He"s just said, "okay, we"ll figure this out together." And that"s how we"ve come so far, very, very far in a very short time. It"s amazing what sioux and I came to be. Kristopher kokal. A boy named sioux. Awesome. Kris, you made it. Oh, yes. I pulled what I wanted to pull off. Wow. I did it. Chad, we"re gonna take can-do-it to be groomed, so y"all can relax. - Good work. - Thanks. Sweet. Just 100 days since this horse was in the wild. Ianny leach, tucson, arizona, and huckleberry. Some of the top trainers in the united states are there with their mustangs, and that"s really a challenge to you. But actually, to me, it"s an honor just to be able to go on the same floor with them. - Nice work down there. Very nice work. Clint bailey. Nice, nice. Time. And a good finish. Hip number 55. Entry george gregory. George is riding waylon. That day we brought him in, and we got him out and put him in his pen, and he had this terror in his eyes, and... but we didn"t give up. And waylon probably taught me more than any other horse ever. He, uh... he did teach me that... that... you know, patience will pay off. Well, if we could win, I... if we could win, we could show that an old fat guy can still ride a horse. If we make the finals, it would be a highlight. To win, it would just be incredible. Thank you, george. Entry number 52, carlos ray chee riding I don"t know. It"ll mean everything to me if I make the top ten... when I make the top ten. There"s not any native american indian, especially from the navajo reservation, that"s known out there in the united states. And I hope he gets out there and does it. One day, he"s gonna be out there. And I hope that I"ll still be out there with him. Carlos ray chee, from arizona, riding i.d.k. thank you, carlos. He"s gonna show his horse in the vaquero tradition. And this guy is one to watch. This is my favorite. Hip number 50. Jesus jaruegui. Well, I am a dreamer. And to me, it"s a dream, you know, to come to texas and compete. Now Jesus will do his course work. He"s been handling that rope since he was seven. Trained his first horse when he was 14. Jesus jaruegui, baileys harbor, wisconsin, on el compadre. - I know my horse. And I know what I have. It"s why we're here. If you"re that good, I come to compete with the good people. Wylene wilson from queen creek riding rembrandt. Better buckle up when extreme wylene rides into the arena. I know a few texas cowboys that were showed up by her, and they"re still trying to get over it. The gal has the eye of the tiger. Uh, and you know, she"s beautiful and flippant and crazy and fun and talks like this: And, "ah-ha-ha," and, "get it on," and then will go in and kick your ass. How would it feel to win... almost surreal, I would think. Unbelievable, but surreal. For me, I think, I"ve always been so close but just never won it. So if I really did win it, it would just be like... I"d do a backflip probably. That"s not an exaggeration. I probably would. Now in the arena, nikolas kokal. We"ve worked on everything that we need to. And I know he"s got everything, you know, from side passes to spins. So it"s just a matter of, you know, when we actually get out there, doing it. Nik kokal on ranahan. Well done, nik. My nerves were kind of out of control, just everything going on. I don"t know what happened. We"ll get the results here, hopefully, pretty soon. And, trainers, you"re gonna want to listen up. Here are your top ten finalists for tonight"s legends finals: Lots of chrome, bill lopez; Country boy and logan leach; Monte, travis dittmer; Huckleberry and lanny leach; Kidd cool, lorrie grover; Holaday"s richochet, miranda holaday.

That are your top ten finalists that you will see tonight in tonight"s legends finals that begins at 7:00. I would like to have made the finals, but we didn"t, and that"s okay. He"s a good horse. He wasn"t, but he is. And you"re still hoping to take him home, right? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. I was way at the bottom. I thought I was up there, but there was probably some stuff that I messed up on. And maybe next year, I"ll be a lot better here. This is everything up to this point. Wylene"s sitting first, lanny, then logan, then bill, then miranda. 76.50. - Really? Are you serious? How does that work? That"s okay. Like I said, we got to make choices, right? And we were here for the horse, not to teach a horse how to compete but how to be a partner, you know. So we claimed victory. So we"ll take it. Your best show. First of all, it"s a clean start. None of your previous scores count. You"re gonna get four minutes to set up and four minutes to perform. And you"re gonna be scored on the required maneuvers and on artistic, creative performance and overall athletic ability. ♪ Well, folks, welcome, welcome, to the finals performance of the 2009 extreme mustang makeover western stampede. Stinking boys, show "em what it's all about" when the blonde comes walking in there. Wildcat. Boom. From arizona. They"re gonna be like, "whoa!" I"m hoping so. I want them to be shaking in their boots, like, "ugh, not wylene wilson. Not her." It"s teryn muench and rainmaker. Teryn muench, he"ll definitely be a tough competitor.

But, you know, I need to... to prove myself I can do. Well, coming right along, this is el compadre, and he is shown by Jesus jaruegui. ♪ ♪ ♪ Yahoo! ♪ Jesus jaruegui. Thank you so much. The technical? 7.5, 7, 7, 7.5. Ooh, the judges agree too. Boo! Come on! That was horrible! But again, it"s all technical. I mean, you could be going around to the right, and the horse could, you know, be leaning to the left and switch a lead late. And the person in front of you does it perfectly, so that person that did it perfectly is gonna get a higher score than you are. It"s all about technical stuff. At least I"m done. Clint bailey. Clint is really good. He was second last year. He rode bridleless on his last horse. He did an amazing job with his horse. Clint bailey was stunning. And when he put the cow in the pen, and he took the bridle off, and that horse wanted to eat that cow. Go after, you know, watch it, move it, the crowd was screaming, because it epitomizes what these mustangs are capable of. Whoo! Well, the horse did his job. 9, 9.5, 10. Whoo! Whoo!
