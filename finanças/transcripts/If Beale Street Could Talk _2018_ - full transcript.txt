Fonny loved me too much. And that meant that there had never been any occasion for shame between us.

I've never seen her, I know only that an American-born Irishmn went to Puerto Rico six years ago and there met Victoria who was then 18. He married her and brought her to New York. Having pumped three children out of her, he left. Her home is on Orchard Stree. Orchard Street, if you know New York, is a very long way from Bank Street. Orchard Street is damn near in the East River, and Bank Street is practically in the Hudso. It is not possible to run from Orchard to Bank Street, particularly not with the police behind you. Yet Officer Bell swears he saw Fonny run from the scene of the crime. This is only possible if Officer Bell were off dut, for his beat is on the West Side, not the East. And yet, it is now up to the accused to prove, and pay for proving, the irregularity and improbability of this sequence of events. HAYWARD: I'm doing everything I can to get him back to you just as fast as I can. But Mrs. Rogers' refusal to reconsider her testimony has left us in a very tough place. - And now she's disappeared. - Disappeared? Well, how can she just disappear? I don't think she's gone very far. They certainly don't have the means for that. But her family may have returned her to Puerto Rico. In any case, in order to find her, I'll need special investigators and... - SHARON: That means more money. - Unfortunately. But doesn't it make it look bad for her case, for her to just disappear like that? She's the key witness. She's only one of the key witnesses in this case. You have to remember this Officer Bell. HAYWARD: His was the authoritative identification of the rapis. It's Bell who swears he saw Alonzo running away from the scene of the crime. If he saw Fonny run from the scene of the crime, then why did he have to wait and come and get him out of the house? Wait. Tish, Tish, wait... Let me get you straight now. You're sayin' that that Officer Bell tells her what to say. - Exactly. - TISH: So you're sayin'... There's no gettin' at the truth in this case? (SIGHS) Look. If I didn't believe in Alonzo's innocence, - I would never have taken this case. - Call him Fonny. Excuse me? Call him Fonny. When you call him Alonzo, I see the judge and the bars and the chains and the... I know you're doin' my sister a favor, and this is a very fancy law office, but if you're gonna do this, you gotta be family. So call him Fonny... please. I understand. Now, you and... Fonny insist that you were together in the room on Bank Street with an old friend, Daniel Carty. That's the alibi. But your testimony, as you can imagine, counts for nothing. And Daniel Carty has just been arrested by the DA's office, and I've not been allowed to see him. What they're doing is really against the law, but Daniel has a record. They obviously intend to make him change his testimony, and... (SCOFFS), I don't know this, but I'm willing to bet that that's why Mrs. Rogers has disappeared. So you see, I will do everything I can. (CRIES) SHARON: How soon do you need the money? (SOBBING) We're already tracing Mrs. Rogers. I'll just need the money... uh, as soon as you can get it. I'll also force the DA's office to allow me to see Daniel Carty, but they'll throw every conceivable obstacle in my way. (TISH SOBBING) SHARON: Don't you cry.
