COURSE I LOVE YOU. I MEAN, IT'S OK IF YOU DON'T. WOULDN'T BE HERE IF I DIDN'T. [SHOWER RUNS] LET ME GUESS. MY PARENTS SENT YOU. I'M GONNA TELL MY FATHER YOU WERE MANHANDLING ME, AND HE'S NOT GONNA BE HAPPY ABOUT IT. I FEEL LIKE SENDING UP A FLARE. OH! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? IT'S NO CONCERN OF YOURS. LOOK, PALLY, TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF HER. COME ON. HEY! UNH! [GROANS] AAH. YOU OUGHT TO TAKE LESSONS, PALLY. NOW LISTEN, SHE'S 17 YEARS OLD, I'M TAKING HER HOME.

OH, GOD, THEY'RE GONNA THROW ME IN JAIL! ARE THEY GONNA THROW ME IN JAIL IN MEXICO? COFFEE? NO, THANKS. CIGARETTE? I QUIT. ALL RIGHT, THEN, LET'S GET STARTED. IT'S OCTOBER 20, 1997, AT APPROXIMATELY 0127 HOURS. THIS IS A TAPE-RECORDED INTERVIEW BEING... Harry: MY NAME IS HARRY ROSS, AND HERE IS THE WAY MY LIFE HAS GONE. FIRST I WAS A COP, THEN A PRIVATE DETECTIVE, AND THEN A DRUNK. ALSO IN THERE SOMEWHERE A HUSBAND AND A FATHER. YOU'D THINK WITH ALL THAT THAT THE WORLD WOULD LOSE ITS POWER TO SEDUCE, BUT YOU'D BE WRONG. [SPLASHING] Woman: HARRY? YEAH? HONESTLY, HARRY. DID YOU SEE ME IN THE LAST REBEL? Harry: YEAH. AND YOU SAW ME IN THE END OF DESIRE. YEAH. THEN I THINK YOU'VE SEEN EVERYTHING OF ME THERE IS TO SEE. I ALSO REMEMBER A MOVIE YOUR HUSBAND MADE. HE SHOT 12 GUYS WITH A 6-SHOT REVOLVER. I AIN'T GONNA ARGUE WITH THAT KIND OF MARKSMANSHIP. WELL, IT'S SAFE TO TURN AROUND NOW. GOT A LIGHT? YEAH. I'M ALSO SHORT A CIGARETTE. [SNORTS] THANKS. WHAT'S YOUR RATION FOR THE DAY? 7. 8 YESTERDAY, 6 TOMORROW. HOW MANY SO FAR? 12. INCLUDING THIS ONE? THIS DOESN'T COUNT. IF YOU DON'T LIGHT IT YOURSELF, IT'S FREE. Man: HARRY? MY WIFE'S NEVER GONNA SLEEP WITH YOU ANYWAY. YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME UP AND PLAY CARDS. IF MY LAME-BRAIN HUSBAND ASKS YOU IF I AM STILL ANGRY WITH HIM, THE ANSWER'S YES. Harry: WHAT'S HE DONE NOW? OH, THE USUAL. BOUNCING CHECKS, MAKING WITHDRAWALS WITHOUT TELLING ME, NOT LISTENING TO HIS DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. IN SHORT, BEING JACK. IN SHORT...BEING JACK. [CARDS RIFFLING] ONE GAME. I GOTTA GO INTO TOWN AND GET THIS THING FIXED. HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU? $4,600,000. HOW MUCH? 4,500,000. AND CHANGE. HARRY, I DON'T MEAN TO BE CRITICAL, BUT PINK SHIRTS WITH LITTLE POLO PLAYERS ON THEM? IT WAS A GIFT. BEWARE OF THE PERSON WHO GAVE IT TO YOU. YOU GAVE IT TO ME. REALLY? ME? ARE YOU SURE? SAID YOU PICKED IT OUT YOURSELF. THANKS. BY THE WAY... HOW MUCH DO YOU GET THESE DAYS? NOT MUCH. NO. I MEAN FOR DETECTIVE WORK. I TOLD YOU I DON'T DO DETECTIVE WORK ANYMORE. I WANT YOU TO RUN AN ERRAND FOR ME. GIVE THIS TO A WOMAN NAMED GLORIA LAMAR. HERE'S THE ADDRESS. PUT IT IN HER HAND, OK? MM-HMM. I SUPPOSE YOU THINK IT'S BLACKMAIL, RIGHT? WELL, IT'S NOT. YOU SATISFIED? I HOPE THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE I'M NOT CARRYING A GUN THESE DAYS. NO, THERE WON'T BE A PROBLEM, HARRY. DON'T BE SUCH A WIMP. LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. IT'S A LOT LESS BOTHER THAN HAVING TO GO TO MEXICO. WHICH REMINDS ME. YOU NEVER PAID ME FOR THAT. YOU'RE LIVING HERE RENT-FREE. I'M WORKING HERE SALARY-FREE. DON'T WORRY. I'M KEEPING TRACK OF HOW MUCH I OWE YOU. THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME. [SNORTS] I GATHER YOU DON'T WANT CATHERINE TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. YOU GATHER RIGHT. GIN. DICK. "THERE'S NOTHING THAT CONCENTRATES THE MIND LIKE THE PROSPECT OF DEATH." SAMUEL JOHNSON. I'LL DO THE MATH, IF YOU DON'T MIND. IT'S OFFICIAL. I'M NO LONGER IN REMISSION. I'M TRYING TO COUNT HERE. DOCTORS ARE SUGGESTING SOMETHING THEY CALL AGGRESSIVE THERAPY. I HAVE, UH, RESPECTFULLY DECLINED. MY WIFE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME AT THE MOMENT. SHE SAYS I'M TAKING THE COWARD'S WAY OUT. I HAVE A YEAR, 10 MONTHS MAXIMUM. YOU OK ABOUT THIS? NO, AS A MATTER OF FACT. HANGING. WHAT? IT'S THE PROSPECT OF HANGING THAT CONCENTRATES THE MIND. YOU DON'T THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY IN AMERICA THAT WATCHES JEOPARDY, DO YOU? DID YOU EVER FIGURE OUT WHY THE DRYER OVERHEATED? IT DIDN'T OVERHEAT. IT CAUGHT FIRE. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. THE REASON IT CAUGHT FIRE WAS 'CAUSE NOBODY IN THIS HOUSE CLEANS OUT THE LINT TRAP. AND THIS DIDN'T HELP. YOU THINK YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THIS FAMILY, DON'T YOU? WELL, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE JUST THE HIRED HELP. HARRY, DO ME A FAVOR ON YOUR WAY BACK. WILL YOU STOP AT THE MARKET AND GET SOME BASIL? SURE. YOU DO KNOW WHAT THAT IS, DON'T YOU? THAT GREEN STUFF IN THE PRODUCE DEPARTMENT? MM-HMM. JACK IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE? DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IF HE WERE, WOULD YOU BE THERE FOR HIM? YOU BET. WHAT ABOUT ME? WOULD YOU BE THERE FOR ME? [SNORTS] WHAT DO YOU THINK? HMM. I THINK IT'S A DUMB QUESTION. GLORIA LAMAR! MISS LAMAR? [LABORED BREATHING] HEY. I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET GLORIA LAMAR HERE, AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO DELIVER A PACKAGE. UM-- [GASPING] [GASP] Harry: THE ONE THING YOU CAN COUNT ON IF YOU'RE A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR IS THAT ANY TIME A CLIENT SAYS, "YOU DON'T NEED TO CARRY A GUN," THAT'S WHEN YOU OUGHT TO BRING 2. THE GUY WAS DEAD ALL RIGHT, BUT BEFORE HE WAS DEAD, HE WAS A VERY SICK MAN. AS IT TURNS OUT, HIS NAME WAS LESTER IVAR. HE WAS A RETIRED COP. ANYWAY, I WENT TO THE ADDRESS ON HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE. IT WAS A RUN-DOWN JOINT CALLED THE SUN RISE COURT OVER IN MONTE VISTA. THE BACK DOOR WAS OPEN SO I LET MYSELF IN. OK, LESTER, TALK TO ME. ALL RIGHT! HANDS UP! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! INTERLACE YOUR FINGERS BEHIND YOUR HEAD AND SLOWLY WALK FORWARD. YES, SIR. TURN AROUND. DON'T MOVE. IT'S ALL RIGHT. HARRY? VERNA? IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. A REAL LONG TIME. CATALINA. [LAUGHS] CUFF HIM. JESUS CHRIST. WHAT'S THE MATTER? SEE THAT GUY OVER THERE WITH VERNA? Officer: YEAH? CARL. HEY, HARRY. THAT'S HARRY-FUCKING-ROSS. Officer: SO? WHAT'S YOUR WORST FEAR? GETTING SHOT. GETTING SHOT WHERE? INGLEWOOD? NOT THAT KIND OF WHERE. OH, SHIT. GOES DOWN TO MEXICO, LOOKING FOR THIS RUNAWAY KID. WHEN HE FINDS HER, SHE WON'T COME WITH HIM. SOMEHOW SHE GETS AHOLD OF THE DUMB SON OF A BITCH'S GUN, AND WHAMMO! SHOOTS HIM IN THE DICK? BLEW IT RIGHT OUT OF THE HANGAR IS WHAT I HEARD. CAPTAIN? YEAH. HARRY, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU. SINCE WHEN? HEY, SURE, WE'VE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES OVER THE YEARS, BUT TIME HEALS-- CAN WE GET STARTED? SURE. SURE. IF HARRY FEELS UP TO A FEW QUESTIONS. IF I FEEL UP TO A FEW QUESTIONS? I'M SURE HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM ANYBODY ELSE. I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. WELL, THEN... WHAT EXACTLY WHERE YOU DOING AT LESTER IVAR'S HOUSE? I WAS WAITING FOR LESTER. I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET HIM. WHY SHOULD I BE TREATED DIFFERENT? MY POINT EXACTLY. WHAT WAS YOUR BUSINESS? HE WAS DOING A SURVEILLANCE. HE WANTED ME TO TAKE THE NIGHT SHIFT. THAT'S ALL I KNOW. AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE? MISSING? NO. YOU WORK FOR LESTER OFTEN? NOW AND THEN. WHEN HIS ASTHMA KICKS UP, HE GIVES ME A CALL. ARE YOU AWARE LESTER IVAR WAS MURDERED TODAY? NO. I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. WELL, HERE'S THE THING, HARRY. ONE HALF HOUR AFTER LESTER IS KILLED AT A FLOPHOUSE OVER ON PALMETTO, WE FIND YOU IN HIS APARTMENT WHICH HAD BEEN RANSACKED. THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED AS BREAKING AND ENTERING. YOU SAY YOU WERE WORKING FOR LESTER, BUT YOU LET YOUR LICENSE EXPIRE A YEAR AGO. I BETTER CALL A LAWYER. RELAX. WE'RE NOT AFTER YOU. A MAN WITH HIS OWN CROSS TO BEAR. CROSS...TO BEAR? YOU THINK THAT I-- I THINK THAT'LL BE ALL FOR TONIGHT. IF THERE ARE ANY MORE QUESTIONS, WE CERTAINLY KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOU. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, CAPTAIN? SURE THING, LIEUTENANT. OK, WHAT'S GOING ON? NOTHING. NOTHING'S GOING ON. HEY. WHAT? WE WORKED TOGETHER, REMEMBER? WE WERE PARTNERS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. HARRY, CUT IT OUT. MY ASS. LOOK, NOBODY THINKS THAT YOU KILLED LESTER IVAR. THAT NEVER STOPPED YOU GUYS FROM REAMING MY ASS BEFORE. WELL, WE JUST CUT YOU A LITTLE SLACK THIS TIME, THAT'S ALL. A LITTLE SLACK? I LET MY GODDAMN LICENSE EXPIRE A YEAR AGO. ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED IN MEXICO. I TOOK A BULLET IN MEXICO. OH, HARRY, PLEASE. LIEUTENANT, CAN I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU? Verna: BE RIGHT THERE. HARRY, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING, AND... JUST KNOW... I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU. Raymond Hope: YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS, BUT BACK WHEN I WAS STILL A COP... HEY, HOTSHOT. I HAD BUT ONE AMBITION, AND THAT WAS TO GET INTO THE FAIR VERNA'S KNICKERS. NOT BEING ABLE TO DO SO WAS ONE OF A SERIES OF PROFESSIONAL DISAPPOINTMENTS THAT DROVE ME INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. PEOPLE TOLD ME YOU WERE MORE FORTUNATE. AH. YOU MUST BE CONFUSED, RAYMOND. OH, LORD, I DO HATE A MODEST MAN. CARE FOR A DRINK? I COULD USE A CUP OF COFFEE. IF WE HAVE TO. JACK AMES SEND YOU DOWN HERE TO LOOK AFTER ME? AH, THE COPS CALLED THE AMES HOUSE TO VERIFY YOUR ADDRESS. JACK WANTED ME TO COME DOWN, MAKE SURE THEY HADN'T ELECTROCUTED YOU YET. I APPRECIATE HIS CONFIDENCE. WANT SOME MILK OR SUGAR? NO, NOT FOR ME. YOU, UH, YOU WANT SOME THINNER? NO, THANKS. YOU KNOW, BACK WHEN I WAS WORKING SECURITY AT THE STUDIO, IT WAS A FULL-TIME JOB KEEPING JACK AMES OUT OF TROUBLE. NO, NO. DOCTOR'S ORDERS. IF THERE WAS AN ACTRESS HE MISSED BOINKING, I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS. YOU KNOW, THEY ALL LOVED HIM, EVEN AFTER HE DUMPED 'EM. I MEAN, THE MAN HAD THE GIFT. THEIR HUSBANDS TOOK A DIMMER VIEW, IF I REMEMBER. WELL, THEY WOULD. ESPECIALLY CATHERINE'S. BILLY SULLIVAN. YEAH, IT HURT POOR BILLY'S FEELINGS SO BAD, HE SWAM OUT TO SEA AND NEVER SWAM BACK. OF COURSE, HE ALSO LOST A BUNDLE OF MONEY GAMBLING ABOUT THE SAME TIME. YOU LOSE A WOMAN LIKE CATHERINE AND A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY IN THE SAME WEEK, YOU CAN BEGIN TO FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF. I CAN SEE HOW YOU MIGHT. NEVER HAVING HAD EITHER. I USED TO THINK THAT JACK AMES WAS ABOUT THE LUCKIEST MAN I'D EVER RUN ACROSS. LOOKS LIKE HE'S RUN OUT OF LUCK, THOUGH. CANCER'S WHAT I HEARD. WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE ALL RUN OUT OF LUCK IN THE END. YOUR PROSTATE STARTED ACTING UP? NOT YET. SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO. I GUESS I BETTER GET ON MY HORSE. THIS IS LATE FOR ME. SAD, AIN'T IT? YOU TELL THAT VERNA IF SHE EVER GETS THE URGE TO HUMP AN OLD MAN, SHE CAN HUMP ME. I'M IN THE BOOK. Both: UNDER "HUMP." [PIANO PLAYING] * THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU * * AND I FORGET TO DO * * THE LITTLE ORDINARY THINGS * * THAT EVERYONE OUGHT TO DO * * I'M LIVIN' IN * * A KIND OF DAYDREAM * ALL ALONE? I HAVE MY THOUGHTS. PISS-POOR COMPANY, THOUGH. THIS WAY IT DON'T COUNT. OH, HARRY, YOU'RE A PAL. [PATS SEAT] I WAS KIND OF HOPING TO TALK TO JACK. OH. AND HERE I THOUGHT IT WAS MY COMPANY. JACK TOOK A SEDATIVE AND WENT TO SLEEP. SOMETHING GOT HIM TERRIBLY UPSET THIS AFTERNOON. I HAVE AN IDEA THAT MAYBE YOU MIGHT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. RIGHT. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE HIRE YOU, BECAUSE YOU'RE MUTE. WHERE'S MEL? SHE CAME HOME FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES AND THEN WENT OUT TO WORK. SHE'S GOT A NIGHT-SHOOT ON A LOW-BUDGET FILM. SHE ASKED ME A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION. SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE HELL YOU'RE STILL LIVING HERE. WHAT'D YOU TELL HER? I WAS MUTE. DID YOU EVER HEAR OF A GUY BY THE NAME OF LESTER IVAR? NO. SOMEBODY KILLED HIM TODAY. I'M SORRY. WAS HE A FRIEND OF YOURS? NO. NEVER HEARD OF HIM, HUH? NO. YOU'RE LYING. YOU KNEW LESTER IVAR. YOU WERE AT HIS APARTMENT THIS AFTERNOON. FIND WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHAT'S THAT PERFUME YOU WEAR? THE REASON I ASK--IT WAS STILL IN THE AIR WHEN I GOT THERE. HARRY, A LOT OF WOMEN WEAR BAL Ã„ VERSAILLES. SMELLS DIFFERENT ON THEM. I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE HOW FAMILIAR YOU'VE BECOME WITH EVERYTHING IN THIS HOUSE. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT A GUY. I PISS YOU OFF, AND YOU'RE OUT OF HERE IN THE TIME IT TAKES TO PACK ONE BAG. MY HUSBAND WOULD NEED A COUPLE OF VANS, MAYBE A WHOLE ARMY OF MOVERS, AND IT'D STILL TAKE HIM 2 WEEKS. GOT A LIGHT? THANKS. THE THING IS, WE'RE BROKE. NO. I'M BROKE. YOU AND JACK ARE OVEREXTENDED. I'LL EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE TO YOU SOMETIME SO YOU'LL UNDERSTAND. THE THING IS, WE'RE BROKE, AND MY HUSBAND'S DYING. AND I THOUGHT THAT I COULD... GUT IT OUT, YOU KNOW? KIND OF HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER THE WAY... SO THAT THERE'D BE ENOUGH TIME. SO THAT HE COULD... DIE IN PEACE, BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S GONNA HAPPEN. GOD... DAMN FUCKING THING. GODDAMN FUCKING... HERE. LET ME-- NO. OK, GO. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'VE BEEN STICKING AROUND SO LONG FOR ANYWAY. YOU DON'T? DON'T FORGET YOUR LIGHTER. Catherine: I REMEMBER THE FIRST MORNING THAT I MET YOU. I OPENED THE DOOR, AND THERE YOU STOOD IN AN OLD BLUE SHIRT WITH A FRAYED COLLAR, AND... WHOEVER CUT YOUR HAIR FORGOT ABOUT THIS LITTLE PART RIGHT THERE. I BET YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER. WELL... IN THE FIRST PLACE, IT WASN'T MORNING. IT WAS AFTERNOON. THE MAID ANSWERED THE DOOR. AND YOU AND JACK WERE HAVING LUNCH BY THE SWIMMING POOL. HE GAVE ME A PICTURE OF MEL. AND I DON'T... EVEN THINK YOU SAID HELLO. I SUPPOSE YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME YOU DON'T OWN ANY BLUE SHIRTS. NO, I GOT A BUNCH OF THOSE. I KNOW. I REMEMBER. Jack over intercom: HARRY! HARRY, I CAN'T BREATHE! I CAN'T FIND CATH. HELP ME! JACK! JACK. JACK! JACK. OH, JACK. JACK. JACK. LIVE, YOU SON OF A BITCH. [COUGHS] YES. [COUGHING] CATH, I TRIED TO CALL YOU. I KNOW. Harry: I GOT 911. DON'T TALK. HERE'S THE TANK. HARRY. HARRY. YOU'RE A PAL. OHH! AAH! SON OF A BITCH! GET OUT, HARRY. JUST GET OUT. GO! CATH, HOW COULD YOU? HOW FUCKING COULD YOU? OHH! WATCH THE WALLS, GUYS. OK. Paramedic: COMIN' UP ON THE STAIRS, JOE. DADDY! SWEETIE, CALL DR. HAYES. TELL HIM WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO CEDARS. WHAT HAPPENED? MEL, YOU'RE IN THE WAY. EXCUSE ME, MISS. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] HELLO. Gloria: MR. AMES? UH, HE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW. WHEN DO YOU EXPECT HIM? I CAN'T SAY. THIS... WOULDN'T BE GLORIA LAMAR, WOULD IT? THE REASON I ASK IS THAT MR. AMES GAVE ME A PACKAGE TO GIVE TO HER. WELL, THAT WOULD MAKE YOU ROSS. RIGHT. MR. AMES IS ANXIOUS THAT MISS LAMAR GET THIS ENVELOPE. IS THERE SOMEPLACE WE CAN MEET WHERE I CAN GIVE IT TO HER? YOU KNOW THE SANTA MONICA PIER? YEAH. ONE HOUR FROM NOW AT THE WATER PISTOL RANGE. HOW WILL I KNOW WHO YOU ARE? BLONDE, BIG. MUCHO HAIR, MUCHO TITS. [DIAL TONE] I CAN'T WAIT. A BUCK, HUH? YEAH. WANNA TRY YOUR LUCK? [DING] YOUR NAME WOULDN'T BE ROSS, WOULD IT? RIGHT THE FIRST GUESS. A WOMAN CALLED EARLIER, TOLD ME SHE'D BE WAITING FOR YOU UNDER THE PIER. Gloria: FUCK! SHIT! PISS! LOOK AT THAT. A $40 PAIR OF SHOES RUINED! NO GOOD DEED GOES UN-FUCKING-PUNISHED! THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR... YOU ROSS? HIYA, MUCHO. YOU BETTER HAVE AN ENVELOPE FOR ME, HANDSOME, 'CAUSE I GOT SAND IN MY PANTYHOSE, AND THAT DOES NOT IMPROVE A GIRL'S DISPOSITION. WAIT A MINUTE. HOLD IT. I WENT TO A PLACE ON PALMETTO STREET TO MEET A GLORIA LAMAR. INSTEAD, I FIND A GUY BY THE NAME OF LESTER IVAR WITH A BUNCH OF BULLETS IN HIS CHEST. HEY, IT'S A VIOLENT WORLD. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, WATCH TELEVISION. YEAH, BUT I GOT TO EXPLAIN THAT TO MR. AMES. I PREFER TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. HEY, I'D PREFER TO HAVE MET WITH MR. AMES IN PERSON. I'D PREFER TO HAVE BEEN BORN A NATURAL BLONDE. LET'S NOT EVEN GET STARTED ON THE SUBJECT OF WHAT WE'D PREFER, OK? THE POINT IS, IF MR. AMES WANTS ME OUT OF HIS LIFE, I GET THE PACKAGE. NO PACKAGE TILL YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT LESTER IVAR. THAT WASN'T PART OF THE DEAL. THIS IS A NEW DEAL. FINE. HAVE IT YOUR WAY. HERE. UH, HOLD MY SHOE. SURE. I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING YOU OUGHT TO SEE. I LIKE THE OLD DEAL BET--HEY! OW! THAT HURT! LIKE I SAID, NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED. AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH? REMEMBER MEXICO, PALLY? MEL'S LITTLE FRIEND? YOU SEE? I'VE BEEN TAKIN' LESSONS JUST LIKE YOU TOLD ME. EXCUSE ME, BUT DID WE OR DID WE NOT AGREE THAT YOU WEREN'T GONNA SHOW YOUR FACE? I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, OK? SMART. REAL, REAL SMART. YOU KNOW WHERE I'VE BEEN TAKING LESSONS? UNH! IN JAIL. YUMA, ARIZONA. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO YUMA? WELL, THAT'S WHERE THEY PUT ME AFTER YOUR FRIEND, MR. JACK AMES, HAD ME ARRESTED FOR TRANSPORTING A MINOR. YOU WANNA LEARN TO KICK ASS, THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE THAN YUMA. IS THIS GONNA TAKE ALL NIGHT? OK. COME ON. I NEED YOU TO WAKE UP, PALLY. LISTEN. I WANT YOU TO TELL MR. AMES... THAT THIS... IS JUST A DOWN PAYMENT ON WHAT HE OWES ME. CAN YOU REMEMBER THAT, PALLY? HMM? HMM? ARE YOU FINISHED? YES, I'M FINISHED. OOH! DID WE OR DID WE NOT MAKE A PLAN? YES. WHAT IS THE POINT OF MAKING A PLAN AND GOING OVER IT IF YOU'RE JUST GONNA SAY FUCK IT WHEN IT SUITS YOU? GLORIA, WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO NEGATIVE? OH, SHIT. HEY! HEY, CHIEF, WAKE UP! HEY, WAKE UP, MAN. YOU CAN'T STAY HERE. THE TIDE IS COMING IN. HARRY. HARRY, IT'S ME, YOUR OLD PARTNER. WHAT? SOMEBODY BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF YOU. IT'S LUCKY I CAME ALONG, OTHERWISE YOU WOULD'VE DROWNED. BUT I SAVED YOUR LIFE. DON'T WORRY. YOU CAN THANK ME LATER. SO I'M SITTING IN THE LIMO IN THE PARKING LOT AT THE SANTA MONICA PIER-- I'M ON THE JOB. SOME RICH KID, SWEET-16 PARTY-- AND WHO DO I SEE BUT MY OLD PARTNER HARRY ROSS. WE ARE NOT PARTNERS. WE WERE NEVER PARTNERS. I'M TELLING YOU THE STORY OF HOW I SAVED YOUR LIFE, OK? HEY, IT'S NOT NICE TO INTERRUPT. WHERE WAS I? OH! OH, YEAH. SO I'M SITTING THERE WAITING. I SEE YOU GO DOWN TO THE BEACH. I FIGURE YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOME BACKUP. SO I'M COOL. I PICK MY SPOT. YOU WHAT? I WAIT, JUST LIKE YOU TAUGHT ME. AFTER A WHILE, I SEE 2 PEOPLE COME OUT FROM UNDER THE PIER, AND THERE WASN'T ANY SIGN OF YOU. SO I THINK TO MYSELF, HEY, THIS DOESN'T LOOK SO GOOD. SO I GO DOWN TO THE BEACH, AND THERE YOU WERE. AND THAT'S WHEN I SAVED YOUR LIFE. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. I WAS DOWN THERE GETTING THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF ME, AND YOU WERE UP IN THE PARKING LOT WAITING? AND YOU CALL THAT BACKUP? HEY, I GOT A GOOD LOOK AT THEM. I GOT A BETTER LOOK THAN YOU DID. WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD THAT I'M NOT A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR ANYMORE? HEY, MAN, YOU CAN'T JUST QUIT. YOU WERE THE BEST, THE GREATEST. OK. OK, MAYBE NOT THE GREATEST, BUT YOU WERE GOOD, MAN. REAL GOOD. WE WERE A HELL OF A TEAM. REUBEN, WE WERE NEVER A TEAM. I MEAN, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I GAVE YOU SOME LEG WORK, WHICH YOU USUALLY SCREWED UP. THAT DOES NOT MAKE US A TEAM. LISTEN, HARRY, YOU GOT TO LET ME IN ON THIS CASE. I CAN'T TAKE THIS JOB ANYMORE. IF IT'S NOT THE FREEWAYS, IT'S THE DISPATCHERS. IF IT'S NOT THE DISPATCHERS, IT'S THE CLIENTS. SPEAKING OF WHICH, WHERE ARE THE KIDS? WHAT KIDS? THE SWEET-16 KIDS. AY, CARAJO. UH, YOU THINK THEY'RE STILL THERE? I WOULD LOOK. OH. OH! LISTEN, BOSS, IF YOU EVER GET INTO A JAM, YOU NEED SOME BACKUP AGAIN, THEN YOU GIVE ME A CALL. ANY TIME, DAY OR NIGHT, I'M YOUR MAN. NICE PLACE YOU GOT HERE. I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT. I HAVE TO HAND IT TO YOU, HARRY. YOU ALWAYS MANAGE TO LAND ON YOUR FEET. VERNA, I LIVE OVER THE GARAGE. JACK AMES OWNS THE PLACE. I JUST WORK HERE, MORE OR LESS. YOU NEED STITCHES. I BROUGHT HIS DAUGHTER BACK FROM MEXICO A COUPLE YEARS AGO, AND I WAS IN, WELL, PRETTY BAD SHAPE, SO HE LET ME HOLE UP HERE. THEN HE GOT SICK, AND I WAS HELPING OUT. WELL, THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO. ACTUALLY, THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT. IT'S TIME I WAS LEAVING. THAT'S THAT ACTRESS. CATHERINE HAYWARD, RIGHT? YEAH. DIDN'T SHE USED TO BE MARRIED TO THAT ACTOR... COME ON. HE DISAPPEARED. WHAT WAS HIS NAME? BILLY SULLIVAN. YEAH, THAT WAS IT. THAT WAS 20 YEARS AGO. BET SHE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS ANYMORE. HEY, SHE'S-- SHE'S OK. OK, HARRY, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS? GOT NO PLANS. OH, COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? YOU GONNA GO BACK TO WORK? YOU GONNA RENEW YOUR LICENSE? WHAT? VERNA... I WAS A COP FOR 20 YEARS. I WAS A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR FOR 5. I STARTED OUT... WITH A WIFE AND DAUGHTER, AND I ENDED UP A DRUNK. SLEPT IN THE OFFICE AND SHOWERED AT THE YMCA. YOU THINK I WANNA GO BACK TO THAT? BESIDES, I'M GETTING RUSTY. I'M A DANGER TO MYSELF. I KNOW. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? YOU USED TO BE A BETTER LIAR. REALLY? LESTER IVAR... DIDN'T HAVE ASTHMA. HE HAD EMPHYSEMA, WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN IF YOU EVER WORKED FOR HIM. HARRY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO QUESTION JACK AMES. HIS WIFE, TOO, PROBABLY. HE'S REALLY SICK. COME ON, HARRY. THIS IS A MURDER CASE. LESTER IVAR WAS THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER WHEN BILLY SULLIVAN DISAPPEARED. LESTER IVAR WAS ON THE FORCE FOR 30 YEARS. HE MUST'VE HAD A THOUSAND CASES LIKE THIS. WHAT MAKES THIS ONE SO SPECIAL? YOU, HARRY. YOU'RE THE GUY WHO SHOWED UP AT IVAR'S HOUSE. YOU'RE THE GUY WHO LED ME HERE. LIKE YOU SAY, YOU'RE GETTING RUSTY. Harry: ABOUT THE ONLY PERSON I COULD THINK OF WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME WAS RAYMOND HOPE. PLUS HE OWED ME. EITHER THAT, OR I OWED HIM. I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHICH. ANYWAY, IT WAS RAYMOND WHO PULLED ME OFF THE BARSTOOL THAT I WAS LIVING ON 2 YEARS AGO, AND INTRODUCED ME TO THE AMES. SEEN IN A CERTAIN LIGHT, EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE THEN WAS HIS FAULT. MAYBE I'D TELL HIM THAT. YOU ALWAYS WERE A SHOWOFF, RAYMOND. HARRY? DAMN. I ALMOST PEED ON ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING FRIENDS I HAVE IN THE WORLD. HOTSHOT. YOUR SPRINKLER FRITZED, OR ARE YOU JUST LAZY? HARRY, DON'T YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO WALK UNDERNEATH A MAN-- JESUS. LOOK AT YOU. WELL, SOMEBODY DISAGREED WITH ME FROM BEHIND. NO, SHIT. LET'S GO FIND THE SON OF A BITCH, AND DISAGREE BACK. [SNICKERS] YOU ANY TOUGHER THAN YOU LOOK? HELL, YES. LEAST I USED TO BE. I USED TO BE. WE ALL USED TO BE. THEN HAVE A DRINK. UH, YOU STILL A BOURBON MAN? TAKE A GINGER ALE IF YOU GOT ONE. DO I LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO'D HAVE A GINGER ALE? WATER. THAT I CAN HANDLE. [BIG BAND JAZZ PLAYING] IT GONNA BOTHER YOU IF I DRINK? GO AHEAD. NICE PLACE YOU GOT HERE. SURE BEATS LOS FELIZ. YOU'RE UP ABOVE THE SMOG. WELL, I LIKE TO THINK I'M UP ABOVE A LOT OF THINGS SINCE I RETIRED. SO... YOU WERE PLAYING THINGS PRETTY CLOSE TO YOUR VEST LAST NIGHT. ARE YOU IN TROUBLE? OH, NOTHING I CAN'T HANDLE. IT'S JUST THAT... JACK. YEAH, I FIGURED THAT MUCH. AND YOU WANNA TALK TO ME ABOUT JACK AND LESTER IVAR. OK. YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW THAT IVAR WAS THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER WHEN BILLY SULLIVAN KILLED HIMSELF. CAN'T CALL IT SUICIDE. THEY NEVER FOUND A BODY. THE L.A. TIMES CALLED IT A SUICIDE. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH... FOR LESTER IVAR. YEAH, LESTER DIDN'T BELIEVE IN GOOD LUCK, NEVER HAVING HAD ANY HIMSELF. OH, BILLY'S SUICIDE WAS GOOD LUCK FOR JACK AND CATHERINE. WITH HIM OUT OF THE WAY, THEY COULD GET MARRIED. LESTER JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THE WAY HOW IT ALL WORKED OUT SO SMOOTH. I HAVE NEVER BEEN A GREAT BELIEVER IN LUCK-- NOT AS A WAY OF EXPLAINING THINGS, THAT IS. ANYWAY, HE'S DEAD NOW. END OF STORY. WOULD BE... IF I HADN'T PASSED THOSE SUSPICIONS ON TO VERNA. FORGIVE ME, HARRY, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU PASSED THEM ON TO YOU. BY THE WAY, I, UH, I HEARD A RUMOR I DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE WAS TRUE, SO... THOUGHT I'D JUST ASK YOU DIRECTLY. THE WAY IT WAS TOLD TO ME, WHEN YOU WERE DOWN IN MEXICO BRINGING THE AMES KID BACK? SHE, UH, SHE... SHE SHOT YOUR PECKER OFF. HARRY. HARRY! HARRY! NO. I'M FINE. BUT THANKS FOR TELLING ME. THAT EXPLAINS A LOT. I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT. UH, KEEP ME POSTED, HUH? LIKE YOU SAID, JACK AND I GO WAY BACK. IF THERE'S ANYTHING I COULD DO FOR HIM, I WOULD. AND I'M GLAD NOBODY SHOT YOUR PECKER OFF. ME, TOO! ME, TOO. [STARTS ENGINE] HOW YOU FEELING? WELL, MY HUSBAND HAD A HEART ATTACK, AND THE DOCTORS ORDERED HIM TO STAY IN THE HOSPITAL, AND THE NURSES ADVISED HIM TO STAY IN THE HOSPITAL. I PLEADED WITH HIM TO STAY IN THE HOSPITAL. SO NATURALLY, HE'S ON THE WAY HOME. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT. FACT IS, I... CATHERINE? THE AMBULANCE IS HERE. EXCUSE ME. YOU WOULDN'T BE FALLING IN LOVE WITH MY MOTHER, WOULD YOU? POOR YOU. I'M CURIOUS. WHAT KIND OF MAN FUCKS HIS DYING BEST FRIEND'S WIFE? NOT A GOOD ONE. HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON BETWEEN YOU AND CATHERINE? I BET YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING TOGETHER EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN SICK. ONE NIGHT. [SIGHS] IF YOU HAD AN OUNCE OF DECENCY IN YOU, YOU'D HAVE LEFT THIS HOUSE BY NOW. CATHERINE KNOW YOU'RE BEING BLACKMAILED? THERE'S PRECIOUS LITTLE THAT CATHERINE DOESN'T KNOW. AND WHAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW, SHE SUSPECTS. I'M THE ONE THAT NEVER SUSPECTS. I DELIVERED THE ENVELOPE TO GLORIA LAST NIGHT. SHE'S LOVELY. YOU OUGHT TO MEET HER. GOOD. SO IT'S OVER. IT IS OVER, RIGHT? I KEPT THE MONEY. SHE'S GOT THE RESTAURANT SECTION OF THE PHONE BOOK. WHY? WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST DO WHAT I ASKED YOU TO DO? BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME I DID WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO, SOMEBODY EMPTIED A 9-MILLIMETER AUTOMATIC IN MY DIRECTION. AND THE SECOND TIME, GLORIA... SHE BROUGHT ALONG A PAL. JEFF. YOU REMEMBER HIM. MEXICO? THE GUY THAT RAN OFF WITH MEL. YOU HAD HIM THROWN IN JAIL IN YUMA. HE SANDBAGGED ME. OH, HE LEFT YOU A MESSAGE. HE SAID THAT WAS JUST A DOWNPAYMENT. BEEN A BUSY LITTLE BEAVER, HAVEN'T YOU? PLAYING DETECTIVE. FUCKING MY WIFE. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO BILLY SULLIVAN, JACK? OH, JESUS CHRIST. YOU'RE FIRED, HARRY. HMM. NOW I'M CURIOUS. HOW ARE YOU GONNA FIRE SOMEBODY YOU NEVER PAID? I'LL FIND A WAY. OK. I GUESS THIS IS GOOD-BYE. HEY. SIT DOWN. I WANT YOU TO FIND THIS GUY JEFF AND DEAL WITH HIM. YOU OWE ME. HARRY. YOU HAVEN'T SAID YOU'RE SORRY. YOU HAVEN'T BEEN LISTENING. WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS WHO? WHERE'S JEFF? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ME. THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU AND ME. IT'S ABOUT YOUR OLD MAN. HARRY, YOU WERE A COP. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO TO TRUST? YOU DON'T. NOT IF YOU'RE A COP. YOU LEARN WHO NOT TO TRUST. IT'S A TRICKY LIFE. JEFF SHOWED UP A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. AND HE DIDN'T HAVE A JOB OR ANY MONEY OR ANYTHING, SO I GAVE HIM THE KEYS TO THE RANCH HOUSE. I TOLD HIM IT WAS JUST TILL HE GOT BACK UP ON HIS FEET. IT WAS A PRETTY DUMB THING TO DO, RIGHT? LISTEN, HARRY, I'M--I'M SORRY, OK? I KNOW I'VE KINDA BEEN A PAIN IN THE ASS. I DIDN'T MIND. I DIDN'T MUCH LIKE IT WHEN YOU SHOT ME, THOUGH. Harry: THE AMES OWNED A PLACE NORTH OF THE CITY. NONE OF THEM HAD BEEN THERE IN YEARS. YOU MIGHT THINK THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT, BUT HOW DO YOU FORGET ABOUT A HOUSE? THEN AGAIN, MAYBE THEY HADN'T FORGOTTEN, OR MAYBE THEY WERE TRYING TO FORGET. MAYBE THERE WAS A REASON NOT TO SELL A MILLION DOLLAR PROPERTY EVEN WHEN YOU'RE HARD UP FOR CASH. SOMEBODY ELSE HAD APPARENTLY COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION. SOMEBODY WHO THOUGHT THEY COULD DIG UP THE PAST WITH A SHOVEL WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE TO DIG. SOMEBODY WHO WOULDN'T HAVE TO BREAK IN, BECAUSE HE HAD A KEY. SOMEBODY... WITHOUT MUCH INTEREST IN HOUSEKEEPING, BUT WITH A SERIOUS APPETITE FOR BARBECUED CHICKEN WINGS. SOMEBODY NOT TOO BRIGHT, WITH A LOT OF TIME ON HIS HANDS, AND THE KIND OF PATIENCE YOU LEARN DOING TIME IN PLACES LIKE YUMA, ARIZONA. [CAR APPROACHES] [ENGINE STOPS] [CAR DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] OK, PALLY. [SIGHS] [CELL PHONE RINGS] ROSS AND ESCOBAR. CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATIONS. "ROSS AND ESCOBAR"? I THOUGHT YOUR NAME SHOULD GO FIRST, AMIGO. HEY, BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO START PULLING YOUR WEIGHT. HEY, I'M GONNA NEED SOME BACKUP. HOW SOON CAN YOU MEET ME AT A PLACE CALLED GARVEY'S? THIS TIME OF NIGHT? 15 MINUTES. REMEMBER THE PIER? REMEMBER THE GUY THAT WAS THERE? WELL, I'LL BE INSIDE WITH HIM. IF WE COME OUT TOGETHER, FOLLOW US. IF HE COMES OUT ALONE, FOLLOW HIM, AND, REUBEN... BEING BACKUP MEANS BEING THERE WHEN I NEED YOU. I CAN'T BE UNDERNEATH THE PIER GETTING THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF ME AND HAVE YOU UP ON TOP DOING SURVEILLANCE. YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE THAT? WHAT? WHAT, YOU THINK I'M A FUCK-UP? 15 MINUTES. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] GUESS YOU DIDN'T DROWN, HUH, PALLY? NOPE. THAT'S GOOD. YOU KNOW, I GOT THAT ENVELOPE HOME, AND GUESS WHAT? NO MONEY. YOU KNOW HOW THAT MADE ME FEEL? SILLY. STUPID. INCOMPETENT. PISSED. NO KIDDING? YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS PISSED? MUCHO. YOU THINK I'M TROUBLE? YOU DON'T EVEN WANNA SEE GLORIA WHEN SHE'S MAD. MAYBE THIS WOULD HELP. YEAH. YOU MIND IF I TAKE A PEAK? I MEAN, I ALREADY GOT A PHONE BOOK. THAT'S GOOD. HAVE A SEAT, PALLY. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M ALL DONE BEING PISSED. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT. [GULPS] [CHOKING] MAMA CASS DIED CHOKING ON A CHICKEN BONE, YOU KNOW? [JEFF COUGHING] EVERYTHING OK OVER THERE? TOO MUCH TABASCO. THESE GUYS. [COUGHING] [GROANING] [EASY LISTENING MUSIC PLAYING] [LOCK CLICKS] WHY DOESN'T THIS SURPRISE ME? HI, MUCHO. YOUR PALLY OUGHT TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER LINE OF WORK BESIDES BLACKMAIL. HE DON'T HAVE THE KNACK. I DON'T HAVE THE KNACK? SHE'S THE ONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE KNACK. ASK WHOSE IDEA THIS WHOLE FUCKIN' THING WAS. GOD, YOU'VE GOT A BIG MOUTH. ASK WHOSE IDEA IT WAS TO TRACK DOWN IVAR AND LOOK FOR SOMETHING ON THE AMES GUY. ASK HER! [CLATTER] OW! GLORIA, WHERE ARE THE Q-TIPS? WE DON'T HAVE ANY. YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING IN HERE! OW! OH, MAN! YOU KNOW, I COULD SUE YOU FOR THIS! PUT SOME ICE ON IT. PUT SOME ICE ON IT? THAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO, HUH? JESUS. HI, SHELLY, IT'S ME. YEAH, I'M UPSTAIRS. UM, COULD YOU BRING ME SOME OF THOSE PERCODAN? YES, NOW. BOY, YOU SURE CAN PICK 'EM. IT'S A KNACK. WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. OH, HO HO! DO YOU REALIZE WHAT I WENT THROUGH TO GET THAT MONEY BACK? YOU GOT THE MONEY? YES. WHERE IS IT? GOD, YOU ARE SO PATHETIC. YOU MIND TELLING ME HOW YOU FIT INTO ALL THIS? I'M HIS PAROLE OFFICER. LIKE HE SAID, WE LOCATED IVAR. FOUND OUT HE HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR WILD TURKEY. ONCE WE GOT HIM TALKING ABOUT THE OLD BILLY SULLIVAN CASE, WE COULDN'T SHUT HIM UP. SAID HE'D HAVE SOLVED IT 20 YEARS AGO IF THEY'D GIVEN HIM A COURT ORDER AND A BULLDOZER. THEY WAY HE FIGURED IT, THE BODY HAD TO BE BURIED OUT AT THAT RANCH THAT AMES OWNS, THE ONE NOBODY GOES NEAR ANYMORE. THAT'S WHEN I GOT THE IDEA TO CALL MEL. GET HER TO LET ME STAY AT THE RANCH HOUSE SO I COULD LOOK FOR THE BODY. I TRIED TO EXPLAIN WE DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO FIND SULLIVAN'S CORPSE. WE JUST HAD TO CONVINCE AMES WE KNEW WHERE IT WAS BURIED. BUT I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SAVED MY BREATH. OK, LISTEN UP, YOU TWO. THERE'S $10,000 IN THIS ENVELOPE. I GOT NO INTEREST IN SEEING YOU GO TO JAIL, AND NEITHER DOES JACK AMES. BUT I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT OF L.A., AND YOU'RE GONNA STAY OUT. GET A MOVE ON. WE DON'T HAVE ALL NIGHT. [WHISPERING] Listen, do me a favor. If there's any more trouble, leave her out of it, all right? I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON'T PUT SOME ICE ON THAT NOSE. WILL YOU STOP SAYING THAT? YOU THINK YOU CAN BE ALL NICE TO ME, AND I'LL FORGET WHAT YOU DID, BUT I WON'T. I GOT A LONG FUCKIN' MEMORY, PALLY. RIGHT. YOUR MEMORY'S ABOUT AN INCH LONGER THAN YOUR DICK. THAT'S VERY FUNNY, GLORIA. [KNOCK ON DOOR] YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT ACT TO VEGAS. [GUNSHOT] JEFF! GET DOWN! [GLORIA SOBBING] NO! NO. HYAH! JESUS CHRIST. HEY, MAN, I WAS JUST DOING WHAT YOU TOLD ME. YOU SAID DON'T STAY ON TOP OF THE PIER WHILE YOU GET THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF YOU UNDER THE PIER. SO THAT'S WHERE I WAS! UNDER THE PIER! MUCHO? GOD. I'LL GET AN AMBULANCE. NO. STAY WITH ME. STAY WITH ME, PLEASE. HOW IS HE? I NEVER LEARN. ALL MY LIFE, I... I PICKED THE LOSERS. I KNOW BETTER, TOO. JESUS CHRIST. SURE YOU WANNA BE IN THIS LINE OF WORK, HUH? JACK, IT'S ME. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT HOUSE OF YOURS IS WORTH? WELL, SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO STAND BAIL FOR ME TONIGHT. AND, JACK, ONE OTHER THING. I AM FUCKING FED UP WORKING FOR YOU. [EXHALES] [DIALS PHONE] LIEUTENANT VERNA HOLLANDER, PLEASE. I'LL WAIT. I'M GOING TO PRETEND THAT YOU WEREN'T HERE TONIGHT, WHICH IS ALMOST TRUE. VERNA... IT'S ME. HOLD ON A SECOND. HOLD THIS FOR ME. GO ON HOME. I'LL CALL. VERNA, LISTEN. [SIGHS] UHH. I GOT A REAL MESS. YEAH. THERE'S 2 OF THEM. THEY'RE DEAD. BETTER GET UP HERE. YOU EXPECT ANYBODY TO BELIEVE THIS? [CLEARS THROAT] OK. SO... JUST BETWEEN US-- THE TRUTH. FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE? DID IT EVER STRIKE YOU THIS IS A LOUSY WAY TO MAKE A LIVING? YOU START OUT THINKING YOU'RE GOING TO WIN A FEW, BUT MOSTLY, IT'S... IT'S JUST LIKE TONIGHT-- WATCHING PEOPLE RUN OUT OF THE... LITTLE BIT OF LUCK THAT THEY GOT LEFT. YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BEAT THE ODDS, BUT YOU DON'T... OR NOT VERY OFTEN. EXCUSE ME, LIEUTENANT. JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THE CAPTAIN'S ON HIS WAY. GOD HELP YOU, HARRY. LET ME GO, VERNA. NOT A CHANCE. GIVE ME 24 HOURS. I WILL FIND THE SON OF A BITCH. I PROMISE YOU. [FLUSHES] YOU HEAR THAT? THAT'S MY CAREER IF I LET YOU WALK OUT OF HERE. I SCREWED UP, RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. 2 PEOPLE ARE DEAD BECAUSE OF IT. I MEAN, YOU GOT TO GIVE ME SOME TIME, SO I CAN FIND WHOEVER DID IT AND... I DON'T KNOW, SQUARE THINGS UP AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT. HEY, WHAT'S-YOUR-NAME, GET HIM OUT OF HERE. YEAH, BUT THE CAPTAIN SAID-- I SAID GET HIM OUT OF HERE. HARRY. [FLUSHES TOILET] REUBEN... I NEED YOU TO MEET ME. 36001 MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY-- IT'S RIGHT ABOVE THE CANYON. HOW SOON CAN YOU GET THERE? OK, AND... REUBEN, BRING MY GUN. I MIGHT NEED IT. Reuben: YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT IT IS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR? WELL, I GUESS NOT. LISTEN, BOSS, I GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, OK? SURE. I HOPE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE MAD AT ME, BUT... THE THING IS... AFTER WE CRACK THIS CASE, I'M THINKING MAYBE I'M GOING TO FIND ANOTHER LINE OF WORK, IF THAT'S OK WITH YOU. IT'S OK WITH ME. I DON'T KNOW, MAN... WATCHING THAT LADY DIE TONIGHT-- I CAN'T GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD. YEAH. I KNOW YOU HAD BEEN COUNTING ON ME, BUT-- I SAID IT WAS OK. YOU DON'T THINK THAT I'M, LIKE, A COWARD? NOT FOR A SECOND. I GUESS WE CAN STILL BE FRIENDS, RIGHT? I MEAN, WE CAN STILL-- [HITS OBJECT] HARRY? OHH. WHAT DO WE DO NOW, HARRY? COVER IT UP. HEY, I KNOW I'M THE ONE THAT KEEPS FLUNKING THE P.I. EXAM, BUT WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO CALL THE COPS? I SAID COVER IT UP. BUT THAT'S A BULLET HOLE. DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO IT IS? I KNOW WHO IT IS. YOU KNOW, HARRY, THE THING YOU JUST DON'T GET ABOUT JACK AND CATHERINE IS THEY LIVE FOR EACH OTHER. THEY HAVE THE STARRING ROLES IN THEIR OWN LIVES, AND YOU'RE JUST A BIT PLAYER. ME, TOO. BUT IT'S THEIR LOVE STORY, NOT YOURS. YOU DON'T GET TO KISS THE GIRL IN THE END. SHE'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S GIRL. Jack: YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT I'VE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND DO THE CHEMOTHERAPY. IT WORKED BEFORE, SO... YOU NEVER KNOW. AT LEAST, I THOUGHT YOU'D BE PLEASED. WE FOUND BILLY SULLIVAN LAST NIGHT... OR WHAT'S LEFT OF HIM. WELL, I GUESS I'VE BEEN EXPECTING THAT FOR 20 YEARS. LOOK, YOU CAN THINK WHAT YOU LIKE. IT WASN'T MURDER. IT WASN'T LIKE YOU... MURDER SOMEBODY. CATHERINE AND I HAD FALLEN IN LOVE. AS YOU KNOW, CATHERINE'S EASY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH. EVENTUALLY, BILLY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AND CAME AFTER ME. I WAS STAYING OUT AT THE RANCH. SUDDENLY, I TURN AROUND, AND THERE HE IS, SO DRUNK HE CAN HARDLY STAND UP, SWEARING HE'S GOING TO KILL ME. THE SWIMMING POOL WAS EMPTY. YOU SHOULD'VE HEARD THE SOUND HIS HEAD MADE WHEN HE HIT THE BOTTOM. YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THE WAY HE JUST LAY THERE AND DIDN'T MOVE. ONE SECOND IS ALL IT TOOK, AND A MAN'S LIFE WAS SNUFFED OUT. YOU ARE GOOD. YOU ARE VERY GOOD. AND I WOULD'VE BELIEVED YOU, EXCEPT I SAW THE CORPSE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THERE'S A BULLET HOLE IN THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. NOPE. DID YOU BOTHER TO GO DOWN AND LOOK AND SEE WHETHER HE WAS ALIVE? OF COURSE NOT. BECAUSE THERE WAS BLOOD, AND THERE WAS A BODY, YOU DIDN'T WANT ANY PART OF IT. YOU JUST WANTED SOMEONE TO COME ALONG AND MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY, SO YOU CALLED RAYMOND HOPE. WHAT'D HE SAY? TOLD ME TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE. AND HE'D COME AND CLEAN UP THE MESS. BUT RAYMOND... LIVED IN LOS FELIZ BACK THEN. IT WOULD'VE TAKEN HIM--WHAT-- AN HOUR TO GET THERE? WHO ELSE DID YOU CALL? IF YOU HARM HER IN ANY WAY AT ALL, I SWEAR TO CHRIST, I'LL COME BACK FROM THE GRAVE, AND I WON'T BE IN A FUCKING WHEELCHAIR, EITHER. [PUTS OUT CIGARETTE] QUICK, COME LOOK AT THE SUN. Catherine: SEE IT HANGING THERE JUST HALF AN INCH ABOVE THE HORIZON? IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER, DOESN'T IT? YOU LOOK TIRED. YEAH. I AM TIRED. I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE GETTING KILLED. I'M TIRED OF BEING LIED TO. WHEN HAVE I LIED TO YOU? WHEN YOU ACTED AS THOUGH YOU LOVED ME. WHEREAS, IT TURNS OUT I LOVE MY HUSBAND? IS THAT WHAT I'M BEING ACCUSED OF? I NEVER MADE IT A SECRET THAT I LOVE MY HUSBAND. ENOUGH TO KILL FOR? YOU BET. YOU FEEL BETTER NOW THAT WE'VE CLEARED ALL THAT UP? I DON'T FEEL WORSE. WELL, THEN... WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK ME SOME MORE QUESTIONS THEN? FEEL FREE. AND YOU'LL TELL ME THE TRUTH? YES. DID YOU KILL LESTER IVAR? NO. NEXT QUESTION. DID YOU HAVE HIM KILLED? NO. NEXT QUESTION. DID YOU KILL JEFF WILLIS OR HAVE HIM KILLED? NO. NEXT. 20 YEARS AGO... WHEN JACK CALLED YOU TO TELL YOU WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO BILLY SULLIVAN, DID YOU-- DID I DRIVE OUT TO THE RANCH, FIND BILLY STILL ALIVE, PUT A GUN TO HIS HEAD, AND PULL THE TRIGGER? NO. I SAID I LOVED MY HUSBAND ENOUGH THAT I WOULD KILL FOR HIM, HARRY, NOT THAT I DID. NOW LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. DO YOU BELIEVE ME? [CHUCKLES] I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE. I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE SMART... AND YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL AND RICH. I BELIEVE THAT LIFE HAS WORKED OUT FOR YOU IN WAYS THAT IT DOESN'T FOR MOST PEOPLE. I THINK PEOPLE LIKE YOU GET USED TO HAVING IT WORK OUT FOR YOU, AND AFTER AWHILE, YOU BEGIN TO... THINK THAT YOU ARE ENTITLED TO ALL THE THINGS THAT-- DO YOU THINK I CARE ABOUT ANYTHING IN THIS HOUSE BUT MY HUSBAND? YOU THINK... YOU THINK PEOPLE LIKE ME CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THINGS... THAT WE WOULD KILL FOR THEM? IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK? THAT I JUST CARE ABOUT THINGS, HARRY? IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK? THAT I CARE ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS? ALL THESE FUCKING GODDAMNED... THINGS? THEN MAYBE PEOPLE LIKE YOU SHOULDN'T GET CLOSE TO PEOPLE LIKE ME. DO YOU WANT TO COME INSIDE, OR DO YOU LIKE IT BETTER OUT THERE? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT WE WENT FISHING? YOU TELL ME. IT'S TOO LONG. LET'S GO. RIGHT NOW, YOU AND ME, HEAD DOWN TO BAJA. FINE. LET'S HAVE A DRINK FIRST. GOT SOME GINGER ALE IN THE FRIDGE. I'LL TAKE BOURBON. THINGS THAT BAD? YOU TOLD ME I MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW. CATHERINE. YOU GOING TO TURN HER IN? I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, THEN I DECIDED TO GO FISHING INSTEAD. THAT WOULD BE THE SENSIBLE THING. I MEAN, SCREW IT. EVERYBODY PRETTY MUCH GOT WHAT THEY DESERVED. IF WE LEAVE SOON, WE COULD BE DEEP IN BAJA BY MORNING. WE OUGHT TO TAKE THE EXPLORER. THAT BEATER OF YOURS WILL NEVER MAKE IT. YOU KNOW, AND LESTER IVAR WAS A CROOKED COP. IT'S MY HUNCH HE WAS TRYING TO SHAKE JACK DOWN. THE MARLIN OUGHT TO BE RUNNING ABOUT NOW. I KNOW A GUY WHO'LL TAKE US OUT FOR 80 BUCKS A DAY AND A CASE OF AMERICAN BEER. BUT THE FUNNY THING... IS THAT... YOU KNOW, LESTER LIVED IN A RAT HOLE. YOU'D THINK IF HE WAS ON THE TAKE, HE'D... I MEAN, YOU'D THINK HE'D HAVE A PLACE THAT WOULD BE MORE LIKE... MORE LIKE THIS. YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED YOUR DRINK. RAYMOND, THIS IS NOT EASY, BUT YOU DID A LOT MORE THAN CLEAN UP JACK'S MESS, DIDN'T YOU? NOT A LOT MORE. BILLY SULLIVAN WAS GOING TO WIND UP IN A WHEELCHAIR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. I ENDED HIS MISERY, HARRY. I DID HIM A FAVOR. YOU SEE, I THINK THAT ON THAT LONG DRIVE OUT TO THE RANCH, YOU BEGAN SPENDING THAT MONEY THAT JACK WAS GOING TO PAY YOU TO KEEP HIM OUT OF JAIL. I THINK THAT... YOU BOUGHT THIS PLACE IN YOUR HEAD ON THAT RIDE. AND THEN, WHEN YOU GOT THERE, YOU FOUND OUT BILLY SULLIVAN WASN'T DEAD. YOU KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO LOSE IT BEFORE YOU GOT A CHANCE TO MOVE IN. THEY REALLY GOT TO YOU, DIDN'T THEY? I CAN UNDERSTAND ABOUT CATHERINE. A WOMAN LIKE THAT CAN TWIST A MAN'S PECKER INTO A KNOT, I'LL GRANT YOU, AND JACK'S A CHARMING GUY, BUT I GOT TO ASK YOU, HARRY-- DON'T YOU EVER GET TIRED OF THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE? DOESN'T IT EVER BOTHER YOU THAT THE JACKS AND THE CATHERINES OF THIS WORLD CAN DO AS THEY PLEASE BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS GUYS LIKE YOU AND ME WHO WILL CLEAN UP AFTER THEM? JACK AMES COULDN'T GET BLOOD OUT OF A SOCK WITH A WASHING MACHINE AND A GALLON OF CLOROX. ME? I CAN GET BLOOD OUT OF A SOCK. THAT'S WHAT I DO. I CLEAN UP MESSES, AND I GET PAID FOR IT. YOU IMAGINE IT DIFFERENT, HARRY, BUT YOU'RE THE SAME AS ME. YOU THINK IT WAS CATHERINE WHO SEDUCED YOU. IT WAS BOTH OF THEM, HARRY. IT WAS THE WHOLE PACKAGE. AH... I KNOW. I WAS THE SAME WAY. LET'S FACE IT-- THERE'S THEM, AND THERE'S US, AND RIGHT NOW, THE THING FOR US TO DO IS GO FISHING. I'D LIKE TO, RAYMOND, BUT-- DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I DIDN'T KILL YOU THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS? OK. I'LL WAIT UNTIL I GET INTO TOWN BEFORE I CALL VERNA. MAKE A RUN FOR IT IF YOU WANT TO. OH, I CAN'T DO THAT, HARRY-- NOT AT MY AGE. BESIDES, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, YOU WERE RIGHT. I COULDN'T GIVE UP THIS PLACE. NOT THEN... AND NOT NOW. WELL... SHIT. I KNOW. IT'S A BITCH, ISN'T IT? GOOD LUCK, HOTSHOT. GOOD LUCK TO YOU. YOU KNOW, I CAN SEE YOUR REFLECTION IN THE GLASS. IT'S FUNNY THE THINGS YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE BUYING A HOUSE. [KNOCK KNOCK] OH, THANK GOD. I HATE PLAYING SOLITAIRE. I CAN'T STOP CHEATING. ONE HAND FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE OWE. DO I HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT? YEAH, YOUR HEALTH. [SHUFFLES CARDS] DEAL THEM, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, BEFORE YOU WEAR THE SPOTS OFF. I HAD TO SHOOT RAYMOND HOPE TONIGHT. DEAD? DEAD. TURNS OUT HE KILLED BILLY SULLIVAN... SO YOU CAN REST EASY ABOUT CATHERINE. I'VE ALWAYS RESTED EASY ABOUT CATHERINE. IF SHE HAD MURDERED HIM... IT WOULDN'T MATTER TO YOU, WOULD IT? NO. IS THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US, DO YOU THINK? RIGHT, WRONG, TRUTH DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? TONIGHT, MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME THAT SHE LOVES ME. DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE? I'M SURE OF IT. MY WIFE SAYS SHE LOVES ME. IS THAT TRUE? YES. ARE YOU SURE? I'M SURE. ME, TOO. AND YOU? YOU SAY YOU'RE MY FRIEND. IS THAT THE TRUTH? THAT'S THE TRUTH. I'M SATISFIED. ENOUGH TRUTH. YOU PRICK, YOU. YOU'VE GOT GIN, HAVEN'T YOU? FUCK YOU. JUST ME? NOT THE HORSE I RODE IN ON? HIM, TOO. HERE, LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND. I GOT IT. I GOT IT. OHH... YOU KNOW, HARRY... YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE. YEAH, I DO. [SIGHS] I DO. DO YOU MIND HITTING "PLAY" ON THE WAY OUT? WHO'S THAT HANDSOME DEVIL? [CHUCKLES] IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. DROP BY ANYTIME YOU FEEL LIKE IT. I MEAN IT. I--I'M FEELING A LOT BETTER. I MAY JUST BEAT THIS THING YET. Jack on TV: NOBODY RACES UNLESS I SAY SO. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. THAT'S WHY THEY MADE ME THE COACH. YEAH, YOU SKI FAST. YOU RACE... BUT YOU'RE RECKLESS. YOU CRACK UP. Egan: THAT'S IT? THAT'S IT. OK. ALL RIGHT. THAT'LL CONCLUDE THE INTERVIEW. IT'S OCTOBER 20, 1997, AT 0600 HOURS. BUT THAT'S NOT QUITE IT, IS IT, HARRY? NO, NOT QUITE. [PLAYING THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU] YOU KNOW, AFTER MY DAUGHTER DIED, I STARTED HITTING THE SAUCE PRETTY BAD, AND IT BECAME OBVIOUS MY WIFE AND I WEREN'T GOING TO MAKE IT. IT WAS RAYMOND WHO TOOK ME IN, LET ME SLEEP ON HIS COUCH. YOU COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON RAYMOND. WHILE I WAS TALKING TO JACK, YOU WERE TALKING TO HIM. YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT LESTER IVAR. [STOPS PLAYING] [RESUMES PLAYING] YOU HAD HIM TAKE CARE OF WILLIS AND GLORIA. I NEVER ASKED HIM TO KILL ANYBODY. YEAH, BUT YOU KNEW HE WOULD. [PLAYS] TELL ME, DOES IT BOTHER YOU... THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE WOULD'VE BEEN ALIVE IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU? [STOPS PLAYING] MY HUSBAND IS STILL ALIVE. THAT PLEASES ME. AND I DON'T REALLY THINK I'M TO BLAME FOR ANYTHING YOU'VE DONE. HARRY. STILL LOVE ME? LOVE YOU, TOO. Verna: SO... CATHERINE AMES GETS AWAY WITH IT? NOT REALLY. OH. SOMEBODY OUGHT TO GET AWAY WITH SOMETHING. YOU WANT TO BUY ME A CUP OF COFFEE? OH, YEAH. SO, HOW ABOUT THE CAPTAIN? ANY FALLOUT? [CHUCKLES] WELL, LET'S JUST SAY I'M NOT EXPECTING A PROMOTION ANYTIME SOON. FUCK IT. IT'S ONLY A CAREER. BUT NO DISCIPLINE? NO. WELL, I GOT SOME VACATION TIME COMING, AND IT WAS STRONGLY SUGGESTED I TAKE IT. HEY. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT GOING AWAY MYSELF. I REMEMBER CATALINA. THAT WAS... NICE. HOW ABOUT A RETURN ENGAGEMENT? MAYBE. [COINS JINGLE] OH. VERNA, I NEVER KNEW YOU CARED. JUST CHECKING. THAT'S FAIR.
