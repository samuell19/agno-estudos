Going to find her. Going to find her. I'm going to find her. Well, I've been searching. I've been searching. Oh, yeah, searching every which way. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I've been searching. Searching. I've been searching every which way. I'm like a Northwest Mountie. You know I'll bring her in. I'm going to find her. I'm going to find her. Well, now if I have to swim the river, then know I will. And if I have to climb a mountain, you know I will. And if she's hiding up on Blueberry Hill, am I going to find that child? You know... Hey, Vic, what you doing here? That's my stop. It's OK, Fly. We took care of it. Smile. I'm like that Northwest Mountie. You know I'll bring her in. I'm going to find her. I'm going to find her. Hey, come on, Fly, will ya? Yeah. Hurry up, will you, Jack? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Hey, Fly, hurry the fuck up. Don't forget the Martini. Some day, some way, you'll realize that you've been blind. Yes, darling, you're going to need me again. It's just a matter of time. Oh. You spill one drop, jerk off, and you're going to lick it up. Come on, Fly. You can do it. Come on. I see a drop, Fly. I see a drop. There it is. Come on. Get the wings going, baby. Fly man, all right. You know something, Fly? You win the grand prize for the ugliest fucking waitress I've ever seen in my life. I ain't a fucking waitress, Sal. Ah! Ah! You are whatever the hell I say you are. Ah! If I say you're a waitress, then so be it. Yeah. Never talk back to me, Fly. Because you know where these are going to end up, don't you? Yeah. Yeah. Give the lady a drink. Show her what a good fucking waitress you are. Ah. Ah! That's very good, Fly. You're going to stand there like a fucking moron? Hey, Fly. I want you to go see Joey. Tell him I want three pictures this week, not two. Tell him to stop jerking off to his work. Take Mickey with you, too. Why do you call him Fly? Why don't you tell her, Vic. Because flies eat shit. Here you go. It's all yours. What is it? It's your lunch. Where's Joey? The editing room. It's Mickey. Put him on the shelf. Shake those things. I'm shaking them. Shit. Come on, baby. turn around. Ow! Keep still. I'm trying to read. Hi, Margaret. Oh, hi, Frankie. OK, action. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. OK. Reslate it. She's pretty good. Oh, yeah. She's a regular Meryl Streep. Her concept of improvisation is sticking a dick in her mouth sideways. So what brings you around, Fly? I had to drop off a case rubbers.. Of course you did. We do want to appear to be safe-sex conscious in case the kiddies see. I had to bring Mickey over, too. Oh, Jesus Christ. He's the sickest most perverted son of a bitch I've ever fucking seen. He has a strange way of showing power. Fly, keeping your enemy's nuts in a jar on a shelf is not an expression of power. It's just a sick and demented act created by a sick and demented person. By the way, Sal told me to tell you that you're working too slow. He says that you're not meeting his quota. Too fucking slow? What does he fucking think I am, the miracle worker? Do you know how many hours I spend with these derelicts just trying to get them to suck a little bit of cock without falling asleep, trying to get them to look the least bit excited, and on top of that, having the incessant burden of trying to get them speak? Gah. They're related? I did not say incest. I said... forget it. You're too sensitive. I'm supposed to be fucking sensitive. I'm a director. I'm an NYU film graduate, not some Ellis Island fucking tutor... Used to working with artists, people who give a shit about their work, insightful people who want to expand the boundaries of their creativity, not hacking together fuck flicks for the third world. You are some ass piece of baby. Ugh. I can't... Piece of of ass, Hans, piece of ass. You are piece of some ass, baby. Piece of ass. Jesus Christ, get him a script. You know, I might be able to dub in his voice, I mean, give him a more American quality. Please, Fly. I almost forgot. Sal also said to tell you that the check ain't in the mail. He hasn't paid me in a fucking month. He cannot keep me caged up here like some laboratory fucking rat content with a few acorns. It ain't that bad. I cannot live without money, moron. Joey, there is no reason to talk to me like that... No reason. Now you know you should never have gotten that deep in the hole with Sal in the first place. You have got nobody to blame but yourself. I swear to God, Fly. Somebody must have fucking cursed me. I've never seen a losing streak like that in my life. I don't know how you're ever going to get out. It's not exactly what I wanted to fucking hear right now, Fly. OK? How much is it, 100 Jesus, huh? What? Excuse me, Joey, but how long before we start again? Why, Margaret? Do you have an etiquette class you have to go to? Don't be so smart. I just want to run down and get a cup of coffee. Bullshit, a cup of coffee... she wants to run down there and get fucked up. I do not. I'm just a little tired. That's all. Margaret, please explain to me how on Earth you could be tired. You've been on your back the whole goddamn day. Hey, if you think it's so easy on the other end of that horse cock, you do it. Could probably do a better job. Come to think of it, you probably would. You calling me a faggot? If the shoe fits. You fucking cunt. - You fucking cunt. - Hey, hey, look... I'll go get the coffee. There's problem. You ungrateful bastard. Hey, come on, you guys. Cool it, will you, you know? You better watch your mouth, punkin. That's delusive outfit is getting to your head. Asshole. Hey. Misfits... just one of my fucking misfits. Hey, Margaret, wait up. I'll go with you. It's OK, Frankie. I can go by myself. Nah, let me go with you. You don't know. I mean, this is a bad neighborhood. Come on, baby. It's a New York thing. Thank you. Well, there you go... Straight from the tar pit. Thank you. Oh, you want to sit down here? I guess Fellini can wait, right? I mean, what's the jerk off going to do, start without me? Wait. Wait. Wait. Frankie, I can't sit on that. That's a good jacket. Good butt deserves a good jacket. Hope I don't get any jelly on it. What? Just kidding... I washed. - Oh. - Here... feel. No. No, that's all right. I trust you. How come you get so nervous? I'm not nervous. Come on. Touch my butt. No, I don't want to. See, you're nervous. No, I'm not. Are too. How come i never see you with any girls? I don't know. I got 'em. Bullshit. I just don't want to bring them around. That's all. I like you, Frankie. You're a nice man. You know, of all the people that I know, you're the only one that calls me Frankie, not Fly. Does it bother you? What? That they call you Fly? It's a little late for that. No, it's not. You can change things if you want to. It's never too late. I used to know this guy... Used to pay me $200 to put one of these up my butt so he could eat it. He used to come by every Thursday afternoon. He never took his clothes off either. Want a bite? No, thank you. What's the matter with you? Oh, I just don't feel like talking about that derelict shit. What are you insinuating? I mean, well, you participate in that kind of shit, it don't look good. You trying to say I'm a fucking derelict or something? No. No. - I'm no fucking derelict. - No. All I meant to say was... All you meant was I'm a fucking derelict, Frankie. Don't deny it. - No. No. No. I never said that you were a derelict. Yes, you did. You said I'm a fucking derelict. You said I participate. I mean, who the fuck are you, some kind of morals committee or something, sitting there in your $3.00 suit, all high and mighty, judging me? I'm not judging. What I do don't hurt nobody, OK? I don't treat nobody bad unless they want it that way, unlike you and your friends... Fucking animals. You treat yourself bad. I'm making a living, Frankie, the best way I know. You put that shit in your arm. That's dying. That ain't living. Do you see me putting that shit in my arm, huh? Do you see me? I'm talking... Hey, no, no. Don't you fucking hit me. Well, then answer the question. Do you see me doing dope? Not lately. Not lately... that's right. Because I've been straight for eight fucking weeks, OK? I'm kicking that shit. Do you understand? I'm kicking it. That's good. I'm saving my money. And I'm going to get the fuck out of here. I came out here to be an actress, OK, not a junkie, only I got a little off track. Carlos, my friend. Come on, guys. I'll make it worth your while. Goddamn it. Hello, Joey. How are you today? Euphoric. I live for days like this. Well, that's good. Every day above ground is a good one, right? Regular utopia. Will that be all? Unless, Miguel, you can find one of your amigos to make a horse bet for you. Why would I do that? I don't bet horse. I know you don't bet horse. You wouldn't be betting horse. I'd be paying for it. Joey, I already have six children. It will do me no good to have my nuts cut off by Sal. Sal's not... Joey, please. Have a nice day. You, too. Hell. No. You know what your problem is? You ask too much of people, Joey. All right. All right. I'll come over, you know? I mean, it's Friday. I GOT to make my rounds first, all right? OK, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, is... Is Margaret working today? Yeah, oh, good. Good. Yeah. No, I just wondered. Yeah. OK. All right. Thanks. Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Hey. Hey, baby. I wanna know if you'll be my girl. Hey. And action. Hans. Number two. You called my name. I opened the door. What do you want me? Be my girl. When I saw you walking down the street, I said that's the kind of girl I like to meet. She's so pretty. Lord, she's fine. I'm going to make her mine, all mine. Hey. Hey. - Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Relax, all right? Come on. Take it easy. Yeah. If you'll be my girl. I don't understand this. This never happens to me. Turned and walked away. There's something that I want to say. Come on, baby, give me a whirl. Hey, how you doing? I want to know if you'll be my girl. Hey. Baby. I want to know if you'll be my girl. You've go to say it. I will not. It's stupid. You are the most incredulous bitch I have ever known. What's going on? Artistic differences. I know what incredulous means, asshole. I know what incredulous means, you asshole. How did you learn it, graduate school? Very funny. You are the most insecure, talentless loser! Hey, hey, what's the matter? Garbo here does not like the script. It's the same corny shit I say every time. Excuse me, sir. I have this tickle in my throat. Do you have something I could scratch it with? Since when, Margaret, did you ever give a shit about anything you say or do? - Hey. Hey. Hey. Don't fight, you guys. Excuse me, but could somebody get me out of this, please? Shut up. Ow. Joey, take it easy. You're going to hurt somebody. - He doesn't care. He's an animal. You know, Margaret, when you were a much better actress when you were high. You'd know exactly when to open your mouth, and exactly when to shut it. You would love to see me break, wouldn't you? The only thing I'd like to see you break is your fucking neck. There is no need to be nasty, Joey. Fly, mind your own business right now. Maybe you should rewrite it. Rewrite what? The scene. God forbid, Mr. NYU. Fly, this is the last fucking thing I need right now, OK? - Margaret! - Fuck off. OK. I'll leave. No. No. No. Come on. I got to talk to you. - All right. OK. But settle down. Calm down, OK? - OK. I'm calm. And don't pull on my jacket. OK. I'm not pulling on your jacket. Where did you get that? I've been saving every nickel and dime I could get my grubby little fucking hands on. Now please, just put it on the fourth horse in the seventh race, Sudden Fury. And I swear to God, I will not ask you for another favor. Joey, you're not such a lucky guy. You should really think that. Fuck thinking about it, Frankie. Come on, just do it. If Sal gets wind of this, we're both dead. Sal's not going to find out. Besides, my horse is going to fucking win. I'll pay him a little more money back. He'll be happier than a fucking gerbil in West Hollywood. Come on, Frankie, please. And if he loses, then you're behind even more. Frankie, he's the only chance I got. I bet my way into this hole. I gotta bet my way out of it. This is a big favor I'm doing here, Joey. This is a very, very big favor. What do you want me to do, Frankie, suck your cock? I don't play with that shit, Joey, not with guys. And you know that. Frankie, I was not serious, fucking idiot. Oh. Come on, man. The race is at 4:30. You got to be there at 4:00. Don't be late. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What? Well, it seems like I'm taking all the chances here, all of the risk. And I'm not sure why. What do you want, Frankie? Come on... spit it out. What do you want? I want to write a movie script. What? I want to write a movie script. That's a great idea. I mean really... That's a great idea. Really? Absolutely. I mean, who knows what kind of talents might surface there? You think so? Yeah. You know what? Second you get back from the track, you and I will talk about it. Nah. Frankie. Frankie, look. You got my word, OK? You can write the script. You've got my word. Keep a knockin' but you can't come in. Keep a knockin' but you can't come in. Keep a knockin' but you can't come in. You keep it close, huh? No problem. OK. I'll be right back. - All right. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah. Hey, you take it real easy with it, OK? No problem. Hey! Hey! Hey! Come back! Hey! Hey! Keep a knockin' but you can't come in. Keep a knockin' but you can't come in. Keep a knockin' but you can't come in. Come back tomorrow night and try it again. What are you, crazy? Give me the goddamn keys. I told you to take it easy. Get out. Don't you know a goddamn vintage fucking automobile when you see one? I guess. You don't guess. It is. Do you have any idea why it looks as good as it does? Cause I don't zoom it around like some goddamn Hot Wheels. I take care of it, which is possibly a concept that you can't understand. Sounds like fucking Chinese to you, don't it? You ain't got the slightest idea what in the world respect means, do you, huh? Well, let me give you a little fact. That's why the world is turning to shit. Because you kids, you got no respect for nothing... No respect. Nothing lasts. You got no Sinatras. You got no Elvises. You got nothing. Here today, gone tomorrow. It's all just... it's all just a quick fix, no tradition. Now you give me my money back. Get a haircut. Yo, how much time before the fourth race? Just went off. Who won? Sudden Fury, that fucking pig bastard. Fuck. Is Sal here, Jack? Yeah. He's in his office. Thanks, Jack. Sal? Oh. Come, darling. Oh. Sal? What? What do you want? Speak. I want to make a loan. A loan? For what? I don't know. I... I got some things I want to do. Well, what kind of things? Things, like... Why are you being so evasive? You trying to hide something from me, Fly? How much you want? $6,000. Oh, god. That's enough. That's enough. Oh. You have no future in show business. Can I try again? I'll get it right. I promise. - No. Get out. Maybe I made her nervous. Huh? She's got teeth like a beaver. That's a lot of money, Fly. Oh, Mickey lost his nuts for a lot less than that. I'm not looking to lose my nuts, you know, Sal? You know what I mean? Yeah. Hey, come on. I'm not planning to lose my nuts, Sal. Huh? Yeah, well, neither was he. You should have seen his face. I'll do this for you, Fly, because I like you. Hey, I like you. What are you, queer? Come on, no. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm just checking. When do you want it? I want it now. I hope for your sake, you're spend your money wisely. I hate to see you make a bad investment, you know? Well, I appreciate this, Sal. Thanks. Don't make me spot you, Fly. I'll spot you bad. I heard the results on the radio... $6,230. Jesus Christ. I almost came in my pants. You fucking counting? I mean, it's all there. I just want to feel it. Do you mind? Where do you think Margaret is? Hopefully at the vets, getting shots. Hey, try to be nice, will you, Joey? She's a nice girl. Sure she is, Frankie. She's a fucking junkie. What the fuck are you? Touche. Then you. Should heed my words even more closely, my friend... Once a junkie, always a junkie. It's just a matter of degree. We still got a deal, right? Of courses we got a deal, Fly. A deal is a deal. Don't call me Fly. My name is Frankie. You really going to do this for me? Why not? And Joey's going to go along? Loves the idea. Loves? Loves the idea. What about Sal? Yeah, well, we're going to kind of like not tell Sal till we got a more solid story. You're getting my hopes up again, Frankie, you know that? Hey, you got to have hopes, right? Oh, it sure would be nice... Get a good piece of tape of myself, who people what I can do, you know? Be like the next Jodie Foster. Yeah, maybe, although she was awful good in that movie, um, the one where the guy ate people. I can do that kind of stuff. Eat people? No, drama things. Oh. No, I'm not saying that you can't. Because that's what I came out here to do, you know, serious things like... I know. I'm not just some low life who's got no talent. I know that Hey, timing is everything, right? Maybe this is our time... Make some noise in this town. Yeah. It is. What's the matter? I'm fine. Hey, you OK? I just... I don't feel... What... Margaret? Margaret? Margaret? Oh. My god. Oh, my god. Oh, shit. Somebody call an ambulance! Hey, you OK? Come on, Margaret, please. Don't do this. Someone hurry up. Hurry the fuck up, will ya? Is there a problem here? Look. I'd like a little more coffee, please. What are you doing? You were just dead there. - We're fine. I'd just like a little more decaf, please. Yeah. Yeah. What the hell was that all about? I was good, wasn't I? You give me a freaking heart attack here. I told you I could do drama. Nah, it's not funny, Margaret. You scared the shit out of me. I was just playing. Yeah, well, don't play with people's hearts. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Frankie. Hey, buddy. Hey. Hey. Hey Here you go. Be right back. Hey, buddy. Get the door for the lady, will you? Thank you. Well, thanks for dinner. It was great. It was the best I've had in a long time. Well, hopefully we'll be able to do that again sometime. I would love that. And I'll behave. I promise. Oh, yeah. Great. All the luck, huh? OK. See ya. See ya. Hey. OK. Good night and sleep tight. And don't let the bed bugs bite. - OK. OK? All right. Whoa! Huh. Ah! Whew. Hell, I see you all are bent to... OK. Oh, hell, I see that you all are bent to set against me in your merriment. Can you not hate me, as I know you do? Then... Shut the fuck up, lady. Hey. Can you... can you not hate me, as I know you do? But you was... Oh. What are you writing... Secrets? Nah. Ideas. Ideas? Yeah, ideas. Well, what kind of ideas? I don't know. What do you mean, I don't know? What, are you a fucking parrot? I said I don't know. How could you not know? They're your ideas. Because they haven't come to me yet, you see? That's what an idea is. It's something you don't know but comes to you. Comes to you how? It's an idea. Well, how can an idea come to you if you're not thinking of something? Oh, I'm thinking of something. What? An idea. Fly, one more fucking time, and I'll slap your fucking head in. Look, did anybody ever say to you, don't get any ideas, huh? Of course. OK. So what does that mean to you? Tell me. All right. What it means is this. Don't think anything. Now that doesn't necessarily mean that you're thinking anything in particular. It means don't think anything new. And that also does not assume that you have any old ideas. Because you can actually be thinking of nothing, g you know, just space out. And then suddenly when you least expect it, an idea... Huh... pops up. Because it's what ideas do... They pop up. And that's what I'm doing here. You know, sitting here, waiting for an idea, thinking of nothing. Capisce? I get it. Hey, I got an idea. Yeah. Get me a fucking drink. Hey, there you go. See, that's an idea. And that gives me an idea. Fuck you. Get it yourself. You see how it works. That's very good, Fly, very good. Problem is that wasn't a very good idea. See how it works? You're right. What would you like? The usual. Good. Then if you'll excuse me now, I'll be right back. Excused. Hey, Jack. Yeah. Give me a scotch, will ya? Do me a favor. Piss in it. I already pissed in the bottle. Don't want to dilute it too much. Left some of your empties on the set. If Fly comes by, tell him to wait. Here. Really? I think so, I'll go tell him. Yo. Yo, Sal. Come on. Pick up the phone. Goddamn it, Fly. Fuck. Hey, Joe. Frankie. I've been coming up with some pretty good ideas. You got to place a couple of more bets for me. Hey, Joey, I don't think we ought to push our luck. Frankie, someone has finally taken the fucking needles out of my goddamn voodoo doll. You know what you ought to do? You give Sal what you got and don't be fucking greedy. Greedy? I'm not fucking greedy. It's that cocksucker who is greedy. Frankie, I'm just trying to get out of here. Yeah, at my expense. No. No. He ain't going to do nothing to you. If he's going to do anything to anybody, he's going to hang me. I'm an accomplice. To him, it's just as bad. Do you like like begging people to make bets for me? Joey, I don't know. Come on. What are you doing? - Come on, Fly. You got to do this for me. What did I tell you about calling me Fly? I mean Frankie... Frankie. Frankie, he's going to bury me in this piece of shit. He's a scumbag. I can't have a life with this scumbag. Please. Please. Please. Please. OK. OK, on one condition, all right? You know this script that I'm writing for Margaret? Yeah. I want to direct it, too. Well, yeah. Yeah, sure. That's a great idea. And I don't mean none of these porno flicks, neither. No. No. We're talking an epic, a saga. Look, Frankie, you can write, direct, hold the lights for all I care. I'll just... I'll just be there to guide you and help you when you need me. Please just make the bet. And we don't tell Sal nothing? We don't tell Sal a fucking thing. The movie, you and I, we make it on our free time. We just use that cocksucker's film. OK. All right. Whatever you want. Ah, Frankie, I knew you wouldn't let me down. I got two horses... One in the six and one in the eight. You're trying to tell me something, ain't you? Huh? Out of the stretch, it's Hurly Burly, Happy Time, neck to neck. It's Hurly Burly. - No. No. Now shut them the fucking down. Shut them down. Shut them down. Shut them. Yes! Yes! Yes! I love you. I love you. Everything all right? Yes. This is amazing. It's going to be the first porno ever to get an Oscar. I'm not kidding you... just awesome. Here, look. going to like my work here. Ha! Son of a bitch. Brilliant. Brilliant. Here she is, yeah. Slow down. Vic. Hey, what are you doing around here? Actually, we was looking for you, Margaret. - Yeah? - Come on. Get in. Hey. Hey, doing a little shopping? Ah, looking mostly... Picked up a little scarf. Oh. That's nice. It's good that those things will make you feel good , huh? Where we going? Uh, Sal wants to see you. About what? Didn't say. Hey, you all right? Yeah. I'm fine. No work today? Down time. Got my period. Oh. Yeah. It's good to have a legitimate excuse to take some time off from work, right? Vic, what's going on? Huh. Oh, that? He's just checking out the texture of some new stuff. That's all. Vic, why don't you pull over and let me out, OK? I can't do that. Why not? I told you. Sal wants to see you. Why does he want to see me? Well, Margaret, Sal is a funny guy. I can't really figure him out sometimes, you know? I think he went a little cuckoo when his old man died. It's like he's afraid of change, likes things to stay the same. Yeah, well, sometimes change is good. Personally, I agree with you. But I also think there's a time and a place. How about a little music, huh? Want some music? Vic. Go on, feel it. Enjoy the music. Have a little something with us, huh? Come on, Vinny. Come on. Stop, Vic. Stop it. Stop it, goddammit. There you go. Come on. Come on. That's better. Hello, Joey. Sal. If I'd known you were coming by, I would have brought you a cup of coffee. Oh, thanks a lot. That's very thoughtful of you. You want mine? I don't drink coffee. So what brings you around, Sal? Why don't you sit down? You look kind of tense. Me, tense? Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine. Sit down! OK, I'll sit down. Doing a little reading, have you? You mean this? No. No. I just like to test myself, you know, and see how I've been doing. It's nothing. What do you use to play with, Monopoly money? So... so what are you doing here, Sal? You already asked me that once. You think I'm hard of hearing? No. No. I mean it's just that, you know, I mean, you never come down here. I hear everything, Joey. I got what's known as 20/20 hearing. 20... 20/20 hearing... That's a good one, Sal. That's really funny. Is it? Is it funny? Sometimes I have trouble distinguishing what's funny and what's not. I never know. Maybe you can help me out with something. Sure. Want you to listen to this and tell me whether or not you think it's funny. He's the dirtiest piece of shit. He's a scumbag. I can't have a life in this scumbag. Please. Please. Please. Please. OK, one condition... You know the script I'm writing for Margaret? I want to direct it, too. Frankie, an epic, a saga... you can write, direct, hold the lights for all I care. I'll just... I'll just be there to guide you. Please just make the bet. And we don't tell Sal nothing? We don't tell Sal a fucking thing. The move... you and I, we make it on our free time. We just use that cocksucker's film. Is that funny? No, Sal, that definitely is not funny. I didn't think so. My gosh. Man, a microphone. Even the cocks have ears around here. Now that's funny. Hey, it's Roman Polanski. Come on. Hey, Sal. What's up? I hear that you want to make a movie. Come on. What's the matter? You got stage fright? Is she OK? Oh, yeah. She's fine. We just gave her something to relax her a little bit to get her... You guys grab Fly and sit him down. Give him a comfortable seat. I want him to see the show. But Sal, I... Not a word... I'm going to do you a favor and not allow you to say one fucking word, because you're just going to lie. And it's going to jeopardize our friendship. Now where is Joey's money? I mean my money. Oh, it's... it's in my pocket. Well, get it out. I don't like to wait for answers. Well, you know, I didn't mean you no wrong. Well, yes you did. No. You broke a trust. And that is a big no-no. Oh. $6,000. You're a little short, Fly. That's all I got. That's all you got? Well, we've got a little problem here then. According to my sources, uh, you're about $146,000 short. Well, I fucked up. I got a flat on the way track. And... and I didn't get there in time, you know, to make the bets. You fucked up. You fucked up. You got a flat. Oh, I see now. I understand. OK. Well, it's only money, right? We'll just forget all about it. But I don't think so, because we'd been missing a golden opportunity to look into our souls and search our hearts and ask ourselves, why did this happen? Why? I must I ask myself, who is going to benefit the most from this little demonstration here today? Certainly not Joey... I mean, let's face it, it's over for him. He's not in control. Not only that, but you know, he's... He's a scum. Hey. Now, I think you will know never go against me again for something like that. That is a pig, Fly. Sal, please. She didn't have nothing to do with this, nothing. Oh, you're wrong. She had everything to do with it. She corrupted your mind. She... she... she... blinded you, much more so than you even realize. She's the reason you were going to fuck me. No, Sal, you're wrong. You're wrong. I'm... I'm... I'm never wrong, Fly. I'm going to show you what a pig she is. And after that, we're going to play a little guessing game. It's called Who's Nuts are in the Jar? Give him the jar. Whose name you think is going to be on there? Joey? You? Sal, please. How do you think they're going to look, all cold and shriveled up? Maybe they'll be magnified because they're in the glass. Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Sit her up. OK, Fly. I want you to watch this. Turn him around. Look how good she is, Fly. She loves it. And... and... and... and I love it. Open your fucking eyes. Everybody, look at the movie star. No. Volare! Piss on her. Oh. Yo, what about him? Fucking blind him. Make him a cyclops. If he ever fucks with me again, we'll take out the other one, see how much vision he has then. Let's go for a ride. Your hands look kind of... Kind of tight and tense on that wheel there, Fly. That happens to me sometimes, too, usually when I want to kill somebody. You want to kill somebody, don't you, Fly? You want to kill somebody like me? Now be honest. You want to kill me, don't you? Say it. Say it. Say it. - Yes. Yes. Yes. Ha. It'll pass. I appreciate your honesty, I must say. But do you know, I'm doing you a favor. You'll realize in the long run that this writing thing is no good for you. You're just setting yourself up to get hurt, setting yourself up for disappointment. Fly, nobody made Margaret do drugs. She did that on her own, because she's weak. Weak people will always go back to doing what they do best, what they know. Why don't you take a couple of days off, figure out what you want to be... One of the wolves or one of the sheep? There he is. Thought you'd died. What, are you disappointed? Hey, maybe a little. Shut up, Vic. How are you feeling? Yeah, fine. Want to play? Nah. I don't really feel like it. How about washing my car? Do you feel like doing that? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Margaret? Margaret? Yo, baby. Hey, your name? Frankie. I'm looking for Margaret. Have you seen her? Yeah, I saw her. She's over by. Garrison Bridge? All right, thanks. Uh-huh. Later. Bye. Woo-ee. You got the big man's car. Fly man is big time. Come on. Get in. You lonely, baby? Do you want some company? Yeah. Yeah. Get in. You're , huh? I didn't know you was kinky, Fly. Hm? - Kinky Fly. - No. No. Put your clothes on. Hey. Isn't this what you want? Hm? What you always wanted? Yeah, but not like this, all right? Hey, baby. I'm sorry. How's the Fly want? Hey, don't call me Fly, please. All right? Come on, baby. Come on. Margaret. Yeah? Margaret. Shh. Yeah. Margaret. Oh, that's it. Yeah. That's the prize. You read the Bible, huh, Frankie? Yeah, sometimes. Well, like it says in Psalm 23, the Lord is your shepherd. And you shall not want. What did you say? I make it. I said the Lord is your shepherd. No. I don't need no shepherd. I ain't no fucking sheep. You hear me? OK. OK, baby. So maybe you don't need no shepherd. But I bet you sure could use a little pussy. No. Stop this. Will you stop this? You're supposed to be strong. You've got to be strong. Don't you ever fucking lay a hand on me, you piece of shit. I'm stronger than you'll ever be. OK? - OK. Ever. You're the one who's weak, riding around in your big man's car. car from the inside, hoping for little handouts. Why did you have to go and get high? Why? Yeah. Ask your friend Vic, Sal, your friends. OK? That's the ones who fucking shoved it in me. Do me a favor, huh? Stay out of my fucking life. Hey. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Here. It's all washed. I took it out for a little spin. I hope you don't mind. Come on, Frankie. What the fuck are you doing? Take me home. Frankie. Come on. Sit over here. Nobody can hear us talk out here. Talk about what? Our movie. Our movie? Frankie, I ain't making a fucking movie with you. Do you understand me? I am not. Now you gave me your word. I gave you my word when I had two fucking eyes, before I looked like a fucking mummy. Well, at least, you know, listen to my idea, OK? Forget it. Now would you please listen? Hey, it's great. Sit down. Fuck. I'm going to kill Sal. I do not want to hear this. I do not want to hear... Jesus Christ. What the fuck are you doing, Fly? Could you please listen to me? Be careful. Get the fuck off of me. Listen to me, please. OK? I'm a fucking fake, pretending, all right? I never really could do it, you know? What you gotta do when you... Well, when you take somebody out, make a hit, it never seemed right to me. But it seems right now. And I'm going to kill that cocksucker. And I'm going to do it on film. I want the whole world to see what a punk he is. All right. Bang. And I'm going to do it. You've lost your fucking mind, Frankie. I don't think so. Hey, but you could be right, you know? There is a fine line between insanity and genius. Take it from me... You crossed it. We got to do it, Joey. You got to do it. We got a deal. Fuck you, we got a deal. The deal was you make the bets, we make a movie. Frankie, you never made the bets. Oh, yes, I did. You said you got a flat. I did. And I wasn't going to go. And then, you know, I thought sometimes God wants you to overcome adversity. And so I changed that tire. And I got there. And I made that bet. And it was beautiful. Why the fuck didn't you tell me or Sal? It wouldn't have mattered. It wouldn't have mattered? They took my fucking eye. Yeah, chances are he would have taken it anyway. You are the most... Oh, no, no. Now you're to hurt yourself. You're going to hurt yourself. What the fuck do you think this is, a minor corneal abrasion? Hey, you want your goddamn money or not? Yeah. - Help me up. - OK. We're good. Good. Good. Good. Yeah. Come on now. Come on now. Now you just take it easy now. OK? There, huh? So I'm going to need a little more advice, you know, on like, on how to use camera and sound and shit like that. And then maybe you could, like, well, I mean we just go on and do it like we were before your little mishap. Now don't you start on me, all right? I mean, this is a hell of a way to treat a guy that did you a favor. A favor? Yes, a favor. If I had given Sal all the money, you wouldn't have shit right now. You'd be standing on the corner of Alvarado and 6th selling pencils, staring at people out of that goofy fucking eye of yours, begging for change. So shut the fuck up. You're rich. I kill Sal, it's like putting the money right in your pocket. How much money have you got left, Frankie? I got all of it. $143,000... is that enough? I thought it would be. Hey, it's a beautiful day. It's like shit. Yeah, well, I mean, this will burn off, you know? So you didn't see nothing, huh? Not a fucking thing. You know, find this note... Says got your car, Guinea fuck. You got any balls, come and get it. And you know, sitting on the front seat of my car. Guinea fuck. Yeah, mano, mano, motherfucker. Hm. Sounds like a setup to me, Fly. I don't think so. I'm thinking that this is some macho thing, you know? Like... like he says, mano, mano. What do you think, Vic? Jeez, it's hard to figure. It's a good opportunity. For what? to get my fucking brains blown out? No. No. No. No. Hear me out. I think I got a good plan. You think? Yeah. We'll let him think you're coming alone, like he wants. And then you won't. Because I'll be with you. You? Hey, what kind of bullshit is this? I mean, come on, huh? Let him... let him talk. There's one thing that's bothering me. Why do you want to do this so bad? Well, I got two reasons. One is I want to film it. You want to what? I know it sounds crazy, but think about it. It could be really cool. And what good exposure, huh? To who? The fucking FBI? No. No. No. No. No. No. No... to these kids that don't know who you are, show these punks, huh? Set an example of how not to fuck with you. This is fucking stupid, huh? What the fuck? Let him... let him say it. Let him go on. Yeah. Mind your own fucking business. Hey, don't tell me to mind my fucking business, OK? I don't fucking like that. OK. Well, fuck you, man. Fuck everybody. I'll go myself. I'll get the car back. OK? I'll do it. Yeah, soon as he calls up at 10:00, I'll make him believe that I'm you. You? Yeah, me, huh? Maybe it's about time I make a hit, huh? Yeah, maybe it's about time that the word spreads. You don't fuck with Frankie the Fly. Sit the fuck down, Frankie the Fly. Maybe he's right. Maybe we can really show them, you know? Let's show them what big balls we got. Why don't you run along now in case you need to get, you know, contacted. Mhm. Yeah, sure. I'll do that. All right. I think I better take these, huh? Oh, man. He's a lot of fun. You think this could be dangerous? The day I've got to worry about Frankie the Fly is the day that I should be dead. You pretty women, stand in line. I'll make love to you, baby, one a time. I'm a man. And I spell it M-A-N. Ain't that a man? All right. Love that song. It's so inspirational... Makes me feel so alive. This is it. Is that a guess? No, I mean, it looks like the place he described. Well, what now, Mr. Camera Man? Well, I... I guess I'll go and look. And I'll see if your car is there. What's all that about? What are you doing? I'm going to wear it like a disguise. I thought you wanted everybody to recognize you. I do. But I figure, you know, I'm going, like, make believe I'm a homeless guy till I check it out. You thought of everything, didn't you, Fly? Now You'll come if I yell, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. But I'm going to... I'm gong to take this with me. You think maybe, uh, maybe I could have that? No, I think not. You don't need a gun, Fly. Cause you got big balls. Hey, Fly. Give me the gun? I think that we're going to need this. Right. Sal dies... take one. Take two. Yo, Sal. Hey, Sal, Sal, Sal! Look, here it is. Here it is. Ha. Ha. Look. Wow. Yeah. What a surprise. So where's the dirt bag? I don't know. Uh. But I'll get him. Hey, motherfucker, come on out here, just like you said... mano, mano, huh? Come on, you cocksucker. Come on. You want to mano, mano? Come on, man. Come on. We're here... hand to hand. Come on, brother. Come on. Come on, you piece of shit. Let's see your face. Come on out here. Come on out here. Come on, you prick. Fly. What? Shut the fuck up. What? There's nobody here, man. And you know it. You took my car. What are you talking? It was you, Fly. Vic saw you do it. And he told me. Now why don't you tell me what it is you got me down here for, OK? Because you've become a problem now. And it's not fun anymore. I haven't got all night, so let's get to it. OK? What do you want? How come you never call me Frankie? What was that? How come you never once call me by my real name? What the fuck are you talking about? I'm talking about respect. I'm talking about being treated like a piece of shit all the time. I'm talking about being crumbs like a fucking pigeon. I'm... I'm more than that. I'm more than that. Is there anything else you want to say before you die? Yeah. Yeah. There was no reason how you treated Margaret. Now there was no reason for that, no reason at all. Well, you know, she's a piece of shit, just like you. No, uh-uh. No. You're the piece of shit. Yeah, you're a big man with a gun, aren't you, huh? You know, this camera things is not a bad idea. Maybe you got something. Like you said, you know, set an example. Well, why don't you come and get me, motherfucker? Why don't you come and do it like a man, take me like a man? Come on, you prick. Come on, just one shot, motherfucker. Why don't you just come here and take me like a man? I just want to get one fucking shot at you, you motherfucker. Come on. All right. Ha! It worked. It worked. Hey, it worked. It worked. Oh. Hey, look at the fucking dog now. Look at the fucking dog now. How are you doing, cheetah? I'm going to kill you. You ain't going to do dick, motherfucker, but die... That is, right after I piss on you, just like you did Margaret, just like you did to Margaret. Here, here, I can do this. Here it comes. Here. Here it comes. Ah! I'll take you with me. I'll take you with me. Ah! Yeah! Yeah! Die. Die. Die. You going to shoot me, Fly? You going to shoot me? You got no balls, Fly. Riding along in my automobile, my baby beside me at the wheel. I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile, my curiosity running wild, cruising and playing the radio with no particular place to go. Yeah, did you get that? Yeah, Frankie, I got all of it. I think we ought to do it again. That fucking guy, you know, he cut me off. And he screwed up the shot. Frankie, trust me. It's good enough. I mean, there's nothing cooler than an overhead shot if it looks right. Now you want your money, huh? Shoot the movie, capisce? Now I'm going to around the block again, all right? I'm going to pull up in front of this place. I'm going to get down. I'm going to a kind of king of the jungle thing. You got me, Mr. NYU? I got you, Frankie. Fucking actors... king of the jungle, take two. Jesus Christ, Frankie. Frank! Son of a bitch. He just shot my money. Son of a bitch. Just need you to sign these before you go. Everybody needs help. Don't be afraid to ask. Thanks. Good luck. Thanks. Hey, Margaret. This came for you while you were gone. Thanks. Hi, Margaret. I prepared a little something in case I don't see you personally for a while. I'm not from New York, like I told you. Uh, I'm from Michigan. I... I just, I talk like this because it's the way tough guys talk. And... and if I... and I figured... Ah, it doesn't matter. Anyway, I just want to tell you that I really care for you. Well, if anything goes wrong with this plan that I got, this money is yours. And I want you to have it, To maybe get yourself a fresh start, you know? Be the actress that you are, huh? OK. So maybe I'll never be an actress. But you are, huh? And I hear that New York's a nice place, friendly. Actresses go there. That's the place actresses go. So, well, um, I guess that's it. Um, I hope I see you. Um. Uh. Oh. Um. Show... show them that you got what it takes, Margaret. Show 'em you got it. OK. OK. Oh, my god. Hi, Vic. Don't say a fucking word. It won't be just your ear I shoot. You're lucky I never liked the bastard. It's $5,000. Come on. Get out of the trunk. Come on. And we go by my rules from now, not Sal's. You get on a train and don't come back. You make me look bad, I'll swat you. Hey, Fly, change your name. Try van Gogh. Ha ha. Yeah... van Gogh. Yeah. Vincent. Yeah. Vinnie. Hey, Vinnie. Yo, Vin. Yo, Vinnie. Yeah, hey, Vinnie. Yeah, that's good. How you doing? Fine. How you doing? That's it. Vince.
