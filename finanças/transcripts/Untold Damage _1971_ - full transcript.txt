There seems to be all the love he can use and then some. Now, uh, tell me, Mr. Jerome, what do you do? - I'm a Hammond organist. - Oh, how nice. I saw the organ first thing when I came in. I just love organ music. Maybe you'll play something for us if we beg you. - Certainly. - And where are you employed? - Oh, I'm not. - Well, let's see, when was the last time you were employed? - (sighs) When was that? Fireside Roundup, wasn't it? - Yes. - It's been some time, I'm afraid. - It's been um, it's been more than two years. - Well, we'll just say nothing so far this year. Um, are you employed, Mrs. Jerome? - Oh, please, call me Louise. - And I'm Irene. - Irene. Yes. I'm personnel manager at Howlett's. - And uh, you're a veteran, Mr. Jerome? - Jerry. - Jerry. - World War II. - Terrific. - I think I hear them now. Here comes Tomby! - Me, me, me! - Hello, Tomby! - Aww. - I think he's gone to get you something. - He loves new people. - But not all new people. He needs to know them first. (Louise chuckles) - [Irene] He certainly has a lot of love. - Well... We love him. - Yes, we do. - You know, Louise, it's a funny thing, but a family that loves a special child like Tomby, well, when a family loves a special child like this one-- - Me, me, me! - Obviously for Tomby-- Oh! Thank you. Did you make this at school, Tomby? - Me, me, me! - Tomby thinks he made it, but Lisa stands behind him and moves his hands. Tomby feels very proud that he can give you something that he's made. - He always gives you something. He just loves to give things. - Fishy, fishy, fishy! - These little fish cookies are his favorite. See? - Uh, he uh, wants to look in your mouth. - Fishy, fishy, fishy! Ha, ha, ha! - Tomby. Tomby, come on. Tomby. ♪ Tomby ♪ - (clears throat) Wow. Well, I can certainly see the love you've given him. Of course now that he is of adult age, he'll qualify for a small benefit. Now um, I'd like to ask him a question or two. - All right. Tomby, serious. - What is your name? - Talk, talk, talk. - No, Tomby. Tomby, what is your name? Say Gay. Gay, Gay, Gay. - Hi, Mom, Hi Mom. - This is Tomby's brother Gay, I mean Greg. Mrs. Mann. - Hi, Mrs. Mann. - Hello, Greg. Tomby's given us all our names, and we like them. - Oh, yeah. Tomby been telling you lies, Mrs. Mann? - He's been telling Mrs. Mann that he's a car. - Oh, yeah? He really is. - So, you're Tomby's twin brother? - Yes, that's right. - [Irene] I can see the resemblance. - Oh, really? - [Irene] Certainly, around the eyes. You have the same eyes. - [Louise] Yes, isn't that remarkable? - I never knew that. - You would if you spent more time around here, young man. - What did he bring you? - A dead mouse, isn't it Gay? - Yeah, that's right. - [Louise] Oh, Tomby! - Excuse me, please. - I just know there won't be any problems. Since Tomby is to be 18, let me see, Wednesday, your benefit will begin on Monday. It will come through our office at Social Security each month. Can he dress himself? - Shoe laces and buttons, no. Zippers, yes. Well, with you gone so much of the time who usually looks after Tomby? Well, Sissy. That's Tomby's name for Lisa. Lisa looks after him the most. And Lisa will be leaving us soon to get married. - [Irene] (gasps) How wonderful! - It's not really decided yet, Ma. - Oh? I thought it was. - You know it hasn't been. - (sighs) There's no one as good with Tomby as Lisa. - And Tomby will miss Sissy something awful. - Well, what about Greg? - Gay, Old Gay's a very busy young man with the ladies. Well, I took Tombo to a drive in movie just last month. - As a chaperone. - Of course, I don't see that particular girl anymore but-- - [Irene] Oh. Does Tomby like movies? - Oh, yes he does. - [Irene] Well, what else does Tomby like? - [Lisa] What doesn't he like? Cars and-- - Ballet music. - [Greg] Blowing in his face. - Yes. - Ha ha ha ha. - Does he perform certain body requirements? - Well, he can put a toothbrush in his mouth, but he can't brush his teeth. - How has he responded to toilet training? - Tomby stopped wetting at 12. - But (stammers) can he? - Well. - Uh, Sissy still, uh, wipes him. Is that what you mean? - Certainly. (eerie electronic music) (dramatic classical music) - Oh, it's only you. - It's only me, that's right. - I thought it was Daddy. - He's home. - [Lisa] I know! - Alright, what's with you? - Daddy hit him. - Where? - On his hands. - Oh well, that's not so bad. Well, I mean it's better than, uh, you know, his face or something. Why? - Oh, he emptied the fridge again. - Oh, so what, that's Tomby's thing. - Well, it's not as though he did it every day. He found the potatoes, you know? And he got the cottage cheese, and he put everybody's Jell-O in kind of a circle on the floor. In the middle was this pool of milk. - Was there any breakage? - No, it looked like he was trying to feed something. - Usually he just dumps it. - Well, he was much neater this time. - Oh, yeah? - It's been a year. - Oh, that's right, Tombo's annual party. You should have seen it. It was really neat for him. I wonder why he does it. - I don't know. - I know you don't, but don't you think anything? - I'm tired of thinking. Maybe he was trying to, uh, feed his friend Ernest. - Well, he doesn't need friends, do you think? - Not with you around he doesn't. - I suppose. - Where is Dad, anyway? - Outside swatting flies. - Outdoors swatting flies? - He's got his work cut out for him, doesn't he? - Yes, he said flies breed outside and that's where you've got to get 'em. - He's really that pissed off? - He said what he does with flies is his own business. - Well, I'm afraid our dad is a relatively uncomplicated human being. - I only wish he was. - Yeah, me too. - But why hit him? If I wasn't home... Little guy. - Dumb ass thing to do. (shushing) Where is ole Tomasino anyway? With the TV pulled out. - He's missing Space Mice right now. - I think he knows and no dinner. I looked in on him. Poor Tomby was just sitting there trembling. - Hey, no visitors. - Oh, yeah? - Really. - Well, why don't you keep an eye out for me will ya, sis? - Okay. - I'm gonna give him a book to tear. - A what? - A book, what the hell. - Gay, I really don't think, well, which one? - I don't know, some best seller. Mental Retardation Approaches, Mental Retardation: A Handbook, Sensory Retardation, Severe Retardation. It's a good thing I don't read. Here's one he'll enjoy. - Hey, Gay, I really don't think you should. - [Greg] Oh, what's the difference? Who'll know? (paper tearing) Ole Tomasino doesn't seem to be his old self today. You know, with dad laying down new rules, you'd think he's planning to overthrow the regime around here. (shushing) Well, what is she gonna say! - She'll soon see. - When is Rick coming down? - What makes you say that? - What makes me say that? Well, you don't dress this way for me. - Oh? - Oh, yeah, that's right. You look very good. - You little sex pervert. - What were you dancing today? - Tchaikovsky, Piano Concerto Number Two. I was Alicia Markova. - Well, when is he coming down? - After dinner. - Then you're gonna go to the movies? - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh, and I'm gonna be going to work, of course. So, uh, nobody'll be home for hours and hours and hours, except for the babysitter. What's for dinner anyway? - No comment. - Except for the babysitter. And the babysitter's, uh, pal. Hey, Sis, straighten this out for me, will ya? Are you making it with Rick? - Don't start that! - In this very room? - On this very sofa? - No, little creep! - Hello, Gay, mwah! Sissy, put something on. - Yes, Ma. Ma! - Hmm? - Tomby's being punished. - Aww. Where's your father? - Outside. - Has he had a drink? - I don't think so, Ma. - I think he's swatting flies. - Swatting flies? - You can see out the window. - Sissy, your father's been upset these days. - I know. - No, you don't. - How's dinner? - Good, ready anytime. - [Louise] No dinner for Tomby? - No dinner, no TV, no visitors. Would you talk to Daddy, please? You know Tomby's not gonna learn anything from this. Sissy, I think we better let Daddy decide that for himself. - Oh, Ma. - Sissy, let's let Daddy do what he thinks is right this time. - But he slapped him. - Where? - On his hand several times. - What did he do? Oh, the fridge. You know, everything on the floor. But he was really neat this time. He didn't break anything, and he just spilled a little milk. Hasn't he been punished enough? - Not this time, no. After we go to the movies, you can turn on his TV, but be sure to turn it off again. And Sissy, put something on! - Mmm, thank you, Ma! - Uh-huh. Lloyd! (water splashing) (upbeat, chaotic organ music) - Hi, Dad. Hey, you know those, uh, those shirts that Dad wears all the time? They're very in, you know? - Those plain old undershirts? - Yeah, they're called tank tops. They're very upbeat. - Don't tell your father, no peeking. Take in the water pitcher, dear. - [Greg] Okay, how's the store? - [Louise] Mm, good as ever. - Rick's comin' in. - Ahh? - Yeah. - After dinner? - Yeah. - He drives such a long way. - [Greg] I hear he's being transferred. - Oh? Transferred where? - Well, I don't know. I just, uh, I think it's a long way off, though. - [Louise] Is Sissy very upset? - Well, I don't know, Ma. She didn't tell me. I just, uh, I overheard a phone call. - Mm, she'll miss Him. He's a nice young man. - Oh, come on, Mom. - Your father and I are going to the movies. - [Greg] What are you going to see? - I don't know. (laughing) Lloyd! - What about Tomby? - [Greg] Nothing, I guess. They are going out. - The movies? - Yeah. And little brother won't be around. Hey Sissy, give me a tip, will ya? - [Lisa] I'll give you a tip. - No, no, straighten this out for me, really, Sissy. Where do you and Rick do it? On the floor here, or do you take him up to your room? - We don't do it anywhere! - Well, what do you do with him? Do you just neck? - Ma, dinner's on! - [Louise] All right, dear. - Ma? - World peace, starting with us. - Sissy? - Charity begins in the home. - Gay? - If you stand by the river long enough, the body of your enemy will float by. - Greg. - What? Uh, let Boston win the NBA title. - I didn't know you like violence, Greg. - Oh, well, um, the instruction is in patience, Dad. If you wait by the river, you can outlast your enemy. - I know that. What I don't know is why you insist on bringing these things up at the dinner table. - Boston isn't in the race, even I know that. What are we going to see tonight, Daddy? - I don't know. - When's Mr. Right coming down, Sissy? - Is Rick coming down, Sissy? - Don't call him Mr. Right. Yes, he is, Daddy. - We certainly don't see as much of him as we used to. - [Greg] Gee, I don't know why. - [Lloyd] He certainly is a nice young man. - Mm, he drives such a long way just to see you. - Gay, I'm a little curious about that necktie. A lot of men fought and died for that tie you're wearing, some of which I knew. - Dad, I only got it because I thought it would look good. - Nelly, look at the bugs on those flowers. Between the flies and the bugs, it's a wonder any one of us is left alive. - I just picked them. - Uh, have you heard from Corbin's yet, Dad? - Corbin's Texas Steakhouse had already hired somebody else. - Some young fella that learned to play the Hammond Organ by mail, I think. - Your father feels badly about it because this fella wasn't even in the union. - (chuckles) That doesn't bother me. I wonder why I have to keep on paying my dues. - I'm sorry, Pop. - They're not much. - Four times a year. - Sissy, did you do the pie? - Yes, Ma. - Banana pie for dessert. - Does anybody want any of Sissy's homemade pie? - Mom made it, I just heated it. - Well, I want some, and I'm sure Gay wants some. It's his favorite. - [Greg] Yeah, it's my favorite. - Well, I couldn't, thanks. - [Lloyd] No? - No, no I couldn't. - You're sure, Sissy? - [Lisa] No, thank you. - Gay? - Uh, no, thank you. - Well then, I guess I'll just have to eat my piece alone. - Why don't you get him, Sissy? - Oh, Daddy, thank you! - Oh Lloyd, thank you. Greg, give me a hand. - Yeah, yeah. - Tomby? Hey, Tomby. Daddy's happy now, Tomby. Dinner! Left foot. Right foot. Daddy's happy now, Tomby. Come on, come on. Oh, up! ♪ Here comes Tomby jum jum ♪ ♪ Here comes Tomby jum jum jum jum, jum jum jum ♪ Come on, Tomby. Come on. Tomby, look.

Did you get Tomby a birthday present? - Yeah, I got him a truck. - Oh, he'll love that. - That's nice. - I know he loves red trucks, they're neat! - We ought to go. - Oh, yeah. Now remember, Gay, no boozing. - Yes, sir. - Tomby, let's dance. Give me one dance, come on. - Me me me me! - [Greg] Go be a man, Tombo! - Dot dot dot, de dot dot dot! Dot dot da dat, dot dah dot dot dot! Dot dot dot dot. - Gay Gay Gay! - See, he likes you now! - Yeah, for a change, hey! - After you bought him that book. - Tombo, don't you want to come to work with me tonight? Why don't you get a job, huh? You want to go to work? You come to work with me and we, you'll spray gas on cars. - Car car car car! (doorbell ringing) - Hello, Rick. - Hi. - Hi, Rick. - Good to see ya. - Good to see you. - Hello, Rick, how are you? - Oh, hello. - How's it going, Rick? - Just fine, thank you. You going out? - Yes, to the movies. - Have a good time. - Yeah, in case you're not here when we get back, good night. - Enjoy yourselves! - Good night, Mom! - Good night, Tomby! - You're looking good. - I thought you were gonna get your hair cut? - Oh, I think I'm gonna let the Army chop it off. - [Rick] Oh, uh, here are the lists. - Oh yeah, that's right. - These are the new ventures here. These are the investors versus the regional distribution, see? - Yeah. - And way back here are the securities. We always keep them back here. You can hang onto that, if you want. - Thanks. - Oh, and this is the stuff that I did, right there. - Hey, hey, they slapped your name on it! - Yeah, I guess. How's the kid? - Tomby? Fine. - How are you, Tomby? - Me me me me, nee nee nee nee nee. - He's got a birthday coming up, doesn't he? - [Greg] Yeah. - He'll be 18, wow. - Yeah, 18 going on four. - You got him something? - Yeah, well, you know, the usual. - I forgot, it's your birthday, too! I always forget. What are you getting? - Uh, I think an Army uniform. - Do you think he knows it's his birthday? - [Greg] No. - Hello again. - Feet, do your stuff. I'll see ya later, Rick! - [Rick] Yeah. - Hey. - Alone with the babysitter. - You're the babysitter tonight. You know, you're gonna have to learn all about drinking and getting drunk. - Huh? - Oh, yeah. - Why? - Otherwise, you won't have any fun. - It makes me sick. - Okay. What happens when we have guests over to dinner, and we bring out a fancy bottle of vino? - I'll get sick. Okay, give me a sip. I could do it, I think. - For me? Yes, if that's what you want. - That's only part of it. Have another sip. - Oh, alright. - You didn't tell them. When? - You know when. No, I don't, Lisa, when? - I didn't talk to them, I couldn't. - Oh yeah? - Everything happened this week. And with his birthday coming, I couldn't. - They're moving me, and it's down to a week, Lisa. What am I gonna do? Commute 2600 miles? - I will! - I know you will. - I will! - When? - Soon. - How soon? - Very! - How about tonight when they come home? - Um, maybe. - Yeah, maybe, I have my doubts, you know? - Well, I don't. - Can't he go away? It's too early. - Maybe for him it is. Why isn't he watching television? - He's not allowed. He's being punished. - Oh, yeah. Tomby, Tomby, Tomby, you want a present? Huh? Which hand, which hand? They go to a single or double? - Double. - Yeah, home by 12:00. - I suppose. - It's funny to think of them in a drive-in movie. No offense, I just can't see them, uh. - Oh, I don't think they do. - Probably not. - [Rick] Let's go to your room. - Rick, we said we weren't going to in the house. - Well, what do they think we do, neck? - Sort of. - [Rick] They really do, don't they? They really do. They must think I'm a fairy. - Oh, I'm sure they don't. - [Rick] They know about fairies? - I think so. - Know what? - She asked if I let you pet me. - (laughs) Pet you? (blowing) (sighs) Can't he watch TV? - Daddy disconnected it. - Well, what if Rick connected it? - So, what did you tell her? I told her that I let you sometimes. - Did she ask you where? No, she thinks I just mean here. - (sighs) Your mother's philosophy. - I know. - Lloyd's just as bad. Well, everything's going to be alright in a couple of weeks. It is, isn't it? - Yes. - You're going to tell them. - Yes. - Good. Let's go to your room. - Rick! - What? - Let's wait. - [Rick] Shit! - Oh, don't say that, please! - [Rick] Well. - Well, you know how I feel here. - You mean with Tomby in the other room? - No! - Yes. - No, just here, that's all. - But it's alright in the car? I'm pushing 26, Lisa. I don't always think the car is the best place. I can see us after we're married still slippin' out to the garage at night and getting into the backseat to make love. Tell me, do you honestly think that it's all right to make love at a drive-in movie and not in your own bed? - Don't talk about it, please. I don't like to. - Why not? I'll be gone in a week and they won't even know our plans. You'd think they'd like that. - I'll tell them. - They'll just have to hire somebody to take care of him. It won't kill 'em. He moves like a cat when he wants to. - I don't agree about hiring someone else. - I know, I know. - I could never leave him with someone who doesn't love him! - I know, I know. - Nothing on TV, Tomby? - TV TV! - I could never let him go to Carnavon. - He doesn't let anybody else pop his pimples. - Well, he doesn't! - You're not gonna tell them. - I will, of course. But even if I do, it's me who can't decide, I guess, when it gets right down to it. I just don't think I'll be able to say goodbye to him. - Well, isn't that something? You know what I thought? I thought you didn't want to leave him with your parents. I wonder why I thought that. - Rick. - Because that's what you told me. - I didn't know myself. - Well, I sure knew. Well, this will give me time to think. Let's see, Seattle. - I think you'll really be fantastic there. You love your work so. - Yeah, that's something. This is crazy, you know that? - No, it's not. - It isn't? You want to settle down with your spastic brother instead of with me? Terrific, you two can grow old and fat together. That's not what I want at all! I want you, Rick! - A lie. - I do, but I have, I want Tomby to be a part of that somehow. - He could visit us in Seattle when we get a place. - Not just a visit. - The three of us? The three of us. I'm trying to get some kind of a start, and you want to screw it all up! - I shouldn't have asked you, I'm sorry. - So, now it's up to me, if I love you enough. - No, Rick, that's not the question. - Bathroom bathroom, we do, we do, wee-wee, poop-poop! - Wee or poop, Tomby? Wee or poop? - Poop poop! (eerie electronic music) (dramatic music) (thudding) (screaming) (Tomby crying) - Tomby! Tomby Tom-Tom hurt his hand. Come on, show Sissy, Tomby! Show me, show me, show me, Tomby. Come on, come on, Tomby. Show Sissy, come on. - [Louise] What's the matter? - What did he do? - I don't know. He hurt his hand. - [Louise] Oh? - Come on, Tomby. - [Louise] Is it broken? - [Lloyd] How did he do it? - [Lloyd And Lisa] Come on, Tomby, show Sissy your hand. - Show Sissy, show Sissy. Daddy, get him his chocolate milk. He's not still being punished, is he? - No, no, of course not. - Now, now, Tomby's good. Aww, show Sissy. - Doesn't seem to be any broken bones but I, I can't. - Me me me! - I know, I know, I know! - Here you are, Tomby. - Dad, please bring a cold towel. - He really ought to be x-rayed. - Oh, good, Tomby gets to wear a Band-Aid. - Only if he leaves it alone. - Oh, well, he will, he will. - Band-Aid, Band-Aid, Tomby! - Band-Aid, Band-Aid. - [Louise] He probably won't sleep tonight, Sissy! - Oh, bring him a Thorazine! - [Louise] Alright! - Gay Gay Gay! - Is he home yet? He better be! - [Louise] (shushing) He's asleep! He's asleep with his clothes on, Gay! - [Louise] He was probably tired. - He's probably had a couple of drinks. Gay! - (stammers) Hello, Dad. Your brother's had an accident with his hand. You'd better come out here. Oh, yeah, how'd he do that? - You've been boozing, Gay. - [Greg] Yeah. (laughs) - Oh, Daddy. It's his birthday. Happy Birthday, Gay! - Thank you, Mom. - Not in this house, he can't come in like that. - How many drinks did you have? - Three. - Where'd you get them? - At a bar, it's legal! - You promised me you wouldn't booze. Now, you keep your word when you promise me. I can't get mad at you anymore. You're supposed to be an adult now. - I'm sorry, Dad. Happy birthday, Tombo. - [Lisa] He hurt his hand in the kitchen. - [Greg] What was he doing in the kitchen? - [Lisa] Look on the floor. - I'll clean it up. - Again? That makes some kind of a record, doesn't it? You know, maybe we ought to be trying to find out why he's constantly dumping the contents of the refrigerator on the floor all the time. - I think he does it for attention. - Attention? - Don't you, Ma? - Do think he really needs attention? - Don't yell in front of him. - You know how you find out what he wants? You ask him. - Don't tell me about Tomby, Gay. - Why don't you ask him, Sissy. Maybe he will tell you. - Tell Sissy, Tomby. Tell Sissy. - He did it to feed Pasey Pasey! That damned cat? - Why, yes! That little cat that you had about six years ago. - That little black cat. How about that? - It's amazing he can remember something that long ago. - Yeah. - That darling little black cat. - Fancy that. - Yeah, he killed it. - He didn't mean to. - He kicked it to death! - Well, he doesn't kick anymore, Gay. - He doesn't wear, uh, steel-tipped shoes anymore. - Come on, Tomby, come on. Come on, Tomby. Come on, Tomby, come on. Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. Come on, come on. - (groans) He's been so much better since he's been taking the Thorazine. - Oh, thanks to modern drugs. I wonder what he'd do to that cat if he had it now. - How do you think he'd act, Sissy? - I think he'd be fine. He's much gentler now. Look at him with his flowers! - Flowers don't have eyes you can poke out. - Oh, Gay. I don't think he should have a kitten, a bigger cat, maybe. - [Greg] Yeah, a plastic one. - [Lisa] I think he could have one! - Was that what he was trying to say, Sissy? How could he remember back six years? - [Lisa] It's an incredible memory span. Maybe he's getting better! - Yeah, there aren't many four-year-olds who can remember back six years. - You think it would be alright, Sissy? - [Lisa] Yes! Well, I think if that's what he wants we should try it. - Just get him one, please. - Daddy, what do you think? - If it's alright with Sissy, it's alright with me. - [Greg] Oh, boy, a cat. - I can't wait to see him when we give it to him. Can we get him one tomorrow, Ma, for his birthday? He wanted one and he told us. - [Greg] Good night, good night, good night. - Gay! (coughing) Happy birthday. - Thank you, Mom. - Happy birthday, Gay. - Night, Sissy! - [Lisa] Night, Ma! - Night, Tomby! - Night, Tomby! (Greg coughing) - Happy birthday. - Good night, Sissy. Happy birthday, ya little shithead. We are now 18, in about two hours, two-and-a-half, something. (sighs) Thanks for getting me up. Well, we haven't had much of a chance to talk much over the past 18 years, so can I sit down? (sighs) We are now allowed to vote. We're allowed to drink. We're allowed to be drafted. We're allowed to get married. (laughs) What else? Well, that's enough. We're going to be doing a lot of these things from now on. We've got lots of time. I don't even know what I want to be yet. You've got lots of time, too. And you know what you're gonna be. Happy birthday, kid. You're probably a very heavy guy. (laughs) How would anyone know? Your life is relatively uncomplicated. A good lunch, a good bowel movement and good nap. That's about it, isn't it, Tomasino? Got your room. Got your flower box. You're fed, you're chauffeured. You've got your cars and your animals and your flowers. Anytime you get a little excited, they give you Thorazine. (chuckles) You're all set. You're even on drugs, congratulations. The world's most experienced four-year-old. (sighs) We've never talked, have we? Uh, this, kind of, seems to be the time, I might be taking off. Why not? I gotta get outta here, Tombo. You understand? See, what about me? I never bring my lady friends around here or haven't you noticed? I mean, we're twins. Don't you think I'd like them to meet you? Look at us. I could have been you. Sometimes I think I probably am. I think about that. Well, I'll tell you one thing. When I do come back to visit, I think I might bring one of my lady friends around here and let her see for herself that what I have for a brother is really a broken toy. What the hell. And if she doesn't think you're as beautiful as I think you're beautiful, then the hell with her, right? Am I right? Of course I am, ya little bastard. You're part of me. You know, we have the same eyes? I don't know where we got 'em, but we got 'em. We're the same. Deep. That lady said you had, uh, shadows in your eyes. She was right. Twins Not only are you my twin, you're the only thing holding this chickenshit outfit together. Yeah, yeah, I wonder when the last time was that Mom and Pop really got it on. Years, probably. And Sissy, she lives for you. You've got everyone's number around here don't you, kid? (chuckles) Why don't you let Sissy go, huh Tombo? She'd never leave you. That's why. (chuckles) You're just sittin' there, aren't you? Drinking it all up, not a peep. You don't got nothing to say, don't say it, right? Right. I've been meaning to discuss a couple of these larger issues with you. And one more thing, little guy. If I ever, if I ever do freak out completely and get married to someone, you'll come and live with us sometime. Oh, and if you do, could you please call me Greg? You think you could learn to say that? Doesn't anyone around here know what gay means? (laughing) Yeah. A world without Thomas Jerome would be a very straight place, indeed. Well, that's about all I have to say. Uh. I'm gonna kiss you, little guy. Sleep well. Tomorrow it'll be cars and animals and flowers and who knows, maybe a C-A-T. Good night. Happy birthday, kid. Night. (dramatic, somber music) (upbeat classical music) (phone ringing) - Rick? No, I'm all alone. Oh, he's right here dancing with Ernest. Dancing Poulenc. Ma says it rains a lot in Seattle. Well, I guess she was wrong. I'm glad you're having such good weather up there. Do you feel the same about Tomby? Yes. I know, Rick. Oh. Yes. Goodbye, Rick. (door thudding) (sobbing) (simple organ music) Daddy? Daddy? - Tomby? - I'm alright. - What? - I'm alright. I'm not what you think I am. - Oh, Tomby, what? - I can talk almost right, can't I? - Yes! You, you, you just found out? It just happened? - Yes, I thought you'd be mad. - Mad? Mad at you? Oh, Tomby, God, I'm so happy! - Are you mad? - No, honey, no, I'm not mad. - No? - No, of course not! - You're speaking words! - Yes. - Well, say something! - What? - Say something you couldn't say before. - Lisa, are you happy? - Yes. - Now you don't have to stay. - How did you know? How did it happen? - All I did was I said, "I think I'll get that toothbrush," and, and so I did and I put it in my mouth and my hand moved it the way you move it but it was, it was my hand. It felt right! My, my, my fingers closed and, and they opened and my head moves and my arm. - Tomby, I'm so happy! - It, it just happened, just now when I was on the phone? When did it happen? It wasn't today, was it? Was it yesterday? Last week? Longer than last week? How long, Tomby? - I think it was years. I like my room. I like to live here. I like it the way it is now. I didn't want it to change. - God, Tomby! - [Tomby] Are you going to tell? - Of course! - Please, don't tell them. - You mean, you don't wanna change? - I don't want something else. I don't want to do what Greg does. - But you have to! - [Tomby] Why? - Everybody does. - No, no. I trusted you. You can go marry Rick. You won't be here. That's what you want. - Yes, it is. - Let me stay here the way I am. That's what I want. Please. - All this time. All this time! All this time! Get out, get out, get out! Out! (sobbing) I cannot, I cannot, (sobs) I cannot! (sobs) - Hoo hoo, Sissy, Mom's home! - [Lisa] Hello, Mom. - Hello. Mm-hm. Oh. Oh, I'm so glad they didn't chop all his hair off. Why is he so furious with us for addressing his letters to Private Gay Jerome? Oh, Army regulations, I suppose. Oh my, his handwriting. I'll just have to save this to read later. Was Tomby dancing with you? What did you dance today? Let me guess, Swan Lake? - [Lisa] Ma! - Mm? - What would happen if I did go away? - To Tomby? - Yes! - Oh, Sissy. Why on Earth do you ask a question like that? - What would happen if I wasn't here anymore? - What's wrong, dear? Aww, what have you been crying about? - I've been talking with Rick, that's all, Ma. I'm gonna go away and be with him and we'll get married and I'm gonna go tonight. - Can I borrow this bag? - What? Sissy, darling. Do you, do you want me to believe that you're just going to pick up, fly out of here tonight to be with Rick? Well, I think Rick's a wonderful young man but I didn't think that you were serious about him, now that he's chosen to live in Seattle. - He was sent there, and I am that serious about him. - What are you gonna say to Tomby? I didn't think you ever wanted a stranger to take care of him. Well, that's what's going to happen! Now, you know that! Well, anyway, it's impossible because we're not going to just simply make up our minds that quickly about something that important. So you just calm down, young lady and, and we'll talk it out with your father when he gets home. Don't worry about Rick. He'll still be there. Sissy! Please, come and help me with dinner. Where is Tomby? - [Lisa] Outside! - Sissy, what's wrong with him? Why is he such a mess? Sissy! How did his overalls get torn? Sissy, Sissy! - Let him tell you! - What do you mean? - Tomby's normal! Tomby's been normal for years, Ma! Don't you get it? All this time, washing and feeding and toilet, and everything and he's been normal! Normal, Ma. Ma! - Don't tell your father. - You knew, didn't you? You knew! - Yes. I'm his mother. (eerie music) - Here comes Tomby! (dramatic music) - Hey, thanks Tombo. - [Lloyd] Ma? - I hope that God takes care of Gay wherever he may be sent. - Gay? - Uh, the body has reasons which reason doesn't understand. - [Lloyd] Tomby? - Me me me! - Oh, look what Tomby's got for his dinner, orange potatoes, mmm, num num num num.
