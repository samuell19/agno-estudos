Based on a true story My Paparotti I'm almost there. Yes. Okay, sir. Dragging me out on my day off... Bastard! I'm sorry I wasn't looking. - What the hell? - Hey! Ow, my neck! I'm sure I didn't hit you that hard. What are you, a doctor? With Farah Fawcett hair? Seriously, who wears their hair like that anymore? That's rude coming from someone I just met. Car accidents usually happen between strangers. Isn't that right? I'm in a bit of a hurry now... Do we look like we've got nothing better to do? I'll bury your sorry-ass alive. What's going on? This asshole won't apologize for his bad. Then make him. I'm real sorry about the trouble. This is my insurance number... That's a killer audio system. Much too good for this piece of junk. My spoiler alone is worth more than your car. Get his card and tell him to piss off. Yes, boss. You are almost here? Good. Finally, a break through for this school. The moment I heard his demo, every single hair on my body stood on end. Even in the armpit. A true genius. Wouldn't you agree? Maybe that's bit of an overstatement. But he is quite special. Why are you sending your 'boy wonder' to our school? He got into a little trouble. So, he has to transfer. We're going to welcome him with open arms. Open arms are all good but sir, this will make his fourth transfer. He's been through a lot, that poor boy. He got expelled from your school, didn't he? Well... Here you are! This is Lee Jang-ho. Say hello to your new principal. Morning. Good morning, sir. I mean... Hey! What a good looking fella you are! This is the head of music department. Say hello. Good to see you again. What's going on? You two know each other? Ow, my neck! Something wrong, Mr. Na? I'm suddenly getting a sharp pain in my neck. Why don't you give him a vocal test, Mr. Na? Mr. Lee? What? Yes, boss. I understand. Mr. Na, I'll take the test some other time. I've got urgent business to take care of. Well if you gotta go, you gotta go. Go ahead. Great. One little thing before you go. It's not I'll take the test some other time, but "Could I take the test some other time...?" ...Sir. Okay? Off you go. Sure. Oh, and... Don't worry about the spoiler. Use the money to buy snacks for your kids, okay? That little piece of shit! Mr. Na, can we have a word? Jang-ho left early? He has urgent business and wishes to take it some other time. You need to sort this out. We're the ones that need him. You, me and this school. Why are you always so twisted? Can't you be a little cooperative? You're a staff on the pay roll. So, this isn't your problem. Fine! If you took half the interest you have on anything... Do you want my resignation? Fine. You got it. Damned scumbags! What? This'll fall off any moment. Snack money for kids? Sang-jin! My buddy! Get off me. I'm the principal of this school. I said let go, damn it! And a very persistent man, too. Let go of me! Have a drink. Come on, it's all for the sake of the school. I can't remember the last time we won anything at competition. So, you brought in a thug to sing for the school? When my late father made me principal he said to me, 'Nobility Obliges.' We all gotta do our part for the society. Do you owe him money? Is he threatening you? If only we didn't go to college together... Mr. Na! What, sir? Don't try to boss me around outside of school! I remember how my late father took you under his wings during your worst times. How could I face him if I let the school close down? Give the boy a chance. Please? What the hell? What have we got here? That's some fantastic needle work. Your skirt is so tight that it won't even roll up. How do you walk in it? Very well, actually. Not only do I feel bad for your poor skirt, but also for my eyes for having to put up with this sight. Trouble, trouble... It's you, again. You can't be a human being. How much peroxide do you need to get a color like this? It's discolored from malnutrition. Oh yeah? Look at these bags under my eyes. Is that right? Have it tested at the crime lab. A single strand won't do. They'll need at least a handful of samples. Bring me a pair of scissors! What a sad-looking bunch! Have a good day, boss. That him? I heard a big guy's transferring in. How do you know it's big? I'm not talking about that, silly! What the hell? Why aren't you stopping him? Hey, you! Can you... please come here for a second? Oh God... What's up? You should be wearing a uniform. Right...? And the shoes... You got a problem with my shoes? I'll check the guidelines again. Although, I don't see why they should be a problem. Who's next? Min-seok? Yes, Mr. Na. He dyed his hair, too. What? Tell me, Where do you get your hair done? Is that a tattoo on your face? What the f...? Piss off. Wow, you smell nice. What shampoo do you use? What's going on? Nothing. Maybe he doesn't feel like talking. Is that right? Hey, douche bag! What do you take the school's hardcase for? Hey... I'm talking to you. You're bleeding. No, I'm not. It's nothing. Give us a look. It's gushing out. The damn bell saved your ass, dick! What the fuck are you looking at? Go back to your books, assholes. Why don't you paint the entire school with blood? You got this wrong. He started... I won't hear it. What the hell did you do to your face? This isn't art class. Are you gonna take a swing at me? You little punks. What's this? Snack money. Order yourself a bowl of noodles on me. 30% off. - Your hairdresser...? - Shut up. Fucking hell! Nobody will eat with you because of your stinky temper? Let me join you. I get indigestion from eating with people. Jang-ho hasn't come into school for days. Did you call him? I've been busy. Too busy to carry out your teacher's duties? Fine. I'll call him. Stop acting like you've got ants in your pants and sit down for a moment. Here. This is his address. He lives close by from you. Why don't you pick him up on your way to school? It'll be nice to have someone to keep you company. Think it'll make any difference? He won't change. He's a piece of crap. How can you tell without giving him a shot? Oh, my poor father... your son is treated like a piece of shit by his colleagues. Mr. Na! It's about time you do something for this school. The school doesn't run on air and water. Bring me Jang-ho or your resignation. Something going on between you two? I hear rumors that you've been making out in the school. - That's absurd! - God, no! Turn it off. Why are you sleeping here? I'll go under the bed. Buzz at your own risk? Damn thugs... Scum of society! Man... Oh, fuck it! I don't believe this... Who the fuck is this? Who sent you? A hit man? You got this all wrong. The Fender bender? What's going on? Boss, it's the fender bender punk from the other day. Mr. Na? Mr. Na? Is that his alias? He's my teacher. Your teacher, boss? Good morning, sir. Morning... What brings you here so early? Let's go. Go where? What do you think, you pr...? The school! You changed your ride? - It's not the same junk? - No, it's not. Either woman nor car is not a used one. - See you boys later. - Yes, boss. - Call me if anything happens. - Yes, sir. Have a good day, boss. You upgraded from a wreck to a junk. Let's roll. Have a good day, boss. Piece of shit! Are you done? Yes. What's the title of this song? The Trout. A live trout or a dead one? How would I know? That's what's wrong with you. Is he for real? - Suk-hui? - Yeah? You majored in dance last year, didn't you? Yup. Why did you change to voice this year? Mr. Na, I never knew I would get so big. What will you do next year? Continue singing? Find yourself a husband. Get married and enjoy the life singing and dancing away. Go to your seat. That's all for today. Thank you, Mr. Na. What the hell? Why'd you drag me here, if you weren't gonna teach me anything? Because the principal asked me to. Aren't we gonna train? Would you want to teach a thug if you were me? Do you have to keep calling me a thug? Because you are a thug. Aren't you? Aren't thugs allowed to sing? Classic isn't country music. It's not something you take lightly. I'm not doing it for a laugh. I didn't know that music discriminated. I don't wanna learn from a stuck-up old fart either. 'Old fart'? Fine! Do as you please. A singing thug? Nice! I'd rather scatter manure on those who have potentials. Am I a goddamn carrot? What manure? Rank! Guess what? You're not the only vocal coach around! Did you bring my coupon? No. That's no way to treat a regular customer. You should take pride in your job no matter how trivial it may be. Large portion? Yes, sir. Not a soul to eat lunch with in the entire school. Loner! They bully among teachers, too? How piss weak! It means you don't want anything to do with it. Are you done with the phone call? Nah. I can't get reception in the hall. Who is it this time? Good reception here. Yes, boss. Him again? Now? I'll be right there, sir. Hey! Look at this. This is 100% fake. You shouldn't add tap water to the whiskey that you sell. Because that's wrong. Wrong. Terrible practice. No, no, no! You Are you in charge here? This is your judgment day. Look. I'm calling the cops. Call them. I will. I'm dialing. Do you want me to call for you? Argh! Ow! Argh! Did you see that? Did you see what he did to me? Go on, why don't you kill me? You picked the wrong guy to mess with. Bring it on. Argh! My head! Is this a school or a club? You sent us a thug to work with. Well... For all you know, he could put a knife through me. Will you take responsibility? That's why you should be careful. What the hell, man? Don't come to my funeral! Don't you pay tribute either. Calm down, man. I've got a call coming in. Don't hang up. Gimcheon Arts High. Hello? He got into trouble already. Hello? Lee Jang-ho, student at Gimcheon Arts High... Student by day and a gang banger by night, you must be so busy. He must be your favorite student. Very touching. I'll let him off this time. Thank you, officer. Anyone can study voice these days? Do you need high school diploma to be a gangster these days? That's not why I go to school. Why then? I just love singing. You haven't heard me singing yet. When you become my age, you don't have to taste it to know that shit is shit. I ain't no shit. It's really hot today. Have some cold drink. Thank you, ma'am. What a handsome fella! Mom, is he a gangster? Give us some privacy. Yes Let's get out of here. He's so cool. And handsome, too. What are you going to sing? Anything? Which song? E lucevan le stelle You don't know it? Why don't you pick something you can actually sing? No. It's good. Fine, then. What are you doing? Warming up. And you called me shit. You went to the cop shop? It wasn't shit. Gotta be careful with customers even the most fucked-up ones. If you get kicked out of school again... I'm sorry, boss. Did he make you stand in the corner? Actually, he must be troubled by now. You little piece of shit! He's quite a singer, isn't he? Be a man and give him some credit that he deserves. Let me eat in peace! But you are eating it. Gangster tenor flipping rocks! Language! Don't eat all of that. Can you share? I asked you to make it. So, it's mine. from the country boy to the hero of the Carnegie Hall Gimcheon Arts High School. One moment, please. Mr. Na, it's for you. Mr. Na? Yes? It's the Daegu Singing Competition wanting to speak to the head of music. Hello. Na speaking. Lee Jang-ho? How dare he do this to me! Hey! Daegu Competition! Deok-saeng! Come here, you! Jang Deok-saeng! You signed him up. Shouldn't you be in the class, Mr. Na? You wrote a goddamn recommendation for him. You mean Daegu Competition? Without consulting with me first! How dare you take me for shit? Did Jang-ho make it to the main competition? Good for him! Damn you! Come here, you. Shouldn't you get busy now? What? You've got no time to waste. He really keeps on impressing you, doesn't he? - I said come here. - Come on, buddy. What? Did you get my text message? - What message? - Class reunion tomorrow night. Let's talk about this tomorrow, okay? Urgh! Lee Jang-ho! It's eel rice. You know what it's good for? I'm allergic to eels. Are you embarrassed? I know you're lying because you're embarrassed. What...I What do you stutter? I didn't. Piss off when I tell you nicely. Are you nervous to be in a confined space with me? I said piss off. Why would I? Desperate to see blood? So tough yet incredibly talented. What do you think about me? Wh...what? You're doing it again. For fuck's sake! Keep on with the good work. Go, Jang-ho! Is she out of her fucking mind? Cheers! Cheers. You'll be lonely in Italy. I've made arrangements for that. You never disappoint me. Thanks, man. How was the Carnegie Hall recital? Great venue, eh? Acoustics are amazing. The sound travels so powerfully. It's a truly wonderful venue. Wonderful Carnegie! Wonderful! That's fucking beautiful. Do you want me to fix you a drink? Forget it. Sang-jin was truly wonderful. Getting an offer from the Italian opera company and all. Hey! Your way of jeering, doesn't it ever bother you? You two have been like this since college days Why don't we try to be friends now? I heard you're teaching now. In the countryside. I don't know if you can handle that. - Come on, man. - Such a promising star you were and you ended up in the middle of nowhere. Are you so proud of the tenure you bought off with money? If it wasn't for the throat tumor, things would've turned out quite differently. It could've been 'perfecto.' Perfect, my ass! Yes, boss. Yes, sir. I'm out taking care of some business. Yes, sir. The big boss wants you. Really? I'll be on my way. Who did this? Him? This kid did this to all of you? Why don't you take him under your wing? Did you eat? Come on. What do you feel like? Have you thought this over? Yes, I did. Will I stay in a camp with the brothers? When you're all by yourself, it gets so quiet that you can't sleep. There were times when I didn't utter a single word for three days. Three days? You can't just talk to yourself, can you? You've got no siblings? I've been living alone since gran died. Well, think it over carefully once again. It might seem all good now but death is the only way out. Boss, I saw it on TV. They all wear black for competitions. How about this, boss? I got the bow tie. I got it off one of the waiters. Nice, eh? Are you fucking kidding me? Who wears stuff like that these days? That Permarotti-guy you like, he wears a bow tie all the times. How many times do I have to tell you? It's Pavarotti, not Parmarotti. Learn what you don't know. Learn, man. Wasn't he called Permarotti because of his permed hair? Come on, man. Go, boss! Who are these people? If it wasn't for these fucked up threads. Shiny silver, damn it. Chicken feet and a bottle of soju, please. Yes,Sir. Keep your chin up. What the hell? I'm still your teacher. Put that bottle away. Here. I don't eat chicken feet. There are things you can't eat? It's nasty. You're the nasty one. Embarrassed, right? You thought you'd win something easily. And here you are, empty handed. You and your ridiculous silver suit. What kind of a classical vocal performer doesn't have a tux? It should be about your skills, not stupid suits. Don't talk about skills, when you can't even stand straight As if you ever taught me howl Did you come at the competition? Man, my tongue's on fire. To check out your shitty student? You were shit alright. Your enunciation and emotional expression were just shit. Your singing is nothing more than mimicking. Like a parrot. Nobody is picture perfect. How can I know when I haven't been taught? I have no business teaching the unwilling. Then, teach me. Good. I'm confiscating this. No, not that, it cost me a fortune. Quit smoking, dumbass. What kind of singer smokes cigarette? Jang-ho, if you're gonna do this, do it right. Alright? Where are you going? To take a leak, asshole. Are we late? Not yet. Then, why are we running? Because they're running, too. Why are they running? I don't know. What is this? You started running first. Hey, it's your lover boy. He must have had a change of heart. He's wearing his uniform. Duck boat ride this weekend? Forget duck boat. Let's gets some roast duck. Oh my God! Morning. Are you crazy? That prick... - Jin-ju. - Yeah? Schubert wrote this piece after watching trouts playing merrily. It mustn't be sung heavily. Not like frozen fish. Pollacks usually come frozen. Which is your fish? A fresh, succulent one full of vigor... Enough talks of sashimi. Focus on your trout, okay? Yes, Mr. Na. Do you want to stop? Yes, Mr. Na. When I look at your gesture and emotional expression you're a budding prima donna. What's this song called? 'Forbidden song.' Singing is forbidden for you from this moment. Because you can't lip sync arias. What's your dream? Getting married. I figured. Go on get married. Sooner the better. Back to your seat. Remember, you're forbidden from singing from now. Lee Jang-ho. Yes? Aren't you going to sing? Excuse me? Aren't you going to sing? I am, I am. What were you looking at? At the sheet music. You can't read music? Scooch on over. Are you kidding me? Closer. What will you do for me if I teach you how to read music? Um... dinner? What do you want? That thing that you're thinking about right now. I wasn't thinking anything. Don't be naive. I'll teach you for free. Watch carefully. G B D F So le ti fa Great Big Dogs Fight. Fight what? That's how you memorize it. G B D F 'Great Big Dogs Fight.' Okay. - Got it? - I got it. - And A C E G? - What's that? All Cows Expel Gas. 'All Cows Expel Gas.' Do I have to explain again? You said you got it. Alright. Alright. What's this? 'Great Big Dogs Fight.' What? G B D F And this? 'All Cows Expel Gas.' A C E G Do you have to do that thing? I got that right though. You've done some work. I can do anything once I put my mind to it. It's not that hard. No, it's not. Hello, sir. It's nice to see you work together. - Mr. Na. - Yeah? Does he have potential? - Sure does. - Is that right? Have a look at this, Jang-ho. What's that? This flyer? Flyer... right. It's about the most prestigious singing competition. Sejong Competition. Awesome. Are you interested? Wanna go for it? - Me? - Yes, you. - Sir, - Come out here, sir. may I have a word with you? Outside? Let's talk here. It's hot out. A word, please? No need for the serious face. It's boiling hot outside. I'm telling you I want to discuss something with you. Alright. Hey! What kind of monkey business are you trying to pull? Come on, you know what I want. I want him to win the grand prize and help restore the school's reputation. - Grand prize, huh? - Yeah! The boy can't even read music. That's only a minor problem. What's the title of a Tom Cruise movie? - Tom Cruise? - Yes. - Mission Impossible? - Come again? Mission impossible. That's what this is. A mission impossible. That's why your contribution is crucial. Come on. This is a mission impossible. Down to the letter. Why don't you do it yourself? Father, this school you built with your bare hands it's about to go to pieces thanks to your protégé. Will you stop dropping the father card? Mr. Na, it's all on your shoulders now. I'm counting on you, man. Take a look at the flyer. I mean, the pamphlet. Hey! Damn you... I said no making out in the school premises. We weren't. Never mind. Just continue. But we weren't doing anything! Only the best budding vocalists will sing at this competition. I understand how you feel but don't bite off more than you can chew. Well, bring on the challenge. Do you really want to be in this competition? Yes. What will you sing? 'Nessun Dorma' Is there a problem? Can you hit high C? The soda? No, not the soda brand! You've got to be able to hit high C in order to sing that song. I'm gonna sing it anyway. Why don't we pick something else? No. I want 'Nessun Dorma.' Why? Because I have to. When I was little, I lived with my grandmother. People used to call me a genius when they heard me sing. Gran was so proud of me, too. I had this CD that I won as a prize. I loved it so much and that's how fell in love with opera. That song was 'Nessun Dorma.' Nobody cared when my gran died. But when Paparotti died, it was on the news everywhere. They played his rendition of 'Nessun Dorma' all day. That's when I told myself that I'll become a tenor just like him and sing 'Nessun Dorma' on a big stage. Such a pain in the ass. Of all good songs out there... You alright, Mr. Na? I'm not, you prick. Am I your chauffeur? If you don't want to look like an idiot at the competition, you're gonna have to work your ass off. Yes, sir. Drop the nasal voice, for God's sake! Are you trying to be a country singer? I'm sorry, boss. - What? - I mean, sir. Again from the beginning. Yes, boss. Motherfuckers! Christ! I almost crashed, you bastard. Did we crash? Are you trying to be a climber? Use minimal gesture to convey emotion. This much? That's kneading. Where are you going every weekend? Are you seeing someone else? Hello? Lee Jang-ho Do you know what 'vincere' means? Victory. You know the meaning of that word and that's all you can manage? Is it good? Yes, ma'am. It can't be. Shall I try that again Paparotti style? I can sound exactly like him. Who's Paparotti? Your father? It's 'Pavarotti,' you idiot! Pavarotti...? Are you trying to get yourself killed? Excuse me! Forget Pavarotti or Paparotti. Forget Domingo. Find your own voice. Lee Jang-ho's own unique sound. Your songs sound all the same whether it's a love song or a sad song. There is no emotion in your songs. Parting, love... How am I supposed to know what that feels like? Let's start with romance. I made a selection taking into account your intellectual level. My intellectual level? Elementary school boy. Forget it. I'm not watching it. I'm a scumbag. The worst scumbag. I'm a scumbag. The worst scumbag. Is he a true gangster or what? Man, he's killing me. I know this song. 'The one who gives me happiness' How do you know it? It's an old song. It's my dad's favoring song. - Really? - Yeah. If I'm on the way tough and far I'd like to go with you Here we go. All the way to the end! 'Four go'! You rock, man. Dad, you're screwed. It could've been worse. I'll take the chicken head. Yes! A joker! Looking good. That's the way to go. Just one more. I collect two cards from you. I'm saved. Just one more. You're dead, dad. Jang-ho, have some fruit. I'm good. Thanks, man. You don't like fruits? I eat plenty at the club. You little piece of crap! Don't talk about clubs in front of the kid! This is bullshit! What? What! Gambling's bad. Do you know how much you just blew? Go to your room, Ji-min. What a grudge! How dare you ignore my call? You don't care to live anymore? I'm so sorry, boss. I'm making an exception for you so you can have a school diploma. Get your shit together. Before I put an end to it all. Don't make me tell you again. I quit. For singing. It's a tuxedo. For what I owe you from the card game the other night. This rag? It's fine Italian tailoring, dumb ass. - Italian? - Yes. Is this your old tux? Try it on. Well, if you've got no money to pay me... Forget it. - I'm joking, man. - You ungrateful brat... How do I look? It's perfect. It's a perfect fit. As if it was made to my measures. Try moving your arms around. What's the matter? Nothing. Ow! Did you have a fight? I said it's nothing. This fits really well. Cool. Is this a regular house call? I'll cut to the chase. Please let Jang-ho go. You took a lot of trouble coming here. Have a drink on me. Let me know if you want girls. If Jang-ho owes you money, I'll pay it back. In installments if that's okay. Did you say you work in Gimcheon? Country school teachers probably can't afford to drink here. Drop by with your colleagues some time. Gimcheon has plenty of bars, too. Not that I ever go there. What it cost you to feed and raise him, I'll pay it all back. You're a funny man. How come I only had assholes for my teachers? Enough of this now. Does this look like an orphanage to you? Get out of here while I ask you nicely. You're making a big mistake. Jang-ho shouldn't be wasting... He shouldn't be working here. Didn't you hear what I said? I need to be able to play the piano for living. So, I'll need my hands. But you can take one of my feet, if you have to. Please... Let him go. I beg you. Chang-su! Don't touch me. Hey! I'm not done here. Mr. Na, did you have a fight? Did you do your practice? What happened to your hand? A grownup going around having a fight? Shut up. Start with the vocal exercise. They'll say I'm a bad influence. Yes, boss. I'll call you right back... Turn off the damn phone! Do you like living like that? Student by day, gangbanger by night. Do you like living a joke of a life? What's wrong with you, man? Did you have a fight with Mrs. Na? Which one shall I sing today? I'm in tip top condition. People don't avoid you thugs because they're scared. They avoid you because you're stinking filthy scumbags. Come on, man. What's gotten into you? Ask anybody. Ask what they think of you people? You extorting, pathetic low-lives! You don't know what you're talking about. Nobody cared how I lived. Did the school care? Teachers? Hell no. The only ones that cared were my family. My brothers! Chang-su is more than a real brother to me. If you're serious about singing, you gotta clean up first. Even if you sing in your fancy tux and win awards, all people will see is a thug. Why would you care? As long as I get you the damn trophy. What? Isn't that why you took me in in the first place? 'Get me the trophy?' 'Get me the trophy?' You fucking asshole! I treated you like a human being and you think you're all that? Even if you get that trophy, what good will it be? You gotta be a man before anything. Fine. I quit. You fucking bastard! I'm done. I'm outta here. I don't owe you shit. Go to hell! Keep on with the good work. Thank you, boss. - About the Dong-seong district... - Yes, sir. There seems to be a lot of noise. Until either we or Suseong clan moves out... Why should that be us? Take care of the problem. Take Jang-ho with you. Yes, sir. Good. Enjoy your evening, boss. Is it good? It's just a burger. Lift your chin up. Jang-ho Who looks like the biggest sorry ass here? It's me. What are you blathering about? I've got no dream. What I want to do in a year's time... Forget a year, I don't know what I want to do tomorrow. If I had a talent like yours, I wouldn't be living like that. Kid, take the school seriously. Listen to your teachers. I'll kill you if you get kicked out again. I'm done with school. I'm gonna concentrate on work. Wearing a school uniform didn't make me a student. Your pretty ass looks best in uniform. Who are you calling a pretty boy? Jang-ho, your teacher came by to see the big boss. He said that you need to continue studying. He offered to give up his foot in exchange for letting you leave the family. Don't come to the club for a while. Focus on the studies, alright? Boss. Are we all here? Yes, sir! - Shall I call Jang-ho? - Don't worry about it. Let's get the job done and go for a drink, okay? Yes, sir! Let's go. Boss! Hold tight. Are you okay, boss? Hang on. You son of a bitches! This way, boss. Take Chang-su and get the hell out of here. Get the car. You alright, bro? Hang in there, man. Okay? Boss! Will you stop making a fuss? I've been hit before. Give me a cigarette. Bro, you must be feeling alright talking and laughing and all. I thought you quit smoking. You little lying prick. Does that really matter now? Stop talking, man. Look where you're going, dumb ass. Alright. Alright! Let's get you a few pretty stitches and go for a burger. What do you say? Fuck...I Forget burger. Let's go for a drink just the two of us. Remember what I said to you? Live your life. Don't waste it like I did. Alright...? Bro! Bro! Bro! Man... the things you'll make me do. I never went out and bought soup even when my wife was sick. Who asked you to? Shut up. Have some soup. Before it gets cold. Even a little bit. Come on. Mr. Na, Yeah? Do you think I have a shot? Even a thug like me. If I do this singing right, do you think I can have a decent life? Listen to me carefully, Jang-ho. Do you remember the first time I heard you sing? Do you know why left the room without a word after I heard you? I felt envious. I felt so envious that I could die. Your voice, it's a god-given gift. I could never be half as good as you if I tried. I can tell you with all confidence, you'll be a world-class tenor. Are you sure? Jang-ho, take off your gangster suit and put on the tux. That's your destiny. This is the first time that anybody said anything like that to me. No one ever said anything like that to me before. Thanks, Jang-ho. I'm sorry. And thank you. Have you lost your mind? After all that I did for you... You want to walk out on me? You ungrateful son of a bitch! What are you gonna do with that? Stab me? No, sir. I'd rather die here. Is singing more precious that your life? Yes, sir. I won't hold it against you if you killed me right here and now. But if you tell me to stay here and continue living this life, then I think I will despise you. What? You want me to kill you? If that's what you want. Where do you want to be buried? Answer me! Go. If you fail to make something of yourself in 10 years, then I'll have your head and the foot of that teacher of yours. It's not me that's letting you walk. You owe it to Chang-su. I can't remember the last time we were in the main competition. Good morning, sir. Morning. Mr. Na, you have really hit it big. - Are you getting any feelings? - For what? The grand prize. - Good morning, sir. - Morning. Hey, you two! I'm talking to you, lovebirds. Yes, sir. We should all be there, too. It's not like we have nothing better to do... Are you referring to me? Of course not, sir. Of course, we should all be there. Off you go again. Yes, Go... on your way. How can he catch me every single time? Why are they going in opposite directions? Don't worry. They'll meet around the back. She's too good for him. You think so? Draw a deep breath. And start. I think I figured out how to hit high C. Do you want to hear it again? That's okay. From now on, don't sing unless you're paid. It's not a sound that just anybody can make. Nor is it something you can hear anywhere. You and I are so much alike. We like the same food and have the same hobby. Isn't that right? What's your hobby? Go-stop card game. Paper, rock, scissors! Alright! Here I go. Ow, owl You had two bowls of rice, didn't you? Go and nail it. The competition. Lee Jang-ho's own vincere? When you find that, that'll be your true victory. Yes, sir. Yo, vincere! You should never use your fist again. Alright? I'll bet everything I've got on that you'll make a living with your voice. How much is that? Don't go into details, dumb ass. That wasn't bad. Let's try that one more time. Ready? Mr. Na, I need to go. Wait. Out of the way! Phew... Splash! Ew! That was close. Is that you, Jang-ho? Who's that? It's your principal, that's who. Hello, sir. Tomorrow's the big day? Yes, sir. Give it your best shot like you're doing now. Yes, sir. Take what Mr. Na says into your heart. I am, sir. Harder than you're doing now. Yes, sir. He's a genius. Really? He won the Sejong Competition when he was younger and won a scholarship to study in Italy. He even landed primo uomo in a Puccini production. No way! If he didn't suffer from vocal cord tumor, he would've had an incredible career. The song he was going to sing at his grand debut was 'Nessun Dorma.' That's why you're his dream. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes, sir. - Jang-ho... - Sir? Thanks for being here. Do you have some toilet paper in your cubicle? I may have been here too long. Will you pass it to me? Over or under? Perhaps under the partition... Ow! Damn you, boy! Yes, Mr. Na. Tuxedo? I'm in my school uniform. Just kidding! I'll be there on time. Where is the bouquet? - Here. - Why did you leave it on the floor? - God, I am so nervous. - What are you, his wife? Where do you think you're going? After tearing my club down to pieces you've given up fighting? What's this? Are you planning to debut as a country singer? Teacher? You go to school? What's a thug gonna do with an education? I'll educate you with my foot! Come on, pick up the phone... Son of a bitch! No one so far has been as good as Jang-ho. Of course not. You talk as if you're his mother. When is he going to be on? The person you're calling is not available... Will you please let me go? You're not using your fist anymore? Let's see how long you'll hold out. I really gotta be somewhere, okay? Will you let me go, for fuck's sake!? What in God's name...? How could you do this to me? Nah, you got it wrong. I wasn't fighting. I didn't throw a punch. I got beat up pretty bad. But I kept my belly covered so that I could sing. It's over, isn't it? What am I gonna do? There'll be the final deliberation shortly. Excuse me! Sir, madam... My student arrived a little late because something happened. Can he please have his go? Deliberation is almost over. - I understand... - Better luck next time. But he worked really hard for this competition. If you could just take a few minutes... Security! Please come with us. - Just a minute. - Come on. He put so much work into preparing for today. I know I shouldn't do this but please give him a chance. Let's go. - Just one chance, please. - Come with us. Let me talk to the judges for a second. Please, I'm begging you. What is he, a thug? - Please! - Come with us, sir. I said let me go, damn it! All I'm asking is 5 minutes of your time. - You see... - Get him out of here. It's not about the award. - Just give him a chance. - Come on. All he wants is a chance to sing on this stage. Damn you, people! It's not about the award. All he wants is a chance to sing on this stage. All you've got to do is hear him sing. You can keep the damn trophies to yourselves. What he wants is the chance to sing here. - Please give him a chance. - That's enough. Jang-ho! Did you bring the noodles? Since you came all the way out here, I'll give you 3 extra. Take them. Come back in an hour for the bowls. You alright? I can take a punch. I'm not talking about your body. The competition, idiot! Regulation is a regulation. I got there late. Still, the douche bags that won anything won't be smiling when they know who the real winner is. Retard! That's why you're the way you are. Look at the rag you made out of this fine tux. Relax. I'll be wearing it to school instead of the uniform. Pronto. Pronto? Hey! It's me, Sang-jin. What got you to call me? I wanted to apologize for the last time. The reunion? What have you got to apologize for? I have a favor for you. There is this kid... Man, I don't get you. It's an opportunity to kill for. I've never been on a plane. Then, take the damn boat. I get seasick. Damn you! Stop throwing things at me. I got the paperwork ready. End of discussion. I said I'm not going. Go swim in the big water, you shortsighted prick! But there is nobody there. In Italy, I mean. Nobody to drive me to school or smack me in the head and nag at me endlessly. I'll be all on my own. You dumb piece of shit! You won't do that one little thing to make me happy? You won't let me have the pleasure of telling the world that I made a world-class tenor out of my protégé? Mr. Na, What? do you think I can make it? There'll be gifted singers from all over the world. Jang-ho, didn't I tell you that I can put all my money on you? Let's sing a song together before you go. Will this be the last lesson? School's out. If I'm on the way tough and far I'd like to go with you If the morning sun rises in our way I'd like to tell you I'm happy I've looked around enough to know It's with you that I am happy I'm not the kind of girl that gets in the way of a man. I'll be sending you on your way happily. Really? Cool. Thanks. Can I wait for you? Don't. Why not? I gotta do my military service when I get back. I'll wait that out, too. Well, if you can't help it. Jang-ho - What? What are you doing? From this moment, you're mine. Got that? What are you doing here in a sacred ground of learning? - Shit. - Run! Where are you headed? You basters! This is the school premise. Come and help me with gardening. Give me a hand. Jang-ho, when you get on the plane, you gotta sit in the front. That way, you get served first and you can take the best seat. Okay. And don't forget to take off your shoes. You have to take off your shoes? You didn't know that? Man, how are you going to survive in a foreign country? I was only kidding. Did you think I wouldn't know that? If there is something you need, don't think about calling me. I want you to figure it out on your own. I'll call Mrs. Na. Enough now. Get out of my sight. Sure. Go on. It never ends! Damn you! 7 years later I have a good eye for talent. Just not the patience. Why couldn't I wait it out? Maybe I'll give it another go. Encore! My heart... Are you okay, sir? Shall I call 114? It's 911, idiot! Just be quiet for a second. It's really pulling at my heartstrings. Watching him perform on stage after all these years. Bravo, Lee Jang-ho! Why did you bring a bouquet? It's much more sophisticated to throw a single rose. Jang-ho like things in bulk. Shush! Quiet. It's the curtain call. A competition was held here a long time ago. And there was a man who created a scene throwing a tantrum trying to give his protégé a chance to sing. I wouldn't be standing here tonight if it wasn't for that crazy man. My music teacher. Lastly, I would like to sing my favorite song. If I'm on the way tough and far I'd like to go with you If the morning sun rises in our way I'd like to tell you I'm happy I've looked around enough to know It's with you that I am happy You're the one that gives me happiness Even if I'm on the way tough and far You're the one that gives me happiness Even if I'm on the way tough and far You're the one that gives me happiness You! If sometimes I'm on the way boring and lonely I'd like to go with you If sometimes I'm on the day letting me smile I'd like to tell you I am happy I've looked around enough to know It's with you that I am happy You're the one that gives me happiness Even if I'm on the way tough and far You're the one that gives me happiness Even if I'm on the way tough and far You're the one that gives me happiness Even if I'm on the way tough and far You're the one that gives me happiness If I'm on the way tough and far I'd like to go with you If the morning sun rises in our way I'd like to tell you I'm happy I've looked around enough to know It's with you that I am happy You're the one that gives me happiness Even if I'm on the way tough and far You're the one that gives me happiness
