TOHO Co. Ltd. What are you doing here again? Come on. Let's go home. Sister. - Takeshi! He was at the pachinko parlour again. Takeshi, you did something bad in kindergarten again didn't you. - l didn't do anything. - Liar! l know he did something. l just took him there. This happens because you've spoiled him. l hate to think what it will be like making this little devil into an adult. lf you're bad all the time, you'll end up like your uncle, behind everyone else. Try it, it's good. lt's good for you, too. I don't like it. Then give it to me. She just can't do it with that kid her husband left behind. There's no way she can get married again. You don't have kids. You don't understand. Kids are cute. HIT AND RUN Cast: Hideko Takamine Y么ko Tsukasa Eitar么 Ozawa Daisuke Kat么 Hisashi Nakayama Toshio Kurosawa Natsuko Kahara Kumeko Urabe Yoshio Inaba Takeshi Kat么 Yoshio Tsuchiya Directed by Mikio Naruse Senmei. From now on... Yamano Motors will become a leader in engine production. You did a great job at the August meeting. Thank you. No, l'm the one who should be giving thanks. Take your wife to a hot-spring resort and relax for a while. l think you need a little rest yourself. When we announce this, other firms will be shocked. Put in a call to the President in New York. We have to tell him. And when they hear the news, we'll probably have no problem getting lnternational Motors and East Eikei on our side. For the ad campaign, what do you say we link up the Blue Star with the Gemini rocket? What about Kinuko? Oh. Where did she go? Yes. She had a meeting about the Yayoi Club bazaar. She's gone to Gakushin University. The little guy? He's playing in the garden. We'll be going to Hakone for a few days. Yes, we'll take Kenichi with us. Yes. We're finally done with the job we've been working on. When she gets home, tell her to get ready. Yes. Yes. lf l go, l won't be able to see you for at least three years. Don't go. Think of me. ls there a Kakinuma here? There's a telephone call for you. Your husband called and said that he's taking you and Kenichi to Hakone. Yes. l told him that you had a meeting at the Gakushin bazaar. l see. Thank you. Yes. l'll be home within an hour. Hello, Dad. - Hi there. Welcome back. Let me go. l have to go home. lt's always the same. What am l supposed to do? You and l will never be anything more than this. That's why l'm going to go to New York. This is just the right time to change jobs. What do you mean ''just the right time? '' l'm far away from you, l can forget you. You can just think of all this as never having happened. What's wrong with going on the way we are? That would be fine for you probably, but l'm sick of playing around. l'm not playing around. lf that's true, then you should break with your life as it is. Are you telling me l should leave my husband? Aren't you embarrassed to be doing things like this? l have a child, you know. Children have their own lives to live. You can only say that because you're young. After ten years, you won't even look at me anymore. Women get old. When men get old, they get more distinguished, but women just get ugly. Susumu-san, are you going to dump me? How can l tell you so you'll understand? l like you. That isn't going to change now. lt's OK. Why did you keep going? Because l'm with you. l don't think it's serious. l'm sure it'll be alright. Welcome home. Dear... - What's wrong? l think l ran over a kid. A kid? Was he hurt? l don't know. There was blood on the fender. And you just... l didn't stop. 430 yen. That makes 570 yen in change. Thank you. Thank you very much. Sister, Takeshi got hit by a car. Takeshi?! Yes. They've taken him to Dowa Hospital. They want you to come right away. l'll go to the scene of the accident. What do you think? Will you turn yourself in to the police? l don't think l'd do something so dirty at any other time, but, Since l have an important position in the company and she's my wife, for her to have run over a child in an accident would not only affect the trust that people have in the company, but also the life of our new product. This is the most critical period. Sir, since l learned to drive thirteen years ago, l haven't had a single accident. That's why l'm asking you. They'll be easy on you. l'll give you a company lawyer, too. So you don't want to do it? Don't cry. What's that going to do? Sir, there are certain conditions. Tell me what they are. l'm supposed to retire next year. l'd like to have a job at the company as long as l live. Of course. l got married in 1937. l was twenty-six. The next year l was drafted. l was in Manchuria when the war ended. l was taken prisoner and sent to Siberia. l was in the mountains somewhere near Moscow for four years. l was a soldier for twelve years in all. When l finally made it back to Japan, l was a middle-aged man of forty. Enough. l shouldn't have asked you. That's not what l'm saying. l still have to work. l want money and l want a job. lf you can give me that, l'll go and turn myself in in place of your wife. Madame! Takeshi! What do you get? - Seven metres, twenty. Get out. He came in and confessed. - Came in and confessed? You're the guy who killed Takeshi! You! l'm going to kill you! Madame. Yes? You have a phone call from Ogasawara-san. - Thank you. Hello. lt's me. Did you see the newspaper? Newspaper? The kid died. Died? The person who confessed was your driver, Sugai, wasn't he. What's going on? Never mind that. You don't have to worry. l'll talk about it when we meet. Don't you know better than to call here? l'll get in touch with you. But you really don't have to worry. Well, l'll talk to you later. Good morning, mama. Good morning. Where are the papers? Your husband took them all. MODEL DRIVER IN HIT AND RUN ACCIDENT PERFECT DRIVING RECORD FOR 13 YEARS LITTLE TAKESHI DIED OF CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGING This looks like it might get complicated. - What might? l was just talking to lmanishi, the lawyer. The kid's mother works in a restaurant in Chinatown. She fainted when she saw her dead child. She was standing on a concrete floor when it happened. She hit her head hard and suffered serious injuries. That's terrible. He's talking to mother's younger brother about compensation and damages, but he said this younger brother is like a yakuza. A million yen? Yes. And of course, that would be apart from the expenses and mental anguish. for his mother's hospital stay and treatment. This would be a simple payment for damages and mental anguish. Lawyer. - Yes? You're not too familiar with civil suits are you? What do you mean by that? Don't kid around. The guilty party is an employee of Yamano Motors. We can sue him - and the company president, too. Are you sitting there letting me talk because you're going to say ''no'' anyway? No, that's not true at all. When a child under the age of six is killed by a car, the maximum amount the driver's insurance company will pay in damages is five hundred thousand yen. So, the kids life is worth 500,000 yen? That's what the law says. Well, then why are you messing around here? Look, why don't you just tell me exactly how much you want. Thanks. She just went to sleep. - Has her condition stabilised at all? She's been yelling ''l want to die, l want to die! '' and she tries to strangle herself with her own hands. l just got kicked trying to stop her. Thanks. Koji! No, no. You mustn't get up. You have to take it easy. Takeshi is crying. He's saying ''lt hurts! lt hurts! '' Nurse, sorry, but would you mind stepping out for a moment? Go ahead, but don't try to talk to her about anything too complicated. The boss from Yamano Motors brought this over. They said they wanted to apologise to you. Do you want to meet them? l'm going to go home. l'm fine. No. No, you can't do that. You must stay in here for about a week. Sometimes people with head injuries get worse after the accident. You don't have to worry about money. But what about the rest of this business? The payment for damages for example. Money won't do a thing. Yeah, but crying isn't going to bring Takeshi back to life, either. You should try to get as much money as you can out of those people. l don't know anything about those kinds of thing. So why did you drive away from the accident? l don't know myself. There was a big bump, and l was frightened. l stopped as soon as l could, but when l looked back, the child got up and took a few steps so l thought it wasn't so serious. When l got back, though, l noticed blood on the fender and l thought this is serious. Got up and took a few steps? - Yes. Don't kid around. Hayashi-san lend me your ink-pad, will you? Thanks. l finally got it settled. 1 ,200,000 yen, plus the mother's medical expenses. Yes. l don't think there'll be any problems later. Well, if we can wrap up a settlement now, we'll have an advantage in Sugai's trial. Well, thanks for your efforts. l'll hand over the money tomorrow in cash. Yes. That's no problem. Yes, please. Thanks. The settlement is done. lf everything goes right, Sugai will probably get off with just a fine. But l want you to stop driving. He was only five, the same as Kenichi. Mama, why don't you ride in cars? l will now give the decision. The accused shall pay a fine of 30,000 yen. This is to be paid within three years of the completion of this trial and shall be paid out of the accused's own funds. A fine. 30,000 yen. lf you're such a smart one, say it again. - Yes, say something. Say something! What's going on? He called me a whore. Well, you lost the war. Let's push him in the ditch! Let's! Let me go! Let me go! Let him go! Let me go! Let me go! Oh my! lsn't this cute? Why are you buying things like that? He hasn't even opened his eyes yet. When he gets bigger, how about making him a ballplayer? That won't work. Well, how about a boxer? Dear, for the longest time, l thought that there weren't any gods, but there are. Why do you say that? Because they made a person like me happy. Sis... What are you doing? Nothing. Nothing? lt looks like you've turned to stone. The trial was today. Trial? What happened to that guy? What happened? lt was a 30,000 yen fine. Killed someone even. lf all you have to do is pay a 30,000 yen fine, l'll run him over. Let it go, sister. We've been ignored by the heavens ever since we were kids. l'm different from you. l'm not a yakuza. That's true. You're a good person. Since the old man and the old lady died in that air raid, you've been living with this yakuza brother of yours and working your fingers to the bone. When you married Bannai-san, l thought the gods had rewarded you for all that. Bannai-san was a good guy, wasn't he. You even had a child with him. But just when you thought you'd found happiness, Bannai-san died in that accident sterilising the ship. And then Takeshi got run over and died. There aren't any gods. That's right. There are just lucky people and unlucky people like us. l don't want to live in this world any more. But you can't just kill yourself either. Why don't you get married again. You're still pretty. Koji! Sis, that's enough, let's go home everyone. Shut up! Be quiet. Bartender, give me some more sake. One more bottle. Give some to him, too. What should we sing next? How about ''A Woman's Heart?'' lf you want to go home, go home by yourself. l want to have more fun. You have fun, and some more, and then you die! - l know, l know. - Shut up! Play your guitar for me. You're that child's mother. Thank you very much for what you did. Thank you. - No, it was nothing. - Let me treat you. - No. You don't have to do that. l have money, you know. l came into some money, you know. Bartender, give us some more sake. The best stuff - and lot's of it. - Yes, yes. She lost a child, hit by a car. lt was her only child. Only child? Come on, you. Watch yourself. That's really awful. l saw it happen. - Was it a truck? No, just a private car. Women shouldn't be driving cars. A woman? Don't talk such foolishness! The guilty party confessed and the trial is over. You guys got a lot of money in the settlement, too. You might not believe us, but there's a witness. A witness? That's crazy. Women who have their children taken from them are crazy. Where were you looking from? From right about here. The car went by the gate pretty fast. Can you really tell the difference between a woman and a man in a car going so fast? There's nothing wrong with my eyes! - Couldn't you be imagining this? - That's what l thought at first, but... You can't be so vague. We need proof. Proof! Didn't you say that she was wearing a black and white striped scarf? A man might wear a striped scarf. - That's true. - So which is it? She says she can't sleep at night. l'll prescribe some sleeping pills. You can come and pick them up later. Take care. Last night she collapsed all of a sudden. She said that her chest was tight. But there isn't anything especially wrong with her. GAMBLE YOUR LlFE lN THE MOMENT lt seems that our new product has caught the attention of the police. The police? Yes, they say that it goes too fast. Of course it was a bad thing, but it's over with. You certainly wouldn't be going to New York, and thinking of leaving me would you? Yes. lf that's the case, it's fine with me. But please see me again. l told you it's over with. So you're telling me to confess? Why are you following me? Please. Please investigate one more time. The person who ran over Takeshi was a woman. l know how you feel, but even that witness said she wasn't sure. The striped scarf. The person who ran your son over confessed and the punishment decided. l told you it's over with. lt was a woman, no doubt about it. Really? But Madame, l don't want to be hauled into the police station or into court. Please be honest with me. l did it. Please forgive me. lf you're not going to be back for a while, just what are you going to be doing? l'm going to go to the house of the woman who killed Takeshi and get revenge. The woman's house? The woman who lives in the house of that big executive at Yamano Motors. lf the person who ran over Takeshi was a woman, it could only have been her. Just how are you going to get revenge? l'll get into their house. And then l'll kill whoever ran over Takeshi with my own hands. The police and the courts won't do anything. There's no other way but for me to take matters into my own hands. MIDORI MAID SERVICE MINISTRY OF LABOUR LICENSED Hello, Midori Maid Service. Excuse me. She's just gone somewhere. Yes, she'll be back next week. You could have someone else in the meantime. You want some? ls that so? Here's the schedule for tomorrow. Nomura-san? They said they'd need two people. Does anyone else want to go with her? Maeda-san, you're next. You'll be going to Mr. Robert's in Honmoku. Morita-san, you'll be at the Kiraff's in Bashamichi. Two more people... Kusunoki-san? - Yes? Takigashi 36. The Tomodas. They want you to do the laundry, some ironing, and watch the kids. Yes. Sakamoto-san? You're to go to the Fujiyama's villa in Yamate. The usual. Takagi-san, you'll be at the Kakinumas, the Yamano Motors people. You've been there many times, so you'll know what to do. - Yes. Yokoyama-san? The Mizuno's in Takanowa. They won't be home, so call me when when you get there. This place is really good. Order anything you like. l'll pay for it. l don't want anything. l have to go. Don't worry. l changed my name to Sugiyama Kiyo. Sugiyama Kiyo? Koji, l'm going tomorrow. Where to? That house. l've been waiting for this. What are you going to do there? l have a favour to ask of you. Please help me out. Mama. Good morning. l'm from the Midori Maid Service. What happened to Takagi-san? She's taking the day off. l'll be taking her place. My name is Kiyo. - l see. Fumie makes all the decisions around here. Just ask her if you need to know anything. Yes, thank you. Just switch it with this button. This one is for the bedroom and this one is for the library. Little boy, would you move please? You have a phone call. Who is it from? The caller didn't give a name. l switched it into here. Oh. Hello. Madame, you ran over a kid. Aren't you going to turn yourself in? What's wrong? It's nothing. Please leave me alone. Tea is ready. - Thank you. ls there something wrong with the lady of the house? She's too pampered, that's all. Does she drive the other car? She used to. Do you take milk? Please. l wonder why Takagi-san tells lies like that. What does she say? - Never mind. What? lt'll just start unpleasant rumours, so l think l'll just leave it at that. Go ahead, you can tell me. She said that even if you work all day here, they wouldn't even give you a cup of tea. Did she really say that? Hey! Let's go together. Did you tell anyone back home that you were coming with me? What's wrong? What are you talking about? Your face. lt's gone so pale. l had an unpleasant phone call. Be careful. What do you mean ''an unpleasant phone call''? l think it was some sort of mistake. Where's Kenichi? He went with Kiyo on her errand. He's quite fond of her. Mama, a sweet potato. ls it OK for him to have that? lt's fine. Sweet potatoes from street vendors are kind of expensive these days. Where did you get this? That woman bought it for me. Did you say thank you? - Yeah. - You were naughty, weren't you? - No, not particularly. Let me have some. ''Every day, the mischievous duck came to the pond and teased his friends. 'What should we do?' asked the other creatures as they gathered around Turtle.'' Your husband has returned. - l see. Dear. What's wrong? l haven't slept well ever since that day. Just forget about it. There was a phone call today. Phone? From whom? l don't know. Either someone saw the accident or someone has ratted. How could that happen? Anyway, if that were true, the trial wouldn't have gone so smoothly. lt's harassment. What did they say? They told me to confess. And that's what l'm thinking of doing. How can you say such a stupid thing? What position would that put me in? Stop talking nonsense. You've never considered me, not even once. Everything revolves around you, doesn't it. You should know better at your age to be saying such stupid things. We were wrong for each other from the very start. You used my father's political connexions and he used your money. And l got caught in the middle. There's something wrong with you. Why don't you go to a hot spring or something? l'll look into the phone call. Don't worry about it. lf you go the hot spring, you can take Fumie with you. l have work to do. Please leave me alone. What if we hired another maid? lt was her after all. The person who ran over Takeshi was Mrs. Kakinuma. Just after Takeshi was run over, she got sick. That's when she stopped driving. l saw the striped scarf, too. But even l have a striped scarf. And when you called, what do you suppose she did? She dropped the receiver and turned white. l knew. When l saw her l thought: this is the person who killed Takeshi. But even so, what good does it do you? We don't have any proof. I'll kill them. Kill? Who? There's a five-year old there, just like Takeshi. l'll kill him just like she killed Takeshi. And l'll let Mrs. Kakinuma up there suffer just like l did. Sis! Auntie! You got here at just the right time. Welcome. Why don't you go and be a live-in maid at the Kakinuma's place. They say they like you. We've always had two people, but these days the younger ones just give you lip. You're someone l think l could get along with. Well, talk it over. Auntie, are you coming to our house? l like that you're fond of children. And what you do, you do right. No, no. lt's dangerous. Wait. See how dangerous it is. What would we do if you were hit by a car? l hope you'll have me. Yes, just make friends with Kenichi. He's a bit of a strange kid. He doesn't like kindergarten. Sheets, towels, soap, those kind of things you'll find in here. Please change the sheets every other day. The iron is here. And that's our bath. Every other day we empty it. The boiler is dangerous, so let me handle that. ''How cute. Lady would be a good name for you. Lady lived a happy life and was loved by everyone... '' Why don't you go to kindergarten? - There are some mean kids there. l'll give those kids a talking to. Should we go to school together? OK. Why are you staring at Kenichi like that? Sorry. He reminds me of my brother's child. Your brother's child? Yes. He likes pachinko very much. Sometimes he runs out of kindergarten and goes to play pachinko. That's funny. Here you go. lt's the stew you like. Watch out! lt's hot. Here you are. lt's good isn't it? Hello. Hello. Yes, she is. Madame, it's for you. Who is it from? - A Mr. Yasuda. Yasuda? l don't know anyone named Yasuda. Ask the caller what he wants. Excuse me, but what can l say the call is about? Yes... Madame's car? Kiyo-san, l'll take it. What are you trying to do, calling me like this? Hello, hello? Hello? lt's a strange household. The husband and wife don't seem to get along very well. The wife seems to have a boyfriend. ls that so? What about kids? They have one. He's cute. Doesn't that make it hard for you? - lt does. But l think l'm going to do it anyway. Are you? No matter what? l'm going to do it no matter what. Why don't you follow her around. l want to know what l can about her. Mama, are you going to be late? - Yes. Did you call? Where's Fumie? Fumie has a cold. She's running a fever. l might be late tonight, so please take care of Kenichi. Shall l call you a cab? No, l'll just hail one on the street. Give Kenichi a bath. Also, my husband will probably be in late, so he won't need anything. Ken-chan, do what Kiyo tells you. lf you want to split up, l'll split up with you. But l can't live without my son. What should l do? Say something please. Why aren't you saying anything? The previous poster ran into trouble with the police. Did you hear about that? Why? The slogan ''Gamble your life on the moment'' went a little too far for them. Just leave as it is. lt'll be publicity for us in the newspapers and magazines. But more importantly, what is Kinoguchi up to? Last night the division chief and the president of the Kansai division, Terayama, were at the Yamato in Bashamichi. Terayama is there? Yes and they seemed to have called Kinoguchi in on the sly. Terayama openly says he doesn't want you as the next president. He's pushing quite loudly for Kinoguchi. - When does the boss get back? The beginning of next month. He says he's going to resign as soon as he gets back from New York. They'll have to choose the next president by the end of next month. l'll need your help. l think you'll be the next president. Without a doubt. ''Whose flower is the dandelion d-d-dandelion? The dandelion...'' What a smell! Kiyo-san! Kiyo-san! Ken-chan! Ken-chan! Are you alright? Auntie, it's kind of stinky. There was gas leaking out! - Sorry, sorry. What do you think would have happened if l hadn't noticed it? You idiot! You idiot! You idiot! l didn't do anything! She's the one who did something wrong. He's gotten more and more attached to me, and l've become more attached to him, too. That's because the kid hasn't done anything wrong. Just consider yourself unlucky and give up on it. But what's going to become of Takeshi? What will become of dead little Takeshi? Become? He was my whole life, my reason for living. When she killed him, she killed me, too. She took two lives. l want to destroy that family. All of it! RUN OVER AND KILLED ON WAY HOME FROM KINDERGARTEN Will you have your tea here? - Yes. Where's Fumie-san? She took the day off. She went to the doctor. She hasn't been able to shake her cold, so she went to get an injection. l see. Someone from Chugen Autos was here to see your car. Did they take it? - No. Are you going to sell that car? Yes. The next time they come, tell them to take that car away with them. Don't you drive, Madame? Fumie said that you were a very good driver. l quit. Oh. Why? Because it's dangerous. Yes, it sure is. Did you see the paper this morning? They say it was a five-year old boy. What a shame. Hello. Just a moment. - Who is it from? - Someone by the name of Ogasawara. Hello. There's something l want to talk to you about. l'll be waiting for you in Mitsuzawa Park. Mitsuzawa Park? Yes. Yes. That's fine. See you later. BOY RUN OVER AND KlLLED DANGEROUS WOMAN DRlVER Ken-chan! Ken-chan! Hurry! You idiot! Watch out! What did you want to talk about? Why did you bring me to a place like this? l'm going to New York. l don't think l'll see you again after today. When? Tomorrow. You lied to me, didn't you. You said ''l've given up on going to New York. l don't need to build a career.'' l believed you. l'd decided to give up my husband and my son. ln the beginning, l was ready to fight any resistance and overcome any obstacle. But... - But what? But you should have turned yourself in then. But you didn't have the courage to do that, though. ln a moment of crisis, you ran away. lf the two of us ran into trouble, l think that you would run away again. You're wrong. l didn't make the driver confess. lt was my husband. That doesn't matter. So that's why you decided you didn't like me. l was just a plaything for you anyway. - You can believe what you want, but the one thing l want you to know is that l am ready to die for you. Do you see? Was there really a phone call like the one you described? Yes. Come here. How did you know about this? One of my friends works at that hotel. My friend told me. This might not be something a servant like myself should say to you, but l think this reflects poorly on you. - What hotel is it? Here is the phone number. Leave the room. Hello. ls that you, Kinuko? lt's me. l know who's there with you. Who was it? My husband. Did you talk to him about us? lt must have been Fumie, our maid. Did Ken-chan go to sleep already? - Yes. Take this to the master. lt's cold. Would you like me to turn the gas on? Yes. There you are. lt's cold. Would you like me to turn the gas on? Sir... l was married once. My husband was a yakuza, a really bad guy. He used to kick me and hit me a lot. l broke up with him. l've never put up with being injured. Hello. Yes. Yes. Master, it's from the company. ls that you, boss? l'd like you to come down here right away. The President has returned unexpectedly. People are saying that the Blue Star's motor is a rip-off of the German DM motor. Yes. l told him l'd never heard anything so ridiculous. l'll be right there. Just who is spreading these ridiculous rumours? Yes. Do you think it is a plot on the part of Kinoguchi to bring me down? Yes. Yes, anyway, l'll be right there. Welcome home. Why did you do that? Don't play stupid with me! What did l do? - Stop it. Kinuko, stop! Get out! Madame, l never once said anything to your husband all this time. l don't care. Just leave. Leave now. Leave! I'll leave. Of course l'll leave. Who could live in this murderer's house, anyway. What was that? You ran over Takeshi, but you had Sugai the driver... take the blame. What are you saying? Kinu, go to your room. l'll talk to Fumie. Even if there isn't any proof, it's still a murder. l kept quiet for the Madame all this time. - l know, l know. Kiyo, you go and take care of my wife. Just who told you such a crazy story? Did Sugai tell you? - No. You've made some sort of mistake. What will you go and do now? l've heard that you don't have any relatives. lf you go into a retirement home, you'll just be poor and miserable. You can't make excuses for an argument like the one you just had with my wife. l'll give you 500,000 yen in severance pay. Come to the office tomorrow. We'll talk over your future then. Excuse me. l won't be back tonight. Someone will be here in a couple days to pick up my things. Goodbye. Just a minute. Was what you said just now true? What? About Madame running over that kid. - That was a lie! That was a lie. Yes, Madame? l want to take some medicine. Bring me some water. Yes. The Master said he wouldn't be home tonight. Did Kenichi go to sleep? - Yes. Wake him up. l want to sleep with him here tonight. To Susumu Mama. Ken-chan, were you sleeping? Sorry to wake you up. lt was bad of me. Where's Papa? He's working tonight. You can sleep with mama here. Oh, this thing is heavy, isn't it. What's wrong, mama? Mama gets tears in her eyes when she's happy. That's strange isn't it? - Funny eyes, aren't they. l've brought your water. - Please leave it over there. Kiyo-san, please turn on the heater. l'm cold. Yes. Hey! Stop that! Putting your hands in there. You want to nurse, do you? Well l'll let you. But l want you to be quiet and go to sleep. Will you need anything else? No, good night. Goodnight. l didn't do it! l didn't do it! Where are you taking me? l told you l didn't do it! l told you l didn't do it! lt wasn't me. You idiots! l didn't do it! You moron, what are you doing? l told you it wasn't me! ATROCITY: MOTHER POISONED, CHILD STRANGLED WORK OF A LIVE-IN MAID? ODD EVENTS COME TO LIGHT MURDERER WAS MOTHER WHO LOST CHILD You're a stubborn woman. We have all this evidence on you. But if you didn't do it, who did? lt wasn't me! lt wasn't me! You wanted revenge after your boy was run over, so you changed your name, signed up as a maid, and snuck into their household. That's true, just like you say. Takeshi was killed by Mrs. Kakinuma. You're wrong about that. The person who ran over your son was the driver. What was his name? Sugai, l think, but the trial is over. But that's not right. Well, what's wrong about it? lt wasn't me. lt wasn't me. You tried to avenge the death of your son by killing her. You were waiting for your chance. You killed her with potassium cyanide and then you strangled the child as he slept. Who would do a thing like that? Fumie the maid who you were working with says you did. She said you tried to kill the kid once before with gas. That's not true! That's not true! Well then, who do you say killed Mrs. Kakinuma? Who knows? Come on. How about this: Stop messing around. The bedroom door was locked. You snuck in through the window. But even so, l wasn't the one who killed them. Kanematsu Hisako said that you threatened to kill everyone in the family. Why do you believe everyone but me? l didn't kill her. l wanted to kill them. lt's true, l wanted to, and l did sneak into her room, but someone had already killed them by the time l got there. Alright then, if you're going to say that l killed them, fine, l did. That's fine with you, isn't it? l killed them. l poisoned her and l strangled the kid. l can't keep quiet about this any longer. That woman did that because l confessed to running over her child. You're right. There's nothing to do. Sir! But what good will it do now? What's going to happen to that woman? She didn't kill Kinuko. Kinuko killed herself. Killed herself? She left a suicide note. Master, please help her. l did it. l killed her. They said it wasn't you, that it was suicide. You were unlucky. No! l killed them. l strangled that kid. Sister, this is great, isn't it? Sis, what's wrong? Come on, let's go. lt's time to stop. We need breakfast.
