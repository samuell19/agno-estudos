Mr. Rearden, on your behalf, the court has entered a plea of "no contest," and this panel has found you guilty. You are hereby sentenced to ten years in prison and a fine of $50 million. Sentencing of Kenneth Danagger will be withheld pending his appearance before this body. Now, Mr. Rearden, taking into consideration your distinguished achievements, your contributions to society and your full cooperation in this matter, your sentence is suspended. This court is now adjourned. Do you realize what you've done? Dodged a bullet. You've given the people a voice. You said what was already on everyone's mind. You won. Hank, we won. Dagny... ...you can't win a battle that never ends. Look at this world. How can such small people do so much damage? We're so close to having something they won't be able to fight. Even if your motor is everything you think it'll be, - they will try like hell to stop you. - They might. They can't stop the world. Dagny... what if you never find the man who created the motor? What if you can't make it all work? I make things work. Hank, you make things work. - Yes. - That's what people like us do. And they know that. And they hate it because it threatens them. But it won't scare them away. With all the businesses that have failed, we simply cannot continue to service the few remaining customers we have without raising rates. Jim, we from Washington and Wesley Mouch would like you to table the idea of raising rates at this time. I merely mentioned it to round out the picture. Maybe you can use your pull with Mr. Mouch to get us a concession here. I'll have a word with him. You're one of Wesley's closest friends. But he won't hesitate to sacrifice his personal interests if they conflict with the public good. Right. Of course. We're glad that you're on board. We feel the first order of business is to make the rail workers happy. The unions make a lot of noise, but I don't think we have to take them too seriously. Wesley Mouch takes them very seriously. So do I. The unions represent millions of votes, Jim. And votes that your money can't buy. Taggart Transcontinental has got to set an example by reaching out to labor. Set the precedent for other companies. You'll be helping Wesley a great deal. As Chairman of the Board, I have to point out that freezing rates and paying higher wages will only push our company deeper into the red. Bob's right. We should be looking for ways to save money, not spend it. It's simple, guys. Just trim the fat off the brisket. Shut down the routes that aren't paying. - A bold idea. - Where do you suggest we start? The John Galt Line was a dumb mistake to begin with. Now with Ellis Wyatt gone, it's nothing more than a goddamn bridge to nowhere. We could use the Rearden Metal to replace the damaged rails - along the profit-making lines. - Now you're talking. Dagny, would you like to weigh in on this? No. But you're the C.O.O. You run the railroad. Do I? You must have an opinion, Miss Taggart. What do you propose? I don't propose. You're dodging your responsibility here, Dagny. I am not going to say the words that make me the murderer. It's your policies that killed the John Galt Line. It's your interference that is killing this railroad. You're the assassins. Mr. Chairman, I propose we dismantle the John Galt Line. All in favor? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries. We built something fantastic, didn't we? Yes, we did. I thought it would stand for a thousand years. It would've. Do you need more time? No. Why drag it out? Lillian. I see you're slumming it again. Hard times, you know. Don't spend all of Henry's money on the truffle mousse pâté. I can only try. Your husband's performance in court, some very powerful people found it... disagreeable. Disagreeable? You wouldn't know the half of it. Word is spreading around. He's headed for real trouble unless he learns to not be so... ...vocally anti-social. I see. You would like me to put a muzzle on him. Well, for both of our sakes, yes. Your position, your money... it's all on the line. Try not to seem so desperate, James. It's unbecoming. - What are you afraid of losing? - Everything. They have made it my responsibility to get him to cooperate. You don't understand the power they have. You haven't mentioned what I stand to gain from this. Influence in very high circles. You'll never stand in anyone's shadow. Not even Hank Rearden's. Henry's weakness is that he thinks he's not vulnerable. We have to prove him wrong. I think we have the tools to do that. The Unification Board is authorized to enforce compliance through penalties... that include, but are not limited to: fines, seizure of assets, nationalization of property, and imprisonment, for so long as an emergency lasts. We wanted all of you, our core group, to hear it first. We need you all on board. It's obvious that drastic measures have to be taken. You can count on me, Wesley. I think everyone here agrees that capitalism doesn't work, not without government as a partner. - A caretaker, really. - Exactly. Your businesses are failing. Your unions are suffering. We need to hold the line on this erosion, freeze things in place until public confidence has been restored. Now, there will be some howling... sticklers for the Constitution, clingers to the old ways, those types. - And the loose cannons. - Like Henry Rearden. Rearden is a threat to civil order and the public good. There is no room in recovery for a free thinker like Rearden. Rearden will not be a problem. Mr. Mouch, put me on screen. If this isn't a state of emergency, I don't know what is. The immense greed of a few has pushed us to the precipice. I recommend that we implement Directive 10-289 immediately. For the public good. In the name of the general welfare, to protect the security of our fellow citizens, it is decreed for the duration of the national emergency that the statutes of Directive 10-289 shall remain in effect. One: All employees and wage earners of any kind shall henceforth be attached to their current jobs and may not be discharged or quit said employment. Two: All industrial and manufacturing entities shall henceforth remain in operation and owners of said establishments shall not quit, retire, sell, or transfer their business. Three: All copyrights and patents pertaining to any invention, formula, or process shall be transferred to the federal government by means of Gift Certificates signed by the present owners of said copyrights and patents. Four: No new devices, inventions, products or goods of any nature are to be created or manufactured and the Office of Patents & Copyrights is hereby suspended. Five: Every company or sole proprietor shall henceforth produce the same quantity of goods, or provide the same services as in the Basic Year... the year just ended. No more or no less. Six: Every citizen, regardless of income, shall henceforth spend the same amount of money as in the Basic Year. And Seven: All wages, prices, dividends and other forms of income are hereby frozen at present figures. Directive 10-289 shall be administered and enforced by the Unification Board, whose decisions will be final. It's all happening so fast. You knew about this? I have appointed current Director of Economic Development, Wesley Mouch, as Recovery Czar to help us through these desperate times. Fellow Americans, with the stroke of a pen, the home of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness has been altered forever. Dr. Ferris. Come to shut me down completely? No. Not at all. That wouldn't serve anyone. Under Directive 10-289, private intellectual assets become the property of the government. Since tonight is the deadline, at midnight, I'm here as a convenience for you. All you have to do is sign this Gift Certificate... ...entrusting your patents to the Unification Board. So, you're here to steal the process for Rearden Metal. Steal? No. It'll be made available to all manufacturers. Oh, and to make people aware that you no longer hold a monopoly, the name will be changed... to Miracle Metal. Catchy. All you have to do is sign right there at the bottom. Sir, I'm not gonna sign that paper. I'm not gonna say that it's OK for you to take my patents away from me. Well, I do have... some other documents here as well. I don't imagine you'll suffer much, since your wife already knows. Of course, I can't say the same for Miss Taggart. One of the most respected businesswomen in the nation. Spotless reputation, a source of inspiration to young girls all across the country. I can't even look at this. You might not want to see this either. In an unexpected move sure to usher in a new dawn of cooperation between industry and government, billionaire steel magnate Henry Rearden has thrown his full support behind Directive 10-289. Rearden, inventor of Rearden Metal, has signed Gift Certificates transferring his patents to the government in the interest of fairness and a rapid recovery from the worst economic recession on record. Dagny. Dagny? Dagny! What the hell you doing? What's wrong? Everything. You did this. Directive 10-289. You and your government creeps. It's what the country needs right now. I'm part of the solution. Tell me. How does it feel to be the last one standing? Better than crawling around on the ground with the rest of the snakes. I won't be a slave and I won't be a slave driver. I quit. Tell that to your cronies. Dagny, you can't quit. It's against the directive. - I'm going to my family cabin. - Hold all your calls? Hold everything, Eddie. Don't contact me about the railroad. I'm done. - Rearden. - It's me. I don't know what they did to you, Hank. I hate that they had the power to do it. We're all facing difficult choices these days. Well, maybe you can live with this directive. I can't. It burns me. Don't let it. I told you, it's not gonna stop. I want to see you. Not right now. Not for a while. I need a break from everything. OK. I can understand now what would make someone just check out. That's what I'm doing. Checking out. Eddie will know where I am. Look, I don't care what the grounds are, I don't care how many judges you've gotta buy, I want Lillian out of my life. Do you understand? Get me a divorce. I have got to be free of this... completely free. This is ridiculous! Um, Mr. Taggart, who do I consult with if there are any issues? Just deal with it. What kind of issues? Well, I have some frozen trains. I can't detour them because of the split rails and repairs... Look, I haven't found anyone to replace Dagny yet. I don't know. - How long have you been here? - Almost eight months. That's plenty of time. You're promoted. Congratulations. Chief Operating Officer... - What's your name? - Mitchum. Mitchum. Carry on. Me? And for the record, there's no pay increase due to 10-289. Anybody know why Westbound 22 is behind schedule? No. Thank you. Kip, why check your watch? I don't even need a sundial to tell you that we're as late as yesterday's apologies. Well, I can tell you this: If I'm late for my campaign stop in San Francisco, I swear, I'll make it a priority to nationalize this railroad. History shows us it's the only way to make them run on time. Good goddamn. Oh, my God. Kip, are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. OK, we've got a damaged engine outside of Congratulations. Chief Operating Officer... - What's your name? - Mitchum. Mitchum. Carry on. Me? And for the record, there's no pay increase due to 10-289. Anybody know why Westbound 22 is behind schedule? No. Thank you. Kip, why check your watch? need a sundial to tell you that we're as late as yesterday's apologies. Well, I can tell you this: If I'm late for my campaign stop in San Francisco, I swear, I'll make it a priority to nationalize this railroad. History shows us it's the only way to make them run on time. Good goddamn. Oh, my God. Kip, are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. OK, we've got a damaged engine outside of Winston. - Alert all local east-west traffic. - Got it. Taggart 22 Intermountain, this is Taggart Command. Come in, over. - What the hell happened? - The engine's got a fractured bogie. Has a what? - It's the undercarriage, sir. - How long before you fix it? Well, the engine only weighs about 560,000 pounds. If you'd like to hold up one end, I'll crawl underneath, fix it myself, we'll be off in a jiff. Little smart ass. Taggart here. Goddamn it, Jim. This is a hell of a way to run a railroad. I'm stuck out here in the middle of frosty ass nowhere. Now I've got an engagement in San Francisco and all I'm getting from your people is double-talk. And just so you know, your pay-offs are not gonna buy you out of this one. - Kip, take it easy now... - Easy? Easy for me to throw you in the grease with Mouch if I don't make my fund-raiser. Now get this: You get on the horn and you get my ass out of here, pronto. What the hell is happening, Mitchum? I never got a call in the middle of the night when Dagny was running things. The 22 has a disabled locomotive just outside the Taggart Tunnel. Yeah, I know that. What are you doing to get them moving? Well, the station chief won't answer, and nobody down the line is willing to take responsibility. And I'm certainly not, I can tell you that. Don't we have another Iocomotive that we can use? I don't have a diesel within a hundred miles. But there is an old coal-burner about four miles out. Can it pull the train? It should. They use it for rail-yard towing but... ...I mean, good luck finding a driver. Do whatever you have to do to get Kip Chalmers through that tunnel and off that mountain. Sir, they say that you can't run a smoker through an eight mile passage. I don't care how you do it. Just get something done. If you don't, tomorrow morning, I'm not gonna have a railroad. And you're not gonna have a job. I found a retired engineer that's willing to drive it. Really? Thank God somebody made a decision to do something. AII right, come on back. Keep it coming! Yep, yep... Come on now! Come on! All right, slow it down a little bit. All right, that's good! Ladies and gentlemen, it is now safe to return to your seats. Would you please re-board the train at this time. I repeat, it is now safe to return to your seats. Please re-board the train. Thank you. You see? It pays to know people. Obviously my demands have been met. We'll get through the tunnel and it'll be downhill from there. To pull. When you've got it, you've got it. Eastbound Army Freight Special, 30 miles out. The 22 should be clear by the time they reach the tunnel. Right? You know what? Hold the Army Special. You can't hold it. That's a government train. It's better hold off the 22. I can't. It's a smoker on a 15 percent grade. He'II slide all the way back to Kansas if I stop him now. Well, there's always prayer. We'II be out of this tunnel in no time, I assure you. - Ladies and gentlemen... - What's happening? - ...please remain seated. - It's all right, Laura. - Kip, I'm scared! - It's all right. Just calm down. I can't be calm, I need to know what's going on! Just calm... everybody calm down! Laura, calm down! Power will be restored shortly. There is no need for concern. It's important that you remain seated... - Laura, come here! - ...and remain calm. Laura! Laura! Laura get back here! Laura! Switch the Army Special to the roll out, now! You got it! Oh, my God. Slug! How did you know I was here? Do you remember... when we were children in these woods? When we were exploring the world and everything in it, and you were always asking "why this" and "how that" and... - And you'd say, "Let's find out." - Exactly. And now, I've found you. You never did grow up, did you? Looks Iike neither of us did. Can't tell you how pleased I am that you walked away from Taggart Transcontinental. Look at you. I haven't changed. That's where you're wrong. You've stopped playing into their hands. How? They were counting on you to keep working. Ignore it. There's no future there. There's no future for the railroad. Why are you here, Francisco? I thought you'd be off somewhere, putting the pieces of your business back together. Why would I? It was all my doing. You blew up your own mines. Don't. What? We Iost the 22 Transmountain Express and the whole Taggart Tunnel. - Casualties? - Not sure yet. At least 200 on our side. The Army Special, five troop cars, maybe another 200. What are they doing about it? Not much. Don't Iet James screw up anything else until I get there. Dagny, don't go back. Hey! I'm trying to save you... You're not trying to save a damn thing. Recapping our special news bulletin: In what could be the nation's worst ever rail disaster, a Transcontinental train and another, still unidentified, train have collided in the world famous Taggart Tunnel in southern Colorado. Though there is no official casualty count, there are no reports of survivors. Who is John Galt? - Eddie. - Dagny, thank God! I'm glad you're back from vacation. You need to take some responsibility around here. We need all of our best people on this right now. Start with Central Region. Get me Ryan on the line first. Ryan's a no-show. - Then get me Knowland. - Gone. - Andrews? - Gone. McGuire? Do we have any of our quality people left? You're looking at 'em. How long until they get that tunnel open? - I didn't... - That's all right. We need a go-around, Eddie. Get me the old rail maps. The ones we used before 1950. All right. OK, the Taggart Tunnel is closed for now. We'll open the old grade... here. Uh, we haven't run heavy trains on those tracks in years. Put high rail trucks and hand crews in front of every train. Better safe than sorry, but better moving than not. Everything with wheels rolls. I'm going to Colorado. If I have to dig open that tunnel with a soup spoon we are going to open that route. Dagny, you need to be here. You mean you need me to do your job. Well... what do we tell the press? Mr. Mouch. Just when I thought there wasn't a problem in the world I didn't have. Miss Taggart, we're all very appreciative that you cut short your temporary leave of absence. I just want you to know you'll have the government's full support. If the government had stayed out of the way to begin with, we wouldn't have hundreds of people dead. Hmm. It's lamentable. I understand that you're upset, it's upsetting to everyone. Your railroad links this nation together. The public relies on it. That's why I'm willing to grant you Special Government Exceptions to Directive 10-289 in order to bring this crisis to a speedy resolution. How about this, Mouch: I ignore you altogether, and you stay out of my way. I knew we could count on your full cooperation. Tell them to hold the Comet. Your plane's being fueled as we speak. Hold the Comet, reserve my car. I'm the face of Taggart Transcontinental. I'm taking the train. Wow. Hello? Are you ready, Mr. Daniels? - Are you the only one still working? - I don't know. Could be. - But I've got my job to do. - Any idea what the problem is? Uh... Seems Iike an E-C-U malfunction. Any idea how long it'II take to fix it? Uh, could be two hours. Could be a few days. Hey, you're Dagny Taggart. Depends. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Wow. That's a great, I'd say. Wow. Gee, you're a legend. This is an honor. Thank you for my job. I'm... I'm Jeff Allen. Trackman. Taggart Transcontinental. Where'd you get the hat, Jeff Allen? Yeah, well. Those were great days... for a while. What happened at Twentieth Century Motor Company? Who is John Galt? I wish I knew who started that expression. That, uh, that might've been me. What? Well, me, or somebody else who worked at the plant back in Starnesville, Wisconsin. He used to work there. What happened there? Well, Mr. Starnes passed and his heirs took over. They wasn't worth a lick. They had this big plan about how they were gonna run the place, and we were all gonna belong to each other, Iike a big family. And the idea was that everybody would work to best of his ability, but be paid according to his needs. That's when John Galt stood up and said he'd have no part of it. How would they know whose needs came first? Now that is the rub, isn't it? Yeah. It fell apart pretty quick. The best workers had to work harder and the needy got needier. Worker turned against worker. What happened to John Galt? You know, nobody knew too much about him, really. I just remember, when he walked out he swore that he was gonna... ...he was gonna put an end to the whole thing once and for all. He said: "I will stop the motor of the world." I mean, what kind of thing is that to say, really, but...? I'll tell you something, ever since that day, every time I saw the Iights go out and some factory close... ...I thought about that man. I thought, maybe that's him... ...doing what he said... ...stopping the motor of the world. May I please borrow your truck? What's to borrow? It's your truck. - Thanks. - Yep. - Quentin! - Taggart, hello. You asked me find the person who created the motor? - I think I have the answer. - Really? That's great. Actually, I was just about to call you. - Tell me you've made progress. - I did, I really did. That's not the... thing that... I guess that's everything. See, I can't work for you anymore. I have to resign. That's fine, Quentin. I respect that. Let's talk about this in person, face to face. Honestly, there's nothing you can say to make me change my mind. Don't move. Don't do anything. I'll be there in a few hours. You'll be too late. Excuse me... I'd Iike to rent that antique. I'm sorry, it's not for rent. Is it for sale? Everything's for sale. Eddie, I'm flying to Utah. - Utah? - Long story. I'll double back to Colorado after I've met with Quentin Daniels. Sounds good. There's a man on the ground here: Jeff Allen. Double his salary... triple it. Oh, and get him a new truck ASAP. I stole his. - I'll see you soon, Eddie. - Done. Afton tower, this is Whiskey-Papa Four-Zero-Niner, requesting permission to land. Whiskey-Papa, Four-Zero-Niner, this is Afton tower, you're clear to land. Use runway 2-4 right. Departing aircraft 2-4 left. Oh, no. Come on. Pull, baby, pull. Who is John Galt? Don't move, Miss Taggart. You're hurt. You know me? Of course. For many years. Who are you? I am John Galt. English - US - PSDH
