I searched online. It turns out that the duration and color of sunrise depend on the weather and where you are on the planet. Sunrise looks different from different angles. For the sunrise in Hong Kong, from the moment the sun emerges on the horizon to the moment you see the entire sun, it lasts less than two minutes. Beautiful things are always fleeting. Angelfish. The sun is coming up, wake up. Come here, honey. Okay. Actually, I've never seen a sunrise before. I wish that I could watch my first sunrise with someone who loves me. But... I haven't met that person yet. You smell so nice. You smell terrible. I'm in a hurry. I'm meeting a client this morning. You're working on a Saturday? You should become a freelancer. You promised to watch the sunrise with me today, but you just wouldn't wake up. I'll watch it with you tomorrow, okay? Come over again tonight. I haven't been home in two nights. I have to pay my flat's management fee and feed my fish. And I have an alumni gathering tonight. The fund that I bought for you went up in value. Is it okay if I sell it? Sure, you're the pro. Have you told her yet? I'll bring over the documents later. When I go back to Vancouver, I'll talk to her. I was with my ex for over three years and we broke up via text. Sunrise and true love should exist. The question is am I that lucky to encounter them? I meet a lot of people and see a lot of account balances in my line of work. Good morning. Good morning. That's why I can tell you with absolute confidence that how much money a person has isn't necessarily proportional to that person's happiness. I've wired one million US dollars to Malaysia for you. I don't care, just tell Barrister Cheung this is super urgent. And I've prepared your 60,000 HK dollars. Here's an envelope for you. I've helped you plenty of times. Don't say no to me, okay? Here's a glass of water. Is your stomach acting up again? Anything else I can help you with? I want to withdraw money to buy a cell phone. Playing with your phone all day is bad for your peepers, do you know that? Mrs. Law, you seem more energetic these days. I made caterpillar fungus soup for you, Ms. Chan. How could I take this? It must have cost a fortune. I'll get mad if you don't drink it. Okay, let me put it here first. I'll enjoy it later. Thank you so much. See you next time. What do you think of Joyce's husband? How would I know? I really don't have time to be as nosy as you. Hey, your boyfriend hasn't dumped his girlfriend yet. You've only met Ken twice. You're cyberstalking again. I'm only stalking him because I care about you. He has been with his Vancouver girlfriend for almost a decade. Do you think he'll get rid of her that easily? What can I do then? I only found out after we started dating. That means he fooled you and you couldn't help yourself. I really feel for you. - But I'm worried that... - I got it! I know how to cut my losses. That's good. - Hello, seniors. - Welcome. - Hello. - Can I stow my luggage somewhere? I participated in planting this tree. It was the second semester of first grade. Principal Chow made me the irrigation ambassador. She said I was a patient person and that planting this tree in school would make everyone see the power of time. I see it now. The tree has grown, but I'm old. And I have more problems too. But seeing the tree seems to have brought back fond memories of being the irrigation ambassador. Mosaic? Angelfish. What are you doing, Mosaic? My goddess is back. How can I grow six inches taller in one minute? Just go and say hi. If I go to her now, wouldn't she see that I'm still this short? Napoleon and Tom Cruise are both shorter than their wives. Remember, your attitude determines how tall you stand, okay? Paul Lau? I ran into your classmate on a flight to Shanghai. He said that you're working at Goldman Sachs. Aren't you stationed in Shanghai? Angelfish. Hi. Hi. I haven't seen you since graduation. Did I interrupt your live stream? No, I'm done. You used to doodle in class all the time. Yes, and I always got punished for it. These are amazing. I can't even draw straight lines and circles properly. No, you were great at drawing rainbows. I remember you said drawing rainbows was most worth it since you could use all the colors. I'll upload the live stream to the school's website later. I suggested using it to raise money for the phoenix tree's transplant. So the tree will still be around after the reconstruction? - Yes. - That's great. We met in first grade, didn't we? It has been 22 years. Do you remember Joyce? The muse. She's pregnant. I'd better head downstairs then. You've really gotten so tall. Thank you to my fellow alumni and teachers for preparing a surprise today. Let's welcome a special guest who specially came back from the UK, our beloved former principal, Ms. Chow Nim Chi. Dear teachers and students. It takes a decade to grow a tree and a century to nurture a person. I remember planting a little sapling on the school grounds back then, hoping that everyone can witness the power of time. A trace of memory, a relationship, a longing, and love can grow stronger over time just like that little sapling. In this reunion between old friends, you may hear people telling you politely, "You've gotten prettier." or "You've gotten more handsome." But perhaps what they're really thinking is, "You've gained so much weight." or "You look so old now." In any case, I want to tell you that none of you has changed one bit. I don't care about your appearance, status, or social standing. My eyes can see through the present and travel to the past. All I care about is the beautiful memories all of you had given me. I'm grateful that you invited me and that you're all gathered here again. This is what true happiness is. Thank you. Great. I'm so happy to see you again, Principal Chow. Me too. And you haven't aged a day. What do you use for skin care, Principal Chow? I don't use anything fancy. Say, when are you due? Next month. I hear it's hard to get a maternity ward slot in Hong Kong now. That's not a problem for me. My husband has a green card anyway, so my baby will get one eventually too. - I want a photo with you, Principal Chow. - Be careful, guys. Sure thing. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Hey, don't say I didn't warn you. Pregnancy is a high-risk phase in a marriage. Men will find other women to satisfy their needs. Go on a diet right after you give birth. Don't worry. I won't let myself become an out-of-shape soccer mom. Joyce is great. Why would her husband misbehave? I'm a flight attendant. I've seen all kinds of jerks around the world. Anyway, I have a flight to catch. I'm going to say bye to Paul Lau first. Paul Lau? Isn't he married to that head girl? So? Bye! She's really something. I'm leaving, how about you? My husband is on the way. You go ahead. All right. Bye. She's leaving. What should I do? Walk over and say goodbye to her. I don't want to say goodbye to her. Then give her a ride. What if she won't let me give her a ride? There won't be another alumni gathering for three years. I have to go. - Hi. - Hi. I'll get going. - Angelfish! - Hey! - Are you leaving? - Yes. Where are you going? Do you need a ride? I'm going to my boyfriend's place. I see. I'll drive you to your boyfriend's then. It's on the way. Do you know where my boyfriend lives? Anyway, I know you have a boyfriend. It's across town. Are you sure it's on the way? Well, the world is round. Thank you for giving me chocolate eggs and lending me your pastels back then. That's nothing. It's not nothing. Ms. Cheung was such a mean teacher. If I didn't bring my pastels, I would've had to stand in the hallway as punishment. Those old spinster teachers are our childhood traumas. Your pastel box had 25 colors. You were like a millionaire among kids. I still remember that the red, green, and blue colors had three or four shades each, but I kept running out of black since there was only one. I'd ask my dad to buy a new box when I was out of the black color. Everything is outlined in black, so it runs out the fastest. And not every stationery shop carried single black pastel sticks. And you always lent me the black one. That means you really owe me a lot of favors. We can call it even if you get me a box of pastels. You said you didn't want me to get punished. Right. How could someone who liked drawing as much as you kept forgetting to bring his pastels? In first grade, just after the school year started, my dad got sick, so my mom had to take care of him. She could only juggle so much. What was he sick with? Let's talk about something else. Sorry. Pastels now come in 36 colors and 50 sticks. With two black colors. Times have really changed. Things change indeed and get torn down at will. Good thing our school is just being rebuilt. I don't get it. Old landmarks in Europe don't get demolished. They even get more valuable over time. That's true. But conservation isn't enough to convince people to keep things as they are. It takes a lot of effort by a lot of people. Who has time for nostalgia with all the novelties out there? When they demolish a building, generations of memories go with it. People can't even find the spots of old heartbreaks even if they want to. Mosaic, I'll lend you my black pastel. Thank you. But can you draw a girl instead? Sure, Angelfish. Tree will grow if you water them every day. Maybe you'll grow taller if you take more showers, Mosaic. When we get to sixth grade, boys will surely be taller than girls. The older girls say that they'll never date shorter guys. Don't worry, Angelfish, I'll surely become taller than you. Mosaic, a chocolate egg for you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Take this. Hey, did you shrink? That's why I still don't have one. What don't you have? A girlfriend. I'm not dating either. You may not have one now, but you'll have one someday. Your boyfriend is waiting. Go on. I'm fine. - Go on. - Bye. It's pouring out there. Hey, why don't you sign the form first? I might forget about it later. What's the matter? Is it something we can solve together? What should I do in order not to hurt anyone? You told her about us? That's good. She said that she couldn't live without me. What about you? After all these years, she's like family to me. Didn't you say that you didn't love her anymore? I absolutely don't love her anymore. You're the only one I love. Isn't it obvious what you should do then? But sometimes, you can't break up with family. My parents and her parents expect us to get married. I don't know how to handle so many people's expectations. She has given me ten years of her life. I can't give that back to her. You feel bad for her, but not for me? I know I'm being very selfish, but there's no other way. Sin Yu. I really love you. But I have to marry her. Do you get it? Then don't love me anymore. It turns out to be so troublesome for you. Don't act this way. I love you. Love? He and I define love so very differently. I know. How can I ever be lucky enough to be number one in someone's heart? I've waited forever for you. Unfortunately, reality is never this perfect. It's cruel. What's up with you? Sixty 50 US dollar bills. This travel insurance covers your whole family for a year with unlimited trips. Mom... What's wrong, Mom? - Don't scare me, Mom! - Mrs. Law... - Mom! - Are you okay? Mom! Call an ambulance. Mrs. Law. What should I do? Mom! Can you sit? Bye. See you next time. Bye. Can I help you, sir? Excuse me, I'm looking for Chan Sin Yu. She's with a client. Do you have an appointment? It's okay, I'll wait for her. Sure. For half a year or so, it must be hard caring for your mom in the hospital daily. By the way, how is Mrs. Law? I've been worried sick about her. You know how strokes are. Sorry. You don't have to be. It actually means I'll be free soon. No one will nag me again. All right, you don't have to see me off. You can get back to work. See you next time. Bye. A Mr. Ma dropped this off for you. Thank you. Angelfish Thank you so much. Son, I really like watching you draw. Son, is it tough to take care of me? It's not. Your mom is exhausted today. Let's not disturb her. I got it. Hello? Hey. His name is Van Gogh. - She has wanted a cat for ages. - Take a look. Don't worry. I'm counting on you. We'll never see Dad again. We will. He'll always be in our hearts, right? I need proof of address if you want to open an account. Do you have a utility bill or a bank statement? Take a look at this. A doctor's certificate? What's ALS? Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The ice bucket challenge. I've heard of that. To put it simply, my motor nerves will lose contact with my muscles. My muscles won't be under my control and gradually shrink. At first, I'll lose coordination of my limbs. Then I'll have trouble speaking. Later on, I'll lose my ability to swallow. And finally, I won't be able to breathe. Then... will you die from it? In most cases, people live two to five years after diagnosis. Is there no cure for it? There is. In the future. You don't have to cry. Sorry. It's not your fault. What can I do for you then? I thought about it for a month. I've never met someone as young as you who needs... First, you need a capital guarantee. But it can't be a long-term deposit in case there's an emergency. What I mean is... what should I do with the time I have left? Do what makes you happy, of course. That's what I think too. Go on a trip. I'll get you travel insurance and some foreign currency. I may need a wheelchair after some time. Afterward, I can only probably stay in bed and stare at the ceiling. My brain will still be conscious though. Then... binge on TV series? Do you like that? - I can... - I want to write, direct, and star in my own series. But I'm missing one thing. What is it? You. Me? I'm using up a lifetime of courage to say this. I'll only ask you this once. Will you be my girlfriend for a day? Me? This is my greatest wish. Don't give me an answer yet. Take your time to consider it. Take my time? I thought you were running out of time. ALS patients have a very low will to live Life expectancy after onset Is less than five years 70% die within 3 years ALS Causes: Hereditary Hey. I've made a decision. Look at this rainbow rain first. One, two, three! All right! Do you guys remember how rainbows are made? It takes both rain and sunshine to make a rainbow. That's right. We're done for the day. Ms. Li will take over in the next class. Where are you going, Mr. Ma? I'm going on a long holiday. You can go. Your moms are waiting outside. Mosaic. Here's a Don't List. If you're okay with it, then I'm okay with your request. "Total confidentiality. Don't let anyone know in any way." 1. Total confidentiality "Don't post anything on social media. Don't ask questions. Don't make physical contact. Don't make me cry." I'm okay with these. You know that I don't like you that way, right? I totally get it. So what do you mean by one day? From sunrise to the next sunrise. Can I have an itinerary? Can I surprise you instead? Sure. Yes! Mosaic: Just 1 day. Saturday, 5:45 a.m. Meet me at the school gate. We'll eat breakfast and watch the sunrise! Ever since I was a kid, I would feel uneasy every once in a while. Even when I'm shopping, watching a film, or eating out with my friends, I would feel a void in my heart. I slowly came to realize that I was lacking a reason to be happy. In the past, I thought someone or something would give me happiness. It turns out that it can't give me that. The void wouldn't disappear naturally. It's only becoming like an abyss. I don't know what to do. Hello? Are you okay? If you need banking services, you can call my colleagues. I miss you so much. I don't feel well, I'm going to bed. What's wrong? I'll come over to see you. Angelfish Good morning The sun will be up soon. She won't make it. It's okay. I understand. Have you had breakfast? Not yet. I'm here! Mosaic! Sorry, I had a fever last night and I forgot to charge my phone. Do you need to go home and rest then? There's no need. My fever is gone. Do you need to see a doctor? I'm fine, really. I have a portable charger. Thank you. Too bad we missed the sunrise. Why don't we eat breakfast? The breakfast is gone. But the school isn't open yet. When a door closes, perhaps another one opens. This gate is locked too. We can climb up. Climb? I can't do that. There are other ways. I'm going to guess the code. How? Eight times seven times six times five means 1,680 combinations. I feel like today is my lucky day. - You can't be this lucky! - Right? Actually, I wanted to make a few more drawings before the school is torn down. I told the principal, so he asked the caretaker to open the gate for me. Later on, he didn't want to open the gate for me anymore, so he just gave me the code. Please. You should've said so. When I was little, I fantasized about stealing the math exam from the teacher's office when the school was empty. But you were at the top of the class in math. I was worried about not being in first place. Can I make a drawing first? Sure. Teach me how to draw. First, determine the vanishing point. What's that? It tells you where the horizon is. Anything closer to it is bigger and anything farther is smaller. It will slowly lead you as your draw. That's an important point then. Stop filming for a second. Go water the tree. Okay. Hey! There's water in this. Why do you think that is? I remember you would be here at 7:30 a.m. when you had watering duties. So before 7:30 a.m., I would sit here and watch you water the tree. I noticed you enjoy having a crush. Say, did you raise enough money for the tree transplant? I got more than enough. But how will they move this big tree? The arborist will first examine how far the roots reach. Then boards will be inserted into the soil around the tree and the entire tree will be lifted with the roots using a crane. It sounds like they can't afford a single mistake. Yes. If they make a mistake, they can kill the tree. Are you done drawing yet? I'm feeling a bit nervous here. About what? Bird poop. I'm worried one will land on my head. I'm almost done. Come and take a look. It's beautiful. Let me take a photo first. Your Don't List said no social media post. I'm just documenting this for you. Are you still running a fever? No. Then... let's go to the time tunnel. Sure. What's up? Is your name on this wall? Of course not. - Let me get a pen. - Don't tell me you'll write our names. You're so tacky. You do tacky things when you date. - Okay. - Come on. Yes, there's no one here! This is so tacky! Angelfish, Mosaic It takes a decade to grow a tree and a century to nurture a person. I remember planting a little sapling that day on school grounds, hoping that everyone can witness the power of time. That's a spot-on impression. Imitate Ms. Cheung. Mosaic. You forgot your pastels again. Go stand in the hallway. Do you remember Ms. Cheung's nickname? I remember, White Glue Cheung. - Did you know that I came up with it? - Really? White glues are sticky, but they can't really glue things. Did you know that White Glue Cheung had a crush on Cheng Sir? Cheng Sir liked Principal Chow. Really? I just made that up. Let's have breakfast. - You're close to Cheng Sir. Is that true? - I'm hungry. Why did you buy so much bread? Cheng Sir just had surgery. He has only one good eye. No one is taking care of him. - Cheng Sir. - Good morning. - This is my friend. - Hello. - Let's go inside. - Come in. How is your eye? Doctors aren't magicians. I just had surgery yesterday. I won't recover that quickly. What's your name? Angela. I just had cataract surgery, so I'm blind in one eye. - Help yourself. - Okay. This place is getting torn down soon, so I didn't tidy it up. You have to watch your diet. I know, I got it. And take it easy on your eye. Don't make miniature models for now. But I have to. The shop I usually go to for materials went out of business. I don't have time to shop at Huaqiang North in Shenzhen. I'm helping a friend make a Queen's Road Central miniature. It's for an exhibition, there's a deadline. Give me a list, I'll buy them for you. No way, a chef should get his own ingredients. Is she your girlfriend? She's a female friend. We're going to Golden Computer Arcade later for computer repair. I don't believe you. Too bad you didn't come to the school's fundraising party. Principal Chow came back. Really? Yes. She's my eternal goddess. She's still single. Really? That's none of my business. You've had a crush on her for over 20 years. You've had a crush on Angelfish for 20 years too. Did she attend that night? Forget about that, Cheng Sir. Have some more bread. Hey, how do you know Principal Chow? I... No. I meant that you're still single. This hobby of yours takes up a lot of time. Hey, your bread smells delightful. I made it with wheat clay, of course it smells nice. Really? Can you teach me? No problem. Come with me. It looks like the real thing. Here. - That's right. Slowly. - Like this? Then... - Gosh. - It looks like the real deal. Does Cheng Sir know about your illness? I don't want him to worry. But you don't mind me worrying? I do feel bad about it, but will you really worry? Not one bit. Cheng Sir knew about my family problems, so he has been looking after me. How can a good man like that still be single and available? This is an essential part of every date. I only get to see one film with you my whole life, so I thought about it for a long time. It's a love story. Let's support Hong Kong films. Did you reserve the whole theater? That costs a fortune. What's the film? I love this movie! I wanted to watch this with you when we were kids. Where do you study? What about you? Me? I'm a senior at St. Maryknoll. You're in an elite school? And you? I'm also a senior. I see. Which school? La Salle College. Hey kid, show me your ticket. You ushered me to this seat. What are you waiting for? The happiest thing in my childhood was when my parents took me to Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park The Don't List says that I can't make you cry. Can we say that the movie made you cry? It really has nothing to do with you. It was the movie that made me cry. The ending wasn't that sad. They even saw each other again after all those years. That's true. It's not as sad as your story. Any more surprises for me? Come with me. Someone is busking. Really? Should we make a request? Don't mess around. Let's interact with her. Buskers love that. - I don't know what song I want. - I'd like to introduce a friend to you. Urban sketcher, Mosaic. He'll sing a song for Angelfish. Thank you. Just one day as a memento Private memories are classic Just one day to love you It can give me warmth for ten years If love planted a plot We'll meet again after parting If you and destiny appear again today Can I be the one to write the story? Go to Tsim Sha Tsui And ride a ferry to look back on the times that have gone by Go to Wedding Invitations Street Hoping to reconstruct my long-harbored dream The tires keeping turning Even if the world keeps changing I will fulfill my promise come rain or come shine Searching for a soundtrack From Shum Shui Po to Mongkok This meeting comes with zero condition The air may be polluted Your friendly face Remains pure Love doesn't come with the latest software Love doesn't have the most accurate plans Because plans are out of reach Just one day, even if it's too short To make long-lasting memories Just one day, my passion hasn't changed It finally happened after waiting for 20 years Life is full of plots You'll see them if you want to If you believe that wishes will come true today Let's watch our romantic masterpiece of love You made me cry. Is it good? Welcome. Sit anywhere, stand anywhere, go wherever you want. You're not feeling well. Have a glass of water first. I'll get dinner ready. Thank you. February 28th, 2019, is the last night of Kwun Tong's Yue Man Square. Kwun Tong Town Center is URA's biggest urban renewal project. I lived in Kwun Tong when I was a kid. Do you want to go see it again? What for? The old has to go to make room for the new. Dinner is almost ready. Are you okay? Thank you. We've got a really global meal tonight. There's Russian borscht, Swiss chicken wings, Singapore-style noodles, and Yangzhou-style fried rice. You post these dishes the most on Facebook. Dig in. Let's me taste them first. They look pretty decent. I won't be shy then. Your walls have so much to look at. And I can see how noble your mom was. My mom was really good to my dad. But before he died, my dad said that he didn't make my mom happy. Is that why you're too scared to find a girlfriend? Yes. Your dad didn't know a thing about women then. When a woman really loves you, she'll do anything unconditionally. My dad wanted euthanasia, but my mom wouldn't allow it. They really cared about each other. I'm sorry for making you give a day to me. It's very selfish. You're wrong. I'm very willing to give you a day. Happy birthday to you You must celebrate things when you're dating. - Let's make a wish together. - Okay. I'm done. - Happy birthday! - Thank you. Just give me a small piece. Okay. You really should publish a sketchbook. Thank you. When did you start doing urban sketches? When I was 16, the Star Ferry Pier was being torn down. My dad had passed away. My mom's depression had gotten worse. I remember watching the live broadcast with her that night. It was November 11th, 2006. The clock rang 12 times for the last time at the pier, then the lights went out. My mom completely broke down after seeing it. A year after that, Queen's Pier was being torn down too. I decided to go on a race against time with my sketch pen. I drew anything that was being torn down. Where is this? My mom taught me this. Across from the Low Block of City Hall is Queen's Pier. Diagonally across the High Block is Star Ferry Pier. So this one is... The Star Ferry Pier? On its very last night. You should've drawn me slimmer. Right, you're much prettier in person. What's next? We must get to the airport before midnight. You think I'm Cinderella? A couple should travel together. We're traveling? We only have six hours left. How is that enough time? And I didn't bring my passport. You don't need to. Will that work? We'll be there before midnight. Pretend that we just went on a trip and our luggage got lost. Hello, I got a call that my suitcase has been found. Here's my ID card. Okay, no problem. I need some verification first. What color is the suitcase? Silver. What's the size? It's 53 cm by 33 cm by 24 cm. Okay, just a moment. You're quite creative. Sir, here's your suitcase. Thank you. My name is really on it. You should work at a travel agency. If you really do travel with me, we'll go to a museum to look at my favorite paintings. Lower the seat and take a nap. I'm not going to slack off. I promised you a day. There's just one stop left. The finale. We're going to watch shooting stars. A bit cliché, isn't it? I've never seen one though. Lucky me. I think I've been here before. Aren't the stars especially bright here? It's so different without light pollution. Can we really see shooting stars tonight? You can't exactly book them in advance. There are actually shooting stars every night. The point is how many you can see. At a minimum, maybe ten an hour. I saw around 2,000 in an hour before. You saw 2,000 shooting stars in an hour? - Cheers. - Cheers. There are 7.5 billion people in the world. The possibility of us spending a day together is lower than the possibility of seeing shooting stars. - A shooting star! - Where? There's another one! - See? I told you that there are plenty. - There's another one there! Do you remember watching stars in the Space Museum dome? Yes. That was in the fourth grade. You sat in front of me. Really? There's another one! There are really so many! Angelfish. Wake up. How many shooting stars did you see? I didn't keep count. Wake up. The sun is coming up. Really? Yes. Am I really so lucky that I can see the sunrise? It turned out that my wish had come true. I watched my first sunrise with someone who loved me. But I didn't know at the time that the person I would love the most was by my side. Thank you. Don't forget your suitcase. Can I just leave it? Finish the act to the very end. I'm actually not as great as you think I am. I'm not the Angelfish that you used to know. You can't change how I see you. Thank you. - Bye. - Hey. Why do you have this? - Be careful. - Thank you. Please be tacky for a bit. Should I draw two hearts? I wouldn't mind if you do that. - Cheng Sir. - Good morning. - This is my friend. - Hello. Let's go inside. I love this movie! My name is really on it. There's another one there! For your memory. I hope that my birthday wish will come true for you. Angelfish. Sometimes, people would do a lot of things for validation. But all the "likes" in the world still won't validate their worth in the end. Yet after that day, I knew for sure that no one in the world could compare to him. He made me feel like I was special. Mosaic After that day, Mosaic didn't contact me again. But I feel like he's by my side all the time. Tong's Cured Meat, Madam's Vegetable Stand Foshengtai Pastry Shop, Happiness Shop Foshengtai Pastry Shop, Happiness Shop Hao's Stall I'll take care of this when I go back to the bank. - Don't worry. - Thank you. Take this check too. Which account of yours should this be deposited? It's for you. I don't understand. You can cash it anytime. No one will know. Don't joke with me, Mr. Wong. Just spend one night with me. I know that it's hard for a girl to make a living on her own. And you don't make much. This money will go a long way. Think about it. I'm not going to be a homewrecker. I can see the vanishing point clearly. My name is really on it. My birthday? The code is really my birthday. It's beautiful. Let me take a photo first. Your Don't List said no social media post. I'm just documenting this for you. Mosaic, where are you? Mosaic. I'd like your advice about something. I have something to tell you too. Hello, I've got good news. We have something to say too. Let me tell you mine first. You're cutting in line in talking too? - Please. - It's fine. Let her speak first. Thank you. - I got this from Paul Lau. - You really snagged him? He says that his wife is boring. I often warned you, it's easy for women to become boring when they become wives. You really can't blame men for having girls on the side, right? It's because of shameless women like you that there are so many broken families. I'm getting a divorce and you're calling me boring? Sorry. My husband is dumping me! I've never worked a day in my life. What am I supposed to do now? So what? If that jerk won't take care of you, then I will. I, Cherry, will take care of you and your baby! It's my turn now, isn't it? I've quit my job at the bank. I want to pursue something I want to do. While you're at it, take care of these guys too. Cheng Sir, I'm... You're Angel Chan, right? I knew all along. Mosaic is in his room. He's exhausted after his checkup today. Thank you. I'll wait for him to wake up then. I'm glad you're here. He's lucky to have you around. How is he now? Cheng Sir. I told you, you don't have to come here. I can take care of myself. Cheng Sir has gone home. Where do you think you're going? I'm begging you, please go. Since I'm already here, I'm not going anywhere. I've given you a day, so you owe me at least a day too. You don't have an appetite? I don't want you to see me like this. You want euthanasia? I read your letter. I don't want euthanasia. I just want to retain some dignity. I've come with the suitcase. I don't just want a day with you. I want to be with you until the end. I'll lose my ability to walk in 30 days. - I... - In 60 days, you may not be able to eat. In 90 days, you may lose your ability to speak. In six months, you may lose your ability to breathe. I'll take care of you until your last breath then. I can't even draw anymore. I'm totally useless! You'll always be Mosaic, the kid who borrowed my pastels. Leave. - Go! - I've already thought it through. I told you I'm not going anywhere. Just go! I'm not leaving. Let me have my dignity! Why can't you believe that a miracle is possible? I don't want a miracle! I don't want you! I don't even want myself! Please don't act this way. That's enough! I'll go! I don't believe that people need to know the future because I'll do what I want to do today no matter what. That is how I can change my fate. You'll always be Mosaic, the kid who borrowed my pastels. - Where are you going? - Leave. I've already thought it through, I'm not going anywhere. Go. I told you I'm not going anywhere. Let me have my dignity! Show some self-respect too! Why can't you believe that a miracle is possible if we're together? I don't want a miracle. I don't want you. I don't even want myself! Say, did you raise enough money for the tree transplant? I got more than enough. But how will they move this big tree? The arborist will first examine how far the roots reach. Then boards will be inserted into the soil around the tree and the entire tree will be lifted with the roots using a crane. It sounds like they can't afford a single mistake. Do you know how much time we've wasted? You make me smile. Hey, I have a surprise for you. Happy second anniversary. Don't tell me you've forgotten. I'm sure you remember. Come on. Let's go and take that trip we haven't taken. Here we are at the airport, preparing to board our flight to Paris. Before you know it, we're already on the plane. We've got a long flight ahead. It's at least 11 hours long. He fell. While we're on the plane, we'll eat, watch movies, and chat. Yes. We've finally arrived. First stop, we'll look at famous paintings. They're all your favorite paintings. It's stuck. Hey. Don't fall asleep, it's not over yet. Mosaic. Mosaic, wake up. Angelfish. Wake up. The sun is coming up. For your memory. Three people in our collective memory Group exhibit by Ma Cheuk Hak, Cheng Kong Seng, Chan Sin Yu Tongma Mini Exhibit Chi's Craft Store, Happy Chicken and Duck Cheng Sir? This exhibition brings back so many memories. Principal Chow? Yes. I came straight from the airport. It has been a long time. I didn't think we would meet again at the Star Ferry Pier. This was a luxury apartment before. Let's go over there if you're done. - These were public housing, you know? - It's so pretty! Look at the buffet. There's a lot of food. What do you want to eat? - Pizza. - Pizza? This is Mosaic's sketchbook. You can have it. Thank you. Missing Ma Cheuk Hak Forever, 1990-2020 Teach me how to draw. First, determine the vanishing point. What's that? It tells you where the horizon is. Anything closer to it is bigger and anything farther is smaller. It will slowly lead you as your draw. Just one day as a memento Private memories are classic Just one day to love you It can give me warmth for ten years If love planted a plot We'll meet again after parting If you and destiny appear again today Can I be the one to write the story? The sketch book is so beautiful. I'm glad you like it. You've done so much for me. Thank you. Too bad I couldn't come through on my promise. Did you promise anything? I promised I would be taller than you. Logically, you should be in heaven now. So you're higher than me no matter what. I'll watch over you in heaven. And I'll miss you on earth. Bur you're not allowed to think of unhappy things. Do we have any unhappy things? Then I'll show up for no reason at times. It's not for no reason. If I look carefully at the details of this city, I'll see you. Give yourself a day to make memories. It's all we have in the end.
