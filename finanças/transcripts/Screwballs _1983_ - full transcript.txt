Now class, pardon moi a moment. Brent, will you take the while I'm away? - Oh class. Today, I will teach you the most advanced mouth exercise. Today, you will learn the proper way to give French head. To give Parisian head, you must use your bouche. You must use, and the most important, you must use the tongue. - The tongue? Oh Brent. Teach me again. - Oh yes, the tongue, the tongue. - Excuse me-- - Excuse me, excuse me, do you know where the? The boys' gym, do you know where the boys' gym is?

Cherry, huh? - And Melvin? I just love ya to top it off with your nuts. - Yeah, well, uh, I'll be right back. - Where you going, Jerkovski? Going to live up to your last name? We're finally leaving our own germ-free frozen food meat locker. Melvin! Jerk off, jerk off, Jerkovski! - Holy shit, it's a pussy factory. Excuse me, Purity. - Howie Bates, what are you up to now? - Oh nothing. Mirror just needs a bit of adjusting, that's all. Fuck a duck it's Roach! - Howie Bates, detention! - Holy shit, 42 years of bad luck. What are you here for? - That guy. New kid doesn't know this is my home away from home. Hey, Jerkovski! Back again, hey, where'd you beat off this time, study hall? - No meat locker. - Smart thinking, Mel. No better place to beat the beat, huh? - Sh sh sh, sh! Or I'll tell Principal Stuckoff! Stuckoff can fuck off. - You know Susie Miller wears red lacy underwears. - All the cheerleaders do, but only on Mondays. - What are they wearing Friday? - This Friday's homecoming. They probably won't wear anything. - Do you gentlemen know the meaning of the word vermin, heathens! Scum! Trash, degenerates! - I think I know what trash. - Here at Taft and Adams High School-- - Fucking A in T and A. - We have a fine reputation to uphold-- - I can give him something to hold. - A dignity to carry on. I am not about to have a few bad seeds take root, contaminating my divine garden of higher education. This afternoon on this, your regretful day of detention, I want you. I want you, my, my, my, if it isn't our homecoming queen. Oh looking quite beautiful today I might add. - What is that? - You really are new here, aren't you kid? - That's none other than Purity Busch, the last hold-out at T and A High. - She's the only girl who has it. - She's got to have the nicest tits in town. - How would you know, asshole? Nobody's ever laid eyes on them let alone hands. - Hope you've been practicing your music. - Pardon me, Principal Stuckoff, the vice principal would like to see you right away. He says it's urgent. - Business calling, my dear. I'll be back in just a moment. As for you, you swine. None of you are to leave that bench, is that understood? I'll be back in a moment, my dear. Oh. Well, aren't any of you boys going to be gentlemen? - Five days of detention. Then maybe you boys will know the meaning of the words hard labor. - Five days? - Five days. Come, my dear. - Come on, we're all in this together. - This detention is fucked. - I'll say. And you know who we've got to thank. Yeah, Miss Purity Busch. - Aren't any of you boys going to be gentlemen? - Female. - Yeah, females. Can you believe it? My first day here and I'm already in detention. - Kid, what's your name? - Tim. - Look, Tim, staying after school can be a drag, but sometimes you can luck out. You won't believe this. Two weeks ago in this lab, I got a private lesson in biology from Professor Sarah Bellum. Know what I mean, boys, a private lesson. - Cut the bullshit, Fred, no one's interested in your wet dreams. - I am. - Bullshit. You jerk off so much, if you ever did get laid, you'd probably scream out your own name. - You really got down with the bio teacher? They say she's real kinky. - I did and she is. She's so hot for me. They all are. - Purity isn't. - Yeah what's with Purity? It's like she wanted us to get in hot water. - You mean deep shit. - I almost made it with her once. Now look who's wet dreaming. - You think Purity really is a virgin? - No girl is. - My sister is. - My mother is. - Purity definitely is. There it is, gentlemen. Before homecoming let's make it a point that at least one of us will get a shot at her bod. Or at least a glimpse of her tits. Who wants to be first? - Need some wheels. I'll tell you Tim, if that seat could talk, woof, I'd sure be in a hell of a lot of trouble. Just check out this dash, there's Denise, Lynn, Kristy on New Years' Eve, and there's Kristy on New Years' morning. I felt generous. What's this, Brent? - Oh that? That's modern science. The chicks love it. - Well Brent you've got it made. - Yeah, I know. Well here we are tiger, Purity's house. You sure you're up for your big moment? - God bless Mummy, god bless Daddy, Principal Stuckoff, and of course Teddy. Please look over and protect this house, my lovely wardrobe, and naturally, my expensive and exquisite jewelry. - Just remember exactly what I said and do what I told you to do. Now Purity's bedroom is up on the second floor. - I know, I know. First window on the left. - Right, right, on the left. Now here's a couple of goodies that never fail. Old Smokey. - Old Smokey. - And a bottle of bubbly. Take 'em, compliments of the house. - Well Brent, thanks a lot. Well, wish me luck? - You don't need luck. You've got class. - And Lord, it's wonderful that you made me the smartest, prettiest, most sought after girl in the whole school. Amen. Oh, P.S., I hope you realize it's not always easy being perfect. Come on Teddy, time for beddy bye. - Here's your prune juice, Ward. - Oh nice. - Room temperature, just the way you like it. Poor baby. Let's do it tonight. - Oh shit, she's in heat again. - It's been two weeks. - Well not tonight. I've gotta conserve energy for that big bowling tournament tomorrow. - Bowling, bowling, bowling, can't you think about anything except putting your finger in that big, black ball? - Now June dear, calm down and tell me what's bothering you. - Oh Ward, I'm worried about the beaver. - Do you wanna go to dinner, Teddy? But I'm not very hungry. Okay, if you pay for it, I'll eat it. - I don't know, the guys down at the legion all are counting on me. - Ward, honey, I'll bark like a dog for you. Ruff! Ruff. Meow. - Oh all right. I guess you're worth a gutter ball or two. - Purity. Purity? - Oh no Teddy, not now. Not here in the restaurant. You should know I always have a headache. - Purity. Purity. - No, no, oh, oh. - Purity, can I come in? Oh yes, yes, yes, yes! Shoot! - What was that? - Just ignore it. I better go check outside. - Oh Ward. - Where's my musket? Maybe those Commie come to get us. - I'm not worried about them coming to get us. I'm worried about us getting to come at all. - Watch out you Russkies here I come. - Purity's bedroom's on the left. Right. No, no, the left. - Don't move. I've got a way to make my honey bun happy tonight. Meow. Meow. Where are you, you? - Vodka, I knew it. Those commies, they're here, right on my porch. Now I've got you, the only good rat is a dead rat! - He missed me by this much. Was I lucky? - So did you see her tits? - Mel, he told me he was in Mrs. Busch, not Purity. - Oh did you see her tits? - Not really. - Yeah 'cause I told him to go to the left. - Yeah and you also told me you'd be waiting outside. - Hey guys, can I get you anything more to eat? - Oh yeah but it isn't on the menu. - Oh still hungry for more, huh? Ooh, new face. Pretty good looking one at that. - Watch out, she's hot to trot! - So Tim, can I give you some more milk? - No thanks. - I'll have some more milk, Bootsie. - Sorry, just went on my break. - Hey guys, there's a great show at the drive-in tonight. The Wild Women of Wango. Anyone going? - So Tim, you up for it? - Yeah, sure. - Great, see ya at seven. - Get 'em, tiger. - Shh. No talking. I said no talking!

One two, one two, one two, one... - Testing, testing one, two, three. Purity. Purity, Purity Busch, please come to the poolside immediately to see Principal Stuckoff. - All right Purity, you're dismissed. The rest of you, once around the track and then into the pool. - Oh no, not today. - Do we have to run? It's so hard on the girls. Okay, make that two laps. - Mr. Stuckoff? Mr. Stuckoff? - Oh my God. - My fairest angel. My dream girl. Listen to the music. I'd know that nerdy voice anywhere. - Oh sure. - Ravishing and make wild, passionate love to me. We're tingling. You are ready. Now listen carefully. - I oughta wait and teach you a lesson. Follow my lead. - When you see me, you'll be wild with passion. Soon I will be with you. Do exactly what I say. Stop!

As you can see-- - It was only a joke. - Yeah like the time he dumped a barrel of frogs in the girls' bathroom. I'm gonna get you, you pervert! - Please have mercy, I'm sorry. - Sorry? You ruined my favorite pair of red panties up the flag pole. Did you say you're sorry? - What's happening here? Girls, come on. Please, no. - Somebody save me! Purity! Purity! I'm telling you guys, there were knockers everywhere. At least two of them must have been Purity's. - Yeah, Howie. - Well I just lost my glasses and couldn't see, that's all. - No way Howie, you couldn't have seen them. My sis told me Purity was in Stuckoff's office the whole last period. - Hey, that's a hot little sister you have. She's in my second period art class. I can't wait 'til we start some advanced figure drawing. - Listen, friend, watch it. Nobody messes with Trisha. - Spare me. - Sorry. - Nice shot, Jerkovski. Hey, look who's here. - Yeah, she thinks she owns that spot. She's there every day after school. Every day? - Hey guys. I think I know how to get a shot of Purity. But I'll need your help. - You've got it. Big guy. - This picture is disgusting! - Yeah, right, sex, sex, sex! Yeah. - Don't look now, but I think Paul's masturbating. - Make him stop. - I can't, he's using my hand. - Bye bye. Hang on a second. - You all right? - Mhm. - This is fun, huh? - Yeah, right. - Tim. - What? Drunken slut. You killed the master's wife. You bitch, I'll teach you! - Mom, is this movie 3D? - Yes, dear. Dirt, dirt, dirt! - What are all these? I don't know it's my father's shirt. Really I just gotta meet your father. - Like father like son. - Hey Tim. Wanna play a game? - Sure. What? - You wanna play hide the salami? - Uh, okay. - Come on, let's go in back. All right, yeah. - They make great balloons. - Let's get out of here, come on. - Did you hear that car? - I didn't hear a thing. - Real champagne? - But of course. Is there any other kind? - That's gotta be Brent. Now get out of those filthy rags. You, draw water. Which one do you want? Wonder if. - Let me just check. Oh my god, it's my sister. - Your sister? - I'll kill you! I'll kill you. You listen, do you Jerkoff? - Did somebody call me? - Hey, hey, hey. - I said nobody touches Trisha. Calm down, pal, calm down. - Calm down? Here's how I'm gonna calm down. - Hey boobs on your glass. Calm down. - That's my sister, that's my sister! I said nobody touches Trisha! Wet boobs on your glass. Let go! Here lies a very good friend. May he rest in peace. You think anyone will find him here? Don't worry, I got this whole thing planned out. Besides, on Mission Impossible. - This is the dumbest idea ever. - Hey I saw that episode. They didn't get that guy out for a month. - We'll get you out. - How is he gonna see Purity's boobs from underneath all that sand, let alone breathe? - He will. With this. I rigged it up last night after the show. I call it my super duper grooby snooper. - Principal Stuckoff's office. - Hello Miss Shivers. - Yes? - Yes this is Mrs. Garpazky. Ethel. You know Melvin's mother. Yes, yes, yes, I'm afraid my boy has come down with a terrible case of food poisoning. - Oh my. - Oh yes, still flat on his back. Yes, yes. Yes well I'm afraid he won't be able to attend classes today. No and please please tell dear Mr. Stuckoff that detention is simply out of the question. Yes, toodle-loo, bye. There, that should do it. - This calls for the Van Dusen finishing touch. Voila! - Here is a prime example of the amphibian family, the frog. Notice the skin, it's thin and moist, and attached loosely to the body only at certain points. Brent, would you care to examine these more closely? - Now, are you sure? - Class, the rest of you may go to lunch. Brent, you've been slacking off lately. I think perhaps you should stay after class. You need a little extra attention. You know, I think you've needed this kind of private lesson for a long time. Hey, this looks like a great place to play. - I want you to touch, feel, and fully experience the essence of biology. - Look, Mrs. Bellum. - Don't be so formal. Call me Sarah. - Like a dream. Now I know I'm dreaming. - Mind lighting my fire, Brent? - Your fire? - Yes, the bunsen burner. Nevermind. - Bunsen burner. - I'll take care of it. - Oh shit. Cut it out, you mangy mutt. You'll spoil everything. - Oh shit. - There now. Makes it much more romantic this way. Don't you think so? My favorite. Formaldehyde.

Who despite a recent mishap has made this event the biggest and best ever. - Bigger than you think, Stuckoff. - And now it is my pleasure to present to you this year's homecoming queen, Miss Purity Busch, who will honor us by singing our national anthem. - Thanks so much, Principal Stuckoff. And to all you students and teachers who have made my four years at Taft and Adams the best time in my life. Tonight I would like to perform for you in order to show my gratitude. - I'd like to see your gratitude. - And now will you all please rise. - God I hope Jerkovski doesn't take that the wrong way. ♪ Oh say can you see ♪ ♪ By the dawn's early light ♪ ♪ What so proudly we hailed ♪ ♪ At the twilight's last gleaming ♪ ♪ And the rocket's red glare ♪ ♪ The bombs bursting in air ♪ ♪ Gave proof through the night ♪ ♪ That our flag was still there ♪ ♪ Oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave ♪ ♪ O'er the land of the free ♪ ♪ And the home of the brave ♪
