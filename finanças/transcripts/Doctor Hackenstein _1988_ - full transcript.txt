[Music playing] [Mysterious music playing] [Thunder] My little friend, time has finally come. You must not fail me now. The very future of medical science And the life of my beloved depend upon it. [Whirring] [Zapping sound] [Music playing] [Thunder] [Squealing] [Music playing] DEAN SLESINGER: Now, Elliot, I must restate My concern over your extended leave of absence From the University. I see no reason why you cannot conduct your research In the school's facilities. If anything, the students could observe And hopefully learn something. I prefer to do my research in private. That's my point. Just how long does the great Dr. Elliot Hackenstein intend to keep his top secret research to himself? I'm your dean. And I don't even know what you're up to. Not to worry, Dean Slesinger, I never intended To keep anything from you. As a matter of fact, that's why I've Called you here this evening. DR HACKENSTEIN: Just look at her and answer no. She reads lips quite well. No. Poor thing. On the country, she's got a gift neither you nor I have. She is free from all the pains of scientific curiosity. She is not haunted by the ghosts of wonder as we are. Ghosts wonder? Yes. The phantasms of inquisitiveness. Phan... phantasms of inquisitiveness? Yes Well, which one is it? Which one is what? Which ones are we haunted by? The... the ghosts of wonder of the phantasms Of the inquisitiveness? They are one in the same. Well, what does all this have to do with your research? Everything, my dear Dean. You see, my intense curiosity has Driven me to possibly the greatest scientific discovery Of our time. Dean Slesinger, I have developed a mastery over the human body And all its parts, living and dean. Not only can I construct a single human body From the pieces of many others, but I Can bring that inanimate hodgepodge Of parts back to life. I thought we'd already resolved this issue. But it's my research. DEAN SLESINGER: I thought we had agreed three years ago that you Would put aside you ridiculous dreams And you'd devote your considerable talents To the field... to the field of medicine. No, I don't want anymore coffee. Dean Slesinger, please, come with me. I have something to show you. Oh it's... it's in the attic, is it? Now, this is what I was talking about. If... if all this were done at the school, You could have a splendid laboratory. The students could observe your work... Dean Slesinger. DEAN SLESINGER: Yes. What I am about to show you has never passed Before anyone's eyes but mine. I plan to reconstruct and bring back from the dead A human being. You're not only mad, you're a murderer. I am not a murderer. This is the head of... of my wife. What have you done to her? It is not what I have done, it is what I plan to do. I lost my beloved Sheila to the savage, razor sharp propellers Of the Lusitania on its maiden voyage. I'm about to reverse the hands of time And take hold of my own fate. I am going to bring my beloved back to life. It pains me to say this about the university's most Brilliant and promising young associate, But you, Elliot, are a charlatan. Why are you so quick to reject my work? Why are you so quick to declare yourself The savior of modern man? You've salvage a head with no eyes in it And a couple of tubes, and I'm supposed To hail you as the greatest thing since local aesthetic? I'm sorry, Elliot, but I'm afraid I Must recommend your dismissal from the university. Dean Slesinger, you must be joking. Have you no compassion? No understanding of my feeling for my poor wife? Wait a minute. I was on the maiden voyage of the Lusitania When I came here to America five years ago. I... I don't recall seeing you on board. Did I say maiden voyage? Your wife didn't fall of that ship. You killed her. That is patently untrue. You killed her in one of your ridiculous experiments. It was an accident. Things got out of hand. Dr. Hackenstein, you are a murderer. Elliot Hackenstein is no devil of destruction. He's an angel of life. But... but you can't create an inanimate creature And bring it back to life. You don't understand, Dean Slesinger. I can. I already have. [Moaning] [Heart thumping] Oh, dear God, what have I done? SHEILA (VOICEOVER): Elliot, Elliot, where am I? Oh, I've got a splitting headache. Would you get me some aspirin? Sheila? SHEILA (VOICEOVER): No wonder I have headache. All I am is a head. Elliot, I trusted you. And now I'm falling apart. Ow. My beloved, Sheila, you are disintegrating before my eyes. For your sake and mine, I must act quickly before they Try to rend you from my arms. I must find some way, somehow to rebuild you. And I must do it now. [Car backfire] Wendy, please slow down. You'll get us all killed. Shut up. Don't talk to her that way. Oh, get it caught for your poor, mistreated cousin, huh? [Horn honks] What was that? A couple of lunatics trying to get themselves killed. Well, we might as well have company when we croak. You shut up, too. We're lost. I know it. You two drank too much of that hard party. Now we're lost in the dense countryside. I should have never come along with you. Melanie dear, isn't it about time you dropped this matter? Well, how was I to know you two had no intentions whatsoever Of behaving like ladies. Imagine my amazement, Wendy, at your extent Of attempted intimate relations with strange man. Really, Melanie, you make sound like we're Still living in 1905. If only my mother and father were alive, I wouldn't have to spend all my time defending myself Too your horrible mother. Our horrible mother. Really, Melanie, how can you talk That way about your own Aunt. Well, not to worry, we'll get you home in time for just Minor scolding tonight. Look out! [Screams] [Crash] Mrs. Slesinger, Elliot Hacken... yes, fine thank you. How are you? Good, good. Mrs... Mrs. Slesinger, yes, well, you see, It appears that the Dean may not be able to make It back home tonight. Yes, well, he must have had too much brandy And I'm afraid it's gone to his head. [Moaning] You clumsy bitch. What are we going to do now? [Groaning] I think he's broken his leg. Well, it's nice to see the accident wasn't a total loss. It hurts. It hurts. And to think mother wanted you along to protect us. Why make such an issue over a stupid broken leg? The issue, dear sister, is now we have no car. And we have to carry this idiot to get fixed. Although I don't see why we don't just Leave him here to disintegrate. Seriously, Leslie, he is our brother. Family ties never stopped you from being horrid before. That's different. You're just a cousin. And not only that, you just wrecked my mother's car. [Gasps] You wouldn't dare. Oh, my, my, my, if mother were to find out. What must I do to stop you two from mistreating me so? Well, for one thing, you can keep Your mouth shut about everything that happened today. And then maybe... maybe... we won't tell her what you did. Now, listen to me, both of you. We've got to find a place to stay for the night. Get him. [Blows whistle] [Music playing] [Shrieks of pain] Sure there's nothing else around here? [Music playing] Hackenstien. Now, then, there's no sense in blurting out anything About what we've been doing. After all, we wouldn't want our dear Mother to find out that you got drunk and wrecked her, Now would we? Good evening, madam, please forgive our intrusion At this late hour, but... [Music playing] Our automobile his a terrible bump and ran off the road. And... [Music playing] Could we please impose upon you to let us inside? [Music playing] Ow. We need a doctor. I am a doctor, Miss. Dr. Hackenstien? That's Hackenstein. [Moaning] I think he's broken his leg. Help me get him to the settee. [Groaning] Ah, yes, merely a dislocated patella. It will have to be braced. But first, if you kind ladies could hold his upper body down. Very good. Now I'll just exert a bit of force to set it. [Screams] LESLIE: We noticed we had become completely lost. There we were, deep in the heart of the dense wilderness With no map and no where to turn to for help. And then the silly tire blew, sending us over the edge Of the road and into peril. And now we're afraid we'll never get into town To see our poor grandmother. Yes, well, I assure you. There's nothing to worry about. You can call her after you finish you're tea. And I'm certain she'll be delighted to come get you out Of here as soon as possible. Do you mind I smoke, Dr. Hackenstein? Allow me. Why thank you. Such attractive hands. Although I suppose one must have good hands to be a doctor. Well I'm not really a practitioner. I work primarily in research. Oh how exciting. In what specialty? Melanie, sweet, I'm sure the doctor would Prefer not to be interrogated. Oh, it's quite all right. I work in the field of obstetrics. Obstetrics? Oh, how wonderful to bring life into the world. Yes. Quite wonderful. [Knocking] Pardon me, ladies. I shan't be a moment. We're sorry to call so late in the evening... Sh, sh, sh. Come in. Come in. What's the matter? She's deaf and dumb. I've got house guests. Quick bring it up to the laboratory. [Grunting] Hurry. Yes, yes, right there. You're timing could not have been more perfect. At last I have all the elements necessary for my experiment. MR RHODES: Uh, Dr. Hackenstein, before you Open that gunny sack there's something we Figured we ought to tell you. It isn't that right, Mrs. Rhodes? Oh, yes, Mr. Rhodes. Well? You see, Doctor, our business is a very demanding one. Very demanding yes. Yes, we depend on the whims of nature. You never know who's going to pass away. Yeah, sometimes it's a... it's a young boy. Sometimes it's an old man. What did you get? Well, you see, doctor, to get a young woman's body, Well, the odds, they... They are tremendous. We don't even talk about the odds. What did you get, damn you? MR RHODES: We got a man's body. That's all there was, honest to God. But I have no use for a man. You know very well I need three young female bodies To complete my experiment. It's too late. I'm ruined. Ruined. All you two ever got me was one female, one lousy female body. Armless, legless, headless, and it's been in the ice box For months. What in god's name can a man do with something like that? We're very, very, very sorry. Aren't we, dear? Yes, Doctor, you see, one of our competitors Got the parts before we could get to the body. And we should probably mention the medical school. Oh, yeah, oh, they did. You mean to tell me, you two are incapable of tracking down A couple of arms, a simple pair of legs, and two tiny eyeballs? MRS RHODES: We can only dig up what's buried. MR RHODES: You wouldn't want us to take somebody Before the maker did, would you? SHEILA (VOICEOVER): Elliot, what are you thinking? Now, don't do anything foolish. Unless all you want is a head for a wife. Would you? SHEILA (VOICEOVER): Maybe they're right. But don't let me push you into anything. But I must. You must? Oh, no. No, no, of course not. Not at all. You could even imagine such a thing. You two can go now. Right this way. Just leave the body where it is. Here's your money and please leave quietly. Oh, thank you, Dr. Hackenstein. You know, I think all you have to do Is to shave a little of the body hair off. You won't be able to tell the difference. Isn't that right, Mrs. Rhodes. Of course. And you might try digging some of the of the dirt From under the fingernails. OK, thank you. SHEILA (VOICEOVER): Elliot, just remember, I wouldn't be like this if it weren't for you. But do what you want. After all, you're the one with the arms and legs. My dear Sheila, I now see where my destiny leads. I must complete you. And I must do it at once. Excuse me ladies, but I'm afraid I have some bad news. I just checked the telephone, and it seems the line is dead. How strange. Yes, quite strange. Maybe I can fix it. I'm afraid it's beyond repair. I'll have to fetch the telephone company in the morning. Perhaps at the same time I take you all into town. Would you do that? No trouble at all, Miss Trilling. I'll have Yolanda prepare your rooms for you. And then you'll find night clothes that Once belonged to my sister. I'm sure you'll be quite comfortable. I'm sure we will. It'll be heaven to finally get some rest. Oh, these horrible stockings. Wendy. Thank you very much for your hospitality, Dr. Hackenstein. [Mysterious music playing] Oh, Melanie. What's the point of this. I can see my sisters any time I want. Stop admiring yourself and come to bed. I can't believe you carry that thing with you wherever you go. I just always like to be prepared. That's all. Melanie, please move out from behind that thing. Please. Please. Please. Ow. [Laughter] [Music playing] [Car engine stops] Nah, not enough board. [Knocking] Just a minute. Good morning. Young man, it's the middle of the night. Huh? Yes, of course. Please, come on in. Oh, to think that my tax dollars Are sunk into this dump. Yes, well, would you like to sit down? Well, what I would like is to be elsewhere. But let's make this fast, shall we? Certainly. Now listen, deputy. My three children and my niece went out for the evening. And they should have been home hours ago. And I'd like to know what you're doing about this is. What I'm doing about this? I don't understand. The first time when I ever heard about this was just now. Just now. Young man, why should I have to inform you about something That is your job? You understand there are four missing people out there. Three young girls and a boy... very Likely at the mercy of seasoned criminals as we speak. And you sit around here waiting for me to tell You that they're in trouble? Ma'am, I'm sorry, please, just calm down. I'll get right on it. What were their names? Well, they're Trillings, of course. DETECTIVE: Of course. [Music playing] [Bubbling sound] SHEILA (VOICEOVER): Ow. DR HACKENSTEIN: Pardon me, my dear. I'm terribly sorry, Dr. Hackenstein, I thought this was the powder room. No, Miss Trilling, please, won't you stay? Why thank you. But you have to pardon my attire, Although I'm sure you regularly see patients with much less. This is true. I must say, however, that seldom are my patients as enticing As you, Miss Trilling. Dr. Hackenstein, flattery will get you everywhere. Perhaps you would like some wine to help you sleep. Dr. Hackenstein, if I wasn't convinced of your integrity, I'd suspect that you knew what wine Does to me this time of night. To science. Anything else? Would you like to see my instruments? All right. These are for abdominal operations. And these are for incising arteries. This is for surgery on the brain. What's that one used for? Amputations. Please, sit down. Allow me to refill your glass. WENDY: Just what are your intentions, Dr. Hackenstein? Only to relax you, my dear. You've done that. I feel as light as a feather. What's taking so much time, Elliot? Nothing, my dear, nothing. Oh, doctors have strong hands. I really hope that goes for the rest of your body too. Oh, Elliot, kiss it and make it all better. [Gasps] Listen, it's not what you think. I'm not trying to kill you. Really. This stuff puts you to sleep. I just need something from you. That's all. It's very important. I'll make it up to you. I swear. [Music playing] [Sawing sound] MRS TRILLING: Young man, don't mock me. DETECTIVE: Ma'am, I assure you... MRS TRILLING: Wait a minute, wait a minute, what is this? That's a holding cell, ma'am. A holding cell for what? Prisoners, ma'am. Well, where are they? Ma'am. Well, the... the prisoners, where are they? We don't have any right now. Uh, you have a prison cell and you have no prisoners? Oh, where are my tax dollars going? Uh, now, you listen, you find my children before I decide To buy out this joint and turn it Into a home for wayward girls. Raoul, start the car. Oh, by the way, if you only find my children, And you can't track down my niece, Um... don't worry about it. She'll turn up. This is good. We get to check down missing persons. We've got work. [Music playing] Wendy? Wendy? Wendy, where are you? LESLIE: Wendy? [Music playing] Wendy? Wendy? [Music playing] Oh, Doctor, I was just admiring your beautiful cigarette case. [Screams] No, not your hands. [Dramatic music playing] Please, I'm not trying to kill you. [Screams] [Screams] I found the lord and girl in the First Methodist Cemetery, Sir. So you are the legendary grave robbers, are you? Oh legendary. Well? Uh... yes, that's right, officer. I'm a detective. I don't suppose either of you two have ever Considered the irritation that one experiences when A member of the family is removed from the place where he Or she has been laid to rest? It's not a religious thing really. It has more to do with respect for the dead. What are your names? Uh... Mr. and Mrs. Xavier Thaddeus Rhodes. What's the lady's full name? Oh, oh, oh, you mean the missus? DETECTIVE: Yes. That's Ruby Horton Rhodes. Horton be my maiden name, of course. Of course. Mr. Rhodes, there's something I want to ask you. When most grave robbers practice their calling, They usually take just the valuables, You know, things like rings and necklaces. And teeth. And the key. Mm, hmm. My question is why do you two take the whole body? MRS RHODES: That's an easy one. Well, we sell them, of course... the bodies, that is. To whom? To the medical school. The medical school does not by cadavers from you two. I know, because it's a darn shame, Because we're a lot cheaper. DETECTIVE: Quiet. Now, tell me the truth. Who are your customers? Well, I'm sorry, officer... detective. We cannot divulge that seeing that's privileged information. I can beat it out of them, sir. No thank you, Robbins. That won't be necessary. Mr. And Mrs. Rhodes, I don't suppose you Were aware that four citizens of Braniff County Are missing tonight? So I have to find them. In situations like this, the first thing I do Is check out suspicious characters. I think you two are responsible. What? Us? We know nothing about those people. We don't have anything to do with those folks disappearing, I swear. We don't care about live people. We only fool around with people who are dead. [Music playing] DR HACKENSTEIN: I'm sorry, my dear, But this I had to do in preparation for the final step. So all you do is dig up dead people? That's right. And you sell them? We believe in free enterprise. To whom? To Doc... Doc? Doctor? Doctor who? Dr. Hackenstein. Now Mrs. Rhodes, look what you've gone and done. Well, he was going to find out any way. Who's Dr. Hackenstein? He lives in that big house outside of town, About 10 miles from here. Well, that was easy, wasn't it? Thank you. Robbins, keep your eyes on these two criminals. I'm going to look into this myself. Uh... please tell him we said anything. We promised we wouldn't. For you, my lips are sealed. Thank you. [Heavy breathing] [Screaming] Alex, what are you doing? I... where's Leslie. And where's Wendy? I don't know. Leslie? Wendy? Wendy? Leslie, where are you? [Shrieks] Ah. You should be more careful, son. Or that leg with never heal. Oh, my god. Don't be alarmed, Miss Victor, I was merely Cleaning up the laboratory. Care to have a look? All... all right. You work very late, Doctor. Yes, sometimes I just lost all track of the time. I can't make it. Then perhaps you better go back to back to bed. Give that leg a rest. I'll stay here. I'm sorry. We were looking for my two cousins, Dr. Hackenstein. Ah, your cousins. Yes, have you seen them? Well, as a matter of fact, I saw them earlier this evening. ALEX: I think you did something to them. Alex. I think you did something to Leslie. And Wendy too. Alex, how could you? Ha, ha, ha, not to worry. Earlier this evening, the young ladies came to me And begged me to facilitate their returning home as soon As possible, so that they might send help In the morning to rescue both yourselves And your damaged vehicle. So I lent them my car. They left with your car? Yes. Oh, Dr. Hackenstein, don't you see what has happened? They've used you. They've used you to bring further harm to me. ALEX: They did not. He's lying. Besides, they wouldn't leave me here. Oh, Alex, you fool. They couldn't care less about you. It's their terrible behavior that Got us into this awful situation in the first place. Now they mean to blame it on me. Now, I'm caught in position where I can Do nothing in my own defense. There, there, please, don't cry. Everything's going to be fine. Hey, how come I can't hear anything up there? I think we've heard just about enough from you. Get back to your room. You've done nothing but torment this poor girl. Miss Victor, please sit down. You're obviously distraught over this whole ordeal. It's been terrible. I've been a prisoner, unable to do anything But sit and watch my life disintegrate before my eyes. Your truly a godsend, Dr. Hackenstein. I must say, I feel the same way about you. [Grunts] You don't know how long I've looked for someone with eye... Ideas, your sensibility. You don't realize how immensely important it is to my work. MELANIE: I know just what you mean. I mean, a man of your aspirations and knowledge Must definitely have a woman by his side, someone To provide for him everything he needs. I couldn't have put it better myself. Up until now, I didn't feel that I Was ready to take full advantage of the... features Of a woman like you. But the time has come. In fact, it feels almost critical now. My life will not be complete until it Has the... qualities that a woman like you can provide. Elliot... Please, let me get you some more wine. SHEILA (VOICEOVER): Elliot, what's going on? I can't see you, but I hear heavy breathing. Remember, those are my eyes you're gazing into. Oh, no, my Sheila, I'm doing this for you. Pardon me. Corkscrew, Miss Victor, I can't seem to find the corkscrew, Miss Melanie Victor. [Sneezes] Here it is. [Music playing] Aren't you getting more wine? [Romantic music playing] [Door slams open] I saw what you're trying to do. I saw you touching her. Well, it's not going to do you any good. She doesn't want you. She loves me. Alex ALEX: First, you did something with Wendy and Leslie. And now you want to debauch her. Well, you might as well give it up, Because she doesn't want you. She wants me. Alex, I want you to apologize to Dr. Hackenstein right now. Apologize? For what? Don't you see what he's trying to do to you? Well, don't you? He's a man. You're a woman. Get it? I can't believe my ears. Alex, you've insulted me. And you've embarrassed our host. I shall never forgive you. [Music playing] I... I'm sorry, my dear. I've failed you. SHEILA (VOICEOVER): Yes, you have failed me. And you betrayed me with that hussy... and with me In the very next room. Now, pull yourself together. You have a job to do. Elliot, I want those eyes. [Music playing] He must have cut himself. [Music playing] [Snoring] [Music playing] Transplantation and implantation. Animation in lower life forms Reju... rejuvenation, A new goal in medicine. Dr. Elliot Hackenstein. He wrote this stuff. [Music playing] All right. Let's see what you have hidden in there. ALEX: I think that guy's dead. [Music playing] That guy's dead. [Screams] Make it stop. Hackenstein. Oh, my god. Get my bag. It's in the hall. Well, who's he? My bag, please. [Music playing] Hold him down. [Music playing] [Door creaks] [Hissing] [Door creaks] Miss Victor, I want to thank you for aiding my poor friend. But who is he? I didn't know there was anyone else here. Well, if you're impetuous cousin had... Miss Victor, I've got to retrieve a special elixir from my laboratory For the old gentleman. Please, stay with him. Certainly. DR HACKENSTEIN: Oh, you shouldn't Have done that, young man. Why did you have disturb my experiment? Why did you jeopardize my work? Ha. I've got you know. Who are you to talk big? You're a murderer. You're a murderer, Dr. Hackenstein. And when the word gets out, you're Going to be thrown away in jail for the rest Of your demented life. Better than that, you'll probably be hanged. SHEILA (VOICEOVER): Elliot. Oh, but wait, Doctor, don't think I don't have a hear. I won't turn you in. But it's going to cost you. It's going to cost you everything you've got. SHEILA (VOICEOVER): Elliot. All you had to do to is mind your own business. And you'd have gotten out of here the same way you came in. But no, you had to snoop. It's the end of the line for you, Dr. Hackenstein. I didn't want to hurt you or anything else. But what must be done must be done. SHEILA (VOICEOVER): Elliot, I'm waiting. My beloved, you will live. And you will see. [Gun locks] [Screaming] Sheila, please forgive me for ever abandoning you. I know now that I must complete my plan And infuse you with the breath of life. [Music playing] Hello. Anyway one here? [Thump] Oh, my, what has happened now? Your cousin has under gone a severe shock from witnessing The old gentleman's seizure. He will be all right. But we must put hit to bed and let him rest. MELANIE: What was he doing up in your laboratory? He drugged me. He did. I'm afraid there's not time to talk. Please get the door, Miss Victor. He did it. Quick lift. He's obviously delirious. Listen to me, in my laboratory, I Have all the chemicals necessary for the precise medication That he needs. But it will take some time to prepare it. What you must do is to stay right by his side, As well as by the side of the old gentleman So that neither of them lapses into his previous state. Miss Victor, will you be my nurse? Yes, Elliot, I will. [Mumbling] Alex, WHAT are you trying to say? He... he... he... Alex, I realize some strange things been happening here. But all I know is Dr. Hackenstein has been kind To me, unlike you two sisters. In fact, he seems like a wonderful man. [Dramatic music playing] Honestly, Alex, I can't make out A word of what you're saying. [Moaning] Ow. Alex. [Mumbling] Rejuvenation, a new goal of medicine, Dr. Elliot Hackenstein? [Music playing] Female student mutilated in laboratory accident. Medical professor Hackenstein disappears. [Music playing] [Thunder rumbling] [Owl hooting] [Snoring] [Music playing] They wouldn't leave without their clothes. [Squeaking] [Thunder rumbling] [Squeaking] No, it can't be. It's absurd. Elliot could never do such a thing. He's a giver of life. [Music playing] Dr. Hackenstein. [Screaming] [Screaming] You're right on time, Miss Victor. It's best if your organs are removed From a fully conscious body. For what I'm about to do, I'm truly sorry. But you see, it's out of my hands now. The dye's been cast. I must defer to the voice. What are you talking about? I had to use your cousins for some rudimentary members. What? You killed them? Oh, no, I would never kill them. What do you take me for? A mad man? I merely borrowed their anatomies. They're quite alive in a safe place. What do you want from me? You, my dear, are to provide perhaps The most important element. Or should I say elements? You are going to grant my Sheila the gift of sight. Oh, my god. But, Doctor, you must be joking. How could you even contemplate such a horrible thing? DETECTIVE: Detective Olin, from the sheriff's department. Pardon me, ma'am, but I was wondering, Could I speak with Dr. Hackenstein? Miss Victor, you should feel privileged. You are about to contribute to the greatest Scientific achievement in the history of mankind. That is nothing compared to the significance of bringing My wife back to life. Ah thank you. [Zapping] MELANIE: Wait, what do you think will happen to you? You're sure to get caught. No matter how great your achievement, They will throw you in jail. And then you'll never be to see her again. Save your breath, Miss Victor. You cannot sway my resolve. My Sheila will live. And I complete my creation. Yes that's it... your creation. MELANIE: Don't you see it will always be just your creation? That poor creature over there will never be a human being. It will never be your wife. No, it will be Sheila alive again. No, it will be a broken beast. Dr. Hackenstein, if you truly loved her, You would let her go. The greatest gift to her now is to let her die with dignity. [Gasping] [Dramatic music] [Gasping] Elliot, my eyes! My eyes! Give me my eyes! Don't you see? I don't want to do this. I have to. My experiment is a success. My lovely has come to life. And she must see. [Dramatic music playing] [Knocking] [Screaming] [Silent screaming] [Dramatic music playing] [Screaming upstairs] [Gun shot] My god. [Grunting] I'll be glad when this is all over. [Dramatic music playing] [Romantic music playing] I am in hell! I'm a scientist unable to complete his experiment. I am a husband unable to forget his dead wife. But most of all, I'm a hollow soul For the first time in years has started to feel love again. [Screaming] Don't. Hi, Doctor. [Gasping] SHEILA (VOICEOVER): Elliot, Elliot, where are you? What's happening? And where did you get this body? Feel this arm. SHEILA: I've ben dead for three years and all you could find Was a bloody arm like this. And these stitches... This is terrible. If you've left me with scars, you're Going to be in big trouble. Oh, my god, my eyes. I've got holes where my eyes are supposed to be. And you expect me to stay like this with my eyes sewn up. What will people think? Elliot, you've made me a monstrosity... nothing But a creature, a freak. [Screaming] [Dramatic music playing] Leslie, Leslie, wake up. Leslie. [Screaming] God, that's disgusting. [Screaming] SHEILA: Elliot, save me. The creature. Stop. Come back. Don't run away. MELANIE: She must return. Who or what was she? She was his one true love. SHEILA (VOICEOVER): Elliot, don't let me down again. Sheila. Elliot. [Screaming] Elliot. He's gone. [Music playing]
