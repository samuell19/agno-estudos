CARRIE: I was just 14 when I did the most dreadful thing you can think of. It wouldn't have happened if we hadn't been sent away. London was in the middle of the Blitz. Like thousands of other children, we were evacuated to the countryside. (HORN HONKING) We weren't told where we were going, just told to go to the station. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Bye, Mummy! (WHISTLE BLOWING) BOY: Bye, Daddy! BOY: Please come with us, Mummy! (INAUDIBLE) (WHISTLE BLOWING) Goodbye, Paddington Station! (ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Goodbye, London! Goodbye, Mum! Aren't you going to wave goodbye, Carrie? Goodbye, London! Goodbye, Mum! CARRIE: It wouldn't have happened if we hadn't been sent away. But it did happen. And it was all my fault. We were soon crossing the border into Wales, and boarding the train that would take us to our new home. Nick, come down from there! That's for later! -But I'm hungry now. -Get down now! (SIGHS) You have to keep this on! If we get bombed, they won't know who we are. (CHILDREN SINGING INDISTINCTLY) What is going on here? Carrie, explain yourself. You won't be getting anyone if you behave like this! Do you understand? -Yes, miss. -Sit down. Sit down while the train is in motion. Sit down. NICK: What does she mean? You have to be on your best behaviour. We all do. Otherwise, when we get there no one will want us. (HORN TOOTING) (SHEEP BLEATING) (CHILDREN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) What if the people we get don't like children? What if they don't give us any food? Are you going to be sick? No. Looks like you've seen a ghost. (WHISTLE BLOWING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) I saw you in the carriage. Is this it, then? Our final destination. Safe out of harm's way. I bet it doesn't have a good public library. (WHISTLE BLOWS) -"Caroline Willow." -Carrie. -"Sandwich"? -I don't like my name being abbreviated. Nor do I like being called "Jam" or "Marmalade" or even "Dripping". WOMAN: Right. Off we go. Come on, no lagging behind now. (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Come on. -Here, let me help. -No, I'll be... -It's my brother's. -No, it's not! WOMAN: Keep up at the back there. Keep up. -CARRIE: What's happening? -ALBERT: Cattle auctions. We have to sit here all day until somebody wants us. (MAN READING OFF NAMES) WOMAN: Right up to the front. Move along. Move along. MAN: Two Willows and a Sandwich. Get yourselves down over by there. And be on your best behaviour. We don't want leftovers. What if no one wants us? Well, they won't, will they? You looking like that. It's all right. I won't leave you. MAN: Now what about this pair, Meg? MEG: Oh, I think this girl will... MAN: What's your name, my lovely? My name's Lauren. Thank you very much. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) MAN: Um, I don't know. Oh! -Not very nice! -No, no good on the front. He smelt funny. -WOMAN: Hello, dear, what's your name? -Miranda. WOMAN: Oh, that's nice... Surely you can take two, Miss Evans? Um, two girls, perhaps. Not a boy and a girl. I'm afraid I've only the one room, see, and, uh, my brother's particular. Nick sleeps in my room at home. -No, I don't. -Sometimes he does because he has bad dreams. Not that he'd have them here, away from the bombing and that. I don't know what my brother will say. He's no trouble at all. There's pretty eyes you have, girl. Oh, Nick's the pretty one, really. London's far away. Did you have anything to eat on the train? Sandwiches? (CHUCKLES) Come on. Let's get you fed before Mr Evans gets home. I suggest you call me Aunty. Aunty Louisa or Aunty Lou, if that's easier. But, you know, it's best you call my brother Mr Evans. You see, he's a councillor, and a really very important man. That's our front door, but, uh, we'll go through the shop just this once, as my brother's not here. (BELLS CHIME) (DOOR CLOSES) Wow! A sheath knife! (GASPS) Come on. Mr Evans says dirt and sloppy habits are an insult to the Lord. (TURNS FAUCET OFF) So you will be good children, won't you? You look like good children. We'll try, Miss Evans. Oh! Aunty! That was lovely. Up we go, then. As long as you're careful not to tread on the drugget. My brother has very strong chapel. So you have to be especially good on Sundays. No games or books, see. Just the Bible, of course. It's new. Lovely deep pile. Mr Evans doesn't want it trodden on. But how are we to get up and down? Mr Evans says twice a day is quite enough. You see, four of us going up and down twice a day morning and evening, -that's 16 times all together and Mr Evans thinks that... -(DOOR OPENS) -He's home. Oh, dear. -(DOOR CLOSES) (WHISPERING) It's a boy and a girl. MR EVANS: I told you to fetch two girls. AUNTY LOU: The boy is just a baby. MR EVANS: No wet beds, I hope. -That I will not stand. -There's a letter. From Frederick. Huh? -He's been promoted. -Oh! My boy's been promoted. -Corporal Frederick Evans. -(CHUCKLES) -What did I say? Make a man of him. -You did, you did. We'll see how they are in the morning. One step out of line and they'll be out. You hear me? (DOOR SLAMS) NICK: I want Mum. I want Mum. I don't want to be safe in the countryside. It won't seem so bad in the morning, Nick. I promise it won't. What's that? Come on. (DOOR OPENS) Oh, you've got a few manners, I see. That's a bit of sugar on the pill. It's a wicked sin to let good food get cold. You've fallen on your feet, let me tell you. You'll get good food in this house, so no faddiness, mind. No whining around my sister's back for titbits when my back is turned. I know what boys are like. Walking stomachs. Mind your p's and q's, see, and I won't complain. Rules are made to be kept in this house. No shouting or running up stairs. And language. I'll have no foul mouths here. I don't know how you've been brought up in London, but this house is run in fear of the Lord. We don't swear. Even Dad doesn't swear. And he's in the Navy. In the Navy, is he? -What rank? -Sub-lieutenant. Oh! Is he? Well... Well! (SLURPING) (FALSE TEETH CLATTER) What's so funny, boy? (BANGS TABLE) And you will be quiet at meal times! Is that understood? (INDISTINCT TALKING) NICK: Wait for me! Wait here for me after school. (BELL RINGS) TEACHER: The bell's gone! Quickly! -Line up, line up! Quick! -Bye, Aunty Lou. AUNTY LOU: When our mam died, our dad had been dead long before. -WOMAN: Morning... -Mr Evans took me in and brought me up. His wife was still alive then, poor dear soul, and his son Frederick, just a few years younger than I am. You might say Mr Evans has been more like a father than a brother. MALE TEACHER: Now, sit down in your usual places, boys. -Reed? -Yes, sir. -Roberts? -Yes, sir. Sandwich? (CHILDREN CHUCKLE) Albert Sandwich? Simpson? CARRIE: Dear Mum and Dad, me and Nick are missing home but Aunty Lou and Mr Evans are looking after us. -School is... -Today we will begin with history. -CARRIE: School is not so bad. -Open your books. CARRIE: The best thing of all is that Mr Evans sometimes lets us help out in the shop. (BELLS CHIME) I love weighing things, and counting out the change. (CASH REGISTER DINGS) Aunty Lou is really nice, and Mr Evans can seem harsh at times, but I think he wants to be friendly. -(BELLS CHIME) -Thief! Thief! Sneaking in when I'm safely out of the way. You need a sharp lesson, my lad! NICK: Carrie! Carrie! Please, Mr Evans, he's not a thief. Just a little boy who likes biscuits! We don't get them much at home. I don't suppose he thought it was stealing. -Then he'll have to learn to think, won't he? -If you hit him, I'll... You'll do nothing but go to your room! -I'll tell my teacher! -Ha! And what will your teacher say? That it's a fine thing to do, steal from the good people who've taken you in? I'll say Nick was hungry. O Lord, look down upon this sinful child in his wickedness and lead him from his evil ways. If he is tempted again, remind him of the pains of Thy Hell, that he may quiver in his wretched flesh and repent in his immortal soul. Amen. (EXHALES) Thanks. -You're hurting me! -You're a horrible, greedy little boy who deserves more than a belting round his backside. You won't be wanting yours, then? If you do things like this again, they'll make us leave. Is that what you want? They're moving out of London. -Were they bombed? -No. Dad's ship's on convoy duty in the North Atlantic. -Where are they going? -Um... Glasgow. NICK: Glasgow? So she can see him when the ship comes into port. And she's driving ambulances in the air raids. (IMITATING PLANE FLYING) (MIMICS EXPLOSION) Oh, you've a very pretty mother. What is it, Carrie? She's not coming to see us. She promised. At Christmas. She can't get the time off. -She's not part of here. -What do you mean? She's not even part of home any more. Like a dream. Another life. -We'll have to stay now. -Hmm? There's no going home, is there? Not now. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO) Caroline. For the Christmas goose. From Dilys. My older sister. I didn't know you had an older sister. It's not been your business to know. -Where does she live? -Druid's Bottom. Druid's Bottom? Uh, don't make her go, Samuel. It's so heavy. I'll go tomorrow. She and the boy'll manage together. It's too frightening for children. I hope you've not been telling them any of your silly tales, girl. All that Old Religion stuff. No. It'll be dark soon. I'll go tomorrow, Samuel. Please. They're going now and I'll hear no more about it! We'll be fine, Aunty Lou. Really, we will. You be careful, mind, Carrie, love. You be very, very careful. Along here, I think Mr Evans said, there should be a path. This is near where the sheep were on the line. When we first came. -No, it's not. -Yes, it is, just round the corner. You looked like a ghost. -What did Aunty say, again? -Something about "old religion". What's that? Witches and ghosts? -No. Nothing. -What, then? Wolves? MAN: (MUMBLING) Hey, you. What? What? I don't know. Something. -Is it a ghost, do you think? -No. -(MAN CHUCKLING) -What, then? A wolf? -Shh... -(MAN MUMBLING) Listen. (MURMURING INDISTINCTLY) Did you hear it? (BREATHING HEAVILY) It's gone. Whatever it was has gone. (MOANING) Run! Don't look back, Nick! Whatever you do, don't look back! -(GASPS) Whoa! Carrie! -Not much further! Look! Can't! Yes, you can! NICK: Please! Help! Please help! CARRIE: Please, open the door! -(POUNDING ON DOOR) -Please! Please shut the door. We've come for Mr Evans' goose, but something was chasing us! We ran... We ran but... -Shut the door! It'll come in! -Bless you, love, its only Mr Johnny. -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -No, it's not a person! It didn't talk. It made noises! That's just Mr Johnny's way of talking. Is that what frightened you? -(JOHNNY BABBLING) -It's all right, Mr Johnny. Come and say hello. Come on. (WHISPERING) Hello, Mr Johnny. My name's Nick Willow and this is my sister, Carrie. (MUMBLING) Caroline Willow. BOTH: What are you doing here? Hepzibah chose me. -Why haven't you been at school? -I've been ill with pneumonia. Hepzibah gave me some special herbs made into medicine. The doctor was amazed. He thought I was going to be pushing up the daisies. She's a witch, you know. Not black cats and broomsticks. Just what country people call a "wise woman". -Mr Evans' sister, a witch? -(CHUCKLES) Hepzibah isn't Mr Evans' sister. Mrs Gotobed is. -Mrs Gotobed? -Has gone to bed. She's dying. She's been ill for ages. -Hepzibah looks after her. -She also looks after Mr Johnny, who's Mrs Gotobed's cousin. I read to her sometimes. You'll like her. No. I can't. We have to get back. Well, come and look at this, then. OLD WOMAN: Albert, is that you? Albert? Albert? Would you like to see the screaming skull? There's an interesting story about it. Untrue, I dare say, but interesting all the same. (CREAKS) This house is called Druid's Bottom because thousands of years ago there was a Druid settlement here. What are Druids? Priests and ministers of the ancient Celts who lived here then. What about the skull? Well, when they dug the foundations for this house, they found some bones together with a skull. They threw it aside. The next day, all the work they'd done on the foundations... Had been undone. Who by? Strange things began to happen. One of the builders had a terrible accident. Another went mad and never came back. So, the main builder went to see a local wise woman. What did the wise woman say? She told the builder to find the skull and bury it in the house. Then she wrote a curse. "Should this skull be broke or took, "these hollow eyes will on you look. "For here the skull must always lie, "Or house and soul will certain die." The builder did what she said and all was well. The house was built. But then Mr and Mrs Gotobed moved in and Mr Gotobed wanted the cellar opened out for his wine collection. They dug the skull up. That night all the wine bottles were mysteriously smashed. They quickly put the skull back in the house and it's been here ever since. So if it's moved out of the house, the curse comes true? It's just a stupid story. Who was he? She. It was a girl. She'd have been about the same age as you, Carrie. Some say she was a young priestess, who was then sacrificed for the good of the settlement. Does that mean she was killed? She was alive once, with eyes and hair. Come on. We'd better be going. (OWL HOOTING) (JOHNNY MUMBLES) -Goodbye, Mr Johnny. -Guba... Bye. NICK: He said we must come back again. You didn't understand him. He said you were cross because I sat on Hepzibah's lap. You're too old for that sort of thing. It made you look silly. It didn't feel silly. It felt nice. Did you believe Hepzibah about the skull? She doesn't seem the sort of person to make things up. MR EVANS: "And lo, "the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord "shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. "And the angel said unto them..." -(WHISPERING) When can we open our presents from Mum and Dad? -Shh! "Fear not, "for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people." (ORGAN PLAYING) * Hark the herald angels sing * Glory to the new-born king * Peace on earth and mercy mild * God and sinners reconciled * Joyful, all ye nations rise * Join the triumph of the skies * With the angelic host proclaim * Christ is born in Bethlehem * Hark! The herald angels sing * Glory to the new-born king * (CLEARS THROAT) Thank you. (MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY) (SOFTLY) He'll be better after his sleep. I thought his son was coming home. No, he's been sent to Africa or some such place. Mr Evans must miss him. Aunty Lou, they're great! The Bible's lovely, Mr Evans. Thank you. When you collected the goose, did you see my sister? No. Not really. She was upstairs in bed. -Was the house in good order? -Thank you. We had a huge tea. The best I've ever had. (SCOFFS) Better than here, I suppose. No. Not really. What are you talking about? Hepzibah's mince pies. It wasn't that good. You know what Nick's like. He'll eat anything. MR EVANS: No, it's all right when you don't have to foot the bill, isn't it? Miss Hepzibah Green is very generous, but then it doesn't come out of her pocket. She doesn't have to sweat and slave for every penny. Hepzibah's a very good housekeeper, Samuel. She's been very good to poor Dilys. And why shouldn't she be? She's on to a good thing and well she knows it. A mistress too ill to keep her eye on the books. Did you see the idiot? Mr Johnny's not an idiot! He's not! -Why are you saying all this? -I'm not! (WHISPERING) I think you're the meanest thing on this earth, Carrie Willow. Mean and ugly! Hepzibah gave us a delicious tea. -I didn't mean... -You're worse than he is! He's just nasty about everyone but you're nasty about people you like! -What am I meant to say? -You're a traitor! -No, I'm not! -Go and tell him what you really think! All right. I will! You see if I don't! Oh, that girl's got her head screwed on, all right. Miss Green didn't take her in with her soft, smarmy ways. I tell you, Lou. This could work to our benefit. The girl can be our eyes and ears. -You can't ask her to spy, Samuel. -Spy? What sort of word is that? Hepzibah has some sort of power over Dilys, our own flesh and blood, and well you know it. MR EVANS: Caroline? Where are you? What are you doing creeping around, up and down the stairs? I won't have it. I only ever walk on the paint. I wonder, perhaps you and the boy could take a tin of biscuits over to Miss Green some time? A little thank you for preparing the goose. (FALSE TEETH CLATTERING) When the Gotobeds first bought this place, it was a huge estate, stretching for miles and miles. -Why were they so rich? -They had diamond mines in Africa, and railroads in America. And did you know? Mrs Gotobed was in Russia when they had the Revolution. She escaped at night to Paris. -And then they lost it all. -How? Gambling and giving grand parties and travelling all over the world on huge ocean liners. All she's got left is a couple of fields and a few animals. They say it's a bottomless pit. (GRAMOPHONE PLAYING UPSTAIRS) Mind yourself, Carrie. I was just... We collected the eggs. Nick and Mr Johnny. Why don't you come and tell Mrs Gotobed all about it? It's all right, she won't bite. (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) Come and sit here, pretty child. On this stool. Albert says you have the most beautiful eyes. (CHUCKLES) Do you like my dress? -It's lovely. -Mmm? My husband gave it to me just after we were married. In Paris. He bought me 29 ball gowns, one for each year of our marriage. I want to wear each one of them once more before I die. Pour the tea, child. I've got a green chiffon with pearls round the neck and a blue brocade and a grey silk with pink ostrich feathers. (CHUCKLES) That was my husband's favourite, so I'll be keeping that one till last. Just a little milk in my tea, and two slices of bread, folded over. Would you like jam? Its Hepzibah's blackberry. No, child. No jam. (SIGHS) So your my brother's evacuee. (CHUCKLES) What do you think of my little brother? -Do you like him? -Well, yes. Then you're the only one who does. A cold, hard, mean man, my brother. What's he said about me? -Have you come here as his spy? -No, I have not! I think you and I, young lady, are going to get along just fine. MAN: (ON RADIO) Flynn has come along especially today to meet you. MAN: Thank you, Vernon. And hello to all you guys and gals on the all Allied fighting team. VERNON: And how do you feel about the British reaction to your American band... (CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (STATIC HUMMING) (CHEERFUL MUSIC PLAYING) * Pennsylvania 6-5000! -(CHUCKLING) -(MUSIC CONTINUES) * Pennsylvania 6-5000! (BOTH LAUGHING) * Pennsylvania 6-5000 * (LAUGHING) (CASH REGISTER DINGS) AUNTY LOU: (WHISPERING) It's from my friend. I need you to do something for me, Carrie. When I'm dead and buried, I want you to tell my brother that I hadn't forgotten him, my own flesh and blood, but that sometimes you owe more to strangers. I'm doing what I'm doing because it seems right, not because I want to spite him. You understand what I'm saying, don't you? Mmm-hmm. He'll ask you about me. -He'll want to know what I've told you. -I won't tell him. Until you're dead. (CASH REGISTER DINGS) One shilling and five pence, -and sixpence. Half a crown. -Thank you, Carrie. I'll put these things on order for you, Mrs Jenkins. Oh, it's so much easier asking you. I know if I asked Mr Evans, he'd say, "Don't you know there's a war, Mrs Jenkins?" He's at a council meeting at the moment. (WHISPERS) I rather hoped he might be. Hello. I wish your brother had your arithmetic, young lady. But he can run faster than me. The amount of trouble he gets into, he needs to. (BELLS CHIME) CARRIE: How can I help you? (IN AMERICAN ACCENT) Is Miss Louisa Evans at home, ma'am? Major Harper. Major Cass Harper. -You're American. -Is Louisa here? No. There's just me at the moment. Well, do you mind if I wait a while? Mr Evans is coming back. Uh, Miss Louisa's brother? Oh, I'd be more than glad to get acquainted with him. He hates American soldiers. Well, I'm a very respectable American soldier. Even if you did see him, Mr Evans wouldn't let you go out with her. He says dance halls are the haunts of the Devil. Well, I know for a fact Miss Louisa doesn't altogether agree with her brother on that score. -Are you from Pennsylvania? -(CHUCKLES) You can't meet her here. He won't let you. Well, would you tell her from me that I called by? And I'm sorry I missed her. (WHISTLING TUNE) Nick! Nick! There's going to be so much trouble. Hello, Carrie! Aunty Lou! Your friend... -What friend? -Major Cass Harper. The Red Lion. He wants to see you. (WHISPERING) I can't go in! Mr Evans... He won't know if you don't tell him. But there's plenty of ways this could get back to him. Oh, look at me! It doesn't matter. He seems too nice to worry about that. He is, Carrie. He's really nice. Where's your aunty? It's been a lovely autumn evening. She went for a walk up the mountain. I said I'd get the supper. (DOOR CLOSES) How's your son getting on, in Africa? He'll be home soon. Then you'll see what a fine boy he is. (YAWNS) (SIGHS) Must you work so hard? Oh! Sympathy, is it? That's something I don't often get. As I say to Frederick, the only things worth having in life are the things you've worked hard for. Was it nice up the mountain? MR EVANS: All right for some, isn't it? Messing and humbugging about all hours of the night! I'll tell you something, this girl's a far better cook than you'll ever be! (MUSIC PLAYING ON GRAMOPHONE) (MOUTHING) Thank you. (BOTH LAUGH) ALL: * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday, dear Carrie * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday, Carrie. (MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY) He says you're queen for the day. JOHNNY: (MUMBLES) Come, Nick. Come on. -NICK: Can we see the rabbits now? -(MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY) Why didn't Aunty Lou live with Mrs Gotobed? Mr Evans wouldn't allow it. The Gotobeds led a bad life, to his way of thinking. Mrs Gotobed says that Mr Evans is cold, hard and mean. He's had a hard life. Nursed his wife through a long illness... No wonder Mr Evans is... Bitter about those that've had it easy. Like Mrs Gotobed. I hope I'm never like that about Nick. They're two of a kind. Peacock proud and stubborn with it. He'll never forgive her for the life she's spent and she won't let him see what she's come to at the end of it. ALBERT: Hepzibah says the stream's got magical powers. Soak the flowers in the sacred spring and they'll last forever. CARRIE: Do you believe that? Hepzibah does. She uses this water to make her medicines. This whole place was sacred once. The grove... The mountain. I think it still is. And it always will be. Carrie... Happy birthday. Thank you. Girls don't usually say thank you when they get kissed. (WHOOPING JOYFULLY) Carrie, where are you going? Through the shop. It's my birthday. I'm queen for the day. Oh, so it's you, then. No, it's the ancient wise woman from the sacred mountain, come to tell your fortune! To your room, boy. Liberty Hall! That's what you've made of my home! Sorry. I told Aunty Lou we were going to see Hepzibah. -We're not late... -Always going to see Hepzibah! All summer long! The same story. It's only me and Nick ever go there. Have you been invited, though? My sister's house, isn't it? Suits Miss Green, all right... Out of sight, out of mind. She's not shut away. She's just ill. Oh! So you've seen her, then? Why didn't you tell me? -I didn't think. -Didn't think? Didn't think what? My own flesh and blood and I'm not interested? There wasn't anything to say. Said nothing, did she? Sat dumb? No message for me, for her brother? -(GASPS) -What did she say to you? -(GASPS) -You will tell me! Lipstick? Most women wear lipstick, Samuel. I didn't want to be any different when I go to the dance. -Dance? -At the camp. The American base, down the valley. Out! Now! Now, wash your godforsaken face, girl. Get rid of that filth! You're not my father, Samuel. MR EVANS: Don't answer me back. You have a secret, don't you, Carrie? -(DOOR OPENS) -MR EVANS: Louisa? Louisa! NICK: I know you have a secret. I can tell. And so can Evans. (GROANS) I won't tell him anything! I won't! This came. From Glasgow. It's from Mum and Dad! Wait outside. What for? Because I want you to. Carrie? Carrie? (SOFTLY) The wrong size. (WHISPERS) He's come all the way from Africa. (IMITATING PLANES FLYING) Enemy in sight, gunner? Lining them up, sir! Fire at will. (MIMICS FIRING) Good shot, Gunner Willow! -Enemy retreating! -(BOTH MIMICKING GUNFIRE) (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh, Albert! Give me that. Albert. What are you doing? Building a bonfire. Mrs Gotobed wants it done. But you can't. Fires are banned. Same old Aunty Dilys. Never one to let authority come between her and what her wants. CARRIE: This is Frederick. Mr Evans' son Frederick. (JOHNNY MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY) CARRIE: And that's Mr Johnny. He says leave it to you! FREDRICK: Oh! (LAUGHING) (JOHNNY MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY) This is the best place in the whole wide world. In the whole universe. Don't you think so, Albert? (MOCKING GIBBERISH) (LAUGHS) Stop it! (GRUNTING) -No! -No! Ah! (GROANS) ALBERT: Come on, Nick! Help me! FREDRICK: Look what that madman did to me! He ought to be locked up, a vicious loony like that. Look who's coming! Well, Frederick... Still playing the bully boy, are you? FREDRICK: It was only a bit of a joke, Aunty Dilys. I don't see anyone laughing. Enjoying your time in the Army? It's good, yeah. What will you do afterwards, when the war is over? Come back to the grocery shop? Who knows? Well... Miss Lovely Eyes... Enjoying burning all my unwanted things? I love this dress. Pale grey silk with pink ostrich feathers. Remember? -The last one before you... -Mmm-hmm. Things are seldom as bad as you think they're going to be. Not when you come to them. So it's a waste of time being afraid. You remember that. All cleared away now. Tidied up and done with. And you remember the other thing too. What to say to my brother. What do you mean, this place is too narrow? The town, the valley. Well, compared to Africa maybe, but this is your future, son. (SCOFFS) I don't know. Things have changed. I've seen how other people do things. You get what you work for, son, -you remember that. -(SIGHS) How the bloody hell do you put up with him? -Went away a boy, comes back a man. -(BELLS CHIME) What do you want? Last night... Mrs Gotobed passed away in her sleep. The shop is closed. Understood? Closed. Did she... Did it hurt her much? Dying? Hepzibah said it was just like putting a light out at the end of a day. I keep seeing the screaming skull and then Mrs Gotobed's face. What'll happen to Hepzibah? Will she have to leave Druid's Bottom? And what about Mr Johnny? Hang on, Miss Tragedy. Mrs Gotobed said she was going to make a will saying they could both stay on, without paying rent as long as they wanted to. Evans will be raving mad when he finds out. I bet he's counted on it. Her own flesh and blood. "But sometimes you owe more to strangers." That was what she told me to tell Mr Evans when she was dead. I didn't understand. I just thought she was mad. It'll make him so happy. She knew you wouldn't mind if Hepzibah and Mr Johnny stayed in the house. It's in her will that they can stay for life. Albert told me. And you didn't think to tell me this earlier? She made me promise. "You owe more to strangers". She didn't want you to think that she'd forgotten you. My own flesh and blood! (GLASS SHATTERS) Louisa! Louisa! Louisa! AUNTY LOU: What on earth has happened? That snake in the grass! That viper! That witch! I thought you'd be pleased! I will have what's mine, even if I have to go through every court in the land! We have a visitor, thanks to you. Mr Evans has given Hepzibah and Mr Johnny a month's notice. But you said they could stay here. I was wrong, it seems. -But you told me! -And you told him, didn't you? What's happened? Tell me. There's no will. Evans rang the bank and her solicitor and there's no sign of one anywhere. MR EVANS: Has anything been taken out of here? HEPZIBAH: Nothing. MR EVANS: Well, we'll see about that. 29 ball gowns? HEPZIBAH: One for each year of her marriage. MR EVANS: I will hold you personally responsible if a single one of them goes missing. One silver hairbrush... One silver hand mirror... One crystal candlestick... Did you honestly think my sister would leave you this house? Not the house. Just somewhere to live. Promises are worth nothing, Miss Green, without the proper legal papers. She told me she was going to write a will. Not that I can find. She was always full of promises, was Dilys. From now on, I want a detailed account of everything you spend. Everything you eat, every penny. Is that understood? She's not going to steal anything! What are you doing here? Who's minding the shop? Aunty Lou and Nick. I'm sorry. Here, finish this. I want an inventory of everything in this room. Miss Green, if you would follow me, please. (JOHNNY MUMBLING) I don't understand what you mean. Nick would know. Mr Evans does that. His false teeth. He's with Hepzibah. Did he take something, Mr Johnny? Out of the jewellery box? There was an envelope in there. Yes, when Mrs Gotobed was showing me her favourite pearl necklace. A brown envelope. ALBERT: Suppose Mrs Gotobed got a local solicitor to make a will for her, and then kept it in there, and Mr Evans came up... Mr Evans wouldn't take Mrs Gotobed's will. If a person dies without making a will, then everything they've got goes to the nearest relatives. The house and all the jewels and all the dresses will go to Mr Evans and Aunty Lou. Nothing to Hepzibah or Mr Johnny, not even the right to stay on here. I don't believe he'd do it. All Mr Evans had to do to get rid of her was to take the will and destroy it. Thank you, Carrie. (BELLS CHIME) So sorry to hear about your sister, Mr Evans. Yes, well, it's over now. -(DOOR OPENS) -(BELLS CHIME) Oh. What's happened? I've short-changed her. -How much? -Six pence. Well, run after her, girl. Oh, and this came for you earlier. From your mother. Quick, now. Mrs Jenkins! Thank you! (CHILDREN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (NICK SIGHS) Where will we sleep? There's an attic room. I don't want to leave. I like it here. We'll be able to see Dad when his ship comes in. How long have we got? She's meeting us at Cardiff railway station on the 21st of November. That's just a week away. ALBERT: Evans wants rid of them. He's counted every single one! Have Hepzibah and Mr Johnny found anywhere yet? There was a farm willing to take them, but the wife is worried that Mr Johnny might frighten their children. I've got to help them. There's time yet. It's from my mum. There's so much to do. I went to see Mr Rhys, the solicitor in the square. I sat there in the waiting room for about 10 minutes and then I came back out. I was scared he'd laugh at me. It wouldn't have done any good. Grown-ups only listen to grown-ups. One day, I'm going to buy Druid's Bottom and we can all live here together. CARRIE: What will happen to Hepzibah and Mr Johnny? I mean, you can't just throw them out. I've given them notice enough. And the skull... Are you going to throw that out as well? -If you do... -Is this all your Old Religion nonsense, Louisa? Come on, I've a little surprise for you both. A sheath knife! This is my very best thing ever! It's beautiful! I've so loved having you here. So much life in the house. That's the best cheese and onion pie I've ever had. (MUMBLING) I know I finished it! Could I sit with you now while you tell us a story? Which one do you want, then? You must have heard them all. The one about the wise woman and the skull. Why that one? Put that down this minute, Mr Johnny. (MUMBLING) He's been running me ragged just lately. Look what I've got. A new knife. A real hunting knife. If you give me the skull, I'll let you look at it. Mr Evans gave it to me and he gave Carrie a ring. HEPZIBAH: He gave you a ring? How lovely. ALBERT: It's her ring, isn't it? Her special garnet ring. HEPZIBAH: It belongs to Mr Evans now. He stole it. I didn't want it. He just gave it to me. And I'm glad he gave it to you, Carrie. And Mrs Gotobed would be glad too... If she knew. If he took that ring, he might have taken something else. That's enough, Albert. Carrie, my love... Do you think Mr Evans took the will? I don't know. Who's to say? Maybe there never was one. I just don't believe he could. Of course he could! How else could it have disappeared? But what will happen to you and Mr Johnny? HEPZIBAH: We'll be just fine, Carrie. But you can't leave here. You can't. It's your home. HEPZIBAH: Home is where you make it. It's not bricks and mortar. I'll take this back to the library. HEPZIBAH: "Should this skull be broke or took, "these hollow eyes will on you look. "For here the skull must always lie, "or house and soul will certain die." (SCREAMING) Let's be friends, Carrie. You write first... Care of Mr Morgan, the minister. That's where I'll be staying. I shan't write till you do. And if you don't, I'll know, won't I? Know what? (SIGHS) What a waste of electricity! Aunty Lou must have gone mad. Hmm. Good thing we got home before Mr Evans. She's gone. She's now Mrs Major Cass Harper. They got married secretly this morning and she's gone. What's Mr Evans going to say? (CLATTERING) Bit early, isn't it? Late, you mean. I was going to wake you. Train leaves at 7:00. Your mother will be waiting for you when you get to Cardiff. Soon have a cup of tea, bit of breakfast. I can do that. -Aunty Lou... -Ate a lot, your aunty did. Always at it... Munch, munch. There'll be one less mouth to feed. Like a thief in the night. Perhaps she was scared of what you might say. (SCOFFS) No, she wanted to make me look small. Just like her fine sister, Dilys. The two of them make a right pair. Sending messages, leaving notes... You look at this now. That's all I had from Dilys on her death bed... And not even sent to me either. I had to find it, going through her things, making a record, as her grand London lawyer instructed me. Is that you and Mrs Gotobed? Here's another picture I've got of her. See the ring she's got on? Same one you've got now. I bought it for her, see. With my first wages. When she gave it back, I gave it to you. When she gave it back? It was with the picture. No letter, nothing. Just my name on the envelope tucked in her jewellery box. Nothing else at all? What else would there be? What are you grinning for? I'm so glad she gave them back, the ring and the picture. It meant that she thought of you. I knew I was right. I knew you couldn't have stolen the will. There was no will. Go and wake your brother. Quick now. -MAN: Bye, Carrie. -WOMAN: Bye, Nick. Goodbye! You'll be all right now. No point in my waiting. Well, that's over with. Don't be mean. He was nice to us. (WHISTLE BLOWS) No Albert? This time of the morning? He might be waving up on the line. I would, if I were him. And if not, we can wave to the house. I shan't look. Goodbye, town! Goodbye, war memorial! Goodbye, square! Goodbye, chapel on Sundays! Goodbye, red line! Goodbye... Let me go, Carrie! Let me go! Wave to the house. (SCREAMS) Carrie? It's on fire, Nick! Druid's Bottom! It's all my fault! They'll all be dead, Nick! They're dead! (ECHOING) Dead... Dead, and it's all my fault. Dead. Dead... And it was all my fault. I was only just 14 and it was the most dreadful thing. It wouldn't have happened if we hadn't been sent away, none of it would've been... All my fault. And then what happened? We went to live in Glasgow. With Nanny and Granddad? And after the war we went and lived in London again. And you never went back? Did they really die? I wrote to Mr Evans but he never wrote back. So I assumed... I don't know. Would you ever send us away? No. I don't think so. You sent Daddy away. Isabel! That was different. Daddy wanted to go. We're not going to see him for ages. You'll see him after the holidays. He's going to drive us to France. Is he? That'll be nice. It's much better on a train. (CARRIE SOBBING) (SNIFFLES) ISABEL: Hepzibah, Mr Johnny, and Albert Sandwich. Such silly names. Ghosts and wolves... Did she really kill them by throwing a skull into the pond? That's the bit she made up. That sort of magic doesn't exist. (LAUGHS) ISABEL: Come on. I can smell bacon. Someone's there. (CLICKING TONGUE) How old was Hepzibah? Mummy didn't say. Excuse me? Are you Miss Hepzibah Green? Carrie's boy? You look just like your mother used to. Same eyes? More than that. You'll be wanting your breakfast. White ones or speckled-y ones? EDWARD: Come on, Suzy. HEPZIBAH: Look who's here, Mr Johnny. Carrie's children. (GARBLED) Hello. How are you? -He can speak. -Told you it wasn't true. Albert got me a speech therapist. HEPZIBAH: A speech therapist, all the way from London. Did your mother tell you about Albert? Sit yourself down. She thought he was dead, that's why she never wrote. And he never wrote because she promised to write first. Nothing would budge him. She thought you were all dead in the fire. She knew about the fire? She saw it on the train. She threw the skull in the pond. She started the fire. Poor little Carrie. She believed all those tales. You wouldn't, would you? The insurance people said it was Mr Johnny, playing with matches. All I know, was it was him what woke up. Saved our lives, probably. So the house burned? Badly damaged inside. We moved to the barn. Camped out to begin with. Oh... It all belonged to Mr Evans, didn't it? They never found her will. We'll never really know if there was one. So it all passed on to Mr Evans. JOHNNY: Egg cup. HEPZIBAH: He came down that day... He came down and said we could stay. Had a complete change of heart for some reason. Then he died, poor man. Heart, the doctors say. But it was more grief and loneliness. He missed his sister. Aunty Lou. Her and Major Harper moved to North Carolina after the war. Came over with her children some years ago. Aunty Lou brought me some chewing gum. Albert came to meet Lou and fixed to buy the place. "You'll be safe now," he said, when the papers were signed. He's family. HEPZIBAH: Well, we're all the family he's got. Parents are dead, he never married. Comes down to see us at least once a month. Due this morning, as it happens. Your mother still like her eggs boiled for five minutes? She won't come, Hepzibah. We walked up here yesterday, but when we got to the grove... You just go and meet her. Tell her all's well, her eggs are on the boil and Mr Johnny and Hepzibah is waiting. Go on, then. JOHNNY: Go on. Stupid. As if she knows Mum better than we do. She's no witch. Maybe she is a witch. What? -Mummy! -Mum! There you are! Come on! Come and see! (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
