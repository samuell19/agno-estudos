Hey, man! Mexico! There's a tremendous energy here and a tremendous appreciation for music and for Metallica. You come back 10 years later and are sold out in a stadium of 50 thousand plus. It doesn't happen too often. That is a testament to the longevity of the people, man, and their loyalty. And it just seems like we're getting bigger and bigger here. It's like Beatlemania. It's very special for me to play in Mexico City. It feels wonderful to be here. I came from Guadalajara. From Columbia. Metallica rules. Kicks fucking ass. From Le√≥n, Guanajuato. We came all the way from Argentina just to see them. From Victoria. From Torruco Quila. From Guadalajara. All the way from Hermosillo, Sonora. I came from Tijuana to see Metallica. From South Carolina. My name is Victor, we came from Tabasco. What is your favourite Metallica song? All of them! All of them! - "Battery". - "Fight Fire with Fire". "Master of Puppets". - "For Whom the Bell Tolls". - "Enter Sandman". - "Whiplash". - "The Day that Never Comes". - "The Unforgiven". - "Battery". - "Whiplash". - "Sanitarium". - "Fade to Black". - "Master of Puppets". - "Seek And Destroy". - "Master of Puppets". - "Battery". - "Mad for you..." "Seek and Destroy"! PRIDE, PASSION AND GLORY THREE NIGHTS IN MEXICO CITY Are you ready? OK, roll then. After ten years, Metallica return to Mexico. It is a pleasure to be here with Kirk Hammett, guitarist for Metallica. What I do know is that the chapter is not... Lars says that the chapter hasn't been written yet. Metallica returned after a ten year absence and exploded the ears of 54,000 souls. Mexico and the rest of Latin America has always been a special place for us and we're happy now to get the chance to come back. To play three nights, 50,000 people... That's an honour, that's a sign of respect from the Mexican people. You can buy the albums, you can support the band but coming to the show is what we feel, or at least, I feel, the ultimate sign. They are there giving their time and their energy. I wanna add to the last question that what makes Metallica special and motivated is that these guys are like teenagers when they put on their instruments, the drums, the guitars, once they go on they're like kids. It's like being in the garage again having fun. How does it feel to play old school stuff, almost 30 years ago, with your new stuff and make it sound good? How do you do it? We've always played our music whether it's new or old. We built set lists on what feels good and feels comfortable. We found, over the course of this tour, that the new material blends really well with the old material. What can we expect as your fans and your public to see in the things you are taping now of all your concerts, especially of your concerts here in Mexico? Every time we've been to Mexico City it's always been special. When we were here in 1993, across the street, at the indoor sports palace, those we five magical nights that ended up being part of the Live Binge And Purge package. I think that being able to play to over 150 thousand people over three nights it's gonna be very special. But one thing that Metallica has been doing in the last couple of years is playing different set lists every night, different songs every night, and if the first couple of times that we were in Mexico City is any indication then the next three nights should be very especial and that magic or that uniqueness will find its way onto what we're recording when Metallica and the audience become one. And I can't think of a better place where Metallica and the audience will become one than here in Mexico City over the next three nights. Once again, it's an honour and a privilege to be here in this country. I wrote something actually because... my Spanish is a little bad. It is a pleasure to be here with you. This is my first time in Mexico City. I am very happy to be here in the land where my mother was born. Are you ready? Are you ready? It's Metallica. Right now I am waiting for my friends. They have kept me waiting for a while and we are going to the concert and right now it is so surreal! I can't believe we are going to see Metallica! This is the first time we get to see them. Have a great time! - Here we go! - We're going! We are going to see fucking Metallica! There are three. One from Guadalajara and two from Monterey. Three friends. Well, we've arrived for the crew. We are going to go to the venue. Ten years is much too long. Especially for the Mexican people. Metallica is like our vitamins, our energy! At the beginning I couldn't understand them, but later on I really identified with them. The first time I saw them live in colour was the first time they played the five concerts. The first album I heard was Master of Puppets. I loved it from the very beginning. Then I became more interested in the band. I listened to other albums and other music. I first listened to them in the 6th grade. I have an uncle that lives in the US. When he came here for a vacation he brought me a video, and on that video was the top 10. Number I was "Enter Sandman". I was about 10 years old. Since then I've loved listening to rock and I began listening to Metallica. I would love it if they opened with "Whiplash". That would be insane! Now Metallica is part of my life. That's why I came from so far to see them. I told myself, "There is no way I can miss this concert." How long have you been waiting to see Metallica? All my fucking life! He did us the favour. He ordered the tickets, finally we were going, pure emotions to go see those fuckers! All of them. They are all the shit! I like James. I like when he laughs. I am sitting in "General A". It is all the way in the front. I am going to mosh, clear people... They are going to see the mask, they are going to think it is a luchador. It is going to be sick! Incredible! This is my third show, the last one of this tour here in Mexico and I hardly have a voice! I promised that if they play "Fade to Black" I will get a tattoo. OK. "Justice", "Sad"... The pyro has been cut and moved around. - I saw that. - The other thing we're doing is "Fuel". So maybe we should do some big ass fucking flames tonight. All right. - OK. All right. - Great, thanks. Changing the set list every night that's actually for us. I mean, we've been doing it for about six years. It's what keeps us alive. It's challenging, it's fun, it keeps in the moment all the time because we're always like, "OK, what's next?" I don't think that Metallica functions best when it's a well-oiled machine, I think Metallica functions best when the human element of Metallica is kind of accessible. - I've just put intro. - OK. I couldn't have written it better myself. Right there. Just check with me before you print it. Let me see if the boys wanna do anything different. It is approved... until they change it. The other thing you could do is you could swap "Memory" and "Nightmare" and put "Nightmare" back into its regular place. So "Memory" after "Broken, Beat & Scarred", - that might be even better. - OK. - You know what I mean? - Yeah. So you have "Memory" after "Broken, Beat & Scarred" and then have "Nightmare" in its regular spot before "Day". Let's do that. So tell her we're switching. Yes. I'll tell her. The changing of the set list every night it keeps us on our toes. - Adios. - Adios! We don't play all the songs and do all the transitions perfectly and I think it makes it more interesting because it shows us as human beings and when I think back to the '90s it was too well oiled, it was lacking some of the humanity and I really get off on that now, that it's just, unlike James, there's four guys up here playing music and it keeps it real. Welcome, Metallica! We are here to see the best band in the world. We are going to give our maximum at Sol Stadium. We are going to yell and scream. We are going to kill ourselves out there for the band that we have been waiting so long for. Mexico is the biggest party. Damn Americans, the English... They don't know how to party! We are the ones who really know how to party! The fans are just super-passionate, very fanatical. It's just truly amazing and I have to say it's been quite an experience! The people that love Metallica the most. We are the biggest and best in the world and we appreciate the best music in the world. - Thank you! - Metallica, we love you, dudes! They can wait ten years to come back, we will always be waiting with open arms, with a party waiting. Metallica will always be welcome here in Mexico. This is historical, to party, to go crazy. This is to enjoy, to die out there, to spit it out. A band with this much energy is rare here. So hit it hard! Selling out Sol Stadium, three nights, 50,000 people each night really gets your attention. We are very happy they are here. We are going to give them our energy and everything we have so that they can have a grand experience here in Mexico. It is incredible. I have never been to a show this big. I have never seen so many people. I am very happy to be here because they are my favourite band. I am waiting to see all the people that love the band enjoying it together. Any time I am upset or sad their music makes me happy. When I am happy it makes me even happier. They have made me happy my entire life. Just to be able to walk out there and see this ocean of people just swirling around and moshing to our music in such a passionate fashion, it's been amazing. Metallica, first of all is a way of life. It is the band that has demonstrated that it is important to be somebody and they could possibly be the best ever! I swear to God, at one point last night it looked like every single person, 50,000 strong, had their hands up in the air for that one part in "Sandman". It was just phenomenal. What can I say? Gracias, Metallica! Bootleg stuff? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bootleg everywhere. It's a fun place to go shopping, man. I can't believe what stuff they're making! And it is pretty cool, from glass award sculptures, 'sold out' show to embroidered shirts, Metallica masks... This one has all the dates from the tour. - Does it have Mexico? - Of course it does. You can't leave out Mexico. They know what's associated to Metallica so they do it. Which one are you going to take? Either Death Magnetic or Judas Kiss. They do it out of love, and that's it. Why are you buying it? To go to the concert. - What are you doing here? - Waiting for Metallica. The legends of metal. The greatest band in the world. This is the first edition that came out. It is from Megaforce Records. It is the first Metallica album of them all! There are not many of these in the world. This is Robert Trujillo's first CD with Metallica. I came here to wait for Metallica to see if they will sign it. How about a riff? - Who do you sound like? - Like Hammett! An autographed photo of Lars. Taken 10 years ago. He autographed it for me yesterday. Incredible people, incredible Metaleros. I guess you're still here. Do you want more? Thank you and good night! Good night! Our dreams are about to come true. We are going to meet the gods of metal, Metallica! - What's happening, man? - What's up, man? - Thank you very much! - You're welcome. You want me to punch you? Simulate, please. I studied all your lyrics. Did an analysis. Symbols and things like that. It's signed by everyone I love in the world. So if you could sign it over here... It's not yours, it's your boyfriend's. Whatever the girlfriend says! - This is for you. - Wow! That's very cool. What do you think is most scary? These guys say it's some kind of monster, but I think it's the swine-flu demon. I like the swine-flu demon. Best day of my life! This I made when I was 14. Can you believe it? - How are you doing? - Amazing! A loss of words. Why did you lie the last time? You said six years only. Why? Sometimes things are out of my control. If it was up to me I would come here every week. Are you going to the chapter party? This guys is. And he's representing me. At 9. Grand concert up there. - Nice to meet you, Mr Ulrich. - How are you doing? Back at you! How do you say "back at you"? This is one of the greatest moments of my life. I appreciate it! - Now I can die and go to heaven. - Don't die yet. - Thank you. - After the show. See you, guys! Adios! You think there's more? We'll play one more for you, all right? We'll do one more song for Mexico City. The three nights here have been beautiful. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. Metallica appreciates you, Mexico City or wherever you've come from. There's a lot of great new family members here tonight. We appreciate you from the front to the very back, to the sides... Thank you so much. Now... We'll play one more for you if you promise to give us every last drop of energy you have tonight. And you promise to sing louder than you've ever sung before. You promise to sing loud? OK. We have a promise. We're going to make history with this song. It's gonna be the loudest crowd ever. OK? And to make sure of that, can you turn on all the lights? All the lights on the crowd. Yes! Metallica Familia. Yes! OK. This one is from Kill "Em All and it requires three words for you to sing aloud: "Seek & Destroy"! That's right, Mexico! My friend Lars! Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Mexico City! Did you have fun tonight? So did we! Muchas gracias. Metallica loves you, Mexico! Thank you! Metallica loves Mexico! Thank you very very much, Mexico. Mexico rules, motherfuckers! Rockers, we've had a great time playing in Mexico! We would like to come back and play again for all of you! Come on! That's a hard act to follow down here. You know what? I just gotta say it, Three Nights in Mexico City, we're shooting a DVD. Mexico, we fucking love you! We will see you very fucking soon! Thank you! We're gonna miss this, man, I know. Just trying to suck up that moment, every last drop, man! Hands up and it's fucking love coming! Yeah! Fucking amazing! It's beyond words, beyond words. Mexico! Fucking love you! See you soon. MEXICO MATTERS AND NOTHING ELSE Thank you Metallica for making 10 years of waiting worthwhile! It was fucking amazing! It was the best! The entire trip was definitely worth making! It was totally the fucking best! This is number one! Metallica! "Nothing Else Matters" brought tears to my eyes, man. It was just... beautiful! It was just amazing. I love you! You are the masters! Masters! Masters! "Creeping Death"! Ten years have gone by! Take me! Thank you!
