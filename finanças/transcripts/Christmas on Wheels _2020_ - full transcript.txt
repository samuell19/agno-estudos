♪ Ashley: Growing up, this was our Christmas - me, my mom and her red convertible, driving through town, delivering gifts to those who needed them the most. It was our tradition. You ready, Ashley? And it made it the most special time of the year. Okay, angel bell, where are you? Item 7685. I'm so sorry. I was just looking for something. Looks to be in pretty good condition. It does. Except that I think that I maybe see a dent. A dent? Where do you see that? Well, it's hard to see, unless you're at the right angle. But, um, you know, that does depreciate the value, so... Well, it says right here in the description... "mint condition". Well, I mean, all it takes is one clumsy hand, setting it down on the table and... Right. Auctioneer: Ladies and gentlemen... please take your seats, so the bidding can commence. Good luck. Auctioneer: Do I hear $600? $600. How about $650? $650. $650 going once. $650 going twice. Sold for $650. All right, our next item up for bid is an 1875 vintage Christmas angel bell, and I'm gonna start the bidding at $100. $100. $120. $150. Auctioneer: $150. $150... $160. $200. $250. Okay, $250 going once. Going... $500. $500. Do I hear $510? $510? $510, anyone? Okay, going once, twice... [slamming] Sold for $500. [chuckling] Congratulations. Oh, thank you. I assume you're, uh-- you've got some sort of sentimental connection to the bell or... Oh, gosh no. No, no. It-- it'll double in value in a couple of years, so it was worth the price. So, you're a collector. No. Estate law. Here. You should, uh, give me a call if you ever need anything appraised. Well, anyway, I gotta run. Enjoy your day. Oh... Just about forgot. So, was that bell for you or for a client? Well, does it even matter? It's clearly gone to someone who doesn't know that there's so much more to it than just its dollar value. That bell has such a great story behind it, which I'm willing to bet he knows nothing about. Come on, Ashley. We've been working together in this industry for what? Five years? I know what a hard time you have letting go of some of the Christmas antiques you find. Well, I'm just collecting them, you know, for my shop, which may be happening soon because there's a perfect space that might be opening up for lease soon. Oh, that's great. You let me know when you're ready to make the move and I'll have my crew pack and transport all your pieces for you. Thanks so much, Gabby. Of course. ♪ [phone ringing] Hey, Charlotte. How are you? Is everything okay? Um, it is, except your uncle broke his foot. What? What happened? Oh, he tripped over a violin case. He'll be fine, but, um, I'm just so busy this time of year, I can't be home to help him out. Say no more. Tell him I'll drive out tomorrow. Actually, um... could you surprise him? Maybe just show up and say you came home for Christmas. Oh, uh, you need me to come home for all of Christmas? Oh, that would be great, Ashley. Thank you. It'll be so good to see you. And it'll be great to see you both, too. All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Great. Bye. [sighing] ♪ [knocking] Coming! Coming. Uncle Tony! Surprise! I'd say it is! Come in! Come in! [chuckling] So, what brings you back to Robinsville? Well, I figured, since I'm always away at these Christmas auctions, I thought maybe it was time. And it had nothing to do with my little accident? Oh, wow. No. I-I just noticed that. What happened? Oh, just, uh, a little music lesson mishap. Hmm. Well, then, you should probably open up my Christmas present a little early. Your presence is the greatest present I could ask for, but I do love presents. [chuckling] Now, this... is a walking stick. [both chuckling] Yeah, it was, uh-- it was used by a distinguished British general after he returned from the First World War. And clearly, now, you could probably use it to help you get around. Not that you should be getting around too much. Well, how about--[door opening] No, he should not. Aha! Uh-huh. And there she is. [chuckling] Should I be asking how Ashley might have known that I would possibly need a walking stick? Don't be so suspicious. It is so good to see you. You too. Let me just, uh, put the casserole in the oven to warm up and then you can tell us all your news. Sounds good. Mmm. [chuckling] Look at this. [chuckling] Very nice. Very nice. Yes. It's growing on me. See? I can do dancing. Okay, well, take it easy. Singing ...ke it easy. Coming around--Oh! Oh... [chuckling] I'm all right. [chuckling] I am all right. Okay, good. Mmm! Charlotte, I wish you had a shop in Seattle. Oh, I haven't expanded yet. Speaking of which, aren't you two celebrating ten years together? Yes, we are. December 23rd marks the anniversary of when we first met. So, why haven't you made it an official anniversary yet? Because it's been a perfect ten years, so why change a good thing? [knocking] Oh! No, no, no. Don't you go anywhere. That's what I'm here for. Ahh. I knew it. Hey... You? What are you doing here? Well, it's nice to see you again, too. Is that Duncan? Yes, it is! Get on in here. Hey. Duncan, this is my lovely niece Ashley. Your niece? -Mm-hmm. -Oh. Ashley, this is Duncan Morris. He is my estate lawyer. Yeah, we've met, actually. Yeah, at the-- at the-- at the, um, auction. Oh, well, actually, Duncan's here to appraise a few things. Oh. Well, then, you definitely have the right man. So, what are you here to appraise? Is it, uh, this clock, maybe? Uh... no. I-I-I don't think that's on the list. Good because it's been in our family for three generations, so you really can't put a price on it, but I'm guessing you probably could or maybe is it this piano? I mean, this thing will probably double its value in the next few years, huh? Well, not unless it hasn't been played, which I'm pretty sure it has. Or how about my mom's car? I mean, that's been driven before, obviously, but, really, it's priceless. Uh, actually... it's, uh-- the car's not here anymore. What? Why? Where is it? It was falling into neglect, sweetheart. I asked you. You told me to do whatever I thought was best. I-- I did say that, you're right. I just didn't think it would happen this fast. Well, you know me, I know my way around any musical instrument, but not cars. So, when this collector showed up, he offered to take great care of it, so I took him up on his off-- offer. I'm sorry. No, it's-- it's okay. I understand. You know what? I'm gonna-- I'm gonna-- I'm gonna get out of here. Why don't I come back and we can discuss what we have to, uh, go over. Ashley, it was nice seeing you again. You all have a lovely evening. Tony: Goodnight, Duncan. Here, let's just sit down and have our dessert, and, um, I'll make some coffee. I'm actually pretty full. I'm just gonna go grab my bag from the car. ♪ ♪ I was planning on telling you. [sighing] I was just waiting for when I would see you again. I get it. And you did ask me if I wanted the car and I told you to do what you wanted with it, so... Well, I hung onto it for as long as I could, 'cause I knew it had so many memories of your mother. It was like her very own Santa's sleigh. She'd get behind the wheel so happy and excited, and then off we'd go, delivering charitable gifts all over town. It made Christmas pretty special. It still is very special. Listen, I should probably grab my stuff from the car and you shouldn't be out here, hobbling around. Come on. No, maybe... Maybe we could get the car back. Let's just leave it as a memory. Come on. Still lighting up the town, are you? -Ashley? -Hi. Oh my gosh. What are you doing home? Well, my uncle broke his foot, so I came home to help him out. I saw that big boot of his when Beatrice had her singing lesson. Come here, give me a hug! Oh, it has been way too long. You know that, right? I know. So, are you still in the lighting business? I am, except the city also contracted me to help put up the decorations. You and Clayton? Just me. Clayton's overseeing a construction site out of town right now, but he'll be back in time for Christmas. What about you? Staying for the holidays, I hope. Uh, well, I told Charlotte I would, so here I am. But, uh... what is going on with these decorations? Triangle trees? What happened to all the traditional greenery and bows and tinsel? It's our new mayor. It's her way of bringing the town into the 21st century. But Robinsville was built in the 19th century, that's its charm. I know, but here we are. Look, I've got to wrap up a job installing lights at the market, but you and I, we'll make a plan? -Absolutely. -Good because I've missed you. I've missed you, too. I'll see you later. Bye. I think they're supposed to be Christmas trees. Really? I don't see it. Yeah, neither do I, to be honest. Christmas shopping? Getting a gift for my mom. Hey, I'm sorry I interrupted dinner the other night. You obviously have business with my uncle. Yeah. Hey, for the record, he had a hard time selling that car. Man's got a big heart. Runs in the family. So, as his family, you gonna forgive me for outbidding you? We'll see. Oh my gosh. What? I think that's the car. Well, Ashley... Ashley, hold on. Hey, I was trying to tell you, that's the mayor's car. She's got a thing for flashy new things. Yeah, I'm beginning to see that. You know, I helped your uncle sell the car, I drew up the bill of sale. I could track it down for you. No, no. It's fine. I just thought this was it. But it's okay, really. Well, why don't I pull it up? And I'll drop it by Tony's later tonight. Don't go chasing after cars. Gregory Lawson - that's who has the car. Chestnut Lane. That's out in Perth County, though, isn't it? It is. It's a couple hours out, but it's really not that hard to get there. Yeah, but why would this Mr. Lawson let me see what's clearly now his car? I'm sure he's a reasonable guy. Take Duncan with you. They've already met, so he might be more inclined to show it to you. That's a good point. It's a two hour drive. I could go as early as, say, tomorrow. All right. Then, tomorrow, we go see the car. Okay. [Charlotte and Tony chuckling] Good morning. All right, I got my car gassed up and ready to go. Actually, do you mind if we take my car? I mean, your car's a Mini and I'm not so, uh... I get it. Don't worry. All right. Hop in. Oh, festive. Yeah, I keep those in all year 'round. I just love the smell of Christmas trees. Hmm. [chuckling] Oh, you're, uh-- your engine looks like it's running a little hot. Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. I have an appointment for a tune-up this week. Let's hit the road. Okay. ♪ Ashley: This guy collects sleighs, not cars. [knocking] Hey, Mr. Lawson. I'm Duncan Morris. I helped facilitate the car you bought from Tony Warren a few months back. Do you remember that? Of course. It's nice to see you again. Nice to see you. And who's this? Hi. I'm Ashley Warren. My uncle's the one who sold uncle the car. Ah! We were wondering if we could maybe talk to you about that. Please, come in. Mr. Lawson: Here we are! Please join me in some hot cinnamon cider. Thank you. Mr. Lawson: You are most welcome. For a car collector, you seem to have a lot of sleighs. I'm not a car collector. I'm a sleigh or sled collector. You see... I'd heard rumors about a car that had been used to deliver toys at Christmas, just like Santa's sleigh. So, I did a little research and I tracked it down to your uncle. I just thought it would be a unique addition to my sleigh collection. Well, you're right. It really was like Santa's sleigh. Oh, were you part of the gift deliveries? I was, yeah, for many years. It's why I was hoping to be able to see it, since I didn't really get a chance to-- Say goodbye. Something like that. Well... I wish I could oblige, but I don't have it anymore. It seems, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get it to start. And then, one day, this fellow driving past saw it and I tell ya, the look of joy on that man's face... Turns out he remembered it as a boy. So, I surrendered the keys to him and he brought a flatbed the next day and took it away. You just gave him the car? No paperwork or exchange or anything? Nope. I just gave it to him. The look of joy on that man's face, the sparkle in his eyes, it lit up as soon as he saw it! I knew it was better off with him. Oh, but... I do recall his name was... Mark. No, it was... It was... Marcus. Marcus. I think-- no, no. It wasn't Marcus. No, it was. It was Marcus. I think it was Marcus. Okay. That's a lead. It wasn't Marcus. It was Martin, that's what it was. It was Marvin. You know what? Thank you so much, Mr. Lawson, um, for taking the time and for the delicious cider. Oh, well, it's my pleasure. Listen, if you do end up thinking about that guy's name, please give me a call. Oh, of course, I will. Oh... Thank you again, and merry Christmas. Well, thank you. Merry Christmas to you, too. It was great apple cider. Oh, good. Well, that was a bust. Yeah, unless he remembers that name. Yeah, no, you're right. That was a bust. [chuckling] Yeah. Ashley: Uh, do you smell something funny? Duncan: Nope. Just the sweet smell of my Christmas tree freshener. [hissing] Uh... that's not good. Yeah, we should, uh, maybe find a gas station. Yeah, you should definitely pull over. Okay. [coughing] When was the last time you had a tune-up? I don't know. A year? Maybe more. I didn't even notice the light was on until you did. Well, now, I know why your radiator's overheated. Maybe someone in here might be able So, no luck yet? Still no luck. Hmm. Well... my next student has just decided that he wants to learn the recorder, so... So, time for a break. Mmm. I read you loud and clear. Okay. -Yeah. -I'll see you later. -All right. -Good luck with that. Thank you. [car door closing] Hey. What are you doing here? Just hear to drop something off for your uncle. Oh. He's actually inside, teaching a lesson. -Oh. -Yeah. [phone ringing] Oh. Sorry. One sec. Hello. Yeah, this is she. Oh my gosh. Really? Are you sure? Of course you're sure. Yeah. Yes, that would be great. Thank you. Thank you so much. I think I just found the car. Where's it at? At Griffin's tree farm. Okay. Come on, I'll take you out there. Oh, uh, in your car? Oh, no. Not this time. If you're coming, we go in my car 'cause I keep that thing tuned up. [chuckling] Wow. I haven't been here in years. Duncan: It's my first time, actually. Really? Where'd you guys get your Christmas tree when you were living in town? 'Cause for Robinsville folk, this is the place to come. Duncan: Well, when I was a kid, we would go on country drives and chop down our own tree. Ashley: Oh. Is that Ashley Warren? Ashley: It is. A few years older than I remember you sitting in that car you called about. And you're a few years older than I remember you binding up those trees for us. And here we are, all grown up. Well, for the most part. And you are? Oh, I'm sorry. This is Duncan. He's my uncle's lawyer. And friend of the family. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Well, my husband's in the field right now, but trust me, he knows all about that car of yours from the stories I told him. Well, thank you for letting us come out and see it. You haven't seen it yet. Come on. I'll grab my coat and I'll take you out to the barn. Thanks. Nice guy. Very nice guy. I'm excited. Well... [sighing] Now, keep in mind, it's been weathering in the elements awhile and I haven't had the chance to give it the once over. Duncan, would you mind? Duncan: Yeah. Griffin: Now, I have to say... [chuckling] ...when I was a boy, we were struggling, after a couple of poor crops, well, the sight of this car pulling up to the farm on Christmas Eve was like... watching Santa's sleigh land on the roof. It was really something special. So, is it everything you remember? Yeah. Well, here, hop in. Ashley: Thanks. Oh, and I brought the keys, in case you wanted to try starting it up, but I have to warn you, I haven't been able to get it to turn over since I got it. [exhaling sharply] [engine sputtering] Nope. No. I can't tell what it is. I've worked on tractors and all sorts of farm machinery, but... I think it needed some TLC a ways back. But thank you for letting me try. [chuckling] You know, the gentlemen who gave me this car said he knew I should have it, just by the look of joy on my face, kind of like the look you gave when you first saw it. [chuckling] Except I think your joy goes a little deeper. Merry Christmas. Are you-- are you giving me the car? No, I wouldn't say that, considering it was yours to begin with. Wow. Thank you. I'm speechless. You know, you gifted a lot of happiness back in the day. I'm just happy I could pay it forward. But now, we gotta get it home and I don't think that little puddle jumper you showed up in is gonna be able to tow this baby. We're gonna need something bigger. Yup, she's secure. Good to go. Great job, man. Thank you. Matt, I-- I don't have the words. Enough said. I'm just happy she's back with her rightful owner. Thanks. And hey, thanks for the trees. Yeah, though, um, I'm not sure why something needs 12 trees, but, hey... I've got a little something up my sleeve. So, we'll see you back at the house. Yeah. Ashley: Ready? I'm ready. Good thing you like the smell of Christmas trees. [chuckling] ♪ Well, I'll be... Christmas just came home to Robinsville. [flatbed horn blaring] Thanks, Matt. Tony: [chuckling] There she is. Just like she always was. Yeah, only she won't start. And she's in need of some serious restoring. All details that can be worked out, starting with a good cleaning. I think I still have some wax and some leather polish here somewhere. I, uh-- Oh, gosh, are you okay? Yes. I promise, Uncle Tony, I can manage. [chuckling] All right. I, uh... I know she's in good hands. So, I'm gonna leave the two of you-- or I should say the three of you-- alone. Please, you don't have to stay and clean. You've done so much already. Are you kidding? I love the process of bringing antiques back to their original glory. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Anything that means that much, it's gotta shine. Agreed. So, why don't you fill that bucket up with some water? -And I'll grab some cleaners. -Yes, ma'am. ♪ Wow. Now, it looks like it always did. Yep, almost like new. Except you missed a spot. What? Where? Right there. Where? You gotta look real close. Okay. All right. I'm not falling for that trick. All right. You smell that? Ginger snaps. Come on, I have a feeling Charlotte's baking. Duncan: Told you. [chuckling] Ashley: Was I right? Are those ginger snaps I smell? [chuckling] Yup. [chuckling] I figured we needed something to celebrate. That's right, to the return of the car and my niece this Christmas. Duncan: All right, I should head home and leave you to your festivities. Not so fast. You, my friend, have been a big help with this whole car search, so stay, have a glass. Can't say no to that. Besides, now we have a fourth for the Christmas Game. [laughing] I haven't played that game in years. I figured this would be a great time to bring back old traditions, wouldn't you say? I hope you guys brought your game because I have the luck of the dice. Well, I don't mean to boast, but I got my own little board game win streak going on right now. All: Oh! I sense this is gonna get rowdy. All right, so, what are we playing for? Ginger snaps, of course. Okay, let's do this. Ashley: Okay... Not bad. Oh, you get a card from the Candy Pile. Ahh... "What would you get in your stocking if you were naughty, not nice?" A lump of coal, of course. [chuckling] You got it. Not that you ever had any coal in your stocking. Right. Oh... All right, Duncan, you're up. Okay. Come on, Santa, Duncan needs some lucky sixes. [Ashley chuckling] All right! Now, if you get this right, you've got a whole lot of ginger snaps to take home. I'm ready. Ashley: Ready? Okay. "What would you traditionally "put on top of a Christmas tree?" "A piece of fruit, a reindeer, or an angel?" Fruit. Say "fruit". Fruit. [chuckling] It's an angel, of course, and I'll even tell you why. Angels are considered to be protectors and messengers. And, if you're lucky, they'll bring you a message of joy that you won't ever forget. Uh... yeah, that's right. I think you won. [Tony and Charlotte chuckling] Well, Duncan, your winnings... Well, I'll let the house keep the winnings, but I will have one for the road. Okay. Here you go. Thank you, and thank you again for a beautiful night. Oh... No, no, no. Goodnight. Goodnight. Okay, great. Thank you so much, Vince. Hey! How was the singing lesson? Your uncle says she has the voice of an angel. I think it's a voice only a mother could love. [chuckling] So, what did the mechanic say? He didn't find any major work, other than replacing a rusted tailpipe. What's not so great is that he couldn't figure out why it won't start. Then, I'd start with that tailpipe. That's easy enough, right? Hmm. Not if I want to restore her to her former glory. But finding vintage is kind of my thing, so I'll find it. Yes, you will. Okay. Yep. Yep. Thanks so much. [beeping] I can't believe it - I can't find a single one. What about Duncan? If there's an antique in this town, he's probably appraised it. And besides, I need something delivered. What is it? It's a secret. You'll find out soon enough. The address is on the envelope. All right. I'll see you later. [knocking] Oh. Hey, Ashley. Hey. I'm just dropping this off for my uncle. It's the, um-- yeah, what is it again? I see what you're up to. It's not gonna work. Lawyer/client confidentiality and all that. He also mentioned that you might be able to help me find a vintage tailpipe. Oh, I don't know about that, but, uh... I'll look into my books and see if I have any estates with old cars. Thanks. Is this thing temperature controlled? Yes, it is, to keep everything in mint condition. Keep your hands off the class. Thank you. Do you even know the story behind this bell? No, I don't, actually. It belonged to the wife of a farmer. He spent his days herding sheep with his sons. And then, one Christmas Eve, a winter storm blew in, and they got lost trying to find their way home. So, the farmer's wife stayed up all night, ringing this bell, until, finally, the sound of the ringing led her boys home on Christmas morning. That definitely makes you see it in a different light. Yeah. Here, have a seat. Thanks. That's why I love antiques - for the stories behind them. Is that the only reason? That, and that we get to hold on to these precious few objects that means so much, even when so many other things in life just leave us. Any luck with that tailpipe? Yeah, um... No, I'm not seeing anything here. I'll just keep searching. Why don't we have it made? There's a metal worker down at the Christmas market. We can see if they'll do it. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay, let's go. It's the middle of the day. These are holiday hours. Want the tailpipe? -Yeah. -Let's get it. -Okay. -After you. [People chattering] Ashley: What is that and where are all the carolers that usually serenade the shoppers? Well, that sounds like a question for the new mayor. Ah, more out with the old, in with the new, huh? Something like that. Here we are. Wow, these are amazing. Thank you, and all made from old scrap. So, is there anything in particular I can help you find? Uh, there is, actually. I have this old 1960s car that needs a new-- well, rather an old tailpipe. Is that our famous old red convertible that's rolled back into town? That's the one, although it's not really doing much rolling around at the moment. Hm, leave it with me. I'll get it done. Great. Okay, great. Thanks. I mean, I can leave you a deposit. Don't you worry about that. I know all about that car and the good it did. So, you just come back here in a couple of days to pick it up. Thank you so much. My pleasure. Can you believe that? Wow. It's like the car is bringing out this, like, amazing Christmas spirit in everyone. I noticed. I have an idea. I think I know how to get her attention. Do you want to help me? It involves grabbing your car and waiting until nightfall. That sounds covert. Very. Alright, I'm in. Okay, let's go. ♪ Ashley: Perfect. Nice and quiet. Yeah, I still don't know what for. All I know is we got a couple of cars full of trees. Robinsville used to have real Christmas trees decorating the streets, not these weird triangular things. I mean, I get that they're new, but that doesn't mean that they're better. As Charlotte says, "Why change a good thing?" Right? Alright, let's get to it. Do you wanna help me with this one? Yeah, let's do it. Okay, well, that should do it. You're right. This is the way Main Street should look. The only thing that's missing is a red convertible coming around that corner over there. Hey, listen. I noticed the last name Morris in one of my mom's old log books that had the names of the families that we used to visit on Christmas Eve. Was that your family? Yeah, that was us. Hey, listen. I got some paperwork I bailed on earlier. I should probably get back to that. Of course, and thank you for humoring me. Yeah, I had fun. I wish I could see the look on the mayor's face when she sees all this. Me, too, but she's kind of like Santa Clause. I can't seem to catch her. Well, don't wait by the fireplace. I doubt she's coming down the chimney. Goodnight, Ashley. Goodnight, Duncan. ♪ Hey. There you are. You know how to install this now? I will figure it out. Well, in case you're having some troubles, I added some wings. Oh, that's perfect. Thank you, and merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, and I hope I get to see that car again. We'll see. Bye. Take care. Make sure nobody finds this. Keep this in a safe-- Ashley: Uncle Tony. Nothing. What are you two up to? We were just talking about-- -Paperwork. -Football. It's a fantasy draft. Yeah, paperwork about football. Oh. [clearing throat] What are you doing? Yeah, what do you got there? Uh, this is the brand new, yet vintage tailpipe. I'm dying to get it on the car, but my mechanic's all tied up on another job. Well, that's not a problem for you. You know your way around four wheels. Well, I know some things. Why don't we do it? We? Yeah, you know, you just tell me what tool you need, I'll-- I'll hand it to you. [laughing] Great idea. Okay, let's give it a shot. Duncan: Yeah. Okay. Come on. -Grab your coat. -Okay. [sighing] Wrench. Thank you. [grunting] Almost. Almost. Okay, one more pull, I think. Okay, I think I got it. Alright, let's see if this tailpipe brings us any luck. [engine sputtering stalling] [sighing] Well, so much for angel wings. Anything? Nothing. [engine stalling] I just-- What could it be? I mean, Vince said that there didn't seem to be anything wrong. Don't give up. Give it another try. [engine rumbling] [laughing] I don't believe it. Well, you know what this means, right? We need to take this baby for a ride. Yeah, buckle up. [laughing] ♪ Duncan: Wow, she drives smooth. Like a sleigh through snow. Ashley: Just like Santa's sleigh. Duncan: You know, you look right at home behind that wheel. Ashley: Yeah, feels pretty good. ♪ Duncan: Think you'd let me drive this sleigh one day? Ashley: I don't know. I've driven with you before, remember? Duncan: You gonna hold me to that forever? Ashley: I don't know. We'll see, we'll see. ♪ Well, she still has the same pep to her. You really missed this car, didn't you? There's a lot I miss. Is that it'd been so long since you came home for Christmas? It just didn't feel the same after my mom passed, and, I mean, my uncle did keep the charity alive with the toy drive through the church, but I never took the car out again. And then, after I moved to the city, I would come home for the holidays and it was just a reminder of what Christmas used to be. I guess the stories behind some antiques are harder than others. When I was about five, my dad lost his job. And it was tough for a few years, but not during Christmas, because every Christmas that car would come rolling down our street, full of gifts. It would bring me, my sisters, my entire family so much joy. But it wasn't the car that I was watching for, but the girl sitting in the car next to her mother. She looked just like an angel to me, and when we moved, I thought I'd never see her again, but here she is. So, as hard as some stories might be, maybe they're not over. Maybe they're still unfolding. And eventually, maybe they'll have a happy ending. [radio turning on] How did that just-- Duncan: I don't know. ♪ Christmas in the air Well, it's gotta be something with the electrical, right? Yeah, that's gotta be electrical, for sure. Okay, well, just in case, I think we probably should get it back to the garage. Uh-huh. [engine rumbling] Okay, well, I'll have Vince come and take a look at the wiring. -Alright. -Okay. -Let me help you with that. -Thanks. Well, I'm honored to be able to go on the inaugural ride since the car's been back. Well, I'm honored that you shared your family story with me. Yeah, but to be honest, those few years we struggled is probably the reason why I value things in a more material way. You're doing a good job of changing all that. I'm happy to hear that. I'll see you later, Ash. See you. ♪ Hey. Hi, Ashley. [sighing] ♪ How was the drive? Amazing, actually. You know, I was thinking, maybe I should do it again. The toy drive. What do you think? I think if you do, Robinsville will be the most joyful place around this Christmas. There is one problem, though. My mom would start fundraising for all the gifts we needed to buy right after Thanksgiving, and we only have a few days. What should we do? We can have a Christmas bake sale. That's how we'll do it. We can get the whole town into it. Charlotte, this is incredible. Thank you. No need to thank me, because just like everybody else in Robinsville, I was hoping for the day that car would get back on the road. Now, I'm going to get going, and when I get back, I want you to have some help here to get baking. [phone ringing] Sorry, this is a friend from work. I gotta take this. Oh, yeah. Sure. Gabby, hi. Ashley, I'm standing right outside of that shop you've been eyeing, and it's just gone up for lease. Do you want me to send you the realtor info? Yeah, sure. Why not? Okay, I'm sending it right now, and if I were you, I would get on it, because it's not going to be available for long. Yeah, no, I will definitely look into it. Thanks. And hey, I'll see you when I get back. Okay, bye. Bye. Hannah: Sure looks like we have our hands full here. [Charlotte laughing] Oh, there she is. I wasn't sure if you'd pull yourself away from that car. I'm just making sure it's in good shape. Oh, let's be honest. You love tinkering around in that garage, just like your mother did. And that's okay, but today, we have about eight dozen crullers to make. So, I'm putting you on glazing. So, Beatrice and I saw what you and Duncan did on Main Street. [gasping] Was that you? It might have been. Duncan and Ashley are a couple of little elves. Really? Your uncle told me you two took that car out for a drive. Oh, a drive? Actually, we did. It was nice. He told me all about his family, and... Both: And what? It inspired me. You know, to get the Christmas drive going again. Well, did it inspire you to maybe think about staying here in Robinsville? Well, I don't know about that. I mean, I just got a call about that shop I'm hoping to lease, and it just became available, so... So, maybe you'll find something here to convince you to stay. ♪ [sighing] Well, it looks like the last batch of crullers is ready to be boxed. Oh, no. Charlotte, you've already done so much. Please, I can take it from here. -Oh, sweet. -Mm-mm-mm. Crullers are ready. Yes, they are, but they're not for you. Now, we have another really big day tomorrow. So, I think we should get some rest. Goodnight, Ashley. Goodnight. Goodnight, angel. Goodnight. Okay. Oh. Oh, great. Can you put those on the table and I'll put them on a tray? Okay. -Oh. -Ashley: Sorry. [laughing] Hey, have you seen the petition going around? What petition? The petition to bring back all the traditional decorations to Robinsville. Almost half the town has signed it already. Yeah, I just signed it. Thanks to you two, this town's going to be kicking it old school again. I'll see you later. See you. Wow, I didn't know we'd start all that. Yeah, I hear that's not the only thing that's starting up again. You heard about the drive already? It's a small town, remember? Right. Well, I guess it's a good thing word gets out so fast around here, because if this drive is going to happen, we're going to need to do some serious fundraising. I can help you keep track of the numbers. That'd be great. Thanks. Okay. Well, then, let me buy one of these crullers so that we have something to eat while we tally it all up. [laughing] Take these. I glazed them myself. I might have gone a little overboard, but that just makes them better, right? Yeah, more sugar's always better. That's what I said. Charlotte: What would you like? I got scones. Lovely. Thank you. -Thank you so much. -Bye. Ginger snaps? Great. Great choice. There you are. Lovely. Oh, thank you so much. What would you like? Yeah? Okay. ...much! [laughing] -We're making a killing. -That's amazing. I mean, that's a decent number. Yeah, but it's still not enough to fund the drive. We'll figure it out. Hey, so, I noticed that my uncle got my great-grandmother's ring appraised. Well, he may have had it appraised, but you should know that ring is priceless. I'll say. Did he ever tell you that she got married on Christmas? He also said it was her favorite time of the year, and that was the reason why your uncle Tony and your mom loved the holidays which I guess got passed on to you, 'cause I saw that in you when we first met. What do you mean? I saw the look in your eye when I outbid you for the Christmas bell. I like the story behind it. Oh, so if it was just a regular old teapot you would have been just as disappointed? Well, I don't know, it depends on the teapot. Okay, what if it was a Santa teapot or a snowflake teapot or a Christmas tree teapot? Okay, alright. I might have a thing for festive antiques, but I mean, honestly, who doesn't love a Christmas auction? [chuckling] Oh, my gosh. That's it. That's how we'll raise the rest of the money. An auction. Okay, I'm sorry, I can't stay, but I got to make some phone calls, I gotta get Uncle Tony to book the auditorium. Do you think you could give me a hand setting it up? But where are we going to find the items we need for an auction? Don't worry about that. I got it covered. Okay, but we got to get the word out. Um, "Christmas On Wheels Charity Auction. December 23rd." Oh, my gosh. This is going to be so great. I'll see you later. ♪ Hey, Gabby. It's Ashley. Remember how you told me you could help me pack up my Christmas antiques? Well, I actually need them all shipped to Robinsville ASAP. [playing "Jingle Bells" on violin] Thank you. Great. Merry Christmas. [playing "Jingle Bells" on violin] Hi. Duncan: Hey, how are you doing? Good, yeah. This all for the auction? It is. So, we better get cracking. Where did all these come from? They are mine, actually. I told you I might have a thing for festive antiques. Just a thing? [laughing] Come on. Bravo. That was fantastic, Zoey. It's coming along quite well, wouldn't you say, Ashley? Yeah, it sounds great. See? There's no need for you to have any jitters at your recital. But, if you do... ...this is a German nutcracker that was built about 100 years before you were born. They're thought to bring good luck. So, here, take it, and remember to have it with you for your recital for luck. I'll walk you out. Merry Christmas, and hey, break a leg. [horn honking] Oh, that's Charlotte. She's here to pick me up for my, uh, choir practice. I'd really love to help you both with all of this, but, uh, have fun. Did you see the look of joy on that little girl's face? Now, that's the look you're going to inspire all over town this Christmas. [chuckling] I gotta tell you. This is actually a lot more than I remember. Yeah. But, all we have to do is go through everything, and then I'll write a short description for each item, and we'll be good to go. Okay. Do you want to take a little break? Maybe go for a car ride? [scoffing] I'd love to. [both laughing] One sec. ♪ [jingling] Now we can go. Duncan: You sure you're okay giving up all your Christmas antiques? Yeah, I think the reason that I was collecting them was to fill this void, and now I don't feel the need to do that, and sharing them makes them feel more alive because of all the new stories that'll be created. Oh, my gosh. Mr. Cooper's train set. It's still here. [Duncan chuckling] This was my very most favorite memory of the charity drive. Coming to Mr. Cooper's toy store and buying up all the gifts we would deliver. I still have a toy train from one of those years. You do? Yeah. It's my most priceless antique. That's sweet. I should probably get home and start writing up those descriptions. Yeah, I got some work I gotta wrap up. I thought you said you were working holiday hours. Or were you just playing hooky? Oh, maybe a little bit of both. That's weird. The headlights are on. Oh, great, and a bulb's out. That's gotta be an easy fix. Well, you'd think, but it's got to be one of these old bulbs. Well, maybe we can find one in town tomorrow. I hope so, because I can't be riding around like this on Christmas Eve. Or now, although I have a feeling that if you got a ticket, this car would charm its way out of it. Just the car, huh? I guess you can be pretty charming, too. [chuckling] [engine rumbling] ♪ ♪ Okay, Vince. Thanks so much for looking into it for me. -So, any luck? -Nope. No old bulbs at the car lot or the scrap yard. You? No, the dealership says they won't be able to get one in time. Okay, uh, bulbs. Who would have a collection of old bulbs? Oh, my gosh. Of course. I can't believe I didn't think of this already. I know exactly who would have one. Come with me. There's my lighting lady. There's the two of you again. Yeah, we were just gettingOh, we was just helping me with the thing for the-- for the car.the stuff for the car. Which is why I tracked you down. I actually need a headlamp bulb for my mom's car. Wait, hold on. Give me a sec. ♪ Okay, so Clayton thought I was nuts for hanging onto all these, but he did a garage reno for a couple who bought a house in Pembroke, and this guy, you know, he never threw anything out. I mean, his garage was full of old things. You would have loved it. He just, you know, had all these bulbs, and this might work for an early '60s model. Hannah, this is incredible. Thank you. Well, I knew there was a reason I should have hung onto these. So, do you need a hand installing it? Oh. [scoffing] She's--I think we got it. Yeah. But I think we should probably run because the Christmas Eve countdown is on. Don't worry, we'll all be watching. -Thanks so much. -Take care. See you. Alright, should we try it out? Yeah. Alright, thank you, Hannah. Looks like she's good to go. You just called the car a she. Yeah, she's so sleek, and stunning, and one of a kind. [chuckling] You know, I should probably charge this battery one more time, just in case. Okay, yeah, um... Maybe I'll go by the auditorium. Make sure it's ready for tomorrow. Great. Thanks. Goodnight, Ashley. See you tomorrow. ♪ ♪ Alright, this is the last box. Oh, great. Wait, but these are your antiques. I know. But all the proceeds go to the charity drive. I know that, too, and I'm okay with that. Only, I didn't bring the angel bell. That's just way too valuable. This is really generous. Thank you. That car has a way of making people pay it forward. This is my way of doing that. Who's going to lead the auction? -I should. -I will. I didn't realize you had any experience being an auctioneer. I don't, but I know how to address a room. At least a courtroom. Why don't we hold a mock auction? We'll see how you both do. I'm okay with that. We could, um, pretend to auction off this Santa. I love games. Let the bidding start at $20. And, go! Alright, the bidding is starting at $20. Do I hear $20? $20. I hear $20. How about $22? $22. Santa deserves a little bit more love than that. Can we get a $25? $25 over here. Guys, we can do better. Come on. $27? Do I hear $27? $27? You got money in your pockets and I know you want to spend it. Can I get a $$30? $$30 over here. $$30 going once. $$30 going twice. Both: $$30. Sold. [chuckling] Hey, why don't you do it together? It'd be more fun that way. She's right. That might be kind of fun. I'm game. Sold. [chuckling] Charlotte: Oh, we'll see you tomorrow, Duncan. Bye, Ashley. Okay. Now we're done. So, what are your plans? You know, after Christmas. Uh, well, I guess I'll go back to Seattle. I mean, Robinsville is great and holds a lot of memories for me, but, um, I think I'd better get back to the present, right? Yeah, right.
