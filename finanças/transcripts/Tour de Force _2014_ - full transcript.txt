Lambkin. Wake up. It's Bonking Friday. I'm too tired, Domi. Are you out of your mind? You said I shouldn't drink and drive! Just checking my mails, lambkin. Michael? Open up ! If you're just screwing someone else, I can give her some advice. It's not worth it. You are the lowest of the low. But I told you... - No. You texted me. You wrote me a crappy three-line message. OK, so I wrote. I wrote that I think we've... We've drifted apart. Sure. After six weeks. Michael, if you want to dump me, then at least have the balls to tell me face to face. Are you sure you don't want to come in? Are you seriously checking your mails now? 14 kilometres. - That's great. Are you coming back to bed? No, I was just taking a break. TOUR DE FORCE Morning. - Morning. Listen, lambkin... - I'll do the washing, then I'm off to the lab. Can you take Lilly to the ballet? Yes, sure. Listen, lambkin, about last night... - Did you phone Hannes? Yes. - And how is he? He sounded in great shape. He asked if the trip was still on. You need to check if my mother can take the kids. Soapnuts? Are you serious? Where are we going this year? I'd have been for Italy or Croatia, the romantic seaside. I don't get how you can go to Belgium for your holiday. There you go. - Thanks. Belgium. It's supposed to be really ugly. Is there anything else I can do for you? Well... You know, I'm not a prophet or an alchemist, and I haven't even read the Bible, but I'm quite well-versed in the art of clear thinking, even though others say, life is elsewhere. I think it's like kicking the hornet's nest. "YOUR PLACE OR MINE" It's some kind of ritual. Each year, one of them gets to decide the destination. When I think of the helmets and those stupid romper suits. Cycling trips are the most exhausting way to look crap. So why are you going? Because of my brother. Hello? Great, we're coming down. They're here. Are you coming? I'll just be a minute. Take your time. Morning. Good morning. Is Finn not here yet? - Of course not. How slim you arei - What? Are you feeling better? It only took the doctors a year and about a thousand tests to find out I'm actually fine. Hi, long time no see. Good that you can make it. - You insisted. What about.. what was her name.. Birgit? No, you mean Britta. Britta? - She just wasn't right. Sure It lasted how long? Four weeks? We said eight. - What time do you call this Finn? What's up? Hi Dominik, how's it going with the ladies? Brother, dear. - Morning. A tandem? Did that come free with couples' therapy? It's 548km to Ostend. We want to pay Jens a visit and have a proper drink, so let's go. Who's first? I'll go first. - Oh God. I heard that. Shall we get you a ladies' bike? Mareike, you're totally hip. What did you expect? - I don't know. Some cheesy pop song, I guess. Are you drunk? - Of course. I thought you listened to cheesy pop. Hannes? - Yes? Why Belgium? - Why not? Have you been there? - No You? Yes, once. We did some research, Belgium is full of waffle munchers and truffle fuckers. The Belgians invented fries. And Tintin. And the smurfs. - And the smurfs. And Jean-Claude Van Damme. - Exactly. Truffle fucker. Why is Jean-Claude Van Damme a truffle fucker? How big would the truffle have to be? Damn Wait upi You had to be cool and ride a rubbish bike. Dude, that bike is vintage. These things happen. Where are the nuts lambkin? Why don't you check in your shorts? In the front left compartment. Left! Man Shall we stop for a bite? What? - There was a pub back there. We only just left. Who's in favour of stopping? Domi, you lazy bastard. - My bum already hurts. Who wants to ride on? I don't mind. - Two against, three in favour. To our trip. Let's do it every year again from now on. - Definitely. Two apple juices, one mineral water. Can I borrow your pen please? OK listen up the tasks! Can't we leave them out? Why? - They're fun. Who's paying for these? - I am. But then I won't sit next to Mareike. - Why not? I'm not going to run through a meadow barefooted or catch glow worms in a jar again. That is Waldorf school kiddies' crap. Thanks. I'll put something nice. If I want to do something, I'll do it, I don't need a task. Although, hang on, I've always wanted to beat up a Jehovah's Witness. I know something else you've never done. What's that? - Pay a compliment. Nice one. PARACHUTE JUMP You got to. No way. - Yes, of course. It's compulsory. Now it's your turn. You'll like it. I didn't know you're into this, I like it. Why what did you write? I don't mind if it's sexual. - You would like that wouldn't you? Very funny. It's not even spelt correctly. - Of course it is. My spelling is top. Why that? - Don't you know what it means? Of course I do. - What did you write? That's none of your business. It's secret. There you go, lambkin. What did you write? Oh, now you want to know. I can't read it. It's really easy to read. - I can't. Come on, Mareike, where do you come up with these cheesy things? It's just how I am, leave me alone. What was that about? What? What you wrote down for me. Are you trying to tell me something? No, I just thought it would be funny. What's funny about doing something illegal? Well, it's supposed to be a challenge for the other person. Finn wrote something stupid for me as well. What did he write? It's supposed to be secret. A gangbang. A what? A gangbang. It's basically a variant of group sex whereby several... Yes, I know what a gangbang is, Dominik. Why did he write that for you? Well, I don't know. Are you annoyed now? Come on, lambkin. It wasn't me who wrote it. You don't think I'd actually do that? You're not serious are you? Finally! Where have you been? Hello, old man, you've gone grey. Hey, Mum. Hello sweetheart are you OK? - Mum! What are you doing here? Felix! Tidy your room and off to bed Fresh supplies. Man, when I see you guys like this, I'm doubly mad about my damn leg. No, thanks. - Just one. Come on, it's a special occasion. - No, thanks. Not for me either. - Come on, man. All right then, just a little sip. That's plenty, thanks. I'll get a drink Do you want one? - Yes, please. You're still up, Felix. Off to bed now, come on. It's past your bed time. But I want to play with Uncle Hannes. You'll see plenty more of him. Come on now. Good night. How did you do that? Hannes always wanted to be a nursery-school teacher. Sleep well, Felix. When are you two joining the club? I need some back-up in the playground. And I want to be a godfather, dishing out lollies and stuff. Micha. Did I miss something? What's wrong? Hello? Can someone tell me what's going on here? I'm getting worried. Come on, please tell them. What is it? Hannes, please. I have ALS. What? I have it now as well. Is that the crap your dad died of? Yes. Life expectancy three to five years, incurable. How long have you known this for? Two years. It's been going downhill for the last six months. But why are we going on a cycling trip? There's more. There's a reason why Hannes chose Belgium. Because... You have the option there... Hannes wants to die there. Assisted suicide. You don't really mean this. And we're supposed to be a part of this? Cycling, camping, writing funny things on beer mats and then watching you die at the end? Am I the last one to find out? - You could have called. What? I'm sorry. It was a bad idea. You should have talked to Finn. Maybe you can reconsider? Mum, we've discussed this a thousand times. But it's still too soon. For me or for you? Hannes, when your dad was in the condition you are in now, he... He still had over a year left. And how was that year? Was it worth it? Yes, it was worth it. And... I can say this because I spent every hour with him, washing him, feeding him... - I don't want to be washed or fed. I'm grateful for every second, it was also nice for us. And it was nice for him, too. Because he didn't know where it would end. I know where it will end. After his diagnosis, he did 20km on his exercise bike every morning. Six months ago, he failed to make the distance for the first time. It's been going downhill ever since. Each day, it's a few hundred metres less. In a few weeks' time, he won't be able to hold a glass anymore. And at some point, he won't be able... to breathe on his own anymore. I already fear every morning that he may have suffocated in his sleep. But you can't let him do this, Kiki. Do you really think I... I've been to all the specialists, trailed the entire web, I even saw a miracle healer, but, apart from painkillers and a breathing spray, nothing can be done, nothing at all. This disease only takes one direction, and that is deeper into the shit. But I know... how much he cares about this trip with you. We're leaving at eight in the morning. And it would be great if you would join us. Let me help you. - No, thanks. It was always a stupid idea not to tell them anything. What were you thinking? We arrive at Ostend and you just say "I'm off then"? ,. "It was nice being with you"? Look. This is for Dominik. The ticket from that stupid Iron Maiden concert when I almost lost my hearing. This is for Mareike, to acquire some taste in music. This is for Micha. Kite string, to stop him from stealing mine. You didn't tell me. This is for Finn. You're not talking to me. You don't tell me anything. You don't tell anyone. I don't want to talk, Kiki. I just wanted to hang out with my friends one last time and not think about this stupid disease. They're not idiots, Hannes, they see you're not like you used to be. Well then, everything's just great. Mum's gonna give us a lift to Ostend. No one will want to ride with us anymore anyway. That luggage belongs on the bikes. We're cycling. We need to hurry, we've got some catching up to do. And we're going to have an absolute blast, I promise. Where's Finn? He said he can't do it. Well, then I'll see you... in Ostend. I told you that Hannes is going on a journey do you remember where to? Yes, to Belgium. That's it. Would you like to wish Hannes a safe journey? Safe journey, Uncle Hannes. Thank you, Felix. Look! Look, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you, I just didn't know how. And I made Mum promise not to... - I don't need this right now. You gave up before it even began. That's exactly why I didn't tell you. Because you have no idea. What? I was there I know... - You were five years old! You know what? If you're so sure, maybe I would have preferred not to know. What's keeping Micha? Did the ATM draw him in? Shall we get the bill? We could go for a drink somewhere. Would you like to? Sure. - Of course. We'd love to, but we weren't sure... Or we could have a drink here... What is this? That's wicked! BE A WOMAN FOR ONE NIGHT Are we having a blast or what? Thank you. Look at that. I'm Jochen. - Mia. Can I buy you a drink? Sure why not? He's buying me a drink. Because I'm super hot. You're not from around here? - Frankfurt. So you must find this place mega provincial? I'm afraid there's nothing else in this town. Don't worry, it's fine. But if you like, we can go to my place and party on there. I'm not sure about that. You're into playing hard to get? Listen, Jochen, to spare you the embarrassment, I'm not a woman. Yes and? I think you misunderstood. I'm a man. Yes, of course. I mean, that's obvious. Oh no you mean you're straight? That's just great. The bill, please. What's wrong with you? - Pardon me. Nice get-up. Do you get off on that? What do you mean? Hanging around the ladies' room dressed up as a woman. No. - Is it a bet? Kind of. My friends wanted me to feel like a woman. So what's it like? My feet are killing me and I really want a cubicle. Welcome to the club. What gave them the idea? You have a problem with women? - Me? Not in the slightest I see. Mind if I touch these? Go ahead. Mind if I touch these as well? We'll have to wrap it well. Good morningi Please meet Biene, or Sabine, you can choose. Morning. - Hi. So when do we start? I've got to pick up a few things and borrow a bike from a friend. Doesn't matter, I'll be quick. Wow, a buffet. I'll go get some food. Go right ahead. Unbelievable. What happened to you last night? You'll have to pay extra for her. We'll take it out of our travel kitty. - No, you'll pay that. Are you out of your mind? - What are you doing? What do you mean? - You can't bring her along. She lives near the Belgian border and was visiting her grandparents here. It's clearly a sign. I love your idea with the tasks. He looked so crappy in that dress. Am I going to get a task too? Well, you can think about it for a few days. Delicious. I love salmon. You've been doing this for 15 years? I was only just learning how to ride a bike then. A cycling trip would never have occurred to me. I normally only get on a bike if the cross-trainer at the gym isn't free. But it's really great. Nature, the smells, the calmness, the quiet. Yes, the quiet more than anything. The world we live in is far too loud and hectic don't you think? Anyone wants a chewing gum? . Hannes you? - No, thanks. Anyone else? All right then. I love this chewing gum. It has little pearls that are good for your teeth. It's like brushing your teeth, it just tastes nicer. Do you always talk this little? Come on, just overtake me, please. We're going at our normal pace. Micha, come on. I can't go any faster with this trailer. Is this the snail mail or what? You're not seriously doing this? This is crap, Kiki. What am I supposed to do? - What's wrong with him? Why can't he get up that hill? Is he ill or does he have a problem? We'll never get to Belgium like this. I do have a task for you now, Sabine: just shut your mouth. I'll explain it to you later OK? Can you actually carry on Hannes? Are you OK? Come on, get on the back of the tandem. It's fun, you'll see. Say something! Oh man! You are crazy. Oh, man. I'm not dead yet. Stop treating me as if I was. I'm really grateful that you're all here. But it doesn't make any sense like this. Maybe we should just call it off. He's just torturing himself. Would you rather just sit at home and wait? I would try and get the best out of each day as well. It's the children. Beate? Finally How are you? We've been trying to call you. Yes, it rained here, too. They're still awake? Can you put them on please? Hello, sweetie, I miss you so much. How are you? Are you having a nice time with granny? You've been to the zoo? You should have told me. I'm sorry. I joined you because I fancied a few fun days. But what you're up to here has nothing to do with me. I'll take the train home tomorrow. Can't you stay a few more days? You're scared? Hannes will be better off in the place he's going to. How do you know? My dad died three years ago. I still talk to him every day. And what does he say? He doesn't say anything, you fool. He makes things happen for me. Turn traffic lights to green, or play his favourite song on the radio. And sometimes he sends someone to give me a hug from him. Breakfast! Stop shoving! Good morning! What time is it? Is there room for one more? We were just saying, you also didn't do your task. The official register still has open tasks from Finn, Dominik, Mareike, Hannes and Kiki. Did you know Kiki only slept with me because of this? Because of what? - His task. When? In Portugal. I thought it was that surfer. You screwed Hannes in Portugal? We didn't tell you so it wouldn't become weird. But I was already totally in love. I only did it because of the task. You are so mean. Do you remember how we met? Oh, I don't think I can remember a life before you. It was a joke, lambkin. - Very funny. Why didn't you sleep with me? That's why I gave you the task, to have sex. One time you didn't get your way. You'd already bedded the waitress. And her sister the following night. I couldn't tell them apart. I can name three other pairs of sisters you screwed as well. Sorry, Sabine. - It's OK. I'm not saying anything. Are you having both of these? Because you're unable to give me a task, I'm going to assign one to me myself. It's stopped raining. Shit! Have you hurt yourself? - No, I haven't. I'm OK, leave me alone. Let me help you. Come on, don't be stubborn. There you are, this is all completely mad. Right, this is the young man needing spiritual support. Don't run away, stay, stay. Your task, your Jehovah's Witness. Have you thought about God today? - No. Two punches to the stomach, one to the head, job done. Hit him. If it soothes your soul, you are welcome to hit me. I don't want to hit you. Of course you do, that's what you said, you wanted to hit him. Go ahead, hit him. Come on, man. Reconciliation is the basis of love. That's nice. Jehovah loves you. "Caribic nudie bar". What do you think Dominik? What you wrote for Dominik really hurt. It was just a bit of fun. But maybe not for us. Was that necessary? Do gangbangs feature in your porn? . "My porn"? Just because I looked at one thing on the internet. You know that's not true. This thing with the tasks is so cool, I think I'll do that every day now. Two euros! I think you're doing a great job. Maybe that's the wrong word, but... the thing with Hannes. I couldn't do that. On the day we left, there was a note in our letterbox. It was the invite to our annual backyard party. Hannes always used to organise benches from the school. Reading that note completely threw me, because I thought, shit, who's going to organise the benches for that stupid backyard party? I'm not coping very well. I can only think as far as that day, after it, everything goes black. I'd rather run naked down the high street. - What? I'll throw eggs at a police car, but I can't do this. Nothing can go wrong, honey. You know I'm afraid of heights! - On three. One... Well done, great trial jump. This was my actual jump, I've completed my task. Hannes I'm so scared! I'd rather run naked down the high street. I can't jump Hannes! You wouldn't even take on a grey-haired Jehovah's Witness. He just wasn't my type. You are such arseholes. What's that awful smell, is it the kitchen? That smell's so disgusting. It gives me the creeps. I thought that's why you drank so much. I'll take your shoes off. - Thanks. Are you OK? - Yes. Hey. I really love you, Hannes. Good night. - I love you too, man. You two are so sweet. Let me know if you need anything. I'm feeling sick. Oh God. Not now, please, I'm... Come on, Dominik, you stink. Life's too short for so little sex. That is so cynical. That is... You can join me in the shower tomorrow morning. Sure. I bet I still stink tomorrow or there's something else you dislike. Have you noticed that Hannes and Kiki never argue about such rubbish? Maybe that's because Hannes will be dead in a few days. Come on Dominik! That's disgusting I'm not discussing this with you, you're drunk. Who gives a shit? I'm fed up with it anyway. With what? With everything. This apple-pie, la-di-da, soapnut relationship. I don't want to live like this anymore. Do you understand? I want to drink alcohol again. I want to eat a burger now and again, and I want to sleep with my wife a lot more often. You know what? Just do it, then. Drink alcohol, but then deal with the hangover yourself and don't come crying to me. Eat a burger if you want to, but then get up yourself to get your heartburn tablets. And if you want sex, try and be a bit more imaginative than grabbing my tits and saying, "Mareike, it's Bonking Friday." You are not taking this. Yes, I am. I want to know how old you are. Fuck! It started with not having to show any ID anymore when going out. But only now do I feel really old. The same age as my mum. Would you rather have met me back then? - With this hairstyle? No way Why are you looking at me like this? Why are you looking at me like this? Do you have a member's card? I don't. Then it's 100 euros. Beer, prosecco and soft drinks included. 100 euros? Single men are 100 euros, couples 50 euros, single women under 30 are 10 euros and over 30, 40 euros. Is it possible to have a quick look first? Just to see if there's anything I like. No. Single men are 100 euros, couples 50 euros, single women under 30 are 10 euros and over 30, 40 euros. Why do women over 30 pay more? It's cheaper if you get a block of ten. No, I'm asking as a matter of principle. Why is this place discriminating against women over 30? Saggy tits, baggy pussies, how should I know? Good evening. Hello. Nice get-up. Thanks, likewise. Your first time? - Does it show? Would you like a drink to calm your nerves? OK, thanks. Jan. Mareike. I'm here with someone, so... No problem. Have fun. You too. Bye. I'm sorry. Yes, me too. Fuck! Please, you don't have to do this. You shouldn't remember your wife as a puking mess. I think it's only fair. Me as a cripple and you as a puking mess. Tomorrow, we'll already be in Belgium. I don't think I can do this. You all right? Where are the others? . Still in the shower. Listen, the task I wrote for Domi really was a bit childish. I'm sorry. You have guts. You do your own thing. You stand by your opinions, even against everyone else. I like that. Thanks. And you have a sexy mouth. Hey wait up! What do these guys want? Put that away. You two stay here and look mean. I wanted to ask something. Do you have anything on you? What do you mean? You know, stuff. Do you have any stuff? . What do you mean? Stuff? Stuffed animals or what? Listen here, sweetie pies. You have precisely two options: Either you empty your bags, or I'll call over my two colleagues, and we'll do an official securing of evidence operation. With strip search, finger up the bum, the full works. We're ready. Assumption of authority, coercion, possession of drugs. You're amazing. No way. Bye, Hannes. Be strong. Thanks. Belgium's right there. Come a bit further with us. I can't. I live that way. - Where do you live? Where do you live? Can I call you at least? . What for? I like chatting on the phone. - Sure. Take care, Micha. Bye. - Take care, Sabine. Ride safely. I'll give you a hand. Hannes? I got tested for ALS. I don't have it. I'm so sorry. Don't be silly. Top quality, Mareike. I think I did my task pretty well. Wouldn't you say? Domi, you're so quiet. You've got to be kidding. Guys, I'm going to pass out. Oh man, you can't stomach anything at all. Want something to drink? He can't take it anymore. We're getting old. You have to help me out a little. Your legs are so heavy. OK? I have something to get off my chest, before we all crawl into our tents. I spoke to Mum on the phone earlier on. She's picking us up in the morning, because... The appointment's tomorrow afternoon, and I won't get there on time. And I... I wanted to say thanks. For being here. For coming on this trip. You're the best friends anyone could wish for. Perhaps you'll do this trip every year. Just you... One week... I think that would be great. One more thing: don't let Mareike DJ at my funeral. And no stupid speeches, like "I'm just next door" or whatever. Please. Just... Just have a great party. We can manage that. - OK. Kiki? I can't promise you that. I don't know, maybe I'll give a stupid speech. Maybe I'll think you're just next door, and only that will make it bearable. I have no idea what I'll do on that date when you died. Maybe I'll hide away for a week. Maybe every year on September 24th... I'll just feel like shit. Maybe I'll just decide myself, after you've decided everything else. What would you want to decide Kiki? What is there to decide? I'd like to have shared it with you. You're leaving me alone. You're not dead yet, and I'm already all alone. How do you want to share it Kiki? Do you want to do it for me? I just want to know your feelings. Yes! You make an appointment in Belgium, get on your bike, and go and die. Done. I don't know... - You know. I don't know what you think, if you think about what comes after. If you're scared... - Scared? Yes. - Scared? I'm shitting my pants Kiki I'm going to die tomorrow. I'm shitting my pants. Hannes? You don't have to do it now. When should I do it Domi? When? When I'm in a wheelchair? When they shove a breathing tube into me? When I'm lying in my own shit? When? I'm 36 years old. I don't want to decide... Hello. My name's Gerricken. I have an appointment with Dr. Van den Berg. I'm afraid it's off. Dr. Van den Berg had a serious accident last night. Sorry, I couldn't call anyone yet. What did you want from Dr Van den Berg? To die. Who was your second consultant? Dr. Groteclaes. I'll see if I can get hold of him. Do we have your phone number? Are you hungry too? Hello? Gerricken Yes. That's right. OK, I understand. We'll call... We'll be in touch. Thanks. Goodbye. That was the other doctor. He has an appointment for you tomorrow. Wow. Kiki, when we were all sitting together earlier on, it was all fine all of a sudden. For the first time. My life... My life wasn't too long perhaps. But it was pretty good. Right? . We had a great time. You're doing it tomorrow. And... Yes. Shouldn't we maybe move inside? . Wait. I'm the only one who didn't do his task. What task did Mareike give you? To dance in the summer rain. - Shit. Hello? Come in please I'll be right there. Hello. Sorry. I'm Dr. Groteclaes, hello. Hannes. - Hello. Nice to see you again. I need to have a quick word with Hannes alone, but... then you have as much time as you need. I'll miss you. Take care of Mum OK? Are you sitting comfortably? . See you soon, my Hannes. I hope to hear from you. Get the bed nice and warm for me. I love you. I love you. You can sit there. It's fine. Hannes... We're going to start now. - OK. You know what will happen... - Yes. We discussed it. That's fine. The injection is ready. It'll be very fast from here OK? Here it comes. ONE YEAR LATER
