"AFTER THAT BALL" ART DIRECTION COSTUME DESIGNER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SOUND SOUND EDITING MIXING ORIGINAL MUSIC FILM EDITOR EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY SCREENPLAY DIRECTED BY I did my best. I found some recipes... Give me some of that rice. It 's nice and white. D?ris, when are you making that rice dish again? - Oh, everybody likes my rice. - You don't know what you're missing. Yes, I do. Several kilos of cholesterol and triglycerides. My father, may he rest in peace, died when he was 85 years old. He ate pork skin all his life. He ate, drank... lived to 85 years of age! He's my warranty certificate. D?ris, you really did a great job. I did my best when I made Ot?vio's diet food, too. You are a very nice person. Treating customers well is not only a pleasure, it 's a duty. I went to a wedding in India. It was lovely. There was an abundant amount of lovely food, D?ris. The food was perfumed. The families order the bride and groom's horoscope. If they're not suited, there is no marriage. There is still a great deal of arranged marriages in India... and even so the divorce rate is very low. Excuse me. Is it good? Perfect. Crispy on the outside, tender near the bone. Delicious. - This deserves a dance. - Fridays only, Freitas. Fridays only. The bingo was great today. It was crowded. No cheating. Don't cheat, Freitas. - Bingo is on the right. - Right. I'm ahead, four to two. - No cheating. - No, I'm winning. Four to two. What 's that score? Is it bingo? No, I keep track of the beers I drink, so I can pay D?ris later. - Is it bingo? - No... Today bingo is way ahead of India. I bet on India14 to 8. The game is going to turn around, you'll see. Well, Judith, did you win today? - Two lines. - And how many hearts? One at a time, D?ris. One at a time. - You know how to enjoy life. - It took a while, but I learned. Good night. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Her husband left home fifteen years ago. He didn't leave a note or a word. He took off, disappeared, and never came back. - Fifteen years... - Fifteen years. She spent five years locked in her own home. Never went out. Suddenly, she went wild. Now it 's one bingo after another. Bingo? - One more point for me. - Would you smoke away from me? For God's sake, Freitas. Pork ribs, beer, and victory. - I'm out of shape. - You'll never get in shape. Nobody wins at shuttlecock eating vegetables. What 's up? Do you know them? No. - How about another beer? - I don't think so. We better go home because it 's going to rain. I have some work to deliver. "And on that carpet of yellow, brown, and red... Garcia and Laura walked in an embrace. They were in love." Come here, baby, come. The year will be over soon, you'll graduate. My cousin will be proud. All you have to do is study more and go out less... especially with married men. Beth, you're still very young and pretty. - Some day you'll find... - "The love of your life." Why not? - "Love..." - What about it? - At your age? - Silly, I'm not talking about me. - I'm talking about you. - And I'm talking about you. You're always waiting around for perfect love. - No, I'm not, but a solid, mature... - Imperfect. They're all imperfect. Beth, didn't I tell you about my horoscope? "In the next months, significant changes will take place. Old dreams will come true." - Had I told you already? - Yes... last year. It just so happens that I still have fans. Yes, Freitas and Ot?vio. One is retired and the other is broke. It 's just too wonderful. Beth, it 's all a question of seasoning. Tell me something, Ot?vio, what 's this for? Cholesterol. - To raise it? - Yes, to raise it. Good idea. The pharmaceutical industry thanks you. These things are all weird. What 's this for? Hypertension. To increase it, too. - What about this? - For the liver. - And this? - Calcium. - And this? - Vitamins. - And this? - Antacids. That 's enough. You must be in very good health. If I took half the stuff you take... I'd be dead. - Are you sure you're alive? - I take care of my health. Actually, I'm going to tell you something. If you had half a brain... you'd take better care of yourself because after a certain age... Exactly. After a certain age, it 's all useless. Only one thing helps after a certain age. It helps. It helps... - What helps? - What helps? Living. What can you do? You can live. A woman like D?ris... has the same effect as all those pills you take. - I'm not a womanizer like you. - You should be. You take all that junk. Enjoying every day is what 's important... as my grandmother used to say... may God keep her in His holy glory. Enjoying each day is what 's important, and eating good food... and let 's get going because I'm hungry... and those ribs are waiting for me. Darling pork skin, here I come. You did it once. Now every Friday we have to do this. - Dinner and dancing. - So? What 's the problem? What would we do anyway? Watch TV? No... Freitas dances divinely. Try him out. - God forbid. - Why? He's a little over the hill, but he must have been interesting. Here. - Interesting? - I think so. Very interesting. Ot?vio... I didn't know you played the piano. No... I'm out of practice. I thought that was limited to the shuttlecock. This was my daughter's piano. I miss her so much. If you ever want to practice... ...you may use the piano. - It 's been so long. - I gave it up. - Gave it up? Maybe if you practiced... Wait... - Don't you dance? - I don't know how to dance, Judith. - That 's too bad. - Yes, it 's too bad. - More than you can imagine. - I do. You're really can dance, you know? - Don't you have a sister? - Why? What for? For Ot?vio. Look at his face. Beth, get me a beer. Loosen up your body, Ot?vio. Trust me. I trust you, but I don't know how to dance, D?ris. - Have some. - I don't want to. - Go on. - No, I don't want to. You should have seen how I used to dance. I know that you're a good dancer. I used to be the belle of the balls. I know. How come you know? - Loosen up, don't be afraid. - I'm afraid. - I'm scared you'll yell "Bingo"! - Bingo? Good idea! Hello? Okay. Okay. Jesus! Poor Beth. She's so young. Hello? You can't make it? I see. How about tomorrow? She won't give out to him, but spoils his dinner very night. He was studying to become a priest. He gave it up for a woman. - The one who called? - No, another one, some time ago. That was bad luck. It 's never too late to change your luck. It 's late. I'll be on my way. Me, too. - See you tomorrow at four. - See you tomorrow. Good night. I'll close it. Thank you. Good night. You dance so well... you cook so well... - I suspect something. - What? That you do everything very well, just perfectly. You're the perfect woman. Well, I'm so perfect... that I know how to disguise my imperfections very well. - You have imperfections? - Yes, I do. That 's better still. - Show me your imperfections. - No, sir. No way. - Let me see just one. - Freitas, here's your cap. - It 's time you left. - I just wanna see one. I won't tell anyone. It 'll be our secret. No! Good night, Freitas. - Good night. - Good night, D?ris. I'll see those imperfections some day! At first glance Passion has no defense You have to be artist To hold back It makes your legs tremble Beauty turns to Beast When someone you like Wants to approach you Just thinking about It Makes me feel happy We're just getting started And lwant more It arrives and spreads Beauty At the same time You're a lucky guy, you know? - Me? Why? - Well... four months ago, you used to have dinner at that restaurant. Now, you dine at the best private restaurant in town. I like you, Ot?vio. I've liked you since I first saw you. You're always so worried... and always so enthusiastic about carrots and veggies. - A role model. - Thank you. A role model to be avoided. Of all the districts in town you had to land here. You're lucky to have met D?ris, like her, come on to her... and what 's more incredible, she likes you, too. That old feeling has caught me. Memories... old memories... brought on by a sort of image of the past. Hang on! Who's the writer here? Don't you dare resort to lyric statements. My friend... have you ever thought what it would be like to go back in time... and recover certain things? It would be great to be young again... but there is no way I would relive the past, Ot?vio. I hate the past. I hate it. I want to go forward. Excuse me for asking, but are you divorced? No, I'm separated. I was never legally married. I used to be unconventional. Did you know that in India most marriages... are arranged by the parents of the bride and groom? Tell me something. What sparked your interest in India? I went there once with my husband. It 's wonderful. When he left me, I suffered a lot. Later I concluded it was the best thing he ever did for me. I used to like to cook... but nowadays I would not go without D?ris' cooking... because I enjoy the food and the company. I'm just like her. I hate eating alone. - Nobody enjoys eating alone. - True. She's very clever. She has company and makes some money, too... to complement her husband's pension. It 's not enough. - Hey! For me! - What? Stop it. Don't touch that. Don't touch that. They're for D?ris. To thank her... ...for the four months. - Four months already? Are you sure it 's just that and you have no ulterior intentions? The flowers are merely a nice gesture. - With no other intentions? - I've said I'm just being nice. I want to know because, if you're interested, that 's okay with me. - But just because it 's you. - What are you talking about? Don't you get it? I'm nuts about D?ris, as we used to say. For God's sake, Freitas... women are all the same to you, with the exception of Judith. - You can have her. - Thanks a lot. Do you think I didn't see you grabbing Beth? I did, but let her go quickly. I'm scared of her bad temper. I'm not scared of D?ris, though. What if I do have ulterior motives? - Now you're getting serious. - I'm always serious. What makes you think that I am not? Have you noticed how D?ris dances with me? Can't you see there's something going on? I've seen how you look at us. I even asked D?ris if she had a sister for you. Thanks a lot for your concern... ...but I'll have D?ris. - What? Listen carefully. As far as I know, she's available. May the best man win. Life, my friend, is like a shuttlecock. One day you lose, one day you win. D?ris is not a shuttlecock. - She's not something to play with. - Okay, okay. I'm happy to see there still are gentlemen in the world. I just want to be honest. I find D?ris a very interesting woman. She's hot. Fair enough. Be happy. I'll settle for the pork ribs... D?ris' ribs. Cheers. - To us. - To us. No, that 's water. People are always tied to the past... or thinking about the future... ...which means that they don't live. - I liked that. People live in the past. People are always tied to the past... Tied to the past. - Did you write that? - No, I heard it on the radio. I find that the truth often lies in simple statements. I'm happy to say that I find that some men... are still capable of surprising women. Yes. Mine surprised me even when he was in his coffin. He came back to life? Not quite. I disagree with Freitas entirely. I think... that in the past... we find some of the best things in our lives. - Or the worst. - Or the worst. That 's true. The freshness of a new discovery, however... is something that we can never recover... unless one of those small miracles happen. Hey. Who's the writer around here? That 's supposed to be my work. "Autumn in Belo Horizonte". I loved the book. It 's romantic and very touching. - Freitas, read for us a little. - By request... How many books have you published? Eight. - Published? - No, written. The true writer is not the one who publishes books. He writes books. That 's an interesting theory. "Standing in front of the mirror... Laura considered Garcia's proposal. He would not talk about the past. She would not talk about the future. They would concentrate on enjoying the present... always and exclusively the present. She often wondered whether she would marry Garcia... but how could he learn to live with her past?" Good night, princess. Nobody cooks like you do, D?ris. Nobody. Good night, Freitas. Once again, thank you very much for the flowers. You are a very nice person. Let 's go, Ot?vio. "Thank you very much, Ot?vio." "Do you know that you are a very nice man, Ot?vio?" "Thank you." - Are you feeling jealous? - Not at all. The game is just beginning. - We're just warming up. - Right. There's the first half, the intermission... - The second half. - Extended playing time. You know... that 's what we're going through now: The extended playing time. A lot of people think that we're finished. I dreamt that You were looking so lovely At a fantastic party Your ball gown I can still remember - Was whlte, allwhlte, my love - All whlte, my love The band played a slow Waltz I took you in my arms And we danced sweetly together To make you feel jealous I dreamt that I made eyes At someone else But you made eyes At anyone You only had eyes for me I felt that I had won you But It was just a dream And I awoke Quiet, Freitas. - This is alright, isn't it? - No, what is this for? - This is to tie it up. - It looks awful. For God's sake... - What 's this? A pocket on the side? - So what? What is it for? You look like a postman. How about this, Ot?vio? I like it. - Isn't it too tight? - No. Try to bend down. Damn you for saying that. I'm only trying to help, Freitas. I'm only... They're here. Attention everyone. We are announcing... that on the 7th of September, a national holiday... we will be celebrating and D?ris will be free for one day. The day after tomorrow I want you far from the sink and stove... ...and close to nature. - I think that 's a great idea. You are all invited as well. Everyone is invited. You never said anything about this. A surprise is a surprise, my darling D?ris. - Where are we going? - Trust us. If you don't trust me, trust that gentleman over there. He's always sober and does not consume cholesterol. Beth, are you sure you don't want to go? No. - Beth? - I already said no. Look at this young man's outfit. Go on, listen to him make fun of me. I want to see how you're doing when you're my age. - I am almost your age. - Now you're my age. You're clever. When it suits him, he's younger, or older. His age is elastic. You two are impossible, you act like children. Two children fighting over the same girl. - Invite Cosme. - He won't come. - Invite Cosme. - Do you want to come, Cosme? You don't. He never goes anywhere. Let 's go. - What 's this? - Our snack! Let 's go. Why didn't you go? I have to clean the house. Isn't the house clean already? - Chico. - Milton. - Elvis. - Elvis Presley? So what? Love me tender! Love me tender Love me true Kim Novak in "Picnic". S?nia Braga in "Dona Flor". Leonardo DiCaprio in "Titanic". - Leonardo DiCaprio? - Leonardo DiCaprio? What 's wrong with that? I like his hair. So what? Wait a minute. Circus. - Cotton candy. - Cavities. - Cavities? - Cavities? So what? Cavities? The birth of my daughter. The first time I saw the sea... and dived into the waters. It was in Copacabana. - Coming back from exile. - Exile? It 's been a long time since I went and I came back. He was subversive, didn't you know? Do you remember the word "subversive"? Who's subversive? I didn't know that. It was like seeing the sea Forthe first time That my eyes felt When they met yours I did not intend To fall in love lwas caught unaware And then It was too late When I realized what had happened I didn't try to run away Of the glue that trapped me In your eyes When I dived Into the sea's blue waters I knew that It was love And that It was here to stay I could paint the sky blue I could fill the universe Wlth the life I longed for All I did was to confess That lwas a slave To your love Free to love I haven't felt this good for a long time. Thank you very much. I'm the one who has to thank you for inviting me. It 's not just for today, D?ris. These last four months have been very... important to me. Thanks to me. If it wasn't for me... Thanks to me. You get along well, I mean... you fight all the time, but you stick together. That means you understand each other. There are other ways of getting along, without fighting... without talking... - Cotton candy! - Freitas! It tastes good. I tried it. It 's really good. Don't you like it? I could paint the sky blue I could fill the universe Wlth the life I longed for All I did was to confess The minute I went to buy cotton candy, you betrayed me. What? Do you think I didn't see? You kissed her. I didn't get around to it because you showed up. So, if I hadn't shown up... I took upthe blue sea All the blue in the sea It was like seeing the sea I could paint the sea blue It 's not about reliving the past, Freitas. - It 's about recovering a part of it. - A woman. A woman. A passion that your exile interrupted. When you came back, she had married someone else, right? Am I right? I knew there was a woman mixed up in your ideology talk. Why didn't you go after her? Let 's say that I did. Didn't she recognize you? Freitas, if she didn't know me, how could she recognize me? And it 's not one woman. It 's about a feeling, get it? "It 's not about a memory, it 's about a feeling." I knew it. Way down deep, you're romantic. You're on a diet, you have low cholesterol, but you're romantic. Let 's go before I tear up my book and your veggies get cold. Where? What? Knowing how to cook and dance saved my life. I always attracted all the men that I wanted. - All of them? - Let me see. All of them. I wish I had been that lucky. Why? So you could attract all the women? No, I wish you had attracted me to you. Can you imagine if we had spent all our lives together? Listen here, Freitas... a sweet talker like you... must have had all the women that you ever wanted. What do you mean? I only had one... ...and I married her. - Is she dead? She's been dead to me for ages, may she rest in peace. Hello? Wait a minute. Just a second. - Would you answer that for me? - Sure. Hello? What? A moment. D?ris, it 's an international call for you. International call? It must be my daughter. Hello? Johnny? Darling, how are you? Where? Wait a minute, let me take note. Hotel... No, it 's okay. Okay. Darling, I love you. I love you... Yes, I love you! Hotel... "I love you"? Holy shit. Ot?vio, are you sure you don't want a drink? Follow my example, partner, accept a little liqueur. Just a little bit. Oh no, don't drink it with an antacid. That is an awful crime. D?ris, tell our friend he takes too much medication. Doesn't he? Freitas, maybe he suffers from an affliction of the soul. What? Souls are from another world. Keep them away from me. People have soul. They suffer. They miss people, feel regret... A lot of things. I don't suffer from any of that. I don't believe in all that. When I wake up I read the bad news in the paper... but I know I can't fix things and I'm not giving up my ribs, my desserts... and my little glasses of liqueur. Someone left a CD with that song on it here. It 's a very old song. It must belong to Judith. "Because in India..." The fondest dreams I dreamt From a thousand chimeras A castle It 's a very old song. - It reminds me of... - What? I don't know. I can't remember. I just know it reminds me... something that I've forgotten... ...a long time ago. - Lf you've forgotten... it 's because you can't remember. And, if you can't remember, it 's because you've forgotten. I'm going to write that down before I forget it. Listen here, you two. You're going to have to carry on your chat at some other bar... because tomorrow I have an important meeting. Besides that tomorrow... I have to go to the store to do my monthly shopping. - It 's the Gringo. - Bingo? I don't like bingo. No. I'm saying... we have to join forces... against the attack from abroad. D?ris... if you like, we can do the shopping for you tomorrow. Really? You're so sweet. Congratulations, Ot?vio, congratulations. You drank like a man. You drank like a professional alcohol drinker. Freitas, what if I tell you... that I'm in love with D?ris... since a ball dance... when she and I danced to "Fascination"? - What would you say? - I'd say... that you are completely drunk. As drunk as a skunk on a full moon night... as my dead father used to say, may his soul rest in peace. He was a drunk, too. Then one fine day, Freitas, I saw D?ris. I saw D?ris walking down the street. It was a vision. A vision that hurled me into a time tunnel. Over... I felt thirty years younger. The two of us there... dancing to "Fascination". I felt just the same. She was lovely in her yellow gown. - Full skirt, can you believe that? - I believe... that you are completely drunk. Stinking drunk. You had five glasses of liqueur... which is something girls drink before they have first communion. - You're making up a story. - It 's true! Freitas, you have no idea how beautiful D?ris was. I had my eye on her... and that ball was my big chance. You know what? You sing in English because you're a snob. You traveled abroad and learned foreign languages... but you should know that the lyrics to that song in Portuguese... are much lovelier than they are in English. And in your eyes Dizzy from the emotion Wlth yearning A thousand ventures... Tell me something. How can you say "yearning" in English? I danced with D?ris, Freitas. I danced with D?ris. Wlth yearning A thousand ventures... - How come you don't dance now? - I'm traumatized. Traumatized. Traumatized? On my big night, I stepped on her feet. On both her feet at once. Holy shit! How did you manage that? On both her feet? - Hold me. Hold me. - I'm holding you. - Hold it. - Otherwise you'll fall down. - Let 's go that way. - No. I'm going this way. - You go that way. - You go that way. Go on. The fondest dreams I dreamt From a thousand chimeras A castle I built And in youreyes Dizzy from the emotion Wlth yearning A thousand ventures I expected Your body is light Seduction A divine poem Full of splendor What 's that? A suicide attempt? I'm ready for another round. Look. Look. Is this good? "No cholesterol." It 's no good. There's no taste to it. Whatever has no taste is no good. Okay. You're right. You have to admit that you're feeling jealous. There's one thing that I refuse to discuss. Two things, actually. No, three things I never discuss with my friends. You know what they are? Soccer, politics, and women. Respect the girl. Help with the packages. To you, she's just another woman, an adventure. - I suppose you're serious about her. - More than you think. How lovely, Ot?vio. Tell her about your deep, sincere love for her. Swear on the flag you have at home. - Are you afraid of the competition? - Not at all. Not at all. Time has taught me something. Women are great... but friends are sacred. What if I tell you that it 's all true... and that I'm really in love with D?ris? Ot?vio... in love with D?ris... for four months? For thirty years. Are you crazy stopping like that? What a pain the ass. Say that again. Say it again, because I didn't get it. I've been in love with D?ris for over thirty years. Over thirty years? The ball story happened over thirty years ago? For God's sake... I would be a coward if I got involved in a love story... that 's been going on for over thirty years. I thought that I was going to make it with D?ris. Ot?vio, only you would wait for a woman thirty years. Thirty years? You've loved this woman in silence for thirty years? What am I doing here, for God's sake? - I have an idea. Let 's bet. - What do you mean "bet"? Let 's go. I didn't want to come. We're behaving like kids. - Wait a minute. - What? - Don't be afraid. - What do you mean? - Stand still a second. - What are you doing? - Right. - Oh my God. It 's not what you're thinking or wishing it was. What 's that? We're going to draw lots. There are two names here. Yours and mine. The one that we draw first... has one month to win over D?ris. If he doesn't, it 's the next one's turn. Go on. Pick one. I thought you had already made it with her. So did I. I thought so, too. - Go on, pick a piece of paper. - I'm out. D?ris is not a prize. Don't be silly. Go on, pick one. Draw one. I don't think we're gonna have to bet at all. Take a look. Guess what? Better still. Go on, pick one. It 's getting better. It 's two locals against foreign capital. Go on, pick one. Okay, I'll pick one for you. Right. This one is yours. Go on. Open it. Open it. See what name is on it. - Is it Freitas? - Wait. Freitas? Freitas? You really are a lucky guy. Okay. You have one month to win her over. If you don't make it, it 's my turn. We'll keep it here. One month. Chicken stew is a divine meal, cousin... to be eaten while on your knees. - Guess what 's for dessert? - What? - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - I love that dessert! - I know, that 's why I made it! They don't have that in England, do they? They sometimes make apple pie, It 's not the same by a long shot. Cousin, how delicious. He had to leave Belo Horizonte over ten years ago. - Because of all the prejudice. - Here in Belo Horizonte? Yes. Now, he's legally married. They can do that there. - They can do what? - Get married. - Get it? - Yeah. Get what they can do there? They can do that there. Get it? Your rival is a member of the other team. You can relax. They can do it there. Cheers. I'm so happy you called, baby. I miss you so much, my love. How are you doing? You know who is here with me? Johnny! Yes! He's fine. No, baby. Mommy's thinking about it. At Christmas. Mommy's thinking about it. Okay, darling. Beth is sending you a kiss. Okay. God bless you. Send a kiss to everyone. I miss you so much. Okay, my love. Kisses. Oh my God. All mothers' hearts are the same. - I miss her so much. - I'm sure you do. Johnny's hardly eating and this is his favorite meal. Eat some, Ot?vio. It 's really good. Beth cooks, too. She makes very nice meals. One day, I'm going to let her make dinner on her own. You'll see. She's very modest. - You know, Mr... - Please, don't be so formal. Pardon me. I admire you deeply. You gave up everything and started from scratch... ...in the name of freedom. - Freedom must be won. - It doesn't just happen. - It takes a lot of courage. Yes, but sometimes there is no other solution. There is still a lot of prejudice around. A lot. I know that I can trust you. At my age, it 's very difficult to be free. Men don't want to use condoms. And without a condom, don't even think about it! What about AIDS? Knock on wood! The important thing is not to lose your desire... the possible feeling of affection. We always feel some sort of desire. When you don't fulfill it, you go window shopping... or go to a bingo parlor. Nowadays, people confuse sex with love. Yes, it is a sort of mixed up. Ot?vio is romantic. He believes in eternal love. He thinks that someone can wait years for a teenage love. Why not? His exile mentality freezes the city, the people, women. - Maybe. - It might have been. It might happen. Why not? Ot?vio plays the piano beautifully. Hi. No. No, I don't want to make up. No. You never understood me. See if you can understand this. I'm going to be very clear. I always wanted the best for you and for us. You managed to kill everything I felt... and all the good things I wanted for us. You managed to kill it all. I'm beginning to enjoy everything that is happening. I'm beginning to enjoy it all. Way to go, Cosme! You said it all. Doris, get a bottle of the best liqueur you have... in honor of my friend. He's not a friend, he's my idol. Cosme! Beth, come here. Ask Cosme to dance. He's a special person. He's a hero. - No. - He faces his foes... stands up to the enemy, challenges adversity... ...he's brave. - Stop it, I don't want to dance. Go. He's a rare man, like a military hero. And you can be his partner. Cosme, come here. Come here. I want to see this hero dance with this heroine. Give me that. Come here, come. Look. He's going to hold us up. No, why would he wait there? He's been there for days. I don't know. The house is left empty. Listen, Beth... I think he's looking at me, get it? He's waiting for the right time to hold you up. That 's not it. This is very odd. Do you think he's an admirer? He doesn't look like a criminal. Look at him. I think we'd better call the police. I didn't understand a thing. He asked me about Freitas. It 's not like I had a ton of women. No? How many times have you been married? Only once, formally. And that 's enough. And... hopefully, never again, God willing. - What about you? - Twice. Short-lived. That 's how I think marriages should be. Short. So short that you don't even need to get married. Do you know why my marriage did not work out? Because she was an alcoholic, oversexed nymphomaniac. I wish she had been. She was the most gifted and decent person... that you could ever imagine. Nobody could be more understanding. You know when candy becomes too sweet? That 's how she was. Unbearably sweet. If you're thinking of making the same mistake again... take some advice from me. Stay away from perfect women. - How about D?ris? - D?ris is different. D?ris is modern and positive. She'll face whatever comes her way. I feel so good when I'm with her. I feel good. You know why? Because she accepts me the way I am. She doesn't even think about commitment. Don't think that I've forgotten. One month. One month and it 's my turn. Then I'll play for keeps. - You can start now, if you like. - No. A deal is a deal, and a deadline is a deadline. Let 's see if you have what it takes to win the widow over... to bend her will. That 's five years of abstinence. Five... To our affirmative action man, Cosme. - How are you doing? - Freitas, neither here nor there. - Empty. - Empty can be filled. Order a plate of pork skin and another very iced beer. I can settle Cosme's problem with a rhyme. You must decide and not relent. Man forgets everything ever sent. You can forget anything and anyone. The important thing is not to back down. Hang on and the pain will go away. It will. Pain goes. It goes. It goes. The new team is ready, according to the coach. They won the game three-nil... when they played Saturday on their adversary's home turf. In the first half, Casagrande and Rodrigo V?tor scored... and Paulo Henrique in the second half. Wlth this result... Hi. You're here. I came to see how you're doing. You disappeared two days ago. Everyone is worried. You might need something... ...a nurse... - I'm fine. Everything's fine. I just came to see how you're doing. I'm fine. Thank you for your concern. - Okay. - Right. You put your shirt on inside out. So did you. Won't you come in? His name is Peixoto. He's great company. Like a cat or a dog? No, much better. At least you know where he is. He doesn't make a mess. He's very clean. In my time, in the middle of the past century, things were easier. Anyone who wanted to could date or get married. That did not ensure that you would be happy, though. It guaranteed you had a family. And company. Love is one thing. Sex is another. But sex with love is much better. Not always. - Not always. - I agree. I think so, too. I was slow to find out, but that 's it. I don't agree. With love... Nowadays some people court over the computer. - I wonder if that 's good. - It 's all very fast. You just click and everything happens. It 's faster than any patron saint. The patron saint of speed is the internet. - I don't know... - He looks like a drunk. - For someone who's desperate... - No, he's a Taurus. But he's looking for a serious relationship. - But I don't go with Taurus. - He looks like a drunk. Let 's see another one. This one, this one. I'm telling you. - He's twenty-four. - Too young. Look, "I like mature women". There's something I like about him. I really like his wavy hair. I liked this. "I want to meet a real woman... who knows how to take care of a peaceful man like me." I know how to do that. To all of us. Cheers! You're really bent on winning over the widow, no matter what it takes. Are you spying on me? Are you okay? What are you doing? - Free assistance. - Stop it, Freitas. - What are you doing? - Come on. - Do what I taught you. - You didn't. - Two steps this way, two that way. - Wait a minute. Two steps forward... - Shake your body. - Stop it. - You know how to shake it. - No, I don't. I'm going to fall over. What are you doing? Is there any bicarbonate around for the Cholesterol club new member? Beans and pork. Have you any idea how long? - How long? - Wow... - Today is an exception. - Don't say I didn't warn you. - You weren't motivated. - This is really good. I couldn't even remember what it tasted like. - May I have some more? - Take it easy, partner. I don't want to end up in a hospital tonight. D?ris, I'd like to ask you... if you'd accept to go out to dinner with me. On one condition. I want to have dinner and then go dancing. Dancing? Where? Anywhere. We can even dance here. Good luck, partner. Freitas, today a person was asking about you. About me? Who? A young man. He didn't say his name. Must be a collection agent. I owe a lot of money. If he asks again, tell him I moved. I'm living very far away. I don't understand. If he lost his memory, how did he find the house? He lost his recent memory. He remembers the far away past. - It happens. - God forbid. If I lose my recent memory and want to live in the past, don't let me. You can commit me, cut my head off, but don't let me. The past isn't a monolithic bloc. There are memories and... memories. Didn't she always say that freedom was the best thing in the world? You can never tell what goes on in someone else's mind. I don't understand. It doesn't make sense to me. Don't let it bother you. "Together. They were closer than ever... Laura and Garcia discovered the pleasure... of simple things. The gentleness of small gestures. An undefined joy... that was renewed every time they met. They missed each other so much when they were apart. After all, it had been a long time since Laura and Garcia... had enjoyed such a fulfilling sentiment, which was equally... so mysterious. They loved each other with the enthusiasm of youth... the power of people in love... and the illusion of people who think that the past... that old and well-known... ...past..." - Ant?nio Freitas? Ant?nio Olinto de Gon?alves Freitas? Excuse me. Sometimes you just can't take some things. I felt that my life was all wrong. That it wasn't what I wanted... and that I would die if I stayed. - So you decided to disappear. - I decided to live. Even if it meant hurting other people? What could I do? I felt like it was either them or me. Freitas, I can understand a man leaving his wife... ...but a son? - I don't understand it, either. I don't understand it, either. But I did it. Why didn't you look him up over all these years? I was ashamed. I was ashamed. Ashamed of being a coward, of not looking him up... ashamed for having left. Time went by and it got worse. I thought that we wouldn't have anything to say to each other. That we wouldn't even recognize each other. So I... decided to stick by my decision all the way. I gave up my son for good. How many bad choices a person can make in one lifetime. - You, too? - Me? Why? You are a careful kind of man. You think things out, you're well balanced. That can be a mistake, too. Freitas, look him up. Go and find your son. Try and make up for lost time. You can't recover lost time. And you know something? If I were him, I would have done the same thing. Look, it 's never too late to start over. That looks good when it 's written on a bumper-sticker. Life isn't like that. - I think that not trying is worse. - I don't know. Maybe it 's better to disappear for good. Why look for him? To say what? Freitas. Freitas? Are you okay? Yes! I'm fine! I'm going to pick up my pension, then I'll feel really good. - See you later. - See you. Why did you call? What do you have to say to me? Nothing, my son, nothing. Unfortunately, I have nothing to say. There are many things I'd like to say to you... but I have nothing to say. I mean, to justify. You won't remember, but one of the last things I did with you... you won't remember... was teach you how to play shuttlecock. I remember. Are they my grandsons? Lucas and Jo?o. Lucas and Jo?o. Are they good at shuttlecock? They will be if they have a good coach. - Quiet! - Let go! My money! They took my money! Are you okay? Hello? What? You cannot spend the night here on your own, Freitas. He's not going to. It 's too bad Beth's on duty tonight. I'm going to spend the night here with you. Not unless you get under this sheet with me. See, Ot?vio? You lost the bet. She wants to spend the night with me. What bet are you talking about? You never stop joking. You need company, Freitas. I agree. I agree. But I don't need a witness. You can leave, Ot?vio. Promiscuity is out at our age. Out, out. What amazing and terrible sense all this makes. A shitty father... a shitty teacher... a shitty author... a shitty retirement... a shitty thief... a shitty country. Ot?vio, come here. Find out if D?ris has a sister just like herself, for me. You know what? I'm tired of cleaning out the bird cage. I don't want to do it any more. Tomorrow I'll set them all free. Freitas. Freitas. Freitas. Freitas. A letter to his son. It looks like he had a premonition. He wanted... We have to find the boy's address. Look, "Ot?vio". "Ot?vio". What is that? "Ot?vio", "Ot?vio", what is that? A surprise from a friend. Aren't you going to tell me? Oh D?ris... I don't think he'd like that. Life isn't worth a thing. Sometimes it is. I get the feeling that I didn't know Freitas at all. He seemed like he was one thing, then he was something else. He was full of mystery and secrets. He loved life. You dream about doing so many things in your life... but you keep putting them off and putting them off... next thing you know... life runs you over. Did you dream of becoming a prosthetist? My father was a prosthetist. He taught me. Is that what you wanted to do? To make dentures? I wanted to change the world. Is that all? And know how to dance. Change the world and know how to dance. That makes sense. You're not going to believe this. I never missed one ball. Nor did I. But I lost a lot of girls because I couldn't dance. - Can you imagine if we had met? - We did. Don't you remember, D?ris? At a party, one night a young man, who looked like Che Guevara... danced with you and stepped on your feet so much... Wait a minute. You don't look like Che Guevara. The party was a ball at the club. - You were wearing a yellow gown. - I had... I had a yellow gown that had a full skirt. If I had danced with you, Ot?vio, I would remember. You didn't dance with me, I'm sure. - We danced to "Fascination". - "Fascination". "Fascination". Judith left the CD at home. - It wasn't her. - No? For all these years you have been such an important memory to me. When I saw you in the street by chance... I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. I asked the first person I met... if they knew of a house for rent nearby. That person was Freitas. He immediately arranged for a house, food... company. D?ris... you have no idea how much company a memory can be. Can you hear? Would you give me the honor? Here? As Freitas would say... life is short... and I have to tell you... that I'm in love with you. Since when? Since that ball when you wore your yellow gown. Ot?vio... You and your ball story. You really can't remember. No, Ot?vio... That 's impossible. The guy I remember... I danced with a guy...
