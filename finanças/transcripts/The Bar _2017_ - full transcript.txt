THE BAR Marta, stop calling, my battery's low. Something simple, that skirt and the pink sweater I wore the other day to dinner, remember? You don't? Were you that drunk? Listen, I've got some good stuff, top class. Shit no, it's only for you. But tell me now, I've got people on my back. Not tomorrow. Today, now. It gets me hot, but I'm not the buyer. - C'mon... - Move it. Don't fucking touch me... - You can't touch me! - Hello. A kilo of tomatoes and two kiwi fruit. - Any sweet onions? - Yes! No, not that. No. Hey, Chang, put it on my bill. See you. It happens, you meet up and he's not the guy in the photo. Wasn't there a show about a girl who got an amazing profile photo and bubbly fat gay guy shows up? Happens all the time. In a hotel, but I can't find it. I think I'm lost. It's cool now to meet up those "boutique" hotels - that sell furniture, tables... - Hey, sweetie... - It's lucky! - Oh, thanks. It's not a furniture store, Marta. It's a hotel... A pox and poison on you! May evil stalk you and your teeth fall out! May the devil turn your coffee to shit, bitch! No, some lady yelling at me, I don't know why. I'm not sleeping with him on the first date, no. Although, if that's really him in the photo, well... You're driving me nuts, Marta! Cut it out! Why don't you get a table next to us and send me a Whatsapp if you think he's cute. Marta? Shit, I got cut off. Hello. White coffee, please. Sugar? Saccharine. People are always coming in here to take a piss! If he doesn't order something, this mop's going in his face. Coffee, dash of milk, and saccharine. Hungry? Some churros? They're hot. No, thanks. "Hot..." You've got the hots! Get over to the grill, - I'll take care of the girl. - You don't have a charger for this? No, honey. - I don't understand those gadgets. - Hold on, I might have one. Amparo, a macchiato, honey. - What did you do to your hair? - I had it teased. Piss off. A meat sandwich? - Omelet? It's fresh-made. - No, thanks, I can't. Motherfuckers! You motherfuckers! Holy shit! Hey, shut up! Come here. You want me to throw you out? I got money. Put it away, Israel. You know your money's no good here. Behave yourself, eh? Go on, honey. - Nothing. - A shot and a fritter, please. Hey, Sátur, I ordered bread and tomato half an hour ago. Coming right up! - How about this one? - It's for a printer, or a computer... Oh! People leave all kinds of stuff here. Look. The other day someone left some X-rays. I have 20 minutes for breakfast and you always do this! - Yeah, coming. - I've got all morning. - The cart's already full. - People are pigs. - You lazy bum. - I need change. - You want 10? - No, 20. What about me? What do I get? My fucking fist if you don't shut up. - A sandwich? - Here, honey. She'll blow the 50 euros. What do you bet? She's always the same. Her husband works for the railway, she's at home alone all day... Oh, this one for sure. What do I owe? Coffee and omelet, 2.50! One second. We're all going to die. You will, having a shot for breakfast every day... Not every day. Sometimes we fix him a sandwich. - How can you let him in? - I let in who I want here. You don't like it, there's the door. Humoring him doesn't help. He should be put in a government shelter. Sure, all the shit goes to the government. Israel, hop in, I'll take you! I've paid the mortgage, but... I need a paper, the advisor told me. Look. I've got to go. The money's here, okay? - And the bread and tomato? - Give it to him. Right, see you tomorrow. - Will you leave the girl alone? - Sorry. - You just have to press it... - I don't think so. - Yes... - Can I get a macchiato? What was that? What happened? That guy got shot! - The bread and tomato guy? - Through the head! - Here was here a second ago! - Move, I can't see! Shit! Wait, wait. Why? I don't know, something's weird. Oh, my God! There's nobody on the street. It's true. Why is that? - Did a tile fall on him? - A tile?! - Off a wall, or the roof. - Nobody saw it. - It sounded just like a gunshot. - Good Lord. He moved! This is absurd! We can't leave him lying there! We have to help him! The police will deal with him. We'd better not go out. - I've got no signal. - Try down the end. He's bleeding out! My God! Oh, my God! "Blessed are the dead, for they shall see the Lord. And the angel with the sword of fire said... Shut the fuck up, you nutcase! No one's coming. What happened? Fuck this. - What are you doing? - No, don't go out! - We can't leave him there! - For God's sake! You alright? How you doin? - No! - On the floor! On the floor! - On the floor! - Everyone on the floor! Don't move! They might not know we're here. Sure, they can't see us from the roof. How do you know the shots are from there? Those people always shoot from the roof. - What people? - I don't know, - a crazy guy, a terrorist. - Some who flipped out. - What if he comes down? - Sure... - What if he starts gunning us down? - Like in Paris. That's why we have to lay low, until they come and get us. - Yeah - But who's going to come? The Police, paramedics... Someone, right? There's no signal. - You! - My name's Nacho. Terrific, Nacho. Got a cellphone? Call, and make it snappy. One of them has to work. What company are you with, Nacho? - What does that matter? - Some don't reach here. - They're all shit. - It must be the blockers. - The what? - We're next to the Tourist Board. Why would they use blockers? Can we shut up?! Fuck, they could kill us! No one tells me what to do! If I want to talk, I'll talk! If I want to scream, I'll scream! Jesus wept... - Fuck it! - What are you doing? Fuck it! - I got stuff to do. - What are you on about? In the church, I have to pass the plate. Where's he going? Israel, not now. I'll give you something later. Now stay still, can't you see we're thinking? Manuel will get mad. I'll talk to him tomorrow. Okay. Think of something. What if we put on the TV? Yeah, watch TV now... Is everyone stupid? To see the news. The girl's right, it'll be on the news. Nobody gets up! Any more bullshit, and I'll smash your face! Hey, a little respect. We're all human beings here. We have to stick together and stay calm. I've got the papers, the advisor gave me them. - Anyone seen the remote? - Is this it? The green one, yes. - No image? - No image. - You're shitting me! - It has to warm up. - Then it's fine. - ... for example, tennis elbow. ...stock market crash... Nothing? Two people shot dead in downtown Madrid, and nothing? - Maybe on the next edition. - It hasn't been reported yet. - They can't say anything. - If they say it's a terrorist, people will come for a look, like it was subway construction. - You think so? - Sure. For a good sauce... Maybe it's a robbery. The other day I saw a robbery live on streaming in this area. Jesus fucking Christ! - What is it? - This fucker's pissed himself! It stinks! Please! What are you doing? You're such a pig! That's disgusting. How can you do this to us? You can't do this, you can't! They're not there. Who? Who? The dead guys, they're not there. Frank and Jennifer are worried, there is a leak in their basement pipes. Look at it, the ceiling might collapse! The dripping pipes have soaked the beam that supports the structure. I'm frightened! Nothing is safe in this house. Everything seems normal and yet we could be dead in a matter of seconds! They deceived us. I don't trust anybody. - Everything is a huge lie! - Fixing the pipes... Why doesn't anyone come? If they took the bodies, they could've told us. Why would they tell you? They couldn't ask how we are? Anything, ask if we're okay... Sorry, I'm on edge. I just wanted to charge my phone, I don't come to these places. What "places" do you mean, honey? This kind of bar. Oh, look at you! This place too lowdown for you? They even took the blood. The pool of blood is gone. Look, cutie-pie, my bar's cleaner than any place you go, because it's mopped with bleach every day. Every day! It looks more like they just vanished. She just means it's bad luck, that's all. Shut up, I'm not talking to you. Maybe this... isn't what we think it is. That's for sure. I mean that it might be something totally different... - that we can't even imagine. - Like what? What if this never happened? What if we're dreaming? This is nuts. But who's dreaming, you or me? Me. Yeah, sure! And I'm part of your dream? Why not? I know you, you play the machines every day. I don't, just now and then. - Four days a week, like clockwork. - You're spying on me. - I notice details. - If we're talking crap, I'd rather be in bed and you're part of my dream. - Really? - Yes. Another thing it might've been, I didn't want to say, -is that they were abducted. - What? Idiot. You're not a dream, you're a nightmare. Someone took everyone away. Where are the dead guys? - Someone, like who? - Aliens. Or the government, experimenting on us to see how we react in extreme situations. Now they know how we react in extreme situations. And cut out this crap, you're scaring people! - You pack a punch, Amparo. - Weren't you asleep? - That'll make you snap out of it! - He's not talking crap. - The Government? - No, rethinking it. We assumed it was a loony, but maybe it's something else. Okay, let's take it point by point: Two people shot at random when they left the bar. - We don't know that. - They didn't get shot? I mean maybe it wasn't random. Maybe they were connected and we don't know it. Fuck off! What connects the streetcleaner and the clerk? - He worked in the bank on the corner. - So? Nothing, just that. They were shot leaving the bar. Who cares why? There must be a killer outside. - Or not. - If we start speculating... Let him speak. Maybe the killer's in here. What? I don't get it. Maybe the police are doing the shooting. - They don't shoot innocent people. - Why would they? Because they're after someone in here. There's a killer among us? A killer, a terrorist, someone too dangerous to let go. Dangerous enough to shoot anyone who comes out? Let's say it's a terrorist who's going to blow up a bomb when they come out. - That's why the street's empty. - They evacuated everyone. - And they don't know who it is? - No. Maybe they got a tip-off that he's in here to get a bag with a bomb. That could be. Bomb? What bomb? - There's no bomb in my bar! - Why don't the police burst in, put us against the wall and kill the terrorist? They know if they do that, the bomb will explode. Don't say that, I believe everything! However much I go over it, nothing else fits. It's impossible. They can't kill 8 people because they don't know who the terrorist is. I don't know if you get me, but this is insane. Think about it: Eight in exchange for how many? 200? 500? It happened in Russia. Fuck. For once he's right. Russia? I don't remember anything about Russia. Chechen commandos took over a theater. The police gassed the place and killed everyone. - The terrorists? - The hostages too. If the danger's that great, they won't hold back. Fuck everyone. But this is just talk. You're talking crap. How can there be a bomb in my bar? And if this terrorist knows he can't get out, we're all dead, these people blow up at the drop of a hat. He thinks he can still fool us. What's wrong? No, no. - No! Have we gone mad? - Please! - No! - Don't let go of it! - What do I do? - Don't touch it! Don't let go of it! No, no, no! Put it down gently on the floor. Are you crazy? There's no bomb! Tell them. - Do you know him? - Yes. No, I don't, but neither do any of you. - We're normal folks, but he... - I spotted him when I came in. He's the only one who didn't look after the shots. - I had my headphones on. - Can I put it down now? - It's gym clothes. - It's heavy for clothes. - Clothes, books... - The Koran, the fucker! You never know, some are Spanish. - They're not all Arabs. - Let me show you. Hold still. Sátur, open it up slowly. Why me? Out of the way, I'll open it! It's not that heavy. Let's see what's in here... There's nothing. It stinks! You were right. What's this? No! - What is this? - Don't touch it, Amparo. - It's a hard disk. - See? A hard disk! - Just clothes, eh? - It's like a computer. I work in a production company, ads for Campofrío, Nesquik... It's got all the ad campaigns. Like I'm gonna believe that. I don't believe this... That's it. - That was expensive! - Happy now? Fuck! There's no bomb! You're a bunch of babies! Babies! All of you! All this fuss because I've got a beard? You're right, Nacho. Forgive us. Forgive, no! You go quiet, hide your bag... What about that briefcase? - That could fit a bomb too. - Hold it right there. Whose briefcase is it? It's mine. No, no, we're not starting all this again. Please! The best way to avoid suspicion is to put shit on someone else. - What the...? - Hold it! - I'll report you. - It's not hard, just open it. - That briefcase stays shut. - Why? Because I fucking say. He just wants to confuse us. He's pissed off about it and wants to get at me. Open it, we look inside, then we won't suspect you. - Simple as that. - Everybody's happy. - Amparo, drop the briefcase. - No... - Let go of it! - Take it easy. Leave Amparo alone, you fuck! Now what, eh? You gonna hit me too? What the hell's going on here? Why have you got a gun? What's he doing? - Now we're screwed. - Loony, drop the briefcase! Israel! Go on, honey, do as the man says. Give me the briefcase. Go on, give it to me. What's he doing? What joy when they told me: "We go to the house of the Lord"... Now our feet are treading... You want to open it? - Open it and we're all screwed. - Shut up! - Ignore him, Israel. - Shit yeah... Fuck all these people. ...was founded... Israel, listen to me. - The tribes rise up... - Give me the briefcase. ...the tribes... - Give it to me, honey. - ...of... ...the... No. - ...Lord! - No! - What's this shit? - Yes, it's shit. Happy? Now explain the gun. What's that? - Someone in the bathroom. - He came in for a piss. - Unlock it! We can't get in! - Out of the way. Move it. Leave it to me. Move it, I'm going to shoot! Fucking drugs. - What's he on to get like that? - Some shit. I don't get why they come here. Why don't they go home? It's weird that he's not dead after the shots. I know what I'm doing. I didn't even graze him. He was a cop, but he was fired for drinking. His wife left him, took his kids. A mess. - We should get him out. - Yes. - Will you help me? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Someone's coming. It's a truck! - Thank you! My God! - It's about time! If we stay here any longer we'll come to a sticky end. Are they taking us away by truck? You want a limousine? I don't care what it is. What the hell are they doing? - Do we go out? - Not until we know what's going on. Thanks for before. Sticking up for me. If not for you, I don't know what would've happened. Thanks. - Okay. - They're going! - I don't get it. - They must've seen us! Hey! - Can't they see us? - What 's that? We're in the bar! Maybe we can go out. They're not shooting. No! - It's on the TV. - What is? The black smoke, on the TV. ...these images just came in... - Where's the remote? - Turn it up. They're going. They're going. The causes are yet unknown for the fire raging in downtown Madrid for some hours... It's a lie! There's no fire! It's a fucking lie! The police and firefighters, after cordoning off the area and evacuating residents, are now working - to stop it spreading... - So they used fires? So the TV can shoot it from the helicopter. This is insane. They invented the fire, the cheeky bastards! I don't believe it. They're covering up the murders. Why? What don't they want people to know? My God! Mister... Mister... - Mister... - Don't touch me! - What did he say? - I think he said: "Don't touch me". You're shittin' me. Fuck. - He's not breathing. - He's dead. Fuck. "And when the seventh seal opened, there was silence in heaven." Do we put him back in the bathroom? - He's military! - What? You can see him here, in uniform. - He's a captain. - How do you know? His insignias. - And people around him? - They're all black. - It's Africa. - It sure isn't Spain. We're screwed. "And the sun turned to darkness - and the moon to blood." - This can't be. It's obvious, now we're totally fucked. - It's an infection, a virus. - Fuck that! It's not an infection, it's incurable fucking killer virus! Ebola. That's why they cleared the street. And they shoot anyone who shows their face. It doesn't matter who goes out, we're all infected to them. - This is terrible! - They don't want us infecting anyone. - Why isn't it on the TV? - It's a cover-up. That's why they invented the fire! They brought it to Spain, and it spread. - They followed it to the bar. - But this happened before and they didn't hide it, it was on the news. It was controlled, the guy was quarantined. - Now it's out of their hands. - And there are eight of us. If we go out, no one can stop it. Why don't they just mow us down and fix the problem? Relax, they will if we don't die first. - Did he take an hour to die? - More or less. No, he was sick before. How can you all be so calm? - Are you saying we're going to die? - No. We're saying we're already dead. How much is this worth? 300 Euros. Damn. And the panties, well... I've got 5 Euros. Done, and I'll throw in a garter. We shouldn't allow this. I can't look, it makes me sick. Do you want me to say something? I will. If you want. Never mind, he's going. Married? Divorced. My wife hated me hauling lingerie around all day. It's a job like any other. Don't you believe it. I'd give her samples from the catalog. In bed I'd say: "Don't take anything off". She realized I liked what she had on more than - what she had underneath. - What you're saying is kind of... sick, isn't it? Everyone's got their kinks. Next! 1, 2, 3, 4. We should save the battery. How much is left? 10%. And no signal. Sorry... - I don't know your name. - Elena. Elena. - Nacho, right? - Nacho, Nacho. Nice to meet you, Nacho. What about you? I haven't been laid in years. Besides, I'm retired. - Do you miss it? - What? The job. You've got no idea. Sometimes I slept at the station because I didn't want to go home. My partners, life on the street, this... helping people... Trouble starts when there are too many opinions. In the end, this is the best. What you're saying is kind of... fascist, isn't it? Well, we have our kinks, right? I really liked your ad. It was yours, right? The Campofrío ad? I had the idea. But then there's... a director, you know. Sure. But the basic concept is mine. Remember? The kids, ham, the sheep... The sheep! That's right. Was it real? - No, it was 3D, a drawing. - It was very well done. Thanks. It must be fun, huh? Doing this... - ...making... - Don't you believe it. At any rate, this advertising thing isn't forever. I've got plans, you know? Really? What plans? That's a dumb thing to say. Plans... As if we could make any plans. I've still got things to do. - I'm not giving up the ghost. - No, sure. Me neither. Falling in love, for example. That's something... I still haven't... Really? You've never been in love? A girl like you, looking at you... I mean, I'm not saying I know you... - I don't. - You don't know me at all. - Sátur, get me a Ballantine's. - Don't! They won't pay! We've got 5 Euros. I want a Beefeater and tonic. At home I hold my arm out on the balcony to get a signal. - Let's try it. - I'll help you. How about some omelet? I'm not going to die. Why? Because you mop the floor with bleach? No. Remember his dying words? He said: "Don't touch me". And I didn't touch him. Here! I got a signal! What do I do? Call? - Call the police? - Not the police. They were the ones shooting at us! We have to let a paper or the radio know. I don't know the number of a radio station. Wait! Our media girl knows everyone. It doesn't work, it's shit. Cecilia, listen, I haven't got much time. - Let me... - It's Nacho, the Campofrío ad, with the sheep. Never mind. Something incredible's happened. You know the fire? Yes. There's no fire. She won't understand if you talk like that. We're trapped in a bar! People are getting killed! - Police, anyone, help us! - You idiot. Cecilia. Cecilia? Cecilia? She hung up. She thought it was some moron screaming... Don't insult me! She didn't recognize you. - Give it here, I'll call my wife. - Sátur, get down! People always listen to her. Give it to me. - The battery's run out. - You used it! Gimme! - Gimme the phone! - Please! - Give it to me! - No! - Give it to me! - The battery! Give it to me! A winner! Why now, when it's no use? Give me the phone, I know who to call. - Don't touch it! - Why not? It's the dead guy's phone. So touching the phone means we're infected? Straight up. And if I touch you now? I'll smash your face! - Mess with me and I'll skewer you. - You're crazy! We're not sure, but on second thoughts Amparo may be right, we should take precautions. - I'm sure I didn't touch him. - Me neither. - You did, you liar! - When? - Just now! - No, it was for a second. With your clumsy mitts: the body, the phone, everything! You can't be serious. - It's the facts. I'm clean. - Me too. Go on, call, it's the only phone with a signal. If you say you didn't touch him, maybe they'll listen to you. - With a handkerchief. - And "hands free" - to keep it from your lips. - That'll reassure them. Calm down, please. I'm sure that... Okay, okay, stay away! He definitely touched you. You'd do the same thing. I'm fine, I'm not sick. Yes, send two taxis. One for the sick, one for these fuckers. That's enough! Everyone in the corner! Quick! Jihad guy, put the phone on the bar. You'd better listen to him. It sounds bad, but it's just a precaution. We've been together for hours, touching each other. This is ridiculous. Don't make this any harder. I feel terrible, having to do this. Please... I've never heard anything so vile. I'm going to French kiss you, my tongue down your throat. - I'll stick this up your ass first. - In front of everyone, darling? Look out! You, Trini. With the others. You're enjoying this, huh, bitch? The coins are for us, they're full of virus. - Now what? - Open the storeroom door. 15 years working here, and you do this to me? Who told you to touch the body? How did I know he was going to die? I looked after you like a son. I couldn't love you more, you know that. - Now get down there. - Amparo... Amparo, schmamparo, you touched the body and I can't make an exception. You have to understand! "And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of saints, the blood of the martyrs. And when I saw her, I was appalled." Sorry, I don't understand what's going on. They're putting us down there. - Do I take the body down? - Don't give them ideas! If Amparo says to go down so we don't contaminate them... Right you are, Sátur. See? He gets it. - He's pissed off, but he gets it. - I'm just obeying. "He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it until the thousand years were ended." - I'm not going down there! - Okay. - You want me to pop you?! - That's not necessary. Get down there now! "Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the fornicators, the murderers..." Shut up! When you start in on the Bible... the idolaters and all those who practice falsehood... Shoot him. "The Devil, the Beast and the false prophet will be shackled and thrown into the lake of fire." Fucking shoot him. let's get this over with. "Whoever is to go into captivity, so shall they go. Whoever is to be killed with the sword, so shall they be." Hold still. There's one thing, then there's another. Israel, come here. Take a bottle. Take it. Go on, drink up. Go on, down there. Give me a good one. Drink it all down, all of it! Go! "And cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores..." Yes, Israel, yes. "...but they refused to repent of what they had done". Yes... Go. It's not very healthy to share our air with a corpse, but that's the way it is, you can't do much about it. He looked nice. At least in his profile photo. He had a Ramones T-shirt on. This is getting to me! I can't stand elevators. I always take the stairs, and this is so small. Shit! I left my iPad upstairs. - Who cares, right? - I was never lucky with guys. They were one night stands or crazy... or took no notice of me. I've never been lucky. My husband's a frog, not a prince. I saw my kids the other day. I was at church, begging. They passed by in front of me. Bastards didn't give me anything. We were going to meet in a little "boutique" hotel, to have a drink, eh? Don't think that... We'd see, you know? But my battery ran out and... ...you know the rest. People badmouth the machines, but they don't deceive you. You just have to persevere. If you try every day, they pay out. But all people have done is give me headaches. This looked bigger at first, huh? If only they hadn't taken the phone... Poor man. What must he think of me? Will he still be waiting? No? No. He'll have gone. He'll think I saw him and left. I live in the ATM now, but not before. I had two houses, one for winter and another for summer. I think. Or maybe I dreamt that, I don't know. That's what fucks me off most. Those three are up there, calling the police, saying it's under control and to get them out. I would've done the same. What? Don't give me that look. If I hadn't picked up his phone... I didn't touch that guy. Well, now yes, but not before. Look, Nacho, that man coughed, spat blood, touched the walls, the floor, the phone... If we're infected, so are they up there, and I want to think you wouldn't do a thing like that, because you'd have to be trash. And I don't like trash. I've got no air. I can't take it. I can't, I can't, I can't. I've got to get out of here! Relax, Trini. Relax. Don't breathe all crazy. Breathe deep, but controlled. Deep breath... That's it. Hold on. Breathe into this bag. You want me to inhale Corn Rings? Shit, tip them out and breathe into the bag. Please, leave me alone! Open up, you fuckers! We're suffocating! Open up! Sorry, sorry! I'll get down. Sorry, I'm really sorry. - Watch the glass. - For God's sake! It's just what we need now, to cut ourselves. - How come there's no liquid? - What? - There should be a pool. - It goes down the drain. What? - And where does it go? - The sewers. When it rains a lot, water even comes up. God, it stinks! It's not very deep. - We can't go in that. - Why not? It's disgusting, it's full of crap. - I won't fit through there. - Me neither. - I could. - Yeah, for sure. No, it's really narrow. "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven." - What's he doing? - He's not getting naked, is he? You smell worse than the sewers. Someone tell him to stop, he can't go down there. - Yes, he can. - He won't fit, it's impossible. The guy's thinner than he looks. Bastard sure stinks. But he's strong, eh? Yes, that might help. Help me, Sátur. Go! Yes. Rub it all over his body. Yes. Pour it on. - Let's go. - Go, champ. Go for it. Fuck... You're shittin' me. C'mon! Push his shoulders and his waist... C'mon. Go! - No way, he doesn't fit. - Push with your foot! Right... let me do it! Like this? Like this? Fucking harder! - You want it harder? - Yeah! Yeah! Son of a bitch! Yeah! He's stuck. Give me some oil. Here it is. Lift up your head. Over here, his waist! His waist? Nacho! You're drowning him. That's enough. - Here, Beard Boy! Quick! - Stop, stop! Push! Push, you fag! You got no balls! No, no! Stop it! Please! He won't go through. What do we do? Alright, pull. Pull! Nothing, not up, not down. He's in a vacuum, like a cork in a bottle. Shut up! Shut the fuck up! The wrath of the Lord has come. They're killing each other. No. No. People are coming in. What? Shit... Take it easy. They're being killed. The light, the light. Shit, shit... Shut up! What are they doing? You can't hear a thing. There's somebody. - I think they've gone. - What is it? What's that? What the fuck...? Fuck. Feel that heat? Fuck! They're burning it all down. What? To disinfect it. They'll roast us like lambs! We've got to get out! We've got to get out! Please! We need air or we'll suffocate in two minutes. We've got to get out! We've got to get out! The air in the sewers. - We have to get him out, now! - Give me a hand! He's stuck. You're suffocating me! You'll pull my head off! No, you're tense, relax your muscles. I need air. - Calm down. - I can't. Calm down. Look at me, look at me. You're fixating. - My clothes are burning! - Take them off! - Not in front of them! - Elena, Elena... - Help! Grab him here! - Help! You've got small hands, grab his underarms. - No. No, no. - God damn it! - Let's go. - C'mon. One... Two... What the fuck are you laughing at? Her nails tickle. Got a good hold? On three. - One, two... - And three! Poor thing. What was she thinking? I hear toothpaste is good for burns. That's Internet bullshit. The best thing is oil. If that sticks to the burn, it'll never come off. Got a better idea? It's the only clean thing here. In case you haven't noticed, that noise has gone. - Yes, and it's not as hot. - The fire must've burnt out. - I'm not touching the door. - Go over there. Alright... - What do you see? - There's nothing left. No bodies. They taped up the outside, you can't see a thing. There they are. 15 years working in this bar and now look at it. Shut up. What have they done? Amparo's pendant. Will you shut up? Poor gal... - She was such a bitch. - Please shut up. Never a thank you. Today wasn't normal. I don't know what got into her. Fear changes people. No, fear shows us what we really are. We're rats. All the rest is a lie. Why not rip the plastic and go? What are we doing here? What are we waiting for? Quiet. They're outside, we can't go. - You don't know that. - I just saw them. I'm taking that risk. I'm not. If you go out and get shot, I'll be next... I mean, all of us. Good. - Okay. - Okay. What do we do? Wait. - Wait for what? - Until we think of something. I can't think of anything, nor will I for a long time. God! Please... We have to lay low for a few days, that's all. Down there we've got bags of olives, chips, Coca-Cola. We can hold on until they forget about this. Or until we slowly die. - Does anyone feel sick? - Everything hurts. I mean a fever or something. I could have a 40° fever, but with the heat in here... Let's talk about this. Quiet, quiet. Quiet. What's that? What is that? - You hear it? - Yes. There. There I think it's over there. Yes! They're messages. What do they say? It says: "Are you alright?" Someone asking about him. Read the messages before that. "I swear, it works, I'm getting better". Fuck! Works? What works? - And before that? - "I injected one, - but it did nothing." - "Injected one"? - Who did? - The phone guy, the dead guy. Okay. Go on. It says: "Don't come. I'm hiding in the bathroom". - Keep reading. - Then it says: "I heard shots. Are you okay?" That was when they shot the streetcleaner. So while we were up there, he was in the bathroom sending messages. Read fast, go further back. "You haven't had a fever like mine for two days". "Shit no, trust me". "Okay". "They're following me". "No shit!" "I have to get out of here". "I'm almost there". I don't get it. He went into the bathroom to inject himself. So there's a vaccine. A serum or something. My God... My God, there's a solution! Yes! - Finally! - Yes! No. If there was a vaccine they wouldn't be killing people. - But this guy had it, right? - We have to read from the start. Right... here. "How are you?" "Fucked, I can't stop coughing." "It'll be fine, it's bound to be today". "What if they're right and it doesn't work?" "The nun made it". Hold on... "Maybe it wasn't the serum". "What else? Where are you?" "A bar in Mostenses." "I'm on my way. I've got four left." Shit, there's a serum, it worked on the nun. What nun? A nun's writing this? No, where it all began! In Africa, you idiot. The poor nun was helping over there and caught it. I don't get why they say they can't risk it. Maybe it's not tested, they're not sure about it, but I don't get why the dead guy and the other one had it. - It's better than nothing. - But he took it and died. He had a fever for two days. - And we don't have fevers. - No. We're fine. - Right. - Sure. Let's see if I've got this. Some guy outside says he can cure us. - What are you doing? - I got a fright. There's a message coming in! HIDDEN NUMBER - Answer it! - Wait! - What if it's a trap? - A trap? Answer it! What if they caught who wrote it and they're after this guy? - He's fucking dead! - They didn't see him upstairs. - I don't give a fuck. Answer it! - You sure? Fucking answer it! Yes? Hello? What's wrong? Shit! - What? - What? - The battery. - No! No way! - No! - Fuck you, you son of a bitch! - I screwed up. I did. - No! Just a second. What charger did it have? There must be a way. Maybe if we open it and put the wires straight in... What? That's not how it works. Let's go down before they see us. What if we put the card in another phone? This is the only one with a signal. The cards are different and we've got no adapter. And we don't know the PIN. Stop being a dick! I don't want any olives, chips or Coca-Cola! - I just want to get out of here! - What about whiskey? Let's get back down there, I'm begging you. I was thinking... What? - The messages. - I don't remember them now. - The nun? - No, no, wait. - The last one. - The first, you mean. - We read it in backwards. - Whatever. There are only four left. Four minutes? Or four doses. Go on, it doesn't matter. - Take a good look. - Shit, there's nothing here. - He must have them on him. - Unless... - Well done, Israel. - That's right, great. - You did great. - Yes. - Give them to me. - Hey, watch it. Cut the crap, Israel, we're screwed enough as it is. Let's inject it and see what happens, okay? There are only four. And five of us. - I told you. - Damn. I've got joy in my soul, great... - How do we do this? - Do what? We draw lots? Draw lots? I... I... - I don't get it. - One of us is screwed. Great joy in my soul... So... there's no other way? - It's the fairest thing. - Fair?! I've never won anything, the Christmas lottery, nothing. - I can't draw lots. - Right. Okay. We can split these four into five doses. - Yeah. See? That's much better, right? - That's true. No, we can't do that. We'd put everyone in danger. The amount must be measured. Measured? You can take twice that much. But you can't lower the dose. What's wrong with you? - But we have to share it. - They're single doses. Son of a bitch! Put that down! Put it down or I'll shoot! Where did you get that gun? - I found it lying around. - And he didn't say anything. - Why is that? - Yeah, how come? I just picked it up. He's injecting it! Do something! If you shoot they might hear us outside. Well, that's it. No... Scumbag. Now do what you like. God! Now what? Let him go! Stop, please, Israel! Please stop! Son of a bitch! I'll kill the first one to move! Your computer, your beard, but you can't fight for shit! You think I didn't know what was on your mind? Not enough to go around, so fuck the poor guy. As usual! - Please... - Not this time, you fucks. This time I save myself! So it's every man for himself! The syringes, get the syringes! Fucking stay still! That's what you get for being an asshole. - Oh, Lord! - Hold it right there! - I said don't touch him! - Son of a bitch! When he was hitting me you said nothing. It has to be someone thinner. Thinner and smaller. No. "The Great Whore, with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and its denizens made drunk with the wine of her fornication..." Can we cut out the Bible quotes? You, turn around. Turn around, I'm not going to hurt you! Humor him, he's drunk. Nice tits, not much ass. I don't know why girls don't eat, looking like those models... Anorexics. That's it. You like her too, right? C'mon, don't act goofy, I saw you looking at her. - Will you shut the fuck up? - She gets you hot, admit it. Here, drink. Fucking drink it! "Beard Boy", you ever tried oysters? They taste like these girls' pussies. You disgust me. Relax, woman, we're not talking about you. Yours must be more like... macaroni and tomato. Sorry. Go on, you can do it. It'll all be fine. Okay. Okay, okay. What's wrong? - My skin! It hurts! - Hold on! Can't you do it? - My skin's tearing. - Relax. It's just at first. You'll fit. You'll lose your feathers, like chickens. But don't forget: make it down or not, there are just three syringes left. Let's see what you do, because he's getting ideas. Right, "Beard Boy"? We have to get the gun. We'll see what we can do. - We have to get it. - Relax. I'll push you. It hurts! Relax, honey, you can do it. Fuck! - C'mon. - Can you do it? Go, slip through. Go, go. Look, and she never comes to bars like this. One, two... and three! Are you alright? Elena! I can't see her. Maybe the current took her. There she is. She's got them! Elena, tie them to the light cable! No. Did you hear me? Tie the syringes to the cable, for Christ's sake! I heard you, but I'm not doing it. What did she say? Elena, did you hear me? Fuck this. Elena, tie them to the light cable! No! When I get back up, there'll be none left! How could you think that? We're not all the same. We helped you get down! - Because it was good for you! - She'll shoot them all up. No, I won't, but I'm not giving them to you. The brat really fucked you over. I'm not like you, no. Then what do you want? - You have to come down here. - What? I can't, I don't fit! - Got a lighter? - Matches. Okay. Who goes down first? Do we vote? - Here we do as I say. - Or you'll do what? - Shoot us? - She's just like my ex-wife, - a real bitch. - Watch it with me, eh? Oh, yeah? Yeah. I don't know about your wife, but I pack a punch. Let's calm down. Hold on. Here, let me. - Fuck! - Keep going, it's still small. - We can't stay here. - I won't fit! I'll go and pull you from down there. Go on, Beard Boy, jump. Let's go. "...the Lord is with you, blessed art thou..." Relax, Trini, relax. Trust me! Raise your arms! Belly in and raise your arms! But don't kick me, please! Don't kick me! Hang in there! Hang in there! Trini, I'm falling! - Trini, damn you! - No! Trini, please, I'm gonna fall! Go, Trini! That's enough! Stop it! I'll kill you, Beard Boy! I'll kill you, you hear me? Stop it! Stop! Where are they? I don't know, I can't see them. I can't see them. - Where did they go? - What do we do? What are you looking at? - He was about to kill me. - Why do you have the gun? What do you mean? He... shot at me and I took it from him. Then he disappeared in the water. - You don't think I killed him? - I don't believe anything. But he was a drunken maniac with a gun! Fuck! Look, I don't care. Let's not go over it again. Let's just inject ourselves. Give them to me. The syringes, please, Elena. - We're still four for three. - I don't care! Pass them over. No. What? Throw away the gun, Nacho. We're going crazy. We are. Yes, we're going crazy. So throw away the gun, please. Elena... I know you like me. I saw it in your eyes when you came into the bar. This morning you saved my life. When those bastards wanted to fuck with me, you defended me. What the hell's up with you now? I don't like being threatened. Who the hell is threatening you? Fine. I know what you're thinking. Now I'm the bad guy, right? Fucking great. - If you throw the gun away... - I'm not going to! Now I'm the one who says what gets done, period. You're like him. Like who? That drunk you just killed. Yes, I'm like him, like you, like everyone. It's just some of us have a gun. Give me the injections. I don't have them. What? You lost them? No, I hid them. God damn... Please! Shit, that's heavy. I said I didn't trust you people, and in the end I was right. - Come here! - No! No! No! - Want me to kill Sátur? - You couldn't do it. No, no, no! Think for a second. If I kill him now, that's it, three for three. Trini... Maybe that's what you want. Right, Elena? I save you the trouble. It's not true. Do you know why I won't throw away the gun? I'm scared of you. And scared of this idiot too! Please, let's go. Come on, come on. It's over, it's over. - You sure you came this way? - Yes, I think so. - "I think so?" - I think so, I don't know. It was dark, I'm not totally sure. - Who'd let matches get wet? - What's that noise? Me. I'm dropping coins in case we have to go back. - Go ahead. - Okay. Come on. This way. Hold hands, you can't see a thing. First you point a gun at me, now you want to hold hands? Where are you going? Give me your hand. Don't push me. Your hand, your hand. I can't see. Don't let go! - What? You let go! - You're going to push me in! - Stop it! Who's pushing me? - I'm not pushing you! - Who fell in? - Sátur... or Trini. No, I'm here. Sátur, where are you? Say something so we know where you are! - Sátur! - He must be drowning! Nacho, shoot! So we can see! Shoot! You bitch! Let go! Let go, you crazy woman! Are you crazy? Get over there. There! Okay, I gambled and it didn't pay off, but it was for the best. I would've taken the blame alone, and you would've thought it was all an accident. I wanted to make things easier. Who cares, one or the other? No, Israel was a danger, not Sátur. A small difference. Will you stop talking about me like I'm not here? There's one too many... full stop. Why not you then, you fucking crazy bitch? What do you want to keep living for? To whine about your bad life? To put another coin in to see if you win? You know what she does every day? She turns her back on us. yanks the lever, ignores us... Shit, you only turn around to get change! At least I pull up the shutter, try to talk to people and say: "What'll it be, omelet, a short white"? And they talk to me, even if it's just about football. I ask about their kids, their wife, whatever. Sometimes I don't want to talk either! I make an effort and talk because we're people, not bloodsucking ticks! Sorry, I don't know what came over me. I'm not like that, I don't know what happened. She won't give you the shot... until this is sorted out, because she doesn't trust you. I told you, we have to share them. It's still three for four. Let's stop going over it. A decision has to be made, and it looks like you've made it, right? - Nacho, please. - Shut up. What are you waiting for? Go on, shoot. Go on. Shoot. Maybe this'll make it easier. I can't. Yes, you can, go on. I can't. It's okay, honey, it's over. We all have our faults. I turn my back on the people, but not because I don't care, I'm ashamed... to be seen. We all wanted her to do it, and now it's done. Now it's three for three. Can you do it? Two people have already died for this and we don't even know if it works. Hey, that's weird. You'll say I'm imagining things, but... ...what the fuck...? Why is she like that? No, no, no! Run! Go! Go! "And a voice came from Heaven and said: 'It is done'". Come here, Beard Boy, show your face! Come here, I'm gonna destroy you! Come on, up. - Do you know where we are? - No. - Run! - Keep going! You haven't got the balls! Coward! Son of a bitch! You can't take me on! Run, run! Let's go! Run, run! Where are you? This way, this way! Show your face, Beard Boy! Running like a rat. Come here, Beard Boy. I thought we were friends. You don't betray your friends... or shoot them, you bastard. I just want to talk, Beard Boy. Let's talk... and forgive each other our sins. There's no way out. - No way out. - Come on, Beard Boy. Just a quiet chat. We'll forget everything. Let's forget about it. - Where is he? - Shall we gather at the river, the beautiful, the beautiful river? Shall we gather at the river that flows by the throne of God? Come on, Beard Boy, all together now! Shall we gather at the river - that flows by the throne of God? - Stay low. Amen! Where are you hiding, Beard Boy? You and your bitch! Look at them, the happy couple. If it's a boy, call him Israel, like me! And if it's a girl, Trini, like the old duck! Bam! Right in the face! She had to kill herself 'cause you're a pussy I'm like God, I see everything! You hear me, Beard Boy! Why'd you shoot me? Why? We were friends! In fact, I helped you! Come on, come on. Go right. Go! Now, now! - I'm going to kill you! - Run, run! No! Bastard! Son of a bitch! Bastard! Keep going! Run! Go! Not yet, Lord! Not yet! - This way! - This final journey we'll take together, Beard Boy! - The boatman awaits us! - Run, run! The boatman's waiting for both of us! - Beard Boy... - Here! ...I'm here! It's a way out! Go! - Beard Boy! - I can't get up! Go on, up! Keep going. I'm coming up, Beard Boy! Hurry! Careful! - No! - No! Hurry! Up you go! Keep going! Nacho, Nacho! - Grab my hand. - Take it! Nacho! - It'll be alright. - You're coming with me! You son of a bitch, you're coming with me! Nacho! Help! Please! Help! - Let me help her. - No, who knows what she's done. Yesterday at midday the fire announced on the popular Mostenses Square near Madrid's Gran Vi?a, has claimed at least three fatalities. Elena? Translation: Lindsay Moxham Subtitles: LASERFILM
