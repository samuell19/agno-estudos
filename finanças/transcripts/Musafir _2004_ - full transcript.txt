I Paid 2.5 million to get rid of her I was only 12 when I came to live with my sister Angela She came to live in my house, after her Parents died The one who stood before me was a kid... but I could clearly see a woman in that kid's eyes I was only a kid, but the look Lukha gave me... ...made me realize that I Possessed the body of a woman She always found an excuse to touch me a sister-in-law is said to be half a wife But ever since she arrived, she tried to become my wife! Initially, when he fondled with my hair... I used to get a strange feeling. But I had to remain quiet Little did I realize that my silence would turn out to be my... ...worst enemy He always looked for an excuse to touch me Then I realized, that although man had emerged from the beasts... ...there are certain men who can never turn human and there came a day when she was no longer a child The sofa was sheer velvet, so was she, but I felt as if... I was lying on a bed of thorns Seeing me getting drenched, Lukha's intentions turned evil When she deliberately sprayed the water on me and drenched me... ...her smile appeared to be an innocent one... but I was the only one who knew that she was teasing me I used to be scared to leave the Pool Because I knew Lukha was eyeing me lustfully When she stepped into the Pool, she was well aware that... she was sizzling in the waters When she deliberately came toward me, I felt as if the water... ...was on fire I was all alone that night. Angela had gone out... but Sam was around She dropped not just the towel. She compelled me to drop my decency Sam! Sam! I fell deeper into it every day When I came out of the bath... I had no idea that Lukha's intentions had turned so evil... that he was lying in wait for me Shut up! Quiet! No! He not just raped me. He even violated my soul and one day... - Somin came in front of me. Lukha! I tried to make Angela see reason. But it made no difference to her. Sam had convinced her sister that I was taking advantage of her Lukha! Move! You raped my sister, you bastard! Hey! Don't talk any nonsense! I thought she was a kid and made her sit on my lap... it's your sister who dragged me to bed... ask her I swear it on you. Ask her... - Shut up! You don't worry, Sam. I'll call the Police right now! - No need to call the Police... This is a family matter. - Lay off! What've you been doing in the family? I haven't done anything, I swear! There's no Place for you in our lives anymore! You raped my sister! - Angela, hear me out... Leave me! You finished aB. Just wait and see what I do to you. Look what I do to you now... - Let me go... Let alone touching anyone else... you won't even touch yourself again! You're finished. Listen to me, Angela... - don't touch me! Angela went to call the Police and never came back Lukha had killed my sister When her car Plunged into the gorge... ...her death had decided my future She is cross with me now To torment me intentionally... to make a mockery of me... she Plays games with men When I walk the streets, People scoff at me do you think you are the first traveler who gave her a ride? If you really think so, then you are a greater fool than me That is why I want her dead So that her car never breaks down again... so that no one scoffs at me again Now stop reeling an emotion-Packed story Whether I must do your job or not, I'll give it a thought If I do your job, how will you Pay me? What are you doing with the Pistol? - Bad times. Tension anyone can barge into the house anytime rather keep a gun than worry Who could be a danger to us? - Why not? Think.

Sure, if you give me company Sam, listen Take it off. - What? Your brassiere. Come and sit here come on. - No Why not? Is there someone in the bathroom even tonight? Just shut up!

Lukha! Oh! No. Bloody idiot! Your wife and my money! You could take care of neither!

I don't know what to do The cop?s behind me, Billa's up ahead waiting for me, and... ...you're with me. Whose every word is based on a lie! - What do you mean? The first time we met, you didn't tell me you were married Second time, you told me about your childhood and Lukha and Lukha had a different story to tell Then you called me over to steal. And before I reached... you had killed him! And now you tell me, the dough... ...belongs to a cop who is Lukha's brother I have an answer to every suspicion of yours Had I told you I'm married, would you have stopped? Lukha gave you a contract to kill his wife. And you bought his story did you see my state in that house? You think I did that to myself, eh? Lastly, the cop?s relationship with Lukha. Whose money that is. How does that matter to you? All you needed is the dough, right? Well, you'll never trust me May no one ever come into my life, Lord If someone does come, may he never leave, Lord If tears are what's in store for me... may not someone make me laugh now Let no one make me laugh, Oh God! Away he went, and before he left... ...he snatched my happiness away In my eyes, so longing, he left nothing but grief Still I wait, though hope runs down my eyes Still I wait, though hope runs down my eyes May no one torment like this May no one ever come into my life, Lord One can't be forced to fall in love Love can never be traded I miss you, O cruel one I miss you, O cruel one May no one torment like this May no one ever come into my life, Lord If he does come, may he never leave, Lord If tears are what's in store for me... may not someone make me laugh now may not someone make me laugh now You were thirteen when I started Playing with you rocked you in my arms Laid you in bed Your body still makes me yearn. Mere touch gives me a shock Electric! It hurt me within when you hit me Look what you have done to me He stood by you only for your money Why did you do this? I smell the scum on you You bedded someone else... how can I accept you now? I am sorry. You'll Probably have to die No! - You've to die. Tell me, where are you going to hide? Where will you hide? Tell me, where are you going to hide? Where will you hide? There's no Place where you can save your skin. Tell me? Where will you hide? What value does money have? If there's anything that has a value... ...then it's my money. That's it. Walking tall and betrayal. I just have one answer. Sell it off. Sell it off. Sell it off. - Your eyes, sensuous. Your lips, rose-Petals If there's a Paradise here on earth, it is right here. It is... ...not here! Billa! Please take a seat Have a seat. Whose would you like to crack? - Lucky's whereabouts? No idea. I just know that there was another guy looking for him Who? You have only three hours... ...Whacko, to find out where he's eating. ...where he is scratching... ...and where he is screwing my brother's wife Else... you aren't worth a screw as it is... I'll make sure you don't eat and scratch anymore Hello! - Hello, Billa. It's Lucky speaking. Lucky. I'm coming with the money You're great, buddy.

Neither do I have anything to say about last night, nor do you But I'd still want to say something to you I know, it's not just the door that stands before you and me There's resentment too There's a chasm that can be bridged only when we trust each other Sam. Sam. I wonder how I will ever forget her? Neither is she coming back, nor will I ever forget her I have no Place to die, no excuse to live I have no Place to die, no excuse to live May no one cause so much of anguish to anyone, Lord May there be no one in anyone's life, Lord... Let it not go, if it comes once, Lord! I had to shed a lot of tears... I wish she hadn't given me reason to smile I wish she hadn't given me reason to smile Not to worry. The money's right where it was kept I wasn't worried about losing the money Forget it, Lucky all I've come to tell you is that I'm leaving If you had to go away, why did you come to tell me? Because you wanted me to stop you? Sit down I always thought I lived in a very different world a world where People don't take anyone's hand. They brush it off Where nobody embraces nobody. They slit throats They trust People... only to regret it later I tried to trust you but I was so... ...much in the habit of being deceived. I just couldn't But today I realize, our worlds are not so different after all We've had our share of Pain But neither got the opportunity to heal the wounds I got the opportunity last night. And I blew it So what do you want now? Another opportunity Move! Wait! - Move? What an entry, boss! That's enough! Anymore tricks from you, and I'll blow her skull! Why waste an official bullet? Whether he lives or dies, I don't give a damn! All right, I'll bump him off! C'mon! Don't think that the bullet hit the neck by mistake. The next time you raise your hand... ...l'll Pump all six in your chest. Okay? Billa's blood is still red! I've seen it after ages, you know? 50 miles around here, whenever a child cries in the night... his mother says, Go to sleep, my son. Or Gabbar will arrive Life's a journey, hero. Easy come, easy go It's time for you to go The money? It's with the girl. The festival never seems to end for you! You're up to tricks again! Where's the bag? - I've hidden it I love this habit of yours You always find a way to save your skin Ever gone Pillion-riding? C'mon, move it! Where's the bag? Where? Where is it? You think I'm Lukha...? I don't carry my brains in my Pants! Speak up! Where's the bag? Looks like you won't agree! Hi baby. Sorry baby. I have the money and the girl. So what are you guys fighting for? Enough of fisticuffs. How about the final take? Remember, hero? I once showed you the highway to life This is the railway of death death advances toward you at a speed of 500 kilometers The two of you will now walk on those railway tracks The one the train turns toward... ...has his role finished in the story If you survive, you get to keep the girl and I'll keep the money and if the cop survives, he'll take the money... and I'll keep the girl Now, ready? Walk. Lucky. No! Let me go! No! A DDR Release!
