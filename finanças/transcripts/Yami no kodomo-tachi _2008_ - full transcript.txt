You should smile. Keiko Keiko T)here's plenty more work for you to do Keep your spirits up or Chonpoe will make fun of you I don't care I saved her as a child We found her when we raided a condominium She was being abused by a Japanese It's your father Sure, it's hot Don't be so mad I'm too busy to come home, now I promise to call when I'm back in Tokyo I promise I'll head up to Chiangrai next week We know that the child is there I'm going up with a drug enforcement officer to figure out how to raid it That's for the best I'll join forces with you Please do, Geaw Certainly That boy and that girl Come, bet you want to get out How cute you are Let's go Bai, those Germans make the kids do it, and just watch Another one An organ transplant? A doctor will come and test their blood Make sure he tests only healthy ones If the blood type doesn't match, we'll have to find one that does And have a back-up ready just in case Have him check the kid with AIDS while he's here If it's hopeless, sell her in Chiangrai as usual at any price It's time to feed my birds I'll go up to the roof Senla Senla His thing's all black How many hormones did you use? Four, last year 3 was OK Four? Four kills a big man Police, police! Wait, wait, please don't! Listen, I'll buy him We can pay for the funeral his boy adopted by Germans next week They already paid deposit So what we're going to pay for him already You sure you can pay? I'll talk to my boss, but at least 7,000 U.S. Dollars You don't pay. we sell you off All right, we'll pay You take Visa? What, they let you out and you came back? A fight They grabbed my balls in a bar The cops erased your pictures so you're fired? My name card I'm a little short on bail I'm good at sneaking pictures And I've got a feel for journalism You're just really good at sneaking around You've got a point It's because... I'm a coward I meet someone's eye through the camera, I get the shakes That's why I take pictures when nobody's looking Hold on tight That's the Emergency entrance They won't use the main doors When the Kajikawas arrive for the operation, find a spot with a clear shot of that entrance and wait Also when the ambulance brings the donor I still can't believe it's real It's real, all right No one knew, that's all Guess I'll go find a camera position Hello? Hello? You're definitely strange What's strange? Since I met you, you've never looked me in the eye It's easier for me to talk that way My emotions can't live up to my feelings I want to look but I'm afraid of being looked at... When I was a kid there was this creepy kid called Koshiba Whenever my eyes met his... Spare me the tragic story Sorry You're not the only one whose emotions can't live up... Another Vodka You're having another drink? If you're smashed, I can't get you home I don't know where we are Where? We're just 20 centimeters from Tokyo, on a map It just ended Lek's seeing me home Oh, no See, I told you so Are you OK? Nanbu san, Nanbu san Behind you, behind Trying to fundraise isn't easy work I'll get off Thanks for seeing me home Good night, then We never would have made it this far without your support Lek! Why! How could this.. ! Somebody help! Somebody come! Lek, don't leave me! You 're foreigners here But our rules don't apply to you So you can have all the sex tours you want Seeing you makes me sick You disgusting Japanese In my mind, I've killed you guys over and over If you stop snooping around, I'll keep the killing in my head I understand. Please forgive me Oh, no, we've got to stop I refuse Why? Because he thinks I'm a disgusting Japanese Hello? It's me, Shimizu Kajikawa Mineko and her son just headed for Narita Airport Her husband may be trying to keep a low profile, but he went to work as usual I got it Another thing The week after next, Katsuhito's taking off work, from Tuesday through Thursday Probably to be there for the operation A brain-dead donor just shows up on schedule Makes no sense And Mineko flew with their Japanese doctors So, he's in on the scheme, too I'll let you know when I have his flight info Hello? What? I'm going home I'll get killed Going home without getting a single shot? I got a picture Of me drunk? No, of a kid, yesterday, a beggar... You didn't get that shot You stole it I said I had a feel for journalism, but... Keep it to yourself There they are Shoot! Driver, follow that van Wait, stop I'm supposed to get off here No time for that What is this... Straight ahead Start shooting OK? He's OK Shit The van got in the way It's OK It happened too fast I didn't believe you, but it's real, isn't it? They'll run tests on him for the next 10 days After that, they'll bring the child the donor, here If our information is correct Drop me off and then go to the airport Maybe I don't have what it takes to be a cameraman But you need your camera, right? You are staying on the story? I have to witness, the face of the child being sacrificed, entering that hospital Because I couldn't save it I'll watch and I'll write what I see Actually, someone else said that... Get in I get off here I decided I want to watch and photograph what I see Besides, it's only 20 centimeters from Tokyo Can I have some water? Can't you knock? Can I have a water? Sure, help yourself Is this your son? Yeah, that's right It's late, go to bed You're right What is it? Please let me go to Chiangrai There's plenty of work I can do there You mean, Aranya? Yes But what if you wind up like Lek... Geaw said at the funeral that was because there was a police informer We better do it on our own, then I understand I'm not going to let it end like this Oh, my shoulders are so tense They're tight as a knot Dr. Chawarit.. You removed my kidney before I'm feeling really bad I'd like you to examine me During regular check-up hours? That broker told me not to contact you after the operation, so I thought after hours would be best for both of us Because of my job, can you make some time next Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday? What? You're operating all 3 days? But I'm sure you'll be done fast, like you were with me, for my operation Tuesday or Wednesday after work Thursday's no good? You'll be in surgery all day? Heart surgery It's Thursday. I understand Heart surgery takes all day Where's Geaw when we need him ?

We had our hands full in Chiangrai without you, Geaw No, I was there I watched from the 2nd floor I'm no volunteer I can't stand all these NGO's popping up everywhere I run around smashing them Quit joking I'm not joking You guys went too far Our boss is pissed off The foreigners who handle the children like merchandise, destroying them body and soul are equally guilty Move! See ya OK, drive Geaw, stop! The children! Did you kill Lek! What's going on? Let go! ?e's not o?? of us! Chonpoe, are you OK? Can you run? I can Run, hurry! You need to go back to Japan I don't want to lie to myself Let go! Let go! Let go! You're all getting 15 years in prison Don't ridicule Thais Don't think you can escape the country We'll make sure you do hard time Thanks Sorry thanks Say Do you know who this is? It's his son He only had a daughter Senla Senla A bewildered flock of lamb unaware of where tomorrow will lead Wander in the dim street lights simply protecting themselves On the day the Flower mercilessly died they turned their faces away And left behind only those that felt the hurt Ghosts, filthy with greed reside in the dim-city lights While a grinning wolf is inviting you his way I who have been tamed cannot stand alone The river continues to flow and I can do nothing but watch it go It's too sad, just too sad The soul already wears a death mask The unforgettable shadow calls to say - don't die Let us feel once again, the simple joy of loving A streak of tears of emotion runs on the cheek People on trips without a purpose tired as one may possibly be Fall into their own traps If the innocent childhood dreams are to be proven wrong Let us know why there are two sides to this world Looking at the sun set as though stepping down a staircase It's easy to say that this is a merciless fate As the passion is communicated to the children yet to be born, The mother's profound words resinate in our hearts The shadow no longer existing tells me - don't cry The red tears of blood is the fire that burns this life Based on the novel "Children of the Dark" by Yan Sogiru Ending Theme Song Keisuke Kuwata The Strange Tales of Tokyo
