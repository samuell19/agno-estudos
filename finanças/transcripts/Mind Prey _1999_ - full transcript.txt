Come on guys. Let's go! Be ready in a sec. Gonna be late for your first day. I thought dad was taking us today? He is. I just don't want you to, what were you just watching? Nothing. Huh? So are you gonna pick us up after school today? Uh huh. (car horn beeps) Oh, there he is. Okay. Wait, give me a kiss. I love you. And I love you. And I'll pick you up after school. Daddy! Hey baby. Come here. Oh, oh my gosh. Oh, I missed you. Hmm. Yeah, I did. Hey Grace. Hi, (receding footsteps) All right, go. Been a good girl? (car door opens) Yeah. Yeah, yeah. (car door closes) Oh! (giggles) (thunder rumbles) (door shuts, locks) (tense music) (water surges) (thunder rumbles) What else? (heavy rain) What do cats eat for breakfast? I don't know. What do cats eat for breakfast? Mice crispies. (soft chuckle) Hey Grace, what are you mad at me? Yeah. Why? I'm mad at you. Why? You were there for an hour. Well I wanted to meet I get to sit in the front this time. Your new teacher. For an hour? He's very cute. (alarm blips) (door bursts open) (dramatic music) Mom! (bangs sides of van and car) No! Help us! No, go, go, go! (shouting) No, mom! No, no! No! (dramatic music) No! No! (door slams shut) (tires screech) Wait! Wait! (shouting) (banging) You're not getting out. And all the back doors without handles. Let me out! (banging) (dramatic music) Wait, wait! What are you doing? Who are you? Don't you remember. (gasping) (banging) (dramatic music) (truck bumps along) (shouting) (suspenseful music) Clear back, get out of this area here. (indistinct chatter) (heavy rain patters) What are you doing, Hendricks? Okay. Get back to me. He's lubricating. (thunder rumbles) (engine throbs) (door clunks) Hey. Good thing you wore "Obsession." Oh please. So what happened between you too, anyway? Tom! Shut up! Tell me. Andi Manette, 35 years old, psychiatrist in town, separated from her husband, abducted in a van, half an hour ago, her and two daughters. 9-year-old Genevieve, 12-year-old Grace. They attended school here. Witnesses? Parents, schoolchild. Greave took their statement. Greave? He got here first. (scoffs) Got some more blood down here. Whoever took 'em, took 'em hard. All right, let's get the sample over to the lab. See if we can get a blood type. You two, go door to door. See if any neighbors saw anything suspicious. What, you think it's a money job? It makes sense. If you're looking for ransom you don't need to take all three and you damn sure don't do it in broad daylight. Well, maybe the guy's a nut? You know, she's a shrink he's patient? What you got, Greaves? Got a guy over here, David Gerdler and a little girl, nine years old. Mercedes Barnett, both confirmed a blue van with a nose on it. You know, one of them engine overs? Yeah, yeah. I know what's talking about. All right. Suspect. A white male, mid-20s, (soft chuckle) muscular, long blonde hair, he's wearing jeans and a gray t-shirt with a logo on it. It's says Cen Con or something. Anyway, he scoots off with the mom and daughters all struggling (case thumps down) and bloody in the van. That could be anybody's blood. Hey, did you say Cen Con? Yeah. That's what she said. C-E-N C-O-N. Yeah, I know. It's a gamers convention. They launched my first game a couple of years ago. What was that? A ring? What? (rain hammers down) In your pocket? Oh. Yeah, I guess. You guess. Can I see it? What for? So I can steal the damned stone. What do you think? (indistinct radio chatter) Here. Ho-ho! Nice! That's not bad for a cubic zirconium. Item 122, Home Shopping Network. I was gonna get one too. (chuckles) (tense music) Baggy! Give me that. Nice family. (thunder rumbles) Yeah. (indistinct speech) (distant siren blares) I keep telling you those things are gonna kill us. Tell me you found them, all right? If I did, would I be up here ruining your dinner plans? Gosh. That's okay. I mean, you're gonna nail this perp right? Yeah. We're gonna nail the perp. Yeah. Honey, tell you what? I'll meet you at home, okay? Give me a kiss. (lips smack) (door opens) Now you're aware the victim's father is Tower Manette? Yep. And we're talking about an only child by his first wife. Married to his second wife, Helen Manette. Yeah, I got it right here. That's right. Now, what about Andi Manette's husband, George Dunn? It's strange. We know he wasn't in the van, but he's got some questions to answer. Well, he's gonna have to wait 'cause I promised Manette you'd meet with him immediately. Why don't you go ahead and meet him. I've gotta go- It'll take a minute. Come on. Just meet with this guy and make nice. Who knows? He might be able to help us? Do it for me, all right? (sighs) You know your husband said "perp." Yeah, I know, but I love him. I wanted us to meet privately first without the women present. I understand. First of all, is there anything I can do? A reward, an appeal? Well, we're waiting to see if there's any type of ransom demand first. Can you think of anyone who might wanna get at you or Mrs. Manette? I've got more enemies than most men. It's gotta be a dozen in this state who blame me for destroying their careers. Well, right now in the case doesn't even seem logical, let alone political. So is it possible we're dealing with someone who's insane? Frankly, that is the thing that scares me the most. (clock chimes) You see, Andi treated the worst of the worst. Sex criminals, psychopaths. We're getting a search warrant to go through her files. Lydia Wolf, the young woman with my wife is Andi's partner. I'm sure she'll help in whatever way is necessary. What about your daughter's husband? What about him? He's scum! Tower. Mrs. Manette. We were discussing George Dunn. What about him? He's a snake. Tower, relax. (coughs) Everything's gonna be fine. My husband has had some health problems recently. Well, we'll keep you apprised. That's fine. That's fine. But I want my daughter and my grandchildren back. I expect that you will do whatever it takes? I trust you to understand that, Chief Davenport? (horn blares) Do whatever it takes. What am I, a gun for hire now? Well, you kind of put yourself in that position didn't you? I mean, you know your reputation. I don't want anything to do with these people or this case. Give it to somebody else. I don't want- No, I need you on this one. I don't think Andi Manette or kids stand a chance otherwise. All right, so? What happens if I do whatever it takes? You all right with that? (car purrs along) Lucas, if it gets ugly, I don't wanna know about it. I'm like two years away from a gold watch. So just find these people and make this go away. (wiper blades swish) (lighter clicks) You know, I'd like to live to see retirement myself. You gonna lose the cigarette? Thank you. (case rattles, bangs) (uneasy music) There's gotta be a way outta here. Where are we? I don't know. Seemed like we were in that van for an hour. Who is he? God, it must have been 10 years ago. I was doing my residency. I was supposed to evaluate him. (water drips) (music threatens more) He had done some, bad things. John. Mail, John Mail. But why is he doing this? I don't know, baby. Maybe he's just trying to scare mama? 'Cause I had him sent away. (knocking sound) What's he gonna do, mommy? Come on, sweetie. (door bangs open) (ominous music) Get out here. All right, John. Come on, girls. Not them! Just you. All right. I'll be right back. John is not gonna hurt me. (hand slaps) Ahh! No. Get back! (door slams, locks) No! Ah! I've been listenin' to the radio. They have no idea where you are or who took you? Even got Davenport looking for you. John. You don't wanna hurt me. I took care of you. Locking me up, is that haw you took care of me? Let's see it. What? You know what I'm talking about. No, I, I don't- (grunts) (blow lands) (body hits floor) Now, I'm gonna take Mommy! Care of you. Mommy, no! No! No! No, oh! No, ugh! Stop! No! No! (tense music) Hey, Chuck. What do you got? Let me get back at you. Hello Lucas. Your man. He's down by the water and he doesn't wanna leave. (insects chirp) All right. Hey how's Holly? Good. Good. (chimes tinkle) (insects chirp) (water babbles) (dog barks) Mr. Dunn. You must be Davenport? Did you find them? Not yet. Listen. I, I need to ask you a few questions. Yeah. You've been separated from your wife for about a year, right? Yeah. About that. When was the last time you saw her? This morning? I, I, I took my daughters to school and I called her from the car. How'd you describe your relationship? I'm a suspect, aren't I? You want a lawyer? No. Look what, what do you wanna know? You know, I made a mistake. I did a stupid thing. I cheated on my wife once. I've been trying to make it up with Andi, but, you know, things haven't been going easy. I don't know if you believe this or not, but I love my wife and my kids and I do anything to get them back. (sighs) Or kill them for money if you couldn't, huh? Hmm? You know, for the record, I don't need the money. That's the difference between me and the rest of her family. They don't look that bad off to me. Yeah. Well, it's all part of the show. The fact is Manette's broke, except for a trust fund he set up for my wife and my daughters. No insurance? Yeah, on me, and my daughters are the beneficiaries. Are you satisfied yet? I'll let you know when I'm satisfied, all right? Davenport, I busted my hump to get all this. Andi and I sacrificed everything to make sure this home was comfortable and safe for those kids. And I screwed it up. It's the only thing I ever wanted and I screwed it up. I could never hurt those kids. So everybody has a motive except for you, right? That bothers you. Doesn't it. You wanna know what bothers me? Hmm? This. (bag crackles) (slow, soft music) You gonna find them, aren't cha? (insects chirp) (music gets louder) Yeah. No problem. (cars sweep past) (soft clunk) (soft music) (jumps) Damn! (chuckles) You got me. Hi. Hey. Promises, promises. Come here. Mmm. Mmm. Whoa, hold this. Stop. Stop! (laughing) Stop. Come back, come back. No, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I'm serious. Okay. Okay. Okay, I promise. I promise. (laughs) Stop. Stop. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey, hold on. (chuckles) Lucas. What's the matter? Stop laughing. (laughs) All right. I, I've been thinking about some things. Oh, really? (soft chuckle) Come on, I'm being serious. Like what sort of things? (gentle music) (phone rings) (sighs) I have two surgeries tomorrow morning. Yeah, um... So. I know. Just gimme a minute. Okay? (phone rings) (beeps) Yeah? I'm gonna have to kill them, Davenport. Who is this? (tense music) Who do you think? I don't know. Could be the garbage man for all I know. Andi Manette's got a birthmark like a rocket on her lower back. That sound like garbage to you? You wanna tell me why? You tell me why! Look, don't make this a game, all right? But you're so good at games. Yeah. And I'll beat you. No, you won't. (phone clicks) (dial tone) (beeps) (tense music) (phone clatters on desk) What are you waiting for? Time is running out! Look, cops can't work together and sleep together, okay? It just gets too intense! What's wrong with intense? (machinery hums) (doors clunk) Did you ask her? I got my tux. (doors close) Something bad happened? He called me last night. What did he say? He wants to turn this into a game. (phones ring) Hi Eleanor. I'm deputy chief Davenport. These are detectives Black and Vega. We have a search warrant for Dr. Manette's office. I'll get Dr. Wolf. No how about this? How about you show me the office first, then you can get whomever you wish. (indistinct chatter) (phones ring) (receding footsteps) Where are the files? They're over here. (distant siren) Thank you. There's a-gonna be some noise! (door opens) What are you doing? I've got a subpoena, a search warrant and a release from next of kin. If you're referring to that lying sack of- I'm referring to George Dunn. Andi Manettes husband and father of her two children. All right. Let's just skim everything. Get names and numbers, look especially for references to violence. Hey, you can't do that. Ah-ah-ah-ah! Don't do that. You know, you'll set us back years with these patients. Don't tell 'em. I have to tell them, I'm responsible for them. Wrong. I'm responsible. And you'll inform no one without approval from me. This is ludicrous. Is it true you'll get half a million dollars in insurance if Andi Manette dies? (distant horn blows) (keyboard clacks) Who told you that? Did George Dunn tell you that? You haven't answered my question? I'm calling my attorney. (scoffs) Boy. You are so smooth. Yeah well, I was born with that talent. Are you okay? (tense music) (water drips) What did he do to you mommy? I-I'm all right. I'm okay. (knocking) Oh God. Oh God. (footsteps) (door opens) You, out. (tense music) Oh, oh no. No, no. Oh, please. Shut up! Don't take her John, please. Don't don't, no, please, John. Please, I beg you. My baby. Please, please don't do this. Please, John, I beg you. I won't let, she won't get in the way. I, I promise you. She won't get in the way. I'll- Shh! Thank you. (screams) (thuds on floor) Oh! No, please! (overlapping shouts) Wait! No! (cocks pistol) Huh? I'm dropping her off at the mall, all right? I wanna stay here. Shut up! She wants to go to the mall. Please. No! Can I just button her coat? Please. Please? No. (tense music) I wanna stay here! It'll be okay. Just be a good girl, he'll take you to the mall. And you ask for a policeman and you tell them who you are! And, and... (door closes) Mommy! Mom! No. No! No, no! (screams) (sobs) (cars whoosh past) Hey, Hey! (upbeat music) (door closes) Hey Lucas, this one's gonna make ya a million bucks, man! What's the story with this pendulum phase? I keep on getting squashed. (shouts from game) It's a timing mechanism. Take two steps back before you make the spring, you'll land safely. After that you're on your own. Hey, listen, come on. I need to talk to you. (door opens) No problem. Hey, Ice, watch the cash, huh? Yeah. (upbeat music plays in store) Saw your mug in the news. That shrink who got kidnapped. (scoffs) Yeah. Listen, that's why I'm here. I think the guy's a gamer? Gamer? Yeah. He called me last night, said he knew I was good at games. Plus someone saw wearing a Cen Con shirt when he made the grab. Cen Con? Mm-hmm. Mid-20s, wiry build. Hey! Stop that, Blond hair by- What are you doing? (banging) Paloma, get out here! Hang on. (hissing) The hell is going on? He's crazy. This guy asked to borrow my lighter and he set this shirt on fire. (tense music) Cen Con! Where is he? He just left. (dramatic music) Hey! Oh! (indistinct shouts) (traffic whooshes past) (people chatter) Hey Sloan, do me a favor. Take my friend Ice here and have her look at the composite of the Manette kidnapper, right? Thanks. Let's go. Hey. We got a problem. Yeah, I got some news too. Andi Manette's kidnapper described a birth mark. And? Only said it was on her lower back. George Dunn confirmed it. So, what do you have? Darrell Eldis, senior VP at Jerrell International. Molests little boys in the scout troop he supervises. Andi Manette's treating child molesters? She and her partner, both. And from what we've seen of the files, none have been reported to us. We know the names of the little boys? No, but I can get the guys from sex on it. Uh-huh. By the time all the legal matters are settled Andi Manette and her daughters are dead. What do you want me to do? Just keep looking. Find me a suspect. (indistinct chatter) Hey Cheryl. Listen, I... Thanks. (people chatter) What, you expect me to just ignore this? Not ignore it. Just, just gimme a couple of days. All these guys out touching little boys. He's supposedly in recovery. Oh, Lucas! Look, Marie, I don't like this anymore than you do! Okay. Let's say we arrest this guy. By sunset we're knee deep in lawsuits. Marie, I'll personally take down this guy. I'm just asking you for a shot at the kidnapper first. Well make it fast. I brief the Manette family this morning. We could use some results. (door opens) (door clunks shut) Lucas. What d'you think? (phone rings) Hmm. It could be him. It could be Elvis. All right, get it out to the uniforms. Also gimme a guest list of the Cen Con convention. Yo Lucas, you got a call here from a Dr. Roderick from Iberia. Start a trace! (tense music) Kidnappers, duh? (handset clatters) 8th century Visigoth king in Spain, conquered by the Moors of 711 AD. I didn't think you'd remember that. Opposing sides of my first game. Yeah, I remember. (slams down phone) Lucas, Lucas! What the hell you doing? All right, stay on your toes. He's not gonna stay on the line long. (tense music) (phone rings) How does it feel? What'd you hang up on me for? Because I'm busy. Well, you better get unbusy or the other two are gonna end up like the runt. Hello? Got time for me now? What'd you do to Genevieve? Go eat at Nethinim's Davenport. You'll get your answer there. Come again? Sorry. One chance per customer. And you were lucky with that Cen Con shirt. (phone clicks) (dial tone) (phone clatters) (tense music) Not enough time, Lucas. How come we still don't have caller ID? How did he know we IDed the shirt? What's a Nethinim? It's in the Bible. Nehemiah. Yeah, I knew that. Shaw, get me a Bible. Somebody get him a Bible. C'mon guys, a Bible. Let's go, let's go! Lucas, Lucas! (indistinct chatter) "Moreover, the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out." (tense music) You can see those water towers from the river and the water gate might be one of those dams. All right, call the precincts. Have 'em check out those towers. Check for what? A 9-year old girl. All right guys. Come on, come on, let's go. Let's go, pick up. C'mon, move! (ominous music) (water drips) Mom. (whispers) What are we gonna do? We have to fight him. We have to find something that we can fight him with. We have to find something that we can hurt him with, because... Now I have to hurt him with something. Gotta find something. Oh, Gracie, come here! Here's a nail. Something we can- (clunking overhead) Go back! (tense music) (door opens) (trays slide on floor) Where is my daughter? I dropped her off at the mall. I don't believe you, I don't believe you. Told her to call the cops and ask for Davenport. You've said that name before. Davenport. Oh yeah. He's my buddy, thinks he's a gamer. I got him beat. Are you afraid of him? (tense music) I'm not afraid of anyone. (water drips) (tense music) (door slams, locks) This is it. Get this nail off here. Must have been 2,000 gamers at that Cen Con convention. Yeah, I know. Just do the best you can, okay? What about chat rooms? I could search the net for him? Was it Rodney? No. Roderick. Is that his real name? King Roderick is one of the names I used in my first game. That's all we have to go on, so. I'll hit some bulletin boards. See if I get any nibbles. (phone rings) Hey, Ice. Be careful, all right? I can handle 'em. Yeah. Lucas, listen, they got something downtown. An oil drum under one of the water towers. It's got your name on it. What? Yeah. "Lucas" is spray painted right on the side. What's in the barrel? We're not sure. Robot did not think a bomb, but it's full and it's heavy. Gonna pull the lid from a distance, see what happens. (robot whirs) It's not explosives, but stay clear till the lid's off. Okay, chief. We're ready. (machinery whines) All clear. (tense music) Oh, I don't do this. It's not a little girl. (barrel clangs) (water gushes) Some sense of humor. (phone rings) Yeah? Damn, you're fast Lucas. Can I call you Lucas? Yeah, sure. What can I call you? (tense music) You can't. Then how are we supposed to talk, huh? I mean, you can see me, right? You see I'm trying to work with you here, right? Huh? Come on. Where's the challenge, huh? I mean, you're just acting like somebody who's sick. Sick. Think I'm sick? I mean, you know, maybe I can help get you fixed. Hey man, I've been fixed! The best and the brightest strapped me to a table and fixed me real good. So don't tell me how you're gonna fix things! (hangs up phone) (dial tone) (sighs) (phone beeps) (police radio chatter) (footsteps on game) So what's got your far in a bunch? (coughs) (fighting sounds) (shouting) Mail! (taps keyboard) You are trying my patience. The doll in the barrel, the phone calls to Davenport. I told you I wanted this finished. (tense music) (keyboard taps) Then get ready. You don't have much longer. Bite me. (ominous music) (door opens) (sighs) (water splooshes) (dishes clatter) It's been 48 hours and I'm still no closer to solving this thing. (scoffs) Do you think they're still alive? (car horn beeps) There's more to this case, isn't there? Andi Manette's treating child abusers. Vega and Black found three cases so far. Oh my God. What'd you do? Nothing yet. I just went through the files. You did nothing? I don't understand. It's privileged information. Look, I handle this thing the wrong way, a bunch of perverts get a free ride, not to mention I scare off this kidnapper. I'm sorry. I just... I thought that there were some things that were more important than solving a case. Don't you think I know that, Weather? Well, you don't act like it. Every time you get on a case, you just... You just get further away from me. What are you talking about? Let me ask you a question. If you and I were to have children, okay? Hypothetically. 'Cause I don't want you to freak out. But if you and I were to have children, would you jeopardize them in order to solve a case? I'm trying to stop some crazy guy from killing a woman and her kids. That's my job. And I do whatever I have to do to do that job. I just wish that you had this kind of commitment in other areas of your life. I'm gonna finish everything up in the morning. (receding footsteps) (ominous music) (taps on keyboard) (indistinct speech) You getting anything? Yeah. Some kid into sex and aggression. Think he scared her. Listen, substantial maladjustment, severely abused, channels rages through sex, extremely violent and severely claustrophobic? Men are so screwed up. I can tell you about men. You know that young DA, Bucky? Yeah. I had this crush on him, you know? And I didn't know, he had a crush on me, so, we got together and we went out to dinner one night, took me to The Garlic House. I hate garlic. And so I just had a salad, but oh God, my heart was. And I walked him home and I was hoping we could stop at a convenience store for breath mints. I didn't find one. And we were gonna say goodnight. And he was gonna kiss me. And his breath was, oh! I said, you know, "Not on my first date, you know?" I said, "I'll call you," and... He never called. He never called. Oh, he'll call! No, I don't want him to call me. I found out he's married! Oh, I'm sorry. That dog! Listen, I wanna run a few of these downtown. Yeah. Especially that last one. That sex and aggression. John Mail. Yeah. Okay. Listen, don't tell nobody. I won't. I'm sorry. Bye. Keep thinking you're right around the corner but so far you're not even close. Maybe I'm closer than you think. Maybe you don't have a clue. Oops. Gotta go. (tape clicks off) And that's all she wrote. What's the radio station playing in the background? KXRT. Alternative rock. (chuckles) What you got, Black? A couple of psychos. One I like a lot. All right, tell me. John Mail, 16 years old, started out torturing neighborhood pets. Blinding them, maiming them. Moves on to girls at 14. Arrests for indecent assault, molestation, attempted rape. And he's really claustrophobic. Andi saw him 10 years ago so that puts him around- 26? 26, yeah. Yeah, well run him down. Okay. Dunn said he called Andi in the car, right? Yeah. So? Was that on a car phone or portable? You got anything? Portable. Registered George Dunn. (game music plays) (characters shout, fight) And now we're ready to draw one more phone number and give it 10 rings in our 93 Squeeze- Got it, Davenport. Let's see here, George Dunn. I'm gonna get you. (phone rings on radio) Come on Georgie. (phone rings) You're gonna need this, man. Please be home. Let's dial him up. (indistinct chatter) KXRT. 93 squeeze. Come on. That's four. (helicopter rotor beats) (tense music) Okay George Dunn, that's six. Four more rings and we gotta move on. Nah, he's not gonna bite. Hello. That's him. Go, go 160 southeast. (blades throb) Sloan, you got that? We're on our way on 195. (sirens wail) He's gotta be in foreign country. (cars roar away) (sirens blare) All right. George Dunn! This is Milo Sweet of KXRT where we squeeze and you suck it up for $100,000. (dramatic music) Looks like he's between us. (sirens wail) (blades throbbing) We squeeze a whole song into five seconds and you get 10 and tell us what it is, okay, George? Here it comes. How far are we? Closing fast. You got 10 seconds, George. 50 degrees south. Coming up, Lucas. Six miles east of Stillwater. Come on. Come on, come on! All right George. We need your answer. That was "Travesty Lane" by the Sea Monkeys. Nice try, Davenport. Damn! We almost had him, Lucas. (siren wails) (helicopter throbs) Lucas. It's Black. Yeah? (solemn music) Just so you know that sex and aggression suspect, John Mail? He's dead. Committed suicide six months ago. (helicopter throbs away) (heavy breathing) (water drips) What did you, what did you put in the food, John? Let's see. What did you give me? What did I give you? Ethylicine. How does it feel to be on the other end of the needle? Oh God! Grace. Grace! Kinda scary isn't it, when someone else has total control? I never hurt you, John. Oh, yes you did. God, please, John. I was trying to help you. Yeah. Well, that's what I wanted to believe. Then I started getting those messages. What, what messages? Email. I start getting flashes from someone. Wants to know if I remember Dr. Manette? (tense music) "The one who put you away. You remember Dr. Manette? She brags about you all the time. How she locked you up. How she made you scream." No! Who? That's my little secret. (tense music) Remember how we used to share all our secrets? You'd sit there in your doctor's chair. Tight dress. Legs crossed. But now you have all the power, John. Uh-huh. Except, he doesn't know what you're doing. He doesn't know if I'm dead or alive. Who's he? Davenport. So what? So, if I made a phone call, and if Davenport is the gamer you say he is, knowing I'm alive will make his job lot harder. It'll give you power over him, John.

Her Aunt Lisa, that's Lisa Farmer. She's been dead for 10 years. Tell me more. She was my first wife's sister. She had a big place in the country. A lot of horses. It's possible she's being held on a farm. Helicopter tracked his cell signal to Dakota County. The part about Genevieve. She's dead, isn't she? (birds tweeting) (clock ticks) We're not sure. You've got real estate in Dakota County, don't you? So what? Huh? Are you accusing me of setting this up, huh? Huh?! I, I, I'm gonna put up a reward. $100,000. I'm gonna make an announcement right now. (coughs) Tower, you've got to lie down. You. Find this bastard. (suspenseful music) I, I presume you have checked his alibi? George's I mean? I mean, not that he couldn't have hired an accomplice. You think he could have done this to his own kids? No, no, no. No! I guess I wouldn't put it past him. I don't know! For that matter, I wouldn't put it past Lydia Wolf. If Andi were to die, Lydia, wouldn't just get the insurance. I mean, she, she'd actually get the entire practice! That Helen Manette was a piece of work, wasn't she? Yeah. It's probably 'cause Lydia Wolf's doing Tower Manette. How d'you know? The way she touches him. She's always touching him. Now Manette family members have declined our request for statements so far. Local authorities though, headed by deputy chief Lucas Davenport, ensure the safe return of Andi Manette and her two daughters, Grace and Genevieve. To that end authorities have released this police sketch Mail. And they're asking anyone with knowledge of this individual's whereabouts Mail. To contact them immediately. To date the investigation of this tragic crime has yielded few clues. Mail. Andi Manette is one of the city's leading psychiatrists and her father, Tower Manette, one of the most influential power brokers. Sources tell us that he's met privately with deputy chief Davenport (taps on keyboard) to discuss the department's lack of leads. (tense music) Finish them off! (taps on keyboard) You're forgetting who put all this together. (types violently) Andi sent a message on that tape that you let her make. Her Aunt Lisa is dead. Davenport is searching Dakota County. You don't have much time. (tense music) I just keep digging, we'll get it out. How are you feeling, Grace? I dunno. I think the drugs have worn off. We're gonna get out here I promise you, Grace We are gonna get out of here. (banging) (dramatic music) Remember, no eye contact, head down. (door bangs open) You tricked me! No, John, I- Come here! No, no, ow, no! Run! Ow! (body thumps) (door clunks) (shouts) (top rips) No, John! No! You got six more perfect files on your desk. But none of 'em as good as the sex and aggression, right? John Mail. He jumped off the Lake Street bridge the day after he got released from the mental ward over at St. Peters. (people chattering) Let me ask you a question. How was his body IDed? The ME ran the dental, said his body was in the river about a week when they finally_ Lucas! Okay. I got him. Tell me. Okay. There was a gamer at a D and D party who remembers meeting a guy named Roderick and some girl. He thinks that the girl was Roderick's girlfriend or something. But he said they were both really weird. Weird how? Well, he kept talking about what a genius he was. And she kept bragging about how many mental institutes she'd been in. Okay, Ice, listen. Did you get her name? Yeah. Gloria Crosby. What about an address? Wow. Okay, thanks. Listen. You stay here with Detective Black, okay? Vega. Come on! Wait a second. I wanna come! (busy chatter) (knocks on door) Who is it? Lucas Davenport. Minnesota PD. (children playing) Whaddya want? I wanna know if you've ever played Dungeons and Dragons with this guy? (dog barks) I don't remember. Come on now, please, take another look. Maybe you met him at school at another party somewhere? (dog clicks) Hm? What'd he do? (scoffs) The kidnapping? I saw this on the news. You're the cop. Right. Listen. I know you, you're a gamer. Just help me out. A name, address, anything, please. I don't know. I, I put it on the net when I have these games and people just show up. So you're telling me you don't even know this guy, huh? He might have come once. But I don't remember. Huh. Elsium. Prozac. They are prescription. I've got emotional problems. (pills rattle) (banging) Let me tell you something. Come here. I, um, I find out that you know this guy and you're not telling me, you're gonna have more than emotional problems. Hmm? Here. Call me when the fog clears. (door opens) (door closes) (clicks lock) John, baby. (soft chuckle) You did it. You really did it. (insects chirp) (slow footsteps) Hey John. Hey! (cocks pistol) How did you find me? You told me about this place when we were in St. Peter's, remember? Oh. Yeah. Right. Right. (uncocks pistol) You got 'em here, don't you? That whore bitch doctor and her kids. You got 'em don't you? (sinister music) What's the matter, you don't trust me? You wouldn't even be here if I hadn't helped pull that little switcharoo. It's just. Not a good time. Come on, John baby. I wanna see her. I wanna see you hurt her. (chuckles) All right. (soft laugh) (feet bang) How'd you know, it was me? That cop came to my place. Davenport. Don't worry, I threw him off the trail. (insects chirp) (catch springs back) (trapdoor clatters) It's down there. Can I do the kids? If you want. (receding footsteps) (sinister music) (stairs creak) He's got a problem with women. He's got a thing for games. The point is let's make him think we've got an entire operation back here. Set up just for him. I wanna see if I can get him to play my game now. We can take his composite, run it through a program which would show like a thousand variations of his face. Good, good. Vega, I want you on this terminal pulling up 3-D lift off showing how we're tracking his cell phone from the helicopter, right? Don't worry. I'll show you how to do it. Ice. You get to be the bait. Ooh, I like that. So will he. You'll be a new challenge so, hopefully he'll bite. Don't worry. He'll be here. (phone rings) Palomas. Channel 6. They'll be here in an hour for a live remote. All right. Show time. (cameras click, whir) The fact is between chief Davenport's counter gaming expertise and the state of the art technology we've got here, we figured it'll be a matter of hours. Despite how clever this guy thinks he is, he's never seen programs like these before. (scoffs) (overlapping shouts) How will the computer technology help determine identity and location? Basically, he's been reduced to a binary set in a probability curve. (tense music) And can you tell us if he's in the Metro area? I, I don't wanna get specific right now, but I can tell you we're very close to locating him, and Don't play games, Davenport. Don't play games. (sinister music) (switch clicks) I'm up, I'm up. I'm sorry. That's okay. I was waiting for you. (chuckles) Yeah. Right? How are you doing? I'm all right. Besides the fact that I keep feeling like I'm running on a treadmill. (scoffs) Maybe you just need to change the way you're doing things? Old dog, new tricks, baby. You know how that goes. Yeah. Hey, how was your day? It's 1:30 in the morning, baby. I don't know how we got into this routine. I'm gonna brief you on my day. You're gonna pretend to listen, and then we're gonna pretend everything's cool. Look, Weather, I just got a lot of stuff going on. Don't give me that "It's the job," speech. I mean, I don't, I don't wanna be a nag. I just wanna know that you wanna make some progress. You don't think I want the same thing you do? (gentle music) You know, I... I see things in people. I... I see things in people that you don't. That doesn't mean I'm not trying, I'm... I'm right here. You gotta trust that. Tired you are? I know. Shh. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon, lay down. Come to bed. (scoffs) (groans) I wish I could. I gotta take a shower. Go back to the station. There's something I'm not seeing. Okay. (gentle music) I'm doing the best I can. I know. (phone rings) You too, huh? (siren wails) Hey. So, did you ask her yet? (laughing) No, I haven't. Oh. Oh, yeah. You know? Problems? You know what's funny is the only time I seem to be comfortable is when I'm in here at 3:00 AM. (chuckles) I miss your laugh. Give yourself a chance, Lucas. You deserve to be happy. Maybe when this is over. It's getting closer to over. Well, it was until this John Mail dropped out. Assault, rape, severe claustrophobia. Yeah. He had it all. What? The sole witness to John Mail's suicide was a female. Gloria Crosby. (tense music) The woman we questioned? Call Black. Get him out of bed. Have him check St. Peter's, get everything he can on Crosby and Mail. And then have to check the John Mail suicide file and meet us over at Gloria Crosby's. (indistinct) (tense music) Gloria? (knocks on door) (door bursts open) Gloria! (ominous music) (dramatic sting) Damn. (footsteps) No! Oh! Oh! Okay. (soft music) Gloria Crosby, I presume? Medical examiner pulled these photos of the autopsy. He got all tangled up in a bunch of wires and stuff. Body decomposed beyond recognition. Or someone anchored him to the bottom of the river. What about St. Peters? Chief psychiatrist St. Peters said he knew Mail and Crosby. Said they were friends. Tell me one of 'em worked in the infirmary. Crosby. How d'you know? Because they had to have access to switch the dental records. Gloria Crosby helped Mail fake his death. What about the body in the river? That was somebody else. John Mail's alive. (tense music) He's gonna kill us soon, isn't he? I hate this place. Ouch. (slaps floor) What is it? Help me. (fabric tears) (grunts) A spring? A tool. To take out the nail. (intense music) (taps keyboard) (distant traffic passes) (computer beeps rapidly) (taps keyboard) (suspenseful music) (taps keyboard) Oh, my God! He's made contact twice. Well, you think he's coming? Yeah. We need to set up road blocks in and around Stillwater. I wanna check every van coming and going. I'll also need every cop you can spare to flood the area around Paloma's (phone rings) What if he doesn't take the bait? Well, then I'll do it the old-fashioned way. You start roasting suspects and we're both gonna be unemployed. Unless you're out of the office when it happens, I acted on my own authority. You won't know about it until it's over. You willing to sacrifice your career for this, Lucas? If I have to. (door slams) (cats wail) (tense music) (thunder rumbles) Vega, you got anything? All's clear in the south alley. (sighs) I don't know, if it were me, I wouldn't even come near this place. Yeah, but you're not a psychopath are you? Don't worry. He'll be here. I got someone coming in. What are you talking about? I'm right here. He's in the alley, Lucas. I can't see his face, but he's looking at looking at Paloma's. Looking at Paloma's. I got him. (tense music) What d'ya wanna do, Lucas? All right, everybody on your toes. Be ready to flood the area? Get ready, Sloan. He's coming towards you. (dramatic music) (footsteps) (door opens) Police! Put it down! Freeze! Put it down! (gun roars) (metal clangs) Ow, my leg! Who are you? Rick Bryce! Check him. What are you doing here? Guy said I could score some blow if I gave this to a guy named Davenport. (gun cocks) Don't move! Don't be stupid! Greave, check the area. No, no, something's not right. Lucas. Vega! (dramatic music) Greave, he's here! Vega! Watch him. Watch him! Vega! (dramatic music) (loud bang) (ladder clatters) Cheryl? God, no. Cheryl? (dramatic music) (running footsteps) (machinery whirs) (footsteps clatter) (running footsteps) (dramatic music) (multiple gunshots) (bullet ricochets) (bars rattle) (shouts) (panting) (indistinct radio) (helicopter passes over) I'm sorry, man. Chief, we got a woman in a house down the alley, beaten pretty bad. Purse missing, car missing. He made it out. (phone rings) (tense music) Mail. I beat you Lucas. I sprung your trap when I took out your little bitch cop girlfriend as well. Hey. You know my name? Yeah. I know everything. I know about Gloria Crosby and your accomplice. You know about her? Her. Yeah, her. But she doesn't matter. 'Cause this is still between you and me. No, no! It's not! (tense music) Give me back Andi and the kids. I'll see you in hell, Davenport. (phone bangs, clatters) (dramatic sting) Greave, you and Black go get Lydia Wolf. Sloan, you get Helen Manette. What d'you mean, get? I mean, get 'em outta bed! No dressing, no lawyers, nothing. He's closing down the game. He's gonna kill Manette and the kids. You're gonna shake 'em down? He said his accomplice was a her. You don't know which one. But I'm gonna find out. Lucas, if you do this, you go down. Then we all go down. Black. Give me your phone. I'm sorry. We're gonna get him, all right? Yeah. (phone beeps) Marie, it's Lucas. Tell me what I heard about Vega isn't true? Yeah, she's gone. Oh, God Lucas. Listen, you need to be outta touch for a few hours. You know they'll take your badge? If I don't do it my way, I don't want it. Just make sure I have a chopper standing by. It's coming out. (tense music) (footsteps overhead) Shh. Where is he? I dunno. I just need a little more time, but he's coming. I can feel it. I know he's coming. (dramatic sting) This time he is gonna feel it. (car roars past) (dramatic music) (indistinct radio chatter) (car revs away) (dramatic music) (door bangs open) Listen, you can't do this. (door bangs) Get me my lawyer. You get a lawyer when I say you get a lawyer. Your psycho patient kill my partner! My best friend! I don't know what you're talking about! Oh, yeah? Now what if I can prove you're doing Tower Manette, does that help jog your memory, doctor? I want my husband! (punches violently) Your husband doesn't want you! You know what he wants? He wants his daughter and his granddaughters. When he finds out that you and your little friend were thinkin' about carving 'em up and serving 'em like dog food, you know what's gonna happen to you? You're gonna to end up with nothing! So come on, come clean. Talk to me. Sloan, get something. (door opens) (door bangs) Excuse me! You said whatever it takes. Not like this. We're getting a court order. Well, when it's in your hand then you talk to me. You are finished, Davenport! I'll handle this, Tower. We're back in half an hour. We'll deal with you then. Cool. Get 'em outta here. (door bangs) You're outta your mind! You can't do this. You're violating my rights. Look at me. You think I care about what you think? Right now, the only thing I care about is John Mail. I don't know him. I think you do and I think you better start telling me where he is right now! I didn't do anything! Oh, no? Argh! You're an angel, huh? All right, Angel. What happens when I go next door? And I tell Helen Manette you're doing her husband? Huh? Don't you think she's gonna wanna serve you up? Don't you think she's gonna want you to go down for this? Huh? 'Cause that's what I'm gonna do. Unless you give me something different and you give it to me right now. Ugh! Okay. We do it your way. You stay here. You stay shackled. (door opens) Oh, you can't do this. Watch me! Give me my lawyer! (doors bang) Please! Take me home. All right. What'd you get, Sloan? I'm working on it. You're working on it? What, are you deaf? I told you what to do! (punch lands) Come on! My God! Come on! That's too far. Lucas. Yeah. You're pathetic. (door bangs) Look lady. I'm outta patience. I got nothing left to lose. So where's John Mail? Where is he? No listen. You don't understand. I- Now, no, now! Tell me now! (screams) Please don't hurt me! Where is he? Please don't hurt me! Now! Where is he now? A farm in the country. (suspenseful music) I only know the telephone number. Really I do, please, please I beg you. She's the connection. Let's go. You all right? Yeah. Next time we do that routine. I throw the the punch. You got it. Get the chopper! (engine roars) (tires screech) (dramatic music) (helicopter throbs) (tires screech) (rotors throb) (tense music) (cocks rifle) There he is! Set us on the ground! (engine whines) (rotors clatter) (trapdoor clunks) Mom? (clumping footsteps) Don't think, just run. (dramatic music) (door bangs open) Up! Ugh! Go! (gun fires) (dramatic music) Go! Hold it! Move, move, move, go! Go, go, go, go, go. Clear. Come on! Go! Get 'em outta here!. Go! Get 'em out Black! Get 'em outta here, now! (dramatic music) (dripping water) (tense music) (music builds) (multiple gun shots) (dramatic music) (multiple gun shots) (siren wails) (tires screech) (gunshot) Oh! (groans) (shouting) Wing him! (people shouting) (siren wails) Let me get up! I'm okay. Let me go! Stay down! Stay down, you're hurt! Let me get up! Get 'em outta here! My little girl. My little girl. (shouts) I'll get her, I promise. Which way? That way! (dramatic music) Let me get up! (dramatic music) (sirens wail) (skid to a stop) (tense music) (pants) (splashing water) (debris falls) (suspenseful music) (soil thuds) (rocks clatter) You all right down there, John? Davenport! Where is she? Where's the little girl? Where's Genevieve, huh? The one that wasn't really in the water barrel. Where is she? Let me out! Let me out! She's dead! I still wanna know where she is! Where is she? I can't breathe. I can't breathe. What's wrong, John? Is it cramp? Huh? Must feel like Hal being so claustrophobic and all, huh? Tell me what does it feel like? What did it feel like to put that family through it? Huh? What did it feel like to put one of my cops through it? Is it hell, John? What does it feel like you sick son of a bitch? (yells) (gunshot) (panting) (water trickles) Game over. (forlorn music) (indistinct radio chatter) (helicopter engine whines) Chief. You got time for the news people? (rotors clatter) (radio beeps) (indistinct radio chatter) (distant banging) Water barrel. (tense music) (lid scrapes) (lid bangs) (water splooshes) Over here! Bring a rope! And a harness! (dramatic music) It's okay, sweet. Here I come. Mom! Put it down, put it down! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Baby. Baby! I've got you sweetheart. Okay? Oh, baby. No! Is my mom, okay? Yeah. She's okay. Everybody's okay. I'm here, come up. Come on up. (gasps) Pull her up! Pull her up! (dramatic music) Mommy! Get the paramedics. Move! (overlapping shouts) (sobs) All right, they've gotta take her. It's important. We gotta take her. (sobs) We gotta take her. Come on, come on. We got you. It's all right. I don't think you understand. He abused his power. He went above the law! He also saved your partner and your children. That doesn't justify violating me! The fact is we'll sue for damages later, but right now we demand nothing less than Davenport's removal from the force. No, sir. It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry your client was inconvenienced but that's out of the question. Inconvenienced? (door opens) I was strip searched for Christ's sake! Lucas! You did it! (door closes) Hey, my hero. Way to go kid. What he did was arrest my client without cause. imprison and interrogate her, abrogate her rights. And by the time we're finished suing this city, you'll be lucky if Mr. Davenport's the only one who's fired. I don't think so. Why? Because we're so grateful that you solved a crime? Well, actually, because Dr. Wolf here is gonna be appreciative if no one finds out about Carlos Sanchez or William Acres, to name a few. I-I-I don't believe this! You-you're blackmailing me? Would someone explain to me? Go ahead, tell him Dr. Wolf, Tell him how you've been treating sex offenders without notifying the proper officials. Go ahead. Tell him. Oh, you son of a bitch! Yeah. Counselor, would you inform your client if she doesn't get outta my office now she could lose her license and go to prison. I think we should talk. Thank you. Hey guys! Hey, hey, hey! You're the best. Helen Manette signed a complete confession. Yep. By getting rid of Andi and our kids, she wouldn't have to share the Tower Manette trust fund with anybody. Tower dies from the stress and then she gets everything. It's sick. How are they? The Manettes? The youngest girl, Genevieve. She wouldn't have lasted the rest of the day if Lucas hadn't have found her. What about Andi and the older one? Physically, okay. Mentally, not too good. Dad's with them down at the hospital. They got Black in the room next to them. He took it real hard about Cheryl. Yeah. (phone rings) You okay? Yeah. Lucas, are you sure you don't want- No, I got something to do. (door closes) (traffic rushes past) (engine throbs) (door opens, closes) (slow footsteps) (forlorn music) (mellow music)
