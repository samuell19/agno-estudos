1989. The Federal Republic of Germany is the richest country in the world. Law and order are firm components of a society in which everything runs like clockwork. German industry has solved all problems. Everything is green. There are no more energy problems. There is no pollution. No inflation or unemployment. The chemical industry has found solutions for sweet dreams. There are no more harmful drugs. All entertainment and information on television and in the press is formulated and transmitted by one single combine. The president of the combine is known as “The Blue Panther.” He has just one enemy. Krysmopompas Jansen! Do you read me? Anton speaking. Jansen! Do you read me? Jansen! Do you read me? Based on Per Wahlöö's novel “Murder on the Thirty-First Floor” Why doesn't he report? No time to lose. He's never there when I need him. - He may be at the Cop Club. - Then get' him out! He's always at the Cop Club when I need him. Jansen! Jansen! Boss? Boss! I have to talk to you. It's an emergency. The chief wants you. You're out of shape. I'm going to change now, MK 1 Anton. It's really urgent. Cut the sirens. We don't want to attract attention. Please cut your sirens. We have less than an hour. More than enough time. 53 minutes, Anton. And 12 seconds, boss. Frau Schulze is in amazing shape. In the laughing contest's 16th hour the finalists feel fine. Herr Otto has returned to us. Everything points to him as the title favorite. Hello, me again. Barbara. And what have I got for you? The weather. Today will be a lovely sunny day. THIRD ANNUAL LAUGHING CONTEST No clouds or rain. Just sun. Just sun, wonderful sun. Sorry. You okay? Now I missed the elevator. Help me fasten my blouse. - Why the camera? - Does it bother you? - You're a cop! - So what if I am. I'm No. 6, the personnel manager. Lieutenant Jansen. From Police HQ Special Forces. - Jansen. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. There he is. In revenge for the murder which you have committed, a bomb has been planted in the building. It is fitted with a timer and is set to explode at precisely 14:00 on 23 September. It's obviously a madman. Ah, a madman. I think a woman's behind it. - A woman? - One of my uncle's jilted lovers. Then it's clear. We must evacuate the premises at once. That's impossible! We have 4,100 employees. Of course it's possible. Even if you do have 4,100 employees. That's our Psychiatric Center. - It's nothing to do with us. - Oh, I see. It's nothing to do with you. I must consult my cousin. He's the CEO. The lieutenant is here. They're making fun of you, Blue Panther. Good day. They are worse than politicos. - Looks like me. Who's Krysmopompas? - Your nemesis. BLUE PANTHER HATES KRYSMOPOMPAS I see you are one big happy family. I'm not related. The lieutenant doesn't appreciate that we can't switch off 48 channels. Not to mention our newspapers and magazines. Millions of people will expect them tomorrow. He says we must evacuate, cousin. I haven't explained to him yet how many millions a break in production would cost. Never mind the cost. We must put human life first. You really think there is a bomb in the building? I can't be sure. My people will report finds at once. But it's like you said. First and foremost one must think of human safety. You are right. Get my car. Attention please! This is an evacuation drill. Please leave the building at once. Use the stairs. - Tell him to open his window. - Hey! Open your window! It's safer! It was probably the 31 st floor. - What did he say? - It was probably the 31st floor. - The 31st floor? - Yes. It's a company joke. Whenever anything goes wrong we always blame the 31st floor. It's just a saying. That sounds bizarre. Follow floor-manager instructions. Disabled persons should head to the emergency elevator. Could the building collapse? I can't say. If it does, they'll say we did it ourselves. For insurance. Everybody knows it's too small for the combine. I see. Isn't business booming? It's outgrowing the building. The current time is 13:59 and 49 seconds. Ten! Cut the music, jerk! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! - Are you in charge now? - Yes, if the other two aren't here. I see. Then send everyone home. Everyone. Everyone? But what about the costs? The costs, lady, don't interest me at all. The executives are very upset, Jansen. I did my best, chief. The people expected a bomb to go off. Their sense of security will be shaken. The executives feel you should have sold it as a drill. My God, boss. You know that 20% of people pay no attention to fire drills. I know you're my best man, but' this is a special case. You can't mess with these people. The culprit must be found at once. I'll certainly do the best I can. But I need time. We have few leads. Chief. Don't forget I'm your superior. I think you worry too much about that, chief. No, no, no. That's... You have four days. Four days to solve the case. You must succeed. Four days? I'll do my best. But why the deadline? Why only four days? That's all the time I've been given. Four extremely short days. You'll understand when you come over. I must consult my cousin. He's the CEO. Anton, is that you? Yes, boss, it's me. The bomb-threat report. Fast or what? Refrain from unnecessary comments. Anton? Wood-free, high quality paper. Folded and torn from a sheet, not cut. - Why the camera ? - Hey, Anton! Fresh newsprint. No more than three days old. The envelope is from the combine. A postage-paid envelope for magazine subscriptions. No fingerprints. And the post office? It was mailed from a western district between 9 p.m. Wednesday and 9 a.m. today. Damn TV cameras. What do they want this time? Our latest Cop Club show. Vitamin C. Oh, I don't like shows. What did the psychologist say? Nothing yet. Please clear the forecourt. A very warm welcome indeed to our Police Therapy Center. Looks like it'll be a bad night. A nightmare, lieutenant. We ban alcohol, as it makes people aggressive. Then we form a society that makes them drink themselves silly and beat the shit out of them for it. Watch your tongue, Anton. Never say that again. Understand? Never. Yes, lieutenant. Krysmopompas! Krysmopompas! Krysmopompas! FIRST DAY YOUTH CLUBHOUSE Lieutenant. PRECINCT 16 What are you doing in my desk? Well? - Out with it. - Bicarbonate will help you think. Can I move again now, lieutenant? Get my bicarbonate ready. The psychologist says there's a 50:50 chance our man is a woman. He or she definitely feels wronged by society. The psychologist says it may even be a group. He says the culprit may strike again. That's the psychology. Thank you for that really thorough analysis. And now for the chemistry. The lab traced the paper. It was made by a machine belonging to the combine. Really? - The combine's machine? - Yes, the combine's. The paper is used for special awards given by the combine to workers who have been worthy ambassadors. Most are presented on retirement. Anton, this letter is addressed to me. - I opened it when I came in. - I see. - Gold? - The lab found gold dust in the glue. - Make me a coffee too. - Yes, boss. They match. Simply torn in half. I visited the personnel manager. She said they only awarded around 25. She's drawing up an exact list. I see you're slowly beginning to learn the things I have struggled to drum into you. Ha! And it only took me seven years. Refrain from unnecessary remarks. Get me the list. Yes, lieutenant. My cup! Morning, lieutenant. Good morning. The Culture Ministry has assessed your astrological observations. POWER GOES TO YOUR BELLY. NO LOVE TODAY! A favorable star constellation... YOUR RECORD IS FAIRLY SAFE. Excuse me, lieutenant. Refrain from unnecessary remarks. Your man. This Anton, he was at the combine. Snooping around. He had my express permission. Do things alone from now on. Just you. Treat this case as a state secret. Inform no one of your methods. Don't even tell me about them. I don't quite follow, chief. And don't forget the final deadline. I... You have until Monday at noon. - Do you know her? - It's the personnel manager. - What happened? - She fell from the 13th floor. The 13th floor. - Suicide. - It would be the first in four years. Sorry, I meant premature death. Good thing you thought of that. - Murder? - Yes. Exactly the word used in the threatening letter. But the very idea is grotesque. This organization has never witnessed a murder. Really? Any premature deaths? No. This is a first. Poor dear. Who knows why she jumped. She was working on a list. We believe that... Yes, you'll get your list! You have enemies. Individuals. Nonconformists. Groups. Minority groups. Competitors. Haven't you seen our programs? I don't watch much television. Then have a look at this! Lieutenant, here you see the spirit and essence of the combine. - It is the soul of our organization. - So I see. How many viewers do you think we have right now? I couldn't tell you. 99.3% of all households. That's monstrous. And we'll go up to 99.9% by tonight if the contestants keep going. You see, we have no competitors. We have no enemies. People clearly like what we do. I think Little Rita will win. Last year she won the bawling contest. - You're not laughing? - Not on duty. Never when I'm on duty. The people upstairs are going too far. Krysmopompas must... Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know... JANSEN: POLICE ACADEMY GRADUATE POSITIVE: 15 PREMATURE DEATHS IN ANTI-POLITICO CAMPAIGN 44 ANTI-ALCOHOL ARRESTS Good to know. NEGATIVE: THIRD-DEGREE ALCOHOLIC Do you have what you need? I've instructed my workers to cooperate in every way. Thank you. In the combine I need complete freedom of movement. That's absolutely necessary for the investigation. One thing I ask of you is that you investigate undercover. The employees mustn't be reminded of yesterday's incident. We've prepared a special identity card for you. This will give you access to virtually the whole building. Including the 31st floor? You already heard about that? Very well, you might as well know everything from the beginning. Yes, it is true that we have a mysterious secret department. After hours this department is responsible for hunting evil conspirators. PERSONNEL MANAGER Elena Farr. No thanks. Do you know the girl? - Incredible! - Refrain from unnecessary remarks. - I've seen her here. - Really? She's playmate of the year. - Or she was once. - Really? - Her name escapes me. - Elena Farr. Friedrich-Anton-Richard-Richard. Anton? She was last here in April. She only uses soft stuff. Two arrests for graffiti. That's all. For graffiti? Have you got her address? They all live around there. - Do you know where it is? - In the west. Hello, here's Barbara. What have I got for you? Right, the forecast. It will be sunny, not cloudy. No clouds, nothing. Clear skies, blue skies. Sun. Sun. Hey! Do you know Elena Farr? Friedrich-Anton-Richard-Richard? - What are you doing? - I'm looking for an Elena Farr. She moved. Don't ask me where. - When? - Don't ask me that, either! Let me see some ID. I'm from Criminal Investigations! - Oh, sorry. - I'm sorry, Lieutenant Jansen. It's a routine random check. Don't take it personally. I don't. Is it true you always crack your cases? Refrain from unnecessary questions. Your surveillance was amateurish. I'll have to report you. Regrettably. Boss, it's urgent. I must speak to you! Don't turn me off! It really is... You will defeat Blue Panther, Krysmopompas. Elena Farr. Krysmopompas. SECOND DAY Jansen! Jansen! Do you read me? Report, Jansen! Jansen speaking. The case has been solved. - By whom? Who was it? - By the head of the combine. He suspected someone, who confessed when confronted. You need to take down his confession. - His? How do you know it's a he? - I don 't know that. But you'll determine the sex when you interrogate him. Or her. Jansen, don't hang your head. The head of the combine just had a head start. Your record remains intact. Take down the confession. Then everything will be forgotten. Do I make myself clear? Yes, quite clear. Now just tell me how it was. What is there to tell? It was a rainy Wednesday. I was bored. Wednesday is the most boring day. Don't you think? I don't like Mondays. Sometimes Thursdays are terrible too. So I got the idea. But my uncle blamed the comics. - He blamed the comics? - Don't you know it? Krysmopompas. Evil... Refrain from unnecessary comments. Krysmopompas! Krysmopompas gave me the idea. So I composed a threat. I cut out letters from Wednesday papers, glued them to the award, put it in an envelope and mailed it to the combine. That's the whole story. I swear. I hope you won't send me to jail. Not necessarily. Try to remember exact details. Were the scissors you used to cut out the letters the same as the ones you used to cut the award in two? - I don't remember. - Don't you? They may have been the same, or different. You have a lot of scissors. I have several pairs on my desk. You can check if you like. - Satisfied? - Yes, I'm satisfied. Very satisfied. Jansen? Jansen, do you read me? Come on, answer. Can you hear me, boss? Jansen! Jansen? Do you read me? I must speak to you urgently. Don't turn me off, boss. - I've got him. - Who keeps interrupting? How did you know he was lying? Do you have any hot leads or any clues at all? I need a hot meal. Jansen speaking. The list of employees who received the award. Has it come in yet? This morning, lieutenant. Check whether Elena Farr is on it. Friedrich-Anton-Richard-Richard. No, sir. Elena Farr isn't on it. Are you sure? Never mind. Bring me the list anyway. Thanks. The surveillance report on Anton. He was seen last night with a known politico. Increase surveillance. - The latest lab report, boss. - Amazing. It explains the cut-out letters. Really? They are from a Wednesday paper. You're up on proceedings. Don't you remember? The letter was mailed on a Wednesday. - Yes. - It fits, right? It fits. - Right. What shall I do now? - Nothing. - Why? - You're going home. To pack your bags and take some unpaid leave. - But why? - Because I say so, Anton. God damn it, I have a right to know. Why? Anton, could it be that you are drunk? No, but that's not a bad idea. Krysmopompas! Krysmopompas! Freeze! Don't move! Freeze! I came to apologize to you for my nephew, lieutenant. That wasn't really necessary. You shouldn't have resorted to psychoterror. We chose the least painful option. It was degrading. And not only for my nephew. You should have come to me. My methods are more efficient than your humiliating and vulgar ones. I see! Police methods are vulgar and humiliating? I've spoken with the minister. He agrees with me. This case is more than a nuisance. That's right. It's more than a nuisance. He's prepared to forget the whole affair. Jansen. You should forget everything too. - Yes, I understand that. - There you are. - But... - But what? But I can't. It would spoil my record. Boss! I must speak to you urgently. Please! Boss! Hands up! Look out! I'm okay. Give me my gun. Get that one! I'll take the other! I'll get you! - MK 1 Anton, do you read me? - Yes, boss. Report a premature death. Now they've got a hold over you, lieutenant. Refrain from unnecessary thoughts. You were following me! I have to talk to you. Privately. I've been... I found someone who knows certain things about the combine. I contacted him last night. - He told me... - But Anton, we know that already. This person is a politico, isn't he? Yes. He told me that too. He said the combine has a special department. The answers to all our questions are on the 31st floor, he said. Fine, Anton. We'll see. THIRD DAY - She doesn't live here anymore. - I know. Your name is Alex Zerling and you're on my list. All right. It's time the truth came out. Being bought off by them became pretty normal after while. But in fact, I'd sold my soul many years before that. Before I went to work for them as one of those unsung heroes who write the fabulous adventures of the Blue Panther. I felt safe. I knew everything about them. About the murder? Murder, rape, theft, slander, falsified reports. Write it down. I know everything. I know everything they do. On the 31st floor? - You know about it? - Have you been there? Has anyone ever been there and made it out again? I don't know. You mentioned rape. When the head of the combine does it, it's called a fling or a bit of fun. But I'd call it rape, wouldn't you? All those innocent girls with their sweet little asses and little tits. So you wanted revenge? I wanted justice. But I was a coward. I let them pay me off. Just like the spirit of evil. Krysmopompas. - Do you know my stories? - Yes, some. Then, little by little, as I sat here thinking, I came to realize I'd been punished. I knew there'd be a knock on the door one night. A POLICEMAN IS MAN'S BEST FRIEND! I'll get my things. I'll only be a minute. Tell me... That award of yours. Do you still have it? Of course I do. It's my most treasured possession. Would you like to see it? Yes, I would. If you still have it. I'll only be a minute. - You're going? But you'll be back? - Of course. Right away. I'll be right back. A premature death. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten... eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen... 15, 16, 17, 18... 19, 20, 21, 22... Carry on, Jacqueline. 23, 24, 25... Zerling's hanging there, wriggling! Mommy! Zerling's hanging there, wriggling. Jansen speaking. Send an ambulance. - I think we have our man. - Yes, boss. Look what I found, Uncle. Is it yours? Zerling's award. - Jansen speaking. - Yes, boss. Cancel that ambulance. And stop listening to music at work, MK 1 Anton! Wait for me, Anton. Hello, I'm Barbara. I'm Lieutenant Jansen, I wanted to ask you a few... I'm not home right now. Leave your name and your telephone number. Lieutenant Jansen! I need some information. - MK 1 Anton speaking. - Come in! - Chief? - Jansen? - Jansen! - Jansen isn't here. - Hello, who is it? - Lieutenant Jansen. - Sorry? - Lieutenant Jansen. I'm conducting an investigation. Well, come in then. Come in, come in. Show me your badge. Ma'am... This investigation concerns a rather... It concerns a rather delicate affair. It's about your former employment as editor-in-chief. The bomb. - Yes, you know about it? - Of course. I have my contacts. I haven't really retired from the Golden Lady. A glass of Escorial Green? I see you know something about art. It was a gift from an artist. A great artist. The head of the combine. A genius. A true Renaissance man. Why did you leave your job, then? That was no job, Mr. Police Dog. - Wait a minute! Dog! - It was a mission, a real mission. Dog! That's monstrous. - It was a revelation for me. - A revelation, of course. - I leave when my mission is over. - It must have been high time. In no time at all, I'd made my show into a spectacular. It hit 99% in the ratings. “How?” you ask. Self-sacrifice. Living only for my mission. I opened my heart to the countless viewers. I satisfied their natural desires. I gilded their humdrum lives with sweet dreams and erotic songs. What kind of songs? Erotic ones. Erotic songs. When you left the Golden Lady you received an award, didn't you? Of course. It means an awful lot to me. It's a reminder of all the letters from my devoted fans. Good people from all walks of life. Laborers, physicians. Telephone operators, midwives. Tinkerers? - May I see? - Yes, of course. Actually... no. It's not here at the moment. My associate has it. She's getting all the stars I know to sign it for my album. - Is it that urgent? - Yes, you could say it's urgent. Darling? - Yes? - Come in for a moment. You can sign it too if you want, Mr... Lieutenant! - Oh yes, you did tell me. - Yes, I did. Hello. - Hello. - Darling? Be careful. They're still dirty. I don't know where she gets the seeds. It's illegal, isn't it, lieutenant? Yes, it's illegal. Like so many other things. The lieutenant wants to see my award. Do you still have it? Yes, I do, but not here. It's at home. Don't feel any pressure to sign it. With your job, I wouldn't either. I'm so glad you understand. - I'll be at home in an hour. - Thank you. The chiefs been calling all day. I know. Is he annoyed with me? More furious, I'd say. He thinks you're ignoring him, whatever that means. He calls you ungrateful and reckless. - And unkind. - Unkind? - Yes! - How monstrous! He said to remind you about Monday, that time is running out. We have 17 hours and 50 minutes left. - How much time? -17 hours and 50 minutes! Shall I shoot? No. Refrain from unnecessary remarks. Curse you, Krysmopompas! - What did he say? - Krysmopompas! Aha, Krysmopompas! What's going on here? Report a premature death, Anton. An overdose. Too much sugar in his dreams. - Are you feeling okay? - I'm fine. I need a boat. - A boat? - Exactly. Will you join me? No. I have some questions to ask you. You have to be careful cooking these. One minute they're harder than al dente. The next they're all mush. You were very upset that day I saw you on the 30th floor. You know the CEO. He's a difficult man. But you got involved with him. That's right. - He promised... - What? To behave. As always. And I believed him. Which department do you actually work for? I'm the CEO's assistant. - His mistress. - Yes. Any objections? I sketch too. Why me of all people? Because I think you have a good face. - Really? - For drawing. Oh, for drawing. They're great. I like seeing pictures of me. - This is my favorite. - This is your favorite? Very nice. Barbara said you were her associate. I'm more useful to Barbara as a CEO assistant. Take a look at this. A glass of Escorial Green? You refused that drink because you're a shrewd man. The combine CEO tried to get rid of Barbara like that. But she won't give in either. - The vegetables! - Vegetables are forbidden. Just like this wine here, and this video tape and graffiti. That's why I became her ally. Now we're friends. You're her spy, aren't you? - Exciting, isn't it? - Are you a politico? - Typical cop talk! - Now, now. Not afraid of being arrested? I've already been arrested and released. - Won't you stay for lunch? - No, thanks. You're just like all the other cops. You forgot to ask me about Barbara's award. It completely slipped my mind. The suspense is killing me! Maybe someone will break the world record. And now, dear ladies and gentlemen. There'll be a new world record if you manage this, Little Rita. Ladies and gentlemen, you're watching history in the making. First Einstein and Napoleon and now this! Give her a big hand. She's done it. We have a new world record. What a feat! What an unbelievable achievement! She made the Guinness Book of Records. She won the Third Annual Laughing Contest! FOURTH DAY 31. I've been waiting for you. Really? Then admit sending an anonymous letter to the combine. Show me your badge. No, I'm not prepared to admit that. How fast did you get here? My best time from the combine was 50 minutes, 33 seconds. You wrote the letter to the combine. Why don't you just admit it? I assume I'm not the first person you've talked to. You could say that. I'll tell you the truth. Are you pressed for time? Not anymore. When did you leave your job? My resignation became effective exactly 47 days ago. You were in the crowd when the combine was evacuated. Why? I was visiting the Psychiatric Center. - Visiting friends? - Yes. I have lots of friends there. Ex-colleagues. They're all patients. When you left the combine you were given an award. I'd like to see it. I no longer have it. - Why won't you just admit it? - No. Go on, admit it. You sent the threat to the combine. What was your job? I worked on the paper as a culture editor. - So you must know the combine well. -I know everything about it. About the murder too? Yes. That above all. And the special department? I did work there. For 7 years, 4 months and 17 days. - On the 31st floor? - Yes, on the 31st floor. Really? That's amazing. Show me the 31st floor then. Come on, show it to me. Come on, show me the 31st floor. Over here, please. The 31st floor is soundproof. A customized attic. Directly above the executive suite. It has no windows, artificial lighting and air conditioning throughout. Optimal. A door opens onto the 31st floor, leading you to two other doors. One of them is always locked. You've seen that one. Not really. Tell me more. We were the only ones with a key. It was an electronic door. Was it this key? That's a pass key for executives. What does the special department do? Nothing. That doesn't tell me an awful lot. Okay, I'll explain. The newspaper where I worked was acquired by the combine and I got a tempting offer from the CEO. He said I was one of the nation's great geniuses. He was worried that our people had lost their capacity to think. A group of talented intellectuals, myself included, were promised absolute freedom and unlimited funds to create a new newspaper and a TV feature. A series of programs. To stimulate people's minds. To make them think. He showed me a list of people who had accepted his offer. They were the best. 23 men and women. The crème de la crème. Why do you say “they were the best”? We moved into the 31st floor. A dust-free attic. It was wonderful. A secret project to restore our country's sanity. It wasn't easy. Imagine. Brilliant, egocentric individualists, trying to work as a team. It was over a year before we had the first issue ready. It was bold and committed, radical but also humanistic. Probing and analytical to reveal the madness. Much to our surprise, the head of the combine was thrilled. He said it just needed a few finishing touches. Well, there you have it. The whole, terrible story in one sentence. From then on, he used the same trick. Everything we produced just wasn't quite right. We lost interest, became tired and frustrated. We lost a valuable part of our lives. Our dreams fell apart. Some of us wrote anti-combine comics and tried to publish them. But that leads to violence. So I was against it. They tried to make contact with the politicos. What he did to us was intellectual murder. Traitor, traitor! Elena Farr! It's the politicos from the 31st floor. You saved my life. - Are you hurt? - It's just a bruise. It's a police rubber bullet. AKZ, come in, please. Jansen's entering the tunnel with an unknown person. We're making good time. You needn't have made the long drive. Really? - I'd have mailed my confession today. - It's okay. It's my job. The combine got another bomb threat. On the other half of the award. The side with my name on it. - But you didn't actually plant a bomb? - I wouldn't know how if I tried. - Believe me. - Well, we'll see. Tomorrow I would have finished my eighth year. You see, that's where we differ. I stopped counting my years of service ages ago. AKZ speaking. Jansen left unknown person at Precinct 16 and is now heading for the combine. Machines. Poor Weiss. Boss? - It's me, Jansen. - Have a seat. I've been trying to reach you for two days. You have been ignoring the calls of your superior. I'm leaving my post at noon today. But I found him. I arrested him an hour ago. I know. A quirk of fate, isn't it? But why today of all days? Well, I'd... I'd rather not talk about it. Be careful. The combine knows all about your drinking habit. But they've known all along. Let's discuss a few other points. The new bomb threat. Should we be worried? No. But there's no way to be absolutely sure? You never can be with this kind of thing. - But maybe if we searched... - No! Not that too. Go to the head of the combine and talk to him. Your job is at stake now too. Lieutenant, you must go now. The chief is gravely ill. Okay, I'm leaving. These people are very powerful. - What do you mean? - Leave him now. They're waiting for him in the car. He doesn't know what he's saying. It's already started. What's started? They didn't even wait till noon, the bastards! You've done an excellent job, Jansen. MK 410, call an ambulance. We have to get him to intensive care. Leave him alone, damn it! Chief Jansen. AK 1 speaking. What's happening? Jansen's entering the combine head's house. Remain in position. Finally we've caught a man who's actually been there. Who worked on the 31st floor. Sometimes I wonder who's mad. Me or the others? Both possibilities are equally absurd. So what do you propose, lieutenant? Searching the building. And if necessary, evacuating. That's impossible. What if there really is a bomb? An evacuation? So you think the madman has planted a bomb after all? That can't be ruled out. It's certainly possible. I suggest we keep a lid on things until we're absolutely sure. Maybe we'll find something to help us understand why he wants to do it. You may be right. Let's discuss it after tomorrow's funeral. My poor nephew. I blame myself for taking this whole bomb business so lightly. I thought it was the hallucination of a madman. You've done an excellent job, Jansen. Congratulations. I've looked at your file. You hold a unique record. You've solved every case up to now. Up to now. - You rarely find men of your caliber. - Maybe. Lieutenant, haven't you noticed? This is a political conspiracy. Political? No. Krysmopompas. The spirit of evil? He's lurking everywhere. I've tried every trick in the book. But nothing seems to work. How about banning his comics? And eliminate the Blue Panther? No. He must be outwitted. Ever considered leaving the police? No. You could earn a lot more in the private sector. Is that so? Let's talk it through when this nightmare is over. My pet project involves an international network. And you're just the man for it. Everything okay, Anton? We're preparing to leave the building. - Hello, lieutenant. - Jansen speaking. Weiss wants to confess. Fine, put him on. There are still politicos on the 31st floor. Save them, please! I didn't tell you where the door is. You did tell me. There is no door, no 31st floor. I was there. There were just wires and machines. There's another door. And the bomb. I didn't plant it. The CEO did. A new trick. - Is everyone out? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes, all 30 floors were evacuated. There are still people in there. People? Where? We'll get them out through the roof. There's still time. - The power's disconnected. - I can see that! - The elevators are out. - Take the stairs! - Boss! You'll never make it. - Look who's talking! Where are they then? You still don't get it? The 31st floor. - It really exists? - Yes, it does. And how do we get there? Through a door on the 30th floor. There are lots of wires and machines, and past that, another door. This leads to the 31st floor. I'll go. How much time is left? We still have 13 minutes. You go then. Lieutenant. Here's the latest news. At about 2 p.m. today an explosion occurred in the combine building. Lieutenant Jansen suspects arson in the maintenance tract. In a dramatic operation Jansen managed to extricate three people. However, they died this afternoon from severe burns. A combine spokesman stated the damages will run into millions of marks. Anton! Aren't you going too, sir? The others are already in the new HQ. We have to disinfect the area now.
