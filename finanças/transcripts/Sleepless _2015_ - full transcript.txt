--== McEphie ==-- What's that? That's cool. How can I make a sale? It's a bit difficult at first. First, you have to have a convincing American accent. How do I do that? Didn't they teach you that in training? Instead of saying "Internet," you say, "Innernet." There you go. That's right. You're a fast learner. But I noticed that you don't have a smile in the voice. Smile in the voice. How do I explain... Wow. Like that. I'll let you in on a secret. I do this when I'm a bit desperate. Okay. I'll tell you why I'm a top seller. But don't tell anyone. It's top-secret. Do a British accent. -What happened? -I don't know. -Dropped call. -It's gone. IT is on its way. Let's get some coffee. Come on, girl. Leave that for later. -Let's smoke. -Sure. -Come on, let's go. -You guys go ahead. -Are you sure? You're coming? -Yes. Barry, come on. Take a break. The system is down. When IT gets here, the calls will start to come in again. Let's take a coffee break. I have a question. Is this where you take your coffee breaks? Why? Is it weird? Not really. I'm glad I discovered this place. I come here to de-stress, to escape from angry clients. They always hang up, or they scream at you. There was one who even tried to sue me. Can you imagine? Sometimes, I think about jumping off this building. But I won't fall. I'll fly. -You've got superpowers? -Yeah. Wait. So, if you could have any superpower, you would choose flight? Yes. It's the best. -Not really. -What would you choose? Time travel. Why? That's so corny! What, you'll go back to Rizal's era, or back when there were still dinosaurs? Of course not. -I'll use it to fix my life. -How? -There are lots of ways to do that. -Do tell. For example, I could relive my past and not make the same mistakes. Then my life would be back on track. It's also applicable to the work we do here. Really? How? Okay, imagine this. It's 1:00 in the afternoon. I'm sleepy, so I take a ten-minute nap. But then Miss Jenny sees me and she's mad. I'd just go back ten minutes before Miss Jenny arrived. Then I'd be able to take a nap, and Miss Jenny won't find out. Right? You're right. That is useful. But there's nothing like flight. -You really won't change your mind? -It's way more fun to fly. -Okay, where will you fly to? -Just imagine this view. -It's stunning, isn't it? -Yeah, but where would you go? Anywhere I want. That's the beauty of it. Okay. Okay. Imagine that view, from so high up. -I got you a sandwich. -Thank you. Wait. You made this? No. I bought it at a deli. They said they use organic hydroponic vegetables. Would you like to have dinner first? I can't, Gem. I'll make it up to you. Let's go out next week. Hey, how are you? I'm okay. What time is it? Around 2:00. You're still up? Aren't you in the day shift these days? Yeah. Were you asleep? Gem? Hey! What's up? What are you doing here? I live in the building across the street. Really? That one? I live there too. How come I've never seen you before? I just moved in. So do you know about the rooftop? Do you hang out there? -Are we allowed to go up there? -Of course. Well, I'm not really sure, but I go there sometimes. Why are you still up? Can't sleep. You too? Wait, I have an idea. You can turn this into a children's storybook. What is it? There's going to be a virus outbreak, which will lead to a zombie apocalypse. That's cute. Really suitable for kids. Hey, it's a story with a moral. And what's that? It's about how you handle yourself in emergencies. And the emergency just happens to be a zombie apocalypse? I just realized that if there were a zombie apocalypse, convenience stores would be the best hiding places. If you're in a convenience store, you won't run out of supplies. Even if you're stuck here for a month, you'll be fine. I don't agree. What? What kind of zombies are we talking about? Are you referring to the zombies from 28 Days Later or The Walking Dead? Just zombies in general. There's no difference anyway. -There is. -How? If you're talking about the zombies from 28 Days Later... they could probably break through this glass. And if that's the case, you need be on the move. You can't stay in one place too long. You can't stay in one place too long. You have to be on the move. How would you do that if you're surrounded by zombies? That's why we need weapons. A katana for me and an M-16 for you. That's a really bad plan. Why do you say that? Is that how you wanna live? On the run all the time, not knowing what's gonna happen to you? That's just how it is, I guess. You know, I think the glass is thick enough. This glass will definitely break, trust me. No, I'll be safe here. At least I'd have lots of food. I think I'll survive a zombie apocalypse. Is your insomnia caused by work? Probably. The shift schedule has messed up my internal clock. I have an idea. We can just hang out whenever we can't sleep. We can exchange boring stories until we fall asleep. It'll be effective for sure. -Yeah, we can do that. -Yeah? Sure. So, do we have a deal? What does this mean? The artist says... According to me... I don't get it. You just have to be open-minded when you see these things. I don't know. I guess... I prefer something clear and definite. Something I know for certain. You mean, something literal? Yeah, something like that. But to each his own, I guess. -Let me go say hi to the artist, okay? -Okay. Give me a minute. What do you think people will say about you on Facebook when you die? You've seen those posts, right? Don't you find those posts weird? I just saw something like that. Here, look at this. What am I supposed to do here? Am I supposed to like this? You should like it. But if I like this, then it means I like that baby girl Pia died. It means I like the situation. Okay, unlike it, then. But then it would be weird not to like it. I mean, she posted this so that people would sympathize with her. Just give your condolences in the comments section. I thought of that. But we're not really close. We were blockmates in college, but we never really talked. -You know what? You've got a big problem. -Right? -It really is. -Huge. No wonder I can't sleep. Wow! Your place is so neat. I'm embarrassed about my apartment. It looks like it got hit by a tsunami. I don't have a lot of stuff. You know what, you're really good at drawing. Is that you? Wow, you look so different. That's not me. That's Jason. Jason? Jason. My son. You have a son? Seriously? Why didn't you tell me? Where is he? He's in Canada, with his mom. So you're married? Since when? I'm not married. You're not married, but you have a kid? Why do you live apart from each other? It's a long story. No. It's okay. I haven't seen Jason in two years, since his mom and I split up. It happened so fast. By the time I realized, it was too late. Will they come back? Probably not. Jason's whole family is already there. I heard they applied for residency. These toys, they're all for Jason? His birthday's coming up. So, all these toys... I'm gonna send them to him. -You want to see videos of him? -Sure. Okay. So he's the kid in all your drawings. He has your eyes. I've been saving up. To go to Canada and look for them. So, you don't know where they live? I have an address, but I'm not sure if they still live there. His mom and I haven't talked in a while. You're really gonna send all these toys to Jason? They're not enough, actually. I've missed two of his birthdays and two Christmases. How many toys are you planning to give him anyway? As many as I can fit in this box. You seem happy. -What happened? -I got a bonus. -Bonus! -Yeah! Really? Let me see that. Show me. Not bad at all. "Not bad"? It's more than "not bad." -Congrats! -Your tips were helpful. This one's perfect. Are you sure? -Isn't it too violent for a kid? -No, it's not. -Want to try it? -Can we? Of course. -It's stuck in my neck. -Does it hurt? -Oh, no. -Just kidding. It's perfect for Jason. -Really? You're not hurt? -No. -You promise? -It's a good choice. I swear it's a good choice. Mabuhay! I'll take this. Who's that for? It's for my sister. Her birthday is coming up. I'll take this one. I think Jason will like it. -Are you sure? -Yeah. -If he doesn't like it, I'll tell him... -Do you think I'm stupid? ...my friend chose the gift. Don't insult me with your lies, okay? You're always lying to me. I've caught you so many times. You're shameless. Wow. It seems like that guy has a mistress, and the girl just found out. You bastard! You're cheating on me! You've got some nerve! Magda, let's talk about this. You're the one I love. You disgust me! Take your hand off me! You can all go to hell! You're animals! You son of a bitch! You're a worthless dad. Fuck you! Come back here! -Oh, no, you're in trouble. -Why me? They left because they heard you. It's not my fault. Of course it is. It's Berto and Magda's fault. Let's eat. -What about those two? What's their story? -Those two? -They're having an affair. -That's harsh. An affair? She might be his daughter. She's a slutty daughter then. -What if she's his girlfriend? -Not a chance. It's more likely that she's his mistress. So, you're saying that the two men that we saw here today both have mistresses? Yeah. The Philippines is full of mistresses. So you're saying most married men have mistresses? Look, there's something called the "polygamous gene." The what? Some men are inclined to cheat because it's in their genes. There must be a lot of messed up relationships in the Philippines. That's why our soap operas are always about that, about forbidden affairs and illegitimate children. Think of all the married couples in this country. How many of them might not have cheated? Not even once? Wait a minute. I have a counter-argument. See that old couple sitting at the back? Look at them. They must be what, 60, 70? And they're still together. I don't buy it. Look at Grandpa. You think he's never cheated on Grandma? No. -Oh, yeah. -But they're still together. Maybe Grandma doesn't know, or she knows but let it slide because she didn't want to grow old alone. Okay, here's another theory. An age-reversal machine. Let's make Grandpa 30 years younger, back when he was still good-looking or a bit attractive at the very least. What if a beautiful, sexy young woman danced in front of him, and the young woman said to him, "Come on, just for one night. No one has to know." -You're such a cynic. -No, I'm not. You think he wouldn't jump at the chance? I'm just being realistic. Right, Paul? So you're saying that Paul doesn't stand a chance at love. Oh, no. He does. We don't. So there's no hope for me, either? You're dragging me into this? That's gangster. Happy birthday! Miss Gem. I haven't seen you in a while. Please come in. Thanks. -Big sis! -Hi, baby! -You like it? -There you are! Why don't you eat something? Birthday wishes for Tiffany. They grow up so fast. Thank you. Time flies, doesn't it? -Gem. -Ma. I'm glad you made it. Tiffany misses you. You're getting thin. Are you eating right? Take some leftovers home with you. There's lots of food. Where do you work, again? At a call center. How long have you been there? But you haven't been promoted yet? Do you have a future there? Isn't that a dead-end job? It's all right. If you want, your Uncle Jim can put in a good word for you. There's an opening at his firm. I'm okay, Ma. Well, your Uncle Jim and I are available any time you need advice or help. Remember, you are still a part of this family. I'm gonna put some on Big Sis also. Okay, put a sticker on your sister's face. I have a sticker. Put some more stickers on Daddy. Hey! Are you free tonight? I wanna see you. Are you sure this elevator is safe? Of course, it is. It's so old, it's scary. -You have to wait three weeks... -Gem. ...just to get a reservation. -How are you? -Vince? Vince. Now this is authentic carbonara with cream and bacon. This is delicious. Who's the guy I met earlier? What's his name? He's a friend from work. Is he flirting with you? No, he's not. I forgot to tell you that you look really good tonight. -And the necklace I gave you, it really-- -Excuse me, ma'am, sir. We're fine. Is there a problem? No, I just have a migraine. That's all. Your migraine will be gone in three seconds. You know why you've been getting a lot of migraines lately? It's because you're in front of the computer for, what, eight to ten hours a day. Your job is so toxic. I'm happy at work. Okay? I have connections. -You'll get in, for sure. -Vince, I'm okay. I'm happy where I am. I'm just concerned, Gem. I mean, you know that, right? Vince, what would you do if there were a zombie apocalypse? What? What if there was a zombie apocalypse? What would you do? Why are you asking me that? No reason. What would I do if there was a zombie apocalypse? What did Brad Pitt do in World War Z? I'd run. I'd get a car and drive to a remote, uninhabited place. No people, so there should be no zombies. What about your family? Let's just drop this conversation. Okay? Let's just eat. Hello? Yeah, I'm on my way home. I know. My meeting ran long. I finished my letter to Jason. Do you mind reading it? Sure. Let me see. What would be a nice picture to send with that? Something a little... Okay, let's see. This one! It's perfect. -This looks great! -Are you sure? -Yes. He looks cute here. -Just like me. Okay. If you say so. -You're sure? -Yeah, send it. I didn't know you had this. Do you skate? That's not mine. You have a longboard, but you don't skate. Poser alert! -That's harsh. I'm not a poser. -No, it's not. -Let's skate. -I don't know how. -Let's go. Let's go. -What are you doing to me? Fine. But if something happens to me... -It won't come to that. -...you'll have to pay my hospital bills. Okay. Put your other foot down, but do it slowly. Do it while you move. Do it slowly. This seems easier. Okay. But you can only skate downhill like that. -Okay. -You have to control it. It's too fast! -Okay? Game! -Okay, I'll guide you. Don't be afraid. -Go! -Yeah! I skated all the way from there. You think you could skate on your own? -Watch this. -Okay. Gem. Why were you absent? You know they're strict about leaves. I'm just not in the mood. Why? Are you sick? No. What happened? They returned the box. The one with Jason's toys. Let's try again. We'll find their new address. Don't bother. I have to go. Okay. I'm here if you need to talk. Barry? Barry? Hey. Don't you check your phone? I've been calling you. And Miss Jenny wants to know when you'll be back to work. I'll be back tomorrow. That's good. Guess what I brought. Obviously, it's a box, but... Jason didn't receive the box, but it might be a blessing in disguise. At least now you have more time to save up. Also, I plan to fill this box with lots of gifts for Jason. Here, I bought some stuff. Which would he prefer? -This one's Superman, I think he'll-- -Gem. Or Batman. DC or... Or how about this? Yakult! I have something else here. -I'm sure he'll love-- -Gem. I have to see Jason. Barry, maybe it's better if you wait a little longer? You don't even know where they live in Canada. Do you have a visa? What about a place to stay? I have friends there. They'll help me out. You're going to apply for a tourist visa? Gem... I need to see Jason. I just have to. PASSPORT Sorry, it's such a mess in here. Whose is this? My dad's. Are you sure it's okay? Yeah. Just don't ruin it. It's his favorite shirt. Try it on. Sorry. Hey! You look good. It suits you. But something's missing. Sit up straight. Like that. Did you draw that? My dad drew that. He liked to draw, just like you. Is that you? Yeah. Dad had trouble sleeping in the hospital, so he would draw until he fell sleep. That was his last drawing before he passed away. Let's see. All right! Now you look like an executive! I look like a team leader. Add a bit of British accent. Gem? Your bathroom light is broken. Oh, wow! It's fixed! Finally. It's been broken for some time. And you just let it be? Yeah. It was like a party in here. And I just didn't have the time. I'm a busy person. Wait. Help me clean up. -You get that. -Yeah, I'll get it. -I'm nervous. -You're too serious. -Should I be more relaxed? -A little. -You could try smiling. -I'm saving it for later. I'll smile like this when I get there. Don't forget the things you learned at work. Be sure to impress the consul. You'll be great. Are you ready? I'm ready. Let's race. One round. I don't want to. It's just one round. Loser buys dinner. Come on. You'll just lose. You think I'll lose to you? -Go! -Hey! That's cheating! I don't wanna pay for dinner! Gem. Dad had trouble sleeping in the hospital, so he would draw until he fell sleep. Here's your ice tea, Ms. Jane. Jane? Well, people often get my name wrong. So I think "Jane" is a better name for me. I think "Jane" fits me better. I'd rather be called "Jane." Why? "Gem" sounds too beautiful. Too precious. The name "Jane" suits me. It sounds ordinary. Low-key. It suits me. You look like a Barry, though. And what does a Barry look like? You know, honest, kind, trustworthy. A Barry. I don't know if I should thank you or be offended. It's a compliment. A sincere one. Look at that girl over there, the one in the white shirt. She looks like a Veronica or Shirley. -Not Tanya? -Nope. Shirley. -How about those guys? -At that table? The guy wearing grey looks like a Charlie. The guy in the brown shirt is a Carlo. Carlo and Charlie are checking you out. That's gross. Carlo says, So he's British, then? Charlie, on the other hand, says, 'Hey, don't be a fool. Why do you settle for a guy like that?'" She knew what she was getting into. Why, then? Maybe she didn't wanna be alone anymore. Maybe there was no one else. I have a serious question for you. Do you realize how beautiful you are? Because it's as if you don't know. Your turn. Hey. Are you okay? I took too many leaves. But you're still learning the ropes. I got fired. Don't worry. I'm sure you'll find another job soon. I'll help you out. When will I see Jason? So how are you? Anything new? I've called everyone I know. No luck. Where did you get this? I just sold something. Don't sweat it. It was old. I didn't need even it anymore. Gem, it might take a while before I can pay you back. No problem. Just pay me back when you can. Okay? Sorry I didn't have time to wrap this. It's for Jason. So he can be awesome, like his dad. So this is all your stuff? You didn't forget anything? Call me whenever you can't sleep. What if I call you and you're asleep? I'll wake up then. Souvenir. Call me as soon as you find your family, okay? If you can do it, maybe I can, too. There. You're finally ready. Is this good? A whole lot better.
