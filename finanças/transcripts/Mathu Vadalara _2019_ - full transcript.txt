[Telugu song playing in TV] [Telugu song playing in TV] [Chanting...][Watching TV] Madam, take the blessings of the sacred fire. [Chanting...] [Chanting...] Ratna… Dear... Calm yourself, Ratna Listen to me... Let’s go to the hospital. Did you forget? What? Did we ever leave this temple without having the prashad served? No. Priest. Madam... Tamarind rice. I am making it. Hello... [Radio] Welcome to the ‘Subhodayam’ program. Today we are going to talk about Hypersomnia... Fatigue, Intolerance, Anger, Anxiety, Absent Mindedness All these are the symptoms of Hypersomnia. Here... Ratna, You think Salt is a bit low? Please leave some for me Ratna. Oh lord! Buddy, are you watching it? Tell me the story in the evening. ♫Little Bheem…Little Bheem…♫ (Humming) Every damn day! Babu... you didn’t give me the rent yet. They didn’t give me my salary yet. What? Does that mean you won’t pay me until you get your salary? Once they give me my salary, I will give you the rent, aunty. I didn’t mean that you won’t pay the rent but… I was just reminding you. Please tell your son not to urinate on our doors. Foolish kid! Idiot! How many times do I have to tell you not to urinate when he is around?! Damn! ♫Leave the sleep behind, leave that grogginess behind. ♫ ♫Leave the sleep behind, leave that grogginess behind. ♫ What? So, you are also working in the same office as well? And, you are wondering how I knew that? What? Shouldn’t you have woken me up when you woke up in the morning? Then you should have told me to wake you up last night itself. You were there when I set the alarm, weren’t you? If that was the case, the alarm should have woken you up. Why me? Yesudas! -Who the hell is that?! Sorry boss. -Here, this is the delivery list. What is this appearance? You are looking worse by the day. If you go out to deliver things with this attire, they will surely think that you are out to rob them. Yesu… at least you can give him some advice? It’s a vow, boss. Yours? -No, his mother’s. Why? -For marriage. Her marriage? -No, his. Sorry. -Anyways, don’t you worry, boss. I will clean him up and make him shine like me. Make him neat and clean but not like you. Useless piece of… Was that directed to me? -Not you, boss. This fellow here. Buffalo… -Directed at him, right? No, at you. What a joke, boss! What a joke! Are you laughing? Shave that beard off. It’s impossible to know if you are laughing or crying. Sign it. We didn’t wait this long for Bahubali movie tickets. By any chance is he giving us a bonus? It would be great if he gave us our salary first. Bonus is asking a bit much. Buddy, can you lends me some money? Let me get my salary first, greedy bugger! Come here, you shabby fellow! Here. This is your salary. Why is it only half the salary? What do you mean half the salary? It’s your salary for one whole month. Along with bonus. Four thousand rupees only? Yeah. When I joined here, you told me that the salary was 11,000 rupees. And with all the deductions, I would get 8,000 in hand. And then there will be tax cuts, right? What are those deductions? Last month, when your bike was repaired... One thousand for that. If you had got it repaired with mechanic near my house, it would have costed only 300 rupees, sir. In such places since they may steal genuine parts of the bike... I gave it in the showroom. What else did you deduct? One thousand rupees for three late deliveries. What else? One thousand for the office fund. Even with those deductions, I should still be getting 5,000 rupees. Did you forget? One thousand was deducted last month for your surprise birthday party. Did I ask for it? Did I want you to celebrate that? Why would it be a surprise if you asked for it? How would that cost a thousand, sir? We bought the cake and candles from Swiss castle. What? Didn’t you get it from Bangalore Iyengar bakery? Did you see where I got it from? Except for the piece that I cut, You took the rest of it with you, sir. Don’t talk like a child. I took it for my children. What do you want me to do, now? Just sign here. Hello, boss. Yesu! This month, there is a slight raise in your salary. Wow! This month it’s 3,500 alphabets. 3,500 are not alphabets boss. They are numbers. Take this. What’s this? It’s my donation towards office renovation. Yesu… Sign here. Sign in front of you? Close your eyes. Idiot! Someone’s cooking chicken. Babu.. Rent…. How much aunty? 3,000 rupees? 3,000 rupees? Rent is only a thousand rupees, right? Don’t you have to pay the current bill? How much? One thousand. What? One thousand for a fan that doesn’t work and a light that doesn’t switch on? Who knows? You might have been using an AC. Mom, it’s very cold inside. Why is it cold? -If you have no clothes on your body, You are going to feel cold. I understood. What did you understood? The ones who has been using a one-star AC. Five-star ACs are very costly. We are the ones who have been paying your bills, isn’t it? I am going to smash your face. Jerk! Get inside. She scolded me only. What’s the other thousand for? Maintenance…. For your maintenance? No, it’s for the apartments. Tell this useless person to have a bath occasionally at least. I am coming there. -Anyways, what’s with all this? Would anyone call this an apartment? I want to practice my dance every morning But I am scared that the building would crumble. If you find it that difficult to live here, you can vacate the house and go away. As if someone is begging them to stay here. We will build our own house. Horse faced woman! Has he been this way since the morning? Thank goodness! What are you watching? Sherlock. This is Shell lock. What do we have to eat? There is mango pickle in the jar. I will tell my dad this joke. Go on watch Sherlock. Why are you that focused on that currency note since a while? Did our boss give you a fake one? What happened? Tell me. I was wondering how should I spend these thousand bucks. Oh, that… Like this. You.. fool! Instead of going to these liquor parlours, We would have set this up at home. Consider this your home. Feel free, buddy. How can I feel comfortable? Are the drinks here free? I am stressed about the bill. You have been harping on the bill for way too long. It will reduce if you drink less. Why do you always stress about everything? Not just you. Even i got my salary today. You... -First, have your drink. I can feel myself getting fat. I am going to hit the gym tomorrow, buddy. Why does he laugh? Did he think I was joking? And this fellow here… What happened? This useless life! I’ve worked hard for thirty whole days... three.... and all of it went down the drain in three hours. Why are you talking about salary when we are on the topic of life? Buddy... After all that back breaking work, He pays me just four thousand bucks. Just Four thousand bucks. Yes buddy. It’s four fingers. What does he think of himself? Who do you mean? No, brother. He wasn’t talking about you. Close your zip. Such cheap fellow! Such cheap fellow! Yes. He is cheap. Come this way. Cheap fellow! You are drunk and are creating a scene. I can’t take it anymore. I can’t take it anymore. Just calm down buddy. No. I won’t calm down. What else can you do if not shut up? Are you going to kill yourself? Yes! Yes. Kill myself. Are you going to kill yourself for real? I am going to go back to my village. What are you going to do in the village? Something or the other. But I am going to quit this shitty job. I am going to quit. I am going to quit. What’s wrong with him? I am going to quit. Will you quit? -I will quit. Will you quit? -I will quit. Shut it! Is he going to quit alcohol? Dumb wit! Just hold him steady. Excuse me. Bro, could you give a lift to the slums of Jubilee Hills? Hello. What do you mean? Is he going to offer the three of us a ride? Nope. I meant he would at least give me a ride. Buddy, would you like to have Dosa? There is the batter. Make yourself one. There is very little water. Have a shower immediately. Yes, mom. I am fine. Yes, I got it. I will send it to you. No, I don’t need it. I will call you back. It’s all burnt. I will make it myself. Don’t I have to eat? What? You didn’t eat yet? If you would let me eat then… Ok. Fine. I’ll make them for you. Go and get ready. I told you I am going to quit from today, right? I thought you said that in a drunken stage yesterday night. Are you really quitting? Yes. What are you going to do after you quit? Are you going to watch serials just like him? I don’t know. I didn’t think that far. Anyways, who was that on the phone? Mom? What did she want? I have to send her money. How are you going to do that? With a money order form. If you order you will get Dosa... but not money. Gosh! You speak as if I am getting paid in thousands on that job. I worked like a dog for a month and got paid just 4,000 bucks. If you don’t work, you wouldn’t even get that money. I got 4,000 bucks at least. You were paid 3,000 bucks. Did you ever hold 5,000 rupees on you, ever? The waiter in that bar yesterday, gets more in tips than my monthly salary. You think only they get tips? Don’t you think we could get them too? Just looking at your face, they don’t even feel like paying you money. Tips is really a far cry. Tips are not given because of one’s face. It’s because of the service provided. I wonder what kind of service it is that you are providing. Come with me. I’ll show you. Never mind. It doesn’t matter. Buddy, listen to me. Just accompany me today. If you still want to quit then it’s up to you. Please, buddy. Come with me. Go on. Accompany him. He is eager to show himself off. Alright, fine. I’ll show you the life. Have your Dosas. Babu. Wait a second... What is this? 5,000 rupees. You told me that I never saw that kind of money, right? Where did you get this from? I saved it. Saving 5,000 rupees from the 3,000 that you earned as salary. You must be truly outstanding! Shut it! And you take it. Why? Don’t you have to send money to your mother? No. I don’t want it. Swear on me, if you don’t take it. No. I don’t want it. Swear on you, if you don’t take it. Take it. Anyways, what are you going to show me? Before I show you something, there are a few things I need to tell you. There are five rules for customer service. Rule number one: Customer is god. If the customer is god, we are the priests. Our blessings are equal to the amount of praises you heap upon those gods. Even if the customer doesn't have any sense, we must maintain decency. Buddy, It doesn't matter even if we have ruffled hair... we must always have a pleasant smile on our face. Excuse me, sir. Oh dear! When the customer opens the door, you must greet them with a good morning. You should always treat them very warmly. Last but not the least Rule number five. Customer is always right. Customer is king. You told me that they are gods a while ago. Is that really important now? Why are you focussing on that instead of what all has been said? Hi, ma’am. A very good morning. Hope you are having a great day. I am Yesu Dasu And this is my colleague, Babu Mohan. We are here to give you the package. It’s an auspicious day Your earrings are amazing, ma’am. I don't think they are actual gold. Madam, someone is at the door for you. Ratna Madam... [Watching TV] What’s wrong with you? Please hurry. Don’t be tensed Ratna. Nothing will happen to me. Oh goodness! What happened...? why did you stop? You forgot to put your seat belt on, Ratna. You love me so much my husband. Who are looking for, young man? Move aside lady. Hey! Who are you people? -Sorry, madam. Hello, madam. My name is Yesu Dasu. We are here to deliver the package your ordered online. This day is your day. We didn’t order anything. Is this Ramesh Raju’s house? No, it isn’t. It’s Rameez Raja’s house. This is apartment 403, right? Yes. Then, Ramesh Raju’s house must be in. Go in and call him. Have you gone insane?! Don’t you think I would know who lives in my house? Won’t Ramesh Raja stay here? -Who the hell are you? Who the hell let you in? This watchman doesn't have any work. It's Okay, Madam... Sorry Madam. He let’s in every Tom, Dick and Harry. It’s turning into a bloody market! Ramesh Raja’s house is apartment 503. Hi, sir... A very good morning. Hope you are having a great day. I am Yesu Dasu. Enough! Who wants to hear such nonsense?! First, give me the package. Sorry sir. I was told that it would be delivered the day before yesterday. What’s the reason for delay? You have provided the wrong apartment number. That is why, it was delayed. Did it really take you two days to deliver it from one floor to another? It took us two days to figure out your apartment, sir. Never mind. How much? It’s 7,500 Rupees. It’s 7,500 rupees only. Isn’t there a discount? You bought the item when it was already on discount. I like your smile. Ok, I will get the money. Old crook! Customer is god. -Not him. Bloody old bugger. Thank you, sir. Sir… There is shortage of 500 rupees. Is that so? Yes sir. If you want, you can count it. That’s right. Sir seems to be weak in mathematics. Thank you, sir. -Hey! Let’s go. Why are you laughing? You gave me so many big tips on customer service, right? I was just recollecting them. What is this? It’s a 500 rupee note. It’s the tip. When did he give it? I took it. How? So, you mean to say that it isn’t the customers who are giving you tips? Why would I wait for them to give? I am taking it myself. That isn’t called a tip. That is a crime. Drinking and driving is also a crime. But, does that stop us? If we are caught drinking and driving, We can pay the fine and get out. If we are caught stealing… We can get out on bail. Does that mean you will steal? The 500 rupees that I took is not called stealing. What does it mean? It’s called pocketing. What is the difference? Stealing involves intimidation and robbing people. Pocketing is just smartly slipping things into your pocket. Don’t play with words and cover a crime. Buddy, don’t go overboard. Anyways, these people bought those items on discount. Now think that they bought it when there was no discount. What if you get caught? There is no way I would get caught. How? Look dude. There are two kinds of payment. One, card Two, cash. Card payment doesn't help us at all. We need cash on delivery. And we should pick those deliveries where the net value is above 5,000 rupees. The net value is inversely proportional to risk. Generally, the customers who place the order leave the house in the mornings on work. The parents or grandparents are the ones who take the delivery. They are our main targets. When we deliver the product, they give us the money. That could start from 1,000… ..to Rs.50 even. we should only take one note out of the bundle. If you get too greedy and take a couple or more we will surely get caught. If we take only one single note, they would doubt themselves and give us an extra note to compensate. Sometimes if they don’t, You have to use their age to our advantage. You will have to make them believe, confuse them... and take it from them. Take a look. If you are this clear about your strategy, Since how long you have been at this? Six months. Six months? -Yeah. Didn’t you get caught at least once in those six months? No. How much are you stealing per day? -Why do you use the term stealing again? Alright, fine. How much are you pocketing? Three to four -Hundred? No. Thousand. That means its over a lakh a month. -Approximately. Anyways, if you want to survive in a city like this, We need to have that much at least, right? Apart from that, half of it goes to charity. Since we are born as human beings, We need to do at least some charity, buddy. Is that why when boss gives you 3000 bucks you just take it, without any questions asked? Of course. I give him a tip of 500 rupees from it. And at times, I even lend him money. If it was all about doing this, why do you spew silly philosophies that ‘the customer is the king’, and as such? Disgusting! Let’s go. In life, just remember that... if you are about to embark upon a wrong path and someone gives you the lecture on ethics, at that point, your mind automatically turns onto the wrong path. It’s human nature. Didn’t you get it? Didn’t you see, they want a discount on the things they have already ordered on discount? How will these ‘cheap kings’ afford to give us any tips at all? So, just listen to me.. just as you follow celebrities on twitter, follow me in the same manner. I don’t want this kind of stolen money. Really? What kind of money do you think I gave you in the morning? Does that mean? It’s surely not the money I saved. It’s pocketed money. Damn! Why do you keep calling it robbery? Here…. This is the note that we took from him and this is the note that he gave us. Brother, we are blind. Could you please tell us if this note is valid or not? Ok. Yes. It is valid. What about this? Oh no! How dare you steal the note that I stole first? Where is the note? -Sorry, brother. Get lost. Do you think he payed attention to how we earned the money? He was concerned only with whether it is valid or not. Everyone pays attention only to that. Nowadays, if we see a rupee coin on the road, People pocket it. People themselves are not ethical. How can the money we earn be subject to criteria of ethics? You talk as if with this one note their lives will get destroyed. They are very well off. This single note makes no difference to them. But for us, this is our need. I thought that if I shared this with you, you would salute my wisdom. Instead, you are making me feel bad. I showed you everything that was necessary And told you every trick that was important Buddy, despite all this, if you want to go back to your village or stay here, is your choice. Alright... let's go. We have a lot more deliveries to make. You go on ahead. What about you? How will you return? Alright, fine. Let’s meet up in the evening. Give it a thought once more. Give it a thought once more. Buddy, are you watching it? Alright, Tell me the story in the evening. He may pee again. Delivery, huh? Yes. How many? Three. Name. Babu. Which village? Why my village name? I was just kidding. Isn’t the construction over yet? Why? Are you interested in buying? Where is the parking? It’s all vacant. You can park anywhere. What are you looking at? I am so sorry. Nothing happened to you, right? -First, turn off the vehicle. Okay. You aren’t hurt anywhere, right? First, park your bike, madam. -Okay. I am so sorry, sir. I have been telling my mechanic repeatedly to set the gear wire. That is gear less bike madam... right? I mean the brake wire. Can I help you with the bag? Damn! I am extremely sorry. Madam, it’s alright. Just go on. I can actually help you with the bag. No… No… -Just… I didn’t think that the bag was open. Sorry. I beg you, madam. Please leave... I will take care of it. Are you sure? I can help you. Thank you, madam. I will take care of it. Okay. Tejaswi... Madam! Your envelope. [Mobile Ringing] I just came here for passport verification. You mean Thomas? He is useless! He is a good for nothing fellow. …someone called Tejaswi…. I will be there in an hour. No. No. I just got here. You tell me. This? They call it Mansion heights. It’s quite tall. It’s not Mansion house. It’s Mansion heights. All you can think of is alcohol. It’s been a week since I ordered it. Ravi, apartment 501. When will it come? How would I know sir? What do you mean you don’t know? Aren’t you the one delivering it? I am just a delivery boy, sir. Please call the customer care and figure it out. Okay, Just tell me the number. The website that you ordered from would have the number. Why are you getting irritated? Don’t ever forget that customer is god. and god is great. Are you blind? -Sorry uncle. How dare you call me uncle? Rascal! Sorry Rascal. God is great, huh? Useless fellow. Hi, sir... My name is Babu. Hello. Good morning, sir. My name is Babu Mohan. Good morning, sir. Morning. My name is Babu Mohan. I am the delivery boy. This is the product that you ordered online. I am here to deliver the product. Cancel. Sir? If you say cancel now, then what will happen to me, sir. Cancel. Sir… -Cancel… Sir… Sir… Sir… Why are you laughing like that? Isn’t there anyone else at home? Oh! So.. that you can beat me up and rob the entire place, is it? You Idiot! Oh no! Madam, I am a delivery boy. What bhai (brother)? Not bhai… boy. Boy. Oh… Bye. Bye… Who are you looking for? Lady, I am the delivery… I am here to give this to you. We don’t want it. Absolutely not. Lady, I am not selling it. This is yours. Huh? Ours? Yes. You ordered it online. I am here to deliver it to you. What should we do with this? You do whatever you want. But pay me what you owe. What? Money? How shamelessly you ask for money! During our time, even when we wanted to give money, people never took it. I am a poor old woman. You are asking me without even understanding how this old woman can have any money? Here, take it. What is this? Didn’t you ask for money? Ten rupees? I didn’t have any change that is why I gave you ten rupees. If not, your face deserves only five rupees. Madam, I gave you the package, right? You have to pay money for that. What? What? Money for the package? What is this nonsense? I don’t mean that package. I meant the items packed inside the package. You have to pay for those. 8,000 rupees. Oh…8,000 rupees. You could have told that earlier? My son told me that something would be delivered here and asked me to pay 8,000 rupees. Wait here. I will get it. What? I gave you ten rupees earlier, right? Give it back. Wait here. I will be back. Madam, I gave you Rs.50 by mistake… Old hag! I am a bit thirsty. Could you give me some water? I will cook a meal for you and serve you as well. Why don’t you come in and eat? Why do you talk like that? I just asked for a glass of water. Yes, it’s my house. Otherwise, are you thinking it’s your house, Idiot. Here, drink it. Madam, It is short by Rs. 500. It is short by Rs. 500. How is that possible? My son counted it out and gave it. It’s true. You really are short by 500 rupees. You mean to say I am lying? Oh no! I didn’t mean it that way. If you wish, You could count it yourself. So, you mean to say that I can’t count? 8,000 means there should be 16 notes here. But there are only 15 notes here. When I went to get you some water, you must have nabbed a note from the pile. Look at that face. It’s like a thief. What do you mean? Why would I steal? Why would I need to do that? How would I know what your needs are? Leave all that. Hand over another 500 rupees. You steal the money and bulldoze me. You Idiot! You are going to die of worms. Madam, mind your words. What? Mind my words? Why should I? You rob me of money and trying to fool me. -Madam, what is this? Let go off my collar. Why should I? Thief! Oh goodness! You purposefully sent me inside and are playing your tricks on me. Let me go...I don’t want the money. You keep it. Just because I am old you think I am vulnerable. What is this? You are going overboard. -You! Grandma… Grandma… Thank God! I was tensed that you might have got caught. But you put the money down and got the package back. That was excellent move, buddy. Even then, he would be caught. -Hey. Who is that? I dare you to come and talk in front of me. Tell him to think hard. -Who is that? Hey, Abhi. Hi. -Hey, go away. You got the package. That’s all well and good. But your skin is under her nails. What about that? That’s a valid point. When the police come, they will find her sprawled on the floor, And then, the forensics would come in. They are going to conduct post mortem and remove the skin from her nails. And they will check that and then catch you. My foot! We are not worth that much effort. But the crime still exists upstairs. Come on! Come on! Come on! What should we do? We need four plastic covers. Oh! Coat? Is it to cut that old lady into pieces and pack her in them? Nope. So that his finger prints are not found by the forensics. Wow! Now, her fingernails have to be cut. To do that an axe would be needed. A nail cutter would do. You should have said that first, donkey. Today is Tuesday, Is it alright to cut nails today? Shut up! Just cut it! Looks like he might even paint her nails. Hey, Make it fast. There is no enough time. If someone comes, it will become a huge problem. Oh lord! Everything is over. It must be her son. Until she opens the door, he is going to keep banging on the door. And after the door opens, He is going to hit him. Please do something. Don’t fret. Check who that is from that peephole. Who is it? Is it Chiranjeevi or Balakrishna to recognise And tell immediately? Who is it? Sir, paper bill. Oh! It’s just the paper boy. He is just going to bang on the door a few more times and go away. If he stays any longer, there are two things that are likely to happen. One, the neighbours could get suspicious. Two, he might go to the neighbours and ask them. Third, the neighbours might be on vacation. First, open the door. No, don’t do it. If he sees you, It’s going to be a huge problem. It’s only going to be a problem if he sees his face. Not if it’s his hand. If he gets caught, his photo will be printed in the very same newspaper. Because it's a murder. How much is it? Why do we care? Just pay him from the pile of money that old woman had. No. If even a single note goes missing. It’s going to be a problem. Just pay it with the cash you have. That’s another dent in his pocket. Thank goodness! At last we have crossed one hurdle. What’s the delay? Let’s head out. Stop. If the body is here, Someone or the other will get suspicious. So? Do you want us to bury it in the burial ground? No. Take her to the bedroom and lay her like she is asleep. Oh lord! How would we know which room is hers? Looking at her, I get the impression that she is eccentric. Even though she is in such a well-maintained house, She must have come with her old rickety stuff. It must be this room for sure. I need an energy drink. [Song humming] Where is the charger? What’s that sound? You man! the door must have shut because of the wind. How can a door that is closed be shut due to the wind? (Humming a tune) Sir Sherlock Holmes? -Yes? Not you. First, lay that body on the bed. [Watching TV] Why this coconut water now? Let’s go to the hospital now. You know it’s very sunny outside, right? I can’t take it if you get a sun stroke Ratna. Drink Ratna. Stop Ratna. Did we ever throw away a coconut without having the tender coconut pulp inside? What’s that expression? like a player winning a gold medal at the Olympics. It appears that he has lost his stamina. -That’s why I constantly advice him to hit the gym. Ratna…. Oh no! They always end the episode with suspense. Why don’t you give her a facial as well? How did the TV get switched on? Because the electricity must have come back. When did the power cut happen? When he came by. What do you mean? When he came and rang the bell, the bell worked, right? But when the paperboy rang the bell it didn’t work, right? But he banged on the door. One knocks on the door only when there is a power cut...right? Oh my god! Blood! Blood is red in colour. The colour of ghost’s blood is red. Ghosts don’t have a body. How can they have blood? Bloody fool. If the saree that the ghost wears is white, why can’t their blood be white? Buffalo! What is this? Why do I smell toothpaste? My grandma told me that if a dead body is not cremated within half-an-hour, it will turn into a ghost. Did she tell you this after she was dead or before? Hey stop! I think that old lady turned into a ghost. Why is the ghost laughing with the clarity like in Dolby Atmos? This woman looks like a ghost herself Why wouldn’t she turn into a ghost after she died? What do you say Mr. Sherlock? Hey! we finished what we set out to do. Let’s go. I appreciate it. Hi, baby... I just woke up. Have you had your breakfast? What did you eat? Why is it Upma all the time, baby? You know what? I am thinking of having steamed rice cakes dipped in lentil vegetable stew. Yes... Sambar- Idli. It means, you did all of this while there was another person in the house? Yes. Do you think she saw him? If she saw, she would be really shocked. She wouldn’t be talking on the phone calmly. Yeah. Come home as soon as the flight lands. I will be waitin… Madam, did you call me? I will call you back. Instead of calling you, I should fire you. Funny girl. Why are you laughing? What I mean is…. The shower in the bathroom isn’t working again. Is it? I will take a look. At me? No, madam. At the shower. Don’t just look at it. Learn to repair it. Yes, madam. I will do it. Hey! what are you doing? I am removing my shoes. Don’t... Your socks stink. Come. [Song humming] Don’t be tensed. There is no chance he would come into the bathroom. Fine, he won’t come in. What if she enters? Then, we will think of a way to deal with it. Deal with what? Her? Cheap fellow! Isn’t grandma around? Why do you care? I was just making conversation. Just look into your job. This is the one, right? Why are you acting like it’s your first time here? Correct, madam. He is coming into the bathroom. There are so many rooms in the house. Why should he come to the bathroom only? By the time he reaches the bathroom door, Just lock the bathroom from inside. Go. Go. Hello… He looks to be the jack of all trades. He put it here, alright. How is he going to take it? He looks quite harmless but is quite cunning. Then that means When he got in, the camera must have recorded that, right? Yes. Is it done? Yes, it’s done. Is it working? Yes. It’s working very well. He means the camera. That is what you say but within two days, the shower doesn’t work again. If it doesn’t work. I will come back here again madam. Yes, to change the SD card. Alright.. Go. Ok, madam. Bloody pervert! Yes. You are saved because the card accidentally fell into the toilet. (Singing a nursery rhyme) What are you guys doing? We are thinking about him and he in turn is thinking about the girl. He is very great. (Singing a nursery rhyme) Yes. I just got out of the shower. Oh no! You know that I have to bathe two times a day. Just like us. Ok, baby. Got to go. Bye. Love you. I wonder what that old lady is up to. Grandma… Grandma… Are you a sleep? That means I can go out. January… February… March… April… Oh good... You are back. Looks like that girl left. Just take your bag, hurry up and leave. Did you take the covers? Buddy, don’t touch anything with your fingers. Pull… Pull… …do something Hurry up and pull… Oh my god! You pathetic person! That’s it. Over... Everything’s over... You cannot ever get out of here. What's your situation now? This shitty life. -Hey..silence. Give either of us a call. Yes... Call… call…call. Hello… -Hello… I am Babu. I thought my father. Tell me. Where are you? -I can’t hear you well. Where are you?! I am driving. Come to Jubilee Hills immediately. Banjara Hills? All my deliveries are in Jubilee Hills. Listen to me properly. Hello… If you want me to listen carefully I must be able to hear it properly. Stop the vehicle and listen to me. Not necessary. They stopped me. Hi, sir. Call me immediately. Hey... Put a message in our WhatsApp group. Some one or the other will come. Thunder guys! Thunder guys! Damn! connect... connect.. (Message) [I am stuck in flat no.401, Mansion heights, Jubilee Hills with one old dead lady] [One of you come fast and open the door.] Come. Come… Let’s go. Can you give me a glass of water? The kitchen is that way. Khichdi is there as well. Do you want to have some? Give me some water. -Okay. They look like they are going to get really crazy in the bedroom. You go to the grandma’s room. Is this the room? Hey… take it off you…take it off you. -I will... Don’t crumple it. Disgusting! Do we have to watch their romance? Then close your eyes. Then, shut your mouth. After all this, he opened a packet of curry powder. It’s not curry powder. It’s 'Veedaku' packet. It’s his packet of leaves. I never said it was my packet of leaves. 'Veedaku' means Marijuana. Marijuana? Does that mean they are going to enjoy themselves? What is this? Do we have to mix it in water like saffron stalks and drink it? Saffron stalks are mixed in milk and consumed. Oh dear! We don’t have milk at home. Shh... You... What is this? Why are you crushing them? Do we have to put them under teeth like tobacco? -Put in under your body! Hurry up and put it somewhere or the other. Tissue paper? She wants to know everything. Control yourself please. Do I have to inhale it or blow on it? You have to swallow it. Hey. Take a drag and exhale. Do you have a lighter? Do I have to get everything? Not so loud. Grandma might wake up. She won’t get up. Why? I mixed the powder you gave me in a bottle of water and gave it to her. She is completely knocked. Have you gone mad? What if she accidentally dies? She is already dead. If she dies. She dies. Damn! What happened? He drank from the same bottle, the grandmother drank from. It must be because of the drugs in the water... Reaction started in his mind and that’s why he is thinking we appeared here. Oh, is that why he’s become so sharp-minded? I am getting high. You are not the one getting high. He is the one who is getting high. It’s really nice. -My fate. Buddy, don’t fall asleep. You sleep like a log anyways. But now, if you sleep because of these drugs, you will surely never wake up. Please don’t sleep. Babu… Where have you been? -I have been trying to reach you. Where are you? I am outside the apartment. Stay right there. -I am right there. You... What happened? You were joking with me, right? Hey, Babu! Babu… Little Bheem… Little Bheem Babu, what happened? I am talking to you. What happened? Why are you behaving this way? Why is he packing? Oh my tumbler! Did the boss say something? If he did say something, tell me. -I will take care of it. Shut it! Tell me what happened? Babu… tell me what happened? -It’s all your fault. You, dumb! Bag… Bag… Where is the bag? Bag…? Where is the bag? Here… I asked you to pocket only a single note of money Why did you get so many bundles of them? Where did you get so much money from? Babu…. I know that you are at home. Come out. Come out. You can’t escape. Come out. Babu, you cannot escape. Who is it? Babu.. Police. Where is Babu? I think I’ve heard this voice somewhere. Hey, Yesu. You are at home as well? Sheshu? What’s up man? What’s with this look? What movie is this from? Take a guess. Gauthami Putra Shatakarni? That is a periodic movie. Oh? Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Give me another chance. Head constable Venkata Ramaiah? Khaidi No. 150? Yes. Boss is back. Wow. Is it a big role? Yes. I play a 60-year-old man. So, what do you do? Hmm… So, I stand like this. Put it here and …. Sheshu… Sheshu… -This is the role. How much longer will you take up these kinds of roles? When will you become a hero? Me? A hero? You are going overboard. I asked you to reprimand them. Why are you indulging in a conversation? Babu, If this repeats, I am going to (Cheeresta) thrash you. We will dress accordingly by wearing pants. Wear a saree… wear a pant. Wear a saree… wear a pant. You are brilliant, Yesu. Brilliant. Husband. -I am coming. Yesu, just thrash lightly. The boy is all swollen up. And my wife is making a mess. Alright. Alright. Alright, fine. -Go away. It’s time for my shoot. I will meet you tomorrow. Ok Alright. Go away. Twisted fellow! -Be careful! Don’t blame me later. What exactly happened? How come you resorted to robbing? Two people are dead there and how come you are asking this kind of question. Anyways, it’s not called robbery. It’s called pocketing. Bloody Idiot! Shut up! Okay. How did you come from the bedroom into the hall? I don’t know. Whose is the second dead body? I don’t know. When I woke up, it was next to me. How could you sleep with all that stress? You idiot! How many times do I have to tell you? Something was mixed in the water. So, I was drugged. So, what should we do now? What else? Take these 50 lakhs and run away. Have you gone mad? It’s 50 lakhs buddy. We could all settle down comfortably. It’s 50 lakhs here. Not 50 crores. How long can you survive on 50 lakhs? Even if we spend a lakh a month, we could live happily for three years. And after that? What will you do after that? I have no clarity over what to do now and you ask me questions regarding three years later. Babu, this is what he will keep on telling you. Listen to me once this time. It’s because I listened to you. All of this happened. So, what will you do now? You have three problems right now. One is camera. Second is the bag, Third is the bike. Oh my! I forgot about the bike. That’s not at all a big problem. If you have the key, you can bring it. The main thing that we require is that camera footage, and delivery packages. If either of them gets into the hands of the police you will surely be caught. If there is a camera in front of that house, everything would be recorded in it. So, the first thing we need to do is get that footage. If this bag is here, your delivery packages must be somewhere there. You must get your packages from there. And once you do that, there will be no evidence that you were ever at the crime scene. No one will doubt you. We can get out of this mess. Is it? Do you think it’s that easy? This is not some English serial that you watch. You must first give your details to the security guy there, sign the register and then you are allowed into the apartments. Even if you manage to spew some nonsense to that security guy, do you think you can ring the apartment’s bell... pick up your packages and the camera footage? There are already two dead bodies there. And as far I can tell, that place must be crawling with both police and the people. If we go into the apartments, we will surely be caught. If he follows my plan, he will just be a suspect. If he follows your plan, he will be a convict. If he proceeds with your plan, he will be caught right away. And if he follows my plan, he can escape happily. Is running away the solution to everything? Is getting caught the solution for everything? Why do you keep insisting that he would get caught? If he gets his packages and the footage, how will he get caught? This isn’t as easy as getting curries from a curry point. Don’t make illogical arguments. Do you want me to come up with twisted solutions like yours. Babu, listen to me. He will never listen to you. It’s because he listened to you, there are two people dead. You! If you talk too much, you will die too. Remove your hand. I won’t. What will you do? I will break your spine. I will break your... I will go to the police station. What will you say at the police station? I am going to tell them everything that has happened. What do you think they would do when you tell them all that? What will they do? Speak out...come on speak out.. -I don’t know anything. Sir… I am innocent. Why would they hit me if he is the culprit? You are the one who gave him the idea, right? Babu, please don’t do that. I beg you. What do you want me to do? We can’t do what he suggests and I can’t do what you suggest either. You said the same thing yesterday and did it today anyway. This is the same thing. You! -Hey! Stop it! [Mobile Ringing] What’s wrong now? The second dead body belongs to the police officer who came for verification. What are you talking? How did he go there? Even if he did go there, how did he die? Buddy… We don’t have a lot of time. Before they begin the search for the constable, we should do something. So, listen to me. Let’s take this money and run away somewhere. Even if you run away, Where are you going to go and how are you going to live? That is why I suggested we run away with the money. You are right. Thank god. Finally, you understood. Let’s go and get those packages and the footage. Listen to me guys. If we go now, we will get caught. We are going. Will you come with us or not? I get the feeling that we are on a final journey. I wonder if there is any petrol or not. That’s not necessary. Let’s go in a car. Car? Where did you get a car from? It’s a friend’s car. You mean you have friends who own a car? Not everyone is like you. Let’s go. Where is the money? -Why do you need the money? I don’t need that kind of money. I want that money. Come lick an armpit! -If I did, will you give me the money? Just go and get the money! Okay. Man must trust. Who called you a man? Let’s go. Didn’t you hear him? Let’s go. How are we going to get in? Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I am talking to you. Go and sit in the back. -No, I won’t. Does that expression mean that I should be scared and get in the back seat? I will sit in the back. Make sure you hide yourself well. Why? It’s better if people think there is only a single person in the car rather than three people. Why? To make sure even if you get caught, we can escape unscathed. How can you go in without signing in? I am talking to you. What are you doing? -Are you trying to hit the wall? Oh mom! How did you get in without signing? They would ask the visitors to sign not the residents. I didn't get it. It’s human psychology. Only the people who don’t live in this apartment, slow down at the gate. So, the security stops them. If it’s a resident, they just honk and speed up to get in. Security doesn’t stop them. If they did stop you and asked you to sign? I would have spewed some nonsense and signed and rushed off. Let’s go. What about me? Is that the flat? -Yes. How come there is no commotion around it? I was wondering the same thing. That means nobody knows that there are dead bodies inside. Shall we go? Hey... -What man? Where is the camera? Buddy, tell me the truth. You didn’t dream this up, right? I saw the camera. Yeah and I am asking you if you saw it in a dream? Dream? Would they ever listen to us if we told them?[Phone Talk] It’s up to them. Goodness! This generation people do not listen to persons like us. Who is she? How is she talking on the phone when there are two dead bodies inside? Hey! What happened? What? That is the grandmother. -You said that the grandmother was dead. How is the dead person come alive? I am asking you. What do I know? -So, what do you know?! How did you know that the grandmother was dead? Did you check her pulse? No. I placed two fingers beneath her nostrils. -You should have put it inside her nostrils! Where is the constable’s body? It’s in the hall. Why would she move around this freely with a dead body in the hall? To figure that out, we need to go in. Goodness, inside? No, I won’t go in. Do you think they would listen to us just because we tell them? [Phone Talk] They are educated, right? What’s the worst that could happen if they listened a bit to elder’s advice? We only advise them so that they would improve their lives. Why did you kick that flower vessel?[On Tv] Just calm down grandma. They say such things. [Phone Talk] But they never ever think to pay attention to what the elders say because of their experience. What happened? What happened? There is no dead body in the hall. Babu, just close your eyes and recollect everything that happened. What are you looking at? I kicked a flower vase. What? I kicked a flower vase. Babu, Mahesh Babu kicked it. After I spoke to you and put the phone down, I accidentally knocked off the flower vase. If so, where is the flower vase? Well, quite simply, as usual it will not be there. Babu, just admit the truth at least now. You must have dreamt all of this. If I did dream of it, how could that bag of money be real? Oh Damn! Damn! Holy crap! Damn! Yes! Babu… That is what I don’t understand.[Phone Talk] How...? I came from this flat. If you slept in the flat below, How could you come out of this flat? I don’t know. I am sure that I came out of this flat. Let’s go, then. How can we go in if it’s locked? Like this What is it? This is called an all-purpose knife. If we don’t have an opener to open the beer bottle… Just open the door. Okay. Hurry. Hurry. Do you think this is an all-purpose key? all-purpose key knife Get up. Move aside. Not here... Just go and stand there and watch if anyone is coming. Careful with the knife. Is it done? Looks like someone’s heading this way. Hurry up and open it. Hurry... Someone’s coming. They are coming... They are coming. Come in. -Oh, it’s done? Did I not tell you? Didn’t I? Here. There is the dead body. Yes. Yes. You are the only person that I have seen who is happy looking at a dead body. Is he constable Banerjee? He looks like Brahmaji from behind. Don’t touch anything unnecessarily We would leave our finger prints. Two hands? How is it ok if only you wear them? What about us? Don’t you have another pair? Do I look like a salesman? So, who should wear it now? Both of you wear one each. What I mean is… Whose house is this? What business does this constable have here? In the morning, I heard the constable saying he needs to go to Tejaswi’s house for passport verification. This must be the house. How do you think he died? That is not important. The pertinent question is how did he get here. If we take a look at the camera footage, we could find out. Just remember we are here to get your stuff. Hey... Just look around that side I will take this side. What should I see? -Look at his face. Oh my! Mirror. My Image in the mirror. What room is this? Disgusting... It's a bathroom. What happened? Why do you put a face like a scare crow? What happened? There is something here. Dumb fellow! I told you not to touch anything, right? What is all this? I didn’t knock any of this down? The shelf did it. What do you mean the shelf did it? -I am telling you the truth. If you don’t believe me, take a look. Who are you? I am getting scared. I have been hearing those sounds for quite some time now. This is a door? Buddy, let’s get out of here. Why would you go in when I am suggesting that we get out? Stop, buddy. There must be a spirit trapped inside. Let’s get out of here. Shut it! There will always be someone like you in every movie. Open it. What is this? He looks like a nature lover. He is growing plants in his house. Is this rice or not? Don’t meddle. What plant is this? Holy Basil? No. It’s Marijuana. What? Someone has put up a big set up here. My packages. Really? What happened? Rat. Rat. I was scared for nothing... Rat. Our father in heaven. I am in 501. Who followed the heart by the name. Save me superman. Save me. I know Jackie chan. Madam… Madam…. -Who is she? She is Tejaswi. Did the constable come for her? Madam… Madam… -Is she alive or not? Just move. What are you doing? If we do this, she will cough and regain her consciousness. I saw it yesterday in Ftv. Just check her pulse. Ok. What happened? I can’t seem to figure out. -Just move. Is she alive or dead? Is she dead or alive? Is she dead? -Shhh...! She is alive. This seems to be a very big racket. Slowly, we are getting stuck into this mess. Listen to me please. Let’s just go away from here. You mean we should leave her here? The constable there is dead and this girl here looks to be on the way to join him. Do we need to be in this mess? Let’s just get out of here. -Let’s go. That constable who died came for passport verification. And, she is here. Tejaswi’s flat number is 503. This is 501. That means this flat isn’t hers. So, who does this flat belong to? I ordered it a week ago. Ravi, apartment number 501. When will it arrive? This is Ravi’s flat. Everything he only has done. When I saw his face, I suspected him right away. Who is Ravi? He is the one who smoked marijuana with that girl Bujji. If so, why is she here? She must have seen Ravi killing the constable. So, why did he trap you in this mess? When he was smoking up with Bujji, he must have seen him. Ravi must have got him here, to make it look like Babu killed the constable. Ravi thought that he could escape. So, why didn’t he kill her then? He didn’t. As soon as I escaped from here, he must have planned something else. He will definitely return. So, let’s get out of here before he returns. What happened? Water What happened? Who is this? Ravi. Ravi? We thought he would be the one to come here. Before someone else comes here, Let’s get out of here. I am talking to you. Did you find the camera footage? There isn’t a single computer here. To my knowledge, the camera must not have been working. Camera footage isn’t here. And we found our packages. Let’s just get out of here. How can we leave without knowing what went on here? -What will you do even if you figure it out? Buddy, the situation is getting very complicated. We are looking for ways to solve and unwillingly getting ourselves involved further into this mess. This entire set up looks like there is a big gang behind it. Kill two and put the blame on the both of you…. You stay here. If that girl regains her consciousness, find out what happened. You come with me. Where are you guys going? Just stay here. Stay here. Where are you going? To the watchman. -Why? To see the footage. -What footage? When I hid in the bathroom, he fixed a camera in there. Security camera? Who fixes a security camera in the bathroom? It’s a spy camera. Spy camera? For what? To watch that girl Bujji. What would you do looking at the girl? I took the spy camera from the bathroom and put it in my pocket. So, take it out. When I was high, I mistook the spy camera for the phone and took it out. Then, let’s go to the watchman’s room. Show me the footage of the camera that you fixed in Bujji’s bathroom? What camera? What footage? Who is this girl Bujji? What are you doing here since morning? Have you been giving the three deliveries till now? Who is he? He looks like a devil’s child. What are you looking at? And what have you two been doing here since morning? If the camera is there, How can I show the footage here, sir? Isn't that a live video? No, sir. It only works with a memory card, sir. And the memory card needs to be changed every two days. If we need to see the footage, How can we? I will change the memory card the day after tomorrow. You can take it then. Is there no other way? To the outside? You can go from here. Shall I tell her that the plumber is here and then get the memory card? Cute boy. Let’s go. That old lady might recognise you. Why did you come at this time? The shower? -You checked it this morning, right? I got the plumber. Just in case there is a problem. Why is the plumber here at this time? You could have gotten him tomorrow morning, right? Well, he was free so…. Shouldn’t we be free? Dumb girl! What is he saying? We won’t take too long, madam. Alright, fine. Get in. -Ok. Let’s go. Grandma, have you eaten? No dear. I was waiting for you. Ah Grandma, You joke way too much! Really. It’s true. Listen, there are vegetables on the dining table could you please chop them up? Go away. Who are these people? They are plumbers. They are here to repair the shower. Oh..! Where is the room? You? Come here. Me, Grandma? Not you fool! Tell him to come here. She asking you. Just manage is somehow. Come here. -Hello… You… You… You… Oh my god! We’ve been caught. Ah yes! You played the character of the son in the TV serial ‘Oh my son!’ Didn’t you? Thank god! Yes. You are. You are. Why do you keep torturing your wife like that? You Idiot. Ok. It’s done grandma. This is in the shower that is why it wasn’t working. This was in the flower pot that’s why he has been coming. Woman is not a property in the shop. Why should this video ? Just forward it. He put you in the delivery bag and took you upstairs. It’s not a new application. I have already applied. Number? One second Wait a second. I’ll tell you. I tried tracking it online. -Let's go. Just wait. But the server might be down. It’s not coming up. Name? Tejaswi Thota T - E - J - A - S - W - I Tejaswi Thota. Flat number 503 Mansion Heights, Jubilee Hills. The police verification has been carried out this morning. Sir, I need this passport immediately. When will I get it? Please make sure it’s done immediately. Please take a look. Thank you. If he is Tejaswi, who is that girl? Who are you guys? Who are you? Why are you trying to kill me? Why are you trying to kill him? Please don’t hurt him. Let him go. Where is Ravi? Here. Why did you kill him? You killed him and then trying to blame us? What do you mean I killed him? Who are you guys? Why did you tie me up? Speak. I am talking to you. Who are you? Can’t you hear me? I am talking to you! If only I had gone to my village… You freaking faggot! What are you looking at? You filthy scum bag. You bloody... Shut up! I don’t have the patience to persuade you. I am already very irritated. Shut up and only answer my questions. Who killed Ravi and the constable? Who tried to set me up? Who are you? Hey, you! -Buddy Don’t you understand what I am trying to explain? Tell me. Who are you? Tell me… I will tell you… You pathetic fool! -Why do you want to be beaten up? Speak. I will tell you… I will tell you… My name is Myra. And I deal with Meth. I am a drug dealer. A few months ago, I got acquainted with Ravi. He told me that he cooked drugs and that he was looking for a dealer. He gave me a sample. I liked his quality and gave him a small deal. My clients liked his quality too and so I started giving him bigger deals. In the beginning, he was on time with delivery. Later on he began to delay the deliveries. Last month, I finalised a very big deal. He took an advance and assured me that he would deliver the product in fifteen days. But even after a month, he didn’t deliver. And so, I came to meet him this morning. That is when I met you. Hey Myra. How many times do I have to call you? when ever the package is ready I only would have given it to you. It’s not done yet? Just chill man. It’s almost done. Almost? Almost? When did you say that you would deliver? It’s already been delayed by over fifteen days. Just fifteen days, right? Of course, that won’t matter to you. I am your only client. But for me, there are a lot of clients. Don’t start again. Do you want a joint? I want my package. The last batch is being cooked. When it’s done, I’ll only give it to you. I’ll wait. Myra. I told you I will bring it to you. I lost all my faith in you. I will only leave after picking up my package. Just because it got delayed once, do you have to react like this? In the beginning, you always gave on time. What happened to you now? Are you thinking no end of yourself. That’s not the case Myra. I was trying a new drug. That’s the reason why it’s been delayed. Cool. I gave you 80 lakhs and you considering me to be a fool... Is it? When did you give me 80 lakhs? You gave me 30 lakhs only. 50 lakhs, huh? You want your 50 lakhs? I will give you. Wow. Take it. It looks you came here fully prepared. You know what? I am done with you. This is our last deal. Hey! Please. I am sorry, okay? I can’t take another chance with you. I am done. Give me my packages soon and I will leave immediately. I said it’s cooking right? -How long will that take? Ten. Ten hours. Ten hours? Of course, ten hours. Do you think its as easy as cooking rice? Like put it on the stove and take it off in 15 minutes. It’s meth. Do the math. Why would you want try the same old thing? This is my new drug. Wanna give it a go? Up to you. One second. You? What’s your name? -What’s yours? Do you live in this flat? -No. I pitched a tent outside and live there. How long have you been staying here? Why do you want? Have you gone mad? Not really. Do you know who I am? You already told me that you are not an uncle. You are a rascal. You are thinking no end of yourself. Kind of. Police. Oh, it’s an ID. S. Banerjee. Police cons... constable? So, why did you stop only with the word police? You should also mention that you are a constable. Can I come in? Do you have a warrant? For what? -To come inside. I came to the neighbouring flat for passport verification. If you sign as a witness, I will leave immediately. Okay? Give it here. I will sign it. You are going to sign it without knowing any details, is it? You told me just now that you are police constable Banerjee. Not about me. About this file. You told me just now it’s about my neighbours. Alright, fine. Let’s go inside. Let’s go in and talk. -I will sign it here. Move aside. Thank goodness. Sir? Name. Ravi Your full name? -Ravi Teja How long have been living here? -Ever since I bought the flat. From 6 months. What do you do? What will I do? If you leave, I will have my lunch. I am hungry. Do you know Tejaswi? I know, Sir. How do you know that person? Ever since that person moved into the flat beside mine. What else do you know about that person? She is a good person. Whenever we meet she greets me. When I get close, she hugs me. For every festival, she sends me sweet. That is all. Really? What else? If I say anything else, I will be called a pervert, perhaps even a stalker. If you knew that much about that person, didn’t you know that Tejaswi is a boy. Didn’t you say Tejaswi? Yes. Tejaswi Thota. Thota. Male. A guy. Without knowing who Tejaswi is.. Why did you lie that you knew Tejaswi? Well, I just thought it was one harmless signature and told you casually. You seem very twisted. No, sir. I am straight. No other flat here has a camera but your flat has one. Why? I put it up. -Why? Security. -Do you need that much security? Well, I like horror movies. That’s why I am cautious. That's why. Why are you rubbing your nose continuously? Do you have a cold? Dust allergy. Pollination. Pollution. Let me take a look. Why do you want to look into my nose? Disgusting! What’s that powder? I applied powder to the face. It must have gone into my nose. Do you think that I don’t know the difference between a face powder and the powder you sniff? May be. Is that what you think? -Why do you hit me? Sir! Why is this cocaine here? What does cocaine mean? Don't you know what cocaine means? -It’s a deodorant powder. So why are you putting it in your nose? What is this? Injection, sir. For what? I suffer from Insulin that is why I inject sugar. Do you take me for a fool? -No, sir. How much cocaine do you have? Do you just use it or do you supply it? Sir, what do you mean supply? When I am tensed I just use it sometimes… Take it out… Take it out. Sir, take this and please let me go. -Take it out. What? A hundred? -I only have that much on me. Do you think this is a traffic violation? Take it out... Take the cocaine out. Sir…Please… -Take it out. I only have this much sir. Oh goodness! Who is the supplier? That John fellow. Let’s not discuss all that sir. Let’s get down to business. Take this thousand and leave me alone, please. What will I get with a thousand? Ten beers at least. Do you know how serious this matter is...? What’s that sound? It’s from next door. -Not next door. Next room. Sir… Sir… Are you trying to tell me stories? Sir… Sir… -Someone’s there. Please stop, sir. Please. You are spinning stories. -Take this ten thousand, sir. Sir…Sir… What is this? -I am a book writer. Did you write all this? Sir… -Why is this out? Hey take off your hand -Plywood sir. Plywood. Sir… -What is this door? Sir, just… storage sir. Old stuff and all that. Is it! Let’s go and clean that. -Sir… it’s a bathroom. Water… Oh my god! What is this? -It’s a vegetable... Let’s talk while cutting them. Sir… it’s vegetables, right? So… Please, Sir.. sir... This is urea, sir And that is the soil there. If you plant the seeds in the soil, there you have the sprouts. It’s morning breakfast… gives protein. That's all, Sir. You have such a big drug set up here and you offer me 100 rupees. Sir. I said a hundred first. Right after that, I said ten thousand. This isn’t something that can be solved with thousands. Oh my goodness! You want to do business without informing us. Is this a legal business to inform you and do, Sir. Please tell me how much do you want? Let’s sit down and have a chat. Sir! As soon as I saw you, I had my doubts. You and your attire. How dare you? You dare call me uncle? Sir… I was high. And I didn’t know what I was saying. I am sorry, sir. Who is your dealer? -Some Tom, dick and Harry. Who is it? "Every night in my dreams I see you; I feel you." Who is this? "I feel you…" "Every night in my dreams I see you; I feel you." Who is this? You told me that there was no one here. Is this a side business? Sir… No, sir. She is my friend. You and me are not friends. Shhh..! Friend? Did she come here to give you company? Or did she come from some company? Company? Yes… Infosys. -Tell him to shut up. Being a woman, don’t you have any shame resorting to this sort of work? Sir… Please understand.... No. Myra. Just keep quiet. I am dealing with it, right? Please... I beg you. What did you say? Ten lakhs... Final sir. What ten lakhs? I gave fifty. Myra, just keep quiet. So, is she Myra? Yes. That’s me. Sir. Ten lakh fifty thousand rupees. 10,50,000 rupees. Oh my! I wonder whose face I saw this morning. How is it that I am getting so lucky today? For catching you, I get money. And for catching her, I get a promotion. Sir, just give it a thought once again. Why all this fuss? Give me 30 lakhs. I will let you go. And she will be imprisoned. Hey! What is he talking? -Sir. Please think again. No. Nothing doing. -Please sir. Do you want to take her place instead in the prison? Yeah. Go ahead. Go on. -Sir, please let her go as well. I cannot let her go. Do you know how long we’ve been searching for her? -Please sir...Sir... Freaking girl... How dare you call me like that? [Cursing..] How dare you use cuss words on me? Please sir… Sir… Please sir… Sir…Sir… I am going to kill you. How dare you? How dare you use cuss words on me? You knew that I was a policeman and yet you stabbed me, right? I will see your end. I will show you the power of the police. I will get the entire force with me. How come you stabbed him like that? What else should I do? I was talking to him, right? Did you not hear what he was saying? I was talking to him… How dare he call me names? I was talking to him… How dare he hit me up? I was talking to him… What is that you were talking? What if he goes and tells the entire police department? He is already on his way. Oh, Damn! Sir… Sir… Sir… Sir… What are you doing? Can’t you see? What about him? Why would you ask me that? -What do you mean? You are the one who lives here. The one who cooks the drugs here, is you. If the police come here, You will be the one who will be caught. How can you laugh like that? Please say something, Myra. That is not my problem. If my package is ready. I will take it and leave. You deal with it. It’s none of my concern. You? What are you doing? Tell me, what do you want? You told me that we could smoke some weed. It’s difficult now. Come back later. You say the same thing every time. We have to do it today. I told you we will do it later. -Let’s smoke the weed. Let’s smoke... Let’s smoke... Let’s smoke. Don't you understand when I say it is not possible now. Why can’t we do it now? You already took money. We have to smoke today. Alright fine. I will give you the weed. You smoke it up. I don’t know how to smoke it. Please… If we can’t do it at your place, we will do it in my place. Grandma is asleep. Mad girl. Please go. Will you come with me, or should I come inside? I will come. Wait. Hey Myra… Get up. Get up. Get up. My bad time! I want my package. -Yeah.. yeah...I will give it. You have been repeatedly harassing me over that package. Sit here. Stay. At this point of time I started getting into a trance... At that time someone... Who? If I knew who it was. I would have told you, right? What happened next? After that you guys came. Then, who killed Ravi? I don’t know. She must be the one who killed him. And now, she is playing games. Why will I kill Ravi? Ravi is the only person who witnessed you killing the constable. So, if she kills Ravi as well. She won’t be a suspect anymore. There would be absolutely no proof that she was ever here. Even if I did kill that guy, why would I need to stay here? I would have been long gone. You are here for your drugs. Then, why is this room door locked from the outside? You must have locked it from the outside and must have hid inside. Seriously? -Yes! Of course! We cannot believe her. Please believe me. I really don’t know who killed Ravi. What’s the proof that you are telling us the truth? If you don’t believe, get lost. Look at her. Look. Look at her frustration. I am going to kill her. Hey… Call the police. Call the police. Please.. I told you exactly what happened. I don’t have any problem with you guys. If you let me go, I will take my package and leave. The police will then imprison us instead. Hey! If we can somehow set it up in a way that the constable and Ravi killed each other, we can all escape from this mess. Why are you including us? What is our connection to this crime? If that’s the case, you guys leave, I will take care of the rest. Really? So that you can take the drugs and escape? What the hell is your problem? You don't have a problem for any solution. What do you want me to do? Just confess that you killed both of them and hand yourself over to the police. What do you need? Money? Tell me the amount. I will give it. No matter how much the amount will you give it? In this situation, nothing is more important than my life. Even that? Babu… please. No. Don’t do anything to it. I told you I will give you how much ever you want. Babu… What are you doing? Babu… I am talking to you. Listen to me and call the police. Listen to me. -They will take care of her. Babu… don’t take any hasty decisions. Listen to me. Tell me how much do you want. You tell me. 30 lakhs? No…. Have you gone mad? Why are you hitting him? He is the one responsible for everything. Take a look. Abhi, what is this? What did you think? You never thought that there would be a camera there, right? If we didn’t take the camera out of the bathroom, we would have listened to him and would have been cheated. Abhi… what are you doing here? Not like this... Why did you do it? Tell me. Tell me. Babu… -Tell me. Tell me. Why did you set me up? I will tell you… I didn’t do it on purpose. Because of the situation I had to do like that. What is your connection with Ravi? I'll tell. I'll tell. Six months ago, Ravi and I started this business. To ensure that people don’t get suspicious, we took a flat in this housing colony. Cooking drugs was my job. Selling them was Ravi’s. I don’t know anything about the dealer. That’s why I don’t know about Myra and neither does she know about me. Just like every other day, I came to this flat…. I saw Myra. And then, I called Ravi. What’s happening? Where did you go? I went to the flat downstairs. Why? To smoke weed. How could you with a dead body here? Who is he? Ravi told me everything that happened. So, that’s our dealer Myra? Yes... What did you do to her? I didn’t know who she was so, I hit her hard on the head. Oh.. Damn! She is not dead. I told you to give her package last week itself, right? The thing is…. -What happened? There was another party that wanted it. So, I gave it to them. Are you mad? When you gave deadline to her, why did you sell it to someone else? They offered to pay twice the amount. That’s why. That is the reason why I ask you to get involved with the dealing side of the business. You won't... what could I do? We set all of it up really well. Now we have to start from scratch. What shall we do now? The one who is dead is a constable. That too someone who came here for verification. They will definitely come here searching for him. What do we do now? What if we dispose of the body? What flat did you come from? 401. Did you find anyone there? -There… there was someone sleeping in the bedroom. Is it him? Yeah. He looks a little like him. Alright, let’s go. -Where? What are you doing? I am trying to set it up in such a way that it looks like this guy murdered him. What for? An old lady died because of him. If we can set it up in a way that looks like he killed the constable... the police would conclude that he came for a delivery, tried to rob the place and killed the constable. What are you doing? Destroying the CCTV footage. Why? Because Myra killed the constable, she cannot deal with us. She also gave us the 50 lakhs. Let’s take it and get out. Let’s also take the drugs that we cooked for her. What will we do with them? If we sell them outside, we could get 2 crores. We can then set up things again somewhere else. What should we do with this set up? We should clean it up. -Do you think it’s that easy? However much we clean this, it’s not hard to figure out that it was for cooking drugs. If that’s the case, it would be better if we run away from here. We don’t have a lot of time. We have a maximum of a day. The police are sure to come searching for the constable here. It looks like a decent idea but everyone knows that I live in this flat. If there is a delivery boy or a constable in here it would mean that I opened the door. Even if we escape anywhere, they will track me. We will then have murder as well as drug charges on us. What now? Do you need some water? One second. Hey… Hey… No one but us knows that we are working alongside each other. So, if you die, the drug charge will be on you as well. As to the charge of the murder of the policeman here, they will conclude as per their imagination. That gap is enough... I will escape in that confusion. I wanted to leave with the drugs and the money. But when you escaped, my plan got disturbed. I thought you would be at home and so, I came home. I found out that you have the money. But I didn’t want to share that money with you guys. That’s why I wanted to bring it back to the flat. You said that you would go to the police. But I got lucky when the mobile I placed in the bag rang. And when you got to know that dead person is the constable... You suggested that we go to the flat, Then my job became easier. Because I had Ravi’s car with me, it was easy at the entrance... The watchman did not stop us. When we reached 401, I knew for sure that you would have figured out that you didn’t come out of that flat. That is exactly what happened. But I never expected the old woman to be alive. And then, you figured out this flat. With the key I had, I opened this door. I thought you would leave after you found your packages. (My packages) But you got busy solving the murder. (How will we leave if we don’t know what happened here?) At that time, I tried really hard to divert you. (Let’s go.) (It looks like there is a big gang behind this set up) -Let's leave from here. But you didn't listen. And then you found her and immediately you found him. Because Myra didn’t know who I was. I wanted to frame her… [Cursing] I thought I could escape. But… that video… Buddy, nothing was pre planned. I went with the flow. I got swept away in the situation. We lived together, roamed together... How could you think of cheating us? Just because we ate and spent time together would you follow me to the prison. No, right? I didn’t do all this to cheat anyone. I did this to protect myself. If you were in my place, you would have done the same. How dare you compare us with you? Shut up! You thief! How dare you call me a thief? -What else would you call a person who robs? How many times do I have to tell you? That’s not robbery. That’s called pocketing money. Shut up! You are just reasoning it all up to make yourself feel better. If what you did was not wrong, neither what I did was wrong. How can you talk like that? After having done all this? Don’t you feel ashamed? When you are not ashamed, why would I be? You tried to escape when you were under the assumption that that old woman died. I did the same thing. That was an accident. This is deliberate. Even then, I wanted to go to the police station when I realised my mistake. But did you go? You were scared and so you dismissed that idea. I did the same thing because I was scared. You mean to say that you would do anything to save yourself? Even frame us? He doesn’t know the value of friendship. Oh really? Such great friends, huh? I just lived with you guys in that dingy place just to save some money. Do you think people become friends because they stay in the same house? They become friends only when they get to know each other. I knew about your problems only today. We knew about your drugs today as well. Otherwise, you mean to say we should pocket money like you? This is all a product of my wisdom and hard work. For whom? Huh? Who will benefit from this? Who benefits from a cigarette? But they still manufacture it. And people still smoke it. This is the same thing. So, are you suggesting that every one takes drugs and get high? I am not forcing anybody to take it. And I am not selling it door to door. It’s because there is a demand, I supply it. Why are you still talking to him? Just call the police. And then? Get me arrested, is it? Do you think you will safe after they arrest me? Do you think the police will believe you if you say you knew nothing about it? Then, I will tell them that the three of us are in this together and I will make them believe it. You... You will burn in hell. You have no other choice but to do as I tell you. Let bygones be bygones. Listen to me at least now... Let’s take the drugs and money, frame her and we can all get out of this mess. I made one mistake because I listened to him. I will not make another mistake listening to you. This is the reason why you did all this, right? What will you do if this doesn’t exist? Babu, have you gone mad? Damn! Damn! I'll kill you. Hey, leave me. Move a side. Babu.. my neck...no. Leave me. Tie him up. Leave me. Tie him up. Babu, listen to me. I'll kill you. [Chaos] Hey... I thought the white powder In our kitchen was salt all these days. I got it now that is a drug. Hey, that is not the drug That is salt. Hey, Dasu you go away. Where will you run away? Leave me. Please answer my questions with a Yes or a No only. What is your name? Yes… Su... Yesu. Babu. Do you know Abhi? No. -Yes. Do you know that Abhi makes drugs? Yes. -No. Sir, it’s a bit confusing to answer your questions this way. We will tell you everything in detail. That is what happened. What is this? There is a camera fixed in every room of that house. Did you fix it? Ravi did. Abhi didn’t know that? I don’t know about that. Why? Didn’t you interrogate him yet? We cannot. Why? Because of drug overdose. Recovery…. What about Myra… Recovery… Damn! Does that mean only the both of us recovered? How? It’s a medical miracle. To know that we recovered so quickly. Wow... what a great body mine is. How long ago do you think your incident happened? Four days? Four weeks. This is 2016, right? When you already know everything that has happened, Then, why are you interrogating us, sir? Just testing to see if you are telling the truth or not. Sir, we did tell you, didn’t we? Can we leave? No.... There is another question for you. Tell me... where is the money? What Money? That day we put the money in the bag and bring it. Just check it, sir. The bag is still there. But there are only 5 lakhs in it. What do you mean? I opened the bag and saw the money myself. There is money on the top but it’s all newspapers underneath. What did you do? I told you to get all the money that day. Hey... You have two options. The first one... keep the money with you and go to the jail as criminals. Two... give the money to me and walk away from this freely. Choice is yours. How can you imprison us with so much evidence in against the others? Do you know that there is an option called delete in it. I put only 5 lakhs in the bag that day. Take the twenty-five lakhs and let us go, sir. What do you mean? If there are only 5 lakhs in the bag... there must be a total of 45 lakhs. How would you come up with a figure of 25 lakhs? I remember now sir. I forgot it because I was high. It is in the attic in my house. That’s good. We found the bag, Sir. There is money in this bag... what about my share? Ok... ok. What will you do with us now? All of you are aware of the incident that occurred at Mansion Heights. The interrogation for the case is finished today. Based on the information provided by two of our informers who have just recovered... we have concluded that Abhi and Myra are the culprits... and we will be submitting the report for the same. We have found the diary of the primary suspect Myra. The diary contains the names of business tycoons, Film celebrities and even politicians. I promise that I will ensure each and everyone named in this diary will be brought to face the law. If he took so much money from us, I wonder how much he would take from them. Let it go, buddy. At least, because of us the drug racket got exposed. I never thought Abhi would do this. I never thought you robbed people either. I never thought even you would listen to me and rob people. Anyways, it’s called pocketing the money. What did you understand from this? Leave English serials Telugu serials are the way forward. Let’s watch it. Please sir. Nothing will happen to her. Let me give you the first aid. [On TV] No… I don’t want it. [On TV] Ratna…Ratna… Doctor… please tell me that nothing happened to my Ratna… What happened to Ratna? How will I know? Due to severe injuries, her cerebellum was damaged. She got a hole in heart also. I am sorry. These doctors are always like this. Why are you so sad? It isn’t a big deal. I am going to die in your arms as a married woman. What could be greater than that? Please don’t say that Ratna. Ratna…. No. Ratna Madam... From today onwards Rs 500 and Rs.1000 notes are not valid. Ok.. Start Music...
