Welcome ladies and gentlemen, boy and girls, and all residents of the Planet Earth. This year, the chimpanzees have joined the space cadets and will attempt their first launching into space. Yesterday, Frank Church, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence said the White House is holding up the investigation of the CIA, by not providing requested documents in an alleged CIA plot against Fidel Castro. There are those who will disbelieve what I'm about to say. - When I first came here, the first people they sent up to see us, you see, were operational type people from the CIA with some rather wild ideas. In the CIA documents we have examined, it says that the project that was named down here, they intended to use everything learned about the new agents to induce them to, quote, to perform acts of a complex, purposeful nature. Yeah, but that was never done. The effects of which may be out keeping with the individual's. - That sort of thing. Interest to his being, contrary. Intentions and interest contrary to the individual subversive to goals which he. - Yeah, I understand all this talk, but the situation was, you see, those things were never done. Because of wise people on both sides. We weren't able to do this, nor interested in it. They were though. - Some of the low level people were, but the high level people were not, tell you the truth. And now ladies and gentlemen on all continents, the grand finale. The speediest performing monkey in all the world. The acrobat of acrobats. Alley-oop. This exceptionally cool monkey is known by the name of Chop Chop Chang. - Everyone, everyone loved Chop Chop Chang, and for good reason. These circus tricks require a high level of ability to perform that not just any monkey could do. Chop Chop Chang made it look easy. I think he was up to something like a chimpanzee riding a bicycle. Not only was it very impressive to watch, it's also very, very funny. You couldn't find a single person alive on the planet who didn't like that chimp. - I love him, I don't care what anybody thinks about him, I'll always love, even when I'm 105 years old, but I'll love him. Please touch the window so I can just see you. I saw you smoking before, and I just wanted to but I love you and I want you. - Have you ever been this crazy about any other entertainer? - No, and that's what's so amazing. We don't know why we're like this. Five, four, three, two, one, fire. - You just immediately fell in love with him. He had such a sweet disposition, he was just a. - I guess we got a chimpanzee flying in space. Took off at 10:08, he reports that everything is perfect and working well. The world's most famous and successful chimpanzee, before his death in March of 1986, would be linked to over 18 assassinations, 20 unsolved murders, plus covert military operations. All the files highly submitted, highly classified United States CIA program Operation Chimp. The purpose of it was to transfer on the common party. - The CIA has repeatedly denied these allegations and refuses to acknowledge the existence of said program. - We are not professing to tell you the complete story of these activities. We are professing to tell you the complete story that we know. But these records don't tell the story, they tell pieces of it. However, to many conspiracy theorists, the story of Chop Chop Chang uncovered evidence to the contrary. - In 1952, Chop Chop Chang, the world famous chimpanzee, known and beloved all over the planet suddenly disappears. The greatest manhunt in history as agents from the FBI, coast guard, highway patrol, sheriff deputies and local police join in the search. - From 1962 onward, there would be no more Chop Chop Chang movies or TV shows. America was devastated. - I don't have the words to express how I feel. - As a police official, what do you think happened? - There's too much to speculate on. I believe it was just too early, perhaps in the next 24, 48 hours. - Is it conceivable that he was kidnapped for ransom or that he deliberately dropped out of sight? Is it possible that the CIA successfully commissioned a trained circus chimpanzee into an unstoppable, mindless killing machine as a lot of conspiracy theorists believe? - Chop Chop Chang's disappearance is highly debatable. Very controversial amongst monkey historians. Chimps matching his description had been reported in Vietnam, Russia, Cuba, China, Germany, and South America. These claims remain as unsubstantiated as those of Elvis, Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. - On the one hand, you have this Operation Chimp conspiracy theory right out of the Manchurian Candidate or the 2006 classic film Primate. And then on the other hand, you have to consider that maybe he's just a chimp and he died. It's a stupid fucking theory. The CIA isn't training a chimp to be a hit man. It's a stupid and childish thing to believe. It's frivolous, it's frivolous and unreal, so. This would prove to be his final public appearance. Shortly after, Chop Chop Chang would disappear overnight with no known explanation fueling conspiracy theorists around the globe for decades to come. - This is a story that has been told in bits and pieces. This is an attempt to pull most of it together. We know we don't have the whole story, we do however have some striking new revelations and insights. The story begins here, just off the nation's front yard, The Mall. The buildings behind me were the headquarters for the World War II office of strategic service. It was here that the first haunting steps toward mind control began. Some of those engaged in that search have agreed to talk about it for the first time. - I worked on Operation Chimp and personally oversaw the actual training of Chop Chop Chang. That I've decided to come forward with my story. The story begins in the jungles of Africa somewhere between Cameroon and the Congo. A baby chimpanzee is born, the third child to a ten year old mother, he is the runt of the family but has a very sweet disposition. Growing up in the tough African jungle would not have been easy for the youngster, who is small and frail compared to other chimps. He is often bullied and ostracized by the younger members of his troop, including his own mother and brothers. At only a few months old, the baby chimp leaves his troop and sets off by himself into the jungle. This would prove disastrous for the child who is almost immediately captured by animal trappers and shipped halfway across the world, to the United States of America. President Truman's dramatic announcement that Russia has created an atomic explosion sends reporters racing for Flushing Meadow when Russia's Rucinski arrives to address the United Nations. The Cold War, especially the trial of Joseph Cardinal Mindszenty, who was forced to testify in a Hungarian court that he was a spy and then lingered the Korean War with the coerced and mainly foggiest impressions of American servicemen. This would spark intense interest in intelligence circles about brainwashing. - In one year alone, more than 2,000 Communist agents were caught in West Germany. Today, all over the world, there are thousands of Soviet intelligence agents with money to burn, looking for unsuspecting targets of exploitation among members of our forces. In fact, everyone in uniform could be a target of opportunity for exploitation if he is vulnerable. The CIA secretly commissioned a study of Communist brainwashing methods in the Cornell University Medical Center. While the purpose of this study was to find out about Communist brainwashing techniques, CIA documents show that the agency was interested in developing mind control methods of its own. - Soon you'll be like a child, or like all the others. Historians say that the creation of a Manchurian Candidate for mind control under extreme conditioning techniques was a major goal of several CIA projects as far back as the 1940's. But documents clearly show that the CIA was attempting to develop agents over whom they had as much control as possible, agents who would perform tasks contrary to their own good. - Normally conditioned American, who's been trained to kill and have no memory having killed. The brain has not only been washed, as they say, but been scrubbed clean. The shaper and molder of OSS is General Wild Bill Donovan. He said of his groups work, we may have made mistakes but we were not afraid to try things that have never been done before. He later wrote of his OSS job that it was, quote, to stimulate the bad boy under the surface of every American scientist and to say to them, throw all of your normal, law-abiding concepts out the window. Here's a chance to raise merry hell. It was under this atmosphere that the search for mind control began. The decision was made at the highest levels of the CIA to test on the most unwitting Americans. As one CIA document says, such testing would be operationally realistic. This bizarre man would be an active participant in that search over the next two decades. - I remember it like it was yesterday. There is evidence to suggest the program had been established as early as the 1940's, perhaps in connection to Operation Paperclip. The CIA's interest in LSD was intense. The worry was that the Russians would get hold of it. Were the Soviets into LSD? - I don't even have to say, I'm sure they were. These are various progress reports written by Doctor Monroe and recently obtained by ABC News. In one of the progress reports, a report of a woman who had electrodes implanted in the brain and was then given LSD and other drugs. Was this patient aware that she was being given LSD? - I don't think that they would've even known what LSD was at the time. By far the most chilling experiments we have uncovered took place at this Gothic estate called Ravenscrag. It was here that the CIA funded a series of experiments, severe experiments. This man worked on some of these programs. He described it as breaking up the existing patterns of behavior by means of intensive electroshock therapy with long periods of sleep. Cameron used this combined sleep electroshock treatment on patients as long as 30 days. One patient he kept asleep for 65 days. He would write of his work, it was fun, fun, fun. - Now to a layman, it would appear that Doctor Cameron was trying to take the slate and wipe it clean, the slate being the mind, in other words, brainwashed. The Manchurian Candidate, controlled by others, to do things against his will, is it possible?. Upon his arrival to the United States, historical records indicate the chimp was purchased by the Calloway Circus, a small group of traveling circus performers and he moved down to Alabama. - Step this way to see this from the four corners of the world, what you need is one dime. The circus was owned and operated by Mister Robert J. Calloway, a circus strongman who quickly became fond of the young chimp and gave him the name Chop Chop Chang. - He was such a cute little guy with such a sweet disposition. Chop Chop Chang was a natural. He quickly mastered advanced acrobatics and complicated routines. - In just a few short years, Chop Chop Chang became the headlining attraction for Calloway Circus. He sold out show after show to become celebrated as the most talented circus performer in all of the US. Robert Calloway was a well known gambler with life long connections with organized crime. He got his start a few years before during prohibition. When the traveling circus was founded as a front to transport large barrels of alcohol from town to town through the south. The details of his death are unknown. It was later discovered that the Calloway Circus had operated as a front to launder money for local bookies and that Calloway had a long history of unpaid gambling debts. The circus closed shortly after Calloway's death and the now famous Chop Chop Chang was sold to a man named Rockford Swope, a film producer in Hollywood, California. Is human behavior predictable? Could the mind be controlled? Perhaps not. - Hold on, give me a minute, forgive me. - Sorry, give me a minute. Forgive me. - When the red light flashes, fire the vehicle and this will be protocol. - No problem, director. Whoever you are, you're too late. You'll never stop my evil plan to blow up this mountain. One press of a button and the whole thing goes boom. - I thought the same thing, but then it hit me, you can't blow up Mount Everest, if I do it first! No! So in the end it was decided that a Manchurian Candidate was not feasible but the search for mind control continues. - A chimpanzee army following is fast becoming the world's largest. With these assets, it seems logical that we should specialize in the study of high risk, operational situations prior to exposing man. In this area, the CIA did make a significant breakthrough. Neuro physicist Doctor Jose Delgado was financed by the office of naval research. In this experiment, the bull is sedated. Electrodes are implanted in its brain. Delgado transmits an electronic impulse to the center of the bull's brain. Delgado has remote control of the animal. Recently released CIA documents refer to the feasibility of the remote control of animals. - Animal surrogates would be used to obtain data that would be meaningful in evaluating the danger command. And in addition, a chimpanzee filing was a resource of great value and medical research. Accordingly, we launched a program of experimental medical and included a comprehensive study of hetero transplantation of simian and human electrodes. Other areas were examined through the 60's and 70's. Brain surgery, psycho surgery, creation of amnesia, parapsychology, manipulation of genes. - Detailed study of the functions of the primate brain is now underway. Hollywood in the 1950's was a booming town for animal actors. Work was everywhere for monkeys, dogs, cats, roaches, animals. Chop Chop Chang became one of the most recognizable chimps in the industry, appearing in the most television programs and motion pictures during his time in California. - In looking at the film and television work of Chop Chop Chang, undeniable that he was one of if not the greatest contributor to the history of chimpanzee cinema. There was simply no one else like him. Chang fever gripped the nation. - He was like the Beatles before there even were the Beatles. Chop Chop Chang cartoons, Chop Chop Chang t-shirts, Chop Chop Chang lunch boxes, Chop Chop Chang cereal, it was Chang mania. - Alright, alright, come on, no smoking! - I've dedicated my life to furthering the history of monkeys and apes in film and television. There's classic films like Congo, MVP, Most Valuable Primate, MVP Two, Most Vertical Primate. His films are my passion, they're my life's work. I'm sorry, I have no clue. I don't know, I really don't know. I don't know about planets, I'm not an astronomy professor, I'm a professor of apes in film and television, so I don't know the movie. I don't know it. - He changed chimpanzee film forever. Right up there with the great apes of modern cinema, King Kong, Donkey Kong, Gorilla Graw, these are titans of the field and he stood among them. His handler Rockford Swope, however, was not as lucky. Having been forced into migrant work during the Great Depression, Swope spent a brief period of his youth as a Communist sympathizer. Calling the House on American Activities committee to order, chairman Jay Parnell Thomas of New Jersey opens an inquiry into possible Communist penetration of the Hollywood film industry. The committee is looking to determine if red party members have reached the screen with the purpose of propaganda. - There has been a small group of the Screen Actors Guild who oppose the policy of the Guild officers or the Guild as shown by evidence on various issues. That's a small break that's been referred to as more or less following the tactics of the Soviets with the Communist Party. - If I had my way about it, they'd all be sent back to Russia or some other unpleasant place. - Are you or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? - I believe I have the right to be confronted with any evidence to support this question. I should like to see what you have. Oh, well you would? Yes. Well you will pretty soon. He was blacklisted from Hollywood in 1957 and never worked again until his death less than a decade later. Broke and bitter, Swope was forced to sell Chop Chop Chang to the United States Air Force. He was shipped off to a military base in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The details surrounding the origins of Operation Chimp are unclear. It is known that several CIA projects of the 1960's had experimented with chimpanzee and other animal intelligence in a CIA facility outside of Denver, Colorado. - Oh, forgive me. It was only the start of the space race between the United States and Russia. The US had long been using animals to test their rockets. Today a new movement in the sky, a 23 inch metal sphere placed in orbit by a Russian rocket, one of the great scientific feats of the age. - In a masterpiece of propaganda, the Soviet Union announced they had launched Sputnik number two, carrying a live dog, this is reportedly history's first space animal. Yet behind the scientific event, lies a great military warning. Confirmed now by Anglo American scientists, the rocket that launched Sputnik number two is capable of carrying a ton and a half hydrogen bomb warhead more than 5,000 miles to a target. Chop Chop Chang had been purchased by the Air Force along with 40 other highly trained chimpanzees, all of whom would undergo thorough and intense astronaut training before being shot into space. Three, two, one, fire. The saga of Ham, trailblazer in space is a story of a chimpanzee serving the cause of life. Ham is but one of several chimps to undergo pre flight training. Each is outfitted from head to toe in his own space suit as he awaits the big day. On a whirlwind tour of Florida, President Kennedy visits Cape Canaveral for a first hand look at the mighty Saturn One missile, which will carry a 19,000 pound payload into space next month, a payload larger than any the Russians have launched. At takeoff, it will have a thrust of a million and a half pounds, again, far ahead of Russian achievement. Chop Chop Chang was exceptional. He outperformed his peers on every test and examination, and was selected to be a part of the launch. At last, early in 1961, the preflight preparations are complete. At Cape Canaveral, the blue gray space capsule is ready to take its place atop the launching block. And then to the launching pad comes the chimpanzee. Minutes felt like hours as the countdown was started. Only the star of the space drama seemed unconcerned at the mounting tension around him as he arrives in typical high spirits for his flight checkup. The entire world would watch with baited breath as the chimp was rocketed out of the Earth's orbit. The Air Force had decided not to release the chimps name to the public for fear of negative backlash in the likely event that Chop Chop Chang burned to death live on television. The rocket landed successfully in the Atlantic, making Chop Chop Chang the first monkey in space and a national hero. - Dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks could've made clear to us all as did the Sputnik in 1957, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere, who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take. We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Seven, six, five, four. - In 1961, Chop Chop Chang became a household name. He captured the hearts of not only the American people, but the entire planet. Leave it to President John F. Kennedy to invite Chop Chop to the White House to get a private, non-sexual performance. But regardless of how popular he became, the world famous chimpanzee was still the property of the United States government. That ensures West Berlin communication with the non-Communist world. Another former CIA agent says that Fidel Castro at one time was considered a possible target for a Manchurian candidate. - Castro was naturally our discussion point. Could you get somebody gung ho enough that they would go in and get him? But if you have 100% control of the guy you have 100% dependency. If something happens and you haven't programmed it in you've got a problem. - It's not safe for me to talk like this, even now. It's too dangerous. I was an investigative journalist at one of the top newspapers and media outlets in the country. It wasn't till I started snooping around and asking too many questions about Operation Chimp. It's clear to me now that someone didn't want me to uncover the truth behind the program. Somebody with power. I wouldn't give up my investigation without a fight. John Marks has filed numerous Freedom of Information suits against the CIA and had unearthed much new material. He is the author of The Search for the Manchurian Candidate, a history of intelligence agency work with mind control. He is a consultant for this report. Over the next decade there is little to no record of the life of the world famous chimpanzee. There are no public or television appearances, nor any form of documentation regarding his whereabouts. To the rest of the nation, it appeared as though the beloved monkey had simply vanished. It is during this period that many believe Chop Chop Chang was the primary subject of the operation. - Ladies and gentlemen, we've just received word that Chop Chop Chang, the world famous chimpanzee, has mysteriously vanished. Riots have broken out across American cities. Chop Chop Chang, if you're listening, we love you. - It was obvious that there was much, much more to Chop Chop Chang's disappearance than the government would have you believe. I began an undercover investigation to tell us about this chimp, one of 14. This investigation would consume me for several years. I was obsessed, but I didn't care who I was gonna piss off to determine the uncovered truth. The more I uncovered, the more I researched, the more pulled back into the story to make it perfect. Throughout my investigation, I watched friends, family members, people tell me I'm crazy, that I should stick my tin foil hat in the microwave, but I refuse to give up, no matter how dangerous it gets and besides, you can't microwave tin foil. Trust me, I've seen a lot of hot tin foil. - It all started one day in the early summer of 1962. In the fall of 1962, orders were given to Cape Canaveral for Chop Chop Chang to be transferred to a CIA facility outside of Denver, Colorado. - You go through a year of searching but I finally found someone willing to fund my investigation. A small organization out of Atlanta, Georgia called Arby's Incorporated. That's right, yeah, they agreed to fund my research and in exchange, I agreed to wear an Arby's uniform and take customers' orders in their restaurant for about 25 hours a week. Well that's what they wanted it to look like, see, they couldn't have the government knowing they were funding my research. Seven point five an hour. There's almost no evidence or information about Operation Chimp available, like they helped the job, covering their tracks, destroying all the evidence. However a quick scan of the Chop Chop Chang Wikipedia page left me so shocked I actually knocked my Macbook Pro off my desk and onto the floor. - Ah, shit. I asked Mister Johnson then whether he was satisfied there was no international conspiracy. Throughout the late 1960's and 1970's there are countless unconfirmed sightings of Chop Chop Chang all over the world. - Good evening, the bad news on an assassination plot was reported today by the Senate intelligence committee. The committee issued a report that said officials of the United States government initiated plots to kill two foreign leaders were involved in a plot to kill two others and that the CIA was aware of two more. South Vietnam, focal point of the west's fight against Communism is southeast Asia. For nearly a decade, Premier Ngo Dinh Diem ruled his small nation of 15 million without open opposition. But in mid 1963, protests begin mounting against his regime. His powerful brother Ngo Dinh Nhu, who headed the feared secret police then joins Diem in decisions that alienated both the Vietnamese and the west. He went too far. In a French coup, they took to the streets of Saigon, overwhelmed royalist forces and seized key buildings. New leaders, General Tran Van Minh Nguyen Ngoc Tho promised free elections and stepped up the fight against Communism. To give this guy some of the recent public accounts of CIA activities and we keep hearing stories the CIA has undertaken certain independent operations and other elements of the American justice department. - They made a big mistake since we all knew on different occasions they had many successes. The chimp may go on heroine, but it's my opinion in this case it's fair that we'll charge them as they had been charged, I think they did a good job. Good evening my fellow citizens. This government has promised to maintain the closest surveillance of the Soviet military build up on the island of Cuba. - Tonight we ought to be going to Cuba. Cuba lies just off the coast of Florida. Just 30 days ago, Fidel Castro in Havana was greeted by a cheering mob as one of the greatest heroes in Cuban history. Fidel Castro at the age of 32, now having in hand a great deal of power and a great deal of responsibility. - There will not be under any conditions be an event in Cuba by the United States armed forces. The government will do everything possible to ensure there are no Americans involved in the actions inside Cuba. There are hundreds of reports, documents, photos and eyewitness testimonies connecting Chop Chop Chang to various assassinations and covert missions on behalf of the United States government. Some are more credible than others, while others have been proven to be outright fakes. In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade through downtown Dallas. The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded. There is, however, substantial evidence to his involvement with the assassination of Ruben Cuoadra, a Nicaraguan extremist and Communist leader as reported by a Nicaraguan newspaper that followed him. Several eyewitnesses reported a chimpanzee matching Chop Chop Chang's description smoking a cigarette and holding an automatic assault rifle. These photos, taken the same day as the assassination appear to support eyewitness accounts of a heavily armed chimpanzee. - The photographic evidence is indisputable. Cuba in 1964, also in 1975. December to November 22nd, 1963, Dallas, Texas, the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. That same day a lone chimpanzee was photographed just miles away from the grassy knoll wearing a pair of sunglasses and smoking a cigarette. Here he is again in 1968, Los Angeles, California, killing Robert Kennedy. I suspect the CIA has been tracking me. They're afraid of my research. I've started to take precautions in case of CIA retribution, warning my mother as well as several others who are terrified now that any day it could happen. They're gonna take full advantage of it. Even though my research funding was recently cut short, because I was caught stealing roast beef, I refuse to give up my investigation no matter how dangerous it gets. I know I've stumbled onto something big. Iran Contra and Roswell level big. I hope Chop Chop Chang will find the truth. An intelligence committee said today that the CIA illegally opened a red play. As a petitioner obligation to examine the NSA, in light of its tremendous potential, for the Americans. - They were harassed, they were discredited and at times, endangered. - Faceman, Bosco, Bernard, Little John, and Me. Faceman, Bosco, Little John. Millions of dollars would be spent on LSD research at universities throughout the country and word would begin to spread on campus about this so-called mind blowing drug. And suddenly, it was the counterculture of the 60's. - I give the CIA a total credit for sponsoring and initiating the entire consciousness movement and counterculture events of the 1960's. Doctor Timothy Leary, the 1960's Johnny Appleseed of LSD. The CIA funded and supported and encouraged hundreds of young psychiatrists to experiment with this drug, the fallout from that was the young psychologists began taking it themselves, discovering that it was an intelligence enhancing consciousness raising experience. History will judge the role of the CIA and other intelligence agencies in unwittingly contributing to the counterculture of the 60's with their intense interest in LSD and other hallucinogenics. - Of course Hollywood tried to fill the monkey sized hole he left with other copycats but they just simply weren't the same. There were Black Panthers, Hells Angels, Communists. The CIA was not the only government agency interested in the possibilities LSD and other drugs presented for mind control. The Army chemical corps first started working with the CIA and then branched out on its own. It too tested drugs on unwitting victims, and as their predecessors had a decade earlier turned to General Wild Bill Donovan for help. He was the ideal choice for what the Army had in mind. As this 1952 CIA memo says, the goal will remain the same. The aim is controlling an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and that special investigations will be conducted toward the application of selected elements of these techniques to man. Experiments continued on mental patients throughout the country, even though past and present CIA officials have indicated this kind of work ended in the 60's. - There must be a mole in the CIA. Someone at the highest levels of government and to be safe. - I want to say this to the television audience. I made my mistakes, but in all of my years of public life, I have never profited. Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal caused a government wide panic. - In all my years of public life, I have never obstructed justice. I reached this kind of determination because have gotta know whether their President is a crook. Well I am not. And what I saw, I'll never forget. We're seeing today the dark side of those actions. There are many Americans who would not even suspect a crime. We're not in his pocketbook. - Yesterday, Frank Church, chairman of the Senate elect committee on intelligence, said the White House is holding up the investigation of the CIA by not providing requested documents. It is likely that at the very moment President Kennedy was shot, a CIA officer was meeting with a Cuban agent in Paris and giving him an assassination device to use against Castro. - I was confused. That summer sure was a hot one. More than 5,000 well laundered and sometimes lurid documents were released today by the CIA as agency director Stansfield Turner outlined parts of the CIA's 144 human behavior console projects before a joint Senate committee. - The chief of the CIA told the Senate today that 80 institutions such as colleges, business and hospitals were used in top secret mind control during the Cold War years. - It is totally foreign to me to think about using a human being as a guinea pig and in any way jeopardizing his life and his health but I can assure you that this is totally beyond the pale of my operations and activities in the CIA or any other of our intelligence agencies would undertake. Turner's testimony today revealed that the CIA secretly funneled money through scores of research foundations, colleges, hospitals and clinics here in Washington. I hear there was an arrangement made with the CIA or some other agency to do something that was never done and it never did come to pass, we don't know. Elvis Presley died today. He was 42. The doctor pronounced him dead at three o'clock this afternoon. What arose when you took part in these programs? In 1977, a Senate subcommittee heard testimony from many of them. But the testimony was not that revealing. According to one of them, they agreed amongst themselves to keep the inquiry within bounds that would satisfy the committee. Former narcotics officer Charles Siragusa says that he was asked to limit his testimony by the man he reported to at the CIA. - He wanted me not to say anything. To purger yourself? That's right. Well either that, I'd have to purger myself or take the fifth amendment. And I'm not about to take the fifth amendment for anybody. Former CIA chemist Robert Lashbrook testified he had no first hand knowledge of the agency run safe houses, when in fact he supervised one of them and according to George White's diaries was at a safe house when White conducted what he called an LSD surprise experiment. Doctor Guthlie also testified before the Senate subcommittee, but from an anteroom where he could not be filmed because of what his lawyer termed health and cardiac problems. - In that memorandum that the sheriff is pointing to that memorandum said if he returns, that's you'd go to see Mister Gray, is that correct? - If that's what the memorandum said, Senator. - Thank you, Mister Chairman. CIA director Richard Helms ordered all files from Operation Chimp to be destroyed. Pursuant to this order, almost the entirety of all CIA documents regarding the project have been lost, making a full investigation of the operation impossible. - The need for a secret budget reflects the widespread conviction on the part of intelligence professionals grounded in their intelligence experience that public revelation of vast espionage techniques would inevitably hurt our intelligence efforts. A trendline would be established and a not so hypothetical intelligence analyst in another country would have something to work with. Doctor Sidney Gutley, who we recently filmed near his California home oversaw many of the CIA behavioral programs. He retired in 1973 and destroyed the records of his work. In a valedictory letter, Doctor Gutley wrote that he and his colleges have been able to maintain contact with the leading edge of developments in the field of biological and chemical control of human behavior. Doctor Gutley declined ABC News' request for an interview. He would retire here to Stinson Beach, California and shortly before his death, he wrote to his boss at the CIA, Doctor Sidney Gutley, and summed up his career by saying it was fun, fun, fun. Where else could a red blooded American boy lie, kill and cheat, steal, deceive, rape and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the all highest. The music, the drugs, the free love, we had so much to protest against. - Has mind control been achieved? From all of the available evidence, it appears doubtfully. The human will has prevailed up to this point, but as we have seen, work is continuing in this field. Work that we still don't know very much about. How deeply are the Russians and other dictatorships into all of this? We really can't say and the CIA is reluctant to give out information about it. But the basic question remains, what place does all of this have within a democracy? - Mister Gorbachev, tear down this wall. My fellow Americans, I've said on several occasions that I wouldn't comment on the recent Congressional hearings on the Iran Contra matter until the hearings were over. I know you have doubts in your own mind about what happened in this whole episode. What I hope is not in doubt however, is my commitment to the investigation themselves. - The CIA knowingly and intentionally did what amounts to pump crack cocaine into Los Angeles to help fund rebels in Nicaragua. - All of this is rather than about crack is about crap. Do you solemnly swear, that in the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I do. - One final point has been made, as one the persons who would run these programs told us, we are very capable, conscientious and dedicated scientists working for our country. Their work speaks for itself. This is Paul Altmeyer for ABC News, goodnight. Chop Chop Chang would not return to the public records until 1977, 13 years after his mysterious disappearance. Few surviving government files reported that the world famous chimp was quietly placed in the National Zoo in Washington DC, sometime in the spring of 1977. He was married to a female chimpanzee named Florence and fathered over six children. The marriage didn't last and the couple divorced in 1981, citing irreconcilable differences. Chop Chop Chang was eventually transferred to the Toledo Zoo where he was remarried to a female chimpanzee named Lilly. They stayed married until his death of natural causes in 1986 at the age of 42. - CIA documents reveal that Chop Chop would perform shows for all the visitors at the zoo, it was the best. The death of Chop Chop Chang shocked the nation. - Ladies and gentlemen, I planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the union, but the events of earlier today have lead me to change those plans. Today is a day for mourning and remembering. This is truly a national loss. Hundreds grieved the loss of the world's most beloved and famous monkey and he was given a proper military burial at Arlington Cemetery. - Chop Chop Chang, man. Sorry, I get a little emotional talking about him. I promise we've done everything in our power to honor the greatness he had. He's an inspiration to us all. He's a real hero. Our nation is bereaved. The whole world is poorer because of his loss. Because he has been our chosen leader at a time in history when his character, his vision and his quiet courage have enabled him to chart a course for us, a safe course for us, through the shoals of treacherous seas that encompass the world. And now that he is relieved of the almost superhuman burdens we imposed on him, may he rest in peace. - Chop Chop Chang is the reason I am the man I am today. No doubt about it. Sure I only make $2,500 a year, sure due to financial reasons I am currently living with my ex wife, the woman I once stated to be truly the devil incarnate, who often instigates very loud and very violent fights with me in a night after she's been drinking. But I owe my life to the great Chop Chop Chang himself and would gladly give it to him. We may never know the full story of Chop Chop Chang, the truth behind Operation Chimp, or what really happened during those 13 mysterious and undocumented years of his life. But his memory, his sacrifice, his legacy will forever live on in the hearts, minds and spirits of the American people. Rest in peace, Chop Chop Chang.
