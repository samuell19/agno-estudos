Where are your parents? You want a ride? Huh? Don't like to talk much, do you? You hungry, son? Hmm! Hyah! Whoa! Come on, boy. Hop on. Hyah! ( cow moos ) When was the last time you ate, boy? I don't why I bothered to ask. ( water splashing ) Well, let's get a few things straight here, boy. Now, you're not moving in here permanent. As soon as I can figure out what to do with you, we're gonna... ( water pouring ) ( metal clanging ) Now one thing I don't hold to around here is stealing. Now if you want something, you ask for it. You got that straight? But if you're hungry, eat. There's no free ride around here. You're going to be working for your breakfast. I hope you like horses, because that's where you're going to be sleeping. I fixed you a place in the barn loft. ( ♪♪♪ ) ( horses neighs ) ( ♪♪♪ ) Little thief. First he takes the cheese, now he wants my blanket. FARMER: Hey! What the blazes? Get down here, boy. If you're so anxious to help, get over there and give them horses some hay. I think I took on more than I bargained for with you. ( powerful neigh ) You okay there, chief? ( neigh ) He's not too fond of strangers. Not fond of anybody. He's never been broke. ( intense winny ) All right, old boy. We're going to leave you alone. ( neigh ) For the present anyway. Come on, let's go hunt up some breakfast. ( chickens clucking ) ( cow moos ) ( ♪♪♪ ) Oopsie... Hey! Breakfast is ready! ( horse neighing furiously ) ( ♪♪♪ ) ( neighing furiously ) ( light grunts ) Let's go eat breakfast before it gets cold. ( birds chirping ) ( engine running ) ( honk honk ) ( intense neighs ) ( honk honk ) ( powerful neigh ) Turn that contraption off, will ya! - Here's the future, John. Made it over here in 20 minutes. You know, that's eight miles in less than a half an hour. A man can make a fortune selling these things! - I think I'll stick to horses. They smell better. - Just came by to tell you my mare's ready. I'll bring her by tomorrow. - That's fine with me. - Where did he come from? - Oh, I found him lost the other day. [sarcastically] - Bet he's a lot of help. - I think you'd be surprised. He's got a way with horses. - You wake up tomorrow and find all your valuables gone, don't say I didn't warn you. Last bunch I hired got drunk, broke in the house, and stole all the food we had. Scared Marcey out of her wits. - Well, knowing you, you probably didn't pay them enough to eat on. - Yeah, well they always got enough to get drunk on. Savages... Knocking her down like that. Her being with child and all. - Yeah, I see your point. Well, I hope to rid of him in a day or two. I did catch him trying to pack off a brick of cheese. ( horse neighs ) - You know, you're never going to break that thing. Suppose I take him off your hands. I'll give you $150 for him. FARMER: You kind of liked this last colt. - It was all right. FARMER: No, I think I'm going to keep him. What time you coming by tomorrow? MAN: Midday. You think he'll be calmed down by then? - Well... If you leave that mechanical monster behind, I'm sure he'll be just fine. ( horse neighs ) ( steam hissing ) MAN: Hey! Better run, you little renegade. Ow! ( bang ) You touch my automobile again-- - He didn't mean any harm, Bill. He's just curious. ( grunting ) Dammit! What are you laughing at? - Nothing. Nothing at all. ( grunts ) ( engine turns ) ( horse neighs ) Yeah, I agree with you, pal. ( chickens clucking ) Oh, boy. What in the blazes is it now? ( chickens clucking wildly ) What in the world are you doing in here? Now I-- Get it out of here. ( squeak ) No, I don't want it. ( squeak ) Keep your distance with that thing, now. ( meow ) ( bird lightly chirping ) Now the next time you see a skunk after chickens... let him eat 'em! ( neigh ) Now when I get him out of the stall, you stand back. Because he's pretty calm now, but he's very unpredictable. ( snorting ) Easy now. ( neigh ) Easy now. ( snort, neigh ) Easy, boy. ( squeals ) Easy now. ( squealing ) Here we go. Uh! ( ♪♪♪ ) All right, here we go. ( squealing ) Uh! ( intense squealing ) ( intense squealing ) Ah! ( intense squealing ) Ah! ( light snorts ) Watch out! Get him! Move it! ( light snorts ) Can you back him off over there a little? ( light squeals ) ( horse blows ) I don't know what it is with you and horses, boy. But whatever it is, it's a God-given gift of some kind. Hand me that bottle. I really owe you, boy. Anything you want, anything at all, just ask. Ahh! I'll be teaching you something about horses... 'Cause with a little learning, you could be a good trainer yourself. - I'll take the horse. ( coughs, chokes ) - You speak English? - I will take the horse. - Is that all you can say? ( liquid pouring ) - The red horse, I'll take him. - You talking about my stallion? Ha! I'm sorry, son. I can't do that. I'm a breeder. I make half my living off that stallion. - You said you'd give me anything I want. - Sure, anything within reason. Well you know what I meant. Some clothes or sleeping in the house or something. - You promised. - Well, I wasn't talking about my stallion. He's a killer anyway. If it was any other horse, maybe I'd think about it. - You keep him here. I stay. You teach me about the horses. - No, you just think about something else. I don't even know your name yet. And you expect me to give you my top stallion, huh? - My name is Nuthatch Todacheenikee. Now can I have the horse? - No! I was just starting to like you. Nut- Nuthatch? Is that what you said? How in the world did you ever get saddled with a name like that? - My parents named us after the birds. - Well they must have run out of the better bird names before they got to you. - Big family. Can I have the horse? - No, no, no! I ain't gonna give that horse to you or anybody. And I ain't going to call you Nuthatch either. ( ♪♪♪ ) - Hey! You give me the horse, I let you call me Frank. - Oh, for heaven's sake... - How about Willy? - I liked it better when he wouldn't talk. ( ♪♪♪ ) JOHN: Miwok? I never heard of such a band. It's the strangest story I ever heard you falling off a train like that. ( water splashes ) How come nobody came back for you? - It was night. Everyone was sleeping. - Hey, Bill! Been expecting you. How are you, Mary? - Fine, thank you. BILL: What the devil happened to you? JOHN: Oh, that stallion got a little frisky. Thanks to the boy here, I'm able to tell about it. Frank, take these folks' horses and put them around there in the shade. - Still haven't gotten rid of that Indian kid, huh? - Look, Daddy, he's wearing a dress. - He had a run-in with a skunk. - Look, I want you to stay away from that kid, you hear me? - How come? - You just do what I tell you. ( sigh ) Where do you want me to put her? - Put her right in here. - Where the stallion? - Oh, I'm sure he'll show up for the event. ( rooster crows ) - Let's let him tease her a while, make sure she's in heat. ( snorting, neighing ) - Mary, why don't you go for a walk or something? Come on! ( neighing continues ) - Whatcha doin'? What's your name? Are you really an Indian? Boy, you sure don't like to talk much. Hey, how do you get up there? Come on! Let's go! Well, you coming? - Marcey doing any better? - She's still flat on her back. Doc Kaminsky says she'll probably have to stay that way 'til the baby comes. - You gonna get your boy this time? - I sure hope so. Doctor says this may have to be our last. - Wee! - I'll give you $300 for him, John. - Three hundred dollars? - That's my final offer. Take it or leave it. JOHN: Why would anyone want to pay that kind of money for a horse? BILL: Well, with proper training, I might be able to make a runner out of him. - You already got the fastest horse around. Besides, you can't run him if you can't break him. - That's my problem. - Well, I'll think about it. - Well, don't think too long. - No, I want to do it! - Well, I guess I better be going. Mary! Now where has that girl gone to? - Ah! - Mary! - Hey, don't you know girls are supposed to go first? Or maybe you are a girl! - if she's playing with that Indian... - What's the fuss, Bill? - Hey, let me see what's under that dress. ( Mary screams ) - Mary! ( Mary screams ) - Mary! - Oh, they're just kids. - Stupid Indian! ( scream ) ( Frank screams ) ( Mary screams ) - Let go of her! - He bit me! - I told you to stay away from him and I find you wrestling with him like you were some kind of a half-naked savage. - You all right, son? ( cow moos ) - I hope he hurt you good. Maybe that'll teach you not to mix with his kind. Where are your boots? - Left them in the barn. - Frank. Frank... If Bill Stenslough has any future dealing to do with that stallion, he's going to have to deal with you. Because he's yours. ( ♪♪♪ ) ( light snoring ) JOHN: Louise, have you got any of these in any smaller sizes? - Well, I've got a few of the denim britches but there are the last of the bunch on sale. - Well, I don't know. Can't wig out too much on him. I'll take these and the shirts. They'll shrink some, won't they? - Well, I could take them in a place or two. Why don't you come on over for Sunday supper and I'll do it then? - Well, that's mighty nice of you. But I think they'll be just fine. For now, anyway. - I'll, uh, put it on your bill, John. - No, thank you. I've got the cash. I know you got that mortgage payment coming due this month. - That's all been taken care of, John. I'll just put it on your account. - What, did you come into some big inheritance or something, Louise? That was no small sum as I recollect. The mortgage. - It's all been taken care of, John. - Well, I guess if you need heat, you have to sit by the stove. ( bells tolling ) Mind you don't get burned. ( bells tolling ) ( chatter of children ) ( excited screams ) ( ♪♪♪ ) Whoa. Whoa! You got to always respect the horse, Frank. You never know what he'll be thinking. I had a horse once, tame as a kitten for eight years. One day I got on him, he spun me around, threw me down on the ground, then tried to dance on my face. A couple minutes later, calm as could be. Never bucked since. All right now, the first thing I'm gonna have you do is jip him on the line. - What is jip? - That's where you let him exercise himself, at the end of this rope. You get off there in the middle, let him go around circles... You snap this whip, just like I showed you. Whoa! Whoa. All right, you ready? Okay, Frank, you've got him. Give it a try. ( ♪♪♪ ) - Whoa. - Talk to him! He'll listen. ( shouting in foreign language ) ( continues shouting ) - Came to pick up my mare. Is she all taken care of? - Yeah. She's over there in that last stall. BILL: Think that's safe? JOHN: He knows what he's doing. Pick up the pace a little. ( shouting in foreign language ) - I've never seen anything like it. The boy's a natural. - You had a chance to think on my offer? - What? - The stallion. Three hundred dollars. I brought it with me. - Sorry. Can't, Bill. - What do you mean you can't? - Well I'm not the only one involved here. - Four hundred dollars. ( sound of whip ) What do you mean you're not the only one involved? ( shouting in foreign language ) - Five hundred dollars. I get it. You won't sell him to me for $500, but you'll give him to that wahoo for nothing! - Bill, the boy saved my life. - Here's your stud fee. ( squealing loudly ) ( shouting in foreign language ) ( squealing loudly ) ( squealing subsides ) ( speaking in foreign language ) - If that means all -- break loose, it sure -- fits. - It means... ( non-English word ) Angry...angry storm. - Well that's what I said. Lighting and the thunder and the fury. - Fury. Maybe I'll call him Fury. What do you think, John? - Your horse. - You are the Red Fury. ( ♪♪♪ ) - That about sums it up for both of you, doesn't it? - He is smart. - Smart aleck, you mean. Give me that blanket. - Hey, John. Try this one. - You trying to tell me a horse knows the difference between blankets? - He likes this one. Frank's blanket. ( ♪♪♪ ) - Well, we'll just see about that. Well, I'll be. That beats anything I've ever seen. ( ♪♪♪ ) ( ♪♪♪ ) - Ahh! - Ugh. ( neigh ) ( John grunts ) You'd better rest or you're going to be dead. I will ride Fury. - Oh, no you don't.

( panting ) ( neigh ) ( ♪♪♪ ) Uh-- ( ♪♪♪ ) ( ♪♪♪ ) - You won that horse with love and care, Frank. Remember that. He'll do anything for you. Because horses need love just like people. ( sheep bleating ) FRANK: My father, he has sheep. But not so many. - I think you miss your family, don't you? - Sometimes, when it is night. - Yeah. JOHN: This is my family, Frank. Jenny, my little boy Ryan. He was two. The flu took him. Come on. It's chore time. JOHN: Whoa, whoa. - Hello, Mr. Handley. - Frank, take these horses over to the barn, will you? - Those are fine-looking animals. - Thanks. What can I do for you? - I'm Amelia Anderson. I'd like to have a few words with you if I may. - Sure. With me? - Yes. - Sure, come right on in. - Thank you. - You're from the East, aren't you? - Philadelphia, actually. - How you likin' it out here? - Oh, I must say, this country does grow you. - Go right on in. - All right. ( fly buzzing ) - On second thought, we can sit out here. - That would be fine. Thank you. Mr. Handley, I'm here to extend a special invitation for the boy to join us at our school. - Now, Ms. Anderson, wait a minute. Now the boy's only here temporarily. - Yes, I know. I've spoken to Sheriff Lam. The point is until his parents are found, he's got to fill his mind with something. Might as well be science and writing and arithmetic. - Well, that seems like a whole lot of trouble for nothing to me. Besides, I don't know whether or not he'd fit in. - You mean because he's an Indian. - Well like it or not, Ms. Anderson, his kind are not very well thought of around here. - Well, I think it's about time we changed all that, don't you, Mr. Handley? - Well, . I think you just might be stirring up a hornet's nest. - Over a young boy going to school? I tell you what, Mr. Handley. You let him come to school for one week, and if it doesn't work out, then we can at least say we made an effort. - Well, if that's what he wants to do. You want to go to school? - I think maybe I would like to learn. - Good! Then it's settled. Young man, I will expect to see you tomorrow morning at 8:00 sharp. All right? Well, I have to go now. Good bye, Mr. Handley. - All right. Just do the best you can do. That's all anybody can ask. I'm gonna leave your horse at that livery stable right across the way. You can ride him home. Good morning, Louise. - Ms. Anderson. ANDERSON: Good morning. My, those britches do suit him, John. He's a fine-looking boy. ANDERSON: Welcome to school, Frank. We need to make this official. We've got to put your full name here in my book. So that's Frank... - Nuthatch. - Nuthatch. - Toad - ah - cheenikee. - Todacheenikee. That's a very nice name. - Nuthatch? JOHN: Yeah. Some folks name their kids after presidents, others after birds. - I think I would like to call you Frankie, if that's all right with you. BOY: Geez... ( honk honk honk ) ( squealing wildly ) BILL: That heathen think he's sittin' in school with my Mary? - He's enrolled, if that's what you mean. - Well un-enroll him. - Why would I want to do that, Mr. Stenslough. - Be serious. You can't expect him to keep up with white kids. He'd just be holding everybody back. He don't hardly even speak American. - Well if I were to limit my enrollment based on a student's lack of fluency in English, no one would be eligible... including you. - Me and my folks have worked too hard to build this country into a place where decent, God-fearing folks can raise their kids in peace. I sure as -- ain't gonna-- - Excuse me. Children, would you all please take Frankie and show him around our playground? Go on! - I ain't gonna stand around while some do-good easterner backs us up a hundred years. The next thing you know, she'll be marrying 'em off to our kids and filling the place with little half-breeds! - That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Now until you can show me some legal reason why I should remove him, Frankie is going to stay in my class, and I am going to teach him. I may be new to the Wild West, but I have faced worse bullies than you on the streets of Philadelphia, and I'm not the least bit intimidated. - You're forgetting your place, Ms. Anderson. I happen to be on the school board. How do you think you got this job? - You're not the only one on the school board, Bill. LOUISE: He's right. You can't just order us around. This is a community matter. - Fine. Then we'll just bring it to a vote Thursday night when we meet. Don't worry, I'll get all the votes I need. Either that or I'll start calling in the favors people owe me. You might as well start packin', lady. You're as much as out of a job.

He tried to drown me. - Ah, Homer, he beat you fair and square. - Appears to me you boys are doing the ganging on him. - No, sir. - Let's get you out of those clothes. - What happened, Frank? - Me and Homer were teasing him first. - What are you doing apologizing? MARY: Frankie, where are you going? - Mary! You come back here! - Frankie, wait! - Hey, where you going with my boy's horse? - What the devil-- - Frankie! ( neigh ) BILL: Mary, you come back here! If that girl's hurt, John Handley, I'm holding you responsible. ( ♪♪♪ ) ( neigh ) - Thanks a lot for waiting. All I want to do is tell you how sorry I am for what happened. - I'm going home. Indians do not mix with your people. - And after all Mr. Handley's done for you. You must know Ms. Anderson likes you. And I'm starting to like you. That's at least three white folks. - Only takes one bad one to make trouble. Like your father. I'm going home now. - How can you go home? You don't even know where it is. And whatcha gonna eat out there on the desert? - You think Indians are stupid. - I don't think you're stupid. I just think you're stubborn. You would run off without even giving your horse a chance to run in the 4th of July race. - You think Fury can win? - I don't think I've ever seen a horse as fast as yours. All he needs is a little training. It's the biggest race in the area. You could really make a name for yourself. Besides, it wouldn't hurt for someone besides my daddy to win that race, would it? - Maybe I will stay, but I will not go back to school. School is not a good place. - No one's forcing you, but if you did, you'd at least have one friend. - I want a promise that this won't happen again. And that those involved will make a greater effort to get along. Do I make myself clear? [weakly] CHILDREN: Yes, ma'am. - Do I make myself clear? [stronger] CHILDREN: Yes, ma'am. - That's better. I'm going to give you a 15 minute recess and I want you all to answer the bell. No lollygagging. All right, go ahead and play. And play nice! ( screams ) ANDERSON: Frankie... Would you come here please? ( indistinct chatter ) BOY: Hey, let's play marbles. - Sit down with me. I want to say how sorry I am for the way some people treated you yesterday. It was unkind and it was unfair. It's too bad there are people that like to stir up trouble. - Like Hopi. - What do you mean? - Hopi are worse than Kiowas. They're like snakes. - Frankie, stop that! Believing that makes you no better than Mr. Stenslough with his prejudice. Do you know what the word 'prejudice' means? It's when someone doesn't like someone else just because they're different. And sometimes they will do unkind things because they're different. Now if everyone in the world returned evil for evil, what kind of a world do you think we'd be living in? Would you do me a favor? Would you think about that? All right, go on outside. - I think John likes you. Maybe you could be his woman. Chop wood, make babies... He needs a good woman. - Frankie, go play. - Hey, Frankie. No, don't worry. I just came to make things square with you. Sorry about the fight. Teacher's right. Might as well try to get along. Pa gave me four bits and I'm gonna buy you anything you want. Maybe we could be blood brothers. Come on. - You want some candy? Now, no pushin'. - Look 'em over. Take your pick. Nice one, huh? That what you want? Sure, I can handle that easy. I'll go pay for the stuff. You better get back or Ms. Anderson will skin ya. - Well, Homer. Whatcha got there? - Reed of licorice ropes. - Didn't your folks ever teach you not to eat stuff before it's paid for? - Sorry, ma'am. - Is that all? - Yep. - Wasn't that Indian boy with you? - Oh, no. Not with me. ( bell on door rings ) ( cash register jingles ) ( indistinct whispers ) - I need to talk to you right away. A very expensive pocket knife was removed from the glass case at the mercantile during recess. - Mrs. French informs me that something very valuable was taken from her store during recess. This is a most serious charge. But she's being very nice about it. All she asks is whoever took it to return it. I'm disappointed. All of you who were in the store during recess stand up right now and empty your pockets onto your desk. Everyone that was in the store. Where did you get this, Frankie? - Homer bought it for me. HOMER: Hey! Don't drag me into it. - Is what he says true, Homer? - No! All I got was some candy. Ask Ms. French. - As far as I know, that's correct. - I'm going to investigate this further, you two. Now is not the time or place. But I assure you I will get to the bottom of this. - I did not lie. Homer said he would buy it for me. He said he wants to be my friend. Homer's a liar. - All right. I'm going to take your word. Want to go water the stock? - I believe him. - So do I. - This isn't going to look too good for us at the board meeting, is it? Bill Stenslough is going to have a field day. - Maybe we should just pack this thing in. We can't beat Bill at the kind of game he plays. Besides, you could lose your job. - You sound like everyone else. I have never seen a town so full of cowards. - I'm no coward. I'm just no fool. - Don't you ever think about what's right or wrong? - Yes, I do! And I'm not so sure that subjecting that boy to that kind of humiliation is so -- right either. - Oh, running away from the problem is? I'm really disappointed. From what everyone has told me in this town, I thought you had more backbone than that. - It's not a matter of backbone. All your principles sound fine coming from a book. And another thing, maybe you shouldn't be so quick to judge people until you've lived around them longer. - Well how should I judge a man who lives the way you do? Look at this place! There's-- there is clutter everywhere. You've got liquor stashed in every nook and cranny. Why, if your wife could see you like this. - You leave Jenny out of this. - I'm sure you take better care of your stock than you do yourself. Why, you are a far cry from the man I thought you were. Your wife and son are dead and you buried yourself with them. - Ms. Anderson, I think you've overstepped your bounds. - Perhaps... You're right, Mr. Handley. ( ♪♪♪ ) MAN: The motion's before us to expel the boy from school. Bill, why don't you present your side of it first. BILL: It's not my intention to get into the question of race here. So, in my mind it's a legitimate concern. The primary issue is whether or not the association of our children with this Indian boy can have a damaging effect on their characters. John Handley, did you not tell me that the first thing this boy did after you showed him the kindness of giving him shelter was to steal from you? - Oh, come on, Bill. - Well did he or didn't he? - He was hungry. He took some cheese. - The next thing you know I find him trying to steal the radiator cap from my automobile -- in broad daylight. Is that true, John? - Bill, if you're going to stand up there and pick on every little thing that you've ever heard about an Indian-- - Mary, come up here. On my next trip to John's place, that boy physically attacked my daughter. ( gasps ) She's here as evidence. Sheriff, since some of the folks won't be able to see from where they're sittin', would you describe to them what you see on her leg? - I do believe it's teeth marks. BILL: What you might expect from an animal. But it came from him. All right, your Aunt Lydia will take you home. Then of course there was the mud bath incident. Disrupting a whole day of school, causing our children to wallow like hogs, and then luring off my Mary. - Mr. Stenslough, you know as well as I do Mary went of her own accord. - But the very fact that one of the sweetest little girls in this valley doesn't see anything wrong with stealing a horse, playing hooky, and then running off all day with a boy into the wild is just further proof of the kind of influence he has on our children. ( indistinct chatter ) And finally, Mrs. French, would you please stand? Would you tell these good folks what that boy did the day before yesterday during recess? - Well, he, um... He took a knife from the store. ( indistinct chatter ) ( book banging ) MAN:Quiet! - As far as Ms. Anderson goes, it's my strong feeling that any teacher who doesn't place the welfare and character of our children first has no business teaching them. ( indistinct chatter ) - Now Ms. Anderson has asked to speak for herself and the boy. - Thank you. Certainly the boy has gotten himself into some trouble. But is that so unusual for a boy his age? I don't know if Frankie took that knife. I don't think he did. But even if it were true, would it be the first time a youngster has pocketed something shiny from the mercantile? I can't guarantee he'll stay out of trouble any more than any of you parents can say your children will be little angels for the rest of their lives. Mr. Stenslough claims to be for square for progress, civilization, and Christian ethics. Well, if organized hate is progress, I want no part of it. And if Mr. Stenslough can find some scriptural justification for his outrageous ethnic bias, then his Bible is a vastly different edition than mine. I say it is not I but Mr. Stenslough and his narrow-minded cronies who wish to back this country up right back into the dark ages. ( applause ) - I'm now going to bring this to a vote. Starting with you, Bill. For or against expelling the boy from school? - For. - Henrietta? - For. - Well, I'm against the idea. ( indistinct chatter ) Quiet! Sheriff, your vote. - Hell, all this ruckus over an Injin kid who might not even be around long anyway. I mean, if I gotta vote, I say keep him on. ( approvals from audience ) - Two in favor, two opposed. Looks like it's up to you, Louise, to break the tie. Louise? I'm going to call for your vote. Well what is it, Louise? For or against expulsion? - For. ( indistinct chatter ) - Quiet! Quiet! Quiet, please! Frankie, you understand what's happened? You've been expelled from school. Now I'm not sure it's fair, but democracies aren't always fair. Now let's get the rest of it over with. All those in favor of dismissing Ms. Anderson and gettin' another school teacher, raise your hand. Opposed? That concludes our business. Meeting adjourned. ( indistinct chatter ) ANDERSON: Ladies and gentlemen, please, may I have your attention for just one more moment. I appreciate your support, but under the circumstances I will not be able to continue teaching. I will tender my resignation in writing in the morning. Thank you. - Ms. Anderson! You have a contract! You've got six weeks left! - Frankie, I'm sorry. ( ♪♪♪ ) - Amelia... Amelia. Amelia, I'm proud of you for what you said in there. And I only wished that I'd backed you up more. - Well, that's very kind of you to say so. Now, if you don't mind, I'm very tired. - Wait a minute. Let me walk you home. Frank, why don't you wait for me in the wagon. Hope you realize that they're going to be pounding on your door in a day or two to start teaching again. - Maybe, maybe not. - I hope you're not thinking about heading back east. We need you right here in Grafton. - Well if they want me to teach again, they know my terms. In the meantime, I'm not gonna sit idly by doing nothing. - What are you aimin' to do? - Teach Frankie. With your permission of course. - All right. All right. Pay isn't too good. ( chortle ) - Frankie really has such a thirst for knowledge. I don't see any reason why I couldn't have him up to a level three or four in a very short time. I'd like to start tomorrow. - Sure. You know, Bill Stenslough didn't know what he was up against when he locked horns with you. Be interesting to see who he comes up with for your replacement. Well, at this late date, he may end up teaching school himself. - That'll be the day. - Three little ships under the command of Captain Christopher Newport sailed up the James River and anchored off a grass-- All right. Who did that? I said who did that? Nobody's leaving this classroom until I get a confession. ( squish ) ( chuckles ) Class dismissed. ( gleeful screams ) ( gleeful screams ) ( honk honk ) ( honk honk ) ( honk honk ) ( honk honk ) Stay away from my automobile. - I'm gonna get you! - My heavens! What's going on out here? I hear you're quite a teacher. - I'd like to see you do any better. - My . What have you got on your britches? - Never mind. - I thought school was supposed to last 'til 3:00. Bill Stenslough, you promised us a new school teacher. Here it is the middle of June. School's almost out. - Boy, it's a shame, all right. All because folks couldn't put up with one little Indian boy. - I don't need that from you, Doc. Just give me one of those entry forms. - I thought you'd given up the horses. Well, what with you driving the new machine and all. Give the rest of us a chance at the 4th of July race. ( laughs ) - Hey, I wonder what this does. ( engine turns ) ( excited cheers ) - Hey! What are you doing to that car? Come back here with my car! ( ♪♪♪ ) ( indistinct shouting ) Come back here with my car! ( laughs ) ( ♪♪♪ ) ( metal clanging ) - Six times two? - Twelve. - Good. Two times five? - Ten. JOHN: One more length of pipe and we got water. ANDERSON: Wonderful! All right, what's this one? - Eight. ( horse neighs ) - Frankie... We only have a few more. You have plenty of time to sign up for that race. - She's right, Frank. You can't do any bettin' if you don't know your numbers. - John, what are you teaching this boy? - Horse racing. I'm leavin' the school teachin' to you. - All right, you two. Go play with the horses. I'll have supper ready when you get back. - You know something? You're not a bad person. ( ♪♪♪ ) - All right, now right here is where the race is won or lost, right here on this mark. When this rope drops, your horse is going to shoot out of here like greased lightning. Only you're going to hold him back. Just enough to keep him in control. Not too much, or else he'll be standing here and the race will be over. ( engine cuts ) - What's going on? - The 4th of July race comin' up. Or haven't you heard? No Injin ride in that race. JOHN: Nothing in the rules against it. Doc Kaminsky signed him right up. - You can't be serious. - I'm dead serious. You're not thinking about dropping out, are you? MARY: My daddy's not afraid of that stallion. Are you, Daddy? - I tell you what, let's find out what the half-broke mustang of yours can do. - Yeah? What do you mean? - I mean right now. - He hasn't been trained to race yet. - Well, if he's half as fast as you think he is, he shouldn't lose by more than five lengths. - Yeah. So? - So I'll wager you a $20 gold piece that he can't come within five lengths of Calsaurus. And if I win, you gotta agree that he don't enter that race on the fourth. - Uh uh. We'll take it. ( ♪♪♪ ) Ready? ( ♪♪♪ ) Go! Go! - Come on, Fury! Come on, Fury. You can do it. Come on, Cal! - Come on, Cal. Come on. All right, you got him, Cal! ( ♪♪♪ ) - Come on, Fury! - Ah ha! You got him, Cal! Come on! Come on. You've got him. Come on. ( ♪♪♪ ) Come on, Cal. Come on, come on. ( ♪♪♪ ) - See ya on the fourth. ( sniffling ) What are you so teary-eyed about?

( grunts ) - My leg! - Don't you have some liquor anywhere? - I think I picked a bad time to quit drinking. - Hold onto the bedpost. - Frank, there's an old crutch out in that tool shed. - All right. ( crack ) - Ahh! Ahh... I thought you were supposed to be my good luck charm. ( exhales ) ( knock at door ) - Mr. Stenslough, what is it? - Where's John? - Well, he's lying down. He hurt himself trying to fix the windmill. What's wrong? - Marcey's bad. The baby's coming. I think it's backwards. I gotta get Doc Kaminsky. - Isn't he in town? - No, he's out at the Taylors'. - The Taylors'. That's-- - It's going to take me over an hour to get him and I'm afraid to leave Marcey alone with just Mary there. I'm afraid she's going to die. - All right, all right. Frankie! Here, you tend to John. John, I need to go with Mr. Stenslough. JOHN: Yeah, I'll be all right. I wish I could help you, Bill. ( thunder ) ( cracking ) - Watch out! - Ah! ( crash ) - Mr. Stenslough. Bill! Come on, get up! ( wind howling ) ( exhales ) BILL: It's too late. She's gonna die. I know she's gonna die. I gotta get the doc. - Oh, no, now calm down. She's not going to die. - I will ride to the Taylors' house. - Frank, do you know where the Taylors live? - It's by the train crossing. - That's 16 or 17 miles. Are you sure you still want to do it? - I will ride Fury. - You know what that can do to your horse? Driving in this rain storm. - Fury can make it. ( thunder ) - Why would he do that? He ought to hate my guts. - We must ride tonight, like never before. - Let me give you a boost. Be careful. - Fury is strong. We'll be all right.

I can see the light! You did it, Fury! Doctor, please, come quickly! Ms. Stenslough's very sick! - Oh, I'm so sorry. I'll come right with you. Sorry, Carl. - Take care of yourself, Carl. Come on! CARL: Good luck, Doc! - I'll go draw a warm bath for the boy. - Fine. ( Fury squealing ) - I'm sorry, Fury. I'm sorry. Please, help. - We've got to get him in the barn, dry him off. Come on, boy. Come on. ( squealing ) KAMINSKY: Marcey... - Oh, Doctor... - Marcey, just relax now. - I can't-- - Don't do any more pushing. The baby's still all crooked. I'm going to make an incision right here and lift the baby out. There's no cause for worry now. Amelia? - Yes. - I'm gonna need your help. - All right. - Bill, best you leave. Please? - Hand me that blanket, Frankie. We're gonna have to try and get him warm. He's starting to quiver already. Get the other end of it. That's it. Good. That's fine. Okay. Now I'm gonna get you warm and dry. - I will stay with Fury. - There's nothing you can do now but wait. But first we're going to get you and your clothes dry. Come on.
