When a travelerin north central Louisiana takes a wrong fork at thejunction of Boudreaux Road, just beyond Thibodeau's Corners, he comes upon a lonely, curious country. Here sits the Whateley house, a cold, desolate place. Hundreds of years ago, whenthe talk of voodoo and Satan worship was commonplace, thelocals would warn strangers to stay far, far away. It was here, 10 years ago, that the unimaginable happened, the unspeakable. Athena Whateley. She was 35 years old. She did nothing to hide her pregnancy to others in that small town. She never spoke of the child.. Some conjectured that OldMan Whateley, her father, was responsible for her pregnancy. Those wounds were too sinister, even for this small town. Any reference to such a strange family. I see it. Here it comes, Logan. It's a boy. He... he beautiful. Yes, dear. Why is this happening? I want my baby back. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK. Father? It's all right. It's all right. The cut isn't bad. I'll go. No way. It's too... too powerful. If I can't do anything, there's little that you can do. I can try. Dr. Alridge, thank God. It's much worse than when I called. This is my associate, Dr. Morgan. Good evening. Good evening. May I ask you how long you've owned this house? Two months. She started acting strangeright after we moved in. She's home on a break from college, and we were just hoping tospend some time with her. Can you help us? Her room... was it always a bedroom? Or was it an attic? It was an attic. We just added a wall and made it into her room. How much renovation? We added new flooring and dry wall. What does all of this haveto do with what's going on? This house was built by a Silas Brown, a well-known practitioner of theoccult and a demon worshipper. Chances are good that he built something into the roomto assist in his sorcery. And he left something behind. Does the entity have a name? Yes. Splendid. And give us 30 minutes. If we don't come out, spread the contents of this over the entire doorway. What is it? Just do as I ask. Dr, you may want to keep that jacket on. I'm just a simple girl. I just want to be left alone. I just want to play with my toys. I'll handle this. Try and find it. So what's your name? Caitlin. well, that's a quaint name for a 60,000-year-oldalien demon. The gates are about to open. And I'll be the first.. Well, don't get toocomfortable because you're going right back. Almost. Got it. No! Sumerian ritual pyramid. 5,000 years old. The pyramid! Ipsil. You all right, Faye? Yeah. I'm fine. Top section always clockwise. Got it. Won't happen again. Sure hope not. Someone or something has opened a portal. We have to close it. So after reviewing chapter 10, what is the difference between the Cthulu cults of ancientMesopotamia in comparison to the other polytheiticreligions of similar cultures during the Iron Age? Ms. Badish? No? Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones? Bryce, the only person who seems to care. The Cthulhu deities were all evil, unlike the Egyptians and Greeks, who were benevolent and malevolent gods. That's correct. Also, in James Garland's book, he hypothesizes that these gods were actually extraterrestrials, and primitive man... Yes, but that conversationis for next week. Also, most cultures wentto their gods in the sky or on mountains, whereas the Cthulhu living under the ocean. Thank you, Bryce. And that's what they called.. Bryce, that's quite enough. Thank you. Well, I guess it's about that time, so as our friend Bryce alluded to, let's discuss chapter one ofDr. Garland's book next week. Thank you. Have a good day. Pardon me, Dr. Rice... Bryce, office hours are on Tuesday. I have an appointment today, OK? I'll have your schedule by 10:00 AM tomorrow. All right. That is not dead which can eternal lie. Strange eons even death may die. Yeah. It's so good to see you. Yeah. Same here, my good friend. It's been too long. Yes, it has. We should grab a coffee... catch up. What brings you all the way up here? Well, we brought you another piece for the collection. We? Hello, Walter. Hi, Faye. So you want to see the piece? Definitely Sumerian. I'd put this at about 2000 BC.- 3000. Look at the markings. I did. These markings are consistentwith pre-Babylonian, late first dynasty. But at first glance, at the second tier glyphs... He's the linguistic expert. Let him do the analysis, Faye. And just as Dr. Garland suggested, articulated subsections. Have you tried to move them? No! No, stop! If it's broken, please don't fix it. If it hurts, then you can kill it. Gotta stretch my legs. Wow, these are old. There's not even a credit card terminal. I'll go pay inside. All right, baby. Hey, I'll probably get a soda. You want something? - Yeah, sure. Just a water. OK. Hey, let's go ahead and fill up. We've still got three hours to Houston. You got it, hot stuff. Do you have a bathroom? Thanks. Hey. Bathroom. Save me that key, baby. Now I gotta go. Yo. Yeah, man. We got about three or four hours left. Yeah, it's brutal, man. The I-10's all torn up. Yeah, we'll be seeing ya. Well... Yeah, all right. That's great. With all due respect, weare all far too educated to believe that this mythology, this archeology that we've studied our entire lives is real. You don't have to believe. Obtaining the book and helping us translate it would be quite the feather in your cap. It's because of truebelievers like the two of you that securing the Necronomicon would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. It's hidden. And wherever it's hidden, it's protected by cultists and religious fanatics. So even if you did find it, you'd probably be killed beforeyou could ever bring it back. A portal has been opened between our world and the realm of the old. With them come chaos and destruction. Why do you need it? There are several translations. I have one. There's one in BuenosAires, there's one in Paris. All of them are incomplete. Page 751. Every copy, every translationis missing page 751. That page contains theincantations needed to open the portal, and to close it. Only the original has page 751. But I just don't see that... At the very least, it's animportant piece of history. Whoever retrieves it willbe showered in accolades. Not to mention all the research grants. And the press. OK. I see where the two of you are going with this. We'll have to compare notes. Nobody's even seen the original since John Dee translated it in 1603. Then we start at 1603. We're gonna have a party, Agnes. It's my boys' birthdays, and they're coming home. We're gonna getpretty pretty for my baby. I can't wait to see my baby. Shut up! Just shut up! Wilbur's home. Wilbur! Wilbur's home! Wilbur! Hello, Mother. Whatcha got there? A present for your brother? Yes. Well done, boy. Take care of your brother. Shh. Soon it'll be all over for you. This indicates that Dee gave the original to the Anglican church. Well, that would explain this. An unnamed book with great significance kept by the Knights Templar in Scotland. Well, that was until theylost that in a fire in 1789. A fire that was most likely a diversion to steal the real book. Well, where'd it go? America. Taken here by a group knownas the Black Brotherhood? Olas Wormius. The Dutch alchemist? Yes. He translated the book beforeJohn Dee translated the book. What are you thinking? Ask him. He'll know. And how do we do that? A seance, or a psychic? According to my calculations, he died 700 years ago. He explained to me thetrue history of the old ones. The secret cults that have existed forever. He claimed to have been bornduring the Shang dynasty. Please. That would make him over 3,000 years old. OK, far be it for me to guessthat he's really in his mid 60s somewhere. Where? Well, the last time I sawhim was in southern Louisiana. He was overseeing avoodoo cult in the Bayou. What would he know? He knew about the brotherhood, and for a time he was a member. Yeah, he knows their secrets. Well, it sounds like as gooda place as any to start to me. You're gonna need this. I'm going to stay behind andtry and figure out who or what is behind all this, sowhen you obtain the book, well, we'll know where to use it. Pick me up? 10? Same place? Do you live alone? I'd hate for it to be awkward, and all. Wait outside. I'll come out. You two kids are going to be fine. Six years is a long time. You know, people move on. Sometimes. Are you going to be all right? Dealing with him? Well, our personal history is just that. History. I'm more concerned aboutinvolving him in general. Well, he's the only one that can translate the original text. But he doesn't believe. His believing is irrelevant. Once he translates it, I'll perform the ritual. But they... they prey on nonbelievers. Remember what happened to Darelith? Well, before longhe'll see it for himself. Then we'll be glad to have him on our side. Let's just hope he doesn'tgive up before we get that far. The time is close, boy. Seven days until your 10th birthday. You know what that means? Yes. You been practicing for the big day? I will be ready. Henry paid me a visit yesterday. Henry Armitage? In the flesh. Was she with him? Yes. She was. What do they want? Shame I missed them. I would have loved to have said hello. - You would have? - No. Not really. What did they want? Well, they brought me anew piece for the collection. It's a Samaritan ritual pyramid. It's quite nice, really. And they also asked for me to help them find the Necronomicon. Well, what did you tell them? I said I would help. Why? I don't know. You're just feeding their delusions. It's not healthy. - I know. I know. It's an important piece of history. Yeah, well, some relics are best left buried. The missing pages. There is a copy at the University in Arkham. I will steal it. Good. Henry was going on abouta portal, or something. He said that all thecopies of the Necronomicon are missing page 751. Only the original has that page, so... And page 751 contains the spells and incantations necessary toopen and close said portal? Precisely. Why do you know that? We took a trip to, New England. To a small town called Innsmouth, I believe. A seaside village. The trip seemed innocuousenough at first, but I soon realized thatHenry was up to something. You should go. Fetch it now. Yes. Who is going to feed him? He needs to grow. I'll Have your worthlessmother do it while you're away. Give her a reason to continue to breathe. There was a cult there, that Henry was trying to stop. A cult attempting to opena portal between our world and the world of the old ones. It was a very complex and detailed ritual. It was quite the big deal. Here, you see... first theyhad to find a willing female... A woman to give birth to these twins. One of the twins would be human, the other would be an inhuman manifestation of the god Yog-Sothoth. It means for the twins, 10 years shall be 40. Yes. One of the cultists was going on about how these twins would age rapidly. So if you run into any40-year-olds with the intellect of a child, you be careful. Wilbur? Yes, Pa? We have many enemies. Mankind cannot comprehendthe new world order. I know. When the planet isliberated by the old ones, only the true believerswill prosper in the new age. Mind your steps, boy. I'll find a way, Grandpa. Or I'll make a way. Once this inhumanchild grows large enough, it holds open the portal for thelarger, more powerful old ones to enter our world. And thereby starting the apocalypse. The original cult was lookingfor the Necronomicon, as well. They were trying to find a man named Olas Wormius to help them. That's interesting. Henry set up an appointment for me to meet with him later this evening. I tried to tell him that the real Olas has been dead for over 700 years, but he didn't believe me. It's also quite convenient that he only lives four hours north of here. But they're convinced that he's legitimate. Those two areconvinced of quite a bit. Indeed, they are. Do me a favor. Be careful. These cultists, they... takethis stuff very seriously. You're quite cavalier with people, if you don't mind me saying, so just watch your step. I'll be careful. Can I borrow these? Well, they're part of my private collection. I will take care of them. I'll guard them with my life. All right. Just be very careful with them. Thank you. - Lunch on Monday? - Yes. Yes, yes. Where is she, freak? Where is she? Who? Amanda! You were the only other personthere when she disappeared, man. Where is she? Stop! She's inside. I will take you to her. Brandy? Good! Company! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Upstairs. After you. The both of you! Now! God! No! Go upstairs, boy. She's waiting for you. What the... You're late. I'm sorry. I thought I was early. Well, when we were together, you were never ready on time. You were usually a minimumof 15 minutes late. So I gave you the benefit of the doubt and showed up 10 minutes after we agreed. This is going to be a long drive, isn't it? I never said that. If you didn't, why wouldit be burned into my memory? I don't know. Overactive imagination? Delusions? You're brilliant, Fay. You're brilliant. Dr. Armitage is a wonderful man, and I think he's a great teacher, but you're following him into his cult. It's not a cult. It's not? I thought you were smarter than that. You haven't seen what we've seen. You turned your back on us before the truth could be revealed. The truth? It's mythology, Fay. It's legends and storiesfrom prehistoric dreamers and science fiction authors. It's not real. - Believe what you want. It's not real. I know... I know what's out there. I know what we must do, and I know the consequences if we fail! That's why we didn't work. You lost all respect, because you think you're smarter than us. I just always found your relationship with Dr. Armitage... Atypical. Do you think we slept together? Me and Henry? I can't do it without you. Grandpa said you would have to do it. I'm... I've been here since you were born. You can't leave me here with him. I'm afraid! There's nothing to be afraid of. This is it. This is where we start. Can I help y'all? We're here to see Olas. No Olas here. I sell bait and crawfish, when the season is right. Armitage sent us. He gave me this to give to you. It's... I know what it is. The question is do y'all know what it is? Where y'all asking to go? What y'all asking to see? We have a question for Olas. We need to speak to him. Olas answers allquestions with the truth. Look within. You'll find all the answers you need. Please. We've given you what you need to take us. Out back there's a little boat. Take it. Paddle upstream. North. How far north? You'll know. OK, great. Thank you. Thank you. Christ. I think that Yoda back therewas a little over-dramatic. Well, you said yourself, people believe in this. They'll protect it. Try and scare us away. When I was six, I stopped going to church. I told my mother that I was sickof hearing about virgin births, and burning bushes, and a godthat would condemn a good man who doesn't believe while welcoming a mass murderer who repents. Some blind, Creole crawfish peddler's not going to change my mind. Sometimes you have to believein things you can't see. There are higher truths. Fay, as much as I love you, you can't convince me, either. What? I don't think in the sixyears that we were together, you ever once said that you loved me. Of course I did. Didn't I? Dr. Rice. Dr. Morgan. We have been expecting you. Pick up. Come on, pick it up. This is Henry. Now listen... There's a connection between the girl's family from the exorcism and a Puritan era cult near Dunwich. And the girl is a direct descendant. She's coming down here to meet with me, so call me with an update... Can I help you? Dr. Rice? No, I'm Dr. Armitage. Dr. Rice. Is away on business. Can I take a message? Maybe you can help me. Dr. Rice is the curator ofthe Antiquities Collection, is he not? Yes. I'm looking for a book in his library. A book? Which book? I'll know it when I see it. Well... I'm not really very familiar with the surroundings here. Books... book, book, book. Would it be one of these? No? What's your name, friend? Whateley. Wilbur Whateley. Yeah. OK. I think I might know where they are. Why don't you follow me? Please enter. Sit. The master shall be here soon. I think we're wasting our time. Shh. The master OlasWormius will see you now. Good. There are a great manybooks here, Mr. Whateley. It might help if you could describe it to me. There. You're not going to find it. That's a copy. Like yours. There's no page 751. Where is the original? I don't have it. It's you. You opened the portal. What do you know of such things? You summoned Yog-Sothoth. He holds the door open for the others. Yes. It grows. Grows strong enough to holdit open for the old ones. Where? Help me find the book. I'm like you. I'm a member of the brotherhood. Then... you will help me? Brother. Where is it? I will not tell you. I will take you. Air. I need my air. All my life you've been telling me I'm no good. I can't do anything. I need my air. Boy needs to be fed. Boy needs to be fed! I can't leave! Boy needs to be fed! What's wrong with you? Well, he's gonna get fed! What are you doing? What are you doing? Come and get it, boy! What? No, no, no! No! No! No! No! Welcome. It's quite the entrance, sir. Olas. Dr. Armitage... I know why you are here. You seek the book. The book that is hidden. The book that should never be found. That's right. With the old ones comes chaos. They are not of our world. They lie in sleep, waiting to return. To plunge mankind into madness. Someone has opened a portal. The old ones are attemptingto come into this world. Now. We must stop them. I know. I have seen them. Cthulhu. Speaks to me in dreams. Warns me of the impending apocalypse. Begging me to unfree him. Did he happen to mentionwhere we might find the book? For centuries the book was in my possession. It was stolen from me by the Black Brotherhood. Later it fell into the hands of a witch. A witch who escaped persecutionduring the Salem Witch Trials. That witch's descendant... a man came Ward... Now holds the book. 100 Prospect Road. Do you have a zip code for that? So I can type it into my MapQuest? No, never mind. I'm sorry. Can we go? Thank you. The house is not what you expect. I'm not surprised. Thank you. You do not believe, Dr. Rice. No. Good. Remember that when you are inside. I can't believe you were unaffected by that. I can't believe that you were. I've seen much better acts on the Vegas strip. The man levitated into the room. That's called a parlor trick. You know, using rational thought, Fay, you can explain the most extraordinary things. You're very cold. I'm very practical. Very practical. Do you have faith in anything? Yes. Nothing from Armitage. I hope he's made some progress. I hope we make some progress. I have this strange feeling we're going to run into anotheridiot speaking gibberish with grave seriousness. What? What time do you have? I don't. It stopped. Mine, too. He is here. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the keyand guardian of the gate. Past, present, and future. All are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the oldone broke through a void. And there they will break through again. This one looks rather inviting. It's charming, really. Don't bet on it. Shall we? Hello? OK, let's split up. You should take upstairs. No. We should stay together. OK. What did he say to you, right before we left? He said that it was goodthat I didn't believe. I wonder what he meant by that? Nothing. He meant nothing. It was actually meant tobe more spooky mumbo jumbo. Well, we're wasting a lot of time. Old relics are found buriedin caves and dig sites, not sitting in an empty old bed and breakfast. It's not what we expect. Mr. Ward? Well, that's going to takeme a little longer to explain. Who this? He's here to help us. I like him. Quiet, Mother. What... happened to Grandpa? He, um... he, um... He gave himself to feed your brother. He would not do that. He... he... he did. That was not the plan. He... he changed the plan. He said you'd understand. You... I didn't have a choice. I can't leave. How dare you? He was gonna kill me, Wilbur. He was gonna kill your mama! We've already gone up three flights. I know. I swear this house only hadtwo stories when we came in. Look at this hallway. It goes on forever. I see a light. I don't need you. You will be next. Al Hazared. The author of the Necronomicon. Remarkable. Come here. Help me. The door's not there anymore. We're trapped. Don't come any closer, boy. I am not afraid. Wilbur? Wilbur! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it, Wilbur. I'm so sorry. Wilbur! I'm so sorry! Mama didn't mean it. I'm so sorry, baby. Mister, you ain't gonna shoot me now, are ya? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's OK. I shouldn't have left you. It's OK. Walter... I love you. Wait. We never left the bayou. Wait, wait, we never left the bayou. It's not real. Focus. Think! OK. OK. It's not real. So why are we still here? He said that the old onesspeak to him in dreams, right? Right. Right. Right. We're in a dream. The book is hidden in this house. What? We can't just make it appear in front of us. No. We can't take the book from the dream. The book doesn't exist. It never did. That's why there isn't an original. The house is the book. The house is the book. The house the book. Help me. Go. Over here. It's gonna be over there. It's over there. So, Dr. Rice, now do you believe? Ask me when this is over. Fay? Henry? We have it. We're on our way to you. Are you still at the university? It's... it's worse than we expected. I'm going to try and dosomething to slow it down. I'm still here. I'll wait for you. Right. We're on our way. Henry? Dr. Armitage? He said he would be here. Call him. Find out where he went. Straight to voicemail. Hello? Caitlin? What are you doing here? Dr. Armitage called me. He said he had some questionsabout my great grandfather. What's your last name? Bowers. This makes no sense. I mean, it's not like him to do this. Something is amiss. He fully intended to be here. Someone or something drew him from here. Yeah, but where? I don't know. Amelia? Can you bring me the security log, please? Anyone after hours, anybodywho listed me as a contact. Just one. A Whateley? Whateley. Does the nameWhateley mean anything to you? No. Should it? This is a list of the occultists and the families tied to theold ones over the centuries. So a Mr. Whateley came to the office last week to visit Dr. Armitage? No. He came here to see me. To get this. Grab your things. Let's go. Directions. Wow. He's good. Yeah. He is. I need you to drive while I study this. You got it. What is she doing here? Well, the old ones speakthrough family lineage. They spoke through her grandfather, and now they speak through her. Yeah. And it could be useful. Are you sure you want to do this? 24 hours ago I was convinced this was all a big heaping pile of... Nonsense. I felt that way 24 hours ago. So? So? I've seen things that I can't explain. I've experienced things faroutside the realm of normal, and if any of it is true, or even if it's partly true, what we're about to experience is not for the squeamish. Dr. Rice, I was possessed. Now, I don't remember much ofit, but from what they told me, I had bat wings growing out of my back. So I'm down. Fine. I've got shotgun. You remember anything, Caitlin? Not a lot. I mean... I rememberthings before it happened. Such as? Well, I started sleepwalking. I would walk outside, into the yard. I drew things on the ground. Circles. Circles with symbols. The... the symbols alwayspointed towards the east. And I remember the night before it happened, I made circles in myfront yard, and something happened that never happened before And I remember a poem... a song. Yom sureth, yom azereth, yom belereth. Yom turkis, yom derth. OK, that's enough of that. But remember that. The poem is an incantation. We're going to need it. It says there's a road0.2 miles up on our left. But... I don't see it anywhere. MapQuest is never wrong. Maybe it's a private road? There! Doctor! Henry! Henry! Henry! I saw it. Henry! I saw its face. Can you hear me? - It looked at me. - It's OK. It's... No, it was inside my head! We're here. It showed me everything. He's in shock. I know. God, I know. Come on, Henry. Let's stand up. Caitlin, get a blanket. Henry? Henry. Where did it go? It's gone. To the world. What is it? I can't say. I can't speak its name. When you first came to me, you said that a portal had been opened. Yes. The guardian. The gate keeper is Yog-Sothoth? Is that who you saw? Yog-Sothoth controls and holdsopen the gates for the others. He has to grow until he's large enough to hold open the gates for eventhe greatest of the old ones. Did you see that ceiling? I mean, it looks pretty big. No. You're not getting it. He can't open the portal. Someone from our world has to open it. That's why Whateley wanted the book. He was going to open the portal. So the question is where did he go? Well, maybe he went home? He can't. The woman said it... Was Wilbur's brother. Her son. He can't go home. He is home. No. Now it's home. We're going to open the portal. What? Just long enough for it to take its position. Try and hold it open. Walter, if we open the portal... I know what the book says. That's why we have to close itbefore anything else comes out. If we open the portal, then... Then the older, stronger godsare gonna come into our world. We'll be powerless. I was wrong not to believe you. I should have trusted youand Henry this entire time. I was arrogant, and jealous. And I don't know what else, but it blinded me to something that I always knew was true. Now I'm asking you... Believe me. We can do this. How? Henry isn't strong enough to fight. I mean... he knows the ins and outs. The incantations. He has experience. And I've spent my entirelife alone in a library, obsessed with their books. I know them, too. I know they can be defeated. He's right. We have to try. Caitlin! Do you remember those circle drawings? - Yeah. - Good. As soon as we get outside, I need you to make one large enoughfor all four of us to stand in. As long as we're in thecircle, we should be safe. Yog-Sothoth! Yog-Sothoth, tu ra nan. Yog-Sothoth, tu ra nan! Yog-Sothoth! Help me! Help me! Don't let it take me! I'm not gonna let it take you! Don't let it take me! Help me! Help me! Don't let go! Dad! Now... Fay? Don't let go, Fay. God. Excuse me? Professor? I was wondering if I couldschedule some time with you during your office hours? Actually, my office hoursare all booked up this week. Dinner tonight, perhaps? I don't know. It hardly seems professional. No, I guess it's not very professional. 7:00? Perfect. I'll see you at 7:15. Today we're going todiscuss the concept of faith. Faith is a belief in power or powers that can actually alter human destiny. What? Dr. Rice, do you believe in such a power? Yes. Yes, I do.
