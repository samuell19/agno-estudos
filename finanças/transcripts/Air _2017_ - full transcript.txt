LUFT My little angel. There are guardian and fallen angels. Guardian angels love... ...fallen angels need to be protected. Yes, Babuschka. You've only got music on your mind. Do you always want to remind me of your father? Did you pick these before sunrise? Of course, Babuschka. What happened, Manja? What is there to laugh about? It doesn't matter what the others think about you. The main thing is that you're good. Can we be here? Of course, you can be here. Please tell Fadime. Good. Hello, Fadime. Ebru and Ilyas are with us. It's fine, Manja. Plastic, doctor. Plastic. Please breathe steadily. Well, if he doesn't want me to... I can't help him. Everything is broken, doctor. Medicine. The body is healthy. Do you understand? Medicine can help, but it can't heal. But doctor. Work gone. No sleep. No talking. No listening. Nothing. Just thinking about plastic. You can come along. I asked my parents. Our house is directly on the beach. Thanks. Only if you want to. Yes... You wanted to go to the seaside, didn't you? Yo, Smiley. Are you an adult now? Want one? Hey, dude. Gimme a cig. Give it back. Hey, chill. You scared, huh? Girl, chill. I'm not a "girl". It's cowardly to intimidate other people. Are you scared of being a "girl"? I'm not afraid of anything! Prove it! I'll lay down beneath a train. Deal! At the bridge! At eight! Louk? You can keep it. I don't need it anymore. The train has left. Nothing of us remains anyway. Just fear. And damage. Lies. It'd be so easy. To just not be afraid anymore. Not leave a trace. No more lies. Girl, stop this nonsense. Yo, Smiley. Yo, Igel. Now I know what it's like to be blind. Hey Smiley. A kiss for your glasses. C'mon, do it. - Kiss him. Quiet! There's absolutely no reason for this! You are all in detention! Except for Manja. And those who have gone after Manja, you'd better apologize. Now! We were only excited. See? It's all good. Relax. Bastian, get out of here. But I didn't do anything. Out. Now. Fucking women's lib! Anyone else want to go? Manja, you will stay after class. See you later! I can understand that you want to protect the others. But it's also important that you look after yourself. We were just having fun. It's nice that you think so. Not everybody does. It doesn't matter what the others think. Manja, there are many people who want to hurt others. Women especially need to be aware of who they can trust. We don't need to be afraid. Hello, Manja! Please come, we're starting soon. Come on. Oh, Babuschka. The flour just made everything worse, Mrs. Wolkow. What does he know about it? The things I've seen: Honey... Butter... Toothpaste... Does he believe I don't know how to help myself? Louk? Little angel, what would I be without my hands? Great pictures! Thanks! Stone is so fascinating to me. This mute material. That's an old bunker. That moss has grown into the concrete. Slight traces of history... Stone is the memory of time. We aren't quite finished. - That's all I needed. Little angel, can you bring me new ice packs? I'll be back soon, Babuschka. Child, why are you crying? Hello! Hi! Do you know where Louk is? Crazy Louk? In the hall! Which hall? You don't know the hall? Come along with Smart, everyone's taking part. Now? Chill! Smart! Manja! Every day, doing good: the credo of Smart. First kick a part, then rip the state apart. I'm Smart of the art, with a sick heart. Half-crazed, always dazed, wasn't well raised. My dad sent the psych and gave me a pill. Ever since never still, Smart's too ill. Kicked out of school, lives on public dimes. I only feel my life when I put it into rhymes. Running amok. Sorry, I have to take care of the little one. This is Manja. Hi, Manja! Yes! Here: "Inside". My favorite song. OK, let's do it! Throughout the whole barn: "Killing Factory". It's the bomb. There's a couple hundred pigs inside. Chrome, do the outlines. I'll do the fill-ins. Igel? We need a watcher. - Yo. Polle, you'll film. When are you going? No girls! It's not safe. Too dangerous. Why not free the pigs? Girl, calm down. We're going inside! Louk is so crazy I need a drag from my "hazy". Smart, shut it. No lies. No traces. No fear. Hello, Ebru. Can we be here? Of course, you can be here. What did Fadime say about it? And Tariq? We don't want to have a dad anymore. Ebru and Ilyas are with us. I can't do it anymore. Peace. Peace. My dear children. You can stay the night. Poor kids. Tariq is useless. Men...men are a curse. Mom, you're forgetting about love. What do you know about love? Your dad only loved music. Love isn't worth that. Mom? Men and worries, they go away. And what stays? Women and hope. I can't stay here. Not today. I have to work, Manja. Babuschka is here. But mom can't even look after herself. I'll go no matter what! What happened to you? Give me the key! Huh! Give me the key! Give...me...the key! Key. Please. Scaredy cat. It was all of us, understood? And not a word about my Louk! Everything OK? Who did this? There's nothing to see here! Get back in your classes. We're going to the aula! Get out of here! Not to the books. Get away! Come away from there. What are you doing here? Do you know who it was? Thanks! "Inside"! Wanna come? Your backpack. Hold on to me tightly. My favorite place. We're right at the border. France is down there. Beautiful. I hate being filmed. It's a guy thing. You have to leave something behind. So you can prove it. I don't want to leave anything behind. A couple thousand years ago... everything here was ocean. And in a thousand years, everything will return to the sea. Manja, come help me. Thanks. My grandmother says you're beautiful. Are you Manja's friend? Yes! Are you going to eat with us? You look hungry. No thanks. I have to go home, unfortunately. Have you ever tried Pelmeni? You have to try it. Manja would be really happy. We would all be really happy. Sorry. Nice family. Tariq. What a surprise. Come in. Thanks. Thank you. Very much. Come back home. Where's Louk? Yo, chill out. Is that Ewa? Hi! Let's go in the hall. Chill out. Yo, Junior, this is Ewa. I told you about her. The genius on the accordion. Check it out. Sit down and listen up. Get up, into the day, rise and shine. I bug the state like the state bugs the line. Don't swap with Smart. He's always the last part. He dives into the moment. Hypnotizing his opponent. A tinge of my soul, in the smoke of my throat. Believe what you see and put on your coat. Listen to the story, I'll plunge my quill into the blue of my ink and rob you of your will. You like it up there? You'll soon fall back to earth like the foliage of a tree: this is death and birth. Smart follows his heart while you follow the trend. But with every high comes a low in the next moment. Look above, see the dove? Out of the blue You'll have shit on your shoe. So, did you like it? Do you know where Louk is? Crazy Louk? Wait, I'll show you something! Here. Crazy Louk! Louk is pure madness. No one gets her... Wait. We've got lunch break. Please? I am sorry. What can I do for you? I'm looking for Louk. Oh, you know my daughter? Louk is my friend. I'm happy... to finally meet one of her friends! We're meeting up to eat. Maybe you'd like to come along? I brought your friend along. I see that, thanks. Hi, Manja. - Hello. It doesn't matter when I show up, you're always later! The usual, sir? I suggest... No meat! Perhaps your friend... - Just leave her. Do you know Luise from school? As well. - Louk! "Louk" - she got that from her mom. And where do you know each other from? I...I was at the doctor...and... There was your picture. So pictures can be good for something. Luise doesn't like photos. I have to use the bathroom. You coming? Two things about my father. First: He hates my mom because she left him. Second: He hates me because I'm like her. Why would he hate you? Because it's all his fault. What's his fault? That she went back to the ocean. I'm sorry. I'll bet you my dad's going to take a picture. But first of all he's not good at it, and second, he only wants to show himself that everything is ok. May I? You can't take good pictures while eating. What's so special about this moment? Every moment is special, my dear. Enjoy your meal. In Kazakhstan, they say... If you want to call someone to mind, then you should sing a song for her. And that song is only meant for her. She'll hear it and think of you. Like this? It has to be a personal song, that connects the two of you. All the plastic... gone. Nice, huh? Look. Love. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep, be still child's heart, sleep without your hat of worries. And dream of the world, that stirs deep within you. Awake, lovely child's heart, filled with the bravery of the morning. And look for the world, that stirs deep within you. Play, little child's heart, Play and be good. Forgive the world for the bloodshed. Don't worry, Manja. Should I understand this as an attack on the corrupt state, dear RAF-sympathizers? In the video that the parents of your colleague Pollinger gave me in deep sorrow, that their son filmed the attack and hasn't returned to school since, I am surprised by the radicalism of the act. This school is not a training camp for terrorists! And do you know how to fight terrorism? When the head rolls, the organs become innocuous! Mr. principal. We planned this and carried it out together. Mr. von Malst√§tt, Collegiality is in the tradition of our humanities high school and is continually stressed and rewarded. And so you should be expelled all together, just before your final exams. Unless... ...you want to rethink your solidarity. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Yours? Can we go now? Hello, Manja. Didn't Luise hear you? I don't think so. Because the music is too loud. Do you want to eat with us? I'd love to! Go on up to her. Upstairs, straight ahead. I'm not allowed in her room. Louk? Why did you lie? I want you to be fine. Do you think I'm better now? Enjoy your meal. "Corrupt state". No worries... What? I took care of it. You did what? I spoke with the principal. You're kidding. All's good. Nothing's good. You can't seriously believe that I would let you get kicked out of school. It's senseless. Luise... Louk... You disgust me. My little angel. My grandmother was an angel, like you. She always went hunting for mushrooms in the forest at the full moon. Because the mushrooms that we pick by moonlight are said to cure our worries. When I was your age, she took me with her. The forest was creepy and I was really afraid. I couldn't see anymore. My heart was beating so loudly, so wildly. But the forest was still, peaceful. And then I saw that the trees were waving at me. And my great-grandmother. And my great-great-grandmother. And all my ancestors were at home here. My little angel. We are never alone. The souls of the dead are alive in the trees. Hey! Let's go to the party. Crazy Mania! What's up? What a move! Whoa, careful! I'll go grab new ones, OK? Here. Vodka Soda. You know, my credo is: It's not important what you do if you have a message. And your message is good. Every person is good. And you especially? No. Every person wants to be good. Bullshit. Then the world would just get better. Shut up! - What's this about, girl? Am I good? Yes. Do you think I need you? Want a Smartie? Ciao, bella, ciao! Tariq. I'm sorry. Eat it, my child. Come back, little angel. Sorry. That wasn't very sensitive. Luise has a photophobia ever since her mother's been gone. How do you cure a photophobia? Well... It was tough for her. She was just 10. At that age, you can't understand when your mother just disappears. You think, she needs a bit of time to herself. Then you get a phone call from the French Gendarmerie. That they've found her air mattress. They say Marie swam out to sea. That's it. And you have to accept that. Existence hurts. Pain is part of life. It doesn't stop when you go. You just pass it on to those you've left behind. I'm hungry. Thanks. Nothing but music on your mind. Girl, what has happened to your hair? Come on, eat with us. I'm going to the seaside. I want to see my mom again. I'm coming along. Yes. You will always be in my heart. We're turning around. What? Forget it. It was a bad idea. No! It's good! I'm sorry. We can do it. What? Let go. Hello. Good. Will you play something for me? Wake up. Let's go. I want to go to the seaside today. I'm staying here.
