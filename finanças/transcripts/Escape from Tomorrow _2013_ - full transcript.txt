Siemens. The enterprise which sponsors this attraction. (ALARM BEEPING) Computer, begin the scan. (SCREAMING) You've got quite an imagination! Just like old W himself. He died... while all this was still in its early stages. Epcot's real purpose remains unfinished. (VOICE DISTORTED) You're inside my head! Not your head, Jim. In your imagination. But we don't want to control it like they do. We simply monitor things, so we can know what they're up to and keep tabs. (DISTORTED VOICE) Who is that? That's you. What?! Only that's the real you, in a part of your imagination you've never sought to use. Turn it off, please! Please! Somethings not right. Didn't your boss relay the message when you spoke to him? My boss? What are you talking about? He was instructed to remind you... you were to take the boy. And Security was to meet you, after the ride, at the Land Pavilion. Do you know how much depends on this?! We even had to shut down the Buzz Lightyear! Excuse me for a moment. (DOORS WHOOSHING) Geosporic. MAN ON MONITOR: Oh, yeah, yeah, it's over there.

Have you even seen someone decapitated? - What? - It's not like in the movies. That's a pretty dress. It happens here, occasionally. Last time on Thunder Mountain. I can't feel my teeth. People just come here 'cos they wanna feel safe. They're afraid! But you can't escape it, you know. Bad things happen everywhere. Especially here. - You're a witch. - No! I'm a princess. Or at least, I used to be. Happy day all of you! I love you! I'm so happy to be here with you! My beautiful princes and princesses! Hello, Princess Minnie, you beautiful angel. Keep smiling. Another beautiful princess. Hello darling. I used to be one of them a long time ago. Back when I was young and beautiful. And it was magical. 'Til one day I saw this little girl. She was so perfect, like your daughter. Like Sara? So I wrapped my arms around her. But then something happened. When you're a princess, they teach you to smile. Be cheery, merry, jovial. And you can never be sad. Never ever! Then something happened. I couldn't let go. Help! I can't breathe! (NECK BREAKS) Oh no, princesses must never cry! Hey, what are you doing to my daughter?! - Let go of her! - Stop it! Hey, what's wrong with you? Let her go! But you can't be happy all the time. It's just not possible. And you know smiling's not good... for the wrinkles. And I hate happy endings. Hate's a bad word! (GLASS SHATTERING) That's mine! You're sick, you know that?! Haven't you ever had a fantasy, Jim? Daddy, let's go home. Thank you for playing with me, Sara. You're a very sweet little girl. - Like a princess? - Yes, darling... wait! Your balloon! - You don't want to forget it. - Look daddy!
