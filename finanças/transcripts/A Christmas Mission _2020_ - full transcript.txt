[Liz sighs] How is it that even when I'm exactly on time, I still feel like I'm late? You can blame the general for that. -[Sighs] -Coffee's on the counter. Mm. Thank you. How is the old general? I am sure my dad is fine. He's keeping busy with his autobiography. -[Cell phone vibrating] -Right. The guy's gotta have a bug in my phone. Every time I mention his name, he calls. I will call you back in a bit. [Gasps] Bad daughter. -What? I will call him back. -Hm, you better. Will you help me with these? I don't know where to put them. Mm. Which wall? The east wall, with great sun. Kate will want to take pictures to showcase on her website. -Potentially. -"Potentially." Kate margulies is a design goddess. I mean, if she did a little blurb on her show, that kind of exposure, that could really make a difference for our artisans and get the shop properly launched. Em, her whole brand is her love for things handcrafted and off the beaten path, and that's us. And, hopefully, she can create a little buzz for our Christmas Eve extravaganza, because last I checked, we had a grand total of six RSVPs. -And that's including us. -Don't worry. Everybody loves a Christmas Eve party. But you're gonna miss your dad. Can we please not talk about this? Honestly, after Thanksgiving, I don't know if I have it in me. "Are you earning enough money? Are you putting some away? Are you dating? Are you getting out there? Are you having fun? Are you thinking about your own family?" Liz, I might have to have kids just to give my dad something to do. Plus, it's just not Christmas without my mom. I know, em. I'm sorry. Anyway, I plan to work through Christmas and maybe I'll go see my dad for new year's. But don't you think your dad w... Silver or gold? The greatest debate of our time. I've been putting a lot of thought into this. You putting in a lot of thought into something? No. [Chuckles] Okay. Silver people are silver people, right? They have it in their homes, their jewelry. They have silver tinsel, silver garland, picture frames. And gold people, gold people are exactly the same with their gold, you'll never see silver on gold people because they love their gold. So the question is, what is Kate? Silver or gold? You really did over-think this. Wait, what if she's a silver and a gold person? I actually think she's a platinum person. What does that even mean? It means we don't take any chances and we go with hand-blown glass. Because you cannot go wrong with hand-blown glass. Mm-hmm. [Instrumental music] That doesn't look any good. [Cell phone vibrating] It's the general. He's texting me. "Do we usually put the garland or the lights on first?" Okay, in what world do you start with garland? Yeah, no world I'd want to live in, that's for sure. Am I right? Okay. I better call this man back before he hurts himself. -Mm-hmm. -[Sighs] [Line ringing] [Cell phone ringing] And stay. There she is! [Chuckles] Hi, dad. Let me get you set up. Good morning. I got your text. I see you're putting up the Christmas decorations. Well, trying. I'm not very good at the, uh, inside stuff. Don't you remember mom's jingle anagram thing? ♪ Let's go on adventures ♪ ♪ lights garland ornaments angel ♪ Ugh, I skipped a step. I better write this down. A-And don't worry, Emma. I'm saving the angel for when you're home. I know how you love to put it up just right. -Uh, dad, s... -First the lights... Dad, I have to tell you that, um... Then the garland. I don't have garland, but I have this ribbon. Dad, I'm not gonna be able to make it home for Christmas this year, we're having an event at the store, and it kinda has to be on the 24th, so... What kind of an event has to be on Christmas Eve? Well, a very, very important one. This store really needs the publicity, and it's gonna be for a good cause, so.. Sure. I know you're disappointed. I'm sorry. -But you get it, right? -Oh, yeah. It's not e day you get to promote local arts and charity on Christmas Eve. -It's artisa, -oh, right. , I-I know is our first year without mom and... -[Liz] Em? -Um... Dad, I'm so sorry, but I, uh, I have to go. I have to go. Can we talk later? Please? Um, we have an important visitor coming. But listen, I promise I will be there for new year's. ? Love you. New year's would be wonderful, sweetheart. Love you, too. Bye. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bye. [Engine revving] [Car door opens and shuts] [Tom] Are my eyes going or is that staff sergeant Aaron Parker I see? Sir, yes, sir, general. Ma just picked me up from the station. At ease, sergeant. At ease. It's actually master sergeant now. Well done, parks. U. -It's good to see you, general. -You, too, Aaron. -How long's your leave? -Permanent. -I'd love a coffee. -How do you take it? Master sergeant? So you got a job lined up yet? [Chuckles] No, no job yet. How about a girlfriend? -No, girlfriend. -Well, what are your plans now? I'm not exactly sure yet. You know how it is in the service. You get your sense of purpose. I just wanna stay busy. I don't know, maybe I'll start my autobiography like you. Oh. You heard about that, huh? My mom sent me the gazette. Any tips? -Hire a ghost writer. -[Laughs] And live a little more life on the other side first. I don't know, I think the first thing I wanna do is help you get this tree decorated. You don't have to worry about that. I'll get it done by Christmas. I-I have a book draft due by then... No, no, no, I'm gonna grab these lights, you get these ornaments, and we'll get workin' on it. [Aaron chuckles] I remember this year. Oh, yeah. Who could forget that one? Emma and I thought we would cook Christmas dinner that year, we put the ham in the oven, decided to go ice-skating. But you never took the ham out of the oven. -Hams-plosion! -Hams-plosion! Yeah. That oven's never been quite the same. -Yeah, sorry about that. -Eh, you were kids. So, uh, your first Christmas home in quite a while, huh? Yeah, first one since I enlisted, I think. I've been counting down the days to the king family Christmas traditions. Hey, you wanna get a kick start on the season and start caroling? No. No one wants to hear me sing. -[Laughs] -That was always Annie and Emma. And now without Annie... Very sorry for your loss, general. I know this Christmas is gonna be different without Mrs. King. Hey, maybe you and I can build a gingerbread house together. I'm giving it a good try, but, uh, I'm not much in the Christmas spirit this year, especially since Emma's not coming home and... What, Emma's not coming home for Christmas this year? I was assuming she'd be here. She has a big work event in the city she's running and... We've had a tough go without Annie. You know, she, she really kept us all together and... -Is there anything I can do? -I appreciate that, son. But there's really nothing to be done. So Emma's in the city now, huh? What, did she go corporate or something? Emma? No. She opened her own artsy home-goods shop. You haven't been in touch with her? No, it must be amazing, her shop. [Tom] It sounds like it, i-i actually haven't had a chance to get there, and Emma hasn't e-exactly extended an invitation, so... All the more reason why she should come home for Christmas. I'd give anything for her to be here for Christmas. But it's not in the cards this year. Well, maybe I'll make it my mission. -What now? -I'll go to the city. I'll get Emma and I'll bring her home for Christmas. Oh, really? Have you met the will of Emma? That's a good point. Have you met me? It's okay. There'll be other Christmases. Hey, listen, you shouldn't be alone for Christmas, and neither should Emma. I'll go to the city. I'll get Emma and I'll bring her back for Christmas. That's a promise. Good luck with that, son. [Liz] Oh, so excited! [Emma] I hope she likes it. [Liz] She's gonna love it. Oh! Here she comes. Oh. Hello, ladies! Kate Margulies. Hi. I am so excited to meet you. -I'm... -Emma king. Emma the great. Emma the magnificent, Emma the artiste. And I'm her business partner, Liz. Ah, yes, Liz! A true pleasure. Your store is absolutely perfect. I love everything about this space. And every piece is created by an independent artisan and designer? -Mm-hmm. -Ah. I love it. Hm. Look at this! Ah! A true revelation. And this one is just... ah... -Ooh! Are you okay? -What's wrong? That painting, the way the light hits, it's, it's perfect. Oh. Thank you. -Emma made it. -[Gasps] I mean, yes, a-a while ago now. Emma king, the artiste! [Camera clicking] Okay, now get in. Oh, okay. -[Camera clicking] -Great. Now, Emma king, tell me, what other magnificence of yours is on display here? -Oh. Uh, none, actually. -None? Uh, well, uh, being the owner, I'm mostly curating. Emma's had a bit of a creative hiatus. Oh, I see. Mm-mm-mm-mm... Okay, that one for the big promo night. Wait, does that mean that you'll be attending our Christmas Eve event? Attending? I'm going to be hosting it! If that's okay with you. Oh, yes, this has Kate Margulies written all over it. -Hosting? -Absolutely! It'll be all about you and these four walls. But you want people to attend, right? So it'll be a little bit about me. -Of course. -[Both] Of course. And you're still thinking you want an altruistic element to it? -That was our plan. -Good, giving! Ah. Now, we need to come up with, uh, an official kick-off. -[Gasps] A pop-up! -A pop-up? Yes! Tomorrow afternoon! We'll keep it simple, you know? Wine, cheese and these four walls. And Kate! Invite all your favorite artisan friends to participate on Christmas Eve. And, Emma, creative hiatus is over! -You have to share your work. -Oh, I don't really think... Now here's my plan, the Christmas Eve extravaganza will be a showcase, mm, a challenge, mm, a philanthropic enterprise! Ooh! And, of course, a celebration of designers, inspirations, and the true meaning of Christmas! -And tomorrow is... -Tomorrow we promo! We announce the charity and what the challenge will be. Emma, what should they create? Oh. Um, well, what if everyone created the same thing? -Yes! -Um... Everyone presents their own interpretation of the spirit of Christmas. Perfect! I love it! Everyone creates based on the same idea. And tomorrow we'll let the community choose what the artisans will make. Hm? -Phone, please. Thank you. -Oh. Now, I am posting to my site and my socials now! Expect a crowd! And, Emma... I'm expecting an outstanding entry from you. It might secure a segment on my show. But let's not top the gun. [Indistinct chatter] Hm. Now, ladies, until tomorrow. Kisses! -[Liz] Ooh. -What just happened? -She said tomorrow. -Yeah. Okay. We have work to do, that's fine, we're fine. We can do it. [Liz] Wine and cheese. ♪ It's Christmas time in the city ♪ ♪ the streets are plagued with gold ♪ ♪ I look around it's so pretty ♪ ♪ but I still feel alone ♪ ♪ if I could make it home... ♪ Hi. Need a hand? Well, that's really sweet of you to offer, Cuz, but we both know you don't mean it. -How you doin'? All right. -Good. Come in. So you got to explain this mission of yours. You were being so cagey on the phone. I'm here to bring Emma king home for Christmas. Emma? The girl you've never gotten over since high school. What are you talking about? Who said that? -Ah. Oh. -Mm-hmm. Yeah. There it is. "E plus a equals heart." Yeah, you are totally over her. My bad. Mm. Will you stop it? I like the craftsmanship. Emma is my neighbor, her father's a five-star general who wants to see his daughter for Christmas. -And I'm gonna make it happen. -How is my auntie? She's onboard with you spending time on this mission? She's good and she knows it's the season of giving. And if my giving happens to translate into reliving some childhood Christmas memories, then so be it, call it a bonus. And seeing Emma. You're such a giver. So why doesn't Emma wanna visit this magical Christmas wonderland? It's complicated. Her mother passed away earlier this year. But wouldn't she wanna be with her dad? Or is she avoiding? I think there's more to it than that. Emma and her father have an interesting relationship. They're kinda like two sides of the same coin, fused together, but can never see the other side. See, when Emma was a little girl, she used to get so excited when her father would come home on leave, she would organize everything and present him with everything that he missed. And it was cool when we were kids, but as she got older, you know, things shifted. Ah, yeah, a dad that can't handle their child turning into adult? I understand that. Well, you know, it can be tough being in the military. Every time you come home, you gotta get reacquainted. It can be lonely. I don't think Mr. King ever figured out how to reconnect with Emma. And you getting involved is a good idea because... Because I can bridge the gap. Be like a Christmas miracle-worker. Yeah, because you're just so charmingly disarming. -Hey, you said it, not me. -So what's your plan? You have a, you have a plan. -Right? -I got somethin'. [Instrumental music] Hey, you know, Sarah, I got a bad, I got a bad feeling about this, this was a bad idea, we should get outta here. Well... -We shouldn't be here. We need... -Stop. -Well, you come with me... -Stop it. You dragged me here, and I'm not leaving until I get some brie in my belly. So go, go find your Mark or whatever. [Emma] Aaron Parker? [Instrumental music] Emma king? Wow. Wow! Uh, what are you... How, how are you doing? Uh, I, uh... I'm, uh, I'm well. I'm good. Um, what... Hey, em, love the spread. Sarah? Hi. It's so good to see you. Wow! Um... Okay, what are you doing here? Well, I finished in the service, I came off my last tour and I wanted to spend time with my favorite cousin before Christmas. Okay. Sure. I meant more like, um, why are you here right now in my store. Oh, here? Oh, well, uh... Sarah got a post about it and thought it'd be fun. I didn't even know this was your shop. I'm as shocked as you are. Did you know that this was Emma's place? Is this another one of your crazy jokes? S-See that, she's always joking. That's me. The comedian. Uh... I, um... -[Chuckles] I have to go. -Oh. -Smooth. Real smooth. -Hi, Emma king! [Aaron] Yeah. Who's that? -Kate Margulies. -Who? Kate Margulies, the queen of divine design. Hi. Hi. Kate Margulies. She's an entrepreneur and interior designer. Ooh, on her show they do those home-decor makeovers. You know, you really need to get with this century. You're 30, not 70. -Hm, is that... -Yup. -Why is he? -Don't know. Hm. Hey, not to sound too cheesy, but that plate looks so Gouda. [Chuckles] Ba-ram-pum-chee... That was the worst joke I've ever heard. -I Camembert it. -[Laughs] These puns are so bad, I'm feeling blue. -Blue cheese. -N-No, we got it. -Cheddar luck next time. -Nicely done. Are you a featured artist here? Oh, if you think doing math is art, then, yes. Um, but I'm Liz, I'm Emma's business partner. -Oh. -Okay. We own the shop together. Sarah. Expert cheese-stacker. And you run the community kitchen? Yeah. Yeah, I thought you looked familiar. I stopped by last month to drop off a few pieces on loan, but I didn't have the pleasure of meeting you. I really love what you are doing over there. Thank you. You know, we're always looking for extra help. And it's a great way of fostering community. -[Chuckles] -Hm. Hi, I'm Aaron. -Oh, this is my cousin. -Oh, your cousin? I've heard all about you, Aaron. I'm the business partner and best friend. So whatever you're here for, play nice. -Oh, yeah, of course... -Hi! Hello! Thank you so much for being here. I am Emma king. And I am the co-owner of these four walls. -Whoo! -[Emma] Thank you. Thank you all so much for being here and being at our pop-up. My business partner Liz and I are so thrilled that you're here and we hope that you'll come back Christmas Eve and maybe bring a friend or five. Um, I know that so many of you heard about our Christmas Eve extravaganza on social media. So without further ado, please welcome the queen of divine design, Kate Margulies! -[Applause] -Whoo-Hoo! Kate! Thank you, Emma. Hello, everyone! Oh, what an incredibly creative community! The love and magic here on display at these four walls is simply perfection. Now, let's get down to business. Where are my creators? Ah, are you ready to hear what this whole Christmas Eve extravaganza is all about? -Whoo! -Yes! [Kate] My five artists will take on the challenge of capturing the spirit of Christmas in one single piece of design. They will all have the same prompt. The question is, what shall it be? Y-You... I'm asking you what should it be. [Gasps] What should they create? -Santa. -Okay. I don't love it. -What else? -Ornaments? Hm, don't hate it. Oh. Hello, handsome. No, it's you... -Oh. Uh, hello. -Hm. What do you think the artists should create? Um, what about a wreath? That I love! A wreath symbolizes the Christmas season without being too obvious or too commercial like Santa. No offense. Okay, creators, you have your wreath assignments. Design it. Construct it. Sell it. But because Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without philanthropy, where should we donate? -The community kitchen. -The community kitchen. Wow! Two votes. Okay, the community kitchen! Any objections? Perfect! Creators, create. Everyone else, come back Christmas Eve ready to open up those wallets at the silent auction and take home what, I am certain, will be unique and stunning Christmas wreaths. -Let's clap for me! -[Laughter] [Instrumental music] So this was pretty crazy, huh? Uh, yeah, that's the word for it. You know, I wanted to tell you, your family was the inspiration for my, uh, wreath suggestion. Okay. [Aaron] When I was little, every year Thanksgiving night I would look out my bedroom window at the front door, there'd be this big beautiful wreath with all these decorations, and I knew it was Christmas. Are you mad at me? Uh, I'm confused. Okay, well, I was just visiting town to see my cousin and, uh... Actually, actually, I am mad. I haven't heard from you in years, and now you just drop in, acting like nothing's happened. You broke my heart, Aaron. Did you think reminiscing about my family's wreath was gonna fix all that? -No. I was... -Don't. Don't do that. It's too late. It took me years to get over losing you. And I am not about to reopen those wounds. [Emma sighs] Happy holidays. [Ms. Stewart] I cried during the chapter in the bunker. It felt like I was there. I was scared, I was lonely. It was great. But the chapters with your family felt quite thin in comparison. Really? I... I tried to give equal space to my military and civilian life. Taking three pages to explain that you played pin the tail on the donkey at your daughter's sixth birthday wasn't exactly riveting. I can trim it. Trim the fat, yes, but add more meat. Give me that same emotion you gave in the chapter where you enlisted. I know more about the private on the bus that you never saw again than I do about your own daughter. -I don't know her at all. -Okay. I see. You don't hate him. No. I don't hate him. But I don't wanna see him. I don't know him anymore. Maybe Aaron's trying to make amends. It's not like he was on vacation this entire time. I mean, he did serve in Honolulu. -Really? Really? -[Emma chuckles] No, he was not on vacation. Listen, I know. I know it's all history, long ago and far away, but... but it still stings. And I wish I wasn't so angry at someone for doing something selfless like serving their country. But I cannot get him out of my mind. And I need to focus, I need to concentrate. [Aaron] I've got to concentrate on how to get on her good side. She's clearly not happy about my unannounced visit. Why don't you just tell her why you're here? Oh, yeah, "hey, em, I'm here to bring you home so that your father won't be lonely and we can celebrate the holidays like we always did as kids." -It just sounds... -Selfish? If you saw the look of disappointment on her father's face, you wouldn't say it was selfish. Just got to lay some groundwork. I'll invite her to my soup kitchen. She'll say no to anything you suggest. Who can say no to helping people in need? -That's perfect! -I'll text Liz. -Who's Liz? -Emma's business partner. The cheese-pun queen. -You got her number? -That I did. [Emma] Lots of fun, a splash of color. Nobody wants a sad wreath. Okay, giggles. Share. Share. What's so funny? Did you get another outlandish quote from a caterer? No. A text from Sarah. Sarah? Aaron's cousin Sarah? She wants us to go to the community kitchen. Us? No. Why? Is Aaron gonna be there? Um, I don't think so. If Aaron truly is not gonna be there, I'm in. [Upbeat music] -[Emma] What is he doing here? -I don't know. -Mm-hmm? -[Sarah] Liz? Meats and vegetables with me. I feel like I can't escape people barking orders at me. Remember, smiles till the door closes. These are our guests. -[Woman] Oh. -Hi, guys. Welcome to community kitchen. Come on in. When I serve the potatoes, you want me to put a little well in it so you can pour your gravy into it? Well or mound, either way I'll adapt. -Ooh. -You want gravy today? Of course you do. -[Indistinct chatter] -I love that coat. -I'm really glad you came. -Thanks. I'm happy to be here. [Indistinct chatter] -Hey. Am I too late? -[Liz] Oh. Not at all. Like some ham? -Yes, please. -[Sarah] Enjoy. -You serve? -Did you serve? -Yeah. With honor. -Oh, good. You're serving now. -I-I forgot his coffee, so... -Okay. She, she's new. Looks like we're running low on ham. Oh, we should probably get some more. Oh, I can take over. This here is my good friend Leroy the Christmas rabbit. Say "merry Christmas." Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. All right, we gotta get back to work. ♪ It's Christmas yeah yeah ♪ ♪ oh yeah yeah yeah yeah ♪ ♪ it's Christmas ♪ Uh, he gave you latrine duty, four nights in a row? You bet I never argued with the drill instructor after that. [Laughing] So how have you been doing? Oh, you know, just adjusting. -Friend of yours? -Yeah, well, yeah... Yeah, something like that. It's complicated. Can I get you anything else, sir? Uh, no, thank you. Charlie, this is my friend Emma. Emma, this is my friend Charlie, sergeant first-class. Oh? It's a pleasure to meet you. And thank you so much for your service. Now don't let this one get away. Okay, I'll be sure to remember that. -Charlie? -Hey, you're welcome. I got it. Okay. Thanks. -Take that, too. -[Chuckles] Okay. [Instrumental music] [Emma] I'm so glad that they at least have this. And you were great with him. It was nice to see you guys laughing. Well, you know, everybody deserves respect and good conversation. Nobody should be alone for the holidays. You know what I mean? I know it's hard to come home after serving for so long. You doing okay? [Sighs] Yeah, I’m, I'm all right, just aside from the fact that I don't know what I'm doing with the rest of my life. Other than that, I'm good. Do you, um, you still design, you work with metal still? [Scoffs] No. I mean, I did a few drawings while I was on tour, but that's about it. That's too bad. You were great. Well, I don't know if I'd say all that. I was okay for a high-school student. But you, you, you were amazing. I mean, you, you were incredible. -[Chuckles] I wouldn't say that. -I would. You were always the best at everything. And look at you now, you own a shop. You're hosting a fundraiser that's gonna help more guys like Charlie, you're creating a unique piece for the showcase. -What? That look. -What? What look? -I know that look. Yeah. -I don't have a look. I-don't-know-if-I’m-gonna-get- my-assignment-done-in-time look. What? No. No. You about to give up? No. What? No. It's just, um... [Sighs] There's a lot to get done. -Well, I'll help you. -No, thank you. Yeah, me and, me and Sarah will both help you so that you can concentrate on creating your masterpiece. [Chuckles] Masterpiece? Okay. Wow. No pressure. Well, it's not gonna be a masterpiece if we don't help. Look, I know what you said the other day, and, you know, I've thought about it, but for while I'm here, I wanna be able to help. You know, even if it's just the grunt work, you know, move heavy furniture or... Take out the trash or clean the toilets, whatever you need, I'll, I'll-I'll do that. [Chuckles] -Clean the toilets? -Yeah. That's, um, an offer a girl can't refuse. Look, Aaron, I know that you're trying, and I get it, but it's just not that simple. You can't just offer to help and have everything be magically fixed. "When did you break your arm?" Dad. Ah. I'll just call him. Yeah. [Line ringing] Emmy-bean! So-so how old were you when you broke it? Well, I broke my arm twice, so... -You did? -[Emma] I did. Oh, right. S-So, d-did you break it playing baseball? -I didn't. No. -[Tom] You didn't? I broke my arm once when I was eight, falling off my bike, and then I broke it again when I was 12, skiing. -You weren't playing baseball? -I never played baseball. No? Well, I could have sworn th... I mean, I played softball for one year. Okay, so you were eight and it was your right arm? It was the left arm. I guess I shouldn't write about it if I don't remember it, huh? Well, you weren't home for either hospital visits, so... -Thank goodness for mom. -Thank goodness for mom. Uh, so h-how did your, uh, event thing go yesterday? [Sighs] Yeah. Fine, fine. Actually, you will never believe who showed up there. Oh, e-Emmy, uh, i-I've gotta, I've gotta go. It's my publisher. Uh, tell me later, okay? -Uh, yeah, we'll talk later. -Bye.

Yeah. -Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay, well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do that. You got this. [Exhaling sharply] Okay. Okay. You're still here. Where are the girls? Uh, Sarah's locking up the kitchen, Liz went with her. You wanna get something to eat? I can't take a break from accomplishing absolutely nothing. Well, you know, fulfilling your body's basic need for nourishment is never a break. You know we ate in the army, right? Are you trying to say that creating a wreath for your local showcase is not as important as serving your country? Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying. [Chuckles] Well, then we are in agreement. Okay, good. -Fine. A quick bite. -Okay. Do you wanna change first or... No, you know what, you look, you look great. In fact... [Laughs] Why would you do that? Solidarity. You know I'm gonna change, right? -Oh, you are gonna change? -Uh-huh. Okay, well, maybe I should get cleaned up then, too. We'll go? ♪ Well Santa don't you take too long ♪ -I thought we were getting food. -Yeah, but this is fun, right? A little physical exercise so you could help clear your mind? You know, feel the cold breeze on your face. -It's inspirational! -Uh-huh. I'm inspired. I'm inspired to eat because I'm starving. Okay, well, I hear they got great hot dogs here. Really? Well, I hear they got hot dogs here. Come on, I'll get you some hot chocolate. Okay, but if they don't have the mini marshmallows, I'm out. They better have some mini marshmallows. [Chuckles] I cannot believe you don't remember the first time we went ice-skating, hey, I fell so many times, I could've swore that'd be etched in your memory. You're absolutely sure that it wasn't Tara roper's birthday party? -Before that. -Before that? We just started dating right before her party. I didn't say we were dating. I said the first time we went skating. Boo! It's a trick question. Um, okay, ah, I know. It was sixth grade trip to the common pond. Before that. Your mom took us skating when we were like six or seven. Yeah, we were decorating the Christmas tree. I broke one of her hand-painted ornaments. I felt so bad about it, I picked up the pieces, stuffed 'em in my pocket, I look up, and your mom's looking right at me. She walks over to me, gives me a big hug and says, "it's okay." I didn't know you broke one of her ornaments. Yeah, she took us skating so I wouldn't worry about it. Got us hot chocolate. She always knew how to make everything better. Yeah. Everything but my skating. So do you still go skating at the indoor rink at the mall every season? Not after my mom got sick. Whenever she took me there, they'd play her holiday album. I didn't wanna go without her. I'm sorry if bringing you here was... No, it's, uh, it's okay. She loved Christmas so much... At this time of year, she's, uh... She's everywhere. I'm really sorry, Emma. Your mother was a great woman. You know, when my dad left when I was a kid, I had a handful of photos to remember him by, but, I mean, that's it. It's not the same thing. I can't imagine what you're going through. I'm really sorry. Thanks, parks. So you're really not gonna go home for Christmas? I can't. I can't. Be there without my mom? And the general, he's watching my every move. And I love my dad, I love my dad so, so much, but... He just doesn't get me. I am... I mean, I'm a designer. I'm an artist. And when I’m creating, there's no set rules. No set hierarchy, no set schedule. And I don't, I don't think he can understand that. Well, he's working on his autobiography, right? I mean, that's, that's pretty creative. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. But when it's just the two of us, I immediately turn into that 14-year-old girl. I am slamming bedroom doors and rolling my eyes. And neither of us needs a Christmas like that. -I kinda liked 14. -Oh, yeah? Yeah. Kissed you for the first time at 14. Fall festival. It was really awkward, you remember that? [Laughing] Yeah, you do. You remember that. [Laughs] Why don't we go for one last lap before we leave? -Okay, but only one. -All right. [Emma chuckles] [Instrumental music] -Oh! -Ooh! I got you. Uh... It's, um, it's getting late. I should, um, go lock myself back in my studio. Okay, sure. But thank you for a much-needed break. Pleasure's all mine. Um, are you up for coming by the studio tomorrow afternoon? I mean, you've been a big help. -I'd love to. -Okay. Most parents list the birth of their child as the most significant event of their life. And the day my Emmy-bean came into the world was no different. But I wasn't in the delivery room wearing a hospital gown. I was wearing my fatigues in the middle of a Kuwait army base when I got the call announcing her birth. Too often, my wife had to do life's hard work without me beside her. I wish I could have seen the strength in Annie's eyes. I wish I could have held Emma that very day. I wish I could have been the first one to say her name. Instead, I received photos and only met my Emmy-bean months later. When I met her, she was a completely different baby than the infant whose pictures I had looked at every day. She made eye contact, she smiled and cooed... And cried the first time she saw me. I was a stranger. [Instrumental music] [Tom on recorder] Most parents list the birth of their child as the most significant event of their life. And the day my Emmy-bean came into this world was no different. Well, what do you want? That's the thing. I don't know what I want. I don't know how to feel about any of it. -Do you like that he's here? -I didn't, but now... -So? -So it's not that easy. When we were together before, a long time ago... It was amazing, it was so great. He was practically part of my family. But then he basically disappeared until the other day. Have you asked him why he left without saying anything? Well, no, it hasn't really come up. Well, maybe it should. All right, I see you, smarty-pants. -How's it going with Sarah? -Hm, great. Like, really great. Yeah, she's smart and kind. Oh, funny. Just hilarious. Beautiful. She's so talented and she's a really good person. Maybe she's too good for me. What? No. No! Nobody is too good for you. I'm sure she snores or has a weird toe nail, or doesn't like pizza or something. But at least we know that she has really good taste. -Thank you. -Mm-hmm. She better like pizza. I eat a lot of pizza. Ah. What are you making? I didn't know you knew how to knit. Well, clearly, I don't. It was supposed to be like an ugly Christmas hat-wreath. -[Mumbles] -Ugly, yes. Wreath, no. -That's rude! That was rude! -Just trying to be honest. -That was rude! -[[Indistinct] -[Laughing] -[Emma gasps] How about snow-angel wreath? -[Liz] Oh. -Snow-angel wreath? Yeah, I was wondering what all of this was. These are all my failed attempts. Oh, I thought the stationery sort of threw up. -[Woman] Hello! -I'll be right with you. Saved by the customer. [Instrumental "Carol of the bells"] [Instrumental music] [Humming "silent night"] [Kate] Okay, a tiny bit higher. A, a tiny bit higher. Higher. A little higher. And... oh. Don't move a muscle. All right, how's it lookin' back there, Ms. Kate? Oh, it's looking real good. [Clears throat] Great, thank you. So, is he single? Uh, yeah, as far as I know, he is single. Really? What's wrong with him? Nothing. He's great. -Oh, a-a-are you two... -Oh. No, no, nope. -[Sarah clears throat] -Okay. And you? Yeah, he's my cousin. It's usually frowned upon. For him I might make an exception. -[Kate chuckles] -And Liz? Yeah. He's not exactly her type. Interesting. Very interesting. Okay! It's time for the big reveal! [Aaron] All right. [Emma] All right. [Gasps] Ee! Be honest. Isn't it great? Yeah, it's, uh, it's eye-catching. [Aaron] I can't look away. Yeah. Me neither. [Sniffing] -You all right? -Mm. Mm. Got to go. Ahem. [Chuckles] Looks like someone has an admirer. -Is that what that was? -Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that's good to know. Come in! -Hi. -I come... Bearing Christmas-themed distractions. Please tell me that you do not travel with these on you at all times. I might. I might. No, I just grabbed these at the grocery store. This is all they had. So, uh, you're not going out with Kate? Are you kidding me? That woman, she terrifies me. Not in a powerful-women- intimidate-me kind of way, but more of a tighten-your-belt- and-batting-down-the-hatches kind of way, you know what I mean? -Sure. -Yeah. So, which is it gonna be? I mean, I feel like we can't go wrong with romance and reindeer, right? I'm with that. [Sighs] I'm gonna go, uh, get the popcorn. I-I will hang my coat. Yeah. [Instrumental music on TV] You know, I’m-I'm no expert on magical Christmas reindeer. -But... -No? I don't think that's supposed to be falling out of the sky... No! I don't think so either. [Both laughing] You want to wait and watch the blooper reel? Mm-hmm, yeah, I always wait till the end of the credits. -[Laughs] -Yeah. I feel like this entire movie was a, a big blooper reel. -No! Really? -Mm-hmm. Reindeer bloop after reindeer bloop. [Laughing] [Aaron laughs] -You okay? -Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's fine. Doesn't seem like everything's fine. Uh, well, um... What is this? Yeah, I know, it-it was a bad movie. Aaron? Not the movie. -What is this? -What? We're ice-skating, we're watching romantic movies. Yeah. It's like no time has passed. But it has. A lot of time has passed. Okay. Do you wanna talk about it? Um... All right, let's talk about it. Let's finally talk about what happened 12 years ago. -Why did you disappear? -I didn't disappear. I enlisted. Right, my dad drove you to the recruitment office, neither of you told me about it, and then two weeks later you disappeared. Okay, you're right, I... I wish I did some things differently. That's true. One day we were going to design school and then the next... No, you were going to design school. I didn't get in. Wait. What? Yeah, I didn't get in. The only reason why I wanted to go to school was to be with you. It was the only place I applied. So once I didn't get in, that was it. Why didn't you just tell me? I don't know. I was young and dumb. I was afraid of losing you. Then it became quite evident that I was. So, I... I froze. I was scared. And joining the army seemed like a less scary choice? [Scoffs] Actually, yeah. Yeah, it was. After we graduated, I had nowhere to go, so I enlisted. Yeah, I bet my dad was super excited about that. No. He didn't encourage it. He said he didn't want me in danger. -He did? -Yeah. I was afraid to go alone, so he drove me to the recruitment office, I wanted to tell you, but I didn't want you to get angry and we'd start fighting and ruin our last moments together. I just wanted to enjoy... Being us. Okay, um, so why haven't you told me about any of this? I did. I mean, I tried to. When I told you I was leaving, you-you were so angry, you didn't talk to me or your father. And I called you from the base, you didn't come to the phone. All the letters I wrote you, you never responded to any of them. Letters? I got one letter. I got one letter. And when I got it, I wasn't ready, I couldn't look at it. And-and then I never heard another word. For a year. I wrote to you every day. No, no, no, I got one letter, maybe two. But, but when I got the first letter, I completely freaked out, I-I threw it in the trash, my mom fished it out, she wanted me to read it, I couldn't open it. I told her she could Bury it for all I cared. My parents must have kept them all from me. Why would they do that? I don't know. I was hurt and I was, I was angry. I guess they were just trying to protect me. Yeah. They were protecting their soldier. Yeah, I want to be angry, but I guess it's coming from a good place. Yeah, I'm just relieved to finally know the truth. -Aren't you? -Uh, yes, yes, of course. Yeah. I mean, um, it's a lot. -Yeah. -You still lied to me. You led me to believe in something that was fiction. I never wanted to lie to you. Ever. I'm sorry. I, um... I need to sufficiently over-think this before I do or say anything else. I understand. Maybe I'll, uh, I'll leave. I want you to know I’m-I'm here for you. I promise. Um, maybe I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah, tomorrow, uh... [Instrumental music] [Music continues] [Cell phone ringing] Emmy! How are you? What's going on? Hi, dad. I'm well. I was wondering if... -Hey, you finished the tree! -Almost. -Everything except the angel. -Wow. That's really good, dad. Oh, and I never found your mom's special ornaments. You didn't? That's odd. I'm sure they're where they usually are. -Well, I couldn't find them. -Hm... So, dad, there is a chance I may be home for Christmas Eve. It'll be the middle of the night, but I wanted to see if your offer still stands. Breakfast Christmas morning? Of course it does, sweetie! All the more reason for me to finish my draft and get it to the publisher. Okay, good. Well, I should go. I still need to finish my wreath design. And you need to finish your draft. Sounds like a plan. I know you'll knock the socks off that wreath. -[Tom] I love you. -Thanks, dad. I love you, too. [Instrumental "jingle bells"] Okay, who wants hot chocolate? Ooh. Thanks. You're like the little Christmas elf. Yeah. Where's Emma? Uh, she's downstairs with Liz, grabbing supplies. Ooh. Okay. I just found the coolest spot with the best hot chocolate and her favorite little mini marshmallows. -She's gonna love it. -Hm. Oh. So I take it things are going well? You came home pretty late. Well, yeah, yeah, it was fun, it was amazing. I just have no idea how Emma feels right now. Hm. How do you feel? Uh, I feel great. I feel a little nervous, a little excited. I don't know, I mean, I-I just... i-I’m-I'm happy. You know, it's crazy, I didn't expect to be coming back here and falling in love again. I gotta tell her why I came. I mean, I thought I would just bring her home for Christmas and we would relive some of our memories from our childhood, but... this is something else. So would you say mission accomplished? Is she coming back home for Christmas or what? All right, listen, I know that was the plan all along, but... "The plan all along?" I don't understand. What was planned? Well, maybe we should talk about it. But you said you didn't even know I was in the city. Okay, right, I did say that, and I knew you were here, I knew about the shop. So why are you trying to get me home? Well, I just thought, you know, you and your father, you know... I don't know. I... He's lonely. It's the first Christmas since... Did he put you up to this? No, no, no, nothing like that. So, why, why are you so concerned with my relationship with my father? -I just... -You just... -I'm sorry, this was bef... -You just what, Aaron? I thought if I could convince you to come home for Christmas, we could all celebrate it together like we used to do. -That doesn't even... -Yeah. I mean, I tried to tell you... -I don't... -Emma... That's, that's why you came here? That's why you came to find me, to relive your Christmas memories? No, t-that's not the only reason. I mean, it's about family and the general and then, you know, Christmas, everything. You've been lying the whole time? Look, I didn't know that this... -I didn't think... -No. You didn't think. You didn't think about how complicated things are for me and my dad, you didn't think about how hard this year would be without my mom. You didn't think about how interrupting my life might affect me. Did you even for a second think about anyone other than yourself? No. But, hey, you wanted your Christmas, so, that's all that matters, right? I'm sorry. Are you about to lie to me again? -No, no. -That story about enlisting... Was that true? And the letters? Yes, i-it was true. It is true. Or did you orchestrate that, too? I care about you a lot, and last night I realized... It doesn't matter. I can't trust you. Aaron, how am I supposed to believe anything you say? Emma... [Mellow music] [Door opens] [Car engine starts] Emma! [Sarah] Aaron? Aaron... Crap. Did you know? -Well... -Why didn't you tell me? I'm sorry. Truly... I'm-I'm sorry. It was supposed to be this small thing, and then Aaron and Emma connected, and I, and I started falling for you... -I'm sorry. -You know... For a few days I thought you were perfect, too perfect, but... I'm glad that that's not true. [Liz chuckles] [Instrumental music] [Sighs] [Instrumental "silent night"] [Door opens] -Emma! Hi. I didn't expect you. -Hey. Dad. I know, I know. I'm not, um... I'm only here to get mom's ornaments. Oh, you found them. Where? They were in the hall closet, right where she left them. I thought I looked there. A-Are you gonna put them on your own tree? No. I have this idea about, um... Never mind. Did you send parks to come get me for Christmas? -I did not. -Well, he's in the city. It was all his idea. I never encouraged him. -Just like the last time. -The last time? -When he enlisted. -Emmy, I... And the letters? Parks said he wrote me for a year. -That's true. Your mother and... -And? Kept a huge secret from me for over a decade! Emmy, you are our daughter! Y-You were so upset! -Some things haven't changed. -I-I-I'm-I’m-I'm sorry. I can't do this. I can't do this right now. I have to go. If I don't go now, I'll never finish. -Ok-okay, so later? -Yeah. Always later.

And it doesn't matter if it's on Lakewood drive or in the city. And I'm here now to support you and everything you do. I'm sorry, too. I'm sorry for carrying grudges and holding on to past mistakes and cutting you out. I should have never stopped inviting you. Christmas will never be the same without your mom, so we shouldn't pretend that it is. So let's make new traditions, together. Like, Christmas Eve extravaganzas. [Laughs] Okay. Yeah. -Oh! -Wait for it. [Emma chuckles] You've completely captured your mother's essence. Well, dad, not just hers. [Both laughing] It's perfect. Ah, I'm so proud of you. And I know mom's watching and she's proud, too. Thanks, dad. And Aaron... He's really impressed with everything you've been doing. He said this was one of the best weeks of his life. He said that? What is this? Something I should have given you a long time ago. -[Upbeat music] -[Indistinct chatter] Hello! Hi! -Oh, hello! Hi! -[Camera clicking] So nice to see you! I can't wait to see your piece. Thank you. [Gasps] Hello! Hello! Oh, I can't wait to see your piece. Thank you. Hello! So where's Emma? [Instrumental music] Oh. -I can't do this right now. -Then I will. What? We tried not reading these, and you saw how that went. Just one. "Dear Emma, you're probably off at college, but I didn't have the address there. Bet you're creating masterpieces already. Even though our routine is the same every day here, it's all so different. Hopefully you'll get this when you're home for Christmas break." "I feel so far away from you. I'm not sure if you're getting my letters. I'll have them put an extra stamp on this one just to be safe. Please write back. Even with 20 roommates, it gets really lonely. I'm so, so sorry... For how we said goodbye. I miss you every day. Give my love to your mom. And in case you are seeing this in December, merry Christmas. I love you. Aaron." [Liz] Aww. -[Laughs] -Sorry. Oh, it's okay. You can "Aww." Kate's here, we have to get going. But speaking of awws, Aaron left this after your fight. Apparently, he's never taken it off. Never took it off? But I made this for him in high school. Is he, is he here? He dropped me off and went to park the truck. I-I'll bring the wreath out. You go find him. Okay. Emma, sweetheart, finally. I need to go over a couple of things. I'm so sorry. Can we talk later? -Oh. Yeah, sure. -Thank you. Liz, where do you want me to put this? -Right here. -Here's good? -This corner, yeah. -Sarah. Em, have you tried these cake bites? They're delicious. No, I haven't, but I'm so glad that they are. Um, have you seen Aaron anywhere? I'm not sure. I-I think he was outside. Merry Christmas, everyone! -[Indistinct chatter] -[Kate] Merry Christmas. [Applauding] [Kate] Thank you all for being here tonight. This is truly one of the most inspirational Kate margulies event to date. And none of this could be possible without the brilliant Emma king. Emma, come up and say a few words. -[All cheering] -[Kate] Come. -[Indistinct chatter] -[Man] Good job! -[Woman 1] Good job, Emma! -[Woman 2] Hey, Emma. -[Woman 3] Good job, Emma! -Hi. Thank you. Ah, thank you so much for that kind introduction, Kate. -Kate margulies, everyone! -Oh... [Applauding] Hey, there, am I too late? Oh, no, sir, you're not too late. Well, what are you doing out here in the snow? Eh, it's complicated. -Still? -Yeah. I'm sure it's nothin' a little holiday magic can't fix. Come on. Thank you all for being here on Christmas Eve. And, Kate, thank you. Thank you for asking me to take part in this challenge. Um, initially, I wasn't sure I was gonna be up for it. I lost someone very important to me not too long ago, and I was afraid that I'd lost my inspiration to create. But... over the last week, I've been reminded that those we love live on in our memories, and the greatest gift that we can give is to honor and Cherish their memories through our artwork. To my fellow designers who participated, thank you, thank you for sharing your gift with the world. Merry Christmas, everyone. -[Chuckles] -[Applause] [Kate] Oh, I say brilliant, right? Now, there's only a few minutes until the silent auction closes, so open up those wallets and let's make some bids! -[Cheering] -Go ahead. -[Woman] Thanks, ladies! -You were amazing, honey. -Thanks, dad. -Emma! Emma! Oh, that speech, and your wreath! You know what, I don't care who wins the bidding tonight, I need you on my show! Wait, really? Wow, Kate, I, uh... -I don't know what to say. -Say yes. Abigail, can you please get this all set up with her people, please? I'm sorry. Would you mind handling this with Liz? -Oh. Of course. -Thank you. [Indistinct chatter] Beautiful speech, my dear. Charlie! I'm so glad that you made it! Thank you. I wouldn't miss it! What an incredible showcase, huh, and a wonderful celebration of love and community. I told you not to let that man go. -Go on now. -Thank you, Charlie. -And merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. [Instrumental music] [Indistinct chatter] At ease, soldier. What's that? Oh, uh, well, seeing as you're not able to make it to Lakewood drive this Christmas, your father and I thought we'd bring a little Lakewood to you. Oh, that year... -Remember that? Hams-plosion! -Hams-plosion! Yeah. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -Aaron, I think... -Emma, hold on. Let me get this out. I... I need to tell you how sorry I am. I should have been upfront with you about that whole convoluted plan. Yes, I came here with the selfish intention of bringing you home. I thought I was thinking about you and about the general, but I didn't think about how hard it might be. I just wanted something so bad, I was willing to do just about anything to make it happen. It was selfish and inconsiderate. And I'm glad I did it. -What? -Well, now hear me out. If I hadn't set out on this mission, I'd have never been able to spend the last week with you. I never would've been able to see what an incredible life you've created for yourself. And I would have never known for certain what I've always suspected... I still love you, Emma. I don't think I ever stopped. And I know, I know me saying this right now is me being selfish, but if I don't get to see you for another 12 years, or worse, if I never see you again, I need you to hear this from me. I love you, Emma king. You are my Christmas. You are my every day. I never thought I could forgive you for how you left. It completely shook me. I lost my best friend and I didn't know if I was ever gonna have that again. But now I know that my best friend didn't go anywhere, and the only reason I lost him is because I shut him out of my life. But now that he's back, I am never, ever letting him go. I love you, Aaron Parker. E plus a, now and always. You make my Christmas very, very merry. [Instrumental music] [Liz] Em! Em! Sorry to interrupt. Uh, but the totals are in, and your wreath had the highest bid. -What? -[Liz] Congratulations! That's amazing! Ah! Congratulations! Okay, uh, we have to take a picture to commemorate. All right. I knew you were gonna win. -Oh, the wreath! -I already thought of that! Okay. Say, "merry Christmas Eve extravaganza!" [All] Merry Christmas Eve extravaganza! [Camera clicks] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music]
