ADAM MICKIEWICZ Thank you. Ticket control, please. Thank you. Your ticket, please. Thank you. Thank you. - At university, aren't you? - Not yet. A beautiful cap. Lovely embroidery, so I've thought you study. It's our custom, we do it before the final exams. Something is written here. Per aspera ad astra. It's our school motto. You know, in the next compartment there is a real archbishop travelling. Have you seen? Don't waste your time! Look, young man. Beautiful. Yes. He cannot see us. This is how it will all begin. What will happen? I come back here more and more often, I come at night, from far away, sometimes even in the daylight. I will go away too. I know everything. And what awaits me in my life? I might know, but I am not allowed to tell, sometimes it's better not to know. I've lost my cap in the compartment, I must go back. With embroideries? You won't lose it. But you will never wear any other. Wicio? Come to me. What is it again, mum? Come here, child. - Handsome, you are. - Mum, it's a shame. The loveliest. There is no other like you. - I swear, I will run away. - It's your present, son. What if I don't pass the finals? So who will, if you don't? Many things might happen. You must be the best, you have always been. How can you say such silly things? You will be a great doctor. A professor. You will help everybody, the rich and the poor, the kings and the beggars. Mum, you will jinx it. Only weak people can be jinxed. You are strong. Come here. For God's sake, come. I'm back from my aunt's, grandpa. How was your holiday? Very good, if it wasn't for the flood. Jadzia, my child, will it be long till I die? I hope not, daddy. God has mercy. So help me, God. And what's that on your head? A university cap. Is Wiciu at university already? I know nothing, nobody informs me. Not yet, daddy. In a month he will pass his finals. He will start medicine this autumn. Autumn, you say? I won't live till the autumn. Thank God, I won't. Good day! I have a request, lad. Take this telegram to colonel Nałęcz, my children are a handful, I can't get out. You know, the new family, they live in the military estate. He's tired, Mr Kiežun, straight from the train. Tired? With these rosy cheeks? Everybody envies you such a son. Take my bike, and tell them to mark the exact delivery hour. Damn it. I forgot to switch off my iron. Thank you! Take it, Wicio. Maybe you will bring them luck. It might be good news. - What is it, sir? - A telegram, from the post office. Don't worry, the dog won't bite you. - What's happened, Zosia? - It's the post. The man has brought a telegram. Where is it? Mom, Dad is coming! Mum, dad is coming tomorrow. See, I've had a premonition. I dreamt of a train. Running on the ground, not on the rails. Sign the receipt. Please, write the exact time. We have to give him a tip for his effort. Yes, give him 50 grosz coin. You haven't told me father writes: 'We are coming' and not 'I am coming'. I haven't noticed. I am so happy. We could give him 1 zloty. You love pampering people. 50 is enough. Enough. Yes that's all. Thank you, my ladies. I wish you a good night. Thank you for the tip. I will try to make a big fortune. I apologize. You see, what's happened? Maybe I will fall in love with her? What do you think? Maybe I will be broken hearted and die? Witka, come, I will tell you something. Hi, Lovka. What are you doing here? - Nothing, just a pee. - But besides that? We are playing jackstraws. Come and see. Come on, I am going home. Stop it, they have asked me to bring you. Oh, Wicio, haven't seen you for long. Your mum sent you to the countryside, she is scared of local girls doing you some harm. We also would keep such a lad to ourselves. I remind you, I am your fiancé. Lova, empty words. What do I have from this engagement? What? Delight. Physical satisfaction. Go away, you lecher. Are we playing or not? For God's sake! Look, he's jealous. Wicio...? Would you be so kind as to play the record again? The autumn roses, Roses yellow, red and sweet. The autumn roses like your lovely rosy lips. Brazen hussies... To lead students on. Mum would better go to bed, there is nothing for you here. What a fate. What a disaster. Lord, what a ghastly year. They say there will be a war again. They say it every year. Don't you fancy fucking one of them? Why me, not you? You are the brave one. I have a girlfriend in town. Do you? Who do you want to fool? I swear to God. Show me a picture? Now, at night? But you could get one of them or even both. They are old. Might be thirty. That's true. But don't you feel anything? I do, everybody would. I have such an urge, my hard-on would break a board. Everybody has. - Give the bicycle to Mr Kiežun. - Go away! Is that you? You brought us the telegram yesterday? You gave me a 50 grosz coin. I didn't want to offend you, I did it out of habit. I am not offended. I will keep the coin as a keepsake. Can I? I don't know. Is it appropriate? What do you think, Zuza? Let's go. I am sorry I have stood like that. I didn't know you were sitting there. Welcome. You can sit on the free bench. Thank you, but there is our stop soon. You will catch a chill. Why haven't I seen you before? Haven't you travelled to school by train before Easter? I have, for a year and a half. That's impossible. I see you on the train for the first time. And yesterday I saw you first time in my life. This cannot be. You have pushed me over a few times. And in winter you, lads, hit us with snowballs. I can't believe it. I would have remembered you. But you didn't. I will have to live with it. Why did you say so? It isn't true. - That I will live? - No, that I haven't noticed you. Oh, it's our stop. Kolonia station! See you around! You had been waiting for them, you fool. I was watching. Which one do you like? Alina? I don't know if I like anybody. Maybe I only like medicine. - Shall we bet? - About what? That she has wrapped you around her finger. - Who? - Alina! - It's an ugly name. - You will find it beautiful later. Why can't you leave me alone. Are you jealous? - Maybe. Shall we bet? - What about? An imponderable. If I win, I can give you a task. Lovka! You fancy her, Lev Tygrysovich, don't you? You've said you first met her a few days ago. Has she really lived here for a year and a half? Perhaps. So, a bet? What can I win? The same as me. Give me your hand. Let it be. A bet. So, little bunny? Remember me? Give me your fur, so I can go to your lady and be with her till late. Or, at least let me in. Come, dear, it's late, it's getting really cold. You're right, we must get up early tomorrow. But let's drink some tea first. I will make. Let me in, don't hinder. Let it be, you will eat me or I will live long and happily ever after. I know it's disgusting, bunny, but it's just the once. Once in a lifetime. That's it, what is she doing? All that for nothing. In vain. Turn the light on. You have nothing to lose. Can you hear me? Turn it on, I order you with all my strength. That was my first and last time. Goodbye, my friend. Rex! Here! What's going on? Who's in the garden? You see, rotter, I will give you to the dogcatchers. - Who's here? - I'm sorry, I've lost my way. Who are you looking for, sir? I wanted to find the street that leads to the cemetery. It's not the road to the cemetery, it leads to the military estate. My mother died in a foreign land, she wanted to die here, to rest in this cemetery at the church, on the forest hill. There is no cemetery there. Just a forest clearing. That's right, no cemetery yet. It will appear at the end of war. Wouldn't you guide me a bit, Wicio? I can hear a radio, and you? How do you know me? I have known you before, I do not remember much. Guide me, if you can. I fell in love today and then I fell out. I remember, you will love each other terribly until... Until what? You will see, it will be soon. How do you remember? It's in my memory. So many woodland strawberries, they will ripe soon. Who are you? Witek, I've been looking for you all evening. - What do you want? - Greta is ill. Get a doctor. Where will I find him? She has high fever. I can't do anything. How come? You keep your head in medical books all days. I swear to God, I can't help. Are you crazy? - And who cured Lovka? - Lovka just had constipation. - You don't want to help? - I do, but I can't. - Are you too lazy to come and see? - I can see but it won't help much. You asleep? Wicio has come to check on you. I am fine. Really, I have drunk some herbs. I will be better by tomorrow. Come on, sit on the bed. - What do you think? - Bring a watch with a sweep hand. You don't want to go to school? Give me your hand. There is no fever. It cannot be, she was burning in the evening. She asked me to bring you. I didn't. See, she's lying. Get your shirt up, you German cow. I won't. A Berlin performance. I don't want to! Are you ashamed of your back? Go on, examine her. I can't hear anything. And what? Nothing. This is all strange to me. What is it? Nothing. Everything is all right. All right? - So she is healthy? - So it seems. - You've known that! - So why did you want a doctor? You are an idiot, a fool, a churl. - How dare you? - You German stinker! What an insolence! She dares to say I am German! Look under my eyes. I am a real Mongol, aren't I? I must change this silly name. What is the matter, my son? - Gówno - shit. - Was? - Gówno. - What is KUVNO? Close your gob, you Meclenburg Prussian! So many years and you haven't learnt the human language? Whose bread do you eat, you old xenophobe? I will ask you just one thing: call me Władek. And the surname is Drewnowski. Władysław Drewnowski, understand? - Wićka, you know? - I don't. - Lucky you. - Me, lucky? - Yes, you. - Are you crazy, Engel? Not Engel, Władek. Władek, what did you want to say? What does it mean? Go to hell! Zum teufel. Wait, what is it? Listen to me, obey my orders. I am a wicked, selfish, cold individual. If I have done something like this, you must obey me. Listen, you have to get up now and come to me. I have played truant from school for you. I count to ten: one, two... three... four... five... six... seven... seven and a half... eight... eight and one fourth... For the last time I order you to come. If you don't, you will regret it till the end of your life. All right. I won't order. I beg you with all my strength, I pray that you listen to me and come. If not, I will curse you. Good morning. Good morning. You've called me, so here I am. But I didn't want to... How come? I felt some fluids, so I had to skip school. It must be a mistake. I know you didn't want to. I brought you the book back. What book? Chemistry. Do you recognize? No. Not really. I don't know. There is your signature on the front page. It might be, I don't remember. Thank you for your trouble. You know, I've had a feeling you had been waiting for me. I swear. I dreamt about you last night, I don't remember much, but it was you, I am sure... it must be a mistake. You have said that. But I am a very good medium. There must have been something. Don't you think so? I felt bad, I left before the last two lessons. So why have I come to The Castle Hill? I never come here. - Me neither. - You see, it's strange. Yes, it is. Can I sit here for a while? I am out of breath. Of course. Haven't you really noticed me for a year and a half? I am really busy. I work a lot, I would like to study medicine. - My father is a doctor, too. - And what does your cousin study? Law. He was doing law, but he quit. Quit studies? A romantic tragedy. Love affair. - But I am an egocentric. - Sorry? No, it's nothing. Don't believe me. I didn't feel any fluids. I've just escaped from school. I often do it. What a pity. Yes, it's a pity. Because I used to fancy you. You used to fancy me? Yes, but it was at the beginning, over a year ago. What a pity! It's nothing to regret. I am a monster. Selfish, narcistic. - Just like me. - Impossible! - Really! - Interesting. We would torment each other. - Fortunately it's all out-of-date. - Why? - You have just said so. - Only to make you upset. - Really? - Of course. Upsetting others is my specialty. - Where did you lose your book? - Where have you found it? I haven't. A dog brought it when I was leaving for the train. It's so windy, shall we go down? Yes, let's go, I hope no one from the school sees us. - They won't. I am lucky. - It's good to be lucky. - Good and bad. - Why bad? - Because luck must be paid for. - And how are you going to pay? Just once, but the price will be high. I will die young. Everybody wants to die young. It's in fashion now. You as well? Actually, yes, but I can't, I have some things to do. I will show you a beautiful place. It's really lovely. I've gone out of breath. Oh, Lord, how pretty she is. Fortunately I am cold, calculated, not sentimental. You have said it again: I am cold, calculated... No, I haven't said anything. I lip read. You must be careful with me. I will. Do you know I really like ice cream? I am sorry, I don't eat ice cream. Don't be silly, they drip onto my hands. Not for the world. I will throw them onto you. You see, life is not the worst thing. Perhaps. I change my mind easily, you must remember. I will. What are you thinking now? - About you, of course. - I am not worth it. I am sorry. That's nothing. It's really late, I must go back, and you? I should stay but I will walk you a bit. I have made a fool of myself. It happens, even to cold hearted people. - Do you want to go back? - I don't, but I have to. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. She must turn back, for good luck. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee' blessed art thou amongst women... Caution! Pray, you meadows adorned with May Pray the groves that give us shade Pray high mountains, valleys green River springs, meandering streams. Witek! - Where are you going? - I will see, who is calling. Don't. We both know, who it is. It's not appropriate, I must go. I will go and say you are not home. I am not a child. You are, but you don't know it. Wicio, I have a bad feeling. I know what I am doing. They aren't a company for you. Are we disturbing? No, I have just finished my homework. This is my cousin Sylvek, this is Wicio. Nice to meet you. We will see. Don't mind him, he is always like that. Will we hang on the fence for long? Will you have a ride by the river with us? I'd like to, but I don't have a bike. I will sit on the frame and you on the saddle. Will you manage? I will try. Rex! At my leg. I would prefer not at the legs. Don't rush like that, I am out of breath. All right, I will slow down. Are you angry with me? Absolutely not, how could you think so? Let's put the bikes here, we can sit. I've wanted you two to meet. - Are you going to study medicine? - Yes, I am planning to. Will you treat the plutocrats? Yes, if they come, but first of all the poor ones. You will start with the poor and end up with the rich. Let's warm up. Do you want to arm wrestle? If you want. I want, but will you dare? But for what? I like gambling. I respect gamblers, young man. - For Alina? - I don't allow you! Go away, baby, this is for men. On this stone? - Yes, it will be fine. - I don't want to. I don't like silly bits. Witek, please, be sensible. Witek, come back to me, you will regret. Let's be on first name terms. Are you ready, lad? I am. Damn it, what a paw he has! - Almost broke my bones. - I am sorry, master. You've won, she is yours. Have you asked if I want it? Don't worry, I didn't fight for you. So for whom? Nobody, it's nothing. I would fall asleep and wouldn't wake up. And waste such a lovely day? But I won't sleep. I will suffer till the morning. Tossing and turning, stuffy, hot, more and more thoughts about this and that. Nonsense thoughts, nonsense dreams and hopes, my heart thuds, and then comes fear. You have sleep medicine. I've bought the whole jar today. I want to explain, so you do not think... I'm not thinking anything. Really. But you are so weird with me. What if I swallowed all these pills and sleep until the judgement day? Suicide is a horrible sin. What a sin? And if you don't want to live? Why suffer? Isn't it a bigger sin? We don't know. And if we don't know, we should listen to nature. It's fear. Scared to live, scared to take your own life. Maybe one day we will be allowed to write a formal request and get a death voucher in a municipal hospital? - Do you suffer? - I haven't said that. Stop groping, you snotty brat! I just like you, dumpling. Go away, or I will hit you. The same, all the time. Have you ever told a woman kind words? Have you ever told a woman you love her, you are mad about her? I can say that. So do it. Shall I say it to you? It might be me. But they are listening. Let them listen. I love you. He experimented. Shameless! I should get offended. Don't be impudent. You've learnt a lesson. Remember, what honour is. Get a grip on yourself, drink some cabbage juice. I am bursting, I will explode one day. I have to stick it somewhere or I will get crazy. It torments me. I see a skirt and I am out of breath. I see hair in the wind or bare legs and I am choking. Even a knothole gets to me. When I catch myself at night, oh Lord, it goes up to the ceiling. - It makes me crazy. - It will pass. Not for me. Even after I die, I will chase angels. Calamity. - We all suffer with it. - You too? Me too. But I won't break and surrender. I must do something with him, or he will break free and kill me. - Witold? - Yes? - Has Engel told you? - No, he hasn't. I must go away. After the school breaks, father sends me to Germany. What's happened? Nothing has happened yet. - He is scared of the war. - There won't be a war. This has been always said. Who will fight whom? Me and Engel? Or Engel and Lovka? Engel, shall we fight? We will live long and happily until we die. Do you think we will live till the 2000? There won't be any war. What a beautiful, strange evening. An enormous herd of birds is hanging over the town. Are you still here? Nothing to be done, we must go to sleep. Lucky you. Where are my medicines? I've just seen them. How will I sleep without my ambrosia? They were on the table. Haven't you taken my medicine? What for? We sleep like in lethargy until the dawn. We will buy new supplies tomorrow. We must only make it through the night. I will sleep or I won't, it doesn't matter. So why are you crying? I don't know. I am, that's it. Spring again. Dull and lacklustre. Such an ordinary year. 1939. Nothing to remember. Good night, dears. Good night. Leave her alone. You pushy bastard! Witka, do you sleep without medicines? I do. I can't sleep without my ambrosia. Good night. Greta! I love you!!! Is that you, Rex? Why are you spying on me? And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of death. Amen Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee' blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. I have fallen in love, grandpa. Can you hear me? There was something like that. I won't deny it. But I don't remember... I have fallen in love. There, there. Nobody has died of it. Maybe I will be the first? Why are you tormenting me? Am I? You are tormenting yourself. Can I walk you to the train? If you want. - I can explain it. - What? It's an illusion of your own ambitions. Progressing auto-suggestion. Subconscious imitation of events you've read about, you've seen in the cinema. - And you take it all for... - For what? - You know, what it is. - You are scared to say: love. It's a big word, I will never say it. Can't you see my cut head? I have hurt my head for you, because of you. Don't tell rubbish. You lose your sense of humour. I can do it, there are no witnesses. You are scared of being ridiculed. You will be scared till the end of your life. - What are you really like? - You know. How am I to know? You were peeping. Walk me to Dworcowa corner. But only there, I don't want any further. You know a war is coming? Why don't you say anything? So, thank you, see you. Can I... Can I walk you to the station? Unless you don't want to. I don't. See you. You must meet me. The last time. It's very important. We have just said goodbye. Yes, but I need to talk to you. Please, I will be waiting at your home at six. At my home? Yes. I beg you. I will never ask you anything again. - As you wish. - So, will you come? Yes. But do not follow me now. Swear you won't go any further. All right, I swear. Lord, what's happened? I will get mad. Here he is! We've got him! The world is coming to an end, you have played truant. Haven't you? I have, but it's not your business. It is. Do you remember our bet? - What bet? - Don't play a fool! About love. Am I an idiot? Where have you been all day? Somewhere - but I won't be there any more. We've got him! Witek, she is ill! We went for an X-ray, her heart is swollen. Many people live with swollen hearts. Why are you so unkind for her? What are you talking about, I really like her. That's good, she mustn't get upset. And who wants to upset her? Witek, can you hear me? I can. - I'd like to apologise. - For what? For everything. There is nothing to apologise. You treat me like a child. Engel always has fun at my expense. Greta, it's not a high expense. It's high for me. Why have you brought me here? I don't know. Accidentally. So, what would you like to tell me? I can't wait. I can't say it right now. So let's wait. For whom have you used the lipstick? Have I, really? For me or for your cousin? Just for myself. Look at your hands. You have a long way to go. No, my way ends here, you see. At this buckthorn bush. Alina! What's happened? Alina, wait! Wait! I must have lost this coin here. If I find it, everything will be fine. It must have been here. I will be searching till the morning, until I find. And if you don't? Are you spying on me? Perhaps I am. You have lost the bet. Such things aren't for bets. What's happened? Why are you so serious? You've lost, you have to pay. How do you know I have lost? The whole town talks about you and Alina. How do you want me to pay? I will kick your ass three times. Lovka, are you crazy? We've had a bet, remember? Won't you tell anybody about the bet? I have my honour too. So go on. Lovka, don't pretend. Lev Tygrysovich, get up, do you want to scare me? What? Time to get up? Damn it, my teeth is loose. Who's that? That's me, Lovka. Just a second. - O, Christ the Saviour. - Will you come with me? To whom? To the Baums, don't you remember? They are waiting for you. Come, I won't manage alone. Come, I've got something. What have you got, Lovka? The lovage herb. Today I will get one of them, but I don't know which one. I kept looking for him and I found. Here you have your lad. So, does he have to be dragged by force? - You'd better not ask. - Was he there? He knelt under the tree, praying to the skies. Come, you little one? You will drink the oblivion elixir. Come, don't protest, it's not nice to dawdle when older ladies ask you. Drink in one draught, then the eyelid of your third eye will open, you will see the same but more beautiful. I don't want it more beautiful. It's good enough as it is. Drink, Wicio. Perhaps we won't meet any more. Why wouldn't we meet? You know. I will drink too. First time in my life. So, to the beautiful ladies. Which beautiful ladies? All of them. And the one of mine. I can see with my third eye. And something is humming inside me, ...but in a nice way. Let it be. Will you dance with me? It's our last Sunday Today we will say good bye We will go our separate ways Forevermore It's our last Sunday So give it all to me Look at me tenderly For the last time. So many Sundays lie ahead of you. And to me, what happens? Who would guess? I wanted to break it for good luck. You have to hit with all your strength to break. I didn't know that. What will happen now? I am sure you will be happy. How can you know? I have a feeling we will all be happy. I am leaving next month. What for? My father is scared of the war. Engelbert, my beloved! It is much too late. Father, please, just one hour! You know..., I am... a horrible German girl, but... the same time I am not German any more and I will never be. It's too difficult for me. Sensible German girls do not drink so much strong wine and so on. What does it mean: and so on? Many things have happened. Look at Engel, does he look like a... solid German lad? He's not German any more, but he will never be Polish. You know, Greta, I feel sick, I see everything in pieces. I feel dizzy too. Let's go outside. I can't stand it. It was my first time with alcohol. Why is it spinning? I imagined it would be better. Why don't you say anything? I am re-examining my life. Do you have to? Just now? Perhaps we will die after your wine? - Maybe someone has poisoned it? - I would never allow it. I would die first. Kiss me. Not like that! I am sorry. She is very pretty. Not worse than the other one. She has almost the same breast, almost the same belly, almost the same thighs. Almost... What's happened with me? Lovka? What's happened? It's the last Sunday My dreams so long dreamt My longed for happiness Come to an end. The moon is frightening today. What's happened? Can you hear my heart thumbing? What are you looking for? I feel really bad. Something hurts me, but I don't know what. What are you rooting for in our drawer? For the father's card. Whose father? Yours. There was a distinction card. You might remember, for his courage in Lithuanian-Belorussian front. A white card with black print from a war printing house, with general Szeptycki's signature. There was something like that. But there are lots of rubbish and old pictures. Yes, I cannot find the documents from German times. Arbeitsammt book, kennkarta, a partisan card. I have never seen these papers. You are right. They are not here yet. Something keeps dragging me towards these scraps. Why can't I see your father's pictures? I don't know. There was one, a passport photo. What's happened with the others? Maybe your mother has destroyed them. - Perhaps she was scared. - Here is my father's picture. You see, an ordinary face, there are many of this sort in the streets. I don't remember him any more. Was he good, noble, kind? What did he think? What did he miss? Who did he really love? - Perhaps you remember? - I have never thought of it. You will miss you father one day. - Why do you come to us? - I do not frighten you, do I? Perhaps I am a ghost who does not scare anybody? Who torments himself, looking for meaning where it doesn't exist? Whatever I tell you now, I won't stop you, I won't change your fate. I don't care about my future. Is it the one with long black plait, Renia or Lusia? A bomb killed her. No, she went to Stockholm via Lithuania and disappeared. Her name is Alina. - Have you got so ill? - Mortally. First time in my life. I will take your father's picture. Take it. It's for luck. But I don't need luck any more. Is that you? Coming home so late? No, I've been sleeping. A ghost has woken me up. What are you blathering about? What ghost? He's walking there, in the trees at Lovka's house. Look, mum. There is nobody there. The dawn will break soon. You galavant all days and then you cannot sleep. - I have seen a real ghost twice. - And you are so calm? - He haunts but doesn't scare me. - There were real ghosts in my times. This one is real, but he doesn't want anything from the living souls. Have you been drinking? Jesus, so it has started. Have you taken my 50 grosz coin, mum? Why did you keep it, where I've put a crumb of holy bread for you? I keep it for luck. - I know your sort of luck! - Give it back. No! I haven't got it. I threw it to the river. It's a shame to believe in superstitions. It's for your own good, you must be strong. If you fall once, you won't get up. Mum, I will deal with my life myself. They walk all night, talk business and I don't know anything, nobody informs me. Is that you, Wicio? Yes. I cannot sleep. Have you opened the window? Mother has put a snake skin under my bedclothes. She is getting mad. She prays all days, brews herbs, tries everything. Can you hear the nightingale? I can hear everything. I am all like one, big dying ear. - Have you slept this night? - I am awaken. All the time. And if I die before you? What are you talking about, child? Excuse me. Good morning, Zuza. Here is the seat, please. No, thank you. I just want to have a word in private. Go on. I'd like to know what's happened to Alina. - Alina? - It's important. I have lent her a book, I need it now. So visit her. I think she has a cold. Yes. I didn't know. I will visit her, of course. You see, it's simple. I rarely find simple solutions. But I think her parents might not be glad. - What about her? - You should know yourself. - Now it's too late. - For what? Now I do not care. - What's happened? - A telegram for the young miss. I will sign it. - I must give it to her, personally. - I said I will sign. - The lady should do it. - Stay in your room, understood?! - I will sign, it must be enough. - I am not allowed. - Please, give it to me. - I really can't. Let go! - Give me the telegram back. - You've brought it to our home. Give it back, I will bring it some other time. - Don't you need the signature? - I don't. This is for Alina. You bastard! Don't roam around here or I shoot salt into your ass! - Mind your words. - What! You rotter! You are out of your mind! You're exaggerating! No, you've got mad. It's too much. I see him for the fifth time, he brings faked telegrams, I will pickle him with salt. It's not worth coming here. Has she told you to talk to me? She doesn't say anything, but I know. Why doesn't she want to meet me? She can't. They will take her abroad after the exams. - It's in a few days. - Yes, that's true. What should I do? There will be a war. I don't care for war or peace, I must see her or I will get mad. She says you just imagine things. What's the difference between what I feel and what I imagine? Maybe you can tell me, because she couldn't! Witold?! Witold! I think she suffers a lot. Alina! Alina! In the name of father and son and the holy ghost. So, you pickled cock, you still alive? Why does it bother you? You've got salt in your ass? Listen, you amorous bird, to hell with her, go home. Your mother must have cooked something nice. They are silly capitalists. Waste of time. Don't you know any normal girls? I don't. You have no shame, you fool. To beg these dumb philistines? Take a bottle of oil, burn the colonel's pretentious shed. What's so impressive about them? The end of them will come soon. So why do you stay with them? What are you waiting for? Jealous, aren't you? All right, you wimp, I have some news. Alina will come to meet you at noon, in the spot we sat by the river together. Are you happy? Maybe you want to get rid of me? Look, can you see her at the window? What are you doing, child? Why do you loiter around this house? I know what I am doing. Everything will be fine. We will go back together, son. I dreamt of a big fire. Everything was burning, the house, the whole town, the whole world. I will stay, everything will be all right. I will scream. So loudly I will wake up everybody. I know, mum. I know everything but I will stay and don't force me, because something horrible might happen. Promise me, you will be back. I promise. I have brought you the coat. All right, I will take it, but please, go and leave me. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee' blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. What are you doing? See, what trouble you've caused? You shouldn't have taken up with me. Have I? You have imagined it. - It's too late. - For what? You know it very well. We will get married just after the exams. I see you've gone crazy. My parents will never agree. Now it's too late. - What is he doing at your place? - Who? Your so-called cousin. Don't lie or I will strangle you. What is he doing? Rex? Where have you come from, doggie? Maybe he's in love with me? Don't look at me like that. I am ashamed. It's too late now. Cuckoo, how many years will I live? How long will we both live? You see? We won't live any more. She gives us one year. Five... six, seven. Forty two, forty three, forty four. That's enough, I don't want more. We don't need fortune telling. I have wanted you, I have fought for you. Now it's too late. The cuckoo says we have many years lying ahead. Where have you been when I didn't know you? And where have you been? I feel dizzy with it. Wait, I will give you some shade. I am dying. No, it's the adulthood waking up. Where have we been for so long? How come that I remember it? Did it happen to me before? Wait, not yet. My heart will break. Where have we been for so long? Shall we escape after the exams? To one of the university towns. - Will you be the greatest doctor? - Will you be a professor's wife? Maybe I love you already? Of course you do. Is it possible not to love me? Two most wicked people in the neighbourhood. And Sylvek? Sylvek? It's his forced migration. Why? He has got into trouble. He gave private lessons to a high school girl and fell in love with her. And she was Jewish. When will such things cease to divide people? There will be always something to divide. What are you orders now? We must go, my father would kill me. We will meet on the day of exam results. - Goodbye, my husband. - Goodbye, my wife. Don't chase me. I must go alone. She must turn. For good luck. Are you back, son? That's good. I know everything will be fine. I have prayed all day. Here you have some herbs. Drink before the night. Do you think it will help? Yes. You must be strong before the exams. Grandpa feels better. He's eaten the whole bowl of broth. Then he asked me to open the window so he could listen to the nightingale in the elder bush. Mum, life has some meaning, doesn't it? Thanks God you are saying so. - You will get better. - I'd like to wake up in a week time. Go to sleep. In a week you will be after the exams. But where will I be then? Witek, what's happened? Why are you so silent? No, it cannot be. You've failed? Say something! Have you failed your finals? Look, father has brought me this mask. It's real, combat. What will happen now? I don't know. You were born with silver spoon in your mouth. I can't believe it now. Could retake it next year, as an extramural. I won't live till next year. Is it my fault? Neither yours, not mine. Do you love me? Why did you accost me then? - Do you regret? - I don't. I am ready for anything. - What does it mean? - It means everything possible. - Someone is peeping. - Where? There, in the alder bush. It's Rex. Come, ninny, console us. Let's take poison. We will kill each other. You will kill me, and I will kill you. Aren't you scared... of eternity? With you, I am not. It's better to die for love. Yes, it's better to perish loving. I will come tomorrow, the same hour, in a white dress. Why white? We will get married. Just how I dreamt. I will see you tomorrow, darling. In our last afternoon, my beloved. - At our last moments. - At the beginning of eternity. Witek! Witold? Won't you say good bye? We've been looking for you for an hour. Leave him alone. He is a grown up man, he has his own affairs. Witold... What are you doing!? She is leaving. We don't know when she will be back. Greta is leaving? You've forgotten? What's wrong with you? Listen to our skylark. I won't say a word. You will see, I will intoxicate with Korn and Munich beers, become a scandalist and land in a solid, German madhouse. What are you saying, my little Piggy? It's our last Sunday, Today we will say goodbye... She is also packed to go. - Who? - Alina. The butler has been carrying suitcases to the car. - When is she leaving? - This night. To Krakov or maybe to Lvov. My God! You are crazy, my Piggy! Come! Come, quickly! My God, it's so heavy. What are they taking? Bad feelings and five stones of fear. I don't care. Damn it, I have strained my back with those bloody suitcases. Goodbye, do svidanya! Be back soon, child. We will be waiting for you. We will find you a real suitor after the war. Come on, there won't be a war. They will make threats and then it will get solved. Come back, white chicken. So many Sundays lie ahead of you... Hold him! Has he gone mad? There! For good luck! I don't need luck, do I? But they need it. Those who are staying. Was I seeing things? I might have seen the archbishop, but I don't know what for. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, my love. Don't you congratulate me? It's my birthday. - What can I wish you? - Sit here with me. Your dress will get dirty. I won't need it again. Hold me. Kiss me. Love me. - Are you ready? - Yes, I am. We can change our minds. Let's be gone now. A long dying would start soon, anyway. Let's go to the river. We will need water. I've put it in the wafer. I've brought it in woodland strawberries. Let's say good bye first. We will have a lot of time for farewells. Who will go first? I can do it. No, me. Please. I am a man. I am still a man. All right. But I want to feed you. I'd better do it myself. If it's a sin, let it burden my soul. Take it from my hands, my husband. First woodland strawberries. How did you know I love them? I thought it would be better, if I pick them myself. Let's go to the bank. May the river stay sinless. Goodbye. I think I am going... Goodbye, my beloved. Thank you for everything. Thank you for death. Thank you, too. If only you could know how much I love you. How much I loved you. Despite everything. For everything. Can you still hear me? Like from afar. In a moment we will know everything. If there is anything to know. Now it is all the same. Sleep, my darling. And you sleep sweetly, my lover. Strong air force is strong Poland. The land of my childhood is gone. It only lives within me, and with me it will turn to dust, in one of these hours, that approach me from oblivion.
