ANSGAR CHURCH HEDEHUSENE We know who they are... The beautiful young people They have run away... ...like playflies... Sorry, like playful butterflies. The very first summer day "He'd seen in 'Breaking Bad' how to dispose of a body using acid." THOMAS GOTTHARD'S CONFESSION "He'd need more acid than you could buy at the supermarket. He searched the Internet for plastic that will withstand acid." One of your first questions were why I decided to participate in this documentary. -Yes. -And... I decided to participate because Thomas has been so manipulative throughout this. He's had a lot of practice. He can convince anyone of anything. My worry is that Thomas, when he's released from prison will convince others that it was Maria's own fault that she got killed. THE PRIEST FROM HELL COPENHAGEN The police have issued the following description of Maria From Jakobsen. She's 177 cm tall, of average build and has shoulder-length light hair. THREE CRIME REPORTERS FROM EKSTRABLADET HAVE COVERED THE MURDER OF MARIA JAKOBSEN FOR TWO YEARS THEY HAVE WRITTEN MANY ARTICLES AND PRODUCED A PODCAST BUT THE CASE CONTINUES TO CONSUME THEM THE MARIA MYSTERY Why do we want to revisit this case? It has to make sense for us as well as the family. We're asking a lot of them. They have to relive this again. There are a number of important, unanswered questions. What are Thomas Gotthard's characteristics? What does it tell us about someone when they're able to do what he did when he killed her? What do we know about his movements? We have to solve the puzzle. How extensive was his deception? What did he tell people? How many feel misled by him? I like being a crime reporter because I get to move in some social circles that I wouldn't otherwise move in. You get to meet people that you wouldn't otherwise meet. That is one aspect we can look at. He was a pastor and enjoyed people's confidence for a long time. As a crime reporter you get close to people during the worst time of their life. When it comes to murder there's often a ripple effect. There are a lot of victims. Next of kin, family and friends. On both sides. There are many victims in these cases. The Maria From Jakobsen is another example of that. The web of lies and manipulation, the many victims he's left behind. He leaves a trail of atrocities behind. The very first summer day What they want out of life Only they know The beautiful young people May they live long INTERVIEW WITH MARIA'S PARENTS: EVIL, LIES AND DECEPTION I became involved in the case against Thomas Gotthard for the murder of Maria From Jakobsen when it came before the court. HILLERØD COURT I was there when he confessed to the murder and explained how he'd soaked Maria From Jakobsen's body in acid. WE BECAME NAUSEOUS. HE HAS NO REGRETS. He buried the body, dug it up, dismembered the body and burned it. It's incomprehensible that someone would go that far to get rid of a partner. It's my work so obviously something I have to be able to cope with. And I can but I have of course thought about the victims, especially Maria's children, her parents and siblings. It's a case that affects you. You learn to cope with that. It's not our story. We just tell it. We have no right to tell the story. Only the family does. It's our task to convey it. We're talking about a priest, a psychologist and a very functional family on the outside. Common setup, dad, mum, they had two children together and a couple of children from a previous marriage. Normal people you'd expect to save up to go on holiday every year. MARIA'S MUM INGER MARIA'S DAD SØREN Let's talk about the reason we can't see your face. The reason we want to be as anonymous as possible is that we're trying to get our daily lives to work for the kids. MARIA AND THOMAS FALL IN LOVE In the beginning I thought they were a harmonious couple. They looked good together. They fell head over heels for each other. Thomas and Maria met each other when Marianne's son was baptised. He was assistant priest at the church. They had met each other before, but not been involved, while they were still at high school. But they were both in relationships. Now neither had a partner and they fell in love. There was a spark like in a Disney film. Even I could see it. There was something there. He's a well-educated and intelligent person that would counter-balance her. Maria was a well-educated and intelligent person herself. She needed that counter-balance. You two are the most important people here. Now, for two seconds, this is all about you. Yes. As you have told me you'd like to marry each other I ask you, Thomas Gotthard, if you want to marry Maria From Jakobsen? I do. Likewise, I ask you, Maria From Jakobsen if you want to marry Thomas Gotthard. I do. As you have now confirmed you want to marry each other I now declare you man and wife. Let it be a long kiss. Marie was very happy with their life and their home. She loved her children and that defined them as a couple. They had these "moments" together that she'd talk about where they'd relax with a glass of whisky in the evening. I like the image of them having a whisky and talking about their day. Many in the family thought it was a breath of fresh air that a priest could be like that. He was quite attention seeking. FREDERIKSSUND MARIA AND THOMAS' HOUSE "He told the victim that he missed intimacy." FROM GOTTHARD'S CONFESSION IN COURT "He'd told her he didn't love her as a girlfriend but only as a mum and wife. The victim suggested they see a marriage counsellor but he rejected this. They'd discussed this for years. He finally accepted it. He agreed to go because the victim asked him to." MARIA -Seriously? -It bounced off the table. We can't use that for anything. Maria had many sides. MARIA'S FRIEND LOTTE NYSTED She was a mum with a capital M. This was her forte in life. She was an incredibly talented psychologist. I never used her services, but she kept continuing her training because she loved her profession. She was passionate about patients. And she was funny. She was really funny. When I call her crazy I say it with love. She had this quirkiness. It was obvious when she spoke. She'd laugh loudly, but her laughter was always subtle. She was extremely attentive towards the people she was spending time with. She'd listen, talk and laugh a lot. She was intelligent. And thoughtful. And curious. Very curious. She'd make amazing mojitos. We had one of the funniest nights out together. We went out here in Frederikssund and had an amazing evening together. She'd come in and sit down and talk to the kids for a while. She became the centre of attention without doing anything to make that happen. She'd arranged the garden to make it work for her children. There was a space for her daughter to read and enjoy that and part of it was kept as a natural garden to attract hedgehogs. It was simple and homely. 21 OCTOBER, 2020 FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER "He'd searched online for a large feed bin. They're too expensive as new and no shop had one big enough in stock. The victim was 177 cm tall and weighed 75 kilos. She'd fit in the barrel." Thomas made a big deal out of Maria not being well when she disappeared. It's true that she'd been off sick with stress during the year but several relatives told us that she'd said she was well again and she was supposed to go to work on the Monday after she was killed. There's nothing to indicate that she was down in the dumps and on the Monday when he kills her her relatives thought what was going to happen was they'd spend the day together because it was Thomas' day off. She seemed normal that morning. She spoke with her sister and she didn't think she seemed depressed or in any way be planning to leave her family. We know Maria suffered from stress for a while, maybe due to Covid 19 or only socialising with very few people. We also know their marriage life wasn't going that great. It wasn't as good as it had been. "His experience with divorce wasn't good so he didn't wish to go through another divorce." FROM GOTTHARD'S CONFESSION "You concede defeat if you don't stand by your vows and you have to remember the children. Making it work with two ex-wives would be difficult." When we meet up for the last time on 4th October she's upset. She acknowledges that's it been difficult. I said to her: "Go home and drink a whisky together." She says to me with an almost expressionless look: "It's a long time since we drank a whisky together." It's a conversation that, like so often before, is characterised by us trying to identify a ray of hope and give each other input and feedback like: "I've been there myself." It'll get better. You try to look out for the other person. She did not criticise Thomas but she did say it was difficult. The circumstances made it difficult. She was upset. But she was getting better... She'd been depressed but felt she was getting better. They were planning on starting marriage counselling. So she was still positive despite being sad. When we said bye that last time it was with love and a twinkle in our eyes. I left feeling concerned about her. I was worried but also thought we'd have to keep more in touch. Do you remember your last words? I look at her and say: "See you soon, I'm sure it'll work out. It'll get better from now on." 25TH OCTOBER, 2020 THE DAY BEFORE THE MURDER "On Sunday he decided that the optimum moment for the death would be Monday while the kids were at school. He'd also decided that he wanted to avoid a scuffle at any prize and the best place to knock her unconscious would be in the garden. He wanted to hit her with something that wouldn't slash her body. He found a large, oval stone in the garden that would work. He found the stone on the Sunday. He was going to maintain that she had disappeared." What you try to establish as a crime reporter is why it happened and what went before? You also try to get inside the head of the killer. Why did he end up in this situation? To understand that we've reached out to Florence McLean. I don't think Maria has been Maria for Thomas from the moment he gets the thought in his head. When he starts thinking about killing her he makes her into a non-person. We don't know when he starts thinking about it. We have his explanation but I doubt, it happened at that time. I think he started thinking about it a long time before it happened. 26TH OCTOBER, 2020 THE DAY OF THE MURDER "He got dressed and went into the garden. She followed him. He breached his filter and resistance and thought that now he'd planned it he'd have to carry it out. He picked up the stone and hit her as hard as he could when she looked away." FROM GOTTHARD'S CONFESSION "She had no idea what was coming. She was wearing jeans, wellies and a hooded puffer jacket. He noticed blood seeping from her head but the hood absorbed it. She was unconscious. He covered her eyes with his left hand and her nose and mouth with his right hand and pressed down to stop her from breathing. He covered her eyes because he didn't want to confront her. He was wearing gloves because it was cold. He ensured that she was dead by taking his gloves off and confirming that she no longer had a pulse." What does it tell us about Gotthard that he hits Maria with a stone and subsequently strangles her? First of all he's really thought this through. The way he kills Maria by first knocking her unconscious with a stone and then, at least according to Thomas, strangling her, tells us he's been really determined and really wanted it because it actually takes a long time. He had the time to stop himself many times. but he doesn't. He carries on. "He got the blue barrel from the shed. He placed it next to the victim. He did not notice any activity around him but he could have been found out at that moment." FROM GOTTHARD'S CONFESSION "He closed the barrel with a padlock and used the church trolley to move the barrel into the shed. Later that day he collected the barrel from the shed and moved it to a temporary place he'd noticed on his way to work. The place was in Store Rørbæk." THOMAS BEGINS HIS WEB OF LIES The first person that's told about Maria's disappearance is her sister, Marianne. "Maria is missing." Marianne receives a text message from Thomas. He says she's missing. "I don't want anyone to worry unnecessarily..." The first text message is where it all began. That's where it all kicked off. MARIANNE MARIA'S SISTER Yes. He must have thought I was the best person to start this whole process. EKSTRABLADET What does he write? "Dear Marianne, please call me when you can. It's about Maria. She's been missing since yesterday morning. Her phone is turned off. The children and I are very worried. I did not sleep last night. Please call me so we can try to put things into perspective. I haven't told anyone else except my mum who was supposed to pick up the kids as I had some church business as I don't want to worry anyone unnecessarily. Regards, Thomas." Crazy. WE BELIEVED IN THOMAS He's trying to create a confidential space. "I haven't told anyone. Let's talk." He's trying to reel her in. And they do in fact talk. He tells her about this note she's left behind. It says: "Dear family. See you tomorrow. I love you." His explanation was that she was going to the cabin. Maria's car is missing so she might have gone to her parents' cabin. Marianne and her husband drive to our cabin to see if Maria is there. She's not, so we pick up the kids and go to our place. We get pizza for them in the evening. ABANDONED FARM STORE RØRBÆK THE NIGHT AFTER THE MURDER "The property had been abandoned. It was a trash-filled ruin. He knew this already. He brought the chemicals there and opened the barrel. At a distance, so he didn't have to look into the barrel, he poured all the hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide into the barrel." FROM GOTTHARD'S CONFESSION "Nothing happened when he added the acid but it started to boil, sputter and fizz when he added the sodium hydroxide. He noted that the figure in the barrel wasn't entirely covered. He put a lid on the barrel, locked it and covered it with tarpaulin and other items lying around." Thomas kept telling us she was exhausted and tired of life. He said she was feeling really down. It didn't add up. He claimed she'd been feeling very low on their autumn break. That wasn't consistent with the letters we received. -Text messages and pictures? -Right. We received pictures Maria had taken of the children. They'd be looking for amber and they'd tried a jacuzzi with hot water. It sounded like they'd had fun. It's a longer conversation. He tells me he'd hugged her and she'd cried a lot at night. How low she was feeling and how unhappy she was. He wasn't able to help her... You know. The family is looking for Maria. The police are also looking for her. There's nothing to suggest a crime has taken place. They're looking for someone who might have taken their own life. The police have issued the following description of Maria From Jakobsen. She's 177 cm tall, of average build and has shoulder-length light hair. On 26th October she was wearing a black puffer coat, dark trousers and black Ilse Jacobsen wellies. It was his plan to convince everyone she's disappeared voluntarily. That all the police resources were directed at looking for her away from where he was keeping her. There is an old instance in Maria's family where a remote relative committed suicide by jumping off the Oslo ferry. According to Thomas he told us that she was almost obsessed with this suicide. In the end the police look into whether there was something in it. Are there other examples of him creating a false trail to mislead others? Thomas sends Marianne a text message: "Maria probably seen by the Netto on Holmensvej at 3 pm. Going to look at the CCTV now. Please join. Exclamation mark." There was a... ...text message saying she might have been seen in the local Netto. We of course moved heaven and earth... We looked at the CCTV and he was adamant that the person might be Maria. -Right. -But you couldn't... -It made no sense. -It didn't. -It was obvious it wasn't her. -Yes. -But he claimed it might be? -Yes. He worked himself into a frenzy saying it could be her. You have to be quite callous and be willing to go far to look at CCTV knowing that it's not Maria because he's killed her himself. And yet he tells her sister the exact opposite. Right. She had an appointment at a psychologist so we went there to see if she'd show up. He slept on the way there in the car. He was the one left behind. We felt that since we'd never been left behind ourselves and if he felt that way there was probably a reason for it. Good for him that he gets some sleep. He also mentioned why he was tired, right? Generally it was because he'd been looking for her in Vesterbro at night because they'd liked walking around there at night. That's why he said he'd been there to look for her. At one point I ask him if he'd like to look for her in Copenhagen. There'd been suggestions she might be in specific places. He doesn't want to because his rain-wear isn't rainproof, he has a cold and the police had told us to just stand by. He seemed preoccupied. I might not have written to him every day, but there were days when he said he was too tired because he'd been looking for her all night. -Can you show me the text messages? -Sure. -Sure. -I'll join you. -This is just crazy. -He has renewed hope. Morning, Lotte... "Dear Lotte, morning. I'm as sound as a bell." He's trying to be funny. "I've slept a whole hour." So... And he tells you he doesn't want to go looking for her because he's caught a cold and his rain-wear... What he says here is that the rain-wear is not rain proof anymore. "It's pointless walking around aimlessly in Copenhagen." I must have asked if we should look for her. "Write..." Here it is. "Save your energy and pray for Maria at the next service. The police are vehement that we must be patient." Right. "His mood deteriorated and the children were upset. Everybody was in touch all the time." FROM GOTTHARD'S CONFESSION "He struggled to cope with the empathy he was shown." ANSGAR CHURCH HEDEHUSENE We are obviously worried about her and him. We thought he must be desperately concerned that his wife was missing. Do you contact him? Sure, all the priests meet up, convene, for the staff meeting. There is a collection and we send him our best wishes believing that the wife has disappeared. He mostly spoke with Marianne, because during the following weeks he became more unapproachable. He withdrew from us and seemed more gloomy. -When did you see him? -The Wednesday at Marianne's. He was there but left shortly after we arrived and seemed very reserved and told us he was going home to sleep because he couldn't sleep at night without Maria. The children spent a couple of afternoons here and would sometime spend the night. On those occasions he brought them. Usually when I dropped off the kids we'd go inside and have a chat. Now we'd only make it to the front door and the kids would go inside while Thomas blocked the door. He didn't want to let us in. -What did you think about that? -I thought it was strange. I began to think... What is this? Why aren't we allowed in the house? One time we brought a cousin who hadn't seen the kids for a long time and would like to say hello to them. But Thomas blocked the door. He wouldn't let her in. The fact that Thomas dissociates himself from others and won't let them into his home may indicate several things. One important aspect is that he's already moved on. He doesn't want to relate to Maria but he's forced to when they're there. They want to talk about her and their grief. He struggles with that because he has this knowledge he doesn't want to share, plus... I imagine he fears they'll find out. Does he give himself away? If he's looked into this he knows how the story goes. All murderers say too much sooner or later. By keeping them at bay he avoids what we call "spill over". He forgets that's suspicious in itself. That he keeps them at bay. WHERE IS MARIA? We called all kinds of silent retreats and psychiatric wards. They won't disclose anything but do so anyway when asked. They won't tell you whether someone has been admitted. But they will tell you that no one has been admitted that day. We walk around Vesterbro, Nørrebro and Østerbro. We visit the restaurants where she used to come when she studied there. We asked if they'd seen her and asked them to hang up the poster. We spent two days and night walking around Copenhagen including The Lakes area because Thomas implied she was so poorly that she was suicidal. You start thinking that if's she's that poorly she's an easy victim. Something could happen to her. That's why we focused on The Lakes. What did you think might have happened? I didn't imagine anything. I didn't know what to think. That some psychopath had killed her? Do you renounce Satan and all his works? Do you believe in God, the Almighty and Jesus Christ, his son... ...the Christian faith. 27TH OCTOBER, 2020 THE DAY AFTER THE MURDER "He pulled down the visor to hide. He parked the car and left the victim's driving license and keys inside the car and closed the door." FROM GOTTHARD'S CONFESSION The police don't have a lot of leads to go on. when Maria disappears. But even when she's first reported missing it's noted that her car has been caught on a traffic camera close to Brønshøj in Copenhagen. We ask the police if they can see who's driving the car. They won't tell us. Then the police ask Thomas and Marianne to go through the CCTV. If you're told the police have CCTV of the car and you're asked to come have a look at them that must be nerve-racking. He didn't know what information they had. 29TH OCTOBER, 2020 3 DAYS AFTER THE MURDER "He and Marianne reported to the police station in Hillerød." FROM GOTTHARD'S CONFESSION "The police told them they had a picture. He was sure they'd be able to see him behind the wheel but you could only see the car." Thomas Gotthard does everything to mislead everyone around him including the police, the family and friends about what may have happened. WE BELIEVED THOMAS Several of them can't make sense of it. That Maria should have left her children voluntarily makes no sense to her family and close friends. No one is suspecting Thomas at the outset, not even the police. During those weeks when she's missing no one knows where she is... CRIME REPORTER Everyone is perplexed as to where she might be. They look for her on the Oslo ferry and in allotment sheds. They even check whether she's caught a bus to Harzen. But they have no idea where she might be. They're searching for her, but it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. She's vanished into thin air, disappeared without a trace. MARIA FROM JAKOBSEN MISSING MARIA'S CAR IS FOUND A few days after Maria is reported missing the police find her car. Now they have pinpointed an area to search. There's a chance Maria might be in the area. Go door to door. Has anyone seen anything. Is there CCTV? Have they checked the CCTV? There is a voluntary organisation called "Missing Persons" which organises a search using social media of the area in question two weeks later. "MISSING PEOPLE" VIDEO FROM SEARCH -She didn't know the area. -No. They usually park in the side streets around Flintholm but not really here. It was a shock to discover, not that the car was there but that her driving license and keys were in the car because that might mean she'd driven to Copenhagen to commit suicide. It's mind-blowing that she's been here and walked off from here. I was worried that she might have gone to Copenhagen and become a victim of a crime. Or, based on what Thomas said, because we didn't know he was lying, maybe had rented a flat and decided to kill herself there. We have thought about what she might have done. Is there anything we've overlooked? Her husband asked me that question. I think there is a... It's a mysterious case. Something unexplained that makes it difficult to decide where to look. Their network and everyone they know are in shock. Because Maria is missing. No one can make sense of it. I'd think she'd know she could just reach out and people would help. That's the mysterious bit. ABANDONED FARM STORE RØRBÆK 1ST NOVEMBER, 2020 6 DAYS AFTER THE MURDER "The barrel was untouched. Using the headlamp he could see traces of the chemicals on the walls and ceiling." FROM GOTTHARD'S CONFESSION "When he opened the barrel large parts of the victim remained." BELLAHØJPARKEN Does Thomas Gotthard participate in the search? No, only the sister, some friends and colleagues participate but he does call the sister during the search to ask how it's going. We notice quickly if there is... It's Thomas calling. I don't know... It can wait a little. I have to call and find out what he wants. Is that okay? Yes, of course. I thought: "Amazing he has the energy. Why doesn't he join the search?" Hi, Thomas. What's up? -I'm just extremely curious. -Sure. -Can you hear what's being said? -I can. He says: "I'm just curious. Did you find anything?" Something like that. It's been a while but that's how I remember it. Listen... Can I call you back later? Great. Bye, Thomas. Do you hear anything from Thomas Gotthard? I talk to Thomas and tell him we haven't found anything. He seems very calm. He tells me he believes he's been in spiritual contact with her. Doesn't the person need to be dead to enable spiritual contact, I ask. He said he did fear that she was in fact dead. I thought that he maybe because of his job had this ability to sense souls in some way. What else do you talk about? I actually ask him again whether she may have left another letter. A suicide note that you haven't found. There's usually a note for the children. Is there anything about the chat that makes you suspicious? I think the spiritual contact aspect is weird. "The organisation Missing Persons had suggested he look for suicide notes in different places. This inspired him to put a note from the victim in his calendar. It was a page from her diary." I was surprised that it was supposed to have been written by Maria. She did write entries in her diary where she'd describe feelings in the extreme. But these were work related entries. You shouldn't take them out of context. The reason that Thomas finds various things, including the letter, is because he is urged to look for it. He's told to look for the letter and decides it's a good idea. Now he has something to show others. "There's something interesting." He's staging himself over and over again. "He drove to Finn's hunting lodge and found a suitable place. He does not recall being there before but felt it might be a suitable place to bury the victim. He covered the ground with leaves and sticks and rolled the big barrel back to the car." FROM GOTTHARD'S CONFESSION "The next day he took the barrel to the recycling centre in Jægerspris. Before that he'd cleaned it at the water's edge at the beach." The way Thomas treats the body is quite absurd. It's like he won't let go. He holds onto her, he holds on to killing her because he keeps going. He does say it turns into a kind of hobby. That makes sense. It's something he can't let go. Thomas starts driving around at night from the time Maria disappears to try to erase all tracks... He even sets fire to an abandoned farm. ABANDONED FARM STORE RØRBÆK "He thought he might be traced to Store Rørbæk and that police would find traces of acid on the walls. So he decided to burn the farm down. He figured the fire department would erase tire marks and so on." EKSTRABLADET ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE At the time of the fire it's not something we or the police connect to the Maria case. He's quite industrious at this time. FINN'S HUNTING LODGE SUNDBYLILLE "He'd found out there was a hunt at the place where he'd buried the victim. She might be found by a person or a dog. He decided to dispose of the victim by burning her." FROM GOTTHARD'S CONFESSION "He was unable to move the victim so made the terrible decision to dismember her and place her in two barrels. He found it difficult to manage. It was a hard job. He left the two barrels with the body parts and biked home." On the Friday we were meeting up at the restaurant where we'd usually meet for a Friday cocktail. We'd catch up and have a chat before heading home to the family. We were supposed to meet at 4 pm. I write to her: "Maria, come home. We're here." It's November. It's very dark and raining. The weather is terrible. We were looking into the darkness and waited. We didn't expect her to show up, of course, but we had to come to do something. Just by being here... I remember quite clearly that we had... a conversation where I told Lotte I thought something terrible had happened. I tell her to stop. "Don't say that! Stop!" As soon as you say something it becomes real. As long as you don't it's not real yet. She's not just missing. I couldn't think it through. I still remember the feeling of looking into the darkness. I was consumed by fear. We took a selfie and sent it to Thomas. Like an act of love. "We're thinking of you. We hope you'll manage. We're there for you. We hope the children will manage." Words like that. Did he answer? "Hi Thomas. Thinking of you..." I think he replied with a heart. "...I felt I had to come. Thinking of you." Thomas does not feel under pressure. Thomas is calm and collected. He's made his decision. All that matters is that Thomas is going to get away with murder. That's what he's trying to do. FOOTAGE FROM "MISSING PERSONS" SEARCH FOR MARIA Thomas changes from the pleasant conversation we had at night till now where his voice has changed... He tries to remain calm but his breathing has changed from the day before. He's concerned that we might drive Maria to suicide. Maria's a psychologist, he's a priest. He tells me they've had some deep conversations. About suicide because that's an aspect of both their jobs and he tells me Maria has told him that if she was ever to die that way she'd never want to be found. He asks me to stop the search and tells me the police agree with this decision. I'd never experienced a relative asking me to stop a search before. But I have to respect that. -What did you think? -When does the police station open? When can I talk to my police liaison because this is crazy. As soon as they open I call Nikolaj who's working the case at that time and tell him Thomas has called me to ask me to abandon the search as agreed with Nikolaj. Nikolaj tells me that's not something he's advised him to do. It's a lie. I trust my own eyes and I didn't believe Maria chose to leave. She wouldn't do that. So where the hell was she? Do you ever wonder if he might have hurt her? No. I didn't think that. I trusted Thomas. A friend asked me if we trusted Thomas. It almost irritated me. "Of course we trust Thomas." THOMAS GOTTHARD DID NOT RESPOND WHEN TOLD OF THIS PROGRAMME THANK YOU TO MARIA FROM JAKOBSEN'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS
