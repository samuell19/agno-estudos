Ready? Everything OK? Sorry, I didn't know that. Another fight? Ah... yes, now I feel it. Keita, can you pass it to me, please? - Yes. - Excuse me, go ahead. Ogawa didn't come to work? It didn't take. I'll be there, I'll hurry. Don't try to solve everything by yourself. - See you later. - Mom, it's your turn. We'll finish up later, okay? - Jiro! Come home, I have to go out for a moment! - What? - I have to go out! - Wait just a minute. So... ready, go! CONGRATULATIONS! Congratulations! Jiro, signs 3 and 4 are reversed, you have to reverse them. - Ouvs, sorry'. - one o'clock, what have you done? - Yes, he's right! - We have to do it right. Taeko! Good morning! See you later. Yes! My husband hasn't been to you, has he? - No. - He left very early to run some errands. - He didn't pass here. - What? - There is not here! I get it, he must have gone to play pachinko. Tell Jiro I'm going to look for him. All right? Mine will arrive at 11am. Excuse me! I'm late. - Oh yeah, you're late. - Did you take everything? - Yes, nothing is missing. - Safe? Look here! There are balloons. - They're cute, aren't they? - They are fantastic! - They have beautiful colors. Sorry, it was your day off. - Are they still arguing? -He had calmed down, but then he started again. This man dropped my phone. If he broke, what was I supposed to do? I just wanted him to stop taking pictures. - You dropped the phone! - We're not kidding! - Toda, stay calm. Do you mind if we go talk somewhere else? I've had enough. I have no time to lose. Toda, you've been drinking again. - It is not true. - Give me that bottle. It's fruit juice. It's not juice, it's booze! It will be a nice surprise, I'm sure. He doesn't expect it. - Good morning! - Greetings! - HI! - Where are you going? - Jiro said to wait for him at the bar after the rehearsal. - Ah... it seems he took it seriously. - Already. Keita! - Dad told me to come and find you. - How you grew up, Keita! - Come on, say hello. - Hi everyone! - HI! - HI! 11 do you remember them? You saw them at our wedding. - Otsuki... - Sì, bravo! - Otsuki, Tsuboi, Tomiyama. - Oh! - What a memory! Jiro talks about you very often. - And who am I? - So... - Come on! - You do not know him? - He is Kajiwara! - I was going to say that! - He's Hojyo instead... - Hey! - She instead... - Excuse me, I didn't come to the wedding. I am Yamalaki. Your husband has always been helpful to me. - Now it's better if we go, or we'll be late. - Certain. - HI. - We will see each other later. - See you later. - HI. - Later. - Bye bye. Mom, I'm ready. - Pay attention. - I'm good, you know. - Stand by Me. - Why didn't you call me? - I did, but you left your phone at home. - What? You always forget that. No, not always. This year is the third time. What? I do not think so. Yes, but yes. - No it is not true. - But yes. - It's not like you say. - I tell you it is. - You're back! - HI! Mom, do you want to play Othello with me? - Keita! - What's up? - Come and wash your hands. But why? Tomato sauce? It smells good. CONGRATULATIONS PEARL VFITORIA, KEITA - It's really nice. - Isn't that a bit too much? No, it's perfect. Othello! Othello! Othello! - All right... Whose turn is it to play? - It's your turn, mom. We see... And the. - What happened? - Huh? Did you have problems at the soup kitchen? Ah... a fight, as usual. Oh... You sorted it all out, I guess. - Oh! I was wrong to move. Can I try again? - Certain. - Did he beat you again? - Not yet. - Keita, you only play with your mom! - Do you feel left out? Oh yeah, yeah. - Keita, can you play with dad next time? - Agree. But it's a sucker. - It does not matter. - And then he grumbles. He's a big boy! Taeko, can you give me a hand? Apologizes. Ugh... - Can you make fried chicken? - Yes. - Where's the lemon? - It's in the fridge. Parsley too. - You know... I've met them all. - Below? - Yes. I didn't know a girl. - Uh... His name is Yamalaki. She didn't come to our wedding. I think he was sick. You talk to me all the time about your colleagues, but not a single word about her. Seriously? Does it have anything special? Ah... why do you say that? - Why is Yamalaki here? - Jiro said to bring people. - Huh? But don't you know? - What? She is Jiro's ex-girlfriend. Seriously? They were going to get married, but he cheated on her. That? Are you joking? With what is now his wife. - This is serious. - Embarrassing, I'd say. I don't understand... what the hell did she come for... - Where are you going? - In the bathroom. - Good morning. A flyer. - Speed ​​up, please. Watch! There is Jiro's father! Woh! He mustn't see us! FIRE TRUCK What's up? Excuse for before. I didn't have to say it. Don't worry, I'm not leaving. Yes I know. Will your father accept our union today? There is nothing to accept or reject. We are now married. - Yeah, I know, but... - Done. Yes! - Here they are. - I arrive! HI! Good evening everyone! Hi Keita! - You are late. - Yes, sorry. How are you? We are all here! Here we are! How beautiful! Sounds like your birthday. Congratulations on winning that game's tournament. - 0thello! - What? - It's not "that game"! It's 0thello! - You are right. - Isn't it a game? - He doesn't like to call him that. Ah okay... - Mr. Osawa, can I take your hat? - Yes. Ah, how many memories! Taeko, listen... does this thing work? - What? - There are a lot of pigeon droppings on our balcony. Ah, I don't know. It's more of a lucky charm than anything else. - Seriously? - Actually, I hope it works. Keita, stop playing. - I have not finished yet! - You'll finish later. Agree. - Don't walk on it. - No. - Can I turn it off? - Yes. - You won? - Certain! - Yes, yes! YOU CAN COME NOW - Well, guys, let's get going. - Agree. - You fell asleep? - Otsuki, I didn't pay. - Don't worry, Jiro gave me some money. - Here you go. - A thousand thanks. - Excuse me... I can not come. - Forgive me! - But... - Yamalaki, wait! - Hey, you, come on! Chase them! - I go! No. They are too fast. They were on the school track team. - And what about you? - In the book club. - What's up? - And now with the signs how do we do? Keita, you can watch. Oh! Are they for me? - Keita, darling, congratulations on the win! - Good boy! - Compliments! - Thank you all! Go ahead, open them. - What will it be? - We see... - Oh... - A book about animals! - 11 like? - Yes. - How beautiful! - I'm happy! You must know that your grandfather chose it. It is not true? This is from mom and dad. Who knows what it will be? He's excited! - An airplane! - A beautiful plane! How beautiful! - Is happy! She wanted it so much! - It's really nice! Look how my airplane flies! - You're happy? - Yes, a lot! Well, now we should go. We can't stay longer than we have to. What? No not yet. I'm going to make coffee. Come on, stay a little longer, please. Come on, sit down. Do you know them? one started going to tub. Oh... it was Taeko who convinced me. - Taeko, do you like to go fishing? - Yes. I grew up in the countryside. Mr. Osawa, you fish in the sea instead, don't you? Yes, certainly. I like it more. He gets on my nerves... He buys some very expensive fishing rods. Taeko, don't you think this is a nuisance? I only fish in rivers, I use a simple fishing rod. - A simple fishing rod? - I don't use any luxury accessories. Jiro instead prefers the sea. - Buy very expensive reels. - Yes, but I buy them used. - Used reels? - I buy them online. - I'm going to get coffee. - I'll give you a hand. Scraps will do, too, but they don't fit everything. What does it mean? It used to be… it was more difficult to find used equipment. Your mother is too nice to say. You know very well what we had to endure! Stop it, dad. Does that mean I'm the waste? That's not why we left the apartment for you! We wish we could have moved to the country, but we're here to help with the grandkids! And what have we achieved? Nothing what we expected! Absolutely nothing! 11 you behaved rudely. Now apologize to Taeko immediately! After you! Apologize to her. No, non serve. I want you to take back what you said. What he said about the scraps. Sorry, I exaggerated. All right. Thank you. Well... We are a family, we shouldn't fight. - Did you feel bad, Keita? - Actually no. Come on, let's have a good coffee. Honey, sit down. A thousand thanks. Calm. But we also want a grandson of our own. Mom, Taeko... - Honey, shall we go to the balcony? - Why? After you! Let's get some fresh air. Come on! - What is that? - You are ready? And go! CONGRATULATIONS! Congratulations! BEST WISHES FOR YOUR 65 YEARS Happy birthday! Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Happy birthday! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Mr. Osawa, congratulations! - Happy birthday! - Happy birthday! - Congratulations, Mr. Osawa! Thanks a lot to everyone! - Congratulations! - Dad... - Happy birthday! Mr. Osawa, happy birthday! Congratulations! - Ah, what beautiful flowers! - Oh thanks. I am happy that everything went well. - Taeko, thank you so much for today. - Not at all. Fantastic! - Thank you thank you! - Really good! Thanks for coming unannounced. - It was a pleasure! - It is we who thank you! Otsuki almost forced them! - Thank you for accepting. - It was a pleasure! - Honey, it's your turn! Come on, sing. - No... I don't want to sing. - You also went to Latvia! - Don't talk about it. - Really? - Yes, Latvians from "enka". - Let's hear how you're doing! Your grandfather is about to sing. - Alright then... - Yes, yes, sing! - sit next to me. This is an old folk song. Keita, don't run. I warn you: this canton has seven strophes. It will be great! Excellent! Excellent! - It's not over! - No? - No! Keita? Keita, come here! Keita, are you in the bathroom? Who! Who! Who! Keita! Age? Eh? What? - Age? - 34. Not hers, her baby's. He... YOU ARE al1I1I. He would have turned seven next month. Osawa Taeko, you are Keita's mother, aren't you? Yes. And Osawa Tuo 'and his father, right? Yes. But... it's not about family status. Keita is my ex-husband's son. Was he informed? That? Did you let the father of the child know? "0. We are divorced, I don't know where to find it. So she doesn't know? He left us when Keita was little. I never saw him again. Yes. Keita had it from her first husband. - Did you get married? - Yes, certainly. - When? Last July... we got married. Why didn't she adopt the child? Due to... family matters. Family matters? My father was against the marriage. - And she? - What? How did she feel about the baby? I... Keita was very fond of my husband. And... my husband was like a father to him. He acted like he was… the real father. But he didn't adopt it. "0. He would have adopted it from the beginning, if my father-in-law had agreed, but he didn't. Accepted what? Accepted me. We have the results of the autopsy. Cause of death is drowning following loss of consciousness due to concussion, but there are no prerequisites for carrying out a complete judicial autopsy. So it was an accident. The funeral home will arrive later. Taeko! I know, it's a huge pain! Poor girl! It's terrible! Yes. - You have to try to be strong, understand? - Yes. - Let's go. Here are the funeral homes. - Already? Keita cannot stay in the hospital. - Where will you take him? - At home, for now. - Uh... Ah... really? I want you to go back to your room one last time. Maybe... maybe but... Wouldn't it be better to have him taken away from the funeral home? - Why? Jiro, I don't want to. - What will the neighbors say? Honey, that's okay. Think about it. All our memories are in that apartment, what if... Ah... don't worry. - It's also Keita's house. Let's let him come back, okay? - No... Come on, calm down, huh? Come sit down. Come on... sit down. Be calm, calm down. Go hear about us. OTHELLO CHAMPION DROWNS AFTER FALLING INTO THE BATHTUB BE CAREFUL TO LEAVE THEM ALONE IN THE BATHROOM! HAPPY BIRTHDAY Keita! Do not rush! Take everything off? Yes. Why? In your opinion? Is it too heavy to see? No, I was thinking about you. A me? Yes. What do I do? Do I hang them up? I have. She takes everything down. Thank you. - You know what? You can say what you want, but I know it's my fault that Keita is dead. You are wrong. You say... that I keep forgetting... to empty the bathtub. You are wrong. If I let the water out, he wouldn't have died. Taeko! It wasn't your fault. What were you doing? We have to choose some photos of Keita. Mm... yes. Are you OK? I'll do it if you want. No, I'm fine. How many will be needed? "OH I0 S0. The funeral director said, about ten. - Videos are fine too. - Hm. - You don't just have these, do you? - Mm? Older. These were made after our wedding. Don't think about how I feel. Yes. How about... take a bath? We haven't done that for a while. Good evening. Can you explain to me what exactly this object is for? With this we pull the dough. - I don't want you to get cold. Drink some tea. - Well. - If you want, you can use our bathroom. - Thank you. Anyway... I'm sorry about this morning. I said awful things. You know it... all the people I have seen die in my life were older than me. It's the first time I've been so shocked. Don't worry. No one is to blame for what happened to Keita. And certainly not you. Please try not to blame yourself. - If she were a human being, she would be 60 years old. -She would be a grandmother. Hey, Taeko! - It's soft, isn't it? - Very soft. This way, please. Take one, please. Put them next to your face. Next to the face, please. Take one, please. Please. Next to the face, please. Take one, please. Next to the face, please. Take one too. A flower for her. Take a flower, please. A flower next to the face. Please, a flower for her. Here, take it. She put it next to her face. - A flower. She-she Put it next to your face, please. Ma'am, if you like, you can take a flower. Please take a flower if you like. Do you want to take a flower? Sir, please take a flower if you like. Sir, would you like to take a flower? Taeko, do you know him? He is Keita's father. Sir, take a flower. Greetings. Are you Keita's father? What does he do? What did he do?! Come, let's go to the office. Come with me. - Come with me! - Get out of here now! Taeko... REPUBLIC OF KOREA PASSPORT Taeko! - Sorry, I arrived late. - Calm. My... most sincere condolences. Ah! Leave it, I'll take care of it. - There's no need. - No, really, leave it to me. I have plenty of time to do it. I'll handle that. For the love of heaven! Excuse me. Sorry, I made you uncomfortable. It does not matter. - If you want... we can do it together. - Yes! - Will you be doing your rounds tonight? - Um... yeah. - In the north sector? - Yes. Can I come with you? What do you say? - Yes please. - Yes, but... - What is it? - Nothing. Everything is fine. Good evening. Everything is fine? This is next week's meal plan. - Do you want an onigiri? - Yes please. - Hold on. - Thank you thank you. - Let us know if you still need help. - Certain. - Well. Leave it close by. At that time... I control the park. Can you finish here? Yes. I am sorry. For leaving or hitting me? For both. You hurt me. Very bad. In both cases. Excuse me. They arrived last year. I assume they are from your father. - Didn't you open them? - Exact. I remarried. Congratulations! Why did you run away? Tell me. I can't explain it to you. I can't forgive you. I know. Anyway, now I've given you the letters. We say goodbye forever. FOR THOSE VISITING THE CHURCH FOR THE FIRST TIME Mom, what did you want to talk to me about? Ah… yeah, right. - We were thinking of moving. - As? We're sorry it happened so suddenly, but we found the right solution and we didn't want to let it get away. Don't think it's because of what happened to little Keita. We've wanted to do this for a long time. In any case, listen to us... yes, you will be freer, don't you think? Of course, if you two are happy, then I have nothing to say. We don't want you to think it's an escape. We've been thinking about it for a while. I'm going to take a bath. Taeko, if you want, you can go home hearing from me. - Tsuboi? - Yes? - Who is handling the Kushida case? Yamalaki, but it's not there. So Kajiwara takes care of it. - Not even today? -Yes She's not doing so well, she's staying at her parents' house. - Osawa, I'll take care of it. - I have, thank you. All right. SOCIAL SERVICES - Sorry... - Yes? - There is a deaf-mute person who needs help. I'm looking for someone who knows sign language. Is there no one in the central office? Well, he's a peculiar person. It seems to be Korean. Oh... I'm sorry, but I don't know how to help you. Yes, I see. - I come. - A thousand thanks! - HI. Good morning. - HI. - What happens? A person requires assistance and needs someone who knows sign language. Ah, I understand. What's up? I want to apply for the subsidy. Why so suddenly? Does it need to be a reason? Not really, but... What... what does he want? Excuse me. He's here to apply for the subsidy. Ah, so that's why. Excuse me... would you mind staying on as interpreter? "0. A thousand thanks. His name is... Park Shinji? Yes. Park Shinji. So... what is your nationality? - Do you always have the same nationality? - Yes. He is Korean. - Were you born in Japan? - No, in Korea. His father is Korean and his mother is Japanese. - You know him well. - That? That would be... really helpful. Actually, I don't know much about him. Typically, requests for assistance are accompanied by many documents. -Osawa? - Oh, sorry. Forgive the wait. Here is the document. It's freezing in here... We'll catch a cold. What are you going to do... with Park? I don't know, I'm not dealing with it. - What about your visa? - What? You don't have a conjugal visa? Doesn't have it anymore? It was revoked when we divorced, but he obtained a residence permit. And the subsidy? - They refused it. - Uh... He has not registered as a foreigner in this region. Can't you handle it? - What? - Park's case. - I? - Hmm.? Why? Because of sign language. Shouldn't you do it? Ma... You don't have to worry about me. It's not you I worry about. The thing is, you're the only one who can help him. There is no one else. If you want to help him, I think you should. As a social services executive, I think you have to do this. And as a husband? Be III. It's best that you meet without my knowledge. Where did you live? In the park. For a long time? Sometimes I slept in a shelter, others in an Internet cafe. Otherwise I'm there. What kind of work do you want to do? Anything would do. - What times do you prefer? - I have nothing else to do. I have no problem working hard to earn something. Clean it on the sides and back. Above and inside. Yes, OK. It has arrived. Now they unload the truck. Ready? Here we are. - They told me you were dumped. - Shut up... - HI. - HI. This weekend I go with my parents. All right. The move will be tiring. And then I'll help them with the paperwork. Yes, it's a good idea. At that time... Do you want to take a bath? Why? We can't keep going to my parents' house. We must try to move forward. Were you in our apartment? Jiro was so small... Ah... he was only two years old. So cute! Look, here she is crying. I don't know why, but... she cried often. - Where is Jiro now? -He's taking a bath. You can tell it's him, huh? Yes. It remained the same. There will be water and electricity until it is sold. - You can continue to use the bathroom. - Thank you. - I didn't know you smoked. - Occasionally. It relaxes me. - Can I have one? - Do you smoke too? - When I was alone, I smoked a lot. How is work going? Everything OK? Yes. Although… it feels weird to say it right now. The church I attend has a soup kitchen. Pausing to observe, I realized that the work you do is very noble. No, I wouldn't say. Taeko, are you a believer? Is that why you do it? No. Faith has nothing to do with it. It just happened. Seriously? You have been guided. - What about her? - Mm? Has anything changed since you attended that church? Good question. To be honest, actually, I still don't know. But after... what happened to Keita, I thought a lot. I realized how powerless we are. For all of my life I have lived without any religious faith. But... as much as I may have read about science and philosophy, I realized that nothing can protect us. - But from what? - Huh? - Protect us from what? Well, I mean... I don't know, from death, for example. Actually... I've never really believed in God. It's the truth, I've just... started to explore faith. Do you know what? I hope I have time to believe it, before my death. In time? If I had faith, would Keita still be alive? It's not that. Saving a person does not mean preventing him from dying. What I'm afraid of... it's the idea of ​​dying alone. “Ouch she has her husband and litho. I'm always alone. We cannot die together. I'll be back as soon as possible. I will let you know. - Listen to me. - We will see each other. Earthquake. Earthquake. Earthquake. Earthquake. Earthquake. Earthquake. Earthquake. Earthquake. Earthquake. Earthquake. Earthquake. Earthquake. I am fine. Some things fell, that's all. And you? I am fine. We are far from the epicenter, we didn't realize it. Watch out for other aftershocks. Anyway... thanks for coming. - So you didn't forget. - Mm? That my parents live in this area. Ah... When I saw that mountain, it came back to me. Have you finished moving? We've finished unloading the van. The real work starts tomorrow. I can't come and help you, that would be strange. Yes indeed. Just a little. - I'm sure they hate me. - Who hates you? - Your father and mother. No... What if my father always said he wanted to meet you? Really? Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Excuse me. Calm. - I'm happy to see you well. - Thank you. - You've been away from the office for a while. - I know I'm sorry. - I have to go, it's getting late. - Wait. Can I see you again before I go back to your house? You can stay here for a while. You will leave when you have saved something. Thank you. Do you work tomorrow? No. I have the day off. Then I'll come to you at 15:00. Let yourself be found. Where we are? It's my house. You are staying at my husband's parents' house. They just moved. Where's your husband? It's not there at the moment. I feel uncomfortable. Why? We don't do anything wrong. KEITA, 5 YEARS OLD KEITA, 6 YEARS OLD It's Keita's last game. He was playing with me. I learned that he died thanks to Othello. THE FUNERAL OF OTHELLO CHAMPION KEITA OSAWA WILL BE HELD ON THE 28TH I need your help. - Meaning what? - Only you can help me. When you left me, my world collapsed. I am sorry. It's all right. That's what happens when you break up. It's really strange, but the first person that comes to my mind is the guy I was engaged to in high school. I suddenly left him because I liked someone else. But after I told her, she burst into tears. I had never seen a boy cry like that before. I was very cold to him, he seemed so pathetic... But, when you left me, I understood what he had felt. Anyway... I don't hold a grudge against you. We have to meet at work. We can't feel embarrassed all the time. And yet, when I met your wife, I couldn't help but hate her. How could she smile and be so nonchalant? I've never told her about you. You really are a coward. You know this, right? I'm pretty sure he realized I was your ex. That day... the look he gave me... he was pitiful and condescending. I'll never forget it. You're giving it too much weight. Maybe you are right. But I remember thinking that I wanted to… that something bad happens to you, something... that destroys your lives. But then... after wishing it, that thing happened to Keita! So I have to apologize now. I am a horrible person! I would have bet on it. Even in a si tu al io ne like this one. What do you want to say? You just can't... to look people in the eye. Everything OK? It's enough? Stay still. Keita died because I forgot to empty the tub. Keita died because I forgot to empty the tub. It wasn't your fault. You're lying. You thought it was my fault. So you slapped me, right? Yes. But at that moment I was very angry. But I have no right to blame you. When you hit me, I thought it was unfair. But it is right that the death of Keita provoked such an angry reaction. Keita died in a horrible way, yet everyone was looking to get used to his absence as quickly as possible. But you... you were different. Your first reaction was anger. - First batch. You can make your offers. - To me! To me! - I want it! - I want it! You two! Left! 11,500 yen. Alright, now let's move on to the next batch. They are items that are 19 years old, but are in perfect condition. So who offers more? Who offers more? - 12,000 yen, the gentleman over there! - 14,000 yen! - 14,000 yen! - Awarded! - I can't believe it... - I offer 15,000 yen! - I wanted it, damn it! - The last offer! - 425,000 yen! Come on, stop it! Stop messing around! Come on, that's enough! Where's Taeko? Where's Taeko? Curse... TAEKO HAS GONE TO GET FOOD FOR THE CAT, COME BACK NOW AGREE I EXPECT IT HERE Park... You are a real selfish. Te ne vai, torni... You have no idea how much Taeko has been looking for you with all his strengths. He reported you missing. He started his current job. I have witnessed all of this. I helped the woman I love find the man she loves. Taeko had finally managed to forget you. And now you show up again. Because your son died. You abandoned them for four long years, but now you come back crying. I'm the one who should be crying. I lived with Keita for a year, I wanted to cry with Taeko. But it didn't help, I couldn't. You know what I thought when I saw Keita's body? "I have to hurry up and have my own child with Taeko." It was despicable! I was so filled with self-loathing, but then along came you. You and Taeko cried together. Like a married couple. You are a real selfish. Jiro, are you back? Sorry, she didn't know where to go. Stop that... It just is! Now finish it! The cat has escaped. She said the cat ran away. It is not here? He's gone. Do you think he fell? Kitty! I can not find it. Not even I0. The cat likes you very much. I would like you to keep it. Thanks for everything. Hey! Let him go. Why?! I don't want it to go away! He's decided, you can't stop him. No, I have to stay with him. That's enough now. He's always managed to get away with it. And what do you know, Jiro? He's weak, and I have to protect him! Do you understand this? He's not weak. Hello Ms. Osawa. There is a letter for her. International mail, forwarded from your old address. It's for... Mr. Park. - And he. - Ah! Until we meet again. It's from my family. My father is very sick. - Your father? - Yes. In Haman, Korea. He's very sick. I have to meet him at the hospital. Can you give me a loan? His father is very ill. He wants me to pay for the trip. Travel? For where? Korea. I believe it is near Busan. - lito... - Mm? I also saw Park once again. Eh? Just before you asked me to marry you. Keita, you and I had gone out for a walk. I happened to look towards the park, and there he was. Hey, Taeko! It's beautiful next to the dog! So... I've already abandoned it once. No it is not true. He was the one who abandoned you and Keita, understand? - How long have we been doing this? - What? Talking without looking into each other's eyes. You don't have to get over Keita's death. They will tell you to forget about it and move on. But you mustn't forget Keita. Trees'. It is an important part of your life. What was he saying? He was waving. I'm sorry, but I can't leave it alone. Taeko, get in the car! Taeko! Taeko! Taeko, does that mean you're going with him? Excuse me. What are you doing? It will be difficult for you alone.
