The most beautiful day of my life was the birth of my daughter Valentina. The second most beautiful day is today, because Valentina is marrying my assistant, Carlo. The third day will be when Valentina gives me my first grandchild. - True? - Bravo! Fantastic speech! Rich in content. Did you like it, Sergio? If I ate a dictionary and shit words, it'd come out better. Don't say that! You're lucky, Carlo's a good kid. I just hope my daughter Marta will be as lucky. Did I tell you she entered the Conservatory? - She plays... - The violin. No, the piano. Know what it costs me? Twenty-five years of installments. I just hope my daughter doesn't take up with a boatie. A what? Is today a time for bullshit? I bet if your daughter were marrying a gypsy, riff-raff in tow, you wouldn't be so happy. What do you mean? - If she's happy, why not? - It's democratic. - You'd accept it too. - Watch your gestures. Your daughter has a boyfriend but hasn't said who. My daughter has no boyfriend. - No? - No. If so, she'd have told me. Right, you're her father... I was ill-informed. Exactly. - Who told you? - You. Me? No way! Coming? Who told you? They're about to enter. - He didn't tell me. - What? I didn't tell you that. Who told you? Never a truce, you're always pissed off! He's a hick, I can live three years on what this wedding costs. Even four, he wants to humiliate you. Best wishes, Carlo. Where is she? It's so late. - Are you mixed up with someone? - No! Why? Why not talk about this one? What's up, Sara? Mom, I'll tell you when it's time. Careful... Dad's here! - Do you have a boyfriend? - No. - Tell the truth. - No, absolutely not. I'd tell you, don't worry. Excuse me... Paola, where's our daughter? I don't know, she must be outside. - She has to play! - Let's look for her. It's Sunday just one day a week. Please, the music! Turn it down, you're near a church. For heaven's sake! - What the fuck do you want? - We've got a wiseguy! What do I want? Police, license and registration. - Dad! - Marta? Darling, what are you doing here? Simone's a friend, we're in school together. I'm sorry, I didn't know you were Marta's father. If I wasn't, you could send me to hell? Episode closed. Antonio. - Blondie. - I see that. What's your name? It's my stage name, I play music, my name's Simone. - Paola, her mother. - Forgive me, Simone. The music you were listening to is crap. - It's Simone's, he's a rapper. - That changes things! - What's that? - This? A Drum, to save on cigarettes. She's a bit old-fashioned, a Drum! - Can we go? You have to play. - Be there right away. Right away! Goodbye, it was a pleasure, I hope to see you again. - Maybe not. - Yes... - I'm coming. - A shit impression! - I told you. - He's really a cop. She's coming! Uncle, she's coming. Sweetheart. - You've been crying? - A little, my emotions. I know what you mean! I couldn't sleep last night, thinking of you in your crib... Remember? I love you, Daddy I'll start crying again. Let's go, he's waiting. You're so lovely. Here we are. My Lord! - You're splendid. - Thank you. Beautiful. Wait! I want to say I love you very much. I've never seen her. She's a child! Who are you? You'll be unhappy forever, you know that. You don't have to get married, Vale. Who's she? You don't know her, she's joking. Sorry, Dad. Sorry for what? Where are you going? - Good for you, darling! - What's going on? Is this a joke? Wait. - Do I start? - Wait till the door opens. Stop! Honey, stop! THREE PERFECT DAUGHTERS It's for Your Own Good I pee on the cop's car Sleep on a sack of straw, gun under my pillow Put the drugs on that plate, got a leash on this whore I melt pills under my tongue bind her thighs with my belt... Marta? Paola, turn the volume down! - What is it? - It's Blondie, your daughter's friend. The guy at the church? In 3 songs he threatens to shoot someone, in 7 he talks about joints and in the others he fucks the first at hand. - Forbid her to see him! - You do it this time. I'm sick of being the jackass mom and you the understanding dad. Why stare at me like that? You're scared? You arrest criminals, how can you be scared of your daughter? - I'm going out. - Bye. - Be back late? - Oh, Dad, c'mon! - What are you doing? - Following her, she has a boyfriend. - I know. - You know? Everyone does. - Why am I always the last to know? - Because you lose control. - What did the shrink say? You must... - Count to 10. - Who is he? - I don't know, he's a photographer. He's a photographer and? Anything else? Where he's from, his age, his name... I don't know, Sara won't say anything. Shit! Count. One... Two... Good. - I'll go change. - Four. Five. - Six! - Six. - Do you know where my husband is? - No, ma'am. Arturo, you're smoking? You quit 15 years ago. - Don't be this way, you're overdoing it. - Overdoing it... - You take drops to sleep. - But I'm trying. And I don't want to try. Carlo cries all day at the office. His family wants me dead. I took a mortgage for a useless house and you scold me because I'm smoking? - Soon I'll be shooting up. - Meantime, take this. I defend these people. You don't know them, they come from far away, they want a place to hang their hats. Is the man I married sitting here in front of me? I'll pretend I didn't hear that idiocy. - Get a good night's sleep. - Who'll sleep anymore? - Forty drops. - How many? Forty, - But don't add apples. - Why? - They absorb all the juice. - All you taste is lemon. - Good morning. - Look who's here. Good morning! What were those drops? I couldn't wake up. What an exaggeration! They do me no good anymore. You're taking sleeping medication again? It's not easy when you realize you never knew your daughter. How alone she must have felt. You've always had a wonderful relationship. But now we shouldn't console one another, we can now speak the truth. I understand her, I'd feel much worse in your place. I mean we mustn't feel we're the only ones responsible for what happens to our daughters. Well, I don't want that Blondie in the house. Know what we'll do? We'll kick the invaders out, threaten them, ruin their lives, until they leave our daughters alone. I'm kidding! Don't you remember the messes we got into? Not us, you, actually you two. In fact, Dad said we married three idiots. No... I'll go. Anyway, this idiot wanted a grandchild. Just so... Our daughters aren't the problem, they are. Help me understand. You want to scare away our daughters' boyfriends? Then let's let them ruin our girls, okay? We've made sacrifices for them for ages. No, we've made sacrifices, not you. Count me out, remember, I wear a uniform. It's your problem, I don't even know who Sara's with. I trust my daughter, I taught her well. You didn't teach her, you locked her in. She'll go out now, and you'll see. Why wish your misfortune on others? - He's right. - Sergio, what do you know? Nothing, I know more about your daughter than you. Don't take it out on us if your daughter is shacked up with a girl. What an asshole you are! I'd better go or I'll tell you both to fuck off. Better, go fuck off. He told us to fuck off? He's suffering. - You've started smoking again? - No... yes. But just for a time. Let's be frank, you taught me certain values, if now it bothers you that I'm with a woman, maybe also because she's black, you have to say it straight out. I don't care that she's black or a woman, it's entirely your choice, but you ran out on your wedding day! Sorry, I'm worried about your mother, she's taking sleeping medication. Why stick me in the middle? You two never hide anything, you gab all the time. Admit you don't accept that Valentina is with a woman. To your happiness, Dad Of course not, it's just a crush. Valentina has never liked women! - How do you know I never liked women? - Who told you that? Me? When? Who told you that? I made a mistake, I loved you too much. To make you happy, I chose a life you dreamed. Your work, your boyfriend, it doesn't work like that. I have to look for my happiness, not yours. Huh, what am I looking for? My priority is your happiness. - So we can invite Alexia to dinner? - To...? Arturo, the client's been waiting for half an hour. Carlo, why don't you take initiative? Talk to him yourself! Sorry... I'm not ready for this dinner yet. I mean, I too... When do you want this dinner? Just out of curiosity, that blond guy... - What's the relationship between you? - Why do you ask? You know me very well, you already understand. In fact, I told Mom: no way Marta's having a fling with that guy. In fact, it's not a fling. - Dad, I'm in love. - What, in love? I'm scared Mom will get in the middle, she's so prejudiced. - Mom is... - I know what she's like! I can just see her listening to Simone's songs and saying: "Marta, never see this boy again". - If she did, what would you do? - I don't know. No more bans, Simone is special, don't judge him on three songs. Not just three songs, the whole compilation! It's a good thing you're here! Will you help me with Mom? Great, thanks! I invited him to dinner on Thursday, you tell Mom. Thursday? Happy Birthday! - Where's Sara? - In the kitchen, she's coming. Stay there... It's for my daughter. It's her birthday tomorrow. - Nice, isn't it? - Hello there. Luigi Poggi? Don't you remember me? Yeah, you're younger. - You're Sandro! - No. - Silvio. - Sergio. Yeah, but you're heftier. You haven't changed a bit. You don't know how I envied this guy, he laid them all. An assembly line. - Are you married now? - It's not my thing. So, you're still... You've got life figured out! Those? Fresh flesh on the scene? - Actually, she's quite young. - Is she good pussy? Pretty much. You got it Poggi! Stop! Dad! Antonio's magic mix. Was I right? Are they together? Woman's intuition! But, just a tad. - They're together, but just a tad. - Just a tad. - You're demented. - Why? Instead of forbidding her to see him, you invite him to dinner. You're not her father, you're her classmate. You're wrong, it's a tactic. By forbidding, you get the opposite effect, by inviting him, we show him up as a imbecile. Leave it to me, I have a plan. Smell the scent of this basil. - So, you have a plan. - Am I a fool? Then there's no worry. - Want a mozzarella? - No. In my country, wealth is in the hands of the very few who live in big villas with guards and waiters. - How did you meet? - At your firm. - Are you a lawyer too? - No, you defended me. The company I worked for accused me of theft. But it wasn't true, the company was pouring toxic waste into the river, Alexia exposed them and they framed her. - There's a conviction. - But we're appealing. - We, who? - Our firm. It's thanks to you that we met. It's nice your firm works half a day pro Bono. Too bad you also defend companies who have no respect for the environment. Alexia is a militant ecologist. - That's nice. - Yes! Thank you. Sorry, may I ask you not to smoke at the table? I quit 3 years ago. 3 years? - Here's the first course. - What is it? - Pasta with fish. - I can't eat it. - I'm a vegan. - What the fuck! He seems surly, but he's a good guy. - Right? - Yes. Like it? - How's school? - Fine, a couple of D's. You can't expect to get straight A's like Marta. Because the others are all F's. I'm not interested in school, those with degrees are all unemployed. - Why not drop out? - For my mother. It means a lot to her and I feel a moral obligation. - I'm just interested in music. - He already does gigs. He played at the Green Center yesterday, Aren't they all squatters? - You're interrogating him? - No, just to talk. - How do you see yourself in ten years? - In jail. I've no crystal ball, but I hope to be rich. The right sound can take you anywhere today. Before you get that sound, what job will you have? - Ya keep talkin' 'bout jobs! - Did we slip into dialect? Sorry, my mother works 12 hours a day in a laundry and has nothing. You have a hard job too and run risks every day. - That's true. - What do you make? I can't tell you... 1,400 euros, without overtime. With overtime maybe 1,450. In two years, that'll be one gig for me. Dad, we want to tell you something. We've thought about it a lot. We want to have a baby. How lovely! Vale says having a grandchild means a lot to you. Don't worry, we'll get married first. Alexia needs it for her citizenship. - A mulatto grandchild! - It depends who donates the egg. - Of course. - We'll do the tests and... Certainly, in Europe, I mean, I think it's still illegal in Italy. Arturo, you know about these things, don't you? Come and help me. Everyone in here, surprise! Surprise. Another surprise! - Mom, what are you doing? - Something in the safe. - Who'll hold this? - Guess. Mom? What are you doing? The keys to the new house and your grandmother's necklace for when you get married. Didn't you give it to her for the other wedding! Can I tell you? I never liked Carlo. He's such a twit. Nice! I'll go take the ice cream from the freezer. - Well, your plan? - Leave it to me? During interrogations, you first put the subject at ease and then strike the blow. Strike, ask him if he uses drugs. Excuse me. Here's Dad's scaloppini. Just the way you like them, cheese and ham... A bit crusty. Like Mom. Want some? - Another? - Gladly. Just one for Mom, she's on a diet. Like Dad. Would you pass my plate? Thank you. Simone, listen... in your songs, you always talk about joints, why's that? They're songs! Think Perry Como believed the moon was a pizza pie? I don't know, I don't think so. You speak about whores. Baez knew the House of the Rising Sun? Who cares about Joan Baez? Do you use drugs or not? - I should say no. - Say no. - Please. - I want to be truthful. I smoke an occasional joint. You have some nerve to tell a cop that. It's late, I'll walk Simone to the car. - The scaloppini? - I don't want it. - C'mon! - Coming. Good evening, it was all delicious, I hope to see you again. - Take a scaloppini to your mom. - Next time, thank you. - Come right back. - Goodbye. Why don't you let me do my job? Small steps. If you see someone smoking a joint, you frisk him. You said nothing to him! - Did he light up a joint? - Resolve this situation! Hi. How is he? Good night, darling. I washed the dishes and the floor. - Be quiet, mute. - Windows too... Eight hours in the emergency room. Good thing he didn't break anything or you'd be reported, by your daughter. I know, I saw red. He's a pedophile! - Your daughter is 20, she's of age. - Not yet. Means nothing, he could be her father, her grandfather! If he'd had a son at 14 and that son, at 13... I've always been able to make Sara reason. Now, because of you, she hardly talks to me. From now on, Luigi Poggi no longer exists for you, okay? - Okay? - Okay. - Where are you going? - To bed. No, you'll sleep on the couch. Do something like that again and I'll leave you, I swear. - Got the keys? - Yes. How's your plan coming? I'm waiting for the right time to claw him down. Hello, Marta's coming. - What's this music? - What a ruckus! My God, what a mess! They smoked a joint! - That's the limit. - Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it's incense. What are you wearing? We have to talk. I can't, Simone's waiting. I don't like Simone, he doesn't study, doesn't work. - He has no future plans. - You're a ballbreaker now too? He clawed you first. - The gang's base. - My compliments for the portal. Super discreet! How chic! - You own upstairs too? - Naturally! Look at all the dough he's made! - How many clients fit in here? - I don't bring them all together. Briefings are upstairs? Also. - Got a fridge? - Everything. - Do we want to talk about the plan? - Yeah! So, let's. For the jerk tagging after my daughter, we get a call girl, film him in secret and blackmail him. What? It's illegal, I'm a lawyer. I'm a cop. You're both chickens, hypocrites. Why not ask him with "please"? Send flowers. - Is this a procession? - A museum visit? It takes psychology with these people. I'd have remodeled better here. - Where are you going? - What the hell's this? My daughter, Valentina, is jealous. Excellent! I have a perfect idea for you. Why start with your daughter? - It's a bathroom! - It's confusing. It blends with the wall. - Yeah, why is Valentina first? - It was my idea. Why not in alphabetical order? Antonio, Arturo. - I always get it in the ass. - Is it my fault your name's Sergio? Let's start with Blondie. Well, what's Blondie like? What's he want from life? Fundamentally, he wants three things. Money, money and money. What's the problem? We'll give it to him, a bribe. Take those stinking feet off. - Sergio, let us talk. - He'll leave Marta for money. Excellent idea, simple but precise. I didn't know bribery was legal. Bribery, what a big word! It's for their own good. We have to call him, who'll call? Rule 1, never the one concerned, meaning me. Me neither, I'm in the public eye. Of course! Sergio, you have to call. Does that mean I count fuck or I'm worth fuck? Let's make this call. Rule 2, never use our own phones. Eight hundred? At least a thousand euros. - You pay. - I have to pay for all three? You've got it. Aren't we a gang? We each have a role. - He takes the risk, you lay the budget. - And you? I'm the brain. Look at this! Your jealous daughter. A nice black and white. Not even an expert would know. Okay I'll lay the budget, no more than 500 euros! Yeah? - Simone Castroni? - Who's this? - Someone in love with Marta. - What's that to me? Shut up, don't piss me off. If you leave Marta, I'll give you a thousand euros. 500! - A thousand. - Let's make it 750, okay? I want 5 thousand. - Maximum 1,500. - 4 thousand. - 2 thousand. - 3 thousand. Tomorrow at 4 p.m., in the trash bin outside the Green Center. Hello? I don't intend to give him 3 thousand euros! - I don't have it. - Me neither. She's your niece, you've always adored her. Yes, but I won't give him 3 thousand euros. You're sure? And these two? - What are you doing? - Rip it up! What, rip it up! I'll pay, but I want a couple of photos with a man too. - So she'll see how false she is. - A threesome? That's wrapped up, now, for my pervert, I insist on a call girl. No, if he's a womanizer, he has a lover for sure, just follow him. We'll tail him 24/7, three shifts, Arturo starts. - I work. - But we do fuck-all? - Pay someone. - I have a retired ex-colleague. - With 650 euros, way back... - Pay back? No, way back, he wanted 650 euros, now I don't know. Maybe a little less... Pull the money out! Wait! There he is! He took the money. Hello? Never see her again or I'll beat you to a pulp. The phone! It's mine! Who gives a shit. One x-ed out, now let's think about your daughter. We'll send her the photos and two x-ed out. Yes? Perfect. Thank you. It was the detective. Your daughter's boyfriend is kissing a redhead. He's taking a video. Sergio! Where's he going? Cool down, they'll arrest you. Don't do anything stupid. Goal! I won. You bastard! - Sergio! - Dad! Dad! That's it, I never want to see you again. - Let's go. - She dyed her hair! Don't let her see you like this, it's worse. Up with morale. Be peppier, okay? I've never been peppy, how can I now? - Then Isabella's right. - About what? Only a jerk would use a photo of Brad Pitt. - Valentina... - Dad, don't defend Carlo! I'd never do such a thing. The boy's suffering. But he's a good kid, look what hair! - He committed a crime. - I swear, I never... Don't justify yourself! Let's show we're men. Let bygones be bygones. Changing the subject, don't worry. Do you think we can do this appeal? - I swear, I never... - What do you swear? Holy crap, you're half alive. You ugly moron! You put your hands on him again. No, on the chair, I didn't touch him. I've been holding this in for years. It's not easy to face problems alone. Otherwise the cowboy shoots. But I accept it because you're wild and I love you for it. I love you, too. I'm not done. I can't take it anymore. Either apologize to Luigi or leave the house. If 10 isn't enough, count to 10 thousand. You finish up. Surprise! Marta's coming back, want to wait for her in there? - Yes, thank you for listening to me. - Not at all. Excuse me. - What the meaning of this? - I talked to him. I discovered lots of things. Are you all right? So-so... Tell me what he said. His grandfather died. His grandfather? They were very close, he's trying to get on his feet with music. On the Internet it says rap is an outcry of pain. An outcry of pain? For his grandfather? His sensitivity is disarming. And YouTube offered him a 3-thousand-euro contract. Three thousand? Know what he'll do with it? Go to London to study English and he's taking Marta, he'll pay for her. With the 3 thousand euros... The kid's generous. - You aren't going to agree. - We'll see. This boy thinks of the future! I listened to his songs again and the lyrics have something. I think he'll end up at Sanremo. Have you smoked a joint? Get a hold of yourself. The boy has a heart of gold. He heard my cell phone was broken, look... It's Arturo's... the model, identical. Simone gave me his! He gave it to you. Very generous! Forgive me, darling. You were right not forbidding her to see him. You're a wonderful father. Are these pastries? I don't remember. C'mon, a snack for Simone. - Simone, want some tea? - I'll have a chamomile. Hi. We did some shopping, you must be tied up with moving. - Thanks, there's a lot to do. - But it's a new house. What happened there? - We removed the air conditioners. - They're destructive to the environment. Cute, who is she? - Greta Thunberg, do you know her? - No. - Did you throw them out? - No, sold. We bought Alex's scooter, her deliveries will take less time. Come here, I'll show you. Here it is. - A scooter in the house? - To charge it, it's electric. But... it's the baby's room. Come on, apologizing is easier than you think. Good grief! The Confines of the Body - Not for me. - They're for me. I'll look for them. Here we are. Come here. I have to say something to you both. I was wrong. I apologize. I don't want to interfere in your relationship. I'm glad my daughter goes out with you, Poggi. Thank you, thank you! The air's cleared. Excuse me, I have to speak. Sweetheart! Thank you. You were very good! I wanted to show that a woman's body holds all things. Landscapes, nightmares, cosmic space, inner life. In these years, I've been all over... That's Sara. Of course, you didn't recognize her? The last time I saw her naked, she was 7 years old. That's an exaggeration. I present my muse, Sara. We haven't said a word till now because it wasn't sure, but the exhibit is going to America, Sara and I leave in a few days. Sergio, don't. One... two... Fuck it all! No, we still have 22 payments! You were the brain, huh? A picture with Brad Pitt! It's not my fault, I asked a colleague from the Crime Lab to do it, I said it was a joke and he did something witty. - You don't know Brad Pitt? - He's a young actor. - He's not young. - The new generation. I never see movies, and you should talk, you gave Blondie 3 thousand euros. Now he's taking my daughter to London and will spend it on drugs. - You blame me? - No, you're both to blame. Now Sara's going to America to show off her boobs and ass. Why blame me? I wanted war, but you shit in your pants, cowards. The law here, the law there... These things take balls and you two don't have any. Where's he going? - Fuck the law. - Fuck the law, never! - War it is! - It's for their own good. - What the hell are you doing? - Brings good luck. - Please, come in. - Beautiful here. Hi. - There are two of you? - We have an assignment for you. You should seduce a person. You should screw a guy and film it in secret. Don't be crass ! Put a micro HD camera on your bag. - Black on black, it won't show. - Are you peeping Toms? No, it's just blackmail. - I'm leaving. - Just a moment! I'll tell you the truth, don't be frightened. His daughter's with a piece of trash, he wants to break them up. What's this to you? I'm his brother-in-law, we're family men, decent folks. - All my clients are. - Listen... My daughter's 20 and is with a man my age. - I want fifteen hundred euros. - No fucking way! Sorry, but it's out of my pocket. Now who's this? The other brother-in-law. He wanted to stay out of view, he's a lawyer. A man in the public eye. You're very beautiful, no doubt, but fifteen hundred euros seems excessive. Giada is number 2 in the Escort Book. - Meaning? - 5 stars, the queen of anality. Queen... My first free day is the 21st. - 1,500 euros! - You're in the deepest shit. If you don't help me, I won't help you. Remember you're a piece of shit. I'm okay with the 21st. Fifteen hundred... - You sure defend some nasty people. - Take your nose out of my business. Take those feet off! I'm thinking. Valentina wants to get married. She has to realize this girl wants to hang her hat. I have an idea, how often do we hear of boatie caregivers stealing from the elderly? We'll organize, in your house, the theft by a boatie who steals from that old man. But done well! It's theft! I'll bring my pneumatic hammer, we pull the safe out, carry it off and open it calmly. - I'm a cop! - It's an emergency situation. It's a good idea, we need a witness. Hi. - Is Romeo here? - Who's Romeo? - Crusher. - Yeah, back there. - This way? - Yeah. Antonio? Where is he? I don't like this place. - Why talk so softly? - Don't yell. - I'll yell. - Look who's here! The lawyer who saved me tons of times! Let me hug you, after all these years! - How are you? - Fine. - Crusher! - You know one another? - Certainly. - He arrested me the first time. - You let him go. - He was innocent. - This guy fences everything! - There was no proof. - The investigation was sloppy. - I made that investigation! You lawyers cling to technicalities. We lock them up and you let them go. - He doesn't get it. - Want to arrest me? - If it were up to me. - All in prescription! It went in prescription 30 years ago, the present is yet to be seen. I'm as clean as underwear in a drawer. - Depends whose they are. - Can I offer a beer? - No, I don't drink. - Then some juice. So, I should tell the police this Alexia wanted to sell me stolen goods. Exactly. It'll make you look good, you're clean now. Clean, yeah, but not a rat. No, of course, I was looking... - Is this your daughter? - Yes. May I? Holy Virgin Mary! - Just one? - Yes. - So cute when she cries. - She's not crying. You, with hair. - Nice hair, too. - What's her name? Silvia. What a poetic name! - Does she study? - She studies. She's an object of study. I was imagining something, let's say she meets a boy. In theory. - She loves him, marries, you're happy. - Maybe the boy's not. You buy a house, take out a mortgage. One day, from far away, a boatie comes and makes her lesbian, she marries her and they live off your money. There's just one person who can save you. The one who saved your butt 30 years ago because you're guilty. - It's up to you. - Poor Silvia! - I still have to pay 22 payments! - It's all smashed up! It's new! Where are you going? What do you know? I'll go. Quiet! - What are you doing? - We're opening. - I have the key! - It's a theft, we gotta break and enter. He's even a lawyer! This one's no good. Go easy. At a certain hour, our wives leave the theater. Don't stress me, I'm a cop not a thief. - It won't open. - Let's use the small back window. We'll break the small pane and get in. What was that? What the shit did you do? - Are you an idiot? - It's more believable. This is a real breaking and entering. Look at the mess you made. - Where's the safe? - There, in the bookshelf. - Behind the picture. - He's out of his mind. - Now what do I tell my wife? - Are you a moron? We're the thieves! Who ever saw a delicate theft? - I'm calling the police. - I'm the police. And this? - Jewelry, yes, cash, no. - Why's this in there? For thieves, if they don't find anything they get mad, he said so. - Right, we'll keep it for petty cash. - I'll take it. It's stolen goods, you can't, it's risky. Fine, now who shits on the rug? I think it was gypsies. How did they cut the alarm? Must be someone who knew the house, knew where to look. Isabella, my colleagues will do all they can to find the three thieves who... - How do you know there were three? - I mean, there are always two, three... Thank you for coming at this hour. No problem, I'd barely gone to bed. I don't want to sleep here anymore. Darling, please. I have something to tell you. Before the theater, I found something in Marta's knapsack. - Why was this in your knapsack? - It's not mine, I don't do joints. - Give me a blood test. - Then, whose is it? - Blondie's? - Don't call him that! - He calls himself that. - But you say it with contempt. How should I say it? Let me talk! If they catch you with this, you'll end up in group therapy for junkies! Okay, it's Simone's, but he's already been to therapy. - If they catch him, it's a mess. - That's no reason for you to keep it! Do you think he loves you? This is love? - What do you know about love? - I know very well. - Go screw! - Come here... - Did you hear how she spoke to me? - She's a teenager. Calm down, sit here. I'm losing her. She couldn't keep calling you "daddykins" forever, and bringing you coffee in bed. She throwing us off the pedestal, it's normal. What do I care if she doesn't call me daddykins! It's the drugs. They'll convict her, she'll have a record. You going overboard. Marta doesn't do drugs, she feels guilty, she just wants to help her boyfriend who's terribly down, due to the loss of his grandfather. We all lost our grandfathers! Do you really think that idiot does drugs because he lost his grandfather? Darling, do you trust me? Please talk with Simone, you're wrong about him. Or, listen to his lyrics. I'm going to Marta. Tell her... The camera's already filming. Just keep it in front of you. Don't worry a bit! No, sorry. Cover here. - Sorry! - What a big teddy bear! I'm counting on you. - What are you doing here? - We have to go. - We have to get the marijuana. - Huh? I'm sick of thinking only of your daughters. We have to frame Blondie. The Narcotics Squad gave me the name of a pusher they're going to arrest. But if we go to the pusher, we'll be arrested too. Let's talk it over. - Bags? - Gillnet sends us. - Gillnet? - What do you need? - Cocaine. - Don't overdue it! Don't talk because for your daughter... Cocaine! Hi there. What are they doing? Don't touch a thing. Guy, where's the stuff from? What the fuck do you care? I care, is it Bolivian, Mexican? - Mexican's not as plentiful. - You're in the know. He's a major consumer, in fact he's become a dimwit. - He's been using for years! - How much? - A half a pound. - It's not baloney. - That's 15 thousand euros. - He usually pays... - Yes, always. - I don't keep it here. - Where do we go? - Mind your business! All these questions! Are you a cop? Me? Are you kidding? - How much do we get? 2 grams. - No, 10. Let's make it 5. - How much is it? - 100 per gram. The going-rate. - You're sure it's good stuff? - It's a tip from Narcotics. - Knock it off. - Let me by. It's good. We weren't doing... Don't ruin this, stay calm. Where are you going? Can I try it? The last time we had to go back, it was a mess. Easy does it! What's it like? How do you feel? - He feels sick. - He took too much. Good for you, it'll kill you. He took it all, I wanted some. Little Sergio stuffed his face. - Here, you glutton. - How much is it? - 600. - You said 500. Santa Claus sucked up 100. Out with the money. - Before you die. - Spit. 600. - I'll walk you to the ambulance. - No joking. Straight out, when you see the flashing light... Hi, what's your name? - Giada. - Aspiring model? Yes. I'm ready to have you photograph me. Good, strip. Here I am. I'm watching! - Been doing this work for long? - You could teach me. - Stand here. - I thought you'd take nude shots. - I can take this off too. - No need. Then? Two hours of photos where he says I could be a model. He might call me. You didn't do a thing? Return my money, you didn't try hard enough! - Watch it all. - I don't want photos in a ski suit! Then I did this and also this... But he wasn't interested. Where are you going? My laptop! - Who is it? - Police. Good afternoon. - We're looking for Alexia De Souza. - That's me. Hello. - Come with us to headquarters. - Can I know why? - Are you a relative? - I'm her lawyer. Then you can come with us. - May we get our bags? - Certainly. What's going on? I never want to see you again! Vale, sweetheart! The Brothers-in-Law Antonio: come to Marta and Blondie's high school, one hour This is the classroom, be the lookouts. Make it fast. No, girls' bathroom! Got any mascara? Luca kissed me!! I don't give a shit!! Luca give it all to me Marco queer What did she do in the end? She slept with him. You're using make-up? The principal forbids it. You have a game to win, not a fashion show. Sorry. - Toss that cocaine. - Are you nuts? Think you're clever? Come out! Are you using make-up? Do you want to get in trouble just to make your daughter suffer? - It's for her own good. - You have no idea how it feels. I experienced it, you're still in time. Do you listen when you talk? His problem's solved so now he'll cut out. - Tell him something? - What? - I watched the video 20 times... - I'm waiting out here! If you don't jump on pussy like that either you're a fag or... in love. And Poggi's not a fag. If you come out in mascara, you're off to the principal! He's right. You agree with him? First time in history. You're both traitors. You're boys! If you fight, I'll call your parents. The parents are already here, excuse me. Antonio, are you really angry? Of course, I moved heaven and earth for you. Know what I asked the police chief. - No way! - The police chief respects me. Because I work well. Who the fuck do you think you are? Your arrogance has busted my balls, fuck off, you fuck off too. Fuck off! Assholes! Fuck off. - What did he say? - Fuck off. - One day he'll thank us. - One day you'll thank us! Asshole. Hello. You're still here? I said to stay away from my daughter. - It'll end up bad. - Is this a joke? You were supposed to take the 3 thousand euros and disappear. So, you're the madman. - What are you doing? - He's a clown, it was just a push! - Get out of this house. - Hear that? Antonio, I mean you, out! - I don't understand. - Get out, right now! You're disgusting, get out. Get out. You've started smoking? I did some shopping. I don't want you to do my shopping. I feel awkward staying in your house. You can stay all you want. Okay? Did you talk to Valentina? Yes. She doesn't want to see you anymore. I got lentils, for protein. I didn't steal from your house. Why won't anyone believe me? I'll leave it here. - You're in love with Sara? - Yes, I love her, and so? Let me in, I have to talk to you. Let me in! Relax, I won't touch you. - This is where you work. - Yes. You're good. Will you take care of my daughter? It's easy now, but in 5 years? In 10, when she'll be 33 and you, 61? - 61, are you sure? - Yeah. Now it's all great, but then arthritis comes, rheumatism, heart. - Sergio! - Poggi! Then your knees will give way, your hips, in the end your prostrate will fuck off. And then, will you still take care of my daughter? Sara is autonomous, she doesn't need me to take care of her. Not true, everyone has needs. I want my daughter to be happy. Swear you'll take care of her. Sergio, I don't know. Already thinking of taking up with another little girl? No! No! I swear. I'll be pleased to have you for dinner every Sunday. I'll take you to weddings, funerals, you'll come... for Christmas, to our cousins in Padua. At Easter I'll take you to my Aunt Clelia's in Saccile. Know where that is? No. - Come here. - No. Welcome to the family. Welcome. - Anyone here? - Here I am. - A few clothes fell. - Need any help? Here I am, what is it? - I'm Marta's father. - Pleased to meet you, Giovanna. I'm happy to meet you, you have a splendid daughter. How can I help you? I'm a police officer. Something very serious has happened. In your son's knapsack, we found... this. It's cocaine. I can cover things up, and I run a risk, but you have to swear that your son will never see my daughter again. Hi. Darling... For me? Why? - Why? - You'll be proud of me. I will? What is it? What's the matter? Luigi left me, he's going to America alone, he says he's too old for me, his prostrate won't hold up. - It can't be. - Stop it! - You terrorized him. - What did you do? I just said I was happy to welcome him to the family. Sure, you know him! Even Easter with Aunt Clelia! You're an asshole! Get out. - Get out, Sergio get out! - I swear... I'll break this over your head. I got it all wrong. It's not easy for a woman alone. My husband died when Simone was 7. I'm to blame, I wanted to give him everything, but he lacked what he needed most, his mother. I'm sorry for Marta. And for you. Simone was growing fond of you. Huh? I've seen it a thousand times. Dad? - Why was this in your knapsack? - I swear, it's not mine. Why are you selling this stuff? No music from now on. You'll stop music and see a psychologist, if I have to sell my underwear! Stop, it's flour! - It's flour. - Why was flour in my son's knapsack? - I put it there. - Why? Because this jerk doesn't want me to be with Marta. - I'm not hurt. - You jerk, you'd beat up my father? C'mon, honey! - Open up? - I called you a hundred times. - What's going on? - Come in. Well? Alexia's accuser fences half the stolen goods in Rome, he had 4 million worth. Why does a guy like this report someone for trying to sell him 3 necklaces? Crusher! - Someone wants to frame Alexia. - Who do you think? - Carlo? - No, he's too stupid. I know, it's my father. He wants me to come back, get married and lock me in the house. - Wasn't he living in a shack? - No, he's one of those with a villa. He won't accept that his daughter is gay... Your father can't understand. - What's wrong Dad? - Me? It's nothing, call an ambulance. Mrs. De Rosa? Your husband had the beginning of a heart attack. Don't worry, he's out of danger. It was just a great scare. You can rest now. - Can I see him? - That's not possible, in the morning. Thank you. Let's go home. Let's go. - Where are you going? - Home. I really don't think so. Home! Good grief, this beep, beep... Are you awake? - Yes. - I haven't slept a wink. Go get breakfast so I can sleep 10 minutes. I have something to confess. I should have listened to you both, I shouldn't have kept at it. I was wrong, I'm a jerk. Then I'm a bigger jerk than you, I launched the idea. No, I am, I insisted for the hard line. Let's not argue, the three of us are jerks. Why did they arrest Crusher now? I sent them, told you he wasn't clean. You're right, you're a jerk. He fenced all kinds of stolen goods. Hello? What? Get here fast. - What's the matter? - A very serious thing. There's an expulsion provision for Alexia. They're taking her to the airport. What? There's no money to repatriate the boaties! Even kids know that. What the fuck happened? Remember I asked the police chief a favor? That's it, I did it for him. - It was you? - Yes. - I'm leaving. - For where? To do what's best for my daughter. I suggest you do the same. Ready? Let's try it. Go with the base. Hello, a beer. Ready? My mother says it's for my own good I learn from pain for my own good but my shoulders are strong I am what I am, not what you expect If I cry at home no one can see me Tell me what you'd do Put yourself in my shoes but I know they'd be tight Time heals all wounds is crap I walk a street that's always steep People love you only when you're at the top A wrench in my works snakes in my life My mother says it's for my own good I learn from pain for my own good But I have strong shoulders for your own good I lack a place to belong to Nothing strikes or represents me Eyes on me, anxiety and solitude Outside it's hailing and I feel fragile If that were not enough, I've lost my grandpa He protected me from the evils of the world I try to look ahead but pain is the undertone At his funeral, no tears out of pride I didn't cry for my own good For my own good I never cry for my own good For my own good I lost my father, I spent a summer praying to a God who wasn't there I changed homes a thousand times I never lived a fairy-tale I left broken dreams in the moving I feel blurry in pictures I fight my hate and it beats me, but on the podium I always dreamed big for me it was no game It's time for the big leap hoping it's not a void My mother says it's for my own good... - Come on, the flight's leaving. - What flight? The one for New York with Luigi. - Luigi doesn't want me. - What are you saying? He's crazy about you, he falls apart when he sees you. - Come on, let's go! - Okay. - My suitcase. - I packed for you. You have to leave here! Stay calm and no one will get hurt. What's going on? We're just making music. I'm a colleague! To the airport. Luigi! - Hurry, he's crazy. - It's all okay! What's he doing? If he catches us, he'll kill us both. - Why won't he stop? - You always beat him up! That's not true! - C'mon, he's getting closer. - He's not too smart, is he? Dad, drop it! Stop! What are you doing? It's an IV, not a Kalashnikov. Did you fight again? It was his colleagues. Actually, he helped me. He and I are different in all ways, but we have one thing in common. We both want you to be happy. Poggi? - Open up. - No! I don't want to hit you, I just want to tell you you can cure your prostrate, I won't take you to Aunt Clelia's, although her Easter lamb is wicked good. If you don't want to go, I won't take you, but you can't run off, talk to one another. Look, I paid 800 euros for it, it's 65% of my salary. If Sara won't go, I'll come with you to New York myself. I promise. One, two... We're her lawyers, you have to release her. It's late, there's an enforceable order. I love you. She's innocent, please. I did the theft. I hid the evidence, I pressured false witness. It was me, I did it. I have the proof, the jewels are in my office safe. I have them. Forgive me, sweetheart. - I love you. - Me too, so much. Take that apron off, you're not a waitress, you're a model. Go! Go, or you'll miss your flight! - Thank you. - Go! - Well? - They've gone. Are you proud of me? Yes. Coming back here? Don't use that tone of voice, you set my pulse racing. Come back, darling! You're giving me visions. I'm having hallucinations. I seem to see Arturo in a squad car. With his IV out the window! Should I come for you? Stay there, wild child, I'll come to you. Today is the most beautiful day of my life. It took some time for me to accept this union, but now I'm happy. I'm happy to be here. Also because if I weren't, the smiles on Valentina and Alexia wouldn't be there, I can't see them. I can't see them but I can imagine them, that's my prize. What can I say? I wish you tons of happiness. Tons of happiness. I love you both. Arturo we miss you! Thank you! A toast to Arturo. Yes, to Dad! - To Arturo. - Excuse me. If two women marry, who throws the bouquet? - You're an idiot! - It's tradition. Let's get into position. Ready? One...
