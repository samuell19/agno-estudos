(gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) - There. (car engines revving) Lemonade. Lemonade. Get your ice-cold lemonade here. - What! Mabel Lamston. - Edith. - Well of all people, I never expected. - What, I'm surprised. - What are you doing here? - Now don't laugh, I'm selling lemonade. I've got this little stand and I'm selling lemonade. (both laughing) Oh, you don't say. - Yes, I'll go on down the road. - You'll do nothing of the sort. There's plenty of business both of us. - You sure you don't mind? - I'll be glad for the company. (Edith laughing) - I can't get over meeting you like this. - I always said, it's a small world. - Well it certainly is here. (car engines revving) Well, I'm out of breath. There. - All set? - Yes. I am open for business. (both laughing) Never seen so many cars. - It's a holiday weekend. Happy Decoration Day. - We get to call it Memorial Day. Happy Memorial Day. - Now, what I do is this, I shout lemonade every so often. Like this. Lemonade. - I don't know if I've got the nerve. - Well you'll never make a sale if you don't try Edith. - Lemonade. - Very good. - Lemonade. - Wonderful. - Lemonade. - Challenge well out. - I used to sing you know, - Really? - Years ago I was with a singing group. You probably heard of us the Cincinnati songbirds. - I'm trying to think. - Well, we used to sing in hotel lobbies a lot. That's how I met Herbert. In the lobby of the Sequani hotel, he was sitting and I was singing. And one thing led to another. - Oh yeah. - I miss my singing. - I'm over sorry I didn't have a career. - Well, maybe now you have. - Oh, this, this is just a diversion. I don't expect it to lead anywhere, do you? - Oh gracious no, it was just an excuse to get out of the house. - I know how you feel. - Now that the children are gone. Things are too quiet around there for me. I like things during all these cars whizzing by. - I was sorry to hear about the children Edith. - Oh, don't let that bother you. Have you sold anything? - Oh, I just got here myself. - If I could just sell one glass, I'd feel I'd done something. I had the most awful shock the other day. - What in the world happened? - I came across Elizabeth Arden's obituary in an old newspaper. Did you ever happened to read it? - I don't think... - When I read what she'd accomplished, I just went limp in the knees. There she was all over life. Inventing things, discovering things. Oh, she made Madame Curie looked like a slouch. All that money. Millions of dollars. She even had race horses. - No, I don't think I'd like to keep race horses. When I think what I've done. I wonder why I was put on this earth. Do you ever feel like that? - It's all too clear to me Edith. - What is? - We're mothers. That's what we are here for. And I for one, I'm exhausted. Bringing them up, seeing them through college, making good marriages. And with my brood, it was especially difficult. Marilyn, cross-eyed Randolph, a cripple. I had to do double duty. Anyway, I did it. That was that. - I don't mean to pry, but what are you doing out here in the middle of the highway selling lemonade? - I really don't know. I get up this morning and I looked at Raymond reading his newspaper over the breakfast coffee. Well anyway, I said, wouldn't it be fun to go out on the highway and set up a lemonade stand. I don't mind admitting I feel pretty peculiar. President of the league of women voters. - Well I'm grand matron of the order of the Eastern star. - Oh, lemonade. (both laughing) - Where do you suppose all these people are going? - Oh, just driving around I guess. I used to enjoy that, especially on Sundays. I don't so much anymore too many cars on the road. - I suppose I should be at the cemetery doing something to the children's graves. - I feel so guilty. I should be putting peonies on Raymond's mother. We do that every year you know. We put peonies on Raymond's mother. - Herbert's people are all in Sandusky. So I just send his sister to check every year and she decorates them. Oh, she has such poor taste. She buys plastic wreaths. I certainly hope when my time comes, nobody puts a plastic wreath on me. - You see plastic everywhere these days Edith. - I just pray Herbert's sister goes first. - Did you see the way that the car slowed down. - I wasn't looking. - I thought we'd made our first sale. (Mabel coughs) - I do know how cars and a paved highway can stear up so much dust. - Oh it's terrible. I think we ought to sample the product. - We mustn't drink up all the profits Edith. - Just one little cup. I want you to try mine. - I'd love to. and you must have some of mine. I'm afraid it's tepid. - Oh, it's impossible to keep it cold. Mine was icy when I left the house, but now I'm sure the... Here. - Thank you - Thank you dear. - Oh, Mabel! - Is it all right? - It's perfect. Oh, it certainly hits the spot. - It can't be any better than yours. What did you put in it? Lemon chagrin water? - You must put something in it it's got a wonderful flavor. - Really? - Like gin. (Mabel hiccups) - Surprised? what does it taste like? Vodka? I don't know that I've ever tasted vodka. - Well now you have. (both laugh) - You're wicked. - Edith there are times when you're just have to break laws. - But not out here on the highway. - I'm so sick of being me. I don't know what to do. - I had the funniest dream the other night. I dreamed I was Shirley Temple. There I was in one of those old musicals she used to make dancing away with those sausage curls on my head. And Herbert was my mother. (both laughing) Isn't that funny? He was wearing a big flowered hat and smoking a cigar. Every now and then he was saying, "we're investing her money." (both laughing) - I hardly ever dream. - Oh, I dream all the time. Just before the children died. I had a dream about a bonfire. Now that's spooky considering... - Oh I don't think that means anything. Oh! Did you see that? - No. - A Hawaiian license plate. My they're a long way from home. - I can't get used to that being a state. They'll always be foreigners to me. What they're doing here. - Just passing through I suppose. - They must've shipped that car over in a boat. - That cost a pretty penny. - Oh lots of people have got it. I don't know where the money comes from these days Edith. It's always other people. - Edith, with all the money Herbert's made. - Oh, he's a terrible TaeKwonDo Even the children's caskets. Were you at the funeral? - Oh, that was during the tournament at the bridge club. I was so sorry Edith. - It doesn't matter. Anyway, we had the lowest price caskets we could get. Carolyn's almost fell apart on the way to the cemetery, I didn't say anything, but I was terribly annoyed with Herbert. - He always seems so generous, the wing of the hospital and all. - That's just for show. When it comes to funeral time, he doesn't care what he sticks in the ground. - Really, he's so distinguished. - Do you think so? so many people say that, but I don't see it. All I know is when I first met Herbert Northrup in the Sequani hotel, he was nothing but a bum - Herbert? - And sex maniac. - What? - I was so shocked. We hadn't been married 10 minutes before I hardly got my veil off. Come to think of it, I didn't even get my veil off from then on, it was morning, noon and night. He'd come home for lunch and never taste his sandwich. - Herbert? - Where do you think we got that big family? Because we like children? - I've never thought about it one way or the other. - I used to say to him, I look up and say, Herbert, you know what I am? I'm passions play thing. - What does he say to that? - He was always too busy to talk. - Can't imagine. - Oh well, appearances are deceiving. What about you? - Me? - You and Raymond. You haven't told me a thing. - Oh Edith we've never been this sort of friends to exchange confidences. - You and Raymond? - You and me. - There's no time like the present. - Oh, I don't know if I should. Oh well. - It's a holiday. - Don't drop yourself. Thank you. May I? - Oh yes, yes. It's so refreshing. - There's nothing like a glass of lemonade in the warm day. Bottoms up. - Now, tell me about you and that sweet Raymond. - Oh, I don't think that's the word you'd apply to Raymond. - I think he's sweet. Tell me all about it. - I wouldn't know where to begin. - Start with the wedding night. - Oh Edith, that was so long ago. I'm not sure I can remember. We were at The Grand Canyon and I do recall thinking The Grand Canyon was more impressive than Raymond, especially at Twilight. - I wonder if that's such a good idea. Newlyweds going to places like that, being surrounded by all that natural splendor, it makes everything else look so piddling. - Where did you and Herbert honeymoon? - Niagara falls. - Oh! - Of course we didn't get around to seeing the falls, but Herbert said it didn't matter. Just a lot of water going over a cliff. - Well, The Grand Canyon is just a hole in the ground. Isn't it? (both laughing) I mean, when I think back, I get this vague feeling of disappointment. - I know exactly how you feel. - I guess I expected more. I was so uninformed. Nowadays the young people seem so much more sophisticated than we were. - Frankly I don't see what men see in it. - No. Only, with the right person, there might be a possibility of... - Well, we'll never know. - Lemonade. - Lemonade. - All those cars. Oh, do you know who I saw in the late movie the other night? Rudolph Valentino. - So did I. - Wasn't he marvelous? The way he swept that woman up and carried her off on his stallion. - He could put his shoes under my bed anytime. - Oh, mine too. - Of course. You wouldn't want to settle down in Peoria with him, but in a tent in the desert, he was certainly everything you could ask for. - I didn't care if he was Italian. - Did Herbert ever sweep you up like that? - Oh, Herbert was more of a lunger than a sweeper. What about Raymond? - Raymond? Well, Raymond wasn't really like Valentino. He was more like that other fellow Franklin Pangborn. - Now that's very strange. Raymond Lamston always struck me as being a real dark horse. - What do you mean? - Well, sensual. - My Raymond? - Sort of smoldering underneath. (laughing) - This lemonade is strong stuff. - Have a little more. - Will you join me? - I might have one. (both laughing) - That's such a good idea. - I haven't has so much fun in years. - Then you settled down here? - Where was that? - After The Grand Canyon. - Oh, it's where Raymond got a job. Oh, that was long before he bought his own business. Raymond's always lived here. I've never told anyone, not even Raymond, but I always wanted to live in New York city. Isn't that silly. - We go there every year, see the sites. - Raymond likes to stay at home. We just stick in the mud. Well, after that, the children came up, there was nothing. Raymond said I'd dropped children like a Chinese peasant. He said, all I needed was a cool day. And a rice Patty. I have no patience with these women to make such a fuss about having babies. - Hm. I suffered. - You did? - I suffered the tortures of the damned with Edgar. First, he wanted to come out too soon. Then he didn't wanna come out at all. Then he got halfway out and decided to go back in. Oh, believe me Mabel. If the men had the babies, this would be a different world. I can just imagine Herbert in labor, i just see him screaming and flailing his arms. - Oh Raymond, he's just gonna hang there. - I'd love to see Herbert with triplets, mother of three. (both laughing) - I needed that more to be pitied than censured. - I'm not so sure of that. - I'm just glad it's all over. I really am Edith. I'm glad I've got my own room. I'm glad I don't have to have any more babies. And I'm glad I don't have to bring them up. That's all comfortably behind me. From now on, I can just settle down to a nice gentle, painless decay. - Then what are you doing out here on the highway selling lemonade? - I might ask you the same question. I'll be honest. Aren't you just as glad it's all over. - Mabel I haven't told a soul this yet, but I want you to know. - What? - I'm getting married. - You're what? - I'm getting married. - Edith, you've been married for 25 years. - I'm leaving Herbert and marrying somebody else. - You can't be serious. - I am. - That's unthinkable. You and Herbert apart? I can't... - I've fallen deeply and desperately in love. This is the real thing at last Mabel. It's the most beautiful thing that's ever come into my life. And I don't intend to lose it. - I can't believe it. - You probably think it's too late for me, but you're wrong. We're perfect together. He's a little bit older than I am, but it's all to the good. Mabel we have such moments of understanding. We read aloud together. We're halfway through The Agony and The Ecstasy. - Who is he? - He's a school teacher, a widower. He isn't much to look at, a little rough, a little homely, but very sensitive underneath. And he worships the ground I walk on. - Where does he teach? - What? - Where does he teach? - Where? - Where? - Well, he teaches at the Sequani Junior High School out at the other end of town. He teaches music, singing. - I've never heard of it. - Well, it's at the other end of town. - A little more lemonade dear? - No thank you. - What about Herbert? - Herbert doesn't need me. - Surely after 25 years Edith... - Herbert Northrup has never once raised his hand to me. He's never cared enough to even want to. My friend at the Sequani Junior High School, once threw a copy of Anthony adverse at me. I had to have three stitches. (Mabel clears her throat) - Edith, there is no Sequani Junior High School. - What are you saying? - I said, there is no Sequani Junior High School. - Why you turn cold? - I'm merely stating facts. - I don't want your facts. You talk like some silly man. I know there isn't any Sequani Junior High School for all I know, there isn't any Sequani hotel either. And I didn't sing and Herbert wasn't sitting there and I suppose I'm not a woman who's watched her children go up in flames. - I really don't know Edith. - But if it didn't happen, why do I remember it so clearly? Why can I still smell the smoke? - Edith, lots of things that occupy minds never happened and never will. So there's no sense in worrying about it. Now I do admire you for decorating the children's graves, even as they are not dead, they will be one day. And you'll be that much further ahead. As for this school teacher that you've invented. - I don't care to discuss that. I might also mention that Maryland isn't cross-eyed and Randolph isn't a cripple either. - But I did try. I tried everything to get Madeline's eyes to cross. I had her doing eye exercises in reverse, reading small print and a dim light, everything. And as for Randolph, I never stopped putting obstacles in his way. A box here, a bucket there. It was just too nimble for me. They were wonderful children. It was the least I could do for them. - Do you remember Miss Gundlach. - Raymond's secretary, of course a lovely woman. - They copulated time and time again, over and over. - That's no true. - It was common knowledge. He kept a room above the Sequani casino at the other end of town. And they went there at lunchtime every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. - That's impossible. Raymond had no interest and had no need. - Sometimes they went on Tuesdays and Thursdays too. - Why should he do that? I was waiting. I was willing. I always did the best I could. - Well, there's no need to worry about it. So many of the things that occupy our mind never happened and never will. - You are a gossip Edith. I must ask you to leave. Go on. Peddle your lemonade somewhere else. - This is a public highway. I have just as much right here as you have. - Please go. - Never. - Very well. I shall see to it that you do no business whatsoever. - Nobody, but nobody under sales, Edith Northrup. - I never liked you very much Edith. - Feeling is mutual. - I always found you uninspired, tawdry, common. - You're pompous, overbearing, stupid. - Shallow. - For your information, I am a woman of unplumbed depths. All right I'll admit it's too late, but I'm still unplumbed... - You make yourself sound like a bathroom fixture. - You needn't sound so smug, you're in the same boat. I'll tell you one thing, If I had been Mrs. Raymond Lamston things would have been different. - I suppose that would have made me Mrs. Herbert Northrup. - Well, I wouldn't be surprised. - Well, I'm not sure I care for that. - Yes you would. Anyway, you don't know what you'd care for. Heaven knows I don't. Half the time I find I don't care for what I thought I cared for at all. It would have been nice, I admit, if I dropped a lit cigarette on the living room carpet and watch the children go up in flames a lovely moment no doubt. But afterward they really would have been dead and I'd have missed them. They've kept me going for a long time. You know what I think our trouble is. - Whose? - Ours, everybody's. - I'm not sure I want to hear. - I think our trouble is that way deep down we're filled with... - If this is going to be unpleasant... - It's love Mabel. I think way deep down we're filled with love. I mean way deep down so that sometimes you can't even see it. You don't even know it's there and that poses problems. Here we are on this planet earth. (Mabel sobbing) Mabel. Oh, Mabel. What is it, dear? - I'm sorry, I've been such a fool. - Now you just go ahead and have a good cry. Better now? - I don't know what came over me out here on the highway too. - What do you care What people think? All right? - Yes, I'm really, I'm sorry. This isn't like me at all. It was just despair that made me do it. All these years and I've never found the answer. At first I thought it would be physical contact and it wasn't. And human relationships weren't to be counted on the change for the wind and religion turned out to be a bit of a fake or manmade. I don't know. Sometimes I think the best we can do is just be kind to each other. And keep pets. - Is that all you've been worried about? - Isn't that enough? - Well, I'll tell you what to do. You simply go home, fuss over Raymond a little bit, rustle up something good for dinner, watch a little television and go to bed. - I won't be tired. - Then read for a while in bed, put on some soft music on the radio and read in bed. How can life get any better than that? Well, I don't think I'm gonna sell a thing. I might as well go home. Are you coming? - No, not just yet. - I'll leave my things here. Who knows? You may sell all of yours and mine too. Goodbye my dear. - Oh, thank you Edith. - It's been awfully pleasant. - You must come by for dinner some evening. Very soon. - We'd love to. And you folks be sure to stop by whenever you're in the neighborhood. Raymond is always saying we must have Edith and Herbert to dinner. - Mabel, I wish you'd been to the funeral. It was a beautiful service if I do say so, we did very well by the children. - Lemonade. (car engine revving) Lemonade. Get your lukewarm lemonade here. (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music)
