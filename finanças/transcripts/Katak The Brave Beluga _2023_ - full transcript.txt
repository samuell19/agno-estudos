First one to the tower wins. I'm going to win. I'm the fastest. Ha-ha, we'll see about that! Woo-hoo! The last one there is a crusty old snail. That leaves a slimy old trail! Swim, Lulu! Don't just let the current push you! Hey, you just watch where you're going. Hey, wait for me! You just have to swim faster! [giggles] Just you wait! I'm going to catch you! Aw! Hey, that's not fair! Ugh! Huh? Just give up. You don't stand a chance. Oh, yeah? You think so? Boo! Ah! You think you're funny, huh? Hey! Dream on, dude. I've already got this. I did it! Oh. Yeah! Woo, woo! All right! Yeah! Hey, minnow. Huh? Isn't it time for your num num? Mama. Mama. What a twit. Hey, leave him alone, you sore loser. Want to swim around? I saw some herrings. I'm not hungry. I just saw Estelle. She's as big as a blue whale. If she's that big, she must be about to give birth any day now. Aw, don't worry. We'll know when she is about to... oh! Hey! Hey, you could at least say excuse me. Sorry! Not that it's any of my business, but shouldn't he have turned white by now? He appears to be late in developing. Ah, I see. He insulted Katak again. Oh, but what are we going to do about it? Nothing, Marina. So have you chosen a name for the baby yet? Not yet, no. Hey, Katak. You're, uh, back already? Grandma? Grandma, are you awake? Yes, come here and give me a big hug before you turn white and go off to live with the males. Mm. What? Whenever you let your melon droop like that, I know it means you're upset about something. Hm. What's the matter? I'm the same age as Sim and Albi. Why can't I go with them and live with the males? It feels like I'm going to stay gray for the rest of my life. Come on now. You'll see. When Estelle's baby is born in a few weeks, he'll become the little gray one, and he'll make us all go gaga. Even my mom? Your mom will find that you've grown so quickly and that you're much older. I sure hope so. Mm. Mm. Mother, Estelle's baby just moved. Come and see. That means he'll be quite feisty. Here, I can feel it. He's kicking me with his tail. Feel here, Grandma. Aw. 2,080, 2,081, 2,082, 2,083, 2,084, 2,085, 2,086, 2,087, 2,088, 2,089, 2,090, 2,091, 2,092, 2,093... Not that it's any of my business, but one day, he's going to suffocate. Or lose consciousness. 2,099, 2,100, 2,101, 2,102... Whoa. It's about time. I was about to pass out myself. 2,104 seconds! Wow! Really? Bravo! Bravo! I could have done better. Hey, cousin. You're king of holding your breath. "King of holding your breath." Albi, we're going to the deep. Woo-hoo! Coming. Ha-ha! Hey. You'll be going with them soon. Hey! A floater's coming. Everyone, follow me. We have to stay in the protected zone. Come on, hurry! Estelle's not here? But I thought she was with you, Naya. Oh, Estelle! Estelle! Quick, we have to go back into the protected zone! Estelle! Estelle! Estelle, come back! Estelle! Estelle! Estelle! Naya! Lulu! I can't see anything! Mama! Mama! Oh! Estelle! Over here! Estelle! Oh! Oh! My ears! Mama! Huh? Over there! I see her! Estelle! I'm going to get her. No, Katak! It's too dangerous. Even we don't go there. But I'm not afraid! Come on, Katak! It's not about being afraid. It's just too dangerous. I'll get her. But I'm going, too! No, Katak! Ah! No! Aw, but Mom! Aw! Eugh? Mama! Aw, crap! Oh! Ah! Hang on! Oh, thank you, Albi. If it wasn't for you, I can't imagine what would have happened. Oh, yes, thank you, Albi. You gave us quite the scare, Estelle. Hey, if you need help, don't give it a second thought. Just give me a shout. Ha-ha. What bravery. You're my hero. That took a lot of courage. I would have saved Estelle, too, you know. I know. You're so much like your grandpa. Have I ever told you the story about your grandfather? Again? Yeah, but that's OK. I love hearing stories about him. Yeah, well, I know this one by heart. Oh, yeah, I've heard that one over 1,000 times. No one knows if any of it is actually true. Yeah. Do you believe any of it? Forget about them, Grandma. I haven't heard it 1,000 times. You can tell me the story again if you like. When I was young, I heard tales of a cruel killer whale who terrified all downriver, Jack Knife. He had a dorsal fin that was shaped like a switchblade. He would kill all the belugas that dared to venture into his territory, just for his own amusement. He was a real killer whale. Yes, but one beluga came out alive in a fight with Jack Knife, Katak. He had traveled south from the great ice floe and wasn't afraid of anything, even the bloodthirsty killer whale. And... and... and... and he discovered his weakness, and that's the reason he survived! Mm-hmm. He discovered that Jack Knife was sensitive to certain high-pitched sounds. He defeated Jack Knife, but he was in rough shape when he got here. I was the one who took care of him. He spent the whole summer here with me, and a beautiful summer it was, the most incredible summer of my life. I remember every moment. Eventually, his wounds healed. You were really in love with him? Mm, yes. And he was in love with me. He wanted me to return with him to the great ice floe. So then why didn't you go? I didn't want to leave my family. He was far away when I realized I was carrying a beautiful baby. He doesn't even know my mom exists? I hoped for so long he'd find out and come back. Poor Estelle. Aw. Why doesn't it ever work? Each time a mother gets pregnant, she loses the baby. I want to have babies, too, someday. Oh, Mother really wanted to see Estelle's baby. It's what was keeping her alive. What? Are you worried she's going to give up? She no longer has a reason to fight her illness. I think she might be leaving us soon. Shh! Lulu, you hear that? Grandma's going to die. I know. But I don't want her to. Me neither. Hmm. Katak! Are you feeling all right, Grandma? I feel very old all of a sudden. Grandma? Grandma, I'm going to go to the great ice floe and bring back your love. But it's a secret. Don't tell anyone, OK? Not even Lulu. That's so sweet, Katak. But it's much too far and much too dangerous. I can do it, Grandma. Promise you'll wait for us. Promise. Mm, mm, mm. Hey! Huh? You minnow. Where are you going? Get out of my way. Hm. Hm. Well, as of right now, there's no denying it. We're on the brink of extinction. And pretty soon, there won't be one beluga left in the river. If only we knew why it was happening to us. It was the noise that stressed out Estelle. That's true. Before, it was a lot quieter. Does that mean we'll have to move if it gets too noisy? But where would we go? Grandma and old Nick are too old to move now. You'll just have to leave me here. Me as well. No, mother. We're the only ones who stay in the river during the winter. Have you seen Katak at all? All the other whales spend the winter down south and come back in... No. The start of summer with their babies. Are you saying we should go with them? But the water's too hot down there. Well, uh, maybe the heat is better for the babies. I'm afraid to travel. We'll run into a lot of floaters. So we'd go for the whole winter? Absolutely! It might just be worth giving it a try. I'm going for sure. Me, too. Me, too. Me, too! All right, then it's settled! We're going south with the other whales at summer's end, and we will save our great pod. Yeah! Hooray! Whoa! Hm, hm, whoa! Woo-hoo! What's the little gray one doing here in these parts? Huh? Not a clue. Huh? Hey! Please! I beg you, spare me. I'm the last cod there is! Don't be afraid, Madame Cod. I won't eat you. Have a good day. Hey, young fella. You sure are in a hurry. Not that it's any of my business, but where are you off to all alone? Ha, you're right. It is none of your business. Huh? Bye! Well, I'll be darned. Well. Hmm. Huh? Whoa. Woo! Woo-hoo! Where in the world could he have gotten to? Oh, oh! This is the first time he stayed out this late. Marina. Well? Well? I couldn't find him. Ah. Woo-hoo! Wow! Hey, Mr. Sturgeon! Come back! That jump you did was so cool. Can you do it again? No. Why are you hiding? I'm not hiding. Well, what's your name? Cyrano. Mine is Katak. Ya-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Ow! Ow. Oh, sorry. This is the first time I've seen a gray beluga without his mother. I don't need a mother. Are you alone, too? I prefer that. I can go where I want, when I want. Yeah, so can I. So where are you going? To the great ice floe. Ooh. It's cold up there. I don't care. Well, good luck. You, too. Hey, do you even know the way there? Not so much. Not so much? No, he didn't spend the night here. Oh. He's nowhere to be found. I'll go look some more! Hmm. Knowing him, he got lost on the way. On the way where? If you know anything, talk! They saw him heading towards the rising sun. He was in a hurry! He refused to tell us where he was going. Uh-uh, and he seemed to be in such a hurry. Mm-hmm. Minnow is on the run! Albi! On the run? From what? I'm going after him. Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no, I can't leave Grandma. Don't worry. I'll bring him back. I'm coming with you. We're going to find him. Albi. Hm? You're coming with us. Oh, why me? That's an order! Oh, that's an order. Hmph. Good luck! Stay safe! Yeah, stay safe! Oh! Hey! What? What a cool-looking beak. Huh? Oh, shh! Not so loud! Wait, don't go. It's the first time I've seen a bird like you. Shh! You got a death wish? Are you totally insane? Or both? Uh, no. Why? Don't say I didn't warn you. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Hmm? Whoa! Hey. Huh? Huh? Look! Hey! Hello. Hmm. Hm? Hello, little one. Mm. Huh? Where do you think you're going? You can't get away from me! Little one, I see you. It's no use trying to escape! Watch out, coming through! Little one. I'm going to get you, little one. Oh, no! I'm coming! Oh, come back here, you! Oh, don't think you can escape me! Big mistake, little one. You're going to have to come up for air sometime. I'm sure you're starting to run out of air. Take your time, but I'm warning you. Waiting makes me even hungrier. Huh? Jack Knife. Mm. Mm, yummy. Mm. Huh? Hey! Hey! Don't be afraid. Huh? I don't like belugas. Well, what I meant was I don't eat them! Huh? Oh, no? Then why are you chasing me? What I really like is seaweed. Before, I used to eat shrimp, but the poor little guys, they didn't deserve that. The best has to be sea lettuce. Have you ever tried sea lettuce? Huh? Leave me alone, all right? I said, leave me alone! Yeah, but looks like you're hurt. You... you... y... y... y... y... you're... you're bleeding! Guh! Ugh. Ugh. Hm. Hm. Hey, you OK? Wake up. What's wrong? Come on, wake up. Huh? Did I pass out? Yeah. And you didn't swim away? No. But I... I got to get going. Why are you all alone? Usually the gray ones are with their moms. I'm not like the others. I might be gray, but I'm older. I'm not like the others either. Yeah, a killer whale who faints at the sight of blood is pretty rare. Especially when she happens to be the daughter of Jack Knife. Hmm? Jack Knife? Wait up! We can be friends. My name's Jack-Lynn. Mine is Katak, but we can never be friends! Katak, like the famous Katak? Yes. No! He's my grandpa. No! Mm-hmm. Uh... well, we've got a big problem. Are you out of your mind? Cyrano? You can't be friends with the daughter of Jack Knife. But that's what I said. Well, well, well, I better follow you to make sure you don't get into trouble. I don't need anyone, all right? It's not what you think. Especially telling me what to do. Oh, no? No. But if you really want to and you're not afraid of the cold. D'oh. Come on. Oh, fine. Did you hear that? What? There, a dorsal fin! There! I see him! There! Huh? Huh? It's... huh... there! Oh, I'm not sticking around here. I think it's him. Who? You know who. It's Jack Knife? Oh, no! D'oh! Uh, guys? Where is everyone? Anyone here? Hello! You want a little bite, sweetie? Ugh. Blegh. No, thank you. Come on, make an effort. You're the one who needs to make an effort! How do you expect me to make friends when all you ever do is eat them? You have blood there. No, there. If all you ever eat is seaweed, you're never going to get strong. Ugh! You don't understand! Yes, I saw him yesterday morning. Thank you, my friend. No problem. See you. So Katak came this way. He's taking the coast. Then how far ahead is he? About a day. We've got to hurry! We've got to hurry. Albi, knock it off with the whining. Let's go. [scoffs] Man, I was dreaming of going down south. Going south? We have to find Katak. And that's all that matters. Aw! Are you going to be able to sleep? Or do you want to take turns keeping watch? There's no need. I'm not afraid of Jack Knife. Shh! I know I can hold my breath longer than him. Ha, you've got a big head. Are you afraid of him? Jack Knife? Nah. I've got extremely rough scales, and killer whales hate that. Calm down, OK? It's just a loon, nothing to be afraid of. No, no, I know. I wasn't afraid. I... I just twitched. That's all. Oh, OK. Hm. Oh, I was right, eh? It's a gray beluga. What do you mean, you were right? I'm the one who said, look, there's a gray beluga, but you didn't hear me because you honk nonstop. Oh, I honk nonstop, do I? Yes! Ho, ho, and you don't honk all the time? Ooh, hello! Help! Sorry, little one. We didn't mean to scare you. Are you OK? Yeah. Are you lost? No. No, no. I'm going to the great ice floe. Ooh, the great ice floe, eh? That's where we were hatched. You'll see, it's beautiful. We go back every year. You mean we used to go back. We don't anymore. The proof is that we're here in the middle of summer. Do you know how to get there? Head 0, 0 due north. Uh... Align yourself with the North Star. Uh, except the North Star isn't exactly due north. Well, no, [murmurs]. You see? It'll be easy to find. Mm-hmm. Thanks a lot. Watch out for the South Side. The what? Don't worry, ladies. I'll watch over him. Good luck! Hey, look at you. You've lost weight. You think so? Did you eat anything today? I have no appetite. Nothing's very tempting. Hello there, Madame Cod. Huh? Did he... did he just say "cod"? Hey, wait up! How do you know that I'm a cod? Well, you have the same barbel as the other one. What other one? The one I met back there. Oh! And I thought we were the last ones in the world. All right, come on. Let's go. And where are we going? To find the other one. So that means that there's three of us? The little gray one was traveling alone. He was going up north. Yeah, he's capable of holding his breath for such a long time. No one's ever seen that before. It's a phenomenon. And I heard that he even foiled Jack Knife. Huh? Apparently. That little one isn't afraid of anything. His name is Katak. I've heard that name before. That was his grandfather's name. The grandson of the famous Katak? Did I just hear that right? Uh, calm down, Daddy. His grandson is here? Uh, w... w... what are you talking about? It's you and me, Katak! I knew I'd end up getting sick! Shh! Oh, no! I know you're here, Katak! Don't be scared! It's Jack-Lynn. "It's Jack-Lynn." I warned you about her! Jack-Lynn: Katak, you're in danger! There you are. My father's looking for you. He knows who you are. And you led him right to us. Well done. No! Stop it, Cyrano. My dad's nowhere near here, but just be careful. Thank you! You see now? We can be friends. Ugh. "Thank you, Jack-Lynn." "Thank you, Jack-Lynn." Ugh, sure, thanks. Can't you see it's a trap? Ugh. Why would it be a trap? Are you jealous? Ha, me, jealous? Ha... Oh, I can't take this! Why isn't he coming back? Why did he leave without saying anything? He didn't think about me? He didn't think of his mother? Oh! He's gone to the great ice floe to look for his grandpa. What? And you knew and didn't say anything? Mother! I promised I wouldn't say anything. Have a little faith in Katak. He's still a child! He's more mature than you think. Oh, come on now. He's never even left here. He doesn't know the dangers. He's totally, totally oblivious! That's the way you see him. Mm-hmm. Oh! Oh, because you, you see him as a responsible adult? No, as a resourceful and courageous young male who needs to assert himself. Mom! Oh! Are you all right, Mom? Yes. Mm. Oh, I just don't understand. Going to look for his grandpa at the great ice floe? He's going to the great ice floe? Wow. All alone? Yah. Eh, no. He's not alone. There's someone watching over him. There's someone with him? Yeah. A sturgeon. Guh. Thank you. No worries. Safe travels. Safe travels to you as well! Be careful! He thinks he can escape me, that lousy little guppie. Are you ready? No. I'm not going to help you find him. Hmm? Do your own dirty work! All you do is think about yourself all the time. Jack-Lynn, I've been waiting for years to get my revenge on Katak, and I refuse to let him humiliate me any longer! I see. If your pride matters more to you than me, then just forget about me! Are we asserting our independence? Call it whatever you like. I'm leaving! And don't you dare follow me. I don't need you. Understand? I do! But you'll be back, little girl. You'll soon realize that you need family. And your family is me! Oh, I'm starving! They look good. Wow. What is that? Oh, that's good. Cyrano, are you seeing this? Ah! Hi! No, no, don't run away! Shh! It's me. Let's play. Come on! Ah. I haven't enjoyed a meal like that in a long time. You, Katak? Katak? Katak? Hey. Look at that. K, catch! Pass it! Here you go! I got it! I got it! Hold on, hold on. Over here! Lure it in! Oh! Katak! No! What are you doing? You're playing with her? Oh, boy. Jack-Lynn: It's my turn! No, it's mine! Ah! Hey, follow me. Wow. Whoa. It's my secret hiding place. Just for me. So cool. Oh! That's enough! Oh! You! You stay away from my friend. And Katak, I can't leave you alone for two minutes! Not so loud, Cyrano. Can't even grab a quick bite to eat without... watch out! Ah! Hello. Guess who's back? Katak, over here! Yeah! I'm coming! Oh! 1, 2, 3! Oh! Ugh! What the? I told you not to follow me! Jack-Lynn! I don't believe this. My own daughter betrays me? I didn't betray anyone! I'm just tired of you dwelling in the past. I can't take it! Jack-Lynn, you helped him to get away! I helped him because... because I can't stand violence! You know that. Would you mind telling me what you were doing with him? Nothing. I, um, uh, was exploring the wreck, and then we ran into each other. Eh? Jack-Lynn: By chance. But it's Katak! I would have done the same thing no matter who it was! If you're not going to help me, daughter, then make sure you stay out of my way. Ugh! I need to go. I think something's happened to him. I can feel it. I can feel it right here. He needs me. I have to help him! But you don't even know where he is. Yes, but... Mother. What is it, Mother? Are you in pain? Ow! Sorry about the scoots. Do you find my skin rough? Pretty much, yeah. It is. Lucky you're here. The only thing is now Jack Knife thinks I'm the enemy, too. Sorry about that. Do you want to go back? Not on your life. You're really not scared, are you? Not enough to leave you. My mom's going to be worried. That's for sure. My grandmother will, too. I hope she doesn't leave us before I get back. Well, we're almost there. Are you missing anyone? I have no family. Do you have any friends? Oh, friends, friends who just laugh at my nose. I don't need those. Oh, yeah, you're right. No one needs friends like that. The problem with your big nose, Cyrano, is that it hides all your great qualities. Oh, you. Where are you, Katak? Well, apparently, he's managed to escape twice from Jack Knife. He's a strong one, that one. As strong as his grandfather, eh? Whoa, I think you mean much stronger. Polestar! Oh! Tell me where Katak is, or I'll swallow her! Oh, we haven't seen Katak in ages! Oh, that's not true. We saw him three days ago. Remember? His friend got a cold. But... but I... I don't know where he is! It's true! I swear to you! Let her go! Go find him. You have five minutes to report back. If you don't... Ahh! Huh? That's the geese! I can't see! I can't see anything! Get going! First let her go! Get going! Help me, please! Oh! Oh, it's him. Where's it coming from? Ugh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, Polestar, I'm begging you, move. Oh. Oh, my Polestar. Say something. How are you doing, eh? Oh. That was impressive. So then it worked. How did you that would work on Jack Knife? That's what my grandpa did to escape. Grandma wasn't just making up stories. Meanwhile, we have no clue where he went. Shh. You know, if you want to talk about it, I'm listening. That was a pretty traumatic event. Oh, yeah, don't I know it. It's really not very good to bottle up your emotions. Oh, holy mackerel. There he is again. Stop. A killer whale. Hmm? Hey, wait for me! I think we can come out now, Cyrano. Think he's gone? Shh! Yeah, but we should still be quiet. Whoa. Oh, it's an iceberg! Oh, whoa. Wow. Wow. Hmm. Eh? Ah! Hey! Incredible. Is anyone else getting strange sensations? Run! Run away! Help! Move! Help! What? Bosco? Albi? Naya? Over here. Lulu, we're here. Uh, so Albi isn't here then? Mm-mm. Albi! Albi! Not so loud. The killer whale could be near. Albi? Albi! Albi! Albi! Albi! Albi! Albi! Albi! Huh? What? Cyrano. Huh? Hey wake up. Jack Knife? No, no, no. Listen. It must have been a dream. Almost there, Grandma. Hold on. Do you want some air? Mother? It's... it's Katak. Do you hear him? Oh, let him sleep. But we should tell him, eh? Jack Knife! There's no danger right now. Jack Knife's going six knots headed up north. Do you know the other one? What other one? The other one who is... you tell him. No, you. I can't do it. What? Oh, come. Albi? Is he OK? Mm-mm-mm. He's alive! Albi, are you OK? What are you doing here? Are you alone? Don't you recognize me? Minnow? He's fine. Come on, let's go. Hey! Where do you think you're going? I think we should keep going farther. No little gray baby's going to tell me where to go! You know, this little gray baby got as far as he did by escaping from Jack Knife. You think I believe that, you big schnoz? Ha! Ah! Hey! Katak, why are you letting this shrimp follow you? Because Cyrano is my best friend. 'Cause of you, we might miss our trip down south. What trip? Huh? What are you talking about? Did you hear that? Never mind. Sounds like Katak! You can go if you want. Yes! Yes, it's him! You nosy partner, no one asked you! OK, that's enough, you two. He's with Albi! Katak! Lulu! Oh, I'm so happy to see you! We finally found you! You came all this way just for me? Aw. Katak! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Haha! Woo-hoo! Aw, ho-ho, I just love reunions! Katak, why didn't you just tell me? Well, I have a lot to tell you now. Albi, what happened to you? Um, I don't know. Uh, I can't remember a thing. I was afraid I'd never see you again. Come on. You know me. Mm. Mm. You little guy. Took us on quite the journey. Good grief, Katak. What were you thinking? I'm sorry. Little twerp. Oh, clam up. Yeah, clam up. Listen, we need to make a little less noise. Jack Knife has attacked Katak a couple of times. What? Jack Knife, the killer whale? Shh! And up till now, we've always managed to get away from him. Ah, you've listened to too many of your grandma's stories. How, uh... how is Grandma doing? We don't know. Bosco, maybe it was Jack Knife who we saw before. Oh, come on! Don't say I didn't warn you. Are you ready for a sprint? Let's get going! Come on, guys. And 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 1 and 2 and 3. Let's go, swimmers. The race is on. Let's get you back to your mother. Not just yet. We're so close now! Follow me! Not a chance! Huh? Uh. D'oh. Katak, wait up. I promised Grandma I would find my grandpa. And there's no way I'm going back without him. That's what I figured. Come here! That's an order! No! We're on a mission. No use trying to stop them. Oh, boy. Jack-Lynn, let me just settle this. And when it's over, I... I'll be a better father. I promise you. Yeah, we'll see. But I... I... Oh. Wow. Wow. Wow. I've never seen anything so beautiful. Oh, sea unicorns! Grandma was right! They do exist! Oh. Huh? Whoa. You really don't look good. You made it. You did it. We did it. You don't need me anymore. That's not true. I'll always need a friend. But I think you should go back home before you cough up a gill. Yeah. I'm going to miss you. Thanks. I couldn't have done it without you. And without you, I wouldn't have gotten the trip of a lifetime. Take care of yourself. You, too. Hey, Katak! Come! Let's fill our bellies. Yeah, I'm coming! Huh? Cyrano? See you soon! I think everyone deserves to stop and rest for the night. Huh? Huh? We're trapped! It's a sab sack. A what? If we stay here, we won't be able to breathe. We're going to die! What should we do? Keep going further? Or should we turn back? I'll look for open water. Ha! I can hold my breath the longest. No, Katak. I should do that. Oh, have faith in me! I'll signal you when I find a way out. Oh, good luck. 1, 2, 3. What is that? A monster! We're never going to be able to breathe! 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. I didn't have time to take a deep breath. You? I'm going up! No, no, no! Ah! It's too risky. Hopefully there'll be another opening nearby. Huh? Quick! Get down! 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106. 1,201, 1,202, 1,203, 1,204, 1,205, 1,206. Oh, no! I can't hold my breath for much longer! 2,225, 2,226, 2,227. Oh, even Katak can't stay underwater much longer. Huh? Katak? Yes! Yes! It's him! Oh, yes! Looks like he found open water! He says to go towards the rising sun. Oh, well done, Katak! You're the best! Huh? Oh! Get out of here! Huh? Jack-Lynn? You leave that one alone! He's all mine! Yeah, thanks, Katak. Huh? Katak! Daddy! No, Jack-Lynn, stay back! Daddy! We've got to do something! Get away while you still can! Katak! Katak! Come here! Quick! We've got to get out of here! Come on! What are you doing? I can't just abandon my friend. Come on, Katak. It's a killer whale. But she saved my life. If you don't leave, it will all have been for nothing. Jack-Lynn. Let's go! Hurry up! Daddy. I just need to rest here a little bit. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have... Shh, shh, shh, shh, my little girl. Live your life the way you want. You're losing all your strength. It's nothing. My wounds will heal. No! No, it's bad. Let me help you. You see, you are strong. I love you, Daddy. Stay with me, please. I love you, too. Huh? Bah! Look, another pod! Whoa! They look exactly like us! The mothers with their babies. Aw, the last time I saw a baby, I was a little bitty baby. Is this a dream? We made it! I tell you, the other day, the sea unicorns were floating on quite the... Hey, did you all hear that? That sound, is that... Quick, let's go see! Oh, other belugas! Hi! Hello! I don't think we've ever met. There sure are a lot of you here. Yep, a whole pod. That's right. Come on, let me introduce you. I knew it! Woo-hoo! It's beautiful here! Hey, you're from the river. Bears? My dear lady, we had a narrow escape. Oh, wow. Do you know a Katak? You followed the shore the whole way here? If you see my grandfather, tell me! And we came across the killer whale. He's got an anchor-shaped scar. Did you hear? Apparently, they're from the river. His name's Katak, like me! No, they came all this way? They must be exhausted. He has a scar. There are belugas in the river? He's my grandfather. Told you. Uh, do you often see polar bears? All the time. Killer whales as well. How about floaters? They come up here? Yeah, more and more. It's really annoying. Yeah, but you have so many little ones. You don't where you come from? No. My name's Cammy. Lulu. Nice to meet you. Huh? Grandpa! Could it be that I have a grandson from the river? Your name's Katak? Yes, and my mother, uh, your daughter is named Marina. Marina. But that's not why I came to see you. It's for Grandma. Do you remember her? She took care of you. Oh, of course. I could never forget her. She always talks about you. She does? Yes! She says she still loves you. And you traveled all this way to tell me that? No, I came here to get you. She's going to leave us soon, and I'd like for her to be happy. You're just like me, you know. Really? I also was late turning white. And did it bother you? Mm, a bit. And you? Mm, a bit. You know, your color isn't what's important. What counts is what you have in here. It's Jack-Lynn. She lost her dad. Do you like Jack-Lynn? It's my fault she's all alone right now. I know it's sad for your friend, but thanks to you, the belugas are now free from a fierce and cruel predator. Yeah. I didn't know I had a grandson who was this courageous. Jack Knife is gone, and your friendship with Jack-Lynn, for me, is a sign of hope. You should go and see her. You OK? I just feel so bad. I didn't think I needed him, but... but now that he's not here. I understand. You miss him. Very much. Thanks for saving my life. I think I'll stay here for a little while. Will I see you again? Maybe. But for sure, we'll be friends for life. Hey! Uh, don't turn away too fast, OK? If you do, I won't recognize you. How about we go explore over that way? Want to go for a swim, Lulu? OK. Huh? Your cousin Katak seems really cool. Katak seems really cool. Is it true what they're saying about Jack Knife? Ugh, a digger. Oh, and a floater! Quick! Let's get out of here! Oh, what are we doing here? It's worse than back home. There's bears, killer whales, floaters, and diggers. Yeah, but there's cute little babies, too. It's becoming harder and harder for us to live here. You know, in the river, there are places where the floaters don't go. Really? Yeah, the protected zone. The protected zone? There aren't any predators either. Really? Oh, I'm afraid of bears. Can we go where you live? Ah, my dear boy, you're welcome whenever you want. Friends, it's time to leave. Destination... the Saint Lawrence River. In the end, Katak, it wasn't a bad idea at all coming here. We can't predict the future, but with all these little ones we're bringing back, we might have saved the pod from extinction. I can't wait to get to where you live so our little ones can grow up safely. Oh, yes, in the protected zone! In any case, we no longer need to go south with the other whales. What? We're not going south? You know, your grandmother sure had character. She hasn't changed. You must take after her. Oh! Woo! Hey! Little one! Hey! Hello! Hello, cod ladies! Is that him? No. Yes! Hello! Hi! Hi, belugas. He's the one I was talking about! He saved my life! Katak! Hi! It's thanks to him that we're free of Jack Knife! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Wow, your cousin's a real legend around here. Katak! Safe travels back! No problem! Uh, Minnow... uh, Katak? Uh, sorry for being such a, um... It's all right, Albi. Safe travels! See you later! Welcome to Terusack. Oh, my. It's so beautiful here. Come on! I want to show you the fjords. Not that it's any of my business, but those two there. Mm-hmm. Grandma? Grandma, take a look. Katak? My love. It's been a long time. Too long a time. Mm. You're as beautiful as I remember. Mom, I know you're upset with me... Ah, but you came back. And I'm so very proud of you! Mm. I have so much to tell you. I'd even say Grandma's feeling better. First, tell me about you. Do you have children? Any grandchildren? Huh? Katak! Hey, Katak's looking lighter, huh? Nope, I didn't turn any whiter. But it doesn't bother me. I am what I am. Then stay like that. You're pretty cool. What do you say, Katak, to coming and living with the males? For real? Yeah. Ya-hoo! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Wa-ha-ha-ha! Woo-hoo! Ha-ha! Oh, Cyrano! Well done, champ! Woo-hoo! Yay! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Grandma? Grandma, I really wish you were here today. Estelle finally became a mother. Oh, it's a little girl, Estelle! Very healthy. Welcome, little gray one.
