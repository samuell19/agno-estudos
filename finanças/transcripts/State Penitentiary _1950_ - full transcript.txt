42 miles from the nearest city, stretched along the bank of the river, stands the State Penitentiary, a sinister warning to the lawbreaker that here is the end of the road. Here is where he must be separated from law-abiding society. The men inside these prison walls are learning their lesson all too well. Some of them, most in fact, will profit by it and emerge from here as better men, better citizens to resume normal life, normal friendships. Their debt to society paid in full. Others, however, convicts, habitual offenders hardened to crime, all beyond the pale, must of necessity continue on here through drab fruitless years their lives dedicated to an unhappy meaningless existence confined to barred cells and forbidding barricades. And until the end of their time, these unfortunate men will continue to be watched and guarded as they live in a cheerless city of grey walls, great towers, grey uniforms and grey men. As its warden, I'm charged with the care and discipline of approximately a thousand men convicted of offenses against the State. Inside each of these cells is a man and a story. This is John Bartoli, five years, robbery Clark Jackson, three years, assault with a deadly weapon. Jerry Howard 20 to life, murder of a policeman. This man is Rodger Manners. You may have seen his picture in your newspapers when his trial was front page news. He has spent two years of his life inside this prison. Two years, 22 days, six hours. It was a dreary day when Rodger Manners saw the gates of the prison open. Gates that were too close and deprived him of a world of free men. And here he was to become familiar with the clang of pails against steel doors, the smell of disinfectant in the cell blocks and mark the time of night by the cries of the watchman calling the hours. He had been convicted for embezzlement. His sentence was from three to five years. How about a statement, Mr. Manners? How about that 400 grand that got stashed away? Give us a break, whether we have to print something. You can print that I'm innocent. What about the Manners' plane? They'll roll off the assembly line someday. What does your wife think about the verdict? My wife took no part in the trial at my request. I'd like to keep it that way. How do you feel about it? He's pretty slick. I'd spend a little vacation there myself if I could be sure I had four hundred grand waiting for me. Incidentally, I'm a little bent. Which one of you guys can slip me a fin till payday? Now Rodger Manners became part of an isolation company. A baker's dozen of new inmates, still uninitiated into the ways of life inside the walls. Here was an 18 year old farm boy, a department store executive, a drugstore clerk, a brilliant aeronautical engineer. A couple of suits of denim with cap to match would be his clothes from now on. A stenciled number on the back of his jacket would take the place of his name. The regulation prison photo was the next step in his indoctrination. Okay. All right, you're all done. You can take this and report back to isolation. And, by the way, if you want me to run off any extra prints to send to your friends at Christmas, I'll make you a very special rate. Thanks. And now Rodger Manners was being led through an intricate system of forbidding steel doors. His outer transformation was complete. No longer was he president of the Manners Aircraft Corporation. Now just one more convict. Number 1 - 1 - 4 - 1 - 6 - 2. Got a new cellmate for you, Beaumont. Break him right. Sure, sure thing. I'll tell him all there is to know. You'd better start telling yourself what's the idea of a messed-up bunk. Oh, it's just resting. - Al, straighten it up. - Yes, sir. - My name is Manners. - What's your first name? - Rodger. - Rodger, that's better.. I'm Al Beaumont, my friends call me Kid. All right, Kid. - First offense? - Yeah. I thought so. Why, you'd have been in worse places. What'd they get you for? Let's not talk about it. We haven't still talked about it. If I was guessing, I'd say grand larceny. No, you're wrong. I was guilty of embezzlement. Say, that's a pretty big word. What does it mean? I'm supposed to have illegally appropriated $400,000. Well, that's a lot of dough, brother! You're really big-time. How'd you do it? I'm sorry I can't tell you the secret, because I'm not guilty. Oh, so they gave you a bum rap, huh? Yeah, that's right. I know, Rodger. Everyone here got a bum rap. I was framed. Even me. How do you think I shot that cashier in Des Moines? Nah, my fingerprints was planted on the gun. Only nobody believes me, see? And there ain't nobody gonna believe you. You know why? 'Cuz it ain't true. Well, you have it your way. Hey, Kid. Are you there, Kid? Yeah, Jim, what do you want? Can you keep a secret? Sure, what's it now, Jim? Tomorrow, I've got it all worked out. Tomorrow. Fine. I wish you luck. That was "jailbreak" Jimmy. Crazy as a coo. Always he's breaking out tomorrow. - Is that the girlfriend? - It's my wife. A pretty nice dish. How'd you better make up that bunk of yours? Oh, Rodger, don't be talking like one of them trustees. Besides, I ain't cleaning it up. You are. - I am? - Yeah. Don't you know the rules? The new guy always takes care of the cell. - Who made that rule? - Me. Look, brother. It ain't good to be getting into trouble on your first day. Okay, Kid. Looks like you got yourself a new chamber maid. And so Rodger Manners started learning about the penitentiary. He learned to get up at 5:30 in the morning and to be part of a line that started marching aimlessly, mechanically down the same corridors, up the same steps toward a day ahead that would be just like any other day. March... march... march... always in prison file, always being watched. always being counted, the same routine, the same faces, the same hopelessness the same futility. Nothing to look forward to, except a tomorrow that would be no different from today. He learned to eat in the big mess hall. Nobody talked, nobody left. The menu was always very much the same: A course of prison grub. The only dinner music, the sound of tin plates and tin cups. With guards on all sides, watching here too. And so another day began, another day in the city of lost men where, in time, each one had his particular work cut out for him. And Rodger Manners wondered what his would be. Maybe he'd be assigned to work on making license plates, or perhaps he would be put into the jute mill where convicts labored monotonously, preparing vile-smelling fiber for ropes or sacks. Or maybe he'd draw work in the carpenter shop, where the better skilled could make real use of their hands. or he might learn to run a machine and help make bags, gunnysacks or suits of denim. Rodger Manners was curious as to just how he would be asked to fit into this prison pattern. And then, one day he was called to report to the board of classification. Kitchen job, huh? Okay, you're next. Let's have your card. Manners, Rodger. 1-1-4-1-6-2. College education, graduate engineer. Married. No children. - Sit down, Manners. - Thank you. How would you like to go to work? It isn't compulsory, it's privileged. I appreciate the permit, sir. This new water system we're installing seems like you could fit in there. That sounds very interesting. With my engineering experience, I think probably that I-- It's heavy labor. Well, I... I've done heavy labor before. Is he physically fit, doctor? - He's okay. - Then, have him report there for work. The officer out in the hall will tell you where to report. Thank you, sir. Rodger Manners was assigned to the detail which had been working to install new intake pipes that which supply and filter the river water to the prison. The work of repairing the prison water system, like any other job inside the penitentiary, offered prisoners an opportunity to earn money at the rate of 7 to 17 cents per hour. And industrial good time applied against total sentence: Two days for a month's work. - Gavin! - Yeah. - Come out here. - Coming out! - Rodger Manners. - Yeah, what do I do with him? He's an engineer assigned to your detail. Gavin will show you the ropes. Well, ain't you impressed having this fine gentleman working right along with mugs like us? What do you mean impressed? Why, he's Mr. big shot of stocks and bonds. Snitched 400 grand out of a putt when the rest of the boys wasn't looking. Can't hardly blame him for not want to have nothing to do with our small fry. How's the market today, old fellow? Should I sell my 20 shares of the prison's stock? I came here to work. What do you want me to do? Tell me where we can grab 400 grand. Oh, he don't share no secrets like that with us, punkers. Anyway, he didn't steal no 400 grand. He just put it in his pocket. Oh, I see what you mean, Kid. Can't understand how a fine distinguished gentleman like him could be put in with a bunch of guys like us. Yeah, it might get bad ideas. Where are you going? I was assigned here, but if you don't need me, I guess the guard can find another job. - You got a pretty thin hide, Manners. - Yeah, maybe. You gotta learn to take more than just a little ride. - I have. - You have? You gotta've learnt to take a lot more than that while you're here. What's going on, Gavin? Oh, I was just showing Mr. Manners here the ropes and he kinda just slipped and fell. - Is that what happened? - Sure that's what happened. I'm asking Manners. Yeah, that's right. He was showing me the ropes. The prison routine permitted inmates a recreational period before dinner. - Hey! - Hello. - Are you really an engineer? - Well, I used to think I was. Know anything about airplanes? I ought to. - I design them. - You do? I make models. When I get one that's perfect, then I'll build me a real plane and will fly outta here. I wish you all the luck in the world. You can help me get me some pointers. But, can I trust you? Yes, your secret's safe with me. Good, I knew you're a right guy. - Look at this. - Well, that's quite a shift. The guards think I'm just playing with toys, but you and me, we know better, don't we? Yes. When I'm ready to make my getaway, I'm gonna take off in this plane. Over that tower. Like this. - Hey, guard! - What do you want? Throw me down my plane. Look. Look what he did to my plane. Before I get out of here, I'll get even with that guy. Manners had been in prison for almost two months when he had his first visitor: Richard Evans, from the office of the State Attorney. My job is to get him to talk and it's not going to be easy. Well, I just sent for him; let's see. He'd better start opening up and fast because the boss is almighty. He only expects me to produce a rabbit out of the hat. All I've got to say, Evans, is you've your work cut out for you. And I think in the thousands of people he gypped. Why, he built Manners' playing up in the two million dollar's worth of orders. It's a neat trick. All he had was six handmade model planes, some full-page newspaper ads and a slogan: "The plane of tomorrow. The common man takes to the sky." - Yes? - Rodger Manners. Send him in. Manners, I believe you know Mr. Evans, of the State Attorney's office. Yes, sir. I thought it was time we had another talk. - You know what I'm after. - Yeah. - Four hundred thousand? - That's right. Well, I haven't got it. I've never had it. I don't know where the money is. Manners, you're never gonna get a chance to spend that money. When you get out of here, I would be after you with a badge and a gun. Look here. I've been tried and convicted for something I didn't do. Manners, we have about a thousand men here. 80% of them would tell me the same thing. They were framed, misunderstood, taking the rap for someone else. It's the usual story. Let's face it. You had your day in court. Mr. Evans doesn't think so. He wouldn't be here. That's right. There's one little chapter left. I've got to find that money, that's my job. Your job: to question and badger me, to annoy my friends, to pinch and probe until you hit the right nerve and $400,000 pops out. Well, it's not going to, Mr. Evans. You can tell that to your boss. Making it tough on yourself, Manners. If you give Mr. Evans a little cooperation-- Oh, it's no use, warden. I'm no longer an innocent man fighting to save my skin. Now I'm a con, like everybody else here. And a con doesn't tell you a thing. Is that's all you're going to say? That's all it is. - Now let me go, warden? - You can go. Well, now what are you gonna do? Sit tight and wait. Get it in time. Time is one thing he's got a lot of. He'll come around. The recreation period to some inmates meant strolling to and fro in the prison yard, playing checkers, tossing a base ball or just plain small talk. Need guidance. They aren't using the right pitchers. It's the umpire. How do you know? You can't tell balls and strikes from here. On this particular afternoon, the keepers of the grapevine were working overtime. And Todd Richardson, the guard, patrolling the main tower and the center catwalk knew it. "Sharp Eye" convicts called him. And he'd earned that name. He could spot trouble a mile away. Today he scents something unusual brewing. Something was in the air. "Sharp Eye" was sure of it. He could tell by the way the cons were moving about the yard. The way they whispered to each other. But what spot would trouble strike first? East corner, five minutes. We're circling Duke Thomas. East corner, five minutes, Duke Thomas. Five minutes, over in east corner, get a little party for Duke Thomas. Circle, east corner. Duke Thomas in five minutes. The east corner. Duke Thomas. Duke, They'd kill me if they knew I was tipping you. Look out, Duke, Gavin's mob is out to get you. They won't get me. Not a chance. It's time for Duke's party. You're against me too. You did a good job, Manners. Thanks. Do you think it'll get me a gold medal? The courage which Roger Manners had displayed was naturally resented by most of his fellows convicts. Manners, however, went back to work on the water main detail. Come on, break it up. Get back on your job. Come on! The huge pipes that sucked water from the river and pulled it through screens and chlorine filters had been installed in the early 1900's. Now they were being dragged from the earth and replaced with copper fittings manufactured in the prison workshops. Manners detail toiled under the circuits using acetylene torches to blast worn sections free, so that new sections could be installed. How's your friend "Jailbreak" Jimmy? He's being sent to the State Hospital. The poor guy went to pieces. He's completely mixed up and he's done now. Oh, it's too bad. Yeah, it'll be too bad for you if you don't keep your nose out of things that don't concern you. If I hadn't stopped him, he might've killed that guard. So what? I think there are plenty of guards here. - I can't figure you out. - Don't try. You're old enough to know right from wrong. You're older than I am and you're my cellmate, remember? Ah, but I forgot. You're in here for something you didn't do. You don't believe that, do you? Who am I to disagree with the judge and jury? Say, remind me tonight I've got a book I want you to read. I think it'll do you some good. - Did you read it? - Yes, I did. And you didn't understand it, did you? Hey, Manners. Take this over to Costello. - Costello? - Yeah, he's over by the valve house. Okay. Hey, wait a minute. What have you got there? - Some broken pipe. - Wait while I take a look. Okay. Why didn't you tell me that stuff was hot? - I didn't know it. - All right, get it out of here. All right. - This goes to you? - Yeah. Be careful. Careful, it's hot. Are you telling me? Thanks, Manners. Thanks a lot. Don't mention it. What are you trying to pull? Huh? Next time you want somebody deliver a gun, find a different pigeon. What are you worried about? If they did find it in your load, they wouldn't do nothing. You're their favorite boy by now. Whatever you're planning, leave me out. You mean you wouldn't wanna get someplace where you could spend some of the 400 G's you got stashed away? That's exactly what I mean. Oh, maybe you'll change your mind. But even in prison, there's an occasional satisfying tie with the world outside. A monthly visit. Mrs. Manners, here's your husband. I have waited a long time for this day. I've been waiting too, darling. Yeah, now that is here will be over before we know, Shirley. 'Cause I just have a few minutes. A few minutes, you stay so much? Where should we begin? Oh, yes. There was the man from the State Attorney's office who came to see me. Evans? He said he might arrange your release if you turn over the money. What did you tell him? Don't get me started on that, darling. Oh, I'd wish they'd leave you off that, Shirley. It's my problem. Ours, dear. We're partners, Rodger. Partners in everything. Speaking of partners, I can't get Stan Brown out of my mind. I've been lying awake nights thinking about him. I just can't figure him out. - I can't understand it either? - Have you heard of him? I had a letter. He's back in Florida raising orchids. Mortgages, aeroplanes, orchids. that's quite a leap. What did he say? Asked how you were. If there was anything he could do for either one of us, to let him know. Do you think that help will come in late? Very late. He could've helped me at the trial. When he took the stand, I thought his testimony would help me and, instead, it was so noncommittal. Well, it was actually detrimental. And then he turned out to be the prosecution's star witness. I just don't get it, that's all. Try not to think about it, darling. I can't help it. It's not that easy. He didn't even come to see me when the trial was over. Time is up. Good-bye, dear. - Come back soon, huh? - You know I will. Hello, Ms. Manners. A pleasant visit? Pleasant? I'd hardly call it that. Talking to your husband through a wire grill. I know he told you he'll have to look forward to for five long years. Yeah, that's pretty tough. In a way, it's your own choice. He could be out of here in no time if you cooperate with me. I gave you my answer when you came to my house, Mr. Evans. Rodger doesn't have that money. I don't suppose he has. Not in his cell, anyway. But you might know where it is. Let's see, 10% of 400,000 is 40,000, is that right? There's nothing wrong with your arithmetic, but I don't follow you. It's quite simple: the insurance company is willing to pay 10% for the recovery of stolen funds. 40,000 would be yours. No headaches, no strings. It's worth thinking about, isn't it? Yes, it is worth thinking about. I wouldn't waste any time making my mind if I were you. Our department works fast. If they get there first, you lose your 10%. I understand you perfectly, Mr. Evans. I thought you would. A few days later, Mrs. Manners was on a plane. Florida-bound. She had a mission to perform, a daring one. On the plane she kept thinking that a fair mission would free her husband. That was all that mattered. Were you surprised that I took you up without an invitation, Stan? No, but I was happy you did. The change will do you a world of good. I just had to get away, Stan. New York more than you could take? It certainly was. When my friends came to see me, it was only so they can go home and gossip about me. Oh, get my car, will you, please? You're bearing it better than I thought you would. I'd say you look as lovely as ever. You always did say nice things, but I'm afraid it's just the makeup. No. Oh, yes, rouge can do wonders. I'm tired and worn. This hasn't been an easy time. Not easy for any of us, but here you won't find any of your gossipy friends. You'll have the run of the place. I'm glad you came. I am already. Oh, here's our car. I paid reservations for you at the Carlson Hotel. I'm getting a terrible burn! That's a nice tan. It's becoming. Thank you, sir. In fact on you, anything is becoming. Thanks again, sir. Why the big sigh? I don't know. I guess I'm all mixed up. Mixed up? It's you and I, Stan. Are we all wrong? What do you mean, wrong? The fun we've been having the last few weeks. So what? No harm in having a few laughs together. No, I suppose not. But... What's the use of pretending? - What do you think of my orchids? - Oh, they're breathtaking. I'm very proud of them. Orchid raising has always been a hobby of mine. Now, it's my job. This one is gorgeous. Would you like to wear it tonight? Oh, I'd love to. Stan, do you think it's all right our being seen together? Why not? Look, what Rodger has done, you've got to get out of your mind. You've got your own life to live. That's what I tried to tell myself. I know. I... I've given it a great deal of thought. - Stan... - Yes, Shirley. I don't know how to say this, but ?would it be terrible if I divorced Rodger? Well, now that you ask me, Shirley, it seems the only sensible thing to do, unless, of course, you enjoy being a martyr. I don't. - I think I'm selfish. - We're all selfish more or less. Remember this: you didn't embezzle the money. You weren't sentenced. You make me feel better already. Here. Another visitors day. Manners have been waiting for it, his heart pounding a bit faster, expecting to see his wife again. But, instead... You don't seem very pleased to see me. I wasn't expecting you. I didn't want you to be lonesome while your wife is in Florida. Florida? Don't tell me you didn't know she was there. I haven't received any mail lately. So any information you can give will be greatly appreciated. I have a picture over here taken on Stanley Brown's place in Florida. Kind of chirpy, because you were enjoying yourself, didn't you? Is this another one of your little tricks? No, Manners, it's on the level. You sure you don't wanna tell me anything else? Don't you ever give up? Look here, leave my wife out of this, will you? - I don't have to. - You're doing that yourself. Sometimes I find the privacy of myself has its advantages. Good-bye, Evans. Hey, what's the matter with Mr. stocks and bonds? A dame. It is a dame, ain't it, Manners? Is it? And how do you know? She's divorcing the guy. Oh, cut it out, Kid. You're breaking my heart. Ain't kidding. - Look here. - Hey, give me that. All right, break it up. Back on the job. Yes, sir. Hey, Manners... - You're an engineer, ain't you? - That's right. The warden wants you to take over the job in the valve house. You oughta regulate the flow through the pipes. Report to Davis and he'll break you in. - Gavin! - Yeah. You'll have to do without him on this detail. Sure, sure. During the next month, Rodger Manners became familiar with the manipulation of the intricate system of valves which control the intake and outflow of water. It was necessary that the water be constantly guided in and out of the sections where the replacement of the pipe was in progress. When the day's work was over, the prisoners returned to their cells, past the same guards, down the same corridors up the same steps, tired, sweaty, hungry, to relax until the recreation and dinner out. But, at least to Rodger Manners, it was another day to be checked off the calendar. One day less to serve, one day closer to being with his wife, one day nearer to being a free man again. What are you doing here? - I'm taking my beauty rest. - Where's the "Kid"? Oh, he got into a fight. Get solitary. So they put me in here, just to fill in the cell. The Kid knows better than to get in a fight. - Now, you think so, would-- - Say, look, Gavin, I don't know what you're trying to pull or what you're after but I'm not part of it. You were part of this. I never did thank you for getting it out of the tunnel, did I? I may have been a fall guy once. Once is enough. Why don't you tell the guards about the gun, then? No. What you do is your business. That's a healthy attitude. You don't really think you can break out of here, do you? Now, what gave you that idea? You don't have that gun just to play with. I thought you weren't interested. Of course, we might not need the gun. That's if everything goes okay. On the other hand, it might come in handy. Just like you. 400 G's just waiting for you to spend them. Why do you want me in this with you? Well, maybe we like you. Then, maybe we could use some of that dough when we get out. And maybe we might need you. What's that for? Oh, I just like to know the date. Which reminds me I forgot to mark off today. What's that for? The circle around the 30th. What's so special about it? - The 30th? - Yeah. That's my aunt Abigail's birthday. Gotta remember to send her a card. May finish the job on the water pipes tomorrow. There's another month's work on that detail. Yeah. But we finish tomorrow. - Wanna know how I figured? - No. It's an engineering problem, right up your alley. Look here, if you've got anything set for tomorrow, don't tell me. Just I don't wanna know anything about it. Keep your shirt on. We're just having a harmless little discussion on an engineering problem. I want your advice. - I'm not listening. - Okay, so you're not listening. So I'll sort of talk about it nice and loud, so I can hear what it sounds like. Yeah, I can't keep you from talking. What I'm wondering is this: for over two months now, we've have been working on a water pipe that's part of the water system. And according to my amateur calculations, which should be all about 30 feet long. Do you agree with my figures? I haven't been down the pipes in weeks. I don't know where you are. Oh, that's right. You work in the valve house with the control of pumps. I almost forgot. What a head! Well, anyway, if we're at the spot where I think we are, right close by there's a pipe that makes a big swing. Now, the question is: where is the big swing? Wanna know what my answer is? Right where we're working. So, what? I thought you weren't listening. Now, if these two pipes are as close together as I think they are, all we gotta do is cut through our pipe, dig 8 inches and just by chance, we might hit into the inflow pipe. All you gotta do is cut a hole, crawl in and go down to the river. You're crazy! Now, what do you wanna say a thing like that for? Because the intake is full of water. Well, that's right. The pumps are always working, aren't they? Well, take a look at this, anyway. It can't do any harm just looking. You said it wouldn't work. You've been wasting your time. Why? Because the intake pipe is always full of water? That's right. You know, I just happen to realize. That pump is controlled in the valve house and all somebody has to do: just cut off the pump. You leave me out of this, Gavin. You are in this. The question is how far in. This seemed like any other day in the prison to most of the prisoners, but to Gavin and his crowd, it had a particular significance. Today was their big day. Today they would know. If Mike Gavin's calculations were correct, the section of pipe in which they were now working was separated by a scant eight inches from the intake conduit bend to the river and to freedom. At approximately 4:00 in the afternoon, on November the 30th, they had a chance to test their theory. Come on, come on. - We're almost there now. - If this is the right place. Don't worry, it's the right place. Maybe it is, maybe it ain't. We could've made a mistake, you know. Yeah, and if the guards find this hole we cut in their pipe, they may not like it. Guards never got their uniforms dirty by falling down here. They ain't likely to start now. We've gotten there. I guess you didn't make no mistake. I guess I didn't. Look, you guys clean up this mess. I'll be right back. - Can you handle him alone? - Don't worry, I can handle. Hi, Manners. Mind if I come in? Do you know there's only supposed to be one man in here? That's too bad. I guess I forgot. Yeah? What do you want? - I've got some news for you. - Uh-huh, what kind of news? Good news. At least, we think it's good. Remember that intake pipe I was telling you about? I don't know what you're talking about. But we found it. What's the matter? You don't look so happy. I said we found the pipe. Now all we need is somebody to shut up the pump so we can get out of here. I'm not having any part of this. Don't you like to go down to Florida and check up on that wife of yours? You can't blame me for trying. By the way, I've got some more news for you. So what? So this is gonna come in handy, after all. You got the guards will hear you? With all this racket down here, try again. All right, go ahead and shut it. You like me turn off the valve for you? You're a smart boy, but I'll take my chances. Which pump is it? This one? Look out, that turns off the whole water supply. Will be noticed. Well, lay that, it's too bad. So the warden will miss his bubble bath. But that'll be a cold night. Besides, it ain't helpful to take a bath this time of the year. You can still come along if you want. No, thanks, Gavin. Think of all the living you can do on 400 G's. Besides, you can keep that gal from getting lonesome. I said no. Okay, have it your way. But you're in this fight up to here already, so you might as well come along. Suppose I do decide to go along with you. Now you're talking sense. Wait till we cut through the pipe, ten minutes, no more, then make a break for it. Yeah, but I'm not saying that I'm coming. Don't worry 'cause we ain't waiting for you. What if the pump isn't turned off? So you'll get your feet wet. Come, on come on, let's go. Captain, the water is off. See what's the matter. Hey, Manners, what's going on down there? Nothing, nothing at all. The water is off up on the warden's quarters and he wants it turned on right away. Okay. Hey, Manners, are you sure you didn't turn off the water? - By mistake, maybe. - No, I didn't turn it off. Find out the trouble and be quick about it, will you? Sure, leave it to me. Hey, the master pump is off. How do you they expect the guy to take a bath, huh? Water! Water! Water! Did you turn the pump off, Manners? - No, sir. I didn't - Then who did? I can't tell you, sir. No need to shield anyone. When I first came here, I was told I was a prisoner. Like any other prisoner. - All right, go back to your cell. - Thank you. Where have you been, Manners? We know where he's been, don't we, guys? Sure, he's been to see the warden. And the warden is mighty proud of him. He is a swell guy. He turned on the watering. Drowned a con. Why aren't you in solitary with the other guys? That's a good question, Chris. Yeah, ain't it? You know, it's a funny thing, but I don't think he knows the answer. Yeah. I sure hate to think he lied on it. You know, if we were sure he turned the water on, we'd have to do something about it. I wonder what we'd do. Probably slap him around. Rodger Manners was admitted to the prison hospital for multiple fractures of the elbow joints, lacerations and possible internal injuries. At the end of three weeks, his convalescence was progressing satisfactorily. Hey, Tony. I wonder if you-- A caller. I heard you had a little trouble. What do you want? Well, I thought maybe you wanted something. You know, books, candy, magazines... So I got the warden's permission to come and see you. No, thanks. I'm all right. That's just a social call. Wasn't it quite a surprise about your wife and Stanley Brown? What have you dreamed up now? Listen, if she gets a divorce, she's going to marry your partner Stan Brown. You're lying. My wife wouldn't double-cross me. Not just you, me too. What are you talking about? Ten percent wasn't enough. I still don't get it. Evidently, she wants a hundred percent. So now we're both out in the cold. Why don't you stop talking riddles? It's just a riddle to you. The insurance company is willing to pay 10 percent to regain stolen funds. Your wife knew about this, but it wasn't enough. She wanted the whole thing and she didn't wanna wait five years to get it. Oh, that's a rotten lie! Don't get yourself all worked up. You don't have to believe if you don't want to. Well... Here, have some cigarettes. You may need to smoke. Come on, yeah! Hit him, come on! Come on, boy! Well, hello. I thought I was still getting the silence treatment. Oh, not from me. We are old friends, ain't we? Besides, a guy can't be too choosy in a place like this. What you know? Here's something new on that doll of yours. - Huh? - Says she's getting married. Let me see that paper, will you? Sure, take a look. Hey, Manners, the warden wants to see you. Look, he wants to let me out? Wow, it'd be nice, but I doubt it. So do I. Let's go. Stoolie! Hi, rat. - Sit down, Manners. - Thanks. The warden tells me you asked permission to talk to me. Yes, that's right. Oh, what's on your mind? I think that I can deliver that money. Good. Now you're making sense. Well, you decided to be more cooperative. I'm sure you won't regret it. Why? I'm not sure you quite understand me, warden. I haven't the money. All right, you gave it to someone to keep it for you. Just tell us where it is. Let me out of here for 48 hours and I promise you results. And, more than that, I'll turn over the man who stole it. I don't think you realize what you're asking. This isn't a school where we can declare a recess. Well, for months now you've been asking me for the money. Here's your chance to get it. I'm afraid not, Manners. Even if I was inclined to grant your request, there are laws forbidding it. - I'm sorry. - Tell me where I can find him. Tell me who you think the guilty man is, and if you're right, you'll have a chance to go free. This proposition seems very fair. I want to turn over the money myself. You didn't cook up this little plan just to get to your wife, did you? Maybe. If you change your mind, I'll get in touch with Evans. Thank you, sir. Well, when are you leaving? Tuesday... 1953. Say, Manners, what did the warden wanna see you about, anyway? He assigned me back to the valve house. I'm supposed to report back there right away. Say, look, Tom, is there any way you can get me back there other than going through the yard? I don't wanna go through that ordeal again. Sure, I'll take you through the sideway. Come on. Thanks. Thanks, Tom. I got assigned here to work with you. Couldn't have picked the worst rat. Why, you-- Listen, I may have to work with you, but I don't have to talk to you. What are you doing? Following orders. I'm supposed to release some of the water in the summer. All right, Evans if you wanna have another try at him, I'll call him. Watchtower? Watchtower. Yes, warden. I took him over the valve house. He told me you assigned him to it. Yes, sir. Right away. Come on. Thanks for the lift. - Have a good time. - Thanks. Hello. Is Mr. Brown in? Mr. Brown isn't at home right now. But I'm expecting him and a lady for dinner. Thanks. I... I'll call back later. Hello, Manners. Oh, give me a break, will you? You'll have that money in a couple of hours. - No. My job is to bring you in. - Just let me talk to Brown. Look, I'll get the truth out of him. You can come along with me. I'm not taking any chance. Well, is this just as much your duty to... to help an innocent man as it is to convict a guilty one? Well, what's Brown address? 2662, Dilido Island, just a couple of hours from here. - Okay. - Yeah. Well, our plane for Rio leaves at midnight. I think you'd better go to your hotel and pack. I'm not going, Stan. Not going? That's nonsense. What are we running away from? You think we had something to hide. You're not as smart as I thought you were, Shirley. What would you have us do? Stay here and get in a jam with Rodger? I'm not afraid of Rodger. I don't understand you. I gave you my answer. I'm not going, Stan. It's final. Oh, think it over, dear. I'll be down at the greenhouse. You should have a change of heart. I'm glad you changed your mind. I've always said I had one of the world's most valuable orchid collections. Is there anything I could do to help? You put the family fortune into the valise. Everything is dark. Looks like they're out for the evening. Well, they've left for good. Well, I guess there's nothing to do but take you back. Wait a minute, wait. Look. Okay, let's start walking. I gotta put this into my pocket. Petty cash. Shirley, are you out of your mind? I never was more sane in my life. Put that petty cash in the valise, too. - But, Shirley, I... I... - Do as I tell you, Stan. I'll need that money to clear Rodger. You'll never get the chance to. Now, Manners, I'm gonna have to take you back to prison. I don't think you'd be there very long this time. After due process of law, Rodger Manners was given his release. After two years, twenty-two days and six hours, Rodger Manners left the State Penitentiary, a free man. - Now, Manners, goodbye and good luck. - Thank you, warden. Good-bye. Good-bye. Shirley! Rodger! Transcription and subtitle made by gamboler[noirestyle]
